<p class="calibre1">Introduction:</p>
<p class="calibre1">This	story,	my	very	first	short	piece	of	fiction,	was	written	back	in	the	summer	of 1979.	I	had	spent	a	couple	of	years	working	on	a	fantasy	novel	and	as	I	let	that sit	fallow	for	a	time,	I	turned	my	thoughts	to	writing	some	short	fiction.	There was	a	bit	of	a	boom	in	the	SF	field	back	in	those	days	(largely	because	of	STAR</p>
<p class="calibre1">WARS),	and	I	thought	I’d	try	my	hand	at	cranking	out	something	for	the	market. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	concept	for	the	story	came	out	of	reading	an	article	about	the	Iron	Curtain, which	back	in	those	days	was	still	an	overarching	presence	in	the	world.	The Cold	War	was	still	hot.	Germany	was	still	divided.	And	there	was	still	a	Soviet Union,	which,	in	the	immortal	words	of	Ronald	Reagan,	was	regarded	as	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">“evil	empire.”	At	least	by	many	in	the	West. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	much	of	what	we	believed	back	then	was	truth	and	how	much	myth remains	in	question,	but	the	world	was	certainly	a	different	place	compared	with what	it	is	now—and	we,	I	suppose,	we’re	quite	different	people.	The	enemy,	too, is	a	different	breed	now,	and	far	more	elusive	than	the	monolith	of	Communism that	scared	the	bejeezus	out	of	so	many	of	us.	But	in	many	ways	the	game	played remains	the	same:	it’s	about	the	culture	of	fear,	of	societies	living	in	a	constant state	of	apprehension,	ever	awaiting	the	next	strike	from	an	enemy	who	lacks	all moral	probity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back	in	the	seventies	we	had	a	wall	between	us	and	them,	largely	built	upon	the foundation	of	mutually	assured	nuclear	annihilation.	Now	the	wall	is	different, and	it’s	built	more	upon	a	foundation	of	ever	evaporating	rights	and	freedoms that	has	given	the	enemy	the	sort	of	victory	over	us	for	which	we	were	once willing	to	risk	nuclear	war.	There	is	certainly	an	irony	to	be	found	in	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p3"></a>The	war	on	Communism	was	a	war	about	a	way	of	life;	but	the	war	on	terrorism has	become	more	about	life	itself.	We	now	find	ourselves	sacrificing	things	we were	once	willing	to	die	for	in	order	to	gain	a	sense	of	security.	But	at	what	point does	that	price	become	too	high?	At	what	point	do	we	become	the	very	image	of our	enemy? </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	a	way	I	think	The	Wall	applies	as	much	to	the	present	as	it	did	to	the	day when	it	was	written,	despite	the	changing	face	of	the	conflict	in	which	we	find ourselves	embroiled.	The	story	is	a	simple	metaphor	and	can	be	interpreted	as you	see	fit. </p>

<p class="calibre1">THE	WALL</p>
<p class="calibre1">By</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lindsay	Brambles</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sometimes,”	he	said,	squatting	down	by	the	fire	and	holding	his	hands	to	the open	flame,	“I	think	that	I	hear	voices	from	the	other	side.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Voices,	Sartas?”	someone	laughed.	“And	what	do	these	voices	say	to	you,	lad?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Were	they	women’s	voices?”	asked	another,	his	leering	face	looming	up	out	of the	darkness	and	into	the	sallow	glow	of	the	firelight.	“Perhaps	some	fair-haired temptress	willing	to	relieve	you	of	the	weighty	burden	of	your	virginity.”	More laughter,	lecherous	in	tone,	and	quickly	joined	by	a	chorus	of	rough	and	lustful glee,	which	in	the	closeness	of	the	dark	seemed	almost	feral	and	far	less	than mere	jest	and	honest	teasing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t	speak	as	to	whether	they	were	male	or	female,”	said	Sartas,	trying	hard to	keep	the	tremor	of	embarrassment	from	his	voice.	“But	it	did	sound	at	times</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p4"></a>like	laughter.	Of	the	sort	that	good	men	share	about	a	fire	and	over	a	meal.”	He assayed	a	grin	as	he	cast	his	gaze	over	his	colleagues. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	doubt	a	fiction	of	the	sun,”	offered	Tavarius	in	a	commiserating	tone.	He	sat across	from	the	young	guard,	idly	poking	at	food	on	the	beaten	metal	plate	that was	set	at	his	feet.	He	skewered	a	square	of	meat	with	the	tip	of	his	long	knife and	lifted	it	to	his	lips,	holding	it	poised	before	his	mouth	a	moment	before finally	clamping	square,	yellowed	teeth	about	it	and	pulling	it	free	with	a	jerk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	wasn’t	the	sun,”	Sartas	retorted	petulantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tavarius	shrugged,	then	wiped	a	trail	of	juice	from	his	chin	with	the	back	of	one hand	and	said,	“Be	careful,	lad.”	He	waggled	the	blade	of	his	knife	back	and forth	in	the	young	man’s	direction,	frowning	with	intense	sagacity.	“You’d	be wise	to	consider	spending	less	time	out	there	in	the	heat	of	day,	tramping	back and	forth	as	though	you	were	guarding	the	King’s	own	jewels.	All	that	sweating and	panting.	And	for	what?”	He	snorted	and	shook	his	head.	“Such	devotion may	well	be	admirable	in	some	quarters,	boy,	but	you’ll	curry	no	favor	here	with that	sort	of	attitude.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	it’s	why	we’re	here!”	Sartas	protested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	laughter	again	from	the	company	of	guards,	and	muted	chatter	that didn’t	carry	as	far	as	the	flame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	here	at	the	King’s	pleasure,”	said	Tavarius,	making	no	attempt	to disguise	his	contempt.	He	grunted	and	made	a	face.	“We’re	here	for	that	and because	the	citizens	of	Cysteria	don’t	believe	themselves	safe	from	a	myth.	They imagine	barbarian	hordes	waiting	on	the	other	side	of	yon	wall,	just	waiting	to pour	across	were	we	not	here	to	ensure	that	such	a	thing	doesn’t	occur.”	He leaned	back	on	his	haunches,	rested	his	elbows	on	his	knees	and	stared	listlessly into	the	fire.	“In	truth,”	he	concluded,	“we’re	nothing	more	than	a	sop	to	the unreasoned	fears	of	an	ignorant	people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sartas	frowned	and	regarded	the	old	guard	with	some	bafflement.	“You	talk	as though	you	don’t	believe,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Believe	what?”	Tavarius	demanded	scornfully.	“That	what	we	do	here	has	any meaning?”	He	gestured	broadly,	theatrically,	a	certain	degree	of	anger	and impatience	in	the	sweep	of	his	arm.	“What	meaning	is	there	to	marching	six	days</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p5"></a>across	the	dry	and	choking	dust	of	the	desert	to	walk	the	ramparts	of	a	wall whose	purpose	scholars	have	debated	for	centuries?”	he	continued.	“What purpose	is	there	in	spending	six	months	out	here,	in	the	middle	of	nowhere,	away from	our	families,	from	the	warm	beds	of	our	wives	and	the	laughing	faces	of our	children	because	our	king	chooses	to	subscribe	to	myth	and	legend?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	father	was	a	guard	on	the	Wall,”	said	Sartas	with	much	hubris,	as	though that	somehow	spoke	to	all	these	issues	raised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Tavarius	merely	nodded	and	said,	“As	was	mine.	As	were	the	fathers	of	all who	are	accorded	the	‘honor’	of	being	guardians	of	the	Wall.	You	wouldn’t	be here	if	your	father	hadn’t	once	walked	the	wall.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	you	don’t	think	it	an	honor?”	said	Sartas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Once,”	the	old	guard	lamented,	“I	dreamed	with	boyish	exuberance	of	the	day when	I	would	take	my	place	as	one	of	the	guardians	of	the	Wall,	when	I	would serve	as	my	father	had	served,	and	as	his	father	before	him.	In	the	cities	they revere	the	guardians	of	the	Wall,	and	think	it	a	great	sacrifice	that	men	would risk	themselves	as	first	line	in	the	defense	of	the	realm.	And	once,	when	I	was young,	I	took	pride	in	their	admiration.	I	thought	I	deserved	it.	I	thought	I	had earned	it.	But	one	can	only	stomach	so	much	undeserved	praise,	until,	like	milk soured	by	the	summer	storm,	it	begins	to	have	a	bitter,	unpalatable	taste.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	father	was	never	ashamed	of	what	he	did,”	Sartas	proclaimed	loftily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	not,”	Tavarius	agreed.	“But	he’d	be	rare	among	those	who	have	walked this	wall	if	he	hadn’t	felt	some	dissatisfaction	for	having	wasted	a	good	part	of his	life	waiting	for	ghosts	to	arise	and	threaten	the	great	lands	of	Cysteria.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	notions	are	all	well	and	good,”	said	Sartas,	“but	surely	they	ignore	the	fact of	the	Wall	itself.	If	there’s	no	threat,	Tavarius,	then	what	purpose	has	the	Wall? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Surely	it	wasn’t	built	simply	to	exist.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	can	you	say	that	it	wasn’t?”	the	old	man	challenged.	“Perhaps,	indeed,	it was.	But	if	there	was	a	purpose,	then	it’s	long	forgotten;	and	it	might	well	be other	than	what	myth	and	legend	have	assigned	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Clearly	it’s	here	to	protect	us,”	Sartas	said	with	conviction;	but	Tavarius	merely stared	across	the	open	flames	at	him	and	slowly	shook	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p6"></a>“Clearly,	eh?	There’s	nothing	clear	about	it,	boy.	In	time	you’ll	become disabused	of	such	fancy,”	the	old	guard	assured	him.	“The	Wall	is	here	as	might be	a	mountain	or	a	river.	Who	are	we,	that	we	might	so	arrogantly	presume	to understand	the	intentions	of	its	builders?	Perhaps	they	intended	nothing	more than	to	separate	the	here	from	the	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	ridiculous!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	it	now?	And	what	purpose	has	the	moon,	which	in	its	cycles	vanishes	from the	sky	to	leave	darkness	cut	only	by	the	flames	of	a	fire	and	the	feeble	glow	of the	myriad	stars?	And	is	such	a	notion	any	more	unreasoned	than	the	whims	of	a king	who	would	have	us	trek	through	the	heat	of	desert	sands	to	walk	these lonely	ramparts,	marching	mindlessly	back	and	forth,	waiting	for	the	attack	of	an enemy	we’ve	neither	seen	nor	heard	in	all	the	many	years	the	guard	have walked?”	Tavarius	snorted	loudly	and	kicked	aside	his	plate	in	disgust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Centuries,	lad,”	his	voice	boomed.	“For	thousands	of	years	this	wall	has	stood beneath	sun	and	sky,	watching	the	turn	of	the	years,	unscarred	by	wind	and	sand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Countless	kings	have	come	and	gone.	Ten	times	a	thousand	men	have	tread	upon its	stone.	And	ten	times	a	thousand	have	gone	to	their	graves,	wondering	what	it was	they	were	doing	when	they	stood	here	and	wielded	shield	and	spear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Think	of	it,	Sartas:	thousands	of	years;	and	in	that	time	men	like	you	and	I	have been	engaged	in	a	war	of	nerves	with	an	enemy	no	more	substantial	than	the ether	of	spirits.	Ghosts.	It’s	no	small	wonder	the	King	pays	good	coin	for	those who	would	venture	so	far	from	home	for	such	foolishness,	because	he	couldn’t keep	a	man	doing	it	again	and	again,	year	after	year	if	the	money	weren’t	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	need	money	to	persuade	me	of	the	value	of	defending	our	lands	and	our people,”	Sartas	said	boldly	as	he	jumped	to	his	feet	and	stood	towering	above	the scattered	company	of	guards.	“Perhaps	it’s	you	have	been	too	long	for	the	sun, Tavarius.”	And	with	that	he	turned	and	stalked	off	along	the	broad	ledge	that	ran the	length	of	the	Wall,	quickly	swallowed	by	the	darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	all	the	same,”	said	Karn	as	he	settled	down	beside	Tavarius.	“Bursting with	the	pride	of	being	the	first	born	of	a	guardian	and	becoming	one themselves.	Full	of	the	misguided	idealism	of	youth.”	He	hawked	and	spat	into the	fire,	the	gob	of	spittle	making	a	brief	hiss	against	the	hot	embers.	“They’re	so sure	of	themselves.	They	think	they	know	everything	before	they’ve	had	time	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a>learn	anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tavarius	grinned.	“As	did	we,	when	we	first	came	to	serve	upon	this	stone,”	he reminded	his	friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karn	laughed	ruefully.	“It	seems	so	long	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was,	my	friend.	We’re	old;	and	perhaps	our	impatience	with	the	likes	of Sartas	is	merely	resentment	of	his	youth	and	all	the	many	years	that	he	has before	him.	The	years	in	which	he’ll	learn	the	mistakes	we’ve	now	forgotten.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye.	We’ve	grown	old	together	on	this	blighted	rock,	you	and	I,”	Karn observed.	He	scratched	his	beard	and	sniffed	loudly.	“But	he’ll	not	be	long	for this	cursed	place	if	someone	doesn’t	knock	some	sense	into	that	thick	skull	of his.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tavarius	gave	his	friend	a	sober	look,	then	smiled	thinly.	He	turned	and	looked out	through	the	darkness	that	Sartas	had	disappeared	into	and	said,	“The	Wall will	soon	break	his	spirit,	my	friend.	It	always	does.	And	when	it	has	done	with him,	he’ll	come	back	to	the	fires	and	we’ll	all	talk	and	drink	and	dream	of	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	did	our	fathers,	and	their	fathers	before	them,	since	the	first	days	men	walked upon	these	cursed	stones.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	if	he	doesn’t	come	back?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	he’ll	live	lonely	with	his	voices.” </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre3">******</p>
It	had	been	a	week,	and	Tavarius	had	watched	Sartas,	unbroken,	dutifully striding	the	Wall,	spear	and	shield	in	hand,	armor	always	polished	bright	enough for	royal	inspection.	A	week	of	such	scorching	temperatures	that	the	seasoned members	of	the	guard	no	longer	camped	on	the	hot	gray-black	stone	of	the Wall’s	wide	ledge,	but	sat,	instead,	sprawled	in	the	shade	of	their	open-aired tents,	sleeping	and	drinking	and	doing	little	else.	They	seldom	ventured	forth onto	the	searing	desert	sands,	except	to	fetch	water	from	one	of	the	deep	wells; and	their	duties	to	the	King	had	been	consigned	to	the	occasional	foray	up	onto the	Wall,	where	they	took	much	delight	in	deriding	and	teasing	the	handful	of new	recruits.	The	latter,	like	Sartas,	still	took	seriously	the	task	of	protecting	the lands	of	Cysteria.	The	veterans	would	laugh	and	jeer,	mocking	their	younger<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>colleagues,	and	proclaiming	loudly	that	only	fools	would	wear	such	hot	and heavy	armor	and	bear	the	stifling	heat	of	the	Wall’s	burning	stone	to	guard against	the	unknown,	the	unseen,	and	the	unlikely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	a	stubborn	one,	that	one,”	said	Karn,	gesturing	with	his	goblet	of	watered wine.	He	glanced	over	at	Tavarius,	who	sat	at	the	edge	of	the	shade	cast	by	their tent,	staring	up	at	the	Wall	and	the	tiny	figures	of	the	few	foolhardy	young	men who	walked	there.	They	moved	purposefully	back	and	forth,	strutting	in	a precise	manner,	as	though	on	parade,	each	one	covering	a	few	dozen	meters	of the	ledge	that	jutted	out	from	the	sheer	face	of	smooth	stone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	Sartas,	though,	who	was	clearly	the	most	committed.	The	others	would occasionally	falter,	pausing	every	now	and	then	to	look	down	onto	the	desert where	the	company’s	tents	lay	pitched.	Through	his	spyglass	Tavarius	could	see their	faces,	and	the	longing	in	their	eyes,	and	knew	they	weren’t	long	for	the Wall.	Soon	they’d	give	in	to	the	seductive	shade	of	the	tents,	enticed	by prospects	of	a	respite	from	the	oven	heat	of	the	Wall.	But	in	Sartas	there	was	no such	yearning.	He	remained	stoic,	marching	endlessly	back	and	forth	over	his small	section	of	the	Wall,	stamping	his	feet	loud	and	strong	at	each	turn,	and ignoring	the	sweat	that	rolled	down	from	beneath	his	tight	metal	helm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	makes	me	hot	and	tired	just	looking	at	him,”	Karn	complained.	He	drank deeply	of	his	wine,	then	thumped	his	chest	to	elicit	a	noisy	belch.	“There	should be	a	law	against	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	does	the	King’s	bidding,	my	friend,”	Tavarius	chortled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	are	we	not	doing	the	King’s	bidding?”	Karn	demanded	with	mock indignation.	“Do	we	not	suffer	this	wretched	watered	wine,	and	the	grit	of	sand in	our	food	for	the	whim	of	a	king?	Do	we	not	endure	this	unbearable	heat simply	to	assuage	the	fears	of	the	public?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	the	coin	and	the	honor,”	Tavarius	reminded	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	yes!	Such	honor.	And	the	coin!”	Karn	snorted	and	made	a	face.	“One	gold sovereign	at	the	end	of	six	months.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Better	pay	than	any	ship	hand	or	common	sentry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	a	ship	hand	has	a	regular	port,	and	the	sentry	returns	home	each	day	to	wife</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>and	hot	food.	No	watered	wines	for	him.	No	sand	filled	stew	for	his	delicate palate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Think	of	the	prestige,”	Tavarius	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karn’s	face	brightened.	“There’s	that,”	he	agreed.	“Many’s	the	time	I’ve	lifted	a free	pint	of	the	ale	in	the	taverns.	And	it’s	certain	that	a	walker	of	the	Wall	can have	his	choice	of	women	to	warm	his	bed,	should	he	so	fancy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which	is	no	doubt	why	I	see	your	ugly	face	out	here	year	after	year,”	Tavarius grumped	good-naturedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	it	ain’t	the	scenery.”	Karn	looked	out	towards	the	Wall.	“The	Gods	only know	that	I	tire	of	seeing	that	cursed	blight	of	stone.	I	grow	weary	of	wondering what’s	beyond,	and	why	it	is	that	we	sit	here	waiting	for	something	that	may never	come.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	there	are	others	on	the	other	side	wondering	much	the	same,”	Tavarius suggested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	think	so?”	Karn	looked	doubtful.	He	scratched	his	beard	and	studied	the Wall	with	a	shrewd	eye.	“I	wonder	that	no	one	has	ever	tried	going	over,”	he mused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	you	know	as	well	as	I	that	none	would	dare	tempt	the	fates.	Legend and	myth	forbid	it.	Those	who	would	hazard	to	cross	the	wall	shall	bring	down upon	the	lands	of	Cysteria	the	wrath	of	the	Gods,”	Tavarius	pronounced,	without a	great	deal	of	conviction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whatever	that	might	be,”	Karn	muttered	irreverently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	fear	the	Wall	has	made	you	cynical	and	rebellious,	my	friend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	wall	has	made	me	something,”	Karn	growled	in	a	surly	manner.	“But	it’s the	King	who	sends	me	here	to	spend	six	months	without	good	food	or	drink	or women.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	the	King,	and	he	can	do	as	he	sees	fit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	were	he	to	spend	a	tour	of	duty	out	here	he’d	change	his	view	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>things.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	our	place	to	judge	the	likes	of	the	King,”	Tavarius	said	sarcastically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course,”	Karn	agreed,	rolling	his	eyes.	“And	heaven	forbid	that	he	should ever	be	wrong.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“His	word	is	god,	so	long	as	he	sits	upon	the	throne.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps,	then,	it’s	time	for	someone	else	to	sit	upon	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tavarius	feigned	shock.	“Such	blasphemy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“None	that	you	haven’t	heard	before.”	Karn	poured	himself	more	wine.	“And none	you	won’t	hear	again,	I	venture.”	He	lifted	his	goblet	and	pointed	with	it	to the	Wall.	“They’ll	soon	weary	of	this	nonsense	and	join	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps,”	said	Tavarius.	He	raised	his	spyglass	to	his	eye	again	and	peered towards	the	Wall.	He	knew	it	so	well	after	all	these	years	—	each	inch	of	its perfection.	And	yet,	he	didn’t	really	know	it	at	all;	for	it	remained	as	much	a mystery	to	him	now	as	it	had	when	he’d	been	the	age	of	Sartas.	No	doubt	it would	remain	thus,	until	he	no	longer	walked	the	Wall. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre3">******</p>
By	the	second	week	the	first	of	the	new	recruits	had	abandoned	principle	for	the comfort	of	the	shade.	He	was	greeted	in	the	camp	with	much	cheer	from	the veterans,	who	plied	him	with	wine	and	food,	and	treated	him	as	though	he	were a	hero.	Tavarius	watched	all	this	with	amusement,	as	he	had	time	and	time before.	But	when	he	looked	up	to	the	Wall	he	saw	Sartas	there,	marching	back and	forth,	ramrod	straight,	and	showing	all	the	discipline	that	would	have	made him	a	favorite	of	the	King’s.	Tavarius	didn’t	know	why,	but	it	unsettled	him	to see	this.	He	didn’t	want	to	admit	that	it	was	guilt,	but	there	was	a	nagging	sense in	the	back	of	his	mind	that	it	was. <p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Others	quickly	followed	the	first,	and	by	the	beginning	of	the	third	week	there was	but	one	lonely	soul	walking	the	Wall.	One	man	to	stand	between	the unknown,	the	unseen,	and	the	unlikely.	One	man	protecting	all	of	Cysteria	from whatever	evils	might	await	beyond	that	towering	barrier. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>“A	fool,”	Tavarius	sighed	as	he	lowered	his	spyglass	and	sat	back	in	the	cool shade.	But	there	wasn’t	as	much	conviction	in	his	voice	as	usual;	and	in	his	dark eyes	and	sun-lined	face	there	were	signs	of	grudging	respect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karn	chuckled	softly.	“Reminds	me	of	you,	when	you	first	came	to	the	Wall.	You were	eager	then,	Tav.	So	full	of	enthusiasm,	so	determined	that	you’d	serve	your king	well.	You	believed	then.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	many	things,”	Tavarius	agreed	quietly.	“But	I	was	young	and	naive.	And	I wasn’t	long	for	the	Wall.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	all	the	same,”	Karn	observed.	“Back	home	they	make	us	believe	it’s	such a	great	honor.	They	make	us	believe	there’s	purpose	in	what’s	done	out	here	in the	eternal	loneliness	of	this	forsaken	desert.”	He	shook	his	head.	“Had	I	known back	then	what	I	know	now,	I’d	have	never	accepted	the	‘honor’	of	being	one	of the	walkers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tavarius	laughed.	“You	make	it	sound	as	though	you	were	betrayed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	wasn’t	I?”	Karn	slapped	a	hand	against	the	sand.	“Didn’t	I	hear	the guardians	of	the	Wall	spin	their	tales	of	wonder	as	they	sat	drinking	in	the taverns?	Didn’t	I	listen	at	the	door	as	my	father	regaled	all	with	stories	of	great daring?	And	didn’t	he	leave	me	in	awe	of	him	after	relating	some	great adventure	that	took	place	here?”	He	grabbed	a	fistful	of	sand	and	flung	it	angrily into	the	air.	“Here,	Tav!	Here,	in	this	hell	of	dust	and	boredom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	father,	too,	told	such	tales,”	Tavarius	confessed.	“And	no	doubt	his	father before	him	did	the	same.	And	I,	when	I’m	at	home	with	wife	and	children,	am given	to	some	embellishment	when	relating	the	months	spent	whiling	away	the time	in	this	desert.	Perhaps	I’m	just	ashamed	to	admit	there’s	no	threat.	Perhaps, when	I	see	the	wonder	in	their	eyes	and	the	glowing	admiration,	I	can’t	help myself.	And	though	I	tell	myself	time	and	time	again	that	it’s	wrong	and	that	I must	end	the	lies,	I	can’t.	Because	somehow	I	feel	that	I’d	be	betraying	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Betraying	their	belief	in	me	as	husband	and	father.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karn	nodded	sympathetically.	“It’s	the	truth,”	he	sighed.	“For	it’s	no	different	for me.	It’s	too	easy	to	accept	the	accolades,	even	as	the	guilt	gnaws	at	my conscience	and	I	find	myself	wishing	desperately	to	tell	them	all	the	truth.	But sometimes,	when	I	see	my	son	look	to	me	with	such	admiration,	I	want	to	cry.	I want	so	desperately	to	tell	him	the	truth,	because	one	day	he’ll	know	it	for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>himself.	And	then,	Tav,	what	will	he	think	of	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	as	you	think	of	your	father.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With	anger	at	first.	And	then	pity.	And	understanding.	More	so	as	the	years pass.	I	am	he,	in	ways	that	I	could	never	have	imagined.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	are	we	all.”	Tavarius	raised	his	spyglass	to	his	eye	and	peered	at	the	Wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	him?”	asked	Karn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sartas,	too,	wishes	only	to	be	like	his	father.	And	because	he	can’t	yet	accept the	truth	of	it,	he	stands	up	there,	vigilant	against	the	embroidered	myths	that have	led	a	succession	of	kings	to	send	good	men	north	and	south	to	waste	in	the heat	of	a	merciless	desert	sun.”	Tavarius	lowered	the	glass	and	was	silent	for	a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	difficult	to	accept	the	humanity	of	one’s	idols,”	he	said	at	length.	“In	our early	years	as	sons	we	look	upon	our	fathers	as	gods.	They	can	do	no	wrong; they’re	always	right.	Until	we	grow	old	enough	to	see	their	feet	of	clay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,”	said	Karn,	nodding	his	head.	“Sartas	doesn’t	walk	the	Wall	for	the	King, then.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	He	walks	the	Wall	because	he	doesn’t	wish	to	see	his	father’s	feet	of	the clay.” </p><p class="calibre1">

It	had	been	a	month,	now.	A	month	of	searing	heat	and	the	ceaseless	monotony of	days	spent	camped	out	in	the	shade,	with	little	to	occupy	the	minds	of	the guard	save	the	perpetual	cycle	of	gaming	and	the	downing	of	liberal	quantities	of libation.	Occasionally	a	fight	would	break	out	and	the	men	would	gather	about the	two	combatants	and	cheer	them	on.	But	such	confrontations	seldom	required the	intervention	of	the	officers,	because	they	usually	ended	a	few	blows	after they	had	started	Indeed,	there	was	little	energy	for	much	more	than	this;	and nobody	wanted	to	risk	six	months	wages	because	of	some	meaningless	dispute. <p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Tavarius	had	seen	it	all	time	and	time	before.	And	like	the	Wall	and	the	desert, he’d	grown	rather	tired	of	it.	He	could	well	understand	the	few	who	reached	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>point	where	they	could	bear	it	no	more.	On	every	tour	there	was	at	least	one	such individual.	Men	who	would	go	racing	to	the	Wall	and	try	to	scale	the	unscalable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	would	fall	to	their	deaths;	others	would	fall	upon	their	swords. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	in	all	his	years	of	service,	Tavarius	had	never	seen	anything	like	Sartas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	inhuman,”	Karn	growled,	eyes	flashing	with	indignation.	He	stood	outside their	tent	in	the	early	morning	hours,	shielding	his	eyes	with	an	upraised	had	as he	looked	towards	the	Wall.	“A	month	he’s	been	there.	He’s	like	an	infernal machine.	Back	and	forth.	Back	and	forth.	Never	faltering,	even	in	the	worst	of the	sun.	He’s	driving	me	to	drink,	I	tell	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	wouldn’t	take	much	to	do	that,”	said	Tavarius. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karn	ignored	this	remark	and	said,	“Just	look	at	him.	It	ain’t	human.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wager	there’s	never	been	his	like	before,”	Tavarius	agreed.	“The	King	would be	proud	of	that	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karn	grunted	noisily.	“He’s	as	mad	as	those	idiots	who	try	to	climb	the	bloody thing,”	he	stated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or	perhaps	just	dedicated.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	there	a	difference?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	forget	our	youth,	my	friend.	Once	we,	too,	were	dedicated	enough	to	stand long	hours	on	that	Wall.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	never	so	long	as	this!”	Karn	exclaimed.	“We	soon	enough	saw	the	truth	and came	to	our	senses.	But	him—”	He	sniffed	disapprovingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	doesn’t	make	for	insanity.	Perhaps	just	for	a	man	with	deeper	convictions than	we	ever	had.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Such	convictions	will	as	like	get	him	killed,”	Karn	muttered.	“He	takes	his	food and	water	from	line	and	bucket,	despite	our	constant	entreaties	that	he	come down.	He	hasn’t	spoken	to	a	soul	since	the	last	of	the	new	recruits	came	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	last	save	himself,	that	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>Tavarius	drew	a	breath,	let	it	out	in	a	long	sigh.	“If	he	won’t	come	down,	then perhaps	it	behooves	one	of	us	to	go	up	there	and	talk	to	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Any	volunteers?”	Karn	chortled.	“There’s	not	likely	a	man	in	this	camp	who cares	what	happens	to	him,	Tav.	‘Cepting	maybe	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tavarius	shrugged.	“Then	it	must	be	me,”	he	said,	forcing	a	grin. </p><p class="calibre1">

Because	there’d	never	been	a	desire	to	give	potential	assailants	an	easy	route over	the	Wall	to	Cysterian	lands,	there	had	never	been	any	stairs	made	to	the ledge.	In	the	same	manner	that	food	and	water	were	hoisted	by	rope	and	pulley to	the	ledge	far	above	the	desert	plain,	Tavarius	was	hauled	upwards	to	his meeting	with	Sartas.	And	although	it	was	a	trip	he’d	made	many	times	in	his	life, he	found	himself	somewhat	apprehensive	this	time	as	the	thick	line	ran	through the	block	with	much	creaking	and	squeaking,	and	the	smooth	wall	slipped	by	in fits	and	starts	as	the	men	below	hauled	the	rope	in,	hand	over	hand. <p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">At	length	he	reached	the	wood	derrick	that	leaned	out	from	the	ledge	and	swung himself	inwards,	alighting	with	practiced	ease	on	the	stone.	He	was	a	good kilometer	from	where	Sartas	maintained	his	vigil,	so	he	started	off	at	an	easy pace,	not	especially	eager	for	this	encounter.	As	he	walked	he	kept	going	over	in his	mind	the	things	he	would	say,	but	he	knew	that	once	he	was	there	he’d probably	forget	them	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	found	Sartas	seated	near	a	fire,	nursing	a	cup	of	hot	cha	as	he	stared resolutely	out	across	the	desert.	The	sun	was	low	in	the	west,	so	the	shadows	of everything	down	on	the	plain	were	long	and	thin	daggers	of	black	pointed towards	the	heart	of	the	east.	The	scattered	clouds	flamed	with	color	near	the sun,	but	were	a	steely	gray	on	the	opposite	horizon.	In	the	spaces	between	them a	few	stars	shone,	the	harbingers	of	the	thousands	that	would	later	fill	the	night like	the	lights	of	a	city	seen	from	afar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tavarius	squatted	down	by	the	fire,	across	from	Sartas,	the	steaming	pot	of	cha between	them.	“Mind?”	he	asked,	indicating	the	pot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	all	brothers	here,”	Sartas	replied	evenly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tavarius	took	a	metal	cup	from	his	belt	and	held	it	towards	the	pot.	He	used	his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>knife	to	tilt	the	pot,	letting	the	hot	brew	slosh	into	his	cup.	“A	beautiful	evening,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	remarked	casually	as	he	brought	the	cha	to	his	lips	and	blew	on	it.	The	steam bent	and	fluttered	under	the	impetus	of	his	breath,	then	rose	straight	again	in	the windless	air.	He	could	feel	the	heat	of	it	against	his	face;	and	he	wondered	what he	was	doing	sitting	up	here	drinking	hot	cha	in	the	sweltering	heat	of	the	desert when	he	should	have	been	down	there	enjoying	wine	and	the	companionship	of his	fellow	guards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	think	me	a	fool,”	said	Sartas	abruptly.	He	didn’t	lift	his	gaze	as	he	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	Tavarius	agreed.	He	glanced	at	the	younger	man,	an	apologetic	look	in	his eye.	“They	don’t	understand	why	you	remain	up	here,	when	it’s	so	obvious there’s	no	threat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	it	so	obvious,	Tavarius?”	Now	Sartas	turned	and	stared	at	the	old	guard.	“Is what	we	do	here	really	so	empty	of	meaning?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tavarius	considered	this	for	a	moment.	“The	Wall	has	stood	for	longer	than recorded	time,”	he	said	at	length.	“In	all	those	centuries	there	has	never	been	one reported	case	of	attack.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	you	believe	the	threat	for	which	it	was	built	no	longer	exists?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	there	was	never	a	threat	to	begin	with,	lad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sartas	snorted	dismissively.	“You	talk	nonsense,”	he	growled.	“What	king	would order	the	construction	of	such	a	thing	if	it	were	to	serve	no	purpose?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	never	said	it	was	built	for	no	reason.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Walls	are	meant	to	keep	things	out,”	Sartas	pronounced	with	finality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or	keep	things	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cysteria	is	not	a	prison!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	not	now—though	there	are	many	definitions	of	prison.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sartas	shook	his	head	vigorously.	“The	Wall	is	here	to	protect,	as	are	we.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>“I	agree	the	Wall	is	here	to	protect,”	said	Tavarius	soberly.	“But	to	protect	what? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	people?	The	land?	Or	perhaps	the	King	and	his	minions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some	would	brand	your	words	as	treason,”	Sartas	said	with	a	frown	of reproach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	lived	in	fear	for	centuries,”	Tavarius	observed.	“Centuries	of	rule	by kings,	who	have	preyed	on	that	fear	to	maintain	control	of	the	land	and	its people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	believe	it,”	Sartas	said,	a	dark	scowl	across	his	face.	“The	Wall	was	built to	protect	us	from	a	great	evil.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which	never	came.	Which	never	has,	lad.	And	we’ve	walked	this	stone	for centuries	in	anticipation.	Perhaps	the	only	evil	was	the	evil	of	anarchy.	Perhaps the	Wall	brought	order	where	none	had	been	before.	Perhaps	the	Wall,	merely	in its	existence,	brought	purpose.	It	made	people	believe	in	the	need	for	kings	and armies	at	a	time	when	they	needed	to.	And	now	they	can’t	stop	believing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	if	you’re	wrong,	Tavarius?	What	if	there’s	an	army	awaiting	beyond,	even as	we	speak?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	will	a	wall	and	a	handful	of	guards	really	stop	them,	Sartas?”	Tavarius chuckled	softly	and	shook	his	head.	“We’re	here	to	maintain	the	illusion.	The King	is	strong	so	long	as	there	is	a	perceived	threat	and	he	is	seen	to	be	doing something	about	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	what	of	the	voices?”	Sartas	grinned	triumphantly,	believing	that	he’d	won a	point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	all	heard	them	at	one	time	or	another,”	Tavarius	admitted.	“But	they could	as	like	be	the	wind	as	not.	The	conversations	of	other	guardians	carried from	other	outposts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	weren’t	the	wind!”	Sartas	declared.	“And	they	weren’t	the	Sun,”	he added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tavarius	stared	at	him	pityingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	too	cynical	and	distrusting,”	Sartas	insisted,	simmering	with	rage. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>“Age	will	do	that	to	a	man,”	said	Tavarius.	“Age	and	the	Wall.	But	I	don’t actively	seek	to	be	these	things.	I	know	only	that	I’ve	walked	these	walls	for years,	as	did	my	father,	and	his	father,	and	his	father’s	father,	down	through	the centuries,	to	ancestors	whose	names	I	don’t	even	know.	I	would	wish	my	son	a better	fate	than	this.”	He	threw	the	last	of	his	cha	into	the	fire	with	an	angry motion	of	disdain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	must	be	vigilant,”	Sartas	insisted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	we	must.	But	not	here,	lad.	Not	on	this	wall.	We	must	be	vigilant	against those	who	would	use	us,	who	would	play	us	like	puppets	on	strings, manipulating	us	for	their	own	ends.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you	believe	these	things	you	say,	then	why	do	you	come?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	I	have	family,	lad.	A	wife	and	children	who	must	be	cared	for.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	coin,	then.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	coin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	have	no	doubts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tavarius	grinned	wanly.	“There	are	always	doubts,”	he	said.	“As	I	said:	I,	too, have	heard	the	voices.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sartas	blinked.	“You	hear	the	evidence,”	he	said,	“and	yet	still	you	claim	there’s no	threat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	only	voices,	lad.”	Tavarius	sighed	and	shook	his	head.	“But	as	like	as not	they’re	the	imaginings	of	lonely	men.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or	armies	massing	to	launch	an	assault.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	waiting	so	long	to	do	it?”	Tavarius	scoffed.	He	chuckled	dryly,	mocking this	notion.	“I	first	heard	them	more	than	twenty	years	ago,	Sartas.	And	before that,	my	father	had	heard	them.	And	his	father.	Men	have	stood	on	this	stone	and heard	them	for	as	long	as	I’ve	known.	No	army	would	wait	centuries	to	launch an	assault.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>“They’re	not	the	wind,”	Sartas	insisted	angrily.	“And	they’re	not	the	imaginings of	a	lonely	man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	dark	now,	and	Tavarius	stared	into	the	fire,	his	face	illumined	by	the yellow-orange	flames,	eyes	deep	with	shadows.	“Your	words	may	well	be	true, young	Sartas,”	he	said	gently.	“Perhaps	no	wind	speaks	thus;	and	I’ll	admit	the imaginings	of	the	lonely	man	tend	to	the	pleasures	of	the	flesh	more	often	than not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	tell	me	what	it	is	we’ve	hear,”	said	Sartas	eagerly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tavarius	turned	about	and	looked	towards	the	Wall.	He	stared	at	it,	then	lifted	his gaze	to	the	summit	that	seemed	to	merge	with	the	sky.	Only	the	stars distinguished	stone	from	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps,”	he	said,	“those	voices	belong	to	the	mirror	of	ourselves.	Perhaps beyond	that	wall	there	are	other	men	like	us,	doing	the	bidding	of	their	king.	Old men,	like	myself,	who	come	for	coin;	and	young	men,	like	you,	Sartas,”	—and he	glanced	at	the	younger	guard—	“who	come	out	of	some	misguided	sense	of duty,	honestly	believing	in	the	task	they’ve	been	assigned.	Perhaps	these reflections	of	ourselves	also	drink	watered	wine	and	wallow	half	drunk	in	the cool	shade	of	tents,	whiling	away	the	six	months	of	an	onerous	tour.	Perhaps they,	too,	have	wives	and	children	and	homes	they	long	for	in	their	daily	dreams. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	possible	they	even	sit	about	fires,	as	we	do,	pondering	voices	they’ve	heard and	the	senselessness	of	this	wall	that	divides	the	here	from	the	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	what	you	say	is	true,	wouldn’t	they	have	ventured	over	to	see	the	truth?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tavarius	favored	him	with	an	amused	look.	“Have	we?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	it’s	time	we	did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	is	for	our	King	and	the	people	to	decide,”	said	Tavarius	more	seriously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	all	that	you’ve	said—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	come	for	coin,	Sartas.	I	come	because	of	a	wife	and	children	whom	I	wish	to see	enjoy	life	as	life	should	be	enjoyed.	It	isn’t	my	place	to	answer	the	questions scholars	have	pondered	for	years	and	for	which	kings	have	had	neither	the courage	nor	the	inclination	to	resolve	for	centuries.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>“Aren’t	you	even	curious	to	know	the	truth?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	truth?”	Tavarius	laughed.	“Does	it	matter	what	the	truth	is?	Would	any believe	us	if	they	knew	it?”	He	shook	his	head.	“No,	it	serves	the	purposes	of	all that	things	remain	as	they	are.	The	King	maintains	control	of	the	realm.	The citizens	remain	at	peace,	knowing	they’re	protected	against	the	evil	that	is beyond.	And	we,	who	have	walked	this	stone	for	as	long	as	recorded	time,	get our	coin	and	our	glory,	however	undeserved.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	what	about	them?”	Sartas	demanded,	pointing	down	to	the	camp.	“I’ve heard	them,	grumbling	and	complaining	and	wanting	nothing	more	than	to	be done	with	this.	And	you	yourself	have	said	that	few	if	any	believe	and	take	pride in	what	they	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	we	do	it,	Sartas.	And	for	all	our	words,	we’ll	continue	to	do	it.	Because	it’s what	we	do.	It’s	the	purpose	in	our	lives,	however	much	we	may	wish	it otherwise.	Without	the	Wall	what	would	we	be?	We	were	raised	for	this.	From the	time	we	were	but	boys	barely	able	to	carry	a	spear	we’ve	constructed	our lives	to	serve	this	one	thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	without	the	Wall	we’re	nothing,”	whispered	Sartas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tavarius	nodded,	grim-faced.	“And	they	all	know	it	too,	in	their	hearts,”	he	said, gesturing	towards	the	camp.	“Our	world	wouldn’t	be	the	same	without	the	Wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	has	made	Cysteria	what	it	is	today.	Perhaps	that’s	what	it’s	builders	intended.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	it’s	as	simple	as	all	that,”	said	Sartas,	lifting	his	arms	wide	in	frustration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Need	it	be	more	complicated?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	there’ll	never	be	an	end	to	it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tavarius	smiled	and	pushed	himself	erect,	until	he	was	standing	looking	down upon	the	young	guard.	“In	the	entire	world	I	know	of	but	two	certainties,	lad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	is	death.	The	other	is	the	Wall.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	given	me	much	to	think	about,”	said	Sartas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	old	guard	nodded.	“I	leave	now,”	he	said;	and	he	turned	and	went	the	way he’d	come,	guided	only	by	the	feeble	starlight	and	the	many	years	of	walking	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>Wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sartas	watched	him	go	with	a	look	of	longing. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre3">******</p>
The	next	day	Sartas	came	down	from	the	Wall.	He	was	greeted	with	much	cheer and	plied	with	wine	and	food.	Tavarius	watched	all	this	from	afar,	grimacing with	regret. <p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“You	look	as	though	you’ve	lost	something,”	said	Karn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tavarius	regarded	his	friend	ruefully.	“Perhaps	I	have,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	should	be	joyous,”	insisted	Karn.	He	clapped	his	friend	heartily	on	the back.	“You’ve	saved	the	boy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have	I?”	Tavarius	stared	up	at	the	Wall.	“He	was	like	no	other,	Karn.	Now	he’s simply	one	of	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	see	him	complaining.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Tavarius	wasn’t	listening.	He	was	gathering	shield	and	spear	and	packing provisions.	When	he	was	done	he	started	out	the	tent,	striding	with	a determination	he	hadn’t	felt	in	years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	are	you	going?”	asked	Karn,	confused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To	walk	the	Wall,”	Tavarius	called	back.	“To	listen	to	voices	that	have	no	faces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	to	guard	against	our	greatest	enemy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our	greatest	enemy?	What’s	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Apathy,	my	friend.	Apathy.” </p>
