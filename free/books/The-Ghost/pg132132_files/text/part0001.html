<h3 id="pgepubid00017" class="calibre3">ROSA'S SUMMONS</h3>
<p class="calibre4">Everyone knows the Gold Rooms at the Grand Babylon on the Embankment. They are immense, splendid, and gorgeous; they possess more gold leaf to the square inch than any music-hall in London. They were designed to throw the best possible light on humanity in the mass, to illuminate effectively not only the shoulders of women, but also the sombreness of men's attire. Not a tint on their walls that has not been profoundly studied and mixed and laid with a view to the great aim. Wherefore, when the electric clusters glow in the ceiling, and the "after-dinner" band (that unique corporation of British citizens disguised as wild Hungarians) breathes and pants out its after-dinner melodies from the raised platform in the main salon, people regard this coup d'oeil with awe, and feel glad that they are in the dazzling picture, and even the failures who are there <a id="Page_54" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[54]"></a>imagine that they have succeeded. Wherefore, also, the Gold Rooms of the Grand Babylon are expensive, and only philanthropic societies, plutocrats, and the Titans of the theatrical world may persuade themselves that they can afford to engage them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was very late when I arrived at my cousin Sullivan's much advertised reception. I had wished not to go at all, simply because I was inexperienced and nervous; but both he and his wife were so good-natured and so obviously anxious to be friendly, that I felt bound to appear, if only for a short time. As I stood in the first room, looking vaguely about me at the lively throng of resplendent actresses who chattered and smiled so industriously and with such abundance of gesture to the male acquaintances who surrounded them, I said to myself that I was singularly out of place there.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I didn't know a soul, and the stream of arrivals having ceased, neither Sullivan nor Emmeline was immediately visible. The moving picture was at once attractive and repellent to me. It became instantly apparent that the majority of the men and women there had but a single interest in life, that of centring attention upon themselves; and their various meth<a id="Page_55" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[55]"></a>ods of reaching this desirable end were curious and wonderful in the extreme. For all practical purposes, they were still on the boards which they had left but an hour or two before. It seemed as if they regarded the very orchestra in the light of a specially contrived accompaniment to their several actions and movements. As they glanced carelessly at me, I felt that they held me as a foreigner, as one outside that incredible little world of theirs which they call "the profession." And so I felt crushed, with a faint resemblance to a worm. You see, I was young.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I walked through towards the main salon, and in the doorway between the two rooms I met a girl of striking appearance, who was followed by two others. I knew her face well, having seen it often in photograph shops; it was the face of Marie Deschamps, the popular divette of the Diana Theatre, the leading lady of Sullivan's long-lived musical comedy, "My Queen." I needed no second glance to convince me that Miss Deschamps was a very important personage indeed, and, further, that a large proportion of her salary of seventy-five pounds a week was expended in the suits and trappings of triumph. If her dress did <a id="Page_56" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[56]"></a>not prove that she was on the topmost bough of the tree, then nothing could. Though that night is still recent history, times have changed. Divettes could do more with three hundred a month then than they can with eight hundred now.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As we passed she examined me with a curiosity whose charm was its frankness. Of course, she put me out of countenance, particularly when she put her hand on my sleeve. Divettes have the right to do these things.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I know who you are," she said, laughing and showing her teeth. "You are dear old Sully's cousin; he pointed you out to me the other night when you were at the Diana. Now, don't say you aren't, or I shall look such a fool; and for goodness' sake don't say you don't know me—because everyone knows me, and if they don't they ought to."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was swept away by the exuberance of her attack, and, blushing violently, I took the small hand which she offered, and assured her that I was in fact Sullivan Smith's cousin, and her sincere admirer.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"That's all right," she said, raising her superb shoulders after a special manner of her own. "Now you shall take me to Sulli<a id="Page_57" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[57]"></a>van, and he shall introduce us. Any friend of dear old Sully's is a friend of mine. How do you like my new song?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What new song?" I inquired incautiously.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Why, 'Who milked the cow?' of course."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I endeavored to give her to understand that it had made an indelible impression on me; and with such like converse we went in search of Sullivan, while everyone turned to observe the unknown shy young man who was escorting Marie Deschamps.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Here he is," my companion said at length, as we neared the orchestra, "listening to the band. He should have a band, the little dear! Sullivan, introduce me to your cousin."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Charmed—delighted." And Sullivan beamed with pleasure. "Ah, my young friend," he went on to me, "you know your way about fairly well. But there! medical students—they're all alike. Well, what do you think of the show?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Hasn't he done it awfully well, Mr. Foster?" said Miss Deschamps.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I said that I should rather think he had.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Look here," said Sullivan, becoming grave and dropping his voice, "there are four hundred invitations, and it'll cost me seven hun<a id="Page_58" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[58]"></a>dred and fifty pounds. But it pays. You know that, don't you, Marie? Look at the advertisement! And I've got a lot of newspaper chaps here. It'll be in every paper to-morrow. I reckon I've done this thing on the right lines. It's only a reception, of course, but let me tell you I've seen after the refreshments—not snacks—refreshments, mind you! And there's a smoke-room for the boys, and the wife's got a spiritualism-room, and there's the show in this room. Some jolly good people here, too—not all chorus girls and walking gents. Are they, Marie?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You bet not," the lady replied.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Rosetta Rosa's coming, and she won't go quite everywhere—not quite! By the way, it's about time she did come." He looked at his watch.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Ah, Mr. Foster," the divette said, "you must tell me all about that business. I'm told you were there, and that there was a terrible scene."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What business?" I inquired.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"At the Opera the other night, when Alresca broke his thigh. Didn't you go behind and save his life?"</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_59" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[59]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"I didn't precisely save his life, but I attended to him."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"They say he is secretly married to Rosa. Is that so?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I really can't say, but I think not."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What did she say to him when she went into his dressing-room? I know all about it, because one of our girls has a sister who's in the Opera chorus, and her sister saw Rosa go in. I do want to know what she said, and what he said."</p>
<p class="calibre4">An impulse seized me to invent a harmless little tale for the diversion of Marie Deschamps. I was astonished at my own enterprise. I perceived that I was getting accustomed to the society of greatness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Really?" she exclaimed, when I had finished.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I assure you."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"He's teasing," Sullivan said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Mr. Foster wouldn't do such a thing," she observed, drawing herself up, and I bowed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A man with an eye-glass came and began to talk confidently in Sullivan's ear, and Sullivan had to leave us.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"See you later," he smiled. "Keep him out of mischief, Marie. And I say, Carl, the wife <a id="Page_60" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[60]"></a>said I was to tell you particularly to go into her crystal-gazing room. Don't forget."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I'll go, too," Miss Deschamps said. "You may take me there now, if you please. And then I must go down to where the champagne is flowing. But not with you, not with you, Mr. Foster. There are other gentlemen here very anxious for the post. Now come along."</p>
<p class="calibre4">We made our way out of the stir and noise of the grand salon, Marie Deschamps leaning on my arm in the most friendly and confiding way in the world, and presently we found ourselves in a much smaller apartment crowded with whispering seekers after knowledge of the future. This room was dimly lighted from the ceiling by a single electric light, whose shade was a queer red Japanese lantern. At the other end of it were double curtains. These opened just as we entered, and Emmeline appeared, leading by the hand a man who was laughing nervously.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Your fortune, ladies and gentlemen, your fortune!" she cried pleasantly. Then she recognized me, and her manner changed, or I fancied that it did.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Ah, Carl, so you've arrived!" she ex<a id="Page_61" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[61]"></a>claimed, coming forward and ignoring all her visitors except Marie and myself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes, Emmeline, dear," said Marie, "we've come. And, please, I want to see something in the crystal. How do you do it?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">Emmeline glanced around.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Sullivan said my crystal-gazing would be a failure," she smiled. "But it isn't, is it? I came in here as soon as I had done receiving, and I've already had I don't know how many clients. I sha'n't be able to stop long, you know. The fact is, Sullivan doesn't like me being here at all. He thinks it not right of the hostess...."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"But it's perfectly charming of you!" some one put in.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Perfectly delicious!" said Marie.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Now, who shall I take first?" Emmeline asked, puzzled.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Oh, me, of course!" Marie Deschamps replied without a hesitation or a doubt, though she and I had come in last. And the others acquiesced, because Marie was on the topmost bough of all.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Come along, then," said Emmeline, relieved.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I made as if to follow them.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_62" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[62]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"No, Mr. Foster," said Marie. "You just stay here, and don't listen."</p>
<p class="calibre4">The two women disappeared behind the portière, and a faint giggle, soon suppressed, came through the portière from Marie.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I obeyed her orders, but as I had not the advantage of knowing a single person in that outer room, I took myself off for a stroll, in the hope of encountering Rosetta Rosa. Yes, certainly in the hope of encountering Rosetta Rosa! But in none of the thronged chambers did I discover her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I came back, the waiting-room for prospective crystal-gazers was empty, and Emmeline herself was just leaving it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What!" I exclaimed. "All over?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes," she said; "Sullivan has sent for me. You see, of course, one has to mingle with one's guests. Only they're really Sullivan's guests."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"And what about me?" I said. "Am I not going to have a look into the crystal?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had, as a matter of fact, not the slightest interest in her crystal at that instant. I regarded the crystal as a harmless distraction of hers, and I was being simply jocular when I made that remark. Emmeline, however, took <a id="Page_63" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[63]"></a>it seriously. As her face had changed when she first saw me in the box at the Opera, and again to-night when she met me and Marie Deschamps on my arm, so once more it changed now.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Do you really want to?" she questioned me, in her thrilling voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My soul said: "It's all rubbish—but suppose there is something in it, after all?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">And I said aloud:</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Come, then."</p>
<p class="calibre4">We passed through the room with the red Japanese lantern, and lo! the next room was perfectly dark save for an oval of white light which fell slantingly on a black marble table. The effect was rather disconcerting at first; but the explanation was entirely simple. The light came from an electric table-lamp (with a black cardboard shade arranged at an angle) which stood on the table. As my eyes grew accustomed to the obscurity I discovered two chairs.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Sit down," said Emmeline.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And she and I each took one of the chairs, at opposite sides of the table.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Emmeline was magnificently attired. As I <a id="Page_64" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[64]"></a>looked at her in the dimness across the table, she drummed her fingers on the marble, and then she bent her face to glance within the shade of the lamp, and for a second her long and heavy, yet handsome, features were displayed to the minutest part in the blinding ray of the lamp, and the next second they were in obscurity again. It was uncanny. I was impressed; and all the superstition which, like a snake, lies hidden in the heart of every man, stirred vaguely and raised its head.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Carl—" Emmeline began, and paused.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The woman indubitably did affect me strangely. Hers was a lonely soul, an unusual mixture of the absolutely conventional and of something quite else—something bizarre, disturbing, and inexplicable. I was conscious of a feeling of sympathy for her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Well?" I murmured.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Do you believe in the supernatural?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I neither believe nor disbelieve," I replied, "for I have never met with anything that might be a manifestation of it. But I may say that I am not a hard and fast materialist." And I added: "Do you believe in it?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Of course," she snapped.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Then, if you really believe, if it's so seri<a id="Page_65" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[65]"></a>ous to you, why do you make a show of it for triflers?".</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Ah!" she breathed. "Some of them do make me angry. They like to play at having dealings with the supernatural. But I thought the crystal would be such a good thing for Sullivan's reception. It is very important to Sullivan that this should be a great success—our first large public reception, you know. Sullivan says we must advertise ourselves."</p>
<p class="calibre4">The explanation of her motives was given so naïvely, so simply and unaffectedly, that it was impossible to take exception to it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Where's the crystal?" I inquired.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It is here," she said, and she rolled a glass ball with the suddenness that had the appearance of magic from the dark portion of the table's surface into the oval of light. And it was so exactly spherical, and the table top was so smooth that it would not stay where it was put, and she had to hold it there with her ringed hand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"So that's it," I remarked.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Carl," she said, "it is only right I should warn you. Some weeks ago I saw in the crystal the face of a man whom I did not know. I saw it again and again—and always the <a id="Page_66" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[66]"></a>same scene. Then I saw you at the Opera last week, and Sullivan introduced you as his cousin that he talks about sometimes. Did you notice that night that I behaved rather queerly?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes." I spoke shortly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You are the man whom I saw in the crystal."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Really?" I ejaculated, smiling, or at least trying to smile. "And what is the scene of which I am part?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You are standing—But no!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">She abruptly ceased speaking and coughed, clearing her throat, and she fixed her large eyes on me. Outside I could hear the distant strain of the orchestra, and the various noises of a great crowd of people. But this little dark room, with its sharply defined oval of light, was utterly shut off from the scene of gaiety. I was aware of an involuntary shiver, and for the life of me I could not keep my gaze steadily on the face of the tall woman who sat so still, with such impressiveness, on the other side of the table. I waited for her to proceed, and after what seemed a long interval she spoke again:</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_67" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[67]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"You aren't afraid, are you?" she demanded.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Of course I'm not."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Then you shall look into the crystal and try to see what I saw. I will not tell you. You shall try to see for yourself. You may succeed, if I help you. Now, try to free your mind from every thought, and look earnestly. Look!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">I drew the globe towards me from under her fingers.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Rum!" I murmured to myself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then I strenuously fixed my eyes on the glinting depths of the crystal, full of strange, shooting fires; but I could see nothing whatever.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"No go!" I said. "You'll have to tell me what you saw."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Patience. There is time yet. Look again. Take my hand in your right hand."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I obeyed, and we sat together in the tense silence. After a few minutes, the crystal darkened and then slowly cleared. I trembled with an uneasy anticipation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You see something," she breathed sorrowfully in my ear.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Not yet, not yet," I whispered. "But it <a id="Page_68" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[68]"></a>is coming. Yes, I see myself, and—and—a woman—a very pretty woman. I am clasping her hand."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Don't you recognize the woman?" Again Emmeline's voice vibrated like a lamentation in my ear. I did recognize the woman, and the sweat stood on my brow.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It is Rosetta Rosa!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"And what else do you see?" my questioner pursued remorselessly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I see a figure behind us," I stammered, "but what figure I cannot make out. It is threatening me. It is threatening me! It is a horrible thing. It will kill me! Ah—!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">I jumped up with a nervous movement. The crystal, left to itself, rolled off the table to the floor, and fell with a thud unbroken on the soft carpet. And I could hear the intake of Emmeline's breath.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At that moment the double portière was pulled apart, and some one stood there in the red light from the Japanese lantern.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Is Mr. Foster here? I want him to come with me," said a voice. And it was the voice of Rosa.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Just behind her was Sullivan.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I expected you'd be here," laughed Sullivan.</p>
<hr class="c"/>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_69" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[69]"></a></p>
<div class="calibre5"></div><div class="calibre5"></div><h2 id="pgepubid00018" class="calibre6"><a id="CHAPTER_V" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre12"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00019" class="calibre3">THE DAGGER AND THE MAN</h3>
<p class="calibre4">Rosetta Rosa and I threaded through the crowd towards the Embankment entrance of the Gold Rooms. She had spoken for a few moments with Emmeline, who went pale with satisfaction at the candid friendliness of her tone, and she had chatted quite gaily with Sullivan himself; and we had all been tremendously impressed by her beauty and fine grace—I certainly not the least. And then she had asked me, with a quality of mysteriousness in her voice, to see her to her carriage.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And, with her arm in mine, it was impossible for me to believe that she could influence, in any evil way, my future career. That she might be the cause of danger to my life seemed ridiculous. She was the incarnation of kindliness and simplicity. She had nothing about her of the sinister, and further, with all her transcendent beauty and charm, she was also the incarnation of the matter-of-fact. I am <a id="Page_70" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[70]"></a>obliged to say this, though I fear that it may impair for some people the vision of her loveliness and her unique personality. She was the incarnation of the matter-of-fact, because she appeared to be invariably quite unconscious of the supremacy of her talents. She was not weighed down by them, as many artists of distinction are weighed down. She carried them lightly, seemingly unaware that they existed. Thus no one could have guessed that that very night she had left the stage of the Opera after an extraordinary triumph in her greatest rôle—that of Isolde in "Tristan."</p>
<p class="calibre4">And so her presence by my side soothed away almost at once the excitation and the spiritual disturbance of the scene through which I had just passed with Emmeline; and I was disposed, if not to laugh at the whole thing, at any rate to regard it calmly, dispassionately, as one of the various inexplicable matters with which one meets in a world absurdly called prosaic. I was sure that no trick had been played upon me. I was sure that I had actually seen in the crystal what I had described to Emmeline, and that she, too, had seen it. But then, I argued, such an experi<a id="Page_71" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[71]"></a>ence might be the result of hypnotic suggestion, or of thought transference, or of some other imperfectly understood agency.... Rosetta Rosa an instrument of misfortune! No!</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I looked at her I comprehended how men have stopped at nothing for the sake of love, and how a woman, if only she be beautiful enough, may wield a power compared to which the sway of a Tsar, even a Tsar unhampered by Dumas, is impotence itself. Even at that early stage I had begun to be a captive to her. But I did not believe that her rule was malign.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Mr. Foster," she said, "I have asked you to see me to my carriage, but really I want you to do more than that. I want you to go with me to poor Alresca's. He is progressing satisfactorily, so far as I can judge, but the dear fellow is thoroughly depressed. I saw him this afternoon, and he wished, if I met you here to-night, that I should bring you to him. He has a proposition to make to you, and I hope you will accept it."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I shall accept it, then," I said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She pulled out a tiny gold watch, glistening with diamonds.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It is half-past one," she said. "We might <a id="Page_72" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[72]"></a>be there in ten minutes. You don't mind it being late, I suppose. We singers, you know, have our own hours."</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the foyer we had to wait while the carriage was called. I stood silent, and perhaps abstracted, at her elbow, absorbed in the pride and happiness of being so close to her, and looking forward with a tremulous pleasure to the drive through London at her side. She was dressed in gray, with a large ermine-lined cloak, and she wore no ornaments except a thin jewelled dagger in her lovely hair.</p>
<p class="calibre4">All at once I saw that she flushed, and, following the direction of her eyes, I beheld Sir Cyril Smart, with a startled gaze fixed immovably on her face. Except the footmen and the attendants attached to the hotel, there were not half a dozen people in the entrance-hall at this moment. Sir Cyril was nearly as white as the marble floor. He made a step forward, and then stood still. She, too, moved towards him, as it seemed, involuntarily.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Good evening, Miss Rosa," he said at length, with a stiff inclination. She responded, and once more they stared at each other. I wondered whether they had quarrelled again, or whether both were by some mischance <a id="Page_73" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[73]"></a>simultaneously indisposed. Surely they must have already met during the evening at the Opera!</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then Rosa, with strange deliberation, put her hand to her hair and pulled out the jewelled dagger.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Sir Cyril," she said, "you seem fascinated by this little weapon. Do you recognize it?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">He made no answer, nor moved, but I noticed that his hands were tightly clenched.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You do recognize it, Sir Cyril?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">At last he nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Then take it. The dagger shall be yours. To-night, within the last minute, I think I have suddenly discovered that, next to myself, you have the best right to it."</p>
<p class="calibre4">He opened his lips to speak, but made no sound.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"See," she said. "It is a real dagger, sharp and pointed."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Throwing back her cloak with a quick gesture, she was about to prick the skin of her left arm between the top of her long glove and the sleeve of her low-cut dress. But Sir Cyril, and I also, jumped to stop her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Don't do that," I said. "You might hurt yourself."</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_74" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[74]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">She glanced at me, angry for the instant; but her anger dissolved in an icy smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Take it, Sir Cyril, to please me."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her intonation was decidedly peculiar.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And Sir Cyril took the dagger.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Miss Rosa's carriage," a commissionaire shouted, and, beckoning to me, the girl moved imperiously down the steps to the courtyard. There was no longer a smile on her face, which had a musing and withdrawn expression. Sir Cyril stood stock-still, holding the dagger. What the surrounding lackeys thought of this singular episode I will not guess. Indeed, the longer I live, the less I care to meditate upon what lackeys do think. But that the adventures of their employers provide them with ample food for thought there can be no doubt.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rosa's horses drew us swiftly away from the Grand Babylon Hotel, and it seemed that she wished to forget or to ignore the remarkable incident. For some moments she sat silent, her head slightly bent, her cloak still thrown back, but showing no sign of agitation beyond a slightly hurried heaving of the bosom.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was discreet enough not to break in upon her reflections by any attempt at conversation, <a id="Page_75" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[75]"></a>for it seemed to me that what I had just witnessed had been a sudden and terrible crisis, not only in the life of Sir Cyril, but also in that of the girl whose loveliness was dimly revealed to me in the obscurity of the vehicle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We had got no further than Trafalgar Square when she aroused herself, looked at me, and gave a short laugh.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I suppose," she remarked, "that a doctor can't cure every disease?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Scarcely," I replied.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Not even a young doctor?" she said with comical gravity.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Not even a young doctor," I gravely answered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then we both laughed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You must excuse my fun," she said. "I can't help it, especially when my mind is disturbed."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Why do you ask me?" I inquired. "Was it just a general observation caused by the seriousness of my countenance, or were you thinking of something in particular?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I was thinking of Alresca," she murmured, "my poor Alresca. He is the rarest gentleman and the finest artist in Europe, and he is suffering."</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_76" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[76]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"Well," I said, "one can't break one's thigh for nothing."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It is not his thigh. It is something else."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">She shook her head, to indicate her inability to answer.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Here I must explain that, on the morning after the accident, I had taken a hansom to the Devonshire Mansion with the intention of paying a professional visit to Alresca. I was not altogether certain that I ought to regard the case as mine, but I went. Immediately before my hansom, however, there had drawn up another hansom in front of the portals of the Devonshire, and out of that other hansom had stepped the famous Toddy MacWhister. Great man as Toddy was, he had an eye on "saxpences," and it was evident that, in spite of the instructions which he had given me as to the disposal of Alresca, Toddy was claiming the patient for his own. I retired. It was the only thing I could do. Two doctors were not needed, and I did not see myself, a young man scarcely yet escaped from the fear of examinations, disputing cases with the redoubtable Toddy. I heard afterwards that he had prolonged his stay in London in order to at<a id="Page_77" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[77]"></a>tend Alresca. So that I had not seen the tenor since his accident.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What does Monsieur Alresca want to see me about?" I demanded cautiously.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"He will tell you," said Rosa, equally cautious.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A silence followed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Do you think I upset him—that night?" she asked.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You wish me to be frank?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"If I had thought you would not be frank I would not have asked you. Do you imagine it is my habit to go about putting awkward questions like that?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I think you did upset him very much."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You think I was wrong?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I do."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Perhaps you are right," she admitted.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had been bold. A desire took me to be still bolder. She was in the carriage with me. She was not older than I. And were she Rosetta Rosa, or a mere miss taken at hazard out of a drawing-room, she was feminine and I was masculine. In short—Well, I have fits of rashness sometimes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You say he is depressed," I addressed her <a id="Page_78" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[78]"></a>firmly. "And I will venture to inform you that I am not in the least surprised."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Oh!" she exclaimed. "And why?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"After what you said to him that night in the dressing-room. If I had been in Alresca's place I know that I should be depressed, and very much depressed, too."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You mean—" she faltered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes," I said, "I mean that."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I thought I had gone pretty far, and my heart was beating. I could not justly have protested had she stopped the carriage and deposited me on the pavement by the railings of Green Park. But her character was angelic. She accepted my treatment of her with the most astounding meekness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You mean," she said, "that he is in love with me, and I chose just that night to—refuse him."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"That is emotional cause enough, isn't it, to account for any mysterious depression that any man is ever likely to have?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You are mistaken," she said softly. "You don't know Alresca. You don't know his strength of mind. I can assure you that it <a id="Page_79" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[79]"></a>is something more than unreturned love that is destroying him."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Destroying him?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes, destroying him. Alresca is capable of killing a futile passion. His soul is too far removed from his body, and even from his mind, to be seriously influenced by the mistakes and misfortunes of his mind and body. Do you understand me?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I think so."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What is the matter with Alresca is something in his most secret soul."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"And you can form no idea of what it is?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">She made no reply.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Doctors certainly can't cure such diseases as that," I said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"They can try," said Rosetta Rosa.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You wish me to try?" I faced her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She inclined her head.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Then I will," I said with sudden passionateness, forgetting even that I was not Alresca's doctor.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The carriage stopped. In the space of less than a quarter of an hour, so it seemed to me, we had grown almost intimate—she and I.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Alresca's man was awaiting us in the por<a id="Page_80" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[80]"></a>tico of the Devonshire, and without a word he led us to his master. Alresca lay on his back on a couch in a large and luxuriously littered drawing-room. The pallor of his face and the soft brilliance of his eyes were infinitely pathetic, and again he reminded me of the tragic and gloomy third act of "Tristan." He greeted us kindly in his quiet voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I have brought the young man," said Rosa, "and now, after I have inquired about your health, I must go. It is late. Are you better, Alresca?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I am better now that you are here," he smiled. "But you must not go yet. It is many days since I heard a note of music. Sing to me before you go."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"To-night?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes, to-night."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What shall I sing?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Anything, so that I hear your voice."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I will sing 'Elsa's Dream.' But who will accompany? You know I simply can't play to my own singing."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I gathered together all my courage.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I'm an awful player," I said, "but I know the whole score of 'Lohengrin.'"</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_81" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[81]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"How clever of you!" Rosa laughed. "I'm sure you play beautifully."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Alresca rewarded me with a look, and, trembling, I sat down to the piano. I was despicably nervous. Before the song was finished I had lost everything but honor; but I played that accompaniment to the most marvellous soprano in the world.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And what singing! Rosa stood close beside me. I caught the golden voice at its birth. Every vibration, every shade of expression, every subtlety of feeling was mine; and the experience was unforgettable. Many times since then have I heard Rosa sing, many times in my hearing has she excited a vast audience to overwhelming enthusiasm; but never, to my mind, has she sung so finely as on that night. She was profoundly moved, she had in Alresca the ideal listener, and she sang with the magic power of a goddess. It was the summit of her career.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"There is none like you," Alresca said, and the praise of Alresca brought the crimson to her cheek. He was probably the one person living who had the right to praise her, for an artist can only be properly estimated by his equals.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_82" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[82]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"Come to me, Rosa," he murmured, as he took her hand in his and kissed it. "You are in exquisite voice to-night," he said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Am I?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes. You have been excited; and I notice that you always sing best under excitement."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Perhaps," she replied. "The fact is, I have just met—met some one whom I never expected to meet. That is all. Good night, dear friend."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Good night."</p>
<p class="calibre4">She passed her hand soothingly over his forehead.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When we were alone Alresca seemed to be overtaken by lassitude.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Surely," I said, "it is not by Toddy—I mean Dr. Todhunter MacWhister's advice that you keep these hours. The clocks are striking two!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Ah, my friend," he replied wearily, in his precise and rather elaborate English, "ill or well, I must live as I have been accustomed to live. For twenty years I have gone to bed promptly at three o'clock and risen at eleven o'clock. Must I change because of a broken thigh? In an hour's time, and not before, my people will carry this couch and its burden to <a id="Page_83" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[83]"></a>my bedroom. Then I shall pretend to sleep; but I shall not sleep. Somehow of late the habit of sleep has left me. Hitherto, I have scorned opiates, which are the refuge of the weak-minded, yet I fear I may be compelled to ask you for one. There was a time when I could will myself to sleep. But not now, not now!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I am not your medical adviser," I said, mindful of professional etiquette, "and I could not think of administering an opiate without the express permission of Dr. MacWhister."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Pardon me," he said, his eyes resting on me with a quiet satisfaction that touched me to the heart, "but you are my medical adviser, if you will honor me so far. I have not forgotten your neat hand and skilful treatment of me at the time of my accident. To-day the little Scotchman told me that my thigh was progressing quite admirably, and that all I needed was nursing. I suggested to him that you should finish the case. He had, in fact, praised your skill. And so, Mr. Foster, will you be my doctor? I want you to examine me thoroughly, for, unless I deceive myself, I am suffering from some mysterious complaint."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was enormously, ineffably flattered and <a id="Page_84" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[84]"></a>delighted, and all the boy in me wanted to caper around the room and then to fall on Alresca's neck and dissolve in gratitude to him. But instead of these feats, I put on a vast seriousness (which must really have been very funny to behold), and then I thanked Alresca in formal phrases, and then, quite in the correct professional style, I began to make gentle fun of his idea of a mysterious complaint, and I asked him for a catalogue of his symptoms. I perceived that he and Rosa must have previously arranged that I should be requested to become his doctor.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"There are no symptoms," he replied, "except a gradual loss of vitality. But examine me."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I did so most carefully, testing the main organs, and subjecting him to a severe cross-examination.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Well?" he said, as, after I had finished, I sat down to cogitate.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Well, Monsieur Alresca, all I can say is that your fancy is too lively. That is what you suffer from, an excitable fan—"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Stay, my friend," he interrupted me with a firm gesture. "Before you go any further, let me entreat you to be frank. Without abso<a id="Page_85" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[85]"></a>lute candor nothing can be done. I think I am a tolerable judge of faces, and I can read in yours the fact that my condition has puzzled you."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I paused, taken aback. It had puzzled me. I thought of all that Rosetta Rosa had said, and I hesitated. Then I made up my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I yield," I responded. "You are not an ordinary man, and it was absurd of me to treat you as one. Absolute candor is, as you say, essential, and so I'll confess that your case does puzzle me. There is no organic disease, but there is a quite unaccountable organic weakness—a weakness which fifty broken thighs would not explain. I must observe, and endeavor to discover the cause. In the meantime I have only one piece of advice. You know that in certain cases we have to tell women patients that a successful issue depends on their own willpower: I say the same thing to you."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Receive my thanks," he said. "You have acted as I hoped. As for the willpower, that is another matter," and a faint smile crossed his handsome, melancholy face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I rose to leave. It was nearly three o'clock.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_86" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[86]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"Give me a few moments longer. I have a favor to ask."</p>
<p class="calibre4">After speaking these words he closed his eyes, as though to recall the opening sentences of a carefully prepared speech.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I am entirely at your service," I murmured.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Mr. Foster," he began, "you are a young man of brilliant accomplishments, at the commencement of your career. Doubtless you have made your plans for the immediate future, and I feel quite sure that those plans do not include any special attendance upon myself, whom until the other day you had never met. I am a stranger to you, and on the part of a stranger it would be presumptuous to ask you to alter your plans. Nevertheless, I am at this moment capable of that presumption. In my life I have not often made requests, but such requests as I have made have never been refused. I hope that my good fortune in this respect may continue. Mr. Foster, I wish to leave England. I wish to die in my own place—"</p>
<p class="calibre4">I shrugged my shoulders in protest against the word "die."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"If you prefer it, I wish to live in my own <a id="Page_87" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[87]"></a>place. Will you accompany me as companion? I am convinced that we should suit each other—that I should derive benefit from your skill and pleasure from your society, while you—you would tolerate the whims and eccentricities of my middle age. We need not discuss terms; you would merely name your fee."</p>
<p class="calibre4">There was, as a matter of fact, no reason in the world why I should have agreed to this suggestion of Alresca's. As he himself had said, we were strangers, and I was under no obligation to him of any kind.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yet at once I felt an impulse to accept his proposal. Whence that impulse sprang I cannot say. Perhaps from the aspect of an adventure that the affair had. Perhaps from the vague idea that by attaching myself to Alresca I should be brought again into contact with Rosetta Rosa. Certainly I admired him immensely. None who knew him could avoid doing so. Already, indeed, I had for him a feeling akin to affection.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I see by your face," he said, "that you are not altogether unwilling. You accept?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"With pleasure;" and I smiled with the pleasure I felt.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But it seemed to me that I gave the answer <a id="Page_88" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[88]"></a>independently of my own volition. The words were uttered almost before I knew.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It is very good of you."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Not at all," I said. "I have made no plans, and therefore nothing will be disarranged. Further, I count it an honor; and, moreover, your 'case'—pardon the word—interests me deeply. Where do you wish to go?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"To Bruges, of course."</p>
<p class="calibre4">He seemed a little surprised that I should ask the question.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Bruges," he went on, "that dear and wonderful old city of Flanders, is the place of my birth. You have visited it?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"No," I said, "but I have often heard that it is the most picturesque city in Europe, and I should like to see it awfully."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"There is nothing in the world like Bruges," he said. "Bruges the Dead they call it; a fit spot in which to die."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"If you talk like that I shall reconsider my decision."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Pardon, pardon!" he laughed, suddenly wearing an appearance of gaiety. "I am happier now. When can we go? To-morrow? Let it be to-morrow."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Impossible," I said. "The idea of a man <a id="Page_89" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[89]"></a>whose thigh was broken less than a fortnight since taking a sea voyage to-morrow! Do you know that under the most favorable circumstances it will be another five or six weeks before the bone unites, and that even then the greatest care will be necessary?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">His gaiety passed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Five more weeks here?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I fear so."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"But our agreement shall come into operation at once. You will visit me daily? Rather, you will live here?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"If it pleases you. I am sure I shall be charmed to live here."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Let the time go quickly—let it fly! Ah, Mr. Foster, you will like Bruges. It is the most dignified of cities. It has the picturesqueness of Nuremburg, the waterways of Amsterdam, the squares of Turin, the monuments of Perugia, the cafés of Florence, and the smells of Cologne. I have an old house there of the seventeenth century; it is on the Quai des Augustins."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"A family affair?" I questioned.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"No; I bought it only a few years ago from a friend. I fear I cannot boast of much family. My mother made lace, my father was a school<a id="Page_90" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[90]"></a>master. They are both dead, and I have no relatives."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Somewhere in the building a clock struck three, and at that instant there was a tap at the door, and Alresca's valet discreetly entered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Monsieur rang?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"No, Alexis. Leave us."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Comprehending that it was at last Alresca's hour for retiring, I rose to leave, and called the man back.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Good night, dear friend," said Alresca, pressing my hand. "I shall expect you to-morrow, and in the meantime a room shall be prepared for you. Au revoir."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Alexis conducted me to the door. As he opened it he made a civil remark about the beauty of the night. I glanced at his face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You are English, aren't you?" I asked him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes, sir."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I only ask because Alexis is such a peculiar name for an Englishman."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It is merely a name given to me by Monsieur Alresca when I entered his service several years ago. My name is John Smedley."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Well, Mr. Smedley," I said, putting half a <a id="Page_91" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[91]"></a>sovereign into his hand, "I perceive that you are a man of intelligence."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Hope so, sir."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I am a doctor, and to-morrow, as I dare say you heard, I am coming to live here with your master in order to attend him medically."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes, sir."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"He says he is suffering from some mysterious complaint, Smedley."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"He told me as much, sir."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Do you know what that complaint is?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Haven't the least idea, sir. But he always seems low like, and he gets lower, especially during the nights. What might the complaint be, sir?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I wish I could tell you. By the way, haven't you had trained nurses there?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes, sir. The other doctor sent two. But the governor dismissed 'em yesterday. He told me they worried him. Me and the butler does what's necessary."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You say he is more depressed during the nights—you mean he shows the effects of that depression in the mornings?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Just so, sir."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I am going to be confidential, Smedley. Are you aware if your master has any secret <a id="Page_92" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[92]"></a>trouble on his mind, any worry that he reveals to no one?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"No, sir, I am not."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Thank you, Smedley. Good night."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Good night, sir, and thank you."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had obtained no light from Alexis, and I sought in vain for an explanation of my patient's condition. Of course, it was plausible enough to argue that his passion for Rosa was at the root of the evil; but I remembered Rosa's words to me in the carriage, and I was disposed to agree with them. To me, as to her, it seemed that, though Alresca was the sort of man to love deeply, he was not the sort of man to allow an attachment, however profound or unfortunate, to make a wreck of his existence. No. If Alresca was dying, he was not dying of love.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As Alexis had remarked, it was a lovely summer night, and after quitting the Devonshire I stood idly on the pavement, and gazed about me in simple enjoyment of the scene.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The finest trees in Hyde Park towered darkly in front of me, and above them was spread the star-strewn sky, with a gibbous moon just showing over the housetops to the left. I could not see a soul, but faintly from <a id="Page_93" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[93]"></a>the distance came the tramp of a policeman on his beat. The hour, to my busy fancy, seemed full of fate. But it was favorable to meditation, and I thought, and thought, and thought. Was I at the beginning of an adventure, or would the business, so strangely initiated, resolve itself into something prosaic and mediocre? I had a suspicion—indeed, I had a hope—that adventures were in store for me. Perhaps peril also. For the sinister impression originally made upon me by that ridiculous crystal-gazing scene into which I had been entrapped by Emmeline had returned, and do what I would I could not dismiss it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My cousin's wife was sincere, with all her vulgarity and inborn snobbishness. And that being assumed, how did I stand with regard to Rosetta Rosa? Was the thing a coincidence, or had I indeed crossed her path pursuant to some strange decree of Fate—a decree which Emmeline had divined or guessed or presaged? There was a certain weirdness about Emmeline that was rather puzzling.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had seen Rosa but twice, and her image, to use the old phrase, was stamped on my heart. True! Yet the heart of any young man who had talked with Rosa twice would <a id="Page_94" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[94]"></a>in all probability have been similarly affected. Rosa was not the ordinary pretty and clever girl. She was such a creature as grows in this world not often in a century. She was an angel out of Paradise—an angel who might pass across Europe and leave behind her a trail of broken hearts to mark the transit. And if angels could sing as she did, then no wonder that the heavenly choirs were happy in nothing but song. (You are to remember that it was three o'clock in the morning.) No, the fact that I was already half in love with Rosa proved nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">On the other hand, might not the manner in which she and Alresca had sought me out be held to prove something? Why should such exalted personages think twice about a mere student of medicine who had had the good fortune once to make himself useful at a critical juncture? Surely, I could argue that here was the hand of Fate.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rubbish! I was an ass to stand there at that unearthly hour, robbing myself of sleep in order to pursue such trains of thought. Besides, supposing that Rosa and myself were, in fact, drawn together by chance or fate, or whatever you like to call it, had not disaster <a id="Page_95" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[95]"></a>been prophesied in that event? It would be best to leave the future alone. My aim should be to cure Alresca, and then go soberly to Totnes and join my brother in practice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I turned down Oxford Street, whose perspective of gas-lamps stretched east and west to distances apparent infinite, and as I did so I suddenly knew that some one was standing by the railings opposite, under the shadow of the great trees. I had been so sure that I was alone that this discovery startled me a little, and I began to whistle tunelessly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I could make out no details of the figure, except that it was a man who stood there, and to satisfy my curiosity I went across to inspect him. To my astonishment he was very well, though very quietly, dressed, and had the appearance of being a gentleman of the highest distinction. His face was clean-shaven, and I noticed the fine, firm chin, and the clear, unblinking eyes. He stood quite still, and as I approached looked me full in the face. It was a terrible gaze, and I do not mind confessing that, secretly, I quailed under it; there was malice and a dangerous hate in that gaze. Nevertheless I was young, careless, and enterprising.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_96" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[96]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"Can you tell me if I am likely to get a cab at this time of night?" I asked as lightly as I could. I wanted to hear his voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But he returned no answer, merely gazing at me as before, without a movement.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Strange!" I said, half to myself. "The fellow must be deaf, or mad, or a foreigner."</p>
<p class="calibre4">The man smiled slightly, his lips drooping to a sneer. I retreated, and as I stepped back on the curb my foot touched some small object. I looked down, and in the dim light, for the dawn was already heralded, I saw the glitter of jewels. I stooped and picked the thing up. It was the same little dagger which but a few hours before I had seen Rosa present with so much formality to Sir Cyril Smart. But there was this difference—the tiny blade was covered with blood!</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00021" class="calibre3">ALRESCA'S FATE</h3>
<p class="calibre4">The house was large, and its beautiful façade fronted a narrow canal. To say that the spot was picturesque is to say little, for the whole of Bruges is picturesque. This corner of the Quai des Augustins was distinguished even in Bruges. The aspect of the mansion, with its wide entrance and broad courtyard, on which the inner windows looked down in regular array, was simple and dignified in the highest degree. The architecture was an entirely admirable specimen of Flemish domestic work of the best period, and the internal decoration and the furniture matched to a nicety the exterior. It was in that grave and silent abode, with Alresca, that I first acquired a taste for bric-â-brac. Ah! the Dutch marquetry, the French cabinetry, the Belgian brassware, the curious panellings, the oak-frames, the faience, the silver candlesticks, the <a id="Page_98" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[98]"></a>Amsterdam toys in silver, the Antwerp incunables, and the famous tenth-century illuminated manuscript in half-uncials! Such trifles abounded, and in that antique atmosphere they had the quality of exquisite fitness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And on the greenish waters of the canal floated several gigantic swans, with insatiable and endless appetites. We used to feed them from the dining-room windows, which overhung the canal.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was glad to be out of London, and as the days passed my gladness increased. I had not been pleased with myself in London. As the weeks followed each other, I had been compelled to admit to myself that the case of Alresca held mysteries for me, even medical mysteries. During the first day or two I had thought that I understood it, and I had despised the sayings of Rosetta Rosa in the carriage, and the misgivings with which my original examination of Alresca had inspired me. And then I gradually perceived that, after all, the misgivings had been justified. The man's thigh made due progress; but the man, slowly failing, lost interest in the struggle for life.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Here I might proceed to a technical disser<a id="Page_99" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[99]"></a>tation upon his physical state, but it would be useless. A cloud of long words will not cover ignorance; and I was most emphatically ignorant. At least, such knowledge as I had obtained was merely of a negative character. All that I could be sure of was that this was by no means an instance of mysterious disease. There was no disease, as we understand the term. In particular, there was no decay of the nerve-centres. Alresca was well—in good health. What he lacked was the will to live—that strange and mystic impulse which alone divides us from death. It was, perhaps, hard on a young G.P. to be confronted by such a medical conundrum at the very outset of his career; but, then, the Maker of conundrums seldom considers the age and inexperience of those who are requested to solve them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yes, this was the first practical proof that had come to me of the sheer empiricism of the present state of medicine.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We had lived together—Alresca and I—peaceably, quietly, sadly. He appeared to have ample means, and the standard of luxury which existed in his flat was a high one. He was a connoisseur in every department of art and life, and took care that he was well served. <a id="Page_100" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[100]"></a>Perhaps it would be more correct to say that he had once taken care to be well served, and that the custom primarily established went on by its own momentum. For he did not exercise even such control as a sick man might have been expected to exercise. He seemed to be concerned with nothing, save that occasionally he would exhibit a flickering curiosity as to the opera season which was drawing to a close.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Unfortunately, there was little operatic gossip to be curious about. Rosa had fulfilled her engagement and gone to another capital, and since her departure the season had, perhaps inevitably, fallen flat. Of course, the accident to and indisposition of Alresca had also contributed to this end. And there had been another factor in the case—a factor which, by the way, constituted the sole item of news capable of rousing Alresca from his torpor. I refer to the disappearance of Sir Cyril Smart.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Soon after my cousin Sullivan's reception, the papers had reported Sir Cyril to be ill, and then it was stated that he had retired to a remote Austrian watering-place (name unmentioned) in order to rest and recuperate. Certain weekly papers of the irresponsible sort <a id="Page_101" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[101]"></a>gave publicity to queer rumors—that Sir Cyril had fought a duel and been wounded, that he had been attacked one night in the streets, even that he was dead. But these rumors were generally discredited, and meanwhile the opera season ran its course under the guidance of Sir Cyril's head man, Mr. Nolan, so famous for his diamond shirt-stud.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Perhaps I could have thrown some light upon the obscurity which enveloped the doings of Sir Cyril Smart. But I preferred to remain inactive. Locked away in my writing-case I kept the jewelled dagger so mysteriously found by me outside the Devonshire Mansion.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had mentioned the incidents of that night to no one, and probably not a soul on the planet guessed that the young doctor in attendance upon Alresca had possession of a little toy-weapon which formed a startling link between two existences supposed to be unconnected save in the way of business—those of Sir Cyril and Rosetta Rosa. I hesitated whether to send the dagger to Rosa, and finally decided that I would wait until I saw her again, if ever that should happen, and then do as circumstances should dictate. I often <a id="Page_102" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[102]"></a>wondered whether the silent man with the fixed gaze, whom I had met in Oxford Street that night, had handled the dagger, or whether his presence was a mere coincidence. To my speculations I discovered no answer.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then the moment had come when Alresca's thigh was so far mended that, under special conditions, we could travel, and one evening, after a journey full of responsibilities for me, we had arrived in Bruges.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Soon afterwards came a slight alteration.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Alresca took pleasure in his lovely house, and I was aware of an improvement in his condition. The torpor was leaving him, and his spirits grew livelier. Unfortunately, it was difficult to give him outdoor exercise, since the roughly paved streets made driving impossible for him, and he was far from being able to walk. After a time I contrived to hire a large rowing boat, and on fine afternoons it was our custom to lower him from the quay among the swans into this somewhat unwieldy craft, so that he might take the air as a Venetian. The idea tickled him, and our progress along the disused canals was always a matter of interest to the towns-people, who showed an unappeasable inquis<a id="Page_103" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[103]"></a>itiveness concerning their renowned fellow citizen.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was plain to me that he was recovering; that he had lifted himself out of the circle of that strange influence under which he had nearly parted with his life. The fact was plain to me, but the explanation of the fact was not plain. I was as much puzzled by his rise as I had been puzzled by his descent. But that did not prevent me from trying to persuade myself that this felicitous change in my patient's state must be due, after all, to the results of careful dieting, a proper curriculum of daily existence, supervision of mental tricks and habits—in short, of all that minute care and solicitude which only a resident doctor can give to a sick man.</p>
<p class="calibre4">One evening he was especially alert and gay, and I not less so. We were in the immense drawing-room, which, like the dining-room, overlooked the canal. Dinner was finished—we dined at six, the Bruges hour—and Alresca lay on his invalid's couch, ejecting from his mouth rings of the fine blue smoke of a Javanese cigar, a box of which I had found at the tobacco shop kept by two sisters at the corner of the Grande Place. I <a id="Page_104" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[104]"></a>stood at the great central window, which was wide open, and watched the whiteness of the swans moving vaguely over the surface of the canal in the oncoming twilight. The air was warm and heavy, and the long, high-pitched whine of the mosquito swarms—sole pest of the city—had already begun.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Alresca," I said, "your days as an invalid are numbered."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Why do you say that?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"No one who was really an invalid could possibly enjoy that cigar as you are enjoying it."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"A good cigar—a glass of good wine," he murmured, savoring the perfume of the cigar. "What would life be without them?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"A few weeks ago, and you would have said: 'What is life even with them?'"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Then you really think I am better?" he smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I'm sure of it."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"As for me," he returned, "I confess it. That has happened which I thought never would happen. I am once more interested in life. The wish to live has come back. I am glad to be alive. Carl, your first case has been a success."</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_105" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[105]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"No thanks to me," I said. "Beyond seeing that you didn't displace the broken pieces of your thigh-bone, what have I done? Nothing. No one knows that better than you do."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"That's your modesty—your incurable modesty."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I shook my head, and went to stand by his couch. I was profoundly aware then, despite all the efforts of my self-conceit to convince myself to the contrary, that I had effected nothing whatever towards his recovery, that it had accomplished itself without external aid. But that did not lessen my intense pleasure in the improvement. By this time I had a most genuine affection for Alresca. The rare qualities of the man—his serenity, his sense of justice, his invariable politeness and consideration, the pureness of his soul—had captured me completely. I was his friend. Perhaps I was his best friend in the world. The singular circumstances of our coming together had helped much to strengthen the tie between us. I glanced down at him, full of my affection for him, and minded to take advantage of the rights of that affection for once in a way.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_106" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[106]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"Alresca," I said quietly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Well?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What was it?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What was what?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">I met his gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What was that thing that you have fought and driven off? What is the mystery of it? You know—you must know. Tell me."</p>
<p class="calibre4">His eyelids fell.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Better to leave the past alone," said he. "Granting that I had formed an idea, I could not put it into proper words. I have tried to do so. In the expectation of death I wrote down certain matters. But these I shall now destroy. I am wiser, less morbid. I can perceive that there are fields of thought of which it is advisable to keep closed the gates. Do as I do, Carl—forget. Take the credit for my recovery, and be content with that."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I felt that he was right, and resumed my position near the window, humming a tune.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"In a week you may put your foot to the ground; you will then no longer have to be carried about like a parcel." I spoke in a casual tone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Good!" he ejaculated.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_107" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[107]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"And then our engagement will come to an end, and you will begin to sing again."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Ah!" he said contemplatively, after a pause, "sing!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">It seemed as if singing was a different matter.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes," I repeated, "sing. You must throw yourself into that. It will be the best of all tonics."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Have I not told you that I should never sing again?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Perhaps you have," I replied; "but I don't remember. And even if you have, as you yourself have just said, you are now wiser, less morbid."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"True!" he murmured. "Yes, I must sing. They want me at Chicago. I will go, and while there I will spread abroad the fame of Carl Foster."</p>
<p class="calibre4">He smiled gaily, and then his face became meditative and sad.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"My artistic career has never been far away from tragedy," he said at length. "It was founded on a tragedy, and not long ago I thought it would end in one."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I waited in silence, knowing that if he <a id="Page_108" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[108]"></a>wished to tell me any private history, he would begin of his own accord.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You are listening, Carl?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">I nodded. It was growing dusk.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You remember I pointed out to you the other day the little house in the Rue d'Ostende where my parents lived?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Perfectly."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"That," he proceeded, using that curiously formal and elaborate English which he must have learned from reading-books, "that was the scene of the tragedy which made me an artist. I have told you that my father was a schoolmaster. He was the kindest of men, but he had moods of frightful severity—moods which subsided as quickly as they arose. At the age of three, just as I was beginning to talk easily, I became, for a period, subject to fits; and in one of these I lost the power of speech. I, Alresca, could make no sound; and for seven years that tenor whom in the future people were to call 'golden-throated,' and 'world-famous,' and 'unrivalled,' had no voice." He made a deprecatory gesture. "When I think of it, Carl, I can scarcely believe it—so strange are the <a id="Page_109" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[109]"></a>chances of life. I could hear and understand, but I could not speak.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Of course, that was forty years ago, and the system of teaching mutes to talk was not then invented, or, at any rate, not generally understood. So I was known and pitied as the poor dumb boy. I took pleasure in dumb animals, and had for pets a silver-gray cat, a goat, and a little spaniel. One afternoon—I should be about ten years old—my father came home from his school and sitting down, laid his head on the table and began to cry. Seeing him cry, I also began to cry; I was acutely sensitive.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"'What is the matter?' asked my good mother.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"'Alas!' he said, 'I am a murderer!'</p>
<p class="calibre4">"'Nay, that cannot be,' she replied.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"'I say it is so,' said my father. 'I have murdered a child—a little girl. I grumbled at her yesterday. I was annoyed and angry—because she had done her lessons ill. I sent her home, but instead of going home she went to the outer canal and drowned herself. They came and told me this afternoon. Yes, I am a murderer!'</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I howled, while my mother tried to com<a id="Page_110" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[110]"></a>fort my father, pointing out to him that if he had spoken roughly to the child it was done for the child's good, and that he could not possibly have foreseen the catastrophe. But her words were in vain.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"We all went to bed. In the middle of the night I heard my dear silver-gray cat mewing at the back of the house. She had been locked out. I rose and went down-stairs to let her in. To do so it was necessary for me to pass through the kitchen. It was quite dark, and I knocked against something in the darkness. With an inarticulate scream, I raced up-stairs again to my parents' bedroom. I seized my mother by her night-dress and dragged her towards the door. She stopped only to light a candle, and hand-in-hand we went down-stairs to the kitchen. The candle threw around its fitful, shuddering glare, and my mother's eyes followed mine. Some strange thing happened in my throat.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"'Mother!' I cried, in a hoarse, uncouth, horrible voice, and, casting myself against her bosom, I clung convulsively to her. From a hook in the ceiling beam my father's corpse dangled. He had hanged himself in the <a id="Page_111" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[111]"></a>frenzy of his remorse. So my speech came to me again."</p>
<p class="calibre4">All the man's genius for tragic acting, that genius which had made him unique in "Tristan" and in "Tannhauser," had been displayed in this recital; and its solitary auditor was more moved by it than superficially appeared. Neither of us spoke a word for a few minutes. Then Alresca, taking aim, threw the end of his cigar out of the window.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes," I said at length, "that was tragedy, that was!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">He proceeded:</p>
<p class="calibre4">"The critics are always praising me for the emotional qualities in my singing. Well, I cannot use my voice without thinking of the dreadful circumstance under which Fate saw fit to restore that which Fate had taken away."</p>
<p class="calibre4">And there fell a long silence, and night descended on the canal, and the swans were nothing now but pale ghosts wandering soundlessly over the water.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Carl," Alresca burst out with a start—he was decidedly in a mood to be communicative that evening—"have you ever been in love?"</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_112" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[112]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">In the gloom I could just distinguish that he was leaning his head on his arm.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"No," I answered; "at least, I think not;" and I wondered if I had been, if I was, in love.</p>
