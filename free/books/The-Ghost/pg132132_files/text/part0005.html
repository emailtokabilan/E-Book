<p class="calibre4">"Is Sullivan about?" I asked. I felt that if I was to speak I must not be interrupted by that good-natured worldling.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Sullivan," she said a little scornfully, with gentle contempt, "is learning French billiards. You are perfectly safe." She understood.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then I told her without the least reservation all that had happened to me, and especially my experiences of the previous night. When I had finished she looked at me with her large sombre eyes, which were full of pity, but not of hope. I waited for her words.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Now, listen," she said. "You shall hear. I was with Lord Clarenceux when he died."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You!" I exclaimed. "In Vienna! But even Rosa was not with him. How—"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Patience! And do not interrupt me with questions. I am giving away a secret which carries with it my—my reputation. Long before my marriage I had known Lord Clarenceux. He knew many women; I was one of them. That affair ended. I married Sullivan.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I happened to be in Vienna at the time Lord Clarenceux was taken with brain fever. I was performing at a music-hall on the Prater. There was a great rage then for English singers in Vienna. I knew he was alone. I <a id="Page_296" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[296]"></a>remembered certain things that had passed between us, and I went to him. I helped to nurse him. He was engaged to Rosa, but Rosa was far away, and could not come immediately. He grew worse. The doctors said one day that he must die. That night I was by his bedside. He got suddenly up out of bed. I could not stop him: he had the strength of delirium. He went into his dressing-room, and dressed himself fully, even to his hat, without any assistance.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"'Where are you going?' I said to him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"'I am going to her,' he said. 'These cursed doctors say I shall die. But I sha'n't. I want her. Why hasn't she come? I must go and find her.'</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Then he fell across the bed exhausted. He was dying. I had rung for help, but no one had come, and I ran out of the room to call on the landing. When I came back he was sitting up in bed, all dressed, and still with his hat on. It was the last flicker of his strength. His eyes glittered. He began to speak. How he stared at me! I shall never forget it!</p>
<p class="calibre4">"'I am dying!' he said hoarsely. 'They were right, after all. I shall lose her. I would sell my soul to keep her, yet death takes me <a id="Page_297" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[297]"></a>from her. She is young and beautiful, and will live many years. But I have loved her, and where I have loved let others beware. I shall never be far from her, and if another man should dare to cast eyes on her I will curse him. The heat of my jealousy shall blast his very soul. He, too, shall die. Rosa was mine in life, and she shall be mine in death. My spirit will watch over her, for no man ever loved a woman as I loved Rosa.' Those were his very words, Carl. Soon afterwards he died."</p>
<p class="calibre4">She recited Clarenceux's last phrases with such genuine emotion that I could almost hear Clarenceux himself saying them. I felt sure that she had remembered them precisely, and that Clarenceux would, indeed, have employed just such terms.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"And you believe," I murmured, after a long pause, during which I fitted the remarkable narration in with my experiences, and found that it tallied—"you believe that Lord Clarenceux could keep his word after death?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I believe!" she said simply.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Then there is no hope for me, Emmeline?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">She looked at me vaguely, absently, without speaking, and shook her head. Her lustrous eyes filled with tears.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00047" class="calibre3">THE INTERCESSION</h3>
<p class="calibre4">Just as I was walking away from the hotel I perceived Rosa's victoria drawing up before the portico. She saw me. We exchanged a long look—a look charged with anxious questionings. Then she beckoned to me, and I, as it were suddenly waking from a trance, raised my hat, and went to her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Get in," she said, without further greeting. "We will drive to the Arc de Triomphe and back. I was going to call on Mrs. Sullivan Smith,—just a visit of etiquette,—but I will postpone that."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her manner was constrained, as it had been on the previous day, but I could see that she was striving hard to be natural. For myself, I did not speak. I felt nervous, even irritable, in my love for her. Gradually, however, her presence soothed me, slackened the tension of <a id="Page_299" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[299]"></a>my system, and I was able to find a faint pleasure in the beauty of the September afternoon, and of the girl by my side, in the smooth movement of the carriage, and the general gaiety and color of the broad tree-lined Champs Elysées.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Why do you ask me to drive with you?" I asked her at length, abruptly yet suavely. Amid the noise of the traffic we could converse with the utmost privacy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Because I have something to say to you," she answered, looking straight in front of her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Before you say it, one question occurs to me. You are dressed in black; you are in mourning for Sir Cyril, your father, who is not even buried. And yet you told me just now that you were paying a mere visit of etiquette to my cousin Emmeline. Is it usual in Paris for ladies in mourning to go out paying calls? But perhaps you had a special object in calling on Emmeline."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I had," she replied at once with dignity, "and I did not wish you to know."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What was it?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Really, Mr. Foster—"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"'Mr. Foster!'"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes; I won't call you Carl any more. I <a id="Page_300" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[300]"></a>have made a mistake, and it is as well you should hear of it now. I can't love you. I have misunderstood my feelings. What I feel for you is gratitude, not love. I want you to forget me."</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was pale and restless.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Rosa!" I exclaimed warningly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes," she continued urgently and feverishly, "forget me. I may seem cruel, but it is best there should be no beating about the bush. I can't love you."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Rosa!" I repeated.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Go back to London," she went on. "You have ambitions. Fulfil them. Work at your profession. Above all, don't think of me. And always remember that though I am very grateful to you, I cannot love you—never!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"That isn't true, Rosa!" I said quietly. "You have invited me into this carriage simply to lie to me. But you are an indifferent liar—it is not your forte. My dear child, do you imagine that I cannot see through your poor little plan? Mrs. Sullivan Smith has been talking to you, and it has occurred to you that if you cast me off, the anger of that—that thing may be appeased, and I may be saved from the fate that overtook Alresca. <a id="Page_301" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[301]"></a>You were calling on Emmeline to ask her advice finally, as she appears to be mixed up in this affair. Then, on seeing me, you decided all of a sudden to take your courage in both hands, and dismiss me at once. It was heroic of you, Rosa; it was a splendid sacrifice of your self-respect. But it can't be. Nothing is going to disturb my love. If I die under some mysterious influence, then I die; but I shall die loving you, and I shall die absolutely certain that you love me."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her breast heaved, and under the carriage rug her hand found mine and clasped it. We did not look at each other. In a thick voice I called to the coachman to stop. I got out, and the vehicle passed on. If I had stayed with her, I should have wept in sight of the whole street.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I ate no dinner that evening, but spent the hours in wandering up and down the long verdurous alleys in the neighborhood of the Arc de Triomphe. I was sure of Rosa's love, and that thought gave me a certain invigoration. But to be sure of a woman's love when that love means torture and death to you is not a complete and perfect happiness. No, my heart was full of bitterness and despair, and my <a id="Page_302" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[302]"></a>mind invaded by a miserable weakness. I pitied myself, and at the same time I scorned myself. After all, the ghost had no actual power over me; a ghost cannot stab, cannot throttle, cannot shoot. A ghost can only act upon the mind, and if the mind is feeble enough to allow itself to be influenced by an intangible illusion, then—</p>
<p class="calibre4">But how futile were such arguments! Whatever the power might be, the fact that the ghost had indeed a power over me was indisputable. All day I had felt the spectral sword of it suspended above my head. My timid footsteps lingering on the way to the hotel sufficiently proved its power. The experiences of the previous night might be merely subjective—conceptions of the imagination—but they were no less real, no less fatal to me on that account.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Once I had an idea of not going to the hotel that night at all. But of what use could such an avoidance be? The apparition was bound by no fetters to that terrible sitting-room of mine. I might be put to the ordeal anywhere, even here in the thoroughfares of the city, and upon the whole I preferred to return to my <a id="Page_303" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[303]"></a>lodging. Nay, I was the victim of a positive desire for that scene of my torture.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I returned. It was eleven o'clock. The apparition awaited me. But this time it was not seated in the chair. It stood with its back to the window, and its gaze met mine as I entered the room. I did not close the door, and my eyes never left its face. The sneer on its thin lips was bitterer, more devilishly triumphant, than before. Erect, motionless, and inexorable, the ghost stood there, and it seemed to say: "What is the use of leaving the door open? You dare not escape. You cannot keep away from me. To-night you shall die of sheer terror."</p>
<p class="calibre4">With a wild audacity I sat down in the very chair which it had occupied, and drummed my fingers on the writing-table. Then I took off my hat, and with elaborate aim pitched it on to a neighboring sofa. I was making a rare pretence of carelessness. But moment by moment, exactly as before, my courage and resolution oozed out of me, drawn away by that mystic presence.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Once I got up filled with a brilliant notion. I would approach the apparition; I would try to touch it. Could I but do so, it would van<a id="Page_304" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[304]"></a>ish; I felt convinced it would vanish. I got up, as I say, but I did not approach the ghost. I was unable to move forward, held by a nameless dread. I dropped limply back into the chair. The phenomena of the first night repeated themselves, but more intensely, with a more frightful torture. Once again I sought relief from the agony of that gaze by retreating into the bedroom; once again I was compelled by the same indescribable fear to return, and once again I fell down, smitten by a new and more awful menace, a kind of incredible blasphemy which no human thought can convey.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And now the ghost moved mysteriously and ominously towards me. With an instinct of defence, cowed as I was upon the floor, I raised my hand to ward it off. Useless attempt! It came near and nearer, imperceptibly moving.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Let me die in peace," I said within my brain.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But it would not. Not only must I die, but in order to die I must traverse all the hideous tortures of the soul which that lost spirit had learnt in its dire wanderings.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The ghost stood over me, impending like a <a id="Page_305" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[305]"></a>doom. Then it suddenly looked towards the door, startled, and the door swung on its hinges. A girl entered—a girl dressed in black, her shoulders and bosom gleaming white against the dark attire, a young girl with the heavenliest face on this earth. Casting herself on her knees before the apparition, she raised to that dreadful spectre her countenance transfigured by the ecstasy of a sublime appeal. It was Rosa.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Can I describe what followed? Not adequately, only by imperfect hints. These two faced each other, Rosa and the apparition. She uttered no word. But I, in my stupor, knew that she was interceding with the spectre for my life. Her lovely eyes spoke to it of its old love, its old magnanimity, and in the name of that love and that magnanimity called upon it to renounce the horrible vengeance of which I was the victim.</p>
<p class="calibre4">For long the spectre gazed with stern and formidable impassivity upon the girl. I trembled, all hope and all despair, for the issue. She would not be vanquished. Her love was stronger than its hate; her love knew not the name of fear. For a thousand nights, so it seemed, the two remained thus, at grips, as it <a id="Page_306" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[306]"></a>were, in a death-struggle. Then with a reluctant gesture of abdication the ghost waved a hand; its terrible features softened into a consent, and slowly it faded away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I lay there Rosa bent over me, and put her arms round my neck, and I could feel on my face the caress of her hair, and the warm baptism of her tears—tears of joy.</p>
<hr class="c1"/>
<p class="calibre4">I raised her gently. I laid her on the sofa, and with a calm, blissful expectancy awaited the moment when her eyes should open. Ah! I may not set down here the sensation of relief which spread through my being as I realized with every separate brain-cell that I was no longer a victim, the doomed slave of an evil and implacable power, but a free man—free to live, free to love, exempt from the atrocious influences of the nether sphere. I saw that ever since the first encounter in Oxford Street my existence had been under a shadow, dark and malign and always deepening, and that this shadow was now magically dissipated in the exquisite dawn of a new day. And I gave thanks, not only to Fate, but to the divine girl who in one of those inspirations accorded only <a id="Page_307" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[307]"></a>to genius had conceived the method of my enfranchisement, and so nobly carried it out.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her eyelids wavered, and she looked at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It is gone?" she murmured.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes," I said, "the curse is lifted."</p>
<p class="calibre4">She smiled, and only our ardent glances spoke.</p>
<hr class="c1"/>
<p class="calibre4">"How came you to think of it?" I asked.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I was sitting in my room after dinner, thinking and thinking. And suddenly I could see this room, and you, and the spectre, as plainly as I see you now. I felt your terror; I knew every thought that was passing in your brain, the anguish of it! And then, and then, an idea struck me. I had never appealed in vain to Lord Clarenceux in life—why should I not appeal now? I threw a wrap over my shoulders and ran out. I didn't take a cab, I ran—all the way. I scarcely knew what I was doing, only that I had to save you. Oh, Carl, you are free!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Through you," I said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She kissed me, and her kiss had at once the pure passion of a girl and the satisfied solicitude of a mother.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Take me home!" she whispered.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_308" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[308]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">Outside the hotel an open carriage happened to be standing. I hailed the driver, and we got in. The night was beautifully fine and mild. In the narrow lane of sky left by the high roofs of the street the stars shone and twinkled with what was to me a new meaning. For I was once more in accord with the universe. I and Life were at peace again.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Don't let us go straight home," said Rosa, as the driver turned towards us for instructions. "It seems to me that a drive through Paris would be very enjoyable to-night."</p>
<p class="calibre4">And so we told the man to proceed along the quays as far as he could, and then through the Champs Elysées to the Bois de Boulogne. The Seine slept by its deserted parapets like a silver snake, and only the low rumble of the steam-car from Versailles disturbed its slumber. The million lights of the gas-lamps, stretching away now and then into the endless vistas of the boulevards, spoke to me of the delicious companionship of humanity, from which I had so nearly been snatched away. And the glorious girl by my side—what of her companionship? Ah, that was more than a companionship; it was a perfect intercourse which we shared. No two human beings ever <a id="Page_309" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[309]"></a>understood one another more absolutely, more profoundly, than did Rosa and myself, for we had been through the valley and through the flood together. And so it happened that we did not trouble much with conversation. It was our souls, not our mouths which talked—talked softly and mysteriously in the gracious stillness and obscurity of that Paris night. I learnt many things during that drive—the depth of her love, the height of her courage, the ecstasy of her bliss. And she, too, she must have learnt many things from me—the warmth of my gratitude to her, a warmth which was only exceeded by the transcendent fire of my affection.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Presently we had left the borders of the drowsy Seine, which is so busy by day, so strangely silent by night. We crossed the immense Place de la Concorde. Once again we were rolling smoothly along the Champs Elysées. Only a few hours before we had driven through this very avenue, Rosa and I, but with what different feelings from those which possessed us now! How serene and quiet it was! Occasionally a smooth-gliding carriage, or a bicyclist flitting by with a Chinese lantern at the head of his machine—<a id="Page_310" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[310]"></a>that was all. As we approached the summit of the hill where the Arc de Triomphe is, a new phenomenon awaited us. The moon rose—a lovely azure crescent over the houses, and its faint mild rays were like a benediction upon us. Then we had turned to the left, and were in the Bois de Boulogne. We stopped the carriage under the trees, which met overhead; the delicatest breeze stirred the branches to a crooning murmur. All around was solitude and a sort of hushed expectation. Suddenly Rosa put her hand into mine, and with a simultaneous impulse we got out of the carriage and strolled along a by-path.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Carl," she said, "I have a secret for you. But you must tell no one." She laughed mischievously.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What is it?" I answered, calmly smiling.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It is that I love you," and she buried her face against my shoulder.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Tell me that again," I said, "and again and again."</p>
<p class="calibre4">And so under the tall rustling trees we exchanged vows—vows made more sacred by the bitterness of our experience. And then at last, much to the driver's satisfaction, we returned to the carriage, and were driven back <a id="Page_311" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[311]"></a>to the Rue de Rivoli. I gave the man a twenty-franc piece; certainly the hour was unconscionably late.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I bade good night, a reluctant good night, to Rosa at the entrance to her flat.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Dearest girl," I said, "let us go to England to-morrow. You are almost English, you know; soon you will be the wife of an Englishman, and there is no place like London."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"True," she answered. "There is no place like London. We'll go. The Opéra Comique will manage without me. And I will accept no more engagements for a very, very long time. Money doesn't matter. You have enough, and I—oh, Carl, I've got stacks and piles of it. It's so easy, if you have a certain sort of throat like mine, to make more money than you can spend."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes," I said. "We will have a holiday, after we are married, and that will be in a fortnight's time. We will go to Devonshire, where the heather is. But, my child, you will be wanting to sing again soon. It is your life."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"No," she replied, "you are my life, aren't you?" And, after a pause: "But perhaps sing<a id="Page_312" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[312]"></a>ing is part of my life, too. Yes, I shall sing."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then I left her for that night, and walked slowly back to my hotel.</p>
