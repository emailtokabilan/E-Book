<p class="calibre4">He sighed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"No, Alresca," I said, surmising that he referred to his own case, "not everything, surely?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You are right," he replied. "Even then it is not everything. The human soul is unconquerable, even by love. But, nevertheless, be warned. Do not drive it late. Ah! Why should I not confess to you, now that all is over? Carl, you are aware that I have loved deeply. Can you guess what being in love meant to me? Probably not. I am aging now, but in my youth I was handsome, and I have had my voice. Women, the richest, the cleverest, the kindest—they fling themselves <a id="Page_113" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[113]"></a>at such as me. There is no vanity in saying so; it is the simple fact. I might have married a hundred times; I might have been loved a thousand times. But I remained—as I was. My heart slept like that of a young girl. I rejected alike the open advances of the bold and the shy, imperceptible signals of the timid. Women were not for me. In secret I despised them. I really believe I did.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Then—and it is not yet two years ago—I met her whom you know. And I—I the scorner, fell in love. All my pride, my self-assurance crumbled into ruin about me, and left me naked to the torment of an unrequited passion. I could not credit the depth of my misfortune, and at first it was impossible for me to believe that she was serious in refusing me. But she had the right. She was an angel, and I only a man. She was the most beautiful woman in the world."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"She was—she is," I said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He laughed easily.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"She is," he repeated. "But she is nothing to me. I admire her beauty and her goodness, that is all. She refused me. Good! At first I rebelled against my fate, then I ac<a id="Page_114" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[114]"></a>cepted it." And he repeated: "Then I accepted it."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I might have made some reply to his flattering confidences, but I heard some one walk quickly across the foot-path outside and through the wide entrance porch. In another moment the door of the salon was thrown open, and a figure stood radiant and smiling in the doorway. The antechamber had already been lighted, and the figure was silhouetted against the yellow radiance.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"So you are here, and I have found you, all in the dark!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">Alresca turned his head.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Rosa!" he cried in bewilderment, put out his arms, and then drew them sharply back again.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was Rosetta. She ran towards us, and shook hands with kind expressions of greeting, and our eyes followed her as she moved about, striking matches and applying them to candles. Then she took off her hat and veil.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"There! I seemed to know the house," she said. "Immediately I had entered the courtyard I felt that there was a corridor running to the right, and at the end of that corridor some steps and a landing and a door, and on <a id="Page_115" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[115]"></a>the other side of that door a large drawing-room. And so, without ringing or waiting for the faithful Alexis, I came in."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"And what brings you to Bruges, dear lady?" asked Alresca.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Solicitude for your health, dear sir," she replied, smiling. "At Bayreuth I met that quaint person, Mrs. Sullivan Smith, who told me that you were still here with Mr. Foster; and to-day, as I was travelling from Cologne to Ostend, the idea suddenly occurred to me to spend one night at Bruges, and make inquiries into your condition—and that of Mr. Foster. You know the papers have been publishing the most contradictory accounts."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Have they indeed?" laughed Alresca.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But I could see that he was nervous and not at ease. For myself, I was, it must be confessed, enchanted to see Rosa again, and so unexpectedly, and it was amazingly nice of her to include myself in her inquiries, and yet I divined that it would have been better if she had never come. I had a sense of some sort of calamity.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Alresca was flushed. He spoke in short, hurried sentences. Alternately his tones were passionate and studiously cold. Rosa's lovely <a id="Page_116" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[116]"></a>presence, her musical chatter, her gay laughter, filled the room. She seemed to exhale a delightful and intoxicating atmosphere, which spread itself through the chamber and enveloped the soul of Alresca. It was as if he fought against an influence, and then gradually yielded to the sweetness of it. I observed him closely—for was he not my patient?—and I guessed that a struggle was passing within him. I thought of what he had just been saying to me, and I feared lest the strong will should be scarcely so strong as it had deemed itself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You have dined?" asked Alresca.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I have eaten," she said. "One does not dine after a day's travelling."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Won't you have some coffee?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">She consented to the coffee, which Alexis John Smedley duly brought in, and presently she was walking lightly to and fro, holding the tiny white cup in her white hand, and peering at the furniture and bric-a-brac by the light of several candles. Between whiles she related to Alresca all the news of their operatic acquaintances—how this one was married, another stranded in Buenos Ayres, another ill with jealousy, another ill with a cold, <a id="Page_117" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[117]"></a>another pursued for debt, and so on through the diverting category.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"And Smart?" Alresca queried at length.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had been expecting and hoping for this question.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Oh, Sir Cyril! I have heard nothing of him. He is not a person that interests me."</p>
<p class="calibre4">She shut her lips tight and looked suddenly across in my direction, and our eyes met, but she made no sign that I could interpret. If she had known that the little jewelled dagger lay in the room over her head!</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her straw hat and thin white veil lay on a settee between two windows. She picked them up, and began to pull the pins out of the hat. Then she put the hat down again.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I must run away soon, Alresca," she said, bending over him, "but before I leave I should like to go through the whole house. It seems such a quaint place. Will you let Mr. Foster show me? He shall not be away from you long."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"In the dark?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Why not? We can have candles."</p>
<p class="calibre4">And so, a heavy silver candlestick in either hand, I presently found myself preceding Rosa up the wide branching staircase of the house. <a id="Page_118" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[118]"></a>We had left the owner with a reading-lamp at the head of his couch, and a copy of "Madame Bovary" to pass the time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We stopped at the first landing to examine a picture.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"That mysterious complaint that he had, or thought he had, in London has left him, has it not?" she asked me suddenly, in a low, slightly apprehensive, confidential tone, moving her head in the direction of the salon below.</p>
<p class="calibre4">For some reason I hesitated.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"He says so," I replied cautiously. "At any rate, he is much better."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes, I can see that. But he is still in a very nervous condition."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Ah," I said, "that is only—only at certain times."</p>
<p class="calibre4">As we went together from room to room I forgot everything except the fact of her presence. Never was beauty so powerful as hers; never was the power of beauty used so artlessly, with such a complete unconsciousness. I began gloomily to speculate on the chances of her ultimately marrying Alresca, and a remark from her awoke me from my abstraction. We were nearing the top of the house.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_119" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[119]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"It is all familiar to me, in a way," she said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Why, you said the same down-stairs. Have you been here before?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Never, to my knowledge."</p>
<p class="calibre4">We were traversing a long, broad passage side by side. Suddenly I tripped over an unexpected single stair, and nearly fell. Rosa, however, had allowed for it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I didn't see that step," I said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Nor I," she answered, "but I knew, somehow, that it was there. It is very strange and uncanny, and I shall insist on an explanation from Alresca." She gave a forced laugh.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I fumbled with the handle of the door she took hold of my hand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Listen!" she said excitedly, "this will be a small room, and over the mantelpiece is a little round picture of a dog."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I opened the door with something akin to a thrill. This part of the house was unfamiliar to me. The room was certainly a small one, but there was no little round picture over the mantelpiece. It was a square picture, and rather large, and a sea-piece.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You guessed wrong," I said, and I felt thankful.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_120" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[120]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"No, no, I am sure."</p>
<p class="calibre4">She went to the square picture, and lifted it away from the wall.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Look!" she said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Behind the picture was a round whitish mark on the wall, showing where another picture had previously hung.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Let us go, let us go! I don't like the flicker of these candles," she murmured, and she seized my arm.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We returned to the corridor. Her grip of me tightened.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Was not that Alresca?" she cried.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Where?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"At the end of the corridor—there!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I saw no one, and it couldn't have been he, for the simple reason that he can't walk yet, not to mention climbing three flights of stairs. You have made yourself nervous."</p>
<p class="calibre4">We descended to the ground-floor. In the main hall Alresca's housekeeper, evidently an old acquaintance, greeted Rosa with a curtsy, and she stopped to speak to the woman. I went on to the salon.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The aspect of the room is vividly before me now as I write. Most of the great chamber was in a candle-lit gloom, but the reading-<a id="Page_121" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[121]"></a>lamp burnt clearly at the head of the couch, throwing into prominence the fine profile of Alresca's face. He had fallen asleep, or at any rate his eyes were closed. The copy of "Madame Bovary" lay on the floor, and near it a gold pencil-case. Quietly I picked the book up, and saw on the yellow cover of it some words written in pencil. These were the words:</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Carl, I love her. He has come again. This time it is——"</p>
<p class="calibre4">I looked long at his calm and noble face, and bent and listened. At that moment Rosa entered. Concealing the book, I held out my right hand with a gesture.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Softly!" I enjoined her, and my voice broke.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Why? What?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"He is dead," I said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It did not occur to me that I ought to have prepared her.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00023" class="calibre3">THE VIGIL BY THE BIER</h3>
<p class="calibre4">We looked at each other, Rosa and I, across the couch of Alresca.</p>
<p class="calibre4">All the vague and terrible apprehensions, disquietudes, misgivings, which the gradual improvement in Alresca's condition had lulled to sleep, aroused themselves again in my mind, coming, as it were, boldly out into the open from the dark, unexplored grottos wherein they had crouched and hidden. And I went back in memory to those sinister days in London before I had brought Alresca to Bruges, days over which a mysterious horror had seemed to brood.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I felt myself adrift in a sea of frightful suspicions. I remembered Alresca's delirium on the night of his accident, and his final hallucination concerning the blank wall in the dressing-room (if hallucination it was), also on that night. I remembered his outburst <a id="Page_123" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[123]"></a>against Rosetta Rosa. I remembered Emmeline Smith's outburst against Rosetta Rosa. I remembered the vision in the crystal, and Rosa's sudden and astoundingly apt breaking in upon that vision. I remembered the scene between Rosa and Sir Cyril Smart, and her almost hysterical impulse to pierce her own arm with the little jewelled dagger. I remembered the glint of the dagger which drew my attention to it on the curb of an Oxford Street pavement afterwards. I remembered the disappearance of Sir Cyril Smart. I remembered all the inexplicable circumstances of Alresca's strange decay, and his equally strange recovery. I remembered that his recovery had coincided with an entire absence of communication between himself and Rosa.... And then she comes! And within an hour he is dead! "I love her. He has come again. This time it is—" How had Alresca meant to finish that sentence? "He has come again." Who had come again? Was there, then, another man involved in the enigma of this tragedy? Was it the man I had seen opposite the Devonshire Mansion on the night when I had found the dagger? Or was "he" merely an error for "she"? "I love her. She has come <a id="Page_124" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[124]"></a>again." That would surely make better sense than what Alresca had actually written? And he must have been mentally perturbed. Such a slip was possible. No, no! When a man, even a dying man, is writing a message which he has torn out of his heart, he does not put "he" for "she" ... "I love her...." Then, had he misjudged her heart when he confided in me during the early part of the evening? Or had the sudden apparition of Rosa created his love anew? Why had she once refused him? She seemed to be sufficiently fond of him. But she had killed him. Directly or indirectly she had been the cause of his death.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And as I looked at her, my profound grief for Alresca made me her judge. I forgot for the instant the feelings with which she had once inspired me, and which, indeed, had never died in my soul.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"How do you explain this?" I demanded of her in a calm and judicial and yet slightly hostile tone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Oh!" she exclaimed. "How sad it is! How terribly sad!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">And her voice was so pure and kind, and her glance so innocent, and her grief so pitiful, <a id="Page_125" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[125]"></a>that I dismissed forever any shade of a suspicion that I might have cherished against her. Although she had avoided my question, although she had ignored its tone, I knew with the certainty of absolute knowledge that she had no more concern in Alresca's death than I had.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She came forward, and regarded the corpse steadily, and took the lifeless hand in her hand. But she did not cry. Then she went abruptly out of the room and out of the house. And for several days I did not see her. A superb wreath arrived with her card, and that was all.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But the positive assurance that she was entirely unconnected with the riddle did nothing to help me to solve it. I had, however, to solve it for the Belgian authorities, and I did so by giving a certificate that Alresca had died of "failure of the heart's action." A convenient phrase, whose convenience imposes perhaps oftener than may be imagined on persons of an unsuspecting turn of mind! And having accounted for Alresca's death to the Belgian authorities, I had no leisure (save during the night) to cogitate much upon the mystery. For I was made immediately to <a id="Page_126" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[126]"></a>realize, to an extent to which I had not realized before, how great a man Alresca was, and how large he bulked in the world's eye.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The first announcement of his demise appeared in the "Etoile Belgi," the well-known Brussels daily, and from the moment of its appearance letters, telegrams, and callers descended upon Alresca's house in an unending stream. As his companion I naturally gave the whole of my attention to his affairs, especially as he seemed to have no relatives whatever. Correspondents of English, French, and German newspapers flung themselves upon me in the race for information. They seemed to scent a mystery, but I made it my business to discourage such an idea. Nay, I went further, and deliberately stated to them, with a false air of perfect candor, that there was no foundation of any sort for such an idea. Had not Alresca been indisposed for months? Had he not died from failure of the heart's action? There was no reason why I should have misled these excellent journalists in their search for the sensational truth, except that I preferred to keep the mystery wholly to myself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Those days after the death recur to me <a id="Page_127" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[127]"></a>now as a sort of breathless nightmare, in which, aided by the admirable Alexis, I was forever despatching messages and uttering polite phrases to people I had never seen before.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had two surprises, one greater and one less. In the first place, the Anglo-Belgian lawyer whom I had summoned informed me, after Alresca's papers had been examined and certain effects sealed in the presence of an official, that my friend had made a will, bearing a date immediately before our arrival in Bruges, leaving the whole of his property to me, and appointing me sole executor. I have never understood why Alresca did this, and I have always thought that it was a mere kind caprice on his part.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The second surprise was a visit from the Burgomaster of the city. He came clothed in his official robes. It was a call of the most rigid ceremony. Having condoled with me and also complimented me upon my succession to the dead man's estate, he intimated that the city desired a public funeral. For a moment I was averse to this, but as I could advance no argument against it I concurred in the proposal.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_128" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[128]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">There was a lying-in-state of the body at the cathedral, and the whole city seemed to go in mourning. On the second day a priest called at the house on the Quai des Augustins, and said that he had been sent by the Bishop to ask if I cared to witness the lying-in-state from some private vantage-ground. I went to the cathedral, and the Bishop himself escorted me to the organ-loft, whence I could see the silent crowds move slowly in pairs past Alresca's bier, which lay in the chancel. It was an impressive sight, and one which I shall not forget.</p>
<p class="calibre4">On the afternoon of the day preceding the funeral the same priest came to me again, and I received him in the drawing-room, where I was writing a letter to Totnes. He was an old man, a very old man, with a quavering voice, but he would not sit down.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It has occurred to the Lord Bishop," he piped, "that monsieur has not been offered the privilege of watching by the bier."</p>
<p class="calibre4">The idea startled me, and I was at a loss what to say.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"The Lord Bishop presents his profound regrets, and will monsieur care to watch?"</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_129" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[129]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">I saw at once that a refusal would have horrified the ecclesiastic.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I shall regard it as an honor," I said. "When?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"From midnight to two o'clock," answered the priest. "The later watches are arranged."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It is understood," I said, after a pause.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And the priest departed, charged with my compliments to the Lord Bishop.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had a horror of the duty which had been thrust upon me. It went against not merely my inclinations but my instincts. However, there was only one thing to do, and of course I did it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At five minutes to twelve I was knocking at the north door of the cathedral. A sacristan, who carried in his hand a long lighted taper, admitted me at once. Save for this taper and four candles which stood at the four corners of the bier, the vast interior was in darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The sacristan silently pointed to the chancel, and I walked hesitatingly across the gloomy intervening space, my footsteps echoing formidably in the silence. Two young priests stood, one at either side of the lofty bier. One of them bowed to me, and I took <a id="Page_130" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[130]"></a>his place. He disappeared into the ambulatory. The other priest was praying for the dead, a slight frown on his narrow white brow. His back was half-turned towards the corpse, and he did not seem to notice me in any way.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I folded my arms, and as some relief from the uncanny and troublous thoughts which ran in my head I looked about me. I could not bring myself to gaze on the purple cloth which covered the remains of Alresca. We were alone—the priest, Alresca, and I—and I felt afraid. In vain I glanced round, in order to reassure myself, at the stained-glass windows, now illumined by September starlight, at the beautiful carving of the choir-stalls, at the ugly rococo screen. I was afraid, and there was no disguising my fear.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suddenly the clock chimes of the belfry rang forth with startling resonance, and twelve o'clock struck upon the stillness. Then followed upon the bells a solemn and funereal melody.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"How comes that?" I asked the priest, without stopping to consider whether I had the right to speak during my vigil.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It is the carilloneur," my fellow watcher <a id="Page_131" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[131]"></a>said, interrupting his whispered and sibilant devotions, and turning to me, as it seemed, unwillingly. "Have you not heard it before? Every evening since the death he has played it at midnight in memory of Alresca." Then he resumed his office.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The minutes passed, or rather crawled by, and, if anything, my uneasiness increased. I suffered all the anxieties and tremors which those suffer who pass wakeful nights, imagining every conceivable ill, and victimized by the most dreadful forebodings. Through it all I was conscious of the cold of the stone floor penetrating my boots and chilling my feet....</p>
<p class="calibre4">The third quarter after one struck, and I began to congratulate myself that the ordeal by the bier was coming to an end. I looked with a sort of bravado into the dark, shadowed distances of the fane, and smiled at my nameless trepidations. And then, as my glance sought to penetrate the gloom of the great western porch, I grew aware that a man stood there. I wished to call the attention of the priest to this man, but I could not—I could not.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He came very quietly out of the porch, and <a id="Page_132" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[132]"></a>walked with hushed footfall up the nave; he mounted the five steps to the chancel; he approached us; he stood at the foot of the bier; he was within a yard of me. The priest had his back to him. The man seemed to ignore me; he looked fixedly at the bier. But I knew him. I knew that fine, hard, haughty face, that stiff bearing, that implacable eye. It was the man whom I had seen standing under the trees opposite the Devonshire Mansion in London.</p>
<p class="calibre4">For a few moments his countenance showed no emotion. Then the features broke into an expression of indescribable malice. With gestures of demoniac triumph he mocked the solemnity of the bier, and showered upon it every scornful indignity that the human face can convey.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I admit that I was spellbound with astonishment and horror. I ought to have seized the author of the infamous sacrilege—I ought, at any rate, to have called to the priest—but I could do neither. I trembled before this mysterious man. My frame literally shook. I knew what fear was. I was a coward.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At length he turned away, casting at me as <a id="Page_133" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[133]"></a>he did so one indefinable look, and with slow dignity passed again down the length of the nave and disappeared. Then, and not till then, I found my voice and my courage. I pulled the priest by the sleeve of his cassock.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Some one has just been in the cathedral," I said huskily. And I told him what I had seen.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Impossible! Retro me, Sathanas! It was imagination."</p>
<p class="calibre4">His tone was dry, harsh.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"No, no," I said eagerly. "I assure you...."</p>
<p class="calibre4">He smiled incredulously, and repeated the word "Imagination!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">But I well knew that it was not imagination, that I had actually seen this man enter and go forth.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00025" class="calibre3">THE MESSAGE</h3>
<p class="calibre4">When I returned to Alresca's house—or rather, I should say, to my own house—after the moving and picturesque ceremony of the funeral, I found a note from Rosetta Rosa, asking me to call on her at the Hôtel du Commerce. This was the first news of her that I had had since she so abruptly quitted the scene of Alresca's death. I set off instantly for the hotel, and just as I was going I met my Anglo-Belgian lawyer, who presented to me a large envelope addressed to myself in the handwriting of Alresca, and marked "private." The lawyer, who had been engaged in the sorting and examination of an enormous quantity of miscellaneous papers left by Alresca, informed me that he only discovered the package that very afternoon. I took the packet, put it in my pocket, and continued on my way to Rosa. It did not <a id="Page_135" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[135]"></a>occur to me at the time, but it occurred to me afterwards, that I was extremely anxious to see her again.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Everyone who has been to Bruges knows the Hôtel du Commerce. It is the Ritz of Bruges, and very well aware of its own importance in the scheme of things. As I entered the courtyard a waiter came up to me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Excuse me, monsieur, but we have no rooms."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Why do you tell me that?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Pardon. I thought monsieur wanted a room. Mademoiselle Rosa, the great diva, is staying here, and all the English from the Hôtel du Panier d'Or have left there in order to be in the same hotel with Mademoiselle Rosa."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Somewhere behind that mask of professional servility there was a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I do not want a room," I said, "but I want to see Mademoiselle Rosa."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Ah! As to that, monsieur, I will inquire." He became stony at once.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Stay. Take my card."</p>
<p class="calibre4">He accepted it, but with an air which implied that everyone left a card.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In a moment another servant came forth, <a id="Page_136" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[136]"></a>breathing apologies, and led me to Rosa's private sitting-room. As I went in a youngish, dark-eyed, black-aproned woman, who, I had no doubt, was Rosa's maid, left the room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rosa and I shook hands in silence, and with a little diffidence. Wrapped in a soft, black, thin-textured tea-gown, she reclined in an easy-chair. Her beautiful face was a dead white; her eyes were dilated, and under them were dark semicircles.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You have been ill," I exclaimed, "and I was not told."</p>
<p class="calibre4">She shrugged her shoulders in denial, and shivered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"No," she said shortly. There was a pause. "He is buried?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Let me hear about it."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wished to question her further about her health, but her tone was almost imperious, and I had a curious fear of offending her. Nevertheless I reminded myself that I was a doctor, and my concern for her urged me to be persistent.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"But surely you have been ill?" I said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She tapped her foot. It was the first symp<a id="Page_137" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[137]"></a>tom of nervous impatience that I had observed in her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Not in body," she replied curtly. "Tell me all about the funeral."</p>
<p class="calibre4">And I gave her an account of the impressive incidents of the interment—the stately procession, the grandiose ritual, the symbols of public grief. She displayed a strange, morbid curiosity as to it all.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And then suddenly she rose up from her chair, and I rose also, and she demanded, as it were pushed by some secret force to the limit of her endurance:</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You loved him, didn't you, Mr. Foster?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was not an English phrase; no Englishwoman would have used it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I was tremendously fond of him," I answered. "I should never have thought that I could have grown so fond of any one in such a short time. He wasn't merely fine as an artist; he was so fine as a man."</p>
<p class="calibre4">She nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You understood him? You knew all about him? He talked to you openly, didn't he?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes," I said. "He used to tell me all kinds of things."</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_138" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[138]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"Then explain to me," she cried out, and I saw that tears brimmed in her eyes, "why did he die when I came?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It was a coincidence," I said lamely.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Seizing my hands, she actually fell on her knees before me, flashing into my eyes all the loveliness of her pallid, upturned face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It was not a coincidence!" she passionately sobbed. "Why can't you be frank with me, and tell me how it is that I have killed him? He said long ago—do you not remember?—that I was fatal to him. He was getting better—you yourself said so—till I came, and then he died."</p>
<p class="calibre4">What could I reply? The girl was uttering the thoughts which had haunted me for days.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I tried to smile a reassurance, and raising her as gently as I could, I led her back to her chair. It was on my part a feeble performance.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You are suffering from a nervous crisis," I said, "and I must prescribe for you. My first prescription is that we do not talk about Alresca's death."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I endeavored to be perfectly matter-of-fact in tone, and gradually she grew calmer.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I have not slept since that night," she <a id="Page_139" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[139]"></a>murmured wearily. "Then you will not tell me?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What have I to tell you, except that you are ill? Stop a moment. I have an item of news, after all. Poor Alresca has made me his heir."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"That was like his kind heart."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes, indeed. But I can't imagine why he did it!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It was just gratitude," said she.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"A rare kind of gratitude," I replied.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Is no reason given in the will?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Not a word."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I remembered the packet which I had just received from the lawyer, and I mentioned it to her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Open it now," she said. "I am interested—if you do not think me too inquisitive."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I tore the envelope. It contained another envelope, sealed, and a letter. I scanned the letter.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It is nothing," I said with false casualness, and was returning it to my pocket. The worst of me is that I have no histrionic instinct; I cannot act a part.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Wait!" she cried sharply, and I hesitated before the appeal in her tragic voice. "You <a id="Page_140" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[140]"></a>cannot deceive me, Mr. Foster. It is something. I entreat you to read to me that letter. Does it not occur to you that I have the right to demand this from you? Why should he beat about the bush? You know, and I know that you know, that there is a mystery in this dreadful death. Be frank with me, my friend. I have suffered much these last days."</p>
<p class="calibre4">We looked at each other silently, I with the letter in my hand. Why, indeed, should I treat her as a child, this woman with the compelling eyes, the firm, commanding forehead? Why should I pursue the silly game of pretence?</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I will read it," I said. "There is, certainly, a mystery in connection with Alresca's death, and we may be on the eve of solving it."</p>
<p class="calibre4">The letter was dated concurrently with Alresca's will—that is to say, a few days before our arrival in Bruges—and it ran thus:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p class="calibre4">"My dear Friend:—It seems to me that I am to die, and from a strange cause—for I believe I have guessed the cause. The nature of my guess and all the circumstances I have written out at length, and the document <a id="Page_141" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[141]"></a>is in the sealed packet which accompanies this. My reason for making such a record is a peculiar one. I should desire that no eye might ever read that document. But I have an idea that some time or other the record may be of use to you—possibly soon. You, Carl, may be the heir of more than my goods. If matters should so fall out, then break the seal, and read what I have written. If not, I beg of you, after five years have elapsed, to destroy the packet unread. I do not care to be more precise.</p>
<p class="quotsig">Always yours,<br class="calibre1"/>
"Alresca."<br class="calibre1"/></p>
</div>
<p class="calibre4">"That is all?" asked Rosa, when I had finished reading it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I passed her the letter to read for herself. Her hand shook as she returned it to me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And we both blushed. We were both confused, and each avoided the glance of the other. The silence between us was difficult to bear. I broke it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"The question is, What am I to do? Alresca is dead. Shall I respect his wish, or shall I open the packet now? If he could have foreseen your anxiety, he probably would not have made these conditions. Be<a id="Page_142" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[142]"></a>sides, who can say that the circumstances he hints at have not already arisen? Who can say"—I uttered the words with an emphasis the daring of which astounded even myself—"that I am not already the heir of more than Alresca's goods?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">I imagined, after achieving this piece of audacity, that I was perfectly calm, but within me there must have raged such a tumult of love and dark foreboding that in reality I could scarcely have known what I was about.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rosa's eyes fixed themselves upon me, but I sustained that gaze. She stretched forth a hand as if to take the packet.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You shall decide," I said. "Am I to open it, or am I not to open it?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Open it," she whispered. "He will forgive us."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I began to break the seal.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"No, no!" she screamed, standing up again with clenched hands. "I was wrong. Leave it, for God's sake! I could not bear to know the truth."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I, too, sprang up, electrified by that terrible outburst. Grasping tight the envelope, I walked to and fro in the room, stamping on <a id="Page_143" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[143]"></a>the carpet, and wondering all the time (in one part of my brain) why I should be making such a noise with my feet. At length I faced her. She had not moved. She stood like a statue, her black tea-gown falling about her, and her two hands under her white drawn face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It shall be as you wish," I said. "I won't open it."</p>
<p class="calibre4">And I put the envelope back into my pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We both sat down.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Let us have some tea, eh?" said Rosa. She had resumed her self-control more quickly than I could. I was unable to answer her matter-of-fact remark. She rang the bell, and the maid entered with tea. The girl's features struck me; they showed both wit and cunning.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What splendid tea!" I said, when the refection was in progress. We had both found it convenient to shelter our feelings behind small talk. "I'd no idea you could get tea like this in Bruges."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You can't," Rosa smiled. "I never travel without my own brand. It is one of Yvette's special cares not to forget it."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Your maid?"</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_144" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[144]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"She seems not quite the ordinary maid," I ventured.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yvette? No! I should think not. She has served half the sopranos in Europe—she won't go to contraltos. I possess her because I outbid all rivals for her services. As a hairdresser she is unequalled. And it's so much nicer not being forced to call in a coiffeur in every town! It was she who invented my 'Elsa' coiffure. Perhaps you remember it?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Perfectly. By the way, when do you recommence your engagements?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">She smiled nervously. "I—I haven't decided."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Nothing with any particle of significance passed during the remainder of our interview. Telling her that I was leaving for England the next day, I bade good-by to Rosa. She did not express the hope of seeing me again, and for some obscure reason, buried in the mysteries of love's psychology, I dared not express the hope to her. And so we parted, with a thousand things unsaid, on a note of ineffectuality, of suspense, of vague indefiniteness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And the next morning I received from her <a id="Page_145" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[145]"></a>this brief missive, which threw me into a wild condition of joyous expectancy: "If you could meet me in the Church of St. Gilles at eleven o'clock this morning, I should like to have your advice upon a certain matter. —Rosa."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Seventy-seven years elapsed before eleven o'clock.</p>
<p class="calibre4">St. Gilles is a large church in a small deserted square at the back of the town. I waited for Rosa in the western porch, and at five minutes past the hour she arrived, looking better in health, at once more composed and vivacious. We sat down in a corner at the far end of one of the aisles. Except ourselves and a couple of cleaners, there seemed to be no one in the church.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You asked me yesterday about my engagements," she began.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes," I said, "and I had a reason. As a doctor, I will take leave to tell you that it is advisable for you to throw yourself into your work as soon as possible, and as completely as possible." And I remembered the similar advice which, out of the plenitude of my youthful wisdom, I had offered to Alresca only a few days before.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_146" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[146]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"The fact is that I have signed a contract to sing 'Carmen' at the Paris Opéra Comique in a fortnight's time. I have never sung the rôle there before, and I am, or rather I was, very anxious to do so. This morning I had a telegram from the manager urging me to go to Paris without delay for the rehearsals."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"And are you going?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"That is the question. I may tell you that one of my objects in calling on poor Alresca was to consult him about the point. The truth is, I am threatened with trouble if I appear at the Opéra Comique, particularly in 'Carmen.' The whole matter is paltry beyond words, but really I am a little afraid."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"May I hear the story?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You know Carlotta Deschamps, who always takes Carmen at the Comique?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I've heard her sing."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"By the way, that is her half-sister, Marie Deschamps, who sings in your cousin's operas at the London Diana."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I have made the acquaintance of Marie—a harmless little thing!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Her half-sister isn't quite so harmless. She is the daughter of a Spanish mother, <a id="Page_147" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[147]"></a>while Marie is the daughter of an English mother, a Cockney woman. As to Carlotta, when I was younger"—oh, the deliciously aged air with which this creature of twenty-three referred to her youth—"I was singing at the Opéra Comique in Paris, where Carlotta was starring, and I had the misfortune to arouse her jealousy. She is frightfully jealous, and get worse as she gets older. She swore to me that if I ever dared to appear at the Comique again she would have me killed. I laughed. I forgot the affair, but it happens that I never have sung at the Comique since that time. And now that I am not merely to appear at the Comique, but am going to sing 'Carmen' there, her own particular rôle, Deschamps is furious. I firmly believe she means harm. Twice she has written to me the most formidable threats. It seems strange that I should stand in awe of a woman like Carlotta Deschamps, but so it is. I am half-inclined to throw up the engagement."</p>
<p class="calibre4">That a girl of Rosa's spirit should have hesitated for an instant about fulfilling her engagement showed most plainly, I thought, that she was not herself. I assured her that <a id="Page_148" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[148]"></a>her fears were groundless, that we lived in the nineteenth century, and that Deschamps' fury would spend itself in nothing worse than threats. In the end she said she would reconsider the matter.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Don't wait to reconsider," I urged, "but set off for Paris at once. Go to-day. Act. It will do you good."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"But there are a hundred things to be thought of first," she said, laughing at my earnestness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"For example?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Well, my jewels are with my London bankers."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Can't you sing without jewels?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Not in Paris. Who ever heard of such a thing?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You can write to your bankers to send them by registered post."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Post! They are worth thousands and thousands of pounds. I ought really to fetch them, but there would scarcely be time."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Let me bring them to you in Paris," I said. "Give me a letter to your bankers, and I will undertake to deliver the jewels safely into your hands."</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_149" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[149]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"I could not dream of putting you to so much trouble."</p>
<p class="calibre4">The notion of doing something for her had, however, laid hold of me. At that moment I felt that to serve even as her jewel-carrier would be for me the supreme happiness in the world.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"But," I said, "I ask it as a favor."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Do you?" She gave me a divine smile, and yielded.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At her request we did not leave the church together. She preceded me. I waited a few minutes, and then walked slowly out. Happening to look back as I passed along the square, I saw a woman's figure which was familiar to me, and, dominated by a sudden impulse, I returned quickly on my steps. The woman was Yvette, and she was obviously a little startled when I approached her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Are you waiting for your mistress?" I said sharply. "Because...."</p>
<p class="calibre4">She flashed me a look.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Did monsieur by any chance imagine that I was waiting for himself?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">There was a calm insolence about the girl which induced me to retire from that parley.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In two hours I was on my way to London.</p>
<hr class="c"/>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_150" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[150]"></a></p>
<div class="calibre5"></div><div class="calibre5"></div><h2 id="pgepubid00026" class="calibre6"><a id="CHAPTER_IX" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre12"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00027" class="calibre3">THE TRAIN</h3>
<p class="calibre4">The boat-train was due to leave in ten minutes, and the platform at Victoria Station (how changed since then!) showed that scene of discreet and haughty excitement which it was wont to exhibit about nine o'clock every evening in those days. The weather was wild. It had been wet all day, and the rain came smashing down, driven by the great gusts of a genuine westerly gale. Consequently there were fewer passengers than usual, and those people who by choice or compulsion had resolved to front the terrors of the Channel passage had a preoccupied look as they hurried importantly to and fro amid piles of luggage and groups of loungers on the wind-swept platform beneath the flickering gas-lamps. But the porters, and the friends engaged in the ceremony of seeing-off, and the loungers, and the bookstall clerks—these individuals were not preoccupied by thoughts of intimate incon<a id="Page_151" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[151]"></a>veniences before midnight. As for me, I was quite alone with my thoughts. At least, I began by being alone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I was registering a particularly heavy and overfed portmanteau to Paris, a young woman put her head close to mine at the window of the baggage-office.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Mr. Foster? I thought it was. My cab set down immediately after yours, and I have been trying to catch your eye on the platform. Of course it was no go!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">The speech was thrown at me in a light, airy tone from a tiny, pert mouth which glistened red behind a muslin veil.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Miss Deschamps!" I exclaimed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Glad you remember my name. As handsome and supercilious as ever, I observe. I haven't seen you since that night at Sullivan's reception. Why didn't you call on me one Sunday? You know I asked you to."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Did you ask me?" I demanded, secretly flattered in the extremity of my youthfulness because she had called me supercilious.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Well, rather. I'm going to Paris—and in this weather!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I am, too."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Then, let's go together, eh?"</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_152" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[152]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"Delighted. But why have you chosen such a night?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I haven't chosen it. You see, I open to-morrow at the Casino de Paris for fourteen nights, and I suppose I've got to be there. You wouldn't believe what they're paying me. The Diana company is touring in the provinces while the theatre is getting itself decorated. I hate the provinces. Leeds and Liverpool and Glasgow—fancy dancing there! And so my half-sister—Carlotta, y'know—got me this engagement, and I'm going to stay with her. Have you met Carlotta?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"No—not yet." I did not add that I had had reason to think a good deal about her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Well, Carlotta is—Carlotta. A terrific swell, and a bit of a Tartar. We quarrel every time we meet, which isn't often. She tries to play the elder sister game on me, and I won't have it. Though she is elder—very much elder, you now. But I think her worst point is that she's so frightfully mysterious. You can never tell what she's up to. Now, a man I met at supper last night told me he thought he had seen Carlotta in Bloomsbury yesterday. However, I didn't believe that, because she is expecting me in Paris; we happen to be as thick <a id="Page_153" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[153]"></a>as thieves just now, and if she had been in London, she would have looked me up."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Just so," I replied, wondering whether I should endeavor to obtain from Marie Deschamps information which would be useful to Rosa.</p>
<p class="calibre4">By the time that the star of the Diana had said goodbye to certain male acquaintances, and had gone through a complicated dialogue with her maid on the subject of dress-trunks, the clock pointed almost to nine, and a porter rushed us—Marie and myself—into an empty compartment of a composite coach near to the engine. The compartment was first class, but it evidently belonged to an ancient order of rolling stock, and the vivacious Marie criticized it with considerable freedom. The wind howled, positively howled, in the station.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I wish I wasn't going," said the lady. "I shall be horribly ill."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You probably will," I said, to tease her, idly opening the Globe. "It seems that the morning steamer from Calais wasn't able to make either Dover or Folkestone, and has returned to Calais. Imagine the state of mind of the passengers!"</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_154" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[154]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"Ugh! Oh, Mr. Foster, what is that case by your side?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It is a jewel-case."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What a big one!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">She did not conceal her desire to see the inside of it, but I felt that I could not, even to satisfy her charming curiosity, expose the interior of Rosa's jewel-case in a railway carriage, and so I edged away from the topic with as much adroitness as I was capable of.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The pretty girl pouted, and asked me for the Globe, behind which she buried herself. She kept murmuring aloud extracts from the Globe's realistic description of the weather, and then she jumped up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I'm not going."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Not going?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"No. The weather's too awful. These newspaper accounts frighten me."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"But the Casino de Paris?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"A fig for it! They must wait for me, that's all. I'll try again to-morrow. Will you mind telling the guard to get my boxes out, there's a dear Mr. Foster, and I'll endeavor to find that maid of mine?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">The train was already five minutes late in starting; she delayed it quite another five <a id="Page_155" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[155]"></a>minutes, and enjoyed the process. And it was I who meekly received the objurgations of porters and guard. My reward was a smile, given with a full sense of its immense value.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Good-by, Mr. Foster. Take care of your precious jewel-case."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had carried the thing in my hand up and down the platform. I ran to my carriage, and jumped in breathless as the train whistled.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Pleasant journey!" the witch called out, waving her small hand to me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I bowed to her from the window, laughing. She was a genial soul, and the incident had not been without amusement.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After I had shut the carriage door, and glanced out of the window for a moment in the approved way, I sank, faintly smiling at the episode, into my corner, and then I observed with a start that the opposite corner was occupied. Another traveller had got into the compartment while I had been coursing about the platform on behalf of Marie, and that traveller was the mysterious and sinister creature whom I had met twice before—once in Oxford Street, and once again during the night watch in the cathedral at Bruges. He must have made up his mind to travel rather sud<a id="Page_156" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[156]"></a>denly, for, in spite of the weather, he had neither overcoat nor umbrella—merely the frock coat and silk hat of Piccadilly. But there was no spot of rain on him, and no sign of disarray.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I gazed with alarmed eyes into the face of that strange, forbidding personality, the gaiety of my mood went out like a match in a breeze. The uncomfortable idea oppressed me that I was being surely caught and enveloped in a net of adverse circumstances, that I was the unconscious victim of a deep and terrible conspiracy which proceeded slowly forward to an inevitable catastrophe. On each of the previous occasions when this silent and malicious man had crossed my path I had had the same feeling, but in a less degree, and I had been able to shake it off almost at once. But now it overcame and conquered me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The train thundered across Grosvenor Bridge through the murky weather on its way to the coast, and a hundred times I cursed it for its lack of speed. I would have given much to be at the journey's end, and away from this motionless and inscrutable companion. His eyes were constantly on my face, and do what I would I could not appear at ease. I <a id="Page_157" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[157]"></a>tried to read the paper, I pretended to sleep, I hummed a tune, I even went so far as to whistle, but my efforts at sang-froid were ridiculous. The worst of it was that he was aware of my despicable condition; his changeless cynical smile made that fact obvious to me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At last I felt that something must happen. At any rate, the silence of the man must be broken. And so I gathered together my courage, and with a preposterous attempt at a friendly smile remarked:</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Beastly weather we're having. One would scarcely expect it so early in September."</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was an inane speech, so commonplace, so entirely foolish. And the man ignored it absolutely. Only the corners of his lips drooped a little to express, perhaps, a profounder degree of hate and scorn.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This made me a little angry.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Didn't I see you last in the cathedral at Bruges?" I demanded curtly, even rudely.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He laughed. And his laugh really alarmed me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The train stopped at that moment at a dark and deserted spot, which proved to be Sittingbourne. I hesitated, and then, giving up the struggle, sped out of the compartment, and <a id="Page_158" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[158]"></a>entered another one lower down. My new compartment was empty. The sensation of relief was infinitely soothing. Placing the jewel-case carefully on my knees, I breathed freely once more, and said to myself that another quarter of an hour of that detestable presence would have driven me mad.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I began to think about Rosetta Rosa. As a solace after the exasperating companionship of that silent person in the other compartment, I invited from the back of my mind certain thoughts about Rosetta Rosa which had been modestly waiting for me there for some little time, and I looked at them fairly, and turned them over, and viewed them from every side, and derived from them a rather thrilling joy. The fact is, I was beginning to be in love with Rosa. Nay, I was actually in love with her. Ever since our first meeting my meditations had been more or less busy with her image. For a long period, largely owing to my preoccupation with Alresca, I had dreamed of her but vaguely. And now, during our interviews at her hotel and in the church of St. Gilles, she had, in the most innocent way in the world, forged fetters on me which I had no desire to shake off.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_159" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[159]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a presumption on my part. I acknowledged frankly that it was a presumption. I was a young doctor, with nothing to distinguish me from the ruck of young doctors. And she was—well, she was one of those rare and radiant beings to whom even monarchs bow, and the whole earth offers the incense of its homage.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Which did not in the least alter the fact that I was in love with her. And, after all, she was just a woman; more, she was a young woman. And she had consulted me! She had allowed me to be of use to her! And, months ago in London, had she not permitted me to talk to her with an extraordinary freedom? Lovely, incomparable, exquisite as she was, she was nevertheless a girl, and I was sure that she had a girl's heart.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, it was a presumption.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I remembered her legendary engagement to Lord Clarenceux, an engagement which had interested all Europe. I often thought of that matter. Had she loved him—really loved him? Or had his love for her merely flattered her into thinking that she loved him? Would she not be liable to institute comparisons be<a id="Page_160" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[160]"></a>tween myself and that renowned, wealthy, and gifted nobleman?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, I did not care if she did. Such is the egoism of untried love that I did not care if she did! And I lapsed into a reverie—a reverie in which everything went smoothly, everything was for the best in the best of all possible worlds, and only love and love's requital existed....</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, in the fraction of a second, as it seemed, there was a grating, a horrible grind of iron, a bump, a check, and my head was buried in the cushions of the opposite side of the carriage, and I felt stunned—not much, but a little.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What—what?" I heard myself exclaim. "They must have plumped the brakes on pretty sudden."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, quite after an interval, it occurred to me that this was a railway accident—one of those things that one reads of in the papers with so much calmness. I wondered if I was hurt, and why I could hear no sound; the silence was absolute—terrifying.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In a vague, aimless way, I sought for my matchbox, and struck a light. I had just time to observe that both windows were smashed, <a id="Page_161" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[161]"></a>and the floor of the compartment tilted, when the match went out in the wind. I had heard no noise of breaking glass.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I stumbled slowly to the door, and tried to open it, but the thing would not budge. Whereupon I lost my temper.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Open, you beast, you beast, you beast!" I cried to the door, kicking it hard, and yet not feeling the impact.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then another thought—a proud one, which served to tranquillize me: "I am a doctor, and they will want me to attend to the wounded."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I remembered my flask, and unscrewing the stopper with difficulty, clutched the mouth with my teeth and drank. After that I was sane and collected. Now I could hear people tramping on the ground outside, and see the flash of lanterns. In another moment a porter, whose silver buttons gleamed in the darkness, was pulling me through the window.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Hurt?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"No, not I. But if any one else is, I'm a doctor."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Here's a doctor, sir," he yelled to a gray-headed man near by. Then he stood still, wondering what he should do next. I per<a id="Page_162" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[162]"></a>ceived in the near distance the lights of a station.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Is that Dover?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"No, sir; Dover Priory. Dover's a mile further on. There was a goods wagon got derailed on the siding just beyond the home signal, and it blocked the down line, and the driver of the express ran right into it, although the signal was against him—ran right into it, 'e did."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Other people were crawling out of the carriages now, and suddenly there seemed to be scores of spectators, and much shouting and running about. The engine lay on its side, partly overhanging a wrecked wagon. Immense clouds of steam issued from it, hissing above the roar of the wind. The tender was twisted like a patent hairpin in the middle. The first coach, a luggage-van, stood upright, and seemed scarcely damaged. The second coach, the small, old-fashioned vehicle which happily I had abandoned at Sittingbourne, was smashed out of resemblance to a coach. The third one, from which I had just emerged, looked fairly healthy, and the remaining three had not even left the rails.</p>
<p class="calibre4">All ran to the smashed coach.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_163" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[163]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"There were two passengers in that coach," said the guard, who, having been at the rear of the train, was unharmed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Are you counting me?" I asked. "Because I changed carriages at Sittingbourne."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Praise God for that, sir!" he answered. "There's only one, then—a tall, severe-looking gent—in the first-class compartment."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Was it joy or sorrow that I felt at the thought of that man buried somewhere in the shapeless mass of wood and iron? It certainly was not unmixed sorrow. On the contrary, I had a distinct feeling of elation at the thought that I was probably rid forever of this haunter of my peace, this menacing and mysterious existence which (if instinctive foreboding was to be trusted) had been about to cross and thwart and blast my own.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The men hammered and heaved and chopped and sawed, and while they were in the midst of the work some one took me by the sleeve and asked me to go and attend to the engine-driver and stoker, who were being carried into a waiting-room at the station. It is symptomatic of the extraordinary confusion which reigns in these affairs that till that moment the question of the fate of the men in charge <a id="Page_164" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[164]"></a>of the train had not even entered my mind, though I had of course noticed that the engine was overturned. In the waiting-room it was discovered that two local doctors had already arrived. I preferred to leave the engine-driver to them. He was unconscious as he lay on a table. The stoker, by his side, kept murmuring in a sort of delirium:</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Bill, 'e was all dazed like—'e was all dazed like. I told him the signal wasn't off. I shouted to him. But 'e was all dazed like."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I returned to the train full of a horrible desire to see with my own eyes a certain corpse. Bit by bit the breakdown gang had removed the whole of the centre part of the shattered carriage. I thrust myself into the group, and—we all looked at each other. Nobody, alive or dead, was to be found.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"He, too, must have got out at Sittingbourne," I said at length.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Ay!" said the guard.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My heard swam, dizzy with dark imaginings and unspeakable suspicions. "He has escaped; he is alive!" I muttered savagely, hopelessly. It was as if a doom had closed inevitably over me. But if my thoughts had been legible and I had been asked to explain <a id="Page_165" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[165]"></a>this attitude of mine towards a person who had never spoken to me, whom I had seen but thrice, and whose identity was utterly unknown, I could not have done so. I had no reasons. It was intuition.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Abruptly I straightened myself, and surveying the men and the background of ruin lighted by the fitful gleams of lanterns and the pale glitter of a moon half-hidden by flying clouds, I shouted out:</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I want a cab. I have to catch the Calais boat. Will somebody please direct me!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">No one appeared even to hear me. The mental phenomena which accompany a railway accident, even a minor one such as this, are of the most singular description. I felt that I was growing angry again. I had a grievance because not a soul there seemed to care whether I caught the Calais boat or not. That, under the unusual circumstances, the steamer would probably wait did not occur to me. Nor did I perceive that there was no real necessity for me to catch the steamer. I might just as well have spent the night at the Lord Warden, and proceeded on my journey in the morning. But no! I must hurry away instantly!</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_166" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[166]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">Then I thought of the jewel-box.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Where's my jewel-box?" I demanded vehemently from the guard, as though he had stolen it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He turned to me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What's that you're carrying?" he replied.</p>
<p class="calibre4">All the time I had been carrying the jewel-box. At the moment of the collision I must have instinctively clutched it, and my grasp had not slackened. I had carried it to the waiting-room and back without knowing that I was doing so!</p>
<p class="calibre4">This sobered me once more. But I would not stay on the scene. I was still obsessed by the desire to catch the steamer. And abruptly I set off walking down the line. I left the crowd and the confusion and the ruin, and hastened away bearing the box.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I think that I must have had no notion of time, and very little notion of space. For I arrived at the harbour without the least recollection of the details of my journey thither. I had no memory of having been accosted by any official of the railway, or even of having encountered any person at all. Fortunately it had ceased to rain, and the wind, though still strong, was falling rapidly.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_167" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[167]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">Except for a gatekeeper, the bleak, exposed pier had the air of being deserted. The lights of the town flickered in the distance, and above them rose dimly the gaunt outlines of the fortified hills. In front was the intemperate and restless sea. I felt that I was at the extremity of England, and on the verge of unguessed things. Now, I had traversed about half the length of the lonely pier, which seems to curve right out into the unknown, when I saw a woman approaching me in the opposite direction. My faculties were fatigued with the crowded sensations of that evening, and I took no notice of her. Even when she stopped to peer into my face I thought nothing of it, and put her gently aside, supposing her to be some dubious character of the night hours. But she insisted on speaking to me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You are Carl Foster," she said abruptly. The voice was harsh, trembling, excited, yet distinguished.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Suppose I am?" I answered wearily. How tired I was!</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I advise you not to go to Paris."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I began to arouse my wits, and I became aware that the woman was speaking with a strong French accent. I searched her face, <a id="Page_168" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[168]"></a>but she wore a thick veil, and in the gloom of the pier I could only make out that she had striking features, and was probably some forty years of age. I stared at her in silence.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I advise you not to go to Paris," she repeated.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Who are you?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Never mind. Take my advice."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Why? Shall I be robbed?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Robbed!" she exclaimed, as if that was a new idea to her. "Yes," she said hurriedly. "Those jewels might be stolen."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"How do you know that I have jewels?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Ah! I—I saw the case."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Don't trouble yourself, madam; I shall take particular care not to be robbed. But may I ask how you have got hold of my name?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had vague ideas of an ingenious plan for robbing me, the particulars of which this woman was ready to reveal for a consideration.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She ignored my question.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Listen!" she said quickly. "You are going to meet a lady in Paris. Is it not so?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I must really—"</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_169" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[169]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"Take advice. Move no further in that affair."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I attempted to pass her, but she held me by the sleeve. She went on with emphasis:</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Rosetta Rosa will never be allowed to sing in 'Carmen' at the Opéra Comique. Do you understand?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Great Scott!" I said, "I believe you must be Carlotta Deschamps."</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a half-humorous inspiration on my part, but the remark produced an immediate effect on the woman, for she walked away with a highly theatrical scowl and toss of the head. I recalled what Marie Deschamps had said in the train about her stepsister, and also my suspicion that Rosa's maid was not entirely faithful to her mistress—spied on her, in fact; and putting the two things together, it occurred to me that this strange lady might actually be Carlotta.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Many women of the stage acquire a habitual staginess and theatricality, and it was quite conceivable that Carlotta had relations with Yvette, and that, ridden by the old jealousy which had been aroused through the announcement of Rosa's return to the Opéra Comique, she was setting herself in an indefi<a id="Page_170" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[170]"></a>nite, clumsy, stealthy, and melodramatic manner to prevent Rosa's appearance in "Carmen."</p>
<p class="calibre4">No doubt she had been informed of Rosa's conference with me in the church of St. Gilles, and, impelled by some vague, obscure motive, had travelled to London to discover me, and having succeeded, was determined by some means to prevent me from getting into touch with Rosa in Paris. So I conjectured roughly, and subsequent events indicated that I was not too far wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I laughed. The notion of the middle-aged prima donna going about in waste places at dead of night to work mischief against a rival was indubitably comic. I would make a facetious narrative of the meeting for the amusement of Rosa at breakfast to-morrow in Paris. Then, feeling all at once at the end of my physical powers, I continued my way, and descended the steps to the Calais boat.</p>
<p class="calibre4">All was excitement there. Had I heard of the railway accident? Yes, I had. I had been in it. Instantly I was surrounded by individuals who raked me fore and aft with questions. I could not endure it; my nervous energy, I realized, was exhausted, and having <a id="Page_171" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[171]"></a>given a brief outline of the disaster, I fled down the saloon stairs.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My sole desire was to rest; the need of unconsciousness, of forgetfulness, was imperious upon me; I had had too many experiences during the last few hours. I stretched myself on the saloon cushions, making a pillow of the jewel-box.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Shall we start soon?" I murmured to a steward.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes, sir, in another five minutes. Weather's moderating, sir."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Other passengers were in the saloon, and more followed. As this would be the first steamer to leave Dover that day, there was a good number of voyagers on board, in spite of adverse conditions. I heard people talking, and the splash of waves against the vessel's sides, and then I went to sleep. Nothing could have kept me awake.</p>
