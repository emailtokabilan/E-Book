<h3 id="pgepubid00029" class="calibre3">THE STEAMER</h3>
<p class="calibre4">I awoke with a start, and with wavering eyes looked at the saloon clock. I had slept for one hour only, but it appeared to me that I was quite refreshed. My mind was strangely clear, every sense preternaturally alert. I began to wonder what had aroused me. Suddenly the ship shuddered through the very heart of her, and I knew that it was this shuddering, which must have occurred before, that had wakened me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Good God! We're sinking!" a man cried. He was in the next berth to me, and he sat up, staring wildly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Rubbish!" I answered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The electric lights went out, and we were left with the miserable illumination of one little swinging oil-lamp. Immediately the score or so persons in the saloon were afoot and rushing about, grasping their goods and <a id="Page_173" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[173]"></a>chattels. The awful shuddering of the ship continued. Scarcely a word was spoken.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A man flew, or rather, tumbled, down the saloon stairs, shouting: "Where's my wife? Where's my wife?" No one took the slightest notice of him, nor did he seem to expect any answer. Even in the semi-darkness of the single lamp I distinctly saw that with both hands he was tearing handfuls of hair from his head. I had heard the phrase "tearing one's hair" some thousands of time in my life, but never till that moment had I witnessed the action itself. Somehow it made an impression on me. The man raced round the saloon still shouting, and raced away again up-stairs and out of sight. Everyone followed him pell-mell, helter-skelter, and almost in a second I found myself alone. I put on my overcoat, and my mackintosh over that, and seizing Rosa's jewel-box, I followed the crowd.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I emerged on deck a Bengal light flared red and dazzling on the bridge, and I saw some sailors trying to lower a boat from its davits. Then I knew that the man who had cried "We're sinking!" even if he was not speaking the exact truth, had at any rate some grounds for his assertion.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_174" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[174]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">A rather pretty girl, pale with agitation, seized me by the buttonhole.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Where are we going?" she questioned earnestly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Don't know, madam," I replied; and then a young man dragged her off by the arm.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Come this way, Lottie," I heard him say to her, "and keep calm."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was left staring at the place where the girl's head had been. Then the head of an old man filled that place. I saw his mouth and all his features working in frantic endeavor to speak to me, but he could not articulate. I stepped aside; I could not bear to look at him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Carl," I said to myself, "you are undoubtedly somewhat alarmed, but you are not in such an absolutely azure funk as that old chap. Pull yourself together."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Of what followed immediately I have no recollection. I knew vaguely that the ship rolled and had a serious list to starboard, that orders were being hoarsely shouted from the bridge, that the moon was shining fitfully, that the sea was black and choppy; I also seemed to catch the singing of a hymn somewhere on the forward deck. I suppose I knew that I existed. But that was all. I had no exact <a id="Page_175" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[175]"></a>knowledge of what I myself was doing. There was a hiatus in my consciousness of myself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The proof of this is that, after a lapse of time, I suddenly discovered that I had smoked half-way through a cigarette, and that I was at the bows of the steamer. For a million sovereigns I could not explain under what circumstances I had moved from one end of the ship to the other, nor how I had come to light that cigarette. Such is the curious effect of perturbation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But the perturbation had now passed from me, just as mysteriously as it had overtaken me. I was cool and calm. I felt inquisitive, and I asked several people what had happened. But none seemed to know. In fact, they scarcely heard me, and answered wildly, as if in delirium. It seemed strange that anything could have occurred on so small a vessel without the precise details being common property. Yet so it was, and those who have been in an accident at sea will support me when I say that the ignorance on the part of the passengers of the events actually in progress is not the least astounding nor the least disconcerting item in such an affair. It was the psychology of the railway accident repeated.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_176" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[176]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">I began to observe. The weather was a little murky, but beyond doubt still improving. The lights of the French coast could clearly be seen. The ship rolled in a short sea; her engines had stopped; she still had the formidable list to starboard; the captain was on the bridge, leaning over, and with his hands round his mouth was giving orders to an officer below. The sailors were still struggling to lower the boat from the davits. The passengers stood about, aimless, perhaps terror-struck, but now for the most part quiet and self-contained. Some of them had life-belts. That was the sum of my observations.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A rocket streamed upwards into the sky, and another and another, then one caught the rigging, and, deflected, whizzed down again within a few feet of my head, and dropped on deck, spluttering in a silly, futile way. I threw the end of my cigarette at it to see whether that might help it along.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"So this is a shipwreck," I ejaculated. "And I'm in it. I've got myself safely off the railway only to fall into the sea. What a d——d shame!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">Queerly enough, I had ceased to puzzle myself with trying to discover how the disaster <a id="Page_177" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[177]"></a>had been brought about. I honestly made up my mind that we were sinking, and that was sufficient.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What cursed ill-luck!" I murmured philosophically.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I thought of Rosa, with whom I was to have breakfasted on the morrow, whose jewels I was carrying, whose behest it had been my pleasure to obey. At that moment she seemed to me in my mind's eye more beautiful, of a more exquisite charm, than ever before. "Am I going to lose her?" I murmured. And then: "What a sensation there'll be in the papers if this ship does go down!" My brain flitted from point to point in a quick agitation. I decided suddenly that the captain and crew must be a set of nincompoops, who had lost their heads, and, not knowing what to do, were unserenely doing nothing. And quite as suddenly I reversed my decision, and reflected that no doubt the captain was doing precisely the correct thing, and that the crew were loyal and disciplined.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then my mind returned to Rosa. What would she say, what would she feel, when she learnt that I had been drowned in the Channel? Would she experience a grief merely <a id="Page_178" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[178]"></a>platonic, or had she indeed a profounder feeling towards me? Drowned! Who said drowned? There were the boats, if they could be launched, and, moreover, I could swim. I considered what I should do at the moment the ship foundered—for I still felt she would founder. I was the blackest of pessimists. I said to myself that I would spring as far as I could into the sea, not only to avoid the sucking in of the vessel, but to get clear of the other passengers.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suppose that a passenger who could not swim should by any chance seize me in the water, how should I act? This was a conundrum. I could not save another and myself, too. I said I would leave that delicate point till the time came, but in my heart I knew that I should beat off such a person with all the savagery of despair—unless it happened to be a woman. I felt that I could not repulse a drowning woman, even if to help her for a few minutes meant death for both of us.</p>
<p class="calibre4">How insignificant seemed everything else—everything outside the ship and the sea and our perilous plight! The death of Alresca, the jealousy of Carlotta Deschamps, the plot (if there was one) against Rosa—what were <a id="Page_179" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[179]"></a>these matters to me? But Rosa was something. She was more than something; she was all. A lovely, tantalizing vision of her appeared to float before my eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I peered over the port rail to see whether we were in fact gradually sinking. The heaving water looked a long way off, and the idea of this raised my spirits for an instant. But only for an instant. The apparent inactivity of those in charge annoyed while it saddened me. They were not even sending up rockets now, nor burning Bengal lights. I had no patience left to ask more questions. A mood of disgust seized me. If the captain himself had stood by my side waiting to reply to requests for information, I doubt if I should have spoken. I felt like the spectator who is compelled to witness a tragedy which both wounds and bores him. I was obsessed by my own ill-luck and the stupidity of the rest of mankind. I was particularly annoyed by the spasmodic hymn-singing that went on in various parts of the deck.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The man who had burst into the saloon shouting "Where is my wife?" reappeared from somewhere, and standing near to me started to undress hastily. I watched him. <a id="Page_180" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[180]"></a>He had taken off his coat, waistcoat, and boots, when a quiet, amused voice said: "I shouldn't do that if I were you. It's rather chilly, you know. Besides, think of the ladies."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Without a word he began with equal celerity to reassume his clothes. I turned to the speaker. It was the youth who had dragged the girl away from me when I first came up on deck. She was on his arm, and had a rug over her head. Both were perfectly self-possessed. The serenity of the young man's face particularly struck me. I was not to be out-done.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Have a cigarette?" I said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Thanks."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Do you happen to know what all this business is?" I asked him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It's a collision," he said. "We were struck on the port paddle-box. That saved us for the moment."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"How did it occur?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Don't know."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"And where's the ship that struck us?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Oh, somewhere over there—two or three miles away." He pointed vaguely to the northeast. "You see, half the paddle-wheel <a id="Page_181" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[181]"></a>was knocked off, and when that sank, of course the port side rose out of the water. I believe those paddle-wheels weigh a deuce of a lot."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Are we going to sink?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Don't know. Can tell you more in half an hour. I've got two life-belts hidden under a seat. They're rather a nuisance to carry about. You're shivering, Lottie. We must take some more exercise. See you later, sir."</p>
<p class="calibre4">And the two went off again. The girl had not looked at me, nor I at her. She did not seem to be interested in our conversation. As for her companion, he restored my pride in my race.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I began to whistle. Suddenly the whistle died on my lips. Standing exactly opposite to me, on the starboard side, was the mysterious being whom I had last seen in the railway carriage at Sittingbourne. He was, as usual, imperturbable, sardonic, terrifying. His face, which chanced to be lighted by the rays of a deck lantern, had the pallor and the immobility of marble, and the dark eyes held me under their hypnotic gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Again I had the sensation of being victimized by a conspiracy of which this implacable man was the head. I endured once more the <a id="Page_182" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[182]"></a>mental tortures which I had suffered in the railway carriage, and now, as then, I felt helpless and bewildered. It seemed to me that his existence overshadowed mine, and that in some way he was connected with the death of Alresca. Possibly there was a plot, in which the part played by the jealousy of Carlotta Deschamps was only a minor one. Possibly I had unwittingly stepped into a net of subtle intrigue, of the extent of whose boundaries and ramifications I had not the slightest idea. Like one set in the blackness of an unfamiliar chamber, I feared to step forward or backward lest I might encounter some unknown horror.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It may be argued that I must have been in a highly nervous condition in order to be affected in such a manner by the mere sight of a man—a man who had never addressed to me a single word of conversation. Perhaps so. Yet up to that period of my life my temperament and habit of mind had been calm, unimpressionable, and if I may say so, not specially absurd.</p>
<p class="calibre4">What need to inquire how the man had got on board that ship—how he had escaped death in the railway accident—how he had <a id="Page_183" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[183]"></a>eluded my sight at Dover Priory? There he stood. Evidently he had purposed to pursue me to Paris, and little things like railway collisions were insufficient to deter him. I surmised that he must have quitted the compartment at Sittingbourne immediately after me, meaning to follow me, but that the starting of the train had prevented him from entering the same compartment as I entered. According to this theory, he must have jumped into another compartment lower down the train as the train was moving, and left it when the collision occurred, keeping his eye on me all the time, but not coming forward. He must even have walked after me down the line from Dover Priory to the pier.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, a shipwreck was a more serious affair than a railway accident. And if the ship were indeed doomed, it would puzzle even him to emerge with his life. He might seize me in the water, and from simple hate drag me to destruction,—yes, that was just what he would do,—but he would have a difficulty in saving himself. Such were my wild and fevered notions!</p>
<p class="calibre4">On the starboard bow I saw the dim bulk and the masthead lights of a steamer ap<a id="Page_184" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[184]"></a>proaching us. The other passengers had observed it, too, and there was a buzz of anticipation on the slanting deck. Only the inimical man opposite to me seemed to ignore the stir. He did not even turn round to look at the object which had aroused the general excitement. His eyes never left me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The vessel came nearer, till we could discern clearly the outline of her, and a black figure on her bridge. She was not more than a hundred yards away when the beat of her engines stopped. She hailed us. We waited for the answering call from our own captain, but there was no reply. Twice again she hailed us, and was answered only by silence.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Why don't our people reply?" an old lady asked, who came up to me at that moment, breathing heavily.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Because they are d—— d fools," I said roughly. She was a most respectable and prim old lady; yet I could not resist shocking her ears by an impropriety.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The other ship moved away into the night.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Was I in a dream? Was this a pantomime shipwreck? Then it occurred to me that the captain was so sure of being ultimately able to help himself that he preferred from motives <a id="Page_185" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[185]"></a>of economy to decline assistance which would involve a heavy salvage claim.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My self-possessed young man came along again in the course of his peregrinations, the girl whom he called Lottie still on his arm. He stopped for a chat.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Most curious thing!" he began.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What now?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Well, I found out about the collision."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"How did it occur?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"In this way. The captain was on duty on the bridge, with the steersman at the wheel. It was thickish weather then, much thicker than it is now—in fact, there'll soon be no breeze left, and look at the stars! Suddenly the lookout man shouted that there was a sail on the weather bow, and it must have been pretty close, too. The captain ordered the man at the wheel to put the boat to port—I don't know the exact phraseology of the thing—so that we could pass the other ship on our starboard side. Instead of doing that, the triple idiot shoved us to starboard as hard as he could, and before the captain could do anything, we were struck on the port paddle. The steersman had sent us right into the other ship. If he had wanted specially to land us <a id="Page_186" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[186]"></a>into a good smash-up, he could scarcely have done it better. A good thing we got caught on the paddle; otherwise we should have been cut clean in two. As it was, the other boat recoiled and fell away."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Was she damaged?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Probably not."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"How does the man at the wheel explain his action?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Well, that's the curious part. I was just coming to that. Naturally he's in a great state of terror just now, but he can just talk. He swears that when the captain gave his order a third person ran up the steps leading to the bridge, and so frightened him that he was sort of dazed, and did exactly the wrong thing."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"A queer tale!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I should think so. But he sticks to it. He even says that this highly mysterious third person made him do the wrong thing. But that's absolute tommy-rot."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"The man must be mad."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I should have said he had been drunk, but there doesn't seem to be any trace of that. Anyhow, he sees visions, and I maintain that the Chatham and Dover people oughtn't to <a id="Page_187" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[187]"></a>have their boats steered by men who see visions, eh?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I agree with you. I suppose we aren't now in any real danger?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I should hardly think so. We might have been. It was pure luck that we happened to get struck on the paddle-box, and also it was pure luck that the sea has gone down so rapidly. With a list like this, a really lively cross-sea would soon have settled us."</p>
<p class="calibre4">We were silent for a few moments. The girl looked idly round the ship, and her eyes encountered the figure of the mysterious man. She seemed to shiver.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Oh!" she exclaimed under her breath, "what a terrible face that man has!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Where?" said her friend.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Over there. And how is it he's wearing a silk hat—here?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">His glance followed hers, but my follower had turned abruptly round, and in a moment was moving quickly to the after-part of the ship. He passed behind the smoke-stack, and was lost to our view.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"The back of him looks pretty stiff," the young man said. "I wonder if he's the chap that alarmed the man at the wheel."</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_188" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[188]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">I laughed, and at the same time I accidentally dropped Rosa's jewel-case, which had never left my hand. I picked it up hurriedly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You seem attached to that case," the young man said, smiling. "If we had foundered, should you have let it go, or tried to swim ashore with it?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"The question is doubtful," I replied, returning his smile. In shipwrecks one soon becomes intimate with strangers.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"If I mistake not, it is a jewel-case."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It is a jewel-case."</p>
<p class="calibre4">He nodded with a moralizing air, as if reflecting upon the sordid love of property which will make a man carry a jewel-case about with him when the next moment he might find himself in the sea. At least, that was my interpretation of the nodding. Then the brother and sister—for such I afterwards discovered they were—left me to take care of my jewel-case alone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Why had I dropped the jewel-case? Was it because I was startled by the jocular remark which identified the mysterious man with the person who had disturbed the steersman? That remark was made in mere jest. Yet I could not help thinking that it contained the <a id="Page_189" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[189]"></a>truth. Nay, I knew that it was true; I knew by instinct. And being true, what facts were logically to be deduced from it? What aim had this mysterious man in compelling, by his strange influences, the innocent sailor to guide the ship towards destruction—the ship in which I happened to be a passenger?... And then there was the railway accident. The stoker had said that the engine-driver had been dazed—like the steersman. But no. There are avenues of conjecture from which the mind shrinks. I could not follow up that train of thought.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Happily, I did not see my enemy again—at least, during that journey. And my mind was diverted, for the dawn came—the beautiful September dawn. Never have I greeted the sun with deeper joy, and I fancy that my sentiments were shared by everyone on board the vessel. As the light spread over the leaden waters, and the coast of France was silhouetted against the sky, the passengers seemed to understand that danger was over, and that we had been through peril, and escaped. Some threw themselves upon their knees, and prayed with an ecstasy of thankfulness. Others re-commenced their hymning. Others laughed <a id="Page_190" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[190]"></a>rather hysterically, and began to talk at a prodigious rate. A few, like myself, stood silent and apparently unmoved.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then the engines began to beat. There was a frightful clatter of scrap-iron and wood in the port paddle-box, and they stopped immediately, whereupon we noticed that the list of the vessel was somewhat more marked than before. The remainder of the port paddle had, in fact, fallen away into the water. The hymn-singers ceased their melodies, absorbed in anticipating what would happen next. At last, after many orders and goings to and fro, the engines started again, this time, of course, the starboard paddle, deeply immersed, moved by itself. We progressed with infinite slowness, and in a most peculiar manner, but we did progress, and that was the main thing. The passengers cheered heartily.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We appeared to go in curves, but each curve brought us nearer to Calais. As we approached that haven of refuge, it seemed as if every steamer and smack of Calais was coming out to meet us. The steamers whistled, the owners of smacks bawled and shouted. They desired to assist; for were we not disabled, and would not the English railway com<a id="Page_191" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[191]"></a>pany pay well for help so gallantly rendered? Our captain, however, made no sign, and, like a wounded, sullen animal, from whom its companions timidly keep a respectful distance, we at length entered Calais harbor, and by dint of much seamanship and polyglottic swearing brought up safely at the quay.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then it was that one fully perceived, with a feeling of shame, how night had magnified the seriousness of the adventure; how it had been nothing, after all; how it would not fill more than half a column in the newspapers; how the officers of the ship must have despised the excited foolishness of passengers who would not listen to reasonable, commonplace explanations.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The boat was evacuated in the twinkling of an eye. I have never seen a Channel steamer so quickly empty itself. It was as though the people were stricken by a sudden impulse to dash away from the poor craft at any cost. At the Customs, amid all the turmoil and bustle, I saw neither my young friend and his sister, nor my enemy, who so far had clung to me on my journey.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I learned that a train would start in about a quarter of an hour. I had some coffee and <a id="Page_192" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[192]"></a>a roll at the buffet. While I was consuming that trifling refection the young man and his sister joined me. The girl was taciturn as before, but her brother talked cheerfully as he sipped chocolate; he told me that his name was Watts, and he introduced his sister. He had a pleasant but rather weak face, and as for his manner and bearing, I could not decide in my own mind whether he was a gentleman or a buyer from some London drapery warehouse on his way to the city of modes. He gave no information as to his profession or business, and as I had not even returned his confidence by revealing my name, this was not to be wondered at.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Are you going on to Paris?" he said presently.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes; and the sooner I get there the better I shall be pleased."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Exactly," he smiled. "I am going, too. I have crossed the Channel many times, but I have never before had such an experience as last night's."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then we began to compare notes of previous voyages, until a railway official entered the buffet with a raucous, "Voyageurs pour Paris, en voiture."</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_193" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[193]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">There was only one first-class carriage, and into this I immediately jumped, and secured a corner. Mr. Watts followed me, and took the other corner of the same seat. Miss Watts remained on the platform. It was a corridor carriage, and the corridor happened to be on the far side from the platform. Mr. Watts went out to explore the corridor. I arranged myself in my seat, placed the jewel-case by my side, and my mackintosh over my knees. Miss Watts stood idly in front of the carriage door, tapping the platform with her umbrella.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You do not accompany your brother, then?" I ventured.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"No. I'm staying in Calais, where I have an—an engagement." She smiled plaintively at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Mr. Watts came back into the compartment, and, standing on the step, said good-by to his sister, and embraced her. She kissed him affectionately. Then, having closed the carriage door, he stolidly resumed his seat, which was on the other side away from the door. We had the compartment to ourselves.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"A nice girl," I reflected.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The train whistled, and a porter ran along to put the catches on all the doors.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_194" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[194]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"Good-by; we're off," I said to Miss Watts.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Monsieur," she said, and her face seemed to flush in the cold morning light,—"monsieur." Was she, then, French, to address me like that?</p>
<p class="calibre4">She made a gesture as if she would say something to me of importance, and I put my head out of the window.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"May I ask you to keep an eye on my brother?" she whispered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"In what way?" I asked, somewhat astonished.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The train began to move, and she walked to keep level with me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Do not let him drink at any of the railway buffets on the journey; he will be met at the Gare du Nord. He is addicted—"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"But how can I stop him if he wants to—"</p>
<p class="calibre4">She had an appealing look, and she was running now to keep pace with the train.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Ah, do what you can, sir. I ask it as a favor. Pardon the request from a perfect stranger."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I nodded acquiescence, and, waving a farewell to the poor girl, sank back into my seat. "This is a nice commission!" I thought.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_195" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[195]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">Mr. Watts was no longer in his corner. Also my jewel-case was gone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"A deliberate plant!" I exclaimed; and I could not help admiring the cleverness with which it had been carried out.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I rushed into the corridor, and looked through every compartment; but Mr. Watts, whom I was to keep from drunkenness, had utterly departed. Then I made for the handle of the communication cord. It had been neatly cut off. The train was now travelling at a good speed, and the first stop would be Amiens. I was too ashamed of my simplicity to give the news of my loss to the other passengers in the carriage.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Very smart indeed!" I murmured, sitting down, and I smiled—for, after all, I could afford to smile.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00031" class="calibre3">A CHAT WITH ROSA</h3>
<p class="calibre4">"And when I sat down it was gone, and the precious Mr. Watts had also vanished."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Oh!" exclaimed Rosa. That was all she said. It is impossible to deny that she was startled, that she was aghast. I, however, maintained a splendid equanimity.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We were sitting in the salon of her flat at the Place de la Concorde end of the Rue de Rivoli. We had finished lunch, and she had offered me a cigarette. I had had a bath, and changed my attire, and eaten a meal cooked by a Frenchman, and I felt renewed. I had sunned myself in the society of Rosetta Rosa for an hour, and I felt soothed. I forgot all the discomforts and misgivings of the voyage. It was nothing to me, as I looked at this beautiful girl, that within the last twenty-four hours I had twice been in danger of losing my life. What to me was the mys<a id="Page_197" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[197]"></a>terious man with the haunting face of implacable hate? What to me were the words of the woman who had stopped me on the pier at Dover? Nothing! A thousand times less than nothing! I loved, and I was in the sympathetic presence of her whom I loved.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had waited till lunch was over to tell Rosa of the sad climax of my adventures.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes," I repeated, "I was never more completely done in my life. The woman conspirator took me in absolutely."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What did you do then?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Well, I wired to Calais immediately we got to Amiens, and told the police, and did all the things one usually does do when one has been robbed. Also, since arriving in Paris, I have been to the police here."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Do they hold out any hope of recovery?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I'm afraid they are not sanguine. You see, the pair had a good start, and I expect they belong to one of the leading gangs of jewel thieves in Europe. The entire business must have been carefully planned. Probably I was shadowed from the moment I left your bankers'."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It's unfortunate."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes, indeed. I felt sure that you would <a id="Page_198" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[198]"></a>attach some importance to the jewel-case. So I have instructed the police to do their utmost."</p>
<p class="calibre4">She seemed taken aback by the lightness of my tone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"My friend, those jewels were few, but they were valuable. They were worth—I don't know what they were worth. There was a necklace that must have cost fifteen thousand pounds."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes—the jewels."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Well! Is it not the jewels that are missing?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Dear lady," I said, "I aspire to be thought a man of the world—it is a failing of youth; but, then, I am young. As a man of the world, I cogitated a pretty good long time before I set out for Paris with your jewels."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You felt there was a danger of robbery?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Exactly."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"And you were not mistaken." There was irony in her voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"True! But let me proceed. A man of the world would see at once that a jewel-case was an object to attract the eyes of those who live by their wits."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I should imagine so."</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_199" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[199]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"Therefore, as a man of the world, I endeavored to devise a scheme of safeguarding my little cargo."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"And you—"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I devised one."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What was it?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I took all the jewels out of the case, and put them into my various pockets; and I carried the case to divert attention from those pockets."</p>
<p class="calibre4">She looked at me, her face at first all perplexity; gradually the light broke upon her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Simple, wasn't it?" I murmured.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Then the jewels are not stolen?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Certainly not. The jewels are in my pockets. If you recollect, I said it was the jewel-case that was stolen."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I began to smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Mr. Foster," she said, smiling too, "I am extremely angry."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Forgive the joke," I entreated. "Perhaps it is a bad one—but I hope not a very bad one, because very bad jokes are inexcusable. And here are your jewels."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I put on the expression of a peccant but hopeful schoolboy, as I emptied one pocket after another of the scintillating treasures. <a id="Page_200" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[200]"></a>The jewels lay, a gorgeous heap, on her lap. The necklace which she had particularly mentioned was of pearls. There were also rubies and emeralds, upon which she seemed to set special store, and a brooch in the form of a butterfly, which she said was made expressly for her by Lalique. But not a diamond in the collection! It appeared that she regarded diamonds as some men regard champagne—as a commodity not appealing to the very finest taste.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I didn't think you were so mischievous," she laughed, frowning.</p>
<p class="calibre4">To transfer the jewels to her possession I had drawn my chair up to hers, and we were close together, face to face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Ah!" I replied, content, unimaginably happy. "You don't know me yet. I'm a terrible fellow."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Think of my state of mind during the last fifteen minutes."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes, but think of the joy which you now experience. It is I who have given you that joy—the joy of losing and gaining all that in a quarter of an hour."</p>
<p class="calibre4">She picked up the necklace, and as she gazed at the stones her glance had a rapt <a id="Page_201" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[201]"></a>expression, as though she were gazing through their depths into the past.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Mr. Foster," she said at length, without ceasing to look at the pearls, "I cannot tell you how glad I am that you are in Paris. Shall you stay till I have appeared at the Opéra Comique?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I was hoping to, and if you say you would like me to—"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Ah!" she exclaimed, "I do." And she looked up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her lovely eyes had a suspicion of moisture. The blood rushed through my head, and I could feel its turbulent throb-throb across the temples and at my heart.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was in heaven, and residence in heaven makes one bold.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You really would like me to stay?" I almost whispered, in a tone that was equivalent to a declaration.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her eyes met mine in silence for a few instants, and then she said, with a touch of melancholy:</p>
<p class="calibre4">"In all my life I've only had two friends—I mean since my mother's death; and you are the third."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Is that all?"</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_202" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[202]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"You don't know what a life like mine is," she went on, with feeling. "I'm only a prima donna, you know. People think that because I can make as much money in three hours as a milliner's girl can make in three years, and because I'm always in the midst of luxuries, and because I have whims and caprices, and because my face has certain curves in it, and because men get jealous with each other about kissing my hand, that therefore I've got all I want."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Certain curves!" I burst out. "Why, you're the most beautiful creature I ever saw!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"There!" she cried. "That's just how they all talk. I do hate it."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Do you?" I said. "Then I'll never call you beautiful again. But I should have thought you were fairly happy."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I'm happy when I'm singing well," she answered—"only then. I like singing. I like to see an audience moved. I must sing. Singing is my life. But do you know what that means? That means that I belong to the public, and so I can't hide myself. That means that I am always—always—surrounded by 'admirers.'"</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_203" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[203]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"Well?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Well, I don't like them. I don't like any of them. And I don't like them in the mass. Why can't I just sing, and then belong simply to myself? They are for ever there, my 'admirers.' Men of wealth, men of talent, men of adventure, men of wits—all devoted, all respectful, all ready to marry me. Some honorable, according to the accepted standard, others probably dishonorable. And there is not one but whose real desire is to own me. I know them. Love! In my world, peculiar in that world in which I live, there is no such thing as love—only a showy imitation. Yes, they think they love me. 'When we are married you will not sing any more; you will be mine then,' says one. That is what he imagines is love. And others would have me for the gold-mine that is in my throat. I can read their greed in their faces."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her candid bitterness surprised as much as it charmed me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Aren't you a little hard on them?" I ventured.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Now, am I?" she retorted. "Don't be a hypocrite. Am I?"</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_204" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[204]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">I said nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You know perfectly well I'm not," she answered for me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"But I admire you," I said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You're different," she replied. "You don't belong to my world. That's what pleases me in you. You haven't got that silly air of always being ready to lay down your life for me. You didn't come in this morning with a bunch of expensive orchids, and beg that I should deign to accept them." She pointed to various bouquets in the room. "You just came in and shook hands, and asked me how I was."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I never thought of bringing any flowers," I said awkwardly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Just so. That's the point. That's what I like. If there is one thing that I can't tolerate, and that I have to tolerate, it's 'attentions,' especially from people who copy their deportment from Russian Archdukes."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"There are Archdukes?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Why! the air is thick with them. Why do men think that a woman is flattered by their ridiculous 'attentions?' If they knew how sometimes I can scarcely keep from laughing! There are moments when I would <a id="Page_205" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[205]"></a>give anything to be back again in the days when I knew no one more distinguished than a concierge. There was more sincerity at my disposal then."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"But surely all distinguished people are not insincere?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"They are insincere to opera singers who happen to be young, beautiful, and rich, which is my sad case. The ways of the people who flutter round a theatre are not my ways. I was brought up simply, as you were in your Devonshire home. I hate to spend my life as if it was one long diplomatic reception. Ugh!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">She clenched her hands, and one of the threads of the necklace gave way, and the pearls scattered themselves over her lap.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"There! That necklace was given to me by one of my friends!" She paused.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes?" I said tentatively.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"He is dead now. You have heard—everyone knows—that I was once engaged to Lord Clarenceux. He was a friend. He loved me—he died—my friends have a habit of dying. Alresca died."</p>
<p class="calibre4">The conversation halted. I wondered whether I might speak of Lord Clarenceux, <a id="Page_206" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[206]"></a>or whether to do so would be an indiscretion. She began to collect the pearls.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes," she repeated softly, "he was a friend."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I drew a strange satisfaction from the fact that, though she had said frankly that he loved her, she had not even hinted that she loved him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Lord Clarenceux must have been a great man," I said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"That is exactly what he was," she answered with a vague enthusiasm. "And a great nobleman too! So different from the others. I wish I could describe him to you, but I cannot. He was immensely rich—he looked on me as a pauper. He had the finest houses, the finest judgment in the world. When he wanted anything he got it, no matter what the cost. All dealers knew that, and any one who had 'the best' to sell knew that in Lord Clarenceux he would find a purchaser. He carried things with a high hand. I never knew another man so determined, or one who could be more stern or more exquisitely kind. He knew every sort of society, and yet he had never married. He fell in love with me, and offered me his hand. I <a id="Page_207" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[207]"></a>declined—I was afraid of him. He said he would shoot himself. And he would have done it; so I accepted. I should have ended by loving him. For he wished me to love him, and he always had his way. He was a man, and he held the same view of my world that I myself hold. Mr. Foster, you must think I'm in a very chattering mood."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I protested with a gesture.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Lord Clarenceux died. And I am alone. I was terribly lonely after his death. I missed his jealousy."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"He was jealous?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"He was the most jealous man, I think, who ever lived. His jealousy escorted me everywhere like a guard of soldiers. Yet I liked him even for that. He was genuine; so sincere, so masterful with it. In all matters his methods were drastic. If he had been alive I should not be tormented by the absurd fears which I now allow to get the better of me."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Fears! About what?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"To be frank, about my debut at the Opéra Comique. I can imagine," she smiled, "how he would have dealt with that situation."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You are afraid of something?"</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_208" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[208]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I don't know. I merely fear.... There is Carlotta Deschamps."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Miss Rosa, a few minutes ago you called me your friend." My voice was emotional; I felt it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I did, because you are. I have no claim on you, but you have been very good to me."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You have the best claim on me. Will you rely on me?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">We looked at each other.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I will," she said. I stood before her, and she took my hand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You say you fear. I hope your fears are groundless—candidly, I can't see how they can be otherwise. But suppose anything should happen. Well, I shall be at your service."</p>
<p class="calibre4">At that moment some one knocked and entered. It was Yvette. She avoided my glance.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Madame will take her egg-and-milk before going to rehearsal?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes, Yvette. Bring it to me here, please."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You have a rehearsal to-day?" I asked. "I hope I'm not detaining you."</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_209" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[209]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"Not at all. The call is for three o'clock. This is the second one, and they fixed the hour to suit me. It is really my first rehearsal, because at the previous one I was too hoarse to sing a note."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I rose to go.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Wouldn't you like to come with me to the theatre?" she said with an adorable accent of invitation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My good fortune staggered me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After she had taken her egg-and-milk we set out.</p>
<hr class="c"/>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_210" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[210]"></a></p>
<div class="calibre5"></div><div class="calibre5"></div><h2 id="pgepubid00032" class="calibre6"><a id="CHAPTER_XII" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1 calibre12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3 id="pgepubid00033" class="calibre3">EGG-AND-MILK</h3>
<p class="calibre4">I was intensely conscious of her beauty as I sat by her side in the swiftly rolling victoria. And I was conscious of other qualities in her too—of her homeliness, her good-fellowship, her trustfulness. The fact that she was one of the most famous personalities in Europe did not, after our talk, in the least disturb my pleasing dreams of a possible future. It was, nevertheless, specially forced upon me, for as we drove along the Rue de Rivoli, past the interminable façades of the Louvre, and the big shops, and so into the meaner quarter of the markets—the Opéra Comique was then situated in its temporary home in the Place du Châtelet—numberless wayfarers showed by their demeanor of curiosity that Rosetta Rosa was known to them. They were much more polite than English people would have been, but they did not hide their interest in us.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_211" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[211]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">The jewels had been locked away in a safe, except one gorgeous emerald brooch which she was wearing at her neck.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It appears," I said, "that in Paris one must not even attend rehearsals without jewels."</p>
<p class="calibre4">She laughed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You think I have a passion for jewels, and you despise me for it."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"By no means. Nobody has a better right to wear precious stones than yourself."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Can you guess why I wear them?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Not because they make you look prettier, for that's impossible."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Will you please remember that I like you because you are not in the habit of making speeches."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I beg pardon. I won't offend again. Well, then, I will confess that I don't know why you wear jewels. There must be a Puritan strain in my character, for I cannot enter into the desire for jewels. I say this merely because you have practically invited me to be brutal."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Now that I recall that conversation I realize how gentle she was towards my crude and <a id="Page_212" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[212]"></a>callous notions concerning personal adornment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yet you went to England in order to fetch my jewels."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"No, I went to England in order to be of use to a lady. But tell me—why do you wear jewels off the stage?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Simply because, having them, I have a sort of feeling that they ought to be used. It seems a waste to keep them hidden in a strong box, and I never could tolerate waste. Really, I scarcely care more for jewels, as jewels, than you do yourself."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Still, for a person who doesn't care for them, you seem to have a fair quantity of them."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Ah! But many were given to me—and the rest I bought when I was young, or soon afterwards. Besides, they are part of my stock in trade."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"When you were young!" I repeated, smiling. "How long is that since?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Ages."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I coughed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It is seven years since I was young," she said, "and I was sixteen at the time."</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_213" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[213]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"You are positively venerable, then; and since you are, I must be too."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I am much older than you are," she said; "not in years, but in life. You don't feel old."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"And do you?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Frightfully."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What brings it on?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Oh! Experience—and other things. It is the soul which grows old."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"But you have been happy?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Never—never in my life, except when I was singing, have I been happy. Have you been happy?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes," I said, "once or twice."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"When you were a boy?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"No, since I have become a man. Just—just recently."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"People fancy they are happy," she murmured.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Isn't that the same thing as being happy?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Perhaps." Then suddenly changing the subject: "You haven't told me about your journey. Just a bare statement that there was a delay on the railway and another delay on the steamer. Don't you think you ought to fill in the details?"</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_214" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[214]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">So I filled them in; but I said nothing about my mysterious enemy who had accompanied me, and who after strangely disappearing and reappearing had disappeared again; nor about the woman whom I had met on the Admiralty Pier. I wondered when he might reappear once more. There was no proper reason why I should not have told Rosa about these persons, but some instinctive feeling, some timidity of spirit, prevented me from doing so.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"How thrilling! Were you frightened on the steamer?" she asked.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes," I admitted frankly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You may not think it," she said, "but I should not have been frightened. I have never been frightened at Death."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"But have you ever been near him?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Who knows?" she answered thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We were at the stage-door of the theatre. The olive-liveried footman dismounted, and gravely opened the door of the carriage. I got out, and gave my hand to Rosa, and we entered the theatre.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In an instant she had become the prima donna. The curious little officials of the <a id="Page_215" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[215]"></a>theatre bowed before her, and with prodigious smiles waved us forward to the stage. The stage-manager, a small, fat man with white hair, was drilling the chorus. As soon as he caught sight of us he dismissed the short-skirted girls and the fatigued-looking men, and skipped towards us. The orchestra suddenly ceased. Everyone was quiet. The star had come.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Good day, mademoiselle. You are here to the moment."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rosa and the régisseur talked rapidly together, and presently the conductor of the orchestra stepped from his raised chair on to the stage, and with a stately inclination to Rosa joined in the conversation. As for me, I looked about, and was stared at. So far as I could see there was not much difference between an English stage and a French stage, viewed at close quarters, except that the French variety possesses perhaps more officials and a more bureaucratic air. I gazed into the cold, gloomy auditorium, so bare of decoration, and decided that in England such an auditorium would not be tolerated.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After much further chatter the conductor bowed again, and returned to his seat. Rosa <a id="Page_216" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[216]"></a>beckoned to me, and I was introduced to the stage-manager.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Allow me to present to you Mr. Foster, one of my friends."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rosa coughed, and I noticed that her voice was slightly hoarse.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You have taken cold during the drive," I said, pouring into the sea of French a little stream of English.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Oh, no. It is nothing; it will pass off in a minute."</p>
<p class="calibre4">The stage-manager escorted me to a chair near a grand piano which stood in the wings. Then some male artists, evidently people of importance, appeared out of the darkness at the back of the stage. Rosa took off her hat and gloves, and placed them on the grand piano. I observed that she was flushed, and I put it down to the natural excitement of the artist about to begin work. The orchestra sounded resonantly in the empty theatre, and, under the yellow glare of unshaded electricity, the rehearsal of "Carmen" began at the point where Carmen makes her first entry.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As Rosa came to the centre of the stage from the wings she staggered. One would have thought she was drunk. At her cue, <a id="Page_217" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[217]"></a>instead of commencing to sing, she threw up her hands, and with an appealing glance at me sank down to the floor. I rushed to her, and immediately the entire personnel of the theatre was in a state of the liveliest excitement. I thought of a similar scene in London not many months before. But the poor girl was perfectly conscious, and even self-possessed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Water!" she murmured. "I shall die of thirst if you don't give me some water to drink at once."</p>
<p class="calibre4">There appeared to be no water within the theatre, but at last some one appeared with a carafe and glass. She drank two glassfuls, and then dropped the glass, which broke on the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I am not well," she said; "I feel so hot, and there is that hoarseness in my throat. Mr. Foster, you must take me home. The rehearsal will have to be postponed again; I am sorry. It's very queer."</p>
<p class="calibre4">She stood up with my assistance, looking wildly about her, but appealing to no one but myself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It is queer," I said, supporting her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Mademoiselle was ill in the same way last <a id="Page_218" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[218]"></a>time," several sympathetic voices cried out, and some of the women caressed her gently.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Let me get home," she said, half-shouting, and she clung to me. "My hat—my gloves—quick!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes, yes," I said; "I will get a fiacre."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Why not my victoria?" she questioned imperiously.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Because you must go in a closed carriage," I said firmly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Mademoiselle will accept my brougham?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">A tall dark man had come forward. He was the Escamillo. She thanked him with a look. Some woman threw a cloak over Rosa's shoulders, and, the baritone on one side of her and myself on the other, we left the theatre. It seemed scarcely a moment since she had entered it confident and proud.</p>
<p class="calibre4">During the drive back to her flat I did not speak, but I examined her narrowly. Her skin was dry and burning, and on her forehead there was a slight rash. Her lips were dry, and she continually made the motion of swallowing. Her eyes sparkled, and they seemed to stand out from her head. Also she still bitterly complained of thirst. She wanted, indeed, to stop the carriage and have <a id="Page_219" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[219]"></a>something to drink at the Café de l'Univers, but I absolutely declined to permit such a proceeding, and in a few minutes we were at her flat. The attack was passing away. She mounted the stairs without much difficulty.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You must go to bed," I said. We were in the salon. "In a few hours you will be better."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I will ring for Yvette."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"No," I said, "you will not ring for Yvette. I want Yvette myself. Have you no other servant who can assist you?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes. But why not Yvette?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You can question me to-morrow. Please obey me now. I am your doctor. I will ring the bell. Yvette will come, and you will at once go out of the room, find another servant, and retire to bed. You can do that? You are not faint?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"No, I can do it; but it is very queer."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I rang the bell.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You have said that before, and I say, 'It is queer; queerer than you imagine.' One thing I must ask you before you go. When you had the attack in the theatre did you see things double?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes," she answered. "But how did you <a id="Page_220" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[220]"></a>know? I felt as though I was intoxicated; but I had taken nothing whatever."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Excuse me, you had taken egg-and-milk. Here is the glass out of which you drank it." I picked up the glass, which had been left on the table, and which still contained about a spoonful of egg-and-milk.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yvette entered in response to my summons.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Mademoiselle has returned soon," the girl began lightly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes."</p>
<p class="calibre4">The two women looked at each other. I hastened to the door, and held it open for Rosa to pass out. She did so. I closed the door, and put my back against it. The glass I still held in my hand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Now, Yvette, I want to ask you a few questions."</p>
<p class="calibre4">She stood before me, pretty even in her plain black frock and black apron, and folded her hands. Her face showed no emotion whatever.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes, monsieur, but mademoiselle will need me."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Mademoiselle will not need you. She will never need you again."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Monsieur says?"</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_221" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[221]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"You see this glass. What did you put in it?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"The cook put egg-and-milk into it."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I ask what you put in it?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I, monsieur? Nothing."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You are lying, my girl. Your mistress has been poisoned."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I swear—"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I should advise you not to swear. You have twice attempted to poison your mistress. Why did you do it?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"But this is absurd."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Does your mistress use eyedrops when she sings at the Opéra?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Eyedrops?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You know what I mean. A lotion which you drop into the eye in order to dilate the pupil."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"My mistress never uses eyedrops."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Does Madame Carlotta Deschamps use eyedrops?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a courageous move on my part, but it had its effect. She was startled.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I—I don't know, monsieur."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I ask because eyedrops contain atropine, and mademoiselle is suffering from a slight, a very slight, attack of atropine poisoning. <a id="Page_222" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[222]"></a>The dose must have been very nicely gauged; it was just enough to produce a temporary hoarseness and discomfort. I needn't tell such a clever girl as you that atropine acts first on the throat. It has clearly been some one's intention to prevent mademoiselle from singing at rehearsals, and from appearing in Paris in 'Carmen.'"</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yvette drew herself up, her nostrils quivering. She had turned decidedly pale.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Monsieur insults me by his suspicions. I must go."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You won't go just immediately. I may tell you further that I have analyzed the contents of this glass, and have found traces of atropine."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had done no such thing, but that was a detail.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Also, I have sent for the police."</p>
<p class="calibre4">This, too, was an imaginative statement.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yvette approached me suddenly, and flung her arms round my neck. I had just time to put the glass on the seat of a chair and seize her hands.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"No," I said, "you will neither spill that glass nor break it."</p>
<p class="calibre4">She dropped at my feet weeping.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_223" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[223]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"Have pity on me, monsieur!" She looked up at me through her tears, and the pose was distinctly effective. "It was Madame Deschamps who asked me to do it. I used to be with her before I came to mademoiselle. She gave me the bottle, but I didn't know it was poison—I swear I didn't!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What did you take it to be, then? Jam? Two grains of atropine will cause death."</p>
<p class="calibre4">For answer she clung to my knees. I released myself, and moved away a few steps. She jumped up, and made a dash for the door, but I happened to have locked it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Where is Madame Deschamps?" I asked.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"She returns to Paris to-morrow. Monsieur will let me go. I was only a tool."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I will consider that matter, Yvette," I said. "In my opinion you are a thoroughly wicked girl, and I wouldn't trust you any further than I could see you. For the present, you will have an opportunity to meditate over your misdoings." I left the room, and locked the door on the outside.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Impossible to disguise the fact that I was enormously pleased with myself—with my sharpness, my smartness, my penetration, my success.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00035" class="calibre3">THE PORTRAIT</h3>
<p class="calibre4">For the next hour or two I wandered about Rosa's flat like an irresolute and bewildered spirit. I wished to act, yet without Rosa I scarcely liked to do so. That some sort of a plot existed—whether serious or trivial was no matter—there could be little doubt, and there could be little doubt also that Carlotta Deschamps was at the root of it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Several half-formed schemes flitted through my head, but none of them seemed to be sufficiently clever. I had the idea of going to see Carlotta Deschamps in order to warn her. Then I thought the warning might perhaps be sent through her sister Marie, who was doubtless in Paris, and who would probably be able to control Carlotta. I had not got Carlotta's address, but I might get it by going to the Casino de Paris, and asking Marie for it. Perhaps Marie, suspicious, might refuse <a id="Page_225" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[225]"></a>the address. Had she not said that she and Carlotta were as thick as thieves? Moreover, assuming that I could see Carlotta, what should I say to her? How should I begin? Then it occurred to me that the shortest way with such an affair was to go directly to the police, as I had already threatened Yvette; but the appearance of the police would mean publicity, scandal, and other things unpleasant for Rosa. So it fell out that I maintained a discreet inactivity.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Towards nightfall I went into the street to breathe the fresh air. A man was patrolling the pavement in a somewhat peculiar manner. I returned indoors, and after half an hour reconnoitred once more. The man was on the opposite side of the road, with his eyes on the windows of the salon. When he caught sight of me he walked slowly away. He might have been signalling to Yvette, who was still under lock and key, but this possibility did not disturb me, as escape was out of the question for her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I went back to the flat, and a servant met me in the hall with a message that mademoiselle was now quite recovered, and would like to see me in her boudoir. I hurried to her. <a id="Page_226" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[226]"></a>A fire was burning on the hearth, and before this were two lounge chairs. Rosa occupied one, and she motioned me to the other. Attired in a peignoir of pure white, and still a little languorous after the attack, she looked the enchanting perfection of beauty and grace. But in her eyes, which were unduly bright, there shone an apprehension, the expectancy of the unknown.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I am better," she said, with a faint smile. "Feel my pulse."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I held her wrist and took out my watch, but I forgot to count, and I forgot to note the seconds. I was gazing at her. It seemed absurd to contemplate the possibility of ever being able to call her my own.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Am I not better?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes, yes," I said; "the pulse is—the pulse is—you are much better."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then I pushed my chair a little further from the fire, and recollected that there were several things to be said and done.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I expected the attack would pass very quickly," I said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Then you know what I have been suffering from," she said, turning her chair rapidly half-round towards me.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_227" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[227]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"I do," I answered, with emphasis.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was silent.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Well," she said, "tell me what it is." She laughed, but her voice was low and anxious.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I am just wondering whether I shall tell you."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Stuff!" she exclaimed proudly. "Am I a child?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You are a woman, and should be shielded from the sharp edges of life."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Ah!" she murmured "Not all men have thought so. And I wish you wouldn't talk like that."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Nevertheless, I think like that," I said. "And I'm really anxious to save you from unnecessary annoyance."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Then I insist that you shall tell me," she replied inconsequently. "I will not have you adopt that attitude towards me. Do you understand? I won't have it! I'm not a Dresden shepherdess, and I won't be treated like one—at any rate, by you. So there!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was in the seventh heaven of felicity.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"If you will have it, you have been poisoned."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I told her of my suspicions, and how they <a id="Page_228" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[228]"></a>had been confirmed by Yvette's avowal. She shivered, and then stood up and came towards me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Do you mean to say that Carlotta Deschamps and my own maid have conspired together to poison me simply because I am going to sing in a certain piece at a certain theatre? It's impossible!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"But it is true. Deschamps may not have wished to kill you; she merely wanted to prevent you from singing, but she ran a serious risk of murder, and she must have known it."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rosa began to sob, and I led her back to her chair.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I ought not to have told you to-night," I said. "But we should communicate with the police, and I wanted your authority before doing so."</p>
<p class="calibre4">She dried her eyes, but her frame still shook.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I will sing 'Carmen,'" she said passionately.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Of course you will. We must get these two arrested, and you shall have proper protection."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Police? No! We will have no police."</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_229" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[229]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"You object to the scandal? I had thought of that."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It is not that I object to the scandal. I despise Deschamps and Yvette too much to take the slightest notice of either of them. I could not have believed that women would so treat another woman." She hid her face in her hands.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"But is it not your duty—" I began.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Mr. Foster, please, please don't argue. I am incapable of prosecuting these creatures. You say Yvette is locked up in the salon. Go to her, and tell her to depart. Tell her that I shall do nothing, that I do not hate her, that I bear her no ill-will, that I simply ignore her. And let her carry the same message to Carlotta Deschamps."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Suppose there should be a further plot?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"There can't be. Knowing that this one is discovered, they will never dare.... And even if they tried again in some other way, I would sooner walk in danger all my life than acknowledge the existence of such creatures. Will you go at once?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"As you wish;" and I went out.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Mr. Foster."</p>
<p class="calibre4">She called me back. Taking my hand with <a id="Page_230" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[230]"></a>a gesture half-caressing, she raised her face to mine. Our eyes met, and in hers was a gentle, trustful appeal, a pathetic and entrancing wistfulness, which sent a sudden thrill through me. Her clasp of my fingers tightened ever so little.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I haven't thanked you in words," she said, "for all you have done for me, and are doing. But you know I'm grateful, don't you?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">I could feel the tears coming into my eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It is nothing, absolutely nothing," I muttered, and hurried from the room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At first, in the salon, I could not see Yvette, though the electric light had been turned on, no doubt by herself. Then there was a movement of one of the window-curtains, and she appeared from behind it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Oh, it is you," she said calmly, with a cold smile. She had completely recovered her self-possession, so much was evident; and apparently she was determined to play the game to the end, accepting defeat with an air of ironical and gay indifference. Yvette was by no means an ordinary woman. Her face was at once sinister and attractive, with lines of strength about it; she moved with a certain distinction; she had brains and various abil<a id="Page_231" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[231]"></a>ities; and I imagined her to have been capable of some large action, a first-class sin or a really dramatic self-sacrifice—she would have been ready for either. But of her origin I am to this day as ignorant as of her ultimate fate.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A current of air told me that a window was open.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I noticed a suspicious-looking man outside just now," I said. "Is he one of your confederates? Have you been communicating with him?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">She sat down in an armchair, leaned backwards, and began to hum an air—la, la, la.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Answer me. Come!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"And if I decline?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You will do well to behave yourself," I said; and, going to the window, I closed it, and slipped the catch.</p>
