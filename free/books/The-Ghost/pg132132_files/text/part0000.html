<h3 id="pgepubid00011" class="calibre3">MY SPLENDID COUSIN</h3>
<p class="calibre4">I am eight years older now. It had never occurred to me that I am advancing in life and experience until, in setting myself to recall the various details of the affair, I suddenly remembered my timid confusion before the haughty mien of the clerk at Keith Prowse's.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had asked him:</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Have you any amphitheatre seats for the Opera to-night?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">He did not reply. He merely put his lips together and waved his hand slowly from side to side.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Not perceiving, in my simplicity, that he was thus expressing a sublime pity for the ignorance which my demand implied, I innocently proceeded:</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Nor balcony?"</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_2" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[2]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">This time he condescended to speak.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Noth—ing, sir."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then I understood that what he meant was: "Poor fool! why don't you ask for the moon?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">I blushed. Yes, I blushed before the clerk at Keith Prowse's, and turned to leave the shop. I suppose he thought that as a Christian it was his duty to enlighten my pitiable darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It's the first Rosa night to-night," he said with august affability. "I had a couple of stalls this morning, but I've just sold them over the telephone for six pound ten."</p>
<p class="calibre4">He smiled. His smile crushed me. I know better now. I know that clerks in box-offices, with their correct neckties and their air of continually doing wonders over the telephone, are not, after all, the grand masters of the operatic world. I know that that manner of theirs is merely a part of their attire, like their cravats; that they are not really responsible for the popularity of great sopranos; and that they probably go home at nights to Fulham by the white omnibus, or to Hammersmith by the red one—and not in broughams.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I see," I observed, carrying my crushed remains out into the street. Impossible to <a id="Page_3" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[3]"></a>conceal the fact that I had recently arrived from Edinburgh as raw as a ploughboy!</p>
<p class="calibre4">If you had seen me standing irresolute on the pavement, tapping my stick of Irish bog-oak idly against the curbstone, you would have seen a slim youth, rather nattily dressed (I think), with a shadow of brown on his upper lip, and a curl escaping from under his hat, and the hat just a little towards the back of his head, and a pretty good chin, and the pride of life in his ingenuous eye. Quite unaware that he was immature! Quite unaware that the supple curves of his limbs had an almost feminine grace that made older fellows feel paternal! Quite unaware that he had everything to learn, and that all his troubles lay before him! Actually fancying himself a man because he had just taken his medical degree....</p>
<p class="calibre4">The June sun shone gently radiant in a blue sky, and above the roofs milky-bosomed clouds were floating in a light wind. The town was bright, fresh, alert, as London can be during the season, and the joyousness of the busy streets echoed the joyousness of my heart (for I had already, with the elasticity of my years, recovered from the reverse inflicted on me by Keith Prowse's clerk). On the opposite side <a id="Page_4" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[4]"></a>of the street were the rich premises of a well-known theatrical club, whose weekly entertainments had recently acquired fame. I was, I recollect, proud of knowing the identity of the building—it was one of the few things I did know in London—and I was observing with interest the wondrous livery of the two menials motionless behind the glass of its portals, when a tandem equipage drew up in front of the pile, and the menials darted out, in their white gloves, to prove that they were alive and to justify their existence.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was an amazingly complete turnout, and it well deserved all the attention it attracted, which was considerable. The horses were capricious, highly polished grays, perhaps a trifle undersized, but with such an action as is not to be bought for less than twenty-five guineas a hoof; the harness was silver-mounted; the dog-cart itself a creation of beauty and nice poise; the groom a pink and priceless perfection. But the crown and summit of the work was the driver—a youngish gentleman who, from the gloss of his peculiarly shaped collar to the buttons of his diminutive boots, exuded an atmosphere of expense. His gloves, his scarf-pin, his watch-chain, his mustache, his <a id="Page_5" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[5]"></a>eye-glass, the crease in his nether garments, the cut of his coat-tails, the curves of his hat—all uttered with one accord the final word of fashion, left nothing else to be said. The correctness of Keith Prowse's clerk was as naught to his correctness. He looked as if he had emerged immaculate from the outfitter's boudoir, an achievement the pride of Bond Street.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As this marvellous creature stood up and prepared to alight from the vehicle, he chanced to turn his eye-glass in my direction. He scanned me carelessly, glanced away, and scanned me again with a less detached stare. And I, on my part, felt the awakening of a memory.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"That's my cousin Sullivan," I said to myself. "I wonder if he wants to be friends."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Our eyes coquetted. I put one foot into the roadway, withdrew it, restored it to the roadway, and then crossed the street.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was indeed the celebrated Sullivan Smith, composer of those so successful musical comedies, "The Japanese Cat," "The Arabian Girl," and "My Queen." And he condescended to recognize me! His gestures indicated, in fact, a warm desire to be cousinly. I reached him. The moment was historic. While the <a id="Page_6" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[6]"></a>groom held the wheeler's head, and the twin menials assisted with dignified inactivity, we shook hands.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"How long is it?" he said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Fifteen years—about," I answered, feeling deliciously old.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Remember I punched your head?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Rather!" (Somehow I was proud that he had punched my head.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">"No credit to me," he added magnanimously, "seeing I was years older than you and a foot or so taller. By the way, Carl, how old did you say you were?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">He regarded me as a sixth-form boy might regard a fourth-form boy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I didn't say I was any age," I replied. "But I'm twenty-three."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Well, then, you're quite old enough to have a drink. Come into the club and partake of a gin-and-angostura, old man. I'll clear all this away."</p>
<p class="calibre4">He pointed to the equipage, the horses, and the groom, and with an apparently magic word whispered into the groom's ear he did in fact clear them away. They rattled and jingled off in the direction of Leicester Square, while <a id="Page_7" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[7]"></a>Sullivan muttered observations on the groom's driving.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Don't imagine I make a practice of tooling tandems down to my club," said Sullivan. "I don't. I brought the thing along to-day because I've sold it complete to Lottie Cass. You know her, of course?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I don't."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Well, anyhow," he went on after this check, "I've sold her the entire bag of tricks. What do you think I'm going to buy?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"A motor-car, old man!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">In those days the person who bought a motor-car was deemed a fearless adventurer of romantic tendencies. And Sullivan so deemed himself. The very word "motor-car" then had a strange and thrilling romantic sound with it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"The deuce you are!" I exclaimed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I am," said he, happy in having impressed me. He took my arm as though we had been intimate for a thousand years, and led me fearlessly past the swelling menials within the gate to the club smoking-room, and put me into a grandfather's chair of pale heliotrope plush in front of an onyx table, and put himself into <a id="Page_8" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[8]"></a>another grandfather's chair of heliotrope plush. And in the cushioned quietude of the smoking-room, where light-shod acolytes served gin-and-angostura as if serving gin-and-angostura had been a religious rite, Sullivan went through an extraordinary process of unchaining himself. His form seemed to be crossed and re-crossed with chains—gold chains. At the end of one gold chain was a gold cigarette-case, from which he produced gold-tipped cigarettes. At the end of another was a gold matchbox. At the end of another, which he may or may not have drawn out by mistake, were all sorts of things—knives, keys, mirrors, and pencils. A singular ceremony! But I was now in the world of gold.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And then smoke ascended from the gold-tipped cigarettes as incense from censers, and Sullivan lifted his tinted glass of gin-and-angostura, and I, perceiving that such actions were expected of one in a theatrical club, responsively lifted mine, and the glasses collided, and Sullivan said:</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Here's to the end of the great family quarrel."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I'm with you," said I.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And we sipped.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_9" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[9]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">My father had quarrelled with his mother in an epoch when even musical comedies were unknown, and the quarrel had spread, as family quarrels do, like a fire or the measles. The punching of my head by Sullivan in the extinct past had been one of its earliest consequences.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"May the earth lie lightly on them!" said Sullivan.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He was referring to the originators of the altercation. The tone in which he uttered this wish pleased me—it was so gentle. It hinted that there was more in Sullivan than met the eye, though a great deal met the eye. I liked him. He awed me, and he also seemed to me somewhat ridiculous in his excessive pomp. But I liked him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The next instant we were talking about Sullivan Smith. How he contrived to switch the conversation suddenly into that channel I cannot imagine. Some people have a gift of conjuring with conversations. They are almost always frankly and openly interested in themselves, as Sullivan was interested in himself. You may seek to foil them; you may even violently wrench the conversation into other directions. But every effort will be useless. They will beat you. You had much better lean <a id="Page_10" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[10]"></a>back in your chair and enjoy their legerdemain.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In about two minutes Sullivan was in the very midst of his career.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I never went in for high art, you know. All rot! I found I could write melodies that people liked and remembered." (He was so used to reading interviews with himself in popular weeklies that he had caught the formalistic phraseology, and he was ready apparently to mistake even his cousin for an interviewer. But I liked him.) "And I could get rather classy effects out of an orchestra. And so I kept on. I didn't try to be Wagner. I just stuck to Sullivan Smith. And, my boy, let me tell you it's only five years since 'The Japanese Cat' was produced, and I'm only twenty-seven, my boy! And now, who is there that doesn't know me?" He put his elbows on the onyx. "Privately, between cousins, you know, I made seven thousand quid last year, and spent half that. I live on half my income; always have done; always shall. Good principle! I'm a man of business, I am, Carl Foster. Give the public what they want, and save half your income—that's the ticket. Look at me. I've got to act the duke; it pays, <a id="Page_11" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[11]"></a>so I do it. I am a duke. I get twopence apiece royalty on my photographs. That's what you'll never reach up to, not if you're the biggest doctor in the world." He laughed. "By the way, how's Jem getting along? Still practising at Totnes?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes," I said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Doing well?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Oh! So—so! You see, we haven't got seven thousand a year, but we've got five hundred each, and Jem's more interested in hunting than in doctoring. He wants me to go into partnership with him. But I don't see myself."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Ambitious, eh, like I was? Got your degree in Edinburgh?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">I nodded, but modestly disclaimed being ambitious like he was.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"And your sister Lilian?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"She's keeping house for Jem."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Pretty girl, isn't she?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes," I said doubtfully. "Sings well, too."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"So you cultivate music down there?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Rather!" I said. "That is, Lilian does, and I do when I'm with her. We're pretty mad on it. I was dead set on hearing Rosetta Rosa in 'Lohengrin' to-night, but there isn't <a id="Page_12" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[12]"></a>a seat to be had. I suppose I shall push myself into the gallery."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"No, you won't," Sullivan put in sharply. "I've got a box. There'll be a chair for you. You'll see my wife. I should never have dreamt of going. Wagner bores me, though I must say I've got a few tips from him. But when we heard what a rush there was for seats Emmeline thought we ought to go, and I never cross her if I can help it. I made Smart give us a box."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I shall be delighted to come," I said. "There's only one Smart, I suppose? You mean Sir Cyril?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"The same, my boy. Lessee of the Opera, lessee of the Diana, lessee of the Folly, lessee of the Ottoman. If any one knows the color of his cheques I reckon it's me. He made me—that I will say; but I made him, too. Queer fellow! Awfully cute of him to get elected to the County Council. It was through him I met my wife. Did you ever see Emmeline when she was Sissie Vox?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I'm afraid I didn't."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You missed a treat, old man. There was no one to touch her in boys' parts in burlesque. A dashed fine woman she is—though <a id="Page_13" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[13]"></a>I say it, dashed fine!" He seemed to reflect a moment. "She's a spiritualist. I wish she wasn't. Spiritualism gets on her nerves. I've no use for it myself, but it's her life. It gives her fancies. She got some sort of a silly notion—don't tell her I said this, Carlie—about Rosetta Rosa. Says she's unlucky—Rosa, I mean. Wanted me to warn Smart against engaging her. Me! Imagine it! Why, Rosa will be the making of this opera season! She's getting a terrific salary, Smart told me."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It's awfully decent of you to offer me a seat," I began to thank him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Stuff!" he said. "Cost me nothing." A clock struck softly. "Christopher! it's half-past twelve, and I'm due at the Diana at twelve. We're rehearsing, you know."</p>
<p class="calibre4">We went out of the club arm in arm, Sullivan toying with his eye-glass.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Well, you'll toddle round to-night, eh? Just ask for my box. You'll find they'll look after you. So long!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">He walked off.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I say," he cried, returning hastily on his steps, and lowering his voice, "when you meet my wife, don't say anything about her theat<a id="Page_14" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[14]"></a>rical career. She don't like it. She's a great lady now. See?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Why, of course!" I agreed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He slapped me on the back and departed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It is easy to laugh at Sullivan. I could see that even then—perhaps more clearly then than now. But I insist that he was lovable. He had little directly to do with my immense adventure, but without him it could not have happened. And so I place him in the forefront of the narrative.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00013" class="calibre3">AT THE OPERA</h3>
<p class="calibre4">It was with a certain nervousness that I mentioned Sullivan's name to the gentleman at the receipt of tickets—a sort of transcendantly fine version of Keith Prowse's clerk—but Sullivan had not exaggerated his own importance. They did look after me. They looked after me with such respectful diligence that I might have been excused for supposing that they had mistaken me for the Shah of Persia in disguise. I was introduced into Sullivan's box with every circumstance of pomp. The box was empty. Naturally I had arrived there first. I sat down, and watched the enormous house fill, but not until I had glanced into the mirror that hung on the crimson partition of the box to make sure that my appearance did no discredit to Sullivan and the great lady, his wife.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At eight o'clock, when the conductor ap<a id="Page_16" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[16]"></a>peared at his desk to an accompaniment of applauding taps from the musicians, the house was nearly full. The four tiers sent forth a sparkle of diamonds, of silk, and of white arms and shoulders which rivalled the glitter of the vast crystal chandelier. The wide floor of serried stalls (those stalls of which one pair at least had gone for six pound ten) added their more sombre brilliance to the show, while far above, stretching away indefinitely to the very furthest roof, was the gallery (where but for Sullivan I should have been), a mass of black spotted with white faces.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Excitement was in the air: the expectation of seeing once again Rosetta Rosa, the girl with the golden throat, the mere girl who, two years ago, had in one brief month captured London, and who now, after a period of petulance, had decided to recapture London. On ordinary nights, for the inhabitants of boxes, the Opera is a social observance, an exhibition of jewels, something between an F.O. reception and a conversazione with music in the distance. But to-night the habitués confessed a genuine interest in the stage itself, abandoning their rôle of players. Dozens of times since then have I been to the Opera, and never have <a id="Page_17" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[17]"></a>I witnessed the candid enthusiasm of that night. If London can be naïve, it was naïve then.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The conductor raised his baton. The orchestra ceased its tuning. The lights were lowered. Silence and stillness enwrapped the auditorium. And the quivering violins sighed out the first chords of the "Lohengrin" overture. For me, then, there existed nothing save the voluptuous music, to which I abandoned myself as to the fascination of a dream. But not for long. Just as the curtain rose, the door behind me gave a click, and Sullivan entered in all his magnificence. I jumped up. On his arm in the semi-darkness I discerned a tall, olive-pale woman, with large handsome features of Jewish cast, and large, liquid black eyes. She wore a dead-white gown, and over this a gorgeous cloak of purple and mauve.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Emmeline, this is Carl," Sullivan whispered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She smiled faintly, giving me her finger-tips, and then she suddenly took a step forward as if the better to examine my face. Her strange eyes met mine. She gave a little indefinable unnecessary "Ah!" and sank down into a chair, loosing my hand swiftly. I was going <a id="Page_18" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[18]"></a>to say that she loosed my hand as if it had been the tail of a snake that she had picked up in mistake for something else. But that would leave the impression that her gesture was melodramatic, which it was not. Only there was in her demeanor a touch of the bizarre, ever so slight; yes, so slight that I could not be sure that I had not imagined it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"The wife's a bit overwrought," Sullivan murmured in my ear. "Nerves, you know. Women are like that. Wait till you're married. Take no notice. She'll be all right soon."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I nodded and sat down. In a moment the music had resumed its sway over me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I shall never forget my first sight of Rosetta Rosa as, robed with the modesty which the character of Elsa demands, she appeared on the stage to answer the accusation of Ortrud. For some moments she hesitated in the background, and then timidly, yet with what grandeur of mien, advanced towards the king. I knew then, as I know now, that hers was a loveliness of that imperious, absolute, dazzling kind which banishes from the hearts of men all moral conceptions, all considerations of right and wrong, and leaves therein nothing but worship and desire. Her acting, as she <a id="Page_19" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[19]"></a>replied by gesture to the question of the king, was perfect in its realization of the simplicity of Elsa. Nevertheless I, at any rate, as I searched her features through the lorgnon that Mrs. Sullivan had silently handed to me, could descry beneath the actress the girl—the spoilt and splendid child of Good Fortune, who in the very spring of youth had tasted the joy of sovereign power, that unique and terrible dominion over mankind which belongs to beauty alone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Such a face as hers once seen is engraved eternally on the memory of its generation. And yet when, in a mood of lyrical and rapt ecstasy, she began her opening song, "In Lichter Waffen Scheine," her face was upon the instant forgotten. She became a Voice—pure, miraculous, all-compelling; and the listeners seemed to hold breath while the matchless melody wove round them its persuasive spell.</p>
<hr class="c1"/>
<p class="calibre4">The first act was over, and Rosetta Rosa stood at the footlights bowing before the rolling and thunderous storms of applause, her hand in the hand of Alresca, the Lohengrin. That I have not till this moment mentioned <a id="Page_20" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[20]"></a>Alresca, and that I mention him now merely as the man who happened to hold Rosa's hand, shows with what absolute sovereignty Rosa had dominated the scene. For as Rosa was among sopranos, so was Alresca among tenors—the undisputed star. Without other aid Alresca could fill the opera-house; did he not receive two hundred and fifty pounds a night? To put him in the same cast as Rosa was one of Cyril Smart's lavish freaks of expense.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As these two stood together Rosetta Rosa smiled at him; he gave her a timid glance and looked away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When the clapping had ceased and the curtain hid the passions of the stage, I turned with a sigh of exhaustion and of pleasure to my hostess, and I was rather surprised to find that she showed not a trace of the nervous excitement which had marked her entrance into the box. She sat there, an excellent imitation of a woman of fashion, languid, unmoved, apparently a little bored, but finely conscious of doing the right thing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It's a treat to see any one enjoy anything as you enjoy this music," she said to me. She spoke well, perhaps rather too carefully, and with a hint of the cockney accent.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_21" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[21]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"It runs in the family, you know, Mrs. Smith," I replied, blushing for the ingenuousness which had pleased her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Don't call me Mrs. Smith; call me Emmeline, as we are cousins. I shouldn't at all like it if I mightn't call you Carl. Carl is such a handsome name, and it suits you. Now, doesn't it, Sully?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes, darling," Sullivan answered nonchalantly. He was at the back of the box, and clearly it was his benevolent desire to give me fair opportunity of a tête-à-tête with his dark and languorous lady. Unfortunately, I was quite unpractised in the art of maintaining a tête-à-tête with dark and languorous ladies. Presently he rose.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I must look up Smart," he said, and left us.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Sullivan has been telling me about you. What a strange meeting! And so you are a doctor! You don't know how young you look. Why, I am old enough to be your mother!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Oh, no, you aren't," I said. At any rate, I knew enough to say that.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And she smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Personally," she went on, "I hate music—loathe it. But it's Sullivan's trade, and, of course, one must come here."</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_22" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[22]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">She waved a jewelled arm towards the splendid animation of the auditorium.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"But surely, Emmeline," I cried protestingly, "you didn't 'loathe' that first act. I never heard anything like it. Rosa was simply—well, I can't describe it."</p>
<p class="calibre4">She gazed at me, and a cloud of melancholy seemed to come into her eyes. And after a pause she said, in the strangest tone, very quietly:</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You're in love with her already."</p>
<p class="calibre4">And her eyes continued to hold mine.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Who could help it?" I laughed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She leaned towards me, and her left hand hung over the edge of the box.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Women like Rosetta Rosa ought to be killed!" she said, with astonishing ferocity. Her rich, heavy contralto vibrated through me. She was excited again, that was evident. The nervous mood had overtaken her. The long pendent lobes of her ears crimsoned, and her opulent bosom heaved. I was startled. I was rather more than startled—I was frightened. I said to myself, "What a peculiar creature!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Why?" I questioned faintly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Because they are too young, too lovely, too dangerous," she responded with fierce em<a id="Page_23" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[23]"></a>phasis. "And as for Rosa in particular—as for Rosa in particular—if you knew what I knew, what I've seen——"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What have you seen?" I was bewildered. I began to wish that Sullivan had not abandoned me to her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Perhaps I'm wrong," she laughed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She laughed, and sat up straight again, and resumed her excellent imitation of the woman of fashion, while I tried to behave as though I had found nothing singular in her behavior.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You know about our reception?" she asked vivaciously in another moment, playing with her fan.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I'm afraid I don't."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Where have you been, Carl?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I've been in Edinburgh," I said, "for my final."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Oh!" she said. "Well, it's been paragraphed in all the papers. Sullivan is giving a reception in the Gold Rooms of the Grand Babylon Hotel. Of course, it will be largely theatrical,—Sullivan has to mix a good deal with that class, you know; it's his business,—but there will be a lot of good people there. You'll come, won't you? It's to celebrate the <a id="Page_24" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[24]"></a>five hundredth performance of 'My Queen.' Rosetta Rosa is coming."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I shall be charmed. But I should have thought you wouldn't ask Rosa after what you've just said."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Not ask Rosa! My dear Carl, she simply won't go anywhere. I know for a fact she declined Lady Casterby's invitation to meet a Serene Highness. Sir Cyril got her for me. She'll be the star of the show."</p>
<p class="calibre4">The theatre darkened once more. There were the usual preliminaries, and the orchestra burst into the prelude of the second act.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Have you ever done any crystal-gazing?" Emmeline whispered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And some one on the floor of the house hissed for silence.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I shook my head.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You must try." Her voice indicated that she was becoming excited again. "At my reception there will be a spiritualism room. I'm a believer, you know."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I nodded politely, leaning over the front of the box to watch the conductor.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then she set herself to endure the music.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Immediately the second act was over, Sullivan returned, bringing with him a short, slight, <a id="Page_25" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[25]"></a>bald-headed man of about fifty. The two were just finishing a conversation on some stage matter.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Smart, let me introduce to you my cousin, Carl Foster. Carl, this is Sir Cyril Smart."</p>
<p class="calibre4">My first feeling was one of surprise that a man so celebrated should be so insignificant to the sight. Yet as he looked at me I could somehow feel that here was an intelligence somewhat out of the common. At first he said little, and that little was said chiefly to my cousin's wife, but there was a quietude and firmness in his speech which had their own effect.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sir Cyril had small eyes, and small features generally, including rather a narrow forehead. His nostrils, however, were well curved, and his thin, straight lips and square chin showed the stiffest determination. He looked fatigued, weary, and harassed; yet it did not appear that he complained of his lot; rather accepted it with sardonic humor. The cares of an opera season and of three other simultaneous managements weighed on him ponderously, but he supported the burden with stoicism.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What is the matter with Alresca to-night?" Sullivan asked. "Suffering the pangs of jealousy, I suppose."</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_26" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[26]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"Alresca," Sir Cyril replied, "is the greatest tenor living, and to-night he sings like a variety comedian. But it is not jealousy. There is one thing about Alresca that makes me sometimes think he is not an artist at all—he is incapable of being jealous. I have known hundreds of singers, and he is the one solitary bird among them of that plumage. No, it is not jealousy."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Then what is it?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I wish I knew. He asked me to go and dine with him this afternoon. You know he dines at four o'clock. Of course, I went. What do you think he wanted me to do? He actually suggested that I should change the bill to-night! That showed me that something really was the matter, because he's the most modest and courteous man I have ever known, and he has a horror of disappointing the public. I asked him if he was hoarse. No. I asked him if he felt ill. No. But he was extremely depressed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"'I'm quite well,' he said, 'and yet—' Then he stopped. 'And yet what?' It seemed as if I couldn't drag it out of him. Then all of a sudden he told me. 'My dear Smart,' he said, 'there is a misfortune coming to me. I <a id="Page_27" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[27]"></a>feel it.' That's just what he said—'There's a misfortune coming to me. I feel it.' He's superstitious. They all are. Naturally, I set to work to soothe him. I did what I could. I talked about his liver in the usual way. But it had less than the usual effect. However, I persuaded him not to force me to change the bill."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Mrs. Sullivan struck into the conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"He isn't in love with Rosa, is he?" she demanded brusquely.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"In love with Rosa? Of course he isn't, my pet!" said Sullivan.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The wife glared at her husband as if angry, and Sullivan made a comic gesture of despair with his hands.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Is he?" Mrs. Sullivan persisted, waiting for Smart's reply.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I never thought of that," said Sir Cyril simply. "No; I should say not, decidedly not.... He may be, after all. I don't know. But if he were, that oughtn't to depress him. Even Rosa ought to be flattered by the admiration of a man like Alresca. Besides, so far as I know, they've seen very little of each other. They're too expensive to sing together often. There's only myself and Conried of New York who would dream of putting them in the same <a id="Page_28" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[28]"></a>bill. I should say they hadn't sung together more than two or three times since the death of Lord Clarenceux; so, even if he has been making love to her, she's scarcely had time to refuse him—eh?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"If he has been making love to Rosa," said Mrs. Sullivan slowly, "whether she has refused him or not, it's a misfortune for him, that's all."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Oh, you women! you women!" Sullivan smiled. "How fond you are of each other."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Mrs. Sullivan disdained to reply to her spouse.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"And, let me tell you," she added, "he has been making love to her."</p>
<p class="calibre4">The talk momentarily ceased, and in order to demonstrate that I was not tongue-tied in the company of these celebrities, I ventured to inquire what Lord Clarenceux, whose riches and eccentricities had reached even the Scottish newspapers, had to do with the matter.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Lord Clarenceux was secretly engaged to Rosa in Vienna," Sir Cyril replied. "That was about two and a half years ago. He died shortly afterwards. It was a terrible shock for her. Indeed, I have always thought that the shock had something to do with her notorious quarrel with us. She isn't naturally quarrel<a id="Page_29" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[29]"></a>some, so far as I can judge, though really I have seen very little of her."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"By the way, what was the real history of that quarrel?" said Sullivan. "I only know the beginning of it, and I expect Carl doesn't know even that, do you, Carl?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"No," I murmured modestly. "But perhaps it's a State secret."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Not in the least," Sir Cyril said, turning to me. "I first heard Rosa in Genoa—the opera-house there is more of a barn even than this, and a worse stage than this used to be, if that's possible. She was nineteen. Of course, I knew instantly that I had met with the chance of my life. In my time I have discovered eleven stars, but this was a sun. I engaged her at once, and she appeared here in the following July. She sang twelve times, and—well, you know the sensation there was. I had offered her twenty pounds a night in Genoa, and she seemed mighty enchanted.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"After her season here I offered her two hundred pounds a night for the following year; but Lord Clarenceux had met her then, and she merely said she would think it over. She wouldn't sign a contract. I was annoyed. My motto is, 'Never be annoyed,' but I was. Next <a id="Page_30" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[30]"></a>to herself, she owed everything to me. She went to Vienna to fulfil an engagement, and Lord Clarenceux after her. I followed. I saw her, and I laid myself out to arrange terms of peace.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I have had difficulties with prime donne before, scores of times. Yes; I have had experience." He laughed sardonically. "I thought I knew what to do. Generally a prima donna has either a pet dog or a pet parrot—sopranos go in for dogs, contraltos seem to prefer parrots. I have made a study of these agreeable animals, and I have found that through them their mistresses can be approached when all other avenues are closed. I can talk doggily to poodles in five languages, and in the art of administering sugar to the bird I am, I venture to think, unrivalled. But Rosa had no pets. And after a week's negotiation, I was compelled to own myself beaten. It was a disadvantage to me that she wouldn't lose her temper. She was too polite; she really was grateful for what I had done for her. She gave me no chance to work on her feelings. But beyond all this there was something strange about Rosa, something I have never been able to fathom. She isn't a child like <a id="Page_31" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[31]"></a>most of 'em. She's as strong-headed as I am myself, every bit!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">He paused, as if inwardly working at the problem.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Well, and how did you make it up?" Sullivan asked briskly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(As for me, I felt as if I had come suddenly into the centre of the great world.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Oh, nothing happened for a time. She sang in Paris and America, and took her proper place as the first soprano in the world. I did without her, and managed very well. Then early this spring she sent her agent to see me, and offered to sing ten times for three thousand pounds. They can't keep away from London, you know. New York and Chicago are all very well for money, but if they don't sing in London people ask 'em why. I wanted to jump at the offer, but I pretended not to be eager. Up till then she had confined herself to French operas; so I said that London wouldn't stand an exclusively French repertoire from any one, and would she sing in 'Lohengrin.' She would. I suggested that she should open with 'Lohengrin,' and she agreed. The price was stiffish, but I didn't quarrel with that. I never drive bargains. She is twenty-two now, <a id="Page_32" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[32]"></a>or twenty-three; in a few more years she will want five hundred pounds a night, and I shall have to pay it."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"And how did she meet you?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"With just the same cold politeness. And I understand her less than ever."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"She isn't English, I suppose?" I put in.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"English!" Sir Cyril ejaculated. "No one ever heard of a great English soprano. Unless you count Australia as England, and Australia wouldn't like that. No. That is another of her mysteries. No one knows where she emerged from. She speaks English and French with absolute perfection. Her Italian accent is beautiful. She talks German freely, but badly. I have heard that she speaks perfect Flemish,—which is curious,—but I do not know."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Well," said Sullivan, nodding his head, "give me the theatrical as opposed to the operatic star. The theatrical star's bad enough, and mysterious enough, and awkward enough. But, thank goodness, she isn't polite—at least, those at the Diana aren't. You can speak your mind to 'em. And that reminds me, Smart, about that costume of Effie's in the <a id="Page_33" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[33]"></a>first act of 'My Queen.' Of course you'll insist—"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Don't talk your horrid shop now, Sullivan," his wife said; and Sullivan didn't.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The prelude to the third act was played, and the curtain went up on the bridal chamber of Elsa and Lohengrin. Sir Cyril Smart rose as if to go, but lingered, eying the stage as a general might eye a battle-field from a neighboring hill. The music of the two processions was heard approaching from the distance. Then, to the too familiar strains of the wedding march, the ladies began to enter on the right, and the gentlemen on the left. Elsa appeared amid her ladies, but there was no Lohengrin in the other crowd. The double chorus proceeded, and then a certain excitement was visible on the stage, and the conductor made signs with his left hand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Smart, what's wrong? Where's Alresca?" It was Sullivan who spoke.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"He'll sail in all right," Sir Cyril said calmly. "Don't worry."</p>
<p class="calibre4">The renowned impresario had advanced nearer to the front of our box, and was standing immediately behind my chair. My heart was beating violently with apprehension under <a id="Page_34" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[34]"></a>my shirt-front. Where was Alresca? It was surely impossible that he should fail to appear! But he ought to have been on the stage, and he was not on the stage. I stole a glance at Sir Cyril's face. It was Napoleonic in its impassivity.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And I said to myself:</p>
<p class="calibre4">"He is used to this kind of thing. Naturally slips must happen sometimes."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Still, I could not control my excitement.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Emmeline's hand was convulsively clutching at the velvet-covered balustrade of the box.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It'll be all right," I repeated to myself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But when the moment came for the king to bless the bridal pair, and there was no Lohengrin to bless, even the impassive Sir Cyril seemed likely to be disturbed, and you could hear murmurs of apprehension from all parts of the house. The conductor, however, went doggedly on, evidently hoping for the best.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At last the end of the procession was leaving the stage, and Elsa was sitting on the bed alone. Still no Lohengrin. The violins arrived at the muted chord of B flat, which is Lohengrin's cue. They hung on it for a second, and then the conductor dropped his baton. A bell rang. The curtain descended. The lights <a id="Page_35" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[35]"></a>were turned up, and there was a swift loosing of tongues in the house. People were pointing to Sir Cyril in our box. As for him, he seemed to be the only unmoved person in the audience.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"That's never occurred before in my time," he said. "Alresca was not mistaken. Something has happened. I must go."</p>
<p class="calibre4">But he did not go. And I perceived that, though the calm of his demeanor was unimpaired, this unprecedented calamity had completely robbed him of his power of initiative. He could not move. He was nonplussed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The door of the box opened, and an official with a blazing diamond in his shirt-front entered hurriedly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What is it, Nolan?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"There's been an accident to Monsieur Alresca, Sir Cyril, and they want a doctor."</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was the chance of a lifetime! I ought to have sprung up and proudly announced, "I'm a doctor." But did I? No! I was so timid, I was so unaccustomed to being a doctor, that I dared not for the life of me utter a word. It was as if I was almost ashamed of being a doctor. I wonder if my state of mind will be understood.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Carl's a doctor," said Sullivan.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_36" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[36]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">How I blushed!</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Are you?" said Sir Cyril, suddenly emerging from his condition of suspended activity. "I never guessed it. Come along with us, will you?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"With pleasure," I answered as briskly as I could.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00015" class="calibre3">THE CRY OF ALRESCA</h3>
<p class="calibre4">As I left the box in the wake of Sir Cyril and Mr. Nolan, Sullivan jumped up to follow us, and the last words I heard were from Emmeline.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Sullivan, stay here. You shall not go near that woman," she exclaimed in feverish and appealing tones: excitement had once more overtaken her. And Sullivan stayed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Berger here?" Sir Cyril asked hurriedly of Nolan.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes, sir."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Send some one for him. I'll get him to take Alresca's part. He'll have to sing it in French, but that won't matter. We'll make a new start at the duet."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"But Rosa?" said Nolan.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Rosa! She's not hurt, is she?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"No, sir. But she's upset."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What the devil is she upset about?"</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_38" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[38]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"The accident. She's practically useless. We shall never persuade her to sing again to-night."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Oh, damn!" Sir Cyril exclaimed. And then quite quietly: "Well, run and tell 'em, then. Shove yourself in front of the curtain, my lad, and make a speech. Say it's nothing serious, but just sufficient to stop the performance. Apologize, grovel, flatter 'em, appeal to their generosity—you know."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes, Sir Cyril."</p>
<p class="calibre4">And Nolan disappeared on his mission of appeasing the audience.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We had traversed the flagged corridor. Sir Cyril opened a narrow door at the end.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Follow me," he called out. "This passage is quite dark, but quite straight."</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was not a passage; it was a tunnel. I followed the sound of his footsteps, my hands outstretched to feel a wall on either side. It seemed a long way, but suddenly we stepped into twilight. There was a flight of steps which we descended, and at the foot of the steps a mutilated commissionaire, ornamented with medals, on guard.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Where is Monsieur Alresca?" Sir Cyril demanded.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_39" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[39]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"Behind the back-cloth, where he fell, sir," answered the commissionaire, saluting.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I hurried after Sir Cyril, and found myself amid a most extraordinary scene of noise and confusion on the immense stage. The entire personnel of the house seemed to be present: a crowd apparently consisting of thousands of people, and which really did comprise some hundreds. Never before had I had such a clear conception of the elaborate human machinery necessary to the production of even a comparatively simple lyric work like "Lohengrin." Richly clad pages and maids of honor, all white and gold and rouge, mingled with shirt-sleeved carpenters and scene-shifters in a hysterical rabble; chorus-masters, footmen in livery, loungers in evening dress, girls in picture hats, members of the orchestra with instruments under their arms, and even children, added variety to the throng. And, round about, gigantic "flats" of wood and painted canvas rose to the flies, where their summits were lost in a maze of ropes and pulleys. Beams of light, making visible great clouds of dust, shot forth from hidden sources. Voices came down from the roof, and from far <a id="Page_40" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[40]"></a>below ascended the steady pulsation of a dynamo. I was bewildered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sir Cyril pushed ahead, without saying a word, without even remonstrating when his minions omitted to make way for him. Right at the back of the stage, and almost in the centre, the crowd was much thicker. And at last, having penetrated it, we came upon a sight which I am not likely to forget. Rosa, in all the splendor of the bridal costume, had passed her arms under Alresca's armpits, and so raised his head and shoulders against her breast. She was gazing into the face of the spangled knight, and the tears were falling from her eyes into his.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"My poor Alresca! My poor Alresca!" she kept murmuring.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Pressing on these two were a distinguished group consisting of the King, the Herald, Ortrud, Telramund, and several more. And Ortrud was cautiously feeling Alresca's limbs with her jewel-laden fingers. I saw instantly that Alresca was unconscious.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Please put him down, mademoiselle."</p>
<p class="calibre4">These were the first words that I ever spoke to Rosetta Rosa, and, out of sheer acute nervousness, I uttered them roughly, in a tone of <a id="Page_41" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[41]"></a>surly command. I was astonished at myself. I was astonished at my own voice. She glanced up at me and hesitated. No doubt she was unaccustomed to such curt orders.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Please put him down at once," I repeated, trying to assume a bland, calm, professional, authoritative manner, and not in the least succeeding. "It is highly dangerous to lift an unconscious person from a recumbent position."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Why I should have talked like an article in a medical dictionary instead of like a human being I cannot imagine.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"This is a doctor—Mr. Carl Foster," Sir Cyril explained smoothly, and she laid Alresca's head gently on the bare planks of the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Will everyone kindly stand aside, and I will examine him."</p>
<p class="calibre4">No one moved. The King continued his kingly examination of the prone form. Not a fold of Ortrud's magnificent black robe was disturbed. Then Sir Cyril translated my request into French and into German, and these legendary figures of the Middle Ages withdrew a little, fixing themselves with difficulty into the common multitude that pressed on <a id="Page_42" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[42]"></a>them from without. I made them retreat still further. Rosetta Rosa moved gravely to one side.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Almost immediately Alresca opened his eyes, and murmured faintly, "My thigh."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I knelt down, but not before Rosa had sprung forward at the sound of his voice, and kneeling close by my side had clasped his hand. I tried to order her away, but my tongue could not form the words. I could only look at her mutely, and there must have been an effective appeal in my eyes, for she got up, nodding an acquiescence, and stood silent and tense a yard from Alresca's feet. With a violent effort I nerved myself to perform my work. The voice of Nolan, speaking to the audience, and then a few sympathetic cheers, came vaguely from the other side of the big curtain, and then the orchestra began to play the National Anthem.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The left thigh was broken near the knee-joint. So much I ascertained at once. As I manipulated the limb to catch the sound of the crepitus the injured man screamed, and he was continually in very severe pain. He did not, however, again lose consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I must have a stretcher, and he must be <a id="Page_43" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[43]"></a>carried to a room. I can't do anything here," I said to Sir Cyril. "And you had better send for a first-rate surgeon. Sir Francis Shorter would do very well—102 Manchester Square, I think the address is. Tell him it's a broken thigh. It will be a serious case."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Let me send for my doctor—Professor Eugene Churt," Rosa said. "No one could be more skilful."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Pardon me," I protested, "Professor Churt is a physician of great authority, but he is not a surgeon, and here he would be useless."</p>
<p class="calibre4">She bowed—humbly, as I thought.</p>
<p class="calibre4">With such materials as came to hand I bound Alresca's legs together, making as usual the sound leg fulfil the function of a splint to the other one, and he was placed on a stretcher. It was my first case, and it is impossible for me to describe my shyness and awkwardness as the men who were to carry the stretcher to the dressing-room looked silently to me for instructions.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Now," I said, "take short steps, keep your knees bent, but don't on any account keep step. As gently as you can—all together—lift."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rosa followed the little procession as it <a id="Page_44" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[44]"></a>slowly passed through the chaotic anarchy of the stage. Alresca was groaning, his eyes closed. Suddenly he opened them, and it seemed as though he caught sight of her for the first time. He lifted his head, and the sweat stood in drops on his brow.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Send her away!" he cried sharply, in an agony which was as much mental as physical. "She is fatal to me."</p>
<p class="calibre4">The bearers stopped in alarm at this startling outburst; but I ordered them forward, and turned to Rosa. She had covered her face with her hands, and was sobbing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Please go away," I said. "It is very important he should not be agitated."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Without quite intending to do so, I touched her on the shoulder.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Alresca doesn't mean that!" she stammered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her blue eyes were fixed on me, luminous through her tears, and I feasted on all the lovely curves of that incomparable oval which was her face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I am sure he doesn't," I answered. "But you had better go, hadn't you?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes," she said, "I will go."</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_45" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[45]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"Forgive my urgency," I murmured. Then she drew back and vanished in the throng.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the calm of the untidy dressing-room, with the aid of Alresca's valet, I made my patient as comfortable as possible on a couch. And then I had one of the many surprises of my life. The door opened, and old Toddy entered. No inhabitant of the city of Edinburgh would need explanations on the subject of Toddy MacWhister. The first surgeon of Scotland, his figure is familiar from one end of the town to the other—and even as far as Leith and Portobello. I trembled. And my reason for trembling was that the celebrated bald expert had quite recently examined me for my Final in surgery. On that dread occasion I had made one bad blunder, so ridiculous that Toddy's mood had passed suddenly from grim ferociousness to wild northern hilarity. I think I am among the few persons in the world who have seen and heard Toddy MacWhister laugh.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I hoped that he would not remember me, but, like many great men, he had a disconcertingly good memory for faces.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Ah!" he said, "I've seen ye before."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You have, sir."</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_46" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[46]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"You are the callant who told me that the medulla oblongata—"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Please—" I entreated.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Perhaps he would not have let me off had not Sir Cyril stood immediately behind him. The impresario explained that Toddy MacWhister (the impresario did not so describe him) had been in the audience, and had offered his services.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What is it?" asked Toddy, approaching Alresca.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Fracture of the femur."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Simple, of course."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes, sir, but so far as I can judge, of a somewhat peculiar nature. I've sent round to King's College Hospital for splints and bandages."</p>
<p class="calibre4">Toddy took off his coat.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"We sha'n't need ye, Sir Cyril," said he casually.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And Sir Cyril departed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In an hour the limb was set—a masterly display of skill—and, except to give orders, Toddy had scarcely spoken another word. As he was washing his hands in a corner of the dressing-room he beckoned to me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"How was it caused?" he whispered.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_47" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[47]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"No one seems to know, sir."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Doesn't matter much, anyway! Let him lie a wee bit, and then get him home. Ye'll have no trouble with him, but there'll be no more warbling and cutting capers for him this yet awhile."</p>
<p class="calibre4">And Toddy, too, went. He had showed not the least curiosity as to Alresca's personality, and I very much doubt whether he had taken the trouble to differentiate between the finest tenor in Europe and a chorus-singer. For Toddy, Alresca was simply an individual who sang and cut capers.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I made the necessary dispositions for the transport of Alresca in an hour's time to his flat in the Devonshire Mansion, and then I sat down near him. He was white and weak, but perfectly conscious. He had proved himself to be an admirable patient. Even in the very crisis of the setting his personal distinction and his remarkable and finished politeness had suffered no eclipse. And now he lay there, with his silky mustache disarranged and his hair damp, exactly as I had once seen him on the couch in the garden by the sea in the third act of "Tristan," the picture of nobility. He could not move, for the sufficient reason that <a id="Page_48" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[48]"></a>a strong splint ran from his armpit to his ankle, but his arms were free, and he raised his left hand, and beckoned me with an irresistible gesture to come quite close to him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I smiled encouragingly and obeyed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"My kind friend," he murmured, "I know not your name."</p>
<p class="calibre4">His English was not the English of an Englishman, but it was beautiful in its exotic quaintness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"My name is Carl Foster," I said. "It will be better for you not to talk."</p>
<p class="calibre4">He made another gesture of protest with that wonderful left hand of his.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Monsieur Foster, I must talk to Mademoiselle Rosa."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Impossible," I replied. "It really is essential that you should keep quiet."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Kind friend, grant me this wish. When I have seen her I shall be better. It will do me much good."</p>
<p class="calibre4">There was such a desire in his eyes, such a persuasive plaintiveness in his voice, that, against my judgment, I yielded.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Very well," I said. "But I am afraid I can only let you see her for five minutes."</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_49" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[49]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">The hand waved compliance, and I told the valet to go and inquire for Rosa.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"She is here, sir," said the valet on opening the door. I jumped up. There she was, standing on the door-mat in the narrow passage! Yet I had been out of the room twice, once to speak to Sir Cyril Smart, and once to answer an inquiry from my cousin Sullivan, and I had not seen her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was still in the bridal costume of Elsa, and she seemed to be waiting for permission to enter. I went outside to her, closing the door.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Sir Cyril would not let me come," she said. "But I have escaped him. I was just wondering if I dared peep in. How is he?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"He is getting on splendidly," I answered. "And he wants to have a little chat with you."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"And may he?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"If you will promise to be very, very ordinary, and not to excite him."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I promise," she said with earnestness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Remember," I added, "quite a little, tiny chat!"</p>
<p class="calibre4">She nodded and went in, I following. Upon catching sight of her, Alresca's face broke into an exquisite, sad smile. Then he gave his <a id="Page_50" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[50]"></a>valet a glance, and the valet crept from the room. I, as in professional duty bound, remained. The most I could do was to retire as far from the couch, and pretend to busy myself with the rolling up of spare bandages.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"My poor Rosa," I heard Alresca begin.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The girl had dropped to her knees by his side, and taken his hand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"How did it happen, Alresca? Tell me."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I cannot tell you! I saw—saw something, and I fell, and caught my leg against some timber, and I don't remember any more."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Saw something? What did you see?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">There was a silence.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Were you frightened?" Rosa continued softly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then another silence.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes," said Alresca at length, "I was frightened."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What was it?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I say I cannot tell you. I do not know."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You are keeping something from me, Alresca," she exclaimed passionately.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was on the point of interfering in order to bring the colloquy to an end, but I hesitated. They appeared to have forgotten that I was there.</p>
<p class="calibre4"><a id="Page_51" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[51]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre4">"How so?" said Alresca in a curious whisper. "I have nothing to keep from you, my dear child."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Yes," she said, "you are keeping something from me. This afternoon you told Sir Cyril that you were expecting a misfortune. Well, the misfortune has occurred to you. How did you guess that it was coming? Then, to-night, as they were carrying you away on that stretcher, do you remember what you said?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"What did I say?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You remember, don't you?" Rosa faltered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I remember," he admitted. "But that was nonsense. I didn't know what I was saying. My poor Rosa, I was delirious. And that is just why I wished to see you—in order to explain to you that that was nonsense. You must forget what I said. Remember only that I love you."</p>
<p class="calibre4">("So Emmeline was right," I reflected.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">Abruptly Rosa stood up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"You must not love me, Alresca," she said in a shaking voice. "You ask me to forget something; I will try. You, too, must forget something—your love."</p>
<p class="calibre4">"But last night," he cried, in accents of an <a id="Page_52" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1" title="[52]"></a>almost intolerable pathos—"last night, when I hinted—you did not—did not speak like this, Rosetta."</p>
<p class="calibre4">I rose. I had surely no alternative but to separate them. If I allowed the interview to be prolonged the consequences to my patient might be extremely serious. Yet again I hesitated. It was the sound of Rosa's sobbing that arrested me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Once more she dropped to her knees.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Alresca!" she moaned.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He seized her hand and kissed it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And then I came forward, summoning all my courage to assert the doctor's authority. And in the same instant Alresca's features, which had been the image of intense joy, wholly changed their expression, and were transformed into the embodiment of fear. With a look of frightful terror he pointed with one white hand to the blank wall opposite. He tried to sit up, but the splint prevented him. Then his head fell back.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"It is there!" he moaned. "Fatal! My Rosa—"</p>
<p class="calibre4">The words died in his mouth, and he swooned.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As for Rosetta Rosa, I led her from the room.</p>
