<p class="calibre1">In Benares, the sacred city of the Hindus, situated in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, there is a house which is famed pretty far and wide. It is said that the house is haunted and that no human being can pass a night in that house.</p>
<p class="tbrk">Once there was a large Bridal party.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In India the custom is that the bridegroom goes to the house of the bride with great pomp and show with a number of friends and followers and the ceremony of "Kanya Dan" (giving away the girl) takes place at the bride's house.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The number of the people who go with the bridegroom depends largely upon the means of the bride's party, because the guests who come with the groom are to be fed and entertained in right regal style. It is this feeding and entertaining the guests that makes a daughter's marriage so costly in India, to a certain extent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If the bride and the bridegroom live in the same town or village then the bridegroom's party goes to the bride's house in the evening, the <a id="Page_103" title="[Pg 103]"></a>marriage is performed at night and they all come away the same night or early the next morning. If, however, the places of residence of the bride and the bridegroom are say 500 miles apart as is generally the case, the bridegroom with his party goes a day or two earlier and stays a day or two after the marriage. The bride's people have to find accommodation, food and entertainment for the whole period, which in the case of rich people extends over a week.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now I had the pleasure of joining such a bridal party as mentioned last, going to Benares.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We were about thirty young men, besides a number of elderly people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Since the young men could not be merry in the presence of their elders the bride's father, who was a very rich man, had made arrangements to put up the thirty of us in a separate house.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This house was within a few yards of the famed haunted house.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We reached Benares at about ten in the morning and it was about three in the afternoon that we were informed that the celebrated haunted house was close by. Naturally some of us decided that we should occupy that house rather than the one in <a id="Page_104" title="[Pg 104]"></a>which we were. I myself was not very keen on shifting but a few others were. Our host protested but we insisted, and so the host had to give way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The house was empty and the owner was a local gentleman, a resident of Benares.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To procure his permission and the key was the work of a few minutes and we took actual possession of the house at about six in the evening. It was a very large house with big rooms and halls (rather poorly furnished) but some furniture was brought in from the house which we had occupied on our arrival.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a very big and well-ventilated hall and in this we decided to sleep. Carpet upon carpet was piled on the floor and there we decided to sleep (on the ground) in right Oriental style. Lamps were brought and the house was lighted up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At about 9 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> our dinner was announced. The Oriental dinner is conducted as follows:—</p>
<p class="calibre1">The guests all sit on the floor and a big plate of metal (say 20" in diameter) is placed in front of each guest. Then the service commences and the plates are filled with dainties. Each guest <a id="Page_105" title="[Pg 105]"></a>generally gets thrice as much as he can eat. Then the host who does not himself join stands with joined hands and requests the guests to do full justice, and the dinner begins. Very little is eaten in fact, and whatever is left goes to the poor. That is probably the only consolation. Now on this particular occasion the bride's father, who was our host and who was an elderly gentleman had withdrawn, leaving two of his sons to look after us. He himself, we understood, was looking after his more elderly guests who had been lodged in a different house.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The hall in which we sat down to dine was a large one and very well lighted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Adjoining it was the hall in which our beds had been made. The sons of <i class="calibre10">mine host</i> with a number of others were serving. I always was rather unconventional. So I asked my fellow guests whether I could fall to, and without waiting for permission I commenced eating, a very good thing I did, as would appear hereafter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In about 20 minutes the serving was over and we were asked to begin. As a matter of fact I was nearly half through at that time. And then the trouble began.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="Page_106" title="[Pg 106]"></a>With a click all the lights went out and the whole house was in total darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, the reader can guess what followed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who has put out the lights?" shouted Jagat, who was sitting next but one to me on the left.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The ghost" shouted another in reply.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I shall kill him if I can catch him" shouted Jagat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The whole place was in darkness, we could not see anything but we could hear that Jagat was trying to get up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he received what was a stunning blow on his back. We could hear the thump.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh" shouted Jagat "who is that?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">He sat down again and gave the man on his right a blow like the one he had received. The man on the right protested. Then Jagat turned to the man on his left. The man on Jagat's left evidently resisted and Jagat had the worst of it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then Narain, another one of us shouted out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What is the matter with you?" asked his neighbour.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why did you pull my hair" shouted Narain.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I did not pull" shouted the neighbour.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="Page_107" title="[Pg 107]"></a>Then a servant was seen approaching with a lamp and things became quiet.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But the servant did not reach the hall. He stumbled against something and fell headlong on the ground, the lamp went out, and our trouble began again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the party received a slap on the back of his head which sent his cap rolling and in his attempt to recover it he upset a glass of water that was near his right hand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Matters went on in this fashion till a lamp came. The whole thing must have taken about 4 minutes. When the lamp came we found that all the dishes were clean.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The eatables had mysteriously disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The sons of <i class="calibre10">mine host</i> looked stupidly at us and we looked stupidly at them and at each other. But there it was, there was not a particle of solid food left.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We had therefore no alternative but to adjourn to the nearest confectioner's shop and eat some sweets there. That the night would not pass in peace we were sure; but nobody dared suggest that we should not pass the night in the <a id="Page_108" title="[Pg 108]"></a>haunted house. Once having defied the Ghost we had to stand to our guns for one night at least.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was well after 11 o'clock at night when we came back and went to bed. We went to bed but not to sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The room in which we all slept was a big one as I have said already, and there were two wall lamps in it. We lowered the lamps and—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then the lamps went out, and we began to anticipate trouble. Our hosts had all gone home leaving us to the tender mercies of the Ghost.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shortly afterwards we began to feel as if we were lying on a public road and horses passing along the road within a yard of us. We also imagined we could hear men passing close to us whispering. Sleeping was impossible. We all remained awake talking about different things, till a horse came very near. And thus the night passed away. At about four in the morning one of us got up and wanted to go out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We shouted for the servant called Kallu and within a minute Kallu came with a lantern. One of our fellow guests got up and went out of the room followed by Kallu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We could hear him going along the dining hall to the head of the stairs. Then we heard him <a id="Page_109" title="[Pg 109]"></a>shriek. We all rushed out. The lighted lantern was there at the head of the stairs and our fellow guest at the bottom. Kallu had vanished.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We rushed down, picked up our friend and carried him upstairs. He said that Kallu had given him a push and he had fallen down. Fortunately he was not hurt. We called the servants and they all came, Kallu among them. He denied having come with a lantern or having pushed our friend down the stairs. The other servants corroborated his statement. They assured us that Kallu had never left the room in which they all were.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We were satisfied that this was also a ghostly trick.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At about seven in the morning when our hosts came we were glad to bid good-bye to the haunted house with our bones whole.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The funniest thing was that only those of my fellow guests had the worst of it who had denied the existence of Ghosts. Those of us who had kept respectfully silent had not been touched.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Those who had received a blow or two averred that the blows could not have been given by invisible hands inasmuch as the blows were too <a id="Page_110" title="[Pg 110]"></a>substantial. But all of us were certain that it was no trick played by a human being.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The passing horses and the whispering passers-by had given us a queer creepy sensation.</p>
<p class="tbrk">In this connection may be mentioned a few haunted houses in other parts of India. There are one or two very well-known haunted houses in Calcutta.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "Hastings House" is one of them. It is situated at Alipore in the Southern suburb of Calcutta. This is a big palatial building now owned by the Government of Bengal. At one time it was the private residence of the Governor-General of India whose name it bears. At present it is used as the "State Guest House" in which the Indian Chiefs are put up when they come to pay official visits to His Excellency in Calcutta. It appears that in a lane not very far from this house was fought the celebrated duel between Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General of India and Sir Philip Francis, a Member of his Council and the reputed author of the "Letters of Junius."</p>
<p class="calibre1">While living in this house Warren Hastings married Baroness Imhoff sometime during the first <a id="Page_111" title="[Pg 111]"></a>fortnight of August about 140 years ago. "The event was celebrated by great festivities"; and, as expected, the bride came home in a splendid equipage. It is said that this scene is re-enacted on the anniversary of the wedding by supernatural agency and a ghostly carriage duly enters the gate in the evening once every year. The clatter of hoofs and the rattle of iron-tyred wheels are distinctly heard advancing up to the portico; then there is the sound of the opening and closing of the carriage door, and lastly the carriage proceeds onwards, but it does not come out from under the porch. It vanishes mysteriously.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To-day is the 15th of August and this famous equipage must have glided in and out to the utter bewilderment of watchful eyes and ears within the last fortnight.<a id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="part0002.html#Footnote_2_2">[2]</a></p>
<p class="tbrk">There is another well-known ghostly house in Calcutta in which the only trouble is that its windows in the first floor bedrooms open at night spontaneously.</p>
<p class="calibre1">People have slept at night for a reward in this house closing the windows with their own hands <a id="Page_112" title="[Pg 112]"></a>and have waked up at night shivering with cold to find all the windows open.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Once a body of soldiers went to pass a night in this house with a view to solve the mystery. They all sat in a room fully determined not to sleep but see what happened; and thus went on chatting till it was about midnight. There was a big lamp burning on a table around which they were seated. All of a sudden there was a loud click—the lamp went out and all the windows opened simultaneously. The next minute the lamp was alight again. The occupants of the room looked at their watches; it was about 1 A.M. The next night they sat up again and one of them with a revolver. At about one in the morning this particular individual pointed his revolver at one of the windows. As soon as the lamp went out this man pulled the trigger five times and there were five reports. The windows, however, opened and the lamp was alight again as on the previous night. They all rushed to the window to see if any damage had been done by the bullets.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The five bullets were found in the room but from their appearance it seemed as if they had struck nothing, evidently the bullets would have <a id="Page_113" title="[Pg 113]"></a>been changed in shape if they had impinged upon any hard substance. But then this was another enigma. How did the bullets come back? No man could have put the bullets there from before, (for they were still hot when discovered) or could have guessed the bore of the revolver that was going to be used.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the third night to make assurance doubly sure, these soldiers were again present in the room, but on this occasion they had loaded their revolver with marked bullets.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As it neared one o'clock, one of them pointed the revolver at the window. He had decided to pull the trigger as soon as the lamp would go out. But he could not. As soon as the lamp went out this soldier received a sharp cut on his wrist with a cane and the revolver fell clattering on the floor. The invisible hand had left its mark behind which his companions saw after the lamp was alight again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many people have subsequently tried to solve the mystery but never succeeded.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The house remained untenanted for a long time and finally it was rented by an Australian horse dealer who however did not venture to <a id="Page_114" title="[Pg 114]"></a>occupy the building itself, and contented himself with erecting his stables and offices in the compound where he is not molested by the unearthly visitors.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is another ghostly house and it is in the United Provinces. The name of the town has been intentionally omitted. Various people saw numerous things in that house but a correct report never came. Once a friend of mine passed a night in that house. He told me what he had seen. Most wonderful! And I have no reason to disbelieve him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I went to pass a night in that house and I had only a comfortable chair, a small table and a few magazines besides a loaded revolver. I had taken care to load that revolver myself so that there might be no trick and I had given everybody to understand that.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I began well. The night was cool and pleasant. The lamp bright—the chair comfortable and the magazine which I took up—interesting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But at about midnight I began to feel rather uneasy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"At one in the morning I should probably have left the place if I had not been afraid of <a id="Page_115" title="[Pg 115]"></a>friends whose servants I knew were watching the house and its front door.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"At half past one I heard a peculiar sigh of pain in the next room. 'This is rather interesting,' I thought. To face something tangible is comparatively easy; to wait for the unknown is much more difficult. I took out the revolver from my pocket and examined it. It looked quite all right—this small piece of metal which could have killed six men in half a minute. Then I waited—for what—well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"A couple of minutes of suspense and the sigh was repeated. I went to the door dividing the two rooms and pushed it open. A long thick ray of light at once penetrated the darkness, and I walked into the other room. It was only partially light. But after a minute I could see all the corners. There was nothing in that room.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I waited for a minute or two. Then I heard the sigh in the room which I had left. I came back,—stopped—rubbed my eyes—.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sitting in the chair which I had vacated not two minutes ago was a young girl calm, fair, beautiful with that painful expression on her face which could be more easily imagined than <a id="Page_116" title="[Pg 116]"></a>described. I had heard of her. So many others who had came to pass a night in that house had seen her and described her (and I had disbelieved).</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well—there she sat, calm, sad, beautiful, in my chair. If I had come in five minutes later I might have found her reading the magazine which I had left open, face downwards. When I was well within the room she stood up facing me and I stopped. The revolver fell from my hand. She smiled a sad sweet smile. How beautiful she was!</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then she spoke. A modern ghost speaking like Hamlet's father, just think of that!</p>
<blockquote class="calibre11"><div class="index">
<p class="calibre1">"'You will probably wonder why I am here—I shall tell you, I was murdered—by my own father.... I was a young widow living in this house which belonged to my father I became unchaste and to save his own name he poisoned me when I was <i class="calibre10">enceinte</i>—another week and I should have become a mother; but he poisoned me and my innocent child died too—it would have been such a beautiful baby—and you would probably want to kiss it'</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p class="calibre1">and horror of horrors, she took out the child from her womb and showed it to me. She began to move in my direction with the child in her arms saying—'You will like to kiss it.'</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't know whether I shouted—but I fainted.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="Page_117" title="[Pg 117]"></a>"When I recovered consciousness it was broad day-light, and I was lying on the floor, with the revolver by my side. I picked it up and slowly walked out of the house with as much dignity as I could command. At the door I met one of my friends to whom I told a lie that I had seen nothing.—It is the first time that I have told you what I saw at the place.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The Ghostly woman spoke the language of the part of the country in which the Ghostly house is situate."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The friend who told me this story is a responsible Government official and will not make a wrong statement. What has been written above has been confirmed by others—who had passed nights in that Ghostly house; but they had generally shouted for help and fainted at the sight of the ghost, and so they had not heard her story from her lips as reproduced here.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The house still exists, but it is now a dilapidated old affair, and the roof and the doors and windows are so bad that people don't care to go and pass a night there.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is also a haunted house in Assam. In this house a certain gentleman committed suicide by cutting his own throat with a razor.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="Page_118" title="[Pg 118]"></a>You often see him sitting on a cot in the verandah heaving deep sighs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mention of this house has been made in a book called "Tales from the Tiger Land" published in England. The Author says he has passed a night in the house in question and testifies to the accuracy of all the rumours that are current.</p>
<p class="tbrk">Talking about haunted houses reminds me of a haunted tank. I was visiting a friend of mine in the interior of Bengal during our annual summer holidays when I was yet a student. This friend of mine was the son of a rich man and in the village had a large ancestral house where his people usually resided. It was the first week of June when I reached my friend's house. I was informed that among other things of interest, which were, however, very few in that particular part of the country, there was a large Pukka tank belonging to my friend's people which was haunted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What kind of Ghost lived in the tank or near it nobody could say, but what everybody knew was this, that on <i class="calibre10">Jaistha Shukla Ekadashi</i> (that is on the eleventh day after the new moon in the month of Jaistha) that occurs about the middle <a id="Page_119" title="[Pg 119]"></a>of June, the Ghost comes to bathe in the tank at about midnight.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, Jaistha Shukla Ekadashi was only 3 days off, and I decided to prolong my stay at my friend's place, so that I too might have a look at the Ghost's bath.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the eventful day I resolved to pass the night with my friend and two other intrepid souls, near the tank.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After a rather late dinner, we started with a bedding and a Hookah and a pack of cards and a big lamp. We made the bed (a mattress and a sheet) on a platform on the bank. There were six steps, with risers about 9" each, leading from the platform to the water. Thus we were about 4½ feet from the water level; and from this coign of vantage we could command a full view of the tank, which covered an area of about four acres. Then we began our game of cards. There was a servant with us who was preparing our Hookah.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At midnight we felt we could play no longer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The strain was too great; the interest too intense.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We sat smoking and chatting and asked the servant to remove the lamp as a lot of insects was <a id="Page_120" title="[Pg 120]"></a>coming near attracted by the light. As a matter of fact we did not require any light because there was a brilliant moon. At one o'clock in the morning there was a noise as of rushing wind—we looked round and found that not a leaf was moving but still the whizzing noise as of a strong wind continued. Then we found something advancing towards the tank from the opposite bank. There was a number of cocoanut trees on the bank on the other side, and in the moonlight we could not see clearly what it really was. It looked like a huge white elephant. It approached the tank at a rapid pace—say the pace of a fast trotting horse. From the bank it took a long leap and with a tremendous splash fell into the water. The plunge made the water rise on our side and it rose as high as 4½ feet because we got wet through and through.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The mattress and the sheet and all our clothes were wet. In the confusion we forgot to keep our eyes on the Ghost or white elephant or whatever it was and when we again looked in that direction everything was quiet. The apparition had vanished.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The most wonderful thing was the rise in the water level. For the water to rise 4½ feet would <a id="Page_121" title="[Pg 121]"></a>have been impossible under ordinary circumstances even if a thousand elephants had got into the water.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We were all wide awake—We went home immediately because we required a change of clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The old man (my friend's father) was waiting for us. "Well you are wet" he said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes" said we.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Rightly served" said the old man.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He did not ask what had happened. We were told subsequently that he had got wet like us a number of times when he was a youngster himself.</p>

<p class="calibre1">When I was at college there happened what was a most inexplicable incident.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The matter attracted some attention at that time, but has now been forgotten as it was really not so very extraordinary. The police in fact, when called in, explained the matter or at least thought they had done so, to everybody's satisfaction. I was, however, not satisfied with the explanation given by the police. This was what actually happened.</p>
<p class="tbrk">The college was a very big one with a large boarding-house attached to it. The boarding-house was a building separate from the college situated at a distance of about 100 yards from the college building. It was in the form of a quadrangle with a lawn in the centre. The area of this lawn must have been 2,500 square yards. Of course it was surrounded on all sides by buildings, that is, by a row of single rooms on each side.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the boarding-house there was a common room for the amusement of the students. There were all sorts of indoor games including a minia<a id="Page_123" title="[Pg 123]"></a>ture billiard table in this common room. I was a regular visitor there. I did not care for any other indoor game than chess. Of course chess meant keeping out of bed, till late at night.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On this particular occasion, I think it was in November, a certain gentleman, who was an ex-student of the college, was paying us a visit. He was staying with us in the boarding-house. He had himself passed 4 years in that boarding-house and naturally had a love for it. In his time he was very popular with the other boarders and with the Superintendent. Dr. M.N., an English gentleman who was also an inmate of the Boarding-House. With the permission of the learned Doctor, the Superintendent, we decided to make a night of it, and so we all assembled in the common room after dinner. I can picture to myself the cheerful faces of all the students present on that occasion in the well lighted Hall. So far as I know only one of that group is now dead. He was the most jovial and the best beloved of all. May he rest in peace!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now to return from this mournful digression. I could see old Mathura sitting next to me with a Hookah with a very long stem, directing the moves of the chessmen. There was old Birju at <a id="Page_124" title="[Pg 124]"></a>the miniature billiard table poking at everybody with his cue who laughed when he missed an easy shot.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then came in the Superintendent, Dr. M.N. and in a hurry to conceal his Hookah (Indians never smoke in the presence of their elders and superiors) old Mathura nearly upset the table on which the chessmen were; and the mirth went on with redoubled vigour as the Doctor was one of the loudest and merriest of the whole lot on such occasions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus we went on till nearly one in the morning when the Doctor ordered everybody to go to bed. Of course we were glad to retire but we were destined to be soon disturbed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Earlier the same evening we had been playing a friendly Hockey match, and one of the players, let us call him Ram Gholam, had been slightly hurt. As a matter of fact he always got hurt whenever he played.</p>
<p class="calibre1">During the evening the hurt had been forgotten but as soon as he was in bed it was found that he could not sleep. The matter was reported to the Superintendent who finding that there was really nothing the matter with him suggested that the affected parts should be washed with hot water <a id="Page_125" title="[Pg 125]"></a>and finally wrapped in heated castor leaves and bandaged over with flannel. (This is the best medicine for gouty pain—not for hurt caused by a hockey stick).</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a castor tree in the compound and a servant was despatched to bring the leaves. In the meantime a few of us went to the kitchen, made a fire and boiled some water. While thus engaged we heard a noise and a cry for help. We rushed out and ran along the verandah (corridor) to the place whence the cry came. It was coming from the room of Prayag, one of the boarders. We pushed the door but found that it was bolted from inside, we shouted to him to open but he would not. The door had four glass panes on the top and we discovered that the upper bolt only had been used; as a matter of fact the lower bolts had all been removed, because on closing the door from outside, once it had been found that a bolt at the bottom had dropped into its socket and the door had to be broken before it could be opened.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Prayag's room was in darkness. There was a curtain inside and so we could see nothing from outside. We could hear Prayag groaning. The Superintendent came up. To break the glass pane <a id="Page_126" title="[Pg 126]"></a>nearest to the bolt was the work of a minute. The door was opened and we all rushed in. It was a room 14'x12'; many of us could not, therefore, come in. When we went in we took a light with us. It was one of the hurricane lanterns—the one we had taken to the kitchen. The lamp suddenly went out. At the same time a brickbat came rattling down from the roof and fell near my feet, thus I could feel it with my feet and tell what it was. And Prayag groaned again. Dr. M.N. came in, and we helped Prayag out of his bed and took him out on the verandah. Then we saw another brickbat come from the roof of the verandah, and fell in front of Prayag a few inches from his feet. We took him to the central lawn and stood in the middle of it. This time a whole solid brick came from the sky. It fell a few inches from my feet and remained standing on its edge. If it had toppled over it would have fallen on my toes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">By this time all the boarders had come up. Prayag stood in the middle of the group shivering and sweating. A few more brickbats came but not one of us was hurt. Then the trouble ceased. We removed Prayag to the Superintendent's room and put him in the Doctor's bed. There were a reading lamp on a stool near the head of <a id="Page_127" title="[Pg 127]"></a>the bed and a Holy Bible on it. The learned Doctor must have been reading it when he was disturbed. Another bed was brought in and the Doctor passed the night in it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the morning came the police.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They found a goodly heap of brickbats and bones in Prayag's room and on the lawn. There was an investigation, but nothing came out of it. The police however explained the matter as follows:—</p>
<p class="calibre1">There were some people living in the two-storied houses in the neighbourhood. The brickbats and the bones must have come from there. As a matter of fact the police discovered that the Boarding House students and the people who lived in these houses were not on good terms. Those people had organized a music party and the students had objected to it. The matter had been reported to the Magistrate and had ended in a decision in favour of the students. Hence the strained relations. This was the most natural explanation and the only explanation. But this explanation did not satisfy me for several reasons.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The first reason was that the college compound contained another well kept lawn that stood between the Hostel buildings and those two-storied <a id="Page_128" title="[Pg 128]"></a>houses. There were no brickbats on this lawn. If brickbats had been thrown from those houses some at least would have fallen upon the lawn.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then as regarded the brickbats that were in the room, they had all dropped from the ceiling; but in the morning we found the tiles of the roof intact. Thirdly, in the middle of the central lawn there was at least one whole brick. The nearest building from which a brick might have been thrown was at a distance of 100 yards and to throw a whole brick 9"x4½"x3" such a distance would require a machine of some kind or other and none was found in the house.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The last thing that created doubts in my mind was this that not one brickbat had hit anybody. There were so many of us there and there was such an abundance of brickbats still not one of us was hit, and it is well known that brickbats hurled by Ghostly hands do not hit anybody. In fact the whole brick that came and stood on edge within 3 inches of my toe would have hurt me if it had only toppled over.</p>
<p class="tbrk">It is known to most of the readers that Sutteeism was the practice of burning the widows on the funeral pyre of their dead husbands. <a id="Page_129" title="[Pg 129]"></a>This practice was prevalent in Bengal down to the year 1828 when a law forbidding the aiding and abetting of Sutteeism was passed. Before the Act, of course, many women were, in a way, forced to become Suttees. The public opinion against a widow's surviving was so great that she preferred to die rather than live after her husband's death.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The law has, however, changed the custom and the public opinion too.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Still, every now and then there are found cases of determined Sutteeism among all classes in India who profess Hinduism. Frequent instances are found in Bengal; and whenever a case comes to the notice of the public the newspapers report it in a manner which shows that respect for the Suttee is not yet dead.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes a verdict of "Suicide during temporary insanity" is returned, but, of course, whoever reads the report understands how matters stand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I know of a recent case in which a gentleman who was in Government service died leaving a young widow.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="Page_130" title="[Pg 130]"></a>When the husband's dead body was being removed the wife looked so jolly that nobody suspected that anything was wrong with her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But when all the male members of the family had gone away with the bier the young widow quietly procured a tin of Kerosine oil and a few bed sheets. She soaked the bed sheets well in the oil and then wrapped them securely round her person and further secured them by means of a rope. She then shut all the doors of her room and set the clothes on fire. By the time the doors were forced open (there were only ladies in the house at that time) she was dead.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course this was a case of suicide pure and simple and there was the usual verdict of suicide during temporary insanity, but I personally doubt the temporary insanity very much. This case, however, is too painful.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The one that I am now going to relate is more interesting and more mysterious, and probably more instructive.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Babu Bhagwan Prasad, now the late Babu Bhagwan Prasad, was a clerk in the —— office in the United Provinces. He was a grown-up man of 45 when the incident happened.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="Page_131" title="[Pg 131]"></a>He had an attack of cold which subsequently developed into pneumonia and after a lingering illness of 8 days he died at about 8 o'clock one morning.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He had, of course, a wife and a number of children.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Babu Bhagwan Prasad was a well paid officer and maintained a large family consisting of brothers—their wives and their children.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the time of his death, in fact, when the doctor went away in the morning giving his opinion that it was a question of minutes, his wife seemed the least affected of all. While all the members of the family were collected round the bed of their dying relative the lady withdrew to her room saying that she was going to dress for the journey. Of course nobody took any notice of her at the time. She retired to her room and dressed herself in the most elaborate style, and marked her forehead with a large quantity of "Sindur" for the last time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">["Sindur" is red oxide of mercury or lead used by orthodox Hindu women in some parts of India whose husbands are alive; widows do not use it.]</p>
<p class="calibre1">After dressing she came back to the room where her dying husband was and approached the <a id="Page_132" title="[Pg 132]"></a>bed. Those who were there made way for her in surprise. She sat down on the bed and finally lay down by her dying husband's side. This demonstration of sentimentalism could not be tolerated in a family where the Purda is strictly observed and one or two elderly ladies tried to remonstrate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But on touching her they found that she was dead. The husband was dead too. They had both died simultaneously. When the doctor arrived he found the lady dead, but he could not ascertain the cause of her death.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Everybody thought she had taken poison but nothing could be discovered by <i class="calibre10">post mortem</i> examination.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was not a trace of any kind of poison in the body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The funeral of the husband and the wife took place that afternoon and they were cremated on the same pyre.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The stomach and some portions of the intestines of the deceased lady were sent to the chemical examiner and his report (which arrived a week later) did not disclose anything.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The matter remains a mystery.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="Page_133" title="[Pg 133]"></a>It will never be found out what force killed the lady at such a critical moment. Probably it was the strong will of the Suttee that would not allow her body to be separated from that of her husband even in death.</p>
<p class="tbrk">Another very strange incident is reported from a place near Agra in the United Provinces.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There were two respectable residents of the town who were close neighbours. For the convenience of the readers we shall call them Smith and Jones.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Smith and Jones, as has been said already, were close neighbours and the best of friends. Each had his wife and children living with him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now Mr. Smith got fever, on a certain very hot day in June. The fever would not leave him and on the tenth day it was discovered that it was typhoid fever of the worst type.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now typhoid fever is in itself very dangerous, but more so in the case of a person who gets it in June. So poor Smith had no chance of recovery. Of course Jones knew it. Mrs. Smith was a rather uneducated elderly lady and the children were too young. So the medical treatment as well as the <a id="Page_134" title="[Pg 134]"></a>general management of Mr. Smith's affairs was left entirely in the hands of Mr. Jones.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Jones did his best. He procured the best medical advice. He got the best medicines prescribed by the doctors and engaged the best nurse available. But his efforts were of no avail. On a certain Thursday afternoon Smith began to sink fast and at about eight in the evening he died.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Jones on his return from his office that day at about four in the afternoon had been informed that Mr. Smith's condition was very bad, and he had at once gone over to see what he could do.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He had sent for half a dozen doctors, but they on their arrival had found that the case was hopeless. Three of the doctors had accordingly gone away, but the other three had stayed behind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When however Smith was dead, and these three doctors had satisfied themselves that life was quite extinct, they too went away with Mr. Jones leaving the dead body in charge of the mourning members of the family of the deceased.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Jones at once set about making arrangements for the funeral early the next morning; and it was well after eleven at night that he <a id="Page_135" title="[Pg 135]"></a>returned to a very late dinner at his own house. It was a particularly hot night and after smoking his last cigar for the day Mr. Jones went to bed, but not to sleep, after midnight. The death of his old friend and neighbour had made him very sad and thoughtful. The bed had been made on the open roof on the top of the house which was a two storied building and Mr. Jones lay watching the stars and thinking.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At about one in the morning there was a loud knock at the front door. Mr. Jones who was wide awake thought it was one of the servants returning home late and so he did not take any notice of it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After a few moments the knock was repeated at the door which opened on the stairs leading to the roof of the second storey on which Mr. Jones was sleeping. [The visitor had evidently passed through the front door]. This time Mr. Jones knew it was no servant. His first impression was that it was one of the mutual friends who had heard of Smith's death and was coming to make enquiries. So he shouted out "Who is there?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It is I,—Smith" was the reply.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Smith—Smith is dead" stammered Mr. Jones.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="Page_136" title="[Pg 136]"></a>"I want to speak to you, Jones—open the door or I shall come and kill you" said the voice of Smith from beyond the door. A cold sweat stood on Mr. Jones's forehead. It was Smith speaking, there was no doubt of that,—Smith, whom he had seen expire before his very eyes five hours ago. Mr. Jones began to look for a weapon to defend himself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was nothing available except a rather heavy hammer which had been brought up an hour earlier that very night to fix a nail in the wall for hanging a lamp. Mr. Jones took this up and waited for the spirit of Smith at the head of the stairs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The spirit passed through this closed door also. Though the staircase was in total darkness still Mr. Jones could see Smith coming up step by step.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Up and up came Smith and breathlessly Jones waited with the hammer in his hand. Now only three steps divided them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I shall kill you" hissed Smith. Mr. Jones aimed a blow with the hammer and hit Smith between the eyes. With a groan Smith fell down. Mr. Jones fainted.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="Page_137" title="[Pg 137]"></a>A couple of hours later there was a great commotion at the house of Mr. Smith. The dead body had mysteriously disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The first thing they could think of was to go and inform Mr. Jones.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So one of the young sons of Smith came to Mr. Jones's house. The servant admitted him and told him where to find the master.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Young Smith knocked at the door leading to the staircase but got no reply. "After his watchful nights he is sleeping soundly" thought young Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But then Jones must be awakened.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The whole household woke up but not Mr. Jones. One of the servants then procured a ladder and got upon the roof. Mr. Jones was not upon his bed nor under it either. The servant thought he would open the door leading to the staircase and admit the people who were standing outside beyond the door at the bottom of the stairs. There was a number of persons now at the door including Mrs. Jones, her children, servants and young Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The servant stumbled upon something. It was dark but he knew it was the body of his master. He passed on but then he stumbled <a id="Page_138" title="[Pg 138]"></a>again. There was another human being in the way. "Who is this other?—probably a thief" thought the servant.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He opened the door and admitted the people who were outside. They had lights with them. As they came in it was found that the second body on the stairs two or three steps below the landing was the dead body of Smith while the body on the landing was the unconscious form of Mr. Jones.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Restoratives were applied and Jones came to his senses and then related the story that has been recorded above. A doctor was summoned and he found the wound caused by Jones's hammer on Smith's head. There was a deep cut but no blood had come out, therefore, it appeared that the wound must have been caused at least two or three hours after death.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The doctors never investigated whether death could have been caused by the blow given by the hammer. They thought there was no need of an investigation either, because they had left Smith quite dead at eight in the evening.</p>
<p class="calibre1">How Smith's dead body was spirited away and came to Jones's house has been a mystery which will probably never be solved.</p>
<p class="tbrk"><a id="Page_139" title="[Pg 139]"></a>Thinking over the matter recorded above the writer has come to the conclusion that probably a natural explanation might be given of the affair.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking however all the facts of the case as given above to be true (and there is no reason to suppose that they are not) the only explanation that could be given and in fact that was given by some of the sceptical minds of Agra at that time was as follows:—</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Smith was dead. Jones was a very old friend of his. He was rather seriously affected. He must have, in an unconscious state of mind like a somnambulist, carried the dead body of Smith to his own house without being detected in the act. Then his own fevered imagination endowed Smith with the faculty of speech, dead though the latter was; and in a moment of—well—call it temporary insanity, if you please—he inflicted the wound on the forehead of Smith's dead body."</p>
<p class="calibre1">This was the only plausible explanation that could be given of the affair; but regard being had to the fact that Smith's dead body was lying in an upper storey of the house and that there was a number of servants between the death chamber and the main entrance to the house, the act of <a id="Page_140" title="[Pg 140]"></a>removing the dead body without their knowing it was a difficult task, nay utterly impracticable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Over and above this it was not feasible to carry away even at night, the dead body along the road, which is a well frequented thoroughfare, without being observed by anybody.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then there is the third fact that Jones was really not such a strong person that he could carry alone Smith's body that distance with ease.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Smith's dead body as recovered in Jones' house had bare feet; whether there was any dust on the feet, had not been observed by anybody; otherwise some light might have been thrown on this apparently miraculous incident.</p>

<div class="calibre3"></div><h2 id="pgepubid00017" class="calibre4"><a id="WHAT_THE_PROFESSOR_SAW" class="calibre9"></a>WHAT THE PROFESSOR SAW.</h2>
<p class="calibre1">This story is not so painful as the one entitled "<i class="calibre10">What Uncle Saw</i>." How we wish that uncle had seen something else, but all the same how glad we are that uncle did not see what the professor saw. The professor is an M.A. of the University of Calcutta, in Chemistry, and is a Lecturer in a big college. This, of course, I only mention to show that this is not the invention of a foolish person.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I shall now tell the story as I heard it from the professor.</p>
<p class="tbrk">"I was a professor of chemistry in a Calcutta college in the year 18—. One morning I received a letter from home informing me that my eldest brother was ill. It was a case of fever due to cold. Of course, a man does sometimes catch cold and get fever too. There was nothing extraordinary about that.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"In the evening I did not receive any further news. This meant that my brother was better, because in any other case they would have written.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="Page_142" title="[Pg 142]"></a>"A number of friends came to my diggings in the evening and invited me to join their party then going to a theatre. They had reserved some seat but one of the party for whom a seat had been reserved was unavoidably detained and hence a vacant seat. The news of my brother's illness had made me a little sad, the theatre, I thought, would cheer me up. So I joined.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"We left the theatre at about one in the morning. Coming to my house along the now deserted but well-lighted "College Street" of Calcutta I saw from a distance a tall man walking to and fro on the pavement in front of the Senate Hall. When I approached nearer I found that it was my brother of whose illness I had heard in the morning. I was surprised.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"'What are you doing here—brother.' I asked.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"'I came to tell you something.'</p>
<p class="calibre1">"'But you were ill—I heard this morning—by what train did you come?' I asked.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"'I did not come by train—never mind—I went to your "Basa" (lodgings) and found you were out—gone to the theatre, so I waited for you <a id="Page_143" title="[Pg 143]"></a>here as I thought you would prefer walking home instead of taking a hackney carriage—'</p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Very fortunate I did not take one—'</p>
<p class="calibre1">"'In that case I would have seen you at your quarters.'</p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Then come along with me—' I said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"'No' he said 'I shall stay where I am—what I have come to tell you is this, that after I am gone you will take care of the mother and see that she has everything she wants—'</p>
<p class="calibre1">"'But where are you going—' I asked puzzled.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Never mind where I am going—but will you promise—'</p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Promise what—?' I asked.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"'That you will see that the mother has everything she wants.'</p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Certainly—but where on earth are you going—' I asked again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"'I can depend upon your promise then' he said and vanished.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"He vanished mysteriously. In what direction he went I could not say. There was no bye-lane near. It was a very well-lighted part of the <a id="Page_144" title="[Pg 144]"></a>city. He vanished into the thin air. I rubbed my eyes and looked round.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"A policeman was coming along. He was about 50 feet away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I inquired him if he had seen the gentleman who was talking to me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Did you see the other gentleman, officer?' I asked.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Yes' he said looking around 'there were two of you—where is the other—has he robbed you of all you had—these pickpockets have a mysterious way of disappearing—'</p>
<p class="calibre1">"'He was my brother' I said 'and no pickpocket.'</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The policeman looked puzzled too.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I shouted aloud calling my brother by name but received no reply. I took out my gold watch. It was half past one. I walked home at a brisk pace.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"At home I was informed by the servant that my brother had come to look for me an hour ago but on being informed that I was out, had gone away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Whenever he came to Calcutta from the suburbs he put up with a friend of his instead of <a id="Page_145" title="[Pg 145]"></a>with me. So I decided to look him up at his friend's house in the morning. But I was not destined to carry out that plan.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Early the next morning I received a telegram that my brother was dead. The telegram had been sent at 1.20 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> He must have died an hour before. Well—there it was.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I had seen him and so had the policeman. The servant had seen him too. There could be no mistake about that.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I took an early train and reached my suburban home at 10 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> I was informed that my brother had died at midnight. But I had seen him at about half past one and the servant had seen him at about 12.30. I did not tell anybody anything at that time. But I did so afterwards. I was not dreaming—because the conversation we had was a pretty long one. The servant and the police constable could not have been mistaken either. But the mystery remains."</p>
<p class="calibre1">This was the exact story of the professor. Here is something else to the point.</p>
<p class="tbrk">Suicidal Telepathy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A remarkable case of what may be called suicidal telepathy has occurred near Geneva. Mme. Simon, a Swiss widow aged fifty, had been greatly <a id="Page_146" title="[Pg 146]"></a>distressed on account of the removal of her sister, who was five years younger, to a hospital. On Monday afternoon a number of persons who had ascended the Saleve, 4299 feet high, by the funicular railway, were horrified to see a woman walk out on to a ledge overlooking a sheer precipice of three hundred feet, and, after carefully wrapping a shawl round her head and face jump into space. The woman was Mme. Simon, says the <i class="calibre10">Times of India</i>, and she was found on the cliffs below in a mangled condition.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time Mme. Simon's sister, who had not seen or communicated with the former for a week, became hysterical saying her sister was dead and that she did not want to survive her. During the temporary absence of the nurse the woman got out of her bed—opened the window and jumped into the road from the first floor. She is seriously injured and her recovery is doubtful.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The news of the death of Mme. Simon was only known at the hospital nine hours later.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre10">The Leader—Allahabad, 12th February 1913.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Much more wonderful than all this is the story of "The Astral Lady" which appeared in one of <a id="Page_147" title="[Pg 147]"></a>the English Magazines a few months ago. In that case an English medical gentleman saw the <i class="calibre10">Astral Lady</i> in a first class railway compartment in England. Only accidentally he discovered the body of a lady nearly murdered and concealed under one of the seats. His medical help and artificial respiration and stimulants brought her round, and then the doctor saw the original of the Astral Lady in the recovered girl. Well—well—wonderful things do happen sometimes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The phenomenon mentioned in this chapter as <i class="calibre10">the professor's experience</i> is not new. Mr. Justice Norman of the Calcutta High Court saw his mother while sitting in court one day and others saw her too. A few hours later his Lordship received a telegram informing him of her death at the moment when he had seen her in court. This was in broad daylight. Unlike the professor the judge did not even know that his mother was ill.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that immediately after death the dead person appears to some one near and dear to him has been vouched for by others whose veracity and intelligence cannot be questioned.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The appearance of Miss Orme after her death at Mussoorie to Miss Mounce-Stephen in Lucknow <a id="Page_148" title="[Pg 148]"></a>was related in the Allahabad High Court during the trial of the latter lady for the murder of the former. This is on the record of the case. This case created a good deal of interest at the time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Similar to what has been described above is the experience of Lord Brougham.</p>
<p class="calibre1">An extract from his memoirs is as follows:—"A most remarkable thing happened to me. So remarkable that I must tell the story from the beginning. After I left the High School (<i class="calibre10">i.e.</i> Edinburgh) I went with G—— my most intimate friend, to attend the classes of the University.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"There was no divinity class, but we frequently in our walks discussed many grave subjects—among others—<i class="calibre10">the Immortality of the soul and a future state</i>. This question and the possibility of the dead appearing to the living were subjects of much speculation, and we actually committed the folly of drawing up an agreement, written with our blood, to the effect that whichever of us died the first should appear to the other and thus solve the doubts we had entertained of the life after death.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"After we had finished our classes at the college, G—— went to India having got an ap<a id="Page_149" title="[Pg 149]"></a>pointment in the Civil Service there. He seldom wrote to me and after the lapse of a few years, I had nearly forgotten his existence. One day I had taken a warm bath, and, while lying in it enjoying the heat, I turned my head round, looking towards the chair on which I had deposited my clothes, as I was about to get out of the bath. On the chair sat G—looking calmly at me. How I got out of the bath I know not, but on recovering my senses I found myself sprawling on the floor. The apparition or whatever it was that had taken the likeness of G—had disappeared. The vision had produced such a shock that I had no inclination to talk about it or to speak about it even to Stewart, but the impression it made upon me was too vivid to be forgotten easily, and so strongly was I affected by it that I have here written down the whole history with the date, 19th December, and all particulars as they are fresh before me now. No doubt I had fallen asleep and that the appearance presented so distinctly before my eyes was a dream I cannot doubt, yet for years I had no communication with G—nor had there been anything to recall him to my recollection. Nothing had taken place concerning our Swedish travel connected with G—or with India or with anything relating to him or to any member of his <a id="Page_150" title="[Pg 150]"></a>family. I recollected quickly enough our old discussion and the bargain we had made. I could not discharge from my mind the impression that G—— must have died and his appearance to me was to be received by me as a proof of a future state."</p>
<p class="calibre1">This was on the 19th December 1799.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In October 1862 Lord Brougham added a postscript.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I have just been copying out from my journal the account of this strange dream.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"<i class="calibre10">Certissima mortis imago</i>, and now to finish the story begun about 60 years ago. Soon after my return to Edinburgh there arrived a letter from India announcing G's death, and that he died on the 19th December 1799."—<i class="calibre10">The Pall Mall Magazine</i> (1914) pp. 183-184.</p>
<p class="tbrk">Another very fine story and one to the point comes from Hyderabad.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A certain Mr. J—— who was an Englishman, after reading the memoirs of Lord Brougham, was so affected that he related the whole story to his confidential Indian servant. We need not mention here what Mr. J's profession was, all that we need say is that he was not very rich and <a id="Page_151" title="[Pg 151]"></a>in his profession there was no chance of his getting up one morning to find himself a millionaire.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The master and servant executed a bond written with their blood that he who died first would see the other a rich man.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As it happened the native servant died first, and on his death Mr. J—— who was then a young man retired altogether from his business, which business was not in a very flourishing condition. Within a couple of years he went to England a millionaire. How he came by his money remains a secret. People in England were told that he had earned it in India. He must have done so, but the process of his earning he has kept strictly to himself. Mr. J—— is still alive and quite hale.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A different event in which another friend of mine was concerned was thus described the other day. He had received a telegram to the effect that a very near relation of his was dying in Calcutta and that this dying person was desirous to see him. He started for Calcutta in all haste by the mail. The mail used to leave his station at about 3 P.M. in the afternoon and reach Calcutta early the next morning. It was hot weather and in his first class compartment there was no other passenger. He lay down on one of <a id="Page_152" title="[Pg 152]"></a>the sleeping berths and the other one was empty. All the lamps including the night light had been switched off and the compartment was in total darkness, but for the moonlight. The moon beams too did not come into the compartment itself as the moon was nearly overhead.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He had fallen into a disturbed sleep when on waking up he found there was another occupant of the compartment. As thefts had been a common incident on the line specially in first class compartments, my friend switched on the electric light, the button of which was within his reach. This could be done without getting up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the glare of the electric light he saw distinctly his dying relation. He thought he was dreaming. He rubbed his eyes and then looked again. The apparition had vanished. He got up and looked out of the window. The train was passing through a station, without stopping. He could read the name of the station clearly. He opened his time table to see that he was still 148 miles from Calcutta.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he went to sleep again. In the morning he thought he had been dreaming. But he observed that the railway time table was still open at <a id="Page_153" title="[Pg 153]"></a>the place where he must have looked to ascertain the distance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On reaching Calcutta he was told that his relation had died a few hours ago.</p>
<p class="calibre1">My friend never related this to anybody till he knew that I was writing on the subject. This story, however, after what the professor saw loses its interest; and some suggested that it had better not be written at all. I only write this because this friend of mine—who is also a relation of mine—is a big Government servant and would not have told this story unless it was true.</p>
<p class="tbrk">To the point is the following story which was in the papers about March 1914.</p>
<blockquote class="calibre11"><div class="index">
<p class="calibre1">'In 1821 the Argyle Rooms were patronised by the best people, the establishment being then noted for high-class musical entertainments. One evening in March, 1821, a young Miss M. with a party of friends, was at a concert in Argyle Rooms. Suddenly she uttered a cry and hid her face in her hands. She appeared to be suffering so acutely that her friends at once left the building with her and took her home. It was at first difficult to get the young lady to explain the cause of her sudden attack, but at last she confessed that she had been terrified by a horrible sight. While the concert was in progress she had happened to look down at the floor, and there lying at her feet she saw the corpse of a man. The body was covered with a cloth mantle, but the face was exposed, and she distinctly recognised the features of a friend, Sir J.T. On the following morning the family of the <a id="Page_154" title="[Pg 154]"></a>young lady received a message informing them that Sir J.T. had been drowned the previous day in Southampton Water through the capsizing of a boat, and that when his body was recovered it was entangled in a boat cloak. The story of the Argyle Rooms apparition is told by Mr. Thomas Raikes in his well-known diary, and he personally vouches for the truth of it.'</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p class="tbrk">In this connection the following cutting from an English paper of March, 1914, will be found very interesting and instructive.</p>
<p class="center">'TALKS' WITH <span class="smcap">Mr.</span> STEAD.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sir A. Turner's Psychic Experiences</span>.</p>
<blockquote class="calibre11"><div class="index">
<p class="calibre1">General Sir Alfred Turner's psychic experiences, which he related to the London Spiritualist Alliance on May 7, in the salon of the Royal Society of British Artists, cover a very wide field, and they date from his early boyhood.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The most interesting and suggestive relate to the re-appearance of Mr. Stead, says the <i class="calibre10">Daily Chronicle</i>. On the Sunday following the sinking of the Titanic, Sir Alfred was visiting a medium when she told him that on the glass of the picture behind his back the head of a man and afterwards 'its' whole form appeared. She described him minutely, and said he was holding a child by the hand. He had no doubt that it was Mr. Stead, and he wrote immediately to Miss Harper, Mr. Stead's private secretary. She replied saying that on the same day she had seen a similar apparition, in which Mr. Stead was holding a child by the hand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A few days afterwards (continued Sir Alfred) at a private seance the voice of Stead came almost immediately and spoke at length. He told them what had happened in the last minutes of the wreck. All those who were on board when the <a id="Page_155" title="[Pg 155]"></a>vessel sank soon passed over, but they had not the slightest notion that they were dead. Stead knew however, and he set to work to try and tell these poor people that they had passed over and that there was at any rate no more physical suffering for them. Shortly afterwards he was joined by other spirits, who took part in the missionary work.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Stead was asked to show himself to the circle. He said 'Not now, but at Cambridge House.' At the meeting which took place there, not everybody was sympathetic, and the results were poor, except that Mr. Stead came to them in short sharp flashes dressed exactly as he was when on earth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Since then, said Sir Alfred, he had seen and conversed with Mr. Stead many times. When he had shown himself he had said very little, when he did not appear he said a great deal. On the occasion of his last appearance he said: 'I cannot speak to you. But pursue the truth. It is all truth.'</p>
<p class="calibre1">I am confident, Sir Alfred declared, that Mr. Stead will be of the greatest help to those of us who, on earth, work with him and to others who believe.</p>
