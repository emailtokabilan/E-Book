<p class="calibre1">This story need not have been written. It is too sad and too mysterious, but since reference has been made to it in this book, it is only right that readers should know this sad account.</p>
<p class="tbrk">Uncle was a very strong and powerful man and used to boast a good deal of his strength. He was employed in a Government Office in Calcutta. He used to come to his village home during the holidays. He was a widower with one or two children, who stayed with his brother's family in the village.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Uncle has had no bed-room of his own since his wife's death. Whenever he paid us a visit one of us used to place his bed-room at uncle's disposal. It is a custom in Bengal to sleep with one's wife and children in the same bed-room. So whenever Uncle turned up I used to give my bed-room to him as I was the only person without children. On such occasions I slept in one of the "Baithaks" (drawing-rooms). A Baithak is a drawing-room and guest-room combined.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In rich Bengal families of the orthodox style the "Baithak" or "Baithak khana" is a very large <a id="Page_45" title="[Pg 45]"></a>room generally devoid of all furniture, having a thick rich carpet on the floor with a clean sheet upon it and big <i class="calibre10">takias</i> (pillows) all around the wall. The elderly people would sit on the ground and lean against the <i class="calibre10">takias</i>; while we, the younger lot, sat upon the takias and leaned against the wall which in the case of the particular room in our house was covered with some kind of yellow paint which did not come off on the clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes a <i class="calibre10">takia</i> would burst and the cotton stuffing inside would come out; and then the old servant (his status is that of an English butler, his duty to prepare the hookah for the master) would give us a chase with a <i class="calibre10">lathi</i> (stick) and the offender would run away, and not return until all incriminating evidence had been removed and the old servant's wrath had subsided.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, when Uncle used to come I slept in the "Baithak" and my wife slept somewhere in the zenana, I never inquired where.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On this particular occasion Uncle missed the train by which he usually came. It was the month of October and he should have arrived at 8 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> My bed had been made in the Baithak. But the 8 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> train came and stopped and passed on and Uncle did not turn up.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="Page_46" title="[Pg 46]"></a>So we thought he had been detained for the night. It was the Durgapooja season and some presents for the children at home had to be purchased and, we thought, that was what was detaining him. And so at about 10 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> we all retired to bed. The bed that had been made for me in the "Baithak" remained there for Uncle in case he turned up by the 11 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> train. As a matter of fact we did not expect him till the next morning.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But as misfortune would have it Uncle did arrive by the 11 o'clock train.</p>
<p class="calibre1">All the house-hold had retired, and though the old servant suggested that I should be waked up, Uncle would not hear of it. He would sleep in the bed originally made for me, he said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The bed was in the central Baithak or hall. My Uncle was very fond of sleeping in side-rooms. I do not know why. Anyhow he ordered the servant to remove his bed to one of the side-rooms. Accordingly the bed was taken to one of them. One side of that room had two windows opening on the garden. The garden was more a park-like place, rather neglected, but still well wooded abounding in jack fruit trees. It used to be quite shady and dark during the day there. On <a id="Page_47" title="[Pg 47]"></a>this particular night it must have been very dark. I do not remember now whether there was a moon or not.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, Uncle went to sleep and so did the servants. It was about 8 o'clock the next morning, when we thought that Uncle had slept long enough, that we went to wake him up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The door connecting the side-room with the main Baithak was closed, but not bolted from inside; so we pushed the door open and went in.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Uncle lay in bed panting. He stared at us with eyes that saw but did not perceive. We at once knew that something was wrong. On touching his body we found that he had high fever. We opened the windows, and it was then that Uncle spoke "Don't open or it would come in—"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What would come in Uncle—what?" we asked.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But uncle had fainted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The doctor was called in. He arrived at about ten in the morning. He said it was high fever—due to what he could not say. All the same he prescribed a medicine.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="Page_48" title="[Pg 48]"></a>The medicine had the effect of reducing the temperature, and at about 6 in the evening consciousness returned. Still he was in a very weak condition. Some medicine was given to induce sleep and he passed the night well. We nursed him by turns at night. The next morning we had all the satisfaction of seeing him all right. He walked from the bed-room, though still very weak and came to the Central Baithak where he had tea with us. It was then that we asked what he had seen and what he had meant by "It would come in."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh how we wish, we had never asked him the question, at least then.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This was what he said:—</p>
<p class="calibre1">"After I had gone to bed I found that there were a few mosquitoes and so I could not sleep well. It was about midnight when they gradually disappeared and then I began to fall asleep. But just as I was dozing off I heard somebody strike the bars of the windows thrice. It was like three distinct strokes with a cane on the gratings outside. 'Who is there?' I asked; but no reply. The striking stopped. Again I closed my eyes and again the same strokes were repeated. This time I nearly lost my temper; I thought it was some <a id="Page_49" title="[Pg 49]"></a>urchin of the neighbourhood in a mischievous mood. 'Who is there?' I again shouted—again no reply. The striking however stopped. But after a time it commenced afresh. This time I lost my temper completely and opened the window, determined to thrash anybody whom I found there—forgetting that the windows were barred and fully 6 feet above the ground. Well in the darkness I saw, I saw—."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Here uncle had a fit of shivering and panting, and within a minute he lost all consciousness. The fever was again high. The doctor was summoned but this time his medicines did no good. Uncle never regained consciousness. In fact after 24 hours he died of heart failure the next morning, leaving his story unfinished and without in any way giving us an idea of what that terrible thing was which he had seen beyond the window. The whole thing remains a deep mystery and unfortunately the mystery will never be solved.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nobody has ventured to pass a night in the side-room since then. If I had not been a married man with a very young wife I might have tried.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One thing however remains and it is this that though uncle got all the fright in the world in <a id="Page_50" title="[Pg 50]"></a>that room, he neither came out of that room nor called for help.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One cry for help and the whole house-hold would have been awake. In fact there was a servant within 30 yards of the window which uncle had opened; and this man says he heard uncle open the window and close and bolt it again, though he had not heard uncle's shouts of "Who is there?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Only this morning I read this funny advertisement in the Morning Post.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"<i class="calibre10">Haunted Houses.</i>—Man and wife, cultured and travelled, gentle people—having lost fortune ready to act as care-takers and to investigate in view of removing trouble—."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well—in a haunted house these gentle people expect to see something. Let us hope they will not see what our Uncle saw or what the Major saw.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This advertisement clearly shows that even in countries like England haunted houses do exist, or at least houses exist which are believed to be haunted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If what we see really depends on what we think or what we believe, no wonder that there are <a id="Page_51" title="[Pg 51]"></a>so many more haunted houses in India than in England. This reminds me of a very old incident of my early school days. A boy was really caught by a Ghost and then there was trouble. We shall not forget the thrashing we received from our teacher in the school; and the fellow who was actually caught by the Ghost—if Ghost it was, will never say in future that Ghosts don't exist.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In this connection it may not be out of place to narrate another incident, though it does not fall within the same category with the main story that heads this chapter. The only reason why I do so is that the facts tally in one respect, though in one respect only, and that is that the person who knew would tell nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This was a friend of mine who was a widower. We were in the same office together and he occupied a chair and a table next but one to mine. This gentleman was in our office for only six months after narrating the story. If he had stayed longer we might have got out his secret, but unfortunately he went away; he has gone so far from us that probably we shall not meet again for the next 10 years.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was in connection with the "Smith's dead wife's photograph" controversy that one day one <a id="Page_52" title="[Pg 52]"></a>of my fellow clerks told me that a visit from a dead wife was nothing very wonderful, as our friend Haralal could testify.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I always took of a lot of interest in ghosts and their stories. So I was generally at Haralal's desk cross-examining him about this affair; at first the gentleman was very uncommunicative but when he saw I would give him no rest he made a statement which I have every reason to believe is true. This is more or less what he says.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It was about ten years ago that I joined this office. I have been a widower ever since I left college—in fact I married the daughter of a neighbour when I was at college and she died about 3 years afterwards, when I was just thinking of beginning life in right earnest. She has been dead these 10 years and I shall never marry again, (a young widower in good circumstances, in Bengal, is as rare as a blue rose).</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I have a suite of bachelor rooms in Calcutta, but I go to my suburban home on every Saturday afternoon and stay there till Monday morning, that is, I pass my Saturday night and the whole of Sunday in my village home every week.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"On this particular occasion nearly eight years ago, that is, about a year and a half after the <a id="Page_53" title="[Pg 53]"></a>death of my young wife I went home by an evening train. There is any number of trains in the evening and there is no certainty by which train I go, so if I am late, generally everybody goes to bed with the exception of my mother.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"On this particular night I reached home rather late. It was the month of September and there had been a heavy shower in the town and all tram-car services had been suspended.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"When I reached the Railway Station I found that the trains were not running to time either. I was given to understand that a tree had been blown down against the telegraph wire, and so the signals were not going through; and as it was rather dark the trains were only running on the report of <i class="calibre10">a motor trolly</i> that the line was clear. Thus I reached home at about eleven instead of eight in the evening.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I found my father also sitting up for me though he had had his dinner. He wanted to learn the particulars of the storm at Calcutta.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Within ten minutes of my arrival he went to bed and within an hour I finished my dinner and retired for the night.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"<a id="Page_54" title="[Pg 54]"></a>It was rather stuffy and the bed was damp as I was perspiring freely; and consequently I was not feeling inclined to sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"A little after midnight I felt that there was somebody else in the room.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I looked at the closed door—yes there was no mistake about it, it was my wife, my wife who had been dead these eighteen months.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"At first I was—well you can guess my feeling—then she spoke:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"'There is a cool bed-mat under the bedstead; it is rather dusty, but it will make you comfortable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I got up and looked under the bedstead—yes the cool bed-mat was there right enough and it was dusty too. I took it outside and I cleaned it by giving it a few jerks. Yes, I had to pass through the door at which she was standing within six inches of her,—don't put any questions; Let me tell you as much as I like; you will get nothing out of me if you interrupt—yes, I passed a comfortable night. She was in that room for a long time, telling me lots of things. The next morning my mother enquired with whom I was talking and I told her a lie. I said I was reading <a id="Page_55" title="[Pg 55]"></a>my novel aloud. They all know it at home now. She comes and passes two nights with me in the week when I am at home. She does not come to Calcutta. She talks about various matters and she is happy—don't ask me how I know that. I shall not tell you whether I have touched her body because that will give rise to further questions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Everybody at home has seen her, and they all know what I have told you, but nobody has spoken to her. They all respect and love her—nobody is afraid. In fact she never comes except on Saturday and Sunday evenings and that when I am at home."</p>
<p class="calibre1">No amount of cross-examination, coaxing or inducement made my friend Haralal say anything further.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This story in itself would not probably have been believed; but after the incident of "His dead wife's picture" nobody disbelieved it, and there is no reason why anybody should. Haralal is not a man who would tell yarns, and then I have made enquiries at Haralal's village where several persons know this much; that his dead wife pays him a visit twice every week.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="Page_56" title="[Pg 56]"></a>Now that Haralal is 500 miles from his village home I do not know how things stand; but I am told that this story reached the ears of the <i class="calibre10">Bara Saheb</i> and he asked Haralal if he would object to a transfer and Haralal told him that he would not.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I shall leave the reader to draw his own conclusions.</p>

<div class="calibre3"></div><h2 id="pgepubid00012" class="calibre4"><a id="THE_BOY_WHO_WAS_CAUGHT" class="calibre9"></a>THE BOY WHO WAS CAUGHT.</h2>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing is more common in India than seeing a ghost. Every one of us has seen ghost at some period of his existence; and if we have not actually seen one, some other person has, and has given us such a vivid description that we cannot but believe to be true what we hear.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is, however, my own experience. I am told others have observed the phenomenon before.</p>
<p class="tbrk">When we were boys at school we used, among other things, to discuss ghosts. Most of my fellow students asserted that they did not believe in ghosts, but I was one of those who not only believed in their existence but also in their power to do harm to human beings if they liked. Of course, I was in the minority. As a matter of fact I knew that all those who said that they did not believe in ghosts told a lie. They believed in ghosts as much as I did, only they had not the courage to admit their weakness and differ boldly from the sceptics. Among the lot of unbelievers was one Ram Lal, a student of the Fifth Standard, who swore that he did not believe in ghosts and <a id="Page_58" title="[Pg 58]"></a>further that he would do anything to convince us that they did not exist.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was, therefore, at my suggestion that he decided to go one moon-light night and hammer down a wooden peg into the soft sandy soil of the Hindoo Burning Ghat, it being well known that the ghosts generally put in a visible appearance at a burning ghat on a moon-light night. (A burning ghat is the place where dead bodies of Hindoos are cremated).</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the warm month of April and the river had shrunk into the size of a nullah or drain. The real pukka ghat (the bathing place, built of bricks and lime) was about 200 yards from the water of the main stream, with a stretch of sand between.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The ghats are only used in the morning when people come to bathe, and in the evening they are all deserted. After a game of football on the school grounds we sometimes used to come and sit on the pukka ghat for an hour and return home after nightfall.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, it was the 23rd of April and a bright moon-light night, every one of us (there were about a dozen) had told the people at home that there was a function at the school and he might <a id="Page_59" title="[Pg 59]"></a>be late. On this night, it was arranged that the ghost test should take place.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The boy who had challenged the ghost, Ram Lal, was to join us at the pukka ghat at 8 P.M.; and then while we waited there he would walk across the sand and drive the peg into the ground at the place where a dead body had been cremated that very morning. We were to supply the peg and the hammer. (I had to pay the school gardener two annas for the loan of a peg and a hammer).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, we procured the peg and the hammer and proceeded to the pukka ghat. If the gardener had known what we required the peg and the hammer for, I am sure he would not have lent these to us.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Though I was a firm believer in ghosts yet I did not expect that Ram Lal would be caught. What I hoped for was that he would not turn up at the trysting place. But to my disappointment Ram Lal did turn up and at the appointed hour too. He came boasting as usual, took the peg and the hammer and started across the sand saying that he would break the head of any ghost who might venture within the reach of the hammerhead. Well, he went along and we waited <a id="Page_60" title="[Pg 60]"></a>for his return at the pukka ghat. It was a glorious night, the whole expanse of sand was shining in the bright moon-light.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On and on went Ram Lal with the peg in his left hand and the hammer in his right. He was dressed in the usual upcountry Indian style, in a long coat or Achkan which reached well below his knees and fluttered in the breeze.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As he went on his pace slackened. When he had gone about half the distance he stopped and looked back. We hoped he would return. He put down the hammer and the peg, sat down on the sand facing us, took off his shoes. Only some sand had got in. He took up the peg and hammer and walked on.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But then we felt that his courage was oozing away. Another fifty yards and he again stopped, and looked back at us.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another fifty yards remained. Will he return? No! he again proceeded, but we could clearly see that his steps were less jaunty than when he had started. We knew that he was trembling, we knew that he would have blessed us to call him back. But we would not yield, neither would he. Looking in our direction at every step he <a id="Page_61" title="[Pg 61]"></a>proceeded and reached the burning ghat. He reached the identical spot where the pyre had been erected in the morning.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was very little breeze,—not a mouse stirring. Not a soul was within 200 yards of him and he could not expect much help from us. How poor Ram Lal's heart must have palpitated! When we see Ram Lal now how we feel that we should burst.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, Ram Lal knelt down, fixed the peg in the wet sandy soil and began hammering. After each stroke he looked at us and at the river and in all directions. He struck blow after blow and we counted about thirty. That his hands had become nerveless we would understand, for otherwise a dozen strokes should have been enough to make the peg vanish in the soft sandy soil.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The peg went in and only about a couple of inches remained visible above the surface; and then Ram Lal thought of coming back. He was kneeling still. He tried to stand up, gave out a shrill cry for help and fell down face foremost.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It must have been his cry for help that made us forget our fear of the ghost, and we all ran at <a id="Page_62" title="[Pg 62]"></a>top speed towards the ghat. It was rather difficult to run fast on the sand but we managed it as well as we could, and stopped only when we were about half a dozen yards from the unconscious form of Ram Lal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There he lay senseless as if gone to sleep. Our instinct told us that he was not dead. We thanked God, and each one of us sent up a silent prayer. Then we cried for help and a boatman who lived a quarter of a mile away came up. He took up Ram Lal in his arms and as he was doing it <i class="calibre10">tr</i>—<i class="calibre10">rrrrrrrrrr</i>— went Ram Lal's long coat. The unfortunate lad had hammered the skirt of his long coat along with the peg into the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We took Ram Lal to his house and explained to his mother that he had a bad fall in the football field, and there we left him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next morning at school, one student, who was a neighbour of Ram Lal, told us that the whole mischief had become known.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ram Lal, it appears, got high fever immediately after we had left him and about midnight he became delirious and in that condition he disclosed everything in connection with his adventure at the ghat.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="Page_63" title="[Pg 63]"></a>In the evening we went to see him. His parents were very angry with us.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The whole story reached the ears of the school authorities and we got, what I thought I richly deserved (for having allowed any mortal being to defy a ghost) but what I need not say.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ram Lal is now a grown up young man. He holds a responsible government appointment and I meet him sometimes when he comes to tour in our part of the Province.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I always ask him if he has seen a ghost since we met last.</p>
<p class="tbrk">In this connection it will not be out of place to mention two simple stories one from my own experience and another told by a friend.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I shall tell my friend's story first, in his own words.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I used to go for a bath in the Ganges early every morning. I used to start from home at 4 o'clock in the morning and walked down to the Ganges which was about 3 miles from my house. The bath took about an hour and then I used to come back in my carriage which went for me at about six in the morning.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="Page_64" title="[Pg 64]"></a>"On this eventful morning when I awoke it was brilliant moonlight and so I thought it was dawn.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I started from home without looking at the clock and when I was about a mile and a half from home and about the same distance from the river I realized that I was rather early. The policeman under the railway bridge told me that it was only 2 o'clock. I knew that I should have to cross the small <i class="calibre10">maidan</i> through which the road ran and I remembered that there was a rumour that a ghost had sometimes been seen in the <i class="calibre10">maidan</i> and on the road. This however did not make me nervous, because I really did not believe in ghosts; but all the same I wished I could have gone back. But then in going back I should have to pass the policeman and he would think that I was afraid; so I decided to go on.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"When I entered the <i class="calibre10">maidan</i> a creepy sensation came over me. My first idea was that I was being followed, but I did not dare look back, all the same I went on with quick steps.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"My next idea was that a gust of wind swept past me, and then I thought that a huge form was passing over the trees which lined the road.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="Page_65" title="[Pg 65]"></a>"By this time I was in the middle of the <i class="calibre10">maidan</i> about half a mile from the nearest human being.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"And then, horror of horrors, the huge form came down from the trees and stood in the middle of the road about a hundred yards ahead of me, barring my way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I instinctively moved to the side—but did not stop. By the time I reached the spot, I had left the metalled portion of the road and was actually passing under the road-side trees allowing their thick trunks to intervene between me and the huge form standing in the middle of the road. I did not look at it, but I was sure it was extending a gigantic arm towards me. It could not, however, catch me and I walked on with vigorous strides. After I had passed the figure I nearly ran under the trees, my heart beating like a sledge hammer within me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"After a couple of minutes I saw two glaring eyes in front of me. This I thought was the end. The eyes were advancing towards me at a rapid pace and then I heard a shout like that of a cow in distress. I stopped where I was. I hoped the ghost would pass along the road overlooking me. But when the ghost was within say fifty yards of <a id="Page_66" title="[Pg 66]"></a>me it gave another howl and I knew that it had seen me. A cry for help escaped my lips and I fainted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"When I regained consciousness I found myself on the grassy foot-path by the side of the road, about 4 or 5 human beings hovering about me and a motor car standing near.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then the whole mystery became clear as day-light. The eyes that I had seen were the headlights of the 24 H.P. Silent Knight Minerva of Captain ——. He had gone on a pleasure-trip to the next station and was returning home with two friends and his wife in his motor car when in that part of the road he saw something like a man standing in the middle of the road and sounded his horn. As the figure in the middle of the road would not move aside he slowed down and then heard my cry.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The rest the reader may guess. The figure that had loomed so large with out-stretched arm was only a municipal danger signal erected in the middle of the road. A red lamp had been placed on the top of the erection but it had been blown out."</p>
<p class="calibre1">This was the whole story of my friend. It shows how even our prosaic but overwrought <a id="Page_67" title="[Pg 67]"></a>imagination sometimes gives to airy nothings a local habitation and a name. My own personal experience which I shall describe now will also, I am sure, be interesting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was on a brilliant moon-light night in the month of June that we were sleeping in the open court-yard of our house.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, the court-yard had a wall all round with a partition in the middle; on one side of the partition slept three girls of the family and on the other were the younger male members, four in number.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was our custom to have a long chat after dinner and before retiring to bed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On this particular night the talk had been about ghosts. Of course, the girls are always ready to believe everything and so when we left them we knew that they would not sleep very comfortably that night. We retired to our part of the court-yard, but we could overhear the conversation of the girls. One was trying to convince the other two that ghosts did not exist and if they did exist they never came into contact with human beings.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then we fell asleep.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="Page_68" title="[Pg 68]"></a>How long we had slept we did not know, but a sudden cry from, one of the girls awoke us and within three seconds we were across the low partition wall, and with her. She was sitting up in bed pointing with her fingers. Following the direction we saw in the clear moonlight the figure of a short woman standing in the corner of the court-yard about 20 yards from us pointing her finger at something (not towards us).</p>
<p class="calibre1">We looked in that direction bub could see nothing peculiar there.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Our first idea was that it was one of the maid-servants, who had heard our after-dinner conversation, playing the ghost. But this particular ghostly lady was very short, much shorter than any servant in the establishment. After some, hesitation all (four) of us advanced towards the ghost. I remember how my heart throbbed as I advanced with the other three boys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then we laughed loud and long.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What do you think it was?</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was only the Lawn Tennis net wrapped round the pole standing against the wall. The handle of the ratchet arrangement looked like an extending finger.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="Page_69" title="[Pg 69]"></a>But from a distance in the moon-light it looked exactly like a short woman draped in white.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This story again shows what trick our imagination plays with us at times.</p>
<p class="tbrk">Talking of ghosts reminds me of a very funny story told by a friend of my grand-father—a famous medical man of Calcutta.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This famous doctor was once sent for to treat a gentleman at Agra. This gentleman was a rich Marwari who was suffering from indigestion. When the doctor reached Agra he was lodged in very comfortable quarters and a number of horses and carriages was placed at his disposal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He was informed that the patient had been treated by all the local and provincial practitioners but without any result.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The doctor who was as clever a man of the world as of medicine, at once saw that there was really nothing the matter with the patient. He was really suffering from a curious malady which could in a phrase be called—"want of physical exercise."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Agra, the city after which the Province is named, abounds in old magnificent buildings <a id="Page_70" title="[Pg 70]"></a>which it takes the tourist a considerable time to see, and the Doctor, of course, was enjoying all the sights in the meantime.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He also prescribed a number of medicines which proved of no avail. The Doctor had anticipated it, and so he had decided what medicine he would prescribe next.</p>
<p class="calibre1">During the sight-seeing excursions into the environs of the city the doctor had discovered a large pukka well not far from a main street and at a distance of 3 miles from his patient's house.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This was a very old disused well and it was generally rumoured that a ghost dwelt in it. So nobody would go near the well at night. Of course, there was a lot of stories as to what the ghost looked like and how he came out at times and stood on the brink and all that,—but the doctor really did not believe any of these. He, however, believed that this ghost, (whether there really was any or not in that well) would cure his patient.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So one morning when he saw his patient he said "Lalla Saheb—I have found out the real cause of your trouble—it is a ghost whom you have got to propitiate and unless you do that you <a id="Page_71" title="[Pg 71]"></a>will never get well—and no medicine will help you and your digestion will never improve."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"A Ghost?" asked the patient.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"A Ghost!" exclaimed the people around.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"A Ghost" said the doctor sagely.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What shall I have to do?" inquired the patient, anxiously—</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You will have to go every morning to that well (indicating the one mentioned above), and throw a basketful of flowers in" said the doctor.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I shall do that every day" said the patient.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then we shall begin from to-morrow" said the doctor.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next morning everybody had been ready to start long before the doctor was out of bed. He came at last and all got up to start. Then a big landau and pair drew up to take the doctor and the patient to the abode of the ghost in the well. Just as the patient was thinking of getting in the doctor said "We don't require a carriage Lalla Saheb—we shall all have to walk—and bare-footed too, and between you and me we shall have to carry the basket of flowers also."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The patient was really troubled. Never indeed in his life had he walked a mile—not to say of <a id="Page_72" title="[Pg 72]"></a>three—and that, bare-footed and carrying a basket of flowers in his hands. However he had to do it. It was a goodly procession. The big millionaire—the big doctor with a large number of followers walking bare-footed—caused amazement and amusement to all who saw them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It took them a full hour and a half to reach the well—and there the doctor pronounced the <i class="calibre10">mantra</i> in Sanskrit and the flowers were thrown in. The <i class="calibre10">mantra</i> (charm) was in Sanskrit, the doctor who knew a little of the language had taken great pains to compose it the night before and even then it was not grammatically quite correct.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At last the party returned, but not on foot. The journey back was performed in the carriages that had followed the patient and his doctor. From that day the practice was followed regularly. The patient's health began to improve and he began to regain his power of digestion fast. In a month he was all right; but he never discontinued the practice of going to the well and throwing in a basketful of flowers with his own hands. He had also learnt the <i class="calibre10">mantra</i> (the mystic charm) by heart; but the doctor had sworn him to secrecy and he told it to nobody. Shoes with felt sole <a id="Page_73" title="[Pg 73]"></a>were soon procured from England (it being 40 years before any Indian Rope Sole Shoe Factory came into existence) and thus the inconvenience of walking this distance bare-footed was easily obviated.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After a month's further stay the doctor came away from Agra having earned a fabulous fee, and he always received occasional letters and presents from his patient who never discontinued the practice of visiting the well till his death about 17 years later.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The three-mile walk is all that he requires" said the doctor to his friends (among whom evidently my grand-father was one) on his return from Agra, "and since he has got used to it now he won't discontinue even if he comes to know of the deception I have practised on him—and I have cured his indigestion after all."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The patient, of course, never discovered the fraud. He never gave the matter his serious consideration. His friends, who were as ignorant and prejudiced as he himself was, believed in the <i class="calibre10">ghost</i> as much as he did himself. The medical practitioners of Agra who probably were in the Doctor's secret never told him anything—and if they had told him anything they would probably <a id="Page_74" title="[Pg 74]"></a>have heard language from <i class="calibre10">Our patient</i> that could not well be described as quite parliamentary, for they had all tried to cure him and failed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This series of stories will prove how much "imagination" works upon the external organs of a human being.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If a person goes about with the idea that there is a ghost somewhere about he will probably see the ghost in everything.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But has it ever struck the reader that sometimes horses and dogs do not quite enjoy going to a place which is reputed to be haunted?</p>
<p class="calibre1">In a village in Bengal not far from my home there is a big Jack-fruit tree which is said to be haunted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I visited this place once—the local zamindar had sent me his elephant. The Gomashta (estate manager) who knew that I had come to see the haunted tree, told me that I should probably see nothing during the day, but the elephant would not go near the tree.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I passed the tree. It was about 3 miles from the Railway Station. There was nothing extraordinary about it. This was about 11 o'clock in the morning. Then I went to the Shooting Box (usually called the Cutchery or Court <a id="Page_75" title="[Pg 75]"></a>house—where the zamindars and their servants put up when they pay a visit to this part of their possessions) to have my bath and breakfast most hospitably provided by my generous host. I ordered the elephant to be put under this tree, and this was done though the people there told me that the elephant would not remain there long.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At about 2 P.M. I heard an extraordinary noise from the tree.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was only the elephant. It was wailing and was looking as bad as it possibly could.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We all went there but found nothing. The elephant was not ill.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I ordered it to be taken away from under the tree. As soon as the chain was removed from the animal's foot it rushed away like a race horse and would not stop within 200 yards of the tree. I was vastly amused. I had never seen an elephant running before. But under the tree we found nothing. What made the elephant so afraid has remained a secret.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The servants told me (what I had heard before) that it was only elephants, horses and dogs that did not stay long under that tree. No human eyes have ever seen anything supernatural or fearful there.</p>

<div class="calibre3"></div><h2 id="pgepubid00013" class="calibre4"><a id="THE_STARVING_MILLIONAIRE" class="calibre9"></a>THE STARVING MILLIONAIRE.</h2>
<p class="calibre1">This story was also in the papers. It created a sensation at the time, now it has been almost forgotten. The story shows that black art with all its mysteries is not a thing of the past.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This was what happened.</p>
<p class="tbrk">There was a certain rich European Contractor in the Central Provinces in India.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Let us call him Anderson. He used to supply stone ballast to the Railway Companies and had been doing this business for over a quarter of a century. He had accumulated wealth and was a multi-millionaire and one of the richest men in his part of the country. The district which he made his head quarters was a large one. It was a second class military station and there were two European regiments and one Indian regiment in that station. Necessarily there was a number of European military officers besides a number of civil and executive officers in that station.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On a certain June morning, which is a very hot month in India, an Indian Fakir came into the compound of Mr. Anderson begging for alms. Mr. Anderson and his wife were sitting in the <a id="Page_77" title="[Pg 77]"></a>verandah drinking their morning tea. It had been a very hot night and there being no electricity in this particular station, Mr. Anderson had to depend on the sleepy punkha coolie. The punkha coolie on this particular night was more sleepy than usual, and so Mr. Anderson had passed a very sleepless night indeed. He was in a very bad temper. A whole life passed among Indian workmen does not generally make a man good-tempered and a hot June in the Indian plains is not particularly conducive to sweet temper either. When this beggar came in Mr. Anderson was in a very bad mood. As the man walked fearlessly up to the verandah Mr. Anderson's temper became worse. He asked the beggar what he wanted. The beggar answered he wanted food. Of course, Mr. Anderson said he had nothing to give. The beggar replied that he would accept some money and buy the food. Mr. Anderson was not in the habit of being contradicted. He lost his temper—abused the beggar and ordered his servants to turn the man out. The servants obeyed. Before his departure the beggar turned to Mr. Anderson and told him that very soon he would know how painful it was to be hungry.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When the beggar was gone Mr. Anderson thought of his last remark and laughed. He <a id="Page_78" title="[Pg 78]"></a>was a well-known rich man and a good paymaster. An order for a £100 on a dirty slip of paper would be honoured by his banker without hesitation. Naturally he laughed. He forgot that men had committed suicide by drowning to avoid death from thirst. Well, there it was.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The bell announcing breakfast rang punctually at 10 o'clock in the morning. Mr. Anderson joined his wife in the drawing-room and they went to the dining-room together. The smell of eggs and bacon and coffee greeted them and Mr. Anderson forgot all about the Indian beggar when he took his seat. But he received a rude shock. There was a big live caterpillar in the fish. Mr. Anderson called the servant and ordered him to take away the fish and serve with eyes open the next time. The servant who had been in Mr. Anderson's service a long time stared open-mouthed. Only a minute before there was nothing but fish on the plate. Whence came this ugly creature? Well, the plate was removed and another put in its place for the next dish.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When the next dish came another surprise awaited everybody.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As the cover was removed it was found that the whole contents were covered with a thin layer <a id="Page_79" title="[Pg 79]"></a>of sweepings. The Khansama (the servant who serves at the table) looked at Mr. Anderson and Mr. Anderson at the Khansama "with a wild surmise"; the cover was replaced and the dish taken away. Nothing was said this time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After about 5 minutes of waiting a third covered dish was brought.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When the cover was removed the contents were found mixed with stable sweepings. The smell was horrible, the dish was at once removed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This was about the limit.</p>
<p class="calibre1">No man can eat after that. Mr. Anderson left the table and went to his office—without breakfast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the habit of Mr. Anderson to have his lunch in his office. A Khansama used to take a tiffin basket to the office and there in his private room Mr. Anderson ate his lunch punctually at 2 P.M. Today he expected his tiffin early. He thought, that though he had left no instructions himself the Khansama would have the sense to remember that he had gone to office without breakfast. And so Mr. Anderson expected a lunch heavier than usual and earlier too.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But it was two o'clock and the servant had not arrived. Mr. Anderson was a man of parti<a id="Page_80" title="[Pg 80]"></a>cularly regular habits. He was very hungry. The thought of the beggar in the morning made him angry too. He shouted to his punkha coolie to pull harder.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a quarter after two and still the Khansama would not arrive. It was probably the first time in 20 years that the fellow was late. Mr. Anderson sent his <i class="calibre10">chaprasi</i> (peon) to look for the Khansama at about half past two. A couple of minutes after the <i class="calibre10">chaprasi's</i> departure, Mr. Atkins, the Collector of the district, was announced (A Collector is generally a District Magistrate also, and in the Central Provinces he is called the Deputy Commissioner). He is one of the principal officers in the district. In this particular district of which I am speaking there were two principal government officers. The Divisional Judge was the head of the Civil Administration as well as the person who tried the murderers and all other big offenders who deserved more than seven years imprisonment. He was a Bengal Brahman. Mr. Atkins was the Collector or rather the Deputy Commissioner. He was the executive head of the district. He was also the District Magistrate. Mr. Atkins came in and thus explained a sad accident which Mr. Anderson's <i class="calibre10">Khansama</i> had met with:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="Page_81" title="[Pg 81]"></a>"As I was passing along the road in my motor car, your man came in the way and was knocked down. The man is hurt but not badly. He had been carrying a tiffin basket which was also knocked down, as a matter of course; and the car having passed over it everything the basket contained in the shape of china was smashed up. The man has been taken to the hospital by myself in an unconscious condition, but the doctor says there is nothing very serious, and he will be all right in a couple of days."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now Mr. Atkins was a great friend of Mr. Anderson. They had known each other ever since Mr. Atkins's arrival in India as a young member of the Civil Service. That was over 20 years ago. He had at first been in that district for over 7 years as an Assistant Commissioner and this time he was there for over 3 years as a Deputy Commissioner. But Mr. Anderson was very hungry. The story of Mr. Atkins had given him the second shock since the morning. He, therefore, used language which no gentleman should have done; and with great vehemence threatened to prosecute Mr. Atkins for rash driving, etc.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Atkins was a very good-natured man. He knew the temper of Mr. Anderson; but he <a id="Page_82" title="[Pg 82]"></a>had never been Anderson so angry before. He therefore beat a hasty retreat, wondering whether Anderson had not gone mad. He would not have told anybody what happened in Anderson's offices if he had known the starving condition of the millionaire, but as it happened he repeated the fine language that Anderson had used, in the club that same evening. Everybody who heard his story opined at he time that Anderson was clearly off his head.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Anderson and his wife were expected at the club, but they did not turn up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When Mr. Atkins went home he got a letter from Anderson in which the latter had apologised for what he had said in the office that afternoon.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the letter there was a sentence which was rather enigmatic:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"If you know what I am suffering from, Atkins, you will be sorry for me, not angry with me—I pray to God you may not suffer such—." The letter had evidently been written in great haste and had not been revised. Mr. Atkins did not quite understand the matter; and he intended to look up Anderson the first thing next morning. Mr. Atkins thought that Anderson had lost some <a id="Page_83" title="[Pg 83]"></a>of his money. He knew that Anderson never speculated. Still he might have suffered a heavy loss in one of his contracts. He telephoned to Mr. Anderson at his house, but was informed by one of the servants that the master had gone out in his motor car at six in the evening and was not back till then.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now let us see what happened to Mr. Anderson after he had left his office at about four in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He went home and expected some tea, but no tea arrived, though it was six. The Khansama was in the hospital; the cook was called and he humbly offered the following explanation: "As soon as Hazoor (Your Honour) came back I ordered the khidmatgar (the cook's assistant) to put the kettle on the fire. (This is the ordinary duty of the khidmatgar). There was a bright coal fire in the stove, and the khidmatgar put the kettle upon it. The kettle should have boiled within five minutes, but it did not; your humble servant went to investigate the cause and found that there was no water in the kettle. We put in some, but the kettle had in the meantime become nearly red-hot. As soon as it came into contact with the cold water it burst like a bomb. Fortunately nobody was <a id="Page_84" title="[Pg 84]"></a>hurt. There was, of course, a saucepan to heat some water in, but the cold water had got into the stove and extinguished it." It would be another half an hour before tea was ready, he added. Mr. Anderson now realised that it was not the fault of the servants but the curse of the Indian Fakir. So with a sad smile he ordered his motor car and thought that he and his wife had better try the Railway refreshment rooms. When his chauffeur was going to start the engine Mr. Anderson expected that there would be a backfire and the chauffeur would have a dislocated wrist. But there was no accident. The engine started as smoothly as it had never done before. Mr. and Mrs. Anderson went to the Railway refreshment rooms. There they were informed that no tea was available. A dead rat had been found under one of the tables in the first class refreshment room, and as plague cases had been reported earlier in the week, the station master had ordered the rooms to be closed till they had been thoroughly disinfected. The whole staff of waiters with all the preserved meat and oilman's stores had been sent by special train to the next station so that the railway passengers might not be inconvenienced. The next station was eight miles off and there was no road for a motor car.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="Page_85" title="[Pg 85]"></a>"I had expected as much" said Mr. Anderson bitterly, as he left the Railway Station.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I would go to Captain Fraser and beg for some dinner. He is the only man who has got a family here and will be able to accommodate us" said he to his wife, and so off they started for a five mile run to the Cantonments. There was some trouble with the car on the way and they were detained for about an hour, and it was actually 8-30 in the evening when the Andersons reached Captain Fraser's place. Why, instead of going home from the Railway Station, Mr. Anderson went to Captain Fraser's place he himself could not tell.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Andersons reached Captain Fraser's place at half past eight in the evening, Mr. and Mrs. Fraser had not come back from the club. But they were expected every minute. It was in fact nine when the Captain and his wife turned up in a Hackney Carriage. They were surprised to see the Andersons. They had heard the story told by Atkins at the club. Anderson gave them his version. Of course, Captain Fraser asked them to stay to dinner. He said "I am very sorry I am late, but it could not be helped. When returning from the club my horse was alarmed at <a id="Page_86" title="[Pg 86]"></a>something. The coachman lost control and there was a disaster. But, thank God, nobody is seriously hurt."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Their carriage had, however, been so badly damaged that they had to get a hackney carriage to bring them home.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In India, specially in June, they are not particular about the dress. So Captain Fraser said they would sit down to dinner at once and, at a quarter after nine they all went in to dine. The Khansama stared at the uninvited guests. He knew that something had gone wrong with Anderson Saheb.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The soup was the first thing brought in and the trouble began as soon as it came. Captain Fraser's Khansama was an old hand at his business, but somehow he made a mess of things. He got so nervous about what he himself could not explain that he upset a full plate of soup that he had brought for Mr. Anderson not exactly on his head, but on his left ear.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well the reader would understand the situation. There was a plateful of hot soup on Mr. Anderson's left ear. The soup should have got cold, because it had waited long for the Captain's return from the club, but the cook had very prudently warmed <a id="Page_87" title="[Pg 87]"></a>it up again and it had become very warm indeed. Mr. Anderson shouted and the Khansama let go the plate. It fell on the table in front of Mr. Anderson on its edge and rolled on. Next to Mr. Anderson was Mrs. Fraser, and there was a glass of iced-water in front of her. The rolling soup plate upset the glass, and the water and the glass and the plate all came down on Mrs. Fraser's lap, the iced-water making her wet through and through. She was putting on a muslin gown. She had to go and change. Mrs. Anderson at this point got up and said that they would not spoil the Frasers' dinner by their presence. She said that the curse of the Indian Fakir was on them and if they stayed the Frasers would have to go without dinner. Naturally she anticipated that some further difficulty would arise there when the next dish was brought in. The Frasers protested loudly but she dragged Mr. Anderson away. She had forgotten that she had had her lunch and her husband had not.</p>
<p class="calibre1">While going in their motor car from Mr. Fraser's house to their own they had to pass a bazaar on the way. In the bazar there was a sweetmeat shop. Mr. Anderson, whose condition could be better imagined than described asked his <a id="Page_88" title="[Pg 88]"></a>chauffeur to stop at the sweetmeat shop. It was a native shop with a fat native proprietor sitting without any covering upon his body on a low stool. As soon as he saw Mr. Anderson and his wife he rushed out of his shop with joined palms to enquire what the gentleman wanted. Mr. Anderson was evidently very popular with the native tradesmen and shop-keepers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This shop-keeper had special reason to know Mr. Anderson, as it was the latter's custom to give a dinner to all his native workmen on Her Majesty's birthday, and this particular sweetmeat vendor used to get the contract for the catering. The birthday used to be observed in India on the 24th May and it was hardly a fortnight that this man had received a cheque for a pretty large amount from Mr. Anderson, for having supplied Mr. Anderson's native workmen with sweets.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Naturally he rushed out of his shop in that humble attitude. But in doing so he upset a whole dishful of sweets, and the big dish with the sweets went into the road-side drain. All the same the man came up and wanted to know the pleasure of the Saheb. Mr. Anderson told him that he was very hungry and wanted something to eat. "Certainly, Huzoor" said the Halwâi <a id="Page_89" title="[Pg 89]"></a>(Indian Confectioner) and fussily rushed in. He brought out some native sweets in a "<i class="calibre10">dona</i>" (cup made of leaves) but as misfortune would have it Mr. Anderson could not eat anything.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was any amount of petroleum in the sweets. How it got in there was a mystery. Mr. Anderson asked his chauffeur to proceed. For fear of hurting the feeling of this kind old Halwâi Mr. Anderson did not do anything then; but scarcely had the car gone 200 yards when the "<i class="calibre10">dona</i>" with its contents untouched was on the road.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Anderson reached home at about half past ten. He expected to find no dinner at home. But he was relieved to hear from his bearer that dinner was ready. He rushed into his bath-room, had a cold bath and within five minutes was ready for dinner in the dining-room.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But the dinner would not come. After waiting for about 15 minutes the bearer (butler and foot man combined) was dispatched to the kitchen to enquire what the matter was. The cook came with a sad look upon his face and informed him that the dinner had been ready since 8-30 as usual, but as the Saheb had not returned he had kept the food in the kitchen and come out <a id="Page_90" title="[Pg 90]"></a>leaving the kitchen-door open. Unfortunately Mr. Anderson's dogs had finished the dinner in his absence, probably thinking that the master was dining out. In a case like this the cook, who had been in Mr. Anderson's service for a long time, expected to hear some hard words; but Mr. Anderson only laughed loud and long. The cook suggested that he should prepare another dinner, but Mr. Anderson said that it would not be necessary that night. The chauffeur subsequently informed the cook that the master and his wife had dined at Captain Fraser's, and finished with sweets at Gopal Halwai's shop. This explained the master's mirth to the cook's satisfaction.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What happened the next day to Mr. Anderson need not be told. It is too painful and too dirty a story. The fact remains that Mr. Anderson had no solid food the next day either. He thought he should die of starvation. He did not know how much longer the curse was going to last, or what else was in store for him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the morning of the third day the bearer came and reported that a certain Indian Fakir had invited Mr. Anderson to go and breakfast with him. How eagerly husband and wife went! The <a id="Page_91" title="[Pg 91]"></a>Fakir lived in a miserable hut on the bank of the river. He invited the couple inside his hut and gave them bread and water. Here was clean healthy looking bread after all, and Mr. Anderson never counted how many loaves he ate. But he had never eaten food with greater relish and pleasure in his life before. After the meal the Fakir who evidently knew Mr. Anderson said: "Saheb, you are a great man and a good man too. You are rich and you think that riches can purchase everything. You are wrong. The Giver of all things may turn gold into dust and gold may, by His order, lose all its purchasing capacity. This you have seen during the last two days. You have annoyed a man who has no gold but who has power. You think that the Deputy Commissioner has power—but he has not. The Deputy Commissioner gets his power from the King. The man whom you have offended got his power from the King of Kings.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It is His pleasure that you should leave the station. The sooner you leave this place Saheb the better for you or you will starve. You can stay as long as you like here—but you will eat no food outside this hut of mine—you can try.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You can go now and come back for your dinner when you require it—."</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="Page_92" title="[Pg 92]"></a>Mr. Anderson came back to the Fakir's cottage for his dinner, with his wife at nine in the evening.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Early, the next morning, he left the station and never came back.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Within a month he left India for good. The hospitable gentlemen of the station who had asked Mr. and Mrs. Anderson to have a meal with them will never forget the occasion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This story, though it reads like a fairy tale, is nevertheless true.</p>
<p class="calibre1">All the European gentlemen of J—— knew it and if anyone of them happens to read these pages he will be able to certify that every detail is correct.</p>
<p class="tbrk">In this connection it will not be out of place to mention some of the strange doings of the once famous Hasan Khan, the black artist of Calcutta. Fifty years ago there was not an adult in Calcutta who did not know his name and had not seen or at least heard of his marvellous feats.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I have heard any number of wonderful stories but I shall mention only two here which, though evidently not free from exaggeration, will give an idea of what the people came to regard him as <a id="Page_93" title="[Pg 93]"></a>capable of achieving, and also of the powers and attributes which he used to arrogate to himself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What happened was this.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a big reception in Government House at Calcutta. Now a native of Calcutta of those days knew what such a reception meant.</p>
<p class="calibre1">All public roads within half a mile of Government House were closed to wheeled and fast traffic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The large compound was decorated with lamps and Chinese Lanterns in a manner that baffled description. Thousands of these Chinese Lanterns hung from the trees and twinkled among the foliage like so many coloured fire-flies. The drives from the gates to the building had rows of these coloured lanterns on both sides; besides, there were coloured flags and Union Jacks flying from the tops of the poles, round which were coiled wreaths of flowers, and which also served to support the ropes or wires from which these lanterns were suspended.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The main building itself was illuminated with hundreds of thousands of candles or lamps and looked from a distance like a house on fire. From close quarters you could read "Long live the <a id="Page_94" title="[Pg 94]"></a>Queen" written in letters of fire on the parapets of the building, and could see the procession of carriages that passed up and down the drives so artistically decorated, and wonder that the spirited horses did not bolt or shy or kick over the traces when entering those lanes of fire.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There were no electric lights then in Calcutta or in any part of India, no motor cars and no rubber-tyred carriages.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On a reception night lots of people come to watch the decorations of Government House. Now-a-days Government House is illuminated with electricity; but I am told by my elders that in those days when tallow candles and tiny glass lamps were the only means of illumination the thing looked more beautiful and gorgeous.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The people who come to see the illumination pass along the road and are not allowed to stop. The law is that they must walk on and if a young child stops for more than half a minute his guardian, friend, nurse or companion is at once reminded by the policeman on duty that he or she must walk on; and these policemen of Calcutta, unlike the policemen of London, are not at all courteous in their manner or speech.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="Page_95" title="[Pg 95]"></a>So it happened on a certain reception night that Hasan Khan the black artist went to see the decorations and while lingering on the road was rudely told by the policeman on duty to get away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ordinarily Hasan Khan was a man of placid disposition and polite manners. He told the policeman that he should not have been rude to a rate-payer who had only come to enjoy the glorious sight and meant no harm. He also dropped a hint that if the head of the police department knew that a subordinate of his was insulting Hasan Khan it would go hard with that subordinate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This infuriated the policeman who blew his whistle which had the effect of bringing half a dozen other constables on the spot. They then gave poor Hasan Khan a thrashing and reported him to the Inspector on duty. As chance would have it this Inspector had not heard of Hasan Khan before. So he ordered that he should be detained in custody and charged next morning with having assaulted a public officer in the discharge of his duty.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Inspector also received a warning but he did not listen to it. Then Hasan Khan took out a piece of paper and a pencil from his pocket and <a id="Page_96" title="[Pg 96]"></a>wrote down the number of each of the six or seven policemen who had taken part in beating him; and he assured everybody (a large number of persons had gathered now) present that the constables and the Inspector would be dismissed from Government service within the next one hour.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of the people had not seen him before and not knowing who he was, laughed. The Inspector and the constables laughed too. After the mirth had subsided Hasan Khan was ordered to be handcuffed and removed. When the handcuffs had been clapped on he smiled serenely and said "I order that all the lights within half a mile of where we are standing be put out at once." Within a couple of seconds the whole place was in darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The entire Government House Compound which was a mass of fire only a minute before was in total darkness and the street lamps had gone out too. The only light that remained was on the street lamp-post under which our friends were.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The commotion at the reception could be more easily imagined than described.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was total darkness everywhere. The guests were treading literally on each other's toes <a id="Page_97" title="[Pg 97]"></a>and the accidents that happened to the carriages and horses were innumerable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As good luck would have it another Police Inspector who was also on duty and was on horse-back came up to the only light within a circle of half a mile radius.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To him Hasan Khan said "Go and tell your Commissioner of Police that his subordinates have ill-treated Hasan Khan and tell him that I order him to come here at once."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some laughed others scoffed but the Inspector on horse-back went and within ten minutes the Commissioner of the Calcutta Police came along with half a dozen other high officials enquiring what the trouble was about.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To them Hasan Khan told the story of the thrashing he had received and pointed out the assailants. He then told the Commissioner that if those constables and the Inspector who had ordered him to be handcuffed were dismissed, on the spot, from Government service, the lamps would be lighted without human assistance. To the utter surprise of everybody present (including the high officials who had come out with the Commissioner of Police) an order dismissing the constables and the Inspector was passed and <a id="Page_98" title="[Pg 98]"></a>signed by the Commissioner in the dim light shed by that isolated lamp; and within one second of the order the entire compound of Government House was lighted up again, as if some one had switched on a thousand electric lamps controlled by a single button.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Everybody who was present there enjoyed the whole thing excessively, with the exception of the police officers who had been dismissed from service.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It appeared that the Commissioner of Police knew a lot about Hasan Khan and his black art. How he had come to know of Hasan Khan's powers will now be related.</p>
<p class="tbrk">Most of my readers have heard the name of Messrs. Hamilton and Co., Jewellers of Calcutta. They are the oldest and most respectable firm of Jewellers probably in the whole of India.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One day Hasan Khan walked into their shop and asked to see some rings.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He was shown a number of rings but he particularly approved a cheap ring set with a single ruby. The price demanded for this ring was too much for poor honest Hasan Khan's purse, so he <a id="Page_99" title="[Pg 99]"></a>proposed that the Jewellers should let him have the ring on loan for a month.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This, of course, the Jewellers refused to do and in a most un-Englishman-like and unbusiness-like manner a young shop assistant asked him to clear out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He promptly walked out of the shop promising to come again the next day. Before going out of the shop, however, he told one of the managers that the young shop assistant had been very rude to him and would not let him have the ring for a month.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next day there was a slight commotion in Hamilton's shop. The ring was missing. Of course, nobody could suspect Hasan Khan because the ring had been seen by everybody in the shop after his departure. The police were communicated with and were soon on the spot. They were examining the room and the locks and recording statements when Hasan Khan walked in with the missing ring on his finger.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He was at once arrested, charged with theft and taken to the police station and locked up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At about midday he was produced before the Magistrate. When he appeared in court he was found wearing ten rings, one on each finger. He <a id="Page_100" title="[Pg 100]"></a>was remanded and taken back to his cell in the jail.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next morning when the door of his cell was opened it was found that one of the big <i class="calibre10">almirahs</i> in which some gold and silver articles were kept in Hamilton's shop was standing in his cell. Everybody gazed at it dumbfounded. The <i class="calibre10">almirah</i> with its contents must have weighed 50 stones. How it got into the cell was beyond comprehension.</p>
<p class="calibre1">All the big officers of Government came to see the fun and asked Hasan Khan how he had managed it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"How did you manage to get the show-case in your drawing-room?" inquired Hasan Khan of each officer in reply to the question.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And everybody thought that the fellow was mad. But as each officer reached home he found that one show-case (evidently from Hamilton's shop) with all its contents was standing in his drawing room.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next morning Hasan Khan gave out in clear terms that unless Messrs. Hamilton and Co. withdrew the charge against him at once they would find their safe in which were kept the extra <a id="Page_101" title="[Pg 101]"></a>valuable articles, at the bottom of the Bay of Bengal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Jewellers thought that prudence was the best part of valour and the case against Hasan Khan was withdrawn and he was acquitted of all charges and set at liberty.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then arose the big question of compensating him for the incarceration he had suffered; and the ring with the single ruby which he had fancied so much and which had caused all this trouble was presented to him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, Messrs. Hamilton and Co. the Jewellers, had to spend a lot of money in carting back the show-cases that had so mysteriously walked away from their shop, but they were not sorry, because they could not have advertised their ware better, and everybody was anxious to possess something or other from among the contents of these peculiar show-cases.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was in connection with this case that Hasan Khan became known to most of the European Government officials of Calcutta at that time.</p>
