<p class="calibre1">This	old	Oriental	legend	is	so	exquisitely	charming,	so	superior	to	the	Biblical</p>
<p class="calibre1">narrative	of	the	creation	of	woman,	that	it	deserves	to	be	reproduced	in	WOMAN:</p>
<p class="calibre1">HER	SEX	AND	LOVE	LIFE.	There	are	several	variants	of	this	legend,	but	I	reproduce</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	as	it	appeared	in	the	first	issue	of	THE	CRITIC	AND	GUIDE,	January,	1903. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a>At	the	beginning	of	time,	Twashtri—the	Vulcan	of	Hindu	mythology</p>
<p class="calibre1">—created	 the	 world.	 But	 when	 he	 wished	 to	 create	 a	 woman,	 he	 found</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	he	had	employed	all	his	materials	in	the	creation	of	man.	There	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 remain	 one	 solid	 element.	 Then	 Twashtri,	 perplexed,	 fell	 into	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">profound	 meditation	 from	 which	 he	 aroused	 himself	 and	 proceeded	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">follows:</p>
<p class="calibre1">He	took	the	roundness	of	the	moon,	the	undulations	of	the	serpent,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">entwinement	 of	 clinging	 plants,	 the	 trembling	 of	 the	 grass,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">slenderness	of	the	rose-vine	and	the	velvet	of	the	flower,	the	lightness	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	leaf	and	the	glance	of	the	fawn,	the	gaiety	of	the	sun's	rays	and	tears</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	mist,	the	inconstancy	of	the	wind	and	the	timidity	of	the	hare,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">vanity	of	the	peacock	and	the	softness	of	the	down	on	the	throat	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">swallow,	the	hardness	of	the	diamond,	the	sweet	flavor	of	honey	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cruelty	of	the	tiger,	the	warmth	of	fire,	the	chill	of	snow,	the	chatter	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	jay	and	the	cooing	of	the	turtle	dove. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	combined	all	these	and	formed	a	woman.	Then	he	made	a	present</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	her	to	man.	Eight	days	later	the	man	came	to	Twashtri,	and	said:	"My</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord,	 the	 creature	 you	 gave	 me	 poisons	 my	 existence.	 She	 chatters</p>
<p class="calibre1">without	rest,	she	takes	all	my	time,	she	laments	for	nothing	at	all,	and	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">always	ill;	take	her	back;"	and	Twashtri	took	the	woman	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 eight	 days	 later	 the	 man	 came	 again	 to	 the	 god	 and	 said:	 "My</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord,	my	life	is	very	solitary	since	I	returned	this	creature.	I	remember</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	danced	before	me,	singing.	I	recall	how	she	glanced	at	me	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">corner	of	her	eye,	how	she	played	with	me,	clung	to	me.	Give	her	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 me,"	 and	 Twashtri	 returned	 the	 woman	 to	 him.	 Three	 days	 only</p>
<p class="calibre1">passed	and	Twashtri	saw	the	man	coming	to	him	again.	"My	Lord,"	said</p>
<p class="calibre1">he,	"I	do	not	understand	exactly	how	it	is,	but	I	am	sure	that	the	woman</p>
<p class="calibre1">causes	 me	 more	 annoyance	 than	 pleasure.	 I	 beg	 you	 to	 relieve	 me	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Twashtri	cried:	"Go	your	way	and	do	the	best	you	can."	And	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	cried:	"I	cannot	live	with	her!"	"Neither	can	you	live	without	her!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">replied	Twashtri. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 the	 man	 went	 away	 sorrowful,	 murmuring:	 "Woe	 is	 me,	 I	 can</p>
<p class="calibre1">neither	live	with	nor	without	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a><b class="calibre3">PREFACE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	first	chapter	of	this	book	I	have	shown,	I	believe	convincingly,	why	sex</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowledge	 is	 even	 more	 important	 for	 women	 than	 it	 is	 for	 men.	 I	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">examined	carefully	the	books	that	have	been	written	for	girls	and	women,	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">know	that	it	is	not	bias,	nor	carping	criticism,	but	strict	honesty	that	forces	me	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">say	that	I	have	not	found	one	satisfactory	girl's	or	woman's	sex	book.	There	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	 excellent	 books	 for	 girls	 and	 women	 on	 general	 hygiene;	 but	 on	 sex</p>
<p class="calibre1">hygiene,	on	the	general	manifestations	of	the	sex	instinct,	on	sex	ethics—none.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	attempted	to	write	such	a	book.	Whether	I	have	succeeded—fully,	partially</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	not	at	all—is	not	for	me	to	say,	though	I	have	my	suspicions.	But	this	I	know:</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 writing	 this	 book	 I	 have	 been	 strictly	 honest	 with	 myself,	 from	 first	 page	 to last.	Whether	everything	I	have	written	is	the	truth,	I	do	not	know.	But	at	least	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe	that	it	is—or	I	would	not	have	written	it.	And	I	can	solemnly	say	that	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">book	 is	 free	 from	 any	 cant,	 hypocrisy,	 falsehood,	 exaggeration	 or	 compromise, nor	 has	 any	 attempt	 been	 made	 in	 any	 chapter	 to	 conciliate	 the	 stupid,	 the ignorant,	the	pervert,	or	the	sexless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 in	 all	 my	 other	 books	 I	 have	 used	 plain,	 honest	 English.	 Not	 any	 plainer than	necessary,	but	plain	enough	to	avoid	obscurity	and	misconception. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Science	and	art	are	both	necessary	to	human	happiness.	This	is	not	the	place</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	discuss	the	relative	importance	of	the	two.	And,	while	I	have	no	patience	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">art-for-art's-sake,	 I	 recognize	 that	 the	 scientist	 can	 not	 be	 put	 into	 a	 narrow channel	 and	 ordered	 to	 go	 into	 a	 certain	 definite	 direction.	 Scientific</p>
<p class="calibre1">investigations	 which	 seemed	 aimless	 and	 useless	 have	 sometimes	 led	 to	 highly</p>
<p class="calibre1">important	results,	and	I	would	not	disparage	science	for	its	own	sake.	It	has	its</p>
<p class="calibre1">uses.	Nevertheless	I	personally	have	no	use	for	it.	To	me	everything	must	have	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">direct	human	purpose,	a	definite	human	application.	When	the	cup	of	human	life</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 so	 overflowing	 with	 woe	 and	 pain	 and	 misery,	 it	 seems	 to	 me	 a	 narrow</p>
<p class="calibre1">dilettanteism	 or	 downright	 charlatanism	 to	 devote	 one's	 self	 to	 petty	 or	 bizarre problems	 which	 can	 have	 no	 relation	 to	 human	 happiness,	 and	 to	 prate	 of	 self-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>satisfaction	and	self-expression.	One	can	have	all	the	self-expression	one	wants while	doing	useful	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 working	 for	 humanity	 does	 not	 exclude	 a	 healthy	 hedonism;	 not	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">narrow	 Cyrenaic,	 but	 an	 enlightened	 altruistic	 hedonism.	 And	 in	 writing	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1">book	I	have	kept	the	human	problem	constantly	before	my	eyes.	It	was	not	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">ambition	 merely	 to	 impart	 interesting	 facts:	 my	 concern	 was	 the	 practical</p>
<p class="calibre1">application	of	these	facts,	their	relation	to	human	happiness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	this	book	should	be	instrumental,	as	I	confidently	trust	it	will,	in	destroying</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	 medieval	 superstitions,	 in	 dissipating	 some	 hampering	 and	 cramping</p>
<p class="calibre1">errors,	 in	 instilling	 some	 hope	 in	 the	 hearts	 of	 the	 hopeless,	 in	 bringing	 a	 little joy	 into	 the	 homes	 of	 the	 joyless,	 in	 increasing	 in	 however	 slight	 a	 degree	 the sum	total	of	human	happiness,	its	mission	shall	have	been	gloriously	fulfilled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 this	 is	 the	 mission	 of	 the	 book:	 to	 increase	 the	 sum	 total	 of	 human</p>
<p class="calibre1">happiness. </p>

<p class="calibre1">should	 be	 begun	 and	 as	 to	 who	 the	 teacher	 should	 be—the	 father,	 the	 family physician,	 the	 school	 teacher	 or	 a	 specially	 prepared	 book—but	 as	 to	 the</p>

<p class="calibre1">among	the	conservatives	as	well	as	among	the	radicals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	 such	 agreement	 exists	 concerning	 sex	 knowledge	 for	 the	 girl.	 Many	 still</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	 the	 men	 and	 women—and	 not	 among	 the	 conservatives	 only—who	 are</p>
<p class="calibre1">strongly	opposed	to	girls	receiving	any	instruction	in	sex	matters.	Some	say	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">such	 instruction—except	 a	 few	 hygienic	 rules	 about	 menstruation—is</p>
<p class="calibre1">unnecessary,	because	the	sex	instinct	awakens	in	girls	comparatively	late,	and	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 time	 enough	 for	 them	 to	 learn	 about	 such	 matters	 after	 they	 are	 married. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Others	fear	that	sex	knowledge	would	destroy	the	mystery	and	romance	of	sex, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 would	 rob	 our	 maidens	 of	 their	 greatest	 charms—modesty	 and	 innocence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still	others	fear	that	sex	instruction	would	tend	to	awaken	the	sex	instinct	in	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">girls	prematurely;	would	direct	their	thoughts	to	matters	about	which	they	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 think	 otherwise;	 and	 they	 argue	 that	 the	 warnings	 about	 venereal	 disease, prostitution,	 etc.,	 which	 are	 an	 integral	 part	 of	 sex	 instruction,	 tend	 to	 create	 a cynical,	 inimical	 attitude	 towards	 the	 male	 sex,	 which	 may	 even	 result	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">hypochondriac	ideas	and	antagonism	to	marriage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 do	 not	 deny	 that	 there	 is	 a	 grain	 of	 truth	 in	 all	 the	 above	 objections.	 Sex instruction	 does	 cause	  <i class="calibre4">some</i>	 girls	 to	 think	 of	 sex	 matters	 earlier	 than	 they otherwise	would,	and	some	girls	have	been	made	bitter	and	hypochondriac,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">disgusted	with	the	male	sex.	But	it	would	not	be	difficult	to	demonstrate	that	 it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	not	sex	instruction	 <i class="calibre4">per	se</i>	that	was	responsible	for	these	deplorable	results;	it was	 the	  <i class="calibre4">wrong</i>	 kind	 of	 instruction	 that	 was	 to	 blame—it	 was	 the	 wrong emphasis,	the	lurid	exaggerations	that	caused	the	mischief,	and	not	the	truth.	In</p>
<p class="calibre1">other	words,	it	is	not	sex	information,	it	is	sex	misinformation,	that	is	pernicious. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>And,	of	course,	to	this	everybody	will	agree:	rather	than	false	information,	better no	information	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 if	 the	 information	 to	 be	 imparted	 be	 sane,	 honest	 and	 truthful,	 without exaggerating	the	evils	and	without	laying	undue	emphasis	on	the	dark	shadows</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	our	sex	life,	then	the	results	can	be	only	beneficent.	And	the	task	I	have	put</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	 myself	 in	 this	 book	 is	 to	 give	 our	 girls	 and	 women	 sane,	 square	 and honest	information	about	their	sex	organs	and	sex	nature,	information	absolutely</p>
<p class="calibre1">free	 from	 luridness,	 on	 the	 one	 hand,	 and	 maudlin	 sentimentality,	 on	 the	 other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 female	 sex	 is	 in	 need	 of	 such	 information,	 much	 more	 so	 than	 is	 the	 male sex.	 Yes,	 if	 boys,	 as	 is	 now	 universally	 agreed,	 are	 in	 need	 of	 sex	 instruction, then	girls	are	much	more	in	need	of	it.	Why?	For	several	important	reasons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	first	reason	why	sex	instruction	is	even	more	important	for	girls	than	it	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	boys	is	because	a	misstep	in	a	girl	has	much	more	disastrous	consequences</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	it	has	in	a	boy.	The	disastrous	results	of	a	misstep	in	a	boy	are	only	physical</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 character;	 the	 results	 of	 the	  <i class="calibre4">same</i>	 misstep	 in	 a	 girl	 may	 be	 physical,	 moral, social	and	economic.	To	speak	more	plainly.	If	a	boy,	through	ignorance,	rashly</p>
<p class="calibre1">indulges	 in	 illicit	 sexual	 relations,	 the	 worst	 consequence	 to	 him	 may	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">infection	 with	 a	 venereal	 disease.	 But	 he	 is	 not	 considered	 immoral,	 he	 is	 not despised,	he	is	not	ostracized,	he	does	not	lose	his	social	standing	in	the	slightest</p>
<p class="calibre1">degree,	 and	 when	 he	 is	 cured	 of	 his	 venereal	 disease	 he	 has	 no	 difficulty	 in getting	married.	He	does	not	even	have	to	conceal	his	past	sexual	history	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 wife.	 But	 if	 a	 girl	 makes	 a	 misstep	 the	 consequences	 to	 her	 are	 terrible indeed;	it	may	not	only	cost	her	her	health	and	social	standing,	she	may	have	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">pay	with	her	very	life.	She	runs	the	risk	of	venereal	infection	the	same	as	the	boy</p>
<p class="calibre1">does,	 but	 in	 addition	 she	 runs	 the	 risk	 of	 becoming	 pregnant,	 which	 in	 our present	social	system	is	a	catastrophe	indeed.	To	save	herself	from	the	disgrace</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 an	 illegitimate	 child	 she	 may	 have	 an	 abortion	 produced;	 the	 abortion	 may have	no	bad	results,	but	it	may,	if	performed	bunglingly,	leave	her	an	invalid	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">life,	 or	 it	 may	 kill	 her	 outright.	 If	 she	 is	 so	 unfortunate	 as	 to	 be	 unable	 to	 get anybody	 to	 produce	 an	 abortion,	 she	 gives	 birth	 to	 an	 illegitimate	 child,	 which she	is	forced	in	most	cases	to	put	away	in	an	institution	of	some	sort	where	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">hopes	and	prays	it	may	die	soon—and,	in	general,	it	does.	If	it	does	not	die,	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">has	for	the	rest	of	her	life	a	Damocles'	sword	hanging	over	her	head,	and	she	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	constant	terror	lest	her	sin	be	found	out.	She	does	not	permit	herself	to	look</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 a	 mate,	 but	 if	 she	 does	 get	 married,	 the	 specter	 of	 her	 antematrimonial experience	 is	 constantly	 before	 her	 eyes.	 After	 years	 and	 years	 of	 married	 life, the	 husband	 may	 divorce	 her	 if	 he	 finds	 out	 that	 she	 had	 "sinned"	 before	 she knew	 him.	 And	 unless	 the	 husband	 is	 a	 broad-minded	 man	 and	 loves	 her	 truly</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>and	unless	she	made	a	clean	breast	of	everything	to	him	before	marriage,	her	life is	 continuous	 torture.	 But	 even	 if	 the	 girl	 escaped	 pregnancy,	 the	 mere	 finding out	 that	 she	 had	 an	 illicit	 experience	 deprives	 her	 of	 social	 standing,	 or	 makes her	 a	 social	 outcast	 and	 entirely	 destroys	 or	 greatly	 minimizes	 her	 chances	 of ever	 marrying	 and	 establishing	 a	 home	 of	 her	 own.	 She	 must	 remain	 a	 lonely wanderer	to	the	end	of	her	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 enormous	 difference	 in	 the	 results	 of	 a	 misstep	 in	 a	 boy	 and	 a	 girl	 is clearly	seen,	and	for	this	reason	alone,	if	for	no	other,	sex	instruction	is	of	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">importance	to	the	girl	than	it	is	to	the	boy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 there	 are	 other	 important	 reasons,	 and	 one	 of	 them	 is	 beautifully	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">truthfully	expressed	by	Byron	in	his	two	well-known	lines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Man's	love	is	of	man's	life	a	thing	apart, </p>
<p class="calibre1">[30]</p>
<p class="calibre1">'Tis	woman's	whole	existence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes,	love	is	a	woman's	whole	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	modern	women	might	object	to	this.	They	might	say	that	this	was	true</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 woman	 of	 the	 past,	 who	 was	 excluded	 from	 all	 other	 avenues	 of	 human activity.	The	woman	of	the	present	day	has	other	interests	besides	those	of	Love. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 I	 claim	 that	 this	 is	 true	 of	 only	 a	 small	 percentage	 of	 women;	 and	 in	 even this	small	minority	of	women,	social,	scientific	and	artistic	activities	cannot	take</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	place	of	love;	no	matter	how	busy	and	successful	these	women	may	be,	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	tell	you	if	you	enjoy	their	confidence	that	they	are	unhappy,	if	their	love	life</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	unsatisfactory.	Nothing,	nothing	can	fill	the	void	made	by	the	lack	of	love.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">various	activities	may	help	to	cover	up	the	void,	to	protect	it	from	strange	eyes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they	cannot	fill	it.	For	essentially	woman	is	made	for	love.	Not	exclusively,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">essentially,	and	a	woman	who	has	had	no	love	in	her	life	has	been	a	failure.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">few	exceptions	that	may	be	mentioned	only	emphasize	the	rule. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	not	only	psychically	is	a	woman's	love	and	sex	life	more	important	than	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">man's,	 physically	 she	 is	 also	 much	 more	 cognizant	 of	 her	 sex	 and	 much	 more hampered	 by	 the	 manifestation	 of	 her	 sex	 nature	 than	 man	 is.	 To	 take	 but	 one function,	menstruation.	From	the	age	13	or	14	to	the	age	of	forty-five	or	fifty	it	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	monthly	reminder	to	woman	that	she	is	a	woman,	that	she	is	a	creature	of	sex; </p>
<p class="calibre1">and,	while	to	many	women	this	periodically	recurring	function	is	only	a	source</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 some	 annoyance	 or	 discomfort,	 to	 a	 great	 number	 it	 is	 a	 cause	 of	 pain, headache,	 suffering,	 or	 complete	 disability.	 Man	 has	 no	 such	 phenomenon	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>annoy	him	practically	his	whole	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	more	important	are	the	results	of	love-union,	of	sex	relations.	A	man	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 sexual	 relation	 is	 just	 as	 free	 as	 he	 was	 before.	 A	 woman,	 if	 the	 relation	 has resulted	 in	 a	 pregnancy,	 which	 is	 generally	 the	 case,	 unless	 special	 pains	 are taken	it	should	not	so	result,	has	nine	troublesome	months	before	her,	months	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">discomfort	 if	 not	 of	 actual	 suffering;	 she	 then	 has	 an	 extremely	 trying	 and painful	 ordeal,	 that	 of	 childbirth,	 and	 then	 there	 is	 another	 trying	 period,	 the period	of	lactation	or	of	nursing	and	of	bringing	up	the	baby.	The	penalty	seems</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost	too	great. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	when	the	woman	is	on	the	point	of	ceasing	to	menstruate	she	does	not	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	 smoothly	 and	 comfortably.	 She	 has	 to	 go	 through	 a	 period	 called	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">menopause,	which	may	last	one	or	two	years	and	which	may	bring	discomforts</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	dangers	of	its	own.	Man	does	not	have	to	go	through	such	a	distinct	period</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 demarcation	 separating	 his	 sexual	 from	 his	 non-sexual	 life.	 Altogether	 it</p>
<p class="calibre1">cannot	be	denied	that	woman	is	much	more	a	slave	of	her	sex	nature	than	man	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 his.	 Yes,	 Nature	 has	 handicapped	 woman	 much	 more	 heavily	 than	 she	 has</p>
<p class="calibre1">man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 short,	 both	 in	 view	 of	 the	 fact	 that	 sexual	 ignorance	 with	 its	 possible missteps	has	much	more	disastrous	consequences	for	the	girl	than	it	has	for	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">they	 conduct	 the	 eggs	 from	 the	 ovary	 into	 the	 uterus)	 are	 two	 very	 thin	 tubes, extending	 one	 from	 each	 upper	 angle	 of	 the	 womb	 to	 the	 ovaries;	 but	 at	 their ovarian	 end	 they	 expand	 into	 a	 fringed	 and	 trumpet-shaped	 extremity.	 The</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>size	of	a	pear,	with	thick	walls,	capable	under	the	influence	of	pregnancy	of	great expansion	and	growth.	The	broad	part	of	the	pear	is	called	the	 <i class="calibre4">body</i>	of	the	uterus; the	lower	narrow	part	is	called	the	 <i class="calibre4">neck</i>	of	the	uterus,	or	 <i class="calibre4">cervix</i>.	The	uterus	in	the adult	girl	or	woman	is	about	three	inches	long,	two	inches	broad	in	its	upper	part</p>

<p class="calibre1">weight,	as	we	will	see	in	a	future	chapter.	The	cavity	of	the	uterus	is	somewhat</p>
<p class="calibre1">triangular	in	shape;	at	each	upper	angle	is	the	small	opening	communicating	with</p>

<p class="calibre1">The	uterus	is	situated	in	the	center	of	the	pelvis,	between	the	bladder	and	the</p>

An	extreme	degree	of	anteversion	or	anteflexion,	or	retroversion	or retroflexion,	 may	 interfere	 with	 impregnation,	 as	 the	 spermatozoa	 may	 find	 it difficult	or	impossible	to	reach	the	opening	of	the	womb—the	external	os. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Womb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	entire	cavity	of	the	uterus	is	lined	by	a	mucous	membrane<a href="#p33">;[1]	</a>this	mucous membrane	 is	 called	 the	 endometrium	 (endo—within;	 metra—uterus).	 An</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The	 Vagina</b>	 [vagina	 in	 Latin—a	 sheath].	 The	 vagina	 is	 the	 tube	 or	 canal which	serves	as	a	passage-way	between	the	uterus	and	the	outside	of	the	body.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">extends	from	the	external	genitals	or	vulva	to	the	neck	of	the	womb,	embracing</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 latter	 for	 some	 distance.	 It	 is	 a	 strong,	 fibromuscular	 canal,	 lined	 with mucous	 membrane.

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>the	 passage	 of	 a	 child's	 head.	 The	 length	 of	 the	 vaginal	 canal	 is	 between	 three and	 five	 inches,	 but	 it	 is	 in	 general	 much	 more	 capacious	 in	 women	 that	 have borne	one	or	more	children	than	in	those	who	have	not	borne	any. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Near	 the	 vaginal	 entrance	 are	 situated	 two	 small	 glands;	 they	 are	 about	 the size	of	a	pea,	and	secrete	mucus.	They	are	called	Bartholin's	glands;	occasionally</p>

<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 hymen	 there	 is	 an	 opening	 which	 permits	 any	 secretion	 from	 the	 vagina and	the	blood	from	the	uterus	to	come	through.	In	rare	cases	there	is	no	opening</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 hymen,	 that	 is,	 the	 vagina	 is	 entirely	 closed.	 Such	 a	 hymen	 is	 called <i class="calibre4">imperforate</i>	 (not	 perforated).	 When	 the	 girl	 begins	 to	 menstruate,	 the	 blood cannot	come	out	and	it	accumulates	in	the	vagina.	In	such	cases	the	hymen	must</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 opened	 or	 slit	 by	 a	 doctor.	 In	 some	 cases	 the	 hymen	 is	 congenitally	 absent; that	is,	the	girl	is	born	without	any	hymen.	While	the	hymen	is	usually	ruptured</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>during	 the	 first	 intercourse,	 it,	 in	 some	 cases,	 being	 elastic	 and	 stretchable, persists	untorn	after	sexual	intercourse.	It	will	therefore	be	seen	that	just	as	the</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">FUNCTION	OF	THE	OVARIES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	 the	 testicles	 in	 man,	 so	 the	 ovaries	 in	 woman	 are	 the	 essential	 sexual organs.	They	are	the	fundamental	organs,	without	which	the	other	sexual	organs</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>are	 useless.	 Also	 like	 the	 testicles	 in	 man,	 the	 ovaries	 have	 two	 distinct functions,	manufacturing	two	distinct	substances.	One	function	is	to	manufacture</p>
<p class="calibre1">eggs;	this,	called	the	oögenetic	or	egg-producing	function,	is	its	 <i class="calibre4">racial</i>	 function; without	 it	 the	 race	 could	 not	 perpetuate	 itself.	 But	 the	 ovary	 has	 also	 an <i class="calibre4">individual</i>	 function.	 Besides	 the	 ova,	 the	 ovary	 manufactures	 what	 we	 call	 an <i class="calibre4">internal</i>	 secretion	 which	 is	 absorbed	 by	 the	 blood,	 and	 which	 is	 of	 the	 greatest importance	to	the	woman	herself.	While	the	manufacture	of	ova	begins	only	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">puberty,	with	menstruation,	and	closes	at	the	menopause,	the	manufacture	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">internal	secretion	lasts	throughout	the	woman's	entire	life.	This	secretion,	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">consists	of	various	chemical	substances,	has	a	tremendous	influence	not	only	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	development	of	the	woman's	body,	but	also	on	her	feelings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First	 of	 all	 it	 is	 necessary	 for	 the	 development	 of	 the	 woman's	 special</p>
<p class="calibre1">characteristics,	or	 <i class="calibre4">secondary	sexual	characters</i>.	Without	that	internal	secretion	of the	ovaries,	a	woman	would	look	more	or	less	like	a	man;	she	would	not	develop</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	beautiful	rounded	form,	her	pretty	long	hair,	her	breasts,	her	broad	pelvis,	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">feminine	voice,	etc.  <i class="calibre4">Second</i>,	the	secretion	is	necessary	to	the	proper	development of	 her	 other	 sexual	 organs;	 if	 the	 ovaries	 are	 cut	 out,	 then	 the	 uterus	 and	 the vagina	 and	 even	 the	 vulva	 shrivel	 up.  <i class="calibre4">Third</i>,	 it	 is	 that	 internal	 secretion	 that excites	in	woman	sexual	desire	and	makes	her	enjoy	relations	with	the	male	sex. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	the	ovaries	are	cut	away,	particularly	if	it	is	done	early	in	life,	the	woman	has</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	sexual	desire	and	no	enjoyment.  <i class="calibre4">Fourth</i>,	it	contributes	to	the	general	health, wellbeing,	energy,	and	mental	alertness	of	the	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	see	the	importance	of	the	internal	ovarian	secretion,	and	you	will	readily</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand	 why,	 when	 the	 ovaries	 are	 removed	 by	 operation,	 the	 woman, </p>
<p class="calibre1">particularly	 if	 she	 is	 young,	 undergoes	 such	 marked	 changes.	 It	 is	 because	 we recognize	 now	 the	 great	 importance	 of	 the	 ovaries	 that	 we	 always,	 when</p>
<p class="calibre1">operating	 on	 diseased	 ovaries	 leave	 at	 least	 a	 small	 piece	 of	 ovary,	 if	 at	 all possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Number	of	Ova. </b>	When	the	female	infant	is	born,	her	ovaries	contain	as	many</p>
<p class="calibre1">ova	or	eggs	as	they	ever	will	contain.	In	fact,	they	contain	more	than	they	will	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">puberty.	For	it	is	estimated	that	at	birth	each	ovary	contains	about	100,000	ova; </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	majority	of	these,	however,	disappear	so	that	at	the	age	of	puberty	each	ovary</p>
<p class="calibre1">contains	only	about	30,000	ova.	As	only	one	ovum	ripens	each	month	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	of	puberty	to	the	time	of	the	menopause	(i.e.,	about	300	to	400	ova	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">utmost	during	a	lifetime),	and	as	only	a	dozen	or	two	ova	would	be	necessary	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 propagation	 of	 the	 race,	 it	 seems	 a	 superabundance	 of	 ova,	 an	 unnecessary lavishness.	 But	 nature	  <i class="calibre4">is</i>	 lavish	 where	 the	 propagation	 of	 the	 species	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>concerned.	A	portion	of	an	ovary	or	of	both	ovaries	might	become	diseased,	and thousands	of	ova	might	become	unfit	for	fertilization;	nature	therefore	puts	in	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">extra	 reserve	 supply.	 We	 see	 a	 still	 more	 striking	 example	 of	 this	 extreme</p>
<p class="calibre1">extravagant	 lavishness	 in	 man;	 only	 one	 spermatozoön	 is	 necessary	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">impregnate	 the	 ovum,	 and	 only	 one	 spermatozoön	 can	 penetrate	 the	 ovum; </p>
<p class="calibre1">nevertheless	 each	 normal	 ejaculation	 of	 semen	 contains	 between	 a	 quarter	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">half	a	million	spermatozoa. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The	Graafian	Follicles. </b>	Each	primitive	or	primordial	ovu<a href="#p40">m[3]</a>	is	imbedded	in a	 little	 vesicle	 or	 follicle,	 which	 is	 generally	 known	 as	  <i class="calibre4">Graafian	 follicle</i>,	 and there	 are	 as	 many	 Graafian	 follicles	 as	 there	 are	 ova.	 (The	 Graafian	 follicles were	first	described	about	250	years	ago—in	1672—by	a	Delft	physician	named</p>
<p class="calibre1">De	 Graaf,	 hence	 the	 name.)	 Until	 puberty,	 that	 is	 the	 commencement	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">menstruation,	 the	 Graafian	 follicles	 with	 the	 oöcytes	 or	 primitive	 ova	 are	 in	 a more	or	less	dormant	condition.	But	with	the	onset	of	puberty	there	commences</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 period	 of	 intense	 activity	 in	 the	 ovaries.	 This	 period	 of	 activity	 is	 repeated regularly	 once	 a	 month,	 and	 it	 constitutes	 the	 process	 of	  <i class="calibre4">ovulation</i>	 and <i class="calibre4">menstruation</i>.	 The	 two	 processes	 are	 closely	 though	 not	 causally	 connected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ovulation	 consists	 in	 the	 monthly	 maturation	 and	 extrusion	 of	 a	 ripe	 ovum; </p>
<p class="calibre1">menstruation,	 which	 will	 be	 further	 discussed	 in	 a	 separate	 chapter,	 consists	 in the	monthly	discharge	of	blood,	mixed	with	mucus	from	the	inside	lining	of	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">Before	 the	 follicle	 bursts,	 it	 swells	 and	 enlarges	 and	 reaches	 the	 surface	 of	 the ovary;	 the	 whole	 follicle	 is	 congested	 with	 blood,	 but	 at	 one	 point	 near	 the surface	of	the	ovary	it	is	pale	and	thin,	and	here	the	rupture	takes	place. </p>

<p class="calibre1">fluid	in	women	is	not	a	vital	fluid	like	the	semen	in	man;	it	is	merely	mucus,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 some	 women	 it	 is	 very	 slight	 in	 amount	 or	 altogether	 absent.	 Adult	 women who	live	without	sexual	relations	occasionally	have	sexual	or	erotic	dreams;	that</p>

<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 male	 sex	 pollutions	 play	 an	 important	 rôle	 (see	 the	 author's	 "Sex Knowledge	 for	 men"),	 because	 the	 semen	 is	 a	 vital	 fluid,	 and	 if	 it	 is	 lost	 too frequently	the	system	is	put	under	a	heavy	drain.	In	boys	and	men	the	pollutions</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	 night	 losses	 may	 occur	 several	 times	 a	 week	 or	 even	 every	 night,	 or	 several times	 a	 night.	 When	 they	 occur	 with	 such	 frequency	 the	 man	 may	 become	 a</p>

<p class="calibre1">Puberty	 is	 the	 most	 wonderful,	 the	 most	 significant	 period	 in	 a	 girl's	 life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Important	as	it	is	in	a	boy's	life	and	development,	it	is	still	more	so	in	a	girl's.	At this	 period	 there	 are	 often	 laid	 the	 foundations	 which	 either	 make	 or	 mar	 the girl's	future	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	meaning	of	the	word	puberty	is	maturity.	It	is	the	period	at	which	the	girl</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 the	 boy	 reach	 sexual	 maturity;	 in	 other	 words,	 the	 period	 at	 which	 the	 sex glands	of	the	boy	begin	to	generate	spermatozoa,	and	the	sex	glands	of	the	girl</p>
<p class="calibre1">begin	 to	 mature	 and	 expel	 eggs	 or	 ova;	 with	 the	 girl	 puberty	 is	 marked	 by	 an additional	 phenomenon,	 which	 has	 no	 analogue	 in	 the	 boy,	 namely, </p>
<p class="calibre1">menstruation. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Physical	Changes. </b>	The	word	puberty	is	derived	from	the	word	 <i class="calibre4">puber</i>,	 which in	Latin	means	mature,	ripe.	But	the	word	puber	is	itself	derived	from	the	word</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">pubes</i>,	which	in	Latin	means	fine	hair	or	down.	For	at	this	period	of	maturity	all mammals	 (that	 is	 animals	 which	 have	 breasts	 and	 nurse	 their	 young)	 begin	 to develop	a	growth	of	hair.	You	know	that	our	entire	body,	with	the	exception	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	palms	of	the	hands	and	the	soles	of	the	feet,	is	covered	with	innumerable	hair</p>
<p class="calibre1">follicles,	 and	 from	 our	 birth	 our	 entire	 body,	 with	 the	 exception	 named,	 is covered	 with	 fine	 hair.	 The	 hair	 may	 be	 too	 delicate	 to	 be	 seen,	 but	 it	 is	 there, and	with	a	magnifying	glass	you	can	see	it	without	any	trouble.	But	at	puberty</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	hair	increases	in	thickness	and	in	quantity,	and	becomes	abundant	in	places</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	 it	 was	 hardly	 noticeable	 before—the	 upper	 lip	 and	 face	 in	 boys,	 and	 the armpits	and	lower	part	of	the	abdomen	in	both	boys	and	girls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 so	 the	 first	 apparent	 physical	 sign	 of	 puberty	 in	 a	 girl	 is	 the	 gradual appearance	of	hair	in	the	armpits,	on	the	mons	Veneris	and	the	labia	majora.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	 the	 genital	 organs	 are	 undergoing	 rapid	 development;	 the	 vulva,	 the	 vagina, the	uterus	and	the	ovaries	become	larger,	and	the	ovaries	which	up	to	that	time</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	elaborating	an	internal	secretion	only,	now	also	begin	to	manufacture	ova; </p>
<p class="calibre1">in	other	words,	the	monthly	process	of	ovulation	is	begun.	Synchronously	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	process	of	ovulation,	there	commences	the	monthly	function	of	menstruation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	breasts	also	increase	in	size,	assume	the	characteristic	contour,	develop	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">glandular	 substance,	 and	 become	 capable	 of	 secreting	 milk	 for	 the	 use	 of	 any possible	 offspring.	 During	 this	 period	 of	 development	 they	 are	 often	 very</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>sensitive	to	the	touch	or	feel	painful	without	being	touched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	not	only	the	genital	organs	undergo	growth	and	development—the	entire</p>
<p class="calibre1">body	 participates	 in	 the	 process.	 The	 growth	 in	 height	 is	 the	 most	 rapid	 at	 this period;	the	greatest	growth	takes	place	in	the	limbs—legs	and	arms.	The	pelvis</p>
<p class="calibre1">becomes	broader,	and	the	chest	or	thorax	also	becomes	broader	and	larger.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">muscles	 become	 larger	 and	 rounder	 and	 finally	 give	 the	 girl	 the	 beautiful</p>
<p class="calibre1">womanly	form. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Psychic	 Changes. </b>	 But	 the	 changes	 are	 not	 only	 physical;	 the	 changes	 that take	 place	 in	 the	 girl's	 psychic	 sphere	 during	 the	 pubertal	 years	 are	 also	 highly important.	 That	 is	 the	 period	 of	 the	 development	 of	 the	 emotions;	 she	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">overflowing	with	emotion;	she	becomes	sensitive;	in	her	relations	with	boys	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">men	 she	 becomes	 self-conscious.	 Distinct	 sexual	 desire	 fortunately	 does	 not</p>
<p class="calibre1">make	 its	 appearance	 in	 the	 girl	 at	 this	 period,	 as	 it	 does	 in	 the	 boy,	 but	 she becomes	 filled	 with	 vague	 undefined	 and	 undefinable	 longings.	 It	 is	 the	 period of	 "crushes"	 when	 the	 girl	 is	 apt	 to	 bestow	 her	 overflowing	 emotion	 on	 a	 girl friend.	 There	 is	 nothing	 reprehensible	 in	 these	 crushes—they	 act	 as	 a	 safety valve—and	only	in	rare	cases	are	they	apt	to	lead	to	abnormal	development.	This</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	also	the	period	of	day-dreaming	and	of	romancing;	the	girl	likes	to	read	love-</p>
<p class="calibre1">stories	and	novels	in	which	she	identifies	herself	with	the	heroine.	And	it	makes</p>
<p class="calibre1">quite	 some	 difference	 as	 to	 what	 the	 girl	 reads	 during	 this	 period,	 for	 literature has	a	strong	influence	on	the	young	in	the	most	plastic	period	of	their	lives;	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	is	important	that	older	persons	see	to	it	that	those	in	their	care	spend	their	time</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	books	of	noble	ideals	and	high	artistic	value. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Girls	 of	 a	 highly	 sensitive	 or	 so-called	 "nervous"	 temperament,	 especially	 if there	 is	 "nervousness"	 in	 the	 family,	 must	 be	 particularly	 looked	 after.	 For	 it	 is during	 the	 years	 of	 puberty	 and	 adolescence	 that	 any	 neurotic	 traits	 are	 apt	 to develop	 and	 become	 emphasized.	 It	 is	 also	 the	 period	 when	 bad	 sexual	 habits (masturbation)	 are	 apt	 to	 develop,	 and	 the	 careful	 mother	 will	 devote	 special attention	 to	 her	 girls	 in	 their	 years	 of	 puberty,	 and	 guard	 them	 as	 much	 as possible	against	physical	and	emotional	shocks. </p>

<p class="calibre1">What	 is	 menstruation?	 Menstruation	 is	 a	 monthly	 discharge	 of	 blood.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>word	 is	 derived	 from	 the	 Latin	 word	 mensis,	 which	 means	 a	 month;	 and menstruation	 is	 also	 frequently	 spoken	 of	 as	  <i class="calibre4">the	 menses</i>.	 It	 is	 also	 called	 the catamenia	 or	 catamenia-flow	 (Greek,	 kata—by,	 men—a	 month).	 Other	 terms</p>
<p class="calibre1">are:	 the	 periods,	 courses,	 monthlies,	 turns,	 monthly	 changes,	 monthly	 sickness, sickness,	flowers,	to	be	unwell,	to	be	regular.	"Not	to	see	anything"	is	a	common term	for	having	missed	the	menses.	This	flow	of	blood	recurs	in	most	cases	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">remarkable	 regularity	 once	 a	 month;	 not	 a	 calendar	 month,	 but	 once	 a	 lunar</p>
<p class="calibre1">month,	i.e.,	once	every	twenty-eight	days.	And	as	there	are	thirteen	lunar	months</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	year,	a	woman	menstruates	not	twelve	but	thirteen	times	a	year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where	 does	 the	 menstrual	 blood	 come	 from?	 The	 menstrual	 blood	 comes</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	inside	of	the	womb.	Every	month,	for	a	few	days	prior	to	menstruation, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 inside	 lining	 of	 the	 womb	 (what	 we	 call	 the	 mucous	 membrane	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1">endometrium)	 becomes	 congested	 and	 its	 bloodvessels	 become	 distended	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">blood.	If	the	woman	has	sexual	intercourse	and	pregnancy	happens	to	take	place, </p>
<p class="calibre1">then	 this	 extra	 blood	 is	 used	 to	 nourish	 and	 develop	 the	 new	 child;	 but	 if	 no pregnancy	 takes	 place,	 that	 extra	 blood	 exudes	 from	 the	 bloodvessels	 (some	 of the	bloodvessels	rupture)	and	is	discharged	from	the	uterus	into	the	vagina,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	there	to	the	outside,	where	it	is	caught	on	cotton,	sanitary	napkins	or	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">other	pad. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">At	what	age	does	menstruation	begin? </b>	The	usual	age	at	which	menstruation</p>
<p class="calibre1">begins	 in	 this	 country	 is	 thirteen	 or	 fourteen;	 in	 some	 it	 may	 occur	 as	 early	 as twelve,	in	others	as	late	as	fifteen,	sixteen	or	even	seventeen.	For	menstruation	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">begin	 earlier	 than	 twelve	 or	 later	 than	 seventeen	 is	 in	 this	 country	 a	 rare exception.	 But	 in	 cold	 northern	 climates	 the	 age	 of	 eighteen	 is	 not	 rare,	 and	 in the	hot	southern	climates	menstruation	often	starts	at	the	ages	of	ten	or	eleven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Change	of	climate	or	of	country	will	often	have	an	influence	on	the	menses.	In</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 early	 years	 of	 his	 medical	 practice,	 the	 author	 had	 many	 Finnish	 girls	 as patients.	It	was	a	very	common	occurrence	for	them	to	stop	menstruating	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">first	few	months	or	even	for	the	first	year	of	their	residence	in	this	country. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">At	 what	 age	 does	 menstruation	 cease? </b>	 The	 age	 at	 which	 menstruation</p>
<p class="calibre1">ceases	is	called	the	 <i class="calibre4">menopause</i>	or	 <i class="calibre4">climacteric</i>.	It	usually	takes	place	at	the	age	of forty-eight	or	fifty.	In	some	cases	it	does	not	take	place	until	the	age	of	fifty-two, </p>
<p class="calibre1">in	others	it	takes	place	as	early	as	forty-five	or	forty-four.	In	general,	it	may	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	 that	 the	 woman's	 menstruating	 period,	 during	 which	 she	 is	 able	 to	 have children,	 lasts	 about	 thirty-five	 years.	 And	 if	 no	 restraint	 be	 taken,	 and	 if	 no precautions	 be	 taken	 against	 conception,	 a	 woman	 could	 have	 twenty	 or	 thirty children	during	her	childbearing	period. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a><b class="calibre3">How	 many	 days	 does	 a	 woman	 menstruate? </b>	 The	 usual	 number	 of	 days	 is from	three	to	five;	in	some	cases	menstruation	lasts	only	two	days,	in	others	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">long	as	seven.	As	a	rule,	the	greatest	amount	of	blood	passed	is	during	the	first</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The	amount	of	blood. </b>	It	is	hard	to	estimate	the	exact	amount	of	blood	passed</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	a	woman	during	her	menses,	but	it	reaches	about	an	ounce	and	a	half	to	three</p>
<p class="calibre1">ounces.	In	some	women	the	amount	may	reach	as	much	as	four	or	five	ounces</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	in	exceptional	cases	as	much	as	eight	ounces.	Where	it	exceeds	this	amount, </p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 is	 an	 abnormal	 condition,	 requiring	 treatment.	 The	 usual	 statement	 that	 a normally	 menstruating	 woman	 should	 not	 have	 to	 use	 more	 than	 three	 napkins</p>
<p class="calibre1">during	the	twenty-four	hours	is	correct. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The	periodical	regularity</i>	 with	 which	 menstruation	 recurs	 in	 many	 women	 is remarkable.	 I	 know	 a	 woman	 who	 has	 not	 missed	 her	 menses	 in	 twenty	 years; </p>
<p class="calibre1">during	 those	 twenty	 years	 the	 menses	 have	 started	 every	 fourth	 Friday,	 almost always	at	the	same	hour.	I	know	another	one	who	has	her	menses	every	fourth</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wednesday,	about	seven	in	the	morning.	She	skipped	her	periods	during	her	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">pregnancies,	 then	 they	 were	 irregular	 for	 a	 while,	 then	 they	 came	 back	 to</p>

<p class="calibre1">from	 becomes	 aggravated	 around	 the	 periods;	 the	 menstrual	 blood	 of	 some</p>
<p class="calibre1">women	 has	 a	 decided	 odor,	 and	 if	 no	 cleansing	 douche	 is	 taken	 during	 four	 or five	 days,	 some	 of	 the	 blood	 decomposes	 and	 acquires	 a	 decidedly	 offensive</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Fecundation</b>	 or	 fertilization	 is	 the	 process	 of	 union	 of	 the	 female	 germ	 cell with	 the	 male	 germ	 cell;	 speaking	 of	 animals,	 it	 is	 the	 process	 of	 union	 of	 the egg	 or	 ovum	 of	 the	 female	 with	 the	 spermatozoön	 of	 the	 male.

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The	 Process. </i>	 The	 process	 of	 fecundation	 is	 briefly	 as	 follows.	 An	 ovum becomes	mature,	breaks	through	its	Graafian	follicle	in	the	ovary	and	is	set	free. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	caught	by	the	fimbriated	or	trumpet-shaped	extremity	of	the	Fallopian	tube</p>
<p class="calibre1">and,	 moved	 by	 the	 wave-like	 motion	 of	 the	 cilia<a href="#p54">[4]	 </a>of	 the	 lining	 of	 the	 tube,	 it begins	 its	 travel	 towards	 the	 uterus.

<p class="calibre1">discharge.	 But	 if	 intercourse	 has	 taken	 place,	 thousands	 and	 thousands	 of	 the male	germ	cells	or	spermatozoa	enter	the	uterus	through	its	opening	or	external</p>
<p class="calibre1">os,	 and	 begin	 to	 travel	 upward	 in	 search	 of	 the	 ovum.	 The	 spermatozoa	 are</p>
<p class="calibre1">capable	of	independent	motion,	and	they	travel	pretty	fast.	It	is	claimed	that	they</p>

<p class="calibre1">the	journey	up	through	the	uterus	to	the	tube.	When	near	the	little	ovum,	which</p>

<p class="calibre1">From	 the	 moment	 the	 ovum	 has	 been	 fertilized	 or	 fecundated	 by	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">spermatozoön,	 the	 woman	 is	 said	 to	 be	 pregnant	 (or	 in	 French	  <i class="calibre4">enceinte</i>.	 This term	was	used	very	frequently	and	is	still	used	by	prudes,	who	seem	to	consider</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	word	pregnant	vulgar	and	disgraceful).	Pregnancy,	or	the	period	of	gestation, </p>
<p class="calibre1">lasts	 from	 the	 moment	 of	 conception	 to	 the	 moment	 that	 the	 fetus	 or	 child	 is expelled	 from	 the	 uterus.	 The	 period	 of	 pregnancy	 differs	 very	 widely	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">different	animals, <a href="#p58">[6]	</a>but	in	the	human	female	it	lasts	nine	calendar	months	or	ten lunar	months—from	about	274	to	280	days.	We	usually	count	280	days	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">first</i>	 day	 of	 the	  <i class="calibre4">last</i>	 menstruation.	 A	 pregnant	 woman	 generally	 wants	 to	 know the	day	of	the	expected	confinement—for	this	purpose	a	table	is	appended	to	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">chapter.	 If	 you	 know	 the	 first	 day	 of	 your	 last	 menstruation,	 you	 will	 see	 at	 a glance	when	the	confinement	may	be	expected.	There	may	be	a	difference	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">few	 days—either	 before	 or	 after	 the	 expected	 date—but	 for	 practical</p>
<p class="calibre1">approximate	purposes	the	tables	serve	very	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	simple	way	is	to	count	back	three	months	and	add	seven	days.	For	instance, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a	woman's	last	menstruation	occurred	on	April	4th;	counting	back	three	months</p>
<p class="calibre1">gives	 you	 January	 4th;	 add	 seven	 days	 and	 you	 get	 January	 11th,	 the	 probable date	 of	 delivery.	 The	 first	 day	 of	 the	 last	 menstruation	 was	 December	 30th; counting	back	three	months	gives	you	September	30th;	add	seven	days	and	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	 October	 6th,	 the	 probable	 date	 of	 delivery.	 The	 presence	 of	 a	 short	 month like	February	may	be	disregarded,	as	the	calculation	is	not	absolutely,	but	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">approximately	correct. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 period	 at	 which	 the	 child's	 movements	 begin	 to	 be	 felt	 by	 the	 mother	 is termed	Quickening.	It	usually	occurs	at	the	middle	of	the	pregnancy,	between	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">16th	and	18th	week. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pregnancy	 is	 a	 normal	 physiological	 process;	 but	 every	 active	 physiological</p>
<p class="calibre1">process	 is	 apt	 to	 be	 accompanied	 by	 disturbances,	 and	 there	 is	 certainly	 no process	in	the	animal	body	in	which	greater	activity,	greater	changes,	go	on	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">during	 the	 process	 of	 pregnancy.	 Just	 see	 what	 occurs	 in	 nine	 months.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">uterus,	at	first	the	size	of	a	small	pear,	reaches	a	size	larger	than	that	of	the	head</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 a	 big	 man;	 it	 does	 not	 merely	 stretch,	 as	 some	 think,	 but	 it	 actually	 grows enormously	 in	 size,	 the	 muscular	 walls	 of	 a	 pregnant	 uterus	 being	 many	 times thicker	 than	 those	 of	 a	 non-pregnant	 one.	 They	 have	 to	 be	 or	 they	 would	 not have	 the	 strength	 to	 expel	 the	 child,	 when	 the	 proper	 time	 comes.	 It	 is	 to	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>borne	 in	 mind	 that	 the	 child	 does	 not	 slip	 out	 by	 itself;	 it	 is	 the	 powerful muscular	contractions	of	the	uterus	that	push	it	out.	If	the	uterus	should	refuse	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">work,	 if	 its	 walls	 were	 too	 thin	 or	 too	 weak,	 the	 child	 could	 not	 come	 out,	 but would	have	to	be	taken	out	with	forceps.	Still	greater	changes	than	in	the	uterus</p>
<p class="calibre1">take	 place	 in	 the	 child	 itself.	 At	 the	 moment	 of	 conception	 it	 is	 the	 size	 of	  <i class="calibre4">the</i> <i class="calibre4">head	of	a	pin</i>;	at	the	moment	of	birth	it	weighs	from	seven	to	ten	pounds;	at	the moment	of	conception	it	is	a	minute,	undifferentiated	mass	of	protoplasm,	just	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">single	fertilized	cell;	at	the	moment	of	birth	it	consists	of	millions	and	millions</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	cells,	which	have	become	differentiated	into	numerous	harmoniously	working</p>

<p class="calibre1">remarkable	how	smooth	and	easy	the	entire	course	is	with	some	women.	Many</p>
<p class="calibre1">women	know	that	they	are	pregnant	only	because	of	the	non-appearance	of	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">to	 all	 their	 work	 and	 pleasures	 as	 usual;	 and	 even	 childbirth	 is	 a	 trifling	 matter with	 them.	 Unfortunately	 the	 number	 of	 such	 women	 is	 not	 very	 large,	 and, </p>
<p class="calibre1">because	of	our	confined,	unnatural,	often	exhausting	way	of	living,	is	becoming</p>
<p class="calibre1">smaller	and	smaller.	There	is	no	question	that	the	civilized,	refined	woman	has	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">harder	 ordeal	 in	 pregnancy	 and	 childbirth	 than	 has	 her	 primitive	 sister.	 We</p>
<p class="calibre1">confidently	hope	that	this	will	not	be	so	in	the	future;	we	expect	the	time	to	come</p>

<p class="calibre1">girl,	and	then	pregnancy	and	parturition	may	become	even	easier	processes	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	are	in	the	primitive	races.	But	the	time	is	not	yet;	and	in	the	meantime	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">young	women	have	a	good	deal	to	go	through. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Morning	Sickness. </b>	 One	 of	 the	 commonest	 disorders	 of	 pregnancy	 is	 the	 so-called	 morning	 sickness.	 This	 consists	 in	 a	 feeling	 of	 nausea	 and	 vomiting, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which	 comes	 on	 soon	 after	 getting	 up.	 The	 morning	 sickness	 makes	 its	 first</p>
<p class="calibre1">appearance	in	the	third,	fourth	or	fifth	week	of	pregnancy	and	lasts	usually	until</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 end	 of	 the	 third	 or	 fourth	 month.	 In	 some	 women,	 however,	 the	 morning</p>
<p class="calibre1">sickness	 comes	 on	 in	 a	 few	 days	 after	 impregnation	 has	 taken	 place,	 and	 those women	 diagnose	 their	 condition	 unmistakably	 by	 the	 feeling	 of	 slight	 nausea</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	 they	 experience	 on	 getting	 up.	 Medicines	 are	 as	 a	 rule	 of	 little	 use	 in treating	 morning	 sickness.	 The	 "disease"	 can	 be	 relieved	 but	 not	 cured.	 The patient	should	stay	in	bed	later	than	usual,	should	have	her	breakfast	in	bed,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">then	not	get	up	for	about	half	an	hour	afterward.	If	the	patient	is	anemic,	a	good</p>
<p class="calibre1">iron	preparation	may	prove	useful. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Pernicious	 Vomiting. </b>	 The	 vomiting	 of	 pregnancy	 sometimes	 becomes	 so</p>
<p class="calibre1">severe	and	uncontrollable	that	it	has	been	given	the	name	pernicious.	The	patient</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	unable	to	retain	any	kind	of	food,	not	even	liquids,	vomits	almost	incessantly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	may	become	very	much	run	down	and	exhausted.	The	vomited	matter	may</p>
<p class="calibre1">contain	blood.	For	this	condition	a	competent	physician	must	be	consulted,	for	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	 cases	 the	 patient's	 life	 may	 be	 in	 danger	 and	 an	 abortion	 has	 to	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a>performed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Capricious	 Appetite. </b>	 A	 capricious	 appetite	 is	 very	 common	 in	 pregnancy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	capriciousness	may	express	itself	in	four	different	directions:	(1)	The	patient</p>
<p class="calibre1">may	lose	her	appetite,	almost	altogether,	partaking	only	of	very	little	food,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 with	 effort.	 This	 condition	 of	 loss	 of	 appetite	 is	 called	 anorexia.	 (2)	 The patient	 may	 develop	 an	 enormous	 appetite—what	 we	 call	 bulimia—eating</p>
<p class="calibre1">several	times	as	much	as	she	does	ordinarily.	(3)	She	may	develop	an	aversion</p>
<p class="calibre1">towards	certain	articles	of	food.	Thus	many	women	develop	an	aversion	towards</p>
<p class="calibre1">meat,	the	mere	sight	of	or	talk	about	meat	causing	in	them	a	sensation	of	nausea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(4)	She	may	show	a	craving	for	the	most	peculiar	articles	of	food	and	for	articles</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	are	not	food	at	all.	The	craving	for	sour	pickles	or	sour	cabbage	is	well-</p>
<p class="calibre1">known;	but	some	women	will	eat	chalk,	sand,	and	even	more	peculiar	things	(for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	chalk	there	may	be	a	reason:	the	system	needs	an	extra	amount	of	lime	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">chalk	is	carbonate	of	lime). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Constipation. </b>	 Constipation	 is	 very	 common	 among	 women	 in	 the	 non-</p>
<p class="calibre1">pregnant	condition;	but	in	the	pregnant	it	is	much	more	common	and	much	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">aggravated.	Constipation	must	be	guarded	against,	but	the	measures	must	be	of	a</p>

When	the	woman	is	lying	down	the pressure	on	the	bladder	is	relieved,	and	she	does	not	have	to	urinate	frequently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 pressure	 lasts	 only	 the	 first	 two	 or	 three	 months,	 because	 after	 that	 the growing	womb	lifts	itself	out	of	the	pelvis,	rising	into	the	abdominal	cavity;	it	is</p>

<p class="calibre1">heavy	uterus	sinks	again	into	the	pelvic	cavity	and	presses	upon	the	bladder.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">treatment	for	this	frequent	urination	consists	in	wearing	a	well	fitting	abdominal</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>Every	 mother	 should	 nurse	 her	 child—if	 she	 can.	 There	 is	 no	 perfect substitute	for	mother's	milk.	There	is	only	one	excuse	for	a	mother	not	nursing—</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	is	when	she	has	no	milk,	or	when	the	quality	of	the	milk	is	so	poor	that	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">child	does	not	thrive	on	it,	or	when	the	mother	is	run	down,	is	threatened	with	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 suffering	 with	 tuberculosis,	 etc.	 In	 such	 cases	 the	 nursing	 would	 prove</p>
<p class="calibre1">injurious	to	both	mother	and	child. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	mother	cannot	nurse	the	child,	it	should	be	brought	up	artificially	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">modified	 cow's	 milk.	 Formulas	 for	 modified	 milk	 have	 been	 worked	 out	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1">every	 month	 of	 the	 child's	 life,	 and	 if	 the	 formulas	 are	 carefully	 followed,	 and the	 bottle	 and	 nipples	 are	 properly	 sterilized,	 the	 child	 should	 have	 no	 trouble, but	should	thrive	and	grow	like	on	good	mother's	milk.	If	the	child	is	sickly	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">delicate	 and	 does	 not	 thrive	 on	 modified	 cow's	 milk	 or	 on	 the	 other	 artificial foods,	 such	 as	 Horlick's	 malted	 milk,	 or	 Nestlé's	 food,	 then	 a	 wet	 nurse	 may become	necessary.	But	before	engaging	a	wet	nurse	great	care	should	be	taken	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">make	sure	that	she	is	healthy,	that	the	age	of	her	child	is	approximately	the	same</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 the	 age	 of	 the	 child	 which	 she	 is	 about	 to	 nurse,	 and	 particularly	 that	 she	 is free	 from	 any	 syphilitic	 taint.	 One,	 two	 or	 more	 Wassermann	 tests	 should	 be made	to	settle	the	question	definitely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mothers	should	bear	in	mind	that	suckling	the	child	is	good	not	only	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">child,	but	for	the	mother	as	well.	Lactation	helps	the	 <i class="calibre4">involution</i>	of	the	uterus:	the uterus	of	a	nursing	mother	returns	more	quickly	and	more	perfectly	to	its	normal</p>
<p class="calibre1">ante-pregnant	 condition	 than	 the	 uterus	 of	 the	 mother	 who	 cannot	 or	 will	 not nurse	her	child. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	asserted	that	the	reciprocal	affection	between	mother	and	child	is	greater</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	cases	in	which	the	child	suckled	its	mother's	breast.	This	is	quite	likely.	It	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">also	 asserted	 that	 the	 nursing	 mother	 transmits	 certain	 traits	 to	 its	 child,	 which the	 non-nursing	 mother	 cannot.	 This	 is	 merely	 a	 hypothesis	 without	 any</p>
<p class="calibre1">scientific	proof. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 the	 other	 hand,	 the	 statement	 that	 many	 women	 experience	 decidedly</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleasurable	sexual	feelings	while	nursing	seems	to	be	well	substantiated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	the	mother	who	nurses	her	child	should	partake	of	sufficient	nourishment</p>
<p class="calibre1">goes	without	saying.	But	the	advice	often	given	to	nursing	mothers	to	partake	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">beer,	 ale	 or	 wine	 is	 a	 bad	 one.	 It	 is	 a	 question	 if	 a	 mother	 partaking	 of considerable	 quantities	 of	 alcoholic	 beverages	 may	 not	 transmit	 the	 taste	 for alcohol	to	her	children.	No,	alcoholics	should	be	left	alone,	but	milk,	eggs,	meat, </p>
<p class="calibre1">fruit	and	vegetables	should	be	partaken	of	in	abundance. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a><b class="calibre3">Preparing	the	Nipples. </b>	For	the	infant	to	be	able	to	nurse	properly	the	nipples of	the	breast	must	be	in	good	condition.	If	the	nipples	are	sunken,	depressed,	it	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">torture	 for	 the	 child	 to	 nurse.	 It	 uses	 up	 a	 lot	 of	 energy	 uselessly,	 becomes exhausted,	and	gets	very	little	milk;	while	if	the	nipples	be	tender	or	cracked	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">process	of	nursing	is	a	torture	for	the	mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	therefore	necessary	to	attend	to	the	nipples	in	due	time—to	begin	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fifth	 or	 sixth	 month	 is	 not	 too	 early.	 If	 the	 nipples	 are	 sufficiently	 prominent, little	need	be	done	for	them	except	to	wash	them	with	a	little	boric	acid	solution</p>
<p class="calibre1">(one	 teaspoonful	 of	 boric	 acid	 to	 a	 glass	 of	 water)	 occasionally,	 and	 now	 and then	to	rub	in	a	little	petrolatum,	plain	or	borated.	But	if	the	nipples	are	sunken</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	that	they	are	below	the	surface	of	the	breast,	or	if	they	are	only	slightly	above</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	surface	of	the	breast,	they	must	be	treated.	Gentle	traction	must	be	made	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	with	the	fingers	three	or	four	times	a	day.	There	are	only	a	few	cases	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">persistent	 manipulation	 will	 not	 develop	 the	 nipple	 and	 make	 it	 stand	 out</p>
<p class="calibre1">prominently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 the	 nipple	 is	 tender	 it	 should	 be	 washed	 two	 or	 three	 times	 a	 day	 with	 a mixture	 of	 alcohol	 and	 water;	 one	 part	 of	 alcohol	 to	 three	 parts	 of	 water	 is sufficient.	In	washing	the	nipple	with	this	diluted	alcohol	it	should	be	dried	and	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	petrolatum	or	vaseline	rubbed	in.	This	done	two	or	three	times	a	day	during</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 last	 month	 or	 two	 of	 the	 pregnancy	 will	 generally	 produce	 a	 good	 healthy nipple. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The	 Treatment	 of	 Cracked	 Nipples. </b>	 If	 the	 care	 of	 the	 nipple	 has	 been neglected,	 and	 it	 develops	 cracks	 or	 fissures	 so	 that	 the	 nursing	 of	 the	 child causes	 the	 mother	 severe	 pain,	 the	 nursing	 should	 be	 done	 through	 a	 nipple</p>
<p class="calibre1">shield,	 and	 in	 the	 meantime	 between	 the	 nursings	 the	 nipple	 should	 be	 rubbed with	 the	 following	 preparation,	 which	 is	 excellent	 and	 which	 I	 can	 fully</p>
<p class="calibre1">recommend:	thymol	iodide,	½	dram;	olive	oil,	½	ounce.	This	should	be	applied</p>
<p class="calibre1">every	 hour	 to	 the	 nipple	 and	 covered	 with	 a	 little	 cotton;	 before	 each	 nursing, however,	 it	 must	 be	 well	 washed	 off	 with	 warm	 water	 or	 warm	 boric	 acid</p>
<p class="calibre1">solution.	 When	 the	 nipples	 are	 cracked,	 the	 infant's	 lips	 should	 also	 before nursing	 be	 carefully	 wiped	 out	 with	 boric	 acid	 solution.

If	the	cracks	are	excruciatingly	painful,	as	they	sometimes	are,	it	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">necessary	to	give	the	one	breast	a	rest	for	twenty-four	hours	and	have	the	child</p>

<p class="calibre1">trouble,	 while	 the	 second	 procedure,	 the	 pumping,	 does	 exactly	 the	 reverse	 to what	 it	 is	 intended	 to	 do.	 Instead	 of	 drying	 up	 the	 breasts	 it	 keeps	 up	 the secretion.	The	best	thing	to	do	in	a	case	like	that	is	to	leave	the	breasts	alone,	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	pump	them,	but	just	gently	support	them	with	a	bandage	and	then	in	three	or</p>

<p class="calibre1">Abortion—Abortion	an	Evil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	word	abortion,	used	somewhat	loosely,	signifies	the	premature	expulsion</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 fetus;	 the	 expulsion	 of	 the	 fetus	 from	 the	 womb	 before	 it	 is	 viable,	 i.e., before	 it	 is	 capable	 of	 living	 independently.	 Used	 in	 a	 stricter	 sense,	 the	 word abortion	is	applied	to	the	expulsion	of	the	fetus	up	to	the	end	of	the	16th	week; </p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 expulsion	 of	 the	 fetus	 between	 the	 16th	 and	 the	 28th	 week	 the	 term miscarriage	is	applied;	and	when	the	expulsion	of	the	fetus	takes	place	after	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">28th	week,	but	before	full	term,	we	use	the	term	premature	labor.	The	laity	does</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 like	 the	 term	 abortion,	 as	 it	 is	 under	 the	 impression	 that	 the	 term	 always signifies	 criminal	 abortion;	 it	 therefore	 prefers	 to	 use	 the	 term	 miscarriage ("miss"),	regardless	of	the	time	at	which	the	expulsion	of	the	fetus	takes	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 an	 abortion	 (or	 miscarriage)	 takes	 place	 by	 itself,	 without	 any	 outside aid,	we	call	it	 <i class="calibre4">spontaneous	abortion</i>.	When	it	is	brought	on	by	artificial	means, whether	by	the	woman	herself	or	by	somebody	else,	we	call	it	 <i class="calibre4">induced</i>	abortion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	an	abortion	is	induced	for	the	purpose	of	saving	the	woman's	life,	we	call</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 <i class="calibre4">therapeutic</i>	abortion;	this	is	considered	perfectly	legal	and	proper.	But	where an	 abortion	 is	 induced	 merely	 to	 save	 an	 unmarried	 mother's	 reputation,	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1">because	the	married	mother	is	too	poor	or	too	weak	to	have	any	more	children, </p>
<p class="calibre1">or	 is	 reluctant	 to	 have	 any	 (or	 any	 more)	 for	 any	 other	 reason,	 it	 is	 called <i class="calibre4">criminal</i>	 or	  <i class="calibre4">illegal</i>	 abortion,	 and,	 if	 discovered,	 subjects	 the	 mother	 and	 the person	who	produced	the	abortion	to	severe	punishment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 the	 fetus	 for	 some	 reason	 dies	 in	 its	 mother's	 womb,	 it	 is	 generally</p>
<p class="calibre1">expelled	within	a	few	hours	or	days.	Sometimes	this	is	not	the	case,	and	the	dead</p>
<p class="calibre1">fetus	 is	 retained	 for	 several	 weeks,	 or	 months	 or	 even	 years;	 to	 such	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a>phenomenon	we	apply	the	term	 <i class="calibre4">missed</i>	abortion.	Some	women	suffer	from	what might	be	called	the	abortion	habit;	they	can	hardly	ever	carry	a	child	to	full	term, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	lose	it	in	the	same	month	or	even	in	the	same	week	of	gestation	during	each</p>
<p class="calibre1">pregnancy;	 we	 call	 this	 habitual	 abortion.	 And	 this	 habitual	 abortion	 may	 be independent	 of	 disease,	 such,	 for	 instance,	 as	 syphilis.	 The	 terms	  <i class="calibre4">threatened</i>, <i class="calibre4">imminent</i>	and	 <i class="calibre4">inevitable</i>	abortion	require	no	further	explanation. </p>

<p class="calibre1">the	uterus,	the	principal	cause	of	abortion	and	miscarriage	is	syphilis.	And	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 woman	 has	 had	 two	 or	 three	 or	 four	 or	 more	 miscarriages	 in	 succession	 we generally	assume	the	cause	to	be	syphilis,	and	in	most	cases	the	assumption	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	correct. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 an	 abortion	 is	 performed	 by	 an	 experienced	 physician,	 with	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">observance	of	the	utmost	cleanliness	(asepsis	and	antisepsis),	then	the	abortion	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">accompanied	 with	 very	 little	 or	 no	 danger;	 but	 when	 performed	 carelessly,	 by incompetent,	 non-conscientious	 physicians	 and	 midwives,	 the	 operation	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">fraught	with	great	danger	to	the	patient's	health	or	to	her	very	life.	And	abortion</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	a	great	cause	of	premature	death	and	chronic	invalidism	among	women.	And</p>

<p class="calibre1">Change	of	Life	in	Men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 chapter	 on	 menstruation	 I	 referred	 briefly	 to	 the	 menopause.	 I	 will</p>
<p class="calibre1">consider	it	here	somewhat	more	in	detail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	menopause,	also	called	the	climacteric,	and	in	common	language	"change</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	life,"	is	the	period	at	which	woman	ceases	to	menstruate.	The	average	age	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	 this	 occurs	 is	 about	 forty-eight.	 But	 while	 some	 women	 continue	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">menstruate	 up	 to	 the	 age	 of	 fifty,	 fifty-two,	 and	 even	 fifty-five,	 others	 cease	 to menstruate	 at	 the	 age	 of	 forty-five	 or	 even	 forty-two.	 Between	 forty-four	 and fifty-two	are	the	normal	limits.	Anything	before	or	beyond	that	is	exceptional. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	 as	 the	 beginning	 of	 menstruation	 may	 set	 in	 without	 any	 trouble	 of	 any kind,	 and	 just	 as	 some	 women	 have	 not	 the	 slightest	 unpleasant	 symptoms</p>
<p class="calibre1">during	the	entire	period	of	their	menstrual	life,	so	the	menopause	occurs	in	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">women	 without	 any	 trouble,	 physical	 or	 psychic.	 The	 periods	 between	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">menses	 become	 perhaps	 a	 little	 longer,	 or	 a	 little	 irregular,	 the	 menstrual	 flow becomes	 more	 and	 more	 scanty,	 then	 one	 or	 several	 periods	 may	 be	 skipped</p>
<p class="calibre1">altogether,	 and	 the	 menopause	 is	 permanently	 established.	 Many	 women, </p>
<p class="calibre1">however,	the	majority	probably,	suffer	considerably	during	the	transitional	year</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	 years	 of	 the	 menopause.	 Symptoms	 are	 both	 of	 a	 physical	 and	 of	 a	 psychic character,	 but	 the	 psychic	 symptoms	 predominate.	 There	 may	 be	 headache, </p>
<p class="calibre1">capricious	appetite,	or	complete	loss	of	appetite,	considerable	loss	of	flesh,	or	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	contrary	very	sudden	and	rapid	putting	on	of	fat,	great	irritability,	insomnia, </p>
<p class="calibre1">profuse	 perspiration;	 hot	 flashes	 throughout	 the	 body,	 and	 particularly	 in	 the face,	 which	 make	 the	 face	 "blushing"	 and	 congested,	 are	 particularly	 frequent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 the	 woman's	 character	 may	 be	 completely	 changed.	 From	 gentle	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">submissive	she	may	become	pugnacious	and	quarrelsome.	Jealousy	without	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">grounds	for	it	may	be	one	of	the	disagreeable	symptoms,	making	both	the	wife</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	the	husband	very	unhappy.	In	some	exceptional	cases	a	genuine	neurosis	or</p>

<p class="calibre1">symptoms	 of	 the	 menopause	 are	 due,	 not	 to	 the	 menopause	 itself,	 but	 to	 the wrong	 ideas	 about	 this	 period	 that	 have	 prevailed	 for	 so	 many	 centuries.	 We</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a>know	 the	 influence	 of	 the	 mind	 over	 the	 body,	 and	 the	 pernicious	 effect	 which wrong	 ideas	 may	 exercise	 over	 our	 feelings.	 The	 generally	 prevalent	 opinion</p>

<p class="calibre1">unfortunately	of	the	medical	profession	as	well,	is	that	the	menopause	is	the	end</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	woman's	sexual	life.	Every	woman	is	laboring	under	the	erroneous	impression</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	with	the	establishment	of	the	menopause,	with	the	cessation	of	the	menses, </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 ceases	 to	 be	 a	 woman,	 and	 as	 she	 does	 not	 become	 a	 man,	 she	 becomes</p>

<p class="calibre1">after	 the	 menopause	 she	 can	 have	 no	 further	 attraction	 for	 her	 husband	 or	 for other	 men.	 Naturally	 such	 an	 idea	 has	 a	 very	 depressing	 effect	 on	 any	 human being.	 Any	 human	 being	 fights	 to	 the	 last	 to	 retain	 all	 its	 human	 functions, especially	 the	 function	 which	 is	 considered	 as	 important	 as	 is	 the	 sexual</p>

<p class="calibre1">dispelled	 much	 unnecessary	 misery	 will	 be	 the	 lot	 of	 our	 women.

<p class="calibre1">thirty,	if	they	will	learn	that	their	attractiveness	or	non-attractiveness	to	the	male</p>
<p class="calibre1">sex	 does	 not	 depend	 upon	 the	 menopause,	 but	 upon	 their	 general	 condition,	 if they	will	learn	that	many	women	at	fifty	and	sixty	are	much	more	attractive	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	women	at	half	that	age,	they	will	not	take	the	onset	of	the	menopause	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">tragically	 and	 they	 will	 thereby	 avoid	 the	 greater	 part	 of	 their	 mental	 and emotional	suffering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	actual	atrophy	of	the	ovaries,	uterus,	external	genitals	and	the	breasts	can, </p>
<p class="calibre1">of	course,	not	be	prevented,	but	that	atrophy	is	a	slow	and	gradual	process,	and	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 in	 itself	 the	 cause	 of	 the	 various	 distressing	 symptoms	 that	 we	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">enumerated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 treatment	 of	 the	 menopause,	 if	 the	 symptoms	 are	 at	 all	 disagreeable,	 or distressing,	should	be	in	the	hands	of	a	competent	physician.	A	little	wholesome</p>
<p class="calibre1">advice	 may	 be	 more	 efficient	 than	 gallons	 of	 medicine	 and	 bushels	 of	 pills.	 In general	 the	 woman	 should	 try	 to	 lead	 as	 calm	 and	 peaceful	 a	 life	 as	 possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Warm	 baths	 daily	 are	 beneficial,	 constipation	 should	 be	 guarded	 against,	 hot</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Increased	Libido	During	Menopause. </b>	There	is	one	rather	delicate	symptom</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	 I	 must	 not	 pass	 unmentioned.	 Some	 women	 during	 the	 years	 while	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">menopause	 is	 being	 established,	 and	 for	 some	 years	 after	 the	 menopause, </p>
<p class="calibre1">experience	a	greatly	heightened	sexual	desire.	In	some	cases	this	increased	libido</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 normal,	 that	 is,	 no	 other	 pathologic	 symptoms	 or	 local	 conditions	 can	 be discovered.	 In	 some	 cases	 the	 increased	 libido	 is	 distinctly	 due	 to	 local</p>
<p class="calibre1">congestion,	 congestion	 of	 the	 ovaries,	 the	 uterus,	 etc.	 In	 some	 cases,	 I	 can distinctly	testify,	it	is	psychic	or	autosuggestive.	Because	the	woman	thinks,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">believes	that	other	people	think,	that	she	is	soon	going	to	lose	all	her	sexuality, </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	unconsciously	works	herself	up	into	a	sexual	passion	which	sometimes	may</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	of	long	duration	and	may	even	lead	to	disastrous	results. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	to	do	in	such	cases?	Where	the	woman's	libido	is	normal	or	near	normal, </p>
<p class="calibre1">then	 naturally	 it	 should	 be	 normally	 gratified.	 But	 if	 the	 libido	 seems	 to	 be abnormally	strong	and	the	demands	for	sexual	gratification	are	too	frequent,	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	woman	should	be	treated	and	sexual	gratification	should	not	be	indulged	in, </p>
<p class="calibre1">because	 in	 such	 cases,	 as	 a	 rule,	 sexual	 gratification	 only	 adds	 fuel	 to	 the	 fire, and	the	woman's	demands	may	become	more	and	more	frequent,	more	and	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">insistent.	In	exceptional	cases	it	may	even	reach	the	intensity	of	nymphomania. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"sinfulness"	 of	 the	 habit,	 as	 well	 as	 its	 injuriousness,	 they	 begin	 to	 scold	 the child,	to	frighten	it,	to	make	it	believe	that	it	is	doing	something	terrible,	that	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">has	 disgraced	 them	 and	 itself;	 and	 they	 try	 to	 persuade	 it	 that,	 unless	 it	 stops immediately,	 the	 most	 direful	 consequences	 are	 awaiting	 it.	 The	 results	 of	 this mode	of	procedure	are	disastrous—much	more	so	than	is	the	masturbation	itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Often	the	scolding	and	the	exposure	of	the	child	are	done	in	the	presence	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">others.	This	implants	in	the	poor	girl	a	sullen	resentment	that	only	makes	it	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">difficult	for	it	to	break	the	habit.	When	the	child	is	brought	to	the	physician,	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	see	by	its	behavior,	by	its	downcast	looks,	by	its	sulkiness,	by	its	attempt	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">refrain	 from	 tears,	 and	 other	 signs,	 that	 it	 regards	 the	 physician	 in	 exactly	 the same	 light	 as	 a	 youthful	 criminal	 regards	 the	 judge	 before	 whom	 he	 has	 been brought	for	trial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 is	 time,	 high	 time,	 that	 this	 silly	 and	 injurious	 attitude	 toward	 a	 practice, which	 is	 very	 common,	 be	 radically	 changed.	 It	 is	 time	 that	 parents	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">physicians	 learn	 that	 the	 injuriousness	 of	 the	 habit	 has	 been	 greatly,	 grossly exaggerated.	It	is	time	that	they	know	that	the	vast	majority	of	boys	and	girls	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	 the	 habit	 without	 being	 much,	 or	 any,	 the	 worse	 for	 it.	 The	 knowledge	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a>this	 fact	 will	 not	 only	 save	 them	 and	 the	 children	 much	 needless	 anguish	 and suffering,	 but	 will	 make	 it	 much	 easier	 to	 deal	 with	 the	 latter,	 make	 it	 much easier	to	get	them	divorced	from	the	habit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	we	look	at	the	matter	in	a	sensible,	common-sense	way,	and	do	not	tell	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">child	caught	in	the	practice	that	it	has	done	something	disgracefully	vicious	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">criminal,	 but	 speak	 to	 it	 kindly	 and	 tell	 it	 that	 it	 is	 doing	 something	 that	 may injure	it	greatly,	that	may	interfere	with	its	future	mental	and	physical	health	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">development,	 then	 we	 shall	 have	 far	 greater	 success	 in	 our	 endeavors	 to	 break the	boy	or	the	girl	of	the	habit	of	masturbation.	As	I	have	said	in	another	place:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"In	 my	 opinion,	 stigmatizing	 even	 the	 most	 moderate	 indulgence	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">masturbation	as	a	vice	has	a	deleterious	effect	upon	the	people	who	so	indulge</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	makes	it	harder	for	them	to	break	off	the	habit.	Every	thinking	physician	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sexologist	 can	 tell	 you	 that	 picturing	 the	 masturbatory	 habit	 in	 too	 lurid	 colors and	stigmatizing	it	with	too	strong	epithets	has,	as	a	rule,	the	contrary	effect	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 one	 expected.	 The	 victims	 of	 the	 habit	 consider	 themselves	 degraded, </p>
<p class="calibre1">irretrievably	lost.	They	lose	their	self-respect,	and	it	is,	on	account	of	that,	harder for	them	to	break	themselves	of	the	habit." </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	shall	accomplish	a	good	deal	more	with	our	youthful	and	older	patients	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	leave	alone,	altogether,	the	moral	side	of	the	question—if	there	be	any	moral</p>
<p class="calibre1">side	 to	 it—and	 emphasize	 the	 physical	 injuriousness	 of	 the	 habit.	 We	 do	 not want	 to	 diminish	 the	 self-respect	 of	 our	 boys	 and	 girls,	 we	 want	 to	 increase	 it; and	we	can	not	do	this	if	we	make	them	believe	that	a	masturbator	is	a	vicious</p>
<p class="calibre1">criminal.	Inspire	your	patients	with	confidence,	tell	them	that	indulgence	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">habit	jeopardizes	their	future	growth,	both	physical	and	mental,	their	health	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">happiness,	and	you	will	find	them	easier	to	control. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 am	 not	 trying	 to	 minimize	 the	 danger	 of	 masturbation,	 for,	 if	 indulged	 in from	an	early	age	and	to	great	excess,	the	results	 <i class="calibre4">may</i>	be	disastrous.	But,	even	if I	 were	 to	 minimize	 the	 evil	 consequences,	 that	 would	 be	 less	 of	 a	 sin	 than	 to exaggerate	them	the	way	it	has	been	done	for	so	many	years,	by	so	many	people</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	profession	and	out	of	it.	The	evil	results	of	exaggerating	the	influence	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">masturbation	 have	 been	 so	 great	 in	 the	 past	 that,	 if	 now	 the	 pendulum	 were	 to swing	to	the	other	extreme,	I	am	sure	it	would	not	be	a	bad	thing	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	deal	with	the	subject	of	the	 <i class="calibre4">treatment</i>	of	masturbation	belongs	to	a	medical</p>

<p class="calibre1">of	masturbation	will	not	be	out	of	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Prevention	 of	 the	 Habit	 of	 Masturbation. </b>	 The	 keynote	 of	 preventing	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a>habit	is,	carefully	to	watch	the	child	from	its	earliest	infancy.	We	know	that	not infrequently	 stupid	 or	 vicious	 nursemaids,	 wet-nurses,	 and	 even	 governesses</p>
<p class="calibre1">ignorantly	or	deliberately	induce	the	habit	in	children	under	their	charge.	This,	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">course,	 must	 be	 prevented.	 Even	 children	 of	 the	 age	 of	 nine,	 ten,	 eleven	 years should	not	be	left	alone,	but	always	be	under	supervision.	Too	close	friendship</p>
<p class="calibre1">between	boys	or	girls,	particularly	of	different	ages,	should	be	looked	upon	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">suspicion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	number	of	girls	never	should	sleep	in	the	same	room	without	supervision	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	older	person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sleeping	together	of	two	in	the	same	bed,	whether	it	be	two	children	or	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">grown	 person	 and	 a	 child,	 should	 not	 be	 permitted	 under	 any	 circumstances.	 I admit	of	no	exceptions	to	this	demand.	It	makes	no	difference	whether	the	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">person	is	a	mother,	a	father,	a	brother	or	a	sister.	Leaving	out	of	the	question	any</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">deliberate</i>	 element,	 the	 thing	 is	 dangerous;	 for,	 very	 often,	 unintentionally, unwittingly,	masturbation	is	initiated	by	this	intimate	contact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 child—boy	 or	 girl—should	 sleep	 alone,	 on	 a	 rather	 hard	 mattress.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">covering	should	be	light.	A	coverlet	may	be	put	over	the	feet.	The	child	always</p>
<p class="calibre1">should	sleep	with	the	arms	out	upon	the	cover	or	blanket,	never	 <i class="calibre4">under</i>	the	same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 this	 is	 done	 from	 childhood	 on,	 it	 is	 very	 easy	 to	 get	 used	 to	 this	 way	 of sleeping,	 and	 many	 a	 case	 of	 masturbation	 will	 thus	 be	 obviated.	 The	 child</p>
<p class="calibre1">should	not	be	permitted	to	loll	in	bed:	it	must	be	taught	to	get	up	as	soon	as	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">awakes	 in	 the	 morning.	 The	 general	 bringing-up	 must	 be	 of	 a	 strengthening, </p>
<p class="calibre1">hardening	 character;	 and	 this	 applies	 both	 to	 the	 body	 and	 the	 will.	 When	 the children	reach	the	age	of	nine,	ten,	eleven,	twelve	or	thirteen	years	(we	must	use</p>
<p class="calibre1">discrimination	and	judgment,	for,	some	children	of	nine	are	as	developed	as	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">others	of	thirteen),	we	must	tell	them	that	it	is	bad	and	injurious	to	handle	one's</p>
<p class="calibre1">genitals,	 and	 we	 must	 warn	 them	 to	 shun	 any	 companions	 who	 wish	 to	 initiate them	 into	 any	 manipulations	 of	 these	 parts	 or	 who	 show	 an	 inclination	 to	 talk about	the	sexual	organs	and	sex	matters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hot	 baths	 are	 very	 injurious	 for	 young	 children	 in	 their	 influence	 in	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1">direction.	 There	 is	 no	 question	 that	 a	 hot	 bath	 has	 a	 very	 decided	 stimulating effect	 upon	 the	 sexual	 desire	 of	 adults	 as	 well	 as	 of	 children,	 both	 male	 and female;	 in	 fact,	 I	 have	 had	 several	 patients	 of	 either	 sex	 tell	 me	 that	 their	 first masturbatory	 act	 was	 committed	 while	 they	 were	 in	 a	 hot	 bath.	 Of	 course,	 the sensation	having	been	pleasurable,	they	kept	on	repeating	the	experience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every	 factor	 liable	 to	 give	 rise	 to	 the	 habit	 should	 be	 removed.	 Thus,	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a>instance,	eczema	about	the	genitals,	strongly	acid	urine,	seatworms,	and	the	like, should	 be	 treated	 until	 cured.	 That	 anything	 having	 a	 tendency	 prematurely	 to awaken	the	sexual	instinct	should	be	rigorously	avoided,	goes	without	saying. </p>

<p class="calibre1">—Causes	 of	 Leucorrhea—Tonic	 Medicines—Local</p>
<p class="calibre1">Treatment—Formulæ	for	Douching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leucorrhea	 means	 literally	 a	 "white	 running,"	 and	 is	 applied	 by	 the	 laity	 to any	 whitish	 discharge	 coming	 from	 the	 vagina.	 This	 is	 wrong,	 because	 some</p>
<p class="calibre1">white	 discharges	 may	 be	 of	 little	 importance;	 others	 may	 be	 of	 a	 serious</p>
<p class="calibre1">character,	and	not	be	leucorrhea	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leucorrhea	 is	 one	 of	 the	 banes	 of	 the	 modern	 girl	 and	 woman.	 It	 is	 very</p>
<p class="calibre1">frequent.	Probably	at	least	twenty-five	per	cent,	(some	say	fifty	or	seventy-five</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a>per	cent.)	of	all	women	suffer	with	it	in	a	greater	or	lesser	degree.	In	some	cases it	 is	 only	 an	 annoyance,	 necessitating	 the	 frequent	 changing	 of	 napkins,	 but	 in others	 it	 causes	 a	 great	 deal	 of	 weakness,	 backache,	 erosions,	 itching	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">burning.	It	is	very	resistant	to	treatment,	particularly	in	girls.	The	reason	it	is	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">resistant	 to	 treatment	 is	 because	 the	 discharge,	 while	 coming	 from	 the	 vagina, <i class="calibre4">does	not	usually	originate</i>	in	the	vagina;	it	originates	in	the	neck	of	the	womb, and	the	hundreds	and	hundreds	of	injections	that	women	take	for	their	leucorrhea</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	 reach	 the	 vagina;	 they	 cannot	 penetrate	 into	 the	 womb.	 And	 it	 is	 only	 by treating	the	cavity	of	the	cervix,	which	can	only	be	done	by	a	physician,	through</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 speculum,	 that	 the	 root	 of	 the	 trouble	 can	 be	 reached.	 And,	 if	 any	 erosion	 or ulcer	 is	 noticed,	 it	 can	 be	 directly	 touched	 up	 with	 the	 necessary	 application. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	it	is	for	this	reason	that	in	girls	leucorrhea	is	so	much	more	difficult	to	treat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	fear	of	having	the	hymen	ruptured	the	girl	objects	to	a	thorough	examination</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	to	local	treatment,	and	the	leucorrhea	is	permitted	to	proceed	until	perhaps	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">chronic	inflammation	of	the	womb	and	the	Fallopian	tubes	is	established.	There</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 no	 doubt	 that	 many	 cases	 of	 sterility	 or	 childlessness	 in	 women	 are	 due	 to long-neglected	leucorrhea	in	girlhood. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">What	 Is	 the	 Cause	 of	 Leucorrhea? </b>	 We	 can	 answer	 simply:	 the	 cause	 of leucorrhea	 is	 catarrh	 in	 any	 part	 of	 the	 female	 genital	 tract.	 But	 this	 is	 no	 real answer.	What	are	the	causes	of	the	catarrh?	The	causes	of	catarrh	are	many:	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">most	 common	 cause	 is	 a	 cold.	 Wetting	 the	 feet	 and	 getting	 chilled,	 particularly during	 the	 menses,	 may	 set	 up	 a	 catarrh	 in	 the	 cervix.	 Long	 standing	 on	 one's feet,	lifting	and	 carrying	 heavy	 bundles,	 dancing	 in	 overheated	 rooms	 and	 then going	 out	 scantily	 clad	 in	 the	 chill	 night	 air,	 prolonged	 ungratified	 sexual excitement,	 lack	 of	 cleanliness	 in	 the	 external	 genitals—all	 these	 are	 factors	 in setting	up	a	catarrh	of	the	cervix	with	a	resultant	leucorrhea.	A	general	rundown</p>
<p class="calibre1">condition,	 worry,	 overwork,	 too	 hard	 study,	 lack	 of	 fresh	 air,	 and	 a	 general scrofulous	 condition	 also	 favor	 the	 development	 of	 catarrh	 of	 the	 womb	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">leucorrhea.	 It	 will	 therefore	 be	 seen	 that	 the	 treatment	 of	 leucorrhea	 to	 be successful	must	be	general	and	local. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">General	 Treatment. </b>	 The	 general	 treatment	 consists	 in	 general	 hygienic</p>
<p class="calibre1">measures	and	in	common	sense.	The	patient	should	not	be	on	her	feet	more	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	can	help,	and	she	should	not	walk	until	exhausted	or	fatigued.	It	is	better	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">take	 several	 short	 walks	 than	 one	 long	 one.	 The	 corset	 she	 wears,	 if	 she	 wears any	at	all,	should	be	of	the	modern	kind:	not	one	that	presses	the	womb	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">other	 abdominal	 organs	 down,	 but	 one	 that	 supports	 the	 abdominal	 walls,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather	 raises	 the	 abdominal	 organs	 up.	 The	 lacing	 or	 buttoning	 must	 be	 from below	up,	and	not	from	above	down.	That	it	should	not	in	any	way	interfere	with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a>the	freedom	of	respiration	goes	without	saying.	Constipation	if	any,	to	be	treated, must	be	treated	intelligently,	by	mild	measures	(see	<a href="#p60">Constipation, </a>	in	the	chapter on	 pregnancy),	 and	 care	 must	 be	 taken	 that	 the	 bowels	 move	 at	 regular	 hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where	the	leucorrhea	is	due	to	or	is	aggravated	by	anemia	and	general	weakness, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a	good	iron	preparation,	such	as	one	Blaud's	five-grain	pill	three	times	a	day,	or	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">tonic	 of	 iron,	 quinine	 and	 strychnine,	 will	 do	 good.	 A	 daily	 cold	 bath	 or	 cold sponge,	followed	by	a	brisk	dry	rubbing	with	a	rough	towel,	is	also	useful. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Local	Treatment. </b>	Local	measures	consist	of	painting	or	swabbing	the	vagina</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	cervix	with	various	solutions,	of	tampons,	suppositories	and	douches.	Local</p>
<p class="calibre1">application	to	the	vagina	and	uterus	can	be	done	satisfactorily	by	the	physician</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	nurse	only.	The	insertion	of	a	suppository	or	douching	can	be	easily	done	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	patient	herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	 it	 is	 always	 best	 and	 safest	 to	 consult	 a	 physician,	 and,	 while	 self-medication	is	generally	inadvisable,	there	are	occasions	when	a	physician	is	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">available;	in	some	small	places	a	woman	may,  <i class="calibre4">for	various	reasons</i>,	have	a	strong objection	to	gynecological	examination	and	treatment;	and	some	women	may	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">too	poor	to	pay	the	doctor.	In	such	circumstances	self-treatment	is	justified	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	 can	 be	 no	 objection	 to	 it	 if	 the	 remedies	 are	 harmless	 and	 are	 sure	 to	 do some	good;	that	is,	to	improve	the	condition	where	they	do	not	effect	a	complete</p>
<p class="calibre1">cure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	simplest	things	is	an	alum	tampon.	You	take	a	piece	of	absorbent</p>
<p class="calibre1">cotton,	 about	 the	 size	 of	 a	 fist,	 spread	 it	 out,	 put	 about	 a	 tablespoonful	 of powdered	 alum	 on	 it,	 fold	 it	 up,	 tie	 a	 string	 around	 the	 center,	 insert	 it	 in	 the vagina	 as	 far	 as	 it	 will	 go,	 and	 leave	 it	 in	 for	 twenty-four	 hours.	 Then	 pull	 it gently	 by	 the	 string	 and	 syringe	 yourself	 with	 a	 quart	 or	 two	 quarts	 of	 warm water.	Such	a	tampon	may	be	inserted	every	other	day	or	every	third	day,	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 known	 many	 cases	 where	 this	 simple	 treatment	 alone	 produced	 a	 cure.	 In some	cases,	however,	douches	work	better	and	the	two	best	things	for	douching</p>
<p class="calibre1">are:	tincture	of	iodine	and	lactic	acid.	Buy,	say,	four	ounces	of	tincture	of	iodine, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 use	 two	 teaspoonfuls	 in	 two	 quarts	 of	 hot	 water	 in	 a	 douche	 bag.	 This injection	should	be	used	twice	a	day,	morning	and	night.	Of	the	lactic	acid	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">buy,	 say,	 a	 pint,	 and	 use	 two	 tablespoonfuls	 to	 two	 quarts	 of	 water.	 The	 lactic acid	 has	 the	 advantage	 over	 the	 tincture	 of	 iodine	 that	 it	 is	 colorless,	 while	 the iodine	 is	 dark	 and	 stains	 whatever	 it	 comes	 in	 contact	 with.	 Sometimes	 I	 order the	use	of	the	tincture	of	iodine	and	the	lactic	acid	alternately:	for	one	douche	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tincture	 of	 iodine,	 for	 the	 next	 the	 lactic	 acid,	 and	 so	 on.	 When	 the	 condition improves,	it	is	sufficient	to	use	one	teaspoonful	of	the	tincture	of	iodine	and	one</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>tablespoonful	of	the	lactic	acid	to	two	quarts	of	water.	These	injections	are	quite efficient	and	have	the	advantage	of	being	perfectly	harmless.	One	point	about	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">injections:	 they	 should	 be	 taken	 not	 in	 the	 standing	 or	 squatting	 position	 (in which	position	the	fluid	comes	right	out),	but	while	lying	down,	over	a	douche</p>
<p class="calibre1">pan.	 The	 douche	 bag	 should	 be	 only	 about	 a	 foot	 above	 the	 bed,	 so	 that	 the irrigating	fluid	may	come	out	slowly;	the	patient,	after	each	injection	taken	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">daytime,	should	remain	at	least	half	an	hour	in	bed	(in	the	night	time	she	stays</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	night	in	bed).	This	gives	the	injection	a	better	chance	to	come	in	contact	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	the	parts	of	the	vagina,	and	a	portion	of	it	comes	in	contact	with	the	cervix, </p>

<p class="calibre1">—lay	 people	 don't	 usually	 now	 and	 they	 surely	 didn't	 then	 purchase	 and	 read strictly	medical	works—where	could	they	obtain	the	information?	The	result	was</p>

<p class="calibre1">prevalence	of	the	disease	in	the	male	sex,	with	its	consequent	disastrous	effects</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	married	women.	A	statement	made	by	a	Dr.	Noeggerath	(a	German	physician</p>

<p class="calibre1">uncured	 and	 infect	 or	 are	 apt	 to	 infect	 their	 wives,	 has	 been	 shown	 to	 be	 a ridiculously	 absurd	 exaggeration.	 If	 it	 had	 been	 true,	 the	 race	 would	 now	 be	 at the	point	of	dying	out.	Nevertheless,	this	statement	is	copied	from	book	to	book, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>as	if	it	were	gospel	truth,	as	if	it	were	a	scientifically	and	statistically	established fact	instead	of	a	wild,	sensational	guess.	An	esteemed	New	York	physician,	Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prince	A.	Morrow,	did	excellent	pioneer	work	in	calling	attention	to	the	dangers</p>

<p class="calibre1">caused	and	are	still	causing	the	judicious	to	grieve.	The	statement,	for	instance, </p>
<p class="calibre1">that	there	is	more	venereal	disease	among	innocent,	virtuous	wives	than	among</p>
<p class="calibre1">prostitutes	is	one	to	cause	the	real	honest	investigator	to	weep	(over	the	human</p>

<p class="calibre1">ridiculousness	 of	 this	 statement	 becomes	 especially	 evident	 when	 we	 recollect</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 the	 same	 gentleman	 made	 the	 statement	 that	 every	 prostitute,	 without</p>
<p class="calibre1">exception,	was	diseased	at	one	time	or	another.	If	venereal	disease	exists	among</p>
<p class="calibre1">prostitutes	to	the	extent	of	100	per	cent.,	then	how	can	it	exist	to	a	greater	extent</p>
<p class="calibre1">among	innocent,	virtuous	wives?	And	to	still	further	emphasize	the	absurdity	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 above	 statement,	 I	 will	 tell	 you	 that	 the	 extent	 of	 venereal	 disease	 among married	 women	 is	 believed	 by	 careful	 non-sensational	 venereologists	 not	 to</p>

<p class="calibre1">Yes,	 the	 silence	 of	 former	 years	 has	 given	 place	 to	 the	 lurid	 exaggeration	 of the	 present	 day.	 While	 on	 the	 whole	 the	 former	 was	 worse	 than	 the	 latter,	 the latter	is	bad	enough,	because	it	makes	many	girls	unhappy,	sowing	in	them	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">disease	has	had	on	them.	She	states	in	her	conclusions	that	"the	histories	reveal	a large	 percentage	 of	 harmful	 results,	 such	 as	 conditions	 bordering	 upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">neurasthenia,	melancholia,	pessimism	and	 <i class="calibre4">sex	antagonism</i>	(italics	mine),	directly traceable	 to	 this	 knowledge.	 Eleven	 of	 the	 girls	 interviewed	 developed	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">pronounced	 repulsion	 for	 men,	 although	 prior	 to	 their	 'knowledge'	 they	 had</p>

<p class="calibre1">declared	 that	 they	 have	 totally	 lost	 faith	 in	 the	 moral	 cleanness	 of	 men.	 Eight have	already	refused	to	marry,	or	intend	to	do	so,	because	of	their	belief	that	the</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a>they	 say	 they	 would	 be	 glad	 to	 marry.	 All	 of	 these	 say	 their	 decision	 has rendered	them	more	or	less	unhappy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	laudable	desire	to	keep	our	young	women	pure	and	to	protect	them	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">infection,	 in	 the	 endeavor	 to	 make	 them	 demand	 one	 moral	 standard	 for	 both</p>
<p class="calibre1">sexes,	 our	 exaggerating	 reformers	 are	 condemning	 them	 to	 lifelong	 celibacy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which	 in	 the	 case	 of	 women	 often	 means	 lifelong	 neurasthenia	 and</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The	Truth	of	the	Matter. </b>	Here	is	the	Truth	about	venereal	disease—the	truth</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	I	know	it,	without	concealment	on	the	one	hand	and	without	exaggeration	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 other.	 Exact	 figures	 are,	 of	 course,	 unobtainable	 anywhere;	 but	 results</p>
<p class="calibre1">obtained	 from	 unbiased	 investigations	 of	  <i class="calibre4">different</i>	 classes	 of	 society,	 from hospital	 reports,	 from	 questionnaires	 among	 students,	 etc.,	 tell	 us	 that	 probably about	twenty	per	cent.	of	the	adult	male	population	are	the	victims	of	gonorrhea</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	one	time	or	another;	that	probably	eight	or	ten	per	cent.	are	not	entirely	cured</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	they	enter	matrimony;	and	four	or	five	per	cent.	(some	would	say	two	per</p>
<p class="calibre1">cent.)	of	wives	become	infected	with	gonorrhea.	This,	I	say,	is	terrible	enough, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	makes	the	greatest	care	and	caution	imperative;	for,	if	you	should	be	one	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	victims	of	the	two	or	five	per	cent.,	it	would	be	little	consolation	to	you	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	other	ninety-eight	or	ninety-five	per	cent.	of	wives	have	escaped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	 course	 the	 percentage	 of	 venereal	 disease	 among	 young	 men,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">afterwards	 among	 their	 wives,	 will	 vary	 greatly	 with	 the	 stratum	 of	 society. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among	the	"lower"	strata	you	may	find	fifty	per	cent.	of	infection,	with	a	very large	percentage	of	those	uncured.	Not	because	they	are	of	a	lower	morality	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	higher	classes,	but	because	the	cheap	class	of	prostitutes	that	they	are	obliged</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 patronize	 are	 frequently	 diseased	 and	 because	 they	 cannot	 afford	 expert</p>
<p class="calibre1">treatment,	or	any	treatment	at	all.	Among	these	classes	you	will	naturally	find	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	 larger	 percentage	 of	 diseased	 wives.	 But	 then	 to	 counteract	 this	 we	 must bear	in	mind	that	there	are	large	classes	of	men	in	whom	gonorrhea	exists	only	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 extent	 of	 five	 or	 ten	 per	 cent.,	 and	 we	 have	 large	 classes	 of	 wives	 among whom	the	victims	of	gonorrhea	will	come	up	only	to	a	fraction	of	one	per	cent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	above	figures,	you	see,	differ	materially	from	the	statements	found	in	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">many	 sex	 books	 that	 "80	 per	 cent.	 of	 all	 married	 men	 in	 New	 York	 have gonorrhea,"	 and	 that	 "at	 least	 three	 out	 of	 every	 five	 [60	 per	 cent.!]	 married women	 in	 New	 York	 have	 gonorrhea."	 Whenever	 you	 read	 or	 hear	 such	 a</p>

<p class="calibre1">Gonorrheal	Germs</p>
<p class="calibre1">GONORRHEAL	GERMS. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Gonorrhea</b>	 is	 an	 inflammation	 caused	 by	 a	 germ	 called	 the	 gonococcus, </p>
<p class="calibre1">discovered	 by	 Dr.	 A.	 Neisser,	 of	 Breslau,	 Germany,	 in	 1879.	 Any	 mucous</p>
<p class="calibre1">membrane	may	be	the	seat	of	gonorrhea,	but	it	attacks	by	preference	the	mucous</p>
<p class="calibre1">membrane	 of	 the	 genital	 organs,	 and	 of	 one	 other	 organ—the	 eye.	 Its	 principal symptoms	are:	inflammation,	pain,	burning	and	discharge.	In	men,	it	attacks	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">urethra;	in	women	it	attacks	the	cervix—the	neck	of	the	womb—the	urethra,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 vulva.	 The	 vagina	 is	 seldom	 attacked	 in	 adult	 women,	 because	 the	 mucous membrane	of	the	adult	vagina	is	rather	tough	and	does	not	offer	a	good	soil	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	development	of	the	gonococcus	germ.	The	discharge	that	a	woman	has	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	has	gonorrhea	comes	principally	or	exclusively	from	the	neck	of	the	womb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	little	girls,	however,	in	whom	the	lining	of	the	vagina	is	tender,	gonorrhea	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	vagina	and	the	vulva	is	common.	(See	chapter<a href="#p95">	Vulvovaginitis	in	Little	Girls.)</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Gonorrhea	is	a	local	disease.	While	in	some	cases,	after	the	disease	has	lasted	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	 time,	 a	 certain	 poison	 is	 generated	 by	 the	 germs	 which	 circulates	 in	 the blood,	and	while	the	germs	may	occasionally	wander	into	distant	organs,	still	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">98	per	cent.	of	all	cases	gonorrhea	is	a	local	disease,	and	if	taken	in	time	is	cured</p>
<p class="calibre1">without	leaving	any	traces	on	the	general	organism. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Gonorrhea	 Not	 Hereditary. </b>	 Then,	 gonorrhea	 is	 not	 a	 hereditary	 disease. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nobody	 ever	  <i class="calibre4">inherits</i>	 gonorrhea.	 A	 child	 may	 be	 born	 with	 a	 gonorrheal inflammation	of	the	eyes	(ophthalmia	neonatorum),	but	this	inflammation	is	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">inherited;	it	can	only	be	acquired	if	the	mother	is	suffering	with	gonorrhea	while</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	child	is	being	born:	some	of	the	pus	in	the	mother's	birth	canal	gets	into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">child's	eyes	while	it	passes	through	the	uterus	and	vagina.	This	is	not	heredity; </p>
<p class="calibre1">this	is	simple	infection,	and	can	be	avoided	by	keeping	the	mother's	birth	canal</p>
<p class="calibre1">clean	 by	 antiseptic	 douches	 before	 childbirth.	 In	 short,	 I	 repeat	 gonorrhea	 is essentially	a	local	and	not	a	constitutional	disease,	and	is	not	hereditary.	In	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">two	 respects	 it	 differs	 from	 syphilis,	 which	 is	 the	 most	 constitutional	 and	 most hereditary	of	all	diseases. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Course	 of	 Gonorrhea	 in	 Men	 and	 Women. </b>	 Gonorrhea	 runs	 an	 entirely</p>
<p class="calibre1">different	 course	 in	 women	 than	 it	 does	 in	 men.	 When	 a	 man	 has	 gonorrhea	 he knows	 it	 immediately;	 first,	 because	 the	 discharge	 tells	 him	 that	 there	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	 the	 matter	 with	 him,	 for	 a	 man	 is	 not	 used	 to	 having	 any	 discharge</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a>from	the	urethra	unless	there	is	something	the	matter	with	him.	Second,	the	urine becomes	at	once	burning	and	painful.	In	women	the	urethra	is	a	separate	canal</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	vagina,	and	the	urethra	is	very	frequently	not	affected	in	gonorrhea.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">infection	generally	starts	in	the	cervix,	and	the	disease	may	last	for	considerable</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	 before	 the	 woman	 becomes	 aware	 of	 it.	 In	 general,	 gonorrhea	 is	 a	 less painful	 disease	 in	 woman,	 and	 this	 is	 a	 bad	 thing,	 because	 she	 thus	 neglects treatment	and	loses	valuable	time,	permitting	the	disease	to	develop.	Even	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 urethra	 is	 affected	 in	 women,	 it	 does	 not	 give	 as	 severe	 symptoms	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">inflammation	of	the	urethra	in	men.	If	the	woman	does	have	pains	she	often	pays</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	attention	to	them,	because	woman	is	used	to	pains;	as	we	have	seen	before, </p>
<p class="calibre1">fifty	 per	 cent.	 of	 all	 women	 suffer	 more	 or	 less	 with	 dysmenorrhea.	 Many	 of them	 have	 a	 leucorrheal	 discharge	 of	 greater	 or	 lesser	 degree,	 and	 therefore	 if there	is	an	increase	in	the	pains,	or	an	increase	in	the	discharge,	little	attention	is paid	to	the	matter.	In	fact,	a	woman	may	have	a	chronic	gonorrhea	for	months	or</p>

<p class="calibre1">increase	 in	 the	 amount	 of	 the	 discharge,	 or	 change	 in	 color,	 particularly	 if	 it becomes	 greenish,	 or	 if	 the	 odor	 becomes	 offensive,	 or	 if	 there	 is	 chafing, burning,	or	irritation	around	the	genitals,	and	particularly	if	there	is	an	increase</p>

<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 cervix,	 and	 not,	 as	 is	 now	 often	 the	 case,	 after	 the	 inflammation	 has extended	into	the	uterus	and	Fallopian	tubes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Self-treatment. </b>	 I	 do	 not	 believe	 in	 self-treatment	 because	 it	 is	 generally unsatisfactory	 and	 may	 often	 even	 become	 dangerous,	 and	 I	 decidedly	 advise</p>
<p class="calibre1">every	woman	who	suspects	that	she	has	contracted	gonorrhea	to	apply	at	once	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 competent	 physician.	 But	 it	 happens	 not	 infrequently	 that	 a	 woman	 is	 so</p>
<p class="calibre1">situated	that	she	cannot	consult	a	physician.	And	in	the	meantime	there	is	danger</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 gonorrhea	 spreading	 further	 and	 further.	 In	 such	 cases	 it	 is	 advisable	 for the	woman	to	use	an	injection	until	such	time	when	she	can	consult	a	physician. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	injection	I	am	going	to	advise	may	in	itself	produce	a	cure;	and,	if	it	does</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	produce	a	complete	cure,	it	at	any	rate	improves	the	condition,	prevents	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">extension	 of	 the	 disease,	 makes	 subsequent	 treatment	 easier,	 and	 besides	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">perfectly	 harmless.	 The	 best	 injection	 for	 self	 use	 in	 gonorrhea	 is	 tincture	 of iodine;	the	proportion	is	two	teaspoonfuls	to	a	quart	or	two	quarts	of	water.	If	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a>case	is	very	bad,	such	an	injection	may	be	taken	twice	a	day.	If	the	case	is	not very	bad,	once	a	day	is	sufficient.	After	using	the	tincture	of	iodine	for	five	days</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	a	week,	it	is	good	to	change	off	to	lactic	acid.	Buy	a	pint	or	so	of	lactic	acid	in</p>

<p class="calibre1">The	mucous	membrane,	or	the	lining	of	the	vulva	and	vagina,	in	little	girls	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	 tender,	 and	 therefore	 very	 readily	 subject	 to	 infection.	 An	 infection	 of	 the vulva	and	vagina	due	to	the	gonococcus	or	to	some	other	germ	is	very	common</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 little	 girls.	 At	 least	 it	 used	 to	 be,	 particularly	 among	 children	 of	 the	 poor,	 in institutions	 and	 hospitals.	 The	 very	 dangerous	 infective	 character	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">vulvovaginitis	was	not	known,	and	the	infection	was	therefore	easily	transferred</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	towels,	linen,	toilet	seats,	bedpans,	syringe	nozzles,	thermometers,	the	nurses' </p>
<p class="calibre1">hands,	 and	 in	 various	 other	 ways.	 Now	 great	 care	 is	 being	 taken	 and	 in	 most hospitals	 no	 children	 are	 admitted	 in	 the	 general	 wards	 unless	 it	 is	 determined that	they	are	free	from	vulvovaginitis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Generally	speaking,	vulvovaginitis	in	children	is	a	mild	infection.	A	child	may</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 it	 for	 several	 weeks	 or	 months	 without	 being	 aware	 of	 it,	 without	 saying anything	about	it,	the	diagnosis	often	being	made	by	the	mother,	who	begins	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">notice	 the	 creamy	 discharge	 on	 the	 girl's	 linen	 or	 underwear.	 And	 this	 is	 the principal	 symptom	 in	 little	 girls	 thus	 afflicted—the	 discharge.	 This	 discharge may	be	very	profuse,	covering	the	vulva,	vagina,	and	cervix. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 severe	 cases,	 there	 is	 also	 an	 infection	 of	 the	 urethra,	 and	 the	 child	 may complain	 of	 burning	 at	 urination,	 itching	 and	 pain	 around	 the	 vulva	 and	 anus, and	slight	pain	in	the	abdomen.	There	may	be	a	moderate	rise	in	temperature,	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	101	deg.	F.,	and	in	some	instances	the	attack	is	sufficiently	acute	to	give	rise</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	a	chill	and	fever.	A	mild	inflammation	of	the	joints	may	set	in	within	the	first</p>
<p class="calibre1">weeks	of	the	infection,	although	as	a	usual	thing	it	comes	later	on. </p>

<p class="calibre1">nevertheless	 has	 a	 very	 bad	 effect	 on	 the	 child	 who	 is	 unfortunate	 enough	 to become	 a	 victim	 of	 the	 disease.	 First	 of	 all,	 it	 is	 an	 extremely	 long	 drawn, persistent	disease.	It	usually	takes	months,	and	these	months	may	run	into	years, </p>
<p class="calibre1">before	 a	 complete	 cure,	 is	 effected.	 Second,	 relapses	 are	 quite	 common.	 Third, the	 treatment	 is	 a	 disagreeable	 one	 for	 the	 child,	 and	 is	 occasionally	 painful. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>Fourth,	it	has	a	disastrous	effect	on	the	child's	 <i class="calibre4">morale</i>;	most	parents,	though	they may	 love	 the	 child	 most	 affectionately,	 look	 somewhat	 askance	 at	 it;	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">continuous	 vaginal	 treatment	 somehow	 or	 other	 has	 a	 humiliating	 effect	 on	 the child,	 which	 begins	 to	 consider	 itself	 as	 an	 outcast,	 as	 something	 apart	 from other	 children.	 Fifth,	 the	 child's	 education	 is	 very	 frequently	 seriously	 and permanently	 interfered	 with,	 because	 it	 must	 often	 be	 taken	 out	 of	 school, </p>
<p class="calibre1">whether	public	or	private,	and	private	tutoring	is	of	course	feasible	only	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">few.	Sixth,	and	this	is	a	point	not	sufficiently	appreciated	by	the	profession	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	laity,	but	it	is	an	important	point,	nevertheless:	vulvovaginitis	in	children	has</p>
<p class="calibre1">unfortunately	 a	 disastrous	 effect	 in	  <i class="calibre4">hastening	 the	 sexual	 maturity	 of	 the	 child</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether	 this	 is	 due	 to	 the	 congestion	 of	 the	 organs	 produced	 by	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">inflammation,	or	to	the	speculum	examinations,	paintings,	douches,	applications, </p>
<p class="calibre1">tampons,	 suppositories,	 etc.,	 the	 fact	 remains	 that	 girls	 who	 suffer	 from</p>
<p class="calibre1">vulvovaginitis	 in	 childhood	 become	 sexually	 mature	 considerably	 earlier	 than</p>
<p class="calibre1">normal	girls	of	the	same	class,	stratum	and	climate,	and	their	demand	for	sexual</p>
<p class="calibre1">satisfaction	 is	 much	 more	 insistent.	 Seventh,	 a	 mild	 vulvovaginitis	 may	 be	 the cause	of	permanent	 <i class="calibre4">sterility</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 will	 therefore	 be	 seen	 that	 vulvovaginitis	 is	 a	 calamity,	 and	 everything</p>

Under	no	circumstances	should	a	child	sleep with	anybody	else,	be	it	a	sister,	a	mother,	a	friend,	a	governess,	or	a	servant	girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People	should	be	very	careful	in	sending	their	children	to	spend	a	night	or	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	some	friends.	The	friends	may	be	all	right,	but	still	a	friend	of	the	friends	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	relative	of	the	friends	may	not	be.	I	have	known	several	cases	where	the	origin</p>

<p class="calibre1">of	 some	 friends	 where	 a	 boarder	 or	 relative	 was	 infected	 with	 gonorrhea.	 That children	 should	 be	 kept	 away	 from	 associating	 or	 playing	 with	 adults	 or	 other children	who	are	known	to	have	gonorrheal	infection	goes	without	saying.	The</p>

<p class="calibre1">Syphilis	 is	 a	 disease	 caused	 by	 a	 germ	 called	 spirocheta;	 the	 full	 name	 is spirocheta	 pallida—a	 pale,	 spiral-shaped	 germ.	 Though	 the	 disease	 has	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">ravaging	Europe	and	America	for	centuries,	the	germ	of	it	has	been	discovered</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	 a	 few	 years	 ago,	 namely,	 in	 1905,	 and,	 like	 the	 gonococcus,	 also	 by	 a German	 scientist,	 Fritz	 Schaudinn.	 Syphilis	 is	 a	 constitutional	 disease.	 In	 ten days	to	three	weeks	after	a	person	has	contracted	syphilis,	he	(or	she)	develops	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sore	(at	the	spot	where	the	germs	got	in).	This	sore	is	called	 <i class="calibre4">chancre</i>	or	 <i class="calibre4">primary</i> <i class="calibre4">lesion</i>.	 But	 when	 this	 sore	 makes	 its	 appearance	 the	 spirochetæ	 and	 the	 poison which	 they	 elaborate	 are	 already	 circulating	 in	 the	 blood,	 all	 over	 the	 system. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 disease	 is	 already	 systemic,	 or	 constitutional,	 and	 the	 chancre	 is	 the	 local expression	of	a	constitutional	disease.	Cutting	out	the	chancre	will	not	cure	the</p>

This	stage	is	characterized	by	all	sorts	of <i class="calibre4">eruptions</i>,	mild	and	severe,	by	white	little	patches	(called	mucous	patches)	in	the throat,	 mouth,	 tonsils,	 vagina,	 by	 falling	 out	 of	 the	 hair,	 etc.	 The	 length	 of	 this secondary	stage	depends	a	good	deal	upon	the	sort	of	treatment	the	patient	gets. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a>Improperly	treated,	or	not	treated	at	all,	it	may	last	two	or	three	years	or	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Properly	 treated,	 it	 may	 be	 cut	 short	 at	 once,	 in	 a	 few	 days,	 so	 that	 the	 patient may	never	again	in	his	or	her	life	get	an	eruption.

<p class="calibre1">Syphilis	runs	a	milder	course	in	women	than	it	does	in	men.	But	this	milder</p>
<p class="calibre1">course	is	not	an	unmixed	blessing;	it	may	be	considered	a	misfortune,	because, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a>the	same	as	gonorrhea	in	women,	syphilis	is	often	present	for	months	and	years until	it	has	made	such	inroads	that	it	is	but	little	amenable	to	treatment.	In	many</p>
<p class="calibre1">women	 the	 disease	 runs	 such	 a	 mild	 course,	 as	 far	 as	 definite	 symptoms	 are concerned,	that	they	are	sure	they	never	had	anything	the	matter	with	them,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	are	perfectly	sincere	in	their	denial	of	ever	having	had	any	infection.	Often</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 is	 only	 when	 they	 complain	 of	 obscure	 symptoms,	 for	 which	 we	 can	 find	 no explanation,	 and	 then	 take	 a	 Wassermann	 test,	 that	 we	 discover	 what	 the	 real trouble	is.	And	then	the	internal	organs	are	sometimes	found	so	deeply	affected</p>

<p class="calibre1">professional	experience	extending	over	nearly	a	quarter	of	a	century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	to	gonorrhea	in	women,	that	depends	to	a	great	extent	upon	the	virulence</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 disease	 and	 the	 promptness	 with	 which	 treatment	 is	 instituted.	 If	 the gonorrhea	 is	 limited	 only	 to	 the	 cervix,	 the	 vulva	 and	 the	 urethra,	 then	 prompt treatment	will	usually	bring	about	a	cure	in	a	comparatively	short	time.	But	if	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">gonorrheal	inflammation	has	extended	to	the	body	of	the	uterus,	or	still	worse,	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 tubes,	 then	 the	 treatment	 may	 become	 a	 very	 tedious	 one,	 and	 some	 cases may	not	be	curable	without	an	operation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	syphilis	the	matter	is	different.	Since	the	introduction	by	Ehrlich	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">various	 arsenic	 preparations,	 we	 have	 much	 better	 success	 in	 the	 treatment	 of syphilis,	 and	 we	 can	 positively	 render	 every	 case	 non-infectious	 to	 the	 partner. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a>But,	as	to	guaranteeing	a	positive	cure,	that	is,	guaranteeing	that	the	patient	will never	 have	 an	 outbreak	 or	 relapse	 of	 his	 disease	 in	 the	 future,	 and	 that	 the children	will	be	perfectly	free	from	any	taint,	this	we	can	do	no	more	now	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	could	before	the	modern	treatment	of	syphilis	was	introduced.	The	decision, </p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore,	 as	 to	 whether	 we	 may	 or	 may	 not	 permit	 a	 once	 syphilitic	 patient	 to marry	 will	 depend	 a	 great	 deal	 upon	 whether	 or	 no	 the	 husband	 or	 the	 wife	 or both	 desire	 to	 have	 children.	 If	 this	 is	 the	 case,	 we	 must	 often	 withhold	 our permission;	 but	 if	 the	 man	 and	 woman	 agree	 to	 get	 married	 and	 to	 get	 along without	children,	we	will	grant	permission	to	the	marriage	in	the	vast	majority	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">cases.	The	subject	of	venereal	disease	and	marriage	will	be	further	discussed	in</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a>In	 his	 book,  <i class="calibre4">Sex	 Knowledge	 for	 Men</i>,	 the	 author	 treated	 the	 subject	 of prevention	 of	 venereal	 disease	 very	 thoroughly.	 Men	 need	 this	 knowledge.	 As</p>
<p class="calibre1">men	  <i class="calibre4">will</i>	 indulge	 in	 illicit	 relations,	 we	 must	 teach	 them	 to	 guard	 themselves against	venereal	infection.	We	must	do	it	not	only	for	their	own	sake,	but	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sake	of	their	wives	and	children.	For,	infection	in	the	man	may	mean	infection	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 wife	 and	 children.	 But	 as	 women	 readers	 of	 this	 book	 are	 not	 likely	 to indulge	 in	 promiscuous	 relations	 with	 strangers,	 a	 detailed	 discussion	 of	 the subject	would	be	out	of	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	will	merely	say,	that	where	the	woman	has	a	suspicion	that	her	husband	is	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	 infectious	 state,	 she	 should	 abstain	 from	 relations	 with	 him	 until	 she	 is	 sure that	he	is	safe.	But	where	for	some	reason	a	suspicions	intercourse	is	indulged	in, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	woman	should	use	an	antiseptic	douche	 <i class="calibre4">before</i>	and	 <i class="calibre4">after</i>	intercourse.	Where it	is	inconvenient	to	use	a	douche	both	before	and	after,	a	douche	after	will	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	suffice,	but	it	is	much	safer	and	surer	to	use	the	douche	both	before	and	after. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	you	use	a	douche	there	is	always	some	of	the	solution	left	in	the	vagina</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	that	destroys	wholly	or	in	part	the	infective	germs.	The	following	makes	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">effective	douche:	Dissolve	a	tablet	of	bichloride	(they	come	on	the	market	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">weight	of	about	7½	grains)	in	two	quarts	of	water—hot,	lukewarm	or	cold.	Use</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	 intercourse	 a	 small	 amount—about	 a	 pint	 or	 half	 a	 pint,	 and	 use	 the balance	after	intercourse.	Instead	of	the	bichloride	you	may	use	a	tablespoonful</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 carbolic	 acid,	 or	 two	 tablets	 of	 chinosol,	 or	 a	 tablespoonful	 of	 lysol,	 or	 two tablespoonfuls	of	boric	acid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead	of	the	douche	an	antiseptic	jelly	in	a	collapsible	tin	tube	with	a	long</p>
<p class="calibre1">nozzle	may	be	used. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 besides	 the	 venereal	 sources	 of	 infection	 the	 woman	 must	 guard	 against</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	non-venereal	sources.	Do	not	ever,	if	you	can	avoid	it,	use	a	public	toilet.	If</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	are	forced	to	use	it,	protect	yourself	by	putting	some	paper	over	the	seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Do	not	use	a	public	drinking	cup.	If	you	have	to	use	one,	keep	your	lips	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	rim.	One	can	learn	to	drink	without	touching	the	rim	of	the	glass	or	cup</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Do	 not	 under	 any	 circumstances	 use	 a	 public	 towel.	 The	 roller	 towel	 is	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">menace	to	health	and	should	be	forbidden	in	every	part	of	the	country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	you	have	to	sleep	in	a	hotel	or	in	a	strange	bed,	make	sure	that	the	linen	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">clean	and	fresh.	Never	sleep	on	bed	linen	which	has	been	used	by	a	stranger. </p>

<p class="calibre1">the	 chances	 were	 one	 in	 a	 thousand.	 For	 a	 period	 of	 one	 year	 during	 which	 he had	been	engaged	he	abstained	from	sexual	intercourse	altogether,	though	it	cost</p>

<p class="calibre1">made	 him	 accept	 an	 invitation	 to	 a	 bachelor	 dinner,	 where	 champagne	 and</p>

<p class="calibre1">or	at	least	he	would	have	stepped	into	a	drugstore	for	a	prophylactic.	But,	excited</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	 the	 wine,	 the	 smutty	 stories	 and	 the	 year's	 abstinence,	 he	 went	 along	 like	 a sheep,	 as	 a	 matter	 of	 course,	 without	 trying	 to	 reason	 or	 interposing	 any</p>
<p class="calibre1">objections.	 He	 remembers	 distinctly	 his	 feelings	 and	 the	 state	 of	 his	 mind.	 He was	not	drunk,	only	exhilarated,	but	nevertheless	the	whole	thing	seemed	to	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	normal,	so	natural,	so	expected,	so	matter-of-course,	that	he	couldn't	think	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">acting	 otherwise	 than	 accept	 her	 invitation.	 And	 he	 stayed	 two	 or	 three	 hours; and	he	used	no	prophylactic.	And	as	a	result—three	weeks	later	he	had	a	typical</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a>primary	syphilitic	lesion.	How	he	felt	and	what	it	all	meant	to	him	the	reader	can imagine.	This	is	far	from	being	an	isolated,	an	exceptional	case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	my	own	practice	I	could	cite	a	number	of	cases	of	venereal	infection	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	 alcohol	 was	 the	 direct,	 primary	 factor.	 How	 many	 such	 cases	 there	 are altogether	 in	 the	 period	 of	 a	 year	 nobody	 can	 say,	 but	 that	 they	 constitute	 a considerable	 percentage	 of	 the	 total	 venereal	 morbidity	 every	 investigating</p>
<p class="calibre1">sexologist	 will	 testify.	 Forel	 claims	 that	 76	 per	 cent.	 of	 all	 venereal	 infection takes	 place	 under	 the	 influence	 of	 alcohol;	 Notthaft	 is	 more	 moderate,	 more</p>
<p class="calibre1">discriminating	 in	 his	 statistics	 and	 his	 claims	 are—30	 per	 cent.	 An	 analysis	 of 1,000	cases	of	venereal	infection,	just	published	by	Dr.	Hugo	Hecht	( <i class="calibre4">Venerische</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Infektion	und	Alkohol,	Z.B.G. </i>,	Vol.	XVI,	No.	11)	gives	over	40	per	cent.	And	the saddest	 part	 of	 it	 is	 that	 among	 the	 infected	 were	 75	 married	 men	 (the	 author thinks	 there	 were	 more,	 but	 only	 75	 confessed	 to	 being	 married),	 and	 of	 these, 45,	 equivalent	 to	 60	 per	 cent.,	 were	 under	 the	 influence	 of	 alcohol	 when	 they contracted	their	venereal	disease	(extra-matrimonially,	of	course). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alcoholic	indulgence	contributes	to	the	spread	of	venereal	disease	directly	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">indirectly.	First	and	foremost	it	increases	enormously	the	amount	of	intercourse</p>
<p class="calibre1">indulged	in.	I	certainly	do	not	belong	to	those	who	believe	that	the	sex	instinct	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">merely	a	vicious	appetite,	like	the	appetite	for	alcohol	or	drugs,	which	can	easily</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 completely	 be	 suppressed	 by	 the	 exertion	 of	 will-power.	 I	 believe	 that	 the sex	 instinct	 can	 be	 suppressed	 only	 within	 reasonable	 limits;	 if	 an	 attempt	 is made	to	exceed	these	limits	dire	results	are	apt	to	follow.	But	I	also	believe	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 sex	 instinct	 can	 be	 stimulated	 artificially	 beyond	 the	 natural	 needs,	 and among	 the	 artificial	 stimulants	 of	 the	 sex	 instinct	 alcohol	 occupies	 first	 place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 bear	 in	 mind	 that	 alcohol	 produces	 even	 a	 stronger	 effect	 on	 women,	 in exciting	the	sexual	passion,	than	it	does	on	men.	Women	are	more	easily	upset</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	stimulants	and	narcotics,	and	that	is	the	reason	why	it	is	more	dangerous	for</p>

<p class="calibre1">the	 result	 that	 the	 chances	 of	 venereal	 infection	 are	 greatly	 increased.	 Count three:	Where	under	ordinary	circumstances	the	man	would	stay	a	few	minutes	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>half	an	hour,	under	the	influence	of	alcohol	he	stays	several	hours,	or	all	night, thus	 increasing	 his	 chances	 of	 infection	 a	 hundredfold.	 Count	 four:	 Alcohol</p>
<p class="calibre1">increases	 the	 congestion	 in	 the	 genital	 organs	 of	 both	 man	 and	 woman	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">renders	them	much	more	 <i class="calibre4">susceptible</i>	to	infection.	All	other	factors	being	equal,	a connection	 which	 will	 under	 strict	 sobriety	 remain	 without	 bad	 results,	 may</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	 one	 or	 both	 partners	 are	 under	 the	 influence	 of	 alcohol	 be	 followed	 by infection.	 Count	 five:	 The	 man	 who	 is	 in	 the	 habit	 of	 using	 venereal</p>
<p class="calibre1">prophylactics	under	the	influence	of	alcohol	becomes	both	careless	and	reckless; </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 looks	 with	 contempt	 at	 preventive	 measures	 and	 the	 result	 is—venereal</p>
<p class="calibre1">disease. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 is	 impossible	 to	 give	 statistics	 and	 exact	 or	 even	 approximate	 figures.	 But there	is	no	question	in	my	mind,	in	the	mind	of	any	careful	investigator,	that	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">alcoholic	 beverages	 could	 be	 eliminated,	 the	 number	 of	 cases	 of	 venereal</p>
<p class="calibre1">infection	 would	 be	 diminished	 by	 about	 one-half.	 And	 what	 is	 true	 of	 venereal disease	 is	 also	 true	 of	 seduction	 of	 young	 girls.	 Alcohol	 is	 the	 most	 efficient weapon	that	either	the	refined	Don	Juan	or	the	vulgar	pimp	has	in	his	possession. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 case	 of	 a	 woman,	 the	 decision	 may	 be	 harder	 to	 reach	 than	 in	 that	 of	 a man.	 Of	 course,	 the	 urine	 must	 be	 clear	 and	 the	 urethra	 must	 be	 normal; </p>
<p class="calibre1">however,	 we	 cannot	 insist	 that	 there	 must	 be	 no	 discharge.	 This,	 because</p>

<p class="calibre1">at	 least	 immediately	 prior	 and	 subsequent	 to	 menstruation.	 Of	 course,	 the</p>

<p class="calibre1">Here,	we	have	to	go	a	good	deal	by	the	history	given	us.	If	the	woman,	during</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a>appendages,	either	spontaneous	or	on	examination,	and,	if	several	examinations made	 within	 a	 day	 or	 two	 following	 menstruation	 are	 negative,	 then	 we	 may</p>
<p class="calibre1">assume	that	she	is	cured.	It	is	important,	though,	that	this	examination	be	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	last	day	of	menstruation	or	on	the	first	or	second	day	following;	for	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	 many	 cases	 in	 which	 no	 pus	 and	 no	 gonococci	 will	 show	 in	 the	 inter-</p>

<p class="calibre1">blood	and	portions	of	mucous	membrane	that	are	shed	during	menstruation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 best,	 it	 is	 a	 delicate	 problem,	 so	 that	 whenever	 there	 has	 been	 the	 least suspicion	that	the	woman	may	harbor	gonococci	I	have	always	advised	(as	is	my</p>

<p class="calibre1">adopted,	I	have	never	had	an	accident	happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The	Question	of	Probable	Sterility. </b>	Thus	far	I	have	considered	the	problem</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 marriage	 from	 the	 standpoint	 of	 infectivity.	 But,	 we	 know	 that,	 besides	 the effect	on	the	individual,	gonorrhea	has	also	a	far-reaching	influence	on	the	race; </p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 other	 words,	 that	 it	 is	 prone	 to	 make	 the	 subjects—both	 men	 and	 women—</p>
<p class="calibre1">sterile.	 And	 a	 candidate	 for	 marriage	 may,	 and	 often	 does,	 want	 to	 know</p>
<p class="calibre1">whether,	besides	being	noninfective,	he	or	she	is	capable	of	begetting	or	having</p>
<p class="calibre1">children. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 case	 of	 man,	 the	 problem	 is,	 fortunately,	 a	 very	 simple	 one.	 We	 can easily	 obtain	 a	 specimen	 of	 the	 man's	 semen	 and	 determine,	 by	 means	 of	 the microscope,	whether	it	contains	spermatozoa	or	not.	If	it	does	contain	a	normal</p>
<p class="calibre1">number	 of	 lively,	 rapidly	 moving	 spermatozoa,	 the	 man	 is	 fertile,	 regardless	 of whether	he	ever	had	epididymitis	or	not.	If	the	semen	contains	no	spermatozoa, </p>
<p class="calibre1">or	only	a	few	deformed	or	lazily	moving	ones,	then	he	is	sterile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 case	 of	 woman,	 it	 is	  <i class="calibre4">absolutely</i>	 impossible	 to	 determine	 whether	 the gonorrhea	has	made	her	sterile	or	not;	because	there	is	no	way	of	expressing	an</p>

<p class="calibre1">the	Fallopian	tubes,	and	yet	there	may	have	been	sufficient	inflammation	to	close</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	 the	 orifices	 of	 the	 tubes.	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 she	 may	 have	 had	 a	 severe salpingitis	 on	  <i class="calibre4">both	 sides	 and	 still	 be	 fertile</i>.	 Nor	 is	 there	 any	 way	 of	 telling whether	 the	 ovaries	 were	 so	 involved	 in	 the	 process	 as	 to	 become	 incapable	 of generating	healthy	ova,	or	any	ova	at	all.	In	short,	there	is	absolutely	no	way	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">telling	 whether	 a	 woman	 is	 sterile	 or	 fertile—we	 can	 only	 surmise.	 And	 our</p>
<p class="calibre1">surmise	in	this	respect	is	liable	to	be	wrong	just	as	often	as	right.	The	only	way</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 question	 can	 be	 decided	 is	 by	 experience.	 If	 the	 prospective	 husband	 is</p>

<p class="calibre1">The	 problem	 of	 the	 syphilitic	 differs	 from	 the	 problem	 of	 the	 exgonorrheal</p>
<p class="calibre1">patient.	 When	 a	 gonorrheal	 patient	 is	 cured,	 so	 far	 as	 infectivity	 is	 concerned, and	is	not	sterile,	there	is	no	apprehension	as	to	the	offspring.	Gonorrhea	is	not</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>the	offspring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	rules	for	permitting	a	man	or	a	woman	who	once	had	syphilis	to	marry, </p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore,	are	different	from	those	applied	to	the	gonorrheal	patient.	Here	are	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rules:</p>
<p class="calibre1">1.	I	would	make	it	an	invariable	rule	that	no	syphilitic	patient	should	marry	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">should	 be	 permitted	 to	 marry	 before	  <i class="calibre4">five</i>	 years	 have	 elapsed	 from	 the	 day	 of infection.	But	the	period	of	time	alone	is	not	sufficient;	other	conditions	must	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">met	before	we	may	give	a	syphilitic	patient	permission	to	marry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2.	The	man	or	the	woman	must	have	received	thorough	systematic	treatment</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 at	 least	 three	 years,	 either	 constantly	 or	 off	 and	 on,	 according	 to	 the physician's	judgment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">3.	 For	 at	 least	 one	 year	 before	 the	 intended	 marriage,	 the	 person	 must	 have been	 absolutely	 free	 from	 any	 manifestations	 of	 syphilis;	 that	 is,	 from	 any</p>
<p class="calibre1">eruptions	 on	 the	 skin,	 from	 any	 mucous	 patches,	 swelling	 in	 the	 bones, </p>
<p class="calibre1">ulcerations,	and	so	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">4.	 Four	 Wassermann	 tests,	 taken	 at	 intervals	 of	 three	 months	 and	 at	 a	 time <i class="calibre4">when	 the	 patient	 was	 receiving	 no	 specific	 treatment</i>,	 must	 be	 absolutely negative. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 these	 four	 conditions	 are	 fully	 met,	 then	 the	 patient	 may	 be	 permitted	 to marry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 is	 important,	 however,	 to	 state	 that,	 in	 permitting	 or	 refusing	 syphilitic persons	to	marry,	we	are	guided	to	a	great	extent	by	the	fact	as	to	whether	they</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">expect	to	have	children	soon	or	not</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 case	 of	 a	 couple	 who	 are	 anxious	 to	 have	 children	 soon	 after	 their marriage,	the	conditions	for	our	permission	must	be	more	severe	than	when	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">couple	are	willing	or	anxious	to	use	contraceptive	measures	for	the	first	years	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 married	 life.	 For,	 if	 a	 man	 is	 free	 from	 any	 skin	 lesions	 and	 from	 any mucous	patches,	his	wife	is	safe	from	infection	 <i class="calibre4">as	long	as	she	does	not	become</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">pregnant</i>.	 But,	 if	 she	 does	 get	 pregnant,	 she	 may	 become	 infected	 through	 the fetus;	and,	of	course,	the	child	also	is	liable	to	be	syphilitic.	Hence,	much	stricter</p>
<p class="calibre1">requirements	for	syphilitics	who	expect	to	become	parents	are	necessary	than	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">those	who	do	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	case	both	the	man	and	the	woman	are	or	have	been	syphilitic,	permission	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">marry	may	be	granted	without	hesitation,	as	the	danger	of	infection	is	absent,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">permission	 to	 have	 children	 must	 be	 refused	  <i class="calibre4">absolutely</i>	 and	  <i class="calibre4">unequivocally</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>Regardless	 of	 the	 time	 that	 may	 have	 elapsed	 from	 the	 period	 of	 infection, regardless	of	treatment,	regardless	of	Wassermann	tests,	the	danger	to	the	child</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	too	great	if	both	parents	have	the	syphilitic	taint	in	them.	A	healthy	child	 <i class="calibre4">may</i> be	born	from	two	syphilitic	parents	who	have	undergone	energetic	treatment,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	 have	 no	 right	 to	 take	 the	 chance.	 I,	 at	 least,	 never	 wanted	 to,	 nor	 ever	 will want	to,	take	such	a	responsibility. </p>

<p class="calibre1">that	some	trouble	may	not	develop	later	in	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	 shall	 we	 do	 in	 such	 cases	 and	 what	 particularly	 shall	 we	 do	 if,	 from	 a general	examination	of	the	patient,	we	carry	away	the	impression	that,	while	free</p>

<p class="calibre1">I	 told	 the	 girl	 (the	 man	 was	 thirty-five,	 she	 was	 thirty-two)	 that	 I	 could	 not render	 a	 definite	 decision	 in	 the	 matter,	 that	 everything	 might	 be	 all	 right,	 and then	again	it	might	not;	but,	that	the	question	about	children	she	would	have	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">decide	definitely,	once	for	all,	namely,	that	she	was	not	to	have	any	children.	She</p>

<p class="calibre1">All	she	wanted	to	know	was,	whether	she	was	in	danger	of	being	infected.	I	told</p>

<p class="calibre1">general	paresis	or	locomotor	ataxia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 girl	 had	 been	 a	 teacher	 for	 about	 twelve	 years,	 and	 she	 was	 so	 sick	 at heart	of	the	work,	was	so	anxious	for	a	home	of	her	own,	that	she	decided	to	take</p>

<p class="calibre1">In	 former	 years,	 nobody	 thought	 of	 asking	 a	 physician	 for	 permission	 to	 get married.	He	was	not	consulted	in	the	matter	at	all.	The	parents	would	investigate</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	young	man's	social	standing,	his	ability	to	make	a	living,	his	habits	perhaps, </p>
<p class="calibre1">whether	he	was	a	drinking	man	or	not,	but	to	ask	the	physician's	expert	advice—</p>
<p class="calibre1">why,	as	said,	nobody	thought	of	it.	And	how	much	sorrow	and	unhappiness,	how</p>
<p class="calibre1">many	 tragedies	 the	 doctor	 could	 have	 averted,	 if	 he	 had	 been	 asked	 in	 time! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fortunately,	in	the	last	few	years,	a	great	change	has	taken	place	in	this	respect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 is	 now	 a	 very	 common	 occurrence	 for	 the	 intelligent	 layman	 and	 laywoman, imbued	with	a	sense	of	responsibility	for	the	welfare	of	their	presumptive	future</p>
<p class="calibre1">offspring	 and	 actuated,	 perhaps,	 also	 by	 some	 fear	 of	 infection,	 to	 consult	 a physician	 as	 to	 the	 advisability	 of	 the	 marriage,	 leaving	 it	 to	 him	 to	 make	 the decision	and	they	abiding	by	that	decision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 a	 matter	 of	 fact,	 as	 often	 is	 the	 case,	 the	 pendulum	 now	 is	 in	 danger	 of swinging	to	the	other	extreme;	for,	a	little	knowledge	is	a	dangerous	thing,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 tendency	 of	 the	 layman	 is	 to	 exaggerate	 matters	 and	 to	 take	 things	 in	 an absolute	instead	of	in	a	relative	manner.	As	a	result,	many	laymen	and	laywomen</p>
<p class="calibre1">nowadays	insist	upon	a	thorough	examination	of	their	own	person	and	the	person</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	their	future	partner,	when	there	is	nothing	the	matter	with	either.	Still,	this	is	a minor	evil,	and	it	is	better	to	be	too	careful	than	not	careful	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	am	frequently	consulted	as	to	the	advisability	or	nonadvisability	of	a	certain</p>
<p class="calibre1">marriage	 taking	 place.	 I,	 therefore,	 thought	 it	 desirable	 to	 discuss	 in	 a	 separate chapter	the	various	factors,	physical	and	mental,	personal	and	ancestral,	likely	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">exert	an	influence	upon	the	marital	partner	and	on	the	expected	offspring,	and	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">state	as	briefly	as	possible	and	so	far	as	our	present	state	of	knowledge	permits</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	 factors	 may	 be	 considered	 eugenic,	 or	 favorable	 to	 the	 offspring,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">dysgenic,	or	unfavorable	to	the	offspring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 questions	 concerning	 the	 advisability	 of	 marriage	 which	 the	 layman	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">well	 as	 the	 physician	 have	 most	 often	 to	 deal	 with	 are	 questions	 concerning venereal	 disease.	 On	 account	 of	 the	 importance	 of	 the	 subject,	 these	 have	 been discussed	 rather	 in	 detail	 under	 the	 headings	 "Gonorrhea	 and	 Marriage"	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Syphilis	and	Marriage."	Other	factors	affecting	marriage,	either	in	the	eugenic</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a>or	 dysgenic	 sense,	 will	 be	 discussed	 more	 briefly	 in	 the	 present	 chapter,	 and more	or	less	in	the	order	of	their	importance. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Tuberculosis</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Tuberculosis,	 which	 carries	 off	 such	 a	 large	 part	 of	 humanity	 every	 year,	 is caused	by	the	well-known	bacillus	tuberculosis,	discovered	by	Koch.	The	germ</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	generally	inhaled	through	the	respiratory	tract,	and	most	frequently	settles	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 lungs,	 giving	 rise	 to	 what	 is	 known	 as	 pulmonary	 consumption.	 However, </p>
<p class="calibre1">many	other	organs	and	tissues	may	be	affected	by	tuberculosis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tuberculosis	 used	 to	 be	 considered	 the	 hereditary	 disease	  <i class="calibre4">par	 excellence</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Entire	families	were	carried	off	by	it,	and,	seeing	a	tuberculous	father	or	mother</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 then	 tuberculous	 children,	 it	 was	 assumed	 that	 the	 infection	 had	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">transmitted	 to	 the	 children	 by	 heredity.	 As	 a	 matter	 of	 fact,	 the	 disease	 was spread	 by	 infection.	 In	 former	 years,	 little	 care	 was	 exercised	 about	 destroying the	sputum;	the	patients	would	spit	indiscriminately	on	the	floor,	and	the	sputum, </p>
<p class="calibre1">drying	 up,	 would	 be	 mixed	 with	 the	 dust	 and	 inhaled.	 Often	 the	 children</p>
<p class="calibre1">crawling	on	the	floor	would	introduce	the	infective	material	directly,	by	putting</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	little	fingers	in	their	mouths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	now	known	that	tuberculosis	is	not	a	hereditary	disease,	that	is,	that	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">germs	 are	 not	 transmitted	 by	 heredity.  <i class="calibre4">The	 weak	 constitution</i>,	 however,	 which favors	the	development	of	tuberculosis,	is	inherited.	And	children	of	tuberculous</p>
<p class="calibre1">parents,	 therefore,	 must	 not	 only	 be	 guarded	 against	 infection,	 but	 must	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">brought	 up	 with	 special	 care,	 so	 as	 to	 strengthen	 their	 resistance	 and	 overcome the	weakened	constitution	which	they	inherited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 a	 person	 with	 an	 active	 tuberculous	 lesion	 should	 not	 get	 married	 goes without	 saying.	 But,	 it	 is	 a	 good	 rule	 to	 follow	 for	 a	 tuberculous	 person	 not	 to marry	 for	 two	 or	 three	 years,	 until	 all	 tuberculous	 lesions	 have	 been	 declared healed	 by	 a	 competent	 physician.	 As	 a	 rule,	 a	 tuberculous	 patient	 is	 a	 poor provider,	 and	 that	 also	 counts	 in	 the	 advice	 against	 marriage.	 Then	 sexual</p>
<p class="calibre1">intercourse	has,	as	a	rule,	a	strong	influence	on	the	development	of	the	disease. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately	the	sexual	appetite	of	tuberculous	patients	is	not	diminished,	but, </p>
<p class="calibre1">rather,	 very	 frequently	 heightened;	 and	 frequent	 sexual	 relations	 weaken	 them</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	hasten	the	progress	of	the	disease. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 to	 pregnancy,	 that	 has	 an	 extremely	 pernicious	 effect	 on	 the	 course	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>tuberculosis,	 and	 no	 tuberculous	 woman	 should	 ever	 marry.	 If	 such	 a	 one	 does marry	or	if	the	disease	develops	after	her	getting	married,	means	should	be	given</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	to	prevent	her	from	having	children.	During	the	pregnancy,	the	disease	may</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	seem	to	be	making	any	progress—occasionally	the	patient	may	even	seem	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">improve—but	 after	 childbirth	 the	 disease	 makes	 very	 rapid	 strides	 and	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">patient	may	quickly	succumb.	In	the	early	days	of	my	practice	I	saw	a	number	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">such	 cases.	 If	 precautions	 are	 taken	 against	 pregnancy,	 then	 permission	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">indulge	 in	 sexual	 relations	 may	 be	 given,	 provided	 it	 is	 done	 rarely	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">moderately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 a	 patient	 who	 has	 tuberculosis	 conceals	 the	 fact	 from	 the	 future	 partner,	 a fraud	is	committed,	and	the	marriage	is	morally	annullable.	It	has	been	declared</p>
<p class="calibre1">legally	annullable	by	a	recent	decision	of	a	New	York	judge. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Heart	Disease</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Heart	 disease	 also	 is	 no	 longer	 considered	 hereditary.	 Nevertheless,	 heart</p>
<p class="calibre1">disease,	 if	 at	 all	 serious,	 is	 a	 contraindication	 to	 marriage.	 First,	 because	 the patient's	life	may	be	cut	off	at	any	time.	Second,	sexual	intercourse	is	injurious</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 people	 having	 heart	 disease;	 it	 may	 aggravate	 the	 disease	 or	 even	 cause sudden	death.	It	is	more	injurious	even	than	it	is	in	tuberculosis.	Third—and	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">concerns	 the	 woman	 only—pregnancy	 has	 a	  <i class="calibre4">very</i>	 detrimental	 effect	 upon	 a diseased	 heart.	 A	 heart	 that,	 with	 proper	 care,	 might	 be	 able	 to	 do	 its	 work	 for years,	often	is	suddenly	snapped	by	the	extra	work	put	upon	it	by	pregnancy	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">childbirth.	 Sometimes	 a	 woman	 with	 a	 diseased	 heart	 will	 keep	 up	 to	 the	 last minute	of	the	delivery	of	the	child	and	then	suddenly	will	gasp	and	expire.	In	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">first	 year	 of	 my	 practice	 I	 saw	 such	 a	 case,	 and	 I	 never	 have	 wanted	 to	 see another.	Women	suffering	from	heart	disease	of	any	serious	character	should	not, </p>
<p class="calibre1">under	any	circumstance,	be	permitted	to	become	pregnant. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Cancer</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">No	 man	 will	 knowingly	 marry	 a	 woman,	 and	 no	 woman	 will	 marry	 a	 man, </p>
<p class="calibre1">afflicted	with	cancer.	However,	this	question	often	comes	up	in	cases	where	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">matrimonial	candidates	are	free	from	cancer,	but	where	there	has	been	cancer	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	family. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a>Cancer	 is	 not	 a	 hereditary	 disease,	 contrary	 to	 the	 opinions	 that	 have prevailed,	 and,	 if	 the	 matrimonial	 candidate	 otherwise	 is	 healthy,	 no	 hesitation need	be	felt	on	the	score	of	heredity.	The	fear	of	hereditary	transmission	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">disease	 has	 caused	 a	 great	 deal	 of	 mischief	 and	 unnecessary	 anxiety	 to	 people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scientifically	 conducted	 investigations	 and	 carefully	 prepared	 statistics	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">shown	 that	 many	 diseases	 formerly	 considered	 hereditary	 are	 not	 hereditary	 in the	least	degree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Should	 it,	 however,	 be	 shown	 that	 in	 one	 family	 there	 were	  <i class="calibre4">many</i>	 members who	died	of	cancer,	it	would	indicate	that	there	is	some	disease	or	dyscrasia	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 family,	 and	 the	 contracting	 of	 a	 marriage	 with	 any	 member	 of	 that	 family would	be	inadvisable. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Exophthalmic	Goiter	(Basedow's	Disease)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Exophthalmic	goiter	is	a	disease	characterised	by	enlargement	of	the	thyroid</p>
<p class="calibre1">gland,	 protrusion	 of	 the	 eyeballs,	 and	 rapid	 beating	 of	 the	 heart.	 The	 disease	 is confined	 almost	 entirely,	 though	 not	 exclusively,	 to	 women,	 and	 I	 should	 not advise	 any	 exophthalmic	 woman	 to	 marry;	 neither	 should	 I	 advise	 a	 man	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">marry	an	exophthalmic	goiter	woman.	It	is	a	very	annoying	disease,	while	sexual</p>

<p class="calibre1">The	 children,	 if	 not	 affected	 by	 exophthalmic	 goiter,	 are	 liable	 to	 be	 very neurotic. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Simple	 goiter</i>,	 that	 is,	 enlargement	 of	 the	 thyroid	 gland	 (chiefly	 occurring	 in certain	 high	 mountainous	 localities,	 such	 as	 Switzerland),	 is	 not	 so	 strongly dysgenic	 as	 is	 exophthalmic	 goiter.

<p class="calibre1">Of	course,	there	are	always	exceptions.	I	know	an	exophthalmic	goiter	woman</p>

<p class="calibre1">writing	we	can	only	speak	of	the	average	and	not	of	exceptions. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Obesity</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Obesity,	or	excessive	stoutness,	is	an	undue	development	of	fat	throughout	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">body.	 That	 it	 is	 hereditary,	 that	 it	 runs	 in	 families,	 there	 is	 no	 question</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a>whatsoever.	 And,	 while	 with	 great	 care	 as	 to	 the	 diet	 and	 by	 proper	 exercise, obesity	may,	as	a	rule,	be	avoided	in	those	predisposed,	it	none	the	less	often	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">develop	 in	 spite	 of	 all	 measures	 taken	 against	 it.	 Some	 very	 obese	 people	 eat only	one-half	or	less	of	what	many	thin	people	do;	but	in	the	former,	everything</p>
<p class="calibre1">seems	to	run	to	fat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Obesity	must	be	considered	a	dysgenic	factor.	The	obese	are	subject	to	heart</p>
<p class="calibre1">disease,	 asthma,	 apoplexy,	 gallstones,	 gout,	 diabetes,	 constipation;	 they</p>
<p class="calibre1">withstand	pneumonia	and	acute	infectious	diseases	poorly,	and	they	are	bad	risks</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	 they	 have	 to	 undergo	 major	 surgical	 operations.	 They	 also,	 as	 a	 rule,	 are readily	 fatigued	 by	 physical	 and	 mental	 work.	 (As	 to	 the	 latter,	 there	 are</p>
<p class="calibre1">remarkable	exceptions.	Some	very	obese	people	can	turn	out	a	great	amount	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">work,	 and	 are	 almost	 indefatigable	 in	 their	 constant	 activity.)	 Each	 case	 should be	considered	individually,	and	with	reference	to	the	respective	family	history.	If</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 obese	 person	 comes	 from	 a	 healthy,	 long	 lived	 family	 and	 shows	 no</p>
<p class="calibre1">circulatory	disturbances,	no	strong	objections	can	be	raised	to	him	or	to	her.	But, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	a	general	proposition,	it	must	be	laid	down	that	obesity	is	a	dysgenic	factor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	bear	in	mind	that	obesity	and	stoutness	are	not	synonymous	terms. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Arteriosclerosis</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Arteriosclerosis	 means	 hardening	 of	 the	 arteries.	 All	 men	 over	 fifty	 are</p>
<p class="calibre1">beginning	to	develop	some	degree	of	arteriosclerosis;	but,	if	the	process	is	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">gradual,	it	may	be	considered	normal	and	is	not	a	danger	to	life;	when,	however, </p>
<p class="calibre1">it	develops	rapidly	and	the	blood	pressure	is	of	a	high	degree,	there	is	danger	of</p>

<p class="calibre1">considered	decided	bars	to	marriage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 must	 be	 borne	 in	 mind	 that	 the	 sexual	 act	 is,	 in	 itself,	 a	 danger	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">arteriosclerotics	and	people	with	high	blood	pressure,	because	it	may	bring	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">rupture	of	a	blood-vessel.	There	are	many	cases	of	sudden	death	from	this	cause</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 which	 the	 public	 naturally	 never	 learns.	 Married	 persons	 who	 find	 that	 they have	arteriosclerosis	or	high	blood	pressure	should	abstain	from	sexual	relations</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Gout</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a>A	consideration	of	gout	in	connection	with	the	question	of	heredity	will	show how	near-sighted	people	can	be,	how	they	can	go	on	believing	a	certain	thing	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">centuries	without	analyzing,	until	somebody	suddenly	shows	them	the	absurdity</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	thing.	Gout	was	always	considered	a	typical	hereditary	disease;	for	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">seen	 in	 the	 grandfathers,	 fathers,	 children,	 grandchildren,	 and	 so	 on.	 So, </p>
<p class="calibre1">certainly,	 it	 must	 be	 hereditary!	 It	 did	 not	 come	 to	 our	 doctors'	 minds	 to	 think that	perhaps,	after	all,	it	was	not	heredity	that	was	to	blame,	but	simply	that	 <i class="calibre4">the</i> <i class="calibre4">same	conditions</i>	that	produced	gout	in	the	ancestors	likewise	produced	it	in	their descendants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 know	 now	 that	 gout	 is	 caused	 by	 excessive	 eating,	 excessive	 drinking, </p>
<p class="calibre1">lack	of	exercise,	and	faulty	elimination.	And,	since,	as	a	general	thing,	children</p>
<p class="calibre1">lead	 the	 same	 lives	 that	 their	 fathers	 did,	 they	 are	 likely	 to	 develop	 the	 same diseases	 as	 their	 fathers	 did.	 A	 poor	 man	 who	 leads	 an	 abstemious	 life	 doesn't develop	 gout,	 and	 if	 his	 children	 lead	 the	 same	 abstemious	 lives	 they	 do	 not develop	gout.	(There	are	some	cases	of	gout	among	the	poor,	but	they	are	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">rare.)	But	if	they	should	begin	to	gorge	and	live	an	improper	life	they	would	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">prone	to	develop	the	disease. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 disease,	 therefore,	 cannot	 in	 any	 way	 be	 considered	 hereditary.	 In</p>
<p class="calibre1">matrimony,	gout	in	either	of	the	couple	is	not	a	desirable	quality,	but	it	is	not	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bar	to	marriage;	and,	if	the	candidate	individually	is	healthy	and	free	from	gout, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	fact	that	there	was	gout	in	the	ancestry	should	play	no	rôle. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Mumps</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Mumps	 is	 the	 common	 name	 for	 what	 is	 technically	 called	 parotitis	 (or</p>
<p class="calibre1">parotiditis).	Parotitis	is	an	inflammation	of	the	parotid	glands.	The	parotid	glands</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	situated,	one	on	each	side,	immediately	in	front	and	below	the	external	ear, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 they	 are	 between	 one-half	 and	 one	 ounce	 in	 weight.	 They	 belong	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">salivary	 glands;	 that	 is,	 they	 manufacture	 saliva,	 and	 each	 parotid	 gland	 has	 a duct	through	which	it	pours	the	saliva	into	the	mouth.	These	ducts	open	opposite</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	second	upper	molar	teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	might	be	surprised	to	be	told	that	these	parotid	glands	can	have	anything</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	do	with	the	sex	organs,	but	there	is	no	other	remote	organ	that	has	such	a	close</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 rather	 mysterious	 relationship	 with	 the	 sex-glands	 as	 have	 the	 parotids. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	parotid	glands,	either	one	or	both,	are	inflamed,	the	testicles	or	ovaries</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	also	liable	to	be	attacked	by	inflammation.	The	inflammation	of	the	testicles</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>may	 be	 so	 severe	 as	 to	 cause	 them	 to	 shrivel	 and	 dry	 up;	 or,	 even	 when	 no shrivelling,	 no	 atrophy	 of	 the	 testicles	 occurs,	 they	 may	 be	 so	 affected	 as	 to become	 incapable	 of	 producing	 spermatozoa.	 Moreover,	 in	 cases	 where	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">testicles	 of	 a	 mumps	 patient	 seemingly	 were	 not	 attacked—that	 is,	 where	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">patient	 was	 not	 aware	 of	 any	 inflammation,	 having	 no	 pain	 and	 no	 other</p>
<p class="calibre1">symptoms—the	testicles	may	have	become	incapable	of	generating	spermatozoa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Besides	the	testicles,	the	prostate	gland,	the	secretion	of	which	is	necessary	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	fertility	of	the	spermatozoa,	may	also	become	affected	and	 <i class="calibre4">atrophied</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 is,	 therefore,	 a	 very	 common	 thing	 for	 men	 who	 had	 the	 mumps	 in	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1">childhood	to	be	found	sterile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 to	 the	 sexual	 power	 of	 mumps	 patients,	 that	 differs.	 Some	 patients	 lose</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	virility	entirely;	others	remain	potent,	but	become	sterile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	same	thing	happens	to	girls	attacked	by	mumps.	They	may	have	a	severe</p>

<p class="calibre1">severe	 or	 even	 dangerous	 hemorrhage.	 The	 slightest	 blow,	 squeeze	 or	 hurt	 will cause	  <i class="calibre4">ecchymoses</i>,	 or	 discolorations	 of	 the	 skin.	 The	 peculiarity	 of	 this hereditary	 disease	 is,	 that	 it	 attacks	 almost	 exclusively	 the	 males,	 but	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">transmitted	almost	exclusively	through	the	female	members.	For	instance,	Miss</p>

<p class="calibre1">What	 is	 the	 lesson?	 The	 lesson	 is,	 that	 boys	 who	 are	 bleeders	 may	 marry, </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Anemia</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Anemia	 is	 a	 poor	 condition	 of	 the	 blood.	 The	 blood	 may	 contain	 an</p>

<p class="calibre1">coloring	 matter	 of	 the	 blood,	 that	 is,	 hemoglobin.	 A	 special	 kind	 of	 anemia affecting	young	girls	is	called	chlorosis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anemia	 and	 chlorosis	 cannot	 be	 considered	 contra-indications	 to	 marriage, </p>
<p class="calibre1">because	 they	 are	 usually	 amenable	 to	 treatment.	 In	 fact,	 some	 cases	 of	 anemia and	chlorosis	are	due	to	the	lack	of	normal	sexual	relations,	and	the	subjects	get</p>

<p class="calibre1">hereditary	 as	 it	 was	 one	 time	 thought	 to	 be,	 its	 hereditary	 character	 being ascertainable	 in	 only	 about	 5	 per	 cent.	 of	 cases,	 nevertheless,	 it	 is	 a	 decidedly dysgenic	 agent,	 and	 marriage	 with	 an	 epileptic	 is	 distinctly	 advised	 against. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where	 both	 parents	 are	 epileptics,	 the	 children	 are	 almost	 sure	 to	 be	 epileptic, and	such	a	marriage	should	be	prohibited	by	law.	Under	no	circumstances	should</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Hysteria</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a>Hysteria	 is	 a	 disease	 the	 chief	 characteristics	 of	 which	 are	 a	  <i class="calibre4">lack	 of	 control</i> over	one's	emotions	and	acts,	the	 <i class="calibre4">imitation</i>	of	the	symptoms	of	various	diseases, and	 an	  <i class="calibre4">exaggerated</i>	 self-consciousness.	 The	 patient	 may	 have	 extreme	 pain	 in the	region	of	the	head,	ovaries,	spine;	in	some	parts	of	the	skin	there	is	extreme</p>
<p class="calibre1">hypersensitiveness	 (hyperesthesia),	 so	 that	 the	 least	 touch	 causes	 great	 pain;	 in others,	there	is	complete	anesthesia—that	is,	absence	of	sensation—so	that	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	stick	the	patient	with	a	needle	she	will	not	feel	it.	A	very	frequent	symptom</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 a	 choking	 sensation,	 as	 if	 a	 ball	 came	 up	 the	 throat	 and	 stuck	 there	 (globus hystericus).	 Then	 there	 may	 be	 spasms,	 convulsions,	 retention	 of	 urine, </p>
<p class="calibre1">paralysis,	 aphonia	 (loss	 of	 voice),	 blindness,	 and	 a	 lot	 more.	 There	 is	 hardly	 a functional	or	organic	nervous	disorder	that	hysteria	may	not	simulate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	 late	 years	 our	 ideas	 about	 hysteria	 have	 undergone	 a	 radical	 change,	 and we	 now	 know	 that	 most,	 if	 not	 all,	 cases	 of	 hysteria	 are	 due	 to	 a	 repression	 or non-satisfaction	of	the	sexual	instinct	or	to	some	shock	of	a	sexual	character	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">childhood.	Only	too	often	a	girl	who	was	very	hysterical	before	marriage	loses</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	hysteria	as	if	by	magic	upon	contracting	a	 <i class="calibre4">satisfactory</i>	marriage.	On	the	other hand,	a	healthy	girl	can	become	quickly	hysterical	if	she	marries	a	man	who	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">sexually	impotent	or	who	is	disagreeable	to	her	and	incapable	of	satisfying	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">sexually. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	 hysteria,	 in	 itself,	 is	 not	 hereditary,	 it,	 nevertheless,	 is	 a	 question whether	 a	 strongly	 hysterical	 woman	 would	 make	 a	 satisfactory	 mother.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">entire	 family	 history	 should	 be	 investigated.	 If	 the	 hysteria	 is	 found	 to	 be	 an isolated	 instance	 in	 the	 given	 girl,	 it	 may	 be	 disregarded,	 if	 not	 extreme;	 but	 if the	 entire	 family	 or	 several	 members	 of	 it	 are	 neuropathic,	 the	 condition	 is	 a dysgenic	one.	Marriage	may	be	contracted,	provided	no	children	are	brought	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	world	until	several	years	have	elapsed	and	the	mother's	organization	seems	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	become	more	stable.	In	some	cases,	a	child	acts	as	a	good	medicine	against</p>
<p class="calibre1">hysteria.	 In	 short,	 every	 case	 must	 be	 examined	 individually	 on	 its	 merits,	 and the	counsel	of	a	good	psychologist	or	psychoanalyst	may	prove	very	valuable. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Alcoholism</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 good	 deal	 depends	 upon	 what	 we	 understand	 by	 alcoholism.	 The	 fanatics</p>
<p class="calibre1">consider	a	person	an	alcoholic	who	drinks	a	glass	of	beer	or	wine	with	his	meals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 is	 nonsense.	 This	 is	 not	 alcoholism,	 and	 cannot	 be	 considered	 a	 dysgenic factor.	 But,	 where	 there	 is	 a	 distinct	 habit,	 so	 that	 the	 individual	  <i class="calibre4">must</i>	 have	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>alcohol	daily,	or	if	he	goes	on	an	occasional	drunken	"spree,"	marriage	must	be advised	against.	And	where	the	man	(or	woman)	is	what	we	call	a	real	drunkard, </p>
<p class="calibre1">marriage	 not	 only	 should	 be	 advised	 against,	 but	 most	 decidedly	 should	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">prohibited	by	law. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alcoholism,	 as	 a	 habit,	 is	 one	 of	 the	 worst	 dysgenic	 factors	 to	 reckon	 with. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First,	 the	 offspring	 is	 liable	 to	 be	 affected,	 which	 is	 sufficient	 in	 itself	 to condemn	marriage	with	an	alcoholic.	Second,	the	earning	powers	of	an	alcoholic</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	 generally	 diminished,	 and	 are	 likely	 gradually	 to	 diminish	 more	 and	 more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Third,	an	alcoholic	is	irritable,	quarrelsome,	and	is	liable	to	do	bodily	injury	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	wife.	Fourth	an	alcoholic	often	develops	sexual	weakness	or	complete	sexual</p>
<p class="calibre1">impotence.	 Fifth,	 alcoholics	 are	 likely	 to	 develop	 extreme	 jealousy,	 which	 may become	pathological,	even	to	the	extent	of	a	psychosis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 both	 the	 husband	 and	 wife	 are	 alcoholics,	 then	 marriage	 between	 them</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	results	in	children	is	not	merely	a	sin,	but	a	crime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	do	not	now	come	across	cases	so	often	as	we	used	to	of	women	marrying</p>
<p class="calibre1">drunkards	 in	 the	 hope	 or	 with	 the	 hope	 of	 reforming	 them.	 But	 such	 cases	 still happen.	This	is	a	very	foolish	procedure.	Let	the	man	reform	first,	let	him	stay</p>
<p class="calibre1">reformed	for	two	or	three	years,	and	then	the	woman	may	take	the	chance,	if	she</p>

<p class="calibre1">Feeblemindedness,	 in	 all	 its	 gradations—including	 idiocy,	 imbecility, </p>
<p class="calibre1">moronism,	 and	 so	 on—is	 strongly	 hereditary	 and	 is	 one	 of	 the	 most	 dysgenic</p>
<p class="calibre1">factors	 we	 have	 to	 deal	 with.	 It	 is	 the	 most	 dysgenic	 of	 all	 factors.	 It	 is	 more dysgenic	than	insanity.	Marriage	with	a	feebleminded	person	not	only	should	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">advised	against,	but	should	be	prohibited	by	law.	A	feebleminded	man	has	much</p>

<p class="calibre1">even	to	the	extent	of	being	morons,	if	pretty	(as	they	often	are)	have	very	good</p>

<p class="calibre1">There	are	many	cases	of	brilliant	men—more	than	the	public	has	any	idea	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">—who	married	pretty,	shy,	demure,	but	withal	feebleminded,	girls,	and	the	result</p>

<p class="calibre1">in	 mind	 that	 feeblemindedness	 or	 weak	 mentality	 is	 much	 more	 difficult	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">detect	in	a	woman	than	it	is	in	a	man.	Weakmindedness	in	a	woman	often	passes</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 "cuteness,"	 and	 as	 among	 the	 conservatives	 a	 woman	 is	 not	 expected	 to	 be able	to	discuss	current	topics,	her	intellectual	caliber	is	often	not	discovered	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	blinded	husband	until	some	weeks	after	the	marriage	ceremony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 any	 instruction	 in	 the	 use	 of	 contraceptives	 would	 be	 wasted	 on	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">feebleminded,	 the	 only	 way	 to	 guard	 the	 race	 against	 pollution	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">feebleminded	stock	is	either	to	segregate	or	to	sterilize	them.	Society	could	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	objection	against	the	feebleminded	marrying	or	indulging	in	sexual	relations, </p>
<p class="calibre1">provided	it	could	be	assured	that	they	will	not	bring	any	feebleminded	stock	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 world.	 After	 the	 man	 and	 the	 woman	 have	 been	 sterilized	 there	 is	 no</p>
<p class="calibre1">objection	to	their	getting	married. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where	 a	 normal,	 able	 or	 brilliant	 husband	 finds	 out	 too	 late	 that	 his	 wife's mentality	is	of	rather	a	low	order	he	is	certainly	justified	in	using	contraceptives; </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	if	he	is	determined	to	have	children	he	will	be	obliged	to	divorce	his	wife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	course	this	applies	also	to	the	wife	of	a	weak	minded	husband. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Insanity</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Insanity	may	be	briefly	defined	as	a	disease	of	the	mind.	We	will	not	here	go</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	a	discussion	as	to	what	constitutes	real	insanity,	as	to	what	is	understood	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">insanity	in	the	legal	sense	of	the	term,	and	so	on,	except	to	note	that	we	have	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">divisions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	is	functional	insanity.	This	may	be	temporary,	or	periodical,	and	is	due	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	external	cause,	is	curable,	and	is	not	hereditary.	For	instance,	a	person	may</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	 insane	 from	 a	 severe	 shock,	 from	 trouble,	 from	 anxiety,	 from	 a	 severe</p>
<p class="calibre1">accident	(such	as	a	shipwreck),	from	a	sudden	and	total	loss	of	his	fortune,	of	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">wife	 and	 children	 (by	 fire,	 earthquake,	 shipwreck	 or	 railroad	 accident).	 Such insanities	 are	 curable	 and	 are	 not	 transmissible.	 Another	 example	 is	 what	 is known	 as	 puerperal	 insanity.	 Some	 women	 during	 childbirth,	 due	 probably	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	toxic	infection,	become	insane.	This	insanity	may	be	extreme	and	maniacal</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	character.	Still,	it	often	passes	away	in	a	few	days	 <i class="calibre4">without	leaving	any	trace</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 may	 never	 return	 again,	 or,	 if	 it	 does	 return,	 it	 may	 return	 only	 during</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a>another	childbirth.	This	kind	of	insanity	is	not	transmissible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	second	division	is	what	we	call	organic	insanity.	This	expresses	itself	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">mania	 and	 melancholy,	 so-called	 manic-depressive	 insanity.	 This	 is	 due	 to	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">degeneration	of	the	brain-and	nerve-tissue	and	is	hereditary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But,	our	entire	conception	as	to	the	hereditary	transmissibility	of	insanity	has</p>
<p class="calibre1">undergone	 a	 radical	 change.	 There	 is	 hardly	 another	 disease	 the	 fear	 of	 whose hereditary	 character	 is	 responsible	 for	 so	 much	 anguish	 and	 torture.	 In	 former years,	when	there	was	an	insane	uncle	or	aunt	or	grandparent	that	fact	weighed</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	 a	 veritable	 incubus	 on	 the	 entire	 family.	 Every	 member	 of	 the	 family	 was tortured	by	the	secret	anguish	that	maybe	he	or	she	would	be	next	to	be	affected</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	 this	 most	 horrible	 of	 all	 diseases—disease	 of	 the	 mind.	 If	 an	 ancestral</p>
<p class="calibre1">member	 of	 the	 family	 became	 insane	 at	 a	 certain	 age,	 every	 member	 of	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">family	was	living	in	fear	and	trembling	until	several	years	had	passed	 <i class="calibre4">after</i>	that critical	 age,	 and	 only	 then	 would	 they	 begin	 to	 breathe	 freely.	 Indeed,	 many people	 became	 insane	 from	 the	 very	 fear	 of	 becoming	 insane.	 It	 cannot	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">subject	to	any	doubt	that	many	people	do	become	mentally	unbalanced	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fear	 that	 they	 will	 become	 unbalanced.	 Fear	 has	 a	 tremendous	 influence	 on	 the purely	 bodily	 functions,	 but	 its	 influence	 on	 the	 mental	 functions	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">incomparably	greater,	and	a	person	will	often	get	that	which	he	fears	he	is	going</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	get. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	 the	 hereditary	 character	 of	 insanity	 is	 not	 taken	 in	 the	 same	 absolute</p>
<p class="calibre1">sense	in	which	it	was	formerly.	While	we	still	consider	it	a	dysgenic	factor,	yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	 recognize	 the	 paramount	 importance	 of	 environment;	 and	 we	 know	 that	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1">proper	 bringing-up,	 using	 the	 expression	 bringing-up	 in	 its	 broadest	 sense—</p>
<p class="calibre1">including	 a	 proper	 mental	 and	 physical	 discipline—any	 hereditary	 taint	 can	 be counteracted.	In	connection	with	this	subject,	the	following	very	recent	statistics</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	prove	of	interest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 families	 of	 558	 insane	 persons	 cared	 for	 in	 the	 London	 county	 asylums</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 investigated,	 and,	 according	 to	 reports	 received	 from	 the	 educational</p>
<p class="calibre1">authorities,	 only	 15	 of	 these	 (less	 than	 3	 per	 cent)	 had	 mentally	 defective children.	As	to	the	time	of	the	birth	of	the	children,	whether	before	or	after	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">attack	 of	 the	 insanity,	 we	 find	 the	 following	 figures:	 56	 out	 of	 573	 parents	 had children	after	their	first	attack	of	insanity,	and	106	children	were	born	after	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">onset	 of	 insanity	 in	 the	 parent;	 while	 the	 remaining	 1259	 children	 were	 born before	the	parent	became	insane. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Altogether,	as	will	be	seen	from	a	discussion	of	the	various	factors	rendering</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>marriage	permissible	or	nonpermissible,	I	am	inclined	to	consider	environment	a more	important	factor	than	heredity.	The	purely	physical	characteristics	bear	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">Addiction	 to	 drugs,	 whether	 it	 be	 opium,	 morphine,	 heroin	 or	 cocaine,	 is	 a</p>

<p class="calibre1">A	 few	 cases	 of	 drug	 addiction	 are	 external;	 that	 is,	 the	 patient	 may	 have	 a good	 healthy	 constitution,	 no	 hereditary	 taint,	 and	 still	 because	 during	 some sickness	 he	 was	 given	 morphine	 a	 number	 of	 times	 he	 may	 have	 developed	 an</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Consanguineous	Marriages</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Consanguinity	 means	 blood	 relationship,	 and	 consanguineous	 marriages	 are</p>
<p class="calibre1">marriages	between	near	blood	relatives.	The	physician	is	frequently	consulted	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	permissibility	or	danger	of	marriages	between	near	relations.	The	question</p>
<p class="calibre1">generally	 concerns	 first	 cousins,	 second	 cousins,	 uncle	 and	 niece,	 and	 nephew and	aunt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 popular	 idea	 is	 that	 consanguineous	 marriages	 are	 bad	  <i class="calibre4">per	 se</i>.	 The children	of	near	relatives,	such	as	first	cousins,	are	apt	to	be	defective,	deaf	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">dumb,	 blind,	 or	 feebleminded,	 and	 what	 not.	 This	 popular	 idea,	 as	 so	 many</p>
<p class="calibre1">popular	ideas	are,	is	wrong.	And	still	there	is	of	course,	as	there	always	is,	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">foundation	for	it.	The	matter,	however,	is	quite	simple. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 know	 that	 many	 traits,	 good	 and	 bad,	 are	 transmitted	 by	 heredity.	 And</p>
<p class="calibre1">naturally	when	traits	are	possessed	by	both	father	and	mother	they	stand	a	much</p>
<p class="calibre1">greater	chance	of	being	transmitted	to	the	offspring	than	if	possessed	by	one	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	parents	alone.	Now	then,	if	a	certain	bad	trait,	such	as	epilepsy	or	insanity,	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">present	 in	 a	 family	 that	 trait	 is	 present	 in	 both	 cousins,	 and	 the	 likelihood	 of children	from	such	a	marriage	inheriting	that	trait	is	much	greater	than	when	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">parents	 are	 strangers,	 the	 taint	 being	 present	 in	 the	 family	 of	 only	 one	 of	 the parents.	But	if	there	be	no	hereditary	taint	in	the	cousins'	family,	and,	still	more, </p>
<p class="calibre1">if	the	family	is	an	intelligent	one,	if	there	are	geniuses	in	the	family,	then	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">cannot	be	the	 slightest	objection	to	 marriage	between	cousins,	 and	the	 children</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 such	 marriages	 are	 apt	 to	 inherit	 in	 a	 strong	 degree	 the	 talents	 or	 genius	 of their	ancestors.	In	short,	if	the	family	is	a	bad	one,	one	below	par,	then	marriage</p>
<p class="calibre1">between	cousins	or	between	uncle	and	niece	should	be	forbidden.	If	the	family	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	good	one,	above	par,	then	marriage	between	relatives	of	that	family	should	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">encouraged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 idea	 that	 the	 children	 from	 consanguineous	 marriages	 are	 apt	 to	 be	 deaf and	 dumb	 has	 no	 foundation	 in	 fact.	 Recent	 statistics	 from	 various	 asylums	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a>Germany,	for	instance,	have	shown	that	only	about	five	per	cent.	of	the	deaf	and dumb	children	were	the	offspring	of	consanguineous	marriages.	If	95	per	cent,	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 deaf	 and	 dumb	 had	  <i class="calibre4">non</i>-consanguineous	 parents,	 how	 could	 one	 say	 that even	 in	 the	 other	 five	 per	 cent,	 the	 consanguinity	 was	 the	 cause?	 If	 it	 were	 the other	way	around,	then	of	course	we	could	blame	consanguinity.	As	it	is,	we	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">assume	even	in	this	five	per	cent,	a	mere	coincidence,	and	we	have	no	right	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">say	that	consanguinity	and	deaf	and	dumbness	stand	in	the	relation	to	each	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	cause	and	effect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	interesting	to	know	that	among	the	Egyptians,	Persians,	and	Incas	of	Peru</p>
<p class="calibre1">close	 consanguineous	 marriages	 were	 very	 common.	 The	 Egyptian	 kings</p>
<p class="calibre1">generally	 married	 their	 sisters.	 This	 was	 common	 custom	 and	 if	 the	 children</p>
<p class="calibre1">born	 of	 such	 unions	 were	 defectives	 or	 monstrosities	 the	 fact	 would	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">become	quickly	apparent	and	the	custom	would	have	been	abolished.	Evidently</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	offspring	of	very	close	consanguinity	was	normal,	or	even	above	normal,	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	practice	would	not	have	been	continued	such	a	long	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 is	 perhaps	 worth	 while	 noting	 that	 one	 of	 the	 world's	 greatest	 scientists, Charles	Darwin,	was	the	child	of	parents	who	were	first	cousins. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Homosexuality</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Homosexuality	 (homos—the	 same)	 is	 a	 perversion	 in	 which	 a	 person	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">attracted	 not	 to	 persons	 of	 the	 opposite	 but	 to	 persons	 of	 the	 same	 sex.	 Thus	 a homosexual	 man	 does	 not	 care	 for	 women,	 but	 is	 attracted	 to	 men.	 A</p>
<p class="calibre1">homosexual	woman	is	not	attracted	to	men;	she	only	cares	for	women	and	may</p>
<p class="calibre1">even	 loathe	 men.	 A	 homosexual,	 man	 or	 woman,	 has	 no	 right	 to	 marry.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrong	committed	by	a	homosexual	marrying	is	a	double	one:	it	is	wrong	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">partner,	 wrong	 to	 the	 children.	 The	 normal	 partner	 is	 bound	 to	 discover	 the abnormality,	and	if	he	(or	she)	does,	then	the	married	life	is	a	very	unhappy	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	if	the	abnormal	partner	uses	the	utmost	efforts	to	conceal	the	abnormality, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 cannot	 afford	 any	 pleasure	 to	 the	 normal	 partner,	 because	 the	 sexual	 act committed	under	loathing	cannot	be	satisfactory.	The	other	wrong	is	committed</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 the	 offspring.	 Homosexuality	 is	 hereditary,	 and	 nobody	 has	 a	 right	 to	 bring homosexuals	into	the	world,	for	there	is	no	unhappier	being	than	a	homosexual.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">know	a	homosexual	woman,	who,	knowing	her	abnormality,	married	for	the	sake</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	a	comfortable	home.	She	has	been	successful	in	hiding	from	her	husband	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">abnormality,	 he	 simply	 considering	 her	 frigid.	 But	 each	 sexual	 act	 costs	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>tortures.	 So	 far	 she	 has	 succeeded	 in	 avoiding	 pregnancy.	 I	 also	 know	 a	 highly refined	and	educated	homosexual	gentleman,	who	married	before	understanding</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 condition.	 Many	 homosexuals,	 not	 knowing	 that	 such	 a	 thing	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">homosexuality	 even	 exists,	 do	 not	 understand	 their	 own	 condition;	 they	 feel	 a little	strange,	a	little	puzzled,	but	they	don't	know	that	they	ought	not	to	marry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon	after	marrying	his	condition	became	clear	to	him,	but	in	the	meantime	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">wife	 conceived,	 and	 he	 is	 now	 the	 father	 of	 a	 healthy,	 good-looking	 boy.	 It	 is possible	that	with	proper	bringing	up	the	development	of	any	homosexual	traits</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	 be	 prevented.	 It	 should	 be	 borne	 in	 mind	 that	 long	 sexual	 repression	 is favorable	to	the	development	of	homosexuality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 to	 emphasize:	 homosexuality	 is	 a	 dysgenic	 factor,	 and	 no	 homosexual</p>
<p class="calibre1">should	marry. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Sadism</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sadism	is	a	sexual	perversion	in	which	the	person	derives	pleasure	only	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">beating,	 biting,	 striking,	 or	 otherwise	 inflicting	 pain	 on	 the	 person	 of	 the opposite	 sex.	 The	 degree	 of	 cruelty	 varies,	 but	 all	 sadists	 should	 be	 shunned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately	 the	 fact	 that	 a	 man	 is	 a	 sadist	 is	 often	 not	 found	 out	 until	 after marriage,	but	as	soon	as	the	wife	has	found	it	out	she	should	leave	the	man	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">demand	a	divorce.	Sadism	is	a	sufficient	ground	for	a	separation	or	divorce.	No</p>
<p class="calibre1">person	with	any	moral	feeling	in	him	or	her	should	be	responsible	for	bringing</p>
<p class="calibre1">children	into	the	world	with	a	possible	sadistic	heredity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sadistic	cruelty	is	often	of	the	gross,	brutal,	repulsive	kind,	but	sometimes	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sadist	 inflicts	 on	 his	 "beloved"	 object	 refined	 tortures	 of	 which	 only	 a	 cunning</p>
<p class="calibre1">"demon"	 is	 capable.	 The	 sufferings	 which	 the	 wives	 of	 some	 sadists	 have	 to undergo	are	known	only	to	themselves	and	to	a	few—very	few—physicians. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Masochism</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Masochism	is	a	sexual	perversion	in	which	the	person,	man	or	woman,  <i class="calibre4">likes</i>	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">suffer	 pain,	 beatings,	 insults	 and	 other	 cruelties	 at	 the	 hands	 of	 the	 beloved object.	It	is	a	dysgenic	factor	but	much	less	important	than	sadism. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a><b class="calibre3">Sexual	Impotence</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sexual	 impotence	 is	 not	 hereditary,	 but	 impotence	 in	 the	 male	 either	 so</p>
<p class="calibre1">complete	 that	 he	 cannot	 perform	 the	 act	 or	 consisting	 only	 in	 premature</p>
<p class="calibre1">ejaculations	(relative	impotence	or	sexual	insufficiency)	should	constitute	a	bar</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	marriage.	This	impotence	may	not	interfere	with	impregnation;	the	wife	may</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 children	 and	 the	 children	 will	 not	 be	 in	 any	 way	 defective,	 but	 the	 wife herself,	unless	she	is	completely	frigid,	will	suffer	the	tortures	of	hell,	and	may</p>
<p class="calibre1">quickly	 become	 a	 sexual	 neurasthenic,	 a	 nervous	 wreck,	 or	 she	 may	 even</p>
<p class="calibre1">develop	 a	 psychosis.	 Any	 man	 suffering	 with	 impotence	 should	 have	 himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">treated	before	marriage	until	he	is	cured;	if	his	impotence	is	incurable,	then	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 own	 sake	 and	 for	 the	 sake	 of	 the	 girl	 or	 woman	 he	 is	 supposed	 to	 love	 he should	give	up	the	idea	of	marriage.	The	only	permissible	exception	is	in	cases</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 which	 the	 prospective	 wife	 knows	 the	 nature	 of	 her	 prospective	 husband's</p>
<p class="calibre1">trouble,	and	claims	that	she	does	not	care	for	gross	sexual	relations	and	therefore</p>
<p class="calibre1">does	not	mind	the	impotence.	In	case	the	wife	is	absolutely	 <i class="calibre4">frigid</i>,	the	marriage may	 turn	 out	 satisfactory.	 But	 I	 would	 always	 have	 my	 misgivings,	 and	 should the	wife's	apparently	absent	but	in	reality	only	dormant	libido	suddenly	awaken</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	 would	 be	 trouble	 for	 both	 husband	 and	 wife.	 It	 is	 therefore	 necessary	 to emphasize:	in	all	cases	of	impotence—caution! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Frigidity</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Frigidity,	as	we	have	explained	in	a	previous	chapter,	is	a	term	applied	to	lack</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	sexual	desire	or	sexual	enjoyment	in	women.	Of	course	many	women	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">marriage	 are	 themselves	 ignorant	 of	 their	 sexual	 condition.	 Having	 learned	 to restrain	 their	 impulses,	 to	 repress	 any	 sexual	 stir,	 they	 themselves	 are	 often unable	 to	 say	 whether	 they	 have	 a	 strong	 or	 weak	 libido,	 or	 any	 at	 all.	 And whether	or	no	a	given	woman	would	derive	any	pleasure	from	the	sexual	act	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	be	found	out	after	marriage.	Many	girls,	however,	know	very	well	whether</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	are	"passionate"	or	not,	but	they	wouldn't	tell.	They	are	afraid	to	confess	to a	complete	lack	of	passion—they	fear	they	might	lose	a	husband. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Frigidity	as	an	agent	in	marriage	may	be	considered	from	two	points	of	view:</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 offspring	 and	 the	 husband.	 The	 offspring	 is	 not	 affected	 by	 the	 mother's frigidity.	 A	 very	 frigid	 woman,	 if	 the	 frigidity	 is	 not	 due	 to	 serious	 organic causes,	may	have	very	healthy	children	and	make	an	excellent	mother.	As	far	as</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a>the	husband	is	concerned,	it	will	depend	a	good	deal	on	the	degree	of	frigidity.	If the	 woman	 is	 merely	 cold,	 and,	 while	 herself	 not	 enjoying	 the	 act,	 raises	 no objection	to	it,	then	it	cannot	be	considered	a	bar	to	marriage.	In	fact	many	men, </p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves	 not	 overstrong	 sexually,	 are	 praying	 for	 somewhat	 frigid	 wives.	 (It must	 be	 stated,	 however,	 that	 to	 some	 husbands	 relations	 with	 frigid	 and	 non-participating	wives	are	extremely	distasteful.)	But	when	the	frigidity	is	of	such	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">degree	 that	 it	 amounts	 to	 a	 strong	 physical	 aversion	 to	 the	 act,	 it	 should	 be considered	 a	 bar	 to	 marriage.	 Such	 frigidity	 is	 often	 the	 cause	 of	 a	 disrupted home,	 often	 leads	 to	 divorce	 and	 is	 legally	 considered	 a	 sufficient	 cause	 for divorce	or	for	the	annulment	of	marriage,	the	same	as	impotence	in	the	man	is. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Excessive	Libido	in	Men</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">We	have	seen	that	sexual	impotence	is	a	dysgenic	factor	and	if	complete	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">incurable	should	constitute	a	barrier	to	marriage.	The	opposite	condition	is	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	excessive	libido.	Libido	is	the	desire	for	the	opposite	sex.	A	proper	amount	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">libido	 is	 normal	 and	 desirable.	 A	 lack	 of	 libido	 is	 abnormal.	 And	 an	 excess	 of libido	 is	 also	 abnormal.	 But	 a	 good	 many	 men	 are	 possessed	 of	 an	 excess	 of libido;	 it	 is	 either	 congenital	 or	  <i class="calibre4">acquired</i>.	 Some	 men	 torture	 their	 wives	 "to death,"	not	literally	but	figuratively.	Harboring	the	prevailing	idea	that	a	wife	has no	rights	in	this	respect,	that	her	body	is	not	her	own,	that	she	must	always	hold</p>
<p class="calibre1">herself	 ready	 to	 satisfy	 his	 abnormal	 desires,	 such	 a	 husband	 exercises	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">marital	 rights	 without	 consideration	 for	 the	 physical	 condition	 or	 the	 mental feelings	 of	 his	 partner.	 Some	 husbands	 demand	 that	 their	 wives	 satisfy	 them</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">daily</i>	 from	 one	 to	 five	 or	 more	 times	 a	 day.	 Some	 wives	 who	 happen	 to	 be possessed	 of	 an	 equally	 strong	 libido	 do	 not	 mind	 these	 excessive	 demands</p>
<p class="calibre1">(though	 in	 time	 they	 are	 almost	 sure	 to	 feel	 the	 evil	 effects),	 but	 if	 the	 wife possesses	 only	 a	 moderate	 amount	 of	 sexuality	 and	 if	 she	 is	 too	 weak	 in	 body and	 in	 will-power	 to	 resist	 her	 lord	 and	 master's	 demands,	 her	 health	 is	 often ruined	 and	 she	 becomes	 a	 wreck.	 (Complete	 abstinence	 and	 excessive</p>
<p class="calibre1">indulgence	 often	 have	 the	 same	 evil	 end-results.)	 Some	 men	 "kill"	 four	 or	 five women	before	the	fury	of	their	libido	is	at	last	moderated.	Of	course,	it	is	hard	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">find	out	a	man's	libido	beforehand.	But	if	a	delicate	girl	or	a	woman	of	moderate</p>
<p class="calibre1">sexuality	 has	 reasons	 to	 suspect	 that	 a	 man	 is	 possessed	 of	 an	 abnormally</p>
<p class="calibre1">excessive	 libido,	 she	 would	 do	 well	 to	 think	 twice	 before	 taking	 the	 often</p>
<p class="calibre1">irretrievable	step. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>I	have	spoken	so	far	of	excessive	libido	in	normal	men,	that	is,	in	men	who	are otherwise	normal,	sane	and	can	 <i class="calibre4">whenever	necessary</i>	control	their	desires.	There</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 a	 form	 of	 excessive	 libido	 in	 men	 called	 satyriasis,	 which	 reaches	 such	 a degree	 that	 the	 men	 are	 often	 not	 able	 to	 control	 their	 desires,	 and	 they	 will satisfy	 their	 passion	 even	 if	 they	 know	 that	 the	 result	 is	 sure	 to	 be	 a	 venereal infection	 or	 several	 years	 in	 prison.	 Of	 course,	 satyriasis	 is	 a	 dysgenic	 factor; those	suffering	with	that	disorder	are	not	normal;	they	are	on	the	borderland	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">insanity,	and	not	only	should	they	not	be	permitted	to	marry,	but	they	should	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">confined	to	institutions	where	they	can	be	subjected	to	the	proper	treatment. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Excessive	Libido	in	Women</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	 as	 we	 have	 impotent	 and	 excessively	 libidinous	 men,	 so	 we	 have	 frigid</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 excessively	 libidinous	 women.	 A	 wife	 possessed	 of	 excessive	 libido	 is	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">terrible	 calamity	 for	 a	 husband	 of	 a	 normal	 or	 moderate	 sexuality.	 Many	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">libidinous	wife	has	driven	her	husband,	especially	if	she	is	young	and	he	is	old, </p>
<p class="calibre1">to	a	premature	grave.	And	"grave"	is	used	in	the	literal,	not	figurative,	sense	of the	word.	It	would	be	a	good	thing	if	a	man	could	find	out	the	character	of	his</p>

<p class="calibre1">Almost	 a	 complete	 change	 has	 taken	 place	 in	 our	 ideas	 of	 criminality,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	 are	 but	 very	 few	 criminologists	 now	 who	 believe	 in	 the	 Lombrosian</p>
<p class="calibre1">nonsense	of	most	criminality	being	inherited	and	being	accompanied	by	physical</p>
<p class="calibre1">stigmata	of	degeneration.	The	idea	that	the	criminal	is	born	and	not	made	is	now</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>held	only	by	an	insignificant	number	of	thinkers.	We	know	now	that	by	far	the greatest	percentage	of	crime	is	the	result	of	environment,	of	poverty,	with	all	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 word	 implies,	 of	 bad	 bringing	 up,	 of	 bad	 companions.	 We	 know	 that	 the child	of	the	criminal,	properly	brought	up,	will	develop	into	a	model	citizen,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">vice	 versa,	 the	 child	 of	 the	 saint,	 brought	 into	 the	 slums,	 might	 develop	 into	 a criminal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	we	must	remember	that	there	are	many	crimes	which	are	not	crimes,	per</p>
<p class="calibre1">se,	 but	 which	 are	 merely	 infractions	 of	 man-made	 laws,	 or	 representing</p>
<p class="calibre1">rebellious	acts	against	an	unjust	and	cruel	social	order.	Thus,	for	instance,	a	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	 a	 woman	 who	 defying	 the	 law,	 would	 give	 information	 about	 birth	 control, and	be	convicted	for	the	offence,	would	be	legally	a	criminal.	Morally	he	or	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	be	a	high-minded	humanitarian.	A	man	who	would	throw	a	bomb	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Russian	 Czar	 or	 at	 a	 murderous	 pogrom-inciting	 Russian	 Governor	 would	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">considered	 an	 assassin,	 and	 if	 caught	 would	 be	 hanged;	 and	 in	 making	 up	 the pedigree	 of	 such	 a	 family,	 a	 narrow-minded	 eugenist	 would	 be	 apt	 to	 say	 that there	was	criminality	in	that	family.	But	as	a	matter	of	fact,	that	"assassin"	may have	belonged	to	the	noblest-minded	heroes	in	history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 eugenists	 will	 therefore	 pay	 little	 attention	 to	 criminality	 in	 the	 ancestry as	 a	 dysgenic	 factor.	 As	 long	 as	 the	 matrimonial	 candidate	 himself	 is	 not	 a criminal,	the	ancestral	criminality	should	constitute	no	bar	to	the	marriage.	It	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 likely	 to	 show	 itself	 atavistically	 in	 the	 children.	 Altogether	 a	 good	 deal	 of nonsense	has	been	written	about	atavism.	And	people	forget	that	the	same	rules</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	heredity	that	are	applied	to	physical	conditions	cannot	be	applied	to	spiritual</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 moral	 qualities,	 the	 latter	 being	 much	 more	 dependent	 upon	 environment</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	 the	 former.	 Of	 course	 the	 various	 circumstances	 must	 be	 taken	 into</p>
<p class="calibre1">consideration,	and	each	case	must	be	decided	upon	its	merits.	No	generalizations</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	be	permitted.	The	 <i class="calibre4">kind</i>	of	crime	must	always	be	considered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And,	 furthermore,	 it	 should	 be	 borne	 in	 mind	 that	 not	 only	 is	 a	 criminal</p>
<p class="calibre1">ancestry	 <i class="calibre4">per	se</i>	no	bar	to	marriage,	the	marriage	candidate	himself	may	be	an	ex-criminal,	may	have	served	time	in	prison,	and	still	be	a	very	desirable	father	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother	 from	 the	 eugenic	 viewpoint.	 A	 man	 who	 in	 a	 fit	 of	 passion	 or	 during	 a quarrel,	perhaps	under	the	slight	influence	of	liquor,	struck	or	killed	a	man	is	not, </p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore,	 a	 real	 criminal.	 After	 serving	 his	 time	 in	 prison	 he	 may	 never	 again commit	 the	 slightest	 antisocial	 act,	 may	 make	 a	 moral	 citizen	 and	 an	 ideal</p>
<p class="calibre1">husband	and	father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	is	not	a	plea	for	the	under	dog.	For	in	this	case,	where	the	future	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">race	 is	 at	 stake,	 all	 other	 considerations	 must	 be	 put	 into	 the	 background.	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a>simply	 plead	 for	 an	 intelligent	 consideration	 of	 the	 subject.	 Many	 honored citizens	 are	 worse	 criminals	 and	 worse	 fathers	 than	 many	 people	 who	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">served	prison	sentences. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Pauperism</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It	may	seem	strange	to	discuss	pauperism	in	relation	to	marriage	and	to	speak</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	it	as	a	hereditary	factor,	but	it	is	necessary	to	discuss	it,	because	considerable</p>
<p class="calibre1">ignorance	 prevails	 on	 the	 subject,	 it	 being	 generally	 confused	 with	 poverty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 is	 a	 radical	 difference	 between	 pauperism	 and	 poverty.	 People	 may	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">poor	for	generations	and	generations,	even	very	poor,	and	still	not	be	considered</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	 classed	 with	 paupers.	 Pauperism	 generally	 implies	 a	 lack	 of	 physical	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">mental	 stamina,	 loss	 of	  <i class="calibre4">self-respect</i>	 and	 unconquerable	 laziness.	 Of	 course	 we know	now	that	laziness	often	rests	upon	a	physical	basis,	being	due	to	imperfect</p>
<p class="calibre1">working	 of	 the	 internal	 glands.	 But	 whatever	 the	 cause	 of	 the	 laziness	 may	 be, the	fact	is	that	it	is	one	of	the	characteristics	of	the	pauper.	And	while	we	cannot</p>
<p class="calibre1">speak	of	pauperism	being	hereditary,	the	qualities	that	go	to	make	up	the	pauper</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	transmissible.	No	normal	woman	would	marry	a	pauper,	and	the	woman	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	marry	a	pauper	is	not	amenable	to	any	advice	or	to	any	book	knowledge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	men	are	sometimes	tempted	to	marry	daughters	of	paupers	if	they	happen	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 pretty.	 They	 should	 consider	 the	 matter	 very	 carefully,	 for	 some	 of	 the</p>

<p class="calibre1">In	spite	of	the	fact	that	the	subject	of	birth	control	is	much	better	known	now</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	it	was	when	we	first	started	to	propagate	it,	still	it	cannot	be	mentioned	too</p>
<p class="calibre1">often,	 for	 the	 misapprehensions	 concerning	 it	 almost	 keep	 pace	 with	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">propaganda.	 First,	 there	 is	 a	 foolish	 notion	 that	 we	 would	 try	 to	 regulate	 the number	 of	 children	 forcibly,	 that	 we	 would	 compel	 people	 to	 have	 a	 small</p>
<p class="calibre1">number	 of	 children.	 Nothing	 could	 apparently	 be	 more	 absurd,	 and	 still	 many</p>
<p class="calibre1">people	 sincerely	 believe	 it.	 Nothing	 is	 further	 from	 the	 truth.	 On	 the	 contrary, much	as	we	are	in	favor	of	birth	control,	we	advise	limitation	of	offspring	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	those	who	for	various	reasons,	financial,	hereditary	or	hygienic,	are	unable	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	many	children.	We	emphatically	believe	that	couples	who	are	in	excellent</p>
<p class="calibre1">health,	who	are	of	untainted	heredity,	who	are	fit	to	bring	up	children,	and	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 means	 to	 do	 so,	 should	 have	 at	 least	 half	 a	 dozen	 children.	 If	 they	 should have	one	dozen,	they	would	deserve	the	thanks	of	the	community.	All	we	claim</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 that	 in	 such	 an	 important	 matter	 as	 bringing	 children	 into	 the	 world,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>parents	 who	 have	 to	 carry	 the	 full	 burden	 of	 bringing	 up	 these	 children	 should have	the	right	to	decide.	They	should	have	the	means	of	control.	They	should	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">able	to	say	whether	they	will	have	two	or	six	or	one	dozen	children. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Contraceptive	Measures</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">And	the	argument	that	contraceptives	are	injurious	to	the	health	of	the	woman, </p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 man,	 or	 of	 both,	 may	 be	 curtly	 dismissed.	 It	 is	 not	 true	 of	 any	 of	 the modern	contraceptives.	But	even	if	it	were	true,	the	amount	of	injury	that	can	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">done	 by	 contraceptives	 would	 be	 like	 a	 drop	 of	 water	 in	 comparison	 with	 the injuries	 resulting	 from	 excessive	 pregnancies	 and	 childbirths.	 Some	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">contraceptive	 measures	 require	 some	 trouble	 to	 use,	 some	 are	 unesthetic,	 but</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	are	trifles	and	constitute	a	small	price	to	pay	for	the	privilege	of	being	able</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	regulate	the	number	of	one's	offspring	according	to	one's	intelligent	desires. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 commonest	 argument	 now	 made	 against	 contraceptives	 is	 that	 they	 are</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 absolutely	 safe,	 that	 is,	 absolutely	 to	 be	 relied	 upon,	 that	 they	 will	 not prevent	in	absolutely	every	case.	This	is	true;	but	there	are	three	answers	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">render	this	objection	invalid.	First,	many	of	the	cases	of	failure	are	to	be	ascribed</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 to	 the	 contraceptives	 themselves,	 but	 to	 their	 improper,	 careless	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">unintelligent	 use.	 The	 best	 methods	 in	 the	 world	 will	 fail	 if	 used	 improperly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Second,	if	the	measures	are	efficient	in	98	or	99	per	cent,	and	fail	in	one	or	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">per	cent.,	then	they	are	a	blessing.	Some	women	would	be	the	happiest	women</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 world	 if	 they	 could	 render	 98	 per	 cent.	 of	 their	 conjugal	 relations unfruitful.	Third,	the	imperfections	of	our	contraceptive	measures	are	due	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">secrecy	 with	 which	 the	 entire	 subject	 must	 necessarily	 be	 surrounded.	 If	 the subject	 of	 birth	 control	 could	 be	 fully	 discussed	 in	 medical	 books	 there	 is	 no doubt	 that	 in	 a	 short	 time	 we	 would	 have	 measures	 that	 would	 be	 absolutely certain	 and	 would	 leave	 nothing	 to	 be	 desired.	 But	 even	 such	 as	 they	 are,	 the measures	are	better	than	none,	and	as	said	in	the	beginning	of	this	chapter,	it	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 duty	 of	 every	 young	 woman	 to	 acquire	 as	 one	 of	 the	 items	 of	 her	 sex</p>
<p class="calibre1">education	 the	 knowledge	 of	 how	 to	 avoid	 too	 frequent	 pregnancies.	 In	 fact,	 I consider	this	the	most	important	item	in	a	woman's	sex	education,	and	if	she	has</p>
<p class="calibre1">learned	 nothing	 else	 she	 should	 learn	 this.	 For	 this	 information	 is	  <i class="calibre4">absolutely</i> necessary	to	her	future	health	and	happiness. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In	my	twenty	years'	work	for	the	cause	of	rational	birth	control	I	have	come	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">contact	 with	 thousands	 and	 thousands	 of	 cases	 which	 demonstrate	 in	 the	 most</p>
<p class="calibre1">convincing	 manner	 possible	 the	 tragic	 results	 of	 forced	 or	 undesired</p>
<p class="calibre1">motherhood,	and	of	the	fear	of	forced	or	undesired	motherhood. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Case	1. </i>	This	class	of	case	is	so	common	that	I	almost	feel	like	apologizing	for referring	to	it.	She,	whom	I	will	call	by	the	forbearing	name	of	Mrs.	Smith,	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 married	 a	 little	 over	 nine	 years,	 and	 had	 given	 birth	 to	 five	 children.	 She was	an	excellent	mother,	nursed	them	herself,	took	good	care	of	them,	and	all	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">And	the	fear	of	another	pregnancy	became	an	obsession	with	her.	She	dreamed</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 it	 at	 night,	 and	 it	 poisoned	 her	 waking	 hours	 in	 the	 day.	 She	 felt	 that	 she simply	 could	 not	 go	 through	 another	 pregnancy,	 another	 childbirth,	 with	 its</p>

<p class="calibre1">essential	 difference	 between	 prevention	 and	 abortion,	 between	 refraining	 from</p>
<p class="calibre1">creating	life	and	destroying	life	already	 created;	 we	 must	 show	 the	 viciousness</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>of	 meting	 out	 the	 same	 punishment	 for	 two	 things	 which	 are	 fundamentally different,	different	not	only	in	degree	but	in	kind—and	it	is	only	by	thus	keeping</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	two	things	apart,	by	showing	that	we	stand	for	one	thing—prevention—and</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 for	 the	 other—abortion,	 that	 we	 can	 ever	 gain	 the	 general	 sympathy	 of	 the public	 and	 the	 co-operation	 of	 the	 legislators.	 I	 do	 not	 say	 that	 there	 are	 not many	 cases	 in	 which	 the	 induction	 of	 abortion	 is	 not	 only	 justifiable,	 but</p>

<p class="calibre1">egotistic	 that	 their	 personal	 pleasure	 is	 their	 only	 guide	 of	 conduct.	 They	 will pester	you.	Some	will	lyingly	claim	that	they	are	in	love	with	you;	some	perhaps</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	 sincerely	 believe	 that	 they	 are	 in	 love	 with	 you,	 mistaking	 a	 temporary passion	for	the	sacred	feeling	of	love.	Some	will	even	promise	to	marry	you—</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	 making	 the	 promise	 in	 sincerity,	 others	 with	 the	 deliberate	 intent	 to</p>

<p class="calibre1">and	that	there	is	nothing	wrong	in	sexual	relations.	In	short,	all	ways	and	means</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	be	employed	by	those	men	to	induce	you	to	enter	into	sexual	relations	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Don't	you	do	it! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	am	not	preaching	or	sermonizing	to	you.	I	am	not	appealing	to	your	religion</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	 your	 morals.	 For	 if	 you	 have	 strong	 religious	 or	 moral	 ideas	 against	 illicit sexual	 relations,	 you	 are	 not	 in	 need	 of	 mine	 or	 anybody	 else's	 advice.	 But	 I assume	 that	 you	 are	 a	 more	 or	 less	 modern	 girl,	 with	 little	 or	 no	 religious bringing-up,	or	perhaps	a	radical	girl,	who	has	shaken	off	the	shackles	of	religion</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 tradition.	 And	 to	 you	 I	 say:	  <i class="calibre4">Don't	 you	 do	 it</i>.	 Why?	 Because	 your	 welfare, your	future	happiness,	is	at	stake.	I	am	speaking	from	the	point	of	view	of	your</p>
<p class="calibre1">own	 good,	 and	 from	 that	 point	 of	 view	 I	 say:	 Resist	 all	 attempts	 which	 men make	exclusively	for	the	purpose	of	satisfying	their	sexual	desire,	their	lust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	 will	 ask	 again,	 why?	 For	 several	 reasons.	 First,	 you	 run	 the	 risk	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">venereal	infection.	The	danger	is	not	so	great	now	as	in	former	times,	but	is	great</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough.	 There	 are	 still	 plenty	 of	 men	 dishonest	 enough	 to	 indulge	 in	 sexual relations	with	a	woman	when	they	know	they	are	not	radically	cured.	The	same</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	who	will	not	get	married	unless	he	is	sure	that	he	is	perfectly	cured	will	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">hesitate	 to	 subject	 a	 transient	 girl	 or	 woman	 to	 the	 risk	 of	 venereal	 infection.	 I know	 personally,	 because	 I	 have	 treated	 them;	 yes,	 I	 treated	 several	 intelligent and	radical	young	men	who	infected	young	girls.	And	some	of	these	girls	in	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">turn,	 through	 ignorance	 and	 innocence,	 infected	 other	 men.	 So	 then,	 the	 first danger	is	the	danger	of	venereal	infection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	second	danger,	still	greater	and	more	certain	than	the	first,	is	the	danger	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">impregnation.	 And	 pregnancy	 for	 a	 girl	 under	 our	 present	 moral	 and	 social-</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic	conditions	is	a	terrible	calamity.	She	is	ostracized	everywhere,	and	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">means,	 if	 discovered,	 her	 social	 death.	 But	 you	 will	 say:	 "Aren't	 there	 any remedies	that	can	be	used	to	prevent	conception?	Aren't	you	yourself	among	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a>world's	 chief	 birth-controllers;	 one	 of	 the	 world's	 chief	 advocates	 of	 the	 use	 of contraceptives?"	 Yes,	 my	 dear	 young	 lady,	 but	 I	 never	 made	 the	 claim	 that	 the contraceptives	were	 <i class="calibre4">absolutely</i>	infallible,	I	never	claimed	that	they	were	 <i class="calibre4">100	per</i> <i class="calibre4">cent. </i>	effective	in	 <i class="calibre4">100	per	cent. </i>	of	 <i class="calibre4">all</i>	cases.	But	if	they	are	effective	999	times	or even	990	times	in	every	1000	they	are	a	blessing.	And	thousands	of	families	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">consider	 them.	 And	 if	 a	 married	 woman	 gets	 caught	 once	 in	 a	 while,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">misfortune	is	not	so	great.	But	if	the	accident	happens	to	a	non-married	woman, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	misfortune	 <i class="calibre4">is</i>	great.	Then	again,	you	want	to	bear	in	mind	that	accidents	are less	 likely	 to	 happen	 to	 married	 than	 to	 non-married	 women.	 The	 married</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman	 has	 no	 fear,	 needs	 no	 secrecy,	 and	 she	 can	 go	 about	 the	 method	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">preparation	carefully,	with	deliberation.	The	unmarried	girl,  <i class="calibre4">as	a	rule</i>,	has	not	the proper	 conveniences,	 more	 or	 less	 secrecy	 must	 be	 maintained,	 hurry	 is	 not</p>
<p class="calibre1">infrequently	necessary,	and	that	is	why	accidents	are	more	apt	to	occur	in	spite	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	use	of	contraceptives.	So	then,	the	second	danger,	even	more	sinister	than	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">first,	is	the	danger	of	pregnancy.	"But	if	a	misfortune	happens,	can	I	not	have	an abortion	produced?"	No,	not	always.	Physicians	willing	to	induce	an	abortion	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	found	on	every	corner.	But	this	is	not	the	principal	point.	What	I	have	to	say</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	subject,	I	will	say	later	on	in	this	chapter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 it	 is	 well	 for	 you	 to	 bear	 in	 mind	 that	 those	 very	 men	 who	 use	 their utmost	 efforts,	 who	 strain	 every	 fibre	 and	 every	 nerve	 to	 get	 you,	 will	 despise you	and	detest	you	as	soon	as	they	have	succeeded	in	making	you	yield	to	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">wishes.	 This	 is	 one	 of	 the	 worst	 blots	 on	 the	 male	 man's	 character,	 a	 blot	 from which	 the	 female	 character	 is	 entirely	 free.	 And	 some	 men—fortunately	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1">number	is	not	very	large—are	such	moral	skunks	that	they	take	morbid	pleasure</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	boasting	publicly	of	their	sexual	conquests,	and	unscrupulously	peddle	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 name	 of	 the	 girl	 whom,	 by	 cunning	 false	 promises	 or	 other	 means,	 they</p>
<p class="calibre1">succeeded	in	seducing.	And	of	course	such	a	girl	finds	it	difficult	or	impossible</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	get	married,	and	must	end	her	days	in	solitude,	without	the	hope	of	a	home	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	the	above	reasons	I	advise	you	earnestly	and	sincerely	not	to	yield	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">solicitations	of	thoughtless	or	unscrupulous	men,	who	think	of	nothing	but	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">coarse	 sensual	 pleasures.	 It	 is	 advice	 dictated	 by	 common	 sense,	 by	 your	 own deeper	interest,	aside	from	any	religious	or	moral	considerations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	above	advice,	or	call	it	sermon	if	you	will,	is	meant	principally	for	young</p>
<p class="calibre1">girls,	girls	between	the	ages	of	eighteen	and	twenty-five.	If	a	girl	has	reached	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">age	of	twenty-eight	or	thirty	and	is	willing	to	enter	upon	illicit	sexual	relations</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	her	eyes	open,	with	a	full	knowledge	of	the	possible	consequences,	then	it</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a>is	her	affair,	and	nobody	shall	say	her	nay.	Nobody	has	a	right	to	interfere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nor	 should	 my	 advice	 be	 understood	 as	 directed	 to	 cases	 where	 there	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">sincere	 reciprocal	 affection	 and	 a	 mutual	 understanding.	 This	 is	 an	 entirely</p>
<p class="calibre1">different	matter,	and	has	nothing	to	do	with	cases	where	the	man	is	the	pursuer</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	seducer	and	the	woman	an	unwilling	or	reluctant	victim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	whatever	the	relations	between	the	man	and	the	girl	may	be,	whether	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">yielded	in	a	fit	of	passion,	or	was	seduced	by	false	promises,	by	"moral"	suasion, by	hypnotic	influence	or	by	the	vulgar	method	of	being	made	drunk,	what	is	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	do	if	she	finds	herself,	to	her	horror,	in	a	pregnant	condition?	There	are	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">ways	 open	 to	 her:	 either	 let	 the	 pregnancy	 go	 to	 term	 or	 to	 have	 an	 abortion brought	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	she	lets	the	pregnancy	go	to	term	she	has	the	alternative	of	bringing	up	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">child	 herself	 openly	 or	 of	 placing	 it	 secretly	 in	 a	 foundling	 asylum.	 In	 the	 first case,	 the	 necessity	 of	 publicly	 acknowledging	 illegitimate	 motherhood	 requires</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	much	moral	courage	that	not	one	woman	in	a	thousand	is	equal	to	it.	It	is	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">moral	 courage	 alone	 that	 is	 required;	 the	 social	 ostracism	 could	 be	 borne	 with stoicism	and	even	with	equanimity,	if	with	it	were	not	frequently	associated	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fear	 or	 the	 real	 danger	 of	 starvation.	 For	 under	 our	 present	 system	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">illegitimate	 mother	 finds	 many	 avenues	 of	 activity	 closed	 to	 her.	 A	 school</p>
<p class="calibre1">teacher	would	lose	her	position	instantly,	and	so	would	a	woman	in	any	public</p>
<p class="calibre1">position.	It	is	feared	that	her	example	might	have	a	contaminating	influence	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	children	or	on	her	fellow	workers.	Nor	could	she	be	a	social	worker—I	know</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 more	 than	 one	 woman	 who	 lost	 her	 position	 with	 social	 or	 philanthropic</p>
<p class="calibre1">institutions	 as	 soon	 as	 it	 was	 discovered	 that	 she	 did	 not	 live	 up	 strictly	 to	 the conventional	code	of	sex	morality.	Nor	could	she	be	a	private	governess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	thus	seen	that	to	acknowledge	one's	self	an	illegitimate	mother	requires	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	courage,	so	much	sacrifice,	that	very,	very	few	mothers	are	now	found	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	 equal	 to	 the	 task.	 Especially	 so	 when	 it	 is	 taken	 into	 consideration	 that	 the humiliations	 and	 indignities	 to	 which	 the	 child	 is	 subjected	 and	 the	 later</p>
<p class="calibre1">reproaches	 of	 the	 child	 itself	 make	 the	 mother's	 life	 a	 veritable	 hell.	 So	 this alternative	is	generally	out	of	the	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	give	the	child	to	a	foundling	asylum	or	to	a	"baby	farm"	means	generally	to condemn	 it	 to	 a	 slow	 death—and	 not	 such	 a	 slow	 one,	 either.	 For	 as	 statistics show	about	ninety	to	ninety-five	per	cent.	of	all	babies	in	those	institutions	die</p>
<p class="calibre1">within	 a	 few	 months.	 And	 the	 very	 few	 who	 survive	 and	 grow	 up	 have	 not	 a happy	 life.	 Life	 is	 hard	 enough	 for	 anybody;	 for	 children	 who	 come	 into	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a>world	 handicapped	 by	 the	 disgrace	 of	 illegitimacy,	 life	 is	 torture	 indeed.	 It	 is with	 a	 breaking	 heart	 generally	 and	 because	 there	 is	 no	 other	 way	 out	 of	 the dilemma	that	a	mother	puts	her	baby	away	in	a	foundling	asylum.	She	hopes	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">prays	for	its	speedy	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking	into	consideration	the	pitifully	unhappy	lot	of	the	illegitimate	mother</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 illegitimate	 child,	 it	 is	 no	 wonder	 that	 every	 unmarried	 woman,	 as	 soon	 as she	finds	herself	pregnant,	is	frantically	determined	to	get	rid	of	the	child	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">womb	 as	 soon	 as	 possible.	 And	 abortion	 thrives	 in	 every	 civilized	 country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thousands	and	thousands	of	doctors	and	semi-doctors	and	midwives	are	making</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 rich	 living	 in	 this	 country	 from	 practicing	 abortion.	 The	 greater	 the	 disgrace with	 which	 illegitimacy	 is	 considered	 in	 a	 country,	 the	 stricter	 the	 prohibition against	 the	 use	 of	 measures	 for	 the	 prevention	 of	 conception,	 the	 greater	 the number	of	abortions	in	that	country.	But	abortion	is	not	a	trifle,	to	be	undertaken</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 a	 light	 heart.	 It	 is	 true	 that	 if	 performed	 by	 a	 thoroughly	 competent physician,	 with	 all	 aseptic	 precautions,	 it	 is	 practically	 free	 from	 danger.	 But when	performed	by	a	careless	physician	or	an	ignorant	midwife,	trouble	is	apt	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">happen.	Blood	poisoning	may	set	in,	and	the	patient	may	be	very	sick	for	a	time, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	may	on	recovery	from	the	acute	illness	remain	a	chronic	invalid	for	life.	And</p>
<p class="calibre1">occasionally	the	patient	dies.	Whether	or	not	abortion	is	justifiable	under	special</p>
<p class="calibre1">circumstances	 is	 a	 separate	 question,	 which	 I	 have	 discussed	 in	 another	 place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	leaving	aside	the	ethics	of	the	question,	if	you	have	determined	to	have	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">abortion	 produced,	 be	 sure	 to	 go	 to	 a	 conscientious	 physician,	 and	 avoid	 the quacks	 and	 midwives.	 An	 unexpected	 and	 undesired	 pregnancy	 is	 punishment</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough	and	there	is	no	reason	why	you	should	be	further	punished	by	becoming</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	chronic	invalid	or	by	paying	with	your	life.	There	is	no	sense	in	it.	Nobody	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">profit	by	your	invalidism	or	your	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	do	not	wish	to	leave	this	topic	without	re-emphasizing	the	fact	that	abortion</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 not	 a	 trifle,	 to	 be	 undertaken	 or	 even	 to	 be	 spoken	 of	 lightly.	 Too	 many women,	not	only	in	the	radical	ranks,	but	in	the	conservative	ranks	as	well,	are	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	habit	of	considering	abortion	as	a	joke,	a	trifling	annoyance,	something	like	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">cold	in	the	head,	which,	while	disagreeable,	is	sure	to	pass	away	in	a	day	or	two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	know	Mrs.	A	and	Mrs.	B	and	perhaps	Miss	C	who	had	abortions	produced</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	them	and	in	two	or	three	days	they	were	as	good	as	ever.	Yes.	But	they	do	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">know	 Miss	 D	 who	 is	 resting	 in	 her	 grave,	 nor	 do	 they	 know	 why	 Miss	 E	 and Mrs.	F	are	invalids	for	life.	The	women	who	get	over	their	abortion	experiences</p>
<p class="calibre1">easily	 are	 apt	 to	 talk	 of	 their	 good	 luck;	 the	 women	 who	 have	 become	 chronic invalids	or	who	are	resting	in	their	graves	as	a	result	of	an	abortion	are	not	apt	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">talk	of	the	matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a>And	therefore,	once	more,	remember,	an	abortion	is	no	trifling	matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	 other	 piece	 of	 advice	 and	 I	 am	 through.	 Some	 men	 of	 a	 low	 moral	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">mental	caliber	are	under	the	influence	of	the	pernicious	idea	that	if	a	girl	has	lost</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 virginity—no	 matter	 under	 what	 circumstances—she	 no	 longer	 amounts	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	and	is	free	prey	for	everybody	who	may	want	her.	And,	like	beasts	of	prey, </p>
<p class="calibre1">these	 wretched	 specimens	 of	 humanity	 pester	 such	 a	 girl	 with	 much	 more</p>
<p class="calibre1">impudence,	more	brazenness	than	they	dare	to	employ	in	the	case	of	a	girl	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 still	 considered	 a	 virgin.	 And,	 what	 is	 more,	 the	 girls	 themselves	 become poisoned	with	this	pernicious	idea	and	dare	not	offer	the	same	resistance	that	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">virgin	does.	And	they	often	yield	with	resignation,	though	against	their	will,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">though	they	may	experience	a	feeling	of	disgust	against	the	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	again,  <i class="calibre4">don't	you	do	it</i>.	Do	not	nurse	the	medieval	idea	that	because	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	 not	 a	 virgin	 in	 the	 physical	 sense,	 you	 are	 "ruined,"	 "no	 good,"	 and	 an outcast.	You	are	nothing	of	the	kind.	If	through	some	cause	or	other	you	are	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">longer	 in	 possession	 of	 an	 intact	 hymen,	 it	 is	 your	 affair	 or	 misfortune,	 and nobody	 else's.	 Do	 not	 on	 that	 account	 cast	 your	 eyes	 down	 and	 avoid	 meeting people.	 Carry	 your	 head	 high,	 do	 not	 fear	 to	 meet	 people,	 and	 treat	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">contempt	 the	 jeers	 of	 the	 stupid	 and	 ignorant.	 A	 person's	 entire	 character	 does not	depend	upon	the	presence	or	absence	of	the	hymen,	and	one	misstep	should</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	ruin	a	person's	whole	life.	A	boy	is	not	"ruined,"	is	not	an	outcast,	because	he has	had	sexual	relations	before	marriage,	and	while	the	boy's	and	girl's	cases	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	exactly	identical,	still	the	poor	girl	should	not	be	made	to	expiate	one	error</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	her	life	long. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	isn't	fair. </p>

<p class="calibre1">What	 are	 you	 going	 to	 do?	 Are	 you	 going	 to	 disgrace	 her—incidentally</p>

<p class="calibre1">and	 more	 than	 ever	 indulged	 in	 flirtations.	 One	 night	 she	 stayed	 out	 later	 than usual,	 her	 parents	 were	 worried,	 and	 when	 she	 came	 home	 about	 two	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">morning	 there	 was	 a	 quarrel,	 and	 the	 father,	 who	 was	 a	 strict,	 impulsive	 man, gave	her	a	pretty	good	beating.	After	that	she	went	out	very	little,	kept	to	herself, </p>
<p class="calibre1">became	 rather	 melancholy,	 lost	 her	 appetite,	 and	 did	 not	 sleep	 well.	 To	 all inquiries	she	answered	that	there	was	 nothing	 the	 matter	 with	 her,	 that	 she	 just felt	a	little	indisposed.	Four	or	five	months	thus	passed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 finally	 the	 condition	 could	 no	 longer	 be	 concealed.	 The	 mother	 was	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">first	 one	 to	 discover	 it.	 When	 the	 fact	 dawned	 upon	 her	 consciousness	 that	 her beautiful,	not	quite	eighteen-year-old	Edith	was	pregnant	she	promptly	fell	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">faint	 and	 it	 took	 Edith	 and	 the	 maid	 quite	 some	 time	 to	 restore	 her	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a>consciousness.	 She	 became	 distracted.	 She	 floundered	 about	 pitifully,	 not knowing	what	to	do,	what	decision	to	reach.	She	tried	to	conceal	the	matter	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	father,	but	he	saw	that	there	was	something	wrong	and	it	didn't	take	him	long</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	worm	the	truth	out	of	her.	As	the	mother	on	learning	the	tragic	truth	had	taken</p>
<p class="calibre1">refuge	 in	 a	 dead	 faint,	 so	 he	 took	 refuge	 in	 a	 Berserker	 rage.	 He	 fumed	 and stormed	 and	 was	 in	 danger	 of	 an	 apoplectic	 stroke.	 He	 wanted	 to	 strike	 the daughter,	but	the	mother	interfered.	He	then	ordered	Edith	to	get	out	of	the	house</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	never	to	cross	his	threshold	again.	Edith	looked	at	him	to	see	if	he	meant	it; </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	mother	tried	to	intercede;	but	he	was	inflexible,	and	demanded	that	she	leave</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	once.	Edith	began	to	gather	a	few	of	her	belongings,	the	tears	silently	rolling</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	here	a	sudden	change	came	over	the	father.	Some	men	(and	women)	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">crushed	 by	 small	 misfortunes;	 real	 catastrophes	 awaken	 their	 finer	 qualities, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which	lay	dormant	within	them	and	which	might	have	remained	dormant	within</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	 forever.	 In	 these	 few	 minutes	 he	 seems	 to	 have	 undergone	 a	 complete</p>
<p class="calibre1">metamorphosis.	He	went	up	to	Edith,	took	her	in	his	arms,	kissed	her,	told	her	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">stay,	 to	 calm	 down	 and	 they	 would	 see	 what	 could	 be	 done.	 In	 a	 few	 days	 she was	taken	over	to	a	physician	who	performed	an	abortion.	She	was	a	pretty	sick</p>
<p class="calibre1">girl	 for	 about	 six	 weeks,	 and	 at	 one	 time	 there	 was	 danger	 of	 blood	 poisoning setting	 in.	 But	 she	 recovered.	 And	 she	 was	 a	 different	 girl.	 She	 had	 shed	 her frivolity	and	lightheartedness	like	an	old	garment.	She	took	her	last	year	in	high</p>
<p class="calibre1">school	 over	 again,	 entered	 Barnard,	 from	 which	 she	 was	 graduated	 among	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	 first,	 and	 soon	 began	 to	 teach	 in	 that	 very	 high	 school	 in	 which	 she	 had been	a	pupil.	One	of	the	teachers	fell	in	love	with	her	and	she	fell	in	love	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">him.	He	asked	her	to	marry	him.	She	wanted	no	skeleton	from	the	past	coming</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	 rattling	 its	 bones	 and	 marring	 their	 married	 life,	 and	 she	 told	 him	 of	 the unfortunate	incident.	A	good	test,	by	the	way,	to	find	out	a	man's	real	love	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">breadth	 of	 character.	 Fortunately	 the	 man's	 love	 was	 a	 true	 love,	 not	 merely passion,	 and	 he	 was	 truly	 broadminded,	 which	 is	 not	 a	 very	 common	 thing</p>
<p class="calibre1">among	school-teachers.	Their	married	life	is	an	uncloudedly	happy	one.	And	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">relation	 between	 the	 daughter	 and	 the	 parents	 is	 one	 of	 sincere	 love	 and	 deep mutual	respect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Isn't	it	better	so? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Didn't	 Edith's	 parents	 act	 more	 decently,	 more	 kindly,	 more	 humanely,	 more</p>
<p class="calibre1">wisely	than	the	parents,	say,	of	Mary	B,	who,	when	they	found	out	her	condition, </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a>more	wisely	even	from	a	purely	selfish	point	of	view	than	the	father	of	Bridget C,	who	kicked	his	daughter	out	penniless	into	the	street,	where	he	had	to	see	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">afterwards	powdered	and	painted	soliciting	men	and	boys?	The	mother	died	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">broken	heart,	and	the	father,	unable	to	bear	the	constant,	daily	repeated	disgrace, </p>
<p class="calibre1">became	an	incorrigible	drunkard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fathers	and	mothers!	So	bring	up	your	daughters,	so	guard	them	and	protect</p>

<p class="calibre1">Biologically	 considered,	 the	 desire	 on	 the	 woman's	 part	 for	 sex	 relations</p>
<p class="calibre1">during	 the	 menses	 should	 not	 seem	 strange	 or	 abnormal,	 for	 we	 must	 bear	 in mind	 that	 menstruation	 bears	 a	 certain	 analogy	 to	 the	 rut	 in	 animals.	 And</p>

<p class="calibre1">any	discharge	that	a	woman	may	be	suffering	from	is	always	aggravated	during</p>

<p class="calibre1">Let	us	see	where	the	belief	of	"sex	relations	for	procreation	only"	would	lead us	to.	In	a	normal	healthy	couple	impregnation	follows	one	connection.	So	if	a</p>

<p class="calibre1">and	 intercourse	 without	 a	 probable	 or	 possible	 pregnancy	 is	 a	 sin.	 Also</p>

<p class="calibre1">if	 she	 has	 some	 little	 trouble	 which	 makes	 pregnancy	 impossible,	 sex	 relations must	 be	 absolutely	 abstained	 from.	 And	 of	 course	 if	 the	 husband	 or	 wife	 is sterile,	all	relations	must	be	renounced	forever,	no	matter	how	strong	the	libido</p>

<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately	this	is	not	the	case.	For	we	know	that	the	sexual	libido	in	women</p>

<p class="calibre1">Nor	 has	 Nature	 abolished	 the	 sexual	 instinct	 and	 the	 passionate	 desire	 for	 sex relations	in	all	those	men	and	women	who	are	for	some	reason	or	other	sterile,	or</p>

<p class="calibre1">As	 I	 stated	 at	 the	 beginning,	 it	 is	 a	 waste	 of	 time	 to	  <i class="calibre4">argue</i>	 the	 matter.	 Those who	believe	that	sex	relations	are	for	racial	purposes	only,	are	welcome	to	their</p>

We	 must	 reiterate	 our	 opinion	 that	 the	 sex	 instinct	 has	 other high	 purposes	 besides	 that	 of	 perpetuating	 the	 race,	 and	 sex	 relations	 may	 and should	 be	 indulged	 in	 as	 often	 as	 they	 are	 conducive	 to	 man's	 and	 woman's</p>

It	 is	 therefore very	 unwise	 in	 conditions	 of	 sterility	 to	 subject	 the	 wife	 to	 treatment	 without first	examining	the	husband.	Nevertheless,	this	is	still	often	the	case,	particularly</p>
<p class="calibre1">among	 the	 lower	 classes	 or	 among	 the	 ignorant.	 There	 are	 cases	 where	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman	goes	from	one	doctor	to	another	for	years	and	is	subjected	to	all	kinds	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">treatment,	when	a	simple	examination	of	the	husband	would	show	that	the	fault</p>
<p class="calibre1">lies	with	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	 women	 have	 one	 child	 and	 are	 unable	 afterwards	 to	 give	 birth	 to	 any</p>
<p class="calibre1">more.	 Such	 a	 condition	 is	 called	 one-child-sterility.	 It	 is	 generally	 due	 to	 an inflammation	 of	 the	 Fallopian	 tubes	 which	 closes	 up	 the	 openings	 of	 the	 tubes into	the	womb,	so	that	no	more	ova	can	pass	 <i class="calibre4">from</i>	the	ovaries	 <i class="calibre4">through</i>	the	tubes <i class="calibre4">into</i>	the	womb.

<p class="calibre1">The	 conditions	 which	 cause	 sterility	 in	 women	 are	 many,	 but	 the	 most</p>

<p class="calibre1">may	 be	 caused	 by	 gonorrhea	 or	 any	 other	 inflammation.	 A	 severe	 leucorrhea</p>
<p class="calibre1">may	also	be	the	cause	of	sterility,	because	the	leucorrheal	discharge	may	be	fatal</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 spermatozoa.	 Another	 cause	 is	 a	 severe	 bending	 or	 turning	 of	 the	 uterus either	forwards	or	backwards.	The	opening	of	the	neck	of	the	womb,	the	os,	may</p>
<p class="calibre1">also	 be	 closed,	 or	 practically	 so,	 from	 ulceration,	 from	 strong	 applications,	 etc. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 some	 cases	 sterility	 may	 be	 due	 to	 severe	 constitutional	 disease,	 when	 the person	 is	 very	 much	 run	 down	 and	 so	 anemic	 that	 menstruation	 stops. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately	 this	 is	 not	 always	 the	 case,	 for	 women	 even	 in	 the	 last	 stages	 of consumption	 may,	 and	 often	 do,	 become	 pregnant.	 Syphilis	 unfortunately	 does</p>

<p class="calibre1">not	know	these	facts	or	does	not	want	to	know	them,	and	the	intact	hymen	is	still</p>

<p class="calibre1">When	 a	 boy	 gets	 some	 trouble	 with	 his	 genital	 organs,	 such	 as	 phimosis,	 or balanitis	or	whatever	it	may	be,	he	is	at	once	taken	to	a	physician,	who	institutes</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 necessary	 treatment.	 When	 a	 little	 girl	 complains	 of	 itching	 around	 the</p>

<p class="calibre1">and	 he	 says	 that	 in	 order	 to	 treat	 the	 case	 thoroughly	 the	 hymen	 has	 to	 be stretched	or	opened,	the	mother	will	withhold	her	consent,	and	the	disease	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 allowed	 to	 progress.	 I	 know	 of	 many	 such	 cases.	 This	 is	 wrong.	 When	 the health	 of	 the	 girl	 demands	 and	 her	 future	 child-bearing	 power	 is	 at	 stake,	 no hesitation	should	be	felt	in	sacrificing	the	hymen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though	 in	 the	 future	 the	 fuss	 which	 is	 now	 made	 about	 the	 hymen,	 the</p>

<p class="calibre1">entirely	absent?	This	question	I	am	forced	to	answer	in	the	affirmative.	Because</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	various	investigations	I	have	made	it	can	hardly	be	subject	to	doubt	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 uterus	 during	 an	 orgasm	 exerts	 a	 certain	 amount	 of	 suction;	 and	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">impregnation	is	 <i class="calibre4">more	likely</i>	to	follow	when	the	spermatozoa	are	sucked	up	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	uterus	than	when	left	to	make	their	own	way	by	their	own	power	of	motion, </p>
<p class="calibre1">stands	 to	 reason	 and	 goes	 without	 saying.	 In	 the	 former	 instance	 it	 takes	 less time	for	the	spermatozoa	to	reach	the	ovum,	and	there	is	less	chance	for	them	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">perish	on	the	way—from	malnutrition	or	from	coming	in	contact	with	secretions</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	an	acid	reaction.	There	is	another	point.	I	do	not	bring	it	forth	as	a	proved	fact</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	as	a	fact	susceptible	to	proof.	It	is	a	mere	hypothesis,	but	in	my	opinion	it	is	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">correct	and	plausible	hypothesis.	I	believe	that	the	strong	spasmodic	contractions</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	take	place	during	the	orgasm	have	an	influence	not	only	in	accelerating	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bursting	 of	 a	 Graafian	 follicle	 and	 the	 extrusion	 of	 an	 ovum,	 but	 they	 are instrumental	in	aiding	the	Fallopian	tube	to	grasp	the	ovum	and	helping	it	along</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 the	 road	 towards	 the	 uterus.	 It	 is	 therefore	 not	 at	 all	 inconceivable	 that conception	may	take	place	during	or	within	a	very	short	time	after	an	act	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	accompanied	by	a	proper	orgasm.	Many	women	claim	to	experience	peculiar</p>
<p class="calibre1">unmistakable	 sensations	 as	 soon	 as	 conception	 has	 taken	 place,	 and	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1">calculating	 the	 day	 of	 probable	 delivery	 we	 know	 that	 they	 are	 right.	 Taking therefore	 all	 the	 various	 data	 into	 consideration	 we	 are	 fully	 justified	 in	 saying that	 while	 an	 orgasm	 or	 a	 voluptuous	 sensation	 during	 the	 act	 is	 not	 at	 all <i class="calibre4">necessary</i>	to	impregnation,	it	is	in	many	cases	a	helpful	factor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	claimed	by	some	that	the	offspring	resulting	from	an	orgastic	act	is	apt	to</p>

<p class="calibre1">intercourse	 in	 which	 the	 parties	 experience	 no	 orgasm.	 The	 reason	 given	 being that	 conception	 in	 the	 first	 instance	 taking	 place	 quickly,	 the	 spermatozoa	 are better	 nourished	 and	 more	 vigorous.	 In	 my	 opinion	 this	 is	 merely	 a	 fanciful</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a>hypothesis	which	needn't	be	taken	seriously. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A	 careful	 investigation	 of	 their	 menstrual	 discharge	 will	 show	 that	  <i class="calibre4">it	 is	 not</i> <i class="calibre4">because	they	failed	to	conceive</i>,	 but	 because	 the	 impregnated	 ovum	 is	 expelled each	 time;	 in	 other	 words,	 they	 have	 each	 month	 a	 miniature	 miscarriage.

<p class="calibre1">The	 causes	 of	 frigidity	 in	 women	 are	 many,	 but	 here	 are	 the	 most	 important ones:	First	and	foremost	is	the	repression	of	all	sexual	manifestations	which	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">unmarried	woman	has	to	practice,	and	has	had	to	practice	for	many	centuries.	So</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 a	 part	 of	 the	 frigidity	 is	 hereditary.	 You	 cannot	 entirely	 eradicate	 a	 natural instinct,	 but	 that	 by	 continually	 repressing	 it,	 by	 giving	 it	 no	 chance	 to	 assert itself,	you	may	weaken	it—about	this	there	can	be	no	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	second	cause	is	masturbation.	Cases	that	have	been	addicted	to	excessive</p>
<p class="calibre1">masturbation	are	very	apt	to	develop	not	only	frigidity,	but	complete	aversion	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	sexual	act,	and	inability	to	experience	any	pleasure	or	orgasm.	Such	cases	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">come	across	every	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 third	 very	 important	 cause	 is	 sexual	 weakness	 in	 the	 husband.	 When	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">husband	is	sexually	weak	(suffering	with	premature	ejaculations)	he	either	fails</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	awaken	the	sexual	instinct	in	the	woman,	or	if	it	has	been	awakened	it	is	apt	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">turn	not	only	into	frigidity	but	into	aversion	to	the	act. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 fourth	 cause	 is	 often	 merely	 dislike	 towards	 the	 husband.	 The	 last	 two</p>
<p class="calibre1">causes,	weakness	of	the	husband	and	dislike	towards	him,	are	unfortunately	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">frequent,	 and	 a	 wife	 who	 was	 frigid	 with	 one	 husband	 may	 show	 herself	 very passionate	on	marrying	another	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fifth	cause	is	fear	of	pregnancy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 above	 are	 the	 five	 principal	 causes.	 Other	 causes	 may	 be	 disease	 of	 the uterus,	laceration	of	the	cervix,	inflammation	of	the	ovaries,	vaginismus,	disease</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	thyroid	gland,	etc. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	an	unfortunate	fact	that	women	who	were	frigid	up	to	the	age	of	forty	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	may	become	very	passionate	after	that	age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	to	the	treatment	of	frigidity,	little	or	nothing	can	be	done	for	frigidity	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	congenital.	Most	of	the	other	kinds	of	frigidity,	however,	can	be	cured. </p>

<p class="calibre1">I	wish	to	give	you	a	piece	of	advice	which	is	of	extremely	great	importance	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">you.	I	hesitated	somewhat	before	writing	this	chapter,	but	the	welfare	of	so	many</p>
<p class="calibre1">women	depends	upon	following	this	advice,	and	I	have	seen	the	lives	of	so	many</p>
<p class="calibre1">wives	 spoiled	 on	 account	 of	 not	 having	 followed	 it,	 that	 I	 decided	 to	 devote	 a few	words	to	the	subject. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 you	 know,	 about	 one-third	 or	 one-quarter	 of	 all	 women	 (in	 other	 words, </p>
<p class="calibre1">one	out	of	every	three	or	four)	are	sexually	frigid.	They	either	have	little	or	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">sexual	desire,	or	if	they	do	have,	they	experience	no	voluptuous	sensation	during</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	act,	and	never	have	an	orgasm.	If	you	are	unmarried,	well	and	good.	But	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	are	married	and	happen	to	belong	to	the	frigid	type,	then	 <i class="calibre4">don't	inform	your</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">husband	of	the	fact</i>.	It	may	lead	to	great	and	permanent	trouble.	Some	husbands</p>
<p class="calibre1">don't	 care.	 Some	 are	 even	 glad	 if	 their	 wives	 are	 frigid.	 They	 can	 then	 consult their	 own	 wishes	 in	 the	 matter,	 they	 can	 have	 intercourse	 whenever	 they	 want and	  <i class="calibre4">the	 way	 they	 want</i>.	 They	 do	 not	 have	 to	 accommodate	 themselves	 to	 their wives'	ways,	they	do	not	have	to	prolong	the	act	until	she	gets	the	orgasm,	etc.	In</p>
<p class="calibre1">short,	some	husbands	consider	a	frigid	wife	a	blessing,	a	God-sent	treasure.	But, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	I	mentioned	several	times	before,	in	sexual	matters	every	man	is	a	law	unto</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself,	 and	 some	 men	 feel	 extremely	 bad	 and	 displeased	 when	 they	 find	 out</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 their	 wives	 have	 "no	 feeling."	 Some	 become	 furious,	 some	 become disgusted.	Some	lose	all	pleasure	in	intercourse,	and	some	claim	to	be	unable	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	intercourse	with	any	woman	who	is	not	properly	responsive.	Some	begin	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p171"></a>go	 to	 other	 women,	 while	 some	 threaten	 or	 demand	 a	 divorce	 (of	 course,	 such men	 cannot	 really	 love	 their	 wives;	 they	 may	 use	 their	 wives'	 frigidity	 as	 an <i class="calibre4">excuse</i>	to	get	rid	of	them). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now,	a	man	has	no	way	of	knowing	whether	a	woman	has	a	feeling	during	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">act	or	not,	whether	or	no	she	enjoys	it,	whether	or	no	she	has	an	orgasm.	These</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	 subjective	 feelings,	 and	 the	 man	 cannot	 know	 them	 unless	 you	 tell	 him.	 If you	belong	to	the	independent	kind,	if	you	scorn	simulation	and	deceit,	if,	as	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">price	 of	 being	 perfectly	 truthful,	 you	 are	 willing	 if	 necessary	 to	 part	 with	 your husband	or	give	him	a	divorce,	well	and	good.	You	are	a	free	human	being,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">nobody	has	a	right	to	tell	you	what	to	do	with	your	body.	But	if	you	care	for	your</p>
<p class="calibre1">husband,	if	you	care	for	your	home	and	perhaps	children,	and	do	not	want	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">disruption,	 then	 the	 only	 thing	 for	 you	 to	 do	 is	 not	 to	 apprise	 your	 husband	 of your	frigid	condition.	And	it	won't	hurt	you	to	simulate	a	feeling	which	you	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 experience,	 and	 even	 to	 imitate	 the	 orgasm.	 He	 won't	 be	 any	 the	 wiser,	 he will	enjoy	you	more,	and	nobody	will	be	injured	by	your	little	deception,	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 after	 all	 a	 species	 of	 white	 lie,	 and	 is	 nobody's	 business	 but	 your	 own.	 An innocent	 deception	 which	 hurts	 nobody,	 but,	 on	 the	 contrary,	 benefits	 all</p>
<p class="calibre1">concerned,	is	perfectly	permissible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	may	seem	rather	strange	publicly	to	give	advice	to	deceive	and	to	simulate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	it	is	undoubtedly	the	first	time	that	this	advice	has	been	given	in	print.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 I	 have	 only	 one	 religion—the	 greatest	 happiness	 of	 the	 greatest	 number—I</p>
<p class="calibre1">repeat	 that	 I	 can	 see	 nothing	 wrong	 in	 advising	 something	 which	 benefits</p>
<p class="calibre1">everybody	(concerned)	and	hurts	nobody.	More	than	one	household	which	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">threatened	with	disruption	was	preserved	safe	and	sound	by	a	little	simple	advice</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	I	gave	to	the	wife,	without	the	husband's	knowledge.	He	was	satisfied,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">things	after	that	ran	smoothly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	women	are	afraid	to	simulate	a	voluptuous	or	orgastic	feeling,	because</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	think	the	husband	can	discover	whether	their	feeling	is	genuine	or	they	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	 simulating.	 (Women,	 and	 men	 too,	 have	 funny	 ideas	 on	 sexual	 subjects). </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	is	not	so.	A	notorious	demi-mondaine,	who	was	greatly	sought	because	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 known	 to	 be	 so	 "passionate,"	 confessed	 that	 not	 once	 in	 her	 life	 did	 she enjoy	 intercourse	 or	 experience	 an	 orgasm.	 But	 her	 mother,	 who	 also	 suffered with	absolute	frigidity,	taught	her	to	simulate	passion,	telling	her	that	in	that	way</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	could	make	barrels	of	money;	which	she	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 is	 deplorable	 that	 wives—or	 husbands—should	 ever	 be	 obliged	 to	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">recourse	to	deception	or	simulation;	perfect	frankness	should	be	the	ideal	to	be</p>

<p class="calibre1">Dentists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having	 intercourse	 with	 a	 woman	 by	 force,	 without	 her	 consent,	 is	 called</p>
<p class="calibre1">rape.	 When	 the	 woman	 is	 not	 in	 a	 condition	 to	 give	 consent,	 as	 when	 she	 is insane,	 feebleminded,	 unconscious	 or	 drunk,	 or	 when	 she	 is	 not	 of	 the	 age	 at which	she	can	legally	give	consent,	it	also	constitutes	rape,	and	the	punishment</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 the	 same.	 The	 age	 of	 consent	 differs	 in	 different	 countries	 and	 in	 different States,	but	as	a	rule	is	between	sixteen	and	eighteen	years.	That	is,	if	a	girl	under</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	legal	age	of	consent	should	give	her	consent	or	even	if	she	should	urge	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	 to	 have	 intercourse	 with	 her	 the	 man	 would	 be	 punished	 just	 as	 if	 he	 had committed	rape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 punishment	 for	 rape	 is	 very	 severe	 in	 all	 civilized	 countries	 and	 ranges from	ten	years'	imprisonment	to	life	imprisonment,	while	in	some	States	in	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">Union	the	punishment	is	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 is	 not	 my	 intention	 to	 go	 into	 an	 exhaustive	 discussion	 of	 this	 painful subject.	In	this	brief	chapter	I	merely	wish	to	bring	out	two	facts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First,	that	it	is	the	almost	unanimous	opinion	of	all	experts	that	it	is	practically</p>
<p class="calibre1">impossible	 for	 a	 man	 to	 commit	 rape	 on	 a	 normal	 adult	 girl	 or	 woman	 if	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p173"></a>really	 offers	 all	 the	 resistance	 of	 which	 she	 is	 capable.	 Of	 course,	 if	 the	 man knocks	 the	 woman	 down	 with	 a	 blow,	 rendering	 her	 unconscious,	 that	 is	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">different	 matter.	 But	 where	 no	 brutality	 is	 used	 by	 the	 man,	 and	 the	 woman offers	 all	 the	 resistance	 she	 is	 capable	 of,	 rape	 is	 practically	 impossible.	 It	 is, however,	possible	that	in	some	cases	the	girl	may	be	so	paralyzed	by	fear	as	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	incapable	of	offering	any	resistance.	When	the	man	threatens	her	with	death</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	severe	bodily	injury,	then	it	is	rape	even	if	she	offers	no	resistance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	second	point	is	that	it	has	been	established	that	of	the	many	accusations	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">rape	brought	before	the	courts	 <i class="calibre4">most</i>	are	false.	Out	of	a	hundred	cases	only	about ten	are	true.	The	rest	are	false.	This	false	accusation	of	rape	is	due	to	a	peculiar</p>
<p class="calibre1">perversion	 with	 which	 some	 women	 suffer.	 Some	 of	 the	 cases	 are	 due	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">hysteria,	 to	 imagination,	 the	 women	 really	 believing	 that	 rape	 or	 an	 attempt	 at rape	 was	 committed	 on	 them,	 while	 investigation	 shows	 the	 accusation	 to	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">entirely	false.	Many	accusations	of	rape	are	due	to	a	desire	for	revenge	or	merely</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	motives	of	blackmail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Careful	 doctors	 and	 dentists	 will	 refuse	 to	 give	 laughing	 gas	 or	 another</p>
<p class="calibre1">anesthetic	to	women	except	in	the	presence	of	others,	because,	as	is	well	known, </p>
<p class="calibre1">an	 anesthetic	 often	 causes	 in	 women	 erotic	 dreams	 and	 sensations	 and	 makes</p>

<p class="calibre1">When	 a	 man	 marries	 a	 girl	 he	 expects	 her	 to	 be	 chaste,	 that	 is,	 a	 virgin, without	any	sexual	experiences.	Of	men,	the	same	chastity	is	not	expected	as	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">general	 thing.	 As	 long	 as	 a	 man	 is	 healthy,	 free	 from	 venereal	 disease,	 his previous	 sexual	 experiences	 do	 not	 constitute	 a	 barrier	 to	 his	 marriage.	 This	 is what	is	known	as	the	double	or	duplex	standard	of	sex	morality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During	 the	 past	 few	 years	 a	 number	 of	 high-minded	 and	 well-meaning	 men</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	women	have	been	trying	to	abolish	this	double	standard	and	to	introduce	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">single	 standard	 of	 morality.	 That	 is,	 they	 are	 demanding	 that	 the	 man	 going	 to the	marriage	bed	should	be	just	as	chaste,	just	as	virginal	as	his	wife	is.	Whether</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	 no	 the	 efforts	 of	 these	 good	 men	 and	 women	 will	 ever	 be	 crowned	 with</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">should</i>	be	crowned	with	success	we	will	also	leave	open.	A	complete	discussion</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	these	questions	belongs	to	a	more	advanced	book	on	sexual	ethics.	Here	I	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">merely	say	that,	taking	into	consideration	the	fact	that	the	sexual	instinct	in	boys</p>
<p class="calibre1">awakens	 fully	 at	 the	 age	 of	 fifteen	 or	 sixteen,	 and	 that	 marriage	 at	 the	 present time,	particularly	among	the	professional	classes,	is	an	impossibility	before	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">age	 of	 twenty-eight,	 thirty,	 or	 thirty-five,	 it	 seems	 to	 be	 impossible	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">undesirable	to	expect	that	men	should	live	a	perfectly	chaste	life	until	they	enter</p>
<p class="calibre1">matrimony,	no	matter	how	late	that	event	may	take	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those	who	have	made	a	study	of	the	sex	instinct	in	the	male	seem	to	think	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">chastity	 in	 normal,	 healthy	 men	 up	 to	 the	 age	 of	 thirty	 or	 thereabouts	 is	 an impossibility,	and	where	it	is	accomplished	it	is	accomplished	at	the	expense	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	physical,	mental,	and	sexual	health	of	the	individual.	But	be	it	as	it	may,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaving	 disputed	 questions	 out	 of	 discussion,	 the	 fact	 remains	 that	 the	 vast majority	of	men	of	the	present	day	do	indulge	in	sex	relations	before	marriage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	people	that	are	urging	upon	our	young	women	to	refuse	to	marry	men	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	not	been	perfectly	chaste	are	doing	our	womanhood	a	very	poor	service.	As</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	is	now,	with	all	mandom	to	choose	from,	there	are	many,	too	many,	old	maids. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p175"></a>With	only	ten	per	cent.	to	choose	from	(because	it	is	admitted	that	at	least	90	per cent.	 of	 all	 men	 have	 ante-matrimonial	 relations),	 what	 would	 our	 women	 do? </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 would	 practically	 all	 have	 to	 give	 up	 any	 hopes	 of	 being	 married	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">becoming	mothers.	And	if	these	ten	per	cent.,	who	have	remained	chaste	to	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">married	day,	were	at	least	a	superior	class	of	men	in	every	instance,	there	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 some	 compensation	 in	 that.	 Unfortunately,	 this	 is	 far	 from	 being	 the	 case, because,	 as	 all	 advanced	 sexologists	 will	 tell	 you,	 there	 is	 generally	 something wrong	with	a	man	who	remains	absolutely	chaste	until	the	age	of	thirty,	thirty-five	 or	 forty.	 It	 isn't	 moral	 principles	 in	 all	 cases;	 it	 is	 mostly	 cowardice,	 or sexual	weakness.	And	sad	as	it	may	be	to	state,	these	perfectly	good,	chaste	men</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	 not	 generally	 make	 satisfactory	 husbands,	 and	 their	 wives	 are	 not	 apt	 to	 be the	happiest	ones.	I	fully	agree	with	Professor	Freud	in	his	statement	"that	sexual abstinence	 does	 not	 help	 to	 build	 up	 energetic,	 independent	 men	 of	 action, </p>
<p class="calibre1">original	thinkers,	bold	advocates	of	freedom	and	reform,	but	rather	goody-goody</p>
<p class="calibre1">weaklings."	And	still	more	to	the	purpose	is	the	statement	of	Professor	Michels, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who	says:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	desire	that	one's	daughter	may	marry	a	man	who,	like	herself,	and	on	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">equal	 footing,	 will	 gain	 in	 marriage	 his	 first	 experience	 of	 the	 most	 sacred mysteries	of	the	sexual	life,	is	one	which	 <i class="calibre4">may	lead	to	profound	disillusionments</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	 if	 to-day	 the	 demand	 for	 chaste	 young	 men	 is	 extremely	 restricted,	 the supply	is	yet	more	so,	and	the	article	 <i class="calibre4">is	of	such	an	inferior	quality</i>	that	in	actual practice	the	attempt	to	satisfy	this	desire	is	likely	to	lead	to	results	which	will	fail altogether	to	correspond	to	the	hopes	inspired	by	a	contemplation	of	the	abstract</p>
<p class="calibre1">idea	 of	 purity.	 Many	 physically	 intact	 individuals	 of	 both	 sexes	  <i class="calibre4">are	 far	 more</i> <i class="calibre4">contaminated</i>	 than	 those	 who	 have	 had	 actual	 sexual	 experience.	 Others	 again, superior	 in	 the	 abstract,	 and	 from	 the	 physically	 sexual	 aspect,	 are	  <i class="calibre4">ethically</i> <i class="calibre4">inferior	to	the	unchaste</i>,	so	that	the	union	with	these	latter	would	be	more	likely to	 prove	 happy	 than	 a	 union	 with	 those	 who	 are	 nominally	 pure."	 And	 further, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Careful	fathers	of	marriageable	daughters,	who	seek	this	virginity	in	their	sons-</p>
<p class="calibre1">in-law,	 will,	 if	 they	 find	 it,	 seldom	 find	 it	 a	 guarantee	 for	 the	 simultaneous possession	of	solid	moral	qualities." </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	a	girl	has	a	right	to	demand	is	that	her	future	husband	be	in	good	health, </p>
<p class="calibre1">physically	and	sexually,	and	that	he	be	free	from	venereal	disease.	His	previous</p>
<p class="calibre1">sexual	life,	provided	he	is	a	man	of	fine	moral	character	in	general,	is	no	concern</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	hers.	Even	if	the	man	was	unfortunate	enough	to	have	contracted	gonorrhea, </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The	Critic	and	Guide</i>,	will	show:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Case	One</b>	was	a	girl	of	twenty-four,	of	well-to-do	parents,	a	college	graduate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 was	 engaged	 to	 a	 really	 very	 nice,	 sympathetic	 young	 man,	 who</p>
<p class="calibre1">undoubtedly	would	have	made	her	an	excellent	husband.	But	during	her	last	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">years	 in	 college	 she	 became	 imbued	 with	 the	 single	 standard	 stupidity,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">"chastity	for	men,	votes	for	women"	became	her	slogan.	She	asked	her	fiancé	if he	 had	 been	 absolutely	 chaste	 before	 he	 met	 her.	 He	 did	 not	 want	 to	 play	 the hypocrite,	 and	 he	 told	 her	 the	 truth	 that	 he	 had	 not.	 But	 he	 assured	 her	 that	 he had	never	been	infected	and	that	his	general	and	sexual	health	was	in	excellent</p>
<p class="calibre1">condition.	 Being	 then	 in	 an	 exalted	 mood,	 she	 impulsively	 broke	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">engagement,	declaring	that	her	husband	will	have	to	be	as	"pure"	as	she	was.	She soon	regretted	her	step,	because	she	loved	the	man;	but	pride	did	not	let	her	take</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	initiative	towards	a	reconciliation,	and	in	the	meantime	her	former	fiancé	fell</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	love	with	and	married	another	girl.	After	four	years	had	passed,	and	she	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	danger	of	becoming	an	old	maid,	she	married	a	man	considerably	beneath	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">socially	 and	 intellectually,	 and	 in	 every	 way	 inferior	 to	 her	 former	 fiancé.	 Her marriage	is	not	a	happy	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Case	two</b>	is	similar	to	case	one,	except	that	the	young	lady	in	question—now</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 so	 very	 young—is	 still	 living	 in	 single	 blessedness,	 and	 the	 chances	 of	 her ever	being	a	wife	or	even	somebody's	sweetheart	are	rapidly	vanishing.	I	might</p>
<p class="calibre1">add	 that	 her	 fiancé	 whom	 she	 discarded	 because	 of	 his	 lack	 of	 virginity	 was	 a very	 bright	 young	 physician,	 who	 is	 now	 very	 successful	 and	 very	 happily</p>
<p class="calibre1">married.	 She	 I	 hear	 is	 a	 very	 unhappy	 person,	 in	 danger	 of	 sinking	 into	 a permanent	state	of	melancholia.	And	she	had	been	of	a	very	jolly	disposition. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Case	three</b>	is	peculiar	in	that	the	fiancé	 <i class="calibre4">was</i>	absolutely	chaste.	She	asked	him, and	he	told	her	that	he	had	never	had	any	relations	with	anybody	and	he	never</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 a	 trace	 or	 suspicion	 of	 any	 venereal	 disease.	 The	 young	 lady	 was	 not</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p177"></a>satisfied.	 She	 wanted	 her	 fiancé	 to	 bring	 her	 a	 certificate	 from	 a	 specialist testifying	to	that	effect.	The	young	man	told	her	that	it	was	foolish,	that	he	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	subject	himself	to	the	expense	and	annoyance	of	a	number	of	tests	when	he</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">knew</i>	 that	 not	 only	 did	 he	 not	 have	 any	 venereal	 disease,	 but	 that	 there	 was	 no possibility	of	his	getting	any.	No,	that	did	not	satisfy	her.	She	became	suspicious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	 you	 have	 nothing	 to	 fear,	 why	 do	 you	 object	 to	 bringing	 a	 certificate?"	 "I have	nothing	to	fear,	but	I	demand	that	you	respect	me	and	trust	me	sufficiently</p>

<p class="calibre1">broke	 the	 engagement,	 as	 any	 self-respecting	 man	 under	 the	 circumstances</p>

<p class="calibre1">is	monogamous	and	as	a	rule	sexually	frigid;	the	next	time	you	will	be	assured</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 without	 love	 a	 woman's	 life	 is	 nothing,	 and	 you	 will	 be	 confronted	 with Byron's	well-known	and	oft	quoted	two	lines:	Man's	love	is	of	man's	life	a	thing</p>
<p class="calibre1">apart,	'Tis	woman's	whole	existence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These	contradictions	are	only	apparent	and	result	from	two	facts:	first,	that	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">words	 sex	 or	 sexual	 instinct	 and	 love	 are	 used	 indiscriminately	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">interchangeably	as	if	they	were	synonymous	terms,	which	they	are	not;	second, </p>
<p class="calibre1">there	 is	 failure	 to	 bear	 in	 mind	 the	 essential	 differences	 in	 the	 natures	 and manifestations	 of	 the	 sexual	 instincts	 in	 the	 male	 and	 the	 female.	 If	 these differences	 are	 made	 clear,	 the	 apparent	 contradictions	 will	 disappear.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">outstanding	 fact	 to	 bear	 in	 mind	 is	 that	 in	 man	 the	 sex	 instinct	 bears	 a	 more sensual,	 a	 more	 physical,	 a	 coarser	 and	 grosser	 character,	 if	 you	 have	 no</p>
<p class="calibre1">objection	to	these	adjectives,	than	it	does	in	woman.	In	women	it	is	finer,	more</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p179"></a>spiritual,	 more	 platonic,	 to	 use	 this	 stereotyped	 and	 incorrect	 term.	 In	 men	 the sex	 manifestations	 are	 more	 centralized,	 more	 local,	 more	 concentrated	 in	 the sex	 organs;	 in	 women	 they	 are	 more	 diffused	 throughout	 the	 body.	 In	 a	 boy	 of fifteen	 the	 libido	 sexualis	 may	 be	 fully	 developed,	 he	 may	 have	 powerful</p>
<p class="calibre1">erections	and	a	strong	desire	for	normal	sexual	relations;	in	a	girl	of	fifteen	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">may	 not	 be	 a	 trace	 of	 any	 purely	 sexual	 desire;	 and	 this	  <i class="calibre4">lack</i>	 of	 desire	 for <i class="calibre4">physical</i>	sex	relations	may	manifest	itself	in	women	up	to	the	age	of	twenty	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">twenty-five	 (something	 that	 we	 never	 see	 in	 normal	 men);	 in	 fact,	 women	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">twenty-five	 and	 even	 older,	 who	 have	 not	 been	 stimulated	 and	 whose	 curiosity has	not	been	aroused	by	novels,	pictures,	and	tales	of	their	married	companions, </p>
<p class="calibre1">may	 not	 experience	 any	 sexual	 desire	 until	 several	 months	 after	 marriage.	 But while	their	desire	for	actual	sexual	relations	awakens	much	later	than	it	does	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">men,	their	desire	for	love,	for	caresses,	for	hugging,	for	close	friendship,	for	love</p>
<p class="calibre1">letters,	 awakens	 much	 earlier	 than	 in	 men,	 and	 occupies	 a	 greater	 part	 in	 their life;	 they	 think	 of	 love	 more	 during	 their	 waking	 hours,	 and	 they	 dream	 of	 it more	than	men	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	man—always	bear	in	mind	that	when	speaking	of	men	and	women	I	always</p>
<p class="calibre1">speak	of	the	average;	exceptions	in	either	direction	will	be	found	in	both	sexes—</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	man,	I	say,	will	generally	tire	of	paying	attentions	to	a	woman	if	he	feels	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 will	 not	 eventually	 lead	 to	 the	 biologic	 goal—sexual	 relations.	 A	 woman can	 keep	 up	 with	 a	 man	 for	 years	 without	 any	 sexual	 intercourse,	 being	 fully satisfied	 or	 more	 or	 less	 satisfied	 with	 the	 sexual	 substitutes—embraces	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">kisses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 here	 is	 as	 good	 a	 place	 as	 any	 to	 refer	 to	 the	 notion	 so	 assiduously inculcated	 in	 the	 minds	 of	 young	 women,	 that	 a	 persistent	 refusal	 of	 man's</p>
<p class="calibre1">demands	 is	 a	 sure	 way	 of	 keeping	 a	 man's	 affections;	 that	 as	 soon	 as	 man	 has satisfied	his	desires,	he	has	no	further	use	for	the	girl.	This	may	be	the	case	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	lowest	dregs—morally—of	the	male	sex;	it	is	the	opposite	of	true	of	the	male</p>
<p class="calibre1">sex	as	a	whole.	And	I	believe	that	Marcel	Prevost	was	the	first	one	to	point	it	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">(in	 his	  <i class="calibre4">Le	 Jardin	 Secret</i>).	 Nothing	 will	 hold	 a	 man's	 affections	 so	 surely	 as normal	sex	relations.	And	the	cause	of	this	is	not,	as	might	be	surmised,	merely	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">moral	one,	the	man	considering	himself	in	honor	and	duty	bound	to	stick	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman	whose	body	he	possessed.	No,	there	is	a	much	stronger	and	surer	reason:</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 reason	 is	 of	 a	 physiological	 character.	 There	 is	 born	 a	 strong	 physical attraction	which	in	the	man's	subconsciousness	plays	a	stronger	rôle	than	honor</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 duty.	 Excesses	 of	 course	 must	 be	 avoided,	 for	 excesses	 lead	 to	 satiety,	 and satiety	is	just	as	inimical	to	love	as	is	excitement	without	any	satisfaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p180"></a><b class="calibre3">Choice	Between	Physical	and	Spiritual	Love</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">But	to	return	to	our	thesis:	the	difference	between	man's	and	woman's	sex	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">love	life.	If	a	man	had	to	make	his	 <i class="calibre4">choice</i>	between	physical	love,	i.e.,	actual	sex relations	and	spiritual	love,	i.e.,	love	making,	kisses,	love	letters,	etc.,	he	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">generally	 choose	 the	 former.	 If	 a	 woman	 had	 to	  <i class="calibre4">choose</i>,	 she	 would	 generally choose	the	latter.	The	man	and	the	woman	would	prefer	both	at	the	same	time:</p>
<p class="calibre1">physical	 and	 spiritual	 love.	 But	 that	 is	 not	 the	 question.	 The	 question	 is:	 if	 it came	 to	 a	  <i class="calibre4">choice</i>;	 and	 then	 the	 results	 would	 be	 as	 I	 have	 just	 indicated.	 The correctness	 of	 my	 statements	 will	 be	 corroborated	 by	 anybody	 having	 some</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowledge	of	human	sexuality.	A	man	can	fully	enjoy	sexual	intercourse	without</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	preliminaries;	with	a	woman	the	preliminaries	are	of	the	utmost	importance, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	when	these	are	lacking	she	is	often	incapable	of	experiencing	any	pleasure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nay,	 the	 feeling	 of	 pleasure	 is	 not	 infrequently	 replaced	 by	 a	 feeling	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">dissatisfaction	and	even	disgust.	A	man	cares	more	for	the	physical	and	less	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	mental	and	spiritual	attributes	of	his	sexual	partner;	with	the	woman	just	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">opposite	is	the	case.	I	am	leaving	out	of	consideration	sexual	impotence,	because</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	 is	 a	 real	 disability,	 and	 a	 man	 suffering	 with	 it	 only	 irritates	 the	 woman without	satisfying	her.	For	this	she	will	not	stand.	But	where	the	man	is	sexually</p>
<p class="calibre1">potent—he	 may	 be	 aged	 and	 homely—his	 other	 physical	 attributes	 play	 but	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">small	 rôle	 with	 woman;	 his	 mental	 and	 spiritual	 qualities	 count	 with	 her	 for	 a good	 deal	 more.	 While	 a	 woman	 may	 be	 able	 to	 give	 a	 man	 perfect	 sexual</p>
<p class="calibre1">satisfaction,	 and	 she	 may	 have	 an	 angelic	 character,	 if	 her	 body	 is	 not	 all	 that could	be	desired,	the	man	will	be	dissatisfied	and	unhappy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Love	in	Man	Occupies	Subordinate	Place</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Try	 as	 we	 may,	 we	 cannot	 get	 away	 from	 the	 fact	 that	 in	 man's	 life	 love</p>
<p class="calibre1">occupies	 a	 subordinate	 place.	 I	 am	 speaking	 now	 of	 love,	 and	 not	 of	 "being	 in love."	Being	in	love,	as	pointed	out	in	another	place,	is	a	distinctly	pathological phenomenon,	akin	to	insanity,	and	when	a	man	is	in	love	it	may	engross	every</p>
<p class="calibre1">fiber	of	him,	it	may	preoccupy	every	minute	of	his	waking	hours,	he	may	neglect</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	his	work	and	shirk	all	his	duties,	in	fact	he	is	apt	to	make	a	much	bigger	fool</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 himself	 than	 a	 woman	 is	 under	 similar	 circumstances.	 He	 is	 less	 patient,	 he has	less	control	over	himself,	he	is	less	able	to	suffer,	he	is	less	capable	of	self-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p181"></a>sacrifice.	 But	 this,	 as	 I	 said,	 all	 refers	 to	 "being	 in	 love,"	 which	 is	 an	 entirely different	 thing	 from	 loving.	 A	 man	 may	 love	 ever	 so	 deeply,	 and	 if	 his	 love	 is reciprocated	he	will	go	on	with	his	work	in	a	smooth,	unruffled	manner.	He	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	 better	 work	 for	 it—love	 is	 a	 wonderful	 stimulus—but	 he	 will	 be	 perfectly satisfied	if	he	sees	his	love	for	an	hour	or	two	every	day,	or	even	once	or	twice	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">week.	And	if	he	has	important	and	interesting	work	to	do,	he	can	part	with	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">love	 for	 three	 months	 or	 six	 months	 without	 his	 heart	 breaking.	 Not	 so	 with woman.	A	woman	who	loves	considers	every	day	on	which	she	does	not	see	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">lover	a	day	lost.	And	she	is	apt	to	be	unhappy	and	inefficient	in	her	work	on	such</p>
<p class="calibre1">days,	and	she	bears	separation	with	much	greater	difficulty	than	does	man.	I	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	think	that	this	is	due	to	the	fact	that	a	woman's	love	is	always	more	intense</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	 a	 man's;	 no.	 But	 he	 usually	 has	 other	 interests	 which	 occupy	 his	 thoughts and	 his	 emotions,	 while	 most	 women's	 thoughts	 and	 emotions	 are	 centered	 on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	man	they	love.	When	a	woman	loves,	she	could	and	would	spend	all	her	time</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	man	she	loves.	She	would	never	tire	of	love	making	(I	am	not	referring</p>
<p class="calibre1">here	to	sex	relations),	or	merely	of	being	in	the	man's	proximity.	To	woman	love</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	a	cloyless	thing.	Man	distinctly	does	tire.	No	matter	how	much	he	may	love	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman,	 too	 much	 lovemaking	 becomes	 cloying	 to	 him,	 and	 he	 wants	 to	 get</p>
<p class="calibre1">away.	 Even	 mere	 proximity,	 if	 too	 prolonged,	 becomes	 irksome	 to	 him,	 and	 he begins	 to	 fret	 and	 fidget,	 and	 pull	 at	 his	 chains,	 even	 if	 the	 chains	 are	 but	 of gossamer.	Woman	should	know	these	facts	and	act	accordingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Polygamous	Tendencies	in	Man</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">matter	 what	 our	 moralists,	 who	 try	 to	 fit	 the	 facts	 to	 their	 theories	 instead	 of fitting	their	theories	to	the	facts,	may	say,	the	fact	remains	that	man	is	a	strongly</p>

<p class="calibre1">Wide-spread	 Belief	 in	 Maternal	 Impressions—No	 Single</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well-authenticated	Case	of	Maternal	Impression—Birth</p>

<p class="calibre1">Impressions—Mother's	 Health	 During	 Pregnancy	 May</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p183"></a>Have	Effect	Upon	Child's	General	Health. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	believed	by	many	people	that	strong	impressions	made	upon	the	mother</p>
<p class="calibre1">during	 pregnancy	 may	 produce	 marks	 or	 defects	 in	 the	 child.	 This	 belief	 dates from	earliest	antiquity,	and	is	widespread	among	all	races.	The	belief	particularly</p>
<p class="calibre1">refers	 to	 the	 emotions	 of	 fright	 or	 sudden	 surprise;	 thus	 it	 is	 believed	 that	 if	 a woman	during	pregnancy	should	be	frightened	by	some	animal,	the	child	might</p>
<p class="calibre1">carry	the	mark	of	the	animal	upon	its	body,	or	it	might	even	be	born	in	the	shape</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 animal.	 Thousands	 of	 such	  <i class="calibre4">alleged</i>	 cases	 are	 given	 in	 proof.	 There	 is hardly	 a	 layman,	 or,	 particularly,	 a	 laywoman,	 who	 does	 not	 claim	 to	 know	 of authentic	cases	of	maternal	impressions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 is	 a	 thankless	 task	 to	 try	 to	 shatter	 well-established	 beliefs,	 and	 I	 do	 not hope	to	succeed	in	persuading	all	my	readers	that	all	the	stories	and	examples	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">maternal	impressions	are	untrue	and	lack	scientific	foundation.	But	I	consider	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	duty	to	state	my	belief,	whether	you	accept	it	or	not.	In	my	opinion	there	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 a	 single	  <i class="calibre4">well-authenticated</i>	 case	 of	 maternal	 impression.	 There	 is	 hardly	 a case	of	defect	or	monstrosity	where	the	cause	is	supposed	to	be	due	to	maternal</p>
<p class="calibre1">impression,	 which	 cannot	 be	 explained	 in	 some	 natural	 way,	 or	 simply	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1">accident.	Thousands	of	women	are	frightened	or	shocked	by	disagreeable	sights, </p>
<p class="calibre1">by	 crippled	 men,	 by	 animals,	 and	 still	 their	 children	 are	 born	 perfectly	 normal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	other	hand,	many	marked,	or	defective,	or	monstrous	children	are	born	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	 no	 maternal	 impressions	 can	 be	 given	 as	 the	 cause.	 So	 why	 can	 it	 not happen	when	the	mother	was	frightened	by	something	during	her	pregnancy,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 child	 was	 born	 with	 some	 mark	 or	 defect,	 that	 the	 latter	 was	 simply	 an accident	 and	 not	 the	  <i class="calibre4">result</i>	 of	 the	 impression?	 Because	 a	 thing	  <i class="calibre4">follows</i>	 another thing	it	does	not	mean	that	it	was	 <i class="calibre4">caused</i>	by	that	other	thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many	of	the	cases	given	as	examples,	and	by	physicians	too,	are	so	ridiculous</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 no	 scientific	 man	 can	 give	 them	 the	 slightest	 credence	 for	 one	 moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 a	 physician	 (Dr.	 Thomas	 J.	 Savage)	 tells	 us	 that	 he	 attended	 a	 lady	 who had	been	frightened	by	a	large	green	frog	at	or	about	the	middle	of	pregnancy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 that	 she	 gave	 birth	 to	 a	 monstrosity,	 the	 head	 of	 which	 was	 that	 of	 a	 large frog	in	shape,	with	the	eyes	and	mouth	and	even	the	coloring	of	a	frog,	then	he	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">either	 telling	 an	 untruth,	 or	 he	 shows	 himself	 as	 ignorant	 and	 credulous	 as	 any illiterate	 old	 woman	 can	 be.	 The	 doctor	 should	 know	 that	 at	 the	 middle	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">pregnancy	the	child	is	 <i class="calibre4">fully	formed</i>	and	that	there	is	no	possibility	of	an	already formed	human	being	changing	its	shape	into	that	of	an	animal.	Another	example</p>
<p class="calibre1">given	by	the	same	doctor,	and	showing	the	calibre	of	his	mentality,	is	that	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p184"></a>child	which,	when	an	infant,	not	old	enough	to	walk,	"would	crawl	over	the	floor and	 pick	 up	 little	 objects	 such	 as	 pins,	 tacks,	 small	 beads,	 without	 the	 slightest difficulty	 or	 fumbling."	 The	 reason	 for	 this	 "remarkable"	 skill	 the	 good	 doctor ascribes	to	the	fact	that	four	months	before	the	birth	of	this	child	the	mother	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	outing	in	the	woods	and	had	derived	great	enjoyment	from	gathering	hickory</p>
<p class="calibre1">nuts	 which	 she	 found	 scattered	 among	 the	 leaves	 with	 which	 the	 ground	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">thickly	covered! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Very	often	the	so-called	shock	or	fright	which	the	mother	experiences	during</p>
<p class="calibre1">gestation	is	simply	a	product	of	her	imagination.	We	know	of	many	cases	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	mothers	never	mentioned	that	anything	happened	to	them,	and	only	after	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">child	was	born	with	some	kind	of	mark	or	defect	they	began	to	hunt	for	causes</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 claimed	 that	 such	 and	 such	 a	 thing	 happened	 to	 them	 while	 they	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">pregnant,	 but	 on	 close	 investigation	 the	 alleged	 event	 was	 found	 to	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">originated	in	the	mother's	brain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 short,	 while	 the	 subject	 of	 maternal	 impressions	 is	 an	 interesting	 one	 and demands	 further	 investigation,	 there	 is	 at	 the	 present	 time	 no	 scientific</p>
<p class="calibre1">justification	 for	 the	 belief	 in	 maternal	 impressions.	 Particularly	 must	 we	 scout any	 stories	 of	 maternal	 impressions	 during	 the	 latter	 part	 of	 pregnancy,	 during the	fifth,	sixth,	seventh,	eighth,	or	ninth	month.	Because	after	the	child	is	fully</p>
<p class="calibre1">formed	 no	 mental	 or	 psychic	 impressions	 can	 make	 birthmarks	 on	 it,	 amputate</p>
<p class="calibre1">its	limbs,	or	convert	it	into	any	sort	of	monstrosity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	the	above	was	written	and	ready	for	the	printer	I	came	across	four	cases</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 alleged	 maternal	 impressions	 in	 a	 book	 by	 Laura	 A.	 Calhoun	 ("Sex</p>
<p class="calibre1">Determination	 and	 Its	 Practical	 Application").	 The	 first	 three	 cases	 the	 author relates	 without	 any	 comment,	 taking	 them	 evidently	 for	 pure	 coin.	 The	 fourth case	the	lady	investigated,	and	she	is	frank	to	say	that	what	seemed	at	first	as	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">clear	case	of	maternal	impression	was	nothing	of	the	kind	but	merely	a	case	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">heredity.	In	order	to	break	the	monotony	for	a	little	while	I	will	reproduce	here</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	four	cases	in	the	lady's	own	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 first	 was	 that	 of	 "a	 mother	 who,	 during	 pregnancy,	 was	 obliged</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	a	certain	continuous	time	to	eat	sheep's	flesh.	She	took	such	a	sudden</p>
<p class="calibre1">abhorrence	 and	 distaste	 of	 the	 meat	 that	 she	 only	 ate	 it	 rather	 than	 go</p>
<p class="calibre1">meat	 hungry.	 After	 the	 birth	 of	 her	 baby	 she	 recovered	 from	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1">spasmodic	 distaste	 of	 this	 particular	 meat.	 But	 the	 child	 from	 its	 first</p>
<p class="calibre1">meat-eating	 days	 could	 not	 endure	 the	 smell	 or	 the	 taste	 of	 the	 sheep's</p>
<p class="calibre1">flesh.	 Whenever	 the	 child	 attempted	 to	 eat	 that	 meat,	 the	 result	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">always	 the	 same—indigestion	 and	 want	 of	 assimilation,	 and	 usually</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p185"></a>attended	with	acute	indigestion	cramps." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	second	case	"another	pregnant	mother's	particular	'longing'	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	mackerel.	Her	baby	was	born	with	what	seemed	to	be	the	outlines,	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 brownish	 color,	 of	 a	 mackerel	 on	 its	 side,	 and	 which	 design	 never</p>
<p class="calibre1">faded	in	after	years,	and	the	child's	ability	to	eat	and	digest	mackerel	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	than	normal." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 third	 case:	 "The	 'longing'	 of	 another	 pregnant	 mother	 was	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1">brains	 to	 eat.	 This	 was	 provided	 for	 her.	 But	 as	 she	 was	 slowly</p>
<p class="calibre1">approaching	 the	 dish	 of	 deliciously	 prepared	 food,	 quivering	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">delight	and	with	the	eagerness	of	a	child	to	be	eating	it,	a	cat	sprang	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 plate	 and	 before	 she	 could	 prevent	 it	 ate	 the	 brains	 and	 licked	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">plate	clean.	She	 wept	 as	 a	 child	 might	 have	 done,	 and	 was	 as	 unhappy</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 brokenhearted	 over	 this	 fate	 of	 the	 brains	 food	 for	 which	 she	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">waited	with	such	keen	anticipation	of	satisfaction	as	a	little	child	might</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	been.	Shortly	after	that	the	little	baby	was	born,	and	upon	one	of	its</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulder-blades	was	a	representation	of	the	mess	of	brains,	designed	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">brownish	outlines,	and	which	did	not	fade	as	the	child	grew	up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fourth	case:	"There	lived	in	a	little	house	in	the	midst	of	a	flower</p>
<p class="calibre1">garden,	that	in	its	turn	gave	into	a	wide-spreading	orchard,	a	loving	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">loyal	husband	and	wife	with	their	firstborn	child.	The	wife	was	now	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 first	 months	 of	 pregnancy	 with	 her	 second	 child.	 Their	 nearest</p>
<p class="calibre1">neighbor	 was	 a	 Mexican	 family,	 among	 the	 members	 of	 which	 was	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">dashing	 young	 man	 of	 about	 twenty-two.	 He	 and	 his	 sister	 and	 mother</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 frequent	 visitors	 to	 this	 little	 household	 of	 three.	 But	 the	 young</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mexican	was	the	most	frequent,	and	the	husband's	being	home	or	not	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	disconcert	him.	Men	of	affairs	must	need	spend	morning	hours,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sometimes	 afternoon	 hours,	 too,	 inside	 of	 offices,	 but	 wealthy	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">aristocratic	young	Mexicans	ride	horses	all	day,	decked	out	with	silver, </p>
<p class="calibre1">leather,	 and	 velvet	 trappings,	 both	 horse	 and	 rider.	 It	 was	 this	 lady's</p>
<p class="calibre1">custom	 to	 walk	 among	 her	 flowers	 and	 fruit	 trees.	 And	 it	 became	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">custom	 of	 this	 young	 caballero	 to	 suddenly	 appear	 before	 her	 during</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	promenades.	Her	startled	eyes	would	no	sooner	perceive	the	vision</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 his	 blazing,	 dark	 eyes	 fastened	 upon	 her,	 than	 by	 one	 pretext	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">another	 she	 made	 him	 understand	 that	 he	 was	 dismissed,	 and	 would</p>
<p class="calibre1">herself	 retire	 into	 the	 house.	 When	 she	 would	 be	 about	 to	 open	 a	 gate, </p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly	 and	 unexpectedly	 the	 young	 Mexican	 would	 appear	 on	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">other	 side	 and	 with	 gracious	 suavity	 open	 the	 gate,	 always	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p186"></a>passionate,	 dark	 eyes	 upon	 her,	 though	 his	 words	 were	 reserved	 and polite.	If	the	husband	were	present,	it	was	still	the	same.	By	every	means</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible	he	would	prolong	his	stay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	 summer	 day	 this	 lady	 was	 lying	 on	 her	 couch	 on	 the	 veranda, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sleeping,	 her	 eyes	 covered	 over.	 At	 that	 time	 she	 was	 having	 an	 eye</p>
<p class="calibre1">malady	that	was	epidemic	in	that	part	of	the	country.	She	heard	footsteps</p>
<p class="calibre1">approaching,	 but	 did	 not	 disturb	 herself,	 as	 she	 supposed	 it	 was	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">husband.	After	some	time	she	suddenly	threw	off	the	covering	from	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">face,	 and	 there	 to	 her	 astonished	 eyes	 stood	 the	 young	 Mexican, </p>
<p class="calibre1">intensely	looking	down	upon	her	with	deep	concern.	At	that	moment	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">husband	arrived,	and	the	young	man	told	him	of	a	weed	growing	in	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">locality	that	he	said	would	cure	the	eye	malady.	When	the	leaves	of	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">plant	 were	 crushed	 there	 oozed	 a	 yellowish	 milk;	 with	 about	 a	 half-</p>
<p class="calibre1">dozen	applications	of	this	milk	to	the	sore	eyes	they	were	healed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 that	 the	 young	 caballero	 would	 ride	 up	 and	 down,	 Mexican</p>
<p class="calibre1">fashion,	 in	 front	 of	 the	 house,	 drawing	 rein	 whenever	 he	 could	 get	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">glimpse	of	the	lady	or	a	word	with	her.	This	never	failed	to	annoy	her, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 also	 to	 strike	 a	 sudden,	 sharp	 terror	 into	 her	 heart.	 Always	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">appearance	was	most	unexpected,	and	always	accompanied	by	the	rapt, </p>
<p class="calibre1">passionate,	dark	gaze.	Though	he	was	a	most	clean-souled	young	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Afterward,	 when	 the	 baby	 was	 born,	 one	 of	 the	 child's	 eyes	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">marked	 by	 the	 color	 and	 fire	 of	 the	 dashing	 Spaniard's	 eyes,	 while	 its</p>
<p class="calibre1">other	eye	was	a	calmish	blue-gray	eye.	This	was	all	the	more	remarkable</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 neither	 of	 the	 parents	 of	 the	 child	 had	 such	 eyes.	 Was	 it	 a	 case	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">maternal	impression? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon	investigation	I	found	that	the	grandparents	of	the	baby's	mother</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	just	such	eyes	as	the	baby.	The	grandfather's	were	big,	dark,	flashing</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes,	and	the	grandmother's	the	mild,	blue-gray	eyes.	So	'bang!'	went	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">theory	 of	 mental	 impression,	 and	 in	 its	 place	 came	 the	 physical	 law	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">reversion." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	do	not	wish	to	be	misunderstood	as	claiming	that	a	mother's	condition	during</p>
<p class="calibre1">pregnancy	 has	 no	 effect	 on	 the	 child,	 and	 that	 she	 need	 therefore	 take	 no</p>
<p class="calibre1">precautions	and	pay	no	particular	attention	to	her	health	and	her	feelings.	This	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 so.	 But	 what	 I	 do	 want	 to	 convey	 is	 this:	 That	 if	 a	 mother's	 health	 during pregnancy	is	bad,	if	she	is	a	prey	to	worry	and	anxiety,	if	she	was	subjected	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">great	 fright	 or	 to	 a	 shock,	 then	 the	 child's	 general	 health	 may	 suffer.	 It	 may	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p187"></a>stillborn,	 or	 the	 mother	 may	 have	 a	 miscarriage.	 But	 it	 will	 not	 produce	 those specific	marks,	deformities	and	monstrosities	which	are	commonly	supposed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	the	results	of	maternal	impressions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	I	lay	somewhat	special	stress	upon	the	subject	of	maternal	impressions,	it	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">because	 I	 pity	 the	 poor	 mothers	 and	 want	 to	 spare	 them	 as	 much	 as	 possible unnecessary	worry	and	anxiety.	Besides	I	want	them	to	believe	in	the	truth	and</p>

<p class="calibre1">not	going	to	discuss	here.	The	fact	is	that	at	the	present	time	the	greatest	part	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	adult	population	of	the	world	is	married;	and	the	part	that	isn't	would	like	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be.	 And	 the	 greater	 part	 of	 civilized	 humanity	 living	 in	 a	 state	 of	 monogamic marriage,	 it	 behooves	 us	 to	 make	 the	 best	 of	 it,	 to	 get	 out	 of	 it	 the	 greatest amount	of	happiness	that	we	can,	obviate	as	much	unhappiness	as	possible,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 do	 everything	 in	 our	 power	 to	 make	 it	 permanent.	 Separation	 or	 divorce	 are remedies	 of	 last	 resort,	 and	 people	 have	 recourse	 to	 them	 when	 they	 are	 at	 the end	of	their	tether.	But	the	proper	thing	to	do	is	to	avoid	the	necessity	of	having</p>

<p class="calibre1">perhaps	 even	 desertion.	 And	 in	 the	 following	 pages	 I	 will	 endeavor,	 as	 stated before,	to	point	out	some	of	the	rocks	and	shoals	on	which	the	matrimonial	bark</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 so	 often	 shattered,	 and	 to	 offer	 the	 wives	 some	 suggestions	 which	 will	 help</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p189"></a>them	to	retain	their	husbands'	affections	and	perhaps	even	also	their	fidelity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	the	advice	is	intended	primarily	for	wives,	there	will	be	found	here	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	a	salutary	piece	of	advice	for	husbands.	Some	of	the	advice	is	applicable	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">both	 partners,	 and	 as	 to	 those	 suggestions	 which	 concern	 the	 husband	 only—it will	be	a	good	thing	for	the	wives	to	call	their	husbands'	attention	to	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	first	few	weeks	or	the	first	few	months	are	the	most	important	in	the	life</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 a	 married	 couple.	 The	 stability	 of	 the	 marriage,	 the	 future	 happiness,	 often depend	upon	the	things	which	are	done	or	left	undone	during	the	initial	weeks	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">married	life.	A	certain	understanding	must	be	reached	from	the	very	beginning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 your	 husband	 does	 certain	 things	 which	 displease	 you	 and	 which	 you	 know</p>
<p class="calibre1">should	not	be	done,	it	is	best	to	say	so	at	the	very	start.	It	is	easier	to	prevent	the establishment	of	a	habit	than	to	break	a	habit	after	it	has	been	established. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Retain	 Your	 Individuality. </b>	 The	 first	 piece	 of	 advice	 I	 have	 to	 give	 you	 is: <i class="calibre4">Retain	 your	 individuality</i>.	 It	 is	 a	 trite	 but	 perfectly	 true	 observation	 that altogether	too	many	men	who	during	courtship	were	chivalry	personified	assume</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	dictatorial	tone	as	soon	as	the	knot	has	been	tied.	They	think	that	the	wife	has</p>
<p class="calibre1">actually	ceased	to	exist	as	a	separate	human	being,	that	she	has	been	absorbed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	with	the	loss	of	her	name	she	has	lost	all	right	to	have	her	own	opinions,	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">own	tastes,	and,	of	course,	her	own	friends.	Friends	who	are	obnoxious	to	one	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	marital	partners	one	must	give	up	sometimes;	but	do	not	permit	your	entire</p>
<p class="calibre1">personality	 to	 be	 obscured.	 Explain	 to	 your	 husband	 that	 you	 are	 still	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">independent	 living	 human	 being.	 I	 do	 not	 say,	 you	 should	 at	 once	 start	 a	 fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing	 is	 more	 offensive	 to	 me	 than	 the	 militant,	 pugnacious	 woman,	 who</p>
<p class="calibre1">wears	 a	 chip	 on	 the	 shoulder	 and	 is	 continually	 ready	 to	 insist	 on	 her	 "rights." </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	with	gentleness	and	firmness	much	can	be	accomplished.	And	you	want	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">remember	that	many	husbands	act	the	way	they	do,	not	because	they	are	vicious, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 because	 they	 are	 stupid	 or	 childish.	 Sometimes	 it	 is	 mere	 thoughtlessness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	have	been	brought	up	wrongly,	and	some	of	them	sincerely	imagine	that	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">repressing	the	wife's	personality,	by	blotting	it	out,	they	are	acting	in	her	interest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	 is	 for	 her	 own	 good."	 A	 serious	 talk	 with	 a	 husband	 will	 sometimes	 have	 a wonderful	effect.	It	may	sometimes	change	entirely	the	current	of	his	thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	course	if	the	husband	is	a	cad,	a	conceited	fool,	or	a	brute,	you	can	do	nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	him;	but	fortunately	not	all	husbands	belong	to	those	categories. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Interest	 in	 Husband's	 Affairs. </b>	 Be	 interested	 in	 your	 husband's	 affairs.	 No matter	 what	 your	 husband's	 occupation	 may	 be,	 you	 should	 possess	 enough</p>
<p class="calibre1">intelligence	to	be	able	to	understand	what	he	is	doing.	It	is	almost	unbelievable</p>
<p class="calibre1">how	little	some	wives	know	about	their	husband's	profession	or	work.	It	is	a	bad</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p190"></a>thing	when	strange	women	understand	your	husband's	work	better	than	you	do, and	when	he	finds	in	them	more	intelligent	and	more	sympathetic	listeners.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">may	go	to	them	for	sympathy.	If	your	husband	is	a	scientist	or	a	research	worker</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	a	professional	man	it	is	not	necessary	that	you	be	familiar	with	all	the	details</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	his	work,	but	with	the	general	character	you	should	be.	And	if	you	can	be	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">assistance	 to	 him	 in	 his	 work,	 if	 it	 be	 only	 looking	 up	 references,	 compiling tables	and	statistics	or	merely	typewriting,	it	will	be	appreciated	by	him,	and	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">sometimes	help	to	knit	the	bonds	a	bit	closer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 is	 another	 important	 reason	 for	 being	 interested	 in	 and	 understanding</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	husband's	business.	When	the	husband	dies—and	a	man	is	not	infrequently</p>
<p class="calibre1">snatched	 away	 in	 the	 prime	 of	 youth	 and	 vigor—the	 wife	 is	 often	 left	 to	 the mercies	 of	 the	 cold	 world,	 without	 money	 and	 without	 a	 profession.	 If	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1">understands	the	husband's	business	she	can	continue	it	and	remain	economically</p>
<p class="calibre1">independent.	 This	 has	 reference	 not	 only	 to	 ordinary	 business,	 like	 stores	 or agencies,	 but	 to	 more	 or	 less	 specialized	 occupations,	 such	 for	 instance	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">publishing.	We	know	the	cases	of	two	widows	of	publishers	of	medical	journals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 their	 husbands	 died	 everybody	 was	 commiserating	 with	 them:	 what	 will</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 make	 a	 living	 from?	 But	 they	 understood	 the	 details	 of	 their	 husbands' </p>
<p class="calibre1">business,	 and	 they	 kept	 right	 on.	 And	 now	 those	 journals	 are	 financially	 more successful	than	they	were	when	the	husbands	were	at	the	helm. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Wife's	 Behavior	 Toward	 Sexual	 Relations. </b>	 I	 am	 now	 coming	 to	 a	 delicate subject.	But,	delicate	though	it	is,	it	must	be	dealt	with	unflinchingly,	because	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	probably	responsible	for	more	male	infidelity	than	all	other	causes	combined. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	speak	of	the	relation	of	the	wife	to	her	marital	duties,	in	other	words,	to	sexual</p>
<p class="calibre1">relations.	Too	many	women	regard	the	sexual	act	as	a	nuisance,	as	an	ordeal,	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	 disagreeable	 to	 get	 through	 with	 as	 quickly	 as	 possible;	 they	 regard the	husband's	demands	in	this	line	as	an	imposition,	as	unfair	or	even	as	brutal; </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	their	behavior	preliminary	to	and	during	the	act	is	such	as	to	cool	the	ardor</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 any	 refined	 and	 sensitive	 man.	 The	 reasons	 for	 this	 behavior	 on	 the	 part	 of many	wives	are	manifold;	this	is	not	the	place	to	consider	them	in	detail.	I	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">allude	 to	 them	 briefly.	 One	 great	 cause	 is	 congenital	 frigidity.	 The	 woman	 is cold,	 frigid,	 has	 no	 desire	 for	 sex	 relations	 and	 experiences	 no	 pleasure,	 no sensation	 from	 them.	 Such	 women	 are	 not	 to	 blame;	 they	 are	 to	 be	 pitied.	 But even	they	can	behave	so	as	not	to	repel	their	husbands.	(See<a href="#p169">	Chapter	XLIII</a>). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	great	cause	is	the	vicious,	prudish	bringing	up,	by	which	the	sex	act	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">regarded	as	something	unclean,	indecent,	animal-like,	brutal.	Such	Women	need</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 good	 "talking-to,"	 and	 if	 they	 are	 only	 not	 natural	 born	 fools,	 one	 good</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p191"></a>explanation	 often	 fixes	 matters.	 On	 a	 par	 with	 this	 general	 prudishness	 is	 the infamous	 idea	 promulgated	 by	 a	 few	 semi-insane,	 mentally	 decrepit	 men	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">women,	that	sexual	intercourse	is	for	the	purpose	of	propagation	only.	That	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	a	child	is	wanted	is	the	relation	permissible;	at	all	other	times	it	is	a	sin,	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">"act	of	prostitution,"	an	offense	in	the	eyes	of	God,	etc.,	etc.	Of	course	if	the	wife has	 such	 ideas	 the	 husband	 deserves	 little	 sympathy.	 A	 man	 should	 know	 what ideas	the	woman	entertains	whom	he	is	going	to	make	his	wife	and	the	mother	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 children.	 But,	 unfortunately,	 this,	 the	 most	 important	 subject	 of	 sex	 and sexuality,	 is	 never	 touched	 upon	 by	 the	 engaged	 couple	 (it	 would	 be	 so</p>
<p class="calibre1">indelicate!),	 and	 after	 they	 are	 married	 they	 often	 find	 themselves	 at	 opposite poles.	Here	also	a	good	heart-to-heart	talk	will	do	a	world	of	good.	I	have	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">several	 such	 cases	 where	 a	 little	 conversation	 or	 even	 a	 letter	 saved	 the	 couple from	disruption. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	many	cases	the	cause	of	refusal	is	fear	of	pregnancy.	In	this	case	the	wife	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">right.	 But	 the	 remedy	 is	 simple:	 give	 her	 full	 instruction	 in	 the	 use	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">contraceptive	 measures.	 Other	 causes	 are:	 excessive	 masturbation,	 vaginismus, </p>
<p class="calibre1">local	 malformation,	 inflammation,	 etc.	 But	 whatever	 the	 causes	 of	 the	 wife's</p>
<p class="calibre1">"bad	behavior"	may	be,	they	are	all	amenable	to	treatment.	Some	need	medical</p>
<p class="calibre1">treatment,	some	psychic	treatment,	and	some	nothing	but	just	a	common-sense, </p>
<p class="calibre1">heart-to-heart	talk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	I	would	emphasize:	Do	not	repel	your	husbands	when	they	ask	for	sexual</p>
<p class="calibre1">favors—at	least	do	not	repel	them	too	often.	Households	in	which	relations	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 rather	 frequently	 and	 in	 which	 the	 wives	 lend	 their	 full	 and	 eager</p>
<p class="calibre1">participation	 are	 happier	 households	 than	 those	 in	 which	 the	 sexual	 act	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">indulged	in	rarely,	and	with	grumbling	and	side-remarks	on	the	part	of	the	wife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 of	 course	 you	 should	 not	 go	 to	 the	 other	 extreme	 either.	 You	 should	 not make	 too	 frequent	 demands	 upon	 your	 husband.	 With	 a	 man	 the	 act	 means	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">good	 deal	 more	 than	 it	 does	 with	 a	 woman;	 it	 entails	 a	 great	 deal	 more	 of physical	and	mental	exhaustion,	and	a	wife	who	is	unreasonable	in	this	respect	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">sowing	the	seeds	of	discord	and	unhappiness.	She	is	sacrificing	the	future	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">present.	The	husband	is	apt	to	become	afflicted	with	satiety	or	impotence—and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	wife	may	have	to	lead	a	life	of	continence	for	much	longer	than	she	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	had	to	if	she	had	been	moderate.	In	no	department	of	life	is	moderation	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">important	as	in	sex	life.	Non-use,	insufficient	use	and	excessive	use	are	all	bad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	mutually	joyful,	eager	and	moderately	frequent	participation	in	the	sexual	act</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	contribute	most	to	a	happy	and	long	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Dainty	 Underwear. </b>	 This	 may	 be	 considered	 too	 delicate	 or	 too	 trifling	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p192"></a>subject	 to	 discuss	 in	 an	 important	 sex	 book.	 But	 nothing	 is	 too	 delicate	 or	 too trifling	that	concerns	human	happiness,	and	you	will	believe	me	if	I	tell	you	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">nice	underwear	or	dainty	lingerie	plays	a	very	important	rôle	in	marital	life.	And</p>
<p class="calibre1">every	 married	 woman	 should	 have	 as	 fine	 and	 as	 dainty	 underwear	 as	 she	 can possibly	 afford.	 A	 fine	 or	 elaborate	 nightgown	 may	 be	 more	 important	 than	 an expensive	 skirt	 or	 hat.	 Unfortunately	 too	 many	 women	 ignore	 this	 fact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Externally	 they	 will	 be	 well	 dressed,	 while	 their	 petticoats,	 drawers	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">undershirts	will	be	of	the	commonest	quality	and	of	questionable	freshness	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">immaculateness.	 And	 if	 anything	 in	 a	 woman's	 toilet	 should	 be	 immaculately</p>
<p class="calibre1">fresh	 and	 clean	 it	 is,	 I	 emphasize,	 her	 underwear.	 Silk	 and	 lace	 and	 delicate batiste	should	be	preferred,	if	they	can	be	afforded,	and	attention	should	be	paid</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	color.	As	a	rule,	a	delicate	pink	is	the	color	that	most	men	prefer.	The	sex</p>
<p class="calibre1">act	with	some	men	requires	the	most	delicate	adjustments,	and	the	condition	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 underwear	 may	 determine	 the	 man's	 desire	 and	 ability	 or	 inability	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">accomplish	 the	 act.	 I	 therefore	 repeat:	 whether	 you	 are	 newly	 married	 or	 have been	married	a	quarter	of	a	century,	be	sure	that	your	underwear	is	the	very	best</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	your	means	will	allow	you,	and	that	it	is	always	sweet,	fresh	and	dainty.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	help	you	to	retain	the	affection	of	your	husband.	I	know	that	some	allegedly</p>
<p class="calibre1">wise	ones	will	scoff	at	this	statement.	They	may	say	that	an	affection	that	may	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">influenced	 by	 the	 kind	 and	 condition	 of	 underwear	 is	 not	 worth	 having	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1">retaining.	 But	 what	 do	 these	 wise	 ones	 know!	 What	 do	 they	 know	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">numerous	subtle	influences	which	gradually	either	strengthen	or	undermine	our</p>

<p class="calibre1">eyes	 without	 hesitation.	 For	 instance,	 not	 to	 beat	 about	 the	 bush,	 though	 the subject	 is	 not	 a	 pleasant	 one,	 they	 will	 urinate	 in	 their	 husbands'	 presence,	 or they	will	let	him	see	their	soiled	menstrual	napkins,	etc.	Some	husbands	may	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind	it;	but	some	men	are	very	sensitive—men	on	the	whole	are	more	esthetic</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	women—and	an	indifference	towards	the	wife	may	have	its	origin	in	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">vulgar	 or	 unesthetic	 procedure	 on	 the	 wife's	 part.	 The	 sexual	 act,	 as	 mentioned before,	is	a	very	delicate	mechanism,	and	it	is	very	easy	to	disarrange	it.	The	act</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 micturition	 before	 the	 man	 is	 known	 in	 many	 instances	 to	 have	 instantly</p>
<p class="calibre1">abolished	the	man's	sexual	desire	which	was	present	before.	And	a	man	told	me</p>

<p class="calibre1">knowledge	of	the	fact	takes	away	their	 <i class="calibre4">ability</i>	to	perform	the	act.	It	renders	them impotent.	 It	 disgusts	 them,	 and	 disgust	 is	 fatal	 to	 sexual	 power.	 Only	 to-day	 I saw	in	my	office	a	woman	who	anxiously	begged	for	advice	and	treatment.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	been	married	five	years.	She	has	always	had	leucorrhea,	from	her	fifteenth</p>
<p class="calibre1">year	 as	 far	 as	 she	 remembers.	 Otherwise	 she	 did	 not	 suffer.	 For	 the	 first	 three years	 or	 so	 her	 married	 life	 has	 been	 a	 happy	 one.	 Then	 in	 an	 unfortunate moment	 she	 told	 her	 husband	 about	 her	 profuse	 leucorrhea,	 and	 instantly	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1">noticed	a	change	in	him.	He	could	not	fully	hide	the	expression	on	his	face.	And</p>
<p class="calibre1">since	then	he	ceased	to	have	intercourse	with	her.	He	made	a	few	attempts,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 turned	 out	 unsatisfactory	 to	 both,	 and	 she	 noticed	 that	 he	 was	 forcing himself,	 doing	 it	 against	 his	 will.	 She	 took	 some	 patent	 medicines	 and	 went	 to one	doctor,	but	without	any	results.	Now,	unless	she	could	be	cured,	she	feared</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 husband	 would	 demand	 a	 separation	 or	 a	 divorce.	 If	 you	 have	 leucorrhea</p>
<p class="calibre1">treat	it.	And	remember	you	need	not	initiate	your	husband	in	all	your	unesthetic</p>
<p class="calibre1">ailments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Loyalty.	Loyalty	on	the	part	of	the	wife	is	almost	as	important	as	fidelity.	And</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	is	in	the	highest	degree	disloyal	for	a	wife	to	talk	to	her	female	or	male	friends</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	 her	 husband's	 peculiarities,	 foibles	 or	 weaknesses.	 The	 husband's—as</p>
<p class="calibre1">well,	of	course,	as	the	wife's—peculiarities	should	be	what	we	call	a	professional</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p195"></a>secret.	 Just	 as	 a	 physician	 is	 forbidden	 to	 talk	 to	 outsiders	 about	 his	 patient's troubles,	 so	 should	 a	 wife	 not	 talk	 about	 her	 husband,	 nor	 a	 husband	 about	 his wife.	 I	 know	 of	 a	 case	 in	 which	 a	 newly	 married	 husband	 was	 temporarily</p>
<p class="calibre1">impotent	 (and	 it	 was	 the	 wife's	 fault,	 too).	 She	 spoke	 about	 it	 in	 the	 deepest confidence	to	a	close	girl	friend	of	hers.	The	friend	told	it	in	deep	confidence	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">another	friend.	And	so	it	went	around	until	it	reached	the	husband's	ears.	From</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 moment	 he	 made	 no	 further	 attempt	 to	 have	 relations	 with	 his	 wife;	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">coolness	 resulted,	 which	 led	 to	 a	 separation,	 which	 still	 persists.	 The	 wife begged	forgiveness,	but	he	was	unable	to	grant	it—he	felt	so	deeply	hurt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Flirting.	Do	not	flirt.	Men	are	apt	to	misunderstand	you,	and	you	are	apt	to	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	reputation	of	a	loose	woman	without	in	any	way	having	deserved	it.	I	do	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">say	 that	 you	 should	 always	 wear	 a	 forbidding	 expression,	 and	 should	 scowl	 at people	 who	 dare	 to	 smile	 at	 you	 or	 otherwise	 pay	 homage	 to	 your	 feminine</p>
<p class="calibre1">charms.	 But	 there	 is	 a	 difference	 between	 a	 friendly	 expression	 and	 flirting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,	when	your	husband	begins	to	neglect	you,	then	a	mild	flirtation	may</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	justifiable.	It	will	 <i class="calibre4">always</i>	do	your	husband	good	to	know	that	there	are	other males	in	the	world	beside	him,	and	that	some	of	these	males	find	interest	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">female	whom	he	considers	his	permanent	and	exclusive	property. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Slovenly	Husbands. </b>	Don't	let	your	husband	become	a	slob.	That	is	just	what	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">mean.	It	is	no	use	mincing	words.	Some	husbands	have	never	acquired	the	habit</p>
<p class="calibre1">—or	 if	 they	 have	 acquired	 it	 they	 quickly	 lost	 it—of	 regarding	 their	 wives	 as ladies.	"She	is	not	a	lady,	she	is	only	my	wife,"	is	a	well-known	joke,	but	some men	take	it	not	as	a	jest.	Some	men	think	that	before	their	wives	they	can	be	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">slovenly	 and	 unclean	 as	 they	 please.	 Give	 your	 husband	 to	 understand	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">cleanliness	 and	 freshness	 is	 not	 a	 "sex-limited"	 attribute,	 and	 just	 as	 a	 husband wants	his	wife	to	be	clean	and	dainty	and	well-groomed,	so	a	wife	may	enjoy	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same	qualities	in	her	husband.	Some	women	are	very	fastidious,	and	while	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">may	say	nothing	to	their	husbands	 for	 fear	 of	 irritating	 them,	 they	 may	 think	 a good	deal. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Carrying	Life	Insurance. </b>	Every	husband	should	carry	some	life	insurance—</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 much	 as	 he	 conveniently	 can.	 This	 should	 be	 the	 husband's	 most	 pleasant</p>
<p class="calibre1">duty,	 particularly	 so	 when	 the	 wife	 has	 no	 profession	 of	 her	 own	 and	 there	 are small	 children	 to	 bring	 up.	 The	 lack	 of	 consideration,	 the	 thoughtlessness—I</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	call	it	dishonesty—on	the	part	of	many	husbands	who	claim	to	love	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">wives	 is	 simply	 heart-breaking.	 Who	 of	 us	 does	 not	 know	 of	 cases	 of	 refined wives	 with	 children	 left	 absolutely	 penniless	 and	 forced	 into	 wage	 slavery	 or even	 into	 menial	 service	 by	 the	 negligence	 of	 their	 husbands?	 Such	 things</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p196"></a>happened	 even	 to	 wives	 whose	 husbands	 were	 making	 from	 three	 to	 ten thousand	a	year.	Thoughtlessness,	carelessness,	procrastination—and	then	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">too	 late.	 There	 is	 not	 a	 man	 who	 makes	 as	 little	 as	 twenty	 dollars	 a	 week	 who cannot	 carry	 some	 insurance.	 I	 was	 once	 poor,	 very	 poor.	 And	 the	 terrifying thought,	 What	 would	 happen	 to	 my	 wife	 and	 two	 children	 if	 I	 should	 be	 taken off	suddenly?	gave	me	many	a	troubled	and	sleepless	night.	And	when	I	took	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 thousand	 dollars	 insurance	 I	 felt	 some	 relief.	 But	 I	 felt	 it	 was	 inadequate.	 I therefore	 made	 a	 supreme	 effort	 and	 soon	 took	 an	 additional	 ten	 thousand</p>
<p class="calibre1">dollars.	And	I	assure	you	that	the	annual	premium	of	two	hundred	and	eighty-six</p>
<p class="calibre1">dollars	was	a	terrible	burden	on	me.	There	were	times	when	I	felt	as	if	I	had	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">give	it	up.	But	I	deprived	myself	of	many	necessities	(there	was	no	question	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">luxuries)	 and	 I	 paid	 my	 premiums	 regularly.	 But	 in	 compensation	 I	 had	 restful nights.	 It	 was	 soothing	 to	 know	 that	 if	 I	 should	 be	 taken	 away	 in	 my	 earliest youth	my	equally	young	wife	and	two	little	babies	would	not	be	left	penniless.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">verily	believe	that	an	adequate	life	insurance	prolongs	a	person's	life,	because	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">removes	the	worry	about	the	future	of	the	wife	and	children. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	repeat,	every	husband	should	carry	some	life	insurance.	And	the	habit	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bridegroom	presenting	the	bride	with	a	substantial	life	insurance	policy	is	a	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">good	one.	It	is	not	only	a	financial	protection	to	the	wife;	it	is	also	more	or	less	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">guarantee	of	the	husband's	fair	health. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Making	a	Will. </b>	Another	point.	Every	husband	should	make	a	will.	This	is	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">delicate	point	about	which	most	wives	would	hesitate	to	speak	to	their	husbands, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 the	 husband	 should	 attend	 to	 the	 matter	 himself.	 A	 will	 doesn't	 shorten anybody's	life,	but	is	very	convenient	in	case	of	a	sudden	taking	off.	This	is,	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">course,	 particularly	 important	 if	 there	 is	 some	 property.	 If	 the	 husband	 dies without	a	will,	there	is	endless	trouble	and	red	tape	for	the	wife.	An	executor	has</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 be	 appointed,	 she	 has	 to	 give	 bonds,	 etc.,	 etc.	 If	 the	 husband	 leaves	 a	 will making	his	wife	sole	executrix,	without	a	bond,	all	trouble	is	avoided.	I	assume, </p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 course,	 that	 the	 husband	 has	 perfect	 confidence	 in	 his	 wife's	 wisdom	 and integrity.	If	he	has	not	and	there	are	children,	it	is	just	as	well	to	designate	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">outside	executor	or	executors.	But	whichever	may	be	the	case,	it	is	a	good	and</p>

<p class="calibre1">countries	 is	 simply	 disgraceful.	 Make	 marriage	 harder	 and	 divorce	 easier,	 has always	been	my	motto.	When	life	together	becomes	unbearable	then	it	is	better</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 both	 husband	 and	 wife	 to	 cut	 the	 tie	 and	 to	 get	 divorced.	 Divorce	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">preferable	 to	 separation,	 because	 both	 spouses	 may	 be	 able	 to	 lead	 a	 new	 and happier	life.	Where	there	are	no	children	to	be	taken	care	of	a	simple	declaration</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	husband	and	wife	repeated	perhaps	after	a	lapse	of	three	or	six	months	should</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 quite	 sufficient	 for	 the	 granting	 of	 a	 divorce.	 Where	 there	 are	 children	 the state	should	make	sure	that	they	will	be	properly	taken	care	of	before	a	divorce</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	granted.	Where	only	one	party	demands	a	divorce	the	case	should	be	carefully</p>

<p class="calibre1">divorce. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes,	 I	 am	 for	 a	 sensible,	 rational	 and	 easy	 system	 of	 divorce.	 But	 I	 would always	recommend	care	and	caution.	"Go	slow"	should	be	the	guiding	motto	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">husband	 and	 wife	 in	 such	 cases.	 There	 are	 periods	 in	 a	 married	 couple's	 life when	 further	 living	 together	 seems	 unthinkable;	 and	 still	 a	 month	 or	 two	 or	 a year	 passes	 and	 the	 husband	 and	 wife	 live	 happily	 together	 and	 cannot	 believe that	there	was	ever	any	friction	between	them.	The	couples	are	very	few,	indeed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who	 never	 went	 through	 any	 squalls	 or	 storms,	 whose	 lives	 were	 not	 darkened by	disagreements,	quarrels	and	apparently	irreconcilable	antagonisms.	But	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 storm	 the	 sun	 shone	 brightly	 again,	 and	 the	 quarrels	 were	 followed	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1">harmony	 and	 peace.	 After	 that	 love	 was	 intensified.	 Were	 divorce	 a	 simple</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter,	 a	 mere	 matter	 of	 declaration,	 many	 couples	 who	 live	 now	 in	 harmony</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	have	been	divorced—to	their	great	regret	perhaps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes,	there	are	two	sides	to	the	divorce	question.	But	I	would	summarize	it	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">follows:	 Where	 there	 is	 a	 real	 incompatibility	 of	 characters,	 where	 there	 is	 no love	 and	 no	 respect,	 then	 the	 sooner	 the	 couple	 is	 divorced	 the	 better,	 and	 not only	for	them	but	for	the	children	also,	if	there	are	any.	An	atmosphere	of	hatred</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p199"></a>and	mutual	contempt	is	not	a	healthy	atmosphere	for	the	growing	children.	But where	there	is	merely	irritability,	outbreaks	of	temper,	or	disagreements	which	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">analyzed	 can	 be	 seen	 to	 be	 due	 to	 temporary	 and	 remediable	 causes,	 then	 "Go slow,"	 "Don't	 hurry,"	 should	 be	 your	 motto.	 There	 will	 always	 be	 time	 to	 get	 a divorce.	 While	 if	 a	 divorce	 has	 been	 obtained,	 even	 if	 you	 regret	 it,	 you	 will most	likely	stay	divorced.	Many	divorced	couples,	I	imagine,	would	remarry,	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	were	not	ashamed.	They	fear	it	would	make	them	ridiculous—and	it	would</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Outsiders	in	Domestic	Tangles</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">If	you	have	a	disagreement	with	your	husband,	try	to	straighten	out	the	tangle</p>
<p class="calibre1">yourself.	Don't	call	in	outside	help.	You	will	regret	it.	A	stranger's	paws	are	too</p>

<p class="calibre1">Altogether	 outsiders	 are	 not	 fit	 to	 mix	 in	 the	 internal	 differences	 between</p>
<p class="calibre1">husband	and	wife.	It	is	absolutely	impossible	for	a	stranger	to	know	just	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 trouble	 is	 and	 who	 the	 guilty	 party	 is.	 Sometimes	 there	 is	 no	 guilty	 party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both	 husband	 and	 wife	 may	 be	 right;	 they	 may	 both	 be	 lovely	 people	 and	 still together	they	may	form	an	incompatible,	explosive	mixture.	And	then	again	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">party	 that	 to	 outsiders	 may	 seem	 the	 angelic	 one	 may	 in	 reality	 be	 the	 devilish one.	It	is	a	well-known	fact	that	people	who	to	the	outside	world	may	seem	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">personification	 of	 honor	 and	 good	 nature	 may	 be	 very	 devils	 at	 home.	 I	 have long	 ago	 given	 up	 not	 only	 meddling	 in,	 but	 even	 judging,	 domestic</p>
<p class="calibre1">disharmonies.	For	it	is	almost	impossible	for	an	outsider	to	judge	justly.	I	knew	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">husband	 who	 was	 considered	 a	 paragon	 of	 virtue.	 And	 when	 a	 clash	 came</p>
<p class="calibre1">between	him	and	his	wife	everybody	was	inclined	to	blame	the	wife.	But	it	came</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	later	that	the	husband	had	certain	ways	about	him	which	made	the	wife's	life</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 very	 torture.	 And	 vice	 versa.	 I	 know	 of	 another	 case	 where	 the	 wife	 was considered	the	sweetest	thing	in	the	world.	She	had	nice	ways	about	her,	but	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">disliked	 her	 husband	 and	 made	 his	 life	 a	 hell.	 With	 genuine	 chivalry	 he	 bore everything,	 believing	 that	 it	 was	 a	 man's	 duty	 to	 bear	 his	 cross.	 She	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">unfaithful	to	him,	but	she	was	so	clever	and	cunning	that	neither	he	nor	anybody</p>
<p class="calibre1">else	 suspected	 it.	 The	 fact	 became	 painfully	 patent	 to	 him,	 when	 on	 one	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p200"></a>rare	occasions	that	they	came	together	she	infected	him	with	a	venereal	disease, which	incapacitated	him	for	a	long	time.	Nobody	knew	why	he	insisted	upon	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">separation,	and	everybody,	with	the	exception	of	his	physician	and	perhaps	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	two	others,	was	blaming	him	for	an	unfeeling	brute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 will	 therefore	 repeat	 that	 as	 a	 general	 thing	 domestic	 tangles	 should	 be</p>

<p class="calibre1">diametrically	opposite,	opinions	as	to	what	constitutes	Love.	One	opinion	is	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Love	 is	 sexual	 love,	 sexual	 attraction,	 sexual	 desire.	 To	 people	 holding	 this opinion	 love	 and	 sexual	 desire	 or	 "lust"	 are	 synonymous.	 And	 they	 laugh	 and sneer	at	any	attempt	to	idealize	love,	to	present	it	as	something	finer	and	subtler, </p>
<p class="calibre1">let	 alone	 nobler,	 than	 mere	 sex	 attraction.	 The	 writer	 has	 heard	 one	 cynical woman—and	more	than	one	man—say:	Love?	There	is	no	such	a	thing.	Sexual</p>
<p class="calibre1">intercourse	is	love,	and	that's	all	there	is	to	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 other	 opinion	 is	 that	 Love,	 true	 love,	 ideal	 love,	 or,	 as	 it	 is	 sometimes called,	 sentimental	 love,	 or	 platonic	 love,	 has	 nothing	 to	 do	 with	 sexual	 desire, with	 sexual	 attraction.

<p class="calibre1">Both	 opinions,	 as	 is	 often	 the	 case	 with	 extreme	 and	 one-sided	 opinions,	 are wrong.	Both	opinions	have	a	reason	for	their	existence,	because	there	is	a	grain</p>

<p class="calibre1">many	years	of	thinking	and	many	years	of	observing. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Foundation	of	Love. </b>	The	 <i class="calibre4">foundation</i>,	the	 <i class="calibre4">basis</i>	of	all	love	is	sexual	attraction. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p202"></a>Without	 sexual	 attraction,	 in	 greater	 or	 lesser	 degree,	 there	 can	 be	 no	 love. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where	the	former	is	entirely	lacking	the	latter	can	have	no	existence.	This	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">may	take	as	an	axiom.	Some	may	call	it	love,	but	on	analyzing	it	you	will	find</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 it	 is	 no	 such	 thing.	 It	 may	 be	 friendship,	 it	 may	 be	 gratitude,	 it	 may	 be respect,	it	may	be	pity,	it	may	be	habit,	it	may	even	be	a	 <i class="calibre4">desire</i>	or	a	 <i class="calibre4">readiness</i>	to love	or	to	be	loved,	but	it	is	not	love.	Experience	has	proved	it	in	thousands	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">thousands	 of	 sad	 cases.	 And	 the	 girl	 who	 marries	 a	 man	 who	 is	 physically</p>
<p class="calibre1">repulsive	to	her,	who	possesses	 <i class="calibre4">no</i>	physical	sexual	attraction	for	her,	though	she may	experience	for	him	all	of	the	feelings	mentioned	above,	namely,	friendship, </p>
<p class="calibre1">gratitude,	 respect	 and	 pity,	 is	 preparing	 for	 herself	 a	 joyless	 couch	 to	 sleep	 on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unless,	 indeed,	 she	 happens	 to	 belong	 to	 the	 class	 of	 women	 whom	 we	 call</p>
<p class="calibre1">frigid,	that	is,	if	she	is	herself	devoid	of	any	sexual	desire	and	feels	no	need	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	 sexual	 relations.	 Such	 a	 woman	 may	 be	 fairly	 or	 even	 quite	 happy	 with	 a husband	who	repels	her	physically,	but	whom	she	likes	or	respects.	And	what	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	 about	 the	 wife	 applies	 with	 still	 greater	 force	 to	 the	 husband.	 A	 man	 who marries	a	woman	who	is	physically	antipathetic	to	him	is	a	criminal	fool. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 repeat,	 sexual,	 physical	 attraction	 is	 the	  <i class="calibre4">basis</i>,	 the	 foundation	 of	 love.	 It	 is true	 we	 see	 certain	 cases	 of	 love	 which	 puzzle	 us.	 We	 cannot	 understand	 what</p>
<p class="calibre1">"he"	has	seen	in	"her"	or	what	"she"	has	seen	in	"him."	But	let	us	remember	this paradox,	which	paradoxical	though	it	be,	is	true	nevertheless:	Love	is	blind,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">Love	 also	 sees	 acutely	 and	 penetratingly;	 it	 sees	 things	 which	 we	 who	 are</p>
<p class="calibre1">indifferent	cannot	see.	The	blindness	of	Love	helps	her	not	to	see	certain	defects</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	are	clearly	seen	to	everybody	else;	but,	on	the	other	hand,	her	penetrating</p>
<p class="calibre1">vision	 helps	 her	 to	 see	 good	 qualities	 which	 are	 invisible	 to	 others.	 And	 a homely	 person	 may	 possess	 certain	 compensating	  <i class="calibre4">physical</i>	 qualities—such	 as passionate	ardor	or	strong	sexual	power—which,	render	him	or	her	irresistible	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	member	of	the	opposite	sex. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 homeliness,	 ugliness	 or	 deformity	 have	 their	 limits,	 and	 I	 challenge</p>
<p class="calibre1">anybody	to	bring	forth	an	authenticated	case	in	which	a	man	fell	in	love	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman—or	 vice	 versa—who	 had	 an	 enormous	 tumor	 on	 one	 side	 of	 the	 face, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which	made	her	look	like	a	monstrosity,	or	whose	nose	was	sunk	in	as	a	result	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">lupus	 or	 syphilis,	 or	 whose	 cheek	 was	 eaten	 away	 by	 cancer.	 Love	 under	 such circumstances	 is	 an	 absolute	 impossibility,	 because	 there	 is	 physical	 aversion here,	 and	 physical	 aversion	 is	 fatal	 to	 the	  <i class="calibre4">genesis</i>	 of	 love.	 A	 man	 who	 loved	 a woman	may	continue	to	love	her	after	she	has	become	disfigured	by	disease,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	cannot	fall	in	love	with	such	a	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 will	 repeat,	 then,	 and	 I	 trust	 you	 will	 agree	 with	 me	 on	 this	 point:	 sexual</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p203"></a>attraction	is	the	foundation	of	all	love	between	the	opposite	sexes.	Where	sexual attraction	is	lacking	you	can	give	the	feeling	any	other	name	you	choose:	it	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	be	love. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Other	 Requisites. </b>	 But	 a	 foundation	 is	 not	 a	 whole	 structure.	 To	 insure	 the stability	of	a	high	intricate	building	we	must	give	it	a	good	solid	foundation;	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 foundation	 does	 not	 make	 the	 building.	 That	 still	 remains	 to	 be	 built.	 So sexual	 attraction	 is	 the	 foundation	 of	 all	 love,	 but	 it	 does	  <i class="calibre4">not</i>	 constitute	 love. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many	 more	 factors,	 many	 more	 wonderful	 stones	 are	 needed	 before	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wonderful	 structure	 called	 love	 is	 brought	 into	 existence.	 This	 wonderful</p>
<p class="calibre1">structure	sometimes	goes	up	in	the	twinkling	of	an	eye,	as	if	by	the	touch	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">magic	wand—who	has	not	seen	or	heard	of	instances	of	"love	at	first	sight!"—</p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 the	 rapidity	 of	 the	 growth	 of	 the	 structure	 called	 Love	 does	 not	 militate against	 our	 assertion	 that	 many	 stones,	 much	 variegated	 material,	 and	 a	 strong cement	are	needed	for	its	completion.	Fairies	sometimes	work	very	quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 little	 thought	 will	 show	 clearly	 that	 Love	 is	 not	 merely	 sexual	 love,	 not merely	a	desire	to	gratify	the	sexual	instinct.	If	love	were	merely	sexual	desire, </p>
<p class="calibre1">then	one	member	of	the	opposite	sex,	or	at	least	one	attractive	member,	would	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	good	as	any	other.	And	indeed	in	animals	and	in	the	lower	races,	where	love</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	we	understand	it	does	not	exist,	this	is	the	case.	To	a	male	dog	any	female	dog</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	as	good	as	another,	and	vice	versa.	Cats	are	not	particular	in	the	choice	of	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">mates,	 nor	 are	 cows,	 horses,	 etc.	 And	 the	 same	 is	 true	 of	 the	 primitive	 savage races,	and	even	among	the	lower	uneducated	classes	of	so-called	civilized	races. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	 the	 Hottentot,	 to	 the	 Australian	 bushman	 or	 to	 the	 Russian	 peasant	 one</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman	is	as	good	as	another.	If	the	male	of	a	low	race	has	some	preference,	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	be	in	favor	of	the	woman	who	happens	to	have	a	little	property. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 fact	 I	 make	 the	 assertion	 that	 real	 love,	 true	 love,	 is	 a	 new	 feeling,	 a comparatively	modern	feeling,	absent	in	the	lower	races	and	reaching	its	highest</p>
<p class="calibre1">development	only	in	people	of	high	civilization,	culture	and	education. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 platitudinous	 objection	 might	 be	 raised	 that	 "human	 nature	 is	 human</p>
<p class="calibre1">nature,"	that	all	our	feelings	are	born	with	us,	and	as	such	are	inherited,	that	they have	 been	 with	 us	 for	 millions	 of	 years	 and	 that	 we	 cannot	 possibly	  <i class="calibre4">originate</i> any	 entirely	 new	 feeling.	 True	 from	 a	 certain	 viewpoint.	 We	 cannot	 originate intellect	 either.	 The	 germ	 of	 intellect	 with	 all	 its	 potential	 possibilities	 was present	in	our	most	primitive	tree-climbing	ancestors.	But	as	much	difference	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	 is	 between	 the	 intellect	 of	 an	 Australian	 bushman	 and	 the	 intellect	 of	 a Spinoza,	a	Shakespeare,	a	Darwin,	a	Victor	Hugo,	a	Goethe	or	a	Gauss,	so	much</p>
<p class="calibre1">difference	 is	 there	 between	 the	 love	 of	 a	 primitive	 savage	 and	 the	 love	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p204"></a>highly	 cultured	 modern	 man.	 The	 love	 or	 so-called	 love	 of	 the	 primitive	 or ignorant	man	(and	woman)	is	a	simple	matter	and	is	practically	equivalent	to	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">desire	for	sexual	gratification.	The	love	of	the	truly	cultured	and	highly	civilized</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	 and	 woman,	 while	 still	  <i class="calibre4">based</i>	 on	 sexual	 attraction,	 is	 so	 complex	 and	 so dominating	 a	 feeling	 that	 it	 completely	 defies	 all	 analysis,	 all	 attempts	 at dissection,	as	it	defies	all	attempts	at	synthesis,	at	artificial	building	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	previously	stated,	some	writers	attempt	to	make	a	clear	distinction	between</p>
<p class="calibre1">sensual	 and	 sentimental	 love;	 many	 reams	 of	 paper	 have	 been	 used	 up	 in	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">endeavor	 to	 differentiate	 between	 one	 and	 the	 other;	 the	 first	 is	 called	 animal love	or	lust;	the	second	pure	love	or	ideal	love;	the	first	variety	of	love	is	said	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	selfish,	egotistic,	the	other—self-sacrificing,	altruistic.	These	distinctions	read</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	 nicely,	 but	 they	 mean	 very	 little.	 There	 is	 no	 distinct	 line	 of	 demarkation between	the	two	varieties	of	love,	and	one	merges	imperceptibly	into	the	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most,	if	not	all,	of	our	apparently	altruistic	actions	and	feelings	have	an	egotistic</p>
<p class="calibre1">substratum;	and	the	quality	of	the	love	depends	upon	the	lover.	In	other	words, </p>
<p class="calibre1">there	 are	 not	 two	 separate,	 distinct	 varieties	 of	 love,	 but	 there	 are	 separate, distinct	 varieties	 of	 men.	 A	 fine	 and	 noble	 man	 will	 love	 finely	 and	 nobly;	 a coarse	 and	 brutal	 man	 will	 love	 coarsely	 and	 brutally.	 A	 man	 who	 is	 fine	 and noble	may	not	love	at	all,	but	he	cannot	love	coarsely	and	selfishly;	and	a	coarse</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	brutal	man	can	never	love	nobly	and	unselfishly.	Which	once	more	means:</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	difference	is	not	inherent	in	the	love,	but	in	the	lover. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 to	 say	 that	 a	 man	 may	 deeply	 love	 a	 woman	 and	 not	 have	 any	 sexual</p>
<p class="calibre1">desire	 for	 her	 is	 nonsense.	 A	 man	 who	 loves	 a	 woman	 and	 does	 not	 want	 to possess	her	(to	use	the	ugly	ancient	verb)	does	not	love	her—or	he	is	completely</p>
<p class="calibre1">impotent.	 Whatever	 the	 feeling	 may	 be	 for	 her—it	 is	 not	 love.	 He	 may	 abstain from	 having	 sex	 relations	 with	 her	 if	 the	 circumstances	 are	 such	 that	 sex</p>
<p class="calibre1">relations	may	lead	to	her	unhappiness	and	suffering,	but	to	refrain	from	doing	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing,	when	reason	and	judgment	lead	us	to	refrain,	does	not	mean	not	to	want</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Love	 at	 First	 Sight. </b>	 Nothing	 is	 more	 firmly	 established	 than	 the	 fact	 that	 a person	may	fall	passionately	and	incurably	in	love	with	a	person	of	the	opposite</p>
<p class="calibre1">sex	 at	 the	 very	 first	 sight,	 in	 the	 twinkling	 of	 an	 eye,	 in	 the	 literal	 sense	 of	 the word.	One	glance	may	be	sufficient.	And	such	a	love	may	exist	to	the	end	of	life, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	may,	if	reciprocated,	lead	to	supreme	happiness,	or	if	unreciprocated	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">deepest	unhappiness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	it	is	that	causes	love	at	first	sight	is	unknown.	Some	have	suggested	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 beloved	 object	 sets	 in	 motion	 or	 fermentation	 certain	 internal	 secretions</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p205"></a>(hormones)	in	the	lover	which	cannot	become	"satisfied"	or	"neutralized"	except by	 that	 person;	 and	 the	 possession	 of	 the	 beloved	 object	 becomes	 a	 physical necessity.	This	explanation	really	means	nothing.	It	is	a	hypothesis	unsusceptible</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 proof.	 But	 whatever	 the	 cause	 of	 love	 at	 first	 sight,	 it	 is	 so	 mysterious	 a phenomenon	that	it	gives	the	mystics	and	metaphysicians	some	justification	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 talk	 about	 "electric	 currents"	 and	 "magnetic	 forces."	 These	 phrases	 also mean	 nothing,	 but	 are	 an	 attempt	 at	 explaining	 the	 suddenness	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">irresistibleness	 of	 the	 attack.	 So	 powerful	 is	 the	 attraction	 of	 love	 at	 first	 sight that	 people	 have	 been	 known	 to	 cross	 continents	 and	 oceans	 merely	 to	 get	 a glimpse	 of	 the	 beloved	 object;	 and	 people	 have	 been	 known	 to	 sacrifice</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">everything</i>—their	 career,	 their	 material	 possessions,	 their	 social	 standing,	 their honor,	 and	 even	 their	 wife	 and	 children,	 in	 order	 to	 gain	 their	 object.	 And	 a mother	 may	 give	 up	 her	 children	 whom	 she	 loves	 dearer	 than	 life,	 may	 risk</p>
<p class="calibre1">ostracism	 and	 disgrace,	 only	 in	 order	 to	 be	 with	 the	 object	 of	 her	 love.	 This shows	 that	 love,	 then,	 becomes	 pathological,	 because	 any	 feeling	 which	 so</p>
<p class="calibre1">completely	masters	an	individual	that	he	is	willing	to	sacrifice	everything	he	has</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	world	is	pathological. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Infatuation	and	Being	in	Love. </b>	While,	as	said,	the	feeling	of	love	does	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">readily	lend	itself	to	dissection,	to	analysis,	still	we	can	differentiate	some	phases</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 it.	 We	 can	 differentiate	 between	 "being	 in	 love,"	 "infatuation,"	 and	 "love." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Being	 in	 love	 is,	 as	 just	 indicated,	 a	 pathological,	 morbid	 phenomenon.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">person	who	is	in	love	is	not	in	a	normal	condition.	He	can	see	nothing,	he	cannot</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 argued	 with,	 as	 far	 as	 his	 love	 is	 concerned.	 She	 is	 the	 acme	 of	 perfection, physical,	 mental,	 and	 spiritual;	 nobody	 can	 be	 compared	 with	 her.	 And,	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">course,	 the	 man	 is	 anxiously	 eager	 to	 marry	 the	 object	 of	 his	 love—unless</p>
<p class="calibre1">insuperable	 obstacles	 are	 in	 the	 way;	 for	 instance,	 if	 the	 man	 happens	 to	 be married. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Infatuation	 may	 be	 as	 strong	 as	 any	 "being	 in	 love"	 feeling.	 But	 with	 this difference.	In	infatuation	the	man	may	know	that	the	object	of	infatuation	is	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">unworthy	one,	he	may	despise	her,	he	may	hate	her,	he	may	pray	for	her	death, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 may	 do	 his	 utmost	 to	 overcome	 the	 infatuation.	 In	 short,	 infatuation	 is	 a feeling,	 chiefly	 physical,	 which	 the	 man	 can	 analyze,	 the	 unworthiness	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">absurdity	 of	 which	 he	 may	 acknowledge,	 but	 which	 he	 is	 unable	 to	 resist	 or overcome.	 He	 feels	 himself	 bewitched;	 he	 feels	 himself	 caught	 in	 a	 net,	 he	 is anxious	to	tear	asunder	the	meshes	of	the	net,	but	is	not	strong	enough	to	do	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	this	is	a	pretty	good	way	to	differentiate	between	being	in	love	and	being</p>
<p class="calibre1">infatuated.	If	in	love	the	man	does	not	want	to	be	free	from	his	chains;	he	does</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p206"></a>not	want	to	cease	to	love	or	to	be	in	love.	When	infatuated	the	man	often	uses	his utmost	will-power	to	break	his	shackles.	Sexual	satisfaction	is	often	sufficient	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">shatter	 an	 infatuation;	 it	 is	 not	 sufficient	 to	 destroy	 love—it	 often	 strengthens and	eternalizes	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neither	 being	 in	 love	 nor	 infatuation	 can	 last	 "forever";	 they	 are	 acute maladies	 of	 high	 tension	 and	 relatively	 short	 duration.	 Infatuation	 may	 change into	 indifference	 or	 disgust;	 "being	 in	 love"	 may	 change	 into	 indifference, hatred,	or	into	real	love—a	steady,	durable	love. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	will	answer	the	often	asked	question:	How	do	marriages	turn	out	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	the	result	of	a	sudden,	violent	passion,	or	of	love	at	first	sight?	No	ironclad</p>
<p class="calibre1">rules	 suitable	 for	 all	 cases	 can	 be	 given.	 Some	 turn	 out	 very	 unhappily,	 the couple	gradually	finding	out	that	they	are	altogether	unsuited	to	each	other,	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 temperaments	 are	 incompatible,	 that	 their	 views,	 ideas,	 likes	 and	 dislikes are	different.	In	some	cases	what	was	supposed	to	be	a	great	love	is	soon	seen	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 been	 merely	 an	 infatuation.	 And	 satiety	 and	 disgust	 follow.	 But	 in	 other cases,	as	mentioned,	the	sudden	consuming	passion	turns	into	a	warm,	life-long</p>
<p class="calibre1">love	and	the	people	live	happily	ever	after. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	 Nyström	 relates	 the	 case	 of	 a	 prominent	 physician	 of	 France,	 of	 high</p>
<p class="calibre1">social	and	scientific	standing,	who	beheld	a	young	girl	accidentally	in	the	street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	did	not	have	the	slightest	idea	who	she	was.	He	was	irresistibly	attracted	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">her.	 He	 followed	 her,	 boarded	 the	 same	 omnibus	 and	 went	 to	 the	 house	 which she	entered,	rang	the	bell,	introduced	himself,	begging	pardon	for	his	intrusion, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 was	 dismissed.	 He	 returned	 and	 explained	 to	 her	 his	 ardent	 passion	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">asked	 permission	 to	 visit	 her	 parents,	 well-to-do	 people	 in	 the	 country,	 and	 the climax	was	a	mutual	love	and	a	happy	marriage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many	of	us	know	of	similar	cases.	But	as	a	rule	the	slow	developing	love	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	reliable	than	the	suddenly	bursting	out	flame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Love	 is	 the	 most	 complex,	 the	 most	 mysterious,	 the	 most	 unanalyzable	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">human	 emotions.	 It	 is	 based	 upon	 the	 difference	 in	 sex—upon	 the	 attraction	 of one	sex	for	another.	It	is	fostered	by	physical	beauty,	by	daintiness,	by	a	normal</p>
<p class="calibre1">sexuality,	 by	 a	 fine	 character,	 by	 high	 aspirations,	 by	 culture	 and	 education,	 by common	 interests,	 by	 kindness	 and	 consideration,	 by	 pity,	 by	 habit	 and	 by	 a thousand	 other	 subtle	 feelings,	 qualities	 and	 actions,	 which	 are	 difficult	 of classification	or	enumeration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 great	 love,	 greatly	 reciprocated,	 is	 in	 itself	 capable	 of	 rendering	 a	 human</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p207"></a>being	 supremely	 happy.  <i class="calibre4">Nothing	 else	 is. </i>	 Other	 things,	 such	 as	 wealth,	 power, fame,	 success,	 great	 discoveries,	 may	 give	 supreme	 satisfaction,	 great</p>
<p class="calibre1">contentment,	 but	 supreme,	 buoyant	 happiness	 is	 the	 gift	 of	 a	 great	 love	 only. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such	loves	are	rare,	and	the	mortals	that	achieve	it	are	the	envy	of	the	gods.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 great	 love,	 unreciprocated,	 especially	 when	 admixed	 to	 it	 is	 the	 feeling	 of jealousy,	 is	 the	 most	 frightful	 of	 tortures;	 it	 will	 crush	 a	 man	 like	 nothing	 else will,	 and	 the	 victims	 of	 this	 emotional	 catastrophe	 are	 pitied	 by	 the	 inmates	 of the	lowest	inferno. </p>

<p class="calibre1">He	or	she	who	has	been	so	unfortunate	as	to	experience	the	pangs—or	fangs</p>
<p class="calibre1">—of	jealousy	will	readily	admit	that	it	is	one	of	the	most	painful,	if	indeed	 <i class="calibre4">not</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 most	 painful,	 of	 all	 human	 emotions.	 The	 suffering	 that	 it	 metes	 out	 to	 its victims	is	indescribable.	No	other	single	human	emotion	so	affects	the	body,	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">upsets	the	mind,	so	deranges	every	function,	as	does	jealousy.	The	torture	that	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">causes	makes	the	sufferer	a	truly	pitiable	object:	the	complete	loss	of	sleep	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">complete	 loss	 of	 appetite	 may	 result	 in	 a	 serious	 impairment	 of	 the	 sufferer's health,	while	the	rage	it	often	gives	rise	to	may	lead	to	actual	insanity,	or	at	least</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 great	 mental	 disturbance.	 With	 good	 reason	 has	 popular	 fancy	 pictured	 this cursed	emotion	as	a	green-eyed	monster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jealousy	 is	 a	 primitive	 emotion.	 It	 is	 present	 not	 only	 in	 the	 primitive	 races, but	 even	 in	 animals.	 And	 being	 a	 primitive	 emotion,	 we	 can	 hardly	 hope	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">succeed	 in	 eradicating	 it	 entirely.	 Not	 in	 the	 immediate	 future,	 at	 any	 rate.	 But we	can	modify	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	statement	frequently	heard	that	"human	nature	is	human	nature"	is	only	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">platitudinous	 half-truth.	 The	 fundamental	 part	 of	 human	 nature—the	 desire	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1">happiness	 and	 the	 avoidance	 of	 suffering—cannot	 be	 changed,	 nor	 would	 we</p>
<p class="calibre1">want	 to	 change	 it	 if	 we	 could.	 It	 would	 mean	 the	 disappearance	 of	 the	 human race.	 But	 that	 many	 of	 our	 primitive	 emotions	 can	 be	 greatly	 modified	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1">culture,	by	new	standards,	by	new	ideals	of	morality,	about	this	there	can	be	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	as	love	in	modern	man	is	an	entirely	different	feeling	from	what	it	was	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">primitive	 man,	 so	 jealousy	 in	 the	 advanced	 thinker	 is	 a	 different	 feeling	 from what	it	was	in	the	savage;	and	by	education	and	true	culture	it	can	be	modified</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	further.	We	hope	that	in	time	to	come—I	will	not	venture	to	say	how	soon</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 time	 will	 be	 here—this	 injurious,	 degrading,	 anti-social	 feeling	 may	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">entirely	or	almost	entirely	eradicated	from	the	human	breast. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p209"></a>The	 primitive	 desire—and	 this	 primitive	 desire	 of	 the	 race	 is	 still	 fully exhibited	 by	 children—is	 to	 take	 possession	 of	 everything	 nice	 or	 useful	 that somebody	 else	 has	 and	 which	 we	 have	 not.	 But	 our	 education	 and	 our	 cultural standards,	including	fear	of	punishment,	have	so	repressed	this	desire,	have	put	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	deeply	in	the	background,	that	normal	human	beings	hardly	feel	it	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	only	improperly	brought	up	people,	mental	defectives	and	those	unable	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">adjust	 themselves	 to	 their	 environment	 who	 still	 have	 this	 primitive	 feeling	 of taking	 or	 stealing.	 And	 so	 with	 many	 other	 feelings	 and	 emotions;	 and	 so	 with jealousy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	we,	at	the	very	first	notice	of	a	manifestation	of	jealousy	by	a	child,	should</p>
<p class="calibre1">frown	upon	it,	if	we	should	explain	to	the	child	or	adolescent	that	jealousy	is	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">mean,	degrading	feeling,	that	it	is	a	feeling	to	be	ashamed	of,	a	feeling	to	hide</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 not	 to	 show	 off	 or	 even	 be	 proud	 of—as	 some	 are	 now—then	 jealousy</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 manifest	 itself	 in	 a	 much	 smaller	 number	 of	 individuals,	 and	 those</p>
<p class="calibre1">unfortunate	 enough	 to	 be	 attacked	 by	 it	 would	 try	 to	 repress	 it,	 to	 hide	 it,	 to overcome	 it,	 so	 that	 it	 would	 eventually	 become	 paler	 and	 less	 acute	 and	 its consequences	 would	 be	 less	 significant,	 less	 disastrous	 for	 both	 the	 victim	 and for	 the	 persons	 concerned.	 Feelings,	 let	 us	 bear	 in	 mind,	 are	 not	 spontaneous things	uninfluenced	by	any	environmental	factors.	Feelings	are	like	plants;	under</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	 environment	 you	 may	 foster	 their	 growth	 and	 make	 them	 develop</p>
<p class="calibre1">luxuriantly;	under	another	environment	you	may	dwarf	their	growth	and	strangle</p>
<p class="calibre1">them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	order	to	enable	us	to	inhibit	the	growth	of	the	demon	of	jealousy,	we	must</p>
<p class="calibre1">learn	what	its	essence	is	and	what	factors	are	favorable	to	its	development. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Causes	of	Jealousy</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	essential	factor	in	jealousy	is	 <i class="calibre4">fear</i>.	Fear	of	losing	the	beloved	object,	fear of	 losing	 the	 person	 who	 provides	 you	 with	 sexual	 satisfaction,	 or	 the	 mere economic	fear	of	losing	a	material	provider.	The	latter	kind	of	fear	is,	of	course, </p>
<p class="calibre1">more	 often	 manifested—even	 though	 unconsciously—in	 women.	 Women	 who</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	no	love	for	their	husbands	are	nevertheless	often	fiercely	jealous,	because</p>
<p class="calibre1">consciously	or	unconsciously	they	are	afraid	that	their	husbands	may	desert	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 other	 women,	 and	 that	 they	 may	 thus	 find	 themselves	 in	 a	 precarious</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic	condition. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p210"></a>Another	 factor	 in	 jealousy	 is	 wounded	  <i class="calibre4">vanity</i>.	 We	 do	 not	 like	 to	 feel	 that somebody	is	considered	superior	to	us.	This	feeling	of	wounded	vanity	is	present</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	other	varieties	of	envy	or	rivalry.	A	person	who	loses	in	a	race	or	gets	a	lower</p>
<p class="calibre1">mark	in	his	examination	than	his	rival	may	be	filled	with	a	feeling	of	envy	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">hatred	almost	equal	in	intensity	to,	though	never	as	painful	as,	sexual	jealousy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	 factor	 in	 jealousy	 is	  <i class="calibre4">anger</i>	 over	 loss	 of	 what	 we	 consider	 our property.	 In	 our	 present	 social	 order	 the	 man	 considers	 his	 wife	 his	 absolute property,	 and	 so	 does	 the	 wife	 consider	 her	 husband.	 And	 there	 is	 anger	 that	 a stranger	should	dare	to	rob	us	or	make	use	of	our	property,	just	as	there	would	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">anger	if	a	thief	came	and	robbed	us	of	a	valuable	material	possession.	This	anger</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	rage	part	of	jealousy	is	not	a	sign	of	love.	It	is	very	far	from	being	so.	Because</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 manifests	 itself	 also	 in	 men	 and	 women	 who	 have	 not	 a	 particle	 of	 love	 for their	 spouses;	 it	 manifests	 itself	 in	 spouses	 who	 have	 nothing	 but	 hatred	 and loathing	for	their	partners. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	important	factor	is	 <i class="calibre4">pain</i>,	 pain	 that	 the	 person	 we	 love	 has	 ceased	 to love	 us.	 When	 we	 love	 a	 person	 and	 our	 love	 is	 not	 reciprocated,	 we	 feel	 pain which	may	rise	to	the	degree	of	agony,	even	when	there	is	no	rival	in	the	field. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	when	a	person	who	loved	us	has	ceased	to	love	us—or	we	imagine	so—and</p>
<p class="calibre1">has	transferred	the	love	to	another	person	that	pain	is	so	much	the	greater. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	will	digress	here	for	a	moment	to	state	that	the	fear	that	a	person	has	ceased</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	love	us	because	he	loves	somebody	else	is	often	groundless.	It	is	based	upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	erroneous	and	vicious	idea	that	a	man	cannot	possibly	love	two	women	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same	 time,	 or	 that	 a	 woman	 cannot	 love	 two	 men	 at	 the	 same	 time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Psychologists,	 particularly	 those	 who	 have	 made	 a	 special	 study	 of	 sexual</p>
<p class="calibre1">psychology,	know	that	this	idea	is	false.	They	know	that	love	may	be	directed	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 same	 time	 towards	 two	 or	 three	 individuals.	 They	 know	 that	 a	 second	 love not	 only	 does	 not	 necessarily	 destroy	 or	 diminish	 a	 first	 love,	 but	 may	 deepen and	strengthen	the	latter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	 element	 is	 pure	  <i class="calibre4">envy</i>.	 Just	 mean	 envy	 that	 somebody	 should	 have what	we	haven't,	or	what	we	have	but	are	in	danger	of	losing.	Just	as	we	envy</p>
<p class="calibre1">others	an	automobile,	a	fine	house,	a	high	social	position,	etc.,	when	we	have	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">got	them	or	have	been	deprived	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 point	 that	 I	 would	 like	 to	 mention	 is,	 that	 if	 husbands	 who	 have	 become impotent—having	lost	either	the	desire	or	the	power,	but	particularly	the	latter—</p>
<p class="calibre1">become	 jealous,	 their	 jealousy	 knows	 no	 bounds.	 No	 strongly	 potent	 man	 ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">reaches	 the	 same	 intensity	 in	 jealousy	 as	 is	 reached	 by	 a	 sexually	 weak	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p211"></a>impotent	 man.	 The	 knowledge	 that	 another	 man	 has	 displaced	 him	 and	 that	 he himself	 could	 not	 replace	 that	 other	 man	  <i class="calibre4">even	 if	 he	 were	 permitted	 to</i>	 fills	 him with	impotent	rage;	and,	as	is	well	known,	impotent	rage	is	always	more	intense</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	rage	that	is	potent.	Women	are	free	from	this	kind	of	rage,	because	women</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	never	impotent	in	this	sense.	(They	may	be	frigid,	but	they	are	never	devoid</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	 <i class="calibre4">potentia	coeundi</i>,	except	in	extremely	rare	cases	of	 <i class="calibre4">atresia	vaginae</i>	or	the absence	of	the	external	genitals.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">There	are	a	number	of	other	components	which	go	to	make	up	this	"queen	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">torments"	 or	 "king	 of	 torturers"	 jealousy,	 but	 those	 I	 have	 enumerated	 are	 the essential	ones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	 are	 they?	 Fear,	 vanity,	 anger,	 envy	 and	 pain.	 None	 of	 them	 admirable</p>
<p class="calibre1">qualities,	 none	 of	 them,	 with	 the	 exception	 of	 the	 first	 and	 the	 last,	 even deserving	our	compassion.	All	of	them	anti-social	and	anti-individual	qualities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Should	 not	 everything	 be	 done	 to	 eradicate	 such	 a	 rank	 weed,	 which	 draws	 its sustenance	from	roots	each	one	of	which	is	dipped	in	poison? </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 are	 told	 that	 in	 our	 primitive	 state	 jealousy	 was	 a	 social	 instinct;	 that	 by killing	and	keeping	away	rivals	it	helped	to	found	and	cement	the	family	and	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">keep	 it	 pure.	 I	 do	 not	 care	 to	 enter	 here	 into	 a	 discussion	 of	 this	 point.	 But whatever	useful	rôle	jealousy	may	have	played	in	the	remote	ages	(I	doubt	that	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">has),	 it	 is	 now	 an	 utterly	 useless,	 utterly	 vicious,	 utterly	 anti-social	 and	 anti-individual	 emotion.	 It	 is	 opposed	 to	 social	 life	 and	 it	 destroys	 individual</p>
<p class="calibre1">happiness.	And	everything	possible	should	be	done	to	smother	it,	to	strangle	it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">to	eliminate	it	entirely	from	human	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes,	I	find	no	compensation	whatever	for	jealousy;	I	find	no	place	for	it	in	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">modern	 life	 and	 I	 am	 in	 complete	 agreement	 with	 Forel,	 who	 calls	 jealousy	 "a heritage	of	animals	and	barbarians."	"That	is	what	I	would	say,"	he	says,	"to	all those	who,	in	the	name	of	offended	honor,	would	grant	it	rights	and	even	place	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 a	 pedestal.	 It	 is	 ten	 times	 better	 for	 a	 woman	 to	 marry	 an	 unfaithful	 than	 a jealous	husband....	Jealousy	transforms	marriage	into	a	hell....	Even	in	its	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">moderate	 and	 normal	 form,	 jealousy	 is	 a	 torment,	 for	 distrust	 and	 suspicion</p>
<p class="calibre1">poison	love.	We	often	hear	of	justified	jealousy.	I	maintain	that	 <i class="calibre4">jealousy	is	never</i> <i class="calibre4">justifiable</i>;	 it	 is	 always	 a	 stupid,	 atavistic	 inheritance,	 or	 else	 a	 pathological symptom." </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 can	 anything	 be	 done	 to	 eradicate	 this	 agonizing,	 tormenting	 emotion?	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe	 it	 can,	 and	 the	 ways	 and	 means	 to	 the	 eradication	 of	 this	 evil	 will	 be found	 on	 analyzing	 its	 components.	 We	 may	 not	 be	 able	 to	 destroy	 all	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p212"></a>components;	 if	 we	 destroy	 the	 greater	 part	 of	 them	 much	 will	 have	 been accomplished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 underlying	 factors	 of	 jealousy	 are:	 the	 primitive	 instinct,	 also	 present	 in many	 animals,	 our	 ethical	 and	 religious	 ideas	 and	 our	 economic	 system.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">primitive	instinct	we	can	repress	and	modify;	we	can	hardly	hope	to	eradicate	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">entirely.	 But	 our	 ideas	 and	 economic	 system	 we	 can	 change.	 It	 is	 easier	 to change	ideas	than	it	is	a	system,	and	it	is	with	our	ideas	we	should	commence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	first	idea	we	must	endeavor	to	destroy	is	that	it	is	impossible	for	a	human</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	to	love	more	than	one	other	human	being	at	the	same	time.	We	must	show</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 the	 love	 of	 the	 modern	 educated	 and	 esthetic	 man	 and	 woman	 is	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">exceedingly	complex	feeling,	and	that	a	man	may	deeply	and	sincerely	love	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman	for	certain	qualities	and	just	as	deeply	and	sincerely	love	another	woman</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 certain	 other	 qualities.	 Of	 course,	 love	 cannot	 be	 measured	 by	 the	 yard	 or bushel,	nor	can	it	be	weighed	on	the	most	delicate	chemical	balance.	And	it	may</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 impossible	 to	 determine	 whether	 he	 loves	 both	 women	 exactly	 alike	 or	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">loves	 one	 woman	 more	 than	 the	 other.	 But	 that	 one	 love	 does	 not	 exclude</p>
<p class="calibre1">another,	 that	 it	 may	 even	 intensify	 the	 other	 love,	 that	 is	 certain,	 and	 is	 the opinion	of	every	advanced	sexologist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Max	 Nordau,	 a	 man	 of	 high	 and	 austere	 ideals,	 a	 man	 whom	 nobody	 will</p>
<p class="calibre1">accuse	 of	 a	 tendency	 to	 licentiousness,	 says	 in	 his	 Conventional	 Lies:	 "It	 may sound	very	shocking,	yet	I	must	say	it:	we	can	even	love	 <i class="calibre4">several</i>	 individuals	 at the	same	time,	with	nearly	equal	tenderness,	and	we	do	not	necessarily	lie	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	 assure	 each	 one	 of	 our	 passion.	 No	 matter	 how	 deeply	 we	 may	 be	 in	 love with	a	certain	individual,	we	 <i class="calibre4">do	 not	 cease</i>	 to	 be	 susceptible	 to	 the	 influence	 of the	entire	sex." </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 Iwan	 Bloch,	 than	 whom	 no	 greater	 investigator	 in	 the	 field	 of	 sexology</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever	lived,	asks	the	question:	"Is	it	possible	for	any	one	to	be	 <i class="calibre4">simultaneously</i>	 in love	with	several	individuals?"	And	he	immediately	says:	"I	answer	this	question with	 an	 unconditional	 'yes.'"	 And	 he	 says	 further:	 "It	 is	 precisely	 the extraordinary	 manifold	 spiritual	 differentiation	 of	 modern	 civilized	 humanity</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	gives	rise	to	the	possibility	of	such	a	simultaneous	love	for	two	individuals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	 spiritual	 nature	 exhibits	 the	 most	 varied	 coloring.	 It	 is	 difficult	 always	 to find	the	corresponding	complements	in	one	single	individual." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prof.	Robert	Michels	says:	"It	is	Nature's	will	that	the	normal	male	should	feel</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 continuous	 and	 powerful	 sexual	 attraction	 towards	 a	 considerable	 number	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">women....	 In	 the	 male	 the	 stimuli	 capable	 of	 arousing	 sexual	 excitement	 (this</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p213"></a>term	 is	 not	 to	 be	 understood	 here	 in	 the	 grossly	 physical	 sense)	 are	 so extraordinarily	 manifold,	 so	 widely	 differentiated	 that	 it	 is	 quite	 impossible	 for one	single	woman	to	possess	them	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prof.	von	Ehrenfels	wittily	remarks	that	if	it	were	a	moral	precept	that	a	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">should	 never	 have	 intercourse	  <i class="calibre4">more	 them	 once	 in	 his	 life</i>	 with	 any	 particular woman,	this	would	correspond	far	better	with	the	nature	of	the	normal	male	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	cost	him	far	less	will-power	than	is	needed	by	him	in	order	to	live	up	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	conventional	demands	of	monogamy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	Havelock	Ellis	cautiously	says:	"A	certain	degree	of	variation	is	involved</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 sexual	 relationships,	 as	 in	 all	 other	 relationships,	 and	 unless	 we	 are	 to continue	 to	 perpetuate	  <i class="calibre4">many	 evils	 and	 injustices</i>,	 that	 fact	 has	 to	 be	 faced	 and recognized." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 have	 devoted	 considerable	 space	 to	 this	 topic,	 and	 I	 have,	 contrary	 to	 my custom,	 quoted	 "authorities,"	 because	 I	 consider	 this	 point	 of	 the	 utmost importance;	it	is	the	first	step	in	combating	the	demon	of	jealousy.	If	our	wives, </p>
<p class="calibre1">fiancées	and	sweethearts	could	be	convinced	of	the	truth	that	a	man's	interest	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	even	affection	towards	another	member	of	the	female	sex	does	not	mean	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">death	of	love,	or	even	diminished	love,	half	of	the	battle	would	be	won.	Half	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 misery,	 half	 of	 the	 quarrels,	 half	 of	 the	 self-torture,	 half	 of	 the	 disrupted homes,	in	short,	half	of	the	tyrannical	reign	of	the	demon	of	jealousy,	would	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 must	 teach	 our	 women	 and	 men	 this	 truth,	 teach	 it	 from	 puberty	 on.	 We</p>
<p class="calibre1">must	show	them	that	not	every	woman	can	necessarily	fill	out	a	man's	entire	life, </p>
<p class="calibre1">that	not	every	woman	can	necessarily	occupy	every	nook	and	corner	of	a	man's</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind	 and	 heart,	 and	 that	 there	 is	 nothing	 humiliating	 to	 the	 woman	 in	 such	 an idea	(and	 <i class="calibre4">vice	versa</i>).	She	should	be	taught	to	find	nothing	shameful,	painful	or degrading	in	such	a	thought.	I	know	that	these	ideas	are	somewhat	in	advance	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	times,	but	if	nobody	ever	brought	forward	any	advanced	ideas	because	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	advanced	there	would	never	be	any	advance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 we	 must	 teach	 our	 men	 that	 when	 they	 marry	 a	 woman	 she	 does	 not</p>
<p class="calibre1">become	their	chattel,	their	piece	of	property,	which	nobody	may	touch,	nobody</p>
<p class="calibre1">may	 look	 at	 or	 smile	 at.	 A	 woman	 may	 be	 a	 very	 good,	 faithful	 wife	 and	 still enjoy	 the	 companionship	 of	 other	 men,	 the	 pressure	 of	 another	 man's	 hand	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1">— <i class="calibre4">horribile	dictu</i>—even	an	occasional	kiss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 we	 must	 teach	 our	 men	  <i class="calibre4">and</i>	 women	 that	 there	 is	 essentially	 nothing shameful	 or	 humiliating	 in	 being	 displaced	 by	 a	 rival.	 The	 change	 may	 be	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p214"></a>disgrace	for	the	changer	and	not	for	the	changed	one.	It	does	not	at	all	mean	that the	change	has	been	made	because	the	rival	is	superior;	it	is	a	well-known	fact</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	the	rival	often	 <i class="calibre4">is</i>	inferior.	The	change	is	often	made,	not	because	the	changer has	gone	upward,	but	because	he	has	gone	downward,	has	deteriorated.	And	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">changer	often	knows	it	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inculcating	 those	 ideas	 would	 do	 away	 with	 the	 feeling	 of	 wounded	 vanity</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	is	such	an	important	component	in	the	feeling	of	jealousy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Further,	we	must	teach	our	children	from	the	earliest	age	that	jealousy	is	"not</p>
<p class="calibre1">nice,"	that	it	is	a	mean	feeling,	that	it	is	a	sign	of	weakness,	that	it	is	degrading	to the	 person	 who	 entertains	 it,	 particularly	 to	 the	 person	 who	 exhibits	 it.	 Ideas inculcated	 from	 childhood	 have	 a	 powerful	 influence,	 and	 the	 various	 ideas</p>
<p class="calibre1">exposed	above	 <i class="calibre4">would</i>	have	an	undoubted	influence	in	minimizing	the	mephitic, </p>
<p class="calibre1">destructive	 effects	 of	 the	 feeling	 of	 jealousy.	 People	 properly	 brought	 up	 will always	 succeed	 in	 controlling	 or	 suppressing	 certain	 non-vital	 instincts	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1">emotions	on	which	society	puts	its	stamp	of	disapproval,	which	it	considers	"not</p>
<p class="calibre1">nice"	or	disgraceful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	am,	therefore,	an	optimist	in	relation	to	the	eventual	uprooting	of	the	greater</p>
<p class="calibre1">number	of	components	of	the	anti-social	feeling	of	jealousy.	And	when	woman</p>
<p class="calibre1">reaches	 economic	 independence,	 then	 another	 component	 of	 the	 instinct	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">jealousy—the	 terror	 at	 losing	 a	 provider	 and	 being	 left	 in	 poverty—will</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappear. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Jealousy	 Not	 Toward	 Rivals. </b>	 Jealousy	 need	 not	 express	 itself	 toward	 a sexual	 rival	 only.	 A	 person	 may	 be	 jealous	 of	 people	 who	 can	 never	 be	 sexual rivals;	the	jealousy	need	not	even	be	of	people;	it	may	be	of	inanimate	objects,	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 person's	 work,	 profession	 or	 hobby.	 Thus	 a	 wife	 may	 be	 intensely	 jealous	 of her	husband's	mother,	towards	whom	he	is	very	affectionate	or	simply	kind	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">considerate.	She	may	be	jealous	of	her	own	children	if	she	notices	or	imagines</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 the	 father	 loves	 them	 intensely,	 or	 if	 he	 spends	 a	 good	 deal	 of	 time	 with them.	She	may	be	jealous	of	his	male	friends,	and	many	a	husband	had	to	give</p>
<p class="calibre1">up,	not	only	his	female	acquaintances,	but	his	life-long	male	friends—in	order	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">preserve	 peace	 in	 the	 family.	 A	 wife	 may	 be	 fiercely	 jealous	 of	 her	 husband's success	 and	 reputation,	 and	 cases	 are	 not	 unknown	 where	 the	 wife	 put	 every</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible	obstacle	in	her	husband's	way,	in	order	to	make	him	fail	in	his	work,	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">make	him	turn	out	mediocre	work,	all	from	fear	that	his	success	would	gain	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">admirers,	which	might	perhaps	take	him	away	from	her.	Wives	have	been	known</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	do	everything	in	their	power	to	 <i class="calibre4">exhaust</i>	and	weaken	their	husbands,	to	make</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	 physically	 unattractive,	 only	 to	 keep	 them.	 And	 so	 powerful	 is	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p215"></a>primitive,	childish,	savage	feeling,	this	desire	for	exclusive	monopoly,	that	there is	 <i class="calibre4">nothing</i>	a	jealous	wife,	sweetheart	or	mistress	may	not	do	in	order	to	retain	the man,	in	order	to	regain	him,	or,	having	lost	him	irretrievably,	in	order	to	revenge</p>
<p class="calibre1">herself.	And	what	is	said	about	the	woman	is	applicable	with	equal	force	to	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 is	 a	 huge	 mistake	 to	 assume	 that	 jealousy	 is	 woman's	 prerogative,	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">particular	characteristic,	or	even	that	it	is	stronger	in	her	than	in	man.	A	man	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	as	savagely	jealous	as	any	woman	and	suffer	the	same	tortures	of	hell. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Jealousy	Defeats	Its	Object. </b>	One	of	the	worst	features	about	jealousy	is	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	defeats	its	own	object.	We	have	been	told,	as	stated	before,	that	jealousy	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">once	 upon	 a	 time	 a	 racial	 instinct,	 that	 by	 frightening	 away	 rivals	 it	 helped	 to found	the	family	and	to	keep	it	chaste	and	pure.	Quite	the	contrary	is	true	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More	 than	 one	 man	 has,	 by	 accusing	 his	 innocent	 wife	 of	 infidelity	 and	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1">torturing	her	with	baseless	suspicions,	driven	her	into	the	arms	of	a	lover.	We	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	more	or	less	susceptible	to	suggestion,	and	by	continually	suspecting	a	wife</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 a	 love	 affair	 or	 illicit	 relation	 a	 man	 may	 implant	 the	 seed	 of	 suggestion	 so strongly	 that	 it	 may	 grow	 luxuriantly	 and	 the	 wife	 may	 be	 unable	 to	 resist	 the suggested	temptation.	And	very	often	the	very	lover	is	suggested	by	the	husband. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	don't	attempt	to	deny	it.	It	is	useless.	I	know	you	have	relations	with	X.	I know	 you	 are	 his	 mistress."	 He	 kept	 on	 repeating	 it	 so	 often	 to	 his	 absolutely blameless,	 innocent	 young	 wife	 and	 he	 made	 her	 so	 wretched	 by	 his	 rudeness</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 brutality	 that	 one	 day	 she	 did	 go	 over	 to	 X's	 rooms	 and	 did	 become	 his mistress.	And	after	that	she	could	stand	her	husband's	outbursts	with	equanimity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	I	have	the	name	I	might	as	well	have	the	game,"	is	a	good	bit	of	psychologic wisdom.	 And	 a	 husband	 should	 be	 very	 careful	 about	 even	 suspecting	 a	 wife</p>
<p class="calibre1">unjustly,	and	thus	make	the	first	step	towards	rendering	his	baseless	suspicions	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">reality,	 his	 unjust	 accusations	 justified.	 And,	 of	 course,	 what	 is	 true	 of	 the husband	 is	 also	 true	 of	 the	 wife.	 Many	 a	 wife	 has	 driven	 her	 indolent	 husband into	 the	 hands	 of	 prostitutes	 or	 mistresses	 by	 her	 incessant	 nagging,	 false</p>
<p class="calibre1">accusations	 and	 vicious	 epithets	 applied	 to	 all	 his	 female	 friends	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">acquaintances. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes,	from	whatever	angle	you	consider	it,	jealousy	is	a	mean,	nasty,	miserable</p>
<p class="calibre1">feeling.	Because	it	is	a	more	or	less	universal	feeling,	because	"we	cannot	help</p>
<p class="calibre1">it,"	does	not	render	it	less	mean,	less	nasty,	less	miserable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	do	not	for	a	moment	imagine	that	characterizing	jealousy	the	way	it	deserves</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 be	 characterized,	 calling	 it	 a	 shameful,	 savage,	 primitive	 feeling,	 etc.,	 is	 at once	going	to	banish	it	from	the	breasts	of	men	and	women	in	which	it	has	found</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	 abiding	 place;	 throwing	 epithets	 at	 it	 will	 not	 cause	 it	 to	 unfasten	 its	 talons. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p216"></a>Unfortunately,	 I	 know	 only	 too	 well	 that	 our	 emotions	 are	 stronger	 than	 our reason;	 the	 man	 or	 woman	 at	 whose	 poor	 heart	 jealousy	 is	 gnawing	 day	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">night	is	not	amenable	to	reason,	is	not	curable	by	arguments;	all	we	can	do	is	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">sympathize	with	such	a	person	and	ask	the	Lord	to	pity	him	or	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 have	 known	 a	 man	 who	 lived	 with	 his	 wife	 in	 free	 union,	 i.e.,	 he	 was	 not married	 to	 her.	 He	 did	 not	 believe	 in	 marriage.	 Love	 was	 the	 only	 bond	 that should	 bind	 people	 together;	 as	 soon	 as	 love	 was	 no	 more	 the	 people	 should separate	 in	 a	 friendly,	 comradely	 manner.	 If	 the	 wife	 or	 the	 mistress	 wants another	lover,	she	should	be	free	to	take	one;	she	is	a	free	human	being	and	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 husband's	 chattel	 slave,	 etc.,	 etc.,	 etc.,	 to	 the	 same	 effect.	 Thus	 the	 man talked.	And	he	was	sincere	in	his	talk—or	he	thought	he	was.	But	one	night	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">unexpectedly	 returning	 home	 he	 found	 another	 man;	 he	 promptly	 fired	 several</p>
<p class="calibre1">shots	at	the	man,	which	fortunately	for	both	did	not	prove	fatal,	and	then	he	beat</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 choked	 his	 wife—who	 wasn't	 even	 his	 wife	 legally—within	 an	 inch	 of	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">life.  <i class="calibre4">And	then	he	married	her</i>	and	gave	up	his	free	love	talk.	And	I	know	of	any number	 of	 men	 who	 could	 philosophize	 for	 hours	 about	 the	 disgrace	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">humiliation	of	being	jealous,	but	who,	as	soon	as	there	was	a	justifiable	cause	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">jealousy,	 became	 as	 unreasonable	 as	 a	 child	 and	 as	 jealous	 as	 any	 unlettered Sicilian	woman	ever	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	 you	 see,	 I	 am	 not	 deluding	 myself	 with	 extravagant	 hopes.	 But, </p>
<p class="calibre1">nevertheless,	 this	 argumentation,	 this	 talk,	 is	 not	 entirely	 useless.	 A	 beginning must	be	made.	This	essay	may	not	perhaps	help—except	for	the	suggestions	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	 be	 made	 towards	 the	 end—those	 who	 are	 already	 victims	 of	 the	 demon	 of jealousy,	 but	 it	 may	 help	 some	 people	 to	 keep	 out	 of	 his	 clutches	 (or	 should	 I say:	her	clutches?	I	really	don't	know	whether	the	demon	of	jealousy	is	a	male	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	female.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Feelings	are	stronger	than	reason;	but	that	does	not	mean	that	feelings	cannot</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	influenced	by	reason;	they	decidedly	can	be	and	are	so	influenced,	and	their</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">manifestations</i>	 are	 modified	 by	 this	 influence;	 and	 the	 more	 cultured,	 the	 more educated	a	person	is	(I	trust	you	will	know	that	I	use	these	terms	in	their	true	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	their	vulgar,	misused	meaning),	the	more	will	his	feelings,	or	at	least	actions, </p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 influenced	 by	 his	 reason.	 I	 am	 particularly	 a	 believer	 in	 the	 effect	 on	 our feelings	 and	 actions	 of	 public	 opinion,	 of	 ideas	 universally	 or	 generally</p>
<p class="calibre1">entertained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let	me	give	one	example	which	is	pertinent	to	the	subject.	In	former	days	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	universally	held,	and	in	many	places	it	is	still	held,	that	when	a	wife	sinned</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	committed	the	most	unpardonable	crime	that	a	human	being	could	be	guilty</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p217"></a>of	and	that	she	thereby	 <i class="calibre4">dishonored</i>	her	husband.	And	the	only	right	thing	for	him to	do	was	to	shoot	the	rival	and	cast	out	the	wife;	or	at	least	to	cast	her	out.	This</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	a	 <i class="calibre4">conditio	sine	qua	non</i>.	To	take	her	back	to	his	home	was	a	disgrace,	a	sign of	 unpardonable	 weakness,	 of	 degeneracy.	 Our	 ideas	 on	 the	 subject	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">changed	a	bit.	A	husband	is	no	longer	considered	any	more	dishonored—in	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">strata	 of	 society	 at	 least—because	 his	 wife	 sinned	 than	 a	 wife	 is	 considered dishonored	because	her	husband	sinned;	and	adultery	in	the	wife	is	now,	by	most</p>
<p class="calibre1">rational	 people,	 considered	 only	 different	 in	 degree,	 but	 not	 in	 kind,	 from</p>
<p class="calibre1">adultery	 in	 the	 husband.	 These	 humane	 ideas	 have	 gained	 vogue	 only	 within	 a comparatively	very	recent	period;	but	their	effect	has	already	manifested	itself	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 great	 number	 of	 instances.	 Forgiving	 the	 erring	 wife	 is	 becoming	 quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">common.	A	number	of	cases	have	reached	the	newspapers.	Recently	a	wife	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">implicated	in	a	nasty	scrape;	her	sin	was	not	only	unquestionable,	but	notorious; </p>
<p class="calibre1">it	was	public	property.	And	nevertheless	the	husband	stood	by	her	and	took	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	into	his	home	and	arms.	And	the	number	of	such	cases	which	do	not	reach</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	newspapers	is	very,	very	much	larger	than	the	public	has	any	conception	of, </p>
<p class="calibre1">larger	than	it	would	be	safe	to	estimate.	And	in	a	large	percentage	of	these	cases</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	husband	begins	to	treat	his	wife	with	more	love,	more	consideration,	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tie	between	them	becomes	more	firm,	more	permanent. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Jealousy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 are	 all	 agreed	 that	 prevention	 is	 more	 important	 than	 cure.	 But	 when	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">patient	 comes	 with	 a	 fully	 developed	 disease	 it	 is	 futile	 to	 speak	 to	 him	 of prevention.	 It	 is	 too	 late	 to	 sermonize.	 What	 he	 wants	 and	 what	 he	 needs	 is	 a cure,	 if	 such	 can	 be	 had.	 What	 has	 preceded	 has	 reference	 chiefly	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">prophylaxis	of	jealousy,	to	the	prevention	of	the	development	of	this	disease	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	future. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 question	 is:	 Is	 there	 a	  <i class="calibre4">remedy</i>	 for	 this	 malady?	 Is	 there	 a	  <i class="calibre4">cure</i>	 for	 this horrible	disease	of	jealousy? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 conditions	 are	 extremely	 complex,	 and	 the	 remedy	 must	 be	 fitted	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">circumstances.	Let	us	assume	that	the	husband	neglects	his	wife	and	causes	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	be	jealous,	not	because	he	is	in	love	with	another	woman,	but	because	he	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">flirtatious,	light-headed,	feather-brained	and	inconsiderate.	Such	cases	are	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">great	 majority.	 Many	 husbands	 who	 like	 or	 love	 their	 wives	 and	 who	 believe</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves	secure	in	their	love	think	it	is	quite	proper	for	them	to	hunt	for	new</p>
<p class="calibre1">conquests	and	to	carry	on	petty	love	affairs	with	as	many	girls	or	women	as	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">comfortably	 can.	 There	 is	 no	 question	 here	 about	 love—it	 is	 just	 flirtation	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p219"></a>sexual	relations.	When	this	is	the	case	the	wife	should	have	a	frank	and	firm	talk with	her	husband;	she	should	tell	him	that	she	does	not	like	his	behavior	and	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	makes	her	unhappy.	In	many	instances	this	alone	will	suffice	to	effect	a	change</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	husband's	conduct.	Where	this	does	not	suffice,	where	the	husband	is	too</p>
<p class="calibre1">egotistic	and	does	not	want	to	give	up	his	little	pleasures,	then	it	is	left	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wife	 to	 adopt	 the	 old	 and	 rather	 vulgar	 remedy.	 It	 is	 old	 and,	 as	 said,	 rather vulgar,	but	it	has	the	merit	of	efficiency:	it	very	often	works.	Let	the	wife	adopt</p>
<p class="calibre1">similar	tactics,	let	her	also	flirt,	let	her	go	out	and	come	back	at	uncertain	hours, </p>
<p class="calibre1">let	her	keep	the	husband	guessing	as	to	where	and	with	whom	she	is.	And	nine</p>
<p class="calibre1">times	 out	 of	 ten	 this,	 under	 the	 circumstances,	 fully	 justifiable	 conduct	 on	 the part	 of	 the	 wife	 will	 effect	 a	 quick	 and	 radical	 change	 in	 the	 conduct	 of	 the husband.	He	will	be	only	too	glad	to	cry	quits.	Some	people	are	utterly	devoid	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagination.	 They	 lack	 the	 ability	 of	 putting	 themselves	 in	 another	 person's</p>
<p class="calibre1">place.	 Jealousy	 particularly	 is	 not	 a	 feeling	 which	 any	 one	 can	 understand</p>
<p class="calibre1">without	 having	 experienced	 it,	 unless	 he	 is	 endowed	 with	 the	 imagination	 of	 a great	poet.	And	as	few	husbands	have	a	great	poetic	imagination,	it	is	only	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	have	felt	the	claws	of	the	monster	tearing	at	their	own	hearts	that	they	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand	their	wives'	feelings,	and	are	willing	to	act	so	as	to	save	them—and</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves,	of	course—the	cruel	tortures.	Many	wives	and	many	husbands	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">talked	to	me	and	written	to	me	on	the	subject,	and,	as	stated	before,	in	nine	times</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	of	ten	the	remedy	worked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 how	 about	 the	 tenth	 case?	 How	 about	 the	 cases	 where	 the	 husband	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">unable	or	unwilling	to	give	up	his	outside	flirtations	and	relations?	We,	advanced</p>
<p class="calibre1">sexologists,	 know	 that	 not	 all	 men,	 no	 more	 than	 all	 women,	 are	 made	 in	 the same	 mould,	 and	 what	 is	 possible	 or	 even	 easy	 for	 nine	 men	 may	 be	 very</p>
<p class="calibre1">difficult	or	absolutely	impossible	for	the	tenth.	We	know	that	there	are	some	men</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 whom	 an	 ironclad	 monogamic	 relation	 is	 an	 absolute	 impossibility.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">stimulation	 of	 other	 women—either	 the	 purely	 mental,	 spiritual	 stimulation	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 stimulation	 of	 physical	 relations—is	 to	 them	 like	 breath	 in	 the	 nostrils.	 In fact,	 there	 are	 some	 men	 whose	 very	 possibility	 of	 loving	 their	 wives	 depends upon	this	freedom	of	association	with	other	women.	They	can	be	extremely	kind</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 and	 love	 their	 wives	 tenderly,	 if	 they	 can	 at	 the	 same	 time	 associate—</p>
<p class="calibre1">spiritually	or	physically—with	other	women.	If	they	are	entirely	cut	off	from	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">association	 with	 any	 other	 woman	 they	 begin	 to	 feel	 irritable,	 bored,	 may</p>
<p class="calibre1">become	ill,	and	their	feeling	towards	their	wives	may	become	one	of	resentment, </p>
<p class="calibre1">ill-will,	or	even	one	of	hatred.	This	is	not	the	place	to	talk	of	the	wickedness	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">such	men—thus	they	are	made	and	with	this	fact	we	have	to	deal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	is	the	wife	of	such	a	man	to	do?	Two	lines	of	conduct	are	open	to	her—</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p220"></a>two	avenues	of	exit.	The	line	of	conduct	will	depend	upon	her	temper	and	upon her	ideas	of	sex	morality.	But	she	ought	to	select	the	line	of	conduct	which	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">cause	 the	 least	 pain,	 the	 least	 unhappiness.	 If	 she	 is	 a	 woman	 of	 a	 proud, independent	 temper,	 particularly	 if	 she	 belongs	 to	 the	 militant	 type,	 she	 will leave	her	husband	in	a	huff,	regardless	of	consequences.	But	if	she	is	a	woman	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	gentler,	more	pliable,	more	supple	(and	I	may	also	say	more	subtle)	type,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	she	really	loves	her	husband,	she	will	overlook	his	little	foibles,	peccadilloes</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 transgressions—and	 she	 may	 live	 quite	 happily.	 And	 the	 time	 will	 come</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	 the	 husband	 himself	 will	 give	 up	 his	 peccadilloes	 and	 transgressions	 and will	cleave	powerfully	to	his	wife,	will	be	bound	to	her	by	bonds	never	to	be	torn</p>
<p class="calibre1">asunder.  <i class="calibre4">I	know	of	several	such	cases. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">And	I	will	take	this	opportunity	to	say	that	I	have	the	deepest	contempt	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wife	who,	on	finding	out	that	her	husband	had	committed	a	transgression	or	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	has	a	love	affair,	leaves	him	in	a	huff,	or	makes	a	public	scandal,	or	sues	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">divorce.	 Such	 a	 wife	  <i class="calibre4">never</i>	 loved	 her	 husband,	 and	 he	 is	 well	 rid	 of	 her.	 And what	I	said	about	the	wife	applies	with	 <i class="calibre4">almost</i>	equal	force	to	the	husband. </p>

<p class="calibre1">other	 channels,	 may	 be	 replaced	 by	 work,	 study,	 a	 hobby	 or	 some	 engrossing</p>

<p class="calibre1">a	 love	 is	 impossible	 let	 it	 be	 a	 minor	 love	 or	 a	 series	 of	 minor	 loves.	 When Goethe,	one	of	the	world's	great	lovers,	was	unable	to	walk	in	the	broad	avenue</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p221"></a>of	 a	 great	 love	 he	 would	 walk	 in	 the	 by-paths	 of	 a	 number	 of	 little	 loves.	 The common	talk	about	a	person	being	unable	to	love	more	than	once	in	his	or	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">life	is	silly	nonsense.	A	man	or	a	woman	is	able	to	love,	and	love	very	deeply,	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">number	 of	 times;	 and	 love	 simultaneously	 or	 successively.	 It	 is	 often	 a	 mere matter	of	opportunity.	I	know	that	there	 <i class="calibre4">are</i>	loves	that	are	eternal;	that	there	are loves	for	which	no	substitute	can	be	found.	But	these	supreme,	divine	loves	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	rare	that	among	ordinary	mortals	they	may	be	left	out	of	account.	They	are	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">portion	of	supermen	and	superwomen.	Ordinarily	a	substitute	may	be	found.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">substitute	 love	 may	 never	 reach	 the	 intensity	 of	 the	 original	 love,	 it	 may	 never give	 full	 or	 even	 half-full	 satisfaction;	 but	 it	 will	 help	 to	 dull	 the	 sharp	 cutting edge,	it	will	act	as	a	partial	hemostatic	to	the	bleeding	heart,	it	will	soothe	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">anesthetize	the	wound	even	if	it	cannot	completely	heal	it.	And	this	is	a	valuable</p>
<p class="calibre1">aid	 while	 the	 sufferer	 is	 coming	 to	 himself	 or	 herself,	 while	 the	 gathered</p>
<p class="calibre1">fragments	 of	 a	 broken	 life	 are	 being	 cemented	 and	 while	 the	 cement	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">hardening.	 Yes,	 the	 man	 or	 woman	 who	 is	 in	 inferno	 on	 account	 of	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">unreciprocated	 or	 a	 betrayed	 love	 should	 lose	 no	 time	 in	 searching	 for	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">substitute	love.	I	do	not	believe	in	people	losing	their	health	and	their	minds	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">account	of	suffering	which	does	nobody	any	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	will	go	still	further.	Where	a	substitute	love—great	or	minor—cannot	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">found,	 then	 mere	 sex	 relations	 may	 help	 to	 diminish	 the	 suffering,	 to	 quiet	 the turbulent	heart,	to	relieve	the	aching	brain.	As	everything	connected	with	sex,	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	 ideas	 about	 illicit	 sex	 relations	 that	 are	 not	 connected	 with	 love,	 are honeycombed	with	hypocrisy	and	false	to	the	core.	While	purchasable,	loveless</p>

<p class="calibre1">He	was	twenty-six	years	old	and	a	senior	student	in	the	College	of	Physicians</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 Surgeons,	 Columbia	 University,	 New	 York.	 He	 had	 been	 in	 love	 with	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	considered	himself	engaged	for	four	or	five	years	to	a	young	lady	two	years</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	junior.	She	was,	of	course,	the	most	wonderful	young	lady	in	the	world,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p222"></a>whole	 world;	 in	 fact,	 there	 was	 not	 another	 one	 to	 compare	 her	 to.	 She	 was unique;	 she	 stood	 all	 alone.	 But	 for	 a	 year	 or	 so	 she	 was	 getting	 rather	 cool towards	him;	which	fanned	his	flame	all	the	more.	And	suddenly	he	received	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">note	 asking	 him	 not	 to	 call	 any	 more,	 nor	 to	 try	 to	 communicate	 in	 any	 other way.	He	did	write,	but	his	letters	were	returned	unopened.	And	soon	after	he	read</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	her	engagement	to	a	prominent	young	banker.	He	nearly	went	insane,	and	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	used	not	in	any	figurative	sense.	His	insomnia	was	 <i class="calibre4">complete</i>,	and	resisted	all treatment.	When	his	pulse	became	very	rapid	and	his	eyes	acquired	the	wild	look</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 they	 do	 after	 many	 sleepless	 nights	 an	 attempt	 was	 made	 to	 administer</p>
<p class="calibre1">hypnotics,	 but	 they	 had	 practically	 no	 effect.	 Chloral,	 veronal,	 etc.,	 only	 made him	 "dopy,"	 irritable	 and	 depressed,	 but	 did	 not	 give	 him	 one	 hour	 of	 sound sleep.	 His	 appetite	 was	 gone,	 now	 and	 then	 his	 limbs	 would	 twitch,	 and	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	sit	and	stare	into	space	for	hours	at	a	time.	To	study	or	attend	the	clinics</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 out	 of	 the	 question,	 and	 he	 did	 not	 even	 attempt	 to	 take	 the	 final</p>
<p class="calibre1">examinations.	 The	 parents	 felt	 distressed,	 but	 were	 unable	 to	 do	 anything	 for him.	The	least	attempt	at	interference	on	their	part,	any	attempt	to	console	him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">to	induce	him	to	pull	himself	together,	made	him	more	irritable,	more	morose;	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 they	 finally	 left	 him	 alone.	 He	 was	 practically	 a	 total	 abstainer,	 but	 one evening	 he	 went	 out	 and	 came	 home	 drunk;	 and	 after	 that	 he	 drank	 frequently and	heavily.	His	parents	could	do	nothing	with	him.	One	evening	on	Broadway</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	was	accosted	by	a	young	street-walker.	She	had	a	pleasant,	sympathetic	face, </p>

<p class="calibre1">solicitude	she	tried	everything	in	her	power	to	console	him,	and	he	began	to	look</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward	to	the	nightly	meeting	with	her.	His	grief	became	gradually	less	acute, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 gave	 up	 drinking,	 which	 he	 disliked,	 and	 which	 he	 had	 taken	 up	 only	 to deaden	his	pain;	he	began	to	pull	himself	together,	and	in	six	or	eight	months	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">took	over	his	last	year	in	Columbia	and	was	properly	graduated.	He	kept	up	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">friendship	with	the	girl	for	over	two	years,	when	she	died	of	pneumonia.	He	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	love	her,	but	he	liked	to	be	with	her,	as	her	presence	gave	him	physical	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">mental	comfort.	It	is	possible	that	she	loved	him	genuinely,	but	there	was	never</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	 sentimental	 talk	 between	 them,	 and	 there	 was	 never	 any	 question	 between</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	 of	 the	 permanency	 of	 the	 relationship.	 They	 both	 knew	 that	 it	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">temporary.	But	he	is	absolutely	certain	that	but	for	one	of	the	representatives	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	class	that	is	despised,	driven	about	and	persecuted	by	brutal	policemen	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">ignorant	 judges,	 he	 would	 have	 become	 a	 bum,	 or,	 most	 likely,	 he	 would	 have committed	suicide—at	the	point	of	which	he	was	several	times;	only	pity	for	his</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p223"></a>And	 here	 is	 another	 case.	 A	 girl	 about	 twenty-eight	 years	 of	 age	 fell	 in	 love with	a	man	four	or	five	years	her	senior.	The	love	seemed	to	be	reciprocated,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 soon	 became	 engaged	 to	 be	 married.	 He	 asked	 that	 the	 engagement,	 on</p>
<p class="calibre1">account	 of	 certain	 business	 reasons,	 be	 kept	 secret.	 She	 did	 not	 know	 the	 man well;	 she	 had	 met	 him	 at	 several	 entertainments	 and	 church	 affairs	 and	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	very	nice.	He	always	found	some	excuses	for	delaying	the	marriage,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">after	 they	 had	 been	 engaged	 about	 a	 year	 he	 began	 to	 insist	 on	 sex	 relations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though	of	a	refined	and	noble	character,	she	was	of	a	passionate	nature	and	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">did	 not	 offer	 much	 resistance.	 Many	 girls	 who	 would	 under	 no	 circumstance</p>
<p class="calibre1">indulge	in	illicit	relations,	considering	it	a	great	sin,	have	no	compunctions	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">having	 relations	 with	 their	 fiancés.	 They	 lived	 together	 for	 about	 a	 year.	 They were	together	almost	daily,	except	now	and	then,	when	he	would	go	away	for	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">week	or	two	on	business.	Once	he	went	away—and	never	came	back.	He	wrote</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	her	that	their	relations	were	at	an	end;	that	he	was	a	married	man	and	a	father</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	children;	he	had	hoped	he	might	get	a	divorce,	but	that	now	he	had	changed</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	mind	and	that	she	must	forget	him,	etc.	Everything	was	black	before	her.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">cost	her	a	supreme	effort	not	to	faint,	and	she	was	supported	in	this	effort	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fact	 that	 when	 the	 letter	 came	 she	 was	 in	 the	 presence	 of	 friends;	 a	 terrible, overpowering,	all-inundating	sense	of	shame	gave	her	the	strength	not	to	betray</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 condition	 and	 her	 story	 before	 the	 world	 at	 large.	 But	 as	 soon	 as	 she	 was alone	 she	 collapsed	 completely.	 There	 was	 the	 most	 absolute	 insomnia</p>
<p class="calibre1">imaginable,	 complete	 anorexia,	 but	 the	 most	 distressing	 features	 were	 frequent fainting	spells,	severe	palpitation	of	the	heart	and	tremors.	She	had	no	love	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 man—so	 she	 said.	 Her	 love	 had	 turned	 to	 hatred	 and	 contempt—but	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">jealousy	was	all-consuming.	Like	a	fire	it	was	burning	in	her,	searing	her	brain</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	her	soul	day	and	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 felt	 that	 she	 was	 not	 strong	 enough	 to	 stand	 this	 physical	 and	 mental</p>
<p class="calibre1">torture,	 and	 so	 she	 decided	 to	 commit	 suicide.	 As	 the	 means	 she	 selected	 gas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fortunately,	the	smell	became	perceptible	before	the	injury	was	irreparable.	She</p>

<p class="calibre1">than	 anything	 was	 she	 afraid	 that	 her	 mind	 would	 give	 way.	 She	 had	 a	 special horror	of	insanity.

A	 friend	 of	 hers	 then	 got	 an	 inkling	 of	 the events	that	were	transpiring,	and	she	introduced	her	to	some	gentlemen	friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	nice	people	and	more	or	less	radical	on	the	sex	question.	In	order	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">drown	her	pain	she	began	to	go	out	very	frequently	with	that	crowd,	and	to	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">surprise	 and	 delight	 she	 found	 that	 she	 soon	 began	 to	 think	 less	 and	 less	 about her	 contemptible	 seducer,	 and,	 what	 was	 more	 important	 to	 her,	 she	 was	 soon</p>
