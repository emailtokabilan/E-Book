<p class="calibre1">From	CHRONICLES	OF	THE	EARTH	EMPIRE	series. </p>
<p class="calibre1">CHOICES	by	Lindsay	Brambles</p>
<p class="calibre1">Introduction:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Although	the	events	of	the	following	story	take	place	after	the	novel	In	Darkness Bound	and	the	novella	Zero-Option,	this	story	was	actually	written	before	either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	time	I	was	slowly	constructing	my	“Earth	Empire”	universe;	and	though In	Darkness	Bound	(	ISBN:	1-4241-6560-1)	was	very	much	on	my	mind	at	the time,	the	idea	for	this	story	was	committed	to	paper	first.	Or	perhaps	it	would	be more	appropriate	to	say	“disk.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	with	Zero-Option,	I	wrote	this	on	a	Commodore	64	using	Paperclip	II.	The Commodore	was	the	first	“real”	computer	I	owned;	and	all	things	considered,	it was	a	marvelous	little	machine.	Before	that	I	had	cranked	out	stories	on	a	Smith-Corona	Electronic	typewriter	(including	one	humongous	novel,	which	for	some reason	I	still	hold	onto	despite	the	fact	that	it’s	an	unpublishable	monstrosity). </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	can’t	honestly	recall	the	motivations	that	led	to	the	writing	of	Choices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes	ideas	come	spring	from	events	you	read	in	the	newspaper	or	see	on TV.	Often	it’ll	be	some	little	thing	that	will	then	trigger	an	avalanche	of	thought and	speculation.	I	do	know	that	a	great	many	of	my	ideas	are	fleshed	out	while bicycling.	On	my	regular	two	or	three	hour	rides	I	do	some	of	my	best	thinking, working	out	the	kinks	in	a	story	or	novel	while	wandering	the	country	roads around	Ottawa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	have	yet	another	short	novel	of	the	Earth	Empire	(somewhat	longer	than	Zero-Option)	that	I	hope	to	put	on	the	Internet	at	a	later	date.	That	one	takes	place</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p3"></a>during	the	height	of	the	war,	sometime	after	Zero-Option	but	well	before Choices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	now,	however,	I	offer	you	the	following	short	story.	Just	under	twenty thousand	words,	I	hope	you’ll	find	it	a	quick	and	stimulating	read. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Happy	reading! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lindsay	H.F.	Brambles,	Ottawa,	2007</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p4"></a><b class="calibre3">1. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Whenever	I	see	the	panai,	I	am	reminded	of	Kieara.	Reminded	of	how	she changed	a	world.	Or	worlds—hers	and	mine.	I	close	my	eyes	and	see	her	face, and	above	the	chanting	of	the	crowd,	I	hear	her	voice.	A	soft	exhalation	of words.	Calm.	Measured	and	reasoned.	Not	at	all	consumed	with	the	impassioned zeal	that	one	might	have	expected	of	someone	rebelling	against	a	centuries	old way	of	life.	A	sharp	contrast	to	the	shrill	and	often	violent	denunciations	of	those who	believed	in	all	that	she	did	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	Kieara	I’d	never	seen	a	panai—though,	as	with	all	offworlders	new	to Tradur,	I	had	heard	the	rumors	long	before	I’d	arrived.	Had	heard	them,	and	of course	had	quickly	dismissed	them	as	nothing	more	than	xenophobia.	And	yet now,	because	of	Kieara,	those	rumors	have	become	a	dreaded	reality.	I	see	the evidence	of	them	before	me,	day	after	day,	hour	by	hour.	They	haunt	me, appearing	before	me	as	one	long	and	seemingly	endless	chain	of	enraged humanity	moving	up	the	wide	avenue	like	a	deranged	army,	swaying	to	a	music only	they	can	hear	as	they	wave	their	fists	in	the	air	and	shout	defiance	at	the guarded	buildings	of	the	offworlder	embassies.	Often,	from	the	windows	of	the Federation’s	mission,	I	have	stood	and	watched	as	they	pause	and	gather	outside the	gates,	pressing	against	one	another	in	a	suffocating	mass,	remaining	thus	just long	enough	to	hurl	their	vitriol	and	fling	their	ineffectual	stones	against	the energy	shields	that	protect	the	building	during	each	long	hour	of	Tradur’s	thirty hour	days.	It	has	become	a	ritual	for	them.	Almost	as	much	as	the	panai	has always	been.	And	for	those	of	us	within	the	embassy,	it	has	become	as	constant as	the	rising	and	the	setting	of	the	sun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wait	and	watch	in	discomfort,	knowing	that	I’m	at	least	partially	to	blame	for this.	Because	of	my	relationship	with	Kieara	I’ve	made	us	all	prisoners	in	these walls	until	the	ship	comes	to	take	us	away.	I	think	of	how	things	might	have been	if	Kieara	hadn’t	sought	me	out	those	many	months	ago,	of	how	different this	moment	would	be	if	the	first	real	choice	she’d	made	in	her	life	hadn’t	been to	choose	me.	Perhaps	there’d	be	no	chanting	crowds	thirsting	for	the	blood	of offworlders;	and	we’d	have	all	remained	blissfully	ignorant	of	the	true	horror	she dared	reveal	to	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p5"></a><b class="calibre3">2. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	all	stories,	this	one	has	a	beginning.	But	it	starts	at	the	end	of	another	story</p>
<p class="calibre1">—or	perhaps	at	the	end	of	many.	Its	beginnings	are	rooted	in	the	conclusion	of	a long	and	bitter	conflict	from	which	the	Empire	is	only	now	slowly	emerging.	If there	can	be	said	of	such	a	hard	fought	war	that	there	was	a	winner,	then	it	was the	Federation	that	rose	from	the	dust	and	rubble	to	claim	victory.	But	in	truth we’re	all	losers	in	such	struggles,	and	no	more	is	that	evident	than	in	the existence	of	worlds	like	Tradur. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	victory	was	bought	at	great	expense.	We	sacrificed	millions	of	men	and women	for	the	sake	of	principle,	but	in	the	end	we	sold	those	principles	for	a mess	of	potage.	Peace	came	with	compromise;	and	part	of	that	was	to	allow worlds	like	Tradur	to	remain	virtually	sovereign,	exempt	from	many	of	the provisions	of	the	new	constitution.	It	isn’t	something	most	people	like,	but	after so	much	death	and	destruction	no	one	wanted	to	continue	the	war	simply	for	the rights	and	freedoms	of	a	handful	of	people.	Principles	were	what	got	us	into	this mess	in	the	first	place;	and	when	all	is	said	and	done,	just	how	many	lives	are worth	sacrificing	for	the	sake	of	ideals	that	many	of	the	people	on	Tradur	and worlds	like	it	could	care	less	about? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	say	that	when	we	won	the	war	against	the	Reds	we	should	have	wiped	the religion	off	the	face	of	the	map.	They	argue	that	to	have	not	done	so	is	only asking	for	trouble	later	on;	and	it’s	true	there	are	those	among	the	Red	Catholic polity	who	continue	to	agitate	for	rebellion.	But	even	they	realize	the	limitations of	their	cause,	and	understand	that	among	their	own	there	is	no	longer	an appetite	for	war.	Whole	worlds	were	lost	in	the	conflict.	Hundreds	of	millions	of people.	No	one	is	anxious	to	invite	that	upon	the	Empire	again	any	time	soon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	so	we	live	with	conditions	many	of	us	find	repugnant.	We	have	no	choice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	is	neither	the	strength	nor	the	will	within	the	Federation	to	carry	the	fight beyond	what	we’ve	achieved.	One	day	we	may	well	live	to	regret	that,	but	for now	we’re	happy	enough	to	live	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	seen	the	war	first	hand,	having	fought	on	the	front	lines	during	some	of	the worst	of	the	conflict.	I	had	watched	many	good	people	die.	A	lot	of	friends.	A	lot of	people	dear	to	me.	I	should	have	hated	the	Reds	for	that,	and	there	was	a	part of	me	that	did.	But	having	been	witness	to	the	war	in	ways	many	had	not,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p6"></a>understood	better	than	most	that	we	could	never	rid	ourselves	of	the	Reds.	It’s	a difficult	thing	to	fight	ideas.	More	difficult	still	when	those	ideas	take	the	form of	religion	and	faith.	Guns	and	bombs	are	ineffective	against	them.	And	to	have tried	to	have	done	more	than	what	we	had,	we	would	have	had	to	have	paid	even more	dearly	than	we	already	had.	I	didn’t	want	to	see	any	more	graves,	and	most everyone	else	in	Fleet	felt	the	same.	We’d	had	our	fill	of	funerals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	early	days	following	the	war,	Admiralty	controlled	the	Federation.	As	I still	held	my	commission,	the	powers-at-be	decided	that	for	the	difficult	posting of	ambassador	to	Tradur	they	would	prefer	a	person	with	a	strong	military background.	I	had	captained	the	heavy	cruiser	FS	Indomitable,	and	had	been fleet	captain	when	Chastity	had	fallen	to	Fleet	warships.	But	my	face	was unknown	to	the	Reds,	which	meant	I	could	go	into	Tradur	in	the	guise	of	a civilian. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Technically,	as	the	Federation’s	ambassador,	I	was	the	most	powerful	person	on the	planet.	But	in	reality	the	Federation’s	control	over	Tradur	basically	stopped	a few	hundred	kilometres	from	the	surface.	The	Reds	still	maintained	an	iron	grip on	the	population,	and	to	have	replaced	them	with	the	sort	of	democratic government	the	Federation	preferred	would	have	been	near	to	impossible	given the	unswerving	allegiance	many	on	the	world	had	to	the	Red	Catholic	faith. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	arrived	I	understood	this	pressure	cooker	I	was	stepping	into,	and	the risk	my	background	in	the	military	posed.	On	Tradur	there	was	still	a	lot	of enmity	for	Fleet,	who	many	regarded	as	their	oppressor	and	enemy	of	the	faith. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	would	never	have	knowingly	countenanced	the	presence	of	a	Fleet	officer</p>
<p class="calibre1">—active	or	retired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Accordingly.	I	made	every	effort	to	play	the	part	of	diplomat—even	to	the	point of	hosting	a	reception	not	long	after	I	arrived.	It	was	here	that	I	first	met	Kieara; and	it	is	a	moment	I	shall	never	forget.	It	changed	my	life	forever—and	may well	have	changed	the	future	of	entire	worlds. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a><b class="calibre3">3. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Probably	the	most	powerful	man	on	the	planet,”	Burrye	muttered	to	me	in warning	as	a	tall,	elegantly-attired	Tradurian	approached	us	through	the assembled	guests.	He	was	like	a	great	ship	whose	prow	cut	the	waves	with impunity,	the	crowd	parting	before	him	without	urging,	while	in	his	wake	trailed an	even	dozen	of	his	entourage,	who,	like	gulls	hovering	above	the	transom	of	a yacht	in	hopes	of	food,	waited	to	dart	forward	upon	a	summons.	At	the	great man’s	side	a	young	woman—surely	too	young	to	be	one	of	his	many	wives—</p>
<p class="calibre1">matched	his	pace	without	seeming	effort,	floating	gracefully	along	in	a	billowing cloud	of	silver-blue	silks.	She	was	tall	and	slender	and	strikingly	beautiful;	and	I wondered	if	the	crowd	parted	as	much	for	her	as	they	did	for	the	man	whom	she accompanied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	makes	you	wonder	if	we	actually	won	the	war,”	Burrye	said	in	a	surly undertone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	would	have	been	a	mistake	to	have	completely	crushed	the	Church,”	I	said around	a	tight	smile.	“And	on	worlds	like	this	they’re	still	the	dominant	power.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like	I	said,”	Burrye	growled:	“It	makes	you	wonder	who	won	the	damn	war.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Prelate	Kuhn,”	I	said,	bowing	deferentially	as	the	head	of	the	Tradurian	Red Catholic	Church	halted	before	us	and	surveyed	us	with	an	imperious	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our	host,	Tiae	Morrisohn,”	said	one	of	the	courtiers	in	response	to	Kuhn’s questioning	look	over	his	shoulder.	“The	new	Federation	ambassador	from Earth,	assari.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Earth,”	said	Kuhn,	venting	the	word	from	his	mouth	as	though	it	were	an imprecation.	“You	are	a	long	way	from	home,	ambassador,”	he	added,	with	a lowering	glare	of	openly	hostile	contempt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	difficult	to	know	what	to	say	in	response	to	the	obvious.	But	as	I	regarded the	prelate	and	his	companion,	I	realized	he	wasn’t	talking	about	light-years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed,	the	great	gulf	between	our	two	worlds	became	markedly	evident	as	we stood	there	facing	one	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>“The	people	of	Earth	wish	you	long	life	and	prosperity,	assari,”	I	said,	filling	the sudden	and	uncomfortable	silence	with	this	stilted	bit	of	protocol	I’d	been instructed	to	follow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	do	not	need,	nor	do	I	desire	the	good	wishes	of	your	world,”	snarled	the prelate.	“It	may	well	be	the	belief	of	the	Federation	that	you	have	won	a	great victory	and	that	you	have	somehow	unified	the	Earth	Empire,	ambassador.	But	I can	assure	you	that	is	not	a	sentiment	shared	by	my	people.	We	tolerate	your presence	here	because	the	Terms	of	Surrender	provide	us	no	alternative.	But beyond	honoring	the	agreement	signed	by	the	cardinali,	we	are	not	obligated	to embrace	you	and	your	heathen	ways.	We	do	not	wish	to	be	contaminated	by	the incursion	of	outside	forces.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	isn’t	our	intention	to	threaten	the	integrity	of	your	world	in	any	way,	assari,”	I assured	him,	although	that	was	stretching	the	truth	somewhat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	very	presence	here	threatens	it,”	he	said;	and	then	he	was	gone,	drifting away	in	his	cloud	of	obsequious	followers,	targeting	yet	another	of	the	offworld ambassadors	as	an	audience	for	his	litany	of	condemnation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	were	lucky,”	said	Burrye	dryly.	“He’s	not	usually	so	pleasant.”	He	had	a glass	of	something	potent	in	hand,	and	took	a	sip	from	it	as	his	narrowed	eyes followed	the	progress	of	the	prelate	through	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	met	worse.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shook	his	head,	sober-faced.	“No,	Captain,	I	very	much	doubt	you	have.	This is	no	ordinary	man;	and	his	feelings	about	offworlders	are	widely	known.	They carry	considerable	weight—even	if	the	Church	is	no	longer	the	force	it	once	was in	the	Empire.	When	you’ve	been	here	a	bit	longer	you’ll	realize	that	while Tradur	may	outwardly	appear	to	be	a	paradise,	it’s	anything	but.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	make	it	seem	so	ominous,”	I	teased. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Burrye	didn’t	laugh.	“I	think	it	is,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Surely	you	don’t	put	much	stock	in	rumor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	only	been	here	a	couple	of	days,”	he	grunted	as	he	took	yet	another draw	from	his	drink.	“You	haven’t	seen	much	beyond	the	embassy	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>shuttle	port.	Wait	a	few	weeks.	The	allure	of	the	scenery	soon	fades,	I	assure you.	It	won’t	be	long	before	you’ll	realize	there’s	something	not	quite	right	about this	place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	you’re	making	the	mistake	of	looking	at	it	through	the	eyes	of	an offworlder,”	I	suggested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	the	only	eyes	I	have,	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	can’t	judge	them	as	we	would	judge	ourselves,”	I	cautioned	him.	“They’re tens	of	light-years	and	a	dozen	or	so	centuries	removed	from	Earth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Clearly,”	Burrye	muttered,	with	a	distaste	I	found	disquieting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	me,”	I	said,	wanting	to	change	the	subject,	“who	was	the	woman	with	the Kuhn?”	I	tried	to	sound	casual	in	my	inquiry,	but	was	only	partially	successful.	I could	tell	by	the	cautionary	look	Burrye	gave	me	that	he	wasn’t	in	the	least	bit fooled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kieara	Cjhar,”	he	said,	following	my	gaze	as	I	watched	her	move	with	Kuhn from	one	offworld	delegation	to	another.	“One	of	his	daughters.	The	eldest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’s	a	leading	disciple	within	the	Red	Catholic	Church.	Like	father	like daughter,	I	suppose.”	He	made	a	face.	“Not	someone	you’d	want	to	get	involved with,”	he	added	pointedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	speak	from	experience?”	I	asked,	knowing	that	he	didn’t.	At	the	official level	relations	between	Tradurians	and	offworlders	were	severely	constrained—</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	might	even	have	gone	so	far	as	to	suggest	they	were	virtually	non-existent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	for	lack	of	effort	on	the	part	of	offworlders,	however;	it	was	the	choice	of the	Tradurians	to	remain	essentially	isolated.	Even	on	matters	of	trade	the dealings	were	brief	and	to	the	point.	Not	that	we’d	anticipated	much	else	when we’d	begun	this	delicate	process	of	bringing	the	worlds	of	Unity	back	into	the fold	of	the	Federation	following	the	long	harsh	decades	of	war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Burrye	regarded	me	levelly.	“I’m	here	to	advise	you,	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Advise,	yes,”	agreed.	“But	I	make	the	decisions,	Mister	Burrye.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	not	on	a	ship	anymore,”	he	said	bluntly.	“There’s	none	of	that	full	speed ahead	and	damn	the	torpedoes	business	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>“Thank	you	for	reminding	me,”	I	drawled,	none	too	sarcastically.	“And	yes,	I’m not	on	a	ship	anymore.	Haven’t	been	for	years.	So	you	might	be	advised	to	be cautious	when	referring	to	me	as	Captain.	I’m	sure	the	Reds	wouldn’t	be particularly	enamored	of	the	fact	that	the	Federation	embassy	is	headed	by someone	who	once	fought	on	the	front	lines	against	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,aye!”	he	said,	snapping	off	a	mock	salute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shot	him	a	dark	look	of	disapproval,	but	knew	it	wouldn’t	change	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Burrye	was	a	career	diplomat,	a	man	genengineered	for	the	foreign	service.	He knew	no	other	line	of	work;	and	his	life	had	been	devoted	to	this	one	cause.	So	it was	understandable	that	he	might	feel	somewhat	resentful	of	a	spacer	being given	an	essentially	diplomatic	assignment.	He	was	undoubtedly	convinced	I’d been	awarded	this	posting	as	something	of	a	sop	for	years	of	service	in	a	war	for which	we’d	all	paid	a	high	price.	It	was	unlikely	I	could	disabuse	him	of	that notion—though	if	he’d	looked	around,	he’d	have	discovered	that	most	of	the ambassadorial	positions	that	had	opened	up	in	the	defeated	Unity	were	occupied by	former	Fleet	officers.	And	for	good	reason.	The	Federation	didn’t	trust	the Unity—or	what	remained	of	it.	Unfortunately,	one	of	the	compromises	that	had brought	about	the	peace	had	been	to	include	a	clause	in	the	Terms	of	Surrender that	had	prohibited	the	placement	of	military	attaches	in	any	of	the	new embassies.	To	get	around	that,	the	Admiralty,	which	was	handling	the administration	of	peace	for	the	Federation,	had	merely	assigned	former	Fleet officers	as	heads	of	the	various	missions	they’d	opened	throughout	the	Unity.	We were	here	to	make	sure	that	the	Unity	couldn’t	re-establish	itself	militarily.	So for	now	men	and	women	like	myself	had	assumed	a	different	sort	of	command: One	that	was	no	less	challenging	and	no	less	important	than	when	we’d skippered	those	floating	arsenals	of	democracy	for	which	Fleet	was	better known. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	was	first	and	foremost	a	spacer.	I’d	been	genengineered	for	it.	From	the moment	of	my	conception	my	fate	had	been	determined.	Determined	by	the choices	of	my	parents.	I	wasn’t	a	diplomat,	and	Burrye	knew	it.	As	far	as	he	was concerned,	that	meant	I	was	a	risk	to	the	success	of	this	mission.	Maybe	he	was right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	offense,”	Burrye	said,	continuing	in	his	earlier	vein,	“but	it’s	a	bit	of	a stretch	from	commanding	a	warship	to	heading	a	mission	like	this,	don’t	you think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>“Not	at	all,”	I	assured	him.	“Being	the	captain	of	a	ship	can	be	the	supreme	test of	diplomacy.	When	you’re	dealing	with	the	lives	of	nearly	a	thousand	men	and women,	not	to	mention	the	frequent	confrontations	with	all	manner	of	ships	and worlds,	you	soon	acquire	quite	a	feel	for	this	sort	of	thing.	However,	I	trust	that you’ll	keep	me	in	line,	should	I	make	a	misstep.”	I	looked	at	him	forcefully, making	it	clear	that	he	had	better	work	with	me	and	not	against	me.	If	it	were	the latter,	then	he’d	soon	find	himself	catching	the	next	ship	out	from	Tradur.	Not that	I	was	sure	he’d	mind	being	chased	from	this	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Burrye	put	down	his	drink	and	made	a	stiff	bow.	Then	he	straightened,	as	though coming	to	attention.	“You	can	rest	assured,	Captain,	that	I’ll	serve	to	the	best	of my	abilities.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	what	I	was	afraid	of. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a><b class="calibre3">4. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">If	you	imagine	a	tropical	paradise	on	Earth,	then	you	have	a	good	impression	of what	an	outsider	sees	upon	arriving	at	the	central	shuttle	port	on	Tradur.	It’s perhaps	one	of	the	most	beautiful	worlds	in	all	the	Earth	Empire.	Certainly among	the	prettiest	I’ve	ever	had	the	good	fortune	to	see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	space	one	is	immediately	struck	by	the	lack	of	continents.	There	are	only islands	girding	the	equator,	strung	like	a	necklace	through	azure	seas.	Few	reach farther	north	or	south	than	twenty	degrees	latitude;	and	given	that	the	axial	tilt	of the	world	is	little	more	than	five	degrees,	this	makes	for	what	some	call	a monoclimatic	situation—although	in	truth	that	is	a	condition	supportable	in	only the	most	rigid	of	closed	systems. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	surface	Tradur	is	every	bit	as	beautiful	as	it	is	from	space.	Perhaps	even more	so.	But	that’s	the	physical	side	of	the	world.	Not	the	political	one.	And	on the	latter	score	Tradur	isn’t	so	pleasant.	Indeed,	as	Burrye	had	warned	me,	it’s easy	to	dismiss	the	scenery	once	one	has	become	more	accustomed	to	what	day-to-day	life	is	like	on	this	planet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	is	an	air	of	guarded	restraint	whenever	one	has	dealings	with	the	locals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	in	the	markets	this	is	apparent,	though	the	merchants	are	eager	enough	to part	you	from	your	coin.	But	they	do	so	rather	circumspectly,	as	though	they’re under	the	ever-watchful	eye	of	the	Church	and	its	minions—which	is	more	than likely	true. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everywhere	you	go	you	have	the	feeling	of	being	under	surveillance.	For	myself that	isn’t	an	altogether	new	experience.	Before	they	gave	me	a	ship	to	command, I	spent	several	years	in	Naval	Intelligence.	As	a	field	operative	you	learn	quickly to	be	paranoid—it	can	sometimes	mean	the	difference	between	life	and	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	ambassador	to	Tradur	I	was	reminded	of	those	days.	No	doubt	it	was	partly because	of	those	NI	experiences	that	I	ended	up	here.	And	it	was	perhaps	also because	of	those	experiences	that	I	was	wary	when	Kieara	Cjhar	first	approached me. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a><b class="calibre3">5. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	shouldn’t	go,”	said	Burrye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	him	squarely.	“Are	there	valid	reasons	for	this	concern?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only	the	obvious,	like	the	fact	they	might	try	to	kill	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ve	had	ample	opportunity	for	that	already.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	would	be	quite	easy	for	them	to	arrange	compromising	circumstances	that could	prove	an	embarrassment	to	the	Federation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	risk	we’ll	have	to	take,”	I	said,	smiling	thinly.	“We	can	hardly	be	effective	in our	mission	if	we	allow	ourselves	to	be	governed	by	that	particular	fear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	whole	cloak	and	dagger	business	is	sheer	nonsense!”	he	exclaimed.	“What possible	reason	could	the	daughter	of	the	prelate	have	for	wanting	to	see	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	suppose	I’ll	find	out	soon	enough.	Perhaps	she	took	a	liking	to	me,”	I	added, only	half	facetiously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Burrye	gave	me	an	odd	look.	“I’m	sure	you’re	not	serious,”	he	said	in	an	even tone.	“The	Church	is	still	the	power	here,	Captain.	And	Kieara	Cjhar	is	very much	a	part	of	it.	On	any	other	world	such	a	relationship	would	probably	cause few	problems.	But	not	here.	If	she	did	take	a	fancy	to	you,	she’d	never	dare breathe	a	word	of	it.	Not	to	you	or	anyone.	Certainly	she’d	never	dare	act	upon	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">—even	if	she	is	the	daughter	of	the	prelate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	a	fool,”	I	said,	rather	icy-toned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	muttered	something	under	his	breath	and	shook	his	head.	Then	he	said	more loudly,	“It’s	a	fool’s	errand,	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	see	no	threat,”	I	argued.	“And	I	can	hardly	refuse	the	invitation.	The	purpose of	our	mission	is	to	improve	diplomatic	relations,	not	hinder	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	might	yet	do	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>It	would	have	been	easy	to	have	laughed	off	his	reservations,	but	they	were	quite convincing	ones.	Indeed,	when	the	request	for	a	meeting	between	me	and	Kieara Cjhar	had	come	through,	I’d	confronted	myself	with	the	very	same	concerns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tradur,	after	all,	wasn’t	like	most	of	the	worlds	that	had	been	a	part	of	Unity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Few	of	those	had	begun	as	enclaves	of	the	Church,	and	consequently	their populations	hadn’t	been	almost	exclusively	composed	of	devoted	practitioners	of the	faith.	When	the	Unity	had	fallen,	many	had	welcomed	the	end	of	Church tyranny	elsewhere	in	the	Empire.	Here,	however,	nearly	the	entire	population was	of	a	fundamentalist	bent;	and	though	the	Unity	had	been	defeated	here	as elsewhere,	the	people	of	this	world	hadn’t	faltered	in	their	beliefs.	If	anything, they’d	become	more	devout	in	their	adherence	to	the	strictures	of	the	Red Catholic	Church.	And	despite	the	Federation’s	best	efforts	to	temper	the influence	of	the	Church,	its	presence	remained	a	powerful,	overarching	force. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	why	a	handful	of	priests	and	cardinali	could	continue	to	exert	control over	the	people	through	the	use	of	fear.	Those	who	might	try	to	turn	their	backs on	the	guardians	of	the	faith	did	so	at	peril.	The	price	they	could	pay	for	such audacity	was	dear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Burrye	was	right	in	wondering	just	who	had	won	the	war.	In	the	twentieth century,	when	Hilter’s	forces	had	fallen	to	the	Allies,	the	Nazis	had	been	crushed and	virtually	wiped	from	the	face	of	the	Earth.	But	when	the	Federation	had finally	prevailed	in	its	long	struggle	against	the	Unity,	Red	Catholicism	and	all its	many	institutions	had	remained.	Yet	this	was	a	religion	responsible	for	the deaths	of	millions	in	the	years	since	its	fiery	birth.	In	the	name	of	the	Red Catholic	Popes	who	had	reigned	through	the	decades	of	conflict,	tens	of thousands	of	Empaths	had	been	hunted	down	and	slaughtered.	Butchered	like animals.	And	in	its	quest	to	broaden	the	compass	of	its	reach,	whole	worlds	had been	razed	to	eliminate	them	as	a	threat	to	the	faith. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	should	at	least	take	someone	with	you,”	Burrye	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	gave	him	a	dry	look.	“That	would	hardly	help	foster	trust,	now	would	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With	all	due	respect,	Captain,	I	don’t	think	the	Reds	are	deserving	of	anyone’s trust.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	puzzle	me,	Jacob,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	frowned. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>“You	act	like	someone	with	a	grudge,”	I	explained.	“I’ve	seen	Empaths	with	less animosity	towards	the	Unity	than	you	seem	to	harbor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Burrye’s	face	coloured.	“I	just	wonder	why	we’re	so	magnanimous,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	killed	millions.	You	of	all	people	should	know	the	brutality	they exhibited.	You	were	there,	on	the	front	lines.	You	saw	people	die.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	I	whispered.	“I	saw	people	die.	Too	many.	Which	is	why	I’m	here.	I’ve no	desire	to	see	more	people	join	those	who	have	already	suffered	our	folly.	I want	to	see	this	peace	work,	Jacob.	And	if	that	means	showing	a	little	humility when	it	comes	to	the	Red	Catholics,	if	it	means	accepting	that	they’ll	continue	to be	a	part	of	this	Empire,	then	so	be	it.	That’s	infinitely	preferable	to	war.	Only someone	who	has	never	fought	in	one	could	think	otherwise,”	I	added	pointedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps,	Captain,	you’ve	become	too	hardened	by	your	years	of	service.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	arched	a	brow	and	regarded	him	quizzically.	“Meaning?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Meaning	that	perhaps	you	can	no	longer	understand	the	pain	of	those	of	us	who lost	loved	ones	because	of	the	Reds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	felt	a	small	kernel	of	rage	explode	somewhere	within	me,	but	I	didn’t	unleash it.	What	would	have	been	gained	by	railing	at	him?	How	could	he	know	his words	were	like	a	stinging	slap	across	the	face?	Unless,	of	course,	he’d	intended them	to	be	just	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	in	the	ships	weren’t	machines	out	there,”	I	said	in	a	slow,	deliberate	manner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	wasn’t	easy	killing	people.	It	never	is.	And	despite	what	some	might	suggest, you	don’t	become	hardened	to	it.	The	only	way	one	ever	kept	one’s	sanity	was	to tell	oneself	that	it	was	us	or	them.	And	better	it	be	them	than	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Burrye	shifted	uncomfortably.	“I	didn’t	mean	to	imply—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	I	know	what	you	meant,”	I	said	brusquely.	“And	now	if	you’ll	excuse me,	I’ve	a	meeting	to	attend.”	I	made	to	leave	my	office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain,”	Burrye	called	after	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	and	looked	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>He	stared	back	at	me,	looking	somewhat	contrite.	“Good	luck,”	he	said	at	last. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Luck	is	for	the	unprepared,”	I	said,	remembering	an	old	adage	from	my	days	in the	Academy.	And	then	I	left,	hurrying	out	of	the	embassy	on	my	way	to	my appointment	with	Kieara	Cjhar—where	I	soon	discovered	I	should	have	paid heed	to	another	little	tidbit	of	Academy	advice:	expect	the	unexpected. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a><b class="calibre3">6. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Put	this	on,”	my	guide	said.	He	handed	me	a	black,	hooded	cloak.	“For	the scanners,”	he	explained,	noting	my	perplexed	look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	have	thought	that	it	would	have	taken	something	a	little	more	sophisticated than	this,”	I	mused	aloud	as	I	donned	the	garment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	laughed.	“They	are	more	pious	on	Tradur	than	they	are	on	Chastity,”	he	said in	a	lumbering	baritone.	“It	has	always	allowed	the	Church	to	rule	by	fear.	Little need	for	expensive	security	devices	when	you	can	achieve	the	same	thing	by threatening	would-be	transgressors	with	the	wrath	of	God.”	He	laughed	again,	a brittle,	cynical	laughter;	and	then	he	pulled	the	hood	of	his	own	cloak	up	over	his head,	burying	his	face	in	shadow.	He	started	forward,	motioning	for	me	to follow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	stepped	from	the	safety	of	the	embassy’s	encompassing	shield	and	out	onto the	ill-lit	avenue	we’d	all	taken	to	calling	“Embassy	Row.”	There	was	no	one	in sight,	which	was	the	whole	idea.	Without	checking	to	see	whether	or	not	I	was following,	the	guide	headed	quickly	up	the	avenue,	towards	the	heart	of	the	city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	no	stranger	to	the	machinations	of	the	underground,	but	the	method	by which	I	was	conveyed	to	my	rendezvous	with	Kieara	Cjhar	rivaled	anything	I’d ever	experienced	as	an	intelligence	operative.	We	moved	under	cover	of darkness,	my	guide	and	I	wending	our	way	through	the	narrow	streets	of Tradur’s	capital,	Jehku,	avoiding	the	more	built-up	areas	of	the	city.	Once	we even	descended	into	the	murky	depths	of	a	maze	of	service	tunnels,	far	from	the prying	eyes	of	the	curatai,	the	morality	police	who	patrolled	the	streets	in	search of	strictures	violators.	The	curatai	made	me	mindful	of	the	fact	that	there	was	a curfew	in	effect	for	Tradurian	woman	following	the	setting	of	the	sun.	This lasted	until	sunrise,	at	which	point	the	women	of	Tradur	exchanged	the	prison	of their	home	for	the	prison	of	a	society	that	saw	them	as	little	more	than	property. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	moved	through	the	oppressive	heat	of	the	tropical	night,	I	was	ever mindful	of	Burrye’s	fears.	It	would	be	easy	for	me	to	disappear	in	a	situation	like this.	Or	worse,	perhaps,	to	be	caught	by	the	curatai	doing	what	I	shouldn’t	have been	doing	in	the	first	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>My	fears	were	quelled	somewhat	when	we	reached	what	my	guide	claimed	was our	destination.	I	recognized	it	immediately	as	the	Temple	of	Sentai,	which, according	to	my	research	earlier	in	the	day,	was	the	known	residence	of	Kieara Cjhar.	I	was	ushered	in	through	a	narrow	doorway	that	was	far	from	the	main entrance	of	the	temple.	My	guide	remained	outside.	Once	within,	I	found	myself alone,	standing	in	my	dark	cape	in	the	center	of	a	small	antechamber.	I	drew back	my	hood	and	looked	around,	but	there	was	little	to	see.	The	room	was poorly	lit	by	a	single	glowtube.	There	were	no	markings	on	the	walls,	and	no openings,	save	the	door	through	which	I’d	come	and	another	opposite	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	waited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	when	I	had	begun	to	think	I’d	been	played	the	fool,	a	woman	appeared	at the	other	door.	She	beckoned	in	silence,	gesturing	me	forth,	deeper	into	the temple.	Sentai	was	restricted	to	women.	More	particularly,	to	those	women	who had	devoted	their	lives	to	the	Church.	They	were	known	as	the	cjhavari,	the daughters	of	the	god-revered.	No	Tradurian	male—including	the	prelate	himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">—was	permitted	within	the	walls	of	the	temple.	To	violate	this	sanction	was	to risk	certain	censure	from	the	Church—the	least	of	which	was	excommunication, though	punishments	as	severe	as	death	weren’t	unheard	of. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	nothing	impressive	about	the	interior	of	the	temple.	It	lacked	the ornateness	that	was	to	be	found	in	the	palace	of	the	cardinali	and	the	cathedral	of the	prelate,	or	in	any	of	the	many	churches	that	dominated	much	of	the	skyline of	Jehku	and	the	other	cities	of	Tradur.	Indeed,	its	simple	appointments	were	a rather	refreshing	contrast	to	a	faith	that	seemed	mired	in	the	cynicism	of	gaudy gold	and	jewel	encrusted	trappings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	walked	down	several	passageways,	all	of	which	were	dimly	lit	by	scattered glowtubes.	There	were	doors	set	here	and	there	in	the	thick	walls,	all	of	them closed,	most	of	them	no	doubt	concealing	the	spartan	cells	in	which	I	imagined the	occupants	of	the	Sentai	lived.	At	length	the	young	acolyte	who	had	been leading	me	through	this	labyrinth	halted	before	one	of	these	doors.	She	turned	to me	and	bowed,	lifted	a	hand	indicatively	towards	the	door,	and	then	backed away,	finally	retreating	down	the	corridor	and	leaving	me	to	stand	there bewildered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	moment	or	two	I	did	the	instinctual	thing	and	knocked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>“Come	in,	Ambassador	Morrisohn.	The	door	is	not	locked.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pushed,	and	the	door,	made	of	heavy	wood	and	bound	with	iron,	swung inwards	on	well-oiled	hinges,	opening	to	reveal	a	room	quite	like	what	I’d expected	to	find.	It	was	spare,	with	a	narrow	cot	in	one	corner,	a	desk	placed before	a	window,	and	a	tall	clothes	cupboard	on	the	wall	opposite	the	bed.	There were	a	couple	of	chairs,	one	for	the	desk	and	one	clearly	for	a	guest—the	latter looking	somewhat	out	of	place	and	no	doubt	there	solely	for	my	benefit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kieara	Cjhar	sat	by	the	desk.	She	wore	a	simple	white	linen	shift,	quite	unlike the	stunning	gown	she’d	worn	to	the	embassy	reception.	Oddly	enough,	she seemed	more	fetching	in	this	coarse	garment,	the	simplicity	of	its	design	and material	a	marked	understatement	that	permitted	her	natural	beauty	to	radiate unblemished.	She	wore	no	jewellery,	and	her	dark,	lustrous	hair	was	bound	in	a single	braid	that	hung	down	her	back	and	reached	to	her	waist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled	warmly,	invitingly,	and	gestured	towards	the	other	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat,	easing	myself	into	the	seat,	eyeing	my	host	somewhat	warily.	For	a moment	we	merely	sat	staring	at	one	another.	Or	perhaps	it	was	I	who	just	stared at	her,	for	I	couldn’t	get	over	how	beautiful	she	was.	Beautiful,	because	her features	weren’t	the	stony,	unrealistic	perfection	of	the	bioscultor.	There	were flaws	and	imperfections,	which	only	seemed	to	make	the	face	all	that	much	more attractive.	It	had	a	character	that	so	many	sculpted	ones	like	my	own	didn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	first	thing	she	said	was:	“Foreigners	are	forbidden	within	the	walls	of	the Sentai.”	And	then	she	laughed,	clearly	amused	by	the	way	my	face	seemed	to lose	all	color. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	not	fret,	Captain	Morrisohn,”	Kieara	went	on.	“I	have	taken	precautions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Believe	me,	I	have	no	desire	to	draw	the	wrath	of	my	father.	He	would,	in	all	his piety,	find	it	necessary	to	make	an	example	of	me	before	the	whole	world.	That is	an	experience	the	like	of	which	I	can	guarantee	no	one	would	wish	to	endure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	called	me	Captain,”	I	said,	trying	to	ignore	the	sick	feeling	of	apprehension that	continued	to	gnaw	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	are	not	without	our	sources,	Captain.”	She	smiled	again,	a	smile	that illuminated	the	entire	room.	“The	Federation	may	well	have	won	the	war,	but	it has	not	rendered	the	Church	entirely	toothless.	There	are	still	many	devoted</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>followers	of	the	faith	throughout	the	Earth	Empire.	And	not	just	in	what	was once	known	as	the	Unity,”	she	added	pointedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	“Of	course,”	I	conceded.	She	was	merely	confirming	something Admiralty	had	long	known.	But	to	hear	it	from	someone	so	well	connected	to	the Church	gave	it	a	level	of	authenticity	it	had	never	quite	held	in	my	mind	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	are	wondering	why	you	are	here,”	said	Kieara. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Curious,	yes,”	I	agreed.	“You	seem	to	have	gone	to	a	great	deal	of	effort	to arrange	this	encounter	and	ensure	its	privacy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	amazing	the	things	people	will	do	for	you	when	you	are	the	daughter	of	the prelate,	captain,”	she	observed	somewhat	ruefully.	“On	this	world	people	are governed	much	by	their	fears.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Indeed.”	I	regarded	her	directly.	“And	are	you,	too,	governed	by	fear?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled	wanly.	“I	am	the	daughter	of	a	man	who	believes	himself	the	vessel of	God,	Captain.	He	lives	by	a	code,	a	set	of	standards	by	which	we	are	all expected	to	set	the	course	of	our	lives.	He	imagines	himself	the	last	bastion	of the	true	faith.	Chastity	may	well	have	been	the	center	of	the	Red	Catholic universe,	but	to	my	father	it	was	always	Tradur	which	paid	greatest	obeisance	to the	strictures	of	the	faith.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you’re	your	father’s	daughter,”	I	said	simply;	but	it	was	apparent	by	the fact	that	I	was	here,	in	a	place	that	I	shouldn’t	have	been,	that	she	wasn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	many	years	I	believed	as	he	did,”	she	conceded.	She	looked	down	at	her hands,	which	she	held	together	delicately	in	her	lap,	then	raised	her	eyes	to confront	me	once	more	with	that	bewitching	liquid	blue	stare.	“I	had	no	reason not	to.	I	was	born	and	raised	within	the	faith.	It	was	the	rule	by	which	my	life was	measured.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	were	no	offworlders	on	Tradur	until	the	defeat	of	the	Unity,”	she	said,	as though	that	were	explanation	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	waited	a	moment	before	saying	anything,	then:	“You	saw	a	different	way	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	saw	that	the	words	of	the	faith	had	not	run	true.	You	were	not	the	incarnations of	all	evil	our	leaders	to	us	you	were.	The	universe	did	not	open	up	a	great darkness	and	swallow	us	all	for	having	looked	upon	your	face.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whew!	Glad	to	know	that,”	I	said,	miming	relief	by	wiping	away	imaginary sweat	from	my	brow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	mock	me,”	she	said,	looking	hurt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sobered	quickly,	straightening	up	in	my	chair,	and	suddenly	feeling	apologetic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,”	I	said,	suitably	contrite.	“I	didn’t	mean	to	make	light	of	what	you’re saying.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	suppose	we	must	seem	rather	primitive	to	you,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Different.”	I	thought	of	the	war,	and	of	how	they’d	almost	won	it.	No,	they were	hardly	primitive,	although	Tradur	might	well	have	given	one	that impression.	But	then,	Tradur	wasn’t	like	any	of	the	other	worlds	of	what	had once	been	the	Unity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	world	has	changed	little	since	the	first	settlers	arrived,”	Kieara	continued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	has	always	been	a	reluctance	to	embrace	the	new.	And	in	the	tenets	of our	faith	we	have	strayed	little	from	the	original	doctrines,	save	where	it	has been	deemed	necessary	for	survival.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	must	come	at	a	cost.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	far	greater	one	than	you	can	imagine,	Captain,”	she	said,	her	manner	grave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	father	seeks	only	that	which	will	ensure	the	survival	of	his	faith.	He	will	do whatever	is	necessary	in	his	eyes	to	maintain	it,”	she	added.	“When	you	are blinded	by	the	unyielding	light	of	a	personal	vision,	Captain,	it	becomes	a	simple matter	to	find	justification	in	any	act.	The	leaders	of	our	faith	have	done	this	for centuries,	and	many	of	us	have	paid	a	dear	price	because	of	it.	The	war	with	the Federation	was	but	a	small	part	of	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“These	are	rather	frank	observations,	coming	from	one	who	is	said	to	be	so devoted	to	the	Church,”	I	pointed	out,	somewhat	cynically. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>“Do	not	be	deceived	by	all	you	see	and	here,	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	what	is	it	I’m	seeing	and	hearing	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	with	us	all,	you	will	see	and	hear	what	you	wish	to.”	Kieara	smiled	weakly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	would	show	you	honesty,	Captain.”	She	bowed	her	head	demurely.	“And	I would	hope	that	you	would	hear	sincerity.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	that	I	might	gain	your	trust.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	having	done	so?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	I	would	ask	of	you	a	favor,	and	hope	that	you	would	not	hesitate	in granting	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	swallowed,	feeling	a	leaden	lump	slide	down	my	throat	and	fall	heavily	into	the pit	of	my	stomach.	It	sat	there,	a	rotting	mass	of	anguish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	favor	will	you	ask?”	I	heard	myself	whisper	in	a	voice	tight	with	anxiety. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	now,	Captain,”	she	said.	“The	asking	will	come	when	I	am	sure	of	your reply.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	until	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	shall	meet,	as	we	have	met	now.	Again.	And	again.	However	many	times	it may	be	necessary.	Or	until	I	have	no	more	time,”	she	concluded	cryptically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	her	and	saw	a	sense	of	desperation	in	her	eyes:	a	plea	for understanding	and	patience.	And	I	thought	to	myself,	then,	that	if	she’d	asked me	her	favor	I	wouldn’t	have	hesitated	in	granting	it—even	if	it	had	meant risking	a	career. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	started	to	say	something,	but	she	held	up	a	hand	to	silence	me.	She	motioned	to the	door,	then	turned	her	chair	towards	her	desk	and	submerged	herself	in	the shimmering	text	that	floated	in	the	cube	of	her	com-link.	I	blinked,	taken	aback, slowly	realizing	I’d	been	dismissed.	I	rose	sluggishly	from	the	chair	and	turned to	the	door.	The	acolyte	who	had	led	me	here	was	waiting	in	rigid	silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>“When	will	we	meet	again?”	I	asked	Kieara	Cjhar	as	I	stood	at	the	threshold	of the	doorway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	will	be	informed,”	she	said	without	turning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	followed	the	acolyte	to	the	doorway	through	which	I’d	entered	the	Sentai.	The guide	was	waiting	in	the	narrow	alleyway,	hidden	in	the	shadows	by	his	hooded cloak.	As	the	door	into	the	Sentai	closed	behind	me,	he	started	forward,	not waiting	to	see	whether	or	not	I	followed.	In	silence	he	led	me	back	to	the embassy.	Only	once	I	was	back	within	the	safety	of	the	embassy’s	shield	did	I realize	how	terrified	I’d	been.	I	had	fought	on	the	front	line	against	the	Unity, both	in	the	field	and	on	the	ships,	and	had	seen	with	my	own	eyes	the	horrors	of which	they	were	capable.	But	never	once	had	I	felt	as	vulnerable	as	I’d	felt	out there	in	those	darkened	streets,	my	life	entrusted	to	people	I	had	no	right	to	trust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	yet,	I	did	trust	them.	Or	at	least	I	trusted	Kieara	Cjhar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	sleep	much	that	night.	I	couldn’t	help	but	wonder	what	favor	it	was she’d	ask	of	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a><b class="calibre3">7. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	believe	her,”	said	Burrye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	swiveled	in	the	chair	behind	my	office	desk	and	looked	across	the	room	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	mean	you	don’t	want	to	believe	her,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	scowled,	his	dark	glower	seeming	to	drop	the	temperature	of	the	room	by degrees.	“You	don’t	know	these	people,	Captain,”	he	said.	“I’ve	been	here	for two	years.	Been	here	since	the	embassy	was	first	established.	I’ve	watched	Kuhn and	his	daughter,	and	believe	me,	nothing	I’ve	seen	suggests	to	me	she’d	ever betray	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	never	made	it	clear	she	would,”	I	argued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	she	did	last	night	by	meeting	with	you—in	of	all	places	the	Sentai!—</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	be	enough	to	get	her	killed.”	He	shook	his	head.	“No,	I	can’t	begin	to accept	for	a	moment	that	she’d	have	done	what	she’s	done	without	her	father knowing	about	it.	It’s	too	great	a	risk	if	she	were	caught.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	you’re	convinced	this	is	some	sort	of	trap,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	it	is!”	he	barked	impatiently.	“What	else	could	it	be?	It	makes	no sense,	otherwise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Unless,	of	course,	there	is	indeed	something	she	wants	of	me,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Something	only	we	can	provide.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Burrye	snorted	loudly.	“Next	you’ll	be	suggesting	she	might	be	thinking	of seeking	asylum	with	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	had	crossed	my	mind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?”	he	demanded.	“Why	would	she	need	asylum?	As	daughter	of	the	prelate she	certainly	doesn’t	want	for	anything.	She	has	a	coveted	position	on	this	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why	would	she	want	to	give	that	up?	There’s	no	suffering	for	the	likes	of	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	are	many	definitions	for	suffering,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>“I’m	sorry,	Captain,	but	I	just	don’t	buy	into	it.	You’ve	met	her	once	and	that should	be	the	end	of	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	if	it	isn’t?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	it	isn’t,	we	could	end	up	with	the	sort	of	incident	that	can	start	a	war.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	if	she’s	genuinely	seeking	our	help?”	I	asked.	“During	the	war	we	never turned	our	backs	on	those	who	sought	our	assistance,”	I	reminded	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	war	has	been	over	almost	five	years	now,	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	it	has,	Jacob.	So	it	has.	And	perhaps	that’s	good	enough	reason	to	start trusting	once	more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Reds	haven’t	accepted	defeat,”	said	Burrye.	“The	Church	still	preaches	that we’re	the	enemy.	And	Kieara	Cjhar	was	raised	in	the	Church,	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you	don’t	think	she	could	have	changed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shook	his	head.	“I’ve	heard	her	preach	to	crowds,”	he	said.	“I’m	not	sure	you could	fake	the	kind	of	passion	I’ve	seen	in	her.	She	spoke	like	a	true	zealot—and not	some	wayward	soul	doubting	the	strength	of	her	convictions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On	the	ships,”	I	said	quietly,	“we	often	fooled	even	ourselves	that	we	believed in	the	war	we	were	fighting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Burrye	looked	at	me	aghast.	“The	war	with	the	Unity	was	wholly	justified!”	he exclaimed,	his	face	coloring	with	indignation.	“I’ve	no	doubts	that	what	we	did was	necessary.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	many	did	you	kill	with	your	own	hands?”	I	demanded.	“How	many	ships did	you	hunt	down	and	destroy,	knowing	that	inside	them	were	hundreds	of men?	How	many	of	your	friends	did	you	hold	in	your	arms	and	watch	die?”	I could	feel	my	rage	growing,	becoming	that	untameable	beast	that	hadn’t	served me	well	in	the	past.	I	resented	that	he	should	think	he	could	possibly	understand the	horrors	of	war	when	he	hadn’t	been	there.	He	hadn’t	stood	on	the	bridge	of	a ship	and	ordered	the	deaths	of	thousands.	He	hadn’t	heard	the	screams	of	the dying,	hadn’t	watched	the	life	drain	out	of	them.	He’d	never	had	to	make	the hard	choices	that	every	commanding	officer	has	to	make	at	some	point	within</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>the	context	of	war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would	you	have	had	us	all	under	the	thumb	of	the	likes	of	Kuhn?”	Burrye challenged.	“You,	better	than	anyone	else,	should	realize	the	war	had	to	be waged	to	prevent	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	do,	Jacob.	I	fought	because	I	believed	in	what	I	was	fighting	for.	Because	I passionately	believed	in	the	freedoms	the	Unity	would	have	denied	many	of	us	if they’d	won.”	My	face	hardened.	“You	can’t	begin	to	imagine	what	I	sacrificed	to restore	the	Empire	and	prevent	the	Unity’s	growing	reign	of	tyranny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	yet,	you	say	you	didn’t	believe	in	the	war.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	him	blankly.	“How	can	anyone	believe	in	war?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	a	spacer.	You	were	bred	for	it,”	he	charged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	I	agreed,	“they	bred	me	to	fight.	But	they	didn’t	make	me	a	bloody machine,	Jacob.	I	still	have	the	humanity	to	see	the	truth.	And	while	it	may	seem a	contradiction	to	you,	I	find	nothing	strange	about	not	believing	in	a	process that’s	inherently	evil.”	I	sighed	wearily,	feeling	all	those	years	of	conflict suddenly	settle	upon	me	like	a	great	weight.	“To	believe	in	war	is	to	give	up	all hope,	for	surely	it’s	the	court	of	last	resort.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Reds	gave	us	no	alternative,”	Burrye	argued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	for	the	historians	to	decide,”	I	mused.	“But	I’m	not	the	only	one	who thinks	we	gave	ourselves	no	alternative.	We	made	mistakes,	Jacob.	Big	mistakes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	first	ones	were	made	hundreds	of	years	ago	when	we	allowed	people	to persecute	the	Reds.	But	our	greatest	folly	may	have	been	Obsidian.	That	was	the seed	of	insurrection.	We	gave	the	Reds	a	cause.	We	gave	them	an	enemy.	We gave	them	a	reason	to	rise	up	against	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Admiral	Carter	warned	us	this	would	happen,”	I	went	on.	“He	knew	war	was coming.	And	he	knew	it	would	be	a	bad	one,	and	that	it	would	cost	us	dearly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because	nothing	good	ever	comes	of	war.”	I	closed	my	eyes	and	wished	I couldn’t	remember	all	those	years	of	conflict,	all	those	years	of	suffering.	How many	had	died	under	my	command?	I	didn’t	know.	I	didn’t	want	to.	I	knew	only that	I	never	wanted	to	see	such	barbarity	again.	So	many	had	come	to	me	fresh-faced	and	eager,	only	to	leave	my	ship	in	body	bags—or	worse. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>I	had	grown	sick	of	it.	So	sick	of	seeing	the	dead.	So	sick	of	sending	them	to their	graves.	So	sick	of	thinking	there	could	never	be	an	end	to	it.	And	so	like	so many	others	in	Fleet,	I	had	jumped	at	the	chance	for	peace.	Even	though	it	had meant	selling	out	on	so	many	of	the	principles	that	had	once	been	so	important to	us,	I	and	so	many	like	me	had	thought	it	worth	it.	Because	there	comes	a	point when	you	know	the	dying	has	to	stop—a	point	when	you	realize	there’s	a	fine line	between	fighting	for	something	you	believe	in	and	simply	fighting	for	the sake	of	fighting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	sound	like	one	of	those	peace-freaks	who	did	nothing	more	than	march through	the	streets	and	make	a	nuisance	of	themselves,”	Burrye	sneered.	“They seemed	to	have	the	notion	that	we	could	somehow	negotiate	a	peace	with	the Unity.	And	all	the	time	they	were	saying	this,	the	Unity	was	moving	deeper	and deeper	into	Federation	space,	swallowing	up	more	and	more	free	worlds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	should	have	hit	him.	I	wanted	to.	I	had	done	so	to	better	men	than	he.	What right	did	he	have	to	accuse	me	of	being	na�ve	and	ignorant	of	the	truth?	I	had the	blood	on	my	hands	to	prove	otherwise.	The	blood	of	thousands.	And	I	bore the	scars	of	what	I’d	seen	and	done.	The	scars	of	war	that	even	time	can	never completely	erase.	While	he’d	lived	safely	on	some	world	in	the	Federation,	I’d been	out	there	risking	my	neck	for	the	likes	of	him.	For	him	and	all	those	peace freaks	of	whom	he	was	so	contemptuous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	should	have	hit	him,	but	I	didn’t.	I	just	said,	“I	don’t	disagree	with	you.	But when	you’ve	fought	in	it	long	enough,	and	been	intimate	with	its	horrors,	you find	yourself	believing	that	war	can’t	possibly	be	the	only	answer.	Somehow,	to believe	that	it	is,	is	dehumanizing.	It’s	an	admission	of	failure.	And	the	longer we	live	with	it,	the	more	difficult	it	is	to	live	without	it.	In	time	we	risk becoming	like	the	people	of	Inkasar,	where	war	was	a	part	of	their	culture.	I didn’t	want	that	for	us.	I	didn’t	want	to	go	to	my	grave	knowing	the	only	thing I’d	ever	done	in	my	life	was	kill	people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Burrye	regarded	me	cynically.	“And	where	does	Kieara	Cjhar	fit	into	this	grand philosophy	of	yours?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	yet	to	be	determined.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’ll	betray	you,	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled	crookedly,	and	said,	“Maybe.	But	even	if	she	does,	it	would	hardly	be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>the	first	time—and	doubtless	not	the	last.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a><b class="calibre3">8. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	same	guide,	the	same	acolyte,	but	a	different	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	would	not	be	prudent	to	be	complacent,”	explained	Kieara	Cjhar.	“I	choose the	room	at	the	last	possible	moment.	That	way	it	is	far	more	difficult	for	anyone to	monitor	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	arched	an	eyebrow	in	surprise.	“Then	you	believe	someone	is	suspicious	of you?”” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	clear	you	are	new	to	Tradur,	Captain,”	she	said,	with	a	hint	of	cheerless laughter	in	her	voice	and	a	forlorn	look	in	her	eye.	“On	this	world	no	one	is above	suspicion.	No	one	trusts	anyone.	The	Church	teaches	us	that	from	the moment	we	are	born.	On	this	world	there	are	no	innocents.	All	are	guilty.	We	are taught	that	we	must	be	forever	vigilant,	watchful	for	those	who	might	stray	from the	path	of	the	one	true	faith.	No	one	is	above	reproach.	Not	even	the	daughter	of one	of	the	most	powerful	men	within	the	Church.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yet	you	clearly	trust	some,”	I	observed.	I	glanced	telling	towards	the	door.	“The guide	who	has	twice	brought	me	to	the	Sentai,	and	the	acolyte	who	brings	me	to you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Even	within	a	society	so	rife	with	distrust	there	are	those	who	manage	to	rise above	the	entrenched	paranoia	of	our	culture,”	she	said	matter-of-factly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	must	take	a	lot	of	courage,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“More	than	you	can	begin	to	imagine,	Captain.	This	is	not	a	world	where transgressions	are	taken	lightly.	To	defy	the	Church	is	to	court	death.	The punishment	for	even	the	most	innocuous	trespass	against	the	faith	would	be unconscionable	on	any	truly	civilized	world.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Federation	would	frown	upon	executions,”	I	warned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed	bitterly.	“A	pity	they	do	no	more	than	frown,”	she	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those	words	stung,	and	I	wish	I	could	have	said	something	to	counter	them.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>in	truth	the	Federation	was	pretty	severely	constrained	when	it	came	to	enforcing the	constitution	on	worlds	like	Tradur.	We’d	pretty	much	signed	away	those rights.	Once	in	the	atmosphere	of	this	planet,	Federation	law	was	pretty	well non-existent.	Still…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sure	the	cardinali	would	prefer	not	to	create	a	diplomatic	incident,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	afraid	the	cardinali	are	not	much	revered	these	days,	Captain.	Men	like	my father	believe	they	sold	us	out.	My	father	and	his	followers	imagine	that	we could	have	won	the	war,	and	that	their	ambition	of	a	unified	Red	Catholic	state could	have	been	realized	if	the	cardinali	had	not	been	cowards	and	agents	of	the new	Satan.	Here	on	Tradur	they	have	not	given	up	the	fight.	For	all	your Federation’s	valiant	efforts,	the	Church	continues	to	go	quietly	about	its	business on	this	world	as	though	the	Unity	had	not	ceased	to	exist.	Nothing	has	changed, for	all	your	embassies	and	your	threats	of	blockades.	They	know	Fleet	is	spread thin	throughout	the	Empire.	At	the	moment	you	don’t	even	have	a	single	warship in	this	system.	Not	even	a	ship	of	any	kind	that	is	capable	of	interstellar	jumps.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	could	change.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shrugged.	“Perhaps.	But	my	father	and	his	people	understand	that	the Federation	is	tired	of	war.	They	merely	have	to	make	the	threat	of	such	and Admiralty	backs	down.	So	you	see,	despite	everything,	despite	all	the	blood	that has	been	shed,	the	lives	that	have	been	lost,	nothing	has	really	changed	for	many of	us.	If	it	had,	we	would	not	now	be	sitting	here	discussing	this;	for	I	would	not find	it	necessary	to	seek	your	assistance.”	She	sighed	wearily	and	shook	her head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	end	of	the	war	and	the	restoration	of	the	Federation	has	done	little	to change	Tradur,”	she	continued.	“The	theocracy	remains;	the	Church	has	simply adapted.	Like	a	chameleon,	it	has	skilfully	blended	into	the	background,	but	it has	by	no	means	faded.	It	has	simply	learned	to	play	a	new	game,	working within	the	rules	your	people	allowed	it	to	dictate	when	the	Terms	of	Surrender were	drawn	up.”	She	looked	straight	at	me,	a	piercing	look	of	accusation.	“You betrayed	us,	Captain.	You	and	your	Federation.	We	had	such	hopes	when	the Federation	finally	defeated	the	Unity.	We	dared	to	dream	of	freedom,	to	be	rid	of the	Church’s	brutal	reign.	But	it	wasn’t	to	be.	And	here,	because	the	Church	has for	so	long	been	such	a	powerful	force,	none	have	been	able	to	throw	off	the shackles	of	its	oppression.	None	would	dare,	for	the	fear	in	the	hearts	and	minds</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>of	Tradur’s	citizens	is	too	great.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some	might	dare,”	I	insisted.	“You.	The	guide.	Even	that	acolyte.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	I	live	in	greater	fear	than	any,”	she	said—though	looking	at	her	one wouldn’t	have	had	the	impression	she	was	afraid	of	anything.	“I,	better	than	any, know	the	true	horrors	of	which	the	Church	is	capable.	You	see,	Captain,	the people	of	this	world	have	a	right	to	fear.	Men	like	my	father	are	driven	blindly by	their	faith;	and	in	their	blindness	they	are	capable	of	the	most	unspeakable things.	All	in	the	name	of	religion.	All	because	they	are	the	true	believers,	and thus	incapable	of	any	wrong.	God	speaks	through	them.	And	what	God	says cannot	be	challenged.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	thread	of	anger	in	her	voice	that	hadn’t	betrayed	itself	until	now.	It was	a	subtle	thing,	but	somehow	I	had	the	feeling	that	for	Kieara	this	was	like	a shout	of	rage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Things	will	change,”	I	assured	her.	“The	Church	can’t	maintain	its	hold	on Tradur	forever.	Not	now	that	the	Unity	has	been	defeated.	Not	once	people	here see	what’s	happening	elsewhere	in	the	Federation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Federation	defeated	the	Unity,	Captain;	it	did	not	defeat	the	Church.	It	is our	sorrow	and	your	folly	that	you	have	left	it	essentially	intact.	The	men	with the	blood	of	millions	of	innocent	lives	on	their	hands	have	paid	nothing	for	their crimes.	They	roam	free	while	we	who	crave	freedom	remain	imprisoned.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	we	had	destroyed	the	Church	it	would	have	meant	chaos,”	I	said	defensively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On	many	worlds	it’s	the	only	authority;	and	however	much	we	may	dislike	it, it’s	better	to	have	its	law	and	order	than	none	at	all.	Better	the	evil	you	know than	the	one	you	don’t.	Without	a	strong,	central	authority,	however	onerous, there’d	be	only	anarchy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Such	a	Pyrrhic	Victory	for	the	Federation,	don’t	you	think?	How	many	lives were	lost	to	restore	the	Federation	and	its	much	vaunted	democracy	in	the Empire?”	She	shook	her	head,	a	mask	of	painful	regret	twisting	the	features	of her	face.	“You	did	not	crush	the	Church,	and	it	was	the	Church	that	led	us	all	to war	in	the	first	place.	Can	you	be	so	sure	their	brand	of	governance	is	truly	a lesser	evil	than	the	anarchy	and	chaos	you	so	fear?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	time	the	Church	will	lose	its	hold,”	I	insisted;	but	I	was	no	longer	sure	I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>believed	those	words	as	I	once	had.	As	I	had	believed	them	in	those	days	shortly after	the	Unity	had	capitulated.	Back	then	we’d	been	so	eager	to	see	the	war ended	that	we’d	been	willing	to	believe	anything.	And	who	could	blame	us? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Especially	those	of	us	who	had	paid	the	highest	costs	of	the	conflict.	I	thought	of how	much	I	had	lost,	of	the	friends	and	lovers	that	were	gone	forever.	Looking	at Kieara,	however,	made	me	realize	that	in	our	haste	to	end	the	fighting	and	all	the death	and	destruction,	we’d	forgotten	about	the	people	on	the	other	side.	We’d forgotten	about	the	people	who	had	been	held	prisoner	by	the	Church,	forced into	a	way	of	life	they	didn’t	agree	with	but	against	which	they	couldn’t	rebel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Couldn’t,	because	we’d	betrayed	them.	We’d	sold	them	out.	Because	we	hadn’t wanted	to	pay	in	bodies	anymore.	We	had	just	wanted	to	end	it	all,	before	it	had ended	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	many	more	must	suffer	before	the	Church	does	fall?”	Kieara	demanded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	away	from	me	for	a	moment,	then	slowly	turned	that	measuring	stare of	those	brilliant	blue	eyes	upon	me	again.	“You	cannot	begin	to	imagine, Captain,	what	it	is	like	to	be	a	woman	in	the	Red	Catholic	Church.	In	particular	a woman	in	the	Church	on	Tradur.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	I	conceded,	“I	can’t.	But	surely	for	someone	like	you	the	hardships	aren’t so	great.”	I	didn’t	mean	it	as	criticism,	though	I	realized	it	might	easily	be construed	as	such. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	the	eyes	of	the	Church,	I	am	no	different	from	any	other,”	she	said	tonelessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	my	father	is	prelate	does	not	mean	that	I	am	exempt	from	the Commandments.	The	panai	will	be	as	much	a	part	of	my	life	as	it	is	for	every childbearing	woman	on	Tradur.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	panai?”	I	echoed,	pretending	the	word	meant	nothing	to	me.	But	of	course it	did;	for	I’d	heard	of	it	before,	in	the	rumors	of	Tradur	that	had	come	to	my attention	long	before	I’d	ever	arrived	on	this	planet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	panai,	perhaps	more	than	anything	else,	symbolizes	the	great	gulf	that exists	between	men	and	women	on	this	world,”	said	Kieara.	“You	see,	Captain, on	Tradur	women	are	not	even	second	class	citizens.	Indeed,	we	are	not	citizens at	all.	We	are	property.	The	possessions	of	the	state,	and	consequently	of	the	men who	run	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	will	change,”	I	assured	her,	trying	to	throw	as	much	conviction	into	my</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>words	as	possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled	at	me,	the	sort	of	patronizing	smile	one	might	expect	a	parent	to	offer a	child	who	has	said	something	foolish.	“You	speak	with	such	confidence,”	she said.	“I	almost	want	to	believe	you.	But	it	has	been	five	years	since	the	Unity fell.	Two	years	since	offworlders	finally	came	to	this	world.	In	all	that	time	you have	not	managed	to	penetrate	even	the	surface	of	Tradurian	society.	You	look out	the	windows	of	your	great	embassies	and	believe	yourself	to	see	a	world.	But you	see	nothing,	Captain.	Nothing	the	Church	does	not	wish	you	to	see.	And there	is	not	much	truth	in	the	things	they	wish	you	to	observe.	Particularly	when it	comes	to	the	fate	of	women	on	this	world.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	takes	time	to	change	centuries	of	culture,”	I	said.	“But	it’ll	happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually	even	Tradur	will	change.	Even	the	Church	isn’t	strong	enough	to prevent	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	look	the	least	bit	convinced.	“You	have	such	faith	for	someone	who doesn’t	believe	in	God,”	she	said.	“Yet	I,	who	do	believe,	see	no	hope	at	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Change	is	inevitable,”	I	reiterated.	“It	just	takes	time.	But	one	day	even	on Tradur	things	will	be	different.”	I	wasn’t	sure	whether	or	not	I	truly	believed that;	but	it	was	something	I	and	others	like	me	had	wanted	to	believe.	And sometimes	when	you	tell	yourself	something	often	enough	you	begin	to	think	it’s true. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing	is	inevitable,	captain.	Except,	perhaps,	death.	And	amidst	the	devoted of	the	Church	there	are	those	who	believe	they	will	even	circumvent	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Church	will	change,	Kieara,	or	it	won’t	survive.”	Of	that	much	I	was certain.	Not	only	was	there	no	mood	in	the	Assembly	to	brook	a	return	to	the conditions	that	had	led	to	the	formation	of	the	Unity	in	the	first	place,	but	I	felt sure	that	in	time	people	would	see	the	Church	for	what	it	truly	was.	But	maybe that	was	being	na�ve,	given	that	after	decades	of	war	and	terrible	losses	it	still remained	a	potent	force	with	the	Empire.	When	the	Unity	had	fallen	people hadn’t	simply	stopped	believing	and	switched	allegiances	and	faiths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Church	is	cunning,”	Kieara	warned.	“When	necessary	it	will	disguise	itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	has	had	many	faces	over	the	centuries	since	its	birth,	but	always	its	purpose has	remained	the	same.	The	Federation	will	have	to	be	willing	to	wage	a	new war	if	it	truly	wishes	to	change	a	world	like	Tradur.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>“It’s	not	our	aim	to	force	any	world	to	fit	a	particular	mold,”	I	said.	“But	we’re not	willing	to	forever	accept	inequities	that	would	see	more	than	half	of humanity	treated	as	less	than	human.	It’s	one	reason	why	we	fought	this	war	in the	first	place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Were	the	reasons	truly	so	altruistic?”	she	asked	with	unbridled	skepticism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Few	wars	have	ever	been	fought	for	any	single	reason,”	I	ventured.	“Often	it’s	a culmination	of	things	that	leads	both	sides	to	embrace	conflict	as	a	means	of resolution.”	I	felt	pedantic,	and	sounded	to	my	own	ears	like	one	of	my instructors	from	long	ago	in	the	Academy.	But	it	was	true	enough;	just	as	I	had said	it	to	Burrye.	The	war	between	the	Federation	and	the	Unity	had	had	its	roots long	ago	when	the	first	Reds	had	been	persecuted.	But	Obsidian	had	been	the real	catalyst.	That	had	awakened	the	sleeping	giant.	What	Carter	and	his	people had	done	there	had	been	to	open	a	Pandora’s	Box	that	had	very	nearly	meant	the end	of	the	Federation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	make	it	sound	so	difficult,”	said	Keiara. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Difficult?”	I	wasn’t	sure	what	she	meant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	has	the	impression	that	the	prospect	of	war	was	not	greeted	with enthusiasm	in	the	Federation,”	she	elaborated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	blinked,	startled.	“No	one	wants	a	war.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kieara	smiled	charitably	and	said,	“All	those	years	of	fighting	the	Unity, Captain,	and	still	you	do	not	understand	the	cardinali.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Probably	not,”	I	said	with	a	shrug.	“But	I	think	I	understood	the	men	on	the ships	we	fought	against.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	what	did	you	understand	of	them?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	they	were	human	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	years	on	the	ships,	when	we	had	fought	the	war	between	the	stars,	we	had tried	to	convince	ourselves	that	we	had	held	the	moral	high	ground.	It	had always	seemed	so	obvious.	More	so	when	one	had	distilled	the	Unity	losses	into nothing	more	substantial	than	numbers.	We	had	seldom	considered—or	had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>purposely	avoided	doing	so—the	reality	of	each	ship	destroyed,	each	planetary base	razed.	Because	we	couldn’t	see	their	faces,	because	we	couldn’t	touch	them and	hear	them,	they	had	been	less	real	to	us.	They’d	been	no	more	tangible	than the	countless	computer	simulations	we’d	all	fought	throughout	our	years	of training.	Nothing	more	than	statistics.	A	ship	blown	to	dust	here.	A	base	turned to	char	there.	To	have	thought	of	them	as	anything	more	would	have	been	to have	put	a	human	face	to	them.	And	humanizing	them	would	have	imbued	them with	a	quality	we’d	always	preferred	to	believe	was	our	exclusive	domain.	It	had been	better	merely	to	think	of	them	as	the	enemy.	Better	to	think	of	them	as numbers.	To	have	thought	otherwise	would	have	made	our	job	that	much	more difficult,	and	would	have	made	the	war	that	much	harder	to	win. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	yet,	for	all	that	we	might	have	pretended	that	we	didn’t	care,	I	knew	from personal	experience	that	that	had	never	quite	held	true.	There	were	always moments	of	silence	out	there	in	that	great	loneliness	of	space.	Moments	when you	could	sit	and	think,	dwelling	upon	the	truth.	And	the	truth	had	always	been that	in	those	ships	of	the	enemy	there’d	been	real	people.	Real	men.	Men	who had	died	hideous	deaths	when	we’d	destroyed	their	ships.	Men	who	had	become ashes	and	dust.	Men	who	had	had	wives,	and	sons	and	daughters.	Men	who	had been	sons	themselves.	And	brothers.	Men	who	had	left	behind	a	broken	legacy that	could	never	be	mended. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Often,	when	we	would	lie	in	wait	for	them,	I	would	feel	a	certain	ambivalence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ve	heard	it	called	the	hunter’s	dilemma:	the	need	to	kill,	but	the	total	lack	of desire	to	do	so;	you	begin	to	empathize	with	your	prey.	You	begin	to	doubt.	It hadn’t	been	something	commanding	officers	had	spoken	of	amidst	themselves, or	to	anyone	else	for	that	matter.	To	have	done	so	would	have	been	to	have admitted	weakness.	Any	ship’s	captain	who	had	dared	confess	to	such	feelings would	have	been	stripped	of	his	or	her	command.	Perhaps	rightfully	so.	For	out there,	in	space,	during	the	height	of	the	war,	there	had	never	been	any	room	for doubts.	Doubts	would	have	got	you	killed.	And	not	just	you,	because	as	a commanding	officer	you’d	had	an	entire	ship	and	crew	to	think	about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	we	had	sat	out	there,	waiting,	and	understanding	that	it	was	no	simple	war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Understanding	that	they,	the	enemy,	also	bled.	That	they,	too,	died.	And	that perhaps	they,	too,	shed	tears	for	fallen	comrades. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a><b class="calibre3">9. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	me,”	she	asked	upon	our	third	encounter,	“have	you	any	children, Captain?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	I	said,	with	evident	regret;	for	I’d	often	wished	that	time	and	circumstance would	have	afforded	me	that	opportunity.	It	was	one	more	reason	to	hate	the	war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	more	reason	to	have	wanted	it	to	end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	Kieara,	as	though	reading	my	thoughts,	said	“The	war.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	I	whispered.	“That	and	maybe…”	I	shrugged	helplessly.	“I	don’t	know.	I guess	I	didn’t	want	to	bring	a	child	into	this	world.	Not	during	a	war.	Not	when there	was	so	much	uncertainty.	I	knew	it	was	always	possible	I’d	be	killed,	and	it hardly	seemed	fair	to	give	life	to	a	child	and	then	leave	it	an	orphan.”	I	had expected	to	die	on	every	mission,	and	there’d	always	been	a	strange	mix	of	relief and	guilt	that	I	hadn’t.	And	each	time	we	had	arrived	in	our	home	port	I	had watched	as	fellow	officers	had	been	welcomed	into	the	arms	of	their	families	and I	had	realized	how	much	I	regretted	that	I	didn’t	have	one	of	my	own	to	greet me.	But	I’d	never	been	able	to	bring	myself	to	make	that	commitment.	Not	just for	the	reasons	I’d	given	Kieara.	I	think	there	had	also	been	the	fear	of	becoming so	connected	to	someone	else,	so	attached	to	another	living	being.	I	had	always been	afraid	it	would	affect	the	choices	I	made	when	I	was	in	command,	that somehow	I	would	pass	every	decision	through	the	filter	of	my	bond	to	another human	being.	It	had	seemed	to	me,	back	then,	that	no	commanding	officer	could afford	to	be	compromised	in	such	a	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	though	it	would	change	you,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	knew	it	would.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	change	isn’t	always	bad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	couldn’t	afford	to	take	the	risk.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	thought	you	were	going	to	die,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	“Every	day	I	was	out	there.	I	saw	so	many	friends	and	colleagues</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>killed.	I	had	no	reason	to	believe	my	fate	would	be	otherwise.	A	great	deal	of luck	can	be	attributed	to	the	fact	that	I	survived	the	war,	while	other,	better officers	didn’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	you	underestimate	yourself.”	She	regarded	me	warmly.	“On	many fronts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	laughed,	though	it	was	without	mirth.	“Perhaps,”	I	conceded.	“War	has	a	way of	humbling	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	heard,”	Kieara	began	hesitantly,	as	though	on	the	verge	of	broaching	an extremely	delicate	subject,	“that	in	the	Federation	men	and	women	are	no	longer necessary	for	procreation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	are	many	children	who	are	the	product	of	technology,”	I	agreed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Such	things	would	be	blasphemy	within	the	Church,”	she	said.	“Children	so conceived	would	be	considered	abominations.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Even	outside	the	Church	there	are	those	who	have	argued	that	it’s	going	too	far to	create	and	nuture	children	in	such	a	fashion.	They	say	that	if	these	creations could	be	said	to	have	parents,	those	parents	are	the	machines	and	the technologists	who	spliced	the	genes	and	nutured	the	cells	in	the	artificial	wombs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	we’ve	been	doing	it	for	centuries	and	I	don’t	think	we’re	any	the	worse	for it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you,	captain:	Do	you	approve	of	this	technological	means	of	procreation?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	are	places	for	such	things,”	I	said,	somewhat	more	noncommittally	than	I had	intended.	“They’ve	freed	women	from	the	tyranny	of	the	womb.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On	Tradur	women	are	quite	familiar	with	that,”	said	Kieara;	and	for	the	first time	there	was	a	distinct	edge	fear	to	her	voice.	“There	are	many	who	would embrace	these	technologies	that	would	see	women	escape	the	burden	of	bearing young.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	not	a	panacea	for	all	the	ills	that	have	beset	women,”	I	cautioned.	“And they’re	not	without	their	own	complications.	And	even	in	the	Federation,	where such	facilities	are	freely	available,	many	women	still	choose	to	follow	the	more traditional	path.”	But	not	spacers.	None	that	I’d	ever	known,	at	least. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>“Choose,”	Kieara	said	forcefully.	“There	is	the	difference,	captain.	In	your	world there	are	choices	for	women.	But	look	around	you.	In	mine	you	will	see	that there	are	no	such	choices	here.	Believe	me	when	I	say	that	such	complications	as you	have	alluded	to	would	be	a	small	price	to	pay	when	compared	with	what women	on	this	world	must	now	face.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	know	what	to	say.	I	knew	little	of	what	life	was	like	for	the	women	of Tradur.	Despite	winning	the	war,	it	was	clear,	as	Kieara	had	suggested,	that	the Federation	had	been	far	from	victorious	in	all	regards.	Sitting	there	with	her,	I was	more	conscious	than	ever	of	how	little	we	knew	about	the	enemy	we	had fought	so	hard	against	for	so	many	decades.	And	surely,	I	thought,	there	was	a serious	threat	in	such	ignorance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	me,	Captain,	have	you	seen	much	of	Tradur	beyond	the	walls	of	your embassy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	I	haven’t,”	I	said.	“And	you	know	the	Terms	of	Surrender	are	rather strict	on	how	much	access	we	can	have	without	the	authorization	of	the planetary	authorities.	Your	people	haven’t	been	particularly	forthcoming	when	it comes	to	granting	our	requests	for	more	freedom	of	movement	on	the	islands.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	my	people,	Captain.	I	am	a	woman;	and	I	am	a	leader	of	none.	On	this world	I	am	not	even	considered	a	person.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Church,	then.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kieara	inclined	her	head	slightly.	“Of	course,”	she	said	quietly.	“They	are afraid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	blinked	and	looked	up	at	me	in	surprise.	“Why	because	they	would	not	wish you	to	see	the	truth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	truth	about	what?”	I	asked,	a	chill	running	up	my	spine.	I	felt	myself suddenly	within	grasping	distance	of	what	it	was	that	was	behind	why	we’d	been meeting	these	last	few	nights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	truth	about	us,	Captain.	About	the	women	of	Tradur.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a><b class="calibre3">10. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	what	about	them?”	asked	Burrye.	He	leaned	forward	in	his	chair	and	put	his hands	upon	my	desk.	His	eyes	shone	with	a	feverish	intensity	as	he	waited	for me	to	answer.	I	couldn’t	help	but	note	that	his	mood	was	in	stark	contrast	to	the somewhat	reproving	attitude	he’d	displayed	only	days	earlier	when	I’d	first undertaken	this	venture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	nothing	to	tell,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	frowned,	and	looked	taken	aback.	“I’m	your	adviser,	Captain,”	he	said, sounding	offended.	“Anything	that	passes	between	us	is	in	the	strictest	of confidence.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	that	I	don’t	trust	you,	Jacob,”	I	assured	him.	“It’s	simply	that	she	told me	no	more.	She	couldn’t.	We	were	interrupted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Burrye’s	eyes	widened.	“Not	discovered,	I	hope.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	gave	him	a	withering	look.	“I	don’t	think	the	Reds	would	take	my	being	in	the Sentai	so	lightly,”	I	drawled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	settled	himself	in	his	chair,	suddenly	looking	smug.	“I	take	it,	then,	that	this puts	an	end	to	these	little	nightly	sojourns	of	yours,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	at	all,”	I	said	casually.	“I’ve	no	intention	of	stopping	until	Kieara	puts	an end	to	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you	were	almost	caught!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Almost,	yes.	But	we	weren’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Burrye	gritted	his	teeth	and	censured	me	with	his	eyes.	“It’s	a	senseless	risk,”	he proclaimed.	“You’re	jeopardizing	the	whole	mission.	The	Terms	of	Surrender were	quite	explicit	about	this	sort	of	thing.	If	you’re	caught—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Reds	will	expel	me,”	I	finished	for	him.	“It’ll	be	a	minor	diplomatic embarrassment,	quickly	swept	under	the	rug.	Besides,	wasn’t	it	you	who suggested	the	Terms	of	Surrender	were	a	bunch	of	crap?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>He	sat	fuming,	but	said	no	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	got	up	from	my	chair	and	went	to	the	windows	of	my	office.	Looking	out	I could	see	the	broad	avenue	of	Embassy	Row.	There	was	no	groundcar	traffic	on it,	and	only	the	odd	servobot	hovering	about,	tending	to	the	plants	that	grew	in the	median	that	ran	down	the	middle	of	the	broad	avenue.	I	shivered,	for	in	that silence	and	emptiness	there	was	the	suffocating	weight	of	oppression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	been	here	two	years	and	you	still	don’t	know	what	the	panai	is,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nor	much	else	about	this	world.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Terms	of	Surrender	don’t	make	it	easy,”	Burrye	grumped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“True.	And	it’s	for	that	reason	the	Federation	chose	me	for	this	assignment,”	I told	him.	“Because	of	my	past,	Jacob.	Because	of	what	I	was.	Because	they knew	I	wouldn’t	allow	myself	to	be	as	bound	by	the	Terms	of	Surrender	as would	any	ordinary	diplomat.”	I	looked	over	my	shoulder	at	him	and	added, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	here,	as	I	suspect	you	imagine,	as	a	reward	for	my	years	of	service	in the	Navy.	I’m	here	because	of	them.	Because	the	Federation	knows	that ignorance	is	its	worst	enemy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	fail	to	see—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	raised	a	hand	to	silence	him.	“Have	you	ever	heard	of	the	‘Angels	of	death,’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jacob?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stiffened	and	eyed	me	warily.	“Of	course,”	he	said.	“Who	hasn’t?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	you	know	what	they’re	capable	of?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	blanched	slightly.	“They	were	assassins	in	Naval	Intelligence,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Silas	Jackson’s	people.	Trained	killing	machines.	They	single-handedly	killed thousands	in	the	Unity	command	structure…if	the	tales	are	to	be	believed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Believe	them,”	I	said	tonelessly.	“I	can	personally	vouch	for	their	authenticity.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	gaped	at	me.	“You?”	he	whispered	incredulously.	“But	they	were	all Empaths.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	all.	A	few	were	Potentials.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>He	shook	his	head	and	swallowed,	looked	suddenly	uncomfortable.	“The Federation	must	be	crazy.	If	the	Reds	found	out,	you’d	never	make	it	off	this world	alive.	It’s	bad	enough	that	you’re	military,	but	to	be	a	potential	Empath…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wiped	at	his	face,	stared	at	me	as	though	he’d	never	seen	me	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	a	long	time	ago,”	I	said,	feeling	it	necessary	to	set	him	at	ease.	More	than thirty	years	ago,	in	fact.	Before	I’d	asked	for	a	ship.	Before	those	long	and	empty silences	in	space,	where	I’d	waited	for	my	prey	and	had	learned	to	abhor	the endless	killing	and	the	seeming	senselessness	of	war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	several	minutes	Burrye	was	silent.	At	length	he	said,	“We’ll	pay	for	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mark	my	words:	No	good	will	come	of	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	would	have	like	to	have	told	him	he	was	wrong,	but	history	was	against	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	out	the	window	again	and	thought	of	Obsidian	and	how	it	had	brought me	here.	Who	would	have	thought	that	something	that	had	happened	on	a	world hundreds	of	light-years	away	and	decades	in	the	past	would	have	such consequence	on	the	present? </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	instructors	at	the	Academy	had	always	said	that	history	was	in	the	details. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes	it	was	those	minor	things	that	seemed	of	no	importance	at	the	time that	ended	up	changing	the	fate	of	worlds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Obsidian	had	changed	all	of	ours. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a><b class="calibre3">11. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">For	more	than	a	week	I	heard	nothing	from	Kieara.	I	grew	concerned	that perhaps	she’d	been	discovered,	and	found	myself	watching	the	local	cube broadcasts	for	any	clues	as	to	her	welfare.	It	was	in	this	way	that	I	saw	the	public side	of	Kieara	Cjhar.	The	side	that	Burrye	had	warned	me	about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	she	was,	standing	on	a	podium	beside	her	father,	looking	out	over	a massive	crowd	of	followers.	I	was	relieved	to	see	she	appeared	unharmed,	but somewhat	less	comforted	by	her	participation	in	this	rally.	It	was	difficult	to believe	it	was	the	same	person	to	whom	I	had	talked	over	the	course	of	those nights.	When	she	took	her	place	before	the	assembled	masses	and	began addressing	them,	it	was	as	though	she	was	another	person	altogether.	Nothing	of the	calm	and	reasoned	woman	remained.	Instead,	I	sat	and	listened	to	her excoriate	the	Federation	and	all	it	stood	for,	whipping	the	crowd	into	a	fevered frenzy	with	her	words	of	condemnation.	She	spoke	of	treachery,	of	the	perfidy	of the	Admiralty,	of	how	the	offworlder	invasion	was	eroding	Tradurian	culture,	of how	now,	more	than	ever,	there	was	a	need	to	adhere	to	the	faith	and	obey	the laws	set	down	by	the	cardinali.	She	spoke	with	a	passion	that	stunned	me;	and for	a	long	time	after	the	broadcast	I	found	myself	wondering	which	was	the	act: her	meetings	with	me,	or	that	breathtaking	display	of	fanaticism	that	had	left	the crowd	chanting	her	name	and	crawling	all	over	one	another	in	an	effort	to	get near	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	began	to	have	doubts.	Perhaps,	I	told	myself,	Burrye	had	been	right	from	the start.	Perhaps	this	had	all	been	a	ruse,	a	carefully	laid	plot	meant	to	capture	the Federation	in	a	compromising	position.	But	if	so,	why	wait	so	long?	Why	had they	done	nothing?	It	made	no	sense.	And	I	could	only	trust	that	what	I	had	seen of	Kieara’s	public	persona	had	been	nothing	more	than	a	fiction,	put	on	for	the consumption	of	those	like	her	father	and	the	cardinali. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	waited	anxiously	for	word	from	her,	wanting	to	see	her,	wanting	to	know	the truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	will	you	know	whether	or	not	she’s	lying?”	Burrye	asked.	“You’re	not	an Empath.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	know,”	I	said,	certain	that	I	would.	“Potentials	can	sometimes	sense	things.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>How	many	times	had	that	“intuition”	saved	me	during	my	long	career	in	Fleet?	I couldn’t	believe	it	would	fail	me	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you’re	wrong…”	He	let	his	voice	trail	off	into	an	ominous	silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	views	on	that	are	well	known,	Jacob,”	I	said	crisply;	and	that	was	the	end of	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	days	later	I	met	with	Kieara	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a><b class="calibre3">12. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	in	the	market,	rather	enjoying	the	ambiance	of	one	of	the	few	places	to which	the	Tradurians	permitted	offworlders	unrestricted	access,	when	I	was confronted	by	the	guide	who	had	taken	me	to	Kieara	in	the	past.	I	scarce recognized	him	without	his	cloak	and	the	darkness,	but	as	soon	as	he	spoke	I knew	it	was	he. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our	mutual	friend	wishes	to	speak	to	you,”	he	said,	addressing	me	in	a	low voice	while	pretending	to	be	interested	in	the	fruit	at	one	of	the	crowded	open stalls.	“Please	follow	me,	assari.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	would	have	asked	questions,	but	before	I	could	say	anything	he	was	off, slipping	into	the	jostling	crowds	like	a	shadow	into	night.	I	had	to	scurry	to	catch up,	moving	quickly	while	trying	not	to	appear	that	I	was	tailing	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guide	entered	a	shop	and	began	conversing	with	the	storekeeper.	I	hesitated before	following	him	into	the	premises,	but	as	soon	as	I	did	so	I	was	hurriedly and	surreptitiously	conducted	to	a	room	in	the	back	of	the	store.	Kieara	Cjhar was	there,	waiting,	looking	composed,	and	not	at	all	like	the	woman	that	I’d watched	in	the	cube	only	days	earlier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	time	to	ask	of	you	my	favor,	Captain,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a><b class="calibre3">13. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	around	the	room.	It	was	a	storage	facility,	small,	cramped,	with	barrels lining	one	wall	and	boxes	piled	along	another.	There	was	a	dusty	small	window that	let	in	some	light,	but	a	glowglobe	hovering	near	the	ceiling	provided	most	of the	illumination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kieara	sat	perched	elegantly	on	one	of	the	barrels.	As	the	door	to	the	room closed	behind	me	with	a	soft	hiss,	she	lifted	a	hand	and	indicated	that	I	should sit.	I	dragged	a	box	out	into	the	small	space	that	had	been	made	in	the	middle	of the	room	and	sat	down	across	from	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	probably	wondering	what	happened,”	she	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead	of	responding	to	this	I	said,	“I	saw	your	little	performance	the	other night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	were	impressed,	do	doubt,”	she	said	somewhat	sardonically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	make	it	easy	to	trust	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed.	“What	would	you	have	me	do,	Captain?	Get	up	in	front	of	all	those fanatics	and	declare	my	defiance	of	all	that	the	Red	Catholic	Church	stands	for? </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	long	do	you	think	I	would	be	of	this	world	if	I	did	such	a	thing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	just	wondering	which	is	the	real	Kieara	Cjhar,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is,	Captain.”	She	clenched	her	fist	and	held	it	to	her	chest	in	what	was	the most	passionate	display	I’d	seen	from	her,	outside	of	her	public	performance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	real	Kieara	Cjhar	is	the	woman	before	you.	The	woman	who	must	ask	of you	a	favor	that	perhaps	I	have	no	right	asking	of	anyone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	silent,	staring	at	her,	and	sensing	in	her	a	level	of	desperation	that	was frightening.	It	was	as	though	at	any	moment	she	might	cease	to	exist.	I	could almost	feel	her	clinging	onto	something.	Hope,	perhaps.	Or	maybe	even	life itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	never	explained	to	you	the	panai,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>I	shifted	in	my	seat	and	tensed	with	expectation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	asked	you	many	questions	about	women	in	the	Federation,”	she	went	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	must	have	wondered	why.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Curiosity,	I	suppose.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	pallid	smile	creased	her	lips.	“Much	more	than	that,	Captain.	I	do	not	think that	satisfying	one’s	curiosity	would	be	worth	risking	premature	death.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you	wish	asylum—”	I	started	to	say;	but	she	silenced	me	with	a	curt	shake	of her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	would	not	be	possible,”	she	whispered.	“The	cardinali	would	never	permit	me to	leave	this	world,	as	they	will	never	permit	any	woman	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	this	favor—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	getting	to	that.”	She	smiled	again;	but	there	was	sorrow	in	her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	felt	my	heart	hammering	in	my	chest	and	I	wasn’t	sure	why	I	was	so	anxious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Afraid	for	her?	Afraid	that	she	might	ask	me	to	do	something	that	would	put	me and	my	mission	at	risk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	now	you	have	seen	enough	of	this	world,	Captain,	to	have	noticed there	are	few	older	women	amidst	the	population.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	assumed	they	didn’t	appear	in	public.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	there	were	graves	to	mark	the	deaths	of	all	those	women	sacrificed	in	the name	of	religion	on	Tradur,	they	might	cover	much	of	the	land	of	this	world,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kieara	said	soberly.	“We	are	victims	of	tradition,	captain.	When	the	original settlers	came	to	Tradur,	they	found	themselves	cursed.	Some	say	it	is	a	genetic flaw	in	the	population.	Some	say	it	is	something	to	do	with	Tradur	itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Regardless,	it	could	no	doubt	have	been	corrected,	but	for	the	fact	that	our ancestors	came	to	this	world	without	the	means	by	which	to	do	so.	There	were no	real	scientists	among	the	followers.	Understandably	so,	I	suppose.	But	the faithful	were	not	without	imagination.	They	were	quite	creative	when	it	came	to devising	a	means	to	circumvent	the	serious	limitations	the	curse	placed	upon them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>“The	panai,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	The	panai.	A	ritual	that	has	stood	the	test	of	time.	A	rite	that	has	become ingrained	in	our	society,	so	much	a	fabric	of	it	that	it	would	destroy	the	Church on	Tradur	if	it	were	removed	from	the	lexicon	of	the	social	vocabulary.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	my	efforts	to	conceal	my	skepticism,	it	must	have	shown	in	the	frown that	furrowed	my	brow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	do	not	believe,”	she	said,	as	though	she	had	expected	as	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	tend	to	judge	things	until	I’ve	heard	all	the	facts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	listen	carefully,	Captain;	for	I	would	not	wish	you	to	judge	wrongly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a><b class="calibre3">14. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	already	made	it	clear	that	the	place	of	women	within	the	Church	is	very narrowly	defined,”	she	said.	“More	so	on	Tradur	than	on	any	other	world	of what	was	once	the	Unity.	We	are	little	more	than	the	means	by	which	the	race can	be	perpetuated.	Our	place	is	to	serve	men	in	whatever	capacity	the	Church decrees.	We	have	no	rights;	and	there	are	no	choices	that	we	can	make.	From birth	to	death	our	life	is	dictated	by	the	whims	of	men.	Few	are	educated,	beyond what	is	necessary	to	satisfy	the	needs	of	men—though	over	the	years	some,	like myself,	have	found	ways	to	circumvent	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	not	always	this	way.	When	our	forebears	first	came	to	this	world	the	lot of	women	was	considerably	better	than	what	it	is	now—though	men	were	still the	dominant	force,	as	it	has	always	been	in	the	Church.	But	the	curse	soon revealed	itself.	Few	male	offspring	were	born;	indeed,	for	every	male	there	were tens	of	females.	To	the	men	who	were	the	leaders	of	the	Church	such	a	situation was	unconscionable.	It	was	clear	that	in	a	very	short	time	women	would outnumber	men	so	dramatically	that	they	would	constitute	a	serious	threat	to	the existence	of	the	Church	on	Tradur. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Red	Catholic	Church,	as	you	are	probably	aware,	forbids	genetic engineering	of	any	sort.	They	believe	only	in	the	purity	of	humanity	as	passed	on by	God.	Anything	that	does	not	fit	their	narrow	parameters	of	what	is	acceptable must	be	eradicated,	which	is	why	they	began	the	Purges	against	the	Empaths.	It is	also	why	the	curse	that	blighted	Tradur	could	not	be	rectified	as	it	might	have been	on	a	Federation	world.	So	they	did	what	religions	have	done	through	the millennia	when	posed	with	a	threat	to	the	sociological	fabric	of	their	world:	they created	a	ritual	that	would	exact	a	balance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	the	second	time	I	said,	“The	panai.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kieara	nodded.	“One	cannot	wholly	blame	them;	certainly	the	male/female imbalance	would	have	quickly	doomed	the	world.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	if	they’d	availed	themselves	of	the	many	scientific	means	by	which	such	an imbalance	could	have	been	ameliorated.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	as	I	have	already	made	clear:	they	could	not.	It	would	have	been	breaking</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>the	faith.	They	were	a	fundamentalist	sect,	eschewing	much	of	what	the	rest	of the	Empire	of	the	time	took	for	granted.	Indeed,	among	Tradur’s	Church	leaders there	arose	the	belief	that	this	was	a	test	of	their	faith,	that	God	had	set	before them	this	quandary	and	they	must	seek	a	means	to	resolve	it	without	succumbing to	the	evils	of	the	Empire	they	had	sought	to	escape.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	beginning	to	get	a	picture	of	what	the	panai	was,	and	it	wasn’t	a	pleasant image	forming	in	my	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	were	quite	ingenious,”	Kieara	continued.	“They	knew	they	could	not simply	dispose	of	all	the	female	offspring.	Culling	would	be	best,	but	in	a manner	that	would	ensure	the	continued	prosperity	of	Tradur.	On	Tradur	they found	that	women	seldom	bore	more	than	one	male,	and	never	outside	the	period of	her	earliest	years	of	fertility.	Even	at	that	the	percentages	were	still	skewed towards	females.	But	the	panai,	as	they	devised	it,	remedied	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	me	guess,”	I	said.	“Once	a	woman	had	done	her	bit	for	society	by	bearing	a male,	they	disposed	of	her.”	It	was	difficult	to	keep	the	rage	out	of	my	voice;	and I	could	feel	a	sickness	in	my	stomach	that	was	every	bit	the	equal	of	anything	I’d ever	felt	in	the	worst	of	the	war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	raise	us	to	believe	it	is	the	will	of	God,	and	that	by	serving	him	in	this way	we	are	assured	a	place	in	Heaven,”	Kieara	said	tonelessly.	“It	is	our	duty	to bear	the	young	and	then	willingly	embrace	death.	They	don’t	make	it	difficult. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	alternative	to	being	fruitful	is	a	nightmare	in	itself.	Those	who	are	barren—</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	there	are	many—escape	the	tyranny	of	the	panai,	but	theirs	is	a	living	hell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	young	serve	to	satiate	the	sexual	needs	of	those	men	whose	appointed	wives the	panai	takes	from	them.	These	women	are	kept	like	cattle;	and	when	they have	passed	beyond	the	point	of	satisfying	their	owners,	they	are	sold	into servitude.	Ours	is	a	religion,	Captain,	that	has	institutionalized	rape	and	slavery.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	of	the	Terms	of	Surrender,	and	wondered	how	we	of	the	Federation could	ever	have	agreed	to	such	a	document.	It	tied	our	hands,	prohibiting	us from	snuffing	out	a	nightmare	like	Tradur.	We	were	impotent,	bound	by	law	to sit	on	the	sidelines	and	watch	this	abomination	of	a	society	continue	to	function as	it	had	for	centuries.	Bound	by	law	to	let	the	women	of	this	world	suffer unconscionably. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	could,	of	course,	abrogate	the	Terms	of	Surrender.	We	could	go	back	on	our</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>word.	But	that	would	risk	reigniting	the	war;	and	I	wasn’t	sure	whether	even	the horrors	Kieara	spoke	of	would	be	worth	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	yearned	for	the	power	that	had	once	been	mine	to	wield.	With	just	one	well-armed	frigate	I	could	have	turned	Tradur	to	dust;	and	I	wouldn’t	feel	the	guilt and	the	anguish	I’d	sometimes	suffered	through	when	I’d	ordered	the	destruction of	enemy	ships	during	the	war.	Indeed,	I	imagined	that	I’d	take	some	pleasure	in excising	this	heinous	cancer	from	the	universe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	was	only	a	diplomat,	now,	whose	purpose	here	was	to	prevent	another	war from	happening—not	start	one.	I	could	observe	and	report,	for	all	that	that	was worth.	But	so	long	as	there	was	no	military	threat,	nothing	would	come	of	what	I sent	back	to	my	superiors.	Nothing	would	come	of	it	because	they,	too,	were held	hostage	by	the	words	of	the	negotiators	and	their	fears	of	war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	truth	is	undeniable:	we	screwed	up.	We’d	been	too	eager	for	peace.	There were	few	who	had	said	that	at	the	time;	and	those	who	had	we	had	generally ignored.	The	fact	was,	we’d	had	enough;	and	those	of	us	who	had	fought	longest and	hardest	on	the	frontlines	had	welcomed	an	end	to	the	fighting.	Anything	to stop	the	flow	of	blood.	Probably	because	we’d	known	something	others	hadn’t: that	the	Federation	couldn’t	maintain	the	push	against	the	enemy	for	much longer.	A	pity	we	hadn’t	realized	at	the	time	of	exacting	a	surrender	from	the Unity	that	our	enemy	had	been	in	a	near	state	of	total	collapse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	we	had	listened	to	the	hardliners	there’d	be	no	Church.	There’d	be	no	Tradur. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	no	panai	for	the	likes	of	Kieara	Cjhar	to	suffer.	But	we	of	the	Federation had	thought	ourselves	wise,	and	compassionate,	and	so	very	civilized.	We	had thought	we	had	learned	from	history	and	were	determined	not	to	make	the	same mistakes	that	had	been	made	in	the	past.	How	ironic,	then,	that	our	noble	ideals had	permitted	an	obscenity	like	Tradur	to	actually	thrive.	If	the	Federation	had just	held	on	for	a	few	more	months,	the	Church	would	have	been	overthrown and	I	wouldn’t	be	sitting	here	now	thinking	that	we	of	Fleet	had	failed	to	do what	we	had	sworn	an	oath	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	hurt	most	was	that	I	couldn’t	even	be	sure	I	wouldn’t	have	made	the	same decisions	as	those	who	had	negotiated	the	peace.	It	was	easy	to	criticize	them now,	but	back	then	practically	everybody	had	been	clamoring	for	an	end	to	the conflict.	I	had	wanted	the	carnage	to	end	as	much	as	anyone	else.	I	had	been	so tired	of	living	on	the	edge,	of	never	knowing	whether	I’d	live	to	see	another	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a>I	had	wanted	to	go	to	sleep	at	night	knowing	there’d	be	a	tomorrow,	knowing that	if	I	ever	had	a	child	it	would	grow	up	in	an	empire	free	of	the	horrors	of	war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	men	and	women	negotiating	the	peace	had	had	to	have	known	that	that	was the	prevailing	sentiment	in	the	Federation.	And	perhaps	that	had	made	them wilfully	blind	to	the	things	they	knew	they	couldn’t	change.	And	maybe	the suffering	of	women	on	a	world	that	lay	at	the	fringes	of	the	Earth	Empire	had seemed	a	petty	thing	at	the	time,	and	something	that	could	maybe	be	resolved	at a	later	date.	Certainly	it	couldn’t	have	been	permitted	to	scuttle	the	chances	for peace.	Those	women	had	been	but	a	few	hundred	thousands	compared	with	the hundreds	of	millions	who	had	already	been	sacrificed	and	the	millions	more	who would	have	died	if	the	conflict	hadn’t	ended.	Surely	a	small	price	to	pay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	looking	across	at	Kieara	Cjhar,	I	thought	it	was	too	dear. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a><b class="calibre3">15. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	came	to	ask	me	for	a	favor,”	I	reminded	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	drew	a	breath	and	let	it	out	slowly.	“I	have	already	mothered	two	children,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	said.	“Both	girls.	The	Church	will	not	accept	another	female	from	me.	If	I give	birth	to	another	daughter,	then	we	shall	both	perish	in	the	panai.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	if	you	have	a	son?”	But	by	the	look	on	her	face	I	already	knew	the	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	will	live	and	I	shall	go	my	way	as	ritual	dictates.”	She	smiled	grimly.	“Once they	are	assured	of	their	male	offspring,	the	Church	has	no	desire	to	risk	the possibility	of	another	female.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Either	way,	you	lose,”	I	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kieara	chuckled	dryly.	“That	is	all	a	matter	of	interpretation.	When	you	consider what	a	woman’s	life	is	on	this	world,	you	begin	to	realize	that	death	is	a welcome	release,	Captain.	From	the	time	I	was	thirteen	I	have	been	raped	more times	than	I	care	remember.	All	officially,	of	course.	All	sanctioned	by	the Church.	I	am,	after	all,	nothing	more	than	a	means	by	which	to	assure	the continued	prosperity	of	the	Church	on	Tradur.	When	I	have	served	my	purpose,	I am	to	be	discarded.	As	you	might	dispose	of	a	piece	of	worn	out	clothing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wasn’t	sure	I	could	find	words	for	how	I	felt.	To	say	that	I	was	outraged	would have	been	an	understatement.	But	I	was	also	ashamed.	Ashamed	that	I	couldn’t offer	the	women	of	Tradur	the	same	rights	and	freedoms	their	sisters	in	the Federation	enjoyed.	Ashamed	that	even	now	there	was	a	part	of	me	that	was thinking	about	the	threat	of	another	war,	and	afraid	that	what	she	was	going	to ask	me	to	do	would	be	a	catalyst	for	renewed	conflict. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	with	child,”	Kieara	said	abruptly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	felt	myself	go	cold	inside.	I	had	known	her	for	such	a	short	period	of	time,	over the	course	of	but	a	few	meetings.	Yet	in	those	few	brief	encounters	a	bond	had formed.	A	bond	of	intimate	friendship,	as	strong	as	any	honed	over	the	course	of years. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>I	had	fostered	few	such	friendships	in	my	life.	Spacers	seldom	do,	because	we understand	too	well	the	harsh	realities	of	space.	During	the	long	hard	years	of the	war	we’d	all	been	even	more	wary	of	establishing	anything	more	than	a passing	acquaintance	with	one	another,	fearful	of	growing	close	because	we’d never	known	from	one	moment	to	the	next	whether	or	not	one	or	the	other	of	us might	be	killed.	We’d	kept	our	distance,	because	it	had	been	the	best	way	to	keep our	sanity.	But	I	had	broken	that	rule	with	Kieara.	Perhaps	I	had	let	my	guard down	because	I’d	seen	no	need	to	keep	it	up,	now	that	the	hostilities	were	ended. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps	I’d	been	tired	of	closing	everyone	out.	Or	perhaps	I	had	simply	wanted	a friendship	of	the	sort	that	I	hadn’t	had	in	years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	reasons	weren’t	important.	All	that	mattered	now	was	that	I	had	opened myself	to	the	sort	of	pain	I’d	always	sought	to	avoid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	will	you	do?”	I	asked	lamely.	It	was,	of	course,	a	foolish	question.	What could	she	do?	She’d	already	made	it	clear	there	could	be	no	asylum	for	the	likes of	Kieara	Cjhar.	And	even	if	she	had	been	willing	to	seek	it,	I	knew	Admiralty would	never	approve	it.	That	would	be	just	the	sort	of	thing	that	would	fire	up the	Reds	and	set	us	on	the	road	to	war	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No,	it	didn’t	seem	there	were	any	avenues	open	to	her;	and	clearly	she understood	that	as	well	as	I	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	no	choices,”	she	said,	“but	for	the	favor	I	would	ask	of	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	listening.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	is	almost	no	medical	care	open	to	women	on	this	world,	Captain.	Except for	those	who	are	believed	to	be	carrying	a	male	child.	For	the	most	part	women have	relied	upon	a	black	market	of	services.	Not	extremely	reliable,	and	not particularly	safe.	I	have	seen	many	women,	barely	more	than	children themselves,	die	trying	to	get	abortions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	eyes	widened	and	I	regarded	her	with	open-faced	apprehension. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	a	woman	suspects	her	first	child	may	be	male,	she	will	sometimes	risk	the infection	and	disease	of	a	clandestine	abortion	in	order	to	prolong	her	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Providing	the	Church	does	not	discover	her	sin,	she	will	have	at	least	the	chance of	extending	her	life	the	time	it	takes	to	carry	two	more	children	to	term.	After which,	of	course,	there	is	the	panai.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>“You	want	me	to	get	you	an	abortion?”	I	asked,	not	quite	able	to	conceal	my shock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	It	would	be	of	no	use.	As	I	have	said:	male	or	female,	this	is	the	last	child	I shall	be	permitted	to	bear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	how	I	can	help	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	been	able	to	determine	that	I	am	carrying	twins.	The	Church	does	not know	this,	nor	will	they	ever	if	you	can	assist	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	do	whatever	I	can,”	I	assured	her	soberly,	even	though	I	knew	I	was stepping	far	beyond	what	my	mandate	prescribed.	Indeed,	I	had	no	right	to	make any	assurances	to	her.	No	right	at	all.	But	in	my	mind—knowing	now	what	I knew	of	Tradur—I	had	a	moral	obligation.	By	helping	this	one	woman	I	might	in some	small	way	atone	for	the	crime	the	Federation	had	committed	in	agreeing	to the	Terms	of	Surrender. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	have	access	to	advanced	medical	facilities,”	she	said	simply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	I	said.	“We	have	a	well-equipped	infirmary	in	the	embassy,	and	a	fully trained	medtech	staff.”	I	was	trying	not	to	anticipate	what	she	was	going	to	ask for,	but	it	seemed	clear	enough.	And	in	the	next	breath	she	confirmed	my suspicions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	will	happily	take	the	male	child	in	me,”	she	said.	“But	I	would	ask	of	you that	they	not	send	to	death	this	daughter	I	carry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	you’re	asking	is	complicated.”	In	too	many	ways. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	possible.”	The	hope	was	so	strong	in	her	voice	that	it	was	almost	a	plea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	should	have	said	no.	I	should	have	walked	a	way	and	that	would	have	been	the end	of	it	as	far	as	I	was	concerned.	But	of	course	it	wouldn’t	have	been,	because I	could	never	have	lived	with	myself	if	I	had	turned	my	back	on	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	a	doctor,”	I	said	at	last.	“You’d	have	to	see	our	medtech.”	And	I	knew, then,	that	the	die	was	cast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded.	“That	can	be	arranged.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>“The	offworld	embassies	are	closely	monitored	by	your	people,”	I	reminded	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	may	be	difficult	to	get	you	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	has	not	been	difficult	to	get	you	out,	Captain,”	Kieara	reminded	me.	“The curatai	are	not	as	diligent	as	you	might	think.	And	with	the	proper	incentive	they can	be	convinced	to	turn	a	blind	eye.”	Abruptly	she	rose	from	her	seat	on	the barrel	and	drew	her	cloak	about	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	scrambled	to	my	feet.	“When	can	we	expect	you?”	I	asked,	dizzy	with	the implications	of	the	commitment	I	was	making. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	will	be	there	when	I	am	there,”	she	said;	and	then	she	was	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stood	silent	for	a	moment,	wondering	if	I’d	made	the	right	decision.	But	when	I considered	the	alternatives,	I	didn’t	think	there’d	been	anything	else	I	could	have done.	Not	anything	else	that	I	could	have	lived	with,	at	least.	I	suppose	there	are always	choices.	Sometimes,	however,	it	just	seems	there’s	only	one	thing	you can	do;	and	when	you	feel	strongly	enough	about	someone,	the	choices	are obvious—no	matter	what	they	may	cost.	And	this	one	would	likely	cost	me	my short-lived	career	as	a	diplomat	and	probably	my	naval	commission.	But	I thought	of	Kieara	and	of	how	much	greater	her	sacrifice,	and	suddenly	what	I was	doing	seemed	very	small	indeed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a><b class="calibre3">16. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">She	came	the	following	night,	brought	through	the	rain	by	the	same	guide	who had	conducted	me	through	the	streets	of	Jehku.	Burrye	was	aghast	at	their presence	in	the	embassy,	and	proclaimed	that	by	permitting	it	I	had	doomed	us all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	unconscionable!”	he	cried.	“If	the	cardinali	find	out	about	this	we’ll	all be	expelled.	The	Terms	of	Surrender	give	them	that	right.”	He	threw	up	his	arms in	despair.	“You’ve	gone	too	far	this	time,	Captain.	You’ve	jeopardized	the whole	mission.	Maybe	even	the	peace.	We’ll	be	lucky	if	we	get	off	Tradur alive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	risked	far	more	than	we	have,”	I	told	him	bluntly.	We	both	looked	at Kieara	then,	who	stood	silent	in	the	hall	of	the	embassy,	her	dark	cloak	slick	with rain,	her	face	half	hidden	in	the	shadows	cast	by	the	hood.	Slowly	she	lifted	her arms,	her	hands	peeking	from	the	voluminous	folds	of	the	cloak,	starkly	white against	the	black	material	as	she	pulled	back	the	hood	and	shook	out	her	long black	tresses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	the	cardinali	cannot	make	me	cower	before	them	in	fear,”	she	said	to	Burrye, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“then	surely	their	power	over	you	is	far	less.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled	as	Burrye	stood	speechless,	shifting	uncomfortably,	the	wind	knocked out	of	his	sails	by	the	same	calm	and	reason	that	had	so	often	doused	my reservations	in	the	last	few	days.	“We’re	fools,”	he	muttered;	but	he	offered	no more	protests. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	him	summon	the	chief	medtech	and	led	Kieara	to	the	embassy	infirmary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	we	waited,	she	marveled	at	the	breath	of	technological	devices	available to	us.	“How	our	world	could	be	changed	if	we	had	access	to	such	things,”	she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Minds	must	be	changed	first,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Too	true.	But	with	access	to	such	facilities,	women	might	gain	a	voice.	A	voice they	have	never	had	before.	We	would	take	control	of	our	destinies	out	of	the hands	of	men	and	put	it	where	it	belongs:	in	our	own.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>“That’s	not	something	that	could	happen	overnight,”	I	cautioned.	“Long	ago, back	on	Earth,	women	fought	for	centuries	to	gain	empowerment.	Their	greatest obstacle	was	fear.	The	fear	men	had	of	losing	the	rigid	control	they’d	wielded	for so	long.	It	was	difficult	for	men	to	learn	that	sharing	that	power	didn’t	mean	they had	to	sacrifice	what	they	were.	Women	weren’t	a	threat	to	men,	but	for	a	long time	men	couldn’t	understand	this.	Perhaps	they	too	readily	perceived	women	as they	perceived	themselves.	And	since	men	had	sought	to	dominate	and	be subservient	to	none,	they	couldn’t	help	but	believe	that	it	was	the	aim	of womankind	to	do	to	them	what	they’d	done	to	women	for	so	many	thousands	of years.	That,	indeed,	must	have	been	frightening.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	pray	that	women	on	Tradur	will	not	have	to	wait	centuries	for	change,”	Kieara said,	looking	pointedly	in	my	direction;	and	I	had	the	sense	of	an	obligation being	placed	upon	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	her,	felt	a	tide	of	anguish	wash	over	me,	knowing	as	I	did	what	her fate	was	to	be.	“Revolutions	have	to	start	somewhere,”	I	said.	“Perhaps	on Tradur	it	simply	needs	one	woman	to	be	brave	enough	to	make	the	start.	One woman	to	defy	tradition	and	stand	against	the	Church.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“David	had	a	stone	and	a	sling	with	which	to	slay	Goliath,	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	words	can	be	your	stone,	Kieara.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	my	sling?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	courage	with	which	to	fling	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Words	hardly	seem	adequate	against	the	might	of	the	Church.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	can	be	the	seeds,	sowing	doubt.	A	crop	of	new	ideas	might	grow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled.	“You’re	an	optimist,	Captain.	How	refreshing	in	a	world	so	darkly pessimistic.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wouldn’t	have	survived	the	war	without	hope.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	perhaps	if	I	harbor	such	hope,	I,	too,	will	in	some	way	survive.”	But	I	saw in	her	eyes	that	she	didn’t	believe	these	words,	didn’t	believe	there	was	anything for	her	beyond	the	birth	of	her	son. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>“I	wish	I	could	offer	you	more,”	I	said	solemnly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	reached	out	and	took	my	hand	in	hers.	“You	offer	me	enough.	All	things must	have	a	beginning.	What	we	do	here	today	is	a	start.	Who	knows	what	fruit it	will	bear?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a><b class="calibre3">17. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	no	artificial	womb,”	the	medtech	cautioned.	“The	best	I	can	do	is	keep the	embryo	in	stasis.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Could	we	get	it	off	planet	in	stasis?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Burrye	interjected,	saying,	“That’d	be	impossible.	The	Terms	of	Surrender prohibit	the	transportation	of	any	concealed	material.	And	as	backward	as	they might	be,	the	Tradurians	would	recognize	a	stasis	chamber.	We’d	be	forced	to open	it	up	and	the	game	would	be	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	we’ll	have	to	find	some	other	means	of	smuggling	it	off	world,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	no	right	interfering	in	this	way,”	Burrye	argued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	have	every	right,”	I	said.	“We	have	the	right	of	compassionate	human beings.	The	conditions	under	which	the	women	of	Tradur	have	for	so	long suffered	give	us	the	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	letting	emotions	cloud	your	judgement,	Captain.	The	Terms	of Surrender—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Terms	of	Surrender	be	damned!”	I	half	shouted.	“They	were	written	by men	and	women	desperate	for	an	end	to	the	long	decades	of	bloodletting.	They were	impatient	for	a	peace;	and	it	was	easy	enough	to	ignore	the	issue	of	human rights	in	light	of	the	circumstances.	But	I	can’t	believe	for	a	moment	they’d	ever have	intended	that	we	turn	our	backs	on	the	people	who	need	us	most.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Burrye	sighed	and	shook	his	head.	“What	difference	will	this	make?	You	save one	potential	child,	but	what	of	all	the	others?	It’s	not	going	to	change	anything, Captain.	It’s	not	going	to	suddenly	give	the	women	of	Tradur	what	they’ve	been denied	for	hundreds	of	years.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’ll	give	them	hope,”	I	said,	looking	at	Kieara	as	I	said	it.	“It’ll	let	them	know that	someone	cares	about	them.	It’ll	let	them	know	that	maybe,	in	time,	if	they have	the	courage,	real	change	will	come	to	Tradur.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a>“A	false	hope,”	he	muttered.	“You’ll	be	offering	them	something	we	can’t deliver.	And	they	could	never	overthrow	the	government	themselves.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	may	be	right,”	Kieara	said	to	him.	“But	perhaps	all	the	women	of	Tradur need	is	to	know	that	defiance	is	not	wrong.	Maybe	we	just	need	to	know	that	it isn’t	necessary	we	live	like	this,	that	the	world	can	be	changed.	Maybe	we	just need	the	beginnings	of	a	revolution,	and	what	will	grow	from	that	will	be	ours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Burrye	regarded	her	grimly.	“And	what	if	such	mild	rebellion	brings	an	even more	crushing	oppression?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	will	they	threaten	us	with?”	she	laughed.	“Death?	Torture?	These	are things	we	already	know	well	enough.	As	women	in	this	society	we	are	dead	the moment	we	are	born.	But	however	powerful	the	leaders	of	the	Church	might believe	themselves	to	be,	in	the	end	they	need	us.	Without	us	they	are	doomed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	surprised	when	Burrye	said,	“You’re	a	brave	woman,	Kieara	Cjhar.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	isn’t	so	difficult	to	be	brave,”	she	said	with	a	faint,	melancholy	smile,	“when one	knows	the	time	and	place	of	one’s	death.	The	brave	will	be	those	who	do	not cling	so	desperately	to	life	as	have	I	these	many	years.	They	will	be	the	ones who	will	stand	and	fight	for	something	they	believe	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	the	medtech	now	having	finished	with	her,	she	rose	and	gathered	her	cloak about	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	should	rest	a	while	before	leaving,”	the	medtech	advised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	is	no	time	for	rest,”	said	Kieara.	“I	have	risked	much	and	many	by coming	here.	I	dare	not	linger	any	longer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Burrye	and	I	conducted	her	through	the	embassy,	back	to	the	darkened	doorway that	led	out	into	a	darker	night.	We	could	see	the	shadow	of	the	guide,	and beyond	him	the	faint	glimmer	of	the	shield	wall.	On	the	rain-slicked	avenue there	were	no	curatai	to	be	seen,	though	that	didn’t	mean	the	street	was	safe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	shall	see	no	more	of	one	another,	Captain,”	Kieara	said	as	she	stood	on	the threshold	of	the	door.	“I	cannot	express	the	measure	of	my	gratitude	for	what you	have	done.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>“It	should	have	been	more,”	I	insisted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	enough,”	she	said	confidently—though	I	wonder	if	she	truly	believed	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	still	not	too	late	to	change	your	mind,”	I	said.	“You	could	still	request asylum.”	I	could	hear	Burrye	nearly	choking	beside	me,	and	didn’t	have	to	see his	face	to	imagine	it	turning	a	bright	shade	of	red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	my	life	I	have	seldom	been	permitted	to	make	choices,	Captain.	But	I	have made	the	choices	that	I	wanted	to.”	She	turned	and	started	to	walk	away,	moving towards	the	guide.	A	few	meters	from	us	she	stopped	and	looked	back.	“Take care	of	my	daughter,	Captain,”	she	called	back.	“Give	her	the	life	I	never	had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Give	her	the	life	that	she	deserves.	And	let	her	know	it	is	always	important	to have	choices.	Let	her	know	of	the	ones	I	made.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	the	last	I	saw	of	Kieara	Cjhar	until	the	day	of	her	panai. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a><b class="calibre3">18. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Because	of	who	she	was	they	broadcast	her	panai	for	all	the	world	to	see.	It	was probably	their	greatest	mistake.	They	had	clearly	thought	to	make	a	model	of her,	an	example	for	all	the	women	of	Tradur.	She	had	fooled	them	so	well	into believing	that	she	was	a	fanatical	adherent	of	the	faith	that	they	couldn’t	have begun	to	have	imagined	the	horror	she	would	unleash	upon	them	that	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	want	to	watch	her	go	to	her	death,	but	felt	compelled	to	do	so.	No offworlder	had	ever	seen	the	panai	until	that	day,	but	by	broadcasting	it	to	the world	the	Church	couldn’t	prevent	us	from	seeing	it.	I	wonder	sometimes	if	it that	might	not	have	been	intentional.	Perhaps	a	thumbing	of	their	noses	at	the Federation,	reminding	us	of	how	our	hands	were	tied.	Or	perhaps	they	were merely	so	strong	in	their	faith	that	they	couldn’t	believe	that	anything	they	did was	wrong.	Hopefully	Kieara’s	actions	on	that	day	planted	a	seed	of	doubt	in their	minds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	public	part	of	the	panai	was	an	elaborate	ceremony.	Kieara	Cjhar	was carried	through	the	streets	of	Jehku	on	an	ornate	sedan	chair,	the	cjhavari surrounding	her,	each	one	of	these	“daughters	of	the	revered”	garbed	in	white linen	robes,	their	hair	bound	in	ribbons,	the	lower	half	of	their	faces	veiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	them,	clearing	the	way	through	the	streets	strode	the	priests	and	the minor	functionaries	of	the	Church.	Behind	them,	in	fleets	of	groundcars,	rode	the cardinali	and	the	prelate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	either	side	of	the	parade	route	men	and	women	were	gathered	to	watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hundreds	of	thousands	of	them,	chanting	and	praying,	watching	the	passing	of the	procession	with	eager	eyes.	Fevered	eyes.	The	eyes	of	the	devout. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually	the	procession	ended	in	the	large	central	square	that	dominated	the heart	of	the	city.	There,	on	a	dais	erected	especially	for	this	occasion,	Kieara	was put	to	death.	They	burned	her	alive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	before	it	all	ended,	before	they	set	torch	to	tender,	she	addressed	the	crowd one	last	time.	It	wasn’t	the	impassioned	tribute	to	the	Church	the	cardinali	and her	father	had	no	doubt	expected.	It	was,	instead,	a	last	act	of	courage—of	the sort	that	had	so	clearly	defined	the	twilight	of	her	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p63"></a>She	chose	her	words	carefully,	knowing	the	curatai	would	stop	her	quickly	once they	realized	what	she	was	doing.	“My	daughter	will	live	in	a	world	of	choices,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	cried	to	the	cjhavari	who	surrounded	the	dais,	and	to	the	women	within	the masses	beyond.	“They	will	not	have	her,	as	they	have	had	me,	and	as	they	have had	all	women.	It	ends	here;	and	there	will	be	new	beginnings.	For	we	cannot	be enslaved	and	powerless	forever.	I	have	sown	a	seed,	my	sisters.	You	must harvest	the	bounty.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whatever	else	she	might	have	said	was	drowned	out	by	the	roar	of	flames	as	fire leapt	through	the	tender,	spreading	so	quickly	across	the	dried	wood	that	Kieara was	engulfed	in	seconds.	Her	words	became	one	long,	bloodcurdling	scream, rising	and	then	falling	as	her	writhing	body	became	still	and	toppled	into	the pyre. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	crowd	roared	approval—even	many	of	the	women	among	them.	I	wondered how	far	her	words	had	penetrated,	and	feared	they’d	fallen	on	deaf	ears.	If	only she’d	had	more	time.	If	only	she	could	have	made	her	message	clear.	But	the moment	that	she	had	opened	her	mouth	the	clock	had	wound	down	quickly;	and the	message	she’d	left	was	probably	as	much	as	she	could	give	without endangering	the	life	of	the	daughter	she’d	entrusted	to	my	care. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seemingly	oblivious	to	her	words,	the	mob	carried	her	smoking	remains	through the	streets,	running	wild,	chanting	at	the	top	of	their	lungs,	acting	as	though possessed.	And	perhaps	in	some	way	they	had	been:	possessed	by	the	insanity	of their	faith. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cardinali	and	the	prelate,	however,	had	clearly	seen	the	threat	of	her	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	as	oblique	as	that	message	had	been,	they’d	somehow	made	a	connection between	it	and	offworlders.	Whether	they	actually	realized	what	had	happened, or	whether	they	were	simply	using	it	as	a	diversion	to	keep	anyone	from	thinking too	long	and	hard	about	what	Kieara	had	said	was	anyone’s	guess.	I	know	only that	from	that	day	on	we	became	virtual	prisoners	within	the	embassy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a><b class="calibre3">19. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’ll	be	over	soon,”	said	Burrye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	us,”	I	agreed.	“The	ship’s	waiting	for	us	in	orbit.”	But	for	the	women	of Tradur	it	had	only	just	started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	still	have	to	get	past	the	curatai.	They’re	looking	for	Kieara’s	daughter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	laughed.	“It’s	been	months	now.	They’ll	be	expecting	a	child.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	goodness	they’re	as	ignorant	as	they	are,”	he	mused.	“They’ll	never think	of	looking	in	the	most	obvious	place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	hope.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a><b class="calibre3">20. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stand	in	the	observation	lounge	of	the	FS	MacKenzie	and	stare	out	through	the large	ports,	watching	as	Tradur	drifts	by	beneath	us.	Such	a	paradise	from	afar; such	a	nightmare	up	close.	A	part	of	me	feels	that	I’m	abandoning	those	women down	there	at	a	time	when	they	desperately	need	our	help.	But	there	are	limits	to what	one	person	can	do;	and	it	isn’t	within	my	power,	however	much	I	might wish	it	otherwise,	to	change	a	world.	I	can,	however,	keep	a	promise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	young	ensign	enters	the	lounge.	She	smiles	at	me	warmly.	I’ve	been	getting	a lot	of	that	lately;	but	then,	they	all	know	the	truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	put	my	hand	on	my	stomach	and	feel	the	swelling	of	life	in	there.	“At	least you’ll	have	the	choices	your	mother	never	had,”	I	whisper.	“At	least	you’ll	be free,	Kieara…my	daughter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Afterword:</p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	first	released	Choices	for	public	consumption	the	story	aroused	debate	as to	the	gender	of	Captain	Morrisohn.	Some	insisted	the	character	was	female, merely	because	of	the	ending	of	the	story.	Others,	arguing	that	the	setting	was	in the	future,	maintained	that	the	character	was	male.	It	was,	of	course,	my intention	from	the	start	to	keep	the	captain’s	gender	ambiguous,	leaving	it	to	the reader	to	decide,	one	way	or	the	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	you	enjoyed	Choices	and	would	like	to	read	more	about	the	events	that triggered	the	rise	of	the	Unity	and	the	eventual	war	between	it	and	the Federation,	go	to	www.freewebs.com/lindsaybrambles	to	find	out	about	In Darkness	Bound.	In	the	novel	you’ll	discover	all	about	Obsidian,	the	events	that occurred	on	that	world	that	later	led	to	a	far	greater	conflict,	and	much,	much more.	In	Darkness	Bound	is	published	by	PublishAmerica	(	ISBN:	1-4241-6560-1	)	and	is	available	directly	from	the	publisher	or	from	online	retailers	such	as Amazon,	Borders,	Barnes	&amp;	Noble,  <i class="calibre4">etc. </i></p>
