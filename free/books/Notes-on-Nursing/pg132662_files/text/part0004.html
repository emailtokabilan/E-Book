<p class="calibre2">A celebrated man, though celebrated only for foolish things, has told us that one of his main objects in the education of his son, was to give him a ready habit of accurate observation, a certainty of perception, and that for this purpose one of his means was a month's course as follows:—he took the boy rapidly past a toy-shop; the father and son then described to each other as many of the objects as they could, which they had seen in passing the windows, noting them down with pencil and paper, and returning afterwards to verify their own accuracy. The boy always succeeded best, <i class="calibre8">e.g.</i>, if the father described 30 objects, the boy did 40, and scarcely ever made a mistake.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have often thought how wise a piece of education this would be for much higher objects; and in our calling of nurses the thing itself is essential. For it may safely be said, not that the habit of ready and correct observation will by itself make us useful nurses, but that without it we shall be useless with all our devotion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have known a nurse in charge of a set of wards who not only carried in her head all the little varieties in the diets which each patient was allowed to fix for himself, but also exactly what each patient had taken during each day. I have known another nurse in charge of one single patient, who took away his meals day after day all but untouched, and never knew it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If you find it helps you to note down such things on a bit of paper, in pencil, by all means do so. I think it more often lames than strengthens the memory and observation. But if you cannot get the habit of observation one way or other, you had better give up the being a nurse, for it is not your calling, however kind and anxious you may be.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a id="Page_64"></a><a title="[Pg 64]" id="pgepubid00082"></a></p>
<p class="calibre2">Surely you can learn at least to judge with the eye how much an oz. of solid food is, how much an oz. of liquid. You will find this helps your observation and memory very much, you will then say to yourself "A. took about an oz. of his meat to day;" "B. took three times in 24 hours about ¼ pint of beef tea;" instead of saying "B. has taken nothing all day," or "I gave A. his dinner as usual."</p>
<div class="sidenote">Sound and ready observation essential in a nurse.</div>
<p class="calibre2">I have known several of our real old-fashioned hospital "sisters," who could, as accurately as a measuring glass, measure out all their patients' wine and medicine by the eye, and never be wrong. I do not recommend this, one must be very sure of one's self to do it. I only mention it, because if a nurse can by practice measure medicine by the eye, surely she is no nurse who cannot measure by the eye about how much food (in oz.) her patient has taken.<a id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a class="fnanchor" href="part0005.html#Footnote_36_36">[36]</a> In hospitals those who cut up the diets give with quite sufficient accuracy, to each patient, his 12 oz. or his 6 oz. of meat without weighing. Yet a nurse will often have patients loathing all food and incapable of any will to get well, who just tumble over the contents of the plate or dip the spoon in the cup to deceive the nurse, and she will take it away without ever seeing that there is just the same quantity of food as when she brought it, and she will tell the doctor, too, that the patient <a id="Page_65"></a><a title="[Pg 65]" id="pgepubid00083"></a>has eaten all his diets as usual, when all she ought to have meant is that she has taken away his diets as usual.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now what kind of a nurse is this?</p>
<div class="sidenote">Difference of excitable and <i class="calibre8">accumulative</i> temperaments.</div>
<p class="calibre2">I would call attention to something else, in which nurses frequently fail in observation. There is a well-marked distinction between the excitable and what I will call the <i class="calibre8">accumulative</i> temperament in patients. One will blaze up at once, under any shock or anxiety, and sleep very comfortably after it; another will seem quite calm and even torpid, under the same shock, and people say, "He hardly felt it at all," yet you will find him some time after slowly sinking. The same remark applies to the action of narcotics, of aperients, which, in the one, take effect directly, in the other not perhaps for twenty-four hours. A journey, a visit, an unwonted exertion, will affect the one immediately, but he recovers after it; the other bears it very well at the time, apparently, and dies or is prostrated for life by it. People often say how difficult the excitable temperament is to manage. I say how difficult is the <i class="calibre8">accumulative</i> temperament. With the first you have an out-break which you could anticipate, and it is all over. With the second you never know where you are—you never know when the consequences are over. And it requires your closest observation to know what <i class="calibre8">are</i> the consequences of what—for the consequent by no means follows immediately upon the antecedent—and coarse observation is utterly at fault.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Superstition the fruit of bad observation.</div>
<p class="calibre2">Almost all superstitions are owing to bad observation, to the <i class="calibre8">post hoc, ergo propter hoc</i>; and bad observers are almost all superstitious. Farmers used to attribute disease among cattle to witchcraft; weddings have been attributed to seeing one magpie, deaths to seeing three; and I have heard the most highly educated now-a-days draw consequences for the sick closely resembling these.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Physiognomy of disease little shown by the face.</div>
<p class="calibre2">Another remark: although there is unquestionably a physiognomy of disease as well as of health; of all parts of the body, the face is perhaps the one which tells the least to the common observer or the casual visitor. Because, of all parts of the body, it is one most exposed to other influences, besides health. And people never, or scarcely ever, observe enough to know how to distinguish between the effect of exposure, of robust health, of a tender skin, of a tendency to congestion, of suffusion, flushing, or many other things. Again, the face is often the last to shew emaciation. I should say that the hand was a much surer test than the face, both as to flesh, colour, circulation, &amp;c., &amp;c. It is true that there are <i class="calibre8">some</i> diseases which are only betrayed at all by something in the face, <i class="calibre8">e.g.</i>, the eye or the tongue, as great irritability of brain by the appearance of the pupil of the eye. But we are talking of casual, not minute, observation. And few minute observers will hesitate to say that far more untruth than truth is conveyed by the oft repeated words, He <i class="calibre8">looks</i> well, or ill, or better or worse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wonderful is the way in which people will go upon the slightest observation, or often upon no observation at all, or upon some <i class="calibre8">saw</i> which the world's experience, if it had any, would have pronounced utterly false long ago.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a id="Page_66"></a><a title="[Pg 66]" id="pgepubid00084"></a></p>
<p class="calibre2">I have known patients dying of sheer pain, exhaustion, and want of sleep, from one of the most lingering and painful diseases known, preserve, till within a few days of death, not only the healthy colour of the cheek, but the mottled appearance of a robust child. And scores of times have I heard these unfortunate creatures assailed with, "I am glad to see you looking so well." "I see no reason why you should not live till ninety years of age." "Why don't you take a little more exercise and amusement?" with all the other commonplaces with which we are so familiar.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is, unquestionably, a physiognomy of disease. Let the nurse learn it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The experienced nurse can always tell that a person has taken a narcotic the night before by the patchiness of the colour about the face, when the re-action of depression has set in; that very colour which the inexperienced will point to as a proof of health.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is, again, a faintness, which does not betray itself by the colour at all, or in which the patient becomes brown instead of white. There is a faintness of another kind which, it is true, can always be seen by the paleness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the nurse seldom distinguishes. She will talk to the patient who is too faint to move, without the least scruple, unless he is pale and unless, luckily for him, the muscles of the throat are affected and he loses his voice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet these two faintnesses are perfectly distinguishable, by the mere countenance of the patient.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Peculiarities of patients.</div>
<p class="calibre2">Again, the nurse must distinguish between the idiosyncracies of patients. One likes to suffer out all his suffering alone, to be as little looked after as possible. Another likes to be perpetually made much of and pitied, and to have some one always by him. Both these peculiarities might be observed and indulged much more than they are. For quite as often does it happen that a busy attendance is forced upon the first patient, who wishes for nothing but to be "let alone," as that the second is left to think himself neglected.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Nurse must observe for herself increase of patient's weakness, patient will not tell her.</div>
<p class="calibre2">Again, I think that few things press so heavily on one suffering from long and incurable illness, as the necessity of recording in words from time to time, for the information of the nurse, who will not otherwise see, that he cannot do this or that, which he could do a month or a year ago. What is a nurse there for if she cannot observe these things for herself? Yet I have known—and known too among those—and <i class="calibre8">chiefly</i> among those—whom money and position put in possession of everything which money and position could give—I have known, I say, more accidents, (fatal, slowly or rapidly,) arising from this want of observation among nurses than from almost anything else. Because a patient could get out of a warm-bath alone a month ago—because a patient could walk as far as his bell a week ago, the nurse concludes that he can do so now. She has never observed the change; and the patient is lost from being left in a helpless state of exhaustion, till some one accidentally comes in. And this not from any unexpected apoplectic, paralytic, or fainting fit (though even these could be expected far more, at <a id="Page_67"></a><a title="[Pg 67]" id="pgepubid00085"></a>least, than they are now, if we did but <i class="calibre8">observe</i>). No, from the expected, or to be expected, inevitable, visible, calculable, uninterrupted increase of weakness, which none need fail to observe.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Accidents arising from the nurse's want of observation.</div>
<p class="calibre2">Again, a patient not usually confined to bed, is compelled by an attack of diarrhœa, vomiting, or other accident, to keep his bed for a few days; he gets up for the first time, and the nurse lets him go into another room, without coming in, a few minutes afterwards, to look after him. It never occurs to her that he is quite certain to be faint, or cold, or to want something. She says, as her excuse, Oh, he does not like to be fidgetted after. Yes, he said so some weeks ago; but he never said he did not like to be "fidgetted after," when he is in the state he is in now; and if he did, you ought to make some excuse to go in to him. More patients have been lost in this way than is at all generally known, viz., from relapses brought on by being left for an hour or two faint, or cold, or hungry, after getting up for the first time.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Is the faculty of observing on the decline.</div>
<p class="calibre2">Yet it appears that scarcely any improvement in the faculty of observing is being made. Vast has been the increase of knowledge in pathology—that science which teaches us the final change produced by disease on the human frame—scarce any in the art of observing the signs of the change while in progress. Or, rather, is it not to be feared that observation, as an essential part of medicine, has been declining?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Which of us has not heard fifty times, from one or another, a nurse, or a friend of the sick, aye, and a medical friend too, the following remark:—"So A is worse, or B is dead. I saw him the day before; I thought him so much better; there certainly was no appearance from which one could have expected so sudden (?) a change." I have never heard any one say, though one would think it the more natural thing, "There <i class="calibre8">must</i> have been <i class="calibre8">some</i> appearance, which I should have seen if I had but looked; let me try and remember what there was, that I may observe another time." No, this is not what people say. They boldly assert that there was nothing to observe, not that their observation was at fault.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let people who have to observe sickness and death look back and try to register in their observation the appearances which have preceded relapse, attack, or death, and not assert that there were none, or that there were not the <i class="calibre8">right</i> ones.<a id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a class="fnanchor" href="part0005.html#Footnote_37_37">[37]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">Observation of general conditions.</div>
<p class="calibre2">A want of the habit of observing conditions and an inveterate habit of taking averages are each of them often equally misleading.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a id="Page_68"></a><a title="[Pg 68]" id="pgepubid00086"></a></p>
<p class="calibre2">Men whose profession like that of medical men leads them to observe only, or chiefly, palpable and permanent organic changes are often just as wrong in their opinion of the result as those who do not observe at all. For instance, there is a broken leg; the surgeon has only to look at it once to know; it will not be different if he sees it in the morning to what it would have been had he seen it in the evening. And in whatever conditions the patient is, or is likely to be, there will still be the broken leg, until it is set. The same with many organic diseases. An experienced physician has but to feel the pulse once, and he knows that there is aneurism which will kill some time or other.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But with the great majority of cases, there is nothing of the kind; and the power of forming any correct opinion as to the result must entirely depend upon an enquiry into all the conditions in which the patient lives. In a complicated state of society in large towns, death, as every one of great experience knows, is far less often produced by any one organic disease than by some illness, after many other diseases, producing just the sum of exhaustion necessary for death. There is nothing so absurd, nothing so misleading as the verdict one so often hears: So-and-so has no organic disease,—there is no reason why he should not live to extreme old age; sometimes the clause is added, sometimes not: Provided he has quiet, good food, good air, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.; the verdict is repeated by ignorant people <i class="calibre8">without</i> the latter clause; or there is no possibility of the conditions of the latter clause being obtained; and this, the <i class="calibre8">only</i> essential part of the whole, is made of no effect. I have heard a physician, deservedly eminent, assure the friends of a patient of his recovery. Why? Because he had now prescribed a course, every detail of which the patient had followed for years. And because he had forbidden a course which the patient could not by any possibility alter.<a id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a class="fnanchor" href="part0005.html#Footnote_38_38">[38]</a></p>
<p class="calibre2"><a id="Page_69"></a><a title="[Pg 69]" id="pgepubid00087"></a></p>
<p class="calibre2">Undoubtedly a person of no scientific knowledge whatever but of observation and experience in these kinds of conditions, will be able to arrive at a much truer guess as to the probable duration of life of members of a family or inmates of a house, than the most scientific physician to whom the same persons are brought to have their pulse felt; no enquiry being made into their conditions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In Life Insurance and such like societies, were they instead of having the persons examined by a medical man, to have the houses, conditions, ways of life, of these persons examined, at how much truer results would they arrive! W. Smith appears a fine hale man, but it might be known that the next cholera epidemic he runs a bad chance. Mr. and Mrs. J. are a strong healthy couple, but it might be known that they live in such a house, in such a part of London, so near the river that they will kill four-fifths of their children; which of the children will be the ones to survive might also be known.</p>
<div class="sidenote">"Average rate of mortality" tells us only that so many per cent. will die. Observation must tell us <i class="calibre8">which</i> in the hundred they will be who will die.</div>
<p class="calibre2">Averages again seduce us away from minute observation. "Average mortalities" merely tell that so many per cent. die in this town and so many in that, per annum. But whether A or B will be among these, the "average rate" of course does not tell. We know, say, that from 22 to 24 per 1,000 will die in London next year. But minute enquiries into conditions enable us to know that in such a district, nay, in such a street,—or even on one side of that street, in such a particular house, or even on one floor of that particular <a id="Page_70"></a><a title="[Pg 70]" id="pgepubid00088"></a>house, will be the excess of mortality, that is, the person will die who ought not to have died before old age.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, would it not very materially alter the opinion of whoever were endeavouring to form one, if he knew that from that floor, of that house, of that street the man came?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Much more precise might be our observations even than this and much more correct our conclusions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is well known that the same names may be seen constantly recurring on workhouse books for generations. That is, the persons were born and brought up, and will be born and brought up, generation after generation, in the conditions which make paupers. Death and disease are like the workhouse, they take from the same family, the same house, or in other words the same conditions. Why will we not observe what they are?</p>
<p class="calibre2">The close observer may safely predict that such a family, whether its members marry or not, will become extinct; that such another will degenerate morally and physically. But who learns the lesson? On the contrary, it may be well known that the children die in such a house at the rate of 8 out of 10; one would think that nothing more need be said; for how could Providence speak more distinctly? yet nobody listens, the family goes on living there till it dies out, and then some other family takes it. Neither would they listen "if one rose from the dead."</p>
<div class="sidenote">What observation is for.</div>
<p class="calibre2">In dwelling upon the vital importance of <i class="calibre8">sound</i> observation, it must never be lost sight of what observation is for. It is not for the sake of piling up miscellaneous information or curious facts, but for the sake of saving life and increasing health and comfort. The caution may seem useless, but it is quite surprising how many men (some women do it too), practically behave as if the scientific end were the only one in view, or as if the sick body were but a reservoir for stowing medicines into, and the surgical disease only a curious case the sufferer has made for the attendant's special information. This is really no exaggeration. You think, if you suspected your patient was being poisoned, say, by a copper kettle, you would instantly, as you ought, cut off all possible connection between him and the suspected source of injury, without regard to the fact that a curious mine of observation is thereby lost. But it is not everybody who does so, and it has actually been made a question of medical ethics, what should the medical man do if he suspected poisoning? The answer seems a very simple one,—insist on a confidential nurse being placed with the patient, or give up the case.</p>
<div class="sidenote">What a confidential nurse should be.</div>
<p class="calibre2">And remember every nurse should be one who is to be depended upon, in other words, capable of being a "confidential" nurse. She does not know how soon she may find herself placed in such a situation; she must be no gossip, no vain talker; she should never answer questions about her sick except to those who have a right to ask them; she must, I need not say, be strictly sober and honest; but more than this, she must be a religious and devoted woman; she must have a respect for her own calling, <a id="Page_71"></a><a title="[Pg 71]" id="pgepubid00089"></a>because God's precious gift of life is often literally placed in her hands; she must be a sound, and close, and quick observer; and she must be a woman of delicate and decent feeling.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Observation is for practical purposes.</div>
<p class="calibre2">To return to the question of what observation is for:—It would really seem as if some had considered it as its own end, as if detection, not cure, was their business; nay more, in a recent celebrated trial, three medical men, according to their own account, suspected poison, prescribed for dysentery, and left the patient to the poisoner. This is an extreme case. But in a small way, the same manner of acting falls under the cognizance of us all. How often the attendants of a case have stated that they knew perfectly well that the patient could not get well in such an air, in such a room, or under such circumstances, yet have gone on dosing him with medicine, and making no effort to remove the poison from him, or him from the poison which they knew was killing him; nay, more, have sometimes not so much as mentioned their conviction in the right quarter—that is, to the only person who could act in the matter.</p>
<hr class="c1"/>
<div class="calibre6"></div><h2 id="pgepubid00090" class="calibre7"><a id="CONCLUSION" class="calibre9"></a>CONCLUSION.</h2>
<div class="sidenote">Sanitary nursing as essential in surgical as in medical cases, but not to supersede surgical nursing.</div>
<p class="calibre2">The whole of the preceding remarks apply even more to children and to puerperal women than to patients in general. They also apply to the nursing of surgical, quite as much as to that of medical cases. Indeed, if it be possible, cases of external injury require such care even more than sick. In surgical wards, one duty of every nurse certainly is <i class="calibre8">prevention</i>. Fever, or hospital gangrene, or pyæmia, or purulent discharge of some kind may else supervene. Has she a case of compound fracture, of amputation, or of erysipelas, it may depend very much on how she looks upon the things enumerated in these notes, whether one or other of these hospital diseases attacks her patient or not. If she allows her ward to become filled with the peculiar close fœtid smell, so apt to be produced among surgical cases, especially where there is great suppuration and discharge, she may see a vigorous patient in the prime of life gradually sink and die where, according to all human probability, he ought to have recovered. The surgical nurse must be ever on the watch, ever on her guard, against want of cleanliness, foul air, want of light, and of warmth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nevertheless let no one think that because <i class="calibre8">sanitary</i> nursing is the subject of these notes, therefore, what may be called the handicraft of nursing is to be undervalued. A patient may be left to bleed to death in a sanitary palace. Another who cannot move himself may die of bed-sores, because the nurse does not know how to change and clean him, while he has every requisite of air, light, and quiet. But nursing, as a handicraft, has not been treated of here for three reasons: 1. that these notes do not pretend to be a manual for nursing, any more than for cooking for the sick; 2. that the writer, who has herself seen more of what may be called surgical nursing, <i class="calibre8">i.e.</i>, practical manual nursing, than, perhaps, any one in Europe, <a id="Page_72"></a><a title="[Pg 72]" id="pgepubid00091"></a>honestly believes that it is impossible to learn it from any book, and that it can only be thoroughly learnt in the wards of a hospital; and she also honestly believes that the perfection of surgical nursing may be seen practised by the old-fashioned "Sister" of a London hospital, as it can be seen nowhere else in Europe. 3. While thousands die of foul air, &amp;c., who have this surgical nursing to perfection, the converse is comparatively rare.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Children: their greater susceptibility to the same things.</div>
<p class="calibre2">To revert to children. They are much more susceptible than grown people to all noxious influences. They are affected by the same things, but much more quickly and seriously, viz., by want of fresh air, of proper warmth, want of cleanliness in house, clothes, bedding, or body, by startling noises, improper food, or want of punctuality, by dulness and by want of light, by too much or too little covering in bed, or when up, by want of the spirit of management generally in those in charge of them. One can, therefore, only press the importance, as being yet greater in the case of children, greatest in the case of sick children, of attending to these things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That which, however, above all, is known to injure children seriously is foul air, and most seriously at night. Keeping the rooms where they sleep tight shut up, is destruction to them. And, if the child's breathing be disordered by disease, a few hours only of such foul air may endanger its life, even where no inconvenience is felt by grown-up persons in the same room.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The following passages, taken out of an excellent "Lecture on Sudden Death in Infancy and Childhood," just published, show the vital importance of careful nursing of children. "In the great majority of instances, when death suddenly befalls the infant or young child, it is an <i class="calibre8">accident</i>; it is not a necessary, inevitable result of any disease from which it is suffering."</p>
<p class="calibre2">It may be here added, that it would be very desirable to know how often death is, with adults, "not a necessary, inevitable result of any disease." Omit the word "sudden;" (for <i class="calibre8">sudden</i> death is comparatively rare in middle age;) and the sentence is almost equally true for all ages.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The following causes of "accidental" death in sick children are enumerated:—"Sudden noises, which startle—a rapid change of temperature, which chills the surface, though only for a moment—a rude awakening from sleep—or even an over-hasty, or an over-full meal"—"any sudden impression on the nervous system—any hasty alteration of posture—in short, any cause whatever by which the respiratory process may be disturbed."</p>
<p class="calibre2">It may again be added, that, with very weak adult patients, these causes are also (not often "suddenly fatal," it is true, but) very much oftener than is at all generally known, irreparable in their consequences.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Both for children and for adults, both for sick and for well (although more certainly in the case of sick children than in any others), I would here again repeat, the most frequent and most fatal cause of all is sleeping, for even a few hours, much more for weeks and months, in foul air, a condition which, more than any <a id="Page_73"></a><a title="[Pg 73]" id="pgepubid00092"></a>other condition, disturbs the respiratory process, and tends to produce "accidental" death in disease.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I need hardly here repeat the warning against any confusion of ideas between cold and fresh air. You may chill a patient fatally without giving him fresh air at all. And you can quite well, nay, much better, give him fresh air without chilling him. This is the test of a good nurse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In cases of long recurring faintnesses from disease, for instance, especially disease which affects the organs of breathing, fresh air to the lungs, warmth to the surface, and often (as soon as the patient can swallow) hot drink, these are the right remedies and the only ones. Yet, oftener than not, you see the nurse or mother just reversing this; shutting up every cranny through which fresh air can enter, and leaving the body cold, or perhaps throwing a greater weight of clothes upon it, when already it is generating too little heat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Breathing carefully, anxiously, as though respiration were a function which required all the attention for its performance," is cited as a not unusual state in children, and as one calling for care in all the things enumerated above. That breathing becomes an almost voluntary act, even in grown up patients who are very weak, must often have been remarked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">"Disease having interfered with the perfect accomplishment of the respiratory function, some sudden demand for its complete exercise, issues in the sudden standstill of the whole machinery," is given as one process:—"life goes out for want of nervous power to keep the vital functions in activity," is given as another, by which "accidental" death is most often brought to pass in infancy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Also in middle age, both these processes may be seen ending in death, although generally not suddenly. And I have seen, even in middle age, the "<i class="calibre8">sudden</i> stand-still" here mentioned, and from the same causes.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Summary.</div>
<p class="calibre2">To sum up:—the answer to two of the commonest objections urged, one by women themselves, the other by men, against the desirableness of sanitary knowledge for women, <i class="calibre8">plus</i> a caution, comprises the whole argument for the art of nursing.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Reckless amateur physicking by women. Real knowledge of the laws of health alone can check this.</div>
<p class="calibre2">(1.) It is often said by men, that it is unwise to teach women anything about these laws of health, because they will take to physicking,—that there is a great deal too much of amateur physicking as it is, which is indeed true. One eminent physician told me that he had known more calomel given, both at a pinch and for a continuance, by mothers, governesses, and nurses, to children than he had ever heard of a physician prescribing in all his experience. Another says, that women's only idea in medicine is calomel and aperients. This is undeniably too often the case. There is nothing ever seen in any professional practice like the reckless physicking by amateur females.<a id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a class="fnanchor" href="part0005.html#Footnote_39_39">[39]</a> But this is just what the really experienced and <a id="Page_74"></a><a title="[Pg 74]" id="pgepubid00093"></a>observing nurse does <i class="calibre8">not</i> do; she neither physics herself nor others. And to cultivate in things pertaining to health observation and experience in women who are mothers, governesses or nurses, is just the way to do away with amateur physicking, and if the doctors did but know it, to make the nurses obedient to them,—helps to them instead of hindrances. Such education in women would indeed diminish the doctor's work—but no one really believes that doctors wish that there should be more illness, in order to have more work.</p>
<div class="sidenote">What pathology teaches. What observation alone teaches. What medicine does. What nature alone does.</div>
<p class="calibre2">(2.) It is often said by women, that they cannot know anything of the laws of health, or what to do to preserve their children's health, because they can know nothing of "Pathology," or cannot "dissect,"—a confusion of ideas which it is hard to attempt to disentangle. Pathology teaches the harm that disease has done. But it teaches nothing more. We know nothing of the principle of health, the positive of which pathology is the negative, except from observation and experience. And nothing but observation and experience will teach us the ways to maintain or to bring back the state of health. It is often thought that medicine is the curative process. It is no such thing; medicine is the surgery of functions, as surgery proper is that of limbs and organs. Neither can do anything but remove obstructions; neither can cure; nature alone cures. Surgery removes the <a id="Page_75"></a><a title="[Pg 75]" id="pgepubid00094"></a>bullet out of the limb, which is an obstruction to cure, but nature heals the wound. So it is with medicine; the function of an organ becomes obstructed; medicine, so far as we know, assists nature to remove the obstruction, but does nothing more. And what nursing has to do in either case, is to put the patient in the best condition for nature to act upon him. Generally, just the contrary is done. You think fresh air, and quiet and cleanliness extravagant, perhaps dangerous, luxuries, which should be given to the patient only when quite convenient, and medicine the <i class="calibre8">sine quâ non</i>, the panacea. If I have succeeded in any measure in dispelling this illusion, and in showing what true nursing is, and what it is not, my object will have been answered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now for the caution:—</p>
<p class="calibre2">(3.) It seems a commonly received idea among men and even among women themselves that it requires nothing but a disappointment in love, the want of an object, a general disgust, or incapacity for other things, to turn a woman into a good nurse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This reminds one of the parish where a stupid old man was set to be schoolmaster because he was "past keeping the pigs."</p>
<p class="calibre2">Apply the above receipt for making a good nurse to making a good servant. And the receipt will be found to fail.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet popular novelists of recent days have invented ladies disappointed in love or fresh out of the drawing-room turning into the war-hospitals to find their wounded lovers, and when found, forthwith abandoning their sick-ward for their lover, as might be expected. Yet in the estimation of the authors, these ladies were none the worse for that, but on the contrary were heroines of nursing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What cruel mistakes are sometimes made by benevolent men and women in matters of business about which they can know nothing and think they know a great deal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The everyday management of a large ward, let alone of a hospital—the knowing what are the laws of life and death for men, and what the laws of health for wards—(and wards are healthy or unhealthy, mainly according to the knowledge or ignorance of the nurse)—are not these matters of sufficient importance and difficulty to require learning by experience and careful inquiry, just as much as any other art? They do not come by inspiration to the lady disappointed in love, nor to the poor workhouse drudge hard up for a livelihood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And terrible is the injury which has followed to the sick from such wild notions!</p>
<p class="calibre2">In this respect (and why is it so?), in Roman Catholic countries, both writers and workers are, in theory at least, far before ours. They would never think of such a beginning for a good working Superior or Sister of Charity. And many a Superior has refused to admit a <i class="calibre8">Postulant</i> who appeared to have no better "vocation" or reasons for offering herself than these.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is true <i class="calibre8">we</i> make "no vows." But is a "vow" necessary to convince us that the true spirit for learning any art, most especially an art of charity, aright, is not a disgust to everything or something <a id="Page_76"></a><a title="[Pg 76]" id="pgepubid00095"></a>else? Do we really place the love of our kind (and of nursing, as one branch of it,) so low as this? What would the Mère Angélique of Port Royal, what would our own Mrs. Fry have said to this?</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p class="calibre2"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—I would earnestly ask my sisters to keep clear of both the jargons now current everywhere (for they <i class="calibre8">are</i> equally jargons); of the jargon, namely, about the "rights" of women, which urges women to do all that men do, including the medical and other professions, merely because men do it, and without regard to whether this <i class="calibre8">is</i> the best that women can do; and of the jargon which urges women to do nothing that men do, merely because they are women, and should be "recalled to a sense of their duty as women," and because "this is women's work," and "that is men's," and "these are things which women should not do," which is all assertion and nothing more. Surely woman should bring the best she has, <i class="calibre8">whatever</i> that is, to the work of God's world, without attending to either of these cries. For what are they, both of them, the one <i class="calibre8">just</i> as much as the other, but listening to the "what people will say," to opinion, to the "voices from without?" And as a wise man has said, no one has ever done anything great or useful by listening to the voices from without.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You do not want the effect of your good things to be, "How wonderful for a <i class="calibre8">woman</i>!" nor would you be deterred from good things, by hearing it said, "Yes, but she ought not to have done this, because it is not suitable for a woman." But you want to do the thing that is good, whether it is "suitable for a woman" or not.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It does not make a thing good, that it is remarkable that a woman should have been able to do it. Neither does it make a thing bad, which would have been good had a man done it, that it has been done by a woman.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Oh, leave these jargons, and go your way straight to God's work, in simplicity and singleness of heart.</p>

<h3 id="pgepubid00104" class="calibre5"><span class="smcap1">Note as to the Number of Women employed as Nurses in Great Britain.</span></h3>
<p class="calibre2">25,466 were returned, at the census of 1851, as nurses by profession, 39,139 nurses in domestic service,<a id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a class="fnanchor" href="part0006.html#Footnote_40_40">[40]</a> and 2,822 midwives. The numbers of different ages are shown in table A, and in table B their distribution over Great Britain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To increase the efficiency of this class, and to make as many of them as possible the disciples of the true doctrines of health, would be a great national work.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For there the material exists, and will be used for nursing, whether the real "conclusion of the matter" be to nurse or to poison the sick. A man, who stands perhaps at the head of our medical profession, once said to me, I send a nurse into a private family to nurse the sick, but I know that it is only to do them harm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now a nurse means any person in charge of the personal health of another. And, in the preceding notes, the term <i class="calibre8">nurse</i> is used indiscriminately for amateur and professional nurses. For, besides nurses of the sick and nurses of children, the numbers of whom are here given, there are friends or relations who take temporary charge of a sick person, there are mothers of families. It appears as if these unprofessional nurses were just as much in want of knowledge of the laws of health as professional ones.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then there are the school-mistresses of all national and other schools throughout the kingdom. How many of children's epidemics originate in these! Then the proportion of girls in these schools, who become mothers or members among the 64,600 nurses recorded above, or schoolmistresses in their turn. If the laws of health, as far as regards fresh air, cleanliness, light, &amp;c., were taught to these, would this not prevent some children being killed, some evil being perpetuated? On women we must depend, first and last, for personal and household hygiene—for preventing the race from degenerating in as far as these things are concerned. Would not the true way of infusing the art of preserving its own health into the human race be to teach the female part of it in schools and hospitals, both by practical teaching and by simple experiments, in as far as these illustrate what may be called the theory of it?</p>

<p class="calibre2"><span class="sidenote1">Curious deductions from an excessive death rate.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon this fact the most wonderful deductions have been strung. For a long time an announcement something like the following has been going the round of the papers:—"More than 25,000 children die every year in London under 10 years of age; therefore we want a Children's Hospital." This spring there was a prospectus issued, and divers other means taken to this effect:—"There is a great want of sanitary knowledge in women; therefore we want a Women's Hospital." Now, both the above facts are too sadly true. But what is the deduction? The causes of the enormous child mortality are perfectly well known; they are chiefly want of cleanliness, want of ventilation, want of white-washing; in one word, defective <i class="calibre8">household</i> hygiene. The remedies are just as well known; and among them is certainly not the establishment of a Child's Hospital. This may be a want; just as there may be a want of hospital room for adults. But the Registrar-General would certainly never think of giving us as a cause for the high rate of child mortality in (say) Liverpool that there was not sufficient hospital room for children; nor would he urge upon us, as a remedy, to found a hospital for them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Again, women, and the best women, are wofully deficient in sanitary knowledge; although it is to women that we must look, first and last, for its application, as far as <i class="calibre8">household</i> hygiene is concerned. But who would ever think of citing the institution of a Women's Hospital as the way to cure this want?</p>
<p class="calibre2">We have it, indeed, upon very high authority that there is some fear lest hospitals, as they have been <i class="calibre8">hitherto</i>, may not have generally increased, rather than diminished, the rate of mortality—especially of child mortality.</p>
