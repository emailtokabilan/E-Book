<p class="calibre2">The houses of the grandmothers and great grandmothers of this generation, at least the country houses, with front door and back door always standing open, winter and summer, and a thorough draught always blowing through—with all the scrubbing, and cleaning, and polishing, and scouring which used to go on, the grandmothers, and still more the great grandmothers, always out of doors and never with a bonnet on except to go to church, these things entirely account for the fact so often seen of a great grandmother, who was a tower of physical vigour descending into a grandmother perhaps a little less vigorous but still sound as a bell and healthy to the core, into a mother languid and confined to her carriage and house, and lastly into a daughter sickly and confined to her bed. For, remember, even with a general decrease of mortality you may often find a race thus degenerating and still oftener a family. You may see poor little feeble washed-out rags, children of a noble stock, suffering morally and physically, throughout their useless, degenerate <a id="Page_19"></a><a title="[Pg 19]" id="pgepubid00026"></a>lives, and yet people who are going to marry and to bring more such into the world, will consult nothing but their own convenience as to where they are to live, or how they are to live.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Don't make your sick-room into a ventilating shaft for the whole house.</div>
<p class="calibre2">With regard to the health of houses where there is a sick person, it often happens that the sick room is made a ventilating shaft for the rest of the house. For while the house is kept as close, unaired, and dirty as usual, the window of the sick room is kept a little open always, and the door occasionally. Now, there are certain sacrifices which a house with one sick person in it does make to that sick person: it ties up its knocker; it lays straw before it in the street. Why can't it keep itself thoroughly clean and unusually well aired, in deference to the sick person?</p>
<div class="sidenote">Infection.</div>
<p class="calibre2">We must not forget what, in ordinary language, is called "Infection;"<a id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a class="fnanchor" href="part0005.html#Footnote_10_10">[10]</a>—a thing of which people are generally so afraid that they frequently follow the very practice in regard to it which they ought to avoid. Nothing used to be considered so infectious or contagious as small pox; and people not very long ago used to cover up patients with heavy bed clothes, while they kept up large fires and shut the windows. Small pox, of course, under this <i class="calibre8">régime</i>, is very "infectious." People are somewhat wiser now in their management of this disease. They have ventured to cover the patients lightly and to keep the windows open; and we hear much less of the "infection" of small pox than we used to do. But do people in our days act with more wisdom on the subject of "infection" in fevers—scarlet fever, measles, &amp;c.—than their forefathers did with small pox? Does not the popular idea of "infection" involve that people should take greater care of themselves than of the patient? that, for instance, it is safer not to be too much with the patient, not to attend too much to his wants? Perhaps the best illustration of the utter absurdity of this view of duty in attending on "infectious" diseases is afforded by what was very recently the practice, if it is <a id="Page_20"></a><a title="[Pg 20]" id="pgepubid00027"></a>not so even now, in some of the European lazarets—in which the plague-patient used to be condemned to the horrors of filth, overcrowding, and want of ventilation, while the medical attendant was ordered to examine the patient's tongue through an opera-glass and to toss him a lancet to open his abscesses with!</p>
<p class="calibre2">True nursing ignores infection, except to prevent it. Cleanliness and fresh air from open windows, with unremitting attention to the patient, are the only defence a true nurse either asks or needs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wise and humane management of the patient is the best safeguard against infection.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Why must children have measles, &amp;c.?</div>
<p class="calibre2">There are not a few popular opinions, in regard to which it is useful at times to ask a question or two. For example, it is commonly thought that children must have what are commonly called "children's epidemics," "current contagions," &amp;c., in other words, that they are born to have measles, hooping-cough, perhaps even scarlet fever, just as they are born to cut their teeth, if they live.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, do tell us, why must a child have measles?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Oh because, you say, we cannot keep it from infection—other children have measles—and it must take them—and it is safer that it should.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But why must other children have measles? And if they have, why must yours have them too?</p>
<p class="calibre2">If you believed in and observed the laws for preserving the health of houses which inculcate cleanliness, ventilation, white-washing, and other means, and which, by the way, <i class="calibre8">are laws</i>, as implicitly as you believe in the popular opinion, for it is nothing more than an opinion, that your child must have children's epidemics, don't you think that upon the whole your child would be more likely to escape altogether?</p>

<div class="calibre6"></div><h2 id="pgepubid00028" class="calibre7"><a id="III_PETTY_MANAGEMENT" class="calibre9"></a>III. PETTY MANAGEMENT.</h2>
<div class="sidenote">Petty management.</div>
<p class="calibre2">All the results of good nursing, as detailed in these notes, may be spoiled or utterly negatived by one defect, viz.: in petty management, or, in other words, by not knowing how to manage that what you do when you are there, shall be done when you are not there. The most devoted friend or nurse cannot be always <i class="calibre8">there</i>. Nor is it desirable that she should. And she may give up her health, all her other duties, and yet, for want of a little management, be not one-half so efficient as another who is not one-half so devoted, but who has this art of multiplying herself—that is to say, the patient of the first will not really be so well cared for, as the patient of the second.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is as impossible in a book to teach a person in charge of sick how to <i class="calibre8">manage</i>, as it is to teach her how to nurse. Circumstances must vary with each different case. But it <i class="calibre8">is</i> possible to press upon her to think for herself: Now what does happen during my absence? I am obliged to be away on Tuesday. But fresh air, or punctuality is not less important to my patient on Tuesday than it was on<a id="Page_21"></a><a title="[Pg 21]" id="pgepubid00029"></a> Monday. Or: At 10 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> I am never with my patient; but quiet is of no less consequence to him at 10 than it was at 5 minutes to 10.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Curious as it may seem, this very obvious consideration occurs comparatively to few, or, if it does occur, it is only to cause the devoted friend or nurse to be absent fewer hours or fewer minutes from her patient—not to arrange so as that no minute and no hour shall be for her patient without the essentials of her nursing.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Illustrations of the want of it.</div>
<p class="calibre2">A very few instances will be sufficient, not as precepts, but as illustrations.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Strangers coming into the sick room.</div>
<p class="calibre2">A strange washerwoman, coming late at night for the "things," will burst in by mistake to the patient's sick-room, after he has fallen into his first doze, giving him a shock, the effects of which are irremediable, though he himself laughs at the cause, and probably never even mentions it. The nurse who is, and is quite right to be, at her supper, has not provided that the washerwoman shall not lose her way and go into the wrong room.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Sick room airing the whole house.</div>
<p class="calibre2">The patient's room may always have the window open. But the passage outside the patient's room, though provided with several large windows, may never have one open. Because it is not understood that the charge of the sick-room extends to the charge of the passage. And thus, as often happens, the nurse makes it her business to turn the patient's room into a ventilating shaft for the foul air of the whole house.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Uninhabited room fouling the whole house.</div>
<p class="calibre2">An uninhabited room, a newly painted room,<a id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a class="fnanchor" href="part0005.html#Footnote_11_11">[11]</a> an uncleaned closet or cupboard, may often become a reservoir of foul air for the whole house, because the person in charge never thinks of arranging that these places shall be always aired, always cleaned; she merely opens the window herself "when she goes in."</p>
<div class="sidenote">Delivery and non-delivery of letters and messages.</div>
<p class="calibre2">An agitating letter or message may be delivered, or an important letter or message <i class="calibre8">not</i> delivered; a visitor whom it was of consequence to see, may be refused, or one whom it was of still more consequence <i class="calibre8">not</i> to see may be admitted—because the person in charge has never asked herself this question, What is done when I am not there?<a id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a class="fnanchor" href="part0005.html#Footnote_12_12">[12]</a></p>
<p class="calibre2">At all events, one may safely say, a nurse cannot be with the <a id="Page_22"></a><a title="[Pg 22]" id="pgepubid00030"></a>patient, open the door, eat her meals, take a message, all at one and the same time. Nevertheless the person in charge never seems to look the impossibility in the face.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Add to this that the <i class="calibre8">attempting</i> this impossibility does more to increase the poor Patient's hurry and nervousness than anything else.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Partial measures such as "being always in the way" yourself, increase instead of saving the patient's anxiety. Because they must be only partial.</div>
<p class="calibre2">It is never thought that the patient remembers these things if you do not. He has not only to think whether the visit or letter may arrive, but whether you will be in the way at the particular day and hour when it may arrive. So that your <i class="calibre8">partial</i> measures for "being in the way" yourself, only increase the necessity for his thought. Whereas, if you could but arrange that the thing should always be done whether you are there or not, he need never think at all about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the above reasons, whatever a patient <i class="calibre8">can</i> do for himself, it is better, <i class="calibre8">i.e.</i> less anxiety, for him to do for himself, unless the person in charge has the spirit of management.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is evidently much less exertion for a patient to answer a letter for himself by return of post, than to have four conversations, wait five days, have six anxieties before it is off his mind, before the person who is to answer it has done so.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Apprehension, uncertainty, waiting, expectation, fear of surprise, do a patient more harm than any exertion. Remember, he is face to face with his enemy all the time, internally wrestling with him, having long imaginary conversations with him. You are thinking of something else. "Rid him of his adversary quickly," is a first rule with the sick.<a id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a class="fnanchor" href="part0005.html#Footnote_13_13">[13]</a></p>
<p class="calibre2">For the same reasons, always tell a patient and tell him beforehand when you are going out and when you will be back, whether it is for a day, an hour, or ten minutes. You fancy perhaps that it is better for him if he does not find out your going at all, better for him if you do not make yourself "of too much importance" to him; or else you cannot bear to give him the pain or the anxiety of the temporary separation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No such thing. You <i class="calibre8">ought</i> to go, we will suppose. Health or duty requires it. Then say so to the patient openly. If you go without his knowing it, and he finds it out, he never will feel secure again that the things which depend upon you will be done when you are away, and in nine cases out of ten he will be right. If you go out without telling him when you will be back, he can take no measures nor precautions as to the things which concern you both, or which you do for him.</p>
<div class="sidenote">What is the cause of half the accidents which happen?</div>
<p class="calibre2">If you look into the reports of trials or accidents, and especially of suicides, or into the medical history of fatal cases, it is almost incredible how often the whole thing turns upon something which <a id="Page_23"></a><a title="[Pg 23]" id="pgepubid00031"></a>has happened because "he," or still oftener "she," "was not there." But it is still more incredible how often, how almost always this is accepted as a sufficient reason, a justification; why, the very fact of the thing having happened is the proof of its not being a justification. The person in charge was quite right not to be "<i class="calibre8">there</i>", he was called away for quite sufficient reason, or he was away for a daily recurring and unavoidable cause: yet no provision was made to supply his absence. The fault was not in his "being away," but in there being no management to supplement his "being away." When the sun is under a total eclipse or during his nightly absence, we light candles. But it would seem as if it did not occur to us that we must also supplement the person in charge of sick or of children, whether under an occasional eclipse or during a regular absence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In institutions where many lives would be lost and the effect of such want of management would be terrible and patent, there is less of it than in the private house.<a id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a class="fnanchor" href="part0005.html#Footnote_14_14">[14]</a></p>
<p class="calibre2"><a id="Page_24"></a><a title="[Pg 24]" id="pgepubid00032"></a></p>
<p class="calibre2">But in both, let whoever is in charge keep this simple question in her head (<i class="calibre8">not</i>, how can I always do this right thing myself, but) how can I provide for this right thing to be always done?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, when anything wrong has actually happened in consequence of her absence, which absence we will suppose to have been quite right, let her question still be (<i class="calibre8">not</i>, how can I provide against any more of such absences? which is neither possible nor desirable, but) how can I provide against any thing wrong arising out of my absence?</p>
<div class="sidenote">What it is to be "in charge."</div>
<p class="calibre2">How few men, or even women, understand, either in great or in little things, what it is the being "in charge"—I mean, know how to carry out a "charge." From the most colossal calamities, down to the most trifling accidents, results are often traced (or rather <i class="calibre8">not</i> traced) to such want of some one "in charge" or of his knowing how to be "in charge." A short time ago the bursting of a funnel-casing on board the finest and strongest ship that ever was built, on her trial trip, destroyed several lives and put several hundreds in jeopardy—not from any undetected flaw in her new and untried works—but from a tap being closed which ought not to have been closed—from what every child knows would make its mother's tea-kettle burst. And this simply because no one seemed to know what it is to be "in charge," or <i class="calibre8">who</i> was in charge. Nay more, the jury at the inquest actually altogether ignored the same, and apparently considered the tap "in charge," for they gave as a verdict "accidental death."</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is the meaning of the word, on a large scale. On a much smaller scale, it happened, a short time ago, that an insane person burnt herself slowly and intentionally to death, while in her doctor's charge and almost in her nurse's presence. Yet neither was considered "at all to blame." The very fact of the accident happening proves its own case. There is nothing more to be said. Either they did not know their business or they did not know how to perform it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To be "in charge" is certainly not only to carry out the proper measures yourself but to see that every one else does so too; to see that no one either wilfully or ignorantly thwarts or prevents such measures. It is neither to do everything yourself nor to appoint a number of people to each duty, but to ensure that each does that duty to which he is appointed. This is the meaning which must be attached to the word by (above all) those "in charge" of sick, whether of numbers or of individuals, (and indeed I think it is with individual sick that it is least understood. One sick person is often waited on by four with less precision, and is really less cared for than ten who are waited on by one; or at least than 40 who are waited on by 4; and all for want of this one person "in charge.)"</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a id="Page_25"></a><a title="[Pg 25]" id="pgepubid00033"></a></p>
<p class="calibre2">It is often said that there are few good servants now: I say there are few good mistresses now. As the jury seems to have thought the tap was in charge of the ship's safety, so mistresses now seem to think the house is in charge of itself. They neither know how to give orders, nor how to teach their servants to obey orders—<i class="calibre8">i.e.</i> to obey intelligently, which is the real meaning of all discipline.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Again, people who are in charge often seem to have a pride in feeling that they will be "missed," that no one can understand or carry on their arrangements, their system, books, accounts, &amp;c., but themselves. It seems to me that the pride is rather in carrying on a system, in keeping stores, closets, books, accounts, &amp;c., so that any body can understand and carry them on—so that, in case of absence or illness, one can deliver every thing up to others and know that all will go on as usual, and that one shall never be missed.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Why hired nurses give so much trouble.</div>
<div class="blockquot">
<p class="calibre2"><span class="smcap">Note</span>.—It is often complained, that professional nurses, brought into private families, in case of sickness, make themselves intolerable by "ordering about" the other servants, under plea of not neglecting the patient. Both things are true; the patient is often neglected, and the servants are often unfairly "put upon." But the fault is generally in the want of management of the head in charge. It is surely for her to arrange both that the nurse's place is, when necessary, supplemented, and that the patient is never neglected—things with a little management quite compatible, and indeed only attainable together. It is certainly not for the nurse to "order about" the servants.</p>
</div>
<hr class="c1"/>
<div class="calibre6"></div><h2 id="pgepubid00034" class="calibre7"><a id="IV_NOISE" class="calibre9"></a>IV. NOISE.</h2>
<div class="sidenote">Unnecessary noise.</div>
<p class="calibre2">Unnecessary noise, or noise that creates an expectation in the mind, is that which hurts a patient. It is rarely the loudness of the noise, the effect upon the organ of the ear itself, which appears to affect the sick. How well a patient will generally bear, <i class="calibre8">e.g.</i>, the putting up of a scaffolding close to the house, when he cannot bear the talking, still less the whispering, especially if it be of a familiar voice, outside his door.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are certain patients, no doubt, especially where there is slight concussion or other disturbance of the brain, who are affected by mere noise. But intermittent noise, or sudden and sharp noise, in these as in all other cases, affects far more than continuous noise—noise with jar far more than noise without. Of one thing you may be certain, that anything which wakes a patient suddenly out of his sleep will invariably put him into a state of greater excitement, do him more serious, aye, and lasting mischief, than any continuous noise, however loud.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Never let a patient be waked out of his first sleep.</div>
<p class="calibre2">Never to allow a patient to be waked, intentionally or accidentally, is a <i class="calibre8">sine quâ non</i> of all good nursing. If he is roused out of his first sleep, he is almost certain to have no more sleep. It is a curious but quite intelligible fact that, if a patient is waked after a few hours' instead of a few minutes' sleep, he is much more likely to sleep again. Because pain, like irritability of brain, perpetuates and intensifies itself. If you have gained a respite of either in sleep <a id="Page_26"></a><a title="[Pg 26]" id="pgepubid00035"></a>you have gained more than the mere respite. Both the probability of recurrence and of the same intensity will be diminished; whereas both will be terribly increased by want of sleep. This is the reason why sleep is so all-important. This is the reason why a patient waked in the early part of his sleep loses not only his sleep, but his power to sleep. A healthy person who allows himself to sleep during the day will lose his sleep at night. But it is exactly the reverse with the sick generally; the more they sleep, the better will they be able to sleep.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Noise which excites expectation.</div>
<p class="calibre2">I have often been surprised at the thoughtlessness, (resulting in cruelty, quite unintentionally) of friends or of doctors who will hold a long conversation just in the room or passage adjoining to the room of the patient, who is either every moment expecting them to come in, or who has just seen them, and knows they are talking about him. If he is an amiable patient, he will try to occupy his attention elsewhere and not to listen—and this makes matters worse—for the strain upon his attention and the effort he makes are so great that it is well if he is not worse for hours after.<span class="sidenote1">Whispered conversation in the room</span> If it is a whispered conversation in the same room, then it is absolutely cruel; for it is impossible that the patient's attention should not be involuntarily strained to hear. Walking on tip-toe, doing any thing in the room very slowly, are injurious, for exactly the same reasons. A firm light quick step, a steady quick hand are the desiderata; not the slow, lingering, shuffling foot, the timid, uncertain touch. Slowness is not gentleness, though it is often mistaken for such; quickness, lightness, and gentleness are quite compatible. Again, if friends and doctors did but watch, as nurses can and should watch, the features sharpening, the eyes growing almost wild, of fever patients who are listening for the entrance from the corridor of the persons whose voices they are hearing there, these would never run the risk again of creating such expectation, or irritation of mind.—Such unnecessary noise has undoubtedly induced or aggravated delirium in many cases. I have known such—in one case death ensued. It is but fair to say that this death was attributed to fright. It was the result of a long whispered conversation, within sight of the patient, about an impending operation; but any one who has known the more than stoicism, the cheerful coolness, with which the certainty of an operation will be accepted by any patient, capable of bearing an operation at all, if it is properly communicated to him, will hesitate to believe that it was mere fear which produced, as was averred, the fatal result in this instance. It was rather the uncertainty, the strained expectation as to what was to be decided upon.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Or just outside the door.</div>
<p class="calibre2">I need hardly say that the other common cause, namely, for a doctor or friend to leave the patient and communicate his opinion on the result of his visit to the friends just outside the patient's door, or in the adjoining room, after the visit, but within hearing or knowledge of the patient is, if possible, worst of all.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Noise of female dress.</div>
<p class="calibre2">It is, I think, alarming, peculiarly at this time, when the female ink-bottles are perpetually impressing upon us "woman's" "parti<a id="Page_27"></a><a title="[Pg 27]" id="pgepubid00036"></a>cular worth and general missionariness," to see that the dress of women is daily more and more unfitting them for any "mission," or usefulness at all. It is equally unfitted for all poetic and all domestic purposes. A man is now a more handy and far less objectionable being in a sick-room than a woman. Compelled by her dress, every woman now either shuffles or waddles—only a man can cross the floor of a sick-room without shaking it! What is become of woman's light step?—the firm, light, quick step we have been asking for?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unnecessary noise, then, is the most cruel absence of care which can be inflicted either on sick or well. For, in all these remarks, the sick are only mentioned as suffering in a greater proportion than the well from precisely the same causes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unnecessary (although slight) noise injures a sick person much more than necessary noise (of a much greater amount).</p>
<div class="sidenote">Patient's repulsion to nurses who rustle.</div>
<p class="calibre2">All doctrines about mysterious affinities and aversions will be found to resolve themselves very much, if not entirely, into presence or absence of care in these things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A nurse who rustles (I am speaking of nurses professional and unprofessional) is the horror of a patient, though perhaps he does not know why.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The fidget of silk and of crinoline, the rattling of keys, the creaking of stays and of shoes, will do a patient more harm than all the medicines in the world will do him good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The noiseless step of woman, the noiseless drapery of woman, are mere figures of speech in this day. Her skirts (and well if they do not throw down some piece of furniture) will at least brush against every article in the room as she moves.<a id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a class="fnanchor" href="part0005.html#Footnote_15_15">[15]</a></p>
<p class="calibre2">Again, one nurse cannot open the door without making everything rattle. Or she opens the door unnecessarily often, for want of remembering all the articles that might be brought in at once.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A good nurse will always make sure that no door or window in her patient's room shall rattle or creak; that no blind or curtain shall, by any change of wind through the open window, be made to flap—especially will she be careful of all this before she leaves her patients for the night. If you wait till your patients tell you, or remind you of these things, where is the use of their having a nurse? There are more shy than exacting patients, in all classes; and many <a id="Page_28"></a><a title="[Pg 28]" id="pgepubid00037"></a>a patient passes a bad night, time after time, rather than remind his nurse every night of all the things she has forgotten.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If there are blinds to your windows, always take care to have them well up, when they are not being used. A little piece slipping down, and flapping with every draught, will distract a patient.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Hurry peculiarly hurtful to sick.</div>
<p class="calibre2">All hurry or bustle is peculiarly painful to the sick. And when a patient has compulsory occupations to engage him, instead of having simply to amuse himself, it becomes doubly injurious. The friend who remains standing and fidgetting about while a patient is talking business to him, or the friend who sits and proses, the one from an idea of not letting the patient talk, the other from an idea of amusing him,—each is equally inconsiderate. Always sit down when a sick person is talking business to you, show no signs of hurry, give complete attention and full consideration if your advice is wanted, and go away the moment the subject is ended.</p>
<div class="sidenote">How to visit the sick and not hurt them.</div>
<p class="calibre2">Always sit within the patient's view, so that when you speak to him he has not painfully to turn his head round in order to look at you. Everybody involuntarily looks at the person speaking. If you make this act a wearisome one on the part of the patient you are doing him harm. So also if by continuing to stand you make him continuously raise his eyes to see you. Be as motionless as possible, and never gesticulate in speaking to the sick.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Never make a patient repeat a message or request, especially if it be some time after. Occupied patients are often accused of doing too much of their own business. They are instinctively right. How often you hear the person, charged with the request of giving the message or writing the letter, say half an hour afterwards to the patient, "Did you appoint 12 o'clock?" or, "What did you say was the address?" or ask perhaps some much more agitating question—thus causing the patient the effort of memory, or worse still, of decision, all over again. It is really less exertion to him to write his letters himself. This is the almost universal experience of occupied invalids.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This brings us to another caution. Never speak to an invalid from behind, nor from the door, nor from any distance from him, nor when he is doing anything.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The official politeness of servants in these things is so grateful to invalids, that many prefer, without knowing why, having none but servants about them.</p>
<div class="sidenote">These things not fancy.</div>
<p class="calibre2">These things are not fancy. If we consider that, with sick as with well, every thought decomposes some nervous matter,—that decomposition as well as re-composition of nervous matter is always going on, and more quickly with the sick than with the well,—that, to obtrude abruptly another thought upon the brain while it is in the act of destroying nervous matter by thinking, is calling upon it to make a new exertion,—if we consider these things, which are facts, not fancies, we shall remember that we are doing positive injury by interrupting, by "startling a fanciful" person, as it is called. Alas! it is no fancy.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Interruption damaging to sick.</div>
<p class="calibre2">If the invalid is forced, by his avocations, to continue occupations <a id="Page_29"></a><a title="[Pg 29]" id="pgepubid00038"></a>requiring much thinking, the injury is doubly great. In feeding a patient suffering under delirium or stupor you may suffocate him, by giving him his food suddenly, but if you rub his lips gently with a spoon and thus attract his attention, he will swallow the food unconsciously, but with perfect safety. Thus it is with the brain. If you offer it a thought, especially one requiring a decision, abruptly, you do it a real not fanciful injury. Never speak to a sick person suddenly; but, at the same time, do not keep his expectation on the tiptoe.</p>
<div class="sidenote">And to well.</div>
<p class="calibre2">This rule, indeed, applies to the well quite as much as to the sick. I have never known persons who exposed themselves for years to constant interruption who did not muddle away their intellects by it at last. The process with them may be accomplished without pain. With the sick, pain gives warning of the injury.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Keeping a patient standing.</div>
<p class="calibre2">Do not meet or overtake a patient who is moving about in order to speak to him, or to give him any message or letter. You might just as well give him a box on the ear. I have seen a patient fall flat on the ground who was standing when his nurse came into the room. This was an accident which might have happened to the most careful nurse. But the other is done with intention. A patient in such a state is not going to the East Indies. If you would wait ten seconds, or walk ten yards further, any promenade he could make would be over. You do not know the effort it is to a patient to remain standing for even a quarter of a minute to listen to you. If I had not seen the thing done by the kindest nurses and friends, I should have thought this caution quite superfluous.<a id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a class="fnanchor" href="part0005.html#Footnote_16_16">[16]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">Patients dread surprise.</div>
<p class="calibre2">Patients are often accused of being able to "do much more when nobody is by." It is quite true that they can. Unless nurses can be brought to attend to considerations of the kind of which we have given here but a few specimens, a very weak patient finds it really much less exertion to do things for himself than to ask for them. And he will, in order to do them, (very innocently and from instinct) calculate the time his nurse is likely to be absent, from a fear of her "coming in upon" him or speaking to him, just at the moment when he finds it quite as much as he can do to crawl from his bed to his chair, or from one room to another, or down stairs, or out of doors for a few minutes. Some extra call made upon his attention at that moment will quite upset him. In these cases you may be sure that a patient in the state we have described does not make such exertions more than once or twice a-day, and probably <a id="Page_30"></a><a title="[Pg 30]" id="pgepubid00039"></a>much about the same hour every day. And it is hard, indeed, if nurse and friends cannot calculate so as to let him make them undisturbed. Remember, that many patients can walk who cannot stand or even sit up. Standing is, of all positions, the most trying to a weak patient.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everything you do in a patient's room, after he is "put up" for the night, increases tenfold the risk of his having a bad night. But, if you rouse him up after he has fallen asleep, you do not risk, you secure him a bad night.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One hint I would give to all who attend or visit the sick, to all who have to pronounce an opinion upon sickness or its progress. Come back and look at your patient <i class="calibre8">after</i> he has had an hour's animated conversation with you. It is the best test of his real state we know. But never pronounce upon him from merely seeing what he does, or how he looks, during such a conversation. Learn also carefully and exactly, if you can, how he passed the night after it.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Effects of over-exertion on sick.</div>
<p class="calibre2">People rarely, if ever, faint while making an exertion. It is after it is over. Indeed, almost every effect of over-exertion appears after, not during such exertion. It is the highest folly to judge of the sick, as is so often done, when you see them merely during a period of excitement. People have very often died of that which, it has been proclaimed at the time, has "done them no harm."<a id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a class="fnanchor" href="part0005.html#Footnote_17_17">[17]</a></p>
<p class="calibre2">Remember never to lean against, sit upon, or unnecessarily shake, or even touch the bed in which a patient lies. This is invariably a painful annoyance. If you shake the chair on which he sits, he has a point by which to steady himself, in his feet. But on a bed or sofa, he is entirely at your mercy, and he feels every jar you give him all through him.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Difference between real and fancy patients.</div>
<p class="calibre2">In all that we have said, both here and elsewhere, let it be distinctly understood that we are not speaking of hypochondriacs. To distinguish between real and fancied disease forms an important branch of the education of a nurse. To manage fancy patients forms an important branch of her duties. But the nursing which real and that which fancied patients require is of different, or rather of opposite, character. And the latter will not be spoken of here. Indeed, many of the symptoms which are here mentioned are those which distinguish real from fancied disease.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a id="Page_31"></a><a title="[Pg 31]" id="pgepubid00040"></a></p>
<p class="calibre2">It is true that hypochondriacs very often do that behind a nurse's back which they would not do before her face. Many such I have had as patients who scarcely ate anything at their regular meals; but if you concealed food for them in a drawer, they would take it at night or in secret. But this is from quite a different motive. They do it from the wish to conceal. Whereas the real patient will often boast to his nurse or doctor, if these do not shake their heads at him, of how much he has done, or eaten, or walked. To return to real disease.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Conciseness necessary with Sick.</div>
<p class="calibre2">Conciseness and decision are, above all things, necessary with the sick. Let your thought expressed to them be concisely and decidedly expressed. What doubt and hesitation there may be in your own mind must never be communicated to theirs, not even (I would rather say especially not) in little things. Let your doubt be to yourself, your decision to them. People who think outside their heads, the whole process of whose thought appears, like Homer's, in the act of secretion, who tell everything that led them towards this conclusion and away from that, ought never to be with the sick.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Irresolution most painful to them.</div>
<p class="calibre2">Irresolution is what all patients most dread. Rather than meet this in others, they will collect all their data, and make up their minds for themselves. A change of mind in others, whether it is regarding an operation, or re-writing a letter, always injures the patient more than the being called upon to make up his mind to the most dreaded or difficult decision. Farther than this, in very many cases, the imagination in disease is far more active and vivid than it is in health. If you propose to the patient change of air to one place one hour, and to another the next, he has, in each case, immediately constituted himself in imagination the tenant of the place, gone over the whole premises in idea, and you have tired him as much by displacing his imagination, as if you had actually carried him over both places.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Above all leave the sick room quickly and come into it quickly, not suddenly, not with a rush. But don't let the patient be wearily waiting for when you will be out of the room or when you will be in it. Conciseness and decision in your movements, as well as your words, are necessary in the sick room, as necessary as absence of hurry and bustle. To possess yourself entirely will ensure you from either failing—either loitering or hurrying.</p>
<div class="sidenote">What a patient must not have to see to.</div>
<p class="calibre2">If a patient has to see, not only to his own but also to his nurse's punctuality, or perseverance, or readiness, or calmness, to any or all of these things, he is far better without that nurse than with her—however valuable and handy her services may otherwise be to him, and however incapable he may be of rendering them to himself.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Reading aloud.</div>
<p class="calibre2">With regard to reading aloud in the sick room, my experience is, that when the sick are too ill to read to themselves, they can seldom bear to be read to. Children, eye-patients, and uneducated persons are exceptions, or where there is any mechanical difficulty in reading. People who like to be read to, have generally not much the matter with them; while in fevers, or where there is much irritability of brain, the effort of listening to reading aloud has often <a id="Page_32"></a><a title="[Pg 32]" id="pgepubid00041"></a>brought on delirium. I speak with great diffidence; because there is an almost universal impression that it is <i class="calibre8">sparing</i> the sick to read aloud to them. But two things are certain:—</p>
<div class="sidenote">Read aloud slowly, distinctly, and steadily to the sick.</div>
<p class="calibre2">(1.) If there is some matter which <i class="calibre8">must</i> be read to a sick person, do it slowly. People often think that the way to get it over with least fatigue to him is to get it over in least time. They gabble; they plunge and gallop through the reading. There never was a greater mistake. Houdin, the conjuror, says that the way to make a story seem short is to tell it slowly. So it is with reading to the sick. I have often heard a patient say to such a mistaken reader, "Don't read it to me; tell it me."<a id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a class="fnanchor" href="part0005.html#Footnote_18_18">[18]</a> Unconsciously he is aware that this will regulate the plunging, the reading with unequal paces, slurring over one part, instead of leaving it out altogether, if it is unimportant, and mumbling another. If the reader lets his own attention wander, and then stops to read up to himself, or finds he has read the wrong bit, then it is all over with the poor patient's chance of not suffering. Very few people know how to read to the sick; very few read aloud as pleasantly even as they speak. In reading they sing, they hesitate, they stammer, they hurry, they mumble; when in speaking they do none of these things. Reading aloud to the sick ought always to be rather slow, and exceedingly distinct, but not mouthing—rather monotonous, but not sing song—rather loud, but not noisy—and, above all, not too long. Be very sure of what your patient can bear.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Never read aloud by fits and starts to the sick.</div>
<p class="calibre2">(2.) The extraordinary habit of reading to oneself in a sick room, and reading aloud to the patient any bits which will amuse him or more often the reader, is unaccountably thoughtless. What <i class="calibre8">do</i> you think the patient is thinking of during your gaps of non-reading? Do you think that he amuses himself upon what you have read for precisely the time it pleases you to go on reading to yourself, and that his attention is ready for something else at precisely the time it pleases you to begin reading again? Whether the person thus read to be sick or well, whether he be doing nothing or doing something else while being thus read to, the self-absorption and want of observation of the person who does it, is equally difficult to understand—although very often the read<i class="calibre8">ee</i> is too amiable to say how much it disturbs him.</p>
<div class="sidenote">People overhead.</div>
<p class="calibre2">One thing more:—From the flimsy manner in which most modern houses are built, where every step on the stairs, and along the floors, is felt all over the house; the higher the story, the greater the vibration. It is inconceivable how much the sick suffer by having anybody overhead. In the solidly built old houses, which, fortunately, most hospitals are, the noise and shaking is comparatively trifling. But it is a serious cause of suffering, in lightly built houses, and with the irritability peculiar to some diseases. Better far put such patients at the top of the house, even with the additional fatigue of stairs, if you cannot secure the room above them being <a id="Page_33"></a><a title="[Pg 33]" id="pgepubid00042"></a>untenanted; you may otherwise bring on a state of restlessness which no opium will subdue. Do not neglect the warning, when a patient tells you that he "Feels every step above him to cross his heart." Remember that every noise a patient cannot <i class="calibre8">see</i> partakes of the character of suddenness to him; and I am persuaded that patients with these peculiarly irritable nerves, are positively less injured by having persons in the same room with them than overhead, or separated by only a thin compartment. Any sacrifice to secure silence for these cases is worth while, because no air, however good, no attendance, however careful, will do anything for such cases without quiet.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Music.</div>
<div class="blockquot">
<p class="calibre2"><span class="smcap">Note</span>.—The effect of music upon the sick has been scarcely at all noticed. In fact, its expensiveness, as it is now, makes any general application of it quite out of the question. I will only remark here, that wind instruments, including the human voice, and stringed instruments, capable of continuous sound, have generally a beneficent effect—while the piano-forte, with such instruments as have <i class="calibre8">no</i> continuity of sound, has just the reverse. The finest piano-forte playing will damage the sick, while an air, like "Home, sweet home," or "Assisa a piè d'un salice," on the most ordinary grinding organ will sensibly soothe them—and this quite independent of association.</p>

<div class="calibre6"></div><h2 id="pgepubid00043" class="calibre7"><a id="V_VARIETY" class="calibre9"></a>V. VARIETY.</h2>
<div class="sidenote">Variety a means of recovery.</div>
<p class="calibre2">To any but an old nurse, or an old patient, the degree would be quite inconceivable to which the nerves of the sick suffer from seeing the same walls, the same ceiling, the same surroundings during a long confinement to one or two rooms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The superior cheerfulness of persons suffering severe paroxysms of pain over that of persons suffering from nervous debility has often been remarked upon, and attributed to the enjoyment of the former of their intervals of respite. I incline to think that the majority of cheerful cases is to be found among those patients who are not confined to one room, whatever their suffering, and that the majority of depressed cases will be seen among those subjected to a long monotony of objects about them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The nervous frame really suffers as much from this as the digestive organs from long monotony of diet, as <i class="calibre8">e.g.</i> the soldier from his twenty-one years' "boiled beef."</p>
