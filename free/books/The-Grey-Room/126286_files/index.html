<p class="calibre1">The	piers	of	the	main	entrance	of	Chadlands	were	of	red	brick,	and	upon	each</p>
<p class="calibre1">reposed	a	mighty	sphere	of	grey	granite.	Behind	them	stretched	away	the	park, </p>
<p class="calibre1">where	 forest	 trees,	 nearly	 shorn	 of	 their	 leaves	 at	 the	 edge	 of	 winter,	 still answered	the	setting	sun	with	fires	of	thinning	foliage.	They	sank	away	through</p>
<p class="calibre1">stretches	 of	 brake	 fern,	 and	 already	 amid	 their	 trunks	 arose	 a	 thin,	 blue	 haze—</p>
<p class="calibre1">breath	of	earth	made	visible	by	coming	cold.	There	was	frost	in	the	air,	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sickle	 of	 a	 new	 moon	 hung	 where	 dusk	 of	 evening	 dimmed	 the	 green	 of	 the western	sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guns	were	returning,	and	eight	men	with	three	women	arrived	at	the	lofty</p>
<p class="calibre1">gates.	One	of	the	party	rode	a	grey	pony,	and	a	woman	walked	on	each	side	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">him.	They	chattered	together,	and	the	little	company	of	tweed-clad	people	passed</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	 Chadlands	 Park	 and	 trudged	 forward,	 where	 the	 manor	 house	 rose	 half	 a mile	ahead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	an	old	man	emerged	from	a	lodge,	hidden	behind	a	grove	of	laurel	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">bay	within	the	entrance,	and	shut	the	great	gates	of	scroll	iron.	They	were	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">flamboyant	Italian	period,	and	more	arrestive	than	distinguished.	Panelled	upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">them,	and	belonging	to	a	later	day	than	they,	had	been	imposed	two	iron	coats	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">arms,	with	crest	above	and	motto	beneath—the	heraldic	bearings	of	the	present</p>
<p class="calibre1">owner	of	Chadlands.	He	set	store	upon	such	things,	but	was	not	responsible	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	work.	A	survival	himself,	and	steeped	in	ancient	opinions,	his	coat,	won	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">forgotten	age,	interested	him	only	less	than	his	Mutiny	medal—his	sole	personal</p>
<p class="calibre1">claim	 to	 public	 honor.	 He	 had	 served	 in	 youth	 as	 a	 soldier,	 but	 was	 still	 a subaltern	when	his	father	died	and	he	came	into	his	kingdom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now,	 Sir	 Walter	 Lennox,	 fifth	 baronet,	 had	 grown	 old,	 and	 his	 invincible</p>
<p class="calibre1">kindness	 of	 heart,	 his	 archaic	 principles,	 his	 great	 wealth,	 and	 the	 limited experiences	of	reality,	for	which	such	wealth	was	responsible,	left	him	a	popular</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	respected	man.	Yet	he	aroused	much	exasperation	in	local	landowners	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 generosity	 and	 scorn	 of	 all	 economic	 principles;	 and	 while	 his	 tenants	 held him	 the	 very	 exemplar	 of	 a	 landlord,	 and	 his	 servants	 worshipped	 him	 for	 the best	possible	reasons,	his	friends,	weary	of	remonstrance,	were	forced	to	forgive</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 bad	 precedents	 and	 a	 mistaken	 liberality	 quite	 beyond	 the	 power	 of	 the average	 unfortunate	 who	 lives	 by	 his	 land.	 But	 he	 managed	 his	 great	 manor	 in his	 own	 lavish	 way,	 and	 marvelled	 that	 other	 men	 declared	 difficulties	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a>problems	 he	 so	 readily	 solved.	 That	 night,	 after	 a	 little	 music,	 the	 Chadlands' </p>
<p class="calibre1">house	party	drifted	to	the	billiard-room,	and	while	most	of	the	men,	after	a	heavy</p>
<p class="calibre1">day	far	afield,	were	content	to	lounge	by	a	great	open	hearth	where	a	wood	fire</p>
<p class="calibre1">burned,	Sir	Walter,	who	had	been	on	a	pony	most	of	the	time,	declared	himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">unwearied,	and	demanded	a	game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No	excuses,	Henry,"	he	said;	and	turned	to	a	young	man	lounging	in	an	easy-chair	outside	the	fireside	circle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	youth	started.	His	eyes	had	been	fixed	on	a	woman	sitting	beside	the	fire, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 her	 hand	 in	 a	 man's.	 It	 was	 such	 an	 attitude	 as	 sophisticated	 lovers	 would only	assume	in	private	but	the	pair	were	not	sophisticated	and	lovers	still,	though</p>
<p class="calibre1">married.	They	lacked	self-consciousness,	and	the	husband	liked	to	feel	his	wife's</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand	 in	 his.	 After	 all,	 a	 thing	 impossible	 until	 you	 are	 married	 may	 be	 quite seemly	afterwards,	and	none	of	their	amiable	elders	regarded	their	devotion	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">cynicism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	right,	uncle!"	said	Henry	Lennox. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 rose—a	 big	 fellow	 with	 heavy	 shoulders,	 a	 clean-shaven,	 youthful	 face, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 flaxen	 hair.	 He	 had	 been	 handsome,	 save	 for	 a	 nose	 with	 a	 broken	 bridge, but	his	pale	brown	eyes	were	fine,	and	his	firm	mouth	and	chin	well	modelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imagination	and	reflection	marked	his	countenance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter	claimed	thirty	points	on	his	scoring	board,	and	gave	a	miss	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">spot	ball. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	win	to-night,"	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 was	 a	 small,	 very	 upright	 man,	 with	 a	 face	 that	 seemed	 to	 belong	 to	 his generation,	and	an	expression	seldom	to	be	seen	on	a	man	younger	than	seventy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Life	had	not	puzzled	him;	his	moderate	intellect	had	taken	it	as	he	found	it,	and, </p>
<p class="calibre1">through	the	magic	glasses	of	good	health,	good	temper,	and	great	wealth,	judged</p>
<p class="calibre1">existence	a	desirable	thing	and	quite	easy	to	conduct	with	credit.	"You	only	want patience	and	a	brain,"	he	always	declared.	Sir	Walter	wore	an	eyeglass.	He	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">growing	bald,	but	preserved	a	pair	of	grey	whiskers	still	of	respectable	size.	His</p>
<p class="calibre1">face,	indeed,	belied	him,	for	it	was	moulded	in	a	stern	pattern.	One	had	guessed</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	 a	 martinet	 until	 his	 amiable	 opinions	 and	 easy-going	 personality	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">manifested.	The	old	man	was	not	vain;	he	knew	that	a	world	very	different	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 own	 extended	 round	 about	 him.	 But	 he	 was	 puzzle-headed,	 and	 had	 never been	 shaken	 from	 his	 life-long	 complacency	 by	 circumstances.	 He	 had	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappointed	 in	 love	 as	 a	 young	 man,	 and	 only	 married	 late	 in	 life.	 He	 had	 no son,	and	was	a	widower—facts	that,	to	his	mind,	quite	dwarfed	his	good	fortune</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 every	 other	 respect.	 He	 held	 the	 comfortable	 doctrine	 that	 things	 are	 always</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>levelled	 up,	 and	 he	 honestly	 believed	 that	 he	 had	 suffered	 as	 much	 sorrow	 and disappointment	as	any	Lennox	in	the	history	of	the	race. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 only	 child	 and	 her	 cousin,	 Henry	 Lennox,	 had	 been	 brought	 up	 together and	 were	 of	 an	 age—both	 now	 twenty-six.	 The	 lad	 was	 his	 uncle's	 heir,	 and would	succeed	to	Chadlands	and	the	title;	and	it	had	been	Sir	Walter's	hope	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 and	 Mary	 might	 marry.	 Nor	 had	 the	 youth	 any	 objection	 to	 such	 a	 plan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed,	 he	 loved	 Mary	 well	 enough;	 there	 was	 even	 thought	 to	 be	 a	 tacit understanding	between	them,	and	they	grew	up	in	a	friendship	which	gradually</p>
<p class="calibre1">became	 ardent	 on	 the	 man's	 part,	 though	 it	 never	 ripened	 upon	 hers.	 But	 she knew	 that	 her	 father	 keenly	 desired	 this	 marriage,	 and	 supposed	 that	 it	 would happen	some	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 were,	 however,	 not	 betrothed	 when	 the	 war	 burst	 upon	 Europe,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry,	then	one-and-twenty,	went	from	the	Officers'	Training	Corps	to	the	Fifth</p>
<p class="calibre1">Devons,	 while	 his	 cousin	 became	 attached	 to	 the	 Red	 Cross	 and	 nursed	 at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Plymouth.	The	accident	terminated	their	shadowy	romance	and	brought	real	love</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	the	woman's	life,	while	the	man	found	his	hopes	at	an	end.	He	was	drafted</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 Mesopotamia,	 speedily	 fell	 sick	 of	 jaundice,	 was	 invalided	 to	 India,	 and,	 on returning	 to	 the	 front,	 saw	 service	 against	 the	 Turks.	 But	 chance	 willed	 that	 he won	 no	 distinction.	 He	 did	 his	 duty	 under	 dreary	 circumstances,	 while	 to	 his hatred	 of	 war	 was	 added	 the	 weight	 of	 his	 loss	 when	 he	 heard	 that	 Mary	 had fallen	in	love.	He	was	an	ingenuous,	kindly	youth—a	typical	Lennox,	who	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">developed	an	accomplishment	at	Harrow	and	suffered	for	it	by	getting	his	nose</p>
<p class="calibre1">broken	 when	 winning	 the	 heavy-weight	 championship	 of	 the	 public	 schools	 in his	nineteenth	year.	In	the	East	he	still	boxed,	and	after	his	love	story	was	ended, the	 epidemic	 of	 poetry-making	 took	 Henry	 also,	 and	 he	 wrote	 a	 volume	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">harmless	verse,	to	the	undying	amazement	of	his	family. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	Mary	Lennox	the	war	had	brought	a	sailor	husband.	Captain	Thomas	May, </p>
<p class="calibre1">wounded	 rather	 severely	 at	 Jutland,	 lost	 his	 heart	 to	 the	 plain	 but	 attractive young	 woman	 with	 a	 fine	 figure	 who	 nursed	 him	 back	 to	 strength,	 and,	 as	 he vowed,	 had	 saved	 his	 life.	 He	 was	 an	 impulsive	 man	 of	 thirty,	 brown-bearded, black-eyed,	and	hot-tempered.	He	came	from	a	little	Somerset	vicarage	and	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 only	 son	 of	 a	 clergyman,	 the	 Rev.	 Septimus	 May.	 Knowing	 the	 lady	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nurse	Mary"	only,	and	falling	passionately	in	love	for	the	first	time	in	his	life, he	proposed	on	the	day	he	was	allowed	to	sit	up,	and	since	Mary	Lennox	shared</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 emotions,	 also	 for	 the	 first	 time,	 he	 was	 accepted	 before	 he	 even	 knew	 her name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 is	 impossible	 to	 describe	 the	 force	 of	 love's	 advent	 for	 Mary	 Lennox.	 She had	 come	 to	 believe	 herself	 as	 vaguely	 committed	 to	 her	 cousin,	 and	 imagined</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>that	her	affection	for	Henry	amounted	to	as	much	as	she	was	ever	likely	to	feel for	a	man.	But	reality	awakened	her,	and	its	glory	did	not	make	her	selfish,	since</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	nature	was	not	constructed	so	to	be;	it	only	taught	her	what	love	meant,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">convinced	 her	 that	 she	 could	 never	 marry	 anybody	 on	 earth	 but	 the	 stricken sailor.	And	this	she	knew	long	before	he	was	well	enough	to	give	a	sign	that	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">even	appreciated	her	ministry.	The	very	whisper	of	his	voice	sent	a	thrill	through</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	before	he	had	gained	strength	to	speak	aloud.	And	his	deep	tones,	when	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">heard	them,	were	like	no	voice	that	had	fallen	on	her	ear	till	then.	The	first	thing that	indicated	restoring	health	was	his	request	that	his	beard	might	be	trimmed; </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 he	 was	 making	 love	 to	 her	 three	 days	 after	 he	 had	 been	 declared	 out	 of danger.	 Then	 did	 Mary	 begin	 to	 live,	 and	 looking	 back,	 she	 marvelled	 how horses	 and	 dogs	 and	 a	 fishing-rod	 had	 been	 her	 life	 till	 now.	 The	 revelation bewildered	 her	 and	 she	 wrote	 her	 emotions	 in	 many	 long	 pages	 to	 her	 cousin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	causes	of	such	changes	she	did	not	indeed	specify,	but	he	read	between	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lines,	and	knew	it	was	a	man	and	not	the	war	that	had	so	altered	and	deepened</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	outlook.	He	had	never	done	it,	and	he	could	not	be	angry	with	her	now,	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	had	pretended	no	ardor	of	emotion	to	him.	Young	though	he	was,	he	always</p>
<p class="calibre1">feared	that	she	liked	him	not	after	the	way	of	a	lover.	He	had	hoped	to	open	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes	some	day,	but	it	was	given	to	another	to	do	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 felt	 no	 surprise,	 therefore,	 when	 news	 of	 her	 engagement	 reached	 him</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	herself.	He	wrote	the	letter	of	his	life	in	reply,	and	was	at	pains	to	laugh	at their	 boy-and-girl	 attachment,	 and	 lessen	 any	 regret	 she	 might	 feel	 on	 his account.	Her	father	took	it	somewhat	hardly	at	first,	for	he	held	that	more	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">sufficient	 misfortunes,	 to	 correct	 the	 balance	 of	 prosperity	 in	 his	 favor,	 had already	 befallen	 him.	 But	 he	 was	 deeply	 attached	 to	 his	 daughter,	 and	 her magical	change	under	the	new	and	radiant	revelation	convinced	him	that	she	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	awakened	to	an	emotional	fulness	of	life	which	could	only	be	the	outward</p>
<p class="calibre1">sign	 of	 love.	 That	 she	 was	 in	 love	 for	 the	 first	 time	 also	 seemed	 clear;	 but	 he would	not	give	his	consent	until	he	had	seen	her	lover	and	heard	all	there	was	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">know	 about	 him.	 That,	 however,	 did	 not	 alarm	 Mary,	 for	 she	 believed	 that Thomas	 May	 must	 prove	 a	 spirit	 after	 Sir	 Walter's	 heart.	 And	 so	 he	 did.	 The sailor	was	a	gentleman;	he	had	proposed	without	the	faintest	notion	to	whom	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">offered	 his	 penniless	 hand,	 and	 when	 he	 did	 find	 out,	 was	 so	 bewildered	 that Mary	assured	her	father	she	thought	he	would	change	his	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	I	had	not	threatened	him	with	disgrace	and	breach	of	promise,	I	do	think	he would	have	thrown	me	over,"	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	now	they	had	been	wedded	for	six	months,	and	Mary	sat	by	the	great	log</p>
<p class="calibre1">fire	with	her	hand	in	Tom's.	The	sailor	was	on	leave,	but	expected	to	return	to	his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>ship	 at	 Plymouth	 in	 a	 day	 or	 two.	 Then	 his	 father-in-law	 had	 promised	 to	 visit the	great	cruiser,	for	the	Navy	was	a	service	of	which	he	knew	little.	Lennoxes</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	all	been	soldiers	or	clergymen	since	a	great	lawyer	founded	the	race. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 game	 of	 billiards	 proceeded,	 and	 Henry	 caught	 his	 uncle	 in	 the	 eighties and	 ran	 out	 with	 an	 unfinished	 fifteen.	 Then	 Ernest	 Travers	 and	 his	 wife—old and	dear	friends	of	Sir	Walter—played	a	hundred	up,	the	lady	receiving	half	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">game.	 Mr.	 Travers	 was	 a	 Suffolk	 man,	 and	 had	 fagged	 for	 Sir	 Walter	 at	 Eton. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	comradeship	had	 lasted	a	lifetime,	 and	no	year	 passed	without	reciprocal</p>
<p class="calibre1">visits.	Travers	also	looked	at	life	with	the	eyes	of	a	wealthy	man.	He	was	sixty-</p>
<p class="calibre1">five,	 pompous,	 large,	 and	 rubicund—a	 "backwoodsman"	 of	 a	 pattern</p>
<p class="calibre1">obsolescent.	 His	 wife,	 ten	 years	 younger	 than	 himself,	 loved	 pleasure,	 but	 she had	 done	 more	 than	 her	 duty,	 in	 her	 opinion,	 and	 borne	 him	 two	 sons	 and	 a daughter.	 They	 were	 colorless,	 kind-hearted	 people	 who	 lived	 in	 a	 circle	 of others	like	themselves.	The	war	had	sobered	them,	and	at	an	early	stage	robbed</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	of	their	younger	boy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nelly	Travers	won	her	game	amid	congratulations,	and	Tom	May	challenged</p>
<p class="calibre1">another	woman,	a	Diana,	who	lived	for	sport	and	had	joined	the	house	party	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	uncle,	Mr.	Felix	Fayre-Michell.	But	Millicent	Fayre-Michell	refused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've	shot	six	partridges,	a	hare,	and	two	pheasants	to-day,"	said	the	girl,	"and I'm	half	asleep." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Other	 men	 were	 present	 also	 of	 a	 type	 not	 dissimilar.	 It	 was	 a	 conventional gathering	of	rich	nobodies,	each	a	big	frog	in	his	own	little	puddle,	none	known</p>
<p class="calibre1">far	beyond	it	and	none	with	sufficient	intellect	or	ability	to	create	for	himself	any position	 in	 the	 world	 save	 that	 won	 by	 the	 accident	 of	 money	 made	 by	 their progenitors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had	 it	 been	 necessary	 for	 any	 of	 them	 to	 earn	 his	 living,	 only	 in	 some	 very modest	 capacity	 and	 on	 a	 very	 modest	 plane	 might	 they	 have	 done	 so.	 Of	 the entire	 company	 only	 one—the	 youngest—could	 claim	 even	 the	 celebrity	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">attached	to	his	little	volume	of	war	verses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 now	 upon	 the	 lives	 of	 these	 every-day	 folk	 was	 destined	 to	 break	 an event	unique	and	extraordinary.	Existence,	that	had	meandered	without	personal</p>
<p class="calibre1">incident	save	of	a	description	common	to	them	all,	was,	within	twelve	hours,	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">confront	 men	 and	 women	 alike	 with	 reality.	 They	 were	 destined	 to	 endure	 at close	 quarters	 an	 occurrence	 so	 astounding	 and	 unparalleled	 that,	 for	 once	 in their	 lives,	 they	 would	 find	 themselves	 interesting	 to	 the	 wider	 world	 beyond their	own	limited	circuit,	and,	for	their	friends	and	acquaintance,	the	centre	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">nine	days'	wonder. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>Most	 of	 them,	 indeed,	 merely	 touched	 the	 hem	 of	 the	 mystery	 and	 were	 not involved	 therein,	 but	 even	 for	 them	 a	 reflected	 glory	 shone.	 They	 were	 at	 least objects	of	attraction	elsewhere,	and	for	many	months	furnished	conversation	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	 interesting	 and	 exciting	 character	 than	 any	 could	 ever	 claim	 to	 have provided	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	attitude	to	such	an	event,	and	the	opinions	concerning	it,	of	such	people</p>
<p class="calibre1">might	have	been	pretty	accurately	predicted;	nor	would	it	be	fair	to	laugh	at	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">terror	and	bewilderment,	their	confusion	of	tongues	and	the	fatuous	theories	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">adventured	by	way	of	explanation.	For	wiser	than	they—men	experienced	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">problems	 of	 humanity	 and	 trained	 to	 solve	 its	 enigmas—were	 presently	 in	 no better	case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 very	 trivial	 and	 innocent	 remark	 was	 prelude	 to	 the	 disaster;	 and	 had	 the speaker	 guessed	 what	 his	 jest	 must	 presently	 mean	 in	 terms	 of	 human	 misery, grief,	and	horror,	it	is	certain	enough	that	he	would	not	have	spoken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 women	 were	 gone	 to	 bed	 and	 the	 men	 sat	 around	 the	 fire	 smoking	 and admiring	 Sir	 Walter's	 ancient	 blend	 of	 whisky.	 He	 himself	 had	 just	 flung	 away the	stump	of	his	cigar	and	was	admonishing	his	son-in-law.	"Church	to-morrow, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom.	None	of	your	larks.	When	first	you	came	to	see	me,	remember,	you	went	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">church	twice	on	Sunday	like	a	lamb.	I'll	have	no	backsliding." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mary	will	see	to	that,	governor." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	you,	Henry." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter,	disappointed	of	his	hopes	respecting	his	nephew	and	daughter,	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">none	the	less	treated	the	young	man	with	tact	and	tenderness.	He	felt	for	Henry; </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 was	 also	 fond	 of	 him	 and	 doubted	 not	 that	 the	 youth	 would	 prove	 a	 worthy successor.	Thomas	May	was	one	with	whom	none	could	quarrel,	and	he	and	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">wife's	old	flame	were	now,	after	the	acquaintance	of	a	week,	on	friendly	terms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	shan't	fail,	uncle." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Will	anybody	have	another	whisky?"	asked	Sir	Walter,	rising. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 the	 signal	 for	 departure	 and	 invariably	 followed	 the	 stroke	 of	 a	 deep-mouthed,	 grandfather	 clock	 in	 the	 hall.	 When	 eleven	 sounded,	 the	 master	 rose; but	to-night	he	was	delayed.	Tom	May	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fayre-Michell	has	never	heard	the	ghost	story,	governor,"	he	said,	"and	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Travers	 badly	 wants	 another	 drink.	 If	 he	 doesn't	 have	 one,	 he	 won't	 sleep	 all night.	He's	done	ten	men's	work	to-day." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Fayre-Michell	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 didn't	 know	 you	 had	 a	 ghost,	 Sir	 Walter.	 I'm	 tremendously	 interested	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>psychical	research	and	so	on.	If	it's	not	bothering	you	and	keeping	you	up—." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	ghost	at	Chadlands,	Walter?"	asked	Ernest	Travers.	"You	never	told	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ghosts	 are	 all	 humbug,"	 declared	 another	 speaker—a	 youthful	 "colonel"	 of the	war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	deprecate	that	attitude,	Vane.	It	may	certainly	be	that	our	ghost	is	a	humbug, or,	 rather,	 that	 we	 have	 no	 such	 thing	 as	 a	 ghost	 at	 all.	 And	 that	 is	 my	 own impression.	 But	 an	 idle	 generality	 is	 always	 futile—indeed,	 any	 generality</p>
<p class="calibre1">usually	is.	You	have,	at	least,	no	right	to	say,	'Ghosts	are	all	humbug.'	Because</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	 cannot	 prove	 they	 are.	 The	 weight	 of	 evidence	 is	 very	 much	 on	 the	 other side." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sorry,"	said	Colonel	Vane,	a	man	without	pride.	"I	didn't	know	you	believed in	'em,	Sir	Walter." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Most	emphatically	I	believe	in	them." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	 do	 I,"	 declared	 Ernest	 Travers.	 "Nay,	 so	 does	 my	 wife—for	 the	 best possible	reason.	A	friend	of	hers	actually	saw	one." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Fayre-Michell	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Spiritualism	 and	 spirits	 are	 two	 quite	 different	 things,"	 he	 said.	 "One	 may discredit	the	whole	business	of	spiritualism	and	yet	firmly	believe	in	spirits." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	a	narrow-headed,	clean-shaven	man	with	grey	hair	and	moustache.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	a	small	body	on	very	long	legs,	and	though	a	veteran	now,	was	still	one	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	best	game	shots	in	the	West	of	England. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ernest	 Travers	 agreed	 with	 him.	 Indeed,	 they	 all	 agreed.	 Sir	 Walter	 himself summed	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	you're	a	Christian,	you	must	believe	in	the	spirits	of	the	dead,"	he	declared; </p>
<p class="calibre1">"but	to	go	out	of	your	way	to	summon	these	spirits,	to	call	them	from	the	next</p>
<p class="calibre1">world	 back	 to	 ours,	 and	 to	 consult	 people	 who	 profess	 to	 be	 able	 to	 do	 so—</p>
<p class="calibre1">extremely	doubtful	characters,	as	a	rule—that	I	think	is	much	to	be	condemned.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">deny	 that	 there	 are	 any	 living	 mediums	 of	 communication	 between	 the	 spirit world	and	this	one,	and	I	should	always	judge	the	man	or	woman	who	claimed</p>
<p class="calibre1">such	power	to	be	a	charlatan.	But	that	spirits	of	the	departed	have	appeared	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	recognized	by	the	living,	who	shall	deny? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My	son-in-law	has	a	striking	case	in	his	own	recent	experience.	He	actually</p>
<p class="calibre1">knows	a	man	who	was	going	to	sail	on	the	Lusitania,	and	his	greatest	friend	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth,	a	soldier	who	fell	on	the	Maine,	appeared	to	him	and	advised	him	not	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	 so.	 Tom's	 acquaintance	 could	 not	 say	 that	 he	 heard	 words	 uttered,	 but	 he certainly	recognized	his	dead	friend	as	he	stood	by	his	bedside,	and	he	received</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>into	his	mind	a	clear	warning	before	the	vision	disappeared.	Is	that	so,	Tom?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Exactly	 so,	 sir.	 And	 Jack	 Thwaites—that	 was	 the	 name	 of	 the	 man	 in	 New York—told	four	others	about	it,	and	three	took	his	tip	and	didn't	sail.	The	fourth</p>
<p class="calibre1">went;	but	he	wasn't	drowned.	He	came	out	all	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 departed	 are	 certainly	 proved	 to	 appear	 in	 their	 own	 ghostly	 persons—</p>
<p class="calibre1">nay,	 they	 often	 have	 been	 seen	 to	 do	 so,"	 admitted	 Travers.	 "But	 I	 will	 never believe	they	are	at	our	beck	and	call,	to	bang	tambourines	or	move	furniture.	We</p>
<p class="calibre1">cannot	 ring	 up	 the	 dead	 as	 we	 ring	 up	 the	 living	 on	 a	 telephone.	 The	 idea	 is insufferable	and	indecent.	Neither	can	anybody	be	used	as	a	mouth-piece	in	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">way,	or	tell	us	the	present	position	or	occupation	and	interests	of	a	dead	man—or</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	he	smokes,	or	how	his	liquor	tastes.	Such	ideas	degrade	our	impressions	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">life	beyond	the	grave.	They	are,	if	I	may	say	so,	disgustingly	anthropomorphic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	can	we	even	take	it	for	granted	that	our	spirits	will	retain	a	human	form	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">human	attributes	after	death?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	 would	 be	 both	 weak-minded	 and	 irreligious	 to	 attempt	 to	 get	 at	 these things,	no	doubt,"	declared	Colonel	Vane. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	 they	 make	 confusion	 worse	 confounded	 by	 saying	 that	 evil	 spirits pretend	sometimes	to	hoodwink	us	by	posing	as	good	spirits.	Now,	that's	going</p>
<p class="calibre1">too	far,"	said	Henry	Lennox. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	 your	 own	 ghost,	 Sir	 Walter?"	 asked	 Fayre-Michell.	 "It	 is	 a	 curious	 fact that	most	really	ancient	houses	have	some	such	addition.	Is	it	a	family	spectre? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Is	 it	 fairly	 well	 authenticated?	 Does	 it	 reign	 in	 a	 particular	 spot	 of	 house	 or garden?	I	ask	from	no	idle	curiosity.	It	is	a	very	interesting	subject	if	approached in	 a	 proper	 spirit,	 as	 the	 Psychical	 Research	 Society,	 of	 which	 I	 am	 a	 member, does	approach	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 am	 unprepared	 to	 admit	 that	 we	 have	 a	 ghost	 at	 all,"	 repeated	 Sir	 Walter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ancient	houses,	as	you	say,	often	get	some	legend	tacked	on	to	them,	and	here	a garden	walk,	or	there	a	room,	or	passage,	is	associated	with	something	uncanny</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	contrary	to	experience.	This	is	an	old	Tudor	place,	and	has	been	tinkered	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">altered	 in	 successive	 generations.	 We	 have	 one	 room	 at	 the	 eastern	 end	 of	 the great	 corridor	 which	 always	 suffered	 from	 a	 bad	 reputation.	 Nobody	 has	 ever seen	 anything	 in	 our	 time,	 and	 neither	 my	 father	 nor	 grandfather	 ever	 handed down	any	story	of	a	personal	experience.	It	is	a	bedroom,	which	you	shall	see,	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	 care	 to	 do	 so.	 One	 very	 unfortunate	 and	 melancholy	 thing	 happened	 in	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	some	twelve	years	ago,	when	Mary	was	still	a	child—two	years	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	dear	wife	died." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tell	us	nothing	that	can	cause	you	any	pain,	Walter,"	said	Ernest	Travers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>"It	caused	me	very	acute	pain	at	the	time.	Now	it	is	old	history	and	mercifully one	 can	 look	 back	 with	 nothing	 but	 regret.	 One	 must,	 however,	 mention	 an incident	 in	 my	 father's	 time,	 though	 it	 has	 nothing	 to	 do	 with	 my	 own	 painful experience.	However,	that	is	part	of	the	story—if	story	it	can	be	called.	A	death</p>
<p class="calibre1">occurred	 in	 the	 Grey	 Room	 when	 I	 was	 a	 child.	 Owing	 to	 the	 general	 vague feeling	entertained	against	it,	we	never	put	guests	there,	and	so	long	ago	as	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">father's	 day	 it	 was	 relegated	 to	 a	 store	 place	 and	 lumber-store.	 But	 one Christmas,	when	we	were	very	full,	there	came	quite	unexpectedly	on	Christmas</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eve	 an	 aunt	 of	 my	 father—an	 extraordinary	 old	 character	 who	 never	 did</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything	 that	 might	 be	 foreseen.	 She	 had	 never	 come	 to	 the	 family	 reunion before,	yet	appeared	on	this	occasion,	and	declared	that,	as	this	was	going	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	last	Christmas	on	earth,	she	had	felt	it	right	to	join	the	clan—my	father	being</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	head	of	the	family.	Her	sudden	advent	strained	our	resources,	I	suppose,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 herself	 reminded	 us	 of	 the	 Grey	 Room,	 and,	 on	 hearing	 that	 it	 was	 empty, insisted	on	occupying	it.	The	place	is	a	bedroom,	and	my	father,	who	personally</p>
<p class="calibre1">entertained	no	dislike	or	dread	of	it,	raised	not	the	least	objection	to	the	strong-</p>
<p class="calibre1">minded	 old	 lady's	 proposal.	 She	 retired,	 and	 was	 found	 dead	 on	 Christmas</p>
<p class="calibre1">morning.	She	had	not	gone	to	bed,	but	was	just	about	to	do	so,	apparently,	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 had	 fallen	 down	 and	 died.	 She	 was	 eighty-eight,	 had	 undergone	 a	 lengthy coach	 journey	 from	 Exeter,	 and	 had	 eaten	 a	 remarkably	 good	 dinner	 before</p>
<p class="calibre1">going	to	bed.	Her	maid	was	not	suspected,	and	the	doctor	held	her	end	in	no	way</p>
<p class="calibre1">unusual.	 It	 was	 certainly	 never	 associated	 with	 anything	 but	 natural	 causes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed,	only	events	of	much	later	date	served	to	remind	me	of	the	matter.	Then</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	 remembered	 the	 spoiled	 Christmas	 festivities	 and	 the	 callous	 and	 selfish anger	 of	 myself	 and	 various	 other	 young	 people	 that	 our	 rejoicings	 should	 be spoiled	and	Christmas	shorn	of	all	its	usual	delights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	twelve	years	ago	Mary	fell	ill	of	pneumonia—dangerously—and	a	nurse</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	to	be	summoned	in	haste,	since	her	own	faithful	attendant,	Jane	Bond,	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	still	with	us,	could	not	attend	her	both	day	and	night.	A	telegram	to	the	Nurses' </p>
<p class="calibre1">Institute	brought	Mrs.	Gilbert	Forrester—'Nurse	Forrester,'	as	she	preferred	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">called.	 She	 was	 a	 little	 bit	 of	 a	 thing,	 but	 most	 attractive	 and	 capable.	 She	 had been	a	nurse	before	she	married	a	young	medical	man,	and	upon	his	unfortunate</p>
<p class="calibre1">death	she	returned	to	her	profession.	She	desired	her	bedroom	to	be	as	near	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">patient	as	possible,	and	objected,	when	she	found	it	arranged	at	the	other	end	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	corridor.	'Why	not	the	next	room?'	she	inquired;	and	I	had	to	tell	her	that	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">next	 room	 suffered	 from	 a	 bad	 name	 and	 was	 not	 used.	 'A	 bad	 name—is	 it unwholesome?'	 she	 asked;	 and	 I	 explained	 that	 traditions	 credited	 it	 with	 a sinister	 influence.	 'In	 fact,'	 I	 said,	 'it	 is	 supposed	 to	 be	 haunted.	 Not,'	 I	 added, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>'that	anything	has	ever	been	seen,	or	heard	in	my	lifetime;	but	nervous	people	do not	 like	 that	 sort	 of	 room,	 and	 I	 should	 never	 take	 the	 responsibility	 of	 putting anybody	into	it	without	telling	them.'	She	laughed.	'I'm	not	in	the	least	afraid	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">ghosts,	Sir	Walter,'	she	said,	'and	that	must	obviously	be	my	room,	if	you	please. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	necessary	I	should	be	as	near	my	patient	as	possible,	so	that	I	can	be	called</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	once	if	her	own	nurse	is	anxious	when	I	am	not	on	duty.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	we	saw,	of	course,	that	she	was	perfectly	right.	She	was	a	fearless	little woman,	 and	 chaffed	 Masters	 and	 the	 maids	 while	 they	 lighted	 a	 fire	 and	 made the	room	comfortable.	As	a	matter	of	fact,	it	is	an	exceedingly	pleasant	room	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">every	 respect.	 Yet	 I	 hesitated,	 and	 could	 not	 say	 that	 I	 was	 easy	 about	 it.	 I	 felt conscious	of	a	discomfort	which	even	her	indifference	did	not	entirely	banish.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">attributed	it	to	my	acute	anxiety	over	Mary—also	to	a	shadow	of—what?	It	may</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 been	 irritation	 at	 Nurse	 Forrester's	 unconcealed	 contempt	 for	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">superstition.	 The	 Grey	 Room	 is	 large	 and	 commodious	 with	 a	 rather	 fine	 oriel window	 above	 our	 eastern	 porch.	 She	 was	 delighted,	 and	 rated	 me	 very</p>
<p class="calibre1">amusingly	 for	 my	 doubts.	 'I	 hope	 you'll	 never	 call	 such	 a	 lovely	 room	 haunted again	after	I	have	gone,'	said	she. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mary	 took	 to	 her,	 and	 really	 seemed	 easier	 after	 she	 had	 been	 in	 the	 sick-room	an	hour.	She	loved	young	people,	and	had	an	art	to	win	them.	She	was	also</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	most	accomplished	and	quick-witted	nurse.	There	seemed	to	be	quite	a	touch</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 genius	 about	 her.	 Her	 voice	 was	 melodious	 and	 her	 touch	 gentle.	 I	 could appreciate	 her	 skill,	 for	 I	 was	 never	 far	 from	 my	 daughter's	 side	 during	 that anxious	day.	Mrs.	Forrester	came	at	the	critical	hours,	but	declared	herself	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">sanguine	from	the	first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Night	fell;	the	child	was	sleeping	and	Jane	Bond	arrived	to	relieve	the	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	 ten	 o'clock.	 Then	 the	 lady	 retired,	 directed	 that	 she	 should	 be	 called	 at seven	 o'clock,	 or	 at	 any	 moment	 sooner,	 if	 Jane	 wanted	 her.	 I	 sat	 with	 Jane	 I remember	 until	 two,	 and	 then	 turned	 in	 myself.	 Before	 I	 did	 so,	 Mary	 drank some	 milk	 and	 seemed	 to	 be	 holding	 her	 strength	 well.	 I	 was	 worn	 out,	 and despite	my	anxiety	fell	into	deep	sleep,	and	did	not	wake	until	my	man	called	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">half	 an	 hour	 earlier	 than	 usual.	 What	 he	 told	 me	 brought	 me	 quickly	 to	 my senses	and	out	of	bed.	Nurse	Forrester	had	been	called	at	seven	o'clock,	but	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	responded.	Nor	could	the	maid	open	the	door,	for	it	was	locked.	A	quarter	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	hour	later	the	housekeeper	and	Jane	Bond	had	loudly	summoned	her	without</p>
<p class="calibre1">receiving	any	reply.	Then	they	called	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 could	 only	 direct	 that	 the	 door	 should	 be	 forced	 open	 as	 speedily	 as possible,	and	we	were	engaged	in	this	task	when	Mannering,	my	medical	man, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who	shot	with	us	to-day,	arrived	to	see	Mary.	I	told	him	what	had	happened.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>went	in	to	look	at	my	girl,	and	felt	satisfied	that	she	was	holding	her	own	well—</p>
<p class="calibre1">indeed,	he	thought	her	stronger;	and	just	as	he	told	me	so	the	door	into	the	Grey</p>
<p class="calibre1">Room	yielded.	Mannering	and	my	housekeeper,	Mrs.	Forbes,	entered	the	room, </p>
<p class="calibre1">while	Masters,	Fred	Caunter,	my	footman,	who	had	broken	down	the	lock,	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">remained	outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 doctor	 presently	 called	 me,	 and	 I	 went	 in.	 Nurse	 Forrester	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">apparently	 lying	 awake	 in	 bed,	 but	 she	 was	 not	 awake.	 She	 slept	 the	 sleep	 of death.	 Her	 eyes	 were	 open,	 but	 glazed,	 and	 she	 was	 already	 cold.	 Mannering declared	that	she	had	been	dead	for	a	good	many	hours.	Yet,	save	for	a	slight	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">hardly	unnatural	pallor,	not	a	trace	of	death	marked	the	poor	little	creature.	An</p>
<p class="calibre1">expression	 of	 wonder	 seemed	 to	 sit	 on	 her	 features,	 but	 otherwise	 she	 was looking	 much	 as	 I	 had	 last	 seen	 her,	 when	 she	 said	 'Good-night.'	 Everything appeared	to	be	orderly	in	the	room.	It	was	now	flooded	with	the	first	light	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sunny	 morning,	 for	 she	 had	 drawn	 her	 blind	 up	 and	 thrown	 her	 window	 wide open.	 The	 poor	 lady	 passed	 out	 of	 life	 without	 a	 sound	 or	 signal	 to	 indicate trouble,	for	in	the	silence	of	night	Jane	Bond	must	have	heard	any	alarm	had	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">raised	one.	To	me	it	seemed	impossible	to	believe	that	we	gazed	upon	a	corpse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 so	 it	 was,	 though,	 as	 a	 matter	 of	 form,	 the	 doctor	 took	 certain	 measures	 to restore	her.	But	animation	was	not	suspended;	it	had	passed	beyond	recall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	 was	 held	 a	 post-mortem	 examination,	 and	 an	 inquest,	 of	 course;	 and Mannering,	who	felt	deep	professional	interest,	asked	a	friend	from	Plymouth	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">conduct	the	examination.	Their	report	astounded	all	concerned	and	crowned	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mystery,	 for	 not	 a	 trace	 of	 any	 physical	 trouble	 could	 be	 discovered	 to	 explain Nurse	Forrester's	death.	She	was	thin,	but	organically	sound	in	every	particular, </p>
<p class="calibre1">nor	 could	 the	 slightest	 trace	 of	 poison	 be	 reported.	 Life	 had	 simply	 left	 her without	any	physical	reason.	Search	proved	that	she	had	brought	no	drugs	or	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">sort	of	physic	with	her,	and	no	information	to	cast	the	least	light	came	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">institution	for	which	she	worked.	She	was	a	favorite	there,	and	the	news	of	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">sudden	death	brought	sorrow	to	her	many	personal	friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	physicians	felt	their	failure	to	find	a	natural	and	scientific	cause	for	her death.	 Indeed,	 Dr.	 Mordred,	 from	 Plymouth,	 an	 eminent	 pathologist,	 trembled not	a	little	about	it,	as	Mannering	afterwards	told	me.	The	finite	mind	of	science</p>
<p class="calibre1">hates,	 apparently,	 to	 be	 faced	 with	 any	 mystery	 beyond	 its	 power	 to	 explain.	 It regards	 such	 an	 incident	 as	 a	 challenge	 to	 human	 intellect,	 and	 does	 not remember	 that	 we	 are	 encompassed	 with	 mystery	 as	 with	 a	 garment,	 and	 that every	 day	 and	 every	 night	 are	 laden	 with	 phenomena	 for	 which	 man	 cannot</p>
<p class="calibre1">account,	and	never	will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nurse	Forrester's	relations—a	sister	and	an	old	mother—came	to	the	funeral. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>Also	her	dearest	woman	friend,	another	professional	nurse,	whose	name	I	do	not recollect.	She	was	buried	at	Chadlands,	and	her	grave	lies	near	our	graves.	Mary</p>
<p class="calibre1">loves	to	tend	it	still,	though	to	her	the	dead	woman	is	but	a	name.	Yet	to	this	day</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	declares	that	she	can	remember	Nurse	Forrester's	voice	through	her	fever—</p>
<p class="calibre1">gentle,	 yet	 musical	 and	 cheerful.	 As	 for	 me,	 I	 never	 mourned	 so	 brief	 an acquaintance	 so	 heartily.	 To	 part	 with	 the	 bright	 creature,	 so	 full	 of	 life	 and kindliness,	and	to	stand	beside	her	corpse	but	eight	or	nine	hours	afterwards,	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	chastening	and	sad	experience." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	 Walter	 became	 pensive,	 and	 did	 not	 proceed	 for	 the	 space	 of	 a	 minute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">None,	however,	spoke	until	he	had	again	done	so:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	is	the	story	of	what	is	called	our	haunted	room,	so	far	as	this	generation is	 concerned.	 What	 grounds	 for	 its	 sinister	 reputation	 existed	 in	 the	 far	 past	 I know	 not—only	 a	 vague,	 oral	 tradition	 came	 to	 my	 father	 from	 his,	 and	 it	 is certain	that	neither	of	them	attached	any	personal	importance	to	it.	But	after	such</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	peculiar	and	unfortunate	tragedy,	you	will	not	be	surprised	that	I	regarded	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">chamber	 as	 ruled	 out	 from	 my	 domiciliary	 scheme,	 and	 denied	 it	 to	 any	 future guests." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	 you	 really	 associate	 the	 lady's	 death	 with	 the	 room,	 Walter?"	 asked	 Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Travers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Honestly	 I	 do	 not,	 Ernest.	 And	 for	 this	 reason:	 I	 deny	 that	 any	 malignant, spiritual	personality	would	ever	be	permitted	by	the	Creator	to	exercise	physical</p>
<p class="calibre1">powers	over	the	living,	or	destroy	human	beings	without	reason	or	justice.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">horror	of	such	a	possibility	to	the	normal	mind	is	sufficient	argument	against	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Causes	beyond	our	apparent	knowledge	were	responsible	for	the	death	of	Nurse</p>
<p class="calibre1">Forrester;	 but	 who	 shall	 presume	 to	 say	 that	 was	 really	 so?	 Why	 imagine</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything	so	irregular?	I	prefer	to	think	that	had	the	post-mortem	been	conducted</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	somebody	else,	subtle	reasons	for	her	death	might	have	appeared.	Science	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">fallible,	and	even	specialists	make	outrageous	mistakes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	believe	she	died	from	natural	causes	beyond	the	skill	of	those	particular</p>
<p class="calibre1">surgeons	to	discover?"	asked	Colonel	Vane. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	 is	 my	 opinion.	 Needless	 to	 say,	 I	 should	 not	 tell	 Mannering	 so.	 But	 to what	other	conclusion	can	a	reasonable	man	come?	I	do	not,	of	course,	deny	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">supernatural,	 but	 it	 is	 weak-minded	 to	 fall	 back	 upon	 it	 as	 the	 line	 of	 least resistance." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 Fayre-Michell	 repeated	 his	 question.	 He	 had	 listened	 with	 intense</p>
<p class="calibre1">interest	to	the	story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Would	 you	 deny	 that	 ghosts,	 so	 to	 call	 them,	 can	 be	 associated	 with	 one</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>particular	 spot,	 to	 the	 discomfort	 and	 even	 loss	 of	 reason,	 or	 life,	 of	 those	 that may	be	in	that	spot	at	the	psychological	moment,	Sir	Walter?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Emphatically	 I	 would	 deny	 it,"	 declared	 the	 elder.	 "However	 tragic	 the circumstances	 that	 might	 have	 befallen	 an	 unfortunate	 being	 in	 life	 at	 any particular	 place,	 it	 is,	 in	 my	 opinion,	 monstrous	 to	 suppose	 his	 disembodied spirit	will	hereafter	be	associated	with	the	place.	We	must	be	reasonable,	Felix. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shall	the	God	Who	gave	us	reason	be	Himself	unreasonable?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	yet	there	are	authentic—However,	I	admit	the	weight	of	your	argument." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"At	the	same	time,"	ventured	Mr.	Travers,	"none	can	deny	that	many	strange and	 terrible	 things	 happen,	 from	 hidden	 causes	 quite	 beyond	 human	 power	 to explain." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	 do,	 Ernest;	 and	 so	 I	 lock	 up	 my	 Grey	 Room	 and	 rule	 it	 out	 of	 our scheme	of	existence.	At	present	it	is	full	of	lumber—old	furniture	and	a	pack	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">rubbishy	 family	 portraits	 that	 only	 deserve	 to	 be	 burned,	 but	 will	 some	 day	 be restored,	I	suppose." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	 on	 my	 account,	 Uncle	 Walter,"	 said	 Henry	 Lennox.	 "I	 have	 no	 more respect	for	them	than	yourself.	They	are	hopeless	as	art." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	no	one	must	restore	them.	The	art	is	I	believe	very	bad,	as	you	say,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	were	most	worthy	people,	and	this	is	the	sole	memorial	remaining	of	them." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	let	us	see	the	room,	governor,"	urged	Tom	May.	"Mary	showed	it	to	me the	first	time	I	came	here,	and	I	thought	it	about	the	jolliest	spot	in	the	house." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	it	is,	Tom,"	said	Henry.	"Mary	says	it	should	be	called	the	Rose	Room,	not the	grey	one." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	who	care	to	do	so	can	see	it,"	answered	Sir	Walter,	rising.	"We	will	look in	on	our	way	to	bed.	Get	the	key	from	my	key-cabinet	in	the	study,	Henry.	It's</p>
<p class="calibre1">labelled	'Grey	Room.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	II.	AN	EXPERIMENT</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Ernest	 Travers,	 Felix	 Fayre-Michell,	 Tom	 May,	 and	 Colonel	 Vane	 followed</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter	upstairs	to	a	great	corridor,	which	ran	the	length	of	the	main	front,	and upon	 which	 opened	 a	 dozen	 bedrooms	 and	 dressing-rooms.	 They	 proceeded	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	eastern	extremity.	It	was	lighted	throughout,	and	now	their	leader	took	off	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">electric	bulb	from	a	sconce	on	the	wall	outside	the	room	they	had	come	to	visit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	 is	 none	 in	 there,"	 he	 explained,	 "though	 the	 light	 was	 installed	 in	 the Grey	 Room	 as	 elsewhere	 when	 I	 started	 my	 own	 plant	 twenty	 years	 ago.	 My father	never	would	have	it.	He	disliked	it	exceedingly,	and	believed	it	aged	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	arrived	with	the	key.	The	door	was	unlocked,	and	the	light	established. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 party	 entered	 a	 large	 and	 lofty	 chamber	 with	 ceiling	 of	 elaborate	 plaster work	 and	 silver-grey	 walls,	 the	 paper	 on	 which	 was	 somewhat	 tarnished.	 A</p>
<p class="calibre1">pattern	 of	 dim,	 pink	 roses	 as	 large	 as	 cabbages	 ran	 riot	 over	 it.	 A	 great	 oriel window	 looked	 east,	 while	 a	 smaller	 one	 opened	 upon	 the	 south.	 Round	 the curve	of	the	oriel	ran	a	cushioned	seat	eighteen	inches	above	the	ground,	while</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	western	side	of	the	room,	set	in	the	internal	wall,	was	a	modern	fireplace</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 a	 white	 Adams	 mantel	 above	 it.	 Some	 old,	 carved	 chairs	 stood	 round	 the walls,	 and	 in	 one	 corner,	 stacked	 together,	 lay	 half	 a	 dozen	 old	 oil	 portraits, grimy	 and	 faded.	 They	 called	 for	 the	 restorer,	 but	 were	 doubtfully	 worth	 his labors.	 Two	 large	 chests	 of	 drawers,	 with	 rounded	 bellies,	 and	 a	 very	 beautiful washing-stand	 also	 occupied	 places	 round	 the	 room,	 and	 against	 the	 inner	 wall rose	 a	 single,	 fourposter	 bed	 of	 Spanish	 chestnut,	 also	 carved.	 A	 grey,	 self-colored	 carpet	 covered	 the	 floor,	 and	 on	 one	 of	 the	 chests	 stood	 a	 miniature bronze	copy	of	the	Faun	of	Praxiteles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 apartment	 was	 bright	 and	 cheerful	 of	 aspect.	 Nothing	 gloomy	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1">depressing	marked	it,	nor	a	suggestion	of	the	sinister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Could	one	wish	for	a	more	amiable	looking	room?"	asked	Fayre-Michell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 gazed	 round	 them,	 and	 Ernest	 Travers	 expressed	 admiration	 at	 the	 old furniture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My	dear	Walter,	why	hide	these	things	here?"	he	asked.	"They	are	beautiful, and	may	be	valuable,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've	 been	 asked	 the	 same	 question	 before,"	 answered	 the	 owner.	 "And	 they</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>are	valuable.	Lord	Bolsover	offered	me	a	thousand	guineas	for	those	two	chairs; but	 the	 things	 are	 heirlooms	 in	 a	 sort	 of	 way,	 and	 I	 shouldn't	 feel	 justified	 in parting	 with	 them.	 My	 grandfather	 was	 furniture	 mad—spent	 half	 his	 time</p>
<p class="calibre1">collecting	old	stuff	on	the	Continent.	Spain	was	his	happy	hunting	ground." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	 positively	 a	 shame	 to	 doom	 these	 chairs	 to	 a	 haunted	 room,	 uncle," </p>
<p class="calibre1">declared	Henry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	the	other	shook	his	head	and	smothered	a	yawn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	house	is	too	full	as	it	is."	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mary	wants	you	to	scrap	dozens	of	things,"	replied	his	nephew.	"Then	there'd be	plenty	of	room." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You'll	do	what	you	please	when	your	turn	comes,	and	no	doubt	cast	out	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">tusks	 and	 antlers	 and	 tiger-skins,	 which	 I	 know	 you	 don't	 admire.	 Wait	 in patience,	Henry.	And	we	will	now	go	to	bed,"	answered	the	elder.	"I	am	fatigued, and	it	must	be	nearly	midnight." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	Tom	May	brought	their	thoughts	back	to	the	reason	of	the	visit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Look	 here,	 governor,"	 he	 said.	 "It's	 a	 scandal	 to	 give	 a	 champion	 room	 like this	a	bad	name	and	shut	it	up.	You've	fallen	into	the	habit,	but	you	know	it's	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">nonsense.	Mary	loves	this	room.	I'll	make	you	a	sporting	offer.	Let	me	sleep	in	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">to-night,	and	then,	when	I	report	a	clean	bill	to-morrow,	you	can	throw	it	open</p>
<p class="calibre1">again	 and	 announce	 it	 is	 forgiven	 without	 a	 stain	 on	 its	 character.	 You've	 just said	you	don't	believe	spooks	have	the	power	to	hurt	anybody.	Then	let	me	turn</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter,	however,	refused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	Tom;	most	certainly	not.	It's	far	too	late	to	go	over	the	ground	again	and explain	why,	but	I	don't	wish	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	milder-mannered	room	was	never	seen,"	said	Ernest	Travers.	"You	must	let me	look	at	it	by	daylight,	and	bring	Nelly.	The	ceiling,	too,	is	evidently	very	fine</p>
<p class="calibre1">—finer	even	than	the	one	in	my	room." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	ceilings	here	were	all	the	work	of	Italians	in	Tudor	times,"	explained	his friend.	 "They	 are	 Elizabethan.	 The	 plaster	 is	 certainly	 wonderful,	 and	 my ceilings	are	considered	as	good	as	anything	in	the	country,	I	believe." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned,	and	the	rest	followed	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	removed	the	electric	bulb,	and	restored	it	to	its	place	outside.	Then	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">uncle	gave	him	the	key. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Put	it	back	in	the	cabinet,"	he	said.	"I	won't	go	down	again." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>The	 party	 broke	 up,	 and	 all	 save	 Lennox	 and	 the	 sailor	 went	 to	 their	 rooms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	two	younger	men	descended	together	and,	when	out	of	ear-shot	of	his	uncle, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Look	here,	Tom,"	he	said,	"you've	given	me	a	tip.	I'm	going	to	camp	out	in the	Grey	Room	to-night.	Then,	in	the	morning,	I'll	tell	Uncle	Walter	I	have	done</p>
<p class="calibre1">so,	and	the	ghost's	number	will	be	up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Quite	all	right,	old	man—only	the	plan	must	be	modified.	I'll	sleep	there.	I'm death	on	it,	and	the	brilliant	inspiration	was	mine,	remember." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	can't.	He	refused	to	let	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	didn't	hear	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	yes,	you	did—everybody	did.	Besides,	this	is	fairly	my	task—you	won't</p>
<p class="calibre1">deny	 that.	 Chadlands	 will	 be	 mine,	 some	 day,	 so	 it's	 up	 to	 me	 to	 knock	 this musty	 yarn	 on	 the	 head	 once	 and	 for	 all.	 Could	 anything	 be	 more	 absurd	 than shutting	up	a	fine	room	like	that?	I'm	really	rather	ashamed	of	Uncle	Walter." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	course	it's	absurd	but,	honestly,	I'm	rather	keen	about	this.	I'd	dearly	love to	add	a	medieval	phantom	to	my	experiences,	and	only	wish	I	thought	anything</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	show	up.	I	beg	you'll	raise	no	objection.	It	was	my	idea,	and	I	very	much</p>
<p class="calibre1">wish	 to	 make	 the	 experiment.	 Of	 course,	 I	 don't	 believe	 in	 anything</p>
<p class="calibre1">supernatural." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 went	 back	 to	 the	 billiard-room,	 dismissed	 Fred	 Caunter,	 the	 footman, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who	 was	 waiting	 to	 put	 out	 the	 lights,	 and	 continued	 their	 discussion.	 The argument	began	to	grow	strenuous,	for	each	proved	determined,	and	who	owned</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	stronger	will	seemed	a	doubtful	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	time,	since	no	conclusion	could	satisfy	both,	they	abandoned	the	centre</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 contention	 and	 debated,	 as	 their	 elders	 had	 done,	 on	 the	 general	 question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	declared	himself	not	wholly	convinced.	He	adopted	an	agnostic	attitude, </p>
<p class="calibre1">while	 Tom	 frankly	 disbelieved.	 The	 one	 preserved	 an	 open	 mind,	 the	 other</p>
<p class="calibre1">scoffed	at	apparitions	in	general. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	 humbug	 to	 say	 sailors	 are	 superstitious	 now,"	 he	 asserted.	 "They	 might have	 been,	 but	 my	 experience	 is	 that	 they	 are	 no	 more	 credulous	 than	 other people	in	these	days.	Anyway,	I'm	not.	Life	is	a	matter	of	chemistry.	There's	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">mumbo	jumbo	about	it,	in	my	opinion.	Chemical	analysis	has	reached	down	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">hormones	 and	 enzymes	 and	 all	 manner	 of	 subtle	 secretions	 discovered	 by	 this generation	of	inquirers;	but	it's	all	organic.	Nobody	has	ever	found	anything	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">isn't.	Existence	depends	on	matter,	and	when	the	chemical	process	breaks	down, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 organism	 perishes	 and	 leaves	 nothing.	 When	 a	 man	 can't	 go	 on	 breathing, he's	dead,	and	there's	an	end	of	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>But	Henry	had	read	modern	science	also. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	 about	 the	 vital	 spark,	 then?	 Biologists	 don't	 turn	 down	 the	 theory	 of vitalism,	do	they?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Most	of	them	do,	who	count,	my	dear	chap.	The	presence	of	a	vital	spark—a</p>
<p class="calibre1">spark	that	cannot	be	put	out—is	merely	a	theory	with	nothing	to	prove	it.	When</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 dies,	 the	 animating	 principle	 doesn't	 leave	 a	 man,	 and	 go	 off	 on	 its	 own.	 It dies	too.	It	was	part	of	the	man—as	much	as	his	heart	or	brain." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	 only	 an	 opinion.	 Nobody	 can	 be	 positive.	 We	 don't	 know	 anything about	what	life	really	means,	and	we	haven't	got	the	machinery	to	find	out." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"By	 analogy	 we	 can,"	 argued	 Tom.	 "Where	 are	 you	 going	 to	 draw	 the	 line? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Life	 is	 life,	 and	 a	 sponge	 is	 just	 as	 much	 alive	 as	 a	 herring;	 a	 nettle	 is	 just	 as much	alive	as	an	oak-tree;	and	an	oak-tree	is	just	as	much	alive	as	you	are.	What</p>
<p class="calibre1">becomes	of	its	vital	spark	when	you	eat	an	oyster?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	wouldn't	believe	in	a	life	after	death	at	all,	then?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	 a	 pure	 assumption,	 Henry.	 I'd	 like	 to	 believe	 in	 it—who	 wouldn't? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because,	 if	 you	 honestly	 did,	 it	 would	 transform	 this	 life	 into	 something infinitely	different	from	what	it	is." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	ought	to—yet	it	doesn't	seem	to." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	ought	to,	certainly.	If	you	believe	this	life	is	only	the	portal	to	another	of much	greater	importance,	then—well,	there	you	are.	Nothing	matters	but	trying</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	make	everybody	else	believe	it,	too.	But	as	a	matter	of	fact,	the	people	who	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe	it,	or	think	they	do,	seem	to	me	just	as	concentrated	on	this	life	and	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	much	out	to	get	the	very	best	they	can	from	it,	and	wring	it	dry,	as	I	am,	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">reckon	it's	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	believe	as	a	matter	of	course,	and	don't	seem	to	realize	how	much	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">belief	ought	to	imply,"	confessed	Henry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why	do	they	believe?	Because	most	of	them	haven't	really	thought	about	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	than	a	turnip	thinks.	They	dwell	in	a	foggy	sort	of	way	on	the	future	life</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	they	go	to	church	on	Sundays;	then	they	return	home	and	forget	all	about	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">till	next	Sunday." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lennox	brought	him	back	to	the	present	difference. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	 seeing	 you	 laugh	 at	 ghosts,	 and	 I	 remain	 doubtful,	 it's	 only	 fair	 that	 I sleep	 in	 the	 Grey	 Room.	 You	 must	 see	 that.	 Ghosts	 hate	 people	 who	 don't believe	in	them.	They'd	cold	shoulder	you;	but	in	my	case	they	might	feel	I	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">good	material,	worth	convincing.	They	might	show	up	for	me	in	a	friendly	spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	they	show	for	you,	it	will	probably	be	to	bully	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>Tom	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	what	I	want.	I'd	like	to	have	it	out	and	talk	sense	to	a	spook,	and	show him	 what	 an	 ass	 he's	 making	 of	 himself.	 The	 governor	 was	 right	 about	 that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 Fayre-Michell	 asked	 if	 he	 believed	 in	 them	 loafing	 about	 a	 place	 where they'd	been	murdered	or	otherwise	maltreated,	he	rejected	the	idea." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yet	a	woman	certainly	died	there,	and	without	a	shadow	of	reason." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	probably	died	for	a	very	good	reason,	only	we	don't	happen	to	know	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	tried	a	different	argument. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're	 married,	 and	 you	 matter;	 I'm	 not	 married,	 and	 don't	 matter	 to anybody." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Humbug!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mary	wouldn't	like	it,	anyway;	you	know	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"True—she'd	hate	it.	But	she	won't	know	anything	about	it	till	to-morrow.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">always	sleeps	in	her	old	nursery	when	she	comes	here,	and	I'm	down	the	corridor</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	the	far	end.	She'd	have	a	fit	if	she	knew	I'd	turned	in	next	door	to	her	and	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">snoozing	in	the	Grey	Room;	but	she	won't	know	till	I	tell	her	of	my	rash	act	to-</p>
<p class="calibre1">morrow.	Don't	think	I'm	a	fool.	Nobody	loves	life	better	than	I	do,	and	nobody</p>
<p class="calibre1">has	better	reason	to.	But	I'm	positive	that	this	is	all	rank	nonsense,	and	so	are	you really.	 We	 know	 there's	 nothing	 in	 the	 room	 with	 a	 shadow	 of	 supernatural danger	 about	 it.	 Besides,	 you	 wouldn't	 want	 to	 sleep	 there	 so	 badly	 if	 you believed	anything	wicked	was	waiting	for	you.	You're	tons	cleverer	than	I	am—</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	you	must	agree	about	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lennox	was	bound	to	confess	that	he	entertained	no	personal	fear.	They	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">argued,	and	the	clock	struck	midnight.	Then	the	sailor	made	a	suggestion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Since	you're	so	infernally	obstinate,	I'll	do	this.	We'll	toss	up,	and	the	winner can	have	the	fun.	That's	fair	to	both." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	other	agreed;	he	tossed	a	coin,	and	May	called	"tails,"	and	won. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 was	 jubilant,	 while	 Henry	 showed	 a	 measure	 of	 annoyance.	 The	 other</p>
<p class="calibre1">consoled	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	better	so,	old	man.	You're	highly	strung	and	nervy,	and	a	poet	and	all	that sort	of	thing.	I'm	no	better	than	a	prize	ox,	and	don't	know	what	nerves	mean.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	sleep	anywhere,	anyhow.	If	you	can	sleep	in	a	submarine,	you	bet	you	can	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	nice,	airy	Elizabethan	room,	even	if	it	is	haunted.	But	it's	not;	that's	the	whole point.	 There's	 not	 a	 haunted	 room	 in	 the	 world.	 Get	 me	 your	 service	 revolver, like	a	good	chap." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	was	silent,	and	Tom	rose	to	make	ready	for	his	vigil. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>"I'm	dog-tired,	anyhow,"	he	said.	"Nothing	less	than	Queen	Elizabeth	herself will	keep	me	awake,	if	it	does	appear." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	the	other	surprised	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	 think	 I	 want	 to	 go	 back	 on	 it.	 You've	 won	 the	 right	 to	 make	 the experiment—if	 we	 ignore	 Uncle	 Walter.	 But—well,	 you'll	 laugh,	 yet,	 on	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">honor,	Tom,	I've	got	a	feeling	I'd	rather	you	didn't.	It	isn't	nerves.	I'm	not	nervy any	more	than	you	are.	I'm	not	suggesting	that	I	go	now,	of	course.	But	I	do	ask</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	to	think	better	of	it	and	chuck	the	thing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	 one	 can't	 help	 one's	 feelings.	 I	 do	 feel	 a	 rum	 sort	 of	 conviction	 at	 the bottom	of	my	mind	that	it's	not	good	enough.	I	can't	explain;	there	are	no	words</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	it	that	I	know,	but	it's	growing	on	me.	Intuition,	perhaps." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Intuition	of	what?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	can't	tell	you.	But	I	ask	you	not	to	go." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	were	going	if	you'd	won	the	toss?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	your	growing	intuition	is	only	because	I	won	it.	Hanged	if	I	don't	think</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	want	to	funk	me,	old	man!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	couldn't	do	that.	But	it's	different	me	going	and	you	going.	I've	got	nothing to	 live	 for.	 Don't	 think	 I'm	 maudlin,	 or	 any	 rot	 of	 that	 sort;	 but	 you	 know	 all about	the	past.	I've	never	mentioned	it	to	you,	and,	of	course,	you	haven't	to	me; </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I	never	should	have.	But	I	will	now.	I	loved	Mary	with	all	my	heart	and	soul, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom.	 She	 didn't	 know	 how	 much,	 and	 probably	 I	 didn't	 either.	 But	 that's	 done, and	no	man	on	earth	rejoices	in	her	great	happiness	more	than	I	do.	And	no	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	earth	is	going	to	be	a	better	or	a	truer	friend	to	you	and	her	than,	please	God,	I shall	be.	But	that	being	so,	can't	you	see	the	rest?	My	life	ended	in	a	way	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 dream	 of	 my	 life	 ended.	 I	 attach	 no	 importance	 to	 living	 for	 itself,	 and	 if anything	 final	 happened	 to	 me	 it	 wouldn't	 leave	 a	 blank	 anywhere.	 You're</p>
<p class="calibre1">different.	In	sober	honesty	you	oughtn't	to	run	into	any	needless	danger—real	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">imaginary.	I'm	thinking	of	Mary	only	when	I	say	that—not	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	I	deny	the	danger." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes;	 only	 you	 might	 listen.	 So	 did	 I,	 but	 I	 deny	 it	 no	 longer.	 The	 case	 is altered	when	I	tell	you	in	all	seriousness—when	I	take	my	oath	if	you	like—that</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 do	 believe	 now	 there	 is	 something	 in	 this.	 I	 don't	 say	 it's	 supernatural,	 and	 I don't	say	it	isn't;	but	I	do	feel	deeply	impressed	in	my	mind	now,	and	it's	growing</p>
<p class="calibre1">stronger	every	minute,	that	there's	something	here	out	of	the	common	and	really</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>infernally	dangerous." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	other	looked	at	him	in	astonishment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	bee	has	got	into	your	bonnet?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	call	it	that.	It's	a	conviction,	Tom.	Do	be	guided	by	me,	old	chap!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sailor	flushed	a	little,	emptied	his	glass,	and	rose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	you	really	wanted	to	choke	me	off,	you	chose	a	funny	way	to	do	so.	Surely</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 only	 needed	 this	 to	 determine	 anybody.	 If	 you,	 as	 a	 sane	 person,	 honestly believe	there's	a	pinch	of	danger	in	that	blessed	place,	then	I	certainly	sleep	there to-night,	or	else	wake	there." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let	me	come,	too,	then,	Tom." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	 be	 damned	 for	 a	 yarn!	 Ghosts	 don't	 show	 up	 for	 two	 people—haven't got	pluck	enough.	If	I	get	any	sport,	I'll	be	quite	straight	about	it,	and	you	shall try	your	luck	to-morrow." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	can	only	make	it	a	favor;	and	not	for	your	own	sake,	either." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 know.	 Mary	 will	 be	 sleeping	 the	 sleep	 of	 the	 just	 in	 the	 next	 room.	 How little	she'll	guess!	Perhaps,	if	I	see	an	apparition	worthy	of	the	Golden	Age,	I'll</p>
<p class="calibre1">call	her	up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	oblige	me,	May." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In	 anything	 on	 earth	 but	 this	 thing.	 It's	 really	 too	 late	 now.	 Don't	 you	 see you've	defeated	your	own	object?	You	mustn't	ask	me	to	throw	up	the	sponge	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	 sudden	 intuition	 of	 danger	 sprung	 on	 me	 at	 the	 eleventh	 hour.	 I	 won	 the toss,	and	can't	take	my	orders	from	you,	old	chap,	can	I?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	other,	in	his	turn,	grew	a	little	warm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	right.	I've	spoken.	I	think	you're	rather	a	fool	to	be	so	obstinate.	It	isn't	as if	 a	 nervous	 old	 woman	 was	 talking	 to	 you.	 But	 you'll	 go	 your	 own	 way.	 It doesn't	 matter	 a	 button	 to	 me,	 and	 I	 only	 made	 it	 a	 favor	 for	 somebody	 else's sake." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We'll	leave	it	at	that,	then.	May	I	trouble	you	for	the	key?	And	your	revolver, too.	I	haven't	got	mine	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	hesitated.	The	key	was	in	the	pocket	of	his	jacket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	is	a	matter	of	honor,	Lennox,"	said	the	sailor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	other	handed	over	the	key	on	this	speech,	and	prepared	to	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	get	the	revolver,"	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thanks.	Look	me	up	in	the	morning,	if	you're	awake	first,"	added	May;	but the	other	did	not	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>He	 let	 Tom	 precede	 him,	 and	 then	 turned	 out	 the	 lights.	 Other	 lights	 he	 also extinguished	 as	 they	 left	 the	 hall	 and	 ascended	 the	 stairs.	 The	 younger's	 pride was	struggling	for	mastery;	but	he	conquered	it	and	spoke	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	wish	to	Heaven	you	could	see	it	from	another	point	of	view	than	your	own, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 have	 no	 point	 of	 view.	 You're	 rather	 exasperating,	 and	 don't	 seem	 to understand	 that,	 even	 if	 I	 might	 have	 changed	 my	 mind	 before,	 it's	 impossible now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	really	only	a	foolish	sort	of	pride.	If	I	chose	my	words	clumsily—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	did.	The	devil	and	all	his	angels	wouldn't	make	me	climb	down	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	younger	left	him,	and	returned	in	a	minute	or	two	with	the	revolver. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good-night,"	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good-night,	old	boy.	Thank	you.	Loaded?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In	all	the	chambers.	Funny	you	should	want	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Take	it	back,	then." </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 Henry	 did	 not	 answer,	 and	 they	 parted.	 Each	 sought	 his	 own	 bedroom, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	while	Lennox	retired	at	once	and	might	have	been	expected	to	pass	a	night</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	mentally	peaceful	than	the	other,	in	reality	it	was	not	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	younger	slept	ill,	while	May	suffered	no	emotion	but	annoyance.	He	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">contemptuous	 of	 Henry.	 It	 seemed	 to	 him	 that	 he	 had	 taken	 a	 rather	 mean	 and unsporting	line,	nor	did	he	believe	for	a	moment	that	he	was	honest.	Lennox	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	modern	mind;	he	had	been	through	the	furnace	of	war;	he	had	received	a	first-</p>
<p class="calibre1">class	education.	It	seemed	impossible	to	imagine	that	he	spoke	the	truth,	or	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 sudden	 suspicion	 of	 real	 perils,	 beyond	 human	 power	 to	 combat,	 could	 be anything	but	a	spiteful	attempt	to	put	May	off,	after	he	himself	had	lost	the	toss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet	 that	 seemed	 unlike	 a	 gentleman.	 Then	 the	 allusion	 to	 Mary	 perturbed	 the sailor.	 He	 could	 not	 quarrel	 with	 the	 words,	 but	 he	 resented	 the	 advice,	 seeing what	it	was	based	upon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 anger	 lessened	 swiftly,	 however,	 and	 before	 he	 started	 his	 adventure	 he had	 dismissed	 Henry	 from	 his	 mind.	 He	 put	 on	 pyjamas	 and	 a	 dressing-gown, took	a	candle,	a	railway-rug,	his	watch,	and	the	loaded	revolver. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he	walked	quietly	down	the	corridor	to	the	Grey	Room.	On	reaching	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 usual	 good	 temper	 returned,	 and	 he	 found	 himself	 entirely	 happy	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">contented.	 He	 unlocked	 the	 forbidden	 entrance,	 set	 his	 candle	 by	 the	 bed,	 and locked	the	door	again	from	inside.	He	rolled	up	his	dressing-gown	for	a	pillow, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 placed	 his	 watch	 and	 revolver	 and	 candle	 at	 his	 hand	 on	 a	 chair.	 A	 few</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>broken	reflections	drifted	through	his	mind,	as	he	yawned	and	prepared	to	sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	brain	brought	up	events	of	the	day—a	missed	shot,	a	good	shot,	lunch	under</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	haystack	with	Mary	and	Fayre-Michell's	niece.	She	was	smart	and	showy	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">slangy—cheap	every	way	compared	with	Mary.	What	would	his	wife	think	if	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew	he	was	so	near?	Come	to	him	for	certain.	He	cordially	hoped	that	he	might</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	be	recalled	to	his	ship;	but	there	was	a	possibility	of	it.	It	would	be	rather	a lark	to	show	the	governor	over	the	Indomitable.	She	was	a	"hush-hush"	ship—</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	 of	 the	 wonders	 of	 the	 Navy	 still.	 Funny	 that	 the	 Italian	 roof	 of	 the	 Grey Room	 looked	 like	 a	 dome,	 though	 it	 was	 really	 flat.	 A	 cunning	 trick	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">perspective. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	a	still	and	silent	night,	moonless,	very	dark,	and	very	tranquil.	He	went</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	window	to	throw	it	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only	a	solitary	being	waked	long	that	night	at	Chadlands,	and	only	a	solitary</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind	 suffered	 tribulation.	 But	 into	 the	 small	 hours	 Henry	 Lennox	 endured	 the companionship	 of	 disquiet	 thoughts.	 He	 could	 not	 sleep,	 and	 his	 brain,	 clear enough,	retraced	no	passage	from	the	past	day.	Indeed	the	events	of	the	day	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">sunk	 into	 remote	 time.	 He	 was	 only	 concerned	 with	 the	 present,	 and	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">wondered	while	he	worried	that	he	should	be	worrying.	Yet	a	proleptic	instinct</p>
<p class="calibre1">made	him	look	forward.	He	had	neither	lied	nor	exaggerated	to	May.	From	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment	 of	 losing	 the	 toss,	 he	 honestly	 experienced	 a	 strong,	 subjective</p>
<p class="calibre1">impression	of	danger	arising	out	of	the	proposed	attack	on	the	mysteries	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Grey	 Room.	 It	 was,	 indeed,	 that	 consciousness	 of	 greater	 possibilities	 in	 the adventure	 than	 May	 admitted	 or	 imagined	 which	 made	 Lennox	 so	 insistent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking	back,	he	perceived	many	things,	and	chiefly	that	he	had	taken	a	wrong</p>
<p class="calibre1">line,	and	approached	Mary's	husband	from	a	fatal	angle.	Too	late	he	recognized</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 error.	 It	 was	 inevitable	 that	 a	 hint	 of	 suspected	 danger	 would	 confirm	 the sailor	 in	 his	 resolution;	 and	 that	 such	 a	 hint	 should	 follow	 the	 spin	 of	 the	 coin against	Lennox,	and	be	accompanied	by	the	assurance	that,	had	he	won,	Henry</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	have	proceeded,	despite	his	intuitions,	to	do	what	he	now	begged	Tom	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	do—that	was	a	piece	of	clumsy	work	which	he	deeply	regretted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	hour	when	his	own	physical	forces	were	lowest,	his	errors	of	diplomacy</p>
<p class="calibre1">forced	 themselves	 upon	 his	 mind.	 He	 wasted	 much	 time,	 as	 all	 men	 do	 upon their	beds,	in	anticipating	to-morrow;	in	considering	what	is	going	to	happen,	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	 is	 not;	 in	 weighing	 their	 own	 future	 words	 and	 deeds	 given	 a	 variety	 of contingencies.	 For	 reason,	 which	 at	 first	 kept	 him,	 despite	 his	 disquiet,	 in	 the region	 of	 the	 rational,	 grew	 weaker	 with	 Henry	 as	 the	 night	 advanced;	 the shadow	 of	 trouble	 deepened	 as	 his	 weary	 wits	 lost	 their	 balance	 to	 combat	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 premonition	 was	 as	 formless	 and	 amorphous	 as	 a	 cloud,	 and,	 though	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>could	not	see	any	shape	to	his	fear,	or	define	its	limitations,	it	grew	darker	ere	he slept.	 He	 considered	 what	 might	 happen	 and,	 putting	 aside	 any	 lesser	 disaster, tried	to	imagine	what	the	morning	would	bring	if	May	actually	succumbed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 the	 moment	 the	 size	 of	 such	 an	 imaginary	 disaster	 served	 curiously	 to lessen	his	uneasiness.	Pushed	to	extremities,	the	idea	became	merely	absurd.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">won	a	sort	of	comfort	from	such	an	outrageous	proposition,	because	it	brought</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	back	to	the	solid	ground	of	reason	and	the	assurance	that	some	things	simply</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	 not	 happen.	 From	 this	 extravagant	 summit	 of	 horror,	 his	 fears	 gradually receded.	Such	a	waking	nightmare	even	quieted	his	nerves	when	it	was	past;	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	 a	 possibility	 presents	 a	 ludicrous	 side,	 then	 its	 horror	 must	 diminish	 by	 so much.	 Moreover,	 Henry	 told	 himself	 that	 if	 the	 threat	 of	 a	 disaster	 so	 absolute could	 really	 be	 felt	 by	 him,	 it	 was	 his	 duty	 to	 rise	 at	 once,	 intervene,	 and,	 if necessary,	 summon	 his	 uncle	 and	 force	 May	 to	 leave	 the	 Grey	 Room</p>
<p class="calibre1">immediately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 idea	 amused	 him	 again	 and	 offered	 another	 jest.	 The	 tragedy	 really</p>
<p class="calibre1">resolved	into	jests.	He	found	himself	smiling	at	the	picture	of	May	being	treated</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	a	disobedient	schoolboy.	But	if	that	happened,	and	Tom	was	proclaimed	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sinner,	 what	 must	 be	 Henry's	 own	 fate?	 To	 win	 the	 reputation	 of	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">unsportsmanlike	 sneak	 in	 Mary's	 opinion	 as	 well	 as	 Tom's.	 He	 certainly	 could call	upon	nobody	to	help	him	now.	But	he	might	go	and	look	up	May	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	would	be	very	sharply	resented,	however.	He	travelled	round	and	round	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">circles,	 then	 asked	 himself	 what	 he	 would	 do	 and	 say	 to-morrow	 if	 anything happened	to	Tom—nothing,	of	course,	fatal,	but	something	perhaps	so	grave	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">May	himself	would	be	unable	to	explain	it.	In	that	case	Henry	could	only	state</p>
<p class="calibre1">facts	exactly	as	they	had	occurred.	But	there	would	be	a	deuce	of	a	muddle	if	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 to	 make	 statements	 and	 describe	 the	 exact	 sequence	 of	 recent	 incidents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Already	he	forgot	the	exact	sequence.	It	seemed	ages	since	he	parted	from	May. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	broke	off	there,	rose,	drank	a	glass	of	water,	and	lighted	a	cigarette.	He	shook</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself	into	wakefulness,	condemned	himself	for	this	debauch	of	weak-minded</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinking,	 found	 the	 time	 to	 be	 three	 o'clock,	 and	 brushed	 the	 whole	 cobweb tangle	from	his	mind.	He	knew	that	sudden	warmth	after	cold	will	often	induce</p>
<p class="calibre1">sleep—a	fact	proved	by	incidents	of	his	campaigns—so	he	trudged	up	and	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	opened	his	window	and	let	the	cool	breath	of	the	night	chill	his	forehead	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">breast	for	five	minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 action	 calmed	 him,	 and	 he	 headed	 himself	 off	 from	 returning	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">subject.	He	felt	that	mental	dread	and	discomfort	were	only	waiting	to	break	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">again;	 but	 he	 smothered	 them,	 returned	 to	 bed,	 and	 succeeded	 in	 keeping	 his mind	on	neutral-tinted	matter	until	he	fell	asleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>He	 woke	 again	 before	 he	 was	 called,	 rose	 and	 went	 to	 his	 bath.	 He	 took	 it cold,	 and	 it	 refreshed	 him	 and	 cleared	 his	 head,	 for	 he	 had	 a	 headache. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything	was	changed,	and	the	phantoms	of	his	imagination	remained	only	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">memories	 to	 be	 laughed	 at.	 He	 no	 longer	 felt	 alarm	 or	 anxiety.	 He	 dressed presently,	and	guessing	that	Tom,	always	the	first	to	rise,	might	already	be	out	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">doors,	he	strolled	on	to	the	terrace	presently	to	meet	him	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Already	 he	 speculated	 whether	 an	 apology	 was	 due	 from	 him	 to	 May,	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1">whether	 he	 might	 himself	 expect	 one.	 It	 didn't	 matter.	 He	 knew	 perfectly	 well that	Tom	was	all	right	now,	and	that	was	the	only	thing	that	signified. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	III.	AT	THE	ORIEL</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">as	in	elevation,	and,	at	its	date,	the	great	mansion	had	stood	for	the	last	word	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">perfection,	when	men	thought	on	large	lines	and	the	conditions	of	labour	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible	 achievements	 now	 seldom	 within	 the	 power	 of	 a	 private	 purse.	 Much had	since	been	done,	but	the	main	architectural	features	were	preserved,	though</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	interior	of	the	great	house	was	transformed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	manor	of	Chadlands	extended	to	some	fifty	thousand	acres	lying	in	a	river</p>
<p class="calibre1">valley	between	the	heights	of	Haldon	on	the	east	and	the	frontiers	of	Dartmoor</p>
<p class="calibre1">westerly.	The	little	township	was	connected	by	a	branch	with	the	Great	Western</p>
<p class="calibre1">Railway,	and	the	station	lay	five	miles	from	the	manor	house.	No	more	perfect</p>
<p class="calibre1">parklands,	albeit	on	a	modest	scale,	existed	in	South	Devon,	and	the	views	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">surrounding	heights	and	great	vale	opening	from	the	estate	caused	pleasure	alike</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	those	contented	with	obvious	beauty	and	the	small	number	of	spectators	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">understood	the	significance	of	what	constitutes	really	distinguished	landscape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eastward,	long	slopes	of	herbage	and	drifts	of	azaleas—a	glorious	harmony	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">gold,	 scarlet,	 and	 orange	 in	 June—sloped	 upwards	 to	 larch	 woods;	 while	 the gardens	 of	 pleasure,	 watered	 by	 a	 little	 trout	 stream,	 spread	 beneath	 the	 manor house,	 and	 behind	 it	 rose	 hot-houses	 and	 the	 glass	 and	 walled	 gardens	 of	 fruit and	 vegetables.	 To	 the	 south	 and	 west	 opened	 park	 and	 vale,	 where	 receded forest	 and	 fallow	 lands,	 until	 the	 grey	 ramparts	 of	 the	 moor	 ascending	 beyond them	hemmed	in	the	picture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter	Lennox	had	devoted	himself	to	the	sporting	side	of	the	estate	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 made	 it	 famous	 in	 this	 respect.	 His	 father,	 less	 interested	 in	 shooting	 and hunting,	had	devoted	time	and	means	to	the	flower	gardens,	and	rendered	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	rich	as	was	possible	in	his	day;	while	earlier	yet,	Sir	Walter's	grandfather	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	more	concerned	for	the	interior,	and	had	done	much	to	enrich	and	beautify</p>
<p class="calibre1">it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	great	terrace	stretched	between	the	south	front	and	a	balustrade	of	granite, </p>
<p class="calibre1">that	separated	it	from	the	gardens	spreading	at	a	lower	level.	Here	walked	Henry</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>Lennox	and	sought	Tom	May.	It	was	now	past	eight	o'clock	on	Sunday	morning, and	 he	 found	 himself	 alone.	 The	 sun,	 breaking	 through	 heaviness	 of	 morning clouds,	 had	 risen	 clear	 of	 Haldon	 Hills	 and	 cast	 a	 radiance,	 still	 dimmed	 by vapour,	over	the	glow	of	the	autumn	trees.	Subdued	sounds	of	birds	came	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 glades	 below,	 and	 far	 distant,	 from	 the	 scrub	 at	 the	 edge	 of	 the	 woods, pheasants	 were	 crowing.	 The	 morning	 sparkled,	 and,	 in	 a	 scene	 so	 fair,	 Henry found	 his	 spirits	 rise.	 Already	 the	 interview	 with	 Mary's	 husband	 on	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">preceding	night	seemed	remote	and	unreal.	He	was,	however,	conscious	that	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	made	an	ass	of	himself,	but	he	did	not	much	mind,	for	it	could	not	be	said</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	May	had	shone,	either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	called	him,	and,	for	reply,	an	old	spaniel	emerged	from	beneath,	climbed	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">flight	 of	 broad	 steps	 that	 ascended	 to	 the	 terrace,	 and	 paddled	 up	 to	 Henry, wagging	his	tail.	He	was	a	very	ancient	hero,	whose	record	among	the	wild	duck</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	remained	a	worthy	memory	and	won	him	honour	in	his	declining	days.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">age	of	"Prince"	remained	doubtful,	but	he	was	decrepit	now—gone	in	the	hams and	suffering	from	cataract	of	both	eyes—a	disease	to	which	it	is	impossible	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">minister	 in	 a	 dog.	 But	 his	 life	 was	 good	 to	 him;	 he	 still	 got	 about,	 slept	 in	 the sun,	and	shared	the	best	his	master's	dish	could	offer.	Sir	Walter	adored	him,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">immediately	 felt	 uneasy	 if	 the	 creature	 did	 not	 appear	 when	 summoned.	 Often, had	 he	 been	 invisible	 too	 long,	 his	 master	 would	 wander	 whistling	 round	 his haunts.	Then	he	would	find	him,	or	be	himself	found,	and	feel	easy	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Prince"	 went	 in	 to	 the	 open	 window	 of	 the	 breakfast-room,	 while	 Henry, moved	by	a	thought,	walked	round	the	eastern	angle	of	the	house	and	looked	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 the	 oriel	 window	 of	 the	 Grey	 Room,	 where	 it	 hung	 aloft	 on	 the	 side	 of	 the wall,	like	a	brilliant	bubble,	and	flashed	with	the	sunshine	that	now	irradiated	the casement.	 To	 his	 surprise	 he	 saw	 the	 window	 was	 thrown	 open	 and	 that	 May, still	 in	 his	 pyjamas,	 knelt	 on	 the	 cushioned	 recess	 within	 and	 looked	 out	 at	 the morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good	lord,	old	chap!"	he	cried,	"Needn't	ask	you	if	you	have	slept.	It's	nearly nine	o'clock." </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	the	other	made	no	response	whatever.	He	continued	to	gaze	far	away	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry's	head	at	the	sunrise,	while	the	morning	breeze	moved	his	dark	hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tom!	 Wake	 up!"	 shouted	 Lennox	 again;	 but	 still	 the	 other	 did	 not	 move	 a muscle.	Then	Henry	noticed	that	he	was	unusually	pale,	and	something	about	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">unwinking	eyes	also	seemed	foreign	to	an	intelligent	expression.	They	were	set, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	no	movement	of	light	played	upon	them.	It	seemed	that	the	watcher	was	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">trance.	Henry	felt	his	heart	jump,	and	a	sensation	of	alarm	sharpened	his	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 him	 the	 morning	 was	 suddenly	 transformed,	 and	 fearing	 an	 evil	 thing	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>indeed	befallen	the	other,	he	turned	to	the	terrace	and	entered	the	breakfast-room from	it.	The	time	was	now	five	minutes	to	nine,	and	as	unfailing	punctuality	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever	 been	 a	 foible	 of	 Sir	 Walter,	 his	 guests	 usually	 respected	 it.	 Most	 of	 them were	already	assembled,	and	Mary	May,	who	was	just	stepping	into	the	garden, </p>
<p class="calibre1">asked	Henry	if	he	had	seen	her	husband. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	always	the	first	to	get	up	and	the	last	to	go	to	bed,"	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bidding	 her	 good-morning,	 but	 not	 answering	 her	 question,	 the	 young	 man</p>
<p class="calibre1">hastened	 through	 the	 room	 and	 ascended	 to	 the	 corridor.	 Beneath,	 Ernest</p>
<p class="calibre1">Travers,	 a	 being	 of	 fussy	 temperament	 with	 a	 heart	 of	 gold,	 spoke	 to	 Colonel Vane.	Travers	was	clad	in	Sunday	black,	for	he	respected	tradition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Forgive	 me,	 won't	 you,	 but	 this	 is	 your	 first	 visit,	 and	 you	 don't	 look	 much like	church." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Must	 we	 go	 to	 church,	 too?"	 asked	 the	 colonel	 blankly.	 He	 was	 still	 a	 year under	forty,	but	had	achieved	distinction	in	the	war.	"There	is	no	'must'	about	it, but	Sir	Walter	would	appreciate	the	effort	on	your	part.	He	likes	his	guests	to	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 is	 one	 of	 those	 men	 who	 are	 a	 light	 to	 this	 generation—an	 ancient	 light,	 if you	 like,	 but	 a	 shining	 one.	 He	 loves	 sound	 maxims.	 You	 may	 say	 he	 runs	 his life	on	sound	maxims.	He	lives	charitably	with	all	men	and	it	puzzles	him,	as	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">puzzles	 me,	 to	 understand	 the	 growing	 doubt,	 the	 class	 prejudice—nay,	 class hatred	 the	 failure	 of	 trust	 and	 the	 increasing	 tension	 and	 uneasiness	 between employer	and	employed.	He	and	I	are	agreed	that	the	tribulations	of	the	present</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	can	be	traced	to	two	disasters	only—the	lack	of	goodwill—as	shown	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">proletariat,	whose	leaders	teach	them	to	respect	nobody,	and	the	weakening	hold</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 religion	 as	 also	 revealed	 in	 the	 proletariat.	 Now,	 to	 combat	 these	 things	 and set	a	good	example	is	our	duty—nay,	our	privilege.	Don't	you	think	so?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such	a	lecture	on	an	empty	stomach	depressed	the	colonel.	He	looked	uneasy</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	anxious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	come,	of	course,	if	he'd	like	it;	but	I'm	afraid	I	shared	my	men's	dread	of church	 parade,	 though	 our	 padre	 was	 a	 merciful	 being	 on	 the	 whole	 and	 fairly sensible." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Overhead,	 Henry	 had	 tried	 the	 door	 of	 the	 Grey	 Room,	 and	 found	 it	 locked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	did	so,	the	gong	sounded	for	breakfast.	Masters	always	performed	upon	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First	he	woke	a	preliminary	whisper	of	the	great	bronze	disc,	then	deepened	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">note	to	a	genial	and	mellow	roar,	and	finally	calmed	it	down	again	until	it	faded</p>
<p class="calibre1">gently	into	silence.	He	spoke	of	the	gong	as	a	musical	instrument,	and	declared</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	art	of	sounding	it	was	a	gift	that	few	men	could	acquire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neither	movement	nor	response	rewarded	the	summons	of	Lennox,	and	now</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>in	genuine	alarm,	he	went	below	again,	stopped	Fred	Caunter,	the	footman,	and asked	him	to	call	out	Sir	Walter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fred	 waited	 until	 his	 master	 had	 said	 a	 brief	 grace	 before	 meat;	 then	 he stepped	to	his	side	and	explained,	that	his	nephew	desired	to	see	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good	patience!	What's	the	matter?"	asked	the	old	man	as	he	rose	and	joined Henry	in	the	hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 his	 nephew	 spoke,	 and	 indicated	 his	 alarm.	 He	 stammered	 a	 little,	 but strove	to	keep	calm	and	state	facts	clearly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	like	this.	I'm	afraid	you'll	be	rather	savage,	but	I	can't	talk	now.	Tom	and	I had	a	yarn	when	you'd	gone	to	bed,	and	he	was	awfully	keen	to	spend	the	night</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	Grey	Room." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	did	not	wish	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	know—we	were	wrong—but	we	were	both	death	on	it,	and	we	tossed	up, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	he	won." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where	is	he?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Up	there	now,	looking	out	of	the	window.	I've	called	him	and	made	a	row	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	door,	but	he	doesn't	answer.	He's	locked	himself	in,	apparently." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	have	you	done,	Henry?	We	must	get	to	him	instantly.	Tell	Caunter—no, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	will.	Don't	breathe	a	syllable	of	this	to	anybody	unless	necessity	arises.	Don't</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell	Mary." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter	beckoned	the	footman,	bade	him	get	some	tools	and	ascend	quickly</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	Grey	Room.	He	then	went	up	beside	his	nephew,	while	Fred,	bristling	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">excitement,	 hastened	 to	 the	 toolroom.	 He	 was	 a	 handy	 man,	 had	 been	 at	 sea during	the	war,	and	now	returned	to	his	old	employment.	His	slow	brain	moved</p>
<p class="calibre1">backwards,	and	he	remembered	that	this	was	a	task	he	had	already	performed	ten</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	more	years	before.	Then	the	ill-omened	chamber	had	revealed	a	dead	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Who	was	in	it	now?	Caunter	guessed	readily	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lennox	spoke	to	his	uncle	as	they	approached	the	locked	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	was	only	a	lark,	just	to	clear	the	room	of	its	bad	character	and	have	a	laugh at	your	expense	this	morning.	But	I'm	afraid	he's	ill—fainted	or	something.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned	in	about	one	o'clock.	I	was	rather	bothered,	and	couldn't	explain	to	myself</p>
<p class="calibre1">why,	but—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	chatter!"	answered	the	other.	"You	have	both	done	a	very	wrong	thing and	should	have	respected	my	wishes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	door	he	called	loudly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>"Let	 us	 in	 at	 once,	 Tom,	 please!	 I	 am	 much	 annoyed!	 If	 this	 is	 a	 jest,	 it	 has gone	far	enough—and	too	far!	I	blame	you	severely!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	none	replied.	Absolute	silence	held	the	Grey	Room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	came	the	footman	with	a	frail	of	tools.	The	task	could	not	be	performed</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	a	moment,	and	Sir	Walter,	desirous	above	all	things	to	create	no	uneasiness	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 breakfast-table,	 determined	 to	 go	 down	 again.	 But	 he	 was	 too	 late,	 for	 his daughter	had	already	suspected	something.	She	was	not	anxious	but	puzzled	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	husband	tarried.	She	came	up	the	stairs	with	a	letter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	 going	 to	 find	 Tom,"	 she	 said.	 "It's	 not	 like	 him	 to	 be	 so	 lazy.	 Here's	 a letter	from	the	ship,	and	I'm	awfully	afraid	he	may	have	to	go	back." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mary,"	said	her	father,	"come	here	a	moment." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	drew	her	under	a	great	window	which	threw	light	into	the	corridor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	must	summon	your	nerve	and	pluck,	my	girl!	I'm	very	much	afraid	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	has	gone	amiss	with	Tom.	I	know	nothing	yet,	but	last	night,	it	seems, </p>
<p class="calibre1">after	we	had	gone	to	bed,	he	and	Henry	determined	that	one	of	them	should	sleep</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	Grey	Room." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Father!	Was	he	there,	and	I	so	near	him—sleeping	in	the	very	next	room?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	was	there—and	is	there.	He	is	not	well.	Henry	saw	him	looking	out	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">window	five	minutes	ago,	but	he	was,	I	fear,	unconscious." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let	me	go	to	him,"	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	will	do	so	first.	It	will	be	wiser.	Run	down	and	ask	Ernest	to	join	me.	Do</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	be	alarmed;	I	dare	say	it	is	nothing	at	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 habit	 of	 obedience	 prompted	 her	 to	 do	 as	 he	 desired	 instantly,	 but	 she descended	like	lightning,	called	Travers,	and	returned	with	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	will	ask	you	to	come	in	with	me,	Ernest,"	explained	Sir	Walter.	"My	son-in-law	slept	in	the	Grey	Room	last	night,	and	he	does	not	respond	to	our	calls	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">morning.	The	door	is	locked	and	we	are	breaking	it	open." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	you	expressly	refused	him	permission	to	do	so,	Walter." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	did—you	heard	me.	Let	sleeping	dogs	lie	is	a	very	good	motto,	but	young</p>
<p class="calibre1">men	will	be	young	men.	I	hope,	however,	nothing	serious—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stopped,	for	Caunter	had	forced	the	door	and	burst	it	inward	with	a	crash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During	 the	 moment's	 silence	 that	 followed	 they	 heard	 the	 key	 spring	 into	 the room	and	strike	the	wainscot.	The	place	was	flooded	with	sunshine,	and	seemed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 welcome	 them	 with	 genial	 light	 and	 attractive	 art.	 The	 furniture	 revealed	 its rich	 grain	 and	 beautiful	 modelling;	 the	 cherubs	 carved	 on	 the	 great	 chairs</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>seemed	 to	 dance	 where	 the	 light	 flashed	 on	 their	 little,	 rounded	 limbs.	 The silvery	walls	were	bright,	and	the	huge	roses	that	tumbled	over	them	appeared	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">revive	and	display	their	original	color	at	the	touch	of	the	sun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 a	 chair	 beside	 the	 bed	 stood	 an	 extinguished	 candle,	 Tom's	 watch,	 and Henry's	 revolver.	 The	 sailor's	 dressing-gown	 was	 still	 folded	 where	 he	 had placed	it;	his	rug	was	at	the	foot	of	the	bed.	He	himself	knelt	in	the	recess	at	the open	window	upon	the	settee	that	ran	beneath.	His	position	was	natural;	one	arm</p>
<p class="calibre1">held	the	window-ledge	and	steadied	him,	and	his	back	was	turned	to	Sir	Walter</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	Travers,	who	first	entered	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	held	Mary	back	and	implored	her	to	wait	a	moment,	but	she	shook	off</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	hand	and	followed	her	father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	 Walter	 it	 was	 who	 approached	 Tom	 and	 grasped	 his	 arm.	 In	 so	 doing	 he disturbed	 the	 balance	 of	 the	 body,	 which	 fell	 back	 and	 was	 caught	 by	 the	 two men.	Its	weight	bore	Ernest	Travers	to	the	ground,	but	Henry	was	in	time	to	save</p>
<p class="calibre1">both	the	quick	and	the	dead.	For	Tom	May	had	expired	many	hours	before.	His</p>
<p class="calibre1">face	was	of	an	ivory	whiteness,	his	mouth	closed.	No	sign	of	fear,	but	rather	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">profound	astonishment	sat	upon	his	features.	His	eyes	were	opened	and	dim.	In</p>
<p class="calibre1">them,	 too,	 was	 frozen	 a	 sort	 of	 speechless	 amazement.	 How	 long	 he	 had	 been dead	they	knew	not,	but	none	were	in	doubt	of	the	fact.	His	wife,	too,	perceived</p>
<p class="calibre1">it.	She	went	to	where	he	now	lay,	put	her	arms	around	his	neck,	and	fainted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Others	 were	 moving	 outside,	 and	 the	 murmur	 of	 voices	 reached	 the	 Grey</p>
<p class="calibre1">Room.	 It	 was	 one	 of	 those	 tragic	 situations	 when	 everybody	 desires	 to	 be	 of service,	 and	 when	 well-meaning	 and	 small-minded	 people	 are	 often	 hurt</p>
<p class="calibre1">unintentionally	and	never	forget	it,	putting	fancied	affronts	before	the	incidents</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	caused	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	lay	dead	and	his	wife	unconscious	upon	his	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter	rose	to	the	occasion	as	best	he	might,	issued	orders,	and	begged	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">who	heard	him	to	obey	without	question.	He	and	his	friend	Travers	lifted	Mary</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	carried	her	to	her	room.	It	was	her	nursery	of	old.	Here	they	put	her	on	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">bed,	and	sent	Caunter	for	Mrs.	Travers	and	Mary's	old	servant,	Jane	Bond.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	recovered	consciousness	before	the	women	reached	her.	Then	they	returned</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	dead,	and	the	master	of	Chadlands	urged	those	standing	on	the	stairs	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	corridor	to	go	back	to	their	breakfast	and	their	duties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	can	do	no	good,"	he	said.	"I	will	only	ask	Vane	to	help	us." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fayre-Michell	spoke,	while	the	colonel	came	forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Forgive	me,	Sir	Walter,	but	if	it	is	anything	psychical,	I	ask,	as	a	member—" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>"For	Heaven's	sake	do	as	I	wish,"	returned	the	other.	"My	son-in-law	is	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	 more	 there	 is	 to	 know,	 you'll	 hear	 later.	 I	 want	 Vane,	 because	 he	 is	 a powerful	man	and	can	help	Henry	and	my	butler.	We	have	to	carry—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	broke	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Dead!"	gasped	the	visitor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he	hastened	downstairs.	Presently	they	lifted	the	sailor	among	them,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">got	him	to	his	own	room.	They	could	not	dispose	him	in	a	comely	position—a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fact	that	specially	troubled	Sir	Walter—and	Masters	doubted	not	that	the	doctor</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	be	able	to	do	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	 Lennox	 started	 as	 swiftly	 as	 possible	 for	 the	 house	 of	 the	 physician, four	miles	off.	He	took	a	small	motor-car,	did	the	journey	along	empty	roads	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">twelve	 minutes,	 and	 was	 back	 again	 with	 Dr.	 Mannering	 in	 less	 than	 half	 an hour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 people,	 whose	 visit	 of	 pleasure	 was	 thus	 painfully	 brought	 to	 a	 close, moved	 about	 whispering	 on	 the	 terrace.	 They	 had	 as	 yet	 heard	 no	 details,	 and were	considering	whether	it	would	be	possible	to	get	off	at	once,	or	necessary	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">wait	until	the	morrow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	natural	desire	was	to	depart,	since	they	could	not	be	of	any	service	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">stricken	 household;	 but	 no	 facilities	 existed	 on	 Sunday.	 They	 walked	 about	 in little	 groups.	 One	 or	 two,	 desiring	 to	 smoke	 but	 feeling	 that	 to	 do	 so	 would appear	callous,	descended	into	the	seclusion	of	the	garden.	Then	Ernest	Travers</p>
<p class="calibre1">joined	them.	He	was	important,	but	could	only	tell	them	that	May	had	disobeyed</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	father-in-law,	slept	in	the	Grey	Room,	and	died	there.	He	gave	them	details</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 declared	 that	 in	 his	 opinion	 it	 would	 be	 unseemly	 to	 attempt	 to	 leave	 until the	following	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sir	Walter	would	feel	it,"	he	said.	"He	is	bearing	up	well.	He	will	lunch	with us.	 My	 wife	 tells	 me	 that	 Mary,	 Mrs.	 May,	 is	 very	 sadly.	 That	 is	 natural—an awful	blow.	I	find	myself	incapable	of	grasping	it.	To	think	of	so	much	boyish</p>
<p class="calibre1">good	spirits	and	such	vitality	extinguished	in	this	way." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can	we	do	anything	on	earth	for	them?"	asked	Millicent	Fayre-Michell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothing—nothing.	If	I	may	advise,	I	think	we	had	all	better	go	to	church.	By</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	 doing	 we	 get	 out	 of	 the	 way	 for	 a	 time	 and	 please	 dear	 Sir	 Walter.	 I	 shall certainly	go." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 greeted	 the	 suggestion—indeed,	 clutched	 at	 it.	 Their	 bewildered	 minds</p>
<p class="calibre1">welcomed	 action.	 They	 were	 hushed	 and	 perturbed.	 Death,	 crashing	 in	 upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	 thus,	 left	 them	 more	 than	 uncomfortable.	 Some,	 at	 the	 bottom	 of	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>souls,	 felt	 almost	 indignant	 that	 an	 event	 so	 horrible	 should	 have	 disturbed	 the level	 tenor	 of	 their	 lives.	 They	 shared	 the	 most	 profound	 sympathy	 for	 the sufferers	 as	 well	 as	 for	 themselves.	 Some	 discovered	 that	 their	 own	 physical bodies	were	upset,	too,	and	felt	surprised	at	the	depth	of	their	emotions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	 isn't	 as	 if	 it	 were	 natural,"	 Felix	 Fayre-Michell	 persisted.	 "Don't	 imagine that	for	a	moment." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	too	creepy—I	can't	believe	it,"	declared	his	niece.	She	was	incapable	of suffering	much	for	anybody,	and	her	excitement	had	a	flavour	not	wholly	bitter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	saw	herself	describing	these	events	at	other	house	parties.	It	would	be	unfair</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 say	 that	 she	 was	 enjoying	 herself;	 still	 she	 knew	 nobody	 at	 Chadlands	 very well,	 it	 was	 her	 first	 visit,	 and	 adventures	 are,	 after	 all,	 adventures.	 Her	 uncle discussed	the	psychic	significance	of	the	tragedy,	and	gave	instances	of	similar</p>
<p class="calibre1">events.	One	or	two	listened	to	him	for	lack	of	anything	better	to	do.	There	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">general	 sensation	 of	 blankness.	 They	 were	 all	 thrown.	 Life	 had	 let	 them	 down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under	 the	 circumstances,	 to	 most	 of	 them	 it	 seemed	 an	 excellent	 idea	 to	 go	 to church.	Vane	joined	them	presently.	He	was	able	to	give	them	many	details	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">excite	their	interest.	They	crowded	round	him,	and	he	spoke	nakedly.	Death	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing	 to	 him—he	 had	 seen	 so	 much.	 They	 heard	 the	 motor	 return	 with	 Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mannering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We're	so	out	of	it,"	said	Mr.	Miles	Handford,	a	stout	man	from	Yorkshire—a wealthy	landowner	and	sportsman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 was	 unaccustomed	 to	 be	 out	 of	 anything	 in	 his	 environment,	 and	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">showed	actual	irritation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank	 Heaven	 we	 are,	 I	 should	 think!"	 answered	 another;	 and	 the	 first speaker	frowned	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ernest	 Travers	 joined	 them	 presently.	 He	 had	 put	 on	 a	 black	 tie	 and	 wore black	gloves	and	a	silk	hat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	 you	 accompany	 me,"	 he	 said,	 "I	 can	 show	 you	 the	 short	 way	 by	 a	 field path.	 It	 cuts	 off	 half	 a	 mile.	 I	 have	 told	 Sir	 Walter	 we	 all	 go	 to	 church,	 and	 he asked	me	if	we	would	like	the	motors;	but	I	felt,	the	day	being	fine,	you	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">agree	with	me	that	we	might	walk.	He	is	terribly	crushed,	but	taking	it	like	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	he	is." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miles	Handford	and	Fayre-Michell	followed	the	church	party	in	the	rear,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">relieved	their	minds	by	criticizing	Mr.	Travers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Officious	ass!"	said	the	stout	man.	"A	typical	touch	that	black	tie!	A	decent-minded	 person	 would	 have	 felt	 this	 appalling	 tragedy	 far	 too	 much	 to	 think	 of such	a	trifle.	I	hope	I	shall	never	see	the	brute	again." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>"It	seems	too	grotesque	marching	to	church	like	a	lot	of	children,	because	he tells	us	to	do	so,"	murmured	Fayre-Michell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 don't	 want	 to	 go.	 I	 only	 want	 distraction.	 In	 fact,	 I	 don't	 think	 I	 shall	 go," </p>
<p class="calibre1">added	Mr.	Handford.	But	a	woman	urged	him	to	do	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sir	Walter	would	like	it,"	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	 all	 very	 sad	 and	 very	 exasperating	 indeed,"	 declared	 the	 Yorkshireman; </p>
<p class="calibre1">"and	 it	 shows,	 if	 that	 wanted	 showing,	 that	 there's	 far,	 far	 less	 consideration among	young	men	for	their	elders	than	there	used	to	be	in	my	young	days.	If	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">father-in-law	 had	 told	 me	 not	 to	 do	 a	 thing,	 the	 very	 wish	 to	 do	 it	 would	 have disappeared	at	once." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sir	Walter	was	as	clear	as	need	be,"	added	Felix.	"We	all	heard	him.	Then	the young	fool—Heaven	forgive	him—behind	everybody's	back	goes	and	plays	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">fire	in	this	insane	way." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	selfishness!	Just	look	at	the	inconvenience—the	upset—the	suffering	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 relations	 and	 the	 worry	 for	 all	 of	 us.	 All	 our	 plans	 must	 be	 altered—</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything	 upset,	 life	 for	 the	 moment	 turned	 upside	 down—a	 woman's	 heart</p>
<p class="calibre1">broken	 very	 likely—and	 all	 for	 a	 piece	 of	 disobedient	 folly.	 Such	 things	 make one	out	of	tune	with	Providence.	They	oughtn't	to	happen.	They	don't	happen	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Yorkshire.	 Devonshire	 appears	 to	 be	 a	 slacker's	 county.	 It's	 the	 air,	 I	 shouldn't wonder." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Education,	and	law	and	order,	and	the	discipline	inculcated	in	the	Navy	ought</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 have	 prevented	 this,"	 continued	 Fayre-Michell.	 "Who	 ever	 heard	 of	 a	 sailor disobeying—except	Nelson?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	paid,	poor	fellow,"	said	his	niece,	who	walked	beside	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	 have	 all	 paid,"	 declared	 the	 north	 countryman.	 "We	 have	 all	 paid	 the price;	and	the	price	has	been	a	great	deal	of	suffering	and	discomfort	and	stress</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 mind	 that	 we	 ought	 not	 have	 been	 called	 upon	 to	 endure.	 One	 resents	 such things	in	a	stable	world." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	 I'm	 not	 going	 to	 church,	 anyway.	 I	 must	 smoke	 for	 my	 nerves.	 I'm	 a psychic	myself,	and	I	react	to	a	thing	of	this	sort,"	replied	Fayre-Michell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	 a	 distant	 stile	 between	 two	 fields	 Mr.	 Travers,	 some	 hundred	 yards</p>
<p class="calibre1">ahead,	was	waving	directions	and	pointing	to	the	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Go	 to	 Jericho!"	 snapped	 Mr.	 Handford,	 but	 not	 loud	 enough	 for	 Ernest Travers	to	hear	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	little	ring	of	bells	throbbed	thin	music.	It	rose	and	fell	on	the	easterly	breeze</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 a	 squat	 grey	 tower,	 over	 which	 floated	 a	 white	 ensign	 on	 a	 flagstaff, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>appeared	upon	a	little	knoll	of	trees	in	the	midst	of	the	village	of	Chadlands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Presently	the	bells	stopped,	and	the	flag	was	brought	down	to	half-mast.	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Travers	had	reached	the	church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	 maddening	 sort	 of	 man,"	 said	 Miles	 Handford,	 who	 marked	 these phenomena.	 "Be	 sure	 Sir	 Walter	 never	 told	 him	 to	 do	 anything	 of	 that	 sort.	 He has	taken	it	upon	himself—a	theatrical	mind.	If	I	were	the	vicar—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elsewhere	 Dr.	 Mannering	 heard	 what	 Henry	 Lennox	 could	 tell	 him	 as	 they</p>
<p class="calibre1">returned	to	the	manor	house	together.	He	displayed	very	deep	concern	combined</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	professional	interest.	He	recalled	the	story	that	Sir	Walter	had	related	on	the previous	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	 a	 shadow	 of	 evidence—a	 perfectly	 healthy	 little	 woman;	 and	 it	 will	 be the	 same	 here	 as	 sure	 as	 I'm	 alive,"	 he	 said.	 "To	 think—we	 shot	 side	 by	 side yesterday,	 and	 I	 remarked	 his	 fine	 physique	 and	 wonderful	 high	 spirits—a	 big, tough	fellow.	How's	poor	Mary?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	 is	 pretty	 bad,	 but	 keeping	 her	 nerve,	 as	 she	 would	 be	 sure	 to	 do," </p>
<p class="calibre1">declared	the	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	 Walter	 was	 with	 his	 daughter	 when	 Mannering	 arrived.	 The	 doctor	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	a	crony	of	the	elder	for	many	years.	He	was	about	the	average	of	a	country</p>
<p class="calibre1">physician—a	 hard-bitten,	 practical	 man	 who	 loved	 his	 profession,	 loved	 sport, and	 professed	 conservative	 principles.	 Experience	 stood	 in	 place	 of	 high</p>
<p class="calibre1">qualifications,	 but	 he	 kept	 in	 touch	 with	 medical	 progress,	 to	 the	 extent	 of reading	 about	 it	 and	 availing	 himself	 of	 improved	 methods	 and	 preparations when	 opportunity	 offered.	 He	 examined	 the	 dead	 man	 very	 carefully,	 indicated how	 his	 posture	 might	 be	 rendered	 more	 normal,	 and	 satisfied	 himself	 that human	power	was	incapable	of	restoring	the	vanished	life.	He	could	discover	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">visible	indication	of	violence	and	no	apparent	excuse	for	Tom	May's	sudden	end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	listened	with	attention	to	the	little	that	Henry	Lennox	could	tell	him,	and	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">went	to	see	Mary	May	and	her	father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 young	 wife	 had	 grown	 more	 collected,	 but	 she	 was	 dazed	 rather	 than</p>
<p class="calibre1">reconciled	 to	 her	 fate;	 her	 mind	 had	 not	 yet	 absorbed	 the	 full	 extent	 of	 her sorrow.	 She	 talked	 incessantly	 and	 dwelt	 on	 trivialities,	 as	 people	 will	 under	 a weight	of	events	too	large	to	measure	or	discuss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	am	going	to	write	to	Tom's	father,"	she	said.	"This	will	be	an	awful	blow	to him.	 He	 was	 wrapped	 up	 in	 Tom.	 And	 to	 think	 that	 I	 was	 troubling	 about	 his letter!	He	will	never	see	the	sea	he	loved	so	much	again.	He	always	hated	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">verse	in	the	Bible	that	says	there	will	be	no	more	sea.	I	was	asleep	so	near	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">last	night.	Yet	I	never	heard	him	cry	out	or	anything." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>Mannering	talked	gently	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Be	sure	he	did	not	cry	out.	He	felt	no	pain,	no	shock—I	am	sure	of	that.	To</p>
<p class="calibre1">die	is	no	hardship	to	the	dead,	remember.	He	is	at	peace,	Mary.	You	must	come</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 see	 him	 presently.	 Your	 father	 will	 call	 you	 soon.	 There	 is	 just	 a	 look	 of wonder	in	his	face—no	fear,	no	suffering.	Keep	that	in	mind." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	could	not	have	felt	fear.	He	knew	of	nothing	that	a	brave	man	might	fear, </p>
<p class="calibre1">except	doing	wrong.	Nobody	knows	how	good	he	was	but	me.	His	father	loved</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	 fiercely,	 passionately;	 but	 he	 never	 knew	 how	 good	 he	 was,	 because	 Tom did	 not	 think	 quite	 like	 old	 Mr.	 May.	 I	 must	 write	 and	 say	 that	 Tom	 is dangerously	ill,	and	cannot	recover.	That	will	break	it	to	him.	Tom	was	the	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">earthly	affection	he	had.	It	will	be	terrible	when	he	comes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 left	 her,	 and,	 after	 they	 had	 gone,	 she	 rose,	 fell	 on	 her	 knees,	 and	 so remained,	motionless	and	tearless,	for	a	long	time.	Through	her	own	desolation, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 yet	 unrealized,	 there	 still	 persisted	 the	 thought	 of	 her	 husband's	 father.	 It seemed	that	her	mind	could	dwell	on	his	isolation,	while	powerless	to	present	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">truth	 of	 her	 husband's	 death	 to	 her.	 By	 some	 strange	 mental	 operation,	 not unbeneficent,	 she	 saw	 his	 grief	 more	 vividly	 than	 as	 yet	 she	 felt	 her	 own.	 She rose	presently,	quick-eared	to	wait	the	call,	and	went	to	her	desk	in	the	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	she	wrote	a	letter	to	her	father-in-law,	and	pictured	his	ministering	at	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment	to	his	church.	Her	inclination	was	to	soften	the	blow,	yet	she	knew	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 only	 be	 a	 cruel	 kindness.	 She	 told	 him,	 therefore,	 that	 his	 son	 must	 die. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 she	 remembered	 that	 he	 was	 so	 near.	 A	 telegram	 must	 go	 rather	 than	 a letter,	 and	 he	 would	 be	 at	 Chadlands	 before	 nightfall.	 She	 destroyed	 her	 letter and	set	about	a	telegram.	Jane	Bond	came	in,	and	she	asked	her	to	dispatch	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">telegram	 as	 quickly	 as	 possible.	 Her	 old	 nurse,	 an	 elderly	 spinster,	 to	 whom Mary	was	the	first	consideration	in	existence,	had	brought	her	a	cup	of	soup	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	toast.	It	had	seemed	to	Jane	the	right	thing	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary	thanked	her	and	drank	a	little.	She	passed	through	a	mental	phase	as	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">dreaming—a	 sensation	 familiar	 in	 sleep;	 but	 she	 knew	 that	 this	 was	 not	 a sleeping	but	a	waking	experience.	She	waited	for	her	father,	yet	dreaded	to	hear</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	 return.	 She	 thought	 of	 human	 footsteps	 and	 the	 difference	 between	 them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	remembered	that	she	would	never	hear	Tom's	long	stride	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 often	 broke	 into	 a	 run,	 she	 remembered,	 as	 he	 approached	 her;	 and	 she would	often	run	toward	him,	too—to	banish	the	space	that	separated	them.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">blamed	herself	bitterly	that	she	had	decreed	to	sleep	in	her	old	nursery.	She	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">loved	it	so,	and	the	small	bed	that	had	held	her	from	childhood;	yet,	if	she	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">slept	with	him,	this	might	not	have	happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>"To	 think	 that	 only	 a	 wall	 separated	 us!"	 she	 kept	 saying	 to	 herself.	 "And	 I sleeping	and	dreaming	of	him,	and	he	dying	only	a	few	yards	away." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Death	 was	 no	 disaster	 for	 Tom,	 so	 the	 doctor	 had	 said.	 What	 worthless</p>
<p class="calibre1">wisdom!	And	perhaps	not	even	wisdom.	Who	knows	what	a	disaster	death	may</p>
<p class="calibre1">be?	And	who	would	ever	know	what	he	had	felt	at	the	end,	or	what	his	mind	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">suffered	if	time	had	been	given	him	to	understand	that	he	was	going	to	die?	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">worked	 herself	 into	 agony,	 lost	 self-control	 at	 last	 and	 wept,	 with	 Jane	 Bond's arms	round	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	 I	 was	 so	 troubled,	 because	 I	 thought	 he	 had	 been	 called	 back	 to	 his ship!"	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	called	to	a	better	place	than	a	ship,	dear	love,"	sobbed	Jane. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	they	left	her,	Sir	Walter	and	Dr.	Mannering	had	entered	the	Grey	Room</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	a	moment	and,	standing	there,	spoke	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	have	a	strange	consciousness	that	I	am	living	over	the	past	again,"	declared the	 physician.	 "Things	 were	 just	 so	 when	 that	 poor	 woman,	 Nurse	 Forrester—</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	remember." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes.	 I	 felt	 the	 same	 when	 Caunter	 was	 breaking	 open	 the	 door.	 I	 faced	 the worst	from	the	beginning,	for	the	moment	I	heard	what	he	had	done,	I	somehow</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew	 that	 my	 unfortunate	 son-in-law	 was	 dead.	 I	 directly	 negatived	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">suggestion	 last	 night,	 and	 never	 dreamed	 that	 he	 would	 have	 gone	 on	 with	 it when	he	knew	my	wish." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Doubtless	 he	 did	 not	 realize	 how	 much	 in	 earnest	 you	 were	 on	 the	 subject. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 may	 well	 prove	 as	 impossible	 to	 understand	 as	 the	 nurse's	 death.	 I	 do	 not say	it	will;	but	I	suspect	it	will.	A	perfectly	healthy	creature	cut	off	in	a	moment and	nothing	to	show	us	why—absolutely	nothing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	death	without	a	cause—a	negation	of	science	surely?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	 is	 a	 cause,	 but	 I	 do	 not	 think	 this	 dreadful	 tragedy	 will	 reveal	 it," </p>
<p class="calibre1">answered	the	doctor.	"I	pray	it	may,	however,	for	all	our	sakes,"	he	continued.	"It is	impossible	to	say	how	deeply	I	feel	this	for	her,	but	also	for	you,	and	myself, </p>
<p class="calibre1">too.	He	was	one	of	the	best,	a	good	sportsman	and	a	good	man." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	a	great	loss	to	the	Service,"	added	Sir	Walter.	"I	have	not	considered	all this	means	yet.	My	thoughts	are	centred	on	Mary." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	must	let	me	spare	you	all	I	can,	my	friend.	There	will	be	an	inquest,	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">course,	 and	 an	 inquiry.	 Also	 a	 post-mortem.	 Shall	 I	 communicate	 with	 Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mordred	to-day,	or	would	you	prefer	that	somebody	else—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Somebody	else.	The	most	famous	man	you	know.	From	no	disrespect	to	Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>Mordred,	 or	 to	 you,	 Mannering.	 You	 understand	 that.	 But	 I	 should	 like	 an independent	examination	by	some	great	authority,	some	one	who	knew	nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	former	case.	This	is	an	appalling	thing	to	happen.	I	don't	know	where	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">begin	thinking." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	not	put	too	great	a	strain	upon	yourself.	Leave	it	to	those	who	will	come</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 matter	 with	 all	 their	 wits	 and	 without	 your	 personal	 sorrow.	 An</p>
<p class="calibre1">independent	inquirer	is	certainly	best,	one	who,	as	you	say,	knows	nothing	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	former	case." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 don't	 know	 where	 to	 begin	 thinking,"	 repeated	 the	 other.	 "Such	 a	 thing upsets	 one's	 preconceived	 opinions.	 I	 had	 always	 regarded	 my	 aversion	 to	 this room	as	a	human	weakness—a	thing	to	be	conquered.	Look	round	you.	Would	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	possible	to	imagine	an	apartment	with	less	of	evil	suggestion?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	other	made	a	perfunctory	examination,	went	into	every	corner,	tapped	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">walls	 and	 stared	 at	 the	 ceiling.	 The	 clean	 morning	 light	 showed	 its	 intricate pattern	 of	 interwoven	 circles	 converging	 from	 the	 walls	 to	 the	 centre,	 and	 so creating	a	sense	of	a	lofty	dome	instead	of	a	flat	surface.	In	the	centre	was	a	boss of	a	conventional	lily	flower	opening	its	petals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	room	should	not	be	touched	till	after	the	inquest,	I	think.	Indeed,	if	I	may advise,	you	will	do	well	to	leave	it	just	as	it	is	for	the	police	to	see." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	will	want	to	see	it,	I	imagine?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Unless	you	communicate	direct	with	Scotland	Yard,	ask	for	a	special	inquiry, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 beg	 that	 the	 local	 men	 are	 not	 employed.	 There	 is	 reason	 in	 that,	 for	 it	 is quite	certain	that	nobody	here	would	be	of	any	greater	use	to	you	than	they	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">before." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Act	 for	 me	 then,	 please.	 Explain	 that	 money	 is	 no	 object,	 and	 ask	 them	 to send	 the	 most	 accomplished	 and	 experienced	 men	 in	 the	 service.	 But	 they	 are only	concerned	with	crime.	This	may	be	outside	their	scope." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	cannot	say	as	to	that.	We	cannot	even	assert	that	this	is	not	a	crime.	We</p>
<p class="calibre1">know	nothing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	crime	needs	a	criminal,	Mannering." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	is	so;	but	what	would	be	criminal,	if	human	agency	were	responsible	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">it,	might,	nevertheless,	be	the	work	of	forces	to	which	the	word	criminal	cannot</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	applied." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter	stared	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	it	possible	you	suggest	a	supernatural	cause	for	this?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	doctor	shook	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>"Emphatically	 not,	 though	 I	 am	 not	 a	 materialist,	 as	 you	 are	 aware.	 My generation	of	practitioners	has	little	difficulty	in	reconciling	our	creed	with	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">cult,	 though	 few	 of	 the	 younger	 men	 are	 able	 to	 do	 so,	 I	 admit.	 But	 science	 is science,	and	not	for	a	moment	do	I	imagine	anything	supernatural	here.	I	think, </p>
<p class="calibre1">however,	there	are	unconscious	forces	at	work,	and	those	responsible	for	setting</p>
<p class="calibre1">those	 forces	 in	 action	 would	 be	 criminals	 without	 a	 doubt,	 if	 they	 knew	 what they	were	doing.	The	man	who	fires	a	rifle	at	an	animal,	if	he	hits	and	kills	it,	is the	destroyer,	though	he	may	operate	from	half	a	mile	away.	On	the	other	hand, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	agents	may	be	unconscious	of	what	they	are	doing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	is	no	human	being	in	this	house	for	whom	I	would	not	answer." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 know	 it.	 We	 beat	 the	 wind.	 It	 will	 be	 time	 enough	 to	 consider	 presently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed,	I	should	rather	that	you	strove	to	relieve	your	mind	of	the	problem.	You</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	enough	to	do	without	that.	Leave	it	to	those	professionally	trained	in	such</p>
<p class="calibre1">mysteries.	 If	 a	 man	 is	 responsible	 for	 this	 atrocious	 thing,	 then	 it	 should	 be within	 the	 reach	 of	 man's	 wits	 to	 find	 him.	 We	 failed	 before;	 but	 this	 time	 no casual	examination	of	this	place,	or	the	antecedents	of	your	son-in-law's	life,	will serve	the	purpose.	We	must	go	to	the	bottom,	or,	rather,	skilled	minds,	trained	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	 so,	 must	 go	 to	 the	 bottom.	 They	 will	 approach	 the	 subject	 from	 a	 different angle.	They	will	come	unprejudiced	and	unperturbed.	If	there	has	been	foul	play, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they	will	find	it	out.	In	my	opinion	it	is	incredible	that	they	will	be	baffled." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 best	 men	 engaged	 in	 such	 work	 must	 come	 to	 help	 us.	 I	 cannot	 bring myself	 to	 believe	 the	 room	 is	 haunted,	 and	 that	 this	 is	 the	 operation	 of	 an	 evil force	 outside	 Nature,	 yet	 permitted	 by	 the	 Creator	 to	 destroy	 human	 life.	 The idea	is	too	horrible—it	revolts	me,	Mannering." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	it	may	do	so.	Banish	any	such	irrational	thought	from	your	mind.	It	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 worthy	 of	 you.	 I	 must	 go	 now.	 I	 will	 telegraph	 to	 London—to	 Sir	 Howard Fellowes—also,	 I	 think	 to	 the	 State	 authorities	 on	 forensic	 medicine.	 A</p>
<p class="calibre1">Government	 analyst	 must	 do	 his	 part.	 Shall	 I	 communicate	 with	 Scotland	 Yard to-day?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Leave	that	until	the	evening.	You	will	come	again	to	see	Mary,	please." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Most	certainly	I	shall.	At	three	o'clock	I	should	have	a	reply	to	my	messages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	will	go	into	Newton	Abbot	and	telephone	from	there." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	thank	you,	Mannering.	I	wish	it	were	possible	to	do	more	myself.	My	mind</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	cruelly	shaken.	This	awful	experience	has	made	an	old	man	of	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	 say	 that.	 It	 is	 awful	 enough,	 I	 admit.	 But	 life	 is	 full	 of	 awful	 things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Would	that	you	might	have	escaped	them!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Henry	will	help	you,	if	it	is	in	his	power.	It	would	be	well	if	we	could	give</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>him	something	to	do.	He	feels	guilty	in	a	way.	I	have	little	time	to	observe	other people;	but—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	all	right.	He	can	run	into	Newton	with	me	now.	It	looks	to	me	as	though</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	own	life	had	hung	on	the	pitch	of	a	coin.	They	tossed	up!	After	that—so	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">tells	 me—he	 tried	 to	 dissuade	 your	 son-in-law,	 but	 failed.	 Lennox	 is	 rather cowed	 and	 dismayed—naturally.	 The	 young,	 however,	 survive	 mental	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">physical	 disasters	 and	 recover	 in	 the	 most	 amazing	 manner.	 Their	 mental</p>
<p class="calibre1">recuperation	is	on	a	par	with	their	bodily	powers	of	recovery.	Nature	is	on	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">side.	Let	me	urge	you	to	go	down	and	take	food.	If	you	can	even	lunch	with	your</p>
<p class="calibre1">party	I	should.	It	will	distract	your	mind." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter	declared	that	he	had	intended	to	do	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	am	an	old	soldier,"	he	said.	"It	shall	not	be	thought	I	evade	my	obligations for	 personal	 sorrow.	 As	 for	 this	 room,	 it	 is	 accursed	 and	 I	 am	 in	 a	 mind	 to destroy	it	utterly." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait—wait.	 We	 shall	 see	 what	 our	 fellow-men	 can	 find	 out	 for	 us.	 Do	 not think,	 because	 I	 am	 practical	 and	 business-like,	 I	 am	 not	 feeling	 this.	 Seldom have	 I	 had	 such	 a	 shock	 in	 nearly	 forty	 years'	 work.	 You	 know,	 without	 my telling	you,	how	deep	and	heartfelt	is	my	sympathy.	I	feel	for	you	both	from	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">soul." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	am	sure	of	that.	I	will	try	and	forget	myself	for	the	present.	I	must	go	to	my guests.	 I	 am	 very	 sorry	 for	 them	 also.	 It	 is	 a	 fearful	 experience	 to	 crash	 upon their	party	of	pleasure." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	hope	Travers	may	stay.	He	is	a	comfort	to	you,	is	he	not?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nobody	 can	 be	 a	 comfort	 just	 now.	 I	 shall	 not	 ask	 him	 to	 stay.	 Fortunately Henry	is	here.	He	will	stop	for	the	present.	Mary	is	all	that	matters.	I	shall	take</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	away	as	quickly	as	possible	and	devote	my	every	thought	to	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	sure	you	will.	It	is	a	sad	duty,	but	may	prove	a	very	necessary	one.	Their devotion	 was	 absolute.	 It	 must	 go	 hard	 with	 her	 when	 she	 realizes	 the	 whole meaning	of	this." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 went	 his	 way,	 and	 Sir	 Walter	 returned	 to	 his	 child	 again.	 With	 her	 he visited	 the	 dead,	 when	 told	 that	 he	 could	 do	 so.	 She	 was	 now	 very	 self-controlled.	She	stopped	a	little	while	only	beside	her	husband. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	beautiful	and	happy	he	looks,"	she	said.	"But	what	I	loved	is	gone;	and, going,	it	has	changed	all	the	rest.	This	is	not	Tom—only	the	least	part	of	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	father	bowed	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	felt	so	when	your	mother	died,	my	dearest	child." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>Then	 she	 knelt	 down	 and	 put	 her	 hand	 on	 the	 hand	 of	 the	 dead	 man	 and prayed.	 Her	 father	 knelt	 beside	 her,	 and	 it	 was	 he,	 not	 the	 young	 widow,	 who wept. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	rose	presently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	can	think	of	him	better	away	from	him	now,"	she	said.	"I	will	not	see	him again." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	returned	to	her	old	nursery,	and	he	told	her	that	he	was	going	to	face	life</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	take	the	head	of	his	table	at	luncheon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	 brave	 of	 you,	 dear	 father,"	 she	 said.	 Sir	 Walter	 waited	 for	 the	 gong	 to sound,	 but	 it	 did	 not,	 and	 he	 rebuked	 himself	 for	 thinking	 that	 it	 would	 sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Masters	 had	 a	 more	 correct	 sense	 of	 the	 fitness	 of	 things	 than	 he.	 He	 thought curiously	 upon	 this	 incident,	 and	 suspected	 that	 he	 must	 be	 unhinged	 a	 little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he	remembered	a	thing	that	he	had	desired	to	say	to	Mary	and	returned	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	do	not	wish	you	to	sleep	in	this	room	to-night,	my	darling,"	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Jane	has	begged	me	not	to.	I	am	going	to	sleep	with	her,"	she	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	IV.	"BY	THE	HAND	OF	GOD" </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	 Walter	 always	 remembered	 that	 Sunday	 luncheon	 and	 declared	 that	 it</p>
<p class="calibre1">reminded	 him	 of	 a	 very	 painful	 experience	 in	 his	 early	 life.	 When	 big-game shooting	in	South	Africa,	he	had	once	been	tossed	by	a	wounded	buffalo	bull.	By</p>
<p class="calibre1">good	 chance	 the	 creature	 threw	 him	 into	 a	 gully	 some	 feet	 lower	 than	 the surrounding	 bush.	 Thus	 it	 lost	 him,	 and	 he	 was	 safe	 from	 destruction.	 There, however,	he	remained	with	a	broken	leg	for	some	hours	until	rescued;	and	during</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	time	the	mosquitoes	caused	him	unspeakable	torments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To-day	the	terrible	disaster	of	the	morning	became	temporarily	overshadowed</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	the	necessity	of	enduring	his	friends'	comments	upon	it.	The	worst	phase	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	ordeal	was	their	pity.	Sir	Walter	had	never	been	pitied	in	his	life,	and	detested the	 experience.	 This	 stream	 of	 sympathy	 and	 the	 chastened	 voices	 much</p>
<p class="calibre1">oppressed	him.	He	was	angry	with	himself	also,	for	a	guilty	conviction	that,	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">truth,	 the	 interest	 of	 the	 visitors	 exceeded	 their	 grief.	 He	 felt	 it	 base	 to	 suspect them	of	any	such	thing;	but	the	buzz	of	their	polite	expressions,	combined	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	cautious	questions	and	evident	thirst	for	knowledge,	caused	him	exquisite</p>
<p class="calibre1">uneasiness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	all	wanted	to	know	everything	he	could	tell	them	concerning	Tom	May. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had	 he	 enemies?	 Was	 it	 conceivable	 that	 he	 might	 have	 even	 bitter	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">unscrupulous	enemies? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Dear	Mary	is	keeping	up	splendidly,"	said	Mrs.	Travers.	"She	is	magnificent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thank	Heaven	I	have	been	some	little	help	to	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	have,	Nelly,	without	a	doubt." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	 try	 to	 eat	 more,	 Walter,"	 urged	 Ernest	 Travers.	 "Much	 lies	 before	 you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed,	 the	 worst	 has	 yet	 to	 come.	 You	 must	 keep	 up	 for	 all	 our	 sakes.	 How thankfully	I	would	share	your	load	if	I	could!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 hope	 you	 are	 going	 to	 make	 this	 an	 official	 matter,	 Sir	 Walter,	 and communicate	 with	 the	 Society	 for	 Psychical	 Research,"	 urged	 Felix	 Fayre-Michell.	 "It	 is	 just	 a	 case	 for	 them.	 In	 fact,	 when	 this	 gets	 known	 widely,	 as	 it must,	of	course,	a	great	many	skilled	inquirers	will	wish	to	visit	Chadlands	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">spend	a	night	in	the	room." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	police	will	have	to	be	considered	first,"	declared	Colonel	Vane.	"This	is, of	 course,	 a	 police	 affair.	 I	 should	 think	 they	 will	 so	 regard	 it.	 There	 is	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>Service,	too.	The	Admiralty	will	be	sure	to	do	something." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	he	to	be	buried	at	Chadlands?	I	suppose	so,	poor	fellow,"	murmured	Ernest Travers.	 "I	 think	 your	 family	 graves	 so	 distinguished,	 Walter—so	 simple	 and fine	and	modest—just	perfectly	kept,	grassy	mounds,	and	simple	inscriptions.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	looking	at	them	after	service	to-day.	The	vicar	made	a	very	tactful	allusion</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 great	 grief	 that	 had	 overtaken	 the	 lord	 of	 the	 manor	 at	 the	 end	 of	 his sermon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	assisted	his	uncle	to	the	best	of	his	power.	It	was	he	who	went	into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">question	of	the	Sunday	service	from	the	neighboring	market	town,	and	proved, </p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	relief	of	Colonel	Vane	and	Mr.	Miles	Handford,	that	they	might	leave	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">comfort	before	nightfall	and	catch	a	train	to	London. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	 car	 is	 going	 in	 later,	 to	 meet	 poor	 Tom's	 father,"	 he	 said,	 "and	 if	 it's	 any convenience,	it	would	take	you	both." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	pair	thankfully	agreed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 Colonel	 Vane	 interested	 Sir	 Walter	 in	 spite	 of	 himself.	 The	 latter	 had spoken	of	an	inquiry,	and	Vane	urged	a	distinguished	name	upon	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	get	Peter	Hardcastle	if	you	can,"	he	said.	"He's	absolutely	top	hole	at	this sort	of	thing	at	present—an	amazing	beggar." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	seem	to	have	heard	the	name." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who	 hasn't?	 It	 was	 he	 who	 got	 to	 the	 bottom	 of	 that	 weird	 murder	 in Yorkshire." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	was	weird,"	said	Handford.	"I	knew	intimate	friends	of	the	murdered	man." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	 crime	 for	 which	 no	 logical	 reason	 existed,"	 continued	 the	 colonel.	 "It puzzled	 everybody,	 till	 Hardcastle	 succeeded	 where	 his	 superior	 officers	 at Scotland	 Yard	 had	 failed.	 I	 believe	 he's	 still	 young.	 But	 that	 was	 less	 amazing than	 the	 German	 spy—you	 remember	 now,	 Sir	 Walter?	 The	 spy	 had	 been	 too</p>
<p class="calibre1">clever	 for	 England	 and	 France—thanks	 to	 a	 woman	 who	 helped	 him.	 Peter</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hardcastle	got	to	know	her;	then	he	actually	disguised	himself	as	the	woman—</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	course	without	her	knowledge—arrested	her,	and	kept	an	appointment	that	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	made	with	the	spy.	What	was	the	spy	called?	I	forget." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wundt,"	said	Felix	Fayre-Michell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	I	don't	think	so.	Hardt	or	Hardfelt,	or	something	like	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Anyway,	 a	 jolly	 wonderful	 thing.	 He's	 the	 first	 man	 at	 this	 business,	 and	 I hope	you'll	be	able	to	secure	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	he	comes,	Sir	Walter,	don't	let	it	be	known	that	he	is	here.	Keep	it	a	secret. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	Hardcastle	could	come	down	as	your	guest,	and	nobody	know	he	was	here,	it</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>might	help	him	to	succeed." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	if	he	fails,	then	I	hope	you'll	invite	the	Psychical	Research	Society." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	 Walter	 let	 the	 chatter	 flow	 past	 him;	 but	 he	 concentrated	 on	 the	 name	 of Peter	 Hardcastle.	 He	 remembered	 the	 story	 of	 the	 spy,	 and	 the	 sensation	 it	 had aroused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Millicent	Fayre-Michell	also	remembered	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mr.	Hardcastle	declined	to	let	his	photograph	be	published	in	the	halfpenny</p>
<p class="calibre1">papers,	 I	 remember,"	 she	 said.	 "That	 struck	 me	 as	 so	 wonderful.	 There	 was	 a reason	given—that	he	did	not	wish	the	public	to	know	him	by	sight.	I	believe	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	never	seen	as	himself,	and	that	he	makes	up	just	as	easily	to	look	like	a	woman</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	a	man." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Some	people	believe	he	is	a	woman." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No!	You	don't	say	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"To	 have	 made	 up	 as	 that	 German's	 friend	 and	 so	 actually	 reached	 his presence—nay,	secured	him!	It	is	certainly	one	of	the	most	remarkable	pages	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	annals	of	crime,"	said	Ernest	Travers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	he	attached	to	Scotland	Yard	still,	or	does	he	work	independently?"	asked Miles	Handford. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	know	yet.	Mannering	has	already	urged	me	to	consult	Scotland	Yard</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 once.	 Indeed,	 he	 was	 going	 to	 approach	 them	 to-day.	 Mr.	 Hardcastle	 shall certainly	be	invited	to	do	what	he	can.	I	shall	leave	no	stone	unturned	to	reach</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	truth.	Yet	what	even	such	a	man	can	do	is	difficult	to	see.	The	walls	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Grey	Room	are	solid,	the	floor	is	of	sound	oak,	the	ceiling	is	nine	or	ten	inches</p>
<p class="calibre1">thick,	and	supported	by	immense	beams.	The	hearth	is	modern,	and	the	chimney</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	large	enough	to	admit	a	human	being.	This	was	proved	twelve	years	ago." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Give	 him	 a	 free	 hand	 all	 the	 same—with	 servants	 and	 everybody.	 I	 should ask	him	to	come	as	your	guest,	then	nobody	need	know	who	he	is,	and	he	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">pursue	his	investigations	the	more	freely." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Felix	 Fayre-Michell	 made	 this	 suggestion	 after	 luncheon	 was	 ended,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Masters	and	Fred	Caunter	had	left	the	room.	Then	the	conversation	showed	signs</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 drifting	 back	 to	 sentimentality.	 Sir	 Walter	 saw	 it	 coming	 in	 their	 eyes,	 and sought	to	head	them	off	by	inquiring	concerning	their	own	movements. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can	I	be	of	any	service	to	simplify	your	plans?	I	fear	this	terrible	event	has put	you	all	to	great	inconvenience." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Our	 inconvenience	 is	 nothing	 beside	 your	 sorrow,	 dear	 Walter,"	 said	 Nelly Travers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>All	declared	that	if	they	could	serve	the	cause	in	any	way	they	would	gladly stop	 at	 Chadlands,	 but	 since	 they	 were	 powerless	 to	 assist,	 they	 felt	 that	 the sooner	they	departed	the	better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	go,	but	we	leave	our	undying	sympathy	and	commiseration,	dear	friend," </p>
<p class="calibre1">declared	Mr.	Travers.	"Believe	me,	this	has	aged	my	wife	and	myself.	Probably</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 would	 not	 be	 an	 exaggeration	 to	 say	 it	 has	 aged	 us	 all.	 That	 he	 should	 have come	through	Jutland,	done	worthy	deeds,	won	honorable	mention	and	the	D.	S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">O.,	 then	 to	 be	 snatched	 out	 of	 life	 in	 this	 incomprehensible	 manner—nay, </p>
<p class="calibre1">perhaps	even	by	supernatural	means,	for	we	cannot	yet	actually	declare	it	is	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">so.	All	this	makes	it	impossible	to	say	much	that	can	comfort	you	or	dear	Mary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Time	must	pass	I	fear,	Walter.	You	must	get	her	away	into	another	environment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thank	Heaven	she	has	youth	on	her	side." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	 yes,	 I	 shall	 live	 for	 her,	 be	 sure	 of	 that."	 He	 left	 them	 and	 presently spoke	to	his	nephew	alone	in	his	study. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	what	you	can	for	them.	Handford	and	Vane	are	getting	off	this	afternoon, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	rest	early	to-morrow.	I	don't	think	I	shall	be	able	to	dine	with	them	to-night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom's	father	will	be	here.	I	fear	he	is	likely	to	be	prostrated	when	he	knows	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	is	over." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	he's	not	that	kind	of	man,	uncle.	Mary	tells	me	he	will	want	to	get	to	the bottom	of	this	in	his	own	way.	He's	one	of	the	fighting	sort,	but	he	believes	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">lot	 of	 queer	 things.	 I'm	 going	 in	 to	 Newton	 with	 Colonel	 Vane,	 and	 shall	 meet Mannering	 there	 about—about	 Sir	 Howard	 Fellowes.	 He'll	 come	 down	 to-morrow,	no	doubt,	perhaps	to-night.	Mannering	will	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	 tell	 Mannering	 to	 insist	 on	 a	 detective	 called	 Peter	 Hardcastle	 for	 the inquiry.	If	he's	left	Scotland	Yard	and	acting	independently,	none	the	less	engage</p>
<p class="calibre1">him.	I	shall,	of	course,	thankfully	pay	anything	to	get	this	tragedy	explained." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Be	sure	they	will	explain	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	they	do	not	I	shall	be	tempted	to	leave	altogether.	Indeed,	I	may	do	so	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	case.	Mary	will	never	reconcile	herself	to	live	here	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	 bother	 about	 the	 future,	 don't	 think	 about	 it.	 Consider	 yourself,	 and take	a	little	rest	this	afternoon.	Everybody	is	very	concerned	for	you,	they	mean</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	be	awfully	decent	in	their	way;	but	I	know	how	they	try	you.	They	can't	help</p>
<p class="calibre1">it.	Such	a	thing	takes	them	out	of	their	daily	round,	and	beggars	their	experience, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 makes	 them	 excited	 and	 tactless.	 There's	 no	 precedent	 for	 them,	 and	 you know	how	most	people	depend	on	precedent	and	how	they're	bowled	over	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything	new." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	will	go	to	Mary,	I	think.	Has	the	undertaker	been?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>"Yes,	uncle." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 want	 him	 to	 be	 buried	 with	 us	 here.	 I	 should	 not	 suppose	 his	 father	 will object." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	likely.	Mary	would	wish	it	so." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	 was	 so	 typical	 of	 Mary	 to	 think	 of	 Septimus	 May	 before	 everybody.	 She put	her	own	feelings	from	her	that	she	might	soften	the	blow	for	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	would." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are	you	equal	to	telling	the	clergyman	at	the	station	that	his	son	is	dead,	or can't	you	trust	yourself	to	do	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	expect	he'll	know	it	well	enough,	but	I'll	tell	him	everything	there	is	to	tell.	I remember	long	ago,	after	the	wedding,	that	he	was	interested	in	haunted	rooms, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	said	he	believed	in	such	things	on	Scriptural	grounds." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter	took	pause	at	this	statement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	is	news	to	me.	Supposing	he—However,	we	need	not	trouble	ourselves</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	him	yet.	He	will,	of	course,	be	as	deeply	concerned	to	get	to	the	bottom	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	 as	 I	 am,	 though	 we	 must	 not	 interfere,	 or	 make	 the	 inquiry	 harder	 for Hardcastle	than	he	is	bound	to	find	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Certainly	nobody	must	interfere.	I	only	hope	we	can	get	Peter	Hardcastle." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tell	 them	 to	 call	 me	 when	 Mr.	 May	 arrives,	 and	 not	 sooner.	 I'll	 see	 Mary, then	lie	down	for	an	hour	or	two." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	feel	all	right?	Should	you	care	to	see	Mannering?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	am	right	enough.	Say	'Good-bye'	to	Vane	and	Miles	Handford	for	me.	They</p>
<p class="calibre1">may	have	to	return	here	presently.	One	can't	tell	who	may	be	wanted,	and	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">may	not	be.	I	don't	know—these	things	are	outside	my	experience;	but	they	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">better	both	leave	you	their	directions." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	ask	them." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter	visited	his	daughter,	and	changed	his	mind	about	sleeping.	She	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">passing	 through	 an	 hour	 of	 unspeakable	 horror.	 The	 dark	 temple	 of	 realization had	 opened	 for	 her	 and	 she	 was	 treading	 its	 dreary	 aisles.	 Henceforth	 for	 long days—she	 told	 herself	 for	 ever—sorrow	 and	 sense	 of	 unutterable	 loss	 must	 be her	companions	and	share	her	waking	hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	stopped	together	alone	till	the	dusk	came	down	and	Mannering	returned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stayed	but	a	few	minutes,	and	presently	they	heard	his	car	start	again,	while</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	containing	the	departing	guests	and	Henry	Lennox	immediately	followed	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	due	course	Septimus	May	returned	to	Chadlands	with	him.	The	clergyman</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a>had	 heard	 of	 his	 son's	 end,	 and	 went	 immediately	 to	 see	 the	 dead	 man.	 There Mary	joined	him,	and	witnessed	his	self-control	under	very	shattering	grief.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	thin,	clean-shaven—a	grey	man	with	smouldering	eyes	and	an	expression	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">endurance.	A	fanatic	in	faith,	by	virtue	of	certain	asperities	of	mind	and	a	critical temperament,	 he	 had	 never	 made	 friends,	 won	 his	 parish	 into	 close	 ties,	 nor advanced	 the	 cause	 of	 his	 religion	 as	 he	 had	 yearned	 to	 do.	 With	 the	 zeal	 of	 a reformer,	 he	 had	 entered	 the	 ministry	 in	 youth;	 but	 while	 commanding	 respect for	his	own	rule	of	conduct	and	the	example	he	set	his	little	flock,	their	affection he	 never	 won.	 The	 people	 feared	 him,	 and	 dreaded	 his	 stern	 criticism.	 Once certain	spirits,	smarting	under	pulpit	censure,	had	sought	to	be	rid	of	him;	but	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">grounds	existed	on	which	they	could	eject	the	reverend	gentleman	or	challenge</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 status.	 He	 remained,	 therefore,	 as	 many	 like	 him	 remain,	 embedded	 in	 his parish	and	unknown	beyond	it.	He	was	a	poor	student	of	human	nature	and	life</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	dimmed	his	old	ambitions,	soured	his	hopes;	but	it	had	not	clouded	his	faith. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	a	passionate	fervor	he	believed	all	that	he	tried	to	teach,	and	held	that	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">almighty,	 all	 loving	 and	 all	 merciful	 God	 controlled	 every	 destiny,	 ordered existence	 for	 the	 greatest	 and	 least,	 and	 allowed	 nothing	 to	 happen	 upon	 earth that	was	not	the	best	that	could	happen	for	the	immortal	beings	He	had	created	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">His	own	image.	Upon	this	assurance	fell	the	greatest,	almost	the	only,	blow	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">life	 could	 deal	 Septimus	 May.	 He	 was	 stricken	 suddenly,	 fearfully	 with	 his unutterable	loss;	but	his	agony	turned	into	prayer	while	he	knelt	beside	his	son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	prayed	with	a	fiery	intensity	and	a	resonant	vibration	of	voice	that	scorched</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather	than	comforted	the	woman	who	knelt	beside	him.	The	fervor	of	the	man's</p>
<p class="calibre1">emotion	 and	 the	 depth	 of	 his	 conviction,	 running	 like	 a	 torrent	 through	 the narrow	 channels	 of	 his	 understanding,	 were	 destined	 presently	 to	 complicate	 a situation	sufficiently	painful	without	intervention;	for	a	time	swiftly	came	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">Septimus	 May	 forced	 his	 beliefs	 upon	 Chadlands	 and	 opposed	 them	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">opinions	of	other	people	as	deeply	concerned	as	himself	to	explain	the	death	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	 May,	 learning	 that	 most	 of	 the	 house	 party	 could	 not	 depart	 until	 the following	 morning,	 absented	 himself	 from	 dinner;	 indeed,	 he	 spent	 his	 time almost	 entirely	 with	 his	 boy,	 and	 when	 night	 came	 kept	 vigil	 beside	 him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	 of	 the	 strange	 possession	 of	 his	 mind	 already	 appeared,	 in	 curious hints	 that	 puzzled	 Sir	 Walter;	 but	 it	 was	 not	 until	 after	 the	 post-mortem examination	and	inquest	that	his	extraordinary	views	were	elaborated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Millicent	Fayre-Michell	and	her	uncle	were	the	first	to	depart	on	the	following</p>
<p class="calibre1">day.	The	girl	harbored	a	grievance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Surely	Mary	might	have	seen	me	a	moment	to	say	'Good-bye,'"	she	said.	"It's</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>a	very	dreadful	thing,	but	we've	been	so	sympathetic	and	understanding	about	it that	I	think	they	ought	to	feel	rather	grateful.	They	might	realize	how	trying	it	is for	 us,	 too.	 And	 to	 let	 me	 go	 without	 even	 seeing	 her—she	 saw	 Mrs.	 Travers over	and	over	again." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	 not	 mind.	 Grief	 makes	 people	 selfish,"	 declared	 Felix.	 "Probably	 we should	not	have	acted	so.	I	think	we	should	have	hidden	our	sufferings	and	faced</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	 duty;	 but	 perhaps	 we	 are	 exceptional.	 I	 dare	 say	 Mrs.	 May	 will	 write	 and express	regret	and	gratitude	later.	We	must	allow	for	her	youth	and	sorrow." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Fayre-Michell	rather	prided	himself	on	the	charity	of	this	conclusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Mr.	and	Mrs.	Travers	departed,	Sir	Walter	bade	them	farewell.	The	lady</p>
<p class="calibre1">wept,	and	her	tears	fell	on	his	hand	as	he	held	it.	She	was	hysterical. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"For	 Heaven's	 sake	 don't	 let	 Mary	 be	 haunted	 by	 that	 dreadful	 priest,"	 she said.	"There	is	something	terrible	about	him.	He	has	no	bowels	of	compassion.	I tried	to	console	him	for	the	loss	of	his	son,	and	he	turned	upon	me	as	if	I	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">weak-minded." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 had	 to	 tell	 him	 he	 was	 being	 rude	 and	 forgetting	 that	 he	 spoke	 to	 a	 lady," </p>
<p class="calibre1">said	 Ernest	 Travers.	 "One	 makes	 every	 allowance	 for	 a	 father's	 sufferings;	 but they	 should	 not	 take	 the	 form	 of	 abrupt	 and	 harsh	 speech	 to	 a	 sympathetic fellow-creature—nay,	to	anyone,	let	alone	a	woman.	His	sacred	calling	ought	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	man's	profession	cannot	alter	his	manners,	my	dear	Ernest;	they	come	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">defects	 of	 temperament,	 no	 doubt.	 May	 must	 not	 be	 judged.	 His	 faith	 would move	mountains." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	would	mine,"	said	Ernest	Travers,	"and	so	would	yours,	Walter.	But	it	is perfectly	possible	to	be	a	Christian	and	a	gentleman.	To	imply	that	our	faith	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">weak	 because	 we	 expressed	 ordinary	 human	 emotions	 and	 pitied	 him</p>
<p class="calibre1">unfeignedly	for	the	loss	of	his	only	child—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good-bye,	 good-bye,	 my	 dear	 friends,"	 answered	 the	 other.	 "I	 cannot	 say how	I	esteem	your	kindly	offices	in	this	affliction.	May	we	meet	again	presently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">God	bless	and	keep	you	both." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	post-mortem	examination	revealed	no	physical	reason	why	Thomas	May</p>
<p class="calibre1">should	 have	 ceased	 to	 breathe.	 Neither	 did	 the	 subsequent	 investigations	 of	 a Government	 analytical	 chemist	 throw	 any	 light	 upon	 the	 sailor's	 sudden	 death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	cause	existed,	and	therefore	none	could	be	reported	at	the	inquest	held	a	day</p>
<p class="calibre1">later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	coroner's	jury	brought	in	a	verdict	rarely	heard,	but	none	dissented	from</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>it.	They	held	that	May	had	received	his	death	"by	the	hand	of	God." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	men	receive	death	from	the	hand	of	God,"	said	Septimus	May,	when	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">judicial	 inquiry	 was	 ended.	 "They	 receive	 life	 from	 the	 hand	 of	 God	 also.	 But, while	bowing	to	that,	there	is	a	great	deal	more	we	are	called	to	do	when	God's</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand	falls	as	it	has	fallen	upon	my	son.	To-night	I	shall	pray	beside	his	dust,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">presently,	when	he	is	at	peace,	I	shall	be	guided.	There	is	a	grave	duty	beside	me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter,	and	none	must	come	between	me	and	that	duty." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	is	a	duty	before	all	of	us,	and	be	sure	nobody	will	shrink	from	it.	I	have done	what	is	right,	so	far.	We	have	secured	a	famous	detective—the	most	famous</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 England,	 they	 tell	 me.	 He	 is	 called	 Peter	 Hardcastle,	 and	 he	 will,	 I	 hope,	 be able	to	arrive	here	immediately." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	clergyman	shook	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 will	 say	 nothing	 at	 present,"	 he	 answered.	 "But,	 believe	 me,	 a	 thousand detectives	 cannot	 explain	 my	 son's	 death.	 I	 shall	 return	 to	 this	 subject	 after	 the funeral,	Sir	Walter.	But	my	conviction	grows	that	the	reason	of	these	things	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">never	be	revealed	to	the	eye	of	science.	To	the	eye	of	faith	alone	we	must	trust</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	explanation	of	what	has	happened.	There	are	things	concealed	from	the	wise</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	prudent—to	be	revealed	unto	babes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	night	the	master	of	Chadlands,	his	nephew,	and	the	priest	dined	together, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	Henry	Lennox	implored	a	privilege. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 feel	 I	 owe	 it	 to	 poor	 Tom	 in	 a	 way,"	 he	 said.	 "I	 beg	 that	 you	 will	 let	 me spend	the	night	in	the	Grey	Room,	Uncle	Walter.	I	would	give	my	soul	to	clear</p>
<p class="calibre1">this." </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	his	uncle	refused	with	a	curt	shake	of	the	head,	and	the	clergyman	uttered</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	reproof. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	 not	 speak	 so	 lightly,"	 he	 said.	 "You	 use	 a	 common	 phrase	 and	 a	 very objectionable	phrase,	young	man.	Do	you	rate	your	soul	so	low	that	you	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">surrender	it	for	the	satisfaction	of	a	morbid	craving?	For	that	is	all	this	amounts</p>
<p class="calibre1">to.	Not	to	such	an	inquirer	will	my	son's	death	reveal	its	secret." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	have	already	received	half-a-dozen	letters	from	people	offering	and	wishing</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	spend	a	night	in	that	accursed	room,"	said	Sir	Walter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	not	call	it	'accursed'	until	you	know	more,"	urged	Septimus	May. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	have	indeed	charity,"	answered	the	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why	withhold	charity?	We	must	approach	the	subject	in	the	only	spirit	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	 disarm	 the	 danger.	 These	 inquirers	 who	 seek	 to	 solve	 the	 mystery	 are	 not concerned	with	my	son's	death,	only	the	means	that	brought	it	about.	Not	to	such</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>as	 they	 will	 any	 answer	 be	 vouchsafed,	 and	 not	 to	 the	 spirit	 of	 materialistic inquiry,	 either.	 I	 speak	 what	 I	 know,	 and	 will	 say	 more	 upon	 the	 subject	 at another	time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	cannot	accept	this	awful	thing	without	resentment	or	demur,	Mr.	May?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">asked	Henry	Lennox. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who	 shall	 demur?	 Did	 not	 even	 the	 unenlightened	 men	 who	 formed	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">coroner's	jury	declare	that	Tom	passed	into	another	world	by	the	hand	of	God? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Can	we	question	our	Creator?	I,	too,	desire	as	much	as	any	human	being	can	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">explanation;	what	is	more,	I	am	far	more	confident	of	an	explanation	than	you	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	other	man.	But	that	is	because	I	already	know	the	only	road	by	which	it	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">please	God	to	send	an	explanation.	And	that	is	not	the	road	which	scientists	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">rationalists	are	used	to	travel.	It	is	a	road	that	I	must	be	allowed	to	walk	alone." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 left	 them	 after	 dinner,	 and	 returned	 to	 his	 daughter-in-law.	 She	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">determined	not	to	attend	the	funeral,	but	Mr.	May	argued	with	her,	examined	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">reasons,	 found	 them,	 in	 his	 opinion,	 not	 sufficient,	 and	 prevailed	 with	 her	 to change	her	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Drink	 the	 cup	 to	 the	 dregs,"	 he	 said.	 "This	 is	 our	 grief,	 our	 trial.	 None	 feel and	 know	 what	 we	 feel	 and	 know,	 and	 your	 youth	 is	 called	 to	 bear	 a	 burden heavy	to	be	borne.	You	must	stand	beside	his	grave	as	surely	as	I	must	commit</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	to	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Men	 will	 go	 far	 to	 look	 upon	 the	 coffin	 of	 one	 whose	 end	 happens	 to	 be mysterious	 or	 terrible.	 The	 death	 of	 Sir	 Walter's	 son-in-law	 had	 made	 much matter	 for	 the	 newspapers,	 and	 not	 only	 Chadlands,	 but	 the	 countryside</p>
<p class="calibre1">converged	upon	the	naval	funeral,	lined	the	route	to	the	grave,	and	crowded	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	burying	ground	where	the	dead	man	would	lie.	Cameras	pointed	their	eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	the	gun-carriage	and	the	mourners	behind	it.	The	photographers	worked	for	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sort	 of	 illustrated	 paper	 that	 tramples	 with	 a	 swine's	 hoofs	 and	 routs	 up	 with	 a swine's	nose	the	matter	its	clients	best	love	to	purchase.	Mary,	supported	by	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">father	and	her	cousin,	preserved	a	brave	composure.	Indeed,	she	was	less	visibly</p>
<p class="calibre1">moved	than	they.	It	seemed	that	the	ascetic	parent	of	the	dead	had	power	to	lift</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	widow	to	his	own	stern	self-control.	The	chaplain	of	Tom	May's	ship	assisted</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 the	 service,	 but	 Septimus	 May	 conducted	 it.	 Not	 a	 few	 old	 messmates</p>
<p class="calibre1">attended,	 for	 the	 sailor	 had	 been	 popular,	 and	 his	 unexpected	 death	 brought genuine	grief	to	many	men.	Under	a	pile	of	flowers	the	coffin	was	carried	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">grave.	Rare	and	precious	blossoms	came	from	Sir	Walter's	friends,	and	H.	M.	S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indomitable	 sent	 a	 mighty	 anchor	 of	 purple	 violets.	 Mr.	 May	 read	 the	 service without	a	tremor,	but	his	eyes	blazed	out	of	his	lean	head,	and	there	lacked	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">other	signs	to	indicate	the	depth	of	emotion	he	concealed.	Then	the	bluejackets</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>who	had	drawn	the	gun-carriage	fired	a	volley,	and	the	rattle	of	their	musketry echoed	sharply	from	the	church	tower. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon	the	evening	of	the	day	that	followed	Septimus	May	resumed	the	subject</p>
<p class="calibre1">concerning	 which	 he	 had	 already	 fitfully	 spoken.	 His	 ideas	 were	 now	 in	 order, and	 he	 brought	 a	 formidable	 argument	 to	 support	 a	 strange	 request.	 Indeed,	 it amounted	 to	 a	 demand,	 and	 for	 a	 time	 it	 seemed	 doubtful	 whether	 Sir	 Walter would	 deny	 him.	 The	 priest,	 indeed,	 declared	 that	 he	 could	 take	 no	 denial,	 and his	 host	 was	 thankful	 that	 other	 and	 stronger	 arguments	 than	 his	 own	 were	 at hand	to	argue	the	other	side.	For	Dr.	Mannering	stayed	at	the	manor	house	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 funeral,	 and	 the	 Rev.	 Noel	 Prodgers,	 the	 vicar	 of	 Chadlands,	 a	 distant connection	of	the	Lennoxes,	was	also	dining	there.	Until	now	Mannering	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	well	speak,	but	he	invited	himself	to	dinner	on	the	day	after	the	funeral	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	might	press	a	course	of	action	upon	those	who	had	suffered	so	severely.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">wished	 Sir	 Walter	 to	 take	 his	 daughter	 away	 at	 once,	 for	 her	 health's	 sake,	 and while	advancing	this	advice	considered	the	elder	also,	for	these	things	had	upset</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	master	of	Chadlands	in	mind	and	body,	and	Mannering	was	aware	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 the	 morrow	 Peter	 Hardcastle	 would	 arrive,	 and	 he	 had	 urgently	 directed that	his	coming	should	be	in	a	private	capacity,	unknown	to	the	local	police	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">neighborhood.	Neither	did	he	wish	the	staff	of	Chadlands	to	associate	him	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	tragedy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	official	examination	of	the	room	had	been	made	by	the	local	constabulary, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	upon	the	occasion	of	Nurse	Forrester's	death;	but	it	was	a	perfunctory	matter, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	those	responsible	for	it	understood	that	special	attention	would	presently	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">paid	to	the	problem	by	the	supreme	authority. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"After	 this	 man	 has	 been	 and	 gone,	 I	 do	 earnestly	 beg	 you	 to	 leave	 England and	 get	 abroad,	 Sir	 Walter,"	 said	 Mannering.	 "I	 think	 it	 your	 duty,	 not	 only	 for your	girl's	sake,	but	your	own.	Do	not	even	wait	for	the	report.	There	is	nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 keep	 you,	 and	 I	 shall	 personally	 be	 very	 thankful	 and	 relieved	 if	 you	 will manage	this	and	take	Mary	to	some	fresh	scenes,	a	place	or	country	that	she	has</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 visited	 before.	 There	 is	 nothing	 like	 an	 entirely	 novel	 environment	 for distracting	the	mind,	bracing	the	nerves,	and	restoring	tone." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 must	 do	 my	 duty,"	 answered	 the	 other,	 "and	 that	 remains	 to	 be	 seen.	 If Hardcastle	 should	 find	 out	 anything,	 there	 may	 be	 a	 call	 upon	 me.	 At	 least,	 I cannot	 turn	 my	 back	 upon	 Chadlands	 till	 the	 mystery	 is	 threshed	 out	 to	 the bottom,	as	far	as	man	can	do	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	then	that	Septimus	May	spoke	and	astounded	his	hearers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	give	me	the	opportunity	to	introduce	my	subject,"	he	said,	"for	it	bears</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>directly	on	Sir	Walter's	intentions,	and	it	is	in	my	power,	as	I	devoutly	believe,	to free	him	swiftly	of	any	further	need	to	remain	here.	I	am,	of	course,	prepared	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">argue	 for	 my	 purpose,	 but	 would	 rather	 not	 do	 so.	 Briefly,	 I	 hold	 it	 a	 vital obligation	 to	 spend	 this	 night	 in	 the	 Grey	 Room,	 and	 I	 ask	 that	 no	 obstacle	 of any	 kind	 be	 raised	 to	 prevent	 my	 doing	 so.	 The	 wisdom	 of	 man	 is	 foolishness before	the	wit	of	God,	and	what	I	desire	to	do	is	God's	will	and	wish,	impressed</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon	me	while	I	knelt	for	long	hours	and	prayed	to	know	it.	I	am	convinced,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	should	be	enough.	In	this	matter	I	am	far	from	satisfied	that	all	has	yet	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">done,	 within	 the	 Almighty's	 purpose	 and	 direction,	 to	 discover	 the	 mystery	 of our	terrible	loss.	But	He	helps	those	who	help	themselves,	remember,	and	I	owe</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 to	 my	 son,	 Sir	 Walter,	 and	 you	 owe	 it	 to	 your	 daughter	 Mary	 first,	 and	 the community	also,	to	take	such	steps	as	Heaven,	through	me,	has	now	directed." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 were	 for	 a	 moment	 struck	 dumb	 by	 this	 extraordinary	 assertion	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">demand.	 A	 thousand	 objections	 leaped	 to	 the	 lips	 of	 the	 elder	 men,	 and	 Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prodgers,	a	devout	young	Christian	of	poor	physique	but	great	spiritual	courage, </p>
<p class="calibre1">found	 himself	 as	 interested	 by	 this	 fearless	 demand	 of	 faith	 as	 the	 others	 were alarmed	by	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	 know	 it	 is	 so,	 May.	 None	 recognizes	 our	 obligations,	 both	 to	 the	 living and	the	dead,	more	acutely	than	I	do.	A	very	famous	man	of	European	reputation</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	 be	 here	 to-morrow,	 and	 if	 you,	 too,	 desire	 a	 representative,	 you	 have	 only got	to	say	so." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	desire	no	representative	armed	with	material	craft	or	knowledge	of	criminal</p>
<p class="calibre1">procedure.	 I	 am	 my	 own	 representative,	 and	 I	 come	 armed	 with	 greater	 power than	any	you	can	command	on	earth,	Sir	Walter.	I	mean	my	Maker's	response	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	prayer.	I	must	spend	the	night	in	that	room,	and	cannot	leave	Chadlands	until</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 have	 done	 so.	 I	 trust	 to	 no	 human	 expedient	 or	 precaution,	 for	 such	 things would	actually	disarm	me;	but	my	faith	is	in	the	God	I	have	served	to	the	best	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	power	from	my	youth	up.	I	entertain	not	the	least	shadow	of	fear	or	doubt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	fear	or	doubt	would	be	to	fail.	I	rely	absolutely	on	the	Supreme	Being	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">has	permitted	this	unspeakable	sorrow	to	fall	upon	us,	and	there	is	no	living	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">less	 likely	 than	 myself	 to	 fall	 a	 victim	 to	 the	 unknown	 spirit	 hidden	 here	 and permitted	to	exercise	such	awful	control	over	us.	The	time	has	come	to	challenge</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	spirit	in	the	name	of	its	Maker,	and	to	cleanse	your	house	once	and	for	all	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	 which,	 potent	 for	 evil	 though	 it	 is	 allowed	 to	 be,	 must	 yield	 to	 the forces	of	the	Most	High,	even	in	the	feeble	hand	of	His	minister." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	doctor	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>"Is	 it	 possible,	 sir,	 that	 you	 attribute	 your	 son's	 death	 to	 anything	 but	 natural physical	forces?"	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	 it	 possible	 to	 do	 otherwise?	 How	 can	 you,	 of	 all	 men,	 ask?	 Science	 has spoken—or,	rather,	science	has	been	struck	dumb.	No	natural,	physical	force	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">responsible	for	his	end.	He	died	without	any	cause	that	you	could	discover.	This</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	no	new	thing,	however.	History	records	that	men	have	passed	similarly	under</p>
<p class="calibre1">visitations	beyond	human	power	to	explain.	If	the	Lord	could	slay	multitudes	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	night	at	a	breath,	as	we	know	from	the	pages	of	the	Old	Testament,	then	it	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">certain	 He	 can	 still	 end	 the	 life	 of	 any	 man	 at	 any	 moment,	 and	 send	 His messengers	to	do	so.	I	believe	in	good	and	evil	spirits	as	I	believe	in	my	Bible, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I	know	that,	strong	and	terrible	though	they	may	be	and	gifted	with	capital</p>
<p class="calibre1">powers	 against	 our	 flesh,	 yet	 the	 will	 of	 God	 is	 stronger	 than	 the	 strongest	 of them.	These	things,	I	say,	have	happened	before.	They	are	sent	to	try	our	faith.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	 not	 mourn	 my	 son,	 save	 with	 the	 blind,	 natural	 pang	 of	 paternity,	 because	 I know	that	he	has	been	withdrawn	from	this	world	for	higher	purposes	in	another; </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 the	 means	 of	 his	 going	 I	 demand	 to	 investigate,	 because	 they	 may	 signify much	more	than	his	death	itself.	One	reason	for	his	death	may	be	this:	that	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	now	called	to	understand	what	is	hidden	in	the	Grey	Room.	My	son's	death</p>
<p class="calibre1">may	 have	 been	 necessary	 to	 that	 explanation.	 Human	 intervention	 may	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">demanded	 there.	 One	 of	 God's	 immortal	 souls,	 for	 reasons	 we	 cannot	 tell,	 may be	 chained	 in	 that	 room,	 waiting	 its	 liberation	 at	 human	 hands.	 We	 are</p>
<p class="calibre1">challenged,	 and	 I	 accept	 the	 challenge,	 being	 impelled	 thereto	 by	 the	 sacred message	that	has	been	put	into	my	heart." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	his	fellow-priest	stared	in	bewilderment	at	Septimus	May's	extraordinary</p>
<p class="calibre1">opinions,	while	to	the	physician	this	was	the	chatter	of	a	lunatic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 will	 take	 my	 Bible	 into	 that	 haunted	 room	 to-night,"	 concluded	 the clergyman,	 "and	 I	 will	 pray	 to	 God,	 Who	 sits	 above	 both	 quick	 and	 dead,	 to protect	me,	guide	me,	and	lead	me	to	my	duty." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	flout	reason	when	you	say	these	things,	my	dear	May." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	why	should	I	not	flout	reason?	What	Christian	but	knows	well	enough</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 reason	 is	 the	 staff	 that	 breaks	 in	 our	 hands	 and	 wounds	 us?	 Much	 of	 our most	vital	experience	has	no	part	nor	lot	with	reason.	A	thousand	things	happen</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 soul's	 history	 which	 reason	 cannot	 account	 for.	 A	 thousand	 moods, </p>
<p class="calibre1">temptations,	incitements	prompt	us	to	action	or	deter	us	from	it—urge	us	to	do	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">avoid—for	which	reason	is	not	responsible.	Reason,	if	we	bring	these	emotions</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	it,	cannot	even	pronounce	upon	them.	Yet	in	them	and	from	them	springs	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>life	of	the	soul	and	the	conviction	of	immortality.	'To	act	on	impulse'—who	but daily	realizes	that	commonplace	in	his	own	experience?	The	mind	does	not	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">play	 tricks	 and	 laugh	 at	 reason	 in	 dreams	 while	 we	 sleep.	 It	 laughs	 at	 reason while	 we	 wake,	 and	 the	 sanest	 spirit	 experiences	 inspired	 moments,	 mad</p>
<p class="calibre1">moments,	 unaccountable	 impulses	 the	 reason	 for	 which	 he	 knows	 not.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">ancients	 explained	 these	 as	 temptations	 of	 malicious	 and	 malignant	 spirits	 or promptings	 from	 unseen	 beings	 who	 wish	 man	 well.	 And	 where	 the	 urge	 is	 to evil,	that	may	well	be	the	truth;	and	where	it	is	to	good,	who	can	doubt	whence</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	inspiration	comes?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	shall	not	my	inspiration—to	employ	the	cleverest	detective	in	England</p>
<p class="calibre1">—be	also	of	good?"	asked	Sir	Walter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Emphatically	 not.	 Because	 this	 thing	 is	 in	 another	 category	 than	 that	 of human	 crime.	 It	 is	 lifted	 upon	 a	 plane	 where	 the	 knowledge	 of	 man	 avails nothing.	You	are	a	Christian,	and	you	should	understand	this	as	well	as	I	do.	If</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	is	danger,	then	I	am	secure,	because	I	have	the	only	arms	that	can	avail	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">battle	 of	 the	 spirit.	 My	 trust	 is	 shield	 enough	 against	 any	 evil	 being	 that	 may roam	this	earth	or	be	held	by	invisible	bonds	within	the	walls	of	the	Grey	Room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	will	justify	the	ways	of	God	to	man	and,	through	the	channel	of	potent	prayer, </p>
<p class="calibre1">exorcise	 this	 presence	 and	 bring	 peace	 to	 your	 afflicted	 house.	 For	 any	 living fellow-creature	would	I	gladly	pit	my	faith	against	evil;	how	much	more,	then,	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 matter	 where	 my	 very	 own	 life's	 blood	 has	 been	 shed?	 You	 cannot	 deny	 me this.	It	is	my	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a>"I	 will	 ask	 you	 to	 listen	 to	 the	 arguments	 against	 you,	 nevertheless,"	 replied Mannering.	"You	have	propounded	an	extraordinary	theory,	and	must	not	mind	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	disagree	with	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Speak	for	yourself	alone,	then,"	answered	May.	"I	do	not	ask	or	expect	a	man of	 your	 profession	 to	 agree	 with	 me.	 But	 the	 question	 ceases	 to	 be	 your province." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	 not	 say	 that,	 sir,"	 urged	 Henry	 Lennox.	 "I	 don't	 think	 my	 uncle	 agrees with	you	either.	You	are	assuming	too	much." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Honestly,	 I	 can't	 quite	 admit	 your	 assumption,	 my	 dear	 May,"	 declared	 Sir Walter.	 "You	 go	 too	 far—farther	 than	 is	 justified	 at	 this	 stage	 of	 events,	 at	 any rate.	 Were	 we	 in	 no	 doubt	 that	 a	 spirit	 is	 granted	 power	 within	 my	 house	 to destroy	 human	 life,	 then	 I	 confess,	 with	 due	 precautions,	 I	 could	 not	 deny	 you access	to	it	in	the	omnipotent	Name	you	invoke.	I	am	a	Christian	and	believe	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bible	 as	 soundly	 as	 you	 do.	 But	 why	 assume	 such	 an	 extraordinary	 situation? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why	seek	a	supernatural	cause	for	dear	Tom's	death	before	we	are	satisfied	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	other	exists?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are	 you	 not	 satisfied?	 What	 mortal	 man	 can	 explain	 the	 facts	 on	 any foundation	of	human	knowledge?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Consider	how	limited	human	knowledge	is,"	said	Mannering,	"and	grant	that we	 have	 not	 exhausted	 its	 possibilities	 yet.	 There	 may	 be	 some	 physical</p>
<p class="calibre1">peculiarity	about	the	room,	some	deadly	but	perfectly	natural	chemical	accident, </p>
<p class="calibre1">some	 volatile	 stuff,	 in	 roof	 or	 walls,	 that	 reacts	 to	 the	 lowered	 temperatures	 of night.	 A	 thousand	 rare	 chance	 combinations	 of	 matter	 may	 occur	 which	 are</p>
<p class="calibre1">capable	of	examination,	and	which,	under	skilled	experiment,	will	resolve	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">secret.	 Nothing	 it	 more	 bewildering	 than	 a	 good	 conjuring	 trick	 till	 we	 know how	it	is	done,	and	Nature	is	the	supreme	conjurer.	We	have	not	found	out	all	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">tricks,	and	never	shall	do	so;	but	we	very	well	know	that	a	solution	to	all	of	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">exists." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	material	outlook	and	arrogant,"	said	the	priest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whereupon	Mannering	grew	a	little	warm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	is	neither	material	nor	arrogant.	I	am	humbler	than	you,	and	your	positive</p>
<p class="calibre1">assertion	seems	much	the	more	arrogant.	This	is	the	twentieth	century,	and	your</p>
<p class="calibre1">mediaeval	 attitude	 would	 win	 no	 possible	 sympathy	 or	 support	 from	 any</p>
<p class="calibre1">educated	man." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Truth	 can	 afford	 to	 be	 patient,"	 answered	 May.	 "But	 I,	 too,	 am	 quite	 sane, though	your	face	doubts	it.	I	do	not	claim	that	human	prayer	can	alter	physical</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a>laws,	and	I	do	not	ask	my	Maker	to	work	a	miracle	on	my	behalf	or	suspend	the operations	of	cause	and	effect.	But	I	am	satisfied	that	we	are	in	a	region	outside</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	 experience	 and	 on	 another	 plane	 and	 dimension	 than	 those	 controlled	 by natural	law.	God	has	permitted	us	to	enter	such	a	region.	He	has	opened	the	door</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	this	mystery.	He	has	spoken	to	my	soul	and	so	directed	me	that	I	cannot	sit</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	folded	hands.	This	is,	I	repeat,	a	challenge	to	me	personally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	is,	as	I	potently	believe,	a	being	in	bondage	here	which	only	the	voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	God,	speaking	through	one	of	His	creatures,	can	liberate.	If	I	am	wrong,	then	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">shall	 pray	 in	 vain;	 if	 right,	 as	 I	 know	 by	 deepest	 conviction	 and	 intuition,	 then my	prayer	must	avail.	In	any	case,	I	do	my	duty,	and	if	I	myself	was	called	to	die</p>
<p class="calibre1">while	so	doing,	what	nobler	death	can	I	desire?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mannering	 regarded	 the	 speaker	 with	 growing	 concern.	 But	 he	 still	 assumed</p>
<p class="calibre1">sanity	on	the	part	of	the	reverend	gentleman,	and	still	felt	considerable	irritation mix	with	his	solicitude. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	must	consider	others	a	little,"	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	Dr.	Mannering;	they	must	consider	me.	Providence	sends	me	a	message</p>
<p class="calibre1">denied	to	the	rest	of	you,	because	I	am	a	fit	recipient;	you	are	not.	It	is	Newman's</p>
<p class="calibre1">'Illative	Sense'—a	conviction	arising	from	well-springs	far	deeper	and	purer	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">those	that	account	for	human	reason.	I	know	because	I	know.	Reasoning,	at	best, </p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 mere	 inference	 deduced	 from	 observation,	 but	 I	 am	 concerned	 with	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">inspiration—a	something	akin	to	the	gift	of	prophecy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	 I	 can	 only	 hope	 that	 Sir	 Walter	 will	 exercise	 his	 rights	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">responsibilities	and	deny	you	what	you	wish." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	has	faith,	and	I	am	sorry	that	you	lack	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	Mr.	May,	you	must	not	say	that.	It	is	entirely	reasonable	that	Mannering</p>
<p class="calibre1">should	 ask	 you	 to	 consider	 others,"	 said	 Sir	 Walter.	 "To	 you	 a	 sudden	 and peaceful	death	might	be	no	ill;	but	it	would	be	a	very	serious	ill	to	the	living—a</p>
<p class="calibre1">loss	 to	 your	 work	 on	 earth,	 which	 is	 not	 done,	 a	 shock	 and	 grief	 to	 those	 who respect	you,	and	a	reflection	on	all	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let	the	living	minister	to	the	living	and	put	their	trust	in	God." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mannering	spoke	to	the	vicar	of	Chadlands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	do	you	think,	Prodgers?	You	are	a	parson,	too,	yet	may	be	able	to	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 our	 eyes.	 Surely	 common	 sense	 shouldn't	 be	 left	 out	 of	 our	 calculations, even	if	they	concern	the	next	world?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 respect	 Mr.	 May's	 faith,"	 answered	 the	 younger	 priest,	 "and	 assuredly	 I believe	 that	 if	 we	 eliminate	 all	 physical	 and	 natural	 causes	 from	 poor	 Captain</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>May's	death,	then	no	member	of	our	sacred	calling	should	fear	to	spend	the	night alone	in	that	room.	Jacob	wrestled	with	the	angel	of	light.	Shall	the	servants	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">God	fear	to	oppose	a	dark	angel?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well	spoken,"	said	Mr.	May. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	that	is	not	all,	sir,"	continued	Noel	Prodgers.	"It	is	impossible	that	we	can share	 such	 certainty	 as	 you	 claim.	 Probability	 lies	 entirely	 against	 it.	 This	 has happened	 twice,	 remember,	 and	 each	 time	 a	 valuable	 and	 precious	 life</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappears,	 for	 causes	 beyond	 our	 knowledge.	 That,	 however,	 is	 no	 reason	 for assuming	 the	 causes	 are	 beyond	 all	 human	 knowledge.	 We	 do	 not	 all	 possess learning	in	physics.	I	would	venture	most	earnestly	to	beg	you	to	desist,	at	least</p>
<p class="calibre1">until	much	more	has	been	done	and	this	famous	professional	man	has	made	such</p>
<p class="calibre1">researches	as	his	genius	suggests.	That	is	only	reasonable,	and	reason,	after	all, </p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 a	 mighty	 gift	 of	 God—a	 gift,	 no	 doubt,	 often	 abused	 by	 finite	 beings,	 who actually	 use	 it	 to	 defy	 the	 Giver—yet	 none	 the	 less,	 in	 its	 proper	 place,	 the handmaid	of	faith	and	the	light	of	true	progress." </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 Septimus	 May	 argued	 against	 him.	 "To	 shelter	 behind	 reason	 at	 such	 a moment	 is	 to	 blunt	 the	 sword	 of	 the	 spirit,"	 he	 replied,	 "and	 human	 reason	 is never	 the	 handmaid	 of	 faith,	 as	 you	 wrongly	 suggest,	 but	 her	 obdurate, </p>
<p class="calibre1">unsleeping	 foe.	 That	 which	 metaphysicians	 call	 intuition,	 and	 which	 I	 call	 the voice	 of	 God,	 tells	 me	 in	 clear	 tones	 that	 my	 boy	 died	 by	 no	 human	 agency whatever	and	by	no	natural	accident.	He	was	wrapt	from	this	life	to	the	next	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	twinkling	of	an	eye	by	forces,	or	a	force,	concerning	which	we	know	nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">save	through	the	Word	of	God.	I	will	go	farther.	I	will	venture	to	declare	that	this death-dealing	ghost,	or	discarnate	but	conscious	being,	may	not	be,	as	you	say,	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">dark	 angel—perhaps	 not	 wholly	 evil—perhaps	 not	 evil	 at	 all.	 One	 thing	 none can	 question—it	 did	 the	 will	 of	 its	 Creator,	 as	 we	 all	 must,	 and	 we	 are	 not, therefore,	justified	in	asserting	that	a	malignant	force	was	exerted.	To	say	so	is	to speak	 in	 terms	 of	 our	 own	 bitter	 loss	 and	 our	 own	 aching	 hearts.	 But	 we	 are justified	 in	 believing	 that	 a	 fearful,	 unknown	 power	 was	 liberated	 during	 the night	that	Tom	died,	and	I	desire	to	approach	that	power	upon	my	knees	and	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	life	in	my	Maker's	hands." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 conviction	 of	 this	 righteous	 but	 superstitious	 soul	 was	 uttered	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">passionate	 zeal.	 He	 puzzled	 to	 understand	 how	 fellow	 Christians	 could	 argue against	him,	and	much	resented	the	fact	that	Sir	Walter	withstood	his	claim	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">declined	to	permit	the	experiment	he	desired	to	make.	A	formalist	and	precisian, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	held	any	sort	of	doubt	to	be	backsliding	before	the	message	in	his	own	heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	argued	unavailingly	with	him,	and	Henry	Lennox	suggested	a	compromise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why	 is	 it	 vital,	 after	 all,	 that	 only	 one	 should	 undertake	 this	 ordeal?"	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>asked.	"I	begged	you	to	let	me	try—for	revenge." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	not	use	that	word,"	said	Mr.	Prodgers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	at	any	rate,	I	feel	just	as	great	a	call	to	be	there	as	Tom's	father	can	feel</p>
<p class="calibre1">—just	as	pressing	a	demand	and	desire.	There	may	have	been	foul	play.	At	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">rate,	the	thing	was	done	by	an	active	agency,	and	Tom	was	taken	in	some	way	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 disadvantage.	 There	 was	 no	 fair	 fight,	 I'll	 swear.	 He	 was	 evidently	 kneeling, calmly	 enough	 looking	 out	 of	 the	 window,	 when	 he	 died,	 and	 the	 blow	 must have	been	a	coward's	blow,	struck	from	behind,	whoever	struck	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	was	no	blow,	Henry,"	said	Sir	Walter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Death	is	a	blow,	uncle—the	most	awful	blow	a	strong	man	can	be	called	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">suffer,	 surely.	 And	 I	 beg	 this,	 that	 if	 you	 won't	 let	 me	 face	 the	 infernal	 thing alone	 you'll	 let	 me	 share	 this	 business	 with	 Mr.	 May.	 He	 can	 pray	 and	 I	 can—</p>
<p class="calibre1">watch." </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	the	dead	man's	father	made	short	work	of	Henry's	proposition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	are	introducing	that	very	element	of	rationalism	to	be,	before	all	things, distrusted	here.	The	mere	introduction	of	human	precaution	and	human	weapons</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	sully	faith	and	make	of	no	avail	the	only	sure	means	of	winning	light	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	 solemn	 problem.	 Reason,	 so	 employed,	 would	 be	 a	 hindrance—an	 actual</p>
<p class="calibre1">danger.	Only	absolute	faith	can	unravel	the	mystery	before	us." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then,	 frankly,	 I	 tell	 you	 that	 I	 lack	 any	 such	 absolute	 faith,"	 declared	 Sir Walter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	 not	 say	 that—you	 libel	 yourself	 and	 are	 letting	 a	 base	 and	 material	 fear cloud	your	own	trust,"	answered	May.	"As	there	is	no	human	reason	for	what	has happened,	so	no	human	reason	will	be	found	to	explain	it.	By	denying	me,	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	 denying	 the	 sole	 means	 by	 which	 this	 dark	 terror	 can	 be	 banished.	 You	 are denying	God's	offer	of	peace.	We	must	not	only	seek	peace,	but	ensure	it.	That</p>
<p class="calibre1">means	 that	 we	 are	 now	 called	 to	 take	 such	 steps	 as	 the	 Almighty	 puts	 at	 our service	by	the	road	of	conscience	and	faith.	I	have	a	right	to	this	revelation	as	my boy's	father.	The	cup	is	mine,	and	you	will	do	very	wrongly	if	you	deny	me	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">right	 to	 drink	 it.	 I	 desire	 to	 say,	 'Peace	 be	 to	 this	 house'	 before	 I	 leave	 it,	 and, Christian	to	Christian,	you	cannot	deny	me,	or	hesitate	as	to	your	answer." </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	argument	would	bend	his	obstinate	conviction,	and	he	debated	with	great</p>
<p class="calibre1">force	from	his	own	standpoint.	He	presented	a	man	overmastered	and	mentally</p>
<p class="calibre1">incapable	of	appreciating	any	argument	against	his	possession. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 Sir	 Walter,	 now	 determined,	 was	 as	 obstinate	 as	 the	 clergyman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mannering	 bluntly	 declared	 that	 it	 would	 be	 suicide	 on	 May's	 part,	 and	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p63"></a>conniving	at	the	same	by	any	who	permitted	him	to	attempt	his	vigil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I,	 too,	 must	 do	 my	 duty	 as	 I	 see	 it,"	 summed	 up	 the	 master	 of	 Chadlands, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"and	 after	 I	 have	 done	 so,	 then	 we	 may	 be	 in	 a	 position	 to	 admit	 the	 case	 is altered." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	other	suddenly	rose	and	lifted	his	hands.	He	was	trembling	with	emotion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"May	my	God	give	a	sign,	then!"	he	cried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	silent	a	moment,	for	courtesy	or	astonishment.	Nothing	happened, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	presently	Sir	Walter	spoke:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	must	bear	with	me.	You	are	upset,	and	scarcely	know	the	gravity	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">things	you	say.	To-morrow	the	physical	and	material	investigation	that	I	consider</p>
<p class="calibre1">proper,	and	the	world	has	a	right	to	demand,	will	be	made—in	a	spirit,	I	hope,	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">earnest	 and	 devout	 as	 your	 own.	 And	 if	 after	 that	 no	 shadow	 of	 explanation	 is forthcoming,	and	no	peril	to	life	can	be	discovered,	then	I	should	feel	disposed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">consider	your	views	more	seriously—with	many	reserves,	however.	At	any	rate, </p>
<p class="calibre1">it	will	be	your	turn	then,	if	you	still	adhere	to	your	opinions;	and	I	am	sure	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	persons	who	hear	of	your	purpose	would	join	their	prayers	with	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your	faith	is	weak,	though	you	believe	it	strong,"	answered	the	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	he	was	equally	curt	when	the	physician	advised	him	to	take	a	sleeping-</p>
<p class="calibre1">draught	 before	 retiring.	 He	 bade	 them	 "Good-night"	 without	 more	 words,	 and went	 to	 his	 room,	 while	 after	 further	 conversation,	 Dr.	 Mannering	 and	 Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prodgers	took	their	leave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 former	 strongly	 urged	 Sir	 Walter	 to	 set	 some	 sort	 of	 guard	 outside	 the door	of	the	Grey	Room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	man's	not	wholly	sane	to-night,"	he	declared,	"and	he	appears	to	glory in	 the	 fact	 that	 he	 isn't.	 He	 must	 surely	 be	 aware	 that	 much	 he	 said	 was superstitious	 bosh.	 Look	 after	 him.	 Guard	 his	 own	 apartment.	 That	 will	 be	 the simplest	plan." </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 they	 had	 gone,	 Sir	 Walter	 addressed	 his	 nephew.	 They	 went	 upstairs</p>
<p class="calibre1">together	 and	 stood	 for	 a	 moment	 outside	 the	 Grey	 Room.	 The	 door	 was	 wide open,	and	the	place	brilliantly	lighted	by	a	high-powered	bulb.	So	had	it	been	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">night	ever	since	the	disaster.	None	of	the	household	entered	it,	and	none,	save	Sir</p>
<p class="calibre1">Walter	or	Henry,	was	willing	to	do	so	until	more	should	be	known. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	have	your	word	of	honor	you	will	not	go	into	that	room	to-night,"	said	his uncle;	"but	such	is	the	mental	condition	of	this	poor	clergyman	that	I	can	but	feel Mannering	is	right.	May	might,	from	some	fancied	call	of	the	spirit,	take	the	law</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	his	own	hands	and	do	what	he	wishes	to	do.	This	must	be	prevented	at	any</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>cost.	I	will	ask	you,	Henry,	to	follow	the	doctor's	suggestion	on	my	behalf,	and keep	 guard	 over	 him.	 Oppose	 him	 actively	 if	 he	 should	 appear,	 and	 call	 me.	 I would	 suggest	 that	 Caunter	 or	 Masters	 accompanied	 you,	 but	 that	 is	 only	 to make	gossip	and	mystery." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"On	no	account.	I'll	look	after	him.	You	can	trust	me.	I	expect	he's	pretty	worn out	 after	 such	 a	 harrowing	 day,	 poor	 old	 beggar.	 He'll	 probably	 sleep	 soundly enough	when	he	gets	to	bed." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	trust	so.	I	cannot	offer	to	aid	you	myself,	for	I	am	dead	beat,"	said	the	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 they	 parted,	 and	 the	 younger	 presently	 took	 up	 a	 position	 in	 the	 west wing	of	the	house,	where	Septimus	May	had	his	bedroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	until	sunrise	did	Henry	Lennox	go	to	his	own	chamber,	but	his	sleepless</p>
<p class="calibre1">night	proved	a	needless	precaution,	for	Septimus	May	gave	no	sign. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	V.	THE	UNSEEN	MOVES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	 ten	 o'clock	 on	 the	 following	 morning	 Peter	 Hardcastle,	 who	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">travelled	by	the	night	train	from	Paddington,	was	at	Chadlands.	A	car	had	gone</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	Newton	Abbot	to	meet	him,	as	no	train	ran	on	the	branch	line	until	a	later</p>
<p class="calibre1">hour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	history	of	the	detective	was	one	of	hard	work,	crowned	at	last	by	a	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">remarkable	 success.	 His	 opportunity	 had	 come,	 and	 he	 had	 grasped	 it.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">accident	of	the	war	and	the	immense	publicity	given	to	his	capture	of	a	German</p>
<p class="calibre1">secret	 agent	 had	 brought	 him	 into	 fame,	 and	 raised	 him	 to	 the	 heights	 of	 his profession.	 Moreover,	 the	 extraordinary	 histrionic	 means	 taken	 to	 achieve	 his purpose,	 and	 the	 picturesqueness	 of	 the	 details,	 captured	 that	 latent	 love	 of romance	 common	 to	 all	 minds.	 Hardcastle	 had	 become	 a	 lion;	 women	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">foolish	about	him;	he	might	have	made	a	great	match	and	retired	into	private	life</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	he	desired	to	do	so.	At	the	present	time	an	American	heiress	ardently	wished</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	wed	the	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	he	was	not	fond	of	women,	and	only	in	love	with	his	business.	A	hard	life</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 seamy	 places	 of	 the	 world	 had	 made	 him	 something	 of	 a	 cynic.	 He	 had always	 appreciated	 his	 own	 singular	 powers,	 and	 consciousness	 of	 ability, </p>
<p class="calibre1">combined	with	a	 steadfast	patience	and	 unconquerable	devotion	to	 his	"art,"	as he	called	it,	had	brought	him	through	twenty	years	in	the	police	force.	He	began</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 the	 bottom	 and	 reached	 the	 top.	 He	 was	 the	 son	 of	 a	 small	 shopkeeper,	 and now	that	his	father	was	dead	his	mother	still	ran	a	little	eating-house	for	her	own</p>
<p class="calibre1">satisfaction	and	occupation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peter	 Hardcastle	 was	 forty.	 He	 had	 already	 made	 arrangements	 to	 leave</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scotland	Yard	and	set	up,	single-handed,	as	a	private	inquiry	agent.	The	mystery</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	Chadlands	would	be	the	last	case	to	occupy	him	as	a	Government	servant.	In	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">measure	he	regretted	the	fact,	for	the	death	of	Captain	Thomas	May,	concerning</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	every	known	particular	was	now	in	his	possession,	attracted	him,	and	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew	the	incident	had	been	widely	published.	It	was	a	popular	mystery,	and,	as	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	of	business,	he	well	understood	the	professional	value	of	such	sensations	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 man	 who	 resolves	 the	 puzzle.	 His	 attitude	 toward	 the	 case	 appeared	 at	 the outset,	 and	 Sir	 Walter,	 who	 had	 been	 deeply	 impressed	 by	 the	 opinions	 of	 the dead	 man's	 father,	 and	 even	 unconsciously	 influenced	 by	 them,	 now	 found</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself	 in	 the	 presence	 of	 a	 very	 different	 intellect.	 There	 was	 nothing	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>least	superstitious	about	Peter	Hardcastle.	He	uttered	the	views	of	a	remorseless realist,	and	at	the	outset	committed	himself	to	certain	definite	assumptions.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">inhabitants	 of	 the	 manor	 house	 were	 informed	 that	 a	 friend	 of	 Sir	 Walter's	 had come	to	visit	Chadlands,	and	they	saw	nothing	to	make	them	doubt	it.	For	Peter</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 a	 great	 actor.	 He	 had	 mixed	 with	 all	 classes,	 and	 the	 detective	 had	 the imitative	 cleverness	 to	 adapt	 himself	 in	 speech	 and	 attire	 to	 every	 society.	 He even	claimed	that	he	could	think	with	the	brains	of	anybody	and	adapt	his	inner</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind,	 as	 well	 as	 his	 outer	 shape,	 to	 the	 changing	 environment	 of	 his	 activities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 appreciated	 the	 histrionics	 that	 operate	 out	 of	 sight,	 and	 would	 adopt	 the blank	 purview	 of	 the	 ignorant,	 the	 deeper	 attitude	 of	 the	 cultured,	 or	 the	 solid posture	 of	 that	 class	 whose	 education	 and	 inherent	 opinions	 is	 based	 upon tradition.	 He	 had	 made	 a	 study	 of	 the	 superficial	 etiquette	 and	 manners	 and customs	 of	 what	 is	 called	 "the	 best"	 society,	 and	 knew	 its	 ways	 as	 a	 naturalist patiently	masters	the	habits	of	a	species. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chadlands	saw	a	small,	fair	man	with	scanty	hair,	a	clean-shaven	face,	a	rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">feminine	cast	of	features,	a	broad	forehead,	slate-grey	eyes,	and	a	narrow,	lipless</p>
<p class="calibre1">mouth	 which	 revealed	 very	 fine	 white	 teeth	 when	 he	 spoke.	 It	 was	 a	 colorless face	 and	 challenged	 no	 attention;	 but	 it	 was	 a	 face	 that	 served	 as	 an	 excellent canvas,	and	few	professional	actors	had	ever	surpassed	Peter	in	the	art	of	making</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	their	features. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Similarly	 he	 could	 disguise	 his	 voice,	 the	 natural	 tones	 of	 which	 were	 low, monotonous,	and	of	no	arrestive	quality.	Mr.	Hardcastle	surprised	Sir	Walter	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 commonplace	 appearance	 and	 seeming	 youth,	 for	 he	 looked	 ten	 years</p>
<p class="calibre1">younger	 than	 the	 forty	 he	 had	 lived.	 A	 being	 so	 undistinguished	 rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappointed	his	elder,	for	the	master	of	Chadlands	had	imagined	that	any	man	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">such	wide	celebrity	must	offer	superficial	marks	of	greatness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	here	was	one	so	insignificant	and	so	undersized	that	it	seemed	impossible</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	imagine	him	a	famous	Englishman.	His	very	voice,	in	its	level,	matter-of-fact</p>
<p class="calibre1">tones,	added	to	the	suggestion	of	mediocrity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter	found,	however,	that	the	detective	did	not	undervalue	himself.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	not	arrogant,	but	revealed	decision	and	immense	will	power.	From	the	first</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	imposed	his	personality,	and	made	people	forget	the	accidents	of	his	physical</p>
<p class="calibre1">constitution.	 He	 said	 very	 little	 during	 breakfast,	 but	 listened	 with	 attention	 to the	conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	observed	that	Henry	Lennox	spoke	seldom,	but	studied	him	unobtrusively, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 a	 man	 concerning	 whom	 he	 specially	 desired	 to	 know	 more.	 Hardcastle</p>
<p class="calibre1">proved	 himself	 well	 educated;	 indeed,	 his	 reading,	 studiously	 pursued,	 and	 his intellectual	 attainments,	 developed	 by	 hard	 work	 and	 ambition,	 far	 exceeded</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a>those	of	any	present. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 clergyman	 returned	 to	 his	 own	 ground,	 and	 expressed	 his	 former</p>
<p class="calibre1">opinions,	 to	 which	 Hardcastle	 listened	 without	 a	 shadow	 of	 the	 secret	 surprise they	awoke	in	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 Witchcraft	 Act	 assumes	 that	 there	 can	 be	 no	 possible	 communication between	 living	 men	 and	 spirits,"	 he	 said	 in	 answer	 to	 an	 assertion;	 whereon Septimus	May	instantly	took	up	the	challenge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	 fatuous,	 archaic	 assumption,	 and	 long	 since	 destroyed	 by	 actual,	 human experience,"	 he	 replied.	 "It	 is	 time	 such	 blasphemous	 folly	 should	 be	 banished from	 the	 Statute	 Book.	 I	 say	 'blasphemous'	 because	 such	 an	 Act	 takes	 no</p>
<p class="calibre1">cognizance	of	the	Word	of	God.	Outworn	Acts	of	Parliament	are	responsible	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	great	deal	of	needless	misery	in	this	world,	and	it	is	high	time	these	ordinances</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	another	generation	were	sent	to	the	dust	heap." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In	that	last	opinion	I	heartily	agree	with	you,"	declared	the	detective. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	 ventured	 a	 quotation.	 He	 was	 much	 interested	 to	 learn	 whether</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hardcastle	had	any	views	on	the	ghost	theory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Goethe	 says	 that	 matter	 cannot	 exist	 without	 spirit,	 or	 spirit	 without	 matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Would	you	sub-scribe	to	that,	Mr.	Hardcastle?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Partially.	 Matter	 can	 exist	 without	 spirit,	 which	 you	 may	 prove	 by	 getting under	 an	 avalanche;	 but	 I	 do	 most	 emphatically	 agree	 that	 spirit	 cannot	 exist without	matter.	'Divorced	from	matter,	where	is	life?'	asks	Tyndall,	and	nobody</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	answer	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	misunderstand	Goethe,"	declared	Mr.	May.	"In	metaphysics—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 have	 no	 use	 for	 metaphysics.	 Believe	 me,	 the	 solemn	 humbug	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">metaphysics	 doesn't	 take	 in	 a	 policeman	 for	 a	 moment.	 Juggling	 with	 words never	 advanced	 the	 world's	 welfare	 or	 helped	 the	 cause	 of	 truth.	 What,	 for	 any practical	purpose,	does	it	matter	how	subjectively	true	a	statement	may	be	if	it	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">objectively	false?	Life	is	just	as	real	as	I	am	myself—no	more	and	no	less—and</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	 the	 metaphysical	 jargon	 in	 the	 world	 won't	 prevent	 my	 shins	 from	 bleeding wet,	red	blood	when	I	bark	them	against	a	stone." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	don't	believe	in	the	supernatural	then?"	asked	Mr.	May. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Most	emphatically	not." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	extraordinary!	And	how,	if	I	may	ask,	do	you	fill	the	terrible	vacuum	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	life	that	such	a	denial	must	create?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 have	 never	 been	 conscious	 of	 such	 a	 vacuum.	 I	 was	 a	 sceptic	 from	 my youth	up.	No	doubt	those	who	were	nurtured	in	superstition,	when	reason	at	last</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>conquers	 and	 they	 break	 away,	 may	 experience	 a	 temporary	 blank;	 but	 the wonders	of	nature	and	the	achievements	of	man	and	the	demands	of	the	suffering</p>
<p class="calibre1">world—these	should	be	enough	to	fill	any	blank	for	a	reasonable	creature." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	 such	 are	 your	 opinions,	 you	 will	 fail	 here,"	 declared	 the	 clergyman positively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why	do	you	feel	so	sure	of	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Because	you	are	faced	with	facts	that	have	no	material	explanation.	They	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">supernatural,	or	supernormal,	if	you	prefer	the	word." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'One	 world	 at	 a	 time,'	 is	 a	 very	 good	 motto	 in	 my	 judgment,"	 replied Hardcastle.	"We	will	exhaust	the	possibilities	of	this	world	first,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	 have	 already	 been	 exhausted.	 Only	 a	 simple,	 straightforward	 question awaits	your	reply.	Do	you	believe	in	another	world	or	do	you	not?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In	the	endless	punishment	or	the	endless	happiness	of	men	and	women	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	are	dead?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	you	like	to	confuse	the	issue	in	that	way	you	are	at	liberty,	of	course,	to	do so.	As	a	Christian,	I	cannot	demur.	The	problem	for	the	rationalist	is	this:	How</p>
<p class="calibre1">does	he	ignore	the	deeply	rooted	and	universal	conviction	that	there	is	a	life	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">come?	 Is	 such	 a	 sanguine	 assurance	 planted	 in	 the	 mind	 of	 even	 the	 lowest savage	for	nothing?	Where	did	the	aborigines	win	that	expectation?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My	 answer	 embraces	 the	 whole	 question	 from	 my	 own	 point	 of	 view," </p>
<p class="calibre1">replied	 Hardcastle.	 "The	 savages	 got	 their	 idea	 of	 dual	 personality	 from phenomena	 of	 nature	 which	 they	 were	 unable	 to	 explain—from	 their	 dreams, </p>
<p class="calibre1">from	their	own	shadows	on	the	earth	and	reflections	in	water,	from	the	stroke	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 lightning	 and	 the	 crash	 of	 the	 thunder,	 from	 the	 echo	 of	 their	 own	 voices, thrown	 back	 to	 them	 from	 crags	 and	 cliffs.	 These	 things	 created	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1">superstitions.	Ignorance	bred	terror,	and	terror	bred	gods	and	demons—first	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 forces	 of	 nature.	 That	 is	 the	 appalling	 mental	 legacy	 handed	 down	 in varying	shapes	to	all	the	children	of	men.	We	labor	under	them	to	this	day." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	would	dare	to	say	our	most	sacred	verities	have	sprung	from	the	dreams</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	savages?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hardcastle	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	 is	 true.	 And	 dreams,	 we	 further	 know,	 are	 often	 the	 result	 of	 indigestion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Early	 man	 didn't	 understand	 the	 art	 of	 cookery,	 and	 therefore	 no	 doubt	 his stomach	 had	 a	 great	 deal	 to	 put	 up	 with.	 We	 have	 to	 thank	 his	 bear	 steaks	 and wolf	chops	for	a	great	deal	of	our	cherished	nonsense,	no	doubt." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	 Walter,	 marking	 the	 clergyman's	 flashing	 eyes,	 changed	 the	 subject,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a>Septimus	 May,	 who	 observed	 his	 concern,	 restrained	 a	 bitter	 answer.	 But	 he despaired	 of	 the	 detective	 from	 that	 moment,	 and	 proposed	 to	 himself	 a	 future assault	on	such	detested	modern	opinions	when	opportunity	occurred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	breakfast	Mr.	Hardcastle	begged	for	a	private	interview	with	the	master</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	Chadlands,	and	for	two	hours	sat	in	his	study	and	took	him	through	the	case</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	beginning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 put	 various	 questions	 concerning	 the	 members	 of	 the	 recent	 house	 party, and	presently	begged	that	Henry	Lennox	might	join	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 should	 like	 to	 hear	 the	 account	 of	 what	 passed	 on	 the	 night	 between	 him and	Captain	May,"	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	 joined	 them,	 and	 detailed	 his	 experience.	 While	 he	 talked,	 Hardcastle appraised	him,	and	perceived	that	certain	nebulous	opinions,	which	had	begun	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">crystallize	 in	 his	 own	 mind,	 could	 have	 no	 real	 foundation.	 The	 detective believed	that	he	was	confronted	with	a	common	murder,	and	on	hearing	Henry's</p>
<p class="calibre1">history,	as	part	of	Sir	Walter's	story	with	the	rest,	perceived	that	the	old	lover	of Mary	Lennox	had	last	seen	her	husband	alive,	had	drunk	with	him,	and	been	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">first	 to	 find	 him	 dead.	 Might	 not	 Henry	 have	 found	 an	 eastern	 poison	 in Mesopotamia?	 But	 his	 conversation	 with	 the	 young	 man,	 and	 the	 unconscious</p>
<p class="calibre1">revelation	of	Henry	himself,	shattered	the	idea.	Lennox	was	innocent	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 a	 moment,	 the	 information	 of	 uncle	 and	 nephew	 exhausted,	 Hardcastle</p>
<p class="calibre1">returned	to	the	matter	of	the	breakfast	discussion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	 will,	 of	 course,	 understand	 that	 I	 am	 quite	 satisfied	 a	 material	 and physical	 explanation	 exists	 for	 this	 unfortunate	 event,"	 he	 said.	 "I	 need	 hardly tell	you	that	I	am	unprepared	to	entertain	any	supernatural	theory	of	the	business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	don't	believe	myself	in	ghosts,	because	in	my	experience,	and	it	is	pretty	wide, </p>
<p class="calibre1">ghost	 stories	 break	 down	 badly	 under	 anything	 like	 skilled	 and	 independent examination.	 There	 is	 a	 natural	 reason	 for	 what	 has	 happened,	 as	 there	 is	 a natural	 reason	 for	 everything	 that	 happens.	 We	 talk	 of	 unnatural	 things</p>
<p class="calibre1">happening,	 but	 that	 is	 a	 contradiction	 in	 terms.	 Nothing	 can	 happen	 that	 is	 not natural.	 What	 we	 call	 Nature	 embraces	 every	 conceivable	 action	 or	 event	 or possibility.	We	may	fail	to	fathom	a	mystery,	and	we	know	that	a	thousand	things</p>
<p class="calibre1">happen	every	day	and	night	that	seem	beyond	the	power	of	our	wits	to	explain; </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	that	is	only	to	say	our	wits	are	limited.	I	hold,	however,	that	very	few	things</p>
<p class="calibre1">happen	 which	 do	 not	 yield	 an	 explanation,	 sooner	 or	 later,	 if	 approached	 by those	 best	 trained	 to	 examine	 them	 without	 predisposition	 or	 prejudice.	 And	 I earnestly	hope	that	this	tragic	business	will	give	up	its	secret." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"May	you	prove	the	correctness	of	your	opinions,	Mr.	Hardcastle,"	answered</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p70"></a>Sir	Walter.	"Would	you	like	to	see	the	Grey	Room	now?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	should;	though	I	tell	you	frankly	it	is	not	in	the	Grey	Room	that	I	shall	find what	 I	 seek.	 It	 does	 not	 particularly	 interest	 me,	 and	 for	 this	 reason.	 I	 do	 not associate	 Captain	 May's	 death	 in	 any	 way	 with	 the	 earlier	 tragedy—that	 of	 the hospital	nurse,	Mrs.	Forrester.	It	is	a	coincidence,	in	my	opinion,	and	probably,	if physiology	were	a	more	perfect	science	than,	in	my	experience	of	post-mortem</p>
<p class="calibre1">examinations,	 it	 has	 proved	 to	 be,	 the	 reason	 for	 the	 lady's	 death	 would	 have appeared.	And,	for	that	matter,	the	reason	for	Captain	May's	death	also.	To	say</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	 was	 no	 reason	 is,	 of	 course,	 absurd.	 Nothing	 ever	 yet	 happened,	 or	 could happen,	 without	 a	 reason.	 The	 springs	 of	 action	 were	 arrested	 and	 the	 machine instantly	ran	down.	But	a	man	is	not	a	clock,	which	can	be	stopped	and	reveal	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">sign	of	the	thing	that	stopped	it.	Life	is	a	far	more	complex	matter	than	a	watch-</p>
<p class="calibre1">spring,	 and	 if	 we	 knew	 more	 we	 might	 not	 be	 faced	 with	 so	 many	 worthless post-mortem	 reports.	 But	 Sir	 Howard	 Fellowes	 is	 not	 often	 beaten.	 I	 repeat, however,	I	do	not	associate	the	two	deaths	in	the	Grey	Room	or	connect	them	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	result	of	one	and	the	same	cause.	I	do	not	state	this	as	a	fact	beyond	dispute, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 that,	 for	 the	 present,	 is	 my	 assumption.	 The	 gap	 in	 time	 seems	 too</p>
<p class="calibre1">considerable.	I	suspect	other	causes,	and	shall	have	to	make	researches	into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dead	man's	past	life.	I	should	wish	also	to	examine	all	his	property.	He	has	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 foreign	 countries,	 and	 may	 have	 brought	 back	 something	 concerning	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">nature	of	which	he	was	ignorant.	He	may	possess	enemies,	of	whom	neither	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">nor	 Mrs.	 May	 have	 heard	 anything.	 Your	 knowledge	 of	 him,	 recollect,	 extends over	only	a	short	time—eight	or	ten	months,	I	suppose.	I	shall	visit	his	ship	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	cabin	in	H.	M.	S.	Indomitable	also,	and	learn	all	that	his	fellow	officers	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter	looked	at	his	watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	is	now	nearly	one	o'clock,"	he	said,	"and	at	two	we	usually	take	luncheon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	would	you	wish	to	do	between	now	and	then?	None	here	but	ourselves	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 butler—an	 old	 friend	 in	 all	 my	 secrets—knows	 you	 have	 come</p>
<p class="calibre1">professionally.	I	concealed	the	fact	and	called	you	'Forbes,'	at	your	wish,	though</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	cannot	fail	to	suspect,	I	fear." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank	you.	I	will	see	the	room,	then,	and	look	round	the	place.	Perhaps	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">luncheon,	 if	 she	 feels	 equal	 to	 the	 task,	 Mrs.	 May	 will	 give	 me	 a	 private interview.	I	want	to	learn	everything	possible	concerning	your	late	son-in-law—</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	career	before	Jutland,	his	philosophy	of	life,	his	habits	and	his	friends." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	will	very	gladly	tell	you	everything	she	can." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	ascended	to	the	Grey	Room. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>"Not	the	traditional	haunt	of	spooks,	certainly,"	said	Peter	Hardcastle	as	they entered	 the	 bright	 and	 cheerful	 chamber.	 The	 day	 was	 clear,	 and	 from	 the southern	window	unclouded	sunshine	came. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothing	is	changed?"	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothing.	The	room	remains	as	it	has	been	for	many	years." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kindly	describe	exactly	where	Captain	May	was	found.	Perhaps	Mr.	Lennox</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	imitate	his	posture,	if	he	remembers	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Remember	 it!	 I	 shall	 never	 forget	 it,"	 said	 Henry.	 "I	 first	 saw	 him	 from below.	He	was	looking	out	of	the	open	window	and	kneeling	here	on	this	seat." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let	us	open	the	window	then." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 situation	 and	 attitude	 of	 the	 dead	 on	 discovery	 were	 imitated,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hardcastle	examined	the	spot.	Then	he	himself	occupied	the	position	and	looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	will	ask	for	a	ladder	presently,	and	examine	the	face	of	the	wall.	Ivy,	I	see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ivy	has	told	me	some	very	interesting	secrets	before	to-day,	Sir	Walter." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	dare	say	it	has." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	you	will	remind	me	at	luncheon,	I	can	tell	you	a	truly	amazing	story	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">ivy—a	story	of	life	and	death.	A	man	could	easily	go	and	come	by	this	window." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	easily	I	think,"	said	Henry.	"It	is	rather	more	than	thirty-five	feet	to	the ground." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	do	you	know	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 police,	 who	 made	 the	 original	 inquiry	 and	 were	 stopped,	 as	 you	 will remember,	from	Scotland	Yard,	measured	it	the	second	morning	afterwards—on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Monday." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	they	did	not	examine	the	face	of	the	wall?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	think	not.	They	dropped	a	measure	from	the	window." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	other	pursued	his	examination	of	the	room.	"Old	furniture,"	he	said;	"very old	evidently." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	was	collected	in	Spain	by	my	grandfather	many	years	ago." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Valuable,	no	doubt?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	understand	so." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wonderful	carving.	And	this	door?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	is	not	a	door,	but	a	cupboard	in	the	solid	wall." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter	opened	the	receptacle	as	he	spoke.	The	cupboard—some	six	and	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a>half	feet	high—was	empty.	At	the	back	of	it	appeared	a	row	of	pegs	for	clothes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	can	finish	with	the	room	for	the	present	at	any	rate,	in	an	hour,	gentlemen," </p>
<p class="calibre1">said	Hardcastle.	"I'll	spend	the	time	here	till	luncheon.	Had	your	son-in-law	any interest	in	old	furniture,	Sir	Walter?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"None	whatever	to	my	knowledge.	He	was	interested,	poor	fellow,	not	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">contents,	 but	 in	 the	 evil	 reputation	 of	 the	 room.	 Its	 bad	 name	 dated	 back	 far beyond	the	occupation	of	my	family.	Captain	May	laughed	at	my	mistrust,	and, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 you	 know,	 he	 came	 here,	 contrary	 to	 my	 express	 wishes,	 in	 order	 that	 he might	 chaff	 me	 next	 morning	 over	 my	 superstition.	 He	 wanted	 'to	 clear	 its character,'	as	he	said." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hardcastle	was	turning	over	the	stack	of	old	oil-paintings	in	tarnished	frames. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Family	portraits?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	mistrusted	the	room	yourself,	Sir	Walter?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"After	 Nurse	 Forrester's	 death	 I	 did.	 Not	 before.	 But	 while	 attaching	 no importance	myself	to	the	tradition,	I	respected	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nobody	else	ever	spent	a	night	here	after	the	lady's	death?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nobody.	Of	that	I	am	quite	certain." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Have	you	not	left	the	house	since?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Frequently.	 I	 generally	 spend	 March,	 April,	 and	 May	 on	 the	 Continent—in France	or	Italy.	But	the	house	is	never	closed,	and	my	people	are	responsible	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">me.	 The	 room	 is	 always	 locked,	 and	 when	 I	 am	 not	 in	 residence	 Abraham</p>
<p class="calibre1">Masters,	my	butler,	keeps	the	key.	He	shares	my	own	feelings	so	far	as	the	Grey</p>
<p class="calibre1">Room	is	concerned." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 detective	 nodded.	 He	 was	 standing	 in	 the	 middle	 of	 the	 room	 with	 his hands	in	his	pockets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	strange	fact—the	force	of	superstition,"	he	said.	"It	seems	to	feed	on	night, where	ghosts	are	involved.	What,	I	suppose,	credulous	people	call	'the	powers	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">darkness.'	 But	 have	 you	 ever	 asked	 yourself	 why	 the	 spiritualists	 must	 work	 in the	dark?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"To	simplify	their	operations,	no	doubt,	and	make	it	easier	for	the	spirits." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	themselves!	But	why	is	the	night	sacred	to	apparitions	and	supernatural</p>
<p class="calibre1">phenomena	generally?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tradition	 associates	 them	 with	 those	 hours.	 Spiritualists	 say	 it	 is	 easier	 for spectres	to	appear	in	the	dark	by	reason	of	their	material	composition.	It	is	then</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a>that	we	find	the	most	authentic	accounts	of	their	manifestations." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes;	because	at	that	time	human	vitality	is	lowest	and	human	reason	weakest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Darkness	itself	has	a	curious	and	depressing	effect	on	the	minds	of	many	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 have	 won	 my	 advantage	 from	 that	 more	 than	 once.	 I	 once	 proved	 a	 very notorious	crime	by	the	crude	expedient	of	impersonating	the	criminal's	victim—</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	murdered	woman—and	appearing	to	him	at	night	before	a	concealed	witness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 spirits	 are	 doomed.	 The	 present	 extraordinary	 wave	 of	 superstition	 and	 the immense	 prosperity	 of	 the	 dealers	 in	 the	 'occult'	 is	 a	 direct	 result	 of	 the	 war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 are	 profiteers—every	 one	 of	 them—crystal	 gazers,	 mediums,	 fortune</p>
<p class="calibre1">tellers,	and	the	rest.	They	are	reaping	a	rare	harvest	for	the	moment.	We	punish</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	humbler	rogues,	but	we	don't	punish	the	fools	who	go	to	see	them.	If	I	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	way,	the	man	or	woman	who	visited	the	modern	witch	or	wizard	should	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">six	 months	 in	 the	 second	 division.	 Fools	 should	 be	 punished	 oftener	 for	 their folly.	 But	 education	 will	 sweep	 these	 things	 into	 the	 limbo	 of	 man's	 ignorance and	mental	infancy.	Ghosts	cannot	stand	the	light	of	knowledge	any	better	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	can	operate	in	the	light	of	day." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	are	very	positive,	Mr.	Hardcastle." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	often—on	this	subject—yes,	Sir	Walter	Lennox.	I	have	seen	too	much	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	practitioners.	Metaphysics	 is	largely	to	 blame.	Physics,	the	 strong,	you	will find	far	too	merciful	to	metaphysics,	the	weak." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter	found	himself	regarding	Hardcastle	with	dislike.	He	spoke	quietly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">yet	there	was	something	mocking	and	annoying	in	his	dogmatism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	 must	 discuss	 the	 subject	 with	 Mr.	 May,	 who	 breakfasted	 with	 us.	 He will,	I	think,	have	no	difficulty	in	maintaining	the	contrary	opinion." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	 never	 have	 any	 difficulty—clergymen	 I	 mean—and	 argument	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	is	vain,	because	we	cannot	find	common	ground	to	start	from.	What	is	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">reverend	gentleman's	theory?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	 believes	 that	 the	 room	 holds	 an	 invisible	 and	 conscious	 presence</p>
<p class="calibre1">permitted	to	exercise	powers	of	a	physical	character	antagonistic	to	human	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 is	 guarded,	 you	 see,	 and	 will	 not	 go	 so	 far	 as	 to	 say	 whether	 this	 being	 is working	for	good	or	evil." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	it	has	done	evil,	surely?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Evil	from	our	standpoint.	But	since	the	Supreme	Creator	made	this	creature</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 well	 as	 He	 made	 us,	 therefore	 Mr.	 May	 holds	 that	 we	 are	 not	 justified	 in declaring	its	operations	are	evil—save	from	a	human	standpoint." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	was	he	related	to	Captain	Thomas	May?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a>"His	father." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peter	Hardcastle	remained	silent	for	a	moment;	then	he	spoke	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Have	you	observed	how	many	of	the	sons	of	the	clergy	go	into	the	Navy	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">Merchant	Marine?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	have	not." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	do,	however." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter	began	to	dislike	the	detective	more	than	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	will	leave	you	now,"	he	said.	"You	will	find	me	in	my	study	if	you	want me.	That	bell	communicates	with	the	servants.	The	lock	of	the	door	was	broken</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	 we	 forced	 our	 way	 in,	 and	 has	 not	 been	 mended;	 but	 you	 can	 close	 the door	 if	 you	 wish	 to	 do	 so.	 It	 has	 been	 kept	 open	 since	 and	 the	 electric	 light always	turned	on	at	night." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Many	 thanks.	 I	 will	 consider	 a	 point	 or	 two	 here	 and	 rejoin	 you.	 Was	 the chimney	examined?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No.	It	would	not	admit	a	human	being." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 Sir	 Walter	 and	 his	 nephew	 left	 the	 room,	 and	 Hardcastle,	 waiting	 until they	were	out	of	earshot,	shut	the	door	and	thrust	a	heavy	chair	against	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	heard	no	more	of	him	for	an	hour,	and	joined	Mary	and	Septimus	May, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who	 were	 walking	 on	 the	 terrace	 together.	 The	 former	 was	 eager	 to	 learn	 the detective's	opinions,	but	her	husband's	father	had	already	warned	her	that	Peter</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hardcastle	was	doomed	to	fail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 four	 walked	 up	 and	 down	 together,	 and	 Prince,	 Sir	 Walter's	 ancient</p>
<p class="calibre1">spaniel,	went	beside	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	 told	 his	 cousin	 the	 nature	 of	 their	 conversation	 and	 the	 direction	 in which	the	professional	inquiry	seemed	to	turn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	wants	to	see	you	and	hear	everything	you	can	tell	him	about	dear	Tom's</p>
<p class="calibre1">past,"	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	course	I	will	tell	him	everything;	and	what	I	do	not	know,	Mr.	May	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">remember." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	is	very	quiet	and	very	open-minded	about	some	things,	but	jolly	positive</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	 others.	 Your	 father-in-law	 won't	 get	 far	 with	 him.	 He	 scoffs	 at	 any supernatural	explanation	of	our	terrible	loss." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	May	overheard	this	remark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As	 I	 have	 already	 told	 Mary,	 his	 failure	 is	 assured.	 He	 is	 wasting	 his	 time, and	 I	 knew	 he	 probably	 would	 do	 so	 before	 he	 came.	 Not	 to	 such	 a	 man, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a>however	 clever	 he	 may	 be,	 will	 an	 explanation	 be	 vouchsafed.	 I	 would	 rather trust	an	innocent	child	to	discover	these	things	than	such	a	person.	He	is	lost	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	own	conceit	and	harbors	vain	ideas." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	 is	 something	 about	 him	 I	 cordially	 dislike	 already,"	 confessed	 Sir Walter.	 "And	 yet	 it	 is	 a	 most	 unreasonable	 dislike	 on	 my	 part,	 for	 he	 is exceedingly	well	mannered,	speaks	and	conducts	himself	like	a	gentleman,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">does	nothing	that	can	offend	the	most	sensitive." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	prejudice,	Uncle	Walter." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Perhaps	it	is,	Henry;	yet	I	rarely	feel	prejudice." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Call	 it	 rather	 an	 intuition,"	 said	 the	 clergyman.	 "What	 your	 antipathetic attitude	means	is	that	you	already	unconsciously	know	this	man	is	not	going	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">avail,	 and	 that	 his	 assumption	 of	 superiority	 in	 the	 matter	 of	 knowledge—his opinions	and	lack	of	faith—will	defeat	him	if	nothing	else	does.	He	approaches</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 problem	 in	 an	 infidel	 spirit,	 and	 consequently	 the	 problem	 will	 evade	 his skill;	 because	 such	 skill	 is	 not	 merely	 futile	 in	 this	 matter,	 but	 actually destructive." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary	 left	 them,	 and	 they	 discussed	 the	 probable	 chances	 of	 the	 detective</p>
<p class="calibre1">without	 convincing	 each	 other.	 Henry,	 who	 had	 been	 much	 impressed	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hardcastle,	argued	in	his	favor;	but	Septimus	May	was	obdurate,	and	Sir	Walter</p>
<p class="calibre1">evidently	inclined	to	agree	with	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 young	 men	 think	 the	 old	 men	 fools,	 and	 the	 old	 men	 know	 the	 young ones	are,"	said	Sir	Walter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	he	is	not	young,	uncle;	he's	forty.	He	told	me	so." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	thought	him	ten	years	less,	and	he	spoke	with	the	dogmatism	of	youth." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Only	on	that	subject." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Which	happens	to	be	the	one	subject	of	all	others	on	which	we	have	a	right	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">demand	an	open	and	reverent	mind,"	said	the	clergyman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	noticed	that	Sir	Walter	spoke	almost	spitefully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	 at	 any	 rate,	 he	 thought	 rather	 small	 beer	 of	 the	 Grey	 Room.	 He	 felt quite	sure	that	the	secret	lay	outside	it.	He	was	going	to	exhaust	the	possibilities of	the	place	in	no	time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 he	 spoke	 the	 gong	 sounded,	 and	 Prince,	 pricking	 his	 ears,	 led	 the	 way	 to the	open	French	window	of	the	dining-room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Call	 our	 friend,	 Henry,"	 said	 his	 uncle.	 And	 young	 Lennox,	 glad	 of	 the opportunity,	entered	the	house.	He	desired	a	word	with	Hardcastle	in	private,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">ascended	to	join	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>The	door	of	the	Grey	Room	was	still	closed,	and	Henry	found	some	obstacle within	 that	 prevented	 it	 from	 yielding	 to	 his	 hand.	 At	 once	 disturbed	 by	 this incident,	 he	 did	 not	 stand	 upon	 ceremony.	 He	 pushed	 the	 door,	 which	 gave before	 him,	 and	 he	 perceived	 that	 a	 heavy	 chair	 had	 been	 thrust	 against	 it.	 His noisy	 entrance	 challenged	 no	 response,	 and,	 looking	 round,	 it	 appeared	 for	 an instant	 that	 the	 room	 was	 empty;	 but,	 lowering	 his	 eyes,	 he	 saw	 first	 the detective's	 open	 notebook	 and	 stylograph	 lying	 upon	 the	 ground,	 then	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">discovered	 Peter	 Hardcastle	 himself	 upon	 his	 face	 with	 his	 arms	 stretched	 out before	him.	He	lay	beside	the	hearth,	motionless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lennox	 stooped,	 supported,	 and	 turned	 him	 over.	 He	 was	 still	 warm	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">relaxed	in	every	limb,	but	quite	unconscious	and	apparently	dead.	An	expression</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	surprise	marked	his	face,	and	the	corner	of	each	open	eye	had	not	yet	lost	its</p>
<p class="calibre1">lustre,	but	the	pupil	was	much	dilated. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	VI.	THE	ORDER	FROM	LONDON</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	Lennox	suffered	as	he	had	not	suffered	even	during	the	horrors	of	war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	the	first	time	in	his	life	he	felt	fear.	He	lowered	the	unconscious	man	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ground,	and	knew	that	he	was	dead,	for	he	had	looked	on	sudden	death	too	often</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	feel	in	any	doubt.	Others,	however,	were	not	so	ready	to	credit	this,	and	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	hastened	downstairs	with	his	evil	message,	both	Sir	Walter	and	Masters	found</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	hard	to	believe	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 he	 descended,	 his	 uncle	 and	 May	 were	 standing	 at	 the	 dining	 room</p>
<p class="calibre1">door,	waiting	for	him	and	Peter	Hardcastle.	Mary	had	just	joined	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	 dead!"	 was	 all	 the	 youth	 could	 say;	 then,	 thoroughly	 unnerved,	 he	 fell into	a	chair	and	buried	his	face	in	his	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again	through	his	agency	had	a	dead	man	been	discovered	in	the	Grey	Room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	each	case	his	had	been	the	eyes	first	to	confront	a	tragedy,	and	his	the	voice	to report	 it.	 The	 fact	 persisted	 in	 his	 mind	 with	 a	 dark	 obstinacy,	 as	 though	 some great	personal	tribulation	had	befallen	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary	stopped	with	her	cousin	and	asked	terrified	questions,	while	Sir	Walter, </p>
<p class="calibre1">calling	to	Masters,	hastened	upstairs,	followed	by	Septimus	May.	The	clergyman</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	also	agitated,	yet	in	his	concern	there	persisted	a	note	almost	of	triumph. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	is	there!"	he	cried.	"It	is	close	to	us,	watching	us,	powerless	to	touch	either you	or	me.	But	this	unhappy	sceptic	proved	an	easy	victim." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Would	 to	 God	 I	 had	 listened	 to	 you	 yesterday,"	 said	 Sir	 Walter.	 "Then	 this innocent	man	had	not	perhaps	been	snatched	from	life." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	 were	 directed	 not	 to	 listen.	 Your	 heart	 was	 hardened.	 His	 hour	 had come." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	cannot	believe	it.	We	may	restore	him.	It	is	impossible	that	he	can	be	dead</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	a	moment." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 stood	 over	 the	 detective,	 and	 Masters	 and	 Fred	 Caunter,	 with	 courage and	presence	of	mind,	carried	him	out	into	the	corridor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	butler	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Run	for	the	brandy,	Fred,"	he	said.	"We	must	get	some	down	his	neck	if	we can.	I	don't	feel	the	gentleman's	heart,	but	it	may	not	have	stopped.	He's	warm</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a>The	footman	obeyed,	and	Hardcastle	was	laid	upon	his	back.	Then	Sir	Walter directed	Masters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hold	his	head	up.	It	may	be	better	for	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 waited,	 and,	 during	 the	 few	 moments	 before	 Caunter	 returned,	 Sir</p>
<p class="calibre1">Walter	spoke	again.	 His	mind	wandered	 backward	and	seemed	 for	the	moment</p>
<p class="calibre1">incapable	of	grasping	the	fact	before	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Almost	 the	 last	 thing	 the	 man	 said	 was	 to	 ask	 me	 why	 ghosts	 haunted	 the night	rather	than	the	day." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Poor	fool—poor	fool!	He	is	answered,"	replied	the	priest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 attempts	 to	 restore	 the	 vanished	 life	 proved	 useless,	 and	 they	 carried Hardcastle	downstairs	presently.	Henry	Lennox	was	already	gone	for	the	doctor, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	when,	within	an	hour,	Mannering	joined	them,	he	could	only	pronounce	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 man	 was	 dead.	 No	 sign	 of	 life	 rewarded	 their	 protracted	 efforts	 to	 restore circulation.	How	he	had	come	by	his	end,	how	death	had	broken	into	his	frame, </p>
<p class="calibre1">it	was	impossible	to	determine.	Not	an	unusual	sign	marked	the	body.	It	revealed</p>
<p class="calibre1">neither	 wound	 nor	 outward	 evidence	 of	 shock.	 The	 case	 seemed	 parallel	 with that	 of	 Thomas	 May.	 Death	 had	 struck	 the	 man	 like	 a	 flash	 of	 lightning	 and dropped	him,	where	he	stood,	making	his	notes	by	the	fireplace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whereupon	a	complication	faced	Dr.	Mannering.	Mary	came	to	him,	where	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">spoke	in	the	library	with	Sir	Walter	and	Henry	Lennox.	She	implored	him	to	use</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	influence	with	her	father-in-law;	for	they	had	forgotten	Septimus	May,	while</p>
<p class="calibre1">hastily	 deliberating	 as	 to	 what	 telegrams	 should	 be	 dispatched;	 but	 now	 they learned	that	Mr.	May	was	in	the	Grey	Boom	and	refused	to	leave	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	is	very	excited,"	she	said.	"He	is	walking	up	and	down,	speaking	aloud, quoting	texts	from	Scripture,	addressing	the	spirit	that	he	believes	to	be	listening to	him.	It	would	be	grotesque	were	it	not	so	horrible.	He	must	be	made	to	come</p>
<p class="calibre1">away." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	is	justified	of	his	faith,"	declared	Sir	Walter.	"I	have	withstood	him	until now,	but	I	can	do	so	no	longer." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Indeed	you	must.	He	is	playing	with	death,"	said	Mannering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 sought	 Tom's	 father,	 to	 find	 him,	 as	 Mary	 had	 said,	 walking	 up	 and down,	with	fierce	joy	of	battle	on	his	thin,	stern	face	and	in	his	shining	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now	shall	the	powers	of	Light	triumph	and	the	will	of	God	be	done!"	he	said to	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	made	no	demur,	however,	when	they	drew	him	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	future	is	mine,"	he	declared,	and	grew	calm.	"You	cannot	stand	between</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a>me	and	my	duty	again,	Sir	Walter.	You	have	gravely	erred,	and	this	is	the	result of	your	error.	But	you	will	not	err	a	second	time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	excitation	ceased,	and	it	was	he	who	proposed	that	they	should	return	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 forgotten	 meal.	 In	 the	 matter	 of	 the	 man	 just	 dead,	 he	 revealed	 an indifference	almost	callous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"His	God	will	justly	judge	him	according	to	his	deserving,"	he	declared.	"If	he sinned	through	ignorance	and	false	teaching,	his	punishment	will	not	be	heavy; </p>
<p class="calibre1">if	he	hardened	his	heart	against	truth	and	rejected	the	faith	from	pride—but	even</p>
<p class="calibre1">then	 the	 Father	 of	 Mercy	 may	 pardon	 him.	 He	 has	 failed,	 even	 as	 I	 knew	 he must,	and	paid	a	terrible	penalty	for	failure." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	 Walter,	 sorely	 stricken,	 hardly	 heard	 the	 other.	 He	 ate	 a	 little	 at	 Mary's entreaty,	 then,	 driven	 by	 some	 impulse	 to	 leave	 his	 fellow-creatures	 and	 court solitude,	 excused	 himself,	 begged	 Lennox	 and	 Mannering	 to	 bring	 him	 news</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	 the	 telegram	 dispatched	 to	 Scotland	 Yard	 was	 answered,	 and	 prepared	 to leave	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	rose,	he	marked	his	old	spaniel	standing	whimpering	by	his	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	is	the	matter	with	Prince?"	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	has	not	had	his	dinner,"	said	Mary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let	him	be	fed	at	once,"	answered	her	father,	and	went	out	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	rose	to	follow	him	immediately,	but	Mannering,	who	had	stopped	and	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	them,	begged	her	not	to	do	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Leave	him	to	himself,"	he	said.	"This	has	shaken	your	father,	as	well	it	may. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He's	all	right.	Make	him	take	his	bromide	to-night,	and	let	nobody	do	anything	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">worry	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 master	 of	 Chadlands	 meantime	 went	 afield,	 walked	 half	 a	 mile	 to	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">favorite	 spot,	 and	 sat	 down	 upon	 a	 seat	 that	 he	 had	 there	 erected.	 A	 storm	 was blowing	 up	 from	 the	 south-west,	 and	 the	 weather	 of	 his	 mind	 welcomed	 it.	 He alternated	between	bewilderment	and	indignation.	His	own	life-long	philosophy</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 trust	 in	 the	 ordered	 foundations	 of	 human	 existence	 threatened	 to	 fail	 him entirely	 before	 this	 second	 stroke.	 It	 seemed	 that	 the	 punctual	 universe	 was suddenly	turned	upside	down,	and	had	emptied	a	vial	of	horror	upon	his	innocent</p>
<p class="calibre1">head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reality	was	a	thing	of	the	past.	A	nightmare	had	taken	its	place,	a	nightmare</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 which	 there	 was	 no	 waking.	 He	 considered	 the	 stability	 of	 his	 days—a lifetime	followed	upon	high	principles	and	founded	on	religious	convictions	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 comforted	 his	 sorrows	 and	 countenanced	 his	 joys.	 It	 seemed	 a	 trial</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>undeserved,	that	in	his	old	age	he	should	be	thrust	upon	a	pinnacle	of	publicity, forced	into	the	public	eye,	robbed	of	dignity,	denied	the	privacy	he	esteemed	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	most	precious	privilege	that	wealth	could	command.	Stability	was	destroyed; </p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 count	 upon	 the	 morrow	 seemed	 impossible.	 His	 thought,	 strung	 to	 a	 new morbidity,	unknown	till	now,	ran	on	and	pictured,	with	painful,	vivid	stroke	upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">stroke,	the	insufferable	series	of	events	that	lay	before	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Life	 was	 become	 a	 bizarre	 and	 brutal	 business	 for	 a	 man	 of	 fine	 feeling.	 He would	 be	 thrust	 into	 the	 pitiless	 mouth	 of	 sensation-mongers,	 called	 to	 appear before	tribunals,	subjected	to	an	inquisition	of	his	fellow-men,	made	to	endure	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">notoriety	 infinitely	 odious	 even	 in	 anticipation.	 Indeed,	 Sir	 Walter's	 simple intellect	wallowed	in	 anticipation,	and	so	 suffered	much	that,	 given	exercise	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">restraint,	he	might	have	escaped	altogether.	He	was	brave	enough,	but	personal</p>
<p class="calibre1">bravery	 would	 not	 be	 called	 for.	 He	 sat	 now	 staring	 dumbly	 at	 an	 imaginary series	 of	 events	 abominable	 and	 unseemly	 in	 every	 particular	 to	 his	 order	 of mind.	He	was	so	concerned	with	what	the	future	must	hold	in	store	for	him	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	a	time	the	present	quite	escaped	his	thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	returned	to	it,	however,	and	it	was	almost	with	the	shock	of	a	new	surprise</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	remembered	that	Peter	Hardcastle,	a	man	of	European	repute,	had	just	died	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 house.	 But	 he	 could	 not	 in	 the	 least	 realize	 the	 new	 tragedy.	 He	 had	 as	 yet barely	 grasped	 the	 truth	 of	 his	 son-in-law's	 end,	 and	 still	 often	 found	 himself expecting	Tom's	footfall	and	his	jolly	voice.	That	such	an	abundant	vitality	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">stilled,	that	such	an	infectious	laugh	would	never	sound	again	on	mortal	ear	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet	sometimes	found	it	hard	to	believe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	now	it	seemed	that	the	impact	of	this	second	blow	rammed	home	the	first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	brooded	upon	his	dead	son-in-law,	and	it	was	long	before	he	returned	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">event	 of	 that	 day.	 A	 thought	 struck	 him,	 and	 though	 elementary	 enough,	 it seemed	 to	 Sir	 Walter	 an	 important	 conclusion.	 There	 could	 be	 no	 shadow	 of doubt	that	Tom	May	and	Peter	Hardcastle	had	died	by	the	same	secret	force.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt	that	he	must	remember	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again	 he	 puzzled,	 and	 then	 decided	 with	 himself	 that,	 if	 he	 meant	 to	 keep sane,	he	must	practice	faith	and	trust	in	God.	Septimus	May	had	said	that	such</p>
<p class="calibre1">unparalleled	 things	 sometimes	 happened	 in	 the	 world	 to	 try	 man's	 faith. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doubtless	he	was	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henceforth	 the	 old	 man	 determined	 to	 stand	 firmly	 on	 the	 side	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">supernatural	with	the	priest.	He	went	further,	and	blamed	his	scepticism.	It	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">cost	the	world	a	valuable	life.	He	could	not,	indeed,	be	censured	for	that	in	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">court	of	inquiry.	Sceptical	men	would	doubtless	say	that	he	had	done	rightly	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">refusing	Mr.	May	his	experiment.	But	Sir	Walter	now	convinced	himself	that	he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>had	 done	 wrongly.	 At	 such	 a	 time,	 with	 landmarks	 vanishing	 and	 all	 accepted laws	 of	 matter	 resolved	 into	 chaos,	 there	 remained	 only	 God	 to	 trust.	 Such	 a burden	as	this	was	not	to	be	borne	by	any	mortal,	and	Sir	Walter	determined	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	would	not	bear	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Were	we	not	told	to	cast	our	tribulations	before	the	Almighty?	Here,	if	ever, </p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 a	 situation	 beyond	 the	 power	 of	 human	 mind	 to	 approach,	 unless	 a	 man walked	 humbly	 with	 his	 hand	 in	 his	 Maker's.	 Septimus	 May	 had	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">emphatically	 right.	 Sir	 Walter	 repeated	 this	 conviction	 to	 himself	 again	 and again,	like	a	child. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 descended	 to	 details	 presently.	 The	 hidden	 being,	 that	 it	 had	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">implicitly	agreed	could	only	operate	by	night	in	the	Grey	Room,	proved	equally</p>
<p class="calibre1">potent	under	noonday	sun.	But	why	should	it	be	otherwise?	To	limit	its	activities</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 to	 limit	 its	 powers,	 and	 the	 Almighty	 alone	 knew	 what	 powers	 had	 been granted	 to	 it.	 He	 shrank	 from	 further	 inquiries	 or	 investigations	 on	 any	 but	 a religious	 basis.	 He	 was	 now	 convinced	 that	 no	 natural	 explanation	 would	 exist for	what	had	happened	in	the	Grey	Room,	and	he	believed	that	only	through	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">paths	of	Christian	faith	would	peace	return	to	him	or	his	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 the	 present	 dropped	 out	 of	 his	 thoughts.	 They	 wandered	 into	 the	 past, and	he	concerned	himself	with	his	wife.	She	it	was	who	had	taught	him	to	care</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 foreign	 travel.	 Until	 his	 marriage	 he	 had	 hardly	 left	 England,	 save	 when yachting	with	friends,	and	an	occasional	glimpse	of	a	Mediterranean	port	was	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 Sir	 Walter	 knew	 of	 the	 earth	 outside	 his	 own	 country.	 But	 he	 remembered with	gratitude	the	opportunities	won	from	her.	He	had	taken	her	round	the	world, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	found	himself	much	the	richer	in	great	memories	for	that	experience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 was	 still	 thinking	 when	 Mary	 found	 him,	 with	 his	 old	 dog	 asleep	 at	 his feet.	 She	 brought	 him	 a	 coat	 and	 umbrella,	 for	 the	 threatened	 storm	 advanced swiftly	 under	 clouds	 laden	 with	 rain.	 Reluctantly	 enough	 he	 returned	 to	 the present.	A	telegram	had	been	received	from	London,	directing	Dr.	Mannering	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">reach	 the	 nearest	 telephone	 and	 communicate	 direct.	 The	 doctor	 was	 gone	 to Newton	 Abbot,	 and	 nothing	 could	 be	 done	 until	 he	 came	 back.	 Not	 knowing</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	 had	 occupied	 Sir	 Walter's	 mind,	 Mary	 urged	 him	 to	 leave	 Chadlands</p>
<p class="calibre1">without	delay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Put	 the	 place	 into	 the	 hands	 of	 the	 police	 and	 take	 me	 with	 you,"	 she	 said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothing	 can	 be	 gained	 by	 our	 stopping,	 and,	 after	 this,	 it	 is	 certain	 the authorities	will	not	rest	until	they	have	made	a	far	more	searching	examination</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	has	ever	yet	been	carried	out.	They	will	feel	this	disaster	a	challenge." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thankfully	I	would	go,"	he	answered.	"Most	thankfully	I	would	avoid	what</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a>is	hanging	over	my	head.	It	was	terrible	enough	when	your	dear	husband	died; but	now	we	shall	be	the	centre	of	interest	to	half	England.	Every	instinct	cries	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	to	get	out	of	it,	but	obviously	that	is	impossible,	even	were	I	permitted	to	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">so.	It	is	the	duty	of	the	police	to	suspect	every	man	and	woman	under	my	roof—</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself	 with	 the	 rest.	 These	 appalling	 things	 have	 occurred	 in	 my	 home,	 and	 I must	bear	the	brunt	of	them	and	stand	up	to	all	that	they	mean.	No	Lennox	ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">ran	 from	 his	 duty,	 however	 painful	 it	 might	 be.	 The	 death	 of	 this	 man—so eminent	 in	 his	 calling—will	 attract	 tremendous	 attention	 and	 be,	 as	 you	 say,	 a sort	of	direct	challenge	to	the	authorities	for	whom	he	worked.	They	will	resent</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	 second	 tragedy,	 and	 with	 good	 reason.	 The	 poor	 man,	 though	 I	 cannot pretend	that	I	admired	him,	was	a	force	for	good	in	the	world,	and	his	peculiar</p>
<p class="calibre1">genius	 was	 devoted	 to	 the	 detection	 of	 crime	 and	 punishment	 of	 criminals—a very	worthy	occupation,	however	painful	to	our	ideas." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 sat	 in	 the	 library	 now,	 and	 Henry	 Lennox	 spoke	 to	 his	 uncle,	 with	 his eye	on	the	window,	waiting	for	the	sight	of	the	doctor's	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They'll	 want	 to	 tear	 the	 place	 down,	 very	 likely.	 They'll	 certainly	 have	 no mercy	on	the	stones	and	mortar,	any	more	than	they	will	on	us." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	 can	 spare	 themselves	 that	 trouble,	 and	 you	 your	 fears,"	 declared Septimus	May,	who	had	joined	them.	"It	is	impossible	that	they	will	be	here	until to-morrow.	Meantime—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	is	easy	to	see	what	they	will	do,"	proceeded	young	Lennox,	"and	what	they will	 think	 also.	 Nor	 can	 we	 prevent	 them,	 even	 if	 we	 wanted	 to.	 I	 image	 their theory	 will	 be	 this.	 They	 will	 suppose	 that	 Mr.	 Hardcastle,	 left	 in	 that	 room alone,	was	actually	on	the	track	of	those	responsible	for	Tom's	death.	They	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">guess	 that,	 in	 some	 way,	 or	 by	 some	 accident,	 he	 surprised	 the	 author	 of	 the tragedy,	 and	 the	 assassin,	 seeing	 his	 danger,	 resorted	 to	 the	 same	 unknown means	 of	 murder	 as	 before.	 They	 may	 imagine	 some	 hidden	 lunatic	 concealed here,	 whose	 presence	 is	 only	 known	 to	 some	 of	 us.	 They	 may	 suspect	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">homicidal	 maniac	 in	 me,	 or	 my	 uncle,	 or	 Masters,	 or	 anybody.	 Certainly	 they will	seek	a	natural	explanation	and	flout	the	idea	of	any	other." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 clergyman	 protested,	 but	 Henry	 was	 not	 prepared	 to	 traverse	 the	 old</p>
<p class="calibre1">ground	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 have	 as	 much	 right	 to	 my	 opinions	 as	 you	 to	 yours,"	 he	 said.	 "And	 I	 am positive	this	is	man's	work." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	Mary	announced	that	Mannering's	car	was	in	sight.	The	library	windows</p>
<p class="calibre1">opened	on	the	western	side	of	the	house	and	afforded	a	view	of	the	main	drive, </p>
<p class="calibre1">along	 which	 the	 doctor's	 little	 hooded	 car	 came	 flying,	 like	 a	 dead	 leaf	 in	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a>storm.	But	it	was	not	alone.	A	hospital	motor	ambulance	followed	behind	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 soon	 learned	 of	 curious	 things,	 and	 the	 house	 was	 first	 thrown	 into	 a great	bustle	and	then	restored	to	peace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mannering	had	spoken	for	half	an	hour	with	London,	and	received	directions</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 puzzled	 him	 not	 a	 little	 by	 their	 implication.	 For	 a	 moment	 he	 seemed unwilling	to	speak	before	Mary.	Then	he	begged	her	bluntly	to	leave	them	for	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">while. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	this	way,"	he	said	when	she	was	gone.	"They're	harboring	a	mad	idea	in London,	 though,	 of	 course,	 the	 facts	 will	 presently	 convince	 them	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">contrary.	 Surely	 I	 must	 know	 death	 when	 I	 see	 it?	 But	 a	 divisional	 surgeon,	 or some	 other	 medical	 official,	 directs	 me	 to	 bring	 this	 poor	 fellow's	 body	 to London	to-night.	Every	care	must	be	taken,	warmth	and	air	applied,	and	so	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They've	evidently	got	a	notion	that,	since	life	appears	to	go	so	easily	in	the	Grey</p>
<p class="calibre1">Room,	 and	 leave	 no	 scratch	 or	 wound,	 either	 life	 has	 not	 gone	 at	 all,	 or	 that	 it may	 be	 within	 the	 power	 of	 science	 to	 bring	 it	 back	 again.	 In	 a	 sense	 this	 is	 a reflection	 upon	 me—as	 though	 it	 were	 possible	 that	 I	 could	 make	 any	 mistake between	death	and	suspended	animation;	but	I	must	do	as	I'm	ordered.	I	travel	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">town	 with	 the	 dead	 man	 to-night,	 and	 if	 they	 find	 he	 is	 anything	 but	 dead	 as	 a doornail,	I'll—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 doctor	 was	 writing	 his	 reminiscences,	 "The	 Recollections	 of	 a	 Country Physician,"	and	he	could	not	fail	to	welcome	these	events,	for	they	were	destined to	 lend	 extraordinary	 attraction	 to	 a	 volume	 otherwise	 not	 destined	 to	 be	 much out	of	the	common. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	spoke	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 should	 be	 very	 glad	 if	 you	 would	 accompany	 me,	 Lennox.	 I	 shall	 have	 a police	inspector	from	Plymouth;	but	it	would	be	a	satisfaction	if	you	could	come. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover,	you	would	help	me	in	London." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	come	up,	certainly.	You	don't	mind,	Uncle	Walter?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	 if	 Mannering	 wishes	 it.	 We	 owe	 him	 more	 than	 we	 can	 ever	 repay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anything	that	we	can	do	to	lessen	his	labors	ought	to	be	done." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 should	 certainly	 welcome	 your	 company.	 A	 small	 saloon	 carriage	 is	 to	 be put	on	to	the	Plymouth	train	that	leaves	Newton	for	London	before	midnight.	We</p>
<p class="calibre1">shall	be	met	at	Paddington	by	some	of	their	doctors.	And	as	to	Chadlands,	four</p>
<p class="calibre1">men	 arrive	 to-morrow	 morning	 by	 the	 same	 train	 that	 Peter	 Hardcastle	 came down	in	last	night.	We	shall	pass	them	on	the	way.	They	will	take	charge	both	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Grey	Room	and	the	house	as	soon	as	they	arrive." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a>"And	they	will	be	welcome.	I	would	myself	willingly	pull	down	Chadlands	to the	foundations	if	by	so	doing	I	could	discover	the	truth." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	demands	no	such	sacrifice,"	declared	May,	who	had	listened	to	these	facts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bricks	 and	 mortar,	 stone	 and	 timber	 are	 innocent	 things.	 One	 might	 as	 soon dissect	 a	 thunder-cloud	 to	 find	 the	 lightning	 as	 destroy	 material	 substances	 to discover	 what	 is	 hidden	 in	 this	 house.	 The	 unknown	 being,	 about	 his	 Master's business	 here,	 will	 no	 more	 yield	 its	 secret	 to	 four	 detectives,	 or	 an	 army	 of them,	than	it	did	to	one.	'What	I	do	thou	knowest	not	now.'	It	is	all	summed	up	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	to	Mannering	and	asked	a	sudden	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why	 did	 you	 object	 to	 Mary	 hearing	 these	 facts?	 In	 what	 way	 should	 they distress	her	particularly?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can	 you	 not	 see?	 Indeed,	 one	 might	 fairly	 have	 objected	 to	 your	 presence also.	But	you	are	a	man.	There	is	an	implied	horror	of	the	darkest	sort	for	poor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary	in	the	suggestion	that	Hardcastle	may	still	live.	If	he	can	be	brought	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	life,	then	she	would	surely	think	that	perhaps	her	husband	and	your	son	might</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	been.	Imagine	the	agony	of	that.	I	speak	plainly;	indeed,	there	is	no	rational</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	sentimental	reason	why	I	should	not,	for	the	truth	is,	of	course,	that	the	signs</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 death	 were	 clearly	 evident	 on	 your	 poor	 boy	 before	 what	 we	 had	 to	 do	 was done.	But	the	bare	thought	must	have	shocked	Mary.	We	know	emphatically	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hardcastle	 is	 dead,	 and	 we	 need	 not	 mention	 to	 her	 this	 fantastic	 theory	 from London." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 appreciate	 your	 consideration,"	 said	 Sir	 Walter;	 and	 the	 clergyman	 also acknowledged	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	can	be	no	shadow	of	doubt	concerning	my	son,"	he	said;	"nor	is	there any	in	the	matter	of	this	unfortunate	man." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	 Lennox	 went	 to	 prepare	 for	 the	 journey.	 Then,	 obeying	 the	 doctor's</p>
<p class="calibre1">directions	and	treating	the	dead	man	as	though	he	were	merely	unconscious,	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">carried	 him	 to	 the	 ambulance	 car.	 It	 was	 an	 unseemly	 farce	 in	 Mannering's opinion,	 and	 he	 only	 realized	 the	 painful	 nature	 of	 his	 task	 when	 he	 came	 to undertake	 it;	 but	 he	 carried	 it	 through	 in	 every	 particular	 as	 directed,	 conveyed the	corpse	to	Newton	after	dark,	and	had	the	ambulance	bed,	in	which	it	reposed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">borne	 to	 the	 saloon	 carriage	 when	 the	 night	 mail	 arrived	 from	 Plymouth, </p>
<p class="calibre1">between	 eleven	 and	 twelve.	 He	 was	 able	 to	 regulate	 the	 temperature	 with	 hot steam,	and	kept	hot	bottles	to	the	feet	and	sides	of	the	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	felt	impatient	and	resentful;	he	poured	scorn	on	the	superior	authority	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 benefit	 of	 the	 inspector	 and	 Henry	 Lennox,	 who	 accompanied	 him;	 but	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a>secret	 he	 experienced	 emotions	 of	 undoubted	 satisfaction	 that	 life	 had	 broken from	 its	 customary	 monotonous	 round	 to	 furnish	 him	 with	 an	 adventure	 so</p>
<p class="calibre1">unique.	He	pointed	out	a	fact	to	the	policeman	before	they	had	started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	will	observe,"	he	said,	with	satire,	"that,	despite	the	heat	we	are	directed to	apply	to	this	unfortunate	man,	rigor	mortis	has	set	in.	Whether	the	authority	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">London	regards	that	as	an	evidence	of	death,	of	course	I	cannot	pretend	to	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps	not.	I	may	be	behind	the	times." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neither	Mannering	nor	Lennox	had	spared	much	thought	for	those	left	behind</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	 at	 Chadlands.	 The	 extraordinary	 character	 of	 the	 task	 put	 upon	 them</p>
<p class="calibre1">sufficed	 to	 fill	 their	 minds,	 and	 it	 was	 not	 until	 the	 small	 hours,	 when	 they	 sat with	their	hands	in	their	pockets	and	the	train	ran	steadily	through	darkness	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">storm,	that	the	younger	spoke	of	his	cousin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	hope	those	old	men	won't	bully	Mary	to-night,"	he	said.	"I'd	meant	to	ask you	to	give	Uncle	Walter	a	caution.	May's	not	quite	all	there,	in	my	opinion,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	 likely,	 now	 you're	 out	 of	 the	 way,	 he'll	 get	 round	 Sir	 Walter	 about	 that infernal	room." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mannering	became	interested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"D'you	mean	for	an	instant	he	wants	to	try	his	luck	after	what's	happened?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	forget.	Your	day	has	been	so	full	that	you	forget	what	did	happen." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	do	not,	Lennox.	Mary	begged	me	to	tackle	the	man.	I	calmed	him,	and	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	 down	 to	 his	 luncheon.	 He	 must	 have	 thought	 over	 the	 matter	 since	 then, and	seen	that	he	was	playing	with	death." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Far	from	it,	'The	future	is	mine!'	That's	what	he	said.	And	that	means	he'll	try and	be	in	the	Grey	Room	alone	to-night." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	wish	to	Heaven	you'd	made	this	clear	before	we'd	started.	But	surely	we	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">trust	 Sir	 Walter;	 he	 knows	 what	 this	 means,	 even	 if	 that	 superstitious	 lunatic doesn't." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	want	to	bother	you,"	answered	Henry;	"but,	looking	back,	I'm	none	so sure	 that	 we	 can	 trust	 my	 uncle.	 He's	 been	 pretty	 wild	 to-day,	 and	 who	 shall blame	him?	Things	like	this	crashing	into	his	life	leave	him	guessing.	He's	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">shaken,	 and	 has	 lost	 his	 mental	 grip,	 too.	 Reality's	 played	 him	 such	 ugly	 tricks that	he	may	be	tempted	to	fall	back	on	unreality	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	don't	mean	he'll	let	May	go	into	that	room	to-night?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	hope	not.	He	was	firm	enough	last	night	when	the	clergyman	clamored	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	so.	In	fact,	he	made	me	keep	watch	to	see	he	didn't.	But	I	think	he's	weakened</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	lot	since	Hardcastle	came	to	grief	in	broad	daylight.	And	I	sha'n't	be	there	to	do</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a>anything." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	this	comes	too	late,"	answered	the	other.	"If	harm	has	happened—it	has happened.	We	can	only	pray	they've	preserved	some	sanity	among	them." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	 why	 I	 say	 I	 hope	 they're	 not	 bullying	 Mary,"	 answered	 Lennox.	 "Of course,	she'd	be	dead	against	her	father-in-law's	idea.	But	she	won't	count.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">can't	control	him	if	Sir	Walter	goes	over	to	his	side." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let	us	not	imagine	anything	so	unreasonable.	We'll	telegraph	to	hear	if	all's</p>
<p class="calibre1">well	at	the	first	moment	we	can." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	storm	sent	a	heavy	wash	of	rain	against	the	side	of	the	carriage.	It	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">famous	 tempest,	 that	 punished	 the	 South	 of	 England	 from	 Land's	 End	 to	 the North	Foreland. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	distracted	from	their	thoughts	by	the	terrific	impact	of	the	wind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wonder	we	can	stop	on	the	rails,"	said	Mannering.	"This	is	a	fifty-knot	gale, or	I'm	mistaken." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	thinking	of	the	Chadlands	trees,"	answered	the	other.	"It's	rum	how,	in	the middle	of	such	an	awful	business	as	this,	the	mind	switches	off	to	trifles.	Does	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	purpose,	I	suppose,	to	relieve	the	strain.	Yes,	the	trees	will	catch	it	to-night.	I expect	I	shall	hear	a	grim	tale	of	fallen	timber	from	Sir	Walter	by	the	time	I	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	to-morrow." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	 nothing's	 fallen	 but	 timber,	 I	 sha'n't	 mind,"	 answered	 Mannering;	 "but you've	made	me	devilish	uneasy	now.	If	anything	further	went	wrong—well,	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">put	 it	 mildly,	 they	 would	 say	 your	 uncle	 ought	 to	 have	 known	 a	 great	 deal better." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	does	know	a	great	deal	better.	It's	only	that	temporarily	he's	knocked	off</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	balance.	But	I	hardly	feel	as	anxious	as	you	do.	There's	Mary	against	May; </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 even	 if	 my	 uncle	 were	 for	 him,	 on	 a	 general,	 vague	 theory	 of	 something esoteric	 and	 outside	 nature,	 which	 you	 can't	 fairly	 call	 unreasonable	 any	 more, Mannering,	seeing	what's	 happened—even	if	Sir	 Walter	felt	tempted	 to	let	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	his	way,	I	don't	believe	he'd	really	consent	when	it	came	to	the	point." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	hope	not—I	hope	not,"	answered	the	other.	"Such	a	concession	would	take a	lot	of	explanation	if	the	result	were	another	of	these	disasters.	There	ought	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	an	official	guard	over	the	room." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"After	to-morrow	there	certainly	will	be,"	replied	Henry.	"You	may	be	sure	the police	won't	leave	it	again	till	they've	satisfied	themselves.	All	the	same,	I	don't see	how	a	dozen	of	them	will	be	any	safer	than	one—even	if	it's	some	material</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	physical	thing	that	happens,	as	we	must	suppose.	And	for	that	matter,	if	it's</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>really	 supernatural,	 why	 should	 a	 dozen	 be	 safer	 than	 one?	 Obviously	 they wouldn't.	Whatever	it	is,	it	can	strike	as	it	likes	and	without	being	struck	back." </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Dr.	Mannering	did	not	answer	these	questions.	He	was	considering	a	little</p>
<p class="calibre1">book	 in	 his	 pocket,	 which	 he	 would	 hand	 over	 to	 the	 police	 in	 London	 next morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Poor	chap—if	he	could	have	begun	by	taking	the	problem	by	the	throat,	as	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">has	written	here.	But,	instead,	it	took	him	by	the	throat!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 took	 Hardcastle's	 notebook	 from	 his	 pocket	 and	 read	 again	 the	 last	 few pages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	was	dreaming	of	his	theories	to	the	last,	when	he	should	surely	have	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">girt	up	in	every	limb	to	face	facts,"	said	Lennox.	"He	never	realized	the	horrible danger." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perusal	of	the	detective's	data	had	revealed	an	interesting	fact.	It	was	known</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	his	colleagues	that	he	designed	a	book	on	the	theory	and	practice	of	criminal</p>
<p class="calibre1">investigations,	 and	 in	 many	 of	 his	 pocket-books,	 subsequently	 examined,	 were found	 memoranda	 and	 jottings,	 doubtless	 destined	 to	 be	 worked	 out	 at	 another time.	 It	 was	 clear	 that	 he	 had,	 for	 a	 few	 moments,	 drifted	 away	 from	 the	 Grey Room	 in	 thought	 when	 his	 death	 overtook	 him.	 Past	 events,	 not	 present</p>
<p class="calibre1">problems,	were	apparently	responsible	for	the	reflections	that	occupied	his	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 was	 not	 concentrating	 on	 the	 material	 phenomena	 actually	 under	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">observation	when	he	died,	but	following	some	private	meditations	provoked	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	experiences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Elimination	 embraces	 the	 secret	 of	 success,"	 he	 had	 written.	 "Exercise	 the full	force	of	your	intelligence	and	spare	no	pains	to	eliminate	from	every	case	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter	 not	 bearing	 directly	 upon	 the	 actual	 problem.	 Nine	 times	 out	 of	 ten	 the issue	 is	 direct,	 and	 once	 permit	 side	 issues	 to	 draw	 their	 tracks	 across	 it,	 once admit	 metaphysical	 lines	 of	 reasoning,	 the	 result	 will	 be	 confusion	 and	 a problem	increasing	in	complexity	at	every	stage.	Only	in	romances,	where	a	plot</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 invented	 and	 then	 complicated	 by	 deliberate	 art,	 shall	 we	 find	 the	 truth ultimately	 permitted	 to	 appear	 in	 some	 subordinate	 incident,	 or	 individual, studiously	 kept	 in	 the	 background—that	 is	 the	 craft	 of	 telling	 detective	 stories. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But,	 in	 truth,	 one	 needs	 to	 lay	 hold	 of	 the	 problem	 by	 the	 throat	 at	 the	 outset. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Deception	is	too	much	the	province	of	the	criminal	and	too	little	the	business	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	investigator;	and	where	it	may	be	possible	to	creep,	like	a	snake,	into	a	case, </p>
<p class="calibre1">unknown	for	what	you	truly	are,	then	your	opportunities	and	chances	of	success</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	 enormously	 increased.	 It	 is,	 however,	 the	 exception	 when	 one	 can	 start without	the	knowledge	of	anybody	involved,	and	the	Scotland	Yard	of	the	future</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a>will	pursue	its	business	under	very	different	circumstances	from	the	present.	The detective's	 work	 should	 be	 made	 easier	 and	 not	 more	 difficult.	 None	 should know	 who	 is	 working	 on	 a	 case.	 The	 law's	 representatives	 should	 be	 disguised and	move	among	the	characters	surrounding	the	crime	as	something	other	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	really	are.	They	will—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here	Hardcastle's	reflections	came	to	an	end.	Some	previous	notes	there	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 superficial	 accidents	 in	 the	 Grey	 Room	 and	 a	 rough	 ground	 plan	 of	 it;	 but nothing	 more.	 He	 had	 evidently,	 for	 the	 time	 being,	 broken	 away	 from	 his environment	and	was	merely	thinking,	with	a	pen	on	paper,	when	he	died. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	VII.	THE	FANATIC</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 succession	 of	 incidents,	 that	 must	 have	 perturbed	 the	 doctor	 and	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">companion	 in	 earnest,	 had	 followed	 upon	 their	 departure	 from	 Chadlands,	 and Mary	soon	discovered	that	she	was	faced	with	a	terrible	problem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 one	 young	 woman	 had	 little	 chance	 of	 winning	 her	 way	 against	 an	 old man	 and	 the	 religious	 convictions	 that	 another	 had	 impressed	 upon	 him.	 Sir Walter	 and	 the	 priest	 were	 now	 at	 one,	 nor	 did	 the	 common	 sense	 of	 a	 fourth party	 to	 the	 argument	 convince	 them.	 At	 dinner	 Septimus	 May	 declared	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">purpose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	 are	 happily	 free	 of	 any	 antagonistic	 and	 material	 influence,"	 he	 said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Providence	has	willed	that	those	opposed	to	us	should	be	taken	elsewhere,	and	I am	now	able	to	do	my	duty	without	more	opposition." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Surely,	father,	you	do	not	wish	this?"	asked	Mary.	"I	thought	you—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	the	elder	was	fretful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let	 me	 eat	 my	 meal	 in	 peace,"	 he	 answered.	 "I	 am	 not	 made	 of	 iron,	 and reason	cuts	both	ways.	It	was	reasonable	to	deny	Mr.	May	before	these	events.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 be	 unreasonable	 to	 pretend	 that	 the	 death	 of	 Peter	 Hardcastle	 has	 not changed	my	opinions.	To	cleave	to	the	possibility	of	a	physical	explanation	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">longer	is	mere	folly	and	obstinacy.	I	believe	him	to	be	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This	is	fearful	for	me—and	fearful	for	everybody	here.	Don't	you	see	what	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 mean	 if	 anything	 happened	 to	 you,	 Mr.	 May?	 Even	 supposing	 there	 is	 a spirit	hidden	in	the	Grey	Room	with	power	and	permission	to	destroy	us—why, </p>
<p class="calibre1">that	being	so,	are	you	any	safer	than	dear	Tom	was	or	this	poor	man?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Because	 I	 am	 armed,	 Mary,	 and	 they	 were	 defenseless.	 Unhappily	 youth	 is seldom	 clothed	 in	 the	 whole	 armor	 of	 righteousness.	 My	 dear	 son	 was	 a	 good and	 honorable	 man,	 but	 he	 was	 not	 a	 religious	 man.	 He	 had	 yet	 to	 learn	 the incomparable	and	vital	value	of	the	practice	of	Christian	faith.	Hardcastle	invited</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 own	 doom.	 He	 admitted—he	 even	 appeared	 to	 pride	 himself	 upon	 a	 crude and	pagan	rationalism.	It	is	not	surprising	that	such	a	man	should	be	called	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	learn	the	lessons	of	which	he	stood	so	gravely	in	need." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 know	 that	 our	 dear	 Tom	 was	 bidden	 to	 higher	 work—to	 labor	 in	 a	 higher cause	 than	 here,	 to	 purer	 knowledge	 of	 those	 things	 that	 matter	 most	 to	 the human	 soul,"	 said	 Mary.	 "But	 that	 is	 not	 to	 say	 God	 chose	 to	 take	 him	 by	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>miracle.	For	what	you	believe	amounts	to	a	miracle.	You	know	that	I	am	bearing my	loss	in	the	same	spirit	as	yourself,	but,	granted	it	had	to	be	at	God's	will,	that is	no	reason	why	we	should	suppose	the	means	employed	were	outside	nature." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	 can	 you	 pretend	 they	 are	 inside	 nature,	 as	 we	 know	 it?"	 asked	 her father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	 know	 nothing	 at	 all	 yet,	 and	 I	 implore	 Mr.	 May	 to	 wait	 until	 we	 are	 at least	assured	that	science	cannot	find	a	reason." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fear	 not	 for	 me,	 my	 child,"	 answered	 Septimus	 May.	 "You	 forget	 certain details	 that	 have	 assisted	 to	 decide	 me.	 Remember	 that	 Hardcastle	 had	 openly denied	and	derided	 the	possibility	of	 supernatural	peril.	He	 had	challenged	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">potent	thing	not	an	hour	before	he	was	brought	face	to	face	with	it.	Tom	went	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	death	innocently;	this	man	cannot	be	absolved	so	easily.	In	my	case,	with	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowledge	 and	 faith,	 the	 conditions	 are	 very	 different,	 and	 I	 oppose	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">impregnable	barrier	between	myself	and	the	secret	being.	I	am	an	old	priest,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 go	 knowing	 the	 nature	 of	 my	 task.	 My	 weapons	 are	 such	 that	 a	 good	 spirit would	applaud	them	and	an	evil	spirit	be	powerless	against	them.	Do	you	not	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	the	Almighty	could	never	permit	one	of	His	creatures—for	even	the	devils</p>
<p class="calibre1">also	 are	 His—to	 defeat	 His	 own	 minister	 or	 trample	 on	 the	 name	 of	 Christ?	 It would	amount	to	that.	So	armed	one	might	walk	in	safety	through	the	lowermost</p>
<p class="calibre1">hell,	for	hell	can	only	believe	and	tremble	before	the	truth." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary	 looked	 hopelessly	 at	 her	 father;	 but	 he	 offered	 her	 small	 comfort.	 Sir Walter	still	found	himself	conforming	to	the	fierce	piety	and	dogmatic	assurance</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	man	of	God.	In	this	welter	and	upheaval	his	modest	intellect	found	only	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">foothold	here,	and	his	judgment	now	firmly	inclined	to	the	confident	assertions</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	religion.	He	was	himself	a	devout	and	conventional	believer,	and	he	turned	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 support	 of	 faith,	 and	 shared,	 with	 increasing	 conviction,	 the	 opinion	 of Septimus	 May,	 as	 uttered	 in	 a	 volume	 of	 confident	 words.	 He	 became	 blind	 to the	 physical	 danger.	 He	 even	 showed	 a	 measure	 of	 annoyance	 at	 Mary's</p>
<p class="calibre1">obstinate	entreaties.	She	strove	to	calm	him,	and	told	him	he	was	not	himself—</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	 assertion	 that,	 by	 his	 inner	 consciousness	 of	 its	 truth,	 seemed	 to	 incense	 Sir Walter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 begged	 her	 to	 be	 silent,	 and	 declared	 that	 her	 remarks	 savored	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">irreverence.	Startled	and	bewildered	by	such	a	criticism,	the	woman	was	indeed</p>
<p class="calibre1">silent	 for	 some	 time,	 while	 her	 father-in-law	 flowed	 on	 and	 uttered	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">conviction.	 Yet	 not	 all	 his	 intensity	 and	 asseverations	 could	 justify	 such extravagant	assertion.	At	another	time	they	might	even	have	amused	Mary;	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	sight	of	the	fact	that	her	father	was	yielding,	and	that	the	end	of	the	argument</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	mean	the	clergyman	in	the	Grey	Room,	she	could	win	nothing	but	frantic</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a>anxiety	from	the	situation.	Sir	Walter	was	broken;	he	had	lost	his	hold	on	reality, and	she	realized	that.	His	unsettled	intelligence	had	gone	over	to	the	opposition, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	there	was	none,	as	it	seemed,	to	argue	on	her	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Septimus	May	had	acted	like	a	dangerous	drug	on	Sir	Walter;	he	appeared	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	intoxicated	in	some	degree.	But	only	in	mind,	not	in	manner.	He	argued	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	new	attitude,	and	he	was	not	as	excited	as	the	priest,	but	maintained	his	usual</p>
<p class="calibre1">level	tones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	agreed	with	Mannering	and	Henry	yesterday,	as	you	know,	Mary,"	he	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"and	at	my	desire	Mr.	May	desisted	from	his	wish.	We	see	how	mistaken	I	was, </p>
<p class="calibre1">how	 right	 he	 must	 have	 been.	 I	 have	 thought	 it	 out	 this	 afternoon,	 calmly	 and logically.	These	unfortunate	young	men	have	died	without	a	reason,	for	be	sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	explanation	of	Peter	Hardcastle's	death	will	be	forthcoming	though	the	whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">College	of	Surgeons	examines	his	corpse.	Then	we	must	admit	that	life	has	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">snatched	 out	 of	 these	 bodies	 by	 some	 force	 of	 which	 we	 have	 no	 conception. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Were	 it	 natural,	 science	 would	 have	 discovered	 a	 reason	 for	 death;	 but	 it	 could not,	because	their	lives	flowed	away	as	water	out	of	a	bottle,	leaving	the	bottle</p>
<p class="calibre1">unchanged	in	every	particular.	But	life	does	not	desert	its	physical	habitation	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	 terms.	 It	 cannot	 quit	 a	 healthy,	 human	 body	 neither	 ruined	 nor	 rent.	 You must	 be	 honest	 with	 yourself,	 my	 child,	 as	 well	 as	 with	 your	 father-in-law	 and me.	 A	 physical	 cause	 being	 absolutely	 ruled	 out,	 what	 remains?	 To-night	 I emphatically	 support	 Mr.	 May,	 and	 my	 conscience,	 long	 in	 terrible	 concern,	 is now	 at	 rest	 again.	 And	 because	 it	 is	 at	 rest,	 I	 know	 that	 I	 have	 done	 well.	 I believe	that	what	dear	Tom's	father	desires	to	do—namely,	to	spend	this	night	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 Grey	 Room—is	 now	 within	 his	 province	 and	 entirely	 proper	 to	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">profession,	and	I	share	his	perfect	faith	and	confidence." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	 is	 you	 who	 lack	 faith,	 Mary,"	 continued	 Septimus	 May.	 "You	 lack	 faith, otherwise	 you	 would	 appreciate	 the	 unquestionable	 truth	 of	 what	 your	 father tells	you.	Listen,"	he	continued,	"and	understand	something	of	what	this	means from	a	larger	outlook	than	our	own	selfish	and	immediate	interests.	Much	may</p>
<p class="calibre1">come	 of	 my	 action	 for	 the	 Faith	 at	 large.	 I	 may	 find	 an	 answer	 to	 those	 grave questions	concerning	the	life	beyond	and	the	whole	problem	of	spiritualism	now</p>
<p class="calibre1">convulsing	the	Church	and	casting	us	into	opposing	sections.	It	is	untrodden	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">mysterious	 ground;	 but	 I	 am	 called	 upon	 to	 tread	 it.	 For	 my	 part,	 I	 am	 never prepared	to	flout	inquirers	if	they	approach	these	subjects	in	a	reverent	spirit.	We must	 not	 revile	 good	 men	 because	 they	 think	 differently	 from	 ourselves.	 We must	examine	the	assertions	of	such	inquirers	as	Sir	Oliver	Lodge	and	Sir	Conan</p>
<p class="calibre1">Doyle	 in	 a	 mood	 of	 reverence	 and	 sympathy.	 Some	 men	 drift	 away	 from	 the truth	in	vital	particulars;	but	not	so	far	that	they	cannot	return	if	the	road	is	made</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a>clear	to	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	 must	 remember	 that	 our	 conviction	 of	 a	 double	 existence	 rests	 on	 the revelation	of	God	through	His	Son,	not	on	a	mere,	vague	desire	toward	a	future</p>
<p class="calibre1">life	common	to	all	sorts	and	conditions	of	men.	They	suspected	and	hoped;	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">know.	Science	may	explain	that	general	desire	if	it	pleases;	it	cannot	explain,	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">destroy,	the	triumphant	certainty	born	of	faith.	Spiritualism	has	succeeded	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">biblical	record	of	'possession,'	and	I,	for	my	part,	of	course	prefer	what	my	Bible</p>
<p class="calibre1">teaches.	 I	 do	 not	 myself	 find	 that	 the	 'mediums'	 of	 modern	 spiritualism	 speak with	 tongues	 worthy	 of	 much	 respect	 up	 to	 the	 present,	 and	 it	 is	 certain	 that rogues	 abound;	 but	 the	 question	 is	 clamant.	 It	 demands	 to	 be	 discussed	 by	 our spiritual	 guides	 and	 the	 fathers	 of	 the	 Church.	 Already	 they	 recognize	 this	 fact and	are	beginning	to	approach	it—some	priests	in	a	right	spirit,	some—as	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Church	Congress	last	month—in	a	wrong	spirit." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	wrong	spirit,	May?"	asked	Sir	Walter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In	my	opinion,	a	wrong	spirit,"	answered	the	other.	"There	is	much,	even	in	a meeting	 of	 the	 Church	 Congress,	 that	 makes	 truly	 religious	 men	 mourn.	 They laughed	when	they	should	have	learned.	I	refer	to	incidents	and	criticisms	of	last</p>
<p class="calibre1">October.	 There	 the	 Dean	 of	 Manchester,	 who	 shows	 how	 those,	 who	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">apparently	 spoken	 to	 us	 from	 Beyond	 through	 the	 mouths	 of	 living	 persons, describe	their	different	states	and	conditions.	Stainton	Moses	gave	us	a	vision	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">heaven	such	as	an	Oxford	don	and	myself	might	be	supposed	to	appreciate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Raymond	 describes	 a	 heaven	 wherein	 the	 average	 second	 lieutenant	 could find	 all	 that,	 for	 the	 moment,	 he	 needs.	 But	 why	 laugh	 at	 these	 things?	 If	 we make	our	own	hells,	shall	we	not	make	our	own	heavens?	We	must	go	into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">next	 world	 more	 or	 less	 cloyed	 and	 clogged	 with	 the	 emotions	 and	 interests	 of this	 one.	 It	 is	 inevitable.	 We	 cannot	 instantly	 throw	 off	 a	 lifetime	 of	 interests, affections,	and	desires.	We	are	still	human	and	pass	onward	as	human	beings,	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	angels	of	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Therefore,	 we	 may	 reasonably	 suppose	 that	 the	 Almighty	 will	 temper	 the wind	to	the	shorn	lamb,	nor	impose	too	harsh	and	terrible	a	transformation	upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	souls	of	the	righteous	departed,	but	lead	one	and	all,	by	gradual	stages	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	 not	 unfamiliar	 conditions,	 to	 the	 heaven	 of	 ultimate	 and	 absolute</p>
<p class="calibre1">perfection	that	He	has	designed	for	His	conscious	creatures." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well	spoken,"	said	Sir	Walter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Mr.	May	had	not	finished.	He	proceeded	to	the	immediate	point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shall	 it	 be	 denied	 that	 devils	 have	 been	 cast	 out	 in	 the	 name	 of	 God?"	 he asked.	"And	if	from	human	tenements,	then	why	not	from	dwellings	made	with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a>human	hands	also?	May	not	a	house	be	similarly	cleansed	as	well	as	a	soul?	This unknown	 spirit—angel	 or	 fiend,	 or	 other	 sentient	 being—is	 permitted	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">challenge	mankind	and	draw	attention	to	its	existence.	A	mystery,	I	grant,	but	its</p>
<p class="calibre1">Maker	has	now	willed	that	some	measure	of	this	mystery	shall	be	revealed	to	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	are	called	to	play	our	part	in	this	spirit's	existence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	 would	 seem	 that	 it	 has	 endured	 a	 sort	 of	 imprisonment	 in	 this	 particular room	 for	 more	 years	 than	 we	 know,	 and	 it	 may	 actually	 be	 the	 spirit	 of	 some departed	 human	 being	 condemned,	 for	 causes	 that	 humanity	 has	 forgotten,	 to remain	 within	 these	 walls.	 The	 nameless	 and	 unknown	 thing	 cries	 passionately to	be	liberated,	and	is	permitted	by	its	Maker	to	draw	our	terrified	attention	upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">itself	by	the	exercise	of	destructive	functions	transcending	our	reason. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"God,	then,	has	willed	that,	through	the	agency	of	devout	and	living	men,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">unhappy	phantom	shall	now	be	translated	and	moved	from	this	environment	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever;	and	to	me	the	appointed	task	is	allotted.	So	I	believe,	as	firmly	as	I	believe in	the	death	and	resurrection	of	the	Lord.	Is	that	clear	to	you,	Sir	Walter?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	is.	You	have	made	it	convincingly	clear." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	 be	 it,	 then.	 I,	 too,	 Mary,	 am	 not	 dead	 to	 the	 meaning	 of	 science	 in	 its proper	 place.	 We	 may	 take	 an	 illustration	 of	 what	 I	 have	 told	 you	 from</p>
<p class="calibre1">astronomy.	 As	 comets	 enter	 our	 system	 from	 realms	 of	 which	 we	 have	 no</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowledge,	dazzle	us	a	little,	awaken	our	speculations	and	then	depart,	so	may</p>
<p class="calibre1">certain	 immortal	 spirits	 also	 be	 supposed	 to	 act.	 We	 entangle	 them	 possibly	 in our	 gross	 air	 and	 detain	 them	 for	 centuries,	 or	 moments,	 until	 their	 Creator's purpose	 in	 sending	 them	 is	 accomplished.	 Then	 He	 takes	 the	 means	 to	 liberate them	and	set	them	on	their	eternal	roads	and	to	their	eternal	tasks	once	more." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 listening	 woman,	 almost	 against	 her	 reason,	 felt	 herself	 beginning	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">share	these	assumptions.	But	that	they	were	fantastic,	unsupported	by	any	human</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowledge,	and	would	presently	involve	an	experiment	full	of	awful	peril	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">life	of	the	man	who	uttered	them,	she	also	perceived.	Yet	her	reasonable	caution</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 conventional	 distrust	 began	 to	 give	 way	 a	 little	 under	 the	 priest's	 magnetic voice,	his	flaming	eyes,	his	positive	and	triumphant	certainty	of	truth.	He	burned</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 his	 inspiration,	 and	 she	 felt	 herself	 powerless	 to	 oppose	 any	 argument founded	 on	 facts	 against	 the	 mystic	 enthusiasm	 of	 such	 religious	 faith.	 His honesty	 and	 fervor	 could	 not,	 however,	 abate	 Mary's	 acute	 fear.	 Her	 father	 had entirely	gone	over	to	the	side	of	the	devotee	and	she	knew	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	 is	 well	 we	 have	 your	 opportunity	 to-night,"	 he	 said,	 "for	 had	 the	 police arrived,	out	of	their	ignorance	they	might	deny	it	to	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet	Mary	fought	on	against	them.	In	despair	she	appealed	to	Masters.	He	had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a>been	 an	 officer's	 orderly	 in	 his	 day,	 and	 when	 he	 left	 the	 Army	 and	 came	 to Chadlands,	he	never	departed	again.	He	was	an	intelligent	man,	who	occupied	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">good	 part	 of	 his	 leisure	 in	 reading.	 He	 set	 Sir	 Walter	 and	 Mary	 first	 in	 his affections;	and	that	Mary	should	have	won	him	so	completely	she	always	held	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	a	triumph,	since	Abraham	Masters	had	no	regard	or	admiration	for	women. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can't	you	help	me,	Masters?"	she	begged.	"I'm	sure	you	know	as	well	as	I	do that	this	ought	not	to	happen." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	butler	eyed	his	master.	He	was	handing	coffee,	but	none	took	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"By	all	means	speak,"	said	Sir	Walter.	"You	know	how	I	rate	your	judgment, Masters.	 You	 have	 heard	 Mr.	 May	 upon	 this	 terrible	 subject,	 and	 should	 be convinced,	as	I	am." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Masters	was	very	guarded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	not	for	me	to	pass	an	opinion,	Sir	Walter.	But	the	reverend	gentleman,	no doubt,	 understands	 such	 things.	 Only	 there's	 the	 Witch	 of	 Endor,	 if	 I	 may mention	 the	 creature,	 she	 fetched	 up	 more	 than	 she	 bargained	 for.	 And	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">remember	 a	 proverb	 as	 I	 heard	 in	 India,	 from	 a	 Hindoo.	 I've	 forgot	 the	 lingo now,	but	I	remember	the	sense.	They	Hindoos	say	that	if	you	knock	long	enough</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	a	closed	door,	the	devil	will	open	it—excuse	my	mentioning	such	a	thing;	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hindoos	are	awful	wise." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	what	then,	Masters?	I	know	not	who	may	open	the	door	of	this	mystery; </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 this	 I	 know,	 that,	 in	 the	 Name	 of	 the	 Most	 High	 God,	 I	 can	 face	 whatever opens	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 ain't	 particular	 frightened	 neither,	 your	 reverence,"	 said	 Masters.	 "But	 I wouldn't	chance	it	alone,	being	about	average	sinful	and	not	near	good	enough	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">tackle	that	unknown	horror	hid	up	there	single-handed.	I'd	chance	it,	though,	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">high	company	like	yours.	And	that's	something." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	is,	Masters,	and	much	to	your	credit,"	declared	Sir	Walter.	"For	that	matter, I	would	do	the	like.	Indeed,	I	am	willing	to	accompany	Mr.	May." </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	 Septimus	 May	 shook	 his	 head	 and	 Mary	 trembled,	 the	 butler	 spoke</p>
<p class="calibre1">again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	 there's	 nobody	 else	 in	 this	 house	 would.	 Not	 even	 Fred	 Caunter,	 who doesn't	know	the	meaning	of	fear,	as	you	can	testify,	Sir	Walter.	But	he's	fed	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	Grey	Room,	if	I	may	say	so,	and	so's	the	housekeeper,	Mrs.	Forbes,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">so's	 Jane	 Bond.	 Not	 that	 they	 would	 desert	 the	 ship;	 but	 there's	 others	 that	 be going	to	do	so.	I	may	mention	that	four	maids	and	Jackson	intend	to	give	notice</p>
<p class="calibre1">to-morrow.	 Ann	 Maine,	 the	 second	 housemaid,	 has	 gone	 to-night.	 Her	 father</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a>fetched	 her.	 Excuse	 me	 mentioning	 it,	 but	 Mrs.	 Forbes	 will	 give	 you	 the particulars	to-morrow,	if	you	please." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hysteria,"	declared	Sir	Walter.	"I	don't	blame	them.	It	is	natural.	Everybody is	free	to	go,	if	they	desire	to	do	so.	But	tell	them	what	you	have	heard	to-night, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Masters.	Tell	them	that	no	good	Christian	need	fear	to	rest	in	peace.	Explain	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	May	will	presently	enter	the	Grey	Room	in	the	name	of	God;	and	bid	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">pray	on	their	knees	for	him	before	they	go	to	sleep." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Masters	hesitated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	the	same,	I	very	much	wish	the	reverend	gentleman	would	give	Scotland</p>
<p class="calibre1">Yard	 a	 chance.	 If	 they	 fall,	 then	 he	 can	 wipe	 their	 eye	 after—excuse	 my language,	Sir	Walter.	I've	read	a	lot	about	the	spirits,	being	terrible	interested	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">'em,	 as	 all	 human	 men	 must	 be;	 and	 I	 hear	 that	 running	 after	 'em	 often	 brings trouble.	I	don't	mean	to	your	life,	Sir	Walter,	but	to	your	wits.	People	get	cracked on	 'em	 and	 have	 to	 be	 locked	 up.	 I	 stopped	 everybody	 frightening	 themselves into	'sterics	at	dinner	to-day;	but	you	could	see	how	it	took	'em;	and,	whether	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">no,	I	do	beg	Mr.	May	to	be	so	kind	as	to	let	me	sit	up	along	with	him	to-night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	never	hear	of	two	people	getting	into	trouble	with	these	here	customers, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 while	 he	 was	 going	 for	 this	 blackguard	 ghost	 in	 the	 name	 of	 the	 Lord,	 I could	 keep	 my	 weather	 eye	 lifting	 for	 trouble.	 'Tis	 a	 matter	 for	 common	 sense and	keeping	your	nerve,	in	my	opinion,	and	we	don't	want	another	death	on	our</p>

<p class="calibre1">famous	detective	has	been	done	in?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Henry	 deplored	 the	 same	 thing,"	 said	 Mary.	 "And	 I	 answer	 again,	 as	 I answered	 then,"	 replied	 Septimus	 May.	 "You	 mean	 well,	 Sir	 Walter,	 and	 your butler	 means	 well;	 but	 you	 propose	 an	 act	 in	 direct	 opposition	 to	 the	 principle that	inspires	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	do	you	expect	to	happen?"	asked	Mary.	"Do	you	suppose	you	will	see something,	 and	 that	 something	 will	 tell	 you	 what	 it	 is,	 and	 why	 it	 killed	 dear Tom?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That,	at	any	rate,	would	be	a	very	great	blessing	to	the	living,"	said	her	father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	least	the	creature	could	do,	in	my	humble	opinion,"	ventured	Masters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Septimus	May	deprecated	such	curiosity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hope	for	no	such	thing,	and	do	not	dwell	upon	what	is	to	happen	until	I	am</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>able	to	tell	you	what	does	happen,"	he	answered.	"Allow	no	human	weakness,	no desire	to	learn	the	secrets	of	another	world,	to	distract	your	thoughts.	I	am	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">concerned	 with	 what	 I	 know	 beyond	 possibility	 of	 doubt	 is	 my	 duty—to	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">entered	upon	as	swiftly	as	possible.	I	hear	my	call	in	the	very	voice	of	the	wind</p>
<p class="calibre1">shouting	round	the	house	to-night.	But	beyond	my	duty	I	do	not	seek.	Whether</p>
<p class="calibre1">information	 awaits	 me,	 whether	 some	 manifestation	 indicating	 my	 success	 and valuable	 to	 humanity	 will	 be	 granted,	 I	 cannot	 say.	 I	 do	 not	 stop	 now	 to	 think about	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Alone	 I	 do	 this	 thing—yet	 not	 alone,	 for	 my	 hand	 is	 in	 my	 Maker's	 hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your	part	will	not	be	to	accompany	me.	Let	each	man	and	woman	be	informed</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	what	I	do,	and	let	them	lift	a	petition	for	me,	that	my	work	be	crowned	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">success.	But	let	them	not	assume	that	to-morrow	I	shall	have	anything	to	impart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	night	may	be	one	of	peace	within,	though	so	stormy	without.	I	may	pray	till</p>
<p class="calibre1">dawn	with	no	knowledge	how	my	prayer	prospers,	or	I	may	be	called	to	face	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	that	no	human	eye	has	ever	seen	and	lived.	These	things	are	hidden	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">us." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	 are	 wonderful,	 and	 it	 is	 heartening	 to	 meet	 with	 such	 mighty	 faith," </p>
<p class="calibre1">replied	 Sir	 Walter.	 "You	 have	 no	 fear,	 no	 shadow	 of	 hesitation	 or	 doubt	 at	 the bottom	of	your	mind?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"None.	 Only	 an	 overmastering	 desire	 to	 obey	 the	 message	 that	 throbs	 in	 my heart.	I	will	be	honest	with	you,	for	I	recognize	that	many	might	doubt	whether</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	 were	 in	 the	 right	 to	 let	 me	 face	 this	 ordeal.	 But	 I	 am	 driven	 by	 an overwhelming	mandate.	Did	I	fear,	or	feel	one	tremor	of	uncertainty,	I	would	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">proceed;	for	any	wavering	might	be	fatal	and	give	me	helpless	into	the	power	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	watchful	spirit;	but	I	am	as	certain	of	my	duty	as	I	am	that	salvation	awaits</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	just	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 believe	 that	 I	 shall	 liberate	 this	 arrested	 being	 with	 cathartic	 prayer	 and cleansing	petition	to	our	common	Maker.	And	have	I	not	the	spirit	of	my	dead</p>
<p class="calibre1">boy	 on	 my	 side?	 Could	 any	 living	 man,	 however	 well	 intentioned,	 watch	 with me	and	over	me	as	he	will?	Fear	nothing;	go	to	your	rest,	and	let	all	who	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">assist	me	do	so	on	their	knees	before	they	sleep." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	Masters	echoed	some	of	this	fierce	and	absolute	faith	when	he	returned</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	servants'	hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"His	eyes	blaze,"	he	said.	"He's	about	the	most	steadfast	man	ever	I	saw	inside a	pulpit,	or	out	of	it.	You	feel	if	that	man	went	to	the	window	and	told	the	rain	to stop	and	the	wind	to	go	down,	they	would.	No	ghost	that	ever	walked	could	best</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	anyway.	They	asked	me	to	talk	and	say	what	I	felt,	and	I	did;	but	words	are</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>powerless	against	such	an	iron	will	as	he's	got. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 doubted	 first,	 and	 Sir	 Walter	 said	 he	 doubted	 likewise;	 but	 he's	 dead	 sure now,	and	what's	good	enough	for	him	is	good	enough	for	us.	I'll	bet	Caunter,	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	man,	an	even	flyer	that	he's	going	to	put	the	creature	down	and	out	and	come</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	without	a	scratch	himself.	I	offered	to	sit	up	with	him,	so	did	Sir	Walter;	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 wouldn't	 hear	 of	 it.	 So	 all	 we've	 got	 to	 do	 is	 to	 turn	 in	 and	 say	 our	 prayers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's	simple	enough	for	God-fearing	people,	and	we	can't	do	no	better	than	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">obey	orders." </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	none	the	less	a	nervous	and	highly	strung	household	that	presently	went</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 bed,	 and	 no	 woman	 slept	 without	 another	 woman	 to	 keep	 her	 company.	 Sir Walter	 found	 himself	 worn	 out	 in	 mind	 and	 body.	 Mary	 made	 him	 take	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">bromide,	and	he	slept	without	a	dream,	despite	the	din	of	the	great	"sou'-wester" </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	the	distant,	solemn	crash	of	more	than	one	great	tree	thrown	upon	the	lap	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother	earth	at	last. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	 he	 retired,	 however,	 something	 in	 the	 nature	 of	 a	 procession	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">escorted	the	priest	to	his	ordeal.	Mr.	May	donned	biretta,	surplice,	and	stole,	for, as	 he	 explained,	 he	 was	 to	 hold	 a	 religious	 service	 as	 sacred	 and	 significant	 as any	other	rite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lord	send	him	no	congregation	then,"	thought	Masters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But,	with	Sir	Walter	and	Mary,	he	followed	the	ministrant,	and	left	him	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">open	 door	 of	 the	 Grey	 Room.	 The	 electric	 light	 shone	 steadily;	 but	 the	 storm seemed	 to	 beat	 its	 fists	 at	 the	 windows,	 and	 the	 leaded	 panes	 shook	 and chattered.	 With	 no	 bell	 and	 candle,	 but	 his	 Bible	 alone,	 Septimus	 May	 entered the	room,	having	first	made	the	sign	of	the	Cross	before	him;	then	he	turned	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">bade	good-night	to	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Be	of	good	faith!"	were	the	last	words	he	spoke	to	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having	 done	 so	 he	 shut	 the	 door,	 and	 they	 heard	 his	 voice	 immediately</p>
<p class="calibre1">uplifted	 in	 prayer.	 They	 waited	 a	 little,	 and	 the	 sound	 roiled	 steadily	 on.	 Sir Walter	then	bade	Masters	extinguish	all	the	lights	and	send	the	household	to	bed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">though	the	time	was	not	more	than	ten	o'clock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 for	 Masters,	 the	 glamour	 and	 appeal	 of	 those	 strenuous	 words	 at	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dinner-table	 had	 now	 passed,	 and	 presently,	 as	 he	 prepared	 to	 retire,	 he	 found himself	 far	 less	 confident	 and	 assured	 than	 his	 recent	 words	 had	 implied.	 He sank	slowly	from	hope	to	fear,	even	pictured	the	worse,	and	asked	himself	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 follow	 if	 the	 worst	 happened.	 He	 believed	 that	 it	 might	 mean	 serious disaster	for	Sir	Walter.	If	another	life	were	sacrificed	to	this	unknown	peril,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	transpired	that	his	master	had	sanctioned	what	would	amount	to	suicide	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a>eyes	of	reason;	then	he	began	to	fear	that	grave	trouble	must	result.	Already	the burning	 words	 of	 Septimus	 May	 began	 to	 cool	 and	 sound	 unreal,	 and	 Masters suspected	that,	if	they	were	repeated	in	other	ears,	which	had	not	heard	him	utter</p>
<p class="calibre1">them,	or	seen	the	fervor	of	religious	earnestness	and	reverence	in	which	they	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	spoken,	this	feverish	business	of	exorcising	a	ghost	in	the	twentieth	century</p>
<p class="calibre1">might	 only	 awake	 derision	 and	 receive	 neither	 credence	 nor	 respect.	 His	 entire concern	 was	 for	 Sir	 Walter,	 not	 Mr.	 May.	 He	 could	 not	 sleep,	 lighted	 a	 pipe, considered	whether	it	was	in	his	power	to	do	anything,	felt	a	sudden	impulse	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">take	 certain	 steps,	 yet	 hesitated—from	 no	 fear	 to	 himself,	 but	 doubt	 whether action	 might	 not	 endanger	 another.	 Mary	 did	 not	 sleep	 either,	 and	 she	 suffered more,	for	she	had	never	approved,	and	now	she	blamed	herself	not	a	little	for	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">weak	 opposition.	 A	 thousand	 arguments	 occurred	 to	 her	 while	 she	 lay	 awake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	for	a	time,	she	forgot	present	tribulations,	and	her	own	grief	overwhelmed</p>
<p class="calibre1">her,	 as	 it	 was	 wont	 to	 do	 by	 night.	 For	 while	 the	 events	 that	 had	 so	 swiftly followed	each	other	since	her	husband's	death	banished	him	now	and	again,	save</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	her	subconscious	mind,	when	alone	he	was	swift	to	return	and	her	sorrow</p>
<p class="calibre1">made	 many	 a	 night	 sleepless.	 She	 was	 herself	 ill,	 but	 did	 not	 know	 it.	 The reaction	had	yet	to	come,	and	could	not	be	long	delayed,	for	her	nervous	energy</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 worn	 out	 now.	 She	 wept	 and	 lived	 days	 with	 the	 dead;	 then	 the	 present returned	 to	 her	 mind,	 and	 she	 fretted	 and	 prayed—for	 Septimus	 May	 and	 for daylight.	She	wondered	why	stormy	nights	were	always	the	longest.	She	heard	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">thousand	 unfamiliar	 sounds,	 and	 presently	 leaped	 from	 her	 bed,	 put	 on	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">dressing-gown,	and	crept	out	into	the	house.	To	know	that	all	was	well	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">watcher	 would	 hearten	 her.	 But	 then	 her	 feet	 dragged	 before	 she	 had	 left	 the threshold	of	her	own	room,	and	she	stood	still	and	shuddered	a	little.	For	how	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	were	not	well?	How	if	his	voice	no	longer	sounded? </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	hesitated	to	make	the	experiment,	and	balanced	the	relief	of	reassurance</p>
<p class="calibre1">against	 the	 horror	 of	 silence.	 She	 remembered	 a	 storm	 at	 sea,	 when	 through	 a long	night,	not	lacking	danger	to	a	laboring	steamer	with	weak	engines,	she	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">lain	awake	and	felt	her	heart	warm	again	when	the	watch	shouted	the	hour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	set	out,	then,	determined	to	know	if	all	prospered	with	her	father-in-law. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nor	 would	 she	 give	 ear	 to	 misgiving	 or	 ask	 herself	 what	 she	 would	 do	 if	 no voice	were	steadily	uplifted	in	the	Grey	Room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 great	 wind	 seemed	 to	 play	 upon	 Chadlands	 like	 a	 harp.	 It	 roared	 and reverberated,	now	stilled	a	moment	for	another	leap,	now	died	away	against	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">house,	 yet	 still	 sounded	 with	 a	 steady	 shout	 in	 the	 neighbor	 trees.	 At	 the casements	it	tugged	and	rattled;	against	them	it	flung	the	rain	fiercely.	Every	bay</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	passage	of	the	interior	uttered	its	own	voice,	and	overhead	was	creaking	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a>old	timbers,	rattling	of	old	slates,	and	rustling	of	mortar	fragments	dislodged	by sudden	vibrations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary	 proceeded	 on	 her	 way,	 and	 then,	 to	 her	 astonishment,	 heard	 a	 footfall, and	 nearly	 ran	 into	 an	 invisible	 figure	 approaching	 from	 the	 direction	 of	 the Grey	 Room.	 Man	 and	 woman	 startled	 each	 other,	 but	 neither	 exclaimed,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	May	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who	is	it?"	she	asked;	and	Masters	answered:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	my	gracious!	Terrible	sorry,	ma'am!	If	I	didn't	think—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	on	earth	are	you	doing,	Masters?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Much	the	same	as	you,	I	expect,	ma'am.	I	thought	just	to	creep	along	and	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	the	reverend	gentleman	was	all	right.	And	he	is.	The	light's	burning—you	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	 it	 under	 the	 door—and	 he's	 praying	 away,	 steady	 as	 a	 steam-threshing</p>
<p class="calibre1">machine.	I	doubt	he's	keeping	the	evil	creature	at	arm's	length,	and	I'm	a	tidy	lot</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	 hopeful	 than	 what	 I	 was	 an	 hour	 ago.	 The	 thing	 ain't	 strong	 enough	 to touch	 a	 man	 praying	 to	 God	 like	 what	 he	 can.	 But	 if	 prayers	 keep	 it	 harmless, then	it's	got	ears	and	it's	alive!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can	you	believe	that,	Masters?"	she	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Got	 to,	 ma'am.	 If	 it	 was	 just	 a	 natural	 horror	 beyond	 the	 reach	 of	 prayer,	 it would	 have	 knocked	 his	 reverence	 out	 long	 before	 now,	 like	 other	 people.	 It settled	the	police	officer	in	under	an	hour,	and	Mr.	May's	been	up	against	it	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">three—nearly	four	hours,	so	far.	He'll	bolt	it	yet,	I	shouldn't	wonder,	like	a	ferret bolts	a	rat." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	really	feel	more	hopeful?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	 I	 do,	 ma'am;	 and	 if	 he	 can	 fire	 the	 creature	 and	 signal	 'All's	 clear'	 for Chadlands,	it	will	calm	everybody	and	be	a	proper	feather	in	his	cap,	and	he	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">ought	to	be	made	a	bishop,	at	the	least.	Not	that	Scotland	Yard	men	will	believe</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 word	 of	 it	 to-morrow,	 all	 the	 same.	 Ghosts	 are	 bang	 out	 of	 their	 line,	 and	 I never	 met	 even	 a	 common	 constable	 that	 believed	 in	 'em,	 except	 Bob	 Parrett, and	he	had	bats	in	the	belfry,	poor	chap.	No;	they'll	reckon	it's	somebody	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">house,	 I	 expect,	 who	 wanted	 to	 kill	 t'	 others,	 but	 ain't	 got	 no	 quarrel	 with	 Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">May.	And	you'd	be	wise	to	get	back	to	bed,	ma'am,	and	try	to	sleep,	else	you'll</p>
<p class="calibre1">catch	a	cold.	I'll	look	round	again	in	an	hour	or	to,	if	I	don't	go	to	sleep	my	self." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 parted,	 while	 the	 storm	 still	 ran	 high,	 and	 through	 the	 empty	 corridor, when	it	was	lulled,	a	voice	rolled	steadily	on	from	the	Grey	Boom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	it	suddenly	ceased,	an	hour	before	dawn,	the	storm	had	already	begun</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 sink,	 and	 through	 a	 rack	 of	 flying	 and	 breaking	 cloud	 the	 "Hunter"	 wheeled</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a>westerly	to	his	setting. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	VIII.	THE	LABORS	OF	THE	FOUR</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	the	storm,	Sir	Walter	slept	through	the	night,	and	did	not	waken	until</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	man	drew	the	blinds	upon	a	dawn	sky	so	clear	that	it	seemed	washed	of	its</p>
<p class="calibre1">blue.	He	had	directed	to	be	wakened	at	six	o'clock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	of	Mr.	May?"	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Masters	wants	to	know	if	we	shall	call	him,	Sir	Walter." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	 if	 he	 has	 returned	 to	 his	 room,	 but	 immediately	 if	 still	 in	 the	 Grey Room." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	not	in	his	own	room,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	seek	him	at	once." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	valet	hesitated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Please,	Sir	Walter,	there's	none	much	cares	to	open	the	door." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	heard	his	daughter's	voice	outside	at	the	same	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mr.	May	has	not	left	the	Grey	Room,	father." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	be	with	you	in	a	moment,"	he	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he	rose,	dressed	partially,	and	joined	her.	She	was	full	of	active	fear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	 went	 well	 at	 two	 o'clock,"	 she	 said,	 "for	 I	 crept	 out	 to	 listen.	 So	 did Masters.	Mr.	May's	voice	sounded	clear	and	steady." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 found	 the	 butler	 at	 the	 door	 of	 the	 Grey	 Room.	 He	 was	 pale	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">mopping	his	forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've	called	to	him,	but	it's	as	silent	as	the	grave	in	there,"	he	said.	"It's	all	up with	the	gentleman;	I	know	it!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	may	not	be	there;	he	may	have	gone	out,"	answered	Sir	Walter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he	opened	the	door	widely	and	entered.	The	electric	light	still	shone	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">killed	 the	 pallid	 white	 stare	 of	 the	 morning.	 Upon	 a	 little	 table	 under	 it	 they observed	 Septimus	 May's	 Bible,	 open	 at	 an	 epistle	 of	 St.	 Paul,	 but	 the	 priest himself	was	on	the	floor	some	little	distance	away.	He	lay	in	a	huddled	heap	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 vestments.	 He	 had	 fallen	 upon	 his	 right	 side	 apparently,	 and,	 though	 the surplice	and	cassock	which	he	had	worn	were	disarranged,	he	appeared	peaceful</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough,	with	his	cheek	on	a	foot	stool,	as	though	disposed	deliberately	upon	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ground	to	sleep.	His	biretta	was	still	upon	his	head;	his	eyes	were	open,	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a>fret	 and	 passion	 manifested	 by	 his	 face	 in	 life	 had	 entirely	 left	 it.	 He	 looked many	years	younger,	and	no	emotion	of	any	kind	marked	his	placid	countenance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	he	was	dead;	his	heart	had	ceased	to	beat	and	his	extremities	were	already</p>
<p class="calibre1">cold.	 The	 room	 appeared	 unchanged	 in	 every	 particular.	 As	 in	 the	 previous cases,	death	had	come	by	stealth,	yet	robbed,	as	far	as	the	living	could	judge,	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	terror	for	its	victim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Masters	called	Caunter	and	Sir	Walter's	valet,	who	stood	at	the	door.	The	latter</p>
<p class="calibre1">declined	 to	 enter	 or	 touch	 the	 dead,	 but	 Caunter	 obeyed,	 and	 together	 the	 two men	lifted	Mr.	May	and	carried	him	to	his	own	room.	In	a	moment	it	seemed	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	house	knew	what	had	happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	scene	of	panic	and	hysteria	followed	below	stairs,	and,	without	Jane	Bond's</p>
<p class="calibre1">description	of	it,	Mary	knew	the	people	were	running	out	of	the	house	as	from	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">plague.	 She	 left	 her	 father	 with	 Masters,	 and	 strove	 to	 calm	 the	 frightened domestics.	She	spoke	well,	and	explained	that	the	event,	horrible	though	it	was, </p>
<p class="calibre1">yet	proved	that	no	cause	for	their	alarm	any	longer	existed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	 it	 had	 been	 a	 wicked	 spirit	 we	 do	 not	 understand,	 it	 would	 have	 had	 no power	over	Mr.	May,	who	was	a	saint	of	God,"	she	said.	"Be	at	peace,	restrain yourselves,	and	fear	nothing	now.	There	is	no	ghost	here.	Had	it	been	a	demon	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	such	thing,	it	must	have	been	conscious,	and	therefore	powerless	against	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">May.	This	proves	that	there	is	some	fearful	natural	danger	which	we	have	not	yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">discovered	 hidden	 in	 the	 room,	 but	 no	 harm	 can	 happen	 to	 anybody	 if	 they	 do not	go	into	the	room.	The	police	are	coming	from	Scotland	Yard	in	an	hour	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">two,	and	you	may	feel	as	sure,	as	I	do,	and	Sir	Walter	does,	that	they	will	find</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	the	truth,	whatever	it	is.	You	must	none	of	you	think	of	leaving	before	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">come.	If	you	do,	they	will	only	send	for	you	again.	Please	prepare	your	breakfast</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	be	reasonable.	Sir	Walter	is	terribly	upset,	and	it	would	be	a	base	thing	if	any of	you	were	to	desert	him	at	a	moment	like	this." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 grew	 steadier	 before	 her,	 and	 Mrs.	 Forbes,	 the	 housekeeper,	 who</p>
<p class="calibre1">believed	what	Mary	had	said,	added	her	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	Sir	Walter's	daughter	returned	to	her	father,	who	was	with	Masters	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">study.	 A	 man	 had	 already	 started	 for	 a	 doctor,	 but	 with	 Mannering	 away	 there was	none	nearer	than	Neon	Abbot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary	called	on	Masters	to	assert	his	authority,	and	reassure	the	household	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	had	done.	She	told	him	her	argument,	and	he	accepted	it	as	a	revelation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank	God	you	could	keep	your	senses	and	see	that,	ma'am!	Tell	the	master</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 same,	 and	 make	 him	 drink	 a	 drop	 of	 spirits	 and	 get	 into	 his	 clothes.	 He's shook	cruel!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a>He	 had	 already	 brought	 the	 brandy,	 which	 was	 his	 panacea	 for	 all	 ills,	 and now	left	Mary	and	her	father	together.	She	found	him	collapsed,	and	forgot	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cause	 for	 a	 few	 moments	 in	 her	 present	 concern	 for	 him.	 Indeed,	 she	 always thought,	 and	 often	 said	 afterwards,	 that	 but	 for	 the	 minor	 needs	 for	 action	 that intervened	 in	 this	 series	 of	 terrible	 moments	 she	 must	 herself	 have	 gone	 out	 of her	 mind.	 But	 something	 always	 happened,	 as	 in	 this	 case,	 to	 demand	 her	 full attention,	and	so	arrest	and	deflect	the	strain	almost	at	the	moment	of	its	impact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 found	 that	 the	 ideas	 she	 had	 just	 employed	 to	 pacify	 the	 servants'	 hall were	also	in	her	father's	thoughts.	From	them,	however,	he	won	no	consolation, </p>
<p class="calibre1">though	he	stood	convinced.	But	the	fact	that	Septimus	May	should	have	failed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 paid	 for	 his	 failure	 with	 his	 life,	 now	 assumed	 its	 true	 significance	 for	 Sir Walter.	He	was	self-absorbed,	prostrate,	and	desperate.	In	such	a	condition	one	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 master	 of	 oneself,	 and	 may	 say	 and	 do	 anything.	 The	 old	 man's	 armor	 was off,	and	in	the	course	of	his	next	few	speeches,	by	a	selfish	forgetfulness	that	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 have	 been	 the	 first	 to	 condemn	 in	 another,	 he	 revealed	 a	 thing	 that	 was destined	 to	 cause	 the	 young	 widow	 bitter	 and	 needless	 pain.	 First,	 however,	 he pointed	out	what	she	already	grasped	and	made	clear	to	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This	 upsets	 all	 May's	 theories	 and	 gives	 the	 lie	 to	 me	 as	 well.	 Why	 did	 I believe	him!	Why	did	I	let	him	convince	me	against	my	better	judgment?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	not	fret	about	that	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	 might	 say,	 'I	 told	 you	 so!'	 but	 you	 will	 not	 do	 that.	 Nevertheless,	 you were	 right	 to	 seek	 to	 stop	 this	 unfortunate	 man	 last	 night,	 and	 he	 was	 terribly mistaken.	No	being	from	another	world	had	anything	to	do	with	his	death.	If	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">granted	that,	there	is	an	end	of	religious	faith." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	can	be	sure	of	it,	father.	Evil	spirits	would	have	had	no	power	over	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">May,	if	there	is	a	just	God	in	heaven." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	it	is	something	else.	If	not	a	spirit,	then	a	living	man—a	human	devil—</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	the	police	will	discover	him.	In	this	house,	one	we	have	known	and	trusted; </p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 all	 are	 known	 and	 trusted.	 They	 will	 blame	 me,	 with	 good	 reason,	 for sacrificing	another	life.	The	irony	of	fate	that	I,	of	all	men,	one	so	much	alive	to the	meaning	of	mercy—that	I,	out	of	superstitious	folly—But	how	will	it	look	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 eyes	 of	 justice?	 Black—black!	 I	 am	 well	 prepared	 to	 suffer	 what	 I	 have deserved,	Mary.	Nothing	that	man	can	do	to	me	equals	the	shame	and	dismay	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">feel	when	I	consider	what	I	have	done	to	myself!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	must	not	talk	so;	it	is	unworthy	of	you.	You	know	it,	father,	while	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">speak.	Nobody	has	a	right	to	question	you	or	your	opinions.	Many	would	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 convinced	 by	 Mr.	 May	 last	 night.	 They	 may	 still	 think	 that	 he	 was	 right, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a>and	that,	far	from	receiving	evil	treatment,	he	was	blessed	by	being	taken	away into	the	next	world	without	pain	or	shock.	We	must	feel	for	him	as	we	try	to	feel</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	dear	Tom.	And	I	do	not	mean	that	I	am	sorry	for	him;	I	am	only	sorry	for	us, </p>
<p class="calibre1">because	of	the	difficulty	of	explaining.	Yet	to	tell	the	truth	will	not	be	difficult. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	must	do	the	best	they	can.	It	doesn't	matter	as	much	as	you	think.	Indeed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">how	should	they	blame	you	at	all	until	they	themselves	find	out	the	truth?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	 will—they	 must!	 They	 will	 discover	 the	 reason.	 They	 will	 hunt	 down the	murderer,	and	they	will	inevitably	attach	utmost	blame	to	me	for	listening	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	man	possessed.	May	was	possessed,	I	tell	you!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	was	exceedingly	convincing.	When	I	listened	to	him	he	shook	me,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	should	have	supported	you,	instead	of	going	over	to	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	knows	the	truth	now.	He	is	with	Tom	now.	We	must	remember	that.	We</p>
<p class="calibre1">know	 they	 are	 happy,	 and	 that	 makes	 the	 opinion	 of	 living	 people	 matter	 very little." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	 out	 of	 his	 weakness,	 he	 smote	 her,	 and	 thrust	 upon	 her	 some	 hours	 of agony,	very	horrible	in	their	nature,	which	there	was	no	good	reason	that	Mary</p>
<p class="calibre1">should	have	suffered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who	 is	 alive	 and	 who	 is	 dead?"	 he	 asked.	 "We	 don't	 even	 know	 that.	 The police	demanded	to	make	their	own	inquiries,	and	Peter	Hardcastle	may	at	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment	be	a	living	and	breathing	man,	if	they	are	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stared	at	him	and	feared	for	his	reason. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	do	you	mean?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 mean	 that	 they	 were	 not	 prepared	 to	 grant	 that	 he	 was	 dead.	 Henry	 and Mannering	 took	 him	 up	 on	 that	 assumption.	 He	 may	 have	 been	 restored	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">animation	and	his	vital	forces	recovered.	Why	not?	There	was	nothing	visible	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">indicate	dissolution.	We	have	heard	of	trances,	catalepsies,	which	simulate	death</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	 closely	 that	 even	 physicians	 are	 deceived.	 Have	 not	 men	 been	 buried	 alive? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom's	 father	 at	 this	 moment	 might	 be	 restored	 to	 life,	 if	 we	 only	 knew	 how	 to act." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then—"	she	said,	with	horrified	eyes,	and	stopped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	saw	what	he	had	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"God	 forgive	 me!	 No,	 no,	 not	 that,	 Mary!	 It's	 all	 madness	 and	 moonshine! </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 is	 delirium;	 it	 will	 kill	 me!	 Don't	 think	 I	 believe	 them,	 any	 more	 than Mannering	 did,	 or	 Henry	 did.	 Henry	 has	 seen	 much	 death;	 he	 could	 not	 have been	deceived.	Tom	was	dead,	and	your	heart	told	you	he	was	dead.	One	cannot</p>
<p class="calibre1">truly	make	any	mistake	in	the	presence	of	death;	I	know	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a>Mary	was	marvellously	restrained,	despite	the	fact	that	she	had	received	this appalling	blow	and	vividly	suffered	all	that	it	implied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 will	 try	 to	 put	 it	 out	 of	 my	 mind,	 father,"	 she	 said	 quietly.	 "But	 if	 Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hardcastle	is	alive,	I	shall	go	mad!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	is	not.	Mannering	was	positive." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nevertheless,	he	may	be.	And	if	he	is,	then	Mr.	May	probably	is." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Grotesque,	 horrible,	 worse	 than	 death	 even!	 Keep	 your	 mind	 away	 from	 it, my	darling,	for	the	love	of	God!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who	knows	what	we	can	suffer	till	we	are	called	to	find	out?	No,	I	shall	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">go	mad.	But	I	must	know	to-day.	I	cannot	eat	or	sleep	until	I	know.	I	shall	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">live	long	if	they	don't	tell	me	quickly." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	father	trembled	and	grew	very	white. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This	is	the	worst	of	all,"	he	said.	"These	things	will	leave	a	burning	brand.	I am	ruined	by	them,	and	my	life	thrown	down.	I,	that	thought	I	was	strong,	prove</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	weak	that	I	can	forget	my	own	daughter,	and	out	of	cowardly	misery	speak	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	thing	she	should	never	have	known.	You	have	your	revenge,	Mary,	for	I	shall</p>
<p class="calibre1">go	a	broken	man	from	this	hour.	Nothing	can	ever	be	the	same	again.	My	self-</p>
<p class="calibre1">respect	is	gone.	I	could	have	endured	everything	else—the	things	that	I	dreaded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	I	could	have	suffered	and	survived;	but	to	have	forgotten	and	stabbed	you—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't,	don't—come—we	have	got	each	other,	father—we	have	still	got	each</p>
<p class="calibre1">other.	The	dead	understand	everything.	Who	else	matters?	Go	to	your	room,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">let	 your	 dear	 mind	 rest.	 I	 am	 not	 suffering.	 We	 cannot	 alter	 the	 past,	 and	 who would	wish	it,	if	they	believe	in	eternal	life?	I	would	not	call	Tom	back	if	I	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	power	to	do	so.	Be	sure	of	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 spoke	 comfortable	 words	 to	 him,	 and	 supported	 him	 to	 his	 room.	 She</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew	the	police	would	soon	arrive,	and	though	they	could	not	report	concerning</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	life,	or	death,	of	Peter	Hardcastle,	she	doubted	not	that	definite	information</p>
<p class="calibre1">relating	 to	 him	 must	 come	 to	 Chadlands	 quickly.	 Upon	 that	 another	 life	 might hang.	 Yet,	 when	 the	 medical	 man	 arrived	 from	 Newton,	 he	 could	 only	 say	 that Septimus	May	was	dead.	He	was	a	friend	of	Mannering,	and	knew	the	London</p>
<p class="calibre1">opinion,	 that	 this	 form	 of	 apparent	 death	 might	 in	 reality	 conceal	 latent possibilities	 of	 resuscitation;	 but	 he	 spoke	 with	 absolute	 certainty.	 He	 was	 old, and	had	nearly	fifty	years	of	professional	experience	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 man	 is	 dead,	 or	 I	 never	 saw	 death,"	 he	 declared.	 "By	 a	 hundred independent	 evidences	 we	 can	 be	 positive.	 Post-mortem	 stains	 have	 already</p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared,	and	were	they	ever	known	on	a	living	body?	Of	the	others	who	died	in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a>this	room	I	know	nothing	personally;	but	here	is	death,	and	in	twenty-four	hours the	fact	will	be	plain	to	the	perception	of	an	idiot.	What	has	happened	is	this:	the London	 police	 have	 heard	 of	 a	 famous,	 recent	 German	 case	 mentioned	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">'Deutsche	 Medizinische	 Wochenschraft'—an	 astonishing	 thing.	 A	 woman,	 who</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 taken	 morphine	 and	 barbital,	 was	 found	 apparently	 dead	 after	 a	 night's exposure	in	some	lonely	spot.	There	were	no	reflexes,	no	pulse,	no	respiration	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart-beat.	Yet	she	was	alive—existing	without	oxygen—an	impossibility	as	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	always	supposed.	Seeing	no	actual	evidence	of	death,	the	physicians	injected</p>
<p class="calibre1">camphor	 and	 caffein	 and	 took	 other	 restorative	 steps,	 with	 the	 result	 that	 in	 an hour	the	woman	breathed	again!	Twenty-four	hours	later	she	was	conscious	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">able	 to	 speak.	 It	 is	 assumed	 that	 the	 poison	 and	 the	 cold	 night	 air	 together	 had paralyzed	 her	 vasomotor	 nerves	 and	 reduced	 her	 body	 to	 a	 state	 akin	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">hibernation,	 wherein	 physical	 needs	 are	 at	 their	 minimum.	 That	 case	 has</p>
<p class="calibre1">doubtless	 awakened	 these	 suspicions,	 and	 having	 regard	 to	 them,	 we	 will	 keep the	 poor	 gentleman	 in	 a	 warm	 room	 and	 proceed	 with	 the	 classical	 means	 for restoring	respiration." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 doctor	 was	 thus	 engaged	 when	 four	 men	 reached	 Chadlands	 after	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1">nightly	journey.	They	were	detective	officers	of	wide	reputation,	and	their	chief</p>
<p class="calibre1">—a	 grey-haired	 man	 with	 a	 round,	 amiable	 face	 and	 impersonal	 manner—</p>
<p class="calibre1">listened	 to	 the	 events	 that	 had	 followed	 upon	 Peter	 Hardcastle's	 arrival	 and departure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	 Walter	 himself	 narrated	 the	 incidents,	 and	 perceiving	 his	 excitation, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inspector	Frith	assumed	the	gentlest	and	most	forbearing	attitude	that	he	knew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 police	 had	 come	 in	 a	 fighting	 humor.	 They	 arrived	 without	 any</p>
<p class="calibre1">preconceived	 ideas	 or	 plan	 of	 action;	 but	 they	 were	 in	 bitter	 earnest,	 and	 knew that	 a	 great	 body	 of	 public	 opinion	 lay	 behind	 them.	 That	 Hardcastle,	 who	 had won	 such	 credit	 for	 his	 department	 and	 earned	 the	 applause	 of	 two	 continents, should	have	thus	been	lost,	in	a	manner	so	mean	and	futile,	exasperated	not	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 personal	 colleagues,	 but	 the	 larger	 public	 interested	 in	 his	 picturesque successes	and	achievements. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 new	 arrivals	 felt	 little	 doubt	 that	 their	 colleague	 was	 indeed	 dead,	 nor, when	 they	 heard	 of	 the	 last	 catastrophe,	 and	 presently	 stood	 by	 Septimus	 May, could	 they	 feel	 the	 most	 shadowy	 suspicion	 that	 life	 might	 be	 restored	 to	 him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	 Walter	 found	 his	 nerve	 steadied	 on	 the	 arrival	 of	 these	 men.	 Indeed,	 by comparison	 with	 other	 trials,	 the	 ordeal	 before	 him	 now	 seemed	 of	 no</p>
<p class="calibre1">complexity.	 He	 gave	 a	 clear	 account	 of	 events,	 admitted	 his	 great	 error,	 and answered	all	questions	without	any	further	confusion	of	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 am	 not	 concerned	 to	 justify	 my	 permission	 in	 the	 matter	 of	 Mr.	 May,"	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>concluded.	"I	deeply	deplore	it,	and	bitterly	lament	the	result;	but	my	reasons	for granting	him	leave	to	do	what	he	desired	I	am	prepared	to	justify	when	the	time</p>
<p class="calibre1">comes.	 Others	 also	 heard	 him	 speak,	 and	 though	 he	 did	 not	 convince	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">daughter,	whose	intellect	is	keener	than	my	own,	I	honestly	believed	him	with	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 heart.	 It	 seemed	 to	 me	 that	 only	 so	 could	 any	 reasonable	 explanation	 be reached.	 Moreover,	 you	 have	 to	 consider	 his	 own	 triumphant	 conviction	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">power	 of	 argument.	 Rightly	 or	 wrongly,	 he	 made	 me	 feel	 that	 he	 was	 not</p>
<p class="calibre1">mistaken—indeed,	 made	 me	 share	 his	 resolute	 convictions.	 These	 things	 I	 am prepared	to	explain	if	need	be.	But	that	will	not	matter	to	you.	Personally	I	am</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	 only	 too	 sure	 that	 both	 Septimus	 May	 and	 I	 were	 mistaken.	 I	 realize	 that there	 must	 exist	 some	 physical	 causes	 for	 these	 terrible	 things,	 that	 they	 are	 of human	origin,	and	I	hope	devoutly	that	you	will	be	permitted	by	Providence	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">discover	 them,	 and	 those	 responsible	 for	 them.	 But	 the	 peril	 is	 evidently	 still acute.	The	danger	remains,	and	I	need	not	ask	you	to	recognize	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inspector	 Frith	 answered	 him,	 and	 proved	 more	 human	 than	 Sir	 Walter</p>
<p class="calibre1">expected.	He	was	an	educated	man	of	high	standing	in	his	business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We'll	 waste	 no	 time,"	 he	 said.	 "Perhaps	 it	 is	 as	 well	 you	 are	 convinced,	 Sir Walter,	that	these	things	have	happened	inside	natural	laws,	and	don't	depend	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">beings	 in	 some	 unknown	 fourth	 dimension.	 That	 is	 your	 affair,	 and	 I	 am	 very sure,	 as	 you	 say,	 that	 you	 can	 give	 good	 reasons	 for	 what	 you	 did	 at	 a	 future inquiry,	though	the	results	are	so	shocking.	Poor	Peter	was	taken	back	to	London</p>
<p class="calibre1">last	 night,	 you	 tell	 us,	 according	 to	 directions.	 If	 he's	 in	 the	 same	 case	 as	 this unfortunate	 gentleman,	 then	 there's	 not	 much	 doubt	 about	 his	 being	 dead.	 We must	begin	at	the	beginning,	though	for	us,	naturally,	Hardcastle's	operations	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 failure	 are	 the	 most	 interesting	 facts	 to	 be	 dealt	 with.	 You	 have	 told	 us everything	that	happened	to	him.	But	we	have	not	heard	who	found	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My	nephew,	Henry	Lennox." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	found	Captain	May,	too?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	did.	He	was	the	last	to	see	him	alive,	and	the	first	to	see	him	afterwards." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	he	here?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	 will	 be	 here	 in	 the	 course	 of	 the	 day.	 He	 travelled	 to	 London	 last	 night with	the	body	of	Mr.	Hardcastle." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 doctor,	 Mr.	 Mannering,	 wished	 him	 to	 do	 so.	 He	 desired	 to	 have	 a companion." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Have	you	anything	further	that	you	would	care	to	tell	us?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a>"Only	this,	that	I	think	Mr.	Hardcastle,	with	whom	I	had	a	long	conversation on	his	arrival,	gave	it	as	his	opinion	that	it	was	not	in	the	Grey	Room	we	must</p>
<p class="calibre1">look	 for	 an	 explanation.	 I	 believe	 he	 regarded	 his	 visit	 to	 the	 room	 itself	 as	 a comparatively	unimportant	part	of	the	case.	He	was	really	more	interested	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">life	 of	 my	 son-in-law	 and	 his	 relations	 with	 other	 people.	 I	 think	 he	 regarded May's	death	as	a	matter	which	had	been	determined	outside	the	Grey	Room.	But, </p>
<p class="calibre1">if	I	may	presume	to	advise	you,	this	view	of	his	is	surely	proved	mistaken	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">light	of	his	own	destruction	and	what	has	happened	since.	It	is	certain	now	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	cause	of	danger	lies	actually	in	the	room	itself,	and	equally	certain	that	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">killed	 my	 son-in-law	 also	 killed	 Mr.	 Hardcastle	 and,	 last	 night,	 killed	 the Reverend	Septimus	May." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"On	the	fact	of	it,	yes,"	admitted	Frith.	"I	think,	after	we	have	considered	the situation	now	developed	and	visited	the	Grey	Room,	we	shall	agree	that	there,	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	rate,	we	may	begin	the	work	that	has	brought	us.	You	understand	we	rule	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	possibility	of	any	supernatural	event,	as	Hardcastle,	of	course,	did.	While	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	properly	centred	on	the	history	of	Captain	May,	and,	from	his	point	of	view, </p>
<p class="calibre1">did	not	expect	to	find	the	accident	of	the	captain's	death	in	this	particular	place</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 prove	 important,	 we	 shall	 now	 assume	 otherwise,	 and	 give	 the	 room,	 or somebody	with	access	to	it,	the	credit	for	this	destruction	of	human	life.	We	shall</p>
<p class="calibre1">fasten	on	the	room	therefore.	Our	inquiry	is	fairly	simple	at	the	outset,	simpler</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	 poor	 Hardcastle's.	 It	 will	 lie	 along	 one	 of	 two	 channels,	 and	 it	 depends entirely	upon	which	channel	we	have	to	proceed	whether	the	matter	is	going	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">take	much	time,	and	possibly	fail	of	explanation	at	the	end,	or	but	a	short	time, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	be	swiftly	cleared	up.	I	hope	the	latter." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	shall	be	glad	if	you	can	explain	that	remark,"	answered	Sir	Walter;	but	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Frith	was	not	prepared	immediately	to	do	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fully	when	the	time	comes,	Sir	Walter;	but	for	the	moment,	no—not	even	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">you.	You	will	understand	that	our	work	must	be	entirely	secret,	and	the	lines	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	we	proceed	known	only	to	ourselves." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	is	reasonable,	for	you	cannot	tell	yet	whether	I,	who	speak	to	you,	may</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	be	responsible	for	everything.	At	least,	command	me.	I	only	hope	to	Heaven</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	are	not	going	to	discover	a	great	crime." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	share	your	hope.	That	is	why	I	speak	of	two	channels	for	inquiry,"	answered the	detective.	"Needless	to	say,	we	four	men	shall	discuss	the	new	light	thrown upon	the	situation	very	fully.	At	present	the	majority	of	us	are	inclined	to	believe there	is	no	crime,	and	the	death	of	Mr.	May	does	not,	to	my	mind,	increase	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">likelihood	of	such	a	thing.	Indeed,	it	supports	me,	I	should	judge,	in	my	present</p>
<p class="calibre1">opinion.	What	that	is	will	appear	without	much	delay.	We'll	get	to	our	quarters</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a>now,	and	ask	to	see	the	Grey	Room	later	on." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"May	I	inquire	concerning	Mr.	Hardcastle?	I	hope	he	had	no	wife	or	family	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">mourn	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	 was	 a	 bachelor,	 and	 lived	 with	 his	 mother,	 who	 keeps	 a	 shop.	 The intention	is	to	examine	his	body	this	morning,	and	submit	it	to	certain	conclusive</p>
<p class="calibre1">tests.	 Nobody	 expects	 much	 from	 them,	 but	 they're	 not	 going	 to	 lose	 half	 a chance.	He	was	a	great	man." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	will	hear	at	once	from	London	if	anything	transpires	to	help	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	shall	hear	by	noon	at	latest." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter	left	them	then,	and	Masters	took	the	four	to	their	accommodation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	rooms	were	situated	together	in	the	corridor,	as	near	the	east	end	of	it	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible.	 But	 the	 four	 were	 not	 yet	 of	 one	 mind,	 and	 when	 they	 met	 presently, and	walked	together	in	the	garden	for	an	hour,	it	appeared	that	while	two	of	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">agreed	with	Inspector	Frith,	under	whom	all	acted,	the	fourth	held	to	a	contrary</p>
<p class="calibre1">view,	 and	 desired	 to	 take	 the	 second	 of	 the	 two	 channels	 his	 chief	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">mentioned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus	three	men	believed	some	extraordinary	concatenation	of	circumstances, </p>
<p class="calibre1">probably	mechanical	in	 operation,	was	responsible	 for	all	that	 had	happened	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Grey	Room;	but	the	fourth,	a	man	older	than	Frith,	and	in	some	sort	his	rival</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 many	 years,	 held	 to	 it	 that	 the	 reason	 of	 these	 things	 must	 be	 sought	 in	 an active	and	conscious	agency.	He	trusted	in	a	living	cause,	but	felt	confident	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 was	 not	 a	 sane	 one.	 He	 had	 known	 a	 case	 when	 a	 madman,	 unsuspected	 of madness,	had	operated	with	extraordinary	skill	to	destroy	innocent	persons	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">escape	 detection,	 and	 already	 he	 was	 disposed	 to	 believe	 that	 among	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">household	of	Chadlands	might	hide	such	an	insane	criminal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 a	 similar	 plane,	 it	 was	 in	 his	 personal	 experience	 that	 weak-minded</p>
<p class="calibre1">persons,	possessed	with	a	desire	to	do	something	out	of	the	common,	had	often</p>
<p class="calibre1">planned	 and	 perpetrated	 apparent	 physical	 phenomena,	 and	 created	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">appearance	 of	 supernatural	 visitations,	 only	 exposed	 after	 great	 difficulty	 by professional	 research.	 Along	 such	 lines,	 therefore,	 this	 man	 was	 prepared	 to operate,	 and	 he	 believed	 it	 might	 be	 possible	 that	 a	 maniac,	 in	 possession	 of some	physical	secret,	would	be	found	among	the	inhabitants	of	the	manor	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 did	 not,	 however,	 elaborate	 this	 opinion,	 but	 kept	 it	 to	 himself.	 Indeed,	 the human	 element	 of	 jealousy,	 so	 often	 responsible	 for	 the	 frustration	 of	 the worthiest	 human	 ambitions,	 was	 not	 absent	 from	 the	 minds	 of	 the	 four	 now concerned	with	this	problem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Each	desired	to	solve	it,	and	while	no	rivalry	existed	among	them,	save	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a>case	 of	 the	 two	 older	 men,	 it	 was	 certain	 that	 the	 eldest	 of	 the	 four	 would	 not lose	 his	 hold	 on	 his	 own	 theory,	 or	 be	 at	 very	 vital	 pains	 to	 stultify	 it.	 All, however,	 were	 fully	 conscious	 of	 the	 danger	 before	 them,	 and	 Frith,	 from	 the first,	 directed	 that	 none	 was	 to	 work	 alone,	 either	 in	 the	 Grey	 Room	 or elsewhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	noon	a	telegram	arrived	for	Mr.	Frith	from	Scotland	Yard.	It	recorded	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fact	that	Peter	Hardcastle	was	dead,	and	that	examination	had	revealed	no	cause</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	his	end.	The	news	reached	Sir	Walter	at	once,	and	if	ever	he	rejoiced	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">death	of	a	fellow-creature,	it	was	upon	this	occasion.	It	meant	unspeakable	relief</p>
<p class="calibre1">both	for	him	and	his	daughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 detectives	 began	 their	 operations	 after	 a	 midday	 meal,	 and	 having	 first carefully	studied	the	Grey	Room	in	every	visible	particular,	they	emptied	it	of	its</p>
<p class="calibre1">contents,	and	placed	the	pictures,	furniture,	and	statuette	outside	in	the	corridor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 asked	 for	 no	 assistance,	 and	 desired	 that	 none	 should	 visit	 the	 scene	 of their	 labors.	 The	 apartment,	 empty	 to	 the	 walls,	 they	 examined	 minutely;	 with the	help	of	ladders,	they	investigated	the	outer	walls	on	the	east	and	south	side; </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 they	 probed	 the	 chimney	 from	 above	 and	 below.	 They	 searched	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">adjoining	 room—Mary's	 old	 nursery—to	 satisfy	 themselves	 that	 no</p>
<p class="calibre1">communication	existed,	and	they	drove	an	iron	rod	through	the	walls	in	various</p>
<p class="calibre1">directions,	 only	 to	 prove	 they	 were	 of	 solid	 stone,	 eighteen	 inches	 thick	 within and	 two	 feet	 thick	 without.	 There	 was	 no	 apartment	 on	 the	 other	 side	 of	 the chamber.	It	completed	the	eastern	angle	of	the	house	front,	and	behind	it,	inside, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	corridor	terminated	at	an	eastern	window	parallel	with	the	Grey	Room	oriel, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	flat	and	undecorated—a	modern	window	inserted	by	Sir	Walter's	grandfather</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 lighten	 a	 dark	 corner.	 Not	 a	 foot	 of	 the	 walls	 they	 left	 untested,	 and	 they examined	and	removed	a	portion	of	the	paper	upon	them	also.	Then,	taking	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 carpet,	 they	 broke	 into	 the	 flooring	 and	 skirting	 boards,	 but	 discovered	 no indication	 that	 the	 grime	 and	 dust	 of	 centuries	 had	 ever	 been	 disturbed.	 The desiccated	 mummy	 of	 a	 rat	 alone	 rewarded	 their	 scrutiny.	 It	 lay	 between	 great timbers	under	the	planking—beams	that	supported	the	elaborate	stucco	roof	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">dwelling-room	below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	the	ceiling	of	the	Grey	Room	they	next	turned	their	attention,	fastened	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">electric	 wire	 to	 the	 nearest	 point,	 and,	 through	 a	 trap-door	 in	 the	 roof	 of	 the passage,	investigated	the	empty	space	between	the	ceiling	and	the	roof.	Not	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">inch	of	the	massive	oaken	struts	above	did	they	fail	to	scrutinize,	and	they	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">experiments	 with	 smoke	 and	 water,	 to	 learn	 if,	 at	 any	 point,	 so	 much	 as	 a	 pin-hole	 existed	 in	 the	 face	 of	 the	 stucco.	 But	 it	 was	 solid,	 and	 spread	 evenly	 to	 a considerable	 depth.	 They	 studied	 it,	 then,	 from	 inside	 the	 room,	 to	 discover</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>nothing	but	the	beautifully	modeled	surface,	encrusted	with	successive	layers	of whitewash.	The	workmanship	belonged	to	a	time	when	men	knew	not	to	scamp</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	labors	and	art	and	craft	went	hand	in	hand.	Such	enthusiasms	perished	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 improvement	 of	 education.	 They	 died	 with	 the	 Guilds,	 and	 the	 Unions	 are not	concerned	to	revive	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 detectives	 had	 finished	 this	 examination	 when,	 at	 an	 hour	 in	 the	 late afternoon,	Henry	Lennox	and	Dr.	Mannering	returned.	The	authorities	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">informed	 of	 the	 death	 of	 Septimus	 May,	 and	 desired	 that	 no	 more	 than	 the ordinary	 formalities	 should	 be	 taken,	 unless	 their	 representatives	 at	 Chadlands thought	 otherwise.	 But	 they	 did	 not.	 They	 were	 now	 convinced	 that	 no</p>
<p class="calibre1">communication	 existed	 between	 the	 Grey	 Room	 and	 the	 outer	 world,	 and	 they declared	 their	 determination	 to	 watch	 in	 it	 during	 the	 coming	 night.	 As	 a preliminary	to	this	 course,	however,	they	 examined	each	piece	 of	furniture	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">every	picture	and	other	object	that	they	had	removed	from	the	room.	These	told</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	nothing,	and	presently	they	restored	the	chamber	in	every	particular,	re-laid</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	nailed	the	carpet,	and	placed	each	article	as	it	had	stood	when	they	arrived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 continued	 to	 decline	 assistance,	 and	 made	 it	 clear	 that	 nobody	 was	 to approach	the	end	of	the	corridor	in	which	they	worked.	Alive	to	the	danger,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">believing	 that,	 whatever	 its	 quality,	 four	 men	 could	 hardly	 be	 simultaneously destroyed,	they	prepared	for	their	vigil.	Nor	did	they	manifest	any	fear	of	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">awaited	 them.	 Facts,	 indeed,	 may	 be	 stubborn	 things,	 but	 even	 facts	 will	 not upset	the	convictions	of	a	lifetime.	Not	one	of	the	four	for	an	instant	imagined</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 a	 supernatural	 explanation	 of	 the	 mystery	 existed.	 Their	 minds	 were	 open, and	their	wits,	long	trained	in	problems	obscure	and	difficult,	assured	them	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	problem	was	capable	of	solution	and	within	the	power	of	their	wits	to	solve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	apprehended	no	discovery	from	the	watch	to	be	undertaken;	but,	at	Frith's</p>
<p class="calibre1">orders,	 they	 set	 stolidly	 about	 it,	 as	 a	 preliminary	 to	 the	 proceedings	 of	 the following	day.	Once	proved	that	the	murderous	force	was	powerless	against	men</p>
<p class="calibre1">prepared	and	armed	against	it,	and	the	practical	inquiry	as	to	these	strange	deaths</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	be	entered	upon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 came	 with	 full	 powers,	 and	 designed	 to	 search	 the	 house	 without</p>
<p class="calibre1">warning	on	the	following	morning,	and	examine	all	who	dwelt	in	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter	invited	them	to	dine	with	him,	and	they	did	so.	There	were	present</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	master	of	Chadlands,	Dr.	Mannering—who	asked	to	spend	the	night	there—</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 Henry	 Lennox;	 while	 Masters	 and	 Fred	 Caunter	 waited	 upon	 them.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">detectives	heard	with	interest	the	result	of	the	post-mortem	conducted	during	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">morning,	 and	 related	 incidents	 in	 the	 life	 of	 Peter	 Hardcastle.	 They	 were	 all unfeignedly	amazed	that	a	man	with	such	a	record—one	who	had	carried	his	life</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>in	his	hand	on	many	occasions—should	have	lost	it	thus,	at	noonday	and	without a	 sound	 of	 warning	 to	 his	 fellow-creatures.	 Dr.	 Mannering	 told	 how	 he	 had watched	the	medical	examination,	but	not	assisted	at	it.	All	attempts	to	galvanize</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	 life	 failed,	 as	 the	 experts	 engaged	 immediately	 perceived	 they	 must	 upon viewing	 the	 corpse;	 and	 during	 the	 subsequent	 autopsy,	 when	 the	 dead	 man's body	had	been	examined	by	chemist	and	microscopist,	the	result	was	barren	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	pathological	detail.	No	indication	to	explain	his	death	rewarded	the	search. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	 a	 clue	 or	 suspicion	 existed.	 He	 was	 healthy	 in	 every	 particular,	 and	 his destruction	 remained,	 so	 far,	 inexplicable	 to	 science.	 Hardcastle	 had	 died	 in	 a syncope,	as	the	other	victims;	that	was	all	the	most	learned	could	declare. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Impressed	by	these	facts,	the	four	made	ready,	and	Lennox	observed	that	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">neither	drank	during	their	meal	nor	smoked	after	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	nine	o'clock	they	began	their	work	of	the	night,	but	invited	nobody	to	assist</p>
<p class="calibre1">them,	 and	 begged	 that	 they	 might	 not	 be	 approached	 until	 daylight	 on	 the following	morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Mannering	took	it	upon	himself	earnestly	to	beg	they	would	abandon	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">vigil.	Indeed,	he	argued	strongly	against	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Consider,	gentlemen,"	he	said,	"you	are	now	possibly	convinced	in	your	own minds	 that	 the	 source	 of	 these	 horrible	 things	 is	 to	 be	 found	 outside	 the	 Grey Room,	and	not	in	it.	I	agree	with	you,	so	far.	We	have	reached	a	pitch	where,	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	judgment,	we	are	justified	in	believing	that	some	motiveless	malignity	is	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">work.	 But	 by	 going	 into	 that	 room,	 are	 you	 not	 giving	 somebody	 another</p>
<p class="calibre1">opportunity	to	do	what	has	already	been	done?	Evil	performed	without	motive, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	you	know	better	than	I	can	tell	you,	must	be	the	work	of	a	maniac,	and	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">may	 exist	 in	 this	 house,	 unsuspected	 and	 unguessed,	 a	 servant	 afflicted	 in	 this awful	way.	One	has	heard	of	such	things." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	eldest	of	his	listeners	felt	unspeakable	interest	in	these	remarks,	since	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">own	 opinion	 inclined	 in	 the	 same	 direction.	 He	 was,	 however,	 none	 the	 less chagrined	that	another	should	thus	voice	his	secret	theory.	He	did	not	answer,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	chief	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	 is	 proved,"	 said	 Frith,	 "that	 no	 violence	 overtakes	 those	 subjected	 to	 this ordeal.	 And	 I	 have	 decided	 that	 we	 shall	 not	 be	 in	 danger,	 for	 this	 reason.	 We shall	 be	 armed	 as	 none	 of	 the	 dead	 were.	 Our	 precautions	 will	 preclude	 any possibility	 of	 foul	 play	 from	 a	 material	 assault.	 And,	 needless	 to	 say,	 we contemplate	 no	 other.	 We	 are	 free	 agents,	 and	 I	 should	 not	 quarrel	 with	 any among	us	who	shirked;	but	duty	is	duty,	and	we	have	all	faced	dangers	as	great</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 this—probably	 far	 greater.	 What	 you	 say	 is	 most	 interesting,	 doctor,	 and	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>agree	with	you,	that	outside	the	room	we	must	look	for	the	explanation	of	these murders—if	 murders	 they	 are.	 Upon	 that	 business	 we	 shall	 start	 to-morrow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Forgive	 me	 for	 not	 going	 into	 details,	 because	 we	 have	 our	 personal	 methods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	embrace	the	element	of	surprise,	and,	of	course,	prevent	any	conversation</p>
<p class="calibre1">concerning	what	we	are	going	to	do	until	we	have	done	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Supposing	you	are	all	found	dead	to-morrow?"	asked	Dr.	Mannering	bluntly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	we	are	all	found	dead	to-morrow;	and	others	will	have	the	satisfaction</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	finding	out	why." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	suspect	somebody,	yet	can	absolve	nobody?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Exactly,	 Sir	 Walter.	 I	 said	 pretty	 much	 that	 to	 the	 pressmen,	 who	 forced themselves	in	this	afternoon.	The	accursed	daily	Press	of	this	country	has	saved</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 skin	 of	 more	 blackguards	 than	 I	 like	 to	 count.	 Keep	 them	 and	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">photographers	away.	It	ought	to	be	criminal—their	interference." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	ordered	that	none	was	to	be	admitted	for	a	moment." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	is	always	very	hard	to	keep	them	out.	They	are	cunning	devils,	and	take	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">perverse	 pleasure	 in	 adding	 to	 our	 difficulties.	 Little	 they	 care	 how	 they	 defeat justice	if	they	can	only	get	'copy'	for	their	infernal	newspapers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inspector	Frith	spoke	with	some	warmth;	he	had	little	for	which	to	thank	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">popular	Press. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within	an	hour	the	four	departed,	and	it	was	understood	that	they	should	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	disturbed	until	they	themselves	cared	to	reappear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mannering	 remained	 with	 Sir	 Walter	 and	 Lennox.	 He	 was	 dejected	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">exceedingly	anxious.	But	the	others	did	not	share	his	fears.	The	younger,	indeed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">felt	hopeful	that	definite	results	might	presently	be	recorded,	and	he	went	to	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">bed	very	thankful	to	get	there.	But	Sir	Walter,	now	calm	and	refreshed	by	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">hours	of	sleep	during	the	afternoon,	designed	to	keep	his	own	vigil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Poor	May	lies	in	my	library	to-night,"	he	said,	"and	I	shall	watch	beside	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary	also	wishes	to	do	so.	It	seems	a	proper	respect	to	pay	the	dead.	The	inquest</p>
<p class="calibre1">takes	 place	 to-morrow,	 and	 he	 will	 be	 buried	 in	 his	 parish.	 We	 must	 attend	 the funeral,	Mary	and	I." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	ever	a	man	took	his	own	life,	that	man	did!"	declared	the	doctor. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	IX.	THE	NIGHT	WATCH</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Though	 a	 room	 had	 been	 prepared	 for	 Dr.	 Mannering,	 he	 did	 not	 occupy	 it long.	 The	 early	 hours	 of	 night	 found	 him	 in	 a	 bad	 temper,	 and	 suffering	 from considerable	exacerbation	of	nerves.	He	troubled	little	for	himself,	and	still	less</p>
<p class="calibre1">concerning	 the	 police,	 for	 he	 was	 human,	 and	 their	 indifference	 to	 his	 advice annoyed	 him;	 but	 for	 Sir	 Walter	 he	 was	 perturbed,	 and	 did	 not	 like	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrangements	 that	 he	 had	 planned.	 The	 doctor,	 however,	 designed	 to	 go	 and come	 and	 keep	 an	 eye	 upon	 the	 old	 man,	 and	 he	 hoped	 that	 the	 master	 of Chadlands	 would	 presently	 sleep,	 if	 only	 in	 his	 study	 chair.	 For	 himself	 he suffered	a	somewhat	unpleasant	experience	toward	midnight,	but	had	himself	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">thank	for	it.	He	rested	for	an	hour	in	his	bedroom,	then	went	downstairs,	to	find</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary	and	her	father	sitting	quietly	together	in	the	great	library.	They	were	both</p>
<p class="calibre1">reading,	 while	 at	 the	 farther	 end,	 where	 a	 risen	 moon	 already	 frosted	 the	 lofty windows	above	him,	lay	Septimus	May	in	his	coffin.	Mary	had	plucked	a	wealth</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	white	hothouse	flowers,	which	stood	in	an	old	Venetian	bowl	at	his	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter	was	solicitous	for	the	doctor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	in	bed!"	he	exclaimed.	"This	is	too	bad,	Mannering.	We	shall	have	you ill	next.	You	have	been	on	your	feet	for	countless	hours	and	much	lies	before	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">to-morrow.	 Do	 be	 sensible,	 my	 dear	 fellow,	 and	 take	 some	 rest—even	 if	 you cannot	sleep." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	is	no	sleep	to-night	for	me.	Lord	knows	how	soon	I	may	be	wanted	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">those	fools	playing	with	fire	upstairs." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	cannot	interfere.	For	myself	a	great	peace	has	descended	upon	me,	now</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	initiative	and	the	need	for	controlling	and	directing	is	taken	out	of	my	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	began	to	feel	this	when	poor	Hardcastle	arrived;	but	that	composure	was	sadly</p>
<p class="calibre1">shattered.	 I	 am	 even	 prepared	 for	 the	 needful	 publicity	 now.	 I	 can	 face	 it.	 If	 I erred	in	the	matter	of	this	devoted	priest,	I	shall	not	question	the	judgment	of	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">fellow-men	upon	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fear	 nothing	 of	 that	 sort,"	 answered	 Mannering.	 "Your	 fellow-man	 has	 no right	 to	 judge	 you,	 and	 the	 law,	 with	 all	 its	 faults,	 appreciates	 logic.	 Who	 can question	 your	 right	 to	 believe	 that	 this	 is	 a	 matter	 outside	 human	 knowledge? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your	wisdom	may	be	questioned,	but	not	your	right.	Plenty	would	have	felt	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same.	When	the	mind	of	man	finds	itself	groping	in	the	dark,	you	will	see	that, </p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 huge	 majority	 of	 cases,	 it	 falls	 back	 upon	 supernatural	 explanations	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a>mystery.	This	fact	has	made	fortunes	for	not	a	few	who	profit	by	the	credulity	of human	nature.	Faiths	are	founded	on	it.	May	carried	too	many	guns	for	you.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">honestly	convinced	you	that	his	theory	of	his	son's	death	was	the	correct	theory; </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I,	for	one,	though	I	deplore	the	fact	that	you	came	to	see	with	his	eyes,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">permitted	him	to	do	what	he	believed	was	his	duty,	yet	should	be	the	last	to	think</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	action	open	to	judicial	blame.	No	Christian	judge,	at	any	rate,	would	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	least	right	to	question	you.	In	a	word,	there	is	no	case	yet	against	anybody. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 force	 responsible	 for	 these	 things	 is	 utterly	 unknown,	 and	 if	 ill	 betides	 the men	upstairs,	that	is	only	another	argument	for	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	 Walter	 put	 down	 his	 book—a	 volume	 of	 pious	 meditations.	 Events	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">drawn	 him	 into	 a	 receptive	 attitude	 toward	 religion.	 He	 was	 surprised	 at	 Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mannering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	never	thought	to	hear	you	admit	as	much	as	that.	How	strangely	the	currents</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 mind	 ebb	 and	 flow,	 Mannering.	 Here	 are	 you	 with	 your	 scepticism</p>
<p class="calibre1">apparently	 weakening,	 while	 I	 feel	 thankfully	 assured,	 at	 any	 rate	 for	 the moment,	that	only	a	material	reason	accounts	for	these	disasters." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why?"	asked	the	physician. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Because	against	the	powers	of	any	dark	spirit	Septimus	May	was	safe.	Even</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 he	 been	 right	 and	 his	 prayer	 had	 freed	 such	 a	 being	 and	 cast	 it	 out	 of	 my house,	would	the	Almighty	have	permitted	it	to	rend	and	destroy	the	agent	of	its</p>
<p class="calibre1">liberation?	 May	 could	 not	 have	 suffered	 death	 by	 any	 conscious,	 supernatural means	 if	 our	 faith	 is	 true;	 but,	 as	 he	 himself	 said,	 when	 he	 came	 here	 after	 the death	 of	 his	 boy,	 he	 did	 not	 pretend	 that	 faith	 in	 God	 rendered	 a	 human	 being superior	 to	 the	 laws	 of	 matter.	 If,	 as	 was	 suggested	 at	 dinner	 to-day,	 there	 is somebody	 in	 this	 house	 with	 a	 mind	 unhinged	 who	 has	 discovered	 a	 secret	 of nature	by	which	human	life	can	be	destroyed	and	leave	no	sign,	then	this	dead</p>
<p class="calibre1">clergyman	 was,	 of	 course,	 as	 powerless	 against	 such	 a	 hideous	 danger	 as	 any other	human	being." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	 surely	 such	 a	 theory	 is	 quite	 as	 wild	 as	 any	 based	 on	 supernatural assumptions?	 You	 know	 the	 occupants	 of	 this	 house—every	 one	 of	 them,	 Sir</p>
<p class="calibre1">Walter.	Mary	knows	them,	Henry	knows	them.	I	have	attended	most	of	them	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	 time	 or	 another.	 Is	 there	 one	 against	 whom	 such	 a	 suspicion	 can	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">entertained?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	one	indeed." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Could	 the	 war	 have	 made	 a	 difference?"	 asked	 Mary.	 "We	 know	 how	 shell shock	and	wounds	to	a	poor	man's	head	had	often	left	him	apparently	sound,	yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	reality	weakened	as	to	his	mind." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a>"Yes,	 that	 is	 true	 enough.	 And	 when	 the	 unfortunate	 men	 get	 back	 into everyday	 life	 from	 the	 hospitals,	 or	 endeavor	 to	 resume	 their	 old	 work,	 the weakness	appears.	I	have	seen	cases.	But	of	all	the	men	in	Chadlands	there	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	three	examples	of	any	such	catastrophe.	I	know	a	few	in	the	village—none</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	 one	 can	 speak	 of	 actual	 insanity,	 however.	 Here	 there	 is	 only	 Fred Caunter,	 who	 was	 hurt	 about	 the	 head	 on	 board	 ship,	 but	 the	 injury	 left	 no defect." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fred	is	certainly	as	sane	as	I	am—perhaps	saner,"	admitted	Sir	Walter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	 think	 I	 really	 imagine	 there	 is	 anything	 of	 the	 kind	 here,"	 added Mannering.	"But	if	these	four	men	are	in	a	condition	to	proceed	with	their	work to-morrow,	you	must	expect	them	to	make	a	searching	examination	of	everybody</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 house.	 And	 they	 may	 find	 a	 good	 number	 of	 nervous	 and	 hysterical women,	 if	 not	 men.	 It	 is	 not	 their	 province,	 however,	 to	 determine	 whether people	 are	 weak	 in	 the	 head,	 and	 I	 know,	 as	 well	 as	 you	 do,	 that	 none	 in	 this house	had	any	hand	in	these	disasters." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Never	was	a	family	with	fewer	secrets	than	mine,"	declared	Sir	Walter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	morning	may	bring	light,"	said	Mary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 feel	 very	 little	 hope	 that	 it	 will,"	 answered	 Mannering.	 "The	 inquiry	 will proceed,	 whatever	 happens	 to-night,	 and	 we	 may	 all	 have	 to	 go	 to	 London	 to attend	it.	After	they	have	turned	Chadlands	and	everybody	in	it	upside	down,	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	surely	will,	then	we	may	be	called,	if	they	arrive	at	no	conclusion." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 am	 prepared	 to	 be.	 I	 shall	 not	 leave	 the	 country,	 of	 course,	 until	 I	 receive permission	to	do	so.	It	must	be	apparent	to	everybody	that	I	am,	of	all	men,	if	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	most	involved,	at	least	the	most	anxious	to	clear	this	mystery—that	nobody</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	doubt." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	you	must	conserve	your	strength	and	be	guided,"	said	Mannering.	"I	do beg	of	you	to	retire	now,	and	insist	upon	Mary	doing	the	same.	Nothing	can	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">gained	 by	 the	 dead,	 and	 necessary	 energy	 is	 lost	 to	 the	 living	 by	 this	 irrational vigil.	It	is	far	past	midnight;	I	beg	you	to	retire,	Sir	Walter,	and	Mary,	too.	There is	nothing	that	should	keep	you	out	of	bed,	and	I	urge	you	to	go	to	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	the	elder	refused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Few	will	sleep	under	this	roof	to-night,"	he	said.	"There	is	a	spirit	of	human anxiety	 and	 distress	 apparent,	 and	 naturally	 so.	 I	 will	 stay	 here	 with	 this	 good man.	He	is	better	company	than	many	of	the	living.	I	feel	a	great	peace	here.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">dead	sustains	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	joined	Mannering,	however,	in	an	appeal	to	his	daughter,	and,	satisfied	that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a>their	 friend	 would	 not	 be	 far	 off	 at	 any	 time,	 Mary	 presently	 left	 them.	 She declared	herself	as	not	anxious	or	nervous.	She	had	never	believed	that	anything</p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 natural	 causes	 were	 responsible	 for	 her	 husband's	 death,	 and	 felt	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">assurance	that	morning	would	bring	some	measure,	at	least,	of	explanation.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">went	out	of	the	room	with	Mannering,	and,	promising	her	to	keep	a	close	watch</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	her	father,	the	doctor	left	Mary,	lighted	his	pipe,	and	strolled	to	the	billiard-</p>
<p class="calibre1">room.	Presently	he	patrolled	the	hall	and	pursued	his	own	reflections.	Where	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughts	bent,	there	his	body	unconsciously	turned,	and,	forgetting	the	injunction</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	silent	men	aloft—indeed,	forgetting	them	also	for	a	moment—Mannering</p>
<p class="calibre1">ascended	the	stairs	and	proceeded	along	the	corridor	toward	the	Grey	Room.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	did	not	get	far.	Out	of	the	darkness	a	figure	rose	and	stopped	him.	The	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned	an	electric	torch	on	Dr.	Mannering,	and	recognized	him.	It	appeared	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">while	one	detective	kept	guard	outside,	the	others	watched	within.	At	the	sound</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 voices	 the	 door	 of	 the	 Grey	 Room	 opened,	 and	 in	 the	 bright	 light	 that streamed	 from	 it	 a	 weird	 figure	 stood—a	 tall,	 black	 object	 with	 huge	 and flashing	eyes	and	what	looked	like	an	elephant's	trunk	descending	from	between</p>
<p class="calibre1">them.	 The	 watchers,	 wearing	 hoods	 and	 gas	 masks,	 resembled	 the	 fantastic</p>
<p class="calibre1">demons	 of	 a	 Salvator	 Rosa,	 or	 Fuselli.	 Their	 chief	 now	 accosted	 the	 doctor somewhat	 sharply.	 He	 knew	 his	 name	 and	 received	 his	 apology,	 but	 bade	 him leave	the	corridor	at	once.	"I	must,	however,	search	you	first,"	said	Frith.	"You were	wrong	to	come,"	he	continued.	"This	is	no	time	to	distract	us.	Explain	to-morrow,	please." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	doctor,	after	holding	up	his	hands	and	submitting	to	a	very	close	scrutiny, </p>
<p class="calibre1">departed	and	swore	at	his	own	inadvertence.	He	had	forgotten	that,	in	common</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 everybody	 else	 involved,	 he	 must	 bear	 the	 brunt	 of	 suspicion,	 and	 he perceived	 that	 his	 approach	 to	 the	 Grey	 Room,	 after	 it	 was	 clearly	 understood that	 none	 should	 on	 any	 account	 attempt	 to	 do	 so,	 must	 attract	 unpleasant attention	 to	 himself.	 And	 he	 could	 offer	 no	 better	 excuse	 than	 that	 he	 had forgotten	the	order.	He	apprehended	an	unpleasantness	on	the	following	day,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">wondered	at	himself	that	he	could	have	done	anything	so	open	to	question.	Brain</p>
<p class="calibre1">fag	was	a	poor	excuse,	but	he	had	none	better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	an	hour	he	returned	to	Sir	Walter,	hoping	to	find	him	asleep;	but	the	master</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	Chadlands	was	still	reading,	and	in	a	frame	of	mind	very	quiet	and	peaceful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	regretted	the	forgetfulness	that	had	taken	his	friend	into	the	forbidden	gallery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	am	concerned	for	Mary,"	he	said.	"She	is	only	keeping	up	at	a	terrible	cost of	 nervous	 power.	 It	 is	 more	 than	 time	 that	 she	 was	 away;	 but	 she	 will	 not	 go until	I	am	able	to	accompany	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	should	not	be	long.	We	must	hope	they	will	get	to	the	bottom	of	it	soon,	if</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>not	to-night.	I	am	most	anxious	for	both	of	you	to	be	off." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	design	to	go	to	Italy.	She	shrinks	from	the	Riviera	and	longs	for	Florence, or	some	such	peaceful	place." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	will	be	cold	there." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Cold	won't	hurt	us." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shall	you	shut	up	Chadlands?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Impossible.	 It	 is	 the	 only	 home	 of	 half	 my	 elder	 people.	 But,	 if	 nothing	 is discovered	 and	 we	 are	 still	 left	 without	 an	 explanation,	 I	 shall	 seal	 the	 Grey Room—windows,	 door,	 and	 hearth—unless	 the	 authorities	 direct	 otherwise.	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wish	I	could	fill	the	place	with	solid	stone	or	concrete,	so	that	it	would	cease	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	a	room	at	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	 you	 can't	 do,"	 answered	 the	 practical	 doctor.	 "Such	 a	 weight	 would bring	down	the	ceiling	beneath.	But	you	can	make	it	fast	and	block	it	up	if	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing	beats	them." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	 are	 like	 the	 blind	 moving	 in	 regions	 unfamiliar	 to	 their	 touch,"	 said	 Sir Walter.	"I	had	hoped	so	much	from	the	prayer	of	that	just	man.	He,	indeed,	has</p>
<p class="calibre1">gone	to	his	reward.	He	is	with	the	boy	he	loved	better	than	anything	on	earth;	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 us	 is	 left	 great	 sorrow	 and	 distress.	 Still,	 prayers	 continue	 to	 be	 answered, Mannering.	 I	 have	 prayed	 for	 patience,	 and	 I	 find	 myself	 patient.	 The	 iron	 has entered	my	soul.	The	horror	of	publicity—the	morbid	agony	I	experienced	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knew	my	name	must	be	dragged	through	every	newspaper	in	England—these</p>
<p class="calibre1">pangs	are	past.	My	life	seems	to	have	ended	in	one	sense,	and,	looking	back,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">cannot	 fail	 to	 see	 how	 little	 I	 grasped	 the	 realities	 of	 existence,	 how	 I	 took	 my easy	 days	 as	 a	 matter	 of	 course	 and	 never	 imagined	 that	 for	 me,	 too,	 extreme suffering	 and	 misery	 were	 lying	 in	 wait.	 Each	 man's	 own	 burden	 seems	 the hardest	 to	 bear,	 I	 imagine,	 and	 to	 me	 these	 events	 have	 shrivelled	 the	 very marrow	 in	 my	 bones.	 They	 scorched	 me,	 and	 the	 glare,	 thrown	 from	 the	 larger world	into	the	privacy	of	my	life,	made	me	feel	that	I	could	call	on	the	hills	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">cover	me.	But	now	I	can	endure	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	must	not	look	at	it	so,	Sir	Walter.	Everybody	knows	that	you	have	done</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	 wrong,	 and	 if	 your	 judgment	 is	 questioned,	 what	 is	 it?	 Only	 the	 fate	 every man—great	 or	 small,	 famous	 or	 insignificant—has	 to	 bear.	 You	 can't	 escape</p>
<p class="calibre1">criticism	in	this	world,	any	more	than	you	can	escape	calumny.	It	is	something</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	you	can	now	speak	so	steadfastly,	preserve	such	patience,	and	see	so	clearly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">too.	 But,	 for	 my	 part,	 clear	 seeing	 only	 increases	 my	 anxiety	 to-night.	 I	 don't personally	care	a	button	for	the	welfare	of	those	men,	since	they	declined	to	take</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	advice;	but	I	am	human,	and	as	I	suffer	with	a	sick	patient	and	rejoice	when</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a>he	 recovers,	 so	 I	 cannot	 help	 suffering	 at	 the	 thought	 of	 the	 risk	 these	 four	 are running.	They	sit	there,	I	suppose,	or	else	walk	about.	They	wear	gas	masks,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">carry	weapons	in	their	hands.	But	if	we	are	opposed	to	a	blind,	deaf,	unreasoning</p>
<p class="calibre1">force,	 which	 acts	 unconsciously	 and	 inevitably,	 then	 the	 fate	 of	 ten	 men	 would be	just	as	uncertain	as	the	fate	of	one.	The	thing	operates	by	day	or	night—that</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	 has	 been	 proved—and,	 since	 it	 is	 probably	 acting	 automatically,	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">lightning	or	steam,	how	can	they	escape?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This	 invisible	 death-dealing	 force	 may	 be	 in	 the	 control	 of	 a	 human	 mind, remember." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	is	beyond	the	bounds	of	possibility,	Sir	Walter." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	are	a	rash	man	to	affirm	anything	so	definite,	after	what	you	have	gone</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	with	the	rest	of	us.	Let	me,	in	my	turn,	urge	you	to	go	to	your	rest.	These</p>
<p class="calibre1">things	have	told	upon	you.	You	are	only	flesh	and	blood,	not	iron,	as	you	fancy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	men	are	all	right	so	far." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	get	something	to	eat	and	drink,"	said	Mannering,	"and	leave	you	in	peace for	a	while." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do.	You	will	find	all	you	need	in	the	dining-room.	I	directed	Masters	to	leave ample	there,	in	case	the	detectives	might	want	food." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shall	I	bring	you	something—a	whisky,	and	a	biscuit?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	no.	I	need	nothing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 doctor	 went	 his	 way,	 and	 passed	 an	 hour	 with	 meat	 and	 drink.	 Then	 he felt	an	overpowering	desire	to	sleep,	but	resisted	it,	lighted	his	pipe	again,	and, </p>
<p class="calibre1">resumed	his	march	in	the	hall.	He	listened	presently	at	the	library	door,	and	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">gratified	to	hear	a	gentle	but	steady	snore.	The	sound	pleased	Mannering	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	padded	about	once	more,	resolved	to	keep	awake	until	the	vigil	was	ended. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 he	 would	 go	 to	 bed	 and	 sleep.	 It	 was	 now	 past	 three	 o'clock	 on	 a	 still, winter	 night—a	 lull	 and	 interval	 between	 yesterday's	 storm	 and	 rough	 weather yet	to	come.	The	doctor	went	out	of	doors	for	a	time	and	tramped	the	terrace.	A</p>
<p class="calibre1">waning	moon	had	risen,	and	the	night	was	mild	and	cloudy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bright	light	shot	out	like	fans	into	the	murk	from	the	east	and	south	windows</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	Grey	Room.	Returning	to	the	house,	the	watcher	listened	at	the	foot	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">staircase,	 and	 heard	 the	 mumble	 of	 men's	 voices	 and	 the	 sound	 of	 feet.	 They were	changing	the	guard,	and	the	detective	in	the	corridor	gave	up	his	place	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	from	inside.	All	was	well	so	far. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	Mannering	went	to	the	billiard-room,	lolled	on	the	settee	for	a	time,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">drowsed	through	another	hour.	For	a	few	minutes	he	lost	consciousness,	started</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a>up	to	blame	his	weakness,	and	looked	at	his	watch.	But	he	had	only	slumbered for	five	minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 six	 o'clock	 he	 told	 himself	 that	 it	 was	 morning,	 and	 went	 in	 again	 to	 Sir Walter.	 The	 old	 man	 had	 wakened,	 and	 was	 sitting	 in	 quiet	 reflection	 until daylight	should	outline	the	great	window	above	the	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 night	 has	 been	 one	 of	 peace,"	 he	 declared.	 "The	 spirit	 of	 poor	 May seemed	near	me,	and	I	felt,	too,	as	though	his	son	were	not	far	off,	either.	Is	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">well	with	the	watchers?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 leave	 you	 to	 inquire,	 but	 don't	 go	 too	 near	 them.	 Night	 fades	 over	 the woods,	so	the	day	can	be	said	to	have	begun." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Doubtless	 the	 household	 will	 be	 stirring.	 I	 shall	 go	 and	 inquire,	 if	 they	 will permit	 me	 to	 do	 so.	 Oblige	 me	 by	 staying	 here	 a	 few	 minutes	 until	 I	 call	 my daughter.	I	do	not	want	our	poor	friend	to	be	alone	until	he	leaves	us." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	will	stay	here	for	the	present.	But	don't	let	Mary	be	called	if	she	is	sleeping, and	turn	in	yourself	for	a	few	hours	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	have	slept	off	and	on." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter	left	him	and	ascended	to	the	corridor.	Already	light	moved	wanly	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	windows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stood	at	the	top	of	the	staircase	and	raised	his	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	all	well,	gentlemen?"	he	asked	loudly;	but	he	received	no	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	all	well?"	he	cried	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then	 from	 the	 gloom	 emerged	 Inspector	 Frith.	 He	 had	 doffed	 his	 gas</p>
<p class="calibre1">mask. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter	switched	on	an	electric	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothing,	I	trust,	has	happened?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothing	 whatever,	 Sir	 Walter.	 No	 sign	 or	 sound	 of	 anything	 out	 of	 the common	can	be	recorded." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank	Heaven—thank	Heaven	for	that!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Though	we	had	exhausted	the	possibilities	of	such	a	thing,	we	none	the	less</p>
<p class="calibre1">expected	 gas,"	 explained	 the	 detective.	 "That	 seemed	 the	 only	 conceivable means	 by	 which	 life	 might	 be	 destroyed	 in	 that	 room.	 Therefore	 we	 wore	 gas masks	 of	 the	 latest	 pattern,	 supposed	 to	 defy	 any	 gaseous	 combination	 ever turned	 out	 of	 a	 laboratory.	 It	 is	 well	 known	 that	 new,	 destructive	 gases	 were discovered	 just	 before	 the	 end	 of	 the	 war—gases	 said	 to	 be	 infinitely	 more speedy	 and	 deadly	 than	 any	 that	 were	 employed.	 As	 to	 that,	 and	 whether	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a>Government	has	the	secret	of	them,	I	cannot	say.	But	no	gas	was	liberated	in	the Grey	 Room	 last	 night.	 Otherwise	 a	 rat	 in	 a	 trap	 and	 birds	 in	 a	 cage,	 which	 we kept	by	us,	would	have	felt	it.	The	room	is	pure	enough." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	 Walter	 followed	 him	 down	 the	 corridor,	 and	 chatted	 with	 the	 other	 men also.	They	had	left	the	Grey	Room	and	taken	off	their	masks;	they	looked	weary</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	haggard	in	the	waxing,	white	light	of	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You've	 done	 your	 duty,	 and	 I	 am	 beyond	 measure	 thankful	 that	 no	 evil	 has overtaken	you.	What	can	now	be	prepared	for	you	in	the	way	of	food?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 thanked	 him,	 and	 declared	 that	 in	 an	 hour	 they	 would	 be	 glad	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">breakfast.	 Then	 Sir	 Walter	 went	 to	 his	 own	 apartments,	 rang,	 and	 gave	 the needful	 directions.	 He	 joined	 Mary	 soon	 afterwards,	 and	 she	 shared	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">thanksgivings.	 She	 was	 already	 dressed,	 and	 descended	 immediately	 to	 Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mannering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	 Lennox	 also	 appeared	 soon	 afterwards.	 He	 had	 already	 learned	 from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fred	Caunter	that	the	watchers	were	safely	through	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chadlands	 was	 the	 scene	 of	 another	 inquest,	 and	 again	 a	 coroner's	 jury</p>
<p class="calibre1">declared	that	Septimus	May,	as	his	son	before	him,	had	died	by	the	Hand	of	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later	 in	 the	 day	 the	 dead	 man	 was	 conveyed	 to	 his	 own	 parish,	 and	 two	 days later	Sir	Walter	and	Mary,	with	her	cousin,	attended	the	funeral. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meantime,	 the	 detectives	 began	 their	 serious	 work.	 They	 proceeded	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">system	 and	 upon	 their	 own	 plan.	 They	 omitted	 to	 question	 not	 the	 least	 of	 the persons	 who	 dwelt	 at	 Chadlands,	 and	 inquired	 also	 privately	 concerning	 every member	 of	 the	 house	 party	 there	 assembled	 when	 Tom	 May	 died.	 Into	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sailor's	 private	 life	 they	 also	 searched,	 and	 so	 gradually	 investigated	 every possible	line	of	action	and	point	of	approach	to	his	death.	The	cause	of	this	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	content	to	disregard,	arguing	that	if	an	assassin	could	be	traced,	his	means</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 murder	 would	 then	 be	 learned;	 but,	 from	 the	 first,	 no	 sort	 of	 light	 illumined their	activities,	and	nothing	to	be	regarded	as	a	clue	could	be	discovered,	either</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	Tom	May's	relations	with	the	world,	or	in	the	history	and	character	of	anyone</p>
<p class="calibre1">among	the	many	who	were	subject	for	inquiry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Concerning	 the	 house	 party,	 only	 Ernest	 Travers	 and	 his	 wife	 had	 met	 the sailor	before,	on	the	occasion	of	his	wedding;	while	as	to	the	staff	at	Chadlands, </p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing	transpired	to	indicate	that	any	had	ever	had	occasion	to	feel	affronted	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	act	of	his.	They	were,	moreover,	loyal	to	a	man	and	woman.	They	furnished</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	peculiarities,	and	gave	no	ground	for	the	least	suspicion.	The	case,	in	Frith's</p>
<p class="calibre1">opinion,	was	unique,	because,	despite	the	number	of	persons	it	was	necessary	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">study	 and	 consider,	 in	 none	 of	 their	 relations	 with	 the	 family	 involved	 could</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>there	 be	 found	 a	 shadow	 of	 unfriendly	 intercourse,	 a	 harbored	 grudge,	 or	 a suggestion	 of	 ill-feeling.	 The	 people	 were	 all	 simple	 and	 ingenuous.	 They</p>
<p class="calibre1">declared	and	displayed	nothing	but	regard	for	their	employer,	and	many	of	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 succeeded	 their	 own	 parents	 in	 their	 present	 employment.	 It	 was	 a	 large household,	very	closely	united	by	ties	of	tradition	and	affection.	Henry	Lennox</p>
<p class="calibre1">also	 proved	 above	 suspicion,	 though	 his	 former	 attachment	 to	 Mary	 was	 not concealed.	 It	 needed	 no	 great	 student	 of	 character,	 however,	 to	 appreciate	 his transparent	 honesty	 under	 examination,	 a	 remark	 that	 extended	 to	 Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mannering,	 whose	 incautious	 advent	 in	 the	 corridor	 on	 the	 night	 of	 their	 vigil had	offended	the	watchers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	three	weeks	they	worked	industriously—without	vision,	but	to	the	best	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	experience	and	intellectual	powers.	In	the	familiar	phrase,	they	left	no	stone unturned;	and	following	their	report,	which	frankly	admitted	absolute	failure,	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">small	commission	instituted	a	further	inquiry	on	the	evidence,	and	invited	those</p>
<p class="calibre1">chiefly	concerned	to	attend	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	 Walter,	 his	 daughter,	 Henry	 Lennox,	 and	 Dr.	 Mannering	 were	 examined</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 sympathy	 and	 consideration.	 But	 they	 could	 offer	 no	 opinions,	 throw	 no light,	and	suggest	no	other	lines	of	inquiry	than	those	already	pursued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 the	 world	 the	 mystery	 died	 like	 a	 new	 star,	 which	 was	 blazed	 into	 fame only	 to	 retreat	 or	 diminish	 and	 disappear	 once	 more.	 Fresh	 problems	 and	 new sensations	filled	the	newspapers,	and	a	time	at	last	came	when,	to	his	relief,	Sir</p>
<p class="calibre1">Walter	 could	 open	 his	 morning	 journal	 and	 find	 no	 mention	 of	 Chadlands</p>
<p class="calibre1">therein.	 Architects	 examined	 the	 room	 a	 second	 time,	 and	 the	 authorities	 also gave	 permission	 to	 certain	 notable	 spiritualists	 to	 make	 further	 nocturnal	 and diurnal	vigils	therein,	though	no	solitary	watcher	was	permitted.	Three	came	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">passed	 a	 day	 and	 a	 night	 in	 the	 Grey	 Room.	 They	 were	 rewarded	 with	 no</p>
<p class="calibre1">phenomena	whatever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	master	of	Chadlands	was	at	length	informed	that	he	might	leave	England, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	directed	to	set	a	seal	on	the	Grey	Room,	and	to	treat	it	in	such	a	manner	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	should	no	longer	be	capable	of	entrance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	red	tape	that	had	wound	itself	about	the	tragedy	was	thus	unloosed	at	last, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	the	suffering	pair	made	all	haste	to	get	away.	Its	owner	undertook	to	treat	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Grey	Room	as	directed	on	his	return	from	abroad,	and	meanwhile	had	both	door</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	window	boarded	up	with	heavy	timbers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 household	 was	 long	 since	 restored	 to	 self-possession	 and	 even</p>
<p class="calibre1">cheerfulness.	Some	felt	pride	in	their	passing	publicity,	and	none	expressed	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">fear	 of	 remaining.	 But	 Sir	 Walter	 guessed	 that	 few	 feet	 would	 tread	 the	 great</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a>corridor	until	a	day	was	near	for	his	return. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	X.	SIGNOR	VERGILIO	MANNETTI. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter	persisted	in	his	purpose	and	went	to	Florence.	He	believed	that	here</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary	might	find	distractions	and	novelties	to	awaken	interest	which	would	come</p>
<p class="calibre1">freshly	into	her	life	without	the	pain	and	poignancy	of	any	recollection	to	lessen</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 work	 of	 peace.	 For	 himself	 he	 only	 desired	 to	 see	 her	 returning	 to	 content. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Happiness	 he	 knew	 must	 be	 a	 condition	 far	 removed	 from	 her	 spirit	 for	 many days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	stood	one	evening	on	the	Piazza	of	Michelangelo	and	saw	Florence,	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 city	 of	 dim,	 red	 gold	 extended	 beneath	 them.	 The	 setting	 sunlight	 wove	 an enchantment	over	towers	and	roofs.	It	spread	a	veil	of	ineffable	brightness	upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	city	and	tinged	green	Arno	also,	where	the	river	wound	through	the	midst. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter	was	quietly	happy,	because	he	knew	that	in	a	fortnight	his	friends, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ernest	and	Nelly	Travers,	would	be	at	Florence.	Mary,	too,	prepared	to	welcome</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	 gladly,	 for	 her	 father's	 sake.	 He	 left	 his	 daughter	 largely	 undisturbed,	 and while	 they	 took	 their	 walks	 together,	 the	 old	 man,	 to	 whom	 neither	 music	 nor pictures	 conveyed	 much	 significance,	 let	 her	 wander	 at	 will,	 and	 the	 more readily	because	he	found	that	art	was	beginning	to	exercise	a	precious	influence</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	 Mary's	 mind.	 There	 was	 none	 to	 guide	 her	 studies,	 but	 she	 pursued	 them with	a	plan	of	her	own,	and	though	at	first	the	effort	sometimes	left	her	weary, </p>
<p class="calibre1">yet	 she	 persisted	 until	 she	 began	 to	 perceive	 at	 least	 the	 immensity	 of	 the knowledge	she	desired	to	acquire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Music	 soothed	 her	 mind;	 painting	 offered	 an	 interest,	 part	 sensuous,	 part</p>
<p class="calibre1">intellectual.	 Perhaps	 she	 loved	 music	 best	 at	 first,	 since	 it	 brought	 a	 direct anodyne.	 In	 the	 sound	 of	 music	 she	 could	 bear	 to	 think	 of	 her	 brief	 love	 story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	even	made	her	father	come	and	listen	presently	to	things	that	she	began	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">value. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	minds	inevitably	proceeded	by	different	channels	of	thought,	and	while</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	strove	resolutely	to	occupy	herself	with	the	new	interests,	and	put	away	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">agony	of	the	past,	till	thinking	was	bearable	again	and	a	road	to	peace	under	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">feet	 once	 more,	 Sir	 Walter	 seldom	 found	 himself	 passing	 many	 hours	 without recurrence	 of	 painful	 memories	 and	 a	 sustained	 longing	 to	 strip	 the	 darkness which	 buried	 them.	 To	 his	 forthright	 and	 simple	 intelligence,	 mystery	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">hateful,	 and	 the	 reflection	 that	 his	 home	 must	 for	 ever	 hold	 a	 profound	 and appalling	mystery	often	thrust	itself	upon	his	thoughts,	and	even	inclined	him,	in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>some	moods,	to	see	Chadlands	no	more.	Yet	a	natural	longing	to	return	to	the	old environment,	in	which	he	could	move	with	ease	and	comfort,	gradually	mastered</p>
<p class="calibre1">him,	 and	 as	 the	 spring	 advanced	 he	 often	 sighed	 for	 Devonshire,	 yet	 wondered how	he	could	do	so.	Then	would	return	the	gloomy	history	of	the	winter	rolling</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	his	spirit	like	a	cloud,	and	the	thought	of	going	home	again	grew	distasteful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary,	however,	knew	her	father	well	enough,	and	at	this	lustrous	hour,	while</p>
<p class="calibre1">Florence	 stretched	 beneath	 them	 in	 its	 quiet,	 evening	 beauty,	 she	 declared	 that they	must	not	much	longer	delay	their	return. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Plenty	of	time,"	he	said.	"I	am	not	too	old	to	learn,	I	find,	and	a	man	would indeed	be	a	great	fool	if	he	could	not	learn	in	such	a	place	as	this.	But	though	art can	 never	 mean	 much	 to	 me	 now,	 your	 case	 is	 different,	 and	 I	 am	 thankful	 to know	that	these	things	will	be	a	great	addition	and	interest	to	your	future	life.	I'm a	 Philistine,	 and	 shall	 always	 so	 remain,	 but	 I'm	 a	 repentant	 one.	 I	 see	 my mistake	too	late." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	 a	 new	 world,	 father,"	 she	 said,	 "and	 it	 has	 done	 a	 great	 deal	 for	 an unhappy	 woman—not	 only	 in	 taking	 my	 thoughts	 off	 myself,	 but	 in	 lessening my	suffering,	too.	I	do	not	know	why,	or	how,	but	music,	and	these	great,	solemn</p>
<p class="calibre1">pictures	painted	by	dead	men,	all	touch	my	thoughts	of	dear	Tom.	I	seem	to	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 there	 are	 so	 many	 more	 mighty	 ones	 dead	 than	 living.	 And	 yet	 not	 dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 live	 in	 what	 they	 have	 made.	 And	 Tom	 lives	 in	 what	 he	 made—that	 was my	 love	 for	 him	 and	 his	 for	 me.	 He	 grows	 nearer	 and	 dearer	 than	 ever	 when	 I hear	beautiful	music.	I	can	better	bear	to	think	of	him	at	such	times,	and	it	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">always	help	me	to	remember	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"God	bless	art	if	it	does	so	much,"	he	said.	"We	come	to	it	as	little	children, and	 I	 shall	 always	 be	 a	 child	 and	 never	 understand,	 but	 for	 you	 the	 valuable message	 will	 be	 received.	 May	 life	 never	 turn	 you	 away	 from	 these	 things	 in years	to	come." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Never!	Never!"	she	assured	him.	"Art	has	done	too	much	for	me.	I	shall	not try	to	live	my	life	without	it.	Already	I	feel	I	could	not." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	have	you	seen	to-day?"	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	was	at	the	Pitti	all	the	morning.	I	liked	best	Fra	Bartolommeo's	great	altar piece	and	Titian's	portrait	of	Cardinal	Ippolito	dei	Medici.	You	must	see	him—a</p>
<p class="calibre1">strange,	unhappy	spirit	only	twenty-three	years	old.	Two	years	afterwards	he	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">poisoned,	 and	 his	 haunted,	 discontented	 eyes	 closed	 for	 ever.	 And	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">'Concert'—so	 wonderful,	 with	 such	 a	 hunger-starved	 expression	 in	 the	 soul	 of the	 player.	 And	 Andrea	 del	 Sarto—how	 gracious	 and	 noble;	 but	 Henry	 James</p>
<p class="calibre1">says	he's	second-rate,	because	his	mind	was	second-rate,	so	I	suppose	he	is,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>not	to	me.	He	never	will	be	to	me.	To-morrow	you	must	come	and	see	some	of the	 things	 I	 specially	 love.	 I	 won't	 bore	 you.	 I	 don't	 know	 enough	 to	 bore	 you yet.	Oh,	and	Allori's	'Judith'—so	lovely,	but	I	wonder	if	Allori	did	justice	to	her? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly	his	'Judith'	could	never	have	done	what	the	real	Judith	did.	And	there's</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	landscape	by	Rubens—dark	and	old—yet	it	reminded	me	of	our	woods	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	open	out	above	the	valley." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	devoted	the	next	morning	to	Mary,	and	wandered	among	the	pictures	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">her.	 He	 strove	 to	 share	 her	 enthusiasm,	 and,	 indeed,	 did	 so	 sometimes.	 Then occurred	a	little	incident,	so	trivial	that	they	forgot	all	about	it	within	an	hour,	yet were	reminded	of	it	at	a	very	startling	moment	now	fast	approaching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 had	 separated,	 and	 Sir	 Walter's	 eye	 was	 caught	 by	 a	 portrait.	 But	 he forgot	it	a	moment	later	in	passing	interest	of	a	blazoned	coat	of	arms	upon	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">frame—a	 golden	 bull's	 head	 on	 a	 red	 ground.	 The	 heraldic	 emblem	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">tarnished	and	inconspicuous,	yet	the	spectator	felt	curiously	conscious	that	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	unfamiliar.	It	seemed	that	he	had	seen	it	already	somewhere.	He	challenged</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary	with	it	presently;	but	she	had	never	observed	it	before	to	her	recollection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	 Walter	 enjoyed	 his	 daughter's	 interest,	 and	 finding	 that	 his	 company</p>
<p class="calibre1">among	the	pictures	added	to	Mary's	pleasure,	while	his	comments	caused	her	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">apparent	pain,	he	declared	his	intention	of	seeing	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	must	tell	me	what	you	know,"	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	will	be	the	blind	leading	the	blind,	dearest,"	she	answered,	"but	my	delight must	be	in	finding	things	I	think	you'll	like.	The	truth	is	that	neither	of	us	knows anything	about	what	we	ought	to	like." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	a	very	small	matter,"	he	declared.	"We	must	begin	by	learning	to	like pictures	 at	 all.	 When	 Ernest	 comes,	 he	 will	 want	 us	 to	 live	 in	 his	 great	 touring car	 and	 fly	 about,	 so	 we	 should	 use	 our	 present	 time	 to	 the	 best	 advantage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pictures	 do	 not	 attract	 him,	 and	 he	 will	 be	 very	 much	 surprised	 to	 hear	 that	 I have	been	looking	at	them." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	must	interest	him,	too,	if	we	can." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	 would	 be	 impossible.	 Ernest	 does	 not	 understand	 pictures,	 and	 music gives	 him	 no	 pleasure.	 He	 regards	 art	 with	 suspicion,	 as	 a	 somewhat	 unmanly thing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Poor	Mr.	Travers!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	not	pity	him,	Mary.	His	life	is	sufficiently	full	without	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	I've	lived	to	find	out	that	no	life	can	be."	In	due	course	Ernest	and	Nelly arrived,	and,	as	Sir	Walter	had	prophesied,	their	pleasure	consisted	in	long	motor</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a>drives	to	neighboring	places	and	scenes	of	interest	and	beauty.	His	daughter,	in the	new	light	that	was	glimmering	for	her,	found	her	father's	friends	had	shrunk	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">little.	 She	 could	 speak	 with	 them	 and	 share	 their	 interests	 less	 whole-heartedly than	of	old;	but	they	set	it	down	to	her	tribulation	and	tried	to	"rouse"	her.	Ernest Travers	 even	 lamented	 her	 new-found	 interests	 and	 hoped	 they	 were	 "only	 a passing	phase." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	 appears	 to	 escape	 from	 reality	 into	 a	 world	 of	 pictures	 and	 music,"	 he said.	 "You	 must	 guard	 against	 that,	 my	 dear	 Walter.	 These	 things	 can	 be	 of	 no permanent	interest	to	a	healthy	mind." </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 a	 fortnight	 they	 saw	 much	 of	 their	 friends,	 and	 Mary	 observed	 how	 her father	 expanded	 in	 the	 atmosphere	 of	 Ernest	 and	 Nelly.	 They	 understood	 each other	so	well	and	echoed	so	many	similar	sentiments	and	convictions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ernest	 entertained	 a	 poor	 opinion	 of	 the	 Italian	 character.	 He	 argued	 that	 a nation	which	depended	for	its	prosperity	on	wines	and	silk—"and	such	wines"—</p>
<p class="calibre1">must	have	too	much	of	the	feminine	in	it	to	excel.	He	had	a	shadowy	idea	that	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">understood	the	language,	though	he	could	not	speak	nor	write	it	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We,	who	have	been	nurtured	at	Eton	and	Oxford,	remember	enough	Latin	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand	these	people,"	he	said,	"for	what	is	Italian	but	the	emasculated	tongue of	ancient	Rome?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nelly	Travers	committed	herself	to	many	utterances	as	idiotic	as	Ernest's,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary	secretly	wondered	to	find	how	shadowy	and	ridiculous	such	solid	people</p>
<p class="calibre1">showed	 in	 a	 strange	 land.	 They	 carried	 their	 ignorance	 and	 their	 parochial atmosphere	with	them	as	openly	and	unashamedly	as	they	carried	their	luggage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 was	 not	 sorry	 to	 leave	 them,	 for	 she	 and	 her	 father	 intended	 to	 stop	 for	 a while	at	Como	before	returning	home	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	 friends	 were	 going	 to	 motor	 over	 the	 battlefields	 of	 France	 presently, and	both	Ernest	and	Nelly	came	to	see	Sir	Walter	and	his	daughter	off	for	Milan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Travers	rushed	to	the	door	of	the	carriage	and	thrust	in	a	newspaper	as	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">train	moved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	have	secured	a	copy	of	last	week's	'Field,'	Walter,"	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	passed	over	the	Apennines	on	a	night	when	the	fire-flies	flashed	in	every</p>
<p class="calibre1">thicket	under	the	starry	gloom	of	a	clear	and	moonless	sky;	and	when	the	train</p>
<p class="calibre1">stopped	at	little,	silent	stations	the	throb	of	nightingales	fell	upon	their	ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	circumstances	prevented	their	visit	to	the	Larian	Lake,	for	at	Milan	letters</p>
<p class="calibre1">awaited	 Sir	 Walter	 from	 home,	 and	 among	 them	 one	 that	 hastened	 his	 return. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	 a	 stranger	 it	 came,	 and	 chance	 willed	 that	 the	 writer,	 an	 Italian,	 had actually	made	the	journey	from	Rome	to	London	in	order	that	he	might	see	Sir</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>Walter,	while	all	the	time	the	master	of	Chadlands	happened	to	be	within	half	a day's	travel.	Now,	the	writer	was	still	in	London,	and	proposed	to	stop	there	until</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 should	 receive	 an	 answer	 to	 his	 communication.	 He	 wrote	 guardedly,	 and made	one	statement	of	extraordinary	gravity.	He	was	concerned	with	the	mystery</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 Grey	 Room,	 and	 believed	 that	 he	 might	 throw	 some	 light	 upon	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">melancholy	incidents	recorded	concerning	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	 Walter	 hesitated	 for	 Mary's	 sake,	 but	 was	 relieved	 when	 she	 suggested	 a prompt	return. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	would	be	folly	to	delay,"	she	said.	"This	means	quite	as	much	to	me	as	to you,	 father,	 and	 I	 could	 not	 go	 to	 Como	 knowing	 there	 may	 be	 even	 the	 least gleam	of	light	for	us	at	home.	Nothing	can	alter	the	past,	but	if	it	were	possible</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	explain	how	and	why—what	an	unutterable	relief	to	us	both!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Henry	was	to	meet	us	at	Menaggio." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	will	be	as	thankful	as	we	are	if	anything	comes	of	this.	He	doesn't	leave</p>
<p class="calibre1">England	till	Thursday,	and	can	join	us	at	Chadlands	instead." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 only	 live	 to	 explain	 these	 things,"	 confessed	 her	 father.	 "I	 would	 give	 all that	I	have	to	discover	reasons	for	the	death	of	your	dear	husband.	But	there	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">terribly	grave	hints	here.	I	can	hardly	imagine	this	man	is	justified	in	speaking	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">'crime.'	Would	the	word	mean	less	to	him	than	to	us?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	 writes	 perfect	 English.	 Whatever	 may	 be	 in	 store,	 we	 must	 face	 it hopefully.	Such	things	do	not	happen	by	chance." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	is	evidently	a	gentleman—a	man	of	refinement	and	delicate	feeling.	I	am</p>

<p class="calibre1">The	 letter,	 which	 both	 read	 many	 times,	 revealed	 the	 traits	 that	 Sir	 Walter declared.	 It	 was	 written	 with	 Latin	 courtesy	 and	 distinction.	 There	 were	 also touches	of	humor	in	it,	which	neither	he	nor	Mary	perceived:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Claridge's	Hotel,	London.	April	9. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Dear	Sir	Walter	Lennox,—In	common	with	the	rest	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world	that	knows	England,	I	have	recently	been	profoundly</p>
<p class="calibre1">interested	and	moved	at	the	amazing	events	reported	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">happening	at	Chadlands,	in	the	County	of	Devon,	under	your</p>
<p class="calibre1">roof.		The	circumstances	were	related	in	Italian	journals</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	no	great	detail,	but	I	read	them	in	the	'Times' </p>
<p class="calibre1">newspaper,	being	familiar	with	your	language	and	a	great</p>
<p class="calibre1">lover	of	your	country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	had	already	conceived	the	idea	of	communicating	with	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">when—so	small	is	the	world	in	this	our	time—accident</p>
<p class="calibre1">actually	threw	me	into	the	society	of	one	of	your	personal</p>
<p class="calibre1">friends.		At	an	entertainment	given	by	the	British	Ambassador</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	Rome,	a	young	soldier,	one	Colonel	Vane,	was	able	to	do</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>				me	some	service	in	a	crush	of	people,	and	I	enjoyed	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">privilege	of	his	acquaintance	as	the	result.		I	would	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	inflicted	myself	upon	another	generation,	but	he	took</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	interest	in	conversing	with	one	who	knew	his	own	language. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	also	intelligent—for	a	military	man.		Needless	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">say,	he	made	no	allusion	to	the	tragedy	at	Chadlands,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	he	spoke	of	espionage	in	war	and	kindred	matters,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">found	him	familiar	with	the	details	concerning	the	death	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	great	English	detective,	Peter	Hardcastle.		I	then	asked</p>
<p class="calibre1">him,	as	being	myself	deeply	interested	in	the	matter,	whether</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	would	be	possible	to	get	further	and	fuller	details	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">story	of	'the	Grey	Room,'	whereupon	he	told	me,	to	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">amazement,	that	he	had	been	at	Chadlands	when	your	lamented</p>
<p class="calibre1">son-in-law,	Captain	Thomas	May,	passed	out	of	life.		I	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">recollected	Colonel	Vane's	name,	among	others	mentioned	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	'Times,'	as	at	Chadlands	when	the	disaster	occurred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Finding	that	my	curiosity	was	not	idle,	Colonel	Vane	accepted</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	invitation	to	dinner,	and	I	enjoyed	the	pleasure	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">entertaining	him	and	learning	many	personal	and	intimate</p>
<p class="calibre1">particulars	of	the	event.		These	were	imparted	in	confidence, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	he	knew	that	I	should	not	abuse	his	trust.		Indeed,	I	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">already	told	him	that	it	was	my	determination	to	communicate</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	you	upon	the	strength	of	his	narrative. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	seems	improbable	that	anything	I	can	say	will	bear	upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	case,	and	I	may	presently	find	that	I	lack	the	means	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">serve	you,	or	throw	light	where	all	is	so	profoundly	buried</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	darkness.		Yet	I	am	not	sure.		Small	things	will	often</p>
<p class="calibre1">lead	to	greater,	and	though	the	past	is	unhappily	beyond</p>
<p class="calibre1">recall,	since	our	Maker	Himself	cannot	undo	the	work	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">yesterday,	or	obliterate	events	embalmed	in	vanished	time, </p>
<p class="calibre1">yet	there	is	always	the	future;	and	if	we	could	but	read</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	past	aright,	which	we	never	can,	then	the	future	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">prove	less	of	a	painful	riddle	than	mankind	generally</p>

<p class="calibre1">"If,	then,	I	can	help	you	to	read	the	past,	I	may	at	least</p>

<p class="calibre1">imperative	that	I	place	myself	at	your	service	for	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">committed,	and	the	situation	is	possibly	such	that	further</p>
<p class="calibre1">capital	crimes	will	follow	it.		I	affirm	nothing,	but	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">conceive	the	agency	responsible	for	these	murders	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	still	active,	since	the	police	have	been	so	completely</p>
<p class="calibre1">foiled.		At	Chadlands	there	may	still	remain	an	unsleeping</p>
<p class="calibre1">danger	to	those	who	follow	you—a	danger,	indeed,	to	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">human	life,	so	long	as	it	is	permitted	to	persist.		I	write, </p>
<p class="calibre1">of	course,	assuming	you	to	be	desirous	of	clearing	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">abominable	mystery,	both	for	your	own	satisfaction	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">credit	of	your	house.		"There	is	but	little	to	hope	from	me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I	would	beg	you	not	to	feel	sanguine	in	any	way.		Yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	I	do	believe:	that	if	there	is	one	man	in	the	world</p>
<p class="calibre1">to-day	who	holds	the	key	of	your	tribulation,	I	am	that	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	lives	in	hope	that	one	may	empty	the	world	of	so	great	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">horror;	and	to	do	so	would	give	one	the	most	active</p>
<p class="calibre1">satisfaction.		But	I	promise	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	I	should	be	on	the	right	track,	however,	let	me	explain</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	direction	in	which	my	mind	is	moving.		Human	knowledge</p>
<p class="calibre1">may	not	be	equal	to	any	solution,	and	I	may	fail	accordingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	may	even	be	possible	that	the	Rev.	Septimus	May	did	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">err,	and	that	at	the	cost	of	his	life	he	exorcised	some</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a>				spirit	whose	operations	were	permitted	for	reasons	hid	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	mind	of	its	Creator;	but,	so	far	as	I	am	concerned,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe	otherwise.		And	if	I	should	prove	correct,	it	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	possible	to	show	that	all	has	fallen	out	in	a	manner</p>
<p class="calibre1">consonant	with	human	reason	and	explicable	by	human</p>
<p class="calibre1">understanding.		I	therefore	came	to	England,	glad	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">excuse	to	do	so,	and	waited	upon	you	at	your	manor,	only	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear,	much	to	my	chagrin,	that	you	were	not	in	residence, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	had	gone	to	Florence,	a	bird's	journey	from	my	own	home! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now	I	write	to	the	post-office	at	Milan,	where	your	servant</p>
<p class="calibre1">directed	me	that	letters	should	for	the	moment	be	sent.		If</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	are	returning	soon,	I	wait	for	you.		If	not,	it	may	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible	to	meet	in	Italy.		But	I	should	prefer	to	think</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	return	ere	long,	for	I	cannot	be	of	practical	service</p>
<p class="calibre1">until	I	have	myself,	with	your	permission,	visited	your</p>
<p class="calibre1">house	and	seen	the	Grey	Room	with	my	own	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	beg	you	will	accept	my	assurances	of	kindly	regard	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sympathy	in	the	great	sufferings	you	and	Madame	May	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	called	upon	to	endure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Until	I	hear	from	you,	I	remain	at	Claridge's	Hotel	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">London. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	have	the	honor	to	be, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Faithfully	yours, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Vergilio	Mannetti." </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	 this	 communication,	 albeit	 he	 felt	 little	 hope,	 Sir	 Walter	 made	 speedy response.	He	declared	his	intention	of	returning	to	England	during	the	following</p>
<p class="calibre1">week,	 after	 which	 he	 hoped	 that	 Signor	 Mannetti	 would	 visit	 Chadlands	 at	 any time	convenient	to	himself.	He	thanked	him	gratefully,	but	feared	that,	since	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Italian	 based	 his	 theory	 on	 a	 crime,	 he	 could	 not	 feel	 particularly	 sanguine,	 for the	possibility	of	such	a	thing	had	proved	non-existent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary,	 however,	 looked	 deeper	 into	 the	 letter.	 She	 even	 suspected	 that	 the writer	himself	entertained	a	greater	belief	in	his	powers	than	he	declared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"One	 has	 always	 felt	 the	 Grey	 Room	 is	 somehow	 associated	 with	 Italy,"	 she said.	"The	ceiling	we	know	was	moulded	by	Italians	in	Elizabeth's	day." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	was;	but	so	are	all	the	other	moulded	ceilings	in	the	house	as	well." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	 may	 understand	 Italian	 workmanship,	 and	 know	 some	 similar	 roof	 that hid	a	secret." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 roof	 cannot	 conceal	 an	 assassin,	 and	 he	 clearly	 believes	 himself	 on	 the track	 of	 a	 crime."	 Nevertheless,	 Sir	 Walter's	 interest	 increased	 as	 the	 hour approached	 for	 their	 return	 home.	 Only	 when	 that	 was	 decided	 did	 he	 discover how	much	he	longed	to	be	there.	For	the	horror	and	suffering	of	the	past	were	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	dimmed	already;	he	thirsted	to	see	his	woods	and	meadows	in	their	vernal</p>
<p class="calibre1">dress,	 to	 hear	 the	 murmur	 of	 his	 river,	 and	 move	 again	 among	 familiar	 voices and	familiar	paths. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a>Chadlands	welcomed	them	on	a	rare	evening	of	May,	and	the	very	genuine	joy of	his	people	moved	Sir	Walter	not	a	little.	Henry	Lennox	was	already	arrived, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	deeply	interested	to	read	the	Italian's	letter.	He	and	Mary	walked	presently	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 gardens	 and	 he	 found	 her	 changed.	 She	 spoke	 more	 slowly,	 laughed	 not	 at all.	 But	 she	 had	 welcomed	 him	 with	 affection,	 and	 been	 interested	 to	 learn	 all that	he	had	to	tell	her	of	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	felt	that	it	would	disappoint	you	to	be	stopped	at	the	last	moment,"	she	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"but	I	knew	the	reason	would	satisfy	you	well	enough.	I	feel	hopeful	somehow; </p>
<p class="calibre1">father	does	not.	Yet	it	is	hope	mixed	with	fear,	for	Signor	Mannetti	speaks	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">great	crime." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	vain	theory,	I'm	afraid.	Tell	me	about	yourself.	You	are	well?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	 very	 well.	 You	 must	 come	 to	 Italy	 some	 day,	 Henry,	 and	 let	 me	 show you	the	wonderful	things	I	have	seen." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	should	dearly	love	it.	I'm	such	a	Goth.	But	it's	only	brutal	laziness.	I	want	to take	up	art	and	understand	a	little	of	what	it	really	matters." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	have	it	in	you.	Are	you	writing	any	more	poetry?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothing	worth	showing	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	exercised	the	old	fascination;	but	he	indulged	in	no	hope	of	the	future.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew	what	her	husband	had	been	to	Mary,	despite	the	shortness	of	their	union; </p>
<p class="calibre1">and,	rightly,	he	felt	positive	that	she	would	never	marry	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 mournful	 spectacle	 appeared,	 drawn	 by	 the	 sound	 of	 well-known	 voices, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	the	old	spaniel,	Prince,	crept	to	Mary's	feet.	He	offered	feeble	homage,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	made	much	of	him,	but	the	dog	had	sunk	to	a	shadow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	 must	 be	 put	 away,	 poor	 old	 beggar;	 it's	 cruel	 to	 keep	 him	 alive.	 Only Masters	 said	 he	 was	 determined	 he	 should	 not	 go	 while	 Uncle	 Walter	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">abroad.	Masters	has	been	a	mother	to	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tell	father	that;	he	may	blame	Masters	for	letting	him	linger	on	like	this.	He rather	 hoped,	 I	 know,	 that	 poor	 Prince	 would	 be	 painlessly	 destroyed,	 or	 die, before	he	came	back." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Masters	would	never	have	let	him	die	unless	directed	to	do	so." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	 I'm	 sure	 father	 could	 never	 have	 written	 the	 words	 down	 and	 posted them.	You	know	father." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Letters	awaited	the	returned	travellers,	one	from	Colonel	Vane,	who	described</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 meeting	 with	 Signor	 Mannetti,	 and	 hoped	 something	 might	 come	 of	 it;	 and another	from	the	stranger	himself.	He	expressed	satisfaction	at	his	invitation,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">proposed	 arriving	 at	 Chadlands	 on	 the	 following	 Monday,	 unless	 directions</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>reached	him	to	the	contrary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 the	 time	 came,	 Sir	 Walter	 himself	 went	 into	 Exeter	 to	 meet	 his	 guest and	 bring	 him	 back	 by	 motor-car.	 At	 first	 sight	 of	 the	 signor,	 his	 host experienced	a	slight	shock	of	astonishment	to	mark	the	Italian's	age.	For	Vergilio</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mannetti	 was	 an	 ancient	 man.	 He	 had	 been	 tall,	 but	 now	 stooped,	 and,	 though not	decrepit,	yet	he	needed	assistance,	and	was	accompanied	and	attended	by	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">middle-aged	 Italian.	 The	 traveller	 displayed	 a	 distinguished	 bearing.	 He	 had	 a brown,	clean-shaved	face,	the	skin	of	which	appeared	to	have	shrunk	rather	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrinkled,	 yet	 no	 suggestion	 of	 a	 mummy	 accompanied	 this	 physical	 accident. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 hair	 was	 still	 plentiful,	 and	 white	 as	 snow;	 his	 dark	 eyes	 were	 undimmed, and	 proved	 not	 only	 brilliant	 but	 wonderfully	 keen.	 He	 told	 them	 more	 than once,	 and	 indeed	 proved,	 that	 behind	 large	 glasses,	 that	 lent	 an	 owl-like expression	 to	 his	 face,	 his	 long	 sight	 was	 unimpaired.	 His	 rather	 round	 face sparkled	with	intelligence	and	humor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 owned	 to	 eighty	 years,	 yet	 presented	 an	 amazing	 vitality	 and	 a	 keen</p>
<p class="calibre1">interest	in	life	and	its	fulness.	The	old	man	had	played	the	looker-on	at	human</p>
<p class="calibre1">existence,	 and	 seemed	 to	 know	 as	 much,	 if	 not	 more,	 of	 the	 game	 than	 the players.	He	confessed	to	this	attitude	and	blamed	himself	for	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	have	never	done	a	stroke	of	honest	work	in	my	life,"	he	said.	"I	was	born with	the	silver	spoon	in	my	mouth.	Alas,	I	have	been	amazingly	lazy;	it	was	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">metier	to	look	on.	I	ought,	at	least,	to	have	written	a	book;	but	then	all	the	things I	wanted	to	say	have	been	so	exquisitely	said	by	Count	Gobineau	in	his	immortal</p>
<p class="calibre1">volumes,	that	I	should	only	have	been	an	echo.	The	world	is	too	full	of	echoes	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	is.	Believe	me,	if	I	had	been	called	to	work	for	my	living,	I	should	have	cut	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">respectable	figure,	for	I	have	an	excellent	brain." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	know	England,	signor?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"When	 I	 tell	 you	 that	 I	 married	 an	 English-woman,	 and	 that	 both	 my	 sons have	English	blood	in	their	veins,	you	will	realize	the	sincerity	of	my	devotion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	dear	wife	was	a	Somerset." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary	 May	 always	 declared	 that	 the	 old	 Italian	 won	 her	 heart	 and	 even</p>
<p class="calibre1">awakened	 something	 akin	 to	 affection	 before	 she	 had	 known	 him	 half	 an	 hour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 a	 fascination	 in	 his	 admixture	 of	 childish	 simplicity	 and	 varied knowledge.	 None,	 indeed,	 could	 resist	 his	 gracious	 humor	 and	 old-world</p>
<p class="calibre1">courtesies.	 The	 old	 man	 could	 be	 simple	 and	 ingenuous,	 too;	 but	 only	 when	 it pleased	 him	 so	 to	 be;	 and	 it	 was	 not	 the	 second	 childishness	 of	 age,	 for	 his intellect	remained	keen	and	moved	far	more	swiftly	than	any	at	Chadlands.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	was	modest	and	loved	a	jest.	The	hand	of	time	had	indeed	touched	him,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a>sometimes	his	memory	broke	down	and	he	faltered	with	a	verbal	difficulty;	but this	only	appeared	to	happen	when	he	was	weary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 morning	 is	 my	 good	 time,"	 he	 told	 them.	 "You	 will,	 I	 fear,	 find	 me	 a stupid	old	fellow	after	dinner." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Signor	 Mannetti	 proved	 a	 tremendous	 talker,	 and	 implicitly	 revealed	 that	 he belonged	 to	 the	 nobility	 of	 his	 country,	 and	 that	 he	 enjoyed	 the	 friendship	 of many	notable	men.	The	subject	of	his	visit	was	not	mentioned	on	the	day	of	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrival.	He	spoke	only	of	Italy,	laughed	to	think	he	had	passed	through	Florence</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 seek	 Sir	 Walter	 in	 England,	 and	 then,	 finding	 his	 hostess	 a	 neophyte	 at	 the shrines	of	art,	attuned	himself	to	the	subject	for	her	benefit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	 you	 found	 pictures	 answer	 to	 an	 unknown	 need	 within	 yourself,	 that	 is very	 well,"	 he	 declared.	 "About	 music	 I	 know	 little;	 but	 concerning	 painting	 a great	deal.	And	you	desire	to	know,	too,	I	see.	The	spirit	is	willing,	but	the	spirit probably	 does	 not	 know	 yet	 what	 lies	 in	 front	 of	 it.	 You	 are	 groping—blind, childlike—without	a	hand	to	guard	and	an	authority	to	guide.	That	is	merely	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">waste	time.	When	you	go	back	to	Italy,	you	must	begin	at	the	beginning,	if	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	in	earnest—not	at	the	middle.	Only	ignorance	measures	art	in	terms	of	skill, </p>
<p class="calibre1">for	there	are	no	degrees	in	art.	None	has	transcended	Giotto,	because	technique</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 draughtsmanship	 are	 accidents	 of	 time;	 they	 lie	 outside	 the	 soul	 of	 the matter.	Art	is	in	fact	a	static	thing.	It	changes	as	the	face	of	the	sea	changes,	from hour	to	hour;	but	it	does	not	progress.	There	are	great	and	small	artists	and	great</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 small	 movements,	 as	 there	 are	 great	 and	 small	 waves,	 brisk	 breezes	 and terrific	tempests;	but	all	are	moulded	of	like	substance.	In	the	one	case	art,	in	the other,	the	ocean,	remains	unchanged.	I	shall	plan	your	instruction	for	you,	if	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">please,	 and	 send	 you	 to	 the	 primitives	 first—the	 mighty	 ones	 who	 laid	 the foundations.	 I	 lived	 five	 years	 at	 Siena—for	 love	 of	 the	 beginnings;	 and	 you must	 also	 learn	 to	 love	 and	 reverence	 the	 beginnings,	 if	 you	 would	 understand that	light	in	the	darkness	men	call	the	Renaissance." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	broke	from	Mary	presently,	strove	to	interest	Sir	Walter,	and	succeeded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	benevolent	autocracy	is	the	ideal	government,	my	friend—the	ideal	of	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">supreme	thinkers—a	Machiavelli,	a	Nietzsche,	a	Stendhal,	a	Gobineau.	Liberty</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	equality	are	terms	mutually	destructive,	they	cannot	exist	together;	for,	given</p>
<p class="calibre1">liberty,	 the	 strong	 instantly	 look	 to	 it	 that	 equality	 shall	 perish.	 And	 rightly	 so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Equality	is	a	war	cry	for	fools—a	negation	of	nature,	an	abortion.	The	very	ants</p>
<p class="calibre1">know	better.	Doubtless	you	view	with	considerable	distrust	the	growing	spirit	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">democracy,	or	what	is	called	by	that	name?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	do,"	admitted	Sir	Walter. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a>"Your	 monarch	 and	 mine	 are	 a	 little	 bitten	 by	 this	 tarantula.	 I	 am	 concerned for	them.	We	must	not	pander	to	the	mob's	leaders,	for	they	are	not,	and	never</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	been,	the	many-headed	thing	itself.	They,	not	the	mob,	are	'out	to	kill,'	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	say.	But	that	State	will	soon	perish	that	thinks	to	prosper	under	the	rule	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 proletariat.	 Such	 a	 constitution	 would	 be	 opposed	 to	 natural	 law	 and, therefore,	 contain	 the	 seeds	 of	 its	 own	 dissolution.	 And	 its	 death	 would	 be inconceivably	 horrible;	 for	 the	 death	 of	 huge,	 coarse	 organisms	 is	 always</p>
<p class="calibre1">horrible.	Only	distinguished	creatures	are	beautiful	in	death,	or	know	how	to	die</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	gentlemen." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who	are	on	your	side	to-day,	signor?"	asked	Henry	Lennox. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"More	than	I	know,	I	hope.	Gobineau	is	my	lighthouse	in	the	storm.	You	must</p>
<p class="calibre1">read	 him,	 if	 you	 have	 not	 done	 so.	 He	 was	 the	 incarnate	 spirit	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Renaissance.	He	radiated	from	his	bosom	its	effulgence	and	shot	it	forth,	like	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">light	of	a	pharos	over	dark	waters;	he,	best	of	all	men,	understood	it,	and,	most</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	all	men,	mourned	to	see	its	bright	hope	and	glory	perish	out	of	the	earth	under</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 unconquerable	 superstition	 of	 mankind	 and	 the	 lamentable	 infliction	 of	 the Jewish	 race.	 Alas!	 The	 Jews	 have	 destroyed	 many	 other	 things	 besides	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Saviour	of	us	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	found	the	Renaissance	to	be	the	favorite	theme	of	Signor	Mannetti.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">returned	again	and	again	to	it,	and	it	was	typical	of	him	that	he	could	combine</p>
<p class="calibre1">assurances	of	being	a	devout	Catholic	with	sentiments	purely	pagan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Christianity	 has	 operated	 in	 the	 making	 of	 many	 slaves	 and	 charlatans,"	 he said.	 "One	 mourns	 the	 fact,	 but	 must	 be	 honest.	 It	 has	 too	 often	 scourged	 the only	really	precious	members	of	society	from	the	temple	of	life.	It	has	cast	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">brave	 and	 clean	 and	 virile	 into	 outer	 darkness,	 and	 exalted	 the	 staple	 of humanity,	 which	 is	 never	 brave,	 or	 virile,	 and	 seldom	 really	 clean.	 A	 hideous wave	 submerges	 everything	 that	 matters.	 The	 proud,	 the	 beautiful—the	 only</p>
<p class="calibre1">beings	that	justify	the	existence	of	mankind—will	soon	be	on	the	hills	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hawks	and	leopards,	and	hunted	like	them—outcast,	pariah,	unwanted,	hated." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 spirit	 of	 christianity	 is	 socialistic,	 I	 fear,"	 said	 Sir	 Walter.	 "It	 is	 one	 of those	things	I	do	not	pretend	to	understand,	but	the	modern	clergy	speak	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">clear	voice	on	the	subject." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	your	clergy	indeed	speak	with	a	clear	voice?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	do;	and	we	must,	of	course,	listen.	Truth	is	apt	to	be	painful.	And	how</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	 we	 reconcile	 our	 aristocratic	 instincts	 with	 our	 faith?	 I	 ask	 for	 information and	 you	 will	 forgive	 the	 personality.	 I	 find	 myself	 in	 almost	 entire	 agreement with	your	noble	sentiments.	But,	as	a	good	Christian,	ought	I	to	be	so?	How	do</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>you	stand	with	the	one	true	faith	in	your	heart	and	these	opinions	in	your	head, signor?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	old	man	twinkled	and	a	boyish	smile	lighted	his	aged	countenance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	good	question—a	shrewd	thrust,	Sir	Walter.	There	can	be	only	one	answer</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	that,	my	friend.	With	God	all	things	are	possible." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	laughed;	his	uncle	was	puzzled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	 think	 that	 is	 no	 answer,"	 continued	 the	 Italian.	 "But	 reason	 also	 must have	a	place	in	the	sun,	though	we	have	to	hide	it	in	our	pocket	sometimes.	So</p>
<p class="calibre1">many	 great	 men	 would	 not	 extinguish	 their	 light—and	 had	 it	 extinguished	 for them.	A	difficult	subject.	Let	us	continue	to	think	in	compartments.	It	is	safer	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 you	 are	 over	 eighty	 years	 old,	 you	 love	 safety.	 But	 I	 love	 joy	 and	 romance also,	 and	 is	 not	 religion	 almost	 the	 only	 joy	 and	 romance	 left	 to	 us?	 It	 is affirmation	 remember,	 not	 negation,	 that	 makes	 the	 world	 go	 round!	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">'intellectuals'	forget	that,	and	they	are	sterile	accordingly." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Signor	Mannetti's	wits	 were	something	too	 nimble	for	his	 hearers.	He	talked</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 talked—about	 everything	 but	 the	 matter	 in	 their	 minds—until	 half-past	 ten o'clock,	when	his	man	came	after	him.	Thereupon	he	rose,	like	an	obedient	child, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	wished	them	"Good-night." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Stephano	 is	 my	 guardian	 angel,"	 he	 said—"a	 being	 of	 painful	 punctuality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	he	adds	years	to	my	life.	He	forgets	nothing.	I	wish	you	a	kind	farewell	until</p>
<p class="calibre1">to-morrow	and	offer	grateful	thanks	for	your	welcome.	I	breakfast	in	my	room,	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	 please,	 and	 shall	 be	 ready	 at	 eleven	 o'clock	 to	 put	 myself	 at	 your	 service. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	you	will	be	so	gracious	as	to	answer	me	some	questions,	and	I	shall,	please</p>
<p class="calibre1">God,	try	to	help	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	XI.	PRINCE	DJEM</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 master	 of	 Chadlands	 was	 both	 drawn	 and	 repelled	 by	 his	 guest.	 Signor Mannetti	 revealed	 a	 type	 of	 mind	 entirely	 beyond	 the	 other's	 experience,	 and while	he	often	uttered	sentiments	with	which	Sir	Walter	found	himself	in	cordial</p>
<p class="calibre1">agreement,	 he	 also	 committed	 himself	 to	 a	 great	 many	 opinions	 that	 surprised and	occasionally	shocked	 the	listener.	Sir	 Walter	was	also	 conscious	that	many</p>
<p class="calibre1">words	 uttered	 flew	 above	 his	 understanding.	 The	 old	 Italian	 could	 juggle	 with English	almost	as	perfectly	as	he	was	able	to	do	with	his	own	language.	He	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 country's	 mastery	 of	 the	 phrase,	 the	 ironies,	 the	 double	 meanings,	 half malicious,	half	humorous,	the	outlook	on	humanity	that	delights	to	surprise—the</p>
<p class="calibre1">compliment	that,	on	closer	examination,	proves	really	to	be	the	reverse.	Mary's</p>
<p class="calibre1">father	voiced	his	emotions	when	the	visitor	had	gone	to	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	 it	 didn't	 seem	 impossible,"	 he	 told	 Henry,	 "I	 could	 almost	 imagine	 that Signor	Mannetti	was	trying	to	pull	my	leg	sometimes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	tries,	and	succeeds,"	answered	young	Lennox.	"He	is	built	that	way.	His mind	 is	 as	 agile	 as	 a	 monkey,	 despite	 his	 age.	 He's	 a	 sly	 old	 bird;	 his	 thoughts move	 a	 thousand	 times	 faster	 than	 ours,	 and	 they're	 a	 thousand	 times	 more subtle." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	he's	very	fascinating,"	declared	Mary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	a	gentleman,"	answered	Henry—"an	Italian	gentleman.	They're	different from	us	in	their	ideas	of	good	form,	that's	all.	Good	form	is	largely	a	matter	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">geography—like	most	other	manners	and	customs." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	believe	in	him,	anyway." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	 do	 I,	 Mary.	 I	 don't	 think	 he	 would	 ever	 have	 put	 himself	 to	 such extraordinary	trouble	if	he	hadn't	felt	pretty	hopeful." </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Sir	Walter	doubted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	old	and	his	mind	plays	him	tricks	sometimes.	No	doubt	he's	immensely</p>
<p class="calibre1">clever;	but	his	cleverness	belongs	to	the	past.	He	has	not	moved	with	the	times</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	more	than	I	have." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"His	eye	flashes	still,	and	you	know	he	has	claws,	but,	like	a	dear	old	Persian cat,	he	would	never	dream	of	using	them." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	think	he	would,"	answered	her	cousin.	"He	might	spring	on	anybody—from behind." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>"He	is,	at	any	rate,	too	old	to	understand	democracy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	understands	it	only	too	well,"	replied	Sir	Walter.	"Like	myself,	he	knows that	 democracy	 is	 only	 autocracy	 turned	 inside	 out.	 Human	 nature	 isn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">constructed	to	bear	any	such	ideal.	It	might	suit	sheep	and	oxen—not	men." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	is	an	aristocrat,	a	survival,	proud	as	a	peacock	under	his	humility,	as	kind-hearted	as	you	are	yourself,	father." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	rather	doubt	his	kindness	of	heart,"	said	Henry.	"Latins	are	not	kind.	But	I don't	doubt	his	cleverness.	One	must	be	on	one's	guard	against	first	impressions, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	 no	 one	 mustn't,	 when	 they're	 so	 pleasant.	 There	 is	 nothing	 small	 or peddling	about	him.	It	was	angelic	of	such	an	old	man	to	take	so	much	trouble." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	Lennox	reminded	them	of	practical	considerations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	first	thing	is	to	get	the	room	opened	for	him.	He	is	going	to	see	Uncle</p>
<p class="calibre1">Walter	at	eleven	o'clock,	and	he'll	want	to	visit	the	Grey	Room	afterwards.	If	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	Chubb	and	a	man	or	two	from	the	village	the	first	thing	in	the	morning,	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	help	Caunter	to	open	the	room	and	have	it	ready	for	him	after	lunch." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	 Walter	 rang	 and	 directed	 that	 workmen	 should	 be	 sent	 for	 at	 the	 earliest hour	next	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	feel	doubtful	as	to	what	the	authorities	would	say,	however,"	he	told	Henry, when	his	orders	had	been	taken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	can	they	say,	but	be	well	pleased	if	the	infernal	thing	is	cleared	up?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	is	too	good	to	be	true." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	I	should	think,	but	I	share	Mary's	optimism.	I	honestly	believe	that	Signor Mannetti	 knows	 a	 great	 deal	 more	 about	 the	 Grey	 Room	 than	 he	 has	 let	 us imagine." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	can	he	possibly	do	that?"	asked	his	uncle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Time	 will	 show;	 but	 I'm	 going	 to	 back	 him."	 At	 eleven	 o'clock	 on	 the following	 morning	 the	 visitor	 appeared.	 He	 walked	 with	 a	 gold-headed,	 ebony cane	 and	 dressed	 in	 a	 fashion	 of	 earlier	 days.	 He	 was	 alert	 and	 keen;	 his	 mind had	 no	 difficulty	 in	 concentrating	 on	 his	 subject.	 It	 appeared	 that	 he	 had	 all particulars	 at	 his	 fingers'	 ends,	 and	 he	 went	 back	 into	 the	 history	 of	 the	 Grey Room	as	far	as	Sir	Walter	was	able	to	take	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	 are	 dealing	 with	 five	 victims	 to	 our	 certain	 knowledge,"	 he	 said,	 "for there	is	very	little	doubt	that	all	must	have	suffered	the	same	death	and	under	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same	circumstances." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a>"Four	victims,	signor." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	forget	your	aged	relative—the	lady	who	came	to	spend	Christmas	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	 father,	 when	 you	 were	 a	 boy,	 and	 was	 found	 dead	 on	 the	 floor.	 Colonel Vane,	however,	recollected	her,	because	you	had	mentioned	her	when	telling	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">story	of	Mrs.	Forrester—Nurse	Forrester." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	never	associated	my	aged	aunt	with	subsequent	tragedies—nobody	did." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nevertheless,	it	was	not	old	age	and	a	good	dinner	that	ended	her	life.	She, </p>
<p class="calibre1">too,	perished	by	an	assassin." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	still	speak	of	crime." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	I	am	not	mistaken,	then	'crime'	is	the	only	word." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But,	 forgive	 me,	 is	 it	 imaginable	 that	 the	 same	 criminal	 could	 destroy	 three men	last	year	and	kill	an	old	woman	more	than	sixty	years	ago?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Quite	possible.	You	do	not	see?	Then	I	hope	to	have	the	privilege	of	showing</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	presently." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	would	seem,	then,	that	the	malignant	thing	is	really	undying—as	poor	May</p>
<p class="calibre1">believed—a	 conscious	 being	 hidden	 there,	 but	 beyond	 our	 sight	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowledge?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	no,	my	friend.	Let	me	be	frank.	I	have	no	theory	that	embraces	either	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">good	or	evil	spirit.	Believe	me,	there	are	fewer	things	in	heaven	and	earth	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	 dreamed	 of	 in	 our	 philosophy.	 Man	 has	 burdened	 his	 brain	 with	 an	 infinite deal	 of	 rubbish	 of	 his	 own	 manufacture.	 Much	 of	 his	 principle	 and	 practice	 is built	on	myths	and	dreams.	He	is	a	credulous	creature,	and	insanely	tenacious	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">tradition;	but	I	say	to	you,	suspect	tradition	at	every	turn,	and	the	more	ancient</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	tradition,	the	more	mistrust	it.	We	harbor	a	great	deal	too	much	of	the	savage</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	in	us—we	still	carry	about	far	more	of	his	mental	lumber	and	nonsense	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	imagine.	Intellect	should	simplify	rather	than	complicate,	and	those	to	come</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	look	back	with	pity	to	see	this	generation,	like	flies,	entangled	in	the	webs</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 thought	 their	 rude	 forefathers	 spun.	 But	 the	 eternal	 verities	 are	 few;	 a	 child could	count	them.	We	are,	however,	a	great	deal	too	fond	of	believing	what	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">ancestors	 believed.	 Alas,	 nobody	 sins	 more	 in	 this	 respect	 than	 I.	 Let	 us,	 then, throw	overboard	the	supernatural,	once	and	for	all,	so	far	as	the	Grey	Room	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">concerned.	No	ghost	haunts	it;	no	succubus	or	succuba	is	hidden	there,	to	harry</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	life	out	of	good	men	and	women." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	is	strange	that	you	should	take	almost	the	identical	line	of	thought	that	poor Peter	Hardcastle	took.	I	hope	to	God	you	are	right!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	far	I	am	most	certainly	in	the	right.	We	can	leave	the	other	world	out	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a>our	calculations." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 asked	 various	 questions,	 many	 of	 which	 did	 not	 appear	 to	 bear	 on	 the subject,	 but	 he	 made	 no	 suggestions	 as	 yet,	 and	 advanced	 no	 theories.	 He suspected	that	Peter	Hardcastle	might	have	arrived	at	a	conclusion	had	not	death</p>
<p class="calibre1">cut	short	his	inquiry.	From	time	to	time	he	lifted	his	hand	gently	for	silence,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">permitted	a	reply	to	penetrate	his	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 think	 very	 slowly	 about	 new	 things	 now,"	 he	 said.	 "An	 idea	 must	 sink	 in gradually	 and	 find	 its	 place.	 That	 is	 the	 worst	 of	 new	 ideas.	 There	 is	 so	 little room	for	them	when	you	are	eighty.	The	old	and	settled	opinions	fill	the	space, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	are	jealous	and	resent	newcomers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	 Walter	 explained	 to	 him	 presently	 that	 the	 room	 was	 being	 opened,	 and would	 be	 ready	 after	 luncheon.	 Whereupon	 he	 expressed	 concern	 for	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">workers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let	them	have	a	care,"	he	said,	"for,	if	I	am	right,	the	danger	is	still	present. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let	them	work	with	despatch,	and	not	loiter	about." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No	 harm	 has	 ever	 undertaken	 more	 than	 one,	 when	 in	 the	 room	 alone.	 The detectives	saw	and	felt	nothing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nevertheless,	 the	 assassin	 was	 quite	 equal	 to	 smudging	 out	 the	 detectives, believe	me,	Sir	Walter." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	day	was	fine,	and	Signor	Mannetti	expressed	a	wish	to	take	the	air.	They</p>
<p class="calibre1">walked	 on	 the	 terrace	 presently,	 and	 Mary	 joined	 them.	 He	 asked	 for	 her	 arm, and	she	gave	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prince	padded	beside	her,	and	the	visitor	declared	interest	in	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Like	myself,	your	dog	is	on	the	verge	of	better	things,"	he	said.	"He	will	do good	deeds	in	the	happy	hunting	grounds,	be	sure." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	told	him	the	feats	of	Prince,	and	he	appeared	to	be	interested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nevertheless,	the	faithful	creature	ought	to	die	now.	He	is	blind	and	paralysis is	crippling	his	hinder	parts." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter	patted	the	head	of	his	ancient	favorite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	dies	on	Friday,"	he	said.	"The	vet	will	come	then.	I	assure	you	the	thought gives	me	very	genuine	pain." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	 has	 earned	 euthanasia,	 surely.	 What	 is	 that	 fine	 tree	 with	 great	 white flowers?	I	have	seen	the	like	before,	but	am	sadly	ignorant	of	horticulture." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	tulip-tree,"	said	Mary.	"It's	supposed	to	be	the	finest	in	Devonshire." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	beautiful	object.	But	all	is	beautiful	here.	An	English	spring	can	be	divine. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>I	shall	ask	you	to	drive	me	to	primroses	presently.	Those	are	azaleas—that	bank of	living	fire—superb!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	praised	the	scene,	and	spoke	about	the	formal	gardens	of	Italy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	when	luncheon	was	finished	and	he	had	smoked	a	couple	of	cigarettes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Signor	Mannetti	rose,	bowed	to	Sir	Walter,	and	said:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now,	if	you	please." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	accompanied	and	watched	him	silently,	while	his	eyes	wandered	round</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Grey	Room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	place	was	unchanged,	and	the	dancing	cherubs	on	the	great	chairs	seemed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	welcome	daylight	after	their	long	darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 visitor	 wandered	 slowly	 from	 end	 to	 end	 of	 the	 chamber,	 nodded	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself,	 and	 became	 animated.	 Then	 he	 checked	 his	 gathering	 excitement,	 and presently	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	think	I	am	going	to	help	you,	Sir	Walter,"	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	is	great	and	good	news,	signor." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 the	 old	 man	 became	 inconsequent,	 and	 turned	 from	 the	 room	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">contents.	If,	indeed,	he	had	found	a	clue,	he	appeared	in	no	haste	to	pursue	it.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">entered	 now	 upon	 a	 disquisition	 concerning	 the	 furniture,	 and	 they	 listened patiently,	 for	 he	 had	 showed	 that	 any	 interruption	 troubled	 him.	 But	 it	 seemed that	he	enjoyed	putting	a	strain	upon	their	impatience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Beautiful	 pieces,"	 he	 said,	 "but	 not	 Spanish,	 as	 you	 led	 me	 to	 suppose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Spanish	 chestnut	 wood,	 but	 nothing	 else	 Spanish	 about	 them.	 They	 are	 of	 the Italian	Renaissance,	and	it	is	most	seemly	that	Italian	craftsmanship	of	such	high</p>
<p class="calibre1">order	 should	 repose	 here,	 under	 an	 Italian	 ceiling.	 Strange	 to	 say,	 my	 sleeping apartment	at	Rome	closely	resembles	this	room.	I	live	in	a	villa	that	dates	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 fifteenth	 century,	 and	 belonged	 to	 the	 Colonna.	 My	 chests	 are	 more	 superb than	 these;	 but	 your	 suite—the	 bed	 and	 chairs—I	 confess	 are	 better	 than	 mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 is,	 however,	 a	 reason	 for	 that.	 Let	 us	 examine	 them	 for	 the	 sake	 of	 Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">May.	Are	these	carved	chairs,	with	their	reliefs	of	dancing	putti,	familiar	to	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">—the	figures,	I	mean?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary	shook	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	 it	 is	 certain	 that	 in	 your	 Italian	 wanderings	 you	 did	 not	 go	 to	 Prato. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These	 groups	 of	 children	 dancing	 and	 blowing	 horns	 are	 very	 cleverly	 copied from	Donatello's	famous	pulpit	in	the	duomo.	The	design	is	carried	on	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">chairs	to	the	footboard	of	the	bed;	but	in	their	midst	upon	the	footboard	is	let	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	 oval,	 easel-picture,	 painted	 on	 wood.	 It	 is	 faded,	 and	 the	 garlands	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a>withered	in	so	many	hundred	years,	as	well	they	might;	but	I	can	feel	the	dead color	quite	well,	and	I	also	know	who	painted	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	it	possible,	signor—this	faint	ghost	of	a	picture?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	exists	no	doubt	at	all.	You	see	a	little	Pinturicchio.	Note	the	gay	bands of	variegated	patterns,	the	arabesques	and	fruits.	Their	hues	have	vanished,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	forms	and	certain	mannerisms	of	the	master	are	unmistakable.	These	dainty</p>
<p class="calibre1">decorations	 were	 the	 sign	 manual	 of	 such	 quattrocento	 painters	 as	 Gozzoli	 and Pinturicchio;	 and	 to	 these	 men	 he,	 for	 whom	 these	 works	 of	 art	 were	 created, assigned	 the	 painting	 and	 adornment	 of	 the	 Vatican.	 We	 will	 come	 to	 him</p>
<p class="calibre1">directly.	 It	 was	 for	 Michelangelo	 to	 make	 the	 creations	 of	 these	 artists	 mere colored	 bubbles	 and	 froth,	 when	 seen	 against	 the	 immensity	 and	 intellectual grandeur	 of	 his	 future	 masterpieces	 in	 the	 Sistine.	 But	 that	 was	 afterwards.	 We are	concerned	with	the	Pope	for	whom	these	chairs	and	this	bed	were	made.	Yes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a	Pope,	my	friends—no	less	a	personage	than	Alexander	VI.!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	waited,	like	a	skilled	actor,	for	the	tremendous	sensation	he	expected	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">deserved.	 But	 it	 did	 not	 come.	 Unhappily	 for	 Signor	 Mannetti's	 great	 moment, his	words	conveyed	no	particular	impression	to	anybody. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter	asked	politely:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	was	he	a	good,	or	a	bad	Pope?	I	fear	many	of	those	gentlemen	had	little</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	their	credit." </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	the	signor	felt	the	failure	of	his	great	climax.	At	first	he	regretted	it,	and	a wave	 of	 annoyance,	 even	 contempt,	 passed	 unseen	 through	 his	 mind;	 then	 he was	glad	that	the	secret	should	be	hidden	for	another	four-and-twenty	hours,	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">gain	 immensely	 in	 dramatic	 sensation	 by	 delay.	 Already	 he	 was	 planning	 the future,	and	designing	wonderful	histrionics.	He	could	not	be	positive	that	he	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">right;	though	now	the	old	man	felt	very	little	doubt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	did	not	answer	Sir	Walter's	question,	but	asked	one	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	detectives	examined	this	apartment	with	meticulous	care,	you	say?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	did	indeed." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	yet	what	can	care	and	zeal	do;	what	can	the	most	conscientious	student</p>
<p class="calibre1">achieve	if	his	activities	are	confounded	by	ignorance?	The	amazing	thing	to	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	that	nobody	should	have	had	the	necessary	information	to	lead	them	at	least	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	right	direction.	And	yet	I	run	on	too	fast.	After	all,	who	shall	be	blamed,	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 is,	 of	 course,	 the	 Grey	 Room	 and	 nothing	 but	 the	 Grey	 Room	 we	 are</p>
<p class="calibre1">concerned	with.	Am	I	right?	The	Grey	Room	has	the	evil	fame?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Certainly	it	has." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>"And	yet	a	little	knowledge	of	a	few	peculiar	facts—a	pinch	of	history—yet, once	again,	who	shall	be	blamed?	Who	can	be	fairly	asked	to	possess	that	pinch</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	history	which	means	so	much	in	this	room?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	could	history	have	helped	us,	signor?"	asked	Henry	Lennox. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 shall	 tell	 you.	 But	 history	 is	 always	 helpful.	 There	 is	 history	 everywhere around	 us—not	 only	 here,	 but	 in	 every	 other	 department	 of	 this	 noble	 house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Take	these	chairs.	By	the	accident	of	training,	I	read	in	them	a	whole	chapter	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 beginnings	 of	 the	 Renaissance;	 to	 you	 they	 are	 only	 old	 furniture.	 You thought	 them	 Spanish	 because	 they	 were	 bought	 in	 Spain—at	 Valencia,	 as	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter	of	fact.	You	did	not	know	that,	Sir	Walter;	but	your	grandfather	purchased</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	there—to	the	despair	and	envy	of	another	collector.	Yes,	these	chairs	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">speaking	faces	to	me,	just	as	the	ceiling	over	them	has	a	speaking	face	also.	It, </p>
<p class="calibre1">too,	is	copied.	History,	in	fact,	breathes	its	very	essence	in	this	home.	If	I	knew</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	history	than	I	do,	then	other	beautiful	things	would	talk	to	me	as	freely	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	chairs—and	as	freely	as	the	trophies	of	the	chase	and	the	tiger	skins	below</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	 doubt	 talk	 to	 Sir	 Walter.	 But	 are	 we	 not	 all	 historical—men,	 women,	 even children?	To	exist	is	to	take	your	place	in	history,	though,	as	in	my	case,	the	fact will	not	be	recorded	save	in	the	'Chronicles'	of	the	everlasting.	Yes,	I	am	ancient</p>
<p class="calibre1">history	 now,	 and	 go	 far	 back,	 before	 Italy	 was	 a	 united	 kingdom.	 Much</p>
<p class="calibre1">entertaining	information	will	be	lost	for	ever	when	I	die.	Believe	me,	while	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">new	generation	is	crying	forth	the	new	knowledge	and	glorying	in	its	genius,	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	old	guard	are	sinking	into	our	graves	and	taking	the	old	knowledge	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">us.	 Yet	 they	 only	 rediscover	 for	 themselves	 what	 we	 know.	 Human	 life	 is	 the snake	 with	 its	 tail	 in	 its	 mouth—Nietzsche's	 eternal	 recurrence	 and	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">commonplaces	of	our	forefathers	are	echoed	on	the	lips	of	our	children	as	great</p>
<p class="calibre1">discoveries." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	Lennox	ventured	to	bring	him	back	to	the	point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	 knowledge—what	 particular	 branch	 of	 information	 should	 a	 man</p>
<p class="calibre1">possess,	signor,	to	find	out	what	you	have	found?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Merely	an	adornment,	my	young	friend,	a	side	branch	of	withered	learning, </p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 cultivated,	 I	 fear,	 by	 your	 Scotland	 Yard.	 Yet	 I	 have	 known	 country</p>
<p class="calibre1">gentlemen	 to	 be	 skilled	 in	 it.	 The	 practice	 of	 heraldry.	 I	 marked	 your	 arms	 on your	 Italian	 gates.	 I	 must	 look	 at	 those	 gates	 again—they	 are	 not	 very	 good,	 I fear.	But	the	arms—a	chevron	between	three	lions—a	fine	coat,	yet	probably	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	ancient	as	the	gates." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	was	such	a	thing	as	bothered	me	in	Florence,"	said	Sir	Walter.	"I'd	seen	it before	somewhere,	but	where	I	know	not—a	bull's	head	of	gold	on	a	red	field." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>Signor	Mannetti	started	and	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ha-ha!	We	will	come	to	the	golden	bull	presently,	Sir	Walter.	You	shall	meet</p>
<p class="calibre1">him,	I	promise	you!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he	broke	off	and	patted	his	forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	I	go	too	quickly—far	too	quickly	indeed.	I	must	rest	my	poor	brain	now, </p>
<p class="calibre1">or	it	will	rattle	in	my	head	like	a	dry	walnut.	When	it	begins	to	rattle,	I	know	that I	have	done	enough	for	the	present.	May	I	walk	in	the	garden	again—not	alone, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	with	your	companionship?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	course,	unless	you	would	like	to	retire	and	rest	for	a	while." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Presently	 I	 shall	 do	 so.	 And	 please	 permit	 nobody	 to	 enter	 the	 Grey	 Room but	myself.	Not	a	soul	must	go	or	come	without	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	 still	 believe	 the	 peril	 is	 material	 then—an	 active,	 physical	 thing, controlled	by	a	conscious	human	intelligence?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	I	am	right,	it	certainly	is	active	enough." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 went	 into	 the	 garden,	 and	 Signor	 Mannetti,	 finding	 a	 snug	 seat	 in	 the sun,	decided	to	stop	there.	Henry	and	his	uncle	exchanged	glances,	and	the	latter</p>
<p class="calibre1">found	his	faith	weakening,	for	the	Italian's	mind	appeared	to	wander.	He	became</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	and	more	irrelevant,	as	it	seemed.	He	spoke	again	of	the	old	dog	who	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	his	master's	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Euthanasia	 for	 the	 aged.	 Why	 not?	 For	 that	 matter,	 I	 have	 considered	 it	 for myself	in	dark	moments.	Have	you	ever	wondered	why	we	destroy	our	pets,	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">love	of	them,	yet	suffer	our	fellow	creatures	to	exist	and	endure	to	the	very	dregs</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nature's	 most	 fiendish	 methods	 of	 dissolution?	 Again	 one	 of	 those	 terrible problems	where	mercy	and	religion	cannot	see	eye	to	eye." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 uttered	 appropriate	 sentiments,	 and	 again	 the	 old	 man	 changed	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">subject	and	broke	new	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	was	a	prince—not	your	old	dog—but	a	royal	lad	of	the	East—Prince</p>
<p class="calibre1">Djem,	the	brother	of	the	Sultan	Bajazet.	Do	you	know	that	story?	Possibly	not—</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	is	unimportant	enough,	and	to	this	day	the	sequel	of	the	incident	is	buried	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">mystery	 as	 profound	 as	 that	 of	 the	 Grey	 Room.	 Our	 later	 historians	 whitewash Alexander	VI.	concerning	the	matter	of	Prince	Djem;	but	then	it	is	so	much	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">habit	 of	 later	 historians	 to	 whitewash	 everybody.	 A	 noble	 quality	 in	 human nature	 perhaps—to	 try	 and	 see	 the	 best,	 even	 while	 one	 can	 only	 do	 so	 by ignoring	the	worst.	Certainly,	as	your	poet	says,	'Distance	makes	the	heart	grow</p>
<p class="calibre1">fonder';	or,	at	any	rate,	softer.	There	is	a	tendency	to	side	with	the	angels	where</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>we	 are	 dealing	 with	 historic	 dead.	 Nero,	 Caligula,	 Calvin,	 Alva,	 Napoleon, Torquemada—all	 these	 monsters	 and	 portents,	 and	 a	 thousand	 such	 blood-bespattered	 figures	 are	 growing	 whiter	 as	 they	 grow	 fainter.	 They	 will	 have wings	and	haloes	presently.	Yet	not	for	me.	I	am	a	good	hater,	my	friends.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">Prince	Djem—I	wander	so.	You	should	be	more	severe	with	me	and	keep	me	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	point.	Sultan	Bajazet	wanted	his	younger	brother	out	of	the	way,	and	he	paid</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Papacy	forty	thousand	ducats	a	year	to	keep	the	young	fellow	a	prisoner	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Italy.	 It	 was	 a	 gilded	 captivity	 and	 doubtless	 the	 dissolute	 Oriental	 enjoyed himself	 quite	 as	 well	 at	 Rome	 as	 he	 would	 have	 done	 in	 Constantinople.	 But after	 Alexander	 had	 achieved	 the	 triple	 tiara,	 Bajazet	 refused	 to	 pay	 his	 forty thousand	 ducats	 any	 longer.	 The	 Pope,	 therefore,	 wrote	 strongly	 to	 the	 Sultan, telling	him	that	the	King	of	France	designed	to	seize	Prince	Djem	and	go	to	war</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	his	account	against	the	Turks.	This	does	not	weary	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	indeed,"	declared	Mary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Alexander	added,	that	to	enable	him	to	resist	the	French	and	spare	Bajazet's</p>
<p class="calibre1">realms	 the	 threatened	 invasion,	 a	 sum	 of	 forty	 thousand	 ducats	 must	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">immediately	 forthcoming.	 The	 Sultan,	 doubtless	 appalled	 by	 such	 a	 threat, </p>
<p class="calibre1">despatched	 the	 money	 with	 a	 private	 letter.	 He	 was	 as	 great	 a	 diplomat	 as	 the Pope	 himself,	 and	 saw	 a	 way	 to	 evade	 this	 gigantic	 annual	 impost	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1">compounding	 on	 the	 death	 of	 Djem.	 Unfortunately	 for	 him,	 however,	 both	 the papal	 envoy	 and	 Bajazet's	 own	 messenger	 were	 captured	 upon	 their	 return</p>
<p class="calibre1">journey	 by	 the	 brother	 of	 Cardinal	 della	 Rovere—Alexander's	 bitterest	 enemy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus	 the	 contents	 of	 the	 secret	 letter	 became	 known,	 and	 the	 Christian	 world heard	 with	 horror	 how	 Bajazet	 had	 offered	 the	 occupant	 of	 St.	 Peter's	 throne three	hundred	thousand	ducats	to	assassinate	Prince	Djem! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Time	 passed,	 and	 the	 Pope	 triumphed	 over	 his	 enemies.	 He	 prepared	 to abandon	 the	 person	 of	 the	 young	 Turk	 to	 Charles	 of	 France,	 and	 effectively checkmated	 the	 formidable	 Rovere	 for	 a	 season.	 But	 then,	 as	 we	 know,	 Prince Djem	suddenly	perished,	and	while	latest	writers	declare	that	he	actually	reached</p>
<p class="calibre1">France,	 only	 to	 die	 there,	 ruined	 by	 his	 own	 debaucheries,	 I,	 for	 one,	 have	 not accepted	that	story.	He	never	reached	France,	my	friends,	for	be	sure	Alexander</p>
<p class="calibre1">VI.	was	not	the	man	to	let	any	human	life	stand	between	his	treasury	and	three</p>
<p class="calibre1">hundred	thousand	ducats." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Signor	 Mannetti	 preserved	 silence	 for	 a	 time,	 then	 he	 returned	 in	 very</p>
<p class="calibre1">surprising	fashion	to	the	subject	that	had	brought	him	to	Chadlands.	He	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">reflecting	and	now	proceeded	with	his	thoughts	aloud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	 must,	 however,	 restrain	 your	 natural	 impatience	 a	 little	 longer,	 until another	 night	 has	 passed.	 I	 will,	 if	 you	 please,	 myself	 spend	 some	 hours	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a>Grey	Room	after	dark,	and	learn	what	the	medieval	spirits	have	to	tell	me.	Shall I	see	the	wraith	of	Prince	Djem,	think	you?	Or	the	ghost	of	Pinturicchio	hovering</p>
<p class="calibre1">round	 his	 little	 picture?	 Or	 those	 bygone,	 cunning	 workers	 in	 plaster	 who	 built the	 ceiling?	 They	 will	 at	 least	 talk	 the	 language	 of	 Tuscany,	 and	 I	 shall	 be	 at home	among	them." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter	protested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That,	indeed,	is	the	last	thing	I	could	permit,	signor,"	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	 is	 the	 first	 thing	 that	 must	 happen,	 nevertheless,"	 replied	 the	 old gentleman	calmly.	"You	need	not	fear	for	me,	Sir	Walter.	I	jest	about	the	spirits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	are	no	spirits	in	the	Grey	Room,	or,	if	there	are,	they	are	not	such	as	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">quarrel	 with	 you,	 or	 me.	 There	 is,	 however,	 something	 much	 worse	 than	 any spirit	lurking	in	the	heart	of	your	house—a	potent,	sleepless,	fiendish	thing;	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">far	 from	 wondering	 at	 all	 that	 has	 happened,	 I	 only	 marvel	 that	 worse	 did	 not befall.	But	I	have	the	magic	talisman,	the	'open	sesame.'	I	am	safe	enough	even</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	I	am	mistaken.	Though	my	fires	are	burning	low,	it	will	take	more	than	your</p>
<p class="calibre1">Grey	 Room	 to	 extinguish	 them.	 I	 hold	 the	 clue	 of	 the	 labyrinth,	 and	 shall	 pass safely	in	and	out	again.	To-morrow	I	can	tell	you	if	I	am	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	confess	that	any	such	plan	is	most	disagreeable	to	me.	I	have	been	specially directed	by	the	authorities	to	allow	no	man	to	make	further	experiments	alone." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vergilio	 Mannetti	 showed	 a	 trace	 of	 testiness.	 "Forgive	 me,	 but	 your	 mind moves	without	its	usual	agility,	my	friend.	Have	I	not	told	you	everything?	What</p>
<p class="calibre1">matters	 Scotland	 Yard,	 seeing	 that	 it	 is	 entirely	 in	 the	 dark,	 while	 I	 have	 the light?	 Let	 them	 hear	 that	 they	 are	 bats	 and	 owls,	 and	 that	 one	 old	 man	 has outwitted	the	pack	of	them!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	have,	as	you	say,	told	us	much,	my	dear	signor,	and	much	that	you	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	 is	 deeply	 interesting.	 In	 your	 mind	 it	 may	 be	 that	 these	 various	 facts	 are related,	and	bring	you	to	some	sort	of	conclusion	bearing	on	the	Grey	Room;	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 us	 it	 is	 not	 so.	 These	 statements	 leave	 us	 where	 they	 find	 us;	 they	 hang	 on nothing,	 not	 even	 upon	 one	 another	 in	 our	 ears.	 I	 speak	 plainly,	 since	 this	 is	 a matter	for	plain	speaking.	It	is	natural	that	you	should	not	feel	as	we	feel;	but	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">need	not	remind	you	that	what	to	you	is	merely	an	extraordinary	mystery,	to	us	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	 more.	 You	 have	 imagination,	 however,	 far	 more	 than	 I	 have,	 and	 can</p>
<p class="calibre1">guess,	 without	 being	 told,	 the	 awful	 suffering	 the	 past	 has	 brought	 to	 my daughter	and	myself." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Our	slow	English	brains	cannot	flash	our	thoughts	along	so	quickly	as	yours, </p>
<p class="calibre1">signor,"	said	Mary.	"It	is	stupid	of	us,	but—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 stand	 corrected,"	 answered	 the	 other	 instantly.	 He	 rose	 from	 his	 seat,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a>bowed	to	them	with	his	hand	on	his	heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	am	a	withered	old	fool,	and	not	quick	at	all.	Forgive	me.	But	thus	it	stands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since	you	did	not	guess,	through	pardonable	ignorance	of	a	certain	fact,	then,	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	pleasure	of	absolute	proof,	I	withhold	my	discovery	a	little	longer.	There	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">drama	 here,	 but	 we	 must	 be	 skilled	 dramatists	 and	 not	 spoil	 our	 climax,	 or anticipate	it.	To-morrow	it	shall	be—perhaps	even	to-night.	You	are	not	going	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	kept	long	in	suspense.	Nor	will	I	go	alone	and	disobey	Scotland	Yard.	Your</p>
<p class="calibre1">aged	 pet—this	 spaniel	 dog—shall	 join	 me.	 Good	 Prince	 and	 I	 will	 retire	 early and,	 if	 you	 so	 desire	 it,	 we	 shall	 be	 very	 willing	 to	 welcome	 you	 in	 the	 Grey Room—say	 some	 six	 or	 seven	 hours	 later.	 I	 do	 not	 sleep	 there,	 but	 merely sustain	 a	 vigil,	 as	 all	 the	 others	 did.	 But	 it	 will	 be	 briefer	 than	 theirs.	 You	 will oblige	me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary	spoke,	seeing	the	pain	on	her	father's	face.	She	felt	certain	that	the	old</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	knew	perfectly	what	he	was	talking	about.	She	had	spoken	aside	to	Henry, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	he	agreed	with	her.	Mannetti	had	solved	the	mystery;	he	had	even	enabled</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	 to	 solve	 it;	 but	 now,	 perhaps	 to	 punish	 them	 for	 their	 stupidity,	 he	 was deliberately	 withholding	 the	 key,	 half	 from	 love	 of	 effect,	 half	 in	 a	 spirit	 of mischief.	He	was	planning	something	theatrical.	He	saw	himself	at	the	centre	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	stage	in	this	tragic	drama,	and	it	was	not	unnatural	that	he	should	desire	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">figure	there	effectively	after	taking	so	much	trouble.	Thus,	while	Sir	Walter	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">opposed,	 he	 was	 surprised	 to	 hear	 Mary	 plead	 on	 the	 visitor's	 behalf,	 and	 his nephew	support	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Signor	 Mannetti	 is	 quite	 right,	 father;	 I	 am	 positive	 of	 it,"	 she	 said.	 "He	 is right;	and	because	he	is	right,	he	is	safe." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Admirably	put!"	cried	the	Italian.	"There	you	have	the	situation	in	a	nutshell, my	 friends.	 Trust	 a	 clever	 woman's	 intuition.	 I	 am	 indeed	 right.	 Never	 was consciousness	 of	 right	 so	 impressed	 upon	 my	 mind—prone	 as	 I	 am	 always	 to doubt	my	own	conclusions.	I	am,	in	fact,	right	because	I	cannot	be	wrong.	Trust</p>
<p class="calibre1">me.	 My	 own	 safety	 is	 absolutely	 assured,	 for	 we	 are	 concerned	 with	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">operations	of	men	like	ourselves—at	least,	I	hope	very	different	from	ourselves, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 men,	 nevertheless.	 It	 was	 your	 fate	 to	 revive	 this	 horror;	 it	 shall	 be	 my privilege	 to	 banish	 it	 out	 of	 the	 earth.	 At	 a	 breath	 the	 cunning	 of	 the	 ungodly shall	be	brought	to	nought.	And	not	before	it	is	time.	But	the	mills	of	God	grind</p>
<p class="calibre1">slowly.	 Our	 achievement	 will	 certainly	 resound	 to	 the	 corners	 of	 the	 civilized world." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	 as	 positive	 as	 the	 signor	 himself	 that	 he	 is	 safe,	 uncle,"	 said	 Henry Lennox. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a>"Let	us	go	to	tea,"	replied	Sir	Walter.	"These	things	are	far	too	deep	for	a	plain man.	I	only	ask	you	to	consider	all	this	must	mean	to	me	who	am	the	master	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chadlands	and	responsible	to	the	authorities.	Reflect	if	ill	overtook	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	is	impossible	that	it	can." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	others	believed.	And	where	are	they?	Further	trouble	would	unhinge	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind,	signor." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	have	endured	enough	to	make	you	speak	so	strongly,	and	your	brave	girl</p>
<p class="calibre1">also.	But	fear	nothing	whatever.	I	am	far	too	deeply	concerned	and	committed	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	behalf	to	add	a	drop	to	the	bitter	drink	of	the	past,	my	dear	Sir	Walter.	I	am</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 safe	 in	 that	 room	 as	 I	 should	 be	 at	 the	 altar	 steps	 of	 St.	 Peter's.	 Trust	 old Prince,	if	you	cannot	trust	me.	I	rely	largely	on	your	blind	pet	to	aid	me.	He	has</p>
<p class="calibre1">good	work	to	do	yet,	faithful	fellow." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 detectives	 took	 animals	 into	 the	 room,	 but	 they	 were	 not	 hurt,"	 said Lennox. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Neither	shall	the	dog	be	hurt." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	patted	the	sleeping	spaniel,	and	they	rose	and	went	into	the	house	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mannetti	evidently	assumed	that	his	wishes	were	to	be	granted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	will	go	and	sleep	awhile,"	he	said.	"Until	an	early	dinner,	excuse	me,	and	let Mrs.	 May	 and	 Mr.	 Lennox	 convince	 you,	 as	 they	 are	 themselves	 convinced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These	events	have	immensely	excited	my	vitality.	I	little	guessed	that,	at	the	end</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	my	days,	a	sensation	so	remarkable	lay	in	store	for	me.	I	must	conserve	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">strength	for	to-night.	I	am	well—very	well—and	supported	by	the	consciousness</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	coming	triumph.	Such	an	achievement	would	have	rewarded	my	long	journey</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	these	exertions,	even	had	not	your	acquaintance	been	ample	reward	already. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 will,	 then,	 sleep	 until	 dinner-time,	 and	 so	 be	 replenished	 to	 play	 my	 part	 in	 a wonderful	though	melancholy	romance.	Let	us	dine	at	seven,	if	you	please." </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	excitement	and	natural	levity	strove	with	the	gloomy	facts.	He	resembled</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	mourner	at	a	funeral	who	experiences	pleasant	rather	than	painful	emotions	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">continually	reminds	himself	to	behave	in	a	manner	appropriate	to	the	occasion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	sent	for	his	man,	and,	on	Stephano's	arm,	the	old	gentleman	withdrew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	returned	for	a	moment,	however,	and	spoke	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	 will	 do	 exactly	 as	 I	 wish	 and	 allow	 no	 human	 being	 to	 enter	 the	 Grey Room.	 Keep	 the	 key	 in	 your	 pocket,	 Sir	 Walter;	 and	 do	 not	 go	 there	 yourself either.	It	is	still	a	trap	of	death	for	everybody	else	in	the	world	but	myself." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	XII.	THE	GOLDEN	BULL</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Masters	came	to	clear	the	tea,	he	found	Sir	Walter	still	unconvinced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	 do	 you	 think	 of	 Signor	 Mannetti,	 Masters?"	 asked	 Henry;	 and	 the butler,	who	was	a	great	reader	of	the	newspapers,	made	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	think	he's	a	bit	of	a	freak,	Mr.	Henry.	They	tell	me	that	old	people	can	have a	slice	of	monkey	slipped	into	'em	nowadays—to	keep	'em	going	and	make	'em</p>
<p class="calibre1">young	 and	 lively	 again.	 Well,	 I	 should	 say	 the	 gentleman	 had	 a	 whole	 monkey popped	in	somewhere.	I	never	see	such	another.	He's	got	a	tongue	like	a	rat-trap, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	he	leaves	you	guessing	every	time.	He's	amazing	clever;	so's	his	man.	That</p>
<p class="calibre1">Stephano	 knows	 a	 thing	 or	 two!	 He's	 got	 round	 Jane	 Bond	 something</p>
<p class="calibre1">disgraceful.	 I	 never	 knew	 what	 was	 in	 Jane—and	 her	 five	 and	 fifty	 if	 she's	 an hour." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Would	he	be	safe	in	the	Grey	Room?"	said	Sir	Walter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He'd	be	safe	anywhere.	The	question	in	my	mind	is	whether	our	silver's	safe; </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	a	few	other	things.	I	catched	him	poking	about	in	the	silver	table	only	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">morning.	 He	 knows	 what's	 what.	 He	 knows	 everything.	 I	 wouldn't	 say	 he	 ain't one	of	the	swell	mob	myself—made	up	to	look	like	an	old	man.	I'll	swear	he's</p>
<p class="calibre1">never	seen	eighty	years	for	all	he	pretends." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	you	be	frightened	of	him,	Masters;	he's	all	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let	him	go	in	the	Grey	Room	by	all	means,	Mr.	Henry.	He	knows	he's	safe</p>
<p class="calibre1">anywhere.	Yes,	Sir	Walter,	he	knows	he's	safe	enough.	He's	got	the	measure	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Prince	is	to	go	with	him,	Masters." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Prince!	Why,	ma'am?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	don't	know.	He	wishes	it.	He	can't	hurt	poor	old	Prince	anyway." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	I	sha'n't	sleep	no	worse;	and	I	hope	none	of	you	won't,	if	you'll	excuse me.	 Come	 what	 will,	 there's	 nothing	 in	 the	 Grey	 Room	 will	 catch	 that	 man napping.	Not	that	I'm	against	the	gentleman	in	general,	you	understand.	Only	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wouldn't	trust	him	a	foot.	He's	play-acting,	and	he's	no	more	a	foreigner	than	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">am—else	he	couldn't	talk	so	fine	English	as	I	do,	if	not	finer." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Masters	is	on	our	side,	father,"	said	Mary.	"And	he's	right.	The	signor	is	play-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a>acting.	He	loves	to	be	in	the	centre	of	the	stage.	All	old	people	do,	and	one	of	the pathetic	 things	 in	 life	 is	 that	 they're	 seldom	 allowed	 to	 be.	 So	 he's	 making	 the most	of	his	opportunity." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	if	you	refuse,	Uncle	Walter,	he'll	only	go	away	and	say	he	cannot	help</p>
<p class="calibre1">you,	 and	 accuse	 us	 of	 giving	 him	 all	 this	 trouble	 for	 nothing,"	 added	 Henry Lennox. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	had	their	wish	at	last,	and	when	Signor	Mannetti	came	down	to	an	early</p>
<p class="calibre1">dinner	in	splendid	spirits,	Sir	Walter	conceded	his	desire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good,	my	friend!	And	do	not	fear	that	a	night	of	anxiety	awaits	you.	Indeed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">if	I	am	not	mistaken,	it	will	be	possible	for	us	all	to	sleep	very	soundly,	though</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	may	go	to	bed	rather	late.	But	I	think	we	must	be	prepared	not	to	retire	till</p>
<p class="calibre1">after	two	o'clock.	I	will	enter	upon	my	watch	at	eight—in	half	an	hour.	The	door</p>
<p class="calibre1">shall	be	left	open,	as	you	wish.	But	I	beg	that	none	will	approach	the	east	end	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 corridor.	 That	 is	 only	 fair.	 I	 will,	 however,	 permit	 Mr.	 Lennox	 to	 station himself	on	the	top	of	the	great	staircase,	and	from	time	to	time	he	may	challenge</p>
<p class="calibre1">me.	 He	 shall	 say	 'Is	 all	 well?'	 and	 be	 sure	 I	 shall	 answer	 'All	 is	 well.'	 Could anything	be	more	satisfactory?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Signor	 Mannetti	 ate	 sparingly,	 then	 he	 donned	 a	 big,	 fur,	 motor-coat	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">declared	 himself	 ready.	 They	 thought	 he	 had	 forgotten	 Prince,	 but	 he	 insisted upon	the	company	of	the	ancient	spaniel.	The	dog	had	fed,	and	he	could	sleep	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">well	in	one	place	as	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fear	not,"	said	the	Italian.	"I	shall	be	considerate	to	your	ancient	pet.	I	do	not beg	his	aid	without	reason.	He	is	on	my	side	and	will	help	me	if	he	can—infirm</p>
<p class="calibre1">though	he	be.	I	have	made	friends	with	him.	Set	him	at	my	feet.	I	will	sit	here</p>
<p class="calibre1">under	the	electric	light	and	read	my	Italian	papers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus	 once	 again	 a	 solitary	 occupied	 the	 Grey	 Room	 and	 measured	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">intelligence	 against	 the	 terrible	 forces	 therein	 concealed.	 Signor	 Mannetti	 took leave	 of	 them	 cheerfully	 at	 eight	 o'clock,	 and	 while	 Sir	 Walter	 and	 Mary descended	 to	 the	 library,	 Henry	 took	 up	 his	 station	 at	 the	 head	 of	 the	 staircase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	corridor	was	lighted	and	the	door	of	the	Grey	Room	left	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 in	 ten	 minutes	 the	 watcher	 looked	 out	 and	 cried	 to	 Lennox,	 who	 sat</p>
<p class="calibre1">smoking	about	thirty-five	yards	from	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	is	a	great	draught	here,"	he	said.	"I	will	close	the	door,	but	leave	it	ajar that	we	may	salute	each	other	from	time	to	time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 hours	 crept	 on	 and	 since	 everybody	 at	 Chadlands	 knew	 what	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">happening,	few	retired	to	rest.	It	was	understood	that	some	time	after	midnight</p>
<p class="calibre1">Signor	Mannetti	hoped	to	declare	the	result	of	his	experiment. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a>Henry	 Lennox	 challenged	 half-hourly,	 always	 receiving	 a	 brisk	 reply.	 But	 a little	after	half-past	one	his	"All	well,	signor?"	received	no	response.	He	raised his	voice,	but	still	no	answer	came.	He	went	to	the	door,	therefore,	and	looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	the	Grey	Room.	The	watcher	had	slipped	down	in	the	armchair	they	had	set</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 him	 under	 the	 electric	 light,	 and	 was	 lying	 motionless,	 but	 in	 an	 easy position.	 He	 still	 wore	 his	 fur-coat.	 Prince	 Henry	 did	 not	 see.	 The	 room	 was silent	and	cold.	The	electric	light	burned	brightly,	and	both	windows	were	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Young	Lennox	hastened	downstairs.	His	thoughts	concentrated	on	his	uncle,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	desire	was	to	spare	him	any	needless	shock.	For	a	moment	he	believed	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Signor	Mannetti	had	succumbed	in	the	Grey	Room,	as	others	before	him,	but	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	not	be	certain.	A	bare	half-hour	had	elapsed	since	the	watcher	had	uttered</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	cheerful	answer	to	the	last	summons,	and	told	them	his	vigil	was	nearly	ended. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lennox	sought	Masters,	therefore,	told	him	that	the	worst	was	to	be	feared,	yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">explained	 that	 the	 old	 man	 who	 had	 watched	 in	 the	 Grey	 Room	 might	 not	 be dead	but	sunk	in	sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Masters	was	sanguine	that	it	might	be	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Be	sure	he	is	so.	I'll	fetch	the	liqueur	brandy,"	and,	armed	with	his	panacea, he	 followed	 Henry	 upstairs.	 Signor	 Mannetti	 had	 not	 moved,	 but	 as	 they</p>
<p class="calibre1">approached	him,	to	their	infinite	relief	he	did	so,	opened	his	eyes,	stared	wildly</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	him,	and	then	realized	the	situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Alas!	Now	I	have	frightened	you	out	of	your	senses,"	he	said,	looking	at	their anxious	 faces.	 "All	 is	 well.	 In	 less	 than	 another	 hour	 I	 should	 have	 summoned Sir	Walter.	But	just	that	last	half-hour	overcame	me,	and	I	sank	into	sleep.	What</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	the	time?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	quarter	to	two,	signor." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good!	Then	let	your	uncle	be	summoned.	I	have	found	out	the	secret." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	thimbleful	of	old	cognac,	signor?"	asked	Masters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Willingly,	my	friend,	willingly.	I	see	how	wise	you	both	were.	I	approve	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">thank	you.	You	thought	that	I	had	followed	the	others	into	the	shades,	yet	meant</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 restore	 me	 if	 you	 could	 without	 frightening	 Sir	 Walter.	 To	 go	 to	 sleep	 was unpardonable." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Abraham	 Masters	 and	 Henry	 descended	 with	 the	 good	 news,	 while	 the	 old</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	drank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	shall	detain	you	half	an	hour	or	so,"	he	said,	when	they	all	returned	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	I	have	no	fear	that	anybody	will	want	to	fall	asleep." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Walter	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a>"Thank	Heaven,	signor,	thank	Heaven!	All	is	well	with	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	 is	 absolutely	 well	 with	 me,	 but	 then	 I	 have	 slept	 refreshingly	 for	 some time.	You,	I	fear,	have	not	closed	your	eyes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Would	you	have	any	objection	to	Masters	hearing	what	you	may	have	to	tell</p>
<p class="calibre1">us?	By	so	doing	a	true	and	ungarbled	report	will	get	out	to	Chadlands." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My	report	will	go	out	to	the	whole	world,	Sir	Walter.	All	is	accomplished	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">established	on	certain	proofs.	Your	good	spaniel	has	played	his	part	also.	I	salute</p>
<p class="calibre1">him—the	old	Prince." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	 now	 observed	 that	 the	 dog	 was	 stretched	 on	 the	 floor	 at	 Signor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mannetti's	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Still	asleep?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary	knelt	to	pat	the	spaniel	and	started	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	horribly	cold	he	is!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"For	ever	asleep—a	martyr	to	science.	He	was	to	die	on	Friday,	remember.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">has	 received	 euthanasia	 a	 little	 sooner,	 and	 nothing	 in	 his	 life	 has	 become	 him like	 the	 leaving	 of	 it.	 The	 last	 victim	 of	 the	 Grey	 Room.	 Mourn	 him	 not,	 he passed	without	a	pang—as	did	his	betters." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But,	but—you	spoke	of	crime	and	criminals!"	gasped	Sir	Walter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	 truly.	 Great	 crimes	 have	 been	 committed	 in	 this	 room	 and	 great</p>
<p class="calibre1">criminals	 committed	 them.	 Is	 a	 crime	 any	 less	 a	 crime	 because	 the	 doers	 have mouldered	in	their	dishonored	graves	for	nearly	five	hundred	years?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your	handling	of	speech	is	not	ours,	and	you	use	words	differently.	The	old</p>
<p class="calibre1">dog	did	not	suffer,	you	say?	How	did	he	come	to	die—in	his	sleep?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even	so.	Without	a	sigh,	the	last	venerable	victim	of	this	murdering	shadow." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	saw	him	die,	and	yet	were	safe	yourself,	sir?"	asked	Lennox. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	is	what	happened.	Now	sit	down	all	of	you,	father	Abraham	also,	and	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">five	minutes	all	will	be	as	clear	as	day." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	obeyed	him	silently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	 a	 master	 criminal,	 one	 whose	 name	 has	 rung	 down	 the	 ages	 and	 will from	 to-morrow	 win	 a	 further	 resonance.	 Would	 that	 we	 could	 bring	 him	 to account;	but	he	has	already	gone	to	it,	if	justice	lies	at	the	root	of	things,	as	all men	pray,	and	you	and	I	believe,	Sir	Walter.	An	interesting	reflection:	How	many</p>
<p class="calibre1">suffer,	if	they	do	not	actually	perish,	from	the	sins	of	the	dead?	Not	only	the	sins of	our	father	are	visited	upon	us,	but,	if	we	could	trace	the	infliction,	the	crimes of	 countless	 dead	 men	 accomplished	 long	 before	 we	 were	 born	 into	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a>suffering	 world.	 I	 speak	 in	 a	 parable,	 but	 this	 is	 literal,	 actual.	 Dead	 men committed	these	murders,	and	left	this	legacy	of	woe." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Signor	Mannetti	stroked	the	lifeless	spaniel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"When	we	were	left	alone	I	picked	him	up	and	set	him	on	the	bed.	He	did	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">waken,	 and	 I	 knew	 that	 he	 would	 never	 waken	 again.	 Now	 let	 us	 look	 at	 this noble	bed,	if	you	please.	Here	is	the	link,	you	see,	without	which	so	much	that	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">told	 you	 yesterday	 must	 have	 sounded	 no	 more	 than	 the	 idle	 chatter	 of	 an	 old man.	Come	and	use	your	eyes.	Ah,	if	only	people	had	used	their	eyes	sooner!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 followed	 him,	 and	 he	 pointed	 to	 a	 framework	 of	 carved	 wood	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">connected	the	four	posts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	 is	 this	 on	 the	 frieze	 running	 above	 the	 capitals	 of	 the	 little	 Ionic pillars?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	papal	crown	and	keys,"	said	Mary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good!	Now	regard	the	other	side." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	coat	of	arms—a	golden	bull	on	a	red	ground—why,	father,	that	was	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">puzzled	you	at	Florence!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Surely	 it	 was.	 The	 thing	 stuck	 in	 my	 memory,	 yet	 I	 could	 not	 remember where	I	had	seen	it	before." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Signor	Mannetti	prepared	for	his	effect,	then	made	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 arms	 of	 the	 Borgia!	 The	 arms	 of	 the	 Spanish	 Pope,	 Alexander	 VI.	 of unholy	memory.	So	all	is	told,	and	we	will	soon	go	to	bed.	Having	marked	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	morning,	you	will	see	how	readily	I	was	led	into	the	heart	of	the	secret.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	 needed	 some	 such	 certain	 sign.	 And	 everything	 that	 had	 happened	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">consonant	with	this	explanation.	The	first	to	suffer	puzzled	me;	but	I	solved	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">problem,	too.	You	shall	hear	how	each	woman	and	each	man	was	slain.	Look	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	 mattress	 upholstered	 in	 satin—there	 lies	 the	 unsleeping	 thing	 that	 brings sleep	 so	 quickly	 to	 others!	 I	 guessed	 it	 this	 morning;	 I	 proved	 it	 to-night.	 At seventeen	 minutes	 past	 eight	 Prince	 was	 dead;	 but	 not	 until	 I	 awoke,	 near	 two o'clock,	did	I	dare	approach	him.	For	how	did	he	die?	The	moment	the	heat	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	ancient	body	penetrated	the	mattress	under	him,	it	released	its	awful	venom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stretched	himself,	curled	up	again,	and,	as	the	exhalation	rose,	with	scarcely</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	tremor	he	passed	from	sleep	into	death.	Needless	to	tell	you	that	I	kept	far	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">him,	for	I	guessed	that	not	until	the	poor	fellow	was	cold	would	the	demon	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mattress	sink	down	and	disappear,	as	the	effret	into	his	bottle.	Then	mattress	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">dog	were	alike	harmless,	as	they	are	now.	I	gave	him	only	five	hours,	for	he	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	small,	thin	beast,	and	the	heat	soon	left	his	body." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a>"But,	signor—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	shall	anticipate	all	your	objections	if	you	will	listen	a	little	longer,	dear	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">May.	Let	us	sit	again,	and	question	me	after	I	have	spoken,	if	any	doubts	remain</p>
<p class="calibre1">unanswered.	Another	liqueur,	Masters." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	sipped,	and	preserved	silence	for	a	few	moments,	while	none	spoke.	Then</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 his	 armchair	 he	 traversed	 the	 story	 of	 the	 Grey	 Room,	 and	 proved</p>
<p class="calibre1">amazingly	 familiar	 with	 the	 smallest	 detail	 of	 it.	 Indeed,	 when	 at	 last	 he	 had finished,	 none	 could	 find	 any	 questions	 to	 ask.	 "There	 are	 two	 very	 interesting preliminary	facts	to	note,	my	friends,"	began	the	signor.	He	beamed	upon	them, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 enjoyed	 his	 own	 exposition	 with	 unconcealed	 gusto.	 "The	 first	 is	 that	 a room,	already	suffering	 from	sinister	traditions,	 and	held	to	 be	haunted,	should</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 been	 precisely	 that	 into	 which	 this	 infernal	 engine	 of	 destruction	 was introduced.	 Yet	 what	 more	 natural?	 You	 have	 the	 furniture,	 and,	 for	 the	 time being,	 do	 not	 know	 what	 to	 do	 with	 it.	 The	 house	 is	 already	 full	 of	 beautiful things,	and	these	surplus	treasures	you	store	here,	to	be	safe	and	out	of	the	way, </p>
<p class="calibre1">in	a	room	which	is	not	put	to	its	proper	use.	You	are	not	collectors	or	experts.	Sir Walter's	father	did	not	share	his	father's	enthusiasm,	neither	did	Sir	Walter	care</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 old	 furniture.	 So	 the	 pieces	 take	 their	 place	 in	 this	 room,	 and	 are,	 more	 or less,	forgotten. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	is	the	first	interesting	fact,	and	the	second	seems	to	me	to	be	this:	that those	 who	 perished	 here	 in	 living	 memory	 all	 died	 at	 different	 places	 in	 the room,	and	so	died	that	their	deaths	could	not	be	immediately	and	undeviatingly</p>
<p class="calibre1">traced	to	the	bed.	Hardcastle,	for	example,	as	you	have	related	his	conversation, </p>
<p class="calibre1">did	 not	 associate	 the	 death	 of	 poor	 Captain	 May	 with	 that	 of	 the	 lady	 of	 the hospital	eleven	years	before;	and	Sir	Walter	himself	saw	no	reason	to	connect	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	earlier	death	of	his	aged	aunt,	which	took	place	when	he	was	a	boy,	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">disaster	that	followed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let	us	now	examine	for	a	moment	the	amazing	fact	that	none	of	the	stigmata</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	death	was	found	in	those	who	perished	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Death	has	three	modes—the	pale	horseman	strikes	us	down	by	asphyxia,	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">coma,	and	by	syncope.	In	asphyxia	he	stabs	the	lungs;	in	coma	his	lance	is	aimed</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	the	brain;	in	syncope,	at	the	heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"When	 a	 man	 dies	 by	 asphyxia,	 it	 means	 that	 the	 action	 of	 the	 muscles	 by which	he	breathes	is	stopped,	or	the	work	of	his	lungs	prevented	by	injury,	or	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">free	passage	of	air	arrested,	as	in	drowning,	or	strangulation.	It	may	also	mean</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	embolism	has	taken	place,	and	the	pulmonary	artery	is	blocked,	withholding</p>
<p class="calibre1">blood	from	the	lungs.	But	it	was	not	thus	that	any	died	in	this	chamber. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a>"Coma	 occurs	 through	 an	 apoplexy,	 or	 concussion;	 by	 the	 use	 of	 certain narcotic	or	mineral	poisons;	and	in	various	other	ways,	all	of	which	are	ruled	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	 remains	 syncope.	 A	 heart	 ceases	 to	 beat	 from	 haemorrhage,	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1">starvation,	 from	 exhaustion,	 or	 the	 depressing	 influence	 of	 certain	 drugs.	 They who	 died	 here	 died	 from	 syncope;	 but	 why?	 No	 autopsy	 can	 tell	 us	 why.	 They passed	 with	 only	 their	 Maker	 to	 sustain	 them,	 and	 none	 leaves	 behind	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">explanation	 of	 what	 overtook	 him,	 or	 her.	 Yet	 we	 know	 full	 well,	 even	 in	 the case	 of	 Peter	 Hardcastle,	 concerning	 whom	 the	 police	 felt	 doubt,	 that	 he	 was quite	dead	before	Mr.	Lennox	discovered	him	and	picked	him	up.	We	know	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 phenomena	 of	 rigor	 mortis	 had	 already	 set	 in	 before	 his	 body	 reached London. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothing,	however,	is	new	under	the	sun.	Many	journals	related	the	fact	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	 people	 had	 passed	 away	 without	 a	 cause,	 as	 though	 it	 were	 an	 event without	 a	 parallel.	 It	 is	 not.	 Your	 Dr.	 Templeman,	 in	 1893,	 describes	 two examples	of	sudden	death	with	absolute	absence	of	any	pathological	condition	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	part	of	the	bodies	to	account	for	it.	He	describes	the	case	of	a	man	of	forty-</p>
<p class="calibre1">three,	 and	 calls	 it	 'emotional	 inhibition	 of	 the	 heart.'	 The	 heart	 was	 arrested	 in diastole,	 instead	 of	 systole,	 as	 is	 usually	 the	 case;	 the	 mode	 of	 death	 was syncope;	the	cause	of	death,	undiscoverable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	 layman	 may	 be	 permitted,	 I	 suppose,	 to	 describe	 'emotional	 inhibition	 of the	 heart'	 as	 'shock';	 but	 we	 know,	 in	 our	 cases,	 that	 if	 a	 shock,	 it	 was	 not	 a painful	one—perhaps	not	even	an	unpleasant	one.	Since	all	other	emotions	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 pleasant	 or	 unpleasant,	 why	 must	 we	 assume	 that	 the	 supreme	 emotion	 of death	 may	 not	 be	 pleasant	 also,	 did	 we	 know	 how	 to	 make	 it	 so?	 Perhaps	 the Borgia,	 among	 their	 secrets,	 had	 discovered	 this.	 At	 least	 the	 familiar	 signs	 of death	were	wholly	absent	from	the	countenances	of	the	dead.	The	jaws	were	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">set;	the	familiar,	expressions	were	not	changed,	as	usually	happens	from	rigidity</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	facial	muscles;	their	faces	were	not	sallow;	their	temples	were	not	sunk;	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">brows	were	not	contracted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	will	now	take	the	victims,	one	by	one,	and	show	how	death	happened	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">each	of	them,	yet	left	no	sign	that	it	had	happened.	Frankly,	the	first	case	alone</p>
<p class="calibre1">presented	any	difficulties	to	me.	For	a	time	I	despaired	of	proving	how	the	bed</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 destroyed	 Sir	 Walter's	 ancestor,	 because	 she	 had	 not	 entered	 it.	 But	 the difficulty	 becomes	 clear	 to	 one	 possessing	 our	 present	 knowledge,	 for	 once prove	the	properties	of	the	bed,	and	the	rest	follows.	You	will	say	that	they	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 proved,	 only	 guessed.	 That	 was	 true,	 until	 Prince	 died.	 His	 death	 crowned my	 edifice	 of	 theory	 and	 converted	 it	 to	 fact.	 As	 to	 why	 the	 bed	 has	 these</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a>properties,	that	is	for	science	to	find	out	presently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"To	 return,	 then,	 to	 the	 old	 lady,	 the	 ancient	 woman	 of	 your	 race,	 who	 came unexpectedly	to	the	Christmas	re-union	and	was	put	to	sleep	in	the	Grey	Room</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 her	 own	 wish.	 She	 was	 found	 dead	 next	 morning	 on	 the	 floor.	 She	 had	 not entered	the	bed.	The	exact	facts	have	long	disappeared	from	human	knowledge, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	it	is	only	possible	to	re-construct	them	by	inference	and	the	support	of	those</p>
<p class="calibre1">straightforward	 events	 that	 followed.	 I	 conceive,	 then,	 that	 though	 the	 old	 lady did	not	create	the	warmth	that	liberated	the	evil	spirit	of	the	bed	and	so	destroyed her,	that	warmth	was	nevertheless	artificially	created.	What	must	have	happened, </p>
<p class="calibre1">think	you?	The	bed	is	made	up	in	haste	and	the	fire	lighted.	But	the	fire	is	a	long</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	from	the	bed,	and	would	have	no	effect	to	create	the	necessary	temperature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 is,	 however,	 a	 hot-water	 bottle	 in	 the	 bed,	 or	 a	 hot	 brick	 wrapped	 in flannel.	The	old	lady	is	about	to	enter	her	bed.	She	has	extinguished	her	candle, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	the	flame	of	the	fire	gives	light.	She	has	prayed;	she	throws	off	her	dressing-</p>
<p class="calibre1">gown	 and	 flings	 back	 the	 covering	 of	 the	 bed,	 to	 fall	 an	 instant	 victim	 to	 the miasma.	She	drops	backward	and	is	found	dead	next	morning,	by	which	time	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bottle	and	bed	are	also	cold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Taken	 alone,	 I	 grant	 this	 explanation	 may	 fail	 to	 win	 your	 sympathy;	 but consider	 the	 cumulative	 evidence	 in	 store.	 The	 old	 lady	 may,	 of	 course,	 have died	 a	 natural	 death.	 She	 may	 not	 have	 turned	 down	 the	 bed.	 There	 is	 nobody living	 to	 tell	 us.	 All	 that	 Sir	 Walter	 can	 recollect	 is	 that	 she	 was	 found	 on	 the floor	of	the	room	dead.	Exactly	where,	he	does	not	remember.	But	for	my	own</p>
<p class="calibre1">part	I	have	no	doubt	whatever	that	her	death	took	place	in	that	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	are	on	safer	ground	with	the	other	tragic	happenings,	though,	save	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">case	of	Nurse	Forrester,	there	is	nothing	on	the	surface	of	events	to	connect	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">deaths	with	the	accursed	bed.	You	will	see,	however,	that	it	is	very	easy	to	do	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 lady's	 case	 all	 is	 clear	 enough.	 She	 goes	 to	 bed	 tired	 and	 she	 sleeps peacefully	into	death	without	waking.	She	is	probably	asleep	within	ten	minutes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">before	her	own	warmth	has	penetrated	through	sheet	and	blanket	to	the	mattress</p>
<p class="calibre1">beneath	 and	 so	 destroyed	 her.	 Suppose	 that	 she	 is	 dead	 in	 half	 an	 hour.	 She retired	to	rest	at	ten	o'clock;	she	is	called	at	seven;	the	room	is	presently	broken into	and	she	is	then	not	only	dead,	but	cold.	The	demon	has	gone	to	sleep	again</p>
<p class="calibre1">under	 its	 lifeless	 burden.	 Now	 had	 she	 been	 stout	 and	 well	 covered,	 there	 had hardly	 been	 time	 for	 her	 to	 grow	 cold,	 and	 those	 who	 came	 to	 her	 assistance might	 even	 have	 perished,	 too.	 But	 she	 is	 a	 little,	 thin	 thing,	 and	 the	 heat	 has gone	out	of	her.	This	assured	the	safety	of	those	who	came	to	the	bedside.	One</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	make	no	laws	as	to	the	time	necessary	for	a	dead	body	to	grow	as	cold	as	its</p>
<p class="calibre1">surroundings.	The	bodies	of	the	old	and	the	young	cool	more	quickly	than	those</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a>of	adult	persons.	If	the	conditions	are	favorable	a	body	may	cool	in	six	to	eight hours.	Prince	took	but	five,	poor	little	bag	of	bones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In	 the	 case	 of	 Captain	 May	 the	 conditions	 are	 altogether	 different.	 Let	 me speak	with	all	tenderness	and	spare	you	pain.	Be	sure	that	he	suffered	no	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	 the	 others.	 The	 bed	 is	 now	 no	 longer	 made;	 the	 mattress	 is	 bare.	 That matters	not	to	him.	Clad	in	his	pyjamas,	with	a	railway	rug	to	cover	him	and	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">dressing-gown	for	a	pillow,	he	flings	himself	down,	and	from	his	powerful	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sanguine	frame	warmth	is	instantly	communicated	to	the	mattress	that	supports</p>
<p class="calibre1">him.	Probably	but	a	few	minutes	were	sufficient	to	liberate	the	poison.	He	is	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">asleep,	 but	 on	 the	 edge	 of	 sleep	 when	 he	 becomes	 suddenly	 conscious	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">physical	sensations	beyond	his	experience.	He	had	breathed	death,	but	yet	he	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	dead.	His	brain	works,	and	can	send	a	message	to	his	limbs,	which	are	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">able	to	obey.	But	his	hour	has	come.	He	leaps	from	the	bed	in	no	suffering,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">conscious,	 perhaps	 of	 an	 oppression,	 or	 an	 unfamiliar	 odor—we	 cannot	 say</p>
<p class="calibre1">what.	 We	 only	 know	 that	 he	 feels	 intense	 surprise,	 not	 pain	 for	 in	 that	 dying moment	his	emotions	are	fixed	for	ever	by	the	muscles	of	his	face.	He	needs	air</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	seeks	it.	He	hurries	to	the	recess,	kneels	on	the	cushion,	and	throws	open	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">window.	Or	the	window	may	have	been	already	open—we	cannot	tell.	To	reach</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 is	 his	 last	 conscious	 act,	 and	 in	 another	 moment	 he	 is	 dead.	 The	 bed	 is	 not suspected.	Why	should	it	be?	Who	could	prove	that	he	had	even	laid	down	upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">it?	Indeed	it	was	believed	and	reported	at	the	inquest	that	he	had	not	done	so.	Yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	is	what	unquestionably	happened.	Otherwise	his	candle	would	have	burned</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	socket.	He	had	blown	it	out	and	settled	to	rest,	be	sure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	have	now	to	deal	with	the	detective,	and	here	again	there	was	nothing	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">associate	his	death	with	the	bed	of	the	Borgia.	Yet	you	will	see	without	my	aid</p>
<p class="calibre1">how	 easily	 he	 came	 by	 his	 death.	 Peter	 Hardcastle	 desires	 to	 be	 alone,	 that	 he may	 study	 the	 Grey	 Room	 and	 everything	 in	 it.	 He	 is	 left	 as	 he	 wishes,	 walks here	 and	 there,	 sketches	 a	 ground	 plan	 of	 the	 room	 and	 exhausts	 its	 more obvious	peculiarities.	Would	that	he	had	known	the	meaning	of	the	golden	bull! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Presently	he	strikes	a	train	of	thought	and	sits	down	to	develop	it.	Or	he	may	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	finished	with	the	room	and	have	taken	a	seat	from	which	he	could	survey</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything	around	him.	He	sits	at	the	foot	of	the	bed—there	on	the	right	side.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">makes	his	notes,	then	his	last	thoughts	enter	his	mind—abstract	reflection	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">subject	of	his	trade.	For	a	moment	he	forgets	the	matter	immediately	in	hand	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">writes	his	ideas	in	his	book.	He	has	been	sitting	on	the	bed	now	for	some	while</p>
<p class="calibre1">—how	long	we	know	not,	but	long	enough	to	create	the	heightened	temperature</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	 is	 all	 the	 watchful	 fiend	 within	 the	 mattress	 requires	 to	 summon	 him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	ascends	the	spirit	of	death,	and	Hardcastle,	surprised	as	Captain	May	was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a>surprised,	leaps	to	his	feet.	He	takes	two	or	three	steps	forward;	his	book	and	pen fall	from	his	hand	and	he	drops	upon	his	face—a	dead	man.	He	is,	of	course,	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">warm	when	Mr.	Lennox	finds	him;	but	the	bed	he	leaped	from	is	cold	again	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">harmless—its	work	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	remains	the	priest,	the	Rev.	Septimus	May.	He	neither	lay	on	the	bed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">nor	 sat	 upon	 it.	 But	 what	 did	 he	 do?	 He	 clearly	 knelt	 beside	 it	 a	 long	 time, engaged	 in	 prayer.	 Nothing	 more	 natural	 than	 that	 he	 should	 stretch	 his	 arms over	the	mattress;	bury	his	face	in	his	hands,	and	so	remain	in	commune	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Almighty,	uttering	petition	after	petition	for	the	being	he	conceived	as	existing	in the	 Grey	 Room,	 without	 power	 to	 escape	 from	 it.	 Thus	 leaning	 upon	 the	 bed with	 his	 arms	 stretched	 upon	 it	 and	 his	 head	 perhaps	 sunk	 between	 them,	 he presently	creates	that	heightened	temperature	sufficient	to	arouse	the	destroyer.	It enters	into	him—how,	we	know	not	yet—and	he	sinks	unconscious	to	the	floor, </p>
<p class="calibre1">while	the	bed	is	quickly	cold	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As	 to	 the	 four	 detectives—Inspector	 Frith	 and	 his	 men—pure	 chance	 saved the	 life	 of	 at	 least	 one	 of	 them,	 and	 by	 so	 doing,	 chance	 also	 prevented	 them from	discovering	that	the	bed	in	their	midst	was	the	seat	of	all	the	trouble.	Had</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	among	them	taken	up	his	watch	upon	it,	he	would	certainly	have	died	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">presence	 of	 his	 collaborators;	 but	 the	 men	 sat	 on	 chairs	 in	 the	 corners	 of	 the room,	and	the	chairs	were	harmless.	Whether	their	gas	masks	would	indeed	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">saved	them	remains,	of	course,	to	be	proved.	I	doubt	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Such,	 my	 friends,	 were	 the	 masterpieces	 of	 the	 Borgia,	 for	 whom	 the profoundest	chemists	worked	willingly	enough	and	by	doing	so	doubtless	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 fortunes.	 Their	 poisons	 were	 so	 designed	 to	 act	 that,	 by	 their	 very operation,	 the	 secrets	 of	 them	 were	 concealed,	 and	 all	 clues	 obliterated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chemistry	 knows	 nothing	 of	 the	 supernatural,	 yet	 can,	 as	 in	 this	 case,	 achieve results	that	may	well	appear	to	be	black	magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	if	we,	of	this	day,	fail	to	find	them	out,	it	is	easy	to	guess	that	in	their own	times,	much	that	they	caused	to	be	done	was	set	down	to	the	operations	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Heaven	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Science	 will	 be	 deeply	 interested	 in	 your	 Borgia	 mattress,	 Sir	 Walter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Science,	 I	 doubt	 not,	 will	 carefully	 unpick	 it	 and	 make	 a	 series	 of	 very remarkable	experiments;	yet	I	make	bold	to	believe	that	science	may	be	baffled</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	 the	 cunning	 and	 forgotten	 knowledge	 of	 men	 long	 dust.	 We	 shall	 see	 as	 to that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	rose	and	bade	Masters	call	Stephano.	Then,	with	a	few	words,	they	parted, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	each	shook	the	old	man's	hand	and	expressed	a	deep	and	genuine	gratitude</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>before	they	did	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	little	remains	to	add,"	said	Signor	Mannetti.	"You	shall	hear	what	it	is	to-morrow.	 For	 the	 moment,	 'Good-night!'	 It	 has	 been	 a	 crowning	 joy	 to	 my	 long life	that	I	was	able	to	do	this	service	to	new	and	valued	friends." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	servants'	hall	next	morning	Masters	related	what	he	had	heard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	 if	 you	 ask	 me,"	 he	 concluded,	 "I	 draw	 back	 what	 I	 thought	 about	 him being	 younger	 than	 he	 pretends.	 He's	 older—old	 as	 the	 hills—older	 than	 that horror	 in	 the	 Grey	 Boom.	 He's	 a	 demon;	 and	 he's	 killed	 the	 old	 dog;	 and	 I believe	he's	a	Borge	himself	if	the	truth	was	known." </p>

<p class="calibre1">They	 walked	 in	 the	 garden	 next	 morning,	 and	 Sir	 Walter	 delayed	 to	 write	 to Scotland	 Yard	 until	 after	 seeing	 Signor	 Mannetti	 again.	 The	 old	 gentleman</p>

<p class="calibre1">"I	must	sit	in	the	sun	and	go	to	sleep	again	after	lunch,"	he	said.	"Stephano	is annoyed	with	me,	and	hints	at	the	doctor." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mannering	 will	 be	 here	 to	 lunch.	 You	 will	 understand	 that	 nobody	 is	 more deeply	interested	in	these	things	than	he." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	yourself,"	said	Mary.	"Come	and	sit	down	and	rest.	You	are	looking	very tired	to-day." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	little	reaction—no	more.	It	was	worth	it."	He	then	proceeded	where	he	had broken	off	on	the	preceding	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	 remains	 only	 to	 tell	 you	 how	 I	 found	 myself	 caught	 up	 in	 your	 sad story.	It	had	not	occurred	to	you	to	wonder?" </p>

<p class="calibre1">"But,	 none	 the	 less,	 you	 will	 want	 to	 know,	 Sir	 Walter.	 Our	 common	 friend, Colonel	Vane,	put	the	first	thought	in	my	head.	He	laid	the	train	to	which	I	set</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	match	so	well.	He	it	was	who	described	the	Grey	Room	very	exactly,	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment	 that	 I	 heard	 of	 the	 ancient	 carved	 furniture,	 I	 knew	 that	 he	 spoke	 of curios	 concerning	 which	 I	 already	 had	 heard.	 The	 name	 of	 Lennox	 completed the	clue,	for	that	had	already	stirred	memories	in	my	ancient	mind.	I	had	listened</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	my	father,	when	I	was	young,	telling	a	story	in	which	a	bed	and	chairs	and	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">gentleman	named	Lennox	 were	connected.	He	 spoke	of	an	 ancient	Italian	suite</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 three	 pieces,	 the	 work	 of	 craftsmen	 at	 Rome	 in	 the	 fifteenth	 century.	 It	 was papal	 furniture	 of	 the	 early	 Renaissance,	 well	 known	 to	 him	 as	 being	 in	 a Spanish	collection—a	hundred	and	fifty	years	ago	that	is	now—and	when	these</p>
<p class="calibre1">things	 came	 into	 the	 market,	 he	 rejoiced	 and	 hurried	 off	 to	 Valencia,	 where	 it was	to	be	sold.	For	he	was	even	such	a	man	as	your	grandfather—a	connoisseur</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 an	 enthusiastic	 collector.	 But,	 alas,	 his	 hopes	 were	 short-lived;	 he	 found</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a>himself	 in	 opposition	 to	 a	 deeper	 purse	 than	 his	 own,	 and	 it	 was	 Sir	 John Lennox,	not	my	father,	who	secured	the	bed	and	the	two	chairs	that	go	with	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These	things,	as	I	tell	you,	returned	to	my	recollection,	and,	remembering	them,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">guessed	myself	upon	the	right	track.	The	arms	of	the	Borgia,	and	the	successful</p>
<p class="calibre1">experiment	with	the	dog,	Prince,	proved	that	I	was	correct	in	guessing	where	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">poison	lay	hidden." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	 is	 impossible	 to	 express	 my	 sense	 of	 your	 amazing	 goodness,	 or	 my gratitude,	or	my	admiration	for	your	genius,"	declared	Sir	Walter;	but	the	other contradicted	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Genius	is	a	great	word	to	which	I	can	lay	no	claim.	I	have	done	nothing	at	all that	 you	 yourself	 might	 not	 have	 done,	 given	 the	 same	 knowledge.	 As	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1">gratitude,	 if	 indeed	 that	 is	 not	 too	 strong	 an	 expression	 also,	 you	 can	 show gratitude	in	a	very	simple	manner,	dear	friend.	I	am	a	practical,	old	man	and,	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	honest,	I	very	greatly	covet	the	Borgia	bed	and	chairs.	Now,	if	indeed	you	feel</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	I	am	not	asking	too	grand	a	favor—a	favor	out	of	all	keeping	with	my	good</p>
<p class="calibre1">offices	 on	 your	 behalf—then	 let	 me	 purchase	 the	 bed	 and	 chairs,	 and	 convey them	with	me	home	to	Rome.	It	is	seemly	that	they	should	return	to	Rome,	is	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">not?	 Rome	 would	 welcome	 them.	 I	 much	 desire	 to	 sleep	 in	 that	 bed—to	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	I	am	so	sure	Prince	Djem	lay	when	he	breathed	his	last.	Yes,	believe	me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	received	your	bed	as	a	gracious	present	from	Alexander	VI.	The	Borgia	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">generous	of	such	gifts." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	bed	and	chairs	are	yours,	my	dear	signor,	and	the	rest	of	the	contents	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Grey	Room,	also,	if	you	esteem	them	in	any	way." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Positively	I	could	not,	Sir	Walter." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Indeed	you	shall.	It	is	done,	and	leaves	me	greatly	your	debtor	still." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	be	it	so.	I	thank	you	from	the	bottom	of	my	heart.	Nor	will	I	say	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	oppress	me	with	such	extraordinary	generosity,	for	is	it	not	more	blessed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">give	than	receive?	Heavens	knows	what	dark	evils	the	bed	may	have	committed</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	course	of	its	career,	but	its	activities	are	at	an	end.	For	me	it	shall	bring	no more	than	honest	slumber.	But	the	mattress—no.	I	do	not	want	the	mattress.	That</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	be	a	nice	present	for	the	museum	of	your	Royal	College	of	Surgeons." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	week	later	the	old	man	was	sufficiently	rested,	and	he	returned	home,	taking</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	treasures	with	him.	But	he	did	not	depart	until	he	had	won	a	promise	that	Sir</p>
<p class="calibre1">Walter	and	Mary	would	visit	him	at	Rome	within	the	year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Experts	 again	 descended	 upon	 Chadlands,	 packed	 the	 source	 of	 tribulation</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	exceeding	care,	and	conveyed	it	to	London	for	examination.	Those	destined</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	make	the	inquiry	were	much	alive	to	their	perils,	and	took	no	risk. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a>Six	 weeks	 later	 letters	 passed	 between	 England	 and	 Rome,	 and	 Sir	 Walter wrote	to	Signor	Mannetti,	sending	such	details	as	he	was	able	to	furnish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	 thin,	 supple	 wire	 was	 found	 to	 run	 between	 the	 harmless	 flock	 of	 the mattress	 and	 the	 satin	 casing,"	 wrote	 Sir	 Walter.	 "Experiments	 showed	 that neither	the	stuffing	nor	the	outer	case	contained	any	harmful	substance.	But	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wire,	 of	 which	 fifty	 miles	 wound	 over	 the	 upper	 and	 lower	 surfaces	 of	 the mattress	under	its	satin	upholstery,	proved	infinitely	sensitive	to	heat,	and	gave</p>
<p class="calibre1">off,	or	ejected	at	tremendous	speed,	an	invisible,	highly	poisonous	matter	even	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 lower	 temperature	 than	 that	 of	 a	 normal	 human	 being.	 Insects	 placed	 upon	 it perished	in	the	course	of	a	few	hours,	and	it	destroyed	microscopic	life	and	fish</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 frogs	 in	 water	 at	 comparatively	 low	 temperatures,	 that	 caused	 the	 living organisms	 no	 inconvenience	 until	 portions	 of	 the	 wire	 were	 introduced.	 A	 cat died	 in	 eight	 minutes;	 a	 monkey	 in	 ten.	 No	 pain	 or	 discomfort	 marked	 the operation	 of	 the	 wire	 on	 unconscious	 creatures.	 They	 sank	 into	 death	 as	 into sudden	sleep,	and	examination	revealed	no	physical	effects	whatever.	The	wire	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	alloy,	and	the	constituent	metals	have	not	yet	been	determined;	but	it	is	not	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">amalgam,	 for	 mercury	 is	 absent.	 The	 wire	 contains	 thallium	 and	 helium	 as	 the spectroscope	shows;	but	its	awful	radioactivity	and	deadly	emanation	has	yet	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	explained.	The	chemical	experts	have	a	startling	theory.	They	suspect	there	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	new	element	here—probably	destined	to	occupy	one	of	the	last	unfilled	places</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 Periodic	 Table,	 which	 chronicles	 all	 the	 elements	 known	 to	 science. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chemical	 analysis	 fails	 to	 reach	 the	 radio-active	 properties,	 and	 for	 their examination	 the	 electroscope	 and	 spinthariscope	 are	 needful.	 With	 these	 the radio-chemists	 are	 at	 work.	 The	 wire	 melted	 at	 a	 lower	 temperature	 than	 lead, but	 melting	 did	 not	 destroy	 its	 potency.	 After	 cooling,	 the	 metal	 retained	 its properties	and	was	still	responsive,	as	before,	to	warmth.	But	experiment	shows</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 in	 a	 molten	 state,	 the	 metal	 of	 the	 wire	 increases	 in	 effect,	 and	 any	 living thing	 brought	 within	 a	 yard	 of	 it	 under	 this	 condition	 succumbs	 instantly.	 Its properties	 cannot	 be	 extracted,	 so	 far,	 from	 the	 actual	 composition	 of	 the	 wire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	prove	also	that	the	emanation	from	the	warmed	wire	is	exceedingly	subtle, </p>
<p class="calibre1">tenuous,	 and	 volatile.	 Save	 under	 conditions	 of	 super-heat,	 it	 only	 operates	 at two	feet	and	a	few	inches,	and	the	wire	naturally	grows	cold	very	quickly.	It	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost	as	light	as	aluminium.	A	gas	mask	does	not	arrest	the	poison;	indeed,	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">evidently	enters	a	body	through	the	nearest	point	offered	to	it	and	a	safe	shield</p>
<p class="calibre1">has	not	yet	been	discovered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 shall	 tell	 you	 more	 when	 we	 know	 more,"	 concluded	 Sir	 Walter.	 "But	 at present	 it	 looks	 as	 though	 your	 prophecy	 were	 correct,	 and	 that	 science	 is	 not going	to	get	at	the	bottom	of	the	horrible	secret	easily.	Dr.	Mannering	says	that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a>the	properties	of	the	elements	have	yet	to	be	fully	determined,	while	the	subject of	alloys	was	never	suspected	of	containing	such	secrets	as	may	prove	to	be	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">case.	If	more	there	is	to	learn,	you	shall	learn	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 his	 reply,	 Signor	 Mannetti	 declared	 that	 the	 Borgia	 bed	 continued	 to	 be	 a source	of	extreme	satisfaction	and	comfort	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As	 yet	 no	 vision	 has	 broken	 my	 slumbers,	 but	 I	 continue	 to	 hope	 that	 the Oriental	features	of	Sultan	Bajazet's	brother	may	presently	revisit	the	place	of	his taking	 off,	 and	 that	 Prince	 Djem	 will	 some	 night	 afford	 me	 the	 pleasure	 of	 a conversation.	How	much	might	we	tell	each	other	that	neither	of	us	knows! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As	 to	 the	 wire,	 my	 friend,	 I	 will	 explain	 to	 you	 how	 that	 was	 probably created	 and,	 right	 or	 wrong,	 there	 is	 nobody	 on	 this	 earth	 at	 present	 who	 can prove	my	theory	to	be	mistaken.	Be	sure	that	a	medieval	alchemist,	searching	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">vain	 for	 elixir	 vitae,	 or	 the	 philosopher's	 stone,	 chanced	 upon	 this	 infernal synthesis	 and	 fusion.	 For	 him,	 no	 doubt,	 it	 proved	 a	 philosopher's	 stone	 in earnest,	 for	 the	 Borgia	 always	 extended	 a	 generous	 hand	 to	 those	 who	 could assist	their	damnable	activities.	Transmutation—so	a	skilled	friend	assures	me—</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	now	proved	to	be	a	fact,	and	another	generation	will	be	able	perhaps	to	make</p>
<p class="calibre1">gold,	if	the	desire	for	that	accursed	mineral	continues	much	longer	to	dominate</p>
<p class="calibre1">mankind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Farewell	for	the	present.	Again	to	see	you	and	your	daughter	is	one	of	those</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleasures	lying	in	wait	for	me,	to	make	next	winter	a	season	of	gladness	rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	dismay.	But	do	not	change	your	minds.	One	must	keep	faith	with	a	man	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">eighty,	or	risk	the	possibilities	of	remorse." </p>
