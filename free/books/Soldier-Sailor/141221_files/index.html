<p class="calibre1">Stepping	out	of	the	airlock	behind	Reese,	Kane	was	amazed	by	the	weight	&amp; wetness	of	the	air.	He	could	make	out	the	odors	of	cut	grass,	honeysuckle	&amp;	ivy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Martian	night	was	falling	outside	the	dome	&amp;	he	sensed	clouds	forming	above him.	Rain	on	Mars.	Evenly	spaced	houses	surrounded	him,	covered	with	ivy	&amp; separated	by	rows	of	elephant	ears	&amp;	ferns.	The	intricacy	of	the	ecological planning	startled	him;	a	bee	floated	over	his	head	&amp;	somewhere	a	mockingbird whistled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sight	of	the	colonists	sitting	on	their	porches	in	the	sunset	filled	him	with	a mixture	of	nostalgia	&amp;	surrealist	horror.	They	smiled	&amp;	nodded	to	Kane	as	if	it had	been	days	instead	of	years	since	they’d	seen	a	stranger,	as	if	the	space program	still	existed	&amp;	Reese	was	once	more	in	uniform. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Reading	Ouspensky,	he	had	found	the	first	clue	to	the	strange	visions	that	spun around	the	lip	of	his	consciousness.	“Every	separate	human	life	is	a	moment	in the	life	of	some	great	being	which	lives	in	us.”	But	when	he	tried	for	a	more concrete	image	than	ships	&amp;	shadowy	figures	rising	from	the	ground,	it	melted away.	From	Campbell	Kane	learned	of	the	Pattern	of	the	Hero,	the	inexorable circle,	the	path	of	exile	&amp;	return.	For	an	instant	the	memories—if	that	was	what they	were—clarified.	Kane	saw	that	he	must	take	it	all	personally.	Then	it	was gone	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually	Curtis	asked	how	things	were	on	Earth	&amp;	Reese	framed	a	careful reply.	Kane	paid	little	attention	to	the	measured,	cautious	description	of	the	riots, the	famines,	the	plagues.	Instead	he	examined	Curtis,	the	governor	of	the	colony, with	care.	The	man	was	soft,	pallid,	mannered	in	his	speech.	Kane	asked	simple questions—limits	to	the	population,	energy	sources,	chains	of	command.	He found	Curtis’s	answers	evasive,	dismissive.	Kane	felt	the	vast	gulf	between himself	&amp;	the	earth	as	an	ache	inside	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p4"></a>*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	first	morning	on	Mars,	Reese	had	taken	him	to	the	ruins	of	the	native	city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kane	was	fascinated	by	the	enigma	of	the	Martian	holocaust—the	artifacts	of intelligence	assimilated	into	the	processes	of	nature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	no	bodies?”	Kane	asked,	scuffing	through	the	rings	of	ash,	sand	&amp;	boiled rock.	“They	should	have	mummified	when	the	water	went.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reese	shrugged,	the	motion	barely	discernible	through	his	bulky	suit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kane	wandered	off,	trying	to	picture	the	city	before	the	disaster.	Some	of	the walls	were	almost	intact,	blistered	&amp;	pitted,	but	recognizable,	while	on	all	sides there	was	only	rubble.	The	stone,	obviously	artificial,	was	indistinguishable	from the	surrounding	rocks.	It	formed	an	architecture	of	intersecting	lines,	with	the Druidic	power	of	Stonehenge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">At	dinner	he	sat	across	from	Curtis’s	wife	Molly.	She	was	tall,	dark,	full-breasted,	with	a	quality	of	listless	abstraction	that	Kane	found	compelling.	He desired	her	in	a	dark,	impersonal	way	that	was	none	the	less	intense.	As	for Curtis,	Kane	found	him	increasingly	officious,	dangerously	authoritative.	He identified	Curtis	with	his	uncle;	at	the	thought	the	taste	of	his	food	turned	sour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	mood	turned	chaotic	&amp;	violent	&amp;	he	held	his	fists	under	the	table	until	the worst	of	it	passed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	panel,”	his	uncle	said,	“is	circular,	about	35	cm	in	diameter,	studded	at irregular	but	frequent	intervals	with	PROMs.”	The	fluorescent	light	was	harsh	&amp; Kane’s	attention	wandered	toward	the	smog	&amp;	riot	torn	streets	outside	the window.	“At	least	three	of	these	chips	are	mutants,	and	are	responsible	for	the power	output	curves	on	this	chart.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kane	glanced	at	the	chart	&amp;	away	again,	despising	his	uncle,	the	broad	waxed desk,	his	own	poverty	&amp;	failure.	His	uncle’s	life	depended	on	his	staying	in business;	if	he	failed,	his	employees	would	tear	him	to	pieces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	have	to	get	those	chips	into	the	lab,”	his	uncle	said,	“or	we’ll	never	know</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p5"></a>why	they	perform	they	way	they	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	say	this	panel	is	dangerous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	the	hands	of	the	colonists,	yes.	It’s	been	ten	years	since	the	space	program was	terminated.	They	undoubtedly	need	resources	from	Earth,	if	they’re	even alive	at	all.	How	do	they	feel	about	Earth	after	we	cut	them	off?	Can	we	even hope	to	understand	them?	A	ship	powered	by	that	panel	is	a	weapon	pointed	at the	Earth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	walls	of	the	office	were	lined	with	renderings	of	yet	more	offices.	Kane	sat</p>
<p class="calibre1">&amp;	allowed	himself	to	be	manipulated.	Something	had	gone	out	of	him	during	his years	of	student	exile.	He	no	longer	had	the	will	to	resist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">On	their	second	trip	to	the	ruins,	Reese	took	Kane	into	the	central	underground complex.	The	entrance	was	small,	a	vivid	black	hole	in	the	orange	glow	of	the desert.	Kane	lowered	himself	after	Reese	&amp;	found	himself	on	a	steeply descending	ramp.	As	his	eyes	adjusted	to	their	flashlights	he	made	out	the circular	pit	to	his	left.	It	seemed	to	have	no	bottom.	The	ramp	curved	around	it	&amp; he	followed,	no	more	than	a	spectator,	just	as	he	had	been	in	grade	school, watching	on	TV	as	Reese	planted	the	US	flag	on	these	same	ruins	&amp;	turned	to wave	to	the	cameras. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	Reese	turned	off	the	ramp	&amp;	moved	between	tilted	slabs	of	rock	to	an	inner chamber.	Reese’s	hand	moved	&amp;	a	door	swung	open	from	the	wall.	Kane followed	him	inside.	The	door	closed	behind	them	&amp;	Kane	heard	the unmistakable	hiss	of	pressurized	air.	Inside	his	helmet	a	light	changed	from	red to	green.	Reese	took	off	his	helmet	&amp;	opened	an	inner	door.	Light	flowed	from the	walls	themselves	&amp;	Kane	turned	off	his	flash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	walls	were	made	of	the	same	artificial	stone	as	the	ruins	above,	lacking	all ornament.	Walking	into	the	room,	he	loosened	his	helmet	&amp;	set	it	on	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	chill	air	stung	his	cheeks	&amp;	made	him	wince.	Here	there	was	finally decoration,	a	low	relief	that	reminded	Kane	of	a	printed	circuit	board.	It	ran	from floor	to	ceiling	with	circular	protrusions	at	key	points,	but	no	visible	dials	or meters.	He	understood	the	chauvinism	of	such	an	expectation.	At	the	far	end	of the	room,	where	Reese	stood,	the	outlines	of	a	door	were	etched	into	solid	rock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	handle	or	indentation	marred	its	surface.	Kane	pressed	his	hand	to	it.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p6"></a>sensed	its	importance,	connected	it	instinctively	to	the	disappearance	of	the Martians,	but	could	not	guess	its	function.	It	did	not	respond	to	his	touch.	He turned	to	look	at	Reese.	“What	does	it	mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reese	put	his	helmet	back	on	&amp;	started	for	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	a	fragment	of	melody	on	a	tape	loop:	clear,	high	voices	in	a	minor	key, without	a	message,	offering	only	coloration,	a	distortion	in	his	ability	to	see	the world.	Or	like	a	flickering	at	the	edges	of	his	vision	that	seemed	to	be	the	curves</p>
<p class="calibre1">&amp;	angles	of	fourth	dimensional	space.	Behind	it	a	sense	of	alien	personality, lurking.	The	ghosts	of	the	Martian	builders? </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kane	wandered	barefoot	through	the	city	under	the	dome.	It	was	a	quiet	suburb painted	by	Magritte,	too	Uniform,	too	clearly	defined,	too	obviously	existing	in	a vacuum	The	grass	under	his	feet	was	a	rich	green,	round-bladed	&amp;	moist.	The houses	were	like	those	in	the	poverty-level	neighborhoods	where	Kane	had grown	up,	after	his	father	died—vinyl	siding,	short	porches,	bushes	&amp;	trees growing	unhindered	against	the	walls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	edge	of	the	dome	he	watched	distorted	images	of	dust	storms	blow	past the	double	wall	of	yellowing	plastic.	High	C02	levels	&amp;	the	peak	heat	of afternoon	made	him	drowsy	&amp;	short	of	breath.	Reese	&amp;	Curtis	would	be	at	the ruins	all	day;	he	had	time	for	an	hour	or	two	of	sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Retracing	his	steps,	he	saw	Curtis’s	wife	Molly	on	the	porch	of	their	bungalow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	chill	of	prescience	went	through	him.	The	Presence	in	his	mind	sang	to	him	as he	climbed	the	single	step	&amp;	stood	in	front	of	her.	She	was	solid,	indifferent, languidly	sensual.	Kane’s	hands	were	clenched	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sit	down,”	she	said,	making	it	a	polite	question.	Kane	sat	facing	her.	He searched	her	face	for	information,	admiring	its	clean,	symmetrical	weight.	They had	reached	the	neutrality	of	afternoon.	He	could	not	avoid	looking	at	her breasts,	at	the	wide	brown	nipples	visible	through	her	T-shirt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’d	like	a	drink,”	she	said,	standing.	Kane	heard	the	power	of	command	she</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a>chose	not	to	use.	He	felt	her	matriarchal	strength,	her	link	with	the	rich,	darkly scented	vegetation	that	surrounded	them.	He	followed	her	into	the	gloom	of	a curtained	kitchen,	hearing	birds	cry	outside	in	an	eternal,	abstracted	spring.	He stopped	Molly	at	the	refrigerator	with	a	light	touch	on	the	arm.	As	she	turned	to him	her	eyes	lost	their	focus	&amp;	became	distant,	passive.	His	hands	went	to	her breasts,	thumbs	touching	her	nipples	as	she	gripped	his	elbows.	She	led	him	into her	bedroom,	a	dim,	fragrant	place	more	personal,	more	private	than	her	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Standing	across	the	bed	from	him	she	pulled	her	clothes	off	as	he	watched.	The aroma	of	her	body	drifted	to	him,	heavy,	sweet,	blatantly	sexual.	Kane	shut	his eyes,	unwilling	for	a	moment	to	continue	with	it:	his	internal	struggles,	his helplessness	before	his	own	sexual	urgings,	the	climax	inevitably	empty compared	to	the	ritual	preceding	it.	As	their	bodies	merged,	Molly	astride	him, her	hands	on	his	wrists,	Kane	felt	the	violence	rise	within	him.	With	effort	he delayed	his	ejaculation	until	Molly	had	satisfied	herself;	by	that	time	he	had become	detached	from	his	own	passion.	He	spasmed	quickly	&amp;	they	lay	together in	the	heat	of	the	drowning	afternoon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kane	had	been	amazed	by	Reese’s	easy	acceptance	of	his	uncle’s	offer.	Clearly Reese	had	ulterior	motives;	Kane	had	no	desire	to	learn	them.	From	this understanding	came	a	kind	of	mutual	respect,	or	at	least	silence.	Reese	did	not ask	Kane	to	justify	his	part	in	the	scenario,	a	scenario	that	seemed	to	point	to both	their	deaths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reese	claimed	to	have	translated	the	Martian	engravings	during	the	ten	years he’d	spent	on	Earth,	an	involuntary	furlough	caused	by	the	failure	of	the	space program.	Kane	eventually	began	to	believe	the	translations	were	genuine,	but knew	Reese	was	holding	something	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Reese	assembled	the	entire	population	of	the	colony	in	their	conference	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kane	sat	on	the	back	row	with	a	piece	of	string,	idly	weaving	cat’s	cradles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Today,”	Reese	said,	“I	took	the	preliminary	dictionary	to	the	ruins,	with	Curtis’s help.	We	were	able	to	piece	together	a	long	section	from	one	of	the	engravings.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kane	wondered	if	Curtis	should	have	been	involved.	Curtis	was	clever	&amp; authoritarian	&amp;	the	less	he	knew	the	better.	Kane	sensed	a	primal	conflict</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>between	himself	&amp;	Curtis,	building	toward	a	violent	release. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reese	moved	through	the	translation,	pausing	frequently	to	fill	in	gaps,	suggest explanations,	grapple	with	alien	concepts.	Kane	found	himself	moved,	almost against	his	will,	by	the	story.	He	gazed	out	the	windows	of	the	auditorium, seeing	past	the	verdant	languor	of	the	trees	to	the	desert	beyond.	Always	poor, always	dry,	feeding	a	few	vastly	alien	creatures	just	enough	to	keep	them	in perpetual	warfare.	Reese	offered	no	physical	description	of	the	Martians,	&amp; Kane	could	only	conceive	of	them	in	grotesque,	cartoon	terms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	anything,	he	thought,	they	must	have	been	like	Reese.	Large,	powerful,	but carrying	an	aura	of	defeat	&amp;	doom.	What	culture	could	have	reached	the	peak that	Reese	described	&amp;	left	so	little	behind?	A	single	devastated	city,	the	last refuge	of	the	artists	&amp;	scientists	fleeing	the	final	war.	Where	they	waited	for	the catastrophe	of	their	own	making	to	wipe	the	oxygen	from	the	air,	boil	away	the water,	lacerate	&amp;	blister	the	very	stone.	The	translation	made	compelling	poetry, full	of	strange	pairings	&amp;	cryptic	emphases.	In	it	Kane	saw	again	the	equanimity that	moved	him	so	strongly	in	Molly	&amp;	Reese. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">They	had	given	Kane	his	own	house	&amp;	Molly	came	to	him	there.	The	sexuality of	their	attraction	had	withered	&amp;	Kane	had	come	to	see	in	her	the	power	&amp; competence	he	saw	in	Reese.	His	own	nature,	prone	to	extremes	of	apathy	&amp; violence,	was	in	perfect	opposition.	In	the	darkness	they	sat	on	Kane’s	bed without	touching.	As	Kane	listened,	she	drew	him	into	the	power	struggles	of	the colonists.	Without	hesitation	or	encouragement	from	him	she	talked	of	the	panel, taking	his	knowledge	of	it	for	granted.	He	wondered	if	she	took	his	motives	for granted	too,	or	if	she	even	cared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Curtis	wanted	the	panel	to	power	the	generators	of	the	colony,	to	expand,	to solidify.	Kane	had	heard	the	arguments	before,	on	another	world;	more	or	less, they	were	the	same	as	his	uncle’s.	Plodding,	methodical,	a	denial	of	impulse	or creativity.	Molly—&amp;	others—wanted	the	panel	to	power	a	ship	that	could	reach Jupiter,	Saturn,	beyond.	Kane	listened	in	silence,	allowing	Molly	to	engulf	him with	her	dreams,	the	way	she’d	engulfed	him	earlier	with	her	body.	She	knew	as if	by	instinct	how	to	reach	him,	tantalizing	him	with	the	inhuman	beauty	of	the outer	planets. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>Molly	&amp;	the	void	of	space	were	linked	by	the	same	relationship	as	Reese	&amp;	the ruins.	In	Reese’s	case	it	was	a	destiny	of	annihilation,	the	merger	of	his	lost career	with	the	fate	of	the	lost	Martians.	For	Molly	it	was	something	more	vital, but	still	a	gesture	of	despair.	Both	were	prisoners,	deprived	of	the	frontiers	they needed	by	an	accident	of	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	Molly	left,	Kane	took	the	pistol	out	of	the	bottom	of	his	flight	bag	&amp;	stared at	it.	The	voices	sang	in	his	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kane,	Molly	&amp;	Reese	went	out	to	the	shipyard.	Here	the	remains	of	the	big	ships that	had	brought	the	colonists	from	Earth	lay	in	shining	disarray.	Broken	down	in orbit,	brought	piece	by	piece	to	the	surface	in	shuttles,	converted	into	furniture, tools,	decorations.	What	was	left	over	stretched	for	five	hundred	meters	across the	pale	sand.	Kane	walked	through	huge	rings	of	metal,	lightly	touching	them with	gloved	hands.	It	was	an	edited	&amp;	polished	scrap	yard,	free	from	the violence	of	oxygen	&amp;	rain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“From	this	you’re	going	to	build	a	ship?”	Kane	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	still	one	ship	in	orbit,”	Molly	said.	“Not	that	we	can	get	to	it,	of	course. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	yes,	between	it	and	the	parts	here	and	the	panel,	we	could	build	a	ship.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If,”	Kane	said,	“Curtis	were	not	governor	of	this	colony.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	answer.	Kane	thought	about	Jupiter.	Massive,	inhuman,	constructed on	a	different	principle	than	Earth	or	Mars.	With	moons	like	worlds,	floating under	the	huge	red	Eye.	He	found	his	breath	coming	short.	His	hands	tingled	&amp; he	heard	a	roaring	in	his	ears.	It	didn’t	seem	important.	Reese	called	his	name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kane	tried	to	answer	but	couldn’t	seem	to	get	his	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hypoxia,”	Reese	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Molly	was	standing	behind	him.	“Pressure’s	all	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	the	mixture,”	Reese	said.	“Look	out…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kane	sat	down.	He	was	aware	that	Curtis	was	trying	to	kill	him,	gently	&amp;	from	a distance.	Reese	disconnected	his	own	tank	&amp;	traded	it	for	Kane’s.	In	the	moment</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>of	the	exchange,	without	air	for	a	second	or	two,	Kane	had	a	particularly	intense occurrence	of	the	vision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	mind	gradually	cleared.	Molly	was	driving	them	back	to	the	base,	Reese lying	quietly,	living	off	the	air	inside	his	suit.	Eyes	closed,	Reese	whispered:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	talk	about	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Molly	showed	Kane	where	the	panel	attached	to	the	city	power	grid,	nestled	in wiring	like	a	flat	egg.	Kane	had	begun	to	feel	the	pressure	of	time	&amp;	wanted	as many	pieces	of	the	puzzle	within	reach	as	possible.	Soon	he	would	have	to	make his	decision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">After	sunset	Kane	sat	on	his	porch	&amp;	watched	the	rain.	It	fell	almost	hesitantly, without	thunder	to	announce	it	or	wind	to	carry	it.	Puddles	of	light	from neighboring	windows	illuminated	the	grass	&amp;	trees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reese’s	suit	was	missing.	Kane	did	not	doubt	he’d	gone	to	the	ruins.	Curtis	had noticed	as	well.	Kane	felt	the	wheel	turn	under	him,	exposing	a	new	segment	of the	Circle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">When	they	stole	the	ship	from	Canaveral,	with	the	help	of	his	uncle,	Kane	had known	that	Reese	was	following	some	elaborate	purpose	of	his	own.	Without him	Kane	would	have	been	helpless;	Kane	himself	seemed	to	make	little difference	to	Reese	beyond	his	ability	to	provide	the	ship.	Still	Reese	had	taught him	to	navigate,	led	him	through	rigorous	physical	training,	controlled	the mission	from	the	first.	Now	Kane	sensed	a	shift	in	the	power	balance.	His	own time	had	come,	his	phase,	his	moment.	Or	perhaps	Reese	had	simply	diverged, entered	the	final	stage	of	his	own	compulsion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kane	had	rejected	the	idea	when	it	first	came	to	him.	But	it	continued	to	haunt him.	He	thought	of	Reese,	out	in	the	ruins,	his	labors,	his	feats	of	courage	&amp; strength.	He	thought	of	the	Circle	&amp;	the	great	fourth	dimensional	being	outside time.	Of	the	salt	spray	&amp;	the	shining	cup	&amp;	the	others	who	had	come	before	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	he	knew. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>*</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	darkness	Kane	lost	sense	of	his	own	body.	His	limbs	seemed	to	shrink	&amp; swell	as	if	in	a	fever	dream.	Over	it	all	he	smelled	the	stale	salt	of	the	sea	&amp;	high harmonies	rang	in	his	ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	dressed	in	darkness	&amp;	tucked	the	pistol	into	his	jeans.	Out	under	the	dome the	rain	had	ended.	The	stars	were	smears	of	brightness	behind	the	plastic.	The lights	flickered	as	Kane	switched	over	to	the	auxiliary	generator,	but	stayed	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	disconnected	the	panel	with	a	few	precise	gestures,	hampered	by	the	pressure of	the	pistol	in	his	waistband. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	sat	in	the	wet	grass	outside	Curtis	&amp;	Molly’s	house	until	the	lights	went	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Curtis	finally	emerged	&amp;	headed	for	the	air	lock.	Suited	up,	the	panel	in	one hand,	the	pistol	dangling	from	the	other,	Kane	followed	him	across	the	desert. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking	huge	strides	in	the	reduced	gravity	he	slowly	gained	on	Curtis’s headlamp,	now	almost	halfway	to	the	ruins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">At	night	the	desert	became	an	ocean.	Freckles	of	white	froth	sprayed	the	dune tops.	Imaginary	ships	sailed	off	its	edge.	The	desert	seemed	to	exist	in	all dimensionalities,	to	form	a	link	or	stepping	stone	to	the	incomprehensible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Curtis.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Curtis	turned,	startled,	&amp;	Kane	shot	him	through	the	helmet.	Curtis’s	face exploded	&amp;	a	fine	spray	of	blood	hissed	through	shattered	glass	as	the	body crumpled	to	the	ground.	Kane’s	hand	throbbed	slightly	from	the	kick	of	the	gun in	the	low	pressure.	He	tossed	the	weapon	into	the	dirt	beside	Curtis’s	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carrying	the	panel	like	a	shield	in	his	left	arm,	he	noticed	the	voices	had	become quieter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	he	was	into	the	central	pit,	he	had	little	trouble	finding	his	way.	He	went through	the	airlock	&amp;	sat	down	beside	Reese. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	much	have	you	figured	out?”	Reese	asked,	not	looking	around.	His	hands rested	on	the	carved	circles	as	if	they	were	dials	&amp;	knobs.	Perhaps	they	were. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>“Most	of	it,”	Kane	said.	“I	just	came	to	say	goodbye.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reese	turned,	nodded.	“You	took	the	panel.	Have	you	decided	what	to	do	with it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	doorframe	now	surrounded	a	shimmering,	luminous	area	of	force.	Rainbow colors	ran	off	it,	reminding	Kane	of	an	oil	slick	or	a	huge	fire	opal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will	you	be	able	to	come	back?”	Kane	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	care	to,	either	way,”	Reese	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	luck.”	Kane	reached	up	from	where	he	sat	&amp;	took	Reese’s	hand.	He	felt the	link	between	them	that	had	never	been	realized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reese	nodded	&amp;	stepped	through	the	shimmering	gateway,	across	billions	of miles	of	nothingness	to	a	new	world,	just	as	the	last	of	the	Martian	builders	had, while	the	city	above	was	pounded	into	rubble.	Kane	continued	to	sit	&amp;	stare	at the	shifting	pattern.	At	last	he	got	up	&amp;	stood	beside	the	opening,	hesitating.	He stuck	one	finger	into	the	pulsing	glow,	felt	the	summer	warmth	beyond.	And then	he	turned	&amp;	walked	away	from	it,	the	colors	fading	to	chilly	stone	behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Passing	the	nadir	of	descent,	Kane	felt	the	insistent	tug	of	the	Return,	a conceptual	rebirth.	His	pattern	nearly	finished,	he	thought	of	the	others	who	had walked	it.	Most	of	all	Jason,	the	obsessed	&amp;	broken	sailor,	whose	creaking	ship</p>
<p class="calibre1">&amp;	brine-scented	voyage	had	haunted	his	dreams.	Of	Percival,	the	soldier maddened	by	his	realization	of	the	Pattern,	ending	his	days	in	futile	subservience to	a	nameless	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kane	knew	that	each	of	them,	the	single	being	they	made	up	&amp;	the	single	act they	performed	outside	time,	would	continue.	To	each	of	them	was	a	unique moment,	a	contribution,	a	change.	Kane	knew	what	his	had	to	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Molly	was	asleep	&amp;	he	was	relieved	that	she	did	not	wake	up	when	he	entered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	voices	silent	now,	Kane	set	the	panel	beside	her	bed.	Her	Pattern	was	yet	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>come;	Kane	wondered	if	Odysseus	would	sing	to	her	on	her	voyages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kane’s	point	of	view	had	begun	to	shimmer	&amp;	bleed,	like	the	gate	that	Reese	had used.	Only	a	force	of	will	held	his	perceptions	together	as	he	suited	up	&amp;	began the	walk	back	to	his	ship,	back	to	the	Earth,	back	to	his	kingdom. </p>
