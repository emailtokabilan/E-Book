<p class="calibre1">This	eBook	contains	two	of	my	previously	published	short	stories.	“Miss Tennessee” </p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared	in	The	Land-Grant	College	Review	#2	while	“The	Cryerer”	appeared as	One</p>
<p class="calibre1">Story	#8.	I	am	grateful	to	the	editors	of	both	journals	for	originally	publishing these</p>
<p class="calibre1">stories.	I	have	had	a	few	pieces	published	elsewhere	(and	many	more	remain	on my	hard</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p4"></a><b class="calibre3">MISS	TENNESSEE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	loved	the	little	guy	from	the	day	she	brought	him	home.	She	carried	him wrapped	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sweatshirt	from	the	shelter	at	the	corner	where	she’d	been	saying	for	months	she was</p>
<p class="calibre1">going	to	go.	She	set	him	down	on	the	hardwood	floor	and	he	clipped	around	like a	fawn	-</p>
<p class="calibre1">-	clip,	clip	—	looking	through	doorways	and	carefully	eyeing	us	both.	He	was tiny	but	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	strong.	He	was	muscular	and	sleek,	like	a	miniature	greyhound,	and	we	both watched</p>
<p class="calibre1">intently	as	he	clipped	around,	soldiering	things	out	and	whining	under	his	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Tennessee	looked	at	me	and	smiled	and	said:	“Well	honey?	What	do	you think?”	And	I	told	her:	“I	love	the	little	guy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	never	really	my	dog.	He	was	more	like	my	step-dog,	but	together	we named	him	Steve.	We	thought	it	was	funny,	giving	a	dog	a	man’s	name	like	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">fit,	like	Miss	Tennessee,	which	I	started	just	to	tease	her	about	being	full-grown and	long-legged	and	pretty,	but	in	a	tomboyish	way	that	made	it	both	absolutely ridiculous	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">absolutely	plausible	that	she	had	ever	been	Miss	Anything.	It	always	made	her swallow	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p5"></a>grin.	Steve’s	name,	on	the	other	hand,	made	it	sound	like	he	wasn’t	a	dog	at	all, but	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	man.	Miss	Tennessee	often	called	him	that:	the	little	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Steve	liked	me	okay	but	he	loved	Miss	Tennessee.	With	me	it	was	man	things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	he	got	snipped	or	when	he	was	stung	by	bees,	down	there,	in	grass	that came	up	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	chin,	he	would	come	sit	by	me,	hoping	I’d	understand.	With	her,	it	was everything</p>
<p class="calibre1">else.	When	she	took	a	bath,	he	stood	with	his	paws	on	the	side	of	the	tub,	and when	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">went	someplace	he	couldn’t	go	he	stood	where	he	last	saw	her	and	waited.	If	she went</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	a	store	and	left	us	together	in	the	car,	he	stood	with	his	paws	on	the dashboard, </p>
<p class="calibre1">waiting	and	crying	and	looking	at	me	like	maybe	I	was	to	blame. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	tough	in	his	own	way.	He	growled	at	people	passing	by	and	people who</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t	give	him	what	he	wanted.	It	was	a	deep	and	sincere	growl,	if	not	loud	or	at all</p>
<p class="calibre1">intimidating,	based	as	it	was	on	anatomy	smaller	than	a	cat’s.	Like	a	cat,	he sometimes</p>
<p class="calibre1">brought	home	dead	things.	He	brought	Miss	Tennessee	chipmunks	and	mice	and assorted</p>
<p class="calibre1">birds,	which	I	buried	—	in	his	view	and	with	much	ceremony	—	in	the	soft,	gray</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p6"></a>dirt	under</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	porch. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">His	confidence	was	not	unshakable,	however.	He	was	aware	of	certain limitations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes,	when	furious,	like	at	me	or	at	Miss	Tennessee’s	sister	or	Miss Tennessee’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">sister’s	dog	—	an	Alsatian	monster	who	sometimes	came	over	and	hoarded	all the	little</p>
<p class="calibre1">man’s	bones	—	he	knew	better	than	to	strike	directly	so	he	would	bite	something else</p>
<p class="calibre1">instead.	He’d	bite	the	arm	of	the	couch	or	a	pillow	or	the	little	blue	rug	he’d learned	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">pee	on	and	he’d	snap	them	around	with	his	head	—	really	killing	them	—	his	big marble</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes	locked	on	the	real	target.	It	was	like	he	was	thinking:	“This	is	you.	You fucker.	You</p>
<p class="calibre1">fink.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes	we	spoke	for	him.	“This	is	you,	Prince.	You	fucker.	You	fink,”	I’d say</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	Steve	pretended	to	bite	Miss	Tennessee’s	sister’s	monster	Alsatian,	and	we would</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	laugh.	There	was	always	something	Steve	seemed	to	be	thinking,	and	we were	always</p>
<p class="calibre1">saying	it	for	him.	When	we	ate	breakfast	in	the	living	room,	he’d	get	up	on	his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a>hind	legs</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	look	at	the	fruit	and	toast	laid	out	on	the	coffee	table.	It	was	creepy	to	look	at, like</p>
<p class="calibre1">maybe	he	really	was	a	little	man,	weaving	back	and	forth	like	a	dancer.	Miss Tennessee</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	nudge	me	with	her	foot	to	make	sure	I	was	watching. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Look	at	the	little	man,”	she’d	whisper.	“He’s	going:	Where’s	mine?	Where’s my</p>
<p class="calibre1">toast.”	And	I’d	say:	“I	don’t	see	why	you	guys	get	all	the	fruit	and	toast	when you’re	both</p>
<p class="calibre1">already	so	big.	Look	at	me.	I’m	tiny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Steve	would	catch	on	that	we	were	talking	about	him	and	he’d	run	around	the table	and	I’d	play	with	him	a	little,	batting	him	back	and	forth	while	he	growled and</p>
<p class="calibre1">snapped. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,”	Miss	Tennessee	would	say.	“He’s	going:	You’re	not	so	tough.	You’re not</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	tough.”	And	I’d	say:	“Fuck	you.	You	fucker.	You	fink.”	And	we’d	laugh	until Miss</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tennessee	had	to	go	take	a	shower. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>Miss	Tennessee	worked	eight	to	five	in	a	pediatrician’s	office	and	I	taught school, </p>
<p class="calibre1">although	not	in	the	summers.	I	usually	stuck	around	her	house	after	she	left	for the	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	wore	smocks	covered	with	balloons	and	clowns	that	made	little	boys	want	to marry</p>
<p class="calibre1">her,	and	I	would	kiss	her	goodbye	on	the	porch. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	mornings,	I	sat	in	the	backyard	and	let	the	sun	beat	on	my	face	and watched</p>
<p class="calibre1">Steve	march	around.	In	the	afternoons	I	ran	errands.	If	I	was	feeling	ambitious,	I would</p>
<p class="calibre1">cook	up	a	pot	of	gumbo	with	ducks	my	brother	had	hunted	and	killed	near	the lakes	north</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	city.	It	would	surprise	Miss	Tennessee	when	she	got	home,	which	was usually</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	six,	seven	if	it	was	a	bad	day,	and	eight	if	she	went	to	aerobics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	home	later	and	we	would	fight	over	my	mentioning	that	I	had	wondered where	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	and	if	she	was	all	right.	She	would	say	I	didn’t	trust	her	and	we	would argue.	Later</p>
<p class="calibre1">we’d	sit	in	bed,	batting	Steve	around,	and	she	would	nudge	me	with	her	foot. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Look.	He’s	going:	You’ve	gotta	trust	people	silly	man.”	And	I’d	say:	“People that	want	to	be	trusted	should	learn	to	use	the	telephone.	I	can’t.	My	paws	are</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>too	damn</p>
<p class="calibre1">tiny.”	And	we’d	laugh	until	we	kissed	and	then	we’d	laugh	again	before	we	fell asleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">One	night	Miss	Tennessee	was	very	late.	I	was	in	bed	but	not	asleep.	Steve bounced	off</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	bed	like	a	spring	and	met	her	at	the	door.	He	spun	around	the	bedroom	—	up on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bed,	down	on	the	floor	—	in	tighter	and	tighter	circles.	Miss	Tennessee	didn’t say</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything.	She	just	got	undressed,	draping	her	clothes	over	the	open	doors	of	the wardrobe. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,”	I	said	as	Steve	gnawed	on	a	piece	of	rawhide	that	he’d	placed	next	to my</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand	so	he	could	pretend	he	was	gnawing	on	me.	Miss	Tennessee	looked	over her</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulder	as	she	pulled	on	a	pair	of	boxer	shorts:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Look	honey,”	she	said.	“He’s	going:	Better	be	careful	with	that	hand,	tough guy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	gonna	bite	it	off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	down	at	Steve. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,”	she	said.	“He’s	going:	Go	back	to	your	own	house	before	I	bite	your hand	off,	you	fink.”	She	was	smiling	but	I	didn’t	smile	back.	“Honey,	you	heard him,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	said	as	she	got	into	bed.	“Don’t	worry.	I’ll	call	you	tomorrow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">I	drove	home	wishing	I	hadn’t	said	anything.	My	apartment	was	a	mess.	I	was only	there	enough	to	mess	it	up	but	not	enough	to	clean.	Clothes	hung	over	the furniture</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	the	bed	wasn’t	made.	I	sat	for	a	while,	thumbing	through	mail	and	bills	and magazines.	I	folded	my	clothes	across	the	back	of	a	chair	and	lay	there	wide awake, </p>
<p class="calibre1">thinking	about	what	Steve	had	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">I	spent	the	next	morning	cleaning.	I	sorted	my	clothes	between	closet	and hamper, </p>
<p class="calibre1">emptied	the	refrigerator,	and	even	thinned	out	my	medicine	cabinet	and	the bookshelf</p>
<p class="calibre1">covered	with	small	piles	of	change	and	tiny	receipts	that	appeared	to	be	blank except	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">raised	bumps.	Miss	Tennessee	called	in	the	afternoon. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	just	wanted	to	make	sure	you	were	coming	over	tonight,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>“You	don’t	have	plans?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	not	silly.	Are	you	coming	or	not?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	yourself	in,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">I	spent	the	rest	of	the	afternoon	running	errands	so	I	could	cook	dinner,	to show</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	I	was	sorry.	When	I	got	to	her	house	she	wasn’t	home.	Steve	went	berserk, running</p>
<p class="calibre1">circles	around	the	room	and	across	the	furniture.	He	seemed	glad	to	see	me.	I	sat in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">backyard	for	a	while,	watching	him	blink	into	the	sun	before	starting	dinner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">slept	on	the	bed,	I	made	a	stew	with	parts	of	a	deer	my	brother	had	hunted	and killed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Tennessee	was	late,	even	for	aerobics	night.	She	came	into	the	kitchen and</p>
<p class="calibre1">kissed	me	on	the	neck	as	I	warmed	a	loaf	of	French	bread	in	the	oven. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	know	you	were	going	to	cook,”	she	said,	sniffing	the	air	around	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>“You</p>
<p class="calibre1">smell	funny,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	in	the	yard.	I’ll	take	a	shower	before	we	eat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	got	out	of	the	shower,	she	was	sitting	on	the	couch.	Steve	sat	on	the floor</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	front	of	her,	staring	up	in	worship. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	don’t	we	eat	in	the	living	room,”	I	shouted	as	I	got	dressed.	“Fine!”	she shouted	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">After	I’d	shaved	and	combed	my	hair,	I	loaded	a	few	bowls	with	stew	and lengths</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	French	bread	and	knifefuls	of	butter.	I	carried	them	into	the	living	room	and sat	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	couch	next	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	honey,”	she	said.	“Everything	smells	so	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">We	ate	and	watched	Jeopardy,	calling	out	the	answers	when	we	knew	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Steve</p>
<p class="calibre1">kept	his	nose	up	in	the	air,	sniffing,	and	he	spent	a	lot	of	time	wobbling	on	his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>back	legs</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying	to	see	what	we	were	eating. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,”	Miss	Tennessee	said,	nudging	me.	“He’s	going:	Silly	man.	You	smell like	wood.”	Steve	sniffed	around	my	feet.	“Just	like	wood.	Like	all	silly	old men.”	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	to	see	if	I’d	dropped	some	bread	on	the	carpet.	“Not	like	Mommy’s friend	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">astronaut.	Not	at	all.	Mommy’s	astronaut	smells	like	TV.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Silly?”	I	said	in	the	way	I	had	of	talking	when	I	was	talking	for	Steve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“People</p>
<p class="calibre1">smelling	like	TV.	Now	that’s	silly.	I	know	that	and	my	brain’s	no	bigger	than	a walnut.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,”	Miss	Tennessee	said,	nudging	me	again.	“He’s	going:	He	does.	I’ve smelled	him.	He	smells	like	shampoo	and	baby	aspirins	and	electrical	fire.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	to	Miss	Tennessee,	who	was	still	smiling	at	Steve.	“There	aren’t	any astronauts	in	this	part	of	the	country,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,”	she	said,	nudging.	“He’s	going:	That’s	what	I	thought,	too,	but	I smelled</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>him.	I	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	our	plates	into	the	kitchen.	I	could	still	hear	Miss	Tennessee’s	voice from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	other	room.	“Yeees.	Yeees.	The	little	man	doesn’t	like	wood	does	he?	The little	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">likes	astronauts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">I	put	the	dishes	in	soapy	water	and	told	Miss	Tennessee	I	was	going	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alright,”	she	said,	shaking	Steve	like	a	puppet.	He	looked	at	me	and	squinted. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Look.	The	little	man’s	going	to	miss	you,”	she	said.	“Say,	I’m	going	to	miss you,”	she	told	him.	But	Steve	didn’t	say	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">On	my	way	home	I	stopped	and	bought	beer.	In	my	immaculate	apartment,	I	sat in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">chair	in	front	of	the	television	and	propped	the	beer	next	to	me.	I	flipped	through channels	and	drank.	I	watched	some	sports	wrap-ups	and	bits	of	a	beauty pageant	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">teenagers,	although	this	only	made	me	restless. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">An	astronaut?	Was	he	really	an	astronaut?	Where	had	she	met	an	astronaut? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Are</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>there	still	astronauts?	The	people	in	the	shuttles,	are	they	technically	astronauts? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	opened</p>
<p class="calibre1">another	beer	and	tried	to	decide	whether	I	was	upset	because	Miss	Tennessee was	seeing</p>
<p class="calibre1">somebody	else	or	because	that	somebody	else	was	an	astronaut	or	because	he maybe</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t	an	astronaut	but	had	said	he	was	and	she	believed	him.	Or	maybe	it	was because</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	smelled	like	TV.	I	opened	another	beer	and	smelled	my	hand.	Like	skin	and bones	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">beer.	Like	deer	and	French	bread.	Not	at	all	like	wood.	I	grabbed	another	beer and	took	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	me	to	the	shower. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	hear	from	Miss	Tennessee	for	days.	For	more	than	a	week.	I	began looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward	to	school.	I	kept	busy	with	errands	and	lesson	plans	and	some	new books	I	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">expected	to	teach.	Early	Saturday	I	joined	my	brother	near	the	lakes	north	of	the city	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoot	at	ducks	and	deer.	I	tried	not	to	think	about	Steve	or	astronauts	or	Miss Tennessee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	night	I	ordered	pornographic	movies	on	pay-for-view,	which	were	edited	for such</p>
<p class="calibre1">purpose	and	shot	at	odd	angles,	and	wondered	what	the	PTA	would	think	of	me now.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>imagined	Miss	Tennessee	with	the	astronaut,	drinking	cocktails	made	with	Tang and</p>
<p class="calibre1">having	multiple	orgasms	in	weightless	environments.	Weightlessness	outside	of deep</p>
<p class="calibre1">space,	I	knew,	was	impossible,	but	then	I	hadn’t	known	we	still	had	astronauts.	I tried	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	think	about	these	things. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Tennessee	called	while	I	sat	in	the	driveway	outside	my	apartment.	I	was considering	the	latticework	on	the	porch	of	the	big	house	where	my	landlord lived	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinking	about	all	these	things	anyway.	I	didn’t	answer	the	portable	phone	I	kept with	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	case	she	called,	but	went	inside	to	listen	to	the	message.	She	sounded	as	sweet as	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">be. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	have	you	been	silly	man,”	she	said.	“When	you	get	done	sulking,	give us</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	call.”	I	was	nervous	about	who	us	might	include	but	I	called	back	anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,”	she	said	when	she	heard	it	was	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	little	man	misses	you,”	she	said.	I	could	hear	her	talking	away	from	the phone.	“Yeees.	Isn’t	that	right?”	she	was	saying. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	you?	Do	you	miss	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Well	of	course,	silly.	Why	do	you	thinking	I’m	calling	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	I	said.	“Is	everything	alright?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine,”	Miss	Tennessee	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“With	us,	I	mean.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“You	shouldn’t	worry	so	much.	Now	are	you	coming	over	or	not?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	about	it	for	a	minute,	although	I	knew	what	I	would	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,”	I	said.	I	could	hear	Miss	Tennessee	talking	as	I	hung	up.	“Yeees,”	she was</p>
<p class="calibre1">saying.	“Yeees.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	a	shower	and	made	the	bed.	I	combed	my	hair	and	shaved.	I	thought about</p>
<p class="calibre1">shopping	for	something	to	cook,	or	maybe	for	something	for	Steve,	but	decided to	go</p>
<p class="calibre1">straight	over.	She	met	me	at	the	door.	Steve	bounced	back	and	forth	behind	her and</p>
<p class="calibre1">jumped	up	at	my	knees. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	she	said.	“We	missed	you.	See,	he’s	going:	We	missed	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">She	put	her	arms	around	me	and	kissed	me	on	the	neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	missed	you,	too,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	lay	in	bed,	Steve	chewing	on	a	deer	hoof	between	us	—	not	the	pet	store kind	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	I’d	gotten	from	my	brother	—	Miss	Tennessee	nudged	me	with	her	foot. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>“Look,”	she	said.	“He’s	going:	Mmm.	This	tastes	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Very	good,”	I	said,	rolling	over	on	my	side	to	look	at	Miss	Tennessee’s	grin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	thinking:	This	tastes	better	than	ever.	Better	than	I	remembered.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	going:	I’ll	eat	it	all	and	then	I’ll	be	huge,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“As	big	as	you	guys,	with	all	your	fruit	and	toast,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“If	it	only	lasted	longer.	This	will	be	gone	in	no	time.”	Miss	Tennessee	pressed her	body	against	mine	leaving	just	enough	space	between	our	legs	for	Steve. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	going:	Hey.	Tough	guy.	I	hope	there’s	more	where	this	came	from.”	I pulled	her	closer	to	me	and	kissed	her	on	the	forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">We	were	quiet	and	Steve	scraped	his	teeth	on	the	hoof	like	scissors	on	a	golf ball. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Tennessee	rubbed	the	soft	heel	of	her	foot	up	and	down	my	shin	under	the covers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,	honey,”	she	said.	“He’s	going:	Too	bad	it	doesn’t	last	as	long.	It’s	over way	too	quick.”	Her	voice	got	thin	and	dreamy	as	she	continued.	“I	mean	it</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>starts	and	it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">good	and	then	it	goes	for	awhile	but	then,	poof,	it’s	over	and	gone,	burned	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“As	quick	as	it	takes	to	make	a	phone	call,”	I	laughed.	“I	know	that	and	my brain’s	no	bigger	than	a	walnut.”	Miss	Tennessee	got	quiet.	She	pulled	away	a little, </p>
<p class="calibre1">rolled	over	on	her	back,	and	the	room	was	filled	with	the	sound	of	Steve’s scraping. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,”	she	said.	“He’s	going:	Really	I	hate	this	thing.	I’ve	got	to	bite	it.	I hate	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	somebody	who	gets	drunk	and	always	talks	too	loud.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">I	rolled	over	on	my	back	and	stared	at	the	ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Like	someone	who	thinks	she	can	do	anything	she	wants	and	pretend	it	never happened,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Like	someone	who	passes	out	and	snores,”	she	said,	sing-song,	smiling	at Steve. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Like	a	liar,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>“Like	someone	who	doesn’t	trust	people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Someone	who	doesn’t	let	people’s	feelings	get	in	the	way	of	her	fantasy worlds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“A	mama’s	boy,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“A	flirt.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Some	pussy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Crazy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Like	wood,”	she	said,	grinning. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,	look,”	I	said,	still	smiling,	putting	an	arm	across	Miss	Tennessee’s	bare stomach.	“He’s	saying:	Are	you	so	desperate	and	sad	and	stupid	that	you	really believed</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	guy	was	an	astronaut?	He’s	not.	I	smelled	him.	I	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Tennessee	shot	out	of	bed	and	glared	at	me.	As	she	stood	there,	bronze curls</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>falling	across	her	face,	I	looked	at	the	fine	lines	of	her	long	legs	and	hips,	her appendix</p>
<p class="calibre1">scar,	her	delicate	neck,	her	thick	upper	arms	and	her	thin	wrists.	I	realized	the little	boys</p>
<p class="calibre1">who	wanted	to	marry	her	because	of	her	smocks	covered	with	balloons	and clowns	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	right	idea,	even	if	they	didn’t	have	all	the	information. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Fuck	you.	Fuck	you.	You	fucking	fink.	You	fucker,”	she	screamed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	went	to	get	my	things,	school	had	already	started.	Miss	Tennessee	left	a message</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	told	me	to	come	when	she	wasn’t	there,	she	would	put	my	things	in	a	box.	I went	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">day	after	school.	I	was	dressed	in	an	Oxford	and	slacks,	a	disappointment	after the	shorts</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	tshirts	of	summer,	especially	since	it	had	yet	to	cool	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">I	let	myself	in.	Miss	Tennessee	had	done	as	she’d	promised.	There	was	a cardboard	box	inside	the	door.	I	closed	the	door	behind	me	and	knelt	down	and opened</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	cardboard	flaps.	There	were	some	paperback	books,	a	few	cds,	two	Tshirts,	a pair	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">socks,	a	cheese	grater,	and	a	garlic	press	I’d	brought	over	to	work	on	a	pan	of lasagna. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>There	were	things	I’d	given	Steve:	a	stuffed	kangaroo	with	the	eyes	gnawed	off, a	pair	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">deer	hooves,	and	a	stick	with	a	feather	on	the	end	(a	cat	toy,	really)	I	teased	him with.	As</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	through	the	box,	I	realized	the	little	man	had	not	met	me	at	the	door, jumping	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	knees	or	running	around	the	room	—	up	on	the	furniture,	down	on	the	floor</p>
<p class="calibre1">—	in	ever-tightening	circles. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	into	the	living	room,	expecting	to	see	him	asleep	on	the	couch.	I	looked in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	kitchen	and	in	the	bedroom.	The	bed	was	unmade	and	Miss	Tennessee’s smocks	hung</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	the	door	of	the	wardrobe.	I	even	looked	in	the	backyard	to	see	if	Steve	had been	left</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	to	squint	into	the	sun.	He	was	nowhere	to	be	found	and	there	were	no	signs of</p>
<p class="calibre1">astronauts.	No	Tang	stains	or	envelopes	from	Cape	Canaveral.	I	fished	around	in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">kitchen	drawer	for	a	piece	of	string	and	fished	around	in	my	pocket	for	all	of Miss</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tennessee’s	keys;	keys	to	the	front	door	and	the	screen	door	and	the	shed	where she	kept</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	lawnmower.	I	threaded	them	onto	the	string	and	opened	the	front	door	to drop	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	the	mailbox. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	notice	the	little	man	until	I	reached	back	inside	for	the	cardboard	box, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	almost	tripped	over	him	when	I	turned	around.	He	stared	up	at	me	with	his huge,	marble</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes,	making	out	what	I	knew	could	be	little	more	than	a	blur.	He	slowly squinted,	almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">closing	his	eyes	before	opening	them	again,	like	he	was	trying	to	hypnotize	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">wanting	to	feed	the	puppy	dog,”	I	always	said	in	my	best	fortune-teller	accent whenever</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	did	this.	“You	are	wanting	to	feed	the	puppy.”	And	everyone	would	laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	calm,	just	sitting	and	squinting.	His	tan	fur	was	dark	brown	in	places, like</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’d	been	rolling	in	dirt,	and	he	had	an	enormous	bluejay	pressed	beneath	his paws.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	nearly	as	big	as	he	was	and	its	feathers	were	dirty	and	bent	but	still brilliantly	blue	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">places.	It	occurred	to	me	to	take	the	keys	out	of	the	mailbox	and	go	get	the shovel.	Steve</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	at	me	expectantly,	his	tiny	ribs	heaving	in	and	out,	but	I	knew	he’d	want her	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">there.	As	I	crouched	down	and	gently	smoothed	his	matted	fur,	I	winced	at	the thought	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	vicious,	eye-pecking	struggle. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a><b class="calibre3">THE	CRYERER</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">When	his	Agent	called,	the	Cryerer	was	sleeping	in	the	Valley.	The	sun,	already up	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">hours,	had	long	over-powered	the	air	conditioning	unit	that	hummed	in	his	ear, and	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">woke	as	always,	pasty	and	flush;	moist	in	a	malarial	way	that	felt	like,	but	was not,	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fever.	He	lurched	out	of	bed	and	patted	around	for	his	cell	phone.	He	patted pants	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">coats	and	towels	and	magazines	and	all	over	the	bedspread,	wiping	sweat	from his	face</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	a	damp	forearm,	before	locating	the	phone	on	the	floor	between	the	bed	and the	ash-covered	nightstand. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	in	God’s	Dark	Universe	are	you,”	his	Agent	said.	“I’ve	been	hitting you</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	911’s	all	morning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	been	running	errands,”	he	lied.	“My	batteries	are	dying.”	He	unbuckled his</p>
<p class="calibre1">belt	and	wiggled	out	of	his	pants.	He	wandered	into	the	bathroom,	surprised	to find</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself	alone.	He	opened	the	door	gently. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>It	wasn’t	working,	his	Agent	explained.	The	network	wanted	to	write	him	in. </p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wish	you	wouldn’t	call	it	that,”	he	said,	easing	the	shower	curtain	aside	with two	fingers. </p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Put	those	out	of	your	mind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	it	bad?”	he	asked,	changing	the	subject. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	it’s	bad.	It’s	terrible.	It’s	worse	than	church.	Worse	than	prison. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s</p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	will	be	who?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>“The	Brother.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	who?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	the	Sister,”	she	said.	“Of	the	Mother	of	the	Baby.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“And	the	Baby	is?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Gone,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	Cryerer	wrote	down	the	time	and	location	on	an	envelope	he	found hanging</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	of	the	nightstand,	then	fell	back	onto	the	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	forget	the	Mall,”	his	Agent	reminded	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	he	said,	mashing	a	pillow	into	his	eye	sockets. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	the	best,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	Cryerer	lay	on	the	bed,	trying	to	find	a	position.	The	fever	was	bad	this</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>morning	and	he	smelled	sulfur.	Rather,	he	had	the	sensation	of	smelling	sulfur. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	sulfur.	This	much	he	had	learned. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Where	had	the	Brazil	Nut	gone?	He	rolled	over,	expecting	her	to	be	there,	as	if he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	missed	her	before.	He	mumbled	her	name;	then	shouted	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">They	had	met	on	a	movie	of	the	week.	He	had	been	the	Brother	and	she	had played	the	girlfriend	of	a	Columbian	drug	lord.	They’d	gone	for	drinks	and	she had	told</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	everything.	He	hadn’t	told	her	anything,	but	she	had	worked	up	a	warm feeling</p>
<p class="calibre1">telling	all	without	interruption	—	save	long	pauses	she	spent,	he	realized	later, snorting</p>
<p class="calibre1">cocaine	in	the	ladies	room	—	and	she	had	associated	this	feeling	with	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Where	was	she? </p>

<p class="calibre1">The	Cryerer	thought	maybe	he	had	killed	her.	He	didn’t	actually	think	so,	but he</p>

<p class="calibre1">him	from	a	great,	echoing	distance.	You	killed	her.	Like	the	smell	of	sulfur. </p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Had	she	really	rolled	down	her	hip-huggers	and	let	a	team	of	development executives	lick	liquor	and	salt	off	her	perverse	paunch	in	an	after	hours	club	in Los	Feliz? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had	that	happened?	Had	she	gone	completely	drug	mad	and	challenged	all manner	of</p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Yes.	That	was	something	she	would	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Had	she	stood,	bombed	out,	in	his	shower	wearing	only	a	strapless	bra,	staring up</p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Yes,	yes.	This	made	sense. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>And,	thus	soaked	and	resuscitated,	had	she	snapped	back,	remembering	where she</p>

<p class="calibre1">abused	and	pre-existing	conditions?	He	thought	of	the	backs	of	her	knees pressed	against</p>

<p class="calibre1">feet	left	the	ground	as	he	shuffled.	He	shook	an	empty	bottle	of	Valium	and	an empty</p>
<p class="calibre1">bottle	of	Xanax.	He	shook	a	forgotten	bottle	of	Dramamine	by	his	ear	and	tablets rattled</p>
<p class="calibre1">inside	like	dice	in	a	cup.	There	were	three.	He	washed	them	down	with	a	handful of</p>
<p class="calibre1">warm	water	before	falling	back	onto	the	bed	and	muttering	…	for	the	motion	of the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>Earth	…	into	the	pillow. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	Brazil	Nut	called,	the	Cryerer	was	standing	in	a	24-hour	drugstore	in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Valley.	He	was	in	the	magazine	aisle,	checking	on	the	competition.	What	his agent	said</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	true,	he	reminded	himself.	He	was	the	best.	There	was	a	guy	in	Chicago turning	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">good	work	in	telephone	commercials	and	another	in	Miami	who	scored	well	in Hispanic</p>
<p class="calibre1">households,	but	he	was	the	best.	He	had	range.	From	a	single,	slow-rolling	tear to	a	face-wrenching,	hyperventilated	blubber,	there	was	no	cry	the	Cryerer couldn’t	do.	He	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">cradled	dead	babies	and	dead	soldiers	and	dead	sisters	in	his	arms.	He	had received	grim</p>
<p class="calibre1">prognoses,	medical	results,	and	death	sentences.	He	had	been	shot	wide,	close-up,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	cranes,	looking	up	from	the	lifeless	bodies	of	babies	and	soldiers	and sisters,	crying</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	into	slowly	rotating	skies. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">He	read	a	story	about	a	movie	star	he	had	known	in	Van	Nuys,	when	he,	the star	-</p>
<p class="calibre1">-	both	of	them	for	that	matter	—	was	a	nobody.	It	took	him	a	long	time	to answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>“Oh	hi.	Your	are	up?”	the	Brazil	Nut	said,	shouting	over	music	bumping	in	the background. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	couldn’t	sleep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	I’m	at	a	drugstore.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“It	sound	like	you	are	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	I’m	not	out.	Where	were	you	this	morning?”	he	asked,	only	slightly relieved</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	be	cleared	of	a	capital	crime. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Out,”	she	said.	“Why	don’t	you	come	out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t.	I	have	to	be	at	the	Mall	tomorrow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“You	are	shopping?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>“No.	It’s	just	a	thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Thing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.”	he	said,	distracted	by	the	magazine.	“I’ll	talk	to	you	later.”	He	put	the phone	in	the	overcoat	he	wore	over	his	pajamas,	took	out	a	bent	cigarette	and	lit it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	frequent	appearances	as	the	Brother,	people	didn’t	recognize	him	in drugstores	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	middle	of	the	night.	Sometimes	people	asked	if	he	was	okay,	if	he	was	sad, but	even</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	didn’t	know	why. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">This	guy,	he	thought	as	he	read.	People	probably	recognized	him	in	24-hour drugstores.	Here	were	pictures	of	his	secret	wedding	in	Malibu,	apparently	taken from	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">helicopter.	Here	were	stills	lifted	from	video	shot	by	a	turncoat	guest.	The Cryerer</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought	of	some	videos	from	Van	Nuys	the	bride	might	like	to	see.	He	puffed	on his</p>
<p class="calibre1">cigarette	without	interference	from	the	security	guard,	who	was	busy	dazzling the	cashier</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	shoplifting	stories. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>The	Cryerer	heard	his	name	and	collected	his	pills	at	the	pharmacy,	dropping the</p>
<p class="calibre1">magazine	on	a	row	of	glucometers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	okay?”	the	cashier	asked	as	the	guard	looked	on	and	massaged	his sidearm.	“Are	you	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">When	his	Agent	called,	the	Cryerer	was	sleeping	in	the	Valley.	He	had	almost fallen</p>
<p class="calibre1">asleep	on	the	way	home	from	the	drugstore,	having	shoveled	down	a	palm	full	of Xanax</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	parking	lot	before	starting	the	car.	He	had	slept	deeply. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	afraid	that	Colombian	might	keep	you	out	all	night,”	his	Agent	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	from	Brazil.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	she	was	Colombian.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“That	was	a	movie.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	look	nice,”	his	Agent	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	for	charity.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Rested?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	the	best,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	Cryerer	got	out	of	the	shower,	he	opened	the	medicine	cabinet	and shook	the	empty	bottles	of	Valiums	and	Xanax	and	the	now-empty	bottle	of Dramamine</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	remembering	his	pills	were	still	in	the	pocket	of	his	overcoat.	He	rifled around	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	nude	and	dug	the	coat	out	from	under	the	bed	and	washed	down	a	pair	of Xanax	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">warm	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>The	Cryerer	sometimes	made	appearances	in	malls	and	on	talk	shows.	He	was frequently	auctioned	off	on	dates	to	women	who	dreamed	of	dating	a	man	who cried</p>
<p class="calibre1">fluently.	They	were	usually	disappointed.	A	calm	came	over	him	as	he	ran	a hand	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	freshly-shaven	face.	He	had	a	serious	face,	and	when	he	had	no	expression	at all	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	angry.	It	made	him	look	old.	He	put	on	a	black	suit	and	a	shirt	the	color of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Band-Aid.	He	tugged	at	his	belt	and	tried	to	find	his	waist.	He	appeared	to	be thin,	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">least	clothed,	but	his	stomach	bulged,	foiling	attempts	to	keep	shirts	tucked	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	well-kemptness	had	a	half-life,	eroding	during	the	day	via	forces	he	couldn’t control.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">checked	and	steadied	himself	in	the	mirror,	and	tried	out	a	few	tearful	poses. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	Brazil	Nut	called,	the	Cryerer	was	sitting	on	a	stool	in	the	Valley.	He felt	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">phone	humming	in	his	pocket	but	couldn’t	answer	because	he	was	next.	The stage	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrayed	with	a	semi-circle	of	stools.	On	each	stool	sat	a	bachelor.	There	was	an attorney</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	a	doctor	and	a	policeman	and	a	soap	opera	star.	The	Cryerer	had	worked with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">soap	opera	star	once	on	a	Sunday	night	sweeps-sweetener	about	the	life	of	St. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Augustine. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>It	was	called	The	Temptation	of	St.	Augustine,	but	was	really	all	about temptation.	There</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	been	protests.	The	Cryerer	had	played	the	Brother,	although	for	all	he	knew St. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Augustine	didn’t	even	have	a	brother. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	soap	opera	star	stood	on	a	makeshift	runway	in	an	open-collared	tuxedo, describing	his	dream	date. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">They,	the	soap	opera	star	and	his	date,	would	meet	for	drinks	in	a	bar	atop	a hotel</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	Santa	Monica.	They	would	hop	into	a	sports	car	and	drive	the	Pacific	Coast Highway</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	sunset,	up	to	Santa	Barbara	for	Italian	food	at	a	little	place	where,	the	soap opera	star</p>
<p class="calibre1">alleged,	the	prociutto	tasted	like	sweet	candy	made	of	meat. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	bidding	was	slow.	Much	slower	than	the	bidding	for	the	policeman,	who was</p>
<p class="calibre1">middle-aged	and	bulky	but	had	promised	to	escort	his	date	to	a	series	of	self-defense</p>
<p class="calibre1">classes	and	firing	ranges	and	help	her	secure	a	carry	permit.	The	doctor,	who seemed</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	young	to	be	a	doctor,	had	promised	a	series	of	teeth-whitening	sessions	and hinted, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>obliquely	the	Cryerer	thought,	at	the	prospect	of	a	boob-job.	It	didn’t	seem	fair. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	bidding	was	slow.	The	hostess,	a	thin	blond	woman	in	a	smart	aquamarine business	suit,	urged	the	women	on.	“What	do	we	have	ladies,	for	a	soap	opera star	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sweet	candy	made	of	meat?	For	charity?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	hands	went	up.	The	star	stood	awkwardly	on	the	runway,	crooning</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come</p>
<p class="calibre1">on,	ladies,”	into	a	cordless	microphone.	The	Cryerer	squirmed	on	his	stool.	A few	bids</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	in	and	a	few	minutes	passed	and	the	hostess	closed	the	bidding.	“Sold,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“to	the	lucky	lady	in	the	light	blue	dress.”	The	lucky	lady,	a	woman	old	enough to	be	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">star’s	mother,	joined	him	on	the	runway	where	they	locked	hands	and	bowed	to desultory</p>
<p class="calibre1">applause.	The	Cryerer	was	next. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	hostess	introduced	him,	detailed	his	many	appearances	as	the	Brother	on Sunday	night	movies	of	the	week	and	on	cable	channels	well	known	to	the audience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Remember	ladies,	it’s	for	charity,”	she	admonished	before	surrendering	the microphone. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>The	Cryerer	walked	to	the	end	of	the	runway.	He	managed	a	smile	—	“Good afternoon,	ladies”	—	and	began	his	spiel,	which	included	oysters,	cocktails,	a walk	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">beach,	and,	he	hoped	but	did	not	say,	backs	of	knees	pressed	against	elbows, preferably</p>
<p class="calibre1">knees	not	belonging	to	someone	old	enough	to	be	his	mother.	The	bidding	was slow.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	out	on	the	faces	of	the	women	perched	on	folding	chairs.	There	were conversations,	women	explaining	to	friends	who	he	was	and	about	his	pathetic quality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	explainers	whispered	out	of	the	sides	of	their	mouths,	pointing	and	looking at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Explainees	nodded	and	made	emphatic	faces	that	said,	“Aww.	He	cries,”	and	the bidding</p>
<p class="calibre1">gained	momentum. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“500.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“600.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“750.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">This	is	the	way	it	always	happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>“850.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“900.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Women	were	curious	and	concerned.	They	wanted	to	help. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“950.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“1000.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">They	would	be	disappointed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Two	thousand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">All	heads	turned	to	a	pale,	tall	redhead	standing	behind	the	rows	of	folding chairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	we	have	a	bid	in	the	back?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Two	thousand,”	the	redhead	said,	arms	crossed,	one	foot	balanced	on	a	heel in</p>
<p class="calibre1">front	of	the	other.	She	turned	away,	revealing	a	jagged	silhouette. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sold,”	said	the	hostess.	“To	the	woman	in	the	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	redhead	joined	the	Cryerer	on	the	runway	where	they	joined	hands	and took	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bow.	Through	the	applause,	the	woman	whispered,	“I’m	a	really	big	fan.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">When	his	mother	called,	the	Cryerer	was	driving	in	the	Valley,	speeding	toward Manhattan	Beach	with	the	redhead	at	his	side.	She	wore	leather	pants	and	a purple	jacket</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	matched	her	toenail	polish.	The	Cryerer	didn’t	answer.	He	hadn’t	spoken	to his</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother	in	years. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“So	I	loved	you	in	The	Cryist,”	the	redhead	said,	walking	long	fingers	up	his leg</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	smiling.	“And	in	The	Crying	Man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Here	was	a	true	fan.	Before	he’d	become	aware	of	the	scope	of	his	pathetic quality,	the	Cryerer	had	appeared	in	adult	features.	It	was	a	turn-off	to	most	—	a man	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">bawled	helplessly	before,	during,	and	after	the	act	—	even	to	women,	among whom	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pornographers	in	Van	Nuys	thought	this	display	might	find	a	sympathetic</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>audience.	To</p>
<p class="calibre1">men,	it	was	so	implausible	as	to	be	upsetting	or,	on	the	other	hand,	so	plausible that</p>
<p class="calibre1">habitual	users	reported	a	moment	of	clarity	that	often	put	them	off	the	trade	for good.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">redhead	was	an	exception.	She	leaned	over	and	breathed	into	his	neck.	“Do	you feel</p>
<p class="calibre1">sad?”	she	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">When	his	Agent	called	the	Cryerer	was	in	the	fetal	position	under	a	bar	in Manhattan</p>
<p class="calibre1">Beach,	a	cold	brass	foot-rail	bumping	rhythmically	against	his	forehead.	He covered	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">head	from	blows	delivered	by	a	giant	man,	who	—	he	had	managed	to	gather	—</p>
<p class="calibre1">played</p>
<p class="calibre1">cornerback	for	Pepperdine.	He	braced	and	waited	for	it	to	stop,	trying	to	protect his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Fucking	crying	ass	faggot,”	the	giant	shouted,	punctuating	each	blow	with	a syllable.	“Fucking	cry-ing	ass	fag-got.”	Eventually	it	did	stop	and	the	Cryerer rolled</p>
<p class="calibre1">onto	his	back.	The	redhead	knelt	at	his	side,	running	purple	fingernails	through his	hair</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	searching	his	face	for	tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>“Are	you	alright?”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	guess,”	he	said,	stretching	his	body	tentatively. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	ahead,	you	can	let	it	out.	Let	it	out,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">It	all	happened	quickly	and	the	Cryerer	had	not	immediately	understood.	The redhead	spoke	breathlessly	all	the	way	from	the	Valley,	about	his	movies	and about	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">pathetic	quality,	and	about	how	these	made	her	feel.	In	the	bar	she	had	leaned very	close</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	him,	running	single	long	fingers	lightly	above	her	plunging	camisole,	talking about</p>
<p class="calibre1">how	excited	she	was	and	how	she	couldn’t	wait	for	the	evening	to	come	to	an end,	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	really	be	only	the	beginning.	But	now,	lying	on	his	back,	he	understood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">excused	herself	from	the	table	and	returned	with	the	giant	man,	who	she	had	told all</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	the	Cryerer	and	his	pathetic	quality,	about	how	he	was	a	creep	and	was bothering</p>
<p class="calibre1">her. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	ahead,	you	can	let	it	out.	Let	it	out,”	she	urged. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">It	had	progressed	very	quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on	it’s	alright,”	she	panted.	“Give	it	to	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Clearly	she	was	disappointed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">When	his	Agent	called	the	Cryerer	was	lying	awake	in	the	Valley.	It	was	mid-morning</p>
<p class="calibre1">already	but	he	was	lying	there,	still	and	awake,	monitoring	various	pains	in	his body	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">wondering	what	they	might	mean. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“You	better	not	be	in	bed,”	his	Agent	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“My	face	is	fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Columbian?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	they	love	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	Cryerer	stretched	his	body	cautiously,	poking	at	his	ribs	with	two	fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	ready?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	Cryerer	rolled	out	of	bed	and	peeled	off	his	suit	and	the	shirt	the	color	of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Band-Aid.	He	looked	at	himself	in	the	bathroom	mirror	and	found	his	face	to	be as	he	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">reported,	terminally	serious	but	untouched,	although	his	torso	was	covered	with red</p>
<p class="calibre1">bruises	the	size	of	compact	discs.	He	eased	himself	into	the	shower	and	stood there	for	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">long	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	phone	rang	again	while	the	Cryerer	was	driving	in	the	Valley.	The	fingers	of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">right	hand	were	stiff	and	sore	and	when	he	reached	for	the	phone	he	knocked	it under	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">passenger	seat.	At	a	light	he	reached	over	the	emergency	brake	and	his	aching</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>ribs	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">fished	around.	The	phone	rang	as	he	fished,	but	when	he	finally	located	it	the ringing	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">stopped	and	his	hand	was	smeared	with	streaks	of	thin,	brown	film	and	he	tried to</p>
<p class="calibre1">remember	not	to	touch	his	mouth	or	his	face,	going	so	far	as	to	retrieve	his cigarette	pack</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	his	pocket	and	a	cigarette	from	the	pack	all	with	his	left	hand	as	he	drove	to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">studio.	When	the	Brazil	Nut	called,	the	Cryerer	considered	the	phone	and	the thin,	brown</p>
<p class="calibre1">film	before	answering.	She	was	crying. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“You	are	where?”	she	sobbed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“On	my	way	to	the	studio,”	he	said.	“Where	are	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“In	darkness,”	she	blubbered. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll	be	fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>“You’re	fine.	Take	a	Valium.	Do	you	have	Valium?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Already	I	take.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll	be	fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	dying.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“You	are	not	either	dying,”	the	Cryerer	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	to	get	ready.	I’m	late.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	the	Brazil	Nut	sobbed	as	the	Cryerer	hung	up	the	phone. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	studio,	the	guard	waved	him	through	with	barely	a	pause.	He	parked the</p>
<p class="calibre1">car	and	sat,	wiping	his	hand	on	the	passenger	seat,	taking	a	few	moments	to collect</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself.	He	dialed	a	number	and	let	it	ring.	When	the	redhead	answered	—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	this	is</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>Alex.”	—	he	hung	up,	relieved	she	was	still	alive.	He	smelled	sulfur	and	heard metal</p>
<p class="calibre1">scraping	on	metal.	He	recalled	yellow	gun-shaped	controls	that	sent	tiny	cars flying</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	the	track,	and	often	flying	off	the	track,	at	what	seemed	like	impressive speeds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	had	been	no	intensive	training	and	everything	was	left	to	chance.	Hold	the trigger</p>
<p class="calibre1">tight	and	so	what	if	the	car,	filled	with	oil	from	a	tiny	plastic	bubble,	comes flying	off	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">track	and	across	the	carpet	amid	smells	of	sulfur	and	reckless	speed?	These	were not</p>
<p class="calibre1">historic	runs. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">He	remembered	the	day,	four	days	after	Christmas,	that	the	track	caught	fire, right</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	under	the	tree.	It	was	the	scraping	of	the	trigger	back	and	forth,	lurching the	cars</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	the	track,	that	set	the	black	plastic	pieces	of	track	on	fire.	Pieces	of	metal like	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">wooden	sticks	scraping	together	to	make	fire.	The	gorgeous	smell	of	electrical fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	Cryerer	limped	into	the	studio.	He	had	worked	with	the	Sister,	the	woman playing</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Mother	of	the	Baby,	before.	She	had	had	a	sitcom	once	and	had	since	been	in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>many	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	missing	baby	capers.	The	director	was	somber	and	supportive.	He	nodded whenever</p>
<p class="calibre1">people	spoke	and	looked	into	their	eyes.	The	Cryerer	thought	he	recognized	him from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Van	Nuys.	He	couldn’t	be	sure,	but	if	so	he	had	once	been	known	as	the	Skin Doctor	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	might	have	the	tapes	that	could	wreck	that	beautiful	Malibu	wedding. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“So,”	the	director	began	solemnly.	“You	are	the	Mother	of	the	Baby.”	He	fixed his	eyes	on	the	eyes	of	the	Sister	and	nodded.	“And	you	are	the	Brother.”	He turned	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes	to	the	Cryerer,	nodding	and	fixing.	“And	the	Baby	is	gone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Brother	and	Sister	both	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">He	repeated:	“And	the	Baby”	(looking	at	the	Cryerer),	“your	baby”	(looking	at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sister,	the	Mother	of	the	Baby),	“is	gone”	(looking	intently	at	both). </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	Brazil	Nut	called,	the	Cryerer	was	having	make-up	applied. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“You	are	where?”	she	sobbed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	at	the	studio.	I	told	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	dying.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	I	call	you	back	later?	Listen	I’ll	call	you	back	later,”	he	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	I	won’t	be	here,”	she	said.	“I’m	going	away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	Cryerer	couldn’t	remember	how	long	he	sat	there,	watching	blankly	as	the racetrack</p>
<p class="calibre1">melted	and	the	Christmas	tree	dissolved	in	flames.	It	was	engulfed	almost immediately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	not	startled;	not	even	amazed.	He	sat	there	on	the	living	room	carpet, watching</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	tree	spit	bits	of	itself	onto	the	rug	around	him.	His	father	appeared,	suddenly and</p>
<p class="calibre1">aggressively,	stomping	viciously	on	the	racetrack	and	headlong	tackling	the flaming	tree</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	a	counter-intuitive	attempt	to	make	it	stop	flaming,	which	(more	counter-intuitively</p>
<p class="calibre1">still)	seemed	to	work.	He	watched	with	fascination	in	lieu	of	horror,	his	father wrestling</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a>the	green,	smoking	limbs	back	and	forth	across	the	deep-pile	carpet	before finally</p>
<p class="calibre1">standing	up	and	kicking	ridiculously	at	the	smoldering	branches,	sending	storms of	dried</p>
<p class="calibre1">needles	across	the	carpet. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">His	father,	covered	in	botanical	soot,	loomed	over	him.	The	Cryerer	sat	awed amid	the	wreckage,	pulling	the	trigger	of	the	pistol-shaped	controller.	Metal	on metal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back	and	forth. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Put	that	fucking	thing	down,”	his	father	boomed,	grabbing	the	cord	and snapping</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	controller	out	of	the	child’s	hands.	The	moment	the	controller	left	his	hand, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">returned	to	the	scene.	His	father	looming.	The	Christmas	tree	smoldering.	He had	begun</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	cry	all	at	once,	uncontrollable	spasms	racking	his	small	body,	terminating	in	a full, </p>
<p class="calibre1">open-mouthed	blubber. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Look	at	this,”	his	father	roared.	“You	think	this	is	funny?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	boy	shook	his	head,	gasped,	and	moved	his	lips	in	an	airless,	“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quit	your	damn	cryin’.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Another	airless,	“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	Brazil	Nut	called	again,	the	Cryerer	was	on	the	set	in	the	Valley, preparing	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">embrace	and	comfort	the	Mother	of	the	Baby. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“You	have	a	call,”	whispered	a	production	assistant	who	had	stepped	up gingerly</p>
<p class="calibre1">beside	him.	“It	sounds	like	an	emergency.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	Cryerer	excused	himself.	He	stepped	behind	a	camera,	put	a	finger	in	one ear</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	picked	up	the	phone. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“What.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know,”	she	whispered	quietly.	“I	am	loving	you	David.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	talking	about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know,	I	am	not	blame	you	for	anything	David.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	not	crying. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Get	some	rest.	I’ll	call	you	later.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	singing. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Am	not	here	later	David,”	she	sang. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	working,”	he	said.	“Go	to	bed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	Cryerer	stood	there	for	moment.	He	put	his	head	down	and	closed	his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	director	appeared	he	waved	him	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Almost	ready,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">His	father	lay	flat	on	the	carpet,	peaceful	except	for	the	red	half-moon	spreading around</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	head	from	where	he	had	collided	with	the	coffee	table,	causing	a	cloud	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>Christmas</p>
<p class="calibre1">cards	to	erupt	and	gently	float	to	the	ground.	It	all	happened	quickly	—	the clutching,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">staggering,	the	falling	—	and	the	Cryerer	had	not	immediately	understood.	His mother</p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared	from	nowhere.	Kneeling	amid	ashes	and	drink	coasters,	she	ran	long fingers</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	her	husband’s	hair	and	dabbed	at	his	head	with	a	dishtowel.	“Are	you alright?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	screamed.	“Are	you	okay?”	she	begged	him	as	the	Cryerer	muttered	a	steady stream</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	airless	“No’s.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">He	passed	a	forefinger	under	each	eye	to	mop	up	tears	that	had	already	begun	to form. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	ready,”	he	said.	A	woman	in	an	army	jacket	appeared	and	applied	a	few fingertips</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	make-up	under	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	a	big	fan,”	she	said.	He	nodded,	managing	a	twitch.	“Are	you	okay?”	she asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">It	started	in	his	lower	back,	an	intense	and	knotted	throb.	It	would’ve	been difficult	for	him	to	sit,	and	he	shifted	from	foot	to	foot	to	keep	the	spasms moving. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Places,”	the	director	said,	and	the	Cryerer	took	his	place	outside	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mother	of	the	Baby	sat	inside	some	sort	of	a	waiting	room	—	it	could	have	been a	hospital</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	a	police	station. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">He	tried	to	stand	still	with	the	throbbing	growing	in	his	back	and	contractions, like	hiccups,	taking	hold	in	his	chest.	He	tried	to	still	his	quivering	lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Rolling,”	the	director	called	from	the	other	side	of	the	door.	“And	action.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	Cryerer	lurched	through	the	door	and	his	pretend	Sister,	the	Mother	of	the pretend	Baby,	rose. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	came	as	soon	as	you	called,”	he	panted. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	John.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	the	Baby.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	is	she?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Gone,”	the	Mother	squeaked,	nodding	slowly	in	a	protracted	wince	before burying	here	face	in	the	Cryerer’s	shoulder,	the	Cryerer	himself	now	coming unglued	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	throbs	and	contractions	became	no	longer	local,	wrenching	his	entire	body and</p>
<p class="calibre1">turning	his	trembling	lips	into	an	eight-shaped,	teeth-baring	hole.	The	crane zoomed	in	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">capture	the	close-up	and	locked	for	a	moment	before	panning	right,	then	left, then</p>
<p class="calibre1">spiraling	gently	up	and	around	the	entangled	bodies	of	the	mourners	as	the	point of	view</p>
<p class="calibre1">rose,	turned	and	dissolved	somewhere	up	—	up,	up,	up	—	and	into	the	slowly rotating	sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
