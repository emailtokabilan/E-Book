<h2 class="calibre3" id="calibre_pb_8">5. DRM is a bad business-move for MSFT</h2>
<p class="calibre1">When Sony brought out the VCR, it made a record player that could play Hollywood’s records, even if Hollywood didn’t like the idea. The industries that grew up on the back of the VCR — movie rentals, home taping, camcorders, even Bar Mitzvah videographers — made billions for Sony and its cohort.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That was good business — even if Sony lost the Betamax-VHS format wars, the money on the world-with-VCRs table was enough to make up for it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But then Sony acquired a relatively tiny entertainment company and it started to massively screw up. When MP3 rolled around and Sony’s walkman customers were clamoring for a solid-state MP3 player, Sony let its music business-unit run its show: instead of making a high-capacity MP3 walkman, Sony shipped its Music Clips, low-capacity devices that played brain-damaged DRM formats like Real and OpenMG. They spent good money engineering “features” into these devices that kept their customers from freely moving their music back and forth between their devices. Customers stayed away in droves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Today, Sony is dead in the water when it comes to walkmen. The market leaders are poky Singaporean outfits like Creative Labs — the kind of company that Sony used to crush like a bug, back before it got borged by its entertainment unit — and PC companies like Apple.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s because Sony shipped a product that there was no market demand for. No Sony customer woke up one morning and said, “Damn, I wish Sony would devote some expensive engineering effort in order that I may do less with my music.” Presented with an alternative, Sony’s customers enthusiastically jumped ship.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The same thing happened to a lot of people I know who used to rip their CDs to WMA. You guys sold them software that produced smaller, better-sounding rips than the MP3 rippers, but you also fixed it so that the songs you ripped were device-locked to their PCs. What that meant is that when they backed up their music to another hard-drive and reinstalled their OS (something that the spyware and malware wars has made more common than ever), they discovered that after they restored their music that they could no longer play it. The player saw the new OS as a different machine, and locked them out of their own music.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is no market demand for this “feature.” None of your customers want you to make expensive modifications to your products that make backing up and restoring even harder. And there is no moment when your customers will be less forgiving than the moment that they are recovering from catastrophic technology failures.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I speak from experience. Because I buy a new Powerbook every ten months, and because I always order the new models the day they’re announced, I get a lot of lemons from Apple. That means that I hit Apple’s three-iTunes-authorized-computers limit pretty early on and found myself unable to play the hundreds of dollars’ worth of iTunes songs I’d bought because one of my authorized machines was a lemon that Apple had broken up for parts, one was in the shop getting fixed by Apple, and one was my mom’s computer, 3,000 miles away in Toronto.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If I had been a less good customer for Apple’s hardware, I would have been fine. If I had been a less enthusiastic evangelist for Apple’s products — if I hadn’t shown my mom how iTunes Music Store worked — I would have been fine. If I hadn’t bought so much iTunes music that burning it to CD and re-ripping it and re-keying all my metadata was too daunting a task to consider, I would have been fine.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As it was Apple rewarded my trust, evangelism and out-of-control spending by treating me like a crook and locking me out of my own music, at a time when my Powerbook was in the shop — i.e., at a time when I was hardly disposed to feel charitable to Apple.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m an edge case here, but I’m a <i class="calibre2">leading edge</i> case. If Apple succeeds in its business plans, it will only be a matter of time until even average customers have upgraded enough hardware and bought enough music to end up where I am.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You know what I would totally buy? A record player that let me play everybody’s records. Right now, the closest I can come to that is an open source app called VLC, but it’s clunky and buggy and it didn’t come pre-installed on my computer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sony didn’t make a Betamax that only played the movies that Hollywood was willing to permit — Hollywood asked them to do it, they proposed an early, analog broadcast flag that VCRs could hunt for and respond to by disabling recording. Sony ignored them and made the product they thought their customers wanted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m a Microsoft customer. Like millions of other Microsoft customers, I want a player that plays anything I throw at it, and I think that you are just the company to give it to me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes, this would violate copyright law as it stands, but Microsoft has been making tools of piracy that change copyright law for decades now. Outlook, Exchange and MSN are tools that abet widescale digital infringement.</p>
<p class="calibre1">More significantly, IIS and your caching proxies all make and serve copies of documents without their authors’ consent, something that, if it is legal today, is only legal because companies like Microsoft went ahead and did it and dared lawmakers to prosecute.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Microsoft stood up for its customers and for progress, and won so decisively that most people never even realized that there was a fight.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Do it again! This is a company that looks the world’s roughest, toughest anti-trust regulators in the eye and laughs. Compared to anti-trust people, copyright lawmakers are pantywaists. You can take them with your arm behind your back.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In Siva Vaidhyanathan’s book The Anarchist in the Library, he talks about why the studios are so blind to their customers’ desires. It’s because people like you and me spent the 80s and the 90s telling them bad science fiction stories about impossible DRM technology that would let them charge a small sum of money every time someone looked at a movie — want to fast-forward? That feature costs another penny. Pausing is two cents an hour. The mute button will cost you a quarter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When Mako Analysis issued their report last month advising phone companies to stop supporting Symbian phones, they were just writing the latest installment in this story. Mako says that phones like my P900, which can play MP3s as ringtones, are bad for the cellphone economy, because it’ll put the extortionate ringtone sellers out of business. What Mako is saying is that just because you bought the CD doesn’t mean that you should expect to have the ability to listen to it on your MP3 player, and just because it plays on your MP3 player is no reason to expect it to run as a ringtone. I wonder how they feel about alarm clocks that will play a CD to wake you up in the morning? Is that strangling the nascent “alarm tone” market?</p>
<p class="calibre1">The phone companies’ customers want Symbian phones and for now, at least, the phone companies understand that if they don’t sell them, someone else will.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The market opportunity for a truly capable devices is enormous. There’s a company out there charging <i class="calibre2">$27,000</i> for a DVD jukebox — go and eat their lunch! Steve Jobs isn’t going to do it: he’s off at the D conference telling studio execs not to release hi-def movies until they’re sure no one will make a hi-def DVD burner that works with a PC.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe they won’t buy into his BS, but they’re also not much interested in what you have to sell. At the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group meetings where the Broadcast Flag was hammered out, the studios’ position was, “We’ll take anyone’s DRM except Microsoft’s and Philips’.” When I met with UK broadcast wonks about the European version of the Broadcast Flag underway at the Digital Video Broadcasters’ forum, they told me, “Well, it’s different in Europe: mostly they’re worried that some American company like Microsoft will get their claws into European television.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">American film studios didn’t want the Japanese electronics companies to get a piece of the movie pie, so they fought the VCR. Today, everyone who makes movies agrees that they don’t want to let you guys get between them and their customers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sony didn’t get permission. Neither should you. Go build the record player that can play everyone’s records.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because if you don’t do it, someone else will.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">$$$$</p>
<p class="calibre1">The DRM Sausage Factory</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Originally published as “A Behind-The-Scenes Look At How DRM Becomes Law,” InformationWeek, July 11, 2007)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Otto von Bismarck quipped, “Laws are like sausages, it is better not to see them being made.” I’ve seen sausages made. I’ve seen laws made. Both pale in comparison to the process by which anti-copying technology agreements are made.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This technology, usually called “Digital Rights Management” (DRM) proposes to make your computer worse at copying some of the files on its hard-drive or on other media. Since all computer operations involve copying, this is a daunting task — as security expert Bruce Schneier has said, “Making bits harder to copy is like making water that’s less wet.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">At root, DRMs are technologies that treat the owner of a computer or other device as an attacker, someone against whom the system must be armored. Like the electrical meter on the side of your house, a DRM is a technology that you possess, but that you are never supposed to be able to manipulate or modify. Unlike the your meter, though, a DRM that is defeated in one place is defeated in all places, nearly simultaneously. That is to say, once someone takes the DRM off a song or movie or ebook, that freed collection of bits can be sent to anyone else, anywhere the network reaches, in an eyeblink. DRM crackers need cunning: those who receive the fruits of their labor need only know how to download files from the Internet.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Why manufacture a device that attacks its owner? A priori, one would assume that such a device would cost more to make than a friendlier one, and that customers would prefer not to buy devices that treat them as presumptive criminals. DRM technologies limit more than copying: they limit ranges of uses, such as viewing a movie in a different country, copying a song to a different manufacturer’s player, or even pausing a movie for too long. Surely, this stuff hurts sales: who goes into a store and asks, “Do you have any music that’s locked to just one company’s player? I’m in the market for some lock-in.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">So why do manufacturers do it? As with many strange behaviors, there’s a carrot at play here, and a stick.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The carrot is the entertainment industries’ promise of access to their copyrighted works. Add DRM to your iPhone and we’ll supply music for it. Add DRM to your TiVo and we’ll let you plug it into our satellite receivers. Add DRM to your Zune and we’ll let you retail our music in your Zune store.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The stick is the entertainment industries’ threat of lawsuits for companies that don’t comply. In the last century, entertainment companies fought over the creation of records, radios, jukeboxes, cable TV, VCRs, MP3 players and other technologies that made it possible to experience a copyrighted work in a new way without permission. There’s one battle that serves as the archetype for the rest: the fight over the VCR.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The film studios were outraged by Sony’s creation of the VCR. They had found a DRM supplier they preferred, a company called Discovision that made non-recordable optical discs. Discovision was the only company authorized to play back movies in your living room. The only way to get a copyrighted work onto a VCR cassette was to record it off the TV, without permission. The studios argued that Sony — whose Betamax was the canary in this legal coalmine — was breaking the law by unjustly endangering their revenue from Discovision royalties. Sure, they <i class="calibre2">could</i> just sell pre-recorded Betamax tapes, but Betamax was a read-write medium: they could be <i class="calibre2">copied</i>. Moreover, your personal library of Betamax recordings of the Sunday night movie would eat into the market for Discovision discs: why would anyone buy a pre-recorded video cassette when they could amass all the video they needed with a home recorder and a set of rabbit-ears?</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Supreme Court threw out these arguments in a 1984 5-4 decision, the “Betamax Decision.” This decision held that the VCR was legal because it was “capable of sustaining a substantially non-infringing use.” That means that if you make a technology that your customers <i class="calibre2">can</i> use legally, you’re not on the hook for the illegal stuff they do.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This principle guided the creation of virtually every piece of IT invented since: the Web, search engines, YouTube, Blogger, Skype, ICQ, AOL, MySpace… You name it, if it’s possible to violate copyright with it, the thing that made it possible is the Betamax principle.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately, the Supremes shot the Betamax principle in the gut two years ago, with the Grokster decision. This decision says that a company can be found liable for its customers’ bad acts if they can be shown to have “induced” copyright infringement. So, if your company advertises your product for an infringing use, or if it can be shown that you had infringement in mind at the design stage, you can be found liable for your customers’ copying. The studios and record labels and broadcasters <i class="calibre2">love</i> this ruling, and they like to think that it’s even broader than what the courts set out. For example, Viacom is suing Google for inducing copyright infringement by allowing YouTube users to flag some of their videos as private. Private videos can’t be found by Viacom’s copyright-enforcement bots, so Viacom says that privacy should be illegal, and that companies that give you the option of privacy should be sued for anything you do behind closed doors.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The gutshot Betamax doctrine will bleed out all over the industry for decades (or until the courts or Congress restore it to health), providing a grisly reminder of what happens to companies that try to pour the entertainment companies’ old wine into new digital bottles without permission. The tape-recorder was legal, but the digital tape-recorder is an inducement to infringement, and must be stopped.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The promise of access to content and the threat of legal execution for non-compliance is enough to lure technology’s biggest players to the DRM table.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I started attending DRM meetings in March, 2002, on behalf of my former employers, the Electronic Frontier Foundation. My first meeting was the one where Broadcast Flag was born. The Broadcast Flag was weird even by DRM standards. Broadcasters are required, by law, to deliver TV and radio without DRM, so that any standards-compliant receiver can receive them. The airwaves belong to the public, and are loaned to broadcasters who have to promise to serve the public interest in exchange. But the MPAA and the broadcasters wanted to add DRM to digital TV, and so they proposed that a law should be passed that would make all manufacturers promise to <i class="calibre2">pretend</i> that there was DRM on broadcast signals, receiving them and immediately squirreling them away in encrypted form.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Broadcast Flag was hammered out in a group called the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group (BPDG) a sub-group from the MPAA’s “Content Protection Technology Working Group,” which also included reps from all the big IT companies (Microsoft, Apple, Intel, and so on), consumer electronics companies (Panasonic, Philips, Zenith), cable companies, satellite companies, and anyone else who wanted to pay $100 to attend the “public” meetings, held every six weeks or so (you can attend these meetings yourself if you find yourself near LAX on one of the upcoming dates).</p>
<p class="calibre1">CPTWG (pronounced Cee-Pee-Twig) is a venerable presence in the DRM world. It was at CPTWG that the DRM for DVDs was hammered out. CPTWG meetings open with a “benediction,” delivered by a lawyer, who reminds everyone there that what they say might be quoted “on the front page of the New York Times,” (though journalists are barred from attending CPTWG meetings and no minutes are published by the organization) and reminding all present not to do anything that would raise eyebrows at the FTC’s anti-trust division (I could swear I’ve seen the Microsoft people giggling during this part, though that may have been my imagination).</p>
<p class="calibre1">The first part of the meeting is usually taken up with administrative business and presentations from DRM vendors, who come out to promise that this time they’ve really, really figured out how to make computers worse at copying. The real meat comes after the lunch, when the group splits into a series of smaller meetings, many of them closed-door and private (the representatives of the organizations responsible for managing DRM on DVDs splinter off at this point).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then comes the working group meetings, like the BPDG. The BPDG was nominally set up to set up the rules for the Broadcast Flag. Under the Flag, manufacturers would be required to limit their “outputs and recording methods” to a set of “approved technologies.” Naturally, every manufacturer in the room showed up with a technology to add to the list of approved technologies — and the sneakier ones showed up with reasons why their competitors’ technologies <i class="calibre2">shouldn’t</i> be approved. If the Broadcast Flag became law, a spot on the “approved technologies” list would be a license to print money: everyone who built a next-gen digital TV would be required, by law, to buy only approved technologies for their gear.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The CPTWG determined that there would be three “chairmen” of the meetings: a representative from the broadcasters, a representative from the studios, and a representative from the IT industry (note that no “consumer rights” chair was contemplated — we proposed one and got laughed off the agenda). The IT chair was filled by an Intel representative, who seemed pleased that the MPAA chair, Fox Studios’s Andy Setos, began the process by proposing that the approved technologies should include only two technologies, both of which Intel partially owned.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Intel’s presence on the committee was both reassurance and threat: reassurance because Intel signaled the fundamental reasonableness of the MPAA’s requirements — why would a company with a bigger turnover than the whole movie industry show up if the negotiations weren’t worth having? Threat because Intel was poised to gain an advantage that might be denied to its competitors.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We settled in for a long negotiation. The discussions were drawn out and heated. At regular intervals, the MPAA reps told us that we were wasting time — if we didn’t hurry things along, the world would move on and consumers would grow accustomed to un-crippled digital TVs. Moreover, Rep Billy Tauzin, the lawmaker who’d evidently promised to enact the Broadcast Flag into law, was growing impatient. The warnings were delivered in quackspeak, urgent and crackling, whenever the discussions dragged, like the crack of the commissars’ pistols, urging us forward.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You’d think that a “technology working group” would concern itself with technology, but there was precious little discussion of bits and bytes, ciphers and keys. Instead, we focused on what amounted to contractual terms: if your technology got approved as a DTV “output,” what obligations would you have to assume? If a TiVo could serve as an “output” for a receiver, what outputs would the TiVo be allowed to have?</p>
<p class="calibre1">The longer we sat there, the more snarled these contractual terms became: winning a coveted spot on the “approved technology” list would be quite a burden! Once you were in the club, there were all sorts of rules about whom you could associate with, how you had to comport yourself and so on.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of these rules of conduct was “robustness.” As a condition of approval, manufacturers would have to harden their technologies so that their customers wouldn’t be able to modify, improve upon, or even understand their workings. As you might imagine, the people who made open source TV tuners were not thrilled about this, as “open source” and “non-user-modifiable” are polar opposites.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another was “renewability:” the ability of the studios to revoke outputs that had been compromised in the field. The studios expected the manufacturers to make products with remote “kill switches” that could be used to shut down part or all of their device if someone, somewhere had figured out how to do something naughty with it. They promised that we’d establish criteria for renewability later, and that it would all be “fair.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">But we soldiered on. The MPAA had a gift for resolving the worst snarls: when shouting failed, they’d lead any recalcitrant player out of the room and negotiate in secret with them, leaving the rest of us to cool our heels. Once, they took the Microsoft team out of the room for <i class="calibre2">six hours</i>, then came back and announced that digital video would be allowed to output on non-DRM monitors at a greatly reduced resolution (this “feature” appears in Vista as “fuzzing”).</p>
<p class="calibre1">The further we went, the more nervous everyone became. We were headed for the real meat of the negotiations: the <i class="calibre2">criteria</i> by which approved technology would be evaluated: how many bits of crypto would you need? Which ciphers would be permissible? Which features would and wouldn’t be allowed?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then the MPAA dropped the other shoe: the sole criteria for inclusion on the list would be the approval of one of its member-companies, or a quorum of broadcasters. In other words, the Broadcast Flag wouldn’t be an “objective standard,” describing the technical means by which video would be locked away — it would be purely subjective, up to the whim of the studios. You could have the best product in the world, and they wouldn’t approve it if your business-development guys hadn’t bought enough drinks for their business-development guys at a CES party.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To add insult to injury, the only technologies that the MPAA were willing to consider for initial inclusion as “approved” were the two that Intel was involved with. The Intel co-chairman had a hard time hiding his grin. He’d acted as Judas goat, luring in Apple, Microsoft, and the rest, to legitimize a process that would force them to license Intel’s patents for every TV technology they shipped until the end of time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Why did the MPAA give Intel such a sweetheart deal? At the time, I figured that this was just straight quid pro quo, like Hannibal said to Clarice. But over the years, I started to see a larger pattern: Hollywood likes DRM consortia, and they hate individual DRM vendors. (I’ve written an entire article about this, but here’s the gist: a single vendor who succeeds can name their price and terms — think of Apple or Macrovision — while a consortium is a more easily divided rabble, susceptible to co-option in order to produce ever-worsening technologies — think of Blu-Ray and HD-DVD). Intel’s technologies were held through two consortia, the 5C and 4C groups.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The single-vendor manufacturers were livid at being locked out of the digital TV market. The final report of the consortium reflected this — a few sheets written by the chairmen describing the “consensus” and hundreds of pages of angry invective from manufacturers and consumer groups decrying it as a sham.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tauzin washed his hands of the process: a canny, sleazy Hill operator, he had the political instincts to get his name off any proposal that could be shown to be a plot to break voters’ televisions (Tauzin found a better industry to shill for, the pharmaceutical firms, who rewarded him with a $2,000,000/year job as chief of PHARMA, the pharmaceutical lobby).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even Representative Ernest “Fritz” Hollings (“The Senator from Disney,” who once proposed a bill requiring entertainment industry oversight of all technologies capable of copying) backed away from proposing a bill that would turn the Broadcast Flag into law. Instead, Hollings sent a memo to Michael Powell, then-head of the FCC, telling him that the FCC already had jurisdiction to enact a Broadcast Flag regulation, without Congressional oversight.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Powell’s staff put Hollings’s letter online, as they are required to do by federal sunshine laws. The memo arrived as a Microsoft Word file — which EFF then downloaded and analyzed. Word stashes the identity of a document’s author in the file metadata, which is how EFF discovered that the document had been written by a staffer at the MPAA.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This was truly remarkable. Hollings was a powerful committee chairman, one who had taken immense sums of money from the industries he was supposed to be regulating. It’s easy to be cynical about this kind of thing, but it’s genuinely unforgivable: politicians draw a public salary to sit in public office and work for the public good. They’re supposed to be working for us, not their donors.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But we all know that this isn’t true. Politicians are happy to give special favors to their pals in industry. However, the Hollings memo was beyond the pale. Staffers for the MPAA were writing Hollings’s memos, memos that Hollings then signed and mailed off to the heads of major governmental agencies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The best part was that the legal eagles at the MPAA were wrong. The FCC took “Hollings’s” advice and enacted a Broadcast Flag regulation that was almost identical to the proposal from the BPDG, turning themselves into America’s “device czars,” able to burden any digital technology with “robustness,” “compliance” and “revocation rules.” The rule lasted just long enough for the DC Circuit Court of Appeals to strike it down and slap the FCC for grabbing unprecedented jurisdiction over the devices in our living rooms.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So ended the saga of the Broadcast Flag. More or less. In the years since the Flag was proposed, there have been several attempts to reintroduce it through legislation, all failed. And as more and more innovative, open devices like the Neuros OSD enter the market, it gets harder and harder to imagine that Americans will accept a mandate that takes away all that functionality.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But the spirit of the Broadcast Flag lives on. DRM consortia are all the rage now — outfits like AACS LA, the folks who control the DRM in Blu-Ray and HD-DVD, are thriving and making headlines by issuing fatwas against people who publish their secret integers. In Europe, a DRM consortium working under the auspices of the Digital Video Broadcasters Forum (DVB) has just shipped a proposed standard for digital TV DRM that makes the Broadcast Flag look like the work of patchouli-scented infohippies. The DVB proposal would give DRM consortium the ability to define what is and isn’t a valid “household” for the purposes of sharing your video within your “household’s devices.” It limits how long you’re allowed to pause a video for, and allows for restrictions to be put in place for hundreds of years, longer than any copyright system in the world would protect any work for.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If all this stuff seems a little sneaky, underhanded and even illegal to you, you’re not alone. When representatives of nearly all the world’s entertainment, technology, broadcast, satellite and cable companies gather in a room to collude to cripple their offerings, limit their innovation, and restrict the market, regulators take notice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s why the EU is taking a hard look at HD-DVD and Blu-Ray. These systems aren’t designed: they’re governed, and the governors are shadowy group of offshore giants who answer to no one — not even their own members! I once called the DVD-Copy Control Association (DVD-CCA) on behalf of a Time-Warner magazine, Popular Science, for a comment about their DRM. Not only wouldn’t they allow me to speak to a spokesman, the person who denied my request also refused to be identified.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The sausage factory grinds away, but today, more activists than ever are finding ways to participate in the negotiations, slowing them up, making them account for themselves to the public. And so long as you, the technology-buying public, pay attention to what’s going on, the activists will continue to hold back the tide.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Happy Meal Toys versus Copyright: How America chose Hollywood and Wal-Mart, and why it’s doomed us, and how we might survive anyway</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Originally published as “How Hollywood, Congress, And DRM Are Beating Up The American Economy,” InformationWeek, June 11, 2007)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Back in 1985, the Senate was ready to clobber the music industry for exposing America’s impressionable youngsters to sex, drugs and rock-and-roll. Today, the the Attorney General is proposing to give the RIAA legal tools to attack people who attempt infringement.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Through most of America’s history, the US government has been at odds with the entertainment giants, treating them as purveyors of filth. But not anymore: today, the US Trade Rep using America’s political clout to force Russia to institute police inspections of its CD presses (savor the irony: post-Soviet Russia forgoes its hard-won freedom of the press to protect Disney and Universal!).</p>
<p class="calibre1">How did entertainment go from trenchcoat pervert to top trade priority? I blame the “Information Economy.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">No one really knows what “Information Economy” means, but by the early 90s, we knew it was coming. America deployed her least reliable strategic resource to puzzle out what an “information economy” was and to figure out how to ensure America stayed atop the “new economy” — America sent in the futurists.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We make the future in much the same way as we make the past. We don’t remember everything that happened to us, just selective details. We weave our memories together on demand, filling in any empty spaces with the present, which is lying around in great abundance. In Stumbling on Happiness, Harvard psych prof Daniel Gilbert describes an experiment in which people with delicious lunches in front of them are asked to remember their breakfast: overwhelmingly, the people with good lunches have more positive memories of breakfast than those who have bad lunches. We don’t remember breakfast — we look at lunch and superimpose it on breakfast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We make the future in the same way: we extrapolate as much as we can, and whenever we run out of imagination, we just shovel the present into the holes. That’s why our pictures of the future always seem to resemble the present, only moreso.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So the futurists told us about the Information Economy: they took all the “information-based” businesses (music, movies and microcode, in the neat coinage of Neal Stephenson’s 1992 novel Snow Crash) and projected a future in which these would grow to dominate the world’s economies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was only one fly in the ointment: most of the world’s economies consist of poor people who have more time than money, and if there’s any lesson to learn from American college kids, it’s that people with more time than money would rather copy information than pay for it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course they would! Why, when America was aborning, she was a pirate nation, cheerfully copying the inventions of European authors and inventors. Why not? The fledgling revolutionary republic could copy without paying, keep the money on her shores, and enrich herself with the products and ideas of imperial Europe. Of course, once the US became a global hitter in the creative industries, out came the international copyright agreements: the US signed agreements to protect British authors in exchange for reciprocal agreements from the Brits to protect American authors.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s hard to see why a developing country would opt to export its GDP to a rich country when it could get the same benefit by mere copying. The US would have to sweeten the pot.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The pot-sweetener is the elimination of international trade-barriers. Historically, the US has used tariffs to limit the import of manufactured goods from abroad, and to encourage the import of raw materials from abroad. Generally speaking, rich countries import poor countries’ raw materials, process them into manufactured goods, and export them again. Globally speaking, if your country imports sugar and exports sugar cane, chances are you’re poor. If your country imports wood and sells paper, chances are you’re rich.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1995, the US signed onto the World Trade Organization and its associated copyright and patent agreement, the TRIPS Agreement, and the American economy was transformed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Any fellow signatory to the WTO/TRIPS can export manufactured goods to the USA without any tariffs. If it costs you $5 to manufacture and ship a plastic bucket from your factory in Shenjin Province to the USA, you can sell it for $6 and turn a $1 profit. And if it costs an American manufacturer $10 to make the same bucket, the American manufacturer is out of luck.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The kicker is this: if you want to export your finished goods to America, you have to sign up to protect American copyrights in your own country. Quid pro quo.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The practical upshot, 12 years later, is that most American manufacturing has gone belly up, Wal-Mart is filled with Happy Meal toys and other cheaply manufactured plastic goods, and the whole world has signed onto US copyright laws.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But signing onto those laws doesn’t mean you’ll enforce them. Sure, where a country is really over a barrel (cough, Russia, cough), they’ll take the occasional pro forma step to enforce US copyrights, no matter how ridiculous and totalitarian it makes them appear. But with the monthly Russian per-capita GDP hovering at $200, it’s just not plausible that Russians are going to start paying $15 for a CD, nor is it likely that they’ll stop listening to music until their economy picks up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But the real action is in China, where pressing bootleg media is a national sport. China keeps promising that it will do something about this, but it’s not like the US has any recourse if China drags its heels. Trade courts may find against China, but China holds all the cards. The US can’t afford to abandon Chinese manufacturing (and no one will vote for the politician who hextuples the cost of WiFi cards, brassieres, iPods, staplers, yoga mats, and spatulas by cutting off trade with China). The Chinese can just sit tight.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The futurists were just plain wrong. An “information economy” can’t be based on selling information. Information technology makes copying information easier and easier. The more IT you have, the less control you have over the bits you send out into the world. It will never, ever, EVER get any harder to copy information from here on in. The information economy is about selling everything except information.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The US traded its manufacturing sector’s health for its entertainment industry, hoping that Police Academy sequels could take the place of the rustbelt. The US bet wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But like a losing gambler who keeps on doubling down, the US doesn’t know when to quit. It keeps meeting with its entertainment giants, asking how US foreign and domestic policy can preserve its business-model. Criminalize 70 million American file-sharers? Check. Turn the world’s copyright laws upside down? Check. Cream the IT industry by criminalizing attempted infringement? Check.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’ll never work. It can never work. There will always be an entertainment industry, but not one based on excluding access to published digital works. Once it’s in the world, it’ll be copied. This is why I give away digital copies of my books and make money on the printed editions: I’m not going to stop people from copying the electronic editions, so I might as well treat them as an enticement to buy the printed objects.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But there is an information economy. You don’t even need a computer to participate. My barber, an avowed technophobe who rebuilds antique motorcycles and doesn’t own a PC, benefited from the information economy when I found him by googling for barbershops in my neighborhood.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Teachers benefit from the information economy when they share lesson plans with their colleagues around the world by email. Doctors benefit from the information economy when they move their patient files to efficient digital formats. Insurance companies benefit from the information economy through better access to fresh data used in the preparation of actuarial tables. Marinas benefit from the information economy when office-slaves look up the weekend’s weather online and decide to skip out on Friday for a weekend’s sailing. Families of migrant workers benefit from the information economy when their sons and daughters wire cash home from a convenience store Western Union terminal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This stuff generates wealth for those who practice it. It enriches the country and improves our lives.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And it can peacefully co-exist with movies, music and microcode, but not if Hollywood gets to call the shots. Where IT managers are expected to police their networks and systems for unauthorized copying — no matter what that does to productivity — they cannot co-exist. Where our operating systems are rendered inoperable by “copy protection,” they cannot co-exist. Where our educational institutions are turned into conscript enforcers for the record industry, they cannot co-exist.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The information economy is all around us. The countries that embrace it will emerge as global economic superpowers. The countries that stubbornly hold to the simplistic idea that the information economy is about selling information will end up at the bottom of the pile.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Why Is Hollywood Making A Sequel To The Napster Wars?</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Originally published in InformationWeek, August 14, 2007)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hollywood loves sequels — they’re generally a safe bet, provided that you’re continuing an already successful franchise. But you’d have to be nuts to shoot a sequel to a disastrous flop — say, The Adventures of Pluto Nash or Town and Country.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As disastrous as Pluto Nash was, it was practically painless when compared to the Napster debacle. That shipwreck took place six years ago, when the record industry succeeded in shutting down the pioneering file-sharing service, and they show no signs of recovery.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2">The disastrous thing about Napster wasn’t that it it existed, but rather that the record industry managed to kill it.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Napster had an industry-friendly business-model: raise venture capital, start charging for access to the service, and then pay billions of dollars to the record companies in exchange for licenses to their works. Yes, they kicked this plan off without getting permission from the record companies, but that’s not so unusual. The record companies followed the same business plan a hundred years ago, when they started recording sheet music without permission, raising capital and garnering profits, and <i class="calibre2">then</i> working out a deal to pay the composers for the works they’d built their fortunes on.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Napster’s plan was plausible. They had the fastest-adopted technology in the history of the world, garnering 52,000,000 users in 18 months — more than had voted for either candidate in the preceding US election! — and discovering, via surveys, that a sizable portion would happily pay between $10 and $15 a month for the service. What’s more, Napster’s architecture included a gatekeeper that could be used to lock-out non-paying users.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The record industry refused to deal. Instead, they sued, bringing Napster to its knees. Bertelsmann bought Napster out of the ensuing bankruptcy, a pattern that was followed by other music giants, like Universal, who slayed MP3.com in the courts, then brought home the corpse on the cheap, running it as an internal project.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After that, the record companies had a field day: practically every venture-funded P2P company went down, and millions of dollars were funneled from the tech venture capital firms to Sand Hill Road to the RIAA’s members, using P2P companies and the courts as conduits.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But the record companies weren’t ready to replace these services with equally compelling alternatives. Instead, they fielded inferior replacements like PressPlay, with limited catalog, high prices, and anti-copying technology (digital rights management, or DRM) that alienated users by the millions by treating them like crooks instead of customers. These half-baked ventures did untold damage to the record companies and their parent firms.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Just look at Sony: they should have been at the top of the heap. They produce some of the world’s finest, best-designed electronics. They own one of the largest record labels in the world. The synergy should have been incredible. Electronics would design the walkmen, music would take care of catalog, and marketing would sell it all.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You know the joke about European hell? The English do the cooking, the Germans are the lovers, the Italians are the police and the French run the government. With Sony, it seemed like music was designing the walkmen, marketing was doing the catalog, and electronic was in charge of selling. Sony’s portable players — the MusicClip and others — were so crippled by anti-copying technology that they couldn’t even play MP3s, and the music selection at Sony services like PressPlay was anemic, expensive, and equally hobbled. Sony isn’t even a name in the portable audio market anymore — today’s walkman is an iPod.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, Sony still has a record-label — for now. But sales are falling, and the company is reeling from the 2005 “rootkit” debacle, where in deliberately infected eight million music CDs with a hacker tool called a rootkit, compromising over 500,000 US computer networks, including military and government networks, all in a (failed) bid to stop copying of its CDs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The public wasn’t willing to wait for Sony and the rest to wake up and offer a service that was as compelling, exciting and versatile as Napster. Instead, they flocked to a new generation of services like Kazaa and the various Gnutella networks. Kazaa’s business model was to set up offshore, on the tiny Polynesian island of Vanuatu, and bundle spyware with its software, making its profits off of fees from spyware crooks. Kazaa didn’t want to pay billions for record industry licenses — they used the international legal and finance system to hopelessly snarl the RIAA’s members through half a decade of wild profitability. The company was eventually brought to ground, but the founders walked away and started Skype and then Joost.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meantime, dozens of other services had sprung up to fill Kazaa’s niche — AllofMP3, the notorious Russian site, was eventually killed through intervention of the US Trade Representative and the WTO, and was reborn practically the next day under a new name.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s been eight years since Sean Fanning created Napster in his college dorm-room. Eight years later, there isn’t a single authorized music service that can compete with the original Napster. Record sales are down every year, and digital music sales aren’t filling in the crater. The record industry has contracted to four companies, and it may soon be three if EMI can get regulatory permission to put itself on the block.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The sue-em-all-and-let-God-sort-em-out plan was a flop in the box office, a flop in home video, and a flop overseas. So why is Hollywood shooting a remake?</p>
<p class="scenebreak">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">YouTube, 2007, bears some passing similarity to Napster, 2001. Founded by a couple guys in a garage, rocketed to popular success, heavily capitalized by a deep-pocketed giant. Its business model? Turn popularity into dollars and offer a share to the rightsholders whose works they’re using. This is an historically sound plan: cable operators got rich by retransmitting broadcasts without permission, and once they were commercial successes, they sat down to negotiate to pay for those copyrights (just as the record companies negotiated with composers *after* they’d gotten rich selling records bearing those compositions).</p>
<p class="calibre1">YouTube 07 has another similarity to Napster 01: it is being sued by entertainment companies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Only this time, it’s not (just) the record industry. Broadcasters, movie studios, anyone who makes video or audio is getting in on the act. I recently met an NBC employee who told me that he thought that a severe, punishing legal judgment would send a message to the tech industry not to field this kind of service anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Let’s hope he’s wrong. Google — YouTube’s owners — is a grown-up of a company, unusual in a tech industry populated by corporate adolescents. They have lots of money and a sober interest in keeping it. They want to sit down with A/V rightsholders and do a deal. Six years after the Napster verdict, that kind of willingness is in short supply.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of the tech “companies” with an interest in commercializing Internet AV have no interest in sitting down with the studios. They’re either nebulous open source projects (like mythtv, a free hyper-TiVo that skips commercials, downloads and shares videos and is wide open to anyone who wants to modify and improve it), politically motivated anarchists (like ThePirateBay, a Swedish BitTorrent tracker site that has mirrors in three countries with non-interoperable legal systems, where they respond to legal notices by writing sarcastic and profane letters and putting them online), or out-and-out crooks like the bootleggers who use P2P to seed their DVD counterfeiting operations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s not just YouTube. TiVo, who pioneered the personal video recorder, is feeling the squeeze, being systematically locked out of the digital cable and satellite market. Their efforts to add a managed TiVoToGo service were attacked by the rightsholders who fought at the FCC to block them. Cable/satellite operators and the studios would much prefer the public to transition to “bundled” PVRs that come with your TV service.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These boxes are owned by the cable/satellite companies, who have absolute control over them. Time-Warner has been known to remotely delete stored episodes of shows just before the DVD ships, and many operators have started using “flags” that tell recorders not to allow fast-forwarding, or to prevent recording altogether.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The reason that YouTube and TiVo are more popular than ThePirateBay and mythtv is that they’re the easiest way for the public to get what it wants — the video we want, the way we want it. We use these services because they’re like the original Napster: easy, well-designed, functional.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But if the entertainment industry squeezes these players out, ThePirateBay and mythtv are right there, waiting to welcome us in with open arms. ThePirateBay has already announced that it is launching a YouTube competitor with no-plugin, in-browser viewing. Plenty of entrepreneurs are looking at easing the pain and cast of setting up your own mythtv box. The only reason that the barriers to BitTorrent and mythtv exist is that it hasn’t been worth anyone’s while to capitalize projects to bring them down. But once the legit competitors of these services are killed, look out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The thing is, the public doesn’t want managed services with limited rights. We don’t want to be stuck using approved devices in approved ways. We never have — we are the spiritual descendants of the customers for “illegal” record albums and “illegal” cable TV. The demand signal won’t go away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s no good excuse for going into production on a sequel to The Napster Wars. We saw that movie. We know how it turns out. Every Christmas, we get articles about how this was the worst Christmas ever for CDs. You know what? CD sales are <i class="calibre2">never</i> going to improve. CDs have been rendered obsolete by Internet distribution — and the record industry has locked itself out of the only profitable, popular music distribution systems yet invented.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Companies like Google/YouTube and TiVo are rarities: tech companies that want to do deals. They need to be cherished by entertainment companies, not sued.</p>

<p class="calibre1">You DO Like Reading Off a Computer Screen</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Originally published in Locus Magazine, March 2007)</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t like reading off a computer screen” — it’s a clich� of the e-book world. It means “I don’t read novels off of computer screens” (or phones, or PDAs, or dedicated e-book readers), and often as not the person who says it is someone who, in fact, spends every hour that Cthulhu sends reading off a computer screen. It’s like watching someone shovel Mars Bars into his gob while telling you how much he hates chocolate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But I know what you mean. You don’t like reading long-form works off of a computer screen. I understand perfectly — in the ten minutes since I typed the first word in the paragraph above, I’ve checked my mail, deleted two spams, checked an image-sharing community I like, downloaded a YouTube clip of Stephen Colbert complaining about the iPhone (pausing my MP3 player first), cleared out my RSS reader, and then returned to write this paragraph.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is not an ideal environment in which to concentrate on long-form narrative (sorry, one sec, gotta blog this guy who’s made cardboard furniture) (wait, the Colbert clip’s done, gotta start the music up) (19 more RSS items). But that’s not to say that it’s not an entertainment medium — indeed, practically everything I do on the computer entertains the hell out of me. It’s nearly all text-based, too. Basically, what I do on the computer is pleasure-reading. But it’s a fundamentally more scattered, splintered kind of pleasure. Computers have their own cognitive style, and it’s not much like the cognitive style invented with the first modern novel (one sec, let me google that and confirm it), Don Quixote, some 400 years ago.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The novel is an invention, one that was engendered by technological changes in information display, reproduction, and distribution. The cognitive style of the novel is different from the cognitive style of the legend. The cognitive style of the computer is different from the cognitive style of the novel.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Computers want you to do lots of things with them. Networked computers doubly so — they (another RSS item) have a million ways of asking for your attention, and just as many ways of rewarding it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s a persistent fantasy/nightmare in the publishing world of the advent of very sharp, very portable computer screens. In the fantasy version, this creates an infinite new market for electronic books, and we all get to sell the rights to our work all over again. In the nightmare version, this leads to runaway piracy, and no one ever gets to sell a novel again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I think they’re both wrong. The infinitely divisible copyright ignores the “decision cost” borne by users who have to decide, over and over again, whether they want to spend a millionth of a cent on a millionth of a word — no one buys newspapers by the paragraph, even though most of us only read a slim fraction of any given paper. A super-sharp, super-portable screen would be used to read all day long, but most of us won’t spend most of our time reading anything recognizable as a book on them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Take the record album. Everything about it is technologically pre-determined. The technology of the LP demanded artwork to differentiate one package from the next. The length was set by the groove density of the pressing plants and playback apparatus. The dynamic range likewise. These factors gave us the idea of the 40-to-60-minute package, split into two acts, with accompanying artwork. Musicians were encouraged to create works that would be enjoyed as a unitary whole for a protracted period — think of Dark Side of the Moon, or Sgt. Pepper’s.</p>
<p class="calibre1">No one thinks about albums today. Music is now divisible to the single, as represented by an individual MP3, and then subdivisible into snippets like ringtones and samples. When recording artists demand that their works be considered as a whole — like when Radiohead insisted that the iTunes Music Store sell their whole album as a single, indivisible file that you would have to listen to all the way through — they sound like cranky throwbacks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The idea of a 60-minute album is as weird in the Internet era as the idea of sitting through 15 hours of Der Ring des Nibelungen was 20 years ago. There are some anachronisms who love their long-form opera, but the real action is in the more fluid stuff that can slither around on hot wax — and now the superfluid droplets of MP3s and samples. Opera survives, but it is a tiny sliver of a much bigger, looser music market. The future composts the past: old operas get mounted for living anachronisms; Andrew Lloyd Webber picks up the rest of the business.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Or look at digital video. We’re watching more digital video, sooner, than anyone imagined. But we’re watching it in three-minute chunks from YouTube. The video’s got a pause button so you can stop it when the phone rings and a scrubber to go back and forth when you miss something while answering an IM.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And attention spans don’t increase when you move from the PC to a handheld device. These things have less capacity for multitasking than real PCs, and the network connections are slower and more expensive. But they are fundamentally multitasking devices — you can always stop reading an e-book to play a hand of solitaire that is interrupted by a phone call — and their social context is that they are used in public places, with a million distractions. It is socially acceptable to interrupt someone who is looking at a PDA screen. By contrast, the TV room — a whole room for TV! — is a shrine where none may speak until the commercial airs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The problem, then, isn’t that screens aren’t sharp enough to read novels off of. The problem is that novels aren’t screeny enough to warrant protracted, regular reading on screens.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Electronic books are a wonderful adjunct to print books. It’s great to have a couple hundred novels in your pocket when the plane doesn’t take off or the line is too long at the post office. It’s cool to be able to search the text of a novel to find a beloved passage. It’s excellent to use a novel socially, sending it to your friends, pasting it into your sig file.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But the numbers tell their own story — people who read off of screens all day long buy lots of print books and read them primarily on paper. There are some who prefer an all-electronic existence (I’d like to be able to get rid of the objects after my first reading, but keep the e-books around for reference), but they’re in a tiny minority.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s a generation of web writers who produce “pleasure reading” on the web. Some are funny. Some are touching. Some are enraging. Most dwell in Sturgeon’s 90th percentile and below. They’re not writing novels. If they were, they wouldn’t be web writers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mostly, we can read just enough of a free e-book to decide whether to buy it in hardcopy — but not enough to substitute the e-book for the hardcopy. Like practically everything in marketing and promotion, the trick is to find the form of the work that serves as enticement, not replacement.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sorry, got to go — eight more e-mails.</p>

<p class="calibre1">How Do You Protect Artists?</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Originally published in The Guardian as “Online censorship hurts us all,” Tuesday, Oct 2, 2007)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Artists have lots of problems. We get plagiarized, ripped off by publishers, savaged by critics, counterfeited — and we even get our works copied by “pirates” who give our stuff away for free online.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But no matter how bad these problems get, they’re a distant second to the gravest, most terrifying problem an artist can face: censorship.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s one thing to be denied your credit or compensation, but it’s another thing entirely to have your work suppressed, burned or banned. You’d never know it, however, judging from the state of the law surrounding the creation and use of internet publishing tools.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Since 1995, every single legislative initiative on this subject in the UK’s parliament, the European parliament and the US Congress has focused on making it easier to suppress “illegitimate” material online. From libel to copyright infringement, from child porn to anti-terror laws, our legislators have approached the internet with a single-minded focus on seeing to it that bad material is expeditiously removed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And that’s the rub. I’m certainly no fan of child porn or hate speech, but every time a law is passed that reduces the burden of proof on those who would remove material from the internet, artists’ fortunes everywhere are endangered.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Take the US’s 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which has equivalents in every European state that has implemented the 2001 European Union Copyright Directive. The DMCA allows anyone to have any document on the internet removed, simply by contacting its publisher and asserting that the work infringes his copyright.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The potential for abuse is obvious, and the abuse has been widespread: from the Church of Scientology to companies that don’t like what reporters write about them, DMCA takedown notices have fast become the favorite weapon in the cowardly bully’s arsenal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But takedown notices are just the start. While they can help silence critics and suppress timely information, they’re not actually very effective at stopping widespread copyright infringement. Viacom sent over 100,000 takedown notices to YouTube last February, but seconds after it was all removed, new users uploaded it again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even these takedown notices were sloppily constructed: they included videos of friends eating at barbecue restaurants and videos of independent bands performing their own work. As a Recording Industry Association of America spokesman quipped, “When you go trawling with a net, you catch a few dolphins.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Viacom and others want hosting companies and online service providers to preemptively evaluate all the material that their users put online, holding it to ensure that it doesn’t infringe copyright before they release it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This notion is impractical in the extreme, for at least two reasons. First, an exhaustive list of copyrighted works would be unimaginably huge, as every single creative work is copyrighted from the instant that it is created and “fixed in a tangible medium”.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Second, even if such a list did exist, it would be trivial to defeat, simply by introducing small changes to the infringing copies, as spammers do with the text of their messages in order to evade spam filters.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, the spam wars have some important lessons to teach us here. Like copyrighted works, spams are infinitely varied and more are being created every second. Any company that could identify spam messages — including permutations and variations on existing spams — could write its own ticket to untold billions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of the smartest, most dedicated engineers on the planet devote every waking hour to figuring out how to spot spam before it gets delivered. If your inbox is anything like mine, you’ll agree that the war is far from won.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If the YouTubes of the world are going to prevent infringement, they’re going to have to accomplish this by hand-inspecting every one of the tens of billions of blog posts, videos, text-files, music files and software uploads made to every single server on the internet.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And not just cursory inspections, either — these inspections will have to be undertaken by skilled, trained specialists (who’d better be talented linguists, too — how many English speakers can spot an infringement in Urdu?).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Such experts don’t come cheap, which means that you can anticipate a terrible denuding of the fertile jungle of internet hosting companies that are primary means by which tens of millions of creative people share the fruits of their labor with their fans and colleagues.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It would be a great Sovietisation of the world’s digital printing presses, a contraction of a glorious anarchy of expression into a regimented world of expensive and narrow venues for art.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It would be a death knell for the kind of focused, noncommercial material whose authors couldn’t fit the bill for a “managed” service’s legion of lawyers, who would be replaced by more of the same — the kind of lowest common denominator rubbish that fills the cable channels today.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And the worst of it is, we’re marching toward this “solution” in the name of protecting artists. Gee, thanks.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">$$$$</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s the Information Economy, Stupid</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Originally published in The Guardian as “Free data sharing is here to stay,” September 18, 2007)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Since the 1970s, pundits have predicted a transition to an “information economy.” The vision of an economy based on information seized the imaginations of the world’s governments. For decades now, they have been creating policies to “protect” information — stronger copyright laws, international treaties on patents and trademarks, treaties to protect anti-copying technology.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The thinking is simple: an information economy must be based on buying and selling information. Therefore, we need policies to make it harder to get access to information unless you’ve paid for it. That means that we have to make it harder for you to share information, even after you’ve paid for it. Without the ability to fence off your information property, you can’t have an information market to fuel the information economy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But this is a tragic case of misunderstanding a metaphor. Just as the industrial economy wasn’t based on making it harder to get access to machines, the information economy won’t be based on making it harder to get access to information. Indeed, the opposite seems to be true: the more IT we have, the easier it is to access any given piece of information — for better or for worse.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It used to be that copy-prevention companies’ strategies went like this: “We’ll make it easier to buy a copy of this data than to make an unauthorized copy of it. That way, only the uber-nerds and the cash-poor/time-rich classes will bother to copy instead of buy.” But every time a PC is connected to the Internet and its owner is taught to use search tools like Google (or The Pirate Bay), a third option appears: you can just download a copy from the Internet. Every techno-literate participant in the information economy can choose to access any data, without having to break the anti-copying technology, just by searching for the cracked copy on the public Internet. If there’s one thing we can be sure of, it’s that an information economy will increase the technological literacy of its participants.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As I write this, I am sitting in a hotel room in Shanghai, behind the Great Firewall of China. Theoretically, I can’t access blogging services that carry negative accounts of Beijing’s doings, like Wordpress, Blogspot and Livejournal, nor the image-sharing site Flickr, nor Wikipedia. The (theoretically) omnipotent bureaucrats of the local Minitrue have deployed their finest engineering talent to stop me. Well, these cats may be able to order political prisoners executed and their organs harvested for Party members, but they’ve totally failed to keep Chinese people (and big-nose tourists like me) off the world’s Internet. The WTO is rattling its sabers at China today, demanding that they figure out how to stop Chinese people from looking at Bruce Willis movies without permission — but the Chinese government can’t even figure out how to stop Chinese people from looking at seditious revolutionary tracts online.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And, of course, as Paris Hilton, the Church of Scientology and the King of Thailand have discovered, taking a piece of information off the Internet is like getting food coloring out of a swimming pool. Good luck with that.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To see the evidence of the real information economy, look to all the economic activity that the Internet enables — not the stuff that it impedes. All the commerce conducted by salarymen who can book their own flights with Expedia instead of playing blind-man’s bluff with a travel agent (“Got any flights after 4PM to Frankfurt?”). All the garage crafters selling their goods on Etsy.com. All the publishers selling obscure books through Amazon that no physical bookstore was willing to carry. The salwar kameez tailors in India selling bespoke clothes to westerners via eBay, without intervention by a series of skimming intermediaries. The Internet-era musicians who use the net to pack venues all over the world by giving away their recordings on social services like MySpace. Hell, look at my last barber, in Los Angeles: the man doesn’t use a PC, but I found him by googling for “barbers” with my postcode — the information economy is driving his cost of customer acquisition to zero, and he doesn’t even have to actively participate in it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Better access to more information is the hallmark of the information economy. The more IT we have, the more skill we have, the faster our networks get and the better our search tools get, the more economic activity the information economy generates. Many of us sell information in the information economy — I sell my printed books by giving away electronic books, lawyers and architects and consultants are in the information business and they drum up trade with Google ads, and Google is nothing but an info-broker — but none of us rely on curtailing access to information. Like a bottled water company, we compete with free by supplying a superior service, not by eliminating the competition.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The world’s governments might have bought into the old myth of the information economy, but not so much that they’re willing to ban the PC and the Internet.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Downloads Give Amazon Jungle Fever</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Originally published in The Guardian, December 11, 2007)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Let me start by saying that I love Amazon. I buy everything from books to clothes to electronics to medication to food to batteries to toys to furniture to baby supplies from the company. I once even bought an ironing board on Amazon. No company can top them for ease of use or for respecting consumer rights when it comes to refunds, ensuring satisfaction, and taking good care of loyal customers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a novelist, I couldn’t be happier about Amazon’s existence. Not only does Amazon have a set of superb recommendation tools that help me sell books, but it also has an affiliate program that lets me get up to 8.5% in commissions for sales of my books through the site - nearly doubling my royalty rate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a consumer advocate and activist, I’m delighted by almost every public policy initiative from Amazon. When the Author’s Guild tried to get Amazon to curtail its used-book market, the company refused to back down. Founder Jeff Bezos (who is a friend of mine) even wrote, “when someone buys a book, they are also buying the right to resell that book, to loan it out, or to even give it away if they want. Everyone understands this.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">More recently, Amazon stood up to the US government, who’d gone on an illegal fishing expedition for terrorists (TERRORISTS! TERRORISTS! TERRORISTS!) and asked Amazon to turn over the purchasing history of 24,000 Amazon customers. The company spent a fortune fighting for our rights, and won.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It also has a well-deserved reputation for taking care over copyright “takedown” notices for the material that its customers post on its site, discarding ridiculous claims rather than blindly acting on every single notice, no matter how frivolous.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But for all that, it has to be said: Whenever Amazon tries to sell a digital download, it turns into one of the dumbest companies on the web.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Take the Kindle, the $400 handheld ebook reader that Amazon shipped recently, to vast, ringing indifference.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The device is cute enough - in a clumsy, overpriced, generation-one kind of way - but the early adopter community recoiled in horror at the terms of service and anti-copying technology that infected it. Ebooks that you buy through the Kindle can’t be lent or resold (remember, “when someone buys a book, they are also buying the right to resell that book…Everyone understands this.”)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mark Pilgrim’s “The Future of Reading” enumerates five other Kindle showstoppers: Amazon can change your ebooks without notifying you or getting your permission; and if you violate any of the “agreement”, it can delete your ebooks, even if you’ve paid for them, and you get no appeal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s not just the Kindle, either. Amazon Unbox, the semi-abortive video download service, shipped with terms of service that included your granting permission for Amazon to install any software on your computer, to spy on you, to delete your videos, to delete any other file on your hard drive, to deny you access to your movies if you lose them in a crash. This comes from the company that will cheerfully ship you a replacement DVD if you email them and tell them that the one you just bought never turned up in the post.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even Amazon’s much-vaunted MP3 store comes with terms of service that prevent lending and reselling.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I am mystified by this. Amazon is the kind of company that every etailer should study and copy - the gold standard for e-commerce. You’d think that if there was any company that would intuitively get the web, it would be Amazon.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What’s more, this is a company that stands up to rightsholder groups, publishers and the US government - but only when it comes to physical goods. Why is it that whenever a digital sale is in the offing, Amazon rolls over on its back and wets itself?</p>

<p class="calibre1">What’s the Most Important Right Creators Have?</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Originally published as “How Big Media’s Copyright Campaigns Threaten Internet Free Expression,” InformationWeek, November 5, 2007)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Any discussion of “creator’s rights” is likely to be limited to talk about copyright, but copyright is just a side-dish for creators: the most important right we have is the right to free expression. And these two rights are always in tension.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Take Viacom’s claims against YouTube. The entertainment giant says that YouTube has been profiting from the fact that YouTube users upload clips from Viacom shows, and they demand that YouTube take steps to prevent this from happening in the future. YouTube actually offered to do something very like this: they invited Viacom and other rightsholders to send them all the clips they wanted kept offline, and promised to programatically detect these clips and interdict them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But Viacom rejected this offer. Rather, the company wants YouTube to just figure it out, determine a priori which video clips are being presented with permission and which ones are not. After all, Viacom does the very same thing: it won’t air clips until a battalion of lawyers have investigated them and determined whether they are lawful.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But the Internet is not cable television. Net-based hosting outfits — including YouTube, Flickr, Blogger, Scribd, and the Internet Archive — offer free publication venues to all comers, enabling anyone to publish anything. In 1998’s Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Congress considered the question of liability for these companies and decided to offer them a mixed deal: hosting companies don’t need to hire a million lawyers to review every blog-post before it goes live, but rightsholders can order them to remove any infringing material from the net just by sending them a notice that the material infringes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This deal enabled hosting companies to offer free platforms for publication and expression to everyone. But it also allowed anyone to censor the Internet, just by making claims of infringement, without offering any evidence to support those claims, without having to go to court to prove their claims (this has proven to be an attractive nuisance, presenting an irresistible lure to anyone with a beef against an online critic, from the Church of Scientology to Diebold’s voting machines division).</p>
<p class="calibre1">The proposal for online hosts to figure out what infringes and what doesn’t is wildly impractical. Under most countries’ copyright laws, creative works receive a copyright from the moment that they are “fixed in a tangible medium” (hard drives count), and this means that the pool of copyrighted works is so large as to be practically speaking infinite. Knowing whether a work is copyrighted, who holds the copyright, and whether a posting is made with the rightsholder’s permission (or in accord with each nation’s varying ideas about fair use) is impossible. The only way to be sure is to start from the presumption that each creative work is infringing, and then make each Internet user prove, to some lawyer’s satisfaction, that she has the right to post each drib of content that appears on the Web.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Imagine that such a system were the law of the land. There’s no way Blogger or YouTube or Flickr could afford to offer free hosting to their users. Rather, all these hosted services would have to charge enough for access to cover the scorching legal bills associated with checking all material. And not just the freebies, either: your local ISP, the servers hosting your company’s website or your page for family genealogy: they’d all have to do the same kind of continuous checking and re-checking of every file you publish with them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It would be the end of any publication that couldn’t foot the legal bills to get off the ground. The multibillion-page Internet would collapse into the homogeneous world of cable TV (remember when we thought that a “500-channel universe” would be unimaginably broad? Imagine an Internet with only 500 “channels!”). From Amazon to Ask A Ninja, from Blogger to The Everlasting Blort, every bit of online content is made possible by removing the cost of paying lawyers to act as the Internet’s gatekeepers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is great news for artists. The traditional artist’s lament is that our publishers have us over a barrel, controlling the narrow and vital channels for making works available — from big gallery owners to movie studios to record labels to New York publishers. That’s why artists have such a hard time negotiating a decent deal for themselves (for example, most beginning recording artists have to agree to have money deducted from their royalty statements for “breakage” of records en route to stores — and these deductions are also levied against digital sales through the iTunes Store!).</p>
<p class="calibre1">But, thanks to the web, artists have more options than ever. The Internet’s most popular video podcasts aren’t associated with TV networks (with all the terrible, one-sided deals that would entail), rather, they’re independent programs like RocketBoom, Homestar Runner, or the late, lamented Ze Frank Show. These creators — along with all the musicians, writers, and other artists using the net to earn their living — were able to write their own ticket. Today, major artists like Radiohead and Madonna are leaving the record labels behind and trying novel, net-based ways of promoting their work.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And it’s not just the indies who benefit: the existence of successful independent artists creates fantastic leverage for artists who negotiate with the majors. More and more, the big media companies’ “like it or leave it” bargaining stance is being undermined by the possibility that the next big star will shrug, turn on her heel, and make her fortune without the big companies’ help. This has humbled the bigs, making their deals better and more artist-friendly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bargaining leverage is just for starters. The greatest threat that art faces is suppression. Historically, artists have struggled just to make themselves heard, just to safeguard the right to express themselves. Censorship is history’s greatest enemy of art. A limited-liability Web is a Web where anyone can post anything and reach <i class="calibre2">everyone</i>.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What’s more, this privilege isn’t limited to artists. All manner of communication, from the personal introspection in public “diaries” to social chatter on MySpace and Facebook, are now possible. Some artists have taken the bizarre stance that this “trivial” matter is unimportant and thus a poor excuse for allowing hosted services to exist in the first place. This is pretty arrogant: a society where only artists are allowed to impart “important” messages and where the rest of us are supposed to shut up about our loves, hopes, aspirations, jokes, family and wants is hardly a democratic paradise.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Artists are in the free expression business, and technology that helps free expression helps artists. When lowering the cost of copyright enforcement raises the cost of free speech, every artist has a duty to speak out. Our ability to make our art is inextricably linked with the billions of Internet users who use the network to talk about their lives.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Giving it Away</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Originally published in Forbes.com, December 2006)</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ve been giving away my books ever since my first novel came out, and boy has it ever made me a bunch of money.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When my first novel, Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, was published by Tor Books in January 2003, I also put the entire electronic text of the novel on the Internet under a Creative Commons License that encouraged my readers to copy it far and wide. Within a day, there were 30,000 downloads from my site (and those downloaders were in turn free to make more copies). Three years and six printings later, more than 700,000 copies of the book have been downloaded from my site. The book’s been translated into more languages than I can keep track of, key concepts from it have been adopted for software projects and there are two competing fan audio adaptations online.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most people who download the book don’t end up buying it, but they wouldn’t have bought it in any event, so I haven’t lost any sales, I’ve just won an audience. A tiny minority of downloaders treat the free e-book as a substitute for the printed book—those are the lost sales. But a much larger minority treat the e-book as an enticement to buy the printed book. They’re gained sales. As long as gained sales outnumber lost sales, I’m ahead of the game. After all, distributing nearly a million copies of my book has cost me nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The thing about an e-book is that it’s a social object. It wants to be copied from friend to friend, beamed from a Palm device, pasted into a mailing list. It begs to be converted to witty signatures at the bottom of e-mails. It is so fluid and intangible that it can spread itself over your whole life. Nothing sells books like a personal recommendation—when I worked in a bookstore, the sweetest words we could hear were “My friend suggested I pick up….” The friend had made the sale for us, we just had to consummate it. In an age of online friendship, e-books trump dead trees for word of mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There are two things that writers ask me about this arrangement: First, does it sell more books, and second, how did you talk your publisher into going for this mad scheme?</p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s no empirical way to prove that giving away books sells more books—but I’ve done this with three novels and a short story collection (and I’ll be doing it with two more novels and another collection in the next year), and my books have consistently outperformed my publisher’s expectations. Comparing their sales to the numbers provided by colleagues suggests that they perform somewhat better than other books from similar writers at similar stages in their careers. But short of going back in time and re-releasing the same books under the same circumstances without the free e-book program, there’s no way to be sure.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What is certain is that every writer who’s tried giving away e-books to sell books has come away satisfied and ready to do it some more.</p>
<p class="calibre1">How did I talk Tor Books into letting me do this? It’s not as if Tor is a spunky dotcom upstart. They’re the largest science fiction publisher in the world, and they’re a division of the German publishing giant Holtzbrinck. They’re not patchouli-scented infohippies who believe that information wants to be free. Rather, they’re canny assessors of the world of science fiction, perhaps the most social of all literary genres. Science fiction is driven by organized fandom, volunteers who put on hundreds of literary conventions in every corner of the globe, every weekend of the year. These intrepid promoters treat books as markers of identity and as cultural artifacts of great import. They evangelize the books they love, form subcultures around them, cite them in political arguments, sometimes they even rearrange their lives and jobs around them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What’s more, science fiction’s early adopters defined the social character of the Internet itself. Given the high correlation between technical employment and science fiction reading, it was inevitable that the first nontechnical discussion on the Internet would be about science fiction. The online norms of idle chatter, fannish organizing, publishing and leisure are descended from SF fandom, and if any literature has a natural home in cyberspace, it’s science fiction, the literature that coined the very word “cyberspace.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, science fiction was the first form of widely pirated literature online, through “bookwarez” channels that contained books that had been hand-scanned, a page at a time, converted to digital text and proofread. Even today, the mostly widely pirated literature online is SF.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing could make me more sanguine about the future. As publisher Tim O’Reilly wrote in his seminal essay, Piracy is Progressive Taxation, “being well-enough known to be pirated [is] a crowning achievement.” I’d rather stake my future on a literature that people care about enough to steal than devote my life to a form that has no home in the dominant medium of the century.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What about that future? Many writers fear that in the future, electronic books will come to substitute more readily for print books, due to changing audiences and improved technology. I am skeptical of this—the codex format has endured for centuries as a simple and elegant answer to the affordances demanded by print, albeit for a relatively small fraction of the population. Most people aren’t and will never be readers—but the people who are readers will be readers forever, and they are positively pervy for paper.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But say it does come to pass that electronic books are all anyone wants.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I don’t think it’s practical to charge for copies of electronic works. Bits aren’t ever going to get harder to copy. So we’ll have to figure out how to charge for something else. That’s not to say you can’t charge for a copy-able bit, but you sure can’t force a reader to pay for access to information anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This isn’t the first time creative entrepreneurs have gone through one of these transitions. Vaudeville performers had to transition to radio, an abrupt shift from having perfect control over who could hear a performance (if they don’t buy a ticket, you throw them out) to no control whatsoever (any family whose 12-year-old could build a crystal set, the day’s equivalent of installing file-sharing software, could tune in). There were business models for radio, but predicting them a priori wasn’t easy. Who could have foreseen that radio’s great fortunes would be had through creating a blanket license, securing a Congressional consent decree, chartering a collecting society and inventing a new form of statistical mathematics to fund it?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Predicting the future of publishing—should the wind change and printed books become obsolete—is just as hard. I don’t know how writers would earn their living in such a world, but I do know that I’ll never find out by turning my back on the Internet. By being in the middle of electronic publishing, by watching what hundreds of thousands of my readers do with my e-books, I get better market intelligence than I could through any other means. As does my publisher. As serious as I am about continuing to work as a writer for the foreseeable future, Tor Books and Holtzbrinck are just as serious. They’ve got even more riding on the future of publishing than me. So when I approached my publisher with this plan to give away books to sell books, it was a no-brainer for them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s good business for me, too. This “market research” of giving away e-books sells printed books. What’s more, having my books more widely read opens many other opportunities for me to earn a living from activities around my writing, such as the Fulbright Chair I got at USC this year, this high-paying article in Forbes, speaking engagements and other opportunities to teach, write and license my work for translation and adaptation. My fans’ tireless evangelism for my work doesn’t just sell books—it sells me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The golden age of hundreds of writers who lived off of nothing but their royalties is bunkum. Throughout history, writers have relied on day jobs, teaching, grants, inheritances, translation, licensing and other varied sources to make ends meet. The Internet not only sells more books for me, it also gives me more opportunities to earn my keep through writing-related activities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There has never been a time when more people were reading more words by more authors. The Internet is a literary world of written words. What a fine thing that is for writers.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">$$$$</p>
<p class="calibre1">Science Fiction is the Only Literature People Care Enough About to Steal on the Internet</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Originally published in Locus Magazine, July 2006)</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a science fiction writer, no piece of news could make me more hopeful. It beats the hell out of the alternative — a future where the dominant, pluripotent, ubiquitous medium has no place for science fiction literature.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When radio and records were invented, they were pretty bad news for the performers of the day. Live performance demanded charisma, the ability to really put on a magnetic show in front of a crowd. It didn’t matter how technically accomplished you were: if you stood like a statue on stage, no one wanted to see you do your thing. On the other hand, you succeeded as a mediocre player, provided you attacked your performance with a lot of brio.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Radio was clearly good news for musicians — lots more musicians were able to make lots more music, reaching lots more people and making lots more money. It turned performance into an industry, which is what happens when you add technology to art. But it was terrible news for charismatics. It put them out on the street, stuck them with flipping burgers and driving taxis. They knew it, too. Performers lobbied to have the Marconi radio banned, to send Marconi back to the drawing board, charged with inventing a radio they could charge admission to. “We’re charismatics, we do something as old and holy as the first story told before the first fire in the first cave. What right have you to insist that we should become mere clerks, working in an obscure back-room, leaving you to commune with our audiences on our behalf?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Technology giveth and technology taketh away. Seventy years later, Napster showed us that, as William Gibson noted, “We may be at the end of the brief period during which it is possible to charge for recorded music.” Surely we’re at the end of the period where it’s possible to exclude those who don’t wish to pay. Every song released can be downloaded gratis from a peer-to-peer network (and will shortly get easier to download, as hard-drive price/performance curves take us to a place where all the music ever recorded will fit on a disposable pocket-drive that you can just walk over to a friend’s place and copy).</p>
<p class="calibre1">But have no fear: the Internet makes it possible for recording artists to reach a wider audience than ever dreamt of before. Your potential fans may be spread in a thin, even coat over the world, in a configuration that could never be cost-effective to reach with traditional marketing. But the Internet’s ability to lower the costs for artists to reach their audiences and for audiences to find artists suddenly renders possible more variety in music than ever before.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Those artists can use the Internet to bring people back to the live performances that characterized the heyday of Vaudeville. Use your recordings — which you can’t control — to drive admissions to your performances, which you can control. It’s a model that’s worked great for jam bands like the Grateful Dead and Phish. It’s also a model that won’t work for many of today’s artists; 70 years of evolutionary pressure has selected for artists who are more virtuoso than charismatic, artists optimized for recording-based income instead of performance-based income. “How dare you tell us that we are to be trained monkeys, capering on a stage for your amusement? We’re not charismatics, we’re white-collar workers. We commune with our muses behind closed doors and deliver up our work product when it’s done, through plastic, laser-etched discs. You have no right to demand that we convert to a live-performance economy.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Technology giveth and technology taketh away. As bands on MySpace — who can fill houses and sell hundreds of thousands of discs without a record deal, by connecting individually with fans — have shown, there’s a new market aborning on the Internet for music, one with fewer gatekeepers to creativity than ever before.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s the purpose of copyright, after all: to decentralize who gets to make art. Before copyright, we had patronage: you could make art if the Pope or the king liked the sound of it. That produced some damned pretty ceilings and frescos, but it wasn’t until control of art was given over to the market — by giving publishers a monopoly over the works they printed, starting with the Statute of Anne in 1710 — that we saw the explosion of creativity that investment-based art could create. Industrialists weren’t great arbiters of who could and couldn’t make art, but they were better than the Pope.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Internet is enabling a further decentralization in who gets to make art, and like each of the technological shifts in cultural production, it’s good for some artists and bad for others. The important question is: will it let more people participate in cultural production? Will it further decentralize decision-making for artists?</p>
<p class="calibre1">And for SF writers and fans, the further question is, “Will it be any good to our chosen medium?” Like I said, science fiction is the only literature people care enough about to steal on the Internet. It’s the only literature that regularly shows up, scanned and run through optical character recognition software and lovingly hand-edited on darknet newsgroups, Russian websites, IRC channels and elsewhere (yes, there’s also a brisk trade in comics and technical books, but I’m talking about prose fiction here — though this is clearly a sign of hope for our friends in tech publishing and funnybooks).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some writers are using the Internet’s affinity for SF to great effect. I’ve released every one of my novels under Creative Commons licenses that encourage fans to share them freely and widely — even, in some cases, to remix them and to make new editions of them for use in the developing world. My first novel, Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, is in its sixth printing from Tor, and has been downloaded more than 650,000 times from my website, and an untold number of times from others’ websites.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ve discovered what many authors have also discovered: releasing electronic texts of books drives sales of the print editions. An SF writer’s biggest problem is obscurity, not piracy. Of all the people who chose not to spend their discretionary time and cash on our works today, the great bulk of them did so because they didn’t know they existed, not because someone handed them a free e-book version.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But what kind of artist thrives on the Internet? Those who can establish a personal relationship with their readers — something science fiction has been doing for as long as pros have been hanging out in the con suite instead of the green room. These conversational artists come from all fields, and they combine the best aspects of charisma and virtuosity with charm — the ability to conduct their online selves as part of a friendly salon that establishes a non-substitutable relationship with their audiences. You might find a film, a game, and a book to be equally useful diversions on a slow afternoon, but if the novel’s author is a pal of yours, that’s the one you’ll pick. It’s a competitive advantage that can’t be beat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">See Neil Gaiman’s blog, where he manages the trick of carrying on a conversation with millions. Or Charlie Stross’s Usenet posts. Scalzi’s blogs. J. Michael Straczynski’s presence on Usenet — while in production on Babylon 5, no less — breeding an army of rabid fans ready to fax-bomb recalcitrant TV execs into submission and syndication. See also the MySpace bands selling a million units of their CDs by adding each buyer to their “friends lists.” Watch Eric Flint manage the Baen Bar, and Warren Ellis’s good-natured growling on his sites, lists, and so forth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Not all artists have in them to conduct an online salon with their audiences. Not all Vaudevillians had it in them to transition to radio. Technology giveth and technology taketh away. SF writers are supposed to be soaked in the future, ready to come to grips with it. The future is conversational: when there’s more good stuff that you know about that’s one click away or closer than you will ever click on, it’s not enough to know that some book is good. The least substitutable good in the Internet era is the personal relationship.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Conversation, not content, is king. If you were stranded on a desert island and you opted to bring your records instead of your friends, we’d call you a sociopath. Science fiction writers who can insert themselves into their readers’ conversations will be set for life.</p>

<p class="calibre1">How Copyright Broke</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Originally published in Locus Magazine, September, 2006)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The theory is that if the Internet can’t be controlled, then copyright is dead. The thing is, the Internet is a machine for copying things cheaply, quickly, and with as little control as possible, while copyright is the right to control who gets to make copies, so these two abstractions seem destined for a fatal collision, right?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The idea that copyright confers the exclusive right to control copying, performance, adaptation, and general use of a creative work is a polite fiction that has been mostly harmless throughout its brief history, but which has been laid bare by the Internet, and the disjoint is showing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Theoretically, if I sell you a copy of one of my novels, I’m conferring upon you a property interest in a lump of atoms — the pages of the book — as well as a license to make some reasonable use of the ethereal ideas embedded upon the page, the copyrighted work.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Copyright started with a dispute between Scottish and English publishers, and the first copyright law, 1709’s Statute of Anne, conferred the exclusive right to publish new editions of a book on the copyright holder. It was a fair competition statute, and it was silent on the rights that the copyright holder had in respect of his customers: the readers. Publishers got a legal tool to fight their competitors, a legal tool that made a distinction between the corpus — a physical book — and the spirit — the novel writ on its pages. But this legal nicety was not “customer-facing.” As far as a reader was concerned, once she bought a book, she got the same rights to it as she got to any other physical object, like a potato or a shovel. Of course, the reader couldn’t print a new edition, but this had as much to do with the realities of technology as it did with the law. Printing presses were rare and expensive: telling a 17th-century reader that he wasn’t allowed to print a new edition of a book you sold him was about as meaningful as telling him he wasn’t allowed to have it laser-etched on the surface of the moon. Publishing books wasn’t something readers did.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, until the photocopier came along, it was practically impossible for a member of the audience to infringe copyright in a way that would rise to legal notice. Copyright was like a tank-mine, designed only to go off when a publisher or record company or radio station rolled over it. We civilians couldn’t infringe copyright (many thanks to Jamie Boyle for this useful analogy).</p>
<p class="calibre1">It wasn’t the same for commercial users of copyrighted works. For the most part, a radio station that played a record was expected to secure permission to do so (though this permission usually comes in the form of a government-sanctioned blanket license that cuts through all the expense of negotiating in favor of a single monthly payment that covers all radio play). If you shot a movie, you were expected to get permission for the music you put in it. Critically, there are many uses that commercial users never paid for. Most workplaces don’t pay for the music their employees enjoy while they work. An ad agency that produces a demo reel of recent commercials to use as part of a creative briefing to a designer doesn’t pay for this extremely commercial use. A film company whose set-designer clips and copies from magazines and movies to produce a “mood book” never secures permission nor offers compensation for these uses.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Theoretically, the contours of what you may and may not do without permission are covered under a legal doctrine called “fair use,” which sets out the factors a judge can use to weigh the question of whether an infringement should be punished. While fair use is a vital part of the way that works get made and used, it’s very rare for an unauthorized use to get adjudicated on this basis.</p>
<p class="calibre1">No, the realpolitik of unauthorized use is that users are not required to secure permission for uses that the rights holder will never discover. If you put some magazine clippings in your mood book, the magazine publisher will never find out you did so. If you stick a Dilbert cartoon on your office-door, Scott Adams will never know about it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So while technically the law has allowed rights holders to infinitely discriminate among the offerings they want to make — Special discounts on this book, which may only be read on Wednesdays! This film half-price, if you agree only to show it to people whose names start with D! — practicality has dictated that licenses could only be offered on enforceable terms.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When it comes to retail customers for information goods — readers, listeners, watchers — this whole license abstraction falls flat. No one wants to believe that the book he’s brought home is only partly his, and subject to the terms of a license set out on the flyleaf. You’d be a flaming jackass if you showed up at a con and insisted that your book may not be read aloud, nor photocopied in part and marked up for a writers’ workshop, nor made the subject of a piece of fanfiction.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the office, you might get a sweet deal on a coffee machine on the promise that you’ll use a certain brand of coffee, and even sign off on a deal to let the coffee company check in on this from time to time. But no one does this at home. We instinctively and rightly recoil from the idea that our personal, private dealings in our homes should be subject to oversight from some company from whom we’ve bought something. We bought it. It’s ours. Even when we rent things, like cars, we recoil from the idea that Hertz might track our movements, or stick a camera in the steering wheel.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Internet and the PC made it possible to sell a lot of purely digital “goods” — software, music, movies and books delivered as pure digits over the wire, without a physical good changing hands, the copyright lawyers groped about for a way to take account of this. It’s in the nature of a computer that it copies what you put on it. A computer is said to be working, and of high quality, in direct proportion to the degree to which it swiftly and accurately copies the information that it is presented with.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The copyright lawyers had a versatile hammer in their toolbox: the copyright license. These licenses had been presented to corporations for years. Frustratingly (for the lawyers), these corporate customers had their own counsel, and real bargaining power, which made it impossible to impose really interesting conditions on them, like limiting the use of a movie such that it couldn’t be fast-forwarded, or preventing the company from letting more than one employee review a journal at a time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Regular customers didn’t have lawyers or negotiating leverage. They were a natural for licensing regimes. Have a look at the next click-through “agreement” you’re provided with on purchasing a piece of software or an electronic book or song. The terms set out in those agreements are positively Dickensian in their marvelous idiocy. Sony BMG recently shipped over eight million music CDs with an “agreement” that bound its purchasers to destroy their music if they left the country or had a house-fire, and to promise not to listen to their tunes while at work.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But customers understand property — you bought it, you own it — and they don’t understand copyright. Practically no one understands copyright. I know editors at multibillion-dollar publishing houses who don’t know the difference between copyright and trademark (if you’ve ever heard someone say, “You need to defend a copyright or you lose it,” you’ve found one of these people who confuse copyright and trademark; what’s more, this statement isn’t particularly true of trademark, either). I once got into an argument with a senior Disney TV exec who truly believed that if you re-broadcasted an old program, it was automatically re-copyrighted and got another 95 years of exclusive use (that’s wrong).</p>
<p class="calibre1">So this is where copyright breaks: When copyright lawyers try to treat readers and listeners and viewers as if they were (weak and unlucky) corporations who could be strong-armed into license agreements you wouldn’t wish on a dog. There’s no conceivable world in which people are going to tiptoe around the property they’ve bought and paid for, re-checking their licenses to make sure that they’re abiding by the terms of an agreement they doubtless never read. Why read something if it’s non-negotiable, anyway?</p>
<p class="calibre1">The answer is simple: treat your readers’ property as property. What readers do with their own equipment, as private, noncommercial actors, is not a fit subject for copyright regulation or oversight. The Securities Exchange Commission doesn’t impose rules on you when you loan a friend five bucks for lunch. Anti-gambling laws aren’t triggered when you bet your kids an ice-cream cone that you’ll bicycle home before them. Copyright shouldn’t come between an end-user of a creative work and her property.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, this approach is made even simpler by the fact that practically every customer for copyrighted works already operates on this assumption. Which is not to say that this might make some business-models more difficult to pursue. Obviously, if there was some way to ensure that a given publisher was the only source for a copyrighted work, that publisher could hike up its prices, devote less money to service, and still sell its wares. Having to compete with free copies handed from user to user makes life harder — hasn’t it always?</p>
<p class="calibre1">But it is most assuredly possible. Look at Apple’s wildly popular iTunes Music Store, which has sold over one billion tracks since 2003. Every song on iTunes is available as a free download from user-to-user, peer-to-peer networks like Kazaa. Indeed, the P2P monitoring company Big Champagne reports that the average time-lapse between a iTunes-exclusive song being offered by Apple and that same song being offered on P2P networks is 180 seconds.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Every iTunes customer could readily acquire every iTunes song for free, using the fastest-adopted technology in history. Many of them do (just as many fans photocopy their favorite stories from magazines and pass them around to friends). But Apple has figured out how to compete well enough by offering a better service and a better experience to realize a good business out of this. (Apple also imposes ridiculous licensing restrictions, but that’s a subject for a future column).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Science fiction is a genre of clear-eyed speculation about the future. It should have no place for wishful thinking about a world where readers willingly put up with the indignity of being treated as “licensees” instead of customers.</p>

<p class="calibre1">In Praise of Fanfic</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Originally published in Locus Magazine, May 2007)</p>
<p class="calibre1">I wrote my first story when I was six. It was 1977, and I had just had my mind blown clean out of my skull by a new movie called Star Wars (the golden age of science fiction is 12; the golden age of cinematic science fiction is six). I rushed home and stapled a bunch of paper together, trimmed the sides down so that it approximated the size and shape of a mass-market paperback, and set to work. I wrote an elaborate, incoherent ramble about Star Wars, in which the events of the film replayed themselves, tweaked to suit my tastes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I wrote a lot of Star Wars fanfic that year. By the age of 12, I’d graduated to Conan. By the age of 18, it was Harlan Ellison. By the age of 26, it was Bradbury, by way of Gibson. Today, I hope I write more or less like myself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Walk the streets of Florence and you’ll find a copy of the David on practically every corner. For centuries, the way to become a Florentine sculptor has been to copy Michelangelo, to learn from the master. Not just the great Florentine sculptors, either — great or terrible, they all start with the master; it can be the start of a lifelong passion, or a mere fling. The copy can be art, or it can be crap — the best way to find out which kind you’ve got inside you is to try.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Science fiction has the incredible good fortune to have attracted huge, social groups of fanfiction writers. Many pros got their start with fanfic (and many of them still work at it in secret), and many fanfic writers are happy to scratch their itch by working only with others’ universes, for the sheer joy of it. Some fanfic is great — there’s plenty of Buffy fanfic that trumps the official, licensed tie-in novels — and some is purely dreadful.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Two things are sure about all fanfic, though: first, that people who write and read fanfic are already avid readers of writers whose work they’re paying homage to; and second, that the people who write and read fanfic derive fantastic satisfaction from their labors. This is great news for writers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Great because fans who are so bought into your fiction that they’ll make it their own are fans forever, fans who’ll evangelize your work to their friends, fans who’ll seek out your work however you publish it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Great because fans who use your work therapeutically, to work out their own creative urges, are fans who have a damned good reason to stick with the field, to keep on reading even as our numbers dwindle. Even when the fandom revolves around movies or TV shows, fanfic is itself a literary pursuit, something undertaken in the world of words. The fanfic habit is a literary habit.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In Japan, comic book fanfic writers publish fanfic manga called dojinshi — some of these titles dwarf the circulation of the work they pay tribute to, and many of them are sold commercially. Japanese comic publishers know a good thing when they see it, and these fanficcers get left alone by the commercial giants they attach themselves to.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And yet for all this, there are many writers who hate fanfic. Some argue that fans have no business appropriating their characters and situations, that it’s disrespectful to imagine your precious fictional people into sexual scenarios, or to retell their stories from a different point of view, or to snatch a victorious happy ending from the tragic defeat the writer ended her book with.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Other writers insist that fans who take without asking — or against the writer’s wishes — are part of an “entitlement culture” that has decided that it has the moral right to lift scenarios and characters without permission, that this is part of our larger postmodern moral crisis that is making the world a worse place.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some writers dismiss all fanfic as bad art and therefore unworthy of appropriation. Some call it copyright infringement or trademark infringement, and every now and again, some loony will actually threaten to sue his readers for having had the gall to tell his stories to each other.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m frankly flabbergasted by these attitudes. Culture is a lot older than art — that is, we have had social storytelling for a lot longer than we’ve had a notional class of artistes whose creativity is privileged and elevated to the numinous, far above the everyday creativity of a kid who knows that she can paint and draw, tell a story and sing a song, sculpt and invent a game.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To call this a moral failing — and a new moral failing at that! — is to turn your back on millions of years of human history. It’s no failing that we internalize the stories we love, that we rework them to suit our minds better. The Pygmalion story didn’t start with Shaw or the Greeks, nor did it end with My Fair Lady. Pygmalion is at least thousands of years old — think of Moses passing for the Pharaoh’s son! — and has been reworked in a billion bedtime stories, novels, D&amp;D games, movies, fanfic stories, songs, and legends.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Each person who retold Pygmalion did something both original — no two tellings are just alike — and derivative, for there are no new ideas under the sun. Ideas are easy. Execution is hard. That’s why writers don’t really get excited when they’re approached by people with great ideas for novels. We’ve all got more ideas than we can use — what we lack is the cohesive whole.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Much fanfic — the stuff written for personal consumption or for a small social group — isn’t bad art. It’s just not art. It’s not written to make a contribution to the aesthetic development of humanity. It’s created to satisfy the deeply human need to play with the stories that constitute our world. There’s nothing trivial about telling stories with your friends — even if the stories themselves are trivial. The act of telling stories to one another is practically sacred — and it’s unquestionably profound. What’s more, lots of retellings are art: witness Pat Murphy’s wonderful There and Back Again (Tolkien) and Geoff Ryman’s brilliant World Fantasy Award-winning Was (L. Frank Baum).</p>
<p class="calibre1">The question of respect is, perhaps, a little thornier. The dominant mode of criticism in fanfic circles is to compare a work to the canon — “Would Spock ever say that, in ‘real’ life?” What’s more, fanfic writers will sometimes apply this test to works that are of the canon, as in “Spock never would have said that, and Gene Roddenberry has no business telling me otherwise.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is a curious mix of respect and disrespect. Respect because it’s hard to imagine a more respectful stance than the one that says that your work is the yardstick against which all other work is to be measured — what could be more respectful than having your work made into the gold standard? On the other hand, this business of telling writers that they’ve given their characters the wrong words and deeds can feel obnoxious or insulting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Writers sometimes speak of their characters running away from them, taking on a life of their own. They say that these characters — drawn from real people in our lives and mixed up with our own imagination — are autonomous pieces of themselves. It’s a short leap from there to mystical nonsense about protecting our notional, fictional children from grubby fans who’d set them to screwing each other or bowing and scraping before some thinly veiled version of the fanfic writer herself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s something to the idea of the autonomous character. Big chunks of our wetware are devoted to simulating other people, trying to figure out if we are likely to fight or fondle them. It’s unsurprising that when you ask your brain to model some other person, it rises to the task. But that’s exactly what happens to a reader when you hand your book over to him: he simulates your characters in his head, trying to interpret that character’s actions through his own lens.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Writers can’t ask readers not to interpret their work. You can’t enjoy a novel that you haven’t interpreted — unless you model the author’s characters in your head, you can’t care about what they do and why they do it. And once readers model a character, it’s only natural that readers will take pleasure in imagining what that character might do offstage, to noodle around with it. This isn’t disrespect: it’s active reading.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Our field is incredibly privileged to have such an active fanfic writing practice. Let’s stop treating them like thieves and start treating them like honored guests at a table that we laid just for them.</p>
