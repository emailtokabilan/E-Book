<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">KIDNAPER’S	ISLAND</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	 Rodgers	 rolled	 half	 over,	 squirmed	 about,	 then	 sat	 up.	 For	 a	 long	 time	 he had	 felt	 the	 floor	 beneath	 him	 vibrate	 with	 the	 throb	 of	 powerful	 motors.	 His eardrums,	beaten	upon	as	they	had	been	by	the	roar	of	those	motors,	now	seemed incapable	of	registering	sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	 the	 slightest	 murmur	 suggesting	 life	 reached	 his	 ears.	 “Not	 the	 rustle	 of	 a leaf,	nor	the	lap	of	a	tiny	wave;	not	the	whisper	of	a	village	child	asleep,”	he	told himself.	“Can	I	have	gone	stone	deaf?”	Cold	perspiration	started	out	upon	the	tip of	his	nose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then,	 piercing	 the	 silence	 like	 a	 siren’s	 scream	 in	 the	 night,	 came	 a	 wild, weird,	mad,	hilarious	laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Startled	by	this	sudden	shock	of	sound,	he	shuddered	from	head	to	foot.	Then,	at once,	he	felt	better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At	least	I	am	not	deaf.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 laugh,”	 he	 mused	 a	 moment	 later,	 “it	 was	 almost	 human,	 but	 not	 quite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	could	it	have	been?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	 this	 question	 he	 could	 form	 no	 answer.	 The	 wild	 places,	 wilderness,	 forest, lakes,	 rivers,	 were	 sealed	 books	 to	 Red.	 He	 had	 lived	 his	 life	 in	 a	 city,	 lived strenuously	and	with	a	purpose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some	wild	thing,”	he	murmured.	“But	where	am	I?”	His	brow	wrinkled.	“I’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 kidnaped,	 dragged	 from	 my	 berth	 in	 a	 sleeping	 car,	 thrown	 into	 a	 speed boat,	 carried	 miles	 down	 a	 river,	 bundled	 into	 this	 airplane,	 whirled	 for	 hours through	the	air,	and	landed	here.	But	where	is	here?	And	why	am	I	here	at	all?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>“Hours,”	he	whispered	slowly.	A	stray	moonbeam	lighted	a	spot	on	his	knee.	He placed	his	wrist	there	and	read	the	dial	of	his	watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	hours.	It’s	five	after	midnight.	And	to-morrow,	hundreds	of	miles	away,	I was	to	have	made	at	least	two	touchdowns.	The	crowd	would	expect	at	least	one sixty-yard	dash	by	the	Red	Rover.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 Red	 Rover.”	 That	 was	 the	 name	 the	 fans	 had	 given	 him.	 Well,	 the	 Red Rover	would	not	run.	He	smiled	grimly.	But,	after	all,	what	did	it	matter?	They were	to	play	Woodville.	What	was	Woodville?	A	weak	team.	Old	Midway’s	cubs</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	beat	them.	It	was	a	midweek	game,	mainly	for	practice.	He	wasn’t	needed for	that.	But	Saturday’s	game!	Ah,	well,	that	was	another	story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 kidnaped!”	 He	 brought	 himself	 up	 with	 a	 start.	 “I’ve	 been	 kidnaped! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragged	from	my	berth.	Whirled	all	the	way	to	some	place	where	wild	creatures laugh	at	midnight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kidnaped.	 The	 whole	 affair	 seemed	 absurd	 to	 him.	 He	 had	 read	 of	 kidnapings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 had	 been	 many	 of	 late.	 It	 had	 always	 made	 his	 blood	 boil	 when	 some innocent	child,	some	helpless	woman	had	been	carried	away	to	a	dismal	hole	and held	for	ransom.	“Low-lived	curs,”	he	had	called	the	kidnapers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ransom!”	He	laughed	a	low	laugh.	He	was	a	college	student,	a	football	player for	two	months	of	the	year,	a	night	clerk	in	a	hotel	the	rest	of	the	year,	an	orphan boy	working	his	way	through	the	university.	He	thought	there	were	three	dollars in	his	pocket,	but	he	could	not	be	sure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kidnaped!	Must	have	got	the	wrong	fellow	this	time.	Tell	’em	who	I	am,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">they’ll	turn	me	loose;	hustle	me	back,	like	as	not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	wrong.	They	would	neither	turn	him	loose	nor	hustle	him	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	Red.	You	can	get	out.”	These	words	were	spoken	as	the	airplane	door swung	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Red!”	the	boy	thought	with	a	start.	“So	they	 <i class="calibre3">do</i>	know	who	I	am.	They	did	mean to	get	me.	I	wonder	why! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whew!”	he	whistled	as	a	cold	breeze	struck	his	cheek.	“Cold	up	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>“Cold	 enough,”	 the	 other	 grumbled.	 “Come	 on,	 shake	 a	 leg!	 This	 boat	 swings about.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Boat.”	 It’s	 strange	 how	 a	 single	 word	 tells	 a	 long	 story.	 The	 whiff	 of	 cold	 air had	 told	 him	 that	 they	 had	 flown	 north.	 Now	 he	 knew	 that	 they	 had	 landed	 on water.	But	what	water?	And	where? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	you	are.”	A	hand	in	the	moonlight	guided	him	to	a	seat	in	the	stern	of	a small	boat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	 opened	 his	 eyes	 wide	 at	 the	 scene	 that	 lay	 before	 him,	 a	 broad,	 deep	 bay fringed	by	a	black	ribbon	of	spruce	and	balsam.	The	moonlight,	forming	a	path of	 gold	 across	 the	 water,	 fell	 upon	 some	 dark	 object.	 As	 the	 oars	 of	 the	 boat creaked,	the	dark	object	made	a	splashing	sound;	it	moved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	if	reading	the	boy’s	thoughts,	the	oarsman	ceased	his	labors	to	cast	the	circle of	a	powerful	flashlight	in	the	direction	of	the	moving	creature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	a	quick	intake	of	breath	Red	stared	enchanted;	for	there,	not	twenty	yards away,	 standing	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 small	 island	 which	 he	 had	 reached	 at	 this moment,	was	a	moose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nowhere	in	all	his	life	had	the	boy	beheld	such	complete	majesty.	Erect,	silent, powerful,	the	monarch	of	the	forest	stood	there	defiant	and	unafraid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	 in	 all	 the	 earth	 could	 one	 find	 a	 spot	 such	 as	 this?”	 Red	 breathed	 to himself.	“A	spot	so	sheltered	that	even	the	shyest	of	the	forest’s	great	ones	shows no	fear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	expected	the	oarsman	to	drag	a	rifle	from	the	prow	and	fire	point-blank at	this	moose.	Instead,	he	sat	there	for	a	second,	his	rough	face	disfigured	by	a semblance	 of	 a	 smile;	 then,	 pocketing	 his	 flashlight,	 he	 once	 again	 took	 up	 his oars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	Red	there	was	little	enough	time	for	thought.	The	boat	swung	about.	Before them	lay	a	point	of	land,	perhaps	the	end	of	an	island.	At	its	extreme	end	was	a little	 half-clearing	 where	 a	 score	 of	 girdled	 birches	 pointed	 their	 barren	 trunks, like	dead	fingers,	toward	the	sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 the	 edge	 of	 this	 clearing	 was	 a	 small	 log	 cabin.	 From	 this	 a	 pale	 light</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>gleamed.	Toward	this	cabin	the	boat	directed	its	course. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘This	 is	 the	 forest	 primeval.’”	 The	 words	 sprang	 unbidden	 to	 the	 boy’s	 lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘The	murmuring	pines	and	the	hemlocks,	bearded	with	moss,	and	in	garments</p>
<p class="calibre1">green,	 indistinct	 in	 the	 twilight,	 stand	 like	 Druids	 of	 eld,	 with	 voices	 sad	 and prophetic,	stand	like	harpers	hoar,	with	beards	that	rest	on	their	bosoms.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	to-morrow	was	to	have	been—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	closed	his	eyes	he	saw	what	it	was	to	have	been:	a	wild,	shouting	throng; college	 songs,	 college	 yells,	 bands,	 waving	 banners.	 “Go,	 Midway!	 Go!”	 Two squads	 battling	 for	 victory.	 Wild	 scrambles.	 Futile	 dashes.	 And,	 with	 good fortune,	a	mad	dash	of	fifty	yards	to	triumphal	victory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Life,”	he	whispered,	“is	strange.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	boat	bumped.	A	narrow	landing	lay	beside	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 get	 off	 here.”	 There	 was	 something	 impersonal	 in	 the	 tone	 of	 this	 strange pilot	 of	 the	 night.	 “This’ll	 be	 home	 for	 you,	 son,	 for	 quite	 some	 considerable time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hope	you’re	wrong,”	Red	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	room	he	entered	a	moment	later	was	small	and	very	narrow.	In	one	corner</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	a	cot,	in	another	a	table	and	chair.	Across	from	the	table	was	a	curious	affair of	sheet	iron	that,	he	guessed,	might	be	a	stove.	The	place	was	agreeably	warm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	must	be	a	small	fire.	On	the	table	a	candle	burned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning	about	to	seek	for	an	explanation	of	all	that	had	been	happening	and	of his	 strange	 surroundings,	 he	 was	 not	 a	 little	 startled	 to	 find	 himself	 alone.	 The door	 had	 been	 silently	 closed	 behind	 him.	 And	 locked?	 Well,	 perhaps.	 What could	it	matter?	He	was,	beyond	doubt,	surrounded	by	water,	the	merciless	water of	 the	 north	 country—some	 north	 country	 in	 November;	 surrounded,	 too,	 by determined	men,	hostile	men,	perhaps,	who	had	apparently	ordained	that	his	stay in	the	cabin	should	be	a	long	one.	Once	again,	as	he	dropped	into	the	chair,	there came	to	his	mind	that	forceful	interrogation:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>As	before,	he	could	form	no	adequate	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 mind	 was	 busy	 with	 this	 problem	 when,	 with	 startling	 suddenness,	 his attention	was	caught	and	held	by	the	low	sound	of	voices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have	 you	 signed?”	 It	 was	 a	 man	 who	 spoke.	 The	 voice	 was	 not	 gruff;	 a	 low, smooth,	persuasive	voice,	too	smooth,	too	persuasive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quite	 in	 contrast	 was	 the	 answer.	 Unmistakably	 feminine,	 it	 came	 sharp	 and crisp	as	the	crash	of	icicles	fallen	from	the	eaves.	“I	will	never	sign.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	consider.”	The	 man’s	voice	was	 not	raised,	still	 smooth,	persuasive.	“You are	on	an	island.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An	island.	I	thought	so,”	Red	whispered	to	himself.	“But	who	can	this	girl	be?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	the	one	beyond	the	partition	was	a	girl	he	did	not	doubt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 will	 never	 sign!”	 the	 girl	 broke	 in	 upon	 the	 other’s	 oily	 speech.	 “My	 father owes	you	nothing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Consider,”	 the	 other	 persisted.	 “You	 are	 on	 a	 narrow	 island	 within	 a	 bay.	 The water	 of	 the	 bay	 is	 icy	 cold.	 You	 might	 swim	 it	 in	 safety,	 though	 I	 doubt	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Should	you	succeed,	it	would	be	but	to	find	yourself	upon	a	much	larger	island. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 island	 is	 fifteen	 miles	 from	 the	 nearest	 mainland,	 a	 hundred	 from	 the farthest.	 Can	 you	 swim	 that,	 or	 row	 it	 even	 if	 you	 should	 find	 a	 boat?	 Ah,	 no. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	waters	of	this	great	lake	are	terrible	in	their	fury.	And	Superior	never	gives up	her	dead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	something	so	sepulchral	about	these	last	words	that	the	listening	boy shuddered	in	spite	of	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On	such	an	island	there	are	people.”	The	girl’s	tone	was	stubborn,	defiant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	is	no	one.”	The	tone	of	the	speaker	carried	conviction.	“In	summer,	yes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	winter,	no.	We	are	here	alone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then,”	said	the	girl,	“I	shall	stay	here	until	summer	comes.	Winter	will	soon	be here.	And	‘if	winter	comes,’”	she	quoted,	“‘can	spring	be	far	behind?’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very	far.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>There	was	a	quiet	cadence	in	the	speaker’s	tone	that	sent	chills	coursing	up	Red Rodger’s	 spine.	 At	 the	 same	 time	 he	 hardly	 suppressed	 a	 desire	 to	 shout:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bravo!”	to	the	girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	closing	of	a	door	some	seconds	later	told	him	that	this	was	a	cabin	of	at	least two	rooms	and,	strangely	enough,	between	these	rooms	was	no	connecting	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a><b class="calibre4">CHAPTER	II</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">WHISPERS	IN	THE	NIGHT</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Red	Rodgers	stretched	his	feet	out	before	the	tiny	stove	in	his	narrow	room, his	brow	wrinkled.	Here	was	a	situation	for	you!	A	football	game	to	be	played to-morrow	four	or	five	hundred	miles	away.	He	laughed	a	silent,	mirthless	laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Football,”	 he	 whispered.	 He	 was	 surprised	 to	 find	 within	 his	 being	 a	 certain feeling	of	relief.	He	relaxed	to	the	very	tips	of	his	toes.	“Football.”	He	had	seen	a lot	of	it.	Too	much.	This	was	his	first	year	on	the	varsity.	Almost	without	willing it,	or	even	realizing	it,	he	had	become	the	central	attraction	of	his	team.	He	was the	hub	about	which	the	offense	circled.	His	had	been	the	power	and	the	glory, the	power	to	dash	and	beat,	weave	and	wind	his	way	to	many	a	touchdown,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">glory	of	the	victor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	power	and	the	glory.”	Little	enough	Red	cared	for	glory.	But	power?	Ah, yes!	All	his	life	he	had	striven	for	power,	physical	power	for	the	most	part.	But he	meant	in	the	end	to	go	forward,	to	succeed	in	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Born	and	raised	in	a	city	of	mills,	he	had,	from	the	age	of	fourteen,	played	his little	part	in	the	making	of	steel.	For	three	summers	and	at	every	other	available hour	he	had	toiled	at	steel.	Bare	to	the	waist,	brown,	heat-burned,	perspiring,	he had	 dragged	 at	 long	 bars,	 raking	 away	 at	 steel	 bars,	 but	 recently	 formed	 by rushing,	 crashing	 rollers,	 that	 were	 still	 smoking	 hot.	 Other	 hours	 he	 had	 spent on	the	gridiron.	The	one	helped	the	other.	Struggling	with	steel,	he	had	become like	 steel	 himself,	 hard,	 elastic,	 resisting.	 As	 he	 went	 down	 the	 field	 men	 were repelled	from	his	Robot-like	body	as	they	might	had	he	been	a	thing	of	white-hot metal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then	 had	 come	 his	 great	 opportunity.	 A	 quiet,	 solidly	 built	 man,	 with wrinkled	face,	bright	eyes	and	tangled	hair,	had	watched	his	high	school	football exploits	 from	 the	 sidelines.	 From	 time	 to	 time	 he	 had	 beckoned	 and	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>whispered:	“Hold	the	ball	closer	to	your	body.	Lean.	Lean	far	over.	Don’t	run	for the	sidelines.	Break	your	way	through.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	had	been	an	air	of	authority	and	knowledge	not	to	be	questioned	about	this old	man.	Red	had	listened	and	had	tried	to	follow	the	other’s	teaching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	 one	 day	 during	 his	 senior	 year	 at	 Central	 High	 the	 old	 man	 had	 touched him	on	the	arm	and	had	pronounced	magical	words:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	university	will	need	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	had	thrilled	at	these	words.	He	knew	now,	on	the	instant,	that	this	was	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Grand	Old	Man”	of	football,	the	fairest,	squarest	coach	that	ever	lived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 had	 been	 good	 to	 know	 that	 the	 university	 would	 need	 him,	 for	 long	 ago	 he had	 learned	 that	 in	 his	 upward	 climb	 he	 would	 need	 the	 university.	 The university	 had	 found	 him.	 He	 had	 found	 the	 university.	 In	 his	 freshman	 year,	 a cub,	there	had	been	bitter	days	and	hours	of	triumph.	But	why	think	of	all	that? </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	a	restless	motion	he	rose,	took	three	steps,	the	extent	of	his	cabin,	retraced them	and	sat	down.	“Like	a	beast	in	a	cage!”	he	muttered	low.	“I’ll	not	stand	it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 thought	 soberly:	 “No,	 this	 is	 not	 to	 be	 endured.	 Better	 the	 hard	 grind	 of football.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	this	girl	in	that	other	log-walled	prison	cell?	His	mind	did	a	sudden	flip-flop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	rich,”	he	mused.	“At	least	her	father	is.	That	crook	said	he	was.	She	did not	deny	it.”	Red	did	not	approve	of	rich	people.	They	had	too	much,	others	too little.	He	thought	still	less	of	their	children.	It	mattered	little	to	him	that	the	sons and	 daughters	 of	 certain	 rich	 men	 had	 endeavored	 to	 make	 friends	 with	 him since	his	success	at	football.	He	could	not	understand	them,	was	puzzled	by	their ways,	and	wished	quite	sincerely	that	they	would	leave	him	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Soft,”	he	had	said	to	his	roommate,	“that’s	what	they	are.	No	experiences	worth having.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 this	 girl	 over	 there	 beyond	 the	 log	 wall,”	 he	 said	 to	 himself	 now,	 “she’s different.	Got	spunk.	Stands	up	and	defies	them,	she	does,	when	she	knows	they are	beasts,	as	all	kidnapers	are.	Tells	’em	she’ll	freeze	here	all	winter	rather	than</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>do	the	thing	they	want	her	to	do.	Nerve,	that’s	what!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	conscious	of	an	invisible	bond	that	bound	his	life	to	that	of	the	girl.	“In the	end	we	may	fight	it	out	together.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 hour	 was	 late.	 Once	 again	 the	 drowsy	 warmth	 of	 this	 narrow	 cell	 settled down	upon	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Football,”	he	mused.	“A	tough	business.	Thousands	screaming	their	lungs	out, ten,	twenty,	thirty,	forty	thousand	people	losing	their	heads	while	you	must	keep yours.	Wish	this	were	the	end,	wish	it	were	all	over.	Wish—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	again,	in	the	twinkling	of	an	eye,	his	mood	changed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	all	that,”	he	muttered	beneath	his	breath,	“I’ve	got	to	get	away!”	Leaping	to his	feet,	he	stood	there,	hard,	straight,	square,	with	purpose	written	in	every	line of	 his	 well	 formed	 body.	 “To-morrow’s	 game,	 that	 is	 nothing.	 But	 Saturday’s game,	that	is	everything.	It	is	the	end.	Final,	that’s	what	it	is.	Defeat	or	victory, that’s	 what	 it	 means.	 The	 championship	 or	 nothing.	 And	 Prang,	 the	 Grand	 Old Man,	says	it	depends	on	us! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 means	 me!”	 There	 came	 a	 stoop	 to	 his	 shoulders	 as	 if	 a	 load	 had	 fallen upon	them.	“For	the	Grand	Old	Man,	for	the	school	that	gave	me	a	chance,	for my	mother,	for	clean	sport	all	over	the	world,	I	must	escape.	I	must	play.	I	must win.	I	must!	Must!  <i class="calibre3">Must! </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet,	 even	 as	 these	 words	 formed	 themselves	 into	 thought	 he	 seemed	 to	 hear others.	 “On	 a	 narrow	 island	 within	 a	 bay.	 Icy	 water.	 Another	 larger	 island. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fifteen,	 seventy-five,	 a	 hundred	 miles	 from	 shore.	 Superior	 never	 gives	 up	 her dead.”	 Of	 a	 sudden	 the	 boy	 cursed	 the	 school	 days	 when	 he	 had	 neglected	 his study	 of	 geography.	 He	 saw	 it	 all	 now.	 Geography	 was	 travel.	 And	 how	 could one	find	travel	dull? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 travel!”	 Again	 that	 silent,	 mirthless	 laugh.	 “Who	 expects	 to	 travel	 as	 I have?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	thoughts	were	not	finished.	From	somewhere	had	come	a	long,	low,	hissing sound.	It	was	followed	by	a	whisper:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Over	here!	Come	close	to	the	wall.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>“Must	be	that	girl.”	His	heart	skipped	a	beat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	did	they	take	you	for?”	the	whisper	demanded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I—I	don’t	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fact.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	that	a	great	silence	settled	over	the	place.	This	Red	could	not	understand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why	had	she	started	the	conversation	if	she	did	not	expect	to	finish	it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 well,”	 he	 told	 himself	 at	 last,	 “girls	 are	 queer	 anyway.”	 He	 settled	 back comfortably	in	his	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Truth	was,	the	girl	suspected	him	of	being	a	decoy	placed	there	by	the	kidnapers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	end	she	came	to	see	that	she	had	little	to	lose	if	she	confided	in	a	decoy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again	came	her	long-drawn	signal,	demanding	attention.	And	after	that:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	you	want	to	escape?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never	 wanted	 anything	 half	 so	 much	 in	 my	 life!”	 Then	 in	 a	 sudden	 burst	 of confidence	 he	 told	 her	 of	 the	 game	 that	 was	 to	 be	 on	 Saturday,	 of	 the	 veteran coach’s	 fatherly	 interest	 in	 his	 career,	 of	 his	 hopes,	 his	 fears,	 his	 secret ambitions.	All	this	he	poured	into	a	not	unwilling	ear.	Only	he	did	not	tell	her	he was	the	far-famed	“Red	Rover.”	This	he	reserved	for	the	future. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good!”	the	girl	exclaimed,	still	in	a	whisper.	“Then	our	purposes	are	one.	We must	join	hands.	Put	her	there!	Shake	on	it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This,	 considering	 that	 a	 log	 wall	 eight	 inches	 thick	 lay	 between	 them,	 was	 of course	impossible.	But	they	pledged	themselves	in	pantomime. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a><b class="calibre4">CHAPTER	III</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">“WE	MUST	ESCAPE” </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	must	find	some	way	of	escape.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girl’s	tone,	low,	mellow,	earnest,	was	scarcely	more	than	a	whisper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	we	are	upon	an	island	within	an	island.	Or	did	that	man	lie	to	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	did	not	lie.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	can	do	but	one	thing	at	a	time.	We	must	escape.	And	after	that—”	She	did not	finish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	boy	found	it	difficult,	this	discussing	plans	with	one	he	could	not	see,	had never	seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	could	soon	cut	a	small	hole	between	two	logs,”	he	told	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	thought	of	suggesting	this,	but	considered	it	better	to	wait. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	set	about	planning	their	escape	methodically.	The	staple	that	held	the	padlock to	his	door	was	large.	It	was	clinched	on	the	inside.	By	working	first	with	a	nail pulled	out	of	the	wall,	then	a	bit	of	wire,	he	managed	to	straighten	these	points. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	 little	 by	 little,	 without	 sound,	 he	 pushed	 the	 staple	 back	 until	 only	 the points	showed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Two	or	three	good	yanks	and	the	door	will	fly	open,”	he	confided	to	the	girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	mine?	How	are	we	to	manage	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>Red	 pondered	 this	 problem.	 He	 could,	 he	 told	 himself,	 pass	 his	 crude instruments	through	to	her.	But	were	her	fingers	strong	enough	for	the	task?	He doubted	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	studied	the	wall	that	lay	between	them.	He	was	at	a	loss	to	account	for	this wall,	 which	 had,	 from	 all	 appearances,	 stood	 there	 for	 some	 years.	 Then	 it occurred	 to	 him	 that	 a	 trapper	 had	 built	 the	 cabin,	 using	 one	 room	 for	 himself, the	other	for	his	dogs.	Campers	of	a	later	date	had	doubtless	cleared	up	the	dogs’</p>
<p class="calibre1">kennel	and	made	a	bunk	room	of	it	without	removing	the	partition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	this	partition,”	he	whispered	excitedly,	“is	not	notched	into	the	cabin	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	logs	were	merely	laid	up,	one	upon	another,	then	a	white	birch	pole	spiked in	each	corner	to	hold	them	into	position.	Once	the	poles	are	removed,	the	logs may	be	taken	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	then?”	the	girl	breathed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	room	will	be	mine	and	mine	yours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Until	they	discover.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	will	not	discover.	We	will	not	remove	the	logs	until	the	hour	set	for	our escape.	When	they	discover	the	cage	door	open,	the	birds	will	have	flown.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 with	 strangely	 mixed	 feelings	 that	 Red	 began	 the	 task	 of	 removing	 the white	 birch	 poles	 which	 held	 the	 logs	 in	 place.	 Until	 that	 moment	 the	 girl	 had seemed	quite	remote,	one	living	in	another	world,	a	rich	man’s	daughter.	But	as the	 last	 spike	 yielded	 and	 the	 last	 pole	 stood	 leaning	 lightly	 in	 its	 place,	 as	 he realized	that	the	logs	that	lay	between	them	could	be	removed	as	easily	as	stones are	 piled	 or	 grain	 shocked,	 he	 became	 conscious	 of	 a	 new	 sort	 of	 comradeship such	as	he	had	experienced	with	none	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	are	in	for	it,”	he	breathed,	“for	better	or	for	worse.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	better	or	for	worse,”	came	the	girl’s	faint	answer.	“And,	oh,	I’m	sure	it	is for	better	than	we	dare	dream.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only	one	thing	could	be	truly	good:	to	get	back	to	Soldiers’	Field	on	time.”	Red thought	this,	but	he	did	not	say	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>With	 the	 preparations	 all	 made	 there	 remained	 but	 to	 wait.	 To	 one	 of	 Red’s nature,	this	was	hardest	of	all.	He	was	ever	for	action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	we	must	wait,”	he	said	to	the	log	wall	before	him,	in	tones	loud	enough	for the	 girl’s	 ears.	 “The	 guard	 will	 be	 on	 the	 alert	 early	 in	 the	 night.	 Later	 he	 will relax	his	vigil.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	yes.	We	must	wait!”	came	from	the	other	side	of	the	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 putting	 out	 my	 light,	 retiring	 for	 the	 night.”	 These	 words,	 ending	 in	 a subdued	laugh,	came	from	behind	the	wall	half	an	hour	later,	telling	Red	that	for the	eyes	of	the	guard	she	had	retired	for	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Retired	for	the	night,”	Red	thought	soberly.	“Wonder	when	we	will	retire,	and where?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	thought	of	the	cold	black	waters	of	this	inland	bay,	a	mental	picture	of	his own	 form,	 lying	 ten	 fathoms	 deep	 where	 the	 fishes	 play,	 came	 to	 him.	 He	 saw his	 hands	 waved	 about	 by	 the	 currents.	 Then	 with	 a	 shudder	 he	 shook	 himself free	from	the	illusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fifteen	 minutes	 later	 he	 too	 “retired	 for	 the	 night.”	 After	 that,	 with	 the	 cabin shrouded	in	darkness,	he	sat	and	listened	to	the	sounds	of	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Curious	sounds	they	were	to	one	who	knew	nothing	of	wild	life;	the	shrill,	long-drawn	whistle	of	some	bird	calling	to	his	mate;	the	throaty	call	of	a	bull	moose from	down	the	bay,	and	that	piercing	scream	of	the	loon,	never	failing	to	set	his blood	running	cold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 thought	 he	 caught	 the	 sound	 of	 footsteps.	 The	 guard!	 What	 if	 he	 appeared and	discovered	all	that	had	been	done?	He	listened	long	for	a	rattle	at	the	lock, but	none	came. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 last,	 standing	 erect,	 he	 stretched	 himself	 like	 a	 cat,	 then	 said	 in	 a	 hoarse whisper:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	taking	down	the	wall.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	absolute	silence	he	lifted	the	birch	poles	from	their	places.	He	put	a	hand	to the	topmost	log.	It	did	not	yield	to	his	pull. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>“Spiked	on	the	other	side.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	tried	the	second	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	came	away.	Without	a	sound	he	placed	it	at	his	feet.	A	second,	a	third,	fourth, fifth.	Still	no	sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	 opening	 three	 feet	 wide	 now	 lay	 before	 him.	 He	 put	 out	 a	 hand.	 It	 touched some	one.	Groping	about,	he	found	the	girl’s	hand,	then	guided	her	through	the opening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 is	 strange,”	 he	 thought.	 “I	 have	 never	 seen	 this	 person.	 Is	 she	 dark	 or	 fair, beautiful	or	ugly?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	or	two	things	he	could	know.	She	was	short	and	rather	plump.	Her	muscles were	hard.	He	was	surprised	at	this.	He	had	supposed	that	rich	men’s	daughters were	always	soft	and	white. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	drew	the	girl	to	a	place	on	the	bench	beside	him.	She	was	trembling.	As	her shoulder	 pressed	 against	 his,	 he	 felt	 the	 wild	 beating	 of	 her	 heart.	 This	 would never	do.	She	must	be	calm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	for	his	own	feelings,	he	had	gone	cold	all	over,	just	as	he	had	at	the	beginning of	every	gridiron	battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Warm	enough	when	time	comes	for	action,”	he	told	himself.	It	had	always	been that	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	time	for	action	had	not	yet	come.	They	continued	to	listen	there	in	the	dark; a	 boy	 and	 a	 girl;	 the	 girl	 kidnaped	 for	 ransom	 which	 she	 refused	 to	 assist	 in collecting,	the	boy	carried	away	and	held	for	he	knew	not	what. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ticking	of	their	watches	sounded	loud	in	this	lonely	place.	Water	lapped	on the	shore.	From	time	to	time	there	came	a	low	bump-bump. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rowboat	tied	to	the	dock,”	Red	whispered	to	the	girl.	“Wonder	if	we	could	get it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>She	made	no	reply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	somewhere	back	in	the	forest	a	hoot	owl	began	his	silly	noise.	Red	did	not know	what	it	was.	He	asked	the	girl	about	it.	She	explained	briefly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hope	he	keeps	it	up,”	he	sighed.	“Cover	up	any	little	nasty	sounds	we	may	stir up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will	 there	 be	 noises?”	 The	 girl	 seemed	 to	 shrink.	 Then	 suddenly	 her	 form stiffened.	“Count	me	in	on—on	anything.	They	are	dirty	dogs,	these	kidnapers; deserve	the	worst!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	the	very	worst!”	Red	agreed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 felt	 loath	 to	 leave	 this	 place	 of	 warmth	 and	 momentary	 peace.	 There	 was something	 altogether	 agreeable	 about	 being	 so	 near	 to	 this	 girl	 he	 had	 never seen.	“Well,	the	zero	hour	approaches.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.”	She	sprang	to	her	feet.	“Let’s	make	it	now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	it	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 rose	 to	 stand	 beside	 her.	 So	 for	 one	 full	 moment,	 side	 by	 side	 in	 the	 dark, they	stood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	last,	with	a	long-drawn	sigh,	he	seized	her	hand	to	lead	her	out	into	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a><b class="calibre4">CHAPTER	IV</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">THE	GHOST	APPEARS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	mysterious	disappearance	of	Red	Rodgers,	or	the	Red	Rover,	as	every	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew	him,	caused	a	great	commotion.	Had	a	President	been	assassinated	it	could not	have	caused	a	greater	stir. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	an	hour	had	passed	after	he	vanished	before	the	newspapers	came	out	with an	extra	with	a	story	telling	in	detail	all	that	was	known	about	the	affair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Red	 Rover,”	 the	 story	 ran,	 “has	 never	 cared	 for	 crowds.	 Being	 the	 star	 of	 the team,	he	has	often	of	late	been	all	but	mobbed	by	impetuous	youths,	foolish	old women	and	infatuated	girls.	For	this	reason	he	had	formed	a	friendship	with	the watchman	at	the	tracks	by	the	river	where	the	trains	are	made	up.	To-night,	once safely	 past	 this	 watchman,	 he	 went	 directly	 to	 his	 berth	 and	 turned	 in	 for	 the night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	to	be	assumed	that	he	fell	asleep	at	once,	for,	though	the	watchman	was	not two	hundred	yards	away,	he	heard	no	outcry	such	as	might	be	expected	had	the boy	been	surprised	while	asleep	and	gagged	before	fully	awake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	 are	 few	 clues,”	 the	 story	 went	 on	 to	 state.	 “In	 their	 haste	 the	 kidnapers dragged	 a	 pillow	 from	 the	 berth.	 It	 was	 this	 pillow,	 standing	 out	 white	 in	 the moonlight,	 that	 attracted	 the	 watchman’s	 attention.	 The	 watchman	 distinctly recalls	hearing	the	sudden	whir	and	thunder	of	a	powerful	motor	shortly	before making	this	discovery.	He	believes	this	to	have	been	the	motor	of	a	speed	boat, and	has	the	impression	that	it	went	south. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Various	 motives	 have	 been	 brought	 forward.	 The	 Rover,	 some	 say,	 was kidnaped	for	ransom.	He	is	the	all-important	factor	in	the	game	to	be	played	at the	 end	 of	 the	 week.	 Without	 him	 Old	 Midway	 cannot	 hope	 to	 win.	 For	 this reason	 the	 kidnapers	 may	 have	 believed	 that	 a	 sum	 might	 be	 extorted	 from</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>officials	of	the	university	for	his	return.	Knowing	the	stand	that	President	Lovell of	Old	Midway	has	taken	against	kidnapers,	and	the	work	the	Crime	Institute	of that	university	has	done	in	this	connection,	it	is	the	opinion	of	those	close	to	the president	that	no	ransom	will	be	paid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	have	before	us	the	question:	Was	the	Red	Rover	kidnaped	for	ransom	or	as a	 retaliation	 for	 work	 against	 master	 criminals	 carried	 on	 by	 the	 university? </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 are	 those	 who	 will	 whisper	 that	 the	 school	 against	 whom	 the	 Red	 Rover was	 to	 have	 played	 is	 behind	 this	 affair.	 This,	 to	 any	 fair-minded	 person,	 is unthinkable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sergeants	 Drew	 Lane	 and	 Tom	 Howe,	 two	 of	 the	 keenest	 young	 minds	 of	 the city’s	detective	force,	have	been	assigned	to	the	case.	It	is	the	hope	of	the	entire city	that	their	labors	will	bear	fruit	and	that	the	Red	Rover’s	beloved	sorrel	top will	be	seen	in	the	line	when	the	line-up	is	formed	for	the	greatest	game	of	the year.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	 hour	 had	 not	 passed	 after	 the	 discovery	 of	 the	 crime,	 when	 the	 broad-shouldered,	athletic	Drew	Lane,	with	derby	pushed	well	back	on	his	head,	stood beside	his	slim,	hawk-nosed	partner	overlooking	the	car	yards	at	the	spot	where the	Red	Rover	had	vanished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	have	a	look	inside	the	car,”	suggested	Howe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 look.”	 Drew	 Lane	 turned	 toward	 the	 river.	 “If	 a	 speed	 boat	 left	 the	 river near	 this	 spot,	 there’ll	 be	 marks	 to	 show.	 May	 get	 a	 sure	 tip	 showing	 the direction	she	was	headed.	That’s	important.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sergeant	Howe	swung	up	to	the	platform	of	the	car,	then	slipped	quietly	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	place	seemed	deserted.	A	double	row	of	curtains,	one	on	either	side,	flanked the	narrow,	dimly	lighted	aisle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ready	for	the	night.	All	the	other	players	get	on	at	the	depot,	I	suppose,”	Howe mumbled	in	a	low	monotone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	paused	to	look	and	listen.	He	had	always	found	a	sleeping	car,	made	up	for the	night,	a	spooky	affair.	Dim	lights,	silence,	long	rows	of	curtains.	And	behind the	 curtains,	 what?	 Death?	 Perhaps.	 Men	 have	 died	 of	 heart	 disease	 in	 their berths.	Died	of	a	knife	in	the	heart	as	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>“Capital	place	for	a	murder.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Involuntarily	he	looked	behind	him.	Had	he	caught	the	sound	of	light	footsteps? </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 no	 one	 in	 sight.	 “Boo!	 Who’d	 bother	 to	 bump	 off	 a	 city	 detective!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 laughed	 a	 low,	 unpleasant	 laugh.	 “We’re	 supposed	 to	 be	 too	 dumb	 to	 do anything	disturbing	to	criminals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	the	same!”	He	straightened	up	with	a	snap.	“This	is	a	case	where	we	 <i class="calibre3">must</i> win.	We	simply	 <i class="calibre3">must</i>!	The	Red	Rover	must	be	in	the	line-up	when	the	big	day comes.	 And	 it’s	 up	 to	 Drew	 and	 me!”	 Howe	 was	 a	 loyal	 son	 of	 Old	 Midway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Loyalty	 to	 his	 Alma	 Mater	 compelled	 him	 to	 do	 his	 best.	 More	 than	 that,	 Red Rodgers	was	the	type	he	admired,	a	silent	worker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	 works,”	 Drew	 Lane	 had	 said	 once,	 with	 a	 note	 of	 admiration	 in	 his	 voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	like	you,	Howe.	He	digs	in	and	says	never	a	word.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Digs	in,”	Howe	muttered.	“That’s	what	we	must	do;	dig	in	hard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	that	he	went	gliding	down	the	aisle	to	pause	before	Section	Nine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah!”	 he	 breathed	 as	 he	 parted	 the	 curtains.	 “Seems	 I	 am	 in	 time.	 Nothing disturbed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	keen,	hawk-like	eyes	took	in	all	at	a	glance.	The	hammock,	where	clothing was	deposited	for	the	night,	was	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	yanked	it	down	and	took	it,	clothes	and	all.	You	might	think	from	that	that Red	had	something	they	wanted	in	his	clothes.	Guess	not,	though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 eyes	 wandered	 from	 corner	 to	 corner	 of	 the	 narrow	 space.	 “Covers	 gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wrapped	him	in	them	and	tied	him	up.	Need	to	do	that.	Scrapper,	Red	is.	Take six	of	those	soft,	beer-soaked	bums	to	hold	him	if	he	had	an	even	break.	You—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	broke	off	to	stare	at	the	center	of	the	lower	sheet	which	still	remained	on	the bed.	At	its	very	center	was	a	deep	dent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stepped	there,”	he	told	himself,	“one	of	’em.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Switching	on	his	flashlight,	he	examined	the	sheet	in	minute	detail. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>“Not	a	mark,”	he	muttered.	“Take	it	along	all	the	same.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	all	goin’	t’	take	that	sheet?”	The	porter	was	at	his	elbow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure	am.”	Howe	showed	his	star. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	Mister	Police.	Ah	cain’t	stop	you.	But	t’ain’t	no	sort	of	use.	Ain’t	no marks	on	that	sheet.	I	examined	it	particular.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Were	you	here	when	the	thing	happened?”	Howe’s	eagle	eyes	snapped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	Oh,	no,	suh!	Ah	don’t	come	on	’fore	half	a	hour	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 you	 weren’t	 far	 away,”	 Howe	 thought	 to	 himself.	 “Hiding	 in	 the	 linen closet,	like	as	not.	Bribed	you,	maybe.	Wonder	how	much	it	would	cost	to	buy	a porter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	your	number?”	he	demanded	sharply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Three	 twenty-seven.”	 The	 porter’s	 wide	 eyes	 rolled.	 “But	 hones’,	 Mister Policeman,	I	don’	know	nothin’,	nothin’	at	all!	But	you	take	that	sheet,	just	take it	right	square	along.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	find	something,	Sergeant?”	a	fresh	voice	broke	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	 a	 sheet	 that	 had	 been	 stepped	 on.”	 Howe	 looked	 into	 the	 frank,	 fearless eyes	of	a	boy.	It	was	Johnny	Thompson.	You	know	Johnny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gee!”	Howe	muttered.	“I’m	glad	to	see	you!	Are	you	in	this	with	us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	my	heart	and	hand!”	The	hand	Johnny	gave	to	Howe	was	as	hard	as	a	rock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	will	be	a	night	and	day	affair.	I’m	glad.	That’s	the	sort	I	like.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Day	and	night	and	all	the	time,”	Howe	answered.	“But	let’s	get	out	of	here.	The section	is	due	to	move,	and	I’ve	finished.	Drew’s	scouting	around	down	by	the river.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus,	 while	 the	 forces	 that	 make	 for	 evil	 had	 been	 whirling	 Red	 Rodgers northward,	 the	 forces	 that	 make	 for	 good,	 like	 faithful	 watch	 dogs,	 were assembling,	 making	 ready	 to	 take	 up	 the	 trail,	 heedless	 of	 the	 perils	 that	 most</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>certainly	lurked	beside	the	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 pair	 had	 just	 alighted	 from	 the	 car	 when	 of	 a	 sudden	 a	 startling	 figure appeared	 before	 them.	 Rounding	 the	 end	 of	 the	 car	 it	 started	 toward	 them—a skeleton	with	bones	bleached	white,	a	white	robe	flowing	behind	it!	This	was	the form	that	in	the	dim	light	of	the	car-yard	approached	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	an	involuntary	exclamation	Johnny	started	back.	Not	Tom	Howe.	With	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">spring	 of	 a	 panther	 he	 was	 upon	 the	 creature.	 Next	 instant	 he	 was	 sprawling upon	the	ground.	He	had	received	such	a	blow	on	the	head	as	put	him	out	for	the count	 of	 ten.	 Then,	 with	 a	 laugh	 as	 hollow	 as	 a	 voice	 from	 a	 graveyard	 at midnight,	 the	 skeleton	 set	 off	 at	 a	 long	 striding	 gallop.	 He	 was	 lost	 from	 sight before	Johnny	could	recover	from	his	surprise	or	Tom	Howe	could	scramble	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A—a	galloping	ghost!”	Johnny	exclaimed,	as	he	bent	over	his	companion.	“Are you	hurt?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No—not	much.”	Howe	was	coming	round.	“Hardly	at	all.	But,	man!	Oh,	man! </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	hard	knuckles	that	ghost	has!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	this?	A	ghost?”	Once	more	a	new	voice	broke	in	upon	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	looked	up,	then	scowled.	He	had	recognized	the	voice	of	a	reporter	from the	 city’s	 pink	 journal.	 He	 hated	 the	 paper	 and	 disliked	 this	 reporter.	 But	 when one	speaks	of	a	ghost	he	needs	must	explain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Explain	he	did,	and	that	with	the	least	possible	number	of	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	ghost!	A	galloping	ghost	on	the	scene	of	a	kidnaping	that	is	sure	to	cause	a nation-wide	search!	What	a	scoop!”	The	reporter	was	away	even	before	Johnny</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	completed	his	meager	description. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	galloping	ghost.”	Johnny	pronounced	the	words	slowly	as	Howe,	now	quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">recovered,	stood	up	beside	him,	then	scowled.	“What	do	you	make	of	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	a	thing,”	Howe	answered	bluntly.	“But,	after	all,	the	real	question	is,	is	this ghost	for	us	or	against	us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	ghosts	always	take	sides?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>“Oh,	 inevitably!”	 Howe	 laughed	 a	 short	 cackling	 laugh	 that	 went	 far	 toward relieving	the	tension	of	the	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come!”	he	said.	“Let’s	see	what	Drew	has	been	doing.	He—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Watch	out!	Duck!”	Seizing	Johnny’s	arm	with	a	vice-like	grip,	he	dragged	him down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	an	instant	too	soon.	There	came	the	crack	of	a	pistol,	followed	by	the	dull thwack	of	a	bullet	against	the	side	of	the	car	just	over	their	heads.	And	after	that a	cold,	dead	silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a><b class="calibre4">CHAPTER	V</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">RED	WINS	TO	LOSE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Drew	Lane,	Tom	Howe’s	team	mate,	had	not	seen	the	Galloping	Ghost.	In	truth</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 was	 some	 distance	 from	 the	 sleeping	 car	 to	 the	 river	 bank.	 After	 picking	 his way	 across	 the	 tracks,	 flashing	 his	 light	 this	 way	 and	 that	 in	 search	 of	 clues—</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	article	dropped	in	hasty	flight,	a	broken	match,	a	cigaret	thrown	away—he came	at	last	to	a	narrow	stretch	of	rock-strewn,	cinder-embedded	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here	 his	 mood	 changed.	 Snapping	 off	 his	 light,	 he	 thrust	 one	 hand	 deep	 in	 his coat	pocket	and	sauntered	forward	like	some	college	youth	taking	the	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	Drew	Lane’s	favorite	pose.	With	his	faultless	derby,	his	spotless	suit	of sea-green	and	his	natty	tie,	he	carried	it	off	well.	Many	a	tough	egg	had	called him	 a	 “fresh	 college	 kid,”	 only	 to	 find	 himself	 the	 next	 moment	 lying	 on	 the sidewalk	feeling	of	a	lump	on	his	jaw	caused	only	by	Drew’s	capable	fist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	fist	at	this	moment	was	curled	around	a	nasty	looking	thing	of	blue	steel.	At a	 second’s	 notice	 Drew	 could	 set	 that	 blue	 steel	 pal	 of	 his	 spouting	 fire,	 right through	 his	 pocket.	 And	 his	 aim,	 while	 indulging	 in	 this	 type	 of	 shooting,	 was the	despair	of	all	evil	doers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drew	 was	 approaching	 what	 appeared	 to	 be	 a	 dangerous	 spot.	 In	 the	 half darkness	before	him	a	great	steam	shovel	mounted	on	a	dredge	stood	with	crane outstretched	 like	 some	 fabled	 bird	 ready	 to	 bend	 down	 and	 pluck	 his	 lifeless body	 from	 the	 river.	 Plenty	 there	 were,	 too,	 who	 would	 have	 witnessed	 the	 act with	a	grunt	of	satisfaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 he	 approached	 the	 dredge	 a	 small	 craft,	 moored	 ahead	 of	 the	 dredge	 and smelling	strongly	of	fish,	gave	forth	a	hollow	bump-bump. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fearlessly	 the	 young	 detective	 hopped	 aboard	 this	 fishing	 schooner.	 For	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>moment	his	light	flashed	here	and	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	one,”	he	muttered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hopping	 ashore,	 he	 made	 his	 way	 to	 the	 scow	 supporting	 the	 dredge.	 Having reached	it,	he	dropped	on	hands	and	knees,	to	creep	its	entire	length.	From	time to	 time,	 with	 the	 aid	 of	 his	 flashlight,	 he	 examined	 several	 posts	 and	 the	 outer surface	of	the	scow.	When	at	last	he	stood	once	more	upon	his	feet	it	was	with	a grunt	of	satisfaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Went	 south,”	 he	 muttered.	 “Speed	 boat,	 all	 right.	 Wonder	 how	 far?	 Go	 up	 the river	in	the	morning.	Find	out—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	thoughts	were	broken	short	off	by	the	bark	of	an	automatic.	One	shot,	that was	all;	then	silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 the	 spring	 of	 a	 panther	 Drew	 was	 off	 the	 barge,	 across	 the	 narrow	 open space	and	lost	in	the	labyrinth	of	sleeping	cars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 an	 astonishingly	 short	 time	 he	 was	 close	 to	 the	 scene	 of	 the	 mysterious kidnaping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tom!	Tom	Howe!”	he	called	softly.	“Are	you	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	came	no	answer.	Only	from	the	river	came	the	hollow	bump-bump	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fishing	schooner.	“Tom!	Tom	Howe!”	he	called.	Still	no	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	 without	 warning,	 the	 car	 before	 him	 began	 to	 move.	 For	 lack	 of	 a	 better thing	to	do,	he	hopped	aboard	and	went	rattling	away	into	the	city’s	great	depot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">* 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 *</p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	during	this	same	night,	at	a	somewhat	later	hour,	that	Red	Rodgers	and	the mysterious	girl	stood	in	the	obscurity	of	the	cabin	doorway.	Breathing	hard	and peering	out	into	the	night,	they	were	poised	as	if	for	flight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 slight	 hold	 of	 the	 lock	 had	 been	 broken.	 They	 were	 free	 to	 go.	 But	 which way?	 They	 were	 on	 an	 island.	 How	 long	 was	 this	 island?	 How	 large	 was	 the island?	 What	 was	 its	 nature?	 Was	 it	 all	 tangled	 forest?	 Were	 there	 trails, clearings,	deserted	cabins?	To	these	questions	Red	could	form	no	answers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>“We’d	better	have	a	try	for	their	boat,”	he	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	answer	the	girl	pressed	his	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 together	 they	 stole	 out	 in	 the	 night.	 The	 shadow	 of	 a	 giant	 spruce	 tree swallowed	them	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	that,	to	an	impersonal	observer	there	might	have	appeared	a	gliding	bit	of darkness	from	time	to	time,	followed	by	two	black	figures	leaping	at	one	another by	the	foot	of	the	small	dock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	action	of	the	figures	increased	in	its	intensity,	yet	there	was	no	sound.	They writhed	 and	 twisted.	 One	 went	 down	 upon	 a	 knee,	 but	 was	 up	 again	 on	 the instant.	They	went	over	in	a	heap	to	roll	upon	the	ground.	They	tumbled	about until	they	reached	the	dock	and	all	but	tumbled	into	the	icy	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	as	suddenly	as	it	began,	the	struggle	ceased. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 ten	 brief	 seconds	 one	 figure	 sat	 upon	 his	 opponent.	 Then	 he	 beckoned.	 A third	 figure	 appeared.	 Groping	 about	 the	 dock,	 this	 figure	 at	 last	 seized	 upon some	object	that	cast	little	shadow.	This	it	handed	to	the	crouching	figure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	seconds	of	suspense,	and	at	last	two	figures,	one	tall,	one	short,	stood	side by	side	looking	at	the	water	and	the	dock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 they	 stood	 there,	 some	 trick	 of	 the	 moonlight	 and	 shadows	 made	 their	 two forms	 appear	 to	 melt	 into	 one;	 and	 that	 form	 presented	 a	 spectacle	 of	 abject despair.	Thirty	seconds	this	pose	was	held.	Then	the	shadow	appeared	to	explode and	two	figures	melted	into	the	shadows	to	the	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	had	happened?	Red	Rodgers	had	fought	a	battle	and	won,	only	to	find	that he	 had	 in	 reality	 lost.	 While	 groping	 his	 way	 toward	 the	 dock	 he	 had	 been detected	and	pounced	upon	by	the	kidnapers’	guard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	earliest	childhood	Red	had	been	prepared.	A	boy,	reared	among	the	tough fists	of	a	steel	town	school,	must	be.	When,	in	his	teens,	he	had	wrestled	with	red hot	 steel,	 this	 instinct	 for	 absolute	 preparedness	 had	 been	 intensified.	 Football had	added	to	this	training.	When	one	considers	that	he	was	as	quick	as	a	panther, as	strong	as	a	lion	and	as	cool-headed	as	a	prize	fighter,	one	must	know	that	the flabby	 guard	 stood	 little	 chance.	 Instantly	 Red’s	 arm	 was	 about	 his	 neck	 in	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>clinch	that	prevented	the	least	outcry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 outcome	 of	 the	 battle	 you	 already	 know;	 but	 not	 quite.	 When	 the	 boy	 had conquered	 his	 opponent,	 when	 he	 had	 bound	 and	 gagged	 him,	 he	 went	 to	 look for	the	rowboat.	Then	it	was	that	his	lips	formed	a	single	word:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gone!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	the	girl,	who	in	the	moonlight	seemed	pitifully	small,	echoed:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gone!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where	 was	 this	 boat?	 Had	 it	 drifted	 away?	 Or	 had	 a	 second	 kidnaper	 rowed away	to	a	second	island,	lying	a	stone’s	throw	away,	for	help? </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	 answer	 could	 be	 found.	 One	 thing	 remained	 to	 be	 done:	 to	 vanish	 into	 the night.	This	the	strange	pair	lost	no	time	in	doing. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">THE	RED	ROVER	GETS	THE	BREAKS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Drew	Lane	entered	his	room	at	three	o’clock	that	morning.	He	and	Tom	Howe</p>
<p class="calibre1">occupied	a	room	together	in	the	Hotel	Starling.	It	was	a	very	large	place.	Their room	was	on	the	top	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Throwing	his	coat	over	a	chair	he	sank	into	a	place	by	a	table	in	the	corner	and allowing	his	head	to	drop	on	his	arm	tried	to	collect	his	thoughts.	He	had	been following	clues.	A	reporter	from	the	News	had	given	him	a	“hot	tip”	that	grew cold	 almost	 at	 once.	 Casey	 from	 the	 State	 Street	 Police	 Station	 had	 given	 him another.	 It	 had	 led	 to	 nothing.	 After	 that	 he	 had	 begun	 setting	 traps.	 Calling	 in three	 trusted	 stool-pigeons,	 he	 had	 laid	 out	 their	 tasks	 for	 them.	 Having consulted	 his	 chief,	 he	 had	 begun	 laying	 plans	 for	 raiding	 all	 known	 hang-outs for	kidnaping	gangs.	After	that	he	had	picked	up	a	copy	of	the	city’s	pink	sheet and	had	read	in	glaring	headlines:</p>
<p class="calibre1">GHOST	NO	LONGER	WALKS.	HE	GALLOPS. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	read	with	some	surprise	the	story	of	the	Galloping	Ghost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rotten	bit	of	sensation,”	he	muttered.	“I	saw	no	ghost.	Don’t	believe	Howe	did either.	But	that	shot?	Who	fired	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 glanced	 at	 Howe’s	 bed	 in	 the	 corner.	 Howe	 lay	 across	 it	 fully	 clad,	 sound asleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like	to	ask	him,”	Drew	muttered.	“Like—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 made	 a	 sudden	 move	 with	 his	 arm.	 Some	 unusually	 hard	 object	 rested beneath	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	his	surprise	he	found	on	the	table	a	coarse	brown	envelope.	On	the	face	of	it</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>was	scrawled:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Sergeants	Lane	and	Howe. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning	 it	 over,	 he	 dumped	 its	 contents	 upon	 the	 table.	 A	 handful	 of	 shavings and	one	very	misshapen	bullet,	that	was	all;	or	so	he	thought	until	he	thrust	in	a hand	and	drew	forth	a	much	crumpled	bit	of	paper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	a	quick	intake	of	breath,	he	flattened	the	paper	on	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Words	 were	 scrawled	 across	 the	 page.	 The	 writing	 was	 very	 bad,	 as	 if	 a	 right-handed	man	had	undertaken	to	write	with	his	left	hand.	In	time	he	made	out	the message. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Here	are	some	important	clues.	Guard	them	with	care.	When	raids	are	made	you</i> <i class="calibre3">will	collect	firearms.	Collect	pocket	knives	as	well.	You	will	hear	from	me	later. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">The	G.G. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some	crank,”	Drew	muttered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	a	thought	struck	him	all	of	a	heap.	How	had	the	message	gotten	into	their room? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Howe	brought	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	 That	 is	 impossible.	 Had	 he	 read	 that	 note	 he	 would	 have	 folded	 it	 neatly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	Howe	every	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	 here	 was	 fresh	 mystery.	 And	 what	 of	 these	 clues?	 A	 bullet.	 That	 was always	important.	But	where	had	it	been	found?	He	examined	it	closely.	“Wood sticking	to	it,”	he	muttered.	“Been	dug	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	what	of	the	shavings?	These	too	he	examined.	After	studying	them	carefully he	was	convinced	that	some	one,	while	waiting	for	a	second	person	perhaps,	had occupied	his	time	whittling	a	bit	of	soft	wood	he	had	picked	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	world	is	strewn	with	such	piles	made	by	whittle-bugs,”	he	told	himself.	He was	tempted	to	toss	them	into	the	waste	paper	basket.	Instead	he	slid	them	back into	the	envelope. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>After	 that	 he	 read	 the	 note	 through	 again.	 “Collect	 pocket	 knives.”	 His	 voice took	on	a	note	of	disgust.	“What	could	be	the	good	of	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘You	will	hear	from	me	again.’	Well,	here’s	hoping.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 threw	 the	 envelope	 to	 a	 back	 corner	 of	 the	 table.	 But	 startling	 revelations would	drag	it	again	to	the	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Collect	pocket	knives.”	Down	deep	in	his	heart	he	knew	that	he	would	start	this collection	to-morrow.	He	hated	doing	silly	things.	But	more	than	this	he	dreaded making	fatal	blunders.	“A	clue	is	a	clue,”	he	had	said	many	times,	“be	it	faint	as a	moon	at	midday.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">* 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 *</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	battle	Red	Rodgers	waged	after	leaving	the	cabin	at	the	edge	of	the	narrow clearing	 on	 that	 mysterious	 island	 was	 something	 quite	 outside	 his	 past experience.	 True,	 he	 was	 not	 unacquainted	 with	 struggle	 and	 peril.	 More	 than once	in	the	vast	steel	mill	he	had	watched	hot	sheet	steel,	caught	by	a	defective roller,	curl	itself	into	a	serpent	of	fire,	and	had	dodged	in	the	nick	of	time.	On	the gridiron,	with	mad	crowds	screaming,	with	forms	leaping	at	him	from	right	and left,	he	had	over	and	over	battled	his	way	to	victory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	he	faced	neither	man-made	steel	nor	man	himself,	but	nature.	Before	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	dark	lay	a	primeval	wilderness;	a	small	wilderness,	to	be	sure,	but	a	real one	for	all	that.	Here,	on	a	rocky	ridge	scarcely	one	hundred	yards	wide,	for	ages without	number	trees	had	fought	a	battle	to	the	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	not	gone	a	dozen	paces	when	he	tripped	and	fell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	felt	ashamed	that	the	girl	must	put	out	a	slender	hand	to	guide	him.	“I—I’ve never	been	in	a	forest,”	he	half	apologized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	even	by	day?”	The	girl’s	awed	whisper	showed	her	astonishment.	Her	next remark	gave	him	a	shock.	“Then	you	have	never	truly	lived.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gladly	 would	 he	 have	 argued	 this	 point.	 But	 this	 was	 no	 time	 for	 mere	 talk.	 It was	a	time	for	action.	They	were	on	an	island	within	a	bay.	The	bay	reached	far, to	a	larger	island.	The	larger	island	was	far	from	the	mainland.	If	the	kidnaper’s statement	was	to	be	accepted,	there	were	no	people	on	this	larger	island	save	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>kidnapers	themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 wonder	 if	 there	 are	 other	 cabins	 on	 this	 island?”	 He	 whispered	 this	 more	 to himself	than	to	the	girl.	She	answered	nevertheless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	are	none.	We	must	get	away	as	far	as	we	can.	To	the	far	end	of	the	island. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 we	 must	 think	 what	 is	 to	 be	 done	 next.	 Come,	 we	 must	 go.	 Follow	 close behind	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	full	half	hour	after	that	they	waged	a	silent	battle	with	nature.	Over	fallen trees	 that	 now	 tore	 at	 them	 with	 their	 tangled	 branches	 and	 now	 sank treacherously	 beneath	 their	 feet,	 around	 rocky	 ridges	 that	 offered	 dangerous descents	 into	 tiny	 valleys	 so	 dark	 that	 one	 might	 not	 see	 his	 hand	 before	 him, they	struggled	on	until	with	a	sigh	the	girl	whispered:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	trail.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Too	 engrossed	 was	 Red	 in	 the	 unaccustomed	 struggle	 to	 ask:	 “What	 has	 made this	trail?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	soon	enough	to	know.	In	his	pocket	he	carried	a	small	flashlight.	Judging that	they	were	now	far	enough	from	the	cabin	to	use	this,	he	pressed	the	button, then	cast	the	light	down	the	trail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instantly	he	sprang	back.	The	light	was	reflected	by	a	pair	of	large	and	burning eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	confused	impression	of	brown	hair,	of	antlers	like	spiked	slabs	of	wood,	and those	burning	eyes	held	him	rooted	to	the	spot	until	the	girl’s	hand	at	his	elbow guided	 him	 off	 the	 trail	 and	 into	 the	 broad-spreading	 branches	 of	 a	 fir	 tree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There,	after	a	false	step,	he	tumbled	into	the	fragrant	boughs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	 willing	 it,	 he	 drew	 the	 girl	 after	 him.	 After	 that,	 for	 a	 full	 moment	 he remained	half	reclining,	feeling	the	wild	beating	of	the	girl’s	heart	and	listening for	he	scarcely	knew	what. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 he	 heard	 the	 sound	 he	 recognized	 it;	 a	 slow,	 soft-padded	 plump-plump, and	he	was	relieved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	thing	we	have	met	on	the	trail,”	he	told	himself,	“was	not	a	horned	demon, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>but	 a	 giant	 moose.”	 That	 he	 had	 been	 utterly	 at	 a	 loss,	 and	 that	 the	 girl	 had directed	their	course	in	a	safe	and	sensible	manner,	he	also	recognized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	listening	to	the	padded	footsteps	until	they	faded	out	into	the	silence	of	the night,	he	assisted	the	girl	to	her	feet	and	whispered:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	are	not	a	real	person.	You	come	from	a	book.	Your	name	is	Alice,	and	we are	having	adventures	in	Wonderland.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	real	enough.”	She	laughed	a	low	laugh.	“My	name	is	not	Alice,	but	Berley Todd.	 I	 am	 five	 feet	 tall	 and	 I	 weigh	 ninety	 pounds.	 My	 favorite	 dish	 is blueberries	with	ice	cream	on	top.”	She	laughed	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	that	moose,	I	suppose,	was	quite	an	old	friend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	suppose	not.	But	a	moose	will	not	harm	you	if	you	give	him	the	right	of	way, which	I	suppose	is	fair	enough	since	this	is	his	forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	come.	We	must	be	near	the	end	of	the	island.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	did	not	ask,	“How	do	you	know	this?”	He	merely	followed	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scarcely	 a	 moment	 had	 passed	 when	 they	 came	 out	 upon	 a	 pebbly	 shore.	 And there,	 as	 he	 flashed	 his	 light	 about,	 he	 discovered	 a	 nondescript	 raft	 of	 spruce logs.	 Dragged	 half	 way	 up	 on	 the	 shore,	 it	 seemed	 for	 all	 its	 crudeness	 to	 be	 a rather	substantial	affair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	suppose,”	he	said	in	a	low	tone,	“that	this	entire	affair	has	been	arranged.	You knew	the	raft	was	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Becoming	suspicious,	he	flashed	his	light	into	a	pair	of	very	innocent-appearing blue	 eyes.	 “I	 suppose,”	 he	 said	 slowly,	 “you	 know	 why	 I	 have	 been	 carried away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	you?”	The	eyes	opened	wide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	I	live,	no.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	 you’ll	 have	 to	 ask	 some	 one	 else.	 It’s	 plain	 enough	 why	 they	 took	 me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Want	my	dad’s	money.	Expect	my	help	in	getting	it.	They’ll	have	no	help	from</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>me! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 now,	 Mister	 Man-who-don’t-know-why-he’s-here,	 let’s	 thank	 kind</p>
<p class="calibre1">Providence	for	this	raft	which	some	summer	fisherman	left	here,	and	shove	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looks	like	we	might	go	across	with	nothing	more	than	wet	feet.	What	luck!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	what	do	you	think	is	on	the	other	shore?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cabins.	Cabins	and	cottages,	fireplaces,	blankets,	easy	chairs,	and	things	to	eat; not	so	near,	but	not	so	far	away,	either.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	stared	at	her	in	silence.	Did	this	girl	speak	from	knowledge	of	the	island,	or was	she	romancing,	bolstering	up	courage	with	dreams	that	might	prove	false? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	dared	not	ask.	Putting	his	stout	shoulders	to	work	at	shoving	off	the	raft,	he had	 it	 afloat	 at	 once.	 Then,	 after	 selecting	 a	 stout	 spruce	 pole	 and	 assisting	 the girl	to	a	place	beside	him,	he	shoved	away	toward	that	other	shore	that,	looming dark	 and	 distant,	 seemed	 to	 beckon	 and	 to	 whisper	 of	 “cabins	 and	 fireplaces, blankets,	easy	chairs,	and	things	to	eat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,”	he	sighed,	“thus	far	we	get	the	breaks.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">A	JOURNEY	IN	THE	NIGHT</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">While	 Drew	 Lane	 sat	 meditating	 on	 the	 various	 aspects	 of	 the	 kidnaping,	 Tom Howe	groaned	and	sat	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Drew,”	he	drawled,	rubbing	his	head,	“I’ve	been	felled	by	a	ghost,	a	galloping ghost.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	mean	to	say	you	believe	that	stuff!”	Drew	held	up	the	pink	sheet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	believe,”	said	Howe	with	a	wry	grin,	“that	I	have	a	large	lump	on	the	top	of my	head	and	that	it’s	sore.	I	believe	it	was	put	there	by	a	thing	that	looked	like	a ghost.	That’s	all	I	have	to	say	about	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 then,	 what	 have	 you	 to	 say	 about	 this?”	 Drew	 held	 up	 the	 envelope containing	the	shavings	and	bullet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drew	showed	him	the	contents	and	read	the	note. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Curious	sort	of	writing,”	he	ended.	“And	look	how	he	signed	it:	‘The	G.G.’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That,”	drawled	Howe,	“could	stand	for	‘The	Galloping	Ghost.’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 <i class="calibre3">must</i>!”	Drew	struck	the	table	with	his	fist.	“But	why	all	the	secrecy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That,”	 Howe	 replied	 thoughtfully,	 “will	 probably	 come	 out	 later.	 The	 only question	that	matters	seems	to	be:	Is	this	ghost	with	us	or	against	us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With	us.	Can’t	be	any	doubt	about	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>“Then	we’d	better	follow	his	suggestions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Collect	pocket	knives?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	not?	Interesting	collection.	What	sort	of	knives	do	crooks	carry?	Bet	you can’t	tell.	Well,	now	we’ll	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Guess	you’re	right.	But	say!”	Drew	exclaimed.	“What	did	you	get	from	the	car, the	one	the	Red	Rover	was	snatched	from?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	bed	sheet.”	Howe	held	it	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Marked?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	a	mark.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	what—?”	Drew	stared	at	his	partner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some	one	had	stepped	on	the	bed,	probably	with	his	shoe	on.	I	thought	I’d	try the	ultra-violet	ray	on	it.	Surprising	what	it	brings	out	sometimes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Probably	 worth	 a	 try.”	 Drew	 was	 not	 enthusiastic.	 Howe	 had	 gone	 in	 for scientific	 crime	 detection	 lately.	 Drew	 was	 still	 for	 going	 out	 and	 getting	 his man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Howe,”	he	demanded	after	a	moment	of	silence,	“who	fired	that	shot	back	there in	the	train	yards?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 answer	 that.	 A	 hand	 was	 all	 I	 saw,	 a	 hand	 thrust	 out	 from	 behind	 a	 car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fired	point-blank	at	me.	And	missed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 may	 be	 the	 bullet,”	 Drew	 mused,	 weighing	 the	 battered	 bullet	 from	 the mystery	envelope	in	his	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 might	 be.	 Don’t	 seem	 likely,	 though.	 That	 bullet	 struck	 the	 side	 of	 a	 steel car.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Might	 have	 glanced.	 Mighty	 fine	 evidence.	 Find	 the	 gun	 that	 fired	 this	 bullet and	 you’ve	 got	 the	 man.	 Gun	 scratches	 the	 bullet	 as	 no	 other	 gun	 would. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Microscope	brings	out	that,	doesn’t	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>“Sure	does.	You	find	the	man	and	his	gun.	I’ll	do	the	rest.”	Howe	gave	vent	to	a low	chuckle.	“Nothing	would	please	me	more!	Not	a	nice	thing,	this	being	shot at.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kidnapers	 are	 not	 nice	 people.”	 Drew’s	 tone	 changed.	 “Fact	 is,	 they’re	 about the	worst	people	in	all	the	world.	Should	be	shot	at	sunrise,	every	man	of	’em. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 not	 so	 bad,”	 he	 philosophized,	 “stealing	 diamonds.	 They’re	 only	 a	 lot	 of stones	after	all.	And	money.	‘Who	steals	my	purse	steals	trash.	’Twas	mine.	’Tis his,	and	has	been	a	curse	to	thousands.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	think!”	He	sprang	to	his	feet.	“Think	of	the	cowards	that	steal	a	human	life, a	 helpless	 woman,	 an	 innocent	 child,	 and	 then	 send	 back	 word,	 ‘Money,	 much money,	or	we	will	take	the	life	of	this	one	we	have	snatched.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“That—why,	that’s	like	going	into	battle	holding	a	woman	before	you	to	stop	the bullets!	 Howe,	 old	 boy,	 we’ve	 got	 a	 task	 laid	 out	 for	 us,	 a	 man-sized	 task,	 and we’re	going	to	do	it!	You	see	if	we	don’t!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Howe	smiled	in	a	quiet	way.	A	quiet	chap,	was	this	slender	detective;	quiet,	but feared	in	the	underworld	as	many	a	big	blustering	cop	was	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Drew,”	he	said	after	a	long	silence,	“why	did	they	snatch	the	Red	Rover?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Revenge,	 perhaps.	 The	 university	 has	 been	 fighting	 kidnapers.	 Think	 what	 a bold	 stroke	 it	 would	 be	 to	 carry	 off	 their	 super-star	 just	 a	 few	 days	 before	 the final	great	game	of	the	season!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sounds	 pretty,”	 said	 Howe	 thoughtfully.	 “But	 it	 doesn’t	 click.	 Crooks	 waste little	time	on	revenge.	Dough	is	what	they	are	after.	Money.	Money.	Money.	That is	their	long	cry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	where’s	there	money	in	snatching	a	football	star?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	knows?	Perhaps	they’re	being	paid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Paid?	By	whom?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Northern	wants	to	win.	Isn’t	Northern	Old	Midway’s	ancient	rival?	Doesn’t	the championship	hang	in	the	balance?	What’s	a	few	thousand	dollars	when	such	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>prize	is	at	stake?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	universities	are	not	like	that!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	the	schools.	Of	course	not.	But	alumni.	Who	can	say	what	some	rich	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">over-enthusiastic	alumnus	would	risk	to	see	that	game	won?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	much	sense	to	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	not.	But	what	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	may	be	hoping	that	Old	Midway	will	dig	deep	to	get	their	star	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	 that’s	 the	 racket	 we’ll	 know	 soon	 enough.	 There’ll	 be	 letters,	 phone	 calls, demanding	ransom.	What	say	we	turn	in?	To-morrow	is	just	around	the	corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	to-morrow	we	must	be	out	and	after	’em.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	the	first	move?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Trace	 that	 speed	 boat	 down	 the	 river,	 the	 one	 that	 carried	 him	 away.	 It	 went south,	that’s	clear	enough.	I	saw	where	they	tied	up	to	an	old	scow.	Scraped	her side	when	they	left;	rubbed	off	a	lot	of	mud.	The	shape	of	the	spot	showed	plain enough	which	way	they	were	going.	Somehow	we’ve	got	to	find	their	hide-out</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	get	the	Red	Rover	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had	the	speaker	been	privileged	to	see	the	Red	Rover	at	that	moment	ankle	deep in	icy	water,	making	his	way	as	best	he	could	with	pole	and	improvised	paddle on	a	raft	that,	turning	round	and	round,	seemed	to	go	nowhere,	he	would	surely have	understood	that	a	long	trail	lay	before	him.	Not	being	granted	such	a	vision, he	crawled	into	his	bed	and	went	sound	asleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">* 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 *</p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	no	sleep	for	Red	Rodgers	and	his	mysterious	little	friend	on	the	raft. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 had	 been	 clumsy,	 flat-bottomed	 boats	 in	 the	 rust-blackened	 slips	 where monster	ore	boats	lay	near	Red’s	boyhood	home,	but	no	rafts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	how	does	one	propel	a	raft?	By	a	long	pole	where	water	is	shallow.	But	one does	not	endeavor	to	drive	the	raft	in	the	direction	he	wishes	to	go.	He	is	more</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>likely	to	achieve	his	end	if	he	shoves	in	the	opposite	direction.	For	a	raft,	like	an ox,	a	mule	or	a	reindeer,	is	likely	to	go	its	own	cranky	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	Red	learned	soon	enough.	Scarcely	had	he	begun	poling	than	the	raft	started spinning	 like	 a	 top.	 It	 was	 only	 under	 the	 girl’s	 expert	 direction	 that	 he	 at	 last started	for	the	shore	that	loomed	dark	and	ragged	in	the	distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	had	not	gone	a	dozen	yards	when	the	bottom	sank	beneath	the	end	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pole. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	 we	 must	 paddle.”	 Heedless	 of	 the	 icy	 water,	 the	 girl	 dropped	 upon	 one knee,	seized	a	narrow	slab	of	wood	and	began	a	vigorous	dip-dip	that	in	time,	it seemed,	must	take	them	somewhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Following	her	example,	Red,	on	the	opposite	side,	did	his	bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under	this	treatment	the	raft	behaved	admirably.	Keeping	in	view	only	the	shore they	had	left,	they	paddled	for	a	good	half	hour	when,	with	a	shock	that	all	but sent	 them	 splashing	 into	 the	 water,	 they	 struck	 a	 hard	 object	 that	 gave	 out	 a hollow	sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shore?”	There	was	relief	in	Red’s	tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	 shore.”	 The	 girl	 stood	 up.	 Her	 head	 struck	 something	 and	 she	 bounced down	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thunder	and	guns!	What	now?”	Red	turned	about	to	stare	with	all	his	eyes.	The thing	they	had	bumped	into	was	a	hydroplane,	the	very	one	that	had	carried	them to	this	deserted	spot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh!”	 The	 girl	 seized	 his	 arm.	 “Can—can	 you	 fly	 it?”	 Hope	 and	 fear	 were mingled	in	her	tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I—I’m	sorry,”	Red	stammered.	“To-night	I	took	my	first	airplane	journey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	I	can’t	say	I	wanted	to	come,”	he	added	as	a	witty	afterthought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	say!”	he	exclaimed	suddenly.	“You	just	hang	on	here	a	bit.	I—I’ll	be	right back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>They	 were	 beneath	 one	 of	 the	 machine’s	 great	 wings.	 Reaching	 up,	 he	 swung himself	to	the	upper	surface,	and	disappeared	into	the	dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dangerous	 business,”	 he	 muttered	 to	 himself.	 “May	 have	 heard	 that	 bump, those	fellows.	May	see	my	light.	Might	come	upon	us	here	any	minute,	but	it’s	a chance	you	can’t	pass	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	dropping	here,	climbing	there,	then	moving	over	to	the	right,	he	reached	one of	 the	 twin	 motors.	 There,	 after	 flashing	 his	 light	 for	 a	 moment,	 he	 put	 out	 a hand,	fumbled	about,	then	pocketed	a	small	object.	These	actions	were	repeated when	he	reached	the	second	motor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	that,	with	a	sigh	of	relief,	he	dropped	back	upon	the	raft. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fix	’em!”	he	muttered.	“Fix	’em	plenty,	the	dirty	dogs! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	 come	 on.	 Let’s	 get	 out	 of	 here	 quick!	 Wish	 we	 could	 take	 one	 of	 those pontoons	for	a	boat;	but	that’s	impossible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	cloud	had	gone	over	the	moon.	He	felt	the	girl’s	cold	hand	as	she	steadied	him down	to	a	safe	place	of	balance	on	the	raft,	and	he	chided	himself	for	being	so long. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cabins,”	 he	 whispered.	 “Cabins	 with	 fireplaces,	 easy	 chairs,	 blankets,	 and things	to	eat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	this	seemed	very,	very	far	away.	And	yet	with	youth	“hope	springs	eternal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	 again	 they	 worked	 their	 imperfect	 oars.	 In	 a	 surprisingly	 short	 time	 they once	more	bumped.	With	a	low	cry	of	hope,	the	girl	sprang	ashore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	should	be	a	trail,”	she	called	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Moose	trail?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Moose	and	men.	Here!	Here	it	is!	We	go	this	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	led	on	over	a	trail	so	carpeted	with	moss	that	their	footsteps	made	no	sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	girl	knows	a	lot	about	this	island,”	Red	said	to	himself.	“How	come?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>Once	again	he	was	tempted	to	believe	that	she	was	in	league	with	the	kidnapers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	doesn’t	make	sense	either.	Mixed	up	mess.	Just	have	to	tramp	on	and	see how	it	all	comes	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	tramped	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a><b class="calibre4">CHAPTER	VIII</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">“THE	RAT” </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 path	 followed	 by	 Red	 Rodgers	 and	 the	 girl	 was	 little	 more	 than	 a	 wild animal	trail	along	the	edge	of	a	wilderness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Evening	 dew	 had	 placed	 its	 cold	 wet	 hand	 over	 all.	 Here	 they	 passed	 through clumps	 of	 alder	 that	 showered	 icy	 drops	 upon	 them,	 here	 waded	 waist	 deep	 in ferns	that	were	like	a	tossing	sea,	and	here	again	they	crowded	their	way	through clusters	of	young	spruce	huddled	close	together	like	children	afraid	of	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	had	not	gone	a	quarter	of	a	mile	when	they	were	soaked	to	the	skin.	Still, without	 a	 word,	 the	 girl,	 gripping	 Red’s	 small	 flashlight,	 trudged	 pluckily forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	could	lose	ourselves	in	this	wilderness,”	Red	commented. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	if	we	follow	the	shore.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That,	Red	told	himself,	was	true	enough.	But	where	would	the	shore	lead	them? </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	 cabins,	 fireplaces,	 chairs,	 things	 to	 eat?	 He	 fancied	 that	 this	 girl	 had	 been romancing,	dreaming	to	keep	up	her	courage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Queer	old	world,”	he	told	himself.	“Here	I	was,	twenty-four	hours	ago,	watched over	like	a	child.	Must	eat	this,	must	not	eat	that.	Must	sleep	so	long.	Was	there an	ache,	a	slight	sprain?	Send	for	the	rub-doctor.	Did	I	cough	once?	Send	in	the M.D.	 And	 now	 this.	 In	 the	 wilderness.	 Drenched	 to	 the	 skin.	 No	 doctor.	 No osteopath.	No	one	to	tell	me	what	to	eat.	Free! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	yet,	such	freedom!	I	may	be	caught	any	time	and	brought	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Back	 to	 what?”	 He	 shuddered.	 Well,	 they’d	 have	 to	 find	 him.	 That	 would	 be difficult.	And	then	they’d	have	a	fight	on	their	hands.	He	was	strong,	as	strong	as</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>a	bull	moose.	They’d	not	get	that	girl	again	without	a	fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Queer	sort	of	girl,”	he	mused.	“Queer	place	this.	You	meet	a	moose	on	the	trail, you	 politely	 step	 aside	 and	 he	 walks	 calmly	 past.	 You’d	 think	 he’d	 snort	 and vanish	or	roar	a	challenge	and	charge.	Never	heard	of	such	things.	That	girl’s	got the	place	bewitched.	I—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look!”	The	girl	had	come	to	a	halt.	One	hand	was	on	his	arm.	With	the	other she	parted	the	bushes.	“Do	you	see?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	dark	spot	over	yonder.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Y-yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	another	island.	There’s	a	cabin	on	it,	and	a	boat	house.	Boats	too.	And	in	the cabin	there	is	a	fireplace	and	easy	chairs,	blankets,	and—and	things	to	eat.”	She swayed	a	little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It—it’s	not	far.”	She	steadied	herself	on	his	arm.	“I—I	think	I	could	swim	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you’ll	not!”	Red	began	stripping	off	his	coat.	“I’ll	swim	it	and	bring	back	a boat.	Here,	hold	this.	I’ll	take	off	my	shoes,	too.	The	rest	doesn’t	matter.	I’ll	be soaked	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	moment	and	he	was	in	the	water	swimming	strongly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	was	a	fine	swimmer.	In	the	slips	where	rusty	ore	boats	lay	at	anchor	in	his home	city	he	had	learned	to	swim	before	he	could	talk	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	distance	to	the	island	he	found	surprisingly	short.	Before	he	knew	it	he	was touching	rocky	shoals	that	led	up	to	a	low	bank	lined	with	spruce	and	birches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	stood	there	shaking	the	water	from	him	like	a	spaniel,	he	saw	a	dark	bulk to	his	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Boat	 house.”	 He	 flashed	 the	 electric	 torch,	 which	 he	 had	 carried	 across	 in	 his teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>“And	there’s	the	cabin.”	Once	again	his	light	darted	about.	There	appeared	to	be a	number	of	small	cabins	grouped	around	a	larger	central	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mysterious	 sort	 of	 place!”	 he	 told	 himself.	 “Wonder	 who	 built	 it.	 Who	 lives there?	And	when?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	cold	blast	of	wind	came	sweeping	up	the	narrow	channel.	It	chilled	him	to	the bone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Going	to	storm.	I	must	get	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	 fireplace	 and	 easy	 chairs,	 blankets,	 things	 to	 eat,”	 he	 whispered	 as	 he stumbled	along	over	the	slippery	stones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	thought	of	the	girl	standing	back	there	alone,	drenched	with	dew,	chilled	by the	wind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	must	get	back.	At	once!”	He	quickened	his	steps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 reaching	 the	 shore	 side	 door	 of	 the	 boat	 house,	 he	 found	 it	 locked.	 With	 a mutter	of	disgust,	he	hurried	along	a	narrow	plank	walk	to	the	other	end.	There he	plunged	waist	deep	into	water,	to	make	his	way	beneath	the	great	outer	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Room	 for	 a	 rowboat	 beneath	 this	 door,”	 he	 murmured.	 “Let	 ’em	 keep	 their launch.	No	gas	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	swing	of	the	light	showed	him	a	sizeable	launch	suspended	above	the	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	that	which	gladdened	his	heart	was	a	staunch	little	rowboat	tipped	on	its	side and	resting	on	a	narrow	ledge	at	the	right	of	the	hole	of	black	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	 we	 ask,”	 he	 grumbled.	 “Oars?	 Ah,	 yes!	 There	 they	 are.	 Now	 to	 tip	 her over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 he	 accomplished	 without	 a	 sound.	 The	 oars	 dropped	 silently	 into	 their places.	He	was	in	the	act	of	pushing	the	boat	into	the	black	hole	of	water	when	a blood-curdling	scream,	coming	from	the	shore	side,	froze	every	drop	of	blood	in his	veins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They—they	got	her!”	he	gasped.	“And	after	all	this!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>For	 a	 space	 of	 many	 seconds	 his	 heart	 stood	 still.	 Then	 it	 raced	 like	 an	 engine without	a	governor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ve	got	her.	Will	they	keep	her?	We’ll	see!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red’s	fighting	blood	was	up.	And	could	Red	fight?	Ask	the	boys	of	the	gridiron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Count	them	as	they	go	down	before	him;	one,	two,	three.	Yes,	Red	could	fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	could	fight	steel	and	had;	could	fight	hard	opponents	on	the	gridiron.	And	as for	 these	 kidnapers—dirty	 dogs,	 buzzards,	 beasts	 in	 human	 form—he’d	 show</p>
<p class="calibre1">’em! </p>
<p class="calibre1">* 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 *</p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 at	 this	 same	 hour	 that	 Tom	 Howe	 received	 a	 visitor,	 and	 a	 very	 curious specimen	 of	 humanity	 he	 was.	 You	 will	 need	 to	 become	 well	 acquainted	 with him,	as	he	plays	an	important	role	in	our	story.	That	is	one	of	the	jolly	features	of this	life	we	live;	on	life’s	stage	the	humblest	individual	can,	and	often	does,	play an	important	role. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	visitor,	who	knocked	timidly	on	the	young	detective’s	door	just	as	he	was dressing,	was	known	all	up	and	down	the	river	front	as	“The	Rat.”	I	say	he	was known;	the	truth	is	that	he	was	known	to	but	a	few.	As	a	sort	of	compensation, those	few	knew	him	very	well.	Tom	Howe	knew	him	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	a	curious	occupation,	did	the	Rat.	He	found	out	things	that	people	wished to	 know.	 And	 his	 particular	 province	 was	 the	 river.	 He	 never	 left	 it	 save	 to deliver	 a	 message.	 At	 night,	 in	 a	 narrow	 boat,	 little	 more	 than	 a	 canoe	 and painted	dark	gray	inside	and	out,	he	might	have	been	seen	cruising	up	and	down the	 river.	 Or	 rather,	 he	 was	 not	 likely	 to	 be	 seen;	 his	 craft	 and	 his	 dirty,	 dull-colored	garb	blended	in	with	breakwaters,	with	piles	and	all	manner	of	dark	and shadowy	places. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus	 the	 Rat	 lurked	 about	 the	 river	 at	 night,	 gathering	 scraps	 of	 information which	might	be	sold	for	a	price	to	certain	gentlemen	who	wished	to	know	such things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Was	 the	 Rat	 particular	 regarding	 the	 character	 of	 his	 customers?	 Probably	 not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	were	favored	before	others,	for	all	that.	Tom	Howe	and	Johnny	Thompson</p>
<p class="calibre1">might	 have	 his	 services	 at	 their	 very	 best,	 and	 that	 with	 no	 thought	 of	 charge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every	creature,	even	a	rat,	has	a	sense	of	gratitude.	Johnny	Thompson,	who,	as</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>you	will	recall,	was	a	great	friend	of	Drew	Lane	and	Tom	Howe,	had	once	found the	Rat	dying	of	fever.	He	and	Howe	had	saved	him	from	the	hospital,	which	he dreaded	with	the	fear	of	death,	by	hiring	a	nurse	to	care	for	him	in	his	river	front hovel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now,	 after	 an	 all-night	 search	 at	 Howe’s	 request,	 he	 had	 something	 of importance	to	report. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Rat	had	a	way	of	seeming	in	a	great	rush.	He	puffed	as	he	talked	and	from time	to	time	his	sharp	nose	shot	forward,	his	small	black	eyes	popped	just	as	a rat’s	will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dat	 speed	 boat,	 it—it—dat	 boat,”	 he	 puffed	 now,	 “you	 know	 de	 Wop	 what camps	under	de	Twelfth	Street	bridge?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I	know,”	Howe	replied	eagerly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“De	Wop	saw	it.	Fine	speed	boat.	Very	fast.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	color?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Col-color?	Can’t	see.	Too	dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	de	Chink	got	laundry	by	de	river	just	past	de	scrap	yard?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I	know	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	heard	de	speed	boat.”	The	Rat	took	a	turn	around	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	it	went	that	far?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dat	far!”	The	Rat	bulged	his	eyes.	“Dat’s	not	a	start.	You	know	de	t’ree	bums dat	hang	round	de	old	warehouse	way	down	de	river,	de	big	warehouse?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dey	saw	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 not	 strange,”	 Drew	 Lane	 put	 in.	 “A	 speed	 boat	 comes	 near	 being	 a curiosity	that	far	down	the	river.	They’d	be	sure	to	notice	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>“Dat’s	it.”	The	Rat	took	another	turn	around	the	room.	“Dat’s	what	I	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 know	 de	 gypsies	 campin’	 by	 de	 river?	 Cottonwood	 trees	 grow	 on	 dat place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	I	know	the	place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dey	don’t	see	it,	don’t	hear	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	they	were	asleep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 no.	 Not	 dat.	 Squattin’	 by	 de	 fire,	 playin’	 cards.	 Dey	 don’t	 hear	 dat	 boat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Don’t	see	it,	I	tell	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then,”	 said	 Drew	 Lane,	 “our	 search	 narrows.	 The	 boat	 landed	 somewhere between	the	old	warehouse	and	the	gypsy	camp.	Can’t	be	more	than	six	blocks</p>
<p class="calibre1">apart.	Let’s	see,	what’s	out	that	way?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some	homes,”	said	Howe.	“Some	shacks—abandoned,	tumble-down	places—a</p>
<p class="calibre1">roadhouse	or	two.	The	airport	is	not	far	away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 right,	 the	 airport.”	 Drew	 said	 these	 words	 with	 little	 animation.	 At	 that moment	 the	 airport	 did	 not	 enter	 deeply	 into	 his	 conscious	 thoughts.	 In	 time	 it was	to	take	on	a	deep	significance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	Rat.	Good	work!	Here’s	your	breakfast.”	Howe	pressed	a	bill	into	the Rat’s	paw-like	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	this	instant	there	came	a	loud	banging	at	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	a	startled	glance	the	Rat	sprang	for	a	second	door	at	the	opposite	end	of	the room.	This	door	opened	into	Tom	Howe’s	tiny	laboratory	for	the	scientific	study of	crime.	The	window	of	this	room	looked	out	on	the	fire	escape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neither	Drew	Lane	nor	Tom	Howe	paid	the	slightest	attention	to	the	Rat’s	going. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	by	nature	what	his	name	implied;	a	loud	banging	at	any	door	found	him seeking	a	hole	through	which	he	might	escape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who’s	that	at	this	hour	of	the	morning?”	Drew	grumbled. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a>“Search	me.”	Tom	Howe	slipped	a	blue-barreled	automatic	into	his	coat	pocket, gripped	it	firmly	in	his	left	hand,	then	threw	the	door	wide,	to	exclaim:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh!	So	it’s	you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a><b class="calibre4">CHAPTER	IX</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">RED	GOES	INTO	ACTION</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">All	his	life	Red	Rodgers	had	been	trained	for	action.	In	the	steel	mills	there	come times	when	men	are	divided	into	two	classes,	the	quick	and	the	dead.	Red	was not	dead.	The	instant	that	piercing	cry,	coming	from	the	opposite	shore,	reached his	ears,	he	was	alert,	ready	to	act.	His	hand,	already	on	the	side	of	the	rowboat, relaxed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oars	creak,”	he	murmured. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Across	the	dark	pool	rested	a	canoe.	He	was	there	in	a	flash,	canoe	in	the	water, paddle	in	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	a	weapon!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was,	of	course,	unarmed.	As	his	eyes	roved	about	in	that	narrow	space,	they fell	 upon	 a	 pike	 pole.	 With	 a	 stout	 eight-foot	 handle	 and	 a	 steel	 point	 it	 was	 a weapon	of	a	sort,	spear	or	club,	whichever	he	might	choose.	Reaching	for	this, he	placed	it	without	a	sound	in	the	canoe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he	slid	out	into	the	silent	night.	The	wind,	he	found,	was	growing	stronger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	chilled	him	through.	“Be	warm	enough	soon.”	He	set	his	teeth	grimly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Waves	sweeping	in	from	somewhere	down	the	channel	threatened	to	overturn	his fragile	 craft.	 He	 handled	 it	 with	 skill.	 Great	 black	 banks	 of	 cloud	 came	 rolling across	the	sky.	The	darkness	was	intense;	yet	he	knew	his	direction.	He	pressed forward—to	what?	He	could	not	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	it’s	a	fight,	it	will	be	a	good	one.”	His	hands	grasped	the	paddle	with	a	grip	of steel.	“God	is	on	the	side	of	the	fellow	who	fights	for	the	right.	There’s	nothing right	 about	 men	 who	 carry	 away	 innocent	 girls	 and	 then	 demand	 a	 reward	 for their	return!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>He	 was	 sending	 the	 canoe	 forward	 with	 strong,	 sweeping	 strokes.	 Now	 he judged	himself	to	be	halfway	across,	now	two-thirds.	His	pulse	quickened.	Had he	heard	a	sound?	Some	one	moving? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 question	 came	 suddenly	 into	 his	 mind.	 He	 ceased	 paddling.	 How	 should	 he come	upon	them?	In	the	canoe?	He’d	be	knocked	into	the	water,	first	pop.	Better to	land	below,	then	creep	upon	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Six	inches	of	moss	everywhere.	I’ll	make	no	sound.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	changed	his	course.	The	canoe	shot	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 beached	 his	 canoe	 among	 alder	 bushes,	 then,	 pike	 pole	 in	 hand,	 crept forward.	Holding	his	breath	he	parted	bushes	here,	crossed	a	log	there,	climbed over	 a	 moss-covered	 boulder,	 then	 paused	 to	 listen.	 No	 sound	 save	 the	 rush	 of water	against	rocky	shores.	Boo!	How	cold	it	was!	How	the	clouds	raced!	Going to	snow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Should	be	about	there,”	he	told	himself,	and	his	pulse	pounded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ten	more	steps	on	the	yielding	moss,	and	again	he	paused.	“Just	one	or	two	more trees.”	A	black	old	spruce	stood	before	him.	“Just	one	or	two,	and	then—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	what	was	that?	A	voice?	Some	one	humming	low?	Yes,	there	it	was! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	bury	me	not	on	the	lone	prairee,	where	the	coyotes	howl	ee-e—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	song	trailed	off	into	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stood	there	too	astounded	to	move.	The	voice	was	that	of	a	girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	must	be	that	girl,	Berley	Todd.	But	she—she	screamed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having	 regained	 his	 power	 of	 motion,	 he	 rounded	 the	 spruce	 tree’s	 spreading branches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	the	moon	rolled	out	from	behind	a	cloud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	 he	 saw	 held	 him	 spellbound.	 There	 stood	 the	 girl,	 her	 graceful	 figure swathed	in	dew-drenched	clothing,	her	face	scanning	the	black	waters	as	she	still</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>sang:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	bury	me	not	on	the	lone	prairee—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	gasp	of	astonishment	from	his	lips	startled	her.	She	turned	with	the	suddenness of	a	frightened	deer.	Then,	as	she	saw	his	figure	outlined	against	the	spruce	tree, she	cried:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 is	 you!	 I’m	 glad.	 I’m	 drenched	 with	 the	 dews	 of	 Heaven.	 I’m	 frozen	 to	 a statue.	Please,	let’s	hurry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	said	never	a	word.	In	response	to	her	request	he	hurried.	Five	minutes	had not	 passed	 when	 their	 canoe	 bumped	 on	 the	 other	 shore.	 They	 skirted	 the	 boat house,	rounded	a	long	low	cabin	and	at	last	reached	a	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door,	which	was	fastened,	yielded	to	Red’s	sturdy	shoulder.	Then	they	were inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh-o!”	the	girl	breathed.	“How	warm	it	seems!	As	if	there	were	a	fire.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	will	be	soon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	flashed	his	torch	about	the	room.	A	large	fireplace,	built	of	channel	rocks, was	just	before	him.	As	if	they	had	been	expected,	the	fire	was	laid,	and	a	box	of safety	matches	lay	on	the	rustic	mantel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 match	 flared,	 a	 slow	 yellow	 flame	 mounted	 higher	 and	 higher	 and	 filled	 the room	with	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh!”	the	girl	cried	suddenly.	“You	are	the	Red	Rover?	I—I’m	glad!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	what	they	call	me.”	Red	did	not	smile.	“I—I’m	sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry!	Why	are	you	sorry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry	that	you	know.	I’d	rather	be	plain	Red	Rodgers	who	works	in	a	steel	mill and	has	ambitions	of	his	own	to	become	a	foreman	or	a	steel	tester,	or	something like	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	at	him	in	a	puzzled	way.	Then	her	mood	changed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>“Do	you	know,	I	believe	you’re	wet.	See!	You	are	making	puddles	on	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	I—I’m	sort	of	dampish	myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	have	a	look	about,”	said	Red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fifteen	 minutes	 later	 they	 returned	 to	 the	 fire.	 The	 girl	 had	 garbed	 herself	 in patched	 knickers	 a	 size	 too	 large,	 and	 a	 flaming	 red	 jacket.	 Red	 wore	 a mechanic’s	coveralls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	now	he	said:	“Perhaps	you	will	tell	me	why	you	screamed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">* 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 *</p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 what	 of	 Drew	 Lane	 and	 Tom	 Howe?	 And	 who	 was	 the	 one	 who	 stood banging	on	their	door	at	dawn? </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	 will	 be	 surprised	 when	 I	 tell	 you	 it	 was	 none	 other	 than	 our	 old	 friend, Johnny	Thompson.	Johnny	was	not	in	the	habit	of	banging	on	doors	at	dawn.	At this	moment,	however,	his	business	was	urgent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	saw	the	Chief,”	he	panted.	“He	sent	me	over	hot-foot	with	a	message	for you.	 He	 says	 you	 are	 to	 get	 those	 kidnapers	 without	 delay	 and	 return	 the	 Red Rover	to	his	squad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 right?”	 Drew	 Lane	 arched	 his	 brows.	 “Didn’t	 tell	 you	 where	 we’d	 be likely	to	find	these	kidnapers,	did	he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	 did,	 and	 he	 didn’t,”	 Johnny	 replied	 shortly.	 Being	 young	 and	 only	 an amateur	detective,	he	held	the	Chief	of	Police	in	great	respect.	For	that	matter,	so did	Drew	Lane. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 Chief	 says,”	 Johnny	 went	 on	 after	 swallowing	 hard,	 “that	 ‘the	 public	 is already	 aroused.	 Why	 couldn’t	 they	 have	 snatched	 a	 senator	 or	 a	 governor instead	of	the	greatest	football	star	of	the	age?’	That’s	what	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	 wasn’t	 much	 time	 for	 saying	 anything.”	 Johnny’s	 excitement	 grew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Telephone	 jangling	 all	 the	 time.	 Newspaper	 men,	 university	 professors,	 rich graduates,	and	all	the	little	fellows	who’ve	bought	tickets	for	Soldiers’	Field	to see	 the	 Red	 Rover	 rove—all	 calling	 at	 once	 and	 demanding	 that	 something	 be done! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>“The	Chief	says	you	are	to	raid	these	places.”	He	passed	a	slip	of	paper	to	Drew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Suspected	of	kidnaping—the	gangs	that	hang	out	in	these	places.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	without	good	reason,”	Drew	grumbled.	“You’d	think—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	telephone	rang.	Drew	snatched	the	receiver.	“Sergeant	Lane	speaking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	listened	a	moment,	then:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	Chief.	Just	got	the	message.	We’ll	get	those	raids	off	at	once....	Yes,	some evidence—a	bed	sheet.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No—no	marks.	Bullet,	and	some	shavings.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Seize	all	guns,	oh,	sure!	How	about	jack-knives?... </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	 customary?	 Not	 against	 the	 rules,	 is	 it?...	 A	 pocketknife	 is	 a	 weapon?... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thought	so.	All	right,	I’ll	collect	’em.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	thought	he	heard	the	Chief	grumble	something	about	“fool	college	kids collecting	pocket	knives.”	Then	Drew	hung	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,”	Drew	drawled,	“time	for	a	cup	of	coffee	and	a	plate	of	hots;	then	we’ve got	to	get	out	and	give	the	public	a	great	thrill	by	bringing	those	kidnapers	right in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	won’t	be	as	easy	as	that,	will	it?”	Johnny	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	 by	 a	 whole	 lot!	 The	 Red	 Rover	 must	 be	 in	 his	 place	 on	 the	 gridiron	 of Soldiers’	 Field	 when	 the	 big	 game	 starts	 or	 the	 Police	 Department	 is	 forever disgraced.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	worse	than	that,”	Johnny	put	in	solemnly.	“The	Chief	says	it	means	his	job and	yours	if	we	fail.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We?	Are	you	with	us?”	Drew	looked	at	the	boy	detective	hopefully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To	 the	 bitter	 end!”	 Johny	 grinned.	 “Never	 had	 less	 of	 other	 things	 to	 do,	 and never	wanted	to	do	anything	quite	so	much	as	to	help	find	the	Red	Rover. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Think	what	it	means!”	he	enthused.	“Think	what	sort	of	fellow	the	Red	Rover</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>is.	None	of	your	rich	man’s	pampered	sons!	A	steel	mill	worker,	that’s	what	he was.	But	he’s	a	student	as	well	as	a	star.	Been	leading	his	class	in	chemistry	and math.	 Been	 working	 his	 way,	 too.	 They	 say	 Marmon,	 the	 big	 meat	 packer, offered	 to	 pay	 his	 way.	 He’s	 a	 graduate	 of	 Old	 Midway.	 But	 Red	 turned	 him down;	said	it	wasn’t	his	idea	of	good	sportsmanship,	nor	the	idea	of	the	Grand Old	Man’s.	Said	he	was	going	on	his	own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 he	 has.	 Three	 years.	 Steel	 mill	 worker	 in	 summer,	 hotel	 clerk	 in	 winter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Who	wouldn’t	hunt	for	a	chap	like	that? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never	 had	 the	 swell-head	 either.	 Always	 pushing	 the	 other	 fellows	 ahead	 of himself	 when	 he	 could.	 They	 say	 he	 has	 practically	 refused	 to	 take	 a	 play through	on	more	than	one	occasion	when	he	considered	the	game	won.	Insisted</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 the	 other	 chaps	 having	 a	 chance	 at	 a	 touchdown.	 Went	 in	 for	 interference instead	 and	 did	 double	 duty.	 Who	 wouldn’t	 want	 to	 go	 out	 and	 help	 get	 some dirty	 crook	 who’s	 snatched	 a	 chap	 like	 that?	 What	 did	 they	 want	 him	 for? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Revenge,	or	to	get	a	wad	of	filthy	greenbacks?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bravo!”	 Quiet	 Tom	 Howe	 sprang	 to	 his	 feet	 and	 clapped	 his	 hands.	 “Bravo! </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	a	grand	oration!	I	could	go	to	work	now	without	my	coffee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And,	by	George,	I	will!	Come	on	in	here,	Johnny.	I	want	you	to	help	me	try	a thing	 out.”	 Tucking	 under	 his	 arm	 the	 bed	 sheet	 he	 had	 taken	 from	 the	 Red Rover’s	car	berth,	he	disappeared	inside	his	cubby-hole	of	a	laboratory.	Johnny followed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	bring	up	a	can	of	coffee	and	some	doughnuts,”	Drew	called. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“O.	K.”	was	the	muffled	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a><b class="calibre4">CHAPTER	X</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">THE	INVISIBLE	FOOTPRINT</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	scream?”	The	girl	in	the	patched	knickers	sitting	before	the	roaring	fire	stared at	Red	Rodgers.	“Why	should	I	scream?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know.”	Red	was	puzzled.	“I	only	know	I	heard	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	did	not	scream.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	Red’s	turn	to	start.	He	had	heard	a	scream.	No	man,	even	in	mortal	agony, could	scream	in	that	manner.	What	did	it	mean?	Who—? </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	thoughts	were	broken	off	by	a	sudden	burst	of	laughter.	It	was	the	mystery girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That—that,”	 she	 stammered,	 with	 an	 effort	 at	 self	 control.	 “It	 was	 not	 I	 who screamed,	but	a	loon,	a	silly	old	loon!	Have	you	never	heard	a	loon	scream	in	the night?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	you	are	to	be	forgiven.	When	a	loon	goes	about	the	business	of	screaming in	 earnest,	 he	 can	 put	 a	 drowning	 woman	 to	 shame.	 We	 who	 have	 heard	 them often	become	so	accustomed	to	them	that	we	scarcely	hear	them	at	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	stared	first	at	the	girl,	then	at	the	fire.	He	was	wondering	in	a	vague	sort	of way	just	how	much	he	had	missed	by	living	all	his	life	within	the	confines	of	a city.	He	was	to	wonder	this	many	times	before	this	business	of	being	kidnaped and	carried	to	a	deserted	island	was	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wonder	what	that	old	loon	is	doing	here?”	the	girl	mused.	“All	his	pals	must have	gone	south	by	now.	The	gulls	stay	all	winter.	Some	kinds	of	ducks,	too,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a>the	jays	and	the	chickadees.	It	can’t	be	very	lonely	here	even	in	winter.	Wouldn’t it	be	thrilling	if	we	had	to	stay	here	on	and	on?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	stared	harder	at	the	fire	as	he	tried	in	vain	to	think	what	that	would	be	like. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	seem	to	know	a	lot	about	this	island,”	he	blurted	out	quite	suddenly.	“How does	it	happen	that	kidnapers	bring	you	to	a	place	where	you	have	been	before? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seems	a	trifle	mixed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	 wondered	 about	 that.”	 Her	 big	 blue	 eyes	 were	 round	 and	 frank.	 “I	 think I’ve	got	it	figured	out.	Do	you	believe	in	God?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why,	 yes,	 I—I	 do.	 I’ve	 prayed	 about	 football	 sometimes;	 asked	 the	 One	 who gave	me	my	body	to	help	me	keep	it	clean	and	fit;	asked	Him,	too,	to	give	me	a clear	brain	and	a	sharp	eye	for	every	play.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,”	she	breathed,	dropping	a	hand	gently	on	his	arm,	“I’m	glad!	Because	I—I believe	in	God.	I	hope	He	outwits	evil	men.	And	I—I’ve	sort	of	felt	that	He	saw that	 those	 men	 were	 going	 to	 carry	 us	 off,	 you	 and	 me,	 so	 He	 sort	 of	 winked, don’t	you	know,	like	the	man	in	the	moon	seems	to	do,	and	He	said:	‘I’ll	have those	kidnapers	take	that	boy	and	girl	to	the	island	where	the	girl	has	spent	her summers	as	long	as	she	can	remember.’	And	so,	don’t	you	see?	Here	we	are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That,”	said	Red	with	conviction,	“that’s	great!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reaching	 for	 a	 large	 spruce	 log,	 he	 threw	 it	 on	 the	 fire.	 When	 the	 shower	 of sparks	had	subsided,	he	turned	to	her	eagerly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	place	is	this?	Tell	me	about	it,	all	you	can.	We—we	may	be	parted	at	any moment.	And	I—I	need	to	know	a	lot.	In	the	end	they	may	get	us,	at	least	one	of us,	and	the	other	must	be	able	to	make	his	way	out,	in	the	end,	to	see	that	justice is	done.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	thought	of	the	kidnapers	he	strode	to	the	door	and	opened	it	a	crack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Safe	enough	for	the	present.”	His	tension	relaxed.	“It’s	snowing,	snowing	hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’ll	never	find	us	here	in	a	snowstorm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 are	 right,”	 she	 replied	 quietly.	 Her	 eyes	 closed.	 They	 remained	 closed	 so long	 that	 Red	 thought	 her	 asleep.	 But	 again	 they	 opened.	 “You	 are	 right,	 they</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a>will	not	find	us	in	the	snow.	You	should	know	about	this	place.	I	will	tell	you	all I	 can.	 And	 then—then	 we	 must	 rest,	 for	 long,	 hard	 hours	 are	 before	 us.	 It	 is difficult,	 perhaps	 impossible,	 to	 escape	 from	 this	 place	 in	 November.	 But	 we must	try.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	place	is	this?”	the	boy	asked	once	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?	 You	 don’t	 know	 our	 island?”	 The	 girl’s	 eyes	 opened	 wide.	 “This,”	 her tone	became	impressive,	“this	is	Isle	Royale!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	expects	me	to	be	greatly	surprised,”	Red	said	to	himself.	Out	of	respect	for her	desire	he	did	his	best	to	show	great	astonishment.	The	truth	was	that	the	part of	 social	 science	 that	 deals	 with	 the	 world	 we	 live	 in	 had	 interested	 him	 very little.	 He	 was	 all	 for	 chemistry,	 physics,	 mathematics.	 He	 had	 no	 more	 notion where	Isle	Royale	was	than	the	Little	Diomede	Island,	or	King	William’s	Land. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 had	 never	 heard	 of	 it.	 “But	 she	 evidently	 thinks	 it	 a	 great	 place,”	 he	 told himself,	“so	great	it	shall	be.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	me	more	about	it,”	he	demanded	at	last.	He	was	truly	interested.	If	he	was to	escape	from	this	island,	wild	and	uninhabited	as	it	appeared	to	be,	he	must	at least	know	his	way	about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">* 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 *</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	meantime,	Tom	Howe,	in	his	box-like	laboratory,	had	revealed	to	Johnny Thompson’s	 astonished	 eyes	 a	 bit	 of	 scientific	 crime	 detection	 that	 for	 sheer cunning	would	have	put	any	ancient	astrologer	or	alchemist	to	shame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having	spread	the	bed	sheet	taken	from	Red	Rodger’s	berth	out	on	a	small	table, he	 had	 switched	 on	 a	 200-watt	 lamp	 and	 had	 proceeded	 to	 examine	 it	 inch	 by inch	as	he	slid	it	across	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	a	mark,”	Johnny	commented,	as	the	examination	was	completed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 not	 so	 sure,”	 Howe	 drawled.	 “A	 man	 stepped	 on	 that	 sheet,	 a	 very	 heavy man.	 He	 left	 a	 deep	 dent	 in	 the	 mattress	 and	 bedding.	 It’s	 hard	 to	 step	 on anything	as	clean	as	a	sheet	without	leaving	some	sort	of	mark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	see.”	He	drew	the	sheet	endwise	until	the	very	center	rested	on	the	smooth top	of	the	table.	“It	would	be	about	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>He	 turned	 off	 the	 powerful	 light.	 At	 once	 the	 room	 was	 plunged	 in	 utter darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	 while	 Johnny	 waited	 as	 breathless	 as	 a	 child	 at	 his	 first	 picture	 show,	 a curious	violet	light	pervaded	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look!”	Tom	Howe	whispered,	pointing	to	the	center	of	the	sheet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	 did	 look,	 and	 there,	 to	 his	 vast	 astonishment,	 he	 beheld	 quite	 clearly outlined	the	footprint	of	a	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	sole	of	a	heavy	shoe!”	He	was	dumbfounded.	“It	was	not	there	before!	And see!	There	are	the	marks	of	the	nails;	a	heavy	workman’s	shoe.	You	could	count those	 nails.	 And	 a	 heel	 of	 some	 hard,	 prepared	 stuff	 with	 the	 maker’s	 name wrong	way	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	Howe	added	quietly,	“and	a	deep,	jagged	cut	across	the	sole.	Slipped	on some	sharp	stone	perhaps,	when	the	sole	was	wet.	That	marks	the	shoe.	It’s	not like	any	other	shoe	in	the	world.	Find	that	shoe,	find	the	man	who	wears	it,	and we	have	made	a	discovery	of	great	importance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 I	 don’t	 understand!”	 Johnny	 was	 puzzled.	 “That	 mark	 was	 not	 there	 a moment	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nor	is	it	now.”	Tom	Howe	chuckled.	The	violet	light	faded;	the	brilliant	white light	flashed	on.	The	footprint	was	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Magic!”	 Johnny	 murmured.	 “Some	 form	 of	 magic.	 You	 can’t	 convict	 a	 man with	magic.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	magic,	but	science!”	Howe’s	tone	was	impressive.	“Crooks	are	learning	to use	 science	 as	 an	 aid	 in	 committing	 crimes.	 We	 must	 use	 science	 to	 detect crimes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	 again	 the	 white	 light	 was	 gone;	 the	 violet	 light	 returned	 and	 with	 it	 that mysterious	vanishing	footprint. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 see,”	 Howe	 explained,	 “when	 that	 fellow	 entered	 the	 car	 to	 assist	 in carrying	the	famous	football	star	away,	he	had	been	walking	over	a	surface	that contained	some	chemical	 solution.	If	he	 had	passed	over	 damp	coffee	grounds, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>or	 through	 a	 forest	 where	 rank	 vegetable	 matter	 rotted,	 the	 effect	 would	 have been	as	you	see	it	now.	His	foot	would	have	left	a	mark	invisible	in	white	light, but	quite	clearly	outlined	when	subjected	to	the	rays	of	an	ultra-violet	lamp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 lamp,”	 he	 went	 on,	 “has	 detected	 the	 secret	 writing	 of	 many	 a	 spy	 and jailbird.	A	spy,	wishing	to	forward	a	secret	report,	dips	his	pen	into	a	liquid	made by	soaking	a	few	quinine	pills	in	water.	This	writing	will	not	show	in	white	light until	it	has	been	treated.	He	writes	some	commonplace	letter	over	this	message and	 sends	 it	 forth.	 Our	 Secret	 service	 men	 seize	 it,	 put	 it	 under	 the	 ultra-violet lamp,	and	there	it	is;	you	can	read	every	word.	The	moment	the	lamp	is	snapped off	the	message	is	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	criminal	may	dip	the	corner	of	his	jacket	in	coffee,	return	to	his	cell,	wring out	the	coffee	and	write	with	the	coffee	a	secret	message	to	some	one	who	plots his	deliverance.	He,	too,	may	be	caught	by	this	ultra-violet	lamp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	 now,”	 he	 concluded,	 “we	 have	 only	 to	 find	 the	 man	 who	 wears	 this	 shoe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Very	simple	in	a	city	of	three	million.”	He	smiled	a	slow	smile.	“All	the	same, it’s	a	step.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An	invisible	step,”	Johnny	chuckled. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">HOTCAKES	AT	DAWN</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 a	 person	 is	 thrown	 with	 a	 stranger	 in	 an	 empty	 land	 he	 is	 sure	 to	 learn much	of	that	other’s	ways.	It	was	so	with	Red	Rodgers.	He	was	destined	to	learn much	 regarding	 the	 true	 nature	 of	 that	 mysterious	 young	 person	 who	 called herself	 Berley	 Todd.	 One	 fact	 he	 learned	 at	 once:	 that	 she	 was	 fond	 of	 doing things	in	a	dramatic	manner.	In	her	own	mind	she	was	ever	on	the	stage.	Red	had asked	her	to	tell	of	her	beloved	Isle	Royale.	She	was	weary,	had	been	awake	all night.	She	had	been	cold	and	wet.	She	was	hungry.	Surely	this	was	no	time	for telling	of	a	place	she	loved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	cabin,”	she	recited,	“a	fireplace,	chairs,	blankets.	We	have	all	these.	And	now for	the	last	of	all—things	to	eat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lighting	 a	 candle	 that	 stood	 on	 a	 ledge	 beside	 the	 fireplace,	 she	 went	 into	 the kitchen	of	the	cabin.	Soon	she	was	calling	to	Red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Together	 they	 carried	 in	 two	 large	 tin	 boxes	 of	 what	 were	 quite	 evidently	 left-overs	of	the	party	camping	there	that	summer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Crackers,	 dried	 beans,	 oatmeal,	 a	 little	 rice.”	 The	 girl	 named	 the	 packages	 as she	 drew	 them	 forth.	 “Tea,	 coffee.	 Hurrah!	 Some	 coffee	 and	 prepared	 pancake flour.	Hotcakes	at	dawn!”	She	tossed	the	package	to	the	ceiling	and	caught	it	as it	came	down.	“What	could	be	better	than	hot	cakes	and	coffee	at	dawn?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Glancing	 toward	 the	 window,	 Red	 discovered	 that	 she	 was	 right;	 dawn	 was breaking.	But	to	his	relief	he	saw	that	snow	was	still	falling	fast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	those	fellows	get	on	our	trail,”	he	thought	with	a	shudder,	“they’ll	keep	on	it until	they	get	us.	They’ve	got	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	brewed	the	coffee.	The	girl	mixed	the	batter	and	fried	the	cakes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>The	meal	was	eaten	in	silence.	Red	found	himself	in	no	mood	for	talk;	nor	did the	girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It—it’s	like	a	communion,”	he	told	himself	with	a	gulp.	He	was	sobered	by	the thought	of	the	future	that	lay	just	before	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 know,”	 said	 the	 girl,	 as	 the	 last	 cup	 was	 drained,	 “since	 this	 thing	 had	 to happen,	I	am	glad	you	are	you.”	A	curious	smile	overspread	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank—er—thanks,”	Red	stammered.	“I’ll	do	my	best	to	be	myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 now,”	 said	 the	 girl,	 leading	 him	 to	 a	 place	 beside	 her	 on	 a	 rug	 near	 the hearth,	“I’ll	show	you	about	Isle	Royale.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragging	 a	 quantity	 of	 ashes	 out	 on	 the	 smooth	 hearth,	 she	 busied	 herself	 for some	 time	 smoothing	 them	 out,	 drawing	 her	 finger	 through	 them	 here	 and dropping	a	pinch	of	them	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,”	she	sighed	at	last,	“ashes	are	land,	bare	spaces	are	water.	See	this	little pile	 here?	 That’s	 the	 island	 we	 are	 on.	 See,	 it’s	 in	 a	 narrow	 stretch	 of	 water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	Tobin’s	Harbor.	It’s	about	three	miles	long.	See	this	one	over	to	the	right? </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	 Rock	 Harbor.	 It’s	 much	 longer.	 Off	 to	 the	 left	 of	 Tobin’s	 Harbor	 is Duncan’s	Bay.	It	may	not	matter.	And	it	may.	You	can’t	tell	where	we’ll	end	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See	that	bit	of	a	pile	here?	That’s	Passage	Island.	There’s	a	lighthouse	out	there with	people	in	it,	a	big	light	and	a	foghorn.	Listen,	you	can	hear	that	horn	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	listened	and	to	his	waiting	ears	came	the	distant	hoot	of	a	giant	foghorn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	simple	it	all	is!”	He	heaved	a	sigh	of	relief.	“All	we	have	to	do	is	to	get out	to	the	lighthouse	before	those	fellows	catch	up	to	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	 she	 sighed,	 “that’s	 all.	 But	 it’s	 four	 miles	 out	 there.	 This	 is	 the	 stormy season	 of	 the	 year.	 We	 have	 only	 a	 rowboat.	 And	 remember	 this—”	 Her	 tone was	as	solemn	as	a	parson’s	at	a	funeral.	“Remember	this:	‘Superior	never	gives up	her	dead!’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	all	that	water	you’ve	left	there	Lake	Superior?”	Red	was	truly	impressed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 and	 a	 great	 deal	 more.	 Miles	 and	 miles	 and	 miles.	 Isle	 Royale	 is	 nearer</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a>Canada	than	the	United	States.	It	is	not	near	enough	to	any	place	to	do	us	much good	in	November.	The	lighthouse	is	our	hope.	But	after	the	snow	it	will	blow.	I am	almost	sure	of	that.	So,	you	see,	that	which	was	begun	to-night	may	not	be finished	at	once,	my	friend	the	Red	Rover. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	now—”	Her	eyes	closed	for	a	moment.	“Now	I	would	be	glad	to	tell	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	my	island	home.	I	love	it	as	I	do	no	other	home.	If	danger	did	not	threaten,	I should	dearly	love	to	remain	here,	even	now	when	everyone	is	gone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everyone?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	may	be	fishermen	staying	at	the	other	end	of	the	island.	But	that	is	forty-five	miles	away.	Forty-five	miles	of	wilderness,	do	you	understand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	understand,”	said	Red	Rodgers.	A	new	note	had	crept	into	his	voice.	He	was beginning	to	sense	the	brave	part	this	girl	was	playing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	now	you	must	rest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	set	about	preparing	a	place	for	her	on	a	broad	seat	before	the	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you—”	she	protested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I’ll	sleep	with	one	eye	open,	here	in	a	chair.	As	long	as	snow	continues	to fall,	we	are	safe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	when	the	sky	clears	you	will	call	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never	fear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“While	I	sleep	I	will	dream	what	we	are	to	do	next.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Success	to	your	dreams.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning	 his	 back	 on	 her,	 Red	 busied	 himself	 by	 drawing	 a	 crude	 map	 of	 the island	modeled	after	her	relief	map	of	ashes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Going	 to	 be	 tough,”	 he	 whispered	 with	 a	 sigh.	 “Tough	 for	 both	 of	 us.	 But somehow	we’ll	make	it.	We’ve	got	to!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 another	 look	 at	 the	 falling	 snow,	 he	 curled	 up	 for	 three	 winks.	 He	 slept</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>them	 through,	 all	 unconscious	 of	 the	 commotion	 his	 disappearance	 had	 stirred up.	The	hundreds	of	columns	printed	about	him	in	the	papers	all	over	the	land, the	 scores	 of	 detectives	 on	 the	 trail	 of	 the	 kidnapers,	 the	 thousands	 of	 earnest persons	in	all	walks	of	life	who	had	volunteered	to	do	all	in	their	power	to	help bring	 him	 back—all	 this	 he	 would	 have	 found,	 had	 he	 known	 it,	 a	 matter	 for surprise	 and	 great	 bewilderment.	 For	 the	 Red	 Rover	 was,	 above	 all,	 a	 very humble	and	modest	young	man	who	loved	doing	things	for	their	own	sake,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">who	thought	little	of	honor	or	great	reward.	That	the	world	at	large	had	been	so greatly	stirred	by	his	disappearance	he	did	not	dream. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a><b class="calibre4">CHAPTER	XII</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">JOHNNY	GETS	A	“JIMMY” </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">That	day	Johnny	Thompson,	in	quite	an	accidental	manner,	came	into	possession of	certain	facts	that,	while	increasing	his	perplexity	at	the	time,	were	destined	in the	end	to	go	far	toward	solving	a	great	mystery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These	facts	were	discovered	as	he	went	about	the	business	of	purchasing	a	large bouquet	of	chrysanthemums.	No,	Johnny	had	not	gone	soft.	He	was	not	buying</p>
<p class="calibre1">flowers	 for	 a	 cigar	 clerk	 nor	 a	 telephone	 operator.	 Far	 from	 that.	 There	 was	 a school	 for	 crippled	 children	 just	 around	 the	 corner	 from	 his	 lodging.	 He	 had come	 to	 know	 many	 of	 these	 children.	 They	 loved	 flowers,	 as	 all	 right-minded children	 do.	 He	 was	 sending	 them	 a	 bouquet.	 Drew	 Lane	 and	 Tom	 Howe	 had gone	about	the	business	of	conducting	a	raid	which,	they	assured	him,	would	be quite	a	tame	affair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ll	 be	 expecting	 us,”	 Drew	 grinned.	 “There’s	 never	 a	 big	 bank	 robbery pulled	but	next	day	all	the	successful	bank	robbers	are	called	on	by	the	police. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	the	same	with	kidnapers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you	know	they’re	bank	robbers	or	kidnapers,	why	don’t	you	just	send	them down	to	State’s	Prison	and	have	it	over	with?”	Johnny	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 would	 be	 neat	 and	 quite	 simple.”	 Drew	 smiled	 a	 broad	 smile.	 “But	 the Constitution	 grants	 every	 man	 a	 trial.	 You’ve	 got	 to	 prove	 what	 down	 deep	 in your	heart	you	know,	so	you	have	to	go	out	and	get	the	facts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	we’ll	get	some	facts	to-day,	whether	they	realize	it	or	not,”	Tom	Howe	put in.	“Drew’s	going	to	collect	a	gallon	of	pocket	knives.	That’s	something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	may	be	a	lot,”	said	Drew	soberly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	 Johnny	 went	 to	 the	 shop	 at	 the	 foot	 of	 the	 river	 bridge	 to	 buy	 flowers.	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>liked	 this	 shop	 and	 its	 dark-skinned	 proprietor.	 The	 man’s	 name	 was	 Angelo Piccalo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	Johnny!”	Piccalo	welcomed	him.	“Some	flowers	to-day?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	Big	yellow	ones	for	the	kids—crippled	kids.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Crippled	keeds.”	The	flower	merchant	grinned	a	broad	grin.	“The	biggest,	the ver’	best!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 flowers	 had	 been	 boxed	 and	 paid	 for,	 the	 proprietor	 stood	 in	 his	 doorway bidding	 Johnny	 good-bye,	 when	 a	 motor	 horn	 sounded	 close	 at	 hand.	 Johnny started.	He	believed	it	a	car.	To	his	surprise,	though	he	looked	up	and	down	the street,	there	was	no	car	near	enough	to	have	produced	that	sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Speed	boat.”	Angelo	Piccalo	grinned	once	more.	“My	boy.	Name	Angelo.	See! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fine	boy,	that	one.	No	cripple	heem!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 boy	 who	 grinned	 up	 at	 them	 from	 the	 river	 was	 surely	 no	 cripple.	 Some eighteen	years	of	age,	he	was	the	picture	of	perfect	youth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	 to	 college	 next	 year,”	 Piccalo	 confided.	 “Beeg	 gentleman	 some	 time,	 my boy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	will	never	know	why	he	went	down	the	iron	steps	that	led	to	the	landing place	 where	 the	 speed	 boat	 rested.	 There	 were	 times	 when	 he	 almost	 regretted having	done	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	Angelo!”	he	greeted.	“That’s	a	fine	boat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	 so	 bad.”	 The	 younger	 Angelo’s	 eyes	 took	 him	 in	 at	 a	 glance.	 “Not	 much speed.	Trade	it	in	for	a	better	one	soon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	flower	business	must	pay	very	well,”	Johnny	told	himself.	“Bet	he’s	got	a car,	a	fast	one.	Going	to	college,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Angelo	 had	 bent	 over	 to	 lift	 up	 the	 rear	 seat	 of	 his	 boat.	 He	 was	 looking	 for something.	 Plainly	 it	 was	 not	 there.	 Another	 object	 was	 there	 that	 apparently annoyed	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a>“Who’s	been	making	my	boat	into	a	junk	wagon?”	He	lifted	out	a	bent	iron	bar and	was	about	to	drop	it	in	the	river,	when	Johnny	stopped	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey!	Don’t	do	that!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	not?	You	want	it?	All	right.	Here	it	is.”	The	boy	tossed	the	bar	to	Johnny’s feet.	It	fell	with	a	noisy	jangle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thinking	 he	 had	 caught	 some	 sound	 from	 above,	 Johnny	 looked	 up	 in	 time	 to surprise	a	black	look	on	the	older	Piccalo’s	usually	smiling	face.	One	moment	it was	there.	The	next	it	was	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Strange!”	 Johnny	 thought.	 “I	 must	 have	 been	 mistaken.”	 Yet	 he	 knew	 he	 had not	been,	and	found	himself	disturbed	by	that	insistent	question,	“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	a	curious	band	you	have	for	your	wrist	watch,”	he	said	to	the	boy	in	the speed	boat.	“All	green.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Made	 of	 green	 stones,”	 Angelo	 explained.	 “Got	 ’em	 on	 Isle	 Royale	 last summer.	 Fine	 place,	 Isle	 Royale.	 Plenty	 big	 fish,	 wild	 moose.	 Plenty	 pretty girls.”	He	grinned	broadly.	“Found	these	stones	on	the	beach	up	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	 picked	 up	 the	 iron	 bar,	 climbed	 the	 stairs	 and	 walked	 away.	 This	 bar might	 at	 one	 time	 have	 been	 used	 by	 a	 merchant	 for	 opening	 boxes	 and	 at another	 by	 some	 gentleman	 of	 evil	 intentions	 in	 opening	 the	 window	 of	 some other	person’s	home.	It	is,	I	believe,	known	in	some	circles	as	a	“jimmy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feeling	a	little	foolish	walking	down	the	street,	he	wondered	why	he	had	saved the	bar	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hate	to	see	the	work	of	some	man’s	hands	wasted,”	he	told	himself.	“Many	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">poor	shopkeeper	on	Maxwell	Street	would	be	glad	to	own	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	that	he	wrapped	it	in	his	morning	paper	and	at	last	deposited	it	in	back	of	a small	 desk	 in	 Drew	 Lane’s	 room.	 There	 it	 was	 to	 remain	 until	 the	 time appointed.	 Then	 it	 was	 to	 offer	 its	 bit	 of	 evidence	 regarding	 certain	 dark	 deeds committed	on	a	night	in	November	of	that	same	year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">* 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 *</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p70"></a>The	 snow	 that	 had	 fallen	 steadily	 since	 the	 hour	 before	 dawn	 upon	 that	 tiny island	in	Tobin’s	Harbor	of	Isle	Royale	ceased	at	ten	o’clock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Standing	before	the	window,	Red	Rodgers	watched	a	scene	of	matchless	beauty</p>
<p class="calibre1">unfold	before	him.	Dark,	unruffled	waters	widened	moment	by	moment	until	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">last	trees,	great	dark	giant	spruce	and	slender	ghosts	of	birches,	began	appearing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	at	last	the	snow	fog	had	vanished	altogether	he	saw	on	the	not-too-distant shore	spruce	and	balsam	standing	like	rows	of	tall	tents	of	the	Indians. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	even	as	he	stood	there	some	dark	object	moved	amongst	the	birch	trees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	moose!”	he	exclaimed	under	his	breath.	Then	again	he	wondered	that	the	girl had	shown	no	fear	at	their	encounter	with	an	antlered	monarch	back	there	on	the trail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Life,”	 he	 told	 himself,	 as	 he	 watched	 the	 great	 sleek	 creature	 on	 the	 opposite shore	step	out	to	stand	ankle	deep	in	water,	head	high,	antlers	gleaming,	“Life	is strange!	Here	I	have	lived	all	my	life	in	a	city.	Never	would	have	known	of	this other	world	but	for	the	work	of	these	outlaws	who	carried	me	away.	And	now—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	paused.	Well,	what	of	now?	He	could	form	no	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	about	to	look	long	and	steadily	at	the	sleeping	girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes,	 life	 surely	 was	 strange.	 Nothing	 like	 this	 had	 come	 to	 him	 before.	 As	 he looked	at	the	perfect	repose	of	that	face,	something	welled	up	within	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	 trusts	 me,”	 he	 whispered.	 Until	 this	 moment	 he	 had	 not	 known	 that	 such perfect	trust	existed	in	the	world.	“She	trusts	me.	She	believes	in	me.	Her	father may	be	rich.	That	does	not	matter.	I	will	neither	desert	nor	betray	her.	We	shall fight	it	out	together,	to	the	bitter	end.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	this	serious-minded	boy	who	until	this	moment	had	known	little	of	life	as	it	is lived	 save	 on	 the	 gridiron	 and	 in	 the	 steel	 mills,	 this	 was	 a	 solemn	 covenant never	to	be	broken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	now,”	he	asked	himself,	“what	is	to	be	done	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 problem	 he	 thought	 through	 with	 care.	 “They’re	 likely	 to	 be	 looking	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>us,”	 he	 told	 himself.	 “Yes,	 their	 search	 will	 be	 rather	 a	 wild	 one,	 when	 they know.”	 He	 put	 a	 hand	 to	 his	 pocket.	 Then	 his	 face	 sobered.	 Had	 he	 made	 a mistake? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	only	we	can	make	a	clean	get-away	they	are	sunk!”	he	muttered,	clenching his	fists.	“I	am	not	sorry	I	took	the	chance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	 again	 his	 thoughts	 returned	 to	 the	 problem	 at	 hand.	 “A	 step	 in	 the	 snow will	betray	us,”	he	told	himself.	“Now	the	unmarked	snow	says	we	are	not	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Better	to	wait	for	darkness.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having	come	to	this	conclusion,	he	sank	deep	in	his	chair	and	fell	fast	asleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	awoke	some	hours	later	to	be	greeted	by	the	faint	aroma	of	tea	brewing	and biscuits	baking	on	the	hearth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 dark	 now,”	 a	 voice	 whispered	 in	 his	 ear.	 “We	 must	 be	 moving	 soon.	 But first	we	must	eat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	 ate	 that	 meal	 in	 silence.	 He	 was	 thinking	 hard.	 “The	 game	 for	 to-day	 is over,”	 he	 told	 himself.	 “We	 have	 won.	 No	 radio	 must	 tell	 me	 that.	 They	 didn’t need	me	to-day.	Probably	the	Grand	Old	Man	would	not	have	put	me	in	to-day	at all;	save	me	for	Saturday’s	game.	He	said	I	was	getting	slow	on	my	feet.	Well, probably	I	was.	Tired,	that’s	what	I	was.	Football	takes	it	out	of	a	fellow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Saving	me.”	He	grinned	in	spite	of	himself.	“I	was	saved	all	right;	put	away	for the	winter,	like	as	not;	pickled	like	a	cucumber	in	a	jar.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	really	thinking	what	he	was	doing,	he	rose	and	began	pacing	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Worried?”	The	girl	smiled	up	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep,	quite	a	little.	About	Saturday’s	game.”	He	dropped	into	a	chair.	“You	see, our	coach,	the	Grand	Old	Man,	we	call	him,	is	getting	along	in	years.	This	may be	his	last	season.	Who	knows?	It’s	almost	sure	to	be	his	last	winning	team.	Five of	our	best	men	graduate	this	year.	Breaks	up	the	line.	And,	well,	you	know,	the coach	is	such	a	square	shooter,	he’s	so	human	and	kind,	seems	to	love	his	boys so,	that	you	just	naturally	want	to	do	things	for	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I	know,”	said	the	girl	quietly.	“And	I	know	the	success	of	the	team	depends</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a>on	 you,	 Red	 Rover.	 Read	 all	 about	 it	 in	 the	 papers.	 You’re	 going	 to	 play	 on Saturday.	And	I’ll	be	cheering	on	the	side	lines.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	flashed	her	a	grateful	smile.	“That’s	right,	keep	on	kidding	me.	It	all	helps.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	kidding.	We	will	get	away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	tell	me	more	about	this	island.	Well,	no,	perhaps	we	had	better	be	on	our way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rising,	 they	 went	 to	 the	 window.	 A	 large	 silver	 moon	 was	 tipping	 every	 wave with	a	point	of	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	can’t	go	to	the	lighthouse	to-night.”	There	was	a	note	of	finality	in	the	girl’s voice.	“The	waves	out	there	are	as	high	as	a	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	we’d	better	not	venture	out	just	now,	either.	The	moon’s	too	bright.	In	an hour	or	two	there	may	be	clouds.	See,	they	are	coming	in	from	the	north.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	where	shall	we	go	when	the	clouds	are	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Home.”	The	girl	whispered	the	word	softly.	“To	my	island	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a><b class="calibre4">CHAPTER	XIII</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">LIGHT	ON	THE	WATER</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	 island	 home,”	 the	 girl	 said	 musingly.	 “How	 can	 I	 tell	 you	 about	 it	 so	 that you	will	love	it	as	I	do? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	Isle	Royale.”	She	spread	her	arms	wide	as	if	to	gather	its	miles	of	wide expanse	into	one	embrace.	“Beautiful	bays	and	tiny	lakes	where	the	loon	and	the wild	duck	come	to	build	their	nests. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	 hundred	 enchanted	 islands	 where	 gulls	 soar	 and	 scream	 at	 sundown,	 where the	sea	hawk	soars	above	you	to	complain	in	his	shrill	voice	of	your	intrusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Deep	 dark	 pools	 beside	 the	 shelving	 rocks	 where	 black	 shadows	 play	 and spotted	trout	dart	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	Isle	Royale.”	Her	eyes	were	dreamy	as	she	stared	at	the	fire,	that	petite, vivacious	little	lady,	Berley	Todd.	“This	is	the	place	where	I	have	always	played my	summer	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	to	think—”	Her	tone	changed.	“To	think	that	those	men	might	have	killed me.	Then	I	would	have	played	no	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To	think,”	she	mused,	“never	again	to	feel	the	lift	of	my	boat	as	I	danced	along in	 Tobin’s	 Harbor	 or	 out	 on	 the	 open	 lake.	 Never	 again	 to	 skim	 along	 before	 a gentle	 gale.	 Never	 to	 climb	 the	 low	 mountains	 and	 look	 away,	 away,	 away	 to where	the	blue	begins! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 know,”	 her	 tone	 became	 confidential,	 “we	 were	 always	 children	 on	 this island.	 Sometimes	 we’d	 take	 blankets	 and	 a	 grub	 box,	 boys	 and	 girls	 together, four,	six,	ten,	a	dozen	of	us,	and	tramp	away	to	the	top	of	Mount	Franklin.	There, beside	a	fire	on	the	rocks,	we	watched	the	twilight	fade	and	counted	the	stars	as they	came	out	one	by	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a>“Then,	 rolling	 up	 in	 our	 blankets,	 we	 slept	 beneath	 those	 stars.	 Playing	 all summer	long.	Don’t	you	love	to	play?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	said	Red	slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you	have	played!	Football.	You	play	football.	That’s	a	game.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	it?”	He	smiled	a	curious	smile.	“Well,	perhaps.	But	it’s	work,	too,	if	you	win. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	have	to	keep	everlastingly	at	it.	And	the	thing	you	keep	everlastingly	at	is pretty	sure	to	seem	like	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Play,”	he	mused,	“play	all	summer.	Play	all	winter	would	be	good	enough	for me.”	 Football	 had	 taken	 its	 toll	 of	 his	 young	 life.	 He	 was	 weary,	 desperately weary;	 not	 the	 weariness	 that	 comes	 from	 a	 day	 of	 sudden,	 arduous	 toil,	 to	 be dispelled	by	a	night’s	repose,	but	the	dull,	dragged-out	weariness	experienced	by an	Arctic	dog	team	after	a	five	hundred	mile	trek	over	the	frozen	snow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	me,”	the	girl	demanded	suddenly,	“what	do	you	like?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 do	 I	 like?”	 Red	 spoke	 slowly.	 “I	 can’t	 tell	 you	 that.	 I	 can	 only	 tell	 you what	I	have	liked	in	the	past.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	me.”	She	laid	her	hand	on	his	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This,”	he	said	slowly,	as	if	recalling	some	scene	in	the	remote	past,	“this	is	what I	have	liked:	to	stand	before	an	open	hearth	in	the	steel	mill	where	twenty	tons	of scrap-iron,	together	with	limestone	and	tungsten,	boil	at	white	heat;	to	reach	in	a long	ladle	and	sample	it	as	the	New	England	farmer	samples	his	maple	syrup;	to watch	the	sample	cool,	to	crack	it	with	a	hammer,	to	study	its	gleam;	to	do	this again	and	again	until	at	last	you	make	a	motion	that	says,	‘The	batch	is	done.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	 to	 throw	 a	 lever	 and	 watch	 that	 white	 hot	 metal,	 twenty	 tons	 of	 it,	 pour into	a	massive	brick-lined	pot	of	steel	that	hangs	suspended	from	a	crane. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then—”	He	paused	to	take	a	long	breath.	The	girl	was	staring	at	him	with	all her	eyes.	“Then	to	stand	beneath	that	twenty	tons	of	molten	steel	and	make	the gesture	 that	 sets	 flat	 cars	 in	 motion,	 flat	 cars	 loaded	 with	 forms	 to	 receive	 the steel.	Then	to	watch	the	white	hot	steel	pour	once	more;	to	follow	its	course	until the	forms	have	been	lifted	off	and	the	billets	of	steel	stand,	red	hot,	sizzling	in the	snow,	row	on	row.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a>He	looked	at	her	as	if	uncertain	whether	or	not	to	go	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes—yes.	Please?”	whispered	Berley	Todd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To	climb	a	steel	stairway—”	He	took	a	fresh	start.	“To	seize	a	lever	that	swings a	 crane.	 To	 lift	 a	 red	 hot	 billet	 of	 steel	 into	 its	 place	 before	 heavy	 steel	 rollers, then	to	lift	it	and	toss	it,	to	turn	it	and	bump	it,	to	roll	it	here	and	roll	it	there,	to press	it	and	cut	it,	then	slide	it	to	one	side,	a	long,	perfect	steel	rail	over	which rich	 and	 poor,	 presidents	 and	 princes	 may	 ride	 in	 safety.	 That,”	 he	 ended,	 “has seemed	to	me	a	very	large	sample	of	life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh!”	she	breathed.	And	again,	“Oh!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	said	never	a	word.	For	all	that,	he	sensed	the	fact	that	she	had	grasped	the meaning	of	all	this	and	was	glad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll	go	back	to	that,”	she	said	after	a	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	studies	and	football	are	things	of	the	past.	I	hope	so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you’ll	learn	to	love	my	island	just	a	little,	won’t	you?	And	you	will	come back	here	when	summer	has	come	and	the	loons	are	nesting	in	Tobin’s	Harbor?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	pleading	in	her	voice.	She	loved	Isle	Royale.	How	could	others	fail	to love	it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	feel,”	said	Red	with	a	curious	smile,	“I	sort	of	feel	that	I	will	come,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	look!”	He	sprang	to	his	feet.	“The	clouds	are	here.	The	moon	has	vanished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Time	to	be	going!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	did	not	now	say:	“Where	shall	we	go?”	He	knew	they	were	to	row	up	the	bay half	a	mile,	then	climb	over	a	ridge	to	her	family’s	summer	home.	He	was	more than	 eager	 to	 reach	 that	 home.	 Curiosity	 regarding	 that	 home	 entered	 into	 that desire.	 But	 more	 than	 that	 was	 the	 feeling	 that	 there	 she	 would	 know	 of	 many places	of	hiding.	And	hide	they	must	until	they	could	leave	the	island. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	bring	the	boat	around.”	He	vanished	into	the	outer	darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Closing	 the	 door	 softly	 behind	 her,	 Berley	 Todd	 stepped	 out	 upon	 the	 short platform	which	served	both	as	doorstep	and	dock.	What	emotion	surged	through</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>her	being	as	she	stood	alone	there	in	the	dark?	Only	she	could	answer	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon	came	the	low	dip-dip	of	oars,	and	they	were	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’d	 better	 cross	 straight	 over,”	 she	 said	 in	 a	 low	 tone.	 “Then	 we	 can	 follow the	shore.	We’ll	come	at	last	to	a	small	landing.	Better	try	to	keep	in	the	shadows if	the	moon	comes	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	this	was	wise	counsel	he	was	soon	enough	to	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	as	they	reached	the	opposite	shore	the	moon,	breaking	through	the	clouds, painted	the	channel	with	a	million	spangles	of	silver. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Swinging	the	boat	about	quickly,	Red	drew	it	into	the	shadow	of	an	overhanging cedar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Resting	 there	 for	 a	 moment,	 they	 allowed	 their	 eyes	 to	 wander	 back.	 There, lighted	up	by	the	silver	moon	was	the	cabin	that	had	offered	them	sanctuary	for	a day.	Would	they	ever	forget	it?	How	could	they? </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 who	 would	 wish	 to	 forget	 so	 lovely	 a	 picture?	 Great	 spruce	 trees	 towered toward	the	sky.	Half	hidden	by	the	lesser	growth	of	birch	and	balsam,	the	cabins stood.	There	were	three	in	all,	yet	in	this	uncertain	light	they	seemed	but	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	one	of	the	loveliest	spots	on	earth!”	The	girl	took	one	long	deep	breath	that came	near	being	a	sob.	“It	is	so	beautiful	it	seems	like	a	dream.	Like	a	southern home	beside	a	river	in	a	moving	picture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	man	built	it	years	ago.	He	built	into	it	all	his	love	for	nature	and	the	great	out-of-doors.	He	had	planned	it	that	those	he	loved	might	be	happy	there.	And	they have	been	very,	very	happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wouldn’t	 this	 world	 be	 wonderful	 if	 all	 men	 were	 like	 that?	 If	 we	 lived	 for others	more	than	for	ourselves?	If	no	one	were	greedy	or	ambitious	for	power?	If we	all	lived	the	life	God	has	given	us	for	the	pure	joy	of	living?”	Then	again	she murmured,	“It’s	like	some	southern	home.”	Her	voice	trailed	off	into	silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	after	a	moment,	she	began	again,	only	this	time	she	was	singing,	singing so	softly	that	she	would	not	waken	a	sleeping	bird:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a>“Carry	me	back	to	old	Virginia, </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	place	where	I	was	born.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then,	as	if	the	island	home	were	but	a	beautiful	dream,	the	moonlight	faded, leaving	all	in	darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	again	Red	Rodgers	took	up	the	oars	and	they	glided	onward	over	the	dark mysterious	waters	of	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	strange,	this	passing	on	and	on	into	the	unknown.	Water	and	air	seemed	to meet.	Did	they	ride	in	air	or	on	water?	What	could	it	matter? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only	 the	 rough	 outline	 of	 tree	 tops	 served	 to	 guide	 him.	 Off	 to	 the	 right	 a	 tiny island	loomed	for	a	time,	then	faded	into	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	them	some	wild	creature	swam.	Was	it	duck	or	beaver?	Who	could	say? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing	appeared	to	matter.	All	was	swallowed	up	in	the	mystery	of	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	by	a	sudden	flash	of	light,	all	was	changed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There!”	the	girl	whispered.	“There,	to	the	left,	is	the	dock!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	moment	more	and	they	glided	silently	alongside	the	narrow	platform. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tie	up	here.”	The	girl	stepped	from	the	boat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Until	 this	 time	 they	 had	 not	 flashed	 a	 light.	 Why	 did	 the	 girl	 flash	 Red’s	 light now?	Who	can	say?	She	did	throw	it	on	for	a	second.	Instantly	a	low	cry	escaped her	lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look!	Footprints!”	Dismay	was	registered	in	her	tone.	“They—they	have	gone</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	us!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	true	that	the	narrow	circle	of	light	revealed	the	prints	of	a	very	large	boot in	the	snow.	To	the	right	of	the	dock	a	boat	was	tied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girl	snapped	off	the	light.	For	a	moment	they	stood	there	in	silence	side	by side,	a	moment	only,	then	the	girl	gripped	Red’s	arm	until	it	hurt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look!	Look!	Light	on	the	water!	They	are	behind	us	and	before!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a>Some	distance	away,	on	the	black	surface	of	the	water	a	pale	light	shone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come!”	 she	 whispered.	 “I	 know	 a	 hundred	 hiding	 places!	 We	 can	 best	 escape them	here!”	She	led	him	to	the	foot	of	the	hill,	then	began	to	climb,	leaving	him to	follow	in	the	dark	as	best	he	could. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">DREW	LANE	STEPS	INTO	SOMETHING</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">That	same	night	Drew	Lane	“stepped	into	something,”	something	that	was	quite unexpected	and—well,	you’ll	see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During	the	day	he	had	conducted	his	raids	on	the	city’s	two	“kidnaping	centers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	had	turned	out	as	he	had	prophesied	they	might—quite	tame	affairs.	Most of	the	gentlemen,	expecting	a	call,	had	stepped	out.	The	raids	yielded	three	guns, sixteen	 pocket	 knives	 and	 no	 information	 of	 importance	 regarding	 the mysterious	 disappearance	 of	 the	 Red	 Rover.	 Indeed	 the	 protestations	 of innocence,	the	ready	offer	of	assistance	which	he	received	on	every	hand	led	him to	 believe	 that	 this	 was	 a	 job	 pulled	 off	 by	 some	 one	 quite	 outside	 the	 well-ordered	circle	of	kidnaping	gentlemen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Honest,	Lane,	we	don’t	know	a	thing!”	one	smooth-spoken	gentleman	assured</p>
<p class="calibre1">him.	“We	don’t	want	the	Red	Rover	snatched.	Why	should	we?	Our	money	is	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 him,	 a	 lot	 of	 it.	 We	 want	 him	 to	 come	 through	 with	 a	 touchdown,	 a	 whole flock	of	’em.	Tell	you	what—”	His	voice	dropped	to	a	whisper.	“Your	pay	isn’t too	big.	Know	where	you	can	pick	up	a	piece	of	change?	I	do.	You	just	step	out and	bring	the	Red	Rover	back.	The	boys	here	will	make	up	a	purse	for	you.	Just you	say:	‘The	Red	Rover	plays,’	and	you’ll	hear	the	clink	of	gold.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	men	gamble	on	football?”	Drew	had	opened	his	eyes	wide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	they?	Why,	say!	They—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 something—a	 wink,	 a	 thrust	 in	 the	 side,	 a	 dark	 look,	 something—silenced the	talkative	one.	He	said	no	more.	He	had	said	enough,	however,	to	put	Drew	in a	thoughtful	mood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	collecting	of	pocket	knives	was	received	on	the	whole	as	a	huge	joke.	It	was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>suggested	that	he	go	out	on	a	sand	lot	and	take	up	a	jack-knife	collection	from the	boys	playing	ball. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drew	felt	a	bit	silly	about	it	himself	and,	since	he	had	no	notion	what	purpose	it was	 intended	 to	 serve,	 he	 was	 tempted	 to	 chuck	 it.	 In	 the	 end	 he	 carried	 it through.	So	sixteen	pocket	knives	all	duly	labeled	reposed	in	the	drawer	of	his desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	of	which	has	nothing	whatever	to	do	with	the	thing	he	“stepped	into”	after darkness	had	fallen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 had	 gone	 into	 a	 place	 for	 a	 belated	 dinner.	 This	 place,	 he	 knew,	 had	 a	 bad reputation.	 That	 was	 why	 he	 wished	 to	 eat	 there.	 A	 born	 detective,	 Drew	 was always	looking	for	things,	and	sometimes	he	found	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having	ordered	baked	flank	steak,	French	fried	potatoes,	pie,	and	black	coffee, he	sat	back	in	his	chair	to	stare	dreamily	about	him.	He	was	truly	hungry.	“Flank steak	 all	 filled	 with	 dressing!	 Um!”	 he	 whispered.	 Little	 did	 he	 dream	 that	 the meal	would	never	be	eaten. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	before	him	eight	men	were	grouped	around	a	double	table.	Their	meal	over, they	sat	drinking	amber	liquid	from	tall	glasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Might	 be	 soda	 water,”	 Drew	 mused.	 The	 men	 were	 far	 more	 interesting	 than their	 drink.	 They	 were	 a	 strange	 lot.	 Three	 of	 them,	 dark	 complexioned gentlemen	with	short	black	moustaches,	looked	exactly	alike.	They	were	dressed alike	 and	 often	 all	 spoke	 at	 the	 same	 time.	 They	 laughed	 together	 in	 a	 sort	 of symphonic	 chorus.	 To	 the	 right	 of	 these	 was	 a	 large	 man	 with	 a	 huge	 red	 nose who	roared	when	he	laughed.	A	smaller	and	younger	man,	who	might	well	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	his	son,	sat	beside	him.	Across	from	these	were	two	others	who	did	not	fall under	Drew’s	gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	at	the	end	caught	and	held	Drew’s	attention.	A	small	man,	he	said	never a	word,	but	all	the	time	sat	poised	as	if	for	a	spring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks	like	a	jack-in-the-box,”	Drew	told	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	little	man’s	eyes	were	roving	from	one	to	another	of	his	companions.	Once, these	 eyes,	 swinging	 in	 a	 wide	 circle,	 took	 Drew	 in.	 Cold	 steel-gray	 eyes	 that glittered,	they	sent	a	chill	coursing	down	his	spine.	He	felt	in	his	pocket.	Yes,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>safety	on	his	automatic	was	snapped	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	then	that	Drew’s	keen	mind	registered	an	important	fact.	This	little	man with	the	fiery	eyes	was	branded,	or	so	it	seemed;	there	was	a	double	scar	on	the right	side	of	his	forehead.	Together	these	scars,	one	red,	the	other	purple,	formed a	Maltese	Cross. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Know	 him	 anywhere,”	 Drew	 told	 himself.	 “And	 yet,	 those	 scars	 might	 be faked,	little	touches	of	colored	wax.	It’s	been	done.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drew	 was	 expecting	 something	 to	 happen.	 The	 room	 was	 like	 a	 country	 place before	a	thunderstorm.	One	expects	the	roar	of	it	long	before	the	first	peal	comes rolling	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 the	 thing	 did	 happen	 Drew	 was	 ready.	 It	 was	 nothing	 much	 at	 that,	 you might	 say.	 The	 little	 man	 half	 rose	 in	 his	 chair.	 As	 he	 did	 so	 something	 heavy slipped	from	his	pocket	and	fell	to	the	floor	with	a	crash.	It	was	a	blue-barreled automatic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	so	much	as	glancing	about,	the	little	man	reached	down	to	pick	it	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	look	of	pained	surprise	overspread	his	face	as	he	realized	the	gun	was	not	on the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	 as	 if	 a	 thought	 had	 struck	 him	 all	 of	 a	 heap,	 he	 whirled	 about	 to	 fix	 his fiery	eyes	on	Drew	Lane	and	to	remark	in	a	tone	as	smooth	and	hard	as	glass:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	got	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure	did.”	Sliding	back	his	chair,	Drew	stood	up,	thrust	both	hands	deep	in	his pockets,	then	with	a	trick	he	had	learned	by	long	practice,	threw	out	the	lapel	of his	coat	to	display	his	star	pinned	underneath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	said	never	another	word—just	stood	there	smiling	a	little.	What	more	was	to be	said?	The	man	had	carried	concealed	weapons.	This	he	had	no	right	to	do.	As an	officer	Drew	was	doing	his	duty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	little	man’s	face	went	red	all	over,	like	an	angry	sunset.	His	eyes	swept	the circle	of	his	companions	and,	as	if	attached	to	strings	held	in	his	hand,	they	arose</p>
<p class="calibre1">—the	three	all	alike,	the	big	man,	his	son	and	the	other	two. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a>Drew	Lane	was	young.	But	he	was	no	novice.	He	knew	what	it	meant.	He	was prepared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gentlemen,”	he	spoke	in	an	even	tone,	“you	can	take	me.	You	are	eight	to	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I’ll	get	two	of	you	first.”	His	eyes	fell	a	trifle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	not	a	man	in	the	group	but	read	his	meaning.	In	his	pockets	were	two automatics.	 Time	 and	 again	 he	 had	 won	 the	 police	 prize	 for	 straight	 shooting from	the	hips.	One	false	move	and	a	member	of	the	little	man’s	gang	would	get	a bullet	in	his	heart	or	his	brain.	Drew	was	good	for	exactly	two	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 a	 tense	 moment.	 Perhaps	 the	 glittering	 eyes	 of	 that	 little	 man	 had	 never wavered.	 Perhaps	 they	 would	 not	 have	 wavered	 now.	 Who	 could	 say?	 No	 one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	at	that	instant	the	lights	went	out,	and	on	the	instant,	save	for	the	feeble	light of	one	small	window,	the	place	was	dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 deep	 silence	 fell	 upon	 the	 room.	 Without	 realizing	 it,	 Drew	 began	 counting under	his	breath:	“One,	two,	three,	four,	five,	six.”	Perhaps	he	was	counting	the seconds	before	things	began	to	happen.	Keeping	a	tight	grip	with	either	hand	on the	things	of	blue	steel	in	his	pockets,	he	waited,	silent,	breathless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	just	become	conscious	of	a	clock	that	ticked	loudly	in	a	corner,	when	a low	gasp	caught	his	attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	knowing	why,	he	fixed	his	eyes	upon	the	one	small	window.	Other	eyes were	fixed	upon	that	narrow	window.	How	many	pairs	of	eyes?	Who	could	say? </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	 was	 moving	 by	 the	 window.	 Not	 a	 person—no,	 surely	 not	 that!	 A skull	 perhaps,	 an	 ugly	 skull	 with	 hollow	 eye	 sockets	 from	 which	 a	 pale	 light gleamed.	A	sigh	passed	over	the	room	like	the	low	moan	of	the	sea	at	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	something	stranger	happened.	The	skull	disappeared	and	a	ghost	with bones	 bleached	 white	 and	 a	 long,	 flowing	 sheet	 went	 racing	 away	 across	 an empty	space	beside	the	building.	Again	the	long	sigh	swept	across	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	the	lights	went	on.	These	lights	disclosed	eight	gentlemen	standing	just as	they	had	stood	before,	staring	rather	stupidly	at	one	another—the	three	alike, the	 big	 man	 and	 his	 son,	 the	 little	 one	 with	 glittering	 eyes	 and	 the	 other	 two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drew	Lane	had	vanished. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a>For	a	full	minute	by	the	clock	on	the	wall	they	stood	there	staring	at	one	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	the	big	man	said	in	a	loud	voice:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Galloping	Ghost!”	After	which	he	let	forth	a	roar	of	laughter	that	suggested a	crazy	baboon	roaring	in	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ten	minutes	later	the	place	was	raided	by	the	police.	There	was	no	one	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	fact	about	this	affair	seems	important.	Drew	Lane	retained	possession	of	the automatic	that	had	fallen	on	the	floor.	This	automatic	was	the	key	to	a	situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	situation?	This,	for	a	while,	was	to	remain	a	mystery. </p>

Here he	stumbled	over	a	boulder,	there	slipped	on	a	stretch	of	earth	that	appeared	to stand	 on	 end,	 and	 here	 found	 himself	 clawing	 madly	 in	 air	 for	 some	 form	 of hand-hold.	That	the	girl	knew	the	trail	well	enough	became	evident	at	once.	She reached	the	crest	of	the	ridge	far	in	advance	of	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here!	 Give	 me	 your	 hand,”	 she	 breathed	 as	 he	 came	 up.	 “It’s	 not	 so	 steep	 on this	side.	Almost	not	steep	at	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	heaved	a	sigh	of	relief,	then	prepared	to	follow	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	trail	was	much	longer	on	this	side.	It	seemed	strange,	this	prowling	about	in the	darkness	on	an	island	he	knew	only	by	name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	his	eyes	became	more	accustomed	to	the	darkness	he	made	out	vague	black</p>
<p class="calibre1">bulks	to	the	right	and	to	the	left.	“Trees,”	he	told	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	one	of	these	black	bulks	let	out	a	low	grunt	and	vanished	into	the	night,	he stopped	short. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Moose,”	 the	 girl	 said	 in	 a	 low	 tone.	 “All	 over	 the	 island.	 Like	 the	 bears	 of Yellowstone.	That	was	probably	old	Uncle	Ned.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uncle	Ned?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	tell	you	about	him	some	time,”	she	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dense	darkness	lay	before	them.	The	girl	plunged	into	this	darkness,	the	shadow</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a>of	a	narrow	stretch	of	forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red’s	ears	caught	the	low	murmur	of	water;	his	gaze	fell	upon	the	white	gleam of	light	upon	the	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We—we’ll	go	to	the	left.	Lots	of	places	there	to	hide.”	Once	again	the	girl	led the	way,	but	not	for	long.	Suddenly	she	stopped	dead	in	her	tracks	to	whisper:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“See!	A	light!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 Red	 looked	 he	 caught	 a	 yellow	 gleam	 that	 came	 filtering	 through	 the branches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wha—what	shall	we	do	now?”	For	the	first	time	the	girl	appeared	at	her	wits’</p>
<p class="calibre1">end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	light	comes	from	a	cabin.”	Red	tried	to	think	the	thing	out	straight.	“Might be	best	to	try	for	a	look.	Then	we’ll	know	what	we’re	up	against,	at	least.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Except	to	give	him	her	hand	the	girl	made	no	reply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowly	now,	with	pulses	pounding,	they	made	their	way	forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	the	left	of	the	trail	they	saw	a	white	bulk,	a	cabin.	They	passed	another.	Then suddenly	 he	 dragged	 the	 girl	 from	 the	 trail.	 An	 unexpected	 sound	 had	 reached his	ears,	a	dog’s	bark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	dog!”	Berley	Todd	shuddered.	“Why	would	they	bring	a	dog	in	the	plane?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To	track	us.	No	wonder	they	were	so	sure	we	wouldn’t	get	away!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	listen!	That	dog’s	inside.	Let’s	go	back	while	there’s	a	chance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	can’t	be	ten	steps	farther.	I’m	for	a	look.	You—you	stay	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	alone.”	She	gripped	his	arm	hard.	“I—I’ll	go.”	It	was	she	who	led	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 dozen	 paces	 more	 and	 they	 stood	 within	 sight	 of	 the	 window	 through	 which the	light	shone.	And	then	a	tall	man,	who	was	just	in	the	act	of	removing	a	ten gallon	hat,	moved	in	front	of	the	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a>“Oh!	It’s	Ed!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	melodious	ring	in	the	girl’s	voice	that	told	plainer	than	words	that they	had	found	a	friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ed	who?	Who’s	Ed?”	Red	was	puzzled	by	this	fresh	turn	of	affairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	Ed.	A	scout.	He	has	a	camp	on	the	island	in	summer.	Always	before	he	left with	the	rest.	But	now	he’s	here,	and	I’m	glad!”	There	was	a	ring	of	pure	joy	in her	 voice.	 “Now—now	 we	 are	 three,	 three	 of	 us	 and	 a	 dog.	 Come	 on!”	 She dragged	him	forward.	“Come	on	before	he	turns	that	dog	loose!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Berley	flashed	the	light	for	an	instant	the	boy	read,	above	the	door:</p>
<p class="calibre1">TRAILSIDE. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wondered	what	that	stood	for.	There	was	no	time	now	for	talk.	Berley’s	hard little	knuckles	had	made	contact	with	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	instant	they	stood	blinking	in	the	light	that	came	from	the	cabin.	Before them,	holding	his	dog	by	the	collar,	was	a	tall,	well-built	man	whose	graying	hair said	 he	 might	 be	 forty.	 His	 face,	 though	 seamed	 and	 tanned	 from	 constant exposure,	 bore	 the	 touch	 of	 eternal	 youth,	 a	 heritage	 of	 those	 who	 spend	 their lives	in	wild	and	silent	places. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	space	of	seconds	he	stared	at	them.	Then	his	face	lighted	with	a	smile	as	he exclaimed:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why!	 It’s	 the	 little	 half-portion,	 Berley	 Todd!	 Put	 her	 there!”	 He	 extended	 a brawny	brown	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	as	if	struck	by	a	sudden	thought,	he	drew	back	and	stared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But—but	what	are	you	doing	here	at	this	time?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Came	by	plane,”	Berley	explained	with	a	laugh.	“Didn’t	you	hear	us	arrive?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“N-no.”	The	look	on	the	guide’s	face	was	strange	to	see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	wouldn’t	of	course.	We	came	in	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>“And	 this—”	 She	 pushed	 her	 companion	 forward.	 “This	 is	 the	 Red	 Rover. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’ve	heard	of	him,	haven’t	you?	The	famous	football	star,	the	Red	Rover?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Y-e-s?”	The	guide	continued	to	stare.	It	was	plain	that	he	believed	little	of	that which	he	had	just	heard.	And	who	could	blame	him?	What	chance	was	there	that the	most	famous	football	star	of	the	season	should	go	off	into	a	wilderness	in	an airplane	a	few	days	before	the	big	game	of	the	year? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	cold.	We—we’d	like	to	come	in,”	the	girl	pleaded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	scout	stared	for	ten	seconds,	then	exclaimed:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Beg	pardon!	Been	a	long	time	since	any	one	was	here.	Didn’t	expect	to	see	a soul	until	spring.	Come	in.	Got	a	big	kettle	of	Mulligan	stew	on	the	stove.	Big feed,	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can’t	 be	 too	 big	 for	 us!”	 said	 Berley,	 closing	 the	 door	 and,	 to	 the	 scout’s bewilderment,	turning	the	key	in	the	lock,	as	she	said	quite	calmly:	“I’d	like	to pull	the	shades	if	you	don’t	mind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why,	yes.	Just	pull	’em	right	down.”	The	scout	stared	afresh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	see,”	explained	“the	little	half-portion,”	dropping	into	a	chair,	“Red,	here, and	I	ran	away.	We—we	don’t	want	any	one	to	know	we	are	here.	Not	a	soul—</p>
<p class="calibre1">except,	of	course,	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks	for	the	compliment,	Miss.	But	I	assure	you	there’ll	not	be	a	soul	here until	spring.	Do	you	plan	to	stay	that	long?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	muscles	of	Berley’s	mouth	were	twitching	desperately.	It	was	great	fun,	this posing	as	the	stolen	bride	of	a	famous	football	star,	but	bottling	up	her	mirth	was quite	another	matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why—why,	we—”	She	tried	hard	to	steady	her	voice.	“We—we	haven’t	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	 definite	 plans,	 have	 we?”	 She	 turned	 to	 Red.	 Then,	 as	 if	 a	 second	 thought had	taken	possession	of	her,	she	demanded:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Red,	what	did	you	do	to	that	plane	when	you	left	me	out	on	the	raft	at	the	back of	Tobin’s	Harbor?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a>“I	took	the	breaker	assemblies	out	of	their	magnetos.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whatever	that	means.”	She	wrinkled	her	brow	in	a	peculiar	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	means,”	Red	measured	his	words,	“that	they	will	have	to	send	to	the	factory for	parts	before	they	can	fly;	in	other	words,	that	they	can’t	leave	the	island.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	makes	it	bad.”	Berley	seemed	worried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	 us.	 They’ll	 be	 after	 us	 night	 and	 day	 to	 get	 those	 parts	 back.	 They’ll	 not leave	 a	 stone	 unturned.	 If	 we	 leave	 the	 island	 before	 they	 do,	 they	 are	 trapped here.	Even	if	they	reached	the	lighthouse	no	one	would	aid	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 the	 officers	 will	 come	 here	 after	 them.”	 Red	 went	 on	 where	 she	 left	 off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	old	friend,	Drew	Lane,	will	be	here	in	his	red	racer.	Grand	coup,	I	call	it!	A bit	 hazardous,	 but	 what	 is	 life	 but	 a	 series	 of	 exciting	 adventures?	 If	 you	 can make	those	adventures	count	for	good,	why	that’s	fine	and	dandy,	I’d	say.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is.”	Beaming,	Berley	put	out	her	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	turning	to	the	puzzled	scout,	she	exclaimed:	“Ed,	you’ve	got	us	all	wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 haven’t	 eloped.	 We’ve	 been	 kidnaped,	 one	 at	 a	 time,	 and	 have	 escaped together.	Now	Red	has	got	to	get	back	to	the	gridiron	for	Saturday’s	game	and	I to	the	bleachers.	You	are	elected	to	help	us.	You	may	get	shot	and	all	that,	but you’ve	got	to	come	along.	You’ve	been	drafted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Understanding	very	little	of	all	this,	but	game	to	the	last,	the	scout	threw	open	a cupboard	to	drag	down	two	huge	pistols. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then,”	 he	 said	 solemnly,	 “it’s	 shootin’	 irons.	 Inherited	 them	 from	 my	 dad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Never	had	much	use	for	’em	except	to	take	a	crack	at	a	prowlin’	coyote	now	and then,	but	I	reckon	I	can	hit	a	tin	can	at	fifty	yards	mighty	nigh	every	pop.	And that’s	good	enough	for	coarse	work.	I’m	with	you,	little	half-portion,	with	you	to the	end.”	Then,	as	if	she	were	a	child,	he	seized	her	about	the	waist	and	bumped her	head	against	the	ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mulligan’s	 done,”	 he	 announced	 a	 moment	 later.	 “What	 am	 I	 really	 drafted into?	You’ll	tell	me	that,	won’t	you,	over	the	Mulligan	stew	and	coffee?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a><b class="calibre4">CHAPTER	XVI</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">THE	BRANDED	BULLET</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">To	 inform	 you	 that	 Drew	 Lane	 made	 his	 escape	 from	 a	 perilous	 position	 while the	Galloping	Ghost	was	doing	his	bit	would	be	to	waste	words.	There	are	times, of	course,	when	it	is	an	officer’s	duty	to	stand	his	ground	and	shoot	it	out	with the	outlaws	who	chance	to	cross	his	path.	This	was	not	one	of	those	times.	Drew Lane	went	for	reinforcements.	That	he	did	not	return	in	time	was	an	unavoidable misfortune.	He	was	obliged	to	content	himself	with	turning	in	a	detailed	report of	 the	 affair	 together	 with	 an	 accurate	 description	 of	 the	 individuals	 who composed	the	band. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	know	that	little	fellow	with	the	fiery	eyes	anywhere,”	he	said	to	Tom	Howe, as	he	sat	at	his	desk.	“His	scar	marks	him	if	nothing	else	does. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 those	 three	 fellows	 that	 look	 just	 alike.	 Suppose	 they	 scatter.	 How’s	 a fellow	 to	 tell	 which	 is	 which?	 Clever,	 I	 call	 it.	 Suppose	 one	 is	 suspected	 of	 a stick-up.	 Suppose	 he’s	 put	 in	 the	 ‘show	 up’	 on	 Sunday	 morning.	 Then	 suppose the	victim	says:	‘That’s	the	man.’	But	suppose	the	other	two	are	in	the	line	and the	victim	says	again	and	yet	again:	‘That’s	the	man.’	And	each	time	he’s	seeing a	different	one.	Which	of	the	three	will	be	tried	and	convicted?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’d	be	a	mix-up,”	Tom	grinned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure	would. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 look,	 Tom.”	 Drew	 placed	 a	 thing	 of	 blue	 steel	 on	 the	 table.	 “Here’s	 the automatic	that	the	little	fellow	with	fiery	eyes	dropped.	He’s	the	sort	that	shoots on	 sight.	 He	 may	 have	 done	 some	 shooting	 right	 here	 in	 town.	 It	 might	 just happen	that	you’ve	got	a	bullet	in	your	collection	that	came	from	his	gun.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Might	 at	 that.”	 Tom	 took	 the	 gun.	 “Quite	 a	 collection	 of	 bullets	 I’ve	 got	 right</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>now.	There’s	the	one	that	stopped	Patrolman	O’Malley	down	by	the	Stock	Yards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s	the	one	that	passed	through	the	Chink’s	heart	and	landed	in	a	wall	down in	Chinatown.	Six	or	seven	more.	I’ll	try	it	out.	Want	to	come	along,	Johnny?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	Thompson	dropped	the	book	he	was	reading.	“I’ll	be	glad	to!”	Anything that	had	to	do	with	scientific	crime	detection	might	claim	this	boy’s	attention,	be it	day	or	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom	Howe	and	Johnny	dropped	down	to	the	basement	where	a	bullet	might	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">fired	 into	 a	 barrel	 of	 sawdust	 without	 disturbing	 the	 guests	 of	 the	 hotel.	 Drew finished	his	report,	dispatched	it	by	a	messenger	and	then,	having	extinguished his	 lamp	 of	 gleaming	 white	 light,	 switched	 on	 one	 of	 faint	 blue	 that	 gave	 the whole	place	an	air	of	spooky	mystery.	It	was	thus	that	he	could	best	think	out	the problems	which	lay	directly	before	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	 whole	 day	 gone,”	 he	 told	 himself.	 “And	 what	 have	 we?	 A	 bed	 sheet	 taken from	 a	 sleeping	 car.	 An	 invisible	 footprint	 on	 that	 sheet.	 But	 whose	 footprint? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shall	we	ever	know?	A	bullet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	spread	out	a	sheet	of	paper	to	examine	it	afresh.	“A	second	message	from	the dead,”	 he	 murmured.	 “At	 least	 from	 the	 Galloping	 Ghost.	 Pretty	 hard-fisted ghost	at	that.	Knocks	Tom	down;	then	when	he	is	gone,	digs	a	bullet	from	some post	or	railway	tie,	and	presents	it	for	our	inspection.	He	says	here	that	the	bullet is	 the	 one	 fired	 at	 Tom	 out	 there	 by	 the	 Red	 Rover’s	 sleeping	 car.	 ‘Find	 that man.’	And	then—sure,	find	him	if	you	can! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 this	 jack-knife	 business,”	 he	 mused	 on.	 “The	 Ghost	 says	 one	 of	 the kidnapers	has	the	whittling	habit,	that	while	waiting	for	Red	to	fall	asleep	he	sat on	 a	 pile	 of	 ties	 and	 whittled	 at	 a	 soft	 stick.	 A	 knife	 blade,	 he	 says,	 when examined	 under	 a	 microscope	 shows	 some	 irregularities	 on	 its	 edge,	 even	 the sharpest	of	’em.	I	suppose	that’s	right.	But	what	of	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	sat	for	some	time	in	a	brown	study	from	which	he	emerged	with	a	start	and	a low	exclamation:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Something	to	it!	What?	Might	be	a	lot!	I’ll	have	to	get	Tom	digging	into	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	and	his	microscope	have	solved	many	a	baffling	crime.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	 again	 he	 settled	 back	 into	 meditation.	 “Speed	 boat	 tied	 up	 far	 down	 the river.	Airplane	hangar	nearby.	Police	have	searched	all	buildings	near	there.	No</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a>result.	 Looks	 like	 an	 airplane	 job.	 Spirited	 away	 in	 an	 airplane.	 What	 could	 be simpler?	Wonder	if	the	night	mechanic	at	the	airport	knows	anything?	If	he	does, like	as	not	he	wouldn’t	tell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	 thing	 sure!”	 He	 brought	 his	 chair	 down	 with	 a	 bang.	 “We’ve	 got	 to	 get action,	and	get	it	quick!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seizing	 the	 evening	 paper	 he	 scanned	 its	 front	 page.	 GHOST	 GALLOPS</p>
<p class="calibre1">AGAIN	 was	 sprawled	 across	 the	 front	 page.	 And	 below,	 RED	 ROVER	 STILL</p>
<p class="calibre1">MISSING.	POLICE	HAVE	NOTHING	TO	REPORT. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well—”	 Drew	 smiled	 grimly.	 “Hold	 your	 horses.	 We	 may	 report	 something yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again	 he	 read,	 in	 smaller	 type:	 “The	 public	 is	 aroused	 by	 this	 daring	 crime.	 A large	 purse	 is	 being	 raised	 as	 a	 reward	 for	 the	 return	 of	 the	 Red	 Rover.	 The Midway	coach	is	game.	He	is	drilling	his	team	hard	in	the	face	of	almost	certain defeat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Too	bad!”	Drew	shook	his	head.	“Probably	his	last	great	game.	They	say	he	is to	 retire	 at	 the	 close	 of	 this	 season.	 Everything	 was	 set	 for	 a	 glorious	 victory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	now	this!	The	plans	wrecked	by	a	gang	of	outlaws	who	deserve	nothing	but to	 die	 horribly.	 And	 here	 we	 are	 doing	 our	 best,	 working	 night	 and	 day, following	blind	trails,	getting	nowhere.	We—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	broke	short	off	as	a	fist	banged	the	door	and	a	voice	demanded:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Open	up!	Let	me	in!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	Johnny.	As	a	bringer	of	good	news	he	had	outstripped	Tom	Howe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Drew!	Drew!”	he	panted.	“That’s	the	gun!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	gun	is	which	gun?”	Drew	grinned	in	spite	of	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	bullet	fits	that	gun.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which	bullet	fits	what	gun?	Sit	down	and	tell	me	about	it.”	He	pushed	him	into a	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a>After	 a	 breathing	 spell	 Johnny	 was	 able	 to	 tell	 a	 connected	 story.	 He	 and	 Tom Howe	had	gone	to	the	basement	and	had	fired	three	bullets	from	the	gun	Drew</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 picked	 up	 on	 the	 floor	 of	 the	 place	 where,	 for	 a	 very	 good	 reason,	 he	 had eaten	no	supper.	Having	fired	the	bullets	into	sawdust,	they	had	picked	them	out and	had	examined	them	under	the	microscope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	how	it	is,”	he	went	on.	“Every	gun	barrel	has	microscopic	defects	on the	inside.	These	leave	their	marks	on	the	bullet.	The	bullet	left	by	the	Galloping Ghost	apparently	struck	the	steel	car	a	glancing	blow	and	then	entered	a	block	of wood.	 One	 side	 was	 flat,	 but	 the	 other	 showed	 its	 marking	 clearly.	 And	 the scratches	on	that	bullet,	four	of	them,	clearly	marked,	exactly	matched	the	ones fired	from	the	gun	you	took	from	that	little	fellow	with	a	branded	forehead	and fiery	eye.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	did!”	Drew	dropped	in	a	heap	on	a	chair.	“So	that	was	the	man!	And	I	had him,	had	him	in	my	hands!	And	I	let	him	go!	What	a	break!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny,	as	he	recalled	the	circumstances,	was	not	sure	whether	Drew	had	had	the little	man	or	the	little	man	and	his	gang	had	had	Drew;	but	he	said	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	get	’em.	We’ll	get	’em	yet!”	Drew	came	to	his	feet	with	a	bound.	“Get	the Chief	on	the	wire.	He’ll	send	out	a	drag-net.	A	mob	like	that	can’t	cruise	about this	city	without	being	caught.	They’re	marked	men,	every	one	of	them!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Was	he	right?	Only	time	would	tell. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In	the	meantime	Red	Rodgers,	the	object	of	all	this	activity	in	a	great	city,	sat	at a	 small	 table	 in	 a	 cozy	 cabin	 on	 Isle	 Royale,	 hundreds	 of	 miles	 away,	 calmly sipping	the	broth	from	a	delicious	Mulligan	stew	(which,	by	the	way,	is	made	by cooking	up	everything	you	have	in	the	way	of	meat	and	vegetables,	then	adding much	sliced	bacon	and	many	onions). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 stew	 was	 good.	 The	 cabin	 was	 warm.	 The	 hour	 was	 late.	 When	 Red	 had emptied	his	bowl	he	sat	back	to	nod	drowsily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 good	 to	 be	 lazy	 and	 comfortable	 and	 to	 do	 nothing,”	 he	 murmured.	 It seemed	to	him	now	that	he	had	somehow	been	drugged.	Never	before	had	he	felt so	little	desire	for	action.	“I	wish	those	crooks	would	leave	us	alone,”	he	thought to	himself.	“I	wish	I	could	sleep	for	a	week.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	what	was	this?	A	voice	sounded	in	the	room,	a	strange	voice.	And	what	was this	man	saying? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 listening	 world	 will	 be	 interested	 to	 know	 that	 while	 the	 football	 star, officially	known	as	the	Red	Rover—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Red—Red	 Rover.”	 The	 boy	 sat	 up,	 quite	 awake	 now.	 “Why,	 that	 is	 the	 radio! </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’re	talking	about	me.	And	here	I	am	listening	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	 the	 scout	 chuckled,	 “that’s	 Chicago.	 Haven’t	 listened	 to	 that	 station before,	or	I’d	have	known.	Bet	they’re	broadcasting	reports	every	hour.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	not?	You’re	a	star.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a>“A	star	to-day;	to-morrow	a	steel	mill	worker.	What	does	one	star	more	or	less matter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	all	that,	he	sat	up	and	listened	with	increasing	interest	as	the	speaker	told	of all	that	was	being	done	to	apprehend	the	kidnapers	and	return	the	Rover	to	his team. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	old	Drew	Lane,”	he	murmured.	“He’ll	get	’em.	You’ll	see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 after	 all—.	 His	 spirits	 drooped.	 After	 all,	 what	 could	 it	 matter?	 He	 might discover	who	the	kidnapers	were.	But	would	he	trace	them	to	Isle	Royale?	Ah, no.	That	was	expecting	too	much! </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	felt	a	tightening	at	his	throat	as	he	thought	of	his	team	mates	and	the	coach, the	 Grand	 Old	 Man,	 doing	 their	 best	 to	 stave	 off	 defeat.	 “It’s	 not	 that	 I’m	 so important	as	an	individual,”	he	told	himself	humbly,	“but	I’m	part	of	the	piece, like	one	stone	in	an	arch.	Without	me	the	team	must	fail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	am	I	here?”	he	cried	out	suddenly,	springing	to	his	feet.	“How	can	I	get away?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	you	can’t,”	the	guide	said	quietly.	“We’ll	do	the	best	we	can. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen!”	The	guide	blew	out	the	lamp,	then	quietly	opened	the	door.	Bing,	the dog,	uttered	a	low	growl.	He	was	silenced	by	his	master. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	somewhere	away	off	in	the	dark	came	a	weird,	wild	call.	It	was	answered here	and	answered	there.	Then	such	a	chorus	as	never	before	was	heard	on	sea	or land	rose	above	the	sound	of	rushing	water	and	sighing	pines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wolves,”	Ed	commented	briefly.	“Bush	wolves.	Hundreds	of	’em	on	the	island. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’re	all	singing	to-night.	There	will	be	a	storm.	Listen	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	 is	 a	 little	 sea	 to-night.	 To-morrow	 it	 will	 be	 raging.	 The	 distance	 from Rock	of	Ages	on	this	island	to	the	mainland	is	seventeen	miles.	Rock	of	Ages	is forty	miles	from	here.	There	are	power	boats	here,	but	no	gasoline.	You’d	have to	row.	You’d	never	make	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our	only	chance	is	Passage	Island,”	Berley	Todd	put	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a>“Absolutely!	 But	 that	 is	 four	 miles	 from	 Blake’s	 Point.	 Four	 miles	 of	 raging black	waters.	And	Lake	Superior	never	gives	up	her	dead.	No.	No,	son.	You’ll	be staying	 here	 a	 spell	 yet.	 And	 why	 not?	 Really	 you	 should	 see	 a	 little	 of	 Rock Harbor	while	you’re	here.	That’s	what	they	say	in	summer.”	He	laughed.	“Why</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	was	to	see	something	of	Rock	Harbor	indeed.	Pictures	of	this	unusual	little corner	 of	 the	 world	 were	 to	 hang	 for	 many	 a	 day	 on	 the	 walls	 of	 his	 memory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	of	these	he	would	cherish,	and	some	he	would	be	glad	to	forget. </p>
<p class="calibre1">* 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 *</p>
<p class="calibre1">Next	 morning,	 in	 the	 distant	 city,	 there	 was	 a	 council	 of	 war.	 Drew	 Lane,	 Tom Howe	and	Johnny	Thompson	sat	around	Drew’s	desk.	Coffee	had	been	sent	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	a	tin	pail.	They	were	imbibing	freely	as	they	talked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 police	 drag-net	 caught	 never	 a	 thing,”	 Drew	 announced.	 “They’ve vanished,	 all	 that	 gang	 belonging	 to	 the	 fiery-eyed	 fellow,	 the	 big	 man	 and	 his son,	the	three	just	alike,	and	the	two	others.	And	that,”	he	sighed,	“leaves	us	just where	we	were.	We	have	the	gun	that	was	fired	at	you,	Tom,	but	we	haven’t	the man.	The	Red	Rover	is	still	a	captive.	And	why?	Will	you	answer	me	that?	Have the	authorities	over	at	Old	Midway	received	demands	for	ransom	money?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	a	scratch.”	Tom’s	brow	wrinkled.	“Had	them	on	the	wire	half	an	hour	ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s	another	case	up	just	now,	too;	just	as	strange	in	a	way.	Little	lady	named Berley	Todd;	old	man	Todd’s	daughter,	steel	magnate,	or	something	of	the	sort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	a	word	from	her	either,	though	that’s	not	our	problem.	We’re	out	to	find	the Red	Rover.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	and	that	promises	to	be	enough	to	keep	us	awake	nights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tom,”	Drew’s	tone	changed,	“did	you	ever	hear	of	a	pocket	knife	convicting	a man?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stabbing	case?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	whittling,	just	plain	whittling.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why,	 yes.	 Let	 me	 see.	 There	 was	 one.	 A	 fellow	 shot	 a	 former	 partner	 of	 his. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trapper	 he	 was,	 I	 think.	 He	 built	 a	 blind	 of	 green	 willow	 branches.	 Cut	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>branches	 with	 his	 pocket	 knife.	 Shot	 the	 fellow	 behind	 this	 blind.	 The	 sheriff found	the	blind.	Then	he	found	the	knife	in	the	fellow’s	cabin.	He	sent	the	knife and	willow	stubs	to	the	Crime	Laboratory.	They	studied	the	knife	blade	and	the cuttings.	That	was	the	knife	all	right;	irregularities	in	the	cuttings	were	the	same as	on	the	knife	blade.	The	trouble	was,	they	couldn’t	prove	that	the	knife	had	not been	planted	in	the	fellow’s	cabin,	so	the	thing	fell	through.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sounds	 interesting.”	 Drew	 drained	 his	 cup.	 “Wish	 you’d	 take	 a	 look	 at	 these through	your	microscope.”	He	pushed	a	handful	of	shavings	toward	his	partner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Galloping	Ghost	left	them,	you	remember. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	here	is	the	collection	of	pocket	knives.	You’ll	be	able	to	tell	whether	one	of these	did	the	whittling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 see,”	 he	 explained,	 “some	 fellow	 connected	 with	 the	 kidnaping	 sat	 and whittled	while	he	waited	for	the	Red	Rover	to	fall	asleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Strange	 how	 often	 men’s	 habits	 convict	 them,”	 he	 philosophized.	 “If	 you’re	 a whittler	you’ll	have	your	knife	out	on	every	occasion,	whittling,	just	whittling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	man,”	he	took	up	a	shaving,	“must	be	a	nervous	sort.	See	how	short	these are.	 If	 he	 were	 a	 meditative	 person,	 quite	 at	 ease,	 he	 would	 take	 long,	 smooth strokes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	look	these	over.”	Tom	swept	the	shavings	into	an	envelope.	“There	might	be something	in	it.	Can’t	afford	to	neglect	the	least	clue.	If	it	interests	the	old	G.G. </p>
<p class="calibre1">it	should	have	our	attention.	By	the	way,	what’s	your	idea	about	this	Galloping Ghost?	Who	is	he?	And	what’s	he	after?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 answer.”	 Drew	 grinned.	 “All	 I	 know	 is	 that	 he	 seems	 to	 be	 on	 our	 side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	enough	for	the	present.	I—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be	 careful!”	 He	 turned	 suddenly	 to	 Johnny.	 “Don’t	 bend	 that.	 It	 might	 be important.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	it?”	The	boy	held	up	a	thin	bit	of	sheet	aluminum	that	had	been	pressed into	a	curious	form. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That,”	 Tom	 explained,	 “is	 an	 impression	 taken	 from	 the	 bottom	 of	 a	 sleeping car	window.	When	the	Red	Rover	was	kidnaped	the	window	was	jimmied.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>end	 of	 the	 bar	 made	 a	 deep	 impression	 in	 the	 wood.	 It	 was	 an	 old	 bar	 with several	nicks	in	it.	If	I	ever	come	upon	it	I	could	identify	it	by	this	impression.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This,”	 said	 Johnny,	 “is	 getting	 too	 deep	 for	 me.	 Invisible	 footprints	 on	 sheets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shavings	from	some	whittler’s	knife.	Impressions	in	wood.	These	are	to	bring	a man	to	justice.	Pipe	dreaming,	I	call	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	the	way!”	he	exclaimed.	“I	have	a	jimmy	bar	all	my	own.	Saved	it	from	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">watery	grave.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stepping	to	the	corner	he	produced	a	paper-wrapped	package	and	then	revealed the	bar	he	had	taken	from	the	speed	boat	of	Angelo	Piccalo,	Junior. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	have	a	look!”	Tom	Howe’s	eyes	fairly	bulged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Say,	boy!”	he	cried	ten	seconds	later.	“That’s	the	bar!	Where’d	you	get	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why,	what	do	you	mean?	The	bar?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 mean	 it’s	 the	 bar	 that	 pried	 that	 car	 window	 open.	 See!	 The	 impression	 fits exactly.	I	say!	Where’d	you	get	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing	to	get	excited	about,”	Johnny	grumbled.	“Some	one	stuck	it	in	the	back of	Angelo’s	speed	boat.	Young	Angelo,	you	know,	son	of	the	flower	shop	man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Back	of	the	boy’s	speed	boat.	Humph!”	Slouching	down	in	his	chair,	Tom	fell into	a	brown	study. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	 dig	 into	 this	 whittling	 business,”	 he	 said,	 at	 last	 rousing	 himself.	 “There might	be	something	in	it.	You	never	can	tell.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a><b class="calibre4">CHAPTER	XVIII</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">DREAMING	AT	DAWN</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">After	ten	winks	caught	in	the	scout’s	cozy	cabin,	Red	Rodgers	and	Berley	Todd were	up	before	dawn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 don’t	 think	 much	 of	 the	 bush	 wolves	 as	 weather	 prophets,”	 Red	 said	 in	 a hoarse	whisper.	He	was	ever	conscious	that	their	lives	were	in	danger.	“What	a morning!	We	must	get	a	rowboat	and	be	away	for	Passage	Island.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	 the	 light	 of	 day?”	 The	 girl	 pressed	 his	 arm	 hard.	 “They’d	 see	 us.	 Then	 all would	be	at	an	end.	But	no,	perhaps	not.	There	are	islands,	small	islands	all	in	a row	 that	 lie	 half	 a	 mile	 off	 this	 main	 shore.	 Once	 behind	 those,	 we	 would	 be hidden.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	have	a	look.	Which	way	is	the	shore?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Over	this	way.”	The	girl	led	him	down	a	path	that,	circling	a	clump	of	bushes, led	them	past	a	group	of	buildings	that	loomed	large	in	the	blue-gray	dawn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	passed	through	tall	grass	drenched	with	dew,	to	climb	at	last	a	pile	of	rocks and	finally	reach	a	great	boulder	that	overlooked	the	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 this	 moment	 of	 hushed	 silence	 just	 before	 dawn,	 the	 water	 was	 like	 glass, smooth	white	glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	could	be	sweeter?	We	must	find	a	boat	at	once.”	Red	turned	his	eyes	upon the	girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 realized	 at	 once	 that	 she	 had	 not	 heard	 him.	 She	 was	 listening	 instead	 for some	sound	that	must	come	from	far	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	willing	it,	he	also	listened;	heard	it,	too,	a	long,	deep,	long-drawn	sigh. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a>No	human	sigh	was	this,	but	the	sigh	of	great	waters.	He	heard	it	again	and	yet again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	as	if	Father	Superior	were	waking	from	his	sleep,”	the	girl	whispered.	“It tells	of	a	coming	storm.	We	must	not	go.	We	must	wait.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 had	 not	 long	 to	 wait.	 As	 the	 water	 took	 on	 the	 faint	 pink	 of	 dawn	 a	 mist appeared	to	rise	from	afar	and	to	steal	upon	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	by	one	the	distant	points	of	land	became	misty	suggestions,	mere	ghosts	of earth.	 Like	 ten	 thousand	 great	 white	 fish	 leaping	 in	 the	 sea,	 two	 miles	 away white-caps	 appeared,	 while	 in	 the	 foreground	 with	 the	 gray-black	 sky	 as	 a reflecting	mirror,	the	water	took	on	a	startling	clearness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gulls	ceased	to	soar	and	scream.	Settling	upon	a	rocky	ledge,	they	stood	erect, silent,	 like	 uniformed	 officers	 observing	 the	 outcome	 of	 a	 battle.	 From	 time	 to time	 a	 member	 of	 the	 party,	 some	 aid-de-camp,	 came	 soaring	 in	 to	 report	 the results	of	his	observation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	all	the	time	ten	thousand	spots	of	gleaming	white	advanced.	Now	they	were two	miles	away,	a	mile	and	a	half,	a	mile,	half	a	mile.	Like	some	dirigible	swept from	 its	 mooring,	 a	 fragment	 of	 cloud	 detached	 itself	 from	 the	 vast	 mass	 and came	sweeping	over.	It	left	in	its	wake	a	disturbing	chill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	now	the	spots	of	white	lay	before	them,	at	their	very	feet.	A	burst	of	wind swept	 the	 hair	 back	 from	 the	 girl’s	 temples.	 The	 wind	 increased	 in	 volume. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Waves	began	beating	at	the	rocks.	A	few	large	rain	drops	spattered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then,	 with	 a	 suddenness	 that	 was	 startling,	 the	 storm	 broke.	 Rain	 came down	in	torrents.	Wind	twisted	at	the	birches,	and	set	all	the	spruces	whispering and	sighing.	The	ever-increasing	roar	of	water	on	the	rocks	vied	with	the	din	of crashing	 thunder.	 The	 sky,	 laced	 and	 interlaced	 by	 lightning,	 revealed	 itself	 as some	vast	shroud.	There	are	no	storms	like	the	storms	of	November. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	even	the	fury	of	nature	is	futile.	Men	do	not	agree	upon	man’s	destiny.	No more	 does	 nature	 agree	 upon	 its	 own.	 Rain	 beating	 upon	 the	 water	 subdued	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">White	water	vanished.	The	beating	of	waves	subsided.	Having	outdone	itself,	in its	mad	fury,	the	wind	swept	the	clouds	to	other	lands	and	other	waters.	A	brief half	hour	and	a	scene	of	surpassing	beauty,	a	tiny	world	studded	with	diamonds lay	before	the	waiting	pair. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a>“It	 is	 over,”	 Red	 whispered	 from	 the	 depths	 of	 a	 great	 spruce	 where	 they	 had found	shelter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	now,”	came	the	girl’s	experienced	reply.	“For	all	that,	we	do	not	stir	from this	spot.	Superior	has	moods	all	its	own.	And	remember,	Superior	never	gives up	its	dead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leading	the	way	out	from	their	sheltered	nook,	she	perched	herself	upon	a	high rock.	 Red	 took	 a	 place	 beside	 her.	 When	 she	 spoke	 again	 a	 dreamy	 look	 had overspread	her	countenance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This,”	 she	 said,	 spreading	 her	 arms	 wide,	 “this	 is	 Isle	 Royale.	 Forget	 the drifting	leaves,	the	gray	tossing	branches.	It	is	summer	now.	Night	has	come	and a	 great	 golden	 moon	 paints	 a	 patch	 of	 silver	 down	 the	 bay.	 The	 rippling	 water seems	 alive.	 Every	 tiny	 wave	 bears	 a	 tinier	 craft	 upon	 its	 bosom—the	 silver schooner	of	a	fairy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen!	 From	 far	 down	 the	 bay	 comes,	 wafted	 on	 by	 the	 breeze,	 the	 faintest suggestion	of	a	song.	What	is	it,	the	whisper	of	a	bird	talking	to	his	mate? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	There	comes	the	put-put	of	a	motor,	yet	even	this	seems	to	keep	time	to	the music	 that,	 gathering	 power	 and	 sweetness,	 floats	 on	 and	 on	 down	 the	 bay.	 A craft	appears.	All	white	in	the	moonlight,	it	seems	as	unreal	as	a	fairy’s	dream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Strange	men	who	drift	about	our	island	in	tiny	gas	boats.	Like	gypsies	they	are. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 are	 here.	 Who	 are	 they?	 You	 do	 not	 care	 to	 know.	 Where	 did	 they	 come from?	The	mines,	the	forests,	the	pulp	mills	perhaps.	This	does	not	matter.	They are	here.	They	have	a	tune	for	you.	They	belong	to	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	with	the	moon	hanging	high,	they	drift	down	that	silver	patch	of	moonlight to	 vanish	 into	 the	 night.	 And	 still,	 long	 after	 they	 are	 lost	 from	 sight,	 comes wafted	 in	 by	 the	 wind	 and	 waves	 faint,	 sweet	 music	 that	 one	 cannot	 forget. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This,”	she	sighed,	“is	Isle	Royale	in	summer.	And	you	have	not	seen	it,	and	have never	heard	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	all	this—”	Red	smiled	down	at	her.	“All	this	is	play.	And	I	never	play.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 you	 will!	 You	 must!”	 she	 exclaimed	 in	 a	 breath.	 “You	 will	 play	 with	 me here.	See!	A	storm	is	rising,	a	three	days’	storm. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a>“See!	 It	 is	 light.	 We	 are	 in	 danger!	 We	 must	 hurry	 back	 to	 our	 refuge.”	 Like	 a gleam	of	white	light	she	was	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a><b class="calibre4">CHAPTER	XIX</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">NIGHT	ON	ISLE	ROYALE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	again	it	was	night	on	Isle	Royale.	All	day	a	wild	south-easter	had	lashed the	waters	of	Lake	Superior	into	foam.	All	day	in	the	scout’s	cabin	Red	Rodgers and	Berley	Todd	had	waited	for	that	which	they	felt	to	be	inevitable—the	arrival of	the	kidnapers	and	the	battle	that	must	follow.	Or	would	there	be	a	battle?	The snow	 had	 melted.	 No	 footprints	 remained.	 Perhaps	 Ed	 could	 make	 the	 outlaws believe	they	were	not	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 a	 time	 after	 a	 breakfast	 of	 sour	 dough	 flapjacks	 they	 sat	 discussing possibilities.	After	that,	overcome	by	their	long	vigil,	they	slept. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	that	night	had	come,	they	were	as	wide	awake	as	night	owls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	tough	to	be	waiting	without	knowing	what	they	are	about,”	Red	exploded	at last.	“I’d	almost	rather	meet	them	face	to	face	and	fight	it	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	no!	Not	that!”	The	girl	shuddered.	“But	we	might	have	a	look	at	them	from the	 Palisades.	 Surely	 we’d	 not	 meet	 them	 on	 that	 trail.	 And,	 if	 we	 should,	 we could	lose	ourselves	on	the	instant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Safe	enough,”	Ed	commented. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	the	Palisades?”	Red	rose	as	if	prepared	to	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	highest	point	on	this	ridge,”	the	guide	explained.	“Trees	are	cut	away	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	can	look	down	a	hundred	feet	to	Tobin’s	Harbor.	Their	camp’s	back	there.	If there’s	 a	 light	 showing	 they	 will	 still	 be	 in	 camp.	 If	 one	 moves	 on	 the	 water, you’ll	know	they	are	out	looking	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	need	for	me	to	go,”	he	added,	nodding	at	Berley	Todd.	“She	knows	every</p>
<p class="calibre1">step	of	the	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a>“In	the	dark?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	 the	 dark.	 But	 there’s	 a	 little	 light.	 Better	 take	 your	 flashlight.	 Don’t	 use	 it unless	you	have	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	short	time	later	two	dusky	figures	stole	out	into	the	night,	a	tall	one	and	a	short one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	silence	they	passed	through	a	narrow	fringe	of	spruce,	birch	and	balsam	with here	and	there	a	cottage	looming	black	and	silent	in	the	dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	the	girl	seized	Red’s	arm	to	point	through	a	clump	of	shapely	spruce	trees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That,”	she	whispered	impressively,	“is	my	home—my	summer	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	 the	 storm	 keeps	 up,	 shall	 we	 go	 there,	 perhaps	 to-morrow	 night,	 you	 and	 I and	Ed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	mounted	a	low	hill,	then	followed	along	a	tree-grown	ridge.	He	marveled at	 her	 ability	 to	 find	 her	 way	 in	 the	 dark.	 “Great	 little	 sport,	 this	 one,”	 he	 told himself.	“Not	soft	like	so	many	girls.”	This	was	true.	The	hand	that	gripped	his arm	was	as	hard	and	muscular	as	a	boy’s.	So	was	her	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	his	mind’s	eye	he	saw	Lake	Superior	flecked	with	foam,	four	miles	of	it.	“It’s going	to	be	tough,	at	best.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here!”	 the	 girl	 whispered	 in	 his	 ear.	 “It’s	 just	 up	 there.	 The	 trail’s	 almost straight	up.	Follow	me.	Be	sure	of	your	footing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 dark	 form	 loomed	 above	 him,	 but	 from	 her	 lips	 came	 no	 panting	 breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fit,”	 he	 told	 himself.	 “As	 fit	 as	 a	 marathon	 runner.”	 A	 moment	 of	 wild scrambling	and	he	stood	beside	her.	At	that	instant	the	clouds	parted	and,	for	a space	of	seconds,	the	harbor	lay	beneath	them	in	all	the	dark,	majestic	beauty	of a	moonlight	night.	Almost	directly	beneath	them,	a	golden	ball,	lay	the	reflection of	the	moon.	Off	to	the	left	a	dark	bulk	loomed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Island.”	Berley	caught	her	breath	as	she	whispered:	“Kidnaper’s	island.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 a	 black	 cloud	 obscured	 the	 light	 and	 the	 harbor.	 The	 distant	 shore	 lay</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a>beneath	them,	a	vast	well	of	darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Darkness?	Not	quite	all.	From	the	far	end	of	that	long,	narrow	island	on	which their	log	prison	stood,	a	pale	yellow	light	shone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	are	there,”	the	girl	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At	least	some	of	them,”	Red	amended. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	can	go	down	this	way.”	Once	again	the	girl	led. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 time	 they	 came	 to	 a	 spot	 Red	 recognized,	 the	 short	 dock	 at	 which	 they	 had disembarked	on	the	previous	night.	The	rowboat	they	had	taken	from	the	island still	bumped	at	the	dock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	 Red,	 reared	 as	 he	 had	 been	 close	 to	 the	 slips	 where	 rusty	 ore	 boats	 lay	 at anchor,	a	boat,	any	sort	of	boat,	had	an	all	but	irresistible	appeal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently	some	such	spell	hung	over	the	girl,	for	when	he	gave	her	his	hand	to help	 her	 into	 the	 boat	 she	 did	 not	 say,	 “No,	 no!	 We	 dare	 not.”	 Instead,	 she whispered:	“We	will	glide	along	in	the	shadows.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	oars	made	no	sound.	Sky	and	water	seemed	one.	To	the	girl,	as	she	sat	in	the stern,	they	appeared	to	float	in	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then,	all	in	a	flash,	this	stillness	was	shattered.	The	prow	of	their	boat	struck some	solid	object	with	a	dull	thud.	That	same	instant	it	reared	high	in	air	to	pitch the	dreaming	girl	into	cold,	black	waters	of	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Paralyzed	by	the	suddenness	of	it	all,	the	boy,	riding	high	in	air	but	still	clinging to	his	seat,	saw	her	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	space	of	seconds	he	hung	there	in	midair.	Then	with	a	dull	splash	the	boat fell	once	more	to	the	water.	At	that	same	instant	he	saw	that	which	caused	him	to rub	 his	 eyes	 and	 stare.	 At	 a	 speed	 quite	 impossible	 for	 a	 swimmer	 of	 the	 girl’s skill	 or	 strength	 she	 was	 streaking	 away	 across	 the	 water	 toward	 an	 island	 that loomed	out	of	the	dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	trap,”	he	thought.	“They—they	got	her!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a>Seizing	the	oars,	he	swung	the	boat	about	and	began	rowing	madly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">* 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 *</p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	during	this	same	hour	that	Johnny	Thompson	happened	upon	something</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 mystified	 him	 more	 than	 he	 was	 willing	 to	 admit.	 This	 affair	 might	 have ended	badly	but	for	the	boy’s	splendid	physique	and	careful	training. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	about	to	pass	over	the	river	bridge	on	his	way	home	when	his	eye	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">caught	by	a	brilliant	display	of	flowers	in	Angelo	Piccalo’s	window.	Coming	to	a halt,	 he	 stood	 there	 studying	 the	 flowers	 for	 some	 little	 time.	 “Some	 flowers	 I never	saw,”	he	told	himself.	“Have	to	ask	Angelo	about	them.	Those	red,	heart-shaped	ones	and—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 thoughts	 broke	 off.	 Two	 men,	 having	 crossed	 the	 bridge,	 hesitated	 a moment,	then	went	down	the	stairway	leading	to	the	breakwater	landing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	queer,”	he	told	himself,	“at	this	hour	of	the	night!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 he	 lingered	 his	 wonder	 grew,	 for	 two	 more	 men	 appeared	 from	 the	 dark bridge	and	descended	into	the	depths	below,	and	after	these	came	three	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	have	a	look,”	he	told	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 he	 shifted	 his	 position	 a	 door	 at	 the	 foot	 of	 the	 stairs	 opened	 and	 a	 man disappeared.	 “Odd	 sort	 of	 business.	 A	 door	 opens.	 No	 light	 comes	 out.	 Yet	 the man	goes	in.	Something	wrong	about	that.	That’s	beneath	Angelo’s	flower	shop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s	my	friend.	I’ll	have	a	glimpse	inside.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 glance	 inside	 netted	 nothing	 but	 darkness.	 Putting	 out	 a	 hand,	 he	 pressed against	a	surface	that	yielded—a	silent,	swinging	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	once	he	was	in	a	large,	smoke-filled	room.	A	curious	place	it	was,	fitted	with tables	and	a	counter;	yet	there	was	apparently	nothing	to	sell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 strange	 feeling	 of	 discontent	 appeared	 to	 hover	 over	 the	 room.	 Johnny	 felt	 a desire	 to	 vanish.	 He	 resisted	 this	 to	 stare	 at	 the	 men	 who	 sat	 about	 in	 groups grumbling	 in	 monotones	 and	 at	 two	 who	 complained	 loudly	 in	 a	 strange language	to	a	large,	poker-faced	man	leaning	over	the	counter. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a>All	this	will	remain	in	the	boy’s	mind	as	a	scene	from	some	mystery	drama,	for	a rough	voice	at	his	ear	said:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“How’d	you	get	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Startled,	 he	 looked	 at	 the	 speaker.	 He	 was	 almost	 twice	 Johnny’s	 size.	 And	 he had	help.	A	companion	stood	at	his	side.	Together	they	glared	at	the	boy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	walked	in,”	he	said	in	deliberate	tones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	walk	out	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	says	so?	This	is	Angelo’s	place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	may	be,	and	it	may	not.	Out	you	go!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seizing	the	boy	by	the	shoulder,	they	pushed	him	through	the	folding	doors	and, following,	gave	him	a	sudden	shove	and	a	vicious	kick	that	landed	him	outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	a	brutal	and	cowardly	act.	Unfortunately	for	the	perpetrator,	he	followed halfway	through	the	door.	Like	a	flash	of	light,	Johnny	was	on	his	feet.	The	next instant	his	left	arm	was	about	the	big	man’s	neck	with	a	vise-like	grip	that	both choked	and	silenced	him	in	one	act.	Next	Johnny’s	good	right	played	a	tattoo	on the	other’s	face.	He	went	down	like	a	log.	With	a	deft	twist,	Johnny	pitched	him into	the	river. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	in	time	he	caught	the	shadow	of	the	second	man	as	he	leaped	toward	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dropping	 like	 a	 deadfall,	 he	 stopped	 the	 headlong	 plunge	 of	 the	 man	 and	 sent him	to	join	his	pal	in	the	river	where	they	did	a	spluttering	act. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Coarse	lot!”	Johnny	grumbled.	“On	second	thought,	I’ll	not	stay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Climbing	the	stairs,	he	vanished	into	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	affair	was	to	linger	in	his	memory.	What	place	was	this?	What	were	those men	doing	there?	Some	were	grumbling,	some	smiling.	Why?	Was	this	Angelo’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">place?	 It	 couldn’t	 be.	 But	 it	 was	 beneath	 his	 flower	 store.	 Would	 he	 rent	 the space	to	such	men	if	he	knew	their	nature? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Naturally	he	wouldn’t,”	Johnny	assured	himself.	“I’ll	speak	to	him	about	it	next</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>time	I	see	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 resolve	 was	 never	 carried	 out.	 Before	 he	 chanced	 upon	 Angelo’s	 flower shop	again,	strange	discoveries	were	made.	These	discoveries	were	to	change	his entire	course	of	action. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a><b class="calibre4">CHAPTER	XX</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">RIDING	A	MOOSE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Red	Rodgers	raced	after	the	floating	figure	of	the	girl	he	gained	little	by	little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Boat	length	by	boat	length	he	decreased	the	distance.	Now	she	was	twenty	yards away,	now	ten,	now	five,	as	he	pulled	madly	at	the	oars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then,	as	he	glanced	over	his	shoulder	a	cry	of	surprise	and	dismay	escaped his	lips.	With	a	snort	and	a	mad	splashing	of	water	a	dark	bulk	sprang	from	the water,	 rattled	 over	 the	 pebbly	 shore,	 and	 then	 disappeared	 into	 the	 dense	 forest that	covered	the	narrow	island. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	one	full	minute	he	looked	in	vain	for	Berley	Todd.	Then,	catching	the	sound of	 what	 seemed	 a	 low	 laugh,	 he	 whirled	 about	 to	 find	 her	 two	 white	 hands clinging	to	the	prow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	give	me	a	hand!”	she	pleaded.	“I’m	soaked.	And	boo!	It’s	so	cold! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	always	wanted	to	do	it,”	she	chuckled	as	she	tumbled	into	the	boat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	what?”	Red	was	dumbfounded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ride	a	moose.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ride—a—moose?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure!	Didn’t	you	know	it	was	done?	Easy	enough.	All	you	have	to	do	is	to	find one	swimming	and	run	him	down	with	a	canoe	or	an	outboard	motor,	and	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">hop	overboard	and	seize	him	by	the	antlers.	As	long	as	he	is	in	the	water	he	can’t harm	you.	But	on	shore,	just	look	out! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That,”	she	added	quietly,	as	Red	once	more	swung	the	boat	about	and	rowed	for shore,	“was	Old	Uncle	Ned.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a>“Old	Uncle	Ned?	Oh,	yes,	you	spoke	of	him	once	before.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	huge,	and	is	quite	a	character	on	the	island.	Comes	coughing	around	timid ladies’	windows	at	night.”	She	laughed	quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	you	ran	into	him	he	must	have	been	feeding	on	grass	off	the	bottom.	He came	up	quick	and	pitched	me	out.	Somehow	I	was	thrown	on	top	of	him,	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">got	hold	of	his	antlers.	The	rest	was	too	good	to	lose,	so	I	just	hung	right	on	and took	a	ride. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hope,”	she	ended	quite	meekly,	“that	you	don’t	mind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“N-no.”	Red	was	rowing	hard.	“But	you’ll	be	frozen	before	we	reach	the	cabin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh-o	nn-o.”	The	girl	strove	in	vain	to	prevent	her	teeth	from	chattering.	“I-I’m all—all	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	instant	they	touched	the	dock	she	was	out	of	the	boat	and	on	the	dock	doing a	wild	dance.	She	stopped	suddenly	right	in	the	midst	of	this	to	stare	away	at	the black	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wha-what’s	moving	over	there?”	She	sank	away	into	the	shadows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	time	Red	could	discover	nothing.	Then	it	seemed	to	him	that	he	did	make out	something	moving	close	to	the	surface	of	the	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	may	be	a	boat.	Perhaps	we	had	better—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See!”	She	whispered	excitedly.	“It	 <i class="calibre3">is</i>	a	boat!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly	 a	 bright	 light	 shone	 across	 the	 water.	 A	 figure	 crouching	 behind	 the light	was	faintly	seen.	He	was	in	the	prow	of	a	boat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 now	 the	 thing	 within	 that	 circle	 of	 light	 caught	 and	 held	 their	 attention.	 A moose,	splendid	in	his	glory	of	shapely	body	and	wide-spreading	antlers,	stood at	the	point	of	the	island.	Apparently	blinded	by	the	light,	he	stood	there	like	a statue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	perfect!”	Red	breathed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a>“Monarch	of	the	forest!”	the	girl	whispered	low. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then	 stark	 tragedy	 came	 crashing	 across	 the	 waters.	 A	 high-power	 rifle roared.	The	moose	leaped	high	and	then	fell	with	a	splash	into	the	black	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	light	blinked	out,	and	again	all	was	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	if	to	escape	the	sight,	Berley	Todd	turned	and	glided	silently	up	the	hill.	She was	closely	followed	by	the	Red	Rover. </p>
<p class="calibre1">* 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 *</p>
<p class="calibre1">While	the	Red	Rover	and	Berley	Todd	were	meeting	with	strange	adventures	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 “Mystic	 Isle,”	 Drew	 Lane	 and	 his	 companions	 were	 striving	 in	 vain	 to unravel	the	tangled	skein	of	mystery	that	surrounded	their	disappearance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everything’s	 gone	 haywire!”	 Drew	 exclaimed	 disconsolately,	 thrusting	 out	 his feet	before	him	and	staring	moodily	at	his	littered	desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	so	bad	as	that,	I’m	sure,”	Johnny	Thompson	put	in	hopefully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	exactly	as	bad,	and	worse!”	Drew	struck	the	desk	a	blow	with	his	fist	that set	 even	 a	 “Meditating	 Buddha”	 dancing.	 “Why,	 look	 at	 it;	 we	 raid	 two	 well-known	 headquarters,	 and	 what	 do	 we	 get?	 A	 quart	 of	 pocket	 knives.	 The Galloping	Ghost	suggests	that	we	whittle	soft	wood	with	each	one	of	these,	then examine	 the	 cuttings	 for	 irregularities	 on	 the	 edge	 of	 the	 knife,	 after	 which	 we are	 to	 compare	 each	 with	 the	 shavings	 found	 on	 the	 night	 of	 the	 now	 famous kidnaping.	And	what	do	we	find?	Exactly	nothing.	The	whittling	was	not	done</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	any	one	of	these	knives.	So	back	they	go.	And	where	are	we?	Nowhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Chief’s	yelling	his	head	off.	People	are	saying	the	police	are	asleep.	Daily papers	 are	 impatient.	 University	 people	 are	 furious.	 The	 Red	 Rover	 is	 still	 a captive,	 and	 each	 day	 brings	 the	 great	 game	 nearer.	 Football!	 Why	 did	 anyone ever	invent	the	game?”	He	sprang	to	his	feet	and	began	pacing	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	did	they	kidnap	Red	anyway?”	he	demanded	fiercely.	“I	ask	you	that.	No</p>
<p class="calibre1">ransom	money	has	been	demanded.	Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps,”	suggested	Johnny,	“they	mean	to	wait	until	the	very	day	of	the	game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	may	figure	that	is	the	psychological	moment	for	making	a	demand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>“There	might	be	something	to	that,”	Drew	said	earnestly.	“Might	be	a	lot.	And	if there	is—”	Once	again	his	voice	rose.	“If	there	is,	we’ve	got	to	get	them	before that	time	comes!	Kidnaping’s	been	too	easy.	Too	many	soft-livered	millionaires have	paid	large	sums	for	their	release	or	the	release	of	some	child.	We’ve	got	to give	’em	a	lesson!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	how	are	you	to	get	them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	must	find	a	way.	There’s	still	that	invisible	footprint	on	the	sleeping	car	bed sheet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	there’s	my	jimmy	bar,”	said	Johnny	hopefully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	that’s	the	very	bar,	right	enough.	But	where	did	you	find	it?	In	the	speed boat	of	a	boy	in	his	’teens.	You	can’t	very	well	pin	a	super-kidnaping	on	a	mere boy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“N-no,”	Johnny	said	slowly,	“and	you	wouldn’t	want	to.	Young	Angelo	is	a	fine chap.	Good	looking,	and	all	that.	Got	everything—speed	boat—going	to	have	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">faster	one—big	car—going	to	college,	and	all	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	that?”	Drew	sat	up	and	stared	at	him.	“Didn’t	know	there	was	that	much	in the	 cut	 flower	 business,	 not	 these	 days.	 Flowers,	 you’d	 say,	 are	 a	 luxury.	 And luxuries	have	been	hit	hard.	Guess	I’ll	quit	being	a	cop,	and	go	in	for	flowers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	 thought	 of	 the	 rough	 reception	 accorded	 him	 in	 the	 place	 beneath	 the flower	shop,	and	wondered	a	big	wonder.	Should	he	tell	Drew	about	that?	Well, perhaps,	some	time.	Not	now.	He	hadn’t	quite	thought	the	thing	through	yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 the	 man	 with	 the	 scar	 and	 the	 fiery	 eyes!”	 he	 suggested.	 “You’ve	 got	 the goods	on	him.	That	was	his	gun.	He	fired	that	shot	at	Tom,	didn’t	he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	he	fired	the	shot.	But	he’s	vanished	off	the	earth,	so	far	as	we	can	see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 besides,”	 he	 added,	 pushing	 a	 sheet	 of	 paper	 toward	 the	 boy,	 “besides, there	is	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	old	G.G.	again!”	Johnny	said,	catching	his	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“None	other.	Read	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>Johnny	read:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Drew	Lane:	You	are	on	the	wrong	track.	The	man	who	fired	the	shot	was	not	the</i> <i class="calibre3">kidnaper.	For	his	motives	consult	the	Rogues’	Gallery.	The	trail	you	seek	leads</i> <i class="calibre3">north. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">The	G.G. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“North!”	Drew	exploded.	“How	far	north?	Which	way?	How?	By	train,	plane	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">boat?	If	he	wishes	to	help	us,	why	doesn’t	he	be	more	explicit?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps,”	suggested	Johnny,	“that’s	all	he	knows	at	present. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And,”	he	added	thoughtfully,	“we	ourselves	might	go	on	from	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	you	know,	in	the	newspaper	offices	they	have	what	they	call	an	Exchange Department.	 Papers	 from	 all	 over	 the	 world	 are	 on	 file	 there.	 If	 a	 fellow	 went there	 and	 studied	 all	 the	 papers	 published	 up	 north	 in	 Michigan,	 Wisconsin, Minnesota	 and	 Canada,	 he	 might	 discover	 a	 clue.	 Some	 paragraph	 telling	 of some	mysterious	occurrence	might	just	put	a	fellow	on	the	right	track.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	might.”	Drew’s	tone	was	dubious.	“Sounds	a	little	like	it	came	out	of	a	book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	you	go	ahead	and	try	it.	Jimmie	Drury	over	at	the	News	will	see	that	you	get a	look	at	the	files.	Tell	him	I	sent	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	while	you’re	on	the	ramble,	just	drop	over	to	the	State	Street	Station	and see	if	you	can	find	the	picture	of	a	crook	with	a	cross	branded	on	his	temple.	Old G.G.	suggested	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I’ll	tell	you	what	I	am	beginning	to	think	of	that	Galloping	Ghost!	I	think he’s	a	fake!	Or	even	worse,	a	crook	that’s	giving	us	a	bum	steer,	throwing	us	off the	trail.	I’ve	more	than	half	a	notion	to	burn	every	other	love	letter	he	sends	us before	I	read	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because,	 look!”	 Once	 more	 he	 was	 pacing	 the	 floor.	 “If	 an	 honest	 fellow	 was wearing	a	sheet	and	posing	as	a	ghost,	if	he	had	some	real	information	about	a</p>

<p class="calibre1">He	 broke	 straight	 off	 to	 stare	 at	 the	 door.	 Some	 one	 had	 begun	 rattling	 it violently. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">THE	SHOE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	 Rodgers	 and	 Berley	 Todd	 lost	 no	 time	 in	 making	 their	 way	 back	 to	 the scout’s	cabin.	If	those	men	who	blinded	and	shot	the	moose	were	the	kidnapers then	they	were	safest	under	the	protection	of	Ed’s	“shootin’	irons.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Those	 men,”	 Ed	 said,	 when	 he	 had	 heard	 their	 story,	 “more’n	 likely	 were	 not your	kidnapers	at	all.	Moose	hunters,	more’n	likely.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Moose	hunters!”	Berley	Todd	exploded.	“You’re	not	allowed	to	kill	a	moose	on Isle	Royale!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	 said	 you	 were?”	 Ed	 threw	 back	 his	 head	 and	 laughed.	 “They’re	 not allowed	to	kidnap	star	football	players	and	little	half-portions	like	you,	but	here you	are	all	the	same! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Case	is	not	parallel	though,”	he	added	thoughtfully.	“These	men	who	come	to the	 island	 for	 moose	 need	 the	 meat	 to	 feed	 their	 families;	 anyway	 that’s	 their excuse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 it’s	 good	 enough	 excuse	 for	 me!”	 he	 added	 emphatically.	 “I’m	 neither deputy	nor	game	warden.	I’m	here	to	guard	the	buildings	of	this	resort	from	fire and	theft.	If	I	interfere	with	these	moose	hunters	I’m	likely	to	be	found	cold	and stiff	under	the	snow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	it	is	a	shame!”	Berley	said	quietly.	“Moose	are	such	magnificent	creatures! </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	Isle	Royale	is	about	the	only	place	you	can	see	them.	Think	of	the	hundreds who	come	to	the	island	every	year	just	to	see	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Y-e-s,”	 Ed	 drawled,	 “I’ve	 thought	 of	 them	 and	 I’ve	 wondered	 why	 the	 moose are	not	protected	in	winter.	But	that	distinctly	ain’t	my	job.	So	there	you	are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a>“I’m	not	so	sure	those	men	were	not	members	of	the	kidnaping	band.	There	must be	batteries	and	spotlights	on	the	plane.	They	could	hook	those	up	and	use	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’ll	be	needing	meat.	Why	shouldn’t	they	hunt	moose?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Might	be,	but	I	doubt	it.”	Ed	stirred	the	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 oh!”	 exclaimed	 Berley	 Todd,	 as	 a	 sudden	 thought	 took	 possession	 of	 her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Suppose	those	were	moose	hunters.	Suppose	they	were	to	meet	the	kidnapers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suppose	 they	 think	 the	 kidnapers	 are	 wardens	 and	 deputies;	 and	 the	 kidnapers think	they’re	detectives	from	the	city.	Suppose	they	meet	and	shoot	it	out!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 then	 suppose	 we	 come	 upon	 them	 all	 dead	 with	 their	 boots	 on,”	 Red drawled.	“They	do	that	in	the	movies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ed,”	he	demanded,	“when	will	this	storm	end?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	day	after	to-morrow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	 stared	 angrily	 at	 the	 fire.	 The	 girl	 threw	 him	 a	 teasing	 glance	 as	 she	 sang low:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come,	play	with	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right!”	he	exclaimed	almost	fiercely,	“I’ll	play	with	you	to-morrow	and	the day	after	if	need	be;	anyway	until	the	kidnapers	catch	up	with	us	or	we	are	able to	leave	the	island.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you	care	to	row,”	Ed	suggested,	“it’s	not	too	rough	in	the	harbor.	If	you	were to	wear	my	canvas	coat	and	cowboy	hat—”	He	turned	to	Red.	“If	you	went	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	dawn	and	if	Berley,	here,	sat	low	in	the	stern,	no	one	would	know	but	that it	was	just	old	Ed	and	his	dog.	You	could	play	around	among	the	little	islands	all day	and	be	safe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shall	we?”	Berley’s	tone	was	almost	wistful.	“We’ll	take	a	lunch	and	eat	it	on the	rocks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Might	be	worse,”	Red	admitted.	“Rowing	will	at	least	keep	me	in	trim	for	the great	day.	And	now	for	some	sleep!”	He	disappeared	behind	the	narrow	curtain that	led	to	one	of	the	cubby-hole	bedrooms	in	Ed’s	cabin. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a>“The	great	day,”	he	whispered	to	himself,	as	he	slid	beneath	the	covers.	That	day now	 seemed	 very,	 very	 far	 away.	 But	 quite	 unconsciously	 he	 was	 losing	 his feeling	of	long	weariness.	The	spring	of	youth	was	flooding	back	through	every nerve	and	fiber	of	his	being.	“If	only	I	could	get	a	whack	at	that	line,”	he	thought dreamily.	“If	only	I	could!” </p>

<p class="calibre1">The	person	banging	at	Drew	Lane’s	door	was	none	other	than	the	person	known</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 the	 Rat.	 Drew	 was	 surprised	 to	 see	 him.	 The	 Rat,	 like	 others	 of	 his	 kind, seldom	 appeared	 unless	 called.	 The	 object	 he	 unwrapped	 before	 the	 young detective’s	 astonished	 eyes	 was,	 he	 thought,	 worth	 a	 trip	 half	 way	 round	 the world.	It	was	the	shoe	that	had	made	the	invisible	footprint	on	the	sleeping	car sheet.	Once	Drew’s	eyes	fell	upon	it,	he	sat	and	stared.	A	full	minute	had	passed into	eternity	before	he	could	say:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	did	you	find	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 know	 dat	 place	 beside	 de	 river?	 Down	 below	 de	 flower	 shop?	 Angelo Piccalo’s	shop?	Dat’s	de	place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drew	looked	at	Johnny.	Johnny	looked	at	Drew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rat,”	said	Drew,	“you’re	a	great	old	finder.	Here’s	a	fiver.	Now	scram!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Rat	vanished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	long	time	the	detective	and	his	young	friend	sat	staring	at	the	shoe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Johnny,”	said	Drew	at	last,	“they	say	you	can’t	keep	birds	from	flying	over	your head,	but	you	can	prevent	their	building	nests	in	your	hair.	Also,	‘Where	there	is much	 smoke	 there	 must	 be	 some	 fire.’	 First	 there’s	 the	 jimmy	 bar,	 and	 now there’s	this	shoe.	Looks	as	if	we	were	beginning	to	see	light.	Do	you	get	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I—I	think	I	do,”	replied	Johnny,	in	anything	but	a	cheerful	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	was	on	his	way	early	next	morning.	He	crossed	the	bridge	and	was	about to	pass	the	flower	shop	without	going	in,	when	Angelo	stepped	out	of	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gooda	morning,	meester	Johnny!	Dees	ees	one—a	fine	morning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a>“Yes,	sure,	Angelo,	it	is	fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently	 a	 box	 had	 been	 opened	 beside	 the	 flower	 shop	 door.	 The	 box	 was gone,	 but	 some	 broken	 fragments	 of	 wood	 remained.	 Picking	 up	 one	 of	 these, Angelo	began	to	whittle	absent-mindedly.	His	actions	so	fascinated	the	boy	that he	found	it	hard	to	talk	coherently.	However,	he	forced	himself	into	the	task	of talking	 about	 the	 weather,	 the	 river,	 speed	 boats	 and	 rare	 flowers.	 In	 the meantime	he	watched	the	keen	blade	of	Angelo’s	knife	chipping	out	short,	sharp shavings	of	wood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	nervous.	His	fingers	tremble,”	he	told	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 customer	 appeared.	 Angelo	 went	 inside.	 After	 a	 furtive	 glance,	 Johnny	 bent over,	seized	a	handful	of	Angelo’s	shavings,	then	hurried	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	block	down	the	street	he	paused	to	drop	the	shavings	into	a	used	envelope	and thrust	 them	 into	 the	 side	 pocket	 of	 his	 coat.	 “Exhibit	 A,”	 he	 murmured	 as	 he marched	 on	 toward	 the	 office	 of	 the	 News	 where	 he	 was	 to	 study	 Exchanges. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">ON	THE	“SLEEPING	LION” </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 morning,	 in	 the	 ghostly	 hour	 just	 before	 dawn,	 Red	 Rodgers	 and	 Berley Todd	crept	out	into	the	frosty	air	of	Isle	Royale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To-day,”	the	girl	whispered,	“we	are	to	play.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 yet,	 as	 she	 stood	 upon	 the	 rocks	 watching	 the	 waves	 that,	 now	 roaring	 as they	 rose,	 now	 whispering	 as	 they	 fell,	 broke	 upon	 those	 rugged	 shores,	 she seemed	to	see	beneath	their	surface	grim	black	hands	stretching	out	to	grasp	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 strange,	 those	 black	 waters	 in	 the	 eerie	 hour	 before	 dawn.	 Even	 the staunch	young	athlete	felt	it	and	was	silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	stout	oars	were	in	their	hands,	however,	all	was	changed.	To	feel	the	rise and	 fall	 of	 the	 boat,	 to	 skim	 the	 crests	 of	 waves,	 to	 catch	 the	 rhythmic	 rowing that,	like	a	song	in	the	night,	seemed	to	lift	them	and	bear	them	down—this	was life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	 she	 can	 row!”	 Red	 told	 himself,	 as	 he	 felt	 the	 push	 of	 her	 oars	 send	 the boat	along. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	the	time	comes,”	he	said	aloud,	“we	will	make	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	the	girl	replied,	“but	the	time	is	not	to-day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	she	spoke	the	truth	Red	was	soon	enough	to	know.	In	the	sheltered	channel of	 Rock	 Harbor	 the	 waves	 were	 mere	 rushing	 ripples	 of	 foam.	 But	 once	 they came	to	a	gap	between	two	small	islands	that	looked	out	into	the	open	sea,	great swells	caught	their	frail	craft	and,	tossing	it	back,	flecked	them	with	foam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	voice	of	many	waters.”	In	the	girl’s	tone	there	was	a	touch	of	awe.	“In	that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a>storm,	on	the	open	lake,	no	small	boat	could	live.	To-morrow	we	play.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Surrendering	himself	to	the	will	of	the	elements,	Red	Rodgers	played.	But	even as	they	sent	their	boat	gliding	along	to	the	time	of	a	song,	as	they	climbed	some rocky	ledge	to	stand	breathless	looking	off	at	the	storm-tossed	waters,	or	fought their	way	forward	through	masses	of	tangled	vegetation	to	some	crag	where	they might	find	a	broader	view,	he	whispered	to	himself:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	keeping	fit.	Even	this	is	training	for	the	day	that	is	to	come.”	And	then,	as his	mind	sobered,	he	wondered:	“Will	that	day	ever	come?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	noon	they	built	a	fire	on	a	tiny	beach	and	brewed	coffee.	They	ate	their	lunch in	 silence.	 There	 was	 that	 about	 this	 day	 of	 storm	 which	 made	 silence	 seem	 a mood	to	prize. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	as	the	sun	was	sinking	in	the	west,	they	turned	the	prow	of	their	boat	into	a narrow	 opening,	 then	 shot	 her	 squarely	 into	 the	 teeth	 of	 a	 storm.	 Throwing	 all the	force	of	their	perfect	bodies	into	the	business	of	rowing,	they	conquered	one gigantic	wave,	another,	another,	and	yet	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	boat	was	but	a	cork	in	the	midst	of	a	great	ocean,	yet	they	dared	accept	the wild	waves’	challenge.	Again,	again,	and	yet	again,	they	fought	their	way	up	and over,	up	and	over	until	they	were	twenty	boat-lengths	out	to	sea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	 with	 a	 laugh	 that	 was	 good	 to	 hear,	 Red	 swung	 the	 boat	 about	 and	 they went	riding	the	waves	back	to	shelter	and	safety. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That,”	he	breathed,	“is	life—life—life!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five	minutes	later	they	lay	upon	a	bed	of	moss	at	the	back	of	a	tiny	island	known as	 “Sleeping	 Lion”	 because	 of	 the	 mane-like	 crest	 of	 bushes	 that	 crowns	 its ridge,	watching	the	blue-black	waters	turn	to	the	silvery	gray	of	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Never	had	the	boy	witnessed	such	a	sight.	Starting	at	the	rocks	nearest	them,	the spray	 moved	 along	 the	 island	 shores.	 And	 every	 separate	 spray	 seemed	 a	 light that	flashed	with	one	white	gleam,	then	faded	into	darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Old	Father	Superior	is	lighting	his	lamps,”	the	girl	whispered.	Once	again	there was	awe	in	her	tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a>So	they	lingered	on	the	“Sleeping	Lion”	until	the	afterglow	had	faded	and	Father Superior’s	lamps	were	lost	in	the	shades	of	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	the	girl	who	at	last	broke	the	silence.	“See!”	She	spoke	in	a	voice	that	was mellow	as	the	tones	of	a	cello.	“See!	The	light	that	beckons!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Red	looked	away	across	the	surging	sea	he	caught	the	gleam	of	a	lamp	that, winking	and	blinking,	cast	its	beams	from	afar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Passage	Island	light,”	he	murmured	huskily.	“The	light	that	shall	guide	us safely	when	the	time	comes.	But	to-night—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To-night	we	dare	not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rising	 as	 if	 to	 break	 the	 spell	 that	 had	 been	 cast	 upon	 her,	 Berley	 Todd	 went whirling	through	a	wild	dance.	A	weird	place	for	a	dance.	Sea	gulls,	wakened	by this	 sudden	 commotion,	 circled	 aloft	 screaming.	 The	 very	 waves	 appeared	 to lapse	into	silence,	a	silence	that	was	to	be	broken	at	once	by	such	a	mad	onrush as	threatened	to	seize	her	and	drag	her	away	into	waters	as	black	as	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come!”	she	cried.	“We	must	go!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shoving	 their	 boat	 off	 the	 rocks,	 they	 paddled	 silently	 back	 to	 the	 island	 shore where,	 after	 concealing	 their	 boat,	 they	 made	 their	 way	 cautiously	 through	 the spruce	trees	to	Ed’s	cabin,	and	one	more	steaming	bowl	of	Mulligan	stew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	day,	however,	was	not	over.	Wild	adventures	awaited	them	in	the	night. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">A	VISIT	IN	THE	NIGHT</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Johnny	Thompson	returned	to	Drew	Lane’s	room	in	the	early	evening	of	that day,	he	found	himself	now	in	a	mood	of	high	exaltation	and	now	in	one	of	deep depression.	 He	 felt	 that	 he	 had,	 half	 by	 good	 fortune	 and	 half	 by	 earnest endeavor,	come	close	to	the	solution	of	a	crime	that	had	filled	the	front	pages	of the	nation’s	press	for	days.	At	the	same	time	he	found	the	accusing	hand	of	Fate pointing	straight	at	a	friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	 Johnny	 friendship	 was	 a	 sacred	 thing.	 He	 worshiped	 often	 at	 the	 altar	 of friendship.	To	his	friends	he	gave	his	utmost	in	loyalty	and	devotion.	Never	until now	had	he	asked	himself	the	question:	“What	am	I	to	do	if	one	of	these	friends proves	 unworthy	 of	 this	 loyalty	 and	 devotion?”	 There	 had	 been	 no	 need.	 But now—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	 the	 matter	 of	 the	 jimmy	 bar	 found	 in	 the	 speed	 boat,”	 he	 told	 himself gloomily.	“There	is	the	shoe	that	made	the	invisible	footprint	on	the	sheet.	There is	the	wrist-watch	band	studded	with	green	stones	from	Isle	Royale.	There	is	that place	down	by	the	river	front	from	which	I	was	ejected.	Ejected!”	He	chuckled at	this.	They	had	put	him	out	of	the	place,	right	enough.	But	he	had	done	plenty to	them	after	that,	those	two	bouncers.	“Yes,”	he	sighed,	“it	sure	looks	bad!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	relieved	to	find	that	both	Drew	and	Tom	were	away.	Letting	himself	in by	a	key	Drew	had	given	him,	he	dropped	into	a	chair	and	for	a	full	half	hour	sat there	alone	in	the	dark,	thinking;	and	those	were	long,	long	thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“After	all,”	he	sighed,	as	at	last	he	sat	up	in	his	chair,	“one’s	first	duty	is	to	his nation	and	her	laws,	to	the	whole	community	and	not	to	one	individual	who	has gone	wrong.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 this	 he	 switched	 on	 a	 light	 and	 began	 to	 write.	 When	 he	 had	 finished	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>placed	on	Drew	Lane’s	desk	a	concise	statement	of	all	that	had	come	under	his observation	 regarding	 the	 kidnaping	 of	 the	 Red	 Rover.	 To	 this	 he	 attached	 a single	newspaper	clipping.	He	had	found	this	after	hours	of	search	in	a	humble sheet	 which	 bore	 the	 name	 “Mining	 Gazette.”	 This	 paper	 was	 published	 in	 a small	city	far	up	on	the	North	Peninsula	of	Michigan.	The	clipping	read:</p>
<p class="calibre1">MYSTERIOUS	PLANE	HEARD	OVER	ISLE	ROYALE</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Pierre	LeBlanc,	the	head	lighthouse	keeper	on	Passage	Island,	four	miles	off	Isle</i> <i class="calibre3">Royale,	reports	by	radio	this	morning	that	late	in	the	night	he	heard	the	drum	of</i> <i class="calibre3">an	 airplane	 motor	 in	 the	 direction	 of	 Isle	 Royale.	 It	 is	 his	 belief	 that	 the	 plane</i> <i class="calibre3">landed	in	one	of	the	bays	or	harbors	of	the	island.	Whether	it	took	off	later,	he</i> <i class="calibre3">was	unable	to	tell. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Since	the	only	persons	on	the	island	are	a	fisherman	or	two	and	a	care-taker	at</i> <i class="calibre3">Rock	 Harbor	 Lodge,	 the	 reason	 for	 this	 mysterious	 landing	 will	 not	 soon	 be</i> <i class="calibre3">known. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Drew,”	 Johnny	 wrote	 after	 pinning	 the	 clipping	 to	 a	 sheet	 of	 paper,	 “this newspaper	 was	 printed	 the	 day	 after	 the	 Red	 Rover’s	 disappearance.	 I	 have stated	all	the	facts	as	I	have	them,	and	leave	you	to	draw	your	own	conclusions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here	also	is	an	envelope	containing	some	shavings.	Have	Tom	examine	them. </p>

<p class="calibre1">After	scribbling	“Johnny”	after	this	note,	he	dropped	a	paper	weight	on	it,	pulled his	cap	down	over	his	eyes,	caught	an	elevator	and	was	soon	out	in	the	cool	air of	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">* 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 *</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wonder!”	There	was	a	look	of	longing	in	Berley’s	eyes	as	she	stared	at	Ed’s half	burned	out	fire.	“Wonder	if	we	dare	venture	out	into	the	night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a>“Why?”	The	scout	shot	her	a	glance. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“It	would	be	fine	if	Red	could	see	it.

<p class="calibre1">She	 was	 singing	 softly	 now:	 “Good	 old	 summer	 time.	 Will	 you	 come	 and	 play with	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	grinned	in	spite	of	himself.	Then	his	face	sobered	as	he	replied	huskily:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps—if	summer	ever	comes	again	for	you	and	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	not	forgotten,	would	not	forget	as	long	as	they	were	on	the	island,	that they	were	escaped	victims	of	kidnapers,	that	those	men	were	still	about	and	that he	carried	in	his	pocket	the	magneto	parts	that	would	keep	them	from	escaping from	the	island. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why	 did	 he	 not	 cast	 these	 bits	 of	 metal	 into	 the	 lake	 where	 water	 is	 deep? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because	he	had	hopes,	rather	wild	hopes,	but	hopes	all	the	same,	that	some	one would	arrive	at	the	island	who	could	pilot	that	powerful	plane.	He	could	not.	Ed could	not,	but	there	were	many	who	could.	So	he	clung	to	his	hopes	and	to	the magneto	parts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come!”	said	Berley	Todd,	snuffing	out	the	candle.	“Come	with	me	to	the	place where	I	have	always	found	happiness—my	summer	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Obeying	her	command,	Ed	strapped	on	one	“shootin’	iron,”	handed	the	other	to the	young	football	star,	and	then	led	the	way	out	into	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	darkness	at	this	moment	was	complete.	Later	there	was	to	be	a	moon,	a	fact long	to	be	remembered.	With	the	unerring	instinct	of	a	woodsman,	the	scout	led the	way	over	the	winding	path.	Berley	and	Red	followed	silently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 were	 sounds	 in	 that	 night	 of	 darkness.	 Off	 to	 the	 right	 the	 snapping	 of	 a twig	sounded	like	the	report	of	a	gun. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a>“Probably	Old	Uncle	Ned,”	the	girl	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then,	from	Ed:	“Here	we	are.	Now	for	the	key.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Up	a	tall	flight	of	stairs	they	tiptoed.	Next	moment	they	were	inside	some	place that	seemed	vast	and	silent	in	that	darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Berley	moved	about.	There	were	sounds	of	shades	being	drawn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	match	flared.	Shavings	on	the	hearth	blazed	up.	Soon	a	great	fire	on	the	wide hearth	was	burning	freely	and	the	place	was	as	light	as	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 were	 safe	 enough	 for	 all	 that.	 The	 massive	 door	 was	 locked	 and	 barred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	windows	were	high	from	the	ground,	and	all	were	shaded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	took	the	place	in	with	one	sweeping	glance.	The	fireplace	was	immense.	Up from	this	ran	a	wide	chimney	covered	by	a	curious	rug	woven	by	Indians. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	 the	 fire	 were	 wide-seated,	 comfortable	 chairs.	 On	 the	 mantel	 stood	 a rustic	 clock	 made	 of	 birchwood.	 Berley	 set	 this	 going.	 Its	 cheerful	 tick-tock, tick-tock	filled	the	silent	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Berley	stole	a	glance	at	the	young	football	star	she	read	approval	in	his	eyes, and	was	satisfied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Makes	you	think	of	those	places	you	read	about	in	English	history.”	His	smile was	good	to	see.	“There	should	be	a	whole	quarter	of	beef	roasting	over	the	fire, spears	and	armor	hanging	on	the	walls,	the	head	of	a	wild	boar	above	the	mantel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	after	all	it’s	great	just	as	it	is.	I	only	wish	we	were	here	under	more	happy circumstances.”	He	dropped	into	the	chair	farthest	from	the	blazing	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	safe	enough	for	the	present,	at	least,”	said	Ed,	lighting	his	pipe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Berley	 Todd	 sent	 him	 a	 smile	 of	 gratitude.	 It	 was	 evident	 that	 for	 one	 short evening	she	wished	to	feel	safe	and	quite	at	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>Our	 minds	 are	 strange.	 One	 moment	 we	 may	 be	 in	 the	 dark,	 surrounded,	 we imagine,	by	hostile	foes.	Our	minds	are	filled	with	all	sorts	of	forebodings.	The next	we	are	before	a	blazing	fire	in	our	own	home	where	we	have	known	peace, and	presto!	all	is	changed;	fear	goes,	peace	comes,	we	know	not	how. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	glad	you	like	it.”	Berley	Todd	spoke	as	one	in	a	dream.	“When	I	think	of the	 good	 times	 we	 have	 had	 here,	 and	 of	 the	 trips	 we	 have	 planned	 before	 this fire!	How	good	it	all	was!”	Her	voice	trailed	off	to	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	saw	from	the	look	on	her	face	that	she	was	thinking:	“Oh,	bury	me	not	on the	lone	prairee.”	He	wished	she	might	forget	entirely	for	one	short	hour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	me	about	it,	those	other	days.”	There	was	an	unaccustomed	gentleness	in his	tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Those	golden	days?”	Her	face	brightened.	“How	we	would	sit	here	planning	by the	 fire!	 ‘To-morrow	 we	 will	 round	 the	 Point	 in	 the	 little	 boat	 and	 go	 far	 back into	Tobin’s	Harbor;	back	to	Talman’s	Island.	There	are	wild	raspberries	growing round	that	cabin.	And	some	great	old	speckled	trout	lie	in	the	rocks	nearby.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Talman’s	 Island!”	 Her	 voice	 changed.	 It	 was	 shot	 through	 with	 fear	 and	 pain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 is	 the	 island	 where	 they	 were	 holding	 us	 prisoners,	 you	 and	 I.	 There’s another	 little	 island	 close	 by	 where	 they	 stayed	 themselves	 in	 a	 tumble-down cabin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	me,”	again	the	girl	changed	the	subject,	“how	did	they	come	to	get	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Took	me	in	my	sleep.	Rolled	me	up	in	my	blankets	on	the	Pullman	and	shoved</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	through	the	window.	I	went	to	sleep	waiting	for	the	train	to	move	up	and	pick up	the	rest	of	the	squad.	Carried	me	down	the	river	in	the	speed	boat,	then	over to	some	place	where	they	put	me	on	the	plane.	Then,	thunder	through	the	night, the	roar	of	motors,	and	there	I	was	in	that	cabin,	there	on	the	island. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	all	absurdly	simple,”	she	sighed.	“One	can’t	be	rich	and	happy,	it	seems, these	days.	Perhaps	no	one	should	wish	to	be.	I	don’t	know.”	There	was	a	world of	questioning	in	her	tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our	home	is	large.	The	grounds	that	surround	it	are	broad.	I	loved	to	walk	there</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>in	the	moonlight	alone.	Had	I	been	the	cook	or	the	maid,	I	might	have	walked	in peace.	But	the	daughter—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	two	men	seized	me	one	night	and	carried	me	away	in	a	car.	I	kicked	out and	bit	and	tried	to	scream.	It	did	no	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	paused	as	if	exhausted	by	the	very	thought	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	brought	me	up	here,”	she	began	again,	after	a	time.	“Just	as	they	did	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	been	in	that	little	pen	of	logs	a	whole	day	before	they	brought	you.	It—it was	rather	terrible.	But	by	and	by	it	came	to	me	that	I	was	on	Isle	Royale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	 you	 know,”	 a	 faint	 smile	 played	 about	 her	 lips,	 “if	 I	 must	 leave	 this gloriously	beautiful	world,	which	of	course	some	time	I	must,	I’d	sort	of	like	to be	on	Isle	Royale	when	that	day	comes.	It	wouldn’t	be	so	hard,	the	parting.	And somehow	I	feel	that,	after	all,	it’s	just	passing	from	beauty	to	more	beauty.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	long	time	after	that	there	was	silence	in	the	room.	Only	the	ceaseless	rush of	 waters	 on	 the	 shore,	 and	 the	 friendly	 tick-tock	 of	 the	 clock	 disturbed	 the stillness	of	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	wanted	you	to	sign	a	paper,”	Red	suggested	after	a	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	kidnapers?	Yes,	they	did.	Wanted	me	to	say	I	was	in	great	distress.	Wanted me	 to	 beg	 my	 father	 to	 give	 them	 money,	 twenty	 thousand	 dollars,	 to	 save	 my life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you	wouldn’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.”	 Her	 big	 blue	 eyes	 shone	 with	 a	 new	 light.	 “Why	 should	 I?	 They	 are outlaws	 of	 the	 worst	 type.	 If	 I	 had	 done	 what	 they	 wished	 I	 would	 have	 been helping	 them.	 I	 have	 not	 much	 strength.	 I	 have	 a	 little.	 If	 they	 get	 my	 father’s money	they	will	be	encouraged,	will	go	on	with	their	terrible	business.	They	will take	some	one	far	weaker	than	I,	a	defenseless	baby,	perhaps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some	 time	 one	 must	 die.”	 Her	 eyes	 were	 large	 and	 round.	 “Why	 not	 now,	 if need	be,	and	for	a	good	cause?	If	they	catch	me	again	and	put	an	end	to	me,	my father	 will	 spend	 his	 fortune	 hunting	 them	 down.	 What	 finer	 tribute	 could	 one have	to	one’s	memory?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a>“What	 indeed?”	 Red’s	 eyes	 shone	 with	 true	 admiration.	 “But	 they’ll	 not	 get you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Berley	Todd	did	not	reply.	Instead	she	rose	and	began	walking	slowly	back	and forth	in	the	large	room.	She	was	humming,	and	the	words	were	these:	“Oh,	bury me	not	on	the	lone	prairee.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,”	 said	 the	 boy	 with	 a	 laugh	 that	 came	 perilously	 near	 being	 a	 sob,	 “it’s time	we	were	going	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a><b class="calibre4">CHAPTER	XXIV</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">UNCLE	NED	DOES	HIS	BIT</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 moon	 was	 out	 when	 they	 took	 the	 trail	 that	 led	 to	 Ed’s	 cabin.	 By	 moving along	single	file	in	the	shadows	they	were	able	to	keep	themselves	concealed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 had	 covered	 more	 than	 half	 the	 distance	 to	 the	 cabin	 when	 of	 a	 sudden Berley,	who	was	in	the	lead,	stopped	short	to	press	her	companions	back	into	the deeper	shadows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some—some	one	skulking	about	the	cabin!”	she	whispered	tensely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	there	he	was.	There	could	be	no	doubt	about	it.	The	moon,	skirting	a	corner of	their	cabin,	left	there	for	a	space	of	seconds	the	wavering	shadow	of	a	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ten	seconds	passed,	and	the	shadow	vanished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do—do	you	think	it’s	the	kidnapers?”	Despite	her	bravest	efforts	the	girl	could not	prevent	her	teeth	from	chattering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	know	who	it	is,”	the	scout	grumbled	in	a	hoarse	whisper.	“Only	one	way to	deal	with	a	skulker.	Go	after	him! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look!”	He	turned	to	Red.	“In	another	moment	a	cloud	will	be	over	the	moon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only	 a	 small	 cloud.	 Soon	 pass.	 But	 time	 enough.	 When	 it	 gets	 dark,	 you	 go scooting	down	the	Tobin’s	Harbor	trail.	He	went	that	way.	Go	down	two	hundred feet	 or	 more,	 then	 drop	 off	 into	 the	 bush.	 I’ll	 go	 round	 the	 cabin	 and	 come	 in from	the	left.	When	the	moon	comes	out	I’ll	flush	him	some	way.	After	that	the best	man	wins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You—you’d	better	stay	here,”	he	said	to	Berley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Berley	did	not	stay	there.	As	Red	went	skulking	down	that	trail	in	the	dark,	she followed.	 She	 was	 afraid,	 but	 being	 in	 the	 darkness	 alone	 with	 prowlers	 about, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>who	might	carry	her	away,	was	worse	than	being	on	the	firing	line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Obeying	 instructions,	 Red	 followed	 the	 trail	 a	 hundred	 paces	 or	 less,	 then dropped	away	into	the	shadows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finding	a	place	where	the	moss	grew	thick	before	a	great	rock,	he	drew	the	girl down	 beside	 him.	 “Really	 there’s	 no	 reason	 to	 be	 excited.”	 He	 felt	 her	 heart’s wild	 beating.	 “Probably	 we’ll	 not	 see	 him	 again	 this	 night.	 He’s	 just	 scouting around	to	see	who’s	here.	Not	likely	to	find	out	much.	He—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 girl’s	 hand	 pressed	 hard	 on	 his	 arm.	 Off	 to	 the	 left	 there	 was	 a	 sound	 of movement.	And	then	the	moon	came	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instantly	 from	 the	 bush	 an	 automatic	 barked.	 The	 shot	 had	 been	 fired	 at	 the scout.	He	dropped—not	with	a	bullet	wound,	for	the	rascal	had	missed—but	for the	 purpose	 of	 securing	 a	 safe	 position	 and	 waiting	 his	 turn.	 It	 had	 been	 many years	since	any	one	had	presumed	to	shoot	at	this	scout;	years	of	peace	they	had been,	 and	 now	 this,	 a	 shot	 in	 the	 night.	 His	 mighty	 “shootin’	 iron”	 roared	 its reply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	thing	that	happened	after	that	will	never	be	fully	credited	by	either	Red	or the	girl,	and	that	in	spite	of	the	fact	that	they	saw	it	with	their	own	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	moon	was	out	in	all	its	glory.	From	their	observation	post	before	the	great rock	they	thought	they	made	out	a	skulking	figure	off	to	the	right	and	not	far	off the	Tobin’s	Harbor	trail.	At	the	same	time	they	caught	a	sound	of	movement	still further	back	in	the	bush. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	are	more,	perhaps	three	or	four	of	them.”	Berley	pressed	Red’s	arm	hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They—they’re	trying	to	surround	us!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	 wrong	 she	 was	 they	 were	 soon	 enough	 to	 know,	 for	 the	 skulking	 figure, having	 come	 to	 rest,	 lifted	 his	 head	 so	 far	 above	 the	 thimbleberry	 bushes	 as	 to leave	it	in	clear	view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That—”	 Red’s	 voice	 was	 a	 bit	 unsteady.	 “That’s	 one	 of	 them.	 Sha-shall	 I shoot?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	no.	That	one	in	the	bushes	will	get	you	if	you	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a>Then	astonishing	things	began	to	happen.	The	man	on	the	moonlit	trail	lifted	his gun,	took	quick	aim	and	fired,	not	at	the	scout,	not	at	Red,	but	at	the	moving	spot in	the	bushes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instantly	 from	 out	 those	 bushes	 came	 a	 charging	 terror.	 All	 legs	 and	 head	 and saber-pointed	 antlers,	 he	 came	 straight	 at	 the	 offender	 who	 had	 fired	 that	 last shot.	Old	Uncle	Ned,	veteran	bull	moose	of	Isle	Royale,	had	beyond	doubt	been nicked	by	a	bullet.	Revenge	he	would	have,	and	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	sight	of	him	the	terrified	gangster	leaped	high	in	air	to	clear	the	bushes.	He was	caught	squarely	by	those	murderous	antlers.	Then	moose	and	man	plunged</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward	into	the	dark	clump	of	evergreen	growing	by	the	trail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 came	 the	 sound	 of	 crashing	 boards,	 followed	 by	 the	 hoarse	 breathing	 of some	creature	engaged	in	a	life	and	death	struggle.	There	were	many	seconds	of this	 and	 then,	 staggering	 like	 a	 drunken	 man,	 Old	 Uncle	 Ned	 came	 out	 to	 the trail	and	went	slowly	plodding	his	way	into	the	distant	dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 waited	 for	 the	 man	 to	 appear.	 A	 moment	 ticked	 its	 way	 into	 eternity,	 a second	and	a	third.	From	far	away	came	the	maniacal	laugh	of	a	loon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Red,”	the	girl	whispered	at	last,	“did	you	hear	that	cracking	sound?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	What	was	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Red,	do	you	know	what	there	is	by	that	clump	of	black	trees?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	What	is	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Red,	can	you	guess	what	has	happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.”	Red	was	very	patient.	“What	has	happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Red,”	 she	 drew	 a	 long	 breath,	 “Red,	 there	 is	 a	 hole,	 a	 very	 deep	 hole,	 ninety feet	 they	 say,	 at	 the	 edge	 of	 that	 clump	 of	 black	 trees.	 It’s	 an	 old	 mine,	 almost full	of	water,	green	slimy	water.	There—there	was	a	fence	around	it,	a	very	poor fence.	Old	Uncle	Ned	pushed	the	man	in	there!	He—he	fell	part	way	in,	Uncle</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ned	did,	but	he	came	out	again.	The	man	did	not	come	out.	He	will	never	come out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a>“Is—is	that	true?”	Red	half	rose	on	one	elbow.	“Then	we	must	try	to	save	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s	bad.	But	he’s	a	man.	Can’t	let	a	man	die	that	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	went	creeping	away	in	the	shadows.	The	girl	followed.	When	they	reached</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	edge	of	the	clump	of	trees	they	found	the	scout	flat	on	his	stomach,	flashing a	light	into	the	dark	hole	that	had	once	been	a	copper	mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gone,	 I	 guess,”	 he	 said	 in	 a	 very	 even	 tone.	 “His	 cap	 is	 floating	 down	 there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	bubbles	came	up,	but	he—he	hasn’t	come.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	squatted	down	beside	him.	The	girl	stood	looking	down.	For	five	minutes, like	figures	posed	for	a	piece	of	statuary,	they	held	their	positions.	Then,	as	he rose	stiffly,	the	scout	said:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gone,	all	right	enough!”	Then	in	a	tone	that	was	like	a	church	bell	tolling	in	the night:	“He	was	bad,	probably	all	through;	but	for	all	that	he	was	a	man.	It’s	our duty	to	ask	peace	on	his	soul.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 a	 moment	 their	 heads	 were	 bowed	 in	 silent	 prayer.	 Then,	 like	 a	 squad	 that has	 fired	 a	 salute	 over	 a	 comrade’s	 grave,	 they	 right-about-faced	 and	 marched solemnly	away	into	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 scout	 led	 the	 way	 in	 silence	 back	 to	 the	 cabin.	 He	 did	 not	 stop	 there,	 but marched	 straight	 on.	 The	 others,	 not	 a	 little	 puzzled	 at	 his	 actions,	 paused	 and then	 followed.	 Before	 a	 stone	 slab	 standing	 out	 black	 in	 the	 uncertain	 light,	 he paused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That,”	he	said,	“marks	the	grave	of	an	honest	man,	a	copper	miner.	No	word	is inscribed	on	that	stone,	yet	the	fact	that	he	worked	as	a	miner	marks	him	as	one who	at	least	was	willing	to	labor	for	his	bread. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	seems	a	little	strange,”	there	was	a	curious	huskiness	in	his	voice,	“that	more than	fifty	years	ago	this	one,	whom	his	comrades	honored	with	a	marked	grave, should	have	labored	to	dig	that	deep	hole	in	the	earth	that,	never	a	success	as	a mine,	has	now	become	a	grave	for	one	who	deserved	little	honor.	Sort	of	seems to	prove	that	no	man	labors	in	vain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having	 delivered	 this	 simple	 sermon,	 he	 turned	 and	 led	 the	 way	 back	 to	 the cabin. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>A	 few	 moments	 later	 he	 left	 once	 more	 to	 return	 with	 a	 heavy	 object	 in	 his hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here.	Take	this,”	he	said	to	Red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	reached	out	for	the	thing,	sank	forward,	all	but	dropped	it,	then	exclaimed:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whew!	How	heavy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Native	 copper,”	 said	 Ed	 with	 a	 smile.	 “Taken	 from	 the	 earth	 when	 the foundation	for	the	lodge	was	laid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks	as	if	it	had	been	melted,”	said	Red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Probably	 was,	 before	 man	 came	 upon	 the	 earth.	 Float	 copper,	 they	 call	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indians	mined	it	on	Isle	Royale	many	generations	before	the	white	men	came.	It was	a	prized	possession.	Spear	points,	arrow	points,	skinning	knives,	knives	for fighting	could	be	made	from	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	why	are	there	no	mines	here	now?”	Red	had	visions	of	becoming	a	pioneer copper	miner.	Next	to	steel	he	loved	copper	best	of	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	was	tried	more	than	fifty	years	ago.	That’s	what	that	miner’s	grave	means out	 there.	 Copper	 mining	 was	 tried	 in	 many	 places.	 Had	 it	 not	 been	 for	 the supposed	 wealth	 of	 copper	 deposits	 here,	 the	 United	 States	 would	 never	 have owned	 Isle	 Royale.	 It	 would	 have	 gone	 to	 Canada.	 We	 bought	 it	 from	 the Indians.	 And,	 after	 years	 of	 labor,	 the	 copper	 miners	 discovered	 that	 copper mining	on	Isle	Royale	would	never	pay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 now,”	 he	 concluded,	 “it	 is	 one	 great	 big	 beautiful	 playground,	 the	 safe home	of	wild	life,	and	will	be,	I	hope,	for	years	to	come.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 believe,”	 he	 said,	 after	 a	 period	 of	 silence,	 “that	 some	 time	 to-morrow	 the wind	will	fall.	To-morrow	night	you	may	have	an	opportunity	to	tackle	the	great adventure—your	row	to	Passage	Island.	To-night	and	to-morrow	you	must	rest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	gladly	go	with	you	when	the	time	comes,”	he	added	thoughtfully,	“but	I	am large	 and	 heavy.	 I	 have	 a	 left	 arm	 that	 goes	 back	 on	 me	 when	 I	 row	 hard	 and long.	Got	a	bullet	there	once.	But	you’ll	make	it	all	right.	You’ll	make	it.	Never fear.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">THE	TRAIL	LEADS	NORTH</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">After	leaving	Drew	 Lane’s	room,	Johnny	 Thompson	had	walked	 the	streets	for hours.	He	needed	to	think.	He	could	think	best	while	walking,	so	he	walked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 had	 gone	 back	 on	 a	 man	 he	 thought	 of	 as	 a	 friend.	 Or	 had	 he?	 At	 least,	 it appeared	that	way	to	him	now.	Does	there	ever	come	a	time	when	it	is	one’s	duty to	turn	his	back	upon	a	friend?	A	hard	question.	He	could	not	answer	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three	times	he	passed	the	flower	shop	by	the	bridge.	The	shop	was	closed,	yet	a light	 cast	 upon	 the	 flowers	 in	 the	 window	 displayed	 Angelo’s	 skill	 as	 a	 florist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	an	artist	in	this	field.	No	one	could	equal	him.	Could	a	man	be	an	artist and	 yet	 be	 a	 rascal?	 Angelo	 loved	 music.	 Often	 he	 had	 talked	 to	 Johnny	 of symphony	 concerts,	 and	 of	 grand	 opera.	 Could	 one	 love	 the	 best	 in	 music	 and yet	be	a	villain	at	heart? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 walked	 across	 the	 bridge	 and	 back	 again.	 The	 place	 below	 the	 shop	 was completely	dark	to-night.	No	procession	of	men	was	passing	down	that	flight	of stairs.	 Perhaps	 Angelo	 had	 nothing	 to	 do	 with	 that	 which	 went	 on	 below	 his shop.	Perhaps	he	knew	nothing	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	again	his	mind	took	up	the	problem.	Angelo	had	always	been	friendly.	His smile	 was	 contagious.	 Was	 it	 true	 that	 a	 man	 could	 “smile	 and	 smile,	 and	 be	 a villain”? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	gave	the	problem	up	at	last,	returned	to	his	room,	and	was	soon	fast	asleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	awakened	next	moment	by	the	jangling	of	the	telephone.	Snatching	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">receiver,	he	said:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	morning!	Johnny	Thompson	speaking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a>“Johnny,”	came	back	an	excited	voice,	“it’s	Drew!	We’re	on	the	right	trail	at	last. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 old	 G.G.	 was	 right,	 has	 been	 right	 all	 the	 time.	 The	 trail	 leads	 north,	 five hundred	 miles,	 I’d	 say.	 Going	 in	 the	 red	 racer	 just	 after	 noon.	 Want	 to	 see	 this thing	through	with	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You—you	mean	go—”	Johnny	was	shaking	all	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure!	Go	north	with	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You—you	know	I	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right!	I’ll	be	over	here	at	twelve.	We’ll	have	a	bite	of	chow;	shoot	over	to	the aviation	field,	and	be	on	our	way.”	The	receiver	clicked.	He	was	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	sat	down	on	his	bed.	He	was	dizzy.	“The	trail	leads	north,”	he	muttered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	didn’t	say:	‘Johnny,	you’re	a	brick!’	or	any	of	that	sort	of	stuff,	or	‘You	put us	right.’	Nothing	like	that.	Just	‘The	trail	leads	north.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,”	he	thought	more	soberly,	“perhaps	I’m	not	a	brick.	Perhaps	I	didn’t	put them	right.	Perhaps	I’m	a	hundred	per	cent	dumb.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	sat	there	alone	he	realized	that	he	hoped	with	all	his	heart	that	he	had	been entirely	wrong.	“And	yet,”	he	murmured,	“and	yet—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 well!”	 he	 exclaimed,	 “‘A	 cup	 of	 coffee,	 a	 piece	 of	 pie	 and	 you.’	 To-morrow’s	another	day.	To-morrow	we	shall	probably	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	five	hundred	miles	due	north!”	His	mind	sobered.	“Just	Drew	Lane	and	I. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Drew’s	developed	into	a	swell	pilot.	He’ll	take	us	there	O.K.	But	after	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	been	through	some	tight	places	with	Drew	Lane,	as	you	will	know	if	you have	read	 <i class="calibre3">The	Arrow	of	Fire</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tight	places,”	he	muttered.	“Looks	like	this	might	be	tighter! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,	as	I	said	before,	‘A	cup	of	coffee,	a	piece	of	pie	and	you.’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">* 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 *</p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 Johnny	 Thompson	 and	 Drew	 Lane	 sped	 northward	 in	 the	 red	 racer	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>afternoon,	Johnny	found	plenty	of	time	for	thought.	Sober	thoughts	were	his.	At the	 airport	 Drew	 had	 said	 never	 a	 word	 regarding	 their	 coming	 adventure,	 nor the	facts	that	had	led	him	to	take	this	wild	dash	into	the	north. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	 a	 mill	 set	 to	 grind	 out	 products	 by	 electrical	 power,	 the	 boy’s	 mind	 went over	 the	 facts	 that	 lay	 before	 him.	 As	 he	 closed	 his	 eyes	 he	 could	 see	 a	 rusty jimmy	bar	lying	in	the	back	of	young	Angelo’s	boat.	He	could	feel	the	weight	of it	 as	 he	 carried	 it	 home	 and	 he	 experienced	 again	 his	 sharp	 surprise	 as	 Tom Howe	 discovered	 that	 this	 was	 the	 very	 bar	 that	 had	 pried	 open	 Red’s	 car window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	that	proved	nothing,”	he	told	himself.	“Any	one	could	have	hidden	the	bar in	that	speed	boat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 there	 is	 the	 invisible	 footprint.”	 His	 mind	 was	 off	 again.	 He	 saw	 the footprint	appearing	under	the	eerie	purple	light,	saw	it	fade,	then	appear	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	the	shoe	that	made	that	footprint	on	the	Red	Rover’s	sheet	was	found	close to	the	door	beneath	Angelo’s	flower	shop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	  <i class="calibre3">that</i>	 proves	 nothing.”	 He	 said	 the	 words	 aloud	 to	 the	 thundering	 motors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Any	one	can	drop	a	pair	of	shoes	by	your	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	yet—”	He	saw	again	the	figures	in	that	room	of	mystery	beneath	Angelo’s shop.	Who	were	those	men?	Why	were	they	there?	Why	were	so	many	of	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">wearing	black	looks?	And	why	had	they	attempted	to	throw	him	out? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“After	all,”	he	told	himself,	“it	all	depends	upon	the	last	bit	of	evidence	I	turned in,	the	shavings	made	by	Angelo’s	pocket	knife.	If	Tom	Howe	can	show	that	the shavings	found	near	the	Red	Rover’s	car	were	made	by	that	same	knife,	then	I shall	be	convinced.	And	once	one	is	convinced	that	a	supposed	friend	is	a	law-breaker	 there	 is	 but	 one	 thing	 he	 can	 do:	 see	 that	 he	 is	 brought	 to	 justice.	 No enemy	of	my	country	can	continue	to	claim	me	as	a	friend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	what	had	Tom	and	Drew	found	out?	This	remained	to	be	seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly	 his	 attention	 was	 caught	 by	 Drew	 Lane.	 Drew	 was	 leaning	 far	 over, looking	at	something.	There	was	a	worried	look	on	his	face.	But	at	last	he	settled back	in	his	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a>Again	Johnny	saw	in	his	mind’s	eye	the	picture	of	that	glassy-eyed	one	with	the scar.	Then	a	thought	struck	him	all	of	a	heap.	“Suppose	we	are	going	after	that man	 and	 his	 pals.	 Suppose	 they	 are	 all	 there,	 the	 glassy-eyed	 one,	 the	 big	 man like	a	baboon	and	his	son,	the	three	all	alike,	and	the	others!”	A	thrill	coursed	up and	down	his	spine.	A	not	entirely	comfortable	feeling	took	possession	of	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	but	two,	he	and	Drew.	There	was	a	small	black	bag	at	Drew’s	feet.	It was	full	of	blue-black	weapons	and	ammunition.	He	knew	that.	“But	two—just</p>
<p class="calibre1">two	of	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	dismissed	the	thought.	Drew	was	game,	game	to	the	last	drop.	But	he	was	no fool. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	 again	 Johnny	 closed	 his	 eyes.	 This	 time	 it	 was	 a	 different	 sort	 of	 person who	walked	across	the	walls	of	his	memory;	a	tall	man	with	smiling	eyes;	very tall	and	very	thin;	Jimmie	Drury,	the	reporter	from	the	News. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 had	 gone	 to	 Jimmie	 to	 obtain	 permission	 to	 go	 through	 the	 exchange	 files, and	then	a	curious	thing	had	happened.	It	puzzled	him	still.	“How’d	he	know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	grumbled.	“How	 <i class="calibre3">could</i>	he?	And	yet,	he	seemed	terribly	sure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jimmie	had	been	very	cordial.	“A	fellow	that’s	Drew	Lane’s	friend	is	welcome here	any	time.”	He	had	smiled	a	broad	smile.	“What	are	you	looking	up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	has	to	do	with	the	kidnaping	of	the	Red	Rover,”	Johnny	explained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Red	Rover!”	Jimmie	whistled.	“What	do	you	know	about	that	case?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Several	things.”	Johnny	had	been	on	his	guard.	“Got	a	lot	of	disconnected	facts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why	don’t	you	get	in	touch	with	Drew	Lane	and	find	out	about	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 am	 in	 touch	 with	 Drew.”	 A	 curious	 look	 came	 over	 Jimmie’s	 face.	 “Closer than	even	he	may—”	He	had	checked	himself	as	if	he	had	said	too	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	 looked	 at	 him	 and	 then	 a	 curious	 suspicion	 had	 popped	 into	 his	 mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jimmie	was	long	and	slim,	little	more	than	a	skeleton	in	blue	serge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A—a	skeleton.	A—”	He	had	nearly	thought	another	word,	but	not	quite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	he	had	said	to	Jimmie	was:	“Drew	doubts	the	Galloping	Ghost;	thinks	he’s trying	to	get	him	off	on	the	wrong	trail.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>Then	again	a	strange	look	had	flashed	across	the	reporter’s	face	as	he	exclaimed in	 a	 tone	 suggesting	 anger:	 “You	 tell	 Drew	 he’d	 better	 stick	 by	 the	 Galloping Ghost.	He’s	giving	him	straight	dope!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	could	he	know	that?”	Johnny	asked	himself	now	as	he	looked	down	once</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	 at	 the	 masses	 of	 black,	 white	 and	 dull	 green	 that	 were	 fields,	 lakes	 and forests	far	below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 little	 enough	 time	 to	 study	 this	 problem,	 for	 suddenly	 Drew	 headed the	red	racer	downward	at	a	rakish	slant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Down,	down,	down	they	went.	Once	the	motor	was	off	for	a	second. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	the	place?”	Johnny	demanded	breathlessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Far	from	it.	Something	wrong.”	Drew	spoke	rapidly.	“Got	to	go	down	and	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">what.	Land	on	the	little	lake	yonder.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	more	the	motor	roared.	As	the	plane	circled	downward	Johnny’s	hopes	fell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Something	 wrong!	 We’ll	 be	 here	 perhaps	 for	 hours.	 And	 get	 there	 too	 late. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	rotten	luck!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a><b class="calibre4">CHAPTER	XXVI</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">BATTLE	OVER	THE	WAVES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	hours	of	rest	for	the	Red	Rover	and	his	staunch	little	companion,	a lulling	of	the	wild	storm	that	for	many	hours	had	lashed	the	rocky	shores	of	Isle Royale.	Then	came	darkness	and	with	it	a	swift	resolve	to	risk	all	on	a	night	of pure	adventure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 hearty	 handshake	 with	 the	 guide	 who	 had	 stood	 by	 them	 so	 staunchly,	 and they	were	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowly	the	tiny	craft	crept	out	upon	the	black	waters	of	night.	They	had	dressed for	 the	 occasion,	 this	 girl	 and	 boy.	 He	 wore	 a	 suit	 of	 khaki	 borrowed	 from	 the scout,	 she	 a	 boy’s	 shirt	 found	 in	 one	 of	 the	 cabins,	 and	 the	 patched	 knickers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dressed	so,	and	riding	in	their	dark	green	boat,	only	with	difficulty	would	they be	seen	upon	the	dark	waters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 were	 reasons	 for	 this	 precaution,	 the	 scout	 had	 assured	 them.	 Having guessed	 their	 plan,	 the	 kidnapers	 might	 even	 now	 be	 lurking	 in	 the	 shadow	 of some	cove,	ready	to	pounce	upon	them.	For	this	Red	was	not	unprepared.	One	of the	“shootin’	irons”	hung	at	his	belt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keeping	close	to	shore,	they	passed	great	jagged	piles	of	rock	that	loomed	large in	the	night.	They	crossed	“Nebraska	Bay,”	skirted	more	rocks,	then,	following the	 scout’s	 advice,	 cut	 boldly	 away	 toward	 the	 rocky	 shoals	 which,	 because	 of the	darkness,	could	not	be	seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen!”	 The	 boy	 rested	 on	 his	 oars.	 There	 came	 no	 sound	 save	 the	 sound	 of heavy	swells	breaking	lazily	over	distant	rocks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’ll	be	some	roll	out	there,”	he	murmured. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	over	the	waters	there	moved	a	breath	of	air	that,	beginning	with	a	whisper, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a>ended	with	a	sigh	as	it	passed	on	into	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	weird	it	seems	out	here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Spooky!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	break	the	spell,	they	took	up	the	oars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	now,	as	on	that	other	occasion,	they	dropped	into	the	steady	rhythmic	swing that	would	carry	them	far	and	tire	them	not	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 did	 not	 sing,	 nor	 whistle,	 nor	 even	 hum.	 That	 would	 not	 be	 safe.	 For	 all that,	 their	 spirits	 blended	 as	 one	 as	 they	 swept	 along	 to	 the	 dreamy	 swing	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Blue	Danube,”	“Indian	Love	Song”	and	“Where	the	River	Shannon	Flows.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 steel	 mill	 and	 on	 the	 gridiron	 the	 young	 football	 star	 had	 known	 team work,	but	never	such	as	this.	Forgotten	were	the	perils	that	lurked	in	the	night; forgotten	 the	 danger	 of	 darkness	 and	 possible	 storm.	 For	 the	 moment	 here	 was life,	life	as	he	had	never	before	known	it.	What	else	could	matter? </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	with	the	moon	just	showing	over	the	rocky	crest	of	Isle	Royale,	they	swept across	 the	 narrow	 channel,	 then	 took	 up	 a	 course	 that	 in	 time	 would	 lead	 them out	into	the	wide	open	sea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girl	too	had	caught	the	spell	of	the	night.	As	they	stole	into	the	shadow	of	a great	rock	towering	up	from	the	depths,	she	shuddered,	but	rowed	steadily	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	real	little	brick!”	Red	thought	to	himself.	“Nothing	soft.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	resolved	that,	should	they	make	it,	she	certainly	must	be	on	the	side	lines	in that	greatest	of	all	games	that	was	to	come. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 rocks	 they	 passed	 grew	 lower	 and	 lower.	 The	 shoal	 was	 breaking	 up	 here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon	they	would	leave	it	all	behind.	And	then,	with	only	that	winking,	blinking light	to	guide	them,	they	would	face	the	swells	and	go	gliding	over	them	to—. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red’s	thoughts	broke	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had	 he	 heard	 something,	 the	 low	 groan	 of	 an	 oarlock,	 the	 mumble	 of	 a	 voice? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>Who	could	say?	It	did	not	come	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Swinging	the	boat	about,	he	headed	it	straight	for	the	Passage	Island	light	that, gleaming	a	good	four	miles	away,	seemed	to	send	them	an	encouraging	wink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 a	 rush	 of	 glee	 a	 great	 swell	 seized	 them	 and	 lifted	 them	 lightly.	 But,	 like some	 good-natured	 giant,	 it	 let	 them	 down	 gently	 to	 go	 on	 their	 way	 with	 a whispering	swish	of	foam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	now,	forgetting	their	songs,	they	put	their	shoulders	to	the	task	before	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meeting	the	swells	at	an	angle	to	avoid	the	dash	of	chilling	waters,	they	rose	on the	crest	of	a	high	one	to	drop	into	the	trough,	then	swept	across	a	half	score	of low	crests,	to	be	again	lifted	on	high. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	time	it	was	the	girl	whose	instinct	told	her	to	rest	on	her	oars.	Once	again there	passed	over	the	waters	that	whisper	that	ended	in	a	sigh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	as	if	voices	of	the	Unseen	were	trying	to	tell	us	something,	perhaps	to	warn us.”	Her	voice	was	low.	“Do	you	believe	in	the	Unseen?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I—I	don’t	know.”	It	was	weird,	this	whisper	in	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	again	they	took	up	their	oars.	Not	long	had	they	to	wait	ere	they	saw	that which	 was	 creeping	 upon	 them	 in	 the	 night.	 The	 moon	 had	 long	 been	 under	 a cloud.	Now	it	sent	its	beams	across	every	sweeping	swell.	And	upon	one	of	these swells	rode	a	boat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	rowboat,”	Red	grumbled	low.	“A	boat	and	two	men.	Now	it	is	life	or	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	are	armed.	They	will	not	hesitate	to	shoot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Realizing	the	truth	of	his	words,	the	girl	thrilled	to	the	very	center	of	her	being. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	need	for	no	explaining.	The	scout	had	been	right;	these	men	had	been watching.	They	had,	perhaps,	watched	from	the	wrong	point.	This	had	given	the boy	 and	 girl	 a	 start.	 But	 now	 here	 they	 were,	 some	 hundreds	 of	 yards	 behind, two	men	against	a	boy	and	a	girl,	and	half	the	distance	yet	to	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now!”	 The	 boy’s	 hiss	 answered	 the	 hiss	 of	 a	 wave	 that	 rolled	 by.	 “Now	 we</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a>must	show	them!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 did	 show	 them.	 They	 rowed	 with	 unity	 of	 motion	 and	 with	 all	 the	 force God	had	given	them;	rowed	until	even	in	the	chill	of	night	their	faces	ran	with perspiration	and	their	arms	became	bars	of	aching	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 yet,	 it	 was	 not	 enough.	 Those	 others	 were	 rowing	 with	 the	 desperation	 of those	who	hear	the	clanging	of	a	prison	gate	behind	them.	Beyond	a	doubt	they knew	 prison	 life.	 Theirs	 was	 the	 frenzy	 of	 those	 whose	 souls	 are	 stirred	 to	 the depths	 by	 great	 fear.	 They	 knew	 fear.	 This	 was	 their	 only	 emotion.	 Love,	 pity, compassion,	these	they	did	not	know.	So	they	worked	with	the	frenzy	of	despair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	they	gained	now	a	boat’s	length,	now	another,	another	and	yet	another.	Each wave	crest	that	lifted	them	high	found	them	closer	to	their	prey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 would	 have	 won	 but	 for	 one	 man’s	 over-reaching	 hate	 and	 the	 hosts	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Invisible	Ones”	that	the	girl	believed	peopled	the	heavens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	a	sudden,	weary	with	rowing,	overcome	by	his	burning	hate,	the	man	nearest the	prow	threw	down	his	oars.	The	next	instant	a	shot	rang	out	and	a	bullet	sang across	the	waters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lie	down	in	the	boat!”	was	Red’s	command	to	Berley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girl	hesitated,	but	obeyed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 the	 crest	 of	 the	 wave	 the	 boy	 bent	 low.	 Once	 again	 a	 bullet	 sang	 close	 at hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	trough	he	rowed	desperately.	Swinging	his	boat	half	about,	he	avoided,	as long	as	he	could,	rising	on	the	next	crest.	When	at	last	he	did	rise,	he	dropped flat	beside	his	companion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	in	time.	A	bullet	crashing	into	the	boat	passed	over	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Two	can	play	at	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	 crept	 forward,	 placed	 his	 “shootin’	 iron”	 across	 the	 stern,	 waited	 his	 time, then	loosed	a	roar	like	the	burst	of	a	cannon. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>The	answer	came	singing	over—too	high. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	as	if	provoked	by	the	unfairness	of	the	battle,	the	“Unseen”	took	a	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sudden	darkness	settled	upon	the	water.	A	cloud	as	black	as	ink	came	sweeping in	from	the	north.	A	voice	from	the	air,	not	a	whisper,	but	a	roar,	told	them	that one	of	those	sudden	storms	that	sweep	across	Lake	Superior	in	November	was	at hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girl	was	up	and	in	her	place	on	the	instant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	now	may	God	have	mercy	on	our	souls!”	she	murmured,	as	Red	seized	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">oars	and	they	began	to	row. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Who	can	describe	the	fury	of	such	a	storm,	the	rushing	of	wind,	waves	mounting higher	 and	 higher,	 foam	 hissing	 to	 the	 right	 and	 left	 of	 you,	 darkness	 all	 about you,	 even	 the	 gleam	 of	 the	 light	 from	 Passage	 Island	 lost	 for	 long,	 desperate moments? </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	yet	you	battle	as	never	before.	Heading	your	boat	squarely	into	the	teeth	of the	storm,	you	rise	and	fall,	rise	and	fall	like	a	cork	in	the	center	of	the	Atlantic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	battle.	You	pray.	You	hope	until	hope	seems	vain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then,	 just	 as	 all	 seems	 over,	 the	 storm	 passes	 with	 one	 long,	 whispering sigh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	moon	came	out	and	the	rush	of	wind	passed,	the	boy	and	girl	looked	upon a	 world	 of	 steel-blue	 waves	 flecked	 with	 foam.	 And	 on	 those	 waves	 some distance	 away	 there	 rode	 a	 boat.	 It	 was	 a	 white	 boat	 with	 an	 orange-colored bottom.	 A	 great	 deal	 of	 orange	 was	 showing;	 very	 little	 white.	 The	 boat	 was upside	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	again,	as	they	looked,	Red	said	hoarsely:	“Listen!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	before,	there	came	the	long	whisper	that	ended	with	a	sigh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	even	as	they	rested	on	their	oars	there	came	to	their	listening	ears	a	louder sound,	the	drumming	of	an	airplane’s	motor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	are	coming!”	Red	took	up	his	oars.	“Passage	Island	is	just	over	there.	It can’t	be	far	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a><b class="calibre4">CHAPTER	XXVII</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">A	HAUNTED	BAY</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 you	 have	 guessed,	 the	 plane	 heard	 by	 the	 Red	 Rover	 and	 Berley	 Todd	 was Drew	Lane’s	red	racer.	And	Johnny	Thompson	was	riding	in	the	rear	cockpit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drew	 had	 planned	 his	 trip	 well.	 They	 should	 have	 reached	 the	 island	 before dark.	But	misfortune	had	befallen	them.	Forced	down	by	a	leaky	fuel	pipe,	they had	found	themselves	on	the	surface	of	a	small	lake	in	the	midst	of	a	great	forest where	 there	 was	 no	 one.	 After	 two	 hours	 of	 labor	 with	 a	 few	 tools	 and	 scant material,	they	had	managed	to	repair	the	leak.	This	delay	had	forced	them	to	fly in	 the	 night,	 and	 here	 they	 were	 approaching	 an	 island	 known	 to	 them	 only	 by reports	and	by	a	map	that	lay	spread	out	before	Drew	in	the	cockpit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	 his	 meager	 knowledge,	 he	 did	 wonderfully	 well.	 Having	 arrived	 at	 the east	end	of	the	island,	he	flew	directly	across	it.	Catching	the	gleams	of	light	that came	 from	 three	 narrow	 bands	 of	 water,	 he	 knew	 them	 to	 be	 Rock	 Harbor, Tobin’s	Harbor	and	Duncan’s	Bay.	Choosing	the	middle	one	of	these,	he	dropped low	to	go	scooting	along	less	than	two	hundred	feet	in	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 he	 flew,	 the	 gleam	 of	 a	 powerful	 searchlight,	 attached	 to	 the	 plane,	 played upon	the	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	a	sudden	that	light	shot	upward,	then	blinked	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Found	 what	 he	 was	 looking	 for,”	 Johnny	 Thompson	 told	 himself.	 “But	 what was	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	this	question	he	could	form	no	certain	answer;	perhaps	a	boat,	a	cabin	or	an airplane.	 In	 fact,	 Johnny	 was	 almost	 completely	 in	 the	 dark	 regarding	 the purpose	and	probable	outcome	of	this,	the	latest	of	Drew	Lane’s	adventures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	had	met	the	young	detective	he	had	said	never	a	word.	In	silence	they</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>had	 climbed	 into	 the	 plane	 and	 flown	 away.	 Who	 had	 kidnaped	 the	 Red	 Rover and	 Berley	 Todd?	 Johnny	 did	 not	 know.	 Did	 Drew	 Lane	 know?	 Were	 the kidnapers	 on	 this	 island?	 Was	 the	 Red	 Rover?	 Was	 Berley	 Todd?	 The	 boy	 did not	 know.	 All	 he	 knew	 was	 that	 he	 appeared	 to	 be	 right	 bang	 up	 against	 one more	exciting	adventure,	and	that	was	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tipping	 the	 plane	 at	 a	 rakish	 angle,	 Drew	 Lane	 sent	 it	 over	 a	 narrow	 ridge	 of land	to	drop	at	last	upon	a	narrow	stretch	of	black	water.	This	was	Rock	Harbor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 scout’s	 cabin	 was	 not	 half	 a	 mile	 away.	 Hearing	 the	 drum	 of	 a	 motor,	 he extinguished	his	light,	then	sprang	to	the	door	just	in	time	to	see	the	plane	land. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hm!”	he	breathed.	“More	kidnapers,	officers	of	the	law,	or	just	ordinary	folks.	I expected	 to	 have	 a	 dull	 time	 at	 this	 place,	 all	 by	 myself,	 but	 blamed	 if	 it	 ain’t been	exciting	so	far.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 that	 he	 buckled	 his	 one	 remaining	 “shootin’	 iron”	 about	 his	 waist	 and disappeared	into	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	that	same	hour	a	second	plane,	all	silver	and	white,	circled	over	a	stretch	of water	black	as	night,	then,	graceful	as	a	sea	gull,	sank	to	rest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	body	of	water	was	Duncan’s	Bay.	Two	miles	long,	one	quarter	as	wide,	with trees	 growing	 to	 the	 very	 edge	 of	 its	 lapping	 waters	 and	 never	 so	 much	 as	 an abandoned	shack	standing	beside	it,	this	bay	at	all	seasons	of	the	year	is	a	dark and	lonesome	spot	as	night	falls	across	the	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Night	 was	 here.	 So	 too	 were	 the	 chill	 winds	 of	 November.	 But	 the	 single occupant	of	the	plane	appeared	to	give	little	heed	to	all	this.	Unfolding	a	curious sort	of	collapsible	rubber	boat,	he	filled	it	with	air,	took	a	short	paddle	from	his fusilage,	stepped	into	the	rubber	affair	and	paddled	ashore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	spot	upon	which	he	landed	had	perhaps	at	one	time	been	a	barren	stretch	of sand.	 Overgrown	 now	 with	 tangled	 grass	 and	 low	 bushes,	 it	 forms	 a	 perfect camping	ground.	Such	it	has	been	for	countless	generations.	From	this	spot	ten thousand	 camp	 fires	 have	 sent	 their	 golden	 gleams	 across	 the	 black	 waters	 of Duncan’s	Bay.	Each	in	turn	has	faded	into	the	darkness	of	night.	Had	this	strange visitor,	 a	 slender	 person	 in	 a	 long	 black	 coat,	 cared	 for	 such	 things,	 he	 might have	dug	beneath	his	very	feet	and	found	there	charcoal	and	half	burned	bones from	 fires	 that	 had	 gleamed	 a	 hundred,	 perhaps	 two	 hundred	 years	 ago.	 For, since	 Isle	 Royale	 lifted	 its	 rocky	 head	 from	 out	 the	 deep	 and	 took	 on	 a	 cap	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a>green,	this	spot	has	been	the	camping	place	of	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	stranger	did	not	dig.	He	stood	there	long	as	if	in	silent	contemplation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	might	have	fished,	for	in	these	very	waters	such	great	northern	pikes	(wolves of	 all	 fresh	 water	 seas)	 as	 are	 not	 found	 elsewhere	 play	 among	 the	 wavering weeds.	Had	he	cared	to	wait	for	dawn,	then	had	he	put	out	across	the	narrow	bay to	 set	 a	 silver	 spoon	 gleaming	 through	 the	 black	 waters,	 he	 might	 have experienced	such	a	thrill	as	is	seldom	accorded	a	fisherman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	did	not	wait	for	dawn.	Instead,	by	the	gleam	of	a	small	flashlight	he	studied	a slip	of	paper	for	a	moment;	then	turning	abruptly	about,	lost	himself	in	the	dense brush	that	lines	the	slope	of	a	high	ridge	just	back	of	this	narrow	clearing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Duncan’s	Bay	is	separated	from	Tobin’s	Harbor—which,	as	you	will	recall,	was the	 landing	 place	 of	 first	 the	 kidnapers’	 plane	 and	 after	 that	 Drew	 Lane’s	 red racer—by	a	tall	and	narrow	ridge	of	rocks	heavily	overgrown	with	brush. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	half	hour	after	this	tall	person	from	the	silver	plane	vanished	from	the	camping grounds	of	Duncan’s	Bay,	a	strange	apparition	might	have	been	seen	at	the	very crest	of	the	ridge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	this	spot,	known	as	Lookout	Louise,	one	may	stand	at	a	point	some	hundreds of	feet	above	the	water	level	and	look	down	upon	the	dark	and	somber	bay	that lies	 below.	 On	 this	 particular	 night,	 viewed	 from	 this	 height,	 the	 silver	 plane seemed	a	giant	sea	gull	with	wings	outspread. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 the	 apparition—he	 wore	 a	 long	 flowing	 robe	 of	 filmy	 white.	 As	 the	 moon came	 out	 to	 gleam	 upon	 him,	 his	 head	 appeared	 as	 white	 as	 his	 robe.	 And	 his body	 was	 bones,	 just	 gleaming	 white	 bones,	 or	 so	 it	 would	 have	 seemed	 had some	one	been	there	to	look.	There	was	no	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 one	 full	 moment	 he	 stood	 gazing	 down	 at	 the	 black	 waters	 and	 the	 silver plane.	Then,	turning	slowly	about,	he	gave	utterance	to	a	low,	hollow	chuckle	as weird	 as	 the	 song	 of	 the	 wind	 in	 the	 pines	 of	 a	 churchyard	 at	 midnight.	 Then, like	the	phantom	he	seemed,	he	dropped	away	into	the	shadows	that	lay	above</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tobin’s	 Harbor	 where	 at	 that	 very	 moment	 the	 fate	 of	 Drew	 Lane,	 Johnny Thompson	and	the	kidnapers	swung	uncertainly	in	the	balance.	And	even	as	this strange	apparition	vanished,	he	appeared	to	gallop. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	XXVIII</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">THE	LIGHT	THAT	FAILED</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Red!	Red!	The	light	is	gone!”	Berley	Todd’s	voice	rang	with	tragedy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 had	 endured	 much	 that	 night,	 had	 this	 little	 daughter	 of	 the	 rich.	 She	 had rowed	 until	 she	 felt	 herself	 near	 to	 exhaustion	 when	 of	 a	 sudden	 she	 had discovered	 that	 they	 were	 pursued.	 Getting	 her	 second	 wind,	 she	 had	 rowed	 as she	had	never	dreamed	any	one	could	row.	She	had	dodged	bullets	and	battled	a storm.	Now	the	light	from	Passage	Island	that	had	guided	them	all	the	way	had failed.	It	was	too	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Red!	The	light	is	gone!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somewhere	in	the	dark,	waves	were	dashing	against	rocks.	The	roar	of	it	filled her	ears.	Still	their	boat,	tossed	about,	moved	forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	must	row.”	Three	words	escaped	Red’s	tight	set	lips;	no	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 roar	 of	 waters	 sounded	 louder.	 The	 boy	 changed	 their	 course.	 They	 glided from	danger.	Now	and	then	the	girl	caught	the	gleam	of	a	white-cap	when	with the	hiss	of	a	sea	serpent	it	broke	close	beside	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	of	a	sudden	the	boy	put	all	the	strength	of	his	splendid	arms	into	a	dozen titanic	strokes.	They	rose	to	the	crest	of	a	wave;	another,	yet	another	and	then	as if	by	magic	they	glided	out	upon	a	sea	of	glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 girl	 caught	 her	 breath.	 What	 was	 it?	 Had	 she	 fallen	 asleep?	 Was	 she dreaming? </p>
<p class="calibre1">No,	no.	As	if	by	pre-arrangement,	the	moon	came	out	to	shine	upon	a	scene	of matchless	 beauty.	 A	 harbor,	 walled	 in	 on	 every	 side	 by	 steep,	 rocky	 cliffs,	 lay about	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a>“This,”	 said	 Red	 Rodgers,	 with	 a	 touch	 of	 the	 dramatic	 in	 his	 voice,	 “is	 the harbor	on	Passage	Island.	We	are	safe!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sinking	down	to	a	place	in	the	prow,	the	girl	allowed	her	head	to	drop	into	her hands	while	she	strove	in	vain	to	drive	from	her	senses	the	ceaseless	roar	of	the beating	surf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 a	 time	 she	 lifted	 her	 head	 to	 admit	 into	 her	 consciousness	 certain	 vital facts.	Her	feet	were	ankle	deep	in	water,	and	had	been	for	an	hour;	yet	she	had not	 known	 it.	 Her	 hands	 were	 blistered.	 Her	 arms	 ached.	 Red	 had	 found	 a flashlight	and	had	switched	it	on.	They	were	nearing	a	shore.	On	the	shore	was	a narrow	 dock	 and	 a	 boathouse.	 All	 this	 came	 to	 her	 as	 if	 she	 were	 a	 very	 small child	reading	it	from	a	book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	harbor,”	Red	spoke	at	last,	“is	about	a	mile	from	the	lighthouse.	There	is no	 safe	 landing	 there	 for	 such	 a	 night.	 The	 light	 is	 not	 out.	 We	 were	 passing along	close	to	a	rocky	wall	that	hid	the	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	is	a	trail	from	this	place	to	the	lighthouse.	And	at	the	lighthouse	there	is	a fire	and	blankets,	food	and	good	cheer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Food	and	good	cheer,”	the	girl	repeated	after	him	as	in	a	dream.	“Then	we	will go	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	did	go	there,	though	the	girl	will	not	recall	the	long	stretch	of	pasture-like land	 over	 which	 they	 passed,	 nor	 the	 ridge	 they	 scaled	 to	 descend	 on	 the	 other side	and	to	catch	again	the	blinking	rays	of	that	cheering	light.	She	will	not	recall all	this	because	she	walked	as	one	in	a	dream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	lighthouse,	besides	two	men,	there	was	a	woman,	the	head	keeper’s	sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	 her	 care	 Berley	 Todd	 was	 entrusted.	 When	 she	 had	 wrapped	 her	 in	 hot blankets	and	poured	steaming	broth	down	her	throat,	she	bundled	her	off	to	bed where	 for	 long	 hours	 Berley	 dreamed	 of	 kidnapers,	 wild	 waves	 and	 cracking guns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Red	Rover	did	not	sleep.	Never	more	awake	in	his	life,	he	found	himself	in a	 position	 to	 act;	 and	 the	 Red	 Rover	 was	 born	 for	 action	 alone.	 For	 days	 his immediate	 future,	 the	 possibility	 of	 getting	 back	 to	 Old	 Midway	 in	 the	 great game,	his	very	life	itself,	had	hung	in	the	balance.	Now	the	balance	had	swung down.	Fate	had	given	him	a	break. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a>As	he	stood	outside	the	lighthouse,	his	mind	still	in	a	whirl,	a	short	chubby	man with	a	beaming	sort	of	smile	approached	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	Pierre	Gagnon.	And	you,”	he	beamed	afresh,	“are	the	great	Red	Rover.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	what	they	call	me,”	Red	said	quietly.	“But	that	doesn’t	matter.	Only	one thing	truly	matters.	How	am	I	to	get	back	to	the	city	in	time	for	that	game? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 see—”	 He	 was	 growing	 eager	 now;	 all	 the	 dull	 feeling	 of	 weariness	 had left	him.	He	yearned	for	battle.	“You	see,	a	lot	depends	on	that	game.	Not—not for	 me,	 but	 for	 others.	 There’s	 the	 school,	 great	 Old	 Midway!	 It	 gave	 me	 a chance.	Took	me	out	of	the	steel	mill	and	taught	me	the	things	I	needed	most	to know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	there’s	the	Grand	Old	Man,	our	coach.	The	cleanest	sportsman	the	world has	ever	known.	And	this	is	his	last	year,	his	last	game.	That	game	must	be	won! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	the	public,	too.	They’re	hoping	against	hope.	They	suppose	that	I’ll	be there.	They	bought	tickets	to	help	out	a	great	cause.	They	should	get	a	show	for their	money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	 you	 see,”	 he	 smiled	 grimly,	 “it’s	 up	 to	 us,	 just	 you	 and	 me.	 To-morrow	 at two	p.	m.	the	team	lines	up.	Seventy	thousand	people	will	be	crying	for	victory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	should	see	it,	Pierre,	you	really	should!	It’s	inspiring!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll	 go	 in	 an	 airplane,”	 said	 Pierre.	 “You	 must.	 There	 can	 be	 no	 other	 way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 have	 here	 a	 radio	 telephone.	 We	 can	 speak	 with	 Detroit,	 Chicago,	 any	 big city	 of	 the	 midwest.	 To-day	 there	 are	 airplanes	 everywhere.	 It	 will	 be	 easy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Come!	We	will	send	out	the	call.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	call.	Wait!”	Once	again	the	boy’s	mind	was	in	a	whirl.	“The	call.”	It	would be	 heard	 everywhere.	 Men	 would	 rush	 to	 newspaper	 offices	 to	 sell	 the	 story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">The	 Red	 Rover	 found! </i>”	 would	 be	 flashed	 across	 the	 country.	 The	 radio,	 the press,	 and	 after	 that	 every	 man,	 woman	 and	 child	 would	 take	 up	 the	 cry:	 “<i class="calibre3">The</i> <i class="calibre3">Red	Rover	has	been	found! </i>”	He	thrilled	at	the	thought,	thrilled	to	the	very	center of	his	being.	But	did	he	want	this?	A	voice	deep	within	his	very	soul	whispered:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait!”	 His	 hand	 was	 on	 the	 arm	 of	 the	 genial	 lighthouse	 keeper.	 “Wait	 for	 a time,	at	least.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a>He	 recalled	 the	 sound	 of	 drumming	 motors	 that	 had	 struck	 his	 ears	 out	 there while	 he	 and	 the	 girl	 still	 tossed	 upon	 the	 waters.	 “There	 may	 be	 some	 other way,”	he	told	himself.	“No	brass	bands	for	me.	If	only	I	can	slip	back	to	the	city unheralded;	 if	 I	 could	 take	 my	 place	 behind	 the	 line	 when	 the	 great	 moment comes;	 if	 only	 I	 could	 do	 that	 without	 even	 the	 Grand	 Old	 Man	 knowing!	 Oh, boy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	again	he	murmured,	“Wait.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a><b class="calibre4">CHAPTER	XXIX</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">SILENT	NIGHT</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It	would	seem	that	Red	Rodgers’	reasons	for	wishing	to	rejoin	his	team	were	all that	 one	 might	 ask;	 yet	 at	 the	 very	 moment	 he	 stood	 there	 talking	 with	 the chubby	lighthouse	keeper,	Drew	Lane	was	telling	Johnny	Thompson	of	reasons</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 to	 him	 seemed	 tremendously	 important.	 These	 reasons	 had	 to	 do	 with	 the cause	of	the	kidnaping.	Who	would	not	find	this	a	subject	of	absorbing	interest? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drew	Lane	possessed	an	all	but	superhuman	power	of	finding	his	way	about	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	dark.	Though	he	had	never	before	seen	Isle	Royale,	he	not	only	was	able	to land	 safely	 in	 the	 channel	 known	 as	 Rock	 Harbor,	 but	 once	 ashore,	 he experienced	 little	 difficulty	 in	 making	 his	 way	 across	 the	 ridge	 to	 the	 other channel	that	lay	on	the	opposite	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This,”	he	said	to	Johnny	as	they	at	last	came	out	upon	a	short	boat	landing,	“is Tobin’s	 Harbor.	 At	 the	 back	 of	 this	 harbor	 the	 powerful	 amphibian	 that	 carried the	Red	Rover	to	Isle	Royale	lies	at	anchor.	Thus	far	we	are	in	luck.	If	the	Red Rover	 is	 still	 in	 their	 midst	 we	 shall	 be	 in	 greater	 luck.	 And	 if	 we	 succeed	 in rescuing	 him	 without	 having	 our	 much	 treasured	 heads	 blown	 off,	 ours	 will	 be the	greatest	luck	in	all	the	world.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 whose	 plane	 is	 that	 amphibian?”	 Johnny	 could	 no	 longer	 suppress	 a question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 have	 a	 right	 to	 know.”	 Drew	 Lane’s	 tone	 was	 serious.	 “It’s	 quite	 a	 story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	have	some	distance	to	go.	Here’s	a	boat	beside	the	landing.	Probably	chained up,	but	we’ll	break	her	loose.	Suppose	we	get	her	off?	Then	you	can	row	while	I talk.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“O.K.	Let’s	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a>The	padlock	that	held	the	boat	was	a	cheap	one.	Two	knocks	with	a	rock	opened it	as	though	it	were	a	clam	shell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ed,	the	scout,	crouching	with	his	dog	at	the	top	of	the	ridge,	heard	those	blows, but	wisdom	counseled	no	interference. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only	when	the	boat	was	gone	did	he	descend	the	hill.	After	skirting	the	shore	for a	short	distance,	he	proceeded	to	drag	a	light	canoe	from	the	center	of	a	clump	of bushes	where	it	stood	on	end,	safely	concealed.	In	this,	by	cutting	off	at	an	angle, he	was	able	to	keep	Drew	Lane	and	Johnny	Thompson	within	striking	distance</p>
<p class="calibre1">without	 himself	 being	 observed.	 Did	 he	 mean	 to	 strike?	 Perhaps	 he	 could	 not have	answered	this	question	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	a	curious	business.”	Drew	spoke	in	low	tones,	as	Johnny	with	long,	strong strokes	 drove	 the	 light	 rowboat	 along.	 “If	 you	 hadn’t	 been	 in	 on	 it	 perhaps	 we would	have	gotten	nowhere.	You	had	all	the	luck.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I?”	Johnny	lost	a	stroke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Luck	 no	 end!”	 Drew	 rumbled.	 “Remember	 the	 jimmy	 bar?	 The	 invisible footprint?	 The	 shavings?	 Sure	 you	 do.	 They	 were	 red	 hot	 clues	 that	 led	 us straight	to	the	spot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then—then	 it	 was	 Angelo,	 the—the	 flower	 shop	 keeper?”	 Johnny	 lost	 two strokes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	Angelo.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	time	after	that	there	was	silence.	This	silence	was	broken	by	Johnny.	His voice	was	husky.	“I	only	feel	bad	for	the	boy,	young	Angelo.	He	is	a	fine	young chap.	 And	 he	 has	 had	 everything—big	 car,	 speed	 boat—going	 to	 college. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything.	And	now—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	his	father	is	going	to	be	broke.	We	are	here	to	arrange	all	that.	We	must not	 fail.	 To-night	 Angelo	 Piccalo	 is	 rich.	 He	 believes	 he	 is	 safe,	 that	 his	 riches are	safe.	To-morrow	night	at	this	hour,	if	our	plans	work	out,	he	will	be	broke, broke	and	in	prison. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Too	many	times—”	Drew’s	voice	was	tense	with	pent-up	emotion.	“Too	many</p>
<p class="calibre1">times	 we	 go	 out	 and	 get	 a	 rich	 crook	 and	 he	 is	 able	 to	 buy	 his	 freedom,	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a>corrupting	a	judge	or	a	jury	with	the	very	money	he	stole	from	honest	men.	This time	there	shall	be	no	chance	for	this;	not	a	chance.	We—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look!”	His	voice	suddenly	fell	to	a	hoarse	whisper.	“Look!	Over	yonder	is	the light	of	a	camp	fire.	Must	be	their	camp,	the	kidnapers’	camp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here!”	Drew	bent	over,	then	straightened	up	to	thrust	a	thing	of	cold	steel	into Johnny’s	hand.	“Put	this	in	your	pocket.	And	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	obeyed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	 use	 ’em	 unless	 you	 have	 to.”	 The	 young	 detective’s	 tone	 was	 low	 and tense.	 “But	 if	 you	 have	 to,	 shoot	 often	 and	 straight.	 It’s	 a	 tough	 bunch.	 Don’t know	how	many,	but	plenty,	I’m	afraid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	for	the	boy,	Angelo,”	his	tone	changed,	“don’t	worry	too	much	about	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’ll	 have	 to	 get	 along	 without	 his	 car	 and	 speed	 boat	 all	 right.	 But	 then	 there are	plenty	of	people	who’ll	tell	you	big	cars	and	speed	boats	do	a	boy	more	harm than	 good.	 Gives	 them	 false	 notions	 of	 life;	 that’s	 what	 they’d	 tell	 you.	 I	 don’t know	much	about	that.	An	old	police	flivver	with,	like	as	not,	a	share	of	bullets waiting	at	the	end	of	the	road—that’s	as	far	as	I	ever	got. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	one	thing	I	 <i class="calibre3">do</i>	know.”	He	sat	up	straight	and	stiff.	“Crooked	dollars	never did	 any	 one	 any	 real	 good.	 And	 every	 dollar	 Angelo	 Piccalo	 spent	 on	 that	 boy was	crooked.	Flowers!	That	flower	shop	was	only	a	blind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	seems	strange,”	Johnny	mused,	pulling	hard	at	the	oars.	“Angelo	is	an	artist at	 heart.	 He	 can	 make	 flowers	 talk.	 He	 loves	 music,	 and	 the	 best	 in	 pictures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why	should	such	a	man	be	a	crook?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	man’s	love	of	honesty	has—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,	Johnny!	Swing	a	little	more	to	the	left.	We’ll	keep	well	out.	Then	when we’ve	 passed	 their	 camp	 we’ll	 swing	 in.	 They’re	 in	 a	 sort	 of	 clearing.	 Trees beyond	 them.	 Plenty	 of	 chance	 to	 slip	 up.	 They’ll	 not	 see	 us	 out	 here	 on	 the water.	The	moon	is	low	yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again	for	a	time	there	was	silence,	such	silence	as	one	finds	only	on	a	calm	bay of	 Isle	 Royale	 at	 night.	 Now	 came	 from	 afar	 the	 sharp	 yip-yip-yip	 of	 a	 bush wolf.	And	now,	from	the	opposite	shore	of	the	bay	they	caught	the	faint	plash-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a>plash	 of	 a	 moose	 swimming	 along	 the	 shore.	 Or	 was	 it	 a	 boat?	 Johnny’s	 heart skipped	a	beat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can’t	see	us.	Works	both	ways.	We	can’t	see	them.	Might	slip	up	on	us.	Then</p>
<p class="calibre1">—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 artist	 business,”	 Drew	 broke	 in	 with	 a	 hoarse	 whisper.	 “Curious	 thing.	 A man	can	be	a	fine	musician	or	a	painter,	and	still	be	a	crook.	They’ve	got	some fine	artists	in	Sing	Sing.	Art	and	conscience	have	no	connection,	it	seems.	The only	 thing	 that	 saves	 a	 fellow	 from	 being	 a	 crook	 is	 a	 desire	 deep	 down	 in	 his heart	to	be	honest,	to	do	right	by	all	men.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drew	lapsed	into	silence.	There	were	many	things	Johnny	wished	to	know.	How</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	it	that	Drew	felt	so	sure	he	was	on	the	right	track?	What	fresh	evidence	had he	uncovered?	How	much	had	his	own	discoveries	helped	to	bring	things	about? </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	this,	he	knew,	was	no	time	for	questions.	They	were	nearing	a	camp.	Was	it the	 enemies’	 camp?	 Who	 could	 doubt	 it?	 The	 big	 amphibian	 could	 not	 be	 a quarter	of	a	mile	from	that	camp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	in	that	silence,	broken	only	by	the	cries	of	wild	things	in	the	night,	he	rowed on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	after	them,	in	utter	silence,	there	came	a	canoe. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a><b class="calibre4">CHAPTER	XXX</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">HOLLOW	CHUCKLES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 a	 moose	 trail	 that	 leads	 down	 the	 steep	 slope	 of	 the	 ridge	 lying	 between Duncan’s	 Bay	 and	 Tobin’s	 Harbor	 a	 flashlight	 gleamed.	 Once,	 twice,	 and	 yet again	Johnny	Thompson	saw	that	light	flashing	among	the	trees	high	up	and	far away,	and	he	wondered	a	long	wonder.	He	said	nothing	to	Drew	Lane.	The	time</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 come	 for	 silence	 and	 action.	 Bending	 low,	 he	 drove	 their	 boat	 forward	 at increased	speed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile	 the	 light	 on	 the	 slope	 blinked	 on	 and	 off,	 was	 lost	 among	 the shadows	 of	 tall	 spruce	 trees,	 came	 out	 into	 the	 open,	 vanished	 behind overhanging	 rocks,	 then	 was	 lost	 to	 view	 altogether	 as	 it	 reached	 lower	 levels where	 giant	 spruce	 trees,	 a	 primeval	 forest,	 cast	 deep	 shadows	 over	 a	 small world	as	dark	as	a	tomb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 light,”	 Johnny	 told	 himself,	 “is	 no	 witch	 light	 of	 the	 night.	 Some	 one	 is coming	 down	 the	 ridge.	 Wonder	 who?	 And	 why?	 Drew	 said	 this	 island	 was practically	uninhabited	in	winter.	Looks	as	if	the	ghost	of	every	Indian,	explorer or	trader	who	ever	visited	these	shores	has	returned	to-night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ghosts,”	 he	 whispered	 to	 himself,	 “surely	 are	 queer!”	 He	 was	 thinking	 of	 the Galloping	Ghost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	we’ll	swing	in.”	It	was	Drew	who	broke	this	curious	chain	of	thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fifteen	minutes	more	of	silent	rowing	and	their	boat	touched	without	a	sound	on a	mossy	shore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good!”	 Drew	 breathed.	 “Bushes	 here.	 We	 can	 hide	 the	 boat.	 May	 need	 it	 in case—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 did	 not	 finish,	 but	 Johnny	 caught	 the	 meaning—in	 case	 the	 men	 they	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a>after	 were	 too	 strong	 for	 them.	 He	 had	 visions	 of	 Drew	 stumbling	 through	 the brush	carrying	his	bullet-riddled	body.	It	was	not	a	pleasing	vision.	He	put	it	out of	his	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	indeed	there	was	need	of	this.	There	was	little	or	no	trail	on	this	side	of	the channel.	 Here	 a	 moose	 had	 crowded	 his	 way	 through	 the	 brush;	 and	 here, becoming	discouraged,	he	had	left	the	next	comer	to	make	the	best	of	things	and had	taken	to	the	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	need	for	extreme	caution.	The	snapping	of	a	twig,	the	sudden	rush	of a	moose	disturbed	in	the	night,	would	betray	their	presence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About	half	the	way,”	Drew	breathed	at	last. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	stretch	of	barren,	sloping	rocks	greeted	their	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Skirt	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	crept	across	in	the	shadows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Must	 be	 nearly	 there.	 Get	 ready.”	 Drew	 was	 calm.	 Though	 little	 more	 than	 a boy,	he	was	a	seasoned	trooper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There!	There’s	a	gleam	of	light!”	Johnny	gripped	his	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	around	this	next	clump	of	pines	we’ll	get	a	clear	view.	And	then—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	around	those	pines	before	Johnny	in	his	suspense	breathed	twice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now!	You	ready?”	Drew	squared	his	shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	then,	you	fellows!”	His	voice	sounded	out	strangely	in	the	night.	“We	got you	covered.	Reach	for	the	stars!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	sound	of	sudden	commotion	by	the	camp	fire.	Three	figures	leaped into	 view.	 But	 they	 were	 not	 “reaching	 for	 the	 stars.”	 Their	 hands	 hung awkwardly	at	their	sides. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	what—”	Drew	all	but	dropped	his	gun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	not	the	bunch	we’re	after,”	he	said	in	a	low	tone	aside	to	Johnny.	“Got	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a>keep	’em	comin’	though.	Got	guns.	May	shoot	us	without	knowing	what	it’s	all about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	you	are!”	he	commanded	sharply.	“One	move,	and	out	goes	your	light.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 men	 did	 not	 move.	 Instead,	 as	 Drew	 approached	 them	 slowly,	 they	 stood blinking	into	his	flashlight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drew	took	in	the	scene	at	a	glance.	The	camp	had	been	made	on	a	shelving	rock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	little	back	from	the	fire	lay	the	hind	quarters	of	a	moose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great	 luck!”	 he	 thought	 to	 himself.	 “Poachers.	 Not	 allowed	 to	 kill	 moose	 on this	island.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Honest,	mister,”	it	was	a	grown	boy	who	spoke	at	last,	“we	only	kill	what	we got	to	have	to	eat.	We	can’t	starve.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ya,	we	do,”	put	in	a	heavy-set	man	with	ham-like	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We-l-l—”	Drew	was	thinking	fast.	“I’m	an	officer	of	the	law.	I	could	take	you all	 right.	 But	 I’m	 after	 bigger	 game.	 There	 are	 kidnapers	 on	 this	 island.	 Know that?”	He	turned	to	the	boy	of	the	group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I—	There’s	some	queer	ones	back	there	at	Baley’s	cabin.	We	seen	’em.	Sort of	black.	But	not	niggers,	I	don’t	think.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	the	ones.	How’d	you	like	to	help	catch	them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We—”	The	boy	stared.	Then	of	a	sudden	he	started	talking	rapidly	in	a	strange language.	His	two	beefy	companions	listened	with	popping	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ll	do	it,	all	right,”	Drew	whispered	to	Johnny.	“Got	to!	Between	the	devil and	 the	 deep	 blue	 sea,	 they	 are.	 Go	 to	 jail	 for	 poaching	 or	 help	 catch	 crooks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	would	you	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	go,”	the	strange	boy	said	simply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ya.	We	do,”	one	of	the	men	agreed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good!	 Now	 we	 are	 five,”	 Drew	 exulted.	 “Not	 a	 bad	 lot,”	 he	 mumbled	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a>Johnny.	“Just	ignorant	and	hungry.	Good	shots,	too,	I’ll	bet	on	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	 took	 a	 long	 breath.	 All	 that	 suspense,	 and	 the	 kidnapers	 still	 some distance	 away!	 He	 felt	 very	 much	 like	 an	 empty	 sack.	 But	 he	 must	 carry	 on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shaking	himself,	he	set	his	teeth	hard.	“All	right,	I’m	ready.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	again	they	plunged	into	the	night.	Now	they	were	five	men	and	two	boats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	all	the	while	the	mysterious	flashlight	was	making	its	way	along	the	shore, coming	 from	 the	 opposite	 direction	 toward	 Baley’s	 cabin	 which	 might,	 Johnny believed,	be	the	scene	of	a	bloody	battle	within	the	hour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 time,	 after	 a	 careful	 study	 of	 the	 situation,	 Drew	 decided	 that	 the	 journey should	be	made	entirely	by	water.	The	island	was	narrow,	the	boy	moose	hunter explained.	A	dock	virtually	formed	a	door	step	to	the	cabin.	One	had	but	to	reach that	dock,	and	he	was	at	the	cabin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	fellows	lead	the	way,”	Drew	commanded.	“Not	too	fast.	Watch	your	oars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	 a	 creak	 from	 them.	 Keep	 your	 oarlocks	 damp.	 And	 don’t	 talk!	 Not	 a whisper!	If	these	men	get	the	drop	on	you,	whang!	You’re	gone!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ya.	We	do,”	the	older	of	the	men	agreed	hastily.	Johnny	noticed	that	his	knees were	shaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	shock	troops,”	was	his	mental	comment.	“No	good	for	a	real	scrap.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	half	hour	of	breathless	suspense,	and	they	were	gliding	along	the	island’s	short shore	line,	nearing	the	dock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now!”	Drew	had	driven	their	boat	alongside	the	others.	“You	fellows	fall	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’ll	take	the	lead.	Wherever	we	go,	you	follow	close!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	caught	this	whispered	command,	fell	back,	then	followed	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drew	 had	 driven	 their	 boat	 to	 the	 very	 side	 of	 the	 dock,	 and	 was	 in	 the	 act	 of creeping	toward	the	prow,	when	he	paused	to	hiss:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	need	for	this	command.	Johnny’s	keen	ears	had	caught	it,	the	most	unearthly</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>sound	heard	on	land	or	sea—a	hollow	chuckle	that	fairly	dried	the	marrow	in	his bones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wha-what	is	it?”	he	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	knows?”	Drew	was	creeping	forward	once	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Light	in	the	cabin,”	came	back	to	Johnny	faintly.	“They’re	there	all	right.	We’ll creep	up	on	’em.	Get	the	drop	if	we	can.	We—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again	came	that	hollow	chuckle.	“As	if	it	came	from	an	empty	cabin.”	Johnny</p>
<p class="calibre1">shuddered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	set.	Come	on.”	Hollow	chuckles	meant	little	to	Drew	Lane. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Forgetting	the	moose	hunters	at	their	backs,	they	crept	across	the	short	stretch	of planking	that	led	to	the	cabin	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	thought	he	heard	his	heart’s	wild	beating.	Some	creature,	small	and	very fast,	 shot	 across	 the	 way	 before	 them.	 It	 was	 with	 the	 utmost	 difficulty	 that	 he kept	his	lips	sealed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now!”	Drew’s	hand	was	on	the	knob.	“I’ll	throw	the	door	open.	You	cover	’em. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shoot	if	they	make	a	false	move.	Kidnapers	have	little	claim	on	life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	the	door	is—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	 did	 not	 finish.	 The	 door	 was	 open.	 He	 found	 himself	 standing	 beside Drew	 in	 the	 dark;	 the	 candle	 light	 of	 the	 room	 was	 gone.	 Two	 bulky	 figures stood	before	them.	On	the	table	something	bright	gleamed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Guns!”	he	told	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Astonishment	 all	 but	 overcame	 him	 as	 he	 realized	 that	 their	 presence	 was	 not even	suspected.	Then	men	were	standing	with	their	backs	to	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	took	but	one	glance	at	the	window	in	the	opposite	wall	to	discover	the	cause	of this	 unheard-of	 suspense.	 Outside	 the	 window	 was	 a	 grinning,	 gleaming	 skull. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a>And	even	as	Johnny	saw	it	there	came	again	that	unearthly	chuckle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quite	as	paralyzed	as	those	before	him,	Johnny	stood	open-mouthed,	staring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	Drew	Lane	who	broke	the	spell.	“All	right	there!”	His	tone	was	smooth and	cold	as	ice.	“You,	Tony	Piccalo,	and	you,	Spike	O’Connor!	Just	reach	for	the sky!	And	if	you	can’t	get	it,	just	keep	on	reaching!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 one	 hand	 he	 held	 his	 own	 automatic,	 with	 the	 other	 he	 was	 removing	 the gangsters’	weapons	to	his	own	pockets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	men	whirled	about.	For	a	second	silence	too	deep	for	words	hung	over	the place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 all	 right,”	 one	 of	 the	 men	 grumbled.	 “You	 got	 us.	 We	 don’t	 fight	 spooks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	the	Galloping	Ghost.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 don’t	 believe	 in	 ghosts.”	 Drew	 switched	 on	 his	 flashlight.	 “Now,	 then,	 you fellows	sit	right	down	there	in	the	corner,	and	I’ll	tell	you	what	we	want	you	for, and	why. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	won’t.”	His	voice	changed	as	his	eyes	roved	the	room.	“Where’s	the	Red Rover	 and	 that	 girl,	 Berley	 Todd?	 Come,	 now!	 Quick!	 Where	 are	 they?”	 The steel	in	his	gun	was	not	harder	than	the	ring	in	his	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Honest—”	The	man	known	as	Spike	O’Connor,	a	bad	one	according	to	his	own</p>
<p class="calibre1">previous	estimation,	was	shaking.	“Honest,	we	don’t	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	know?”	Drew’s	finger	trembled	at	the	trigger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fact!”	the	other	man	put	in	hastily.	“Got	away	from	us,	they	did,	more’n	three days	ago.	We	sent	out	a	man	to	look	for	them.	He	didn’t	come	back.	We	sent	out two	more.	They	didn’t	come	back.	I	tell	you,	this	island	gets	’em!	Ghosts	and	all that.”	The	way	this	bad	man	trembled	was	good	to	see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	I	might	be	able	to	help	you,”	came	from	the	doorway.	Johnny	whirled about	to	find	himself	staring	into	a	pair	of	friendly	eyes	that	gleamed	beneath	a ten-gallon	hat.	Ed,	the	scout,	had	caught	up	with	them	at	last. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ve	 been	 with	 me	 until	 to-night,	 the	 Red	 Rover	 and	 Berley	 Todd	 have.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a>The	scout	advanced	to	the	center	of	the	room.	“Now	unless	that	squall	we	had	an hour	 or	 two	 ago	 took	 ’em	 out	 to	 sea,	 they	 should	 be	 on	 Passage	 Island	 where there	are	civilized	human	beings.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	 that	 case,”	 said	 Drew,	 spinning	 about,	 “we’ve	 got	 to	 fly	 over	 to	 Passage Island.	And	that	on	the	double	quick!	Can’t	let	this	get	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	 is	 this	 Passage	 Island?”	 he	 demanded	 of	 the	 scout.	 “Can	 a	 fellow	 land there	in	a	sea	plane?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Four	miles	off	Blake’s	Point.	Land	on	the	lee	side	all	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	we’re	off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here,	Johnny,	slip	these	on	’em.”	He	dangled	two	pairs	of	handcuffs.	“It’ll	be	a little	crowded	with	four	of	us	in	the	red	racer,	but	we’ll	make	it.	We—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	broke	off	to	stare	at	the	doorway.	Standing	there	was	a	very	tall	and	very	thin young	man	in	a	tight-fitting	suit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jimmie	Drury!”	he	exclaimed.	“How’d	you	come	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Walked,	old	son.	Walked.	How’d	you	suppose?”	Jimmie	Drury,	reporter	for	the News,	grinned	from	ear	to	ear.	“Worth	it,	too!	Grand	story.	Good	old	scoop!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	 enough	 story,”	 Drew	 grumbled.	 “But	 you’ll	 not	 shoot	 it	 till	 I	 tell	 you when.	I’ll	tell	you	about	that	later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	 off	 for	 Passage	 Island,”	 he	 grinned.	 “You’ll	 walk	 there,	 too,	 I	 suppose; just	four	miles	of	Lake	Superior.	And	they	tell	me	Superior	never	gives	up	her dead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	 be	 there,	 never	 fear!”	 Jimmie	 laughed.	 “Sooner	 than	 you’d	 think!	 Before you	arrive,	perhaps.	Who	knows?” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">“PLAY	BY	PLAY” </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 one	 o’clock	 the	 next	 afternoon	 the	 cement	 seats	 of	 Soldiers’	 Field,	 where seventy	 thousand	 spectators	 were	 to	 witness	 a	 football	 classic	 of	 unparalleled interest,	began	filling	up.	The	place	had	been	sold	out	for	ten	days.	Even	before the	 Red	 Rover	 vanished	 every	 ticket	 was	 gone.	 There	 were	 several	 reasons	 for this.	 It	 was	 a	 charity	 game;	 the	 entire	 net	 proceeds	 of	 the	 game	 were	 to	 be expended	 on	 the	 city’s	 needy.	 It	 was	 the	 great	 game	 of	 the	 year.	 The	 rivalry between	Old	Midway	and	Northern	had	ever	been	keen,	never	keener	than	now, </p>
<p class="calibre1">for	this	game	was	to	decide	the	championship	of	the	conference.	The	Red	Rover was	 to	 play,	 and	 it	 had	 been	 rumored	 abroad	 that	 this	 would	 be	 his	 last	 game, that	he	would	not	return	to	his	squad	in	the	following	autumn.	It	was	to	be	the Old	Midway	coach’s	last	game.	He	had	definitely	retired.	And	those	who	loved the	Grand	Old	Man	of	football	were	legion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	 here	 they	 were	 gathering	 early.	 Some	 coming	 from	 afar	 had	 arrived	 early. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some,	 fearing	 that	 the	 place	 had	 been	 oversold,	 were	 hastening	 to	 secure	 their seats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	morning	there	had	been	a	whisper	abroad.	“The	Red	Rover	will	play	to-day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus	 the	 whisper	 ran.	 One	 heard	 it	 on	 the	 street	 corner,	 behind	 the	 counters	 in department	 stores,	 in	 the	 corner	 cigar	 store.	 When	 the	 over-curious	 rang	 up	 a newspaper	 office	 they	 were	 greeted	 by	 a	 curt	 denial.	 “We	 know	 nothing	 of	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wish	we	did!”	Bang!	went	the	receiver.	The	phones	of	Old	Midway’s	office	rang constantly.	“No!	No!	No!”	the	patient	clerks	repeated	over	and	over.	“He	has	not returned	to	Old	Midway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	over	that	great	city	expectancy	hung	like	a	thin	cloud.	And	the	early	arrivals on	the	field	whispered:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will	he	be	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a>* 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 *</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	office	beside	the	lighthouse	on	far	away	Passage	Island	sat	Drew	Lane	and Johnny	Thompson.	Whatever	else	happened,	they	would	not	see	the	game.	There</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 two	 others	 who	 would	 not	 see	 that	 game.	 Tony	 Piccalo	 and	 Spike O’Connor	sat	moodily	in	the	far	corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	some	time	before	the	game,”	Drew	commented	dryly,	casting	a	significant glance	 at	 a	 radio	 that	 stood	 against	 the	 wall.	 “Just	 about	 time	 for	 a	 little	 story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’ll	be	interested	in	this.”	He	turned	to	Johnny.	“You’ve	guessed	at	a	part	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	it	all	may	be	told. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 fellows—”	 He	 addressed	 himself	 to	 the	 others.	 “You	 fellows	 are	 not kidnapers	by	profession.	Give	the	devil	his	dues.	But	for	all	that,	the	fellow	who stoops	to	kidnaping	in	order	that	he	may	gain	an	end	just	once	is	lost,	or	should be.	It’s	the	lowest	crime	on	the	docket,	the	least	romantic,	the	most	cowardly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You,”	his	voice	rose,	“are	professional	gamblers,	and	that	rates	you	pretty	low, too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 turned	 to	 Johnny.	 “You	 see,	 what	 happened	 was	 this.	 These	 fellows,	 with Tony’s	 brother,	 Angelo,	 have	 been	 operating	 a	 gambling	 den	 beneath	 Angelo’s flower	 shop	 for	 a	 long	 time.	 Race	 track	 stuff,	 baseball	 pools	 and	 all	 that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somehow	we	didn’t	get	next	to	them	until	you	found	that	jimmy	bar	that	lifted the	 Red	 Rover’s	 window,	 and	 the	 shoe	 that	 made	 the	 invisible	 footprint	 was brought	in	by	the	Rat.	Then	we	began	to	suspect	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	 you	 brought	 in	 that	 batch	 of	 shavings	 from	 Angelo’s	 favorite	 pocket knife	 and	 we	 found	 they	 matched	 those	 made	 near	 the	 scene	 of	 the	 kidnaping; when	 you	 told	 us	 about	 being	 thrown	 from	 that	 room	 beneath	 the	 flower	 shop, we	knew	we	were	on	the	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 pair	 of	 culprits	 sat	 listening	 in	 stolid	 silence.	 Johnny	 heaved	 a	 sigh.	 So	 he had	been	useful	in	this	search.	He	was	glad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	found	out	in	no	time	at	all,”	Drew	went	on,	“that	these	birds	had	organized a	football	pool.	They	were	betting	on	a	grand	scale	on	to-day’s	game,	giving	all manner	of	odds.	And	why	not?	You	cowards!”	He	shot	a	look	at	the	corner	of	the room.	“You	knew	all	the	time	that	you	meant	to	kidnap	the	Red	Rover	and	hide him	on	Isle	Royale	until	the	game	was	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p163"></a>“The	game.”	His	voice	dropped.	“The	game	has	not	yet	started.	The	kick-off	is	at two	o’clock.	And	such	a	game	as	it	will	be! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	see,”	he	turned	again	to	Johnny,	“when	we	knew	what	you	had	discovered, the	 rest	 was	 easy.	 Tony,	 here,	 is	 a	 licensed	 pilot	 and	 owns	 that	 big	 amphibian. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Owns	 it!	 Strange	 what	 some	 men	 will	 do	 to	 get	 more	 money	 when	 they	 are already	 rich!	 But	 crooked	 money	 calls	 for	 more	 and	 more,	 always	 more	 and more.	That’s	why	a	crooked	dollar	is	such	a	terrible	thing	to	possess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Since	Tony	had	that	plane	and	he	had	been	at	Isle	Royale	last	summer,	as	young Angelo	 told	 you,	 as	 soon	 as	 we	 saw	 that	 clipping	 about	 the	 mysterious	 plane over	Isle	Royale,	we	knew	just	where	to	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	the	rest.”	He	smiled	at	Johnny.	“How	we	found	them	and	got	them, </p>
<p class="calibre1">how	we	flew	here	in	the	red	racer	just	in	time	to	prevent	the	broadcasting	of	our great	discovery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 you	 don’t	 know,	 and	 what	 these	 fellows	 don’t	 exactly	 know,”	 his	 eyes snapped,	“is	what	is	about	to	happen	down	there	in	the	city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’ll	be	a	football	game	played.	Right!	The	Red	Rover	will	play.	He’ll	win! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	here	comes	the	kidnapers’	reward.	Some	crooks	get	to	jail	rich.	They	beat the	rap	or	go	free	in	two	years,	still	rich.	None	of	that	here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	once	more	to	the	corner.	“You	fellows,	you	and	your	associates	have bet	your	last	dollar	on	the	team	that	was	to	defeat	Old	Midway	because	of	your crookedness.	We	know	where	all	that	money	is	stored.	That	team	will	not	win. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	pal,	Tom	Howe,	and	plenty	more	cops	are	ready	to	see	that	every	dollar	you wagered	is	paid.	And	then—​you—​will—​be—​broke!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	groan	came	from	the	corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 think	 that’s	 too	 tough!”	 Drew	 leaped	 to	 his	 feet.	 “It’s	 not!	 Nothing	 is	 too bad	for	a	kidnaper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 you,	 Tony!”	 He	 pointed	 a	 finger.	 “You	 kidnaped	 that	 Berley	 Todd,	 a defenseless	 girl,	 because	 you	 could,	 and	 because	 you	 thought	 you	 could	 pull down	twenty	extra	grand	for	yourself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p164"></a>“She’ll	be	cheering	on	the	side	lines.”	He	laughed	a	happy	laugh.	“That	little	girl will	 be	 cheering	 for	 the	 Red	 Rover,	 the	 best	 sport	 that	 ever	 lived.	 And	 you fellows	 are	 going	 to	 sit	 right	 in	 this	 room,	 getting	 the	 radio	 report	 and	 hearing yourselves	go	broke	play	by	play.  <i class="calibre3">Play	by	Play! </i>” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">“70,000	WITNESSES” </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 Johnny	 listened	 to	 Drew	 Lane’s	 rapid-fire	 report	 of	 events	 and	 their outcomes,	 he	 realized	 that	 he	 had	 played	 no	 small	 part	 in	 the	 breaking	 up	 of	 a notorious	band	of	gamblers	and	the	thwarting	of	their	plans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“More	luck	than	skill	on	my	part,”	he	whispered	to	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	 then	 a	 thought	 struck	 him	 with	 the	 force	 of	 a	 blow.	 What	 if	 the	 gamblers’</p>
<p class="calibre1">plans	 had	 not	 been	 thwarted	 after	 all?	 Had	 Drew	 Lane	 talked	 too	 soon?	 How could	they	know	that	the	Red	Rover	had	reached	the	city	safely?	Hour	by	hour, with	 monotonous	 regularity	 the	 radio	 reported:	 “Still	 missing.”	 Was	 he	 still missing?	Would	he	fail	to	appear	when	the	team	lined	up	for	the	kick-off? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	 know	 that	 soon	 enough.”	 He	 glanced	 at	 the	 clock	 on	 the	 wall.	 “Twenty minutes	more,	and	then—”	He	took	a	long	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	means	so	much!”	He	all	but	prayed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 again	 doubt	 assailed	 him.	 Suppose	 the	 Red	 Rover	  <i class="calibre3">had</i>	 reached	 the	 city; suppose	he	did	line	up	with	his	team?	He	had	been	away	from	practice	for	days; had	missed	all	the	elaborate	plans	made	for	this	game	of	games.	He	had	not	lived as	players	live	who	are	training	for	a	major	event.	“And	every	one	feels	that	if	he were	only	there	the	game	would	be	won	before	the	kick-off!”	He	fairly	groaned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	again	he	glanced	at	the	clock.	“Fifteen	minutes	to	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	nervous	fingers	he	snapped	on	the	radio. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here	we	are,”	the	announcer	was	saying.	“The	seats	are	rapidly	filling	up.	The aisles	are	packed.	What	a	picture!	Gay	sport	costumes;	bright	banners;	pennants waving;	bands	playing.	Listen!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a>Out	from	the	radio	came	the	stirring	notes	of	a	march. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There!	 There!”	 the	 announcer	 shouted	 into	 the	 microphone.	 “They’re	 coming out	 now.	 The	 players	 are	 coming	 on	 the	 field.	 There’s	 Old	 Midway.	 Number twenty-one,	Masters,	the	giant	fullback;	eighteen,	Dwyer,	right	half.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	 caught	 his	 breath.	 Was	 it	 known	 by	 now?	 Would	 Red	 come	 upon	 the field?	His	number	was	twenty.	Would	he	hear	it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Twenty-eight,	 Sullivan,	 the	 slim	 quarterback,”	 the	 announcer	 recited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Seventeen,	Clarke,	the	center;	and	now	Johnson,	the	left	half,	who	as	you	know, replaces	the	famous	All-American	star,	Red	Rodgers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	 heard	 no	 more.	 His	 hopes	 sank.	 From	 the	 corner	 came	 an	 exultant whisper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 the	 whisper	 came	 too	 soon.	 Jimmie	 Drury,	 the	 slender	 reporter	 from	 the News,	 had	 carried	 the	 Red	 Rover	 and	 his	 diminutive	 companion,	 Berley	 Todd, speedily	and	safely	from	the	enchanted	isle	back	to	the	city.	After	landing	in	an open	field	close	to	the	city,	they	tramped	into	the	suburbs	and	registered	under assumed	names	at	a	small	hotel.	Jimmie	made	no	effort	to	get	in	touch	with	his paper.	 In	 his	 pocket	 he	 carried	 a	 story	 that	 would	 have	 made	 the	 first	 page	 in every	 newspaper	 of	 the	 land.	 “The	 Red	 Rover	 has	 been	 found.	 He	 is	 safe.	 He will	play.”	He	could	see	it	across	the	page	in	glaring	letters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	story	was	not	told.	Jimmie	was	loyal,	loyal	to	the	core.	Drew	Lane	had	told him	what	to	do.	He	would	do	it,	cost	what	it	might. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“These	men,”	Drew	had	said	sternly,	“must	not	know.	They	must	pay	in	full	for their	greed	and	for	their	cowardly	deeds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	they	shall	pay!”	Jimmie	had	agreed.	So	it	came	about	that	just	as	the	ball was	being	placed	for	the	kick,	a	youth	whose	shining	new	suit	bore	the	number twenty	 came	 trotting	 out	 to	 say	 a	 word	 to	 the	 referee,	 then	 to	 tap	 number fourteen	on	the	back	and	to	mumble	apologetically:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,	Johnson.	Better	luck	next	time!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	the	Red	Rover. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a>From	the	vast	throng	there	came	a	sound	like	the	wind	flowing	through	the	tops of	a	thousand	trees.	They	had	seen	that	number.	Were	they	to	believe	their	eyes? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 sigh,	 the	 whisper,	 grew	 to	 a	 shout.	 Then	 the	 sons	 and	 daughters	 of	 Old Midway	 leaped	 to	 their	 feet	 and	 such	 a	 cheer	 rent	 the	 air	 as	 was	 echoed	 back again	and	again	by	the	distant	skyscrapers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing	this,	Red	Rodgers	felt	a	chill	rise	up	his	spine.	They	had	seen	him.	They expected	so	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	if	I	lose,”	he	murmured	low,	“if	I	lose!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	set	his	teeth	hard.	He	could	not,	he	must	not	lose! </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	far	away	Passage	Island	Johnny	Thompson	and	Drew	Lane	heard	the	shout</p>
<p class="calibre1">that,	 growing	 in	 volume,	 came	 welling	 forth	 from	 the	 radio	 like	 the	 increasing roar	of	a	raging	sea.	They	heard	it	and	understood.	And	from	the	corner	where the	kidnapers	sat	there	came	again	a	low	groan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	this	moment	Johnny	was	tempted	to	feel	sorry	for	these	men	who	had	lost	so much.	“And	yet,”	he	told	himself,	“a	week	ago	they	were	riding	in	powerful	cars purchased	 by	 crooked	 money.	 They	 wore	 diamonds.	 Nothing	 was	 too	 good	 for their	ladies;	furs,	silks,	jewels.	They	denied	themselves	nothing.	Then,	that	they might	win	still	greater	wealth,	they	kidnaped	a	boy	who	had	nothing,	who	was working	his	way	through	college. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At	 the	 same	 time	 they	 snatched	 a	 defenseless	 girl.	 These	 they	 would	 have murdered	had	it	served	their	purpose.	They	know	no	mercy.	They	deserve	none. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look!”	 came	 the	 announcer’s	 shout	 from	 the	 radio.	 “Look!	 There’s	 the	 Red Rover!	Can	you	beat	that?	You	can’t	even	tie	it!	He	was	kidnaped,	as	you	know, several	days	ago.	The	country	has	been	gone	over	with	a	fine-tooth	comb.	They couldn’t	 find	 him.	 Every	 detective	 in	 the	 country	 was	 on	 the	 trail	 of	 the abductors.	And	now	he	walks	calmly	out	on	the	field	to	take	his	place.	It	can’t	be the	Red	Rover.	It	must	be	his	ghost.	And	yet—yes,	it	is! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen	to	that	crowd	roar!	They’re	standing	up.	All	over	the	stadium	they’re	on their	feet.	Even	Northern	is	applauding.	Good	sports!	What	a	game	this	is	going to	be!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a>And	 it	 was;	 such	 a	 game	 as	 one	 witnesses	 but	 once	 in	 a	 lifetime.	 And	 yet,	 as Drew	 Lane	 and	 Johnny	 Thompson	 sat	 there	 in	 that	 room	 on	 Passage	 Island, looking	 away	 now	 and	 then	 to	 the	 tossing	 waters	 of	 Lake	 Superior,	 listening always	with	all	their	ears,	they	sank	lower	and	lower	in	their	chairs.	Something seemed	to	be	wrong.	The	Red	Rover	could	not	get	going.	Midway’s	hopes	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	centered	on	him.	The	team	had	been	built	around	him.	A	strong	offensive team,	 able	 to	 charge	 the	 line,	 to	 block	 and	 to	 run;	 yet	 always	 as	 he	 followed through	 the	 opening	 made	 for	 him,	 some	 one	 from	 the	 opposing	 team	 broke through	and	downed	him.	Sometimes	they	smeared	him	for	a	loss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	 could	 not	 understand	 this	 himself.	 Had	 the	 opposing	 players	 schooled themselves	so	thoroughly	in	defensive	tactics	that	no	man	could	go	through	for	a touchdown?	In	the	days	away	from	his	team	had	he	grown	soft?	He	hated	those</p>
<p class="calibre1">kidnapers	with	a	bitter	hate;	was	tempted	even	to	hate	old	Ed,	the	scout,	Berley Todd	and	Drew	Lane. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	no!”	he	grumbled	to	himself	once,	as	he	lay	sprawled	upon	the	turf	during</p>
<p class="calibre1">“time	out.”	“‘The	fault,	dear	Brutus,	is	not	in	our	stars	but	in	ourselves	that	we are	 underlings.’	 I’ll	 blame	 no	 other	 one	 than	 myself.	 I’m	 not	 so	 good.	 But	 this once	I	must	win.	I	must!	I	 <i class="calibre3">must</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	could	he?	On	the	defense	his	team	acquitted	itself	well.	During	the	first	half not	a	touchdown	was	made	on	either	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	at	the	very	beginning	of	the	second	half	catastrophe	befell	them.	Midway kicked	off.	Northern	carried	the	ball	to	Midway’s	forty-yard	line.	A	forward	pass was	 completed,	 a	 second	 following	 in	 quick	 succession.	 One	 mad	 plunge,	 and Northern	went	over	for	a	touchdown.	Their	fans	went	mad.	The	kick	for	an	extra point	was	successful.	The	score	stood	Northern	7.	Midway	0. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gloom,	 deep	 and	 ominous,	 settled	 down	 upon	 the	 room	 out	 there	 on	 far	 away Passage	Island.	Gloom,	but	not	for	all.	From	the	corner	came	in	a	loud	whisper:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tony.	 We	 are	 going	 broke	 play	 by	 play.	 Just	 like	 he	 said,	 play	 by	 play.”	 This was	followed	by	a	hoarse	chuckle	that	made	Johnny’s	blood	boil.	If	Drew	Lane heard	it	he	did	not	show	it	by	so	much	as	the	flicker	of	an	eyelash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does	 he	 believe	 that	 the	 Red	 Rover	 can	 still	 go	 through	 to	 victory?”	 Johnny asked	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p169"></a>Then,	as	if	what	appeared	almost	sure	defeat	were	not	enough,	at	the	middle	of the	third	quarter	one	more	terrible	thing	happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	Drew	and	Johnny	it	appeared	all	the	more	terrible	since,	receiving	it	on	the radio,	 they	 could	 but	 half	 understand	 what	 was	 going	 on.	 “Now	 play	 will	 be resumed,”	the	announcer	droned.	“The	men	are	taking	their	positions.	Northern has	the	ball	on	their	own	forty-five	yard	line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 crowd	 is	 on	 its	 toes.	 Seventy	 thousand	 people.	 Bright	 blankets,	 fluttering flags.	Plenty	of	color	out	here.	Plenty	of	noise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Marvelous	 day.	 Clear	 as	 glass.	 Not	 a	 cloud.	 Snappy.	 Just	 the	 kind	 of	 day	 that makes	them	fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	they’re	lined	up.	Now—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh!	Oh!”	There	came	a	sudden	change	in	the	announcer’s	voice.	“Something’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">happening	 down	 there.	 A	 player	 comes	 racing	 onto	 the	 field.	 He’s	 leaping	 at some	one.	Looks	like	the	Red	Rover.	It	 <i class="calibre3">is</i>	the	Red	Rover!	What	do	you	make	of that?	Two	men	of	Old	Midway	fighting	it	out	before	seventy	thousand	witnesses! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	a	tall	youth	in	black	leaps	in.	They’re	piling	up.	What	a	scrap!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 corner	 of	 a	 room	 up	 there	 on	 Passage	 Island	 Tony	 and	 Spike	 stirred uneasily.	 Johnny	 leaned	 far	 forward	 as	 if	 he	 would	 drag	 more	 words	 from	 the radio.	 But	 for	 a	 time	 it	 was	 still.	 Deep	 silence	 fell	 in	 the	 room.	 Drew	 Lane, keeping	a	wary	eye	on	his	prisoners,	waited	for	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	thing	that	had	happened	there	on	Soldiers’	Field	was	scarcely	to	be	credited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom	Howe,	who	had	appointed	himself	bodyguard	for	the	Red	Rover,	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">seated	on	the	bench	near	the	door	leading	from	Old	Midway’s	dressing	rooms.	A youth	 in	 a	 brand	 new	 uniform	 had	 walked	 out	 from	 that	 door,	 had	 stood	 quite still	for	a	moment,	studying	the	field. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looking	for	some	one,”	Tom	told	himself.	Then	he	got	a	good	look	at	the	man’s face,	and	caught	his	breath.	This	fellow	seemed	old	for	an	under-graduate.	There was	about	that	face	a	suggestion	of	long	nights	and	dissipation	such	as	one	does not	see	topping	a	varsity	football	uniform. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks	like	a	tin	horn	gambler!”	Tom	rose	slowly	to	his	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p170"></a>Next	 instant	 the	 stranger	 went	 trotting	 toward	 the	 field.	 It	 was	 a	 nervous	 trot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing	nervous	about	the	man	that	followed	him,	Tom	Howe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	 a	 sudden,	 as	 he	 neared	 the	 group	 of	 players,	 the	 man	 in	 the	 football	 suit, flashing	a	knife,	leaped	at	Red	Rodgers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom	 Howe	 was	 light	 and	 quick.	 With	 a	 panther-like	 leap	 he	 was	 upon	 the mysterious	assassin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Down	they	went.	Rolling	over	and	over,	they	strove	for	possession	of	the	knife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	 Tom	 had	 it.	 Now	 it	 was	 wrenched	 from	 his	 grasp.	 Now	 he	 gripped	 the other’s	wrist.	He	was	fighting	with	the	power	of	desperation,	this	stranger.	Prison bars	yawned	for	him.	He	knew	prison.	He	had	been	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	by	sheer	strength	he	forced	Tom’s	arm	back	until	the	point	of	the	knife	was within	an	inch	of	Tom’s	good	right	eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	me	go!”	hissed	the	dark	assassin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never!”	Tom	set	his	teeth	hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 this	 happened	 in	 the	 space	 of	 seconds.	 Then	 a	 terrific	 blow	 from	 the	 right sent	the	dark	stranger	rolling	over	the	earth.	His	knife	went	spinning	high	in	the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Red	Rover	had	seen.	He	had	understood.	He	had	struck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leaping	 once	 more	 upon	 the	 stranger,	 Tom	 dragged	 him	 to	 his	 feet.	 “You would!”	he	hissed.	“One	more	of	those	‘seventy	thousand	witnesses’	stunts.	But it	don’t	go.	The	hoosegow	for	you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	led	him	from	the	field. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	how	much	of	all	this	the	vast	throng	understood	would	be	hard	to	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 that	 Drew	 and	 Johnny	 got	 over	 the	 radio	 was	 a	 brief	 account	 of	 a	 more	 or less	 mysterious	 fight	 on	 the	 gridiron.	 They	 were	 shrewd	 enough	 to	 understand that	an	attempt	had	been	made	upon	the	Red	Rover’s	life	and	that	quick-witted Tom	Howe	had	saved	the	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p171"></a>“Saved!”	Johnny	breathed.	“Saved!	But	the	score	is	still	7	to	0.	Wonder	how	a football	player	behaves	after	an	attempt	has	been	made	upon	his	life.”	He	was	to see. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p172"></a><b class="calibre4">CHAPTER	XXXIII</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">THE	FLEA	FLICKER</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Paying	me	a	compliment,”	Red	grumbled	to	himself,	as	the	third	quarter	ended with	no	success.	“Tried	to	kill	me,	that	tough	egg	sent	by	Angelo	and	his	gang. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	if	I’d	do	them	any	harm	playing	football!”	He	was	thoroughly	disgusted	with himself.	 What	 was	 the	 trouble?	 He	 could	 not	 get	 going,	 that	 was	 all.	 And	 the game	was	slipping	away,	with	one	more	quarter	to	play. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fourth	quarter	began	as	the	third	had	ended,	with	the	two	teams	driving	one another	back	and	forth	across	the	field.	Eleven	precious	minutes	of	play	passed into	eternity.	Still	no	score.	And	then	came	a	change. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	time	to	time,	as	the	teams	moved	toward	the	center	of	the	field,	Red	had stolen	 a	 glance	 at	 Berley	 Todd.	 She	 had	 not	 been	 home.	 Apparently	 this	 game was,	for	the	time,	all	that	mattered.	As	the	young	football	star	thought	of	this	a lump	rising	in	his	throat	all	but	choked	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somehow	Berley	had	secured	a	place	directly	behind	the	rail	in	the	first	tier	of seats.	 Every	 time	 Red	 stole	 a	 glance	 at	 her	 he	 found	 her	 sitting	 there,	 sober-faced,	 tense,	 expectant.	 She	 did	 not	 leap	 and	 scream	 as	 others	 did.	 She	 did	 not join	in	the	shouting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	 almost	 say	 she	 was	 praying,”	 Red	 told	 himself.	 “Wonder	 if	 any	 one	 ever prayed	at	a	football	game?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Surely	if	ever	there	was	occasion	for	sober	thoughts	over	a	ball	game,	this	was the	time.	A	thousand,	five	thousand,	perhaps	ten	thousand	foolish	men	had	been tricked	into	gambling	on	what	they	believed	to	be	a	sure	thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 don’t	 care	 for	 them,”	 Drew	 Lane	 had	 said.	 “If	 they	 were	 the	 only	 ones	 to suffer	they	should	lose.	But	if	they	 <i class="calibre3">do</i>	lose,	their	families	will	suffer;	women	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p173"></a>children.	So	Red,	you	must	fight!	Fight!  <i class="calibre3">Fight! </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	  <i class="calibre3">had</i>	 fought.	 But	 all	 in	 vain.	 Somehow	 he	 could	 not	 get	 into	 the	 game.	 The very	weight	of	responsibility	seemed	to	crush	the	spirit	out	of	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	four	minutes	before	the	end,	a	strange	thing	happened.	He	was	beyond	the center	 of	 the	 field	 on	 the	 enemy’s	 territory.	 There	 was	 “time	 out.”	 He	 heard	 a thin	voice	calling.	It	was	Berley	Todd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Red,”	 she	 whispered	 hoarsely	 as	 he	 came	 near,	 “why	 don’t	 you	 try	 the	 Flea Flicker?”	Then	she	smiled.	It	was	her	first	smile	that	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 something	 about	 that	 smile	 that	 lifted	 the	 heavy	 burden	 from	 Red’s shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Flea	Flicker.	Why	not?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	described	the	play	to	her	while	on	one	of	their	wild	boat	rides	before	the island. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 Flea	 Flicker.	 Four	 minutes	 to	 play.	 Why	 not?	 Why	 not	 forget	 all	 but	 the game?	 Play	 for	 the	 mere	 sport	 of	 it?	 Football	 is	 sport,	 not	 business.	 The	 Flea Flicker,	that’s	it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	joined	his	team	in	a	huddle.	“The	Flea	Flicker”	was	whispered	from	man	to man.	A	ripple	of	mirth	passed	over	the	weary	fighters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Old	Midway	had	the	ball.	It	was	the	fourth	down.	Four	minutes	to	play.	If	they lost	the	ball	they	might	never	regain	it.	This	play	was	a	complicated	one.	What did	it	matter?	Win	or	lose;	the	Flea	Flicker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Signals	were	called.	Masters,	the	fullback,	dropped	to	the	rear	in	position	for	a place	kick.	Red	sank	to	his	knee	as	if	to	receive	the	ball. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 play	 was	 on.	 The	 ball	 was	 snapped,	 not	 to	 Red	 but	 to	 Masters.	 Northern players	 charged.	 Dwyer,	 the	 right	 half,	 ignoring	 his	 man,	 stood	 up,	 facing Masters.	 Red	 ran	 wide	 to	 the	 right.	 Masters	 pitched	 the	 ball	 to	 Dwyer.	 Dwyer tossed	it	to	Red	and	he	was	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	strange,	the	feeling	that	came	over	Red	Rodgers	as	he	leaped	forward.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p174"></a>was	 not	 on	 a	 football	 field	 dodging	 men,	 but	 on	 the	 water,	 heading	 into	 waves that	threatened	to	swamp	his	frail	craft.	There	was	one	to	the	right,	a	huge	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 way	 out.	 Here	 were	 two	 at	 the	 left.	 A	 quick	 turn	 here,	 a	 short	 twist	 there, and	 he	 was	 on	 again.	 Five,	 ten,	 fifteen,	 twenty,	 twenty-five	 yards,	 he	 raced forward.	The	field	was	clear	now.	The	crowd	was	on	its	feet.	They	were	shouting themselves	 hoarse.	 The	 miracle	 had	 happened.	 The	 Red	 Rover,	 their	 idol,	 was away	at	last. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Touchdown!	Touchdown!”	they	screamed.	And	at	last	Berley	Todd	joined	in	the cry.	“Touchdown!	Touchdown!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Touchdown	it	was.	Then	the	crowd	waited,	breathless,	for	the	kick	that	promised a	tie	or	defeat;	the	crowd	waited	and	lost,	for	the	ball	went	wild.	The	score	stood Northern	7;	Midway	6. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Two	 minutes	 to	 play,”	 Red	 muttered	 to	 himself.	 “Two	 minutes	 are	 enough	 for any	man’s	touchdown.”	But	were	they? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Midway	called	for	“time	out.”	As	the	team	dropped	to	the	ground	one	word	was passed	from	man	to	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 moment’s	 rest	 and	 they	 were	 up	 again.	 A	 hush	 fell	 over	 the	 great	 throng	 as Northern	sent	the	ball	soaring	high. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watching	as	a	hunter	watches	a	hawk,	Red	measured	the	distance,	dashed	a	clean twenty	yards,	gathered	the	ball	in	his	arms	and,	never	pausing,	sped	on	toward the	goal	line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	strange.	Only	half	conscious	of	his	opponents,	he	passed	them	one	by	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	one	leaped	at	his	feet	he	swerved	and	sagged	far	over.	The	man	missed.	Now three	were	bunched	against	him.	They	formed	a	pinwheel.	He	was	at	the	center of	the	wheel.	They	whirled	round	and	round	like	sparks.	They	flew	to	right	and left	 of	 him.	 Again	 he	 sped	 on.	 One	 man	 remained.	 Red	 leaped	 at	 him,	 then stopped	dead.	The	man	went	on	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	 with	 the	 thundering	 roar	 of	 a	 victory	 mad	 throng	 beating	 on	 his	 ears,	 he fell	across	the	line	for	a	touchdown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	 Thompson	 and	 Drew	 Lane,	 away	 up	 on	 Passage	 Island,	 heard	 all	 this, and	greeted	one	another	with	a	solemn	handclasp. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p175"></a>“They	 try	 for	 the	 extra	 point,”	 the	 announcer	 called.	 What	 did	 it	 matter?	 The game	was	won. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	good!	What	matter?	The	score	stands	13	to	7.	One	minute	to	play.	Time	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Red	Rover	is	leaving	the	game.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	did	it	matter?	The	game	was	won. </p>
<p class="calibre1">* 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 * 	 *</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom	Howe’s	mop-up	men	did	their	work	well.	Angelo	the	impostor	and	his	band</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	crooks	and	kidnapers	were	sent	to	jail;	not,	however,	until	their	bank	accounts were	 exhausted,	 their	 safety	 boxes	 emptied,	 paying	 back	 the	 money	 they	 had hoped	to	steal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 a	 pilot	 imported	 from	 Houghton,	 Johnny	 rode	 in	 the	 big	 amphibian	 with Drew’s	prisoners	back	to	the	city.	Drew	rode	alone	in	the	red	racer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	for	Red,	a	cold	shower	woke	him	from	the	half-trance	that	had	carried	him	to victory	in	one	of	the	famous	football	games	of	history.	Two	days	later	he	found himself	 sitting	 before	 a	 small	 fire	 in	 his	 own	 room,	 meditating	 on	 the	 future. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Berley	Todd	had	urged	him	to	visit	her	in	her	father’s	palatial	home.	Would	he go?	 She	 had	 asked	 him	 to	 go	 with	 her	 to	 Isle	 Royale	 in	 the	 good	 old	 summer time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isle	Royale,”	he	murmured.	“The	land	of	dreams.”	Would	he	go? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Grand	Old	Man	was	leaving	football	forever.	Should	he,	too,	leave	and	go back	to	the	steel	mill?	Surely	life	was	strange. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	book	lay	on	his	lap.	It	was	“Burton’s	Analytic	Geometry.”	He	must	dig	in.	He dug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 morning	 after	 his	 return	 Drew	 Lane	 met	 Jimmie	 Drury.	 “Jimmie,”	 he demanded,	“why	did	you	play	the	Galloping	Ghost?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	do	you	know	I	did?”	Jimmie	grinned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on.	Quit	your	kidding!	Own	up!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p176"></a>“Well,	 you	 see,”	 Jimmie’s	 smile	 broadened,	 “it	 happened	 that	 I	 was	 at	 a masquerade	 party	 the	 night	 the	 Red	 Rover	 was	 kidnaped.	 I	 had	 dressed	 as	 a ghost.	I	was	on	my	way	home	when	the	thing	broke.	Got	out	of	my	taxi	and	went after	the	story,	just	as	I	was.	When	the	myth	about	the	Galloping	Ghost	got	out,	I decided	to	continue	the	part.	You	know	the	rest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I	know.	You	helped	a	lot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	a	case	like	that,”	said	Jimmie	soberly,	“every	man	of	us	must	do	his	best.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	 the	 story	 ends.	 There	 will	 be	 another	 called	  <i class="calibre3">Whispers	 at	 Dawn</i>.	 Will	 Drew Lane,	 Johnny,	 and	 the	 others	 walk	 through	 these	 pages?	 Who	 can	 say?	 Time moves	 swiftly.	 Yesterday’s	 hero	 is	 forgotten	 to-day.	 To-morrow	 brings	 another. </p>
