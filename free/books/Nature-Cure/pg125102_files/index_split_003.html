<h2 id="calibre_toc_3" class="calibre4">Chapter II</h2><p class="calibre1">Catechism of Nature Cure</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The philosophy of Nature Cure is based on sciences dealing with newly discovered or rediscovered natural laws and principles, and with their application to the phenomena of life and death, health, disease and cure.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Every new science embodying new modes of thought requires exact modes of expression and new definitions of already well-known words and phrases.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, we have endeavored to define, as precisely as possible, certain words and phrases which convey meanings and ideas peculiar to the teachings of Nature Cure.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The student of Nature Cure and kindred subjects will do well to study these definitions and formulated principles closely, as they contain the pith and marrow of our philosophy and greatly facilitate its understanding.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(1) What Is Nature Cure?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nature Cure is a system of building the entire being in harmony with the constructive principle in Nature on the physical, mental, moral and spiritual planes of being.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(2) What Is the Constructive Principle in Nature?</p>
<p class="calibre1">The constructive principle in Nature is that principle which builds up, improves and repairs, which always makes for the perfect type, whose activity in Nature is designated as evolutionary and constructive and which is opposed to the destructive principle in Nature</p>
<p class="calibre1">(3) What Is the Destructive Principle in Nature?</p>
<p class="calibre1">The destructive principle in Nature is that principle which disintegrates and destroys existing forms and types, and whose activity in Nature is designated as devolutionary and destructive.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(4) What Is Normal or Natural?</p>
<p class="calibre1">That is normal or natural which is in harmonic relation with the life purposes of the individual and the constructive principle in Nature.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(5) What Is Health?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Health is normal and harmonious vibration of the elements and forces composing the human entity on the physical, mental, moral and spiritual planes of being, in conformity with the constructive principle of Nature applied to individual life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(6) What Is Disease?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Disease is abnormal or inharmonious vibration of the elements and forces composing the human entity on one or more planes of being, in conformity with the destructive principle of Nature applied to individual life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(7) What Is the Primary Cause of Disease?</p>
<p class="calibre1">The primary cause of disease, barring accidental or surgical injury to the human organism and surroundings hostile to human life, is violation of Nature’s Laws.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(8) What Is the Effect of Violation of Nature’s Laws on the Physical Human Organism?</p>
<p class="calibre1">The effect of violation of Nature’s Laws on the physical human organism are:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lowered vitality. Abnormal composition of blood and lymph. Accumulation of waste matter, morbid materials and poisons.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These conditions are identical with disease, because they tend to lower, hinder or inhibit normal function (harmonious vibration) and because they engender and promote destruction of living tissues.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(9) What Is Acute Disease?</p>
<p class="calibre1">What is commonly called acute disease is in reality the result of Nature’s efforts to eliminate from the organism waste matter, foreign matter and poisons, and to repair injury to living tissues. In other words, every so-called acute disease is the result of a cleansing and healing effort of Nature. The real disease is lowered vitality, abnormal composition of the vital fluids (blood and lymph) and the resulting accumulation of waste materials and poisons.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(10) What Is Chronic Disease?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chronic disease is a condition of the organism in which lowered vibration (lowered vitality), due to the accumulation of waste matter and poisons, with the consequent destruction of vital parts and organs, has progressed to such an extent that Nature’s constructive and healing forces are no longer able to react against the disease conditions by acute corrective efforts (healing crises). Chronic disease is a condition of the organismin which the morbid encumbrances have gained the ascendancy and prevent acute reaction (healing crises) on the part of the constructive forces of Nature. Chronic disease is the inability of the organism to react by acute efforts or healing crises against constitutional disease conditions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(11) What Is a Healing Crisis?</p>
<p class="calibre1">A healing crisis is an acute reaction, resulting from the ascendancy of Nature’s healing forces over disease conditions. Its tendency is toward recovery, and it is, therefore, in conformity with Nature’s constructive principle.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(12) Are All Acute Reactions Healing Crises?</p>
<p class="calibre1">No, there are healing crises and disease crises.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(13) What Is a Disease Crisis?</p>
<p class="calibre1">A disease crisis is an acute reaction resulting from the ascendancy of disease conditions over the healing forces of the organism. Its tendency is toward fatal termination, and it is, therefore, in conformity with Nature’s destructive principle</p>
<p class="calibre1">(14) What Is Cure?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cure is the readjustment of the human organism from abnormal to normal conditions and functions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(15) What Methods of Cure Are in Conformity with the Constructive Principle in Nature?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Those methods which:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Establish normal surroundings and natural habits of life in accord with Nature’s Laws. Economize vital force. Build up the blood on a natural basis, that is, supply the blood with its natural constituents in right proportions. Promote the elimination of waste matter and poisons without in any way injuring the human body. Arouse the individual in the highest possible degree to the consciousness of personal accountability and the necessity of intelligent personal effort and self-help.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(16) Are Medicines in Conformity with the Constructive Principle in Nature?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Medicines are in conformity with the constructive principle in Nature insofar as they, in themselves, are not injurious and destructive to the human organism and insofar as they act as tissue foods and promote the neutralization and elimination of morbid matter and poisons.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(17) Are Poisonous Drugs and Promiscuous Surgical Operations in Conformity with the Constructive Principle in Nature?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Poisonous drugs and promiscuous operations are not usually in conformity with the constructive principle in Nature, because:</p>
<p class="calibre1">They suppress acute diseases or reactions (crises), the cleaning and healing efforts of Nature. They are in themselves harmful and destructive to human life. Such treatment fosters the belief that drugs and surgical operations can be substituted for obedience to Nature’s Laws and for personal effort and self-help.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(18) Is Metaphysical Healing in Conformity with the Constructive Principle in Nature?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Metaphysical systems of healing are in conformity with the constructive principle in Nature insofar as:</p>
<p class="calibre1">They do not interfere with or suppress Nature’s healing efforts. They awaken hope and confidence (therapeutic faith) and increase the inflow of vital force into the organism.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They are not in conformity with the constructive principle in Nature in so far as:</p>
<p class="calibre1">They fail to assist Nature’s healing efforts. They ignore, obscure and deny the laws of Nature and defy the dictates of reason and common sense. They substitute, in the treatment of disease, a blind, dogmatic belief in the wonder-working power of metaphysical formulas and prayer for intelligent cooperation with Nature’s constructive forces for personal effort and self-help. They weaken the consciousness of personal responsibility.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(19) Is Nature Cure in Conformity with the Constructive Principle in Nature?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nature Cure is in conformity with the constructive principle in Nature because:</p>
<p class="calibre1">It teaches that the primary cause of weakness and disease is disobedience to the laws of Nature. It arouses the individual to the study of natural laws and demonstrates the necessity of strict compliance with these laws. It strengthens the consciousness of personal responsibility of the individual for his own status of health and for the hereditary conditions, traits and tendencies of his offspring. It encourages personal effort and self-help. It adapts surroundings and habits of life to natural laws. It assists Nature’s cleansing and healing efforts by simple natural means and methods of treatment which are in no wise harmful or destructive to health and life, and which are within the reach of everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(20) What Are the Natural Methods of Living and of Treatment?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Return to Nature by the regulation of eating, drinking, breathing, bathing, dressing, working, resting, thinking, the moral life, sexual and social activities, etc., on a normal and natural basis. Elementary remedies, such as water, air, light, earth cures, magnetism, electricity, <i class="calibre2">etc.</i> Chemical remedies, such as scientific food selection and combination, specific nutritional augmentation with natural food concentrates, homeopathic medicines, simple herb extracts and the vitochemical remedies. Mechanical remedies, such as corrective gymnastics, massage, magnetic treatment, chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation and, when indicated, surgery. Mental and spiritual remedies, such as scientific relaxation, normal suggestion, constructive thought, the prayer of faith, <i class="calibre2">etc.</i></p>
