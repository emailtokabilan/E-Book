<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">THE	MIDDLE	WATCH</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 farcical	 comedy	 in	 3	 acts.	 By	 Ian	 Hay	 and	 Stephen	 King-Hall.	 Produced originally	at	the	Times	Square	Theatre,	New	York.	9	males,	6	females.	Modern</p>
<p class="calibre1">costumes	and	naval	uniforms.	2	interior	scenes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During	 a	 reception	 on	 board	 H.	 M.	 S.	 "Falcon,"	 a	 cruiser	 on	 the	 China	 Station,	 Captain	 Randall	 of	 the Marines	has	become	engaged	to	Fay	Eaton,	and	in	his	enthusiasm	induces	her	to	stay	and	have	dinner	in	his cabin.	 This	 is	 met	 with	 stern	 disapproval	 by	 Fay's	 chaperon,	 Charlotte	 Hopkinson,	 who	 insists	 that	 they leave	 at	 once.	 Charlotte,	 however,	 gets	 shut	 up	 in	 the	 compass	 room,	 and	 a	 gay	 young	 American	 widow accepts	the	offer	to	take	her	place,	both	girls	intending	to	go	back	to	shore	in	the	late	evening.	Of	course, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p4"></a>things	go	wrong,	and	they	have	to	remain	aboard	all	night.	By	this	time	the	Captain	has	to	be	told,	because his	cabin	contains	the	only	possible	accommodations,	and	he	enters	into	the	conspiracy	without	signalling the	Admiral's	flagship.	Then	the	"Falcon"	is	suddenly	ordered	to	sea,	and	the	Admiral	decides	to	sail	with her.	This	also	makes	necessary	the	turning	over	to	him	of	the	Captain's	quarters.	The	presence	of	the	ladies now	becomes	positively	embarrassing.	The	girls	are	bundled	into	one	cabin	just	opposite	that	occupied	by the	Admiral.	The	game	of	"general-post"	with	a	marine	sentry	in	stockinged	feet	is	very	funny,	and	so	are the	attempts	to	explain	matters	to	the	"Old	Man"	next	morning.	After	this	everything	ends	both	romantically and	happily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Royalty,	twenty-five	dollars.)	PRICE	75	CENTS. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">NANCY'S	PRIVATE	AFFAIR</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">A	comedy	in	3	acts.	By	Myron	C.	Fagan.	Produced	originally	at	the	Vanderbilt</p>
<p class="calibre1">Theatre,	New	York.	4	males,	5	females.,	2	interior	scenes.	Modern	costumes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing	is	really	private	any	more—not	even	pajamas	and	bedtime	stories.	No	one	will	object	to	Nancy's private	 affair	 being	 made	 public,	 and	 it	 would	 be	 impossible	 to	 interest	 the	 theatre	 public	 in	 a	 more ingenious	 plot.	 Nancy	 is	 one	 of	 those	 smart,	 sophisticated	 society	 women	 who	 wants	 to	 win	 back	 her husband	 from	 a	 baby	 vamp.	 Just	 how	 this	 is	 accomplished	 makes	 for	 an	 exceptionally	 pleasant	 evening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Laying	 aside	 her	 horn-rimmed	 spectacles,	 she	 pretends	 indifference	 and	 affects	 a	 mysterious	 interest	 in other	men.	Nancy	baits	her	rival	with	a	bogus	diamond	ring,	makes	love	to	her	former	husband's	best	friend, and	finally	tricks	the	dastardly	rival	into	a	marriage	with	someone	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Fagan	has	studded	his	story	with	jokes	and	retorts	that	will	keep	any	audience	in	a	constant	uproar. </p>

It	had	been	the	property	of	a	New	York	financier	who	had	disappeared	coincidentally with	 the	 looting	 of	 his	 bank.	 His	 cashier,	 who	 is	 secretly	 engaged	 to	 marry	 Miss	 Van	 Gorder's	 niece,	 is suspected	of	the	defalcation	and	is	a	fugitive.	The	new	occupants	believe	the	place	to	be	haunted.	Strange sounds	 and	 manifestations	 first	 strengthen	 this	 conviction	 but	 presently	 lead	 them	 to	 suspect	 that	 the happenings	are	mysteriously	connected	with	the	bank	robbery.	Any	sensible	woman	would	have	moved	to the	nearest	neighbors	for	the	night	and	returned	to	the	city	next	day.	But	Miss	Van	Gorder	decided	to	remain and	 solve	 the	 mystery.	 She	 sends	 for	 detectives	 and	 then	 things	 begin	 to	 happen.	 At	 one	 time	 or	 another every	 member	 of	 the	 household	 is	 suspected	 of	 the	 theft.
