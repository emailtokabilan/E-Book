<p class="calibre1">The	Interactive	Fiction	(IF)	genre	describes	text-based	narrative	experiences in	which	a	person	interacts	with	a	computer	simulation	by	typing	text	phrases (usually	commands	in	the	imperative	mood)	and	reading	software-generated	text responses	(usually	statements	in	the	second	person	present	tense).	Re-examining historical	and	contemporary	IF	illuminates	the	larger	fields	of	electronic literature	and	game	studies.	Intertwined	aesthetic	and	technical	developments	in IF	from	1977	to	the	present	are	analyzed	in	terms	of	language	(person,	tense,	and mood),	narrative	theory	(Iser’s	gaps,	the	fabula	 <i class="calibre3">sjuzet	distinction),	game	studies</i> ludology	(player	apprehension	of	rules,	evaluation	of	strategic	advancement), and	filmic	representation	(subjective	POV,	time-loops).	Two	general methodological	concepts	for	digital	humanities	analyses	are	developed	in relation	to	IF:	implied	code,	which	facilitates	studying	the	interactor’s	mental model	of	an	interactive	work;	and	frustration	aesthetics,	which	facilitates analysis	of	the	constraints	that	structure	interactive	experiences.	IF	works interpreted	in	extended	“close	interactions”	include	Plotkin’s	Shade	(1999), Barlow’s	Aisle	(2000),	Pontious’s	Rematch	(2000),	Foster	and	Ravipinto’s Slouching	Towards	Bedlam	(2003),	and	others.	Experiences	of	these	works	are mediated	by	implications,	frustrations,	and	the	limiting	figures	of	their protagonists. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Foreword:	Foreclosure	and	Interactive	Fiction</p>
<p class="calibre1">This	study	aspires	to	increase	the	awareness	and	appreciation	of	interactive fiction	in	the	new	media	arts	and	the	humanities.	To	that	end	it	forwards	a	few general	theories	of	that	command	line	genre,	as	well	as	a	number	of	exemplary contemporary	works	worthy	of	close	study.	The	theories	generally	focus	on	how interactive	fiction	is	experienced	as	a	phenomenon	of	discovery	and understanding;	the	examples	highlight	how	contemporary	works	have	explored and	refined	this	mode	of	play	with	the	player’s	knowledge.	One	consequence	of these	arguments	is	that	much	is	made	of	analyzing	experiences	as	they	are discovered.	Yet	if	you	have	not	already	explored	a	variety	of	interactive	fiction (and	most	people	have	not),	this	puts	the	examples	in	the	awkward	position	of murdering	to	dissect	the	process	of	exploration	and	discovery.	This	foreword’s meditation	on	spoilers	and	foreclosure	serves	both	as	a	gentle	warning	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>potential	readers	of	this	study	and	as	a	brief	discussion	of	what	in	this	situation	is unique	to	the	given	subject	of	interactive	fiction	works. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Spoilers’	are	statements	that	reveal	the	crucial	details	of	fictional	media	to potential	audiences.	These	details	may	be	of	any	kind,	and	indeed	the	effect	may be	undesired	(as	with	a	review	that	reveals	some	climactic	secret)	or	desirable (as	with	a	players	guide	to	a	quest	video	game).	Regardless,	the	effects	are	most acutely	felt	whenever	they	preempt	the	progressive	revelation	of	the	work,	often by	resolving	some	central	mystery	before	it	can	be	engaged,	whether	in	drama, literature,	cinema	or	new	media.	How	might	Birnam	wood	move	against Macbeth?	Who	committed	the	murder	on	the	Orient	Express?	What	happened	to Luke	Skywalker’s	father?	How	can	the	Prince	of	Persia	defeat	his	shadow-self? </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	the	uninitiated,	the	true	danger	is	not	that	answers	might	reduce	the	pleasures of	revelation,	but	that	answers	might	excise	revelation	entirely.	Wherever questions	are	fundamental	to	the	experience	of	the	work,	answers	prevent	a questing	motion	of	the	mind	that	the	work	might	otherwise	encourage,	and	thus answers	prevent	the	work	itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	normal	for	mysteries	in	art	to	end	in	discoveries,	as	energy	accumulates around	the	gaps	in	the	mind	between	knowns,	remaining	potential	until,	in	a sudden	synaptic	arc,	a	connection	is	made:	closure.	A	spoiler	is	merely	a	special type	of	closure,	which	I	will	term	foreclosure.	External	and	prior	rather	than internal	and	concurrent,	foreclosures	perform	in	themselves	the	act	of	resolving the	gap,	and	in	doing	so	preempt	the	reader’s	performance.	The	site	of	potential energy	is	short-circuited	before	engagement	with	the	work	even	begins.	While the	potential	for	foreclosure	is	implicit	any	time	the	uninitiated	consider	a	work from	a	distance,	the	concept	of	the	“spoiler”	as	a	threat	to	experience	is	most relevant	addressing	potential	audiences,	as	do	book	and	film	reviews	or introductions	to	unfamiliar	genres.	Even	then,	foreclosures	are	taken	most seriously	in	domains	where	the	process	of	exploration	and	discovery	is	held	to be	central	to	the	experience	of	the	work	itself,	as	for	example	in	mystery, suspense,	riddles,	or	jokes.	This	is	true	across	media	forms	such	as	theatre, literature,	and	film.	This	is	also	true	in	the	case	of	interactive	media	such	as video	games.	Foreclosure	is	more	consequential	for	the	experience	of	Zork (whose	progresses	and	pleasures	depend	largely	on	puzzles	and	mysteries)	than it	is	for	Space	Invaders	(whose	progresses	and	pleasures	depend	largely	on reflexes	and	technique). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	1.	The	hero	Wander	charges	to	climb	the	leg	of	Valus	in	the	video	game</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>Shadow	of	the	Colossus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	distinct	types	of	foreclosure	affect	interactive	media.	The	type	described thus	far	is	conceptual	foreclosure.	For	example,	Fumito	Ueda’s	3D	video	game Shadow	of	the	Colossus	(2005)	presents	a	young	hero,	Wander,	who	begs	an ancient	spirit	to	revive	a	dead	girl.	To	ransom	her	life,	the	hero	(and,	by extension,	the	player)	is	told	to	hunt	and	destroy	a	pantheon	of	magical	stone creatures	called	colossi,	yet	not	told	why	the	colossi	exist,	or	to	what	end	they must	be	destroyed.	While	this	mystery	is	resolved	at	the	conclusion	of	the	game, uncertainty,	ambivalence,	and	doubt	about	the	hero’s	goals	are	what	give	the work	part	of	its	peculiar	and	powerful	emotional	force.	Much	as	in	a	film, foreclosing	this	uncertainty	for	the	player	in	advance	of	play	would	change	the work,	particularly	the	desire	for	and	fear	of	outcomes	that	might	color	the player’s	labors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	second	type	of	foreclosure	that	can	affect	Shadow	of	the	Colossus	is procedural	foreclosure.	The	colossi	are	antagonists,	but	they	are	also	mysteries, in	that	each	one	must	be	first	located	in	a	vast	landscape	and	then	undone	by discovering	and	exploiting	a	series	of	physical	and	behavioral	weaknesses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Acting	as	the	hero,	the	player	must	locate,	observe,	and	engage	with	the	colossi, often	culminating	in	physically	traversing	the	terrain-like	expanses	of	their	vast bodies.	Colossi	can	only	be	destroyed	once	interaction	with	them	has	been explored	to	the	point	that	they	are	truly	understood	for	what	they	are	�	more majestic	than	terrible,	and	more	bestial	than	monstrous.	This	intimacy	may	lead the	player	into	identification	with	the	colossi,	and	is	part	of	what	transforms	each expected	triumph	into	a	loss.	While	mastery	is	the	goal,	the	outcome	of	a collapsing	colossus	is	a	sobering	spectacle	of	exterminating	the	sublime,	evoking an	atmosphere	of	wistful	melancholy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Procedural	foreclosure	displaces	this	active	process	of	coming	into understanding,	as	for	example	when	the	player	learns	in	advance	of	initial	play the	optimal	method	for	locating	and	destroying	each	colossus	(as	with	a	guide, tutorial,	or	review).	Procedural	foreclosure	changes	both	the	play	technique	and the	resulting	procedures	of	the	interactive	experience,	and	thus	changes	those aesthetic	affects	that	arise	procedurally.	In	the	case	of	Shadow	of	the	Colossus, optimally	guided	play	shortens	the	length	of	the	work	dramatically	by	omitting exploration	in	every	sense.	Forewarned	and	forearmed,	an	epic	half-hour struggle	to	subdue	a	creature	fighting	for	its	life	becomes	30	seconds	of	precise and	perfunctory	execution	�	an	encounter	with	Moby-Dick	revisited	by</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>contemporary	commercial	whale-harvesters.	As	with	a	viewing	of	The	Empire Strikes	Back	prefaced	by	the	identity	of	Luke’s	father,	the	aesthetic	experience of	the	work	may	be	changed.	Unlike	the	film	watcher,	however,	the	player	of Shadow	of	the	Colossus	additionally	creates	and	witnesses	a	different	work	�	a shorter	work	largely	cleansed	of	both	mystery	and	the	learning	process. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Spoilers	are	not	a	normal	anxiety	for	those	writing	literary	and	art	criticism, which	is	generally	intended	for	readers	who	are	already	familiar	with	the	objects of	study.	To	the	extent	that	criticism	is	concerned	with	engaging	crucial	detail, avoiding	spoilers	may	in	fact	be	beyond	its	power	to	achieve.	As	the	forgoing rumination	on	foreclosure	suggests,	however,	the	preemptive	understanding	of interactive	works	imparted	by	criticism	is	almost	unavoidably	destructive,	both in	the	aesthetic	sense	and	in	the	way	it	excises	the	experiences	of	ambiguity, exploration,	and	frustration.	Where	works	are	constituted	by	what	the	player does	not	yet	know,	as	with	mystery	and	suspense,	this	prevents	the	work.	That	is the	dual	warning	and	insight	of	this	foreword,	which	will	now	place	its conclusion	(and	the	entire	rest	of	this	study)	under	the	following	banner: <i class="calibre3">SPOILERS	WARNING</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	we	already	know	that	Darth	Vader	is	Luke’s	father,	we	cannot experience	the	lead	up	to	their	confrontation	in	The	Empire	Strikes	Back	in	the same	state	of	mind.	Nor	can	we	guide	the	hero	of	Shadow	of	the	Colossus against	the	colossi	of	the	forbidden	land	in	the	same	state	of	mind	once	we	know that	his	true	task	is	to	release	the	fragments	of	a	dark	soul	from	captivity,	and that	each	victory	over	a	colossus	leads	the	hero	one	step	closer	to	a	terrible demonic	possession.	Further,	while	we	can	appreciate	the	hero’s	single-minded bravery,	we	cannot	fully	appreciate	the	tragic	quality	of	his	heroism	unless	we have	struggled	with	him,	becoming	complicit	in	somehow	overcoming	the overwhelming	odds	that	separate	him	from	his	doom.	This	is	an	ergodics	of guilt,	and	the	heights	of	effort	that	the	player	achieves	on	behalf	of	the	doomed hero	are	what	lend	weight	to	the	corresponding	depths	of	their	eventual	betrayal, and	together	these	procedural	and	conceptual	closures	make	up	the	meaning	of the	work.	When	the	hero	is	finally	consumed	by	darkness	and	rises	again	as	the incarnation	of	the	shadowy	Dormin,	the	game	camera	takes	up	position	over	the shoulder	of	the	massive	creature,	and	the	player	is	given	control	for	the	first	time of	a	massive	figure	(majestic,	terrible,	and	doomed)	with	a	sense	of	recognition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	hero	has	become	the	uncanny	double	of	his	victims,	and	we	know	that	this fate,	however	little	it	is	to	be	desired,	has	been	earned.	At	the	last	the	player</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>must	control	a	monstrosity	whose	defeat	is	the	victory	condition	of	the	game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	2.	Possessed	by	Dormin,	the	doomed	hero	Wander	attacks	four	soldiers (upper	right)	as	a	dark	colossus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	do	Shadow	of	the	Colossus	and	interactive	fiction	have	to	do	with	each other?	Quite	a	lot.	While	the	cinematic	sensibilities	and	dramatic	pacing	of	the game	all	conspire	to	make	it	affecting,	the	game	is	exceptional	where	it	uses interaction	to	make	the	player	complicit	in	a	progression	of	mysteries,	reversals, and	revelations.	This	design	pattern	is	the	essential	difference	in	the	design	of Shadow	of	the	Colossus	that	caused	a	sensation	in	2005,	and	it	is	also	the	very essence	of	what	contemporary	literary	IF	has	been	exploring	for	the	previous two	decades.	When	we	return	to	the	groundbreaking	work	about	the	self-defeating	transformation	of	a	protagonist	into	a	specter,	it	won’t	be	Shadow.	It will	be	the	2000	interactive	fiction	called	Shade. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This	dissertation	undertakes	a	study	of	the	genre	called	“interactive	fiction” </p>
<p class="calibre1">(or	‘IF’),	a	text-based	narrative	experience	in	which	a	person	interacts	with	a computer	software	simulation	by	alternately	typing	text	phrases	(generally	a command	in	the	imperative	mood)	and	reading	software-generated	text responses	(generally	a	statement	in	the	second	person	present	tense).	The primary	focus	in	this	study	is	the	intertwined	aesthetic	and	technical developments	of	the	genre	of	IF	from	its	emergence	in	the	1970s	to	the	present. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	particular,	this	study	addresses	the	large	body	of	almost	unexamined	works	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>IF	written	in	the	past	decade	and	their	turn	away	from	the	simulation	of challenging	environments	and	towards	the	exploration	of	computational narration.	These	thousands	of	recent	independent	works,	some	challenging, sophisticated	and	beautiful,	have	remained	largely	invisible	in	recent	new	media and	games	scholarship,	which	instead	repeatedly	cites	a	very	few	commercial works	from	the	early	1980s.	Given	the	vast	scope	of	this	lacuna	in	new	media criticism,	a	complete	survey	of	IF	or	even	a	complete	survey	of	contemporary	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	outside	the	scope	of	this	project.	Nevertheless,	a	study	of	the	genre	as exemplified	by	selected	contemporary	authors	is	certainly	in	order,	and	this study	takes	up	close	analyses	of	the	works	of	Sam	Barlow,	Adam	Cadre,	Jon Ingold,	Nick	Montfort,	Andrew	Plotkin,	Andrew	Pontious,	and	Emily	Short, among	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	we	have	to	gain	from	a	critical	study	of	IF	goes	far	beyond	canonical supplement,	and	straight	to	the	heart	of	how	many	fields	have	attempted	to define	and	create	taxonomies	of	digital	new	media	arts.	IF	is	something	of	a problem	child	for	studies	of	games,	hypertext	fiction,	and	electronic	literature, and	part	of	the	interest	in	studying	IF	arises	precisely	out	of	the	difficulty	one encounters	when	attempting	to	assimilate	it	under	most	current	categories, typologies,	and	theories	of	new	media.	The	lack	of	critical	engagement	with	real works	of	IF,	in	other	words,	may	not	be	entirely	oversight,	but	may	in	part	arise out	of	exactly	these	difficulties	in	addressing	the	question	“What	is	IF?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	is	IF?	The	question	requires	quite	a	bit	of	unpacking,	and	this	can	begin with	the	formal	and	procedural	questions,	“What	are	the	mechanisms	of	IF?”	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	the	process	of	IF?”	In	general,	the	process	of	exploring	an	IF	work occurs	through	a	recurrent	cycle	of	text	generation,	alternating	in	turn	between the	software	program	and	the	software	user,	or	‘interactor,’	both	referencing	the same	simulated	world.	At	the	computer	screen	prompt,	also	known	as	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">“command	line”	(‘&gt;’),	the	interactor	types	a	phrase,	generally	in	the	command tense	(“&gt;	READ	THE	DISSERTATION”)	and	the	program	attempts	to	parse	the command	with	regards	to	the	simulated	world	(perform	the	read	action	on	the dissertation	object),	acts	out	any	results	in	the	simulated	world	(move	the dissertation	object	into	the	possession	of	the	protagonist	object)	and	then narrates	what	has	happened	to	the	interactor,	generally	in	the	second	person (“You	open	the	dissertation	to	the	first	page,	and	begin	to	read….”)	before	the process	begins	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	3.	Above:	The	opening	screen	of	Blank	and	Lebling’s	Zork	I	(1981). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>Below:	The	interface	to	Cadre’s	Lock	&amp;	Key	(2002). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those	readers	unfamiliar	with	objects	as	detailed	above	must	remember	that, as	in	any	critical	engagement	with	media	art,	caveat	lector:	reading	criticism cannot	substitute	for	direct	engagement	with	these	works.	The	description	may be	helpful,	but	in	the	end	may	only	be	marginally	more	helpful	then	describing	a film	to	someone	who	has	never	experienced	one	as	“the	rapid	superimposition	of photographs”	or	a	comic	as	“the	spatial	juxtaposition	of	images.”	What	is	elided from	such	descriptions	is	the	experience	of	the	medium:	the	way	that	rapid superimposition	simulates	motion,	or	the	manner	of	reading	spatial	juxtaposition that	creates	a	simulation	of	time	and	space.	So	too	in	IF,	technical	and	procedural descriptions	tend	to	elide	the	crucial	fact	of	how	the	command	line	prompt enables	exploration	and	acts	as	a	locus	of	experience:	that	it	marks	a	gap between	what	the	interactor	knows	and	does	not	know,	that	it	is	a	site	of	closure and	coming	into	understanding,	and	that	the	result	synthesizes	the	thesis	of	the program’s	narration	with	the	antithesis	of	the	interactor’s	interrogation.	The	heart of	this	study’s	approach	to	IF	is	this	model	of	the	command	line,	a	site	of negotiation	between	the	actual	code	of	the	simulation	and	the	“implied	code”	of the	interactor’s	conception.	This	model	of	exploration	through	interrogation builds	on	earlier	critical	models	of	IF	as	a	roleplay,	a	participation,	a	drama,	a conversation,	a	cybernetic	feedback	loop,	or	a	series	of	riddles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These	terms	‘interactor,’	‘exploration,’	and	‘interrogation’	may	seem metaphorical	but	have	been	proposed	here	with	some	care.	The	interactor	is,	as many	have	remarked,	neither	a	reader	nor	a	writer,	neither	a	speaker	nor	a listener	(Montfort,	Murray).	While	engaging	IF	she	does	read,	and	also	types (and	so,	in	a	loose	sense,	writes),	and	might	even	be	said	to	‘wread.’	This	total process	in	IF	is	best	described	as	exploration.	In	the	general	sense,	‘explore’</p>
<p class="calibre1">captures	the	spirit	of	reader	response	theory	that	Louise	Rosenblatt	termed</p>
<p class="calibre1">“literature	as	exploration”	in	1938.	In	the	more	literal	sense,	‘explore’	reflects the	new	media	theory	that	J.	David	Bolter	and	Michael	Joyce	used	in	1987	when they	described	navigating	hypertext	fiction	links	as	exploring	a	“garden	of forking	paths”	(6),	and	perhaps	a	mode	of	engagement	appropriate	to	almost	any text	we	might	term	‘ergodic.’	Unlike	most	hypertext	fictions,	most	IF	employ	a spatial	rather	than	topical	metaphor	(in	that	many	individual	exchanges	produce substitutions	of	text	that	correspond	to	movement	through	simulated	space,	not associated	topics),	and	thus	are	explored	in	the	more	pragmatic	sense	of	explore:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“travel	through	an	unfamiliar	area	in	order	to	familiarize	oneself	with	it.”	But most	importantly,	to	engage	with	IF	is	to	‘explore’	in	the	most	literal	sense	of	its</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>Latin	derivation,	ex-plorare:	“to	cry	out.”	IF	proceeds,	if	it	proceeds	at	all,	as	a result	of	outcry	�	utterances,	typed	by	the	interactor,	that	produce	in	response	a growing	familiarity	with	the	simulated	landscape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	the	results	of	these	utterances	in	IF	are	typically	a	kind	of	reading	I	term</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘exploration,’	the	utterances	themselves	are	typically	a	kind	of	writing	I	term</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘interrogation,’	in	that	they	are	both	forceful	imperatives	in	the	command	tense and,	at	the	same	time,	questions.	The	first	time	an	interactor	types	“OPEN	THE</p>
<p class="calibre1">MAILBOX”	she	is	also	implicitly	asking	“(CAN	I)	OPEN	THE	MAILBOX</p>
<p class="calibre1">(?)”.	The	process	of	an	interrogation	is	a	special	kind	of	imperative	asking, focused	only	on	eliciting	information.	It	is	asking	precisely	in	that	it	can	easily be	and	routinely	is	denied	(“The	mailbox	is	rusted	shut.	Perhaps	if	you	had oil….”),	and,	like	the	cross-examining	lawyer	who	says	“I	put	it	to	you,”	the command	tense	of	IF	is	both	strident	and	essentially	impotent.	Restated	loosely in	terms	of	speech	acts	from	J.	L.	Austin’s	1955	lectures	How	to	Do	Things	with Words,	the	IF	interactor	constantly	attempts	to	make	declarative	performative utterances	(to	say	things,	thereby	making	them	so),	but	often	without	the	ability to	judge	whether	they	will	be	‘happy’	or	rather	flawed	infelicities.	In	question	is whether	interactions	will	be	an	accepted	procedure	(“I	do	not	know	how	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘open’”),	whether	in	that	case	they	will	be	executed	properly	and	completely (“You	can	only	‘open’	something	with	something	else”),	whether	once	accepted they	will	be	disallowed	or	vitiated	(“As	you	grasp	the	mailbox	lid,	the	hot	metal causes	you	to	jerk	your	hand	back”)	and	so	forth.	Austin’s	study	of	infelicities	in speech	acts	maps	in	a	fascinating	way	onto	the	common	methods	of	rule execution	and	error	handling	used	in	IF	systems,	perhaps	in	part	due	to	their shared	concern	with	how	one	adjudicates	the	tenuous	connections	between unruly	language	and	some	model	of	the	real.	These	judgments,	which	for	Austin were	resolved	by	the	negotiations	of	cultural	context	and	public	opinion	as	much as	by	the	parties	themselves,	are	in	the	case	of	IF	adjudicated	by	the	software system.	As	useful	as	it	is,	speech	act	theory	can	lead	us	into	an	error	in imagining	the	encounter	at	the	command	line	as	conversational,	when	it	is precisely	the	asymmetry	just	outlined	that	makes	it	least	like	a	conversation	and most	like	an	interrogation.	The	sworn	witness	in	a	cross-examination	answers	at the	direction	of	the	prosecutor,	but	(in	theory)	cannot	be	led,	and	is	(unlike	the prosecutor)	the	sole	producer	of	admissible	testimony.	Such	is	the	case	with	the IF	system	at	the	direction	of	the	interactor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	difficult	to	choose	a	critical	terminology	and	situate	the	study	of	IF	in digital	media	without	privileging	either	an	Electronic	Literature	or	a	Games</p>

Ludology	is	a	theoretical approach	to	the	study	of	games	with	a	primary	emphasis	on	the	operation	of video	game	rules,	and	setting	it	in	opposition	to	the	approach	of	its	narratologist forebears	was	a	largely	unproductive	exploration	of	applying	the	false	dilemma</p>
<p class="calibre1">“rules,	or	stories?”	to	a	host	of	complex	problem.	This	is	particularly	vexing when	dealing	with	rule-based	objects	that	narrate,	as	with	IF.	What	to	call	such objects?	Nick	Montfort	raises	a	number	of	options	just	in	the	title	of	his	2004</p>

<p class="calibre1">Asking	whether	a	new	media	artifact	is	a	story	or	a	game	is	like	asking	of	a poem:	“Which	is	it?	Narrative	or	metrical?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">IF	provides	an	excellent	example	of	a	specific	genre	poorly	served	by	the assumption	that	eliterature	and	games	are	exclusive	areas	of	inquiry	demanding strictly	partitioned	approaches	and	terminologies.	IF	objects	are	sometimes games	that	are	played,	and	sometimes	stories	that	are	read,	and	often	both	or neither.	Further,	their	narrative	and	rule	aspects	interact	continuously	at	a	deep level.	For	this	reason,	the	IF	‘work’	and	its	‘interactor’	will	be	described throughout	this	study,	not	to	deny	the	importance	either	of	the	game	player	or	of the	electronic	literature	reader,	but	to	establish	a	more	fundamental	baseline	for critical	discussion	of	IF	operations	in	terms	of	both	rule	structures	and	narrative operations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	describing	interacting	with	IF	works	in	terms	of	exploration	and interrogation	(wandering	outcry	and	forceful	asking),	I’ve	tried	to	mark	a	new path	across	well-trod	territory,	beginning	in	form	and	process	before	passing through	on	the	way	towards	an	understanding	of	affective	experience.	The description	of	IF	as	form	and	process	is	something	of	a	fixture	in	popular introductions	to	the	genre	(e.g.	Firth	&amp;	Kesserich,	Shiovitz,	Short,	Nelson), dissertations,	theses,	and	monographs	on	the	genre	(e.g.	Buckles,	Maher, Montfort,	Sloan)	and	critical	surveys	of	electronic	literature,	games,	and	new media	more	broadly	(e.g.	Aarseth,	Murray).	All	of	these	have	in	common	the need	to	reach	out	to	a	reader	unfamiliar	with	the	medium	�	an	obligation	and	an opportunity	that	critical	studies	of	novels	or	films	do	not	often	share.	The	best scholarly	answers	to	the	question	“What	is	IF?”	have	tended	towards	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>provisional	and	composite,	covering	aspects	such	as	form	(hardware,	software architecture,	and	interface),	process	(methods	of	engaged	conversation <i class="calibre3">exploration	</i> interaction	 <i class="calibre3">participation	</i> play),	genre	(often	narrowly	understood	as themes	present	in	typical	or	archetypical	works),	and	history	(invention, commercial	boom	/	bust,	and	independent	era).	If	such	composites	have	been diverse	in	their	approaches,	however,	they	have	also	been	fairly	uniform	in	their limitations:	too	many	have	placed	emphasis	on	incomplete	historical	sketches	of IF	circa	1980-1985,	and	several	of	the	most	influential	have	incorrectly proclaimed	IF	to	be	a	‘dead’	genre	(e.g.	Aarseth,	Yellowlees	Douglas),	usually with	the	mystifying	justification	that	contemporary	IF	does	not	sell.	This suggests	comparison	to	chapbooks	of	poetry,	for	if	sales	are	to	be	the	new standard	for	‘living’	genres,	then	language	arts	and	new	media	arts	are	both	in serious	trouble.	Yet	while	these	critical	accounts	of	the	history	of	IF	are	often factually	incorrect,	even	the	recent	renaissance	in	(corrective)	IF	historical scholarship	has	shared	some	of	their	deepest	assumptions,	and	as	such	partially obscures	IF	from	view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IF	is	history! </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	recent	years,	the	understanding	of	IF	has	experienced	a	quiet	revolution	in the	meticulous	research	of	Jerz,	Montfort,	and	Maher.	Their	works	have	revised and	expanded	the	history	of	the	genre	into	a	generally	uncontested	sequence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taken	together	with	public	histories	such	as	Graham	Nelson’s	“A	short	history	of interactive	fiction”	(2001)	and	community	records	such	as	Stephan	and	Misty Granade’s	“A	Brief	History	of	Interactive	Fiction”	(2002)	all	recent	histories suggest	a	generally	shared	periodization.	This	introduction	cannot	recapitulate the	entirety	of	their	findings	on	the	history	of	IF,	but	it	can	synthesize	this periodization	for	the	purpose	of	critique:</p>
<p class="calibre1">*	1975	Origin:	IF	began	when	Will	Crowther,	working	in	his	spare	time,	wrote	a spelunking	simulation	of	a	real	Kentucky	cave	for	his	two	daughters.	The	file, named	“ADVENT”	(a.k.a.	Adventure)	was	written	in	FORTRAN	on	his	work’s timesharing	PDP-10	computer.	Publicly	available	on	ARPANET,	the	game became	a	sensation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	1976	Coauthorship:	Don	Woods	discovered	Adventure	and,	with	permission and	source	from	Crowther,	revised	/	expanded	the	work	substantially.	His	major influence	is	generally	agreed	to	have	been	shifting	the	emphasis	from	spelunking to	a	fantasy	treasure	hunt. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>*	1977	Folk	Art:	So	dubbed	by	Buckles	in	1985,	the	Crowther	/	Woods Adventure	is	widely	ported	and	imitated,	including	by	a	group	at	the	MIT</p>
<p class="calibre1">Laboratory	for	Computer	Science	who	later	found	Infocom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	1978-1980	Commercial	Games:	Scott	Adams	programs	the	loose	adaptation Adventureland,	which	becomes	the	first	commercial	software	game	when	he takes	out	a	small	mail	order	ad	in	a	computer	magazine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	1980-1985	Corporate	Games:	On-Line	Systems	(later	Sierra	On-Line)	and Infocom	both	release	games,	with	other	companies	(Level	9,	Synapse,	etc.) following.	Infocom	rises	to	prominence	as	a	mass-market	phenomenon	and dominates	the	computer	game	software	and	publications	industries	for	five years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	1985-1991	Defunding	(The	Crash):	Bankruptcy	and	closure	for	IF	companies Adventure	International	(1985),	Infocom	(1986-89),	Level	9	(1989-91)	and finally	Magnetic	Scrolls	(1992).	In	1993	“Gateway	II:	Homeworld”	is	the	last commercial	game	widely	released	by	a	studio	which	is	entirely	parser-driven (Grenade). </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	1991-2005	Independent	/	Community	Era:	Mature	IF	development	languages like	TADS	and	Inform	circulate	widely	on	Usenet	and	noncommercial authorship	rises	in	conjunction	with	a	culture	of	public	archives,	craft discussions,	critical	reviews	and	ratings,	and	awards	ceremonies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	is	radical	in	the	accounts	synthesized	here	is	not	only	their	accuracy compared	to	earlier	writings	but	also	their	inclusion	and	account	of	the	final Independent	/	Community	Era.	Individual	histories	vary	in	their	divisions.	The Granades	choose	1991	as	the	transitional	year	to	independence,	whereas Montfort	writes	more	expansively	that	“the	still-growing	community	of interactive	fiction	authors	first	really	began	to	demonstrate	the	vitality	of	the form	in	the	1990s,	innovating	in	ways	that	early	hackers	and	later	game companies	did	not”	(193).	Montfort’s	book	chapter	divisions	“Adventure	and	Its Ancestors,”	“Infocom	and	Commercial	Beginnings,”	and	“The	Independents” </p>
<p class="calibre1">follow	this	general	formulation	of	hackers,	companies,	and	independents, although	he	also	provides	meticulous	pre-histories	that	suggest	complications	to each	category.	Did	the	independent	era	begin	when	published	noncommercial output	outstripped	the	flagging	corporations?	Was	it	in	1987,	when	the independent	“InfoTaskForce”	group	reverse	engineered	Infocom’s	Z-machine	, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>guaranteeing	a	continuity	of	texts	and	techniques	that	would	nurture	the generation	after	the	commercial	crash?	Or	was	it	in	1983,	with	the	release	of Graeme	Yeandle’s	IF	authorware	The	Quill	/	Adventure	Writer? </p>
<p class="calibre1">These	questions	suggest	a	new	way	of	telling	of	the	history	of	IF	that	is	quite distinct	from	the	approach	of	Montfort	or	the	Granades,	holding	that	the	Folk	Art and	Independent	eras	are,	in	fact,	one	continuous	and	inseparable	period,	running from	1975	to	the	present,	and	characterized	by	a	broadly	shared	set	of	production and	consumption	practices	that	made	similar	uses	of	mainframes	/	ARPANET</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Usenet	</i> the	Internet	for	the	open	and	free	distribution	of	IF	programs	and	their source	codes.	Should	IF	be	understood	in	terms	of	a	failed	relationship	to	the model	of	publishing?	Perhaps	it	could	instead	be	represented	as	an	ongoing successful	relationship	to	the	model	of	network	distribution,	or	to	the	set	of logics	Alexander	Galloway	terms	“protocol.”	The	commercialization	of	IF,	while foundational	for	the	later	commercial	computer	games	industry,	can	be	recast	in this	telling	as	an	important	anomaly,	a	brief	big-business	deviation	from	the otherwise	constant	association	of	the	IF	genre	with	individual	authors	each networked	into	a	kind	of	literary	salon	culture.	Indeed,	as	we	focus	on	this version	it	quickly	becomes	unclear	whether	business	production	methods	were ever	strongly	deviated	from	the	methods	of	the	earlier	folk	era	or	the	later independent	era:	a	single	author	laboring	for	some	months,	with	perhaps	the	help of	a	few	volunteer	beta-testers.	In	fact,	at	the	absolute	apex	of	the	corporate	era, Infocom	appeared	to	adopt	a	model	much	more	like	the	working	method	of Crowther	in	1976	or	Plotkin	in	1996	than	it	was	like	the	massive	team-based approach	of	a	film	studio	or	video	game	production	house.	In	an	interview, founder	Dave	Lebling	recalls	“Infocom	had	putting	out	games	down	to	a science:	a	team	consisted	of	one	author,	one	interpreter,	and	some	QA	[…]	and we	could	bring	a	game	to	market	in	nine	months”	(Briceno	 <i class="calibre3">et	al. </i>	2000). </p>

<p class="calibre1">“IF	is	History!	Interactive	Fiction	in	the	News”	(2006),	there	have	been hundreds	of	feature	articles	on	IF	run	in	periodicals	over	last	decade,	most reporting	the	generally	received	wisdom	that	IF	“was	killed	by	the	graphics card.”	This	techno-Darwinian	factoid	has	been	repeated	in	technology-beat circles	to	the	point	where	Infocom’s	downfall	has	become	wrapped	up	in	a	kind of	urban	legend,	the	tragedy	of	a	once-proud	digital	genre	laid	low.	As	tragedy, the	tale	can	only	be	recounted	in	a	tone	of	appropriate	nostalgia	and	mourning, as	in	this	typical	opener	for	Andy	Klien’s	article	“War	of	the	Words”	(Los Angeles	CityBeat,	2005-08-11):</p>
<p class="calibre1">Only	once	in	my	life	have	I	seen	a	wonderful	medium	effectively	wiped	out by	new	technology.	Let	us	then	pay	homage	to	the	text	adventure	game,	a fascinating	form	that	flourished	so	briefly	that	it	only	lingers	on	in	the	minds	of fans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such	eulogies	are	all	too	often	interrupted	with	the	information	that	reports	of IF’s	death	were	greatly	exaggerated;	indeed,	the	good	news	of	the	existence	of an	Independent	era	often	inspires	these	nostalgic	features	in	the	first	place.	The cognitive	dissonance	in	mourning	the	dead	genre	reborn	is	very	much	in evidence	in	these	articles.	That	dissonance	is	in	part	an	artifact	of	Infocom’s status	in	our	capitalist	culture	as	both	icon	and	uncanny	ghost	of	an	early	games era.	Infocom	is	famed	for	a	spectacular	rise	and	fall	that	is	now	fundamentally associated	with	the	popularity	of	their	signature	genre	of	IF,	and	the unquestionable	fact	of	that	corporate	fall	literally	prevents	us	from	seeing	what comes	after.	Hence	the	whimsy	with	which	journalists	often	unveil	IF’s	current</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘lingering,’	framing	IF	practitioners	not	as	a	growing	community	of	avant-garde experimenters	but	as	a	dwindling	enclave	of	techno-Luddite	reactionaries	who have	stubbornly	refused	to	hear	that	The	Market	Has	Spoken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	truth	may	in	fact	lie	somewhere	in-between,	but	in	order	to	find	it	we must	first	understand	how	the	market	has	been	speaking,	and	what	significance this	has.	In	their	investigative	report	“Down	From	the	Top	of	Its	Game:	The</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>Story	of	Infocom,	Inc.”	(2000),	Hector	Briceno	 <i class="calibre3">et	al. </i>	argue	convincingly	that Infocom	was	destroyed,	not	by	a	sharp	downturn	in	their	games	sales,	but	by gambling	everything	and	losing	on	marketing	a	failed	commercial	database application,	“Cornerstone.”	Crucially,	Infocom	not	only	used	their	vast	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">revenue	to	fund	the	development	of	Cornerstone,	but	also	cut	their	R&amp;D	budget for	IF	during	the	crucial	transition	period	of	the	emergence	of	graphics.	The observation	that	Infocom	was	bankrupted	by	business	software	opens	up	a	space for	us	to	imagine	alternate	histories	of	IF	commerce,	although	questioning	the myth	of	Infocom’s	end	only	begins	to	address	the	larger	history	of	de-commodified	IF.	As	the	Granades	note,	corporate	IF	did	experience	a	kind	of mass	extinction	event	from	1987-1993.	Still,	it	is	worth	noting	that	these	dates are	not	absolute.	The	Granade’s	account	is	focused	on	English-language products	in	the	U.	S.	market,	as	are	most	available	histories.	The	European market	appears	to	have	lagged	behind,	with	continuing	commercial	distributions of	IF	for	the	Spectrum	and	Commodore	64;	eventually	it	followed	suit	when Zenobi	stopped	publishing	around	1997.	Similar	accounts	may	hold	in	the	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">markets	other	than	English,	although	the	extent	to	which	they	were	truly established	in	the	first	place	also	varies.	Oral	histories	of	IF	in	French,	Italian, Spanish,	and	Russian	have	only	begun	to	be	assembled	by	SPAG	magazine	in the	past	year,	but	they	remain	tentative. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	more	recent	commercial	history	of	IF	has	not	yet	been	written.	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">corporate	commerce	has	been	largely	quiet	for	a	decade,	a	lull	which	is	an	eye-blink	in	the	history	of	media	but	an	eternity	in	the	history	of	digital	technology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet	the	actual	impact	of	this	lull	is	complex.	Activision	acquired	and	soon	closed Infocom,	but	has	periodically	re-released	various	editions	of	the	Infocom	catalog every	few	years	since,	creating	a	kind	of	liminal	space	for	IF	commercial availability	that	resembles	the	cycles	book	edition	reprinting.	In	this,	IF	has arguably	been	more	fortunate	than	the	vast	majority	of	console	and	platform games	(or	the	majority	of	books,	for	that	matter)	whose	continued	circulation soon	depends	on	aftermarket	auctions,	bargain	bins,	and	grey	market redistribution	by	‘abandonware’	networks.	Another	complication	is	that	there	are forms	of	commerce	other	than	studio-based	corporate	mass	marketing.	What	we have	seen	instead	is	a	series	of	tentative	moves	towards	smaller	publishing ventures.	In	1998,	Infocom	author	and	software	developer	Mike	Berlyn attempted	to	start	an	IF	publishing	house	called	Cascade	Mountain	Publishing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	brief	and	disorganized	venture	published	two	works	in	little	more	than	a year	before	shutting	down.	In	2002,	Howard	Sherman	founded	Malinche Entertainment,	an	IF	business	which	today	successfully	distributes	a	growing</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>catalog	of	Sherman’s	own	work.	As	a	single-author	distributor,	Malinche	does not	function	as	an	IF	publisher	except	in	the	narrowest	of	senses.

Malinche	periodically generates	headlines	on	IF	as	commercial	available	boxed	products,	as	well	as headlines	on	IF	use	with	the	latest	computational	devices	du	jour	�	PDAs,	the Nintendo	DS	personal	game	device,	the	Apple	iPhone	cellphone,	and	so	forth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Also	in	2002,	Peter	Nestad’s	Illuminated	Lantern	Publishing	began	to	distribute his	own	1893:	a	World’s	Fair	Mystery,	a	singularly	comprehensive	and historically	well-researched	multimedia	IF	that	has	done	a	brisk	business	since as	both	an	entertainment	and	an	educational	product.	In	contrast	to	Malinche, which	casts	itself	as	carrying	on	the	torch	of	the	Infocom	corporate	games	era, Illuminated	Press	has	instead	targeted	bookshops,	museums,	gift	shops,	and	so forth,	promoting	the	work	first	for	its	subject	matter	and	only	secondarily	for	its form.	In	2006,	David	Cornelson	announced	Westfield	Chandler	Publishing,	Inc., a	new	IF	publisher	whose	imprint	(“TextFyre”)	intends	to	market	original	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">works	to	children.	The	venture	is	currently	underway	with	three	titles	under development	by	different	authors,	but	its	results	remain	to	be	seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IF	commercial	entities	may	also	engage	in	noncommercial	activities.	On	the occasion	of	a	2007	exhibition	of	H.	P.	Lovecraft’s	work	in	Switzerland’s	Maison d’Ailleurs	(the	Museum	of	Science	Fiction,	Utopias,	and	Extraordinary Journeys),	Illuminated	Lantern	has	organized	a	collection	of	English,	French, and	Spanish	works	of	IF	all	inspired	by	Lovecraft’s	unpublished	notes.	The	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">works	that	make	up	the	H.	P.	Lovecraft	Commonplace	Book	Project	are	not	yet available	commercially,	however	they	on	exhibition	in	Switzerland	and distributed	freely	over	the	web	by	the	publisher.	Like	Malinche,	Illuminated Lantern	is	acting	here	as	a	kind	of	cultural	advocate	for	the	genre,	and	the exhibition	recalls	some	of	the	many	ways	in	which	the	public	practice	of	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">culture	can	be	organized	around	terms	other	than	direct	commerce.	The legitimacy	of	noncommercial	exhibition	also	raises	a	larger	and	more	important question	that	has	remained	unasked	by	the	extant	histories	to	date:	Why	are	all our	histories	of	IF	invariably	organized	around	commerce	rather	than	aesthetics? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Commerce	tells	us	much	about	how	IF	works	have	been	bought	and	sold,	while telling	us	little	or	nothing	about	what	IF	works	have	been	and	meant.	While	I share	Montfort’s	objections	to	Aarseth’s	evaluation	of	IF	as	“a	remarkable,	short-lived	genre”	(Aarseth	101),	I	must	simultaneously	note	that	Montfort	shares	with Aarseth	the	presumption	that	the	difference	between	“The	Commercial”	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Independents”	(that	is,	the	difference	between	IF	produced	with	the	intent to	sell	and	IF	produced	with	the	intent	to	distribute	freely)	is	a	fundamental</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>organizing	difference	for	describing	IF.	This	might	be	argued	to	be	the	case	for many	possible	reasons.	For	example,	aesthetic	shifts	might	have	been	tightly	tied to	the	changes	in	technologies	and	shifts	in	active	authors	that	occurred	as	a result	of	the	commercial-to-noncommercial	transition.	However,	no	critic	has	in fact	argued	that	works	of	IF	are	different	in	important	aesthetic	or	formal	ways that	logically	organize	them	into	groups	by	these	periods.	Instead,	critics	have simply	presumed	these	differences	in	association	with	the	given	commercial timeline,	while	speaking	in	general	terms	of	contemporary	‘innovations’	�	a	set of	explorations	into	‘shorter’	‘puzzle-less’	and	‘literary’	IF	which	rise	in prominence	during	recent	years	but	which	have	strong	precursors	in	earlier productions.	From	a	critical	and	aesthetic	standpoint,	exploring	formal	and thematic	continuities	may	be	more	helpful	to	us	than	a	tale	of	rupture	and disjunction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Existing	histories	of	IF	are	important,	but	insufficient	to	aid	us	in	coming	to grips	with	the	aesthetic	objects.	Before	building	on	them,	we	need	to	begin again,	and	more	broadly,	addressing	IF	not	just	as	an	assumed	form	or	as	an	ex-commodity,	but	as	a	contested	term	and	an	ambiguous	genre.	In	the	next	two sections	of	this	introduction	I’d	like	to	return	to	our	original	question,	“What	is IF?”,	dividing	it	this	time	by	a	new	distinction	into	two	questions	about	which there	is	substantial	confusion:	“What	has	‘interactive	fiction’	meant?”	and	“What has	IF	been?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	5.	Some	things	that	have	been	termed	“interactive	fiction”	(clockwise from	left):	Choose	Your	Own	Adventure	#1,	Zork	I,	Myst,	Dragon’s	Lair, Patchwork	Girl</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	has	‘interactive	fiction’	meant?”	is	a	question	of	cultural	etymology, concerned	primarily	with	how	the	signifier	‘interactive	fiction’	has	been	attached to	a	multitude	of	surprisingly	different	signified	objects	over	the	past	three decades	of	development	and	two	decades	of	scholarship.	The	question	is	also concerned	with	the	advent	of	hypothetical	future	objects	which	might	one	day	be labeled	“interactive	fiction”	but	do	not	as	yet	exist.	Many	of	these	object	groups have	been	forms	of	digital	avant-garde	art,	research	prototypes,	or	simply imaginings,	while	only	a	very	few	have	been	categories	of	commercial	goods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Uses	of	the	phrase	in	criticism	have	reflected	a	wide	range	of	a	priori	positions (that	is	to	say,	ideologies)	on	what	true	interactivity	is	and	is	not,	as	well	as	what it	can	and	cannot	become	with	regards	to	fiction,	narration,	literature,	and	text (not	to	mention	conversation,	drama,	game,	etc.).	The	phrase	“interactive</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>fiction”	opens	out	onto	a	whole	universe	of	media	forms,	including	IF	(e.g. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zork),	hypertext	fiction	(e.g.	Afternoon),	immersive	puzzle	games	(e.g.	Myst), cinematic	action	games	(e.g.	Dragon’s	Lair),	gamebooks	(e.g.	Choose	Your	Own Adventure),	and	much	more.	Tracing	out	the	scholarly	questions	and	assertions surrounding	this	phrase	illuminates	a	fascinating	history	of	confusion	and disjuncture	in	which	new	media	scholars	have	talked	past	each	other	by	using similar	words	to	mean	different	things.	In	particular,	the	use	of	“interactive fiction”	as	a	synonym	for	either	“electronic	literature”	or	“hypertext	fiction” </p>
<p class="calibre1">emerged	during	an	enthusiastic	era	of	hypertext	studies	from	the	mid-1980s	to the	mid-1990s	and	declined	thereafter.	Thus	in	1984	Niesz	and	Holland	turn from	sustained	consideration	of	command	line	interaction	to	contemplating	the immanent	internet	that	a	possible	future	of	massively	multi-author	texts	(126), while	Moulthrop	and	Kaplan	follow	in	1991	by	citing	this	“first	critical	appraisal of	interactive	fiction”	(45-46)	in	their	own	discussion	of	the	advent	of hypertextual	node-and-link	authoring	�	a	transition	Jerz	notes	in	his bibliography	appears	to	be	“comparing	apples	to	oranges.”	Perhaps	due	in	part	to this	recent	history	of	contestation	and	ambiguity,	disparate	new	media	scholars are	largely	in	agreement	today	in	dismissing	the	term	‘interactive’	is	far	too vague	to	be	critically	useful.	The	logics	of	these	dismissals	come	with	some caveats	and	will	be	scrutinized	in	a	section	that	follows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	has	IF	been?”	on	the	other	hand	is	a	question	of	genre,	concerned primarily	with	signifieds	and	attempting	to	delineate	a	group	of	similar	cultural objects	a	posteriori.	These	objects	are	called	by	the	familiar	acronym	“IF”	not	as an	articulation	of	theory,	but	rather	as	a	matter	of	record,	deferring	to	the predominant	use	of	the	label	by	the	creators	and	audiences	of	these	objects,	and the	historical	fact	of	subsequent	circulation	of	the	label	in	awards	ceremonies, newsletters,	manuals,	archives,	newsletters,	and	so	forth.	We	can	describe	such objects	formally	(as	was	done	above)	but	this	must	primarily	be	a	report	on existing	practices.	While	commercial	histories	may	ground	objects	of	study	in exchange	value,	cultural	studies	require	only	cultural	circulation,	in	which	a name	need	not	be	purchasable,	only	knowable.	This	is	not	to	say	that	the	naming of	genres	is	a	monolithic	practice.	Indeed,	the	objects	here	called	“IF”	have	gone by	many	names,	commonly	referred	to	as	“text	adventures”	and	“adventure games,”	and	less	commonly	referred	to	as	“compunovels”	“storygames” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“perspecta-stories”	and	“fantasy	simulation	games,”	each	reflecting	a	unique perspective	(that	is	to	say,	ideology)	on	the	total	work.	Importantly,	these	can	be associated	with	historical	periods.	Tracing	the	popular	uses	of	these	labels reveals	an	interesting	periodization,	with	the	explicit	“adventure	games” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>(referring	to	the	original	Adventure)	later	bifurcating	into	two	terms,	on	the	one hand	the	retronym	“text	adventure	games,”	signaling	the	growing	primacy	of graphical	software	termed	“adventure	games,”	and	on	the	other	hand	the neologism	“interactive	fiction,”	later	applied	to	many	other	media	forms	and genres.	In	addition	to	the	popular	history	of	labeling	IF,	there	is	also	a	critical history,	and	like	tracing	the	widespread	dismissal	of	the	phrase	“interactive fiction,”	tracing	out	the	scholarly	formulations	of	these	objects	(whatever	they are	called)	reveals	a	different	form	of	broad	consensus.	IF	works	are	often invoked	in	new	media	criticism	during	flare-ups	in	scholarly	debates (Hypertextual	Studies,	Games	Studies,	“Ludology	vs.	Narratology”	etc.)	as	an example	of	commonality	and	a	common	reference	point	across	categorical distinctions	of	story	/	game,	text	 <i class="calibre3">drama,	conversation	</i> simulation	and	so	forth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IF’s	given	role	is	as	the	irreducible	and	inassimilable	remainder	of	several competing	theoretical	frameworks	for	new	media	objects. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Genre	and	cultural	etymology	are	not	separable	areas	of	inquiry,	of	course. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	one	point	of	view,	the	study	of	IF	as	genre	could	be	taken	as	one	subset	of a	much	larger	debate	over	many	a	priori	concepts	of	“interactive	fiction”	with the	eventual	goal	of	fitting	IF	into	a	framework	or	typology	(e.g.	Aarseth’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘textonomy’).	From	the	complimentary	point	of	view,	such	questions	are	more properly	approached	as	the	subset,	subordinate	to	the	studies	of	actual	art objects.	Beginning	in	genre,	we	instead	ask,	“What	ideology	is	reflected	in	this community	adoption	of	this	term	to	describe	these	works?”	While	both	the discussion	of	the	conceptual	term	“interactive	fiction”	and	the	living	genre	“IF” </p>
<p class="calibre1">will	now	be	pursued	in	more	detail,	and	both	approaches	to	the	intersection	of cultural	etymology	and	genre	can	lead	into	interesting	discussions	of	systems and	practices,	this	study	overall	leans	towards	the	generic	rather	than	ideal formulation	as	it	progresses	in	chapters	from	generalities	into	close	readings	of actual	objects	of	art.	Indeed,	one	of	the	underlying	concerns	of	this	study	is	how the	process	of	“close	reading”	can	meaningfully	be	conducted	in	relation	to simulation	and	to	source	code.	This	is	a	very	interesting	problematic	for	new media	humanists,	and	one	whose	practices	can	only	be	worked	out	through specific	undertakings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	has	IF	been?	IF	as	genre</p>
<p class="calibre1">First,	a	framing	analogy:	Given	paper	as	a	‘medium,’	the	codex	as	a	‘media form,’	and	the	novel	as	a	‘genre,’	this	project	is	a	study	of	the	genre	historically called	“interactive	fiction,”	as	it	occurs	in	the	media	form	of	the	command	line</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>text	parser,	in	the	medium	of	the	stored	program	digital	computer.	Already	in this	simple	analogy	the	terms	‘media’	and	‘media	form’	are	straining	to accommodate	many	layers	of	hardware,	data,	virtual	machine,	software processes,	and	interface	into	an	implied	clean	bifurcation.	The	term	‘genre’</p>
<p class="calibre1">similarly	strains	towards	its	own	endless	bifurcations,	for	what	is	the Bildungsroman	but	a	sub-genre	of	the	genre	called	the	novel,	and	/	or	of	fiction, etc.?	Hopefully	this	analogy	has	still	conveyed	aesthetic	specificity	�</p>
<p class="calibre1">specificity,	but	not	formality.	Rather	than	a	naturally	occurring	partition	of	the arts,	‘genre’	here	signifies	Wittgenstein’s	concept	of	“family	resemblances,”	and as	such	a	genre	study	of	IF	is	a	negotiation	of	compound	observations	and	partial definitions	�	contingent	in	its	distinctions,	always	deferential	to	historical traditions	of	naming,	production,	and	reception,	and	yet	insistent	in	questioning how	relationships	of	materiality,	form,	aesthetics,	and	practice	are	at	the	heart	of the	genre’s	cultural	work	and	human	meaning.	It	is	central	to	this	approach	to question	precisely	those	qualities	of	IF	as	a	genre	that	are	not	evident	necessities of	media	form,	but	rather	might	(or	might	not)	grow	out	of	or	in	relation	to	that form.	Two	examples	of	such	questions	engaged	at	length	in	this	study: 1.	“Why	are	the	overwhelming	majority	of	IF	works	written	in	the	second person,	given	the	near	absence	of	sustained	second-person	in	almost	all	other genres	of	textual	art,	and	the	absence	of	technical	restrictions	necessitating	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	brief,	I	argue	that	a)	the	second-person	mode,	while	unstable,	is	highly effective	at	eliciting	immersion	in	a	textual	simulation,	similar	to	the	first-person camera,	and	yet	b)	this	aspect	of	IF	is	not	truly	technology-dependent,	but instead	best	understood	as	one	of	a	group	of	the	only	three	genres	in	which	use of	the	second-person	predominates:	gamebooks,	role	playing	games,	and	IF.	All of	are	tightly	related	in	origin	and	emerged	almost	simultaneously	in	the	~1966-1976	period	I	term	“the	rise	of	semiotic	simulation.”	While	connections	between each	pair	in	this	triumvirate	have	been	remarked,	taken	together	each	third represents	a	missing	link	in	understanding	the	other	two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2.	“Why	have	the	aesthetics	of	critically	acclaimed	IF	works	shifted	over	the past	two	decades	away	from	extroverted	adventures	(e.g.	fantasy	quest,	murder mystery,	pirate	voyage,	space	flight)	and	towards	introverted	tales	of	alienation (e.g.	amnesia,	interrogation,	hallucination,	kidnapping)?”	In	brief,	I	argue	that	a) this	shift	is	a	continuing	trend	rather	than	a	rupture,	as	emphasis	on	introversion and	alienation	was	present	from	the	earliest	works,	although	they	were	not generally	advertised	as	such	and	the	slide	from	talk	of	“adventure”	to	“fantasy” </p>
<p class="calibre1">further	obscured	it,	and	that	b)	current	trends	in	IF	authorship	represent	serious</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>artistic	exploration	of	a	problematic,	‘frustration,’	that,	like	the	specular	gaze	of the	camera	in	cinema,	presents	both	a	set	of	extreme	constraints	on	IF	artists	and the	opportunity	to	develop	a	set	of	unique	idioms,	although	c)	current	IF	themes and	styles	cannot	be	explained	purely	as	an	engagement	with	form,	as	they reflect	a	deep	relationship	between	the	writers	of	contemporary	independent	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	the	20th	century	novel,	in	particular	popular	generic	tropes	such	as	detective fiction	and	the	high	literary	generic	trope	Linda	Hutcheon	terms	“historiographic metafiction.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">These	questions	demonstrate	how	this	approach	to	IF	as	a	genre	differs	from how	it	has	normally	been	first	defined	and	then	engaged	as	a	media	form:	a technology	of	command	line,	text	parser,	and	object	model	often	seen	as synonymous	with	or	trivially	distinct	from	the	aesthetic	uses	of	that	technology, much	as	if	the	genre	of	“novel”	were	to	be	conflated	with	the	media	concept	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">“codex.”	This	widespread	emphasis	on	function	following	form	is	in	part	due	to the	trends	in	the	field,	and	in	part	due	to	the	real	absence	until	just	a	few	years ago	of	robust	historical	research	such	as	that	done	by	Jerz,	Montfort,	and	Maher. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	my	earlier	critique,	these	histories	provide	this	study	with	tall	shoulders on	which	to	stand	(albeit	carefully)	when	moving	from	a	retelling	of	what	to towards	an	engagement	with	why	and	how.	If	other	criticism	has	largely neglected	the	genre	as	a	whole,	and	instead	turned	again	and	again	to	the exceptionally	well-understood	and	well-documented	history	of	the	1970s	text parser,	this	is	understandable.	Understandable,	but	lamentable	and	still	worth belaboring:	it	is	as	if	we	had	a	body	of	criticism	on	the	novel	with	most	articles retelling	the	story	of	Cervantes	writing	Don	Quixote	before	moving	to	discuss aspects	of	page	numbering,	chaptering,	and	tables	of	contents	in	“Quixote-like works,”	with	scant	attention	to	themes,	modes	of	characterization,	exposition, narration,	plot,  <i class="calibre3">etc. </i>	Just	as	the	novel	is	neither	simply	a	codex	nor	a	set	of variations	on	Don	Quixote,	but	instead	grows	out	of	and	in	intimate	relation	to the	codex	form,	so	too	the	IF	genre	is	neither	simply	the	command	line	text parser	nor	a	set	of	variations	on	Adventure.	Making	this	distinction	allows	us	to question	how	IF	has	developed	out	of	and	in	relation	to	the	command	line	form it	is	so	often	conflated	with,	as	well	as	interrogate	the	generic	features	that	at first	seem	superfluous	to	that	form,	asking	“Why	the	imperative	tense?”	“Why spatial	rather	than	temporal	or	topical	agency?”	and	so	forth.	These	questions may	lead	us	(as	they	often	have	in	the	criticism	of	print	fiction)	to	consider	not only	ur-texts,	but	also	precisely	those	exceptional	experimental	works	that	are celebrated	for	their	violations	of	conventions.	So,	for	example,	in	the	IF	works	of Andrew	Plotkin,	Hunter	in	Darkness	(1999)	removes	visual	representation, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>Spider	and	Web	(1998)	removes	continuous	chronology,	The	Space	Under	the Window	(1997)	removes	spatial	navigation,	and	So	Far	(1996)	removes	material realism,	each	implicitly	asking	“is	this	still	IF?”	By	exploring	these	border	cases</p>
<p class="calibre1">�	from	Sam	Barlow’s	non-sequential	Aisle	(1999)	to	Emily	Short’s conversational	Galatea	(2000)	�	we	simultaneously	highlight	the	limits	of	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	discover	the	deeper	continuities	between	IF	and	related	novels,	films,	video game,	hypertexts	and	so	forth.	Importantly,	the	vast	majority	of	these	‘border case’	works	have	all	been	written	during	the	critical	lacuna	of	the	past	decade, with	scholarly	attention	limited	to	discussions	scattered	amidst	the	historical summaries	of	that	period	mentioned	earlier	�	“The	Independents”	in	Nick Montfort’s	Twisty	Little	Passages	(2003)	and	both	“The	Growth	of	Hobbyist	IF” </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	“The	Evolution	of	a	Community”	in	Jimmy	Maher’s	thesis	“Let’s	Tell	a Story	Together”	(2006).	These	histories	reveal	how	scholars	have	been	trapped in	an	origin	myth	of	IF	�	a	myth	that	reassures	us	we	already	know	what	IF	is, and	need	only	demonstrate	it.	Meanwhile,	the	growing	prevalence	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">“experimental”	work	hints	at	an	ongoing	shift	in	the	conception	of	what	writing IF	entails. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	genre	approach	is	not	counter	to,	but	rather	builds	upon	fundamental engagement	with	the	media	forms	that	are	the	strata	of	aesthetic	experiences,	just as	asking,	“What	is	a	codex?	What	is	paper?	What	does	it	do?”	might	provoke	a deeper	engagement	with	James	Joyce’s	Finnegans	Wake	or	Mark	Danielewski’s House	of	Leaves.	Working	in	the	fraught	and	shifting	terrain	of	new	media	arts criticism	today	in	fact	presumes	such	provocations,	and	one	of	the	great opportunities	of	our	present	critical	moment	is	the	constant	defamiliarization	that computational	media	enact	on	our	perceptions,	encouraging	us	always	to	see everything	anew.	In	“Print	Is	Flat,	Code	Is	Deep”	(2004),	N.	Katherine	Hayles frames	this	situation	as	a	great	awakening:	“Lulled	into	somnolence	by	five hundred	years	of	print,	literary	studies	have	been	slow	to	wake	up	to	the importance	of	media-specific	analysis”	(20). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet	the	welcome	revivals	of	materialism	and	structuralism	in	contemporary new	media	criticism	and	games	studies	have	brought,	along	with	their	rigors	and rewards,	a	danger	of	losing	the	object	of	study,	whether	that	object	be	a	chatbot or	a	hypertext,	a	video	installation	or	a	video	game.	Browsing	through	stacks	of critical	monographs,	piles	of	papers,	and	a	hard	drive	of	files,	I	am	struck	by	the infrequency	with	which	I	encounter	close	readings	�	or	rather,	close interactions	�	in	relation	to	these	objects:	a	rarity	of	extended	critical engagements	with	not	only	the	form	but	also	the	texture	of	IF	works	as	they</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>unfold	for	us	in	all	their	aesthetic	particularity.	Perhaps	this	lack	is	a	mere byproduct	of	our	shifting	focus	away	from	what	things	mean	and	towards	a renewed	attention	to	what	they	do.	At	times,	however,	I	fear	that	a	deeper prejudice	may	be	at	work	in	our	critical	community,	leading	scholars	to	focus	too often	on	the	how	of	new	media	at	the	expense	of	the	what,	and	in	so	doing dismiss	with	perfunctory	summary	the	passions	of	artists	and	the	experiences	of their	audiences,	precisely	as	if	the	work	warranted	(and	indeed,	could	bear)	no deeper	scrutiny.	I	fear	the	mistake,	in	other	words,	of	assuming	that	the	enduring importance	of	new	media	objects	resides	always	in	the	ways	that	they	are	new, but	never	in	their	particular	artistic	renewals	of	our	continual	engagements	with lived	experience.	The	great	disappointment	of	new	media	criticism	in	the humanities	is	that	much	of	it	is	surprisingly	inhumane. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such	a	critique,	invoking	genre,	close	reading,	and	the	human	uses	of	human art,	might	easily	be	labeled	contrarian,	if	not	reactionary,	and	it	is	not	an overstatement	to	describe	this	approach	as	a	calculated	risk.	Risk,	because	this study’s	modest	focus	on	so	specific	a	subject	as	the	IF	genre	may	seem considerably	less	grand	(and	less	widely	useful)	than	the	broad	structural	and formal	theories	of	hypertext,	games,	and	computation	that	have	in	large	part been	the	lifeblood	of	recent	new	media	arts	criticism.	Calculated,	however, because	the	works	in	this	study	do	reward	sustained	engagement,	and	here	they are	thus	engaged:	an	uncanny	late	night	preceding	a	desert	rave,	the	rich rendering	of	a	single	moment	in	a	grocery	store,	the	relentless	replay	of	a	single-car	accident	at	a	crowded	pool	hall,	and	more.	One	reward	of	this	approach	is rich	comparative	study.	Rematch	for	example	suggests	comparative	study	of	the event	of	the	car	crash	as	it	plays	out	across	disparate	works,	say	as	compared	to the	car	crash	at	the	heart	of	Michael	Joyce’s	preeminent	hypertext	fiction Afternoon,	and	in	the	context	of	the	car	crashes	that	often	appear	in	variable-timeline	themed	films	such	as	Run	Lola	Run,	Donnie	Darko,	The	Butterfly Effect,	It’s	a	Wonderful	Life,	and	Groundhog	Day	(to	name	just	a	few).	If	we subsequently	find	that	car	crashes	signify	not	just	mortality	but	specific	attitudes towards	moments	of	crucial	choice,	then	reading	Rematch	and	Afternoon together	is	not	only	mutually	illuminating,	but	reflects	some	light	back	on	how such	choices	tend	to	be	represented	or	may	be	represented	differently	in	works	of IF	and	hypertext. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Out	of	such	engagements	arise	compelling	new	theories	of	digital	text, theories	aspiring	to	broad	appropriation	and	reuse.	Thus	this	work	forwards	a theory	for	computational	reading	and	interaction	practices	as	“implied	code,”	a</p>

<p class="calibre1">What	has	‘interactive	fiction’	meant?	Interactivity	and	narrative The	term	interactivity	is	overused	and	underunderstood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">�	Chris	Crawford,	The	Art	of	Interactive	Design</p>
<p class="calibre1">Having	introduced	the	need	for	and	potential	of	a	genre	approach	to	IF,	up	to the	closest	reading,	we	now	turn	outward,	to	the	question	of	the	cultural etymology	of	the	phrase	“interactive	fiction”	as	it	extends	to	almost	infinite space.	By	now	it	is	hopefully	apparent	that	“interactive	fiction,”	as	used	in	this study	in	the	familiar	‘IF,’	cannot	be	an	abstract	category	of	fiction	that	somehow lays	theoretical	claim	to	an	authentic	or	privileged	‘interactivity.’	Rather,	it	is	a historic	designator	of	a	set	of	art	objects	with	deep	family	resemblances,	and	as	a designator	it	is	as	arbitrary	in	its	way	as	the	association	of	the	signifier	‘pipe’</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	its	signified,	and	as	anachronistic	and	specious	in	its	way	as	the	claim	of new	media	to	be	new,	of	modernism	to	be	modern,	or	even	of	the	16th	century Italian	‘novella’	to	be,	as	we	might	translate	it	into	English,	a	‘little	novelty,’	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘novel.’	All	such	terms	can	seem	irritatingly	vapid	in	the	cold	light	of	a	decade or	two,	but	the	irritation	fades,	until	after	a	mere	century	the	terms	may	appear	to be	wholly	natural.	While	the	terms	‘interactive’	and	‘fiction’	when	combined	to make	up	IF	are	arguably	more	misleading	(if	not	more	contentious)	than	other anachronisms	like	‘novel,’	similar	considerations	apply:	while	critics	might easily	choose	another	term	to	substitute	for	‘novel’	(and,	indeed,	some	have	done so)	most	are	dissuaded	from	this	clean	break	with	tradition	by	the	inconvenient activities	of	authors,	who	continue	to	write	works	that	they	call	‘novels’	and furthermore	stubbornly	insist	on	circulating	those	works	in	culture	named	as such.	This	same	situation	applies	to	the	thousands	of	extra-canonical	new	media works	cataloged	and	available	for	public	download	at	Baf’s	Guide	to	the Interactive	Fiction	Archive,	f�ted	at	awards	ceremonies,	and	discussed	on	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">newsletters,	IF	discussion	boards,	and	so	on	and	so	forth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	danger	of	this	kind	of	theoretical	realpolitik	that	embraces	common	usage is	that	it	may	run	the	risk	of	uncritically	assimilating	the	assumptions	present	in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>the	genre’s	self-representation.	Such	assimilation	could	perhaps	be	avoided	by	a substitution	that	replaces	“IF”	with	either	an	existing	alternative	such	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">“storygames”	or	perhaps	yet	another	neologism:	I	might	propose	“simulator-parsers.”	Of	course,	these	labels	come	with	their	own	ideological	freighting,	not least	the	ones	that	sound	the	most	technologically	dispassionate.	Instead,	perhaps we	should	confront	head-on	the	ideology	inherent	in	the	current	terms	we	see	in predominant	circulation.	New	media	critics	have	tended	to	deal	with	“interactive fiction”	either	as	a	category	(interchangeable	with	“interactive	narrative”	and other	evocative	statements)	or	as	a	symptom	of	critical	frustrations	within	the realm	of	new	media	criticism,	rather	than	from	a	vantage	of	cultural	critique	that asks	what	the	phrase	meant	to	its	users	and	promulgators	and	what	cultural	work that	use	did.	We	can	begin	by	tracing	the	existing	critiques	of	‘interactive,’</p>
<p class="calibre1">considering	how	they	have	addressed	or	bypassed	the	genre	of	IF	before considering	how	we	can	build	on	them	and	move	beyond	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	theories	of	computer-based	narratives	the	term	‘interactive’	has	been	so richly	evocative	and	so	widely	circulated	in	the	past	two	decades	that	it	is	in perpetual	peril	of	becoming	evacuated	of	all	meaning.	Researchers	in	new	media and	electronic	literature	are	continually	tempted	to	set	the	term	aside	once	and for	all,	and	this	temptation	has	arrived	with	such	constant	consistency	for	the	last decade	at	least	that	a	statement	repudiating	‘interactivity’	for	its	vagueness	has become	a	great	commonality	and	even	a	vogue	in	the	otherwise	disparate	work of	critics	confronting	the	issues	of	computational	narratives.	Before	embarking on	a	new	exploration	of	the	problematic	relationship	between	computational interactivity	and	narrative,	let	us	begin	first	by	attempting	to	understand	the recent	vexed	history	of	the	‘underunderstood’	term	interactivity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consider	two	opposing	but	complimentary	examples	drawn	from	the	titles	and bodies	of	recent,	prominent	new	media	monographs:	In	the	introduction	to	The Art	of	Interactive	Design	(2003),	Chris	Crawford	dismisses	‘interactivity’	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">“one	of	the	buzzterms	of	the	times”	(2)	applied	to	everything	from	computers	to shampoo,	before	defining	it	concisely	as	“a	conversation”	and	detailing	a dialogic	theory	of	interactivity.	Similarly,	in	Pause	and	Effect:	the	Art	of Interactive	Narrative	(2002),	Mark	Meadows	opens	his	discussion	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘interaction’	by	deploring	how	“catchwords	abound”	in	its	definition	(37)	before moving	to	craft	a	quite	different	theory	from	Crawford	�	a	‘perspective’	theory grounded	in	the	history	of	western	visual	arts.	When	Meadows	describes interactive	narrative	as	“a	time-based	representation	of	character	and	action	in which	a	reader	can	affect,	choose,	or	change	the	plot”	(62),	the	parting	of	ways</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>from	Crawford’s	“conversation”	is	profound.	For	Crawford,	there	are	degrees	of interactivity,	but	true	interactive	storytelling	is	nascent,	and	will	remain unrealized	until	character	and	plot	have	been	abstracted	into	the	conversational physics	that	will	one	day	become	generative	drama.	For	Meadows,	interactive narrative	is	here	and	now,	with	rich	examples	of	plot	branches	negotiated	by readers	seeking	new	perspectives,	abounding	in	a	myriad	of	digital	genres.	Yet	if Meadows’s	perspectival	computer	narratives	and	Crawford’s	conversational computer	storytelling	seem	only	occasionally	and	orthogonally	to	describe	the same	subjects,	both	theoretical	approaches	to	computer	narration	share	a	point	of departure	in	the	need	to	escape	the	tyranny	of	their	primary	term	‘interactive’</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	some	substitution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such	acts	of	substitution	have	a	precedent	in	Janet	Murray’s	influential Hamlet	on	the	Holodeck:	the	Future	of	Narrative	in	Cyberspace	(1997).	In	it, Murray	defines	the	digital	environments	in	which	the	narratives	she	terms</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘cyberdrama’	will	occur	as	“procedural,	participatory,	spatial,	and	encyclopedic,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">before	volunteering	her	own	terms	as	a	substitution:	“the	first	two	properties make	up	most	of	what	we	mean	by	the	vaguely	used	word	interactive”	(71).	For Murray,	the	vagueness	of	‘interactivity’	is	pernicious,	as	it	spreads	deeper	critical confusions	in	its	wake:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because	of	the	vague	and	pervasive	use	of	the	term	interactivity,	the	pleasure of	agency	in	electronic	environments	is	often	confused	with	the	mere	ability	to move	a	joystick	or	click	on	a	mouse.	But	activity	alone	is	not	agency.	[…]	Some games,	like	chess,	can	have	relatively	few	or	infrequent	actions	but	a	high	degree of	agency.	(128)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	problem	identified	by	Murray	is	not	merely	how	interactivity	is	hyped, nor	indeed	how	it	has	been	misapplied	to	trivial	objects	such	as	shampoo,	but instead	how	the	term	has	become	generic,	appropriate	to	any	electronic environment	and	thus	a	synonym	for	all	the	amorphous	virtues	of	computation, making	rigorous	definition	of	real	human-computer	relationships	more	difficult for	responsible	scholars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	The	Language	of	New	Media	(2001),	Lev	Manovich	appears	to	concur, although	his	approach	is	first	to	codify	the	problem	as	a	stereotypical objectionable	claim	regarding	the	special	difference	of	new	media,	a	claim	he terms	“the	myth	of	interactivity.”	He	summarizes	that	myth	as	follows:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>New	media	is	interactive.	In	contrast	to	old	media	where	the	order	of presentation	is	fixed,	the	user	can	now	interact	with	a	media	object.	In	the process	of	interaction	the	user	can	choose	which	elements	to	display	or	which paths	to	follow,	this	generating	a	unique	work.	In	this	way	the	user	becomes	the coauthor	of	the	work.	(55)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manovich’s	primary	objection	to	use	of	the	term	interactivity	is	now	familiar:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	find	the	concept	too	broad	to	be	truly	useful.”	His	subsequent	critique, however,	is	substantive.	First,	computer-based	definitions	of	interactivity	are	a tautology,	as	all	modern	HCI	(human-computer	interaction)	is	interactive	by definition.	Second,	due	to	the	inherent	complexity	of	perceptual	processes	and cognition,	experience-based	definitions	of	interactivity	do	not	provide	useful distinctions	between	new	media	artworks	and	the	history	of	other	artworks	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">“orchestrate	the	viewer’s	attention”	including	examples	in	theatre,	painting,	film, and	so	forth.	Third,	applying	the	label	“interactive	media”	solely	to	computer-based	media	lures	both	media	studies	scholars	and	psychologists	into substituting	a	material	metaphor	for	the	actual	mental	processes	that	should	be studied,	and	encourages	the	fallacy	that	the	structure	of	any	new	medium	is isomorphic	to	the	mind	�	a	fallacy	repeated	since	the	19th	century	by	Galton, M�nsterberg,	Eisenstein,	Lanier,	and	others.	Yet	if	Manovich	faults	interactivity for	seducing	scholars	into	a	repeatedly	discredited	history	of	criticism,	it	is	worth noting	that	he	also	respects	the	unique	critical	challenge	interactivity	represents, declaring	that	“to	deal	theoretically	with	users’	experiences	of	(interactive) structures…	remains	one	of	the	most	difficult	theoretical	questions	raised	by	new media”	(56). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	final	word	on	rejecting	interactivity	is	reserved	here	for	Espen	Aarseth’s Cybertext:	Perspectives	on	Ergodic	Literature	(1997),	from	a	strident	passage	in which	he	damns	interactivity	utterly	as	“commercial	rhetoric…	accepted uncritically	by	academics	with	little	concern	for	precise	definitions	or	implicit ideologies”	(48).	As	in	Murray’s	contemporaneous	book,	and	as	Manovich	does later,	Aarseth	identifies	the	term	‘interactivity’	as	an	artifact	of	early	computing culture,	signifying	nothing	more	specific	than	any	user-input	enabled	computer, and,	with	user-input	being	the	de	facto	standard	ever	since	the	decline	of	the earliest	batch	processing	machines,	that	means	any	computer.	Aarseth	sees	this empty	signification	of	‘interactive’	as	enabling	broader	excesses	of	marketing language	“such	as	interactive	newspapers…	and	even	interactive	houses”	(48), an	objection	later	echoed	by	both	Meadows	and	Crawford	in	their	complaints about	catchwords	and	shampoo.	Aarseth,	however,	goes	further	than	either	in	his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>complaints,	naming-and-shaming	a	rogue’s	gallery	of	vague	critics,	with	special attention	paid	to	the	hypertext	scholars	whose	appropriation	of	the	term	he	views as	transparently	ideological.	He	also	goes	deeper	in	providing	a	partial	but	useful cultural	etymology	of	the	phrase	“interactive	fiction,”	from	its	commercial coining	by	Scott	Adams’s	software	company	Adventure	International,	through its	appearance	in	Bob	Liddil’s	1981	Byte	magazine	article	“Interactive	Fiction: Six	Micro	Stories,”	and	up	to	the	first	literary	critical	use	in	the	title	of	Anthony Niesz	and	Norman	Holland’s	1984	article	“Interactive	Fiction.”	While	Aarseth holds	these	forbears	responsible	for	the	term’s	incorporation	into	1990s	theories of	hypertext,	how	this	came	to	pass	is	left	as	an	exercise	to	his	readers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	survey	has	thus	far	retraced	a	broad	consensus	on	the	recent	critique	of interactivity	by	new	media	and	electronic	literature	scholars,	and	it	ends	here,	in Aarseth’s	origin	tale,	a	particular	series	of	important	firsts	(first	commercial slogan,	first	industry	publication,	first	critical	essay)	that	together	attempt	to locate	a	crucial	moment	of	transfer	when	the	marketing	of	software	became conflated	with	its	theorization.	Yet	this	does	not	prove	that	the	market	has	either cheapened	or	obscured	the	art,	but	rather	suggests	that	criticism	has	itself	been overwhelmed	by	the	specter	of	commerce.	Indeed,	we	should	be	cautious	of	an overly	simplistic	tale	of	low	‘industry’	terminology	and	its	inappropriate appropriation	into	high	‘critical’	discourse,	as	it	elides	the	cultural	zeitgeist through	which	the	phrase	“interactive	fiction”	crossed	over	from	marketing language	into	critical	theory	�	if	in	fact	it	ever	truly	did	so.	Not	only	has	a terminological	approach	failed	to	reflect	the	historical	conditions	under	which objects	called	“interactive	fiction”	circulated	in	culture,	the	tale	of	linguistic misappropriation	as	detailed	by	Aarseth	(and	as	at	least	suggested	by	every	other critic	cited	in	this	section	thus	far)	may	lead	us	into	a	number	of	errors	in	our understanding	of	what	it	meant	and	means	for	fiction	to	be	interactive.	First,	the tale	fails	to	convey	what	kind	of	cultural	discourse	“Interactive	Fiction”	was	in 1984	�	not	obscure	industry	jargon,	but	rather	a	bestselling	mass-market phenomenon,	a	phrase	not	merely	handed	down	to	but	also	in	part	owned	by	the popular	culture	that	popularized	it	over	many	alternatives.	Second,	the	tale obscures	the	relationship	between	the	production	of	cultural	objects	termed</p>
<p class="calibre1">“interactive	fiction”	and	the	operations	of	the	academy,	implying	a	separation between	academia	and	industry	when	in	fact	the	major	distributors	and marketers	were	academics,	working	first	from	within	academia	and	then	later	in close	concert	with	it.	Third,	the	tale	moves	too	quickly	to	dismiss	the significance	of	marketing	rhetoric	categorically	as	useless	in	the	quest	for	formal rigor,	and	in	this	dismissal	it	glosses	over	the	importance	of	the	nature	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>marketing	rhetoric	that	was	widely	circulating	during	this	crucial	time	�	in particular,	the	fact	of	the	rhetoric’s	unexpected	coherence	and	verbose specificity.	Finally,	the	tale	invites	us	to	discard	as	incidental	the	real	and historically	identifiable	practice	of	doing	interactive	fiction	�	for	if	‘interacting’</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	an	empty	term,	the	widespread	practices	of	creating	and	engaging	with	these objects	remain	quite	real,	whatever	we	call	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This,	then,	is	a	point	of	intervention:	taking	IF,	this	one	genre	of	“interactive fiction”	at	the	crossroads	of	interactive	narrative’s	contestation,	and	trace	its practices	and	theories	forward	to	the	present,	not	because	it	is	clear,	rigorous, and	separate,	but	precisely	because	it	is	unclear,	contingent,	and	entangled	with other	registers	and	modes	of	textual	and	narrative	art.	But	first,	a	final	word	on the	quest	for	a	formal	definition	(or	renunciation)	of	‘interactivity.’	Searching	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">“curiously	few”	formal	definitions	of	interactivity,	Aarseth	finds	two:	Peter B�gh	Anderson’s	semiotic	definition	in	which	“the	reader	can	physically change	the	discourse	in	a	way	that	is	interpretable	and	produces	meaning	within the	discourse	itself”	(49)	and	Andrew	Lippman’s	interpersonal	definition	in which	“mutual	and	simultaneous	activity	on	the	part	of	both	participants” </p>
<p class="calibre1">implies	an	artificially	intelligent	interlocutor.	Aarseth	objects	that	Anderson’s definition	might	be	better	termed	“participation”	and	that	Lippman’s	A.I. </p>
<p class="calibre1">interlocutor	does	not	yet	exist,	disqualifying	any	current	computational	narrative from	being	truly	‘interactive.’	This	returns	us	to	Meadows	and	Crawford,	where we	began.	In	their	similar	parting	of	ways	over	a	decade	after	Anderson	and Lippman’s	work,	I	would	suggest	that	we	can	perceive	in	Meadows	and Crawford	the	figure	of	a	recurring	formation	that	divides	approaches	to interaction.	On	the	one	hand	Meadows’s	work	on	interactive	narrative	reflects	a permissive	focus	on	many	current	forms	of	reader	choice	and	agency.	On	the other	hand	Crawford’s	work	on	interactive	storytelling	reflects	a	rigorous demand	for	some	future	sophisticated	system	(although	Crawford	differs	from Lippman	in	focusing	not	on	character	simulation	but	storyworld	simulation).	Just as	both	works	struggle	with,	but	ultimately	succumb	to	their	titular	term interactive,	both	conceptions	struggle,	not	in	outlining	interesting	approaches	to narration,	but	in	forging	a	necessary	connection	between	those	approaches	and the	field	of	computational	media.	Perspective,	fine,	conversation,	fine,	but	what makes	this	particular	to	the	stored	program	digital	computer?	On	the	knife’s	edge of	media-specificity,	the	Anderson	and	Meadows	paradigms	of	choices	and perspectives	topples	the	way	of	pre-computational	media,	where	they	can	be easily	deconstructed	back	to	a	generalized	hermeneutics	of	participation	and perception	that	describes	most	art.	Lippman	and	Crawford’s	paradigms	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>conversation	topples	the	other	way,	into	a	post-computational	realm	of	behaviors that	our	computers	might	one	day	exhibit,	but	which	for	now	are	most	clearly recognizable	in	the	improvisational	actor	or	roleplaying	game-master	�	that	is to	say,	in	the	figure	of	the	human	being. </p>

This,	I	think	most people	would	agree,	would	also	not	be	IF	in	the	form	that	we	understand	it.	�</p>
<p class="calibre1">Emily	Short,	What’s	IF? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus	far	we	have	developed	the	silhouette	of	what	IF	is	in	a	number	of	ways, and	this	last	exploration	has	brought	a	number	of	problems	into	sharper	focus.	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">claims	at	least	superficially	to	be	“interactive	fiction,”	which	is	to	say	some	form of	computational	narration.	Yet	formulations	of	computational	narration	are heavily	contested	due	to	difficulties	in	outlining	a	form	of	narration	that	is	both exclusive	to	computation	and	sufficient	in	its	narrative	result.	Hypertextualists and	gamebookers	tend	to	find	opposing	formulations	either	insufficiently narrative	or	too	rigorous	to	be	fulfilled;	while	A.I.	researchers,	conversationalists and	dramaturges	tend	to	find	opposing	formulations	non-exclusive	to computational	media	or	too	general	to	be	convincing.	Where	IF	falls,	I	will argue,	is	in	the	middle	�	which	is	to	say	that	it	fails	at	both	in	quite	interesting ways.	But	to	prepare	for	larger	arguments	that	IF	itself	is	defined	by	what	it	is not	(that	is,	that	it	cannot	fulfill	claims	made	in	its	name	by	strong-AI	or	strong-plot	theories),	I’d	like	to	discuss	what	IF	manifestly	is	not	�	all	those exceptions	so	important	to	exclude	from	this	study	that	they	must	be	included. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>Representations	of	the	Command	Line IF	is	not	a	painting	or	photograph	containing	a	command	line	prompt,	nor	is	it a	book	describing	a	command	line	prompt,	whether	by	William	Gibson	in Neuromancer	or	Neil	Stephenson	in	Cryptonomicon,	nor	is	it	a	movie	scene replaying	a	command	line	interaction,	whether	it	be	Neo	first	encountering Trinity	via	his	terminal	in	the	film	The	Matrix	(1999)	or	the	man	/	child	Josh Baskin	playing	a	hybrid	text	adventure	game	in	the	film	Big	(1988)	�	although such	scenes	may	tell	us	much	about	our	cultural	preconceptions.	While	it	may seem	obvious	that	IF	is	not	a	scene	of	actor	Tom	Hanks	playing	at	Josh	Baskin playing,	this	also	suggests	that	IF	is	not	a	videotape	of	the	hour-long	session	of IF	that	you	yourself	may	have	explored,	nor	the	map	you	drew	to	aid	your explorations.	Neither	is	IF	the	complete	printed	transcript	of	your	session. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Artifacts	such	as	walkthrough	recordings	(of	the	command	stream)	and transcripts	(of	the	entire	text	stream)	circulate	widely	in	IF	culture,	and	are important	to	it,	but	the	transcripts	are	not	themselves	works	of	IF,	which	always imply	procedural	and	experiential	elements	that	cannot	be	flattened.	Hypertext studies	critics	and	games	studies	critics	are	at	this	point	nodding	their	heads	at this	familiar	purist	position	on	interactive	artifacts.	A	thornier	question,	however, is	“specifically	which	parts	of	the	total	work	of	IF	are	missing	when	we	read	a transcript?”	As	I	hope	my	model	of	‘implied	code’	will	demonstrate,	simply answering	“the	software”	is	specious,	as	the	structure	of	the	software	manifests itself	in	tangible	ways	through	a	transcript,	enabling	readers	(who	are	not,	at	that moment,	interactors)	to	form	complex	hypotheses	about	the	software’s	form	and function	�	although	not,	crucially,	to	test	hypotheses	beyond	the	limits	of	the transcript.	This	is	an	interesting	continuity	and	distinction,	and	has	implications for	theories	of	how	we	read	text	generator	artworks	and	software	in	general. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Historically,	we	have	seen	the	experience	of	IF	continuously	extend	beyond	the interface	in	two	ways.	First,	early	interactors	who	logged	in	to	IF	works	such	as Adventure	using	line	printers	(rather	than	screens)	would	study	their	printed transcripts	after	their	session	in	order	to	plan	future	interactions.	Second, communal	interaction	was	common	(and	perhaps	even	typical)	in	the	early	era, with	two	or	more	participants	gathered	together	around	the	interface	to	discuss the	session	and	suggest	possibilities	as	it	unfolded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	her	article	“Player	Created	Tiers	in	Alternate	Reality	Games,”	Christy	Dena formulates	a	‘tiering’	approach	to	explicate	how	Alternate	Reality	Games (ARGs)	may	come	to	be	experienced	partially	or	entirely	through	player-created</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>content	rather	than	content	originating	from	the	primary	producers.	Such	a theoretical	approach	challenges	any	attempted	essentialism	about	IF.

In	ARGs,	this larger	readership	encounters	the	effects	of	interactive	experience	second-hand, and	it	may	be	so	with	IF	as	well.	Still,	for	the	purposes	of	this	study,	we	will primarily	investigate	IF	as	direct	experience,	even	if	the	mode	of	investigation	is itself	paradoxically	indirect. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>Chat	clients</p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps	it	should	also	go	without	saying	that	a	chat	client,	or	software designed	to	pass	instant	messages,	is	not	a	work	of	IF.	Still,	many	of	the components	are	present,	including	the	command	line	prompt,	the	give	and	take of	language	exchange,	and	a	transcript.	Many	components	are	absent,	however, the	most	important	these	being	software	that	parses	the	interactor’s	text	and responds.	As	outlined	earlier	with	regards	to	speech	act	theory,	IF	resembles	an asymmetrical	engagement	with	a	formal	system	more	than	a	conversation.	A chat	client	is	not	in	itself	a	work	of	IF,	yet	it	can	become	part	of	such	a	work	if its	command	line	is	pointed	towards	an	interlocutor	that	behaves	in	a	certain	way</p>
<p class="calibre1">�	and	some	chatbots	actually	enable	exactly	this	kind	of	activity.	The relationship	of	the	chat	client	to	IF	is	not	a	superficial	resemblance.	Instead	this resemblance	goes	right	to	the	heart	of	what	we	might	call	the	more	existential questions	about	the	IF	genre	and	its	relationship	to	both	artificial	intelligence	and roleplaying,	that	is,	the	machine	and	the	human.	Consider:	an	interactor	engages two	interlocutors	using	a	chat	client.	One	is	a	talented	roleplayer	and	storyteller, who	has	been	instructed	to	use	the	conventions	of	IF	in	a	story	in	as	rigorous	a way	as	possible.	The	other	is	a	chatbot	running	a	sophisticated	piece	of	IF</p>

<p class="calibre1">If	the	interactor	can’t	tell	the	difference,	should	we	then	define	IF	as	an experience	rather	than	a	digital	artifact?	More	importantly,	who	in	this	scenario is	trying	to	pass	as	what? </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>Chatbots</p>
<p class="calibre1">IF	is	not	a	chatbot,	whether	Joseph	Weizenbaum’s	ELIZA	(1966)	or	Richard Wallace’s	A.L.I.C.E.	�	Artificial	Linguistic	Internet	Computer	Entity	(1995-present).	Most	chatbots,	while	they	are	both	command	line	based	and	software systems,	are	formally	different	from	IF	in	crucial	ways.	Chatbot	software generally	lacks	an	object	tree	or	world	model,	and	thus	has	difficulty	in	making responses	based	on	the	past	information	(e.g.	“What	number	did	I	ask	you	to remember?”).	Rather	than	enabling	the	user	to	act	on	the	stored	states	in	world (or	conversation)	model,	with	subsequent	dynamics	of	spatial	exploration	or interrogation,	chatbots	instead	attempt	to	simulate	a	topical	conversation,	and	in this	endeavor	chatbots	are	generally	programmed	with	strategies	of	permissive pattern	matching	rather	than	IF’s	prescriptive	parsing.	Due	to	these	differences, chatbots	are	computational	personalities	who	may	in	the	course	of	conversation relate	narratives,	whereas	works	of	IF	are	in	themselves	computational narratives,	in	that	they	internally	compute	events	(Mailbox	→	Open)	which	are then	represented	(“You	open	the	mailbox”)	with	the	software	acting	in	the	role	of narrator.	The	difficulty	of	this	distinction	about	the	(simulated)	real	is	especially fascinating	where	it	breaks	down,	when	IF	authors	implement	chatbot-like characters,	and	in	so	doing	sometimes	making	their	thoughts,	moods,	and	topics of	conversation	objects	in	the	model	of	the	simulated	world	(e.g.	Short’s Galatea). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>MUDs	and	MOOs</p>
<p class="calibre1">Command	line	based	and	simulated,	Multi-User	Dimensions	and	MUDs-Object-Oriented	are	more	than	the	precursors	to	modern	graphical	MMOGs, they	are	the	communal	analog	to	IF,	and	have	in	common	with	IF	not	just	the command	line,	the	object	tree,	and	the	parser,	but	a	vast	array	of	shared conventions	growing	out	of	a	long	mutually	entangled	history.	Yet,	for	the purposes	of	this	study,	MUDs	are	part	of	what	IF	is	not	for	two	reasons:	first,	the experience	of	reading	IF	as	outlined	in	this	study	arises	in	part	out	of	sustained engagement	with	the	parser-interlocutor,	and	MUDs	(with	the	constant opportunity	for	interjection	by	other	users)	presume	no	such	sustained engagement.	Second,	MUDs	and	MOOs	introduce	the	aspect	of	time	in	ways that	crucially	change	the	nature	of	textual	exchange.	An	IF	at	a	crucial	juncture can	be	left	running	for	a	second,	or	an	hour,	or	a	week	before	entering	further text	at	the	command	line,	and	furthermore	entries	can	often	be	rescinded	and changes	reverted.	This	quality	enables	a	crucial	dynamic	that	encourages introspection	in	a	way	not	present	in	a	MUD,	where	pausing	to	contemplate	the apple	of	discord	enables	another	user	to	snatch	it	up. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Fa�ade</p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps	one	of	the	most	intriguing	(and	disconcerting)	command	line	based computational	dramas	of	the	last	decade	is	the	Michael	Mateas	and	Andrew Stern	research	project	Fa�ade	(2005),	an	apartment	drama	in	which	the interactor	may	be	audience,	provocateur,	or	facilitator	to	the	marriage	meltdown of	old	friends	Trip	and	Grace.	While	Fa�ade	provides	the	command	line	as	one key	part	of	its	user	interface,	it	is	the	culmination	of	a	radical	departure	from	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	many	ways.	Fa�ade	is	graphical	(it	simulates	a	visual	world,	rather	than reporting	on	it,	with	the	exception	of	printing	spoken	dialog),	kinetic	(the	user largely	speaks	through	the	command	line,	but	acts	physically	through	a	‘hand’</p>
<p class="calibre1">icon),	and	real-time	rather	than	turn-based	(time	in	the	simulated	world	goes	on regardless	of	input	or	lack	thereof).	There	are	many,	many	implications	of	these decisions,	but	the	most	important	is	that	Fa�ade	is	not	narrated,	explored,	or interrogated	in	the	sense	these	concepts	apply	to	IF.	Instead	Fa�ade	creates	a largely	unambiguous	visual	environment	within	which	it	situates	unambiguous</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a>physical	interactions	and	potentially	ambiguous	verbal	engagement	with	the simulated	personalities	of	Grace	and	Trip.	Typing	is	exclusively	a	form	of speaking	rather	than	acting,	navigating,	or	thinking.	This	combination	of dramatically	scripted	virtual	reality	with	chat	is	likewise	reflected	in	the	works of	other	Oz	Project	alumni	such	as	Zoesis,	Inc.‘s	The	Pearl	Demon.	I	will	be fascinated	to	see	where	Fa�ade	leads,	and	particularly	delighted	if	the development	tools	are	open	sourced	and	something	akin	to	the	IF	authoring community	emerges	around	them.	Nevertheless,	my	prediction	is	that	Fa�ade-like	computational	dramas	will	seldom	have	similar	aesthetics	or	encourage similar	artistic	explorations	to	those	of	IF	computational	narratives,	for	the simple	reason	that	Fa�ade	attempts	to	cleanly	disambiguate	exactly	the	points of	ambiguity	and	interesting	failure	that	have	been	so	central	to	the	recent developments	in	IF	aesthetics	treated	in	this	study. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>Abuses</p>
<p class="calibre1">A	work	may	be	command	line	based,	non-temporal,	single-user,	manage	an object-tree,	have	a	parser,	and	still	not	be	IF.	One	of	the	most	common	ways	is	to be	an	“abuse,”	an	IF	community	nickname	for	whimsical	projects	that	repurpose the	object-tree	and	parser	model	of	IF	development	languages	for	some	other form	of	HCI.	Abuses	might	play	textual	animations,	create	pseudo-graphical video	games,	or	(as	Short	suggests	above)	return	arbitrary	input	as	directly transcoded	output.	IF	abuses,	like	obfuscated	code	and	quines,	are	cultural artifacts	that	emerge	out	of	a	playful	engagement	with	what	IF	is,	and	they	can serve	to	remind	critics	in	our	more	serious	moments	of	what	shaky	ground	our formalities	stand	upon.	First,	they	recall	the	properties	of	the	Turing	Universal Machine,	and	how	easy	(or,	at	least,	possible)	it	is	to	reduce	the	complex	systems we	concretize	as	‘software’	to	the	manipulations	of	their	more	fundamental properties.	Second,	and	perhaps	more	importantly,	abuses	remind	us	that	IF,	if one	scratches	the	surface,	lies	only	lightly	over	the	figure	of	the	HCI	computer itself,	with	keyboard,	command	line,	and	screen,	input,	data,	process,	and	output. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	much	of	IF	aesthetics	are	also	the	aesthetics	of	the	PDP-10,	or	of	the archetypal	souls	of	our	newer	machines?	Of	the	differences	that	remain,	are	any procedural	or	systematic,	or	are	all	the	key	distinctions	of	IF	ultimately	questions of	voice,	style,	and	subject	matter? </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>Hypertext	Fiction</p>
<p class="calibre1">IF	is	not	hypertext	fiction,	except	of	course	when	it	is	hypertext	fiction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hybrids	in	fact	abound,	including	languages	like	HTMLTADS	and	multimedia Glulx	with	specific	augmentations	for	the	purpose	of	mixing	link-clicks	in	with typing	at	the	command	line.	These	moments	of	choice	(rather	than	projective statement)	can	be	smoothly	embedded	into	a	work	of	IF,	as	in	City	of	Secrets	in which	the	compass	rose	provides	navigational	commands	and	conversations suggest	hypertext-linked	default	topics	(while	still	allowing	creative	replies). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	hypertext-IF	hybrids	do	not	augment	the	command	line	interface	with links,	but	instead	come	at	the	issue	perpendicularly,	adding	an	IF	world-model	to the	hypertext	interface	of	linked-prose	navigation,  <i class="calibre3">e.g. </i>	Mike	Tolar’s	Clink:	A Clickable	Text	Adventure.	I’m	strongly	tempted	to	discount	world-modeled hypertext	as	not-IF,	for	the	simple	reason	that	they	do	not	solicit	freeform projective	statements,	and	thus	do	not	share	in	the	effects	of	works	that	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,	this	suggests	a	corollary:	in	a	command	line	IF	with	only	two	locations (HERE,	THERE),	two	objects	(APPLE,	BANANA),	and	two	available commands	(GO,	EAT),	should	the	work	be	considered	essentially	a	spatial hypertext,	as	it	is	read	through	navigation-selection	(not	exploration?).	My provisional	reply	is:	a)	only	if	the	available	commands	are	already	known, otherwise	guessing	fundamentally	changes	the	experience	from	hypertextual, even	if	the	commands	don’t	exist,	and	b)	even	if	the	commands	are	known,	only if	the	combinatorial	possibilities	of	the	space	are	low	enough	that	spatializing	the possibilities	is	a	plausible	reading	strategy,	otherwise	the	exploration	process	is still	not	hypertextual	reading. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>Nonfiction</p>
<p class="calibre1">There	is	one	final	thing	that	IF	isn’t,	and	that	is	poetry,	scholarly	essays,	or indeed	anything	that	isn’t	‘fiction’…	at	least,	in	theory.	In	practice,	there	are several	prominent	works	of	IF	that	push	the	borders	of	fiction,	being	lyric (Simone	Di	Conza’s	translation	of	Francesco	Cordella’s	The	Land	of	the Cyclops,	2002),	conceptual	(Plotkin’s	The	Space	Under	the	Window,	1997),	or philosophical	(Kevin	F.	Doughty’s	Threading	the	Labyrinth,	2000).	Still,	we don’t	yet	have	prominent	examples	of	interactive	nonfiction,	to	compare	say	to examples	of	scholarly	hypertext	such	as	George	Landow	and	Jon	Lanestedt’s The	Dickens	Web	(1992).	One	work	that	approaches	a	scholarly	hypertext	is Neil	deMause’s	Lost	New	York	(1996),	a	work	that	lavishly	documents	New York	City	circa	1780,	1880,	1905,	1954,	and	2040	via	a	time	travel	narrative	that often	seems	a	pretext	for	historical	documentary.	Adam	Cadre	remarks	in	his review	“Puzzles	vs.	History,”	“The	fact	that	the	game	begins	with	a	slideshow and	ends	with	a	bibliography	is	another	indication	of	where	the	author’s	interests lie.”	Yet,	despite	the	volume	and	weight	of	paratextual	reference	material,	Cadre notes	that	Lost	New	York	remains	strongly	shaped	by	the	formulae	of	fictional puzzle-driven	text	adventure	games.	Peter	Nepstad’s	1893:	a	World’s	Fair Mystery	(2002)	is	likewise	a	meticulously	researched	interactive	tribute	to	a historical	city	(here	Chicago	rather	than	New	York),	yet	remains	historical fiction	as	a	vehicle	for	history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	10.	Peter	Nepstad’s	1893:	a	World’s	Fair	Mystery	(2002)	featuring historically	descriptive	text	and	period	photography. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	dearth	of	nonfiction	IF	might	be	due	to	the	prominence	of	focalization	in IF,	even	in	such	unusual	works	as	The	Space	Under	the	Window.	If	narration	is inherent	in	parser	response	(regardless	of	tense),	character	is	implicit	in focalization	(agency	implies	agent),	and	interaction	varies	the	nature	of	reported events,	then	the	formula	of	narration	plus	character	plus	variable	representation strongly	implies	fiction.	Arguably	then	the	only	command	line	interactive nonfiction	would	be	focalized	on	a	‘you’	that	was	believably	continuous	with	the identity	of	the	interactor.	Still,	there	might	be	other	potential	modes;	it	is	hard not	to	suspect	that	the	formulation	of	IF	as	fiction	(rather	than	IL,	interactive literature)	doesn’t	presumptively	limit	exploration	of	certain	possibilities.	We can	summarize	our	own	specific	critique	of	the	term	IF	as	both	over-general	and over-specific.	The	term	IF	is	over-general	because	it	is	constituted	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>command	line,	a	specific	form	of	interactivity.	The	term	IF	is	also	over-specific because	it	is	a	form	of	literature,	not	necessarily	constrained	to	prose	fiction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	this,	we	can	posit	a	neologism	that	draws	a	better	approximation	around the	actual	body	of	extant	works,	both	excluding	and	including	correctly	where the	term	IF	does	not:	Command	Line	Literature	(CLL).	Command	Line Literature	specifies	both	the	manner	of	interaction	(the	command	line	parser) and	the	form	of	the	result	(literature:	things	made	of	letters).	To	the	extent	that these	works	are	challenges	or	contests	that	are	played	for	victory,	some	CLL</p>
<p class="calibre1">works	may	also	be	games,	while	others	may	not;	this	determination	involves	a subset	of	design	considerations	and	interactor	approaches.	An	open	question	for this	approach	is	whether	or	not	CLL	should	then	include	the	total	body	of chatbots,	MUDs,	abuses	�	that	is,	anything	which	combines	a	command	line with	textual	response,	regardless	of	software	architecture	or	other	disparate features	and	conventions.	While	CLL	might	be	a	provocative	categorical	lens	for the	approaches	of	future	interactive	textualists,	for	the	multitude	of	reasons already	given,	the	established	term	‘IF’	will	be	used	in	the	remainder	of	this study. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>Overview</p>
<p class="calibre1">How	does	IF	work,	and	what	does	it	teach	us	about	similar	new	media	forms (chatbots,	MUDs,	or	MMOGs),	or	about	interactive	narrative,	electronic literature	(eliterature),	and	literature	in	general?	I	address	these	questions	in chapter	two	through	a	cognitive	approach	to	IF	interaction	�	“implied	code”	�</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	a	method	of	close	interacting	which	engages	both	the	sense	and	the	source code	in	Andrew	Plotkin’s	Shade.	In	chapter	three,	I	consider	the	emergent aesthetics	of	error,	frustration,	and	alienation	as	they	relate	to	the	IF	protagonist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	chapter	four	I	examine	of	fundamental	interaction	design	patterns	present	in even	the	briefest	exchanges	(“minimal	interactivity”)	such	as	mood,	tense,	and precedence,	then	engage	in	close	interactions	of	exceptional	short	works	(Aisle, Shrapnel,	Rematch)	that	demonstrate	both	the	limits	of	IF	and	the	implications of	IF	aesthetics	for	literature,	hypertext	fiction,	and	film,	and	video	games. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	second	chapter,	“The	Implied	Code,”	moves	from	a	structural	and historical	understanding	of	the	command	line	to	a	theory	of	how	it	operates during	a	reader’s	response,	which	is	to	say	at	the	time	of	interaction.	The interactor	confronts	the	command	line	with	neither	obvious	affordances	nor	a strict	set	of	conventions	for	interaction,	and	must	therefore	guess	how	the	hidden code	might	work	in	order	to	proceed.	The	framework	for	these	guesses	is	what	I term	the	“implied	code,”	defined	as	an	interactor’s	mental	model	of	the operational	logic	of	the	interactive	work.	‘Implied’	emphasizes	both	difference from	the	actual	code	and	the	emergence	of	the	model	as	a	co-construction,	half expectations	of	the	interactor,	half	implications	of	the	text.	When	considered	as	a process	in	time,	the	formation	of	the	implied	code	can	generally	be	described	as a	coming-into-understanding.	In	contemporary	literary	IF,	the	interactor’s progress	in	learning	to	interact	is	often	paralleled	by	the	progress	of	the protagonist	within	the	work,	who	also	struggles	to	understand	something	within the	world	of	the	story.	Implied	code	sets	the	pace	of	a	dual	epiphany	that	is	both the	climax	and	the	conclusion:	the	character	understands	the	world	in	the moment	that	the	reader	understands	the	code,	and	at	that	moment	the	work	ends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Interactor	expectations	are	oriented	to	the	interactive	work	in	many	ways,	with a	range	exemplified	by	a	brief	survey	of	tutorial	stages	from	console	video games	(e.g.	Indigo	Prophecy,	Prince	of	Persia,	Psychonauts),	noting	in	particular how	the	tutorial	is	variously	incorporated	or	not	in	the	diegesis.	Distinguishing between	transcript	and	experience,	I	consider	comparisons	between	the	ethics	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>implied	code	and	Lawrence	Lessig’s	ideas	about	“code	as	law,”	as	well	as	the	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">“cruelty”	system	for	describing	interactive	difficulty	as	a	property	of	code. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Numerous	IF	critics	have	attempted	to	articulate	aesthetic	ideologies	of difficulty.	The	immediate	implication	of	implied	code	is	a	‘gap’	theory	of	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	attends	to	codes	that	are	unreliable,	deconstructive,	imitative	 <i class="calibre3">etc. </i>	Implied code	can	be	partially	described	in	terms	of	several	common	vocabularies	from critical	theory,	including	fabula	 <i class="calibre3">sjuzet	and	the	implied	author	</i> implied	reader.	Iser in	particular	has	been	repurposed	many	times	by	IF	critics	dealing	with	various aspects	of	the	IF	work;	I	categorize	these	applications	to	clarify	their	differences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	particular,	attempting	to	formalize	the	study	of	gaps	in	code	based	on	victory or	strategic	advancement	tends	to	obfuscate	the	fact	of	experience,	as	we	see	in actual	analyses	of	works	such	as	Marc	Blank’s	Deadline. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reflecting	again	on	the	implications	of	this	experiential	IF	code	aesthetics	for an	IF	code	ethics,	Jacques	Derrida’s	work	in	Archive	Fever	suggests	a	general vocabulary	for	thinking	about	the	code	configuration	of	parser	and	database	as archon	and	archive.	Following	Derrida’s	thoughts	on	the	archive	as historiography,	Linda	Hutcheon’s	similar	definition	of	historiographic metafiction	in	terms	of	detectives	presents	us	with	a	potential	figure	for	the interactor.	Triangulating	the	archive	and	the	detective,	I	propose	the	figure	and configuration	of	the	executor,	will,	and	estate	as	an	analytic	metaphor	for	the command	line	situation	with	broad	significance	to	a	range	of	related	works	new media	and	metafictional	works	all	characterized	by	what	I	term	the	information fetish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	conclude	by	conducting	an	extended	close	interaction	of	Andrew	Plotkin’s Shade	that	situates	the	work	in	the	context	of	the	history	of	generic	tropes	in	IF, whose	ur-text	was	a	spelunking	simulation	that	evolved	into	the	fantastical dungeon	crawl	of	an	underground	empire.	I	argue	that	this	“cavern	fiction” </p>
<p class="calibre1">tradition,	while	it	has	elicited	a	long	history	of	homage	from	many	interactive fiction	authors,	has	also	had	a	more	important	and	unique	impact	on	the	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">genre:	the	code	and	libraries	of	interactive	fiction	languages	have	been optimized	to	handle	light	in	a	manner	similar	to	spelunking,	in	particular	the simulation	(and	absence)	of	light	and	the	idea	of	the	dark.	This	analysis demonstrates	the	importance	of	reading	source	code	in	the	digital	humanities, because	without	knowledge	of	how	the	tools	of	simulation	have	been	passed down	through	the	genre,	we	cannot	perceive	the	inheritance	aesthetics	whereby generic	tropes	and	conventions	become	codified	transmitted.	In	my	reading	of both	prose	and	code,	I	argue	that	“Shade”	does	not	simply	reenact	the	tradition</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>of	light	in	IF,	but	alludes	to	it,	plays	with	it,	and	ultimately	dispenses	with	it	�</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	it	dispenses	with	the	dimensions	of	space	and	time.	Enlightenment,	rather	than light,	is	what	the	work	attempts	to	model,	and	in	doing	so	it	stands	in conversation	with	the	simulation,	game,	and	fantasy	traditions	in	IF,	while	being unmistakably	literary	in	conception.	In	elucidating	how	the	normative	second person	mode	of	Shade	is	established	(and	later	destabilized),	first	draw	out	the historical	confluence	of	origins	among	IF,	gamebooks,	and	RPGs	�	which	I term	semiotic	simulations	�	and	then	consider	the	idea	of	the	“second	person camera”	and	comparisons	between	simulated	immediacy	in	IF	and	film (Terminator,	Predator)	or	video	games	(Doom,	2ndPS,	Battletoads),	in	particular critiquing	the	idea	that	formal	parallels	hold	across	media,	and	instead highlighting	comparisons	between	sets	of	work-audience	relationships. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	third	chapter,	“The	Aesthetics	of	Error,”	considers	how	the	idea	of	implied code	and	the	mandate	of	the	executor	can	illuminate	the	emergence	of	aesthetics of	frustration	and	error	in	the	IF	genre.	Like	hypertext	fiction	after	it,	the commercial	text	adventures	that	inaugurated	the	personal	computer	game industry	were	heralded	as	liberatory,	with	command	line	interaction	billed	as	an open-ended	alternative	to	the	confines	of	the	novel	that	supposedly	freed	the reader	from	the	confines	of	linear	authorial	intention.	Yet	the	genre	of	IF	is	often highly	frustrating	to	newcomers	and	to	seasoned	interactors	alike,	who experience	IF	as	a	tightly	defined	system	of	rigid	constraints,	within	which	the reader	struggles	(often	unsuccessfully)	to	read.	The	frustrations	of	IF	have	been attributed	on	the	one	hand	to	the	genre’s	tradition	of	puzzles,	which	strive	to create	difficult	challenges,	and	on	the	other	hand	to	the	inherent	limitations	of the	command	line	interface,	in	particular	the	strategy	of	freeform	language parsing	that	leaves	open	the	continual	possibility	of	misunderstanding	and	error. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Less	noted	has	been	the	confluence	of	two	trends	in	IF:	one	towards	the incorporation	of	fewer	formally	challenging	puzzles,	and	another	towards	the rise	of	a	particular	kind	of	protagonist,	one	radically	alienated	from	agency.	I argue	that	these	trends	are	reflective	of	a	general	move	in	literary	IF	towards incorporating	the	limits	of	the	medium	as	its	strengths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	many	interactive	media	provide	choices	in	a	way	that	paradoxically emphasizes	constraint,	literary	IF	incorporates	the	incapacities	of	the	command line	parser	as	elements	of	the	storyworld	situation,	often	through	the	figure	of	a protagonist	who	lacks	the	normal	capacity	to	act:	disoriented	(Adam	Cadre’s 9:05),	hallucinating	(Stephen	Granade’s	Losing	Your	Grip),	malfunctioning	(Dan Shiovitz’s	Bad	Machine),	un-evolved	(Lucian	P.	Smith’s	The	Edifice),	blind	or</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a>even	dying	(Andrew	Plotkin’s	Hunter	in	Darkness	and	Shade),	and	so	on.	It	is the	hallmark	of	the	contemporary	IF	protagonist	to	be	crazy,	dreaming,	lost, marooned,	trapped,	displaced,	or	otherwise	alienated	in	such	a	way	as	to	make successful	interaction	with	the	world	an	immediate	challenge.	In	this	context, error	messages	are	not	a	failure	of	the	interface	to	provide	pure	agency,	but rather	a	crucial	part	of	the	aesthetic	project	of	a	work,	as	they	relate	how	and why	agency	is	radically	limited.	This	is	crucial	because	this	situation	must	be understood	by	interactor	and	protagonist	in	order	to	be	overcome.	Error messages	are	neglected	under	many	theories	of	interactivity	due	to	the	mistaken assumption	that	nothing	noteworthy	has	‘happened’	if	the	state	of	the	simulated world	has	not	changed.	This	is	a	failure	of	analyzing	new	media	as	systems rather	than	cybernetic	feedback	loops	that	include	the	interactor.	Analyzing</p>
<p class="calibre1">“implied	code”	emphasizes	that	something	crucial	has	changed	after	the production	of	an	error	message	�	the	mental	model	in	the	interactor’s	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	consider	how	the	aesthetics	of	frustration	in	IF	differ	from	hypertextual navigation,	and	in	particular	consider	how	the	cybertextual	textonomy	is	unable to	account	for	frustration	and	error	in	its	model.	Surveying	the	critical	theory characterizing	IF	as	frustrating	(and	as	artful),	I	consider	in	particular	metaphor of	IF	as	riddle-art	�	its	rhetorical	strengths	and	potential	critical	drawbacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riddles	are	one	of	many	aesthetics	of	productive	frustration.	I	argue	that aesthetics	against	frustration	are	founded	on	a	crucial	misunderstanding:	first	of the	interactor	as	wielding	a	pure	‘puppet’	or	avatar	(an	untenable	configuration in	ambiguous	semiotic	simulation)	and,	by	extension,	of	an	interactor	liberated from	code	constraint,	a	myth	of	anarchic	freedom	that	I	suggest	replacing	with discussion	of	productive	engagement	in	terms	of	enfranchisement.	As	an alternative	productive	vocabulary,	I	propose	directing	protagonists	(rather	than playing	player	characters). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Returning	to	the	theme	of	IF	successfully	or	unsuccessfully	scripting expectations,	I	question	the	recurring	idea	that	expectation	scripting	led	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">authors	into	the	necessary	use	of	generic	fictional	tropes	.	Tracing	a	critique	of failed	and	dysfunctional	parsers	and	IF	works	that	has	repeatedly	characterized IF	characters,	systems,	and	interactors	in	terms	of	autism,	I	argue	that	this	is	a misunderstanding	of	objectivism	in	the	system,	but	that	the	representations	of incapacity	and	disability	(and,	more	generally,	the	questioning	of	normative agency)	is	a	core	aesthetic	strategy	of	IF	that,	along	with	amnesia,	solves	several core	design	problems. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a>My	fourth	chapter,	“Minimal	Interactivity,”	examines	that	work	of	IF	at	the level	of	a	single	interaction,	in	metaphoric	comparison	to	Prince’s	“minimal story.”	Considered	in	contrast	to	closure	in	comics,	closure	in	IF	is	prospective rather	than	retrospective	in	time.	I	consider	strong	normative	stance	of	second person	present	tense	work	in	the	canon,	and	look	at	the	aesthetic	effects	of shifting	to	first	and	third	person	or	to	the	past	tense.	Finally,	I	consider	basic distinctions	between	the	concepts	of	minimal	activity,	reactivity,	and interactivity,	as	well	as	the	framing	idea	of	minimalism	in	relation	to	games. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Exploring	the	tension	in	short	works	between	traversals	that	end	and	sessions that	constantly	restart,	I	consider	“time	loop”	fictions,	including	looped structures	such	as	Joyce’s	novel	Finnegans	Wake	and	the	representation	of repetition	in	films	like	Groundhog	Day	and	Lola	Rennt.	I	turn	to	extended	close interactions	with	a	series	of	short	IF	works	that	trouble	the	idea	of	minimal sessions	and	play	with	circular	time,	including	Aisle	by	Sam	Barlow,	Shrapnel by	Adam	Cadre,	and	Rematch	by	Andrew	Pontious.	All	of	these	works	locate frustration	and	alienation	less	in	the	figure	of	the	protagonist	than	in	the	special state	of	the	world,	which	is	either	a	dream	exhibiting	heavy	Freudian condensation	or	else	a	trap	of	space-time	crafted	by	some	divine	force.	Where Aisle	popularized	the	sub-genre	of	“one-move”	IF,	Rematch	elaborates	on	this idea	of	the	single	interaction	by	embedding	it	within	an	infinite	loop	that	refuses to	end.	In	my	reading	of	both	prose	and	code,	I	explore	how	the	process	of discovering	an	escape	from	a	dangerous	situation	simultaneously	explores	the protagonist’s	emotional	frustrations	with	his	life.	The	true	resolution	is simultaneously	instrumental	and	philosophical. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">The	Implied	Code:</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">IF	as	mental	model,	mystery,	and	tradition</p>
<p class="calibre1">Having	considered	interactive	fiction	and	the	command	line	historically	and conceptually,	we	can	now	move	to	a	theory	of	how	it	functions	as	a	process	at the	time	of	interaction.	The	IF	interactor	confronts	the	command	line	with neither	obvious	affordances	nor	a	strict	set	of	conventions	for	interaction,	and must	therefore	guess	at	how	the	hidden	code	might	work	in	order	to	proceed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	framework	for	these	guesses	is	what	I	term	the	“implied	code,”	defined	as an	interactor’s	mental	model	of	the	operational	logic	of	the	interactive	work.	As the	interactor	engages	the	IF	work,	she	accumulates	a	set	of	hypotheses	about	its structure:	what	commands	are	understood,	what	actions	are	possible,	what desirable	states	might	lead	to	what	resolutions,	how	far	the	scope	of	the simulation	extends,	and	so	forth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	say	that	implied	code	models	“operational	logic”	I	mean	a	set	of behaviors	on	the	part	of	software,	whether	perceived	by	the	user	as	tendencies, rules,	or	laws.	For	this	reason	the	formation	of	an	implied	code	is	a	normal	(and largely	unconscious)	process	for	any	interactor,	regardless	of	her	level	of technical	experience	or	sophistication.	To	possess	an	“implied	code”	does	not require	that	the	interactor	be	a	skilled	programmer	with	an	aptitude	for imagining	precompiled	syntax;	in	fact,	the	presence	or	absence	of	such imaginings	is	beside	the	point.	The	interactor	may	be	somewhat	inexperienced	or totally	computer	illiterate,	but	regardless	of	her	circumstances	she	will	posses	an implied	code	to	the	extent	that	she	recognizes	the	code	as	a	phenomenon	in	the normal	manner	outlined	by	behavioral,	environmental,	and	situational psychology.	As	a	set	of	expectations	implied	code	is	not	strictly	limited	to interactive	systems,	but	rather	general	to	what	we	might	call	the	phenomenology of	software.	In	the	case	of	IF,	however,	the	predictive	power	of	the	implied	code model	is	in	particular	focused	on	interaction,	exemplified	by	the	question	“How might	my	input	be	understood,	and	what	type	of	response	might	I	expect?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Expectation	and	diegesis	in	video	game	tutorials Many	factors	may	influence	the	expectations	with	which	an	interactor	engages</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>an	interactive	work.	While	our	focus	will	be	the	play	of	expectation	during	the process	of	interaction,	many	influences	on	expectation	are	fully	formed	before interaction	begins.	Some	involve	how	inherently	knowable	the	interface	is	(as opposed	to	random,	pseudo-random,	or	shifting),	while	others	involve	the	stance, abilities,	and	limitations	of	the	interactor.	Others	involve	the	familiarity	of	the interactor	with	other	works	in	general	(media	literacy	or	game	literacy)	or	in specific.	Examples	include	familiarity	with	genre	conventions	(e.g.	expecting	the ability	to	leap	by	a	certain	method	in	Jordan	Mechner’s	Prince	of	Persia:	The Sands	of	Time	(2003)	because	it	is	a	member	of	the	‘platformer’	genre),	or	with precedents	(e.g.	expecting	the	ability	to	rebound	from	walls	by	a	certain	method in	Kevin	Guillemette’s	Prince	of	Persia:	Warrior	Within	(2004)	because	it	was previously	available	in	The	Sands	of	Time),	or	with	various	paratexts,	whether those	be	epitexts	(Prince	of	Persia	manuals,	guides,	reviews	etc.)	or	peritexts	(in-software	hints,	control	diagrams,	configuration	screens	etc.). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	11.	Peritext	controller	diagrams	from	Prince	of	Persia:	The	Sands	of Time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	discussing	implied	code,	my	emphasis	is	on	the	interactor’s	mental	model as	formed	at	the	time	of	interaction	and	in	the	diegesis	of	an	interactive	fiction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	distinction	is	not	a	simple	one.	In-software	materials	designed	to	set interactor	expectations	run	the	gamut	from	the	non-interactive	and	extradiegetic to	the	interactive	and	diegetic,	with	many	intermediate	and	partial	positions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Although	the	player	is	oriented	through	non-diegetic	captions	(e.g.	“Left analog	stick	controls	Prince”),	The	Sands	of	Time	uses	direct	address	from	the Prince	to	an	unnamed	narratee	in	an	unconventional	place:	system	messages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whenever	the	protagonist	dies	or	the	player	saves,	quits,	or	performs	other actions	that	require	the	system	to	suture	time,	the	interruption	is	accompanied	by the	Prince’s	voiceover,  <i class="calibre3">e.g. </i>	after	death:	“No	no	no…	that	didn’t	happen	either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let	me	begin	again.”	System	menu	selections	likewise	elicit	statements	that appear	to	emanate	from	some	frametale,  <i class="calibre3">e.g. </i>	Restart:	“Now,	where	was	I?”	and Quit:	“Do	you	wish	me	to	leave	before	finishing	my	story?”	While	the	narrative cannot	accommodate	the	player’s	knowledge	of	physical	interfaces	(such	as	right analog	sticks),	it	can	accommodate	menus	and	memory	cards.	In	the	penultimate scene,	we	learn	the	Prince	has	been	addressing	the	Princess	Farah	in	a	grand recounting	that	occurs	just	prior	to	the	climactic	battle.	This	suggests	that	all	our</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a>mistakes	as	players	have	a	diegetic	explanation	in	Farrah’s	difficulties	accepting the	plot	as	presented.	When	a	player	mistakenly	dies,	this	does	not	represent	the Prince	bizarrely	misremembering	his	own	death,	but	rather	Farah’s	unheard objections	that	the	Prince	should	have	died,	which	is	in	turn	brushed	aside	by	the Prince	as	non-authorized	(“No,	that	didn’t	happen.”)	By	reaching	the	end	of	the game	and	resolving	it,	we	justify	the	Prince’s	authority,	proving	what	did	happen and	finally	incorporating	extradiegetic	interactivity	into	the	diegesis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	15.	The	character	Issun	mixing	diegetic	and	extradiegetic	explanations of	saving	in	Ōkami. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	is	a	final	mode	of	framing	expectations	about	interaction	to	consider,	in which	the	controls	are	directly	explained	within	the	diegesis.	An	excellent example	of	this	is	the	Hideki	Kamiya	third-person	action-adventure	Ōkami (2006),	in	which	the	player	controls	a	white	wolf	�	the	reincarnation	of	the Shinto	goddess	Ameratsu	�	as	it	struggles	to	discover	the	artistic	techniques that	can	restore	a	Japanese	village	and	free	the	land	from	evil	spirits.	Like Shadow	of	the	Colossus	or	Sands	of	Time,	Ōkami	integrates	the	orientation	of the	player	to	the	controls	during	an	introductory	quest,	River	of	the	Heavens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike	those	works,	however,	Ameratsu	is	accompanied	by	a	diegetic	character who	serves	simultaneously	as	both	comic	commentary	and	the	voice	of	the system.	This	voice	is	Issun,	a	one-inch	tall	artist	who	accompanies	both Ameratsu	and	the	player,	and	freely	addresses	both.	His	utterances	may	prompt Ameratsu’s	attention	or	model	action	(e.g.	“Hey	look!	Are	those	stars	forming	a pattern,	or	is	it	just	me?”	“Guess	I’ll	just	have	to	draw	the	missing	star!”)	or	may instead	speak	directly	to	the	player	holding	the	controller	(“Press	the	R1	button to	hold	the	brush,	then	the	☐	button	to	draw”).	As	the	voice	of	the	system,	Issun is	playful	about	this	inconsistency,	as	for	example	when	introducing	the	mystic structures	that	signify	points	where	the	player	can	save	the	game,	Issun	describes how	if	gazed	into	“your	memories	will	be	stored	in	the	mirror	for	all	eternity!” </p>

<p class="calibre1">An	interesting	contrast	to	this	rupture	is	the	Halo	series	of	games	by	Bungie Studios	for	the	Xbox	console.	In	the	beginning	of	the	first	Halo:	Combat Evolved,	configuration	of	the	“vertical	looking”	control	is	integrated	into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>diegesis:	the	recently	defrosted	cyborg	Master	Chief	is	being	reoriented	and needs	a	vision	test.	This	orientation	is	a	cyborg	moment,	as	the	Master	Chief, like	a	robot	(or	the	player),	can	have	his	neck	impulses	‘inverted’	by	the technicians	during	an	eye	exam.	By	Halo	3	even	this	conceit	reduced	to	its	barest essence.	A	medic	holds	up	a	light	and	asks	the	Master	Chief	to	“look	up,”	with either	corresponding	thumb	motion	interpreted	as	an	implicit	configurative	act. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	of	these	examples	are	responses	to	the	problem	of	specifying	interaction and	teaching	the	interface,	and	while	the	approaches	to	form	of	address	and diegesis	are	quite	varied,	they	reflect	a	broad	consensus	that	it	is	the responsibility	of	games	to	orient	and	educate	their	players	and	that	they	may reflect	a	general	progression	away	from	representing	the	interaction	model purely	in	epitexts	(manuals)	that	has	moved	through	peritexts	(help	menus)	into tutorial	sequences,	and	now	focuses	on	the	integration	of	tutorial	design	into	the diegesis.	This	may	in	part	represent	a	valuation	of	learning	in	games,	and	a desire	to	participate	in	shaping	the	proximal	development	of	the	player’s abilities.	Conversely,	it	may	also	represent	a	deep	impatience	with	learning,	and a	forceful	method	of	evoking	the	perfect	implied	player	of	a	game	as	quickly	as possible	so	as	to	get	interface	ambiguity	out	of	the	way.	This	is	not	to	say	that many	games	do	not	spread	out	learning,	particularly	those	with	complex interfaces.	Ōkami,	for	example,	teaches	the	player	how	to	draw	13	magic	brush strokes	over	the	course	of	the	game,	while	Psychonauts	teaches	a	sequence	of new	psychic	abilities	spread	across	dozens	of	hours	of	play.	By	and	large, however,	the	function	of	the	tutorial	is	to	resolve	the	interface,	dispensing	with the	mystery	of	agency	so	that	the	game	can	focus	on	skill	(e.g.	not	how	to	attack, but	when	is	the	optimal	moment)	or	content	(e.g.	not	how	to	unearth	an	item,	but where	it	is	located	or	which	one	to	pick	up). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	function	of	the	tutorial,	in	other	words,	is	to	resolve	the	potential	danger of	the	player	not	knowing	interaction	mechanics;	tutorials	address	the fundamental	problem	of	how.	In	comparison	to	the	contemporary	narrative videogame,	one	might	say	that	contemporary	narrative	IF	is	almost	a	tutorial genre,	in	that	works	tend	to	end	at	the	moment	that	mastering	the	interface concludes.	In	contrast,	we	might	rather	say	that	IF	does	not	seek	an	efficient resolution	to	the	problem	of	how,	but	rather	seeks	an	evocative	exploration	of	the problematic	of	how;	this	is	its	primary	design	space. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Availability	of	transcript	and	ethics	of	code</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a>So	we	return	at	last	to	implied	code,	which	is	so	central	to	understanding	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">because	it	is	at	its	heart	a	network	of	hows.	Like	the	operational	logic	it	is	based on,	implied	code	generally	predicts	structures	and	syntax	of	interaction	rather than	any	specific	content.	For	example,	an	IF	interactor	typing	“&gt;	TALK	TO</p>
<p class="calibre1">CLAUDIUS”	might	have	a	strong	expectation	that	the	system	will	understand the	action	as	speech	(as	opposed	for	example	for	assuming	that	the	interactor	is referring	to	an	object	named	TALK	that	should	be	given	to	Claudius).	In addition,	the	interactor	might	have	a	weak	expectation	that	the	system	will respond	with	a	speech	act	from	the	character	addressed.	Little	can	be	expected, however,	about	what	precisely	will	be	said	�	at	least,	little	that	relates	to	one’s conception	of	the	code.	Expectations	about	how	it	would	be	appropriate	for	the protagonist’s	uncle	to	react	at	this	point	in	the	discourse	are	part	of	an	entirely different	order	of	knowledge	from	the	implied	code,	which	is	concerned primarily	with	how	the	Claudius	object	may	be	affected	in	the	simulation	and what	type	of	changes	might	result	from	a	given	action.	Rather	than	“If	I	do	A, the	next	story	event	will	be	B,”	predictions	take	a	form	more	similar	to	“If	I input	interaction	A,	then	the	parser	will	understand	the	input	as	of	type	X,	and	a change	of	type	Y	will	occur.”	Here	we	might	describe	implied	codes	cognitively in	terms	of	schema	theory;	implied	codes	are	in	this	sense	particular	kinds	of schemata	that	map	software	behaviors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because	it	is	a	mode	of	knowledge	acquisition,	implied	code	is	usually	in	the process	of	forming,	but	may	not	develop	during	interactions	that	fail	to	map input	to	output	due	to	inattention	or	confusion.	For	example,	when	playing	a fighting	arcade	games	such	as	one	from	the	Samurai	Showdown	or	Street	Fighter series,	combinations	of	joystick	motions	and	button	presses	render	different fighting	maneuvers;	a	private	language	of	maneuvers	is	available	for	each character	out	of	a	set	of	potential	avatars.	While	the	question	“what	does	this button	do?”	does	not	necessarily	originate	out	of	the	implied	code	(as	there	is	no hypothesis),	the	observed	result	may	be	added	to	the	implied	code,	refining	the interaction	model.	On	the	other	hand,	rapidly	pushing	buttons	without	attention to	which	or	how	(“button-mashing”)	may	expand	but	not	refine	the	implied code,	no	matter	how	impressive	the	maneuver	produced;	something	new	may have	been	discovered	about	the	vocabulary	of	available	maneuvers,	but	not	how it	is	evoked.	If	one	can	‘read’	the	process	of	interaction,	then	button-mashing	is the	limit	on	that	form	of	reading.	Other	types	of	confusions	are	also	possible	�</p>
<p class="calibre1">forgetting,	for	example.	IF	is	particularly	susceptible	to	the	problem	of interactors	remember	how	something	was	done	and	why	but	become	confused over	the	precise	symbolic	representation.	For	example,	remembering	that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>conversation	with	a	guard	on	the	topic	of	a	door	is	different	from	remembering the	syntax	ASK	GUARD	ABOUT	DOOR	vs.	TELL	GUARD	ABOUT	DOOR</p>
<p class="calibre1">vs.	TALK	TO	GUARD	vs.	GUARD,	TELL	ME	ABOUT	DOOR	and	so	forth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IF	works	might	be	vulnerable	to	misremembered	interaction	in	unique	ways, but	most	are	also	uniquely	adapted	to	address	the	problems	remembering interaction.	An	IF	work	typically	features	a	scrolling-transcript	style	interface that	records	past	commands	interleaved	their	corresponding	responses.	The	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">transcript	history	(which	scrolls	up	from	the	command	line	like	a	ticker-tape	as the	IF	session	proceeds)	is	almost	unique	in	its	accessibility	compared	to common	user	interfaces	for	hypertext,	video	games,	interactive	drama	and	so forth.	This	aspect	of	command-line	display	is	not	universal.	Some	command	line works	either	record	the	input	transcript	in	a	separate	pane	or	accept	input	into	a single	bar	with	no	record.	Indeed,	IF	once	routinely	omitted	the	transcript	as	part of	the	display,	leading	Niesz	and	Holland	to	observe	in	1984	that	“one	cannot look	back	at	what	went	before	[…].	Thus,	in	a	literal	sense,	there	is	no	text, nothing	that	could	be	put	on	a	shelf	and	pointed	to	as	the	source	of	roughly similar	experiences	by	readers.”	(120).	Regardless,	the	transcript	history	today	is a	widespread	default	convention	of	compilers	and	parsers.	This	constant presence	of	the	recent	past	in	IF	interactions	is	unusual	for	an	interactive	new media	genre.	Breadcrumb	trails	that	lead	backward	are	of	course	possible	in	all interactive	digital	media,	and	have	been	experimented	with	(although	seldom made	conventions)	in	many,	from	hypertexts	(e.g.	the	Eastgate	history	menu)	to video	games	(e.g.	Prince	of	Persia:	Sands	of	Time)	to	interactive	video installations.	Even	in	these	cases	it	is	rare	to	find	an	exportable	transcript,	or some	a	record	of	experience	that	can	“be	put	on	a	shelf	and	pointed	to.”	Auto-transcribing	and	auto-recording	works	enable	a	uniquely	robust	construction	of the	implied	code;	the	traces	they	leave	behind	create	the	potential	for	them	to	be reflected	more	clearly	in	the	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Implied	code	is	itself	neither	a	set	of	instructions	nor	a	transcript	of	past interactions.	The	code	that	takes	shape	in	the	mind	of	the	interactor	is	in	some sense	a	reflection	of	the	source	code,	byte	code,	or	machine	code	it	stands	in relation	to,	but	the	normal	result	is	a	translation	into	a	set	of	an	abstractly conceived	network	of	opportunities,	allowances	and	prohibitions.	At	the command	line,	whose	blind	input	mode	encourages	(and	punishes) experimentation,	these	prohibitions	such	as	error	messages	may	take	on disproportional	weight	in	the	implied	code	�	disproportional	to	the	form	of	the source,	that	is,	although	not	perhaps	to	the	transcript	of	the	experience.	Just	as	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a>rigorously	enforced	legal	code	becomes	remarkable	not	for	its	disparate	features but	for	those	few	passages	that	most	impact	the	life	of	a	citizen,	the	real	code (which,	by	its	nature,	is	rigorously	and	automatically	enforced)	is	noted	and understood	by	the	user	where	it	enables	and	constrains	in	perceptible	ways.	This comparison	between	software	code	and	legal	code	recalls	the	work	of	Lawrence Lessig,	who	in	Code	and	Other	Laws	of	Cyberspace	(1999)	writes	concisely</p>
<p class="calibre1">“code	is	law”	(6).	Coming	from	a	background	in	legal	studies,	Lessig	became concerned	about	the	increasing	uses	of	technology	to	control	the	individual.	In Lessig’s	model,	an	individual’s	ability	to	act	is	constrained	by	four interdependent	modalities	or	regulators:	laws,	markets,	social	norms,	and architecture.	Most	importantly	for	our	purposes,	architecture	is	Lessig’s	term	for any	medium	or	technology,	including	code	(89).	Lessig	is	not	anti-regulation; what	disturbs	him	about	contemporary	trends	in	cyberspace	and	software	is	not code’s	use	to	regulate	per	se,	but	rather	the	way	code	is	used	as	a	form	of	indirect regulation	(e.g.	embedded	Digital	Rights	Management),	subsuming	and	hiding constraints	in	code	that	should	more	properly	be	negotiated	in	social	contracts	or the	open	market. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	17.	Lessig’s	four-regulator	model	as	depicted	in	Code	2.0.	Here	law	is shown	exerting	indirect	regulation	via	the	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Constraining	and	disciplinary	functions	are	only	one	part	of	code’s importance,	of	course.	Architecture	(whether	structure,	medium,	technology,	or source)	can	be	both	limiting	and	enabling.	In	fact,	these	aspects	are	often inseparable,	as	the	bridge	often	constrains	access	to	the	water	with	the	same structure	it	uses	to	enable	passage	from	shore	to	shore.	Lessig’s	focus,	however, is	on	the	ways	code	conceals	regulation,	either	obscuring	its	effects	or naturalizing	those	effects	and	thus	rendering	them	invisible.	In	this	light,	gaps between	what	code	actually	does	and	what	we	perceive	it	to	do	register	as sinister.	By	declaring	“code	is	law,”	Lessig	hopes	to	take	a	multitude	of contemporary	software	processes	and	render	them	socially	visible,	like	a	farmer of	the	enclosure	era	crying	“Fences	are	law!”	to	mobilize	the	commons	and	avert disaster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	Lessig	considers	the	individual’s	knowledge	of	code	at	length	and	from many	angles,	he	deals	with	no	concept	analogous	to	“implied	code”	because	he is	engaged	with	different	concerns.	He	begins	from	the	assumption	that	all	code tends	to	be	underunderstood	and	that	this	situation	has	no	appreciable	utilitarian benefits.	Within	his	prevue,	this	could	arguably	be	the	case.	While	many</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p70"></a>cryptography	systems,	Digital	Rights	Management	systems,	and	“security-through-obscurity”	systems	depend	on	hidden	or	obfuscated	code	in	order	to function,	and	while	many	utilizing	such	systems	will	advocate	them,	critiquing both	the	social	efficacy	and	effectiveness	of	such	systems	is	one	of	the	major projects	of	the	free	software	and	copyright	reform	movements	with	which	Lessig is	associated.	I	personally	subscribe	to	many	of	the	same	ideals	and	concerns regarding	the	relationship	of	code	to	desired	transparency	in	law	and	society,	but it	is	perhaps	unsurprising	that	the	mirror-world	of	aesthetic	study	has	led	me towards	a	diametrically	opposed	opinion	about	obscurity	in	code,	which	I	tend	to view	as	admirable	rather	than	pernicious.	Whether	or	not	utilitarian	code	can	be beneficially	obscure,	the	obscurity	of	artful	code	does	have	a	clear	benefit.	Artful code	can	be	obscure	in	order	that	its	obscurity	may	be	overcome.	It	is	possible that	the	sole	purpose	of	IF	code	is	being	overcome,	such	that	enduring	in obscurity	(which	might	represent	a	triumph	in	cryptography)	would	represent	the failure	of	the	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	have	been	considering	the	broadest	possible	implications	of	code	by sketching	code’s	general	stance	with	regard	to	ethics	and	morality.	This	latest concept	of	IF’s	benevolent	and	even	loyal	opposition	to	the	interactor	expands the	possible	valences	of	our	code	anthropomorphism.	We	can	expand	the possibilities	further	by	considering	practical	discussions	of	IF	ethics,	as	the concept	of	anthropomorphic	IF	code	is	not	unique	to	academic	philosophy.	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">authors	and	interactors	have	discussed	the	openness	of	code	and	the	relative	ease or	difficulty	with	which	it	is	overcome	in	both	theoretical	and	practical	terms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	best	examples	of	this	is	a	popular	rating	system	in	IF,	a	set	of	labels used	to	identify	the	difficulty	of	an	IF	game	in	anthropomorphic	terms.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Zarfian	Cruelty	Scale”	rates	games	as	Merciful,	Polite,	Tough,	Nasty,	or	Cruel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	scale	describes	how	works	of	IF	become	unwinnable,	especially	how	and when	the	interactor	(here	a	player,	and	one	trying	to	win)	learns	this.	The	highest cruelty	levels	indicates	that	the	game	can	easily	be	put	into	an	irrevocably unwinnable	state	without	warning	and	perhaps	even	without	notice	even	after	the fact.	One	of	the	fascinating	things	about	the	Cruelty	Scale	is	that	it	is	not	a difficulty	rating	in	any	traditional	sense.	It	has	no	correspondence	to	evaluating the	reading	level	(e.g.	accessibility	of	the	prose	to	varying	education	levels),	and it	has	little	if	anything	to	do	with	evaluating	the	critical	thinking	level	(e.g.	the difficulty	of	any	conceptual	leaps	required	to	progress).	Instead,	the	Cruelty Scale	focuses	solely	on	evaluating	the	way	that	code	moderates	action	and enables	or	hinders	progress	towards	its	own	revelation	�	particularly	when	and to	what	extent	the	system	reveals	information	about	its	own	state.	An	IF	work</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>might	require	reorienting	a	globe	by	hidden	compass	degrees,	decrypting	a	word from	a	2D	array	of	letters,	or	discerning	the	significance	of	five	book	names selected	from	the	Bible,	and	it	can	still	be	rated	“Merciful.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	18.	Evaluating	cruelty	in	works	of	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">This	is	precisely	the	case	of	Sam	Gordon’s	terribly	difficult	(yet	categorically merciful)	IF	Final	Selection	(2006),	whose	HELP	notes	read	in	part: Nothing	in	the	game	can	inflict	a	fatal	injury	on	the	player	and	it	should	not	be possible	to	manipulate	the	objects	so	as	to	make	the	game	unwinnable,	until	the very	end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	most	hostile	rating	(“cruel”)	is	distinguished	neither	for	“fatal	injury,”	nor for	how	often	or	how	unfairly	the	IF	simulation	enters	an	unwinnable	state,	but instead	for	concealing	that	fact	from	the	interactor	both	before	and	after	it	has occurred.	Concealing	the	fact	after	the	work	becomes	unwinnable	in	some	ways represents	the	outer	limit	on	the	concept	of	the	code	as	benevolent	opponent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	the	work	becomes	silently	unwinnable,	an	interactor	could	spend	minutes or	days	trying	to	master	it,	never	knowing	she	had	entered	a	wasteland	beyond reason.	Still,	perhaps	it	is	still	a	matter	of	degree;	there	is	always	RESTART, which	makes	most	IF	works	winnable.	Nothing	but	taste	truly	determines whether	an	interactor	will	avoid	or	actively	seek	out	Cruel	works,	and	the question	is	left	open:	at	what	point	during	the	progress	of	interaction	should	all be	revealed?	Should	all	be	revealed? </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	might	refine	the	earlier	proposal	that	being	overcome	may	be	the	sole purpose	of	code	in	IF	by	saying	that	the	simulation	state	cannot	be	merely resolved,	but	the	solution	must	be	mirrored	in	the	interactor’s	mind	and understood.	Cruelty	is	one	description	of	the	betrayal	whereby	significant	code	is not	implied,	rendering	further	interactions	with	the	system	futile.	Conversely, true	understanding	might	also	obviate	the	need	for	further	actions	against	the simulation,	as	the	purpose	of	the	work	is	fulfilled.	As	in	the	operations	of mystery,	suspense,	and	drama,	the	truth	is	obscured	in	art	in	order	that	it	may	be revealed.	As	a	medium,	the	simulator-parser	may	be	indifferent	with	respect	to the	transparency	of	its	inner	workings.	As	a	genre,	however,	revelation	is	the purpose	of	IF.	The	code	conjures	up	its	double	in	the	reflective	surface	of	the interactor’s	mind,	and	this	image	is	the	implied	code. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a>This	emphasis	on	revelation	is	an	aesthetic	ideology	specific	to	my	experience as	a	researcher	immersed	in	the	study	of	fictional	simulations	intertwined	with the	history	of	puzzles.	Rhapsodizing	about	the	beauties	of	adversity	and	its resolution	follows	a	long	tradition	in	literary	studies	of	celebrating	‘difficult’</p>
<p class="calibre1">texts,	while	also	echoing	past	IF	scholars	legitimating	their	studies	within	the context	of	literature	and	the	arts.	In	her	seminal	1985	doctoral	thesis	on Adventure,	Buckles	compares	IF	to	folktales	based	on	two	factors:	community authoring	and	circulation	practices	on	the	one	hand,	and	isomorphism	between the	interactor’s	difficult	progress	and	the	hero’s	journey	so	central	to	folk traditions	(and	their	structural	analyses)	on	the	other.	In	an	article	published	the following	year	Buckles	terms	Adventure	“oral	literature,”	a	phrase	with	even more	power	to	legitimate	extra-canonically	orphaned	works.	By	comparison,	the more	ambitious	gambit	of	Nick	Montfort’s	2003	monograph	on	IF,	Twisty	Little Passages,	is	to	legitimate	the	study	of	IF	by	first	staking	out	a	territory	for	the riddle	as	an	ancient	(and	hence	respectable)	tradition	of	literary	art	(37-63),	then framing	IF	as	the	legitimate	inheritor	of	that	tradition	by	virtue	of	its	puzzle-nature.	In	longing	for	the	relative	safety	of	literature’s	canonicity,	I	might	here make	a	related	appeal	on	the	part	of	the	difficult	codes	that	make	up	IF,	this	time to	yet	another	‘tradition’	of	artistic	difficulty	�	the	high	art	avant-garde	(that abusive	foster-mother	of	all	canonically	orphaned	works). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moving	from	utilitarianism	to	aesthetics	and	from	the	sinister	to	the benevolent,	however,	risks	decreasing	the	perceived	stake	in	analyzing	IF	code by	de-emphasizing	its	relationship	to	power	and	subsequently	political	and	moral consequences.	Lessig’s	engagement	with	code	as	a	vector	of	oppressive	policy	is deeply	consequential,	as	is	Galloway’s	engagement	with	protocol	as	a	logic	of imperialist	global	capital.	While	my	theories	of	implied	code	in	IF	are	largely neutral	(rather	than	libratory	or	oppressive),	our	exploration	of	implied	code	still runs	parallel	to	these	considerations	of	regulatory	architecture	in	two	important ways:	first	in	its	focus	on	the	gap	between	understanding	(implied	code)	and reality	(code),	and	second,	in	its	use	of	the	metaphor	of	law	to	explore	the	impact of	implied	code	on	the	individual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	being	the	result	of	abstraction,	the	implied	code	always	exists	in relation	to	the	real	(if	invisible)	code	itself;	it	is	an	approximation	or	mirror-construction	of	what	proceeds	operationally	in	software	and	hardware.	In	IF,	the interactor’s	process	of	approximation	constructs	the	implied	code	inductively, with	each	new	move	a	guess	and	each	new	response	reaffirming	or	contradicting the	mental	model.	‘Implied’	here	emphasizes	both	the	difference	of	the	mental</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a>model	from	the	actual	code	and	the	emergence	of	the	mental	model	as	a	co-construction,	half	expectations	of	the	interactor,	half	implications	of	the	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a>Implied	code	and	critical	theory IF	is	neither	the	incarnation	of	a	set	of	critical	theories,	nor	the	perfection	of	a line	of	critical	thought.	Instead,	it	is	a	genre	whose	works	will	be	more	or	less elucidated	by	appropriate	theory.	How	does	implied	code	serve	in	this	regard? </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	can	do	more	than	describe	implied	code;	we	can	also	analyze	it	or	evaluate	it as	we	might	a	reader’s	interpretation.	For	example,	we	might	ask	if	an interactor’s	implied	code	is	more	or	less	accurate,	or	if	it	is	more	or	less successfully	predictive.	How	good	is	the	interactor	at	inferring	how	her	input will	be	understood	or	processed,	or	how	good	is	she	at	predicting	the	responses? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	returns	on	such	critical	processes	might	be	poor	if	their	only	goal	was	to verify,	rate,	or	grade	interactors	based	on	the	relative	fidelity	of	their	efforts.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">“inaccuracy”	in	the	realm	of	artistic	impression	is	not	a	metric	so	much	as	it	is	a dimension	of	aesthetic	effect.	When	we	focus	on	the	aesthetics	of	the	gap between	the	code	and	its	implied	double,	a	whole	world	of	complexities	unfolds before	us:</p>
<p class="calibre1">*	Unreliable	code	that,	like	an	unreliable	narrator	in	fiction,	attests	to	its	own status,	but	is	caught	lying</p>
<p class="calibre1">*	De(con)structive	code	that,	in	the	tradition	of	disruptive	net.art,	orients	the interactor	to	a	set	of	interfaces	or	affordances,	which	are	then	disrupted	and removed</p>
<p class="calibre1">*	Imitative	code	that,	in	the	tradition	of	Turing’s	“imitation	game”	as	carried	on by	Loebner	Prize	chatbots,	uses	simple	behaviors	to	create	the	illusion	of	highly complex	ones</p>
<p class="calibre1">There	are	many	more	potential	gaps.	Purely	structural	or	media-specific approaches	to	code-based	artworks	are	best	at	describing	the	fact	of	the	code	as	a method	of	elucidating	its	mysteries.	But	implication	can	free	the	discussion	of code	aesthetics	from	the	tyranny	of	its	fact.	If	code	can	imply,	then	code	can	also lie.	Thus	code	can	be	woven	into	the	very	fabric	of	fictional	experience,	rather than	merely	undergirding	it.	In	addition	to	exploring	the	evocative	power	of code,	we	can	also	embrace	the	idea	that,	as	with	the	receptive	experiences	of many	art	forms,	artists	working	in	interactive	code	aim	to	shape	the	implied code,	and	that	this	aim	influences	their	designs. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a>If	the	authorial	hand	reaches	out	in	an	attempt	to	shape	implied	code,	it	must do	so	through	the	code	itself.	Here	we	can	revisit	the	idea	of	implication	once more	from	the	artist’s	perspective,	considering	how	the	implied	code	stands	as	a second-order	phenomenon	in	relation	to	the	primary	artistic	medium	of	code.	A useful	analogy	is	the	Russian	Formalist	distinction	(following	Victor	Shklovsky) between	sju�et	(plot)	and	fabula	(story).	The	sjuzet	is	the	direct	production	of the	author,	concretely	mediated	(in	sound,	on	paper,	via	screen	etc.),	and consisting	of	a	representation	of	events.	These	events	are	represented	in	an arbitrary	order	(for	example,	an	explicitly	non-chronological	one),	yet	the experience	of	the	sjuzet	representation	on	the	part	of	the	reader	is	itself chronological	(like	all	experiences). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fabula,	by	contrast,	is	the	indirect	construction	of	the	reader,	conceived (but	seldom	communicated)	in	relation	to	the	original	medium,	and	consisting	of a	logical	reordering	of	what	in	the	sjuzet	appeared	disordered.	Traditionally	the fabula	represents	the	imposition	of	chronological	time	on	a	story	concept	or schema	that	has	arisen	from	the	atemporal	sjuzet.	Here	the	implicit	analogy	with implied	code	finally	fails,	most	acutely	in	the	case	of	interactive	simulations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	(although	not	all)	works	of	IF,	for	example,	present	the	experience	of	the simulation	as	a	procession	of	strictly	linear	time.	Like	the	fabula,	the	implied code	performs	a	kind	of	reordering	in	order	to	recuperate	the	key	logic	of	source, yet	what	the	implied	code	attempts	to	reconstruct	are	not	chronologies	of	events, but	instead	networks	of	causality.	In	IF	these	strands	of	cause	and	effect	lead	to resolution	of	the	work.	Yet	the	play	transcript	often	attests	to	how	these	causal relationships	can	be	badly	fragmented	and	garbled	by	the	process	of	exploration and	the	relentless	plodding	of	simulated	chronology.	In	this	one	manner	implied code	is	not	the	analog	of	the	fabula,	but	rather	its	opposite	and	annihilation.	In	a reversal	of	the	classic	fabula-sjuzet	distinction,	the	implied	code	is	the interactor’s	goal-directed	process	with	the	aim	of	reconstructing	the	story	of	the work	out	of	the	ashes	of	the	mere	plot. </p>

<p class="calibre1">arbitrary	order	of	representation	logical	rendering	of	recollection When	considered	as	a	process	in	time,	the	formation	of	the	implied	code	can be	described	as	a	coming-into-understanding	�	a	process	with	significant implications	for	aesthetics	in	contemporary	IF.	Before	focusing,	however,	it	is worth	elaborating	how	the	concept	of	implied	code	is	not	inherently	specific	to interactive	fiction,	but	arises	out	of	narrative	theory	and	environmental psychology,	and	has	a	potentially	broader	application	for	discussing	issues	in interactive	new	media	art,	games	studies,	Human	Computer	Interaction	(HCI), and	software	studies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	does	it	mean	for	the	code	or	indeed	anything	to	be	implied?	A fascinating	process	in	its	own	right,	implication	is	a	subtle	shift	whereby	the mind	is	prompted	to	some	new	and	unstated	conclusion.	Lacking	overt mechanism	by	definition,	implication	still	emphasizes	the	external	prompt	that sparks	revelation.	It	is	the	sense	of	external,	involuntary	origin	that	qualitatively differentiates	this	experience	from	inference,	which	characterizes	the	same closure	as	an	internal	process	of	volitional	deduction.	Where	inferences	are taken,	implications	are	given,	and	indicate	either	parsimony	with	direct statement	or	generosity	with	secrets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	implication	model	inverts	the	commonly	emphasized	sites	and	roles	in interactive	new	media	art	and	digital	storytelling.	In	interactive	simulations	such as	IF,	“interaction”	normally	describes	a	process	during	which	the	interactor	acts to	intervene	(via	the	parser)	in	the	simulation.	While	outcomes	are	the	result	of	a negotiated	and	cyclical	communication	process,	the	simulation	or	storyworld serves	as	the	object	of	negotiation,	the	locus	of	all	outcomes,	and	the	ground against	which	the	figure	of	the	interactor	performs.	The	converse	of	the interaction-simulation	model	is	one	of	implication-cognition,	which	shifts	the primary	ground	of	discussion	from	the	simulated	space	to	the	human	mind	while emphasizing	the	experience	or	reception	of	the	work	over	its	performance	or construction.	Through	this	lens	the	work	rather	than	the	user	is	now	the	primary actor. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a>Such	a	model	of	interactive	reading	proceeding	by	implication	(subtle prompting)	is	incomplete	on	its	own,	yet	it	compliments	the	previously	described interrogation	and	exploration	(forceful	asking	and	wandering	outcry).	Narrative theory	has	long	explored	the	relationship	between	reading	as	exploration	and what	we	might	call	reading	as	implication.	Indeed,	the	question	of	how	and	to what	extent	textual	meaning	is	unilaterally	constructed	or	co-constructed	has been	central	to	the	development	of	reader	response	theories.	In	Literature	as Exploration	(1938),	one	of	the	founding	texts	of	reader	response,	Louise Rosenblatt	describes	the	literary	work	as	existing	“in	a	live-circuit	set	up between	reader	and	text”	(24)	�	a	provocative	metaphor	for	contemporary textual	theorists	with	a	more	cybernetic	bent.	For	Rosenblatt,	reading	must	be understood	experientially,	which	is	to	say	psychologically.	Her	focus	on cognition	bypasses	a	generation	of	formalist,	text-centric	reader	response. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	literary	criticism,	the	complementary	theories	to	Rosenblatt’s	reader response	exploration	have	been	the	major	theories	of	implication,	in	particular theories	of	the	implied	author	and	the	implied	reader	from	which	implied	code most	clearly	inherits	its	name.	For	Wolfgang	Iser,	the	implied	reader	is	a hypothetical	reader	(rather	than	a	real	person)	that	arises	out	of	the	structure	of the	text	and	defines	a	reading	role	that	“embodies	all	those	predispositions necessary	for	a	literary	work	to	exercise	its	effect	�	predispositions	laid	down, not	by	an	empirical	outside	reality,	but	by	the	text	itself.”	Unlike	Rosenblatt’s real	reader,	who	explores,	it	is	Iser’s	text	that	structures,	implies,	and	conditions, and	out	of	which	the	implied	reader	emerges.	“[T]he	role	offered	by	the	text	is	in no	way	an	abstraction	derived	from	a	real	reader,	but	is	rather	the	conditioning force	behind	a	particular	kind	of	tension	produced	by	the	real	reader	when	he accepts	the	role.”	Crucially,	this	offer	is	circumspect.	The	narrator	may	address the	narratee	as	‘you’	(as	in	Huckleberry	Finn,	which	opens	by	addressing	a contemporary	reader	that	probably	read	The	Adventures	of	Tom	Sawyer)	yet	this is	distinct	from	the	implied	reader,	who	is	only	indirectly	addressed	by	the implied	author. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	Booth	similarly	conceives	of	the	implied	author	as	a	“second	self” </p>
<p class="calibre1">separate	from	the	actual	historical	figure	of	the	author,	in	this	case	conditioning the	morals,	norms,	and	values	of	the	text	that	cannot	be	attributed	to	either	the narrator	or	the	real	author	(73).	As	with	the	implied	reader,	the	implied	author emerges	out	of	the	text,	and	for	this	reason	Wimsatt	and	Beardsley’s	objections regarding	what	they	term	“the	intentionally	fallacy”	do	not	arise.	Like	the implied	reader	it	is	a	role,	and	although	that	role	is	not	offered	to	the	reader	it</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a>likewise	serves	a	disciplinary	function,	delimiting	expectations	for	the	real reader	regarding	what	consciousness	outside	the	narrator	regulates	the	world	of the	story.	Like	the	implied	reader,	this	disciplinary	function	is	circumspect.	In Coming	to	Terms,	Chatman	writes,	“the	implied	author	‘says’	nothing.	Insofar	as the	implied	author	(the	text	itself)	communicates	something	different	from	what the	narrator	says,	that	meaning	must	occur	between	the	lines”	(85). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	practical	application	these	two	concepts	can	sometimes	be	hard	to distinguish	from	the	narrator	and	narratee	(respectively),	and	they	are	most useful	in	different	kinds	of	texts.	Gerald	Prince	for	example	suggests	the	implied author	is	clearest	in	the	case	of	homodiegetic	narratives	such	as	Charles Dickens’s	Great	Expectations,	while	implied	readers	are	most	useful	in	cases where	the	narratee	is	also	a	character,	as	in	Vipers’	Tangle	(A	Dictionary	of Narratology,	43).	There	is	also	a	practical	asymmetry	in	the	two	concepts	due	to their	application	to	scenes	of	reading	rather	than	writing,	for	if	both	are	roles grounded	in	and	implied	by	the	silent	structure	of	the	text,	the	implied	reader	is	a more	practical	onus	directed	towards	the	real	reader,	while	the	implied	author	is necessarily	in	absence	of	the	real	author,	and	can	hold	no	such	force	�	after	all, both	come	into	being	in	the	reader’s	mind.	Like	the	implied	author	and	the implied	reader,	the	implied	code	is	structurally	rooted	in	the	work	but	actively constructed	in	the	mind	as	part	of	an	ongoing	process.	In	non-interactive	code works,	the	implied	code	is	analogous	to	(though	not	identical	with)	the	implied author	or	programmer.	In	interactive	works,	however,	it	is	more	closely analogous	to	a	fusion	of	both	the	implied	author	and	implied	reader	�	that	is, the	proffered	role	of	interactor	and	the	delimiting	scope	of	the	system	are	part	of a	single	HCI	structure	of	interaction	design. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	the	implied	reader	of	a	novel,	an	IF	work	can	have	an	implied	interactor whose	experience,	interests,	and	interpretive	impulses	compliment	the	work.	In the	novel,	this	reader	is	“implied”	through	the	arrangement	and	comportment	of the	text	(for	example,	the	frequent	use	of	French	phrases	might	indicate	that	the implied	reader	is	expected	to	know	French).	Implications	generally	delimit knowledge	and	experience,	including	special	forms	of	knowledge	like background	or	opinions	�	perhaps	the	implied	reader	is	an	immigrant,	is	a woman,	dislikes	guns,  <i class="calibre3">etc. </i>	Implied	code	concretizes	part	of	the	implied	reader	as a	set	of	practical	experiences	�	media	literacy	in	IF,	a	set	of	known	verbs, familiarity	with	certain	kinds	of	problems,  <i class="calibre3">etc. </i>	This	is	active	knowledge,	and	the work’s	assumptions	about	them	are	crucial	because	traversal	is	in	jeopardy	if	the assumptions	fail.	Unlike	assumed	literacy	and	experience,	in	other	words,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a>implied	interactor	is	characterized	by	certain	verbs	or	actions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Like	the	implied	author	of	a	story,	an	IF	work	can	have	an	implied programmer	whose	interests	shape	the	direction	and	focus	of	what	unfolds.	Just as	the	implied	reader	becomes	concretized	as	the	implied	interactor	in	aspects	of the	code	that	afford	strategies	of	forward	motion	(verbs)	so	too	the	implied author	becomes	concretized	as	the	implied	programmer	in	aspects	of	the	code that	establish	priorities	of	attention	(nouns).	The	actual	code	anticipates	(or presumes)	the	programmer	and	interactor	in	the	possibility	space	of	code,	while the	actual	interactor	likewise	presumes,	and	her	assumptions	unravel	and	reform. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	they	become	code,	the	implied	reader	and	implied	author	collapse	into	a single	entity.	This	unified	set	of	potential	interventions	and	outcomes	forms	the possibility	space	of	the	simulation	and	are	negotiated	at	the	interface.	In	many ways,	active	engagement	with	the	reality	of	the	code	(its	disciplinary	function, for	example,	in	error	messages)	constantly	threatens	to	eclipse	the	traditional role	of	prose	in	shaping	reader	and	author	expectations	�	the	code	confirms	or denies.	This	eclipse	is	not	the	activity	of	the	work	supplanting	the	vitality	of	the author,	however.	It	is	rather	the	operation	of	the	implied	code	itself,	which	joins the	implied	verb	space	of	reading	and	noun	space	of	authorship	into	a	schemata of	connected	verbs	and	nouns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Theories	of	the	implied	reader	are	an	ongoing	conversation	in	IF	criticism.	In 1984,	Niesz	and	Holland	first	invoke	Iser’s	reader	response	and	implied	reader theories	in	service	of	correcting	a	libratory,	writerly	conception	of	IF	(among other	related	digital	text	genres)	as	inviting	the	reader	to	participate	as	coauthor: that	the	IF	does	not	emancipate,	and	that	its	implied	reader	is	not	open,	but	rather plural:	“the	text	configures	itself,	so	to	speak,	according	to	the	characteristics	of the	reader	[…]	as	far	as	literary	theory	is	concerned,	however,	this	contouring	by</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>the	computer	does	not	introduce	an	extra	stage”	(123-125).	In	1985,	Buckles	is more	interested	in	how	interaction	in	fact	proceeds	than	in	refuting	a	writerly myth,	and	agrees,	with	a	difference:	“Iser’s	model	does	not	apply	to	interactive fiction,	but	for	other	reasons	than	those	Niesz	and	Holland	suggest.”	Buckles	is the	first	to	make	a	detailed	application	of	Iser’s	gaps	(leerstellen)	to	IF,	noting that	compared	to	gaps	in	the	novel	there	two	obvious	differences	in	gaps	in	IF, which	are	1)	required:	the	gap	at	the	command	line	must	be	closed	by	typed input	to	proceed,	and	2)	explicit:	the	gap	“in	meaning”	can	only	be	closed	when the	correct	input	is	confirmed	(165-166).	Where	Niesz	and	Holland	point	out that	interactors	are	free	to	volunteer	whatever	bizarre	input	they	choose	before being	disciplined	by	the	system,	Buckles	gently	misunderstands	this	as	Niesz and	Holland	not	perceiving	that	some	inputs	are	felicitous,	while	others	are	not (a	distinction	they	in	fact	discuss).	In	reality,	because	mere	typing	closes	the	gap of	the	interface	(the	command	line),	Buckles	finds	that	the	command	line interface	gap	has	insufficient	explanatory	power	for	the	process	and	experience of	IF.	Consequently	she	refocuses	on	a	new	and	distinct	gap,	a	“gap	in	meaning” </p>
<p class="calibre1">(code),	which	is	only	closed	by	felicitous	exploration.	In	her	example,	an interactor	attempts	to	approach	the	iron	grate	which	guards	the	cavern	system	of Adventure	via	the	commands	“South”	“Go	in”	and	“Go	grate”	before	finally succeeding	with	“Go	down.”	This	last	command	closes	the	gap	in	meaning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although	Buckles	never	explicitly	labels	them,	in	her	review	and	elsewhere	she presents	three	distinct	kinds	of	gaps:	1)	Iser’s	reading-gaps,	which	are	implicitly present	in	all	text	and	closed	by	contemplation,	2)	Niesz	and	Holland’s command-gaps,	which	are	explicit	interruptions	of	the	command	line	in	the surface	of	the	text	and	closed	by	typing,	and	3)	her	own	code-gaps,	which	are potential	responses	in	the	system	that	are	only	closed	through	felicitous	input. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	his	short	1988	article	“Determining	Literariness	in	Interactive	Fiction”	Neil Randall	likewise	turns	to	Iser,	although	he	unfortunately	talks	past	Buckles	in doing	so,	citing	only	Niesz	and	Holland	and	describing	only	command	line	gaps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	her	1991	doctoral	thesis,	Sarah	Sloane	mentions	Niesz	and	Holland,	Buckles, and	Randall,	but	does	not	engage	any	of	their	ideas	on	Iser,	although	(again	like all	her	predecessors)	she	takes	Iser	up	at	great	length.	Sloane	crafts	“a synthesized	Phelan-Iser	model,”	a	general	perspective	on	both	paper	and	digital second-person	works	that	combines	an	attention	to	instabilities	in	meaning	with an	emphasis	on	the	real	as	opposed	to	ideal	reader	(27-28),	and	a	subsequent emphasis	on	reader	experience:</p>
<p class="calibre1">[G]aps	operate	on	two	opposing	levels	in	interactive	fiction:	implicit	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>explicit,	or	semantic	and	textual.	The	dissonance	between	these	two	kinds	of gaps	occur	when,	during	the	process	of	reading,	the	reader’s	questions	about	the progress	of	the	text	do	not	coincide	with	the	gap	inviting	the	reader	to	respond. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	implicit	gaps	in	the	reader’s	understanding	are	in	dissonance	with these	explicit	gaps	on	the	screen,	the	illusion	of	participation	is	ruptured,	and	the reader	is	left	unable	to	participate	satisfactorily	in	making	sense	of	the	text.	I	see this	failure	as	a	symptom	of	the	Objectivist	epistemology	underlying	all interactive	fiction.	(115-116)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sloane	identifies	two	types	of	gaps,	“implicit	/	semantic”	(reading-gaps)	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">“explicit	/	textual”	(command-gaps),	and	her	sense	of	code-gaps	is	only indistinctly	seen	in	the	second.	For	Sloane,	the	potential	for	rejection	or	failure in	IF	and	its	manifestation	in	error	messages	is	an	occasion	for	cultural	critique, as	frustrating	code	gaps	are	symptomatic	of	“an	outdated	realist	epistemology that	posits	a	univocal,	objectified	reality	and	that	ignores	the	force	of	social context	in	meaning-making	activities”	(12).	This	epistemology	is	ultimately	not an	inherent	quality	of	the	medium,	but	a	design	flaw	that	is	a	product	of	ideology (111-112).	Sloane’s	critique	of	objectivism	initiates	a	vital	conversation	(see	Ch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">3),	but	unfortunately	her	continual	confusion	of	realism	(the	claim	that	a representation	is	approximately	isomorphic	to	reality)	with	focalization (experiencing	the	work	through	a	sharply	limited	and	constrained	set	of observations)	leads	her	to	argue	against	herself,	as	when	the	“realist epistemology”	of	Blank’s	Deadline	prevents	her	from	successfully	dialing	9-1-1</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	telephone	(141).	As	an	alternative	to	realism,	her	suggestion	is	“social constructivism,”	a	design	strategy	that	would	incorporates	greater	and	greater code	complexity	to	the	point	where	IF	elements	transcend	their	frustrating limitations	in	an	ecstasy	of	mimesis	�	that	is,	realism.	For	Sloane,	the	code should	ultimately	anticipate	and	welcome	interactor	standing	points	rather	than unfolding	a	specific	and	limited	one;	code	should	not	have	to	be	implied	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	Cybertext,	Aarseth	notes	that	Iser’s	gaps	have	been	a	productively	recurrent issue	in	Niesz	and	Holland,	Buckles,	Sloane,	and	others	writing	on	IF,	but	sees	a recurring	problem	of	application:	“They	all	argue	that	the	adventure	game	has	a second	type	of	gap,	a	narrative	vacancy,	which	must	be	filled	by	the	reader	for the	‘text’	to	continue”	(110-111).	Aarseth’s	slight	mischaracterization	of	all	these second	gaps	as	‘narrative’	(not	the	term	used	by	most	of	his	sources)	signals	that he	intends	to	distance	himself	from	and	dismiss	them,	emancipating	works	of	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">“that	have	been	obscured	by	the	shadow	of	narrative	and	its	powerful	theories for	too	long.”	Aarseth	does	this	not	by	rejecting	Buckles’s	work,	but	by	building</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a>on	top	of	it	one	further	distinction	within	what	we	have	called	her	code-gaps: The	openings,	or	keyholes,	of	the	adventure	game	are	therefore	of	two different	functional	kinds:	those	that	advance	the	strategic	position	of	the	player and	those	that	don’t.	Only	the	first	are	gaps	in	the	quest	for	the	solution	of	the game,	but	on	a	‘narrative’	level	there	is	no	discernable	difference”	(111). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aarseth’s	unnamed	fourth	type	of	gap	�	what	we	will	call	“code-resolution-gaps”	�	is	really	a	subtype	of	the	code-gap	in	which	interaction	is	required	to terminate	the	simulation.	This	suits	his	methods	of	functional	analyses, emphasizing	that	some	grates	must	be	opened	in	order	to	win,	while	some	can	be opened	for	no	good	reason.	Aarseth	does	not	further	explain	how	critics	who apply	his	method	will	identify	gaps	that	“advance	the	strategic	position.”	This	is not	surprising,	as	his	rigorous-sounding	formula	invites	a	myriad	of	difficult distinctions.	Consider	for	example	a	few	potential	definitions	using	a hypothetical	Adventure-esque	IF	work:	a	chamber	with	four	identical	doors, from	which	the	interactor	is	instructed	to	escape	in	order	to	achieve	victory.	To the	north	is	an	empty	room.	To	the	south	is	an	open	shaft,	ending	the	game	in defeat.	To	the	east,	a	(functionally	useless)	mouse	is	caught	in	a	trap,	and	may	be released.	To	the	west,	a	sign	identifies	the	area	as	“Attic	Storage.”	Attempting	to go	down	from	the	chamber	discovers	a	previously	unnoticed	trapdoor	and	ends the	game	in	victory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	21.	Distinguishing	strategically	significant	gaps	in	code,	considered	as a	hypothetical	toy	IF	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Which	interactions	should	we	say	close	the	“gaps”	of	Aarseth’s	fourth	type? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	interactor	begins	a	single	move	from	victory.	Anything	except	going	down actually	worsens	(through	elaboration)	her	strategic	position,	like	a	runner sprinting	away	from	her	finish	line.	Perhaps	going	DOWN	is	the	only	code-resolution-gap	in	the	work.	One	might	practically	retort,	however,	that	going west	does	advance	the	strategic	position	of	interactor,	in	that	the	description	of the	sign	text	gives	her	an	implication	or	allusion	(not	even	a	modeled	object	or	a command	string)	that,	while	not	formally	required	by	the	signals	processed	by the	software,	is	practically	helpful	to	the	interactor:	if	this	level	is	an	attic,	egress from	attics	is	often	down.	We	can	call	this	informative	advancement.	Aarseth’s Textual	Machine	in	fact	invites	us	to	hold	a	mere	thought	on	par	with	a	system state	change,	as	it	posits	a	cybernetic	feedback	loop	in	which	the	operator participates	as	an	equal	partner	(21);	yet	in	the	application	of	his	theories	he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a>generally	retreats	from	the	cybernetic	position,	opting	to	avoid	models	and	terms that	give	theoretical	parity	to	cognition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	the	unseen	trapdoor	comes	to	be	used	is	a	cognitive-functional	process rather	than	a	purely	functional	one,	so	this	example	is	perhaps	an	argument	for the	efficacy	of	an	implied	code	approach	to	describing	IF	interaction.	Yet	are many	additional	arguments	that	we	could	make	for	the	inclusion	of	code-resolution-gaps.	Falling	down	the	open	shaft	is	a	valid	(if	presumptively undesirable)	resolution	of	the	work.	In	many	works,	a	so-called	“defeat” </p>
<p class="calibre1">condition	may	in	fact	be	more	rewarding	and	/	or	more	difficult	to	achieve	than the	so-called	“victory”	condition	(e.g.	9:05),	and	many	works	have	a	plurality	of such	conditions,	including	conditions	which	are	strongly	charged	but	not conveniently	labeled	as	victory	or	defeat	by	the	system.	Should	entering	the shaft	be	included,	as	it	is,	structurally,	a	resolution?	Or	must	we,	before identifying	code-resolution-gaps,	first	evaluate	the	worth	or	desirability	of	each potential	resolution	of	the	simulation?	We	might	evaluate	according	to	the	author who	so-labels	endings	(“You	have	won!”),	or	according	to	the	interactor,	or according	to	the	critic,	and	so	forth.	The	question	of	alternative	resolution advancement,	in	other	words,	is	whether	to	consider	resolution	as	a	formal description	of	a	terminated	simulation,	or	alternately	to	find	the	distinction	in each	work	by	first	articulating	various	ideologies	of	resolution.	Identifying	the resolution	ideology	of	a	work	seems	deceptively	simply	in	the	case	of	Adventure or	Deadline,	as	the	victory	condition	appears	to	be	itself	structurally	modeled	in code.	Yet	even	these	works	complicate	under	analysis,	and	the	general	approach and	is	complicated	still	further	by	contemporary	experimentalism,	which	often declines	to	classify	ends	in	terms	of	agon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether	or	not	we	include	the	shaft,	what	of	the	trapped	mouse	that	has	no structural	bearing	on	the	resolution?	Yet	while	the	work	may	end	identically	and without	comment,	the	mouse	is	the	primary	interesting	feature	of	the	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three	outcomes	are	possible.	1.	The	interactor	never	encounters	the	mouse.	2. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	trapped	interactor	frees	the	trapped	animal	in	the	course	of	her	escape.	3. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	interactor	abandons	the	animal.	Arguably	these	are	different	works.	If	the code	prints	the	addendum	“10	points	for	freeing	the	mouse,”	would	this	now count	as	advancing	the	strategic	position	of	the	interactor	where	it	did	not	count before,	even	though	it	is	not	formally	required	to	resolve	the	work	in	either	case? </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	other	words,	should	we	include	it	because	it	is	unambiguously	marked	as	part of	a	particular	interaction	ideology?	Enormous	amounts	of	classic	cavern	crawl code	fall	under	this	category	of	labeled-but-structurally-optional	interaction, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a>which	we	might	call	optional	advancements.	Excluding	them	from	consideration would	mean	that	our	distinction,	code-resolution-gaps,	is	a	formula	for	excluding the	majority	of	a	great	number	of	works,	both	in	how	they	were	experienced	and in	how	they	were	desired.	After	all,	the	exhaustive	drive	for	what	was	called	“the last	lousy	point”	is	perhaps	one	of	the	definitive	characteristics	of	early	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">players. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	and	perhaps	most	contentiously,	entering	the	empty	room	is	neither necessary	nor	apparently	informative.	Yet	it	remains	an	action	that	brings	the interactor	closer	to	resolution.	It	changes	the	state	of	her	mental	map,	refining her	imagined	options	for	egress	through	the	process	of	elimination.	To	extend this	argument,	an	error	message	in	response	to	going	UP	(“You	can’t	go	that way”)	could	similarly	be	part	of	this	process	of	elimination	�	even	though	the state	of	the	simulation	does	not	change	in	any	way.	Informative	advancements might	likewise	arise	out	of	interactions	that	fail	to	change	the	state	of	the simulation,	as	in	attempting	to	go	UP	(“Nope,	no	trapdoors	in	the	ceiling”).	This argument	for	the	importance	of	exclusionary	advancements,	if	accepted,	is	the rabbit-hole	down	which	the	classification	of	strategic	advancement	disappears, for	relatively	few	actions	in	our	hypothetical	example	neither	advance	the simulated	state	nor	refine	the	figure	or	ground	of	the	interactor’s	implied	code. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything	is	strategic	for	some	definition	of	strategic.	The	only	form	of Buckle’s	code-gaps	presumptively	excluded	from	this	interpretation	of	code-resolution-gaps	would	be	insignificant	repetitions	�	 <i class="calibre3">e.g. </i>	repeatedly	walking back	and	forth	between	the	chamber	and	the	empty	room,	such	that	no	new information	is	acquired	(and	in	a	work	where	the	advancement	of	time	has	no effect). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ultimately,	analysis	of	the	process	and	experience	of	code-resolution	could involve	any	configuration	of	these	outlooks	on	events	that	prompt	the	interactor (informative	advancement),	alternative	resolutions	such	as	failures	(alternative advancement),	optional	but	significant	interactions	(optional	advancement),	and exploration	of	the	possibility	space	via	the	process	of	elimination	(exclusionary advancement).	How	we	position	strategic	advancement	in	relation	to	these	terms will	them	have	significant	consequences	for	interpreting	the	gaps	in	a	given	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">work;	many	productive	positions	are	possible,	although	their	productivity	will	be in	relation	to	the	characteristics	of	specific	works.	My	purpose	is	not	to	articulate one	superior	position,	nor	simply	to	point	out	that	Aarseth	does	not	articulate one.	More	interesting	I	think	is	that	Aarseth’s	implicit,	default	position	appears to	be	that	strategic	advancement	is	a	property	of	simulation	state	rather	than	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a>combined	text-operator	loop,	that	it	is	defined	only	in	relation	to	victory	as labeled	within	the	work,	that	it	excludes	extraneous	interactions,	and	that	it especially	excludes	negative	explorations	such	as	error	messages.	This	would	be consistent	with	his	statement	that	resolution	gaps	are	not	necessarily	visible.	It would	also	be	a	reasonable	stance	to	take	towards	his	chosen	text,	Marc	Blank’s Deadline.	Yet	this	stance	and	its	distinctions	bear	almost	no	relationship	to	his actual	critical	analysis	of	that	work	(115-128).	Like	most	close	interactions	with IF,	Aarseth’s	discussion	of	Deadline	spends	the	majority	of	its	time	on	precisely those	important	features	of	the	work	that	most	definitions	of	strategic advancement	would	exclude:	error	messages	and	odd	misrecognitions,	anecdotes of	fascinating	failures	(an	unexpected	suicide,	an	unintended	murder),	and subversive	outcomes	(re-killing	the	corpse).	All	of	these	interactions	are	either extraneous	to	or	counter-indicate	victory,	and	few	clearly	occur	amidst	the	direct pursuit	of	victory.	Yet	most	of	Aarseth’s	close	interaction	resembles	actual	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">play	�	a	sequence	of	limit-testing	behaviors	and	explorations	that	together make	up	an	entertaining	and	erudite	analysis.	Importantly,	his	focus	on	limits	is not	merely	a	performance	in	service	of	enacting	genre	definition	for	a	lay,	IF-illiterate	audience.	Rather,	these	are	also	precisely	the	type	of	features remembered,	remarked,	and	reported	in	IF	histories,	interviews,	and	reviews within	the	IF-literate	community. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	all	the	critics	who	have	contemplated	implication	in	relation	to	actual works	of	IF,	Buckles	and	Aarseth	have	produced	the	most	productive	close interactions	with	IF	scenes	and	sequences,	whether	due	to	or	in	spite	of	their respective	theoretical	frameworks.	Rather	than	refining	Buckles’s	model	and building	a	theory	of	IF	focused	around	only	those	grates	that	open	to	a	purpose, I’d	instead	suggest	broadening	the	model,	if	only	slightly.	We	can	attend	to grates	that	open	as	well	as	to	those	that	do	not,	and	in	particular	to	the	tension between	the	parallel	(but	perhaps	disjunctive)	representation	of	those	grates	as action	potentials	in	the	code	and	in	the	mind.	My	position	is	that	this	is	both practical	(in	that	the	types	of	interactions	of	most	interest	will	generally	be	those implied	within	the	work	of	IF,	whatever	their	relation	to	resolution)	and productive.	For	example,	Aarseth	describes	the	following	‘rebuttal’	on	the	part	of Deadline	as	“pure	nonsense”	(116):</p>
<p class="calibre1">PLAYER:	Fingerprint	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">VOICE:	Upon	looking	over	and	dusting	the	me	you	notice	that	there	are	no good	fingerprints	to	be	found. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a>Montfort	demurs,	remarking	that	the	clearly	unintended	message	has	an accidental	sense	that	makes	it	‘felicity’	(183).	More	importantly,	however,	this exchange	is	a	potential	progression	in	the	development	of	the	interactor’s implied	code.	The	interactor	has	discerned	the	potential	to	FINGERPRINT	in	the work,	and	hazarded	that	it	is	an	act	of	collecting	biometric	information	(ink images	of	the	tips	of	fingers)	that	can	be	applied	to	people.	As	the	protagonist	is a	person,	the	interactor	directs	a	self-fingerprinting.	The	result,	however,	makes clear	as	a	byproduct	of	its	failure	that	his	utterance	was	(following	Austin) accepted	procedure	and	executed	completely,	but	not	executed	properly: fingerprinting	in	Deadline	is	in	fact	possible	and	can	be	so	directed,	but	it	is	an act	of	collecting	residual	biometric	traces	(oil	images	left	by	fingers)	that	can	be applied	to	objects,	and	while	the	protagonist	is	(apparently)	an	object	of	the	type person,	he	does	not	bear	any	residual	fingerprints	on	the	surface	of	his	person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	interactor	was	not	unreasonable	in	confusing	the	act	of	collecting	ink impressions	from	fingertips	with	the	act	of	collecting	oil	traces	from	objects,	as they	are	two	slightly	different	definitions	of	the	same	verb,	but	the	improperly executed	outcome	has	clarified	this	issue	by	demonstrating	an	unproductive dusting	rather	than	stating	“None	found.”	The	verbal	artifact	“the	me”	further seems	to	indicate	that	impersonal	objects	(the	cup,	the	table)	are	invariably expected	by	the	implied	code,	at	least	in	failure	cases.	From	this	experience	the interactor	might	further	hypothesize	that	dusting	other	persons	should	be possible,	yet	will	probably	never	be	strategically	productive.	Of	course,	this	is only	an	implication	of	how	persons,	objects,	and	fingerprinting	are	conceived	in code,	and	it	hinges	on	language	(e.g.	‘the’	generally	does	not	preceded	names	of persons).	Perhaps	we	should	try	fingerprinting	the	corpse,	just	to	be	sure…. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figuring	the	interactor:	archon,	detective,	executor Do	critical	theory	models	elucidate	the	ways	in	which	IF	code	disciplines	and shapes	interaction?	Recalling	Lessig’s	earlier	description	of	“code	as	law,”	the question	remains	as	to	code’s	stance:	liberating	collaborator	or	oppressing antagonist?	While	the	power	of	code	to	evoke	or	restrict	interaction	is	contextual with	no	predetermined	moral	valence,	we	can	go	beyond	pure	formalism	in considering	how	structural	and	legal	theories	of	code	play	out	as	tropes	in	raising the	issues	for	contemporary	IF	genre	that	currently	frame	its	affective possibilities.

<p class="calibre1">one	based	in	the	information	fetish,	the	executor,	and	the	estate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	introduction	to	Archive	Fever:	a	Freudian	impression	(1995),	Jacques Derrida	elaborates	on	the	etymology	of	the	archive	descending	from	the	Greek arkheion,	the	home	of	the	law-giver	or	archon.	In	this	home	both	the	storage	of legal	documents	and	the	authority	to	interpret	them	coincide	(2).	For	Derrida,	the complement	and	supplement	of	the	archive	is	the	death	drive.	Any	time	that archiving	is	taking	place,	it	is	against	the	death	(or	“destruction”	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">“aggression”)	drive	that	this	is	carried	out	(11).	The	death	drive	in	fact	excuses and	justifies	the	drive	to	archive	(13).	Derrida	locates	the	move	against	the	death drive	in	inscription	and	the	externalization	of	memory	into	some	form	of technology,	whether	it	be	stone,	wax	tablet,	paper,	and	so	forth,	with	a	focus beginning	in	typographic	printing	and	moving	on	to	email	(13-14,	16,	25). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digital	technology’s	continual	advancement	of	the	ability	to	externalize	memory brings	with	it	attendant	anxieties	about	the	need	to	put	into	order	(or	bring	into law)	some	kind	of	completion	which	mirrors	the	“dying-after-one’s-own-fashion”	that	Freud	described	when	he	first	explored	the	death	drive	through	the example	and	metaphor	of	salmon	swimming	upstream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Archive	Fever	is	full	of	provocative	metaphors	and	play	that	might	enrich	our discussion	of	IF.	For	example,	Derrida’s	describes	impression	as	an	unformed concept	(recalling	our	previous	discussion	of	implication)	but	also	as	the undivided	moment	when	printer	and	printed	are	joined	in	the	act	of	inscription (18),	as	a	pen	tip	makes	an	impression	on	a	surface.	While	we	may	stretch	to connect	this	image	to	the	undivided	cybernetic	moment	of	an	interactor	typing	a letter	(and	is	thus	part	of	the	symbol	system	of	the	machine),	Derrida’s	metaphor of	impression	reminds	us	that	Archive	Fever	is	ultimately	focused	on	the uncanny	connections	between	Freud	as	author	and	his	work	as	collected	and dedicated	in	an	archive	housed	in	his	former	home.	It	is	in	other	words	focused on	the	axis	that	runs	between	the	author	and	the	work,	and	in	this	sense	diverges from	our	primary	focus	on	reader	response	and	the	connection	between	the interactor	and	the	code. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	configuration	of	archon,	archive,	and	their	attendant	fever	is	paralleled	by IF’s	textual	code-work,	consisting	as	it	does	of	database	(archive),	parser (archon),	and	the	exploring,	interrogating	figure	of	the	interactor.	If	as	Lessig suggests	“code	is	law,”	and	the	work	of	IF	is	a	consignment	of	both	code (database)	and	the	authority	to	interpret	that	code	(parser),	what	does	Derrida’s</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a>psychoanalytic	model	of	‘fever’	suggest	about	the	malady	and	obsession	that drives	the	interactor? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	am	seeking	an	image	of	an	interactor	and	her	strategies	that	I	can	explore	in relation	to	IF	structures,	something	to	serve	as	an	analytical,	aesthetic,	and ethical	metaphor.	In	trying	to	suggest	a	general	figure	of	implied	interactor	for the	whole	of	contemporary	literary	IF,	I	hope	to	deduce	something	about	the implied	authors	and	programmers	of	the	genre.	Derrida’s	metaphors	initially evokes	an	anxious	and	compulsive	interactor,	one	struggling	against	the anarchivic	forces	of	amnesia,	forgetfulness,	effacement,	and	loss	that	are	the enemy	and	occasion	for	the	work.	This	reading	of	Derrida	is	deeply	appropriate to	IF,	in	which	the	gaps	of	knowledge	and	missing	answers	are	the	faithful	and terrible	antagonists	of	the	interactor’s	puzzled	drive	towards	resolution.	Most	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">works	require	recapitulation	and	recovery	of	answers	in	the	code	via	implied code.	To	the	extent	that	they	do,	such	works	stage	the	process	of	recovering	that code	/	law	as	a	kind	of	morality	play	whose	central	figure	must	always	be	the death	drive.	What	is	staged,	in	other	words,	is	archival	exegesis,	and	so	the	work in	which	the	interactor	must	take	part	could	be	termed	an	archive	drama.	This sketch	only	goes	partway,	however.	Derrida	suggests	that	the	unifying	trait	of	his theses	on	the	archive	is	historiography	(5).	While	imaging	a	theory	of	IF	code	in his	terms,	this	concept	of	history	is	at	first	hard	to	appropriate	to	IF,	for	IF	works are	generally	presented	in	the	present	tense	and	resolutely	situated	in	a	kind	of projective	relation	to	description.	Yet	historiography,	especially	in	its postmodern	formulation,	has	much	to	offer	an	aesthetic	theory	of	IF	interaction</p>
<p class="calibre1">�	in	particular	suggesting	a	role	name	and	a	motivation	for	this	emerging, archivist-like	figure	as	a	kind	of	historian	or	detective. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	“Beginning	to	Theorize	Postmodernism,”	Linda	Hutcheon	grapples	with competing	terminologies	and	theories	of	postmodernism	by	considering	a generic	trope	in	the	contemporary	novel	that	she	terms	“historiographic metafiction”:	a	generic	tope	that	subverts	generic	tropes	from	within,	whose hallmark	is	the	difficulty	readers	and	critics	have	in	classifying	it,	and	whose preoccupation	is	the	continually	emphasized	presence	of	the	past.	This	past	is always	engaged	through	a	critical	reworking,	never	a	nostalgic	return.	In	this sense	of	history-writing,	we	can	begin	to	see	an	analogy	to	the	explorations	of the	interactor	excavating	the	logic	of	the	code.	Interaction	could	be	described	as a	kind	of	reconstruction,	recreation,	or	re-performance	of	the	actions	originally imagined	in	the	code. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a>For	Hutcheon,	however,	the	reader	is	not	a	historian,	whether	archaeologist, archivist,	or	archon.	Rather,	the	guiding	metaphor	for	the	reader	is	a	detective. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	role	of	the	detective	serves	as	both	the	archetypal	protagonist	of	postmodern fiction	and	as	a	figure	for	the	reader;	we	might	say	that	the	motivations	of detective	work	are	what	the	protagonist	and	the	implied	reader	have	in	common, it	is	an	imperative	to	detect	meaning	that	joins	them.	The	detective	is	a provocative	figure	who	engages	moral	and	ethical	issues	of	loss	and	injustice,	if ambivalently,	by	the	very	fact	of	engaging	with	mysteries.	This	serves Hutcheon’s	later	models	of	both	poetics	and	politics	well,	the	more	so	because the	metaphor	of	the	implied	reader	as	detective	brings	with	it	a	lot	of	cultural baggage.	Detective	fiction	is	a	“low”	generic	trope	whose	centrality	to experimental	metafiction	serves	to	illustrate	Hutcheon’s	more	general	concepts of	trope	mixing	and	high-low	culture	subversion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Derrida’s	archive	suggests	a	model	for	IF,	while	Hutcheon’s	detective	suggests a	protagonist/interactor	figure	to	encounter	it.	The	combined	metaphor	describes a	seeking	figure	whose	task	is	to	convert	mystery	into	revelation;	not	a	bad description	of	IF	as	far	as	it	goes.	Derrida	and	Hutcheon’s	theories	harmonize particularly	well	where	they	share	a	concern	with	mortality.	While	the detective’s	case	does	not	strictly	require	a	murder	any	more	than	the	archivist’s research	requires	the	death	of	the	author,	death	is	the	presumed	and	prototypical situation	of	both	�	the	ultimate	and	irrevocable	loss	that	must	be	confronted	yet can	never	be	undone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	might	we	describe	the	archive-detective	of	IF,	an	interactor	who	works	at the	command	line	to	discover	and	execute	the	commands	implied	in	code?	I propose	here	that	the	prototypical	implied	interactor	of	new	media	metafiction	is the	executor.	The	executor	is	a	very	particular	form	of	archivist,	detective, historian,	and	law-giver	whose	charge	is	to	execute	the	will	of	the	deceased, making	manifest	the	unrealized	law	or	code	through	the	process	of	execution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Terming	this	process	‘execution’	is	its	own	homage	to	the	deconstructive psychoanalytic	theory	we	are	building	on.	To	execute	or	“carry	out”	implies	both the	revocation	of	agency	through	capital	punishment	(execution	of	the	body)	and the	legal	simulation	and	extension	of	agency	after	death	(execution	of	the	will). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crucially,	both	executions	must	take	place	within	a	legal	framework,	without which	they	become	unauthorized	�	mere	murders	or	dedications.	There	is	also	a third	sense	of	the	term	execution	particular	to	new	media,	as	execution	describes the	manner	in	which	a	sequence	of	computational	processes	such	as	a	program (or	“executable”)	is	carried	out.	This	too	is	a	form	that	must	take	place	within	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>framework	of	constraining	rules	and	regulations,	where	here	law	is	code.	At	the command	line	the	IF	interactor	takes	part	in	execution	through	a	constant process	of	interruption-continuation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	is	the	distinction	between	detective	and	executor	important	to understanding	interactive	new	media	and	code?	Both	are	charged	with understanding.	Yet,	unlike	the	detective,	whose	occasion	for	investigation	may or	may	not	be	related	to	the	desires	of	the	missing	or	deceased,	the	executor always	stands	in	relation	to	a	corpus	in	which	loss	and	law	are	superimposed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	the	interactor	at	the	command	line,	the	executor	is	directly	addressed	by	the will	and	directly	addresses	the	estate	in	return	(at	least,	in	theory).	While	the detective’s	concerns	are	the	acquisition	and	interpretation	of	evidence,	the executor	is	primarily	concerned	with	the	apportionment	and	disposition	of things.	It	is	this	objectification	of	will	and	legacy	into	the	act	of	consigning	the archive	of	the	estate	that	fits	best	with	the	structural	manipulations	of	hypertexts, MUDs,	and	works	of	interactive	fictions.	The	vital	taking	of	inventory	signifies on	the	part	of	author	and	interactor	a	shared	information	fetish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	executor	as	described	here	is	a	particular	kind	of	detective	refocused	to depict	more	clearly	the	issues	confronting	implied	readers	of	interactive	fiction, but	still	largely	overlaps	with	the	detective	role,	and	thus	it	is	no	surprise	that executors	are	already	to	be	found	amongst	the	detectives	of	canonical historiographic	metafiction.	The	exemplary	fictional	executor	is	Oedipa	Maas	of Thomas	Pynchon’s	The	Crying	of	Lot	49.	The	newly	named	executrix	struggles to	discern	and	execute	the	will	of	her	wealthy	eccentric	ex-boyfriend	Pierce Inverarity,	a	project	that	seems	to	lead	her	into	an	impossibly	expansive,	all-encompassing	conspiracy.	For	Oedipa,	the	legal,	financial,	and	social	codes	that make	up	Pierce’s	estate	seem	to	have	no	exteriority	�	she	is	always	trapped within	its	logic	and	sees	that	logic	everywhere,	in	a	Remedios	Varo	triptych	(11) or	in	the	circuit-board-like	layout	of	a	city	(13).	Her	response	to	growing alienation	and	paranoia	is	to	fetishize	information	�	a	long	winnowing	down	to a	single	object,	an	auction	lot	of	“forged”	stamps	(143)	whose	manipulation offers	the	tantalizing	possibility	of	a	final	answer.	Without	it,	both	her	status	as	a self-suspected	paranoiac	and	her	alienation	from	a	previously	held	idea	of America	threaten	to	remain	permanently	unresolved.	The	auction	lot	of	stamps	is the	key,	not	only	to	her	self,	but	also	to	the	system	of	her	world.	By	comparison, in	Vladimir	Nabokov’s	Pale	Fire	the	mad	editor	Charles	Kinbote	is	an	executor as	well,	although	the	estate	he	executes	(with	dubiously	acquired	authority) consists	solely	of	poet	John	Shade’s	final	manuscript.	Just	as	auction	lot	49</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a>becomes	a	fetish	that	symbolizes	Oedipa’s	lost	sense	of	America	and	signifies her	experience	of	a	larger	cultural	crisis	of	history,	Shade’s	manuscript	becomes an	information	fetish	for	Kinbote,	valued	for	its	potential	(under	interpretation) to	make	manifest	and	thus	justify	his	lost	nation	of	Zembla,	the	total	world-system	of	Kinbote’s	alternate	lives,	memories,	and	fantasies,	as	well	as	the coping	mechanism	that	assuages	his	alienation	as	a	U.S.	immigrant.	Whereas The	Crying	of	Lot	49	concludes	with	Oedipa	suspended	in	a	moment	of irresolution,	however,	Kinbote	ultimately	concludes	his	reading	of	the	Pale	Fire manuscript	�	and	thus	falters	and	dissolves.	For	Oedipa	the	promise	and	threat of	her	information	fetish	is	the	promise	of	a	potential	resolution	to	her	world-system	that	simultaneously	threatens	to	remain	unresolved.	For	Kinbote	these valuations	are	in	the	end	reversed,	and	the	rich	promise	of	the	liminal, suspended,	and	always-potential	world-system	of	Zembla	is	threatened	by resolution.	Regardless	of	valence,	the	information	fetish	is	this	dual	promise	and threat	of	the	transformative	power	of	resolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oedipa	and	Kinbote’s	crises	of	meaning	could	be	described	as	crises	of	self, yet	they	are	always	framed	in	terms	of	an	external,	purportedly	objective	(if ethereal)	world	view	or	historiography.	The	executor	figures	of	science	fiction form	similar	information	fetishes,	although	many	explore	the	sense	of	lost meaning	through	the	body,	especially	the	physical	fact	of	the	mind	as	irreducible remainder	of	Cartesian	mind-body	duality.	In	William	Gibson’s	Neuromancer, for	example,	the	protagonist	Case	becomes	ensnared	in	a	series	of	international intrigues	and	paramilitary	exercises	fulfilling	the	will	of	the	dead	Marie-France Tessier-Ashpool.	A	fulfillment	that	requires	he	navigate	both	the	consensual hallucination	of	global	capital	that	is	the	matrix	and	a	memory	fragment	of Marie-France,	an	unassuming	beach	scene	where	her	will	for	the	future	of humanity	was	first	conceived	as	a	sort	of	manifesto.	That	will,	whose culmination	is	the	birth	of	a	new	artificial	sentience	into	the	matrix,	can	only	be fulfilled	through	a	particular	fetish	object:	a	mechanical	bust	(173)	that	must	be accessed	with	a	key	(180)	and	then	activated	with	a	secret	word	(261).	While this	secret	word	is	perhaps	the	purest	form	of	the	information	fetish	(the	answer), the	bust	is	an	ornate	jeweled,	ostentatious,	grotesque	supplement	for	the	lack	of the	missing	visionary	Marie-France.	The	hallmark	of	executor-fictions	is	this potential	estate	of	information	instantiated	in	an	object	whose	manipulation	takes on	technical,	magical,	or	symbolic	significance	�	stamps,	index	cards,	bust,	and so	forth.	As	the	missing	answer,	the	information	fetish	must	always	be	separate from	the	subjective	self,	yet	this	separation	can	be	represented	as	an	uncanny fusion	when	the	fetish	becomes	the	protagonist’s	objectified	self.	In	both</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a>Gibson’s	short	story	Johnny	Mnemonic	and	Haruki	Murakami’s	The	Hard Boiled	Wonderland	and	the	End	of	the	World,	each	executor-protagonist	is	a specialized	technical	worker	who	deals	in	data-trafficking,	using	the	unique properties	of	their	respective	minds	to	ensure	securely	encrypted	secrets.	Each discovers	that	a	bequest	of	information	is	stored	technologically	in	his	skull,	and must	be	disposed	of	before	he	is	killed.	Living	on	borrowed	time	and	alienated from	the	contents	of	their	own	minds,	these	protagonists	become	their	own executors,	struggling	with	the	distinction	between	data,	information,	and knowledge	that	renders	their	heads	into	severable	commodities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	executor	is	a	thematic	figure	that	describes	a	kind	of	implied	interactor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	such	the	executor	is	a	generic	trope	rather	than	a	figure	who	appears	in	every IF	work.	Like	the	detective,	the	executor	is	recognizable	by	her	situation,	but also	by	her	desires	and	actions.	In	fiction	these	desires	and	actions	are	shown, but	in	IF	they	are	nascent,	and	must	be	performed	by	the	interactor	before coming	to	pass.	The	avatar	may	be	characterized	with	executor-like	goals	and desires,	and	the	implied	interactor	may	be	encouraged	and	enabled	to	behave	in an	executor-like	fashion,	but	ultimately	the	interactor	chooses	whether	to participate	in	the	exegetical	desires	of	the	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	22.	Comparing	Detective,	Archivist,	and	Executor	figures:	six	Venn diagrams. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus	far	we	have	discussed	the	idea	of	an	estate	of	information	at	some length,	both	in	relation	to	the	will	of	the	absent	(the	departed,	the	implied	author) and	as	a	collection	of	objects.	The	idea	of	the	estate	in	the	sense	of	land	and architecture	also	resonates	with	IF	more	generally.	Much	of	IF	is	constituted around	conventions	of	the	physical	manipulation	of	objects	and	the	navigation	of simulated	space;	this	is	an	undeniable	part	of	the	tradition	of	its	poetics.	While archive	fever	may	have	much	to	tell	us	about	what	the	situation	the	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">protagonist	and	interactor	are	confronted	with,	and	the	detective	/	executor	may help	us	imagine	the	implied	motivations	and	standing	point	from	which	the interactor	is	compelled	to	engage,	the	estate	is	the	what	of	that	engagement.	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">simulations	consist	of	a	wide	array	of	objects	and	environments.	They	are	often fantastic,	but	no	matter	how	outlandish	the	setting	they	usually	begin	in	and	are built	out	of	elements	of	the	everyday	and	the	familiar.	This	baseline	in	the everyday	is	exemplified	by	the	mailbox	and	small	white	house	that	provide	the opening	locale	of	Zork.	The	boarded	front	door	is	Zork’s	first	puzzle,	and	the solution	(enter	using	a	window)	gives	way	to	a	slightly	more	esoteric</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a>architectural	barrier	(a	trapdoor	under	a	rug),	which	in	turn	grades	slowly	into	a fantastic	underground	empire.	Throughout	Zork	and	many	other	works	(from works	set	in	outer	space	to	those	set	on	the	Spanish	Main)	the	pervasive language	is	of	quotidian	objects	�	doors	and	windows,	steps	and	ladders,	tables and	chairs,	shelves	and	drawers,	handles	and	buttons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here,	Gaston	Bachelard	is	the	preeminent	theorist	of	IF	aesthetics,	and	his work	in	The	Poetics	of	Space	(especially	“The	House”	3	and	“Drawers	Chests and	Wardrobes”	74)	is	perhaps	the	preeminent	statement	of	IF	aesthetics,	for	he is	concerned	with	the	way	that	the	quotidian	language	of	functional	objects	and architecture	takes	on	significance.	For	Bachelard,	structures	exist	in	relation	to and	are	approved	by	their	functionality.	Rain	is	what	makes	the	roof	good,	as	all adversities	elevate	the	necessities	that	they	inspire	(although,	like	the	bridge	over the	river,	the	same	roof	may	keep	us	from	the	sunlight	�	as	we	shall	see).	In	the functionalist	world	of	IF,	where	objects	exist	to	participate	in	action	and	create effects,	this	concept	of	emotion	and	aesthetics	attaching	to	neo-platonic functionalism	is	very	generative.	It	also	invites	us	to	examine	small	things,	from one-room	apartments	down	to	their	doors	and	lamps,	asking	ourselves	how	these things	structure	the	experience	of	story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	problem	with	the	metaphors	explored	thus	far	is	that	they	describe	the executor’s	exploration	of	the	estate	and	manifestation	of	the	will	as	if	these things	were	representations	to	be	apprehended.	Yet	the	primary	power	of	these metaphors	is	that	they	describe	modes	of	interaction.	The	joint	origin	of	the	will in	the	interactor	and	in	the	code	shapes	the	protagonist’s	resolution	of	a	mystery that	is	more	than	the	sum	of	its	quotidian	parts.	To	demonstrate	how	this	process arises	and	takes	on	its	aesthetic	character,	I	now	turn	to	an	extended	close analysis	of	a	particularly	uncanny	executor	contemplating	the	smallest	and humblest	of	estates:	Andrew	Plotkin’s	Shade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enlightening	IF:	Andrew	Plotkin’s	Shade</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	Andrew	Plotkin’s	interactive	fiction	Shade	(2000),	the	interactor	finds	the protagonist	sitting	up	late	on	the	night	before	a	trip	to	a	desert	rave.	At	first	this nondescript	traveler	is	preoccupied	by	the	tedium	of	travel	preparations	and	the stress	of	misplaced	plane	tickets.	However,	a	growing	unease	sets	in	as	the familiar	landscape	of	the	apartment	begins	to	change	�	objects	morph,	break, and	dissolve,	while	sand	appears	everywhere	in	patches,	then	piles,	then avalanches.	The	arriving	headlights	of	the	airport	taxi	wash	away	the	walls	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a>apartment	and	reveal	the	truth:	‘you’	have	already	gone	to	the	rave,	and subsequently	wandered	into	the	desert.	Dying	of	exposure	there	in	the	harsh noon	sun,	‘you’	hallucinate	this	dimly	remembered	apartment,	reliving	the	small choices	leading	up	to	the	end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	easy	to	demonstrate	the	differences	between	a	work	like	Shade	(2000)	and works	like	Adventure	(1977),	Zork	II	(1983),	Bureaucracy	(1987)	or	Jigsaw (1995).	These	prominent	past	texts	and	most	like	them	are	clearly	of	a	set	�</p>
<p class="calibre1">adventurous	in	outlook	and	with	bursts	of	frenetic	action,	expansive	in	design with	a	wide	range	of	locations	to	explore,	a	humorous	tone	that	generally	avoids taking	itself	too	seriously,	filled	with	puzzles	substantial	enough	to	take	many hours	to	complete,	and	filled	with	“Easter	eggs”	to	reward	those	playing	not	only for	victory,	but	also	for	eking	every	last	lousy	point	out	of	the	system.	By contrast	Shade	is	muted	yet	uncanny,	cramped	in	space	and	time,	minimal	and spare,	largely	lacking	puzzles	in	any	overt	sense,	with	a	short	traversal	length and	no	point	scoring	system	whatsoever.	It	is	almost	as	if	someone	had	set	out	to write	the	anti-Zork:	trading	the	trapdoor	to	a	fantastic	kingdom	beneath	a	rug	in for	a	stubborn	patch	of	sand	on	worn	tract	carpeting,	the	trophy	case	of	wonders for	some	empty	cabinetry	and	so	on. </p>

<p class="calibre1">There	is	much	to	say	about	how	Shade	differs	from	its	forbears,	but	the	place to	begin	is	perhaps	in	its	most	noticeable	continuity,	maintained	in	the	face	of	all exceptions:	the	continued	use	of	the	second	person	to	address	the	interactor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	the	second	person	mode	was	present	in	IF	from	its	first	days	as	a spelunking	simulation	environment	through	its	period	as	Tolkien-esque	folk-art on	the	mainframes	of	U.S.	college	campuses,	it	is	Infocom	whose	marketing made	the	second	person	mode	synonymous	with	embodiment	and	immersion:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Interactive	fiction	is	a	story	in	which	YOU	are	the	main	character.”	While	it sounds	as	if	the	interactor	has	been	invited	to	step	into	the	world	of	the	story,	it	is just	as	often	an	invitation	to	step	into	a	role	on	a	stage.	Rather	than	YOU	being the	main	character,	the	interactor	has	an	opportunity	to	roleplay	the	main character,	exploring	‘your’	personality	as	a	detective,	a	spy,	an	A.I.,	and	so	forth, even	while	exploring	the	environment.	There	are	many	‘you’	roles	to	explore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Infocom’s	catalog	eventually	encompassed	a	wide	variety	of	generic	tropes (including	detective	fiction,	espionage,	fantasy,	romance,	science	fiction,	and space	opera),	often	with	corresponding	characters	to	become.	This	trope</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a>explosion	in	IF	coincided	with	the	rise	of	the	graphics	card	and	a	massive	shift	in the	computer	games	marketplace.	In	advertisements,	Infocom	responded	to	the market	threat	of	graphics	by	lauding	the	rich	complexity	of	prose	(“We	draw	our graphics	from	the	limitless	imagery	of	your	imagination”)	and	deploring	the mindlessness	of	arcade	shooters	(“I	was	a	Teenage	Zombie!”).	The	company also	experimented	with	multiple	hybrid	text-graphic	forms,	yet,	like	all	text game	corporations	of	that	era,	Infocom	eventually	went	out	of	business (although	this	process	was	complex,	see	Ch.	1). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet	the	downfall	of	commercial	IF	in	the	late	1980s	crystallized	a	grassroots art	and	design	community	around	the	emerging	Usenet.	In	the	1990s,	as graphical	desktop	computing	entered	the	landmark	era	of	Windows	3.0,	Mosaic, and	Myst,	IF	experienced	a	quiet	renaissance,	with	languages,	libraries,	toolkits, and	game	files	circulating	freely	among	individual	artist-practitioners	on	a growing	number	of	groups,	websites,	and	forums,	including	rec.arts.int-fiction, the	if-archive,	and	ifMUD.	The	strong	retro	aesthetic	of	the	community	was tempered	by	an	interest	in	further	developing	the	form	and	shaped	by	the practical	necessities	of	doing	independent	and	often	single-person	development on	no	budget.	This	led	many	new	artists	to	turn	away	from	sprawling	mazes filled	with	puzzles,	and	re-conceptualize	IF	design	in	contrast	to	the	computer game	industry	as	a	craft	of	interactive	dramatic	short	fiction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	design	and	content,	Shade	is	indebted	to	the	original	era,	yet quintessentially	a	product	of	the	later	independent	scene. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Odd,	how	the	light	just	makes	your	apartment	gloomier.	Pre-dawn	darkness pools	in	the	corners	and	around	the	tops	of	walls.	Your	desk	lamp	glares	yellow, but	the	shadows	only	draw	your	eyes	and	deepen.”	�	Shade Throughout	Shade,	the	traveler	protagonist	inhabits	two	worlds.	In	the	first world,	a	vision	of	the	apartment	invites	reflection	on	choices	in	the	traveler’s former	life.	This	reflection	leads	to	the	second	world,	the	reality	of	the	desert	and of	the	traveler’s	death.	Although	a	bulb	brightly	lights	the	apartment,	it	is	also	a shadow	world	�	the	hallucination	of	a	dead	or	dying	shade.	The	question	is	not whether	death	will	happen,	as	it	has	already	happened,	but	instead	how	the	bad news	will	arrive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	window,	whose	shade	is	down,	and	the	front	door	firmly	shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your	luggage	is	piled	untidily	by	the	door.	A	potted	hyacinth	sits	beneath	the window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	are	sprawled	on	the	futon,	staring	up	into	that	gloom.	Your	eyes	feel gritty.	But	it’s	too	late	�	early	�	no	time	left	for	sleep,	anyway.	In	a	few	hours your	ride	will	arrive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	desk	are	your	to-do	list	and	a	travel	book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	drawn	shade	and	the	front	door	of	the	apartment	are	always	there,	and beyond	them	stretches	the	desert	of	the	real	and	the	realization	of	death	that	end the	story.	Yet	this	realization	must	come	slowly.	The	process	cannot	be	short-circuited	by	opening	the	door	early,	as	Plotkin’s	protagonist	is	constitutionally unwilling	to	even	look	outside	until	the	taxi	arrives.	The	“firmly	shut”	door,	the lamp	bulb	which	“glares,”	and	even	the	drawn	shade	hint	at	a	fierce immutability. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;OPEN	DOOR</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sun	hasn’t	risen;	what	light	you	have	would	just	leak	out	into	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway,	the	taxi	hasn’t	arrived,	so	there’s	nowhere	to	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;OPEN	SHADE</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>Darkness	is	already	crawling	around	the	edges	of	the	windowshade.	You	have no	desire	to	look	night	in	the	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;TURN	OFF	LAMP</p>
<p class="calibre1">You	do	not	want	the	dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These	responses	are	essentially	error	messages.	No	matter	how	many	times the	interactor	directs	the	protagonist	to	turn	off	the	lamp,	the	requested interaction	is	politely	refused,	and	the	underlying	world	model	is	not	changed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet	understanding	of	the	work	is	advanced	by	reading	these	messages,	indeed, trying	to	interact	and	failing	is	necessary,	as	their	poetic	menace	puts	much	of the	coming	experience	in	context. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	style	of	these	messages	is	particular	to	whoever	‘you’	are	supposed	to	be (“You	have	no	desire”	“You	do	not	want”).	They	represent	the	normal constraints	of	the	simulation	on	the	interactor	(“You	can’t	do	that”)	in	terms	of psychological	characterization	(“You	won’t	do	that”).	Interactor	input	serves	as id,	parser	response	as	superego,	and	the	emerging	character	is	a	negotiation between	play	and	design.	For	the	interactor,	the	psychological	error	messages naturalize	the	limits	of	the	simulation	as	merely	the	limits	of	a	personality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rather	than	being	disciplined	for	attempting	to	explore	the	unimplemented reaches	of	the	world,	the	interactor	is	invited	to	discover	the	inhibitions	(and	thus definitions)	of	a	persona.	Play	is	exploration,	but	it	is	also	autobiographical archaeology	�	holding	bits	of	‘yourself’	up	to	the	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shade	is	a	work	of	light,	as	a	narrative	and	as	a	game.	As	a	narrative,	it	tells	a story	of	enlightenment	�	in	this	case,	realizing	the	traveler’s	own	death	and understanding	the	traveler’s	complicity	in	causing	it.	As	a	game,	it	is	a simulation	defined	by	vision	and	perception.	In	IF,	scope	of	interaction	is	largely determined	by	what	the	interactor	and	protagonist	can	and	cannot	‘see.’	We	can understand	how	Plotkin	innovates	and	responds	to	the	traditional	use	of	light	in IF	by	understanding	how	originally	Crowther	translated	his	concept	of spelunking	from	a	practical	experience	into	a	simulation	suitable	for	his daughters.	In	Adventure	the	presence	of	a	light	source	was	necessary	for navigation,	manipulation	of	objects,	and	indeed	almost	any	activity.	Given	the original	context,	this	makes	sense,	as	it	is	highly	dangerous	to	wander	around cave	systems	in	the	dark.	The	introduction	of	fantasy	elements	only	increased the	importance	of	using	light	to	model	magically	glowing	objects,	fire,	and	so</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a>forth.	Widespread	reimplementation	and	later	commoditization	as	the	Zork	series left	the	primacy	of	light	firmly	embedded	in	both	the	games	and	the development	languages	and	tools.	(“It	is	dark.	You	are	likely	to	be	eaten	by	a Grue.”)	Today,	explicit	illumination	remains	integral	even	to	contemporary	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">authoring	systems	like	TADS	(‘lightsource’)	and	Inform	6	(‘has	light’),	with light	as	a	core	attribute	of	every	object.	Indeed,	an	examination	of	the	source code	of	many	contemporary	IF	can	reveal	odd	vestigial	light	code.	According	to the	Inform	Beginner’s	Guide,	“There	must	be	at	least	one	light	source	in	every room	(unless	you	want	the	player	to	be	told	that	‘It’s	pitch	dark	and	you	can’t	see a	thing’);	most	commonly,	that	light	source	is	the	room	itself”	(Firth	2002,	32). </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	example:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Object	hallway	“Hallway” </p>
<p class="calibre1">with</p>
<p class="calibre1">description	“A	twisty	little	passage	runs	north</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	bedroom	and	east	to	the	bathroom.”, </p>
<p class="calibre1">n&lt;underscore&gt;to	bedroom, </p>
<p class="calibre1">e&lt;underscore&gt;to	bathroom, </p>
<p class="calibre1">has	light; </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	source	code	defines	a	hallway	location	with	a	brief	description,	exits	to the	north	and	east	that	connect	to	other	locations,	and	light.	Note	that	this	does not	mean	that	the	hallway	contains	a	light	(like	a	lamp,	or	a	bulb).	Rather,	the hallway	object	itself	emanates	light.	If	it	didn’t,	by	default	most	IF	protagonists could	not	find	their	way	from	bedroom	to	bathroom	with	the	lights	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	illustrates	one	of	the	terrible	things	about	darkness	in	a	game.	You	can’t see	anything;	you	can	do	very	little	indeed.	All	objects	except	those	in	your inventory	are	out	of	scope,	unreachable,	as	if	non-existent.	Worse,	if	you	DROP</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	of	the	objects	your	are	carrying,	it	will	be	swallowed	by	the	dark,	never	to	be found	until	there	is	light	to	see	by.	(Firth	2002,	142) Without	vision,	there	is	no	agency.	This	may	not	seem	so	strange	unless	we consider	interacting	with	such	work	from	a	radically	different	perspective.	For</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a>example,	because	serially	displayed	text	is	highly	accessible,	the	blind	gaming community	has	long	turned	to	interactive	fiction	as	a	mainstay	of	computer entertainment.	The	irony	of	designing	such	a	medium	around	the indispensability	of	lamps	is	hard	to	miss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	Adventure,	Zork,	and	many	more	classic	IF	works,	darkness	kills	(or	at least	incapacitates).	In	Shade	this	situation	is	ironically	reversed.	The	traveler fears	the	darkness	“crawling	around	the	edges	of	the	windowshade,”	and	fears that	precious	light	will	“leak	out	into	the	night.”	Yet	here,	light	is	not	life.	Death has	already	arrived	in	the	form	of	a	light	that	cannot	be	escaped.	Other contemporary	IF	works	have	played	with	reversing	expectations	about	light	as well.	Enlightenment:	an	interactive	one-room	absurdity	by	Taro	Ogawa	uses	the standard	light	model	and	turns	the	goal	on	its	head.	An	adventurer	of	the	classic Zork	style	is	encumbered	with	an	armload	of	glowing	objects,	yet	desperately trying	to	hide,	lose,	and	break	his	plundered	riches	to	gain	a	much-needed moment	of	darkness.	Hunter	in	Darkness:	a	cave	crawl	also	by	Andrew	Plotkin, pitches	a	hunter	headlong	into	a	cave	only	moments	after	the	story	begins.	Lost and	injured,	the	interactor	must	feel	and	smell	the	way	to	freedom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	its	code,	Shade	simply	opts	out	of	light	simulation	entirely,	overriding	it	in a	single	expression:</p>
<p class="calibre1">!	Simple	light	function	which	says	everything	is	lit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[	OffersLight	i; </p>
<p class="calibre1">if	(i	==	0)</p>
<p class="calibre1">rfalse; </p>
<p class="calibre1">rtrue; </p>
<p class="calibre1">]; </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	level	of	code,	like	the	level	of	the	story,	everything	is	illuminated	�</p>
<p class="calibre1">although	at	neither	level	is	this	immediately	apparent	to	the	interactor. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a>The	source</p>
<p class="calibre1">Arguments	for	selecting	Shade	either	as	a	case	study	or	as	a	classroom example	of	IF	might	highlight	its	relatively	short	length,	the	high	quality	of	the writing,	and	the	availability	of	the	code.	The	commented	source	code	of	Shade	is in	fact	freely	downloadable	for	noncommercial	use,	and	is	extremely	edifying for	anyone	curious	about	(or	confused	by)	the	experience.	The	code	is	written	in Inform	6,	an	object-oriented,	C-like	language.	Inform	commands	and	syntax structures	were	carefully	chosen	so	that	non-programmers	can	often	read	the code	in	a	manner	similar	to	colloquial	English.	In	the	case	of	Shade,	the	code	is more	intricately	designed	(and	thus	significantly	less	readable)	than	most	IF.	Yet even	the	complexities	of	Shade	are	often	in	pursuit	of	a	simplified	interface. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	example	is	the	treatment	of	navigation.	IF	works	are	traditionally navigable	by	compass	rose	(N,	S,	E,	W),	with	objects	and	events	distributed	in space	as	an	exploration.	Shade,	by	contrast,	eschews	navigation	for	a	single location.	Subtitled	“a	one-room	game	set	in	your	apartment,”	Shade	playfully refers	to	the	phenomenon	of	“my	apartment”	pieces	in	IF.	These	are	generally learner	works	in	which	authors	new	to	the	medium	begin	by	scrupulously implementing	a	detailed	model	of	everything	within	sight	of	their	desks.	Such pieces	usually	lack	setting,	conflict,	and	/	or	plot,	tending	instead	to	concentrate on	the	detailed	execution	of	conventionally	modeled	IF	objects	�	an	interactive lamp,	cabinet,	closet,	and	so	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	as	Shade	opts	out	of	conventional	light	modeling,	it	dispenses	with conventional	spatial	navigation.	Instead,	the	kitchen,	bathroom,	and	bedroom	of the	apartment	form	one	unified	location	�	a	contiguous	“room”	with	several</p>
<p class="calibre1">“nooks”	whose	objects	are	always	in	scope.	The	interactor	location	is	indicated through	nuance	and	shifting	emphasis.	Interacting	with	something	in	the	one area	automatically	shifts	the	interactor	to	that	area,	while	the	view	is	reorganized to	describe	nearer	objects	before	those	further	away.	The	net	effect	is	a	feeling	of differentiated	space	without	rigid	underlying	zones: You	survey	your	one	small	room.	The	kitchen	alcove	has	a	refrigerator,	a	sink, a	stove,	and	barely	enough	space	to	stand	between	them.	One	wall	projects	out	to form	a	counter,	with	a	cupboard	beneath	it.	The	rest	of	the	place	is	mostly	filled by	your	futon,	and	the	computer	desk	in	the	corner.	The	bathroom	alcove	is across	from	you,	and	the	closet	next	to	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a>&gt;	TURN	OFF	COMPUTER	SCREEN</p>
<p class="calibre1">You	step	out	of	the	kitchen	nook,	and	sit	down	at	the	desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	hit	the	power	key;	the	computer	gives	a	tiny	sigh	and	shuts	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	LOOK</p>
<p class="calibre1">You	survey	your	one	small	room.	One	desk,	paper-piled,	with	a	dusty computer	shoved	to	the	side.	Your	futon,	upon	which	you	sit.	Second-hand stereo	sitting	on	a	cardboard	crate.	A	kitchen	nook	one	way	and	a	bathroom	nook the	other,	with	a	closet	to	the	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	way	in	which	Shade	simplifies	through	complicating	is	by	providing stable	references	for	series	of	objects	that	are	in	fact	the	same	Platonic	“object” </p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	code.	Such	objects	change	names	and	representations	gradually	over	time, as	with	the	hyacinth	that	morphs	into	a	cactus:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Object	-&gt;	plant	“plant” </p>
<p class="calibre1">with</p>
<p class="calibre1">name	‘pot’	‘potted’	‘plant’	‘soil’, </p>
<p class="calibre1">short&lt;underscore&gt;name	[; </p>
<p class="calibre1">switch	(self.number)	{</p>
<p class="calibre1">0:	print	“hyacinth”; </p>
<p class="calibre1">1:	print	“spider	plant”; </p>
<p class="calibre1">2:	print	“palm	plant”; </p>
<p class="calibre1">3:	print	“cactus”; </p>
<p class="calibre1">default:	print	“[BUG]”; </p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">rtrue; </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a>], </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	the	hyacinth	changes	sequentially,	another	piece	of	code	controlling	the task	list	involves	a	group	of	selectively	visible	items	that	only	“jump	out	at	you” </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	they	become	pertinent	or	available	in	the	loose	progression	of	events.	While this	subtle	effect	naturalizes	the	progression	through	the	IF,	individual	tasks disrupt	and	forestall	progressin	particular	the	bit	of	code	behind	the	missing plane	tickets:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Global	ticket&lt;underscore&gt;counter	=	0; </p>
<p class="calibre1">[	CheckTicket	obj; </p>
<p class="calibre1">if	(obj.ticket&lt;underscore&gt;search	&gt;=	2)	{</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	(obj.ticket&lt;underscore&gt;search	==	3)</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	matter	how	often	you	look,	the	plane</p>
<p class="calibre1">tickets	aren’t	there.”; </p>
<p class="calibre1">obj.ticket&lt;underscore&gt;search	=	3; </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	plane	tickets	still	aren’t	there.”; </p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">obj.ticket&lt;underscore&gt;search	=	2; </p>
<p class="calibre1">ticket&lt;underscore&gt;counter++; </p>
<p class="calibre1">if	(ticket&lt;underscore&gt;counter	&lt;	3)	{</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope.	The	tickets	aren’t	there.”; </p>
<p class="calibre1">}</p>
<p class="calibre1">Goaled(tickets); </p>
<p class="calibre1">move	tickets	to	Apartment; </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a>print&lt;underscore&gt;ret	“Nope.	The	tickets	aren’t	�	“,	(emph)	“Aha.”, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	are,	after	all.	The	tickets	slide	to	the	floor	and lie	there,	smirking	at	you.”; </p>
<p class="calibre1">]; </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	tickets	are	not	merely	hidden,	nor	hidden	randomly.	The	code	declares them	to	be	hidden	in	“the	third	hiding	spot	searched.”	Once	the	tickets	turn	up missing,	Plotkin’s	code	keeps	a	global	counter	on	the	number	of	hiding	places checked,	with	a	further	counter	for	each	individual	place	so	that	response messages	vary.	Only	once	two	of	the	appropriate	places	have	been	checked	will the	tickets	turn	up	in	the	third. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	consequences	of	this	hiding	method	is	that	the	hunt	for	the	tickets tends	to	familiarize	the	interactor	with	the	environment	by	producing	a	thorough ransacking	of	the	house.	It	also	produces	a	moderate	amount	of	frustration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finding	the	tickets	on	the	third	try	is	unlikely,	as	not	all	locations	in	the	house are	hiding	spots,	but	finding	them	on	the	first	or	second	try	is	in	fact	impossible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lost	items,	as	Shade	describes	them,	simply	take	longer	to	find.	This	shaping	of experience	is	not	evident	to	the	first-time	interactor,	however.	Only	upon replaying	Shade	and	going	immediately	to	the	previously	discovered	hiding place	(e.g.	the	jacket	in	the	closet)	will	the	interactor	find	no	tickets,	and	realize that	the	world	model	is	not	logical	and	deterministic	in	some	straightforward way.	This	discovery	on	replay	is	virtually	guaranteed,	for	unlike	randomization, the	tickets	are	defined	such	that	they	will	not	appear	wherever	the	interactor knows	them	to	be.	Using	outside	knowledge	from	the	last	traversal,	the	replayer will	go	directly	to	the	jacket	or	stack	of	papers	where	the	tickets	were	last	found, and	in	doing	so	change	(but	not	shorten)	the	story	of	the	search.	The	description approximates	the	real-world	experience	of	a	frustrating	search,	not	through	more detailed	models	of	the	hunting	ground,	but	through	a	simulation	that	requires	a similar	process.	When	the	sequence	ends,	picking	up	the	tickets	triggers	another detail	niggling	towards	revelation:	“Taken.	Something	scrapes	underfoot	as	you bend	to	pick	the	tickets	up.”	This	moment	introduces	the	small	patch	of	sand	that indicates	the	gradual	breakdown	of	illusion,	and	the	underlying	presence	of	the desert	of	the	real. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	coincidentally,	the	inability	to	trust	one’s	own	eyes	is	the	common	thread</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a>in	all	the	examples	above.	With	the	hyacinth	/	cactus,	the	interactor	learns	that the	connections	between	objects	and	their	appearances	are	complex	and	mutable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	the	illegible	task	list,	the	interactor	learns	that	attention	is	fickle,	and	that the	protagonist	will	only	perceive	what	“interests	you.”	With	the	tickets,	the interactor	learns	(if	she	replays)	that	unseen	processes	manipulate	her experience.	All	is	not	as	it	seems. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	Shade,	the	textual	aesthetics	of	light,	with	“crawling	shadows”	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">“burning	glare,”	are	communicated	directly	to	the	interactor.	The	code	aesthetics of	light,	however,	occur	at	the	disjunction	between	the	interactor’s	mental	model of	the	code	as	it	is	expected	to	be	(“If	I	LOOK	in	a	place,	an	object	is	either	there or	not,	and	if	it	is	there,	a	description	of	the	object	will	be	printed”)	and	the reality	of	the	code	as	it	actually	functions.	The	implied	code	is	wrong,	and	the virtual	light	entering	the	interactor’s	imaginary	eye	is	to	be	mistrusted,	if	for	no other	reason	than	that	the	actual	code	is	unconventional:	what	is	seen	is	not always	what	is	modeled,	and	what	is	modeled	is	not	always	seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	this	among	other	reasons,	Shade	can	be	a	frustrating	experience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Concealing	or	misrepresenting	the	simulated	world	state	seems	to	break	the fundamental	contract	between	the	parser	and	the	interactor:	the	parser	providing a	description	of	the	world,	and	the	interactor	providing	descriptions	of	actions	in that	world.	After	evidence	of	such	a	breach	of	faith,	some	interactors	may	no longer	be	interested	in	interacting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet	these	frustrations	are	to	a	certain	extent	naturalized	if	we	choose	to	either side	with	the	protagonist	against	the	illusions	of	a	deceptive	world	or	side	with the	‘real’	world	against	the	illusions	of	a	self-deceptive	protagonist.	In	either case,	there	is	a	gap	between	vision	and	the	world,	between	the	code	as	we assumed	it	was	and	the	code	as	we	discover	it	must	be.	That	gap	is	defined	by what	innovative	or	unexpected	qualities	we	encounter	in	the	code	itself,	and	one reads	/	plays	the	work	by	closing	the	gap	�	by	solving,	by	revealing,	by	coming to	understand. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a>Second	person	in	context</p>
<p class="calibre1">While	Shade	is	technically	innovative	in	a	number	of	ways,	it	is	utterly conventional	in	one	very	important	way	�	the	use	of	the	second	person	mode	of address.	Over	90%	of	the	IF	works	currently	listed	in	Baf’s	Guide	are	second person	works	(see	Ch.	4),	with	the	remainder	split	between	first	person,	third person,	and	various	text-art	experiments	or	“abuses”.	By	contrast	to	IF,	a vanishingly	small	number	of	novels	are	written	using	second	person	as	the dominant	mode,	and	most	that	do	feature	intercepted	communication	(e.g.	the epistolary	novel)	rather	than	continuous	direct	address.	In	order	to	understand IF’s	deep	entanglement	in	and	historical	co-development	with	this	highly unusual	mode,	we	need	to	consider	it	in	the	context	of	two	other	forms	of entertainment	in	which	use	of	second	person	predominates:	gamebooks	(a.k.a. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Choose	Your	Own	Adventure”	or	CYOA	books)	and	role	playing	games (RPGs).	Just	as	the	IF	work	directly	addresses	the	interactor,	the	gamebook	text directly	address	the	reader	and	the	RPG	game	master	directly	addresses	the players.	These	three	forms	are	deeply	interconnected,	and	developed	together	out of	the	same	historical	moment	and	set	of	cultural	phenomena. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	precursors	to	contemporary	gamebooks	may	have	been	the	nonfiction instructional	series	TutorText,	whose	first	volume	The	Arithmetic	of	Computers was	printed	in	1958.	Fictional	gamebooks	did	not	appear	until	1967,	when Raymond	Queneau	of	the	OuLiPo	group	published	his	short	story	“Un	conte	�</p>
<p class="calibre1">votre	fa�on.”	That	same	year	saw	the	publication	of	E.	W.	Hildick	and	Peter Barrett’s	Lucky	Les,	the	first	illustrated	children’s	gamebook,	and	the	subsequent steady	increase	in	gamebook	publication	until	over	a	decade	later	when	the Choose	Your	Own	Adventure	series	appeared	in	1979	and	“almost	single-handedly	started	the	American	gamebook	boom	of	the	eighties”	(Katz,	1998). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	as	TutorText	predated	gamebooks,	mass-market	wargaming	of	the	kind popularized	by	Charles	S.	Roberts	in	his	1952	Tactics	predated	the	ur-role playing	game	Dungeons	and	Dragons	(D&amp;D).	In	1968,	the	year	after	the publication	of	“Un	conte	�	votre	fa�on,”	wargamers	began	a	series	of experiments	with	fiction	and	fantasy	to	alleviate	growing	boredom	with historical	reenactments	and	straight	scenarios.	The	official	TSR	publication	did not	arrive,	however,	until	1974. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Like	gamebooks	and	RPGs,	IF	was	arguably	predated	by	simulation	methods that	emphasized	fact	over	fantasy	and	system	over	story,	one	example	being Terry	Winograd’s	1972	object-modeling	program	SHRDLU.	In	1975,	the	year after	D&amp;D	was	released,	IF	first	circulated	in	what	rapidly	became	a	fantastical form.

<p class="calibre1">Why	did	the	1970s	see	a	dramatic	increase	in	the	desire	for	second	person simulations,	exhibited	in	the	form	of	a	flurry	of	experimentalism	coupled	with the	rise	of	mass	audiences	for	new	game	and	fiction	genres?

<p class="calibre1">“Adventure”	and	early	RPGs	have	a	common	ancestor,	and	out	of	common communities	came	a	history	of	cross-influences.	Many	of	these	influences	weave through	MUDs,	MOOs,	and	present-day	MMORPGs.	Yet	the	proximity	of second	person	simulations	to	contemporary	computer	games	creates	the possibility	of	slippage	or	misunderstanding	in	using	the	term	‘person,’	especially</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>when	shifting	between	discussion	of	language-based	and	image-based simulations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Strangely,	the	use	of	the	term	‘person’	in	language	studies	does	not	correspond to	its	use	in	visual	studies.	Most	games	studies	discussions	use	‘person’	in	the visual	style,	corresponding	to	the	viewpoint	of	the	player.	The	first	person camera	is	the	most	immediate,	providing	a	view	from	the	eyes	of	the	avatar	with little	more	than	a	hand	of	the	avatar-self	encroaching	on	the	image.	The	third person	camera	is	more	mediated	and	distancing,	as	when	the	separate	self	of Lara	Croft	or	Master	Chief	is	displayed	on	screen	and	followed	through	the game	world	by	a	cinematic	crane	shot.	The	function	of	this	mediacy	is	complex, but	one	effect	is	that	greater	immediacy	imparts	greater	immersion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	language	simulations	such	as	IF,	gamebooks,	or	RPGs,	this	process	works differently.	Rather	than	the	process	of	simulation	occurring	as	if	from	the player’s	viewpoint,	the	simulation	is	addressed	to	the	player	from	the	simulator (“You	are	in	a	maze	of	twisty	little	passages”)	creating	complimentary	thoughts in	the	mind	of	the	player	(“I’m	in	a	maze!”).	Second	person	narration	(“You are”)	evokes	first	person	participation	(“I	am!”).	Like	the	visual	form	of	a	first person	shooter,	second	person	text	is	the	most	immediate,	with	most	of	the	“you” </p>
<p class="calibre1">(“I!”)	being	automatically	cropped	out	of	the	mental	image.	Conversely,	a	3D</p>
<p class="calibre1">game	with	a	first	person	camera	image	of	a	field	and	a	white	house	could	be described	as	an	assertion	on	the	part	of	the	simulator	in	the	second	person	mode of	address:	“You	are	standing	in	an	open	field	west	of	a	white	house….” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	both	the	textual	and	visual	case,	the	game	system	describes	an	inhabitable experience	through	assertion	(second	person)	for	the	purpose	of	the	player’s participation,	identification,	or	immersion	(first	person).	We	can	conclude	that the	“first	person	camera”	as	it	is	discussed	in	games	studies	and	the	“second person	narration”	of	RPGs	and	IF	are	not	in	fact	two	categories,	but	rather	two perspectives	on	the	same	category	of	simulated	immediacy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	immediacy	is	distinct	from	the	more	mediated	“first	person	narration,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">which	creates	much	the	same	distancing	effect	as	a	“third	person	camera.”	It does	this	in	much	the	same	way,	by	introducing	a	separate	self	into	the	frame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon	reading	“I	am	sitting	at	my	desk,”	many	IF	interactors	immediately	think (and	sometimes	type):</p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	WHO	ARE	YOU?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a>Figure	25.	In	Oliver’s	2ndPS:	second	person	shooter,	we	are	looking	out	of	the eyes	of	our	opponent	“You”	and	see	the	successful	targeting	of	our	avatar,	“Me,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">which	is	incorrectly	looking	left.	To	succeed,	we	must	turn	“Me”	right	and	fire	at the	camera	position.	In	the	two-player	version	under	development,	our	act	of targeting	will	give	our	(currently	oblivious)	opponent	like	information	to	return fire	with	“You.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	odd	category	out	in	this	typology	of	point-of-view	is	the	“second	person camera,”	a	phrase	that	only	makes	sense	in	interactive	media	and	the	only	in	the rare	cases	when	the	player	can	intentionally	switch	the	camera	to	the	first-person perspective	of	a	non-controllable	character,	as	in	Julian	Oliver’s	experimental game	2ndPS:	a	second	person	shooter	(Oliver,	2005).	As	Oliver	describes: In	this	take	on	the	2nd	Person	Perspective,	you	control	yourself	through	the eyes	of	the	bot,	but	you	do	not	control	the	bot;	your	eyes	have	effectively	been switched.	Naturally	this	makes	action	difficult	when	you	aren’t	within	the	bot’s field	of	view.	So,	both	you	and	the	bot	(or	other	player)	will	need	to	work together,	to	combat	each	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	know	of	no	equivalent	in	MUDs,	RPGS,	or	gamebooks	in	which	the descriptive	text	simulates	one	actor’s	point	of	view	while	interactor	input controls	a	different	actor.	In	IF,	this	separation	is	an	inescapable	problematic	that has	been	engaged	directly	in	a	few	experimental	IF	works	(e.g.	see	Ch.	4	on	The Beetmonger’s	Journal).	The	separation	of	focalization	from	agency	is	also	one major	topic	in	current	IF	research,	as	for	example	in	the	“nn”	prototype	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">architecture	currently	under	development	as	a	continuation	Nick	Montfort’s doctoral	thesis	Generating	Narrative	Variation	in	Interactive	Fiction	(2006).	At present,	most	IF	such	experiments	involve	a	pair	of	figures	in	a	tightly established	and	ostensibly	cooperative	arrangement:	an	archaeologist	and assistant	(Scott	Starkey’s	The	Beetmonger’s	Journal),	a	deity	and	supplicant (Tommy	Herbert’s	Bellclap).	Hypothetically,	such	an	IF	might	look	like Plotkin’s	Hunter,	In	Darkness	�	still	controlling	the	hunter,	yet	narrated	from the	point	of	view	of	the	hunted	Wumpus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	26.	In	Battletoads	(1991),	the	side-scrolling	camera	(1)	switches	to	a second	person	boss	camera	view	(2)	and	attacks	(3).	Player	avatar	Rash counterattacks	by	hurling	rocks	directly	at	the	player’s	own	perspective	(4), disrupting	the	camera	function	(5)	and	leaving	“crack”	artifacts	on	the	view	(6). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a>There	have	been	some	comparable	experiments	in	video	games	and	film	that focus	on	the	alienating	disassociation	of	perspective	from	agency.	A	much	less radical	precursor	to	Oliver’s	2ndPS	is	the	confrontation	with	a	giant	robot	that culminates	the	first	level	of	the	Rare	Ltd.	NES	console	video	game	Battletoads (1991).	Before	any	more	than	a	giant	leg	can	be	seen,	the	view	shifts	to	depict the	conflict	entirely	from	the	perspective	of	the	unseen	opponent,	a	panning camera	frame	view	whose	lens	/	screen	is	temporarily	disrupted	and	cracked	as the	avatar	Rash	hurls	rocks	directly	at	the	player’s	point	of	view.	Rather	than destabilizing	a	first	person	game,	this	move	largely	maintains	the	familiar	third person	control	scheme	of	Battletoads	as	a	conventional	platformer,	always keeping	the	avatar	in	view	and	instead	formalizing	the	constraining	role	of	the screen	frame,	which	already	functions	in	side-scroller	and	platformer	games	as an	unspoken	opponent.	The	red-shifted	screen	of	Battletoads	with	its	informatic heads-up	display	(HUD)	recalls	prior	characterizations	of	the	camera	as antagonist	in	film,  <i class="calibre3">e.g. </i>	the	targeting	HUD	of	the	Terminator	and	the	thermal-vision	HUD	of	the	Predator	in	their	respectively	titled	films	(James	Cameron, 1984;	John	McTiernan,	1987). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	27.	In	The	Terminator	(1984)	a	first	person	shot	of	the	T-101	antagonist HUD	as	it	considers	conversational	responses	to	a	man	yelling	from	behind	a closed	door,	while	in	Predator	(1987)	the	Yautija	alien	antagonist	HUD	analyzes the	voice	pattern	of	a	laughing	soldier	seen	in	thermal	image.	Both	modes	of apprehending	the	world	depict	human	language	as	a	visible	artifice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	Gaming:	essays	on	algorithmic	culture	(2006),	Alexander	Galloway considers	the	history	the	characterized	first	person	shot	in	cinema	and	its significance	to	interactive	media	and	video	games	in	“Origins	of	the	First	Person Shooter”	(39-69).	Galloway	begins	in	Edward	Branigan’s	distinction	between the	point	of	view	(POV)	shot	and	the	“perception”	shot,	a	special	kind	of	POV</p>
<p class="calibre1">shot	which	adds	some	signifier	of	mental	condition.	Renaming	this	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">“subjective	shot,”	Galloway	considers	such	shots	from	the	1947	Robert Montgomery	film	Lady	in	the	Lake	to	the	present,	with	special	attention	to	the works	of	Hitchcock.	He	notes	that	subjective	shots	are	both	extremely	rare	and usually	signify	“some	type	of	negative	vision:” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	sometimes	an	evil	vision,	or	an	inhuman	one,	or	simply	a	moment	of alienation	or	detachment	within	a	character.	Few	other	shot	styles	are	as	closely associated	with	such	a	specifically	defined	mood.	(46)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a>Galloway’s	survey	of	subjective	shots	signification	covers	mental	states	such as	intoxication,	detachments	such	as	disembodiment,	antagonisms	such	as predatory	vision,	and	cyborg	moments	including	viewpoints	we	began	with	from The	Terminator	and	Predator.	This	last	type	of	shots	he	describes	as	most successful,	as	the	informatic	display	diegetically	represents	the	uncomfortable suture	of	camera	technology	to	subjectivity,	a	suture	that	will	always	fail	to become	natural.	What	Galloway	calls	a	“technological	patina”	(56)	we	might define	more	precisely	in	terms	of	Bolter	and	Grusin’s	remediation	theory	as	the hypermediacy	of	subjectivity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	long	segue	from	textual	into	visual	subjectivity	ends	in	Galloway’s exploration	of	unusual,	unnerving,	and	largely	unpopular	hand-holding-weapon shots	in	cinema	as	compared	to	the	use	of	an	identical	visual	convention	in	the first	person	shooter	genre	as	a	pervasive	and	popular	mode	of	representing natural,	immediate,	unalienated	agency.	This	stark	contrast	is	described	but barely	explained:</p>
<p class="calibre1">As	far	as	identification	is	concerned,	film	failed	with	the	subjective	shot,	but where	film	failed,	games	succeed	(due	primarily	to	the	fact	that	games	have controllers	and	require	player	action).	(69)</p>
<p class="calibre1">For	the	purposes	of	discussing	interactivity	we	can	formulate	this	more clearly.	The	cinematic	subjective	shot	represent	perspective	necessarily	divorced from	agency,	whereas	the	first	person	video	game	shot	represents	perspective fused	with	agency.	Thus	the	same	visual	technique	in	two	different	media	has different	significance,	different	emergent	aesthetics,	different	popularity	levels, and	so	forth.	Indeed,	the	most	interesting	lesson	of	Galloway’s	historical	survey is	not	that	the	same	mode	of	representation	found	a	new	life	in	video	games,	but instead	that	in	a	real	sense	the	film	Lady	in	the	Lake	and	the	first	person	shooter Half-Life	are	not	in	any	useful	sense	the	same	mode	of	representation.	The popular	first	person	shooters	treated	by	Galloway	such	as	Wolfenstein	3D, Doom,	and	Half-Life	are	in	fact	not	meaningfully	examples	of	the	rare</p>
<p class="calibre1">“subjective”	type	he	defines	and	documents	in	film	�	this	is	an	unfortunate slippage	in	his	mislabeling	FPS	a	‘subjective’	perspective	(63).	In	these	games, what	is	the	separate	consciousness	or	who	is	the	diegetic	character	fused	with	the camera?	What	agency	disturbs	that	of	the	interactor?	There	is	no	character,	no willful	separate	self.	There	is	only	an	avatar	or	puppet,	located	(but	not	active)	in a	stance	analogous	to	what	Branigan	describes	as	the	quite	commonplace	and popular	POV	shot	in	film	�	one	that	positions	with	great	care	not	to	disrupt	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>specular	desire	of	the	audience.	The	true	video	game	analogs	to	unusual	and disquieting	moments	of	subjectivity	in	the	film	camera	are	Julian	Oliver’s unusual	and	disquieting	2ndPS	and	subjective	POV	works	such	as	Battletoads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	aesthetic	analog	is	structural	rather	than	purely	visual.	This	is	true	not	only between	film	and	game,	but	amongst	games.	While	2ndPS	and	Battletoads	are not	even	in	the	same	game	genre	(being	a	POV	shooter	and	a	side-scroller respectively),	both	introduce	a	camera	whose	subjectivity	(that	is, characterization	in	a	disturbing	otherness	from	the	active	desire	of	the	interactor or	passive	desire	of	the	audience)	places	the	sympathetic	protagonist	in	the crosshairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	summary,	simulated	immediacy	is	a	formation	with	respect	to	agency	and desire,	neither	comparable	across	apparently	parallel	grammatical	construction (first	person	game	does	not	equal	first	person	prose)	nor	comparable	across identical	visual	composition	(Terminator	POV	does	not	equal	Half-Life	POV). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead,	superficial	structural	similarities	disguise	surprisingly	profound disjunctions,	for	it	is	the	continuity	or	discontinuity	with	agency	and	desire	out of	which	strongly	parallel	aesthetics	emerge	in	overtly	dissimilar	works. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	exactly	might	we	implement	such	an	external	point	of	view	in	Shade, even	if	we	chose	to?	Whose	would	it	be?	Our	protagonist	is	the	only	‘living’</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	in	the	story	other	than	the	hyacinth	/	cactus	plant.	This	isolation	is	for	good reason;	Shade	is	a	fundamentally	introspective	and	contemplative	work.	There	is only	second	person	address…	at	least,	only	up	until	the	final	disruptive	moments of	the	text,	when	the	second	‘you’	is	finally	addressed	by	a	third:	a	person	who	is also	‘you’. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>Beyond	yourself</p>
<p class="calibre1">Although	the	interface	and	description	of	Shade	are	rigorously	constructed from	the	second	person	point	of	view,	from	the	outset	there	is	another perspective	present	in	the	room,	a	kind	of	IF	play-within-a-play	or	mise	en abyme. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Right	now,	however,	there’s	a	game	on	the	screen	�	one	of	the	text adventures,	or	interactive	fictions,	or	whatever	they	are	this	month	�	the	only kind	of	game	your	beige	antique	can	run,	anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	you-have-died	message	is	blinking	morosely	at	you.	You	started	up Ready,	Okay!	last	night,	trying	to	distract	yourself	until	morning.	But	you	can’t get	even	halfway	through	without	running	out	of	insulin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	uncanny	“you-have-died”	foreshadows	the	end	of	Shade,	and	reads	in retrospect	like	a	message	straight	from	the	subconscious	of	the	traveler.	While Shade	does	not	allow	the	protagonist	or	interactor	to	play	Ready,	Okay!,	Emily Short	convincingly	argues	in	a	Usenet	discussion	post	(2000)	that	the	description signals	a	tragedy	foretold:	“Ready,	Okay!”	is	also	the	title	of	a	conventional novel	by	IF	author	Adam	Cadre,	a	novel	which	announces	from	its	introduction that	most	of	the	high	school	cast	of	characters	will	be	dead	by	the	end	of	the book.	What’s	more,	Short	points	out	that	the	mention	of	insulin	identifies	which of	Cadre’s	characters	may	be	the	protagonist	of	Plotkin’s	IF	�	the	younger sister,	a	character	coincidentally	inclined	towards	events	like	the	desert	rave.	The traveler	may	have	been	playing	a	game	that	can’t	be	won.	Regardless,	our	story of	the	prelude	to	Shade	is	that	the	traveler	sat	down	at	an	IF	and	tried	to	pretend to	be	someone	else,	eventually	giving	up.	The	problem	of	“being	someone	else” </p>
<p class="calibre1">returns	in	the	conclusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	final	scenes	of	Shade	are	marked	by	a	tiny	scurrying	figure	hiding	at	the edge	of	the	protagonist’s	vision.	In	the	penultimate	sequence,	the	interactor	must interact-away	the	last	illusory	artifacts	of	the	traveler’s	old	life,	revealing	that	the radio,	futon,	and	so	forth	are	all	nothing	more	than	sand.	Throughout,	the	tiny figure	hides	until	there	is	nowhere	left	to	hide,	at	last	emerging	to	trudge	across the	desert. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shade	is	not	a	story	about	what	is,	but	about	how	‘you’	come	to	know	what you	know.	It	is	almost	certain	that	tiny	figure	is	‘you’	and	that	the	illusion	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>apartment	must	be	stripped	away	in	order	to	contemplate	this	self.	That	the apartment	is	an	illusion	is	reemphasized	by	the	lingering	mirror,	which	can	be	re-entered	after	most	of	the	apartment	has	been	reduced	to	sand,	restoring	the protagonist	suddenly	to	sunlit	apartment	and	creating	a	moment	of	hope	that	it was	all	just	a	bad	dream.	But	no.	The	apartment	remains	a	lie.	Worse,	it	is	a	lie that	‘you’	have	been	telling	yourself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	here	in	the	psychological	bifurcation	of	“lying	to	yourself”	that	the stability	of	the	second	person	protagonist	character,	the	traveler,	breaks	down.	If the	traveler	is	this	tiny	figure	desperately	struggling	to	hide	from	the	sand	and the	light	and	the	truth,	then	who	are	‘you’	now,	this	new	point	of	view	in	the featureless	desert,	towering	over	the	traveler	and	providing	a	third-person perspective?	Are	‘you’	a	ghost?	Nature?	Death?	There	is	nothing	left	of	the traveler’s	old	illusions	but	the	travel	book,	now	changed: The	Desert	Elemental’s	Handbook	�	you’ve	been	studying	it	for	ages.	Trace moisture	segregation,	arthropod	ecocycles,	sand	 <i class="calibre3">grit	</i> fines	sizing	distributions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And,	of	course,	the	artistic	aspects	of	heat,	time,	distance,	and	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	beginning	of	the	story	this	book	is	perhaps	most	indicative	of	the traveler’s	failure	to	prepare	properly	for	a	desert	trip.	Now	it	is	a	source	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">“tables	of	starvation,”	“chapters	on	bones,”	“a	section	on	thirst”	and	so	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	everything	fallen	before	the	protagonist’s	Midas	touch	and	dissolved	into sand,	the	only	thing	remaining	to	interact	with	is	the	tiny	figure.	The	interactor can	struggle	against	the	inevitable	logic	of	the	text,	but	the	only	remaining choice	is	not	to	play.	Playing	on,	each	touch	fells	the	wandering	figure	with fatigue	and	heatstroke.	On	the	final	touch,	the	figure	finally	lies	still	and	is buried,	only	to	return:</p>

<p class="calibre1">Implied	code	helps	us	define	how	the	experience	of	IF	interaction	occurs	as	a systematic	process,	and	it	also	helps	us	to	articulate	the	process	of	close interaction,	or	critical	engagement	with	an	interactive	work.	This	chapter considers	how	the	concept	of	a	gap	between	code	and	its	conception	can	become a	general	framework	for	considering	much	broader	issues	in	IF	as	a	genre,	and how	it	might	productively	help	us	come	to	grips	with	some	of	the	major	trends	in IF	authoring	over	the	past	three	decades	(and	those	continuing	into	the	future). </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	focus	here	is	a	set	of	IF	authoring	strategies	or	design	patterns	prevalent	in the	extant	canon	and	growing	in	prominence	during	the	contemporary	era.	These design	patterns	are	nested,	and	include:	the	recurrent	use	of	disabled	or incapacitated	protagonists	to	focalize	interaction,	the	broader	and	encompassing use	of	error	messages	to	construct	the	implied	interactor	actively	during	the course	of	exploration,	and	the	more	general	uses	of	error	and	frustration	as	a form	of	IF	aesthetics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	hypertext	fiction	after	it,	the	commercial	text	adventures	that	inaugurated the	personal	computer	game	industry	were	heralded	as	liberatory,	with	command line	interaction	billed	as	an	open-ended	alternative	to	the	novel	�	an	alternative that	promised	to	free	the	reader	from	the	confines	of	linear	authorial	intention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet	the	genre	of	IF	is	often	highly	frustrating	to	newcomers	and	to	seasoned interactors	alike,	who	experience	IF	as	a	tightly	defined	system	of	rigid constraints,	within	which	the	reader	struggles	(often	unsuccessfully)	to	read,	and is	forced	instead	into	interaction	via	interrogation.	As	suggested	both	in	a	toy exploration	of	various	kinds	of	‘gaps’	in	Ch.	2	and	while	reading	error	messages in	Shade,	implied	code	is	an	invitation	to	consider	generally	the	many	ways	in which	the	IF	experience	unfolds	across	the	gap	between	simulated	state	and	its conception	in	the	mind	of	the	interactor.	Of	the	many	kinds	of	alternative	code-gaps	to	“strategic	advancement”	suggested	in	the	previous	chapter	(informative, exclusionary,	optional,	alternative),	all	are	part	of	exploration	and	sense-making, yet	most	involve	the	deferral	or	betrayal	(sometimes	cruelly)	of	the	interactor’s desire	to	resolve	the	simulation	and	reach	a	terminal	closure.	While	errors	and failures	in	IF	exist	in	a	narrow	technical	sense,	and	the	word	‘error’	can	define such	system	events	as	the	failure	of	the	parser	to	understand	an	input,	in	a	broad experiential	sense	the	vast	majority	of	IF	interactions	might	be	termed	errors	or failures:	the	failure	of	the	interactor	to	achieve	a	preferred	resolution,	or	to	trace her	optimal	path	through	the	labyrinth,	or	to	uncover	that	“last	lousy	point”	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a>potential	experience	she	desires.	The	interactor	may	also	simply	fail	to	be	within the	work,	and	the	experience	of	this	failure	is	most	often	signified	by	the	lack	of verbs	which	the	interactor	feels	should	present	real-world	resolutions	to	the problem	at	hand	(e.g.	BRIBE	GUARD,	PROP	DOOR)	but	are	not	afforded	by the	simulated	world	of	the	author’s	code. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within	the	IF	design	community	the	frustrations	of	IF	have	been	attributed	on the	one	hand	to	the	genre’s	tradition	of	puzzles,	which	strive	to	create	difficult challenges	through	complex	formulations	of	object	relationships	in	the simulation	code,	and	on	the	other	hand	to	the	inherent	limitations	of	the command	line	interface,	in	particular	the	strategy	of	freeform	language	parsing that	leaves	open	the	continual	possibility	of	misunderstanding	and	error	on	the part	of	the	parser.	As	we	shall	see,	the	development	of	these	aesthetics	(complex simulation)	in	relation	to	these	constraints	(limited	parsing)	is	not	coincidental. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IF	frustration	in	hypertextual	and	cybertextual	context Like	designers,	critics	of	IF	continually	return	to	discussing	the	problem	of	the interactor’s	experience	of	frustration,	whether	as	a	failure	or	a	trope	of	design. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Writing	in	Digital	Fictions	(2000),	Sloane	describes	a	failure: The	frustration	that	you	the	reader	and	‘you’	in	the	text	do	not	concur	as	far	as actions	taken,	sentences	spoken,	or	choices	available	is	a	frustration compounded	by	a	parser’s	limited	understandings	of	the	reader’s	typed commands.	(82)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Murray,	conversely,	sees	a	trope:	“Zork	transmuted	the	intellectual	challenges and	frustrations	of	programming	into	a	mock-heroic	quest”	(76).	Whether insufficiency	of	design	or	strategy	of	design	(or	both),	frustration	is	a	problem for	the	critic	crafting	an	aesthetic	account	of	IF,	just	as	it	is	a	key	problematic	of the	command	line.	As	Aarseth	has	it,	the	cybertext	“puts	its	would-be	reader	at risk:	the	risk	of	rejection	[…]	trying	to	know	a	cybertext	is	an	investment	of personal	improvisation	that	can	result	in	either	intimacy	or	failure”	(4).	Rejection by	the	command	line	parser	is	unique	among	cybertextual	rejections,	however, because	the	affordances	or	possibilities	of	the	interface	are	ambiguous,	and	this fundamentally	shifts	the	nature	of	risked	failure	to	emphasize	the	state	of liminal,	unresolved	frustration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consider	a	simple	example	which	compares	two	difficult	or	frustrating</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>potential	rejections	in	hypertext	fiction	and	IF	respectively.	A	hypertext interactor	arrives	at	a	lexia	in	Michael	Joyce’s	Afternoon.	Sure	that	this	is	a significant	juncture	with	unexplored	possibilities,	the	interactor	attempts	to systematically	explore	for	available	egress	(which	the	work,	unknown	to	him, will	not	currently	allow	due	to	the	state	of	guard	fields	which	render	the	link inactive)	by	moving	his	mouse	over	each	word	of	the	lexia	and	clicking.	No click	is	productive;	therefore	he	concludes	definitively	that	the	current	state	of his	reading	denies	egress	from	that	lexia.	Returning	later	after	changing	the	state of	the	work	through	further	navigation	(such	that,	unknown	to	him,	egress	is now	possible),	he	repeats	the	clicking	process	and	this	time	discovers	(as	a systematic	search	of	the	lexia	guaranteed	he	would)	a	now-unguarded	link. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	comparison,	consider	an	IF	interactor	arriving	at	a	room	in	Emily	Short’s Metamorphoses.	The	interactor	attempts	to	systematically	explore	for	available egress	(which	the	work,	unknown	to	her,	will	not	currently	allow	due	to	the	state of	the	object	tree	which	renders	the	exit	unaddressable)	first	by	typing	her	guess at	likely	commands,	then	by	exhaustively	typing	her	concept	of	possible commands.	She	is	confronted,	however,	by	several	problems	relating	to	the nature	of	freeform	ambiguous	input.	First,	because	addressable	objects	in	the system	may	be	ambiguously	identified	(or	sometimes	not	identified)	in descriptive	text,	she	cannot	be	sure	she	has	addressed	them	all.	Her	implied	code may	lack	anything	(knowledge	or	intuition	of	a	key	verb,	the	name	of	a	secret password,	an	addressable	object	from	an	unexplored	part	of	the	work,	etc.)	that, even	were	the	system	in	an	amicable	state,	would	prevent	her	from	formulating the	proper	input.	Eventually,	she	hypothesizes	(but	cannot	fully	conclude)	that egress	is	denied,	and	moves	on.	Returning	later	after	changing	the	state	through further	interaction	(such	that,	unknown	to	her,	egress	is	now	possible)	she repeats	the	procedure	to	exhaust	all	possibilities	as	defined	in	her	implied	code, yet	still	risks	failure.	Both	the	hypertext	lexia	and	the	IF	location	are	abstractly tractable,	but	without	an	unambiguously	available,	universally	acquired,	and exhaustively	maintained	set	of	concepts	(that	is,	without	the	exorcism	of ambiguity	from	cognition),	the	IF	is	often	not	concretely	tractable.	The	IF	cannot be	merely	navigated	until	exhausted,	but	must	be	investigated	via	interrogation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	practice,	some	IF	works	do	provide	a	complete	list	of	verbs	used	in	play, and	a	few	IF	works	clearly	identify	all	addressable	objects	by	name.	In	these special	cases	the	process	of	exhaustively	exploring	an	IF	might	be	described	as topologically	similar	to	the	process	of	exhaustively	attempting	to	explore	a hypertext.	Even	in	these	special	cases,	however,	this	topological	comparison</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a>misses	both	the	quantity	of	effort	involved	(the	combinatorial	explosion, whereby	each	new	element	greatly	increases	the	possibility	space)	and	the quality	of	effort	involved	(the	requirement	to	maintain	an	accurate	mental	or physical	list	of	objects	 <i class="calibre3">locations	</i> verbs	/	 <i class="calibre3">etc. </i>	and	then	perform	that	list	through	an errorless	rendering	of	combinations	via	typing).	Even	in	this	rare	case,	the difference	in	degree	often	becomes	a	difference	in	kind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	normal	case	of	possible	ambiguity	in	IF	work,	however,	the	difference in	potential	frustration	between	Afternoon	and	Metamorphoses	is	quite	simply	a difference	in	kind.	This	difference	has	important	consequences	for	interaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Frustration	in	IF	has	often	been	commented	on,	described,	and	demonstrated	by example,	but	it	has	not	yet	been	productively	defined	in	criticism.	We	can summarize	that	difference	by	defining	frustration	at	the	command	line	as	the experiential	consequence	of	ambiguous	input.	Because	signal	processing	in	the text	is	a	cybernetic	feedback	loop	between	simulation	and	mind,	this	might	also be	restated	as	the	experiential	consequence	of	ambiguous	affordance,	assuming that	the	possible	ambiguity	on	one	side	of	the	loop	propagates	into	possible ambiguity	on	the	other	side.	Eliminating	either	the	freeform	ambiguous representation	(as	in	a	command	line	interface	to	a	chess	game)	or	the	freeform input	(as	in	an	exclusively	clickable	interface	to	the	game	Adventure)	breaks	this loop,	solving	(by	eliminating)	the	IF	genre’s	key	problematic	and	transforming	it into	not-IF	(see	Ch.	1). </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	application	of	implied	code	to	differentiating	Afternoon	and Metamorphoses	also	suggests	another	problem	in	coming	to	terms	with	one	of IF’s	constitutive	aesthetic	features:	insufficiency	of	existing	new	media typologies	to	account	for	the	processes	of	IF.	Perhaps	the	preeminent	typology	of this	kind	is	Aarseth’s	“textonomy”	(59-75),	which	systematizes	and	extends Ziegfeld’s	work	into	a	grand	project	to	locate	any	individual	work	in	a	seven-dimensional	space	of	567	“unique	media	positions”	(64).	Five	of	Aarseth’s dimensions	describe	what	we	might	term	the	topology	of	the	work:	the	set	of properties	that	define	the	possibility	space	of	states	and	how	those	states	are related.	One	dimension	is	rhetorical	(perspective),	and	one	(user	functions) attempts	to	account	for	additional	issues.	One	happy	consequence	of	this	focus on	topology	for	Aarseth	is	that	it	justifies	his	objection	to	“material	arguments	of a	peculiar	fetishist	nature”	(16),	as	materially	distinct	works	can	be	classified taxonomically	in	topologically	identical	terms.	A	key	illustration	of	this material-independence	for	Aarseth	is	that	the	digital	IF	Adventure	by	Will Crowther	and	Don	Woods	and	the	print	gamebook	The	Money	Spider	(1988)	by</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a>Robin	Waterfield	and	Wilfred	Davies	occupy	the	identical	“unique	media position”	in	the	textonomy	(68),	despite	being	respectively	computer-based	and paper-based. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The	Money	Spider	is	an	interesting	gamebook	because	it	both	branches	and has	a	mechanism	for	recording	state	that	functions	much	like	the	guard	fields	in hypertext	fiction.	When	instructed,	the	gamebook	interactor	marks	off	one	of seventy-two	numbered	registers	printed	on	a	special	page.	She	subsequently	may be	asked	to	take	the	marked	or	unmarked	state	of	a	register	into	account	while resolving	a	later	branch.	Unlike	Adventure,	The	Money	Spider	neither	displays ambiguous	affordances	nor	accepts	freeform,	potentially	ambiguous	input. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Entries	afford	their	choices	unambiguously,	by	number.	All	choices	are	made discretely,	by	number,	from	a	known	set.	Although	register-based	state	tracking is	a	form	of	computation,	comparable	to	the	software	processes	in	Adventure, Money	Spider’s	unambiguous	affordance	and	interface	means	that	none	of	the difficulties	or	strategies	discussed	above	that	strongly	characterize	IF	interaction apply	to	the	gamebook.	An	interactor	with	such	a	gamebook	can	only	choose (not	attempt	to	choose)	and	can	only	explore	alternatives	(not	question possibilities).	She	can	fail	to	achieve	a	desired	outcome,	but	she	cannot	be frustrated	in	interaction	according	to	our	technical	definition	of	frustration.	For this	reason,	not	only	the	experiential	texture	but	also	the	actual	traversal	paths	of print	gamebook	interactors	and	digital	IF	interactors	may	diverge	widely,	even</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a>when	presented	with	topologically	identical	sets	of	identical	scriptons	and textons.	The	textonomy’s	topology	of	the	work	is	insufficient	to	its	purpose,	in other	words,	like	a	map	that	omits	one-way	streets	or	natural	barriers	and	thus has	no	predictive	power	to	describe	navigating	the	territory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	generalizing	this	critique	from	the	textonomy	to	media	theory	more generally,	we	should	take	head-on	Aarseth’s	recurrent	disclaimer	that	the textonomy	is	an	approach	rather	than	the	sum	of	its	parts:	“If	the	model	should be	shown	to	contain	errors	(such	as	misreadings,	inconsistencies,	or idiosyncrasies)	that	render	it	unacceptable,	a	better	model	can	be	constructed	and displayed	following	the	same	principles”	(65).	This	would	suggest	that	we	might add	a	new	valence	to	the	User	Function,	such	as	a	distinct	“User	Disambiguation Function	(DF),”	or	else	add	a	new	column	to	the	whole,	such	as	“Ambiguity,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">which	would	then	enable	a	better	textonomy	of	1152	unique	media	positions	that could	in	turn	accommodate	the	constitutive	difference	of	frustration	between these	two	otherwise	similar	works. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	difficulty	of	accommodating	implied	code	and	all	its	consequences	into the	textonomy,	however,	is	not	the	omission	of	a	particular	feature	specific	to command	line	works,	nor	a	specificity	problem	with	a	particular	category. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rather,	it	is	symptomatic	of	a	pervasive	lack	in	the	interlocking	theoretical structures	of	Cybertext.	In	spite	of	itself	the	theory	systematically	retreats	from accounts	of	cognition,	which	in	its	terms	should	be	descriptions	of	signal processing	in	the	“operator”	component	of	the	textual	machine.	Without	these accounts	it	is	not	in	fact	a	cybernetic	theory,	but	only	a	partial	mapping	of	the feedback	loop.	Its	formalisms	are	not	of	interaction	as	a	process,	but	of interactive	potentials	independent	of	affordances	or	their	apprehension.	This	is endemic	to	the	model	of	formalism	as	conceived	in	Cybertext	and	cannot	be easily	supplemented	away.	For	example,	the	gamebook	The	Money	Spider	is described	as	“controlled”:	like	Afternoon	or	Adventure,	a	location,	lexia,	or	state must	be	achieved	in	order	to	give	access	to	another	state.	In	Afternoon	and Adventure	this	coincides	with	a	particular	system	of	interface	(mouse	click	or command	line)	and	initial	knowledge	of	the	system	(hidden	behind	the interface).	In	The	Money	Spider,	however,	this	coincides	with	the	material reality	of	the	codex,	which	remains	a	direct	random-access	medium	despite	the control	topology	specified	within	its	pages.	The	thin	volume	affords	easy	access to	an	interactor	wishing	to	scan	its	easily	known	number	of	lexias	(there	are 280),	and	turning	the	pages	presents	constant	potential	distractions,	perhaps seducing	an	interactor	into	exploring	some	alternative	glimpsed	on	the	way	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>her	appointed	number.	The	codex	form	also	presents	a	high	likelihood	of interesting	misfires	when	a	scrupulous	interactor	merely	mistakes	her	appointed number	for	another.	In	truly	cybernetic	terms,	these	are	formal	properties	of	the textual	machine,	as	at	each	choice	operation	the	textual	machine	of	a	gamebook must	transfer	a	number	from	stable	long-term	memory	(the	page)	into	unstable short-term	memory	(the	mind)	and	then	through	a	stored	program	(literacy) initiate	a	scanning	process	(flipping	pages)	in	which	each	page	number	is compared	to	the	remembered	(or	thumbed)	number,	until	a	match	is	found…	so long	as	nothing	goes	wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gamebook	authors,	of	course,	are	all	too	aware	that	something	often	goes wrong.	Most	artful	gamebooks	in	fact	make	a	point	of	acknowledging	that process	as	part	of	their	design.	Kim	Newman’s	Life’s	Lottery	(1999),	for example,	includes:</p>
<p class="calibre1">*	Directions	that	expose	the	interactor	to	risk	of	distraction (e.g.	“Read	18,	go	to	24”	or	“Read	13,	then	come	back	here”). </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	Directions	that	are	required	rhetorically,  <i class="calibre3">i.e. </i>	ones	the	author	knows	the interactor	will	almost	certainly	not	perform	(“Find	a	pack	of	cards.	Take	a	card	at random.	Replace,	shuffle	well,	draw	again.	If	you	got	the	Queen	of	Spades	twice in	a	row,	you	are	born	dead.	Go	to	0”). </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	Floating	lexias	not	formally	reachable	from	any	path,	including	ones	that congratulate	or	berate	the	interactor	for	transgressing	the	rules. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	A	technically	or	formally	unreachable	path	of	lexias	that	form	a	closed	eternal loop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Topologically,	these	last	two	examples	are	simple	to	describe	in	Cybertext terms:	they	are	textons	that	are	controlled	in	such	a	way	that	they	are unreachable.	Yet	these	textons	are	routinely	commented	on	by	delighted interactors,	and	so	must	be	routinely	reached,	suggesting	that	describing	a gamebook	as	controlled	has	not	prepared	us	to	understand	the	work	or	how	it	is traversed,	but	has	instead	obscured	the	process	of	traversal	behind	a	metaphor,	as if	control	were	formal	and	objective	rather	than	processual	and	negotiated. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Not	only	is	this	metaphor	insufficiently	descriptive	of	interaction	for	the purposes	of	criticism,	it	also	cannot	account	for	the	design	decisions	of	real artists	who	are	attempting	to	anticipate	and	afford	real	interaction.	Newman’s work	invites	the	interactor	to	build	up	quite	complex	ideas	of	what	a	gamebook is,	and	then	plays	with	various	attempted	circumventions.	Yet	his	authorial decision	to	create	formally	unreachable	lexias	is	inexplicable	in	the	context	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘control’	conceived	as	part	of	an	ergodics	innate	in	the	work	itself.	It	can	only make	sense	if	control	is	the	process	of	a	total	textual	machine	including	the interactor,	her	literacy,	and	her	implied	code.	Most	categories	of	the	textonomy are	subject	to	similar	critique;	they	are	superficially	descriptive,	but	critically unproductive	where	they	exclude	cognition,	which	cannot	be	quarantined	in	a single	“user	function”	nor	attached	to	the	object	as	a	formally	described interface.	This	cannot	account	for	the	process	of	interaction	or	for	the	authoring practices	that	shape	and	anticipate	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	study	owes	much	to	Aarseth’s	work,	and	the	approaches	closest	and dearest	to	our	own	sometimes	evoke	our	harshest	critiques.	The	Cybertext textonomy	is	a	useful	provocation	for	contemplating	new	media	formalism.	Yet it	is	fundamentally	incomplete	in	a	way	that	makes	it	systematically	and predictably	insufficient	to	account	for	the	way	interaction	occurs.	The	textonomy approach	cannot	provide,	in	other	words,	“the	playing	ground	of	textology	(the study	of	textual	meaning)”	(15)	that	it	aspires	to,	whether	on	paper	or	on	the screen,	because	it	will	provide	as	a	foundation	accounts	which	must	first	be questioned	and	undone	(rather	than	supplemented)	before	proceeding.	In	order	to examine	frustration,	we	must	recover	the	realities	of	interactive	feedback	loops from	behind	the	metaphors	of	systems,	and	begin	in	the	fact	of	interaction	as	a process	and	an	experience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IF	aesthetics	in	critical	theory:	frustrating	art Despite	the	lack	of	contemporary	critical	consensus	on	either	terms	or	a framework	for	discussing	frustration,	frustration	has	been	a	central	concern	�</p>
<p class="calibre1">perhaps	the	central	aesthetic	concern	�	in	the	history	of	IF	criticism.	As outlined	in	Ch.	2,	IF	critics	since	1984	have	returned	repeatedly	to	the	figure	of	a gap	in	the	IF	work.	In	their	analyses	of	interaction	they	have	located	these	gaps variously	between	text	and	mind,	between	text	and	command	line,	between command	and	code,	and	so	forth,	although	there	have	been	scarce	productive</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a>applications	of	these	disparate	gaps	in	specific	analyses	or	close	interactions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	is	at	stake	in	this	ongoing	discussion	is	not	just	a	preferred	theoretical apparatus	for	close	interacting,	but	rather	a	larger	question	about	the	aesthetics and	ethics	of	IF	�	how	IF	is	experienced,	how	it	should	be	experienced,	and what	trends	have	characterized	work	in	the	genre	as	it	has	emerged	into	itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet	the	critical	conversation	about	IF’s	evolving	essence	and	characteristic aesthetics	has	remained	nascent	and	inchoate.	This	is	not	simply	due	to	minor disorientations	over	the	frequent	re-application	of	Iser	to	different	aspects	of	the same	problem	space.	One	cause	for	this	incoherence	has	been	widespread misinformation	on	the	early	history	of	IF,	coupled	with	the	widespread	neglect	of its	more	recent	history	(Ch.	1).	The	more	fundamental	problem	has	been scholars’	lack	of	engagement	with	the	wide	diversity	found	even	within	the approximately	fifty	best-known	works	of	the	commercial	period.	Instead,	the majority	of	IF	scholarly	analyses	have	been	limited	to	the	works	Adventure, Zork,	and	Deadline.	This	limitation	has	necessarily	made	the	extension	of	such analyses	to	general	theories	of	the	IF	genre	per	se	both	tentative	and	consistently skewed.	I’d	like	to	recapitulate	that	critical	history	one	more	time,	however,	with the	purpose	of	evoking	this	tentative	conversation	on	the	past,	present,	and	future of	the	genre’s	aesthetics,	which	I	would	characterize	as	a	debate	about	the	ethical stance	and	effect	of	the	gap	itself	on	interaction	�	that	is,	a	debate	over frustration	aesthetics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Writing	in	1984	Niesz	and	Holland	mention	Blank’s	Deadline	in	passing	but spend	the	majority	of	their	time	on	a	now-obscure	work	by	Robert	Lafore,	His Majesty’s	Ship	Impetuous	(1980).	Niesz	and	Holland	suggest	a	bright	but unknowable	future	for	digital	textuality	generally: What	the	genre	might	look	like	in	two	decades,	it	seems	impossible	to	say, given	the	rate	of	technological	change.	As	we	write,	for	example,	the	genre	is advancing	yet	another	technological	step.	Nationwide	computer	networks connected	by	telephone	now	maintain	programs	called	“electronic	novels.	(126) In	1985	Buckles	considers	Adventure	in	great	depth,	and	sees	IF-proper	as based	in	deep	ethical	structure	(the	scientific	method).	The	potential	in	this	is indicated	by	IF	works	increasingly	emulating	the	tropes	of	mystery	and	science fiction	literature,	a	trend	likely	to	produce	“works	of	high	artistic	value”: I	believe	this	will	be	achieved	when	authors	learn	to	use	its	feedback</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>mechanism	for	the	subtle	control	of	readers’	thought	processes,	and	especially when	the	contemplative,	reflective	qualities	inherent	in	the	medium	are artistically	exploited	as	the	central	literary	experience.	(187-188) In	1989	Randall	argues	that	such	high-art	IF	works	have	in	fact	already	been produced,	citing	examples	of	unreliable	narrators	and	challenging	prose	drawn primarily	from	a	variety	of	high-concept	commercial	IF,	particularly	works	from the	Br�derbund-Synapse	“Electronic	Novels”	catalog	such	as	Robert	Pinsky’s Mindwheel.	He	uses	Victor	Shklovsky’s	ostranenie	(defamiliarization,	more literally	‘estrangement’)	to	argue	that	IF	in	its	strangeness	is	necessarily	artful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	argument	exemplifies	one	ongoing	tradition	in	IF	criticism	of	turning	to Russian	Formalists,	and	another	ongoing	tradition	of	proposing	an	aesthetics	of difficulty	for	IF.	Randall’s	examples	are	largely	works	published	in	1985-1986,	a fact	which	makes	his	brief	collection	of	readings	the	most	‘contemporary’	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">analysis	published	in	academia	for	well	over	a	decade	to	come.	For	Randall, frustration	in	IF	arises	out	of	a	set	of	game	design	traditions	that	the	more	artful works	are	abandoning:</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	early	interactive	fiction,	the	hurdles	themselves	provided	the	basis	for	the quest;	to	solve	the	quest	the	reader	was	forced	to	solve	puzzle	after	frustrating puzzle.	Recent	works,	though,	such	as	those	chosen	for	this	article,	do	not usually	allow	a	hurdle	to	stand	between	the	reader	and	the	completion	of	the text,	because	to	do	so	would	be	to	deny	the	traditional	reading	experience,	the anticipation	of	the	final	page.	As	interactive	fiction	turns	away	from	its	origins	in gaming	and	tries	to	attain	some	degree	of	literary	stature,	it	has	begun	a	process of	considering	the	role	of	the	new	technology	in	the	traditional	relationships between	the	reader	[…]	and	the	literary	text.	(184) In	1991	Sloane	demurs	that	IF	works	are	not	in	fact	artful	yet,	arguing	based primarily	on	the	strength	of	an	extended	reading	of	Deadline	(1982)	that	extant works	are	oppressively	frustrating	and	hence	woefully	inadequate.	IF	software models	are	based	on	what	Sloane	terms	“the	Objectivist	Paradigm”	(111)	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Objectivism,”	which	she	describes	as	an	antagonistic	and	inferior	philosophy	to her	own	“social	constructionism.”	This	understanding	is	grounded	in	debates from	the	fields	of	cognitive	science	and	composition:	if	Objectivism	is	an	over-simple	account	of	the	mind,	it	leads	to	an	over-simple	account	of	writing,	and has	manifested	itself	in	IF	as	an	over-simple	affordance	of	interaction.	To	the extent	that	Oz	Project	prototypes	and	other	examples	are	more	complex	than Deadline,	Sloane	finds	they	are	implicitly	critiquing	Objectivism	(112),	but	these</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>critiques	too	are	finally	insufficient.	Yet	Sloane	holds	out	hope	for	the	future,	and in	fact	suggests	a	fairly	concrete	research	and	development	program	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">“deeper,	subjective	narratives”	in	which	programmers	and	writers	avoid</p>
<p class="calibre1">“codifying	their	own	visions	of	the	world	in	their	stories”	and	work	instead	to craft	more	complex	worlds	and	characters	(183-185).	Because	Sloane	considers the	flawed	designs	of	IF	to	be	distinct	from	the	medium	of	IF,	she	further recommends	that	future	authors	“explore	this	medium’s	bestimmt	and unbestimmt,	in	Chatman’s	terms;	I	suggest	looking	for	what	the	layered plasticity	of	this	medium	will	support	that	other	media	will	not”	(185).	This	is	a compelling	charge,	and	such	exploration	has	in	fact	been	taken	up,	although perhaps	not	in	the	ways	or	with	the	results	Sloane	might	have	expected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	1997	Janet	Murray	marks	the	death	of	Floyd	in	Meretzky’s	Planetfall (1983)	as	a	“minor	milestone	on	the	road	from	puzzle	gaming	to	expressive narrative	art.	It	demonstrates	that	the	potential	for	compelling	computer	stories does	not	depend	on	high-tech	animation	or	expensively	produced	video	footage but	on	a	shaping	of	such	dramatic	moments”	(Hamlet	on	the	Holodeck,	52-53). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	insights	into	the	design	are	acute,	and	she	identifies	a	design	pattern	with implications	for	future	work:</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lesson	in	Zork	is	that	the	first	step	in	making	an	enticing	narrative	world is	to	script	the	interactor.	[…]	The	fantasy	environment	provided	the	interactor with	a	familiar	role	and	made	it	possible	for	the	programmers	to	anticipate	the interactor’s	behaviors.	By	using	these	literary	and	gaming	conventions	to constrain	the	players’	behaviors	to	a	dramatically	appropriate	but	limited	set	of commands,	the	designers	could	focus	their	inventive	powers	on	making	the virtual	world	as	responsive	as	possible	to	every	possible	combination	of commands.	(79)</p>
<p class="calibre1">While	Murray’s	emphasis	on	the	necessity	of	structuring	constraint	(106) directly	contradicts	Sloane,	Murray	echoes	Sloane	in	describing	the	future challenge:	adapt	this	formula	to	“a	wider	range	of	behavior	than	treasure	hunting and	troll	slaughter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Also	in	1997	Aarseth	offers	a	fierce	correction	of	the	inaccurate	or	absent historical	view	of	IF	present	in	most	previous	criticism,	observing	that	“while critics	apply	or	suggest	literary	perspectives,	they	do	not	always	treat	adventure games	as	they	would	a	literary	work”	(107).	His	historical	sketch	is	fairly	solid, but	naming	the	problem	and	indicating	future	work	to	be	done	is	the	true</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a>breakthrough.	Aarseth	surmises	that	the	noncommercial	origins	of	Adventure may	have	obscured	it	from	critical	view	(108),	yet	his	own	thoughts	on	the potential	of	IF	as	an	“underrated	aesthetic	genre”	strangely	hinge	on	his	doubts that	it	may	ever	be	revived	“as	a	commercial	genre.”	Aarseth	primarily	follows Buckles	in	approach	and	theoretical	framework,	but	he	echoes	Sloane	both	in focusing	again	on	Deadline	(1982)	and	in	primarily	discussing	the	many frustrating	inadequacies	of	that	work	�	an	extended	close	interaction	that	he memorably	dubs	“The	Autistic	Detective	Agency”	(115).	While	omitting mention	of	contemporary	work,	Aarseth’s	general	grasp	of	1980s	works	is reflected	in	his	useful	abstract	diagram	of	IF	software	architecture	“A Generalized,	RolePlaying	Cybertext.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	2000	release	of	Sloane’s	Digital	Fictions	represents	and	expands	both	her dissertation	findings	on	Deadline	(1982)	and	her	condemnation	of	its	frustrating elements,	with	some	rejoinder	to	Aarseth’s	cybertext,	in	particular	that	his generalized	roleplaying	cybertext	diagram	is	a	formula	for	Objectivist	design (73).	Sloane	does	not	take	on	more	recent	works	in	her	reprise,	which	is unfortunate	given	that	many	IF	other	than	Deadline	exist	which	explore	her interest	in	multiple	viewpoints	(e.g.	Granade’s	Common	Ground	1999)	or	her interest	in	rich,	situated	implementation	(e.g.	Barlow’s	Aisle	1999). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	2001,	Graham	Nelson	released	the	fourth	edition	of	the	Inform	Designer’s Manual,	a	programmer’s	guide	for	his	IF	development	language	Inform.	The expanded	edition	contains	the	article	“A	short	history	of	interactive	fiction” </p>
<p class="calibre1">(342-367)	which	opens	with	a	periodization	ending	in	an	accounting	of	current aesthetic	trends	in	IF	away	from	the	valorization	of	difficulty: The	history	of	interactive	fiction	in	the	20th	century	has	yet	to	be	written.	One outline	might	be	as	follows:	an	age	of	precursors	and	university	games,	1972-81; the	commercial	boom,	1982-6;	a	period	of	nostalgia	among	Internet	users	for text	while	the	industry	completed	the	move	to	graphic	games,	1987-91;	and	the age	of	the	Usenet	newsgroup	rec.arts.int-fiction	and	its	annual	competition,	of shorter	stories	moving	away	from	genres	and	puzzles,	1992-9.	(342) Also	in	2001,	Dennis	G.	Jerz	released	his	invaluable	“Annotated	Bibliography of	Interactive	Fiction	Scholarship”	(later	published	in	TEXT	Technology).	While his	extensive	annotations	have	not	yet	been	synthesized	into	a	formal	argument about	IF,	Jerz	broke	the	silence	on	contemporary	IF	that	had	endured	in academic	criticism	since	Randall’s	article	at	the	tail-end	of	the	commercial	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>era,	and	his	bibliography	notably	includes	reportage,	personal	essays,	reviews, manifestos	and	so	forth	from	outside	academia	(including	Nelson’s	text). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Together	these	paint	a	truer	portrait	of	the	past	decade	of	IF	authorship	and critical	theory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	2003	Montfort’s	Twisty	Little	Passages:	an	approach	to	interactive	fiction was	another	breakthrough	event	�	the	first	critical	monograph	exclusively devoted	to	IF.	Setting	out	to	make	a	forceful	argument	about	IF	and	art,	Montfort along	the	way	becomes	both	ambassador	and	historian,	providing	a	gentle introduction	and	detailed	survey	from	the	earliest	works	to	the	time	of publication,	including	notably	some	consideration	of	international	and multilingual	work.	Montfort’s	description	of	IF	as	artistic	genre	based	in	the riddle	is	a	significant	argument	in	the	context	of	this	ongoing	conversation	on frustration	and	IF	aesthetics	for	several	reasons.	First,	it	ties	structural	critical analysis	to	an	argument	about	aesthetics	explicitly	and	convincingly	for	the	first time.	Literary	riddles	are	not	merely	a	metaphoric	label	for	a	deep	structure	(like Aarseth’s	intrigue)	but	presented	as	an	actual	ancestor	genre	to	IF,	which Montfort	articulates	as	having	related	aesthetics	and	ethics.	Second,	this argument	is	delivered	in	the	context	of	a	survey	of	hundreds	of	widely	disparate IF	works	from	1976-2002	�	a	welcome	relief	from	endlessly	rehashing Adventure	and	Deadline.	Third,	Montfort’s	account	comes	down	definitively	in the	Buckles-Aarseth	camp	of	productive	frustration,	and	indeed	is	structurally and	terminologically	continuous	with	their	arguments	in	many	respects,	yet	it goes	further	in	formulating	a	rhetorically	elegant	and	concise	explanation	of	the value-system	whereby	this	difficulty-of-the-gap	will	be	appreciated	as	art	and literature.	Comparing	Montfort’s	“solve	a	riddle”	(complete	with	classical examples)	to	Buckle’s	“conduct	the	scientific	method”	or	to	Aarseth’s	“be	the innocent,	but	voluntary,	target	of	an	intrigue,”	Montfort	has	clearly	been	most successful	in	rhetorically	recasting	the	core	situation	of	IF	(and	hence	its	core problematic	of	frustration)	in	positive	artistic	terms	explicable	to	a	lay	audience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	its	thesis	is	established,	Twisty	Little	Passages	provides	an	accessible, descriptive	survey	with	the	overriding	rhetorical	intent	of	breaking	silence	on	the diversity	of	innovative	classic	and	contemporary	IF	works.	Yet	it	is	not	a	work	of close	analyses	or	close	interactions.	Montfort	takes	very	seriously	the	premise that	IF	aesthetics	are	grounded	in	the	riddle,	to	the	extent	that	his	book incorporates	a	convention	for	marking	off	in	boxes	any	spoiler	paragraphs	that might	discuss	a	work’s	premise	or	execution	in	enough	detail	to	ruin	an interactors’	pleasure	(15).	Boxes	do	not	overwhelm	the	prose,	however.	As	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>arguments	must	read	without	the	support	of	spoilers,	spoiler	boxes	are	sharply delimited	as	occasional	digressions	from	an	otherwise	responsible	survey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Montfort’s	compunction	over	spoilers	extends	also	to	his	treatment	of	the	future of	IF	aesthetics.	Gently	mocking	both	Gary	McGath	(1984)	and	himself	(1995) for	believing	that	increased	realism	and	real-time	interaction	would	eventually become	the	dominant	direction	of	future	IF	(which	they	clearly	have	not	and probably	will	not),	Montfort	eschews	further	speculation: Speculation	about	what	sort	of	interactive	fiction	will	be	created	in	years	to come	not	only	is	unusually	unproductive,	but	can	also	be	counterproductive.	To blithely	mention	the	riddle	of	a	hypothetical	IF	work	effectively	ruins	the	work for	any	future	interactors	who	read	such	a	prognostication.	The	supposedly hypothetical	work	that	is	so	ruined	may	in	fact	already	be	in	development[…]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(228-229)</p>
<p class="calibre1">This	sentiment	compares	to	my	foreword	to	this	study	on	the	concept	of spoilers	and	foreclosure,	although	here	as	a	pass	from	analysis	rather	than	a license	for	it.	It	is	difficult	to	entirely	give	Montfort	such	pass	on	prediction, however,	given	that	describing	structural	innovations	or	design	trends	are	not,	in and	of	themselves,	“spoilers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	final	work	for	our	consideration	in	this	aesthetic	history	is	Maher’s	2006</p>
<p class="calibre1">thesis	Let’s	Tell	a	Story	Together:	a	history	of	interactive	fiction,	which	builds on	Montfort’s	(among	others).	More	detailed	and	factual	than	abstractly conceptual,	it	is	narrated	from	a	strong	insider	point	of	view	on	the contemporary	scene,	and	punctuated	with	appraisals	of	the	design	successes	and failures	of	past	works.	These	standards	of	evaluation	are	practical	rather	than formally	articulated,	and	are	primarily	akin	to	the	evaluation	of	artistic	unities: instead	of	action,	place,	and	time,	they	relate	to	strength	of	parser,	coherence	of story	with	environment,	and	balance	of	difficulty	(a	sort	of	undisrupted	action, place,	and	time	as	experienced	by	the	interactor). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maher’s	primary	commentary	on	contemporary	works	is	to	discuss	those	that mark	the	emergence	of	various	significant	authoring	languages	in	the	early	90s, or	multimedia	techniques	in	the	late	90s,	or	rare	commercial	sales.	Even	he	is	too overwhelmed	to	undertake	discussion	of	significant	works	since	1993. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suggesting	instead	some	future	book-length	study,	Maher	restricts	himself	to brief	capsule	reviews	of	99	chronologically	listed	works,	a	“wealth	of	riches” </p>
<p class="calibre1">whose	sampling	will	prove	IF’s	progress:	“I	hope	that	one	thing	will	soon</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a>become	abundantly	clear:	the	golden	age	of	IF	is	now.”	Montfort,	by comparison,	is	similarly	bullish,	also	as	matter	of	fact	rather	than	speculation:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“[I]t	is	hard	not	to	notice	the	formal,	thematic,	computational,	and	literary innovation	that	is	happening	today	and	that	promises	to	continue”	(221). </p>
<p class="calibre1">IF	and	riddle	aesthetics:	care	with	a	macro	metaphor At	this	point	I’d	like	to	draw	the	strands	of	this	critical	history	together	into	a framing	conversation	about	IF	aesthetics.	Many	of	the	previous	critics	use methods	or	metaphors	suggestive	of	a	master	trope	for	IF	aesthetics.	Buckles’s scientific	method,	Randall’s	avant-garde	defamiliarization,	Sloane’s	Objectivist epistemology,	Murray’s	trope-scripting,	Aarseth’s	intrigue,	and	Montfort’s puzzles	all	suggest	not	just	a	means	of	understanding	the	work,	but	specific interaction	authoring	strategies	or	design	patterns	that	anticipate	a	particular interactor	experience.	Buckles,	Aarseth,	and	Montfort’s	patterns	might	be described	as	designing	for	productive	frustration.	For	Randall,	Murray,	and Sloane,	frustration	is	unproductive.	Randall	sees	this	as	a	problem	solved through	the	omission	of	puzzles;	Murray	sees	good	IF	design	as	an	exemplar	of assuaging	the	problem	of	frustration	through	strongly	framing	expectations;	and Sloane	sees	IF	design	as	typified	or	even	defined	thus	far	by	the	failure	to	avoid frustration	due	to	its	ideological	focus	on	unreasonably	setting	narrow expectations.	Montfort,	as	described,	frames	frustrating	art	(“the	puzzle”) strongly	in	positive	terms.	His	subsequent	survey	further	lends	this	view considerable	weight	by	grounding	it	in	a	previously	absent	range	of	examples. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Montfort’s	“riddle”	approach	is	not	the	last	word	in	IF	theory,	of	course.	Its very	rhetorical	elegance	risks	simplifying	and	confusing	several	important issues,	and	the	work	also	fails	(as	have	others)	to	respond	adequately	to	Sloane’s critique.	On	the	issue	of	the	riddle	approach	as	a	rhetorical	oversimplification	in particular,	I	have	two	concerns.	My	first	concern	is	that	a	work	of	IF	is	seldom	a riddle	in	anything	but	the	most	extended	of	senses,	although	most	might	be	more credibly	described	as	puzzles.	This	is	because	the	riddle	is	ultimately	a	better metaphor	for	a	small	group	of	interactions	or	even	a	single	interaction	within	a work	of	IF.	The	moment	of	closure	of	some	state	change	that	the	interactor considers	a	strategic	advancement	is	much	like	one	question	that	demands	one answer.	Like	the	critics	before	him,	Montfort	is	addressing	the	multitude	of	gaps that	make	up	an	IF	work	and	characterize	its	aesthetics.	Yet	he	does	not	present riddle-books	or	riddle-collections	as	an	artistic	ancestor	(which	in	contemporary culture	are	generally	seen	as	tawdry	affairs),	nor	any	form	of	riddle-networks	(if</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a>such	things	exist	and	are	acknowledged	as	art)	but	instead	the	riddle	(singular)	in itself.	An	IF	work,	however,	is	generally	a	network	of	riddles,	often	with complex	inter-relationships,	and	traversals	are	often	not	the	sequential negotiation	of	each,	but	some	subset	across	their	topology,	a	very	different proposition	than	that	presented	by	the	Sphinx.	IF	works	may	be	riddling	in	a sustained	way,	but	the	risk	for	critical	theory	here	is	what	is	known	as	the	fallacy of	composition:	we	may	presume	the	operational	behaviors	of	chemistry	pertain in	biology,	so	to	speak,	letting	the	overarching	metaphor	of	the	riddle	mislead	us in	describing	what	an	overall	IF	work	does.	The	riddle	is	characterized	primarily by	unitary	simplicity,	the	puzzle	(and	most	IF)	primarily	by	complex	intricacy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	is	not	to	say	that	a	riddle	cannot	have	several	parts.	The	Sphinx	riddle requires	the	interpretation	of	two	interlocking	metaphors,	one	for	time	(a	life passes	like	a	single	day)	and	another	for	limbs	(human	limbs,	including	their technological	extensions	such	as	the	cane,	remain	like	animal	limbs).	Taken	as	a whole,	the	Sphinx	riddle	is	a	parable	for	human	humility,	as	it	reflects	a	Sphinx-like	worldview	on	humans	as	short-lived	creatures	that	deem	themselves superior	to	beasts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	second	concern	in	regard	to	the	riddle	approach	to	IF	follows	from	my first	concern,	as	the	approach	is	(necessarily,	as	all	approaches	are)	a	lens	and ideology	of	IF	aesthetics,	and	one	that	(unlike	Twisty	Little	Passages	overall) tends	to	orient	us	towards	a	quite	specific	subset	of	IF	works.	For	example, Montfort’s	chooses	in	his	section	The	Independents	(193-221)	to	discuss	Graham Nelson’s	Curses,	Rees’s	Christminster,	the	works	of	Andrew	Plotkin,	the	works of	Adam	Cadre,	and	those	of	a	few	more	recent	authors,	in	particular	Jon	Ingold and	Emily	Short.	Arguably	these	are	all	historically	significant,	critically	well received,	and	representative	of	established	authors	with	multiple	works.	They also	generally	reflect	a	particular	kind	of	difficulty	whose	solution	is	a	kind	of tour	de	force	of	the	work’s	machinations,	crafted	to	be	riddle-like	en	toto	in	a kind	of	macroscopic	self-similarity	of	the	way	they	are	necessarily	riddle-like	in their	particulars.	Thus	Montfort	comments	in	passing	that	Ingold	“does	not	yet bring	puzzles	together	with	the	process	of	generating	narrative	as	powerfully	as in	the	riddle-like	works	of	Plotkin,”	(220)	in	this	moment	echoing	a	general technique	of	evaluation	common	in	hundreds	of	IF	reviews	in	community journals	and	archives,	and	seen	later	in	the	writing	of	Maher.	Seeking	this parallel	is	not	an	unreasonable	aesthetics	or	canon	for	IF;	in	fact,	my	own reading	of	Plotkin’s	Shade	in	Ch.	2	largely	reflects	this	sensibility.	This	is	only one	potential	IF	aesthetics	and	canon,	however,	and	not	necessarily	reflective	of either	dominant	trends	in	authorship	or	even	a	comprehensive	trend	in	the	best</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>received	works,	many	of	which	can	be	deeply	un-riddle-like.	All	emerge	out	of and	in	relation	to	the	way	the	riddle-like	gap	shapes	experience	at	the	micro-level,	but	the	ways	this	can	be	artfully	incorporated	are	widely	varied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	summary,	my	caveats	are	that	the	riddle-approach	may	cause	us	to	confuse the	aesthetics	of	the	gap	with	the	genre’s	overall	nature,	and	that	this	confusion can	become	an	aesthetic	program	which,	no	matter	how	valid,	risks	creating	a process	of	critical	confirmation-bias	that	occludes	how	gap-aesthetics	actually emerge	in	their	variety.	Still,	these	differences	may	be	vanishing	in	their	actual application.	Montfort	and	I	are	both	basically	pursing	an	approach	that	Buckles initiated	over	twenty	years	ago,	with	Montfort	emphasizing	the	guiding, overarching	metaphor	of	beautiful	difficulty	and	myself	stressing	a	local, cognitivist	/	reader-response	engagement	with	the	unknown.	The	contribution	of this	study	is	its	emphasis	on	analytic	methodology	as	actually	applied	in	close interaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IF	and	puppet	theory:	untenable	expectations</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	issue	of	Sloane’s	critique	is	a	more	serious	one.	Why	is	the	interactor	so frustratingly	distanced	from	what	she	terms	the	puppet?	I	personally	suspect	that Sloane	either	misunderstands	or	is	in	the	end	uninterested	in	the	semiotic simulation	form	of	which	IF	is	part.	To	the	extent	that	it	can	ever	address	her interests,	her	more	appropriate	object	of	study	is	not	Blank’s	Deadline	but advanced	research	since	the	Oz	Project,	particularly	Mateas	and	Stern’s	Fa�ade, which	provides	an	unambiguous,	flexible,	real-time	environment	wrapped around	the	permissive	rather	than	prescriptive	simulation	of	a	dramatic conversation.	Nevertheless,	Sloane	is	unflinching	in	addressing	some	of	the	core aspects	of	IF	that	reliably	alienate	potential	audiences,	and	in	doing	so repeatedly	suggests	one	of	the	key	issues	of	IF	design	and	aesthetics:	What should	the	role	of	the	protagonist	(or	player	character,	puppet,	agent)	be	in relation	to	the	interactor’s	frustration? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bypassing	this	problem	is	not	unique	to	Montfort’s	book.	Randall	describes the	problem	of	frustration	as	immanently	solved;	with	two	decades	hindsight	on literary	IF	this	is	clearly	is	not	the	case.	By	contrast,	Aarseth	registers	an	echo	of Sloane’s	critique	in	his	deep	discomfort	with	how	the	‘intrigue’	of	Deadline breaks	“the	ergodic	contract”	with	the	interactor,	as	for	example	the	replies	when the	interactor	attempts	to	make	the	detective	take	a	second	drink	of	scotch	(“you must	resist	the	temptation	to	indulge	too	often”)	or	hit	a	character	(“You	rethink</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a>your	planned	action”).	For	Aarseth,	these	are	clear	examples	of	code	oppressing of	the	interactor:	“to	punish	the	noncooperative	intriguee,	the	intrigant	must break	the	illusion	of	free	interaction	[through]	thought	control”	(121).	This	point of	view	is	inherited	more	or	less	directly	from	his	use	of	the	term	“puppet”	for protagonist,	which,	as	with	Sloane’s	earlier	use	of	the	same	term	(23-24),	is	a misappropriation	from	cyberspace	and	virtual	reality	(VR).	Cyberspace	and	VR</p>
<p class="calibre1">researchers	have	been	primarily	concerned	with	the	direct	projection	of	a controlled	correspondence,	or	avatar.	This	scenario	bears	little	relation	to semiotic	communications	in	which	the	protagonist	serves	as	an	agent	or representative.	The	unnamed	detective	of	Deadline,	in	other	words,	has	a	strong id	in	the	interactor,	but	also	a	superego	in	the	code:	the	detective	may	indulge	his interactor’s	impulse	to	drink,	but	his	code	will	quash	the	temptation	to	do	so	to excess	while	working;	the	detective	may	acknowledge	his	interactor’s	violent thoughts,	yet	suppress	them	with	his	code’s	conscience.	Action	is	negotiated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	should	the	interactor	succeed	in	driving	the	detective	to	some	act	he	would not	normally	perform	(e.g.	insisting	on	violence),	the	work	may	continue	to display	the	superego’s	objection	even	in	the	aftermath	of	being	overruled	(e.g. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	could	I	have	done	it?”). </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	am	not	merely	protesting	that	Deadline’s	rejections	can	be	enjoyable	if approached	with	the	right	attitude.	Any	conception	of	IF	interaction	through	the metaphor	of	the	puppet	(whether	termed	puppet,	player	character,	avatar	etc.)	is only	of	limited	use	in	understanding	a	small	subset	of	IF	texts.	Further, subscribing	to	such	understandings	engenders	misconceptions	and	inappropriate expectations.	This	is	because	semiotic	control	(a	description	of	how	IF	actually occurs,	at	the	command	line)	and	puppet	control	(a	metaphor)	bear	little	relation and	only	coincidentally	overlap	in	effects.	Puppet	control	is	a	negotiation between	the	embodied	ability	of	the	individual	and	the	fixed	limits	of	a	discrete object	(as	with	the	flexible	cloth	of	a	Punch	or	Judy	puppet	occupied	by	an organic	hand,	or	the	jointed	limbs	of	a	marionette	attached	by	strings	to	the naturally	articulated	fingers).	Within	that	range,	the	puppeteer	is	free	to	act through	the	puppet.	These	free-ranging	actions	encounter	interactions	from surrounding	theatrical	mechanisms	within	the	context	of	the	stage,	yet	the	strings remain	the	puppeteer’s	alone.	This	is	often	a	quite	good	analogy	for	the	way	the interface	to	an	avatar	works	as	a	locus	of	total	control	in	a	constraining	world,	as when	a	video	game	maps	controller	buttons	onto	physics-engine	forces	exerted on	and	by	the	avatar,	attempting	to	maintain	a	very	close	low-level approximation	between	the	push	of	a	thumb-stick	and	the	tug	of	a	puppet	string. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a>Under	the	surface,	semiotic	control	at	the	command	line	does	not	function	like a	puppet,	nor	could	it.	The	IF	interactor	is	a	poor	puppeteer.	Instead,	a	better metaphor	is	the	id.	Beginning	in	an	impulse,	the	message	passes	into	negotiation with	a	larger	system	of	self	(ego,	superego)	that	first	attempts	to	understand	it, and	then	affirms	it,	modifies	it,	or	disciplines	it,	sometimes	in	unpredictable ways.	From	the	perspective	of	the	id,	external	forces	encountered	in	this negotiation	may	seem	alien	and	other,	but	the	whole	makes	up	a	set	of	desires and	constraints	that	we	might	identify	as	a	self.	Just	so,	the	interactor	cannot	be embodied	through	a	constrained	object	as	with	a	hand	to	a	puppet.	Language doesn’t	do	that.	Instead,	the	interactor	must	pass	a	message	to	a	protagonist.	This message	may	be	from	an	inner	standing	point	(as	the	id	to	the	self),	or	a	variety of	other	standing	points,	but	regardless	it	must	be	interpreted.	Such interpretations	can	be	misunderstood,	ignored,	modified,	or	subjected	to	any	of the	other	interesting	effects	that	one	might	expect	of	an	interlocutor	addressed with	a	speech	act	but	not	expect	of	a	puppet	controlled	by	a	hand	(save	an uncannily	possessed	puppet).	Due	to	architectural	necessity,	the	parser	stands	not beyond	the	puppet	in	the	simulated	world,	but	between	the	interactor	and	a character	�	a	fact	which	makes	the	expectation	of	untangled	strings	difficult	for an	IF	design	to	live	up	to.	This	character	is	the	primary	or	focalizing	locus	of action	and	agency	(both	originating	in	the	interactor	and	otherwise),	and	thus	is best	described	as	the	“first	actor”	�	that	is,	the	protagonist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Semiotic	control	cannot	provide	continuity	as	between	a	hand	and	a	puppet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still,	does	the	command	line	have	a	moral	or	aesthetic	responsibility	to	emulate such	continuity?	That	is,	is	there	an	implicit	‘contract’	between	code	and interactor	�	a	contract	stating	that	the	protagonist	must	embody	the	interactor’s desires	as	faithfully	as	possible?	It	is	certainly	possible	to	design	IF	works around	this	premise.	Yet	such	works	are	ultimately	doomed	at	the	fringes	of	their designs.	A	work	of	IF	is	finite,	and	hence	necessarily	constraining.	Because	the command	line	admits	freeform	input,	interactors	can	and	will	inevitably interrogate	unafforded	objects,	locations,	and	events.	This	is	an	innate	situation of	freeform	input,	and	the	only	design	recourse	is	to	leave	the	form	and	create not-IF.	As	these	limit-moments	(or	errors)	are	sure	to	arrive,	the	only	question	is how	to	represent	them	when	they	do.	The	protagonist	arrives	at	the	front	door	of her	apartment	during	a	work	that	represents	a	living-room	drama,	and	the interactor	decides	to	leave.	Yet	the	work	is	not	a	true	world,	and	it	does	not extend	beyond	the	house	that	bounds	the	author’s	intentions.	How	can	this situation	be	accommodated	when	the	interactor	types	“OPEN	DOOR”?	Here	are a	few	methods:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>1.	Omit:	Don’t	include	a	front	door	in	any	description,	or	allow	navigation	to anything	like	an	entryway.	The	house	as	described	has	no	front	door.	Of	course, the	interactor	may	still	decide	to	type	OPEN	DOOR	or	LEAVE,	in	which	case the	author	may	still	need	to	use	one	of	the	following	methods	as	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2.	Leave	unimplemented:	Describe	a	door,	but	ignore	it	completely	in	code	(“I don’t	know	what	a	‘DOOR’	is”)	or	catch	it	with	a	standard	error	(“You	can’t	do that”)	with	no	explanation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">3.	Constrain	the	world:	Create	an	external,	diegetic	reason	(environment)	why the	door	can’t	be	opened	in	setting	the	scene,	physically	delimiting	the possibility	space	(“All	snowed	in,	and	the	crew	won’t	be	around	to	help	dig	out the	front	door	for	hours.”). </p>
<p class="calibre1">4.	Constrain	the	protagonist:	Create	an	internal,	diegetic	reason	(superego)	why the	door	shouldn’t	be	opened,	psychically	delimiting	the	possibility	space	(“As you	are	about	to	step	out,	you	remember	your	promise	to	baby-sit.	Darn.”). </p>
<p class="calibre1">5.	Quit:	Any	attempt	to	leave	the	limits	of	the	simulation	ends	it	with	a	specific or	general	message	(“Sure,	you	promised	to	baby-sit,	but	what	could	happen? </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	step	out	the	door.	THE	END”).	This	is	a	small	death	for	the	story,	so	it	may need	to	be	forewarned,	for	example	first	indicating	a	psychic	constraint	and	then terminating	if	the	interactor	insists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Note	that	the	first	four	messages	are	functionally	similar.	They	are	different text	strings	added	to	the	events	that	inform	the	interactor	that	the	state	of	the system	has	not	changed	in	response	to	the	OPEN	DOOR	request.	Of	those, however,	the	described	constraints	feel	like	a	continuity	of	the	simulation.	They are	limits,	but	limits	within	the	bounding	box	of	description	rather	than	outside it.	The	possibility	space	of	an	IF	work	is	bounded	by	a	multitude	of	limits	�</p>
<p class="calibre1">both	as	many	as	are	articulated	in	the	work	and	as	many	as	are	interrogated	by the	interactor.	Most	designs	will	delimit	the	work	and	anticipate	out-of-bounds interaction	using	some	mix	of	all	these	methods.	These	will	often	be	chosen based	on	prediction	(some	actions	are	not	planned	for	incorporation,	but	are anticipated)	and	sometimes	based	on	plausibility.	The	author	could	use	an internal	event	to	stop	the	curator	from	taking	the	gem	without	permission,	or	use an	external	event	described	in	the	form	of	a	guard.	One	immediate	consequence of	denying	the	right	of	IF	designs	to	explore	the	full	range	of	semiotic	(that	is, negotiated)	control,	and	instead	demanding	that	they	emulate	a	subset	of	puppet</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a>control,	is	that	IF	designs	thus	restricted	become	extremely	limited	in	their	range of	allowable	subjects.	A	puppet	theory	of	IF	allows	that	an	author	may	create	an IF	about	an	elevator	occupant	trapped	in	an	elevator	(limit	described	as external),	but	proscribes	that	the	author	may	create	an	IF	about	an	elevator operator	unwilling	to	leave	her	post	(limit	described	as	internal).	Likewise	under puppet	theory	one	may	perhaps	create	an	IF	about	a	baby-sitter	who	cannot DROP	anything	(consistent	structural	limit),	but	once	implemented	the	DROP</p>
<p class="calibre1">verb	must	allow	the	baby-sitter	to	both	DROP	TOY	and	DROP	BABY,	and	this second	action	may	not	be	blocked	by	the	sitter’s	conscience	(his	inconsistent psychological	limit),	whether	or	not	this	violence	is	a	scenario	that	the	author	is interested	in	exploring.	In	a	sense,	the	argument	against	puppet	theory	is simultaneously	an	argument	for	artistic	freedom:	IF	authors	are	writers	of	artful rules,	and	puppet	theory	is	a	proposed	contract	which	sharply	limits	which	rules they	may	write	and	how	they	are	allowed	to	represent	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet	artistic	freedom	is	a	misleading	invocation,	as	this	recalls	the	original, almost	primal	complaint	of	puppet	theory	that	certain	kinds	of	constraint	are	an oppression	of	interactor	freedom:	my	hand,	my	puppet,	your	world;	don’t	tread on	me.	I	have	tried	to	outline	a	structural	argument	that	the	command	line	gives rise	to	certain	fundamental	situations	(ambiguity	and	semiotic	control)	out	of which	certain	aesthetics	and	metaphors	for	design	and	interaction	(e.g.	the	id)	are more	aesthetically	productive	than	others	(e.g.	the	puppet)	for	both	authors	and interactors.	Freedom,	however,	is	a	highly	charged	area	of	debate	in	critical theory	across	many	new	media	genres,	and	it	often	seems	to	become	a	protracted shouting	match	between	artistic	freedom	and	audience	freedom.	I’d	like	to modestly	suggest	a	term	substitution	that	frames	a	different	discussion. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>From	freedom	to	enfranchisement The	open	source	and	free	software	movements	have	made	much	in	the	past two	decades	over	the	unfortunate	conjunction	in	English	of	the	word	free	(as	in freedom)	with	the	word	free	(as	in	gratis),	an	overlap	which	tends	to	obscure	the distinction	between	software	that	one	obtains	for	no	money	and	software	that one	is	able	to	use	to	any	purpose	whatsoever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Freedom	is	likewise	a	confusing	concept	in	the	discussion	of	textual	media,	as it	tends	to	conflate	the	strict	meaning	of	liberty,	or	acting	within	a	set	of	rules	or constraining	context,	with	the	strict	meaning	of	anarchy,	or	acting	outside	a	set of	rules	or	constraining	context.	Anarchy	is	a	politically	charged	word.	I	use	it	in this	technical	sense,	not	to	imply	that	allowing	an	anarchic	protagonist	is desirable	or	undesirable,	but	rather	to	point	out	that	realizing	an	anarchic protagonist	is	structurally	improbable	given	the	nature	of	the	code	art	objects	we are	engaging.	The	etymology	of	anarchy	or	anarkhos	�	“without	ruler”	�</p>
<p class="calibre1">recalls	our	previous	uses	of	Derrida’s	Archive	Fever	in	Ch.	2,	and	suggests	that while	the	interactor	might	join	with	the	ambivalent	figure	of	the	arkhon	(or ruler),	she	may	never	truly	escape	the	context	of	the	archive	(or	rules).	The	only respite	is	outside	this	realm	of	art	entirely	in	relation	to	codeless	or	completely non-semiotic	objects	�	perhaps	a	blank	sheet	of	paper	or	tabula	rasa	(if	then). </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	“freedom”	in	one	of	its	more	common	and	amorphous	senses	is	impossible (or	it	least	difficult	to	conceive)	in	the	context	of	the	IF	work,	then	replacing	it with	“liberty”	seems	to	me	hardly	more	productive.	While	the	term	is	technically more	accurate,	its	common	emotional	valence	is	almost	as	skewed.	As	an alternative,	I	submit	that	the	more	helpful	terminology	might	be	enfranchisement and	disenfranchisement,	which	brings	with	it	both	a	descriptive	specificity	and an	etymological	history	that	elucidates	the	ambivalent	relationship	of	action	to the	constraining	context	of	(legal)	code. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	root	of	enfranchisement,	‘franchise,’	has	a	businesslike	connotation	in contemporary	culture	(e.g.	a	fast	food	franchise),	but	it	is	essentially	a	license	to carry	out	activities	�	that	is,	agency	as	codified	in	legal	code.	In	its	more sonorous	form,	“the	franchise”	signifies	the	rights	of	citizenship	in	terms	of	its responsibilities,	such	as	voting.	In	the	U.S.,	“enfranchisement”	has	historically been	employed	in	discourses	both	on	slavery	and	on	women’s	‘suffrage’	(an	18th century	U.S.	coinage	for	the	right	to	vote).	Suffrage	has	its	own	unique</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a>etymology	in	relation	to	the	concept	of	engagement	with	rule	(rather	than	release from	rule),	as	the	original	and	primary	meaning	of	the	word	since	late	Middle English	has	always	been	“intercessory	prayers.”	It	is	this	idea	of	petition	that crossed	over	from	God	to	government. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enfranchisement	and	its	role	in	suffrage,	I	would	suggest,	is	a	productive alternative	concept	for	use	whenever	conducting	the	“freedom	vs.	constraint” </p>
<p class="calibre1">debates	which	periodically	flare	up	between	the	more	adventist	or	messianic liberation-theologians	of	new	media	(who	in	declaring	periodic	revolutions continually	recognize	in	each	new	media	form	some	kind	of	anarchic	utopia	for interactors)	and	their	adversaries,	reactionary	or	fascistic	born-again	formalists (who	in	their	zeal	for	constitutive	structures	often	cannot	distinguish inspirational	monument	from	oppressive	bureaucracy).	Rather	than	discussing whether	the	interactor	is	free	or	must	be	made	free,	we	can	discuss	how	the	work does	enfranchise	or	might	enfranchise	the	interactor	�	that	is,	how	it	does	or might	bring	the	interactor	fully	into	some	level	of	participation	and	engagement with	the	code.	This	is	not	necessarily	the	same	thing	as	to	free	the	interactor from	constraint	or	rule	in	the	sense	of	anarkhos;	in	fact,	it	may	often	(but	not always)	be	the	opposite.	Still,	it	may	evoke	a	sensibility	of	ambivalent	hope about	the	desired	negotiation	that	resonates	with	the	long	history	of	civil	rights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	an	interactor	to	desire	enfranchisement	is	not	just	a	wish	to	throw	off	the chains	of	a	work,	but	to	become	part	of	the	work,	and	perhaps	in	doing	so change	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IF	characterization:	directing	protagonists</p>
<p class="calibre1">Puppet	theory	encourages	a	systematic	misunderstanding	of	semiotic simulation,	and	tends	to	inspire	objections	that	are	fundamentally	anarchic	�</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	is,	against	code.	I	have	described	puppet	theory	as	a	poor	metaphor misappropriated	from	VR,	and	this	is	true,	but	the	situation	was	exacerbated	by	a design	pattern	in	early	IF	that	tended	to	make	the	protagonist	generic	and implicitly	(rather	than	explicitly)	characterized.

Some	of	these	protagonists	are	psychologically	specific	out	of	the necessities	of	literary	adaptation,  <i class="calibre3">e.g. </i>	Watson	from	Bob	Bates’s	Sherlock:	The Riddle	of	the	Crown	Jewels,	1987.	Others	are	psychologically	specific	due	to	the concept	of	the	work,  <i class="calibre3">e.g. </i>	the	small-time	archaeological	plunderer	protagonist	of Berlyn	and	Fogleman’s	Infidel	is	arrogant	and	avaricious,	perfectly complimenting	the	work’s	larger	tale	of	hubris	and	sacrilege. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	original	implied	interactors	of	Adventure	were	two	young	girls,	the daughters	of	Will	Crowther.	The	fact	is	often	remarked	anecdotally	but	seldom taken	seriously	for	its	aesthetic	implications.	This	first	‘uncharacterized’	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">protagonist	was	located	on	an	axis	within	an	interpretive	community	of	three actual	(rather	than	implied)	interactors,	one	of	whom	was	the	actual	author.	The protagonist	figure	was	either	a	projection	of	the	daughter-as-explorer	or	else	a simulation	of	exploration	as	though	experienced	through	the	eyes	of	their	father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	interactor-protagonist	relationship	was	complicated	by	the	subsequent	co-authorships	of	Don	Woods	and	the	‘folk’	period.	By	the	corporate	transfiguration of	Adventure	in	Zork,	Murray	interprets	the	resultant	figure,	not	as	an adventurous	daughter	(whether	filtered	through	the	person	of	her	absent	father	or not),	but	instead	as	a	prototypical	computer	programmer	turned	fantastic adventurer	(like	Crowther).	The	interactor	/	protagonist	roles	of	early	IF	suggest many	contradictory	figures:	youth	 <i class="calibre3">adult,	child	</i> parent,	female	 <i class="calibre3">male,	introvert</i> extrovert,	and	so	forth.	Some	of	these	reversals	may	not	be	accidents	of	history, but	rather	grounded	in	the	way	fiction	and	games	can	both	provide	safe	spaces for	representations	or	simulations	of	reality.	If	an	adult	parent	first	visits	a	real cave	and	then	creates	a	safely	simulated	cave	for	the	young,	then	that	act	of creation	is	based	on	the	gap	between	the	real	interactor	(child)	and	the protagonist	(parent),	and	the	resulting	work	contains	its	own	built-in	reversal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet	instead	of	exploring	these	provocative	binaries	critics	usually	arrive	at	a common	misconception	of	IF	as	usually	having	an	uncharacterized	(and	hence superego-less)	protagonist.	This	may	in	part	be	attributable	to	the	Infocom’s Zork	series,	which	worked	particularly	hard	to	maintain	the	adventurer	as	a featureless	(but	adventurous)	figure.	In	Infonotes,	Graeme	Cree	remarks	part	of this	tradition:</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	Zork:	Grand	Inquisitor,	your	character	is	known	as	AFGNCAAP	(Ageless Faceless	Gender	Neutral	Culturally	Ambiguous	Adventure	Person),	a	description of	a	large	number	of	main	characters	in	Interactive	Fiction.	Indeed,	in	Zork	3, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>when	you	encounter	the	figure	that	looks	like	you,	both	ATTACK	MAN	and ATTACK	WOMAN	will	work	when	you	are	fighting	him	 <i class="calibre3">her	</i> it.	Nice	touch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	AFGNCAAP	is	indeed	the	culmination	of	a	more	general	strategy	on	the part	of	Infocom	to	omit	anything	except	those	characteristics	most	central	to	the protagonist’s	ego	and	situation.	Gender,	for	example,	was	routinely	excluded from	the	description	of	works	where	it	was	deemed	unnecessary,  <i class="calibre3">e.g. </i>	the	Zork series.	Other	works	were	built	around	the	concept	of	the	protagonist’s	gender	(as in	Amy	Briggs’s	Plundered	Hearts,	1987).	Still	other	works	allowed	the interactor	to	configure	gender	at	the	beginning,	and	then	varied	the	gender representations	of	other	characters	in	relation	to	the	interactor’s	choice	(as	in Douglas	Adams’s	Bureaucracy,	1987).	Of	these	configurable	IF	works,	Steve Meretzky’s	1986	space-opera	sex-farce	Leather	Goddesses	of	Phobos	(LGOP) was	particularly	notorious	for	presenting	a	gender-configurable	protagonist	who might	experience	either	of	two	structurally	identical	(but	superficially	gender-inverted)	sexual	escapades.	The	level	of	explicit	sexual	description	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘naughtiness’	in	the	work	could	further	be	configured	as	‘tame’,	‘suggestive,’	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘lewd,’	although	this	likewise	changed	the	texture	rather	than	the	structure	of	the work.	One	of	the	interesting	lessons	of	LGOP	is	that	characterization	in simulation	is	at	least	as	much	about	possibility	and	afforded	agency	as	it	is	about descriptive	characteristics.	LGOP	is	about	a	largely	heteronormative	escapade (in	which	opposites	are	the	objects	of	desire),	yet	it	is	one	in	which	gender representation	lies	lightly	over	a	fixed	logic	of	desire.	The	protagonist’s	dim-witted	assistant	Trent	may	instead	be	Tiffany,	or	a	sultan’s	harem	of	wives	may become	a	sultana’s	harem	of	husbands,	but	the	attitudes	and	actions	of	sidekick and	spouse	remain	identical.	This	is	not	to	say	that	either	spouse	or	sidekick	is characterless.	Their	true	characteristics	are	found	in	what	they	will	or	will	not do,	and	in	LGOP	these	characteristics	transcend	their	descriptive	configuration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	AFGNCAPP,	in	other	words,	represented	one	particular	approach	to	the question	of	protagonist	characterization	that	was	often	minimal	but	seldom eliminated	entirely.	Even	granting	a	predominant	AFGNCAPP,	there	remains	a substantial	difference	between	attempting	to	represent	a	featureless	humanoid	(in as	much	as	that	is	possible)	and	presenting	one	without	superego,	as	the	puppet theory	demands.	The	Zork	works	are	fairly	meticulous	about	eschewing protagonist	features,	yet	they	do	not	attempt	to	offer	up	a	puppet	any	more	than Briggs’s	Plundered	Hearts	does;	both	involve	desires,	refusals,	involuntary actions	and	so	forth.	Representations	of	internal	constraint	have	been	with	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">since	the	beginning.	Yet	their	misunderstanding	has	also	been	with	IF	since	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a>beginning,	in	the	routine	misreading	of	a	frequently	quoted	introductory	line from	the	ur-text	Adventure:	“I	will	be	your	eyes	and	hands.”	This	is	commonly misinterpreted	as	either	“This	puppet	will	be	your	eyes	and	hands”	or	“I,	the system,	will	give	you	this	puppet,	which	will	then	be	your	eyes	and	hands.”	But no.	We	must	read	it	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	his	recent	article	“Fretting	the	Player	Character,”	Nick	Montfort	puts	forth	a different	but	quite	interesting	suggestion	that	we	should	understand	the protagonist	(which	he	terms	the	“player	character”)	as	a	vessel,	like	a	ship, which	is	not	played,	but	“steered.”	Montfort	alludes	to	the	inspiration	for	this conceit,	which	is	worth	our	elaborating	here:	it	is	Norbert	Weiner’s	Cybernetics (1948),	the	title	being	a	neologism	that	used	the	Greek	Κυβερνήτης	or kybernetes	(“steersman”)	as	a	metaphor	for	“the	study	of	control	and communication	in	the	animal	and	the	machine.”	Like	the	steersman	whose governance	of	the	rudder	is	one	part	of	a	continuous	feedback	loop,	Weiner’s information	theory	considers	systems	(whether	physical,	biological,	or mechanical)	mathematically,	as	information	processes.	The	subsequently	named field	of	cybernetics	and	its	central	metaphor	of	the	steersman	physically	and expressively	united	with	his	ship	has	inspired	a	number	of	critical	theories	in	the humanities	and	arts,	including	Donna	Haraway’s	A	Cyborg	Manifesto:	Science, Technology,	and	Socialist-Feminism	in	the	Late	Twentieth	Century	(1991)	and, most	significantly	for	this	study,	Espen	Aarseth’s	Cybertext	(1997).	I	have critiqued	Cybertext	twice	in	this	study	for	being	insufficiently	cybernetic	�	that is,	neglecting	to	take	seriously	how	the	feedback	loop	requires	that	signals	pass through	cognition,	with	specific	consequences	for	our	models	of	how	the	total</p>
<p class="calibre1">“textual	machine”	functions.	Given	my	general	bias	towards	taking	feedback loops	seriously,	I’m	interested	in	Montfort’s	approach	to	a	cybernetic	vocabulary of	IF	interaction,	although	I	will	later	suggest	a	dramatic	vocabulary	as	more appropriate	and	productive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Montfort’s	concept	of	participation	in	the	work	begins	in	his	observation	of	an interesting	linguistic	phenomenon:</p>
<p class="calibre1">[It]	is	not	at	all	useful	to	consider	that	the	player	character	is	played	by	the interactor	in	any	literal,	typical	sense	of	play:	not	in	the	dramatic	sense,	not	in the	gaming	sense,	and	not	even	exactly	in	the	sense	of	many	other	multi-party roleplaying	contexts,	from	Dungeons	and	Dragons	to	multi-user	online environments.	[…]	I	enjoyed	playing	Monopoly”	but	it	would	be	strange	to	hear someone	say	“I	enjoyed	playing	the	car”	or	“I	enjoyed	playing	the	hat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>Similarly,	people	frequently	say	how	much	they	like	“playing	Zork,”	but	it	is unusual	to	hear	them	explain	how	much	they	got	out	of	“playing	the	nameless adventurer.”	Or,	if	that	seems	a	straw-adventurer	argument,	consider	that	they might	say	“I	enjoyed	playing	The	Hitchhiker’s	Guide	to	the	Galaxy,”	but	it would	be	much	more	unusual	to	hear	them	say	“I	enjoyed	playing	Arthur	Dent.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">(139)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Coming	on	the	heels	of	my	protest	that	protagonists	such	as	Arthur	Dent	are interlocutors,	rather	than	mere	puppets,	this	is	an	interesting	sociological observation:	interactors	describe	playing	works,	not	playing	player	characters.	I agree	that	there	is	in	fact	a	problem	with	the	idea	of	“playing	Arthur	Dent”	as thus	conceived,	and	the	suggested	alternative	“I	enjoyed	steering	Arthur	Dent” </p>
<p class="calibre1">has	two	advantages.	First,	it	is	more	likely	to	get	actual	use,	because	it	is	a	better description	of	the	experience.	Second,	it	is	less	odious,	because	the	roleplaying fallacy	Montfort	describes	is	another	angle	on	my	critique	of	puppet	theory	�</p>
<p class="calibre1">two	facets	of	a	larger	problem	in	which	critical	rhetoric	and	audience	expectation do	not	match	the	nature	of	the	medium.	Yet	I	disagree	in	part	with	Montfort’s solution,	again	based	on	the	level	at	which	it	operates.	The	interactor	does	not steer	the	player	character.	She	steers	the	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	say	that	the	interactor	steers	the	work,	I	mean	this	in	part	in	a	technical sense,	correctly	extending	Weiner’s	original	metaphor:	the	interactor	is	a	part	of a	feedback	loop	with	the	work	of	IF	as	a	whole,	only	part	of	which	is	the protagonist.	The	protagonist	is	at	best	the	helm	of	this	total	helmsman-ship-ocean-wind	system,	but	in	fact	is	more	precisely	like	the	rudder,	to	which	the helm	of	the	command	line	is	primarily	connected,	yet	pinioned	to	the	hull	of	the work’s	state.	Yet	this	metaphor	(already	too	complex	compared	to	the	elegance of	Montfort’s	formulation)	also	breaks	down,	because	a	steersman	plotting	a course	is	a	vivid	example	of	the	operation	of	continuous	feedback	in	general (like	the	anti-aircraft	gun	research	that	originally	inspired	Weiner),	but	a	poor analogy	for	how	feedback	works	in	IF.	I	may	be	being	unnecessarily	fastidious on	this	point.	The	belief	that	protagonists	(rather	than	works)	are	cybernetically controlled	is	a	welcome	complication	of	puppet	theories	(it	introduces negotiation	and	compromise),	yet	“steer”	retains	that	misleadingly	visceral physical	metaphor	(hand	on	helm),	and	the	sense	that	compromises	in	the	course of	the	occupied	vessel	(still	empty,	like	the	puppet)	are	only	with	forces	external to	the	vessel	(wind,	currents).	Some	protagonists	are	hard	to	steer,	but	I	would argue	that	their	reticence	against	certain	courses	(e.g.	the	traveler	in	Shade’s unwillingness	to	turn	off	the	light	or	open	the	door)	is	constitutive,	and	a	good</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>thing.	Are	there	ships	that	handle	awkwardly,	erratically,	or	reluctantly,	not (switching	to	the	parlance	of	programming)	as	a	bug,	but	as	a	feature?	If,	as	I suspect,	there	are	not,	then	the	metaphor	of	steerage	is	failing	us	for	IF,	because it	encourages	us	to	devalue	artful	work	precisely	to	the	extent	it	is	artful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet	steering	is	a	far	more	plausible	term	than	extending	my	id	metaphor	to common	use.	“I	enjoyed	urging	Arthur	Dent”	or	“I	enjoyed	inspiring	Arthur Dent”	sounds	ridiculous,	and	it	lacks	a	key	advantage	of	steer-speak:	a	great number	of	normal	interactions	in	many	IF	works	involve	acts	of	compass-rose navigation	(N,	S,	E,	W)	or	simple	direction,	a	sense	that	‘steer’	reflects.	Further, explicitly	treating	the	protagonist	as	a	vessel	is	a	recognizable	trope.	Michael Berlyn’s	Suspended	(1983)	and	Paul	O’Brian’s	L.A.S.H.	�	Local	Asynchronous Satellite	Hookup	(2000)	both	put	the	interactor	in	charge	of	robots	to	great effect,	in	part	because	controlling	a	robot	is	experientially	continuous	with	many basic	IF	designs,	in	part	because	both	works	complicate	that	idea	of	steerage.	Yet this	whole	discussion	of	how	interactors	describe	protagonist	control	may	be	a solution	in	search	of	a	problem.	Just	as	cybernetics	maps	better	onto	steerage	of the	IF	work	than	of	the	protagonist,	Montfort	has	already	observed	that	most interactors	(like	most	game	players,	and	perhaps	for	similar	or	culturally continuous	reasons)	already	describe	playing	the	work	rather	than	the protagonist,	and	in	this	they	are	correctly	describing	their	true	engagement;	there is	no	need	to	dissuade	them	from	this	practice.	The	verb	is	fine	as	far	as	it	goes, but	misses	the	main	point	of	confusion:	we	must	also	develop	a	better description	of	the	figure	that	focalizes	identification	and	acts	as	a	locus	of agency. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beyond	“exchang[ing]	the	flawed	idea	that	the	player	character	is	played	with the	idea,	perhaps	less	or	at	least	differently	flawed,	that	the	player	character	is steered”	(141),	as	Montfort	suggests,	I’d	suggest	really	“fretting	the	player character.”	The	term	“player	character”	is	itself	wrong,	and	rather	than redefining	it	in	cybernetic	terms	we	should	replace	it	with	one	that	better	reflects the	ambivalent	complexities	of	IF	identification.	This	suggested	renaming	might be	a	self-contradiction,	as	I	strenuously	defend	the	use	of	the	phrase	“interactive fiction”	based	in	part	on	popular	use	(Ch.	1)	but	here	resist	the	term	“player character,”	which	also	has	a	strong	(if	less	universal)	consensus	in	practical	use. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet	the	situation	is	not	exactly	the	same.	First,	“player	character”	is	a	specific term	of	craft	or	criticism,	and	thus	bears	a	certain	responsibility	for	accuracy (and	carries	a	certain	consequence	for	inaccuracy)	which	genre	labels	do	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Terms	of	craft	are	also	easier	to	change.	Second,	the	term	“player	character” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>strongly	implies	that	the	player	is	embodied	by	her	character,	or	that	the	player character	is	occupied	by	the	player.	They	term	also	implies	that	IF	works	(which may	be	played,	used,	read,	interacted	with,	explored,	tested,	and	so	forth)	are always	played,	which	is	particularly	strange	in	relation	to	conversational	or	art show	pieces,	but	generally	limiting	in	even	more	conventional	cases.	Third,	and most	importantly,	by	implying	that	the	player	character	stands	in	for	the	player, the	term	implicitly	conflates	focalization	(how	the	interactor	perceives	the diegesis)	with	action	(how	the	interactor	affects	the	diegesis).	In	IF,	these	two	are commonly	but	not	necessarily	the	same.	Indeed,	several	interesting	works experiment	with	this	difference	(see	Ch.	4),	while	much	of	the	current	research in	IF	architecture	explores	decoupling	focalization	from	action	at	the	system level.	For	this	reason,	I	identify	the	figure	through	which	interactor	agency	is focalized	as	the	“protagonist,”	or	first	actor:	one	who	usually	performs	the interactor’s	suggested	acts.	It	might	literally	follow	that	multiple	such	figures	(as in	Berlyn’s	Suspended	or	Granade’s	Common	Ground)	are	“agonists,”	but	for the	sake	of	elegance	we	can	simply	call	them	“actors”:	characters	who	perform the	suggested	acts	of	the	interactor.	Figures	who	are	not	conduits	of	agency therefore	need	not	be	called	“non-player	characters”	(NPCs).	They	are	simply</p>
<p class="calibre1">“characters,”	and	describing	them	in	this	way	helps	us	to	consider	the	many complex	ways	in	which	characters	may	be	partial	or	contingent	actors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	shall	we	call	the	passing	of	potentially	ambiguous	commands	via	the command	line	to	an	actor?	Direction.	For	example:	“I	enjoyed	directing	Ford Prefect	more	than	Arthur	Dent.	I	directed	Trillian	south,	but	then	she	wouldn’t do	anything	I	directed	her	to	do.”	This	sounds	about	right	to	my	ears,	although my	assumption	is	that	most	interactors	will	continue	saying	“I	enjoyed	playing Hitchhiker’s	Guide	to	the	Galaxy.”	In	more	technical	discussions	such	as	hints, walkthroughs,	and	IF	criticism,	“direction”	could	catch	on,	however.	Instead	of confusing	and	bizarre	descriptions	such	as	“Hit	Mrs.	Robner	three	times,	and	on the	third	time	you	try	to	hit	her	you	will	actually	hit	her,”	an	IF	reviewer	might use	a	clearer	description:	“Direct	the	detective	to	hit	Mrs.	Robner.	He’ll	refuse	at first,	but	insist,	after	the	third	direction	he	will	do	it.”	The	stem	“direct”	is simple,	extremely	flexible,	and	need	not	connote	that	the	interactor	is	the dramatic	director	or	auteur	of	the	total	work,	just	that	she	directs	what	is	given	to her	to	direct. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	may	be	merely	serendipitous	that	this	formulation	for	linguistic specification	of	action	also	strongly	implies	the	traditional	IF	convention	of compass	direction.	It	is	deeply	logical,	however,	that	“direction”	correctly</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a>describes	the	most	common	way	the	command	line	has	been	used	to	indirect action	among	multiple	characters:	giving	directions	to	others.	The	protagonist	is the	first	actor,	through	whom	agency	is	primarily	focalized,	but	may	be	only	the first	of	many	such	actors.	There	is	another	common	form	of	secondary	agency: the	ability	to	pass	on	commands	to	other	characters.	Here	are	some	fanciful examples	to	demonstrate	the	syntax,	taken	from	the	manuals	for	Zork	I:</p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;UNCLE	OTTO,	GIVE	ME	YOUR	WALLET</p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;MIGHTY	WIZARD,	TAKE	THIS	POISONED	APPLE.	EAT	IT</p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;BOY,	RUN	HOME	THEN	CALL	THE	POLICE</p>
<p class="calibre1">Under	the	old	terminology	I	propose	retiring,	the	boy	is	an	NPC	�	that	is,	any entity	that	is	not	the	interactor’s	“eyes	and	hands.”	This	is	not	a	helpful description	from	the	point	of	view	of	an	interactor,	however.	What	is	important about	the	boy	is	that,	unlike	many	characters	who	do	not	accept	commands,	this character	is	also	an	actor:	a	conduit	for	action	who	may	be	given	commands (messages,	passed	to	him	via	the	protagonist)	which	he	may	then	attempt	to parse	and	act	on,	affecting	the	state	of	the	simulation.	Whether	or	not	he	at	some point	becomes	the	protagonist	(that	is,	the	work	is	focalized	through	him	and BOY,	TAKE	THIS	APPLE	can	instead	be	stated	TAKE	THE	APPLE)	his abilities	and	constraints	are	part	of	how	the	interactor	may	steer	the	work;	he	is one	of	the	work’s	actors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IF	and	genre	fiction:	beyond	generic	scripting</p>
<p class="calibre1">We	have	come	a	long	way	since	addressing	Sloane’s	puppet	critique.	Our	new vocabulary	for	IF	instead	describes	how	protagonists	are	directed.	This vocabulary	better	reflects	the	actual	aesthetic	history	of	the	genre,	and	better elucidates	how	the	limits	of	directing	protagonists	form	the	core	problematic	of contemporary	IF	design.	IF	will	not	and	indeed	cannot	completely	eliminate	the distance	between	an	interactor	and	the	protagonist	that	she	directs,	any	more than	it	can	eliminate	the	distance	between	the	interactor	and	the	work.	This distance	is	inherent	in	the	fact	of	language	at	the	command	line.	Indeed,	the challenge	for	IF	today	is	not	to	close	the	gap	as	far	as	possible,	but	to	open	it	up and	truly	explore	the	possibilities	of	that	space.	The	corollary	to	this	challenge	is exploring	the	gap	in	ways	that	are	enfranchising,	inviting	the	interactor	as	a participant	into	the	rules,	laws,	or	codes	that	govern	the	standing	point	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a>protagonist	she	directs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	recalls	Murray’s	oft-cited	lesson	from	Zork	that	“the	first	step	in	making an	enticing	narrative	world	is	to	script	the	interactor”	(79).	She	connects	this lesson	by	example	to	the	powerful	expectation-framing	forces	of	“genre	fiction” </p>
<p class="calibre1">that	we	are	calling	generic	tropes.	Murray’s	focus	is	not	primarily	on	how	to accommodate	failure	during	interaction	(frustration	aesthetics,	or	the	art	of	error message	design)	but	rather	how	to	anticipate	and	strongly	frame	expectations before	interaction,	heading-off	potential	errors	which	are	conceptually	excluded from	the	problem	space.	Generic	tropes	provide	a	widely	recognized	and	easily understood	set	of	interaction	scripts	that	minimize	the	likelihood	of	a	mismatch between	interactor	expectations	and	authorial	anticipations.	For	Murray,	the challenge	to	find	“a	wider	range	of	behavior	than	treasure	hunting	and	troll slaughter”	is	in	part	a	problem	born	of	success.	IF	successfully	uses	stereotypes to	promote	successful	interaction,	but	this	risks	making	IF	a	producer	of	only stereotypical	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	at	this	point	over-generalizing	Murray’s	observations	(who	is	herself generally	up-beat	on	the	potential	for	Hamlet-like	new	media)	to	make	a	larger point	about	our	general	thinking	in	new	media	about	expectation	and	frustration in	regards	to	interaction.	If	we	assume	that	the	goal	of	the	design	space	is	to conform	to	strongly	understood,	previously	available	schema	and	scripts	about interaction,	then	we	have	in	the	process	implicitly	stated	that	IF	can	never	be accessible	or	usable	on	the	one	hand	while	still	being	unexpected,	surprising,	or unique	on	the	other.	We	are	arguing	instead	that	the	pattern	of	being	unsurprising is	what	causes	interaction	design	to	succeed.	To	restate,	accepting	the	hallmark of	successful	IF	design	as	“reinforcing	genre	expectations”	might	also	be positing	good	IF	design	as	the	antithesis	of	“subverting	genre	expectations.”	To complete	the	syllogism:	if	subversion	is	a	hallmark	of	artful	literature,	and	the truly	generic	tropes	are	the	opposite	of	subversion,	does	this	mean	that	IF	is	in this	sense	the	opposite	of	artful	literature? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet	it	is	not	the	case	that	good	IF	design	is	always	based	on	generic expectation.	First,	the	interactor	may	be	scripted	(as	Murray’s	formula	allows)	at any	time,	whether	before	or	during	interaction.	During	interaction,	that	script may	change,	sometimes	dramatically,	as	we	see	when	the	lethargic	traveler	of Shade	rapidly	shifts	in	the	second	act	into	the	manic	destroyer	of	her	apartment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scripting	is	reinforcing,	subverting,	and	playing	with	expectation,	and	this	is	a process.	There	is	also	nothing	to	say	that	we	should	script	the	interactor	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a>succeed.	It	may	be	more	interesting	to	script	the	interactor’s	failure	(as	9:05	and Bad	Machine	both	demonstrate	in	very	different	ways).	In	fact,	given	the	nature of	the	command	line,	it	may	be	vital	to	script	failure,	as	the	gap	(in understanding,	in	communication,	in	resolution)	is	the	most	consistently	likely condition	of	any	work.	Failure	is	the	assumed	default	scenario,	and	as	such	it seems	a	modest	proposal	to	script	failure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	continuing	on	this	thread,	however,	I’d	like	to	address	a	problem	when Murray’s	useful	formulation	is	over-generalized,	reinforcing	a	general misimpression	that	most	IF	works	(or	most	commercial	IF	works	of	the	1970s and	1980s)	were	generic	fictions.	In	other	words,	we	need	to	be	careful	that	the myth	of	a	“bygone	commercial	golden	era	of	IF”	(Ch.	1)	not	be	replaced	by	an equally	unhelpful	myth	of	an	“unimaginative	genre	fiction	era	of	IF.”	For example,	here	is	Aarseth	on	IF	genre:</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	formula	was	simple:	take	a	popular	fiction	genre,	for	example,	the detective	novel,	[and]	create	a	background	story	(the	more	stereotypical	the better,	since	the	players	would	need	less	initiation)	[…].	(Aarseth,	100) Aarseth	may	be	being	a	bit	flippant	about	‘formula’	here,	as	he	does	not	claim all	IF	are	necessarily	formulaic,	but	rather	implies	most	IF	are	broadly	formulaic in	leading	up	to	a	specific	work:	Blank’s	Deadline.	As	a	stereotypical	murder investigated	by	a	stereotypical	detective,	Deadline	arguably	fits	Aarseth’s framing	statement.	Still,	Aarseth’s	description	of	stereotyping	as	a	general	or pervasive	design	formula	can	serve	as	an	explicit	example	of	the	problem	we might	encounter	in	generalizing	Murray’s	line	of	thinking	to	an	incorrect	view	of IF	history.	It	gives	the	impression	that	the	best	known,	top	selling,	or	most significant	works	of	the	era	were	straight	generic	fictions	with	stereotypical background	stories,	none	of	which	is	true.	As	discussed	in	Ch.	1,	contemporary IF	is	not	aesthetically	insignificant	or	technically	unsophisticated	as	a	result	of being	primarily	noncommercial;	it	is	not	somehow	“fallen”	from	the	heights	of	a bygone	commercial	era,	whether	by	the	fact	of	defunding	or	by	nature	of	its technical	obsolescence.	Conversely,	commercial	era	IF	was	not	primitive	or aesthetically	simple	generic	fiction,	whether	by	virtue	of	its	status	as	a	product	in the	computer	games	market	or	by	nature	of	its	command	line	mode	of interactivity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murray	specifically	identifies	a	very	useful	but	minor	design	pattern	in	IF	�</p>
<p class="calibre1">using	genre	tropes	to	frame	expectation	�	which	was	neither	innate	nor</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a>unusually	dominant.	Arguably,	like	the	novels,	film,	and	television	of	the	1980s, much	of	the	total	commercial	output	of	IF	was	generic	fictions,	and	a	great	deal of	that	output	was	workmanlike.	But	we	would	be	mistaken	in	going	any	further, linking	an	audience	standing	point	or	medium	(e.g.	interacting	at	the	command line)	to	generic	tropes	as	a	necessary	or	foundational	aesthetic	strategy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	going	further	theoretically,	let’s	look	at	specific	examples.	The foundational	work	of	the	era	is	Adventure,	and	its	three	best-known	commercial descendants	are	Adventureland,	Zork	I,	and	Acheton,	all	of	whose	back-stories are	non-existent	(rather	than	stereotypical)	and	whose	mood	and	collection	of tropes	are	unique	unto	itself.	None	of	these	works	have	the	content	or	the	tone either	of	a	straight	adaptation	of	Tolkien	(which	is	primarily	sonorous	and pastoral).	Nor	do	they	resemble	straight	adaptations	of	Dungeons	&amp;	Dragons (which	emphasizes	the	grim	elements	of	the	forgoing).	Adventure	is	fantasy	to the	extent	that	it	contains	magic,	yet	it	is	not	high	fantasy,	as	it	also	contains	a bricolage	of	anachronisms,	absurdities,	and	techno-archaeology	quite	particular to	the	IF	cavern-crawl.	Some	of	this	unique	tone	and	content	could	be	attributed to	the	original	tone	of	Crowther	or	the	interests	of	Woods.	Some	might	reflect the	tendency	of	most	multiple	authorships	to	create	pastiche	as	a	byproduct	of their	activities.	Some	might	be	particular	to	cultural	milieu	specific	to	1970s ARPANET,	both	the	particular	references	and	general	sense	of	humor	that	make up	its	“folk	tradition.”	Regardless,	a	novelization	or	film	adaptation	of Adventure	(if	such	a	thing	could	be	contemplated)	would	resemble	Terry Gilliam’s	Time	Bandits	more	than	any	genre-typical	fantasy	or	adventure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cavern-crawl	IF	works	are	raucous	�	not	for	nothing	does	Buckles	identify them	with	folk	art	as	in	an	oral	culture	�	and	we	can	confirm	this	in	them	at every	turn.	Being	an	adventurer	on	an	adventure	does	not	reliably	exclude	the gestures	of	comedies,	fairy	tales,	or	romances:	it	merely	interwingles	them,	as	in the	first	interpersonal	moment	in	Zork:</p>
<p class="calibre1">A	nasty-looking	troll,	brandishing	a	bloody	axe,	blocks	all	passages	out	of	the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	KISS	TROLL</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	sooner	kiss	a	pig. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ultimately,	however,	the	entire	idea	of	genre	fiction	(in	which	systematic audience	knowledge	of	the	genre	precedes	the	fiction)	is	a	poor	match	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a>cavern-crawl	works,	which	built	a	culture	around	the	creation	of	the	genre	in	the form	of	the	original	work.	Is	The	Rocky	Horror	Picture	Show	genre	fiction	if everyone	in	the	audience	can	anticipate	the	lines?	This	seems	like	a misapplication	of	the	idea	of	intertextual	familiarity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	if	foundational	works	were	complex,	were	top-selling	commercial	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">works	stereotypical	generic	fictions?	The	most	distributed	IF	work	of	all	time was	Veronika	Megler	and	Philip	Mitchell’s	1982	adaptation	of	J.R.R.	Tolkien’s The	Hobbit	for	Melbourne	House,	a	work	that,	while	high	fantasy,	was	an adaptation	of	a	single	unique	and	highly	recognizable	work.	Many	copies actually	came	bundled	with	Tolkien’s	text	(Maher	91).	This	bundling	was	the single	densest	and	most	comprehensive	paratext	even	in	IF,	and	possibly	the largest	in	eliterature	or	new	media	as	well,	literally	“scripting	the	interactor”	but in	a	concrete	rather	than	an	abstract	or	generic	way.	The	second	most	widely distributed	commercial	IF	work	was	Steve	Meretzky’s	1984	adaptation	along with	Douglas	Adams	of	that	author’s	The	Hitchhiker’s	Guide	to	the	Galaxy	�	a genre-defying	intergalactic	absurdist	screwball	black	comedy	with	a	similarly complex	paratextual	background	for	each	of	the	four	directed	characters.	Again, these	works	might	certainly	be	said	to	script	the	interactor	in	Murray’s	specific sense,	but	hardly	in	relation	to	a	formula	with	the	most	generic	characters	and back-story	possible.	Neither	work	was	notably	tractable	without	at	least	some familiarity	with	the	print	works,	one	reason	why	Randall	chooses	to	exclude	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">literary	adaptations	from	his	consideration	of	artful	IF. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Were	some	of	the	best	known	or	most	critically	acclaimed	IF	works	of	the commercial	era	generic	fictions?	Robert	Pinsky’s	Mindwheel	received significant	press	coverage,	and	the	work’s	tropes	are	located	more	in	an	avant-garde	mix	of	high-and	postmodernism	than	in	the	popular,	which	is	to	say	that	it synthesizes	many	generic	tropes	into	unrecognizability	and	makes	hash	of interactor	preconceptions.	Even	many	of	the	most	celebrated	works	of	Infocom’s commercial	catalog	are	not	stereotypical	in	their	frames	or	back-stories.	In	a 1984	interview,	Implementer	(i.e.	author	 <i class="calibre3">designer	</i> programmer)	Michael	Berlyn expressed	this	hybrid	relationship:</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	one	sense	we	are	working	within	traditional	genres	�	mystery,	fantasy, science	fiction	�	and	in	another	we	are	still	teaching	ourselves,	laying	out	the groundwork	for	what	these	things	could	be.	For	the	most	part,	we	are	working without	pioneers.	(Maher,	45)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a>Michael	Berlyn	and	Patricia	Fogleman’s	Infidel	(1983)	is	in	fact	a	brilliant example	of	this	midpoint	between	framing	expectation	and	its	reversal,	as	it scripts	an	Adventure-like	(or	Indiana	Jones-like)	archaeologist-adventurer looting	a	tomb,	but	with	a	difference;	the	interactor	/	protagonist	is	ultimately	the villain,	and	victory	is	ultimately	defeat.	Infidel	should	be	a	required	text	for	any critique	of	generic	trope	use	in	early	IF,	particularly	any	ideological	critiques	of the	kleptomaniacal	adventurer	figure	of	Adventure.	As	is	often	the	case,	such critique	first	arose	from	within. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Infocom’s	marketing	may	have	exacerbated	the	perception	of	IF	as	generic fiction	with	its	1984	decision	to	distribute	all	works	using	standardized	labels:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“fantasy,”	“mystery,”	“science	fiction,”	and	“tales	of	adventure.”	However,	as Maher	points	out,	these	labeling	practices	were	eventually	rescinded	in	later printed	catalogs	and	omitted	from	the	covers	of	later	packaged	editions.	This may	have	been	because	the	terms	obfuscated	rather	than	clarified	the	product’s nature:	“Brian	Moriarty’s	mournful	atomic	age	tragedy	Trinity,	for	instance,	was arbitrarily	given	the	label	of	fantasy	even	though	it	bore	little	relation	to	what	the average	consumer	might	think	of	when	hearing	that	label”	(46-47).	The	same holds	true	for	many	other	Infocom	works.	Protagonist	Perry	Simm’s	discovery	at age	20	that	he	is	a	computer	simulation	hardly	gives	Meretzky’s	A	Mind	Forever Voyaging	a	stereotypical	back	story,	while	the	work’s	uses	of	science	fiction elements	(a	simulated	American	town	visited	over	five	decades	as	a	critique	of domestic	political	policies)	remains	remarkably	singular.	Berlyn’s	Suspended,	by contrast,	seems	like	a	traditional	work	of	science	fiction	in	conception.	It features	a	collection	of	robots	with	different	characteristics	and	perceptions	of the	world,	a	description	which	on	its	face	recalls	large	portions	of	Isaac Asimov’s	classic	short	story	collection	I,	Robot	(1950).	Yet	in	its	presentation, Suspended	is	focalized	through	these	alien	others	and	their	unique	and sometimes	disorienting	perceptions,	a	perspective	consistently	denied	to Asimov’s	human	investigators	and	more	typical	of	high-concept	writing	like	the Benjy	Compson	passages	of	Faulkner’s	The	Sound	and	the	Fury.	If	A	Mind Forever	Voyaging	and	Suspended	are	singular	science	fictions,	Brian	Moriarty’s Wishbringer	(1985)	is	likewise	a	singular	fantasy	�	a	bizarre	comedic	synthesis of	a	quaint	1980s	town	(during	the	day)	with	a	nightmare	kingdom	(at	night).	A typical	interaction	in	Wishbringer	involves	outwitting	a	magically	possessed mailbox.	As	the	interactor	tries	to	understand	her	motivation	and	find	her	place in	the	work,	she	must	do	it	through	a	protagonist	postal	clerk	who	promised	a stranger	to	help	find	her	cat.	One	fairly	unlikely	reaction	is	“Oh,	THAT	old stereotype	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a>My	purpose	here	is	not	to	argue	that	the	prominent	IF	works	of	the	1980s merely	have	singular	characteristics	and	should	not	be	oversimplified	or underestimated.	That	protest	can	be	raised	for	any	beloved	work	of	art.	My purpose	instead	is	to	provoke	a	re-examination	of	the	1980s	commercial	canon, which	I	suggest	has	a	deeply	complex	relationship	in	its	implementation	to	the idea	of	generic	tropes	as	devices	that	frame	expectations.	These	specific	critical examinations	are	the	ultimate	test	of	whether	IF	was	founded	in	generic formulae,	but	I	submit	that	this	is	highly	unlikely.	Even	in	the	most	stereotypical and	hackneyed	of	IF,	the	framing	story	of	a	work	can	only	script	interaction	so far	from	the	top	down.	The	rest	of	frustration	must	be	designed	for	from	the bottom	up.	Because	IF	must	anticipate	generic-subversion	on	the	part	of	the protagonist,	it	must	acknowledge	transgressions	in	disallowing	them,	or otherwise	incorporate	transgressions	into	an	expanded	and	always-troubled	idea of	generic	tropes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IF	dysfunction:	beyond	autism	and	objectivism</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	if	we	grant	that	neither	the	protagonist-as-puppet	nor	the	genre-as-script will	resolve	away	the	frustrating	gaps	that	are	inherent	to	the	way	IF	is	artful,	we have	still	not	fully	addressed	Sloane’s	objections,	which	are	clearly	visceral	but also	carefully	articulated:</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	frustration	that	you	the	reader	and	the	“you”	in	the	text	do	not	concur	as far	as	actions	taken,	sentences	spoken,	or	choices	available	is	a	frustration compounded	by	a	parser’s	limited	understandings	of	the	reader’s	typed commands.	(73-74)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Given	the	limitations	of	the	parser	(and	the	limitations	of	the	simulation	or world	model,	that	is,	the	limitations	of	the	finitely	available	textual	productions of	an	individual	IF	work)	how	is	the	interactor	to	relate	to	the	protagonist	and her	limited	world	view,	even	once	those	are	acknowledged	as	allowably	separate from	a	puppet	standing-point?	One	highly	suggestive	(but	slightly	confused) recurrent	tope	in	IF	criticism	and	commentary	has	been	the	metaphor	of	autism, a	congenital	mental	condition	characterized	by	“great	difficulty	in communicating	and	forming	relationships	with	other	people	and	in	using language	and	abstract	concepts.”	Sloane’s	descriptions	of	her	frustrations	with Deadline	characters	could	be	read	as	suggestive	of	autism,	although	she	certainly never	characterizes	it	as	such.	In	his	reading,	Aarseth	dubs	Deadline	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Autistic	Detective	Agency,”	quoting	at	length	a	definition:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a>“a	neurobiological	disorder	that	affects	physical,	social,	and	language	skills</p>
<p class="calibre1">[…]	it	may	be	characterized	by	meaninglessness,	noncontextual	echolalia (constant	repetition	of	what	is	said	by	others)	or	the	replacement	of	speech	by strange	mechanical	sounds.	Inappropriate	attachment	to	objects	may	occur.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">(115)</p>
<p class="calibre1">For	Aarseth,	this	quote	is	evocative	rather	than	descriptive	in	a	clinical	sense, and	indeed	we	can	see	it	is	hardly	an	exact	fit.	The	range	of	suggested dysfunctions	maps	in	part	onto	the	characters	of	Deadline,	and	in	part	onto	the protagonist	detective.	Yet	the	characters	repeat	themselves,	rather	than	exhibiting echolalia,	while	the	detective	is	preoccupied	with	the	accumulating	potential evidence	from	around	the	murder	scene	�	perhaps	a	form	of	attachment	to objects,	but	not	entirely	inappropriate	to	his	vocation	and	situation.	For	Aarseth, autism	is	in	the	end	only	a	metaphor	for	generalized	unnatural	dysfunction:	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">“contract	between	user	and	text”	in	IF	is	“a	willing	suspension	of	one’s	normal capacity	for	language,	physical	aptness,	and	social	interaction	as	well”	(116-117). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	context	of	the	present	study	we	can	restate	this	much	more	precisely:	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">works	exhibit	a	quality	of	language	dysfunction	(communication	failure)	that	is	a byproduct	of	command	line	/	parser	architecture.	This	problem	for	the	interactor communicating	with	the	parser	is	focalized	into	(but	not	entirely	exclusive	to) the	problem	of	communicating	with	the	protagonist,	with	the	subsequent	(and secondary)	consequences	that	the	separate	protagonist	is	not	as	physically	or socially	versatile	as	the	interactor	might	be	in	the	same	situation,	often	due	to inability	to	understand	her.	This	is	in	part	a	problem	of	ambiguity,	but	only	in part.	Communication	failures	will	abound	because	the	world	of	the	work	must always	be	fundamentally	incomplete,	hence	limited	and	constrained.	This manifests	itself	in	all	manner	of	social,	cultural,	and	practical	ignorance.	The work	is	our	linguistic	interlocutor,	and	it	(not	we)	is	inappropriately	limited, requiring	us	to	become	likewise	limited	in	discovering	our	agency	within	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aarseth’s	quotation	“inappropriate	attachment	to	objects”	is	also	provocative. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	specific	sense	of	“obsession	with	taking”	that	he	uses	it,	it	suggests	a critique	of	the	kleptomaniacal	adventurer.	In	a	more	general	sense	the	phrase recalls	Sloane’s	intense	dislike	of	“objectivism.”	Indeed,	we	might	productively re-imagine	the	critique	of	“objectivism,”	not	as	a	critique	of	narrow	perspective, but	as	a	critique	of	“inappropriate	attachment	to	objects.”	IF	works	might	be objectivist,	not	only	because	they	are	fundamentally	incomplete	(as	is	any</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a>limited	representation	one	may	explore	or	interrogate),	but	also	because	they	are discrete.	Works	of	IF	are	made	up	of	objects	whose	object-ness	introduces myriad	missing	gaps	that	the	interactor	might	reference,	but	cannot:	ropes	that cannot	be	cut	into	strings	and	then	woven	into	knots,	glasses	of	water	that	cannot be	sprinkled	one	drop	at	a	time	across	the	landscape,	planks	that	cannot	be simultaneously	situated	in	two	rooms	via	a	connecting	doorway,	and	so	forth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	concepts,	these	objects	are	often	indivisible	or	infinite.	This	speculation goes	beyond	the	bounds	of	Sloane’s	work,	so	let	us	call	this	attachment	to objects	not	objectivism	but	Platonic	simulation,	which	in	most	IF	languages	and works	involves	the	manipulation	of	the	database	aspect	of	the	simulation	known as	the	“object	tree.”	As	Roger	Firth	and	Sonja	Kesserich	describe	it	to	potential Inform	6	programmers	in	The	Inform	Beginner’s	Guide: Not	only	is	your	game	composed	entirely	of	objects,	but	also	Inform	takes great	care	to	keep	track	of	the	relationships	between	those	objects.	By</p>
<p class="calibre1">“relationships”	we	don’t	mean	that	Walter	is	Wilhelm’s	son,	while	Helga	and Wilhelm	are	just	good	friends;	it	is	a	much	more	comprehensive	exercise	in recording	exactly	where	each	object	is	located,	relative	to	other	objects	in	the game.	(44)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	specific	form	of	object	tree	simulation	resembles	all	simulations	in	that the	fundamental	underlying	reality	of	the	simulation	must	be	addressed	in	order for	the	simulation	to	be	changed.	These	objects	have	names,	which	can	be invoked	to	effect.	In	this	sense,	just	as	IF	protagonists	are	limited,	in	that	they have	a	code-superego	which	is	distinct	from	the	interactor,	so	too	is	the	IF	world limited,	in	that	like	any	representation	it	reflects	a	worldview,	a	description	of what	things	are	important,	what	actions	are	possible,	and	how	things	do	and	do not	relate.	Note	that	the	addressability	of	experience	in	terms	of	objects	(Platonic simulationism)	is	quite	different	from	making	an	assertion	that	the	addressable objects	of	experience	transcend	that	experience	and	represent	a	universal	truth (Objectivism).	In	order	to	influence	this	world,	the	interactor	must	interrogate and	come	into	an	understanding	of	the	particular	worldview	that	grants	a corresponding	ability	to	perceive	what	things	are	important	and	how	they interrelate.

Instead,	you	winnow	it	down	to	the	objects you’ll	actually	need,	plus	a	bit	of	scenery.	In	other	words,	the	author	does	for	the player	what	the	autistic	person	is	incapable	of	doing	for	himself.	No	wonder there	seems	to	be	a	disproportionate	number	of	autistic-spectrum	folk	in	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">fandom:	it	must	be	wonderful	to	wander	around	a	virtual	world	where surroundings	can	be	completely	apprehended	without	being	overwhelming (which	isn’t	guaranteed	even	for	graphical	adventures). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	throw	in	the	fact	that,	yes,	other	characters	generally	don’t	speak	unless spoken	to,	and	when	they	do	speak,	stay	on	point.	They	don’t	make	small	talk, don’t	look	at	you	expectantly,	and	in	the	very	rare	cases	that	their	facial expressions	are	important,	those	expressions	are	translated	into	words.	Throw	in the	fact	that	there	are	usually	clear	goals,	the	fact	that	everything	operates according	to	a	set	of	rules	that	can	be	deduced,	and	that	those	rules	can	be synthesized	into	a	strategy	for	achieving	those	goals.	So	it’s	not	just	that	the characters	in	IF	appear	to	be	autistic	�	it’s	that	the	medium	is	geared	towards the	preferences	of	the	autist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cadre’s	reference	to	“autistic-spectrum”	reflects	a	general	shift	in	recent medical	thinking	about	autism,	and	a	corresponding	social	shift	in	the	idea	that symptoms	such	as	“inappropriate	attachment	to	objects”	�	or	to	abstractions, Platonic	forms,	or	ideal	forms	�	might	be	congenital	traits	with	mild	to	severe consequences	for	socialization.	The	conjunction	of	this	general	non-medical discourse	about	genetically	occurring	aesthetic	preference	with	computer programming	and	geek	culture	is	probably	not	coincidental.	The	idea	of	autism-spectrum	behaviors	can	be	used	to	describe	a	cause	(or	perhaps	an	effect)	of	an external	vantage	point	on	socialization	with	which	geeks	are	all	too	familiar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	contemplating	the	categorization	of	one’s	temperament	(e.g.	the	Keirsey Temperament	Sorter),	or	like	contemplating	the	disposition	of	one’s	humors, contemplating	one’s	autistic-spectrum	position	can	provide	a	prime	cause	for everything	from	one’s	career	to	one’s	tastes	in	art.	I’m	generally	skeptical	of	the formulation	that	a	medium,	genre,	or	form	of	entertainment	(e.g.	novels,	IF)	is</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a>sought	out	by	a	specific	subset	of	the	population	predisposed	to	escaping	some aspect	of	reality	(e.g.	women,	autistics).	This	sounds	too	much	like	the	critiques of	escapist	subcultures	that	have	been	applied	over	and	over	to	novel	readers, arcade	patrons,	console	game	players,	and	so	forth.	But	let’s	follow	the discussion	through	first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	his	post	“Player	Freedom,”	IF	author	Stephen	Bond	echoes	Cadre’s	escapist formulation,	although	he	identifies	the	interactor’s	standing	point	not	with	a needed	respite	from	complexity,	but	a	fantasy	of	freedom	from	constraint: You	don’t	have	to	get	bogged	down	in	someone	else’s	story,	someone	else’s opinions,	someone	else’s	life;	all	that	matters	is	what	you	do	with	the	objects	at hand;	you	can	decide	on	a	story	yourself,	if	you	want	to.	You	don’t	have	to	care about	someone	else’s	vision	of	the	world;	you	can	fill	it	all	in	with	your	own imagination,	if	you	have	one.	With	a	poem	or	a	novel	or	a	newspaper	article,	you have	to	grapple	in	some	way	with	the	person	who	wrote	it,	but	there	is	no	such problem	with	the	perfect	text	adventure.	For	the	socially	disadvantaged,	it	makes ideal	reading	material:	the	author	is	there	only	to	offer	the	barest	framework	for the	imagination,	through	which	the	player	can	wander	freely,	alone	and uninhibited,	creating	and	destroying	at	will.	I’m	not	attempting	an	ad	hoc psychiatric	diagnosis	of	IF	fans.	But	I	think	IF	�	and	“interactive”	art	in	general</p>
<p class="calibre1">�	does	appeal	to	a	certain	autistic	tendency	that	has	become	more	prominent	in society. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	own	view	is	that	this	entire	discourse	is	deeply	flawed,	and	that	Aarseth was	right	to	disclaim	any	clinical	sense	of	autism.	The	only	way	to	responsibly discuss	the	idea	of	IF	as	the	embodied	aesthetics	of	one	diagnosable	margin	of the	population	would	be	to	survey	the	popularity	of	works	with	persons	thus diagnosed,	otherwise	we	should	admit	that	the	clinically	diagnosed	are	being conscripted	for	symbolic	use	by	their	putative	spectrum-sharers.	Behind	the problematic	medical	metaphor,	however,	each	author	raises	an	interesting	theory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	Cadre,	the	IF	object	tree	acts	as	a	pleasurable	filter	of	significance,	making	it a	very	specific	kind	of	escape	from	the	real	into	what	we	might	call	the	ideal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	Bond,	the	IF	object	tree	is	a	minimalist	‘framework’	that,	in	relation	to interactivity,	offers	a	pleasurable	escape	from	limitation	and	constraint.	Bond’s argument	sounds	strongly	to	me	like	the	recurring	fallacy	that	interactive	media is	characterized	by	freedom	rather	than	constraint,	an	idea	that	this	study systematically	rejects;	a	coloring	book	offers	a	far	more	pleasurable	minimal framework	for	a	truer	escape	from	limitation.	Likewise,	as	my	critiques	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a>Deadline	readings	and	of	puppet	theory	have	shown,	the	engagement	with another	‘mind’	or	conception	in	a	work	of	IF	is	fundamental	to	the	genre,	often uncomfortably	so.	As	recent	tropes	like	Montfort’s	‘riddle’	and	more longstanding	ones	like	the	‘crossword	puzzle’	suggest,	most	IF	artists	and designers	have	felt	rather	that	IF	interaction	is	a	struggle	to	engage	with	the conceptions	of	another	mind.	It	seems	strange	then	to	describe	IF’s	attraction	as an	escape	from	such	engagements. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cadre’s	argument	on	the	other	hand	has	more	subtle	implications:	the	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">object	tree	must,	by	its	nature,	differentiate	between	what	is	and	is	not	important, which	makes	the	IF	world	a	place	where	significance	is	not	the	responsibility	of the	interactor.	Yet	I	would	counter	that	in	artful	IF	the	descriptive	representation need	not	directly	reflect	significance	on	the	surface	of	the	text.	In	fact,	much	of the	art	of	IF	is	centered	around	not	just	allowing	the	interactor	to	manipulate	the object	tree,	but	first	concealing	aspects	such	that	they	must	be	discovered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Important	distinctions	must	be	discerned,	locations	must	be	explored,	items	must be	found,	and	so	forth.	It	may	be	true	that	the	interactor	does	not	assign significance,	but	she	must	still	discover	and	determine	significance.	IF	grants	her no	respite	into	a	world	free	of	signification	responsibilities.	While	the	author’s code	determines	significance	in	the	world,	the	interactor	is	required	to	learn	this private	conceptual	language	of	signification.	Hence	the	difficulty	of	IF	is	the difficulty	of	the	puzzle,	the	riddle,	and	the	implied	code. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	ability	to	interact	and	engage	with	another	perspective	through	language is	in	many	ways	the	exact	opposite	of	the	vaguely	proposed	medical	dysfunction, which	in	this	light	posits	the	strange	thesis	that	the	interactor	has	sought	out challenging	language	puzzles	about	foreign	concepts	because	she	herself	has difficulty	with	language	and	foreign	concepts	and	finds	them	unpleasant.	The original	confusion	is	in	the	idea	of	“language	difficulty,”	which	all	parties	have agreed	is	present.	But	whose	language	difficulty	is	it?	The	true	limited	figure	is neither	the	interactor	(as	Cadre	and	Bond	suggest)	nor	even	the	protagonist	(as Aarseth	implies),	but	the	underlying	parser	and	code.	Through	that	code,	the protagonist	is	subsequently	limited	in	range	of	action.	Due	to	that	limited	range of	action,	the	interactor	is	subsequently	limited	in	her	range	of	interaction.	In relation	to	the	interactor’s	imagination	and	conception	of	the	simulation,	the parser	is	always	manifestly	more	delimited	in	its	understanding	and	more	rigid	in its	conceptions.	This	creates	the	differential	sensation	of	the	process	of interrogation	that	is	misinterpreted	either	as	poor	embodiment	(puppet	theories) or	pathology	(autism	theories).	Instead,	it	is	the	nature	and	challenge	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a>necessarily	unequal	conversation	(interrogation)	that	gives	rise	to	difficulty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Interrogation	also	gives	rise	to	one	of	the	most	consistent	and	recognizable emergent	aesthetic	techniques	in	IF,	a	return	over	and	over	to	the	central	tropes of	disability	and	incapacity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Protagonist	dysfunction:	incapacity,	disability,	and	frustration While	frustration	is	the	core	problematic	of	IF	aesthetics,	incapacity	and disability	are	its	core	tropes.	The	term	disability	as	used	here	may	appear unnecessarily	provocative,	especially	given	my	qualms	about	the	metaphorical uses	of	persons	diagnosed	with	autism	in	the	service	of	critical	theory.	This provocation	is	intended,	however.	Command	line	interactions	focalized	on	a protagonist	are	necessarily	limiting,	and	have	consistently	focused	artist	and audience	attention	on	limitations	in	relation	to	the	normative	ability	to	act	�	that is,	disability.	This	study	unfortunately	does	not	undertake	to	fully	engage	the branch	of	contemporary	critical	theory	known	as	Disability	Studies	in	detail	(e.g. </p>
<p class="calibre1">see	Sharon	Snyder	et	al.‘s	Disability	Studies:	Enabling	the	Humanities,	2002), but	such	theoretical	analyses	of	IF	can	and	should	be	undertaken	for	a	number	of reasons.	First,	and	more	generally,	semiotic	simulation	(as	a	locus	of	speech	acts) is	a	productive	place	to	subject	normative	agency	to	ostranenie	or defamiliarization.	Defamiliarizing	normative	agency	is	one	of	the	key	goals	of Disability	Studies	discourses	with	respect	to	the	normatively	‘able’	body	and mind.	As	such,	the	form	of	the	critical	approach	and	the	form	of	the	genre	may be	mutually	well	suited.	Second,	and	more	particularly,	there	is	a	historic confluence	between	disabled	(particularly	blind)	new	media	gaming communities	and	semiotic	simulations	such	as	IF	and	MUDs,	whose	symbolic form	has	tended	to	render	them	tractable	to	technologies	such	as	screen-readers, and	hence	accessible.	As	I	suggest	in	my	reading	of	Shade	(Ch.	2),	confluence also	suggests	the	productive	exploration	of	a	strange	contradiction.	While	this genre	was	materially	constituted	around	highly	blind-accessible	technologies,	it was	conceptually	constituted	around	a	sighted	assumption	about	the	necessity	of light,	without	which	the	protagonist	is	usually	incapable	of	action.	Beyond	the mere	fact	of	this	irony	is	the	possibility	of	developing	alternative	semiotic simulation	architectures	that	might	reflect	the	experiences	and	expectations	of their	disabled	constituents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	incapacity	to	act	is	one	of	IF’s	most	fundamental	delimiting	gestures.	As we	considered	in	an	earlier	example,	a	front	door	that	marks	the	edge	of	the simulated	space	may	be	omitted	or	unimplemented.	It	may	also	be	coded	such</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>that	the	rejection	of	an	error	message	(“You	can’t	open	that”)	is	represented	as either	an	external,	physical	constraint	(“You	are	snowed	in”)	or	internal, psychological	constraint	(“You	promised	to	stay	home”).	For	example,	in	Roger Firth	and	Sonja	Kesserich’s	comedic	coding	example	“Captain	Fate”	(Inform Beginner’s	Guide	105-150,	211-227),	the	unimpressive	hero	is	constrained	to	the scene	of	action	by	his	desperate	need	to	find	a	private	space	(a	bar	bathroom)	to change	into	his	hero	costume.	Captain	Fate	is	psychologically	tied	to	this	nearest available	solution	to	his	problem,	yet	frustrated	by	constant	deferment	and complication	�	needing	a	bathroom	key	from	the	barman,	struggling	with	the light	switch,	worrying	about	the	door	being	locked,	and	so	forth.	The	elements that	prevent	simple	resolution	and	constrain	the	elaborate	solution	are	variously described	in	psychological,	social,	and	physical	terms,	but	they	all	converge thematically	on	Fate’s	comedic	frustration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many	works	of	IF	create	a	unified	language	constraint,	combining	the description	of	most	individual	psychological,	social,	or	physical	constraints	into powerful,	comprehensive	systems	of	constraint	that	are	deeply	tied	to	the concept	of	the	respective	work.	These	systematic	sources	of	constraint	might	be a	special	situation	of	the	world	or	a	special	condition	of	the	protagonist.	Of	these two	options,	the	move	to	formalize	constraint	in	the	protagonist	is	often	more effective,	as	the	protagonist	is	usually	the	consistent	element	in	an	often-varied environment.	Yet	the	distinction	is	not	always	clear,	as	the	modeled	IF	world may	in	fact	reflect	the	protagonist’s	worldview,	or	some	other	special	property	of the	protagonist’s	mind.	Whether	the	world,	the	protagonist,	or	some	combination is	the	origin	of	primary	constraint,	a	host	of	foreclosed	options	may	be	attributed to	a	single	cause.	This	single	constraining	cause	then	provides	a	compelling negative	shape	against	which	the	remaining	possibility	space	may	be	explored. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	purpose	of	these	limit-systems	is	to	render	the	necessarily	extreme constraints	of	the	IF	representation	aesthetic	by	incorporating	them	into	the diegesis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Semiotic	dysfunction:	disability	and	amnesia</p>
<p class="calibre1">We	have	already	seen	how	Andrew	Plotkin’s	Shade	deals	with	the	problem	of the	door.	The	darkness	it	hides	is	merely	a	metaphor	for	the	protagonist’s impending	or	recent	death.	In	Emily	Short’s	Metamorphoses	(2000),	the	world	is likewise	a	dream	�	an	astral	plane	into	which	a	bonded	servant	is	projected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	mystic	space	(like	its	code)	has	a	deep	logic	that	cannot	be	denied.	Shade and	Metamorphoses	have	respectively	realistic	and	fantastic	root	causes	(dying</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a>of	exposure	and	magical	transport)	but	in	the	end	the	two	works	are	both	about understanding	the	solipsistic	sense	of	dream-logic.	As	they	unfold,	these	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">dream-logics	explain	their	own	limitations,	whether	proactively	or	retroactively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	nature	of	the	astral	plane	or	the	nature	of	death	is	in	fact	a	code	that	contains the	experiences	of	the	protagonists.	A	myriad	of	causes	for	such	containments are	possible,	and	many	are	explored	in	a	variety	of	IF	works.	Stephen	Granade’s Losing	Your	Grip	(1998)	involves	the	hallucinations	brought	on	by	an	accidental reaction	to	a	nicotine	withdrawal	treatment,	while	Chris	Klimas’s	Mercy	(1997) appears	to	trace	(subjectively)	an	episode	in	the	experience	of	an	acute schizophrenic.	In	these	cases	the	underlying	realities	over	which	the	dream-logic lays	and	by	which	it	is	presumably	constrained	are	only	indistinctly	seen.	For	the protagonists,	real	and	imagined	constraints	are	not	meaningfully	distinct:	there are	only	constraints,	although	the	interactor	may	urge	the	protagonist	to	push	at these	boundaries	and	perhaps	even	break	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Systemic	constraint	can	be	physical.	Andrew	Plotkin’s	Hunter,	in	Darkness (1999)	deals	with	the	visceral,	sensory	experience	of	an	injured	hunter	trapped	in a	cave	system.	Here	the	representation	is	of	a	realistically	modeled	(rather	than dream)	space,	and	the	solution	to	escaping	its	maze	is	to	travel	such	that	the protagonist	follows	the	sound	or	smell.	Like	the	hidden	tickets	in	Shade,	this	is dream-logic	of	a	kind,	albeit	dream-logic	in	the	service	of	realism.	Egress	is	not a	set	of	concrete	coordinates	or	routes,	as	on	a	map,	but	instead	a	description	of the	act	of	tracking	whose	alternative	is	an	experientially	realistic	portrayal	of	a physically	disorienting	space.	While	in	the	cave	system,	the	distinction	between incapacity	and	disability	(that	is,	the	difference	between	the	dark	as	a	set	of external	conditions	and	blindness	as	a	personal	limitation)	is	not	important	to	the hunter’s	purpose.	Whether	due	to	self	or	circumstance,	normal	actions	are	not afforded,	and	the	hunter	must	relate	to	the	world	in	a	new	way.	Dan	Shiovitz’s Bad	Machine	(1998)	likewise	represents	crisis	as	a	malfunction	�</p>
<p class="calibre1">consciousness	�	in	the	circuitry	of	a	robot.	Both	the	robot’s	environment	and the	robot’s	physical	self	are	foreign	to	this	consciousness,	which	is	constituted by	the	explorations	and	interrogations	of	the	interactor.	Like	the	hunter	in darkness,	the	‘bad’	machine	consciousness	is	thrown	into	an	unfamiliar, constrained	situation.	Both	works	present	personal	circumstances	(injury, malfunction)	combined	with	a	hostile	environment	(a	cave	system,	a	dangerous factory)	that	urgently	motivates	a	solution.	The	dire	combination	explains	a	huge range	of	actions	that	are	out	of	scope	of	these	works,	and	allows	the	constraining error	messages	to	further	elucidate	the	limits	and	urgencies	of	how	the protagonist	is	situated.	At	the	most	basic	level,	this	creates	the	possibility	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a>general	rebuttal	to	all	inputs	that	are	not	anticipated	as	pertinent.	No	matter	what the	interactor	suggests,	she	won’t	be	doing	anything	unless	she	resolves	the	most immediate	and	pressing	problems. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	contrast,	Ian	Finley’s	Babel	(1997)	uses	amnesia	primarily	to	explain	not what	cannot	be	done,	but	what	must	be	done:	exploration.	Set	in	an	apparently abandoned	artic	research	facility,	the	protagonist	is	in	a	familiar	environment, but	cannot	remember	it,	putting	the	protagonist	in	the	same	state	as	the disoriented	interactor.	Because	amnesia	can	be	cured	in	the	game	(by	wandering the	environment	and	unlocking	memories	latent	in	objects)	the	interactor	and	the protagonist	have	the	same	quest.	Both	strive	to	recover	and	become	the	persona for	whom	the	environment	is	not	alien	and	other,	but	remembered	and understood.	Amnesia	is	a	recurrent	trope	in	IF,	arising	out	of	a	variety	of	causes and	contexts,	but	often	reflecting	some	deeper	trauma	in	the	relationship between	the	self	and	the	familiar	space.	In	Babel,	both	amnesia	and	its	recovery are	byproducts	of	techno-scientific	experimentation;	in	Suzanne	Britton’s amnesia-IF	Worlds	Apart	(1999)	the	system	of	the	world	is	fantastic	magic.	In Star	Foster	and	Daniel	Ravipinto’s	Slouching	Towards	Bedlam	(2003)	it	is	a byproduct	of	a	techno-mystical	process	(see	Ch.	4).	The	distinction	blurs, because	amnesia	in	IF	(and	games	more	generally)	is	always	a	logic	of	missing knowledge	that	will	be	recovered,	restoring	the	protagonist	(who	has	fallen	to the	alienated	states	of	interactor)	back	to	her	former	stature.	Until	then	she	must wander	familiar	spaces	and	peer	at	familiar	objects.	Amnesia,	in	other	words,	is the	master	trope	of	disorientation	and	the	unfamiliar.	In	the	semiotic	logic	of	the simulation,	disability	(the	incapacity	to	articulate	or	affect	those	signs	that change	the	system)	and	disorientation	(the	inability	to	anticipate	or	recall	those signs	that	constitute	the	system)	are	complementary	arcs	of	a	loop,	and	together encompass	all	of	semiotic	dysfunction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Frustration	aesthetics”	describes	the	diegetic	accommodation	of	these	twin semiotic	simulation	problems:	disability	and	disorientation.	Disability	is generally	experienced	as	extreme	limitations	on	the	protagonist’s	ability	to	act, while	disorientation	is	generally	experienced	as	a	gap	between	what	the protagonist	and	the	interactor	knows.	Protagonist	disabilities	and	unfamiliar	and alienating	situations	justify	the	interactor’s	experience	of	some	of	these	problems (because	they	define	the	protagonist’s	limitations),	while	amnesia	justifies	others (because	it	creates	an	unfamiliar	situation	for	the	protagonist	out	of	a	familiar one).	Partly	in	consequence,	examples	of	amnesic,	broken,	crazy,	drunk, hallucinating,	isolated,	lost,	malfunctioning,	narcoleptic,	possessed,	sick, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a>trapped,	and	otherwise	circumstantially	oppressed	protagonists	fill	the	IF	canon from	the	earliest	commercial	works	to	today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	is	not	to	say	that	all	IF	are	overtly	themed	around	frustration	and	conflict. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	major	exception	is	IF	art	pieces,	some	of	which	may	use	a	very	simple	set of	commands	(LOOK,	GO,	etc.)	to	arrange	a	kind	of	spatial-temporal	hypertext. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	absence	of	a	complex	interaction	model,	frustration	aesthetics	becomes less	useful.	Conversational	IF	works	are	another	interesting	exception.	Works such	as	Emily	Short’s	Best	of	Three	(2001)	and	Galatea	(2000)	or	Jim	Fisher’s Medusa	(2003)	often	focus	on	potentially	frustrating	conversations.	To	the	extent that	they	focus	on	chatbot-like	permissive	parsing	or	drama	management	vs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">prescriptive	parsing	and	action	management,	frustration	may	not	be	the	most productive	lens	for	understanding	them.	Where	frustration	aesthetics	tends	to emphasize	what	is	denied,	modeling	the	logic	of	a	conversation	tends	to	be additive,	emphasizing	instead	the	logic	that	in	improvisational	acting	is	often described	as	“Yes,	and.”	Galatea	may	be	a	frustrating	conversational	partner,	and each	conversational	turn	brings	with	it	lost	opportunities,	yet	her	interlocutor’s insensitivity	or	confusion	is	only	marginally	comparable	to	disability	or disorientation. </p>

Even	in	such	works, however,	we	may	still	find	that	a	thematically	coherent	pattern	of	limitations (e.g.	the	frustrations	and	oppressions	of	shopping	on	Christmas	Eve,	or	the inadequacies	and	limits	of	being	a	two	foot	tall	stuffed	toy)	reflect	a	similar	deep pattern	of	code	being	used	to	anticipate	and	craft	experience	in	ways	specific	not just	to	conflict,	but	conflict	about	fundamental	agency.	The	frustration	aesthetics approach	is	not	about	frustrating	themes	per	se.	Rather	it	considers	how	themes may	reflect	frustrating	structures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through	frustration	aesthetics	the	IF	work	artfully	defamiliarizes	and	denies interaction,	the	result	is	generally	not	a	deconstruction	of	interaction	typical	of net.art	such	as	the	works	of	Jodi.	Instead,	IF	frustrations	often	exist	in	order	to	be overcome.	Whether	they	are	in	fact	overcome	or	not,	IF	frustration	aesthetics presents	a	set	of	capacities	framed	within	a	set	of	incapacities	that	reflect	some underlying	logic.	Why	can	the	protagonist	not	do?	Why	does	the	protagonist	not know?	Whatever	complex	riddle	or	simple	linear	ride-on-rails	the	IF	work</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a>presents,	it	is	the	character	of	this	vast	and	encompassing	negative	space	that frustration	aesthetics	attempts	to	make	beautiful. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p164"></a>IF	defined	at	its	limits</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus	far	I	have	defined	IF	many	times	�	as	form,	as	historical	development, as	cultural	concept,	and	as	experience.	Here	I	want	to	define	IF	one	last	time, focusing	on	very	small	intervals	during	which	IF	processes	can	be	observed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These	small	IF	�	including	minimal	works,	fragments,	and	hypothetical examples	�	reveal	the	essence	of	their	larger	counterparts.	In	contemporary experiments,	small	IF	further	suggest	alternatives	to	traditional	limits	and conventions.	Just	as	implied	code	illuminates	the	revelatory	role	of	conclusions, and	just	as	frustration	aesthetics	illuminates	the	limiting	role	of	the	protagonist, this	chapter	aims	to	illuminate	small	IF,	both	through	structural	theory	and through	close	interactions	with	specific	works.	While	many	examples	will	be considered,	our	eventual	focus	is	on	how	the	experience	of	IF	operates	outside and	across	multiple	traversals	or	play	sessions,	with	special	consideration	of endings	that	invite	replay	(e.g.	Adam	Cadre’s	9:05	(1999),	Jon	Ingolds’s	Fail-Safe	(2000))	and	extended	close	readings	of	works	that	occur	in	a	replay-cycle or	time	loop:	Sam	Barlow’s	Aisle	(1999),	Adam	Cadre’s	Shrapnel	(2000),	Star Foster	and	Daniel	Ravipinto’s	Slouching	Towards	Bedlam	(2003),	and	Andrew Pontious’s	Rematch	(2000). </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	is	the	essence	of	IF?	While	I’ve	previously	contrasted	the	expansive locations	of	Adventure	with	the	contemporary	“one-room”	sub-genre	(Ch.	2),	I’ll begin	here	with	an	even	more	radical	set	of	constraints	�	a	single	situation	at one	moment	in	time	coupled	with	one	event	and	its	outcome.	A	humorous example	is	provided	by	Mark	J.	Musante’s	Silence	of	the	Lambs:	an	interactive horror	(1996),	a	novelty	work	presented	here	in	its	entirety: <i class="calibre3">Down	on	the	farm</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lambs	are	really	noisy	here. </p>

<p class="calibre1">You	have	achieved	the	rank	of	FBI	agent</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p165"></a>Silence	of	the	Lambs	puns	on	the	Thomas	Harris’s	1988	novel	and	1991	film The	Silence	of	the	Lambs.	The	original	stories	center	on	trainee	FBI	agent Clarice	Starling’s	interviews	with	incarcerated	cannibal	psychiatrist	Dr.	Hannibal Lector	as	she	tracks	a	flaying	serial	killer.	Relying	on	the	title	of	the	work,	an interactor	might	expect	a	rendition	of	this	popular	story	(or	at	least	a	substantial parody).	Instead,	she	is	surprised	by	a	scene	that	is	merely	a	literal	rendition	of the	title…	then	surprised	again	when	the	rank	of	‘FBI	agent’	is	granted,	slyly reintroducing	the	allusion	in	response	to	an	apparently	innocuous	action.	Yet	the act	of	silencing	lambs	has	everything	to	do	with	Harris’s	original	tale.	Starling has	a	traumatic	memory	of	butchered	lambs	screaming	during	a	slaughter	on	her uncle’s	farm.	This	memory	becomes	a	personal	metaphor	for	her,	both	in	her drive	to	save	the	victims	of	serial	killers	and	in	her	search	for	inner	peace	�	a peace	that	is	alluded	to	as	“the	silence	of	the	lambs”	by	both	the	escaped	Lector and	the	narrator	at	the	conclusion	of	the	novel.	Despite	this,	the	descriptive ambiguity	of	the	book	title	sets	an	ominous	tone:	are	the	silent	lambs	calm	or dead?	This	ambiguity	crosses	over	quite	easily	into	the	imperative	ambiguity	of the	IF	command:	are	the	lambs	silenced	by	the	act	of	calming,	or	by	killing? </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	the	interactive	joke	helps	us	infer	the	correct	action	(SILENCE)	and reports	the	reaction,	we	are	still	left	with	a	gap	in	the	actual	meaning	that	bridges the	two	states.	The	interactor	who	participates	either	plays	the	protector	or	the butcher.	It	is	either	a	fairly	mild	joke	or	a	fairly	bleak	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	minimal	case	of	an	art	form	is	worthy	of	special	consideration	because	it illuminates	what	is	both	necessary	and	sufficient	for	that	form	�	in	other	words, minimal	cases	are	definitive,	either	by	formal	definition	or	by	example.	Consider the	entry	from	A	Dictionary	of	Narratology	in	which	Gerald	Prince	succinctly defines	a	“minimal	story”	and	provides	an	example: A	narrative	recounting	only	two	states	and	one	event,	such	that	(1)	one	state precedes	the	event	in	time	and	the	event	precedes	the	other	state	in	time	(and causes	it);	(2)	the	second	state	constitutes	the	inverse	(or	the	modification, including	the	“zero”	modification)	of	the	first.	“John	was	happy,	then	he	saw Peter,	then,	as	a	result,	he	was	unhappy”	is	a	minimal	story.	(53) The	minimal	story	is	a	story	in	its	irreducible,	essential	form.	By	analogy	to	a minimal	story,	how	might	we	define	a	minimal	interactive	fiction,	and	what	is minimal	interactivity?	We	could	craft	examples	using	any	number	of	transcript fragments	from	the	openings	of	well-known	works	such	as	Adventure	or	Zork. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet	classic	examples	would	almost	certainly	involve	a	direct	object	manipulated</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a>in	the	classic	era	“two-word	parser”	style	(e.g.	OPEN	MAILBOX,	GET	LAMP</p>
<p class="calibre1">etc.),	which	is	already	too	complex	for	our	purposes.	Instead	let’s	begin	with something	simpler	by	following	Prince	in	imagining	a	work	of	IF	that	might, during	interaction,	produce	this	parallel	example: You	are	happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	LOOK</p>
<p class="calibre1">You	see	Peter,	which	makes	you	unhappy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	transcription	introduces	a	number	of	changes,	including	changes	from	past to	present	tense,	from	third	person	to	second	person	description,	and	from	an event	clause	to	an	imperative	tense	command	followed	by	a	result	verb.	These changes	serve	to	make	the	example	appear	prototypically	IF-like,	but	their necessity	for	good	IF	design	is	arguable.	Starting	from	this	example,	I’ll	spend the	next	several	pages	just	considering	these	very	aspects	of	prototypical	IF.	To what	extent	are	these	dominant	in	the	IF	canon?	Why	might	they	be	preferred? </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	happens	when	authors	experiment	with	other	forms?	Having	proposed	a minimal	form,	I’ll	interrogate	it	by	asking	if	it	must	be	as	presented,	and	if	so why.	The	exploration	of	alternatives	will	draw	on	fragments	from	a	large	number of	contemporary	works	of	IF,	raising	a	number	of	issues	along	the	way	that	will help	frame	our	definition	of	minimal	IF	and	provide	a	context	for	the	subsequent readings	of	experimental	short	IF. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IF	and	the	sequence	of	closure	vs.	comics</p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps	the	easiest	change	to	explain	is	why	the	minimal	input	in	our	example has	lost	its	direct	object,	becoming	LOOK	rather	than	LOOK	AT	PETER.	This	is necessary	because	only	the	simulation	can	supply	objects,	while	the	interactor can	only	refer	to	them.	Presuming	(as	our	minimal	example	does)	that	nothing has	come	before,	it	would	be	nonsensical	for	the	user	to	suddenly	refer	to	an object	(Peter)	that	hadn’t	been	implied	in	any	way	by	the	discourse	�</p>
<p class="calibre1">nonsensical,	and	also	a	breach	virtually	assured	of	resulting	in	an	error	message. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	course,	the	simulation	might	be	elaborated	to	imply	the	presence	of	an addressable	direct	object	in	the	code:</p>
<p class="calibre1">You	are	happy.	A	man	is	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	LOOK	AT	THE	MAN</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a>You	see	that	the	man	is	Peter,	which	makes	you	unhappy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	goal	is	minimalism,	however,	so	we’ll	stick	with	the	bare	verb	example	for now.	The	larger	point	is	that,	unlike	the	verb-object	“saw	Peter”	that	Prince	uses as	a	vector	to	effect	a	minimal	story	state	change,	in	interactive	fiction	objects and	states	are	the	domain	of	the	system	while	verbs	are	the	domain	of	the	user. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Direct	objects	must	either	be	provided	before	or	revealed	after	the	user’s	verb, with	the	suggested	and	actualized	change	never	appearing	as	a	unit	(as	in Prince),	but	rather	straddling	the	divide	of	the	interface. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	31.	For	McCloud,	comics	closure	is	action	that	readers	supply	in	the gap	(or	gutter)	between	panels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	this	difference,	it	is	interesting	to	see	how	well	Prince’s	model	(an event	transition	between	two	states)	maps	against	the	interactive	fiction	model	of story	simulation	on	a	computer.	In	IF	the	simulation	presents	a	state	(happy),	to which	the	user	reacts	with	an	event	(LOOK),	to	which	the	simulation	re-reacts (that	is,	interacts)	with	a	new	state	(unhappy).	The	input	that	makes	up	the	event is	a	kind	of	externally	supplied	closure	between	two	states,	functioning	not unlike	the	way	Scott	McCloud	describes	closure	in	the	field	of	comics.	In Understanding	Comics	McCloud	describes	closure	as	“the	agent	of	change,	time, and	motion”	(65-69),	and	identifies	the	site	of	comics	closure	as	the	gutter,	or space	between	two	panels.	Interestingly,	like	the	command	line	at	which	the	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">user	must	supply	a	verb	in	order	for	the	story	to	advance,	McCloud	conceives	of the	comics	gutter	as	an	external	site	of	meaning,	requiring	a	“willing	and conscious	collaborator”	“accomplice”	and	“participant”	(the	comic	reader)	in order	to	transform	two	separate	images	(or	states)	into	one	narrative	event. </p>
<p class="calibre1">McCloud’s	emphasis	on	consensual,	creative	participation	is	provocative	for thinking	about	continuities	between	comics	and	interactive	art;	the	disjunctions are	equally	provocative.	Typing	at	the	command	line	is	primarily	a	site	of anticipatory	or	prospective	closure	�	an	attempt	(which	may	be	frustrated)	to discover	or	solve	the	gap	between	the	current	state	of	the	simulation	and	its	next state.	Reading	comics,	on	the	other	hand,	is	only	prospective	in	small	part. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gutters	are	primarily	sites	of	reactionary	or	retrospective	closure.	Although	the gutter	in	what	we	might	term	the	minimal	comic	is	situated	between	the	first	and second	panel	in	space,	the	meaning	that	it	acquires	through	closure	is	situated last	in	time,	resolving	only	after	the	second	panel	has	been	apprehended.	The comics	reader	may	anticipate	the	fall	of	the	axe,	but	can	begin	to	‘close’	the	axe motion	after	seeing	the	scream	in	the	second	panel.	Narrative	accrues	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a>stitching	motion.	This	is	a	motion	of	the	mind	more	than	the	eyes,	but	we	might imagine	the	motion	as	a	line	looping	back	to	each	gutter	in	a	stitch-step, assigning	the	gutter	meaning	before	moving	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	32.	The	numbered	line	traces	my	representation	of	reading	as	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘stitches’	the	gutter	into	comics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">McCloud	makes	several	nuanced	points	about	reading	comics	in	space	and time,	but	misses	the	last-ness	of	the	gutter.	This	omission	may	be	because	he	is focused	on	the	motion	of	the	reader’s	eyes	rather	than	on	the	construction	of	the sjuzet.	Another	possibility	is	that	it	is	a	confusion	inherited	in	McCloud’s	use	of Will	Eisner’s	coinage	“sequential	art”	as	a	cornerstone	for	his	work.	In	Graphic Storytelling	(1996),	Eisner	expands	on	his	ideas	about	sequence	and arrangement	from	an	author’s	perspective,	defining	for	example	story	as	“the narration	of	a	sequence	of	events	deliberately	arranged	for	the	telling”	(9). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sequence	for	Eisner	is	telling-order,	not	reading	order,	and	it	is	easy	for	the grand	term	“sequential”	to	eclipse	Eisner’s	expansive	sense	of	the	possibilities for	different	forms	of	reader	‘contracts’	(49),	or	his	nuanced	views	of	the	reader as	actor	(57)	and	participant	(71).	This	easy	oversimplification	is	encouraged	by Eisner’s	many	comparisons	between	sequential	graphic	narrative	as	it	occurs	in comics	and	film.	While	the	arrangements	of	the	artist	may	be	spatially sequential,	however,	it	is	important	to	remember	that	the	process	of	closure	in comics,	which	Eisner	describes	as	“surmising	the	intervening	action”	(49),	not does	not	parallel	this	spatial	sequence	in	time.	Eisner’s	surmising	is	hitch-stepped	and	re-sequential,	a	mode	in	which	cause	always	follows	a	half	step behind	the	discovery	of	its	effect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	amazing	thing	about	sequential	art,	then,	is	our	ability	to	believe	that	it	is sequential	no	matter	how	many	times	we	cross	the	gutter	in	blankness	and waiting,	only	discovering	its	role	in	the	“sequence”	as	we	mentally	turn	to	look back.	A	structural	parallel	to	this	process	of	interpretation	in	IF	would	require	the interactor	to	deduce	rather	than	direct	the	story: You	are	happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peter	makes	you	unhappy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	happened?	&gt;	LOOKED</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	minimal	interactive	fiction,	by	contrast,	requires	an	alternating	discourse</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p169"></a>between	interactor	and	simulation	in	order	to	stage	the	play	of	state	transition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Until	the	action	is	supplied,	the	second	state	cannot	be	known.	Here	Prince’s example	appears	similar	to	IF	in	requiring	that	elements	of	a	minimal	story succeed	each	other	in	time	(state-event-state).	His	example	notwithstanding, Prince	does	not	require	that	the	three	elements	maintain	this	order	in	discourse:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“John	was	happy,	then	he	was	unhappy	because	he	saw	Peter”	is	presumably	a satisfactory	alternative	arrangement	of	a	minimal	story,	whereas	is	it	an unsatisfactory	order	for	IF	because	it	models	only	minimal	reactivity	(about which	more	later).	Minimal	interactive	fiction	is	distinctive,	therefore,	in	that	in order	to	allow	the	prospective	closure	of	agency	it	must	require	that	both	the narrative	and	the	discourse	proceed	in	the	same	order. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p170"></a>IF	person	and	tense</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	special	relationship	of	a	simulation	like	IF	to	linear	time	suggests	that	in IF	tenses	have	special	significations	and	limits.	Before	considering	how	minimal IF	might	work	(or	not	work)	in	the	past	tense,	I’d	like	to	review	tense	and	person together	as	a	decision	matrix	and	elaborate	on	the	strong	determining	effect	that input	mode	and	person	in	IF	have	over	descriptive	tense.	The	goal	remains	to elucidate	what	is	essential	to	IF,	and	what	is	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Revisiting	the	changes	in	my	transcription	of	Prince:	‘John’	becomes	‘You,’</p>
<p class="calibre1">while	“John	saw	Peter”	becomes	“LOOK”	+	“You	see	Peter…”  <i class="calibre3">etc. </i>	The	shift	to conventional	second	person	may	be	prototypical	of	IF,	but,	unlike	the	order	of input	and	result,	this	shift	is	not	strictly	necessary.	Nor	is	the	shift	to	the	present tense	strictly	necessary.	Rather	than	imagining	alternate	modes	of	IF,	here	we can	consider	examples	as	they	have	occurred	in	some	recent	experimental	works. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	context	of	minimalism	and	definitions,	my	general	goal	is	to	analyze	the logic	of	experimental	IF	discourse	modes,	and	in	doing	so	show	how	they	are almost	necessarily	elaborations	or	complications	of	the	relationships	in conventional	IF	discourse	modes.	In	addition	to	the	history	and	theory	already covered,	statistics	give	a	good	sense	of	the	relative	frequency	of	what	we	might term	conventionality	and	the	relative	frequency	or	infrequency	of experimentalism	in	IF. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	source	of	statistics	is	Baf’s	Guide	to	the	Interactive	Fiction	Archive,	one of	the	most	complete	extant	catalogues	of	IF	from	1976	to	the	present.	Baf’s Guide	numbers	come	with	some	caveats.	First,	the	Guide	largely	catalogs	the files	available	for	public	download	on	the	Interactive	Fiction	Archive,	and	thus works	not	released	into	the	public	domain	are	not	represented.	While	many previously	commercial	works	have	been	so	released,	many	are	not	available through	the	Archive	for	copyright	reasons,	and	thus	are	not	in	the	Guide	�</p>
<p class="calibre1">including	for	example	most	works	of	Infocom.	Another	concern	is	that cataloging	itself	is	also	not	complete.	For	example,	the	database	form	contains	a checkbox	indicating	whether	each	work	contains	“third	person	narration”	or	not, but	there	may	be	works	in	the	third	person	(or	containing	third	person	sections) which	are	not	correctly	marked.	Finally,	the	institution	of	the	Archive	grew	out of	a	culture	surrounding	the	use	of	certain	development	languages	and	tools,	and works	written	by	these	communities	(ALAN,	Hugo,	Inform,	TADS	etc.)	tend	to be	over-represented	compared	to	other	communities	(e.g.	Adrift,	or	the	tool-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p171"></a>agnostic	AIF	scene)	whose	authors	have	not	organized	around	the	Archive	as their	primary	repository.	Despite	the	representative	bias	towards	a	subset	of contemporary	and	public	domain	IF,	Baf’s	Guide	provides	an	interesting representative	sketch	of	IF	distribution.	Of	the	2659	works	currently	catalogued in	Baf’s	Guide,	137	(5%)	are	listed	in	the	first	person,	and	57	(2%)	are	listed	in the	third,	with	the	remainder	listed	in	the	second.	Even	more	dramatically,	only 19	(0.7%)	are	listed	in	the	past	tense.	Of	these,	the	use	of	the	past	tense	and	the use	of	the	second	person	have	been	nearly	mutually	exclusive.	I	have	turned	up only	one	example,	an	unfinished	demo	that	was	apparently	written	to	showcase the	ability	of	a	library	to	allow	the	interactor	to	dynamically	shift	tense	using	the TENSE	command.	Prince’s	example	mode	of	the	third	person	past	may	be prototypical	for	stories,	but	the	third	person	past	in	IF	occurs	at	the	intersection of	the	least	common	tense	with	the	least	common	person,	and	has	been documented	in	only	12	IF	works. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Why	does	the	IF	distribution	look	as	dramatic	as	it	does,	and	what	can	we deduce	from	it?	One	answer	might	be	that	the	dominant	mode	was	established	as kind	of	historic	accident	by	influential	forbears	such	as	Adventure	and	the products	of	companies	like	Infocom.	This	is	not	to	say	that	alternate	modes weren’t	explored	early.	39	of	the	57	catalogued	third	person	IF	are	not contemporary	experiments,	but	were	commercial	works	written	for	the	Sinclair ZX	Spectrum	and	circulated	primarily	in	British	and	European	markets	between 1985-1992.	Most	of	these	works	are	now	available	via	the	Zenobi	catalog	(which may	contain	more	undocumented	third	person	works),	and	most	were	written serially	by	a	small	group	of	authors,	including	Craig	Davies,	Scott	Denyer, George	E.	Hoyle,	John	Wilson,	and	especially	Fergus	McNeill,	who	wrote prolifically	in	both	the	third	person	and	the	past	tense.	The	works	appear	to	have been	predominantly	parodies	of	popular	cultural	phenomena,	beginning	with	the fantasy	of	J.	R.	R.	Tolkien	(e.g.	Bored	of	the	Rings,	Balrog’s	Day	Out	etc.)	but</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p172"></a>expanded	to	mock	such	disparate	subjects	as	Star	Wars	(Star	Flaws)	Robin	Hood (Robin	of	Sherlock),	The	Big	Chill	(The	Big	Sleaze),	and	so	forth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	am	not	certain	whether	third	 <i class="calibre3">past	IF	emerged	from	the	default	mode	of	a</i> <i class="calibre3">certain	IF	development	tool,	or	followed	the	house	style	for	an	IF	publishing</i> <i class="calibre3">group,	or	reflected	a	certain	national	outlook.	Yet	the	fact	that	third	</i> past	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">flourished	briefly	as	a	kind	of	school	and	returned	later	in	the	form	of experimentalism	may	only	in	part	reflect	cultural	biases.	There	are	more fundamental	linguistic	and	technical	factors	that	have	helped	to	maintain	the status	of	second	person	present	tense	IF	as	normative	and	other	modes	as experimental.	One	factor	relates	to	verb	construction	in	English,	which	is extremely	simple	in	the	present	tense	and	thus	more	amenable	to	parsing	as input,	as	well	as	to	parser	manipulation	in	constructed	output	sentences.	Other modes	require	either	more	sophisticated	systems	or	else	customization	to conjugate	and	smooth	over	rough	patches	in	language.	Parser-friendly	verbs might	be	one	partial	explanation	of	the	preference	for	first	person	over	third person	works:	the	command	LOOK	appears	in	the	response	“You	look,”	as	it does	in	the	response	“I	look,”	but	the	third	person	“He	looks”	and	the	past	tense</p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	looked”	both	require	extra	transformation,	which	is	to	say	special	handling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unless	the	past	tense	is	automatically	and	invisibly	handled	by	development tools,	the	tense	introduces	authoring	difficulties	that	act	as	a	deterrent	to common	use.	In	the	meantime,	the	complexities	of	English	language	conjugation are	a	problem	for	IF	parsing,	and	present	tense	input	is	one	partial	solution	that simplifies	the	problem.	This	further	refines	our	idea	of	minimalism	in	IF.	Just	as IF	is	traditionally	expansive	(as	a	simulation),	it	is	traditionally	simple	(as	an interaction). </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	English	conjugation	informed	the	design	of	many	early	works	of	IF,	it likewise	informed	the	design	of	IF	developer	toolsets	and	languages	that	became the	standard	middleware	which	replaced	the	from-scratch	(or	“roll-your-own”) model	of	early	IF	design.	These	toolsets	optimized	around	and	defaulted	to	the second	person,	making	the	second	person	present	not	just	a	shared	preference	of IF	authoring	communities	but	a	shared	technique,	materially	inherited	in	the form	of	code.	The	tools	modeled	and	replaced	the	language,	and	this	model became	the	true	context	of	IF,	with	the	assumptions	of	the	tool	authors aesthetically	embedded	in	new	works.	These	“default	aesthetics”	required substantial	effort	to	escape,	a	fact	that	strongly	influenced	the	long-term formation	of	the	genre.	While	the	most	sophisticated	and	popular	development languages	of	the	1990s	allowed	for	the	creation	of	other	kinds	of	work	through</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p173"></a>customization	of	default	messages,	extension	libraries,	parser	hacking	and	so forth,	such	activities	were	generally	limited	to	those	few	authors	with	both	a dedicated	interest	in	experimenting	with	narration	(as	opposed	to	storytelling) and	the	technical	mastery	to	remake	the	system	(or	a	willingness	to	eschew	its luxuries	and	start	from	scratch).	Those	unable	to	do	such	a	wall-to-wall	rewrite would	create	Frankensteinian	amalgamations,	with	pieces	of	third	person	or	past tense	description	stitched	together	by	second	person	present	tense	messages interjected	by	the	parser.	All	this	suggests	that	the	second	person	is	itself	a	mode of	minimalism	�	not	necessarily	of	expression	or	of	interaction,	but	of	authorial effort	and	of	code.	Much	like	the	transition	from	two-word	parsers	to	the	current command	line,	major	aesthetic	shifts	may	accompany	the	introduction	of	new software	development	tools	that	make	these	complexities	more	tractable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Person	in	IF:	First	and	third	as	separate	self</p>
<p class="calibre1">First	and	third	person	works	may	be	statistically	rare,	but	do	they	function differently	in	any	important	ways	from	more	conventional	IF?	Turning	now	to examples,	one	of	the	striking	aesthetic	effects	we	encounter	is	a	distinctly	non-minimalist	complication	�	the	figure	of	the	protagonist’s	separate	self.	This distinction	exists	in	many	second	person	works	of	IF	as	well.	Yet	the	tendency	of the	second	person	(as	with	the	first-person	camera	in	video	games)	is	to	efface the	protagonist,	making	him	or	her	appear	either	invisible	or	trivially	distinct from	the	interactor	(and	vice	versa).	While	considering	frustration	aesthetics (Ch.	3)	we	saw	how	the	situational	and	structural	limits	of	interaction	are incorporated	into	the	narrative	context	and	characterized	in	the	person	of	the protagonist.	In	reading	Shade	we	saw	the	traveler	initially	characterized	as	subtly continuous	with	the	limits	of	the	interactor’s	situation,	but	finally	depicted	as separate	and	alien	in	an	uncanny	moment	of	direct	address	that	overthrows	the illusion	of	the	command	line.	Most	first	and	third	person	works	of	IF	invert	this process,	beginning	with	and	foregrounding	the	distinction	between	interactor	and protagonist.	In	confronting	the	character,	the	interactor	asks	“If	this	is	the protagonist,	who	am	I?	What	is	my	relationship,	or	my	role	here?”	My proposition	is	that,	much	like	the	stance	of	metafiction,	works	that	raise	these questions	tend	to	be	artful	by	definition,	in	that	they	require	more	craft	and artifice	that	elaborates	on	or	reverses	the	norms	of	minimal	interactive	fiction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ian	Haberkorn’s	Conan	Kill	Everything	(2005)	is	a	brief	humorous	work	of	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">whose	use	of	relentless	third	person	narration	signifies	the	worldview	of	Conan, a	brute	so	simple	that	he	apparently	refers	to	himself	in	the	third	person:	“the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p174"></a>evil	wizard	has	destroyed	all	that	Conan	loved.	Now,	after	years	of	searching, Conan	has	finally	found	him.	Conan	is	ready	for	revenge”.	Whether	Conan	is narrated	about	or	is	himself	narrating,	he	is	distinct	from	the	interactor.	This distinction	is	made	even	more	explicit	each	time	the	work	ends,	when	it	is revealed	that	‘Conan’	is	actually	an	actor	on	a	low	budget	set.	Take	for	example this	rather	gruesome	sequence:</p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;EXAMINE	WALL</p>
<p class="calibre1">Conan	is	too	dumb	to	describe	the	walls	and	ceiling	any	better	than	that	they really	consist	of	yellowish	clay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;KILL	LOINCLOTH</p>
<p class="calibre1">Conan	stabs	at	his	loincloth.	Alas!	Conan	is	bleeding	to	death! </p>
<p class="calibre1">***	Conan	has	died.	***</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cut!	CUT!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Studio	lights	flare	up	and	the	crew	breaks	into	disappointed	chatter	as	the director	rushes	on	stage,	carefully	avoiding	the	fake	blood	on	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sometimes	I	wonder,	how	dumb	are	you	really?	I	mean,	what’s	this	movie called?	Conan	kill	something?	Conan	kill	himself	halfway	through?	It’s EVERYTHING,	EVERYTHING,	you	hear?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	Conan	(rather	than	‘you’)	is	too	dumb	to	properly	examine	the	wall, and	too	dumb	to	avoid	bleeding	to	death,	the	real	‘you’	is	an	actor	standing	in	a pool	of	fake	blood,	and	this	‘you’	(rather	than	Conan)	is	held	to	a	higher	standard by	the	director.	This	actor-protagonist	has	the	goal	of	acting	out	the	oneliner premise	of	the	script	/	game	by	killing	everything;	if	the	verb	KILL	is	a	hammer, then	wizards,	flies,	doors,	clothing,	and	indeed	every	addressable	object	in	the system	looks	like	a	nail.	Interactor	and	protagonist	correspond	here	to	the	split personality	stance	of	the	method	actor	and	his	role,	while	the	system	disciplines the	proceedings	through	the	persona	of	the	‘director.’	While	the	interactor	never has	the	opportunity	to	take	the	actor	offstage,	this	narrative	frame	around Conan’s	adventure	serves	both	as	a	self-conscious	wink	at	the	content	and	as	a pointer	towards	the	second	self	that	is	displaced	by	Conan’s	third	person description.	The	persona	of	the	actor	creates	a	place	for	the	interactor’s</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p175"></a>perspective	to	enter	the	story	in	the	form	of	this	‘you.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	first	person	and	third	person	IF	still	describe	a	‘you,’	in	fact.	This	‘you’</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	not	the	primary	subject	of	discourse,	however,	and	so	stands	a	step	removed	or at	a	higher	order	of	complexity,	addressed	in	occasional	interjections.	An	author can	displace	or	defer	the	‘you’,	but	it	is	difficult	(or	highly	unusual)	to	remove	it completely.	Many	works	prefer	to	air	the	issue	at	once.	Shay	Caron’s	Chaos (1999)	does	this	economically	in	the	preface	to	the	first	interaction,	introducing the	protagonist	in	the	figure	of	upstart	supervillian	Captain	Chaos,	then explaining	‘your’	role:</p>
<p class="calibre1">At	any	rate,	this	is	where	you	come	in.	In	just	five	minutes	(more	or	less), he’ll	be	struggling	to	stay	in	the	air	as	his	ship	clips	a	huge	tree,	loses	power,	and starts	to	crash	[….]</p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	being	addressed,	who	‘you’	are	is	difficult	to	determine.	From	the outset	the	interactor	seems	to	have	a	very	odd	status	functioning	in	a	third-person	simulated	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	SOUTH</p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	moment,	Captain	Chaos	is	soundly	asleep.	It’s	doubtful	a	herd	of	rhinos running	through	the	room	would	wake	 <i class="calibre3">him</i>	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	EXAMINE	SWITCH</p>
<p class="calibre1">It	looks	like	an	ordinary	autopilot	switch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	PUSH	SWITCH</p>
<p class="calibre1">(trying	to	reach	the	autopilot	switch	first)</p>
<p class="calibre1">He’ll	have	to	get	out	of	the	hammock	to	reach	the	autopilot	switch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	one	hand,	the	interactor	cannot	move,	because	Captain	Chaos	(third person)	is	the	body	connected	to	agency,	and	that	body	is	asleep.	On	the	other hand,	the	interactor	can	view	the	environment	without	the	Captain’s	eyes.	Yet only	the	Captain	can	act	on	what	is	seen	by	these	eyes.	What	is	this	entity	at	the command	line?	If	the	entity	is	not	the	Captain’s	id	or	subconscious,	perhaps	it	is a	ghost	or	astral	projection?	Since	there	is	nothing	in	the	diegesis	to	explain</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p176"></a>either	this	perspective	or	the	Captain’s	receipt	of	impulses,	the	simplest	answer seems	to	be	‘the	interactor’	�	a	person	sitting	at	a	keyboard,	manipulating	a fictional	character	in	a	work	of	IF	in	purely	extradiegetic	terms.	If	the	tendency of	the	second	person	is	generally	to	cast	a	curtain	over	this	real	self,	here	the third	person	instead	brings	the	second	into	sharp	relief,	puncturing	the	fourth wall	of	the	interface. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	difficult	for	me	to	say	whether	this	puncture	in	Chaos	is	intentional	or merely	a	design	flaw	that	arises	as	an	unintended	consequence	of	the	third person.	Yet	such	punctures	can	be	staged	intentionally	to	great	effect.	In Valentine	Kopteltsev’s	A	Night	Guest	(2001),	the	whimsical,	verse-based	IF	is narrated	in	first	person	by	Lord	Barkley,	who	after	a	night	of	hard	drinking	has collapsed	in	a	stupor	into	his	own	fireplace.	As	Barkley	narrates	his	actions	in the	first	person,	he	(rather	than	the	system)	also	has	the	opportunity	to	address the	interactor	directly.	‘You’	are	the	voice	in	Lord	Barkley’s	head	trying	to	guide him	to	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;STAND</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I’m	too	drunk	to	stand.	I	could	sit	at	best.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;EXAMINE	ME</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	you	are	sitting	on	the	other	side	of	the	monitor	screen	from	me, remember?	Thus,	I	can’t	see	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	‘ME’	normally	refers	to	the	combined	figure	of	the	interactor	/</p>
<p class="calibre1">protagonist,	the	first	person	mode	here	emphasizes	Lord	Barkley’s	separate	self. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus	he	responds,	not	by	reporting	on	his	own	condition,	but	by	puncturing	the fiction	to	remind	the	interactor	that	the	usual	situation	has	changed.	This	is	an interesting	twist,	particularly	because	it	pokes	fun	at	one	of	the	conventions	of command	line	conversation.	The	parser	(and,	by	extension,	the	protagonist) doesn’t	relate	what	the	interactor	says,	but	what	she	means.	Thus	inputs	such	as TELL	GALATEA	ABOUT	ART	and	ASK	ORC	ABOUT	AXE	conventionally generate	reactions	that	indicate	the	interactor’s	impulses	have	been	translated into	an	appropriate	corresponding	elocution,	just	as	EXAMINE	ME	can	stand	in for	“(I	would	like	to)	examine	myself.”	Here	however,	Barkley	has	heard	not what	was	meant	�	“describe	the	body	which	has	agency,  <i class="calibre3">i.e. </i>	yourself”	�	but what	was	said,	as	if	the	typed	phrase	EXAMINE	ME	were	a	literal	utterance. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p177"></a>Acknowledging	the	presence	of	the	protagonist	was	never	a	problem	for	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">(“Greetings,	Adventurer!”),	but	acknowledging	the	presence	of	the	interactor here	indeed	resembles	a	fourth-wall	violation	in	theatre,	both	as	classically conceived	(a	disruptive	breach	of	craft)	and	in	the	contemporary	sense	(an opportunity).	This	disruptive	opportunity	defamiliarizes	the	audience	from	the expected	norms	of	the	genre	and	enables	the	production	to	provoke	broader questioning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	course,	the	goal	of	such	disruptions	may	be	humor.	Indeed,	just	as	humor became	a	staple	of	parser	error	messages	in	traditional	IF	as	a	method	of rendering	disruptive	error	messages	aesthetic,	experimental	IF	may	disrupt	the interactor	role	as	a	way	of	aesthetically	underscoring	its	own	cleverness	in	the tradition	of	self-referential	literature	and	art.	The	monitor	serves	as	a	theatrical wall	to	be	broken	here	for	humorous	effect.	It	also	recalls	the	computer’s function	not	only	as	a	dividing	wall	but	also	as	a	connecting	channel	(that	may likewise	be	broken). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jon	Ingold’s	Fail-Safe	(2000)	is	a	first	person	work	that	approaches	these layered	and	separates	selves	of	interactor	and	protagonist	without	humor.	Where the	previous	examples	depart	from	the	second	person	by	nodding	or	winking	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘you,’	Ingold	instead	plays	with	their	separation	and	disruption	by	dramatizing	it within	the	story.	With	Captain	Chaos	or	Lord	Barkley,	‘you’	are	a	motive impulse	or	disembodied	voice,	and	the	lack	of	rationale	for	this	becomes	the occasion	for	pointed	humor.	In	Fail-Safe,	by	contrast,	there	is	a	diegetic mechanism	for	that	voice.	The	interactor’s	role	is	as	an	emergency	radio	operator on	line	with	a	crashing	space	vessel,	assisting	the	lone	survivor	in	surveying	the damage	and	preparing	for	an	emergency	landing.	Fail-Safe	dumps	the	interactor into	this	situation,	opening	with	static:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bzzt.	Crackle.  <i class="calibre3">Static</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“…hello?	Hello?	Can…	me?	..	Anyone!	Hel….	Need..	hello?” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“..	help.	Repeat,	can	anybody	hear	me?	Can	you	hear	me?	Hello..” </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;&gt;	HELLO</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello?	Hello!	The	..	&lt;crackle&gt;	pretty	bad.	Are	you	receiving	this?	Over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p178"></a>&gt;&gt;	YES</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	thank	God.	Thank	God..	..emergency	frequency..	We	need	help.	This	is the	space	pod	‘Serpentine’.	We’ve	been	attacked,	a	small	cruiser.

<p class="calibre1">“I’m	by	the	console,	there’s	wires	everywhere.	The	computer	flashing something.	What	do	I	do?	Hello?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;&gt;	WHO	ARE	YOU? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry?	Do..	what?	..I	can’t	hear	you,	too	much	static..” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ingold’s	incorporation	of	the	first	/	second	person	split	(via	the	radio)	in	this work	is	transformative,	influencing	every	aspect	of	his	design.	The	device	of radio	communication	naturalizes	the	use	of	first	person	present	tense,	as	the speaker	(the	protagonist	survivor)	has	a	diegetic	addressee	(the	emergency operator).	It	likewise	naturalizes	the	common	activity	of	requesting	descriptions in	IF.	Now	description	requests	are	no	longer	a	text-based	approximation	of vision,	but	rather	radio	transmissions	with	someone	who	actually	serves	as	“your eyes	and	hands.”	Both	perceptive	and	active	commands	make	sense	in	the context	of	such	transmissions,	as	extremely	limited	knowledge	of	the	situation and	the	need	to	give	simple,	clear	instructions	are	both	normal	conditions	of	the emergency	operator	role.	Perhaps	most	importantly,	the	radio	provides	an	alibi for	any	and	all	parser	limitations.	Rather	than	the	system	addressing	the interactor	with	error	messages	about	incomprehensible	input,	the	survivor responds	to	the	operator,	complaining	about	incomprehensible	transmissions	due to	static. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sum	effect	of	the	radio	communications	link	is	to	justify	the	disabilities and	incapacities	of	the	interactor	as	discourse	(rather	than	characteristics)	yet situate	them	within	a	diegesis.	Unlike	with	alienated	protagonists	(Ch.	3),	here the	root	of	incapacity	is	not	located	in	an	alienating	environment,	nor	in	the physical	or	psychological	limitations	of	the	operator,	but	rather	in	the	disconnect between	motive	impulse	(the	operator)	and	agency	(the	survivor)	as	separate selves.	While	the	survivor	undergoes	the	normal	mode	of	alienation	(here apparently	caused	by	unfamiliar	changes	in	the	damaged	vessel)	the	challenge	of Fail-Safe	is	a	second-order	problem.	The	question	is	not	how	the	survivor	can</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p179"></a>repair	the	ship,	but	how	the	operator	can	direct	such	repair	via	radio.	This distinction	may	seem	like	a	fine	one.	After	all,	so	long	as	a	reason	is	given	for the	command	voice	being	obscured,	what	matter	if	the	difficulty	with	the command	medium	is	either	physical	distance	or	rather	the	id	suppressed	by chemicals,	dementia,	dreams,	and	so	forth?	I	believe	it	is	important,	however, because	the	division	of	impulse	(the	command	line)	and	agency	(the	parser)	into separate	selves	allows	a	clearer	exploration	of	the	issue	of	trust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fail-Safe	is	not	ultimately	about	helping	a	disoriented	survivor,	nor	about repairing	a	ship.	Over	the	course	of	play	small	details	accrue	that	reveal	the survivor	to	be	an	unreliable	interlocutor.	The	sole	survivor	of	an	alien	attack,	he is	suspiciously	unfamiliar	with	his	crewmates	and	ship,	he	fixates	on	odd	details (e.g.	betraying	surprise	that	blood	is	red),	and	his	requests	for	aid	with	the engines	eventually	center	on	enabling	the	ship’s	weapons	systems.	The interactor’s	well-earned	suspicions	are	nurtured	by	the	operator’s	computer, which	calls	up	supplemental	information	on	the	conversation	as	it	progresses,	in effect	fact-checking	the	survivor	without	his	knowledge.	By	the	final	scene	the stage	is	set	to	reverse	normal	interactor-actor	identification,	as	the	‘survivor’	is actually	an	alien	invader	intent	on	infiltrating	the	operator’s	base	in	a	stolen	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hindrance	rather	than	help	should	be	the	operator’s	appropriate	response.	The title	foreshadows	this	reversal	of	expectations.	“Fail-safe”	refers	to	a	backup mechanism	in	the	event	of	breakdown,	but	could	be	read	as	a	solution	to	the process	of	the	work,	as	only	failure	to	accomplish	the	survivor’s	repair	goals leads	to	safety	for	the	operator. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	34.	In	Whalen’s	Space	Refugees	(2006),	the	unarmed	alien	protagonist dodges	as	his	fellow	refugees	are	slaughtered	by	Earth	defenses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	Fail-Safe	is	a	science	fiction	tale	of	xenophobia	and	the	unknown,	its first	person	mode	can	barely	avoid	creating	some	sympathy	for	the	wily,	doomed interloper	and	his	suicide	mission.	An	interesting	comparison	is	Zach	Whalen’s Space	Refugees	(2006),	a	Flash	game	which	inverts	Toshihiro	Nishikado’s classic	arcade	shooter	Space	Invaders	by	putting	the	player	in	control	of	one	of the	unarmed	aliens	facing	slaughter	at	the	hands	of	Earth’s	defenses.	“As	the player’s	character	is	inevitably	disintegrated,	a	flashback	animation	tells	the story	of	the	aliens’	home	world	being	destroyed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Abandoning	the	operator	role	at	the	conclusion	of	Fail-Safe	resonates somewhat	with	Shade’s	final	presentation	of	the	command	line	as	a	relationship</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p180"></a>to	be	understood,	then	discarded.	This	self-defeating	victory	also	recalls	the	hero Wander	from	Shadow	of	the	Colossus	in	that	the	declared	quests	(to	save	the ship	/	defeat	the	colossi)	result	in	self-made	dooms.	They	are	a	type	of	tragedy	in which	the	interactor	takes	unwitting	part.	Fail-Safe	differs	from	Shade	and Shadow	of	the	Colossus	in	allowing	two	resolutions	as	opposed	to	one.	In	one resolution,	the	illusion	is	maintained,	and	the	ship	is	repaired.	This	is	a	victory for	the	unreliable	protagonist	that	has	dire	consequences	for	the	operator.	In	the other	resolution,	the	illusion	is	broken,	with	inverse	results.	A	closer	comparison in	this	regard	is	Adam	Cadre’s	9:05	(1999).	In	this	short	IF	work	the	apparent goal	(getting	to	work	after	oversleeping)	leads	to	catastrophe	for	the	protagonist if	followed	through	(as	it	usually	is),	but	can	be	avoided	on	a	subsequent traversal.	Both	9:05	and	Fail-Safe	encourage	replay	to	get	a	more	complete	or deeper	story,	and	both	reach	conclusions	that	retrospectively	explain	the	odd unfamiliarity	of	their	actors	with	their	environments:	the	actors	are	interlopers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Returning	at	last	to	our	minimal	IF	example,	we	consider	the	significance	of rendering	it	in	the	first	or	third	person.	For	example: I	am	happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	LOOK</p>
<p class="calibre1">Okay,	I	see	Peter,	which	makes	me	unhappy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Who	orders	John	to	look,	by	what	means?	The	subtle	shift	in	emphasis multiplies	the	verb,	with	the	input	changing	from	an	internal	impulse	to	a (spoken?)	command.	“John	was	happy,	then	the	interactor	ordered	him	to	look, so	he	looked,	and	consequently	he	saw	Peter,	which	made	him	unhappy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	long	exploration	may	seem	to	have	sidetracked	us	from	our	discussion	of minimalism,	but	in	a	sense	this	is	the	point.	First	and	third	person	IF	tend	to complicate	the	narrative	and	functional	relationships	between	interactor	and protagonist	by	their	nature,	opening	the	distance	between	the	two	as	separate selves.	For	this	reason,	first	and	third	person	increases	the	need	for	a	framing	tale to	capture	the	separate	self	of	the	interactor	in	the	diegesis;	these	modes	thus encourage	narrative	elaboration.	This	is	not	to	say	that	such	elaboration	is	good or	bad,	nor	must	it	follow	that	the	minimalist	mode	of	IF	(second)	be	the dominant	mode.	Still,	the	fact	that	second	person	is	by	far	the	dominant	mode might	be	telling	about	the	general	relationship	of	IF	to	framing	complexity. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p181"></a>Tense	in	IF:	Past	and	the	problem	of	now Of	all	the	possible	configurations	of	minimal	IF,	we	arrive	last	at	the	one	that is	perhaps	closest	to	Prince’s	example:	tense,	in	particular	the	past	tense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">John	was	happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	LOOK</p>
<p class="calibre1">John	saw	Peter,	which	made	him	unhappy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	now	we	have	indicated	a	confluence	of	factors	that	conspire	to	unravel	past tense	IF	designs,	but	a	number	of	such	designs	exist	and	we	should	consider	past tense	as	it	is	worked	out	in	examples.	As	with	first	or	third	person,	past	tense	is exceptional,	and	as	with	person	the	predominance	of	the	conventional	(present tense)	is	in	part	a	norm	and	in	part	a	design	consideration.	While	second	person narration	is	a	convention	that	helps	the	interactor	to	rationalize	agency,	present tense	narration	is	pitched	to	match	the	present	imperative	tense	of	interactor input	that	is	virtually	an	ironclad	rule	of	all	interactive	fiction	systems, languages,	and	libraries.	I	argue,	in	other	words,	that	just	as	first	and	third	person introduce	discontinuity	between	interactor	and	protagonist	that	complicates	the question	of	who,	the	past	tense	introduces	discontinuity	between	the	simulation output	and	the	command	line	input	that	complicates	the	question	of	when. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imperative	input	is	a	design	decision	so	universal	that	it	almost	escapes	notice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	reason	is	that	the	IF	simulation	is	(nearly	always)	a	time-based representation	that	allows	interventions	at	a	single	moment	(now).	Modeling	it otherwise	raises	a	set	of	very	difficult	aesthetic	and	technical	issues.	By	analogy, consider	Nick	Montfort’s	Winchester’s	Nightmare	(1999),	a	present	tense	work that	is	perhaps	the	best-known	example	of	experimental	third	person	narrative	in IF.	Where	Winchester’s	Nightmare	differs	from	the	examples	given	previously	is in	the	decision	to	replace	the	traditional	input	prompt	(“&gt;”)	with	the	sentence fragment	“Sarah	decides	to.”	This	fragment	is	then	completed	by	user	input: A	shell	lies	in	the	sand	here,	as	if	waiting	for	Sarah	to	pick	it	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sarah	decides	to	PICK	UP	THE	SHELL</p>
<p class="calibre1">So	she	does. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p182"></a>All	the	arguments	given	about	first	and	third	person	thus	far	have	hinged	on the	disidentification	of	the	command	line	with	the	protagonist,	multiplying	them into	two	separate	selves.	Here,	Montfort	sutures	these	separate	selves	by	literally writing	the	protagonist	back	into	the	command	line.	As	a	side	effect	of eliminating	this	invitation	to	ambiguity,	he	simultaneously	removes	the imperative	tense	(and	thus	the	question	of	an	unknown	imperious	persona),	as the	input	PICK	UP	THE	SHELL	is	no	longer	a	command,	but	instead	a statement	of	fact.	Montfort’s	third	person	command	line	radically	changes	the feel	of	the	work,	but	it	maintains	an	interactor-actor	relationship	whose simplicity	is	comparable	to	that	of	the	second	person.	That	this	trick	works	so well	without	having	to	substantially	alter	the	manner	in	which	the	interactor types	input	is	a	weird	testimony	to	the	flexibility	of	the	English	language	in	its simplest	cases.	Atypical	though	it	may	be	for	IF,	it	is	worth	noting	that	this	style translates	well	into	an	even	closer	approximation	of	Prince: John	is	happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">John	decides	to	LOOK</p>
<p class="calibre1">John	sees	Peter,	which	makes	him	unhappy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somewhat	similar	custom-command-line	approaches	have	been	tried	in	the past	tense.	One	notable	recent	attempt	is	Scott	Starkey’s	The	Beetmonger’s Journal	(2001),	whose	frametale	is	narrated	in	the	third	person	past	by	Aubrey Foil,	an	archaeologist’s	assistant.	Starkey’s	work	may	be	the	ultimate	example	of IF	discourse	complexity,	not	because	of	the	intricacy	of	plot	but	because	of	the complexities	that	surround	the	command	line	situation.	The	interactor	is	a listener	or	reader	of	Foil’s,	and	Foil	is	in	turn	a	witness	(after	the	manner	of	Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson	to	Sherlock	Holmes)	to	the	excavations	of	celebrity	archaeologist Monsieur	Lapot.	Here	is	an	excerpt	centered	on	the	first	two	interactions	of	the story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	name	is	Aubrey	Foil,	Monsieur	Lapot’s	chosen	chronicler	and	assistant.	I accompanied	Lapot	during	many	of	his	travels,	and	I	will	endeavor	to	provide you	an	accurate	account	of	what	proved	to	be	his	last	adventure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	did	Monsieur	Lapot	do	next?	&gt;	INVENTORY</p>
<p class="calibre1">Monsieur	Lapot	took	stock	of	his	possessions.	He	had	a	rucksack.	The rucksack	seemed	to	contain	an	archaeologist’s	brush	and	a	halogen	torch. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p183"></a>What	did	he	do	next?	&gt;	EXAMINE	ME</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lapot	looked	over	in	my	direction.	I	stood	close	by,	available	to	offer	my assistance	in	any	way	possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	might	expect	from	the	prompt,	the	command	to	take	inventory	of	one’s possessions	is	acted	upon	by	Lapot,	while	Foil	reports	the	results.	Stranger	is	the result	of	EXAMINE	ME.	The	narrator	we	know	is	Foil,	but	the	reflexive	ME</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	plausibly	refer	to	any	of	these	three	figures:	Lapot,	the	actor,	Foil,	the narrator,	or	the	addressee	who	is	Foil’s	audience.	Given	the	way	that	the convention	of	INVENTORY	was	adapted	from	its	normal	meaning	of	“examine my	inventory,”	we	might	expect	Lapot	to	look	himself	over.	On	the	other	hand, given	the	precedents	discussed	with	Captain	Chaos	and	Lord	Barkley,	we	might expect	ME	to	signify	the	interactor,	and	occasion	a	self-conscious	nod	along	the lines	of	“Lapot	gazed	off	into	space,	as	if	imagining	those	who	would	one	day hear	the	tale	I	tell	you	now.”	Instead	Lapot	acts	on	EXAMINE	ME	as	if	Foil	has spoken	it	(or	rather	willed	it).	Who	addresses	Foil	to	invoke	this	progression	of events,	and	by	what	means?	We	might	avoid	this	problem	by	borrowing Montfort’s	formula	to	shift	out	of	the	imperative	and	banish	the	separate interactor,	using	the	command	line	form	“Monsieur	Lapot	decided	to	EXAMINE</p>
<p class="calibre1">ME.”	With	this	small	change	in	inflection	the	underlying	relationships	of	the code	can	now	be	understood	more	clearly,	and	the	relationship	of	Lapot	to	the actions	(they	are	his	decisions)	and	of	‘ME’	to	its	referent	(Foil	is	the	narrator) make	intuitive	sense.	If	Foil	tells	us	“Lapot	decided	to	examine	me,”	it	makes perfect	sense,	whereas	if	we	told	Foil	that	Lapot	decided	to	“examine	me”	it seems	strange.	In	the	second	person,	questioning	the	audience	and	telegraphing those	suggestions	to	the	protagonist	both	seem	normal,	but	when	these	activities enter	the	diegesis	with	the	third	person,	they	seem	strange.	Yet	the	slightly revised	inflection	“decided	to”	makes	this	strangeness	disappear	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Winchester’s	Nightmare	uses	a	solution	(ban	the	imperative)	that	is	not	used in	The	Beetmonger’s	Journal,	in	part	because	Journal	aspires	to	represent	active agency	in	the	past,	rather	then	paint	a	patina	of	retrospective	description	over	the prospective	command	line.	This	leads	it	to	the	nub	of	a	very	interesting	problem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	normative	second	person	present,	the	command	line	prompt,	“&gt;”	is generally	(although	not	always)	interpreted	as	shorthand	for	“What	do	you	 <i class="calibre3">I	</i> we do	next?”	The	same	simple	verb-noun	phrase	(“GO	NORTH”)	is	logically	and grammatically	consistent	no	matter	which	invisible	phrase	is	imagined	to	be prompting	the	conjoined	self	of	the	interactor	/	protagonist.	This	is	the	same</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p184"></a>consistency	that	Winchester’s	Nightmare	achieves	by	reframing	the	command line.	Yet	the	verbose	command	line	of	The	Beetmonger’s	Journal	cannot	suture the	problem	of	time,	as	we	see	when	we	attempt	to	answer	its	questions	in	kind: What	did	he	do	next?&gt;	HE	WENT	NORTH</p>
<p class="calibre1">[The	word	“went”	is	not	necessary	in	this	game.]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	did	he	do	next?&gt;	GO	NORTH</p>
<p class="calibre1">We	scrambled	through	the	trees	and	up	a	short	incline	to	the	north. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	as	Sarah	decides	to	PICK	UP	THE	SHELL,	the	correct	answer	to	“What did	he	do	next?”	is	HE	WENT	NORTH.	The	parser,	however,	does	not	this	for two	reasons.	The	first	reason	is	an	aesthetic	issue	relating	to	error	messages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imperative	commands	are	in	some	sense	propositions,	and	thus	can	be	refused (“GO	NORTH	�	You	can’t”).	Past	tense	input,	on	the	other	hand,	cannot	be imperative,	and	thus	cannot	be	refused,	only	contradicted.	The	result	would	be	a debate	over	history	(“WENT	NORTH.	No	you	didn’t.	WENT	SOUTH.	No	you didn’t…”),	a	mode	of	interaction	that	threatens	to	become	merely	gainsaying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	second	reason	is	practical,	and	thus	undergirds	the	first:	parsing	past	tense input	is	just	too	much	work.	In	addition	to	dealing	with	verb	irregularity	and needing	a	parallel	architecture,	there	are	other	issues	(such	as	handling	direct address	to	non-protagonists	in	present	tense	within	past	scenes),	and	these	issues multiply	into	system	complexity.	While	simulator	output	can	be	varied	with some	expenditure	of	effort,	present	tense	is	built	into	the	bones	of	IF	command parsers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’ve	arrived,	in	other	words,	at	a	fundamental	underlying	assumption	of	the command	line.	Its	commands	are	always	interactions	with	the	now,	and	this restriction	is	a	limitation	of	both	simulation	model	and	language.	Minimal interactive	fiction	is,	after	all,	about	a	single	interactive	event,	which	is	to	say one	point	in	time	that,	for	the	interactor,	must	in	a	deep	sense	always	be	now.	If the	persistence	of	‘now’	seems	like	a	truism	about	interaction,	it	is	also	intended as	a	provocation	�	the	exemplary	works	of	minimalist	IF	that	are	analyzed	at length	in	the	second	part	of	the	chapter	all	reduce	interactivity	to	the	nub	of	now as	a	means	of	questioning,	disrupting,	and	dissolving	the	role	of	time	in	the progress	of	storytelling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Activity,	reactivity,	and	interactivity</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p185"></a>But	before	we	go	on	to	talk	about	one-move	IF	and	time-loop	fiction,	an interlude.	Having	spent	some	time	on	what	is	sufficient	for	minimal	interactivity, we	can	now	look	briefly	at	the	insufficient	cases	that	are	themselves	the components	of	minimal	interactivity:	activity	and	reactivity.	This	changes	our focus	from	surplus	complexity	and	excess	to	lack	and	insufficiency.	First example:</p>
<p class="calibre1">You	are	happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	are	unhappy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	might	be	termed	“minimal	activity.”	The	system	prints	two	simulated states,	but	the	action	of	the	simulation	cannot	be	said	to	react	to	or	interact	with anything.	For	that	we	need	external	input.	Here	is	an	example	that	accepts	input and	then	reacts:</p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	JUMP</p>
<p class="calibre1">You	jump	on	the	spot,	fruitlessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	this	example	omits	an	initial	state,	and	for	this	reason	it	is	better	described as	an	example	of	“minimal	reactivity.”	Without	an	initial	context	the	user	can only	act	(rather	than	react),	while	in	the	face	of	unilateral	action	the	system	can only	react	(rather	than	interact).	We	can	thus	say	that	interaction	is	the	third	stage of	negotiated	agency.	An	interactive	act	is	a	reaction	to	a	reaction,	or	a	re-reaction,	at	which	point	the	feedback	loop	closes	and	responses	become	mutual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	previous	example	the	actor	fails	to	close	the	loop	and	thus	fails	to	become an	interactor.	In	the	following	corollary,	the	simulation	might	likewise	fail	to	re-react:</p>
<p class="calibre1">You	are	happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	LOOK</p>
<p class="calibre1">This	example	is	again	only	a	corollary	of	minimal	reactivity;	without providing	a	response,	the	simulation	cannot	be	said	to	have	interacted.	Here, however,	the	reacting	party	is	the	user	rather	than	the	system.	From	the	user’s point	of	view,	the	distinction	is	dramatic;	the	earlier	system	may	provide	varied responses	to	blind	input,	while	the	later	system	will	listen	to	the	user,	but	will never	respond.	Both	cases	are	examples	of	minimal	reactivity,	but	each	is	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p186"></a>very	different	nature.	This	illustrates	that	it	is	not	enough	merely	to	note	the presence	of	activity,	reactivity,	or	interactivity	in	relation	to	minimal	systems. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	must	also	identify	where	and	how	it	appears	in	the	process	of	user-system engagement.	We	can	begin	by	distinguishing	in	minimal	cases	between	the presence	of	an	interactive	user	and	an	interactive	system.	The	interactive	user	(or interactor)	has	the	opportunity	to	re-react:</p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	LOOK</p>
<p class="calibre1">You	see	Peter,	which	makes	you	unhappy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	LEAVE</p>
<p class="calibre1">Conversely,	the	interactive	system	corresponds	to	the	Prince	adaptation	we began	with:</p>
<p class="calibre1">You	are	happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	LOOK</p>
<p class="calibre1">You	see	Peter,	which	makes	you	unhappy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both	satisfy	a	minimal	case,	but	with	different	emphasis.	Scholarship	on interactivity	and	interactive	media	is	generally	more	concerned	with	this	second example,	interactive	systems	(interactive	behavior	being	presumed	unremarkable in	humans,	while	remarkable	in	machines).	In	minimal	cases,	however,	we	can observe	unilateral	interactive	acts	and	differentiate	between	minimal	interactivity for	user	and	system.	One	important	consequence	of	this	distinction	is	that	we	can now	talk	about	forms	of	interactivity	that	are	not	necessarily	a	symmetrical engagement.	Another	is	that	we	can	now	distinguish	formally	between asymmetrical	and	symmetrical	interactivity	�	between	minimally	interactive systems,	and	their	superset,	minimally	interactive	sessions.	In	systems,	such	as our	first	Prince-inspired	example,	the	software	participant	re-reacts,	whereas	in sessions,	both	participants	re-react.	An	interactive	session	involves	at	least	two complete	cycles	of	the	feedback	loop	(e.g.	two	inputs	and	outputs),	performed jointly.	Any	further	actions	pass	out	of	the	realm	of	minimalism	and	into	an ongoing	interactive	session. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	are	happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p187"></a>&gt;	LOOK</p>
<p class="calibre1">You	see	Peter,	which	makes	you	unhappy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;LEAVE</p>
<p class="calibre1">You	no	longer	see	Peter,	which	makes	you	happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two-move	IF	works,	in	other	words,	are	symmetrical	sessions,	whereas	one-move	IF	works	are	asymmetrical	systems.	Having	carefully	built	up	this distinction,	however,	we	can	complicate	it	with	a	crucial	exception.	The	user	is uniquely	able	to	react	to	a	one-move,	minimally	interactive	system	almost	as	if fully	interacting,	so	long	as	she	has	the	ability	to	continually	restart	the	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	can	be	done	with	a	judicious	bit	of	cheating	called	human	memory.	If	the user	simply	restarts	the	simulation	and	then	re-reacts	differently	based	on	the	last response,	this	creates	a	reasonable	facsimile	of	minimal	(and,	indeed,	ongoing) interactivity	on	her	part	(with	some	caveats	�	for	example,	action	in	the simulation	cannot	proceed	serially,	only	in	parallel).	The	user	becomes	an interactor	as	a	kind	of	time-traveler,	living	out	a	lifespan	longer	than	that	of	the simulated	world	�	an	idea	played	with	in	the	many	time-loop	fictions	we	will soon	consider. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Minimalism	and	aesthetics	in	IF	and	games</p>
<p class="calibre1">While	it	is	true	that	the	pure	minimal	IF	works	are	one-move,	and	it	is	true that	one-move	works	have	properties	such	as	reactive	users	that	encourage	time-traveling	reading,	it	is	important	to	remember	that	minimal	IF,	while	in	some sense	definitive,	remain	deeply	atypical.	The	notable	one-move	IF	that	have been	written	number	only	a	handful	of	highly	experimental,	plainly	outrageous, or	deeply	strange	works. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	is	also	a	danger	that	the	relationship	between	IF	and	minimalism	will	be misunderstood.	IF	interface	structures	and	diegetic	relationships	tend	towards minimalism,	while	IF	simulations	are	historically	excessive.	Interface minimalism	should	not	be	confused	with	simulation	minimalism,	any	more	than Eisner’s	sequential	presentation	should	be	confused	with	sequential apprehension.	Yet	the	idea	of	IF	simulation	as	minimalist	is	widespread.	Text adventure	games	and	IF	are	often	perceived	in	our	contemporary	game	and media	art	culture	as	signifying	a	kind	of	radical	asceticism	on	the	part	of	their authors	and	audiences.	This	misperception	largely	arises	out	of	a	small	set	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p188"></a>historical	misunderstandings	�	the	assumption	that	text	adventure	games preceded	video	games	(they	did	not),	the	assumption	that	text	adventure	games were	evidently	limited	compared	to	their	graphical	counterparts	(they	were	not), and	the	inference	that	contemporary	IF	authors	and	audiences	must	eschew graphics	in	order	to	deny	themselves	modern	luxuries	(e.g.	3D	physics	engines) and	that	such	self-denial	must	therefore	arise	out	of	a	self-disciplinary	ideology akin	to	monasticism	or	stoicism	(it	does	not).	This	last	inference	is	easy	to address	on	its	own.	In	practice,	most	contemporary	IF	interactors	are	not	morally opposed	to	graphics	any	more	than	most	contemporary	equestrians	are	morally opposed	to	cars.	Certainly	the	use	of	the	horse	has	changed	dramatically	in automotive	societies,	just	as	the	uses	of	IF	have	changed	in	the	presence	of graphics.	The	analogy	is	appealing,	yet	it	may	encourage	us	to	naturalize	text parsers	as	“pre-graphics,”	which	is	not	the	case.	Most	graphical	game	types predate	command	line	based	text	adventure	games.	Some	landmarks	include	the first	computer	game	(Chris	Strachey’s	checkers,	1951),	the	first	distributed computer	video	game	(Steve	Russell	et.	al’s	Spacewar!,	1962),	the	first	coin-op arcade	games	(Computer	Space,	1971	and	Pong,	1972)	and	the	first	mass-produced	home	console	system	(The	Magnavox	Odyssey,	1972).	Given	these precedents,	the	first	text	adventure	game	in	fact	arrived	quite	late	on	the	scene (Will	Crowther’s	Colossal	Cave	Adventure,	1976).	By	the	time	Crowther	and Wood’s	Adventure	had	been	widely	distributed	and	its	descendents	(Infocom’s Zork	I-III)	had	been	central	to	shaping	the	home	computer	game	industry	in	the early	1980s,	text	adventure	games	were	becoming	mass	phenomena	alongside	a robust	second-generation	of	video	game	consoles	(e.g.	the	Atari	2600,	1977), video	arcade	games	(e.g.	Toshihiro	Nishikado’s	Space	Invaders,	1978),	and computer	games	(e.g.	Rogue,	1980).	Rather	than	being	a	precursor	to	graphics simulation,	in	other	words,	IF	emerged	at	the	historical	moment	of	all	these second	generations.	It	was	already	in	dialog	with	graphical	games	from	its conception.	Contemporary	IF	players	also	play	graphical	games,	just	as	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">players	always	have,	yet	IF	has	come	to	signify	a	different	alternative	mode	than it	once	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although	it	may	seem	counterintuitive	today,	IF	aesthetics	began	not	in austerity	but	rather	in	expansive	excess,	pushing	at	the	limits	of	that	era’s available	hardware,	software,	storage,	and	implementation	languages.	In	the beginning,	Crowther	and	Woods’s	Adventure	was	radically	expansive, suggesting	a	kind	of	limitless	experience	undreamt	of	by	the	sharply	constrained arcade	or	console	offerings	of	their	contemporaries.	Adventure	is	a	work	about exploration	which	was	simultaneously	itself	an	exploration	of	programming</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p189"></a>simulations.	On	the	one	hand,	it	was	a	cavern	crawl	consisting	of	many	hundreds of	rooms	and	objects	explored	over	an	indefinite	period,	and	on	the	other,	an open	code	base	ported	across	many	languages	and	in	many	styles,	constantly aggregating	ideas	and	innovations.	As	it	circulated	through	numerous adaptations	and	revisions,	Adventure	tended	to	accumulate	objects,	places,	and events	like	an	ever-expanding	miscellany:	an	early	canonical	version	awarded 350	points	for	treasures	found	and	tasks	accomplished,	while	some	later	versions awarded	370	points,	430	points,	550	points,	and	660	points	for	interactions	with new	objects	and	puzzles	ranging	over	a	radically	expanded	landscape	of locations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	this	is	not	to	say	that	the	scope	of	simulation	in	IF	is	never	minimalist,	just that	trends	towards	minimal	scope	such	as	the	one	room	sub-genre	and	the	one move	sub-genre	are	primarily	a	late	development	in	IF,	and	that	this	recent minimalism	is	rarely	ascetic.	Eschewing	graphics	or	indeed	anything	else	is generally	beside	the	point	of	contemporary	IF	experimentalism.	This	distinction is	important	to	understanding	two	trends	in	IF	works	of	the	last	decade:	one trend	towards	greater	unity	of	interaction	(sharply	limited	spaces	or	time,	fewer interactions	and	shorter	traversals)	and	the	other	trend	towards	increased	system intricacy	(rich	descriptive	environments,	complex	objects	and	custom	verbs). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus,	in	sharp	contrast	to	the	prototypically	expansive	locations,	objects,	and durations	of	Adventure,	a	contemporary	IF	work	such	as	Andrew	Plotkin’s Shade	(2000)	is	set	in	one	room	and	involves	interactions	with	a	small	list	of objects	over	the	course	of	a	few	short	hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	the	average	traversal	length	of	works	has	dropped,	our	culture	doesn’t have	a	consistent	story	to	tell	about	what	limited	scope	or	shorter	interaction time	means.	At	various	points	in	history	videogames	have	been	criticized	both for	encouraging	short	reflex-style	play	(antisocial,	addictive	repetition-compulsion)	and	for	long	sustained	strategic	play	(antisocial,	escapist immersion).	Narratives	that	demonize	one	sometimes	describe	positively socialized	game	behaviors	as	the	opposite.	Nowhere	is	this	more	evident	than	in reversals	of	common	wisdom	surrounding	arcade	and	console	games.	By	1980, arcade	games	such	as	Space	Invaders	and	home	video	game	consoles	such	as	the Atari	2600	were	held	accountable	for	addictive-pattern	behavior	gaming	�	as pinball	had	been	since	at	least	the	1930s	and	slot	machines	since	the	1890s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Infocom	advertised	IF	in	contrast	to	this:	long,	contemplative	works	that	were about	reflection	and	immersion,	not	fast-twitch	zombie-hood	(I	Was	A	Teenage Zombie,	1983).	The	zombie	pictured	is	what	we	might	call	the	1980	concept	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p190"></a>the	“hardcore	gamer”	�	someone	who	plays	to	a	socially	unacceptable	level (like	socially	unacceptable	levels	of	reading,	etc.)	The	concept	of	the	“hardcore gamer”	by	2000,	however,	had	been	changed	by	three	generations	of	home	game consoles.	Critiques	of	console	gamers	now	described	players	obsessed	with complex	play	mechanics	and	extremely	wide-scoped	content,  <i class="calibre3">e.g. </i>	a	game	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">“40	hours	of	content”	on	the	disk.	Contrast	this	with	Space	Invaders	or	Pac-Man, which	focused	on	the	same	game	(taking	1-5	minutes	to	win)	played	as	“levels” </p>
<p class="calibre1">over	and	over	again	with	slightly	increased	difficulty	until	skill	failed	or boredom	set	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	dangerously	addictive	(simple	reflex,	repetition-compulsion)	hardcore games	of	the	late	1970s	and	early	1980s	are	more	comparable	to	what	are	now called	“casual	games.”	These	are	games	with	simple	mechanics	and	the	potential for	short	gameplay	sessions.	In	fact,	many	popular	casual	games	today	are	the dangerously	addictive	hardcore	games	of	generations	past	�	clones	of	games like	Tetris	or	Pac	Man	available	on	an	ever-expanding	range	of	portable	devices from	the	Game	Boy	(1989)	to	contemporary	cellphones	and	PDAs.	In	recent years	the	video	game	industry	has	been	slowly	reawakened	to	the	widespread appeal	and	economic	potential	of	“casual	games”	�	first	as	an	online	market and	then	as	a	major	target	demographic	for	seventh-generation	consoles	such	as the	Nintendo	Wii	(2006).	Casual	games	are	currently	so-called	in	marked contrast	to	simply	“games”	by	an	industry	that	until	recently	has	been conceptually	dominated	(especially	in	the	console	space)	by	the	“hardcore gamer,”	a	marketing	profile	of	an	industry-driving	video	game	consumer	which has	(as	noted)	shifted	significantly	over	time,	and	is	now	in	the	process	of shifting	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	important	point	here	is	that	the	terms	“casual	/	hardcore”	denote	styles	of play	session	(long	/	short),	while	game	designs	may	vary	drastically	in	the	time	it takes	to	traverse	their	content.	Pac	Man	might	take	2-3	minutes	to	finish	a	stage, with	the	content	of	every	subsequent	level	being	functionally	identical,	whereas Shadow	of	the	Colossus	might	take	an	hour	or	two	to	finish	a	stage,	with	perhaps 20-30	hours	of	radically	varied	content	before	experiencing	the	game’s	final scenes.	What	is	important	is	that	this	says	little	about	how	long	and	how	often the	game	is	played	(although	casual	games	and	minigames	are	arguably	more friendly	to	certain	play	styles).	The	most	reductive	form	of	minigame	or microgame	would	consist	of	a	single	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	time	loop:	Aisle,	Shrapnel,	and	Rematch</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p191"></a>Sam	Barlow’s	Aisle	(1999)	and	Andrew	Pontious’s	Rematch	(2000)	are	both examples	of	IF	works	with	apparently	minimal	traversals	consisting	of	a	single move.	For	Aisle,	this	move	is	a	moment	in	the	emotional	life	of	a	man	as	he passes	down	the	pasta	aisle	of	a	supermarket.	For	Rematch,	this	move	is	a moment	in	the	progress	of	a	game	of	pool	just	before	it	is	interrupted	by	a	fatal car	crash.	Unlike	the	Silence	of	the	Lambs	example	of	a	minimal	traversal	that begins	this	chapter,	however,	Aisle	and	Rematch	are	minimal	in	length	but expansively	complex	in	breadth	of	possible	outcomes,	anticipating	more	replay (if	not	more	total	moves)	than	is	usual	for	a	short	work	of	IF	by	a	couple	orders of	magnitude.	The	expected	mode	of	engagement	is	cyclical,	constantly	exiting and	re-entering	the	space	of	interaction.	In	doing	so	the	interactor	engages	the limits	and	constraints	of	both	the	possibility	space	and	the	traversal	length.	Thus the	edges	of	the	work	become	even	more	important	to	the	experience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These	IF	works	are	characterized	by	the	tropes	of	a	larger	family	of	fiction which	I	term	“time	loop	fiction.”	Time	loop	fictions	are	not	gardens	of	forking paths,	nor	labyrinths,	but	worlds	that	end	only	to	begin	again,	which	is	to	say that	the	time	loop	is	a	minimal	case	of	the	restartable	or	replayable	simulation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Time	loops	have	appeared	in	many	forms.	The	time	loop	is	presented	in	myths and	philosophies	of	history	such	as	Giambattista	Vico’s	monograph	Scienza Nuova	(1730),	which	narrates	history	as	three	cyclical	recurrent	ages	connected by	a	chaotic	ricurso	or	return.	The	time	loop	has	structured	novels	such	as	James Joyce’s	Finnegans	Wake	(1939),	which	both	references	Vico	and	enacts	his ricurso	when	its	final	phrase	“along	the…”	recirculates	and	reconnects	to	its opening	“…riverrun,”	redirecting	the	text	into	a	giant	circle.	The	time	loop	also appears	in	a	large	number	of	late	20th	century	films	such	as	the	Harold	Ramis film	Groundhog	Day	(1993),	which	follows	a	weatherman	who	is	forced	to constantly	relive	the	same	day),	and	a	multitude	of	interactive	fiction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	35.	Simulation	fictions	at	the	intersection	of	variation	/	repetition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Part	of	the	interest	in	the	time	loop	as	an	aesthetic	strategy	relates	to	its	function as	both	an	escape	valve	for	the	limits	of	minimal	fiction	 <i class="calibre3">simulation	and	an</i> <i class="calibre3">extension	of	those	limits.	The	time	loop	takes	surrounding	questions	of</i> <i class="calibre3">repeatability	and	replayability	that	exist	only	at	the	level	of	the	reader	</i> interactor and	incorporates	them	into	the	diegesis	of	the	work.	Repetition	with	variation	is the	normal	condition	of	re-engaging	all	art,	but	simulation-based	artworks	such as	IF	are	based	in	a	more	specific	tension	between	constant	structure	and variable	interaction,	and	it	is	this	more	specific	tension	that	the	time	loop</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p192"></a>describes.	For	this	reason	it	is	important	that	we	distinguish	the	narrow	category of	the	time	loop	and	its	narratively	enacted	ricursos	from	a	much	broader	class	of narratively	represented	variations	we	might	term	“time	fiction.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Time	fictions	take	place	under	the	mark	of	implied	variation	but	do	not necessarily	engage	repeatability	or	replayability	in	any	meaningful	way.	The most	prominent	examples	of	time	fiction	are	technological	and	magical interventions	in	causality	such	as	time	travel	fictions	(primarily	science	fiction and	fantasy).	There	are	many	other	types,	however.	Allohistorical	fictions	vary (often	silently)	from	an	assumed	history,	and	may	appear	either	fantastic	(e.g. </p>
<p class="calibre1">steampunk)	or	realistic	(e.g.	geopolitical	scenario	fictions	of	alternate	wars	and empires).	Finally,	time	fictions	include	what	I	term	allomemorial	fictions: remembrances	of	things	past,	recollections	in	tranquility,	or	indeed	any narrations	which	are	strongly	marked	by	their	presumed	difference	from	the	fact of	their	original	events.	To	the	degree	that	any	narration	is	a	self-aware	retelling and	re-engagement,	it	already	appears	under	the	sign	of	variation,	a	variation	that time	travel	(interventionism),	and	allohistory	(systemicism)	simply	explores	in its	more	specific	instances. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	basis	of	the	time	loop	is	scene	repetition,	a	feature	that	no	other constituent	group	of	time	fiction	(time	travel	fiction,	allohistory,	etc.)	either necessitates	or	excludes.	Scene	repetitions	can	be	structural	or	enacted.	On	the one	hand,	the	body	of	the	work	can	form	the	matter	of	a	single	loop	structurally, as	in	print	fictions	such	as	Joyce’s	Finnegans	Wake	or	Mark	Danielewski’s	Only Revolutions,	with	a	complete	traversal	of	the	text	and	a	complete	traversal	of	the loop	being	the	same.	Here,	rereading	is	invited,	yet	the	text	itself	excludes variation	from	repetitions	of	the	single	loop.	On	the	other	hand,	the	body	of	the work	can	enact	repetition,	becoming	a	meta-space	in	which	variation	is demonstrated,	such	as	in	the	Rubin	and	Ramis	film	Groundhog	Day,	which revisits	some	scenes	(e.g.	the	moment	of	waking	up)	dozens	of	times	with variations	large	and	small.	Simulation	fictions	such	as	video	games	or	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">introduce	variation	via	interaction,	yet	they	may	model	the	time	loop	in	either manner.	On	the	one	hand,	they	may	form	a	simple	loop	that	continually	restarts (as	Aisle	does,	after	the	fashion	of	Finnegans	Wake).	On	the	other	hand,	they may	represent	a	progressive	sequence	of	complex	variations	(as	Rematch	does, after	the	fashion	of	Groundhog	Day).	While	these	two	pairs	of	works	manage	the process	of	variation	differently,	all	four	locate	the	experience	of	frustration	and alienation	less	in	the	figures	of	their	protagonists	than	in	the	special	state	of	the worlds,	which	are	either	dreams	exhibiting	heavy	Freudian	condensation	or	else</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p193"></a>traps	of	space-time	crafted	by	something	mystical	or	divine.	The	way	in	which the	scenario	suggests	the	separation	of	being	from	time	is	what	gives	time	loop fiction	its	existential	tenor	and	philosophical	force. </p>

<p class="calibre1">�	Introduction	to	Aisle</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	Barlow’s	Aisle	(1999)	is	such	an	existential	IF,	a	fragmented,	ambiguous set	of	narratives	all	anchored	by	a	brief	moment	in	the	pasta-and-sauce	aisle	of	a grocery	store.	Each	time	a	command	is	entered,	the	narrative	generates	a	brief passage	that	describes	a	memory,	an	action,	or	a	possible	future,	then immediately	begins	again.	All	potentials	begin	in	the	interactor’s	control	over	a single	moment	in	the	life	of	a	protagonist	(or	set	of	protagonists)	we	will	call</p>
<p class="calibre1">“the	shopper.”	The	possible	resolutions	for	the	shopper	are	wide	ranging, including	a	quiet	dinner	alone,	an	assault,	a	date	that	leads	to	engagement,	and	a descent	into	madness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aisle	is	widely	credited	within	IF	for	as	pioneering	the	concept	of	the	“one-move”	sub-genre,	although	as	we	have	seen	Silence	of	the	Lambs	is	an	earlier one-move	work	from	1996.	In	addition	to	being	serious	in	tone,	Aisle	differs	in the	breadth	of	its	possibilities,	and	this	changes	the	degree	to	which	the	work feels	characterized	by	durations	of	a	single	input.	Silence	of	the	Lambs	is	a	work waiting	for	a	single	input,	but	until	that	input	(and	no	other)	is	given	the interactor	is	suspended	at	the	command	line,	with	some	inputs	handled incidentally	(as	window	dressing)	and	other	inputs	trapped	by	generic	error messages	that	are	the	inherited	voice	of	the	library:</p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	EXAMINE	LAMBS</p>
<p class="calibre1">They’re	bleating	quite	noisily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	CONFUSE	PARSER</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	don’t	know	the	word	“confuse.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p194"></a>Structurally,	Aisle	functions	in	exactly	the	same	way,	with	disambiguation	and special	handling	allowing	several	turns,	and	all	other	inputs	trapped	by	generic error	messages.	Because	a	true	action,	move,	or	turn	has	not	yet	occurred,	in each	case	control	returns	to	the	interactor	for	yet	another	input:</p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	REMEMBER</p>
<p class="calibre1">You’ll	have	to	say	what	you	want	to	remember. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	CONFUSE	PARSER</p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	not	a	verb	I	recognise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	distinction	between	a	simple	input	and	the	more	complex	idea	of	a	move is	pervasive	in	IF	architecture.	An	input	is	generally	any	command	that	is entered	into	the	command	line.	A	move,	by	contrast,	is	generally	any	command that	is	parsed,	understood,	refers	to	the	diegesis	rather	than	a	meta-level	such	as save-restore,	is	acted	upon,	and	advances	time.	While	there	are	a	number	of	one-move	works,	there	are	currently	no	one-input	works.	Neither	Silence	of	the Lambs	nor	Aisle	forces	all	inputs	to	resolve	as	events.	Rather,	they	wait	for understanding.	By	changing	the	breadth	of	implementation,	however,	Aisle causes	the	inputs	to	resolve	the	vast	majority	of	the	time.	An	interactor	with Silence	of	the	Lambs	might	load	the	work,	attempt	to	look	around	or	affect	the empty	farm	locale	for	a	few	inputs,	resolve	the	text	(SILENCE	LAMBS)	and then	poke	around	a	bit	more	before	quitting.	The	majority	of	her	interactions would	occur	in	a	state	of	suspension,	with	input	not	resolving	to	action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	contrast,	the	great	majority	of	Aisle	interactions	produce	resolutions,	and this	difference	in	degree	feels	like	a	difference	in	kind.	In	walkthrough documentation	available	for	the	work,	Barlow	includes	a	list	of	“all	136	actions that	produce	endings”	(although	these	outcomes	map	against	a	significantly larger	set	of	input	words	and	phrases).	Printing	a	transcript	of	these	136	typed commands	and	their	corresponding	unique	responses	renders	roughly	60	pages of	prose.	This	transcript	still	excludes	several	pages	of	incidental	non-resolving interactions	such	as	disambiguation	(e.g.	REMEMBER)	and	meta-verb interactions	(e.g.	ABOUT,	AUTHOR,	CREDITS,	HELP,	SAVE,	QUIT, RESTART,	RESTORE,	VERSION).	Perhaps	more	important	than	this	raw	scope is	the	completeness	of	implementation:	the	work	affords	a	fairly	large	number	of nouns	and	verbs,	most	of	which	resolve.	Consider	the	opening	passage:</p>

The	word	pasta	cannot	be	merely	selected	(or typed	in),	although	the	simulated	pasta	can	be	examined,	taken,	given,	eaten, broken,	thrown,	and	forgotten	(among	other	things). </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	effect	of	such	an	approach	towards	exhaustive	implementation	is	that Aisle	interactions	are	typified	by	resolution.	Another	effect	is	that	messages written	by	the	author	largely	replace	another	voice	that	is	typically	present	in most	IF	works:	the	default,	built-in	responses	to	stock	actions	that	make	up	the voice	of	the	library.	Contemporary	IF	works	are	generally	built	with development	languages	(e.g.	Inform	and	TADS)	that	come	with	default messages	that	handle	a	wide	variety	of	fundamental	situations.	Even	though	the authored	source	code	of	the	work	makes	no	apparent	reference	to	the	verb	or input	pattern,	a	normal	statement	at	the	top	of	the	source	that	includes	standard code	library	of	resources	and	behaviors	(a	header	file)	causes	the	behavior	to become	part	of	the	work.	Some	messages	handle	meta-level	interactions	(e.g. </p>
<p class="calibre1">RESTART	“Are	you	sure	you	want	to	start	over?”)	or	return	generic	parsing error	messages	(e.g.	“That’s	not	a	verb	I	recognise”).	No	matter	how	innocuous, however,	it	is	important	to	recognize	that	the	development	library	header-files and	the	programmer’s	authored	text	co-exist	in	the	work,	and	that	the	production of	text	during	interaction	is	usually	complex	and	multi-vocal.	Very	few	works	of IF	completely	customize	or	replace	this	default	text,	and	consequences	can	range from	the	dull	(e.g.	the	remarkable	sameness	of	meta-interaction	text	across otherwise	disparate	works)	through	the	odd	(e.g.	British	spellings	such	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">“recognise”	appearing	amidst	text	that	is	otherwise	normalized	to	American spelling)	to	the	bizarre,	as	in	this	interaction	with	Silence	of	the	Lambs:</p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	JUMP</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p197"></a>Wheeee! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Musante	did	not	author	this	response.	Rather,	it	is	the	default	text	inherited from	the	TADS	2	library,	and	meant	to	indicate	(playfully,	in	the	tradition	of Adventure	and	Zork)	that	the	verb	is	not	appropriate	or	consequential	in	context. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although	something	like	“Your	jumping	further	agitates	the	lambs”	might	have been	more	to	the	point,	overall	the	default	response	has	no	serious	repercussions for	a	light-hearted	and	thinly	implemented	work.	Since	the	text	is	blindly inherited,	however,	a	work	set	at	the	top	of	a	cliff	or	focalized	through	a protagonist	in	a	wheelchair	can	both	inherit	the	highly	inappropriate	response</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wheeee!”	unless	anticipated	and	prevented	by	the	author.	While	Aisle	is	written in	Inform	6,	which	defines	its	own	default	for	JUMP,	this	default	has	been replaced	by	custom	text:</p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;JUMP</p>
<p class="calibre1">Staring	at	the	gnocchi	you	feel	a	memory	slowly,	awkwardly,	awfully	rise	to the	surface. </p>
<p class="calibre1">-The	scooter	driver	looks	surprised.	You	grab	for	Clare	and	jump	to	the	side-bounce	across	the	road,	scrape	your	head—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scuffed	and	light	headed	you	open	your	eyes…	your	hands	are	empty-Clare	is a	few	metres	away,	lying	awkwardly.	Splattered	with	a	thin	red	liquid,	reflecting the	scooter’s	bright	red	paintwork. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	scooter	skids-you	jump.	You	are	in	the	supermarket.	Your	hands	are empty,	sweaty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">–––-</p>
<p class="calibre1">A	story	finished.	But	there	are	others…</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	have	again	added	the	bolded	text	here	to	indicate	strings	useable	in	crafting future	inputs.	Most	of	the	major	nouns	in	the	passage	were	in	fact	already present	in	the	initial	passage	(e.g.	GNOCCHI,	SUPERMARKET),	and	only	a few	(e.g.	DRIVER)	are	unaddressable,	reflecting	Aisle’s	high	degree	of	focused interiority.	One	(CLARE)	is	not	present	in	the	initial	passage,	but	is	pervasive throughout	most	other	passages,	and	thus	probably	already	familiar	to	the interactor.	One	(JUMP)	is	self-referential.	By	first	suggesting	this	term,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p198"></a>interactor	has	subsequently	discovered	it	in	the	text.	The	word	SCOOTER, however,	is	new.	After	the	coda	line,	the	screen	refreshes,	Aisle	restarts,	and	we re-confront	the	opening	lexia	about	the	aisle.	It	is	a	text	we	will	come	to	see hundreds	of	times,	and	it	will	gradually	grow	invisible	to	us	with	repetition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead	of	re-engaging	the	visual	passage,	however,	we	can	instead	think	about the	possibility	space	exposed	thus	far.	Time	has	restarted	for	the	simulation,	but not	the	interactor,	who	can	choose	to	elaborate	her	exploration.	As	she	explores, the	implied	code	expands	in	her	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;THINK	ABOUT	SCOOTER</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	accident.	You	had	joked	about	the	traffic,	over	the	previous	days.	There	is something	about	scooters	and	Italians	that	is	comical.	But	the	thin	veneer	of blood	soon	takes	that	away.	You	can’t	remember	much	more	than	the	skid,	the collision	and	the	shock.	Friends	and	relatives	organised	everything-getting	the body	flown	over,	the	police,	the	papers,  <i class="calibre3">etc. </i>	Gave	you	room	to	grieve.	But	you’ll always	remember	the	way	the	scooter	flicked	her	into	the	air	as	if	she	were	a feather.	And	the	way	she	fell	as	if	she	were	lead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shopping	doesn’t	seem	so	important-well,	still	as	important,	just	not	as	easy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">–––-</p>
<p class="calibre1">One	more	story	over.	Not	the	only	one…</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again,	the	comparison	and	disjunction	is	with	literary	hypertext,	whose	lexias branch	out	to	still	further	lexias.	If	we	were	to	name	clusters	of	passages	by	the nouns	that	evoke	them	and	then	organize	those	clusters	in	a	map	with	links	from the	literal	words	in	the	passages,	we	would	have	something	like	a	hypertext approximation	of	Aisle,	although	the	experience	of	navigation	(as	opposed	to exploration)	would	be	quite	different.	Here	the	interactor	may	make	similar explorations,	but	the	process	is	not	spatial	mapping	as	in	hyperlinked	link navigation.	Instead,	the	replaying	interactor	summons	the	scooter,	not	from	the current	lexia,	but	from	her	mind.	Of	course,	she	may	not	choose	the	scooter	at	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">�	at	least,	not	literally.	The	input	REMEMBER	ACCIDENT	renders	the	exact same	lexia,	even	though	neither	the	word	“accident”	nor	the	verb	“remember” </p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared	anywhere	in	the	scooter	passage	that	originally	prompted	exploration (“wandering	outcry”)	in	this	direction.	The	guiding	principle	of	Aisle	interaction is	not	what	words	lie	on	the	surface	of	the	work,	but	what	objects	and	ideas	it</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p199"></a>contains	and	what	it	is	about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	exactly	is	Aisle	about?	The	narrative,	as	the	introduction	indicates,	is unstable,	with	many	different	strongly	characterized	figures	all	resolving	as	a single	‘you’	figure.	This	unstable	protagonist	figure,	here	called	“the	shopper,”	is varied	and	yet	coherent.	Some	versions	of	the	shopper	are	very	old	or	quite young,	but	all	versions	are	adult	males,	and	all	are	touched	by	disquiet.	Most versions	of	the	shopper	are	single,	lonely,	and	socially	awkward	to	varying degrees.	Many	versions	are	struggling	with	depression,	grief,	guilt,	rage, obsession,	paranoia,	nervous	breakdown,	or	even	insanity.	Aisle	introduces many	characters	in	passing,	but	it	has	a	cast	of	only	three	major	characters,	two of	whom	are	mentioned	in	the	opening	passage:	the	shopper,	and	an	unfamiliar brunette	woman	who	is	shopping	on	the	same	aisle.	This	woman	is	herself multiple	both	in	personalities	and	possibilities,	but	her	transcendental	character is	her	unfamiliarity:	there	is	no	possible	outcome	in	which	the	shopper	will recognize	her	as	someone	already	significant	in	his	life.	The	third	major character	in	Aisle	is	the	shopper’s	absent	romantic	partner,	Clare.	Importantly, neither	her	existence	nor	her	absence	is	specified	in	the	opening	passage,	but	she is	either	named	or	strongly	implied	in	the	majority	of	Aisle	outcomes.	In	her varying	incarnations	Clare	symbolizes	many	kinds	of	past	loss:	abandonment, death	by	accident,	illness,	murder,	suicide,	and	more.	The	unfamiliar	brunette,	by contrast,	is	the	most	tangible	sign	of	a	possible	present	or	future	resolution, albeit	often	a	negative	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	opening	configuration	of	loneliness-and-a-stranger	is	reflected	in	the relative	implementation	depth	of	the	work.	The	vast	majority	of	outcomes	focus on	how	the	shopper	accounts	for	or	copes	with	Clare’s	absence,	and	a	substantial minority	focus	on	how	the	brunette	serves	as	the	reminder,	the	absolver,	or	the supplement	of	that	absence.	Of	the	136	Aisle	commands	resulting	in	distinct outcomes,	59	(or	nearly	half)	refer	to	the	brunette.	Of	the	59	commands	referring to	her,	34	are	speech	acts	(asking,	telling,	and	commanding),	while	the	remaining 25	involving	direct	actions,	many	of	them	socially	inappropriate	(dancing	with her,	taking	her	trolley,	etc.).	Few	outcomes	of	these	direct	actions	are	positive.	In part	this	is	due	to	the	emotional	situation	of	the	shopper,	whose	loneliness provides	an	occasion	for	the	exploration	of	antisocial	behavior,	misogyny,	naked lust,	and	violence.	At	another	level,	Aisle	uses	this	situation	and	configuration	to explore	one	basic	problem	of	IF	�	that	the	availability	of	other	characters	as objects	of	discourse	tends	to	objectify	those	characters,	and	consequently	expose them	to	a	wide	range	of	often-inappropriate	explorative	behaviors. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Most	of	the	interactor’s	visual	and	mental	explorations	(LOOK	 <i class="calibre3">THINK</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">ABOUT	</i> REMEMBER)	lead	back	into	the	shopper’s	past	and	circle	around	the central	trauma	that	is	the	cause	of	Clare’s	absence.	These	can	be	traced,	or	they can	be	guessed	at.	The	interactor	may	attempt	to	inductively	arrive	at	the possibility	of	an	ending,	as	in	these	example	inputs:</p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	REMEMBER	CLARE’S	ACCIDENT</p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	REMEMBER	CLARE’S	ILLNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	REMEMBER	CLARE’S	LEAVING	YOU</p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	REMEMBER	CLARE’S	SUICIDE</p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	REMEMBER	CLARE’S	MURDER</p>
<p class="calibre1">Exploration	can	occur	by	induction	or	deduction.	While	many	interactors	will guess	at	the	possibility	of	murder	preemptively	when	exploring	the	cause	of Clare’s	traumatic	loss,	the	word	“murder”	does	in	fact	appear	as	an	explicit</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p207"></a>prompt	exactly	once	in	the	outcome	of	WOMAN,	LOOK	AT	ME.	During	this resolution	the	shopper	assaults	the	brunette	and	is	subsequently	beaten unconscious	by	a	security	guard,	awakening	to	overhear	a	familiar	psychiatrist discussing	“the	anniversary	of	his	girlfriend’s	murder.”	The	psychiatrist	omitting who	killed	Clare	is	typical	of	Aisle’s	use	of	ambiguity	to	motivate	interactor exploration.	On	the	one	hand,	the	interactor	may	continue	exploring	social interaction	with	the	woman,	perhaps	in	a	more	socially	acceptable	form (WOMAN,	HI).	On	the	other	hand,	the	interactor	might	veer	off	to	investigate this	ambiguous	murder,	which	(having	been	mentioned	in	the	text)	is	now implied	in	the	code,	and	might	be	implemented	and	addressable.	Here,	the	act	of guessing	at	a	back-story	will	make	it	so,	for	in	order	to	explore	whether	the shopper	can	remember	or	speak	of	a	murder,	the	interactor	must	first	presume the	fact	of	the	murder	in	order	to	reference	it.	Even	then,	how	it	is	presumed	still affects	the	response.	If	the	interactor	chooses	for	the	shopper	to	remember,	she	is confronted	by	disturbing	yet	still	ambiguous	imagery:</p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	REMEMBER	CLARE’S	MURDER</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	one	thing	you	didn’t	want	to	remember.	A	bloody	smile	drawn	across	the aisle,	Gnocchi	for	teeth-punch	them	all	out-A	red,	red	smile-brighter	than	any lipstick-but	wait-she	speaks.	No;	she	does	not.	The	smile	drips,	runs	into	the carpet	and	blushes	into	a	crimson	flower.	Purple	bruises.	Colourful	scene	don’t you	think?	Of	course	it’s	all	in	the	past	now.	And	they	said	you	were	over	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	bright	red	smile	opens	and	devours	you	whole.	Everything	goes	black. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	shopper’s	first	reaction	to	this	vision	of	a	pasta-and-sauce	death mask	is	violence	(“punch	them	all	out”),	is	he	violently	rejecting	the	traumatic reminder	of	discovering	his	murdered	lover,	or	is	that	a	crazed	episode	indicating that	he	was	her	killer?	There	are	several	answers	to	this	question	scattered throughout	the	text,	but	the	primary	problem	that	confronts	us	here	is	that	the shopper’s	basic	mode	of	memory	is	usually	imagistic,	allusive	and	ambiguous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	is	a	way	around	this,	however.	The	interactor	can	force	the	shopper	to	be literal	by	directing	him	to	articulate	himself	(however	inappropriately)	to	the unfamiliar	brunette	nearby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	TELL	WOMAN	ABOUT	MURDER</p>
<p class="calibre1">You	scurry	up	to	the	brunette.	“Excuse	me-I	probably	ought	to	tell	you	this, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p208"></a>now	rather	than	later”,	she	looks	confused	and	you	continue,	“but	I	am	a murderer.	All	very	complicated	complicated	stuff-but	basically	I	killed	my girlfriend	(my	lover)	and	well	I	am	over	it	now	so	there	is	no	problem	there	but like	I	said	just	thought	I	would	say.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	that	off	your	chest	you	continue	on	your	shop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	last	the	ambiguity	is	resolved,	and	these	interactions	have	led	to	a particular	view	of	the	shopper,	a	set	of	outcomes	we	might	call	the	murderer cluster.	The	interactor’s	progressive	exploration	is	a	kind	of	suggesting	or imagining,	and	it	leads	the	interactor	into	proposing	actions	which	seem reasonable	by	extension	�	such	as	having	the	shopper	describe	an	otherwise intractably	mysterious	topic	out	loud	�	but	which,	in	the	context	of	the quotidian	supermarket	aisle,	are	sociopathic	behaviors.	What	kind	of	man	would explain	a	murder	to	a	stranger?	Perhaps	a	murderer?	The	projective	gesture	has colored	the	author’s	resolution,	for	the	author	is	not	creating	or	omitting	links, but	anticipating	suggested	inputs,	choosing	which	will	be	accommodated,	and then	crafting	the	responses.	Unlike	hypertext,	omission	in	Aisle	is	barely possible.	Once	a	tipping	point	in	the	implication	of	mysterious	trauma	is reached,	the	interactor	will	supply	questions	about	hypothetical	traumas unbidden.	We	recapitulate	what	the	author	anticipates	we	will	choose	him	to	tell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Choosing	to	tell	the	unfamiliar	brunette	about	Clare’s	accident	or	about Clare’s	illness	are	different	gestures	from	choosing	to	recount	her	murder.	These tellings	not	only	create	different	factual	pasts,	they	likewise	characterize different	protagonists	who	in	turn	elicit	different	social	reactions	and	different resolutions.	In	one	story	we	may	find	the	shopper	to	be	a	protective	partner	at	an accident	scene,	in	another	a	devoted	bedside	mourner.	All	of	these	past	traumas are	possible,	most	are	mutually	exclusive,	and	some	can	be	connected interchangeably	to	the	imagery	that	preoccupies	the	many	disturbed	figures, allowing	us	to	reconstruct	mini-histories	by	assembling	fragments	of	the	past with	fragments	of	the	present. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	both	reflections	and	observations	in	Aisle	generally	result	in descriptions	of	the	past,	actions	in	Aisle	also	affect	the	present	and	the	future. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	of	these	implement	a	traditional	set	of	the	basic	verbs	available	since Adventure	(ATTACK,	CLIMB,	HIT,	THROW)	but	totally	inappropriate	to	a supermarket,	while	other	uncommon	but	appropriate	verbs	(BROWSE,	SHOP, SHOPLIFT)	are	unimplemented.	Even	actions	the	interactor	might	use	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p209"></a>intentionally	cast	a	happy	protagonist	(DANCE,	SING)	are	changed	by	context into	signs	of	the	tension	between	the	individual	and	socialization	 <i class="calibre3">society.	The</i> <i class="calibre3">idea	of	action	as	acting-out	is	part	of	the	way	trauma	in	Aisle	is	explored,	but	it</i> <i class="calibre3">is	also	an	authoring	method	that	anticipates	interactor	expectations.	If	the</i> <i class="calibre3">author	</i> programmer	expects	real	interactors	to	use	basic,	traditional	or	common verbs	whether	or	not	they	are	cued	by	the	text,	how	should	these	anticipated commands	be	accommodated?	Aisle’s	response	is	to	make	what	would	normally be	semantically	sensible	(EAT	GNOCCHI)	but	narratively	senseless	acts	(eating un-cooked	un-purchased	food	from	a	store	shelf)	not	a	violation	of	the	diegesis, but	part	of	its	deepest	sense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	of	the	basic	verbs	that	make	up	Aisle’s	master	list	are	such	prior, traditional,	and	often	contextually	inappropriate	commands.	Aisle	anticipates	an interactor	whose	prior	expectations	must	be	accommodated	by	the	code	as	much as	created	by	it.	The	work	becomes	in	part	a	commentary	on	the	antisocial	nature of	the	traditional	adventurer	role	and	its	mode	of	interaction	through objectification	and	inappropriate	physical	manipulation.	Nowhere	is	this	dialog between	Aisle	and	the	conventions	of	IF	more	clear	than	in	the	response	to	the command	INVENTORY,	a	classic	verb	that	lists	any	objects	the	protagonist possesses.	In	an	attempt	to	head	off	the	unmanageable	combinatorial	explosion that	would	be	introduced	by	giving	the	protagonist	even	a	single	grocery-list	to carry	(which	according	to	the	exhaustive	logic	of	the	text	might	then	be	given, thrown,	broken,	eaten,	etc.),	Aisle	intercepts	any	direct	reference	to	the shopper’s	possessions	(“Sorry,	you	can’t	use	your	possessions	directly”),	yet preserves	the	act	of	literally	taking	inventory	itself	as	a	ritualistic	gesture:</p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;INVENTORY</p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking	everything	from	your	pockets	you	crouch	down	and	line	up	your possessions	on	the	floor:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wallet:	coins,	bank	card,	store	card,	bookclub	card,	photo—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Each	object,	representing	something	else,	is	like	a	word.	The	inventory-sentence	ends	and	begins	with	that	photo.	An	attempt	to	possess	Clare	in	her image,	to	hold	her	and	to	contain	her.	You	rearrange	the	coins	in	a	circle	around the	photo,	a	makeshift	frame.	A	photo	of	Clare.	If	only	you	could	lose	those	first few	words:	Clare.	Then	you	could	hold	Clare,	possess	Clare.	She	would	be yours…</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p210"></a>With	a	furtive	glance	you	scoop	up	your	things	and	return	them	to	your pockets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	photo	burns	a	hole	in	your	pocket,	through	your	heart	and	to	the	centre	of your	universe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	“inventory-sentence”	is	made	up	of	objects	as	words.	It	gives	a	general commentary	on	manipulable	linguistic	reality	(or	what	we	might	call	semiotic simulation)	that	is	also	a	way	of	relating	to	the	world.	To	put	Aisle’s	critique	in context,	many	other	works	of	IF	have	parodied	or	critiqued	the	prototypical protagonist	of	Adventure	as	a	looter	and	a	thug	�	a	violent	kleptomaniac	whose attempts	to	TAKE	everything	not	nailed	down	and	KILL	everything	else	are rewarded	with	high	scores.	One	reversal	of	the	looting-to-score	model	of Adventure	is	Taro	Ogawa’s	Enlightenment:	a	one-room	absurdity	(1998),	whose ironic	need	to	create	a	moment	of	darkness	(discussed	in	Ch.	2)	requires	that	the interactor	break,	lose,	and	otherwise	divest	the	protagonist	of	a	dozen	magically glowing	treasures	in	order	that	the	protagonist	may	escape.	A	more	pointed parody	is	Cody	Sandifer’s	dark	comedy	Zero	Sum	Game:	an	exercise	in	fantastic futility	(1997),	which	begins	when	Charlotte	Candy	Mint	arrives	home: You	stumble	across	the	threshold	of	your	sweet	abode,	a	magic	bag	full	of rare,	mystical,	hard-won	treasures	swinging	from	your	greedy	little	hands.	In other	words…</p>
<p class="calibre1">***You	have	won***</p>
<p class="calibre1">Victory	is	interrupted,	however,	when	Charlotte’s	mother	discovers	her	loot and	requires	that	her	75-point	scoreboard	be	reduced	to	zero. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	daughter	of	mine	is	going	to	bring	a	bag	of	‘rare,	mystical,	hard-won treasures’	into	a	God-fearing	house	such	as	ours.	You	hear	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	nod,	your	eyes	welling	up	with	tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good!”	she	says.	“Now	you	give	these	stolen	magical	whoopdedoos	back	to their	proper	owners	and	make	things	right!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	Enlightenment,	Zero	Sum	Game	is	about	undoing	what	has	been	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike	the	Enlightenment	inventory,	however,	Charlotte’s	score	is	comprised	of points	for	both	objects	(a	diamond	ring	and	a	ruby	sapphire)	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p211"></a>accomplishments,	including	a	fair	amount	of	violence	and	crime	(slaying	a dragon,	cheating	a	merchant,	making	a	troll	cry,	stealing	candy).	Predictably, attempting	to	undo	these	things	leaves	a	fresh	trail	of	chaos	in	their	place.	This violence	gets	its	own	critique	in	Cameron	Wilkin’s	Bliss:	an	interactive harrowing	(1999),	which	presents	a	straight-faced,	classical	fantasy	scenario	of	a captured	hero	on	a	quest	to	slay	a	rampaging	dragon	after	escaping	the	evil wizard	Margoth’s	dungeons	and	orc	guards.	The	ensuing	mayhem	is	periodically punctuated	by	strange	visions	of	contemporary	architecture,	and	in	the	end	the hero	is	revealed	as	an	escaped	mental	patient	whose	bloody	rampage	has	killed	a number	of	innocent	civilians. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	recurrent	critique	of	IF	claims	that	the	figure	of	the	adventurer	is inextricable	from	antisocial	fantasies	of	looting	and	violence.	This	idea	has circulated	in	critiques	of	videogames,	IF,	and	Role	Playing	Games	(RPGs)	since the	1970s,	with	RPGs	drawing	particular	attention.	As	is	often	the	case	with external	critiques,	most	provocative	explorations	of	this	idea	have	subsequently come	from	within	the	authoring	communities	themselves.	Writing	about	his	RPG</p>
<p class="calibre1">Power	Kill	(1999)	in	“Prismatic	Play:	Games	as	Windows	on	the	Real	World,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">author	John	Tynes	describes	enacting	the	critique. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	engagist	metagame	posits	that	Dungeons	&amp;	Dragons	participants	are living	out	their	fantasies	through	real-world	psychotic	episodes	in	which	they practice	robbery	and	home	invasion	against	ethnic	and	economic	minorities	�	a violent	incursion	to	a	black	ghetto	is,	to	the	participants,	just	another	“dungeon crawl”	in	which	orcs	and	their	money	are	soon	parted.	They	are	asked	to reconcile	the	differences	between	their	Dungeons	&amp;	Dragons	character	sheet	of statistics	and	treasures	with	their	Power	Kill	character	sheet,	a	patient	record from	a	mental	ward	for	the	dangerously	insane.	[…]	Power	Kill	is	intended	as	a Swiftian	satire,	an	engagist	attempt	to	take	the	escapism	of	Dungeons	&amp;	Dragons and	explore	its	connections	to	the	real	world	of	human	behavior.	(222) Like	the	metaphor	of	autism	discussed	in	the	previous	chapter,	this	satire hinges	on	the	slide	from	characteristics	of	the	protagonist	to	those	of	interactor due	to	mental	dysfunction.	Where	some	autistic	critiques	posited	that	the	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">interactor	has	a	genetically	determined	aesthetic	aversion	to	reality,	and	thus prefers	IF,	the	Power	Kill	scenario	suggests	schizophrenia	that	turns	a	preference for	escapist	fantasy	into	an	in	inability	to	distinguish	it	from	reality.	A	parody	of this	threat	appears	in	the	lyrics	from	MC	Frontalot’s	2007	rap	song	about interactive	fiction	“It	Is	Pitch	Dark”:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p212"></a>That	don’t	play	in	public	life.	You	get	arrested, psychoactive	medication	daily	in	your	big	intestine and	attesting	that	the	voices	in	your	head</p>

<p class="calibre1">While	Aisle	contains	many	scenes	of	psychotic	violence	in	conjunction	with the	real	world,	what	is	striking	about	the	INVENTORY	scene	and	its	clear reference	to	the	medium	of	IF	is	the	difference	of	its	critique	from	schizophrenic scenarios	in	Bliss,	Power	Kill,	or	“It	Is	Pitch	Dark.”	Rather	than	damning escapism	(which	in	these	works	is	always	represented	in	the	form	of	generic fiction,  <i class="calibre3">i.e. </i>	high	fantasy),	Aisle	instead	repeatedly	suggests	that	there	may	be something	disturbingly	wrong	with	objectification	as	the	fundamental	verb-object	mode	of	relating	to	the	world	inherent	in	IF’s	command	line	interface.	The desire	to	heal	Clare’s	absence	with	some	name-object-possession	(rather	than person)	is	likewise	rebuffed	in	most	ham-fisted	attempts	at	romancing	the unfamiliar	brunette,	as	in	“WOMAN,	COME	TO	ROME	WITH	ME,”	in	which the	shopper	seems	both	unconcerned	about	whether	he	knows	the	woman	he	is addressing	and	incapable	of	differentiating	her	from	other	women:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	can	go	back	to	Rome,	again.	Should	be	even	better	than	last	time!”	She</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p213"></a>steps	back,	blushing,	“I’m	sorry.	I	don’t	know	you.”	She	hurries	round	the	corner of	the	aisle.	You	shout	after	her,	“Course	you	do,	Clare!	Cathy?	Amanda? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sophie?”	You	never	were	one	for	names. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Other	resolutions	situate	“Clare”	as	a	multiple	personality	in	the	mind	of	the shopper.	In	this	scenario	the	shopper	is	a	private	transvestite	whose	public	male personality	“Clark”	sexually	harasses	the	unfamiliar	woman	on	the	way	to buying	“gnocchi	for	two”	�	himself	and	the	female	alter	ego	signified	by	his wearing	women’s	underwear.	Like	many	Aisle	outcomes,	this	resolves	the question	of	Clare.	Still,	it	is	important	to	point	out	that	there	are	some	less traumatic	resolutions,	which	(given	the	overall	tenor	of	the	work)	take	on	special significance	in	their	exceptionality.	While	these	may	outcomes	be	encountered	in any	order	due	to	the	structure	of	the	work,	they	suggest	solutions	to	problems presented	in	many	other	outcomes.	For	example,	interrogating	or	commanding the	woman	often	carries	is	often	marked	(among	other	things)	with	the	basic social	stress	of	attempting	any	kind	of	serious	interaction	without	knowing	a person’s	name.	An	alternative	is	to	simply	to	ASK	THE	WOMAN	ABOUT	HER</p>
<p class="calibre1">NAME:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	I’m	at	a	disadvantage-you	know	my	name,	but	I	don’t	know	yours…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiles,	“I’m	Clare”	(she	doesn’t	say	whether	it’s	with	an	‘i’	or	not,	we’ll	just assume).	In	a	whipcrack	chain	of	rather	bizarre	events,	you	end	up	in	the supermarket	cafe	surrounded	by	a	pile	of	shopping	bags. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aisle	delivers	closure	here	with	a	wink	(“we’ll	just	assume”),	fusing	the	figure of	Clare	with	the	unfamiliar	woman.	If	the	two	are	one	and	the	same,	then	a traumatic	past	has	been	replaced	by	a	pleasant	date,	and	perhaps	a	promising future.	There	are	other	ways	to	find	Clare,	however.	Both	FIND	CLARE	and CALL	CLARE	evoke	a	short	romantic	scene	with	a	Clare	who	is	the	shopper’s present	life-partner.	As	it	transpires,	she	is	just	around	the	corner,	helping	out with	the	household	shop.	What	is	remarkable	about	these	outcomes	is	that	they are	simple,	obvious,	and	logically	continuous	with	the	initial	passage	as	given, and	totally	contrary	to	the	presumption	of	over	95%	of	Aisle	outcomes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although	we	are	warned	at	the	outset	that	“not	all	stories	are	about	the	same man”	we	can	come	to	know	this	transcendental	traumatized	shopper	in	many incarnations,	and	it	takes	real	positive	thinking	to	imagine	him	otherwise.	Just	as presuming	the	murder	confirms	it,	we	must	presume	the	fact	of	Clare	in	the	code in	order	to	refer	to	her,	even	though	(like	the	shopper’s	memories)	she	only exists	offstage	from	the	opening	passage	�	not	a	link,	but	a	blind	leap	of	faith. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p214"></a>If	Aisle	has	an	implied	programmer	/	author,	this	is	its	deeper	and	fairly consistent	morality:	physical	actions	are	easy,	but	social	outcomes	are	hard,	and the	important	thing	is	respect,	honesty,	appropriate	listening,	and	the	power	and responsibility	of	negative	and	positive	thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Never	ending?	Adam	Cadre’s	Shrapnel</p>
<p class="calibre1">Beginning	with	minimal	definitions	of	IF	and	the	limits	of	the	single interaction,	the	move,	and	the	short	traversal,	we’ve	gone	in-depth	into	Aisle,	a work	whose	primary	mode	of	interaction	is	reading	across	the	limits	of	its	one-turn	traversal.	We	might	almost	call	this	mode	a	kind	of	extradiegetic	cheating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	Aisle,	Rematch	is	ostensibly	a	one-move	work,	yet	it	is	crucially	different in	the	way	it	complicates	the	model	of	interacting	outside	the	traversal.	Shrapnel is	neither	minimalist	nor	one-move,	yet	it	provides	the	perfect	transitional example	to	understanding	this	complication.	It	is	an	example	of	unreliable	code, in	particular	the	unreliable	traversal	that	misrepresents	closure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Adam	Cadre’s	Shrapnel	(2000)	is	a	surreal	work	even	by	IF	standards	�	a southern	gothic	themed	horror	story	featuring	elements	of	time-travel.	Shrapnel begins	with	the	status	bar	flashing	six	phrases: You	are	standing	***	You	have	died.	***	west	of	a	white	house	***	You	have died.	***	with	a	boarded	front	door.	***	You	have	died.	***</p>
<p class="calibre1">This	echo	of	the	opening	location	from	Zork,	rendered	uncanny	by	grim interjections,	is	then	restated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">West	of	the	house</p>
<p class="calibre1">You	are	standing	west	of	a	white	house	with	a	boarded	front	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	blink.	Boarded?	You	came	all	this	way	and	the	door	is	boarded? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Is	this	supposed	to	be	some	sort	of	game? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	interjections	are	replaced	by	the	reaction	of	the	nominal	protagonist	Billy Blake	who	has	been	summoned	out	to	his	business	partner	Whitman’s	house only	to	find	it	boarded.	In	the	moment	of	asking	“Is	this	supposed	to	be	some sort	of	game?”	Shrapnel	simultaneously	questions	both	its	ancestor	Zork	and itself.	Zork	was	definitely	supposed	to	be	“some	sort	of	game,”	and	the	boarded</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p215"></a>door	was	the	very	first	of	many	obstacles	placed	in	the	adventurer’s	way	for	the purpose	of	being	overcome.	Both	Shrapnel	and	Zork	begin	with	an	awareness	of the	interactor’s	disorientation	and	uncertainty	as	to	motivation.	Zork	addresses this	through	the	device	of	the	mailbox	flier,	directly	addressing	the	protagonist	as an	adventurer	and	providing	an	ironic	self-aware	moment	to	set	the	appropriately playful	mood.	This	mood	is	continuous	with	the	wry	tone	of	the	parser-narrator throughout	the	game.	Shrapnel	on	the	other	hand,	begins	in	a	different	kind	self-awareness,	alluding	to	the	founding	text	of	the	genre	only	as	a	way	of	indicating an	intention	to	be	something	else	altogether. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	LOOK</p>
<p class="calibre1">West	of	the	house</p>
<p class="calibre1">You	are	standing	in	an	open	field	west	of	a	white	house	with	a	boarded	front door.	Towering	Carolina	pines	loom	all	around	this	clearing,	silhouetted	in	the dusk;	soon	it	will	be	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Differing	from	the	normally	austere	language	of	Zork,	the	expanded description	is	simultaneously	lyrical	and	foreboding.	From	it,	Shrapnel	proceeds immediately	into	horror.	When	the	interactor	attempts	to	bypass	the	boards	by moving	around	the	house	in	either	direction	(as	was	the	solution	in	the	clearly referenced	ancestor	text),	the	protagonist	is	suddenly	set	upon	and	killed	by	a pack	of	dogs.	“***	You	have	died.	***”	again	appears	on	the	screen,	this	time accompanied	as	part	of	what	appears	to	be	a	standard	parser-generated	offer	to RESTART,	RESTORE	a	saved	game,	or	QUIT?”	commonly	displayed	after	any IF	ends.	While	many	readers	may	choose	to	restart,	attempting	anything	else reveals	that,	no	matter	what	is	typed,	RESTART	is	spelled	out	on	the	screen,	one letter	appearing	for	each	key	pressed	by	the	interactor.	Not	only	was	the	death sudden	and	unfair,	but	also	any	option	other	than	force-terminating	the	program is	a	false	choice.	Inevitably,	the	reader	is	back	among	the	Carolina	pines,	but with	a	difference. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three	snarling	attack	dogs	fight	with	one	another	over	the	remains	of	your corpse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	moment	presents	two	apparent	impossibilities.	In	the	narrative,	the discourse	of	realism	suggested	by	the	“Carolina	pines”	is	disrupted	by	a confrontation	with	the	protagonist’s	corpse.	Outside	the	narrative,	what	has</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p216"></a>occurred	is	a	violation	of	the	norms	of	IF	simulation.	The	RESTART	command should	wipe	the	memory	of	the	runtime	environment	and	return	the	IF	text	to	its initial	state.	How	is	the	presence	of	the	corpse	possible?	The	moment	calls attention	to	the	fact	that	the	RESTART	command	is	itself	a	convention	that	may be	deliberately	broken.	The	parser	has	not	reset	the	game	but	has	instead	played with	the	interactor’s	literacy,	in	this	case	a	set	of	assumptions	about	how	code may	structure	the	narrative.	While	the	RESTART	command	is	present	in	almost all	contemporary	IF	by	default	and	by	convention,	this	initial	condition	(like any)	can	be	reconfigured	or	hacked.	The	corpse	reveals	that	what	appeared	to	be two	traversals	of	the	work	were	in	fact	continuous;	a	difference	between	code and	implied	code	has	been	opened	and	then	quickly	closed	again. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Shrapnel	is	not	the	first	or	the	last	work	to	play	with	the	idea	of	a	game stretching	across	traversals.	Priscilla	Langridge’s	Bugsy	(1986)	is	a	comedic gangster-themed	work	of	IF	that	begins	with	the	protagonist	(a	cartoon	rabbit) already	mortally	wounded.	A	confidant	suggests	“a	sucker	to	advise	you	from	a computer	keyboard”	and	promises,	“It’s	no	hardship	to	die	in	an	adventure	game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	just	get	a	message	saying:	END	OF	GAME:	Do	you	want	to	try	again?”	The statement	has	become	a	prompt,	and	at	this	point	the	interactor	can	supply	her first	input:	YES.	By	comparison,	Peter	Seebach	and	Kevin	Lynn’s	Janitor (2002),	also	begins	at	the	ending,	with	an	animation	of	the	typed	input	Q	U	I	T</p>
<p class="calibre1">appearing	on	screen	as	soon	as	the	game	begins.	Janitor	is	a	metafictional	IF</p>
<p class="calibre1">work	in	which	a	janitor	must	restore	the	set	of	a	traditional	IF	adventure	quest after	it	has	been	completed,	much	as	if	he	were	cleaning	an	amusement	park. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barriers	must	be	fixed;	looted	treasures	must	be	returned	to	their	places,	and	so forth.	While	the	work	begins	with	quitting	time,	the	janitor	is	an	after-hours persona	who	enacts	the	process	of	restarting	from	the	point	of	view	of	the simulation	rather	than	the	typical	interactor.	This	behind-the-scenes representation	of	IF	is	also	taken	in	J.	D.	Berry’s	When	Help	Collides	(2002),	a comedy	whose	actor	is	the	personification	of	an	interactive	fiction	help	or	hint system	who	must	advise	players	on	their	games	in	progress.	By	comparison, Jonathan	Fry’s	A	New	Day	(1997)	uses	“an	unfinished	work	of	IF”	as	the	setting for	a	mystery	involving	the	death	of	the	work’s	author.	All	of	these	works	begin with	the	conceit	that,	like	actors	in	a	play,	the	constituent	actors	of	IF	are	part	of some	larger	world.	The	great	precedent	for	this	in	IF	is	the	Adventure	Repository</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p217"></a>locale	in	Adventure.	Other	meta-IF	works	reframe	interactivity	as	play-testing, including	Neil	deMause’s	Undo	(1995),	Wesley	Osam’s	Cheater	(1996),	and Anssi	Raisanen’s	Bugged	(2001).	Some	even	feature	the	direct	manipulation	of programming,	such	as	William	J.	Shlaer’s	Informatory	(1998)	and	Inform	School (1999). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	our	survey	of	tense	at	the	command	line	and	how	it	tends	to	reveal	or conceal	the	separate	self	of	the	interactor,	we	have	seen	two	consistent	strategies by	IF	artists	for	breaking	the	fourth	wall:	either	humor,	or	the	attempt	to incorporate	an	extra	frame	or	level	into	the	diegesis	that	will	contain	the violation	(or	both).	The	same	is	true	in	these	examples,	where	self-conscious humor	is	the	usual	response	to	what	we	might	call	breaking	the	first	wall.	The first	wall	is	the	back	curtain,	behind	which	crouches	the	mechanism	of	the parser.	While	this	man-behind-the-curtain	may	usually	be	addressed	directly about	the	most	basic	mechanics	of	the	simulation	(ABOUT,	CREDITS,	HELP, RESTART,	RESTORE,	SAVE,	UNDO,	QUIT,	etc.),	drawing	further	attention	to him	is	generally	an	invitation	to	comedy.	Indeed,	some	games	disable	meta-commands	altogether,	either	to	defend	choices	from	being	rendered	trivial	at crucial	junctures	of	the	work	(you	can’t	UNDO,	you	have	to	go	back	and	replay) or	to	avoid	disrupting	the	work’s	tone.	Jon	Ingold’s	Fail-Safe,	for	example, preserves	the	illusion	of	command	line	radio	transmission	almost	entirely.	It prints	bursts	of	static	in	response	to	all	traditional	meta-commands	save	one, QUIT,	which	renders	a	perfectly	diegetic	effect	before	ending	the	session:	“-</p>
<p class="calibre1">Click-“. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ingold’s	approach	represents	one	serious	method	of	treating	the	meta-commands	�	ignoring	them	�	but	others	have	woven	them	into	their	diegeses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	Ravipinto	and	Star	Foster’s	Slouching	Towards	Bedlam	(2003)	in particular	makes	the	acts	of	saving,	restoring,	and	restarting	part	of	the	core fabric	of	the	work.	The	gothic	steampunk	IF	focuses	on	the	investigation	of Bethlehem	Hospital	administrator	Dr.	Thomas	Xavier	into	the	mysterious	case	of an	incarcerated	lunatic	named	Cleve	who	is	pathologically	averse	to	speaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	it	transpires,	the	lunatic	is	a	Gnostic	cryptographer.	While	attempting	to commune	technologically	with	the	divine,	he	becomes	infected	with	a consciousness-consuming	mental	virus	called	the	Logos	that	spreads	between humans	via	glossolalic	speech.	One	of	the	interesting	side-effects	of	the	Logos infection	is	the	way	it	allows	humans	to	subvert	linear	time	in	a	fashion	much like	IF,	as	Xavier	discovers	in	a	written	psychiatric	interview	with	Cleve:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p218"></a>The	patient	has	�	in	his	mind	�	somehow	come	unstuck	in	time.	He	speaks of	it	as	if	it	were	a	malleable	thing.	He	mentioned	several	times	in	his	notes	to me	that	he	could	‘save’	moments,	as	if	in	a	delaying	glass.	He	kept	several	of them	with	him,	and	‘restored’	them	as	he	wished,	reliving	the	past/present/future. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	asked	about	the	‘different’	me	he	replied	that	he’d	tried	restoring several	times,	changing	them	�	seeing	different	paths	that	resulted.	This,	he said,	was	the	best	he	could	find. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	asked	him	if	he	had	saved	a	moment	from	before	this	all	happened,	before his	‘infection’.	Back	when	he	was	simply	Cleve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	said	he’d	‘restarted’	from	time	to	time,	but	that	it	only	took	him	as	far	back as	his	‘new	creation’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Interestingly,	the	Logos	infection	is	both	a	mode	of	consciousness	(the	ability to	experience	sequences	of	nonlinear	time)	and	a	consciousness	(a	separate	self) that	comments	on	Xavier	and	the	interactor’s	situations	and	acts	of	its	own accord. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	dim	light	glinting	off	the	small	badge	he	wears	�	James	�	Assistant	�</p>
<p class="calibre1">/(livinggrowthfrictionfurtherspreadingoutwardstretchingyestouchingyes)\</p>

<p class="calibre1">“All	right	then,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	he	is	nodding	and	returning	to	his	seat,	somehow	both	more	and	less nervous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">/(yesdoneyes)\</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	first	strangely	runtogethersentence	indicates	that	the	Logos	has	spoken through	Xavier’s	mouth	(although	the	interactor	may	not	yet	understand	this). </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	speech	in	turn	infects	his	assistant	James,	as	it	infects	every	character	that Xavier	meets	for	the	first	time.	People	react	with	mildly	dazed	confusion	upon becoming	infected,	and	their	symptoms	of	preoccupied	disorientation	provide	a further	diegetic	justification	for	the	limits	of	their	simulated	abilities	as interlocutors	(although	only	a	partial	justification,	due	to	its	slow	onset).	As	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p219"></a>Logos	can	comment	and	act,	it	can	also	be	directly	addressed,	taking	on	some	of the	duties	of	the	parser:</p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;RESTART</p>
<p class="calibre1">/(??	RESTARTperiodfirstrevisit	??)\</p>
<p class="calibre1">Strangely,	however,	many	of	the	design	conceits	of	Slouching	Towards Bedlam	are	not	taken	to	their	logical	conclusion.	Basic	error	messages	for parsing	and	disambiguation	are	not	explained	as	Logos-related	seizures	or interruptions,	and	a	host	of	common	meta-verbs	are	left	exposed	(ABOUT, CREDITS,	HELP,	etc.). </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;TALK	TO	JAMES</p>
<p class="calibre1">[Conversation	is	best	done	by	ASK	&lt;PERSON&gt;	ABOUT	&lt;SUBJECT&gt;	or TELL	&lt;PERSON&gt;	ABOUT	&lt;SUBJECT&gt;.	People	can	be	ordered	to	do	things	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">&lt;PERSON&gt;,	&lt;ORDER&gt;.]</p>
<p class="calibre1">James	licks	his	lips	nervously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;CONFUSE	PARSER</p>
<p class="calibre1">That	is	not	a	recognized	verb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although	it	is	an	excellent	conceit	for	doing	so,	in	other	words,	the	Logos	has not	been	used	to	bring	the	majority	of	the	parser	into	the	diegesis.	Instead,	it treats	one	small	aspect	of	the	parser	thematically	�	traversal	management	such as	RESTART.	This	is	done	through	introducing	yet	another	actor,	a	bifurcation of	Xavier’s	personality	with	plausible	access	not	just	to	traversal-time,	but	to session-time.	The	Logos	weirdly	is-and-is-not	the	parser,	constantly	forgetting on	restart	what	it	yet	asserts	that	the	transcendental	Xavier-interactor	remembers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Cleve	describes	in	his	journal:	“I	understand	all.	I	(if	I	can	still	lay	claim	to	I) have	moved	through	time,	backwards	and	forwards…I	have	tried	every	way imaginable	to	make	it	not	so.	Once…once	I	tried	to	make	it	finally	so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	Aisle,	extradiegetic	“cheating”	is	the	encouraged	mode	of	reading.	Aisle thematizes	the	process	of	beginning	again,	reducing	the	length	of	the	traversal until	almost	all	interactor	knowledge	comes	from	other	traversals.	In	Slouching Towards	Bedlam,	by	contrast,	no	information	from	other	traversals	can	be	truly</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p220"></a>extradiegetic.	All	restarting	and	restoring,	all	outcomes	and	all	explored alternatives	are	anticipated	and	explained	as	part	of	the	experience	of	the infected	Dr.	Xavier,	whose	aggregated	experiments	playing	with	the	possibilities of	his	fate	become	trivially	distinct	from	the	experiments	of	the	interactor	with the	text. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shrapnel	takes	a	third	path,	blurring	the	line	between	continuity	and discontinuity	by	staging	the	“beginning	again”	of	a	RESTART	and	carefully managing	the	result	as	part	of	a	single	simulation	traversal.	Each	of	the	five brutal	death	scenes	and	coerced	RESTARTs	in	the	work	is	a	fake,	and	the	bodies pile	up	as	a	grim	reminder	of	the	interactor	attempting	to	exhaust	the	fatal	logic of	the	geography.	Unlike	Slouching	Towards	Bedlam,	Shrapnel	controls	the progression	of	various	scenarios	and	uses	spatial	representation	to	stage	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Time	here	is	an	unstable	quality	of	space,	and	thus	time	can	be	navigated	by wandering	the	grounds	and	rooms	of	Whitman’s	house.	This	creates	odd	effects, such	as	a	door	being	boarded	from	outside	the	house	(the	future)	but	open	and unboarded	from	inside	the	house	(the	past),	and	these	confusions	are	exacerbated by	the	temporal	status	of	each	location	shifting	several	times	as	the	exploration progresses.	Complicating	this	representation	even	further	is	the	odd	condition	of the	unreliable	protagonist.	“Billy	Blake”	is	actually	an	alter	ego	and	split personality	of	William	Whitman.	The	constant	uncanny	moments	in	Shrapnel mark	Blake’s	ambivalence,	both	recognizing	and	resisting	the	knowledge	that the	figure	and	the	family	of	Whitman	are	in	fact	his	own.	Upon	first	beginning the	work,	the	disoriented	interactor	necessarily	emulates	the	willfully	ignorant part	of	Blake	/	Whitman’s	multiple	personality	disorder.	Much	like	Shade,	the logic	of	most	of	the	work	(up	to	the	coda)	is	to	resolve	this	ignorance,	forcing the	acknowledgment	of	what	Whitman	already	knows	to	be	the	truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	truth	of	William	Whitman’s	past	is	a	terrible	place	to	explore.	Whitman	is wounded	by	shrapnel	during	the	Civil	War	and	adopts	the	persona	of	dead comrade	Blake	to	cope	with	the	pain,	but	this	persona	(racist,	sexist,	hateful	and bullying)	spirals	into	terrible	domestic	violence:	harassing	his	daughter	Ann, abusing	and	embezzling	from	his	son	Junior,	brain	damaging	and	then	locking away	his	son	Gregory,	instigating	his	son	Johnny’s	suicide	by	forcing	him	into the	role	of	Gregory’s	care-taker,	and	finally	raping	his	daughter	Betty.	After Betty’s	suicide,	Whitman’s	surviving	children	come	together	and	murder	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blake	/	Whitman’s	multiple	personality	disorder	does	explain	the	interactor’s disorientation.	It	does	not	explain	his	status	as	murdered	man	reflecting	on	his own	death(s),	nor	the	special	state	of	the	world	he	encounters	in	Shrapnel	�	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p221"></a>traumatic	dreamwork	typified	by	both	condensation	and	repression.	Like	Aisle, whose	quotidian	space	becomes	the	occasion	for	many	excursions	into repression-breaching	associations	and	recollections,	Shrapnel	provides	an occasion	to	excavate	and	reconstruct	history.	Unlike	the	supermarket	aisle	and shopper,	whose	possibilities	multiply	without	diegetic	explanation,	the	white house	in	the	Carolina	pines	has	become	an	occasion	for	historical	excavation	for a	reason	that	the	work	clearly	defines.	This	rationale	is	a	time-travel	device	that detonated	into	shrapnel	during	a	Civil	War	bombardment,	fragmenting	the	future events	and	possibilities	of	Whitman’s	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	39.	Scenes	from	Cadre’s	Shrapnel.	Above:	An	opening	interaction, with	the	parser	reinterpreting	any	input	as	r	e	s	t	a	r	t.	Below:	The	closing sequence	descends	into	chaos	just	before	the	screen	goes	blank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although	we	witness	a	glimpse	of	the	temporal	accident	midway	through	the work,	Shrapnel’s	rationale	arrives	mainly	as	an	explanatory	coda	(to	paraphrase: a	time-traveler	came	back	to	prevent	Whitman’s	wound,	but	his	time	machine was	wounded	by	shrapnel	instead,	destroying	Whitman’s	temporality).	This	coda is	optional,	and	in	either	case	the	true	end	comes	when	the	parsed	description text	collapses	into	a	jumble,	dissolves	into	a	mass	of	nonsense	letters,	and	then suddenly	terminates.	Explaining	definitively	that	this	signifies	the technologically	induced	dissolution	of	time	may	be	an	unnecessary	elaboration, like	many	final	explanations	of	many	central	conceits	in	fiction.	Still,	I’d	like	to use	this	rationale	�	the	experience	of	time	damaged	by	the	conjunction	of	war and	technology	�	as	the	occasion	to	suggest	a	context	for	Shrapnel.	The	context is	a	group	of	works	at	the	intersection	of	the	time-loop	and	the	traumatic dreamwork,	particularly	works	of	literature	and	film.	This	brief	bibliography	of temporal	trauma	begins	with	Ambrose	Bierce’s	1890	short	story	An	Occurrence at	Owl	Creek	Bridge,	in	which	Confederate	sympathizer	Peyton	Farquhar	is	set up	and	then	executed	for	sabotage,	but	dreams	a	fantastic	escape	in	the	moment before	the	rope	breaks	his	neck.	While	the	noose	is	perhaps	not	a	standout example	of	technologically	mediated	trauma,	it	is	the	operation	of	the	noose	(the physical-temporal	distance	the	rope	creates	between	the	act	of	execution	and	the fact	of	death)	that	creates	the	pocket	of	time	in	which	Peyton’s	hopes	and	dreams exist.	By	contrast,	Dalton	Trumbo’s	1938	novel	Johnny	Got	His	Gun accommodates	the	reflective	dreamwork	within	the	life	support	systems	that preserve	a	deaf,	blind,	mute,	and	quadriplegic	World	War	I	veteran	after	he	is maimed	by	shelling.	In	Kurt	Vonnegut’s	1969	novel	Slaughterhouse	Five,	World War	II	veteran	Billy	Pilgrim	ascribes	his	experience	of	being	“unstuck	in	time” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p222"></a>to	being	kidnapped	and	incarcerated	by	the	4-dimensional	alien	Tralfamadorians, although	his	incarceration	in	the	titular	slaughterhouse	during	the	firebombing	of Dresden	seems	a	more	likely	cause.	Like	the	interrogation	chair	in	the	1985</p>
<p class="calibre1">Terry	Gilliam	film	Brazil,	external,	unnatural	technology	creates	the	occasion	for the	occupant’s	special	state	of	mind	�	an	escape	into	fantasy	that	can	never fully	repress	the	terrible	reality	of	the	situation.	Gilliam’s	1988	film	The Adventures	of	Baron	Munchhausen	provides	a	more	specific	example	of	this traumatic	techno-dreamwork’s	specific	conjunction	with	war.	In	it,	a	Turkish army	bombards	an	unidentified	European	city	during	“The	Age	of	Reason.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bombardment	of	the	city	theatre	creates	the	conjunction	of	elaborate	theatrical set	technology	and	disruptive	violence	necessary	to	produce	the	film’s immersive	dreamscape,	a	state	in	which	the	Baron’s	audience	believes	his description	of	“the	many	occasions	on	which	I	met	my	death.”	The	1990	Adrian Lyne	film	Jacob’s	Ladder	also	concerns	the	dreamwork	of	a	bayoneted	U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">soldier	of	the	Vietnam	War,	Jacob	Singer,	whose	understanding	and	eventual acceptance	of	his	life	and	death	is	prevented	and	enabled	by	“The	Ladder,”	both a	metaphor	and	an	experimental	military	hallucinogen	secretly	administered	to his	troop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	are	endless	other	narrative	associations	of	the	dreamwork	with technology,	from	the	explorations	of	the	traumatized	mind	in	films	like Alejandro	Amen�bar’s	Abre	los	ojos	(1997)	or	Mark	Protosevich	and	Tarsem Singh’s	The	Cell	(2000)	to	the	virtual	reality	fictions	of	Vernor	Vinge,	William Gibson,	Neal	Stephenson,	and	so	forth.	For	coherence,	however,	I	am	focusing on	military	techno-trauma,	especially	bombardments,	and	the	purpose	of	this focus	is	to	provoke	general	reflection	on	where	the	technical	representation	of disjointed	or	condensed	time	usually	appears	in	fiction	and	to	what	ends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although	Shrapnel	is	such	a	traumatic	representation	born	out	of	the	Civil	War, it	differs	from	the	works	of	Bierce,	Trumbo,	Vonnegut,	Gilliam,	and	Lyne	in	that the	work	seems	particular	to	Whitman	and	his	exceptional	southern-gothic	life, rather	than	an	indictment	of	the	Civil	War	in	general.	His	shrapnel	wound	does not	ultimately	comment	on	national	policies	nor	reflect	shameful	histories	(such as	the	state	of	veteran’s	hospitals,	the	fact	of	the	Dresden	firebombing,	or	the controversy	over	the	use	of	3-quinuclidinyl	benzilate	on	Vietnam	soldiers). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rather	than	a	red	badge	of	courage,	Whitman’s	wound	and	his	method	of	coping with	it	are	personal	and	domestic	tragedies	�	or	horrors.	The	subsequent escalation	of	his	wounding	into	a	temporal	crisis	is	not	a	national	narrative,	but	a senseless	accident	�	a	kind	of	crash	that	cannot	be	averted,	only	understood. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p223"></a>Always	rushing,	always	late:	Andrew	Pontious’s	Rematch Andrew	Pontious’s	Rematch:	an	interactive	repetition	(2000)	is	an	IF	work whose	goal	is	to	avert	a	personal,	senseless	accident.	Rematch	begins	in	a cavernous	pool	hall,	where	pool	hall	patrons	and	friends	Kurt,	Ines,	and	Nick’s playful	tension	over	a	game	of	pool	lasts	exactly	one	turn…	before	being suddenly	interrupted	by	a	black	SUV	crashing	through	the	window.	All	three friends	are	instantly	killed,	but	after	his	death	Kurt	finds	himself	constantly restarting,	trapped	in	a	cycle	of	recombinant	moments	each	of	which	leads	up	to the	fatal	accident.	Struggling	to	find	an	outcome	to	the	scenario	that	will	save	the lives	of	both	his	friends,	Kurt	discovers	that	both	the	social	mores	that	govern his	friendships	and	the	social	ecology	of	the	pool	hall	form	two	halves	of	a single	Rube-Goldberg-esque	message	machine.	Kurt	must	construct	the	first	half of	this	machine	through	social	engineering,	whispering	a	message	into	Nick’s	ear to	begin	a	complex	process	that	culminates	in	a	falling	ceiling	fan	that	scatters the	crowd	and	averts	disaster.	As	the	interactor	guides	Kurt	through	the	process of	discovering	an	escape,	she	simultaneously	explores	Kurt’s	frustration	over	his relationships	with	Nick	and	with	Ines.	Rematch’s	true	resolution	is simultaneously	instrumental,	as	everyone	lives,	and	philosophical,	as	Kurt discovers	how	to	understand	and	accept	the	hidden	codes	that	underlie	his friendships. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	of	my	analyses	of	individual	IF	works	thus	far	have	focused	on	progress through	a	work	(coming	into	understanding)	rather	than	the	rupture	of	progress and	failure	of	understanding	that	is	the	first	experience	of	many	puzzles	in	IF’s puzzle	tradition.

<p class="calibre1">But	Nick	has	beaten	you	once	tonight	already,	and	Ines	is	watching	him	more closely	than	you	would	like.	So	you	challenge	him	to	a	rematch.	“Sure,	Kurt!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nick	laughs.	“You	break.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	description	of	the	pool	hall	follows,	and	the	interactor	is	given	a	single opportunity	to	interact	�	perhaps	attempting	to	play	pool,	make	conversation,	or simply	wander	around.	As	in	Aisle,	the	surrounding	environment	is	rich	with	a wide	variety	of	interactive	possibilities.	What	happens	next,	however,	is	certain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	delicate	social	dance	is	interrupted	by	sudden,	gruesome	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	glass	from	the	front	windows	disintegrates	and	sprays	like	water	in	all directions	as	a	black	SUV	explodes	into	the	pool	hall.	Its	wheels	locked,	it fishtails	across	the	smooth	floor	tiles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nick,	the	closest	to	the	window,	disappears	under	the	vehicle’s	wheels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	you	can	move,	the	SUV	hits	your	pool	table	head-on,	crushing	Ines into	the	tabletop	with	a	wet	thump. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	pool	balls	swarm	toward	your	face�</p>
<p class="calibre1">-	You	have	lost	-</p>
<p class="calibre1">This	crash	is	a	violation	on	several	levels.	First,	the	SUV	literally	violates	the space	of	the	pool	hall	and	then	the	bodies	of	the	crash	victims.	Second,	the	crash violates	the	interactor’s	initial	expectations	as	a	reader	about	the	genre	of	the work,	transforming	an	intimate	character	drama	into	the	bloody	spectacle	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">“wet	thump”	without	warning.	Third,	the	crash	violates	the	interactor’s expectations	as	a	player	of	games	and	puzzles.	The	sudden	termination	of	the simulation	in	loss	seems	arbitrary	and	capricious.	The	approach	of	the	car	was not	signaled,	and	if	the	work	was	in	fact	a	game	that	the	interactor	failed	to	play, it	is	not	immediately	apparent	how	a	better	outcome	might	have	been	chosen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such	a	forced-outcome	might	be	understood	as	part	of	an	interactive	prelude	to	a larger	work,	were	it	not	for	the	fact	that	the	parser	makes	clear	that	the	work	has ended:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p225"></a>You	may	restore	a	saved	game,	start	over,	quit,	undo	the	current	command,	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">“auto-undo”	to	undo	both	this	command	and	always	undo	at	the	end	of	a	turn (type	ABOUT	at	any	prompt	for	more	information). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Please	enter	RESTORE,	RESTART,	QUIT,	UNDO,	or	AUTO:	&gt; By	now	we	have	seen	the	moment	of	the	IF	traversal	ending	staged	in	a	wide variety	of	ways.	Unlike	previous	works	that	open	with	a	dramatized	death	that	is in	fact	part	of	a	sequence	(e.g.	Bugsy,	Shrapnel),	Rematch	presents	a	fatal accident	that	appears	to	be	the	actual	ending	of	the	traversal.	Unlike	Slouching Towards	Bedlam,	which	dramatizes	the	act	of	restarting	as	discourse	within	the pan-temporal	consciousness	of	Xavier	and	The	Logos,	in	Rematch	the	parser directly	addresses	the	interactor	rather	than	Kurt	(“Please	enter”)	with	a	set	of actually	afforded	meta-commands.	Only	the	“auto-undo”	option	is	unfamiliar, and	its	introduction	is	our	first	indication	of	what	kind	of	work	Rematch	is, although	it	may	take	several	more	turns	before	this	sinks	in.	As	death	arrives	at the	pool	table	repeatedly	and	relentlessly	over	the	following	several	moves,	the purpose	of	AUTO	becomes	clear.	It	is	a	commitment	to	undo	each	time	without fuss	or	comment,	streamlining	the	process	of	acknowledging	each	new	mistake and	every	nearly-inevitable	defeat.	Put	another	way,	the	AUTO	command (issued	only	once)	appears	to	invest	the	UNDO	command	with	autonomous, automatic	procedural	force,	like	an	automaton…	or	an	automobile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	larger	convention	violated	by	the	black	SUV	both	before	and	after	being invested	with	automatic	power	is	the	convention	against	game	designs	which require	“learning-by-death.”	This	common	misnomer	for	learning-by-restart indicates	that	an	interactor	has	been	forced	to	proceed	by	trial-and-error, restarting	the	simulation	over	and	over	again	in	order	to	discover	correct outcomes	rather	than	arriving	at	those	outcomes	through	successful	implications. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	interactor	of	Rematch,	who	has	always	already	“lost,”	is	initiated	from	the outset	into	a	world	that	is	deeply	unfair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	measure	of	this	unfairness	is	epitextual.	A	page	header	or	banner	reading</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Beaten	once/1”	appears	before	the	first	interaction	turn	even	begins,	referencing the	game	of	pool	which	Kurt	has	just	lost	to	Nick.	If	the	interactor	chooses	to UNDO	after	the	fatal	crash,	the	pre-accident	situation	is	restored,	but	the	banner now	reads	“Beaten	twice/2.”	‘Beaten’	is	now	a	reference	not	only	to	pool	but also	to	the	scenario	of	Rematch	itself,	which	has	bested	the	interactor	through Kurt’s	violent	death.	Subsequent	death	messages	are	signaled	with	the	less</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p226"></a>confrontational	and	more	poetic	“You	have	not	broken	the	cycle.”	“The	cycle”	is the	process	whereby	Rematch	is	read	�	an	oppressive	state	of	constant	death and	failure	which,	no	matter	how	often	the	interactor	undoes,	always	repeats, helpfully	iterating	the	number	of	times	‘beaten’	to	indicate	how	often	Kurt	and the	interactor	have	allowed	yet	another	horrific	accident	to	occur.	Like	the corpse	that	greets	Shrapnel’s	restart,	this	counter	is	evidence	of	past	failure,	and as	it	grows	it	quickly	becomes	overwhelming.	The	problem	at	the	heart	of Rematch	is	a	difficult	one,	and	failures	may	mount	into	hundreds	of	accidents before	it	is	resolved.	With	between	one	and	three	deaths	per	accident,	the	sheer weight	of	being	beaten	comes	to	stand	for	a	crushing	�	or	numbing	�	body count.	Rematch	is	keeping	score,	and	this	is	our	first	indication	that	the	code	is not	in	fact	reverting	to	the	previous	state	when	it	acts	to	UNDO.	The	interactor has	undone,	but	the	system	carries	on,	tallying	Kurt’s	mounting	losses	in	the cycle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rematch	is	ostensibly	a	one-move	work,	and	its	publication	in	2000	after	the striking	novelty	of	Sam	Barlow’s	one-move	Aisle	in	1999	was	widely	hailed	as	a further	innovation	in	a	similar	vein,	prompting	Duncan	Stevens	to	declare	in	his SPAG	#28	review	of	Rematch	that	“we	have	a	new	genre	on	our	hands.”	This sub-genre	is	defined	by	technique	(one-move	structure)	rather	than	by	tropes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rematch	is	not	a	one-move	work,	however.	Like	Shrapnel,	Rematch	blurs	the line	where	the	traversal	ends,	disguising	continuity	as	discontinuity.	In	Rematch this	blurring	depends	on	the	interactor’s	initial	misunderstanding	of	the	effects	of system	meta-commands	(RESTART,	UNDO)	in	order	to	create	a	particular impression	(although	Shrapnel	dramatizes	this,	while	Rematch	downplays	it). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whereas	Aisle	ends	after	a	single	turn,	Rematch	refuses	to	end;	it	is	rather	an infinite	text,	a	hidden	cyclical	process	that	must	be	discerned	in	order	for	the story	to	be	escaped.	Aisle	and	Rematch	might	in	fact	be	members	of	a	nascent genre,	but	if	so	their	commonality	is	their	topical	(rather	than	technical) engagement	with	the	problem	of	the	moment	in	time	through	representations	of the	time-loop	�	not	the	same	sub-genre,	but	the	same	generic	trope.	Like	the uncertain	identity	of	the	nameless	man	in	Aisle,	and	like	the	unstable	persona	of Blake	in	Shrapnel,	Kurt’s	experiences	in	Rematch	are	a	crisis	of	socialization, and	the	disruption	of	linear	time	marks	both	his	profound	investment	in	and profound	alienation	from	the	people	around	him.	While	thematically	parallel, there	are	huge	distinctions	between	how	the	supposedly	similar	Aisle	and Rematch	function	technically	and	unfold	experientially.	In	the	code	behind	the command	line,	Rematch	is	actually	more	like	a	Shrapnel-in-Aisle’s-clothing, constituted	not	by	the	abortive	parallel	engagements	of	the	pasta	aisle,	but	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p227"></a>ongoing	serial	nature	of	the	cycle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	40.	The	falling	flaps	of	the	mechanical-numeric	clock-radio	come	to symbolize	the	identical	initial	conditions	of	each	day	in	Groundhog	Day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oddly,	“the	cycle”	does	not	at	first	appear	to	be	truly	cyclical.	As	the	moment of	the	accident	replays	and	the	count	rises,	events	repeat,	but	never	perfectly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead,	random	and	seemingly	meaningless	variations	are	everywhere	�	in	the background	music	and	the	fragments	of	conversation,	in	the	colors	of	jackets	and the	logos	on	hats,	in	the	arrangement	of	surrounding	tables.	At	times	almost everything	seems	to	vary	except	the	fatal	conjunction	of	Kurt’s	table	and	the oncoming	car.	What	is	the	nature	of	the	cyclical	time	is	depicted	in	Rematch?	It is	interesting	to	compare	and	contrast	time	in	Rematch	with	depictions	of cyclical	time	in	two	films:	Groundhog	Day	(1993)	and	Lola	rennt	(1998).	In	the 1993	Danny	Rubin	and	Harold	Ramis	film	Groundhog	Day,	cantankerous	and misanthropic	weatherman	Phil	Connors	(Bill	Murray)	finds	himself	trapped inside	a	fixed	twenty-four	hour	temporal	loop	within	the	snow-locked	town	of Punxsutawney,	Pennsylvania.	Regardless	of	what	happens,	Phil	always	regains consciousness	a	moment	before	6:00	am	on	the	same	day,	in	the	same	hotel room,	listening	to	the	same	repetitive	song	on	a	mechanical-numeric	clock	radio. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	the	mechanism	of	falling	plastic	flaps	that	wakes	him	each	morning,	the automatic	and	perfect	sameness	of	each	repetitive	day	presents	Phil	with	a Victorian	clockwork	universe.	Left	to	his	own	existential	devices,	he	masters various	causal	mechanisms	of	the	world	around	him	and	optimizes	for	various kinds	of	success,	but	eventually	bores	of	mastery.	Mastery	of	outcomes	is generally	easy	in	the	deterministic	time-loop	of	Groundhog	Day,	whose	causality is	troubled	by	neither	chaos	theory	nor	the	butterfly	effect.	As	all	actions	are limited	to	clearly	defined	reactions,	Phil’s	most	bizarre	interventions	in	the morning	create	few	noteworthy	surprises	for	him	in	the	evening.	This determinism	is	part	of	Punxsutawney’s	crushing	tedium.	Floundering	for purpose,	Phil	eventually	experiments	(among	other	things)	with	a	series	of efficient,	dramatic,	and	totally	ineffective	suicides.	After	setting	out	to	win	the affections	of	his	coworker	Rita	within	his	allotted	twenty-four	hours,	and	failing (some	lines	he	finds	cannot	be	crossed,	and	some	social	interactions	cannot merely	be	mastered),	Phil	next	turns	to	a	long	project	of	self-improvement	and good	works	that	develops	eventually	into	a	confrontation	with	his	own	nature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Citing	Groundhog	Day	is	quite	common	in	interactive	media	and	games circles,	but	uses	of	the	work	are	surprisingly	varied.	In	Hamlet	on	the	Holodeck, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p228"></a>Janet	Murray	describes	Groundhog	Day	as	“the	most	successful	attempt	to portray	alternate	realities	within	a	coherent	linear	story	[…]	Because	of	[Phil’s]</p>
<p class="calibre1">simulation	structure,	Groundhog	Day,	though	it	has	none	of	the	shoot-‘em’up content	of	videogames,	is	as	much	like	a	videogame	as	a	linear	film	can	be”	(35-36).	By	contrast,	in	“The	Five	Stages	of	Writing	for	Interactive”	(1999),	Noah Falstein	wryly	appropriates	Groundhog	Day’s	structure	of	stages-of-grieving	as	a parable	for	the	trauma	of	linear	writers	struggling	to	adapt	their	craft	to	writing for	‘interactive’	[media].	Just	as	Groundhog	Day	“shows	us	what	it	might	be	like to	live	in	a	program	with	a	bug	in	its	loop	termination	conditions,”	the	aspiring interactive	author	experiences	choice	structures	as	a	disruption	of	the	natural order	of	narrative,	and	must	learn	to	cope.	This	analogy	contains	a	fascinating inversion	of	Murray’s	apparently	straightforward	formula	time-loop	=	game.	Just as	preconceptions	about	linear	narrative	trap	an	author,	and	she	must	struggle	in order	to	achieve	full	interactive	media	authorship,	so	Phil’s	interactive-media-like	structure	of	experience	traps	him,	and	he	must	struggle	to	achieve	a	normal experience	of	linear	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	is	a	commonality	in	Murray	and	Falstein’s	thinking	best	exemplified	by a	further	contrast	with	Ken	Sanes	argument	in	“More	on	Groundhog	Day” </p>
<p class="calibre1">(1998).	In	it,	Sanes	wields	the	film	to	critique	Sherry	Turkle’s	concept	of	the virtual	exploration	of	many	selves.	Sanes	sees	postmodern	multiple-identity	as	a morally	vacant,	anti-humanist	concept,	and	offers	Groundhog	Day	as	an alternate	parable	of	finding	the	one	true	self:</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	timeless	middle	of	the	movie	has	some	of	the	characteristics	of	a	virtual world	in	which	[Bill]	Murray	can	experiment	with	alternative	ways	of	living	and being.	In	that,	it	is	like	forms	of	fiction,	including	imagination.	Since	he participates	in	this	virtual	world,	perhaps	it	is	most	like	participatory	fictions	�</p>
<p class="calibre1">MUDs,	video	games,	virtual	realities.	The	movie	similarly	seeks	to	be	our timeless	interlude	in	which	we	can	try	on	different	ways	of	living. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sherry	Turkle	[…]	sees	MUDs	or	text-based,	interactive	fictional	worlds	on the	Internet	as	such	a	virtual	world,	allowing	one	to	try	on	different	selves.	But she	believes	that	they	(and	other	participatory	forms	of	fiction)	allow	us	to discover	that	we	are	many	selves,	all	of	which	turn	out	to	be	fictions.	In	Turkle’s view,	life	is	a	kind	of	game,	a	form	of	theater,	and	the	fiction	in	stories	isn’t much	different	than	the	fiction	of	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	believe	the	correct	conclusion	is	precisely	the	opposite:	fiction,	whether</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p229"></a>participatory	or	vicarious,	allows	us	to	identify	with	and	play	characters	who find	their	true	selves,	thereby	putting	us	in	touch	with	the	universal	human nature	in	each	of	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	kind	of	cyclical	time	is	Groundhog	Day,	and	how	does	its	representation serve	these	quite	different	positions?	Writing	in	a	1996	class	of	Janet	Murray’s on	NonLinear	Narrative	and	Interactive	Fiction,	Freedom	Baird	charts	the	plot arc	of	Groundhog	Day	as	an	engagement	with	responsibility.	Phil’s	initial reaction	to	consequence-less	experience	is	to	make	increasingly	irresponsible, meaningless	choices,	but	his	choices	must	become	responsible	(that	is,	invested with	meaning)	before	they	can	become	consequential	(literally,	restored	to	the flow	of	time	and	thus	capable	of	consequence). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	41.	Baird	traces	engagement	with	responsibility	as	it	fluctuates	over	the course	of	Groundhog	Day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Baird’s	chart	suggests	a	shared	term.	The	strange	instability	in	discussing Groundhog	Day	has	to	do	with	our	deepest	ambivalences	regarding consequential	choice.	Does	simulation	obscure	and	debase	meaningful	actions, or	does	it	inform	and	vindicate	them?	Groundhog	Day	narrates	how	simulation-repetition	might	do	both.	Phil’s	progress	toward	embracing	meaningful	choices thus	serves	as	a	parable	for	Falstein’s	ideas	of	good	interactive	writing,	just	as	it serves	Sanes	in	his	rejection	of	postmodern	proliferation	of	identity	and	the alleged	arbitrary	or	meaningless	quality	of	multiple	virtual	selves.	Groundhog Day	is	a	parable	about	a	sandbox	simulation	that	matters	�	a	Bildungsroman	of interactivity.	The	ethical	stake	in	this	player’s-progress	is	located	differently depending	on	each	critic’s	sympathies.	For	simulationists,	the	Groundhog	Day loop	is	rhetorically	potent	and	inspires	growth,	validating	the	potential	of simulations.	For	anti-simulationists,	the	loop’s	main	significance	is	that,	like childish	things,	it	can	be	outgrown	and	put	aside.	Sanes	goes	so	far	as	to	argue that	“[Bill]	Murray’s	character	treats	his	life	as	a	game	only	when	he	is	in despair,”	although	this	is	clearly	not	the	case;	the	final	quarter	of	the	movie	deals with	a	visibly	hopeful	Phil	as	he	daily	negotiates	his	clockwork	town	with	the brisk	mastery	of	an	expert	player	at	a	well-loved	game.	But	Sanes’s	misstep reflects	a	common	confusion	in	the	easy	slide	from	speaking	of	a	game	(or	rule-bounded	repeatable	scenario)	as	“a	thing	of	no	consequence”	to	later	speaking	of a	game	as	“a	thing	of	no	significance.”	Sanes	may	have	meant	that	Phil	treats	life as	insignificant	(having	no	worth	or	meaning)	while	in	despair,	and	this	would	be true,	but	it	is	an	observation	that	should	lead	us	to	the	film’s	unique	existential</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p230"></a>position	�	an	ethics	of	simulation.	Phil	eventually	decides	that	his	actions, while	profoundly	inconsequential	(having	no	lasting	impact),	are	still	significant (i.e.	important).	Thereafter,	Phil	plays	on,	but	chooses	a	serious	game.	This	idea of	repetition	engagement	as	a	moral	discourse	will	permeate	our	close interactions	with	Rematch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	Phil,	Kurt	moves	through	a	deterministic	universe	in	Rematch	in	which interactions,	once	known,	are	repeatable.	Unlike	Phil,	however,	this	mastery	is only	quantitative	exploration,	not	qualitative	improvement.	Phil	masters	tossing playing	cards	into	a	hat	(in	“about	six	months”),	but	no	matter	how	many	times Kurt	attempts	to	break	the	formation	of	pool	balls,	the	result	never	changes.	Like Phil,	Kurt	begins	as	a	profoundly	isolated	individual	who	becomes	further isolated	by	his	knowledge	of	the	past	and	future.	But	while	Phil	moves	through the	seamless	looping	of	Groundhog	Day’s	clockwork	universe	alone,	and	thus must	ultimately	look	into	himself	to	find	meaning	and	significance,	Kurt	senses in	Rematch’s	jarring	retakes	the	presence	of	an	active,	external	“hand,”	which intervenes	every	time	the	interactor	chooses	to	UNDO: You	feel	a	tremendous	wrench	�	the	hand	of	God	coming	down	to	wipe	clean the	temporal	chalkboard.	Somehow	things	aren’t	set	up	exactly	the	same	as	last time…. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kurt’s	feeling	of	divine	intervention	does	not	indicate	the	direct	action	of	the interactor,	who	has	not	and	cannot	specify	a	different	“set	up.”	Rather,	“the hand”	signifies	the	author,	system,	or	code,	which	constantly	resets	the	pieces	of the	simulation,	but	with	a	difference. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	42.	The	cartoon-staircase	sequence	of	Lola	rennt	(1998)	locates	the original	source	of	chaos	and	variation	outside	the	cinematic	realism	that characterizes	the	rest	of	the	film. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	1998	Tom	Tykwer	film	Lola	rennt	(a.k.a.	Run	Lola	Run),	small-time smuggler	Manni	loses	a	bag	of	one	hundred	thousand	Deutsche	Marks	on	the subway.	With	twenty	minutes	before	his	boss	is	due	to	pick	up	the	money,	Manni calls	his	girlfriend	Lola	for	help,	leaving	her	dashing	to	borrow	the	money	from her	banker	father	and	get	the	money	to	Manni	in	time.	Unlike	the	town	of Punxsutawny,	which	soon	holds	few	surprises	for	Phil,	the	Berlin	of	Lola	rennt is	a	chaotic	landscape	in	which	each	small	change	is	a	new	butterfly	effect spawning	unintended	consequences.	Lola	races	the	streets	three	times,	each</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p231"></a>course	intricately	and	increasingly	different	in	its	particulars	as	it	progresses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	initial	source	of	variations,	strangely,	is	not	Lola	herself,	who	makes	an identical	decision	in	all	three	runs	to	visit	her	father’s	bank.	Instead,	the	camera deviates	each	time	she	enters	the	staircase	of	her	apartment	complex,	zooming tight	to	her	mother’s	television	screen	as	it	displays	a	cartoon	version	of	Lola descending	stairs	only	to	be	confronted	by	a	cartoon	man	and	dog.	In	each encounter	the	pair	respectively	glower	at	her,	trip	her,	and	attempt	to	block	her way,	and	the	outcome	of	this	altercation	appears	to	affect	the	real	Lola	who	we next	see	emerge	from	the	bottom	of	her	real	stairwell.	For	both	Kurt	and	Lola variation	has	an	almost	mystic	origin,	located	both	outside	the	protagonists’</p>
<p class="calibre1">agency	and	outside	the	predominant	generic	discourse	of	the	works	(realism). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	Lola,	Kurt	encounters	a	world	of	changes.	This	world	is	not	chaotic,	but	it is	apparently	arbitrary	and	even	hostile	in	its	variety.	Unlike	Lola,	for	whom apparently	negative	variations	hold	the	potential	for	new	positive	possibilities, the	differences	that	confront	Kurt	seem	purely	oppressive,	as	they	complicate	his struggle	to	discern	an	alternative	to	the	fatal	accident. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	additional	complication	to	locating	Kurt	in	relation	to	these	time-loop films	is	the	knowledge	of	the	protagonists.	Where	Phil	Connors	is	the	only	one in	Punxsutawney	whose	consciousness	transcends	the	limits	of	the	repeating Groundhog	Day,	and	he	acts	in	full	knowledge	of	every	previous	day,	Lola’s consciousness	is	bounded	by	the	limits	of	her	allotted	twenty-minute	run.	Only Lola’s	unconscious	has	knowledge	of	her	previous	runs,	and	she	appears	to experience	this	as	a	kind	of	premonition	or	d�j�	vu	(in	the	simulation,	these are	generally	topologically	equivalent).	We	might	first	glimpse	an	example	of this	in	her	more	confident	second	reaction	to	the	cartoon	dog	(which	she attempts	to	pass	without	fear,	perhaps	based	on	their	last	encounter),	but	a	more definitive	example	appears	in	the	second	scenario	in	which	she	uses	a	stolen	gun to	rob	her	father’s	bank.	In	the	act	of	threatening	her	father,	Lola	pauses	and	the camera	focuses	suddenly	on	the	gun	safety,	which	she	calmly	disengages, reenacting	the	instructions	Manni	gave	her	during	the	botched	grocery	store robbery	that	ended	her	previous	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kurt’s	consciousness	is	both	constrained	by	the	operations	of	time	(like	Lola, or	Billy	Blake)	and	at	the	same	time	unconstrained	(like	Phil	Connors	or	Thomas Xavier).	His	consciousness	is	largely	trapped	within	the	cycle,	where	it	cannot learn	to	throw	a	ball,	master	the	art	of	persuasion,	or	effect	any	of	the	changes that	might	be	available	to	someone	like	Phil	Connors.	Like	Lola’s	d�j�	vu, Kurt	has	paranormal	access	to	information	through	the	interactor	and	the	system, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p232"></a>which	together	serve	as	his	transcendental	consciousness.	Unlike	Lola’s moments	of	unspoken	and	understated	intuition,	Kurt’s	knowledge	can	surge	to the	forefront:</p>
<p class="calibre1">TELL	NICK	AND	INES	ABOUT	SUV</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nick:	You	tell	Nick	about	the	black	SUV,	but	he	doesn’t	believe	your	crazy story	about	premonitions	and	repeated	lives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ines:	You	tell	Ines	about	the	black	SUV,	but	she	says,	“C’mon,	Kurt,	how would	you	know	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">[…]</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	glass…a	black	SUV…you	watch	yourself	and	Ines	and	Nick	die	as	if	in	a dream,	as	if	you’ve	experienced	it	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	Kurt	can	first	describe	the	SUV	crash	and	then	die	with	a	dull,	detached recognition	as	if	he	has	experienced	it	before	is	a	sign	of	the	difficult	balancing act	Rematch	is	attempting	to	maintain,	not	always	successfully.	At	stake	is Kurt’s	relationship	to	the	time-loop	and	the	cycle,	which	the	interactor eventually	realizes	are	not	in	fact	the	same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	key	is	variation.	Variation	in	the	pool	hall	is	also	an	implicit	challenge	to both	Kurt	and	the	interactor:	a	game	is	afoot,	and	may	be	won	if	properly understood.	The	trick	is	in	discerning	significance.	Rematch	is	extremely verbose,	and	the	transcript	is	awash	with	incidental	details	that	seem	immaterial to	the	survival	of	Kurt	and	his	friends.	Conversational	patter	fills	the	air, different	music	plays	across	loudspeaker	in	the	background,	and	the	numbering tables	constantly	shift	each	time	we	UNDO.	One	man	wears	a	different	sports cap	each	time.	Ines’s	jacket	and	cell	phone	cycle	through	a	variety	of	colors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rematch	exists	within	the	possibility	space	of	these	variables,	but	unlike	any	of the	examples	considered	thus	far	these	examples	also	precede	the	work.	The causes	of	these	differences	(wearing	a	hat	or	buying	a	phone)	should	precede	not only	the	moment	of	the	accident	but	also	the	entire	evening.	Unlike	Groundhog Day,	this	is	not	a	deterministically	invariant	world,	but	neither	is	it	a	chaotic butterfly	effect	world,	in	which	rooting	for	a	different	team	or	buying	a	different phone	in	the	past	should	lead	to	a	significantly	different	present	�	in	particular, one	without	the	accident.	Instead,	we	experience	a	set	of	closely	parallel universes	appearing	together,	either	joined	by	the	inexorable	approach	of	a	black</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p233"></a>SUV	or	perhaps	(as	in	Shrapnel)	fragmented	apart	around	the	event	of	its	impact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	center	of	this	impact	is	Kurt,	a	possibility-hopping	protagonist	whose	only distinguishing	feature	on	self-examination	is	“the	indistinct,	mismatched demeanor	and	apparel	of	someone	who’s	not	quite	sure	if	he’s	in	the	right lifetime.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	not	deterministic	or	chaotic,	neither	is	Rematch	totally	random	nor exhaustively	combinatorial.	Instead,	a	sequence	of	nine	variations	is	signaled	as the	interactor’s	session	progresses	via	Kurt’s	increasingly	algorithmic	sense	of d�j�	vu,	as	seen	here	in	his	47th	attempt	to	prevent	the	accident: Somehow	things	aren’t	set	up	exactly	the	same	as	last	time…. </p>
<p class="calibre1">…though	you	do	feel	a	sense	of	d�j�	vu	to	the	initial	surroundings	9	and	18</p>

<p class="calibre1">Of	millions	of	potential	scenarios,	only	nine	are	randomly	generated	at	the beginning	of	each	session,	and	these	nine	are	then	repeated	in	sequence	for	the duration	of	interactions	�	not	a	time-loop,	but	a	cycle	of	loops.	While	Kurt’s growing	certainty	that	the	period	of	the	cycle	is	nine	appears	as	diegetic	d�j�</p>
<p class="calibre1">vu,	the	“/2”is	an	extradiegetic	address	to	the	interactor	that	indicates	the	step	in that	sequence.	In	this	case,	the	situation	is	identical	to	the	second	crash	ever experienced.	This	is	the	true	“cycle,”	and	it	is	discernible	to	the	interactor	by careful	observation,	but	also	directly	perceived	and	reported	on	by	Kurt.	This excessively	particular	description	“9	and	18	and	27”	strikes	me	as	an	error	of style	on	Rematch’s	part.	The	text	doesn’t	provide	much	more	information	than	if Kurt	were	to	recall	seeing	a	similar	detail	“about	nine	accidents	ago,”	but	the precise	tone	stretches	an	already	thin	fiction	about	Kurt’s	remarkable	memory, making	the	text	instead	appear	as	what	it	is:	no	part	of	Kurt,	but	rather	an emanation	from	the	code.	Regardless	of	whether	it	is	implied	in	too	heavy-handed	a	fashion	or	not,	understanding	this	period	of	repetition	is	crucial	to breaking	the	true	cycle.	Where	Shrapnel	purports	to	RESTART	(yet	obviously does	not),	Rematch	pretends	to	UNDO	(that	is,	restore	the	state	of	the	previous turn),	then	describes	itself	as	randomizing	(“things	aren’t	set	up	exactly	the same”),	and	finally	reveals	itself	as	sequencing	a	continuous	traversal	(through</p>
<p class="calibre1">“a	sense	of	d�j�	vu”).	The	actual	work	situates	itself	halfway	between	a	pure determinism	and	pure	change.	In	Rematch,	the	hand	of	God	does	“play	dice”	for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p234"></a>a	time,	but	it	leaves	off	so	that	Kurt	may	study	the	throws,	predict	the	next outcome,	and	successfully	intervene. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rematch	and	the	cavernous	story	space</p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	discussing	either	how	the	problem	of	random	complexity	is	resolved	in Rematch	or	the	significance	of	that	resolution,	let’s	consider	how	this	complexity is	aesthetically	accommodated	by	the	design	and	description	of	the	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consider	the	introductory	description:	a	largely	non-random	passage	which,	like the	challenge	with	Nick,	appears	only	in	the	annex	of	time	before	the	first interaction	and	crash,	but	which	can	be	consulted	thereafter	via	LOOK: At	Pool	Table	84</p>
<p class="calibre1">You	are	in	a	cavernous	pool	hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Around	you	through	the	gloom,	the	walls	and	rusted	pipes	are	caked	with faded	gray	paint.	Scuffed	black	and	white	floor	tiles	remind	you	of	a	disused	old barber	shop.	The	fans	overhead	resemble	buttons	on	a	giant’s	overcoat,	trim except	for	one	to	the	south	which	wobbles	on	a	loose	thread. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your	peers,	the	youth	of	the	city,	with	their	sleek	attire,	bright	expressions,	and sharp	caws	of	laughter,	flitter	in	and	out	of	the	dim	cones	of	light	illuminating the	pool	tables	that	encircle	yours	in	almost	every	direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	vast	pool	hall	resembles	a	purgatory	for	young	singles,	perhaps foreshadowing	the	purgation-like	experience	that	Kurt	will	soon	enter.	By	now, we	are	also	attuned	to	the	description	“cavernous”	as	surely	referencing	the Colossal	Cave.	This	opening	homage	to	Adventure	indicates	that	Rematch	is situating	itself	in	IF	traditions.	While	setting	this	traditionally	appropriate	tone, the	cavernous	nature	of	the	pool	hall	also	reinforces	the	structural	design	of	the work,	for	the	work	randomizes	a	crucial	location	within	an	extremely	large	set	of pool	tables	that	the	correspondingly	cavernous	hall	must	therefore	contain.	As such,	the	word	“cavernous”	marks	the	place	where	realism	is	first	undermined and	then	re-inscribed.	Permit	a	bit	of	back-of-the-napkin	math	illustrating	this connection:	using	the	smallest	regulation	pool	table	(3.5’	x	7’)	and	adding	a small	buffer	for	play	around	it	(3’	on	a	side),	two-hundred	tables	could	be	tightly packed	into	an	otherwise	empty	180’	x	130’	room.	The	pool	hall	is	thus	slightly smaller	than	half	an	American	football	field,	although	we	know	from	the description	and	arrangement	of	several	table-less	areas	that	the	floor	plan	is</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p235"></a>certainly	bigger	than	this	minimum	size.	Cavernous	indeed.	This	abundance	of tables	provides	for	an	impressive	range	of	numerical	reconfigurations,	and	thus serve	as	a	disincentive	to	trial-and-error	attempts	to	“break	the	cycle”	by referencing	tables	at	random,	creating	a	challenge	that	a	nine-table	pool	hall could	not.	This	disincentive	reinforces	the	sense	of	Rematch	as	a	puzzle	design. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only	intelligent	insights	(rather	than	exhaustive	explorations)	will	lead	to escape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	43.	Rematch’s	conceptual	geography.	Kurt’s	table	name	is	randomly chosen	out	of	twenty,	yet	is	always	nearest	the	path	of	the	oncoming	SUV,	just	as the	confused	patron’s	table	is	always	located	by	the	fan	controls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	might	argue	that	the	mere	word	“cavernous”	has	very	little	to	do	with	the design	or	the	experience	of	Rematch.	Unlike	most	visual	/	spatial	simulation systems,	textual	simulations	have	no	strict	need	to	reconcile	such	measures	and spaces.	The	hall	could	be	described	in	scriptons	as	“tiny”	while	code	randomizes the	texton	numbers	of	ten	thousand	pool	tables,	and	the	process	of	interrogating and	solving	Rematch	would	remain	structurally	the	same.	This	is	true.	In	fact, the	vast	scope	or	scale	of	pool	tables	in	the	cavernous	hall	probably	do	not register	with	most	Rematch	interactors,	at	least	not	to	the	extent	of	equating	it	to a	football	field.	If	Rematch	doesn’t	feel	vast,	what	is	the	point	of	expounding	on its	vastness?	What	is	important	I	would	argue	is	the	very	possibility	of	this	gap in	IF	between	how	the	prose	evokes	the	concept	of	the	cavernous	(e.g.	do	pool halls	this	big	even	exist?)	and	how	the	simulation	code	conveys	the	experience of	the	cavernous	(e.g.	are	actions	such	as	observing,	throwing,	yelling,	and	so forth	credible	in	the	space	as	described,	are	imaginable	actions	afforded,	and	are afforded	actions	imaginable?).	Taken	together,	these	twin	representations	of	the pool	hall	determine	the	work’s	relationship	to	mimetic	realism	or	abstract impressionism.	Whether	as	concrete	as	the	supermarket	of	Aisle	or	as	shifting	as the	dreamscape	of	Shrapnel,	any	representation	of	space	is	important	to	the extent	that	it	allows	the	interactor	to	imagine	and	assert	appropriate	events	at	the command	line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Semiotic	simulation	creates	the	possibility	of	an	evocatively	huge	and systematically	huge	space	that	is	then	examined	and	interacted	with	in	the	mode of	a	comfortably	intimate	realism.	Kurt,	Nick	and	Ines	interact	casually	with	an intricate	expanse	that	extends	out	around	them	in	all	directions	because	its	extent only	represents	one	kind	of	difficulty	(Kurt’s	formal	struggle	with	meaning)	but not	another	(the	group’s	ease	and	comfort	in	the	space,	which	renders	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p236"></a>accident	more	appalling).	This	special	screening	effect	is	beyond	the	power	of 2D	and	3D	graphical	representations,	in	which	the	depiction	of	a	cavernous space	simultaneously	frames	the	experience	of	perception	/	interaction	in	that space.	Space	in	Rematch	can	be	mapped	literally	�	indeed,	to	a	certain	degree	it must	be	�	but	it	also	has	a	literal	(that	is,	linguistic)	essence	separate	from	any possible	quantitative	representation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Take	for	example	the	two	hundred	pool	tables.	Regardless	of	what	table	Kurt find’s	himself	at	(and	the	number	constantly	changes)	he	always	finds	himself	in the	center	section	of	the	hall	(tables	81-100),	with	the	eight	other	sections	of	the hall	arranged	around	him	according	to	the	cardinal	and	ordinal	directions	of	the traditional	IF	compass	rose.	Kurt	has	one	turn	in	which	to	navigate	within	this rough-grained,	nine-section	grid.	Other	than	being	randomized,	the	arrangement of	tables	within	this	grid	is	neither	addressable	by	the	interactor	nor	apparently modeled	by	the	system.	Yet	no	matter	which	number	table	out	of	twenty	Kurt cycles	through,	that	table	is	always	closest	to	the	south	windows	and	thus	always in	the	path	of	the	crashing	SUV.	It	is	almost	impossible	to	reconcile	this	outcome with	a	numerically	fixed	floor	plan	in	which	Kurt	finds	himself	at	different tables.	Similarly,	out	of	one	hundred	tables	in	the	southwest	section	of	the	hall, the	confused	patron	is	always	at	a	different	table,	yet	inevitably	by	the	wall-mounted	fan	control	panel.	It	is	very	difficult	to	provide	a	floor	plan	such	that one	hundred	tables	(all	visible	to	Kurt)	are	all	conveniently	located	by	a	wall,	let alone	the	same	panel;	one	is	tempted	to	call	it	impossible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	are	we	as	interactors	to	visualize	this	cavernous	space?	Should	we visualize	it	at	all?	In	order	to	make	sense	of	the	events	that	transpire,	we	must assume	a	relatively	fixed	floor	plan.	This	in	turn	requires	that	we	reconcile	the transcript’s	constantly	shifting	table	numbers	by	imagining	a	bizarrely	haphazard sequence	of	alternate	table	numbering	schemes	applied	to	that	fixed	floor	plan across	the	various	realities	in	which	Kurt	appears	at	the	same	(renamed)	physical position.	Kurt’s	table,	by	any	other	name,	is	always	closest	to	the	window,	and thus	is	always	hit	by	the	SUV	�	that	is	its	transcendental	nature. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p237"></a>Rematch	and	parallel	language	games My	goal	in	drawing	out	the	difficulty	of	visualizing,	mapping,	or	generally orienting	ourselves	to	Rematch’s	representations	is	not	to	argue	that	the	space	of Rematch	is	either	flawed	as	a	simulation	or	imperfectly	realist	as	a	narrative (although	certainly	there	are	other	design	choices	which	could	close	this	gap). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rather,	interacting	closely	with	Rematch	reveals	that	the	work	makes	its	own kind	of	sense.	Like	Shade’s	potted	plant	�	be	it	hyacinth,	spider-plant,	palm,	or cactus	�	some	aspects	of	Kurt’s	world	have	consistent	identities	in	code	that	are distinct	from	their	names.	These	logical	essences	are	based	in	what	they	do,	not what	they	are	called.	Rematch	is	an	economy	of	references.	In	this	language game,	incidentals	(jacket	colors,	table	numbers)	are	constantly	reshuffled	by	a hidden	hand,	yet	the	underlying	relationships	between	those	relabeled	surfaces remain	fixed.	The	laws	of	temporal	flux	in	which	Kurt	finds	himself	trapped resemble	the	laws	of	the	TADS	source	code	with	which	Rematch	was	written	�</p>

<p class="calibre1">This	name	shuffling	has	two	primary	significances	for	our	close	interacting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First,	it	reflects	a	general	functionalist	worldview,	and	is	thus	crucial	to	the solution	to	the	problem	of	the	pool	hall	accident.	Second,	it	serves	as	a	specific parable	for	Kurt’s	emotional	frustrations,	and	is	thus	crucial	to	the	meaning	of the	work.	Beginning	with	an	exploration	of	the	pool	hall	reveals	a	basic	circuit of	social	communication	resembling	a	switch.	By	the	bathrooms,	a	loudmouthed customer	bellows	numerically-loaded	phrases.	These	appear	to	have	an	unusual unintended	effect:</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girl	behind	the	counter	squeals	and	sniggers	with	her	bearlike	boyfriend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon	hearing	an	explosive	“4!”	from	the	north,	the	girl	gives	a	little	start	and turns	on	the	microphone	to	say	in	a	bored	monotone,	“Table	4,	table	4,	your	time is	up,	please	bring	your	equipment	to	the	counter.”	Then,	with	a	dreamy	smile, she	turns	back	to	her	boyfriend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	response,	you	see	a	commotion	at	the	pool	tables	numbered	1-20	to	the northwest	and,	curiously	enough,	at	the	pool	tables	numbered	101-200	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p238"></a>west. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	narrator	apparently	disapproves	of	the	attendant’s	romantic preoccupations.	This	is	not	entirely	without	cause,	as	the	attendant’s	distraction leaves	her	an	impressionable	automaton	or	message-passer.	Prompted	by whatever	number	the	loudmouth	yells,	she	recalls	the	corresponding	table, directing	the	occupants	to	cease	playing	pool	before	their	allotted	time	has expired.	This	leads	to	a	commotion	in	the	northwest,	the	first	position	of	the metaphoric	‘switch’	where	the	message	grounds	out	and	customers	are	unjustly recalled	early.	A	second,	potential	position	is	indicated	by	a	simultaneous commotion	in	the	southwest,	where	another	angry	customer	mishears	the recalled	number,	but	is	reassured	by	a	friend…	just	in	time	to	avert	him smashing	his	pool	cue	into	the	ceiling	fan	controls.	These	controls	are significant.	An	unsteady	ceiling	fan	hangs	along	the	path	of	the	incoming	SUV, and	disrupting	it	might	cause	the	disturbance	needed	to	rout	Kurt’s	group	and save	them	from	the	accident.	There	are	many	ways	to	attempt	to	affect	the	fan, either	directly	or	via	the	panel,	via	the	customer,	via	the	attendant,	and	so	forth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	of	these	possibilities	have	been	disallowed.	As	with	a	Rube	Goldberg machine,	in	which	only	the	crowing	of	a	rooster	can	(eventually)	butter	the	toast, the	only	way	to	drop	the	fan	will	be	to	prompt	the	loudmouth	with	a	number	and watch	the	logic	of	the	pool	hall	work	itself	out.	Only	the	unjust	recall	of	the angry	customer’s	table	can	affect	the	fan,	so	the	message	content	must	be	the number	of	that	customer’s	table	number.	Unfortunately,	there	is	no	way	for	Kurt to	both	investigate	the	number	and	pass	it	on	during	his	allotted	span	of	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only	through	learning	and	recording	the	steps	of	the	cycle	can	the	number	later be	‘foreseen’	and	its	recurrence	acted	upon.	Once	Kurt	has	mastered	the recurrent	future	of	the	cycle,	all	that	remains	is	for	him	to	transmit	the	correct number	to	the	loudmouth.	As	it	turns	out,	one	person	has	both	the	instrument	(a desk	calendar	with	numbered	pages)	and	the	means	(a	strong	throwing	arm)	of transmitting	this	number:	Ines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	thematically	significant	that	the	pool-hall’s	communication	system	is misfiring	due	to	the	romantic	relationship	of	the	attendant.	Just	as	the	shifting namespace	of	the	landscape	reflects	the	operations	of	the	underlying	code,	so	too it	seems	to	echo	the	shape	of	Kurt’s	relationships	to	Nick	and	Ines.	Kurt,	having failed	either	to	best	Nick	or	to	woo	Ines,	finds	himself	clinging	to	the	dwindling hope	that	there	are	social	means	of	achieving	his	dreams.	Yet	small	talk	and banter	seem	to	lie	on	the	surface	of	the	deep	structures	of	his	already-determined and	immutable	relationships.	Verbal	sparring	and	conversational	antics	cannot</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p239"></a>prevent	the	growing	intimacy	between	Nick	and	Ines,	nor	can	they	reverse Kurt’s	inevitable	drift	into	the	position	of	third	wheel.	Social	interactions become	mere	surface	details,	whose	superficial	content	(what	specific	words	are whispered,	which	specific	dares	are	exchanged,	etc.)	belies	the	deeper	meanings that	Kurt	can	discern	but	feels	powerless	to	alter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kurt’s	imprisonment	in	the	cycle,	in	other	words,	is	only	the	overt	form	of constraint	that	makes	up	this	work’s	frustration	aesthetics.	While	the	external oppression	of	the	cycle	limits	him	as	harshly	as	the	protagonists	of	other	works when	they	are	crazed,	drugged,	enchanted	and	so	forth,	Kurt’s	frustrated functionalist	goal	(the	inability	to	save	the	lives	of	his	social	circle)	is	an intensified	form	of	his	earlier	frustrated	emotional	goal	(his	inability	to	feel significant	or	meaningful	within	his	social	circle).	The	process	of	the	cycle amplifies	Kurt’s	preexisting	sense	of	alienation	from	before	and	outside	the cycle,	introducing	a	further	set	of	social	alienations	familiar	to	time	travelers: having	one’s	past	interactions	constantly	forgotten,	having	one’s	credibility discounted,	and	so	forth.	Yet	if	the	cycle	hurts	Kurt,	it	also	helps	him,	because	it rationalizes	Kurt’s	feelings,	both	in	the	sense	of	making	them	justified	(he	is,	in fact,	objectively	trapped	in	an	unfair	situation)	and	in	the	sense	of	making	them logically	tractable	(becoming	worthwhile	is	now	an	objective	problem	of	life	and death	rather	than	a	subjective	problem	of	popularity).	In	this	sense,	the	SUV’s violation,	while	horrific,	is	a	welcome	shift	away	from	the	unwinnable	social drama	around	the	pool	table.	Where	his	intractable	interpersonal	problems	were almost	beyond	words,	here	they	are	reframed	in	terms	of	functional	causality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	a	Newtonian	physics	problem,	or	like	the	toy-physics	problems	of	the	pool table,	the	question	concerns	the	proper	application	of	forces	necessary	to displace	three	bodies	in	space.	Most	importantly,	Kurt’s	desire	to	win	a	rematch is	at	last	ennobled	by	virtue	of	his	new	situation.	While	initially	wanting	to influence	his	peers	in	order	to	gain	their	love	and	respect,	his	hope	is	transmuted by	the	presence	of	dire	emergency	into	needing	to	manipulate	them	in	order	to save	their	lives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet	this	life-and-death	context	does	not	reveal	to	Kurt	the	triviality	of	his previous	social	problems.	Rather,	it	reinforces	and	legitimates	his	preexisting frustrations	with	his	friends.	Their	intricate	social	interactions	and	precious languages	games,	which	normally	mark	their	superiority	in	what	Kurt	describes as	“this	swirling	menagerie	of	life”	are	revealed	in	the	shadow	of	the	crash	to	be mere	obstructions	when	plain	talk	and	simple	actions	are	required,	counting	for little	except	to	commit	them	to	their	deaths.	Just	as	the	nature	of	the	pool	hall	is</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p240"></a>such	that	Kurt	is	always	at	the	table	where	he	dies,	the	natures	of	his	friendships are	such	that	he	cannot	lead	his	friends	to	safety	�	at	least,	not	directly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	45.	Communication	relationships	in	Rematch.	Kurt’s	commands	are interdicted	by	either	direct	refusal	(gaps)	or	indirect	refusal	(dashes).	The	correct solution	is	for	Kurt	to	WHISPER	to	Nick	that	he	should	DARE	Ines	to	take some	action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	do	these	friendships	work?	Rematch	constantly	demonstrates possibilities	for	social	interaction	as	part	of	its	varied	background	chatter,	and these	include	four	major	methods	of	communication	between	the	friends:	TELL, ASK,	WHISPER,	and	DARE.	Rematch	already	allows	the	interactor	to	suggest complex	actions,  <i class="calibre3">e.g. </i>	THROW	YOUR	CUE	STICK	AND	NICK’S	CUE	STICK</p>
<p class="calibre1">AT	THE	CEILING	FAN.	Communicating	in	Rematch	allows	Kurt	to	raise	topics and	ask	questions,	but	it	also	allows	him	to	suggest	complex	actions	to	his friends,	including	message	passing.	This	results	in	some	of	the	most	complex utterances	yet	supported	by	any	IF	parser.	Unfortunately,	whether	orders, challenges,	or	polite	requests,	these	command	lines	are	usually	refused.	Part	of the	reason	for	this	is	the	immutable	character	that	underlies	each	friend’s	varied antics.	Ines	is	innately	contrary	and	standoffish,	but	quick	to	take	a	dare,	while Nick	is	innately	too	proud	to	be	ordered	or	dared,	but	responds	to	both	polite requests	and	whispered	secrets.	What	further	complicates	this	situation	is	the dynamic	introduced	by	their	imminent	romance.	Ines	will	not	respond	now	even to	dares	from	Kurt,	or	indeed	to	any	idea	originating	from	him	whatsoever:</p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	ASK	NICK	TO	DARE	INES	TO	THROW	THE	EIGHT	BALL	AT	THE</p>
<p class="calibre1">CEILING	FAN</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	since	you	asked	nicely….”	he	says,	thinking	about	it.	Nick	turns	to	Ines and	dares	her,	“Throw	the	eight	ball	at	the	wobbling	ceiling	fan.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ines	wavers,	watching	Nick	closely.	Following	a	dare	from	you,	albeit indirectly,	apparently	will	cost	her	some	standing	in	Nick’s	eyes.	“Nah,”	she	tells you	finally.	“Sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	an	emotional	standpoint,	this	is	a	blow	to	Kurt,	both	as	a	judgment	on him	and	an	exclusion	from	dares	as	a	form	of	intimacy.	Indeed,	part	of	Kurt’s freedom	to	act	throughout	the	cycle	stems	from	the	fact	that	Nick	and	Ines	are periodically	asking	and	daring	each	other	to	do	things	but	leaving	him	to	his	own</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p241"></a>devices.	From	a	functionalist	standpoint,	this	exclusion	is	not	a	slight	but	a	crisis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kurt	is	physically	ineffectual	and	Nick	is	injured,	so	only	Ines	has	the	throwing arm	to	propel	Kurt’s	signal	into	the	circuit	of	the	pool	hall.	Unable	to	act	on	his own,	Ines	is	the	body	through	which	Kurt	can	find	agency.	Yet	she	will	have nothing	to	do	with	him,	and	so	dooms	them	to	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	with	the	pool	hall,	romantic	distractions	at	Kurt’s	table	engender	broken communications.	Romance	is	in	fact	killing	him.	As	with	the	pool	hall,	the workaround	is	indirection.	Kurt	can	WHISPER	to	Nick	that	he	should	DARE</p>

It	is	an	impossibly intricate	solution	to	an	intractable	situation. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Both	the	apparently	arbitrary	nature	of	naming	in	the	cycle	and	the	apparently unproductive	nature	of	social	interaction	are	in	the	end	part	of	the	puzzle	of Rematch.	Like	the	shopper	of	Aisle	whose	positive	outcomes	were	generally social	interactions	(FIND	CLARE,	ASK	WOMAN	ABOUT	NAME)	rather	than physical	actions,	Kurt	comes	to	understand	both	the	pool	hall	and	his	social circle	not	as	physics	problems,	but	as	language	games	that	he	alone	can	learn	to play,	and	his	quest	for	words	of	power	culminates	in	discovering	a	speech	act that	can	actually	do	something,	changing	the	course	of	life	around	him.	The	final resolution	is	the	closed	circuit,	a	Rube	Goldberg	machine	indeed:	Nick	is prompted,	Ines	is	dared,	the	number	is	chosen	and	a	ball	is	used	to	throw	it,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p242"></a>loudmouth	exclaims,	the	attendant	mis-recalls	that	table	number,	the	angry customer	strikes	the	fan	controls,	and	at	last	the	fan	falls,	scattering	Kurt’s	table before	the	accident	hits	(see	Appendix	A:	Rematch,	the	final	move). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rematch	beyond	the	“wet	thump”	of	endings</p>
<p class="calibre1">With	the	black	SUV	avoided,	Kurt’s	triumph	culminates	in	a	final	exchange among	the	three	friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nick	whoops.	“Ines,	you	saved	us!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ines	looks	a	little	stunned.	“Did	I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes!”	Nick	assures	her.	He	kisses	her	fiercely.	“You	saved	us	all!	Kurt,	isn’t that	great?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	she	didn’t�”	you	begin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ines	and	Nick,	flush	and	happy,	turn	to	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	pause.	There	won’t	be	any	way	to	redo	this	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing,”	you	say	slowly.	“I’m	glad	everybody’s	safe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	glad	too,”	Ines	says	quietly,	smiles	at	you,	and	takes	Nick’s	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">–-	You	have	finally	broken	the	cycle	–-</p>
<p class="calibre1">That	Kurt	is	at	last	truly	released	is	signaled	by	the	AUTO	command	failing	to restart	the	simulation	�	although	the	curious	or	perverse	interactor	can	always choose	to	re-enter	the	cycle	after	it	has	been	broken.	Perhaps	unsurprisingly, Kurt’s	intellectual	progress	in	overcoming	the	accident	is	paralleled	by	the progress	in	emotional	maturity	that	finally	enables	him	to	accept	his	friends’</p>
<p class="calibre1">budding	relationship.	It	is	in	fact	quite	possible	that	this	second	progress	is	the true	accomplishment	that	stills	the	“hand	of	God.”	Just	as	the	lost	pool	game (“Beaten	once”)	and	Nick’s	invitation	to	break	was	the	true	initiation	into	the cycle	that	preceded	the	first	accident,	so	this	quiet	exchange	with	his	friends	may be	the	true	cycle-breaking	event,	a	change	of	heart	not	unlike	the	moment	that releases	Coleridge’s	ancient	mariner	from	his	curse	in	The	Rime	of	the	Ancient Mariner	(1798):</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p243"></a>O	happy	living	things!	no	tongue Their	beauty	might	declare:</p>
<p class="calibre1">A	spring	of	love	gushed	from	my	heart, </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	I	blessed	them	unaware:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sure	my	kind	saint	took	pity	on	me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	I	blessed	them	unaware. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	the	final	passage	demonstrates	that	Kurt	has	made	progress	both intellectually	and	emotionally,	the	mechanism	for	the	interactor	tracing	and reenacting	this	second,	emotional	progress	is	not	as	clear,	and	the	outcome	(“you pause”)	is	both	automatic	and	considerably	more	guarded	and	ambivalent	than the	mariner’s	blessings.	It	may	be	that	incidental	exposure	to	his	friends’	foibles over	several	hundred	repetitions	has	prepared	Kurt	to	appreciate	them	as individuals	and	release	them	to	their	own	fates.	On	the	other	hand,	it	may	also	be that	the	act	of	diagramming	the	limits	of	their	social	communications	has prepared	Kurt	to	accept	the	fact	that	he	can	only	relate	to	Ines	indirectly	through Nick.	If	so,	the	interactor	implicitly	accepts	this	lesson	by	solving	the	puzzle	of the	game	using	a	whisper.	This	act	of	whispering	comes	to	stand	for	Kurt’s assuming	his	place	willingly,	forsaking	the	role	of	hero,	and	realizing	that	he doesn’t	need	to	overcome	Nick	or	win	anything.	It	is	the	end	of	agon,	and	what matters	is	that	everyone	is	safe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	is	a	dark	side	to	this	reading,	however.	If	Kurt’s	familiarity	with	Nick and	Ines	may	have	bred	acceptance,	that	familiarity	may	also	have	bred contempt.	This	interpretation	is	grounded	in	part	in	the	fact	that	Rematch’s resolution	is	fundamentally	manipulative.	Where	other	deterministic	works	such as	Groundhog	Day	address	the	potentials	of	manipulation	in	the	middle	act	but ultimately	dismiss	them	as	cheapening	the	human	spirit,	Rematch	elevates manipulation	to	an	art,	and	it	is	difficult	not	to	be	a	bit	troubled	by	how	Nick	and Ines	are	reduced	to	mechanisms	in	the	service	of	that	process.	Other	reservations about	Kurt’s	metamorphosis	are	grounded	in	the	many	failed	outcomes	of Rematch	and	the	portrait	they	paint	of	his	friends,	particularly	how	they	comport themselves	as	accident	survivors	and	as	collaborators. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	accidents	in	Rematch	are	of	two	types:	either	the	normal	triple-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p244"></a>manslaughter	that	proceeds	so	long	as	the	three	main	characters	remain	at	their table,	or	the	death	of	Nick	and	Ines,	which	Kurt	witnesses	if	he	explores	in	any direction	other	than	the	south.	Just	as	the	death	of	Manni	in	the	second	scenario of	Lola	rennt	restarts	the	time-loop	despite	the	ongoing	survival	of	nominal protagonist	Lola,	Kurt’s	survival	as	the	protagonist	is	not	enough	to	escape	the time-loop	because	the	crisis	is	not	about	individual	success,	but	about maintaining	relationships	�	Kurt,	Ines,	and	Nick	must	all	survive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	detached	“you	watch	yourself”	notwithstanding,	Rematch	is	consistently narrated	in	the	second	person	from	Kurt’s	limited	point	of	view.	The	best examples	of	this	limited	viewpoint	is	“The	pool	balls	swarm	toward	your face�”	an	almost	cinematic	sentence	whose	interruption	usually	signals	Kurt’s first	of	many	deaths.	Likewise,	Kurt	is	interrupted	after	walking	towards	the window	as	the	SUV	approaches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	WALK	SOUTH</p>
<p class="calibre1">Right	by	the	front,	you	are	crushed	immediately,	and	so	you	don’t	survive long	enough	to	see	your	friends	die. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	limited	viewpoint	combined	with	the	fact	that	Kurt	can	only	push	a	friend to	safety	by	being	killed	himself	means	that	we	normally	get	only	the	briefest glimpses	of	Ines	and	Nick	as	survivors.	Yet	what	we	do	see	is	very	revealing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	Kurt’s	pleading	and	prognosticating	fails	to	alter	the	triple-manslaughter,	a more	direct	approaching	brings	limited	success.	“PUSH	NICK	NORTH”	for example	leaves	Nick	on	the	sidelines	of	the	accident,	shouting,	“My	God,	Ines, get	out	of	there!”	as	both	Kurt	and	Ines	suffer	their	usual	fate.	Nick’s	callous priorities	are	unsurprising,	if	perhaps	a	little	hurtful	to	the	martyr	who	saved him.	Yet	there	is	one	exception,	a	moment	at	which	Kurt	sees	and	hears	beyond death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	PUSH	NICK	AND	INES	NORTH</p>
<p class="calibre1">[…]</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nick	shouts	out,	“My	God,	Kurt,	get	out	of	there!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ines	says,	“Kurt,	no!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	you	can	move,	the	SUV	hits	your	pool	table	head-on,	crushing	you	into</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p245"></a>the	tabletop	with	a	wet	thump. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ines	cries,	“Kurt!	My	God,	Kurt!”	She	turns	to	Nick.	“He	sacrificed	himself	to save	us!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	little	grudgingly,	Nick	says,	“He	was	a	great	guy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I…I	love	him,”	Ines	says.	“I	didn’t	realize	it,	but	I	do.”	She	bursts	into	tears, and	Nick	comforts	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	neither	push	breaks	the	cycle,	the	second	push	breaks	the	narrator.	Who listens	in	on	Nick	and	Ines	after	Kurt	has	been	reduced	to	this	“wet	thump”? </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	this	wet	thump	might	differ	from	the	multitude	of	others	in	Rematch	by leaving	Kurt	lying	wounded,	this	seems	unlikely.	The	couple’s	behavior	at	his martyring	makes	it	seem	even	more	unlikely,	as	the	scene	looks	strikingly	like the	fulfillment	of	Kurt’s	deepest	fantasies.	Ines	declares	her	love	for	Kurt,	while Nick	is	shamed	into	showing	Kurt	respect.	Out	of	all	possible	worlds,	this	is	the world	where	he	has	finally,	irrevocably	won.	The	scene	might	be	legitimately glimpsed	in	Kurt’s	last	moments.	Alternately,	it	may	be	the	slip	of	an	unreliable narrator,	indicating	that	Kurt	controls	more	of	Rematch	than	he	is	letting	on.	In either	case	this	victory	scene	is	the	other	desire	of	Rematch,	a	desire	best articulated	in	Kurt’s	contemplation	of	Nick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	EXAMINE	NICK</p>
<p class="calibre1">You’ve	been	rivals	with	him	since	high	school:	for	grades,	for	friends,	for social	status	�	and	for	dates.	He’s	always	been	taller,	more	ruggedly	handsome than	you,	more	wise	and	cunning	�	this	pool	hall,	this	swirling	menagerie	of life,	has	always	been	more	his	arena	than	yours.	But	you	came	anyway,	even though	you’re	bound	to	lose,	again	and	again,	out	of	some	perverse, weatherbeaten	weed	of	hope	yet	to	be	uprooted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet	although	Kurt’s	hope	has	improbably	been	fulfilled	in	winning	Ines’s	love, the	victory	is	pyrrhic.	Here,	too,	the	inevitable	logic	of	Kurt’s	social	world	plays itself	out.	As	a	martyr,	all	he	can	accomplish	is	to	lead	his	friends	literally	into each	other’s	arms.	Kurt’s	posthumous	glimpse	or	imagining	of	Nick	and	Ines further	reconfirms	his	hostility	and	contempt	towards	them:	the	normally	polite Nick’s	grudging	manner	reveals	that	he	remains	an	entrenched	rival	even	when owing	his	life,	while	the	normally	tough	and	self-possessed	Ines	is	apparently revealed	in	her	shock	as	something	of	a	changeable	flake.	Certainly	her	dramatic</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p246"></a>declaration	of	love	is	hard	to	reconcile	with	the	comprehensive	and	systematic knowledge	of	her	disinterest	that	Kurt	has	and	will	acquire.	There	is	a	fine	line between	acceptance	of	his	friends	and	indictment	of	them,	and	in	the	context	of the	martyr	ending	it	is	hard	to	know	just	where	Kurt’s	final	emotional	victory stands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	surviving	the	accident	does	not	show	Nick	and	Ines	in	their	best	lights,	their roles	as	his	message-collaborators	are	significantly	more	damning.	In	the victorious	conclusion,	Kurt	secretly	tells	Nick	(apropos	of	nothing)	to	dare	Ines to	pelt	a	random	stranger	with	a	particular	significant	number.	Moments	later,	a fan	falls,	and	lives	are	saved.	Can	Nick	perceive	the	causal	connections	between Ines’s	throwing	and	the	fan	falling?	That	is,	does	he	notice	that	number	Kurt suggested	is	yelled,	then	rebroadcast,	then	reacted	to	across	the	room?	It	would not	be	strange	if	Nick	could	not	perceive	these	connections.	The	only	reason	that the	interactor-as-Kurt	understands	them	is	because	she	has	explored	the	hall	in parallel	timelines,	witnessed	its	patterns	at	painstaking	length,	and	learned	to read	its	relationships	via	the	cycle.	Yet,	at	the	conclusion,	the	specificity	of Kurt’s	request	and	Nick’s	participation	in	the	chain	has	apparently	also	prepared Nick	to	track	the	number	as	it	passes	around	the	room.	Unless	Nick	has perceived	the	number	in	transit,	his	statement	that	Ines	“saved”	everyone	is bizarre.	How	could	pelting	a	loudmouth	affect	a	car	crash?	In	order	to	make	his claim,	Nick	must	understand	its	basis,	which	means	that	he	must	also	know	that Kurt	is	the	source	of	his	salvation.	Nevertheless,	Nick	chooses	to	suppress	this knowledge	because	it	does	not	suit	his	romantic	purposes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	may	seem	vindictive	to	argue	that	Nick	willfully	misunderstands	and ignores	Kurt’s	solution.	One	of	the	joys	of	Rematch,	however,	is	that	we	can	test this	hypothesis	by	recruiting	Nick	and	Ines	to	pass	a	different	message	that	they are	less	satisfied	with	�	for	example,	triggering	the	premature	recall	of	their own	pool	game:</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girl	behind	the	counter	to	the	southeast	gives	a	little	start	and	turns	on	the microphone	to	say	in	a	bored	monotone,	“Table	81,	table	81,	your	time	is	up, please	bring	your	equipment	to	the	counter.”	Then,	with	a	dreamy	smile,	she turns	back	to	her	boyfriend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kurt,	why’d	you	do	that?”	Nick	demands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	that’s	our	table,”	Ines	adds.	“Now	we	have	to	stop	playing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p247"></a>The	glass…a	black	SUV…</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ironically,	instigating	the	recall	of	Kurt’s	own	table	should	save	the	group	by removing	them	from	their	situation.	Uncovering	this	outcome	makes	the	true ending	seem	deeply	ironic.	Due	to	the	secrecy	required	while	asking	Ines	for help,	Nick	holds	the	secret	of	what	Kurt	asked	him	to	say.	When	the	outcome	is bad,	he	immediately	reveals	Kurt’s	involvement	and	Ines	joins	him	in	blaming Kurt	for	the	loss	of	the	table;	while	they	are	objecting,	they	die.	When	the outcome	is	good,	however,	Nick	conveniently	forgets	Kurt’s	involvement,	and his	crediting	Ines	as	a	hero	becomes	yet	another	move	in	their	coalescing courtship	dance.	In	fact,	as	in	the	martyr	ending,	Kurt’s	heroism	becomes	the pretext	for	their	first	embrace.	Nick	moves	boldly	to	declare	Ines	the	hero, disclaiming	his	own	role	as	a	way	of	neatly	snipping	Kurt	out	of	the	relationship at	the	site	of	their	shared	secret.	He	has	enabled	Kurt	to	communicate	with	Ines for	the	moment	of	the	cycle,	but	that	moment	is	now	over.	Ines,	for	her	part,	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">“stunned”	and	uncharacteristically	pliant	in	accepting	Nick’s	assertion.	She either	doesn’t	know	what	Nick	is	talking	about	or	knows	better,	but	regardless she	accepts	whatever	story	is	his	pretext	for	their	romance.	Ines	and	Nick	turn	to face	a	bright	future	together,	willfully	blind	to	Kurt’s	preternatural	intuition	and the	tenuous	causal	chain	that	has	saved	their	lives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	left	fascinated	and	deeply	uncomfortable	with	Kurt’s	experience	after	it concludes.	If	the	basis	of	the	car	accident	cycle	is	displaced	aggression	�	a	kind of	passive	revenge	fantasy	in	which	the	fools	who	wouldn’t	listen	must	sadly	get what	they	deserve	�	then	the	victory	outcome	is	perhaps	an	incomplete transcendence	of	that	fantasy.	It	can	only	resolve	such	that	Kurt	goes	on	as	a secret	hero,	a	kind	of	gentler	version	of	the	dead	martyr	outcome.	It	is	also	hard not	to	be	suspicious	of	Kurt’s	newly	gained	perspective	and	transcendence	of pettiness,	given	that	his	scrupulously	maintained	mental	count	(e.g.	“Beaten	136</p>
<p class="calibre1">times”)	is	always	an	amalgam	of	petty	loss	with	brutal	death	(1	pool	game	lost	+</p>
<p class="calibre1">135	fatal	accidents).	This	speaks	to	a	certain	inherent	lack	of	perspective	that	the mere	fact	of	victory	cannot	entirely	erase.	Yet	I’m	also	aware	that	my	close interaction	has	strongly	privileged	some	interactions	over	others,	in	particular omitting	most	of	the	rich	texture	of	Nick	and	Ines	as	they	bustle	about	within	the cycle.	They	are	aggravating,	yet	charming	as	well.	That	these	are	not	simple people	or	relationships	is	evident,	and	the	interactor	with	the	courage	to	stand	in the	headlights	and	simply	chat	with	Kurt’s	friends	may	come	to	appreciate	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Part	of	the	triumph	of	Rematch	is	that	the	work	has	evoked	such	moral	anxiety in	me:	has	Kurt	has	failed	to	achieve	his	potential,	eking	a	cheap	moral</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p248"></a>superiority	out	of	what	could	be	a	deep	reconciliation?	He	has	broken	the	cycle, but	what	can	such	a	break	mean? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rematch	rewards	the	exploration	of	some	such	questions,	and	this	is	one	of them.	The	ending	takes	on	special	poignancy	if	the	interactor	actually	attempts to	play	on,	ignoring	the	oncoming	SUV	and	accepting	Nick’s	rematch	invitation to	‘break’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;	BREAK</p>
<p class="calibre1">First,	you	take	your	cuestick.	Then,	nervous,	you	don’t	put	enough	force behind	your	shot,	and	you	merely	graze	the	foremost	pool	ball.	The	formation barely	trembles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aw,”	Ines	says,	“You’ll	do	better	next	time!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet	Kurt	never	does	better	next	time,	neither	in	the	world	in	which	he	is immediately	killed	nor	in	the	world	beyond	the	cycle	where	everyone	is	okay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	matter	how	many	times	he	breaks,	the	formation	barely	trembles.	The	racked table	is	a	perfect	metaphor	for	his	situation	�	three	balls	at	the	center	of	a tightly	packed	formation,	waiting	for	Kurt’s	turn	to	pass	so	that	the	onrushing impact	can	blow	them	apart.	In	victory,	as	in	defeat,	the	pool	balls	will	be scattered	�	and	not	by	Kurt.	An	open	question	is	whether	breaking	the	cycle	has successfully	split	the	three	friends	up,	or,	alternately,	has	successfully	allowed them	to	remain	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Appendix	A:	Rematch,	the	final	move</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	solution	to	Rematch	uses	possibly	the	most	complex	parsed	command	in IF	to	date.	One	of	the	striking	things	about	this	solution	is	that	the	text	is	itself dynamically	generated	as	a	long	series	of	actions	computed.	For	the	interactor, the	first	half	of	the	passage	is	a	tour	de	force	of	previously	explored	affordances in	the	simulated	environment,	while	the	text	unique	to	this	particular	outcome begins	around	“smacks	the	ceiling	fan	controls.”	Because	text	is	generated	as each	action	is	resolved,	the	language	has	heavy	artifacts	typical	of	generators	�</p>

<p class="calibre1">The	paper	comes	off	and	flutters	in	the	air	as	the	ball	drops	to	the	floor.	The loudmouth	snatches	it,	uncurls	it,	reads	it,	and	hollers,	“Page	164,	‘Lone	Ranger in	bathroom	as	music	starts’,	the	best	Far	Side	cartoon	of	all	time?!?” </p>

<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	people	at	table	164	grasps	a	cuestick	as	if	to	smash	against	the nearest	surface	(in	this	case,	the	wall	dangerously	close	to	what	looks	like	the control	panel	for	the	ceiling	fans)	and	exclaims,	“Aw,	damn	it,	we	just	started!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	no	one	responds,	slam!	the	cuestick	smacks	the	ceiling	fan	controls, turning	them	all	off. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Forewarned,	you	scramble	away	from	the	table	before	the	SUV	hits	it,	head-on,	spraying	pool	balls	like	spittle	farther	into	the	hall,	before	lurching	to	a	stop. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p267"></a>Acknowledgments</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	am	deeply	grateful	to	my	advisor	and	mentor	Alan	Liu,	and	to	my	committee members	Rita	Raley	and	William	Warner,	not	only	for	shaping	and	promoting my	successes,	but	also	for	providing	the	occasions	for	them	in	countless collaboration	opportunities.	My	vita	can	only	begin	to	sketch	my	debt.	I	owe	like debts	to	my	earlier	mentors	Arden	Reed,	Paul	Saint-Amour,	and	Kathleen Fitzpatrick,	who	first	inspired	and	encouraged	my	calling	to	their	profession. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	study	wears	its	predecessors	on	its	sleeve,	particularly	authors	of	prior works	engaging	interactive	fiction	at	length:	Nick	Montfort,	Jimmy	Maher, Dennis	Jerz,	Espen	Aarseth,	Janet	Murray,	and	Sarah	Sloane.	To	Mary	Ann Buckles:	thank	you	for	being	a	trailblazer	for	us	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Raised	in	what	still	remains	a	largely	monastic	scholarly	system,	I	could	not have	endured	without	the	fresh	air	of	public	intellectual	life,	a	correspondence	I (and	my	peers)	largely	fashioned	around	blogs.	Many	unruly	ideas	threaded	their way	into	this	study	out	of	conversations	with	my	Writer	Response	Theory	co-conspirators	Mark	Marino	and	Christy	Dena,	my	Southern	California	new	media comrades	Jessica	Pressman	and	Noah	Wardrip-Fruin,	and	many	online interlocutors,	in	particular	the	members	of	Grand	Text	Auto. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	IF	communities	tempted	me	to	become	an	ethnographer,	but	they	deserve a	better	one	than	I	would	have	been,	and	I	look	forward	to	Jason	Scott’s upcoming	documentary	Get	Lamp	in	part	for	that	reason.	Resources	including The	Interactive	Fiction	Archive,	Baf’s	Guide,	ifMUD,	ifWiki,	rec.arts.int-fiction, and	the	Society	for	Promotion	of	Adventure	Games	newsletter	provide	a	wealth of	primary	source	material,	catalogs,	and	scholarship,	all	generously	shared	by their	maintainers,	and	these	forums	host	ongoing	conversation	on	IF	that	critical theory	has	in	some	ways	only	recently	begun	to	join. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Too	many	authors	of	IF	have	inspired	me	to	name	them	all	here,	and	too	many good	works	could	not	be	shoehorned	into	my	project,	even	in	gratuitous footnotes.	I’ll	confine	myself	to	thanking	Brian	Moriarty,	whose	early	works	first impressed	me	with	the	art	of	IF,	and	Emily	Short,	whose	contemporary	works are	both	truly	superlative	and	insufficiently	treated	in	this	study. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thanks	also	to	Will	Crowther	and	Don	Woods,	who	started	it	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p268"></a>A	dissertation	is	both	an	intellectual	and	an	emotional	undertaking.	Graduate school	sometimes	seemed	insuperable,	but	I	persevered	thanks	to	the	love, judicious	advice,	and	relentless	hazing	of	Tassie	Gniady,	Rob	Adlington,	Felix Klock,	and	Elizabeth	Freudenthal,	each	of	whom	deserves	their	own	complete essay	of	thanks.	The	UCSB	English	department	also	provided	a	nurturing	faculty and	cohort,	as	well	as	a	staff	without	whom	I	would	surely	never	have	navigated the	university	bureaucracy,	including	Laura	Baldwin,	Janet	Mallen,	Susan Gosling,	and	most	of	all	Lindsay	Cahn,	who	repeatedly	saved	me	from	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	couldn’t	carry	on,	my	family	carried	me.	My	parents	Paul	and Charlene	Douglass	supported	me	unconditionally	and	were	always	there	to listen;	my	sister	Regan	Douglass	mailed	care	packages.	My	spiritual	brother	and sister	helped	too:	when	I	was	high,	Daniel	Krause	brainstormed	with	me,	and when	I	was	low,	Karen	Lo	commiserated	and	got	me	back	on	my	feet.	All	of	my relatives	were	understanding	during	my	long	preoccupations	and	absences.	Of them	all,	this	study	is	dedicated	to	my	grandparents:	Charles	and	Norma	Keller and	Malcolm	and	Enid	Douglass.	Only	Enid	lived	to	see	it	completed,	but	all might	recognize	a	bit	of	themselves	in	it:	the	sweet	amalgam	of	technology, history,	humanities	and	arts	that	mixes	inside	a	child	who	has	played	between one	set	of	shelves	crammed	with	dusty	tomes	and	another	bursting	with technophilic	paraphernalia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	addition	to	the	consultations	of	my	committee,	I	received	crucial	feedback on	the	final	manuscript	from	Christy	Dena,	Tassie	Gniady,	Demian	Katz,	Jimmy Maher,	Nick	Montfort,	Jason	Scott,	and	Emily	Short. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	I’m	grateful	to	my	life	partner	and	friend	Holly	Rushing,	whose steady	editorial	hand	vetted	and	clarified	this	entire	work	to	its	great	benefit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Compared	to	meeting	her,	completing	a	seven-year	degree	seems	but	a	little thing. </p>
