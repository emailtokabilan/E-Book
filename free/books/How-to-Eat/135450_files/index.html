<p class="calibre1">—CORNARO</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p5"></a><b class="calibre3">THE	INTRODUCTION</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">This	author-physician's	cure	for	"nerves"	vividly	recalls	the	simplicity	of	method employed	in	the	complete	restoration	to	health	of	one	of	olden	time	whose	story has	come	ringing	down	the	ages	in	the	Book	of	Books.	Naaman,	captain	of	the host	of	the	king	of	Syria,	a	mighty	man	of	valor	and	honorable	in	the	sight	of	all men,	 turned	 away	 in	 a	 rage	 when	 Elisha,	 the	 prophet	 of	 the	 Most	 High, prescribed	 for	 his	 dread	 malady	 a	 remedy	 so	 simple	 that	 it	 was	 despised	 in	 his eyes.	 But	 "his	 servants	 came	 near	 and	 said	 ...	 'If	 the	 prophet	 had	 bid	 thee	 do some	great	thing,	wouldest	thou	not	have	done	it?'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	"How	to	Eat"	the	author	offers	the	sufferer	from	"nerves"	a	remedy	as	simple as	that	Elisha	offered	Naaman.	He	gives	him	an	opportunity	to	profit	by	his	well-tested	knowledge	that	overeating	and	 <i class="calibre4">rapidity</i>	in	eating	are	ruinous	to	health	and shorten	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 is	 seldom	 that	 there	 emanates	 from	 the	 pen	 of	 a	 doctor	 a	 book	 which, concerning	 any	 physical	 disorder,	 minimizes	 the	 efforts	 of	 the	 medical practitioner.	 While	 this	 author-physician	 gives	 full	 credit	 to	 the	 conscientious physician	 for	 the	 great	 service	 he	 is	 able	 to	 render	 in	 all	 other	 spheres	 of	 his profession,	he	wholly	denies	the	necessity	for	medical	care	in	cases	of	nervous breakdown,	and	discounts	liberally	the	benefits	to	be	derived	from	professional advice	except	in	so	far	as	the	doctor	is	the	patient's	counselor	and	dictator	as	to what	and	how	and	how	much	he	shall	eat	and	drink,	and	the	way	he	shall	employ his	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Any	 discourse	 is	 valuable	 which	 incites	 a	 man	 having	 a	 marked	 tendency	 to depressing,	morbid	ideas,	to	rid	himself	of	them.	Dr.	Hinkle	helps	the	sufferer	to gain	that	confidence	and	cheer	which	result	from	knowledge	of	certain	immunity from	dreaded	ills	and	positive	assurance	of	recovery	by	mere	regulation	of	food or	employment	along	the	lines	of	simple,	everyday	living. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	that	alone	is	not	sufficient.	It	is	made	quite	clear	that	no	one	thing	by	itself will	 insure	 a	 cure	 of	 "nerves."	 The	 cure	 must	 come	 through	 common	 sense exerted	 along	 several	 related	 avenues	 of	 endeavor.	 No	 matter	 how	 steadfastly one	 may	 adhere	 to	 directions	 as	 to	 abstaining	 from	 harmful	 food	 and	 injurious methods	of	partaking	of	those	foods	which	are	beneficial,	if	he	spends	the	larger</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p6"></a>portion	of	his	time	idly	rocking	in	a	convenient	arm	chair,	exerting	neither	body nor	 mind	 nor	 will,	 that	 which	 might	 be	 gained	 by	 proper	 nutrition	 is	 largely nullified	by	lack	of	physical	exercise	and	mental	activity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 this	 little	 book	 may	 serve	 as	 a	 spur	 to	 the	 bodily	 self-denial	 and	 self-repression	 and	 the	 intellectual	 and	 spiritual	 uplift	 which	 make	 for	 character-building,	 is	 the	 very	 evident	 goal	 of	 its	 writer.	 From	 self-analysis	 and	 self-cure he	has	worked	out	a	philosophy—a	system	or	 <i class="calibre4">art</i>—by	which	those	afflicted	with nervous	 breakdown	 may	 be	 healed.	 And	 by	 putting	 into	 print	 the	 result	 of	 his practical	 experiments	 in	 diet	 and	 exercise	 he	 has	 broadened	 immeasurably	 the scope	of	his	helpfulness	to	all	nervebound	sufferers	by	placing	within	their	reach the	 simplest	 of	 measures	 by	 which	 release	 is	 secured	 from	 a	 condition	 which wholly	incapacitates	for	active	service	or	even	for	quiet,	everyday	usefulness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	because	the	things	Dr.	Hinkle	advises	are	so	commonplace,	and	because	the doing	of	them	day	after	day,	year	in	and	year	out,	is	so	monotonous,	that	people will	 be	 tempted	 to	 disregard	 or	 make	 light	 of	 their	 helpfulness.	 But	 the commonplace	 things	 which	 make	 up	 life	 are	 all	 important,	 as	 Susan	 Coolidge has	 so	 aptly	 expressed	 in	 these	 lines	 which	 fittingly	 illustrate	 the	 author's thought:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	commonplace	sun	in	the	commonplace	sky</p>
<p class="calibre1">Makes	up	the	commonplace	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	moon	and	the	stars	are	commonplace	things, </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	the	flower	that	blooms	and	the	bird	that	sings; </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	dark	were	the	world,	and	sad	our	lot</p>
<p class="calibre1">If	the	flowers	failed,	and	the	sun	shone	not; </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	God,	who	studies	each	separate	soul, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Out	of	commonplace	lives	makes	his	beautiful	whole." </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 therefore	 behooves	 the	 sufferer	 from	 "nerves"	 and	 that	 great	 host	 of	 others who	 are	 in	 danger	 of	 a	 nervous	 breakdown	 if	 they	 do	 not	 speedily	 mend	 their ways	 of	 eating	 and	 living,	 to	 heed	 the	 kindly	 admonitions	 and	 follow	 the precepts	 of	 this	 author	 who	 practices	 what	 he	 preaches.	 By	 persistently	 doing commonplace	 things	 in	 the	 most	 commonplace	 way,	 keeping	 ever	 in	 mind	 the great	 objects	 to	 be	 attained	 thereby—good	 health,	 good	 cheer,	 and	 increased usefulness	 throughout	 a	 long	 life—the	 reader	 of	 this	 little	 treatise	 will	 find	 it worth	 many,	 many	 times	 its	 size,	 weight,	 and	 bulk.	 And	 heeding	 the	 author's admonition,	 "Go	 thou	 and	 do	 likewise,"	 he	 will	 not	 shorten	 his	 life	 or	 lose	 it altogether	 in	 fruitless	 quests	 for	 the	 strength	 and	 nerve	 vigor	 which	 constantly</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a>elude	him	because	of	lack	of	self-control	and	failure	to	persist	in	the	simple	but efficacious	measures	of	relief	here	outlined. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">I.	WHERE	THE	TROUBLE	LIES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	now	over	twenty	years	since	I	had	my	first	nervous	breakdown.	About	ten years	later	I	had	another,	far	worse	than	the	first	one.	The	first	lasted	six	months; the	second	a	little	more	than	two	and	one	half	years.	Doubtless	if	I	had	not	in	the strangest	 way	 in	 the	 world	 found	 out	 how	 to	 cure	 myself	 it	 would	 have	 lasted until	now,	unless	death	in	the	meantime	had	come	to	my	relief.	But	right	here	I want	 to	 say	 that	 if	 you	 are	 looking	 for	 some	 new	 or	 miraculous	 treatment	 for such	unfortunate	people	you	might	as	well	close	the	book	now,	for	you	will	be disappointed.	There	is	a	cure	for	"nerves"	but	the	cure	is	as	old	as	the	world.	The trouble	 with	 poor	 deluded	 mortals—doctors	 included—is,	 we	 are	 constantly looking	for	a	miracle	to	cure	us,	but	if	we	look	back	on	all	the	real	cures	that	we have	ever	heard	about,	we	shall	find	they	were	as	simple	as	the	sun	or	the	rain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	in	the	name	of	common	sense	let	me	ask:	what	is	the	difference	 <i class="calibre4">how</i>	we	are cured	 if	 we	  <i class="calibre4">are</i>	 cured	 and	 are	  <i class="calibre4">happy</i>	 as	 a	 result	 of	 it?	 Isn't	 that	 enough?	 Most certainly	it	is. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 now,	 as	 we	 journey	 along	 through	 the	 pages	 of	 this	 book,	 I	 want	 you	 to know	 that	 these	 words	 have	 been	 written	 by	 one	 who	 has	 nothing	 to	 offer	 you except	human	experience.	As	we	proceed	you	will	notice	that	every	statement	is tremendously	positive.	When	a	man	has	been	through	this	literal	hell	of	"nerves" </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 knows	 all	 about	 it	 and	 what	 can	 be	 done	 for	 it.	 And	 so	 when	 I	 tell	 you	 the things	 you	 must	 do	 to	 get	 well	 and	  <i class="calibre4">stay	 well</i>,	 I	 want	 you	 to	 understand	 that	 I know.	There	is	absolutely	no	theory	to	be	found	in	these	pages.	If	you	put	your finger	in	the	fire	you	burn	it.	You	don't	have	to	take	your	finger	out	of	the	fire, call	 in	 a	 lot	 of	 learned	 gentlemen	 and	 say	 to	 them:	 "Now	 tell	 me	 your	 candid opinion	about	my	finger.	Is	it	burned	or	is	it	not?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 I	 am	 just	 as	 positive	 about	 my	 cure	 of	 "nerves"	 as	 you	 could	 be	 that	 fire burned	your	finger.	That	brings	me	to	what	I	want	to	say	about	the	so-called	"rest cures"	 at	 the	 sanitariums.	 It	 is	 a	 well-known	 fact	 that	 if	 a	 case	 of	 "nerves"	 is pronounced	 cured	 at	 a	 sanitarium	 the	 cure	 is	 only	 temporary.	 Sooner	 or	 later</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>every	one	of	these	patients	goes	down	hill	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 remember	 I	 am	 talking	 about	 people	 who	 have	 nervous	 breakdowns THROUGH	 NO	 FAULT	 OF	 THEIR	 OWN.	 I	 have	 no	 time	 to	 spare	 for	 the person	 who	 has	 brought	 on	 his	 own	 trouble.	 I	 am	 chiefly	 concerned	 with	 that host	 of	 children	 in	 America—and	 there	 is	 a	 host,	 I	 am	 sorry	 to	 say—born	 of what	I	choose	to	call	"pre-nervous"	parents.	The	girls	of	such	parents	frequently break	 down	 in	 high	 school.	 And	 many	 of	 the	 finest	 boys	 that	 I	 know	 have	 this dreadful	 "thing"	 fastened	 firmly	 upon	 them	 just	 at	 the	 very	 beginning	 of	 their lifework. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	may	think	I	am	a	little	vehement,	but	to	me	one	of	the	most	damnable	and disgusting	things	in	the	world	is	that	the	medical	profession	remains	so	ignorant concerning	the	 <i class="calibre4">real	cure</i>	for	such	cases.	I	believe	the	late	Sir	William	Osler	was the	greatest	physician	of	his	generation.	He	was	not	only	a	man	of	talent,	he	was a	genius,	and	his	knowledge	of	medicine	almost	passes	understanding.	Yet	Osler himself	 was	 as	 much	 in	 the	 dark	 concerning	 the	  <i class="calibre4">real</i>	 cure	 for	 so-called <i class="calibre4">neurasthenia</i>	as	the	physicians	who	read	his	works	on	practice.	If	one	wants	to find	out	how	ignorant	the	whole	profession	is	on	the	subject	of	a	permanent	cure, let	the	thing	get	hold	of	him,	and	then	let	him	make	the	rounds	of	the	physicians, follow	out	their	advice,	and	see	where	he	comes	out! </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	have	said	that	even	the	sanitariums	of	this	country—and	for	that	matter	I	might have	 said	 of	 any	 other	 country—do	 not	  <i class="calibre4">permanently	 cure</i>	 these	 people.	 I	 have ample	proof	of	this	statement.	I	have	met	these	people	everywhere	and	no	doubt you	 have,	 too.	 Quite	 recently	 the	 subject	 was	 brought	 up	 anew	 to	 me.	 I	 had written	an	article	on	the	subject	for	one	of	the	magazines,	a	magazine	having	a large	circulation.	In	a	very	short	time	my	mail	was	literally	flooded	with	letters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every	 incoming	 mail	 brought	 great	 numbers	 of	 them.	 They	 came	 from physicians	of	the	regular	school,	and	from	physicians	of	many	other	schools,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 won't	 mention	 any	 of	 them,	 for	 this	 is	 a	 treatise	 on	 a	 dreadful	 affliction	 and how	one	may	get	rid	of	it;	it	is	not	intended	as	a	criticism	of	anyone.	I	have	no desire	to	criticize	and	I	haven't	time.	I	am	stating	facts	interwoven	with	my	own life.	If	the	cure	is	real,	the	people	will	find	it	out	after	they	have	tried	it;	if	it	is not,	 they	 will	 also	 find	 that	 out.	 In	 fact,	 it's	 exactly	 as	 Gamaliel,	 the	 teacher	 of Paul,	 said	 to	 the	 men	 of	 Israel	 when	 they	 would	 have	 slain	 the	 apostles	 for teaching	Christ's	sayings,	"Refrain	from	these	men	and	let	them	alone:	for	if	this counsel	 or	 this	 work	 be	 of	 men,	 it	 will	 come	 to	 naught:	 but	 if	 it	 be	 of	 God,	 ye cannot	 overthrow	 it."	 And	 it's	 exactly	 the	 same	 way	 with	 this	 healing	 art.	 The very	 fact	 that	 physicians	 of	 all	 schools	 of	 medicine—physicians	 who	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>sufferers	 from	 "nerves"—wrote	 me,	 shows	 plainly	 that	 they	 could	 not	 heal themselves.	 I	 have	 many	 letters	 from	 people	 who	 have	 been	 in	 sanitariums	 for years	and	who	still	have	"nerves."	The	sanitariums	do	some	people	a	lot	of	good, but	they	cannot	remove	the	 <i class="calibre4">cause</i>	of	nervousness.	I	am	certain	that	the	very	best rest	cure	for	women	is	the	one	Dr.	Weir	Mitchell	first	used.	But	such	women	are sure	to	go	down	again	and	again	and	still	again	if	that	is	 <i class="calibre4">all</i>	that	is	done	for	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	 frankly,	 if	 Christian	 Science	 could	 cure	 such	 cases	 and	 make	 them	  <i class="calibre4">stay</i> cured	 I	 should	 want	 a	 practitioner	 of	 this	 cult	 to	 treat	 them.	 But	 Christian Science	simply	cannot	cure	them	because	the	underlying	cause	of	this	trouble	is <i class="calibre4">physical</i>,	not	 <i class="calibre4">mental</i>.	In	other	 words,	the	mind	 becomes	ill	because	 the	body	is made	ill	by	certain	poisons,	and	the	nature	of	the	disease	is	so	peculiar	that	most of	 these	 miserable	 sufferers	 will	 not	 even	 try	 a	 thing	 unless	 some	 one	 brings them	overwhelming	evidence	of	its	having	wrought	a	cure.	Or,	if	they	do	try	it, they	usually	quit	the	treatment	before	nature	has	had	time	to	do	her	work	and	set their	bodies	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	have	the	most	profound	sympathy	for	such	people.	I	want	to	speak	directly	to them.	That	is	the	task	that	I	have	set	myself	in	this	work.	I	want	to	talk	directly to	those	of	you	who	are	sufferers	from	"nerves."	I	see	you	in	every	state,	in	every city,	in	every	village,	and	throughout	the	farming	districts	of	this	country.	I	have received	letters	from	many	farmers	who	are	suffering	with	this	"thing."	To	them let	me	say,	I	know	just	how	you	feel,	and	from	the	very	bottom	of	my	heart	I	pity you.	 I	 know	 the	 horrible	 suffering	 of	 each	 one	 of	 you.	 I	 don't	 care	 what	 your ambition	has	been	or	is.	I	don't	care	what	your	situation	in	life	may	be.	I	don't care	how	rich	or	how	poor	you	are.	I	don't	care	how	much	trouble	you	have	had, or	the	nature	of	it.	I	want	you	to	know	these	words	are	being	written	by	one	who knows	more	about	your	sufferings	than	you	can	imagine.	I	want	you	to	believe this,	because	it	is	true.	If	you	have	longed	and	prayed	for	death,	remember	that the	one	who	is	writing	these	words	also	has	longed	and	prayed	for	death.	But	one thing	you	must	be	sure	to	remember:	while	you	are	waiting	and	trying	to	get	well you	must	have	 <i class="calibre4">patience</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	recollect	one	beautiful	day	in	early	spring	when	traveling	in	Nebraska	I	passed a	 little	 cemetery.	 How	 sweet	 and	 restful	 the	 place	 seemed,	 and	 as	 I	 looked	 out over	those	little	white	stones	I	prayed	silently	that	the	great	God	who	made	me would	not	hold	me	much	longer	on	earth,	that	He	would	soon	grant	me	the	rest and	 peace	 which	 I	 believed	 was	 to	 be	 found	 only	 in	 death	 and	 the	 grave.	 But <i class="calibre4">remember	this</i>:	In	those	dark	days	never	for	a	moment	did	I	think	of	taking	my own	life!	These	words	may	reach	some	one	who	has	had	such	a	thought.	If	so,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>say	to	you	that	to	take	one's	life	is	the	most	cowardly	thing	a	human	being	can do.	This	is	the	only	place	where	I	feel	like	being	severe	with	you	people.	Shame on	 the	 man	 or	 woman	 who	 will	 not	 go	 on	 to	 the	 end	 fighting	 honorably!	 And now	 if	 you	 have	 ever	 given	 thought	 to	 such	 a	 thing,	 blot	 it	 from	 your	 mind forever.	I	can	see	how	these	miserable	people	might	long	for	death,	as	I	did.	But no	matter	how	we	may	long	for	release	through	death,	the	God	of	nature	must	be the	judge	of	our	time	of	going. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	 this	 brings	 me	 to	 what	 I	 want	 to	 say	 about	 such	 sufferers	 going	 insane. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Believe	 me,	 they	 never	 do!	 Remember	 this	 always.	 You	 won't	 become	 insane. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	couldn't	if	you	tried!	In	letter	after	letter	among	the	flood	of	them	I	have	had from	all	over	this	country	and	Canada,	I	read	how	the	poor	sufferer	feared	he	or she	might	be	going	insane.	I	know,	poor	souls,	just	how	you	feel.	That	feeling	is, I	think,	the	most	dreadful	of	all	things	connected	with	"nerves."	I	suffered	from	it for	years.	It	is	a	dreadful	feeling,	but	there	is	not	the	least	bit	of	danger	of	such	a thing	 happening	 to	 you.	 You	 will	  <i class="calibre4">not</i>	 go	 insane.	 Such	 persons	 can't.	 Do	 you really	get	me?	Such	persons	cannot	go	insane.	This	disease	is	nothing	but	what we	call	a	functional	nervous	trouble.	And	so	forget	about	the	danger	of	insanity for	all	time.	You	can	be	cured,	but	you	will	make	your	return	to	health	just	that much	slower	by	harboring	this	fear.	And	it	would	be	simply	foolish	for	you	to	go on	thinking	it	possible	after	I—let	me	say	it	again—after	I	have	told	you	that	it cannot	happen.	For	the	value	of	this	treatise	lies	in	the	"I."	Its	value	is	just	like that	of	the	treatise	by	Cornaro.	He	lived	it.	And	so	likewise	have	I	lived	it.	I	have been	 laid	 low	 with	 this	 malady.	 I	 have	 staggered	 in	 black	 despair	 with	 staring eyes	 and	 bleeding	 feet	 and	 crying	 soul	 along	 this	 road	 strewn	 with	 thorns	 and stones.	I	know	what	it	is	to	lie	awake	all	night	and	cry	like	a	baby,	with	none	to know	 and	 none	 to	 tell	 me	 what	 to	 do.	 I	 know	 what	 it	 is	 to	 be	 tremendously ambitious.	 Ambition!	 Ambition!	 Ah,	 God	 of	 Heaven!	 How	 a	 poor	 soul	 suffers who	beyond	everything	else,	craves	to	be	able	to	do	something	big	in	this	world because	he	knows	he	should,	yet	is	held	down	by	this	dreadful	thing,	"nerves!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	how	little,	how	unspeakably	little,	do	physicians,	even	the	greatest	of	them, know,	 actually	 know,	 how	 we	 suffer,	 unless	 indeed	 there	 be	 one	 in	 whose	 own body	the	fiend	has	sunk	deep	its	talons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	I	had	my	first	breakdown	I	made	up	my	mind	to	study	medicine	because</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	told	me	that	I	was	one	of	those	"peculiar"	people	who	just	 <i class="calibre4">think</i>	there is	something	the	matter	with	them.	Is	it	not	strange	that	with	all	the	advance	that has	been	made	in	general	medicine,	little	or	nothing	has	been	done	for	the	relief of	the	people	born	with	this	curse	hanging	over	them? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>I	wish	this	book	could	be	put	into	the	hands	of	every	nervous	parent	for,	think	as you	may,	all	nervous	parents	beget	nervous	children.	But	does	it	follow	that	such children	 should	 have	 a	 nervous	 breakdown	 almost	 before	 they	 are	 out	 of	 their teens?	No,	decidedly	not;	and	what	is	more,	they	never	should	and	never	would break	down,	if	they	had	proper	food. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 look	 back	 with	 horror	 on	 the	 many	 nights	 of	 my	 childhood	 when	 I	 suffered with	 "night	 terrors."	 And	 right	 here	 let	 me	 say:	 no	 child	 will	  <i class="calibre4">ever	 have	 night</i> <i class="calibre4">terrors</i>	if	he	is	given	just	what	he	should	eat,	and	is	kept	from	overeating.	And now	a	few	words	about	the	 <i class="calibre4">first</i>	great	point	concerning	the	prevention	as	well	as the	cure	of	"nerves." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nervous	people,	and	many	others	as	well,	eat	too	much.	That,	you	say,	is	nothing new.	But	that	is	just	where	the	dreadful	wrong	begins;	and	why	there	has	been tragedy	 after	 tragedy,	 and	 why	 even	 while	 this	 is	 being	 written	 there	 will	 be many	more	tragedies.	You	will	hear	lecturers	say—I	myself	have	said	it,	and	to large	audiences:	"You	people	eat	too	much."	But	if	that's	all	that	is	said,	people straightway	 go	 away	 and	 say:	 "Oh,	 yes,	 he's	 right,	 of	 course.	 We	 all	 eat	 too much."	 And	 there	 it	 ends.	 Until	 recently	 people	 did	 not	 know—most	 of	 them don't	 know	 yet—that	 each	 day	 they	 are	 actually	 bringing	 the	 grave	 nearer	 by overeating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	 long	 ago	 the	 great	 life	 insurance	 companies	 of	 this	 country	 held	 a	 notable convention	 in	 the	 city	 of	 New	 York.	 Now	 after	 everything	 had	 been	 said	 and done,	 after	 every	 phase	 of	 life	 insurance	 had	 been	 discussed,	 what	 do	 you suppose	was	the	great	outstanding	statement	from	that	remarkable	body	of	men who	know	more	about	why	people	die	than	any	other	body	of	people	on	earth?	It was	this:	"The	average	American	 <i class="calibre4">man	or	woman</i>	dies	at	the	age	of	43	because	he eats	what	he	wants	to	eat	rather	than	what	he	should	eat."	That	means,	of	course, that	practically	all	Americans	overeat.	They	are	all	like	the	child	who	says,	"I'm not	 hungry	 for	 bread	 and	 butter.	 I'm	 hungry	 for	 cake."	 And	 I	 find	 that	 most	 of these	 poor	 deluded	 nervous	 sufferers	 eat	 what	 they	 want	 under	 the	 supposition that	it	is	good	for	them	because	they	crave	it.	I	myself	used	to	do	so.	I	would	eat candy	 by	 the	 pound.	 And	 it	 is	 odd	 but	 quite	 true	 that	 nervous	 people	 crave	 the very	things	that	hurt	them	most.	But	there	is	no	more	sense	in	eating	what	you crave	because	you	crave	it	than	there	is	in	the	man	who	is	addicted	to	alcohol, drinking	alcohol	because	he	craves	it.	I	once	used	tobacco;	I	craved	it,	but	I	did not	need	it	just	because	I	craved	it.	It	is	true	the	body	naturally	needs	some	fats, some	carbohydrates;	in	fact,	a	balanced	ration,	as	we	shall	see	later.	But	I	want	to make	 it	 mighty	 plain	 here	 that	 never	 was	 there	 a	 greater	 error	 than	 that	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>supposing	you	need	chocolates	or	sweets	just	because	you	crave	them.	And	you don't	need	to	overeat,	and	keep	on	doing	it,	just	because	you	must	eat. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">II.	HOW	TO	OVERCOME	THE	TROUBLE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">We	have	now	come	to	the	second	step	in	the	cure	of	"nerves"—eating	the	right food	 in	 the	 right	 way.	 You	 must	 chew	 all	 food	 until	 it	 is	 of	 the	 consistency	 of cream,	 and	 you	 must	 also	 sip	 all	 liquids	 slowly.	 And	 now,	 as	 you	 read	 these things	that	I	have	set	down,	I	want	you	to	remember	this:	doing	any	one	thing—</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 doing	 that	 alone—will	 not	 cure	 this	 malady.	 No,	 it	 is	 doing	 a	 number	 of things	at	the	right	time.	I	know	this	is	true	because	I	have	tried	it.	For	a	time	I chewed	my	food	to	a	cream,	but	that	was	the	only	thing	I	did	in	an	endeavor	to get	well.	I	was	doing	none	of	the	other	things	that	are	absolutely	necessary	for	a cure.	This	is	one	great	trouble	with	all	such	people.	They	will	Fletcherize	for	a time	and	then	say	there	is	nothing	to	that	because	it	does	not	cure	them.	Well,	as I've	 said,	 that	 alone	 will	 not,	 and	 I	 want	 to	 dwell	 at	 length	 on	 this	 because nobody	knows	as	well	as	I	do,	what	harm	such	a	belief	does	the	nervous	sufferer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trying	 out	 Fletcherizing	 alone,	 which	 I	 say	 must	 be	 done	 together	 with	 other things	if	you	want	to	get	well	and	stay	well,	is	like	taking	the	handle	of	an	axe and	 going	 out	 into	 the	 woods	 to	 cut	 down	 a	 tree.	 Now	 with	 Fletcherizing	 you have	 a	 perfectly	 good	 handle,	 but	 you	 know	 very	 well	 that	 you	 can't	 cut	 a	 tree down	with	only	an	axe	handle.	But	that	is	not	the	fault	of	the	handle.	The	fault	is obviously	your	own.	Now	suppose	you	get	the	axe	and	fit	the	handle	to	it.	You</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>can	then	cut	the	tree	down	if	you	work	hard	enough	at	the	task.	Again,	suppose you	cut	the	tree	half	way	through	and	quit.	Will	the	axe	keep	on	until	the	work	is done?	You	know	it	will	not,	and	you	very	well	know	if	you	wish	to	be	cured	you must	keep	on	doing	your	part	of	the	work	or	dieting	will	be	of	no	value	whatever to	you.	Now	suppose	a	man	comes	along	and	tells	you	that	the	axe	you	have	is no	 good	 and	 therefore	 it	 is	 no	 use	 for	 you	 to	 keep	 on	 trying	 to	 use	 it.	 That	 is exactly	what	some	physicians	still	say	about	Fletcherizing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	you	say,	"I	must	cut	this	tree	down.	Nobody	will	do	it	for	me;	how	shall	I	get it	down?	Can	you	give	me	an	axe	that	will	cut	it	down?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	no,"	he	replies,	"but	anyway	there's	no	use	fooling	with	that	one." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	 if	 you	 are	 determined	 to	 do	 the	 work,	 you	 say,	 "I	 have	 to	 cut	 the	 tree down.	 You	 have	 no	 other	 axe	 to	 offer	 me,	 so	 I'm	 going	 to	 try	 the	 one	 I	 have." </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 you	 go	 ahead	 and	 cut	 down	 the	 tree.	 Then	 just	 as	 you	 have	 finished,	 the man	comes	your	way	again,	and	in	great	delight	you	call	out	to	him:	"Come	and see!	I	cut	this	tree	down	with	the	axe	you	said	was	no	good!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	comes	over	to	you	and	says,	"Where's	the	tree?	I	don't	see	it!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	 are	 astonished	 and	 you	 tell	 him,	 "There	 it	 lies	 on	 the	 ground	 right	 before your	eyes!	Can't	you	see	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 he	 turns	 and	 walks	 away	 saying:	 "There	 is	 no	 tree	 there;	 it	 is	 all	 in	 your mind." </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 is	 exactly	 what	 people	 with	 "nerves"	 have	 been	 told	 again	 and	 again	 by physicians,	by	relatives,	and	by	most	other	people	who	have	never	had	"nerves." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 tell	 you	 these	 things	 so	 that	 when	 you	 begin	 to	 eat	 sparingly	 and	 chew	 your food	 to	 a	 cream	 you	 may	 fortify	 yourself	 against	 well-meaning	 but	 mistaken friends	 and	 relatives.	 And,	 oddly	 enough,	 it	 does	 seem	 that	 the	 individual	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">"nerves"	has	more	friends	and	relatives	than	any	other	person	in	the	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Remember	 you	 must	 not	 only	 chew	 your	 food	 to	 the	 consistency	 of	 cream	 for one	or	two	months,	you	must	make	this	practice	a	lifelong	habit.	If	you	cannot take	time	to	eat	a	meal	in	this	way,	you	had	much	better	go	hungry.	To	people who	 travel	 and	 must	 frequently	 take	 their	 meals	 in	 railroad	 eating	 houses,	 I would	say,	get	some	bread	and	butter	sandwiches	and	eat	them	slowly	while	on the	train.	There	is	always	a	chance	to	secure	all	you	need	to	eat,	too.	You	may not	always	be	able	to	sit	an	hour	at	the	table—the	time	we	should	give	to	a	meal</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>if	we	eat	as	we	should.	I	know	many	object	to	this	rule	on	the	ground	that	if	we followed	 it	 we	 should	 get	 nothing	 else	 done.	 But	 that	 is	 nonsense.	 Did	 not	 the Master	of	us	all	say,	"Are	there	not	twelve	hours	in	the	day?"	Then	can	we	not devote	three	of	the	twelve	to	our	food?	If	we	have	nine	hours	in	which	we	are	at our	highest	efficiency,	is	it	not	good	sense,	if	we	eat	three	meals	a	day,	to	give three	 hours	 to	 these	 meals?	 There	 is	 only	 one	 sane	 answer	 to	 the	 question;	 we should	take	an	hour	for	a	meal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every	now	and	then	some	magazine	writer	will	state	that	the	chewing	of	food	to a	cream	does	not	help	anybody.	He	will	tell	you	that	you	can	swallow	your	food any	old	way	and	it	will	not	hurt	you	in	the	least.	In	fact,	I	actually	saw	an	article in	 one	 of	 our	 leading	 periodicals	 containing	 just	 such	 statements.	 We	 should,	 I suppose,	 have	 only	 pity	 for	 an	 editor	 who	 would	 give	 space	 to	 such	 stuff,	 and should	also	pity	the	poor	wretch	who	by	writing	it	is	striving	to	attain	notoriety. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	any	rate	there	is	one	excellent	thing	about	such	lies,	they	do	harm	for	only	a little	while.	When	people	find	out	that	a	thing	is	harmful	to	them,	they	usually quit	it,	no	matter	how	many	notoriety	seekers	are	urging	and	encouraging	them to	keep	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Usually	the	sufferer	with	"nerves"	is	the	only	one	in	the	household	who	will	eat sparingly	 and	 chew	 his	 food	 slowly.	 But	 now	 and	 then	 I	 find	 an	 intelligent, sympathetic	 man	 who	 will	 do	 so	 because	 it	 is	 helpful	 to	 his	 wife.	 He sympathizes	 with	 her	 infirmity,	 and	 with	 fine	 self-denial	 eats	 as	 she	 does.	 And note	this:	he	usually	derives	benefit	from	so	doing.	Time	after	time	when	I	have put	 a	 nervous	 woman	 under	 this	 regimen,	 and	 then	 her	 husband	 elected	 to	 go along	with	her,	I	have	had	the	man	come	to	me	and	say:	"Well,	doctor,	I	declare I'm	 feeling	 a	 whole	 lot	 better	 myself!	 I	 don't	 get	 sleepy	 any	 more	 during	 the daytime,	and	that	pain	I	used	to	have	in	the	region	of	my	liver	is	gone!"	And	so on	and	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fact	is	just	this:	anybody	who	follows	the	rules	that	I	learned	to	apply	in	my own	case	cannot	fail	to	be	benefited.	And	although	those	not	inclined	to	"nerves" </p>
<p class="calibre1">can	eat	a	greater	variety	of	food,	it's	greatly	to	be	desired	when	there	is	a	nervous person	 in	 a	 household	 of	 grownups	 that	 all	 other	 members	 of	 the	 family	 enter together	into	this	thing.	It	could	not	fail	to	help	every	one	of	them.	To	be	truthful, in	 the	 beginning	 you	 will	 all	 find	 it	 mighty	 hard	 to	 persist	 in	 chewing	 all	 your food	to	a	cream.	Mouthful	after	mouthful	of	food	will	get	away	from	you	when you	are	not	thinking.	This	just	goes	to	show	how	we	are	in	the	habit	of	bolting our	 food.	 At	 first	 people	 who	 Fletcherize	 or	 chew	 their	 food	 perfectly,	 usually lose	weight.	I	most	certainly	did.	I	lost	about	twenty	pounds	because	of	it,	but	I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>was	so	well	and	felt	so	good	I	could	almost	have	jumped	over	the	North	Star. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 know	 that,	 unfortunately,	 a	 lot	 of	 people	 with	 "nerves"	 have	 started	 to	 chew their	 food	 carefully	 and	 to	 eat	 sparingly,	 but	 the	 minute	 they	 found	 themselves losing	weight	they	were	frightened	and	quit.	They	went	on	carrying	that	ten	 or twenty	 or	 thirty	 pounds	 of	 flesh	 and	 all	 the	 time	 suffering	 the	 tortures	 of	 the damned	 just	 in	 order	 that	 they	 might	 keep	 it.	 But	 of	 what	 benefit	 are	 a	 certain number	 of	 extra	 pounds	 of	 flesh	 and	 how	 can	 a	 man	 explain	 such	 a	 senseless action? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	astonishing	thing	is	that	many	physicians	are	willing	to	condemn	a	cure	just as	soon	as	they	find	the	patient	has	lost	a	pound	of	beef.	But	as	I	said	before,	the primary	mission	of	man	in	this	world	is	not	to	raise	beef.	I	do	not	find	fault	with the	raising	of	beef	in	the	feeding	yards,	but	if	beef	must	be	raised	let	us	confine the	industry	to	the	cattle	pens	and	stock	yards.	Let	us	not	worship	it	to	the	degree that	we	would	rather	live	in	hell	than	part	with	a	few	extra	pounds	that	overload our	own	bodies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	just	here	I	want	it	distinctly	understood,	as	I	have	said	before,	that	this	text is	primarily	for	 <i class="calibre4">functional	nervous	cases</i>.	Tubercular	people	belong	to	an	entirely different	 class.	 They	 should	 live	 out	 of	 doors	 day	 and	 night	 and	 should,	 if possible,	 be	 treated	 at	 outdoor	 institutions	 established	 for	 such	 cases.	 But	 the individual	with	"nerves"	will	find	what	he	needs	and	will	find	it	abundantly	if	he has	enough	determination	to	take	hold	of	it	and	keep	at	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 the	 part	 of	 many	 it	 will	 take	 all	 the	 determination	 they	 have	 to	 chew	 their food	to	a	cream	and	always	eat	sparingly.	In	regard	to	the	amount	of	food	taken, judgment	must	of	course	be	used.	We	all	know	that	it	is	possible	to	eat	too	little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 you	 should	 always	 quit	 eating	 while	 you	 still	 feel	 you	 would	 like	 a	 little more.	I	know	of	no	better	guide	than	this	to	offer	you.	But	I	have	observed	that the	 person	 who	 eats	 slowly	 and	 chews	 his	 food	 to	 a	 cream	 never	 eats	 as	 much food	as	he	would	if	he	bolted	it.	It	is	just	like	letting	a	thirsty	horse	drink	water.	I remember,	as	a	boy	on	the	farm,	when	I	led	a	very	thirsty	horse	from	the	field	to the	water	tank	how	rapidly	he	would	swallow.	If	my	father	were	with	me,	after the	 horse	 had	 drunk	 a	 while	 he	 would	 say,	 "Make	 him	 hold	 his	 head	 up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Frequently	when	I	did	so	the	horse	would	draw	a	long	breath	and	drink	no	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had	he	gone	right	on	drinking,	as	a	thirsty	horse	will	if	you	permit	him	to	do	so, he	 might	 have	 drunk	 twice	 as	 much	 as	 was	 good	 for	 him.	 And	 that's	 the	 way people	 eat.	 As	 a	 result	 the	 horse	 that	 drinks	 and	 drinks	 and	 drinks	 when	 he	 is very	thirsty	sometimes	dies	in	a	few	hours.	I	have	seen	a	horse	die	from	drinking</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>too	 much	 water	 and	 I	 have	 also	 seen	 people	 die	 in	 a	 few	 hours	 after	 a	 terrible gorge	that	they	could	not	get	rid	of.	Do	you	know	that	most	nervous	people	have a	way	of	sitting	down	to	the	table	and	eating	until	they	are	literally	full?	If	you could	 take	 out	 the	 stomach	 of	 such	 a	 person	 and	 look	 at	 it,	 the	 sight	 would frighten	you.	And	with	good	reason.	For	as	a	result	of	this	habit	many	nervous people	 have	 dilated	 stomachs.	 But	 if	 they	 would	 correct	 their	 manner	 of	 eating there	is	usually	enough	tone	in	the	muscular	walls	of	the	stomach	to	get	it	back to	 normal.	 I	 marvel	 again	 and	 again	 over	 how	 miraculously	 nature	 restores herself	even	after	she	has	been	terribly	abused,	if	only	she	is	given	a	chance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 am	 certain	 that	 all	 human	 beings	 would	 be	 more	 efficient	 if	 they	 chewed	 all solid	food	to	a	cream	and	sipped	all	liquids	slowly.	The	late	Professor	William James,	the	great	Harvard	psychologist,	testified	to	the	value	of	such	a	habit,	as did	 a	 number	 of	 other	 distinguished	 Harvard	 professors.	 I	 regret	 that	 some physicians	still	hold	out	in	their	belief	that	it	does	no	good	although	the	evidence stands	out	as	clearly	before	them	as	a	tree	along	the	roadside.	But	they	are	like the	 physician	 who	 some	 years	 ago	 declared	 that	 bathing	 was	 bad	 for	 people.	 I recall	how	hard	we	all	bore	down	upon	him,	as	he	richly	deserved,	and	how	the Journal	 of	 the	 American	 Medical	 Association	 printed	 a	 short	 poem	 ridiculing him.	I	am	quite	certain	that	the	members	of	the	Regular	school	of	medicine	have progressed	infinitely	farther	toward	the	cure	of	diseases	than	members	of	all	the other	 schools	 combined.	 I	 do	 not	 say	 this	 simply	 because	 I	 happen	 to	 be	 a physician	 of	 the	 Regular	 school;	 I	 say	 it	 because	 a	 candid	 survey	 of	 what	 has been	accomplished,	and	by	whom,	proves	it.	But	as	to	diet,	we	have	done	little compared	with	what	we	should	do.	We	have	made	no	greater	progress	along	this line	 because	 so	 many	 of	 us	 have	 been	 blinded	 by	 prejudice—the	 curse	 of	 the human	race. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 regard	 to	 chewing	 all	 food	 to	 a	 cream,	 most	 modern	 writers	 on	 dietetics, while	acknowledging	that	this	super-mastication	is	useful,	maintain	that	it	does not	increase	the	value	of	the	food.	But	they	err	greatly	in	this,	as	we	can	prove	in a	 very	 few	 words:	 If	 a	 certain	 amount	 of	 proteins,	 fats,	 and	 carbohydrates	 is bolted	 by	 a	 nervous	 man	 suffering	 from	 a	 breakdown,	 it	 will	 cause	 intestinal toxemia	as	a	result	of	the	bolted	food,	but	if	he	chews	the	food	to	a	cream	it	will be	 digested	 in	 a	 normal	 manner	 and	 will	 not	 cause	 gas	 in	 the	 stomach	 or intestines.	 The	 proper	 amount	 of	 food	 is	 absorbed	 and	 nourishes	 the	 man	 as	 it should.	Now	did	not	the	thorough	mastication	of	that	food	increase	the	value	of the	proteins,	fats,	and	carbohydrates?	The	thing	is	a	self-evident	fact.	In	the	first case	a	man	takes	food	which	quickly	turns	to	a	loathsome	poison.	In	the	second</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>instance	 the	 same	 kind	 of	 food	 is	 so	 thoroughly	 mixed	 with	 the	 ptyalin	 in	 the saliva	 that	 whatever	 is	 eaten	 becomes	 of	 value	 as	 protein	 or	 fat	 or	 some	 other food	element. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 many	 years	 of	 sad	 experience	 with	 this	 malady	 we	 call	 "nerves"	 I	 am convinced	 that	 the	 reason	 why	 people	 have	 this	 disease	 is	 because	 they	 are literally	"food	drunk."	I	have	treated	men	who	had	been	on	an	alcohol	debauch and	 I	 know	 how	 terribly	 depressed	 they	 are	 after	 such	 a	 spree	 is	 over.	 It	 is exactly	 the	 same	 way	 with	 the	 pre-nervous	 people	 that	 break	 down.	 They	 sit down	to	a	big	meal	and	overeat.	There	is	a	temporary	stimulus,	just	as	in	the	case of	the	person	who	takes	intoxicants,	followed	by	that	terrible	mental	depression that	all	who	have	suffered	from	"nerves"	know.	And	because	the	individual	with the	"nerves"	is	overeating	two	or	three	times	each	day,	he	stays	drunk	with	the poisons	that	form	in	his	stomach	and	intestines.	Such	people	over-assimilate	the poisonous	 products	 of	 proteins,	 especially	 of	 sugars.	 Of	 course	 this	 may	 seem oddly	 stated	 because	 we	 would	 not	 want	 any	 absorption	 of	 the	 poisons	 in	 the intestines,	 but	 it	 is	 probable	 that	 nature	 can	 and	 does	 take	 care	 of	 a	 little	 of	 it there	in	the	healthy	individual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 is	 perfectly	 absurd	 to	 say,	 as	 some	 physicians	 still	 continue	 to	 say,	 that	 no poisonous	matter	is	ever	absorbed	in	the	intestinal	tract.	Give	a	child	something that	 causes	 intestinal	 indigestion	 and	 see	 how	 quickly	 he	 has	 a	 rise	 in temperature.	This	fever	is	the	direct	result	of	poisons	absorbed	in	the	intestines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	case	of	the	nervous	adult,	however,	this	poison	does	not	as	often	result	in fever	 as	 it	 does	 in	 a	 horrible	 mental	 depression	 and	 a	 complete	 inability	 to perform	any	sort	of	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	so	there	seems	no	question	but	that	this	terrible	malady	we	call	"nerves,"	or a	 nervous	 breakdown	 in	 any	 of	 its	 many	 forms,	 is	 in	 a	 majority	 of	 cases	 the result	of	the	wrong	eating	habits	of	the	individual.	The	chewing	of	all	food	to	a cream	will	go	far	toward	curing	the	trouble,	but	in	most	cases	this	alone	will	not effect	a	cure.	It	would	not	have	done	so	in	my	own	case,	although	I	did	see	much improvement	as	a	result	of	that	practice	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	here	I	want	to	say	this:	There	are	many	who	say	they	cannot	eat	acid	fruits because	 of	 the	 distress	 they	 cause.	 Now	 if	 such	 people	 would	 always	 chew	 an apple,	a	pear,	or	other	fruit	to	a	cream,	no	distress	would	result	from	eating	fresh fruit.	But	such	people	must	follow	in	detail	the	diet	I	shall	give	farther	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now,	 facts	 cannot	 be	 stated	 too	 strongly.	 It	 is	 certain	 acid	 fruits	 will	 cause</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>distress	if	you	do	not	chew	them	to	a	cream.	I	would	swell	up	like	a	toad	if	I	ate only	 one	 apple	 hurriedly.	 I	 don't	 dare	 think	 what	 might	 happen	 to	 me	 if	 I	 ate three	or	four	in	that	way.	I	might	possibly	find	myself	transformed	into	a	human balloon	 and	 float	 away	 into	 space.	 But	 I	 don't	 eat	 apples	 that	 way—not	 now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	 who	 read	 these	 pages	 may	 think	 it	 very	 strange,	 yet	 it	 is	 quite	 true	 that there	really	are	persons	suffering	with	"nerves"	who	have	not	gumption	enough to	 follow	 this	 simple	 rule	 of	 chewing	 all	 food	 to	 a	 cream.	 I	 despair	 of	 ever helping	 those	 people.	 They	 still	 continue	 to	 dispose	 of	 a	 big	 meal	 in	 fifteen minutes,	and	then	insist	they	have	chewed	all	their	food	carefully.	I	have	had	that thing	 happen	 right	 before	 my	 own	 eyes.	 Then	 think	 of	 their	 complaining	 that they	cannot	eat	apples	because	they	cause	so	much	gas	in	the	stomach! </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	 reason	 why	 a	 large	 number	 of	 such	 people	 are	 troubled	 with	 gas,	 even though	they	do	chew	their	food	to	a	cream,	is	because	they	immediately	follow	a meal	 with	 one	 or	 two	 cups	 of	 tea	 or	 coffee.	 Now	 please	 remember	 this:	 An individual	 afflicted	 with	 "nerves"	 has	 no	 business	 drinking	 either	 tea	 or	 coffee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	should	let	them	both	alone.	Plain	hot	water	is	the	very	best	drink	in	the	world for	a	nervous	person.	If	you	want	a	drink	after	your	meal	drink	a	cup	of	plain	hot water.	 And	 you	 should	 also	 drink	 a	 cup	 of	 hot	 water	 half	 an	 hour	 before breakfast.	If	you	 do	not	care	 for	breakfast,	and	 feel	you	do	 not	 need	 this	 meal, drink	 the	 hot	 water	 anyway.	 The	 victim	 of	 "nerves"	 should	 never	 drink	 during the	meal	but	after	it,	if	he	must	drink	anything	at	all.	He	should	also	drink	a	pint or	more	of	cold	water	between	meals	every	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now,	another	thing	with	regard	to	chewing	all	solid	food	to	a	cream.	It	has	been proved	over	and	over	again	in	my	own	case	and	in	that	of	many	others,	that	in doing	 this	 the	 brain	 and	 muscles	 are	 both	 made	 stronger	 and	 keener	 for	 work, that	 those	 who	 chew	 their	 food	 in	 this	 way	 have	 much	 greater	 endurance,	 both mental	and	physical,	than	those	who	do	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today	 if	 I	 should	 relax	 my	 vigilance	 in	 respect	 to	 chewing	 my	 food	 I	 should soon	go	down	again.	But	with	this	aid,	which	I	now	so	easily	employ,	combined with	 exactly	 the	 right	 things	 to	 eat,	 I	 find	 I	 need	 have	 no	 fear.	 It	 has	 been	 ten years	 since	 my	 last	 breakdown	 and	 in	 that	 interval	 I	 have	 done	 the	 very	 best work	 and	 by	 far	 the	 hardest	 brain	 work	 of	 a	 lifetime.	 I	 do	 not	 believe	 people break	 down	 from	 overwork.	 You	 may	 think	 that	 a	 perfectly	 absurd	 statement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	have	good	grounds	upon	which	to	base	my	belief.	If	nervous	people	would eat	 sparingly	 and	 chew	 their	 food	 to	 a	 cream,	 eating	 the	 foods	 I	 shall	 mention later	on,	I	am	confident	they	would	rarely,	if	ever,	break	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>It	 is	 certain	 that	 in	 the	 last	 ten	 years,	 with	 the	 greatest	 mental	 strain	 on	 me,	 I should	 have	 gone	 down	 again,	 and	 perhaps	 more	 than	 once,	 if	 I	 had	 not	 found what	caused	"nerves"	and	how	to	prevent	it.	In	the	meantime	I	have	written	ten or	more	books,	and	every	writer,	at	least,	knows	what	a	nerve-racking	profession writing	 is.	 In	 addition	 to	 all	 this	 mental	 labor	 I	 have	 gone	 right	 ahead	 with	 my medical	practice.	Surely	there	is	balm	in	this	particular	Gilead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 if	 you	 will	 not	 chew	 your	 food	 to	 a	 cream	 you	 need	 not	 expect	 to	 win	 the entire	reward.	And	you	must	do	this	not	only	one	day	or	one	week	or	one	month or	one	year,	but	all	the	days,	weeks,	months,	and	years	that	you	may	live.	And, alas!	I	know	only	too	well	all	the	trouble	well-meaning	but	deluded	people	who sit	at	the	table	with	a	nervous	individual	will	make	him	when	they	discover	how much	time	he	is	taking	to	chew	his	food.	At	first,	because	of	the	length	of	time	I spent	at	a	meal,	such	people	thought	I	must	be	eating	as	much	as	a	horse.	But, here	 and	 there,	 for	 I	 was	 in	 many	 places,	 when	 people	 found	 out	 what	 I	 was doing,	they	would	only	courteously	deride	me	for	being	so	gullible	about	what they	termed	fads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	are	all	well	aware	that	the	vast	majority	of	Americans	do	not	chew	their	food to	a	cream	or	anything	like	it.	And	there	are	those,	therefore,	who	advance	as	an argument	that	because	the	majority	do	not	there	must	be	something	wrong	with the	minority	who	do.	Well,	let	us	follow	this	out	a	little:	Not	so	many	hundred years	ago	everybody	believed	the	world	was	 <i class="calibre4">flat</i>.	But	their	theory	did	not	make	it flat.	And	so,	even	though	thousands	of	people	who	crowd	our	eating	houses	do bolt	their	food,	that	does	not	prove	there	is	no	danger	in	the	practice.	And	they who	do	it	are	digging	their	graves	with	their	teeth. </p>

<p class="calibre1">People	 who	 are	 the	 offspring	 of	 nervous	 parents	 and	 who	 have	 had	 a	 nervous breakdown	 should	 not	 eat	 commercial	 sugar,	 eggs,	 or	 animal	 food	 of	 any	 kind whatever.	These	statements	may	seem	wholly	unimportant	to	some	people,	but	I realize	what	a	tremendous	bomb	I	throw	into	the	camps	of	others	when	they	read them.	You	see,	for	centuries	people	have	believed	meat	and	eggs	to	be	the	best	of all	foods;	so	when	I	make	a	statement	like	the	foregoing,	the	effect	is	not	unlike that	 which	 followed	 Columbus'	 statement	 that	 no	 matter	 what	 people	 believed, the	fact	was	that	the	earth	was	round,	not	flat.	From	the	very	beginning	it	has	not made	 a	 single	 bit	 of	 difference	 as	 to	 what	 physicians	 or	 anybody	 else	 thought; facts	count.	And	no	matter	what	we	may	think	or	how	long	we	have	thought	it, facts	go	right	on	being	facts	just	the	same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes,	 even	 after	 twenty	 years'	 experience,	 about	 once	 in	 two	 or	 three months—because	there	is	nothing	else	at	hand—I	find	myself	eating	a	small	bit of	 meat.	 This	 usually	 happens	 when	 I	 am	 on	 a	 lecture	 tour.	 But	 if	 I	 eat	 only	 a small	 slice	 of	 bacon	 at	 the	 evening	 meal	 I	 dream	 bad	 dreams	 and	 the	 next morning	 feel	 drowsy,	 heavy,	 and	 sluggish.	 Animal	 foods	 as	 well	 as	 eggs	 and commercial	 sugar	 poison	 all	 those	 born	 of	 nervous	 parents.	 I	 have	 proved	 the truth	of	this	by	my	own	case	and	by	several	years'	observation	of	other	cases. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>Do	 your	 children	 have	 "night	 terrors"?	 You	 answer,	 yes.	 Well,	 let	 me	 tell	 you how	 to	 stop	 these	 horrors	 in	 the	 little	 ones.	 If	 you	 give	 them	 meat—and remember	you	should	never	give	them	pork—let	them	have	a	very	small	piece	at noon,	never	at	night.	And	they	should	never	be	permitted	to	have	it	for	breakfast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Give	the	child	his	one	small	bit	of	meat	at	noon.	For	the	evening	meal	give	him some	 cereal	 with	 milk	 or	 cream,	 but	 no	 sugar.	 Give	 him	 all	 he	 wants	 of	 this special	dish,	but	nothing	else	at	that	meal,	and	you	will	find	his	"night	terrors" </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	moaning	will	cease. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	look	back	on	most	of	the	nights	of	my	childhood	with	horror,	for	until	I	became a	man	I	talked	in	my	sleep	and	had	the	most	horrible	dreams.	I	used	also	to	get up	in	my	sleep	and	walk	about	the	room.	My	parents	were	well	aware	of	the	fact that	all	of	their	eight	children	were	poor	sleepers,	and	of	them	all	I	was	by	far	the worst.	And,	although	it	was	innocently	done,	the	food	they	were	giving	us	was poisoning	us.	You	don't	need	to	think	that	in	order	to	take	poison	you	must	have strychnine	 or	 arsenic.	 No,	 indeed	 you	 don't.	 We	 were	 fed	 exactly	 as	 hundreds and	thousands	of	poor	little	ones	are	being	fed	now	as	this	is	being	written.	We were	fed	on	meat,	eggs,	and	fats,	and	when	we	became	ill,	friends	round	about us	thought	they	were	doing	something	real	kind	when	they	sent	in	a	nice	piece	of fried	 rabbit	 or	 some	 celebrated	 golden	 brown	 fried	 chicken.	 But	 we	 vomited	 at the	sight	of	the	food—which	was	really	our	salvation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	have	two	boys	of	my	own.	The	elder,	a	sturdy	chap	not	yet	ten	years	of	age,	has to	have	clothes	for	a	fourteen-year-old	boy,	and	he	is	much	stronger	than	any	boy of	 his	 age	 he	 has	 ever	 met.	 The	 younger	 boy	 is	 now	 seven	 and	 his	 physical development	is	wonderful	for	a	child	of	that	age.	Now	these	boys	hardly	know what	an	egg	is.	They	never	eat	one.	As	to	meat,	I	am	certain	that	since	they	were born	 they	 have	 not	 eaten	 it	 on	 an	 average	 of	 once	 a	 week.	 They	 have	 eaten	 a little,	but	you	will	admit	that	eating	meat	not	more	than	once	a	week,	and	often going	 weeks	 without	 a	 bit	 of	 it,	 certainly	 is	 eating	 very	 little.	 There	 have	 been times	when	they	have	not	seen	meat	for	three	months. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now,	I	don't	eat	as	I	do	and	have	my	children	eat	as	they	do	just	for	a	fad.	I	think nothing	is	more	stupid	and	silly	than	for	people	to	do	certain	things	just	because somebody	 else	 does	 them.	 We	 should	 all	 have	 good	 sound	 reasons	 for	 our actions	 in	 this	 world.	 We	 should	 all	 try	 our	 very	 best	 to	 use	 sound	 common sense.	 That's	 why	 I	 say	 that	 people	 who	 are	 the	 offspring	 of	 nervous	 parents should	 not	 eat	 animal	 food	 of	 any	 kind	 after	 they	 are	 twenty-one,	 and	 they should	never	at	any	time	eat	eggs.	It	would	be	far	better	for	them	if	they	did	not eat	commercial	sugar.	But	I	do	admit	that	when	some	of	these	people	get	well	by</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>dieting,	they	are	able	to	eat	sparingly	of	all	these	things	and	still	keep	well.	But some	people	can	never	eat	them	and	I	am	one	of	the	number. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 remember	 one	 summer	 about	 two	 years	 ago	 I	 was	 on	 a	 lecture	 tour	 for	 a Chautauqua	 Bureau,	 and	 it	 seemed	 that	 surely	 I	 got	 into	 the	 very	 worst	 eating places	that	summer	that	I	ever	had	in	my	life.	For	three	or	four	days	I	ate	only eggs,	 as	 they	 seemed	 to	 be	 about	 the	 only	 food	 I	 could	 get	 besides	 bread	 and butter.	At	the	end	of	the	third	day—I	remember	the	time	very	well—when	night came	I	could	not	sleep,	and	just	as	when	I	had	one	of	my	nervous	breakdowns, that	old	feeling	of	inexpressible	gloom	began	to	settle	over	me.	I	knew	instantly the	 cause	 of	 it,	 because	 twice	 before	 when	 I	 had	 purposely	 experimented	 with eating	eggs	I	had	had	similar	experiences.	I	immediately	took	a	heavy	cathartic and	after	having	thoroughly	rid	myself	of	the	poison	I	again	slept	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	am	not	alone	in	this	fight	against	the	use	of	eggs	for	nervous	people.	John Burroughs	 said	 that	 eggs	 poisoned	 him,	 and	 I	 have	 talked	 with	 men	 of	 great wealth	and	great	business	ability	who	have	reached	the	top	by	their	own	efforts, who	have	told	me	that	eggs	poisoned	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	 I	 have	 found	 that	 for	 these	 nervous	 people	 animal	 food	 is	 a	 slow	 poison. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sooner	or	later	it	will	do	its	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 just	 here	 I	 wish	 to	 say	 that	 there	 are	 some	 people	 who	 seemingly	 can	 eat almost	anything	and	not	suffer	from	so	doing.	Last	summer	I	talked	with	Count Ilya	Tolstoy,	son	of	Leo	Tolstoy,	the	celebrated	Russian	writer.	The	Count,	who is	also	a	lecturer,	told	me	that	he	was	obliged	to	have	eggs	and	that	he	had	eaten them	all	his	life.	He	said	his	appetite	was	never	satisfied	unless	he	ate	eggs.	He	is now	 past	 sixty,	 and	 apparently	 is	 strong	 and	 rugged.	 Now	 eggs	 no	 doubt	 are good	 for	 him.	 But	 right	 here	 is	 where	 infinite	 harm	 can	 be	 done	 to	 nervous people	 like	 myself.	 People	 who	 can	 eat	 everything—and	 among	 physicians seemingly	there	are	many	who	can	do	so—will	say	to	these	poor	sufferers:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why,	it's	all	nonsense	about	things	hurting	you!	Eat	anything	you	want	and	all you	want	and	then	forget	about	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Physicians	 have	 said	 that	 to	 me	 and	 during	 the	 past	 twenty	 years	 I	 have	 heard them	say	it	thousands	of	times	to	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Personally	 I	 do	 not	 believe	 in	 Christian	 Science—physicians	 of	 the	 Regular school	 do	 not	 believe	 in	 it;	 but	 do	 you	 know	 that	 when	 a	 physician	 says	 to	 a sufferer	 from	 "nerves,"	 "It's	 all	 nonsense	 about	 what	 you	 eat	 hurting	 you;	 eat</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>anything	 you	 want	 and	 then	 forget	 about	 it,"	 that	 physician	 is	 fully	 endorsing Christian	Science.	He	is	telling	the	person	to	whom	he	is	talking	that	there	is	no such	 thing	 as	 physical	 suffering.	 Of	 course,	 such	 a	 physician	 is	 nothing	 but	 a fool.	Yet	that's	why	so	many	of	these	people	turn	to	Christian	Science.	Yes,	that is	exactly	why	they	try	it.	It	bolsters	up	a	sufferer	for	a	time	just	as	contact	with	a magnetic	 and	 hopeful	 personality	 may	 for	 a	 time	 bolster	 one	 up.	 But	 such persons	 almost	 always	 go	 back	 to	 the	 sanitariums.	 "Nerves"	 is	 not	 a	 mental disease;	that	is,	the	seat	of	the	trouble	is	not	mental	but	physical,	and	the	mental phase	 of	 "nerves"	 is	 only	 a	 symptom,	 or	 rather	 one	 of	 the	 symptoms	 of	 the disease. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	people	who	have	gone	down	into	the	dark	valley	have	experienced	a	million, more	or	less,	different	kinds	of	feelings.	I	fully	believe	one	half	of	the	American people	are	the	offspring	of	nervous	parents.	This	means	that	there	are	fifty-five million	of	this	nervous	type	of	Americans.	This	type	includes	people	all	the	way from	the	man	in	an	office	who	gets	angry	quickly,	to	the	individual	who	is	in	a state	of	complete	collapse.	And	the	man	who	is	afflicted	with	nothing	more	than a	quick	temper,	or	is	living	under	high	nervous	tension,	is	liable	to	beget	children who	will	suffer	from	the	malady	in	a	far	worse	degree	than	ever	he	will,	unless, indeed,	 he	 eats	 only	 the	 things	 he	 should	 eat	 and	 observes	 a	 number	 of	 other rules	besides	the	two	I	have	already	laid	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now,	the	ideal	diet	for	nervous	people	is	a	slightly	modified	vegetarian	diet.	To be	 specific,	 it	 is	 a	 Lacto-vegetarian	 diet	 minus	 eggs.	 There	 are,	 however,	 two things	 included	 in	 this	 diet	 that	 I	 would	 warn	 one	 in	 the	 beginning	 to	 eat	 of sparingly.	 These	 are	 bananas	 and	 cooked	 cabbage.	 If	 they	 agree	 with	 you,	 well and	good;	but	if	they	do	not,	let	them	strictly	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eat	 all	 kinds	 of	 vegetables,	 both	 fresh	 and	 cooked.	 Eat	 all	 kinds	 of	 fruits, especially	fresh	fruits.	There	is	an	old	saying	and	a	good	one,	"An	apple	a	day keeps	the	doctor	away." </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 are	 a	 thousand	 ways	 to	 prepare	 vegetables	 and	 fruits	 for	 the	 table,	 and there	are	a	number	of	books	that	give	good	recipes.	If	a	nervous	individual	has never	 yet	 had	 a	 breakdown	 I	 believe	 he	 can	 safely	 eat	 most	 of	 the	 vegetarian dishes	 that	 have	 eggs	 in	 them,	 but	 it	 would	 be	 a	 serious	 mistake	 to	 select	 the special	dishes	that	contain	eggs	and	live	on	those	just	because	they	contain	eggs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 believe,	 too,	 that	 after	 a	 nervous	 person	 is	 restored	 to	 health,	 if	 he	 strictly observes	the	rules	of	eating	sparingly	and	of	chewing	all	food	to	a	cream,	he	may</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>safely	 try	 out	 such	 courses	 as	 are	 found	 in	  <i class="calibre4">Bardsley's	 Recipes	 for	 Food</i> <i class="calibre4">Reformers</i>	or	 <i class="calibre4">Broadbent's	Forty	Vegetarian	Dinners</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 may	 seem	 odd,	 but	 there	 are	 people	 who	 for	 some	 reason	 or	 other	 lack	 the instinct,	or	whatever	is	needed,	to	know	that	a	certain	thing	they	eat	hurts	them.	I have	had	men	and	women	sit	in	my	office	and	say	with	the	utmost	sincerity	that they	 were	 certain	 that	 it	 wasn't	 anything	 they	 ate	 that	 hurt	 them	 because	 they never	had	any	pain	in	the	abdomen.	Sometimes	these	people	were	in	a	dreadful state	of	nervous	breakdown.	So	you	see	the	danger	that	lies	here.	If	you	know, you	can	always	tell	what	special	thing	disagrees	with	you.	For	example,	I	know eggs	disagree	with	me,	and	like	John	Burroughs	and	many	others,	I	know	when they	 harm	 me.	 Therefore,	 after	 you	 have	 recovered	 you	 might	 try	 being	 your own	physician.	But	if	you	are	not	sure	as	to	what	disagrees	with	you,	you	would much	better	stick	to	a	vegetarian	diet	and	go	without	eggs	the	remainder	of	your days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Commercial	 sugar	 also	 is	 the	 cause	 of	 many	 breakdowns	 among	 the	 people	 of this	country.	And	is	it	not	strange	how	these	poor	suffering	people	crave	sweets</p>
<p class="calibre1">—the	 very	 thing	 they	 should	 not	 have.	 They	 will	 argue	 with	 themselves—and some	physicians	will	agree	with	them—that	they	should	go	right	on	eating	candy because	they	want	it.	But,	as	I	have	already	said,	there	is	just	as	much	sense	in saying	 a	 man	 should	 have	 whiskey	 because	 he	 craves	 it	 or	 that	 a	 young	 man should	 have	 tobacco	 because	 he	 craves	 it,	 as	 to	 say	 that	 any	 one	 should	 have candy	because	he	craves	it.	There	is	absolutely	no	sense	in	such	an	argument.	If you	 are	 suffering	 from	 a	 nervous	 breakdown,	 for	 sixty	 days	 quit	 eating	 candy and	everything	sweet	except	honey,	and	follow	the	other	rules	I	have	already	laid down.	It	may	be	that	you	will	have	to	stick	to	this	diet	for	three	months.	But	try it.	That	is	exactly	what	cured	all	my	bodily	ills	and	brought	my	soul	out	of	the dark	and	gloomy	night	after	everything	else	had	failed.	I	do	not	mean	to	say	that this	diet	alone	cured	me,	but	I	do	say	it	was	the	biggest	factor	in	the	cure.	There are,	however,	some	other	things	that	it	would	be	worse	than	folly	to	ignore.	This I	shall	come	to	later.	But	just	here	I	want	to	have	it	understood	that	this	thing	of eating—how	 you	 eat,	 and	 how	 much	 you	 eat,	 and	 what	 you	 eat—is	 of transcendent	importance	in	the	cure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	 course,	 under	 some	 circumstances	 connected	 with	 cases	 of	 breakdown, nothing	but	the	good	judgment	of	friends	will	avail.	For	example,	the	question	of how	much	one	shall	eat	is	something	that	not	all	the	books	in	the	world	nor	all the	 physicians	 in	 the	 world	 can	 determine.	 I	 say,	 always	 quit	 while	 you	 want	 a little	more.	I	cannot	say	more	or	less	than	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>So	many	have	written	me	recently	asking	just	what	I	eat,	that	it	may	be	a	help	to some	of	them	if	I	set	down	here	just	what	I	ate	today.	I	ate	no	breakfast	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes	I	go	for	weeks	without	eating	breakfast.	This	is	especially	apt	to	be the	case	if	I	am	engaged	in	writing	a	magazine	article	or	a	book.	I	find	my	brain is	much	clearer	and	that	I	can	work	much	better	when	I	eat	no	breakfast.	But	I	do drink	one	or	two	cups	of	very	weak	tea.	I	use	just	enough	tea	to	color	the	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	 I	 do	 not	 advise	 everybody	 to	 go	 without	 breakfast.	 Some	 people	 tell	 me that	they	have	a	headache	unless	they	eat	something.	And	some	writers	say	that if	they	do	not	eat	a	little	breakfast	they	cannot	write	so	well.	Thus	you	see	where the	question	of	common	sense	and	using	your	own	judgment	comes	in.	There	are always	a	few	things	you	will	have	to	decide	for	yourselves.	At	noon	I	ate	about two	 handfuls	 of	 corn	 flakes	 with	 milk	 and	 cream	 but	 no	 sugar,	 finishing	 with about	four	ounces	of	bread	pudding	that	had	a	little	brown	sugar	in	it.	Now,	in mid-afternoon,	as	I	write	this,	I	am	not	hungry.	Tonight	I	shall	eat	another	dish	of corn	flakes	and	some	buttered	toast	and	three	or	perhaps	four	good-sized	apples, I	usually	eat	three	or	four	apples	a	day.	If	I	want	a	piece	of	pie	for	lunch,	I	eat	it, but	I	eat	nothing	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 live	 on	 the	 plainest	 of	 plain	 foods.	 Apples	 used	 to	 create	 a	 lot	 of	 gas	 in	 my stomach,	 but	 now	 they	 do	 not	 because	 I	 chew	 them	 to	 a	 cream.	 Milk	 used	 to make	me	constipated,	but	it	does	not	when	I	chew	the	cereal	with	it	carefully	and eat	a	number	of	apples. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	 nervous	 people	 are	 constipated.	 But	 apples	 are	 really	 the	 salvation	 of nervous	people.	If	you	are	constipated,	drink,	or	rather,	sip,	a	glass	of	hot	water half	an	hour	before	breakfast,	then	eat	nothing	for	breakfast	but	apples;	eat	two big	ones	and	chew	them	slowly	to	a	cream.	Go	to	stool	regularly	every	morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	habit	is	half	the	cure	of	constipation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apples,	 of	 all	 things	 I	 know,	 are	 the	 finest	 things	 for	 the	 liver.	 If	 you	 take	 a patient	ill	from	chronic	indigestion,	whose	stools	are	clay	colored,	and	put	him on	a	diet	of	apples,	if	he	chews	properly,	in	less	than	twenty-four	hours	the	stools will	 be	 of	 the	 regulation	 dark	 brown	 color,	 as	 they	 should	 be	 when	 the	 liver	 is working	 in	 a	 normal,	 healthful	 manner.	 And	 eating	apples	will	work	in	exactly the	same	way	with	children	as	with	adults. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apples,	apples,	apples!	Eat	them	no	matter	what	the	price.	You	remember	how good	 Adam	 found	 the	 apple—or	 at	 least	 we	 presume	 it	 was	 an	 apple	 that	 he found	so	good—and	I	can	think	of	no	other	single	thing	that	would	tempt	a	man to	make	all	the	trouble	he	did.	If	he	had	to	sin,	then	I'm	for	Adam	every	time,	for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>I	think	had	I	been	in	his	place	and	Eve	had	offered	me	a	big	juicy	red	apple,	I should	have	taken	it	and	eaten	it.	I	don't	know	but	that	I	might	even	have	eaten	it without	 the	 invitation.	 I	 think	 that	 Adam's	 great	 mistake	 was	 not	 so	 much	 in eating	the	apple	as	in	trying	to	lay	the	blame	on	the	woman.	Nobody	should	ever apologize	for	having	eaten	an	apple. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now,	generally	speaking,	there	is	one	thing	a	nervous	parent—or	any	other	kind of	 parent	 for	 that	 matter—should	 never	 say	 to	 a	 child.	 Never	 tell	 him	 he	 is nervous.	If	we	realize	that	our	children	are	the	offspring	of	nervous	parents,	it	is, as	I	have	already	suggested,	much	better	for	all	concerned,	for	we	cannot	avoid	a danger	unless	we	know	what	or	where	the	danger	is.	When	we	know	the	child	is nervous	 we	 should	 plan	 carefully,	 leaving	 out	 of	 his	 diet	 all	 pastries	 and	 rich greasy	foods,	and	keep	him	largely	on	a	vegetarian	diet.	But,	as	I	have	already suggested,	we	do	not	need	to	diet	a	nervous	child	as	strictly	as	we	do	a	nervous adult	 where	 infinite	 harm	 has	 already	 been	 done.	 Give	 the	 nervous	 child	 meat only	 a	 part	 of	 the	 time,	 and	 if	 he	 goes	 without	 eggs	 it	 will	 be	 all	 the	 better	 for him.	I	wish	from	the	bottom	of	my	heart	that	I	had	never	tasted	an	egg! </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	a	fine	thing	it	would	be	if	we	so	trained	our	children	that	they	would	never suffer	 from	 "nerves"!	 And	 usually	 it	 could	 be	 done.	 The	 belief	 that	 because nervous	 parents	 have	 broken	 down	 their	 children	 sooner	 or	 later	 must	 break down,	 is	 our	 greatest	 curse.	 But	 such	 a	 belief	 is	 absurd,	 for	 if	 dieting,	 outdoor exercise,	and	a	few	other	simple	rules	are	observed,	there	is	no	danger	that	it	will happen.	 To	 be	 sure,	 these	 rules	 must	 be	 definitely	 understood	 and	 strictly adhered	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	we	treat	this	misfortune	in	the	manner	I	shall	mention	later,	we	can	make	our lives	 more	 successful	 and	 infinitely	 happier	 than	 the	 lives	 of	 those	 who	 have never	 learned	 self-control.	 For	 instance,	 I	 am	 far	 healthier	 than	 men	 all	 around me	who	seem	to	be	able	to	eat	three	Christmas	dinners	each	day.	They	sit	at	the table	and	boast	about	being	"good	feeders,"	then	later	they	come	to	me	for	pills, saying,	"There	is	nothing	the	matter	with	me,	doctor,	but	I	thought	I	had	better take	a	little	medicine	so	I	won't	get	ill."	But	they	don't	fool	me.	I	know	exactly what	is	the	matter	with	them.	They	are	so	full	of	pork	they	can't	think.	To	tell	the truth,	 we	 people	 who	 have	 suffered	 from	 a	 nervous	 breakdown	 or	 some	 illness akin	 to	 it,	 and	 have	 learned	 that	 we	 must	 eat	 right	 or	 die,	 are	 of	 all	 people	 the most	fortunate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every	now	and	then	I	hear	some	good	old	sister,	with	a	face	like	a	full	moon	and jowls	like	a	bloodhound,	say,	as	she	finishes	her	third	piece	of	mince	pie,—her</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>waist	 line	 having	 extended	 accordingly,—"Isn't	 it	 too	 bad	 about	 poor	 brother Jones!	He	looks	so	terribly	thin!	They	say	he	has	fallen	away	from	one	hundred and	sixty	pounds	to	only	a	hundred	and	fifty.	And	they	do	say	he	can't	eat	meat and	eggs	at	all!	The	poor	man!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	the	real	facts	of	the	case	are	that	brother	Jones	is	able	to	walk	ten	miles	any day,	and	the	possibility	is	that	in	the	not	distant	future	he	will	read	in	his	morning paper	that	sister	Sue	Portly	has	been	operated	on	for	gall	stones	and	the	number reported	is	almost	unbelievable,	about	three	hundred,	in	fact.	And	so,	all	the	time sister	 Portly	 was	 feeling	 sorry	 for	 lithe,	 energetic	 brother	 Jones,	 she	 was	 a walking	stone	quarry,	as	it	were,	and	yet	didn't	know	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	don't	worry	because	you	have	to	diet	or	because	after	reading	these	lines	you determine	that	you	must	begin	to	diet.	For,	whoever	you	are,	and	wherever	you may	be,	you	belong	to	a	most	fortunate	class	of	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	now	I	wish	to	say	some	things	about	what	nervous	people	should	do	besides dieting,	and	especially	do	I	wish	to	say	these	things	to	those	now	suffering	from a	 nervous	 breakdown.	 Much	 of	 it	 at	 least	 will	 apply	 to	 children	 of	 nervous parentage.	 You	 will	 observe	 as	 you	 go	 along	 that	 I	 keep	 mentioning	 "these children."	 I	 do	 so	 always	 with	 the	 thought	 in	 mind	 that	 there	 is	 absolutely	 no need	 for	 them	 ever	 to	 break	 down	 if	 these	 common	 sense	 rules	 are	 followed.	 I take	 it	 that	 not	 any	 one	 of	 us	 or	 a	 number	 of	 us,	 but	 that	 all	 of	 us	 love	 our children	 more	 than	 we	 love	 ourselves.	 Admitting	 the	 truth	 of	 this,	 then	 we should	 all	 be	 interested	 in	 this	 system	 for	 them	 as	 well	 as	 for	 ourselves,	 for	 as their	nerves	are	so	shall	their	success	be. </p>

<p class="calibre1">People	in	this	country	are	now	beginning	to	get	away	from	the	idea	that	a	man	or woman	 who	 is	 past	 sixty	 is	 getting	 "old."	 When	 the	 Rev.	 John	 Wesley,	 the itinerant	 preacher	 and	 author,	 was	 eighty-eight	 years	 old—please	 note	 the eighty-eight—he	walked	six	miles	to	keep	a	preaching	appointment.	When	asked if	 the	 walk	 tired	 him,	 he	 laughed	 and	 said:	 "Why,	 no!	 Not	 at	 all!	 The	 only difference	I	can	see	in	my	endurance	now	and	when	I	was	twenty	is	that	I	cannot run	quite	so	fast." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	know	there	are	calamity-howlers	who	say:	"Oh,	well,	some	people	are	born	to success	and	long	life	and	some	are	not!"	The	individual	who	permits	himself	to get	into	that	frame	of	mind	is	doomed	and	no	one	can	help	him.	Such	reasoning is	of	course	all	nonsense.	John	Wesley	was	always	a	spare	eater.	Yet	he	lived	an active	 outdoor	 life,	 often	 traveling	 forty	 and	 even	 sixty	 miles	 a	 day	 on horseback.	 He	 never	 failed	 to	 keep	 an	 appointment	 on	 account	 of	 the	 weather. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	he	was	a	tireless	worker,	often	preaching	four	and	five	times	a	day.	At	the same	time	he	read	and	wrote	every	spare	moment,	turning	out	a	large	amount	of literary	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	 Eliot,	 ex-President	 of	 Harvard	 College,	 a	 constant	 writer	 and	 speaker,	 and among	the	greatest	of	American	educators—now	nearer	90	than	80	years	of	age</p>
<p class="calibre1">—is	also	a	moderate	eater.	He	says,	"I	have	always	eaten	moderately	of	simple food	 in	 great	 variety.	 This	 practice	 is	 probably	 the	 result,	 first,	 of	 a	 natural tendency,	 and	 then	 of	 confirmed	 habit	 and	 much	 experience	 under	 varying</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>conditions	 of	 work	 and	 play.	 From	 much	 observation	 of	 eating	 habits	 of	 other people,	 both	 the	 young	 and	 the	 mature,	 I	 am	 convinced	 that	 moderation, simplicity,	and	variety	in	eating	are	more	important	than	any	other	bodily	habit towards	 maintaining	 good	 health,	 power	 of	 work,	 and,	 barring	 accidents, attaining	to	enjoyable	old	age." </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 is	 interesting	 to	 note	 what	 that	 eminent	 lawyer,	 legislator,	 and	 orator, Chauncey	M.	Depew,	had	to	say	on	the	occasion	of	his	eighty-seventh	birthday about	a	simple	diet	and	reaching	the	century	mark.	"The	true	philosophy	of	life is	this:	The	more	you	like	a	thing	the	more	reason	there	is	for	giving	it	up	if	you find	it	is	not	good	for	you.	If	you	treat	nature	properly,	nature	will	adjust	herself to	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My	diet	is	very	simple.	I	have	the	same	breakfast	every	day	in	the	year,	and	it consists	of	an	orange,	one	four-minute	egg,	one	half	of	a	corn	muffin,	and	a	cup of	 coffee	 which	 is	 mainly	 hot	 milk.	 I	 have	 this	 at	 half	 past	 eight.	 My	 hour	 of rising	is	seven	every	morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"For	luncheon	I	partake	principally	of	vegetables,	with	no	meat,	and	a	glass	of water.	This	is	at	one	o'clock.	At	dinner	I	skip	most	of	the	courses	and	enjoy	small portions	 of	 vegetables,	 fish,	 and	 fowl.	 I	 never	 eat	 between	 meals	 and	 consume now	less	than	half	I	did	at	fifty." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 vigor	 and	 long	 life	 of	 Bishop	 Fallows	 of	 Chicago	 are	 mainly	 due	 to	 his living	and	mental	habits	and	to	his	simple	diet.	He	is	well	over	85	years	of	age, but	few	men	of	three-score	years	can	do	as	much	work,	the	year	round.	There	are two	or	three	sermons	and	several	public	addresses	each	week,	and	the	work	of	a large	parish—from	marriages	and	christenings	to	funerals	and	parish	visitings—</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	is	never	slighted.	An	active	Grand	Army	man	and	Civil	War	veteran,	he	is asked	 to	 address	 countless	 military	 and	 patriotic	 gatherings,	 and	 his	 energy seems	as	tireless	as	his	spirit	is	willing.	His	ability	to	meet	these	demands	can	be traced	back	to	simple	living	and	simple	eating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Bishop	is	temperate	in	all	things,	and	refuses	to	worry.	He	neither	drinks	nor smokes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 regard	 to	 his	 diet	 he	 says,	 "I	 eat	 very	 little	 meat,	 but	 take	 plenty	 of	 fruit, cereals	and	vegetables.	I	take	regularly	before	breakfast	a	cup	of	hot	grape	juice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	use	it	frequently	at	other	times.	I	take	buttermilk	daily."	Night	and	morning	he takes	simple	physical	exercises,	and	always	walks	at	least	a	couple	of	miles	each day. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>The	Bishop's	ancestors	were	long-lived.	His	great	grandfather	lived	to	be	96;	his grandfather,	91;	his	eldest	brother,	93.	His	father's	death	from	a	fall	occurred	at the	age	of	81.	He	has	a	brother	who	is	92.	This	in	itself	is	evidence	that	he	comes of	 a	 family	 in	 which	 right	 living—which	 means	 simple	 living—has	 prevailed until	its	effects	have	shown	in	each	succeeding	generation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 world-renowned	 American	 inventor,	 Thomas	 A.

And	 Edison	 is	 another spare	 eater.	 What	 he	 ate	 at	 the	 three	 meals	 of	 the	 day	 on	 which	 he	 wrote	 the following	 letter,	 is	 characteristic	 of	 the	 small	 amount	 he	 eats	 every	 day	 in	 the year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	you	will	learn	that	this	is	true	of	every	man	or	woman	who	has	lived	long and	is	still	doing	active	brain	work.	And	so,	once	for	all,	let	us	think	right	about this	matter.	We	get	out	of	ourselves	just	about	what	we	put	into	ourselves	or	do for	ourselves	in	the	way	of	food	and	exercise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	 people	 do	 not	 take	 enough	 systematic	 outdoor	 exercise.	 And	 exercise,	 I would	 have	 you	 understand,	 is	 another	 essential	 in	 the	 cure	 of	 one	 who	 has</p>
<p class="calibre1">"nerves."	 But	 I	 am	 quite	 sure	 that	 a	 lot	 of	 bad	 advice	 has	 been	 given	 women sufferers	 along	 this	 line.	 I	 find	 that	 as	 a	 rule,	 women	 make	 better	 progress,	 at least	at	first,	with	complete	rest	or	as	much	rest	as	they	can	possibly	get.	I	have seen	 great	 harm	 come	 from	 telling	 a	 woman	 afflicted	 with	 "The	 Mysterious Disease"—as	 it	 is	 often	 called—to	 take	 long	 walks.	 I	 am	 always	 extremely careful	 about	 telling	 such	 a	 woman	 to	 indulge	 in	 vigorous	 exercise.	 Some women,	 of	 course,	 are	 much	 stronger	 than	 others.	 My	 advice	 to	 a	 woman	 is	 to walk	in	the	open	air	unless	she	is	so	ill	she	cannot	walk	at	all	without	becoming very	weak.	And	here	again	each	person	must	use	common	sense	and	decide	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter	herself.	But	no	person	with	a	nervous	breakdown	should	ever	work	at	any task	or	take	any	kind	of	exercise	to	the	point	of	exhaustion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 well	 remember	 a	 man	 who	 came	 to	 me	 some	 years	 ago	 suffering	 from	 this malady.	He	had	been	trying	to	get	well	by	doing	heavy	stunts	in	a	gymnasium. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	very	muscular,	in	fact	he	was	an	athlete,	and	was	still	under	twenty-five years	of	age.	His	cheeks	were	ruddy,	and	to	the	ordinary	observer	he	appeared	to be	in	the	pink	of	condition.	But	he	had	that	peculiar	expression	of	the	eyes	that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>flashed	his	story	to	me	as	plainly	as	if	blazoned	forth	by	the	letters	of	an	electric sign.	 I	 told	 him	 at	 once	 that	 he	 could	 never	 hope	 to	 cure	 his	 nerves	 by	 such violent	exercises. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 right	 here	 let	 me	 advise	 men	 in	 this	 condition	 not	 to	 run.	 I	 receive	 many letters	of	inquiry	from	young	men	with	broken-down	nerves	who	tell	me	they	are taking	long	walks	and	finishing	with	a	run.	To	all	such	I	say:	Do	not	run.	I	know all	about	it	for	I	have	tried	it.	I	was	on	my	university	football	team.	And	all	my life	I	have	been	fond	of	athletics.	I	am	still	fond	of	this	kind	of	life	and	always expect	to	be,	but	exercise	is	frequently	overdone	by	nervous	people.	Usually,	the physically	strong	man	who	breaks	down	with	"nerves"	thinks	at	once	of	physical training.	But	strange	as	it	may	seem,	you	can	make	such	a	man's	muscles	as	hard as	iron	but	that	alone	will	not	cure	him.	And	it	is	true	that	many	people	in	this condition	 do	 not	 seem	 nervous	 for	 they	 are	 not	 at	 all	 shaky,	 as	 some	 think	 an individual	should	be	if	he	is	the	victim	of	a	nervous	breakdown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	well	remember	that	one	day	when	at	my	worst	I	could	not	work	nor	concentrate my	mind	on	anything.	I	chanced	to	be	in	Topeka,	Kansas,	and	passed	a	shooting gallery.	 I	 was	 a	 good	 rifle	 shot	 and	 I	 had	 been	 taking	 long	 walks	 and	 shooting Kansas	 jack	 rabbits.	 I	 went	 in,	 picked	 up	 one	 of	 the	 rifles,	 and	 started	 firing	 at the	 biggest	 target.	 I	 rang	 the	 bell	 twice	 on	 that	 target	 in	 succession,	 and	 then aimed	at	the	finest	target	there	and	rang	the	bell	twice	in	succession	on	that.	The proprietor	 was	 very	 much	 surprised,	 saying	 it	 was	 remarkably	 good	 shooting; and	yet	I	was	down	and	out	with	"nerves."	I	have	seen	many	athletes	who,	to	the untrained	 observer,	 looked	 well,	 but	 who	 in	 reality	 were	 nervous	 wrecks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outdoor	exercise	alone	will	not	cure	such	people,	or	if	seemingly	it	does—and this	 is	 important—sooner	 or	 later	 the	 individual	 is	 sure	 to	 go	 down	 again.	 You have	first	to	remove	the	cause,	and	that	is	largely	wrong	diet.	Now	of	course	it	is only	reasonable	to	say	that	if	such	an	individual	does	not	get	out	of	doors	at	all he	cannot	get	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	is	one	trouble	with	many	of	our	women	today.	They	will	go	on	a	diet	and stick	to	it,	but	they	will	not	get	out	of	doors.	If	they	do	go	out,	they	ride	a	little distance	in	a	street	car	or	in	an	automobile	to	do	some	shopping.	Or	they	go	to	a store	 and	 spend	 a	 good	 deal	 of	 time	 there—indoors,	 mind	 you—and	 then	 are whirled	home	again.	Some	of	them	seem	to	think	that	is	taking	outdoor	exercise, but	of	course	it	is	not.	So	many	times	they	have	said	to	me,	"Why,	I	do	get	out!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes,	they	do	get	out,	but	they	immediately	go	indoors	again. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>must	be	spent	in	bed,	should	get	out	of	doors	at	least	three	or	four	hours	a	day, every	 day	 in	 the	 week.	 This	 is	 a	 general	 rule	 that	 should	 be	 observed	 by everyone.	 It	 takes	 genuine	 courage,	 I	 know,	 for	 a	 man	 or	 woman	 to	 spend	 this much	time	out	of	doors.	And	I	know	that	those	who	are	compelled	to	work	for	a living	 cannot	 take	 three	 hours	 all	 at	 one	 time.	 But	 labor	 conditions	 in	 this country	are	such	that	I	am	sure	the	vast	majority	of	our	people	could	spend	this much	time	outdoors	in	wholesome	recreation	if	they	would	make	up	their	mind to	do	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 remember	 this:	 After	 the	 nervous	 person	 is	 cured	 he	 should	 never	 let anything	 prevent	 him	 from	 continuing	 such	 outdoor	 exercise.	 I	 am	 constantly trying	 to	 make	 this	 point—when	 you	 get	 well	 you	 should	 stay	 well.	 One breakdown	is	bad	enough;	don't	have	another.	And	you	will	not	have	another	if you	will	change	the	habits	of	a	lifetime	as	you	are	advised	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among	farmers	there	are	many,	the	offspring	of	nervous	parents	with	bad	eating habits,	 who	 suffer	 from	 nervous	 breakdowns.	 So	 you	 see	 exercise	 out	 of	 doors alone	will	not	cure	such	cases.	Sometimes	a	farmer	will	tell	me	he	fears	to	give up	eating	meat	because	he	will	grow	weak	as	a	result.	But	just	here	I	wish	to	call your	 attention	 to	 the	 fact	 that	 there	 are	 nations	 that	 have	 for	 ages	 lived	 on	 this lacto-vegetarian	diet.	I	myself	have	not	eaten	meat	or	eggs	for	ten	years.	At	least I	 have	 not	 eaten	 them	 except	 the	 few	 times	 mentioned.	 And	 every	 time	 I	 did break	 the	 rule	 I	 was	 harmed	 far	 more	 than	 I	 was	 benefited.	 I	 am	 very	 sure	 the farmer	who	chooses	this	lacto-vegetarian	diet	will	thrive	on	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Members	of	our	profession	discovered	not	very	long	ago	that	at	an	advanced	age the	peasants	of	 Bulgaria	are	a	 wonderfully	preserved	people	 both	mentally	and physically.	 Foolishly	 a	 great	 number	 of	 the	 profession	 immediately	 jumped	 to the	 conclusion	 that	 buttermilk	 alone	 did	 the	 miracle	 for	 these	 people.	 The drinking	 of	 buttermilk	 became	 such	 a	 fad	 that	 some	 of	 the	 largest	 of	 our physicians'	 supply	 houses	 began	 and	 are	 still	 making	 "buttermilk	 tablets."	 And physicians,	many	of	them,	are	credulous	enough	to	prescribe	them.	They	might just	as	well	prescribe	chalk.	While	buttermilk	tablets	are	harmless,	they	are	of	no benefit	 whatever.	 How	 easily	 fooled	 people—physicians	 included—may	 be! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bulgarian	peasants	are	strong	and	rugged	and	live	to	a	great	age	not	because	they drink	 buttermilk,	 but	 because	 they	 live	 on	 milk	 and	 fruits	 and	 vegetables	 and stay	 out	 of	 doors.	 Buttermilk	 is	 a	 good	 healthful	 drink,	 but	 it	 is	 only	 a	 minor reason	 for	 the	 health	 and	 strength	 of	 the	 Bulgarian	 peasant.	 Now,	 really,	 could you	 think	 of	 anything	 more	 absurd	 than	 to	 prescribe	 buttermilk	 or	 buttermilk tablets	 as	 the	 fountain	 of	 youth	 when	 the	 patient	 is	 breaking	 all	 the	 laws	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>health,	 as	 most	 buttermilk	 laymen	 and	 physicians	 are	 doing?	 It	 seems	 almost impossible	that	people—physicians	in	particular—should	for	a	moment	believe such	things.	But	they	do.	Barnum	said	there	was	a	"sucker"	born	every	minute, and	this	certainly	seems	to	be	true. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No,	there	is	no	royal	road	to	health.	The	buttermilk-tablet	route	will	not	take	you there.	If	you	will	live	out	of	doors	as	Bulgarian	peasants	do,	and	if	you	will	eat as	 they	 do,—as	 man	 is	 expected	 to	 eat,—you	 will	 live	 just	 as	 long	 as	 they	 do, and	 you	 will	 get	 a	 great	 deal	 more	 out	 of	 life	 and	 be	 much	 more	 helpful	 to others.	When	the	"time"	comes	round	for	your	next	buttermilk	tablet,	do	not	take it.	Instead,	do	as	those	peasants	do—leave	off	eating	meat	and	take	a	two-hour walk	 in	 the	 sunshine.	 Then	 when	 nine	 o'clock	 comes,	 like	 the	 Bulgarian,	 go	 to bed	and	stay	there	until	morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	the	person	afflicted	with	"nerves"	expects	to	get	well	and	stay	well,	he	must	go to	bed	at	an	early	hour	and	get	eight	or	nine	hours	of	sleep	not	only	some	nights but	 every	 night	 in	 the	 week.	 When	 one	 begins	 dieting	 and	 taking	 outdoor exercise	he	should	go	to	bed	regularly	at	an	early	hour	even	though	he	has	not been	 sleeping	 well.	 No	 matter	 how	 many	 sleepless	 nights	 he	 has	 experienced before	 beginning	 this	 regime,	 he	 should	 retire	 early	 just	 the	 same,	 because, sooner	 or	 later,	 sleep	 will	 come	 and	 the	 relaxed	 body	 is	 resting	 even	 if	 the individual	does	not	sleep.	Now	I	have	been	through	all	this	lying	awake	at	night, so	I	know	from	experience	that	it	is	best	to	go	to	bed	early	and	at	a	regular	hour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 you	 can,	 you	 should	 sleep	 nine	 hours.	 Nervous	 people	 need	 more	 sleep	 than others.	Sleep	is	a	better	restorer	of	nerves	than	anything	else	we	can	try.	I	do	not believe	that	ten	or	even	eleven	hours'	sleep	would	be	harmful	to	a	nervous	adult, because	very	often	I	have	seen	such	a	person	benefited	by	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Children	should	have	all	the	sleep	they	want	up	to	ten	or	twelve	hours.	But	after a	 child	 has	 wakened	 in	 the	 morning	 he	 should	 be	 permitted	 to	 get	 up.	 It	 is	 not good	for	him	to	lie	in	bed	after	he	wishes	to	rise,	for	nature	is	calling	him	to	get up	and	exercise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	nervous	individual	not	only	should	exercise	systematically	out	of	doors	but he	should	play	some	game.	You	remember	when	we	were	children	how	much	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">loved	to	play?	Well,	to	give	up	play	when	we	grow	up	is	all	nonsense.	And	just because	 people	 quit	 playing	 is	 the	 reason	 they	 have	 wrinkles	 and	 frowns.	 Did you	ever	notice	how	often	people	laugh	when	at	play?	There	is	something	about play	 that	 compels	 one	 to	 laugh.	 And	 what	 all	 people	 need,	 nervous	 people	 and others	as	well,	is	to	get	into	the	habit	of	laughing	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>And	it	is	not	hard	to	find	something	to	play.	I	like	to	play	at	basket	ball	with	a child,	and	I	can	enjoy	tossing	a	ball	for	an	hour	if	the	child	will	stick	to	the	game that	long.	Playing	basket	ball	in	the	open	air	on	a	sunshiny	day	is	one	of	the	very finest	exercises	in	the	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	you	are	suffering	from	"nerves"	and	are	able	to	be	out	of	doors	at	all,—I	mean if	you	are	well	enough	to	be	out,	and	at	least	nine	out	of	ten	sufferers	are,—get	a basket	ball	and	get	some	one	to	play	with	you.	If	at	first	you	are	poor	at	catching the	ball	you	will	with	practice	improve.	Gradually	toss	the	ball	a	little	higher	and a	 little	 higher	 until	 you	 have	 difficulty	 in	 catching	 it.	 Any	 woman	 or	 girl	 can stand	this	sort	of	open	air	exercise.	If	the	weather	is	cold,	no	matter;	wrap	up	and play	 anyway.	 But	 enter	 into	 the	 game	 with	 spirit.	 Playing	 the	 regular	 game	 of basket	ball	is	too	violent	exercise	for	the	nervous	person.	The	victim	of	"nerves" </p>
<p class="calibre1">should	 always	 keep	 in	 mind	 that	 it	 is	 mild	 outdoor	 exercise	 that	 will	 do	 him good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tennis	 is	 too	 violent	 an	 exercise	 for	 people	 who	 have	 had	 nervous	 trouble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway,	there	is	no	use	in	one's	doing	anything	that	will	make	his	heart	beat	like a	 trip-hammer.	 A	 women	 can	 toss	 a	 basket	 ball	 and	 laugh	 and	 get	 rosy	 cheeks and	grow	younger	and	prettier	as	easily	as	when	playing	tennis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Golf	is	also	good	exercise,	but	a	large	number	of	people	who	work	for	a	living and	 suffer	 from	 "nerves"	 would	 have	 little	 chance	 for	 exercise	 if	 golf	 were	 all that	could	be	offered	them.	Furthermore	golf	is	practically	only	a	summer	game, and	 an	 individual	 belonging	 to	 the	 pre-nervous	 class	 needs	 outdoor	 exercise every	day	in	the	year.	But	golf	is	excellent	exercise,	and	there	is	nothing	better	if one	has	the	time	to	give	to	it	and	has	access	to	links. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bicycling	 is	 splendid	 exercise	 for	 nervous	 people,	 but	 automobiles	 are	 so numerous	that	it	is	now	considered	almost	dangerous	to	ride	a	wheel	on	any	of our	main	traveled	roads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mountain	 climbing,	 I	 believe,	 is	 not	 to	 be	 recommended	 for	 most	 people suffering	from	"nerves."	I	have	known	such	people	to	go	to	Colorado	and	spend some	time	climbing	mountains,	and	then	come	back	much	worse	than	when	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">went	away.	My	advice	to	the	nervous	person	who	goes	to	the	mountains	is	to	be out	 of	 doors	 all	 the	 time	 he	 can,	 but	 to	 take	 things	 easy.	 It	 would	 be	 better	 for such	 a	 person	 to	 walk	 about	 slowly	 on	 the	 level	 ground	 through	 some	 of	 the towns	or	along	the	foothills. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let	leisure	be	your	watchword	in	a	hill	country.	I	know	I	injured	my	nerves	out</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>in	Colorado	one	summer	because	I	was	ill	advised.	Mountain	air	is	good	for	you, but	 the	 mountains	 will	 do	 you	 more	 good	 if	 you	 simply	 look	 at	 them.	 If	 you think	you	must	go	to	the	top,	take	a	burro.	You	will	find	that	the	burro	will	give you	a	lesson	in	how	to	do	things	in	a	leisurely	way.	Do	not	get	out	of	patience with	 him	 and	 whip	 him.	 Remember	 that	 the	 burro	 is	 smarter	 than	 you	 are	 in regard	 to	 the	 business	 of	 mountain	 climbing.	 He	 has	 never	 had	 a	 nervous breakdown,	and	if	you	will	let	him	have	his	own	way	he	never	will	have.	It	will do	you	good	to	let	him	have	his	way;	he	affords	a	tremendous	lesson	in	patience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Patience,	that's	just	what	we	need,	and	we	need	it	badly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walking	 slowly	 in	 the	 open	 air	 for	 two	 or	 three	 hours	 is	 the	 best	 exercise	 for man.	Fortunately,	like	the	water	we	drink,	it	is	free	to	the	poor	as	well	as	the	rich. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	the	 nervous	 man	who	 is	 able	to	 do	 it,	 I	know	 of	 nothing	better	 to	 build	up muscles	and	keep	the	liver	and	other	internal	organs	in	good	shape	than	sawing wood.	Don't	scorn	this	sort	of	exercise	because	you	have	been	told	that	the	ex-Kaiser	is	taking	it.	That	is	not	to	be	laid	up	against	the	wood	or	the	exercise,	for, quite	fortunately,	the	wood	does	not	care	who	saws	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Get	some	wood,	then,	and	a	buck	saw,	and	saw	wood	for	your	own	benefit.	You can	do	this	morning	and	evening.	Wood	sawing	brings	into	play	every	muscle	in the	 body,	 and	 the	 exercise	 is	 just	 enough	 to	 make	 a	 man	 comfortably	 tired without	doing	him	harm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many	 people	 who	 go	 to	 sanitariums	 for	 a	 cure	 pay	 from	 fifty	 to	 seventy-five dollars	per	week	for	the	privilege	of	sawing	wood,	and	you	can	take	this	exercise just	 as	 well	 and	 at	 considerably	 less	 expense	 at	 home,	 sawing	 your	 own	 wood instead	of	that	of	the	sanitarium. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	splendid	diversion	for	a	man	with	"nerves,"	if	he	can	have	it,	is	a	small workshop	where	he	can	make	just	any	old	thing	out	of	boards	and	nails.	If	one	is apt	in	this	line,	he	can	make	things	that	will	interest	children.	This	sort	of	work requires	 a	 certain	 kind	 of	 concentration	 that	 is	 most	 excellent	 for	 the	 nervous sufferer.	This	suggestion	would	of	course	apply	to	a	woman,	too,	if	she	cared	to try	such	an	experiment.	Sewing,	and	especially	fine	needlework,	is	very	trying	to a	 woman's	 nerves,	 and	 if	 she	 has	 broken	 down	 under	 that	 kind	 of	 work	 she should	quit	it	and	do	something	else.	If	she	has	to	make	her	living	in	that	way, she	of	all	people	should	observe	the	outdoor	rules	as	well	as	rules	for	dieting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	am	sure	nervous	people	profit	by	frequenting	all	possible	outdoor	games.	If	a number	of	people	afflicted	with	"nerves"	could	get	together	and	take	daily	walks</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>and	 at	 the	 same	 time	 determine	 that	 their	 conversation	 should	 always	 have	 a humorous	slant,	it	would	help	all	of	them	wonderfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riding	 in	 an	 automobile	 is	 beneficial	 if	 the	 machine	 is	 driven	 slowly	 and	 the patient	is	kept	out	of	doors	from	three	to	four	hours.	But	the	fast	driving	that	is generally	done	is	bad	for	these	people.	They	come	back	from	a	ride	worse	than when	they	started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	may	be	set	down	as	a	general	rule	that	any	form	of	outdoor	exercise	or	play	is good	for	the	nervous	person	if	it	is	not	violent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nervous	people	should,	if	possible,	take	a	vacation	once	a	year	and	get	into	new surroundings.	I	am	certain,	however,	that	it	does	not	make	any	difference	where one	lives.	A	man	is	just	as	likely	to	have	a	breakdown	in	one	part	of	the	world	as another.	 While	 on	 these	 vacations	 he	 should	 stick	 to	 his	 rules	 just	 as	 rigidly	 as when	he	is	at	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 have	 had	 letters	 from	 people	 in	 Canada	 and	 from	 others	 in	 Florida	 who	 have suffered	nervous	breakdowns.	In	California	some	go	to	pieces.	I	have	had	many letters	from	people	living	there	who	have	broken	down.	People	also	break	down in	Colorado	and	in	New	York;	in	fact,	in	every	state	in	the	Union.	Climate	does not	 seem	 to	 make	 any	 difference	 so	 far	 as	 this	 trouble	 is	 concerned,	 with	 the exception	that	in	high	altitudes	I	have	observed	nervous	people	are	inclined	to	be more	 restless	 than	 elsewhere.	 Some	 years	 ago	 I	 went	 up	 Pike's	 Peak,	 to	 the Summit	House.	I	went	to	bed	and	spent	the	night	there,	but	I	do	not	say	I	slept, for	in	reality	I	slept	only	about	half	an	hour.	I	was	not	at	all	sick	at	the	stomach, as	so	many	are	who	climb	up	there;	I	had	prevented	this	by	eating	a	very	light breakfast	and	chewing	my	food	to	a	cream.	But	I	was	extremely	nervous.	I	have found	a	great	many	other	nervous	people	who	do	not	feel	quite	right	when	in	a high	 altitude.	 As	 a	 general	 rule,	 sea	 level	 is	 as	 good	 a	 place	 as	 a	 nervous individual	can	find	to	live.	But	people	break	down	there,	too.	The	diet,	you	see, is	 the	 big	 thing.	 And	 when	 I	 say	 "diet"	 I	 mean	 the	 way	 food	 is	 eaten	 and	 the amount	eaten	quite	as	much	as	I	do	the	kind	of	food	eaten. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 once	 more	 let	 me	 say,	 systematic	 outdoor	 exercise	 also	 counts,	 and	 you can't	keep	fit	if	you	exercise	only	one,	two,	or	three	days	a	week.	Some	people who	take	long	walks	in	the	country	on	Sunday	think	that	will	suffice.	But	it	will not.	You	must	have	exercise	every	day	and	must	have	some	play	along	with	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gymnasium	work	is	of	very	little	value	as	compared	to	outdoor	exercise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	summertime,	gardening	is	a	splendid	form	of	exercise.	And	so	is	the	care</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>of	 a	 small	 flock	 of	 chickens,	 which	 is	 possible	 for	 those	 living	 in	 the	 smaller towns.	 It	 is	 always	 better,	 when	 taking	 outdoor	 exercise,	 to	 have	 something definite	to	do.	When	walking	it	is	a	good	plan,	if	you	can,	to	have	some	definite place	to	go.	And	if	you	have	an	agreeable	companion	to	keep	up	a	rapid-fire	talk, that	will	help	also.	All	these	things	are	mentally	stimulating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	if	possible,	sleep	the	year	round	on	a	sleeping	porch.	If	you	don't	possess	a porch,	 then,	 have	 all	 the	 windows	 in	 your	 sleeping	 room	 wide	 open	 day	 and night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	for	 a	 time	you	 have	 to	take	 physic,	 it	 is	best	 to	 take	some	 hot	 mineral	 water half	 an	 hour	 before	 breakfast.	 But	 adhering	 to	 dieting	 and	 exercise,	 and	 eating enough	apples,	usually	overcomes	constipation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now,	 there	 are	 some	 things	 about	 which	 a	 person	 must	 use	 his	 own	 good judgment.	 For	 instance,	 if	 you	 have	 any	 bad	 teeth	 you	 should	 at	 once	 go	 to	 a good	dentist	and	have	them	attended	to.	Nobody	with	bad	teeth	can	have	good health. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again,	if	your	tonsils	have	become	mere	pus	sacs	you	will	have	to	go	to	a	good nose	and	throat	specialist	and	have	them	removed	before	you	can	expect	to	have good	health.	This,	however,	applies	to	all	people,	whether	nervous	or	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 same	 thing	 is	 true	 with	 regard	 to	 your	 eyes.	 If	 you	 are	 suffering	 from	 eye strain	 because	 you	 need	 glasses,	 you	 cannot	 hope	 to	 get	 well	 of	 "nerves"	 until your	eyes	are	properly	fitted	to	glasses	by	some	reliable	eye	specialist.	These	are things	that	each	individual	must	discover	and	do	for	himself.	He	should	consult	a dentist,	an	oculist,	an	aurist,	or	other	specialist	according	to	his	particular	need. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A	very	sad	thing	about	some	nervous	people	is	the	fact	that	in	their	lives	there are	domestic	or	other	troubles	which	no	physician	can	overcome.	Some	of	them live	in	depressing	surroundings,	but	for	all	these	there	is	hope.	There	is	no	doubt that	if	we	can	restore	the	brain	to	a	perfectly	normal,	healthful	state	the	human being	 can	 bear	 more	 suffering	 than	 when	 the	 brain	 is	 affected.	 Perhaps	 when speaking	 of	 the	 spirit	 we	 had	 better	 call	 it	 that,	 rather	 than	 the	 brain,	 for	 that mysterious	 something	 we	 call	 spirit	 does	 make	 its	 home	 in	 the	 brain	 of	 man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	has	been	proven	scientifically.	So	then,	in	this	life	the	temple	of	the	spirit, or	soul,	does	affect	the	mind.	And	when	I	say	this	life,	I	take	the	opportunity	to say	here	that	I	not	only	believe	in	the	immortality	of	the	soul,	but	now,	at	45,	I am	as	certain	of	it	as	I	am	of	my	own	existence.	But	for	some	reason—although as	yet	no	one	understands	why	it	should	do	so—when	this	temple	in	which	the spirit	dwells	is	out	of	condition,	it	affects	the	soul	or	spirit.	So,	you	see,	if	we	can make	the	physical	man	or	woman	well,	we	most	certainly	can	help	the	spirit	that dwells	within	the	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	so	I	recommend	dieting,	temperance	in	eating,	and	the	careful	chewing	of food	to	all	those	sufferers	who	unfortunately	live	in	depressing	surroundings	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>cannot	 get	 away	 from	 them.	 When	 referring	 to	 the	 many	 pitiful	 letters	 I	 have received	 from	 poor	 human	 beings	 thus	 situated,	 I	 realize	 that	 I	 am	 treading	 on sacred	 ground.	 Such	 things	 are	 written,	 of	 course,	 to	 a	 physician	 in	 confidence and	the	confidence	must	therefore	be	forever	sacred.	I	have	not	only	had	letters from	 these	 unfortunate	 people,	 but	 have	 repeatedly	 come	 in	 contact	 with	 many of	them	in	their	every	day	life.	I	know	well	what	added	suffering	such	conditions bring	to	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 know	 of	 nothing	 in	 this	 world	 more	 pitiful	 than	 a	 noble,	 high-spirited, ambitious	woman,	pure	and	clean	of	heart,	who	marries	a	man	and	becomes	the mother	of	his	children	and	is	then	condemned	to	live	the	life	of	a	mere	animal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	all	too	frequently	the	opposite	also	obtains.	Sometimes	a	man	of	high,	pure purpose	finds	that	he	has	chosen	as	the	mother	of	his	children	a	coarse,	sensual woman.	 Now	 why	 in	 the	 world	 were	 these	 two	 people	 attracted	 to	 each	 other? </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	is	one	of	life's	biggest	puzzles	to	those	who	have	thought	much	along	this line.	In	many	instances	extreme	youth	is	the	reason	given.	While	youth	is	mating time,	it	also	is	the	time	of	bad	judgment.	Thousands	of	young	people	have	made this	dreadful	mistake	simply	because	they	married	too	young.	On	the	other	hand, youth	is	not	altogether	to	blame.	When	people,	young	or	old,	are	courting,	each individual	endeavors	to	appear	at	his	or	her	best	before	the	other.	Without	being actually	 aware	 of	 it,	 under	 such	 circumstances	 both	 man	 and	 woman	 are	 doing all	that	lies	in	their	power	to	deceive	one	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 people	 would	 do	 their	 courting	 in	 everyday	 clothes,	 and	 if	 the	 girl	 would	 go about	 her	 housework	 while	 the	 man	 looked	 on,	 or	 better	 still,	 if	 he	 helped	 her with	it	for	one	or	two	years,	they	would	undoubtedly	become	better	acquainted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But,	 after	 all,	 except,	 perhaps,	 in	 unusual	 cases,	 there	 is	 absolutely	 nothing	 by which	 people	 know	 that	 they	 are	 going	 to	 be	 properly	 mated.	 If	 a	 man	 with	 a tendency	 to	 neurasthenia	 breaks	 down	 and	 is	 tied	 to	 a	 nagging	 wife,	 that	 is usually	the	last	straw	in	the	way	of	his	recovery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	is	just	as	true	of	the	woman	who	breaks	down	and	has	a	nagging	husband. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 are,	 I	 regret	 to	 say,	 thousands	 of	 such	 cases	 all	 over	 the	 country.	 On	 the other	 hand	 I	 have	 had	 a	 man	 come	 to	 me	 and	 say	 that	 he	 was	 willing	 to	 do anything	on	earth	to	aid	his	wife,	but	he	could	not	get	her	to	diet	or	even	to	make a	 serious	 attempt	 to	 get	 well.	 I	 am	 always	 tremendously	 sorry	 for	 such	 a	 man because	he	has	a	mighty	heavy	burden	to	bear.	Such	a	wife	should	try	to	get	well as	 much	 for	 the	 man's	 sake	 as	 for	 her	 own.	 She	 should	 understand	 that	 she	 is needlessly	torturing	the	one	best	friend	she	has	on	earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>A	 woman	 of	 this	 kind	 should	 remember	 that,	 no	 matter	 how	 much	 she	 may suffer,	she	is	hopelessly	selfish	if	she	will	not	do	all	in	her	power	to	diet	and	to obey	 other	 necessary	 rules	 that	 will	 enable	 her	 to	 get	 rid	 of	 the	 malady. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes	when	a	physician	puts	this	before	her	kindly	but	firmly	it	results	in her	 making	 a	 beginning	 and	 by	 and	 by	 getting	 well.	 I	 have	 seen	 this	 happen many	 times.	 And	 I	 wish	 to	 say	 right	 here	 that	 while	 I	 believe	 I	 was	 born	 with some	natural	tact,	yet	if	I	had	not	gone	through	all	this	horrible	suffering	myself I	should	not,	I	know,	be	able	to	say	the	things	that	would	induce	these	people	to do	that	which	it	is	their	duty	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	here	is	one	big	difficulty	I	have	always	had	to	contend	with.	Some	of	these people	 have	 tried	 so	 many	 so-called	 nonsense	 cures—eating	 buttermilk	 tablets, for	instance—and	have	had	no	benefit	from	them,	that	they	are	unwilling	to	try the	one	and	only	thing	that	will	cure	them—the	thing	that	will	cure	them	as	sure as	 the	 sun	 shines.	 I	 wonder	 why	 it	 is	 that	 since	 the	 time	 of	 Christ	 people	 are always	 looking	 for	 a	 sensational	 or	 miraculous	 cure.	 Our	 life	 and	 everything pertaining	to	it	is	miracle	enough,	if	we	only	had	the	sense	to	see	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	or	the	man	with	"nerves"	is	not	going	to	get	well	eating	buttermilk tablets	 or	 taking	 patent	 dope	 while	 lying	 on	 a	 couch	 and	 shut	 in	 a	 house.	 You must	 bestir	 yourself.	 You	 must	 get	 out	 of	 doors,	 and	 above	 all,	 you	 must	 eat right.	 Today	 thousands	 of	 these	 people	 are	 languishing	 in	 hospitals	 and sanitariums,	 and	 most	 of	 them	 will	 come	 out	 only	 to	 go	 back	 again	 and	 again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 institutional	 treatment	 is	 good	 for	 the	 beginning	 of	 the	 cure,	 but	 if	 an individual	 with	 "nerves"	 is	 going	 to	 get	 well	 and	 stay	 well	 he	 must	 change	 his lifelong	habits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 I	 want	 to	 say	 again,	 that	 any	 person,	 man	 or	 woman,	 in	 the	 midst	 of depressing	conditions	can	triumph	over	them	if	he	will	eat	as	he	should	and	live as	he	should.	There	is	something	about	the	human	soul,	if	it	is	pure	and	fine,	and if	proper	attention	is	given	to	right	living,	that	will	enable	a	person	to	meet	great sorrow	 and	 triumph	 over	 it.	 In	 fact,	 no	 amount	 of	 sorrow	 can	 defeat	 a	 person who	keeps	his	heart	and	body	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	I	would	have	you	all	realize	that	there	is	something	far	more	to	us	than	mere bones	 and	 veins	 and	 nerves.	 I	 know	 the	 terrible	 tendency	 of	 the	 one	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">"nerves"	 to	 get	 angry.	 But	 lay	 fast	 hold	 of	 yourself.	 Fight	 anger	 as	 you	 would poison,	because	in	reality	it	is	poison	to	your	nerves.	Anger	will	hurt	you;	it	will hurt	 anybody.	 But	 no	 matter	 how	 hard	 you	 find	 it	 at	 first,	 get	 control	 of	 your temper.	 If	 you	 succeed	 in	 doing	 this	 in	 a	 year	 you	 will	 have	 won	 one	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>greatest	 victories	 man	 can	 win	 in	 this	 world.	 I	 would	 rather	 meet	 a	 so-called plain	man	who	has	perfect	control	over	his	physical	and	mental	faculties,	and	sit and	 talk	 quietly	 with	 him,	 than	 to	 meet	 the	 Prime	 Minister	 of	 England	 or	 the President	of	the	United	States	if	either	lacked	this	control.	For	I	say	to	you	that no	matter	what	others	may	say,	the	true	measure	of	success	does	not	rest	in	the position	you	occupy	but	in	your	having	complete	control	of	yourself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 you	 are	 to	 gain	 this	 control	 it	 means	 that	 each	 day	 you	 are	 confronted	 by	 a mighty	 big	 task,	 but	 if	 finally	 successful,	 you	 will	 have	 accomplished	 the greatest	thing	a	man	can	do	in	this	life.	Now,	here	is	something	for	you	to	take hold	of,	you	who	all	these	years	have	believed	that	your	life	ambition	has	been thwarted.	But	your	ambition,	let	me	tell	you,	has	not	been	thwarted.	Perhaps	you have	not	done	just	what	you	wanted	to	do.	But	it's	quite	possible	that	you	had	no business	trying	to	do	that	special	thing	anyway.	Most	of	us,	I	find,	can	be	greatly mistaken	about	what	we	think	we	want	to	do.	At	any	rate,	we	can	never	be	happy unless	we	gain	entire	control	of	ourselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	is	something	the	person	afflicted	with	"nerves"	most	certainly	can	do,	 and he	can	use	this	terrible	"thing"	as	I	myself	and	thousands	of	others	have	used	it as	 a	 ladder	 to	 climb	 to	 the	 sunlit	 peaks	 where	 worry	 and	 clouds	 and	 storms cannot	trouble.	And,	after	all,	no	matter	who	we	are,	no	matter	how	poor	or	how rich	 we	 are,	 and	 no	 matter	 where	 we	 live,	 life	 holds	 about	 the	 same	 general possibilities	 for	 all	 of	 us.	 I	 mean	 by	 this	 that	 life	 affords	 to	 all	 the	 same opportunities	for	real	happiness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	know	very	well	that	there	are	those	who	will	be	quite	unwilling	to	grant	this, but	it	is	as	true	as	the	life	we	live.	Many	people	in	this	old	world	still	hold	the notion	 that	 those	 who	 roll	 in	 wealth	 are	 the	 happy	 ones.	 But	 I	 say	 to	 you	 this notion	is	all	wrong,	and	from	knowledge	gained	through	experience	I	know	that in	 their	 hearts	 many	 of	 these	 wealthy	 people	 are	 dissatisfied	 and	 not	 one	 whit happier	than	you	are.	The	most	restless	people,	the	most	unhappy	people,	and	the most	thoroughly	dissatisfied	people	that	I	have	ever	met	have	been	people	who had	everything	that	riches	could	give	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Andrew	Carnegie	said	he	had	noticed	that	after	a	man	had	accumulated	a	million dollars	 smiles	 were	 seldom	 seen	 on	 his	 face.	 I	 cannot	 understand	 why	 people insist	 on	 going	 through	 life	 making	 themselves	 and	 all	 those	 they	 really	 love miserable	just	because	they	do	not	happen	to	have	riches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	a	great	many	high-strung	sensitive	men	are	utterly	cast	down	because	they</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>have	failed	to	acquire	wealth	by	the	time	they	are	forty-five	or	fifty	years	of	age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 wish	 I	 could	 make	 all	 such	 poor,	 afflicted	 people	 see	 what	 goes	 to	 make	 up happiness	and	learn	the	only	way	to	be	happy.	In	order	to	get	well	the	thing	we have	to	do	is	to	follow	nature's	simple	rules—rules	our	Creator	gave	to	us.	We must	get	control	not	only	of	our	appetites	but	of	all	such	passions	as	anger,	hate, and	 envy,	 which	 poison	 our	 bodies.	 And	 let	 us	 also	 cast	 suspicion	 out	 of	 our minds.	This	is	a	good	rule	to	observe:	Never	suspect	folks.	It	is	useless,	anyway, for	 by	 and	 by	 what	 they	 are	 or	 what	 they	 do	 is	 always	 bound	 to	 come	 to	 the surface. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	 gaining	 perfect	 control	 over	 yourself—and	 most	 certainly	 to	 do	 so	 is	 worth every	effort	you	may	make—you	will	also	gain	patience,	and	that	is,	I	think,	one of	the	crowning	virtues.	Sometimes	I	think	it	the	greatest	of	all	virtues.	Certainly it	stands	very	high	in	the	perfecting	of	character. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	the	sufferer	with	"nerves"	I	would	say:	Have	the	courage	to	believe	that	you are	 going	 to	 get	 well.	 Then	 you	 can	 do	 it.	 No	 matter	 how	 depressing	 or discouraging	 your	 surroundings,	 do	 the	 very	 best	 you	 can	 every	 day.	 Then,	 no matter	 what	 your	 ideas	 of	 success	 may	 have	 been,	 you	 are	 really	 succeeding wonderfully!	See	that	you	keep	right	on	doing	it!	If	you	are	a	mother	and	have children,	 live	 for	 them.	 Or	 if	 you	 are	 a	 father	 and	 have	 children,	 and	 have	 met with	 disappointments,	 live	 for	 those	 children!	 Do	 everything	 in	 your	 power	 to make	them	happy,	high	of	heart,	and	gallant	of	soul.	Do	not	live	for	yourself,	live for	 your	 children.	 If	 you	 have	 no	 children	 of	 your	 own,	 look	 about	 and	 get interested	 in	 some	 other	 person's	 children.	 You	 will	 find	 a	 lot	 of	 children	 all around	 you—blessed	 little	 beings—that	 you	 can	 help	 to	 make	 happy.	 Get	 your mind	off	yourself	and	your	troubles	and	on	the	children	of	this	world,	and	keep	it there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	you	were	a	child	no	doubt	you	had	many	happy	days.	Some	of	us	had	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	 happy	 childhood,	 while	 others	 may	 have	 been	 denied	 what	 their	 hearts desired.	But	if	we	did	not	have	a	happy	childhood	that	is	all	the	more	reason	why we	 should	 be	 glad	 to	 help	 some	 other	 little	 ones	 have	 a	 happy	 one.	 More	 and more	 each	 year	 I	 live	 I	 come	 to	 believe	 that	 it	 depends	 entirely	 upon	 grown people	whether	in	this	world	children	are	happy	or	not	happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 you	 had	 a	 happy	 childhood—and	 most	 people	 had—do	 you	 not	 recall	 the glorious	 times	 you	 had?	 I	 know	 you	 do,	 for	 we	 all	 do.	 And	 I	 know,	 too,	 how much	people	affected	with	nerves	dwell	on	those	memories,	and	how	much	they</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>wish	they	might	go	back	to	those	blessed	days	when	the	sun	was	always	shining and	 the	 birds	 were	 always	 singing	 and	 the	 streams	 always	 beckoning	 them	 to play	along	their	sands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Do	 you	 realize	 that	 you	 can	 live	 in	 those	 days	 again?	 I	 do,	 and	 I	 go	 back	 and dwell	in	them	more	and	more	the	older	I	get.	I	do	not	mean	that	I	am	not	looking forward,	for	I	am,	tremendously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	stupid	we	poor	miserable	creatures	of	this	world	become	after	we	leave	our childhood	days	behind	us!	We	really	should	never	lose	sight	of	them.	I	have	said that	 the	 person	 afflicted	 with	 "nerves"	 should	 not	 run.	 I	 did	 not	 quite	 mean	 all that	implies.	After	such	a	man	has	recovered,	if	he	has	a	good	heart,	he	should run	a	little.	I	run;	I	can't	help	it.	I	feel	so	good	I	have	to	run	a	little	now	and	then to	work	off	steam.	But	you	know	very	well	when	most	people	see	a	man	running they	at	once	think	a	house	is	afire	somewhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 is	 almost	 unbelievable	 that	 we	 should	 actually	 surround	 ourselves	 with	 so many	utterly	senseless	customs	that	tend	to	nothing	but	misery	and	unhappiness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 should	 dress	 for	 comfort,	 and	 we	 should	 have	 the	 courage	 to	 live	 in	 a youthful	world	where	all	may	be	happy.	"If	the	blind	lead	the	blind,"	so	the	Bible tells	us,	"both	shall	fall	into	the	ditch."	We	need	so	to	live	and	act	that	we	shall not	fail	to	be	happy.	Happiness	really	is	what	everybody	is	chasing,	but	how	very far	 away	 from	 it	 most	 people	 are	 getting!	 Go	 back	 to	 the	 memories	 of	 your childhood.	Be	with	children	and	play	with	them	all	you	possibly	can.	If	you	are	a mother,	 begin	 this	 very	 day	 to	 exercise	 more	 patience	 with	 your	 children, recalling	over	and	over	again	that	when	you	were	a	child	you	were	just	as	they are.	And	remember,	for	it	is	only	too	true,	that	the	day	is	fast	coming	when	your little	 boy	 will	 no	 longer	 be	 a	 little	 boy,	 he	 will	 be	 a	 man,	 and	 will	 have	 gone away	 from	 you.	 Then	 many	 times	 you	 will	 wish	 him	 back,	 and	 you	 will	 look back	on	those	days	when	you	thought	your	nerves	were	being	ruined,	and	feel	a great	 swelling	 in	 your	 breast,	 and	 breathing	 a	 sigh,	 whisper	 to	 yourself,	 "Dear God,	I	hope	I	did	all	I	ought	to	have	done	for	him	while	he	was	little." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	know	that	any	one	can	live	with	children	and	find	happiness	in	being	one	with them,	and	I	know	of	no	better	thing	to	do.	After	we	have	hold	of	ourselves	with	a firm	grip	we	should	endeavor	to	do	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	have	had	people	suffering	with	"nerves"	tell	me	they	had	lost	a	little	boy	or	a little	girl,	and	that	it	seems	impossible	to	get	over	this	loss.	I	cannot	tell	you	how much	I	long	to	help	such	people.	But	I	always	urge	them	to	go	right	on	playing</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>with	other	children	and	to	remember,	for	to	me	it	is	certain	truth,	that	they	will meet	 that	 little	 child	 again.	 There	 should	 be	 nothing	 to	 grieve	 about	 in	 such	 a loss.	To	find	compensation,	the	one	who	has	had	such	a	grief	has	only	to	keep	on playing	the	part	of	a	true	man	or	true	woman.	Childhood	with	all	its	pains	and pleasures	 is	 everywhere	 about	 us.	 And	 childhood	 is	 only	 the	 beginning	 of immortality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Late	 one	 night,	 a	 number	 of	 years	 ago,	 I	 was	 sitting	 in	 a	 little	 restaurant	 in	 a western	 town,	 and	 was	 feeling	 very	 lonely	 and	 miserable.	 Sorrow	 weighed heavily	upon	me	that	night	and	the	world	never	seemed	blacker,	yet	I	think	my belief	 in	 the	 immortality	 of	 the	 soul	 had	 never	 been	 more	 certain.	 I	 looked	 up and	 high	 on	 the	 smoke-stained	 wall	 hung	 a	 painted	 picture	 of	 an	 old-time	 ship with	many	sails	set.	This	painting	pictured	the	ship	sailing	through	the	darkness of	 night.	 But	 through	 the	 dark,	 seemingly	 restless	 clouds	 the	 moon	 gleamed brightly	on	the	white	canvas	of	the	sails. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	never	before	been	so	powerfully	impressed	by	any	picture.	It	seemed	fairly to	 speak	 to	 me.	 I	 took	 an	 envelope	 from	 my	 pocket	 and	 set	 down	 the	 verses given	here.	These	verses	were	afterwards	published	in	one	or	two	metropolitan papers.	 Mr.	 James	 Bryce,	 then	 English	 Ambassador	 at	 Washington,	 saw	 them and	wrote	me	a	beautiful	letter	about	them,	in	which	he	said,	"Your	little	poem</p>
<p class="calibre1">'The	 Last	 Journey'	 attracts	 me	 very	 much."	 You	 see	 he	 was	 beginning	 to	 grow old,	and	I	knew	that	was	the	reason	these	lines	of	mine	had	made	an	appeal	to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	very	long	after	this	I	also	had	a	letter	about	the	verses	from	Dr.	Osler,	then Regius	 Professor	 of	 Medicine	 at	 Oxford.	 In	 it	 he	 said,	 "I	 have	 read	 your	 little poem	'The	Last	Journey'	with	unusual	interest."	And	again	I	knew	why.	You	see, it	 does	 not	 matter	 very	 much	 what	 our	 rank	 or	 our	 station	 here,	 no	 matter whether	a	human	being	is	a	king	or	what	his	station	in	life	may	be,	he	still	is	a human	being.	We	are	all	reaching	out	after	the	same	great	thing.	The	fine	thing about	 the	 sentiment	 of	 these	 little	 verses	 is	 that	 although	 you	 wish	 to	 and	 may not	believe	it,	it	is	coming	true	anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE	LAST	JOURNEY</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">One	night	when	in	a	youthful	dream, </p>
