<p class="calibre1">The	Way	to	the	Feast	of	Flowers</p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	a	dream,	then	a	place,	then	a	memory.	My	father	built	it	near	the Suwannee	River.	I	like	to	think	it	was	in	the	heart	of	Florida,	because it	was,	and	is,	in	my	heart.	Its	name	was	Dogland. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	people	say	you	can	know	others	if	you	know	the	central	incidents that	shaped	their	lives.	But	an	incident	is	an	island	in	time,	and	to know	the	effect	of	the	island	on	those	who	land	there,	you	must	know something	about	the	river	they	have	traveled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	I	must	warn	you	before	we	begin,	I	don't	know	that	river	well.	I visit	that	time	and	place	like	a	ghost	with	poor	vision	and	little memory.	I	look	up	the	river	and	see	fog	rolling	in.	I	look	down	the river,	and	the	brightness	of	the	approaching	day	blinds	me.	I	see	shapes moving	behind	me	and	beyond	me,	but	who	they	are	and	what	they	do,	I cannot	say.	I	will	tell	what	I	know	is	true,	and	I	will	invent	what	I believe	is	true,	and	that,	I	think,	is	all	you	can	ask	any	storyteller</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p4"></a>to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	learned	the	Nix	family	history	from	the	stories	Pa	told.	Even	at	the age	of	four,	I	suspected	that	Pa's	stories	might	not	be	perfectly	true. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Pa	said	we	Nixes	came	to	North	America	as	indentured	servants working	our	way	out	of	debtor's	prison,	Grandma	Bette	would	make	a	face and	say	he	couldn't	know	that.	When	he	said	we	Nixes	had	Lakota	and Ojibwe	blood	in	our	veins,	Grandma	Bette	would	say	she	wasn't prejudiced,	but	it	simply	wasn't	so:	she	and	Pa	and	his	brothers	and sisters	were	dark	because	her	people	were	Black	Dutch,	from	a	part	of Holland	where	everyone	had	black	hair	and	black	eyes.	And	then	Grandma Bette	wouldn't	say	a	word	for	half	an	hour	or	more,	a	very	long	time	for Grandma	Bette	to	be	quiet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	usually	told	the	family	stories	when	driving	to	the	store	with	Little Bit	and	me,	while	Ma	stayed	home	with	Digger.	Little	Bit	would	sit	on the	front	seat	of	the	station	wagon	with	Pa,	and	I	would	stand	in	back, straddling	the	transmission	hump	with	my	arms	wrapped	over	the	front seat.	After	awhile,	Little	Bit	or	I	would	ask	for	the	Little	Big	Horn story,	or	the	Light-horse	Harry	Lee	story,	or	another	of	the	Nix	family histories,	like:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tell	us	'bout	that	bad	man." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	bad	man	is	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p5"></a>"Our	great-great-great-great-great-great	grampa!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	a	lot	of	greats." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Bout	the	bad	man!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	mean	the	horse	thief?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No."	The	horse	thief	story	was	hardly	a	story	at	all.	A	Nix	was	caught for	stealing	horses	and	hung,	that	was	all.	Pa	only	told	that	story	when Grandma	Bette	was	visiting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Bout	the	bad	man." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In	jail." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"An'	the	train." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"An'	the	man	ran	off	with	his	wife." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	story!	Tell	us	that	story." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tell	us	that	story.	Please?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pretty	please.	Pretty	please	tell	us	that	story." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	there's	not	much	to	tell." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Please,	Pa!	Please,	please,	please!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	okay.	There	was	this	man--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	Nix." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--a	Nix."	Probably	a	farmer.	Most	forgotten	Nixes	were	probably farmers.	"And	some	fellow	ran	away	with	his	wife."	The	farmer	was	old, forty-five	or	fifty,	with	stubbly,	hollowed	cheeks	and	staring	eyes.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p6"></a>wore	overalls.	His	wife	was	young,	barely	twenty,	pretty	and	plump	and blond.	The	other	man,	a	lanky	salesman	with	clean-scrubbed	skin,	was from	the	city.	He	wore	a	nice	suit	and	had	a	shy	smile,	and	he	parted his	hair	in	the	middle.	"They	were	on	a	train.	They	thought	they'd gotten	away." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	they	hadn't,	had	they,	Pa!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	they	hadn't."	The	couple	sat	side	by	side	in	the	train.	The wife-stealer	sat	by	the	aisle	with	his	hat	in	his	lap.	He	wore	a	green plaid	suit,	and	he	kept	twisting	the	hat,	a	derby,	with	his	smooth, clean	fingers.	He	grinned	his	shy	smile	while	staring	happily	into	the eyes	of	the	woman.	She'd	glance	at	him,	glance	away,	then	glance	back, then	glance	away	again.	She	was	nervous,	not	afraid	that	her	husband would	find	her	but	merely	embarrassed	to	be	so	obviously	the	object	of the	young	man's	love.	She	feared	he	expected	too	much	of	her	and	would be	disappointed	once	they'd	lived	together.	She	loved	him	as	much	as	he loved	her,	and	she	could	not	believe	two	people	could	be	so	perfectly created	for	each	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	caught	up	with	them,	didn't	he,	Pa?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Right	in	the	train,	right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	right."	The	passenger	car's	interior	was	like	the	train	in	The Man	Who	Shot	Liberty	Valance,	only	in	color:	seats	of	plush	green</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a>velvet,	heavy	drapes	by	the	windows,	walls	paneled	in	red	oak.	Happy people	in	Sunday	clothes	waited	to	depart.	Men	had	moustaches	that waggled	in	easy	grins	above	their	cigars.	Women	carried	parasols	and wore	long	dresses.	The	conductor	looked	like	Captain	Kangaroo	with	his plump	belly	and	his	white	walrus	moustache.	He	talked	to	a	tiny	old woman	with	sugar-white	hair	coiled	on	her	head	who	wore	square wire-rimmed	glasses	with	lenses	no	bigger	than	cough	drops,	and	no	less thick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	managed	to	follow	them.	Left	his	farm	as	if	he	didn't	plan	to	come back.	Came	after	them	with	a	Bible	and	a	shotgun." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oooh." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	caught	up	with	them	on	the	train."	The	conductor	felt	someone	brush by	him,	saw	someone	dressed	wrong	for	traveling	by	train.	He	turned	away from	the	old	woman,	called,	Hey,	you!	The	man,	the	Nix,	my	ancestor, stopped	to	look	back.	The	conductor	stared	at	him.	The	old	Nix	wore	a stiff	black	jacket	over	faded	overalls.	He	carried	a	shotgun	at	his side.	The	conductor	said,	You	can't	bring	that	gun	in	here.	The	old	man looked	at	the	conductor,	looked	at	the	shotgun,	looked	back	at	the conductor,	said,	It's	for	hunting.	He	walked	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	young	couple	did	not	see	or	hear	the	old	Nix.	The	other	people	in the	car	did	not	notice	the	old	Nix.	He	was	an	eccentric	farmer,	nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>more.	The	old	man	walked	up	behind	the	couple	and	called	the	young	man's name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	young	man	in	the	plaid	suit	turned;	he	had	never	seen	his	beloved's husband.	He	said,	Yes?	Beside	him,	the	young	woman	turned,	too.	She raised	her	hand	to	her	mouth,	but	in	that	moment,	no	words	could	come from	her	lips.	The	old	man	never	looked	at	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	said,	'You	sure	you're	so-and-so?'	asking	the	fellow's	name	again	to be	safe." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	young	man	smiled	as	he	nodded.	The	young	woman	spoke	a	word	then, perhaps	the	young	man's	name,	perhaps	my	ancestor's.	As	the	young	man looked	toward	her,	the	old	man	raised	the	gun--</p>
<p class="calibre1">"--blew	the	man's	brains	out,	right	there	in	the	train." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	shotgun's	explosion	was	loud,	but	the	young	woman's	scream	may	have been	louder.	The	old	woman	covered	her	wrinkled	mouth	with	a	white	lace glove.	The	conductor's	eyelids	opened	wide	as	if	he	could	not	get	enough light	to	his	pupils	to	see	what	had	really	happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	what?	Huh,	Pa?	Then	what?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothing,	really.	They	locked	him	up.	He	didn't	try	to	get	away	or anything.	He'd	done	what	he	had	to	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"An'	then?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	hung	himself	in	the	jail	cell."	The	old	man	dangled	from	his	belt	(I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>never	wondered	why	my	ancestor	wore	both	overalls	and	a	belt)	which	had become	long	enough	to	tie	to	a	convenient	wooden	beam.	The	walls	of	the cell	had	been	built	with	blocks	of	gray	stone.	The	old	man	spun	slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	boots	had	holes	in	them.	Sunlight	shone	obliquely	between	the	bars of	the	single	window.	The	shadows	stretched	across	the	floor,	across	the old	man's	faded,	battered	boots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oooooh." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	learned	my	personal	history	from	Ma.	She	told	me	about	my	birth	in 1955	on	an	army	base	in	South	Carolina,	and	about	the	Mexico	trip	when everyone	smiled	at	the	happy	gringo	baby	with	curly	red	hair,	and	how proud	Pa	was.	She	told	me	that	after	they	brought	Little	Bit	home	to	the farm	in	Minnesota,	they'd	hear	her	cry	and	rush	into	the	room	to	find	me already	there,	patting	her	head	and	saying,	"Don't	cry,	baby,	don't cry."	It	took	them	several	weeks	to	realize	that	I	would	pinch	her	when we	were	alone,	then	comfort	her	as	the	adults	arrived.	That	story	always made	me	laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	liked	the	old	stories	because	they	changed	a	little	with	each	telling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes	an	old	story	inspired	a	new	one	that	I	had	never	heard,	a story	that	told	me	about	something	I	hadn't	suspected	I	hadn't	known. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	how	I	learned	about	the	drunken	man	at	the	hospital	when	I	was born. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>Ma	told	me	that	story	one	night	when	I	was	four	or	five,	soon	after	we moved	to	Florida.	I	asked,	"Ma?	D'you	'member	the	hairy	man	an'	the	tree lady	at	Mardi	Gras?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shook	her	head	and	set	aside	the	copy	of	Reader's	Digest	that	she'd been	looking	through.	"There	were	an	awful	lot	of	people	dressed	up	that day,	and	I	wasn't	really	paying	much	attention	to	any	of	them."	She	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	tree	lady	that	helped	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	nice	Negro	woman?"	Ma	smiled	and	glanced	toward	our	TV	set.	We always	had	second-hand	televisions	that	never	delivered	clear	pictures or	sound;	one	was	usually	playing	in	the	background	of	any	family conversation.	"Oh,	yes.	But	I	don't	remember	anything	about	her	and	a tree."	I	thought	Ma	wouldn't	continue,	but	then	she	said,	"It's	funny how	you	were	all	born	under	such	odd	circumstances." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	were?"	No	one	else	was	in	the	living	room.	Digger	and	Little	Bit	had to	go	to	bed	half	an	hour	before	I	did,	and	Pa	was	out	in	the	yard working	on	the	station	wagon	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	not	very	funny,"	Ma	said.	"But	having	Digger	in	the	middle	of	the Mardi	Gras	parade	is	pretty	funny."	She	smiled	and	blushed	at	the	same time,	and	so	did	I. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah."	I	laughed.	"Pretty	funny." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	on	the	day	Little	Bit	was	born,	an	entire	flock	of	quail	landed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>outside	my	room.	You	hardly	ever	see	quail	in	northern	Minnesota. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several	of	them	settled	on	my	window	sill	and	started	whistling	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doctor	Jim	said	you	could've	hunted	your	dinner	with	a	shopping	bag.	One of	the	nurses	went	to	shoo	them	away,	and	they	just	flew	around	her, a-singing	and	a-singing.	But	as	soon	as	Doctor	Jim	walked	toward	them, they	flew	off." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knew	the	punch	line	to	that	one:	"Figure	he	forgot	his	shopping	bag?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	set	her	hand	on	my	head	and	ran	her	fingers	over	the	bristles	of	my crewcut.	"I	suppose	so." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	what	about	me,	Ma?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	about	you?"	Ma	winced	the	tiniest	bit,	then	smiled.	"Oh,	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's	nothing,	really." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	funny?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	there	was	a	drunk	man	in	the	waiting	room,	saying	you	were	his boy.	I	was	afraid	Luke	would	hit	him,	but	the	orderlies	took	the	man outside." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	could	see	a	drunken	cowboy	staggering	into	a	hospital	room	wearing chaps	and	six-guns.	"What	kind	of	man?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just	some	man.	There	are	some	very	strange	people	in	this	world,	Chris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	have	to	be	careful." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes'm." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>I	couldn't	remember	the	farm	in	Minnesota	or	the	trip	down	to	New Orleans,	but	Digger's	birth	was	one	of	my	earliest	memories	and	one	of the	first	stories	that	I	could	tell,	though	it	didn't	seem	like	a	real story	to	anyone	except	me.	It	wasn't	like	the	things	that	no	one	else remembered	because	they	probably	weren't	important	to	them,	like	my earliest	memory,	of	a	day	in	the	living	room	in	Louisiana	when	the	TV</p>
<p class="calibre1">screen	suddenly	went	dark	in	the	middle	of	a	show.	A	white	dot	lingered at	its	center	as	if	the	whole	picture	had	fallen	in	on	itself,	and	then the	dot	faded	to	black.	Pa	walked	across	the	living	room	and	did something	to	the	back	of	the	set,	but	that's	where	that	memory	ends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	in	the	family	remembered	the	day	of	Digger's	birth,	even	Little Bit	and	maybe	even	Digger	himself,	but	everyone	remembered	it	a	little differently.	He	was	born	in	1958,	soon	after	my	family	came	to	New Orleans.	Pa	had	been	away	selling	encyclopedias,	and	Grandma	Letitia hadn't	come	down	to	be	with	Ma	yet	because	the	baby	wasn't	due	for	three more	weeks.	Ma	had	called	us	in	from	the	yard	and	said	that	Little	Bit and	I	would	have	to	come	with	her	in	a	taxi,	and	we'd	have	to	be	very good	and	take	care	of	her	like	she	usually	took	care	of	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	fetched	the	pink	suitcase	that	Ma	had	packed	a	month	before,	and Little	Bit	carried	Ma's	purse.	No	one	said	much.	A	neighbor	came	out	and offered	to	drive	Ma,	but	just	then	the	taxi	arrived.	The	driver,	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>red-nosed	man	who	looked	like	Santa	Claus	with	a	flat-top,	kept	saying, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	you	worry	none;	we'll	get	you	to	the	hospital	fine.	Wish	it weren't	Mardi	Gras.	Traffic's	gonna	be	hellacious.	But	don't	you	fret now,	ma'm.	We'll	get	you	there	jus'	fine,	you'll	see." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	taxi	could	not	reach	its	destination,	but	a	parade	of	costumed drunks	were	not	enough	to	stop	my	brother	from	reaching	his.	Ma	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	baby's	coming,"	and	the	driver	yelled	into	the	crowded	street, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He'p	me!	He'p	me!	A	woman's	havin'	a	child!	Somebody	he'p	me!"	Little Bit	and	I	sat	very	quietly	beside	Ma,	watching	her	breathe,	watching	the costumed	crowd,	watching	for	a	white-haired	doctor	in	a	long	white	coat with	a	gleaming	stethoscope	around	his	neck	and	a	black	leather	bag	at his	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	know	'bout	birthin'	babies,"	said	a	fat	black	woman	with	oak	leaves sticking	to	her	hair	and	her	long	green	dress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	thank	Jesus,"	said	the	taxi	driver. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	do,	too,"	said	a	scrawny,	bare-chested	white	man	with	goat	horns	at his	temples	and	shaggy	trousers	covering	his	legs.	"I	know	to	get everyone	out	of	the	way." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	sir.	That's	right.	That's	a	fine	idea."	The	driver	and	the	goat man	began	hustling	people	away	from	the	cab.	I	listened	to	Ma's breathing,	and	I	felt	myself	getting	more	and	more	scared.	Ma	smiled	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>kept	saying	it	was	okay,	but	she	was	sweating	and	red	and	gasping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	chil'en	wait	outside	the	cab,"	said	the	woman	with	oak	leaves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your	mama	won't	have	no	trouble	at	all,	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ma?"	said	Little	Bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	smiled	more	easily,	and	her	breathing	grew	deeper,	slower,	and	more even.	"Go	on,	you	two.	I	did	all	right	with	you,	didn't	I?	Stay--"	She gasped,	then	smiled	again.	"--by	the	car,	okay?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	tree	woman	glared	at	the	people	clustered	around	us.	"Y'all	turn your	backs	and	give	this	poor	woman	some	privacy,	hear!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	watchers,	white	and	black,	young	and	old,	rich	and	poor,	all	nodded and	obeyed.	In	the	middle	of	a	street	packed	tight	with	bodies,	under	a bright	midday	sun,	Ma	had	more	privacy	than	she	would	in	any	delivery	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	taxi	driver	lifted	Little	Bit	onto	the	hood	of	the	car.	They	played pattycake	while	the	Mardi	Gras	crowds	surged	around	Ma's	shielding	ring of	people.	Everyone	ignored	me,	which	comforted	me;	it	meant	there	was nothing	I	was	supposed	to	worry	about.	I	couldn't	see	Ma,	and	I	could only	see	the	back	of	the	tree	woman,	which	wasn't	that	interesting,	so	I studied	the	hairy	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every	kid	knows	about	Halloween	suits	made	of	crinkly	cloth	in	colors unknown	to	nature.	The	hair	on	the	man's	legs	was	dark	brown	and	matted with	beer	or	sweat.	His	hooves	were	muddy,	and	one	was	chipped.	His</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>horns	stuck	out	from	the	curly	hair	on	his	head,	which	was	the	color	of the	hair	covering	his	legs.	The	horns	were	small	and	dull	black	and didn't	quite	match.	He	smelled	like	a	dog	that'd	been	in	the	rain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	hairy	man	put	his	fists	on	his	flanks	and	said,	"What	you	lookin' </p>
<p class="calibre1">at,	son?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You,"	I	said,	because	Pa	had	taught	me	to	answer	adults,	and	then, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sir,"	because	Pa	had	taught	me	to	be	polite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	hairy	man	nodded,	then	belched.	I	smelled	something	like	Grandma Bette's	breath	after	she	drank	port	--	soda	pop	for	grown-ups,	only stronger.	Then	the	man	laughed.	"Think	you	see	good,	son?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	never	thought	about	how	well	I	saw.	Ma	and	Pa	both	wore	glasses, and	Little	Bit	and	I	didn't,	so	I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	hairy	man	laughed	again.	"You	ain't	seen	a	thing	till	you've	seen	it straight	on	an'	out	the	corner	of	your	eye,	both.	Near	any	fool	can	do one	or	the	other." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	an	approaching	band	broke	into	"When	the	Saints	Go	Marching	In,"	the tree	woman	said,	loud	enough	that	I	could	hear	over	the	noise	of	the parade	and	the	crowd,	"You	got	a	son,	ma'm.	A	beautiful	son,	and	he's doing	just	fine.	You	rest	easy	now,	hear?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	white	policeman	--	a	real	policeman	with	a	real	pistol	on	his	hip,	not someone	in	a	costume	--	had	joined	the	ring	of	people	standing	around</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>the	cab.	Someone	began	to	cheer,	and	others	joined	in,	even	people	far away	in	the	parade	who	couldn't	have	known	what	was	going	on.	The	cries</p>
<p class="calibre1">--	"She	had	a	son!"	and	"A	boy's	been	born!"	and	"Hallelujah!"	--</p>
<p class="calibre1">rippled	up	and	down	Bourbon	Street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	wants	her	chil'en,"	the	tree	woman	said.	A	few	leaves	fell	from	her hair	as	she	brushed	against	the	roof	of	the	cab.	One	dropped	into	my hand.	It	seemed	fresh	and	green,	as	if	the	woman	had	plucked	the finishing	touches	for	her	costume	only	minutes	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where's	her	children?"	the	policeman	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ma!"	I	yelled,	suddenly	frightened.	"Ma,	I'm	here!"	I	lunged	between the	adults'	legs,	between	hairy	legs	in	Bermuda	shorts,	smooth	legs	in dresses,	blue	trousers	that	belonged	to	the	policeman,	blue	jeans	that belonged	to	farmers,	black	cotton	trousers	that	belonged	to	jazz musicians,	baggy	red-and-white	striped	breeches	belonging	to	pirates, rough	leather	chaps	belonging	to	cowboys,	fringed	brown	trousers belonging	to	Indians,	tight	white	pedal-pushers	belonging	to	motion picture	starlets.	"I'm	here,	Ma!	I'm	here!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	tree	woman	grinned	at	me	as	she	stepped	away	from	the	open	taxi door.	Her	gold	tooth	reflected	sunlight,	and	I	was	blinded	by	the	sight of	her	and	my	mother	and	the	baby.	When	my	sight	returned,	I	saw	Ma lying	in	the	back	of	the	taxi.	Her	blue	print	dress	was	all	rumpled	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>stained,	and	the	taxi	seat	was,	too,	but	that	was	okay.	Ma	was	smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	her	arms,	she	held	a	wet	little	red	thing	that	looked	like	an	ugly puppet	or	a	shaved	monkey.	"Chris,"	Ma	said.	"Say	hello	to	your	little brother." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ma?"	I	whispered.	"You	okay,	Ma?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	fine,	Chris.	Let	Little	Bit	see,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	Ma."	As	my	sister	squeezed	past	me,	I	backed	away,	back	through the	sea	of	legs,	and	started	to	turn	to	run	as	fast	and	as	far	as	I could.	A	hand	gripped	my	shoulder,	and	I	looked	up	into	the	hairy	man's face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ugly	li'l	bastard,	ain't	he?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	hesitantly,	not	sure	whether	I	should	let	anyone	talk	that	way about	my	new	brother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	he's	beautiful,	too.	It's	tough	to	understand,	but	there	it	is. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chew	on	it	awhile,	son." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	policeman,	by	the	cab	door,	grinned	like	the	drunkest	of	the festivalers.	"Sure	is	a	handsome	li'l	fellow.	Got	a	name	for	'im,	ma'm?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We're	not	sure,"	Ma	said	gently,	which	meant	that	Pa	hadn't	said	if there	was	a	name	he	wanted	Digger	to	have. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"George'd	be	good,"	said	the	hairy	man.	"Means	he	works	with	the	earth." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>"George?"	Ma	spoke	as	if	she	were	tasting	the	name	on	her	tongue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"George	is	right	nice,"	said	the	fat	woman	with	oak	leaves,	and	she smiled	at	the	hairy	man.	A	breeze	touched	the	taxi	and	the	crowd, erasing	the	damp	Louisiana	heat	for	a	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	smiled.	"George."	She	stated	it	in	the	quiet	voice	that	she	almost never	used,	the	voice	that	meant	she	had	decided	something	and	nothing anyone,	even	Pa,	could	do	or	say	would	ever	change	her	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"George!"	someone	in	the	crowd	shouted.	People	called,	"Good	name, ma'm!"	and	"Let's	hear	it	for	George!"	and	"Who	the	hell's	George?"	I couldn't	make	out	much	else	in	the	joyous	babble.	Someone	put	a	dark bottle	in	my	hands	and	I	drank	deeply,	thinking	this	was	soda	pop.	When I	began	to	cough,	someone	grabbed	my	shoulder.	I	thought	I	was	about	to be	spanked	for	drinking	wine,	but	the	hand	belonged	to	the	policeman, who	pushed	me	toward	the	taxi.	"Get	on	in,	boy,	your	mama	still	ought	to get	to	the	hospital." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	around.	The	hairy	man	and	the	woman	in	oak	leaves	had	gone.	I nodded,	mumbled,	"Yessir,"	and	got	in	next	to	Little	Bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	police	car	ran	its	siren	all	the	way	to	the	hospital.	Little	Bit	sat next	to	me	in	the	taxi	and	kept	sliding	onto	my	side	of	the	seat	to	look out	the	window,	but	I	didn't	mind.	Ma	sat	with	the	baby	and	smiled	and whispered	to	him,	and	the	taxi	flew	so	fast	that	the	wind	whipped</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>through	the	window,	so	fast	that	the	Louisiana	heat	couldn't	catch	us, and	Little	Bit	laughed,	and	everything	was	as	wonderful	as	it	could	be, even	if	I	did	have	a	shaved	monkey	doll	for	a	brother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	came	home	five	days	later.	Grandma	Letitia,	who'd	arrived	the	night of	Digger's	birth	to	take	care	of	Ma	and	us	kids,	went	right	back	to Minnesota.	I	tried	to	tell	Pa	about	the	tree	woman	and	the	hairy	man, but	Pa	said	that's	Mardi	Gras	for	you,	people'll	do	any	damn	thing	for fun,	and	why'd	the	hospital	expect	us	to	pay	the	full	bill	when	Ma	never even	got	a	peek	inside	the	delivery	room? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	sorry	that	Ma	didn't	remember	the	hairy	man.	I'd	wanted	to	ask	if he	had	looked	like	the	drunken	man	at	the	hospital	in	South	Carolina when	I	was	born. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	have	few	memories	about	the	pink	house	in	New	Orleans	that	Ma	loved, and	the	few	that	I	have	are	suspicious,	as	if	they	come	from	things	I was	told	rather	than	things	I	lived.	I	believe	I	remember	running	around in	a	small	yard	of	lush	green	grass	with	a	coke	bottle	in	my	hand,	but that	may	come	from	Ma	telling	me	how	all	the	neighbor	kids	drank	soda pop,	and	we	Nixes	would	want	some,	so	she	would	give	us	orange	juice	in a	Coca-Cola	bottle,	and	for	awhile,	that	satisfied	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	think	the	end	of	our	street	curved,	rather	than	came	to	an intersection.	I	remember	running	with	other	kids	around	a	winding</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>sidewalk.	Where	it	took	us,	I	have	no	idea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	do	remember	moving	from	the	pink	house.	Some	people	took	away	our swing	set--in	the	back	of	a	pick-up	truck,	I	think.	Little	Bit	and	I, and	maybe	Digger,	too,	ran	behind	it,	watching	it	go	away.	I	think	we cried.	(Ma	said	once	that	I	watched	our	possessions	being	sold,	and	she explained	that	we	would	be	getting	a	new	house,	new	furniture,	new friends,	and	new	swings.	I	considered	this	for	hours,	then	asked	"Mommy, will	we	be	getting	a	new	Daddy,	too?")</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	must	have	cried	too	as	she	said	goodbye	to	her	neighbors,	her	pink house	with	its	pink	General	Electric	appliances,	and	a	life	of	some security,	no	matter	how	small.	In	South	Carolina,	Pa	had	brought	home	a check	from	the	Army,	and	at	the	farm	in	Minnesota,	he	had	worked part-time	as	a	butcher,	and	in	New	Orleans,	he	had	been	paid	by	the owners	of	the	horses	he	had	trained,	and	later	by	the	bank	for	which	he had	sold	insurance.	But	now	he	was	going	to	work	for	his	dream,	and dreams	can't	be	counted	on	when	it's	time	to	pay	your	bills. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	sold	everything	that	would	not	fit	into	or	on	top	of	our	station wagon.	When	the	pink	house	was	bare,	we	drove	away.	Remembering	later trips,	I	can	guess	some	of	the	details	of	that	one:	Pa	sang	"Little	Joe the	Wrangler"	and	"The	Streets	of	Laredo,"	and	Ma	sang	"Baa,	Baa,	Black Sheep"	and	"Roll	Over,	Roll	Over."	I	sang	the	Daniel	Boone	theme	song, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>and	Little	Bit	sang	any	words	that	passed	through	her	mind.	We	ate	at hamburger	stands	and	truck	stops	and	Mom	and	Pop	roadside	restaurants where	Pop	tended	the	grill	and	Mom	made	a	special	of	the	day	in	the	back kitchen.	We	stayed	in	little	motels	run	by	elderly	couples	in	partial retirement.	We	drove	all	day,	departing	in	darkness	and	arriving	in darkness.	If	we	drove	past	something	that	interested	any	of	us,	we	did not	turn	back.	If	we	missed	a	road	we	had	intended	to	take,	Pa	told	Ma to	find	the	next	one	that	would	intersect	the	one	we	wanted.	In	the afternoon	we	stopped	by	city	parks	or	country	streams,	and	Pa	napped while	we	kids	ran	around,	chasing	each	other	and	yelling	and	doing	our best	to	get	a	full	day's	playing	into	half	an	hour.	Ma	sat	in	the	shade with	a	magazine,	sometimes	reading,	sometimes	fanning	herself,	always glancing	at	us	through	large	sunglasses	to	be	sure	no	one	was	eating dirt	or	chasing	large	dogs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	must	have	been	the	trip	when	Digger	got	his	name.	George	Abner	Nix had	a	metal	construction	crane	with	black	rubber	wheels	and	a	movable front	scoop.	He	played	with	it	constantly.	He	rarely	talked,	but	one	of the	words	he	knew	and	used	was	"digger,"	the	name	of	his	toy.	Pa	started calling	him	that,	and	everyone,	including	Digger,	thought	it	was	funny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	got	her	name	because	she	had	trouble	pronouncing	Letitia Bette	Nix.	She	was	a	tiny	girl	with	short	brown	hair	and	big	brown	eyes; </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>"Little	Bit"	seemed	appropriate	to	Pa	and	to	everyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	never	had	a	nickname	other	than	Chris.	I	knew	I	had	been	named	for Mark	Christopher	Nix,	my	father's	brother,	the	brother	who'd	taken	care of	him	when	he	was	little,	then	gone	off	to	the	Second	World	War,	that great	war	that	followed	the	Great	War	to	End	All	Wars,	and	died	a	hero. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn't	know	then	that	he'd	been	shot	down	over	Italy	by	American forces	after	returning	from	a	successful	mission;	I	didn't	know	then that	the	good	guys	kill	the	wrong	people,	too.	I	had	seen	a	picture	of Uncle	Mark	looking	like	John	Wayne	in	his	pilot's	uniform.	Ma	was keeping	his	little	pin-on	silver	wings	for	me	until	I	was	old	enough	to take	care	of	them.	Being	named	for	him	was	better	than	any	nickname could	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	drove	toward	Florida,	land	of	flowers,	where	Spanish	moss	and oranges	grew	on	every	tree,	Pa	told	me	Grandpa	Wade	and	Uncle	Mark stories	late	at	night,	when	I	had	the	navigator's	job	of	keeping	the driver	awake	while	watching	for	the	next	road	that	we	wanted,	and	Mom and	Digger	and	Little	Bit	slept	in	the	backseat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wade	Nix,	so	far	as	I	knew,	sprang	like	Adam	from	the	American	Midwest at	the	beginning	of	the	twentieth	century.	He	married	Bette	Kalff,	a girl	much	younger	than	him,	and	they	settled	on	a	farm	in	northern Minnesota	among	the	descendants	of	Norwegian	and	Swedish	pioneers.	In</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>photos,	they	are	a	small,	dark,	handsome	couple,	but	they	may	only	seem small	and	dark	next	to	their	tall,	fair-skinned	neighbors.	A	picture exists	in	which	a	lean,	weathered	farmer	smiles	with	a	laughing	baby	on his	knee;	Wade	Nix	died	soon	after	meeting	me,	before	I	had	a	chance	to remember	meeting	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Grandpa	Wade	story	I	heard	most	often	was	from	late	in	his	life.	He and	Bette	had	taken	a	trailer	house	down	to	Florida	for	the	winter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every	morning,	he	would	go	out	and	look	at	the	sky,	then	shake	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	several	weeks	of	this,	he	said,	"Another	goddamn	beautiful	day," </p>
<p class="calibre1">hitched	up	the	trailer,	and	started	back	to	Minnesota.	Pa	always	laughed when	he	told	that	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wade	and	Bette	Nix	had	six	children:	a	daughter,	a	son,	a	daughter,	then three	sons.	From	the	names	Bette	Nix	gave	them,	you	would	think	she	was a	devout	Christian.	The	boys	were	Matthew,	Mark,	Luke,	and	John;	the girls	were	Hope	and	Faith.	Whether	Charity	died	young,	in	the	womb,	or was	never	conceived,	I	do	not	know.	What	a	fifth	son	might	have	been named,	I	cannot	guess.	I	know	that	Grandma	Bette	believed	in	the Lutheran	church	for	human	company,	but	she	found	her	spiritual	comfort among	the	beans	and	tomatoes	of	her	gardens,	and	the	tribulations	of	the shadowy	actors	on	her	afternoon	soap	operas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	the	young	Bette	Nix	might	have	believed	or	sought,	I	cannot	say.	Pa</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>would	say	Grandma	Bette	believed	in	having	her	children	do	her	work	and sought	to	keep	them	working.	The	only	story	he	told	about	Bette	was about	how	he	would	run	down	to	the	creek	beside	their	farm	whenever	she chased	him	to	beat	him.	If	he	made	it	to	the	creek,	he	was	safe.	She	was too	fat	to	scramble	down	the	steep	bank	after	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	only	story	Grandma	Bette	told	that	I	remember	was	about	crossing	a river	in	a	covered	wagon	when	she	was	a	girl.	The	water	came	up	through the	floor	boards,	but	they	crossed	safely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	her	second	son	was	born,	Bette	said	his	name	would	be	Mark.	My Grandpa	Wade,	who	Pa	said	never	spoke	unless	he	had	something	to	say, looked	at	her	and	at	the	red-faced	baby	and	said,	"Mark	Christopher." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bette	stared	at	him,	but	he	offered	no	explanation	and	left	their	bedroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	first	names	of	her	children	seemed	to	satisfy	Bette's	wish	to	shape a	pattern	for	her	neighbors	to	admire.	The	children's	middle	names	were those	of	dead	relatives	and	presidents.	Pa's	middle	name	was	Homer,	but he	always	signed	himself	"Luke	H.	Nix."	When	he	was	in	the	Merchant Marine,	he	had	his	middle	name	legally	changed	to	"H."	so	he	could continue	to	say,	as	he	always	had,	that	the	"H."	stood	for	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	Uncle	Mark	was	born,	several	years	passed	before	the	birth	of	my father,	and	then	the	birth	of	his	younger	brother.	The	Nix	girls	had school	and	chores	around	the	farm	house	to	keep	them	busy,	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>oldest	boy,	Matt,	had	school	and	field	work	with	Grandpa	Wade,	so	Uncle Mark	served	as	Pa's	babysitter	at	least	as	often	as	either	of	his	sisters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon	after	Pa	entered	school,	Matt	Nix	left	it.	Uncle	Mark	became	the oldest	male	Nix	at	a	tiny	public	school	filled	with	Hansons,	Olsens, Petersons,	and	Lundgrens.	When	the	Nixes	got	into	fights	with	blond	town boys,	Uncle	Mark	was	the	family	champion.	Pa	began	to	start	fights	with older	boys,	knowing	that	Uncle	Mark	would	come	to	his	aid,	until	the	day Uncle	Mark	saw	what	was	happening	and	let	Pa	get	beat	thoroughly.	Pa	had a	bloody	nose	and	a	broken	tooth	from	that	one.	He	laughed	whenever	he told	about	it,	and	so	did	I. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Nix	boys	had	a	reputation	for	an	easy	way	with	girls,	according	to Pa.	When	Uncle	Mark	was	a	teenager,	he	had	the	easiest	way	of	all.	He was	tall	and	good-looking,	he	played	the	guitar,	he	drove	a	shiny Studebaker	convertible,	and	he	was	the	captain	of	the	football	team. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's	true	that	almost	every	boy	in	that	community	was	tall,	and	Mark only	knew	a	few	songs	and	probably	didn't	play	them	well,	and	the Studebaker	was	second-hand,	and	there	were	so	few	high	school	boys	in that	small	town	school	that	anyone	who	wanted	to	could	be	on	the football	team.	But	it's	also	true	that	boys	and	girls	both	liked	Uncle Mark's	smile,	and	not	everyone	was	brave	enough	or	driven	enough	to	sing in	front	of	others,	and	the	Studebaker's	paint	gleamed	and	its	engine</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>hummed,	and	even	if	anyone	could	be	on	the	team,	only	one	could	be captain,	and	that	one	was	Uncle	Mark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	it's	also	true	that	my	Pa	got	in	a	lot	of	fights	when	he	was	young, and	the	person	who'd	sit	him	down	and	hear	his	story	and	tell	him	he'd fought	well	whether	he'd	won	or	lost	was	Uncle	Mark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	story	about	Uncle	Mark	and	Grandpa	Wade	goes	like	this:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mark	and	your	Grandpa	Wade	and	I	went	into	town	one	Saturday	morning for	supplies,	and	this	fellow	I	didn't	know	came	out	of	the	store	and stopped	in	front	of	us.	We	didn't	think	anything	of	it;	we	just	began	to move	around	him,	when	he	says,	'Mark.	You,	Mark	Nix.	You	afraid	to	face	me?' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now,	this	fellow	was	big,	a	Swede	farmer	with	shoulders	that	you	get from	working	fourteen	hours	a	day	when	work	needs	to	be	done.	Being afraid	of	him	seemed	like	a	perfectly	natural	thing	to	me,	and	probably to	your	Grandpa	Wade,	too.	I	don't	know	if	Mark	was	afraid,	or	if	he just	felt	funny	having	this	happen	in	front	of	his	pa	and	his	little brother.	There	wasn't	much	Mark	could	do	but	shake	his	head	and	say, </p>
<p class="calibre1">'No,	Carl,	I'm	not	afraid	of	you.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	Swede	grins	and	says,	'All	right,	then.	You	and	me,	right	here, right	now.'	And	he	begins	to	roll	up	his	sleeves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mark	says,	'She	said	she	wasn't	your	girl	anymore.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	Swede	kind	of	loses	his	grin	and	looks	real	mean.	He	says,	'You</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>chickening	out,	Nix?' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mark	looks	at	Pa	and	looks	at	me	and	says	to	the	Swede,	'If	you	want, I'll	meet	you	tonight	at	the	Nitehawk.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	Swede	says,	'Why	should	I	wait	up	all	night	when	you're	right	here?' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now,	by	this	time,	there's	a	few	people	inside	the	store	listening,	and there's	a	couple	more	on	the	sidewalk,	and	we're	blocking	the	doorway, even	though	everyone	around	is	more	interested	in	whether	there'll	be	a fight	than	in	getting	past	us.	Mark's	kind	of	blushing,	'cause	he	knows everyone's	going	to	be	talking	about	this,	no	matter	what	he	does. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Hell,'	the	Swede	says,	real	disgusted.	'You're	yellow,	Nix.	Little yellow	prettyboy.	Come	on,	I'll	give	you	the	first	blow.	Hit	me,	if you're	man	enough."	He	sticks	out	his	chin.	"I	dare	you.	Hit	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mark	looks	at	your	grandpa,	and	your	grandpa	just	says,	'Well,	son,	hit the	man.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	would	laugh	and	repeat	that:	"'Well,	son,	hit	the	man.'"	And	then	the story	would	end	the	way	it	had	to:	"So	Mark	cold-cocks	him,	right	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	punch	to	the	chin	and	the	Swede's	on	the	ground,	wondering	what train	went	over	him.	One	punch.	Your	grandpa	says,	'Come	on,	son,'	and we	went	about	our	business.	They	were	helping	that	poor	Swede	out	of	the store	as	we	left."	Pa	would	shake	his	head	and	grin	then.	"One	punch." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Uncle	Mark	joined	the	Army	Air	Corps	when	the	U.S.	went	to	war.	Pa,	too</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>young	to	join	the	Army,	became	a	radio	operator	in	the	Merchant	Marine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	day	at	sea,	he	learned	that	Uncle	Mark	had	been	shot	down	over Italy.	A	week	later,	he	overheard	a	radio	report	that	a	ship	carrying thousands	of	American	bodies	back	from	Europe	had	been	sunk.	The	news never	reached	the	public. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	U.S.	government	buried	a	coffin	and	set	up	a	tombstone	with	my	name on	it	at	the	military	graveyard	on	the	outskirts	of	Minneapolis.	None	of the	Nix	family	traveled	to	the	funeral.	A	few	weeks	after	the	funeral, Bette	and	Wade	Nix	received	an	American	flag	in	exchange	for	their	son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	Pa	was	bitter	about	the	end	of	Uncle	Mark's	story,	I	never	heard that.	I	heard	pride	when	he	said	that	Uncle	Mark	and	his	copilot	stayed in	the	plane	until	everyone	else	had	parachuted	safely,	and	then	it	was too	late	for	them	to	bail	out,	too.	What	followed	after	that	was	just the	way	the	story	ended,	no	different	than	Custer	at	the	Little	Big	Horn or	the	charge	of	the	Light	Brigade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	told	stories	of	our	past,	too,	when	she	drove	and	Pa	rested.	Hers tended	to	be	quiet,	afternoon	tales.	Mystery	and	violence	were	usually replaced	with	humor,	but	sometimes	the	grim	things	lurked	in	the	corners of	Ma's	stories,	outside	the	telling	and	making	themselves	known	by their	shadows,	where	none	of	us	saw	them	unless	we	looked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	should	have	been	the	best	story	of	all	was,	in	Ma's	telling,	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>simple	statement	of	fact:	We	were	related	to	General	George	Armstrong Custer	through	Grandma	Letitia,	who	had	been	born	a	Kuster	with	a	K,	a cousin	or	a	second-cousin	of	his,	or	perhaps	they'd	come	from	the	same German	village	centuries	before.	The	details	didn't	matter.	One	of America's	most	famous	heroes	was	one	of	ours,	even	if	Ma	had	nothing	to say	about	his	life	or	death.	Pa	did	his	part	to	enrich	this	simple detail	for	Digger,	Little	Bit,	and	me	by	pointing	out	that	our	Indian blood	meant	we	had	ancestors	on	both	sides	of	the	Battle	of	the	Little Big	Horn,	among	its	losers	and	its	winners. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	don't	remember	any	of	Ma's	stories	about	Grandpa	Abner.	Ma	loved	him, and	so	did	we,	because	he	was	a	happy	man	who	was	always	finding	ways	to make	us	laugh.	Maybe	because	of	that,	we	didn't	need	any	stories	about him.	He	was	the	druggist	in	Rosecroix,	Minnesota,	a	small	town	about	a hundred	miles	from	the	farm	where	Pa	grew	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma's	favorite	story	about	Grandma	Letitia	was	of	a	Sunday	afternoon	when they	had	gone	driving.	Grandma	Letitia	had	seen	a	sign	advertising	a	new soft	drink,	7-Up,	and	she	had	said,	"What's	Zup?"	Grandpa	Abner	had smiled	and	said,	"I	don't	know,	dear.	What's	up?"	"No,"	said	Grandma Letitia,	pointing	adamantly	at	the	billboard.	"What's	Zup?	What's	Zup?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	was	an	only	child,	so	she	had	no	stories	to	tell	about	brave	or foolish	siblings.	She	had	been	a	happy	and	an	obedient	child,	and	as	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>daughter	of	one	of	the	three	richest	families	in	town	(the	druggist comes	after	the	two	other	wealthy	Ds	of	every	small	town,	the	doctor	and the	dentist),	Ma	had	been	protected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Ma	knew	one	story	whose	mystery	I	had	never	appreciated.	Grandma Letitia	was	one	of	four	Kuster	girls.	The	oldest,	Rose,	had	been	a journalist	for	a	good	newspaper.	Rose	Kuster	was	a	tall,	independent woman,	the	quintessence	of	the	1920s	free	women.	She	wore	short,	fringed dresses;	she	bobbed	her	hair;	she	smoked	cigarettes	and	raced	roadsters; she	kept	her	father's	Colt	.45	in	her	luggage.	She	never	married. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grandma	Letitia	thought	her	oldest	sister	was	a	scandal	and	a	delight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometime	between	the	two	world	wars,	Rose	Kuster	took	an	ocean	liner	to Europe	and	never	arrived.	No	one	knew	what	happened	to	her,	whether	she fell	overboard,	was	thrown,	or	threw	herself.	Her	trunk	came	back	to	the U.S.	without	any	hint	of	the	fate	of	its	owner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	I	never	appreciated	the	story	because	Ma	would	suggest	that	Rose had	lost	her	memory	and	married	a	count,	or	had	run	away	with	a	man	who had	not	won	Rose's	father's	approval.	Those	conclusions	could	not compare	with	struggling	to	land	a	shot-up	B-12	in	the	dark	hills	of Italy.	Only	when	I	was	older	did	I	think	of	a	moonless	night	on	the ocean,	and	a	ship	cruising	away	while	a	dance	band	played	a	fox	trot, and	a	woman	in	an	evening	gown	swimming	gamely	after	it,	knowing	her</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>cries	and	the	waving	of	her	hand	would	never	be	noticed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only	one	set	of	family	stories	remains	to	be	told	before	my	story begins.	These	are	the	stories	I	learned	as	a	child	about	Susan	Genevieve Uvdal	and	Luke	H.	Nix. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Ma	graduated	from	high	school,	she	went	hundreds	of	miles	away	to the	city,	to	Minneapolis.	At	the	University,	she	danced	late	into	the night	at	fraternity	parties	and	hotel	ballrooms,	and	eventually, homesick,	she	returned	to	her	parents'	house.	She	became	a	Wave	during the	second	World	War.	In	photos	of	her	in	uniform,	she	looks	like	Judy Garland,	another	Minnesotan.	After	the	war,	with	three	others	whom	she called	girls	but	who	must	have	been	young	women,	she	spent	a	summer driving	through	Mexico.	Handsome	men	were	always	available	to	help	them whenever	they	had	trouble	with	their	car.	When	Ma	returned	to	Minnesota, she	was	engaged	several	times,	but	she	always	found	the	men	too	stolid to	marry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	stayed	in	the	Merchant	Marine	for	some	time	after	the	war.	In Germany,	he	was	jumped	by	two	men,	perhaps	for	his	money.	Pa	knocked	one down,	straddled	his	chest,	and	tightened	his	fingers	around	the	man's throat.	The	second	man	kicked	Pa	in	the	chin,	so	Pa	banged	the	first man's	head	against	the	cobblestones.	They	repeated	this	like	figures	in a	cuckoo	clock	striking	an	hour	that	would	not	end.	At	last,	the	first</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>German	quit	kicking	Pa	and	carried	away	his	friend,	or	maybe	the Military	Police	arrived.	That	night	left	Pa	with	a	patch	of	mottled	skin on	his	jaw	where	his	beard	would	never	grow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	left	the	Merchant	Marine,	he	came	back	to	northern	Minnesota, but	not	to	the	family	farm.	He	rented	a	cabin	on	Lake	of	the	Woods,	and he	bought	a	used	red	MG	convertible,	the	only	sports	car	in	several counties.	One	summer,	he	and	his	brothers	and	sisters	put	on	the	first water-skiing	show	on	Lake	of	the	Woods.	His	cabin	became	the	county's weekend	party	house.	He	lived	the	life	Uncle	Mark	might	have	led. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	was	tending	bar	at	the	Nitehawk	on	the	evening	he	met	Ma.	She	came	in with	another	man,	and	when	Pa	asked	her	what	she'd	like,	she	said,	"In Minneapolis,	they	knew	how	to	make	highballs,	but	no	one	knows	how	to make	them	up	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Sister,	if	you	can	drink	'em,	I	can	build	'em." </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	probably	the	true	moment	of	my	conception. </p>

<h3 class="sigilnotintoc">In	the	Foundations	of	Dream</h3>

<p class="calibre1">At	the	Florida	welcome	station,	three	pretty	women	with	their	hair	piled high	on	their	heads	gave	us	smiles	and	small	paper	cups	of	orange	juice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	held	out	mine	for	more,	Ma	said,	"Chris!	What	do	you	say?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Please,"	and	the	pretty	woman	refilled	my	cup.	I	kept	saying</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>please	until	I	could	drink	no	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	gathered	brochures	of	tourist	attractions	and	showed	us	pictures	of pirates	in	Tampa,	mermaids	in	Silver	Springs,	and	cowboys	in	Ocala.	Pa said	soon	there'd	be	a	brochure	for	Dogland	here.	He	asked	one	of	the pretty	women	with	high	hair	if	they	had	any	literature	about	Latchahee County.	The	pretty	woman	frowned,	said	"Excuse	me,"	and	went	to	speak with	a	prettier	woman	with	higher	hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	whispered,	"'Piders." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"What?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"In	her	hair.	'Pider	nest." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shivered	and	stared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	youngest	of	the	three	spider	women	returned.	"I'm	sorry.	We're	all out	of	brochures	on	Latchahee	County.	There	isn't	much	there--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now,"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Beg	pardon?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	smiled.	He	always	smiled	at	pretty	women,	and	they	always	smiled	at him.	"Isn't	much	there	now.	But	there	will	be." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	yes,	sir,"	the	woman	said.	"Florida's	the	fastest	growing	state	in the	nation.	And	as	you	visit	here--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Settle	here,"	Pa	said.	"Doing	our	bit	to	keep	you	growing	so	fast." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well!"	said	the	woman.	"Welcome	to	Florida!	You,	too,	ma'm." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>Ma	said,	"Thank	you.	We're	looking	forward	to	living	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	looked	at	us.	"And	you,	li'l	chil'en?	Are	you	looking	forward to	living	here,	too?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	my	cowboy	boots	and	nodded.	Little	Bit	hid	behind	me.	Digger just	stared	at	the	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"They're	tired.	It's	been	a	long	trip." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,"	said	the	young	woman,	smiling	even	more.	"I'm	sure	it's	been."	At the	end	of	the	counter,	the	other	two	women	watched	us.	Laughing,	they waggled	their	fingers	toward	us	like	spiders	walking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Say	goodbye,	Chris,	Letitia	Bette." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	whispered,	"G'bye." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	spider	women	laughed	and	called,	"Be	seeing	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>In	Florida,	nature	has	not	been	taught	its	place.	Plants	and	animals	do not	know	the	forms	they're	permitted	up	north,	so	you	find	thick	gray swatches	of	Spanish	moss	in	the	trees,	and	snapping	turtles	with	heads shaped	like	those	of	eagles,	and	deep	carpets	of	sawgrass	growing	along the	bottoms	of	the	rivers,	and	walls	of	green	palmetto	spears	making dens	in	the	countryside	for	rattlesnakes	and	wild	pigs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	drove	to	Latchahee	County,	Ma	said,	"See,	Letitia	Bette?	The	moss is	waving	hello." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	smiled	and	waved.	"H'lo,	moss."	Digger	giggled.	I	thought	of Halloween	witches	with	thick	gray	hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pointed	with	an	empty	cowboy	cap	pistol.	"Turtle." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Seven	animals	for	Chris.	One	to	catch	up	to	Digger,	six	to catch	up	to	Letitia	Bette." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	always	hated	car	games. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"They	call	that	a	gopher	down	here.	Turtles	live	in	the	water, gophers	live	on	the	ground.	Their	heads	look	different.	Down	here,	they don't	have	hairy	gophers	like	up	north.	Down	here,	lots	of	things	are different." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	pointed.	"Fire." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	light	of	the	sunset,	a	cross	burned	before	an	old	wooden	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>Several	people	stood	around	it	wearing	sheets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Is	it	Hall'ween?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	laughed,	loud	enough	to	surprise	me.	"No,	son.	You've	got	a	couple	of months	to	go." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger,	pressing	his	hands	and	nose	against	the	window	of	the	station wagon,	stared	at	the	distant	flame.	Ma	patted	the	back	of	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"Can	we	make	a	fire?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Next	time	we	go	camping,	we'll	make	a	fire." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can	we	have	mushmellows?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"We	can	have	mushmellows." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can	I	have	my	own	bag	of	mushmellows?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	tucked	a	strand	of	hair	behind	Little	Bit's	ear.	The	burning	cross soon	disappeared	behind	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	pointed.	"Deer." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	fawn	stood	under	the	pines,	long	enough	to	be	counted,	then	slipped into	the	shadows	of	the	woods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Fourteen	for	Letitia	Bette." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"I	quit.	I	give	my	points	to	Digger,	so	he	wins." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>Ma	and	Pa	always	gave	their	points	to	Digger.	Often	we'd	catch	him looking	at	an	animal	that	none	of	us	had	seen,	and	we'd	give	him	those points,	too.	The	only	animals	he	would	call	were	dogs	and	cats,	and	then he	would	only	whisper,	"Robberlee"	or	"Nax."	Robert	E.	Lee	had	been	the neighbors'	dog	in	New	Orleans,	and	Max	had	been	their	cat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"That's	not	fair.	Chris	can't	give	his	points	to Digger,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"He	can	give	his	points	to	anyone	he	wants,	Letitia	Bette." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said.	"Life's	not	fair." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"But	we're	s'posed	to	try	to	be	fair	anyway." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"That's	about	the	size	of	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	that's	not	fair,"	Little	Bit	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	reached	over	and	ruffled	her	hair.	"Who's	my	girl?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Me!"	said	Little	Bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	that	fair?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	nodded	vigorously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	laughed.	"No,	it's	not.	I'm	just	luckier'n	I	deserve." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pointed	my	pistol	at	her	and	whispered,	"Bang." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Chris's	pointing	his	pistol	at	me!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Did	he	hurt	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>"Then	that's	okay." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stuck	my	tongue	out	at	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Chris's	sticking	his	tongue	out	at	me!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Chris,	do	you	want	a	little	bird	to	land	on	your	tongue	and	go to	the	bathroom?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pulled	my	tongue	in	fast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ha-ha!"	Little	Bit	said,	pointing	at	me.	"Ha-ha!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	drove	on	in	silence,	finally	broken	when	Pa	said,	"Down	here,	you'll hear	white	people	call	Negroes	'niggers.'	If	any	of	you	use	that	word, you'll	get	the	whipping	of	your	life.	Understand	me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said	quietly,	"Yes,	sir."	Little	Bit	bounced	on	the	seat	and	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"An'	don't	say	'ain't.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"You	know	why?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"'Cause	'ain't'	ain't	right!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	laughed,	and	Ma	smiled,	and	Digger	clapped	his	hands	together.	I pointed	a	cap	gun	into	the	night	and	whispered,	"Bang." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>Besides	watching	for	animals,	we	watched	for	interesting	billboards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">U.S.	19	had	been	decorated	with	signs	promising	wonderous	things	if	only we	would	travel	a	little	further:	Reptile	World,	Seminole	World,	The	Old Plantation,	Six-Gun	Territory,	Busch	Gardens,	Beautiful	Miami,	Scenic Tallahassee,	Historic	St.	Augustine,	all	kinds	of	motels	with	"beach"	in their	names	that	usually	added	a	line	saying	they	were	"right	on	the beach!"	Ma	thought	that	was	funny	and	said	we'd	better	not	stay	at	any beach	motels	that	weren't	on	the	beach.	Pa	pointed	at	two	signs,	for	the Fountain	of	Youth	Motor	Inn	and	Suwannee	Riverboat	Rides,	and	said	they were	just	down	the	road	from	where	we	were	going. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Almost	all	of	the	billboards	had	pictures	of	pretty	white	women	in one-piece	bathing	suits,	but	they	also	had	snake	heads	and	seashells	and panthers	and	automobiles	and	clowns	and	old	black	men	singing	and	fat black	women	laughing.	None	of	us	kids	could	read	yet,	but	I	knew	most	of the	alphabet,	and	Little	Bit	and	I	had	both	learned	to	recognize	a	few words,	especially	when	they	were	near	pictures	of	our	favorite	meal:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hamburgers!	Hamburgers!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Two	nights	in	a	row?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	and	I	said,	"Yeah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shrugged.	"It's	a	vacation." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>So	we	stopped	for	dinner	at	a	hamburger	stand	and	had	burgers,	french fries,	and	chocolate	milk	shakes	on	tables	set	between	two	rows	of parked	cars.	Behind	the	stand	were	older	cars	and	a	table	where	a	Negro family	ate.	The	air	smelled	of	burnt	meat	and	burnt	gasoline,	the	smells of	travel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	men's	room	was	locked,	and	Pa	thought	I	was	getting	too	old	to	be taken	into	the	ladies',	but	they	had	a	third	door	next	to	the	first	two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	word	on	the	door	didn't	start	with	"W"	or	"L,"	so	it	wasn't	for girls.	It	didn't	start	with	an	"M"	or	a	"G"	either;	it	started	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">"C,"	which	looked	like	a	broken	"G."	When	I	tried	the	door,	it	opened, and	there	was	a	toilet	inside,	so	I	used	it.	When	I	came	out,	a	Negro woman	at	the	door	looked	at	me	and	smiled	slightly,	and	I	felt	bad.	I hadn't	known	anyone	had	two	women's	rooms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	white	boy	coming	out	of	the	men's	room	saw	me	ducking	past	the	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	laughed	and	said,	"That's	the	lightest	nigger	I	ever	saw!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	table	I	asked	Ma,	"What's	see	oh	el	oh	ar	ee	dee?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	said,	"Oh,	that's	the	bathroom	for	the	colored	people.	Why?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head.	Ma	took	Little	Bit	and	Digger	to	the	ladies'	room.	When she	brought	them	back,	Little	Bit,	holding	Ma's	hand	and	twisting	to look	over	her	shoulder,	said,	"There's	colored	men	and	women	using	the same	baffroom!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>I	looked,	and	it	was	true.	A	whole	family,	a	man,	an	old	woman,	two boys,	and	a	girl,	had	formed	a	line	at	the	bathroom	I	had	used. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Shh." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	took	his	pipe	out	of	his	mouth,	looked	at	it,	and	said,	"They	only get	one	in	most	places	in	the	South.	Wasn't	any	different	in	New Orleans.	You	never	noticed?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	think	they	should	be	using	the	bushes?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit's	eyes	opened	wide,	and	she	shook	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"All	right,	then,"	and	put	his	pipe	back	in	his	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>After	dinner,	as	we	drove	into	the	gathering	darkness,	Ma	said,	"Should we	get	a	motel	room?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shook	his	head.	"We're	almost	there." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Everyone'll	be	asleep." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	call	the	realtor." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	don't	even	know	if	we	have	beds." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	frowned.	"There's	the	mattress	on	the	roof.	You've	got	sheets." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	call	the	realtor."	Pa	was	at	the	pay	phone	for	a	minute	or	two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	came	back,	he	said,	"Don't	look	like	that,	Susan.	You'll	be sleeping	in	your	own	house	tonight." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	nodded.	"Who	wants	to	ride	in	front?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	and	I	said,	"Me,	me!"	Pa	looked	at	Ma	and	didn't	say	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"You	rode	up	front	this	afternoon,	Little	Bit.	It's	Chris's	turn." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	grinned	in	triumph	and	jumped	in.	The	front	seat	was	best	because	you could	see	everything,	including	the	car's	control	panel.	Since	we	almost never	had	more	than	the	driver	and	a	passenger	in	the	front,	you	had	an entire	half	of	the	seat	to	yourself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma,	Little	Bit,	and	Digger	fell	asleep	quickly.	Pa	found	a	radio	station that	played	Johnny	Cash	and	other	good	country	music,	but	when	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>signal	turned	into	static,	I	couldn't	find	anything	else	on	the	dial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	woke	up	sometime	after	that,	when	Pa	said,	"That's	the	Suwannee	River up	ahead."	I	saw	the	silhouette	of	a	steel	girder	bridge	against	the dark	sky,	and	a	black	ribbon	of	river	to	either	side	of	us	as	we	rattled over	it.	I	knew	the	song,	the	first	lines,	anyway,	and	I	would	have	sung them	if	I	had	been	asked.	Pa	only	said,	"Watch	close,	son.	The	turn	off to	Dickison's	easy	to	miss." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	up	and	squinted	hard.	The	next	light	in	the	darkness	was	an electric	sign	for	The	Fountain	of	Youth	Motor	Inn,	a	small	pink	motel with	a	swimming	pool	in	its	courtyard.	At	the	far	end	of	the	pool,	water gushed	from	a	giant	bowl	molded	in	concrete. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	passed	it,	Pa	said,	"There's	a	springs	back	behind	the	hotel.	The owner	said	you	kids	can	swim	there	any	time	you	want." </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	drove	for	a	mile.	Pa	said,	"Damn,"	pulled	into	the	gravel	parking	lot of	Gideon's	19-cent	Hamburgers,	and	turned	around.	For	the	first	time	on that	trip,	we	drove	the	same	stretch	of	road	twice.	I	sat	there,	unable to	say	anything,	but	Pa	pointed	into	a	dark	field	and	said,	"Dogland." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	saw	the	shape	of	a	building	and	the	outlines	of	some	trees,	and nothing	more.	Pa	said,	"Needs	just	a	little	bit	of	work,"	and	laughed, so	I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	we	got	back	to	the	Fountain	of	Youth	Motor	Inn,	Pa	said,	"Damn	it</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>to	hell,"	and	we	turned	around	again.	I	looked	in	the	backseat.	Ma	and Digger	still	slept.	Little	Bit	lay	against	Ma's	shoulder,	but	her	eyes were	open	wide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Now,	how'n	hell'd	I	miss	that	turn?"	Little	Bit	closed	her eyes	then,	and	I	looked	up	front.	In	our	station	wagon's	headlights,	a narrow	blacktop	cut	off	from	the	highway.	Beside	it,	a	sign	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Welcome	to	Latchahee	County." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	turned	onto	the	new	road.	A	second	sign	said,	"Florida	13"	and	a third	said,	"Dickison,	12	mi."	Pa	said,	"Almost	there." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Florida	13	wound	through	forests	and	farm	land.	Just	when	I	was	about	to fall	asleep	again,	we	left	the	darkness	to	pass	a	wooden	roadhouse called	Red's	where	electric	lights	burned	and	several	speakers	under	the eaves	played	Jerry	Lee	Lewis	very	loudly	for	a	parking	lot	filled	with pickups,	semi-truck	cabs,	and	convertibles	with	their	tops	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under	the	lights,	Red's	was	a	movie	set.	A	vignette	played	just	for	me while	we	approached:	A	black-haired	boy	and	a	blond	girl	leaned	against a	crimson	Cadillac	as	they	kissed.	His	hair	was	long	and	slicked	back; hers	was	caught	in	a	ponytail.	He	wore	a	white	T-shirt;	she	wore	a	black blouse.	He	wore	tight	blue	jeans;	she	wore	tight	white	pedal	pushers.	I couldn't	see	her	face.	He	looked	up	as	our	station	wagon	passed,	and	he smiled	at	us.	Then,	as	he	put	his	lips	to	her	neck	and	she	arched	her</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>back	in	pleasure,	the	movie	set	was	gone	in	the	darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	came	to	a	motel	and	a	gas	station	where	Pa	began	to	slow	down.	A	sign said,	"Dickison,	Pop.	1137."	Pa	said,	"They'll	have	to	pop	five	more	now that	we're	here,"	but	I	didn't	get	it	and	Ma	was	still	asleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Main	Street	consisted	of	several	blocks	of	buildings,	mostly	one-story flat-roofed	single-windowed	structures	that	fronted	on	sidewalks	shaded by	water	oaks,	live	oaks,	and	Chinaberry	trees.	We	parked	in	front	of	a small	storefront	with	white	lettering	on	its	window:	"Central	Insurance Agency	and	Real	Estate,	A.	Drake,	Prop."	The	office	was	dark.	A	note	had been	tucked	in	the	screen	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	and	I	got	out.	He	looked	the	note	over	and	headed	back	for	the	car.	I ran	to	get	into	the	passenger	seat,	and	we	drove	several	blocks	to	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drake's	house.	Over	half	of	the	houses	in	Dickison	were	old,	high-roofed square	wooden	boxes	with	a	couple	of	windows	and	a	porch	in	front	and	a shed	in	back.	The	rest	were	new,	flat-roofed	rectangular	cement-block boxes	with	a	large	living	room	window,	either	no	porch	or	a	tiny	porch large	enough	for	one	person	to	huddle	out	of	the	rain,	and	a	car	port attached	to	the	living	room	side	of	the	house.	Mr.	Drake	lived	near	the Christ	the	Redeemer	Baptist	Church	in	one	of	the	new	houses.	A	yellow light	burned	next	to	his	front	door,	and	a	statue	of	a	Negro	jockey waited	to	hold	horses	next	to	the	asphalt	driveway. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>Ma	had	woken	by	then,	but	she	didn't	say	anything;	she	just	watched.	Pa parked	behind	the	Drakes'	shiny	blue	Buick,	and	he	and	I	went	up	to their	door.	Pa	pressed	the	buzzer.	An	eye	and	a	mass	of	brown	hair appeared	in	one	of	the	three	glass	panes	set	in	the	front	door,	and	then that	door	opened.	A	teen-aged	girl	in	a	poodle	skirt	stood	behind	the screen.	She	smiled	and	said,	"Hi.	You	folks	lookin'	for	my	Daddy?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"If	he's	Mr.	Drake." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just	a	minute."	The	girl	ran	back	into	the	house,	then	returned	with	a tanned	man	in	a	white	short-sleeved	shirt	and	brown	trousers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	stepped	out,	thrusting	his	hand	toward	Pa.	Lots	of	people	were taller	than	Pa,	but	Mr.	Drake	was	almost	a	full	head	taller.	"Mr.	Nix? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wasn't	sure	you	folks'd	make	it	tonight." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	men	grinned	as	they	shook	hands.	Pa	said,	"Sorry	to	bother	you	so late,	Mr.	Drake.	I	have	your	check.	We'll	take	the	key	and	get	out	of your	hair." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	had	very	little	hair	to	get	out	of;	his	brown	crewcut	looked like	a	marine's	version	of	Friar	Tuck's	tonsure.	He	shook	his	head.	"No, it	isn't	any	trouble.	I'll	get	you	folks	out	there	and	show	you	where everything	is."	He	lifted	a	hand	to	forestall	any	protest.	"Got	to	let	a man	earn	his	living.	Call	me	Artie."	He	motioned	toward	the	girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	Gwenny,	my	pride	and	joy." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>Pa	nodded.	"I'm	Luke.	This	is	my	boy,	Chris.	The	rest	of	the	family's sleeping	in	the	car." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	put	in	a	couple	of	long	days." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Yes,	sir.	All	day	long,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	laughed.	"I	bet."	He	turned	and	called,	"Gwenny,	pick	me	up	at the	old	Hawkins	Motel.	In	about	half	an	hour." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sure	thing,	Daddy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	don't	call	that	Tepes	boy	and	tell	him	you're	home	alone."	He pronounced	the	name	"teeps."	I	didn't	learn	the	spelling	until	I	saw Johnny	Tepes's	name	in	the	Dickison	Star	several	years	later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gwenny	may've	exaggerated	her	indignation	for	us.	"Daddy!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	laughed.	"'Cause	I	will	be	expecting	you	in	half	an	hour." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	may've	exaggerated	her	resignation,	too.	"Yes,	Daddy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	asked	Pa,	"Mind	if	I	drive	you	out?	It's	a	sight	easier'n following	me	or	my	directions." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	squinted.	"We	passed	the	property	on	the	way	in." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	laughed	again.	I	could	smell	a	little	beer	on	his	breath.	"Oh, I	doubt	you'd	get	lost	on	the	highway.	But	I	thought	I'd	show	you	a shortcut.	And	it's	a	mite	tricky." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Short	cut	was	always	a	phrase	of	seduction	to	Pa.	Suggesting	that	the route	was	difficult	was	the	setting	of	the	hook.	Pa	shrugged.	"Fine." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>"Good."	Mr.	Drake	reached	inside	the	door	to	pick	up	a	long	silver flashlight.	"You	want	to	carry	this,	Chris?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled.	"Yes,	sir!"	The	flashlight	was	heavy	and	twice	as	big	as	any of	Ma's	little	house	flashlights.	I	loved	anything	that	was	bigger	than it	was	supposed	to	be,	so	long	as	it	wasn't	scary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"Don't	turn	it	on	until	we	need	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	"All	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gwenny	Drake	smiled	at	me.	"Nice	meeting	you,	Chris,	Mr.	Nix."	She	gave her	father	a	kiss	on	the	cheek.	"See	you	soon,	Daddy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	don't	drive	over	fifty.	And	take	the	highway!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed.	"Yes,	Daddy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	car,	Digger	didn't	wake	up	for	introductions,	but	Little	Bit	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"What	a	little	charmer,"	and	Little	Bit	grinned.	He added,	"It's	apparent	where	she	gets	it,	Mrs.	Nix." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	smiled,	tired	and	pleased.	"I	see	I'll	have	to	warn	her	about Southern	flattery." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	some	folks	just	have	to	state	the	obvious,	and	I	fear	I'm	one,	ma'm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Get	in,	Chris."	I	hadn't	been	dawdling,	but	I	slid	into	the middle	of	the	seat	fast	and	grinned.	Mr.	Drake	got	behind	the	wheel,	Pa got	in	beside	me,	and	we	backed	out	onto	Church	Street.	As	he	drove,	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drake	said,	"Dickison's	named	for	Captain	J.	J.	Dickison	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>Confederate	Army.	In	February	of	1865,	he	turned	back	two	regiments	of Yankees	who	tried	to	march	inland	from	Cedar	Keys.	He	was	nearly	the last	Floridian	to	succeed	in	turning	back	northerners."	Mr.	Drake's smile	was	in	his	voice,	and	Pa	laughed,	so	Little	Bit	and	I	did,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	in	the	dim	glow	of	the	headlights	and	the	dashboard	and	saw Confederate	cavalry	chasing	Union	troops	while	cannons	exploded	in	the sky.	My	family	came	from	the	North,	but	I	was	Southern-born.	Besides, the	Confederates	had	better	uniforms	than	the	Yankees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	shrugged.	"The	last	time	was	a	month	later,	some	of	our	troops and	a	bunch	of	school	boys	repelled	a	Yankee	invasion	of	Tallahassee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	up	north	a	ways	at	a	place	called	Natural	Bridge.	Did	you	know Tallahassee's	the	only	Confederate	capitol	east	of	the	Mississippi	that wasn't	captured	by	the	Union?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	Ma	said.	"I	didn't." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	figure	that	either	means	the	Yankees	never	completely	whupped	us,	or we've	always	been	able	to	work	deals	with	the	North,	whether	we	liked	it or	not." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"There	been	any	hard	feelings	about	us	buying	the	Hawkins	land?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	glanced	at	him,	then	laughed	and	glanced	back	at	the	road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	no,	sir,	not	at	all.	Not	enough	Yankees	settling	in	Latchahee County	to	bother	anyone.	Down	south	and	along	the	coast,	some	folks	call</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>it	the	North's	second	invasion,	but	no	one	really	minds.	This	time	it's an	invasion	of	money,	not	soldiers,	and	no	one's	come	trying	to	tell	us how	we	ought	to	live." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Good	to	hear	that.	Susan	and	I'll	always	be	Yankees,	I suppose,	but	the	kids'll	be	talking	like	little	rebels	in	a	month,	I	bet." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	laughed.	"Kids're	like	that."	He	turned	onto	a	rutted	gravel road,	marked	only	by	a	sign	saying	County	666,	and	pointed	a	finger	out into	the	night.	"Captain	Dickison	turned	back	the	Yankees	near	Otter Creek,	but	the	townsfolk	there	were	happy	enough	with	their	name.	Around here,	we	didn't	much	like	our	old	name	of	Creek	Town,	so	we	took	on Dickison	in	1866.	Our	old	name	wasn't	on	account	of	any	creek	running through	town.	In	territorial	days,	a	Creek	Indian	village	was	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We'll	pass	by	Old	Dickison,	the	site	of	Creek	Town,	in	about	half	a mile.	Isn't	anything	there	to	see	in	the	dark."	Which	was	certainly true.	Away	from	Dickison,	there	was	only	the	night.	The	whole	of	the world	lay	inside	our	car	and	in	the	strip	of	gravel	that	rolled	through our	headlights	and	beneath	our	wheels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	Creeks	and	the	whites	lived	in	peace	in	Creek	Town,	same	as	in Chiefland	over	in	Levy	County.	And,	same	as	in	Chiefland,	they	were forced	south	as	more	and	more	whites	moved	in.	Some	of	'em	prob'ly	ended up	in	the	Everglades.	Most	of	'em	were	prob'ly	sent	to	Oklahoma	after</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a>the	Seminole	Wars.	Anyways,	the	only	Creeks	you'll	see	around	Dickison are	the	Dickison	Warriors	on	homecoming	weekend.	We	always	put	on	a	nice parade.	Gwenny'll	be	a	drum	majorette	this	year." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	pointed	toward	a	dark	strip	on	the	black	horizon.	"Old	Dickison.	Not a	heap	more	to	see	in	daylight.	Folks	keep	talking	about	turning	it	into a	county	park.	Maybe	that'll	happen	when	they	finish	this	road."	He laughed.	"That's	kind	of	a	local	joke.	Seems	like	they've	been	working on	this	road	forever." </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	passed	a	big	yellow	grading	machine	and	a	little	caterpillar	with	a shovel	on	the	front.	On	the	side	was	stenciled	"Tophet	Construction	Co." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drake	laughed	again.	"See	what	I	mean?	S'posed	to	connect	Dickison	with a	little	beach	on	the	Gulf	of	Mexico,	open	up	the	county	for	tourism.	I wouldn't	hold	my	breath." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"History	is	your	hobby,	Mr.	Drake?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	ma'm.	That	and	religion.	If	you	don't	know	those	things	about folks,	you	don't	know	dirt	about	'em.	And	it's	natural	enough	to	me, being	in	insurance	and	real	estate.	Gods	and	the	past,	yes,	indeed,	ma'm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	gestured	again	at	the	night.	"Folks	think	this	is	a	new	land,	call	it the	new	world,	but	it's	old.	People	been	coming	to	Florida	for	near	as long	as	there's	been	people.	When	the	Spaniards	came	in	the	1500s,	two tribes	held	most	of	this	part	of	the	peninsula.	The	Timucua	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>Apalachee.	The	Suwannee	River	divided	their	territory." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apalachee	sounded	like	Apache.	I	began	to	see	John	Wayne	in	the	desert, and	warriors	circling	the	wagon	train. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	was	an	Indian	village	around	the	property	you're	buying,	which probably	would've	been	Timucuan.	They	called	the	river	the	Guasaca Esqui,	the	River	of	Reeds.	De	Soto	called	it	the	River	of	the	Deer.	But its	last	Spanish	name	was	the	San	Juanee,	the	little	St.	John.	Folks	say the	coloreds	corrupted	the	name	to	Suwannee,	but	I	reckon	we	all	did, since	that's	what	we	all	call	it."	He	nudged	me.	"Might	find	arrow	heads on	your	property.	Would	you	like	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	sir!"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	find	anything	special,	you	let	me	know.	I'm	an	armchair archeologist,	too.	But	I	know	some	real	ones	at	the	University	of Florida.	You	know	what	an	archeologist	does?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"An	archeologist	is	an	active	historian.	Gets	right	in	there	with	the clues	folks	have	left	us	and	figures	out	how	they	lived." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh."	Archaeology	sounded	more	like	something	for	Digger	than	for	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	tourist	board	likes	to	say	Florida's	belonged	to	five	nations, Spain,	France,	Britain,	the	Union,	and	the	Confederacy.	That's	prob'ly</p>
<p class="calibre1">'cause	they	only	want	to	use	one	hand	to	count	with.	When	the	Spanish</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>came,	there	were	four	nations	already	here,	the	Calusa,	the	Tegesta,	the Timucua,	and	the	Apalachee.	We	don't	know	the	names	of	the	folks	who came	before	'em,	but	we	know	of	some	that	came	after.	The	Creeks	came down	with	the	British	colonists,	before	the	American	revolution,	helping</p>
<p class="calibre1">'em	fight	the	Spanish	and	enslave	the	local	Indians.	Some	of	the	Creeks stayed	here	and	got	the	name	of	Seminoles.	That	means	Runaways.	You	know about	the	Seminoles,	Chris?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Great	warriors,	and	good	people.	Before	the	U.S.	owned	this	land, slaves	would	run	south	to	be	free.	Some	of	them	set	up	their	own community,	took	over	an	old	Spanish	fort.	Others	of	'em	married	into	the Seminoles.	A	woman	named	Morning	Dew	who	had	some	Negro	blood	married a</p>
<p class="calibre1">warrior	named	Osceola,	or	As-se-he-ho-lar,	which	means	Black	Drink.	That was	a	ceremonial	brew,	sort	of	like	beer." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Morning	Dew	gave	Osceola	four	children,	and	then	some	settlers	carried her	off	as	a	slave	on	account	of	her	Negro	blood.	In	those	days,	they had	terms	for	how	much	Negro	you	had	in	you.	An	octoroon	was	an	eighth Negro,	and	I	don't	know	if	Morning	Dew	was	even	that	much	Negro.	Anyway, Osceola	never	forgave	the	Americans	for	stealing	his	wife.	A	war	lasted</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>seven	years.	Might've	ended	earlier,	but	Osceola	came	in	to	talk	under	a flag	of	truce,	and	the	American	leader--I	hope	a	Yankee--captured	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	Seminole,	Wild	Cat,	kept	the	war	going.	Cost	the	U.S.	fifteen hundred	soldiers'	lives	and	over	forty	million	dollars	in	expenses	and property	damage." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Sounds	like	Florida's	got	a	history	of	losing	battles." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	laughed.	"Don't	say	that	to	anyone	but	me.	Folks	know	I'll	say any	fool	thing	'cause	I	went	off	to	school."	He	laughed	again.	"You're right,	though.	A	history	of	losing	wars	and	losing	lands.	But	keep	in mind	that	every	one	of	those	losses	was	hard-fought." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"What	happened	to	Morning	Dew?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	gave	her	the	same	look	he'd	given	Pa.	"You	know,	I've	bored countless	people	with	that	story,	and	you're	the	first	to	ask.	I'll	find out." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Thank	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	car	slowly	approached	and	passed	us;	our	headlights	flashed	across	a pale,	elderly	couple	sitting	close	together	in	the	front	seat.	Mr.	Drake said,	"Tourists,	most	like.	Surprising	number	of	people	travel	this road,	maybe	just	to	see	where	it	goes.	Which	is	a	few	miles	past Dickison	into	absolutely	nothing	at	all."	A	new	set	of	headlights approached	from	the	north,	then	crossed	the	road	far	ahead	of	us, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>continuing	south	and	letting	us	know	we	were	almost	to	the	highway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"There,	the	short-cut	prob'ly	saved	you	a	whole	minute and	a	half."	We	came	onto	Route	19	next	to	Gideon's	Hamburgers.	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drake	jerked	his	head	toward	the	tiny	restaurant.	"Gideon	Shale's	one	of your	neighbors.	Nice	old	coot.	Makes	a	fine	hamburger.	As	long	as	you don't	mind	hearing	a	little	Jesus	every	ten	or	twenty	minutes,	you'll get	on	fine	with	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	is	he?"	Ma	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	church?"	Mr.	Drake	shook	his	head.	"Baptist,	to	be	sure.	Near everyone	down	here's	Baptist.	What	kind	of	Baptist,	I	can't	say.	He's	a happy	one	though.	He	thinks	Latchahee	County	is	the	site	of	the	Garden of	Eden." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	sounded	as	if	his	nose	had	clogged	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"Lot	of	people	in	Florida	get	their	notions.	For	the most	part,	folks	figure	you	can	believe	any	fool	thing	so	long	as	you let	them	believe	their	own	nonsense."	He	let	his	foot	off	the	gas	and flipped	the	turn	signal.	"This	is	all	sacred	ground	around	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Oh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sorry,	I'm	getting	so	wrapped	up	in	ancient	history	that	I'm	forgetting near	history."	He	eased	the	car	onto	a	gravel	driveway.	"Mrs.	DeLyon's willing	to	knock	five	thousand	dollars	off	the	buying	price." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>Pa	made	a	grunt	of	interest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	old	house	burned	down	a	couple	nights	back." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	gasped.	Pa	made	a	grunt	that	only	said	he'd	heard	what	Mr.	Drake	had said.	I	said,	"Ooh,"	and	wished	I'd	been	here	to	watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wasn't	anything	in	it.	You	must've	seen	it	was	in	sorry	shape	when	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">DeLyon	showed	it	to	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	grunted	again.	Ma	said,	"But	where'll	we	live?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"The	manager's	quarters	have	been	kept	up	nice." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Luke	said	they	were	small." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	ma'm."	Mr.	Drake	parked	our	station	wagon	beside	a	pale	green square	building	with	large	windows	on	three	sides	and	a	closed	sign	in one	of	them.	The	window	lettering	said,	"Hawkins'	Home-style	Cafe."	The headlights	shone	on	a	dirt	trail	through	an	overgrown	yard	to	a	low cinder	block	building	with	two	doors.	"If	you	don't	think	you'll	be comfortable,	we'll	head	back	into	town	and	put	you	up	at	our	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Won't	be	any	trouble." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well."	Ma	looked	at	Pa.	Pa	stared	out	at	the	charcoal	night	beyond	the car's	twin	beams	of	light.	Ma	said,	"We've	come	this	far." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"We're	here?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Of	course	we're	here.	Where	d'you	think	we	are,	there?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Chris,	everyone's	tired." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>"But	she	couldn't	even	tell--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Chris." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Yes,	sir,"	and	shut	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"I	'spect	I'll	need	that	flashlight	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	handed	it	to	him	and	felt	useless.	Pa	was	already	getting	out	of	the car,	so	I	scrambled	after	him,	and	felt	a	little	better	as	soon	as	my cowboy	boots	crunched	onto	the	gravel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"That's	two	fires	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"Nothing	suspicious	about	that.	The	row	of	motel	rooms burned	last	year	'cause	of	a	fellow	smoking	in	bed.	Did	you	know	that cigarette	companies	add	things	to	their	tobacco	so	the	cigarettes	won't go	out	fast	when	you're	not	puffing	on	'em?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	glanced	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	laughed.	"Sorry.	My	daughter	says	I	always	take	shortcuts	when I	drive	and	the	scenic	route	when	I	talk." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	turned	the	flashlight	on	and	cut	the	night	with	its	beam, revealing	the	charred	ruins	of	a	house.	"Rooster	Donati--that's	the sheriff--says	a	party	got	out	of	control.	Someone	built	a	campfire behind	the	house,	away	from	the	highway,	and	didn't	pay	any	mind	to	it till	it	was	too	late.	Prob'ly	kids	broke	into	the	house	to,	ah,	fool</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>around	and	forgot	about	their	campfire.	Or	might've	been	tramps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyways,	the	only	damage	was	property	damage." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"Anything	else	I	should	know?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	is	one	more	thing,	but	I'd	prefer	to	show	you	around	first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reassure	you	that	everything	else	is	just	the	way	you	saw	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"My	check	won't	clear	for	a	couple	of	days.	I've	got	plenty	of time	to	assure	myself." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	nodded.	"Let	me	give	your	family	the	quick	tour	and	finish	up the	ancient	history,	first.	If	you	don't	mind." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	smiled	and	handed	me	the	flashlight.	"Shine	that	over	there, Chris." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	aimed	the	light	where	he	pointed.	Alone	in	the	night,	far	from	any other	tree,	stood	a	huge	live	oak	draped	in	Spanish	moss.	Jack	the	Giant Killer	could	climb	that	tree	and	find	riches.	The	Swiss	Family	Robinson could	build	a	city	in	its	limbs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"They	call	that	the	Heart	Tree.	No	one's	sure	why. </p>
<p class="calibre1">S'posed	to've	sprouted	when	Columbus	landed.	No	one's	counted	rings,	but the	botanists	who've	looked	at	it	agree	it	could	be	that	old."	He	smiled at	me	and	Little	Bit.	"That	tree's	nearly	five	hundred	years	old." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ooh,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a>He	nodded	at	Ma.	"Remember	when	I	said	this	was	sacred	land?	Before	the Spanish	came,	the	natives	marked	the	trees	in	a	ring	five	miles	out around	this	place.	Apalachees	and	Timucuans	who'd	been	wounded	in	battle would	come	here	to	heal,	and	no	one	would	fight	on	this	ground.	Some	say it	was	the	Heart	Tree	that	was	sacred.	Some	say	it	was	Hawkins'	Spring, back	behind	the	Fountain	of	Youth	Motel.	In	either	case,	it	doesn't matter.	Sacred	ground." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	and	looked	at	my	family.	Everyone	was	listening	to	Mr.	Drake, except	for	Digger,	who	sat	on	the	dirt	and	grinned	as	he	picked	up sacred	ground	and	dropped	it	on	his	clean	dungarees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"Plenty	of	firewood	there."	Mr.	Drake	gaped,	and	Pa	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	worry.	We'll	put	a	sign	in	front	of	that	tree	for	the	tourists, Maybe	we	could	hire	you	to	write	its	history." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake's	nod	was	almost	a	bow.	"I'd	be	honored." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Where	were	the	motel	rooms?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	tapped	my	shoulder	and	pointed.	I	turned	the	beam	of	the	heavy flashlight	and	revealed	a	long	scar	in	the	earth	that	tall	grass	and small	bushes	were	beginning	to	reclaim.	Mr.	Drake	pointed	toward	the woods.	"I	think	they	dozed	the	rubble	back	into	there,	by	the	Hawkins's garbage	dump.	Nothing	salvageable	in	either	fire." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	took	from	his	pants	pocket	a	ring	of	keys	with	a	round	white	tag,	led</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a>us	to	the	restaurant	door,	opened	it,	and	snapped	on	a	light	mounted	to the	outside	of	the	building,	then	a	light	inside.	In	the	electric	glare, the	Heart	Tree	was	just	a	big	tree,	the	Hawkins	Cafe	was	an	old	roadside restaurant,	and	the	land	where	the	motel	had	burned	was	ugly	instead	of mysterious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Pa	went	to	turn	off	the	station	wagon's	lights,	Mr.	Drake	waved	at the	restaurant	and	said,	"You	can	tell	it	needs	a	good	cleaning." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma's	lips	tightened,	and	she	nodded.	The	windows	and	walls	were	thick with	grime.	Digger	stood	beside	Ma,	resting	his	head	on	her	leg.	She picked	him	up	in	both	arms	and	whispered,	"It'll	be	fine."	He	put	his head	on	her	shoulder	and	immediately	went	to	sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"Maynard	Hawkins	wasn't	much	of	a	handyman,	and	when	the title	went	to	Mrs.	DeLyon,	she	saw	no	need	to	fix	up	a	business	that'd just	compete	with	the	Fountain	of	Youth.	So	there's	plenty	to	keep	you busy	here.	But	everything's	sound.	It'll	be	worth	the	work." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Hmm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	held	the	screen	door	open	for	us.	The	restaurant	was	a	dusty version	of	the	places	we	usually	ate	in	when	we	traveled:	large	windows, a	few	bare	light	bulbs	in	the	ceiling.	The	cinder	block	walls	had	once been	white	or	light	gray.	Eight	or	ten	square,	formica-covered	tables were	stacked	in	twos	on	one	side	of	the	room;	the	upper,	upside-down</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>tables	thrust	their	iron	pedestals	into	the	air,	where	their	feet	made Xs.	Next	to	the	tables	was	a	cluster	of	steel-tube	chairs	with	pink padded	plastic-covered	backs	and	seats.	Just	inside	the	door,	a	counter ran	along	the	wall,	with	twelve	high	stools	bolted	to	the	floor	in	front of	it.	The	stools	had	dark	bases,	like	the	tables,	but	they	ended	in round	seats	with	shiny	aluminum	sides	and	padded	red	vinyl	tops.	Behind the	counter	was	a	pass-through	into	the	kitchen,	next	to	scarred swinging	doors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"A	few	hours	with	soap	and	paint,	and	it'll	be	beautiful." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	and	I	jumped	onto	two	high	stools	and	began	to	spin	ourselves around.	When	we	laughed,	Digger	woke	up,	looked	at	us	without	any expression,	and	went	back	to	sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"This'll	be	the	souvenir	shop	until	we're	ready	to	expand." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	at	him	and	Mr.	Drake	and	didn't	say	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"Everything	works.	The	grill,	the	hot	water,	the refrigerator	which	was	bought	new	three	years	ago,	the	freezer, everything.	If	you	decide	you	don't	want	to	run	a	restaurant,	you	could sell	the	furnishings	for	a	good	price." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	at	Little	Bit	and	me.	"You'll	get	dizzy."	We	were	already dizzy,	but	her	warning	was	a	fine	excuse	to	stop	spinning,	so	we	jumped down	from	the	stools.	Ma	looked	at	Mr.	Drake.	"The	manager's	quarters</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>don't	have	a	kitchen." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	ma'm,	they	don't.	But	you've	got	everything	you	could	want	for cooking	right	in	here."	He	pushed	open	the	swinging	doors	to	the restaurant's	kitchen.	I	ran	in	with	Little	Bit	right	behind	me,	and	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drake	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	kitchen	seemed	darker	than	the	front	room	because	its	walls	were hung	with	cabinets	and	its	ceiling	had	been	stained	with	smoke.	A	heavy table	dominated	the	center	of	the	room,	big	enough	to	butcher	a	pig	or	a person.	Little	Bit	and	I	peered	under	the	table,	then	raced	around	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	at	Ma,	his	face	still,	waiting	as	if	he	could	wait	forever.	Ma opened	the	oven,	turned	a	gas	burner	on	and	off,	then	smiled	the	tiniest bit	and	nodded.	Pa	turned	to	Mr.	Drake.	"Looks	fine." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good.	On	to	the	manager's	building?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"What're	you	children	looking	at?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	and	I	stood	in	front	of	a	closet	door.	I	closed	it	quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	in	the	closet.	On	an	old	calendar,	a	naked	blond	lady	was stretching	out	on	red	cloth	like	she	couldn't	get	comfortable	enough	to sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"I'm	sorry.	You	may	not	be	able	to	tell	it,	but	some tidying	up	was	done	after	Maynard	left." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p63"></a>Ma	told	us,	"I	think	you've	looked	at	that	long	enough." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	smiled.	I	felt	a	little	embarrassed	about	looking	at	a	grown-up without	any	clothes	on,	even	if	it	was	a	picture	of	a	grown-up.	As	Ma closed	the	closet	door,	Little	Bit	pointed	at	the	calendar	and	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She's	going	to	take	a	bath." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"You'll	have	to	wait	until	tomorrow	to	take	yours."	She	asked Mr.	Drake,	"Any	surprises	in	the	manager's	house?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	smiled.	"I	surely	hope	not,	ma'm."	He	made	a	gesture	like	tossing	a ball	underhand,	indicating	we	should	all	leave,	then	turned	off	the lights	and	locked	the	restaurant.	He	said	to	me,	"You	like	pirates?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	very	affirmatively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pirates	sailed	up	the	Suwannee,	way	back	when.	So	did	smugglers,	and during	the	War	Between	the	States,	so	did	blockade	runners.	There	were bootleggers	running	liquor	on	the	Suwannee	during	prohibition,	so	you might	as	well	add	gangsters	to	the	list." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Pirates,	Mr.	Drake?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	ma'm.	Blackbeard,	Black	Caesar,	Gasparilla,	Jean	LaFitte,	John Davis--	You	can	just	about	take	your	pick."	Mr.	Drake	looked	at	me.	"A pirate	couldn't	think	much	of	himself	if	he	didn't	visit	Florida	at least	once."	He	pointed	back	at	the	restaurant.	"Might	be	this	place	is named	for	a	pirate." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>Pa	said	quietly,	"Oh?"	then	added,	"Keep	that	light	on	the	path,	Chris." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	sir,"	I	said.	We	followed	the	dirt	trail	through	long	grass.	Sand spurs	stuck	to	my	pants.	When	Little	Bit,	bare-legged	in	a	dress,	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ow!"	and	brushed	at	her	calves,	Pa	picked	her	up	and	set	her	on	his shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"Captain	John	Hawkins	was	an	English	pirate	and	slave trader.	His	ship	was	the	Jesus	of	Lubeck,	the	first	English	ship	to visit	Florida	waters.	That	would've	been	in	1564." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	aimed	the	light	at	the	building	we	were	approaching.	Like	the restaurant,	it	was	flat-topped,	built	of	cinder	block,	and	painted	pale green.	Two	doors	divided	its	front	into	thirds.	Beside	each	door	was	a long	louvered	window	with	narrow	horizontal	panes	of	milky	glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hawkins	preyed	mostly	on	the	Spanish,	I	believe.	No	one	knows	if	he really	sailed	up	the	Suwannee,	but	his	log	does	mention	a	'beautefull sprynge	where	all	do	live	in	peace.'	Properly,	the	local	spring's	named for	Colonel	Josiah	Hawkins.	He	showed	up	in	the	early	eighteen	hundreds and	built	a	plantation	on	these	grounds.	He	said	he	was	one	of	Captain John's	descendants,	and	he	filed	a	claim	for	all	these	lands,	but	one	of Mrs.	DeLyon's	ancestors	went	to	court	arguing	that	the	springs	and	the land	around	it	were	theirs.	The	law	came	up	with	a	perfect compromise--it	made	everyone	unhappy.	The	DeLyons	kept	the	spring.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a>Hawkins	got	most	of	the	land.	The	Hawkins	and	the	DeLyons	were	at	odds for	nigh	on	a	hundred	years,	but	that's	all	history	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	fumbled	with	his	keys,	then	opened	the	right-hand	door	and asked	for	the	flashlight.	I	gave	it	to	him;	he	aimed	it	inside,	reached in,	and	turned	on	a	light.	"You	folks	mind	waiting	on	the	porch?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	and	Pa	both	studied	him.	Pa	said,	"Kids	can	stand	the	sight	of another	calendar." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	didn't	laugh.	Mr.	Drake	said,	"I	won't	be	a	second." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	drawled	in	the	way	that	meant	he	was	giving	you	one	chance,	and	no more.	"All	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	peeked	in	as	Mr.	Drake	entered.	The	room	looked	like	a	motel	room: blue	block	walls,	a	chipped	dresser,	a	double	bed	with	a	beige	chenille spread	that	had	a	couple	of	moth	holes,	a	night	stand	that	had	a	few cigarette	burns,	and	a	mottled	black-brown-and-white	linoleum	floor.	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drake	disappeared	through	a	door	next	to	the	closet,	then	came	outside thirty	seconds	later	through	the	further	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Well?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	laughed.	"Didn't	want	to	alarm	you,	but	Ethorne--he's	a	local Negro	who	does	odd	jobs	for	Mrs.	DeLyon--said	he'd	chased	out	a	rattler when	he	brought	the	furniture.	Mrs.	DeLyon	said	if	you	have	no	need	for these	things,	let	her	know	and	she'll	have	Ethorne	haul	'em	off	to	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>needy	family." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	at	Pa.	He	put	his	hand	on	her	arm	and	said,	"Now,	Susan.	You knew	there'd	be	rattlesnakes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	in	the	house,	I	didn't." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	there	aren't	any."	Pa	looked	at	Mr.	Drake.	"Are	there?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	told	Ma,	"No,	ma'm.	That	one	probably	slipped	in	while	Ethorne left	the	door	open	to	fetch	something.	He	said	he	looked	all	around	to make	sure	there	weren't	holes	in	the	floor	or	the	walls,	or	any	likely nests	under	the	foundation.	I	trust	Ethorne.	He's	a	better	man	than	most whites	you'll	meet." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	glanced	at	us	as	if	he	was	going	to	say	something,	but	didn't. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"Snakes	don't	like	folks	any	more	than	folks	like snakes.	You'll	see	one	now	and	then,	but	once	there's	activity	around here,	they'll	keep	their	distance." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"If	you	say	so,"	and	went	inside.	The	rest	of	us	followed	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	Ma	put	Digger	down	on	the	bed,	I	pushed	open	the	sliding	door	of the	closet	and	saw	a	room	just	long	enough	for	me	to	sleep	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"That	was	thoughtful."	Someone	had	picked	a	handful	of	small blue	flowers	and	put	them	in	water	in	a	Coca-Cola	bottle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	smiled.	"Ethorne,	I	bet." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	was	kind	of	Mrs.	DeLyon	to	see	we	had	beds	our	first	night." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a>"I	mentioned	your	husband	had	said	you'd	be	buying	furniture	when	you got	here.	She's	a	fine	lady,	is	Mrs.	DeLyon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	ran	to	catch	up	to	Pa	and	Little	Bit,	who	were	following	the	route	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drake	had	taken	on	his	search	for	snakes.	The	right-hand	bedroom's	inner door	led	to	a	small	yellow	bathroom	consisting	of	a	white	porcelain	sink and	toilet,	and	a	sheetmetal	shower.	A	door	opposite	the	first	opened	on the	left-hand	bedroom,	which	was	a	funhouse	mirror	image	of	the right-hand	one.	The	furniture	in	the	second	bedroom	had	seen	even	more use	than	the	furniture	in	the	first,	the	walls	were	green,	the	blue flowers	were	in	an	Orange	Crush	bottle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"There's	not	a	lot	of	space	for	a	family." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Got	a	big	yard." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	smiled	slightly,	then	shook	her	head.	"All	three	children	in	one	room?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	big	enough	for	'em	while	they're	small.	I	never	had	a	room	of	my own	when	I	was	a	boy.	We	can	build	on,	someday,	or	build	a	new	house once	Dogland's	a	going	concern." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	into	the	closet,	closed	the	door,	and	called,	"This	is	my	room!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"That's	the	closet,	Chris." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"Do	I	get	my	own	bed?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Not	tonight,	little	darling." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>Little	Bit	said,	"I	want	my	own	bed." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	at	Pa.	He	said,	"We	can	bring	in	the	mattress.	If	we're	staying." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Well--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	spoke	from	the	bathroom	doorway.	"I	don't	want	to	pressure you.	I'm	serious	about	being	happy	to	put	you	up	at	our	place." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	laughed.	"A	little	hard	sell,	a	little	soft?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	shrugged.	"I	won't	deny	that	I	want	you	folks	to	stay.	Time's passing	by	Latchahee	County,	and	it	doesn't	have	to	be	that	way.	The kids,	white	and	black	both,	leave	for	the	cities,	where	pay's	higher	and there's	excitement	every	night.	Seems	the	only	folks	who	stay	are	losers and	dreamers."	He	touched	his	chest	and	grinned.	"Myself,	not	excluded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	you	folks	seem	to	be	dreamers	and	doers.	I	like	that.	Latchahee County	needs	people	like	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	at	Ma.	"Write	the	check?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Well--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"You	can	write	it	now	if	you	want,	but	I	won't	deposit it	till	you	call	and	say	to.	'Cause	there's	one	thing	I	haven't	told	you yet." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I	hadn't	forgotten."	His	smile	had	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They'll	be	building	the	interstate	a	good	hour	east	of	here.	U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nineteen's	going	to	lose	some	traffic	in	the	next	few	years." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a>Ma	gasped.	I	didn't	know	what	that	meant,	but	I	knew	it	must	be	worse than	rattlesnakes	in	your	bedroom.	I	went	to	stand	beside	her.	Little Bit	took	her	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"We	knew	that	was	a	possibility	when	we	picked	this	place." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"Planning	for	the	worst	doesn't	mean	you	expect	it.	We know	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Just	means	there	won't	be	as	many	tourists	visiting accidentally.	We'll	have	to	get	them	to	visit	on	purpose." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Can	we?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"If	that's	the	choice.	I	assume	they	won't	be	shutting	down Nineteen." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	laughed.	"No." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"Then	all	we'll	really	lose	are	folks	in	a	hurry	to	get	to south	Florida.	The	ones	who're	traveling	for	scenery	will	still	come this	way.	They're	our	real	customers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"If	you	say	so." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"So.	Write	the	check?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	kids	saw	he	wanted	Ma	to	say	yes.	She	looked	at	Mr.	Drake.	"It's really	all	right	to	sleep	here	tonight	and	decide	tomorrow?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	automobile	horn	sounded	up	by	the	restaurant.	Mr.	Drake	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p70"></a>"That's	my	girl."	Then	he	said,	"That'd	be	fine	with	Mrs.	DeLyon.	The longer	you	stay,	the	more	you'll	like	it	here."	He	handed	Pa	the	ring	of keys.	"Only	thing	you	didn't	see	was	the	pump	house,	and	it	ain't	much." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"The	water's	running.	It's	probably	fine." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Give	you	a	hand	with	the	mattress?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	at	Little	Bit.	"Thanks." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	horn	sounded	again.	Pa	said,	"C'mon,	Chris." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	in	on	Digger,	who	slept,	as	always,	quite	soundly,	then	she followed	us	up	to	the	restaurant	where	Mr.	Drake's	new	Buick	blinded	us with	its	headlights.	Gwenny	identified	herself	as	the	shadow	in	the driver's	seat	by	calling,	"You	ready,	Daddy?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just	about.	Was	the	Tepes	boy	at	Red's?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	Daddy,"	she	said,	very	patiently,	and	she	brushed	her	sand-brown hair	forward	over	her	shoulder.	The	collar	of	her	yellow	shirt	with	red polka	dots	had	been	turned	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	smiled.	"That's	too	bad.	Gwenny,	this	is	Mrs.	Nix	and	Little	Bit." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey,"	said	Gwenny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hi,"	said	Ma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	just	loud	enough	that	I	could	hear,	"Her	neck." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	squinted	and	stepped	closer	to	the	car.	Gwenny	smiled	at	me	and	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hi,	handsome."	I	blushed	and	stood	still. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>Ma	said,	"Do	you	babysit?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gwenny	shrugged.	"Now	and	then." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	smiled.	"She's	the	finest	babysitter	in	Latchahee	County." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gwenny	looked	at	me,	then	tugged	a	thick	strand	of	her	hair	forward again,	hiding	a	reddened	area	at	her	throat.	"Daddy	tell	you	about	the pirates?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	still	working	on	getting	Billy	the	Kid	down	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"You	don't	remember	old	man	Goode,	Gwenny.	Died	when	you were	a	baby.	Some	said	he	was	the	Kid,	and	Pat	Garrett	lied	about killing	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gwenny	laughed.	"Oh,	Daddy."	Little	Bit	and	I	laughed,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	put	his	hand	on	my	head	and	ruffled	my	crewcut.	"I	didn't	tell a	single	stretcher	tonight,	Chris.	Might've	set	you	up	for	a	few	later, though.	'Cept	for	that	business	about	old	man	Goode,	which	was	Gwenny's fault.	He	wasn't	really	Billy	the	Kid." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	"I	knew	that,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"He	was	John	Dillinger."	He	held	his	hands	out	like	he was	holding	a	machine	gun	and	went,	"Ratta-tatta-tatta!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Daddy!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	winked	at	me.	I	blinked	both	eyes	at	him,	which	was	the	best	I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a>could	do.	Ma	smiled	at	him	and	said,	"We	shouldn't	be	keeping	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	kidding?	Gwenny	just	got	her	driver's	permit.	This	is	a	great	night for	her,	cruising	alone	and	driving	the	boys	wild."	Gwenny	wrinkled	her nose	at	him.	Mr.	Drake	stepped	over	to	the	station	wagon,	where	Pa	had finished	untying	the	mattress.	"Here,	I	got	this	end,	Luke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	grunted,	then	said,	"Bring	the	blue	suitcase,	Chris." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	sir!"	I	used	both	hands	to	drag	the	heavy	case	from	the	rear	of the	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	told	Gwenny,	"You're	pretty." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gwenny	laughed	and	said,	"Wish	the	boys	thought	so.	But	you,	you're cuter	than	a	bug." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"I	think	you're	pretty."	Then	I	looked	at	my	cowboy	boots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gwenny	nodded.	"Then	you're	my	boyfriend.	Want	some	help	with	that suitcase?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head	and	began	to	haul	it	toward	the	house,	clutching	the handle	in	both	hands	and	bumping	my	knees	with	every	step.	"Uh-uh." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"Chris	has	got	a	girlfriend,	Chris	has	got	a	girlfriend." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	not." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gwenny	said,	"You're	not	my	boyfriend?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sounded	hurt.	I	said	quietly,	"I'm	your	boyfriend,	but	I	don't	got	a girlfriend.	Okay?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a>I	hadn't	realized	Ma	had	heard.	She	laughed	and	said,	"Isn't	that	just like	a	man?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	night	ended	soon	after	that.	Pa	and	Mr.	Drake	put	the	mattress	for Little	Bit	in	one	corner	of	the	green	bedroom	and	pushed	the	double	bed against	the	wall	for	Digger	and	me.	Gwenny	helped	Ma	put	on	sheets	from a	box	out	of	the	back	of	the	station	wagon.	Pa	wrote	a	check	for	the property	after	Ma	said,	"Well,	all	right."	Ma	and	Pa	both	shook	hands with	Mr.	Drake,	everyone	smiled,	Gwenny	and	Mr.	Drake	drove	away,	and	I had	to	go	to	sleep	with	Digger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	plastic	nightlight	plugged	into	an	outlet	in	the	cinder	block	wall kept	our	bedroom	from	becoming	part	of	the	kingdom	of	night.	Its	dim	red light	held	the	room	in	the	borderland,	in	the	land	of	shadows.	The	night lay	under	our	bed	and	crouched	in	the	closet	and	peeked	through	the louvers	of	the	window	over	our	heads.	On	the	wall	above	our	bed,	a chameleon	was	perfectly	still.	Whether	it	was	watching,	sleeping,	or dead,	I	could	not	tell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	rolled	against	me.	I	pushed	him	onto	his	side	of	the	bed.	He didn't	wake.	I	hoped	he'd	pee	on	his	side	of	the	bed	if	he	had	to	pee	in bed;	he	could	sleep	in	a	damp	bed,	but	I	hated	moist	sheets	and	always had	to	get	Ma	to	change	the	linen	no	matter	which	of	us	had	wet	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	lay	curled	in	a	ball	and	thought	about	pirates	and	cowboys	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a>Confederate	troops,	and	all	the	dogs	that	would	be	coming	to	Dogland, and	Indians	in	the	woods	watching	the	settlers	who'd	come	to	build	a tourist	trap	close	to	the	banks	of	the	Suwannee.	I	thought	about	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drake,	who	seemed	like	he'd	be	a	nice	father.	I	thought	about	Gwenny Drake,	and	wondered	if	I	would	marry	her	when	I	grew	up.	I	don't	think	I thought	about	my	family;	they	were	too	much	a	part	of	me.	I	might	have wondered	whether	Pa	would	be	happy	here,	and	whether	Ma	would	like	this place	as	much	as	she	liked	the	pink	house	in	New	Orleans.	At	some	point, my	thoughts	became	dreams,	and	I	slept	through	the	warm,	Florida	night. </p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h2 id="calibre_toc_7" class="calibre4">Chapter	Three</h2>
<p class="calibre1">Things	Seen	in	Black	and	White</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	woke	at	dawn	when	Digger	climbed	over	me	to	get	out	of	bed,	and	I	woke again	an	hour	later	when	Pa	called,	"Everyone	up	who	wants	breakfast!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Across	the	room,	Little	Bit	was	dressing	in	a	T-shirt	and	jeans	that	had been	mine	a	year	before.	Ma	had	put	a	stack	of	clean	clothes	at	the	foot of	the	bed	for	me.	I	dressed	without	caring	what	I	put	on.	The	only important	items	were	my	cowboy	boots	and	my	Roy	Rogers	belt	with	two holsters	for	cap	guns,	even	though	I	only	had	one	cap	gun	left,	and	its trigger	was	broken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	used	the	toilet,	I	sat	on	the	front	edge	of	the	seat,	watching the	water	beneath	me,	and	scooted	off	as	soon	as	I	was	done.	I	had	seen</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a>a	cartoon	in	a	book	at	Grandpa	Abner's	that	showed	a	fish	leaping	out	of a	toilet	bowl	and	a	woman	staring	at	it	with	big	eyes.	I	thought	that was	funny	and	I	knew	it	was	impossible,	but	I	didn't	think	there	was	any reason	to	take	chances. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	called,	"Little	Bit	has	to	use	the	bathroom." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	yelled,	"I'm	almost	done." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	called,	"Are	you	off	the	toilet?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	yelled,	"Yes!"	Ma	opened	the	door	and	brought	Little	Bit	in.	Squeezing toothpaste	onto	my	toothbrush,	I	said,	"I	wasn't	done	yet." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Your	father's	making	breakfast	in	the	restaurant."	That	meant we	should	hurry,	so	I	slid	the	brush	over	my	teeth	while	Little	Bit	sat next	to	the	sink,	and	then	I	ran	out	of	the	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stepping	into	the	sunlight	was	stepping	into	Florida.	I	didn't	smell oranges	--	Ma	had	explained	that	oranges	grew	further	south	--	but	I smelled	a	humid	pinelands	that	was	not	like	the	New	Orleans	suburb	I	had known.	I	drew	my	pistol	and	watched	for	Injuns	and	rustlers	in	the	weeds or	behind	the	bushes.	I	knew	where	they	were:	the	clearing	for	the former	motel	and	restaurant	was	enclosed	on	three	sides	by	straight walls	of	the	old	forest.	But	no	bad	guys	showed	themselves	as	I	followed the	path	to	the	restaurant,	so	I	entered	through	the	back	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	grinned	and	said,	"Morning,	Christopher."	I	said,	"G'mornin',"	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>sat	next	to	Digger	at	the	big	table.	In	one	skillet,	Pa	tended	pancakes (bubbles	were	just	beginning	to	appear	on	their	tops	as	the	first	side fried)	and	in	another,	bacon,	which	sizzled	and	shriveled	and,	in	its way,	bubbled,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	had	a	bowl	of	Rice	Krispies	and	a	box	decorated	with	the	three elves,	Snap,	Crackle,	and	Pop.	He	was	happily	loading	his	mouth	with milk	and	sugar	drenched	cereal,	using	a	spoon	that	he	held	tightly	in his	fist.	Whitish	drool	oozed	from	the	corners	of	his	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Digger's	dribblin',"	I	announced.	Pa	had	piled	plastic	bowls	and	spoons in	the	middle	of	the	table	and	set	out	a	carton	of	milk.	I	grabbed	the biggest	bowl	and	heaped	it	full	of	Rice	Krispies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	dribblin'	on	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	sir."	Several	open	mason	jars	were	in	the	center	of	the	table	with spoons	in	them;	some	of	the	spice	containers	had	gotten	wet	when	we	had packed	in	New	Orleans,	so	Ma	or	Pa	had	transfered	the	contents.	I grabbed	a	jar	with	white	powder	and	put	three	spoonfuls	on	my	Rice	Krispies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	flipped	bacon	and	pancakes.	"Then	don't	worry	about	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	sir."	I	filled	my	bowl	with	milk	until	the	cereal	became	a	floating island,	and	listened	to	the	snap-crackle-pop,	which	was	never	as	good	as it	was	on	television.	Then	I	put	a	spoonful	in	my	mouth	and	said,"Bleh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	looked	at	me	and	grinned.	Pa	looked	at	me	and	said,	"What	is	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a>"Tastes	bad,"	I	declared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	flipped	pancakes	and	bacon	onto	two	plates	and	set	them	in	front	of us,	then	looked	at	my	cereal	bowl.	He	frowned	and	said,	"You	put	salt	on it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh."	I	reached	for	the	syrup	bottle	to	drench	my	pancakes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Finish	your	cereal." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tastes	bad,"	I	repeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Waste	not,	want	not,"	Pa	said,	which	had	no	meaning	that	I	could understand.	When	I	hesitated,	he	said,	"That	was	your	doing.	Now	you live	with	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	and	Little	Bit	came	in	then.	Ma	said,	"Smells	wonderful."	Pa	grunted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	went	straight	to	Digger	and	wiped	his	face,	but	when	I	looked	at	Pa, he	didn't	seem	to	have	noticed	that	I'd	been	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	gave	plates	of	pancakes	and	bacon	to	Ma	and	Little	Bit.	Beside	me, Digger	used	his	fork	to	break	apart	the	center	of	his	pancake,	then	lift mush	into	his	face.	I	sat	there,	looking	at	my	huge	bowl	of	salted	cereal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"What's	wrong,	Chris?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"He	dumped	salt	on	his	cereal.	Now	he	won't	eat	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Why'd	you	do	that,	Chris?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	quit	eating	to	watch.	Digger	kept	merrily	breaking	apart	his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a>pancake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"I	thought	it	was	sugar." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	nodded	and	told	Pa,	"He	thought	it	was	sugar,	Luke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I	heard."	He	sat	down	with	his	own	plate	of	pancakes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Everyone	eat,	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stared	at	the	bowl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Luke,	if	he	didn't	know--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"He's	got	to	learn	to	eat	what	he	takes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"But	if	he	didn't	know--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"He	could've	looked.	He	could've	asked.	The	salt	was	right	next to	the	pepper,	and	the	sugar	was	way	the	hell	off	to	the	side." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"It	was	a	natural	mistake." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Life	doesn't	forgive	you	for	natural	mistakes.	Everyone	eat	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	looked	at	me	with	sympathy	and	began	to	eat.	Digger	seemed	to have	finished	eating;	he	kept	making	mounds	on	his	plate	with	pancake	mush. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	at	Pa,	who	was	concentrating	on	his	breakfast,	then	said,	"Go on,	Chris.	It	may	taste	bad,	but	it	won't	hurt	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"If	you	don't	eat	it,	you	won't	get	to	eat	your	pancakes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They're	good."	She	took	a	bite	to	show	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a>Pa	said,	"You	took	it,	son.	Now	you	eat	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head	a	third	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"What	do	you	say?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	whispered,	"No,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"On	the	farm,	we	ate	when	we	had	food.	When	we	didn't	have food,	we	didn't	eat.	Have	you	ever	been	short	of	food,	Chris?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eat,	then." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	not	hungry.	Sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"If	he	misses	his	breakfast,	surely	that's	punishment	enough." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I'm	not	trying	to	punish	him.	He's	old	enough	to	be accountable	for	his	actions,	that's	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"I'll	eat	some.	I	like	Rice	Krispies." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Chris	took	'em,	now	Chris'll	eat	'em.	I	don't	want	to	talk about	this	any	more." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"They	taste	bad,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Jesus!	You	think	you're	going	to	go	through	life	eating	things	that taste	wonderful?	Eat	that	cereal." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	asking	for	a	spanking?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>Ma	said,	"Luke?	Surely	he	doesn't	deserve	a	spanking	for--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I	gave	him	an	order.	He	heard	it."	He	looked	at	me.	"I'm	going to	count	to	three,	Chris.	If	you	haven't	started	eating	by	then,	you'll get	a	spanking.	And	you'll	still	have	to	eat	the	cereal." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	my	mind,	I	said,	"That's	not	fair."	I	didn't	dare	say	it	out	loud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	understand?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"One." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	lifted	a	single	kernel	of	cereal	in	my	spoon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Real	bites,"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	scooped	a	spoonful	of	salted	cereal	and	held	it	in	front	of	my	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Two." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Go	on,"	Ma	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	grimaced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I'm	not	fooling,	Chris." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	can't!"	I	threw	the	spoon	into	my	bowl,	splashing	the	table	with	milk and	cereal,	and	jumped	from	my	chair	to	run.	Pa	caught	my	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Luke!"	Ma	cried.	"Don't!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	bent	me	over	his	thigh	and	began	spanking	me,	hard,	with	the	flat	of his	hand.	"I	told	you,	damn	it.	I	gave	you	fair	warning." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn't	make	a	sound.	Pa's	spankings	followed	set	rules.	He	spanked	you</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>until	you	cried.	Little	Bit	understood	that;	she	would	cry	after	the first	swat.	Digger	didn't	need	to	understand	that;	he	would	cry	before the	first	swat.	I	understood	that,	but	I	also	understood	that	men	didn't cry.	What	was	worse	was	that	I	knew	that	men	didn't	get	spanked.	The fact	of	being	spanked	was	worse	than	the	act. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	winced	with	each	blow	of	Pa's	hand,	and	so	did	I.	Little	Bit	and Digger	stared	in	horror,	fascination,	and,	since	the	spanking	hadn't been	provoked	by	something	I	had	done	to	them,	pity.	I	always	tried	to keep	my	face	from	showing	anything,	but	I	doubt	I	was	successful.	I usually	began	to	cry	around	the	eighth	or	ninth	blow,	maybe	to	make	Pa stop,	maybe	because	I	had	to,	and	that	satisfied	everyone.	This	time	was no	different. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	gripped	my	shoulders	to	straighten	me	up	from	his	knee.	"It's	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	can	stop	crying	and	eat." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wiped	my	nose	with	my	hand	and	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	clean	up	the	table	where	you	spilled." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	went	to	the	sink	for	a	rag.	Pa	said,	"Chris	made	the	mess."	Ma	handed me	the	rag.	I	wiped	up	the	spatter	of	milk	around	my	bowl	and	wished	I'd spilled	it	all.	Pa	said,	"If	you	don't	stop	crying,	I'll	give	you	a reason	to	keep	crying." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a>I	nodded	and	sat	with	my	face	ten	inches	from	the	bowl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well?"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	began	to	eat	like	a	robot.	Pa	was	right.	It	didn't	taste	horrible.	It didn't	taste	like	anything	at	all.	When	I	finished	the	cereal,	I	ate	my pancakes.	They	didn't	taste	like	anything,	either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	the	time	I	finished,	Digger	and	Little	Bit	had	gone	out	to	play.	Pa said,	"Learn	anything?"	I	nodded,	got	up	and	walked	toward	the	door.	Ma said	my	name	and	reached	for	my	arm,	but	I	twisted	away	from	her	and went	outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	green	cement	sidewalk	circled	the	restaurant.	I	sat	on	it,	around	the corner	from	the	back	door	where	no	one	could	see	me,	and	stared	at	the ground.	I	said,	"Ee-yuch!"	several	times,	but	I	couldn't	make	myself throw	up.	Ants	had	built	a	hill	between	the	sidewalk	and	the	gravel parking	lot.	I	considered	eating	some	to	show	everyone	how	sick	I	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	idea	made	me	ill,	so	I	didn't. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	watching	a	line	of	ants	carrying	bits	of	a	dead	caterpillar	into their	home	when	a	shadow	fell	over	me.	I	didn't	look	up,	'cause	I thought	it	was	Pa,	and	then	I	knew	it	wasn't.	The	person	smelled	wrong</p>
<p class="calibre1">--	smokey,	but	not	like	Pa's	cigars,	and	flowery,	but	not	like	Pa's shaving	lotion,	and	warm,	but	not	like	Pa's	sweat.	I	looked	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	must	have	talked	to	black	people	in	New	Orleans,	though	I	don't</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a>remember	any.	I'm	sure	I	gaped	at	the	small,	very	dark	man	standing before	me.	He	said	solemnly,	"How	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	and	Pa	had	taught	me	to	answer	the	greetings	of	adults.	I	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fine,	sir.	How're	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man's	eyebrows	drew	together,	and	then	he	smiled,	and	then	he laughed	while	shaking	his	head,	"Oh,	I's	very	fine,	yes,	sir-ree.	But why's	a	well-spoken	gentleman	like	yourself	off	a-cryin'	by	hisself?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wiped	my	nose,	which	must've	betrayed	me,	then	wiped	my	hand	on	my shorts	and	shook	my	head.	The	man	smiled	again.	"Mind	if	I	sets?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thankee,	sir."	He	sat.	We	studied	each	other.	He	had	a	narrow	moustache and	iron-gray	hair,	which	was	not	clipped	close	to	his	scalp	like	that of	most	black	men	I	had	seen.	His	hair	was	long,	glistening	with	lotion and	parted	high	on	one	side	of	his	head.	He	wore	faded	Levi	coveralls,	a blue	workshirt	that	had	been	laundered	almost	to	whiteness,	and	heavy brown	workboots,	all	of	which	seemed	a	little	large	for	him.	He	looked like	a	singer	Ma	liked,	Sammy	Davis,	Jr.,	but	he	dressed	like	a	comic strip	character	I	liked,	L'il	Abner,	except	for	the	Panama	hat	in	his hands	with	an	eagle	feather	in	its	cloth	band.	He	said,	"Go	on	and	cry if	you	want.	Don't	mind	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Wasn't	crying." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a>He	nodded.	"My	mistake.	Not	that	it	matters.	Sometimes	a	man	gets	so frustrated	he	just	gots	to	cry,	and	that's	all	there	is	to	it.	Cleans you	out,	like.	Shoot,	I	s'pose	a	man	ought	to	cry	every	now	and	then whether	he's	got	a	reason	to	or	no." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	squinted	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	calls	me	Ethorne." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mark	Christopher	Nix."	I	wiped	my	hand	on	my	shorts,	then	held	it	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	smiled,	and	we	shook.	His	skin	felt	strange.	His	palms	were	hard and	rough	like	tree	bark.	I	decided	that	all	Negroes	must	have	skin	like his.	"Pleased	to	meet	you,	Master	Nix.	I	seen	you	watchin'	the	ants." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ants	is	somethin'	else.	They	busy	all	the	time,	bustlin'	all	about.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">'xpect	they	think	they	seen	it	all	and	know	it	all.	Got	them	a	purpose, which	is	to	work.	They	know	who	their	friends	is,	which	is	ants	from their	hill.	They	know	who	their	enemies	is,	which	is	ants	from	anywheres else.	Think	it'd	be	good	to	be	a	ant?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stared	at	him	and	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	nodded.	"Can't	really	say	I	know,	neither." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind	the	restaurant,	Pa	called,	"Chris?"	Before	I	could	answer,	Pa walked	around	the	corner.	He	looked	at	us,	and	I	had	time	to	wonder	if	I was	talking	to	strangers,	which	I	wasn't	supposed	to	do.	Pa	looked	from</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a>me	to	Ethorne	and	said	in	a	firm	voice	with	a	hint	of	a	question,	"Hello." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	stood,	stiffly	and	gracefully	at	the	same	time,	and	nodded.	"How do,	sir."	He	didn't	offer	his	hand.	"I's	Ethorne	Hawkins.	I	do	a	li'l work	for	Mis'	DeLyon,	up	at	the	Fountain	o'	Youth." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	studied	him	for	an	instant,	then	held	out	his	hand.	"Luke	Nix." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	took	the	hand.	"Mist'	Nix.	This	your	boy?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	a	fine	boy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	glanced	at	me.	"Sometimes."	I	looked	away,	then	back	as	they continued	to	talk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	studied	the	yard.	His	gaze	lingered	on	the	burned	ruins	of	the old	house.	"I	'xpect	you	got	a	mess	o'	work	needs	doin'." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"I	expect	so." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	work	hard	when	I	got	a	mind	to.	You	ask	Mis'	DeLyon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	when	you	don't	have	a	mind	to?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	laughed.	"Then	I	don't	work	none	at	all,	Mist'	Nix.	That's	the best	part	o'	bein'	free." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	smiled.	"We	can	probably	keep	you	busy,	if	you've	a	mind	to	work	just now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	what	I	hoped	to	hear." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hawkins,	you	say?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a>"Yes,	sir.	My	people	was	slaves	of	Co'nel	Josiah.	When	we	was	freed,	all we	kept	was	his	name." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Malcolm	X	didn't." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	smiled	a	little	differently	than	he	had	before.	It	was	almost like	Grandpa	Abner	taking	off	his	Santa	Claus	suit	at	Christmas.	He	was still	the	same	man,	but	the	smiles	were	smaller,	and	they	meant	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Folks	'round	here's	knowed	me	as	Hawkins	nigh	on	forever.	Shoot,	I knowed	me	as	Hawkins	nigh	on	forever,	too.	An'	I	kind	o'	like	knowin' </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	only	folks	still	named	after	Co'nel	Josiah	is	li'l	black	babies." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I	can	see	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	all	stood	there,	not	really	looking	at	each	other.	Several	hundred feet	away,	cars	passed	steadily	on	the	highway,	mostly	new	cars	of tourists	and	old	cars	of	local	people.	Birds	made	bird	sounds	(I	never paid	attention	to	the	kinds	of	birds	that	lived	around	us	when	I	was	a boy)	and	in	the	woods,	something	rustled	the	bushes,	probably	squirrels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Dollar	and	a	quarter	an	hour	be	fair?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	grinned.	"Dollar	and	a	quarter	an	hour	be	very	fair." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"C'mon."	Pa	turned.	Ethorne	looked	at	me,	and	we	both	followed	Pa	around the	back	of	the	restaurant.	Ma	came	out	with	a	broom	in	her	hand,	maybe to	see	what	Digger	and	Little	Bit	were	doing.	Pa	said,	"Susan,	this	is Ethorne	Hawkins.	He'll	be	helping	us	get	the	place	fixed	up." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>Ma	brushed	a	lock	of	hair	back	from	her	forehead	with	the	back	of	her hand,	smiled	her	usual	wide,	delighted	greeting,	rubbed	her	hand	against her	skirt,	and	thrust	it	out.	"Mr.	Hawkins.	Glad	to	meet	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	looked	at	the	ground.	I	was	the	only	one	low	enough	to	see	his face;	he	looked	shy	or	embarrassed	or	pleased.	When	he	glanced	up,	he smiled	easily	and	shook	Ma's	hand.	"Mis'	Nix,	I'm	most	delighted	to	make your	acquaintance.	Please,	call	me	Ethorne." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	laughed.	"Then	you	call	me	Susan." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	shook	his	head	and	grinned.	"Oh,	no,	ma'm.	But	you	call	me Ethorne.	Mr.	Hawkins	was	one	bad,	bad	man.	All	I	got	is	his	name,	and	I wouldn't	be	so	content	with	it	if	I	had	to	hear	it	all	the	time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	frowned	and	looked	at	Pa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"His	people	were	slaves	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	took	a	quick	intake	of	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	smiled.	"Long,	long	time	ago,	ma'm.	Not	forgotten,	but	gone."	He pointed	past	the	woods,	toward	the	Fountain	of	Youth	Motor	Inn	and Hawkins	Springs.	"Wasn't	'xactly	here,	neither.	The	old	house	was	up thataways,	and	so	was	the	fields	an'	the	nigger	shacks.	Old	house	done burned.	Fields're	overgrowed	now.	Don't	hurt	me	none	to	see	it	like	this." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"The	Colonel	was	a	bad	man?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	say	that?	Oh,	I	misspoke	myself,	ma'm.	Gettin'	old.	He	was	a	hard</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a>man.	He	did	good	as	he	saw	it,	to	whoever	he	figured	needed	it.	That's</p>
<p class="calibre1">'bout	all	I	can	say." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"People	have	long	memories	around	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	laughed.	"You	been	talkin'	to	Mist'	Drake.	Him	and	me,	we	live more	in	the	past	than	the	present,	I	'xpect.	Most	folks	'round	here	are just	folks,	same	as	anywheres." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"You	must've	heard	the	joke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My	Pa	used	to	tell	it.	A	house	is	for	sale.	A	fellow	comes	to	buy	it, asks	the	oldtimer	living	next	door	how	the	local	people	are.	The oldtimer	asks	how	they	were	in	this	fellow's	last	home.	Fellow	says	they were	mean	ess	oh	bees.	The	oldtimer	nods	and	says,	a-yup,	the	locals	are pretty	much	like	that.	The	fellow	decides	not	to	buy	the	house." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	glanced	at	me,	and	I	looked	away,	as	if	I	wasn't	listening.	Pa	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Nother	fellow	comes	to	buy	it,	asks	the	oldtimer	how	the	locals	are. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	oldtimer	asks	how	they	were	in	this	second	fellow's	last	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fellow	says	they	were	the	friendliest	bunch	of	people	you	were	ever	like to	meet.	The	oldtimer	nods	and	says,	a-yup,	the	locals	are	pretty	much like	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	threw	a	rock	into	a	palmetto	clump.	It	rustled	the	leaves	as	it	fell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"No	one's	payin'	a	black	man	more'n	a	dollar	an	hour	in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a>Latchahee	County." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Can't	be	true.	I	am."	He	added,	"I	don't	expect	you	to	do	less work	than	a	white	man,	so	I	figure	I	better	not	pay	you	less	money." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank	you,	sir."	Ethorne	put	his	straw	hat	onto	his	head,	and	the	eagle feather	bobbed.	"Where	you	want	me	to	start?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Got	a	lot	of	ground	to	clear.	There	was	a	scythe	in	the	pump	house	when I	was	here	before." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	nodded.	"I's	a	fine	hand	with	a	scythe,	Mist'	Nix." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Luke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Mist'	Luke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shrugged.	"All	right.	We'll	call	you	what	you	want,	and	you	call	us what	suits	you.	I	warn	you,	I	might	not	answer	to	son-of-a-bitch." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Luke!"	and	looked	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Well,	I	wouldn't.	Chris	doesn't	know	that,	it's	time	he learned."	He	grinned	at	me,	and	I	smiled	for	the	first	time	at	him.	Pa jerked	his	head.	"C'mon."	He	headed	toward	the	pump	house,	a	wooden, flat-roofed	shack	with	peeling	lime	green	paint. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	and	Little	Bit	were	playing	in	the	gravel	parking	area,	which	was dotted	with	high,	lone	weeds	trying	to	reclaim	the	land	for	the	woods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shouted	at	Little	Bit,	"Don't	play	near	the	bushes.	Might	be	anything in	there!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>We	walked	up	to	the	pump	house,	Pa	leading,	followed	by	Ethorne,	then me.	I	kicked	the	dirt	as	I	walked.	I	wanted	to	go	away	and	play,	but	I also	wanted	to	see	the	inside	of	the	pump	house,	and	Pa	had	not dismissed	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	unlocked	the	padlock	and	opened	the	door,	a	plywood	rectangle reinforced	with	two-by-fours	and	hanging	from	two	rusty	hinges.	Some light	filtered	through	two	dusty	windows.	My	first	impression	was	of dirt,	tools,	and	machinery.	As	the	door	opened	wide,	there	was	a	sound like	hissing	or	pebbles	tumbling	against	themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	stepped	back	fast.	"Jesus	Christ!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	like	a	fire	hose	moved	in	the	gloom	beyond	the	water	pump	and tank.	Its	eyes	were	bright	beads.	Two	curved	needles	shone	within	its	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Move	easy.	Rattler	don't	want	no	more	trouble'n	we	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	breathed	quickly.	I	stared,	unable	to	move	until	Pa	said,	"Back	off, Chris.	Slow." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stepped	backwards,	watching	the	snake	undulate	on	the	pump	house's wooden	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Guess	we'll	have	to	buy	a	gun." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"You	mean	to	kill	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	we	scared	that	thing	off,	would	it	come	back?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hard	to	say.	If	it	thinks	that's	home,	most	like	it	would."	Ethorne</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a>sounded	sad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Then	we	kill	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"They's	a	scythe	in	there,	you	say?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	snorted	a	harsh	laugh.	"I	didn't	look	too	close." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	nodded	and	stepped	toward	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I	hope	you	know	what	you're	doing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Me,	too,	Mist'	Luke."	He	pushed	against	the	half-open door.	It	swung	against	the	far	wall.	The	sound	startled	us	all,	except the	snake.	Sunlight	didn't	seem	to	bother	it.	Its	skin	was	like	a chainmail	shirt	made	of	precious	metals.	Its	eyes	were	jewels.	Its flickering	tongue	was	a	taunt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	moved	slowly,	like	a	man	in	one	of	the	silent	films	that	Grandpa Abner	showed	in	his	basement	with	the	projector	turned	to	half-speed.	He approached	the	door	as	though	his	shadow,	preceding	him,	had	more substance	than	his	body.	He	seemed	to	be	trying	to	keep	his	shadow	from falling	on	the	snake,	as	if	that	much	disturbance	would	make	the	rattler attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	door,	Ethorne	peeked	in,	then	reached	his	arm	inside	to	feel along	the	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	whispered,	"You	know	how	high	a	snake	can	strike?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	shook	his	head.	"Don't	aim	to	find	out."	He	withdrew	his	hand, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a>showing	us	a	shovel.	"Scythe's	too	far	back."	He	glanced	at	us.	"Back off	some,	now,	hear?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	brushed	his	hand	in	the	air	at	his	side,	trusting	me	to	obey.	I	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	raised	the	shovel	overhead	like	a	spear,	then	thrust	it	down into	the	pump	house.	Something	thrashed	violently	as	the	shovel	struck the	floor.	Then	Ethorne	swept	the	shovel	across	the	wooden	planks, flinging	something	like	a	man's	fist	out	onto	the	grass.	The	thrashing continued	within	the	pump	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	whirled	toward	us,	calling,	"Stay	'way	from	it!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	snake's	severed	head	snapped	its	jaws	open	and	closed,	over	and	over again,	bouncing	it	around	in	the	long	grass.	Ethorne	said,	"Snake	needs time	to	study	out	it's	dead." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	and	Digger	had	seen	that	something	interesting	was	happening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	spotted	them	as	they	approached	us.	He	yelled,	"You	kids,	stay	back!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	grabbed	Digger's	hand.	They	stood,	staring	as	the	snake's head	continued	to	seek	escape	or	a	victim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	turned	with	the	shovel	and	plunged	it	back	into	the	pump	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	and	I	turned	to	watch	him	sweep	out	the	snake's	writhing	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	screamed.	I	looked	at	her.	Little	Bit	was	still	twenty	feet away	from	the	snake's	head,	but	Digger,	laughing,	ran	toward	it	on pudgy,	unsteady	legs. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a>Pa	shouted,	"Digger!	No!"	Digger,	usually	the	most	obedient	of	us	all, did	not	seem	to	hear.	He	stretched	a	small	hand	out	for	the	shiny	thing that	danced	in	our	yard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	and	Ethorne	both	ran	forward.	Pa	held	his	arms	out	to	grab	Digger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	lifted	the	shovel	as	if	he	hoped	to	bat	the	snake	head	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	stopped	still	in	mid-squat,	his	hand	six	inches	from	the	snake's head,	and	looked	at	the	two	men	running	toward	him.	His	smile	faded.	He squinted	as	if	he	was	trying	to	decide	whether	he	had	done	something	for which	he	should	cry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	snake's	jaws	thrashed	once	more.	The	head	sprang	into	the	air,	its jaws	open	to	their	widest.	They	closed	around	Digger's	hand,	enclosing it	within	its	bite.	Its	fangs	buried	themselves	into	Digger's	wrist.	Its eyes	glistened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	stared	at	his	arm,	terminating	in	the	head	of	a	snake	that	smiled as	it	watched	the	boy	puzzle	out	what	had	happened.	Then	Digger screamed,	waved	his	arms,	and	tried	to	run	back	toward	the	restaurant where	Ma	was	working. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	caught	up	to	him	as	he	tripped	and	fell.	Pa	seized	the	snake's	jaws in	both	hands	and	ripped	the	head	apart.	Blood	dripped	from	Digger's wrist	and	Pa's	fingers.	Digger	continued	to	scream	as	if	he	would squeeze	every	bit	of	breath	from	his	lungs	before	he	could	inhale	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a>begin	again.	Pa	snatched	him	up,	patted	his	back,	saying,	"Easy,	son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Easy,"	and	began	carrying	Digger	toward	our	station	wagon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	ran	from	the	restaurant	with	a	broom	in	her	hands.	She	cried,	"Luke! </p>
<p class="calibre1">What's--"	Then	she	saw	Digger	and	dropped	the	broom.	"George!	Oh,	my God,	Georgie!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	screamed	louder	when	he	saw	Ma	and	reached	for	her	with blood-smeared	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Susan,	don't	get	excited.	We've	got	to	stay	calm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Let	me	help,	ma'm.	I	know	what	to	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	struggled	in	Pa's	arms,	reaching	for	Ma.	She	grabbed	him	from	Pa, saying,	"Oh,	Georgie,	Georgie,"	and	then,	to	Pa,	"What	happened?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Snake	bite." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	gasped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	pulled	out	a	red	bandanna,	twirled	it	between	his	fingers	into	a rope,	and	telling	Digger,	"This	be	all	right,	now,"	tied	the	bandanna around	Digger's	arm,	above	the	bite,	then	tested	it	with	his	finger	to see	that	it	was	snug	enough	to	slow	the	flow	of	blood,	yet	not	so	tight as	to	stop	it.	A	little	blood	continued	to	ooze	from	the	two	holes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	tried	to	wrap	his	arms	around	Ma's	neck.	Ethorne	caught	Digger's wrists	and	brought	them	down	gently,	telling	Ma,	"Keep	his	bitten	arm low,	closer	to	the	earth	than	his	heart.	Poison	slows	some	when	it	has</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a>to	work	uphill." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	closed	her	arm	around	Digger's	shoulders	to	trap	his	arms	at	his side.	"We've	got	to	call--	Who	has	the	nearest	phone?	Oh,	my	God." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	asked	Ethorne,	"Is	Dickison	the	nearest	hospital?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ain't	no	time,	Mist'	Luke."	Ethorne's	hand	came	out	of	his	jeans	pocket with	a	pearl-handled	folding	razor	and	a	box	of	Red	Devil	matches.	"Got to	get	some	o'	the	poison	out	of	'im	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"But--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	knows	what	I'm	doin',	ma'm.	I'd	do	this	for	my	own	chil'en." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	continued	to	scream.	Ma	pressed	her	cheek	against	his,	while	Pa stood	beside	the	station	wagon,	ready	to	open	the	back	door.	Pa	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	at	him,	then	nodded	too.	She	continued	to	say,	"Easy,	Georgie, easy."	She	didn't	seem	to	see	that	Digger	knew	something	bad	was happening	because	she	used	his	real	name.	When	Little	Bit	touched	his leg	and	said,	"It's	okay,	Digger,"	he	quit	screaming	and	only	cried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	lit	a	match	in	one	hand,	snapping	the	head	with	his	thumbnail, and	flicked	open	the	straight	razor	in	his	other	hand.	Passing	the	flame under	the	blade,	he	said,	"Now,	don't	be	scared,	Mist'	Digger.	I	got	to cut	you,	but	I	won't	go	so	deep	as	ol'	Mist'	Snake." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	continued	to	cry,	wrapping	his	arms	around	Ma's	side.	Her	dress</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>and	her	face	were	flecked	with	his	blood.	Ethorne	glanced	at	Pa.	"We	got to." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	had	been	pressing	his	own	cut	fingers	against	a	handkerchief.	He pocketed	it,	took	Digger's	bit	hand,	and	held	the	arm	straight	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Easy,	son,"	he	said,	surprisingly	helpless.	"Easy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	rested	his	hand	on	Pa's,	pressing	downward.	Pa	lowered	Digger's	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Goin'	be	fine,	Mist'	Digger."	He	cut	four	shallow	slits, each	less	than	half	an	inch	long,	down	the	length	of	Digger's	arm.	As	he made	the	incisions,	he	said	for	the	rest	of	us,	or	maybe	for	himself, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Two	cuts	at	the	bite	marks.	Two	a	little	lower,	where	Mist'	Snake spurted	his	poison.	No	need	to	cut	deep.	Just	the	surface,	so	the blood'll	let	the	poison	out.	We	be	mos'	careful	o'	the	muscles	and	the nerves,	um-hmm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	screamed	louder	as	dark	blood	sprang	from	the	cuts.	Ma	pressed her	head	hard	against	the	side	of	his,	saying,	"'S	all	right,	baby.	'S</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	right."	Pa	continued	to	hold	Digger's	wrist	in	one	hand.	He	rested his	other	lightly	on	Digger's	upper	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	picked	something	out	of	one	of	the	wounds	and	tossed	it	aside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	leaned	over,	fastening	his	lips	around	Digger's	cuts,	then	spat	blood out	with	a	grimace.	He	did	this	several	times.	then	paused	to	say,	"We need	to	get	over	to	the	Fountain	o'	Youth	now.	Mis'	DeLyon's	good	with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>these	troubles,	an'	she	has	a	telephone	to	call	the	doctor." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"All	right.	Susan--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	going."	Ma	used	the	hard	voice	we	rarely	heard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"We're	all	going.	You	kids,	hop	in	front,	fast." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne,	Mom,	and	Digger	slid	into	the	back.	I	had	been	squatting nearby,	running	my	fingers	through	the	gravel;	I	scrambled	into	the front	seat	with	Little	Bit,	where	I	dropped	the	fang	that	Ethorne	had thrown	aside	into	my	shirt	pocket.	As	doors	slammed,	Pa	drove	away	more quickly	than	I	had	ever	known:	Gravel	slid	beneath	our	wheels	as	he backed	up,	and	when	he	turned	onto	the	highway,	the	rear	end	of	the station	wagon	slewed	sideways	to	line	up	with	the	front	wheels,	and	we hurtled	up	Route	19. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	kept	applying	suction	to	Digger's	arm	and	spitting	the	result out	the	car	window,	spattering	the	rear	glass.	Digger	had	stopped crying,	which	was	scarier	than	his	crying	and	screaming	had	been.	He	lay against	Ma	like	he	was	going	to	nap.	Tears	ran	from	Ma's	eyes,	but	her voice	was	calm	as	she	said,	"It's	all	right,	Digger.	Everything's	fine, now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	Fountain	of	Youth	Motor	Inn,	Pa	screeched	the	brakes	as	we	halted under	the	car	port	by	the	office.	Ethorne	was	the	first	one	out.	He yelled,	"Mis'	DeLyon!	A	child	needs	you!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a>A	dark	woman	stepped	from	one	of	the	guest	rooms,	pulling	the	door firmly	shut	behind	her.	In	a	place	where	most	people's	race	was	obvious, hers	was	impossible	to	guess.	Her	skin	was	a	brown	that	might	have	been its	natural	hue	or	might	have	come	from	years	in	the	sun.	Her	hair, drawn	back	in	a	tail,	was	thick	and	black.	Her	eyes	were	as	dark	as	her hair;	the	skin	around	them	was	lined	from	weather	and	laughter.	She	was small	without	being	slender;	she	looked	as	if	she	could	carry	her	own weight	on	her	shoulders	and	walk	all	day	without	rest.	She	wore	no make-up	or	jewelry.	Her	clothes	consisted	of	a	short-sleeved	white shirt,	blue	jeans,	and	white	tennis	shoes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	may	have	been	the	first	time	I	knew	my	mother	was	pretty.	I'd always	known	that	Ma	was	beautiful,	but	this	was	the	first	time	that	I saw	another	woman	and	compared	Ma	to	her.	Ma	was	a	little	taller	and bustier	than	Mis'	DeLyon.	Ma's	eyes	were	green,	and	her	hair	was	short and	curly	and	reddish-brown.	She	wore	red	lipstick	and	a	necklace	of white	beads	with	her	light	blue	dress	and	white	sandals.	Her	face,	as	I looked,	was	etched	with	anguish	for	Digger.	Mis'	DeLyon's	face	was	calm, concerned	but	confident,	and	I	realized	that	Ma's	face	always	showed	her feelings,	joy	or	fear,	but	rarely	confidence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mis'	DeLyon	saw	Digger's	wounded	wrist,	then	looked	from	it	to	Pa's fingers.	Ethorne	explained,	"Snake	bite,	Mis'	DeLyon.	Mist'	Luke	tore</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a>its	mouth	off	o'	Mast'	Digger	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mis'	DeLyon	looked	at	Pa.	"There's	a	phone	in	the	office	with	a	list	of numbers	beside	it.	Call	Dr.	Lamont	and	tell	him	you'll	be	bringing	your boy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded	as	he	headed	into	the	office.	Ma	started	to	follow,	but	Mis' </p>
<p class="calibre1">DeLyon	touched	her	shoulder.	Ma	turned	back,	frowning.	Mis'	DeLyon	took Digger's	wrist	in	her	hand.	He	opened	his	eyes	when	she	did	that,	then closed	them	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"I	been	suckin'	the	poison	out	o'	him.	But	he's	mighty	small." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mis'	DeLyon	said,	"Come."	She	strode	across	the	black-top	to	the swimming	pool.	We	followed	as	obediently	as	we	would	follow	the	Pied Piper	of	Hamlin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	pool	was	a	typical	small	southern	motel's	outdoor	pool,	a	rectangle with	a	diving	board	at	the	deep	end	and	a	shallow	end	for	non-swimmers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	next	to	the	shallow	end	was	the	motel's	trademark,	the	green	cement fountain	shaped	like	a	sports	trophy.	Water	bubbled	from	its	top, spilling	into	a	metal-lined	basin,	then	into	the	pool.	Next	to	the fountain	was	a	plastic	dispenser	for	paper	Dixie	cups. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mis'	DeLyon	yanked	free	a	cup	and	dipped	it	into	the	basin.	"This,"	she told	Ma,	"is	piped	from	the	springs	behind	the	motel.	There's	no	water purer,	I	assure	you."	She	poured	it	on	Digger's	wrist	and	washed	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a>slits	with	her	fingers,	then	sprinkled	some	drops	onto	his	forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	opened	his	eyes,	she	smiled.	"Hello,	Master	Digger.	Drink	this." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger's	head	rolled	from	side	to	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mis'	DeLyon	said,	"For	your	mother's	sake."	She	put	the	cup	to	his	lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uh,"	Digger	said,	perhaps	in	protest.	As	his	lips	parted,	Mis'	DeLyon poured	water	into	his	mouth.	He	sputtered,	and	water	dripped	over	his chin,	onto	his	shirt	and	onto	Ma's	dress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Drink,"	Mis'	DeLyon	repeated,	tipping	more	water	into	his	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	eyes	opened	wider	and	he	began	to	drink	deeply.	Ma	laughed,	and	Mis' </p>
<p class="calibre1">DeLyon	smiled	again.	Digger	bobbed	his	head	once	and	announced,	"Good." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Mis'	DeLyon	filled	a	second	cup	for	him,	Ma	laughed	louder,	and hugged	him	harder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mis'	DeLyon	looked	at	Ethorne.	"I	suppose	you	haven't	rinsed	out	your mouth." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ain't	been	time,	Mis'	DeLyon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shaking	her	head	without	losing	her	smile,	she	set	her	hand	on	his	upper arm.	"Oh,	Ethorne."	She	took	a	clean	handkerchief	from	her	jeans'	pocket and	tied	it	over	Digger's	cuts	while	Ethorne	snagged	a	paper	cup,	filled it,	rinsed	his	mouth,	spat,	then	filled	his	mouth	and	drank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	came	out	of	the	motel	office.	"They're	expecting	us." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mis'	DeLyon	said,	"Let	me	see	your	hands." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a>Pa	stood	at	the	driver's	door.	"They're	expecting	us." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mis'	DeLyon	said,	"If	this	makes	a	difference,	it	will	be	for	the	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Come." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa's	eyes	narrowed,	then	he	strode	toward	Ma	and	Mis'	DeLyon.	I	may	have seen	him,	too,	for	the	first	time	that	day	as	someone	other	than	my father.	I	had	always	seen	a	wild	force	in	Pa:	He	never	needed	to	rest when	something	needed	doing.	That	force	drove	him	toward	us	now.	But there	was	something	else	I	had	never	seen,	a	helplessness	before	the threat	to	Digger	that	scared	me.	I	knew	how	easily	Pa's	helplessness could	turn	to	anger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	also	saw	that	Pa,	unlike	Ma	or	us	kids,	looked	like	Mis'	DeLyon.	His hair	and	his	eyes	were	black.	His	skin	tanned	quickly	and	darkly	and almost	never	burned	beneath	the	sun.	Though	his	face	showed	emotions	as easily	as	Ma's,	a	fierce	confidence	always	lurked	beneath	his	expressions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stopped	in	front	of	Mis'	DeLyon.	"Well?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	reached	for	his	hands	and	turned	the	palms	upward.	"From	its	teeth?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	nodded.	"I	feel	fine." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"One	o'	the	fangs	tore	off	in	Digger." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"The	other	didn't	get	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mis'	DeLyon	poured	water	from	the	fountain	onto	Pa's	hands.	"You	can't rely	on	strength	alone." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a>He	gave	the	humorless	laugh.	"You	rely	on	what	you've	got." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	patted	the	cuts	clean.	"Exactly."	Before	he	could	respond,	she	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	were	luckier	than	your	son.	Have	Doctor	Lamont	look	at	these,	just to	be	sure." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hell,	I	don't	need--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	if	you	feel	weak	on	the	way,	have	someone	else	drive.	Understand?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	at	her,	and,	to	my	amazement,	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mis'	DeLyon	said,	"Ethorne,	will	you	guide	them?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sure	thing,	ma'm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Mis'	DeLyon--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mis'	DeLyon	shook	her	head.	"Neighbors	must	help	each	other." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	smiled.	"Thank	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Go.	Dr.	Lamont	will	worry."	Mis'	DeLyon	refilled	Digger's	cup	and handed	it	to	Ma.	"Keep	him	warm,	and	give	him	all	the	water	he	wants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He'll	be	fine." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"C'mon."	We	all	got	into	the	station	wagon	in	the	same	places where	we	had	sat	before.	Pa	nodded	to	Mis'	DeLyon,	and	we	drove	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mis'	DeLyon	stood	at	the	edge	of	the	highway	and	watched	us	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	waved	back	at	her	and	whispered,	"She's	a	nice	lady." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	turned	toward	Dickison,	Pa	told	Ethorne,	"Had	trouble	finding	this road	last	night	in	the	dark." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a>Ethorne	smiled.	"Oh,	it	be	easy,	now	you	belong	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a>At	Dr.	Lamont's	house,	Ma	and	Digger	went	into	the	office	with	him	and his	nurse.	Pa,	Little	Bit,	and	I	went	back	outside,	where	Ethorne	waited by	the	car.	He	smiled	at	us,	then	walked	around	the	doctor's	yard	with Little	Bit,	telling	her	the	names	of	the	plants.	Pa	and	I	sat	in	the	sun on	the	hood	of	the	station	wagon.	The	metal	was	warm	and	hard	under	my butt,	but	I	liked	sitting	there	with	my	cowboy	boots	resting	on	the bumper.	I	watched	Little	Bit	and	Ethorne,	and	wondered	about	whether Digger	would	get	better,	or	if	he	would	die,	and	if	he	died,	would	he get	a	Viking	burial	on	a	burning	boat	pushed	out	to	sea.	Pa	was	quiet beside	me,	and	he	didn't	seem	angry,	so	I	didn't	think	about	him	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	warning,	Pa	said,	quietly	enough	that	only	I	could	hear,	"When	I was	a	boy	and	I'd	done	something	wrong,	my	Pa	beat	me	with	a	razor strap.	You	know	what	that	is?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	a	strap	of	leather	that	you	use	to	sharpen	a	razor.	You	strop	the razor	back	and	forth	on	it."	Pa	closed	his	hand	as	though	he	were holding	a	straight	razor	and	turned	his	wrist	from	side	to	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Worst	part	was	he'd	send	me	to	bring	the	strap	from	where	it	hung	on	a nail	in	the	barn.	I	hated	fetching	it	more	than	I	hated	the	beating.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a>never	knew	whether	it	was	better	to	walk	slow,	to	put	it	off	as	long	as possible,	or	to	run,	to	get	the	whole	thing	over	fast." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	again,	but	Pa	didn't	see	that.	He	had	been	looking	at	his scuffed	engineer	boots.	Now	he	looked	up,	not	at	me	but	at	the	doctor's big	white	wooden	house.	"And	when	my	Pa	was	a	boy,	his	Pa	would	take	a whip	to	him	when	he	acted	up.	You	imagine	what	that's	like?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	grimaced.	"Bad?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	gave	a	harsh	bark	of	a	laugh.	"Oh,	yeah.	Bad's	a	start	on	what	that's like."	He	shook	his	head,	then	looked	at	me.	"Spanking	only	hurts	a little	while,	doesn't	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Yes,	Pa." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	nodded.	"So	maybe	things're	getting	better	for	the	Nixes.	That's	what I	tell	myself.	That's	all	you	can	hope	for,	isn't	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	question	wasn't	directed	to	me.	He	spoke	it	to	his	open	hands.	I	was glad,	since	I	didn't	have	an	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Lamont,	a	thin,	brown-haired	man	a	little	older	than	Pa,	came	onto his	porch.	"Your	boy'll	be	fine.	We're	done	for	now,	if	you	want	to	come in." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	at	Ethorne.	"You	want	to	come	in?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	laughed	easily.	"Oh,	I	like	it	outdoors	on	a	pretty	day	like	this." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"I	like	it	outdoors,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a>Dr.	Lamont	looked	at	Pa,	then	shrugged.	"Your	boy's	resting	easy.	No reason	he	can't	go	home	with	you.	Doesn't	look	like	any	poison	got	into him,	but	you'll	want	to	watch	him	careful.	Skin	tends	to	get	ugly	'round a	rattler	bite.	It'll	usually	slough	off,	leaving	an	ulcer	there,	danger of	gangrene,	all	kinds	of	potential	problems.	Could	be	expensive,	too, if	it	called	for	reconstructive	surgery.	But	it	looks	like	your	boy	was sure	lucky.	Considering,	of	course." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Lamont	tapped	out	a	Camel	cigarette,	held	the	pack	out	to	Pa,	then lit	one	for	himself	when	Pa	shook	his	head.	"Some	docs'd	cut	out	the	bit area,	just	to	be	safe.	But	his	color's	good,	the	skin	around	the	bite seems	healthy,	his	breathing's	easy.	I'm	of	a	mind	to	leave	it	be,	for now,	least	ways.	Your	rattler	must've	sprayed	near	all	its	poison	'fore it	latched	onto	the	boy's	wrist.	Then	since	you	treated	him	fast,	you got	out	most	of	what	poison	was	left	on	the	fangs." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Lamont	dragged	deep	on	his	cigarette.	"Or	it	might	just	be	a miracle.	I'll	take	payment,	but	I	can't	take	credit." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	smiled	and	nodded.	"Thanks,	Doctor." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Lamont	said,	"Your	wife	said	you'd	been	cut	by	its	teeth." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Lamont	said,	"I	don't	charge	to	look,	not	when	you're	already	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Well."	He	held	out	his	palms.	"Mis'	DeLyon	cleaned	'em	up." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>The	cuts	had	closed,	leaving	a	thin	scab	line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Lamont	looked	closely.	"Your	snake	must've	been	shooting	blanks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keep	your	hands	clean	and	bandaged	till	that's	healed.	If	there's	any inflammation,	or	if	you	just	get	to	feeling	poorly,	tell	me	immediately, hear?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	Ma	and	Digger	showed	up	on	the	porch	then.	Ma's	dress	was damp	from	where	she'd	tried	to	sponge	away	Digger's	blood,	but	the	cloth was	drying	quickly.	Ma	carried	Digger,	and	he	seemed	to	be	asleep,	but when	the	sunlight	fell	on	his	face,	he	looked	at	us	and,	smiling,	waved his	bandaged	wrist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey,	Digger,"	Little	Bit	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	grinned.	"You're	a	tough	kid,	Digger." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"He	was	very	brave." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	smiled,	then	slumped	back	against	Ma's	shoulder.	I	wished	the snake	had	bitten	me	instead	of	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Lamont	said,	"Give	him	plenty	of	liquids	and	plenty	of	rest.	Kids bounce	back	in	no	time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"We	haven't	opened	a	local	checking	account	yet--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Lamont	said,	"I	understand.	We'll	send	the	bill."	He	and	Pa	shook hands,	and	we	all	got	into	the	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Driving	toward	downtown,	Ethorne	said,	"Dr.	Lamont,	he	takes	good	care</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a>o'	the	white	folks.	Coloreds	has	their	own	doctor	up	in	Waycross." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	at	Pa.	He	grunted	to	say	he'd	heard	Ethorne,	and	Ma	relaxed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Since	we're	in	town,	we	might	as	well	get	some	business	done." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	glanced	at	Ma.	"You	haven't	changed	your	mind	about	staying?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	stroked	Digger's	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"We'll	get	the	land	cleared	back,	fast.	Activity'll	keep	the wildlife	away.	You'll	see." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Can't	keep	kids	perfectly	safe	anywhere,	Susan.	All	you	can	do is	watch	'em,	and	do	what	you	can	when	things	go	wrong.	Seems	to	me today	proved	there's	good	people	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"I	know	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Then	I'll	tell	Drake	what	we	decided." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Yes."	It	was	resignation,	not	agreement.	We	all	knew	that.	No one	said	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dickison	in	daylight	looked	like	any	of	the	small	Southern	towns	we'd driven	through	on	our	way	to	Dogland.	I	spotted	a	Five	and	Dime,	which	I pointed	out	to	Ma,	in	case	she	needed	to	buy	someone	a	new	cap	gun	or	a bag	of	plastic	army	men.	She	smiled	and	said	something	about	needing	to buy	some	thread,	which	made	Pa	say,	"If	there's	time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	stopped	at	the	Dickison	State	Bank.	A	happy	man	gave	us	kids</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a>lollipops	while	Ma	and	Pa	got	account	books,	including	savings	accounts for	each	of	us	with	the	five-dollar	bills	that	Grandpa	Abner	had	sent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Which	would've	bought	me	a	Fort	Apache	toy	set	of	blue	U.S.	Cavalry	and Indians	in	red	and	yellow,	but	Ma	said	the	account	was	so	we	could	learn how	to	save.	Little	Bit	said,	"I'm	going	to	have	lots	of	money,"	and everyone	laughed,	including	the	banker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	we	drove	to	Artie	Drake's	office,	he	was	at	his	desk,	reading	a thick,	leather-bound	book.	He	heard	the	door,	looked	up,	then	closed	the book	on	an	envelope	to	mark	his	place.	"Hi,	y'all.	Come	on	in.	How	was the	night?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Night	was	fine.	Morning	was	a	little	rough." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake's	eyes	widened	as	he	saw	the	bandage	on	Digger,	asleep	in	Ma's arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"A	snake	bit	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said	quietly,	"I'm	sorry." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I	don't	know	what	got	into	Digger.	He	ran	up	to	it	before	we could	stop	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kids,"	said	Mr.	Drake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He'll	be	fine?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Dr.	Lamont	thinks	so." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a>"Good." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"We	just	wanted	to	tell	you	to	deposit	our	check.	We're	staying." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"Sure	you're	not	rushing	the	decision?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	laughed.	"You're	one	hell	of	a	salesman,	you	know	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	shrugged.	"There's	enough	business	in	the	world	dealing	with folks	who're	content.	No	need	to	make	money	off	folks	who	aren't." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	smiled	at	him.	"I	agree	one	hundred	per	cent." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"You	give	people	a	fair	deal.	If	they're	not	happy	with	it, that's	their	problem." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"So,	no	refunds	at	Dogland	if	you	don't	like	what	you	see?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	give	folks	what	you	said	you	would,	and	no	one'll	want	refunds." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	smiled.	"You	have	a	lot	of	faith	in	human	nature,	Luke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	a	bit.	Just	being	practical.	Never	give	anyone	grounds	to	use against	you,	and	you'll	get	by." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	looked	at	Ma,	then	back	at	Pa.	"Ah.	I	expect	you	could	make that	argument." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Have	to	make	it	some	other	time.	Work's	waiting.	If	you're	out our	way,	drop	in.	I	can	argue	all	night." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	laughed.	"That's	no	exaggeration.	Do	drop	by.	And	say	hi	to	Gwennie for	us.	Right,	Chris?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	my	boots.	"Okay." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>Pa	said,	"Mind	if	I	use	your	bathroom?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"Not	at	all."	He	pointed	toward	the	rear	of	the	office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Through	that	door." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thanks."	Pa	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	looked	at	Ma	and	said	gently,	"I'll	hold	off	another	day	on depositing	that	check,	if	you'd	like.	What	happened	to	your	boy--"	He shook	his	head.	"That'd	drive	a	lot	of	people	away." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"The	best	way	to	get	Luke	to	stay	somewhere	is	to	try	to	drive him	away." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	toilet	flushed.	Pa	came	out,	and	we	went	outside.	Mr.	Drake	followed us	to	the	car.	Seeing	Ethorne	in	the	backseat,	Mr.	Drake	said,	"Hey, Ethorne.	How's	things?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Like	silk,	Mist'	Artie.	Had	a	li'l	bump	over	a	seam,	but we	back	on	the	silk	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	Mis'	DeLyon?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	same	as	always." </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	waved	to	Mr.	Drake	as	we	drove	away.	Little	Bit	whispered,	"He	likes her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mr.	Drake?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Likes	Mis'	DeLyon?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>Little	Bit	shook	her	head.	"Ma." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	Everyone	liked	Ma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	Winn-Dixie	Grocery	Store,	Ethorne	said,	"I'll	watch	over	Digger while	you	shop." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again	Pa	looked	at	him,	but	didn't	say	anything.	Ma	said,	"That's	good of	you.	We	won't	be	long." </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	bought	groceries:	hamburger,	milk,	eggs,	white	bread,	Sugar	Frosted Flakes,	and	cans	of	Campbell's	soup,	corned	beef	hash,	cream	corn,	and string	beans.	I	lingered	by	a	wire	spinner	jammed	full	of	comic	books.	I knew	the	names	of	many	of	the	characters,	though	I	couldn't	read	them: Batman,	Superman,	Dennis	the	Menace,	Jerry	Lewis.	Ma	tugged	me	onward, so	I	followed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	car,	driving	home,	Little	Bit	and	I	ate	Baby	Ruth	bars	and	drank from	big	bottles	of	Grape	Ne-hi,	my	favorite.	Digger	slept	in	the	back on	a	blanket,	next	to	the	groceries,	and	Ethorne	sat	beside	us.	Ma,	in the	front,	said,	"Mr.	Drake	seems	like	a	nice	man." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	nodded.	"Oh,	Mist'	Artie's	a	fine	fellow." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	met	his	daughter,	but	not	his	wife." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	he	don'	got	no	wife.	Not	since	his	troubles." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Troubles?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	it's	not	a	secret,	'xactly.	It	was	a	long	time	ago." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>"Oh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Susan,	don't	make	the	man	tell	anything	he	doesn't	want	to." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"I	couldn't	make	anyone	tell	anything	they	didn't	want	to!	How could	I	possibly--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	laughed.	"You	can	make	anyone	agree	to	anything,	when	you	put	your mind	to	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	I	don't	try--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	reached	an	arm	along	the	top	of	the	bench	seat	and	gave	her	a	hug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Which	is	the	only	thing	that	saves	us	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well."	Ma	smiled	enough	to	say	she	had	forgiven	him,	though	she	did	not think	he	deserved	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Ain't	no	big	deal,	I	s'pect.	You	might	as	well	hear	'bout it	from	someone	who	likes	Mist'	Artie.	He	had	him	a	hard	time	in	the	war." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Korea?"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"World	War	Two,"	Ethorne	said.	"He	come	back	to	his	wife	and	his	job, but	he	acted	kind	of	strange.	He	went	off	to	the	V.A.	hospital	for	a year	or	so.	When	he	come	back,	his	wife	left	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Poor	man."	Then	she	said,	"What	about	Gwenny?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	shook	his	head.	"Her	Ma	drowned	a	year	or	two	later.	Girl	was sent	back	to	her	Pa.	He's	been	a	good	father	to	her.	Has	one	o'	my	girls for	a	housekeeper.	Sarah	cares	for	Gwenny	like	she	was	another	of	her</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a>own	babies." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma,	delighted,	said,	"You	don't	have	grandchildren,	Ethorne!"	She	added with	less	certainty,	"Do	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	laughed.	"Oh,	yes'm,	I	do.	A	passle." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Start	young	enough--"	He	grinned	at	Ethorne.	"I	don't	have	any that	I	know	about." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Luke,	honestly."	Ethorne	chuckled,	maybe	at	both	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	lifted	his	chin,	pointing	up	the	road.	"Who	wants	hamburgers?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	and	I	both	shouted,	"I	do,	I	do!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"You	don't	have	to	scream." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"All	right,"	and	turned	onto	the	gravel	parking	lot	in	front	of Gideon's	19-cent	Hamburgers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	rattled	to	a	stop,	Little	Bit	said,	"Ma	likes	Mister	Drake,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	squinted	at	her.	"Ma	likes	everyone."	Then	I	yanked	on	the	door handle,	and	we	ran	toward	the	source	of	God's	most	perfect	food. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gideon's	was	a	drive-in	carryout	hamburger	stand	with	a	porch	on	one side	covering	several	wooden	picnic	tables.	A	door	in	the	center	of	the building	opened	on	a	small	room	divided	by	a	long	counter.	On	one	side of	the	counter	was	space	enough	for	six	or	eight	people	to	stand	while placing	their	orders.	On	the	other	side	was	a	griddle,	a	refrigerator,	a wooden	cutting	table,	and	the	few	other	basics	that	a	fry	chef	requires. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a>Little	Bit	and	I	came	to	a	stop	as	soon	as	the	screen	door	closed	behind us.	On	the	back	wall,	between	two	draped	American	flags,	were	pictures of	Jesus.	There	were	Jesuses	on	place	mats,	post	cards,	and	cardboard fans.	There	were	little	paintings	of	Jesus	in	wooden	and	plastic	frames. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	newspaper	cutouts	of	black-and-white	pictures	of	paintings	of Jesus,	and	photos	of	people	dressed	to	look	like	Jesus,	and	photos	of things	that	looked	like	Jesus	if	you	squinted,	like	a	cow	with	markings on	its	side	that	resembled	a	bearded	man's	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind	the	counter	and	in	front	of	the	collage	was	a	short,	skinny, tanned	man	with	white	hair	in	a	crewcut.	Despite	the	heat,	he	wore	a long-sleeved	white	shirt	buttoned	to	his	neck.	He	saw	us	and	said,	"God bless	you,	children!	Welcome,	welcome!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	smiled,	saying,	"Hi.	We're	going	to	have	hamburgers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	the	Lord	surely	directed	you	to	the	right	place,"	said	the	small	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	walked	up	to	the	counter,	but	I	stayed	back,	studying	the Jesuses.	Some	cried,	and	some	laughed,	but	most	looked	as	if	they	had not	had	enough	sleep.	A	blackboard	hung	over	part	of	the	collage.	It	was covered	with	writing	that	did	not	look	to	me	like	a	menu,	because	there were	no	rows	of	items	with	corresponding	rows	of	prices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	screen	door	opened	again.	I	had	to	jump	forward	to	make	room	for	Pa and	Ma.	Pa	looked	around	the	room,	and	Ma	glanced	from	the	collage	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a>Pa.	The	small	man	said,	"Welcome.	Your	girl	says	you've	come	for hamburgers,	and	I'm	mighty	glad	to	hear	it.	That's	all	we	serve	that	you can	sink	your	teeth	into,	though	the	good	word's	available	if	you'd	like some	meat	for	your	soul,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded	at	the	collage	of	Jesuses.	"Friend	of	yours?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	yes,	sir,"	said	the	small	man.	"A	friend	of	yours,	too,	though	you may	not	know	it.	And	a	friend	of	the	Hamite	in	your	car,	as	well." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hamite?"	said	Pa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	small	man	nodded.	"The	unfortunate	race	with	God's	mark	on	their skin.	But	if	they	serve	dutifully	in	this	world,	they'll	be	rewarded	in the	next.	The	Negro	is	to	be	pitied,	not	despised." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	at	Pa	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So,"	said	the	small	man.	"What	can	I	fix	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	began,	"I	don't	know--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	cut	him	off	with,	"A	hamburger,	please,	an'	a	starberry	milk shake!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We're	your	new	neighbors,"	Ma	said.	"We	bought	the	Hawkins	land." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	did?	I'm	delighted!"	The	small	man	wiped	his	hand	on	a	dish	cloth and	offered	his	palm	to	Pa.	"I'm	Gideon	Shale,	sir.	If	there's	anything, anything	at	all,	I	might	help	you	with,	you	let	me	know.	I've	done	a	few things	in	my	time." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a>Pa	glanced	at	Ma	as	he	took	the	man's	hand.	"Luke	Nix.	This	is	Susan." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	held	out	her	hand,	and	Mr.	Shale	said,	"A	pleasure,"	as	he	took	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"That's	Chris	and	Little	Bit." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	you	look	like	fine	helpers	for	your	parents!"	Mr.	Shale	shook hands	with	us,	too.	His	fingers	felt	like	talons,	strong	and	fleshless, but	his	hand	shook	slightly	in	my	grip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged	at	his	statement.	Little	Bit	said,	"I'm	going	to	have	any	dog I	want." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	are?"	said	Mr.	Shale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Have	you	decided	what	kind	you	want?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	nodded.	"Every	kind!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Shale	laughed.	Pa	said,	"We're	building	a	tourist	attraction.	When we're	done,	we'll	have	over	a	hundred	and	twenty	breeds	of	dog	on display.	American	Kennel	Association	recognizes	a	hundred	and	thirteen currently,	but	in	the	world,	there's	more'n	four	hundred	breeds.	We'll have	plenty	of	room	to	expand." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Shale	nodded.	"mastiff,	greyhound,	mongrel	grim,	hound	or	spaniel, brach	or	lym;	or	bobtail	tike,	or	trundle-tail--"	He	stopped	abruptly and	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I	don't	recognize	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>"Shakespeare.	The	other	good	book.	Though	neither	book	has	much	good	to say	about	dogs,	I	fear."	Mr.	Shale	shrugged.	"You	came	for	food	for	the body,	I	believe." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"Six	hamburgers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mine	plain,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	can't	make	you	a	milk	shake,"	Mr.	Shale	told	Little	Bit.	"Freezer broke	down,	and	the	Lord	hasn't	provided	a	new	one,	yet.	I	suspect	He's waiting	for	me	to	pull	the	motor.	We	have	milk,	soda	pop,	and	coffee." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Four	milks."	Pa	stepped	outside	and	called,	"Ethorne!	Milk	or	pop?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Anything	be	fine,	Mist'	Luke,"	Ethorne	called	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What'd	be	finest?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	laughed.	"Co'cola	be	finest,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	stepped	back	inside.	"And	one	Coke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Coming	right	up."	Mr.	Shale	opened	the	refrigerator	and	took	out	a metal	tray	full	of	ground	red	meat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	at	the	blackboard	and	read	aloud,	"It	is	easier	for	a	camel	to go	through	the	eye	of	a	needle,	than	for	a	rich	man	to	enter	into	the kingdom	of	God.	Matthew,	Nineteen,	twenty-four."	Ma	glanced	at	Pa	again as	he	said,	"Interesting	thing	for	a	businessman	to	have	on	his	wall." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	I	change	the	teaching	every	week,"	said	Mr.	Shale,	shaping hamburger	patties	in	his	hands.	"That	one's	to	remind	me	that	we	make</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a>money	to	live,	not	the	other	way	around." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sounds	un-American."	Pa	nodded	toward	the	two	American	flags	flanking the	Jesuses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Shale	laughed,	pointed	at	cutout	letters	among	the	pictures	of Jesus,	and	read,	"One	nation,	under	GOD."	The	word	"GOD"	was	surrounded with	gold	foil	stars.	Mr.	Shale	dropped	six	patties	onto	the	grill,	each adding	its	sizzle	to	the	noise	as	it	landed.	"Nothing	wrong	with	making money,	so	long	as	you	spend	some	on	Jesus." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hadn't	heard	he	was	hurting	for	cash,"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Luke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Shale	said,	"Oh,	I	don't	mind	some	funning,	Mrs.	Nix.	There	are	many ways	to	spend	money	on	the	Lord,	if	you	seek	them	out.	There's	always someone	doing	His	work	who	could	use	a	little	help." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've	read	the	Bible,"	Pa	said.	"I	don't	remember	Jesus	asking	for handouts." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Shale	frowned	at	Pa,	then	flipped	each	of	the	burgers,	producing	new explosions	of	sound	and	increasing	the	smell	of	cooking	meat.	As	he placed	hamburger	buns	on	the	grill	to	toast,	he	said,	"We're	all	frail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	do	what	we	can	for	those	we	can." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	at	Pa	and	said,	"That's	what	we	all	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	told	Mr.	Shale,	"You	may	be	a	little	hard	on	yourself.	I	heard	there</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a>was	a	gate	in	Jerusalem	called	the	Eye	of	the	Needle.	And	it	wasn't impossible	to	get	a	camel	through	the	gate.	It	was	just	hard." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Shale	shook	his	head	and	placed	six	paper	napkins	on	the	counter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've	heard	that,	too.	I	doubt	the	Lord	was	unaware	of	the	implications of	what	He	said	when	He	said	it."	Mr.	Shale	removed	the	buns,	placed them	on	the	napkins,	squirted	five	with	ketchup,	then	assembled	the burgers	and	folded	the	napkins	around	them.	"Want	these	to	go?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"We'll	eat	them	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	could	eat	a	horse,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	that's	too	bad,"	said	Mr.	Shale.	"These	are	all	cow."	He	stacked the	burgers	onto	a	cardboard	tray	and	set	that	on	the	counter.	As	he opened	the	refrigerator	to	remove	four	cartons	of	milk	and	a	Coca	Cola bottle,	he	said,	"If	talking	about	Jesus	disturbs	you,	let	me	know.	I'll be	happy	to	quit	my	prattling.	Jesus	comes	when	you're	ready	for	Him.	I can	ask	you	to	receive	Him,	but	only	you	can	open	your	heart." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Tell	you	what.	You	don't	try	to	convince	me	you're	right,	and I	won't	try	to	convince	you	you're	wrong.	Is	that	a	deal?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Shale	laughed.	"No,	Lucifer,	that's	never	a	deal.	But	my	wife,	bless her	soul,	always	said	I	never	knew	when	to	let	folks	be.	You	have	a	good meal,	hear?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Will	do."	Pa	placed	a	five-dollar	bill	on	the	counter. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a>Mr.	Shale	started	to	hand	Pa	his	money	back.	"We're	neighbors." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shook	his	head.	"That's	right.	This	way,	on	slow	days,	we'll	each know	we	got	at	least	one	customer	nearby." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Shale	smiled	and	counted	out	Pa's	change.	"God	bless	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bye,"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"God	bless	you,"	Ma	repeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"God	bless	you,"	Little	Bit	stated	firmly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"G'	b--"	I	began,	and	finished,	"bye." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	walked	out	into	the	sun,	Pa	said,	"Why'd	you	introduce	us	right off?	Old	coot'll	be	over	to	convert	us	within	twenty-four	hours." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	our	neighbor,	Luke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	want	to	be	nice	to	him,	you	be	nice	to	him.	I'll	have	work	to	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	brought	Digger	out	of	the	car.	Ma	carried	Digger	to	a	picnic table;	he	ate	half	of	his	hamburger	before	he	fell	asleep	again.	Pa	ate the	other	half.	Afterwards,	he	said,	"Well,	I	suppose	I	can	always listen	to	ol'	Gideon	for	the	sake	of	a	good	hamburger." </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	we	returned	to	our	land,	Pa	and	Ethorne	looked	in	the	grass	for the	dead	snake.	The	head	and	body	were	both	gone.	Ethorne	said,	"Critter got	it,"	but	he	sounded	doubtful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	patted	my	shirt	pocket.	I	still	had	a	fang	to	prove	the	snake	had	been here.	I	didn't	show	it	to	anyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>Chapter	Four</p>
<p class="calibre1">Building	in	Blood</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	1959,	these	things	happened	in	my	parents'	world:	Ninety	miles	away from	the	United	States,	Fidel	Castro's	Communist	forces	defeated	Cuba's corrupt	dictator	and	expropriated	U.S.-owned	sugar	mills.	The	Soviet Union	sent	the	first	rocket	to	the	moon.	Alaska	and	Hawaii	became	the forty-ninth	and	fiftieth	U.S.	states.	Raymond	Chandler,	Frank	Lloyd Wright,	Cecil	B.	De	Mille,	Errol	Flynn,	Buddy	Holly,	and	Billie	Holiday died.	China	crushed	a	Tibetan	revolt,	and	Tibet's	spiritual	leader,	the Dalai	Lama,	fled	to	India.	"Ben	Hur"	won	the	Academy	Award.	"Tom	Dooley" </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	"Mack	the	Knife"	dominated	the	radio	waves.	For	the	first	time,	the number	of	Americans	who	had	died	in	automobile	accidents	(more	than	1.25</p>
<p class="calibre1">million)	was	greater	than	the	number	who	had	died	in	all	previous American	wars.	The	U.S.	Postmaster	General	banned	Lady	Chatterley's Lover	from	the	mail.	President	Eisenhower	sent	troops	to	crush	strikes by	U.S.	steelworkers	and	longshoremen.	Los	Angeles	won	baseball's	World Series.	Jack	Nicklaus	won	the	U.S.	Golf	Association	amateur championship.	The	star	contestant	on	"21",	America's	most	popular television	game	show,	admitted	that	the	show's	producers	had	given	him answers	to	their	questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	world's	events	happened	near	the	cinder	block	motel	unit	that	was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a>home.	Ethorne	and	a	crew	of	young	men	cleared	the	ashes	of	the	house that	had	burned	before	we	arrived,	and	then	they	began	cutting	back	the jungle	around	us.	Ma	and	several	hired	black	women	cleaned	the restaurant,	then	Ethorne	and	his	crew	painted	it	pink.	A	swingset appeared	beside	our	new	home,	a	replacement	for	the	one	we	had	lost	in New	Orleans,	and	Little	Bit,	Digger,	and	I	learned	how	playing	was different	in	Florida:</p>
<p class="calibre1">When	sand	spurs	are	green,	you	can	crush	them	between	the	tips	of	your fingers,	if	you're	careful.	When	they're	brown,	the	spines	will	pierce your	skin,	hurting	when	they	enter,	hurting	while	they're	in	you, hurting	again	when	you	pluck	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	ants	are	busy	specks	that	scurry	away	when	you	kick	apart	their hills.	Some	ants	are	fire	ants	whose	bites	burn	like	a	lit	match. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	snakes	are	harmless,	but	every	poisonous	snake	in	North	America lives	in	northern	Florida.	Rattlers,	water	moccasins,	and	copperheads are	easy	to	know	by	their	fangs.	The	difference	between	the	poisonous coral	snake	and	the	harmless	scarlet	king	snake	is	subtle;	it	lies	in the	pattern	of	red,	black,	and	yellow	rings	around	their	bodies.	Ma taught	us,	"Red	on	yellow,	kill	the	fellow.	Red	on	black,	poison	lack." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	to	tell	an	adult	whenever	I	saw	a	snake,	no	matter	what	I	thought it	might	be.	Little	Bit	loved	to	hunt	for	grass	snakes.	When	she	found</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a>one,	she	called,	"Come,	Chris-a-fer!	Come,	Digger!	Nice	snakey!	See?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	always	waddled	to	her	as	quickly	as	he	could	to	see	what	made	her laugh.	His	fears	were	reserved	for	large,	fanged	monsters	with	heads larger	than	Pa's	fist.	I	always	stood	back	and	pretended	I	was	bored	by mere	grass	snakes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dogs	began	arriving	before	construction	had	begun	on	the	kennels.	The first	was	a	Rough	Coated	Collie.	Little	Bit	saw	her	and	raced	toward her,	yelling,	"Lassie!	It's	Lassie!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	second	was	a	white	and	brown	Pointer	that	liked	to	jump	up	and	bark when	he	saw	people	he	didn't	know.	I	heard	the	barking	and	stepped behind	Ma.	Pa	saw	me	and	said,	"Christopher,	come	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"He	needs	time	to	get	used	to	the	dog." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"That's	what	I'm	going	to	arrange." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	entire	family	was	watching.	Digger	and	Little	Bit	had	stepped	back when	the	Pointer	barked,	but	Pa	had	not	noticed	them.	I	took	a	few	steps forward	as	if	I	had	merely	been	walking	around	Ma	to	get	a	better	look at	the	dog. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come	on,"	Pa	said	with	less	patience.	"He	won't	hurt	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Chris	doesn't	know	that,"	Ma	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	glanced	at	her.	"He	will."	Ma	looked	away	as	Pa	said,	"Hold	out	your hand.	Toward	the	dog." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>I	moved	my	hand	about	six	inches	forward.	The	snake	had	enclosed Digger's	fist.	A	big	dog	could	swallow	my	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	patted	the	Pointer.	"His	name's	Beauregard.	He's	not	going	to	hurt you,	Chris.	You	do	what	I	say,	and	you'll	know	how	to	tell	if	any	dog might	bite." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded,	but	I	didn't	move	my	arm	any	closer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Turn	your	hand	over	so	he	can	see	you	don't	have	anything	in	it.	Dogs usually	bite	when	they're	scared.	If	they	can't	see	what's	in	your	hand, they	don't	know	if	you're	going	to	hit	them	or	something." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	showed	my	palm.	Beauregard	licked	it,	and	I	jumped	back.	Little	Bit and	Digger	laughed,	then	so	did	I.	Beauregard	began	licking	my	face,	and I	had	to	use	both	arms	to	hold	him	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Well,	Beauregard's	too	fast	to	be	a	good	example.	But	anytime you're	dealing	with	a	dog	you	don't	know,	let	it	smell	you	so	it'll	know you	don't	plan	to	hurt	it.	If	a	dog	growls	at	you,	just	draw	your	hand back	slowly.	Never	show	you're	scared,	or	it'll	try	to	chase	you	away." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	and	let	Beauregard	lick	my	hands.	It	had	never	occurred	to	me that	something	large	might	be	afraid	of	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	kept	the	Collie	and	the	Pointer	chained	to	the	porch	in	front	of	the house	so	they	wouldn't	run	off	or	get	on	the	highway.	That	seemed	a reasonable	solution	until	a	blond	short-haired	Chihuahua	arrived. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>Ma	said,	"You	can't	leave	that	little	thing	out	all	night." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"On	the	farm,	we	never	had	dogs	in	the	house." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Daddy	and	Mother	have	always	had	house	dogs." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gretel,"	said	Little	Bit,	naming	Grandma	and	Grandpa's	elderly	Dachshund. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I	don't	want	a	dog	in	my	damn	house." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"What	if	something	happens	to	him?	Mickey's	a	champion.	If	we had	to	pay	the	breeder	what	he's	worth--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Champion	Chihuahua,"	Pa	said.	"Champion	yappy	little	lapdog." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yappy	lappy	dog,"	said	Little	Bit,	petting	Mickey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	night,	when	we	went	into	Ma	and	Pa's	room	to	watch	"Gunsmoke"	on the	secondhand	TV	that	Pa	had	bought	at	a	church	sale,	Mickey	was	in	a cardboard	box	that	Ma	had	cut	down	and	lined	with	rags.	Pa	looked	at Mickey	and	said,	"All	right.	I	don't	want	a	dog	in	my	damn	bed." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Fine."	All	during	"Gunsmoke,"	while	Marshall	Dillon	and	Miss Kitty	maintained	civilization	in	Dodge	City,	Mickey	kept	jumping	onto the	chenille	bedspread.	At	first,	we	kids	laughed	at	the	way	Ma	would catch	Mickey	and	set	him	down	with	a	shake	of	her	finger	and	a	fiercely whispered,	"Stay!	Good	dog!	Stay!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	it	quit	being	funny.	Mickey	would	stand	on	the	tiles,	then circle	the	bed	and	bound	back	up.	Finally,	Pa	said,	"Jesus,	Susan,	will you	just	hold	that	damn	dog	so	it'll	quit	jumping	around?"	Ma	clutched</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a>Mickey	like	a	baby	through	the	rest	of	the	show.	He	licked	Ma's	and Little	Bit's	faces,	and	after	a	few	minutes,	they	laughed.	Pa,	Digger, and	I	watched	"Gunsmoke"	as	if	the	Chihuahua	did	not	exist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fourth	dog	to	arrive	was	Captain,	the	best	Norwegian	Elkhound	that ever	lived.	I	don't	know	who	decided	Captain	was	my	dog,	if	I	did	or Captain	did,	or	if	Ma	or	Pa	decided	that	each	of	us	kids	should	have	a dog	that	we	could	consider	our	own--though	most	of	the	dogs	were	on	loan to	Dogland,	it	was	understood	that	they	would	stay	with	us	as	long	as they	lived.	Captain	was	gray	and	shaggy	and	happy	and	brave,	the	kind	of dog	who	pulled	Sergeant	Preston	of	the	Yukon	through	the	snow	to	save lost	people	and	capture	bad	men.	Captain	loved	to	lick	my	face	when	I petted	him,	and	he	always	thought	it	was	wonderful	to	see	me,	and	I always	knew	it	was	wonderful	to	see	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>Shortly	after	my	fourth	birthday,	I	was	playing	in	the	gravel	parking lot	near	the	restaurant,	building	a	moat	around	the	Fort	Apache	set	that Grandpa	Abner	had	sent	me,	when	something	large	rolled	across	the	rubble behind	me.	I	turned,	gasped,	and	scrambled	backwards,	caving	in	part	of the	trench	I	had	dug	and	burying	a	blue	cavalryman	who	had	been	about	to saber	a	bright	yellow	tomahawk-wielding	redskin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	ancient	green	pick-up	truck	had	coasted	in	behind	me.	The	door	opened quickly	and	quietly,	slicing	the	air	within	inches	of	my	head.	The driver	stepped	out	as	the	door	swung	wide.	I	saw	engineer	boots	and shapeless	work	trousers,	and	I	thought	this	was	Pa	until	I	heard	the man's	voice:	"Hey,	boy.	Careful	where	you	play.	Might	get	hurt." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	walked	away	so	quickly	that	I	barely	had	time	to	note	the	ways	in which	he	was	not	Pa.	He	had	a	north-Florida	accent.	He	was	short	and round	like	Santa	Claus.	His	skin	was	reddish-brown,	and	he	wore	a	work shirt	that	matched	his	trousers.	He	carried	himself	with	a	military erectness	that	I	envied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stopped	under	the	shade	of	the	Heart	Tree.	A	few	hundred	yards	away, Pa	and	Ethorne	were	clearing	land	with	several	young	men	that	Ethorne called	his	boys.	The	stranger	said,	"That	your	pa	with	the	niggers?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	my	Pa,	but	I	had	been	told	that	Ethorne,	James,	and	Seth	were</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>not	supposed	to	be	called	niggers.	I	had	also	been	told	not	to	correct adults.	I	stared	at	the	workers	as	if	I	had	never	seen	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	too	scared	to	talk,"	said	the	man,	"you	just	nod,	hear?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	and	whispered,	"That's	my	Pa." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	laughed.	Ma	came	out	of	the	restaurant	with	a	wet	sponge	in	one hand;	she	and	Mayella,	one	of	Ethorne's	girls,	had	been	scrubbing	walls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	was	helping	them.	She	followed	Ma	with	a	small	silver,	blue, and	green	metal	beach	bucket	full	of	sudsy	water.	Ma	smiled	and	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We're	not	open	yet." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	touched	the	bill	of	his	cap.	"I	know,	ma'm.	That	your	daughter?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	said,	"I	figured	she	was.	She's	near	as	pretty	as	you.	My	name's Tom	Greenleaf,	but	they	call	me	Handyman.	I	hear	your	husband's	got	work needs	doin'."	He	smiled.	"Ain't	much	I	can't	handle	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	frowned.	"You'll	have	to	speak	with	Luke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handyman	touched	his	cap	again.	"Will	do,	ma'm."	He	looked	at	the	woods, then	said,	"Say,	you	folks	ain't	seen	no	sign	o'	boar,	have	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Excuse	me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Boar,	ma'm.	Been	some	good	hunts	through	this	land.	Got	one	hog	not long	ago	what	weighed	near	two	hun'ed	an'	fifty	pounds." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma's	eyes	widened,	and	she	looked	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a>Handyman	smiled.	"One	I'd	like	to	get	is	s'posed	to	be	more'n	three hun'ed.	Big	fellow	the	niggers	call	Blanche." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Blanche?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes'm.	A	French-talkin'	nigger	come	out	of	the	woods	a	few	years	back, all	tore	up	and	screamin'	something	wild.	Your	neighbor,	ol'	man	Shale, an'	Preacher	Jones,	the	minister	up	at	All	Souls--that's	the	nigger church	in	Dickison--found	him.	Jones	says	there	was	a	big	ol'	boar	in the	bushes,	an'	that	boar	just	watched	him	and	Shale	put	the	French nigger	in	the	back	of	his	truck.	French	nigger	said	somethin'	about Blanche	an'	the	horror	an'	like	that,	all	in	French,	which	is	Greek	to ol'	man	Shale	and	Preacher	Jones.	That	was	all	anyone	ever	got	out	of him.	That	nigger's	off	at	the	crazy	farm	now.	No	one	ever	figured	out where	he	was	from	or	what	he	was	doin'	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good	Lord,"	Ma	said.	"The	poor	man." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handyman	shrugged.	"Preacher	Jones	an'	ol'	man	Shale	both	been	known	to take	a	drink	now	an'	then.	Might	be	you	can	only	find	that	boar	half-way through	a	jug	o'	shine.	But	if	you	see	any	sign	of	a	big	ol'	boar,	le' </p>
<p class="calibre1">me	know,	hear?	I	got	a	pack	of	hounds	that'll	track	and	hold	anything that	runs	on	this	Earth." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"I	haven't	noticed	anything	like	a	boar	around	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"With	all	this	activity	you	got	now,	you're	not	like	to,	neither.	Don't</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a>you	fret	on	it	none,	ma'm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	nodded.	Handyman	touched	his	cap	again	and	walked	toward	Pa	and	the workers.	Little	Bit	said,	"What's	a	boar?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"It's	a	wild	pig	with	big	tusks.	Teeth	that	stick	out	from	its mouth.	If	you	see	any	wild	animals,	you	go	inside	the	nearest	house immediately,	understand?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	and	I	nodded.	Ma	went	back	into	the	restaurant,	but	Little Bit	stood	on	the	green	cement	sidewalk,	squinting	in	the	sunlight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thinking	about	wolves	and	the	three	little	pigs,	I	trailed	Handyman	from about	thirty	feet	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	days'	toil	with	a	tractor	and	bulldozer	had	carved	wide,	muddy swatches	into	the	woods.	Pa	and	the	negro	men	were	working	at	the	edge of	an	island	of	jungle.	Pa	had	his	shirt	off.	His	shoulders	were	red from	the	sun,	but	I	knew	from	our	trips	to	the	beach	that	what	burned	Ma or	me	would	only	tan	Pa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	and	the	hired	men	were	hauling	a	felled	tree	out	of	the	brush.	They were	sweating,	and	their	breaths	came	in	gasps,	but	they	all	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	grunted	to	Pa,	"This	goin'	make--a	mighty	nice--resting	bench, Mist'	Luke.	Folks	come--from	miles	'round--just	to	set	on--this	here	log." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa's	laugh	was	interrupted	by	Handyman	saying,	"Got	them	boys	working pretty	good." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>The	negroes	quit	smiling.	Pa	looked	at	Handyman.	"They're	hard-working men."	He	and	the	others	didn't	slow	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handyman	grunted	agreement.	"Long	as	you	keep	after	'em."	He	grabbed	a dirt-encrusted	root	to	help	carry	the	tree	toward	several	others	that that	lay	in	a	pile,	waiting	for	Pa	to	decide	how	they	might	be	useful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handyman	said,	"How	you,	Ethorne?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Can't	complain,	Mist'	Greenleaf." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Good	enough,"	and	everyone	dropped	the	tree.	Pa	pulled	a handkerchief	out	of	his	back	pocket,	swabbed	his	forehead,	then	looked at	Handyman	again.	"Help	you	with	something?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	sir,"	said	Handyman.	"Might	be	I	can	he'p	you.	I	hear	you	might	be needin'	a	'lectrician.	I'm	Tom	Greenleaf.	Folks	call	me	Handyman,	'cause that's	what	I	try	to	be." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	held	out	his	hand.	"Luke	Nix."	As	the	men	shook,	Pa	said,	"We're hardly	ready	for	an	electrician.	Got	to	finish	laying	this	out,	maybe get	a	little	more	landscaping	done	first." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	putting	in	dog	runs,"	said	Handyman,	"you'll	need	plumbing	work.	I do	that,	too.	You	plannin'	on	some	serious	landscaping--"	He	gestured toward	the	Heart	Tree	by	extending	two	fingers,	making	a	pistol	of	his hand.	"--I	work	with	dynamite." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	smiled.	"Wife's	set	on	keeping	that	old	tree." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a>"Give	you	more	room	to	park	cars." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	we	start	turning	customers	away	'cause	we're	out	of	parking	places, you'll	get	the	first	call." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handyman	laughed.	"Glad	to	hear	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Check	back	Monday,	if	you	want.	We	may	be	ready	to	string	a	few	yard lights	by	then." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Will	do."	Handyman	nodded	at	Ethorne,	Seth,	and	James.	"See	you	boys." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	smiled.	"Sure	'nough." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handyman	looked	at	me.	"I	got	a	boy	'bout	your	age.	Might	be	you	two could	play	together	sometime.	How'd	you	like	that?"	I	shrugged	and looked	at	my	boots.	All	of	the	men	chuckled.	Handyman	said,	"Well,"	and started	to	walk	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	called,	"Tell	you	what.	I'll	let	you	know	what	we're	planning.	If	you can	get	up	an	estimate--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Easy,"	said	Handyman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	at	Ethorne,	then	at	the	woods	where	they'd	been	working. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Anything	in	there	you	think	is	pretty,	let	it	stand.	But	all	the	weeds and	most	of	those	bushes	have	to	go.	I	want	to	be	able	to	get	a	riding mower	in	there,	maybe	plant	some	flowers.	We'll	make	Busch	Gardens	look like	some	old	lady's	back	yard." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"You	got	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a>Pa	and	Handyman	headed	toward	Handyman's	truck.	Seth,	the	youngest	of the	negro	men,	watched	Handyman	and	whispered,	"Damn	cracker."	Though Seth	and	James	were	both	handsome	and	wiry	like	Ethorne,	James	was	tall and	dark	like	a	telephone	pole,	and	Seth	was	short	and	copper-skinned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	looked	at	me,	then	shrugged	and	told	Seth,	"Boy,	pray	you	never meet	a	worse	white	than	the	Handyman." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	said,	"Isn't	a	matter	of	better	or	worse."	He	wiped	his	dark-framed glasses	on	the	tail	of	his	shirt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh?"	James	gave	a	low	laugh.	"Say	what	it	be,	collegeboy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne,	frowning,	shook	his	head,	but	Seth	was	looking	at	me.	He squatted	on	his	heels	and	said,	"Hey,	cowboy.	What's	the	only	good	Indian?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	grinned	and	drew	my	broken	cap	pistol.	"Only	good	Injun	is	a	dead Injun!	Pow-pow-pow-pow!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	and	James	laughed.	Seth,	standing,	said,	"Some	days	I	wish	this world	had	nothing	but	good	whites." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	asked	me,	"You	like	Mis'	DeLyon,	Chris?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	On	hot	afternoons,	Ma	or	Pa	or	both	of	them	would	take	us	kids to	the	Fountain	of	Youth,	and	Mis'	DeLyon	would	let	us	play	in	her wading	pool. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Mis'	DeLyon's	an	Indian." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	squinted	at	him,	then	announced,	"Pa's	part	Indian,	so	I'm	part</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>Indian."	I	patted	my	hand	over	my	mouth.	"Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	smiled.	"You	goin'	shoot	yourself?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	grinned	and	fired	several	times	toward	the	woods	with	my	cap	pistol. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pow-pow-pow!"	Then	I	holstered	my	pistol,	squatted,	and	shot	an imaginary	bow.	"Whoo!	Whoo!"	Then	I	grunted,	clutched	my	chest,	and	fell full-length	onto	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	clapped.	"Marlon	Brando's	eating	his	heart	out." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Paul	Robeson	be	feelin'	a	mite	jealous,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	said,	"John	Wayne	got	nothing	on	that	boy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	opened	my	eyes	and	grinned	at	James.	John	Wayne	made	the	cowboy	movies that	Pa	and	I	loved.	John	Wayne	was	a	real	actor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"We	best	be	gettin'	to	work." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	nodded	slowly.	"Got	to	show	the	white	man	we	ain't	no	lazy	niggers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ain't	that	right?"	He	stared	at	Ethorne	and	Ethorne	stared	back,	like gunfighters	facing	off	in	a	dusty	street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	poked	Seth's	shoulder.	"You	ain't	'bout	to	show	nobody	nothin' </p>
<p class="calibre1">about	workin',	collegeboy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	slid	his	gaze	to	James.	"You're	just--"	Then	he	laughed.	"About	to be	proven	wrong,	farmboy."	He	snatched	up	a	machete	that	was	lying beside	a	sickle	and	a	scythe,	and	he	headed	toward	the	woods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	grabbed	the	scythe	and	followed	Seth.	Stooping	for	the	sickle, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a>Ethorne	said,	"Your	mama	be	happiest	if	you	play	up	near	the	restaurant, Kit	Carson." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	saluted,	bringing	my	left	hand	up	above	my	eyebrow	and	touching	my coonskin	cap.	Even	if	he	didn't	have	a	TV	show,	Kit	Carson	was	as	good as	Daniel	Boone	and	Davy	Crockett;	Pa	had	said	so.	Even	better,	his first	name	was	my	first	name.	"Ethorne,	sir?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	began	to	sharpen	the	sickle	with	a	stone	from	the	pocket	of	his overalls.	"Yes,	Mast'	Nix?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kit's	a	good	name." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	is	a	fact." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Would	people	call	me	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You'd	like	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	you	asked	'em	nice,	they	might." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	and	ran	toward	my	Fort	Apache	play	set.	A	little	later,	Mayella called	me	in	for	lunch.	I	ran	into	the	men's	washroom,	scrubbed	my hands,	then	ran	into	the	restaurant	kitchen	by	the	back	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Whoa!"	said	Mayella.	"Hurr'cane	just	blew	in." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	grinned	at	her.	Mayella	reminded	me	of	Aunt	Jemima	on	the	pancake	box and	the	syrup	bottle,	except	she	was	younger,	darker,	and	not	quite	as stout. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>Ma	said,	"Be	careful	when	you	come	inside,	Chris.	You	might've	hit someone	with	the	door." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Your	mother's	talking	to	you,	Chris." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Yessir,"	then,	"yes,	ma'm,"	and	ran	to	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Did	you	wash?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Yes,	ma'm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	laughed.	"Didn't	bathe." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	said,	"Got	dirt	on	the	back	of	yo'	head.	What	was	you	doin',	anyway?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Injuns	shot	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	up	from	a	copy	of	Newsweek	and	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"Really?"	and	Digger	stared.	When	Ma	said,	"No,	Chris is	just	fooling,"	Little	Bit	seemed	disappointed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	grabbed	my	shoulders	and	swung	me	onto	a	chair.	"Now,	you	stay right	there--"	She	turned	away	to	reach	for	a	wash	rag,	and	when	she did,	I	saw	down	the	collar	of	her	white	shirt.	The	skin	of	her	back	was striped	with	black,	shiny	tissue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	poked	my	finger	onto	the	top	edge	of	the	uppermost	mark.	It	felt	hard and	cool	beneath	my	finger.	"What's	that,	Mayella?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	stepped	forward	quickly,	saying	nothing.	She	bumped	against	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a>counter,	and	everyone	looked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"What'd	you	do,	Chris?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	my	boots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	gave	a	small	laugh.	"Oh,	Chris	just	saw	where	my	back	got	cut up."	She	lifted	the	tail	of	my	cap	and	scrubbed	the	back	of	my	head	with her	wash	rag,	hard	enough	that	it	hurt	a	little.	I	didn't	mind,	'cause	I knew	she	was	upset	by	what	I'd	done,	though	I	didn't	know	why. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"What	happened,	Mayella?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Don't	pester	Mayella,	you	two." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	said,	"That's	all	right,	ma'm.	I	was	somewheres	at	the	wrong time.	That's	how	it	usually	is	when	you	get	yourself	hurt." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	nodded.	"Hear	that,	Chris?	Letitia?	You	always	want	to	be	careful, wherever	you	are." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Being	careful	isn't	always	enough." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	glanced	at	him,	then	shrugged	and	begin	removing	golden-brown grilled	cheese	sandwiches	from	the	griddle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	at	Little	Bit	and	me.	"But	there	are	enough	mistakes	being made	in	the	world.	You	don't	need	to	add	to	them." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a>For	her	birthday,	Pa	had	bought	Ma	a	ditto	machine	so	she	could	send newsletters	to	friends,	family,	and	Dogland's	shareholders.	In	her first,	she	wrote,	"I	smashed	my	pointer	finger,	right	hand,	in	car	door a	week	ago	and	am	sill	having	a	kickens	of	a	time	using	it,	so	please forgive	rrrors."	I	remember	Ma's	yell	of	pain,	and	my	dismay:	Kids	are supposed	to	suffer;	parents	are	supposed	to	soothe	them.	I	stood	back	as Little	Bit	and	Digger	ran	up	beside	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa,	on	the	other	side	of	the	car,	said,	"What	in	hell--"	and	ran	around to	our	side.	When	he	saw	Ma's	hand,	he	stared,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	whispered,	"It's	all	right."	Her	finger	was	bleeding	and	ugly.	Red drops	fell	onto	the	driveway,	staining	the	gravel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"What'd	you	do	that	for,	Susan?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	shook	her	head.	Tears	formed	at	the	corners	of	her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Jesus.	You	need	to	bandage	that	up,"	and	he	led	her	into	the house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Following	them,	Little	Bit	said,	"Does	that	hurt?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"It'll	be	fine." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	looked	at	Little	Bit.	She	told	him,	"Don't	worry,	Dig-dig. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mommy'll	be	fine." </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Ma	and	Pa	came	out	of	the	bathroom,	Ma's	finger	was	covered	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>bulbous	white	gauze	bandage.	Ma	said,	"Pretty	funny-looking,	huh?	I've got	a	clown	on	my	finger."	She	waggled	it	once.	Digger	yowled,	beginning to	cry	fiercely.	Ma	scooped	him	up	in	a	hug	and	said	that	everything	was really	fine,	really. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later,	when	Little	Bit	and	Digger	had	gone	to	play	on	the	porch	and	Pa had	gone	outside	to	work,	I	said,	"Does	it	still	hurt,	Ma?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Not	enough	for	you	to	worry	about,"	and	she	kissed	the	top	of my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	afternoon,	we	all	went	swimming	at	the	Fountain	of	Youth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Afterwards,	Ma	said	her	finger	hardly	bothered	her	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	changing	of	Ma's	bandage	became	a	daily	ritual	for	us	kids.	When	Pa was	present,	he	stayed	on	the	far	side	of	the	room,	reading	or	watching TV.	Once	he	said,	"Bunch	of	ghouls."	Ma	said,	"They're	curious."	Pa	said nothing	more	about	it.	Over	the	next	days,	we	watched	the	finger	swell, the	bruise	darken,	the	nail	fall	off,	the	skin	turn	pink	again,	and	the new	nail	grow	in	clean	and	straight.	It	was	better	than	television. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a>Ma	and	Pa	told	us	we	weren't	supposed	to	play	in	the	front	seat	of	the station	wagon	when	no	adults	were	in	the	car,	but	we	could	play	in	the back.	Sometimes	the	backseat	was	my	stage	coach,	sometimes	it	was	Little Bit's	house,	and	often	it	was	merely	a	place	where	we	could	sit	or	lie out	of	the	summer	sun.	Little	Bit	liked	to	crawl	in	and	out	through	the car	window.	Sometimes	she	would	perch	there,	watching	traffic	on	the highway	or	birds	over	the	woods,	or	maybe	dreaming	of	wild	rides	with laughing	people,	or	maybe	just	basking	in	sunshine	and	a	rich	sense	of accomplishment.	No	one	knows	why,	after	weeks	of	playing	safely,	she fell	backwards	out	of	the	car	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	spotted	Little	Bit	lying	still	on	the	gravel,	and	she	screamed once.	Pa,	Ethorne,	Seth,	James,	and	all	the	other	workers	came	running, and	so	did	Ma.	Mayella,	crouching	over	Little	Bit,	said,	"Sweet	Lord Jesus,"	and	Ma,	hurrying	near,	said,	"Oh,	Letitia!"	and	Pa,	running	from the	construction	site,	said,	"What	in	hell	happened!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn't	know.	Digger	and	I	had	been	by	the	Heart	Tree,	building	dirt roads	so	our	plastic	cars	could	run	around	the	tree's	thick	roots.	I	was the	oldest	person	present	when	Little	Bit	fell,	so	I	knew	it	was	my fault.	Pa	had	addressed	his	query	to	everyone,	not	to	me	specifically, which	was	proof	of	my	failure:	If	I	had	really	been	responsible,	I	would</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>have	been	expected	to	answer,	even	if	only	to	admit	my	guilt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	reached	for	Little	Bit.	Mayella	said,	"Don't	move	her,	ma'm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Ma	answered,	"I	know,"	Little	Bit's	eyes	opened.	She	whispered,	"Di' </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	faw?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	laughed.	"Yes,	little	darling,	you	did."	When	Little	Bit	didn't respond,	Pa	said,	"Little	Bit?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm?"	Little	Bit	looked	toward	the	highway	where	cars	sped	past	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Letitia?	Are	you	all	right?"	Little	Bit	looked	toward	Ma.	Her eyes	did	not	focus.	Ma	said,	"Oh,	God." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Easy,	Susan.	Little	Bit?	Can	you	understand	me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"Umm.	Hmm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	said,	"She	took	a	bad	fall,	Mist'	Luke.	You	got	to	give	her	time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"I'm	taking	her	to	see	Doctor	Lamont." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Maybe	we	should	watch	her	for	awhile." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Luke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"We've	got	one	doctor	bill	to	pay	already." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	repeated,	"I'm	taking	her	to	see	Doctor	Lamont." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"I'll	drive." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	sat	between	Ma	and	Pa.	Digger	and	I	had	the	back	to ourselves,	so	we	rolled	our	toy	cars	back	and	forth	across	the	vinyl seat	and	tried	to	be	quiet.	Dr.	Lamont	said	Little	Bit	didn't	have	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>fracture,	but	we	should	watch	her,	in	case	she	acted	strangely.	Pa	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	sure,	but	what	if	she	acts	differently?"	Dr.	Lamont	laughed, though	Ma	didn't.	Driving	back,	we	passed	Artie	Drake	on	the	street,	and he	waved	at	Ma.	Ma	smiled	and	nodded	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	stopped	at	Gideon's	19-cent	Hamburgers	on	the	way	home.	As	we	walked in,	Mr.	Shale	said,	"My	hounds	are	bred	out	of	the	Spartan	kind,	so flewed,	so	sanded;	and	their	heads	are	hung	with	ears	that	sweep	away the	morning	dew;	crook-kneed,	and	dew-lapped	like	the	Thessalian	bulls; slow	in	pursuit,	but	matched	in	mouth	like	bells." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Excuse	me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Shale	said,	"A	Midsummer	Night's	Dream.	How	are	you,	Miss	Letitia?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"We	were	at	the	doctor's.	She	fell." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Would	a	starberry	milk	shake	help?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	smiled	and	nodded.	Ma	and	Pa	both	grinned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good	to	hear,"	said	Mr.	Shale,	reaching	for	an	ice	cream	scoop.	"Jesus told	me	to	get	that	freezer	fixed,	and	your	smile's	all	the	reward	I could	want." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Choc'late,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Shale	nodded.	"That's	a	nice	reward,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	week	later,	Little	Bit	began	stuttering	whenever	she	spoke,	calling	us K-k-k-Chris,	D-d-d-Digger,	P-p-p-papa,	and	Mmmm-mama.	She	stuttered	for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>a	week,	then	quit	as	abruptly	as	she	had	begun. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a>Dogs	came	to	Dogland	more	quickly	than	kennels	could	be	built	for	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	always	had	several	living	in	and	around	our	house	while	their	homes were	being	prepared.	Before	we	could	become	familiar	with	one,	it	would be	in	its	kennel	and	a	new	dog	would	take	its	place	on	our	porch,	in	our house,	and	in	our	hearts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Each	kennel	was	designed	for	five	dogs.	Ethorne's	crew	made	the	houses, long,	wooden	structures	with	five	separate	rooms,	each	with	its	own porch.	The	houses	came	in	three	sizes.	The	small	rooms	were	just	big enough	to	hold	Little	Bit	and	a	Lhasa	Apso;	the	big	rooms	could	have been	club	houses	for	all	three	Nix	kids. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handyman	and	Pa	supervised	the	pouring	of	the	concrete	runways,	which sloped	into	a	common	gutter.	Ethorne's	crew	put	up	chainlink	fence	to separate	the	dogs.	Ma	made	hand-lettered	wooden	signs	that	hung	on	hooks on	the	dogs'	front	gates,	identifying	each	by	breed,	name,	and	owner.	Pa built	twenty-four	kennels,	and	though	they	were	never	all	full,	we	had more	than	a	hundred	pure-bred	dogs	on	our	grounds	within	our	first	year of	operation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	kennels	were	arranged	in	a	circle	at	the	back	of	Dogland.	You reached	it	by	going	through	the	Doggy	Salon,	a	pavillion	built	to	house the	tiniest	dogs	and	to	provide	a	place	to	groom	and	nurse	all	the	dogs. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a>Mickey	the	Chihuahua	ruled	the	Doggy	Salon,	barking	at	all	who	entered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	Dogland's	peak,	Mickey	shared	the	Salon	with	a	Mexican	Hairless	that shivered	no	matter	how	hot	the	day	might	be,	and	a	Toy	Manchester terrier	that	loved	to	lick	fingers,	and	several	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	only	pure-bred	dog	that	often	had	free	run	of	Dogland	was	Ranger,	a huge,	shaggy,	white	kuvasz	whose	mouth	always	hung	slightly	open	in	a lazy,	wolflike	grin.	kuvaszes	had	guarded	Hungarian	kings	in	the fifteenth	century;	Pa	decided	Ranger	was	good	enough	to	guard	our family,	too.	During	the	day,	Ranger	stayed	in	his	cage	next	to	the	other large	working	dogs,	the	Great	Dane,	the	St.	Bernard,	the	mastiff,	and the	Newfoundland.	During	the	night,	Pa	let	Ranger	out	to	patrol	Dogland. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	remember	Ranger	as	taller	than	me,	but	I	don't	remember	being	afraid of	him.	Pa	bought	a	steel	cart	with	bicycle	wheels	and	a	wooden	bench wide	enough	that	we	three	kids	could	sit	side	by	side	on	it.	Ranger pulled	us	easily	whenever	newspaper	people	wanted	to	shoot	publicity photos.	(Pa	intended	to	offer	dog	cart	rides	to	tourists'	children,	but if	the	experiment	was	ever	tried,	I	don't	remember	it.) One	night	when	Pa	was	away	and	we	kids	were	asleep,	Ma	heard	Ranger barking.	She	took	a	flashlight	to	investigate,	and	found	a	drunken	man cringing	against	the	Heart	Tree	with	Ranger	before	him.	The	man	said,	"O</p>
<p class="calibre1">great	white	spirit,	don'	eat	me,	please!"	Ma	laughed	and	held	Ranger's</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a>collar	while	the	drunken	man	ran	away.	When	Ma	told	the	story,	we laughed,	too.	Who	could	be	afraid	of	Ranger?	He	was	our	friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dogs	arrived	at	Dogland	in	many	ways.	Some	were	brought	by	their	owners, who	wished	to	assure	themselves	that	the	dogs	would	be	properly	fed, housed,	and	exercised.	Some	were	shipped	to	the	Gainesville	train station	or	the	Dickison	bus	stop.	Our	Doberman	pinscher,	a	lean, seventy-pound	black-and-rust	beast	named	Percival,	arrived	late	one	day in	a	cage.	Percival	barked	when	anyone	came	near.	He	was	hungry, thirsty,	tired,	confused,	frustrated,	and	furious.	He	had	been	traveling for	at	least	three	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	said,	"That	dog	don't	like	niggers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"That	dog	doesn't	like	anyone.	He's	a	liberal." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	said,	"I'm	mighty	fond	of	my	fingers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Got	to	give	him	time	to	quiet	down.	And	got	to	show	him we	don't	mean	to	keep	him	in	that	cage.	We	might	let	him	out	in	the ex'cise	pen."	He	looked	at	Pa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	The	men	had	recently	finished	fencing	a	large,	sandy	area near	the	kennels	where	dogs	could	run	and	dig	and	play.	Pa	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Everyone	take	a	corner." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	four	men	lifted	the	cage	by	its	handles.	Ethorne	told	Percival, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Easy,	boy.	You	be	gettin'	somethin'	closer	to	freedom	real	soon	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a>The	Doberman	circled	in	the	wire	cage,	barking	at	its	transporters'	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	said,	"Keep	something	deprived	long	enough,	it's	bound	to	snap	out at	anything." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shoot,"	said	James.	"That's	just	one	mean-spirited	dog,	is	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Some	things	always	lookin'	for	an	excuse	to	bite,"	said	Ethorne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Doesn't	mean	you	should	give	'em	one,"	said	Pa.	"Damn	Dobermans	tend	to be	a	bit	in-bred.	Once	this	one	gets	to	know	us,	he'll	be	all	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	we	approached	the	exercise	pen,	Pa	said,	"Chris,	open	the	gate." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Yes,	sir!"	and	ran	ahead	through	the	long	grass	to	fumble	with the	latch.	It	lifted	just	as	the	men	arrived,	and	I	sighed	and	grinned simultaneously.	Ethorne	grinned	back.	Pa	didn't	say	or	do	anything, which	meant	I'd	done	fine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ain't	goin'	to	fit,"	said	James,	looking	from	the	cage	to	the	gate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	sure?"	said	Seth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	got	eyes,	don't	I?"	said	James. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's	try,"	said	Seth.	"Never	know	if	you	don't	try." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"Might	squeeze	through,	if	we're	lucky." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	grinned.	"I	say	that,	too,	now'n	then." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	not	lucky.	After	one	attempt	to	carry	the	cage	into	the exercise	area,	Seth	said,	"Why'd	they	put	a	dog	in	such	a	big	box,	anyway?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	said,	"'Cause	that's	all	they	had,	most	like." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a>Ethorne	said,	"'Cause	someone	had	a	feelin'	for	this	dog.	When	you	got to	cage	something	you	like,	you	give	it	the	biggest	cage	you	got." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"All	right.	We'll	put	the	cage	up	to	the	door	of	the	pen.	When the	dog	goes	in	the	pen,	Seth,	you	close	that	gate.	Fast." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Ethorne,	you	and	James	pull	the	cage	back	out	of	the	way	as soon	as	that	dog's	out	of	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	and	James	both	said,	"Yes,	sir."	They	placed	the	cage	against the	open	door.	Pa	looked	at	the	others,	then	at	Little	Bit	and	me	where we	stood	watching	from	twenty	feet	away.	Then	he	reached	over	the	top	of Percival's	cage,	unlatched	the	front	grille,	and	lifted	it	high. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	might	have	all	gone	as	planned,	if	Ma	had	known	the	Doberman	had arrived.	But	Ma	had	gone	out	to	the	kennels	to	check	on	the	dogs,	and since	the	day	was	ending,	she	had	let	Ranger	out.	We	heard	her	call</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ranger!"	from	the	far	side	of	the	circle	of	dog	pens,	and	we	all	looked up.	Ranger	raced	through	the	island	of	palmettoes	and	live	oaks, approaching	like	a	great	ghostly	god	of	wolves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Damn!"	Pa	slammed	the	grille	down	a	moment	too	late.	It	clipped Percival's	shoulder	as	he	bounded	out	of	his	cage.	"Close	that--"	Pa began,	but	Percival	wheeled	in	the	gateway.	As	Seth	shoved	the	gate forward,	and	Ethorne	and	James	yanked	the	cage	backward,	Percival</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a>leaped,	bounding	over	his	cage	and	charging	toward	Little	Bit	and	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Get	back!"	Pa	yelled	at	us	as	he	followed	the	Doberman.	I	stared	at dark	eyes	and	glistening	teeth,	then	twisted	aside,	bumped	into	Little Bit,	caught	her	arm,	and	began	to	run,	dragging	her	behind	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't!"	Little	Bit	shook	her	arm	free	and	pointed.	"Nice	dog!	See?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Doberman.	ignoring	us,	raced	along	the	exercise	pen,	heading	toward the	highway.	Ranger	intercepted	him	before	he	reached	the	end	of	the fence.	The	kuvasz	must	have	been	twenty	pounds	heavier	than	the Doberman,	yet	Percival	did	not	hesitate.	He	lunged	for	Ranger's	throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ranger	met	the	attack,	twisting	aside	and	snapping	his	teeth	close	to Percival's	snout. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	yelled,	"Ranger!	Down,	boy!"	as	Pa	stepped	between	the	dogs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ranger	backed	away,	and,	when	Pa	grabbed	for	the	Doberman's	collar, Percival	sunk	his	teeth	deep	into	Pa's	right	forearm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	hit	the	Doberman	once	in	the	nose	with	his	left	fist.	Percival	did not	let	go.	Ethorne,	James,	and	Seth	reached	to	pull	Percival	away,	and Ranger	circled	around	them.	Pa	grunted,	"Hold	Ranger!"	and	slammed	the Doberman	onto	his	back	on	the	ground.	His	bleeding	arm	slipped	free	of the	dog's	bite.	His	right	hand	covered	Percival's	throat	and	jaw, extending	the	Doberman's	head	back	so	it	was	parallel	with	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	left	hand	held	the	dog's	stomach,	pinning	Percival's	torso.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a>dog's	limbs	thrashed	as	he	tried	to	claw	or	flee,	and	he	whimpered desperately.	With	his	head	only	inches	away	from	Percival's,	Pa	yelled, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who's	boss,	damn	it!	Who's	boss?"	With	each	yell,	Pa	pressed	Percival against	the	ground,	then	released	him	slightly	in	order	to	press	him down	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Percival	lay	still.	His	whimpering	slowed	and	quieted	to	a	desperately hopeful	plea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said	with	disgust	and	disappointment,	"All	right,	then."	He	looked	at Ethorne.	"Put	him	in	the	pen." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said	quietly,	"Yes,	sir,	Mist'	Luke."	He	clipped	a	leash	to Percival's	collar	and	said,	"C'mon,	boy."	Percival	began	to	growl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne,	keeping	the	leash	taut,	held	out	his	free	hand,	palm	forward for	the	dog	to	sniff.	"Di'n't	you	learn	nothin',	boy?"	Percival	let Ethorne	lead	him	into	the	exercise	pen.	Ethorne	seemed	to	be	watching	Pa more	than	the	Doberman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	smiled.	"Reckon	he	knows	who's	boss	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth,	holding	Ranger's	collar,	looked	at	Pa's	arm	and	said,	"Mist'	Nix, I'm	sorry,	I	tried	to	close	him	in,	honest,	I	did."	His	accent	was	as thick	as	James'.	It	was	easy	to	believe	he	was	Ethorne's	son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	clenched	his	bleeding	arm	with	his	left	hand	and	shook	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every	kennel	had	a	faucet	and	a	hose	on	its	side	for	washing	the	dogs</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a>and	their	runs.	Pa	went	to	the	nearest	and	rinsed	his	arm,	but	the	flow of	blood	did	not	slow.	The	Doberman's	bite	had	opened	his	flesh	in	a long,	deep	tear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	bad,"	said	Little	Bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Umm,"	said	Pa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	nodded.	"Best	have	Mis'	DeLyon	look	at	that,	Mist'	Luke.	Might be	the	doc	should	see	it,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	need	a	doctor."	Pa	never	needed	doctors.	He	began	to	walk	toward our	house.	"Susan'll	tie	it	up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	come	along,"	Ethorne	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shook	his	head.	"Chris	or	Little	Bit	can	tell	you	where	my	body	is, if	I	fall	on	the	way.	C'mon,	kids." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	frowned.	"If	you	say	so." </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	had	hardly	gone	twenty	yards	when	Ma	and	Digger	came	around	the	path along	the	kennels.	Ma	said,	"Have	you	seen	Ranger?	I	let--	Oh,	my	God." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stared	at	Pa's	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	stared,	too,	then	began	to	cry.	Little	Bit	took	his	hand	and said,	"Don't	cry	now,	Digger,"	and	he	stopped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Now,	Susan,	don't	get	excited.	Just	run	ahead	to	the	house	to get	some	bandages.	It's	a	dog	bite,	that's	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	all?"	Ma	said.	"You--" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a>"You	prefer	I	bleed	to	death	here?"	As	Ma	shook	her	head,	Pa	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Little	Bit,	you	and	Digger	follow	your	Ma.	I'll	keep	Chris	to	lean	on, if	I	need	to." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	my	God,"	Ma	repeated.	"C'mon,	kids."	She	ran	toward	the	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	and	I	picked	our	way	over	open	ground	where	plumbing	had	been recently	buried	and	where	walking	paths	had	yet	to	be	finished.	Pa's skin	was	damp	and	pale,	and	his	blood	marked	our	trail	from	the	kennels to	the	house.	In	one	kind	of	fairytale,	wolves	would	follow	the	smell	of the	blood,	and	in	another,	we	would	make	our	way	to	the	princess	whose kiss	could	heal,	and	in	a	third,	Pa's	blood	would	turn	into	red	birds whose	song	would	bring	joy	to	the	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What'll	you	do	to	the	bad	dog,	Pa?"	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothing?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	was	my	fault." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	blinked	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Should've	made	sure	Ranger	was	penned	before	letting	the	Doberman	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Should've	hosed	'em	both	down	instead	of	grabbing	at	'em.	That's	what you	get	when	you	don't	think." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	didn't	think,	Pa?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	laughed	weakly.	"No	need	to	rub	it	in." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a>I	stared	at	his	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your	Pa	makes	mistakes,	you	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stared	up	at	him.	Things	were	often	my	fault,	or	Ma's,	or	sometimes even	Little	Bit's.	If	Pa	was	saying	he	could	be	wrong,	that	must	be	so, because	Pa	was	always	right.	Had	I	been	two	or	three	years	older,	that would	have	been	a	paradox.	At	four,	it	was	simply	a	new	truth.	To	be sure	I	understood,	I	said,	"You	do?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded	as	we	entered	the	house.	He	leaned	against	the	door	frame, then	lurched	inside.	Blood	spattered	onto	the	dark	floor	tiles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	hurried	out	of	the	bathroom	with	the	blue	metal	first	aid	box. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Opening	it,	she	said,	"What	happened?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shook	his	head.	"Ranger	and	the	Doberman	wanted	to	fight.	I	got	in the	way." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	whispered,	"Oh.	I	didn't--"	As	she	wiped	his	arm	clean,	Pa	grimaced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"You	have	to	see	the	doctor,	Luke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shook	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"You	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I	don't	have	to	see	any	damn	doctor.	Especially	not	that	bigot." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"If	the	dog's	rabid?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"More	likely,	I'm	rabid.	You	better	worry	about	that	poor Doberman."	He	laughed,	but	his	shirt	was	drenched	in	sweat,	and	his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a>chest	rose	and	fell	as	he	gasped	for	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	the	time	Ma	finished	taping	gauze	around	Pa's	forearm,	the	bandage was	already	soaked	with	blood.	Ma	said,	"You	need	stitches." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"The	hell	I	do,"	and	fainted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	caught	him	as	he	collapsed.	She	screamed	at	me,	"Get	Ethorne!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	ran	outside,	yelling,	"Ethorne!	Ethorne!"	Ethorne	loped	across	the field	toward	me,	and	I	yelled,	"Ma	wants	you!	Ma	wants	you!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Pa	came	to	a	minute	later,	Ma	and	Ethorne	were	carrying	him	to	the station	wagon.	"I	can	walk,"	he	said,	wrenching	himself	free	of	their grip,	and	he	staggered	to	the	car.	He	hesitated,	resting	bloody	hands	on the	hood,	then	went	to	the	passenger	door,	telling	Ma,	"You	drive." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	car	I	began	to	wonder	whether	Pa	could	die. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	Dr.	Lamont	and	Pa	came	out	of	the	doctor's	office,	Dr.	Lamont said,	"You	folks're	going	to	pay	for	the	fishing	boat	I	been	looking	at, if	you	keep	this	up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Yeah,	funny." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Lamont	said,	"I'll	test	that	dog	that	bit	you.	If	it's	got	rabies, you'll	be	going	through	a	pretty	painful	process,	Luke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Mmm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	going	to	put	that	dog	down?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	at	him.	"Why?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a>Dr.	Lamont	said,	"It's	got	a	taste	for	human	blood." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	laughed.	"You	know	how	much	that	dog's	worth?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"It's	not	worth	taking	the	chance	that	anyone'll	be	hurt."	She looked	at	Little	Bit	and	me,	so	I	smiled	at	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	scowled.	"It	was	my	own	damn	fault.	I'm	getting	tired	of	having	to say	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Lamont	said,	"That	land's	taking	a	lot	from	y'all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"What's	that	supposed	to	mean?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Lamont	smiled.	"Means	I'll	be	getting	my	fishing	boat	if	this	keeps	up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	put	money	on	it,"	Pa	said,	and	walked	out	of	the	waiting	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	smiled	at	Dr.	Lamont.	"Well,	thanks,	Dr.	Lamont.	Luke's--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Lamont	nodded.	"It's	hard	to	keep	your	spirits	up	when	your	arm's hurting.	'Specially	if	you're	the	sort	who	doesn't	like	the	sight	of	blood." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"You	like	seeing	blood,	Dr.	Lamont?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	said,	"Beg	pardon?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Letitia!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Lamont	said,	"Don't	you	never	mind.	I	couldn't	quite	make	out	what she	said." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	front	yard,	the	station	wagon	started	with	a	roar.	Ma	glanced over	her	shoulder	and	said,	"We	have	to	run." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Lamont	nodded.	"Hope	the	next	time	I	see	you	is	under	better</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a>circumstances." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	nodded	and	hurried	us	out.	Pa	drove	us	back,	and	no	one	spoke.	Not one	of	us	kids	asked	to	watch	when	he	changed	the	bandages.	After	a	week or	two,	Pa	cut	the	stitches	and	pulled	them	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>In	the	motel	unit	that	was	our	home,	there	was	a	sink	in	each	of	the	two bedrooms.	Ma	kept	a	chair	next	to	each	sink	for	us	kids	to	stand	or kneel	on	when	we	needed	to	wash.	One	morning	in	our	parent's	room	while Ma	was	helping	Little	Bit	and	me	with	our	shoes,	Digger	fell	from	the chair.	Mickey's	food	bowl	was	on	the	floor	beneath	the	sink.	Digger	hit the	bowl	with	his	forehead,	strewing	blood,	broken	porcelain,	and	moist dog	food	all	around	him.	When	we	looked,	he	lay	motionless	on	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mickey	yapped	desperately	and	bounded	around	Digger's	arms.	Digger pushed	himself	up.	The	skin	of	his	forehead	had	been	opened	from	his hairline	to	his	eye.	When	he	saw	Ma	running	toward	him,	he	began	to	wail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again	we	made	the	drive	to	Dickison.	While	Dr.	Lamont	put	eight	stitches in	Digger's	forehead,	I	pondered	the	pictures	in	the	comic	books	in	the waiting	room,	Little	Bit	rolled	wooden	blocks	across	the	carpet,	and	Pa leafed	through	copies	of	Life	and	Look.	When	Dr.	Lamont	and	Ma	came	back with	Digger,	Dr.	Lamont	said,	"I	can't	promise	there	won't	be	some deformity.	I'm	sorry." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	squeezed	Digger	tighter.	Pa	said,	"He	can	see	all	right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Doesn't	seem	to	have	affected	his	vision.	Time	will	tell." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"Can	Digger	go	swimmin'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a>Ma	said,	"May	Digger	go	swimming?"	Then	she	told	Dr.	Lamont,	"We	have	a little	wading	pool.	And	Mrs.	DeLyon	lets	the	children	play	in	her swimming	pool,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Lamont	narrowed	his	eyes,	then	nodded.	"So	long	as	the	boy's	in clean	water,	he	should	be	fine." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Driving	home	in	the	station	wagon,	Ma	looked	out	the	window.	I	didn't see	anything	except	trees	and	billboards	there.	She	said	quietly,	"I wasn't	watching.	I	was	dressing	Letitia,	and	I	turned	away.	He'd	never had	any	trouble	washing	himself.	Never.	And	I	didn't	think--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shrugged,	keeping	his	gaze	on	the	road.	"Can't	watch	kids	all	the time,	Susan.	They're	going	to	get	hurt.	That's	just	how	it	is." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger,	in	the	front	seat	between	them,	began	to	whimper.	Ma	hugged	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Here,"	and	handed	Ma	Digger's	toy	crane.	He	laughed	when	he	saw	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"That	was	very	thoughtful,	Chris." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	my	boots	and	blushed.	The	toy	had	been	lying	by	my	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyone	would	have	passed	it	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	morning,	Digger,	giggling,	ran	naked	from	the	bathroom	into	our parents'	room.	Pa	winced	and	said,	"Jesus,	Susan,	cover	up	his	forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kid	looks	like	Frankenstein's	Baby." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	stopped	in	the	middle	of	the	room	and	squinted	at	Pa,	then	at	Ma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	frowned,	scooped	Digger	up,	took	him	to	the	chair	he	had	fallen	from, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a>and	began	wrapping	a	gauze	bandage	around	his	forehead.	I	said,	"It's not	fair." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"What's	not?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why's	Digger	get	to	look	like	a	pirate?	I	want	to	be	a	pirate,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Okay.	I'll	do	you	next." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"Me,	too!	Me,	too!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	went	to	the	door	and,	as	he	left,	said,	"You	can	dress	the	walking wounded.	Ethorne	and	I	need	to	run	into	town	for	more	dog	food." </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	Ma	bandaged	Little	Bit,	I	ran	outside	to	slice	the	air	with	an imaginary	cutlass.	Seth,	James,	and	Mayella	were	sitting	on	the	sidewalk around	the	kitchen,	waiting	for	the	workday	to	begin.	Seth	pointed	at me.	"Look-a-there.	It's	the	mummy	of	King	Tot." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	laughed.	James	said,	"King	what?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	shrugged.	"Forget	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	said,	"No,	what?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	said,	"It	was	a	joke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	looked	at	Mayella.	"Must'a'	been	a	funny	one." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	looked	at	Seth.	"Took	me	by	surprise,	is	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	said,	"You	know	about	Egyptian	mummies,	don't	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	said,	"Sure,"	as	I	said,	"No,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	three	of	them	looked	at	me,	then	they	all	grinned.	Mayella	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a>"Sir!	Who	he	talkin'	to,	I	wonder?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	said,	"That's	one	smart	kid,	that	is." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah?"	said	James.	"He	don'	know	'bout	the	'Gyptians." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	you	better	teach	him,"	said	Seth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Me?"	James	touched	his	chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Since	you	know	all	about	them,"	said	Seth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah,"	said	Mayella.	"We	listenin'." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,"	said	James,	looking	around,	then	settling	his	gaze	on	me.	"The</p>
<p class="calibre1">'Gyptians	was	the	world's	first	civilization.	And	you	know	where	Egypt	is?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Africa.	The	Egyptians	was	Africans.	Most	o'	their	queens	looked	a	sight more	like	Mayella	than	'Lizabeth	Taylor."	He	looked	at	Mayella	and flashed	his	teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	smiled	as	she	looked	away.	"No." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	frowned	and	said,	"Cleopatra	was	descended	from	the	Macedonians	who conquered	Egypt,	so	she	prob'ly	did	look	a	bit	like	Liz	Taylor." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	said,	"Did	I	or	did	I	not	say	'most'	o'	their	queens?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	nodded	reluctantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	laughed.	"There	you	is,	collegeboy."	He	looked	back	at	me.	"The</p>
<p class="calibre1">'Gyptians,	they	was	fixed	on	eternal	life.	That	was	why	they	wrapped	up their	kings	an'	queens	an'	made	'em	mummies.	They	thought	there	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a>tie	'tween	the	survival	of	their	bodies	an'	the	salvation	of	their souls.	They	thought	their	souls	would	travel	a	long	ways,	crossin'	a	lot o'	bodies	o'	water	to	reach	the	land	o'	the	dead.	An'	you	know	who escorted	their	souls	to	the	land	o'	the	dead?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Anubis,"	said	James.	"He	was	a	'Gyptian	god.	An'	you	know	what	his	head looked	like?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	jackal.	That's	a	wild	dog.	You	know	that	Pharaoh	Hound	what	come	in the	other	day?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	Pa	had	been	very	proud	of	getting	the	Pharaoh	Hound.	It	was	a sleek	tan	Egyptian	racing	dog	that	might	be	the	oldest	breed	of domesticated	dog. </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	smiled.	"Ol'	Anubis	had	a	body	of	a	man	an'	a	head	of	a	dog.	He was	the	god	o'	cemetaries	and	embalming.	'Gyptians	didn't	know	a	thing about	Jesus." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	said,	"Who	you	been	talkin'	to?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	grinned.	"Ethorne." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	laughed.	"He	told	you	he	was	in	ancient	Egypt,	I	expect." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	shook	his	head.	"Said	he	read	a	lot	of	books." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p163"></a>"Said	he	met	someone	who	was	there,	though." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	and	Mayella	both	laughed.	Mayella	said,	"That's	Ethorne.	He	tells some	tall	ones." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	frowned.	"He	ever	lie	to	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	shook	her	head.	Seth	said,	"Not	about	anything	important." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	said,	"Like	what?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	said,	"Like	his	story	that	he	was	a	slave	here.	Come	on." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	said,	"You	think	he	wasn't?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	know	he	wasn't." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	can	prove	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	stared	at	him.	"What	kind	of	nappy-headed	nigger	do	you	take	me for?	Nobody	needs	to	prove	something	that's	impossible	is	impossible." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ethorne	knows	how	the	pyramids	were	built." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	laughed.	"So	do	I.	Like	the	ol'	South	was	built.	With	slaves." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	shook	his	head.	"Hired	folks,	mostly,	says	Ethorne.	Workin'	durin' </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	winter	when	the	crops	was	in.	An'	that's	not	the	question.	How'd they	lift	those	big	stone	blocks	to	build	the	pyramids?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	said,	"Wooden	cranes,	maybe.	Swing	'em	up	there?	I	dunno." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	nodded	in	victory.	"They	made	ramps	of	sand	and	hauled	those blocks	up	on	rollers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	shrugged.	"Sounds	reasonable." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p164"></a>"There	you	are,"	said	James. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ethorne	must've	read	that.	Or	maybe	he	made	it	up.	Doesn't	prove	a thing	about	his	stories,	you	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	nodded.	"Not	to	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	jerked	his	thumb	at	James	and	addressed	Mayella.	"Can	you	b'lieve--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	stopped	speaking,	we	all	looked	to	see	why.	A	young	white	woman had	come	around	the	corner.	She	appeared	to	be	about	as	old	as	Artie Drake's	daughter,	which	meant	she	was	younger	than	Mayella,	James,	or Seth.	She	had	thin	blond	hair	cut	like	a	football	helmet,	and	she	wore	a cotton	dress	that	looked	thinner	and	more	faded	than	Mayella's.	I	looked to	see	if	she	had	come	with	her	parents	and	saw	she	was	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	studied	us,	and	we	studied	her.	Then	Mayella	stood,	saying,	"Help you,	miss?"	James	followed	Mayella's	example.	He	nudged	Seth	with	his foot,	and	Seth	scrambled	to	his	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	white	girl	said,	"This	here's	the	dog	place?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	could	hear	dogs	barking	in	the	distance,	but	I	said	nothing.	Mayella said,	"Yes'm.	Ain't	open	for	business	yet." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	lookin'	for	the	owner." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	my	Pa,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	at	me	without	smiling.	"Where	can	I	find	him?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	went	to	town	with	Ethorne,"	I	said.	"My	Ma's	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p165"></a>The	girl	nodded.	"What's	wrong	with	your	head?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	a	pirate." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh."	She	looked	at	Mayella	and	smiled.	"That'd	'xplain	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ma's	at	the	house."	I	pointed	at	the	motel	unit.	"She's	going	to	make bre'fast.	Pa	makes	scrambled	eggs,	but	Ma	makes	French	toast." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girl	nodded,	looked	at	the	four	of	us,	then	nodded	again	and	started toward	the	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	whispered,	"Kind	o'	cute,	for	a	Cracker." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	elbowed	him	in	the	arm.	"You	gone	color-blind,	stupid,	or	both?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	whispered,	"Nigger,	Emmett	Till	died	for	whistling	at	a	white	woman." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	said,	"In	Mississippi." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	said,	"They	hang	fools	in	Florida,	too."	She	looked	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	followed	her	glance.	"Say,	Christopher,	d'you	think	that's	a	pretty young	lady?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	and	scuffed	gravel	with	the	toe	of	my	boot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	grinned.	"Well,	I	agree	with	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	whispered,	"Shee-it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	screen	door	opened	as	the	white	girl	approached	our	house,	and	Ma led	Digger	and	Little	Bit	out.	The	blond	girl	stopped	still. </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	said,	"That's	a	mess	of	pirates." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	at	the	girl's	face,	then	smiled,	indicating	Digger	with	a	dip</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a>of	her	chin.	"George	cut	his	forehead.	The	other	two	are	pretending	it's Halloween." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,"	said	the	girl.	"Ma'm,	I'm	Francine	Carter,	an'	I'm	lookin'	for	work." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	let	go	of	Digger	and	held	out	her	right	hand.	"Susan	Nix.	You'll have	to	talk	to	my	husband	about	work.	Right	now,	we're	just	getting things	ready.	When	the	restaurant	opens,	we'll	need	waitresses.	And	when the	grounds	are	ready,	we'll	need	guides	to	take	the	tourists	around." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There's	nothin'	now,	ma'm?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Mostly,	there's	just	heavy	labor--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	strong,	ma'm,"	Francine	said.	"I	was	born	a	McKay.	McKays	is country	people,	an'	we	work	hard.	I	can	hoe	an'	haul	an'	cut	weeds	an' </p>
<p class="calibre1">put	up	fence	an'	most	anything.	You	try	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	sure	you	can,"	Ma	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	work	with	niggers,"	Francine	said.	"I	don't	mind.	I'll	work	for nigger	wages,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"We	try	to	pay	a	fair	wage	to	everyone.	That	isn't--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ma'm,	I	don't	mean	to	beg,	but	I	want	you	to	know	I'm	willin'	to	do most	any	kind	of	work,	honest." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	nodded.	"I'm	sure	of	that.	There	might	be	some	kind	of	part-time	work you	can	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	huntin'	full-time	work,	ma'm.	But	I'll	take	part-time	if	that's	all</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a>there	is." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	frowned.	"You'd	skip	school?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ma'm,	I	done	finished	ninth	grade.	Now	I	need	to	support	my	family." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	see,"	Ma	said.	"How	old	are	you,	Francine?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sixteen,	ma'm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	your	father	made	you	quit	school	to	get	a	job?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	ma'm.	But	Pa	says	since	I	got	married,	it's	my	husband's	job	to support	me,	only	Cal	ain't	found	no	steady	work,	quite	yet.	He	ain't about	to	do	nigger	work,	but	I	don't	mind." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	glanced	at	Little	Bit	and	Digger.	Little	Bit	said,	"Digger's	hungry,	Ma." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	at	Francine.	"You	said	your	family.	Do	you	have	a	child?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francine	nodded.	"Little	Cal,	yes'm.	My	sister	don'	mind	lookin'	after him,	since	she's	got	plenty	of	her	own.	He's	a	good	baby.	He	won't	cause me	to	miss	no	work	or	nothin'." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	up	at	the	parking	area,	but	the	station	wagon	was	still	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	asked,	"Have	you	eaten	this	morning?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francine	said,	"No'm.	I'm	not	hungry,	ma'm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	nodded.	"Come	up	to	the	restaurant.	You	might	as	well	join	us	while we	wait	for	Luke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	ain't	askin'	for	handouts,	ma'm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	know.	I	have	to	make	breakfast,	and	Luke	gets	upset	when	there	are</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a>leftovers.	So,	if	there's	any	extra,	you'd	be	doing	me	a	favor." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	frowned	and	said,	"There's	always	leftovers,	Ma." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	laughed.	"See?	Come	on." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	all	right,"	said	Francine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	looked	up	at	her.	"My	name's	Let'bet.	D'you	have	a	dog?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francine	nodded.	"We	got	a	few.	Best	one's	a	coon	dog." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	many	we	got,	Chris?"	Little	Bit	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	held	up	both	hands	and	opened	and	closed	my	fingers,	over	and	over	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francine	nodded	again.	"That's	a	lot	o'	dogs." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They're	mostly	loaned	to	us,"	Ma	said.	"Don't	brag,	you	two." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella,	James,	and	Seth	all	said	good	morning	as	we	approached.	Ma smiled	at	them	and	began	unlocking	the	kitchen	door,	saying,	"This	is Francine.	She'll	be	working	here,	for	a	few	days,	anyway.	Seth	and James,	since	Luke's	not	back	yet,	you're	welcome	to	come	in	for	some coffee." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	said,	"Thank	you,	ma'm.	That'd	be	nice." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	and	James	stared	at	him.	Then	James	dipped	his	head,	saying, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank	you,	Mis'	Nix.	I'd	'preciate	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	kitchen,	we	three	kids	went	immediately	to	our	usual	seats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	followed	Ma	over	by	the	sink,	where	she	said,	"What'd	you	like me	to	do,	ma'm?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p169"></a>Ma	said,	"Start	lots	of	coffee.	James?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He,	Seth,	and	Francine	were	standing	by	the	door.	"Yes'm?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You'll	find	some	chairs	in	the	front	room." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes'm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	help,"	said	Seth,	following	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	many	you	want?"	said	Francine,	starting	after	Seth	and	James. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	caught	her	arm.	"Let	the	men	do	it.	You	sit." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	nodded	and	hit	the	chair	beside	her	with	the	flat	of	her hand.	"Sit	here!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francine	nodded	and	took	the	chair.	"All	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Who's	eaten?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Not	me!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"Not	me!	Not	Digger!"	Digger	nodded	several	times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Besides	you	three?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francine	said,	"I	ain't	hungry,	ma'm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	done	ate,"	said	Mayella. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	watched	James	eat,"	said	Seth.	"That	took	care	of	my	appetite." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	dog!"	said	James.	"You	put	away	as	much	as	I	did." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What'd	you	have?"	asked	Ma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ethorne	made	grits	an'	eggs	an'	biscuits,"	said	Mayella.	"He's	the	best cook	in	these	parts.	For	a	colored	man,	that	is,	ma'm.	He	scrambled	up</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p170"></a>the	eggs	with	onion	an'	thyme	an'	rosemary.	His	biscuits	is	like	clouds in	a	crust.	Folks	say	Ethorne	talks	to	the	food	an'	it	tells	him	how	to fix	it	best." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My	mama	makes	better	grits,"	said	James. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	said,	"It's	good	to	see	a	boy	stick	up	for	his	mama." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	faked	a	punch	at	Seth,	and	Seth	blocked	it.	Everyone	laughed, including	Francine,	though	her	face	quickly	slid	back	to	its	usual somber	expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	ain't	much	call	for	grits	in	no'the'n	hotels,"	said	Mayella. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,"	said	Ma,	"my	kids	will	just	have	to	make	do	with	French	toast." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yum,	good!"	I	yelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Pa	arrived,	Francine	was	eating	her	second	stack	of	French	toast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	and	James	stood	up	from	the	table,	both	saying	something	like, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thanks	for	the	coffee,	Mis'	Nix,	that	was	sure	nice,	we'll	go	find Ethorne	and	get	right	to	work	now,	Mist'	Nix,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	Pa	was	going	to	be	furious	about	how	Ma	had	cooked	way	too much	more	food,	but	Ma	said,	"We	have	to	talk,"	and	he	and	Ma	went	into the	front	room.	When	they	came	back,	Pa	never	said	a	word	about	the waste.	He	just	told	Francine	to	catch	up	to	Ethorne,	so	she	could	start learning	about	the	care	of	the	dogs,	and	we'd	see	how	things	went. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	almost	everyone	had	left	the	kitchen,	Mayella,	washing	dishes, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p171"></a>told	Ma,	"That	poor	girl.	Some	folks	has	it	rough." </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	night	in	my	parents'	bedroom,	watching	TV,	Ma	said	something similar:	"Poor	Francine.	Did	you	know	she	walked	three	miles	to	get here?	And	she	plans	to	walk	that	every	day." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded	without	looking	up	from	a	cowboy	book.	"Walking's	good	for	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	pressed	her	lips	together,	shook	her	head,	then	smiled.	"Oh,	Luke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	set	his	book	onto	a	table	by	the	bed.	"You	know	how	far	it	is	to Hawkins	Corner?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"To	where?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	bunch	of	houses	where	Ethorne	and	the	others	live." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	blinked.	"No." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nearly	five	miles.	Sometimes	they	catch	rides	with	neighbors.	Sometimes they	don't." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	didn't	mean	Francine	had	it	worse	than	anyone	else.	Can't	you	just let	yourself	feel	for	someone?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Feel	what?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Feel--	I	don't	know.	Feel	sorry." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"So	you	can	feel	superior?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No!	How	can	you	say--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	a	hard	world,	Susan.	These	people	aren't	asking	for	favors.	They just	want	to	be	treated	like	anyone	else." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p172"></a>"I'm	not	saying	we	should	do	anyone	favors.	I'm	just	saying--"	Ma	shook her	head.	"Oh,	I	don't	know	what	I'm	saying." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just	let	'em	do	their	work,	Susan.	That's	doing	'em	a	big	favor." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	frowned.	"Are	you	saying	I	shouldn't've	had	them	in	the	kitchen	this morning?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"No	need	to	make	'em	watch	the	white	folks	eat." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	invited	them	to	eat!	I	practically	had	to	force	Francine	to	take anything!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	not	talking	about	Francine.	People	have	their	pride." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Luke,	the	Hawkins	told	me	what	they	had	for	breakfast.	They	eat	a	lot better	than	we	usually	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"You	mean	they	get	along	fine	the	way	they	are,	but	it's	too bad	about	that	little	white	girl." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	gnawed	her	lower	lip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well?"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	not	talking	about	any	'they.'	I'm	talking	about	Seth	and	James	and Mayella.	They	say	Ethorne's	a	fine	cook." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	a	pretty	good	cook	myself,"	Pa	said.	"So?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	they	ate	well	this	morning,	that's	all.	And	Francine	hadn't	eaten anything.	So	I	made	extra	French	toast.	Four	slices	of	bread,	two	eggs, and	a	splash	of	milk.	Is	that	too	much?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p173"></a>I	had	the	bad	feeling	as	I	listened.	I	slid	closer	to	the	TV	set,	but Little	Bit	looked	back	at	Ma	and	Pa	and	said,	"An'	surp	an'	coffee	an'	a glass	of	milk.	Francy	was	hungry." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	from	Little	Bit	to	Pa.	"And	syrup	and	coffee	and	a	glass	of milk.	Is	that	what	we're	arguing	about?	A	little	food?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	at	Little	Bit,	then	at	Ma.	"We're	not	arguing."	He	picked	up his	book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Luke?	Did	something	happen?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I	ran	into	Artie	Drake	this	morning." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	says	people	are	wondering	why	we're	not	giving	work	to	whites	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma's	eyes	went	wide.	"No	one	asked!	Except	for	Handyman.	We	gave	him some	work." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"That's	what	I	said.	Artie	says	they're	beginning	to	think	we only	call	in	whites	when	there's	work	niggers	can't	do.	The	hell	of	it is,	that	part's	true." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	we	didn't	mean--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mean	doesn't	mean	anything,	Susan.	It's	what	you	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	squinted	at	him.	"Is	that	why	you	hired	Francine?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	inhaled,	drawing	air	between	his	teeth,	making	the	sound	we	kids	knew was	the	same	as	a	rattlesnake's	rattle,	but	that	Ma	often	failed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p174"></a>recognize.	Then	he	exhaled,	saying	quietly,	"Is	that	what	you	think?"	as he	turned	the	page	of	his	cowboy	book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	watched	him	read	for	a	long	moment,	then	kissed	his	cheek.	He	did	not look	up.	He	did	not	move	away.	Ma	looked	at	us	and	said,	"I	think	it's the	kids'	bedtime." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p175"></a>On	the	day	before	Dogland's	restaurant	opened	to	the	public,	I	was playing	behind	the	kitchen	near	the	door	to	the	utility	room.	I	found	a piece	of	bare	wire,	maybe	six	inches	long,	near	the	place	where	Handyman had	extended	the	electrical	lines.	I	tested	the	wire	on	different things,	sticking	it	in	dirt	and	through	leaves	and	into	dry	pieces	of bark,	and	I	scratched	patterns	in	the	gravel,	mostly	for	the satisfaction	of	seeing	the	dust	fly	up	behind	the	wire.	As	I	played	with it,	I	worked	my	way	toward	the	front	of	the	restaurant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger,	sitting	on	a	blanket	in	the	sun	in	front	of	a	plate	glass window,	watched	me,	then	walked	over	and	held	out	his	hand.	I	shook	my head.	He	grabbed	the	wire	and	yanked.	I	pulled	back,	and	as	the	wire began	to	slide	from	his	hands,	his	face	began	to	contort	in	a	promise	of tears	and	yelling.	I	imagined	Pa	asking	what	I'd	done	to	my	brother,	and Ma	asking	why	we	couldn't	play	together	in	peace.	I	said,	"Okay,	Digger, you	can	have	it.	Don't	cry,	okay?"	Digger	smiled.	I	decided	that	I	had been	finished	with	the	wire	anyway,	and	I	left	to	build	a	race	track under	the	Heart	Tree	for	my	toy	cars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	walked	off,	Ma	came	outside,	calling,	"Georgie?	Where	are--	There you	are!	Didn't	I	tell	you	to	stay	by	the	blanket	where	I	could	see	you? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	you	have	to	come	inside.	I	hope	that	teaches	you	something.	And</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p176"></a>hurry	up,	because	Mommy	has	a	lot	of	work	to	do.	Tomorrow's	a	very	big	day." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	had	put	childproof	plugs	in	all	the	electrical	outlets	in	our	house, but	none	in	the	restaurant.	Digger	took	the	piece	of	wire	into	the	front room	of	the	restaurant,	where	Ma	and	Mayella	were	hanging	crepe streamers	from	the	florescent	ceiling	lights.	Ma	said,	"Georgie,	stay	in the	corner	and	don't	get	in	the	way,	all	right?"	Digger	nodded,	crawled under	one	of	the	tables,	squatted	by	an	electrical	socket,	and	poked	the length	of	wire	into	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	heard	a	scream	and	a	hiss.	Digger	fell	away	from	the	socket	as	if	he had	been	thrown.	When	Ma	picked	him	up,	she	saw	that	the	end	of	the	wire must	have	pressed	against	the	top	of	his	foot.	His	fingers	were	striped lightly,	but	the	wire	had	burned	through	his	sock	and	into	his	skin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	opened	his	eyes	and	began	to	cry.	Ma	yelled,	"Get	Luke!"	at Mayella	and	carried	Digger	to	the	deep	metal	sink	behind	the	counter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	and	I	came	inside	the	front	door	as	Ma	said,	"Here,	Georgie, this'll	make	it	feel	better."	She	put	his	foot	under	a	stream	of	cold water.	Digger	continued	to	cry	while	Ma	pulled	off	his	sock	and	shoe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	ran	in,	saw	Ma,	and	said,	"What	now?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	pointed	at	the	outlet.	The	wire	still	dangled	from	it.	"George	did	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	all	right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	didn't	go	unconscious." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p177"></a>Pa	gave	a	tight	smile	as	Digger	continued	to	scream.	"Well,	he's	sure breathing	fine." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"He's	got	a	bad	burn	on	his	foot." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kids	get	burned	all	the	time."	Pa	looked	at	us.	"Stay	away	from	that wire.	I'll	shut	off	the	electricity." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	and	I	said,	"Yes,	sir."	We	had	heard	Digger;	we	weren't	about to	touch	that	wire.	We	followed	Pa	around	back	to	the	utility	room, where	he	removed	a	fuse,	and	all	the	lights	went	out	inside	the	restaurant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	we	went	back	in,	Pa	said,	"Any	idea	where	he	got	that	wire?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"I've	never	seen	it	before." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"He	had	to've	found	it	somewhere.	What	about	you	two?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	shook	her	head.	I	said,	"Maybe	Handyman	dropped	it,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"You	need	to	look	out	for	your	little	brother." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Little	Bit	and	I	nodded,	Ma	said,	"The	burn's	deep,	Luke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Chris,	get	the	first	aid	kit." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"I	want	to	know	he's	all	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"You	can	hear	he's	all	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	lifted	Digger	up	and	stood	him	on	the	counter.	Pa	saw	his	foot	and winced.	"All	right.	We'll	help	that	bastard	buy	his	boat." </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	bandaging	Digger,	Doctor	Lamont	said,	"That's	a	tough	little	kid you've	got	there." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p178"></a>Pa	said,	"I	know	that.	Not	too	lucky,	though." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Lamont	said,	"I	don't	know	about	that.	He's	still	alive.	If	he hadn't	fallen	away	from	that	socket--"	He	looked	at	Ma.	"You	don't	need to	bring	him	back	unless	it	starts	to	smell	or	just,	well,	looks unhealthy.	Change	the	bandage	every	other	day,	or	when	it	gets	dirty.	If it	sticks	to	the	burn,	soak	it	in	cool	water	until	you	can	lift	it	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Don't	break	the	blisters	or	put	any	antiseptic	on	it,	nothing	but	clean water.	His	body'll	heal	itself	if	you	let	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Lamont	looked	from	Digger's	tennis	shoes	to	my	cowboy	boots.	"George might've	been	so	lucky	because	his	rubber	soles	kept	him	from	being grounded.	If	your	boy	in	the	leather	boots	had	been	holding	that	wire--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"Digger's	always	groun'ed." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	smiled	and	rubbed	her	head	with	the	palm	of	his	hand.	"Not	like	Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lamont	means,	li'l	darling." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Driving	home,	Ma	said,	"Luke?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shook	his	head.	"We	open	the	restaurant	tomorrow.	We	got	to	keep	a better	eye	on	the	kids,	is	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	night,	we	heard	an	automobile	park	by	the	restaurant.	Pa	looked through	his	and	Ma's	screen	door,	said,	"It's	Mrs.	DeLyon.	I'll	see	what she	wants." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p179"></a>Ma	was	sitting	on	the	bed	with	Digger	in	her	lap.	Little	Bit	sat	next	to them,	and	they	were	playing	a	game	that	involved	touching	Digger's	toes and	his	nose	and	his	stomach,	and	everyone	laughing.	Ma	said,	"Invite her	in,	if	she	can	stay." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded	and	headed	out	the	door.	There	wasn't	anything	good	on television,	just	Ed	Sullivan's	variety	show	with	some	stupid	singers	and dancers	and	nothing	really	good	except	for	Topo	Gigio,	a	little	mouse puppet.	I	said,	"I'll	come,	too,"	and	I	ran	to	catch	up	with	Pa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind	me,	Ma	said,	"Such	brave	guardians	I	have,"	and	I	felt	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	was	standing	beside	her	green	sports	car,	petting	Ranger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	the	only	person	who	didn't	work	at	Dogland	that	Ranger	would	not bark	at	when	the	sun	went	down.	Ranger	had	his	head	turned	to	one	side so	she	could	scratch	behind	his	ear,	and	his	tongue	lolled	in	bliss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Don't	want	to	make	him	too	happy.	He's	supposed	to	be	our watchdog." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	a	most	excellent	watchdog." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	at	her	car.	"Alfa	Romeo?	Nice	little	rig." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	gets	me	where	I	wish	to	go.	You	like	sports	cars?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Had	a	few	before	I	got	married.	Now	I	drive	whatever	gets	me	where	I need	to	be." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	nodded.	"Would	you	like	to	try	her	sometime?	There	are</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p180"></a>stretches	of	highway	where	she'll	really	open	up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I	can	tell." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	put	both	hands	in	front	of	me	and	twisted	them	together.	"Vroom,	vroom!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	both	laughed.	Mrs.	DeLyon	said,	"How've	you	been,	Christopher?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fine,	ma'm.	Me	an'	Ethorne	are	gonna	go	to	Texas	an'	be	cowboys." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	nodded	solemnly.	"Ethorne	would	make	an	excellent	instructor for	anyone	who	wished	to	become	a	vaquero." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	what?"	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	vaquero,"	she	said.	"It's	Spanish.	In	English,	you	now	say,	buckaroo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your	American	cowboys	learned	the	art	of	ranching	from	those	who	were there	before	them." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	a	buckaroo	an'	a	buccaneer,"	I	said.	"Ethorne	says	so." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Does	he?"	said	Mrs.	DeLyon.	Ranger	turned	his	head	so	she	could	scratch at	his	other	ear.	"Buccaneer's	French.	It	means	one	who	eats	barbecued meat.	The	buccaneers	lived	on	islands	in	the	Caribbean	and	ate	a	lot	of barbecued	meat." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	like	barbecue,"	I	said.	"We	went	to	the	Ol'	South	Pit	Bar-B-Q	for dinner	the	other	night,	an'	it	was	good." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	said,	"Then	you'd	be	a	fine	buccaneer." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Digger	got	burned	today,"	I	said.	"He	might	have	a	scar.	But	it's	on his	foot,	so	you	couldn't	see	it	'less	he	goes	barefoot.	A	pirate	should</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p181"></a>have	a	scar	here."	I	traced	a	jagged	line	on	my	cheek. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	said,	"Don't	worry	about	what	shows.	It's	what's	inside	that makes	you	a	buccaneer." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Like	barbecue." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	said,	"To	start." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"You're	welcome	to	come	inside,	if	you'd	like." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	shook	her	head.	"I	heard	about	the	Digger's	burn."	She reached	into	the	car	and	brought	out	a	gallon	jug	filled	with	clear	liquid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Doc	said	we	shouldn't	put	anything	on	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Except	clean	water,"	said	Mrs.	DeLyon.	"This	is	from	the	spring.	You'll find	no	purer	water	anywhere." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	laughed	and	took	the	jug.	"You	ought	to	be	selling	the	stuff." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	shook	her	head.	"What	is	truly	good,	you	do	not	sell--you share." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	laughed.	"You	and	old	Gideon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"His	heart	is	good,"	said	Mrs.	DeLyon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	sure,"	said	Pa.	"I	just	wonder	about	his	mind."	He	shrugged.	"We're all	entitled	to	our	eccentricities." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	said,	"Even	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"When	I've	got	time	for	'em.	Right	now,	I've	got	a	family	to raise	and	a	business	to	run." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p182"></a>Mrs.	DeLyon	said,	"Yes."	The	word	hung	in	the	air	for	a	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	about	Ethorne?"	Pa	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	frowned.	"What	about	him?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You've	known	him	for	awhile." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	could	say	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	he	dependable?"	Pa	shrugged.	"I	mean,	he's	bright	and	he	works	hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	can	tell	that.	But	I'm	thinking	of	making	him	our	cook,	and	you	want to	know	your	cook'll	be	there	on	time	and	ready	to	go	most	days." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	used	to	drink,"	Mrs.	DeLyon	said.	"But	that	was	a	long	time	ago." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	I	think	I'll	offer	him	the	job." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	smiled.	"I'm	glad.	I	hope	you	will	be,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ethorne's	a	good	cook,"	I	said.	"He	cooked	for	a	Spanish	man	named Cowhead	once,	and	he	says	he's	been	cooking	for	people	ever	since." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	laughed	and	rubbed	my	crewcut.	"Only	cowhead	here	is	you,	Kit	Carson." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	smiled	and	got	into	her	car.	Ranger	looked	up	at	her	window as	if	he	wanted	to	lean	on	her	door,	but	he	didn't.	Mrs.	DeLyon	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	be	a	stranger,"	and	started	her	engine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded,	lifting	the	jug	of	water.	"Thanks,	neighbor." </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	we	went	back	into	the	house,	Ma	said,	"What	did	Mrs.	DeLyon	want?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	set	the	jug	of	water	on	top	of	a	dresser	near	the	sink.	"Brought	some spring	water	for	Digger's	burn." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p183"></a>"Oh,	that's	sweet,"	Ma	said.	"She's	such	a	nice	woman." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"She's	smart." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"When	you	grow	up,	you'll	be	smart,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	nodded.	"I	know." </p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h2 id="calibre_toc_8" class="calibre4">Chapter	Five</h2>
<p class="calibre1">Things	Seen	in	Color,	Part	One</p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	woke	early	on	the	day	that	Dogland's	restaurant	opened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything	that	needed	to	be	done	in	advance	had	been	done:	white	wire tables	and	chairs	stood	on	the	restaurant's	green	concrete	patio,	and	a sign	painter	had	lettered	each	of	the	restaurant's	windows:	Doggy	gifts and	Snack	bar	and	Guided	tours	and	Bring	your	camera!	and	Entrance	with a	stylized	hand	with	a	finger	pointing	toward	the	restaurant's	front door.	Ma,	Mayella,	and	Francine	had	scrubbed	the	front	room	and	the kitchen	"from	top	to	bottom,"	as	Ma	proudly	announced	several	times.	She wished	her	mother	could	come	to	visit,	because	she	knew	the	place	would never	be	so	clean	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	had	mowed	the	open	land,	and	Ethorne	had	walked	the	grounds	with	a clippers	and	a	knife,	saying	he	had	every	intention	of	improving	on perfection.	Seth	had	lettered	several	sheets	of	poster	board	with	the information	that	the	kennels	would	not	formally	open	until	more	dogs	had arrived,	people	were	welcome	to	stroll	along	the	viewing	path	for	free, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p184"></a>and	please	don't	feed	the	dogs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	woke	at	sunrise.	Because	this	was	a	special	day,	Pa	left	to	pick	up the	workers.	Ma	dressed	us,	telling	us	to	stay	clean	and	not	to	talk	to customers	unless	they	talked	to	us	first	and	to	stay	by	the	house	and not	to	get	in	the	way	and	to	always	be	polite	and	not	to	yell	or	make noise	unless	someone	wanted	us	to	get	in	their	car	or	go	anywhere	with them	without	Ma	or	Pa	saying	it	was	okay	first,	and	then	we	were	to scream	for	all	we	were	worth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	didn't	want	to	wear	a	dress.	When	Ma	asked	if	she	wanted	to be	a	little	lady,	she	gave	a	decided	"No,"	so	Ma	let	her	wear	shorts, T-shirt,	and	cowboy	boots	like	Digger	and	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	Ma	helped	Little	Bit,	I	moved	my	rattlesnake	fang	from	my	plastic coin	purse	to	my	shirt	pocket.	I	always	kept	it	close,	so	if	people	did something	bad,	I	could	show	it	to	them,	and	they	would	know	that	they had	to	be	good	right	away,	because	if	they	were	bad	twice,	I	would scratch	them	with	the	fang	and	they	would	die. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	walked	to	the	kitchen	in	the	cool,	dark	morning	and	were	just	sitting down	to	bowls	of	Sugar	Frosted	Flakes	when	Pa	entered,	saying,	"Thought you'd've	finished	by	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	was	dropping	slices	of	French	toast	onto	the	griddle,	where	they spattered	and	sizzled.	"Your	daughter	didn't	like	her	wardrobe.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p185"></a>wants	to	be	a	cowboy,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	followed	Pa	inside.	"My,	you	surely	do	look	pretty	today,	Mis' </p>
<p class="calibre1">Susan.	Now,	you	get	away	from	there	and	le'	me	do	what	I	been	hired	to do,	hear?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	let	him	take	the	spatula.	"You	look	very	handsome	yourself,	Ethorne." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	glanced	at	the	others.	"You	all	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	squinted.	Pa	didn't	look	any	different;	he	wore	a	short-sleeved	white shirt,	tan	slacks,	and	brown	engineer	boots	that	he	had	polished	the night	before.	Ma's	hair	was	pulled	back	with	a	white	scarf,	and	she	wore a	new	green	cotton	dress	that	I	had	never	seen.	Ethorne	was	dressed something	like	Pa,	only	he	wore	a	black	tie.	His	slacks	were	black	too, his	socks	were	white,	and	his	black	shoes	gleamed	like	his	hair	and	his moustache.	Seth	wore	dark	sunglasses,	a	red-and-white	checked	shirt, black	slacks,	and	black	loafers.	James	wore	a	striped	white	and	blue shirt,	blue	slacks,	and	black	high-top	tennis	shoes.	Mayella	wore	a	pink dress	with	white	socks	and	low	white	tennis	shoes,	and	her	hair	was pinned	up	in	a	bun.	Francine	wore	the	faded	blue	and	white	dress	that she	had	worn	when	she	came	looking	for	work,	but	a	white	plastic	clip	on either	side	of	her	head	held	her	hair	back	from	her	face.	She	and	James grinned	when	Ma	spoke;	Seth	merely	touched	his	sunglasses	and	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"I	got	to	get	my	cowboy	hat." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p186"></a>Ethorne	said,	"You	got	to	eat	your	breakfast.	Everyone	what	counts	knows you's	a	cowboy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	studied	Seth,	James,	and	Francine.	"You	shouldn't've	dressed	up	to work	with	the	dogs.	Clean	and	neat	is	all	we	ask." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	the	first	day,"	Francine	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	looked	at	James.	"Splash	me	and	die." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Splash	you?"	James	said.	"Li'l	water	won't	hurt	that	trash	none.	But these're	my	church	clothes.	You	mess	with	these,	I	kill	you	first, Jesus'll	boot	your	black	behind	out	o'	Heaven,	and	Satan'll	have	you hunker	in	the	brimstone	so	folks	won't	notice	them	rags	o'	yours." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Little	Bit	and	I	laughed,	Ethorne	said	quietly,	"I	think	that's	enough." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"Dogs're	getting	hungry." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	touched	his	sunglasses	again.	"We'll	get	right	to	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	and	James	jostled	each	other	in	the	doorway.	James,	the	larger,	got through	first,	as	usual.	Francine	looked	at	Ma,	whispered	loudly,	"Don't Seth	look	pretty	t'day?"	and	giggled	as	she	followed	him	out.	Ma laughed,	too,	but	behind	her,	Mayella	frowned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	touched	Mayella's	arm.	"Right	now,	Seth's	smarts	has	gone	to	his head.	But	he's	bright.	He'll	figure	things	out." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	shook	her	head.	"That	boy	is	such	a	boy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Mist'	Luke?	I	was	thinkin'	'bout	the	only	way	you'd	make</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p187"></a>this	restaurant	prettier'd	be	if	you	had	some	flowers	on	the	tables." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	were,	eh?"	Pa	looked	like	he	was	hiding	a	smile.	He	pulled	car	keys and	a	roll	of	green	bills	from	his	pocket.	"Mayella,	why	don't	you	run up	to	Don	and	Roger's	and	see	what	ten	dollars'll	buy."	Don	and	Roger ran	the	Suwannee	River	Gift	and	Floral,	a	business	on	the	other	side	of the	river	that	was	full	of	things	to	look	at	and	smell	that	only	Ma	liked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Oh,	Luke!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shrugged.	"Isn't	everyday	we	start	a	business." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	took	the	money	and	the	keys.	"I	be	right	back." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	set	breakfast	before	us.	Ma	bit	into	the	French	toast.	"Mmm.	You sprinkled	this	with	cinnamon?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Simmon's	good,"	Little	Bit	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Simmanin,"	I	corrected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Yes'm.	I	was	thinking	on	the	specials	today--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Oh,	oh.	What'll	this	thinking	cost	me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Nothin'	more'n	what	you	spent.	Tourists	like	Southern food.	We	can	take	that	bag	o'	pecans	that	you	bought	fo'	pecan	pie	an' </p>
<p class="calibre1">offer	pecan	pancakes	fo'	next	to	nothin'--leastways,	till	we	see	if there's	much	call	for	'em.	An'	the	ground	sausage	for	breakfast,	well, come	dinnertime,	we	can	fry	up	a	hamburger	patty	an'	a	sausage	patty, put	'em	on	top	of	each	other	on	a	grilled	bun,	an'	call	it	a	Rebel</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p188"></a>Burger.	They'd	move	at	a	fair	clip,	I	reckon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"Maybe	we	ought	to	forget	about	the	dogs	and	start	a restaurant	chain.	Call	it	Ethorne's	House	of	Good	Eating.	Have	a	big sign	of	you	in	a	chef's	cap,	waving	a	spatula--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mm-hmm!"	I	held	out	my	empty	plate.	"More!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"More,	what?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	was	in	a	good	mood;	timing	is	everything.	"More	French	toast!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	grinned.	Ma	and	Pa	did	not.	Ma	said,	"More	French	toast,	what?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"More	French	toast,	now!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	and	Pa	frowned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Please?"	I	added.	Ma	and	Pa	smiled.	Timing	is	everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shortly	after	we	finished	breakfast,	Mayella	returned	with	a	box	of	red and	yellow	carnations.	While	she	and	Ma	cut	the	stems	and	put	the flowers	in	water	glasses,	I	walked	around	the	restaurant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	three-tiered	glass	display	table	had	been	placed	in	front	of	the dining	counter.	It	held	sea	shell	ashtrays	and	nightlights,	painted ceramic	dogs	including	Boston	Terriers	and	Dalmations	but	no	Huskeys	or kuvaszes,	dark	glass	beer	bottles	that	had	been	melted	into	ashtrays, clear	plastic	hemispheres	full	of	water	that	you	could	turn	upside	down to	make	snow	swirl	around	palm	trees	or	pretty	women	waterskiers, collapsible	cups	in	red	or	green	or	blue	plastic	that	you	could	carry	in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p189"></a>your	pocket,	white	saucer	ashtrays	with	"Dogland"	or	"Florida"	painted on	their	rims,	salt	water	taffy,	porcelain	mermaids	on	rocks	looking wistfully	into	bowls	that	you	could	fill	with	water	or	use	as	ashtrays, spoons	that	said	"Florida"	on	their	handles,	ceramic	alligators	with hollowed	backs	where	you	could	grow	plants	or	flick	cigarette	ashes, thin	beaded	leather	belts	spelling	Florida	and	showing	the	heads	of American	Indians	in	eagle	bonnets,	open-decked	pirate	ships	that	could be	filled	with	sand	to	serve	as	ashtrays,	table	lamps	made	from	cypress knees,	Confederate	war	flags	and	caps	and	ashtrays,	spice	shakers	with	a West	Highland	White	Terrier	for	the	salt	and	a	Scottish	Terrier	for	the pepper,	coiled	rattlesnake	ashtrays,	and	much	more,	all	for	tourists	and not	us	kids.	Pa	had	said	if	we	touched	any	of	it,	we'd	be	spanked,	no questions	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Confederate	soldier's	cap	tempted	me,	but	there	was	only	one	thing	I needed:	a	plastic	sword	with	a	golden	hilt	and	a	black	sheath.	Being	a cavalryman	was	better	than	being	a	cowboy	because	you	got	to	wear	a six-gun	and	a	saber	both.	I	pointed	at	the	sword.	"Ma,	can	I	have	this, please,	huh,	please?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	smiled.	"If	you're	good." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	left	the	souvenir	table	and	circled	the	restaurant.	Things	that dispensed	things	fascinated	me;	I	wanted	to	pull	the	paper	napkins	out</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p190"></a>of	their	holders	and	tap	repeatedly	on	the	metal	tongue	that	released plastic	drinking	straws	from	a	burnished	box.	Things	that	turned fascinated	me;	I	wanted	to	spin	the	round	seats	of	the	counter	stools. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Places	I	wasn't	supposed	to	be	fascinated	me;	I	wanted	to	run	behind	the counter	and	play	with	the	ice	cream	freezer	and	the	milk	shake	mixer	and the	griddle	and	the	shining	steel	refrigerators	with	their	big	latches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wanted	to	go	through	the	swinging	doors	into	the	kitchen	and	help Ethorne	make	pecan	pies.	I	wanted	to	stay	in	the	restaurant	and	play	tag or	hide	and	seek	under	the	tables.	I	said,	"I'm	gonna	watch	TV." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	pointed	at	the	highway.	"Look,	there	goes	the	school	bus."	I	watched a	large	yellow	bus	roll	past	as	Ma	said,	"You'll	be	riding	that	in	a year	or	two.	Won't	that	be	fun?	Riding	to	school	with	all	the	boys	and girls?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mm-hmm,"	I	said	without	certainty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	laughed.	"My	li'l	brother	loves	to	ride	on	the	school	bus.	He ain't	so	big	on	school	none,	but	he	loves	to	ride	that	bus." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	doesn't	he	like?"	Ma	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	you	know	chil'en." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	of	course,"	said	Ma.	"Do	you	help	him	with	his	homework?	They	say personal	attention	can	make	such	a	difference." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ain't	no	homework,	ma'm.	Hardly	ever,	least	ways." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p191"></a>"There	isn't?	Why	not?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ain't	no	school	books,	ma'm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No	books?"	Ma	turned	and	stared	at	Mayella. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes'm.	Well,	there's	some	books,	but	there	ain't	enough.	Not	fo'	all the	chil'en	at	the	colored	school,	you	know.	They	takes	turns	takin' </p>
<p class="calibre1">home	the	books	they	got.	My	brother,	he's	mighty	careful	with	them	books when	it's	his	turn." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	said	Ma.	"I	didn't	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	teacher,	she	learns	'em	from	magazines	and	such.	I	was	meanin'	to ask	if	them	Life	and	Newsweek	magazines	you	throw	away,	you	know,	if you'd	mind	if	I	took	'em	for	the	colored	school." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No.	No,	I	don't	mind." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	good	of	you,	ma'm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	it's	nothing.	We'd	just--	That's	all	right.	If	there's	anything we--"	Ma	bit	her	lip.	"If	there's	anything	you	see	us	throw	away,	and you	think	someone	can	make	use	of	it,	you	take	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank	you,	ma'm.	I	worked	for	one	woman	once,	she	fired	me	for	takin' </p>
<p class="calibre1">things	from	her	trash.	She	said	she	didn't	want	to	see	none	o'	her things	bein'	used	by	niggers.	That's	why	I	ask." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	see." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	laughed.	"I	think	she	got	mad	'cause	I	seen	her	hair-dye	jars. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p192"></a>Like	ever'body	think	she	was	born	with	silver-blue	hair." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	cocked	her	head	to	one	side	as	she	tied	an	apron	around	her	waist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	that	our	first	customer?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	heard	a	car	turn	onto	the	gravel	driveway.	Mayella	said,	"No'm,	that's Handyman." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	can	tell	by	the	engine?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	shrugged.	Ma	hurried	to	the	front	door,	opened	the	Venetian blinds,	said	"You're	right,"	threw	the	bolt,	then	tugged	the	door	open to	let	it	rest	against	her	hip.	"Tom!	Good	morning!	I	thought	you	were bringing	us	some	business!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	ma'm."	Handyman	stepped	out	of	his	truck	and	grinned.	"I	brung	you some	he'p."	A	tall,	somber	woman	with	tanned,	weathered	skin	came	around the	cab.	She	stood	half	a	head	taller	than	Handyman.	Side	by	side,	they reminded	me	of	Jack	Spratt	and	Mrs.	Spratt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Oh,	good.	You	must	be	Mrs.	Greenleaf." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	nodded.	"You	call	me	Lurleen,	Mis'	Nix." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	and	Ma	shook	hands.	Ma	nodded	at	me.	"Mr.	Bigeyes	there	is Christopher,	our	oldest.	That's	Letitia	building	castles	in	the	sand	box." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lurleen	nodded.	Handyman	said,	"I'll	be	by	'round	six."	His	wife	nodded again.	Handyman	touched	the	bill	of	his	cap	as	he	smiled	at	Ma,	then drove	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p193"></a>Ma	let	the	door	close.	"I'm	Susan."	She	pointed	toward	the	corner	of	the room.	"That's	Georgie."	Digger	was	sleeping	in	the	play	area	that	Ma	had built	with	the	wooden	slats	from	his	crib.	Pa	had	said	we	should	hang	a sign	on	it:	"Digger.	Breed:	Unknown.	Do	not	feed.	Pet	at	your	own	risk." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	and	I	thought	that	was	hilarious,	but	Ma	had	not	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	this	is	Mayella,"	Ma	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lurleen	looked	at	Mayella	for	the	first	time.	"I'm	Mis'	Greenleaf.	You	a Hawkins,	ain't	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	nodded.	"Yes'm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Vernice's	girl?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	nodded	again,	with	a	touch	of	a	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your	mama	washed	for	my	mama.	Now	that	I'm	workin',	I'll	need	a cleanin'	girl." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella's	smile	closed	on	itself.	"I'm	workin'	here	fulltime,	ma'm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lurleen	looked	at	Ma.	"She	waitin'	tables?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	blinked.	"Why,	no.	Mayella	will	be	clearing	tables	and	helping	in	the kitchen.	Why?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh.	I	was	wonderin',	that's	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	called,	"Ethorne?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	came	through	the	swinging	doors	with	an	apron	over	his	shirt	and trousers.	His	arms	and	hands	were	white	with	flour.	"Yes'm?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p194"></a>"This	is,	ah,	Mrs.	Greenleaf.	Lurleen,	this--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shoot,	ever'body	knows	Ethorne,"	said	Lurleen.	"You	fixin'	sweet	potato pie?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pecan,"	said	Ethorne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"When	you	fix	sweet	potato,	you	make	me	one,	hear?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	nodded.	"I	best	get	back	to	it."	He	returned	to	the	kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well."	Ma	looked	at	the	clock,	then	smoothed	her	apron.	"Let's	open	the blinds.	We're	ready	for	business." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	called,	"I'll	help!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Okay.	Go	outside	and	pick	up	all	the	litter	you	see,	and	I'll	give	you a	nickel." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	grinned	as	she	gave	me	a	paper	sack	to	put	trash	in,	and	I	ran	into the	sunlight,	leaping	as	far	as	I	could	from	the	sidewalk	onto	the gravel.	Little	Bit	was	squatting	by	the	Heart	Tree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Whatchadoin'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Talkin'." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"To	the	tree?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shook	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"To	who?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	pointed	at	a	squirrel	peeking	around	the	side	of	the	ancient	live oak.	When	she	pointed,	the	squirrel	scurried	out	of	sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p195"></a>"That	squirrel?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"His	name's	Ratatosk." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Watta-tot?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ratatosk." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ratty	socks?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ratatosk!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ratta-tox.	Pretty	funny	name." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	pointed	overhead	at	the	tree	top.	"There's	a	eagle." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shrugged.	"Ratatosk	said." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh."	I	kept	looking,	but	I	saw	no	eagles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	pointed	at	an	exposed	root,	next	to	one	of	Digger's	toy	trucks.	"An' </p>
<p class="calibre1">a	big	lizard	lives	there.	Like	a	alligator." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	see	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Way	down.	Underground." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	whispered,	"In	hell?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sneered.	"You're	telling	a	story." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ratatosk	said." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Maybe	Rattytocks	is	a	big	liar." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	nice.	He	wou'n't	lie." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p196"></a>I	considered	that.	"Is	he	friends	with	the	eagle	an'	the	gator?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uh	huh.	But	the	eagle	an'	the	gator	hate	each	other.	Ratatosk	runs	up an'	down,	tellin'	'em	what	each	one	said." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	shouldn't	tell	stories." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	isn't	tellin'	stories.	He's	like	a	mailman." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	silly." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	shrugged.	"Ratatosk	said	it's	a	job." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged,	too.	"I'm	gonna	pick	up	paper.	If	you	help,	I'll	give	you	a penny." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	couple	of	cars	of	tourists	arrived	while	we	scoured	the	grounds.	When we	returned	to	the	restaurant,	Pa	had	come	up	from	the	kennels	for	a	cup of	coffee.	I	gave	Ma	my	bag.	There	was	almost	nothing	in	it;	Ethorne's crew	had	done	a	clean-up	the	day	before	that	would've	pleased	marine inspectors.	Ma	smiled.	"That's	very	good.	Here's	a	nickel." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	since	you	were	helping,"	Ma	told	Little	Bit,	"here's	a	nickel	for you,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank	you."	Little	Bit	and	I	walked	over	by	the	front	door	to	sit beneath	the	counter	on	the	long	foot	rest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"I'm	gonna	buy	a	Baby	Ruth." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	saving	mine."	She	put	her	nickel	in	her	red	plastic	coin	purse, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p197"></a>then	held	out	her	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	at	her	palm	and	shoved	it	closer	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	got	a	nickel." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	said	you'd	give	me	a	penny." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	got	a	nickel." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	owe	me	a	penny." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ma	gave	you	a	whole	nickel." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	said." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Okay."	I	smiled.	"Give	me	the	nickel,	an'	I'll	give	you	a	penny." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	tell	Pa." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're	not	s'posed	to	tell	stories." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	not	a	story.	You	said	you'd	give	me	a	penny." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	got	a	nickel.	It's	not	fair." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's	not	fair?"	Pa	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	both	looked	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Chris	said	he'd	give	me	a	penny	if	I	helped	pick	up	paper." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	at	me.	"Did	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	"Ma	gave	her	a	nickel." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	kept	looking	at	me.	"Did	Ma	say	she'd	give	you	a	nickel	for	picking</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p198"></a>up	trash?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	you	told	Little	Bit	you'd	give	her	a	penny	for	helping?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	you	owe	her	a	penny,	don't	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	not	fair." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	not	fair	to	do	what	you	said	you	would?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	she	got	a	nickel	from	Ma." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shook	his	head	as	he	smiled.	"You	made	your	own	bed,	Chris.	A	man's got	to	stand	by	his	word." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"When	it's	not	fair?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Especially	then." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	dug	in	my	pocket	for	my	leather	coin	purse	with	cowboys	on	one	side and	Indians	on	the	other,	took	out	one	of	three	pennies,	and	handed	it to	Little	Bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	grinned	and	dropped	it	into	her	coin	purse.	"Ha,	ha." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	left	without	saying	goodbye	to	anyone,	crossed	the	gravel	lot	to	the Heart	Tree,	and	began	kicking	the	bark	with	the	toe	of	my	cowboy	boot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	awhile,	I	saw	the	squirrel	watching	me.	"Ratty	socks,"	I whispered.	As	it	ran	away,	I	chanted,	"Ratty	socks,	Ratty	socks!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Master	Christopher	Nix.	Wha'd	that	tree	do	to	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p199"></a>I	turned.	Ethorne	was	sitting	on	the	back	step,	rolling	a	cigarette	in one	hand.	"Nothin'." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	why	you	treatin'	it	that	way?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	like	it	if	it	treated	you	that	way?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	gawked	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	struck	a	match	on	the	walk	and	put	it	to	his	cigarette,	then	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	a	livin'	thing,	ain't	it?	You	think	folks	should	hurt	livin' </p>
<p class="calibre1">things	just	'cause	they	feel	like	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Stupid	ol'	tree."	I	kicked	it	as	hard	as	I	could,	then	walked	toward the	dog	runs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can't	all	live	in	Diddy	Wa	Diddy,"	said	Ethorne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stopped,	then	turned	back.	"Where?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Diddy	Wa	Diddy."	Ethorne	blew	a	smoke	ring.	"You	don'	know	'bout	Diddy Wa	Diddy?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	smiled.	"It's	right	close	by,	just	a	bit	too	far	to	get	to.	It's	not a	town,	an'	it's	not	a	city.	It's	where	the	river	runs	with	lemonade, an'	hamburgers	grow	on	bushes.	If	you	hungry	an'	you	sit	down,	fancy meals	on	plates	come	runnin'	by,	yellin'	'Eat	me!	Eat	me!'	till	you	got to	pick	one,	knowin'	the	rest'll	have	their	feelin's	hurt." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p200"></a>I	knew	Ethorne	was	fooling,	but	Pa	had	said	we	should	never	say	adults were	lying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	don't	b'lieve	me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	had	also	said	we	should	never	lie.	I	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	laughed.	"What	you	don't	believe,	you	can't	find." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	had	followed	me	out.	She	said,	"Ethorne?	Are	you	from	Diddy Wa	Diddy?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	laughed,	smiling	at	her.	"Yes'm,	Miss	Li'l	Bit.	I	was	the	Moon Regulator	for	a	spell.	But	hangin'	out	the	moon	every	night,	that's	some job.	Ain't	but	once	a	month	you	got	the	strength	to	put	up	the	full moon.	An'	then	you	so	tired	from	the	effort	that	you	put	up	less	an' </p>
<p class="calibre1">less	moon	ever'	night	till	they	ain't	hardly	no	moon	in	the	sky	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An'	then	you	so	'shamed	of	yo'self	that	you	put	up	a	li'l	moon,	and	then a	li'l	more	moon,	and	finally	you	get	so	prideful,	you	put	up	the	whole moon	again.	An'	soon	as	you	do	that,	whoosh!"	Ethorne	exhaled	and slumped	his	shoulders.	"You	too	pooped	to	pop.	The	whole	thing	jus' </p>
<p class="calibre1">starts	all	over	again.	I	up	and	left	that	job." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Who	puts	up	the	moon	now?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shrugged.	"Danged	if	I	know.	But	I'm	proud	to've	turned	it	over	to whoever's	got	it	now.	Don'	you	think	they	doin'	a	fine	job?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	Little	Bit	said,	"C'n	we	go	to	Diddy	Wa	Diddy?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p201"></a>"'Fraid	not,	Mis'	Li'l	Bit." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	you	want	to	take	us?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	drew	on	his	cigarette,	then	stubbed	it	out	and	shredded	the	remains, letting	the	wind	scatter	the	tobacco	and	paper	bits.	"Oh,	I'd	take	every living	body	in	this	wide	world	there,	if	I	could.	But	it's	easier	to find	West	Hell	than	Diddy	Wa	Diddy."	He	looked	up.	Pa	walked	around	the corner	from	the	front	of	the	restaurant.	Ethorne	nodded.	"Mist'	Luke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	grinned.	"We	did	all	right	this	morning." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	smiled.	"I	do	think	so.	Dinner	an'	supper	yet	to	go.	I	got biscuits	in	the	oven	'bout	ready	to	come	out." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa's	grin	increased.	"I	might	try	one.	Just	to	be	sure	it's	good	enough for	our	customers,	you	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sure	thing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	at	Little	Bit	and	me.	"Didn't	I	tell	you	not	to	pester	Ethorne when	he's	working?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"They	ain't	no	bother." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	know	the	rules." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	I	called	to	Chris,	so	I	'spect	it's	my	fault." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	not	a	matter	of	fault.	If	you	want	to	entertain	them	when	you're on	break,	that's	your	choice.	Just	so	long	as	it	stays	your	choice.	I don't	want	them	taking	advantage	of	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p202"></a>"Us?"	Little	Bit	blinked	twice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	smiled.	"Poor	Ethorne	isn't	as	hard-hearted	as	your	old	man.	He's	got enough	to	do	without	a	pack	of	kids	hanging	on	his	heels." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But--"	I	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	that	understood?"	He	used	the	voice	that	meant	it	had	better	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	and	I	nodded.	"Good."	Pa	pushed	open	the	kitchen	door	and headed	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	stood.	"Time	for	me	to	get	back	to	work." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Me,	too,"	I	said.	Ethorne	laughed	and	went	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"Chris?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head	and	ran	up	the	tourist	path. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	stamped	her	foot.	"You're	not	s'posed	to	go	back	by	the	dogs alone!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	be	a	tattletale!"	I	yelled	in	a	hoarse	whisper,	and	ran	on.	I passed	the	"Welcome	to	Dogland"	sign	and	raced	through	the	Doggy	Salon, my	cowboy	boots	clattering	on	the	concrete	floor.	Seth	and	Francine talked	while	James	brushed	an	Afghan	Hound's	long,	fine	hair.	They looked	up,	but	I	didn't	slow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	ran	to	the	northern	working	dogs,	the	Siberian	Huskey,	the	Samoyed, the	Alaskan	Malamute,	the	Norwegian	E</p>
<p class="calibre1">lkhound.	They	jumped	against	the	chainlink	fences	when	they	saw	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p203"></a>Captain	stood	against	his	gate,	trying	to	lick	my	fingers	as	I	lifted the	latch.	I	had	to	push	both	the	gate	and	Captain	back	to	let	myself in.	I	crawled	inside	his	dog	house,	which	was	dark	and	warm	and	smelled like	Captain.	He	crawled	in	beside	me,	pressing	me	against	the	boards	of his	house.	I	put	my	arm	around	his	shoulders.	After	awhile,	I	quit	crying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pa's	not	fair."	I	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Rr-ffh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pa	likes	Little	Bit	and	Digger	best." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	licked	my	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	yanked	my	head	away.	"Pa's	bad."	I	touched	the	rattlesnake	fang	though my	shirt,	pressing	it	between	my	fingers	and	my	heart.	Captain	lifted his	head,	pushing	my	hand	away	as	he	nuzzled	my	neck.	I	hugged	him because	I	was	cold.	After	awhile,	I	slept. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	woke	in	darkness	with	someone	calling	my	name.	I	peeked	out	of	the	dog house.	Captain,	on	the	small	porch,	wagged	his	tail	and	licked	my	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	was	calling	from	the	restaurant.	I	patted	Captain	goodbye	and	ran	up the	path,	passing	Francine,	who	was	guiding	a	group	of	tourists.	One said	as	I	went	by,	"What	a	lucky	boy."	I	didn't	know	or	care	who	she	meant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	green	sidewalk,	Ma	stood	with	her	arms	akimbo.	Her	apron	bore several	stains,	and	a	curl	of	her	hair	was	clinging	to	her	forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where'd	you	go?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p204"></a>I	pointed	back	at	the	pens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Never	run	off	without	telling	your	father	or	me.	I	thought	you	knew	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	want	to	have	to	tell	your	father." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	repeated	my	nod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	all	have	to	work	together	if	Dogland's	going	to	succeed.	I	may	not have	as	much	time	to	spend	with	you	as	I	wish,	but	that	doesn't	mean	I don't	want	to	be	with	you.	You've	got	to	help	me,	too.	Okay,	Chris? </p>
<p class="calibre1">You're	my	big	boy,	you	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	a	third	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good.	We	won't	tell	your	father." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	reached	into	my	shirt.	"Where's	Pa?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Up	front	with	two	new	dogs.	I	thought	you'd	want	to	see	them." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What'd	you	take	out	of	your	pocket?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged.	"I	got	an	itch." </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	circled	the	restaurant.	Pa	and	James	were	watching	Digger	stare	at	a low	shaggy	mass	of	golden	hair	with	thick	puffs	like	pompoms	at	each end.	James	wore	a	loose	blue	cotton	shirt	over	his	clothes.	Seth	and Francine,	in	the	Doggy	Salon,	had	worn	similar	shirts.	All	the	grown-ups at	Dogland	were	wearing	work	shirts	or	aprons,	except	for	Pa.	Pa	was	not</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p205"></a>like	us.	I	watched	him	grin	as	he	told	Digger,	"Hold	out	your	hand,	son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whichever	end	sniffs	it	will	be	its	head." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	laughed.	"Dog	like	that	wouldn'	las'	five	minutes	with	no	real dogs.	But	it	sure	is	pretty." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	Ro-Ba,"	Ma	said.	"He's	a	Lhasa	Apso.	Georgie,	can	you	say	Ro-Ba?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	held	his	hand	toward	the	taller	puff,	where	hints	of	eyes	and	a nose	lay	beneath	the	hair.	When	Ro-Ba	licked	his	fingers,	Digger	waddled two	steps	backwards,	then	sat.	Ro-Ba	licked	his	face,	making	him	giggle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	laughed,	except	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"Digger	figured	which	end	was	which,	huh,	Pa?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	not	very	sanitary,"	Ma	said,	but	she	didn't	move	to	separate Digger	and	Ro-Ba. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	dogs	have	all	had	their	shots,"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,"	Ma	said,	"so	has	George."	Then	she	heard	herself	and	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	was	crouching	beside	the	second	dog,	who	was	also long-haired,	short-legged,	and	golden,	though	he	had	a	white	crest	on his	chest	and	a	smoother	coat	streaked	with	black	along	his	sides	and back.	The	hair	on	his	head	was	swept	back	from	his	flat,	black	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	held	his	leash	in	one	hand	and	petted	him	with	the	other, saying,	"Pretty	funny,	huh,	Jo-Jo?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	approached	Pa,	Jo-Jo	turned	his	small	dark	eyes	my	way,	then	bolted</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p206"></a>at	me.	His	leash	slid	from	Little	Bit's	fingers.	She	yelled,	"Jo-Jo! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Come	back,	Jo-Jo!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	dog's	eyes	had	fixed	on	mine.	His	mouth	stayed	grimly	closed.	I stood	still.	Ma	lunged	for	Jo-Jo	as	he	approached,	but	he	slipped through	her	hands	and	bounded	into	the	air,	striking	me	in	the	chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	fell	onto	the	gravel	on	my	butt	and	elbows.	Jo-Jo	scrambled	on	top	of me,	sniffed	my	mouth,	then	scurried	along	my	right	arm.	As	I	gasped	and drew	away,	he	batted	my	hand	with	the	flat	of	his	skull.	The	rattlesnake fang	slipped	from	my	fingers.	Jo-Jo	leaped	after	it,	snuffled	in	the dust,	then	snatched	up	something	in	his	teeth.	A	small	crisp	sound	rang through	a	world	of	pristine	silence.	Then	bits	of	fang	fell	from	Jo-Jo's teeth,	and	he	whirled	proudly	in	a	tight	circle	at	my	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	ran	toward	me.	"What	in	hell--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jo-Jo	jumped	back	onto	my	chest	to	lick	my	face.	I	sputtered,	and	Ma laughed,	saying,	"Somebody's	got	a	new	friend." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	stopped	beside	her,	then	shook	his	head.	"I	thought	Pekingeses	were good	with	kids." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	smiled.	"Looks	like	that	one	is." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	up,	laughed,	and	patted	Jo-Jo's	head.	His	tongue	lolled	smugly.	I stood,	studying	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lose	something?"	Pa	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p207"></a>By	my	boot	lay	half	the	fang,	a	brittle	sliver	of	bone	and	nothing	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head.	Jo-Jo	stood	on	his	hind	legs	to	rest	against	my	hip,	so I	scratched	behind	his	ears.	The	morning	was	bright,	warm,	and	clear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	carfull	of	tourists	pulled	into	the	driveway.	Ma	said,	"I'd	better check	on	Mayella	and	Lurleen." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded,	telling	James,	"Put	the	new	dogs	next	to	that	Japanese	Chin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	should've	hung	up	their	signs	by	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sure	thing."	James	took	the	leashes	and	started	toward	the	Doggy	Salon with	Jo-Jo	and	Ro-Ba	in	tow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Can	I	go	along?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"You	won't	bother	James?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come	right	back." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled	and	ran	after	James. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	called,	"Chris?"	I	turned,	knowing	he	had	decided	I	should	pick	up paper	or	sweep	the	sidewalk	or	pick	up	toys	around	the	house	instead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You've	been	a	big	help.	Your	brother	and	sister	are	too	little	to understand	that	we	all	have	to	do	what	needs	doing.	I	know	that's	hard on	you	sometimes.	but	it's	all	part	of	being	the	oldest."	He	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	just	wanted	you	to	know	that	I'm	proud	of	you,	son." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	blushed,	nodded,	and	ran	after	James.	Jo-Jo	and	Ro-Ba	pranced	ahead	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p208"></a>us.	All	of	the	small	dogs	in	the	Doggy	Salon	barked	as	we	passed through.	James	laughed.	"These	li'l	runts	got	hearts	big	as	a	St.	Bernard." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	pens	had	been	left	empty	between	Tano	the	Japanese	Chin	and	Pierre the	Brussels	Griffon.	While	James	studied	the	signs	on	the	gates,	Seth approached.	"Got	a	problem,	nigger?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	nodded.	"Mist'	Nix	said	to	put	these	dogs	away." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This	one's	a	Pekingese	and	that	one's	a	Lhasa	Apso." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah?"	Then	Seth's	voice	softened.	"Oh."	He	pointed	at	the	signs.	"You were	prob'ly	right.	That	'g'	in	Pekingese	is	silent,	and	so's	that	'h' </p>
<p class="calibre1">in	Lhasa	Apso." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	nodded,	opened	the	gates,	and	let	the	dogs	in.	"Why	they	do	that? </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	want	it	to	be	hard	fo'	folks	to	read?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There's	lots	of	reasons.	Foreign	words	brought	into	English	hardly	ever follow	the	usual	rules.	'Course,	English	words	hardly	ever	follow	the usual	rules,	either.	Most	letters	that're	silent	now	were	pronounced when	the	printing	press	was	invented.	Then	people	started	sayin'	some words	differently." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Should've	started	writin'	'em	differently,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	grinned.	"Hell,	that'd	make	too	much	sense	for	white	folks." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	and	James	left	to	see	if	any	dog	runs	needed	cleaning.	I	patted	Jo-Jo</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p209"></a>and	Ro-Ba	goodbye,	and	ran	toward	the	restaurant	with	my	arms	outspread, being	a	fighter	jet	in	search	of	Nazi	and	Commie	planes	to	shoot	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	was	talking	as	I	flew	near	the	Doggy	Salon.	The	voice	was Francine's,	which	made	me	expect	to	hear	about	Chihuahuas	or	Mexican Hairless	Dogs	and	whether	they	were	native	to	North	America.	But	no	one was	in	the	main	room	when	I	stepped	into	the	shade.	I	quit	being	a	jet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francine	was	saying,	"No,	Cal,	I	can't." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	grooming	and	nursing	area	was	enclosed	by	two	wooden	walls	that stopped	a	foot	short	of	the	ceiling.	Ma	had	hung	strings	of	wooden	beads in	its	open	doorway,	and	the	sign	beside	it	said,	"Staff	only."	You could	only	see	inside	if	you	stood	at	the	edge	of	the	rear	door	of	the Doggy	Salon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	short	boy	with	blond	ducktailed	hair	had	backed	Francine	against	the far	wall.	An	acne	rash	decorated	the	side	of	his	neck.	His	thin	arms were	dark,	though	a	pale	band	of	flesh	showed	beneath	the	cigarettes rolled	into	one	sleeve	of	his	white	T-shirt.	"C'mon,	Francy.	Tell	'em the	baby's	sick." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	won't	lie." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	tell	'em	we're	short	on	cash.	That's	God's	truth,	ain't	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well.	Yes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	tell	'em.	All	I	need's	four-five	dollars.	Make	it	ten.	Tell	'em	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p210"></a>take	it	out	on	payday." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	Cal.	You	don't	need	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	tellin'	me	what	I	need?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No.	I	ain't,	honest." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	what	I	heard." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Weren't	what	I	meant." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	tellin'	me	I'm	hearing	wrong?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	barely	heard	her	whisper,	"No,	Cal." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	what	you	tellin'	me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothin'." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	nodded.	"Ten	dollars.	I'll	wait	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	Cal.	I'll	get	paid	on	Friday,	an'	I'll	give	the	money	to	my	sister." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your	sister?"	He	laughed.	"Why'n	hell'd	you	do	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"To	pay	her	back	for	lettin'	us	live	with	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hell,	don't	she	love	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francine	whispered	again.	"Yes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	heard	her	say	it	weren't	no	trouble	to	take	us	in." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Till	we	were	set	up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	we	ain't	set	up	yet.	You	give	her	the	next	paycheck,	if	that's what	you	want.	I	need	t'	have	some	fun	with	this	one." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p211"></a>"Ain't	you	s'posed	to	honor	and	obey	me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	up.	"I	got	to	think	of	us,	too!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	slapped	her	hard,	knocking	her	head	back	against	the	wooden	wall	of the	Doggy	Salon.	"I'm	thinkin'.	Hear	me?	I'm	thinkin'	for	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Understand?	Or	you	goin'	to	make	me	hit	you	again?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	would	have	run	for	the	restaurant	and	Pa,	but	that	meant	passing through	the	building	and	close	to	Cal.	Perhaps	I	would	have	done	that anyway,	or	maybe	I	would	have	circled	around	the	building	to	get	Pa,	if I	had	not	seen	Seth	and	James	crossing	the	field	toward	the	exercise	pen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	ran	into	the	sunlight	yelling,	"Seth!	James!	Hurry!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	came	after	me	from	the	Doggy	Salon.	I	ran	as	fast	as	I	could, but	Cal	caught	me	by	the	back	of	my	shirt	and	laughed.	"What's	got	in your	shorts,	li'l	fellow?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Help!"	I	yelled.	"Seth,	James,	help!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	button	popped	from	my	shirt	as	I	struggled.	When	the	hand	released	me, I	ran	forward,	then	turned	to	look	up	at	Cal.	He	smiled	easily;	I thought	he	looked	handsome	like	a	singer	on	Ed	Sullivan,	like	Pat	Boone or	Fabian	except	for	the	acne.	He	quit	laughing	to	look	over	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	you	want?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	followed	his	gaze.	Seth	and	James	stood	side	by	side	before	us,	saying nothing.	Seth	wiped	his	palms	on	his	trousers.	James	merely	stood	there, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p212"></a>watching.	I	ran	to	stand	between	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal	said,	"I'm	talkin'	to	you	niggers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	squinted.	Seth	said,	"You--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	interrupted.	"Mist'	Nix's	boy	called	us."	He	looked	at	me.	"You wantin'	somethin',	Chris?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	hit	Francine."	I	turned	and	saw	her	step	into	the	doorway	of	the Doggy	Salon.	Behind	me,	I	heard	an	intake	of	breath	from	Seth	or	James. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Didn't	he,	Francine?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shook	her	head	as	Cal	laughed.	"That	weren't	no	hit.	She's	my	wife." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	saw,"	I	told	Seth	and	James. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal	said,	"Ain't	none	o'	your	business,	Yankee-boy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is!"	I	said.	"I	saw!	An'	I	was	born	in	South	Carolina.	So	I'm	not	a Yankee,	neither!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal	smiled.	"Shoot,	that	sets	me	straight." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francine	told	Seth	and	James,	"You	best	take	that	Italian	Grayhound	out o'	the	exercise	pen.	Mist'	Nix	said	the	Blue	Tick	Hound	and	the	Airedale seem	to	get	along	together.	Try	'em	out,	but	keep	an	eye	on	'em,	hear?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	long	moment,	James	nodded	at	Francine.	"Yes'm."	Seth	continued to	stare.	James	touched	his	arm	and	turned	him.	"You	one	lazy	fool, sometimes.	Le's	get	some	work	done." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	watched	them	walk	away.	Cal	said	to	me,	"Ain't	you	got	somethin'	else</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p213"></a>to	do,	boy?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	laughed.	"You	best	find	somethin'	to	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Francine's	s'posed	to	be	workin',"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	just	talkin'	to	her	durin'	her	coffee	break." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She's	s'posed	to	be	workin'.	Pa	says	when	people	are	s'posed	to	be workin',	it	doesn't	mean	they	can	do	any	da--"	I	modified	his	original statement.	"--rn	thing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal	saluted	me	like	a	soldier.	"Well,	yes,	sir!"	As	his	posture	relaxed, he	said,	"You	don't	mind	none	if	I	say	g'bye	to	my	very	own	wife,	now	do you,	boss-boy?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	Francine.	She	wasn't	looking	at	me.	I	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	right,	then."	He	stepped	close	to	her.	"Don't	you	worry	'bout	your lovin'	husband	gettin'	all	bored	an'	havin'	nothin'	to	do	the	whole	day long.	I	'preciate	you	workin'	till	my	luck	turns.	Which	it	will."	He held	out	his	arms.	"Forgive	me,	sweet	thing?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	embraced	him.	"Oh,	Cal,	I'm	tryin'	to	think	what's	best	for	us	an' </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	baby." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	know	you	are,	honey."	They	kissed,	and	I	looked	away.	He	said,	"Tha's my	job,	too,	you	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	said	gently,	"Cal?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p214"></a>He	cut	her	off.	"That	nigger	boy	botherin'	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	frowned.	"Which	nigger	boy?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	one	with	the	glasses." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Seth	Hawkins?	Botherin'	me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	seen	how	he	looked	at	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed.	"He	di'n't!	Him	an'	James,	they	ain't	but	perfect	gen'lemen</p>
<p class="calibre1">'round	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal	squinted.	"Not	like	some	you	could	name?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	Cal,	I	didn't	mean	it	like	that.	You	treat	me	the	best." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"An'	don't	you	forget	it."	He	looked	at	me	as	he	stepped	away	from	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"See	you	later,	boss-boy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bye."	I	watched	Cal	walk	away.	He	looked	back	once	and	waved.	Only Francine	waved	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	said,	"You	don'	have	to	tell	your	folks	'bout	Cal.	He's	my	husband. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	un'erstand	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your	pa	really	say	that	about	workin'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	said	it	about	kids.	I	don't	know	about	grown-ups." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed.	"Grown-ups.	Ain't	you	the	sweetest	thing?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	down.	"I	got	to	go	now.	Bye." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	light	midday	rain	began	as	Ma	put	Digger,	Little	Bit,	and	me	at	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p215"></a>table	in	the	corner.	The	drizzle	ended	by	the	time	Ethorne	had	fixed rebel	burgers	and	french	fries	for	us.	I	ate	wishing	for	a	Confederate soldier's	gray	cap	with	a	shiny	black	visor.	The	lunch	crowd	kept	Ma busy,	but	she	returned	to	our	table	often,	mostly	to	wipe	ketchup	off Digger's	face	and,	sometimes,	Little	Bit's.	I	hated	ketchup	and	I	liked pulling	paper	napkins	from	the	metal	dispenser	(which	I	justified	by using	them	to	wipe	my	face),	so	Ma	didn't	need	to	treat	me	like	a	baby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fun	of	eating	in	the	restaurant	lay	in	choosing	your	own	food	and watching	the	diners.	Mostly	they	were	tourists,	young	families consisting	of	parents	and	several	kids,	like	our	family,	except	most	of them	drove	shiny	new	cars.	Many	were	older	couples	like	my	Grandma	and Grandpa.	Some	were	solitary	businessmen	in	rumpled	suits,	and	a	few	were truck	drivers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shortly	after	noon.	Ma	pointed	out	the	window.	"Look,	kids,	a	rainbow." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	stocky	grey-haired	man	with	a	patch	over	one	eye	entered	the restaurant,	followed	by	a	larger	red-bearded	man.	Behind	them	came	a slender	pale-haired	man	who	held	the	door	for	a	plump	blond	woman.	The three	men	wore	Hawaiian	shirts;	the	woman	wore	a	scooped-neck	green sweater	with	white	pedal-pushers.	They	walked	directly	to	a	table	near us	kids. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	red-bearded	man	grinned	at	me.	"What's	good?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p216"></a>The	slender	man	jerked	a	thumb	at	the	one-eyed	man.	"Ask	him.	He	knows." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	one-eyed	man	looked	at	them,	then	said	dourly,	"Rebel	Burgers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rubbed	my	stomach.	"They're	good." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	brought	menus.	"I	hope	the	children	aren't	bothering	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	said	the	pretty	woman.	"Not	at	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	asked,"	I	explained.	"Are	they	strangers?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Strange,"	said	the	slender	man,	smiling	at	Ma,	"but	not	strangers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled	back	at	him	as	she	told	me,	"It's	all	right	to	talk	with anyone	if	your	father	or	I	are	here."	Then	she	asked	the	visitors,	"Are you	performers?	I	mean--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	the	one-eyed	man	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	slender	man	laughed.	"Of	course	we	are.	Who's	not?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who's	not?"	The	red-bearded	man	elbowed	him.	"That's	good!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	slender	man	winced,	then	indicated	the	one-eyed	man.	"He	sees	all and	knows	all.	Beware,	or	he'll	tell	all.	Too	much	knowledge	of	what's to	come	will	make	you	glum	indeed." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	one-eyed	man	nodded	at	Ma	as	he	continued	to	study	his	menu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	this	is	the	strong	man,	obviously.	His	feats	of	strength	are	only surpassed	by	his	feats	of	feasting,	as	you	shall	no	doubt	witness." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	red-bearded	man	grinned.	"Break	anything	for	you,	ma'm?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That,"	said	the	slender	man,	"is	his	idea	of	flirting."	He	glanced	at</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p217"></a>Red-beard.	"You	know	she's	married." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	does?"	Ma	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	course,"	said	the	slender	man.	"From	your	care	for	these	three	fine children,	and	the	ring	upon	your	fair	hand." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	smiled.	"He's	not	the	only	flirt." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	agreed	the	one-eyed	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	slender	man	nodded	toward	the	blond	woman.	"And	this	is	our beauteous	companion.	Some	say	she	does	nothing	but	bring	joy	to	the world.	I	say,	what's	more	important	than	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	blond	woman	laughed.	"He's	shameless.	Why	do	women	love	the	company of	heartless	men?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Because	we	can	leave	them	easily?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	slender	man	frowned.	Red-beard	elbowed	him	again.	"Hah!	Got	you	there!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	slender	man	shrugged.	"Perhaps	I	deserve	it,	for	I	am	the	honest deceiver."	He	turned	his	hand.	A	yellow	rose	lay	there,	which	he	held out	to	Ma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	said,	"I	can't	take	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	said,	"You	must.	It'll	wither	soon.	Let	its	last	days	be	in	your company." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	will	not	wither,"	said	the	one-eyed	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	it	synthetic?"	Ma	took	the	rose,	smelled	it,	then	offered	it	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p218"></a>Little	Bit	to	sniff.	Little	Bit	wrinkled	her	nose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	as	natural	as	any	of	us,"	said	the	slender	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	touched	the	petals.	"Silk,"	she	told	Little	Bit,	and	then	she	asked the	man,	"Right?"	He	smiled.	Ma	said,	"How'd	you	palm	it?	You're	very	good." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank	you.	Would	you	really	know	the	secret?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	smiled.	"No." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	nodded.	"I	thought	not." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	made	it	appear,"	said	Little	Bit.	"Out	of	the	air." </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	of	the	adults	laughed,	so	I	did,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We'll	have	Rebel	Burgers,"	said	the	one-eyed	man.	"And	fries	and chocolate	milk	shakes.	Except--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	green	salad,	please,"	said	the	woman.	"And	hot	tea?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	course."	Ma	took	the	order	into	the	kitchen,	and	the	four	visitors began	to	talk	in	a	language	I	did	not	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	box	had	arrived	in	the	mail	that	Grandpa	Abner	had	sent	from	his	drug store,	so	we	kids	amused	ourselves	at	the	table	with	its	contents.	For Digger,	there	was	a	metal	bulldozer	to	go	with	his	crane.	He	examined	it with	his	fingers	and	his	mouth.	For	Little	Bit,	there	were	crayons	and	a coloring	book.	I	told	her	several	times	what	colors	things	should	be, but	she	ignored	me.	For	me,	there	were	comic	books	whose	covers	had	been stripped	and	returned	to	the	distributor	for	credit.	I	studied	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p219"></a>bright	pictures	and	figured	out	who	were	the	good	guys	and	who	were	the	bad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Ma	brought	food,	the	four	visitors	ate	with	a	great	show	of pleasure.	Red-beard	consumed	three	milk	shakes,	four	Rebel	Burgers,	and two	slices	of	pecan	pie,	then	laughed	when	the	slender	man	asked	him	if something	had	upset	his	appetite.	Little	Bit	and	I	laughed,	too;	the slender	man	had	asked	with	a	wink	at	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since	I	was	concentrating	on	Richie	Rich,	Kid	Colt,	Sad	Sack,	and	Jimmy Olsen,	Superman's	Pal,	I	paid	no	attention	to	the	next	table	when	they spoke	in	their	language,	but	when	the	slender	man	spoke	to	the	blond woman	and	laughed,	Little	Bit	nudged	me.	She	whispered,	"There's	a	snake an'	a	wuff	here.	He	said." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	slender	man	addressed	us.	"This	is	a	land	of	snakes	and	wolves.	Dogs are	the	children	of	wolves.	Who	are	the	children	of	snakes?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	blond	woman	looked	at	him,	then	smiled	and	shook	her	head.	"At	the risk	of	adding	fuel	to	the	flames,	I'll	remind	you	we're	only	visitors." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	grinned.	"Hardly,	m'dear.	Who	expects	us	to	sit	in	the	wings	when	the last	show's	almost	upon	us?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	red-bearded	man	shuddered.	"We're	stopping	at	the	next	bar	we	come	to." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	one-eyed	man	said,	"Yes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	was	helping	behind	the	counter	during	lunch.	While	the	one-eyed	man paid	their	bill,	Pa	spoke	with	them	about	politics	or	business.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p220"></a>blond	woman	came	back	to	their	table	where	Ma	was	clearing	away	the dishes.	"When	he	told	you	my	part,	he	didn't	say	that	I	kept	them	from killing	each	other." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	laughed.	"Men." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	blond	woman	smiled.	"What	is	not	acknowledged	may	still	be	valued." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	nodded.	"A	good	life	is	its	own	reward." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	blond	woman	laughed.	"I	pray	you	continue	to	think	so."	She	smiled at	Ma,	and	then	at	us	kids	or	maybe	to	Little	Bit,	who	was	coloring	an oak	tree	with	golden	bark	and	leaves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	four	were	leaving,	Mrs.	DeLyon	entered.	She	answered	the	slender man	when	he	said	something	to	her,	then	nodded	and	watched	them disappear	among	the	cars	in	the	parking	area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	grinned	at	Mrs.	DeLyon.	They	spoke	together,	and	Mrs.	DeLyon	laughed, then	came	to	the	table	that	Ma	had	cleared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Hi,	Maggie.	D'you	know	those	people	who	just	left?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hello,	Susan.	When	you've	been	here	awhile,	you'll	find	that	many return	to	the	spring	and	the	tree." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	Heart	Tree?	We	ought	to	have	Seth	letter	a	sign	for	it."	She	looked at	Mrs.	DeLyon.	"Have	you	thought	about	making	a	bigger	deal	about	your springs?	You	know,	putting	up	some	signs,	advertising?	Luke	loves	water fresh	from	the	earth.	When	we	travel,	he's	always	stopping	to	drink	from</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p221"></a>natural	wells	or	bathe	in	hot	springs.	Lots	of	people	are	like	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	said	Mrs.	DeLyon.	"Few	are	like	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	smiled	at	Pa.	"Well,	that's	true." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	glanced	at	us	kids.	"How	goes	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged	and	blushed.	Little	Bit	said,	"We	got	more	dogs,	Jo-Jo	and Ro-Ba.	Only	they're	little.	What	can	they	do	if	there's	wuffs	an'	snakes?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"There	aren't	any	wolves	here,	Letitia.	And	you	know	your	Daddy and	I	will	protect	you	from	snakes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	me,"	said	Little	Bit.	"Jo-Jo	an'	Ro-Ba	an'	Tano	an'	Mickey	an' </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sun-Up	an'	all	the	little	dogs	having	to	sleep	outside." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	protect	each	other,"	Mrs.	DeLyon	said.	"Wolves	will	not	venture near	those	who're	united	against	them." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good,"	said	Little	Bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	know	how	they	bark	if	a	snake	comes	around?"	Ma	added.	"Snakes don't	like	noise	and	attention.	All	the	dogs'll	be	fine."	She	frowned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Chris,	were	you	telling	stories	about	wolves	and	snakes?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	don't	want	to	scare	your	little	brother	and	sister." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This	one?"	Mrs.	DeLyon	nodded	toward	Little	Bit.	"Nothing	frightens her.	She's	an	amazon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Am'zon,"	said	Little	Bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p222"></a>Ma	laughed.	"I'm	afraid	that's	so.	She's	not	afraid	of	the	dark	or	of heights,	she'll	taste	any	new	food--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	away.	If	Pa	had	been	near,	he	would	have	added,	"She's	braver than	her	big	brother." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	course,	you're	not	prejudiced,"	said	Mrs.	DeLyon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	laughed.	"Not	a	bit!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"A	little	bit,"	and	the	women	laughed	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	old	is	your	Digger?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"George	is	two	in	February." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	very	quiet." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	frowned.	"Yes.	Some	children	are	slow." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	shrugged.	"Maybe	he's	chosen	to	keep	his	own	counsel." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	at	Digger.	"Maybe."	She	smiled.	"I'm	a	very	lucky	woman, having	three	wonderful	children." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	looked	at	Pa	making	root	beer	floats	behind	the	counter.	"Yes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	followed	her	gaze.	Mr.	Drake	held	the	door	for	several	tourists	who were	leaving.	As	he	entered,	Ma	waved.	"Artie!	Hi!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	came	around	the	counter	to	grip	Mr.	Drake's	hand.	"Artie,	good	to	see you!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	laughed	with	a	hint	of	embarrassment.	"Likewise,	Luke, likewise.	Susan,	how're	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p223"></a>"On	a	day	like	this?	Fine,	of	course,"	Ma	said.	"Sit	and	have	a	slice	of Ethorne's	pecan	pie.	On	the	house.	This	day	wouldn't	have	come	about	if it	hadn't	been	for	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	grinned	at	Mrs.	DeLyon.	"That	has	to	go	for	you,	too,	Maggie." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	wanted	to	be	your	first	customer,"	Mr.	Drake	said.	"But	I	see	I'm	a little	late."	The	lunchtime	traffic	had	lightened,	but	half	of	the tables	were	still	occupied,	keeping	Ma	and	Lurleen	busy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,"	Pa	said,	"you	can	be	our	first	freeloader." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Deal."	Mr.	Drake	sat	at	the	table	near	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	you	insist."	Mrs.	DeLyon	took	a	seat	across	from	Mr.	Drake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	certainly	do,"	said	Ma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Susan,	check	on	the	paying	customers,"	Pa	told	her.	"I'll	wait	on	our friends." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	smiled.	"I'll	be	right	back." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	grinned	at	her,	then	at	me.	"If	it	isn't	Cowboy	Chris.	And Miss	Letitia,	and	He	Who	Loves	the	Earth.	How	y'all?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fine."	Little	Bit	tucked	her	chin	to	smile	up	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	right!"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"You	kids	can	run	play	if	you	want." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	reading."	I	flipped	a	comic	book	page. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	coloring."	Little	Bit	touched	up	a	blue	woman	who	embraced	a	green	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p224"></a>"R-rrn!"	Digger	slipped	out	of	his	chair	to	push	his	metal	bulldozer around	the	base	of	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kids,"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Enjoy	'em,"	said	Mr.	Drake.	"They'll	be	adults	before	you	notice." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	said,	"How's	Gwen?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Boy-crazy.	Wouldn't	be	so	bad	if	I	liked	the	boy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Johnny	Tepes,"	Mrs.	DeLyon	said.	Mr.	Drake	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Boys	that	age	run	a	little	wild.	I	did.	Look	at	me	now."	Pa	held	his arms	out	wide	and	looked	down	at	the	apron	he	had	donned	when	he	went behind	the	counter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"There's	wild,	and	there's	wild." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	it's	easy	to	say,	'boys	that	age.'"	said	Mrs.	DeLyon.	"But	those who	behave	as	men	must	be	held	to	the	standards	of	men." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	arrived	with	a	coffeepot	and	two	slices	of	pecan	pie.	"Ethorne	says you're	to	eat	this	up	or	his	feelings'll	be	hurt." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Small	chance	of	that."	Mr.	Drake	lifted	his	fork. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How's	Ethorne?"	asked	Mrs.	DeLyon,	blowing	on	her	coffee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fine,"	Pa	said.	"Missed	work	for	a	day	or	two,	but	nothing	serious." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Must	be	nice,"	said	Mr.	Drake,	"tending	dogs	and	showing	folks	around who	only	want	some	entertainment	while	they	learn	a	little	about	pets." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p225"></a>"Must	be	nice,"	said	Pa,	"selling	houses	and	insurance	to	folks	who	only want	some	reassurance	while	they	try	to	do	the	right	thing	for	their families." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	want	to	switch	places,"	said	Mr.	Drake,	"call	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	laughed.	"Luke	happy	in	an	office?	You'll	have	a	long	wait	for	that call." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mmm."	Mr.	Drake	took	another	bite	of	pie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	said,	"The	new	woman	fits	right	in." </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	all	looked	over.	Lurleen	Greenleaf	carried	a	round	tray	propped	on one	hand	and	one	shoulder.	The	tray	was	loaded	with	dishes	and	glasses for	a	family	of	eight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	nodded.	"She	hardly	sits	down	to	rest.	I	don't	think	Handyman appreciates	what	a	worker	she	is." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	waggled	his	fork	at	Pa.	"This	is	a	good	time	to	start	a business	in	the	South." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	it?"	said	Mrs.	DeLyon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sure,"	said	Mr.	Drake.	"It's	taken	a	hundred	years,	but	the	South's recovered	from	the	War	Between	the	States.	We're	moving	on.	You	can thank	the	automobile	and	the	air	conditioner	for	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Or	curse	them,"	said	Mrs.	DeLyon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	smiled.	"Those	inventions	will	end	New	England's	control	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p226"></a>America." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"John	Kennedy's	from	Massachusetts.	I	figure	he's	got	a	better shot	at	the	presidency	than	Nixon,	Stevenson,	or	Johnson." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	agree,"	said	Mr.	Drake.	"But	Kennedy's	young,	and	a	Democrat.	He's not	as	tied	to	the	old	ways." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Will	the	South	vote	for	a	Catholic?"	Pa	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We'd	rather	vote	for	a	Texan	like	Johnson,	but	if	the	Democrats	endorse Kennedy,	the	South'll	vote	for	him.	Folks	down	here	may	be	Baptist,	but we	think	a	man's	religion	is	his	own	business." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yet	you	teach	it	in	your	schools." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	grinned.	"You	know	what	our	graduation	rate's	like?	We	don't force	anyone	to	learn	a	thing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	about	integration?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	Chief	Justice	carries	the	blame,	not	the	president.	You	see	bumper stickers	saying	'Impeach	Earl	Warren,'	not	'Impeach	Eisenhower.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everybody	knows	the	president	can't	enforce	integration,	anyway." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	smiled	without	showing	his	teeth.	"Who	sent	the	National	Guard	into Little	Rock	so	some	Negroes	could	go	to	a	decent	school?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	asked	Mr.	Drake,	"Would	you	like	to	see	the	dogs?"	She	looked	at	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">DeLyon.	"We're	not	charging	today." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"I	would,"	then	turned	his	grin	to	Pa.	"Don't	know	why</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p227"></a>I'm	arguing.	I'm	one	of	the	few	around	here	who	thinks	integration's inevitable.	What	Yankees	don't	understand	is	you	can't	force	it.	Folks need	time	to	get	used	to	an	idea." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded	as	he	stabbed	a	finger	at	Mr.	Drake.	"Ah,	but	will	folks	get used	to	an	idea	if	they	don't	have	to?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Did	I	mention	that	we	got	two	new	dogs	today?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	said	Mr.	Drake,	without	turning	his	eyes	from	Pa.	"The	South's lived	with	slavery	far	longer	than	it's	lived	without	it.	We're	talking patterns	of	behavior	that're	older	than	this	nation.	Can	you	change--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It'd	be	nice	to	see	your	dogs,"	said	Mrs.	DeLyon.	"I'm	a	great	admirer of	hounds." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	good,"	said	Ma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	laughed.	"Listen	to	me.	I	didn't	come	here	to	argue	politics." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	Luke	loves	it,"	Ma	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shrugged.	"Handyman	and	I	get	into	it	sometimes.	Only	thing	we	agree on	is	it's	nice	to	do	a	little	fishing	now	and	then." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	nodded.	"He's	in	the	Klan,	you	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	is?"	said	Pa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Handyman?"	said	Ma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,"	said	Mr.	Drake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ku	Klux	Klan?"	I	said,	then	realized	I	had	interrupted.	No	one	noticed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p228"></a>"Doesn't	necessarily	mean	a	thing,"	said	Mr.	Drake.	"Poor	whites	down here	join	the	Klan	or	the	John	Birchers	like	Yankees	join	the	Lion's Club.	I	can't	say	I	understand	why	grown	men	like	to	get	together	an' </p>
<p class="calibre1">wear	silly	hats." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Doesn't	do	much	for	me,	either,"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	raised	my	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	Chris?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Cowboy	hats	aren't	silly,	are	they?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	laughed.	"Nothing	John	Wayne	wears	is	silly." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"God's	truth,"	said	Mr.	Drake.	He	set	his	fork	on	his	bare	plate	and stood.	"Tell	Ethorne	he	did	it	again.	You	say	you	have	two	new	dogs?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Jo-Jo	an'	Ro-Ba,"	Little	Bit	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	Pekingese	and	a	Lhasa	Apso,"	Ma	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah,"	said	Mr.	Drake.	"Two	demon-fighters." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Say	what?"	said	Pa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lhasa	Apsos	guarded	Tibetan	temples,"	said	Mr.	Drake.	"And	Pekingese were	Chinese	palace	dogs,	known	as	lion	dogs	or	sun	dogs.	Very	small ones	were	called	sleeve	dogs,	because	the	nobility	carried	them	in	the pockets	of	their	loose	sleeves.	Pekingeses	are	said	to	be	descended	from the	Foo	Dog,	a	kind	of	a	household	guardian	god.	Your	family's	spate	of bad	luck	must	be	at	an	end." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p229"></a>Ma	and	Pa	laughed.	Mrs.	DeLyon	merely	said,	"Let's	hope	so." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	at	us	kids.	"I	think	someone's	getting	tired." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No!"	I	said,	and	added,	"Ma'm,"	when	I	saw	Pa's	look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	not	tired,"	said	Little	Bit.	"I'm	never	tired." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	laughed.	"She	goes	like	a	rocket	right	until	her	gas	tank's	empty." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	under	the	table.	"Yes,	it's	nap-time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	was	sleeping	at	our	feet.	I	said,	"I'm	not	tired." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	don't	understand,	Chris,"	Mr.	Drake	said.	"You	have	to	take	a	nap so	your	parents	can	get	some	rest." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Christopher,"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	and	stood.	Digger	woke	when	Ma	picked	him	up,	but	the	evidence was	against	us.	His	beginning	to	cry	made	it	worse.	Ma	patted	his	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	fell	asleep	again,	she	said,	"I'll	take	them." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"Need	a	hand?	I	used	to	be	pretty	good	at	getting	kids to	nap." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thanks."	Ma	passed	Digger	to	him.	Digger	opened	his	eyes	once,	then rested	his	head	on	Mr.	Drake's	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	five	of	us	walked	away,	Mrs.	DeLyon	asked	Pa	whether	he	found	any similarities	between	working	with	horses	and	working	with	dogs.	Pa laughed,	said	dogs	and	horses	were	nothing	after	working	with	kids,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p230"></a>the	door	closed	behind	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	paused	on	the	green	sidewalk.	Little	Bit	and	I	stared	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	looking	at	Dogland,	but	there	was	nothing	to	see,	just	fences	and bushes	and	flowers	and	buildings.	He	said,	"You've	done	a	lot	in	the past	few	months." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	smiled.	"Luke	has." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who	decided	to	plant	palm	trees	out	front?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	we	needed	something	to	catch	people's	eyes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So,	you	did?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	who	decorated	the	restaurant?	I	remember	what	it	looked	like." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	Luke	says	I'm	good	with	colors	and	things	women	worry	about." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	nodded.	"You	are." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"Ma	writes	all	about	the	dogs,	too.	She	wrote	the	signs on	their	doors." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Cause	Pa	told	her	to,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Someone	has	to.	We	all	chip	in." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	you	can	all	share	the	credit,"	Mr.	Drake	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Okay,"	Little	Bit	stated,	and	Ma	laughed.	Opening	the	door	to	our	room, she	said,	"You'll	have	to	excuse	the	chaos.	The	restaurant	gets	the attention	I'd	like	to	give	the	house." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p231"></a>"Tell	me	about	it."	They	both	smiled	at	nothing	I	could	see.	Mr.	Drake nodded	at	the	masks	of	painted	teak	that	hung	on	the	cinderblock	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	mask	scowled,	and	the	other	grinned.	"I	like	those." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Luke	and	I	bought	them	on	our	honeymoon.	We	took	a	boat	down	the	coast of	South	America.	It	was	a	late	honeymoon,	actually.	Luke	was	drafted right	after	we	married,	so	Chris	came	along	for	the	honeymoon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	did?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	nodded.	"Everyone	said	you	were	the	prettiest	baby." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	smiled	at	me.	I	made	a	face	of	disgust	to	answer	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Putting	Digger	into	bed,	Mr.	Drake	said,	"Sleeps	like	a	baby	'possum." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"He's	the	easiest	child	to	care	for	that	there	could	be." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Cept	for	me,"	said	Little	Bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Cept	for	me,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,"	Ma	said.	"You'd	better	prove	that	by	going	right	to	sleep." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	rolled	her	eyes,	nodded,	and	jumped	onto	her	bed.	"Okay." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No	fair,"	I	said.	"You	tricked	us." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh?"	said	Mr.	Drake.	"Looks	like	you	tricked	yourself." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	smiled.	"That's	what	Luke	would	say." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	lay	on	the	bed	with	her	arms	folded	like	Sleeping	Beauty	in	a glass	case.	Then	she	opened	her	eyes	and	said	to	Mr.	Drake,	"Tell	a	story." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p232"></a>"A	story?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	bother	Artie,"	Ma	said.	"And	take	off	your	shoes	before	you	nap." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Read	something!"	I	said,	running	to	find	The	Little	Engine	Who	Could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Christopher!"	Ma	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pumped	my	arms	like	a	train.	"Woo,	woo!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Maybe	this	wasn't	such	a	good	idea." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"Oh,	I	reckon	I'll	just	have	to	tell	a	story	to	quiet</p>
<p class="calibre1">'em	down.	Something	boring	that'll	make	it	easy	for	them	to	sleep." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Okay,"	said	Little	Bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Here!"	I	handed	him	the	book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	a	story	out	of	my	head,"	said	Mr.	Drake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	glanced	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	one	I	made	up.	One	that	I	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	set	the	book	aside	with	extreme	reluctance.	"Okay." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"You	take	off	your	boots,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	obeyed	her	as	Mr.	Drake	said,	"Now,	I	could	tell	you	the	story	of	the little	insurance	agent	and	the	head	office	that	wanted	everything	in triplicate." </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	grin	told	me	how	to	react.	"Yuck!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	Little	Bit	said.	"Thank	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Or	I	could	tell	a	story	with	knights	on	horseback	and	duels	and	magic</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p233"></a>and	quests.	Then	you	could	dream	about	it	afterward." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	one!"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Okay,"	said	Little	Bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	rolled	over	and	opened	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	took	the	chair	by	the	sink,	placed	it	in	the	middle	of	the room	between	the	two	beds,	and	sat.	"This's	also	got	love	in	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ee-yuck,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	okay,"	said	Little	Bit,	accepting	that	as	the	price	of	the	story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma,	in	the	doorway	beyond	Mr.	Drake,	shook	her	head	and	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	began,	"Once	upon	a	time	in	a	country	far	away,	there	was	a sword	stuck	in	a	stone.	Whoever	could	pull	it	out	would	become	the rightful	ruler	of	the	land.	And	there	was	a	boy--"	I	don't	think	we interrupted	very	often	as	we	listened	to	the	tale	of	the	boy,	the wizard,	and	the	country	that	needed	a	good	ruler.	The	boy	was	not	as clever	as	the	Little	Tailor,	or	as	brave	as	Jack	the	Giant-Killer,	or	as lucky	as	Jack	who	climbed	the	Beanstalk,	but	he	pulled	out	the	sword, married	the	queen,	and	gathered	all	of	the	knights	of	the	country together	to	do	good	deeds	under	the	direction	of	his	best	friend,	the best	knight	in	the	world.	"And	that's	probably	all	you	need	to	know	this afternoon,"	said	Mr.	Drake.	"I'll	tell	you	more	some	other	time.	It's	a big	story." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p234"></a>"They	live	happ'ly	ever	after?"	asked	Little	Bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	course,"	said	Ma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	nodded.	"Pretty	happily,	anyway.	When	the	king	died,	he	was buried	in	a	hill.	And	when	the	country	needs	him	again,	he'll	wake	up and	come	help." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	smiled.	"Did	the	king	an'	the	queen	have	babies?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well."	Mr.	Drake	looked	at	Ma.	"The	king	had	a	son." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"What's	his	name?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Somebody's	trying	to	keep	from	taking	her	nap." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"Does	his	son	have	a	story,	too?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	laughed.	"Yes.	It's	part	of	the	story	of	what	happened	to	the king	and	the	queen	and	the	best	friend." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"An'	the	lady	in	the	lake,"	said	Little	Bit.	"An'	the	wise	old	magician." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	all	the	others,"	Mr.	Drake	agreed.	"Now	you'd	better	go	to	sleep." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	right,"	Little	Bit	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	asked,	"What	happened	to	the	king's	son?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good	try,"	Mr.	Drake	said.	"Sleep,	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	think	I	fell	asleep	immediately.	I	did	not	dream	of	the	king,	his sword,	his	city,	or	his	knights.	I	dreamed	that	I	ran	through	dark	woods in	a	chase	with	rivals	I	could	not	see.	Though	I	breathed	deeply,	I	ran easily.	My	sleeping	mind	admired	the	grace	with	which	I	ducked	low	tree</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p235"></a>limbs	and	leaped	puddles	and	logs.	A	deeper	part	of	my	mind	wondered whether	my	running	self	was	the	hunter	or	the	prey. </p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h2 id="calibre_toc_9" class="calibre4">Chapter	Six</h2>
<p class="calibre1">Things	Seen	in	Color,	Part	Two</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	day	that	Dogland's	restaurant	opened	and	the	day	of	Dogland's official	grand	opening	have	merged	in	my	mind,	though	they	were separated	by	six	months	and	two	seasons.	Our	lives	must	have	followed	an uneventful	course	from	December	to	May,	excepting	the	interruption	of Christmas.	I'm	sure	at	least	one	box	came	from	Minnesota	with	clothes from	Grandma	and	toys	from	Grandpa,	and	Ma	must	have	commented	on	the strangeness	of	a	Christmas	without	snow,	and	Pa	must	have	been	very	busy and	very	quiet	during	the	holidays.	From	Ma's	holiday	newsletter	to family	and	friends,	I	know	that	Handyman	and	Lurleen	gave	us	a	bag	of pecans,	and	Ethorne	gave	us	a	jug	of	cane	syrup	that	he	had	brewed,	and Mrs.	DeLyon	gave	us	a	bushel	basket	of	bayberry	to	decorate	the	motel unit	that	was	our	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	world	beyond	Dogland,	in	the	world	that	came	in	discontinuous bits	from	the	television	news	that	Pa	watched	every	night	and	the	radio that	was	always	playing	in	the	restaurant,	these	things	happened	in 1960:	The	U.S.	denied	that	it	was	sending	reconnaissance	flights	over the	Soviet	Union	until	a	U-2	jet	was	shot	down	and	its	pilot	confessed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p236"></a>The	Belgian	Congo	received	its	independence.	John	F.	Kennedy	won	the Democratic	nomination,	chose	one	of	his	challengers,	Lyndon	Baines Johnson,	for	his	running	mate,	and,	at	the	age	of	forty-two,	defeated Republican	Richard	Nixon	to	become	the	U.S.'s	youngest	president.	John Updike's	Rabbit,	Run,	Errol	Flynn's	My	Wicked,	Wicked	Ways,	and	Harper Lee's	To	Kill	a	Mockingbird	appeared	in	print.	Albert	Camus,	Clark Gable,	Oscar	Hammerstein,	and	Mack	Sennett	died.	Preminger's	Exodus	and Hitchcock's	Psycho	were	released.	The	sixteen-year-old	Bobby	Fischer held	the	U.S.	chess	title.	Floyd	Patterson	took	back	the	world heavyweight	boxing	title.	Cowboys	rode	the	airwaves;	the	three	TV</p>
<p class="calibre1">networks	carried	twenty-eight	westerns	during	prime	time.	Chubby	Checker gave	the	world	a	new	dance,	the	Twist;	Little	Bit,	Digger,	and	I	would twist	naked	in	our	bedroom	to	imaginary	music	after	our	night-time baths,	which	made	Ma	laugh.	"Itsy	Bitsy	Teenie	Weenie	Yellow	Polka	Dot Bikini"	seemed	to	be	on	the	radio	whenever	I	passed	it,	which	made	me blush	because	it	was	a	song	about	a	girl	who	hardly	had	any	clothes	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	day	of	the	restaurant	opening	and	the	day	of	the	official	grand opening	are	joined	in	a	naptime	dream.	A	dove	flew	near	my	ear	and	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wake	up,	Chris.	There's	a	surprise	for	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rubbed	my	eyes	with	my	fists.	"Grandpa's	here?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	shook	her	head.	"Not	that	kind	of	surprise." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p237"></a>Little	Bit,	Digger,	and	I	followed	her	out	of	the	house	and	through	the afternoon	sun.	Had	I	been	older,	May	and	December	could	never	have combined	in	my	mind.	In	north	central	Florida	late	fall	was	a	time	for long	pants	and	light	jackets,	while	late	spring	was	made	for	shorts	and flip-flops. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	restaurant	was	empty	except	for	a	boy	a	little	taller	than	me	who sat	at	the	table	where	we	kids	had	eaten.	He	looked	up	from	a	coverless comic	book.	Behind	the	counter,	Lurleen	Greenleaf	nodded	at	Ma,	saying, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mis'	Nix,"	as	she	walked	over	to	stand	beside	the	boy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handyman	was	stout	and	dark-haired,	and	Lurleen	was	tall	with	strands	of gray	in	her	brown	hair,	but	their	boy's	hair	was	like	wheat	and	his	skin was	the	color	of	lightly	browned	bread.	He	wore	new	blue	jeans	rolled into	a	wide	cuff	at	his	ankles,	scuffed	tennis	shoes,	and	a	blue short-sleeved	shirt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lurleen	set	one	hand	on	his	shoulder.	"This	here's	my	Jordy.	Jordy, that's	Chris	Nix,	an'	Li'l	Letitia,	an'	Baby	Georgie.	You	say	hi	to	'em now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	stood,	smiled,	and	held	out	his	hand.	"Hi,	y'all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	did	not	move.	Little	Bit	said,	"Hi,"	and	waved.	Digger	sat	on	the floor,	then	crawled	toward	the	kitchen.	Ma	caught	him,	aimed	him	toward the	middle	of	the	restaurant,	and	said,	"Chris,	go	say	hello	to	Jordy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p238"></a>He's	Handyman's	son.	He	got	off	the	school	bus	here,	all	by	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imagine	that!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	offered	his	hand	again.	I	shook	my	head.	"Those're	my	comic	books." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Chris!"	Ma	said.	"I	said	he	could	read	them.	I	didn't	think	you'd	be selfish." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Grandpa	sent	'em	to	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your	granddaddy	sent	you	comic	books?"	In	Jordy's	voice	was	a	generous acknowledgement	of	my	good	fortune.	"Wish	my	granddaddy'd	send	me	comic books." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	doesn't?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nary	a	one.	He	give	me	a	quarter,	once." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My	grandpa	gave	me	five	dollars	once." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Chris,"	Ma	said.	"Don't	brag." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	he	did." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	still	shouldn't	brag." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Five	dollars?"	said	Jordy.	"I'd	get	me	a	B-B	Gun." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	would?"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're	too	young	for	a	B-B	Gun,"	Ma	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	so're	you,"	Lurleen	told	Jordy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	said,	"I	shot	my	daddy's	twenty-two	lots	o'	times.	I	shot	a	shotgun once,	and	I	'bout	fell	over."	He	rubbed	his	shoulder.	"That	thing	kicks</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p239"></a>like	a	mule." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	does?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	never	shot	a	gun,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	I	hope	you	never	have	to,"	Ma	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"E'cept	for	cap	guns." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	said,	"Me	an'	Daddy	go	huntin'	t'gether.	I	near	hit	a	squirrel	once." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Squirrel?"	said	Little	Bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	nodded.	"Squirrel's	better	eatin'n	chicken.	Daddy	says	the	price is	right,	too.	I'm	goin'	t'	hit	one,	next	time	we	go	out,	you	wait	an' </p>
<p class="calibre1">see.	Mama	makes	the	best	squirrel	you	ever	ate." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lurleen	shook	her	head.	So	far	as	I	could	tell,	she	did	not	know	how	to smile.	"Now,	Jordy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	do,	Mama!	It's	the	best	ever." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shook	her	head	again.	"Maybe	you	children	should	go	play	outside." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	leaned	down	to	whisper	in	my	ear.	"You	could	show	Jordy	the	swing	set." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Do	you	want	to	see	our	swings?	They're	pretty	good." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	shrugged.	"All	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"You	got	to	push	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	to	Ma.	"Just	the	boys." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	said,	"I	don't	mind	pushin'	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p240"></a>"Oh,"	I	said.	"All	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	smiled	as	we	walked	outside.	Little	Bit	made	us	both	push	her	on	the swing.	She	said	if	we	pushed	hard,	she'd	go	all	the	way	around	the	bar, but	we	couldn't	push	hard	enough	to	prove	that.	When	our	arms	had	tired, I	showed	Jordy	where	there	were	big	ants	that	you	could	cut	in	half	with a	plastic	shovel,	and	both	halves	would	wriggle.	Then	we	played	army with	my	plastic	soldiers.	Jordy	didn't	know	how	to	divide	them	up	and have	them	talk	like	on	"Combat."	I	taught	him	how	the	soldier	with	the pistol	could	say	things	like,	"You	go	around	the	hill.	Be	careful	so	the Jerries	don't	shoot	you,"	and	the	one	with	the	rifle	could	say,	"Yes, sir,	I	will,"	and	then	he	could	go	around	a	sand	mound,	twisting	from side	to	side	on	his	plastic	stand	as	if	he	was	walking,	and	the	German with	the	machine	gun	could	say,	"Achtung!	I	hear	an	American!"	and	shoot him,	but	while	the	German	was	doing	that,	the	American	with	the	pistol, a	sergeant,	could	shoot	the	German	in	the	back.	Since	they	were	my soldiers,	Jordy	was	the	Germans.	We	took	turns	killing	each	other's soldiers,	except	when	Jordy	tried	to	kill	the	American	with	the	pistol and	only	wounded	him.	When	there	were	more	Germans	than	Americans,	the American	with	the	pistol	threw	a	grenade	and	I	won. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's	play	something	else,"	Jordy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Cowboys."	I	ran	to	the	toy	chest	on	our	front	porch.	"You're	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p241"></a>Indian."	I	pulled	out	a	cap	gun	with	a	broken	cylinder	plate	and	a	rifle with	a	missing	hammer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's	both	be	cowboys." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	'Have	Gun,	Will	Travel.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Paladin,"	said	Jordy.	I	squinted,	then	nodded.	I	never	thought	of	the character	by	his	name.	I	thought	of	him	by	the	name	of	his	show,	his theme	music,	and	his	black	gunfighting	clothes.	"Who'm	I?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	a	second.	"Rowdy	Yates." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Wagon	Train'?	All	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who'm	I?"	said	Little	Bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn't	hesitate.	"Miss	Kitty." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	you're	Marshall	Dillon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	Paladin."	I	slapped	the	pistol	at	my	hip.	"Have	gun,	will	travel." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who's	Marshall	Dillon?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Digger." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	little.	Jordy,	be	Marshall	Dillon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	blinked	at	her.	"Chris	said	I'm	Rowdy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	nodded.	"I'm	not	playing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	said,	"She	can	be	something,	can't	she?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged	again.	"She's	got	long	hair.	She	can	be	a	Indian." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p242"></a>Little	Bit	said,	"What	about	Digger?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	can	be	a	Indian,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	grinned.	He	became	Sitting	Bull,	which	wasn't	much	work	for	him, and	Little	Bit	became	Geronimo.	Her	job	was	to	tell	Sitting	Bull	where the	pale	faces	were,	and	then	ambush	them	while	Jordy	and	I	rode	through the	desert	carrying	the	mail	to	Fort	Apache.	Digger	died	every	time	you shot	him,	which	would	have	been	fine	if	after	every	death	he	had	not immediately	sat	up	and	giggled.	Little	Bit	never	died	and	would	only	be wounded	for	a	minute	or	two,	even	though	Paladin	never	missed	and	Rowdy Yates	only	missed	sometimes.	Finally	I	said	Little	Bit	was	dead	and	I wasn't	going	to	play	any	more,	so	Jordy	and	I	won,	even	though	Little Bit	said,	"Did	not!"	and	she	and	Digger	began	a	war	dance	around	the sand	box. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	was	sitting	in	a	lawn	chair	under	the	Heart	Tree,	reading	a paperback.	I	ran	and	asked	if	I	could	show	Jordy	the	dogs.	She	said	that was	fine	if	we	stayed	on	the	path	and	didn't	go	inside	any	of	the	pens and	didn't	bother	any	of	the	visitors	or	any	of	the	help.	I	nodded, yelled,	"C'mon,	Jordy!"	and	we	ran	away,	shooting	Indians	in	the	bushes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pow!	Pow!	Pow!"	We	hit	every	single	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	wanted	to	look	at	each	dog,	so	I	told	him	about	them	as	we	walked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	Bambi,	the	Basenji.	They	don't	bark,	an'	they	keep	themselves</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p243"></a>clean	like	cats.	They're	real	old.	There	were	Basenjis	in	ancient	Egypt with	the	Pharaohs.	Bambi's	one	of	my	favorites." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	said	that	English	Bulldog	was	one	of	your	favorites." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bo-peep's	one	of	my	favorites,	too.	That's	Percy.	He	bit	Pa	real	bad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	says	you	don't	want	to	scare	Percy."	I	held	out	my	hand	and	let Percy	lick	my	palm.	"Here's	the	Dachshunds.	Whizkee's	a	wire-hair,	an' </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sun-Up's	a	reg'lar	Dachshund,	an'	Pandora's	a	miniature	wire-hair,	and Dev	is	a	long-hair.	Dev's	the	best,	or	maybe	Whizkee."	Whizkee's	name made	us	both	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	can	play	with	'em	whenever	you	want?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged.	"That's	Driver.	He's	a	Otter	Hound.	I	don't	know	what	he oughter	do."	Jordy	laughed,	and	I	started	running.	"C'mon!	This's Ranger.	He's	a	kuvasz.	He	caught	somebody	once	when	Pa	wasn't	here.	A drunk." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	dang	big." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah."	I	stuck	my	hand	in	the	cage	and	scratched	Ranger	through	his thick	white	coat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can	I	pet	him?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	you're	careful,"	I	said,	though	it	was	daytime.	Ma	said	Ranger	loved everybody	when	the	sun	was	up	and	only	our	family	when	the	sun	had	set. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Boy."	Jordy	grinned	as	Ranger	let	him	rub	his	skull.	"That's	sure	some</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p244"></a>dog." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	guards	the	kings	of	Hungary." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where's	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In	central	Europe,"	Seth	said	behind	us.	"It's	ruled	by	the	Soviet Union	now	and	hasn't	had	a	king	for	some	time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	and	I	turned.	Jordy	stared.	"You	sound	like	a	white	man." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	Seth,"	I	said.	"This	is	Jordy.	He's	Handyman's	boy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	rolled	his	eyes.	"Should've	guessed." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	come	they	haven't	got	a	king?"	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In	Hungary?"	Seth	picked	up	a	hose	and	turned	on	the	faucet.	"They	got rid	of	them.	If	your	oppressors	won't	free	you,	you've	to	free yourself."	He	began	rinsing	the	dog	runs.	The	Great	Dane's	run	always needed	cleaning.	"That's	what	America's	about,	isn't	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	and	I	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	said,	"We	don't	have	a	king,	do	we?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head.	"President." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	right.	Americans	don't	like	kings." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	said,	"Martin	Luther	King." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	smiled.	"Well,	we	like	one." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	we	don't!"	Jordy	said.	"He's	a	Com'nist	agitator!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Seth	frowned,	I	said,	"King	Arthur." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p245"></a>Seth	laughed.	"Yeah,	we	like	fairy-tale	kings	who're	so	far	removed	from reality	that	they	quit	looking	like	heartless	exploiters	of	the	poor." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	and	I	squinted	at	him.	He	waved	his	free	hand.	"Forget	it.	Want	a sprinkle?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	glanced	at	me.	I	grinned	and	nodded.	Seth	flicked	the	hose, catching	us	in	its	cool	spray.	Jordy	ran	for	the	restaurant	and	I followed,	laughing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	approached	the	Doggy	Salon,	Pa	and	James	pushed	two	wheelbarrows full	of	warm	dog	food	onto	the	viewing	path.	Pa	let	his	wheelbarrow	down and	squatted	in	front	of	us.	Jordy	came	to	a	stop,	but	I	kept	running. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	caught	me	around	the	waist	with	one	arm,	then	stood,	turning	me upside	down	and	setting	me	back	on	my	feet.	James,	Pa,	and	I	all	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So,"	he	said.	"Who've	you	outlaws	been	terrorizing?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	pointed	toward	the	pens.	"That	nigger	got	us	wet!	He	turned	a	hose on	us	like	we	was	dogs!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa's	face	settled	like	the	scowling	mask	on	our	bedroom	wall.	James watched	with	no	expression	that	I	could	see.	Pa	looked	at	me.	"That	so?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	Jordy,	then	back	at	Pa	and	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	asked.	I	said	okay." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	glanced	at	me.	"Di'n't	ask	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p246"></a>"Asked	us	both.	I	said	it	was	okay." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	di'n't	say	no	nigger	could	squirt	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Seth	sprinkled	you?"	Jordy	and	I	nodded,	and	Pa	did,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	then,	Jordy,	show	me	your	wounds." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	blinked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	must've	hurt	you	pretty	bad,	seeing	how	upset	you	are.	Just	show	me what	he	did,	and	I'll	call	the	sheriff." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	looked	down	at	himself,	then	held	out	his	shirt,	showing	the	damp speckles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What'd	he	get	you	with?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Water,"	Jordy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	else?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just	water." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	melt	in	water?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	shook	his	head.	James	grinned,	but	Jordy	did	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I	don't	think	the	sheriff's	going	to	be	impressed." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	nigger	hosed	water	on	me!"	Jordy	seemed	angry	enough	to	cry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"His	name's	Seth,"	said	Pa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	introduced	them,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p247"></a>Jordy	said,	"My	Daddy'll	make	him	sorry." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	looked	at	Pa.	Pa	rolled	his	eyes	and	said,	"That's	what	you	want? </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	hear	Seth	say	he's	sorry?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come	on."	Pa	pushed	the	wheelbarrow	to	the	first	set	of	dog	pens	and left	it	sitting	in	the	path.	We	walked	on	while	most	of	the	dogs	ran back	and	forth,	baying	their	bafflement	at	our	priorities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Seth?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	took	his	thumb	off	the	end	of	the	hose	he	was	using	to	clean	the bull	terrier's	pen.	"Mister	Nix?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	understand	you	sprayed	these	boys." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	glanced	at	me.	I	had	hurt	him,	though	I	did	not	know	how.	He	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Why?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	thought	Chris	liked	it.	I	didn't	hurt	his	clothes,	did	I?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No."	Pa	did	not	look	at	my	clothes.	Even	if	Seth	had	stained	my	best shirt,	Pa	would	not	have	noticed	or	cared	unless	Ma	had	insisted	on buying	a	new	one.	"Jordy	had	his	feelings	hurt." </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	stepped	up	beside	Pa.	Jordy	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh?	Sorry,"	Seth	said.	"Thought	you	both'd	like	a	splash	of	cold	water." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	did,"	I	said,	and	Seth	grinned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	good	enough	for	you?"	said	Pa,	looking	at	Jordy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p248"></a>"Good	enough	for	what?"	said	Seth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	the	kid	thought	he	needed	an	apology." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	nodded.	Seth	squinted,	saying,	"Needed?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	had	followed	us.	He	said,	"Tha's	fine." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	said,	"What'd	I	do	that	needed	an	apology?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	'pologized,"	James	said.	"That's	the	Christian	thing	to	do,	right or	wrong." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait,"	said	Seth.	"Wrong?	We're	not	talking	about	a	matter	of	right	or wrong	here.	There	was	just	a	misunderstanding--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tha's	right,"	said	James.	"A	misunderstanding,	that's	all.	Chris,	I seen	a	heap	o'	Indians	on	the	far	side	o'	your	house.	I	bet	you	an' </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	could	capture	'em	all	if	you	headed	out	runnin'." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	wanted	to	help	feed	the	dogs." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I	don't	know--"	as	Seth	said,	"Even	if	I	splashed	you	again?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	cocked	his	head,	then	said,	"I	reckon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	three	men	smiled.	Pa	said,	"You	two	can	help	feed	the	dogs	so	long as	you	obey	Seth	and	James.	If	I	hear	you	disobey	'em,	you	can't	come out	here	anymore.	Is	that	understood?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yessir,"	Jordy	and	I	said	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	right,	then.	Seth,	take	the	other	wheelbarrow.	I'll	be	up	front	if</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p249"></a>you	need	me."	Pa	studied	Jordy	and	me.	"If	either	of	these	two	act	up, let	me	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	won't,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	walked	off.	Jordy	and	I	followed	Seth	and	James	back	toward	the wheelbarrows.	Seth	said,	"New	York	City.	When	I	get	enough	for	a	bus ticket	and	a	bit	to	live	on,	I'm	going	to	New	York	City." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ethorne	be	disappointed,"	James	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	can	come	to	New	York,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	smiled.	"They's	worse	things	to	be	called	than	college	boy,	y'know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Education's	something	you	do,	not	something	that's	done	to	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There's	places	where	it's	easier	to	do.	Ever'body	'xpects	you	to	go back	next	term." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Everybody	expects	a	lot." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	said,	"You	really	go	to	college?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	looked	down	at	him.	"Why,	yes.	I	really	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	why	you	talk	like	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Must	be." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francine	was	escorting	a	last	group	of	tourists	around	the	path.	Seth looked	at	them,	then	glanced	away	with	a	grimace.	To	my	surprise, Francine's	husband	listened	at	the	back	of	the	tourist	group,	which consisted	of	an	old	lady	in	Bermuda	shorts,	several	children	much	older</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p250"></a>than	me,	three	or	four	adults	in	sports	clothes,	a	well-dressed dark-skinned	couple,	Cal	Carter,	and	a	taller,	stockier	youth	with Brylcreamed	hair.	Cal	wore	wraparound	sunglasses,	a	pink	shortsleeved shirt,	and	crisp	new	jeans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stopped	walking.	Jordy	stopped	beside	me.	We	listened	to	Francine saying,	"Dogs	that	hunt	their	prey	by	sight	are	called	sight-hounds	or gaze-hounds.	They	tend	to	be	large	and	fast,	like	the	Irish	Wolfhound	or the	Greyhound.	Dogs	that	hunt	by	smell	are	called	scent-hounds.	They tend	to	be	small	and	tenacious,	like	Beagles,	Basset	Hounds,	and Dachshunds." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	led	the	group	from	one	set	of	runs	toward	another.	Cal,	following behind,	told	his	companion,	"Bet	you'd	like	to	take	one	o'	those	out	one night,	see	what	she	could	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	other	said,	"Wouldn't	a	li'l	Dachshund'd	be	more	your	speed?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal	pointed	toward	Francine,	or	perhaps	just	past	her,	at	one	of	the racing	dogs.	"Nice	lines	on	that	bitch	there,	Victor.	Looks	like	she could	move	out	right	quick,	don't	she?"	He	smiled	and	raised	his	voice slightly.	"You	can	tell	she	gets	what	she's	after	in	the	dark." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	older	woman	in	Bermuda	shorts	looked	back	at	him.	Francine	turned	to say,	"Sight	hounds	and	scent	hounds	both	get	around	better	in	the	dark than	most	folks.	But	these	dogs	aren't	available	to	rent	or	borrow.	If</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p251"></a>you're	thinkin'	on	buying	one--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Victor	shook	his	head.	"My	ol'	man's	the	banker.	Wouldn't	I	just	be checkin'	the	collatoral	on	your	loan?"	When	he	said	that,	I	could	see that	Victor	looked	like	a	younger,	softer	version	of	Mr.	Dalton,	who always	gave	us	lollipops	at	the	Dickison	State	Bank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francine	said,	"I	really	don't	think	so." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Victor	Dalton	nodded.	"What's	to	keep	someone	from	wandering	in	here	to borrow	a	dog	he	fancied?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francine	frowned,	narrowed	her	eyes	at	Cal,	and	told	Victor,	"There's always	someone	on	the	grounds.	Wait'll	I	show	you	the	watchdog	they	let out	at	night." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal	said,	"Victor's	real	concerned	that	dogs're	treated	right.	Which you'd	understand	if	you	ever	seen	him	on	a	date." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Victor	grunted	in	anger	or	amusement	and	shoved	Cal's	shoulder,	knocking him	off	the	path.	Cal	splashed	into	a	shallow	puddle	and	stood	there, water	seeping	into	his	brown	loafers,	as	he	grinned.	"Yep,	Victor's	the original	hound	dog.	Your	boss	ought	to	put	him	on	display." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francine	said,	"I	ought	to	put	you	two	out	to	run	in	the	exercise	pen	is what	I	ought	to	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Victor	frowned.	Cal	smiled,	stepped	out	of	the	puddle,	and	neatly	wiped his	loafers	on	the	grass,	telling	Francine,	"Folks're	waiting,	Mis' </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p252"></a>Tourist	Guide.	I'd	hate	to	think	they's	waitin'	on	us." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	rest	of	the	tourists	had	stopped	in	front	of	the	next	set	of	dog runs.	Francine	hurried	to	stand	before	them,	resuming	the	speech	that	Ma had	written.	Jordy	listened	as	though	she	were	Captain	Kangaroo,	Sheri Lewis,	and	Bozo	rolled	into	one,	but	I	knew	the	script	by	heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	two	dark-skinned	visitors	did	not	look	like	the	Negroes	I	had	seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	hair	was	straight,	and	their	clothes	were	conservatively expensive,	and	they	carried	themselves	with	an	unthinking	assertiveness that	marked	them	as	foreigners	before	they	spoke.	While	the	rest	had waited	for	Francine,	the	dark	couple	had	watched	the	dogs,	but	as Francine's	speech	began	again,	the	man	smiled	at	Victor	Dalton,	who frowned,	and	then	interrupted	Francine.	"What	do	you	do	with	the	dogs who	die?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	in	Bermuda	shorts	gave	him	a	scathing	glance.	Francine	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ain't	no	dogs	died,	mister." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	his	hands	palms-up.	"All	creatures	are	mortal." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why,	um,	yes,	sir,	that's	Bible-true,"	said	Francine.	"Now--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Have	you	considered	a	canine	mausoleum?"	said	the	man.	"With	statues	or paintings	of	the	dogs	who	had	died?	A	monument	would	require	less	care than	living	dogs	do,	and	offer	no	waste	or	noise." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Dogland's	about	livin'	dogs,	sir,"	said	Francine.	"Folks	on	vacation</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p253"></a>don't	pay	to	look	at	no	dead	critters." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh?	What	are	dinosaurs	but	dead	critters?	What	are	all	museums	but monuments	to	the	dead,	lacking	only	the	presence	of	the	dead	themselves? </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	often	there's	the	token	representative	in	the	form	of	a	skeleton	or two	of	an	animal	or	an	Indian." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	sir,"	said	Francine.	"But	we	have	to	keep	going	if	we're	going	to finish	the	tour	before	dark." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	glanced	at	the	sky.	The	sun	was	low.	My	stomach	said	it	was	almost time	for	dinner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	dark	man	looked	at	the	sun.	"Ah,	yes.	The	transition	time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	beside	him	smiled	at	Francine.	"Then	I	shall	not	ask	whether you	plan	a	Catland	next.	There	are	almost	as	many	distinct	breeds,	you know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francine	shook	her	head.	"Ma'm,	you	can't	never	know	what	Mister	Nix'll be	thinkin'	on	next."	Before	either	visitor	could	speak	again,	she lifted	her	hand	toward	the	next	dog.	"This	is	Spots,	our	Dalmatian.	No one	knows	where	the	breed's	from	or	how	old	it	is.	Their	name	comes	from Dalmatia,	where	they	were	first	known." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	dark	couple	looked	down	the	walk.	A	pale	man	strode	toward	us.	He wore	a	white	cotton	suit	that	glistened	in	the	late	afternoon	light,	and the	set	of	his	jaw	said	that	his	days	were	always	wonderful.	Most	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p254"></a>tourists,	including	the	old	woman	in	the	Bermuda	shorts,	smiled	at	the sight	of	him,	and	so	did	I.	Cal	and	Victor's	glance	was	almost	reverential. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	dark	couple	nodded	curtly	to	him	and	returned	their	attention	to Francine,	who	was	saying,	"Dalmatians	were	known	for	running	alongside horse-drawn	vehicles.	That's	how	they	came	to	be	associated	with	fire engines.	The	breed's	got	many	nicknames,	including	the	plum-pudding	dog and	spotted	Dick." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Spotted	dick,"	Jordy	whispered,	and	we	ran	ten	or	twenty	feet	away, giggling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind	us,	Francine	told	the	blond	man,	"You're	welcome	to	join	this tour,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	answered,	"Thank	you,	but	I'm	used	to	making	my	own	way."	I	looked back.	His	voice	had	no	accent	in	this	land	where	everyone	spoke	like	a Northerner,	a	Southerner,	or	a	foreigner.	His	voice	might	have	been	mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	called,	"So,	you	two	want	to	help	or	not?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned.	Seth	approached	us	with	a	heavy-laden	wheelbarrow.	A	small	tin pot	was	stuck	into	the	dog	food	like	a	giant's	medicine-spoon.	While Jordy	and	I	had	dallied,	Seth	and	James	had	begun	their	way	around	the ring	of	pens.	I	saw	James	across	the	circle,	slopping	dog	food	onto	the cement	run	in	front	of	Bambi,	who	wagged	her	coiled	tail	as	she	buried her	nose	in	the	food. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p255"></a>I	looked	back.	The	tourists	had	moved	on.	The	pale	man	was	not	with them.	If	he	had	walked	quickly,	he	might	be	on	the	far	side	of	the circle,	hidden	by	trees	and	bushes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah!"	said	Jordy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	returned	his	grin.	"Yeah!"	We	ran	to	join	Seth,	then	followed	him	as he	opened	each	dog's	gate	to	slap	food	onto	its	run.	Jordy	and	I	laughed at	how	happy	the	dogs	were	to	see	us,	and	we	laughed	again	when	Seth	had to	hose	down	the	Great	Dane's	dog	pen	before	he	could	put	food	in	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	the	feeding	was	done,	I	wanted	to	help	hose	down	pens	in	the	final cleaning	of	the	day,	but	I	heard	Ma	call	Jordy	and	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bye,	Seth!	Bye,	James!"	I	yelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bye,	now!"	called	Jordy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bye,	y'all,"	James	answered	as	Seth	shook	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handyman	was	waiting	behind	the	kitchen	with	Ma	when	we	arrived.	"Hey, boy,"	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey,	Daddy,"	Jordy	said.	"Guess	what?	A	nigger	squirted	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handyman	glanced	at	Ma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	laughed.	"It	were	pretty	funny,	Daddy.	He	squirted	Chris,	too,	but Chris	run	faster'n	me.	You	should'a	seen	him	go,	Daddy.	Dang,	it	were funny!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handyman	shook	his	head.	"I'm	glad	they're	amusin'	you,	boy.	C'mon.	It's</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p256"></a>time	to	get	on	home,	have	your	Momma	cook	up	some	food." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She's	a	hard	worker,"	Ma	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handyman	made	a	soft	grunt	of	acknowledgment.	"We	best	be	goin'." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	at	me.	"Chris,	you'd	better	go	wash.	Dinner'll	be	ready	soon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Dinner?"	said	Jordy.	"You	ain't	had	dinner,	and	it's	nigh	on	suppertime already?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	what	we	mean,"	Ma	said.	"What	you	call	dinner,	we	call	lunch, and	what	we	call	dinner,	you	call	supper." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Dang,"	said	Jordy.	"That's	a	funny	way	to	do	things." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yankees,"	said	Handyman,	and	he	and	Ma	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	waved	and	ran	back	to	our	house.	When	I'd	finished	in	the	bathroom,	I charged	up	the	path	toward	the	kitchen.	The	pale	man	in	the	white	suit stood	by	the	Doggy	Salon,	watching	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Christopher,"	he	said,	and	I	stopped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We're	not	s'posed	to	talk	to	strangers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	smiled.	"I'm	no	stranger	to	anyone."	He	looked	over;	Little	Bit	was leading	Digger	from	the	house	to	the	kitchen.	"I'm	at	home	everywhere." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	sir,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	looked	at	us	and	kept	walking.	I	wondered	if	she	would	tell, then	decided	that	there	was	nothing	for	her	to	tell.	I	was	talking	to	a tourist.	Pa	said	we	were	to	be	polite	to	tourists. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p257"></a>"You	don't	know	the	meaning	of	your	name,"	the	man	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Christ-bearer.	One	who	carries	Jesus	Christ	in	his	heart." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh."	I	grinned.	Ma	and	both	Grandmas	would	like	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Names	do	not	define	you,	Christ-bearer.	Some	people	try	to	live	up	to their	names,	some	try	to	live	down	to	them,	some	never	know	that	their names	are	anything	more	than	a	sound	that	draws	them.	Do	you	love Christ,	Christopher?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	recognized	a	trick	question.	Jesus	was	a	tall	man	with	long	blond	hair who	wore	a	white	bathrobe	and	flip-flops.	He	liked	children	and	sheep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	you	said	you	loved	somebody,	people	would	laugh	at	you	and	you'd blush.	"I	love	Ma,	Grandma	and	Grandpa,	Grandma	Tess,	and	God." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Christ	was	also	God.	The	pale	man	saw	how	clever	I	had	been,	and	he laughed.	"Do	you	believe	in	Christ,	Christ-lover?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Christ-lover	sounded	like	nigger-lover,	though	he	said	it	nicely.	I	said carefully,	"Yes,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	Santa	Claus?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	Superman?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	another	trick	question,	yet	he	smiled.	I	had	seen	pictures	of Superman	in	comic	books.	I	nodded	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p258"></a>"Who's	stronger,	Superman	or	Jesus?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	laughed.	"I	wonder	that	myself." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How'd	you	know	my	name?"	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Names	are	easy	to	know.	Is	there	anything	you	want?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	Fort	Apache	play	set." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	have	a	Fort	Apache	play	set." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"With	two,	I	could	put	'em	together	an'	make	a	great	big	fort,	an'	a whole	bunch	of	Indians	could	attack." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah.	It's	good	to	know	what	you	want.	What	would	you	do	if	you	ruled	the whole	world?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'd	give	everybody	everything	they	want,"	I	said.	"Then	I'd	have	a	big war." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	are	wise	beyond	your	years."	He	looked	up.	I	followed	his	gaze.	Ma had	stepped	out	from	the	kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come,"	said	the	pale	man.	"I'll	walk	with	you	a	ways." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Does	everyone	in	your	family	believe	in	Christ?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wondering	if	he	was	a	preacher,	I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your	mother?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p259"></a>"Your	sister?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your	brother?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	prayed	whenever	we	prayed.	"Yes,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your	father?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ye--"	I	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	pale	man	did	not	notice	that	I	stopped.	He	smiled	at	Ma	as	we approached	the	restaurant.	"Mrs.	Nix.	You	have	a	very	wise	son." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	from	me	to	him.	"Yes.	Sometimes	a	little	too	wise	for	his	own good." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	knows	a	great	deal	about	your	dogs,	among	other	things." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	laughed.	"Were	you	showing	off,	Christopher?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	ma'm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	asked	the	pale	man,	"Are	you	local?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Everywhere	I	go.	Call	me	Nick.	Nick	Lumiere,	at	your	service."	He	held out	his	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	took	it.	"How	do	you	do?	I'm	Susan	Nix." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes.	I	know	your	neighbors	well.	Mrs.	DeLyon	and	the	Reverend	Shale." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They're	good	people.	Everyone	here	is." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	Reverend	sometimes,	ah,	wanders	from	his	establishment.	He	hasn't bothered	you,	I	trust?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p260"></a>"Oh,	no,"	Ma	said	quickly.	"I'm	not	worried	about	him.	You	can	tell	he means	well." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Lumiere	smiled.	"Mrs.	DeLyon	does	not	wander.	I	understand	she's been	especially	friendly	to	your	family,	to	you,	to	your	husband." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	frowned,	then	laughed.	"Oh,	my,	yes.	I	don't	know	how	we	would've gotten	by	without	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Perhaps	I	may	be	able	to	help	you,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	nodded.	"If	there's	anything	you	need,	call	on	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah,	I'm	afraid--"	Ma	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	didn't	catch	what	you	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,"	said	Mr.	Lumiere,	"I'm	not	the	law;	I'm	a	lawyer,	which	gives	me advantages	in	any	company.	I	assure	you,	there's	nothing	I	don't	know about	a	contract." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Artie	Drake	recommended	someone	for	the	filing	we've	had	to	do,"	Ma said.	"My	husband's	happy	with	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Artie	Drake	wouldn't	recommend	me,"	said	Mr.	Lumiere.	"But	he	can't	say I've	been	less	than	honest	in	my	dealings	with	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh!	I	didn't	mean	to	suggest--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	know	you	didn't,"	said	Mr.	Lumiere.	"I	should	leave	you	to	your</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p261"></a>dinner.	Ethorne's	your	cook." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Some	people	fear	a	colored	cook	might	spit	in	their	food	or	worse,	to take	some	small	revenge	on	the	white	race." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yuck!"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	Ethorne	isn't	one	of	those,	of	course,"	said	Mr.	Lumiere.	"I	trust you'll	have	a	good	meal." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank	you."	Ma	narrowed	her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good	day,"	he	told	her.	Then	he	grinned	at	me.	"Go	for	what	you	want, Christopher.	Don't	let	anything	stand	in	your	way.	That's	the	path	to happiness." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	Ma	took	my	hand	as	if	I	was	a	baby,	and	we	watched	Mr.	Lumiere stroll	away.	His	white	suit	caught	the	light	of	the	setting	sun	and shimmered	like	molten	gold.	Then	he	stepped	around	the	corner	of	the restaurant,	and	I	shook	my	hand	free,	saying,	"I'm	four	an' </p>
<p class="calibre1">three-quarters,	Ma."	She	laughed,	and	we	went	into	the	kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	and	Ethorne	bustled	within	a	world	of	heat	and	steam	that smelled	of	soap	and	the	satisfaction	of	hunger.	They	glanced	at	us	as	Ma pulled	me	through	the	swinging	doors	into	the	front	room.	Mr.	Shale said,	"Hello	there,	young	Christopher.	I	closed	the	hamburger	stand	a little	early	to	share	this	joyous	day	with	your	family,	and	to	bring	you</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p262"></a>a	present." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	sat	at	a	small	table	by	a	window	with	a	Bible	before	him	and	a cardboard	box	beside	him.	I	felt	everyone	looking	at	me	--	Pa	behind	the counter,	Jordy,	Handyman,	and	Lurleen	in	front	of	it,	Francine	and	Cal at	one	table,	Little	Bit	and	Digger	at	another,	and	people	I	did	not know	at	others	--	but	I	did	not	have	time	to	be	embarrassed.	The	promise of	a	present	drew	me	toward	the	box	as	Mr.	Shale	reached	in	with	hands that	were	brown	and	gnarled	like	the	roots	of	the	Heart	Tree.	Something struggled,	then	mewed	in	fear	and	fury	as	he	caught	it.	He	lifted	out	a small	grey	and	black-striped	kitten. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ooh,"	said	Little	Bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	a	darling	kitty,"	said	Ma,	and	then	she	glanced	at	Pa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mine?"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handyman	laughed.	"Ought	to	have	a	mouser	bigger'n	a	mouse." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Shale	said,	"The	lord	brought	him	to	my	doorstep,	safely	past	gators and	boars	who	would've	swallowed	him	like	Jonah.	Maybe	one	did	swallow him	and	cast	him	up	here,	safe	in	the	hands	of	those	who'll	preserve	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Maybe	not,"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Or	maybe	not,"	Mr.	Shale	acknowledged.	His	cheeks	were	speckled	with white	day-old	whiskers	that	rippled	as	he	laughed.	He	held	the	kitten toward	me.	"Take	him.	If	it's	all	right	with	your	folks." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p263"></a>I	reached	out.	"Gently,"	Mr.	Shale	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	kitten	swatted	my	finger,	drawing	blood.	"Ow!"	I	said.	As	Ma	hurried over	to	me,	Mr.	Shale	said,	"He's	just	reminding	you	he's	got	a	mind	of his	own.	You	have	to	show	him	you'll	be	nice." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	right."	I	took	the	kitten	into	my	cupped	hands.	He	looked	up	at	me as	I	stroked	his	forehead.	When	he	lapped	at	my	cut	finger	with	his rough	tongue,	I	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ain't	that	sweet?"	said	Lurleen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	you	goin'	to	name	him?"	asked	Jordy.	"Tom?	We	got	a	Elvis	and	a Fabian.	You	could	name	him	Troy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tiger,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Isn't	orange,"	Pa	said.	Ma	was	watching	him.	He	shrugged.	"I	see	how much	say	I've	got	in	this." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handyman	grinned.	"Ain't	that	the	way	of	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	held	out	her	hands.	I	twisted	away	from	her	and	said,	"No. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiger's	mine." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Shale	laughed.	"Thought	that	swipe	might've	shown	you	he's	not	a toy.	Keeping	a	live	thing	is	a	grave	responsibility.	That's	what	it means,	for	something	to	be	yours.	You	have	to	care	for	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"You'll	like	cleaning	his	box." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p264"></a>Ma	said,	"Chris	is	a	little	young--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I	wouldn't	call	scooping	cat	turds	a	great	challenge	for	a	boy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	clean	his	box,"	said	Little	Bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No!"	I	said.	"I	will." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	laughed.	"Wouldn't've	called	it	a	privilege,	either." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiger	twisted	in	my	hands.	I	started	to	put	him	back	in	the	cardboard box,	but	Digger	patted	Tiger's	head,	and	he	began	purring	a	loud,	deep note.	I	let	Little	Bit	pet	him,	too,	and	she	smiled	at	Tiger	and	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Y'know,"	Handyman	said,	"maybe	we	ought	to	eat	here	t'night.	We	both had	a	long	day." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lurleen	nodded,	smiling	down	at	Handyman's	scalp,	as	Jordy	said,	"All right!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Did	I	mention	the	employee	discount?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Employee	discount?"	said	Cal,	and	we	all	looked	at	the	table	he	shared with	Francine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francine	began,	"Now,	Cal--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"Francine	gets	it,	too."	He	sounded	less	happy	than	he	had been	a	minute	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank	you,	Mist'	Nix,"	Francine	murmured. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothing	to	thank	me	for,"	Pa	said.	"It	comes	with	the	job." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handyman	claimed	an	empty	table.	"Then	I	reckon	we	better	take	advantage</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p265"></a>of	Lurleen's	benefits.	What've	the	kitchen	niggers	cooked	up?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ethorne,"	Pa	said,	"has	cooked	up	pork	chops,	mashed	potatoes,	sausage gravy,	and	green	beans	with	bacon.	That	to	your	liking?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	biscuits."	Mr.	Shale	lifted	one	to	illustrate.	"The	lightest	I've ever	seen." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They're	good,"	Little	Bit	said,	and	I	noticed	that	she	and	Digger	had dirty	plates	in	front	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sounds	fine,"	said	Handyman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Me	an'	Jordy'll	eat	together,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"May	Jordy	and	I	eat	together?"	said	Ma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shoot,"	said	Handyman,	"once	you've	seen	the	young'uns	eat	together, you	won't	ask	to	eat	with	'em,	Mis'	Nix." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	laughed	hard,	so	I	did,	too.	Ma	said,	"Christopher." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"May	Jordy	and	I	eat	together?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	you	may." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	Tiger?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	smiled.	"We'll	fix	something	for	him."	She	glanced	at	Lurleen.	"Sit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'll	take	your	order." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lurleen	nodded	as	if	she'd	been	hit.	"Yes'm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	admired	my	cat,	even	Cal,	who	said	as	he	returned	to	his	table, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	see	you	popped	a	button,	boy.	You	ought	to	take	better	care	o'	your</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p266"></a>clothes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	at	me.	"Oh,	Chris.	How'd	you	do	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	need	to	be	careful	with	what	you're	wearing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	Cal	said,	"You	listen	to	your	mama,	boy.	You	want	to	be	a	nice young	man." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francine	said,	"Cal." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	don't	he?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Yes,	he	does,	and	he	will	be." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	right	then,"	Cal	said	with	satisfaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	Jordy	and	I	had	been	convinced	that	Tiger	should	be	allowed	to sleep,	we	began	to	play	a	game	that	involved	sliding	sugar	packets across	a	Formica	tabletop.	When	Ma	brought	our	dinner,	she	put	a	saucer with	a	scrambled	egg	into	Tiger's	box	and	said,	"I	suppose	you	two didn't	even	notice	the	gorgeous	sunset." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	Ma,"	I	said,	and	giggled	because	Jordy	did.	Sunsets	were	for	girls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	long,	dark	convertible	turned	into	the	drive.	Its	lights	struck	the front	window,	turning	the	world	into	a	fireburst,	then	snapped	off, turning	it	into	nothing	at	all.	Mr.	Shale	blinked,	then	smiled	when Gwenny	Drake	came	through	the	door.	I	did,	too.	Mr.	Shale's	smile disappeared	when	a	pale,	dark-haired	boy	in	a	Levi	jacket	stopped	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p267"></a>door	frame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Y'all	still	open?"	the	boy	asked	politely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	at	the	clock.	"Sure.	Come	in,	have	a	seat." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank	you,"	said	the	boy,	and	he	stepped	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your	date?"	Pa	asked	Gwenny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh."	She	covered	her	mouth	and	laughed.	"A	friend.	Johnny	Tepes,	this is	Mr.	Nix,	and	that's	Mrs.	Nix--"	Ma	waved	as	she	carried	dishes	into the	kitchen.	"--and	that's	my	boyfriend,	Christopher,	and	my	best girlfriend,	Little	Bit,	and	my	best	little	buddy,	Digger." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	blushed	and	looked	down.	Jordy	kicked	my	leg	with	a	tennis	shoe.	"Your girlfriend?"	he	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wow.	She's	pretty." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	d'you	do."	Johnny	Tepes	stood	by	the	cash	register,	surveying	the room.	Cal	and	Francine	ignored	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fine,"	I	mumbled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fine,"	said	Little	Bit,	walking	up	to	Johnny	with	Digger's	hand	in	her own.	"Gwen's	nice." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	know,"	said	Johnny,	smiling	at	Little	Bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	laughed.	"My	daughter's	just	a	little	bit	protective.	There's	a	clean table	in	the	corner." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p268"></a>"Thank	you."	Johnny	began	to	cross	toward	it,	then	paused.	"Ethorne's cooking	for	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah.	He	remembers	how	I	like	my	food." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh."	Ma	frowned,	then	smiled.	"All	right.	Sure.	Do	you	know	what	you'd like?	Or	does	Ethorne	know	that,	too?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	glanced	at	Gwenny.	She	said,	"A	rebel	burger,	fries,	and	a	Coke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	nodded.	"Likewise.	Water	instead	of	Coke,	please." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Got	it."	Ma	headed	into	the	kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gwenny	tucked	her	menu	between	the	napkin	dispenser	and	the	ketchup, then	looked	around	and	smiled.	"Francy!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francine	had	been	staring	into	the	window,	perhaps	at	the	gathering night,	perhaps	at	Cal's	reflection	in	the	glass.	"Oh,	Gwenny.	Hi!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal	pursed	his	lips	and	said	in	falsetto,	"Oh,	Gwenny,	hi!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	and	I	laughed.	Francine	swatted	the	air	before	Cal's	nose,	saying, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	you,"	then	turning	back	to	Gwenny.	"You	know	Cal,	don't	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gwen	nodded.	"You	caught	the	long	bomb	in	the	second	quarter	of	the Trenton	game	last	fall." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	grinned.	"Why,	yes'm,	that	was	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This	is	Johnny,"	Gwenny	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hi,"	said	Francine.	"I	keep	thinking	we	met,	but	I	must've	just	seen</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p269"></a>you	around." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No	doubt,"	said	Johnny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where	around?"	said	Cal	to	Francine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Around.	You	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No."	Cal	kept	smiling.	"I	don't	know.	You	tell	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francine	glanced	at	Johnny	and	back	at	Cal.	"Maybe	at	the	Roadhouse	when you	took	me	the	other	night?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	shrugged	with	a	smile.	"I'm	often	at	the	Roadhouse." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal	asked	Francine,	"So,	you	givin'	boys	the	eye	when	I	step	outside?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	Cal--"	she	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	she	has,"	Johnny	said	calmly,	"I	haven't	been	lucky	enough	to	get that	eye." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She's	my	wife,	you	know,"	Cal	said.	"I'd	like	to	know	what	makes	you think--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Here	you	go!"	Ma	announced,	bringing	a	tray	of	food	toward	Francine	and Johnny.	Setting	a	plate	before	Johnny,	she	said,	"Very	rare,	no	onions or	garlic,	right?"	Johnny	nodded.	Ma	looked	at	me.	"What's	the	show,	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bigeyes?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	looked	at	me.	I	pointed	at	the	metal	cannister	in	front	of Francine.	"Can	I	have	a	milk	shake	too?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well--"	She	glanced	up	as	a	set	of	headlights	hesitated	on	the	highway, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p270"></a>then	came	slowly	down	the	driveway	toward	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Huh?"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind	the	counter,	Pa	set	down	his	cowboy	book.	"My.	Busy	day." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hope	it	keeps	up."	Handyman	stood.	"Dinner	was	all	right,	but	I	sure don't	see	why	anyone	thinks	that	nigger	cooks	so	good." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Maybe	your	stomach's	upset,"	Lurleen	said.	"It	was	just	fine.	Jordy!	Go wash	up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes'm,"	he	said,	sliding	out	of	his	chair	with	a	last	peek	into	Tiger's box.	The	kitten	had	eaten	most	of	the	egg	and	gone	to	sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	new	arrival	parked.	Little	Bit	stared	at	it,	so	I	did,	too.	In	the dark	parking	lot,	a	man	got	out	from	behind	the	driver's	seat.	I	could see	several	other	people	inside	the	car,	but	its	ceiling	light	did	not come	on,	so	the	people	stayed	shadows.	Light	from	the	restaurant	surfed over	the	car's	new	paint. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	stopped	at	the	front	door	and	knocked.	Pa	frowned,	then	waved his	arm.	"C'mon	on	in!	We're	still	serving!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	opened,	and	a	man	stood	in	the	entryway	in	a	business	suit	as dark	as	his	skin.	He	said	softly,	"Excuse	me,	sir.	Do	you	have	a	colored rest	room?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	studied	him	for	a	long	instant,	then	said,	"Yep.	Two.	The	men's	is colored	blue,	and	the	women's	is	colored	pink." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p271"></a>The	visitor's	gaze	flickered	a	fraction.	I	had	not	seen	that	he	was	not meeting	anyone's	eyes,	until	he	looked	at	Pa's.	Pa	pointed	at	the	door on	the	far	side	of	the	room.	"They're	on	the	side	of	the	building, through	there." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank	you."	The	visitor	stepped	back	into	the	night.	In	the	silence,	we all	heard	him	say,	"It's	all	right,"	and	a	woman	with	two	small	girls got	out	of	the	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	was	looking	at	Pa.	He	said,	"What,	is	the	women's	green?	I	can't remember	these	things." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	black	family	hesitated	at	the	front	door.	The	woman	wore	a	nice dress,	as	did	the	girls,	who	wore	clothes	cleaner	and	newer	than	mine	or Jordy's,	as	though	they	had	dressed	for	church	or	a	family	reunion.	The man	said,	"Hurry	up,	now,"	and	walked	his	family	through	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	Tepes	looked	away	and	said,	"Good	burger,"	to	Gwenny,	at	the	same time	that	Francine	said,	"We	best	be	goin',"	to	Cal,	who	answered, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's	the	hurry?	Ain't	but	one	openin'	day.	Don't	you	want	to	stay till	closin'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	family	of	tourists	went	to	the	cash	register	and	paid	their	bill.	Pa said,	"Hope	you'll	stop	in	the	next	time	you're	by."	The	parents	nodded curtly	and	left	without	speaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	black	man	was	the	first	to	return	from	the	restrooms.	He	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p272"></a>"Thank	you,"	again	to	Pa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"That's	what	they're	there	for." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	smiled	a	bit.	"Do	you	fix	take-out	food?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"We	fix	take-out	food	and	take-in	food.	I	figure	once	you	buy it,	you	can	take	it	where	you	please."	He	gestured	toward	a	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We're	staying	open	a	little	late	tonight,	if	you	folks	would	like	to sit	down.	It's	our	first	official	day	of	business." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	looked	at	the	woman	and	girls	as	they	came	into	the	room.	"I--</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thank	you.	Yes.	We	would.	We	had	car	trouble	this	afternoon,	and	we'd hoped	to	be	home	by	now--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	haven't	eaten?"	Ma	said.	"These	children	must	be	starving." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	think	they	are,"	said	the	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	ma'am,	we	surely	are,"	said	the	younger	girl	with	a	solemn	nod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,"	said	Ma.	"We'll	have	to	do	something	about	that,	won't	we?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handyman	shook	his	head	once,	then	said,	"Bye,"	and	walked	out.	Lurleen and	Jordy	followed	him.	I	waved	at	Jordy.	Lurleen	tugged	his	arm	before he	could	wave	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal	said,	"I	seen	enough,"	and	he	and	Francine	left	after	she	told	me	to take	good	care	of	my	Tiger.	Johnny	and	Gwenny	stayed	in	the	corner, whispering	as	they	ate.	The	black	family	ate	their	dinner	and	left.	Pa said	something	about	the	man	ordering	the	most	expensive	meal	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p273"></a>menu.	Ma	did	not	respond	to	that.	After	Johnny	and	Gwenny	had	gone	and Pa	had	turned	the	"open"	sign	around,	he	went	to	the	cash	register	to count	the	day's	receipts,	and	Ma	took	Digger	and	Little	Bit	back	to	the house	since	it	was	past	their	bedtimes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stood	by	the	window,	holding	Tiger	and	looking	out	into	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne,	mopping	the	floor,	came	up	to	me	and	said,	"What	you	see	out there,	Christopher?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothin'." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	added,	"'Cept	that	man	on	the	road." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh?	What's	he	look	like	to	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Like	you,	Ethorne.	Only	tall.	An'	he's	got	a	black	coat	an'	a	high black	hat." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	a	Negro?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's	he	doin'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just	dancing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	nodded.	We	stood	there,	looking	out	into	the	moonlight.	The dancing	man	waved	and	went	into	the	trees.	I	waved	back.	Ethorne	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	seen	him	go?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p274"></a>"Well.	It's	been	a	long,	long	day,	Mast'	Chris.	You	best	do	like	your kittycat	and	get	you	some	sleep." </p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h2 title="Chapter Seven, Learning to Swim" id="calibre_toc_10" class="calibre4">Chapter	Seven</h2>
<h3 class="sigilnotintoc">Learning	to	Swim</h3>

<p class="calibre1">We	gave	Tiger	swimming	lessons	in	our	plastic	wading	pool.	I	taught	the kitten	the	way	Pa	taught	me:	I	threw	him	into	water	where	he	could	not stand,	and	I	watched,	ready	to	grab	him	if	he	went	under.	Tiger	did	not thrash	desperately	like	me.	He	merely	paddled	urgently	for	the	edge	of the	plastic	pool	with	his	head	high	and	his	thin	legs	churning.	Little Bit	said,	"Dog	paddle,"	and	we	all	laughed.	"Tiger	paddle,"	I	said,	and we	all	laughed	some	more,	even	Jordy.	That	was	probably	when	Ma	noticed the	kitten	swimming	lessons	and	stopped	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	swimming	lessons	happened	in	two	places.	When	Pa	took	us,	we	went	to Hawkins	Springs	behind	Mrs.	DeLyons'	Fountain	of	Youth	Motor	Hotel.	When Ma	took	us,	we	drove	to	Mermaid	Springs	State	Park,	where	we	would sometimes	meet	Mr.	Drake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	liked	Mermaid	Springs	better	because	I	felt	safe	there.	Ma	could	not swim,	so	she	never	made	me	jump	off	a	dock	into	deep	water,	and	she always	insisted	that	I	wear	an	orange	styrofoam	cylinder	on	my	back	like a	skindiver	or	spaceman.	Ma	usually	sat	on	a	towel	on	the	grass	near	the beach,	reading	a	magazine	or	a	book	while	tanning	her	legs.	Every	now</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p275"></a>and	then	she	would	call	to	us	not	to	go	too	far	or	not	to	splash	each other.	When	she	wore	her	one-piece	red	swimming	suit,	she	would	come	in up	to	her	waist,	then	lower	herself	to	her	shoulders,	being	careful	not to	get	her	hair	wet.	On	the	rarest	occasions,	she	would	wear	a	swimming cap	and	float	on	her	back	in	the	shallow	water.	Often	she	stayed	in	her shorts	and	shirt,	adding	sunglasses	and	removing	shoes	as	her	concession to	summer	and	the	beach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mermaid	Springs	had	several	floating	docks	that	enclosed	a	shallow	area for	little	kids,	and	concrete	and	tile	changing	rooms	with	wooden benches	and	flush	toilets,	and	a	concession	stand	that	sold	hot	dogs	and soda	pop	and	popsicles,	and	a	walking	bridge	that	arched	over	a	narrow neck	of	land	where	the	springs	flowed	into	a	broad	area	of	weeds	and sawgrass	on	its	way	to	the	river.	There	were	always	a	lot	of	people	at the	state	park,	little	kids	like	us,	big	kids	like	Gwenny	Drake,	and adults	like	Ma	and	Mr.	Drake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Besides	the	orange	styrofoam	cylinder	on	my	back,	I	often	swam	with	a giant	red	plastic	baseball	bat	that	I	clutched	like	a	shipwrecked	sailor clinging	to	a	spar.	Once,	when	neither	Pa	nor	Mr.	Drake	were	along,	I was	hanging	onto	the	bat	and	swimming	in	the	shallows	by	the	walking bridge.	Little	kids	played	on	both	sides	of	the	neck	of	land,	and	bigger kids	swam	back	and	forth.	I	decided	to	swim	to	the	far	side,	but	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p276"></a>current	caught	the	plastic	bat	and	began	pulling	me	toward	the	bridge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	screamed.	I	can't	remember	now	whether	I	was	afraid	that	I	would drown,	or	that	I	would	lose	the	red	bat,	or	that	something	among	the weeds	and	lillypads	would	get	me.	Maybe	I	only	knew	that	something stronger	than	me	was	taking	me	someplace	I	did	not	want	to	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kids	and	adults	stared	at	me.	I	don't	know	if	the	lifeguard	was	far away,	or	if	there	was	no	lifeguard	on	duty	that	day.	All	I	know	is	that Ma,	fully	dressed,	ran	into	the	water	and	grabbed	me	before	the	current drew	me	under	the	bridge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	an	early	lesson	about	appearances	at	Mermaid	Springs.	The	first time	I	went	into	the	enclosed	swimming	area,	I	saw	a	man	several	yards from	shore	in	water	up	to	his	neck.	I	looked	at	him,	wondering	if	there was	a	drop-off	and	trying	to	remember	if	undertows	were	only	something to	worry	about	in	the	ocean.	The	man	saw	me	and	smiled	and	rose,	higher and	higher	as	water	cascaded	from	his	skin	until	he	stood	knee-deep	in what	had	clearly	been	shallow	water	all	along,	yet	had	been	mysterious depths	until	he	stood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mermaid	Springs	was	named	for	manatees.	Ma	read	about	them	from plastic-covered	papers	tacked	to	a	rough,	outdoor	sign	board	that	stood under	its	own	small	roof.	"See?"	Ma	said,	pointing	at	a	drawing	of something	that	looked	like	a	cross	between	a	pig	and	a	catfish.	"That's</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p277"></a>a	manatee.	Sometimes	they	come	into	the	springs,	but	I	don't	see	any	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Will	they	get	us?"	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	pointed	at	a	wire	fence	in	the	water	around	the	swimming	area.	"They can't	get	through	that.	Even	if	they	could,	they	wouldn't	hurt	anyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	says	they	don't	have	any	natural	enemies.	They're	mammals.	Do	you remember	what	mammals	are?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Like	us,"	Little	Bit	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Air	breathers,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	Latin	name's	Trichechus	manatus.	That's	pretty	hard	to	say,	huh? </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	are	three	kinds	of	tricky-chee-dee."	She	laughed	as	she	stumbled over	the	name,	so	we	laughed,	too.	"Trichechus	manatus	is	found	from central	Florida	to	northern	South	America.	That's	the	manatee	that	lives in	the	river	here.	There's	also	Trickycus	inunguis	in	the	Amazon	river and	Trickycus	senegalensis	in	West	Africa.	Manatees	can	get	to	be	as	big as	fifteen	hundred	pounds.	That's	thirty	times	what	you	weigh,	Chris." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	lot,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	the	adults	range	in	length	from	eight	to	fifteen	feet.	They	mate, um,	we'll	skip	that.	The	mothers	have	one	baby	at	a	time,	like	humans	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can	we	see	a	baby?"	asked	Little	Bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	can	look	for	one,"	said	Ma.	"Manatees	eat	plants	in	slow	rivers	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p278"></a>along	the	coasts.	They	help	keep	the	waterways	clear	of	vegetation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They're	part	of	a	group	called	sea	cows,	who're	over	fifty	million	years old.	That's	a	lot	of	zeroes.	That's	before	there	were	people." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Dinosaurs?"	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	shrugged.	"Maybe.	People	used	to	hunt	sea	cows	for	meat,	for	their hides,	and	for	oil.	The	biggest	was	Stellar's	Sea	Cow,	which	grew	as long	as	twenty-four	feet.	It	was	hunted	to	extinction	thirty	years	after being	discovered	in	the	Bering	Sea	in	1741." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Stinkshun	means	there's	no	more,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	of	that	kind	of	sea	cow,	anyway."	Ma	kept	reading.	"Manatees	are	in danger	because	they	float	near	the	top	of	the	water,	and	people	in	motor boats	hit	them	with	their	propellers.	Some	of	them	are	scarred	on	their backs	from	being	hit	many	times.	Poor	things." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	not	fair,"	said	Little	Bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	people	have	to	use	the	river	too,"	Ma	said.	"You	like	riding	in boats,	don't	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Manatees	don't	see	well.	They	communicate	by	touching	their	muzzles together." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Like	a	kiss!"	Little	Bit	said,	laughing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	smiled.	"And	when	they're	alarmed,	they	make	a	chirping	sound.	Like</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p279"></a>squirrels,	maybe.	They	live	alone	or	in	families	of	up	to	fifteen	or twenty.	You	know	why	this	place	is	called	Mermaid	Springs?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uh	uh,"	Little	Bit	and	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"When	sailors	on	the	ocean	saw	sea	cows	swimming	far	away,	they	thought they	were	mermaids." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pointed	at	the	drawing	of	a	manatee.	"Don't	have	any	hair.	Or	arms." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	ruffled	my	crewcut.	"If	you'd	been	the	lookout,	you'd've	told	them these	were	sea	cows,	not	mermaids,	right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Right,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mercows,"	said	Mr.	Drake	behind	us.	"Moo.	Glub	glub	glub.	Moo." </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	all	laughed,	even	Ma,	who	said,	"Fancy	meeting	you	here.	Is	Gwenny along?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	she's	getting	too	old	to	be	escorted	by	a	senile,	decrepit	male like	her	Dad."	He	grinned.	"How're	things?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fine."	Ma	shrugged.	"But	I	don't	know	if	I'll	ever	get	used	to	the climate.	I	expected	the	heat	and	the	bugs.	I	never	thought	I'd	be fighting	mold	and	mustiness,	trying	to	keep	our	shoes	and	luggage	and belts	wiped	clean--"	She	brushed	her	hair	back	from	her	forehead	and laughed.	"Well.	I	came	here	to	leave	that	behind,	and	here	I	drag	it along	with	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	nodded.	"How	about	a	cold	Co-cola	to	help	you	forget?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p280"></a>"Okay!"	said	Little	Bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,"	said	Ma.	"That'd	be	nice." </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	we	all	had	Cokes.	I	drank	mine	to	the	last	drop,	though	it	did	not taste	like	grape	or	orange	or	anything	good.	Digger	and	I	made	sand castles	while	Ma	and	Mr.	Drake	sat	on	the	beach,	talking	about	concrete block	houses	and	girls	to	help	with	house	work	and	what	the	local schools	were	like	and	the	funny	things	that	children	did.	Ma	wore	her swimsuit	and	sunglasses	that	day,	and	Mr.	Drake,	in	green	swimming trunks	and	a	red	Hawaiian	shirt,	had	white	gunk	on	his	nose	like lifeguards	wore	(which	he	told	me	was	warpaint).	In	the	sunlight,	his hair	and	hers	were	the	same	color	as	Digger's	and	Little	Bit's,	which meant	they	were	the	same	color	as	mine.	As	Ma	spread	tanning	oil	on	her legs,	Mr.	Drake	smiled	and	said	it	was	a	glorious	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	no	Cokes	to	be	had	at	Hawkins	Springs,	or	flush	toilets	and tiled	changing	rooms,	or	young	lifeguards	with	white	grease	striped	down their	noses,	or	laughing	crowds,	or	signboards	about	the	history	of	the land	or	the	native	wildlife.	There	was	an	abandoned	wooden	dance	hall, and	the	overgrown	foundations	of	Fort	Hawkins,	and	the	springs	itself, an	eternal	frigid	bubbling	of	water	from	a	bowl	in	the	Earth	that	might have	been	thirty	feet	deep	and	thirty	feet	across.	A	simple	wooden platform	had	been	built	at	the	edge	of	the	shore	for	divers,	and	a	thick</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p281"></a>knotted	rope	hung	from	an	oak	for	those	who	wished	to	swing	out	over	the cool	boil	and	drop	into	its	heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ground	around	the	springs	was	steep	and	grassy,	roughly	terraced	by roots	and	a	few	boulders.	A	wide	swatch	of	saw	grass	under	glass-clear waters	bounded	the	side	of	the	boil	that	gushed	toward	the	Suwannee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps	twenty	yards	from	the	boil	was	a	steep	sandy	beach	and	a	gently sloping	sand-bottomed	swimming	area.	Beyond	that	lay	a	region	of	weeds, lily	pads,	dark	mud,	and	cypress	knees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes	we	rode	in	the	station	wagon	to	Hawkins	Springs,	but	when	the weather	was	warm	and	Pa	was	not	in	a	hurry,	we	walked	along	the	side	of the	road	and	past	the	Fountain	of	Youth	to	a	dirt	road	that	wound	back beside	the	motel	units	to	the	dance	hall,	an	old	rectangular	structure of	weathered	wood	that	had	windows	without	glass	or	screens	and entrances	without	doors.	For	decades,	people	had	come	to	dance,	drink, and	make	love	there,	moving	desperately	together	beneath	the	rafters	to the	beat	of	a	visiting	band.	Ma	and	Pa	probably	looked	at	the	building and	saw	the	ghosts	of	couples	who	passed	warm	evenings	beside	the springs.	To	me,	it	was	only	the	old	dancehall.	It	needed	a	saloon's swinging	doors	and	the	scars	of	gun	duels	to	acquire	romance	in	my	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	dancehall	overlooked	Hawkins	Springs	and	a	sliver	of	the	darker waters	of	the	Suwannee	that	flowed	past	the	spring's	mouth.	A	narrow</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p282"></a>dirt	path,	rutted	from	rains,	ran	in	front	of	the	dancehall	and	down	to the	sandy	beach.	We	would	change	into	our	swimsuits	in	the	shadows	of the	echoing	dancehall,	leaving	our	clothes	on	the	floor,	and	run	down	to the	water	with	our	towels	and	toys.	Pa	usually	dropped	his	shirt	and towel	in	the	sand	as	he	ran,	kicked	off	his	flipflops,	and	plunged	in, splashing	all	about	him	while	we	kids	giggled,	and	diving	under	water when	he	was	in	up	to	his	thighs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	raft	made	of	wooden	planks	and	metal	barrels	had	been	anchored	between the	beach	and	the	mouth	to	the	river.	Sometimes	Pa's	dive	would	carry him	under	the	raft,	and	he	would	rise	on	the	far	side	out	of	our	sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	we	could	worry,	he	would	return,	climbing	onto	the	raft,	then diving	toward	us,	or	merely	swimming	with	strong	overhead	strokes	back to	where	he	could	stand	and	ask	why	we	hadn't	gotten	in	the	water	yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	would	laugh,	and	sometimes	they'd	start	to	splash	each	other while	Digger,	giggling,	rocked	up	and	down,	slapping	the	water	and splashing	himself	more	than	anyone	else.	Sometimes	Pa	would	pick	us	up and	toss	us	out	into	the	water.	Little	Bit	would	shriek	in	delight,	but I	would	try	to	hide	my	dread.	I	hated	the	shock	of	being	swallowed	by cold	water,	the	pain	of	having	water	run	up	my	nose,	the	sight	of	a rippling	roof	of	water	above	me	that	might	recede	infinitely	as	I	sank further	and	further	until	I	was	a	corpse	at	the	bottom	of	the	sea, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p283"></a>drifting	forever	among	rippling	grasses,	sunken	galleons,	and	curious mermaids. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	rarely	saw	other	people	at	Hawkins	Spring.	When	we	did,	they	were usually	guests	of	the	motel	who	we'd	never	see	again.	If	Mrs.	DeLyon	was working	outside	or	by	the	office	window	when	we	passed,	she	and	Pa	would nod	or	wave.	We	almost	never	saw	her	at	the	springs,	but	once,	when	Pa was	diving	down	into	the	boil	to	touch	the	opening	where	water	gushed from	the	Earth,	the	opening	where	two	scuba	divers	had	entered	and	never returned,	I	saw	Little	Bit	looking	up	at	the	dancehall.	Mrs.	DeLyon stood	there,	watching	from	the	shadows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	waved	to	her,	and	so	did	Digger,	and	so	did	I.	She	laughed, said,	"I	have	better	things	to	do,"	then	walked	down	to	join	us.	Digger, Little	Bit,	and	I	sat	by	the	shore	where	Pa	had	told	us	to	stay	while	he swam.	As	Mrs.	DeLyon	removed	her	sunglasses,	Pa	shot	to	the	surface, shaking	his	head	like	a	seal.	He	looked	toward	us,	and	I	cannot	guess what	he	saw;	his	glasses	were	tucked	into	a	grassy	ledge	along	with	a translucent	plastic	box	that	held	a	white	bar	of	soap.	He	said,	"Hi, Maggie.	It's	invigorating." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,"	she	agreed.	"It	is." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	swam	to	the	shore	and	climbed	up	to	join	us.	His	tanned	biceps	worked smoothly	in	both	enterprises.	I	thought	of	my	thin	pale	arms	and	wished</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p284"></a>I	could	be	an	adult	instantly	by	one	supreme	effort	of	will.	Pa	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Taking	a	break?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	nodded.	"I	shouldn't	be." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Sometimes	you	have	to."	He	began	soaping	himself,	passing	the bar	over	the	hair	on	his	chest	and	stomach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shampoo	monster,"	Little	Bit	said,	and	Mrs.	DeLyon	covered	her	mouth	to hide	a	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Seems	to	me	I'm	not	the	only	one	who	needs	to	wash.	What	would your	Ma	say?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"I	don't	need	a	bath." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Queen	Elizabeth	the	First	took	a	bath	every	year,	whether	she needed	one	or	not." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	laughed.	"I	took	one	this	year!	I	took	one	this	year!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shook	his	head	and,	sudsing	his	legs	and	feet,	told	Mrs.	DeLyon,	"I think	our	first	mistake	is	teaching	our	children	to	reason." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	would	be	nice	if	we	could,"	Mrs.	DeLyon	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah.	That's	why	we	make	the	mistake	of	trying."	Pa	handed	the	soap	to Digger.	"Soap	all	over." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	nodded	and	followed	Pa's	example.	Pa	said,	"There's	nothing	like this	after	a	hot	day's	work."	He	stepped	to	the	bank	and	dove.	When	he came	up	again	in	the	center	of	the	springs,	he	treaded	water	lazily	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p285"></a>said,	"Care	to	join	us?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Some	other	time."	Mrs.	DeLyon	replaced	her	sunglasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	like	washing	in	the	springs	water,"	Little	Bit	said.	"It's	fun." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	nodded	at	her.	Pa	called,	"Meet	you	at	the	shallow	area!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	began	swimming	across	the	stretch	of	sawgrass	as	though	there	was	no chance	at	all	that	the	Creature	from	the	Black	Lagoon	lurked	there.	The rest	of	us	followed	along	the	shore,	stepping	carefully	across	a	creek that	trickled	from	beneath	the	dancehall	into	the	springs.	Then	Digger dropped	the	soap	into	Little	Bit's	hands	and	ran	into	the	water.	Pa caught	him,	swinging	him	high,	then	setting	him	back	in	shallow	water because	Digger	swam	fine	underwater	but	did	not	seem	to	understand	about swimming	on	the	surface. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	threw	the	soap	to	me.	I	dropped	it	on	the	sand.	"Stupid!"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're	stupid,"	Little	Bit	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	rubber,"	I	said,	"And	you're	glue,	and	what	you	say	bounces	off	me and	sticks	to	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	had	taught	me	that.	I	grinned	until	Little	Bit	spoiled	my	triumph. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Am	not.	You	are." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	think,"	Mrs.	DeLyon	said,	"you're	both	too	intelligent	for	this conversation." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	soap's	all	dirty,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p286"></a>"Is	there	a	remedy?"	asked	Mrs.	DeLyon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stuck	out	my	lower	lip,	immediately	retracted	it,	nodded,	and	carried the	soap	to	the	water	to	rinse	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That,"	said	Mrs.	DeLyon,	"is	all	there	is	to	being	a	hero." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	still	got	some	dirt	in	it,"	I	said	pointedly,	but	Little	Bit	had already	waded	out	to	jump	around	until	she	had	rinsed	herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	the	harder	half	of	being	a	hero,"	said	Mrs.	DeLyon.	"You	can never	make	things	the	same	as	they	were." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rubbed	my	chest	with	the	soap	with	its	embedded	bits	of	sand.	"Scratches." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Makes	you	tough,"	Mrs.	DeLyon	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Makes	you	more	careful	about	catching	what	you're	thrown,"	Pa	said behind	me.	I	had	not	realized	he	was	listening.	He	patted	the	bristles of	my	crewcut,	and	I	relaxed.	He	asked	Mrs.	DeLyon,	"You	do	all	right with	kids.	Any	of	your	own?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sometimes	I	serve	as	a	teacher." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"I	don't	know	why	our	society	doesn't	value	teachers	more." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	smiled.	"I've	quit	trying	to	understand	the	why	of societies.	It's	enough	to	know	the	what	and	the	how." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	sat	beside	her.	"I'd	settle	for	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed.	"Would	you?	I	think	you	understand	much	of	what	the	South is,	yet	you	do	not	settle	for	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p287"></a>"Don't	tell	me	you're	going	to	get	after	me	for	serving	colored	people, too?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who's	gotten	after	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shrugged.	"A	few	of	Dogland's	shareholders.	And	I've	seen	that	we don't	get	much	business	from	local	whites." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tourist	attractions	don't	get	a	lot	of	local	business." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Restaurant	should	get	some.	And	we	do.	From	local	colored	people." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	bothers	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hell,	no.	They're	good	people.	Their	money's	green,	and	they	generally seem	glad	to	be	spending	it	at	our	place.	Which	is	more	than	I	can	say for	some	white	tourists.	Too	many	people	aren't	happy	unless	they're miserable." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Watching	Lurleen	Greenleaf	is	the	damndest	thing.	You	can	tell	she likes	Mayella,	which	makes	sense	since	Mayella's	the	only	other	Southern woman	there.	They'll	sit	in	the	kitchen	smoking	cigarettes	and	talking about	men	until	I	have	to	yell	at	them	to	pretend	I'm	paying	them	to	do something.	But	when	Lurleen's	out	front,	she	won't	wait	on	Negroes,	and Mayella	might	as	well	be	a	stranger.	A	stranger	of	no	consequence." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Does	Mayella	mind?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	at	her,	then	said,	"You	know,	I	can't	tell." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p288"></a>"Do	you	mind?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Isn't	my	place	to	mind." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mmm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	near	them,	digging	in	the	sand	with	a	sun-bleached	stick.	Pa called,	"Don't	you	want	to	rinse	that	soap	off?"	I	shrugged.	The	drying soap	itched,	but	their	conversation	was	interesting,	and	I	was	in	no hurry	to	go	in	the	water	while	Pa	was	watching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	said,	"Artie	says	once	you	understand	the	nature	of	defeated	nations, you	understand	the	South.	And	Ireland	and	Germany	and	a	few	other	places as	well.	Folks	look	for	scapegoats.	Here,	it's	the	black	man.	But	why does	one	person's	pride	have	to	come	at	the	expense	of	another's?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	not	unusual	to	despise	those	we've	wronged." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"I	hate	people." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	laughed	so	hard	that	Digger	and	Little	Bit	quit	splashing	to glance	at	her.	She	said,	"You're	one	of	the	most	sociable	men	I've	ever known,	Luke	Nix.	Whenever	I	visit	Dogland,	you're	talking	with	someone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tourist,	worker,	child,	old	person,	white,	black--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	at	his	toes,	which	he	had	buried	in	the	sand.	"Well,	I	don't mind	a	few	people	at	a	time.	It's	the	herd	I	can't	stand." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now,	Susan	loves	people,	though	how	you'd	confuse	me	with	her,	I'd</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p289"></a>never	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're	much	alike." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	at	her,	then	at	me.	"What're	you	staring	at?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothing.	Sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Get	washed." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yessir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	liked	getting	in	cold	water	the	way	Ma	did,	as	slowly	as	you	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	the	way	Ma	and	I	liked	removing	Band-Aids,	too.	Pa	was completely	different.	Grown-ups	were	usually	wrong	about	obvious	things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	called,	"Gonna	take	all	day?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	gone	to	the	point	where	the	water	would	touch	the	bottom	of	my swimsuit,	and	the	suit	would	cling	to	my	legs.	"No,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	jump	in." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	leaped	forward,	sinking	to	my	shoulders	in	a	crouch,	then	sprang	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Feels	great,	doesn't	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	Becoming	aware	that	my	teeth	wanted	to	chatter,	I	let	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger,	Little	Bit,	Mrs.	DeLyon,	and	Pa	all	laughed.	I	grinned,	but	it did	no	good.	Pa	called,	"Now,	swim	back	and	forth	a	little." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	obeyed	by	dogpaddling	parallel	to	the	shore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	Pa	called.	"Over-hand." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	began	throwing	my	arms	over	my	head,	thrashing	from	side	to	side, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p290"></a>keeping	my	head	high	so	I	could	see	whether	alligators	or	water moccasins	might	swim	from	the	part	of	Hawkins	Springs	where	lily	pads were	thick	around	cypress	knees	and	anything	might	wait	for	a	small	boy who	was	just	the	right	size	to	stick	in	an	oven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kick!"	Pa	yelled.	"Kick	harder."	After	I	had	swum	back	and	forth several	times,	he	called,	"There.	Wasn't	so	bad." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged	extravagantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	pointed	across	the	springs,	toward	the	opening	to	the Suwannee.	"Lookit." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned.	Something	peered	at	us	from	close	to	the	bank	by	the	river.	I saw	the	top	of	a	dark	head	with	damp	hair,	and	then	the	watcher	slid under	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What?"	Pa	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mermaid,"	said	Little	Bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	laughed.	"Probably	a	log.	In	the	water,	things	look	different." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	said,	"A	manatee." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	saw	a	pi'ture	at	Mermaid	State	Park,"	said	Little	Bit.	"They	got	a place	to	live	there." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	had	the	world	in	which	to	live,"	said	Mrs.	DeLyon.	"The	manatee you	saw	was	an	old	one." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p291"></a>Little	Bit	nodded.	"I	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Because	of	its	size?"	Pa	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"We	have	reservations	for	damn	near	everything.	Manatees	and American	Indians.	Had	'em	for	Japanese-Americans	during	the	war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes	I'm	surprised	we	don't	have	one	for	Negroes.	Hmm.	Guess	that's what	Liberia	was	meant	to	be.	Wonder	why	it	didn't	work." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Too	expensive	to	send	people	back	to	Africa?"	said	Mrs.	DeLyon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Prob'ly,"	said	Pa.	"People	are	practical.	By	'43,	Romania	had	killed	a hundred	thousand	Jews,	which	was	getting	expensive.	So	they	offered	to send	Jews	to	any	country	that'd	pay	to	transport	'em.	A	Hollywood	writer named	Ben	Hecht	took	out	a	full-page	ad	in	the	New	York	Times	with	a headline,	'For	Sale	to	Humanity,	70,000	Jews,	Guaranteed	Human	Beings	at $50	Apiece.'	There	were	no	buyers.	So	the	Romanians	kept	doing	what	they knew	how	to	do.	Practical,	yep." </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	aluminum	boat	with	a	large	outboard	raced	past	on	the	Suwannee.	I said,	"I	hope	the	man'tee	dived." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	do	I,"	said	Mrs.	DeLyon.	Then	she	spoke	to	Pa.	"I've	heard	you	say you	admire	Earl	Warren." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Among	others.	So?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	was	California's	Attorney	General	during	the	war,"	said	Mrs.	DeLyon. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p292"></a>"He	had	an	important	part	in	creating	concentration	camps	for	Japanese Americans." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	maybe	he	learned.	Maybe	it's	just	that	when	you	get	a	job	on something	like	the	Supreme	Court,	you're	tempted	to	do	the	right	thing in	spite	of	yourself.	What's	your	point?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	have	hope,"	said	Mrs.	DeLyon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shrugged.	"Wouldn't	have	kids	if	I	didn't	have	hope." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p293"></a>Sally	and	Colleen	were	two	Yankee	college	girls	spending	their	summer vacation	driving	around	the	South,	taking	odd	jobs	for	a	week	or	two, waiting	tables	or	picking	fruit,	then	moving	on.	I	could	not	tell	them apart.	Many	people	passed	through	Dogland	for	a	week	or	a	month,	and	I only	remember	that	Sally	and	Colleen	were	loud	girls	with	nasal	accents like	Mr.	Kennedy,	the	man	Pa	liked	who	was	running	for	President	against Mr.	Nixon,	the	man	Ma	and	Grandma	Letitia	and	Grandpa	Abner	liked because	they	were	Republicans.	Sally	and	Colleen	liked	Mr.	Kennedy,	who was	"a	dreamboat"	and	"someone	who	would	change	things,	make	real changes	at	last,	really."	Maybe	that	was	why	Pa	often	talked	with	them about	the	coming	election. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Pa	and	we	kids	walked	back	from	Hawkins	Springs,	we	saw	Sally	and Colleen	waving	goodbye	as	Cal	Carter	and	Victor	Dalton	drove	away	in	a cloud	of	dust	and	gravel.	Sally	or	Colleen	saw	us	and	called,	"Hi,	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nix!	Hi,	Chris	and	Little	Bit	and	Digger!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hi,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"So,	you	know	someone	in	Latchahee	County?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Met	someone,"	said	Colleen	or	Sally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Victor	Dalton	and	Calvin	Coolidge	Carter	Junior."	said	Sally	or	Colleen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm,"	said	Pa.	"Dalton's	dad	is	the	banker.	He's	a	good	man.	Cal's</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p294"></a>married	to	one	of	our	girls.	Susan	must've	mentioned	her.	Francine, who's	gone	to	Georgia	to	care	for	her	grandmother." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	didn't	say	anything	about	being	married,"	said	Sally	or	Colleen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	you	did	tell	him	you	had	a	fianc�	in	Rhode	Island,"	said	Colleen	or Sally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"True,"	said	Sally	or	Colleen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why?"	said	Pa,	who	followed	this	with	a	grin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We're	going	out	Friday	night,"	said	Colleen	or	Sally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It'll	be	a	double-date,"	said	Sally	or	Colleen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just	like	in	high	school!"	said	Colleen	or	Sally,	and	they	both	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We're	going	Dutch.	First	to	the	Roadhouse	for	dinner,	then	we'll	catch a	double	feature	at	the--"	Colleen	or	Sally	made	a	face.	"Thee-Ayter." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	both	laughed	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sounds	like	fun,"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	it	will	be,"	said	Colleen	or	Sally.	"Then	there's	a	rock	and	roll band	from	Gainesville	at	the	Roadhouse." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your	fianc�	won't	mind?"	Pa	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	it's	not	that	kind	of	date,"	said	Sally	or	Colleen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"For	you,"	said	Colleen	or	Sally.	"I	don't	have	a	fianc�.	And	Victor's kind	of	cute.	He	isn't	married,	is	he?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	think	so,"	Pa	said,	"He's	going	to	Tampa	State,	or	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p295"></a>Isn't	it	about	time	to	feed	the	dogs?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	right	you	are,	Mr.	Nix.	James's	probably	got	their	food	mixed	and ready	by	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Probably,"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"People	are	so	polite	down	here.	Have	you	noticed	that,	Mr.	Nix?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Um	hmm.	It's	amazing	how	subtly	people	will	suggest	that	the	help	ought to	spend	a	little	time	now	and	then	earning	their	pay." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girls	laughed,	because	Pa	spoke	with	a	grin.	Laughing	together,	they walked	toward	the	dog	pens.	Pa	led	us	kids	into	the	new	wooden	gift	shop that	he,	Handyman,	Ethorne,	and	a	few	helpers	were	building	next	to	the restaurant.	My	part	in	the	construction	had	been	to	crawl,	hot,	sticky, and	itching,	through	the	rafters	in	the	low	attic,	unrolling	pink fiberglass	insulation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	was	building	pegboard	frames	to	hang	up	items	for	sale	like Florida	playing	cards,	smoke	bombs,	and	plastic	conquistador	helmets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	grinned,	and	Little	Bit	and	I	both	yelled,	"Hi,	Ethorne!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	set	aside	his	screwdriver.	"How	y'all?	Looks	like	somebody	fell	in the	water." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	nodded,	and	Little	said,	"I	did,"	then	added,	"We	saw	a	mermaid." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	tell?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	manatee,"	I	explained. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p296"></a>"Oh,	a	manatee.	That's	'bout	like	a	mermaid.	You	know,	they	got	sea	cows</p>
<p class="calibre1">'round	Africa	and	'round	here.	Both	black	folks	and	red	folks	tol' </p>
<p class="calibre1">stories	'bout	folks	who	turn	into	sea	cows.	Or	maybe	it's	sea	cows	who turn	into	folks." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	just	stories,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Those	frames	look	good,"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	tapped	one.	"Comin'	along." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	at	us.	"Why	don't	you	kids	go	put	away	your	swim	stuff?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Okay,"	Little	Bit	answered,	and	I	nodded.	Outside	the	gift	shop,	I stooped	to	look	at	several	empty	paint	cans	while	Digger	and	Little	Bit went	to	the	house.	I	touched	the	inside	of	one	can,	and	the	tip	of	my finger	came	away	covered	with	slick	white	goo.	I	rubbed	the	goo	off	on my	pants,	saw	what	a	mess	that	made,	and	rubbed	dirt	into	it	so	the	dirt would	get	the	paint	off.	And	while	I	was	doing	that,	I	heard	Pa	say, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ethorne?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	Mist'	Luke?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're	proving	such	a	help	on	the	grounds	that	I	think	we'll	let Mayella	and	Lurleen	handle	the	cooking." </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	moment,	Ethorne	said,	"I	don't	mean	nothin'	again'	either	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">'em,	but	they	don't	exactly	come	up	with	inspirin'	eatin',	if	you	know what	I	mean." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p297"></a>Pa	laughed.	"I	do.	But,	well,	it	seems	that	for	all	the	compliments	we get	on	your	cooking,	we	get	just	as	many	complaints." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh,"	said	Ethorne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Doesn't	mean	anything,"	said	Pa.	"I'd	eat	your	cooking	forever." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh,"	Ethorne	repeated.	"I	bes'	finish	up	this	frame	before	quittin' </p>
<p class="calibre1">time,	Mist'	Luke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I--"	Pa	began,	but	he	only	finished,	"All	right."	I	heard	him	walking away	from	Ethorne,	so	I	began	scrabbling	more	earnestly	in	the	gravel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Pa	came	out	the	door,	he	said,	"What're	you	doing?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Playing,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Get	changed,"	Pa	said,	walking	toward	the	dog	pens.	"It's	nearly	dinner." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yessir."	I	ran	to	the	house.	"Playing"	was	the	best	excuse	I	had	ever found.	One	day	when	Ma	was	cleaning	the	women's	bathroom,	I	scuttled across	the	floor	on	my	hands	and	knees,	racing	between	her	legs	and peeking	up	her	skirt	as	I	went.	When	she	asked	me	what	I	was	doing,	I said,	"Playing."	She	looked	at	me,	then	said,	"Maybe	you'd	better	play outside	so	I	can	finish	in	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p298"></a>When	Little	Bit	told	Mayella	about	the	mermaid,	Mayella	laughed	and laughed.	"You	don'	fear	no	manatees,	do	you,	girl?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	Little	Bit	said	solemnly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good,"	said	Mayella.	"Manatees	don'	hurt	nobody.	They	just	swim	along, thinkin'	their	deep	river	dreams." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Deep	river	dreams?"	I	said.	"What's	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	smiled.	"That's	when	everything's	slow	and	peaceful,	and	there's plenty	to	eat,	and	there's	company	when	you	want	it,	and	nothing	happens in	a	hurry,	and	you	can	think	all	you	want	on	what	God	is	and	what	God wants,	and	you	can	know	it	don't	much	matter	'cause	you	doin'	what	you s'posed	to,	and	God's	doin'	what	God's	s'posed	to.	That's	deep	river dreamin'." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p299"></a>Pa	put	a	Coca-cola	machine	in	the	Doggy	Salon.	Tourists	commented	on	it because	it	was	old,	a	low,	squat	red	machine	with	a	glass	door	in	one side	where	the	bottles	of	Coke	waited	to	be	pulled	out,	and	because	it was	cheap,	only	a	nickel	a	bottle	though	many	places	had	begun	selling Coke	for	a	dime,	and	because	Pa	kept	wooden	trays	of	full	Coke	bottles stacked	next	to	the	machine.	When	people	asked	why	he	wasn't	afraid they'd	be	stolen,	Pa	would	point	out	that	no	one	could	smuggle	trays	of Coke	through	the	gift	shop	and	past	Mrs.	Stark,	an	older	widow	who worked	in	the	giftshop	as	our	cashier,	and	no	one	would	want	to	drink	a bottle	of	warm	Coke	on	a	hot	day	when	a	cold	one	was	available	for	five cents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	Pa	did	not	know	was	that	when	one	of	the	dispensing	holes	was	empty because	all	the	Cokes	in	the	rack	feeding	that	slot	had	been	sold,	you could	shove	a	warm	Coke	bottle	into	the	hole.	And	if	you	didn't	push	it in	all	the	way,	it	didn't	get	latched	inside,	and	if	a	tourist	didn't drop	in	a	nickel	and	take	that	bottle,	you	could	pull	it	out,	nice	and cool,	anytime	you	wanted	and	go	hide	in	the	closet	of	Ma	and	Pa's bedroom,	the	absolute	last	place	anyone	would	look	for	you,	and	drink the	Coke,	which	was	probably	still	a	little	warm	because	who	could wait?--even	though	you'd	have	to	share	it	with	Digger	and	Little	Bit, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p300"></a>not	because	they	would	tell	but	because	they	would	make	too	much	noise laughing	or	begging	for	a	drink	if	you	didn't	let	them	have	some. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	can't	remember	if	I	quit	chilling	Cokes	because	I	realized	that	was stealing.	I	think	a	tourist	reached	for	the	bottle	that	I	had	been cooling	for	a	long	half	hour,	and	I	asked	the	tourist	to	take	a different	one,	and	the	tourist	told	my	parents. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p301"></a>Most	Sundays,	Ma	took	us	to	Sunday	school	in	Dickison.	On	hot	days,	we would	fan	ourselves	with	paper	fans	that	showed	Jesus	with	his	long blond	hair	and	beard,	dressed	in	a	white	robe	and	leather	sandals, holding	his	arms	wide	for	an	embrace	that	anticipated	his	crucifixion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	we	went	with	Mayella	to	her	church,	and	though	everyone	was colored,	and	they	sang	more	than	in	the	white	people's	church,	they	used the	same	paper	fans. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p302"></a>We	kids	all	showered	together	when	we	were	small.	Afterwards,	Little	Bit would	do	the	Naked	Dance,	whirling	from	the	bathroom	into	the	kids'	room wrapped	in	a	beach	towel	that	she	would	discard	while	Digger	and	I clapped.	Ma	stopped	the	Naked	Dances	and	the	shared	showers	at	about	the same	time.	Digger	and	I	continued	to	shower	together,	and	sometimes,	Pa showered	with	us.	Pa	looked	like	us,	only	bigger	and	hairier	and	more muscled.	Ma	wore	dresses	and	had	long	hair,	but	those	were	the	only traits	she	shared	with	Little	Bit	that	I	could	tell. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p303"></a>Dog	babies	were	tiny	and	blind,	and	if	you	scared	the	mother,	she	might bite	you.	But	when	Ma	or	Pa	said	the	babies	were	old	enough,	you	could hold	one	in	your	hands	and	it	would	snuffle	against	your	skin,	trying	to find	out	if	you	were	its	mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p304"></a>Early	one	evening	after	dinner	but	before	dark,	I	was	circling	the	Heart Tree	with	a	cap	rifle	when	a	car	horn	honked.	Cal	and	Victor	got	out	of Victor's	red	Chevrolet	convertible.	"Hey,	boy,"	Victor	called,	"you	know Colleen	and	Sally?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	them	and	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sure	you	do,"	said	Cal,	laughing.	"You	want	to	run	tell	'em	we're	here, boss-boy?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	grinned,	nodded,	and	ran. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Colleen	and	Sally	had	a	small	trailer,	just	big	enough	for	two	bunks	and a	tiny	kitchen,	that	they	had	parked	next	to	our	house.	I	banged	on	the door.	Sally	or	Colleen	looked	out	and	laughed	even	before	I	said,	"Cal an'	Victor	are	here."	I	pointed	up	at	the	parking	lot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Already?"	said	Colleen	or	Sally,	inside	the	trailer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Already,"	said	Sally	or	Colleen.	Then	she	told	me,	"Tell	them	to	hold their	horses;	we'll	be	ready	in	a	sec;	we're	putting	on	our	faces,	okay?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're	a	dear,"	said	Sally	or	Colleen,	and	the	door	closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	ran	up	to	the	parking	lot.	Victor	was	sitting	in	the	passenger	seat, looking	in	the	mirror	as	he	combed	his	hair	back.	Cal	was	sitting	on	the front	bumper,	smoking	a	cigarette.	He	looked	at	me	and	said,	"Well, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p305"></a>boss-boy?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're	s'posed	to	hold	the	horses.	They're	puttin'	on	their	faces." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	was	figurin'	on	holdin'	something	else,"	said	Victor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	goin'	to	have	a	white	horse	an'	a	black	horse	when	I	grow	up,"	I said.	"I'll	ride	the	white	one	in	the	day	time	an'	the	black	one	in	the night." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Victor	frowned	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal	pointed	away.	"Umm-hmmm,	lookathere." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where?"	said	Victor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"G'night,	Mayella!"	I	called,	waving	as	hard	as	I	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stopped	in	the	middle	of	the	semicircular	driveway	and	looked	at	us without	any	expression.	Ethorne	had	not	come	to	work	that	day,	or	the day	before,	and	Seth	and	James	had	left	earlier,	before	supper,	so	she was	walking	home.	"Good	night,	Chris,"	she	said	quietly,	and	she	walked	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Brown	sugar,"	Cal	told	Victor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Victor	laughed	and	nudged	him.	"You	a	dog.	You	such	a	dog." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	like	cimanin	sugar,"	I	said.	"On	toast." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	'cause	you're	a	Yankee,"	said	Cal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Everyone	likes	cimanin	sugar,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"On	toast,"	said	Cal,	nodding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Victor	said,	"Ain't	any	kind	of	sugar	that	this	houn'	dog	don't	like." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p306"></a>Cal	looked	up	at	the	sky	and	bayed	like	Colonel,	our	Blood	Hound.	As	I laughed,	I	heard	Colleen	or	Sally	say,	"I	do	believe	the	gentlemen	approve." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	how,"	said	Cal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned.	Colleen	and	Sally	wore	dresses,	one	pink	and	flounced	at	the waist,	one	blue	and	close-fitting.	"You	look	like	princesses,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,"	said	Colleen	or	Sally.	"Then	I	guess	our	work	was	not	in	vain." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	a'tall,"	said	Victor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sally	or	Colleen	said,	"We	haven't	had	an	excuse	to	dress	up	all	summer." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Glad	to	provide	one,	ladies,"	said	Cal.	"Hop	in.	Dinner's	calling." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	didn't	mention	you	were	married,"	said	Sally	or	Colleen	as	both girls	got	into	the	backseat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Didn't	think	I	needed	to	after	you	mentioned	your	fee-oncy."	Cal grinned.	"Goin'	dancin'	don'	mean	goin'	romancin'.	Wasn't	we	just	goin' </p>
<p class="calibre1">to	show	you	how	we	have	fun	'round	here?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fine,"	said	Sally	or	Colleen.	"I	just	wanted	to	be	sure." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	waved	goodbye.	Sally	or	Colleen	waved	back,	one	hand	twisting	from side	to	side	at	the	wrist.	When	I	turned,	Ma	had	come	out	of	the	gift shop,	where	she	counted	up	the	money	at	the	end	of	the	day	after	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stark	had	closed	the	building.	She	said,	"Didn't	they	look	nice?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	wouldn't	have	thought	those	boys	owned	ties,	let	alone	sports</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p307"></a>jackets."	She	came	and	touched	my	shoulder.	"You're	getting	to	be	a	big boy,	Chris." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	grinned.	"Time	to	measure	me	again?"	The	inside	bathroom	doorframe bore	the	marks	and	dates	of	the	measurements	of	each	kid's	height,	and	I enjoyed	the	inexorable	progress,	a	promise	that	someday	I	could	be	as tall	as	Pa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	laughed.	"I	don't	think	you've	grown	that	much	since	Sunday." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	was	just	thinking	that	someday	I'd	watch	you	going	off	on	a	date." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"With	a	girl?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed	and	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yuck!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	said,	"You'll	think	differently	when	you're	older."	And	then	she bent	over	and	kissed	my	cheek. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yuck!"	I	repeated,	and	wiped	my	cheek	with	my	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are	you	getting	too	big	to	be	kissed	by	your	mother?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rolled	my	eyes	and	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're	never	too	big	to	be	kissed	by	your	mother,"	Ma	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Okay,"	I	conceded,	and	Ma	laughed.	"Come	on.	It's	time	to	get	into	your peejays." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Already?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p308"></a>"Digger's	sound	asleep,	and	Little	Bit's	in	hers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	right,"	I	said	sadly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	laughed	again.	"Life	sure	is	hard	on	some	people." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p309"></a>I	woke	sometime	in	the	middle	of	the	night	and	pushed	myself	up	onto	my arms	to	see	why.	The	night-light	showed	me	that	Digger,	curled	like	a cat,	was	still	asleep	and	Little	Bit,	on	her	back	like	a	mummy,	was already	awake.	She	watched	me	from	the	corners	of	her	eyes.	Car	lights shone	through	the	window	above	her	head.	Someone	was	moving	around	in the	yard.	I	wanted	to	call	for	Ma	or	Pa,	then	realized	that	I	heard their	voices	outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	ran	across	the	cold	linoleum	floor	to	stand	on	Little	Bit's	bed	and peer	through	the	louvered	windows.	Little	Bit,	without	moving,	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	you	see?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ma	an'	Pa	an'	C'leen	an'	Sally." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who's	cryin'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	hadn't	realized	anyone	was	crying.	I	looked	closer.	"Ma.	No.	C'leen an'	Sally."	One	was	crying	while	Ma	embraced	her,	and	the	other	was furious,	making	fists	and	faces	at	Pa,	who	stood	there	with	his	hands before	him	in	a	rare	gesture	of	helplessness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who	hurt	'em?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	dunno." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nobody	should	hurt	'em." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They're	hitchin'	up	the	trailer!	Pa's	helpin'." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p310"></a>"They're	takin'	me	swimmin'	tomorrow.	Co-leen	said." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	no	more,"	I	said.	"They're	leavin'." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who	hurt	'em?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	know!"	I	said,	annoyed	that	she	had	asked	me	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Somebody	hurt	'em!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Maybe	Cal	an'	Victor." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Cal	an'	Victor." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Maybe,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	watched	Colleen	and	Sally	get	into	their	old	dark	coupe	and	rattle toward	the	highway.	I	watched	Ma	and	Pa	looking	after	them	as	they turned	north	and	drove	out	of	this	story	of	my	life.	I	watched	Pa	put his	arm	around	Ma	and	lead	her	toward	the	door	to	their	room.	I	ducked down	and	off	Little	Bit's	bed,	whispering,	"They	left."	Then	I	added, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pa	hugged	Ma,"	and	I	returned	to	my	bed.	When	Ma	looked	in	a	moment later,	Little	Bit	and	I	pretended	we	were	sleeping	as	soundly	as	Digger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps	Little	Bit	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p311"></a>The	next	afternoon,	Cal	and	Victor	drove	into	the	parking	lot.	Digger, Little	Bit,	and	I	were	playing	by	the	Heart	Tree.	I	started	to	wave,	but Little	Bit	made	a	face	and	turned	her	back,	so	I	merely	watched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal	called,	"Hey,	boss-boy!	Sally	or	Colleen	around?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	don't	know	where	Pa	came	from,	perhaps	from	the	gift	shop,	perhaps from	the	kitchen.	He	walked	toward	them	with	a	stride	that	would	have made	me	want	to	run	in	the	opposite	direction.	He	gave	Cal	and	Victor the	steady	look	that	said	you	had	better	not	run.	Maybe	that's	why	they waited.	Pa	asked	in	his	calm-before-the-storm	voice,	"Why?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh	oh,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good,"	Little	Bit	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal	smiled.	"How	you,	Mister	Nix?	Elvis	Presley's	in	a	movie	at	the drive-in.	We	was	wonderin'	if	the	girls	wanted	some	fun." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	to	the	gift	shop	opened,	and	Ma	stepped	out.	Mrs.	Stark,	who never	missed	anything	interesting,	looked	through	the	gift	shop	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lurleen	watched	from	the	front	of	the	restaurant,	and	the	kitchen	door was	open	wide	enough	for	Mayella	to	see	and	hear.	Ethorne	and	the	rest of	the	staff	were	back	with	the	dogs.	I	was	the	only	male	observer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Get	off	my	property,"	Pa	said.	The	storm	had	yet	to	break. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's	the	matter?"	said	Victor.	"We	only	want	to	talk	to	the	girls." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p312"></a>"Now,"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Victor	said,	"Hold	on,"	and	began	to	open	his	car	door.	Pa	stopped	it with	the	flat	of	his	hand,	and	he	and	Victor	strained	against	each other.	Victor	was	a	foot	taller	than	Pa,	but	I	knew	who	was	stronger.	Ma called,	"Luke!"	as	Victor	said,	"This	here's	a	public	business,	Mister Nix.	You	can't	run	us	off,	and	those	girls	ain't	your	slaves.	If	you--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	released	the	door,	grabbed	Victor	by	his	golf	shirt,	and	yanked	him forward,	out	of	the	car.	Victor	sprawled	onto	the	gravel,	and	Pa	put	an engineer	boot	against	the	back	of	his	head.	"You	hear	what	I	said?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah!"	screamed	Victor	as	Pa	bore	down	on	his	boot.	"I	hear!	I	hear!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal	came	running	around	the	side	of	the	car,	but	he	stopped	when	Pa pointed	at	him.	Cal	spread	his	arms	wide.	"Mister	Nix,	I--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Off	my	land,"	Pa	said.	"I	don't	ever	want	to	see	your	face	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Either	of	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sure,"	Cal	said.	"Sure	thing.	Let	him	up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Victor	scrambled	to	his	feet.	The	side	of	his	face	was	red,	and	pieces of	gravel	clung	to	his	skin.	"My	daddy	was	good	to	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	kicked	the	convertible's	door	shut	as	Victor	reached	for	the	handle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Get." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	my	car!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Get,"	Pa	said,	starting	forward	with	one	fist	cocked	at	his	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p313"></a>"Come	on,"	said	Cal,	walking	toward	the	highway.	"We'll	let	that	damn sherriff	know	what	happened	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No	need,"	Pa	said,	starting	after	Cal	and	Victor.	"Susan!	Call	the sheriff!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	yelled,	"Luke,	don't	hurt	them!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Call	the	goddamn	sheriff!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	at	him,	then	ran	back	inside.	Cal	and	Victor	had	stopped	near the	top	of	the	driveway.	"Get	the	hell	off	my	property!"	Pa	yelled, taking	several	quick	steps	after	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal	and	Victor	backed	away	so	quickly	that	a	passing	car	honked	as	it swerved	around	them.	"Don't	mess	with	my	car!"	Victor	called. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	won't	touch	your	daddy's	car,"	Pa	said.	"Start	walking." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Victor	squatted	at	the	edge	of	the	highway.	Cal	looked	at	him,	then shrugged	and	stood	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I	won't	tell	you	again." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal	yelled,	"We're	off	your	land,	Mr.	Nix.	I	don't	know	what's	got	in your	bonnet.	We	ain't	done	nothin'	that's	none	of	your	business." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's--"	Pa	began,	but	he	stopped	and	turned	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	kitchen	door	closed,	and	Lurleen	moved	away	from	the	front	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	elderly	couple	came	out	of	the	gift	shop,	looked	at	Pa,	and	hurried to	their	car	as	Mrs.	Stark	called,	"Y'all	come	back	soon	now,	hear?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p314"></a>Ma	came	out	and	said,	"Rooster	Donati's	on	the	way." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stood	there,	looking	at	Pa	until	he	said,	"Good.	Everyone	can	get back	to	work.	What'm	I	paying	people	for,	anyway?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Stark	smiled	and	nodded.	"Yes,	sir,	Luke.	Everything's	fine	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	at	me.	"You	see	either	of	those	two	on	the	property,	come	get	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yessir,	Pa."	I	sat	cross-legged	under	the	Heart	Tree	with	my	cap	rifle across	my	lap.	Pa	went	back	toward	the	Doggy	Salon,	and	we	kids	were alone	again,	alone	if	you	did	not	count	the	occasional	tourist	passing by	or	Ma	looking	out	at	us	every	two	or	three	minutes	with	her	lower	lip pinched	between	her	teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"Pa	should've	shooted	them." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	di'n't	have	a	gun,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	shrugged.	"He	should've	shooted	them	anyway." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn't	bother	to	answer.	Victor	sat	on	the	edge	of	the	highway, staring	at	his	car	in	our	lot	while	punching	his	right	fist	into	his palm.	Cal	walked	around	behind	him,	talking	constantly	and	laughing sometimes,	though	Victor	never	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	ten	or	fifteen	minutes,	Victor	stood	up,	looked	down	the	highway, and	grinned.	When	the	sheriff's	car	turned	into	the	driveway,	they followed	it	down.	I	ran	back	to	the	Doggy	Salon,	yelling,	"Pa,	Pa,	they came	back	even	though	you	told	'em	not	to!	An'	the	police're	here,	too!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p315"></a>Pa	came	out	of	the	grooming	area.	James,	clipping	the	black	poodle's toenails,	glanced	at	me	and	kept	working,	saying	only,	"Mist'	Luke?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I'll	be	back	in	a	bit." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	walked	toward	the	back	of	the	gift	shop,	Ma	yelled,	"Luke!	Sheriff Donati's	here!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	We	went	through	the	gift	shop	and	into	the	front.	Sheriff Donati,	a	barrel-chested,	balding	man	with	a	pistol	on	his	hip	and	a	hat like	Smokey	the	Bear's,	stood	beside	his	car.	Victor	was	telling	him	how they	hadn't	done	a	thing.	The	sheriff's	eyes	flicked	from	Victor	to	Pa to	me	with	my	cap	rifle	to	Pa	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I	ordered	them	off	my	property." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sheriff	Donati	looked	at	Victor.	"That	so?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah,"	said	Victor.	"Then	he	threw	me	down--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	didn't	get	off	his	property?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	said	Victor.	"This	here's	a	public--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	reckon	you	better	get	offa	here	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	he	threw--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We'll	straighten	this	out,"	said	Sheriff	Donati.	"Be	a	little	easier	if you'd	get,	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal	tugged	Victor's	arm,	and	they	started	toward	the	red	convertible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're	not	driving	that	off	this	property,"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p316"></a>"But--"	said	Victor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Go	on	up	by	the	highway,"	said	Sheriff	Donati,	waggling	his	fingers	to shoo	Victor.	"Looked	like	you	found	a	good	place	to	sit."	He	turned	his back	on	them	immediately	and	held	out	his	hand	to	Pa.	"Luke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Rooster,"	Pa	said	as	they	shook.	"Sorry	to	call	you	out."	Behind	them, Victor	jabbed	his	finger	at	the	sheriff's	back,	then	trudged	after	Cal toward	the	highway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	my	business,"	Sheriff	Donati	said.	"How're	you,	Chris?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fine,"	I	said,	and	stepped	behind	Pa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	a	good	one,"	Sheriff	Donati	told	Pa	with	a	laugh,	and	then	the laugh	left	his	face.	"Susan	said	somethin'	'bout	'em	hurting	two	o'	your hired	gals	last	night." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sheriff	Donati	said,	"I	should	talk	to	the	gals." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	headed	home,"	said	Pa.	"North." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh."	Sheriff	Donati	took	off	his	hat	and	fanned	himself	with	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Prob'ly	for	the	best." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	got	no	call	to	harass	those	boys,	you	know,"	Sheriff	Donati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	came	whipping	in	here	like	they	were	drunk,"	Pa	said.	"How	do	I know	they	didn't	steal	that	car?	They	were	rude	to	me.	You	saying	a	free</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p317"></a>American	can't	kick	a	couple	of	little	know-nothings	off	his	property?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sheriff	Donati	said,	"You	had	'em	sit	in	the	sun	for	awhile.	You embarassed	'em	in	front	of	each	other	and	everyone	who	happened	by. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Story'll	be	all	over	the	county	by	church-time	tomorrow.	I	reckon	that's pretty	good." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh?"	said	Pa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	ain't	niggers,"	Sheriff	Donati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	didn't	see	the	girls,"	said	Pa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yankee	gals	runnin'	'round	with	grown	boys--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah,"	said	Pa.	"They're	not	taking	that	car.	Jack	Dalton	can	come	for it	if	he	wants	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sheriff	Donati	looked	at	me,	then	nodded.	"I'll	have	to	give	'em	rides home." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	do	what	you	have	to." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Cal	don't	live	far,"	I	said.	"Francine	used	to	walk	all	the	time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	and	the	sheriff	laughed.	Sheriff	Donati	said,	"All	right,	one	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">'em'll	put	a	couple	miles	on	his	best	shoes."	Then	he	said,	"I	have three	daughters	of	my	own,	you	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"No,	I	didn't." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	ain't	that	I	don't	feel	for	them	Yankee	gals.	But	they	made	a mistake.	Man	can't	protect	ever'body	from	their	own	mistakes." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p318"></a>"A	man	protects	everyone	he	can." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sheriff	nodded.	"That's	so.	But	in	this	here	case,	it	looks	like what's	done	is	done." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	up	at	the	boys	on	the	highway.	"They're	not	coming	back	on	my property." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	tell	'em,"	the	sheriff	said,	putting	his	hat	back	on	his	head.	He made	a	pistol	with	his	fingers	and	shot	me,	and	I	laughed,	then	he	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"See	you,	Luke,"	got	in	his	car,	and	drove	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	hour	or	two	later,	a	gleaming	black	car	stopped	by	the	driveway.	The banker	got	out,	and	the	car	turned	around	and	drove	away.	As	the	banker walked	down	the	gravel	in	his	suit	and	gleaming	shoes,	I	called,	"Hi, Mr.	Dalton!"	He	looked	at	me	and	nodded.	I	called,	"How're	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fine,"	he	said	quietly,	and	did	not	bring	any	lollipops	out	of	his pocket.	"Where's	your	father?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Here,"	Pa	said,	coming	from	the	gift	shop	with	a	key	in	his	hand.	He smiled	as	though	nothing	had	gone	wrong	all	day.	"Sorry	you	had	to	come yourself,	Jack.	I	thought	you'd	send	a	tow	truck	and	take	it	out	of	the boy's	allowance,	or	something." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Vic	isn't	spoiled,"	said	Mr.	Dalton,	taking	the	key	from	Pa.	"And	he isn't	wild,	either." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Umm." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p319"></a>"He	doesn't	keep	the	best	company,	but	boys'll	be	boys,	you	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah,"	said	Pa.	"I	wonder	sometimes	if	men'll	learn	to	be	men." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p320"></a>I	don't	remember	the	transition	from	being	afraid	to	swim	to	being	able to	swim.	I	remember	Pa	throwing	me	from	the	dock	at	Mermaid	Springs while	Ma	looked	nervous,	and	I	swam	straight	back,	but	that	wasn't really	swimming.	That	was	survival.	Pa	once	said,	"You	just	do	it,	and then	you	aren't	scared."	Ma	once	said,	"I	never	learned,	but	I	never	had the	chance	to	learn	when	I	was	your	age.	You've	seen	the	bigger	boys swimming,	haven't	you?	You'll	be	just	like	them." </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	parents	volunteered	those	comments.	I	had	to	ask	everyone	else.	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drake	said,	"You	keep	practicing,	and	you	keep	getting	better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything's	like	that."	Mrs.	DeLyon	said,	"Water's	an	environment,	like the	ground	and	the	air.	You	learn	its	ways.	You	learn	to	trust	it,	and respect	it.	And	then	you	swim." </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	asked	Ethorne,	he	laughed	and	said,	"Oh,	that	was	too	long	ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	'member	how	you	learned	to	walk?"	I	said,	"I	was	just	a	baby."	He said,	"Well,	there	you	is,"	which	did	not	help	me	at	all.	He	laughed again	and	said,	"You	want	to	talk	to	someone	who	knows	'bout	swimmin', you	talk	to	Mayella.	She's	the	swimminest	fool	I	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mayella?"	I	said.	In	my	understanding	of	the	world,	all	men	could	swim, but	only	some	women	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sure.	Her	momma	was	the	queen	of	the	sea.	Ain't	nobody	knows	more	'bout</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p321"></a>swimmin'	than	Mayella." </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	afternoon	when	the	restaurant	was	empty	of	customers	and	Lurleen	was at	a	table	smoking	a	cigarette	while	reading	a	copy	of	Look,	a	picture magazine	which	had	letters	in	the	middle	of	its	name	that	might	be	two eyes	if	you	drew	in	pupils	or	two	heads	if	you	drew	in	eyes	and	mouths, Little	Bit	and	I	sat	at	the	counter	and	drank	glasses	of	milk	through plastic	straws.	I	asked	Mayella,	"Could	you	really	swim	before	you	could walk?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	giggled,	and	Mayella	said,	"Why,	can't	say	I	remember	either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why	you	ask?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just	askin',"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	I	see." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Was	it	hard?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	not--"	She	looked	at	me.	"Well,	first	it	was	hard.	But	you	know	what?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"When	you	in	the	water,	you	just	got	to	quit	thinkin'	you	a	land critter.	Like	Mr.	Turtle.	When	he's	on	land,	he	thinks	he's	a	land critter.	But	you	know	what	he	thinks	soon	as	he's	in	the	water?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	a	water	critter?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	how	do	you	do	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p322"></a>"You	want	to	think	like	'em,	you	got	to	act	like	'em.	Do	you	splash around	an'	get	all	antsy	when	you	in	the	water?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	Mr.	Turtle	do	like	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head.	"He's	a	turtle." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,"	said	Mayella.	"What	about	manatees?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	like	people,"	said	Mayella.	"They	breathe	the	air.	How	you	think they	learn	to	swim?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	just	swim?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	nothing	just	nothing.	Everything's	got	to	learn.	Some	learns easier	'n	others,	that's	all.	How	you	think	li'l	manatee	babies	learn	to swim?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Their	parents	teach	'em?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just	'cause	someone	teaches	don'	mean	nobody	learns.	How	you	think	they learn?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wrinkled	up	my	forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Think	on	it.	A	li'l	manatee	baby	in	the	water.	What's	it	doin'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Playing!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	laughed.	"See?	You	got	it	figured	out	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p323"></a>Near	the	end	of	a	day	near	the	end	of	summer,	I	saw	Ethorne	walking	down Dogland's	driveway.	I	knew	he	was	drunk	by	his	walk,	an	awkard exaggeration	of	his	usual	saunter.	I	looked	down	at	the	dirt	where Digger	and	I	were	playing	with	toy	trucks,	but	Digger	looked	up	and grinned	at	Ethorne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	you	boys?"	Ethorne	called.	"How	you	been?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fine,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tha's	good.	Ever'one	ought	to	be	jus'	fine.	Where's	yo'	pappy?"	He laughed,	though	I	did	not	know	why.	"Yo'	pappy,	he's	a	good	man.	Y'all ought	to	be	proud	of	a	fine	man	like	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	sir,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Y'all	ain'	scared	o'	me?"	Ethorne	drew	himself	up.	"Ain'	nothin'	to	be scared	of."	He	came	close.	He	smelled	like	flowers	that	had	festered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	I	said,	which	was	a	truth.	I	was	wary,	or	I	was	prepared	to	be scared,	but	I	liked	Ethorne	too	much	to	be	afraid	just	because everything	he	said	and	did	was	excessive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	yo'	pappy--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hello,	Ethorne,"	Ma	said,	coming	up	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	whirled,	snatching	his	straw	hat	from	his	head	and	sweeping	it	low before	him	like	a	stage	courtier.	"Mis'	Susan!	How	you!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p324"></a>"Fine,	Ethorne.	We	missed	you	the	last	week." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	I	been--"	Ethorne	looked	away,	worked	his	lips	so	his	moustache crawled	like	a	dancing	centipede,	then	said,	"'Round.	Busy,	you	know.	Is Mist'	Luke	about?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	went	into	town	on	errands,"	Ma	said.	"Something	I	can	do?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	I	don'	know.	Maybe	I	bes'	wait	fo'	Mist'	Luke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	know,	Ethorne.	You	look	like	you've	been	feeling	pretty	good." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	ma'am."	He	grinned,	and	so	did	I,	since	Ma	was	not	worried.	"Tha's what	I	wanted	t'	talk	to	Mist'	Luke	about." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Luke's	not	very	understanding	about	drinking,	Ethorne.	I	think	it'd	be best	if	you	came	back	when	you	weren't--"	She	smiled.	"--feelin'	so good."	I	heard	something	under	her	smile	that	Ethorne	missed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	no,	ma'am.	Tha's	the	problem.	Tha's	precisely	the	problem." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	is?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	need	me	a	fi'	dollar	advance." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma's	smile	broadened.	"You're	still	working	here,	then?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	yes,	ma'am.	When	I's	a	mind	to." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Doesn't	look	like	your	mind	has	much	to	do	with	whether	you	work	today." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	grinned	weakly.	"Well,	tha's	true.	I	need	me	a	li'l	pick-me-up, is	what	I	need." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	know,	Ethorne." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p325"></a>He	nodded	and	sat	in	the	dirt	in	front	of	Digger,	who	laughed.	"Then I'll	jus'	wait	on	Mist'	Luke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	Ethorne,	I--"	Ma	looked	at	Digger	and	me,	then	said,	"I'll	lend	you five	dollars,	Ethorne.	But	this'll	be	our	secret,	understand?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	ma'am,	I	do.	Thank	you,	ma'am.	Thank	you	kindly."	He	kissed	the bill	Ma	gave	him,	then	turned	it,	showing	Lincoln's	face.	"Y'know,	he di'n't	want	to	free	the	slaves.	But	he	freed	'em	anyway	when	he	thought it'd	he'p	him	win	the	war,	an'	I	love	him	fo'	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said	quietly,	"I	thought	you	said	you	were	quitting	drinking." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tha's	so.	T'morrow,	I	quit	again." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ethorne,	why	do	you	do	that	to	yourself?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	a	man	needs	a	li'l	vacation	now'n	then.	I's	on	the	way	here	las' </p>
<p class="calibre1">week,	but	Mist'	Lumiere	say	he	have	a	li'l	job	fo'	me.	An'	when	I	do	it, he	as'	me	if	I	druther	have	fi'	dollars	or	two	bottles	o'	Jim	Beam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mist'	Beam,	he's	good	company." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Ethorne	walked	away,	Ma	called,	"We'll	see	you	tomorrow?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	ma'am.	I'll	be	needin'	a	vacation	from	my	vacation	by	then." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	watched	with	her	lips	pursed	as	Ethorne	strolled	off	like	an	able seaman	on	a	storm-tossed	ship.	Her	hand	touched	my	head,	and	she	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ethorne'll	pay	me	back.	Your	father	doesn't	have	to	know	about	this." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded,	and	her	hand	left	my	head.	I	looked	up,	followed	her	gaze, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p326"></a>expecting	to	see	Pa,	and	saw	Mayella	instead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	said,	"You	di'n't	give	him	no	money,	did	you,	ma'am?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	could	hardly	say	no." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella's	face	tightened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"I	didn't	know	what	to	do.	If	Luke	found	him	drunk--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tha's	all	right,	ma'am.	Better	you'n	some	others." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ethorne's	good	for	it,	I'm	sure." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	yes'm.	That's	the	problem.	He	always	pays	his	debts." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're	not--"	Ma's	eyes	flicked	toward	Ethorne	as	he	crossed	to	the	far side	of	the	highway.	"--hurting,	are	you?	I	mean,	I'd	hate	for	anyone	to go	hungry	if	we--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	no,	ma'am!	It's	just	Ethorne	I	worry	'bout." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mmm."	Ma	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	and	James	walked	up	from	the	dog	pens	then.	James	called,	"We	all done,	Mis'	Nix!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No	problems?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"None	at	all,	ma'am,"	said	Seth.	"Um,	Mayella--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Them	Newbury	sisters?	I	thought	you	done	spent	all	your	money	on	'em." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	smiled.	"We	have	our	ways." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	said,	"Um	hmm,	but	mos'	folks	forgive	you	for	'em." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	laughed.	"We	done	cleared	some	brush	fo'	Mist'	Lumiere	over	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p327"></a>weekend." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"He	didn't	pay	you	in	liquor?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	frowned	at	her.	"Why,	no,	ma'am." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	said,	"Good	green	folding	stuff,	ma'am." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	laughed.	"And	it's	burning	a	hole	through	your	pockets." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	said,	"Tha's	not	what's	burnin'." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	looked	as	if	he	would've	blushed,	if	he	had	been	paler.	He	looked down,	adjusted	his	glasses,	and	lifted	his	shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	said,	"Got	to	spend	it	on	someone." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	said,	"Well,	it's	a	pretty	evenin'.	I	feel	like	a	walk." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	and	James	grinned	and	ran	for	their	truck.	"We	owe	you!"	called	James. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Bout	a	million	an'	one,"	said	Mayella.	"Ain'	nobody	paid	me	back	fo' </p>
<p class="calibre1">my	half	o'	that	truck	yet." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though	she	spoke	quietly,	James	heard	her	and	laughed.	"We	will!	We	will!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	and	James	drove	away,	Ma	and	Mayella	returned	to	the	restaurant, Digger	and	I	continued	to	play	under	the	Heart	Tree,	and	Cal	and	Victor drove	by	on	the	highway.	Little	Bit	ran	out	of	the	gift	shop,	looking	up after	the	red	convertible.	I	called,	"They	didn't	try	to	come	in."	She studied	me,	so	I	repeated,	"They	didn't."	Seth	and	James	were	as	big	and as	strong	as	Cal	and	Victor,	and	their	truck	may	have	been	slower	than the	convertible,	but	it	was	more	powerful.	I	wasn't	afraid	for	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p328"></a>Mrs.	Stark	followed	Little	Bit	out	of	the	gift	shop.	"Who'd	you	see, sweetie?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"Car,"	and	went	inside.	Mrs.	Stark	looked	at	her	back, then	smiled	at	me	and	followed	Little	Bit	inside.	Pa	said	Mrs.	Stark wanted	to	be	our	grandma,	but	we	already	had	two	of	them,	and	grandpas were	better	anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Mayella	left	half	an	hour	later,	I	called,	"Night,	Mayella!"	Digger waved	to	her	as	he	usually	did,	but	Little	Bit	ran	to	her	and	gave	her	a hug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wha's	got	into	you,	gal?"	Mayella	asked,	laughing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nuffin." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your	brothers	di'n't	hurt	you	none?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No'm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Cause	if	they	do,	you	just	got	to	whomp	'em	good.	Let	'em	know	they can't	get	away	with	nothin'	no	how." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	pried	Little	Bit's	arms	from	her	legs.	"I	see	you	t'morrow." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	nodded	again.	As	Mayella	walked	up	to	the	road,	Little	Bit whispered,	"Bye." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p329"></a>Early	the	next	morning,	I	swept	the	walkway	around	the	restaurant	all	by myself,	which	was	not	fair.	Little	Bit	usually	did	half,	but	she	had gone	to	Gainesville	with	Ma,	who	had	wanted	company	when	she	went	to	the doctor,	but	not	as	much	company	as	all	three	kids	would	provide.	I	was big	enough	that	I	could	stay	at	Dogland	and	help	Pa.	People	said	I	was lucky	being	the	oldest,	which	showed	how	stupid	a	lot	of	people	were. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stopped	sweeping	when	Sheriff	Donati's	car	turned	onto	the	driveway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sheriff	parked	near	me.	He	got	out,	saying,	"Hey,	Deputy	Chris,	your pa	around?"	He	smiled,	but	he	did	not	sound	like	he	would	like	to	be asked	if	I	could	touch	his	pistol's	genuine	cherrywood	handle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Yes,	sir.	Want	me	to	get	him?"	Ready	to	sprint,	I	dropped	the broom	onto	the	sidewalk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	can	lead	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	walked,	the	sheriff	said,	"Seen	Mayella	Hawkins	today?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	sir."	I	grinned	at	him.	I	liked	helping	adults. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"When's	she	usually	come	in?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	frowned.	"Is	it	nine	yet?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	at	his	watch.	"No." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	don't	get	in	until	nine.	Doesn't,	I	mean." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p330"></a>Pa	had	dug	a	hole	between	two	kennels	to	run	a	plumber's	snake	through	a blocked	sewage	pipe.	The	plumber's	snake	did	not	have	eyes	or	a	mouth like	I	thought	it	should;	it	was	only	a	diamond-shaped	piece	of	steel	on a	long	metal	ribbon.	Pa	smiled	at	us,	set	down	the	plumber's	snake,	and said,	"Rooster.	You'd	probably	be	grateful	if	I	don't	shake	hands	with	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Isn't	a	social	call,"	Sheriff	Donati	said.	"I'm	looking	for	Mayella Hawkins." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	frowned.	"She	isn't	here	yet." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wasn't	at	her	family's	shack,	either.	An'	I	didn't	see	her	on	the	road." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	shortcuts	across	a	field	or	two	when	she	can't	get	a	ride.	Why?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sheriff	looked	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"You	finish	sweeping?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Almost." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Almost	isn't	enough." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	sir."	I	dragged	my	cowboy	boots	in	the	gravel	as	I	walked	away, but	the	sheriff	waited,	then	spoke	too	quietly	for	me	to	hear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Disgusted,	I	ran	back	to	the	restaurant	and	picked	up	my	broom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	I	dropped	it	again.	"Mayella!	Mayella!"	I	cried	her	name	as	I	ran up	the	hill	to	the	highway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	smile	seemed	forced.	"How	you,	Chris?"	She	stood	on	the	side	of	the road,	waiting	for	me	while	she	looked	at	Sheriff	Donati's	patrol	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p331"></a>"The	sheriff's	here.	He's	looking	for	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	Cal	with	him?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head.	"Are	you	getting	up	a	posse?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	wish."	She	looked	at	me.	"Chris,	I	bes'	go.	Don'	tell	no	one	you	seen me,	hear?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes'm.	Why?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shook	her	head,	turned,	then	turned	back.	"How's	that	swimmin'	goin'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh."	I	shrugged.	"Pretty	good." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good.	You	keep	at	it."	She	smiled,	turned,	and	loped	across	the	highway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind	me,	Sheriff	Donati	called,	"Who	you	wavin'	at,	Deputy	Chris?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	and	Pa	stood	by	the	front	door	of	the	gift	shop.	Unable	even	to shrug,	I	stared	at	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Cat	got	your--"	the	sheriff	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	was	talkin'	to	Mayella,"	said	Mrs.	Stark,	pushing	past	the	sheriff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Weren't	you,	Chris?	You	don't	have	to	be	shy	of	Sheriff	Rooster,	you	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Damn,"	said	Sheriff	Donati.	"You	tell	her--	Don't	matter.	That	trail comes	out	back	by	the	bridge,	don't	it?"	He	looked	at	Pa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shrugged.	"Lots	of	side	trails	run	off	it.	She	could	be	heading anywhere." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sheriff	Donati	nodded,	then	trotted	to	his	car.	As	he	backed	out	of	his parking	space,	Mrs.	Stark	said,	"Wha'd	she	do?	I	always	liked	Mayella, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p332"></a>but	black	blood's	weak,	you	know.	Never	tempt	a	nigger,	'cause	a	nigger hasn't	got	a	white	man's	will.	It's	just	how	the	good	Lord	made	'em. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reverend	Shale	says--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Later,"	and	ran	to	our	pick-up	truck.	I	followed.	As	I	opened the	passenger	door,	Pa	said,	"Stay--"	My	heart	dipped	until	he	finished, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--out	of	the	way." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	sir."	I	slammed	the	door,	and	we	took	off	after	the	sheriff.	This was	no	time	to	ask	Pa	questions.	He	drove	as	quickly	as	he	had	when Digger	had	been	bitten.	The	pick-up	was	old,	used	mostly	for	hauling	dog food,	and	had	rarely	been	driven	quickly.	Pa	gripped	the	wheel	with	both fists,	and	we	bounced	high	at	every	irregularity	in	the	road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	trail	that	Mayella	had	taken	may	have	been	an	animal	path,	or	maybe humans	had	used	it	since	the	time	of	the	Timucua	and	the	Apalachee.	It cut	through	scrub	and	forest,	passing	by	Hawkins	Spring	and	leaving	the woods	near	the	bridge	over	the	Suwannee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	highway	curved	from	Dogland	to	the	bridge,	meeting	a	county	road	to Trenton	at	the	center	of	the	curve.	Whenever	we	walked	to	Hawkins Spring,	we	always	followed	the	highway,	even	though	it	was	at	least twice	as	long	as	the	trail.	Ma	didn't	want	her	kids	going	where	they might	be	bitten	by	bears,	boars,	or	snakes.	Though	Pa	laughed	at	those fears,	he	agreed	that	it	was	too	easy	for	kids	to	get	lost	on	the	trail, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p333"></a>and	maybe	end	up	drowned	in	swamplands	or	the	river. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	kept	his	attention	on	the	highway	as	he	said,	"She's	prob'ly	heading home.	Nothing	to	be	gained	by	crossing	the	county	line.	Not	when	the sheriff's	in	hot	pursuit."	We	passed	the	Fountain	of	Youth	Motor	Inn, and	Mrs.	DeLyon,	in	the	courtyard,	shaded	her	eyes	with	her	hand	as	we roared	by.	Pa's	next	word	was	a	low,	quiet	"Damn." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella,	on	foot,	was	a	quarter	of	the	way	across	the	suspension	bridge with	Sheriff	Donati	close	behind	her	in	his	patrol	car.	He	braked	and jumped	out,	drawing	his	large,	dark	pistol	with	its	gleaming	cherrywood butt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	heard	his	"Freeze!"	as	Pa	stopped	our	truck	behind	the	patrol	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	kept	running.	Pa	opened	his	door	and	stepped	out,	yelling, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mayella!	Surrender!	We'll	get	you	a	lawyer!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sheriff	called,	"Listen	to	him,	Mayella!"	She	had	reached	the	middle of	the	bridge	and	was	not	slowing.	The	sheriff's	pistol	fired	once.	I blinked.	The	shot	echoed	over	the	river. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	cattle	truck	had	stopped	at	the	far	side	of	the	bridge.	Sheriff Donati's	pistol	was	pointed	into	the	air.	Mayella	stood	still	with	her back	to	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sheriff	called,	"Don't	make	me	shoot	you,	Mayella!	I	don't	want	to have	to!	I	surely	don't!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p334"></a>Pa	called	quietly,	"Rooster,	you	don't	need	to	shoot	anyone.	You	know--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	jumped	up	onto	the	railing.	A	breeze,	or	maybe	her	motion, pressed	her	dress	against	her	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	be--"	Rooster	shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No!"	Pa	called. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayella	dove.	Her	arc	carried	her	toward	the	sun.	The	bridge	hid	the	end of	her	dive	from	my	sight.	Pa	and	Rooster	ran	to	the	railing	to	stare down	at	the	river.	A	crowd	of	men	and	women,	drivers	who	had	stopped	at either	end	of	the	bridge,	ran	to	stand	beside	them.	I	pressed	through the	strangers	and	their	questions:	"What	happened?"	"That	nigger	crazy?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	tryin'	to	kill	herself?"	"What's	goin'	on	here?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	squeezed	next	to	Pa	and	looked	down.	The	dark	waters	washed	on	to	the Gulf	of	Mexico.	A	speedboat	circled	beneath	the	bridge,	its	driver craning	like	us	all	to	see	what	the	river	might	bring	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pa!"	I	asked.	"Where's	Mayella?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	see	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sh."	He	put	his	hand	on	my	shoulder,	and	we	watched	the	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	wouldn't'a'	shot	her,"	Rooster	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	clapped	Rooster's	arm	once.	Rooster	stood	still	like	a	scarecrow	that had	been	emptied	of	life.	Pa	told	me,	"Come	on." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p335"></a>"But	Mayella--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	isn't	coming	up,"	Pa	said.	"Let's	go." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	she	swims	good." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	been	too	long." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait!	Pa,	look!"	Everyone	stared	at	the	bend	of	the	river,	where	I	pointed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sorry,	Chris,"	Pa	said.	"That's	just	a	manatee." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	see	many,"	said	someone	in	the	crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	wouldn't'a'	shot	her,"	Rooster	repeated.	"I	don't	think	I	would'a' </p>
<p class="calibre1">shot	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	drove	back	to	Dogland	far	more	slowly	than	he	had	driven	to	the bridge.	I	said,	"Pa?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Son?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What'd	Mayella	do?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothing.	She	was	just	born	the	wrong--"	He	pressed	his	lips	together and	shook	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pa?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Cal	Carter	said	she	drowned	Victor	Dalton." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	pick-up	bumped	its	way	down	the	driveway,	and	Pa	parked	on	the	far side	of	the	Heart	Tree	so	tourists	could	park	near	the	gift	shop.	When we	got	out,	Pa	looked	at	me	and	said,	"What	is	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p336"></a>"Did	she?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	moment,	he	said,	"Do	you	think	Mayella	would	drown	someone?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	unless	they	were	bad." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mmm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pa?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	there	was	a	submarine,	Mayella	could'a'	swum	down	to	it,	right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	wasn't	a	sub,	Chris."	Pa	turned	to	face	the	gift	shop,	where	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stark	waited	at	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	there	could'a'--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	wasn't	a	sub!"	Pa	shouted	as	he	whirled	toward	me.	I	stepped back.	My	eyes	began	to	water,	and	I	tightened	my	eyelids	to	stop	myself from	crying.	"Understand?	There's	no--"	He	lifted	one	fist,	then	opened it,	looked	from	his	palm	to	my	face,	turned,	and	strode	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mister	Nix?"	Mrs.	Stark	said.	He	brushed	by	her	without	slowing.	She watched	him	pass,	then	came	into	the	parking	lot.	Extending	her	soft arms	to	me,	she	said,	"Christopher?	Oh,	you	poor	ba--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	spun	away,	ran	around	the	gift	shop,	and	scrambled	through	the partially	completed	fence	that	would	hide	the	dog	kennels	from	the	view of	passers-by.	The	Saluki	and	the	Italian	Grayhound	raced	toward	me	in the	exercise	pen.	I	ignored	them	as	they	bounded	onto	the	wire	fence	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p337"></a>thrust	their	long	snouts	through	the	links. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	northern	working	dogs	noticed	me	next.	I	waited	until	tourists	had left	Captain's	pen,	then	opened	his	gate.	He	jumped	up,	and	I	hugged him.	He	followed	me	into	his	house.	"Frogmen	could'a'	took	her	in	a sub,"	I	said,	and	Captain	licked	my	ear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Captain	decided	he	would	rather	spend	a	warm	summer	day	on	his porch	instead	of	sleeping	in	his	tiny	house	with	me,	he	crawled	out, waking	me.	I	peeked	between	two	wall	slats	and	saw	no	one,	but	when	I poked	my	head	out	the	doorway,	Captain	licked	my	nose,	and	on	the	gravel walkway,	Helen,	one	of	the	guides,	said,	"Now,	I'm	sure	you	folks	think we	have	a	rare	set	of	identical	twin	Norwegian	Elkhounds	here,	but	the one	in	the	cowboy	boots	is	Christopher	Nix,	the	owners'	son." </p>
<p class="calibre1">People	laughed,	and	I	smiled.	Someone	asked	if	all	the	dogs	were	my family,	and	I	said	yes,	and	everyone	laughed	again.	I	squeezed	out	of Captain's	pen	as	Helen	said,	"You	ought	to	fill	in	for	breeds	that're off	to	the	vet	or	that	we	haven't	got	in	yet.	We	already	have	a	Elkhound to	show	folks." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes'm."	Helen	made	me	more	shy	than	any	of	the	women	at	Dogland.	She was	older	than	Francine	and	younger	than	Ma	or	Lurleen.	I	saw	her	as tall	and	broad-shouldered	because	she	worked	with	the	dogs	like	the	men, and	she	ordered	Ethorne,	Seth,	and	James	around	as	easily	as	Pa	did--Ma</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p338"></a>and	Francine	gave	requests,	not	orders.	Helen	was	a	Seventh	Day Adventist,	which	meant	she	did	not	eat	meat	and	she	thought	Sunday	was on	Saturday,	which	was	fine	by	Pa	because	Helen	never	minded	coming	to work	on	Sundays. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Helen	led	the	tourists	away,	I	took	the	path	in	the	opposite direction.	I	poked	my	fingers	in	the	cages	of	all	my	favorite	dogs,	then went	into	the	Doggy	Salon,	where	I	ignored	the	little	dogs	and	sat	by Bo-Peep.	The	English	Bulldog	always	lay	in	the	shade	of	the	Doggy	Salon on	the	hottest	days	of	summer.	He	rested	on	his	side	on	a	rug	before	an electric	fan	and	panted.	Froth	dripped	from	his	lolling	tongue.	That	was how	dogs	sweated,	I	explained	to	two	old	ladies,	and	they	gave	me	a nickel.	After	they	left,	I	sat	with	Bo-Peep,	patting	his	ribs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	and	James	brought	the	Bedlington	Terrier	and	the	Papillon	in	to	be groomed.	James	saw	me	and	said,	"Your	Pa's	wonderin'	where	you	got	to." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	said,	"It's	hard	'bout	Mayella,	ain't	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	seen	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uh	huh." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	really	dove?	She	weren't	shot	an'	fell?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p339"></a>"Tha's	somethin',	I	'xpect." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	dove	good." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	was	always	somethin'	in	the	water.	Ethorne	say	she	got	that	from her	mama." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	'xpect	if	she	had	to	choose,	she'd	choose	the	water." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Maybe	she	came	up	inside	a	beaver	dam,"	I	said.	"Like	Daniel	Boone.	An' </p>
<p class="calibre1">hid	there	till	everyone	left." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ain't	no	beaver	dams	'round	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	spoke.	"Fucking	redneck	sheriff." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	said,	"Mayella	ain't	goin'	t'	be	watchin'	yo'	mouth	fo'	you	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Things	are	going	to	change." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mm	hmm.	Brush	that	poor	dog	a	li'l	more	lightly.	Ain't	his	fault." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	ain't	replacin'	her,"	Seth	said,	but	his	touch	with	the	brush became	more	gentle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ain't	no	one	replacin'	her,"	James	agreed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	both	stopped	talking	as	they	looked	at	the	door.	Pa	stood	there.	He said,	"Susan's	back.	Why	don't	you	two	take	the	weekend	off?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	said,	"You	sure	you	can	get	by?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p340"></a>Seth	said,	"All	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	said,	"We	just	finish	up	with	these	two,	then	we'll	go." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"All	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thanks,	Mist'	Nix,"	James	said	quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hell,"	Pa	said.	"Nothing	to	thank	me	for.	Chris?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yessir?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Find	Ethorne.	Tell	'im	Simmy	and	Abraham	Brown	can	work,	so	he	can	take the	weekend	off.	More	if	he	wants	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	right,	Pa." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	found	Ethorne	at	the	grooming	shed	on	the	far	side	of	the	walking circle.	He	was	humming	a	church	hymn	as	I	approached.	He	looked	up	and smiled.	"How	you	be,	Mast'	Christopher?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	right,	Ethorne." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tha's	good." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pa	says	Simmy	an'	Abraham	can	work,	so	you	don't	need	to." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who's	he	got	cookin'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged.	"Pa	cooks	good." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Man	can't	do	ever'thing	hisself." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ethorne?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	Mayella	coming	back?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p341"></a>Ethorne	closed	his	eyes.	"No,	Chris.	She's	gone	to	a	better	place." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Miami?"	Mayella	had	often	talked	about	going	to	live	in	Miami. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Better'n	Miami.	She	goin'	to	loll	'round	all	the	time,	eatin'	when	she wants	an'	playin'	when	she	wants.	Her	mama	goin'	t'	be	there	to	greet her,	'long	with	all	kinds	o'	kith	an'	kin	for	company.	Ain'	no	need	to feel	sad	for	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Won't	she	miss	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	sure,	she'll	miss	all	of	us.	But	things	got	so	she	couldn't	stay here	no	more,	so	she	done	gone	home." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh."	I	sat	beside	him.	"Seth's	mad	at	Rooster." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	'xpect	he	is." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mis'	Stark	says	they'll	drag	the	river."	Ethorne	glanced	at	me.	"For Mayella,"	I	explained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	won't	find	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"River	keeps	secrets,	same	as	you	or	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why'd	Rooster	chase	Mayella?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tha's	his	job." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	he's	the	sheriff.	He	should	lock	up	Cal." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh."	Ethorne	nodded.	When	I	frowned,	he	patted	my	back.	"Always	take	it easy,	Christopher	Nix.	Tha's	the	secret	fo'	livin'	long." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p342"></a>"But	it's	not	fair!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	it	surely	ain't.	That's	why	takin'	it	easy	is	'bout	the	hardest thing	there	is	t'	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p343"></a>Ethorne	asked	Pa	about	using	the	kitchen	before	he	left,	then	prepared	a batch	of	sweet	rolls.	While	the	restaurant	filled	with	the	smell	of baking	bread,	Ma	said	she	thought	he	was	fixing	them	for	a	church reception	or	a	household	gathering	to	remember	Mayella,	but	when	he	took the	rolls	from	the	oven,	he	gave	them	to	Ma,	saying,	"Eat	'em	while they're	warm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	as	if	she	wanted	to	say	several	things	at	once.	She	settled on,	"Thank	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	shrugged	that	off	with	a	smile.	"I	be	goin'	now.	I	may	be	sayin' </p>
<p class="calibre1">my	farewell	fo'	a	few	days." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Oh,	Ethorne." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	good	lord	gave	us	ways	to	cope	with	the	pains	o'	this	Earth." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	can't	you	see	it's	hard	on	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa,	standing	near,	said,	"Susan." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"But	I	only--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Oh,	I	don'	mind,	Mist'	Luke.	I'd	rather	listen	to	her than	to	some	preacher	who	don'	know	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	After	Ethorne	left,	Pa	said,	"It'd	be	harder	on	him	not	to--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	know!"	Ma	said	so	angrily	that	Pa	jerked	his	chin	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Ma	ran	from	the	kitchen,	Pa	said,	"Christ,	Susan--"	then	looked	at</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p344"></a>me.	"Fetch	Little	Bit	and	Digger.	It's	time	for	another	happy	family	meal." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	was	in	our	bedroom,	hugging	Digger.	She	looked	at	me.	I	said,	"It's lunchtime." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	was	beside	the	house,	pulling	a	piece	of	rope	like	a	snake for	Tiger.	I	said,	"Pa	said	it's	lunch	time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	how	come	you	didn't	come	up	to	the	kitchen	already?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Because	you	didn't	come	to	get	me	already." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tiger's	my	cat." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	know."	She	kept	playing	with	Tiger,	but	when	I	turned	my	back	to	walk up	to	the	restaurant,	Little	Bit	raced	past.	I	ran,	but	she	pushed through	the	kitchen	door	first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	lifted	her	high	into	the	air.	"Pretty	speedy,	li'l	darling."	She laughed,	and	the	kitchen	door	opened	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	released	Digger's	hand	as	they	stepped	inside.	He	ran	over	to	Pa,	who set	Little	Bit	down	and	swung	Digger	up.	Pa	made	airplane	noises	as	he turned	Digger	from	side	to	side,	then	set	him	on	his	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said	quietly,	"What's	for	lunch?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	at	her.	"Hamburgers	and	green	beans." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"French	cut?"	I	said.	French	cut	string	beans	were	my	favorite vegetable.	I	always	ran	ahead	in	the	grocery	aisle	to	select	the	cans	by</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p345"></a>the	pictures	on	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	smiled.	"Yep.	French	cut." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	"Yayy!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lunch	went	well,	except	for	the	usual	moment	when	Pa,	Little	Bit,	and Digger	heaped	ketchup	on	their	burgers	and	I	used	none.	When	Ma	set	the plate	of	sweet	rolls	in	the	center	of	our	table	and	handed	one	to	each of	us,	a	customer	at	the	next	table	said,	"Those	look	good." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lurleen,	passing	by,	said,	"They're	not	for	sale." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	should	be,"	the	customer	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	a	roll	in	my	hands.	It	was	as	soft	as	flesh,	as	warm	as	a	heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tore	a	strip	free,	popped	it	in	my	mouth,	and	mumbled,	"Why'd	Rooster think	Mayella	did	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	at	me	as	he	lifted	a	roll.	"Ever	hear	anyone	say	that	children should	be	seen	and	not	heard?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because	he	smiled,	I	said,	"But	I	want	to	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	swallowed	a	mouthful,	then	said,	"Because	there	was	a	charge	made. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rooster	had	to	investigate	it.	That's	what	the	police	do.	They	find	the guilty	and	protect	the	innocent." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	glanced	away,	then	said,	"Cal	took	Rooster	to	the	body.	Down	one	of the	trails	along	the	Suwannee."	Without	looking	at	Ma,	he	said,	"They might	as	well	hear	it	from	us,"	and	continued,	"Hard	to	ignore	a	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p346"></a>Cal	claimed	Mayella	lured	him	and	Victor	down	there,	went	crazy,	and drowned	Victor." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmmf,"	said	Ma.	"And	where	was	Cal	supposed	to	be?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Said	she	knocked	him	down,	and	he	bumped	his	head."	To	Ma's	disbelief, he	said,	"Could	be.	There's	such	a	thing	as	berserker	strength." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Rooster,"	said	Lurleen,	passing	by,	"has	got	better	things	to	do	than listen	to	the	likes	of	Cal	Carter." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	after	Lurleen,	then	said,	"The	funny	thing	is,	Rooster	said Victor	was	mashed	down	in	a	mud	flat	near	the	edge	of	the	shore.	It looked	like	he	drowned	in	mud.	Would've	taken	more'n	Cal	or	Mayella	to hold	him	down	like	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	do	you	think	happened	then?"	Ma	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah,	Pa,"	said	Little	Bit.	"What	happened?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	know,"	Pa	said.	"Maybe	Victor	was	drunk,	and	he	dove	off	the bank	not	knowing	there	was	a	sand	bar	there.	Maybe	he	was	in	a	tree	and fell.	Or	was	pushed.	We'll	prob'ly	never	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	why'd	Cal	blame	Mayella?"	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	from	me	to	Ma	to	me.	"Maybe	she	wouldn't	do	something	he wanted.	Maybe	she	saw	something,	like	him	pushing	Victor	off	the	river bank	as	a	joke,	maybe.	And	Victor	drowned	because	Cal	didn't	pull	him out	of	the	mud	in	time,	so	Cal	had	to	blame	someone." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p347"></a>"She	shou'n't'a'	run,"	Little	Bit	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	right,"	Pa	agreed.	"We'd'a'	helped	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	put	the	last	of	the	sweet	roll	in	my	mouth.	"No	matter	what." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"No	matter	what." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p348"></a>That	evening,	after	dinner,	we	kids	were	playing	around	the	swingset when	Ma	screamed.	We	ran	around	the	house	to	the	washer-wringer	where she	was	standing.	Pa	arrived	a	moment	later.	Ma	pointed	at	Ranger	and Tiger.	The	kuvasz	sat,	watching	Ma	with	his	head	cocked,	ready	to	be commanded.	The	kitten	had	his	back	to	us	all	as	he	scrubbed	his	damp head	with	a	paw.	Ma	pointed	at	them	both.	"I	saw	them	just	in	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ranger	was	about	to	bite	Tiger's	head	off." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Well,	you	wouldn't	have	to	worry	about	'em	anymore,	then." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Luke!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shrugged.	"Well,	you	wouldn't." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"Ranger	likes	Tiger." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Like	Digger	likes	hamburgers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Really,"	I	said.	"See?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiger	stalked	up	to	Ranger	and	swatted	the	dog's	paw,	tangling	his	tiny claws	in	Ranger's	thick	white	fur.	Ranger	bent	down,	closed	his	jaws around	Tiger's	head,	and	shook	the	kitten	from	side	to	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	I	can't	look,"	Ma	said,	turning	away.	Pa	laughed,	and	so	did	we kids,	and	we	all	laughed	harder	as	Tiger	proceeded	to	the	next	part	of the	game	by	drying	his	ears	with	angry	swipes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	moment,	Pa	stepped	beside	Ma	and	said,	"Damndest	thing	happened</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p349"></a>today."	When	Ma	looked	at	him,	he	said,	"Second	damndest	thing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Negro	family	came	in	this	evening.	I	headed	for	their	table,	but Lurleen	said	she'd	get	it.	I	told	her	she	didn't	have	to,	but	she	just said,	'I	know,'	so	I	got	out	of	her	way.	She	took	the	order,	and	she delivered	the	food	to	'em.	Then	she	said	she	had	to	have	a	cigarette.	I told	her	to	sit	down;	I'd	get	her	an	ashtray." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	smiled	at	Pa,	and	he	smiled	back.	"Well,"	Ma	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"She	sucked	on	that	cigarette	like	a	Weeki-Wachee	mermaid sucking	on	an	air	tube.	She	didn't	say	a	word	until	she'd	finished.	Then she	went	and	asked	'em	if	they	wanted	dessert." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	put	her	hand	on	Pa's	shoulder.	We	all	watched	Ranger	and	Tiger	trying to	decide	who	was	chasing	whom. </p>

<h3 class="sigilnotintoc">Seeking	Plunder</h3>

<p class="calibre1">The	yellow	school	bus	did	not	pass	in	front	of	Dogland	during	the summer,	but	I	watched	the	highway	for	it	most	mornings.	When	Lurleen asked	me	what	I	wanted	for	my	birthday.	I	told	her,	"To	go	to	school." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed,	and	then	her	face	stilled.	"You're	a	good	boy,	Chris." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	day	or	two	later,	I	was	behind	the	restaurant,	playing	cars	in	the gravel	with	Digger.	Pa	came	and	sat	on	the	green	sidewalk.	He	prodded</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p350"></a>tobacco	into	his	pipe,	struck	a	wooden	match	against	the	concrete,	lit his	pipe,	puffed	twice,	then	said,	"Chris,	I	hear	you	want	to	go	to	school." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	kept	pushing	a	little	metal	sportscar	around	the	road	we	had	made. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kids	have	to	go	to	school	when	they're	old	enough	for	first	grade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You've	got	a	year	to	go."	He	watched	us	play,	then	said,	"Some	schools have	kindergartens	for	kids	who're	five." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	Dickison	doesn't.	Their	school	starts	with	first	grade." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Trenton	has	a	kindergarten,	though." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knew	Trenton.	It	was	a	small	town	as	far	from	Dogland	as	Dickison	or Chiefland. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Problem	is,"	Pa	said,	"their	school	bus	stops	a	mile	away.	And Trenton's	in	another	county,	which	means	they	don't	have	to	take	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	if	they	accepted	you,	your	Ma	or	I	would	have	to	drive	you	to	the bus	stop	every	morning,	and	one	of	us	would	have	to	meet	you	there	every afternoon.	It's	mighty	hard	for	either	of	us	to	get	away	now	that	we've let	some	workers	go." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	don't	teach	you	anything	useful	in	kindergarten.	You	won't	learn</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p351"></a>about	reading,	writing,	or	arithmetic	until	first	grade.	That's	when real	school	begins." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	if	you	want	to	go	to	kindergarten,	we'll	do	what	we	have	to	to	get you	there." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	you	want	us	to	do	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	worked	my	lip	between	my	teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	Chris?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	studied	me.	"You're	sure?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well."	Pa	nodded,	put	his	hands	on	his	knees,	and	stood.	"Your	decision." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p352"></a>We	drove	to	Minnesota	early	that	August.	Ma	said	it	was	for	my	birthday, even	though	we	would	return	to	Dogland	before	my	birthday	came.	Pa	said it	was	to	give	Ma	a	vacation.	After	a	day	or	two,	Pa	left	us	in Rosecroix	with	Grandpa	Abner	and	Grandma	Letitia.	He	had	to	get	back	to Dogland	to	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	Rosecroix,	we	played	with	Grandma	and	Grandpa's	Dachshund	and	the kids	of	the	people	who	managed	Grandpa's	drug	store.	Grandma	and	Grandpa had	a	huge	white	house	with	two	stories	and	a	basement,	and	you	could	go out	onto	the	roof	above	the	attached	two-car	garage.	The	back	yard, bordered	by	Grandpa's	roses	and	a	white	picket	fence,	extended	endlessly toward	the	Rosecroix	River.	We	played	croquet	there,	as	well	as	the usual	games	of	hide	and	seek,	chase,	cowboys	and	Indians,	and	Mother,	May	I? </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	night,	Grandpa	showed	us	movies	in	the	basement	on	his	16	mm projector.	Our	favorite	was	about	bear	cubs	that	get	into	a	campsite that	has	been	abandoned	for	the	day.	The	cubs	topple	things	and	break things	and	finally	bring	the	canvas	tents	down	on	top	of	them	before they	run	away.	Little	Bit,	Digger,	and	I	thought	nothing	was	funnier	in the	world.	Grandpa	Abner,	calling	each	of	the	cubs	by	our	names,	would cry,	"Look,	there's	Big	Boy	Chris!	Oh-oh,	Pretty	Letitia	Bette's	getting in	the	ice	cream!	Careful,	Digger	George,	don't	run	through	those</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p353"></a>hanging	clothes	or	you'll	be	wearing	somebody's	nightie	for	sure!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grandma	and	Grandpa	Uvdal	had	a	color	TV,	which	should	have	been wonderful,	but	Grandma	Letitia	always	wanted	to	watch	shows	where	people played	accordions	or	guessed	the	answers	to	boring	questions,	even	if the	shows	were	in	black	and	white	and	a	cowboy	show	in	color	was	on another	channel.	The	only	program	we	all	liked	--	all	except	Pa,	when	he was	there	--	was	Walt	Disney's	Wonderful	World	of	Color. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several	blocks	away,	across	the	Rosecroix	River	and	two	blocks	into downtown,	Grandpa's	drugstore	had	two	rooms,	a	boring	one	for	drugs	and health	care	products	and	a	better	one	for	gifts	like	cameras,	greeting cards,	and	chocolates.	That	room	had	a	rack	by	the	front	window	for paperback	books,	magazines,	and	comic	books.	The	Uvdal	Pharmarcy's	back room	was	dark	and	full	of	cardboard	boxes	and	strange	wonders	like decorations	for	holidays	that	were	months	away.	Next	to	Grandpa's	drug store	was	the	toy	store,	and	down	the	block	near	the	movie	theatre	was the	bakery	that	made	the	best	bread	in	the	world,	cylindrical	loaves	of cinnamon	spirals	cut	into	slices	no	larger	than	a	child's	hand	and	eaten chewy	fresh	or	toasted	crisp	with	a	thick	swash	of	butter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	the	best	place	in	Minnesota	was	Grandma	and	Grandpa's	cabin	on	Lake of	the	Woods.	Thirty	or	forty	small	vacation	homes	made	a	multicolored ribbon	between	the	woods	of	pine	and	birch	and	the	wide	blue-gray	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p354"></a>The	Uvdals'	had	two	bedrooms,	one	for	Grandma	and	Grandpa	and	one	for Ma,	and	a	common	room	that	faced	the	lake.	Its	walls	were	paneled	with pale	varnished	boards,	and	the	kitchen	table	was	built	like	those	in public	parks,	with	two	attached	benches,	except	its	coat	of	lacquer	made it	smooth	to	touch.	Though	the	cabin	had	electricity,	you	had	to	use	a hand	pump	to	get	water,	and	if	you	wanted	warm	water,	you	had	to	heat	it on	an	old	gas	stove	that	had	been	in	Grandma	and	Grandpa's	house	in Rosecroix	before	they	had	gotten	an	electric	stove.	A	huge	wooden	box held	quartered	birch	logs	beside	the	cabin's	stone	fireplace	that	at night	when	you	begged	him,	Grandpa	would	throw	colored	salts	into, making	dancing	sprites	of	purple	and	blue	and	green	and	gold	while	a radio	as	big	as	a	TV	set	and	even	older	than	Ma	played	static-filled music	from	the	faraway	land	of	Canada. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Catercorner	to	the	cabin	was	the	boathouse	where	Grandpa	kept	his fishing	boat.	The	toilet	was	a	room	in	the	boathouse,	which	almost	made it	an	inhouse.	It	was	a	two-holer,	which	Pa	once	said	was	a	sign	of luxury,	which	made	Grandma	Letitia	say	"Umf"	in	a	way	that	meant	Pa shouldn't	joke	about	wealth	or	toilets,	but	Grandpa	Abner	laughed	in	a way	that	said	it	was	all	right.	After	you	used	the	boathouse	toilet,	you sprinkled	white	powder	on	your	number	two	so	it	didn't	smell	as	bad	and so	it	decomposed	faster.	Anything	could	hide	down	there,	or	in	the	dark</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p355"></a>rafters,	so	I	always	did	my	business	in	the	boathouse	toilet	as	fast	as I	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	rest	of	the	boathouse	was	as	wonderful	as	Grandpa's	basement.	A	rack by	the	door	held	two	different	sized	outboard	motors,	a	smaller	one	for trolling	and	a	larger	one	for	racing.	Along	the	wall	were	a	set	of	gray oars	and	more	bulky	orange	lifejackets	than	I	could	count.	The boathouse's	shelves	held	toys,	some	of	which	had	been	Ma's	and	some	of which	had	been	bought	for	us.	We	kids	each	had	tin	sandbuckets	and sandshovels	with	our	names	painted	on	them	in	red	enamel.	Grandpa	had	a second	croquet	set	at	the	cabin,	as	well	as	a	badminton	set,	fishing poles,	minnow	buckets,	tackle	boxes,	a	large	canvas	American	flag	that flew	on	the	tall	white	wooden	flagpole	between	the	cabin	and	the	lake, and	anything	that	had	ever	been	useful	to	have	at	the	lake	during	the last	thirty	years,	and	anything	that	might	be	useful	someday. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	only	permanent	structure	in	the	cabin's	front	yard	was	the	wooden flagpole,	encircled	by	a	rough	wooden	bench.	Its	chalk	white	surface	was always	stained	by	lake	gulls.	When	the	house	was	occupied,	the	yard	also held	two	wooden	Adirondack	chairs	and	a	picnic	table,	larger	and	darker and	more	crudely	made	than	the	table	indoors.	Many	of	the	beach	cabins had	docks,	but	Grandma	and	Grandpa's	did	not.	Large	rocks	had	been dragged	aside	in	the	lake	so	Grandpa	could	land	his	fishing	boat	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p356"></a>narrow	beach	of	sand	and	gravel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lake	of	the	Woods,	a	part	of	the	Great	Lakes,	was	cold	in	the	summer, but	no	colder	than	Hawkins	Spring.	When	you	looked	across	the	lake,	you could	not	see	land.	The	sea	was	like	that,	only	salty.	Sometimes	you could	see	Gull	Rock,	a	boney	island	on	the	horizon,	but	it	had	never	had pirates,	only	gulls,	so	that	did	not	excite	me.	During	low	tide,	you could	climb	along	a	spine	of	rocks	that	stretched	impossibly	far	from shore,	perhaps	twenty	or	thirty	feet.	You	could	even	jump	from	one	to the	next	if	Ma	or	Grandpa	was	along	to	hold	your	hand	and	swing	you while	yelling,	"Careful!"	On	sunny	days,	you	could	run	around	without your	shirt,	and	the	breeze	from	the	lake	kept	you	cool.	On	grim	days, the	waves	drove	in	to	tease	us	with	the	notion	of	storm,	and	that	was good,	too.	Then	we	would	build	the	fire	high	and	watch	the	wind	and water	play	while	we	stayed	warm	and	dry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	my	favorite	photos	of	my	young	self	must	have	been	taken	on	that trip.	I	stand	in	front	of	the	cabin	and	wear	black	sneakers,	dark trousers,	and	a	powder-blue	jacket	with	a	black	cowboy	hat.	A	holster	is on	my	right	hip,	and	in	my	right	hand,	I	hold	a	cap	gun.	In	my	left,	I display	the	cover	of	a	comic	book	titled	Colt	45.	At	first	glance,	my clothes	might	suggest	the	day	was	cool,	but	Digger	stands	nearby, hugging	a	birch	tree	and	watching	with	something	like	envy.	His	trousers</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p357"></a>and	sneakers	are	identical	to	mine,	but	he	wears	a	striped	short	sleeved shirt.	My	jacket	is	the	color	of	the	cowboy's	on	the	cover	of	the	comic, and	I	am	holding	my	pistol	like	the	cowboy	holds	his.	Children	know	that style	is	more	important	than	comfort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rosecroix's	doctor	and	dentist	had	cabins	next	to	Grandma	and	Grandpa's. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	first	morning	at	Lake	of	the	Woods,	when	I	had	been	alone	running around	outside	shooting	bad	guys,	I	stepped	through	the	back	door	of what	I	thought	was	Grandpa	and	Grandma's	cabin.	A	pleasant	woman	stared at	me,	and	I	stared	at	her.	She	seemed	familiar,	though	the	cabin	did not.	She	smiled.	"Hello.	You	must	be	Chris.	You	came	to	visit?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	continued	to	stare. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	should	knock,	you	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	the	rule	when	you	went	to	a	strange	house.	But	what	was	the rule	when	a	strange	house	came	to	you? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your	grandparents	sure	are	happy	to	have	you	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Would	you	like	something	to	eat?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head.	"No,	thank	you,	ma'am." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	too	bad	your	father	had	to	hurry	back	to	Florida." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	began	examining	the	strange	cabin,	trying	to	find	something	familiar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Does	your	mother	know	you're	here?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p358"></a>I	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	maybe	you	should	go	tell	her	where	you	are.	We'll	visit	some	other time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	and	backed	out	of	the	house.	In	the	yard,	between	the	gravel road	and	the	row	of	cabins,	all	different	colors	but	all	similar	in	size and	shape,	I	sought	something	I	knew.	I	found	nothing.	I	walked	toward one	cabin,	then	turned	and	walked	toward	another,	then	darted	between two	cabins	to	be	near	the	lake.	I	saw	no	people.	Chipmunks	hid	at	my approach.	Gulls	screamed	overhead,	advising	or	mocking	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knew	a	dock	stood	in	front	of	the	cabin	next	to	Grandma	and	Grandpa's, but	docks	stood	near	every	second	or	third	cabin.	I	knew	I	would recognize	the	inside	of	Grandma	and	Grandpa's	cabin	as	soon	as	I	saw	it, but	I	had	lost	faith	in	my	ability	to	know	its	outside.	I	did	not	dare knock	on	any	door	or	peek	in	any	cabin	after	walking	in	on	the	strange woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Christopher!"	Ma	called	nearby.	I	turned	and	ran	toward	her	voice.	She stood	in	front	of	a	white	cabin	with	green	shutters	and	green	shingles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	she	saw	me,	I	slowed	down	suddenly,	and	she	laughed.	"What've	you been	up	to,	young	man?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Playing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled.	"Just	so	you're	having	fun." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p359"></a>That	night,	I	woke	on	the	daybed	in	the	cabin's	front	room.	Embers remained	in	the	fireplace.	Their	glow,	a	small	nightlight	shielded	by	a seashell,	and	the	moon	were	the	only	illumination.	I	could	feel	Digger sleeping	beside	me,	and	I	could	see	Little	Bit's	still	form	on	the	couch across	the	way.	Shadows	moved	in	the	wind	outside,	but	if	I	did	not	look at	them,	they	did	not	matter.	The	wind	itself	was	a	familiar	and comforting	sound;	I	doubt	that	woke	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	walked	in	the	passageway	between	the	two	bedrooms.	The refrigerator	opened,	spilling	light	into	the	cabin,	but	I	could	not	see around	the	corner	to	see	who	or	what	was	there.	Then	a	bedroom	door opened,	and	Grandpa	whispered,	"Can't	sleep?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	whispered	back,	"I	hope	I	didn't	wake	you,	Pop-pop." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	isn't	always	easy,	being	an	old	married	lady,	is	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	laughed	softly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grandpa	said,	"They're	good	kids." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	think	all	kids	are	good	kids." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grandpa	laughed,	louder	than	Ma.	"They're	especially	good	kids." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sometimes	it's	tough	to	remember	that.	I'm	really	very	lucky." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grandpa	said	more	quietly,	"Luke	works	hard	for	all	of	you.	Your	mother sees	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p360"></a>"Not	much	else." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	wants	Dogland	to	work	out	for	you.	We	both	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	know,	Daddy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	don't	mind	the	money." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Luke	does." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	shouldn't.	We	know	he's	good	for	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Daddy?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did	you	and	Mimmy	ever--?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	half-question	hung	in	the	air	for	so	long	that	I	nearly	fell	back	to sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	why	we're	glad	to	help	you.	My	parents	helped	us	get	started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's	natural." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No.	I	mean,	you	two	never	quarrel,	and	Luke	and	I--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again,	the	question	dangled.	Grandpa	said,	"Do	you	miss	him?"	If	Ma answered	aloud,	I	did	not	hear	her.	Grandpa	said,	"Do	you	want	to	be	a family?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	course!	But--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	isn't	that	your	answer?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	should	sleep.	You're	not	just	sleeping	for	yourself,	you	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p361"></a>"Yes,	Daddy."	I	heard	them	move	apart,	then	Ma	said,	"Pop-pop?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Suzzy?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good	night." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sleep	tight." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	bedroom	doors	closed,	one	right	after	the	other.	I	thought,	"Don't let	the	bedbugs	bite,"	and	fell	asleep	almost	immediately. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p362"></a>I	don't	remember	the	drive	back	to	Florida	in	the	small	Dodge	that	had been	Ma's	before	her	marriage,	which	Grandma	and	Grandpa	had	given	back to	her	as	a	birthday	present.	Each	morning,	Ma	had	us	take	some	medicine with	our	vitamins,	and	we	were,	by	our	standards	and	hers,	quiet	through the	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	Dogland,	the	first	new	thing	I	noticed	was	Bridget,	an	Irish Wolfhound	who	had	trouble	adjusting	to	Florida's	moist	heat	and Dogland's	concrete	runs.	She	had	been	sleeping	on	the	bed	with	Pa	while we	were	gone.	Now	she	spent	her	days	in	front	of	a	fan	in	the	Doggy Salon	and	her	nights	in	Ma	and	Pa's	room	on	a	mattress	from	Digger's crib.	I	didn't	like	Bridget.	She	was	big	and	awkward,	and	she	slobbered on	your	face,	and	since	she	was	a	wolfhound,	she	might	gobble	you	with one	bite.	I	did	not	learn	until	a	year	or	two	later	that	wolfhounds hunted	wolves	and	were	not	like	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Near	Dogland,	just	across	the	river	from	Hawkins	Springs	and	the Fountain	of	Youth	Motor	Hotel,	a	new	tourist	attraction	was	ready	to open:	Pirates'	Paradise.	Mr.	Drake	told	Pa	about	it,	saying,	"I	never would've	thought	it	possible,	but	I	think	they're	going	to	achive	a	new low	in	historical	accuracy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Huh,"	said	Pa.	"Business'll	be	booming." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p363"></a>"Pirates?"	I	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who's	behind	it?"	Pa	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	know,"	Mr.	Drake	said.	"I	was	away	on	business	for	a	couple	of weeks.	Lumiere	handled	the	paperwork." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Seems	like	you've	been	called	out	of	town	a	lot	lately." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	company's	been	a	little	busy.	Reason	I	opened	a	branch	in	Latchahee was	to	have	time	for	Gwenny	and	myself.	Head	office	hasn't	figured	out that	I've	got	a	smooth	operation	'cause	nothing	at	all	happens	here,	so I	keep	gettin'	called	to	help	when	another	agent's	swamped.	It's	hard	to say	no." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	have	pirates?"	I	repeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	laughed	and	nodded.	"And	a	pirate	ship	you	can	board,	and	a dungeon,	and	a	Spanish	village	that	gets	raided	every	hour	on	the	hour." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wow." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It'll	open	by	your	birthday,"	Pa	said.	"Want	to	go?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"What	else	do	you	want	for	your	birthday?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	driver's	license." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	and	Mr.	Drake	both	laughed.	Pa	said,	"Where're	you	planning	to	drive?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	bus	stop." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p364"></a>Pa	stopped	smiling.	Mr.	Drake,	watching	me,	grinned	even	more.	"Why	do you	want	to	drive	to	a	bus	stop?	Where'll	a	bus	take	you	that	you couldn't	drive?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"School,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	at	his	wrist	watch,	then	at	Mr.	Drake,	then	stood.	"Tell	Susan I	had	to	run	into	town." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sure."	Mr.	Drake	frowned.	"Is	there	something--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nah,"	said	Pa.	"I	shouldn't	be	long." </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	watched	Pa	go	out	to	our	pickup	truck.	As	he	drove	off,	Mr.	Drake said,	"So,	where's	this	bus	stop?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"At	the	Stan'ard	Oil.	Ma	and	Pa	have	to	work	all	day,	but	if	I	had	a driver's	license,	I	could	drive	there	by	myself.	Then	I	could	go	to kin'ergarden	on	the	school	bus." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"You	have	to	be	fourteen	years	old	to	get	a	learner's permit	in	Florida." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	hurried	into	the	restaurant,	saw	us,	and	smiled.	"Artie." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	smiled	back.	"Susan."	After	a	moment,	he	said,	"Luke	went	into	town. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Said	he	wouldn't	be	long." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	man."	Ma	looked	at	me.	"It's	such	a	nice	day.	You	should	be outside	playing." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p365"></a>"I'm	reading."	Lurleen	had	saved	several	weeks	of	Sunday	funnies	for	me, and	I	was	looking	at	the	pictures	at	the	table	next	to	Mr.	Drake.	Prince Valiant,	Dick	Tracy,	and	the	Phantom	were	my	favorites.	Grandma	and Grandpa's	paper	had	Flash	Gordon,	which	was	my	favorite	in	Minnesota, but	the	Dickison	Star	did	not	carry	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	sighed.	Mr.	Drake	said,	"Take	a	load	off	your	feet?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	mind	if	I	do."	She	sat.	The	restaurant	was	quiet	in	mid-afternoon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where're	Little	Bit	and	Digger?"	said	Mr.	Drake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Napping." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They're	little	kids,"	I	explained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah."	Mr.	Drake	glanced	back	at	Ma.	"Good	trip	home?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	laughed.	"A	good	one,	but	a	slow	one.	Phenobarb's	a	wonderful traveling	companion,	but	even	with	that	we	averaged	about	thirty	miles an	hour." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake's	eyes	narrowed.	"Oh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	nodded.	"Probably	wouldn't	be	here	yet	without	it.	The	kids	weren't any	real	trouble,	but	we	were	still	constantly	stopping	to	find	a	lost toy,	get	a	drink,	go	potty,	fix	a	sandwich,	you	know.	A	flyswatter	lying in	view	on	the	dash	helped	the	phenobarb	take	effect." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	swirled	his	coffee.	"The	Victorians,	the	lower-class	ones,	at</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p366"></a>least,	quieted	their	children,	too.	The	drug	of	choice	gave	them	a	name: Gin	Babies.	Imagine	infant	alcoholics	crying	with	the	d.t.s--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Less	enlightened	times." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	was	just	for	the	trip.	Doctor	Jim	--	he's	our	family	doctor	--	gave me	the	prescription	for	the	kids.	He	told	me	how	much	was	safe." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	didn't	mean	to	pry." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	glanced	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	rolled	his	eyes.	"Well,	all	right,	I	did.	Sorry." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	patted	his	hand	just	as	Lurleen	set	an	iced	tea	in	front	of	her.	Ma drew	her	hand	back.	"Ah,	thanks,	Lurleen." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lurleen	looked	at	Mr.	Drake.	"'Nother	cup	o'	coffee,	Mister	Drake?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Please." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lurleen	refilled	his	cup	and	returned	to	the	counter.	Ma	gave	a	tiny laugh,	then	said,	"Is	Gwenny	looking	forward	to	her	last	year	of	school?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mm	hmm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	still	seeing	that	Tepes	boy?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	guess.	Seems	like	they	break	things	off	near	every	three	or	four weeks,	he	disappears	for	a	month	or	so,	then	he's	back	as	if	he'd	never left."	Mr.	Drake	held	his	thumb	and	forefinger	a	quarter	of	an	inch apart.	"I'm	this	close	to	forbidding	her	to	see	him.	When	they're</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p367"></a>together,	she	loses	weight	and	starts	looking	as	bleached	as	a Klansman's	sheet,	but	she's	happy.	When	they're	apart,	she	fills	out	and spends	time	in	the	sun	till	she's	as	brown	as	an	Indian.	I'd	think	she was	happy	if	that	wasn't	when	she	runs	fastest	to	answer	the	phone." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Love	is	strange." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	smiled.	"I'm	tempted	to	demand	he	stay	away	from	her.	Then they'd	elope	and	put	an	end	to	this." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They're	so	young." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	by	local	standards.	Look	at	Francine	Carter." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Francy's	getting	divorced	and	going	back	to	school.	Hadn't	you	heard? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talk	about	living	life	fast." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good	for	her."	He	sipped	his	coffee.	"Seen	much	of	Ethorne?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	hasn't	been	back	to	work	all	summer." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	shook	his	head.	"He	worked	for	my	family	when	I	was	a	boy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Used	to	take	me	hunting	and	fishing.	I	s'pose	he	was	more	of	a	father	to me	than	anyone." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	nodded,	took	a	pack	of	cigarettes	from	his	shirt	pocket, looked	at	them,	then	returned	them	to	his	shirt.	"My	parents	died	when	I was	younger	than	Chris.	Father	was	part	of	the	U.S.	occupation	of	Haiti. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	both	took	sick	and	died	in	Port-au-Prince.	My	uncle	gave	me	a	place</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p368"></a>in	his	house,	but	he	was	a	traveling	salesman,	often	away	and	drunk	when he	was	home." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	sorry." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	be.	He	had	a	good	library,	and	he	treated	me	well.	I	can't	complain." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	smiled.	"So.	What	do	you	think	of	the	South	now	that	you've been	here	awhile?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	like	it,	but	I	won't	ever	get	used	to	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"For	instance?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	attitudes	toward	work	are	so	different.	I	have	a	good	colored woman	for	housework	and	washing	now,	but	she's	the	first	dependable	one I've	found	since	my	girl	I	liked	ran	off	with	that	albino	evangelist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People,	white	or	colored,	down	here	have	absolutely	no	sense	of responsibility.	They	say	they're	coming	to	work	and	don't.	We've	had them	leave	at	noon	and	not	return,	for	no	apparent	reason	as	they	seemed happy	enough.	One	gal	said	her	divorced	husband	was	after	her	kids	when she	didn't	show	up.	She	said	she'd	taken	her	two	babies	and	driven around	the	countryside	all	night	to	escape	him,	so	she	was	leaving	the state.	She	stopped	here	at	six	a.m.	for	her	check.	It's--"	Ma	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--not	Minnesota." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	laughed.	"No,	it	surely	is	not." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p369"></a>Ma's	face	tightened.	"I	shouldn't	go	on	like	this." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	might	have	cause." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	really.	People	are	so	friendly	here.	I	do	appreciate	that.	The	good workers,	well,	they're	as	good	as	any	workers	anywhere.	And	I	can't	say I	mind	the	general	attitude,	except	when	it's	inconvenient.	I	bet	there are	a	lot	fewer	ulcers	here	than	anywhere	in	America." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lot	of	ulcers	get	brought	to	Florida." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bell	over	the	front	door	rang	as	the	door	swung	open.	We	all	looked as	Mr.	Shale	strode	in.	His	face	was	red	and	damp,	and	his	white	hair stood	in	tufts	about	his	head.	He	wore	a	faded	black	coat	over	his chef's	apron.	In	one	hand,	he	carried	a	green	canvas	bag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mr.	Shale!"	Ma	called.	"You	found	our	deposit!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	ma'am,	indeed	I	did." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come	in;	sit	down!	You	didn't	walk	here	in	this	heat?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	I'm	a	lizard."	He	sat	by	Ma	and	Mr.	Drake.	"A	lizard	for	the	Lord. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How're	you,	Artie?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fine,	Reverend,	as	always." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lurleen	called,	"Fix	you	somethin',	Mr.	Shale?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	Lord	provides,"	Mr.	Shale	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"An	iced	tea?	A	Coke?"	Ma	asked,	then	saw	him	nod	and	called,	"A	Coke!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Shale	set	the	green	canvas	bag	on	the	linoleum	tabletop.	"I	thought</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p370"></a>you	folks'd	be	relieved	to	see	this." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	are.	Luke	figured	we'd	just	learned	an	expensive	lesson." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	happened?"	Mr.	Drake	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	Luke	was	talking	with	friends	of	ours	from	New	Orleans	who'd	come to	visit	the	other	day,	and	he	left	the	bank	deposit	on	top	of	their car.	We	didn't	figure	out	what	had	happened	to	it	until	after	they'd	gone." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lurleen	placed	a	tall	glass	of	Coke	and	ice	before	Mr.	Shale.	"Men're lucky	their	most	treasured	possessions	are	attached	to	'em,	that's	all	I got	to	say.	Here	you	go,	Mr.	Shale." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	blushed,	but	I	didn't	know	why. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Shale	took	the	Coke	in	both	hands	and	lowered	his	head	toward	the straw.	"You	are	two	fine	women	in	the	eyes	of	the	Lord." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	waved	that	away	with	a	flicker	of	red-painted	fingernails.	"Was	the deposit	near	your	place?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No.	I	was	walking	and	thinking	upon	the	end.	I	found	your	money	'long side	the	road	'bout	half	a	mile	past	Tom	Hasty's	Truck	Stop." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	unzipped	the	bag	and	ran	a	finger	through	its	contents.	"Looks	like it's	all	here."	She	plucked	a	bill	and	held	it	out.	"You	have	to	take	a reward." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Shale	shook	his	head.	"No,	ma'am,	I	don't,	and	I	couldn't." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	donation,"	Ma	said.	"You	must	be	able	to	put	some	money	to	some	good</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p371"></a>use." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	I	don't	know,"	Mr.	Shale	said.	"The	lord	sends	enough	folks	needing burgers	and	the	good	word	to	meet	all	my	daily	needs.	And	I	don't	need much	when	the	end	is	so	close.	The	signs	are	all	about	us.	The	Commies will	bring	us	to	war,	maybe	over	Cuba,	maybe	over	Berlin.	You	can	see	it coming.	Havoc	has	been	cried,	and	soon	the	dogs	of	war'll	be	let	slip." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"Shakespeare?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Shale	nodded.	"Julius	Caesar.	The	signs	are	everywhere,	if	you	know how	to	look.	I	find	newspapers	along	the	road,	and	the	front	pages	speak of	destruction.	War	with	the	godless	Russians	must	come." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Really?"	I	said,	with	perhaps	a	bit	of	eagerness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	if	we	can	help	it,"	Ma	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There's	only	one	who	can	help	it."	Mr.	Shale	lifted	a	finger	from	his Coke	glass	to	point	at	the	roof. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"One	who	expects	us	to	do	our	best	to	keep	the	peace,"	said	Mr.	Drake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"True,"	said	Mr.	Shale,	and	he	smiled	at	Ma.	"The	lord	led	me	to	your lost	deposit	for	a	reason.	Maybe	he	means	for	your	kind	donation	to	be put	to	his	service."	He	tucked	the	bill	Ma	had	given	him	into	a	pocket of	his	apron	and	looked	at	me.	"How's	Tiger?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Okay,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"He's	growing	up	strong	and	independent,	just	like	my	Christopher." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p372"></a>I	grinned.	"Yeah." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	returned	sometime	after	Mr.	Shale	had	left,	but	Mr.	Drake	had	not.	Ma called,	"Luke,	look!	Gideon	Shale	found	our	deposit." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	grinned.	"I	guess	I	ought	to	pray	with	the	old	coot,	next	time	he asks	me	to." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What'd	you	do	in	town?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just	a	little	last	minute	business	I'd	neglected." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p373"></a>The	ship	at	Pirate's	Paradise	was	far	better	than	any	real	ship	could have	been.	It	was	a	shell	built	on	a	dock	on	the	river,	so	you	could look	over	either	side	and	see	water.	It	had	ropes	and	masts	and	heavy iron	cannon	on	wooden	blocks	that	you	could	sit	on.	Above	the	ship,	on the	tallest	of	the	three	sailless	masts,	flew	a	black	flag	with	a	white skull	and	crossbones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	in	circles	on	the	deck,	trying	to	see	it	all	at	once.	My birthday	expedition	included	Ma,	Pa,	Digger,	Little	Bit,	Mr.	Drake, Gwenny	Drake,	and	Jordy	Greenleaf.	Jordy	and	I	stopped	staring	at	the ship	to	stare	at	each	other.	"Whoa!"	Jordy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah,"	I	agreed.	"Whoa!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"So?	Where's	Captain	Blood?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	behind	us	said,	"Arr,	matey.	Cap'n	Blood's	a	scribbler's phantasm.	Why	d'ye	seek	'im	when	the	boldest	privateer	of	all	walks these	decks,	an'	that	be	me,	Cap'n	John	'Awkins." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	John	grinned	as	though	a	spotlight	should	glint	against	his teeth.	Though	a	small	man,	brown-haired	and	tanned	as	dark	as	some	of the	lighter	blacks	who	worked	at	Dogland,	he	swaggered	like	a	giant.	His short	hair	was	Brylcreamed	back	from	his	forehead,	and	a	golden	clip-on earring	adorned	one	earlobe,	and	his	white	short-sleeved	shirt	and	tan</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p374"></a>trousers	would	have	gone	unremarked	anywhere	in	America	that	year,	if	he had	not	worn	them	with	high	black	boots,	a	red	sash,	crossed	flintlock pistols,	and	a	cutlass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now,	there's	a	real	pirate,"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded,	and	Jordy	said,	"Yeah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Welcome	aboard	me	pirate	ship!"	Captain	John	cried.	"What's	your	name, laddie?	Be	ye	Black-hearted	Bob,	Bloody	Bill,	Dev'lish	Davey,	or Murd'rous	Mike?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Chris'pher." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah!	Christopher,	the	Crimson	Pirate!	Aye,	I've	heard	o'	you,	you scurvey	dog!	You	parked	your	longboat	out	front	and	came	aboard	on	a social	call,	I	hope.	We	pirates	must	stick	together,	eh?	We	only	raid the	Spanish.	And	the	French.	And	the	Dutch.	But	not	each	other,	eh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded,	and	Ma,	Pa,	Mr.	Drake,	and	Gwenny	Drake	laughed.	Mr.	Drake said,	"I	thought	Hawkins'	ship	was	the	Jesus	of	Lubeck." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	John	threw	his	head	back	and	laughed.	"Aye,	was!	Ye	don't	expect a	rover	to	keep	the	same	ship	for	four	hundred	years,	do	ye?"	He	looked at	Little	Bit.	"And	who's	the	pretty	wench?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	Cap'n	Li'l	Bit,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah,	indeed.	Captain	Li'l	Bit.	You	surely	sailed	with	Anne	Bonney	and Mary	Reid." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p375"></a>"No,"	said	Little	Bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"With	Morgan	the	Pirate,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Arr!	Captain	Morgan.	There	was	a	man!	The	glorious	sack	of	Panama!	Ah, men	dreamed	the	dreams	of	giants	in	those	days." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	little	after	your	time,	Captain	Hawkins,"	said	Mr.	Drake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	the	pirate	could	respond,	Jordy	said,	"Was	it	a	big	sack?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	John	nodded	solemnly.	"Indeed,	laddie.	As	big	as	all	Panama." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"C'mon,"	said	Gwenny.	"I	want	to	see	the	dungeon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	ye?"	Captain	John	laughed.	"Careful	what	ye	wish	for,	lassie." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She's	Gwenny,"	I	said.	"Lassie's	a	dog." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gwenny	shook	her	head.	"Thanks,	boyfriend." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	John	slipped	his	fingers	into	his	sash	and	withdrew	several bright	yellow	slips	of	paper	no	bigger	than	calling	cards.	"Here,	take	a bit	o'	plunder	with	ye,	now.	You,	Cap'n--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Jordy,"	Jordy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Jordy,"	Captain	John	agreed.	"And	you--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	Digger,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	dig	that,"	said	Captain	John.	"'Cause	I'm	one	hep	pirate.	Here's	one for	you,	Cap'n	Li'l	Bit.	And	you,	Dungeon	Wench.	And	you,	Cap'n	Chris." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	yellow	paper	had	a	picture	of	a	skull	and	crossbones,	along	with some	words.	"Thank	you,"	I	said,	and	folded	it	to	put	in	my	pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p376"></a>Ma	read	over	my	shoulder.	"It's	for	free	French	Fries." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	right!"	Jordy	and	I	said	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	told	Captain	John,	"I'm	Luke	Nix.	This	is	my	wife,	Susan.	We	own Dogland,	up	the	road." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	John	shook	Pa's	hand,	then	kissed	Ma's,	which	made	her	cover	her mouth	and	smile.	"It's	good	to	meet	you	at	last.	Come	aboard	anytime." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Going	down	the	gangplank,	Ma	asked,	"Having	fun?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	Jordy	said,	"Yes'm,	this	is	sure	grand!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	native	village	consisted	of	a	couple	of	frond-covered	huts	with picnic	tables	beneath	them.	The	dungeon	was	a	small	three-sided	room with	a	skeleton	manacled	to	one	wall	and	a	dummy	dressed	like	a	pirate stretched	on	a	torturer's	rack.	A	second,	empty	rack	and	an	empty	set	of chains	were	by	the	opposite	wall,	where	a	pirate	with	a	red	scarf	around his	head	was	reading	a	newspaper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	approached,	he	set	the	paper	aside,	started	to	smile,	studied	us, then	continued	to	smile.	"Hi,	y'all.	Want	to	get	your	picture	taken	with a	real	pirate?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gwenny	said,	"Dream	on,	Cal	Carter." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	from	Cal	to	me	to	Pa.	She	said,	"Luke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	watched	Cal,	who	said,	"What	about	you,	Chrissy-boy?	I	can	put	you	in the	rack	and	give	it	a	crank	or	two,	just	like	a	pirate	would." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p377"></a>I	shook	my	head.	Pa	looked	at	Cal,	then	at	me,	then	said,	"C'mon,	Chris." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal	said,	"I	hear	business	ain't	so	hot	at	Dogland	lately,	Mister	Nix." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	at	him.	Ma	glanced	at	Pa,	but	he	suddenly	laughed.	"We'll	be around	awhile,	Cal.	Don't	worry	about	us." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	and	Pa	walked	on.	Mr.	Drake	looked	back	at	Cal	and	said,	"If	a	pup barks	at	an	old	wolf	long	enough,	it's	going	to	get	nipped." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	ain't	scared	of	no	one,"	Cal	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	nodded.	"You've	identified	the	problem.	Now	see	what	you	can do	about	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	walked	away,	Little	Bit	smiled.	"We're	li'l	wolfs." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	restaurant,	a	large	place	paneled	with	dark,	timber	planks,	had	long wooden	tables	and	dim	electric	chandeliers.	I	ordered	a	buccaneer	burger and	fries.	Mr.	Drake	told	how	Blackbeard	would	tie	lit	candles	in	his beard	to	make	the	people	he	attacked	think	he	was	crazy.	Pa	said	he thought	that	must've	worked	pretty	good,	then	said	something	about	Cal being	so	concerned	about	Dogland	when	this	place	wasn't	doing	much business	and	didn't	look	like	it	was	going	to.	Gwenny	joked	with	Little Bit	while	Jordy	and	I	wandered	around	the	dining	room,	looking	at posters	for	pirate	movies,	reproductions	of	paintings	of	sailing	ships, and	second-hand	mannequins	wearing	seventeenth-century	clothes	and weapons.	A	black	woman	in	a	red	circle	skirt	and	a	bare-shouldered	white</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p378"></a>blouse	brought	our	food	on	a	tray,	and	my	root	beer	came	in	a	heavy frosted	glass	mug.	It	was	my	fifth	birthday,	and	I	could	not	imagine that	it	could	be	improved	until	Pa	told	me	he'd	gotten	to	Trenton	in time	to	guarantee	that	the	last	available	place	at	kindergarten	would	be mine,	and	he	and	Ma	would	be	happy	to	get	me	to	and	from	the	bus	stop every	school	day.	When	Ma	asked	if	I	liked	that,	I	liked	it	so	much that,	unable	to	speak,	I	could	only	grin. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p379"></a>Early	each	morning,	Ma	or	Pa	drove	me	a	mile	to	the	Standard	Oil	station at	the	end	of	the	Trenton	school	bus	line.	Late	each	afternoon,	one	of my	parents	would	leave	the	business	of	running	a	tourist	attraction	to meet	me.	Sometimes	I	would	have	to	wait	at	the	station	for	our	car	to arrive,	but	I	became	friendly	with	the	old	man	who	ran	the	station,	so the	delays	in	picking	me	up	were	merely	an	extension	in	the	adventure	of education. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	loved	school.	I	have	forgotten	my	kindergarten	teacher	and	most	of	my classmates,	but	I	have	not	forgotten	the	thrill	of	riding	the	bus,	and learning	to	sing	and	color	and	cut	out	traced	figures	on	stiff	paper with	dull	scissors,	winning	praise	from	my	teacher,	my	parents,	and	my grandparents.	I	crayoned	suns	as	large	as	my	paper	and	as	yellow	as margarine.	I	made	stick	men	who	were	pilgrims,	jet	pilots,	and	pirates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	learned	to	cut	on	the	line	and	color	inside	the	line,	to	make	the	sky blue	and	the	grass	green.	I	sang	songs	whose	words	were	meaningless expressions	of	joy:	Frair	uh	jock	ah,	frair	uh	jock	ah,	door	may	voo? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Door	may	voo?	Sing	cock	uls	an	muss	uls,	a	lie	vuh	lie	voe.	Yanky	doodle went	to	town,	London	bridge	is	falling	down,	Mary	had	a	little	lamb, Baa-baa-black	sheep,	have	you	any	wool?	I	plejaleejinced	to	the	flag, and	I	prayed	to	Our	Father	Huart	In	Heaven.	I	played	tag,	catch,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p380"></a>dodgeball.	I	ran	when	girls	chased	me	to	kiss	me,	and	when	they	caught me,	I	rubbed	off	their	kisses	to	rid	myself	of	girl	cooties,	screaming, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ee-yuck!"	while	I	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p381"></a>"Storm's	comin',"	Ethorne	said,	entering	the	kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yep."	Pa	folded	the	morning	paper	and	set	it	aside.	"Hurricane	Donna. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	heard	it	on	the	radio?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	heard." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gonna	be	a	bad	one.	Record	gales." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	put	a	bowl	of	Sugar	Frosted	Flakes	in	front	of	me.	"Seems	like	every couple	of	years,	there's	a	new	record	storm.	How	can	that	be?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	smiled.	"Gets	bad." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	at	me.	"No	school	for	you	today,	young	man." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Aw,	Ma!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They'll	probably	close	the	school	anyway."	Ma	smoothed	her	apron	and smiled	at	Ethorne.	"It's	good	to	see	you,	Ethorne." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	good	to	see	you,	ma'am.	How	you	been?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fine.	Went	to	visit	my	parents	for	a	couple	of	weeks	this	summer.	That was	nice." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes'm,	I'm	'xpect	so." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How's	Seth	doing	at	college?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	workin'	hard,	ma'am.	Which	is	what	I	ought	to	be	doin'	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	laughed.	"It's	been	months	since	we've	seen	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	Pa,"	I	said.	"We	seen	Ethorne--" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p382"></a>Pa's	glance	told	me	to	be	quiet.	We	had	seen	Ethorne	one	evening	in July,	staggering	along	the	highway	with	a	bottle	in	a	paper	bag	in	one	fist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Saw,"	Ma	corrected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Once	or	twice,"	Pa	added.	"We	haven't	seen	Ethorne	in	the	sense	of being	sociable." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	back	at	Ethorne.	"We	had	to	lay	off	some	workers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Didn't	come	for	money,	Mist'	Luke.	That	storm's	movin'	out.	We	ought	to be	gettin'	ready	for	it.	James	is	out	feedin'	the	dogs	already.	You	want to	bring	any	of	'em	in?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	all	looked	at	Pa.	He	said,	"One	advantage	of	building	the	pens yourself	is	you	know	they're	built	to	stand." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"What	about	Checky?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	rolled	his	eyes.	"All	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"An'	Bo	Peep,"	said	Little	Bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	Mickey,"	said	Ma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Any	more	requests?"	Pa	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Captain,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Elkhounds	don't	mind	a	little	water.	What,	you	want	to	bring	them	all	in?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	nodded.	"Uh	huh." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	rolled	his	eyes.	"Maybe	I'll	put	a	cot	for	me	in	the	Doggy	Salon	till</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p383"></a>it's	over." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hurricane	Donna	hit	America's	East	Coast	on	September	6,	1960,	breaking all	records	for	destructive	storms	in	the	U.S.	One	hundred	and forty-eight	people	died	when	Donna	passed	by.	At	Dogland,	the	skies grayed	and	lowered,	and	rain	slapped	the	earth	in	heavy	sheets,	soaking within	seconds	anyone	who	stepped	into	it.	A	new-planted	palm	in	the open	field	in	front	of	Dogland	blew	free	of	the	ground,	and	a	wooden sign	fell	onto	a	customer's	windshield,	but,	as	Ma	pointed	out,	we	had insurance,	and	no	one	was	hurt. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p384"></a>My	delight	in	school	was	recognized	by	my	teacher	or	my	classmates.	I was	chosen	by	whim	or	vote	to	be	one	of	the	crown-bearers	for	the coronation	of	Trenton	High	School's	homecoming	king	and	queen.	There	is a	black	and	white	photograph	of	me	in	a	white	jacket	and	dark	trousers beside	the	other	crown-bearer,	a	dark-haired	girl	in	a	princess's	white gown.	We	are	both	smiling.	When	I	remember	the	photo,	I	am	surprised	by how	healthy	and	clever	and	cheerful	and	willing	to	please	we	appear	to	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	practiced	my	duty	as	a	crown-bearer	in	the	school	gymnasium.	The	girl and	I	had	to	walk	side	by	side	with	the	bright	crowns	balanced	before	us on	crimson	pillows.	Later,	when	we	walked	the	same	route	for	the ceremony,	the	bleachers	were	full	of	students	and	parents,	and	the ceiling	and	walls	were	decked	with	colored	crepe	and	cardboard.	The school	band	must	have	played,	though	I	remember	no	sounds.	I	walked, smiling	and	half-blind,	through	a	wall	of	spotlights	and	flash	bulbs.	My only	thought	was	balancing	the	crown	on	its	pillow.	After	other	members of	the	school	court	took	the	crown,	I	peeked	at	the	girl	beside	me.	She smiled	back.	I	wondered	if	I	would	grow	up	to	marry	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p385"></a>That	Christmas,	the	Nix	family	drove	back	to	Grandpa	and	Grandma's. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grandpa	made	a	skating	rink	in	his	back	yard	and	built	a	slide	by shaping	snow	and	strengthening	it	with	water	that	froze	soon	after	it was	applied.	Though	Ma	told	Little	Bit	and	me	that	we	had	seen	snow	when we	were	babies,	we	thought	we	had	gone	to	a	place	better	than	Santa Claus's	house	at	the	north	pole.	That	belief	was	confirmed	by	Grandpa's Christmas	decorations.	At	his	basement	workbench,	he	had	cut	elves,	a Santa	in	a	sleigh,	and	a	team	of	reindeer	from	plywood,	then	painted them	and	set	them	up	in	front	of	the	house.	The	elves	were	putting lights	and	ornaments	on	a	pine	tree,	and	Santa	was	flying	above	the garage	with	Rudolf's	nose	glowing	red	to	show	him	the	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	did	not	stay	with	us.	He	visited	Grandma	Bette	and	Uncle	John	and Aunt	Felicity,	who	also	lived	in	Minnesota,	and	then,	as	before,	he returned	to	Florida	alone.	I	don't	know	whether	that	was	planned.	In Minnesota,	we	kids	raced	through	a	cycle	of	childhood	illnesses,	chicken pox	followed	immediately	by	mumps.	Ma	thought	we	might	have	included measles	in	the	mix,	but	she	couldn't	be	sure.	We	handed	off	the	diseases so	that	as	one	kid	was	getting	better,	another	was	falling	ill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	were	all	healthy	on	Christmas	morning.	Digger	and	I	ran	downstairs	in our	pajamas	and	bathrobes	to	find	Little	Bit	already	up	and	sorting</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p386"></a>through	the	presents	in	the	large	red	felt	sock	embroidered	with	her name	that	hung	over	the	fireplace.	The	Christmas	tree,	topped	with	a golden	angel	who	brushed	her	halo	against	the	ceiling,	stood	in	the middle	of	a	mountain	of	presents.	I	don't	remember	the	gifts	anymore, but	I	remember	too	many	were	clothes	from	Grandma,	who	always	gave useless	things	like	fancy	sweaters	you	couldn't	play	in.	Grandpa,	Ma, and	Santa	always	included	toys.	Grandma	baked	ham	and	scalloped potatoes,	which	were	wonderful,	and	sweet	potatoes,	which	I	only	had	to take	a	little	bite	of.	After	we	had	tested	all	the	toys	and	eaten	to	the point	of	bursting	(one	of	my	favorite	images	at	that	age),	we	put	on	our snow	suits	and	snow	boots	and	scarves	and	mittens	and	caps	and	waddled into	the	winter,	where	Ma	pushed	us	on	borrowed	skates	across	Grandpa's ice	rink,	and	rode	with	us	down	the	riverbank	and	across	the	frozen river	on	the	sled	that	had	been	hers	when	she	was	a	girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	on	New	Years	Day,	Grandpa	rushed	Ma	to	Doctor	Jim's,	where	she told	us	everything	was	nice,	because	she	got	to	rest	in	bed	all	day,	eat soup	and	ice	cream,	and	listen	to	the	radio.	After	a	week	or	two,	Ma came	back	to	Grandma	and	Grandpa's	house,	but	Doctor	Jim	told	her	she couldn't	travel	immediately.	So	we	learned	a	little	of	the	life	of	a small	Minnesota	town.	Ma	took	us	to	hockey	games,	which	I	did	not	enjoy because	they	reminded	me	that	I	could	not	stand	on	skates	for	long. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p387"></a>Little	Bit	loved	watching	and	yelling,	"Go,	Rosecroix,	go!"	when	the high	school	cheerleaders	prompted	it.	By	the	middle	of	a	game,	Digger would	begin	yelling	too,	laughing	as	noise	and	steam	poured	from	his lips	in	the	cold	arena. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	liked	the	museum	and	the	library,	two	rooms	in	the	same	building	where I	could	walk	in	quiet	wonder.	The	museum	had	cases	of	military	items, guns	and	buckles	and	medical	tools,	and	ancient	photos	and	antique	farm implements.	My	favorite	item	was	a	rusted	revolver,	long-barreled	like	a cowboy's	six-shooter,	that	had	lain	in	the	river	until	it	changed	into	a pitted	reddish-gray	mass	whose	only	value	was	its	mystery.	The	library had	more	books	than	I	had	ever	seen	in	my	life,	and	shelf	after	shelf were	books	with	pictures	and	words	that	Ma	could	read	to	me,	over	and over	again	until	I	gave	in	to	her	suggestion	that	we	take	these	back	and check	out	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma's	favorite	part	of	those	days	may	have	been	the	nights	when	we	went to	hear	the	high	school	band.	She	had	played	the	snare	drum	when	she attended	Rosecroix.	She	pointed	out	each	of	the	band	instruments	to	us, but	she	dwelled	on	the	percussion	section,	telling	us	which	had	been available	in	her	day	and	marveling	at	the	additions,	the	bongos, maracas,	and	a	shining	scratch	tube. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p388"></a>Around	us,	in	1961,	the	United	States	of	America	(which	was	part	of where	I	lived--Dogland,	Latchahie	County,	Florida,	the	United	States	of America,	the	World,	the	Solar	System,	the	Milky	Way,	the	Universe) formally	decided	that	Cuba	(a	tiny	island	near	Miami),	like	Communist China	(a	far-away	island	so	big	that	it	was	a	continent),	did	not	exist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">President	Eisenhower,	who	looked	like	Grandpa	Abner,	left	office.	In	his farewell	speech,	he	said,	"We	must	guard	against	the	acquisition	of unwarranted	influence,	whether	sought	or	unsought,	by	the military-industrial	complex.	The	potential	for	the	disastrous	rise	of mis-placed	power	exists	and	will	persist."	John	F.	Kennedy,	a	handsome man	with	wavy	brown	hair,	became	the	35th	U.S.	President.	He	created	the Peace	Corps	so	Americans	could	help	people	who	were	not	as	well	off	as we	were.	U.S.-supported	Cuban	rebels	were	defeated	at	the	Bay	of	Pigs	by Fidel	Castro's	troops;	Mr.	Castro	looked	like	Pa	with	a	beard.	The Berlin	Wall	was	built,	dividing	a	city	in	Germany	between	the	Americans and	the	Russians.	Ernest	Hemingway,	Dashiell	Hammett,	Gary	Cooper,	and Carl	Jung	died;	Gary	Cooper	had	been	a	movie	cowboy,	almost	as	good	as John	Wayne.	Robert	Heinlein's	Stranger	in	a	Strange	Land	and	Joseph Heller's	Catch-22	appeared	in	print,	but	they	were	books	that	I	would not	know	about	for	ten	or	more	years.	"West	Side	Story"	won	the	Academy</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p389"></a>Award;	Ma	bought	the	L.P.,	which	meant	"long	player,"	which	was	not	like our	kids'	records,	which	were	45s	with	only	one	song	per	side,	like	the thick	75s	from	Ma's	childhood	that	were	still	in	her	bedroom	in Minnesota.	Yuri	Gagarin	of	the	Soviet	Union	was	the	first	person	to orbit	the	earth,	but	he	was	a	Russian,	so	that	didn't	really	count.	Alan Shepard	of	the	U.S.	rode	in	the	first	manned	U.S.	rocket	into	space,	and he	was	a	hero.	Stretch	pants	and	panty	hose	appeared	in	the	marketplace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Far	more	importantly	to	me,	so	did	the	first	issues	of	DC	Comics' </p>
<p class="calibre1">Justice	League	of	America	and	Marvel	Comics'	Fantastic	Four. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p390"></a>In	the	spring,	a	man	and	a	woman	arrived	at	Dogland	in	a	covered	wagon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Its	wheels	came	from	an	automobile,	but	it	was	a	wooden	wagon	covered with	canvas	like	the	Conestoga	Grandma	Bette	had	ridden	in	when	she	was a	girl.	It	was	drawn	by	two	shaggy	brown	horses	with	white	on	their heads	and	hooves,	followed	by	a	black	and	white	goat	on	a	chain,	and	led by	a	white,	three-legged	dog	with	a	black	spot	over	one	eye.	Little	Bit saw	them	first,	but	I	ran	back	to	tell	everyone,	"There's	a	wagon	train coming!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	laughed	when	he	saw	what	I	was	pointing	at.	"You	need	more'n	one wagon	for	a	wagon	train." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn't	care.	I	ran	out	beside	the	restaurant	to	watch	the	covered wagon	roll	down	our	driveway.	The	man	and	the	woman	on	the	driver's bench	were	short,	sun-browned	people	with	thick	dark	hair.	She	wore	a flowered	skirt	with	a	red	gypsy	blouse	and	tied	her	hair	back	in	a	pony tail.	He	had	a	beard	like	dour	men	in	old	pictures,	and	his	hair, curling	around	the	tops	of	his	ears	and	touching	the	collar	of	his	blue work	shirt,	was	longer	than	any	man's	I	had	seen.	I	thought	she	needed	a bonnet,	and	he,	a	Winchester	rifle	and	a	ten-gallon	hat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	the	man	said,	"Whoa,"	and	stopped	the	horses,	Pa	said,	"Quite	a	rig." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	smiled.	"Thanks.	I	built	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p391"></a>"Nice	work." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	you	mind	us	stopping	here?"	the	woman	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	at	all.	You'll	draw	a	few	extra	tourists." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	not	the	purpose,"	the	man	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This	is	our	home."	The	woman	smiled	at	me.	"Would	you	like	to	live	in	a wagon?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I'm	Luke	Nix.	That's	my	boy,	Chris." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	nodded.	"I'm	Joe.	This	is	Mary." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	do	you	do?"	Mary	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fine,	thank	you,	ma'am,"	I	said,	and	everyone	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Would	there	be	a	place	where	we	could	camp	overnight?"	Mary	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	never	mind	a	little	work	in	exchange,"	Joe	added.	"I'm	fairly	handy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"How	about	under	that	old	oak?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary	and	Joe	looked	at	the	Heart	Tree,	then	at	each	other.	She	told	Pa, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bless	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shrugged.	"If	you're	worried	about	tourists--"	He	looked	at	me.	"--or kids	pestering	you,	you	can	park	by	the	woods." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	oak's	fine."	Joe	rattled	the	reins	to	prompt	the	horses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Mary	and	Joe	got	down	from	the	wagon,	Ma	introduced	herself	and Little	Bit.	Lurleen	and	Mrs.	Stark	came	into	the	parking	lot	to	look	at</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p392"></a>the	newcomers.	Lurleen	only	frowned	and	returned	to	the	restaurant,	but Mrs.	Stark	asked	if	Mary	and	Joe	were	real	gypsies,	and	part	of	a caravan,	or	with	the	circus,	or	going	down	to	the	Wild	West	Show	near Ocala,	and	wasn't	it	uncomfortable	riding	on	that	bench,	and	didn't passing	cars	make	the	animals	nervous.	Pa	said	we	should	let	these people	get	settled,	and	then	they	could	talk	about	doing	a	little	work in	exchange	for	a	meal	or	two.	Ma	nodded	and	said,	"C'mon,	Chris." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	help." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary	said,	"We	don't	mind.	If	he	doesn't	get	in	the	way." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	won't."	Pa	studied	the	wagon.	"Must	be	nice,	just	traveling."	He shook	his	head,	told	me,	"Keep	out	of	their	way,"	and	followed	Dogland's staff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	wagon's	back	was	a	sign.	I	pointed	at	it.	"Kay	ee	wye	double-you-" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary	began	to	unharness	the	horses.	"'Key	West	or	Bust.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	know	a	joke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	like	a	good	joke,"	Joe	said.	I	followed	him	and	Mary	as	they	took care	of	the	horses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Okay,"	I	said.	"A	boy	told	his	sister	to	pass	the	pie.	An'	she	said	if he	ate	another	bite,	he'd	bust.	An'	he	said,	'Then	pass	the	pie	an' </p>
<p class="calibre1">duck!'"	When	I	managed	to	stop	laughing,	I	saw	Joe	and	Mary	were	smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	a	good	one,"	Joe	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p393"></a>"Yeah."	Their	three-legged	dog	sniffed	my	hand.	"What's	his	name?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Dog." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	frowned.	Mary	said,	"You	don't	have	to	name	everything." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	patted	the	dog's	head	and	smiled	as	he	licked	my	hand.	"You	could	call him	Pirate." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Could	call	him	lots	of	things,"	said	Joe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pirate's	good,"	said	Mary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"True,"	said	Joe.	"Pirate	it	is."	He	looked	up	and	smiled.	"Ethorne!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	and	Digger	came	around	the	Heart	Tree.	Digger	stood	slightly behind	Ethorne,	peering	around	his	leg.	Ethorne	said,	"How	you	two	been?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good."	Mary	took	his	hand	between	both	of	hers,	then	looked	at	Digger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who's	this?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	Digger,"	I	said.	"He's	only	three." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	do	you	do,	Digger?"	Joe	squatted	on	his	heels.	"I'm	Joe,	and	this is	Mary." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Digger	looked	down	at	his	feet,	I	said,	"Digger	don't	talk	much." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	much	he	needs	to	say,"	Ethorne	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah."	Mary	smiled	at	Digger.	"A	thinker." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	ma'am,"	I	said.	"I'm	the	thinker.	I'm	going	to	be	a	lawyer." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	thinks	today,"	Ethorne	said.	"Thought	you	was	thinkin'	on	bein'	a cowboy,	Kit	Carson." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p394"></a>"A	cowboy	lawyer,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	nodded.	"Ain't	many	folks	meetin'	the	demand	for	that	line	o' </p>
<p class="calibre1">work	just	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	said,	"What's	Digger	going	to	be?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	squinted.	My	parents	and	grandparents	often	speculated	about	what Little	Bit	and	I	would	do.	No	one	had	ever	suggested	what	Digger	might be.	Ethorne	said,	"Whatever	he	sets	his	mind	to." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary	said,	"He	must	be	a	good	friend	of	yours." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	rubbed	Digger's	head.	"Digger	keeps	me	comp'ny	when	I	got outdoor	work.	He	likes	studyin'	what	folks	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"When	I'm	a	lawyer,	I'll	be	rich." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	what	you	want?"	Mary	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	Pa	said	doctors	and	lawyers	made	the	most	money,	and	I	hated band-aids.	"Or	draw.	I	like	drawing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	do	you	want	to	do,	Digger?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	at	her	and	whispered,	"Make	things." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind	us,	someone	spoke.	"I	understand	that."	I	did	not	recognize	the tones	of	pleasure	until	I	turned.	Mr.	Lumiere	stood	by	the	rear	of	the wagon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	dressed	in	a	white	short-sleeved	shirt,	white	slacks,	and	white tennis	shoes.	With	the	sun	setting	behind	him,	his	face	glowed	too</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p395"></a>brightly	for	me	to	look	at	him.	He	spread	his	arms	wide	as	if	he expected	an	embrace	from	someone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary	said	without	moving	forward,	"Why	are	you	here?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Lumiere	let	his	arms	fall	as	he	shrugged.	"To	greet	you	on	your return.	How	long	has	it	been?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	said,	"You	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	must've	expected	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary	said,	"Never	and	always." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Lumiere	laughed.	"Thank	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	not	so	soon,"	Joe	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	hardly	expected	to	sneak	into	the	county	in	a	horse-drawn	wagon?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You've	already	visited	Mrs.	DeLyon?"	When	Mary	and	Joe	did	not	answer, Mr.	Lumiere	squatted	as	Joe	had	to	look	at	Digger.	"So.	This	is Ethorne's	good	friend." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"World's	full	o'	my	good	friends.	My	bad	friends,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Lumiere	rolled	his	eyes	as	he	smiled,	then	looked	back	at	Digger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hello,	Digger.	I	hope	you'll	be	my	friend." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Digger	don't	like	strangers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Lumiere	nodded.	"Yes,	I	remember	you.	But	we	aren't	strangers,	are we?"	When	I	had	no	answer,	he	smiled	again	at	Digger.	"You	see?	Your</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p396"></a>clever	brother	isn't	afraid	of	me."	Digger,	staying	beside	Ethorne,	met Mr.	Lumiere's	gaze,	then	shook	his	head.	Mr.	Lumiere	laughed.	"That's	a brave	boy!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	stepped	behind	Ethorne's	legs.	Mr.	Lumiere	laughed	again,	and then	Little	Bit	came	around	the	front	of	the	covered	wagon.	"It's	not nice	to	scare	Digger." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"There's	a	long	walk	'tween	scared	and	careful." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	continued	to	glare	at	Mr.	Lumiere.	"It's	not	nice	to	make Digger	be	careful." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	have	to	make	anyone	scared	or	careful,	Miss	Little	Bit.	That only	happens	when	I	fail	to	make	them	see	things	my	way.	Sooner	or later,	almost	everyone	sees	things	my	way."	Mr.	Lumiere	asked	Digger, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did	I	scare	you?	Sorry.	I	didn't	mean	to." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"He'd	cry	if	he	was	scared." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary	squatted	beside	Digger	and	hugged	him.	"You're	with	friends." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,"	said	Mr.	Lumiere.	"As	am	I."	He	inhaled.	"This	would	be	a	fine evening	to	ride,	trampling	the	earth	beneath	our	hooves."	He	looked	at me.	"Would	you	like	that,	Christopher	Nix?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled	helplessly	and	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	there's	nothing	for	me	here,"	said	Mr.	Lumiere.	"Now."	He	looked at	Ethorne,	then	at	each	of	us.	"I'll	be	seeing	all	of	you,	sooner	or</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p397"></a>later." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	waved.	"Good	bye!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	watched	Mr.	Lumiere	stroll	to	his	car,	a	large	white	tailfinned convertible	with	its	top	down.	Ma	stepped	out	of	the	restaurant,	and	he called,	"Susan!	You	look	lovely,	as	always." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	usually	responded	to	flattery	by	blushing	and	dismissing	it,	but	this time	she	frowned	and	said	quietly,	"Thank	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Pa	came	out	of	the	gift	shop,	Mr.	Lumiere	added,	"The	sight	of	you makes	all	Artie's	praise	seem	positively	laconic."	He	nodded	at	Pa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Luke.	I	just	stopped	by	to	greet	two	fine	people	I've	known	a	long time.	You	must	ask	them	about	the	old	days,	and	what	they've	heard	from their	son.	Fascinating	story-tellers,	the	pair	of	them." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Sure	thing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Lumiere	drove	away	in	a	cloud	of	white	dust.	I	watched	his	car	race toward	the	old	county	road.	As	he	turned	onto	it,	he	may	have	glanced over	his	shoulder	and	smiled	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p398"></a>When	Ma	heard	that	Mary	and	Joe	knew	Ethorne,	she	invited	him	and	James to	stay	for	dinner.	James	said	he	had	an	evening	planned	already,	but	he much	appreciated	the	invitation.	Ethorne	accepted.	Ma	made	slum	gum,	one of	my	favorite	dishes.	While	she	fried	hamburger,	onions,	and	potatoes, then	stirred	in	a	can	of	string	beans,	a	can	of	whole	kernel	corn,	and	a can	of	mushroom	soup,	Ethorne	and	Pa	pushed	several	of	the	restaurant tables	together,	and	Little	Bit	and	I	put	out	the	silverware,	then	Ma and	Mary	brought	out	plates	of	slum	gum	and	toasted	bread.	Pirate bounced	up	and	down	at	the	front	door,	but	Ranger	came	by,	and	after	the two	dogs	had	established	that	Ranger	could	eat	Pirate	in	two	bites	any time	he	needed	a	snack,	they	went	out	together	to	patrol	Dogland. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	asked	Joe	about	their	travels	through	North	America,	and	Ma	asked Mary	how	she	liked	living	in	the	wagon.	I	listened	to	stories	about people	and	places	and	good	times	and	bad,	and	often	a	name	or	an incident	brought	a	nod	or	a	frown	from	Ethorne.	Ma	asked	Mary	and	Joe	if they	were	beatniks,	and	before	either	could	answer,	Pa	said	they	called themselves	beats,	not	beatniks,	which	was	a	derogatory	name	someone	gave the	beats	around	the	time	the	Russians	launched	their	Sputnik	satellite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said	she	didn't	mean	to	make	fun	of	anyone,	and	Joe	laughed	and	said that	was	all	right,	he	and	Mary	couldn't	speak	for	anyone	else,	but	they</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p399"></a>didn't	call	themselves	anything	other	than	travelers.	Mary	asked	Pa about	his	interest	in	names,	and	Pa	said	it	just	seemed	polite	to	call folks	by	what	they	wanted	to	be	called;	he	always	felt	a	little	sorry for	the	female	suffragists	who	were	remembered	in	most	history	books	as suffragettes,	the	name	their	opponents	gave	them.	Joe	asked	if	Pa	was especially	political,	and	Pa	said,	"What's	so	political	about	manners?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Ma	asked	Joe	and	Mary	if	they	ever	thought	about	settling	down,	Joe simply	shook	his	head.	Mary	said,	"You	can't	go	home	again,	but	you	can make	a	home	wherever	you	go."	After	we	finished	Ma's	slum	gum,	Ethorne went	to	the	oven	and	brought	out	a	pan	of	Brown	Betty	that	he	had	made with	brown	sugar,	a	few	apples,	and	stale	bread. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mm,	good!"	I	said,	rubbing	my	stomach	after	the	first	bite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Glad	you	like	it,	Kid	Kit." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kit	Cat!"	Little	Bit	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kids,"	Ma	said	as	Pa	looked	at	us,	and	we	were	quiet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	asked	Mary	and	Joe,	"Nick	Lumiere	said	to	ask	about	your	son.	Should	I?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	know	why	you	don't	like	that	man,"	Ma	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"You	don'	like	'im	either." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	laughed.	"I	don't	know	why	I	don't,	either.	Seems	half	the	county thinks	he's	the	finest	fellow	around." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mmm,"	Ethorne	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p400"></a>Joe	said,	"Our	son	left	us	a	long	time	ago." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"You	must've	been	very	young	when	you	had	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	so,"	Mary	said.	"He	was	like	your	Digger.	He	wanted	to	make	things." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	looked	at	Digger,	who	was	sleeping	in	Ma's	arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You've	known	Mr.	Lumiere	a	long	time?"	Ma	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	smiled.	"All	my	life.	We	see	him	every	time	we	come	to	Latchahie." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	from	Ethorne	to	them.	"Is	that	how	you	met?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	no,"	Mary	said.	"We	met	Ethorne	through	Mrs.	DeLyon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lots	o'	folks	visit	the	Fountain	of	Youth,"	Ethorne	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	long--"	Ma	began,	but	then	Ranger	barked	several	times.	A	long black	convertible	turned	into	the	driveway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I	put	out	the	closed	sign." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	second	vehicle,	a	new	blue	Buick	LeSabre,	pulled	in,	and	Ma	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	Artie's	car." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	smiled	tightly.	"And	Artie,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	got	out	of	his	car	and	greeted	Captain	John	Hawkins,	who	got out	of	his.	Ethorne	gave	a	little	exhalation	as	Pa	said,	"Guess	we should	pull	up	a	couple	more	chairs.	Good	thing	you	made	plenty,	Ethorne." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	yes,"	Ethorne	said	softly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	entered	first,	with	Captain	John	just	behind	him.	Mr.	Drake glanced	at	Mary	and	Joe,	then	said,	"If	the	sign	in	the	door's	meant	for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p401"></a>everyone,	I'll	turn	right	around." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"C'mon	in,	both	of	you,"	Pa	called.	"Make	yourself	comfortable.	Mary, Joe,	that's	Artie." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	smiled	at	them	and	told	Pa,	"Well,	I	should	warn	you,	I'm	here on	business."	He	indicated	Captain	John,	who	grinned	as	he	watched	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You've	met	John	Hawkins,	your	neighbor	across	the	river?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"We	met.	Didn't	know	that	was	your	real	name." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	aye,"	said	Captain	John.	"Some	say	I	take	after	the	original	John Hawkins,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"That's	so,	Co'nel."	He	held	a	lit	cigarette	which	he	idly rolled	end-over-end	across	the	top	of	his	fingers,	a	trick	he	had	said he	had	learned	when	he	spent	a	long	time	in	a	boring	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	John	laughed.	"It's	Captain.	At	least	until	I	can	open	up Colonel	Hawkins'	Old-Time	Plantation." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma,	crossing	to	the	counter,	said,	"You're	going	to	expand?	Already?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	John	nodded.	"That's	my	intention.	I'm	rarely	thwarted." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mmm,"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Can	I	get	you	some	dessert?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	said	Mr.	Drake.	"I'm	content." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ethorne's	cooking,"	Ma	said.	"He	made	Brown	Betty." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Huh.	I	believe	I	detect	a	hint	of	an	appetite." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p402"></a>Ma	smiled.	"And	you,	Mr.	Hawkins?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Call	me	John,"	said	Captain	John.	"No,	thanks.	I'll	take	myself	off	to the	Roadhouse	shortly,	to	celebrate,	I	hope." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Celebrate	what?"	Pa	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mind	if	we	speak	in	private?"	Mr.	Drake	said,	taking	a	plate	of	Brown Betty	and	a	fork	from	Ma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	had	begun	to	draw	a	cigar	from	his	shirt	pocket.	He	looked	from	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drake	to	Captain	John,	then	said	as	if	daring	them	to	agree,	"You	want to	buy	my	land?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	John	said,	"This	was	Hawkins	land.	What	finer	place	for	my Old-Time	Plantation?	Rebuild	the	Colonel's	home	on	a	grander	scale--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Like	your	ship?"	Pa	grinned,	and	so	did	Ethorne.	Captain	John	flinched slightly.	Pa,	scraping	a	wooden	match	across	the	table	to	light	his cigar,	missed	his	expression,	but	Little	Bit	looked	at	me,	so	I	did	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tourists	like	that	stuff,"	Mr.	Drake	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"When	they	come	around,"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That'd	be	my	worry,"	Captain	John	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	can	tote	that	bale	a	little	further,"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'd	pay	a	fair	price,"	Captain	John	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shook	his	head.	"I	didn't	build	Dogland	to	sell	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	can	offer	top	dollar	now,"	Captain	John	said.	"But	you	can't	expect</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p403"></a>to	hold	me	to	that.	If	you're	interested--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shook	his	head.	"Nope." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Without	even	hearing	me	out?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Luke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I	hate	to	hear	a	man	waste	his	breath." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	this	isn't	a	waste	of	anything,"	Captain	John	said.	"Learning	what doesn't	work	is	never	a	waste." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"An	awful	lot	of	learning	there,"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	laughed,	set	aside	the	dessert	plate,	and	said,	"Excellent work,	Ethorne,	as	always."	He	pulled	out	his	own	cigarette	pack,	offered one	to	Ma,	who	accepted	with	a	smile.	Mary	shook	her	head	at	his	offer, and	Joe	said,	"We	don't	smoke...cigarettes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	lit	his	and	Ma's	cigarettes	with	a	silver	lighter.	Ma	inhaled, then	laughed	and	said,	"Ethorne's	last	name	is	Hawkins,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	and	Captain	John	looked	steadily	at	each	other.	"Just	a	name," </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	John	looked	away	first.	As	he	rose,	he	told	Pa,	"Well.	You	know where	to	find	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"And	you	know	where	to	find	us.	Don't	be	a	stranger!"	After Captain	John	left,	she	looked	at	us	kids	and	added,	"Somebody	shouldn't be	strangers	to	their	beds,	either." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p404"></a>Little	Bit	said,	"We	got	comp'ny." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"You've	already	visited	with	everyone." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	said	Little	Bit	as	Mrs.	DeLyon	drove	her	sports	car	into	the	front yard.	"More	comp'ny." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Adults	are	going	to	sit	and	talk,"	Ma	said.	"You	know	how	boring	that	is." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	shook	her	head.	I	added,	"We're	not	sleepy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"Maybe	you	need	a	bedtime	story." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"We're	not	babies,"	as	Little	Bit	said,	"Okay." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	laughed.	"Then	you	don't	have	to	listen,	Chris." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	reached	into	his	jeans	and	drew	out	a	plastic	bag	filled	with shredded	green	leaves.	"Any	objection	if	Mary	and	I	join	you	in	a	smoke? </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	it'd	make	anyone	uncomfortable--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma's	face	tightened.	"If	Mrs.	DeLyon--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary	said,	"Maggie	won't	object." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Go	ahead.	I	tried	that	wacky	weed	in	the	Navy.	I	prefer	beer myself,	but	your	choice	is	your	business." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Artie,	let's	get	the	kids	to	bed." </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	all	waved	at	Mrs.	DeLyon	as	she	came	in	the	front	door,	and	Little Bit	yelled,	"Hello,	good	night!"	We	hurried	through	the	kitchen,	along the	dark	path,	and	into	our	bedroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	washing	our	faces	and	donning	our	pajamas,	we	heard	another	piece</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p405"></a>of	the	story	about	the	king	and	his	knights.	After	the	king	united	the land	and	made	everyone	equal	before	the	law,	he	grew	sick.	The	wizard told	everyone	that	to	save	the	king,	the	land,	and	the	law,	all	the knights	should	go	on	a	quest	to	find	a	magic	cup	that	could	only	be found	by	the	one	who	was	pure	of	heart.	So	many	knights	rode	forth,	and they	had	many	adventures,	rescuing	maidens	and	being	rescued	by	maidens and	fighting	bad	knights	and	sometimes	becoming	bad	knights	and sometimes	becoming	good	knights	again	and	maidens	became	wives	and	bad women	tempted	good	knights	to	give	up	their	quest	and	knights	died	and maidens	died	and	mostly	witches	and	giants	and	knights	who	were	known	by colors	rather	than	names	died	until	it	seemed	all	of	the	bad	people	were dead	and	the	good	people	were	married.	But	nothing	had	changed	for	the king,	and	his	wife,	and	the	best	knight	in	the	land	who	wanted	to	find the	cup	to	please	the	queen,	and	the	young	knight	who	wanted	to	find	it to	be	as	good	as	any	other	knight,	and	the	king's	son	who	did	not	go looking	for	the	cup,	but	stayed	home	trying	to	find	a	way	to	become	the next	king.	And	the	wizard	who	should	have	been	able	to	fix	everything was	asleep	in	a	cave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	prob'ly	enough	for	tonight,"	said	Mr.	Drake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"More,"	said	Little	Bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	laughed	and	kissed	her	forehead.	"Enough's	enough,	Letitia	Bette." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p406"></a>I	said,	"Did	anyone	find	the	cup?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"You	can't	rush	a	story.	But	I	think	the	point	isn't finding	it.	I	think	the	point's	the	search." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	frowned.	"That's	a	gyp." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	happened	to	the	queen?"	Little	Bit	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"That's	my	question,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	smiled.	"That's	the	next	part	of	the	story." </p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h2 title="Chapter Nine, One Hundred Breeds" id="calibre_toc_12" class="calibre4">Chapter	Nine</h2>
<h3 class="sigilnotintoc">One	Hundred	Breeds</h3>

<p class="calibre1">To	clean	the	dog	runs	in	the	morning,	you	had	to	unlatch	the	front	of each	cage	and	get	inside	without	letting	the	dog	out	while	you	dragged	a heavy	green	hose	that	snaked	in	your	grip	as	cold	water	shot	from	its nozzle.	Latching	the	door	behind	you,	you	walked	up	the	concrete	pen, stepping	in	dry	areas	while	dragging	the	hose	through	the	night's	pee and	dookey.	Around	you,	dogs	would	bark	for	joy	of	seeing	you,	and	for the	promise	of	breakfast.	Because	the	sun	was	just	rising,	its	rays through	the	wire	fence	etched	diamonds	on	everything	they	touched.	Some dogs	would	scamper	ahead	of	you,	and	some	would	watch	calmly	from	their porches,	and	some	would	jump	around	you	or	on	you,	and	some	would	stay down	in	the	main	part	of	the	pen	so	that	as	you	rinsed	their	runs	clean, they	could	dance	and	spin	in	the	spray	of	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p407"></a>After	you	had	hosed	the	five	runs	of	each	unit,	you	squirted	the	gutter at	the	front	of	the	pens	to	direct	everything	in	them	onto	the	curved metal	mesh	that	covered	the	central	drain.	You	tried	to	wash	everything through	the	mesh	into	the	drain,	but	hard	turds	did	not	break	up	easily under	the	spray	of	water,	though	soft	turds	did.	Sometimes	the	holes	in the	mesh	would	clog	with	dog	doo	and	dog	hair	and	pine	needles	and	oak leaves	until	nothing	passed	through.	When	you	managed	to	get	everything onto	the	mesh,	you	could	stop,	turn	off	the	water,	and	move	on	to	the next	five	dogs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	or	Ethorne	or	Ma	or	James	or	Helen	or	some	other	grown-up	would	work with	you,	hosing	one	unit	while	you	hosed	the	next,	and	then	they	would bring	up	a	green	metal	lawn	cart,	lift	the	metal	mesh	from	the	drain, and	dump	its	contents	into	the	cart	by	tapping	the	mesh	against	the cart's	side.	Sometimes	a	grown-up	or	two	would	start	on	the	other	end	of the	path	with	a	second	cart,	and	then	you	could	race	to	the	mid-point opposite	the	grooming	shed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	all	the	pens	had	been	washed,	you	could	follow	as	the	adult	pushed the	sloshing	cart	down	an	uneven	sandy	path	past	palmetto	bushes	and evergreen	brush	to	a	pit	banked	with	sand,	ready	to	be	covered	when	it was	full.	There	the	adult	tipped	the	cart,	and	its	contents	slid	into	a murky,	fetid	pool.	Kids	weren't	allowed	to	go	back	there	alone,	because</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p408"></a>there	might	be	rattlesnakes	or	you	could	fall	in	and	drown,	which	must be	the	most	horrible	way	to	die	in	the	whole	wide	world,	yuck!	Sometimes lizards	would	run	across	the	sand,	and	sometimes	doodoo	bugs	would	roll turds	away	toward	their	homes.	You	would	make	faces	because	of	the smell,	and	you	and	the	adult	would	laugh	at	each	other's	face,	and	then you	would	hurry	away	from	the	dog	dookey	pit,	knowing	it	was	so disgusting	that	it	was	wonderful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	dumping	the	dookey	cart,	an	adult,	usually	Pa,	would	feed	the dogs.	The	dog	food	was	made	from	meat	purchased	twice	a	week	from	a slaughterhouse	where	muscled	men	walked	around	in	bloody	clothes	and	pig carcasses	hung	from	hooks	in	cool,	dark	rooms.	The	meat	was	hauled	in clean	metal	garbage	cans	in	the	back	of	the	old	pick-up	truck	to Dogland,	where	it	was	ground	through	a	sausage	machine:	An	adult	with	a wooden	plunger	as	big	as	a	Nazi's	hand	grenade	mashed	bloody	organs	into the	top,	and	cords	like	raw	hamburger	spiraled	from	the	bottom	into	a clean	wheelbarrow,	where	it	was	mixed	by	hand	with	vitamins	and	grain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	the	dog	food	was	stored	in	laundry	tubs	kept	in	old refrigerators	behind	our	house,	which	was	all	hidden	from	the	view	of the	tourists	by	a	wooden	fence	that	Pa	and	Ethorne	and	Handyman	had	built. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	feeding	time,	every	morning	and	every	evening,	an	adult	filled	a wheelbarrow	with	dog	food	and	pushed	it	around	the	circle,	opening	each</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p409"></a>dog's	door	to	slop	chow	on	the	just-washed	concrete	and	to	give	any medicine	a	dog	might	need.	You	could	follow	if	you	wanted,	but	the wheelbarrow	was	too	heavy	for	a	little	kid	who	did	not	have	the	strength to	push	the	big	dogs	back	into	their	pens	if	they	lunged	for	food	or freedom.	Usually	I	did	something	else,	like	watching	the	flickering black	and	white	images	of	Captain	Kangaroo	or	Shari	and	Lambchop	or Beaney	and	Cecil,	the	Seasick	Sea	Serpent,	or	Felix	the	Cat,	the Wonderful,	Wonderful	Cat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	the	dogs	had	been	fed,	both	in	the	morning	and	the	evening, someone	would	go	around	again	to	hose	the	pens.	Only	the	morning	round called	for	dumping	the	drain	mesh	into	the	dookey	cart.	The	rest	of	the time,	you	could	squirt	out	most	of	the	pens	without	even	going	into them,	simply	by	standing	beside	the	pens	and	aiming	carefully	through the	fence.	When	the	dookey	was	in	one	of	the	inner	runs	and	up	against the	side	of	a	fence	where	you	couldn't	hit	it,	you	could	stand	in	front of	the	cage	and	arc	the	spray	past	the	dookey	to	wash	it	down	into	the drain.	If	it	was	stuck,	you	could	blast	it	directly,	sending	it	scooting up	the	run.	Then	arcing	the	spray	over	it	would	wash	it	down	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	are	many	ways	to	hose	a	dog	turd,	and	in	my	time	at	Dogland,	I must	have	learned	them	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p410"></a>A	thin	young	black	man	limped	up	the	path	around	the	dog	pens	one Saturday	morning.	He	saw	me	and	said,	"'Member	me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Imagine	me	without	the	chin	frizz." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Seth?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	laughed,	showing	me	that	he	had	lost	a	tooth.	"Give	the	man	a	prize." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	in	first	grade	now.	I'm	going	to	school	in	Dickison,	not	Trenton, </p>
<p class="calibre1">'cause	the	Dickison	bus	stops	out	front.	Li'l	Bit's	not	goin'	to	school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn't	like	kin'ergarten,	so	Pa	said	she	di'n't	have	to	go.	But	I'm still	goin'.	You	can't	quit	first	grade,	but	I	woul'n't	if	I	could." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	you	doing?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Reading's	hard.	I	got	a	C	in	reading." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	stick	with	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pa	says	C's	average,	and	none	of	his	kids	are	average." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah,	Ethorne's	a	hard-ass	sometimes	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled	because	he	had	said	a	bad	word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Seen	James?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uh-huh.	He's	this	way."	I	walked	a	pace	ahead	of	him	on	the	path.	"He and	Handyman	are	workin'	on	a	drainpipe." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Great." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p411"></a>"It	got	clogged.	How	come	you're	walking	like	Chester?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	squinted.	"On	Gunsmoke?	Marshal	Dillon's	gimp	friend?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	lips	tightened,	then	he	laughed	hard.	"Yeah,	I	'spect	I'm	fit	to	be some	white	man's	sidekick	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You'd	be	Chester's	sidekick?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	away.	"Out	of	the	mouths	of	babes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Digger	di'n't	say	nothing.	Anything." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shook	his	head,	then	said,	"I	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	how	come?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	broke	my	leg.	A	couple	times." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Does	it	hurt?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Would've	hurt	worse	not	to	break	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	wanted	to	take	a	bus	ride." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ridin'	the	bus	is	fun." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	hear	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	why	would	it	hurt	worse--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey,	never	mind,	cowboy.	Someday	you'll	get	it,	or	maybe	you	won't." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	what	happened?	Huh,	Seth?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Maybe	I	tell	you	later.	Maybe	you	best	ask	your	folks	about	it.	There's</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p412"></a>some	things	adults	don't	like	to	talk	about	sometimes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knew	that,	but	before	I	could	say	so,	I	spotted	James	and	Handyman kneeling	by	a	hole	they	had	dug.	A	shovel	and	a	posthole	digger	stood	in the	dirt	beside	them.	I	yelled,	"James,	James!	Look,	it's	Seth!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	looked	up,	then	bared	bright	teeth	in	his	bony	face.	"Seth!	They let	you	out!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	nodded,	keeping	his	face	still.	Handyman	looked	up	too,	then	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey,	Seth.	Hear	you	found	yourself	some	hard	times." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	nodded	curtly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	life's	an	education	for	us	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"True." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	come	back	to	work	for	Luke?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	nodded	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handyman	looked	at	James,	who	still	grinned	and	still	held	the	wire ribbon	of	the	plumber's	snake.	"Whyn't	you	boys	take	five	minutes	to	get re-acquainted?	I	got	this	here	all	right	for	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	launched	himself	from	his	crouch,	telling	Handyman,	"Thanks, boss,"	as	he	threw	his	arms	around	Seth,	picking	him	off	his	feet	and spinning	him	around.	Seth	said,	"Hey,	stop	it!"	then	laughed	as	James said,	"Welcome	home,	brother!"	Handyman	and	I	grinned	at	each	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	twisted	free,	said,	"Watch	yourself,	bro!"	and	jabbed	at	James	like</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p413"></a>his	hero,	Floyd	Patterson.	James	blocked	him,	and	they	sparred	for	a	few seconds,	throwing	slaps	back	and	forth.	As	James	skipped	back,	Seth stepped	forward,	ready	to	slip	a	hand	past	James'	defense,	but	his	leg gave	under	him,	and	he	fell.	James	caught	him	in	a	hug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	moment,	they	looked	at	each	other,	and	I	couldn't	tell	who	was going	to	cry	first.	Then	Seth	straightened	up	and	grinned.	"C'mon,	li'l bro,	let's	take	the	five	the	man	offered." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah.	Sure	thing,	Seth.	Sounds	good." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	they	walked	toward	the	grooming	shed	to	share	a	cigarette,	I	asked Handyman,	"What	happened	to	Seth?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handyman	shrugged.	"The	boy	got	a	little	uppity.	Schoolin'	does	that sometimes.	But	Latchahie	niggers	ain't	like	big	city	niggers.	Seth's goin'	be	all	right.	James	an'	Ethorne	set	a	good	example	for	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	got	to	the	grooming	shed,	James	was	saying,	"I	'xpect	he's	off fishin'.	He	be	glad	to	see	you	when	he's	back." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sure?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Course.	What	you	thinkin'	on	doin'	now?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Maybe	I'll	go	back	to	school.	Maybe	I	won't.	I	learned	a	heap	in	the last	six	months." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Like	what?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	rolled	his	cigarette	end	over	end	between	each	finger	of	his	left</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p414"></a>hand.	"Want	to	see	it	with	the	other	hand?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	shook	his	head	and	said	solemnly,	"Ethorne	be	real	proud	o'	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	laughed,	and	James	joined	him,	so	I	did,	too.	Behind	us,	Francy said,	"This	somethin'	only	men	can	enjoy?"	She	approached	the	shed	with one	of	our	two	full-grown	poodles,	the	black	male	called	Prince	Charming whose	pen	was	next	to	a	white	female	called	Snow	White. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nudged	Seth.	"Do	that	with	the	cigarette	again." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Later."	He	stood.	"How	you,	Mis'	Carter?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just	fine,	Mist'	Hawkins." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	grinned	at	each	other.	Francy	said,	"I'm	goin'	by	McKay	again, though	the	papers	ain't	come	through	yet." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,"	said	Seth.	"Mis'	McKay." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francy	laughed.	"You	called	me	Francy	'fore	you	left." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nigger	needs	to	show	respect	to	a	white	woman,	don't	he?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	said,	"Seth." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	brothers	looked	at	each	other,	Francy	squatted	to	lift	the poodle.	Seth	and	James	both	reached	for	Prince,	but	Francy,	saying,	"I got	him,"	shook	her	head	and	set	the	dog	on	the	grooming	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Addressing	Prince	Charming,	she	added,	"Don't	I,	handsome?"	Picking	up	a curry	brush,	she	began	working	on	the	poodle	and	said,"I	di'n't	just come	over	to	say	'hey.'	I	come	to	say	I	heard	what	you	done,	and	I'm</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p415"></a>proud	for	you."	As	Seth	blinked	at	her,	she	said,	"It's	s'posed	to	be	a free	country,	ain't	it?	I	figure	folks	can	sit	where	they	want,	if	they paid	for	their	ticket." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,"	Seth	said	slowly.	"Thank	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	I	don't	like	that	beatnik	look	one	bit.	Why	you	want	to	hide	your handsome	face?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	said,	"Huh.	I	di'n't	think	nobody	could	hush	Seth's	mouth." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	immediately	asked	Francine,	"I	thought	you	weren't	workin'	here?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just	weekends	and	when	Helen	or	James	can't.	Weekdays	I'm	at	Dickison High.	Unlike	some	folks,	I	value	an	education." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	said,	"The	whole	world's	an	education." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"An'	schoolin's	part	of	the	whole	world,"	Francy	said.	"I	know	you	could be	a	lawyer	if	you	set	your	mind	to	it.	You	could	do	a	lot	of	good	if--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	said,	"Francy,	he	just	got	back." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	looked	away,	then	said,	"Our	five	minutes	must	be	up	and	then	some. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Course,	Handyman'll	understand.	He	knows	how	we	are." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	and	Francy	looked	at	each	other.	Francy	said,	"Seth?	I'm	sorry	if--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	all	right,"	Seth	said	in	a	way	that	meant	it	wasn't.	"C'mon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Massa's	waitin'." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	brothers	walked	away,	I	said,	"Francy?	Wha'd	Seth	do?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Huh?	Oh,	he	rode	a	bus." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p416"></a>"I	ride	a	bus." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sure."	She	smiled	at	me.	"But	ain't	nobody	bombin'	you	or	beatin'	you or	arrestin'	you	to	make	sure	you're	usin'	the	right	waitin'	room	or	the right	washroom." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	always	use	the	boys.	I	woul'n't	ever	use	the	girls." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	'cause	you're	a	good	boy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	I	liked	being	a	good	boy,	but	it	was	only	satisfying	so	long as	someone	noticed.	Then	I	frowned.	"Did	somebody	bomb	Seth?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No."	She	gave	a	laugh	like	a	cough.	"He	was	one	of	the	lucky	ones." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did	somebody	beat	him?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	know	what,	Chris?	Maybe	you	should	talk	to	your	mama	or	your	papa about	this." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Somebody	beat	him	for	ridin'	the	bus?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	all	right	now,"	Francy	said.	"You	don't	have	to	worry." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	want	to	get	beat	for	ridin'	the	bus." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francy	lost	her	concern	and	laughed	hard.	"You're	white,	Chris.	You ain't	got	a	thing	to	worry	'bout." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh."	I	bit	my	upper	lip,	then	smiled.	"Or	you,	neither." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	right.	I'm	free,	an'	white,	an'	in	a	few	years,	I'll	be	twenty-one." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are	you	going	to	have	more	babies?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	squinted	at	me,	then	said,	"Maybe.	If	I	find	the	right	man.	You	know</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p417"></a>any	two-legged	Prince	Charmings?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Cap'n	John?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed.	"Oh,	sure.	He's	a	bit	old	for	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Seth?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed	again,	even	more	dismissingly.	"No,	I	don't	think	so." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Santa	Claus?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There's	a	notion."	She	set	the	brush	aside.	"I'll	marry	me	a	Santa Claus.	Ain't	Prince	handsome?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head.	"He's	charming." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	reckon	you're	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Francy	left	to	take	Prince	back	to	his	cage,	I	decided	to	walk	the long	way	back	to	the	house	so	I	could	poke	my	fingers	into	most	of	the dogs'	cages.	Near	the	biggest	dogs'	pens,	where	the	Great	Dane,	St. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bernard,	kuvasz,	and	Wolfhound	were,	I	heard	a	harsh	whisper.	"Hey! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Boss-boy!	C'mere!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ranger	looked	at	the	same	time	I	did,	and	he	growled.	Cal	Carter	stood behind	a	clump	of	palmetto	by	the	path	to	the	garbage	dump.	He	had either	driven	or	walked	up	the	rough	dirt	road	along	the	edge	of	our property	to	get	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	called	back,	"You're	not	s'posed	to	come	on	the	property,	Cal!"	But	I didn't	call	too	loudly;	I	did	not	want	to	be	a	tattletale. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p418"></a>"I	don't	want	in!	I	want	Francy!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	moved	closer.	"She's	workin'!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	know	that!	That's	why	I'm	here,	boss-boy.	Go	get	her!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	not	s'posed	to	bother	her	when	she's	workin'." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	c'mon."	He	grinned.	"Fetch	her	for	a	minute.	Fellow's	got	a	right to	talk	to	his	own	wife,	don't	he?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	dunno." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sure	you	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"For	a	minute?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"For	a	minute." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well.	All	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal	laughed.	"Thanks,	Chrissy-boy.	That's	right	white	of	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	returned	to	the	grooming	shed,	Francy	was	clipping	the schnauzer's	toe	nails.	"Hey,	Francy?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	got	a	lot	o'	work,	Chris." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Cal	wants	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	glanced	around.	"Where's	he	at?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hidin'." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shook	her	head.	"Should'a'	guessed.	What's	he	want	with	me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	gave	my	shoulders-to-the-ears	shrug	of	total	ignorance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	tell	him--"	She	looked	at	me,	then	pursed	her	lips	and	shook	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p419"></a>"What?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	tell	him.	Where's	he	hidin'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This	way." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	right."	She	unhooked	the	schnauzer's	leash	from	the	tie	post	over the	dog	bench	and	walked	with	the	dog	beside	me.	"You	don't	have	to	do what	Cal	tells	you,	you	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	know.	He	as'ed	nice." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah,	he's	a	good	one	at	askin'	nice." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	approached	the	woods,	Cal	called,	"Hey,	Francy.	You're	lookin' </p>
<p class="calibre1">pretty." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francy	stopped	ten	feet	from	the	brush,	so	I	stopped	beside	her	and patted	the	schnauzer	while	they	talked.	I	thought	the	schnauzer	was funny-looking	with	her	long	brown	beard,	but	she	liked	me,	so	I	liked	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francy	called,	"How	much	money	you	want,	Cal?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"None,	sugar.	You	know	sometimes	I	just	miss	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	ain't	changin'	my	mind." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"C'mon	back	here,	and	let's	us	talk	where	the	kid	can't	hear." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	got	work	to	do.	Chris	said	you	wanted	a	minute.	This	is	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	minute	with	just	us."	He	looked	at	me.	"Don't	you	got	a	place	to	go, Chris-boy?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p420"></a>Francy	laughed.	"You'd	make	a	piss-poor	father	to	any	chil',	Cal." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Maybe	so,"	he	said.	"But	don't	a	fellow	deserve	a	second	chance? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Specially	under	the	circumstances?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,"	Francy	said	quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your	mama	told	my	mama,	Francy.	I	want	to	do	right	by	you,	as	best	I	can." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My	mama	don't	want	us	gettin'	back	t'gether,	Cal.	She	said	I	never should'a'	gone	back	once	to	a	man	who'd	hit	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Christ,	Francy.	I	ain't	offerin'	for	your	mama!	She	just	wanted	some money,	tha's	all.	But	I'm	tryin'	to	give	you	what	I	should'a'	given	you in	the	first	place."	His	voice	grew	softer.	"I'm	workin'	hard,	Francy.	I saved	up	a	li'l	money.	We	could	take	proper	care	o'	the	li'l	ones." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	gave	you	too	many	chances,"	Francy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"One	more." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	many	times	you	said	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	mean	it	this	time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	many	times	you	said	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Christ,	Francy.	You	can	tell	this	time's	diff'rent.	You	think	I'd	hit	a pregnant	woman?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Men	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	ain't	like	most	men." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	'xpect	not." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p421"></a>His	voice	went	even	quieter.	"What	you	mean	by	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothin'." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	d'you	mean?"	He	stepped	closer.	The	tendons	on	the	back	of	his hand	grew	taut	as	his	fingers	formed	a	claw. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This	is	my	land!"	I	yelled.	"My	land.	You	di'n't	pay	to	be	back	here,	Cal!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	at	me.	"Don't	make	me	hurt	you,	boy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francy	stepped	forward.	"You	ain't	goin'	to	hurt	him,	Cal." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind	us,	Seth	said,	"You	ain't	goin'	to	hurt	nobody	at	all,	Cal Carter."	I	turned.	Seth	stood	quietly	behind	the	nearest	dog	pens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal	said,	"You	ain't	in	niggertown,	boy.	Watch	your	mouth." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	stepped	forward,	then	stopped	as	Francy	looked	at	him,	saying, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Please." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	strolled	up	beside	Seth	and	squinted	at	Cal.	"You	ain't trespassin'	now,	is	you?	Mist'	Nix	say	we	s'pose	to	march	any trespassers	up	to	him,	no	matter	if	they	white	or	Negro." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francy	said,	"He	ain't	trespassin'.	He	just	come	to	tell	me	somethin', and	it's	told.	Ain't	that	so?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal	looked	at	all	of	us,	then	laughed.	"Yeah,	I	reckon	that's	so.	Be seein'	y'all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bye,"	I	called,	then	looked	at	Francy	when	she	didn't	offer	any farewell	to	Cal.	She	was	looking	at	Seth	and	James. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p422"></a>"Work's	a-waitin',"	James	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francy	nodded,	and	we	all	moved	away	from	the	woods.	I	left	them	to their	duties	and	walked	back	toward	our	house.	By	the	fence,	I	saw	three women	come	through	the	Doggy	Salon.	They	stood	in	the	sun,	blinking	and looking	at	the	right	and	left-hand	paths.	Since	all	of	the	workers	were busy,	I	approached	them.	"Hi,	can	I	help	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	said	there	would	be	a	guide	here,"	said	the	girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	guide	you,	if	you'd	like." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	can	guide	us?"	asked	the	younger	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	course	he	can,"	said	the	older	woman,	which	was	enough	for	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	saw	the	littlest	dogs	inside,	but	over	this	way,	we	got	the	next littlest--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Remembering	details	from	the	older	guides'	tours	was	easy.	The	sign	on the	front	of	each	cage	was	enough	to	prompt	my	memory,	and	when	it	was not,	simply	announcing	a	dog's	breed	and	name	was	enough	to	please	the tourists.	They	did	not	want	to	hear	the	history	of	every	dog.	They wanted	to	stroll	around	the	circle	in	thirty	or	forty	minutes,	learn	a few	snippets	of	lore	to	certify	their	entertainment	as	educational,	and see	happy,	healthy	dogs	of	more	breeds	than	they	had	known	existed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	grew	older,	I	remembered	my	young	self	reading	aloud	the	names	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p423"></a>dogs	to	adults	and	thought	the	tourists	were	very	kind	to	pretend	I	had provided	any	service.	But	now	I	realize	that	I	provided	several:	I	let them	know	the	Akita	was	pronounced	A-kee-ta,	and	the	Papillon, Pappy-yon.	I	showed	them	the	dogs	were	safe	by	reaching	into	the	pens	to greet	whichever	one	I	pleased.	I	smiled,	and	I	spoke	politely,	and	I told	them	about	feeding	the	dogs	and	playing	with	them.	I	was	as	much	a part	of	their	visit	as	any	of	our	dogs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	end	of	that	first	tour,	the	younger	woman	gave	me	a	dime.	I	had not	anticipated	that,	but	I	thought	it	was	a	good	idea.	I	said,	"Thank you,"	and	tucked	it	into	the	pocket	of	my	shorts.	And	because	another group,	a	family	with	many	children,	had	come	out	of	the	Doggy	Salon,	I walked	over	to	them	and	said,	"Hi,	would	you	like	a	tour?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	was	finishing	my	third	circuit	with	my	third	group,	I	saw	Pa walking	toward	us.	I	wondered	if	he	knew	about	Cal's	visit,	and	whether I	should	have	told	him	that	Cal	had	been	here,	but	he	looked	at	the tourists,	a	well-dressed	couple	with	British	accents,	and	said,	"Hi.	I'm Luke	Nix,	the	owner.	I	just	heard	my	son	decided	he's	a	tour	guide." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	a	fine	one,"	said	the	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	has	every	making	of	a	gentleman,"	said	the	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	that	evidence	of	natural	southern	charm?"	the	woman	asked	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wanted	to	say,	"No,	it's	spankings,"	but	things	that	made	people	you</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p424"></a>know	laugh	could	make	other	people	sad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	said,	"The	question	of	environment	or	breeding	can	hardly	be answered	when	one	has	the	advantage	of	both." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	true,"	said	the	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said	patiently,	"So,	Chris	hasn't	been	pestering	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	at	all,"	said	the	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	studied	me.	"All	right.	You	can	keep	guiding	people,	but	if	anyone doesn't	want	you	along,	leave	'em	alone." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	hear	you	got	a	dime	from	one	lady." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	"And	a	nickel	from	a	man."	I	wondered	if	that	meant	I	would have	to	give	up	the	money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did	you	ask	for	tips?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head	fast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	ask	anyone	for	a	tip,	got	that?	Not	ever." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	ever,"	I	repeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,"	Pa	told	the	tourists,	"I'll	take	him	away	if	you	want	to continue	on	in	peace." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	he's	been	entertaining	and	informative,"	said	the	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	all	right,	then."	Pa	smiled	at	me.	"I'm	glad	to	hear	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	walked	away,	and	I	finished	the	tour.	Back	at	the	Doggy	Salon,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p425"></a>woman	gave	me	a	dime.	The	man	said,	"You	seem	like	a	lad	who's	been	around." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	sir?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	there	a	place	nearby	that	you	think	especially	nice?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Like	pretty?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	said,	"No,	nice	to	visit.	A	special	place	that,	when	you	visit it,	you	simply	feel	well.	It	might	also	be	a	pretty	place,	of	course." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	told	me,	"We'd	like	to	be	able	to	tell	people	we'd	been	to	the very	best	places	in	Latchahie	County.	Where	do	you	think	those	places might	be?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Besides	here?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This	is	grand,"	said	the	woman.	"But	where	else?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pirates'	Paradise!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We've	been	there,"	the	woman	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	Fountain	of	Youth?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	looked	at	each	other.	"And	where's	that?"	the	man	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pointed.	"Thataway.	It's	got	a	big	sign." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	motel,"	the	man	said	with	dismissal	or	disappointment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	"It's	nice.	We	swim	there	sometimes	when	it's	warmer." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well."	The	woman	looked	at	the	man,	then	kissed	my	forehead.	"Thanks just	the	same." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wiped	my	hand	across	my	forehead	as	I	added,	"You	can	buy	comic	books</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p426"></a>at	the	Winn-Dixie	in	Dickison." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	said,	"I	shall	remember	that.	Thank	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tut.	We	can't	win	them	all."	As	they	walked	away,	the	woman	said,	"What is	it	about	yeast	in	the	States?	You	can't	find	good	bread	or	beer	in the	entire	nation." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"True."	The	man	took	her	arm.	"Sometimes	I	look	at	the	state	of	this young	empire	and	think	we're	well	rid	of	ours." </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	lunch,	I	asked	Ma	what	Seth	had	done.	She	said,	"Maybe	you	should	ask your	father	about	that."	Since	Pa	had	been	in	a	good	mood	the	last	time I	saw	him,	I	went	into	the	restaurant	and	found	him	sitting	at	a	table, smoking	his	pipe	while	reading	Newsweek. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pa?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mm?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wha'd	Seth	do?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	the	page.	"When?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged,	then	said,	"On	a	bus,	some	people	hurt	his	leg." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	set	down	the	Newsweek.	"That's	about	the	size	of	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Damned	if	I	know."	Then	he	shook	his	head.	"In	the	South,	it	used	to	be the	law	that	Negroes	had	to	sit	at	the	back	of	the	bus	when	they	rode one,	and	they	had	segregated	waiting	rooms	and	rest	rooms	at	the	bus</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p427"></a>stations,	which	weren't	kept	up	as	nice	as	the	places	for	the	whites." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Like	at	gas	stations." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Right.	Then	the	U.S.	government	said	that	isn't	fair,	that	they couldn't	have	segregated	facilities	on	buses	or	trains	or	anything	that went	from	state	to	state,	and	everyone	should	get	the	same	service." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	"That's	fair." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	what	I	would've	thought.	And	it's	also	the	law.	But	people	are funny	about	the	laws	they'll	obey	and	the	ones	they	won't.	Some	white people	didn't	like	changing	the	way	things	had	been,	so	they	decided	to ignore	the	government.	So	some	other	people,	whites	and	blacks	both, decided	to	ride	buses	from	Washington	to	New	Orleans	to	see	if	the	U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">government	would	make	the	Southern	states	obey.	They	sat	together	in	the front	of	the	buses,	and	at	the	bus	stations,	the	white	ones	used	the colored	bathrooms	and	the	black	ones	used	the	white	bathrooms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything	they	did	was	perfectly	legal." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	why'd	Seth's	leg	get	broke?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Some	white	people	attacked	them.	Some	of	'em	were	hurt	pretty	bad, worse	than	Seth.	And	then	the	southern	police	arrested	'em." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	they	didn't	break	the	law,	you	said." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	they	didn't	break	the	U.S.	law.	But	they	did	break	some	state laws.	The	U.S.	says	the	states	are	s'posed	to	change,	but	some	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p428"></a>states	haven't	yet." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even	though	they're	s'posed	to?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	right.	Things	don't	get	better	overnight,	Chris,	but	they	do	get better	if	you	don't	give	up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Okay." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	that	what	you	wanted	to	know?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	"Thanks,	Pa,"	I	said,	and	I	ran	outside	to	play. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p429"></a>My	first	grade	teacher	was	a	thin,	leathery	woman	named	Mrs.	Howe,	whom I	remember	as	both	stern	and	compassionate,	a	little	like	Aunt	Hope, Pa's	oldest	sister	who	had	cared	for	children	since	she	was	a	child	and therefore	rarely	let	affection	interfere	with	efficiency.	The	school	day began	with	the	Lord's	Prayer,	followed	by	the	pledge	of	allegiance, followed	by	a	Bible	story,	and	then	the	four	'R's	of	elementary	school, reading,	writing,	arithmetic,	and	recess.	Reading	was	my	greatest challenge.	Mrs.	Howe	tried	to	teach	us	to	recognize	the	sounds	that letters	made,	but	every	letter	made	several,	and	it	didn't	matter	what sound	they	made	when	I	could	not	be	sure	whether	I	was	reading	an	"S"	or a	"Z."	"Saw"	and	"was"	flipflopped	before	my	eyes,	so	Mrs.	Howe	put	me in	the	slowest	reading	group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	met	Mrs.	Howe's	challenge.	Every	weekday	morning	after	Ma	made breakfast	for	me,	I	ate	on	the	counter	in	the	restaurant	while	she drilled	me	with	flash	cards	that	she	had	printed	with	a	magic	marker: Bat.	Cat.	Wall.	Ball.	2	+	5.	7	-	3.	One	day,	when	I	was	looking	at	an issue	of	The	Justice	League	of	America,	I	realized	that	I	had	read	every word	that	had	been	said	by	Superman,	Batman,	Wonder	Woman,	Aquaman, Green	Lantern,	Green	Arrow,	and	J'onn	J'onzz,	the	Martian	Manhunter,	as well	as	their	opponent,	Kanjar	Ro,	the	Slaver	from	Space.	By	my	second</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p430"></a>or	third	report	card,	I	had	moved	from	Mrs.	Howe's	slowest	reading	group to	the	fastest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma's	drills	continued.	Those	mornings	were	our	time	together.	Pa	helped the	workers	prepare	Dogland	for	the	first	tourists,	and	Little	Bit	and Digger	usually	slept	late.	After	breakfast,	Ma	walked	me	across	the highway	to	meet	the	school	bus	to	Dickison.	In	the	afternoon,	the	bus stopped	on	our	side	of	the	highway,	so	then	I	could	run	down	the	slope to	Dogland	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	Dickison	bus,	just	as	on	the	Trenton	bus,	little	kids	sat	at	the front	and	bigger	kids	were	noisier	at	the	back.	Since	Dogland	was	close to	the	end	of	the	route,	and	the	only	kids	who	lived	further	from	school than	me	were	much	bigger	than	me,	I	had	most	of	the	bus	to	myself	when it	was	near	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	trip	to	and	from	school	took	us	along	Highway	13	to	a	short	road that	joined	with	the	old	county	road.	Ronnie	Corbin,	one	of	my	best friends,	lived	there	in	a	trailer	house,	perhaps	two	miles	from	Dogland. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	usually	sat	with	me	on	the	firm	bench	seat	for	the	rest	of	the	ride. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ronnie	was	smaller	than	I,	and	he	wore	glasses.	In	our	schoolbook pictures,	he	looks	like	a	quiet,	studious	boy,	but	he	liked	to	laugh	as much	as	I	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	one	lived	on	the	old	county	road,	so	the	bus	only	followed	it	for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p431"></a>half	a	mile	to	another	asphalt	county	road	that	took	us	back	to	Highway 13	at	the	outskirts	of	Dickison.	Along	that	road,	too	far	back	to	be seen,	was	the	farm	where	Dorrie	and	Wayne	Lawson	lived.	I	always	looked away	from	them	when	they	boarded	at	the	dusty	road	back	to	their	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	both	loud	and	dirty	and	poorly	dressed,	and	they	didn't	mind pushing	or	hitting	anyone	they	wanted	to.	Wayne	Lawson	was	one	year ahead	of	me	in	school,	but	two	years	older	because	he	had	been	held	back a	grade.	Dorrie	Lawson	was	in	my	grade	but	not	in	my	class;	Dickison Public	School's	elementary	division	was	large	enough	to	have	two	classes for	each	grade.	We	called	her	Dorrie	Doodoo,	but	never	when	she	was near.	She	could	beat	up	any	boy	in	first	grade	and	most	boys	in	second. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	never	had	a	nickname	for	Wayne	Lawson.	It	would	have	been	too dangerous.	Looking	funny	at	Wayne	Lawson	was	enough	to	get	you	hit.	If you	were	stupid	enough	to	call	Wayne	Lawson	a	name	and	he	overheard	you, your	time	on	the	school	bus	would	be	an	unending	torment	of	loudly whispered	bad	names,	jabs	in	the	arm,	ostensibly	accidental	trippings when	either	of	you	passed,	and	spitballs	when	you	and	the	bus	driver were	not	looking.	Bullies	and	politicians	understand	the	importance	of deniability. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Besides	Ronnie	Corbin	at	school	and	Jordy	Greenleaf	at	Dogland,	my	best friends	were	two	girls	in	my	grade	who	lived	close	to	Dickison.	Pam</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p432"></a>Hutchins	was	blond.	Her	parents'	farm	was	more	prosperous	than	the Lawsons',	and	her	name	spelled	backwards	was	"map."	Roxie	Westly	was brunette.	Her	father	was	a	dentist	or	an	accountant,	a	professional whose	income	let	her	family	live	in	a	new	ranch-style	house	near	the county	road	with	a	lawn	that	was	always	watered	and	mowed.	Her	name	with its	"x"	was	strange	and	exotic.	I	thought	of	Pam	and	Roxie	like	Betty and	Veronica	in	the	Archie	comic	books.	Like	Archie,	I	could	never decide	which	one	I	liked	best. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pam,	Roxie,	Ronnie,	and	I	were	good	students,	the	sort	who	usually	got</p>
<p class="calibre1">"A"s	and	"B"s	on	their	report	cards	and	who	might	get	all	"A"s	once	or twice	a	year.	None	of	us	were	our	class's	best	students,	or	perhaps	we took	turns	being	the	best,	or	perhaps	there	were	some	brilliant	or driven	kids	who	consistently	did	better	than	anyone	else	and	I've forgotten	their	names.	Or	perhaps	one	of	the	four	of	us	was	consistently the	best,	and	none	of	us	noticed	because	the	point	of	doing	well	was	to satisfy	our	parents	and	teachers,	not	to	compete	with	our	friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	kindergarten	at	Trenton,	the	girls	had	chased	the	boys	and	kissed them,	but	in	first	grade	at	Dickison,	the	boys	chased	the	girls,	and	the girls	acted	like	they	hated	it.	I	preferred	being	pursued,	but	I	did	not understand	the	rules	well	enough	to	try	to	change	them.	For	the	most part,	the	boys	and	the	girls	played	their	games	apart.	I	would	not	play</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p433"></a>the	girl's	games,	because	I	did	not	want	to	get	cooties	anymore	than	the next	boy,	but	I	hated	boy's	team	games	like	softball	and	touch	football. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	always	among	the	last	to	be	picked	because	I	threw	balls	and	swung bats	awkwardly,	and	I	could	not	catch.	I	was	always	afraid	someone	would say	I	played	like	a	girl.	At	Dogland	when	no	one	was	around,	I	flung rocks	into	the	woods	to	try	to	figure	out	how	my	arms	and	shoulders	and hips	should	be	moving,	but	thinking	about	it	made	it	worse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	liked	games	where	you	ran.	I	remember	a	large	oak	in	the	corner	of	the playground	that	had	divided	near	to	the	ground	so	you	could	climb	into its	crotch.	It	was	the	perfect	tree	to	tag	in	games	that	required	a base,	and	a	fine	tree	in	which	to	be	a	sharpshooter.	I	liked	dodgeball because	I	could	dodge	well,	and	because	you	thrust	the	ball	from	your chest	with	both	hands,	and	if	you	missed	your	target,	everyone	thought your	target	had	done	well	rather	than	you	had	done	poorly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	liked	talking	on	the	playground.	Dickison	Public	School,	like	most Florida	public	schools,	was	still	segregated	in	the	early	'60s,	so	we would	talk	about	whether	Negroes	were	real	people,	and	whether	they should	go	to	school	with	whites.	We	had	all	heard	our	parents	arguing with	the	television	set,	and	we	all	knew	our	parents	were	correct.	In our	arguments	about	the	nature	of	the	world,	we	could	summarize	our disagreements	without	changing	our	opinions	of	each	other.	We	did	not</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p434"></a>believe	the	world	could	affect	us,	or	we	could	affect	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p435"></a>Mr.	Drake	was	eating	a	grilled	cheese	sandwich	at	the	counter	of Dogland's	restaurant	one	afternoon	and	I	was	having	a	glass	of	milk	when a	stout	man	in	a	gray	suit	walked	in.	He	and	Mr.	Drake	looked	at	each other,	looked	away,	and	then	the	man	laughed	and	approached	Mr.	Drake with	his	hand	extended.	"Artie!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	smiled,	stood,	and	took	the	man's	hand.	"Dmitri,	you	old	dog! </p>
<p class="calibre1">How've	you	been?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well.	You	get	one	word	only	for	answer,	or	you	get	novel	thick	enough to	make	Tolstoy	proud." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	amazed.	And	delighted.	Are	you	staying	around	here?	I'll	take	the novel,	if	you've	got	the	time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"For	tonight,	I	am	at	motel."	Dmitri	turned	his	chin	in	the	direction	of the	Fountain	of	Youth.	"Tomorrow,	I	travel	to	Miami." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sit	down,	man.	You're	here	as--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Visitor."	Dmitri	sat	between	Mr.	Drake	and	me,	and	laughed.	"Actually, I	could	mail	you	true	novel,	which	is	story	not	of	my	life	but	of	my mind.	Except	it	is	not	translated,	so	it	would	not	do	you	good." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	could?	That's	great.	You're	really	a	writer	now?	You	always	said--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dmitri	nodded.	"That	is	why	I	am	here.	I	am	writing	essays	about integration." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p436"></a>"Oh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fiction	does	not	pay	well	in	my	country.	Is	not	so	different	here	in America,	I	understand." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	shrugged.	"Just	traveling?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes.	To	compare	your	north	with	your	south,	your	east	with	your	west. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thirty	days	to	comprehend	America!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	both	laughed.	Mr.	Drake	asked,	"Taking	lots	of	pictures?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dmitri	shrugged.	"Of	course.	I	must	show	that	as	your	wealthiest	are much	richer	than	we,	your	poorest	are	much	poorer." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	waggled	a	finger	at	him.	"Are	we	likely	to	convert	each	other now?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	asked." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guilty.	What	kind	of	fiction?	World	War	II	tales?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Spy	stories." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Like	Ian	Fleming?	Kennedy	told	a	reporter	he	liked	the	Bond	books,	and now	Hollywood's	making	a	movie." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dmitri	nodded.	"I	must	send	your	president	my	next	novel.	This	is	your	son?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	looked	at	me.	Mr.	Drake	said,	"No,	that's	Chris	Nix.	This--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Call	me	Dmitri." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	"Hello,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come	to	my	place	for	supper,"	Mr.	Drake	told	Dmitri.	"You	can	meet	my</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p437"></a>daughter." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'd	like	that	very	much." </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	chance	to	enter	the	conversation	had	passed,	so	I	returned	to	my	copy of	Ranger	Rick's.	A	subscription	had	been	one	of	my	birthday	presents from	Grandpa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"Essays	and	novels." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dmitri	nodded.	"Someone	must." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothing	else?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dmitri	shrugged.	"A	bit	of	a	vacation	is	a	great	deal	else.	It	is,	ah, perquisite." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	knew	I	was	here?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In	Latchahie	County,	yes,	of	course.	You	mentioned	your	home	so	many times	during	war.	In	this	restaurant,	no.	I	hoped	to	surprise	you,	but	I did	not	expect	to	surprise	you	so	soon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"One	of	our	British	friends	was	by	recently.	Purely	on	vacation.	Jack's getting	older,	but	his	women	aren't." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	missed	him?	Perhaps	it's	just	as	well.	I	must	stop	in	London	when	I am	flying	home." </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	moment	of	silence,	Mr.	Drake	said,	"A	writer." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	writer,"	Dmitri	agreed.	"And	you,	an	insurance	agent.	Who	would	have believed	this?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p438"></a>Mr.	Drake	shrugged.	Lurleen,	who	had	been	busy	with	a	family	in	the	far corner,	came,	and	Dmitri	ordered	a	Coke.	After	Lurleen	had	given	it	to him,	Mr.	Drake	said,	"What	do	you	make	of	Berlin?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	would	not	know,	of	course.	But	I	believe	the	tanks	will	withdraw.	We did	not	think	you	would	spend	so	much	money	to	hold	your	half	of	the	city." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	the	wall	dividing	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	must	stand,	now	that	it	is	there.	We	are	both	fond	of	dignity.	But Berlin--"	Dmitri	shook	his	head.	"I	do	not	think	Berlin	will	be	the battlefield.	America	knows	to	fight	its	wars	far	from	the	homeland.	We have	learned	that	lesson,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"You	must've	heard	we're	sending	troops	to	Vietnam." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	course	I	did.	And	of	course	you	are.	Diem	goes	from	washing	dishes in	U.S.	to	presidency	of	South	Vietnam.	This	is	truly	land	of	opportunity." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	was	elected,	you	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	have	elections	ourselves,	you	know.	And	Diem	has	made	sure	he	will not	have	to	face	another.	Which	must	embarrass	you	as	much	as	his repression	of	Buddhists.	But	he	is	hardly	first	enemy	of	democracy	and religious	freedom	that	U.S.	has	supported.	I	am	sure	you	can	rid yourselves	of	him	if	he	becomes	an	embarrassment." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	nodded.	"Vietnam." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Perhaps." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p439"></a>"Nothing	closer?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh.	What's	certain?	Maybe	closer,	maybe	further.	Maybe	sooner,	maybe later.	The	world	is	now	so	small	that	further	may	not	matter.	But	later matters.	Later	is	better.	Sometimes	later	becomes	never."	Dmitri	patted my	back.	"My	Ludmilla	is	this	tall.	Must	our	children	pay	for	our obstinancy?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Krushchev	said,	'We	will	bury	you.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dmitri	nodded.	"He	did	not	say	we	will	drop	missiles	on	your	heads	to save	ourselves	trouble	of	burying	you.	I	tell	you	this,	Artie,	my	old friend.	Communism	and	capitalism,	these	are	ideas.	Neither	of	our nations	gives	flesh	to	vision	of	Karl	Marx	or	Adam	Smith.	Our	states could	both	become	dust	before	breath	of	history,	yet	this	would	not	mean either	of	our	ideals	had	failed.	Notions	outlive	nations." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	talked	for	sometime	after	that,	about	a	pub	and	two	sisters.	I finished	my	Ranger	Rick	and	went	outside.	Dmitri	took	a	picture	of	me under	the	Heart	Tree,	and	when	he	drove	away	in	a	big	blue	American	car, I	watched	Mr.	Drake	watch	him	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p440"></a>For	Christmas,	you're	supposed	to	buy	people	stuff	that	you	would	like, so	I	bought	Little	Bit	a	red	and	yellow	plastic	biplane	with	a	propeller that	spun	and	a	pilot	in	goggles	and	flight	helmet	who	could	be	removed from	his	cockpit	and	balanced	on	a	ledge	or	on	another	toy	like	a	horse or	a	truck	until	it	was	time	for	him	to	take	to	the	air	to	do	battle with	the	Hun.	I	must	have	gotten	something	for	everyone	else,	something along	the	lines	of	porcelain	dogs	from	Dogland's	gift	shop	for	the Grandmas	and	a	tie	for	Grandpa	Abner	and	something	red	like	a	scarf	or	a glass	brooch	for	Ma	and	something	for	a	smoker	like	cigars	or	tobacco	or a	corncob	pipe	for	Pa	and	a	farm	playset	or	a	fire	engine	for	Digger, but	the	biplane	was	the	best	toy	of	the	season.	I	wanted	to	get	it	for myself,	but	Ma	showed	me	that	I	did	not	have	enough	money	saved	from	my tips	and	allowance	to	buy	it	and	presents	for	everyone	in	the	family.	Ma thought	I	should	get	Little	Bit	a	doll	or	a	toy	tea	set,	but	I	pointed out	that	Little	Bit	hated	girl's	toys	and	assured	Ma	that	Little	Bit would	love	the	biplane. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	a	plan	for	the	red	and	yellow	biplane:	Little	Bit	liked	playing with	boy's	toys,	but	she	tired	quickly	of	them.	I	knew	the	biplane	would soon	be	neglected	by	her,	and	then	it	would	be	mine	to	play	with	as	I pleased. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p441"></a>Grandpa	sent	us	a	Christmas	tree	from	Minnesota.	Pa	said	there	were plenty	of	trees	in	Florida	if	you	wanted	to	kill	one	for	the	holiday, but	Ma	said	Florida	pines	were	too	scrawny	and	ugly	for	a	proper Christmas	tree,	and	it	was	true	that	Grandpa's	tree	was	a	perfect	green cone	like	you	found	in	every	illustrated	Christmas	tale.	Ma	let	us	pick our	favorite	ornaments	from	the	cardboard	box	that	normally	stayed	in the	top	of	the	closet,	and	we	placed	them	where	we	thought	best.	Ma draped	the	colored	lights	and	cellophane	strands	of	fringe,	but	we	kids tossed	the	clumps	of	silver	tinsel	on	the	branches.	The	tree	stood	in the	corner	of	Ma	and	Pa's	room,	and	I	got	to	crawl	under	the	branches every	day	or	two	to	pour	water	into	the	red	metal	stand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grandma	Letitia	sent	us	Scandinavian	holiday	food	baked	by	older Lutheran	Rosecroix	women	who	remembered	Swedish	and	Norwegian	traditions more	fondly	than	any	Swede	or	Norwegian.	I	hated	the	candied	bits	in fruit	cake,	and	I	was	indifferent	to	the	crisp	flat	discs	that	were sugar	cookies,	but	I	had	a	fondness	for	the	moist	small	mounds	that	were butter	cookies,	and	I	knew	the	perfect	Christmas	treat	was	lefse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grandma	Letitia	owned	the	lefse	iron,	a	wide	circular	skillet,	but	she did	not	have	the	knack	of	one	of	Grandpa's	employee's	aunts,	an	old, plump	woman,	old	enough	to	be	Grandma's	mother	or	Mrs.	Santa	Claus,	who came	over	to	Grandma's	kitchen	to	turn	potatoes	into	manna.	Lefse	is</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p442"></a>white	like	clouds,	and	round	like	the	earth,	and	when	God	first	tasted it,	he	said	you	should	spread	it	with	butter,	sprinkle	it	with	sugar, roll	it	into	a	tight	cylinder,	and	eat	it	in	your	hands.	And	God	was	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grandma	Bette	sent	each	of	us	a	Christmas	card	that	said	something	about Jesus.	In	each	card,	she	tucked	a	new	dollar	bill,	four	times	our	weekly allowance,	good	for	twenty	different	candy	bars	that	Little	Bit	would hoard	for	weeks,	and	eight	comic	books	that	I	would	read	in	an	hour	or two,	then	re-read	for	months,	and	one	hundred	pennies	that	Digger	would put	in	his	piggy	bank	and	then	laugh	at	the	sound	it	made	when	he rattled	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	day	before	Christmas,	Ma	told	each	of	us	to	pick	one	of	our	toys to	give	away.	She	bundled	clothes	that	we	had	outgrown	or	outworn,	and she	gathered	old	issues	of	Newsweek	and	Life	and	Ladies	Home	Journal, and	tied	them	all	in	old	sheets	and	towels	and	blankets.	Pa	saw	us carrying	bundles	to	the	station	wagon	and	called,	"Taking	that	trash	to the	dump?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"We're	going	into	town." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Once	a	year,	you	give	people	the	things	you	don't	want.	That's	not	for their	sake.	It's	for	yours." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	Christmas,	Luke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah,"	Pa	said,	as	though	the	point	was	his. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p443"></a>"They	don't	have	anything." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	have	their	pride.	You	take	that	away	when	you	give	'em	hand-me-downs." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	want	me	to	throw	this	away?	I'll	do	that,	if	it'll	make	you	happy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No.	Go	ahead,	Susan.	Feel	better." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As	if	I	could,	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	don't." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	do	you	want,	Luke?	Just	tell	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	want	you	to	do	what	you	want	to	do.	You	want	to	give	people	our trash,	go	right	ahead.	Just	don't	think	it'll	change	anything.	They	need education	and	work,	not	charity." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	at	us	kids,	standing	and	watching	with	our	arms	full.	"Come	on." </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	drove	in	silence	through	the	dusk.	The	Baptist	church	for	Negroes	was smaller	and	plainer	than	the	one	for	white	people,	but	when	Ma	turned off	the	engine,	we	could	hear	people	singing	on	the	other	side	of	the light-filled	windows.	When	the	song	ended,	Ma	said,	"Everyone	needs charity." </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	got	out	of	the	car	with	our	bundles.	The	parking	area,	like	the	road in	the	colored	section	of	Dickison,	was	packed,	rutted	earth,	and	there were	no	street	lights,	only	a	bare	bulb	above	the	church	door.	We	were not	in	darkness,	though.	The	sun	had	not	quite	set,	and	around	us,	a	few porch	lights	burned	in	low-roofed	wooden	houses.	We	were	not	alone, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p444"></a>either.	Black	children	ran	by,	laughing	as	they	played,	and	a	few	adults in	dress	clothes	walked	toward	the	church	door.	One	of	them,	a	man, removed	his	hat	and	said,	"Ma'm?	Can	I	he'p	you	with	them	things?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"No,	thank	you.	I	understood	they	accept	donations	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"For	the	needy,"	said	a	black	woman,	appearing	at	the	doorway.	"Yes, ma'am,	that's	so.	Clevon,	grab	up	them	bundles	'fore	those	chil'en	give out." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,"	said	Ma.	"All	right."	As	we	passed	our	bundles	to	the	adults,	Ma said,	"I	hope	there's	something	here	that'll	help	someone." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	will,"	said	the	black	woman.	"There	ain't	no	act	of	kindness	that don't	help	someone	somewheres.	The	Lord	sees,	and	the	Lord	remembers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	drove	to	Dickison's	black	school	next.	In	my	memory,	it	consisted	of one	large	room	in	a	wooden	structure	that	differed	from	the	houses around	it	only	in	its	size,	but	I	may	remember	the	room	and	have forgotten	the	building.	A	young	black	woman	was	there,	with	several children,	and	they	were	decorating	the	walls	with	red	and	green	crepe paper.	The	young	woman	thanked	Ma	for	the	magazines.	She	seemed especially	pleased	with	the	Ranger	Rick's.	I	looked	at	the	ground,	and felt	a	little	better	about	giving	them	up,	though	I	still	thought	Ma should	not	have	asked	me	to.	The	room	smelled	odd,	a	mixture	of unfamiliar	soaps	and	perfumes,	and	all	the	furniture	was	very	old,	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p445"></a>collection	of	hand-me-downs	from	the	white	school	supplemented	with wooden	chairs	and	tables.	The	kids	watched	Digger	and	Little	Bit	and	me, and	we	watched	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	we	left,	Ma	said,	"There.	Don't	you	feel	better	for	helping	people?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	and	Digger	both	agreed	with	her.	I	said	nothing.	Their gratitude	embarassed	me,	and	so	did	their	poverty,	and	I	felt	lucky	to be	white. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	plan	for	the	red	and	yellow	airplane	failed	miserably.	Little	Bit loved	it	and	rarely	let	me	play	with	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p446"></a>I	had	always	been,	in	Grandma	Bette's	words,	"a	little	pitcher	with	big ears."	Until	I	learned	to	read,	I	made	little	effort	to	understand	the world	beyond	Dogland,	the	world	Pa	studied	through	newspapers	and magazines	and	radio	and	television	and	books,	the	world	he	talked	about with	friends	and	strangers,	the	world	that	I	was	repeatedly	assured school	was	preparing	me	for.	Reading	made	me	a	citizen.	When	I	looked	at pictures	in	magazines,	words	came	from	the	captions	or	within	the pictures	themselves,	shaping	a	world	that	I	knew	but	could	not	describe, a	world	of	people	and	allegiances. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	that	world	in	January	of	1962,	a	conference	in	Geneva	to	end	nucear tests	ended	a	failure.	Ma	and	Pa	both	thought	it	would	be	good	to	ban the	bomb,	but	Pa	doubted	it	would	happen,	saying,	"Humans	never	give	up weapons	before	they've	used	'em."	The	founder	of	the	John	Birch	Society claimed	President	Eisenhower	was	a	dedicated	agent	of	a	Communist conspiracy;	the	John	Birchers	and	the	KKKers	were	never	far	apart	in	any adult's	conversation.	"Lucky"	Luciano	died;	he	was	mobster	like	on	The Untouchables,	except	he	went	to	Naples	instead	of	prison. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	February,	President	Kennedy	stopped	most	U.S.	trade	with	Cuba,	which was	like	laying	siege	to	a	fort.	John	Glenn	blasted	into	space	on	an Atlas	rocket	and	circled	the	Earth	three	times;	Mr.	Shale	said	the	U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p447"></a>was	actually	ahead	of	the	Russians	in	space	because	the	Russians	were faking	their	space	program,	but	ours	was	real	because	God	was	on	our side.	The	U.S.S.R.	swapped	U-2	pilot	Gary	Powers	for	a	Soviet	agent	who had	been	caught	by	the	U.S.,	which	was	bad	because	we	let	a	Commie	spy go,	but	good	because	we	got	back	an	American	pilot	who	had	been	flying high	above	Russia	in	one	of	our	fastest	planes	equipped	with high-powered	photographic	equipment.	The	Pentagon	sent	more	men,	money, and	weaponry	to	Vietnam	because	"this	is	a	war	we	can't	afford	to	lose," </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	President	Kennedy	said	he	had	sent	no	U.S.	combat	troops	"in	the generally	understood	sense	of	the	word"	to	Vietnam.	The	war	in	Vietnam was	not	an	American	war	because	America	had	not	declared	war	on	the North	Vietnamese.	America	was	merely	helping	the	South	Vietnamese, because	all	the	nations	of	the	world	were	like	dominoes,	and	if	South Vietnam	fell,	the	Commies	would	win	the	game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	March,	President	Kennedy	said	the	U.S.	would	resume	atmospheric testing	of	nuclear	bombs	to	stay	ahead	of	the	Russians,	Defense Secretary	McNamara	admitted	U.S.	soldiers	in	South	Vietnam	as	military instructors	had	been	in	combat	with	Communist	troops,	and	Fidel	Castro ordered	severe	food	rationing	in	Cuba.	At	a	New	York	rally,	Senator Barry	Goldwater	announced,	"Conservatism	is	young,	virulent	and	alive!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">which	Pa	thought	funny,	though	I	was	too	young	to	appreciate	a	political</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p448"></a>slip	of	the	tongue.	Algeria	won	independence	from	France	after	seven	and a	half	years	of	war;	Pa	said	the	British	were	better	at	giving	up	their empire	than	the	French. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p449"></a>"That	boy's	got	a	touch	of	the	tarbrush,"	Lurleen	said	one	Saturday morning	as	a	slender	man	in	a	dark	suit	got	out	of	a	black	sedan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	laughed.	"One	look?	You	can	tell	with	one	look?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Most	times.	See	how	his	hair's	been	straightened,	and	his	nose	is	a	bit wide?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Maybe	he's	Greek	or	Italian	or	Cuban,	and	he	likes	Brylcream." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Maybe	he's	the	Sheikh	of	Araby.	See	how	he	carries	hisself?	Haughty, like?	He	knows	what	he	is,	and	he's	hopin'	we	don't." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	laughed	again.	"You're	just	looking	because	he's	handsome." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lurleen's	head	snapped	to	the	side	as	she	glared	at	Ma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Isn't	he?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lurleen's	shoulders	dropped.	"I	don't	look	at	no	nig--	At	no	one	that way."	Only	someone	who	knew	her	would	know	she	had	forgiven	Ma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Except	Handyman?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded.	"'Cept	Handyman." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bell	rang	as	the	front	door	opened.	The	man	stepped	inside	and	said with	an	accent	I	did	not	recognize,	"Hello." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lurleen	turned	away	to	adjust	the	row	of	empty	glasses	on	the	back counter.	Ma	said,	"Hi.	Sit	anywhere." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank	you."	There	were	no	customers	in	the	restaurant.	He	took	a	stool</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p450"></a>near	the	door,	not	far	from	where	I	was	working	on	my	most	ambitious drawing,	a	smiling	cowboy	with	pistols	bigger	than	his	head	in	each hand.	He	was	encircled	by	as	many	arrow-shooting	Indians	on	horseback	as I	could	crayon.	They	all	had	the	same	face:	circles	for	eyes,	a checkmark	for	a	nose,	and	an	upward	curve	for	a	mouth.	Even	the	horses smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	said,	"Coffee,	please." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	started	for	the	pot,	but	Lurleen	waved	her	back.	As	she	set	a	cup	and saucer	in	front	of	the	man,	he	turned	his	head	toward	the	window.	"That is	a	very	old	tree,	no?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lurleen	glanced	at	him	before	she	moved	away.	"You	ain't	seen	a	Sequoia." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"That's	an	old	tree	for	Florida.	No	one	knows	how	old.	We	think it's	the	biggest	tree	in	the	county.	It	might	be	the	biggest	in	the	state." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	very	handsome." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	think	so.	Do	they	have	any	like	it	where	you're	from?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	smiled	for	the	first	time.	"No." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are	you	from	France?	We	had	a	French	family	through	just	the	other	day." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	came	through	the	kitchen	doors	with	a	tray	of	coffee	cups	and said,	"That's	no	French	accent." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	not?"	said	Ma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	slender	man	looked	at	Ethorne,	then	at	Ma,	then	smiled	again.	"No, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p451"></a>madam.	But	you're	close.	I'm	from	Haiti." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Really?"	Ma	grinned.	"We've	never	had	visitors	from	Haiti	that	I	know of.	Lots	of	Europeans,	and	some	Japanese,	and	a	nice	man	from	India,	but no	one	from	Haiti.	Oh,	I'd	love	to	go	there." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	a	beautiful	land,"	the	man	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bien	sur,"	said	Ethorne.	"Mais	il	est	pauvre." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Il	ya	des	pauvres,	y	il	ya	des	riches,	comme	tous	les	pais	du	monde." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lurleen	gazed	at	Ethorne	with	one	of	her	rare	smiles.	"French.	If	that don't	beat	all.	You	study	that	in	prison?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	smiled.	"No'm.	I	just	like	to	talk	to	folks	wherever	I	go."	To the	visitor,	he	said,	"Que	voulez	vous	ici?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Rien.	Amusement.	Informacion.	Des	choses	comme	ca." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,"	said	Ethorne,	"I	got	me	a	mess	o'	dishes	to	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nous	parlez	en	bas,	Gran-pere?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	paused	between	the	swinging	doors,	then	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	darn,"	said	Ma.	"Hearing	you	two	go	on	is	as	good	as	a	vacation." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	sorry,"	said	the	man.	"You	must	come	to	Haiti	sometime.	The	people are	very	kind."	He	stood.	"What	do	I	owe?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ten	cents,"	said	Lurleen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"May	I	purchase	a	ticket	for	the	tour	here?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"The	woman	next	door	can	help	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p452"></a>He	nodded	and	walked	toward	the	gift	shop.	I	slid	off	my	stool,	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	goin'	outside,"	ran	past	the	man,	into	the	gift	shop,	said,	"Hi, Mis'	Stark!"	as	I	passed	the	cash	register,	ducked	under	the	turn-stile, and	did	not	slow	down	until	I	had	circled	behind	the	restaurant	trash cans.	I	crouched	there	in	the	shade	and	watched	fat	ants	the	color	of lobsters	march	to	their	sandy	home	at	the	border	of	the	sidewalk	and	the gravel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	back	door	opened,	then	footsteps	approached,	then	Ethorne	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey,	cowboy.	You	a	secret	agent	man	now?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	"That	man's	a	com'nist." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	laughed.	"No,	I	don't	think	so."	He	looked	up	as	someone	stepped around	the	corner,	and,	stepping	forward,	out	of	my	sight,	he	asked, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why	you	call	me	Gran-pere?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"From	respect.	You	are	Et'orne	'Awkins." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	call	me	Ethorne	Hawkins.	An'	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ethorne	Hawkins,	yes.	I	am	Antoine	D'Hiver.	I	was	told	you	know	a	great deal	about	these	parts." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	hang	around	long	enough,	you	hear	all	kinds	of	lies." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eugenie	said	this." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne's	voice	softened.	"She	still	livin'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p453"></a>"How	she	die?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In	peace.	In	her	little	house.	We	invited	her	to	join	us	in	the	city, but	she	refused.	She	might	still	be	alive	today,	if	she	had	not	insisted that	she	wished	to	stay	in	the	hills." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	'xpect	she	knew	what	was	best	for	her	spirit." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	was	my	gran-mere." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	proud	of	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	course!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mmm-hmm.	You	get	to	my	age,	you	hear	all	kinds	of	lies." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	lit	a	cigarette.	Then	Antoine	D'Hiver	spoke.	"She	said	she	loved me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don'	doubt	that.	Your	daddy	marry	a	rich	woman?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My	mother	married	a	rich	man.	Does	that	matter?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your	daddy	work	for	Papa	Doc?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	yes.	Why--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	work	for	Papa	Doc?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Does	that	mat--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Papa	Doc	sends	his	Tonton	Macoutes	to	terrorize	folks	and	forces	folks to	worship	the	way	he	sees	fit	and	keeps	folks	poor	while	he	lives	high. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Know	a	man	by	his	master." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your	government	supports	ours." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p454"></a>"Did	Eugenie?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	moment,	Antoine	D'Hiver	said,	"I	should	not	have	come." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	sniffin'	'round	to	help	out	Papa	Doc,	you	right,	nobody	needs	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	lookin'	to	learn	a	little	more	about	life,	there's	worse	places'n Latchahie	County." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Does	patriotism	keep	you	here?	There	are	countries	where	you	do	not have	to	be	a	nigger." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Seems	like	someone's	got	to	be	a	nigger	wherever	you	go.	Light-skinned folks	got	it	over	dark	skins	in	Haiti." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You'd	prefer	the	black-skinned	rule?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	laughed.	"Turnin'	evil	upside	down	don'	make	it	good." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	know,	boy,	if'n	you	read	up	on	quests,	hardly	any	of	'em	work	out like	the	quester	figures.	Findin'	somethin'	don'	mean	you	can	take	it home.	Don'	even	mean	you	can	take	yourself	home.	An'	if	you	do	get	back, you	find	home	changes	while	you	gone.	So	do	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Would	you	say	America	is	a	good	land?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'd	say	most	lands	got	some	good	in	'em." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	know	what	I	ask." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	chuckled.	"America's	got	the	finest	ideals	of	any	place	I	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someday,	it	might	live	up	to	'em." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p455"></a>"A	matter	of	time?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Some	have	more	time	than	others." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There's	a	connection	'tween	how	much	time	you	has	an'	how	big	a	hurry you	in."	A	cigarette	butt	sailed	out	onto	the	gravel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	confess,	I	hoped	for	more." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	hoped	for	a	shortcut.	That's	natural.	But	now	you	ain't	found	one, you	might	as	well	head	home	an'	get	to	work." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	see." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	'member	Eugenie.	Think	on	what	she	would'a'	done." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Antoine	D'Hiver	took	several	steps,	each	a	crunch	of	loose	stone	beneath new	leather	soles.	Then	Ethorne	said,	"You	done	paid	your	entrance	fee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Might	as	well	see	the	dogs	'fore	you	go.	Got	over	a	hun'ed	breeds,	you know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Waste	not,	want	not?"	Antoine	D'Hiver	laughed.	"You're	right.	Thank you,	Gran-pere." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	welcome,	son."	I	heard	him	walk	away.	Then	Ethorne	said,	"Time	for me	to	get	back	to	work.	I	'xpect	a	secret	agent'd	sneak	away	from	here	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	kitchen	door	closed,	I	ran	down	the	path	toward	our	house, passing	the	sign	warning	"Private."	The	fence	on	two	sides	of	our	home</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p456"></a>was	seven	feet	tall	and	built	of	pine	boards,	interlaced	like	popsicle sticks	when	you	made	them	into	a	raft	for	toy	soldiers	or	a	fan	to	cool yourself.	You	could	roll	under	the	fence,	which	was	designed	to	block visitors'	sight	and	not	the	breeze,	but	since	there	might	be	burrs	or anything	in	the	grass,	I	ran	through	the	opening,	having	to	zigzag because	a	short	wall	beyond	the	passway	kept	tourists	from	seeing within.	Little	Bit	and	Digger	played	near	the	side	of	the	Doggy	Salon	on the	metal	swingset	that	had	come	as	a	kit	from	Sears.	Beside	the	house, Mrs.	Green,	one	of	the	black	women	who	worked	for	Ma,	was	feeding clothes	through	the	wringer	of	our	ancient	electric	washing	machine.	I ran	without	pausing	through	the	second	passway	to	pause	at	the	back	of the	Doggy	Salon	and	the	beginning	of	the	path	around	the	dog	pens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey,	Speedy,"	Francy	said.	"What	you	up	to?"	She,	James,	and	Seth	sat on	a	low	bench	beneath	the	building's	overhang. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothin'."	One	of	the	rules	was	that	I	could	not	offer	to	guide	visitors if	any	of	the	workers	were	available. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Antoine	D'Hiver	stepped	out	of	the	Doggy	Salon.	The	three	workers glanced	at	each	other.	They	had	established	their	own	rules;	unless	she was	busy,	Francy	guided	white	visitors.	Seth,	picking	up	his	cane,	told Francy,	"He	could	be	lynched	for	whistling	at	you,"	stood,	and	called, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Like	a	tour,	brother?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p457"></a>"I'm	not--"	Antoine	D'Hiver	nodded.	"Yes.	Please." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	smiled	to	the	others	and	walked	away.	I	was	about	to	follow	when Francy	asked	me,	"You	miss	me	if	I	go	away?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	as	James	told	her,	"You	should	finish	school." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	can	finish	somewheres	else."	She	looked	sideways	at	James.	"Cal's goin'	hear	where	I	been.	You	know	he	will." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	'xpect." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Got	a	better	idea?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	looked	at	the	ground	and	shook	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where	you	goin'?"	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	thinkin'	up	north.	Seth	says	San	Francisco's	s'posed	to	be	nice." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Rice-a-roni,"	I	sang.	"The	San	Francisco	treat." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francy	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	asked	her,	"What	you	got	up	North?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Maybe	a	chance." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	both	looked	up	the	path	where	Seth	had	gone.	James	said,	"All right."	He	stood.	"I	best	put	the	German	Pointer	in	the	exercise	pen." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can	I	help?"	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	could	help	me	hose	the	pens,"	Francy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Race	to	the	middle?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francy	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p458"></a>"I'll	go	this	way!"	I	darted	up	the	left-hand	path.	That	side	of	the tour	had	more	empty	cages	than	the	right,	where	most	tourists	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only	one	or	two	runs	per	kennel	needed	hosing.	I	had	gotten	perhaps	a quarter	of	the	way	around	when	Seth	and	Antoine	D'Hiver	approached.	Seth gave	the	usual	speech	about	each	dog.	Antoine	interrupted	once.	Seth	had said,	"The	Basenji's	an	ancient	breed,	and	very	close	in	appearance	to	a true	wild	dog." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	do	you	mean?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Every	dog	here's	the	product	of	selective	breeding,	some	by	man,	some by	nature.	If	you	let	'em	run	wild	and	breed	as	they	please,	within	two or	three	generations	most	of	the	pups	would	look	like	Bambi	there.	Their fur	might	vary	some	in	length	and	color,	but	the	basic	size	and	shape	of the	dog	would	be	pretty	much	like	that.	Wild	dogs	in	India,	Africa,	and Australia	all	are	mighty	similar." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mmm,"	said	Antoine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	beat	Francy	to	the	middle	of	the	circle,	but	she	pointed	out	that	I'd missed	a	little	high	up	in	the	Great	Dane's	cage,	so	we	called	it	a	tie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	she,	Seth,	and	James	fed	the	dogs,	I	ran	up	to	the	gift	shop.	As	I walked	in,	I	said,	"Hey,	Mis'	Stark,	guess	what	I	know?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why,	I	surely	cannot	imagine.	What	would	that	be,	Christopher?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Francy's	goin'	up	north." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p459"></a>"No!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yep!"	I	didn't	see	Ma,	so	I	crossed	into	the	restaurant.	Ma	was standing	beside	Pa,	reading	a	typewritten	sheet	of	paper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa,	grinning	at	her,	said,	"Well?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	handed	it	back	to	him.	"You're	going	to	send	it	in?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	didn't	write	it	for	fun." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	don't	like	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	didn't	say	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	only	responding	to	some	damn	fool." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	know,"	said	Ma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Never	argue	with	a	fool,"	Lurleen	said.	"Folks	can't	tell	you	apart." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	smiled.	"Isn't	the	editorial	page	where	every	idiot	with	an	opinion can	express	it?	I	might	as	well	step	up	for	a	turn."	He	glanced	at	Ma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	the	spelling's	all	right,	send	that	in."	Ma	looked	at	the	floor tiles.	Pa	laughed	again	and	kissed	her	forehead.	"Cheer	up,	Susan.	They prob'ly	won't	run	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since	they	seemed	to	have	finished,	I	said,	"Hey,	Ma!	Guess	what?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lurleen,	Pa,	and	Ma	all	looked	at	me.	I	grinned.	"Francy's	goin'	up	north!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	is?"	Ma	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Damn,"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p460"></a>Lurleen	said,	"Might	be	best,"	and	we	all	looked	at	her.	She	cocked	her head	to	one	side	and	said,	"She	can't	stay	here	after	what	she's	done." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's	she	done?"	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	fire	people	for	what	they	do	on	their	own	time,"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What'd	she	do,	Pa?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	ain't	what	I	meant,"	said	Lurleen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	at	her.	"That	mean	you	couldn't	keep	working	here?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Me?"	Lurleen	snorted.	"You	could	fill	this	place	with	colored homosexual	communist	atheists,	and	I	could	work	along	side	'em,	long	as they	let	me	be." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What'd	Francy	do?"	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	at	Pa,	who	said,	"She	spent	last	night	at	the	Hawkins	home." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Captain	John's?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No.	Ethorne,	Seth,	and	James'	place." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,"	I	said,	disappointed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	laughed	and	set	his	hand	on	my	crewcut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne,	wiping	his	damp	hands	on	his	apron,	stepped	out	from	the kitchen.	"In	case	you	wonderin',	and	I	know	you	is,	I	told	'em	it	was	a fool	thing	to	do.	But	Francy	said	she	was	near	a	divorcee	now,	and	then she	started	quotin'	Elvis	Presley	songs	at	me.	I	had	to	give	in." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lurleen	whispered	harshly,	"Ethorne	Hawkins,	you	know	better'n	that!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p461"></a>Ethorne	shrugged.	"Cal	Carter	was	comin'	over	to	her	sister's	place	near ever'	night	an'	botherin'	'em.	Her	brother-in-law	turned	her	out,	an' </p>
<p class="calibre1">her	Ma	said	Francy'd	made	her	bed	when	she	run	off	with	Cal,	so	now	it was	time	to	lie	in	it.	That	girl	walked	near	ten	miles	carryin'	her	baby to	our	place.	Was	I	to	turn	'em	out	too?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lurleen	glared	at	him.	"You	know	the	answer	to	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Her	an'	the	boy	said	they	wanted	to	be	together.	She	said	she	deserved a	good	man,	an'	she'd	found	one.	Said	she	di'n't	care	who	knew." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	long	you	been	around,	Ethorne?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	smiled	sadly.	"It's	all	right.	They	both	leavin'	after	they	pick	up their	pay." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	decided?"	Ma	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	decided	last	night,	whether	they	knew	it	or	not.	Only	question	now is	where	they	go.	Maybe	Harlem.	I	got	friends	there	can	look	after	'em." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Or	maybe	San	Francisco?"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	smiled	at	me.	"I	got	friends	there,	too."	Then	he	met	the	gaze of	the	other	adults	in	the	room.	"Once	they	gone,	it'll	just	be somethin'	for	folks	to	gnaw	over	for	a	week	or	two,	is	all,"	Ethorne finished.	Lurleen	began	to	say	something,	but	some	tourists	came	in,	and the	conversation	was	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	ran	back	by	our	house	to	find	Little	Bit	and	Digger.	They	were</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p462"></a>building	roads	in	the	dirt	beneath	the	swingset.	I	said,	"I	know something	you	don't." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"Francy	an'	James	are	goin'	north	to	be	married." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	Seth?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Seth's	immature." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Seth's	smart." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"James	is	smarter." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Seth	reads	good." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	Francy	should	marry	Seth." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Seth,"	Little	Bit	repeated	patiently	as	she	scooped	a	tunnel	for Digger's	race	car,	"is	immature." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Says	who?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Francy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's	'immature'	mean?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	shrugged.	"Means	Francy's	marryin'	James." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	don't	remember	lunch.	I	probably	ate	a	rebel	burger	in	the	kitchen with	Ethorne.	Digger,	Little	Bit,	and	I	spent	the	afternoon	playing	in the	yard	within	reach	of	the	eye	and	ear	of	Mrs.	Green,	who	cleaned	the house	while	clothes	dried	on	the	line.	We	usually	turned	on	the	TV	for the	Saturday	afternoon	movie.	If	it	starred	Tarzan	or	Bomba	the	Jungle</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p463"></a>Boy	or	Jungle	Jim,	we	watched	it	without	moving,	but	if	it	was	about Dracula	or	Frankenstein,	I	said	I	was	bored	and	pointed	out	that	Digger was	getting	scared.	Little	Bit	liked	scary	movies,	so	I	took	plastic cowboys	and	Indians	from	my	toy	box	and	played	with	Digger	while	peeking at	the	gray	shadows	on	the	screen	and	listening	to	every	static-filled sound.	The	only	things	worse	than	scary	movies	were	sad	ones,	because they	made	you	cry	in	public.	If	the	movie	was	about	horses	or	dogs,	I watched	reluctantly,	knowing	at	least	I	would	not	lie	awake	that	night wondering	what	waited	behind	each	closed	door	of	the	bedroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	end	of	the	day,	Pa	called,	"Chris!	Little	Bit!	Digger!	Dinner!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	all	ran.	I	beat	Little	Bit,	though	no	one	noticed.	Ethorne	had	made two	batches	of	fried	chicken,	one	spicy	for	Pa	and	one	bland	for	Ma	and us	kids.	In	one	pot,	he	had	fixed	rice	with	saffron,	black	pepper,	pork sausage,	onions,	green	beans,	and	tomatoes.	In	another,	he	had	fixed something	he	only	identified	as	"greens"	that	looked	suspiciously	like spinach.	Ma	said,	"Oh,	Ethorne,	that's	lovely,	but	there's	too	much." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	nodded.	"Yes'm.	There'll	be	travel	food	for	the	young	folks." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh.	Of	course." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	ate	everything	except	the	tomatoes,	which	I	left	on	my	plate,	and	no one	said	anything.	I	alternated	bites	with	corn	fritters	and	cold	milk, and	for	desert,	we	ate	bourbon	pecan	tarts	which,	Ethorne	explained,	had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p464"></a>not	been	named	for	the	kings	of	France. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	we	were	eating,	the	side	door	opened.	James	said,	"Mist'	Nix?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just	finishing	up	here,	James.	If	you	want	to	set	out	a	little	early,	I can	get	your	pay	together	in	a	minute." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	sir,	that	ain't	it.	Seth	an'	Francy're	finishin'	up	out	back.	If'n you	don't	mind,	I'd	like	to	run	home	an'	fetch	the	truck,	so's	we	can light	out	straightaway." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sure.	Tell	Francy	to	knock	off,	and	you	could	both	go	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	smiled	and	shook	his	head.	"Might	as	well	spare	her	the	walk.	It's a	long	night	ahead	of	us." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	get	moving	then,"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	door	closed	behind	him,	Ma	said,	"Luke,	you	should've	told	them to	leave	earlier." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	closed	his	eyes,	inhaled,	then	opened	them.	"I	did	tell	them	to	leave earlier.	They	said	they	wanted	to	finish	up	here	proper." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mmm,"	said	Ma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Pride's	important." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	not	the	most	important	thing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh?	And	what	is?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Things	like	this.	Being	together	as	a	family." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	laughed.	"What's	that	got	to	do	with	anything?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p465"></a>"Which	would	you	trade?	Family	or	pride?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	laughed	again.	"Why	trade?"	He	looked	at	the	clock,	then	at	the parking	lot	which	was	empty	of	visitors'	cars.	"Time	to	check	out.	Want to	count	the	ones,	Chris?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged.	Ma	glanced	at	me	and	flicked	her	eyes	once	toward	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Yes,	sir,"	and	followed	Pa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	crossed	between	the	restaurant	and	the	gift	shop,	he	said,	"I	hear that	after	you	give	folks	a	tour,	you've	got	a	trick	of	rattling	coins in	your	pocket	till	they	give	you	a	tip." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sir?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	the	same	as	begging.	If	people	choose	to	give	you	money,	that's their	business.	If	not,	that's	life.	Nixes	don't	beg." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	sir."	I	felt	like	I	had	after	walking	into	the	woman's	house	next to	Grandpa	and	Grandma's	cabin.	I	had	not	known	I	was	doing	anything wrong	until	the	wrong	thing	was	already	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Stark,	on	the	telephone,	said,	"Oh,	it's	quitting	time,	I	best	be going.	Bye!"	She	shook	her	head	at	us	both.	"Ain't	that	something	'bout Francy?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	sure	is,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mmm,"	Pa	said.	"How'd	we	do?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	it	was	a	good	day.	One	woman	came	in,	she	was	all	crazy	about</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p466"></a>Scotties,	you	know,	an'	she	spent	near	forty	dollars	on	dish	towels	and them	painted	china	plaques	and	little	figurines	of	ever'	size.	I	steered her	to	everything	we	had	with	a	Scottie	dog	on	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	right,"	Pa	said	with	satisfaction,	and	he	said	it	again	after looking	at	the	register	tape.	He	took	the	cash	out	of	the	drawer, counted	out	one	ten,	three	fives,	and	twenty-five	ones,	and	returned that	to	the	drawer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Why	do	you	put	some	back?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	we	can	make	change	tomorrow	morning." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	pointed	at	the	register	drawer,	which	he	had	left	ajar.	"You	don't close	that	so	if	thieves	break	in,	they	won't	break	the	register	trying to	get	it	open.	That	way,	you	may	be	out	fifty	dollars,	but	you're	not also	out	a	cash	register	that	costs	a	damn	sight	more." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	handed	me	a	wad	of	ones.	While	he	made	stacks	of	fives	and	tens	and twenties,	I	went	through	the	ones,	making	sure	no	larger	bills	had accidentally	gotten	in	with	them	and	orienting	them	so	that	George Washington	was	on	top,	not	the	eye	in	the	pyramid.	Then	I	counted	them, told	Pa	the	number,	and	watched	him	count	them.	If	he	started	to	count them	a	second	time,	I	knew	I	had	made	a	mistake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	finished,	Ma	came	up	from	the	house	with	a	green	deposit	bag	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p467"></a>took	from	it	envelopes	with	each	employee's	pay.	Little	Bit	and	Digger were	with	her,	so	we	ran	up	and	down	the	aisles	of	the	gift	shop	until Ma	told	us	not	to	get	too	excited.	Seth	and	Francy	came	in,	and	Francy said,	"James	ain't	back	yet?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"He	hasn't	been	gone	all	that	long." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	gave	her	and	Seth	their	envelopes,	then	said,	"Well,	I	guess	you might	as	well	take	James'." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francy	smiled	and	mumbled,	"Yes'm."	A	moment	later,	she	said,	"Mis'	Nix, there's	too	much--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Pa	looked	up,	Ma	said,	"That's	a	little	something	extra	to	help	you get	settled." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francy	said,	"You	both	been	too	kind." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	and	Lurleen	came	in.	Lurleen	accepted	her	envelope	with	a	nod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Thanks,	ma'am."	Then	he	glanced	at	Seth.	"Where's	your brother?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gone	to	get	the	truck." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne's	face	tightened,	hard	as	tree	bark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"He	hasn't	been	gone	that	long." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Mist'	Luke,	would	you	mind--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	Pa	said.	"Come	on." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Me,	too!"	Little	Bit	called. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p468"></a>Lurleen	said,	"What's	goin'	on?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothing,"	Pa	said.	"Susan'll	take	you	and	Mrs.	Stark	home	in	the	Dodge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francy,	you	and	Seth	stay	here	in	case	we	miss	James.	You	kids--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ride	in	the	back	of	the	truck!"	Little	Bit	called. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	isn't	room	for	all	of	them	in	the	Dodge,"	Ma	said.	"Little	Bit--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ride	in	the	back	of	the	truck!"	she	repeated.	"Yayy!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	going,"	Pa	said,	which	meant	get	in	or	be	left	behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	and	I	ran	ahead	of	everyone	and	scrambled	over	the	tailgate into	the	back	of	our	pick-up.	It	smelled	of	earth	and	blood	and	oil	and rust,	and	you	sat	on	rags	that	did	not	let	you	forget	that	the	bed	of the	truck	was	corrugated	steel,	and	every	rut	in	the	road	was	announced to	you	through	your	spinal	cord,	and	it	was	better	than	any	carnival ride.	Ethorne	put	Digger	on	the	bench	seat	in	front,	between	him	and	Pa, and	we	drove	away.	Ma	waved	without	smiling,	then	walked	toward	her	car with	Lurleen	and	Mrs.	Stark,	while	Francy	and	Seth	squatted	on	the sidewalk,	talking	solemnly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	edge	of	the	sky	began	to	smolder.	Sunset	should	be	the	most frightening	time	of	the	day,	but	familiarity	makes	it	safe,	or	perhaps we	secretly	yearn	for	endings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	and	I	grinned	at	each	other,	united	in	the	rattle	and	the wind	as	Pa	drove	on	the	highway	and	then	the	dirt	road	to	Ethorne's</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p469"></a>house.	We	had	seen	it	often,	so	we	did	not	try	to	look	forward	through the	dirty	glass	windows	of	the	pick-up's	cab.	Watching	the	world	recede in	our	dust,	we	knew	that	at	the	end	of	our	trip	was	a	wooden	house	in which	every	door	and	every	window	was	unique.	Its	roof	was	a	crazy	quilt of	shingles	and	tin	and	tar	paper.	It	stood	in	a	clump	of	trees,	and grass	grew	high	around	it,	so	you	could	not	be	sure	of	its	shape	or	its size.	On	one	side	was	a	vegetable	garden	and	a	rose	bush,	and	on	the other,	slowly	being	reclaimed	by	the	earth,	a	rusty	car	that	Ethorne said	was	so	old	that	it	had	run	on	steam	instead	of	gasoline. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	could	also	not	be	sure	what	you'd	find	in	Ethorne's	yard	or	on	his porch.	People	and	animals	came	and	went.	We	expected	to	see	chickens,	a goat,	a	dog	named	Wolf,	and	a	sparrow	that	would	sit	on	Ethorne's shoulder.	If	there	were	people,	we	expected	fat	women	or	skinny children,	their	skin	dark	and	clean,	their	clothing	worn	and	simple. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	pick-up	slowed	as	we	approached	Ethorne's	house.	I	turned	to	look, then	grabbed	the	side	of	the	truck	as	it	bolted	forward.	I	had	seen	too many	automobiles	in	Ethorne's	yard,	and	five	or	six	white	men	in	a	ring performing	a	dance	that,	for	several	of	them,	consisted	of	stepping forward	and	kicking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	shouted	when	our	truck	hurtled	into	the	yard.	As	the	brakes squealed,	Little	Bit	and	I	slammed	against	the	cab,	hard	enough	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p470"></a>frighten	rather	than	hurt	us.	Both	doors	opened,	and	Pa	and	Ethorne stepped	out	on	each	side.	Pa	said,	"Lie	down	and	stay	down,"	to	us	so quietly	and	so	calmly	that	Little	Bit	and	I	obeyed	without	speaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	dancing	men	said,	"God	damn	it,	man--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	said,	"You	could'a'	killed	someone,	drivin'	like	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	third	said,	"Luke,	this	ain't	none	of	your	affair."	By	the	end	of	his sentence,	I	had	recognized	Handyman's	voice.	"Just	take	them	children and	drive	off." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	his	brother	we	want,"	said	Cal	Carter,	in	perhaps	the	most reasonable	tones	so	far.	"If'n	he	hadn't	tried	to	run	off,	we wouldn't'a'	hurt	him	none	at	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	saw	Ethorne's	head	pass	the	bed	of	the	truck	as	he	said,	"Don't	force yourself	up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	spoke	with	a	thick,	low	voice.	"I	can	stand." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	white	man	said,	"Let	'im	be.	You	said	he's	not	the	one."	I looked	at	Little	Bit,	and	she	nodded;	that	was	Dr.	Lamont's	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal	said,	"That's	the	nigger	we	got." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"You	haven't	got	anyone." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ain't	your	affair,"	Cal	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"These're	my	nighbors,	my	workers,	and	my	friends.	I	don't	see how	it's	not	my	affair." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p471"></a>Handyman	said,	"I	didn't	want	no	violence,	Luke.	I	come	to	keep	things from	gettin'	too	het	up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mmm,"	Pa	said.	"And	you,	Doc?	You	here	to	fix	things	up	if	they	got	out of	hand?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	about	the	size	of	it,"	Dr.	Lamont	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"I'm	just	goin'	to	take	my	boy	over	to	the	porch	there." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hold	on,"	Cal	said.	"Don't	no	one	move." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	a	witness,"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Easy,	Luke,"	Handyman	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's	all	stay	calm,"	Dr.	Lamont	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal	screamed,	"I	want	that	lame	little	nigger	that's	fuckin'	my	wife!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handyman	said,	"Cal,	put	that	down.	I	thought	we	had	an	agreement." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethone	said	calmly,	"Seth	ain't	here.	I'll	just--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	said	don't!"	Cal	yelled,	and	then	something	exploded,	louder	than	a cherry	bomb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	fell.	The	air	stank	of	bitter	smoke.	I	stared	at	the	rusty ridged	bed	of	the	truck.	Little	Bit	began	to	move	beside	me.	I	caught her	hand,	then	touched	my	finger	to	my	lips,	and	she	stayed	still. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handyman	said,	"Hell,"	and	James	said,	"Ethorne?"	and	Cal	screamed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	you	move!	Don't	neither	of	you	move!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	I	heard	someone	sliding	from	the	seat	of	the	truck.	Little	Bit</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p472"></a>peeked	first,	and	I	peeked	second.	Pa	stood	near	the	rear	of	the	truck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	group	of	white	men	stood	in	a	half-circle	around	James,	who	stood, his	face	bloody,	leaning	toward	a	rifle	in	Cal's	hands	that	swiveled back	and	forth	between	James	and	Pa.	A	few	steps	from	the	other	side	of the	truck,	almost	hidden	by	tall	weeds,	lay	Ethorne,	and	running	toward him	was	Digger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shouted,	"Digger!	No!"	and	took	a	step	forward.	Cal	swung	his	rifle towards	Digger.	As	he	did,	James	lurched	forward,	grabbing	the	rifle	and wrenching	it	from	Cal's	hands.	Cal	lunged	toward	James,	but	Handyman	and a	man	I	had	never	seen	before	both	grabbed	Cal's	shoulders.	Handyman said,	"Easy,	goddamn	it!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	never	turned	from	Ethorne.	He	touched	Ethorne's	ankle,	a	ring	of bare	skin	between	pale	jeans	and	black	work	boots,	and	said,	"Et'orne? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Get	up,	Et'orne." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	held	out	his	hand	and	said	softly,	"Digger?	Come	here."	Dr.	Lamont stepped	toward	Digger	and	Ethorne.	Pa	slapped	his	hand	against	Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lamont's	chest.	"You're	not	fit	to	touch	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	shook	Ethorne's	ankle.	"Et'orne?	Wake	up,	Et'orne,	it's	day." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Lamont	said,	"I'd	help	a	dog	live,	if	I	could." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	left	his	hand	against	Dr.	Lamont's	chest,	and	Dr.	Lamont	did	not move.	Pa	called,	still	gently	but	more	loudly,	"Digger,	come	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p473"></a>James	kept	the	rifle	aimed	at	Cal's	stomach.	"How's	Ethorne?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	didn't	mean--"	Cal	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shut	up,"	Handyman	said	reasonably. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Digger!"	Pa	repeated,	loudly	enough	that	Digger	turned	and	looked	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Et'orne's	sleepin',"	Digger	said.	"But	it's	not	bedtime." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	at	James.	"You	trust	the	doc?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	squeezed	Ethorne's	ankle.	"Et'orne?	It's	time	to	get	up	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	told	Pa,	"Someone's	got	to	see	to	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handyman	looked	at	the	other	white	men,	then	said,	"Far	as	I'm concerned,	this	is	over."	Several	of	the	others	mumbled	sounds	of	agreement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	dropped	his	hand	from	Dr.	Lamont's	shirt.	"See	what	you	can	do."	He turned	toward	Digger,	offering	his	open	palm,	and,	beside	him,	Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lamont	stepped	forward.	Then	both	men	held	still. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne's	work	boot	twitched	as	Digger	released	his	ankle.	One	of	the white	men	inhaled	harshly.	Ethorne	sat	up.	"Do	'bout	what?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	laughed	as	Digger	walked	over	to	take	his	hand.	"Christ,	Ethorne,	I figured	you	for	a	gonner	for	sure!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled,	and	Little	Bit	clapped	her	hands,	saying,	"Yayy,	Ethorne!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	looked	at	her,	then	clapped	too,	his	hands	almost	missing	each other.	"Yayy,	Et'orne!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	frowned,	then	got	to	his	feet	and	grinned.	Doctor	Lamont	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p474"></a>"You're	all	right?"	Ethorne	nodded,	and	so	did	Dr.	Lamont,	adding, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well.	No	harm	done,	then." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	atmosphere	of	relief	failed	at	two	points.	James	cried	quietly, tears	trickling	over	the	high	bones	of	his	cheeks.	The	rifle	did	not waver.	His	target	cringed,	staring	at	Ethorne,	whispering,	almost whimpering,	"I	killed	'im.	I	killed	that	nigger." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handyman	clapped	Cal	on	the	back.	"Ain't	ever'day	you	got	'cause	to	be happy	you're	such	a	piss-poor	shot."	Cal	stared	at	Handyman,	who	added, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	all	got	out	o'	hand.	Now	we	just	back	off	and	let	things	be,	all right?	I	told	you	before,	you	lucky	to	be	rid	of	a	woman	who'd	run	off with	a	nigger." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	at	Ethorne.	"What	now?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"James,	you	think	that	rifle'd	make	up	for	what	happened here?	Enough	to	forgive	and	forget?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	shook	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Bruises	heal." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	said	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Then	what	else	is	there?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	looked	at	Cal.	"I'm	goin'	away.	With	Francy,	who	ain't	your	wife no	more.	You	never	wanted	Seth,	and	you	still	don't." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hell,	take	the	bitch	for	all	I	care,"	Cal	said	cooly,	but	his	gaze</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p475"></a>flicked	incessantly	between	James	and	Ethorne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Lamont	said,	"So,	Ethorne,	did	you	faint,	or	were	you	just	playin' </p>
<p class="calibre1">possum?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"You're	gonna	just	forget	what	happened	here?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Di'n't	say	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	pointed	at	the	group	of	white	men.	"They	should	be	charged.	We	should take	'em	back	to	Dogland	and	call	the	sheriff." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"No	need	to	embarrass	Rooster	like	that.	He'd	arrest	'em if	you	make	a	fuss,	but	they	wou'n't	be	convicted.	If	they	killed	a nigger	and	you	was	a	witness,	they	might	be	convicted,	it's	hard	to	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	in	this	case,	no	one	local	would	say	any	real	harm's	been	done." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	lifted	his	chin	toward	James.	"Yeah?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	swung	the	rifle	butt	to	his	shoulder.	Cal	and	several	of	the	men jumped	back,	but	James	swiveled	toward	the	dirt	road	and	made	a	fence post	thrash	until	the	hammer	clicked	on	an	empty	chamber.	"I	took worse."	He	held	the	rifle	toward	Cal.	"And	I'm	leavin'	with	Francy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	right,"	Cal	said	quietly,	taking	the	rifle	but	still	standing	as though	he	were	under	its	sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your	brother	wouldn't	let	'em	go,"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	James	agreed,	then	looked	at	Ethorne.	"I	hear	livin'	is	the	best</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p476"></a>kind	of	victory." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handyman	squeezed	Cal's	shoulder.	"Let's	get."	Cal	shuddered,	then nodded.	The	white	men	moved	slowly	toward	their	cars.	Handyman	paused with	his	hand	on	his	door	handle,	looked	at	James,	then	shook	his	head and	got	into	the	car.	None	of	the	others	looked	back,	not	even	Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lamont.	We	watched	them	drive,	one	after	another	like	a	funeral procession,	toward	the	highway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	picked	up	Digger	and	carried	him	to	the	truck.	"Let's	go.	If	they	see Seth	at	Dogland--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fight's	out	of	'em,"	Ethorne	said.	"But,	you	right,	we	best	get	back just	in	case."	He	glanced	at	James.	"You	up	to	drivin'?"	James	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	told	Pa,	"I'll	ride	with	my	boy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	Little	Bit	and	I	did	not	suggest	riding	in	the	back	of	the truck;	we	got	into	the	cab	with	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	drove,	Little	Bit	said,	"Why'd	they	want	to	hurt	James?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"They	didn't	know	who	they	wanted	to	hurt." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	wouldn't'a'	hurt	us?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	I	don't	think	so." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just	James	an'	Seth?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just	James	and	Seth." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Cause	of	Francy?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p477"></a>"That's	what	they	say.	But	Francy's	a	free	woman." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"An'	James	is	a	free	man?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's	Cal?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	know,"	Pa	said.	"But	he	isn't	anyone	who	knows	anything	about being	free." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	nodded.	"You	can	say	that	again." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	smiled	at	her,	and	we	drove	on	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	Dogland,	Seth	and	Francy	ran	toward	us.	"Where's	James?	Where's	Ethorne?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Coming,"	Pa	said.	"James	got	jumped	by	Cal	Carter	and	some	others,	but he	didn't	get	too	badly	hurt,	'cause	they	thought	Francy	was	goin'	off with	Seth." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	God,"	Francy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	okay,"	Little	Bit	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	they	are,"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	truck	that	Seth	and	James	owned	came	into	the	parking	area	and stopped	beside	us.	James	started	to	say	something	as	he	got	out	of	it, but	Francy	threw	her	arms	around	him,	and	they	kissed.	I	didn't	want	to stare,	because	kissing	was	embarrassing,	but	I	had	never	seen	a	black and	a	white	person	kiss	like	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	said,	"You	better	save	that	till	you're	on	the	other	side	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p478"></a>Mason-Dixon	line." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	said,	"The	one	time	you	bein'	cautious,	you	cuttin'	in	on	my	fun." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francy	rubbed	her	mouth,	then	rubbed	lipstick	from	James	and	said,	"He's right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"You	two	best	get	goin'.	Once	they	lick	their	wounds,	they might	be	back." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	said,	"All	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Let	us	know	where	you	settle.	You	forget	anything,	we send	it	on." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	said,	"Think	on	Canada	or	France." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francy	looked	at	Pa.	"Say	goodbye	to	Susan	for	me,	please." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"She'll	be	sorry	she	missed	seeing	you	off." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,"	said	Francy,	then	hugged	Pa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stood	there,	letting	her,	then	said,	"Don't	be	making	James	jealous." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	said,	"Mist'	Luke--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	stuck	out	his	hand.	"Don't	forget	to	write." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francy	said,	"Ethorne,	when	we	find	a	good	place,	you	got	to	come	live with	us." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	shook	his	head.	"I	done	my	searchin'.	Now	it's	you	folks'	turn." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	told	Francy,	"I	know	I	joshed	you	some	'bout	bein'	white--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francy	hugged	him,	kissed	his	cheek,	and	said,	"When	your	mouth	is	shut, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p479"></a>you're	as	nice	as	your	brother." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	laughed.	"Seth	is	blushing!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	said,	"Take	care,	brother." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	said,	"I	ought	to	be	tellin'	you	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	smiled.	"You	the	one	stayin'	in	the	South." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,"	said	Seth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hug	the	boy,"	Ethorne	said.	"They	got	to	get	goin'." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	brothers	embraced,	then	Ethorne	and	James	did.	Ethorne	said,	"Up north	ain't	that	much	easier.	An'	I	know	you	always	been	the	sensible one,	but	remember,	you	got	two	to	look	out	for	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francy	touched	her	stomach.	"Three." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	smiled,	then	put	his	hand	where	Francy's	had	been. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	yelled,	"Hug	me!	Hug	me!"	So	she	got	lifted	up	by	James	and Francy.	She	asked,	"What	about	your	little	baby?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francy	smiled.	"Don't	worry.	My	sister's	taking	good	care	of	her."	Then she	looked	at	me	and	said,	"Can	you	stand	some	girl	cooties?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	down	and	nodded,	and	she	kissed	me,	too.	I	marched	to	James	and stuck	out	my	hand.	He	took	it	and	said,	"So	long,	pardner." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	long,	pardner,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pardner,"	Digger	said,	and	he	received	the	same	treatment	that	I	had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Get,"	Pa	said.	"It's	not	like	we	never	expect	to	see	you	again." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p480"></a>Francy	and	James	scrambled	into	the	cab,	and	the	truck	kicked	up	gravel as	it	drove	up	onto	the	highway.	As	they	drove	away,	Ethorne	said,	"You never	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"Why're	you	cryin',	Ethorne?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Danged	if	I	know,	Mis'	Li'l	Bit.	You	think	it'd	get	easier	to	say	g'bye as	you	get	older,	but	it's	the	other	way	'round	entirely." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"You	want	to	come	in,	have	something	to	drink?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	shook	his	head.	"Nah.	Seth	an'	I	best	head	on	home." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Want	to	ride?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	asked	Seth,	"What	you	think?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	a	nice	night	for	a	walk,"	he	replied	after	a	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thanks,	Luke,"	Ethorne	said,	and	the	two	of	them	wandered	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	night,	Little	Bit	and	I	described	how	the	rifle	had	gone	off	and Ethorne	had	fallen	down.	When	we	had	finished,	Ma	said,	"Someone could've	been	killed." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"It	was	an	accident.	Either	Cal	didn't	mean	to	fire,	or	he meant	to	shoot	into	the	air." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	like	it,	Luke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can't	say	I	like	it	either.	But	it's	over	now.	Who's	left	to	cause trouble?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	only	looked	at	him	and	shook	her	head.	He	laughed,	and	put	his	hand</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p481"></a>on	her	shoulder,	and	as	they	hugged,	Little	Bit	nudged	me	and	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p482"></a>In	April,	after	the	U.S.	government	helped	negotiate	a	contract	between steel	companies	and	unions	to	avoid	a	raise	in	the	cost	of	steel,	six companies	raised	the	cost	anyway,	then	lowered	it	after	Kennedy	accused them	of	"a	wholly	unjustifiable	and	irresponsible	defiance	of	the	public interest."	Republicans	said	the	president	shouldn't	interfere	with	free enterprise,	but	Pa	and	I	were	Democrats,	so	we	were	glad	the	President had	been	tough.	In	New	Orleans,	three	Catholic	segregationists	were excommunicated.	In	response,	white	protesters	marched	carrying	signs such	as,	"Have	socialist	agents	infiltrated	the	Catholic	church? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Integration	is	part	of	the	international	Communist	criminal	conspiracy!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	"Jesus	was	born	of	the	House	of	David	of	pure	white	stock	in	Judea, a	white	country.	It	is	our	sacred	duty	to	preserve	the	white	race	of Jesus!"	A	&amp;	P	Groceries	began	giving	trading	stamps	with	every	sale;	we kids	would	help	Ma	paste	green	stamps	into	booklets	that	could	be	mailed away	for	gifts,	including	toys.	The	X-15	plane	set	a	new	record	by flying	46.7	miles	above	California.	Jordy	and	Ronnie	and	I	would	pretend to	be	X-15	pilots	because	that	was	the	best	airplane;	astronauts	went into	space,	but	all	they	got	to	do	was	ride	in	a	tiny	capsule,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">"X-15"	sounded	a	lot	neater	than	"Atlas	rocket." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	May,	the	first	nuclear	warhead	was	test	fired	from	a	Polaris</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p483"></a>submarine.	President	Kennedy	sent	troops	and	planes	to	Thailand	to prevent	a	Communist	attack	from	Laos,	where	Red	Chinese	were	helping Laotian	communists.	Red	Chinese	were	communists	who	did	not	have	nuclear bombs	or	space	programs.	Jimmy	Hoffa,	president	of	the	AFL-CIO,	was indicted	for	forcing	a	trucking	company	to	give	him	a	million	dollars; Mr.	Shale	said	mobsters	and	Communists	were	behind	all	unions,	which made	Pa	laugh	and	say	he	could	see	an	argument	for	one	or	the	other,	but that'd	be	quite	a	conspiracy,	which	only	made	Mr.	Shale	nod	and	say</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Indeed,	indeed."	The	stock	market	had	its	greatest	fall	since	1929; Republicans	claimed	President	Kennedy's	intervention	in	the	price	of steel	was	the	reason.	Israel	hung	Adolf	Eichman,	the	Nazi	war	criminal that	Israeli	agents	had	captured	in	Argentina.	Argentina	liked	Nazis, and	Israel	did	not,	but	America	liked	both	Argentina	and	Israel	because they	hated	Communists,	which	should	have	meant	that	Communists	were worse	than	Nazis,	but	Nazis	were	like	the	witch	who	tricked	people	into her	oven	to	bake	them	and	Communists	were	like	Robin	Hood	who	stole	from the	rich	to	gave	to	the	poor,	yet	America	loved	Robin	Hood	and	hated Communists,	which	would	have	confused	me	had	I	thought	about	it,	but	I didn't. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p484"></a>"Huh,"	said	Pa,	folding	the	Dickison	Star	back	on	itself.	"They	printed my	letter." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	did	not	look	up	from	her	ironing.	"That's	why	you	sent	it,	wasn't	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sure.	But	that	didn't	mean	they'd	print	it.	Hey,	kids!	Look	here!"	He pointed	at	the	newspaper.	"There's	your	father's	name." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yayy!"	said	Little	Bit,	and	Digger	clapped	his	hands,	but	they	stayed on	the	foot	of	our	parents'	bed,	watching	the	flickering	gray	antics	of two	astronauts	trapped	in	the	time	of	the	cavemen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Luke	H.	Nix,"	I	read	aloud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're	not	goin'	to	put	that	in	one	of	your	scrapbooks?"	Pa	asked	Ma, who	had	picked	up	a	scissors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	course.	Your	letter	to	the	editor	right	beside	Chris's	spelling assignments." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Whatever	makes	you	happy."	Pa	picked	up	his	pipe	and	tobacco	and	walked outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Dear	ed.	Editor,"	I	read.	"I	have	been	si.	Silent	for	sev-er-al	years now.	But	Dir.	Doctor	Lamont's	letter	has	pro.	Provoked	me	to	write. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"What's	that	mean?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Against	the	law." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh.	When	south-ern	states	spend	four	times	as	much	on	Cau-casian students	as	on	Negroes,	it	should	be	ob-vi.	Obvious	that	the	edu-cation is	not	equal.

<p class="calibre1">"Very	good." </p>

<p class="calibre1">"What?"	Ma	looked	back	over	her	shoulder	at	the	newspaper	page. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pointed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	said,	"Union." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh.	Union	over	the	Con-fed.	Confederacy!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p486"></a>"But	it's	merely	doing	what's	right.	There's	no	ra-ci." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Racial." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Racial	ten-sion	in	Latchahie	County.	White	people	and	colored	people get	along	here.	Their	children	would	get	along	in	school,	too.

<p class="calibre1">Ma	was	looking	toward	the	yard	rather	than	at	me.	I	said,	"Was	that	right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded	and	smiled.	"You	read	very	well." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why's	it	say	Hawkins	Spring?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This	whole	area's	called	Hawkins	Spring.	The	motel,	both	gas	stations, Mr.	Shale's,	Don	and	Roger's	Suwannee	Gifts,	Pirate's	Paradise--it's	all called	Hawkins	Spring.	It	hasn't	been	incorporated	to	become	a	town	like Dickison." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	our	address,"	said	Little	Bit	as	Speedy	the	Alka-Seltzer	boy tapdanced	on	television. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	right,"	Ma	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p487"></a>"So	people	will	know	where	we	are,"	Little	Bit	said. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The	next	morning	on	the	bus,	Wayne	Lawson	stopped	in	the	aisle	beside	my seat.	"Your	daddy's	that	nigger-lover." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	not!"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	Lawson	laughed.	"My	Daddy	read	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	coul'n't	read	it!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	eyes	widened	just	as	the	bus	driver	called,	"Wayne	Lawson!	You forgot	how	to	put	your	bottom	into	a	seat?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several	kids	laughed.	Wayne	Lawson	jerked	his	head	toward	the	bus driver,	said,	"No,	ma'am!"	glared	at	me,	then	walked	on	to	sit	near	the back	of	the	bus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh	oh,"	Ronnie	whispered	beside	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Pam	got	on,	she	sat	in	the	seat	in	front	of	us,	swiveled	sideways, and	said,	"Chris,	you	really	want	to	go	to	school	with	niggers?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	we	gotta.	It's	the	law." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ain't." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That'd	be	a	stupid	law." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p488"></a>"It's	still	the	law." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Says	who?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My	Ma." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh."	She	turned	around,	and	I	thought	the	matter	was	resolved.	But	at school,	after	Bible	reading,	Pam	raised	her	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Howe	smiled	at	her.	"Pamela." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mis'	Howe,	is	it	the	law	that	niggers	gotta	go	to	school	with	us?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Negroes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	ma'am." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Howe	picked	up	a	piece	of	chalk,	looked	at	me,	then	looked	at	Pam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	not	the	law	in	Latchahie	County,"	she	said	kindly,	and	began	to write	the	new	words	for	the	day	on	the	chalkboard:	Black.	White.	Red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blue.	Yellow.	Green.	Purple.	Orange. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	recess	on	the	playground,	Pam,	Roxie,	Ronnie,	and	I	were	playing marbles	when	Wayne	Lawson	and	several	older	boys	approached	us.	One asked,	"You	really	a	nigger-lover?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pam	said,	"Y'all	go	'way,	Wayne	Lawson.	You	can't	play." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who	wants	to	play	with	girls?"	asked	Wayne	Lawson.	"Don't	Chris	know if'n	he's	a	nigger-lover?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	no	point	in	looking	for	a	teacher	to	point	out	that	Wayne	was calling	names,	because	he	would	have	already	looked,	and	even	if	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p489"></a>teacher	heard	him,	he	squeak	by	on	the	technicality	that	he	had	asked rather	than	called.	I	said,	"I	don't	love	any	Negroes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh."	The	boy	frowned	at	Wayne	Lawson,	and	Pam	frowned	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"I	like	some	Negroes,	but	I	don'	love	none." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	second	boy	smiled.	"Oh,	he's	a	nigger-liker." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	like	niggers,"	Wayne	Lawson	said.	The	others	stared	at	him,	and	he grinned.	"Ever'one	should	own	one."	As	they	laughed,	I	walked	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	Lawson	called,	"Bye-bye,	nigger-liker!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	school	bus	home,	I	sat	within	a	couple	of	seats	of	the	front.	I tried	to	look	at	a	library	picture	book	about	Daniel	Boone,	but	I	kept listening	for	Wayne	Lawson.	Every	time	I	heard	him	laugh,	my	shoulders tightened.	Nothing	happened	until	we	got	to	his	stop.	As	he	passed	my seat,	he	flicked	a	spitball	against	my	ear.	"Owie!"	I	said,	and	he looked	back	and	laughed.	I	watched	him	and	his	sister	get	off	the	bus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	drove	away	from	the	Lawson's	farm,	Ronnie	said,	"Wayne	Lawson's	a big	bully." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah,"	I	agreed.	"Big	fat	bully	ugly	doodoobughead.	And	he's	stupid." </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	we	laughed	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	Dogland,	I	entered	the	restaurant	and	climbed	on	a	stool	at	the counter.	Lurleen	said,	"Hey,	Chris,	you	thirsty?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes'm." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p490"></a>She	poured	me	a	glass	of	milk	and	went	back	to	reading	a	movie	magazine about	Elizabeth	Taylor	and	Tony	Curtis.	I	banged	the	bar	of	the	drinking straw	dispenser	and	was	building	a	froth	of	bubbles	on	the	surface	of	my milk	when	Ma	came	in.	She	said,	"Hi,	Chris.	How	was	school?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mmm.	Okay." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Learn	anything	new?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Noah	had	a	ark.	He	put	a	momma	and	a	poppa	of	every	kind	of	animal	on it,	and	when	God	flooded	the	whole	earth,	it	rained	for	forty	days,	but it	was	okay	because	they	were	all	in	the	ark." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	see	why	that	makes	you	sad." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	there	was	a	momma	and	a	poppa	of	every	animal,	did	Noah	let	all	the animal	kids	get	drownded?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	Noah	wouldn't	do	that.	I'm	sure	Noah	wouldn't	do	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	Mrs.	Howe	said	there	was	just	two	of	everything." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	there	were	just	two	of	the	Nixes	before	you	were	born." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	an'	Pa?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	right.	None	of	the	animals	had	kids,	I'm	sure.	They	were	all born	after	the	ark	landed." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh.	Okay." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	why	the	sad	face?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're	not	s'pose	to	say	nigger,	right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p491"></a>"That's	right.	Did	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head.	"Wayne	Lawson	says	I'm	a	nigger-liker." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma's	lips	tightened,	and	then	she	said,	"I'll	talk	to	your	father." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Will	he	spank	Wayne	Lawson?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No.	You	don't	spank	other	people's	kids." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	laughed.	"Would	it	make	you	happy	if	someone	spanked	Wayne	Lawson?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	I	don't	think	that's	likely.	But	we'll	see	what	we	can	do,	all right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded,	slurped	the	last	of	my	milk,	and	ran	outside	to	play	with	my plastic	army	men.	When	I	heard	Pa	yell,	"Chris!"	I	abandoned	my	army	in the	dirt	and	ran	as	fast	as	I	could	toward	his	voice.	I	heard	the	tone that	sometimes	meant	a	spanking.	The	longer	Pa	waited,	the	madder	he got;	it	was	best	to	get	up	there	and	take	whatever	punishment	might	be coming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stood	at	the	back	of	the	restaurant.	I	skidded	on	the	gravel	in	front of	him	and	stood	as	straight	as	a	soldier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did	some	boy	call	you	a	name?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did	you	do	anything	to	him	first?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p492"></a>"No,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What'd	he	call	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	nigger-liker." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	blinked.	"Not	a	nigger-lover?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	sir.	He	as'ed	if	I	was	a	nigger-lover." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What'd	you	tell	him?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	said	I	liked	some	Negroes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	squinted	at	me,	then	smiled.	"So	he	was	tellin'	the	truth." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought,	then	said	hesitantly,	"Yes,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	right."	He	sat	on	the	sidewalk	and	patted	the	concrete.	"Sit	a minute,	Chris."	I	sat	and	looked	up	at	him.	He	said,	"When	you	get	in trouble	on	your	own,	I	can't	say	I	feel	good	about	it,	but	I	figure	a kid	has	to	make	mistakes	to	learn	from	them.	But	when	you	get	in	trouble</p>
<p class="calibre1">'cause	of	something	I	did,	I	feel	bad	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	regret	writing	that	letter	to	the	editor,	mind	you,	and	I'll probably	be	writing	another	one.	But	I	regret	this	being	hard	on	you	and your	mother." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"On	Ma?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Somebody	called	up	late	last	night,	cussed	her	out,	and	hung	up	without leaving	his	name.	World's	full	of	cowards." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Coward,"	I	repeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p493"></a>"You	know	how	I	tell	you	about	doing	the	right	thing,	no	matter	what? </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's	not	just	about	admitting	when	you've	done	something	wrong.	It's about	doing	what's	right	when	everyone	else	is	doing	something	wrong." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're	not	s'posed	to	tell	on	people." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	this	is	different.	First	off,	if	someone	does	something	really	bad, you	know	you're	s'posed	to	tell.	Second	off,	when	everyone	around	you	is doin'	something	bad,	there's	no	one	you	can	tell.	That's	when	you	got	to go	ahead	and	do	what's	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Like	a	cowboy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	smiled.	"Like	a	cowboy.	Whenever	something's	wrong,	you	ask	yourself what	a	cowboy	would	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	made	a	gun	with	my	finger	and	shot	him.	"Pow-pow-pow!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	did	not	laugh.	"You	don't	start	fights,	but	you	finish	'em.	You	do what	needs	to	be	done,	and	you	don't	walk	away	from	trouble." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Okay." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind	us,	Artie	Drake	said,	"You	forgot	to	tell	him	to	kiss	his	horse." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	laughed.	"The	boy	already	knows	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's	going	on?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh.	Chris	had	a	little	trouble	in	school." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wayne	Lawson	said	I'm	a	nigger-liker." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	smiled.	"Which	Chris	agrees	he	is,	but	which	doesn't	seem	to	make	him</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p494"></a>happy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	Lawsons,"	Mr.	Drake	said.	"There's	a	bunch	that	breeds	true." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ignorance	begets	ignorance." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	Lawsons	beget	a	lot	of	ignorance." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	smell,"	I	added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	frowned.	"Don't	make	fun	of	folks	for	things	they	can't	help." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	shook	his	head.	"Then	you	won't	make	fun	of	'em	for	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	think	people	can	overcome	their	past?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	man	can,"	Pa	said.	"Or	he	isn't	much	of	a	man." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	laughed.	"Why	is	it	you	champions	of	tolerance	are	so	damned intolerant?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	comes	a	time	to	say	enough's	enough;	what's	wrong	is	stopping here	and	stopping	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	sat	beside	us.	He	reached	into	his	shirt	pocket	for	a	pack	of Camels,	my	favorite	brand	of	cigarette	because	I	liked	the	pyramid	and the	palm	tree	and	the	serene	camel	standing	at	an	oasis.	Mr.	Drake offered	a	cigarette	to	Pa,	who	waved	it	away.	Mr.	Drake	tapped	out	one, lit	it	with	an	aluminum	lighter,	and	said,	"Ever	read	Churchill's	essay about	if	the	South	had	won	the	Civil	War?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	at	him.	"No." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p495"></a>"I	can	lend	it	to	you.	It	got	me	thinking	about	race	relations	and	the War	Between	the	States." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	put	his	cigarette	to	his	lips.	"Seems	to	me	there's	two scenarios.	The	first	is	Lincoln	lets	the	South	go.	No	war.	Constitution doesn't	say	states	can't	secede.	There	wasn't	a	lot	of	support	up	North for	a	war.	It	could've	happened." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	in	terms	of	industrialization,	the	South	was	about	ten	years behind	the	North.	Without	a	war,	we	would've	been	well	on	our	way	from an	agricultural	to	an	industrial	economy	by	1870	or	so.	Slavery	doesn't make	sense	in	an	industrial	economy.	You	want	workers	you	use	when you're	busy	and	lay	off	when	you're	not,	instead	of	slaves	you	have	to feed	and	house	year	'round.	It	costs	to	keep	slaves,	even	ones	treated no	better'n	valuable	animals.	Second,	international	pressure	on	the	U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">to	end	slavery	would've	continued	on	a	free	Confederacy.	Third,	folks forget	there	were	whites	in	the	South	who	opposed	slavery.	Hell,	most Confederates	weren't	slave-owners,	and	a	lot	of	Yankees	were.	Gen'l	Lee freed	his	slaves,	but	your	Gen'l	Grant	owned	a	couple	through	his	wife that	weren't	freed	till	the	end	of	the	war." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	laughed.	"My	General	Grant?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p496"></a>Mr.	Drake	smiled.	"I	get	a	might	partisan	now	and	then.	Anyway,	it	seems to	me	that	slavery	would've	ended	by	1890	at	the	latest,	when	Cuba	ended slavery." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Twenty-five	extra	years	of	slavery	doesn't	sound	like	an	improvement." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're	not	seeing	the	whole	picture.	A	free	Confederacy	wouldn't've	had to	indulge	itself	in	Jim	Crow	laws	or	lynchings	or	any	of	the	horrors	of segregation." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Um,"	Pa	said,	which	meant	he	was	still	listening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	I'm	not	saying	things'd	be	perfect.	But	southern	whites	and	Negroes both'd	be	wealthier'n	they	are	today.	You	wouldn't	have	had	the millions,	white	and	black,	Northern	and	Southern,	killed	during	the	war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	wouldn't	have	the	repercussions	of	all	that	dying	passed	from generation	to	generation.	You'd	just	have	folks	of	different	colors workin'	side	by	side	to	build	a	better	world." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sounds	nice,"	Pa	said.	"What's	your	second	scenario?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	looked	at	the	ash	on	his	cigarette,	flicked	it	onto	the gravel,	and	took	another	drag.	"Say	the	war	was	fought,	but	the	South won.	There	were	times	when	that	looked	likely.	Even	a	victorious	war drains	resources.	The	Confederacy	was	trying	to	get	European	recognition to	get	loans,	but	slavery	was	a	major	obstacle.	Enough	that	Gen'l	Lee and	Judah	P.	Benjamin--Jefferson	Davis's	Secretary	of	State	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p497"></a>first	Jewish	cabinet	official	in	North	America--both	recommended	that the	South	free	the	slaves	in	1864.	Davis	over-ruled	'em.	By	then,	the South	probably	couldn't	have	won	anyway,	not	with	foreign	help	or	God's. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	s'pose	Lee	won	at	Antietam,	before	Lincoln	issued	the	Emancipation Proclamation--which,	by	the	way,	only	freed	slaves	in	states	that'd rebelled	and	didn't	affect	Union	slave	states	like	Maryland	or	Delaware. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	the	war	ends	by	early	'63.	The	Confederacy's	industrial	base	has	been battered,	but	it	hasn't	been	destroyed.	England	and	France	both'd	see	a chance	to	make	money	by	lending	it,	but	slavery's	still	an	obstacle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	Gen'l	Lee's	a	war	hero,	so	his	feelings	would	mean	a	lot	to Confederates.	Judah	Benjamin's	a	respected	man,	too,	even	if	he	is	a Jew.	Add	the	fact	that	an	awful	lot	of	slaves	helped	the	Southern	war effort,	whether	they	wanted	to	or	not.	There	was	a	battalion	of	colored slave	owners	and	free	men	in	Louisiana	who	volunteered	to	fight	for	the Confederacy.	Southerners	are	a	proud	and	contrary	bunch,	as	you	may've noticed.	It	would've	been	a	damn	sight	easier	for	a	victorious Confederacy	to	free	the	slaves	than	it	is	for	a	defeated	one	to	give	the Negro	any	real	equality." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"That's	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	sir,	that's	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	a	pretty	fantasy.	But	none	of	us	live	in	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p498"></a>Mr.	Drake	grinned.	"Maybe	not,	Luke.	But	you	got	to	consider	the possibility	that	force	hurts	your	cause." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	long	d'you	have	to	consider	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	looked	at	him.	"What	do	you	mean?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've	known	some	Negroes	in	my	time.	First	ones	I	met	to	say	I	knew	were in	the	service.	Hardly	ever	saw	one	while	I	was	growing	up,	but	I	did see	a	few."	Pa	took	out	his	pipe	and	a	bag	of	Prince	Albert,	tapped tobacco	into	the	bowl	with	his	index	finger,	and	lit	the	pipe	as	he talked.	"My	Pa	wasn't	much	interested	in	race	relations,	prob'ly	'cause it	didn't	affect	his	daily	life,	but	I	remember	when	I	was	a	boy,	we went	on	a	driving	vacation,	and	we	took	along	my	cousin,	a	boy	about	my age	who	spent	the	summer	with	us.	One	afternoon,	we	stopped	at	a	lake	to swim.	My	cousin	started	for	the	beach,	then	stopped	cold	in	his	tracks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	Negro	kids	were	playing	in	the	water	while	their	folks	watched them.	My	Pa	asked	my	cousin,	who	was	blocking	the	path,	'What's	the matter,	don't	you	want	to	go	swimming	after	all?'	And	my	cousin	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Uncle	Wade,	there's	niggers	in	the	lake!'	My	Pa	looked	at	my	cousin	and said,	'It's	a	mighty	big	lake.'	And	we	all	went	swimming,	even	my	cousin." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"That's	hardly	an	example	of	force." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh."	Pa	puffed	on	his	pipe.	"It	wasn't	till	I	was	in	the	merchant marine	that	I	got	to	know	a	few	Negroes.	Used	to	swap	cowboy	books	with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p499"></a>one.	Decent	guy.	After	the	war,	in	'46,	I	heard	about	Isaac	Woodard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Remember	him?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can't	say	I	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	was	a	Negro	vet	just	discharged	and	heading	home	on	a	bus.	At	one stop,	he	asked	the	bus	driver	if	he	could	get	out	to	use	the	rest	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	driver	said	no.	That's	one	of	those	things	that	happens	under segregation.	Petty	officials	with	discretionary	powers	use	'em	in	petty ways.	Driver'll	let	whites	off	to	use	the	rest	room,	but	he'll	tell Negroes	he	isn't	stopping	long	enough	to	let	everyone	off.	If	they	get off	anyway,	he	won't	let	'em	back	on	the	bus	without	buying	a	new ticket.	Rinkydink	harrassment." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Which	is	wrong." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sure.	But	it	happened,	and	you	can't	deny	it	still	happens.	Anyway, Woodard	got	in	an	argument	with	the	bus	driver.	Might've	been	a	bit	of	a scuffle.	I	don't	know	whether	anyone	hit	anyone.	What	I	do	remember	is that	at	the	next	stop,	in	a	little	town	in	South	Carolina,	the	driver told	a	cop	that	Woodard	had	been	making	trouble.	The	cop	took	Woodard off	the	bus,	beat	him	with	his	billy	club,	then	hauled	him	off	to	the local	jail.	And	in	that	jail,	that	cop	took	his	club	and	mashed	out Woodard's	eyes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	puffed	twice	on	his	pipe.	Mr.	Drake	and	I	waited	for	him	to	continue. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p500"></a>"Did	I	say	Woodard	was	still	wearing	his	army	uniform?	There	was	a	big stink	about	the	case,	since	the	choice	of	victim	and	the	choice	of punishment	were	so	extreme,	even	for	the	South.	Something	like	twenty thousand	dollars	was	raised	in	New	York,	which	didn't	do	a	damn	thing	to restore	Woodard's	sight.	But	it	added	to	the	press	attention,	which	got the	FBI	to	look	into	it.	The	cop	was	tried	for	violating	Woodard's	civil rights.	Which	was	news	right	there,	a	cop	tried	for	something	done	to	a Negro. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	jury	acquitted	that	cop	in	half	an	hour.	For	all	I	know,	he's	the chief	of	police	of	that	town	today.	When	I	heard	about	Woodard,	I	just thought	about	the	fellows	I	knew	in	the	service,	and	how	it	could've been	any	one	of	'em.	No	point	in	trading	cowboy	books	with	a	blind	guy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	if	things	had	been	different--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	weren't.	And	they	aren't." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	studied	Pa,	then	said,	"No.	You've	got	to	do	what	you've	got to	do,	I	guess." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	the	size	of	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	can	still	be	cautious." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	smiled.	"I	thought	I'd	been	pretty	good	at	keeping	my	head	down.	I'm not	looking	for	trouble." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well.	Integration'll	be	fought	out	in	the	big	cities.	It	doesn't	have</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p501"></a>to	touch	Latchahie	County." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"True." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	blew	a	smoke	ring.	I	carefully	poked	my	finger	in	its	center as	it	expanded.	Mr.	Drake	asked	Pa,	"You	think	the	idea	of	race	is	here to	stay?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	do	you	mean?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	a	new	notion	historically.	The	word's	old,	but	it	just	meant offspring,	or	a	group	of	similar	things.	You	find	old	references	to	the Irish	race,	the	race	of	women,	the	race	of	heroes--you	could	say	Chris there's	of	the	race	of	Nix.	It	wasn't	until	the	seventeen	hundreds	that people	began	dividing	humanity	by	race.	An	early	idea	was	for	five races,	Caucasian,	Mongolian,	Ethiopian,	American,	and	Malay." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head.	"Caucasian,	Oriental,	an'	Negro." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"That's	what	they	teach	today.	But	there's	no	basis	for race	other	than	human.	You	can't	tell	whether	donated	blood's	from	a Negro,	a	Jew,	a	Chinaman,	or	a	Caucasian.	When	they	find	bones	of cavemen,	there's	no	way	to	know	what	color	their	skin	was.	If	you	want to	test	for	race,	all	you	can	do	is	look	at	people	and	guess." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Maybe	my	best	friend	in	the	Merchant	Marine	was	a	blond	Jew named	Sam.	We	used	to	go	on	leave	together	sometimes.	In	New	York	right after	the	war,	two	geezers	in	beards	and	black	suits	and	hats	came	up</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p502"></a>and	started	jabbering	at	me.	I	thought	they	were	Mennonites	or something.	Sam	starts	grinning.	The	more	they	jabber,	the	more	annoyed they	get,	and	the	more	Sam	grins.	I'm	going,	'Sorry,	I	don't	understand, do	you	speak	English?'	Sam	isn't	helping	at	all.	Finally	the	old	men walk	off,	all	disgusted.	Sam's	laughing	like	he's	going	to	bust	a	gut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	finally	calms	down	enough	to	talk,	he	says	the	old	guys	figured I	was	Jewish.	They	were	disgusted	'cause	they	thought	I	was	either	an American	Jew	who'd	never	learned	the	old	language	or	I	knew	the	language but	wasn't	letting	on	in	front	of	my	blond	goy	friend.	When	they	left, they	were	mumbling	'bout	the	state	of	the	house	of	David.	And	Sam,	who's first-generation	and	speaks	Yiddish	or	Hebrew	or	whatever	the	hell	it was	like	he'd	been	born	over	there,	thought	watching	this	was	flat	out hilarious." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	laughed.	"It	is." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah,	right,"	Pa	said,	pretending	he	didn't	agree,	which	made	me	grin more.	Then	he	asked	Mr.	Drake,	"Don't	you	ever	want	to	share	what	you know	with	your	neighbors?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	do.	Anybody	in	the	county'll	tell	you	I'm	the	biggest	bore	around when	it	comes	to	history	and	race." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	get	calls	in	the	middle	of	the	night?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	glanced	at	Pa.	"Do	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p503"></a>"Prob'ly	kids." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said	somberly,	"I	don't	write	letters	to	the	Star	saying	white people	should	change	the	way	they	do	things	down	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh.	Maybe	you're	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	it	won't	stop	you	from	writing	your	next	letter." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	laughed.	"It's	already	in	the	mail. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p504"></a>In	the	summer	of	'62,	the	state	began	turning	the	road	in	front	of Dogland	from	two	lanes	into	four.	Ma	and	Pa	were	both	pleased,	thinking that	would	keep	more	tourists	on	the	old	route.	I	was	pleased	because when	the	construction	crews	were	away,	I	had	a	private	road	to	wobble along	on	my	bicycle.	I	was	forbidden	to	go	farther	than	the	Fountain	of Youth	to	the	north	or	Gideon's	19-cent	Hamburgers	to	the	south,	but	that was	freedom	from	Dogland	where	Pa	might	notice	me	doing	nothing	and think	of	a	chore	that	could	use	doing.	I	went	for	a	ride	or	two	on	most days,	and	my	bicycle	wobbled	less	and	less.	Sometimes	I	would	see	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">DeLyon,	and	she	would	nod	to	me,	and	sometimes	I	would	see	Mr.	Shale, who	would	yell,	"How	you	doin',	Christopher	Nix!	You	keep	helpin'	the Lord	to	help	you,	hear?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	summer,	the	Supreme	Court	ruled	that	a	New	York	school	prayer violated	the	First	Amendment's	separation	of	church	and	state.	Defense Secretary	McNamara	said	that	the	struggle	against	the	Vietnamese Communists	might	take	a	long	time,	and	North	Vietnam's	Ho	Chi	Minh confirmed	that,	saying	they	were	prepared	to	fight	against	the	South	and the	Americans	for	another	ten	years	if	they	must.	The	U.S.	national	debt topped	$300	billion	for	the	first	time.	Saskatchewan	tested	a	universal medical	insurance	plan	that	became	the	model	for	all	of	Canada's</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p505"></a>provinces.	The	U.S.	exploded	a	nuclear	bomb	at	night	in	the	atmosphere that	was	seen	eight	hundred	miles	away	in	Hawaii,	where	radios	fell silent,	burglar	alarms	rang,	and	streets	lay	dark	as	city	lights	failed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	U.S.	launched	Telstar,	the	world's	first	active	communications satellite;	an	instrumental	named	for	the	satellite	was	the	first	British rock	song	to	hit	Number	One	on	the	American	charts.	The	FDA	concluded that	birth	control	pills	did	not	cause	blood	clotting	and	therefore	were safe	to	sell	to	the	American	public.	Marilyn	Monroe,	William	Faulkner, and	Herman	Hesse	died.	Ringo	Starr	joined	the	Beatles.	On	my	birthday, the	President	said	two	U.S.	nuclear-powered	subs	had	traveled	from	the Atlantic	and	the	Pacific	to	meet	under	the	polar	ice,	which	told Americans	that	our	scientific	power	was	supreme,	and	told	the	rest	of the	world	the	same	thing	about	our	military	reach.	Marvel	Comics introduced	Thor	and	Spider-Man.	Peter	Parker	was	a	social	outcast	bitten by	a	radioactive	spider;	though	he	gained	powers	and	a	costume,	he remained	an	outcast	who	fought	human	freaks.	I	preferred	the	lame	but courageous	Dr.	Don	Blake	who	found	a	gnarled	wooden	cane	that,	struck against	the	ground,	transformed	him	into	a	long-haired,	clean-shaven	god of	thunder	who	battled	space	aliens	made	of	gray	stone. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p506"></a>maybe	Pa	had	decided	to	take	a	week	off	and	we	had	driven	to	the Appalachian	mountains	to	sleep	in	tents	and	be	in	a	place	that	was nothing	like	Florida	or	Minnesota,	maybe	we	were	making	one	of	Pa's	many sign	posting	tours,	when	he	and	a	few	or	all	of	us	would	put	wooden Dogland	signs	in	the	back	of	the	station	wagon	and	then	go	driving	to find	places	where	bemused	property	owners	would	let	us	post	a	sign	for	a very	low	rent.	All	I	remember	with	certainty	(which	is	not	the	same	as for	sure)	is	that	we	were	returning	to	Dogland,	and	we	stopped	to	climb the	tower	of	Vulcan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stairs	are	wonderful,	as	all	kids	and	cats	know,	especially	if	you	live in	a	house	without	stairs	and	your	Grandma	and	Grandpa	live	in	a	house with	lots	of	stairs.	The	most	wonderful	stairs	are	curved	and	go forever,	so	you	can't	see	far	ahead	or	behind	you	as	you	run	ahead	of your	parents,	who	puff	and	puff	and	laugh	about	how	much	energy	you have.	I	raced	ahead	of	Digger	and	Little	Bit	to	burst	through	the	door at	the	top	of	the	tower.	And	I	could	not	move.	A	cold	wind	struck	me, and	the	world	fell	away	forever.	I	pressed	myself	against	the	wall.	I did	not	think	the	tower	would	fall.	I	knew	I	would. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	summer	the	O'Donohues	bought	land	next	to	Dogland	and	built	a	gift shop	and	a	kennel	for	raising	and	selling	Chihuahuas.	The	O'Donohues	are not	a	major	part	of	my	story,	though	they	might	have	been	a	major	part</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p507"></a>of	Pa's	or	Ma's.	They	were	an	older	couple	who	had	bought	stock	in Dogland,	and	I	soon	overheard	enough	conversations	between	Ma	and	Pa	to know	the	O'Donohues	had	decided	to	move	to	Florida	and	be	in	a	better position	to	oversee	their	investment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	had	an	adopted	son	who	was	blind.	He	was	several	years	older	than	I was,	and	taller	and	stronger.	I	remember	Little	Bit,	Digger,	and	I	going over	to	play	with	him	once,	and	we	all	had	squirt	guns.	He	had	the	most powerful	one,	and	his	blindness	did	not	seem	to	hinder	him.	I	thought	he was	mean.	Ma	said	we	should	feel	sorry	for	him	because	he	was	blind,	and now	I	have	no	idea	whether	he	hurt	us	when	we	played	because	he	could not	see,	or	whether	hurting	us	gave	him	a	tiny	bit	of	the	power	that	the world	had	kept	from	him.	I'm	sure	we	had	to	visit	him	more	than	once	to play	with	him.	He	spent	most	of	the	year	boarding	in	a	special	school, so	I	never	really	had	a	chance	to	get	to	know	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	Hawkins	Spring,	several	new	terrors	added	themselves	to	the	mystery of	the	old	dance	hall	and	the	eerie	nature	of	the	long	sawgrass	that grew	around	the	swimming	area.	Once,	when	we	kids	paddled	out	to	the raft	made	of	wood	and	empty	metal	barrels,	we	climbed	aboard,	then	heard something	move	within	it:	something	like	a	thick,	dark	rope	was	coiled between	the	barrels	and	the	wood.	We	leaped	back	into	the	water	and splashed	ashore	more	quickly	than	ever	before.	The	water	moccasin	raced, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p508"></a>perhaps	as	quickly	and	with	as	much	fear,	across	the	clear	water	for safety	in	the	swampy	stretch	of	lilies	and	cypress	knees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	particular	terror	never	returned.	We	learned	to	swim	to	the	raft and	circle	it,	examining	the	shadows	to	be	sure	nothing	lay	within before	we	climbed	on	top.	We	never	met	another	snake	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	that	was	the	summer	Pa	decided	I	was	old	enough	to	jump	from	the tower	next	to	the	heart	of	the	spring.	We	had	all	laughed	when	Pa	went up	there,	because	we	knew	he	was	bothered	by	heights	and	it	was	funny	to see	him	force	himself	to	dive	as	though	he	did	not	care.	But	soon	Little Bit	and	Digger	began	to	jump	off	the	tower	when	Pa	dived.	Since	they were	smaller,	I	had	no	choice.	When	I	hesitated,	Pa	always	said	he	would count	to	three.	On	"one,"	I	would	stand	with	my	toes	over	the	rough-sawn edge	of	the	boards,	looking	down	at	the	clear	water,	ten	or	fifteen	feet below,	and	think	about	belly	flops	and	water	up	my	nose	and	things	that might	grab	me	and	keep	me	under.	Then	Pa	would	say	"two."	"Three"	meant a	spanking,	so	I	would	leap	before	I	heard	it.	I	was	not	afraid	of	being under	water;	I	liked	swimming	under	water,	with	the	strange	mirror	of the	sky	above	me.	I	hated	plunging	toward	the	bottom,	and	I	dreaded having	my	foot	touch	something	unknown,	something	soft	and	oozy.	Divers had	drowned	down	there.	I	could	imagine	skeletons	in	black	wetsuits	and scuba	gear,	watching	and	smirking.	When	I	surfaced,	I	always	laughed, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p509"></a>not	because	I	had	conquered	my	fears,	but	because	I	had	survived	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p510"></a>One	day	Pa	insisted	Ma	come	along	to	the	springs.	He	drove	the	station wagon	past	the	dance	hall	to	the	end	of	the	dirt	road	where	we	rarely went,	near	the	neck	of	the	springs	and	the	Suwannee,	and	we	all	got	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This	way,"	Pa	said,	and	he	led	us	down	a	sandy	path. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	square	wooden	houseboat	with	peeling	gray	paint	was	docked	beneath	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	stern	was	open	to	the	rear	and	either	side,	but	it	was	covered	with a	wooden	deck	on	which	were	mounted	spotlights,	and	the	front	was glassed.	The	deck	over	the	cabin	was	surrounded	by	a	steel	railing	that you	could	hold	as	you	walked	up	either	side	to	the	bow.	Across	the	stern in	white	letters,	someone	had	painted,	"Dixie	Belle." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	turned	to	Ma	and	grinned	as	he	said,	"What	do	you	think?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Umm?"	Ma	said.	"The	boat?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded,	and	his	smile	began	to	slide	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	it	ours?"	Little	Bit	asked.	"Is	it,	Pa?	Huh,	is	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	laughed.	"That's	right,	little	darling.	The	Dixie	Belle.	It	must've been	named	for	you.	Who	wants	to	go	for	a	ride?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	yelled,	"I	do,	I	do!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	said,	"Me,	too!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Okay." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Well,	sure.	Are	there	life	jackets?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p511"></a>"It's	got	everything,"	Pa	said.	"Wait'll	you	see."	He	went	ahead	on	the dock,	then	stepped	across	and	down	into	the	boat.	"Hold	on."	He	set	an unpainted	wooden	gangplank	between	the	boat	and	the	dock.	"Now,	isn't that	civilized?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	smiled.	"Indeed." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	ran	ahead	of	her,	and	I	followed.	Ma	came	last,	holding Digger's	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait'll	you	hear	the	diesel,"	Pa	said.	"Those	engines	never	get	old." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mmm,"	Ma	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	you	talk	about	a	deal.	No	one	wanted	to	buy	the	boat	'cause	they used	it	to	trawl	for	corpses--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	what?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	was	a	long	time	ago,	Susan.	This	is	a	boat	with	history.	It	was	used by	bootleggers	to	run	alcohol	during	prohibition.	When	the	bootleggers were	caught,	the	state	got	it,	and	I	guess	that's	when	they	used	to	drag the	river	for	bodies.	It's	a	work	horse.	All	it	needs	is	a	coat	of	paint." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mmm,"	said	Ma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	gr-r-r-reat!"	said	Little	Bit	like	Tony	the	Tiger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	open	stern	had	several	benches	with	thin	foam	mattresses,	and	a	high captain's	chair	next	to	the	wheel,	which	fascinated	me,	and	a	door	down a	couple	of	steps	that	fascinated	Little	Bit.	Pa	laughed	and	called, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p512"></a>"Slow	down,	Little	Bit!"	as	she	pushed	the	door	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	and	I	followed	her	in.	The	cabin	was	dark.	Light	came	through small	louvered	windows	at	the	front	and	each	side.	It	had	been	painted an	industrial	color	that	I	no	longer	remember,	light	gray	or	dull	green. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More	wooden	benches	and	foam	mattresses,	like	the	ones	in	the	stern, lined	the	front	and	one	wall.	The	galley	was	to	my	right,	which	was starboard,	which	I	could	never	remember,	because	right	is	a	relative concept	and	starboard	is	a	fixed	one,	and	I	did	not	have	the	language	to clarify	the	difference. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	galley	had	a	gas	range.	"And,	look	at	this,"	Pa	said,	going	to	the sink	and	pumping	the	handle.	"Modern	living!"	The	faucet	gasped	several times,	then	spat	rusty	water.	"That'll	clear,"	Pa	said,	and	he	pumped	it several	more	times	to	prove	he	was	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	got	a	baffroom!"	Little	Bit	called,	opening	a	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"See?	Everything	you	could	want,"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	got	to	use	it,"	Digger	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	when	we're	at	dock,"	Pa	said.	"Only	when	we're	underway,	'cause	it flushes	right	into	the	water." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yuck,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said	patiently,	"That's	why	you	don't	flush	it	when	you're	docked." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	went	to	one	of	the	benches.	"These	fold	up	into	bunk	beds.	You	just</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p513"></a>hook	the	chain.	See?	You	can	tell	they	could	store	a	lot	of	corpses	here--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"I'm	leaving." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	joking,	Susan.	They	probably	stacked	them	in	the	stern.	I	doubt they'd	ever	go	after	more	than	one	or	two	at	a	time	anyway." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Luke--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who	wants	to	go	for	a	ride?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	do,	I	do!"	Little	Bit	sang. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Me,	too,	me,	too,"	Digger	agreed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	let's	go." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Is	it	safe?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Christ,	Susan,	we've	got	life	jackets.	It's	not	like	the	Suwannee's	a wide	river." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	if	we	sank?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	we'd	get	wet." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	laughed,	and	so	did	I.	Ma	looked	at	us,	then	smiled.	"All	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good,"	Pa	said,	and	he	went	up	into	the	stern.	We	followed.	Old musty-smelling	life	jackets	were	stored	under	one	of	the	benches.	They were	orange,	with	rough	cloth	covering	hard	foam	rectangles,	and	they tied	over	your	head	and	onto	your	chest	with	white	straps	that	you pulled	tight.	Everyone	had	to	put	one	on,	except	for	Pa.	As	he	closed the	bench,	he	said,	"That's	probably	where	they	put	the	bodies." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p514"></a>"Luke!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It'd	be	convenient,	you	know,	just	to	drop	them	in	as	soon	as	you pulled	them	up,	and	you	wouldn't	have	to	look	at	them	this	way." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Really,	Luke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who'd	want	to	look	at	them?	They'd	be	all	bloated--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	laughed	again,	and	so	did	I.	Ma	said,	"Please,	Luke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	all	right.	Listen	to	this."	He	drew	back	the	engine	cover	and adjusted	something,	but	I	think	the	engine	started	from	a	push	of	a button	by	the	controls	at	the	wheel.	It	coughed	like	a	volley	of	cannon fire.	Pa	said,	"Purrs	like	a	kitten!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"What?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shouted,	"Purrs	like	a	kitten!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Oh.	Right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	closed	the	engine	cover,	it	ran	quieter,	but	it	was	not	quiet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sounds	of	the	river,	birds	and	fish	and	insects	and	wind,	were	gone, and	the	smells	of	mud	and	water	grasses	and	pine	trees	were	replaced	by the	smell	of	diesel.	Digger	looked	at	the	engine,	then	clapped	his hands,	almost	silently	in	the	rumble,	and	he	laughed,	and	so	did	Pa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	sat	on	the	back	bench	while	Pa	ran	along	the	dock,	thrusting	the	boat out	into	the	springs.	Then	he	leaped	aboard,	ran	to	the	captain's	chair and	the	wheel,	and	worked	something.	Ma	jerked	forward	as	the	propeller</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p515"></a>at	the	rear	coughed	up	a	jet	of	water	and	pressed	us	forward,	not swiftly,	but	powerfully	and	irreversibly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	water	of	the	springs	was	as	clear	as	a	new	window,	but	the	river	was deep	and	dark,	like	looking	through	thick,	green	glass.	Maybe	you	could see	the	tops	of	grasses	growing	within	it,	or	maybe	you	only	saw sunlight	stabbing	into	it,	and	dying.	We	went	under	the	bridge,	turned around,	went	downstream	to	the	first	bend,	turned	again,	and	returned	to the	springs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	came	to	like	the	afternoon	and	weekend	rides	on	the	river.	Pa	bought an	aluminum	duck	boat	that	he	tied	on	top	of	the	Dixie	Belle	as	a	life boat,	and,	like	us,	Ma	wore	an	orange	vest	whenever	she	went	along	the gangway.	She	liked	the	sun,	and	she	liked	Pa's	contentment,	and	she liked	the	time	away	from	Dogland,	I	suspect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Dixie	Belle	added	a	new	terror	to	my	life.	When	it	was	on	the	water, Little	Bit	and	I	often	stood	on	the	bow,	watching	for	logs.	Whenever something	struck	the	bottom	of	the	boat,	I	felt	I	had	failed	Pa	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes	we	went	onto	the	boat	for	an	hour	or	two	and	never	left	the dock.	In	some	ways,	those	times	were	worse.	Digger	and	Little	Bit	liked to	climb	onto	the	deck	above	the	stern	and	jump	into	the	water,	so	I	had to,	also.	As	I	did	on	the	diving	platform	near	the	heart	of	the	springs, I	would	endure	the	threat	of	Pa's	count,	and	the	count	itself	to	two, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p516"></a>and	leap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	the	end	of	summer,	I	must	have	been	diving	off	the	raft	at	Hawkins Spring	and	from	the	spring	board	at	the	pool	at	the	Fountain	of	Youth, but	I	knew	that	people	should	not	throw	themselves	off	anything	higher from	the	water	than	their	waists	when	they	stood	beside	it.	After	we	saw a	boy	about	Little	Bit's	size	dive	from	the	platform	by	the	springs,	Pa made	me	dive	from	it	once	or	twice,	and	once	from	the	top	of	the	Dixie Belle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	dives	from	the	tower	were	not	significantly	different	than	jumping had	been.	If	your	choice	is	to	be	eaten	by	two	tigers	or	five,	most people	would,	I	suspect,	pick	two,	but	not	feel	better	for	having	had the	choice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	remember	the	dive	from	the	top	of	the	Dixie	Belle.	Little	Bit	and Digger	had	both	gone	ahead	of	me	to	show	how	harmless	it	was.	They paddled	in	place	in	the	water,	looking	up	at	me,	and	Pa	counted,	and	Ma watched	with	the	face	that	said	she	would	do	something	if	she	could,	but she	couldn't.	As	always,	I	launched	out	on	"two,"	not	caring	whether	I belly-flopped	or	died.	I	remember	coming	up	in	the	clear	water	with	a strange	delight,	that	I	had	done	this	horrifying	thing	and	had	not	hurt myself	at	all.	That	delight	stayed	with	me	as	I	swam	to	the	side	of	the boat,	climbed	the	plastic	and	aluminum	ladder,	ran	along	the	gangway	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p517"></a>the	bow	to	climb	onto	the	top	of	the	cabin	and	from	there	onto	the	deck above	the	stern.	I	dived	again,	without	anyone	counting.	Maybe	I	dove twice.	I	had	conquered	my	fear,	and	it	felt	wonderful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	day,	I	climbed	the	Dixie	Belle	to	dive,	and	looked	down,	and waited,	and	felt	everyone	watching,	and	told	myself	it	had	been	fun before,	and	jumped	as	though	that	was	all	I	had	ever	wanted	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometime	later,	Pa	told	me	that	fear	doesn't	go	away,	that	people	who aren't	afraid	are	not	brave,	but	fools,	that	you	conquer	fear	by recognizing	it	and	not	letting	it	stop	you	from	doing	what	you	wanted	to do.	That	made	sense	to	me,	but	it	did	not	help.	Fear	had	never	stopped me	from	doing	anything	I	wanted	to	do.	Fear	only	stopped	me	from	doing things	Pa	wanted	me	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	bit,	no	one	expected	me	to	dive	from	any	height.	I	had	proven	to Pa	I	could	if	I	had	to,	which	seemed	to	be	enough	for	everyone	but	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	all	those	fears,	there	was	wonder,	too.	The	fear	of	heights	did	not keep	me	from	loving	to	swim.	The	responsibilities	of	the	Dixie	Belle never	made	me	unable	to	feel	the	joys.	When	you	stand	at	the	bow	of	a boat,	clinging	to	the	front	rail,	squinting	in	the	sunlight,	cold	with	a breeze	that	would	not	exist	without	motion,	whipped	by	your	shirt	and shorts	and	the	straps	of	your	life	vest,	vibrating	with	the	hull	as	it drives	itself	against	the	water,	you	are	as	big	and	as	old	and	as	brave</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p518"></a>as	you	could	ever	want	to	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	August,	I	turned	seven.	You	could	argue	that	any	age	is	the	best age	to	be--I	generally	side	with	those	who	say	that	the	age	you	are	now is	the	best	of	all,	for	you	are,	at	the	very	least,	the	sum	of	your parts.	But	of	the	ages	of	childhood,	seven	years	old	is	among	the	best. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	enough	of	a	big	boy	to	laugh	at	the	idea	of	being	a	big	boy;	that was	a	dream	for	little	kids. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p519"></a>One	day	when	I	was	reading	comic	books	by	the	house,	Mr.	Drake	stopped in	to	see	Pa.	They	spoke	briefly	of	things	that	were	either	pointless	to me,	like	the	weather,	or	boring,	like	sports	or	local	politics.	Then	Pa said,	"So,	was	it	my	latest	letter	to	the	paper	that	brought	you	out?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No."	Mr.	Drake	dropped	his	cigarette	and	ground	it	beneath	a	polished loafer.	"I	quit	the	agency.	Effective	immediately." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Going	independent?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No.	Shutting	down.	Gwenny's	going	off	to	school,	and	I	just	haven't	got the	stomach	to	stay	a	company	man." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	nothing	in	particular.	Well,	all	right,	maybe	it	was	one	too	many trips	trying	to	salvage	a	screw-up	on	a	project	that	should'a'	never been	begun.	Maybe	it's	just	that	I'm	tired	of	taking	orders	without questioning	them." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"I	never	did	find	a	boss	I	could	tolerate	long.	What'll	you	do?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	quitting	means	I'm	bailing	out	of	the	pension	plan,	but	I've	got enough	to	get	Gwenny	through	her	first	year	of	school	and	a	little	bit besides.	I	was	thinking	of	investing	in	Dogland." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mmm."	Pa	tapped	his	pipe	against	the	heel	of	his	engineer	boot,	then spilled	the	ash	onto	the	ground.	"You've	seen	business	isn't	the	greatest." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p520"></a>Mr.	Drake	nodded.	"I	think	I	know	what	I'm	getting	into." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	tough	doing	business	with	friends." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've	heard	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	if	you're	sure,	I	could	line	you	up	with	a	shareholder	or	two who'd	prob'ly	sell	out	at	cost." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"I	don't	mean	to	set	conditions--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	run	Dogland	as	I	see	fit." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	laughed.	"No,	ah,	fooling?	I	just	wanted	to	say	that	after setting	Gwenny's	college	money	aside,	I'll	be	strapped.	I've	been thinking	I'd	like	a	simple	job,	something	outdoors	without	too	much responsibility	that'd	pay	for	my	groceries	and	leave	me	time	to	think about	what	I'm	doing	with	my	life." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're	asking	for	a	job?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	be	damned." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	it	didn't	work	out,	I'd	quit	in	a	second.	A	second	before	you	fired me.	Which	I	wouldn't	want	to	happen." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	studied	Mr.	Drake.	"We're	talking	minimum	wage." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	nodded.	"I	know	a	man	who's	got	a	trailer	house	for	sale.	If	I could	park	it	around	here,	I'd	be	about	set." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,"	Pa	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p521"></a>"Or	I	could	ask	Maggie,	maybe	park	it	back	by	the	springs." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mmm."	Pa	nodded	and	stood.	"Let's	find	Susan	and	talk	this	over.	You planning	to	move	down	here	tomorrow?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hell,	no.	I	got	to	put	my	affairs	in	order	and	put	my	own	house	on	the market."	Mr.	Drake	smiled.	"Maybe	the	day	after	tomorrow?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	reached	out,	and	they	shook	hands.	"Deal." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	looked	at	me.	"You	kids'll	have	to	call	me	Artie	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"All	right,	Artie,	sir." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	and	Pa	laughed.	Mr.	Drake	said,	"Just	Artie.	Got	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled.	"Got	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Susan'll	like	having	someone	else	on	the	grounds	when	I'm away.	We	quit	letting	Ranger	out	at	night	'cause	he	kept	scaring	the locals	when	they	walked	by." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"I	don't	mind	being	a	human	guard	dog." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Fine.	I	should	be	getting	back	to	work." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"I	should	be	going,	too.	I'll	walk	up	with	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"Sure." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"See	you,	Chris." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	laughed	and	waved.	"See	you,	Artie." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	they	walked	away,	Mr.	Drake	said,	"Has	Gideon	Shale	been	acting	oddly lately?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p522"></a>"Not	more'n	usual,"	Pa	said.	"But	I	always	thought	the	old	coot	acted pretty	odd." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Huh.	I	had	the	damndest	conversation	with	him	before	I	drove	over	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p523"></a>That	night,	Ma	made	hamburgers	for	dinner.	Little	Bit	and	Digger	might have	been	playing	with	the	squeeze	bottle	of	ketchup,	or	maybe	I	made	a face	at	the	amount	of	ketchup	they	used,	or	maybe	some	ketchup	got	onto my	burger	and	I	asked	for	another	one.	What	I	remember	is	that	Pa	said	I should	get	over	being	finicky,	and	I	said	nothing.	He	said	I	should	try a	little,	and	I'd	find	it	wasn't	so	bad.	I	stayed	quiet.	He	said	I should	just	take	a	taste,	and	he	took	a	spoon,	squirted	a	drop	into	its bowl,	and	said,	"Here.	Eat	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Luke,	he	doesn't	have	to." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"It's	just	a	bite.	It's	time	he	learned	to	eat	what	the	rest	of us	eat.	Isn't	good	manners	eating	what's	set	before	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	told	me,	"Chris,	you	know	a	taste	won't	kill	you.	Pretend	it's	medicine." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Christ!"	Pa	said.	"You	always	turn	everything	into	a	big	damn	deal, Susan.	If	you	wouldn't	coddle	him--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	not,"	Ma	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eat	the	goddamn	ketchup,"	Pa	told	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ketchup	is	lumpy	and	slimy	and	the	color	of	blood.	Its	smell	made	the back	of	my	throat	lurch,	and	only	by	swallowing	could	I	keep	from	vomiting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just	eat	the	damn	ketchup,"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	sat	still.	Digger	and	Little	Bit	waited.	No	one	had	been	dismissed, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p524"></a>and	we	all	had	hamburgers	and	potato	chips	on	our	plates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well?"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head.	Ketchup	spat	from	the	squeeze	bottle	in	Pa's	fist, hitting	me	in	the	face.	"See?"	he	said.	"It's	goddamn	ketchup.	It's	no goddamn	big	deal.	Why's	everyone	make	such	a	goddamn	big	deal	out	of nothing?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p525"></a>The	next	day,	a	Saturday,	I	ran	out	to	meet	the	mailman	(who	was	a woman)	when	I	saw	her	station	wagon	pull	up	beside	our	mailbox.	She squinted	in	the	sunlight	and	said,	"Hey,	Chris,	how	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fine,	ma'am.	Any	mail	for	me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shook	her	head	sadly.	"No	packages	from	Minnesota,	no	Ranger	Rick's, no	nothing	for	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Except	this."	She	handed	me	an	envelope	that	I	recognized.	I	had	spent an	entire	dollar	to	subscribe	to	Aquaman	for	ten	issues,	which	would save	me	two	cents	for	each	copy,	but	more	importantly,	would	mean	that	I would	not	have	to	worry	that	the	grocery	store	would	miss	an	issue	one week.	I	thought	the	person	who	drew	Aquaman	was	the	best	artist	in	the world,	and	I	liked	the	story	of	the	blond	man	who	lived	under	the	sea where	he	rode	giant	sea	horses	and	visited	the	sunken	city	of	Atlantis and	fell	in	love	with	Mera,	the	red-haired	queen	of	an	underwater civilization	who	had	the	power	to	shape	and	control	water,	just	like	the Human	Torch	could	manipulate	flame	or	Green	Lantern	could	make	objects out	of	the	green	ray	from	his	ring.	The	only	thing	I	did	not	like	about Aquaman	was	his	kid	pal,	Aquaboy,	who	wore	tight	little	shorts	and	was every	bit	the	nuisance	for	Aquaman	that	Robin	was	for	Batman	or	Speedy</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p526"></a>was	for	Green	Arrow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	your	Ma's	got	a	letter	from	old	man	Shale.	This	must	be	the shortest	delivery	I	ever	made.	He	ain't	moved?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	think	so,	ma'am." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Maybe	he's	not	feeling	well.	I	don't	think	I	ever	seen	him	closed	on	a Saturday	before." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	mailman	waved,	called,	"See	you	later,	alligator."	She	pulled	onto the	highway	as	I	called,	"In	awhile,	crocodile!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	ran	to	the	restaurant	with	letters	and	bills	and	magazines	clutched	to my	chest	and	dumped	them	all	on	a	table	where	Pa	was	reading	a	book.	He began	to	flick	through	envelopes	and	magazines.	When	he	came	to	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shale's	thick	letter,	he	frowned	and	studied	the	address,	printed faintly	in	pencil	with	tiny,	neat,	block	letters.	"That's	for	Ma,"	I said.	"I'll	take	it	to	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	I	ran	out	as	Lurleen	said,	"Bye,	Hurr'cane."	Ma	was	in	the front	yard,	near	Digger	and	Little	Bit,	while	that	Saturday's	cleaning woman	shook	rugs	by	the	front	porch	of	our	house.	I	said,	"Here	comes the	mailman!"	Ma	laughed	as	she	set	aside	her	Ladies'	Home	Journal,	then frowned	like	Pa	when	she	read	the	envelope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Did	Rev'rend	Shale	move	away?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p527"></a>"No,"	Ma	said.	"I	don't	think	so,	anyway."	She	inserted	a	red	fingernail into	the	top	of	the	envelope	and	sliced	across	it,	then	withdrew	a	tight bundle	of	three-hole	notebook	paper	with	the	narrow	blue	lines	like	big kids	used.	She	smiled,	but	then	her	frown	returned	and	settled	on	her eyes	and	mouth.	I	started	to	look	at	the	pages,	but	Ma	said,	"No, Chris,"	in	a	quiet	voice,	and	then	she	flipped	to	the	end	and	said,	"Oh, my	God,"	and	stood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	is	it?	Huh,	Ma?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where's	your	father?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Up	front." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bertha,"	Ma	asked	the	cleaning	woman,	"Watch	the	children,	please." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes'm,"	said	the	woman	without	looking	away	from	the	rugs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	show	you	where,"	I	said	quickly,	and	started	to	lead	her	toward the	restaurant	before	she	could	tell	me	to	stay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	restaurant,	Ma	hurried	toward	Pa,	calling,	"Luke!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	up	from	his	book.	"What's	wrong?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	know.	Someone	should	check	on	Mr.	Shale." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	that	my	job?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	go.	I	just--"	She	handed	him	the	letter	and	pointed	to	a	paragraph near	the	end.	"I'm	worried." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're	always	worried.	I'd	only	worry	if	you	weren't	worried."	Then	he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p528"></a>was	quiet	while	he	read,	and	then	he	said,	"Call	the	sheriff." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Someone	should	go.	A	minute	could	make	a	difference."	Ma	turned	toward the	door.	"I'll	wait	for	the	sheriff	there." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No.	I'll	go." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	I'll	come	along." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No	need	to	make	a	big	deal	of	it."	He	stood,	then	looked	at	me.	"Chris can	come.	If	everything's	fine,	he	can	have	a	milk	shake." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	hesitated,	then	said,	"Choc'late?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sure." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	watched	us	with	the	expression	that	could	mean	almost	anything,	and then	said,	"Chris,	stay	in	the	car	until	your	father	makes	sure	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shale's	all	right,	okay?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	and	followed	Pa	out,	then	ran	to	circle	the	car	and	sit	in	the front	seat.	As	Pa	backed	away,	I	waved	at	Ma,	and	smiled	when	she	waved back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	and	I	drove,	as	usual,	in	silence.	Mr.	Shale's	letter	to	Ma	lay	on the	seat	between	us.	I	wondered	if	he	was	sick,	but	I	did	not	ask,	since I	would	find	out	soon	enough.	The	promise	of	a	milk	shake	made	me	think it	could	be	nothing	serious.	Some	years	later,	I	remembered	this	drive and	wondered	how	Pa	could	take	me	along,	and	how	Ma	could	let	him.	Only now	have	I	realized	that	I	was	there	to	reassure	everyone.	Letting	me	go</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p529"></a>and	Ma	stay	meant	Ma	and	Pa	both	thought	everything	would	be	fine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having	me	along	would	make	it	seem	that	Pa	and	I	had	stopped	in	for	a milk	shake,	rather	than	to	discover	whether	Gideon	Shale	had	taken	his shotgun	and	spattered	his	bedroom	wall	with	his	brains,	which	he	had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	did	not	see	his	body,	either	then	or	at	the	funeral.	Pa	went	into	the hamburger	shack	alone,	then	came	out	quickly	and	stood	by	the	driver's door	without	opening	it.	After	what	seemed	a	long	time,	I	said,	"Pa?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	got	to	wait	for	the	sheriff." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	is	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mr.	Shale's	dead,	Chris." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	I	was	sad	because	Pa	was	upset,	not	because	I	thought something	bad	had	happened.	Mr.	Shale	was	old.	Old	people	died.	Even	my grandparents	would	die	someday	in	that	unforeseeable	time	when	I	was	an adult,	and	so	would	Ma	and	Pa,	when	I	had	married	and	had	children,	and so	would	Little	Bit	and	Digger,	in	that	order,	after	me,	because	I	was oldest	and	the	price	of	being	oldest	was	dying	first,	which	did	not quite	seem	fair,	but	I	did	get	to	stay	up	half	an	hour	longer	than	they did,	which	might	be	a	fair	trade.	Pa	had	explained	this	years	ago, before	any	of	us	were	in	school,	I	think;	the	explanation	came	so	long ago	that	I	cannot	remember	hearing	it.	I	would	say	it	had	come	before words	were	part	of	my	memory,	but	I	remember	that	his	description	of	age</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p530"></a>and	death	had	upset	Ma	more	than	it	upset	Digger	or	Little	Bit	or	me.	We found	Pa's	acknowledgment	of	death	comforting.	Death	had	always surrounded	us,	from	swatted	flies	in	summertime	to	malformed	shapes	on the	sides	of	highways	to	nameless	Nazis	and	Indians	in	movies.	Death	had a	logic	that	we	understood,	and	Pa's	explanation	that	death	embraced everyone	was	pleasing.	It	confirmed	what	we	did	not	realize	we	already	knew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	Pa	said,	"He	killed	himself." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa's	tone	explained	suicide	to	me,	or	maybe	I	had	encountered	that	idea already,	and	had	never	thought	that	someone	I	knew	would	choose	to	die. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	might	kill	yourself,"	was	a	phrase	kids	often	heard.	It	was attached	to	some	things	you	shouldn't	do,	like	run	into	traffic	or	stand in	a	field	during	a	lightning	storm.	Only	crazy	or	sad	people	killed themselves.	In	stories,	suicide	happened	in	jail	cells	or	lunatic asylums	or	dark	houses	where	the	spirit	would	seek	revenge	on	those	who had	inspired	the	suicide.	Suicide	did	not	happen	in	back	rooms	of hamburger	shacks	near	your	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Was	he	sad?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Poor	crazy	bastard,"	Pa	said,	with	a	nod,	not	looking	at	me.	Then	he pointed	at	the	letter.	"You	want	to	read	it,	go	ahead."	I	watched	Pa walk	across	the	empty	parking	area,	where	he	sat	cross-legged	on	the grass	under	a	tree	near	the	edge	of	the	gravel.	I	picked	up	the	letter, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p531"></a>got	out	of	the	car,	went	to	sit	beside	Pa's	knee,	and	began	to	read. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p532"></a>Dear	Susan, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm	writing	you	because	my	kin	are	gone	and	you've	always	been	so	kind to	me.	If,	after	you've	asked	the	Good	Lord	to	bless	Luke,	Little	Bit, Digger,	Chris,	and	all	who	live	in	your	heart,	you	asked	Him	to	consider forgiving	me,	too,	I'd	be	grateful.	His	truth	has	always	been	dear	to me,	and	a	comfort	since	Estelle	and	Randy	were	taken.	I	have	long	been	a holy	fool	in	that	comfort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	is	my	Testament.	I	always	preached	that	you've	got	to	tell	it straight.	This	is	how	it	was,	as	best	as	I	can	recollect: I	was	alone	in	my	restaurant,	reading	Abraham's	story,	when	I	hear	a car.	As	I	look	up,	Artie	Drake's	LeSabre	turns	off	the	highway,	followed by	Nick	Lumiere's	white	convertible.	Like	any	Christian	businessman,	I was	pleased	to	have	both	business	and	company,	and	pleased	also	at	the notion	those	two	had	made	their	peace.	I	see	I'm	wrong	as	soon	as	they get	out	of	their	cars.	Nick	smiles	at	Artie,	but	Artie	ignores	him.	Once men	set	their	minds	on	being	asses,	it's	so	easy	for	them	to	continue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nick	comes	in	behind	Artie.	I	say	"Welcome!	You	seeking	food	for	body, mind,	or	soul?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	gets	a	smile	from	Artie.	He	says,	"All	three	would	be	grand." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nick	smiles,	too,	and	says,	"It's	good	to	know	you've	come	to	the	right</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p533"></a>place." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	say,	"I'm	pleased	to	hear	that.	What	can	I	get	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Artie	says,	"The	usual,	Gideon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nick	says,	"I'll	just	sit	a	spell,	if	you	don't	mind." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	say,	"You	got	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Artie	says,	"And	a	cup	of	java,	black.	And	a	chocolate	milk	shake.	If that	won't	clear	my	head,	nothing	will." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	my	vanity,	I	prepare	to	preach	as	I	slap	a	hamburger	patty	on	the grill.	I	say,	"World	gets	in	the	way	of	a	man's	clearest	thoughts." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Artie	smiles	and	says,	"Yeah.	But	should	you	walk	away	from	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pour	his	coffee,	saying,	"That's	not	so	easy	to	answer.	Look	at	Jesus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Did	he	walk	away	from	the	world,	or	toward	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nick	says,	"What	do	you	think?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	cannot	say	I	thought	yet.	My	hands	shook	from	rheumatism	as	I	worked the	scoop	through	the	hard	vanilla,	but	I'll	miss	that	hurt	when	I	give up	this	body	for	a	perfect	one.	Hands	like	doing	things,	even	when they're	hurting.	Maybe	especially	then.	Maybe	my	hands	were	saying things	more	true	than	anything	coming	out	of	my	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	my	mouth	said	was,	"A	little	of	both.	Jesus	was	born	a	man,	lived	a man,	and	died	a	man	so	we'd	all	know	we	can	live	well.	He	gave	up everything	to	walk	this	Earth,	teaching	sinners	and	healing	the	sick.	So</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p534"></a>he	gave	up	the	material	things	of	the	world,	but	he	didn't	give	up	the world	itself,	you	see?	Sometimes	he	went	off	by	himself	to	pray	and think,	but	he	always	came	back	to	be	with	people.	Even	after	death." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Artie	nods	as	I	turn	on	the	milkshake	mixer.	It	makes	an	ugly	rackety sound,	but	everyone	smiles	when	it	starts	up.	I	flip	Artie's	burger	up high--there's	a	showman	in	every	preacher,	even	in	Jesus.	As	the	burger lands,	I	turn	off	the	mixer,	pour	half	the	shake	in	a	tall	glass,	and set	the	glass	and	canister	in	front	of	Artie.	I	say,	"If	you're	troubled over	the	present,	I	find	it	a	blessing	to	think	on	the	future." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Artie	says,	"It's	thinking	on	the	future	that's	got	me	troubled." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ain't	but	one	way	to	know	the	future."	I	nod	at	the	Good	Book	as	I	slip his	hamburger	patty	on	a	bun	and	add	onion	the	way	he	likes	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's	it	tell	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Everything.	The	beginning	and	the	end,	and	what	to	do	in	between. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There's	peace	in	those	pages	if	you're	not	too	proud	to	ask	for	it	with all	your	heart." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nick	says,	"Tell	us	about	the	end." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	say,	"You	want	to	hear	about	the	end?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Artie,	beginning	to	eat,	says,	"Sure.	It's	nice	to	think	someone'll	pull our	fat	out	of	this	fire	we've	fixed." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	say,	"That's	not	God's	plan.	Well,	He'll	take	the	truly	saved	up	in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p535"></a>the	Rapture.	But	many'll	suffer	through	the	end	times,	through	the horrors	of	the	Great	Tribulation.	If	you	don't	make	good	with	God	before the	final	trumpet	sounds,	you're	damned	forever." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Artie	says,	"God	wins." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	Book	says	so." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	the	folks	in	Hell	get	out?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They've	earned	their	place.	God	denies	those	who	deny	Him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So,	even	after	the	Devil's	been	conquered,	Hell	keeps	a-going?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Artie	says,	"God's	hard." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	say,	"You're	a	parent.	You	know	love's	hard.	God	gives	you	a	choice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	got	to	live	with	it	forever." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	choice	with	a	deadline.	That's	not	an	ultimatum?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"When	you	can't	escape	your	own	decisions,	you're	an	adult.	God	gives	us each	a	final	exam.	It's	our	own	fault	if	we	flunk." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"When's	this	supposed	to	happen?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No	one	knows	the	day	or	hour.	That's	gospel.	Any	one	who	tells	you	a date	is	denying	the	Holy	Word." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	preachers	keep	saying	soon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sit	back	on	my	stool	and	say,	"The	prophets	tell	us	of	signs	so	we'll know	the	time	is	near.	And	it's	mighty	near.	It's	all	around.	That</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p536"></a>earthquake	in	Iran?	Twelve	thousand	dead.	Another	ten	thousand	hurt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over	twentyfive	thousand	homeless.	That's	a	sign.	Atomic	bombs	and hydrogen	bombs	here	and	in	Russia.	That's	a	sign.	We	have	the	power	to destroy	the	world	several	times	over,	but	the	end	times	only	call	for once.	There's	that	satellite,	Telstar.	Revelations	says	the	word'll	be spread	all	around	the	world	at	once.	I	don't	claim	to	know	it	all.	But	I know	enough	to	see	it	coming." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nick	says,	"Ask	him	how	many	nations	are	in	the	Southeast	Asia	Treaty Organization." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	say,	"How	many	nations	in	SEATO?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Artie	sets	his	burger	down.	"Mmm?	Britain,	Australia,	France,	the Philippines,	New	Zealand,	Thailand,	Pakistan.	And	us,	of	course.	Eight." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nick	says,	"How	many	kingdoms	does	that	make?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Artie	says,	"What	is	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	say,	"Great	Britain.	That's	the	thrones	of	England,	Scotland,	and Wales.	That's	ten	countries	in	SEATO." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Artie	says,	"So?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	say,	"A	confederacy	of	ten	nations.	Daniel	7:7.	The	beast	with	ten horns.	Out	of	the	confederacy	comes	the	Antichrist." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Artie	smiles.	"Wasn't	that	Hitler?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p537"></a>"All	right.	Who,	then?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	used	to	think	the	Pope.	God	says	you'll	know	the	beast	by	his	number, 1.	 The	Pope's	called	the	Vicar	of	Christ.	The	numerical	value	of	that in	Latin	is	666.	But	it's	not	given	to	me	to	know	who	the	Antichrist	is, only	that	he's	coming.	Daniel	7:25.	'He	shall	speak	great	words	against the	Most	High,	and	shall	wear	out	the	saints	of	the	Most	High,	and	think to	change	times	and	laws.'	The	Good	Book	calls	him	the	king	of	Babylon, the	little	horn,	the	man	of	sin,	the	son	of	perdition,	the	beast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There's	a	horde	of	clues,	if	only	men	were	wise	enough	to	see	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's	why	we	keep	watching." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Artie	says,	"All	right.	Where	do	you	watch?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	look	at	Nick	and	say,	"He'll	make	a	pact	with	Israel.	He'll	enter	the rebuilt	Temple	of	Jerusalem.	And	there's	his	number,	666.	Maybe	he'll give	everyone	a	number	to	keep	track	of	them,	tattoo	it	on	their foreheads.	Maybe	it'll	be	like	a	social	security	number.	He'll	claim	to be	the	Messiah,	or	a	savior,	anyway.	That	he	won't	regard	the	religion of	his	fathers	might	mean	he'll	be	a	Jew,	or	maybe	a	Christian,	but he'll	claim	to	bring	a	special	teaching	about	Christ's	teaching,	like the	Catholics	and	the	Mormons.	Or	maybe	he'll	just	ignore	the	religion he	was	brought	up	in	and	create	one	of	his	own.	But	he'll	be	destroyed in	the	great	war	when	he	fights	the	kings	of	the	north	and	south.	If	he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p538"></a>sets	himself	up	in	Jerusalem,	which	is	most	likely,	the	kingdom	of	the north	would	be	the	Russians	and	the	kingdom	of	the	south	would	be	the Arabs,	or	maybe	the	Red	Chinese,	unless	they're	the	kingdom	of	the	east." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where's	the	U.S.	fit	in	this?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	entire	world	will	be	Satan's	battleground." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	this	comforts	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Knowing	I'll	be	saved	comforts	me.	Knowing	I'll	be	reunited	with	my loved	ones	comforts	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	said	Eden	was	here	in	Florida." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Artie	says,	"Then	Florida's	the	Israel	of	the	prophecies." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Maybe.	The	Israel	before	the	Flood,	anyway.	But	the	Temple	was	built	in the	Israel	that	Noah	founded	when	the	Ark	came	to	rest." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	Armageddon	might	start	right	here	in	Latchahie	County?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	shouldn't	joke	about	some	things,	Artie." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Artie	shrugs	and	grins.	"The	pieces	seem	to	fit." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pieces	seem	to	fit	in	many	ways.	God	has	a	perfect	plan,	but	imperfect man	has	trouble	seeing	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Here's	a	question	for	you,	then.	Who's	the	friend	of	Israel?	The post-Flood	Israel?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why,	the	U.S.	of	A,	what	with	the	Arabs	and	the	Russians	against	them." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p539"></a>Artie	nods.	"Now,	if	you're	talking	about	a	pre-Flood	Israel	right	here, wouldn't	Castro	down	in	Cuba	fit	your	Anti-Christ	bill?	Preaching Communism	and	talking	to	the	United	Nations	where	the	representatives	of the	world	can	hear	him	all	at	once?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sure.	Could	be." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Or	you	could	argue	the	U.S.	is	the	New	Babylon.	That'd	fit	with	the Anti-Christ	befriending	Israel,	which	Castro	hasn't	done.	If	Eden's	here in	Florida,	our	military	build-up	along	the	coast	would	be	a	build-up	in God's	land,	wouldn't	it?	Would	that	make	J.F.K.	the	Anti-Christ?	He's	a Catholic,	and	he	doesn't	pay	his	church	much	mind." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This	is	a	great	Christian	nation,	Artie.	We	came	here	to	escape	the tyranny	of	Catholics	and	Anglicans." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nick	says,	"Really?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Artie	says,	"A	religious	background	doesn't	make	us	a	religious	nation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	disrespect,	but	Washington	said,	ah,	'The	government	of	the	United States	is	not,	in	any	sense,	founded	on	the	Christian	religion,'	and Jefferson	said,	'Christianity	neither	is,	nor	ever	was	a	part	of	the common	law.'	You'd	think	they'd	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	say,	"This	is	a	Christian	nation,	Artie.	Look	at	the	Declaration	of Independence	and	the	Constitution." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	never	mention	Jesus." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p540"></a>"Right	on	our	money,	it	says,'In	God	We	Trust.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Which	god?	Take	a	gander	at	the	dollar	bill.	You	see	the	eye	in	the pyramid?	That's	no	Christian	symbol	I	ever	saw.	Looks	more	like	the symbol	of	Mammon,	whose	temples	are	on	Wall	Street.	Are	you	all	right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	steadied	myself	against	the	counter.	"Sure." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Artie	says,	"I	don't	mean	this	country's	un-Christian.	It's non-Christian.	We	give	lip-service	to	Christianity,	but	that	doesn't mean	a	thing.	On	our	biggest	holidays,	who	gets	more	attention,	the	baby and	the	dying	Jesus,	or	Santa	Claus	and	the	Easter	Bunny?	If	we	were	a Christian	nation,	wouldn't	we	follow	Jesus's	advice?	I	don't	see	us selling	all	our	goods	and	giving	the	money	to	the	poor.	I	don't	see	us turning	the	other	cheek	when	another	country	threatens	our	interests. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jesus	said	'Woe	to	the	rich.'	Aren't	we	the	richest	nation	in	the	world? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Isn't	Jesus	crying	woe	to	America?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This	is	God's	land,	Artie.	The	nations	of	the	world	must	choose	between Him	and	Satan.	We're	the	example	to	help	them	choose.	He's	made	us	the richest	people	in	the	world	because	we're	doing	His	work.	Just	look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	Germany	to--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nick	says,	"Guatemala.	The	U.S.	intervened	there	in	1954." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	say,	"Guatemala.	We	keep	the	world	safe." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Artie	says,	"Sure.	Take	Guatemala.	Would	a	Christian	nation	do	that? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p541"></a>Arbenz	was	democratically	elected.	Aren't	we	supposed	to	support democracies,	not	overthrow	them?	And	Eisenhower	authorized	it.	Can	you imagine	George	Washington	approving	dirty	tricks	in	foreign	lands? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doesn't	anyone	remember	the	Monroe	doctrine?	Don't	other	countries	have a	right	to	self-determination,	same	as	us?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	say,	"You	got	to	fight	Satan	wherever	he	shows	himself." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nick	says,	"Like	America	in	Iran	in	1953." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	say,	"Like	in	Iran." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Artie	says,	"Exactly.	Who	knows	what	Iran	would've	done,	if	we	hadn't put	the	shah	back	in	power.	Maybe	they	would've	had	elections.	They	were talking	like	they	would.	God	knows	the	shah	never	will.	If	America's	a Christian	democracy,	why're	we	supporting	an	Islamic	monarch?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	say,	"That's	other	countries.	But	here	in	America--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nick	says,	"In	the	fifties,	the	U.S.	dusted	several	of	its	cities	with radioactive	powder	to	study	the	threat	of	atomic	war,	and	never	told	the inhabitants.	Americans	were	injected	with	plutonium	and	uranium	without being	told	what	they	were	receiving." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Artie	says,	"What?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shake	my	head.	"Americans	weren't	ever	sprayed	with	radiation	in secret	tests?	Or	given	shots	of	God	knows	what,	and	never	told	the	truth?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nick	says,	"At	Tuskegee,	American	doctors	withheld	treatment	from</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p542"></a>syphilitic	Negroes	to	study	the	effect	of	the	unchecked	disease." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	say,	"Coloreds	with	the	clap	weren't	treated	by	doctors	they	trusted? </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	can't	be.	The	government	wouldn't	be	so	low	as	to	lie	to	someone with	as	little	as	a	Negro." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Artie	frowns.	"Where'd	you	hear	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	you	know?"	I	insist,	wanting	Nick	to	be	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	I	did?"	Artie	finally	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	you	got	to	speak	it.	The	truth	is	a	shield." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've	got	pieces	of	rumors,	Gideon.	I	don't	have	the	big	picture.	I'm not	supposed--"	Artie	pushed	his	plate	away	from	him.	"All	right.	Those rumors,	I've	heard	them,	too.	I	don't	know	how	far	it	goes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nick	says,	"Political	assassination." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	say,	"Assassination?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Artie	says,	"Did	Dmitri	stop	by?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Forget	it.	I	can't	confirm	anything	that	someone	else	can't	deny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suppose	I	thought	I	knew	some	secrets.	Would	they	be	real	secrets?	Real is	what	you	verify,	and	you	can	verify	anything	you	want	when	you	can fake	the	files	and	the	photos.	What's	the	use	of	knowing	secrets	anyway? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wouldn't	it	be	best	just	to	watch	TV	and	believe	everything	you're	told? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wouldn't	knowing	secrets	and	not	being	able	to	do	anything	about	them	be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p543"></a>one	way	of	living	in	Hell?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This	is	America,	Artie.	If	there	are	secrets,	they're	for	our	own	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's	not	like	living	under	communism.	The	Russians	lie	to	their	people because	they're	godless.	Their	space	program's	a	hoax.	The	Chinese	lie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Satan	is	in	their	hearts,	and	they	reject	God's	word." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's	it	mean	if	our	government	lies	to	us?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pray	with	me,	Artie.	God	has	the	answers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	can't	anymore,	Gideon.	Sorry." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	got	to	trust	God." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Like	it	says	on	the	dollar?	I	feel	like	I'm	walled	up	inside	that	stone pyramid,	Gideon.	Along	with	99.99%	of	the	country.	Or	the	world.	I	don't know	who's	up	there	at	the	eye	able	to	see	what's	really	going	on,	but it	sure	isn't	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	grip	his	shoulder.	"Stay	with	God,	Artie.	With	the	end	near--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nick	says,	"11:59	am,	October	29,	1962." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Artie	says,	"Gideon?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nick	says,	"That's	local	time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	say,	"What?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Artie	says,	"Look,	don't	give	any	thought	to	what	I've	been	saying, hear?	I	jump	to	conclusions	as	fast	as	anyone.	Maybe	faster." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	say,	"Sure." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p544"></a>My	hand	falls	from	Artie's	shoulder,	but	he	puts	his	on	mine.	"You've got	an	answer	that	works	for	you,	Gideon.	Hang	onto	it.	And	I'll	think on	what	you've	said,	too.	I	expect	you're	right.	God's	got	a	plan.	It's nice	to	know	it's	all	going	to	work	out." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	look	at	Nick.	He	whispers,	"Boom." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Artie	says,	"People	like	hearing	you	preach,	you	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	say,	"That's	good." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	ought	to	get	out	more.	Go	visit	some	family	or	friends." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They're	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well."	Artie	nods.	"I	should	to	be	going.	But	I'll	be	back	next	week for	another	talk	and	a	meal." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	coming,	Artie.	Sooner	than	I	ever	thought.	Call	on	Jesus.	Call	on Him	tonight,	if	you	won't	do	it	now.	Don't	wait	another	day,	hear?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sure,	Gideon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	reaches	for	his	wallet,	I	tell	him	not	to	pay	me.	He	leaves	a dollar	anyway	and	says	to	put	the	change	to	some	good	work.	It's	still lying	on	the	counter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Artie	drives	off,	Nick	says,	"He's	right,	you	know.	New	York	is	New Babylon.	All	the	leaders	of	all	the	nations	of	the	world	send	their servants	to	Babylon	to	worship,	and	pledge	their	service,	and	pay tribute,	and	receive	gifts.	You	know	why	that	is." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p545"></a>I	say,	"Who's	the	beast?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	think	the	beast	is	in	the	newspapers	and	on	TV?	All	you	know	are the	names	of	the	puppets." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're	lying." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What're	lies	from	a	liar	worth?.	It's	truth	that	no	one	can	stand against.	It's	not	a	shield.	It's	a	sword." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Get	out." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	think	you	had	it	figured	wrong." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	got	it	figured	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	outline,	yes.	The	Rapture,	the	Tribulation,	the	End.	But	if everything's	certain,	why's	Jesus	desperately	hustling	troops?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"To	save	as	many	of	us	as	He	can." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"To	save	Himself.	He	knows	He's	lost." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	you	know	so	much,	when's	the	Rapture?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Midnight,	March	12."	Nick	smiles.	"1959." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why'd	you	ever	think	He'd	want	you?	You	get	drunk	and	drive	your	wife and	boy	into	a	tree,	then	you	trot	around	preaching	like	God's	never spoken	to	anyone	but	you.	But	you	know	what	Jesus	thinks	of	hypocrites." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nick	says,	"There	are	folks	who	recognize	weakness,	and	forgive	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p546"></a>I	say,	"Get." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where're	Estelle	and	Randy,	Gideon?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Get!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	he	leaves.	I	watch	him	go,	like	Artie,	toward	Dogland. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	know	him	for	a	liar	in	what's	important.	And	I	know	how	to	prove	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	I	have	been	a	fool	on	this	earth,	it	won't	matter.	If	I've	done	some good	during	my	days,	God	will	forgive	me.	If	the	Rapture	truly	has	come and	His	hand	passed	over	me,	I	don't	mind.	I	can	catch	up	to	Him.	Not even	the	truth	can	drive	me	away	from	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	the	final	victory	is	really	not	certain,	maybe	that's	what's important.	Maybe	we're	none	of	us	perfect	because	He	made	us	as	best	He could,	which	wasn't	good	enough.	Maybe	He'd	like	us	to	show	up	and	tell Him	it's	all	right.	We're	grateful	for	what	He	did.	And	we	forgive	Him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yours	with	God, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gideon	Shale</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p547"></a>Pa	said,	"You	may	not	want	to	tell	your	Ma	I	let	you	read	that.	It	was addressed	to	her,	and,	well,	she	believes	you	protect	kids	by	keeping some	things	from	them	for	as	long	as	you	can." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Things	about	Mr.	Shale?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"Like	that.	You	can	be	crazy	and	a	good	person,	just	like	you can	be	sane	and	a	son-of-a-bitch." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Okay." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	and	I	drove	home	when	Rooster	Donati	arrived.	The	news	about	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shale	reached	Dogland	before	we	did.	Mr.	Drake	was	there,	standing beside	Ma,	who	had	tears	in	her	eyes.	Little	Bit	might	have	been	sad, but	Digger	did	not	seem	to	know	anything	had	changed.	Ma	said	he	was	too young	to	understand,	and	we	shouldn't	tell	him	that	Mr.	Shale	had	died unless	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	funeral	was	a	few	days	later.	Pa	asked	me	if	I	wanted	to	go,	and said	I	did	not	have	to,	then	seemed	disappointed	when	I	decided	to	stay home.	A	funeral	was	like	church,	but	more	solemn.	Wasn't	it	better	to stay	home	and	play? </p>

<h3 class="sigilnotintoc">Not	Long	Before	the	End</h3>

<p class="calibre1">Second-graders	are	superior	to	first-graders,	which	sometimes	meant	we</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p548"></a>were	kind	to	them,	and	occasionally	meant	we	were	cruel,	but	generally meant	we	ignored	them	because	they	were	such	small,	timid,	and	ignorant creatures.	Dorrie	Doo-doo	had	failed	to	pass,	so	she	was	repeating	first grade,	and	Wayne	Lawson	had	squeezed	by	with	a	report	card	full	of	D's, so	he	was	in	third	grade.	Though	the	Lawsons	rode	my	bus,	I	did	not	have to	share	a	class	with	either	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	second	grade,	I	took	a	band	class	twice	a	week,	which	meant	three things.	I	was	excused	for	an	hour	of	the	day	with	the	other	band students,	I	got	to	see	Ronnie,	who	sat	with	me	on	the	bus	but	was	in	the other	second	grade	class	for	the	rest	of	the	day,	and	I	got	to	sit	near Jeannie	Peterson,	a	small,	quiet	girl	with	light	brown	hair	just	like Stephen	Foster's	"Jeannie	with	the	Light	Brown	Hair,"	and	for	that	year, she	was	the	girl	I	imagined	I	would	marry	when	I	grew	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	began	first	grade,	so	for	a	week	or	two,	I	had	to	sit	with her	on	the	bus.	Though	it	was	a	duty,	it	gave	me	pride	to	be	her guardian.	Once	she	made	friends	of	her	own,	we	tended	to	sit	apart.	That did	not	mean	we	thought	less	of	each	other.	We	had	always	understood that	we	could	count	on	each	other	for	anything	that	was	important,	and nothing	that	was	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	second	grade	teacher	was	Mrs.	Robbins,	a	small,	white-haired	woman who	smiled	more	often	than	Mrs.	Howe.	I	remember	that	I	liked	her,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p549"></a>the	teacher	who	had	the	greatest	effect	on	me	that	year	was	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pickett,	who	taught	fifth	grade.	The	elementary-grade	teachers	shared playground	duty,	and	all	the	kids	knew	that	Mrs.	Pickett	was	the quickest	to	send	students	to	the	principal	for	a	paddling.	Mr.	Hadley was	a	pleasant	man	who	smiled	and	nodded	at	everyone,	but	in	his	office, he	had	two	paddles,	a	round	one	that	stung	and	a	long	one	with	holes drilled	in	it	that	whistled	through	the	air	to	really	hurt.	Wayne	Lawson was	the	only	kid	I	knew	who	had	been	paddled	by	Mr.	Hadley.	He	was	our source	of	knowledge	about	Mr.	Hadley's	paddles,	which	would	make	anyone cry,	except	Wayne	Lawson. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p550"></a>In	the	world	beyond	Latchahie	County,	September	began	with	the earthquake	in	Iran	that	Mr.	Shale	had	thought	was	a	sign.	On	the	tenth, the	U.S.	Supreme	Court	decided	that	the	University	of	Mississippi	should obey	a	federal	order	to	enroll	its	first	Negro	student,	James	Meredith, a	veteran	of	the	U.S.	Air	Force.	Three	days	later,	President	Kennedy said	the	national	government	would	protect	voter	registration	workers who	had	been	helping	to	register	Southern	blacks	in	the	face	of	legal harrassment,	arson,	beatings,	shootings,	and	bombings.	On	the seventeenth,	Attorney	General	Robert	Kennedy	filed	a	suit	to	end segregation	in	U.S.	military	schools	in	Richmond,	Virginia.	He	said,	"It makes	no	sense	that	we	should	ask	military	personnel	to	make	sacrifices and	serve	away	from	home	and	at	the	same	time	see	their	children	treated as	inferiors	by	local	requirements	that	they	attend	segregated	schools." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meredith	tried	to	register	at	the	University	of	Mississippi	four	times in	September.	Twice,	the	governor	stopped	him	in	person.	President Kennedy	sent	U.S.	deputy	marshals	to	force	the	university	to	admit Meredith.	A	riot	began.	Thirty-five	marshals	were	shot.	One	of	the	two men	killed	was	a	French	journalist	who	had	come	to	observe	the	working of	freedom,	equality,	and	brotherhood	in	America.	After	the	governor	of Mississippi	was	threatened	with	fines	and	a	jail	sentence,	Meredith</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p551"></a>registered	on	October	1	and	began	attending	classes	accompanied	by federal	guards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	end	of	September,	the	U.S.	decided	to	sell	missiles	to	Israel	to help	arm	it	against	Arab	neighbors	who	bought	their	weapons	from	the U.S.S.R.	The	U.S.	announced	it	would	use	"whatever	means	may	be necessary,	including	the	use	of	arms"	to	stop	Cuba	from	promoting</p>
<p class="calibre1">"subversive	activities	to	any	part	of	this	hemisphere,"	and	Defense Secretary	McNamara	declared	the	U.S.	would	use	nuclear	weapons	to	defend West	Berlin	from	the	U.S.S.R. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	me,	September	and	early	October	meant	a	new	television	season.	I	had the	week's	schedule	memorized	for	the	hours	that	I	was	home	and	awake, and	I	was	always	amazed	when	anyone	older	than	me	didn't	know	the	day and	time	that	anything	aired.	"The	Jetsons"	was	silly,	but	it	was	the future,	so	I	watched	a	cartoon	family	in	a	time	where	everything	was pristine	and	gleaming,	and	people	had	difficulties,	but	never	had problems.	"The	Beverly	Hillbillies"	was	also	silly,	but	I	liked	Jed's wise	patience,	and	I	wanted	to	grow	big	and	handsome	like	Jethro,	and Ellie	was	pretty	and	wore	tight	clothes,	which	meant	something	that	had a	name	I	did	not	yet	know.	Ma	liked	"the	Lucy	Show,"	and	the	character that	Lucille	Ball	played	was	a	caricature	of	Ma,	pretty	but	not	vain, often	flustered	yet	always	tenacious.	Pa	liked	cowboy,	lawyer,	and	army</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p552"></a>shows.	"The	Virginian"	had	too	little	shooting	for	my	taste,	"The Defenders"	had	too	much	talking,	but	"Combat"	suited	both	of	us.	We could	sit	together	in	peace	while	Americans	and	Nazis	fought	for	the freedom	of	the	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p553"></a>One	morning	before	school,	Pam,	Roxie,	and	I	played	Fireball	XL-5.	I	was the	brave	space	pilot,	Colonel	Steve	Zodiac;	Pam	was	his	blonde	girl friend,	Venus;	Roxie	took	turns	being	the	the	robot	and	the	elderly scientist;	and	Ronnie	was	the	funny	furry	space	alien	companion.	Pam's Venus	was	more	adventurous	than	the	show's,	and	Roxie	only	played because	the	rest	of	us	would	not	play	the	quieter	games	she	preferred, and	Ronnie's	parents	didn't	have	a	TV,	which	meant	I	would	have	to	make suggestions	about	his	interpretation	of	his	character,	which	he	would laugh	at	and	ignore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	had	just	blasted	off	from	Space	City	when	I	saw	Wayne	Lawson	running at	me.	Colonel	Steve	Zodiac	bolted	from	the	pilot's	seat	and	into	the depths	of	space	without	bothering	to	use	the	air	lock.	I	ran	across	the playground,	darting	in	one	direction,	then	another,	but	I	knew	I	wasn't faster,	and	I	was	probably	tiring	myself	more	than	Wayne	Lawson.	As	his arms	closed	to	grab	me,	I	ducked	down	and	tucked	my	head.	Wayne	Lawson tumbled	over	me.	When	I	stood,	he	was	still	on	the	ground.	He	got	up slowly,	shaking	himself,	and	I,	still	thinking	him	invincible,	looked around	for	a	playground	monitor,	hoping	someone	would	see	us	so	I	would not	have	to	commit	the	sin	of	calling	for	a	teacher. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	Lawson	said,	"You're	pretty	fast." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p554"></a>I	nodded,	seeing	something	had	changed	between	us,	and	wondering	if	I could	do	the	same	thing	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	teacher	on	playground	duty,	someone	I	did	not	know,	passed	by	and asked,	"You	boys	all	right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just	playing,"	Wayne	Lawson	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just	playing,"	I	repeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	don't	play	too	rough,"	she	said,	and	walked	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	crowd	of	kids,	mostly	second	and	third	graders,	had	formed	near	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	Lawson	said,	"I	hear	your	Pa's	a	ay-thee-ist." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	not,"	I	said,	because	whatever	it	was,	his	tone	told	me	it	was	bad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	was	in	the	paper." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pam	and	Roxie	looked	hard	at	me.	If	it	was	in	the	paper,	how	could	it fail	to	be	true?	Under	the	pressure	of	the	moment,	I	made	an intellectual	leap.	"So	what?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	it	was	in	the	paper,"	he	repeated,	but	he	knew	that	sounded	weak.	He looked	as	though	he	wished	I	had	not	managed	to	duck	and	was	wondering how	quickly	I	could	duck	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	ask	him,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	Lawson	nodded.	"All	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	got	home	that	afternoon,	I	went	straight	to	the	house,	dropped	my books	in	the	kids'	room,	and	hurried	out	back	by	the	dogs.	Ma	and	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p555"></a>Drake	were	by	the	far	grooming	shed,	laughing	at	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	had	parked	a	small	aluminum	house	trailer	inside	the	privacy fence	surrounding	our	home.	Though	the	trailer	was	probably	ten	or twenty	years	old,	it	seemed	like	the	future	to	me.	It	had	a	room	at	one end	that	was	large	enough	for	a	double	bed,	and	a	bathroom	just	big enough	for	a	toilet	and	a	shower,	and	a	main	room	that	was	divided between	the	kitchen	and	living	area	by	a	dining	booth	with	two	padded vinyl	benches,	just	like	in	restaurants.	It	had	a	sofa	that	opened	into a	guest	bed,	and	a	television,	and	everything	you	could	want	in	the world.	And	it	all	could	be	hitched	to	the	back	of	your	car	whenever	you pleased,	and	you	would	never	have	to	stay	anywhere	you	did	not	truly want	to	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since	Mr.	Drake	had	begun	living	at	Dogland,	he	wore	jeans	and	boots	and old	shirts.	His	hair	was	growing	longer,	curling	around	the	tops	of	his ears,	and	he	had	stopped	shaving.	One	day	he'd	been	cleaning	under	dog pens,	and	when	he	came	up	front	to	eat	lunch,	he	had	a	bit	of	dog	turd in	his	beard,	which	everyone	thought	was	funny,	especially	Ma,	who	would never	have	been	amused	if	something	like	that	had	happened	to	us.	Every time	Mr.	Drake	tried	to	explain	how	he	had	found	that	the	best	way	to clean	under	the	dog	houses	was	to	take	the	hose,	crouch	in	each	dog's porch,	and	lean	forward	till	he	was	hanging	upside	down,	we	would	all</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p556"></a>start	laughing,	and	so	would	he.	Whenever	I	saw	him	during	the	first weeks	he	was	at	Dogland,	he	was	smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Hi,	Ma,	hi,	Mr.	Drake,	what's	a	ay-thee-ist?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"I	think	I'll	make	a	round	of	the	pens." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"You	don't	have	to	go." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	said,	"Oh,	yes,	I	do.	Politics,	religion,	and	the	birds	and	the	bees are	strictly	between	kids	and	their	parents."	He	walked	away	whistling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Why	do	you	ask?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wayne	Lawson	said	Pa's	one." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	frowned.	I	wondered	if	she	would	tell	me,	and	then	she	said	simply, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"An	atheist	is	a	person	who	doesn't	believe	in	God." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	what	does	he	believe	in?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	something	you	should	ask	your	father." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Isn't	there	a	God?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes.	I	believe	there	is." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	Pa	doesn't?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	really	should	ask	him	yourself,	Chris." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Okay." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	found	Ethorne	and	Helen	preparing	the	dogs'	evening	meal.	"Hi,	Helen, hi,	Ethorne." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	said,	"Hey,	Chris." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p557"></a>Ethorne	said,	"How	do,	Mast'	Chris." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	watched	them	work	for	a	long	minute.	"Helen?	Are	you	a	naytheist?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	said	solemnly,	"I'm	a	Seventh-Day	Adventist,	Chris.	You	know	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes'm,	but	are	you	a	naytheist?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	looked	at	Ethorne.	"These	poor	children." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"He	just	asked,	is	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	smiled.	I	always	liked	people	with	confident	smiles,	the	sort	that said	they	knew	all	the	answers,	but	did	not	hold	that	against	anyone	who did	not.	She	said,	"No,	I	ain't	an	atheist.	Adventist	means	I	know	the Lord's	returnin'	soon,	and	then	there	won't	be	any	atheists	at	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"God?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	right.	You're	not	an	atheist	neither,	are	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged	and	looked	at	Ethorne.	"D'you	believe	in	God,	Ethorne?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	said,	"What	you	believe	don't	change	what	is." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	do	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	sometimes	I	do,	and	sometimes	I	don't."	He	grinned.	"Mostly	I	do, I	'xpect." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	said,	"How	long's	it	been	since	you	saw	the	inside	of	a	church, Ethorne?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	said,	"Ain't	the	skies	the	roof	of	God's	church?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	laughed.	"You	should'a'	been	a	preacher-man." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p558"></a>Ethorne	shook	his	head.	"No,	ma'm.	There's	times	I	think	I	got	all	the answers,	but	I	thank	the	lord	of	judgment	those	times	don't	last." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Is	it	bad	to	be	a	naytheist?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	said,	"It's	bad	for	the	atheist." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"I	wouldn't	say	bad	exactly.	Folks	got	a	right	to	believe what	they	want,	long	as	they	don't	hurt	no	one.	But	the	times	I'm	an atheist,	it's	mighty	lonely." </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	came	through	the	front	passway,	I	saw	four	tourists	walking toward	the	Doggy	Salon.	I	ran	across	the	grass	to	jump	over	the	little row	of	bushes	that	lined	the	main	path.	As	I	approached	them,	I	heard one	say,	"Listen.	The	ravens	are	gathering."	The	woman	nodded	after	the one-eyed	man	spoke,	but	none	of	them	looked	up	at	the	sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	up,	saw	no	birds,	and	said,	"Would	you	folks	like	a	guide?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	handsome	man	said,	"Why,	it's	Christopher	Nix.	You	must	remember	us?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	big	man	laughed	at	the	handsome	one.	"Children	forget	you,	and	women do,	too.	If	you	want	to	be	remembered,	you've	got	to	be	on	television." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	even	then,"	said	the	one-eyed	man.	"Who	values	the	past	in	the	land of	tomorrow?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	pretty	woman	said,	"You	remember	us.	We	stopped	in	a	couple	of	years ago.	You've	grown	since	then." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p559"></a>"Oh,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	had	to	return,"	said	the	handsome	man.	"For	a	last	look." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	one-eyed	man	told	him,	"You	needn't	be	so	amused." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	around.	Dogland	was	Dogland.	Funny	things	had	happened	here, but	I	did	not	think	they	wanted	to	hear	about	Mr.	Drake's	beard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	handsome	man	said,	"Am	I	amused?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	big	man	said,	"You're	always	amused." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	said,	"He's	never	amused.	That's	why	he's	never	quiet." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Me?"	said	the	handsome	man.	"Never	quiet?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,"	the	other	three	said	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,"	said	the	handsome	man.	"Observe	then."	He	winked	at	me.	"Not bad,	eh?	Care	to	hear	it	again?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,"	said	the	one-eyed	man.	"And	often." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	handsome	man	smiled.	"If	I	agreed	with	you,	I'd	never	let	a	secret slip.	Which	would	you	rather	have,	peace	or	wisdom?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come,"	said	the	pretty	woman.	"Show	us	the	dogs." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Okay,"	I	said,	walking	up	the	path.	"We	just	got	a	Rottweiler	and	a Rhodesian	Ridgeback.	The	Ridgeback	was	used	for	hunting	lions	in	Africa, and	the	Rottweiler's	a	working	dog	that	goes	way	back	to	Roman	times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's	got	a	funny	name." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Does,"	agreed	the	big	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p560"></a>The	woman	told	me,	"Something's	on	your	mind." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	"D'you	believe	in	God?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mmm,"	said	the	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	big	man	laughed,	and	the	handsome	man	said,	"Do	your	parents?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Ma	does.	I	guess	Pa	doesn't." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	you	should	half-believe." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	one-eyed	man	said,	"Be	careful	what	you	pay	to	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	showing	the	tourists	around	the	dog	pens,	I	found	Seth	in	the kitchen.	Pa	said	he	wasn't	as	good	a	cook	as	Ethorne,	but	at	least	you never	had	to	worry	about	him	disappearing	for	days	at	a	time.	I	opened the	back	door,	and	he	looked	back	from	the	griddle.	"Hey,	Chris.	Need	to know	something?"	He	had	told	me	about	the	Colossus	of	Rhodes	when	I	read about	Colossal	Boy	in	the	Legion	of	Super-Heroes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	I	said.	"Yes.	Are	you	a	naytheist?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	laughed.	"Sure.	You	have	to	convert	when	you	become	a	commie	pinko radical	to	earn	a	'godless'	pin.	Are	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged.	"D'you	know	where	Pa	is?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In	the	gift	shop.	Mrs.	Stark	stayed	home	sick." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	she	a	naytheist?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seth	laughed.	"Mrs.	Stark	hasn't	missed	church	in	fifty	years,	I	bet. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p561"></a>Though	lots	of	people	go	to	church	for	reasons	besides	God." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ma	likes	getting	dressed	up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	you	are." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	hate	getting	dressed	up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sounds	like	a	solid	reason	for	atheism	to	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	and	ran	from	the	restaurant	to	the	gift	shop.	Pa	sat	behind	the cash	register,	a	place	I	almost	never	saw	him,	waiting	on	some	customers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	looked	over,	he	smiled	and	said,	"Well,	Mark	Christopher?"	The smile	told	me	he	was	in	a	good	mood,	but	using	both	of	my	names	meant	he was	not	annoyed	with	me	for	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	naytheist	doesn't	believe	in	God." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"That's	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	there	a	God?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Some	say	there	isn't.	Some	say	there	is,	but	they	don't	agree	about	the details.	You	got	Christians,	Jews,	Muslims,	Hindus,	Buddhists,	and	just about	anything	else	you	can	think	of.	There's	groups	inside	each	of those	groups	arguing	among	themselves	about	who's	worshipping	right.	I think	when	you	get	down	to	it,	there's	not	two	people	in	the	world	with the	exact	same	idea	about	God." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	is	there	a	God?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well.	You	can't	know	what	you	can't	prove.	You	could	ask	me	if	there</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p562"></a>was	a	thousand-pound	catfish	in	the	Suwannee,	and	I	couldn't	say." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	do	you	believe	there	is?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shrugged.	"Catfish	get	pretty	big." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	God!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mmm.	Did	you	talk	to	your	mother	about	this?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	said	to	ask	you.	Everybody	believes	in	God,	except	Seth	and sometimes	Ethorne." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	laughed.	"Everybody?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mrs.	Howe	and	Mrs.	Robbins.	Everybody	at	church.	Ma,	Helen,	and	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stark,	says	Seth.	I	didn't	ask	Lurleen,	but	they	take	Jordy	to	the Baptist	church.	And	four	tourists,	I	think." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	think?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	not	sure	if	they	did	or	didn't." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded.	"That's	God-talk	for	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	God	for	women?	All	the	women	believe	in	God." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shook	his	head.	"No.	The	most	famous	atheist	in	America's	probably	a woman	named	Madelyn	O'Hare." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh."	I	stood	and	waited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your	Ma	and	I	had	a	deal.	You	kids	get	to	decide	for	yourself	about	God." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	what	about	you,	Pa?	Do	you	believe	in	God?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	studied	me,	then	said,	"No.	I	don't." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p563"></a>"Why	not?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	I've	seen	horrible	things	done	in	the	name	of	God,	and	I've	seen good	things	done	by	people	who	aren't	religious	at	all.	So	I	figure religion	doesn't	matter.	If	you	live	a	good	life	and	there's	a	God worthy	of	the	name,	you're	probably	covered." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mrs.	Robbins	says	if	you	don't	believe	in	Jesus,	you'll	go	to	hell." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	God's	that	petty,	I'll	be	glad	to	go.	I'd	rather	be	with	Einstein, Gandhi,	and	Thomas	Jefferson	than	with	a	bunch	of	TV	preachers.	Shoot, based	on	what	Jesus	said	about	hypocrites,	he'll	be	down	there	with	us." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	won't	be	in	heaven	with	us?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	laughed.	"If	God's	got	any	goodness	in	him	at	all,	he'll	let	you	come visit." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"God's	bad?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	God	was	bad,	he'd	make	things	a	lot	worse	than	they	are.	But	if	God was	really	all	wise	and	all	powerful	and	all	kind,	he'd	make	'em	a	sight better.	So	I	don't	think	there's	a	God	at	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	everybody	wrong?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Considering	all	the	different	things	people	have	believed,	that	looks like	the	only	way	to	bet.	But	that's	one	area	I	agree	with	most religious	leaders.	If	there's	a	God,	he	wants	you	to	believe	because	you believe,	not	because	everyone	you	know	does." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p564"></a>I	nodded.	"Okay." </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	my	way	back	to	the	house,	I	spotted	Little	Bit	on	the	swing	set	and called,	"Hey,	guess	what?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pa's	a	naytheist." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	knew	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"D'you	know	what	it	means?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shook	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	torn	between	a	smile	of	triumph	and	a	scowl	of	despair.	"Means	he doesn't	believe	in	God." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	eyes	widened,	then	narrowed,	and	then	she	said,	"I	knew	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	Pa	doesn't	believe,	does	that	mean	Digger	and	I	can't	believe?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	turned	her	head	and	lifted	her	shoulder	to	scratch	her	ear.	"No." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ma	believes.	Does	that	mean	you	got	to	believe?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed.	"No." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why	not?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Cause	I	b'lieve	anyway." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Cause	God	talks	to	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	was	building	a	four-lane	highway	like	the	one	being	constructed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p565"></a>in	front	of	Dogland.	I	called,	"Hey,	Digger.	Digger.	Hey!"	When	he looked	up,	I	said,	"Where'd	Mr.	Shale	go?"	He	looked	from	me	to	Little Bit,	then	back.	I	said,	"Is	he	in	heaven?"	Little	Bit	nodded,	then Digger	nodded,	too.	I	looked	at	her.	"What	about	Kato?"	Kato	was	a Japanese	spaniel	who	had	died.	"Is	Kato	in	heaven?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	nodded.	"Everybody's	in	heaven." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	about	hell?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Only	bad	people	who're	sorry	they	were	bad." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	about	bad	people	who	aren't?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They're	in	heaven.	But	they're	not	having	fun." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why	not?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Cause	they're	afraid	God'll	catch	them." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	not	what	Mrs.	Robbins	says." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shrugged.	"That's	what	God	says." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	back	up	to	the	gift	shop.	"Pa?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Little	Bit	talks	to	God." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	laughed	like	he	often	did	when	Little	Bit	did	something	I	would	have been	spanked	for.	"Some	people	call	their	conscience	God.	Some	people call	a	lot	of	things	God.	If	you	call	nature	God,	then	I'm	not	an	atheist." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Was	that	in	the	newspaper?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p566"></a>"That	I'm	an	atheist?	No,	I	just	said	the	Supreme	Court	says	it's against	the	law	to	teach	religion	in	school.	Some	people	think	only	an atheist's	interested	in	obeying	the	law." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	spent	the	rest	of	the	afternoon	considering	these	things.	I	found	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drake	to	get	his	answer,	but	all	he	would	say	was,	"I	want	to	believe there's	a	God.	Since	an	atheist	doesn't,	I	guess	that	makes	me	a	believer." </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	supper,	Little	Bit	talked	about	everything	she	liked	at	school.	When she	was	done,	Pa	said,	"Let's	see.	You	like	the	kids,	the	teachers,	the recess,	the	games,	the	lunch,	the	bus,	and	the	bus	driver.	So,	you	like everything	about	school	except	the	school	parts?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"Gwenny	was	just	like	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"I	like	it	all.	I	got	to	read	the	Bible	story	today." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"You	did?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	at	him	just	as	Mr.	Drake	said,	"Which	one?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Samson	and	the	foxes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Huh.	I	only	remember	Delilah	and	pulling	down	the	pillars." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This	was	before.	He	got	three	hundred	foxes	and	tied	stuff	to	their tails	and	lit	it	on	fire.	And	the	foxes	ran	through	the	Philistines' </p>
<p class="calibre1">corn	fields	and	burned	it	all	down.	And	then	Samson	took	the	jawbone	of an	ass--"	Realizing	that	they	might	have	thought	I	had	said	a	bad	word, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p567"></a>I	said,	"A	donkey.	And	he	slewed	whole	bunches	of	Philistines." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	yeah.	I	always	liked	it	when	he	whales	into	the	Philistines	with that	jawbone." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	and	Little	Bit	laughed,	and	so	did	I.	Pa	said,	"Huh.	What'd	the Philistines	do	to	Samson?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"They	had	conquered	the	Jews." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Okay.	And	what	did	the	foxes	do?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Luke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"That's	a	reasonable	question,	isn't	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"I	dunno." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Were	they	bothering	anybody?	Weren't	they	just	running	around in	the	woods?	Couldn't	a	good	and	all-powerful	being	find	a	better	way to	defeat	Philistines	than	by	burning	up	innocent	foxes?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Luke,	that's	not	the	point." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I'd	imagine	it	was	for	the	foxes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	shook	her	head,	and	Mr.	Drake	laughed,	and	then	we	kids	laughed,	and finally	Ma	laughed,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	night	I	had	the	oldest	dream	that	I	remember.	Pam	was	in	it,	and maybe	Roxie,	too,	or	maybe	they	turned	into	each	other	as	the	dream progressed.	There	was	a	white	horse	that	might	have	been	a	unicorn.	It was	night,	and	I	was	in	the	dream,	and	not	merely	watching	it.	I	think	I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p568"></a>was	naked,	but	that	did	not	embarrass	me	until	I	woke	up,	because	I	was also	dead,	like	a	zombie.	Pam	or	Roxie	was	leading	me	somewhere	that	I did	not	want	to	go,	but	I	could	not	stay	behind.	There	was	a	knife, perhaps	the	knife	that	had	killed	me,	and	sometimes	I	became	the	unicorn and	Pam	or	Roxie	rode	me,	and	sometimes	I	was	just	me,	wanting	to	be alive	so	I	could	do	whatever	I	chose,	but	I	knew	that	if	I	had	been alive,	I	would	have	chosen	to	be	there	with	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	school	the	next	day,	the	bus	arrived	too	close	to	the	start	of	the day	for	anyone	to	question	me.	At	recess,	the	kids	gathered	around,	and Wayne	Lawson	asked,	"Your	Pa's	an	atheist,	ain't	he?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	"I'm	one,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	blinked,	then	said,	"You're	going	to	hell." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	if	there	isn't	one." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	must	have	expected	that	there	would	be	consequences	to	telling	that	to Wayne	Lawson,	but	I	did	not	think	they	would	come	from	Roxie.	She	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	don't	really	not	believe	in	God?"	Dickison's	entire	second	grade had	added	"atheist"	to	its	vocabulary	overnight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	The	world	made	more	sense	to	me	now,	and	so	did	Pa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Roxie	said,	"You	wouldn't	tell	a	teacher	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	would." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	Lawson	said,	"Bet	not." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p569"></a>Ronnie	defended	me.	"He	said	he	would,	didn't	he?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Roxie	said,	"I'll	get	a	teacher,	and	you'll	see." </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	of	the	kids	followed	Roxie	in	her	search	for	the	playground	monitor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	immediately	went	into	the	boy's	bathroom.	If	they	could	not	find	me before	the	bell	rang,	I	would	be	safe	in	class.	I	did	not	have	a	plan beyond	that.	Perhaps	I	thought	everyone	would	forget	I	had	said	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	recess	had	just	begun,	and	either	someone	had	seen	me	go	into	the boy's	room	or	someone	had	realized	there	was	no	place	else	I	could	hide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	boy	came	in,	looked	at	me,	and	went	out	again.	Then,	just	outside	the door,	Roxie	and	Pam	and	several	girls	began	chanting,	"Christopher's	a fraidy-cat,	Christopher's	a	fraidy-cat." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	hurried	out.	"Am	not.	I	had	to	go."	I	had	used	the	urinal,	but	I	had done	that	because	I	knew	you	should	never	lie,	so	whenever	possible,	you should	ensure	that	the	truth	could	protect	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether	they	accepted	that	because	they	believed	it	or	they	did	not	care once	they	had	me,	I	don't	know.	The	girls	led	me	to	where	Mrs.	Pickett stood	smiling	under	one	of	the	covered	walkways.	The	boys	followed	the girls.	The	number	of	watchers	had	probably	grown,	but	I	can't	remember if	I	noticed.	In	my	memory,	all	sixty	students	of	both	second-grade classes	were	there,	but	I	doubt	I	had	more	than	eight	or	ten	witnesses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	never	spoken	with	Mrs.	Pickett,	but	I	knew	the	smile	she	wore.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p570"></a>said	I	was	a	funny	little	boy	with	some	silly	ideas	that	she	could easily	set	straight.	I	was	afraid	she	was	right.	I	think	she	was	old, but	not	so	old	as	Mrs.	Howe	or	Mrs.	Robbins.	Her	hair	was	very	black, and	she	wore	glasses	that	swept	up	into	points	toward	either	side.	She said,	"You're	the	boy	who	doesn't	believe	in	God?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	ma'm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's	your	name?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Roxie	said,	"He's	Chris." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Pickett	said,	"He's	capable	of	answering	for	himself.	Aren't	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	ma'm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	do	remember	your	name?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	of	the	kids	laughed.	Mrs.	Pickett	nodded	slightly	to	her	audience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	ma'm,"	I	said.	"Christopher	Nix." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	you	don't	believe	in	God?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	ma'm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why	do	you	think	you	know	more	than	what's	in	the	Good	Book?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There's	no	dinosaurs	there,	ma'm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just	because	dinosaurs	aren't	mentioned	doesn't	mean	God	didn't	make them.	God	didn't	bother	to	list	every	kind	of	bug	in	the	Bible,	did	he?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	dinosaurs	are	big.	Why	didn't	God	put	them	in	the	Bible?	How'd	they fit	on	the	ark?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p571"></a>"They	didn't	fit	on	the	ark.	Don't	you	think	that's	why	there	aren't	any more	dinosaurs?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	God	told	Noah	to	take	two	of	every	living	creature,	didn't	he?	He didn't	say	to	leave	out	the	dinosaurs,	did	he?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Pickett	frowned,	which	should	have	been	a	warning.	"The	dinosaurs must've	died	before	the	flood.	Maybe	God	didn't	think	they	were important	to	people	since	they	had	all	died	so	long	ago.	Not	everything in	the	world	is	in	the	Bible,	but	everything	that's	important	is	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Isn't	that	so?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged	to	say	I	did	not	know,	which,	uttered	aloud,	would	have	meant she	was	right,	which	would	have	meant	I	was	wrong	and	Pa	was	wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	you	want	to	be	a	good	boy?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	ma'm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	can	you	be	good	if	you	don't	believe	in	God?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	Greeks	didn't	b'lieve	in	God.	They	b'lieved	in	Zeus	an'	Hercules an'	Mount	Olympus.	Didn't	they?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	was	because	they	lived	before	Jesus	came." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	were	good,	weren't	they?	And	there's	good	Indians,	aren't	there?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	course.	But	they	won't	go	to	heaven	unless	they	accept	Jesus	as their	savior.	It	says	so	in	the	Bible." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	the	Bible's	a	book." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p572"></a>"The	Bible's	the	book.	If	you	don't	think	it	has	all	the	important answers,	where	do	you	think	the	answers	are?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled.	"Would	you	like	to	teach	us	what	you	know	better	than	the Bible?"	Most	of	the	kids	laughed	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	ma'm,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	you	don't	believe	the	Bible,	why	should	you	be	good?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Because	you	feel	bad	when	you're	bad." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	why	do	you	feel	bad?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged.	"I	don't	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where	do	you	go	when	you	die?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	was	the	universe	created?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	know."	Someone	laughed,	so	I	added,	"And	I	don't	care." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Pickett's	smile	slammed	shut.	The	quiet	around	me	would	have	told all	I	needed	to	know,	even	if	I	had	not	been	able	to	see	her	expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	added,	"Ma'm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're	a	rude	and	ignorant	boy."	She	pointed	toward	a	patch	of sidewalk.	"You	can	sit	out	the	rest	of	the	recess	over	there.	Maybe	God will	show	you	the	error	of	your	ways." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	on	the	sidewalk,	knowing	everyone	knew	I	was	being	punished.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p573"></a>never	felt	as	though	Roxie	or	Ronnie	or	Pam	had	betrayed	me.	They	were my	friends,	and	their	demand	that	I	testify	to	Mrs.	Pickett	was	neither a	dare	nor	a	betrayal.	It	was	the	simplest	way	to	see	whether	I	believed an	impossible	thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	remember	my	childhood,	I	know	there	were	times	when	I	was	hot	or cold,	and	I	remember	a	number	of	sunburns	because	I	always	believed	that my	skin	should	tan	like	Pa's	rather	than	blister	like	Ma's,	but	I	have few	specific	memories	of	the	weather	making	me	uncomfortable.	Sitting	on the	sidewalk	in	the	sun	during	recess	is	one	of	them.	The	day	was	not cruelly	hot,	and	I	did	not	sit	there	for	a	particularly	long	time,	but	I remember	sweating,	and	squinting	in	the	late	morning	glare.	I	did	not think	about	God.	I	thought	about	what	I	had	said	to	Mrs.	Pickett,	and whether	she	was	being	fair.	I	had	rarely	been	punished	in	school,	and never	by	a	teacher	who	wasn't	my	own.	I	liked	hearing	adults	tell	me	how polite	I	was.	My	appreciation	of	the	deadly	intricacies	of	manners	was at	least	as	old	as	my	love	of	watching	urbane	cowboy-adventurers	on	"Bat Masterson",	"Have	Gun,	Will	Travel",	and	"Maverick."	I	sat	on	the concrete	while	kids	played	ball	games	around	me.	My	pride	had	been	hurt, and	my	vanity	had	been	hurt,	and	when	Pa	heard	about	this,	my	behind would	hurt,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riding	the	bus	home,	Pam	and	Roxie	and	Ronnie	said	Mrs.	Pickett	should</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p574"></a>not	have	done	what	she	did,	but	I	should	not	have	done	what	I	did, either.	Roxie	asked	if	I	had	changed	my	mind	about	God,	and	I	said	I	had not,	and	then	we	talked	about	other	things.	My	atheism	did	not	matter	to them.	I	was	the	boy	who	talked	like	a	Yankee;	not	believing	in	God	was the	sort	of	thing	they	expected	from	Northerners.	Which	I	would	not	have minded,	had	I	felt	like	one.	In	Minnesota,	everyone	said	I	had	a southern	accent.	I	was	born	in	the	South.	My	memories	of	life	before Dogland	were	dim	memories	of	another	southern	state.	Once	when	we	argued on	the	playground	about	who	was	the	better	southerner,	famous	failed generals	blurred	in	my	mind,	and	I	claimed	to	be	related	to	Robert	E. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lee	rather	than	George	Custer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	Dogland,	I	told	Pa	what	had	happened	at	school.	When	I	finished,	he put	his	hand	on	my	shoulder	and	said,	"Well,	Mark	Christopher,	you learned	a	valuable	lesson	today."	He	said	I	had	given	a	fair	answer	to Mrs.	Pickett's	question,	and	there	were	a	lot	of	Christians	like	her	in the	world,	though	I	shouldn't	assume	they	were	all	like	her.	He	told	me about	the	fourth	Crusade,	when	European	knights	set	out	to	free Jerusalem	from	the	Moors	and	sacked	the	Christian	city	of	Constantinople instead.	He	talked	about	people	who	did	the	right	thing	regardless	of the	consequences,	about	Gandhi	and	Martin	Luther	King	and	Jesus,	but	the Jesus	Pa	talked	about	was	not	my	Sunday	school's	handsome	blond	man	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p575"></a>pristine	robe	who	hugged	children	and	sheep. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p576"></a>Governments	adore	phrases	like	"by	whatever	means	may	be	necessary."	On October	10,	the	U.S.	Congress	employed	it	in	a	resolution	telling	the world	how	they	would	defend	American	interests	in	West	Berlin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	Friday	was	the	first	night	I	ever	spent	away	from	my	family. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handyman	and	Jordy	picked	me	up	when	they	came	for	Lurleen	after	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handyman	had	asked,	"How's	your	Pa?"	and	I	had	said,	"Fine."	Then	he	had asked,	"How's	your	Ma?"	and	I	had	said,	"Fine"	again.	He	had	not	tried to	ask	anything	more,	because	Jordy	and	I	were	too	busy	telling	jokes and	laughing	in	the	back	of	their	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	lived	in	the	country	in	a	wooden	house	that	seemed	enormous compared	with	our	two-room	motel	unit.	I	figured	they	were	rich,	and	the six	automobiles	on	blocks	around	their	house	bolstered	that	impression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	had	a	number	of	younger	brothers,	all	littler	than	either	of	us, so	they	could	be	bossed	around	and	ignored. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	always	liked	music,	but	the	only	recording	that	I	had	loved	before that	visit	was	the	theme	song	to	the	Robin	Hood	TV	show	that	Ma	would sometimes	play	over	the	loudspeakers	at	Dogland	when	I	asked	her.	Jordy had	an	enormous	collection	of	records,	twenty	or	thirty	or	more, including	one	about	a	cowboy	named	Johnny	Ringo	that	was	as	good	as	any TV	show.	The	prize	of	his	collection	was	the	funniest	thing	I	had	ever</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p577"></a>heard.	One	side	was	"Rindercella,"	in	which	a	man	tried	to	tell	the Cinderella	story	and	got	all	the	words	wrong.	The	other	was	the	story	of a	southerner	who	went	up	north	and	saw	a	sign	saying	"Hockey	Here Tonight."	In	the	course	of	the	story,	you	could	tell	he	thought	hockey meant	doodoo.	For	the	next	week	or	two,	you	could	say	"Her	Two	Sad Blisters"	or	"He	dropped	it,	and	I	don't	blame	him,"	to	either	of	us, and	we	would	laugh,	reeling	around	the	room,	clutching	the	furniture	and falling	to	the	floor,	unable	and	unwilling	to	stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Greenleafs	prayed	before	supper	and	breakfast,	and	I	bowed	my	head to	join	them.	Pa	had	said	that	being	an	atheist	didn't	give	me	any	right not	to	respect	people's	beliefs	when	I	was	in	their	homes.	After	eating, Jordy,	Handyman,	and	the	little	brothers	all	thought	it	was	funny	when	I took	my	plate	and	glass	to	the	sink,	but	Lurleen	smiled,	so	I	didn't	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	thank	the	Greenleafs	for	having	me	over,	Jordy	spent	Saturday	at Dogland.	We	hosed	the	dog	pens	in	the	morning	and	followed	Mr.	Drake with	the	cart	of	dog	dookey	to	the	pit	in	back.	Later,	Little	Bit	and Digger	insisted	on	following	the	two	of	us	around,	even	though	Jordy	was my	guest.	Jordy	had	matches	and	a	cherry	bomb	that	he	had	saved	since the	Fourth	of	July.	The	four	of	us	went	back	by	the	dog	turd	pit.	Jordy caught	a	lizard,	or	maybe	he	found	a	dead	one.	He	put	the	cherry	bomb	in the	lizard's	mouth,	lit	it,	and	threw	it	into	the	dog	turd	pit.	Jordy, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p578"></a>Little	Bit,	Digger,	and	I	ran	shrieking	in	horrified	glee	as	globs	of turd	and	lizard	threatened	to	fall	on	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	afternoon,	Ma	and	Lurleen	stayed	at	Dogland	while	Mr.	Drake,	Pa, and	we	four	kids	went	for	a	ride	on	the	Dixie	Belle.	Mr.	Drake	had	a six-pack	of	beer,	I	think,	and	I	can't	remember	who	suggested	we	tow	the duck	boat	behind	the	houseboat	with	the	kids	in	it.	Pa	and	Mr.	Drake discussed	the	arguments	against	it,	and	agreed	that	all	four	kids	could swim,	and	we	had	life	jackets,	and	Pa	could	keep	the	Dixie	Belle	at	its slowest	speed.	They	did	not	need	to	discuss	the	arguments	in	favor.	We loudly	told	them	how	much	fun	it	would	be.	They	did	not	need	to	note	how nice	it	would	be	to	laze	along	the	river	on	a	day	fit	for	summer	without four	kids	running	and	shrieking	around	their	legs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	at	the	stern	of	the	low,	flat-bottomed	duck	boat,	and	Jordy	sat	at the	bow.	Pa	hollered	to	ask	if	he	should	open	the	throttle	a	bit,	and everyone	yelled	that	he	should.	We	felt	we	were	flying	over	the	surface of	the	Suwannee,	though	we	probably	traveled	at	four	or	five	knots.	We had	promised	not	to	stick	our	arms	or	legs	outside	the	duck	boat,	so	we did	not,	though	every	instinct	demanded	that	we	dip	a	finger	or	a	hand into	the	water	to	create	new,	tiny	wakes	that	would	mingle	within	the large	one	made	by	the	Dixie	Belle	and	the	smaller	one	made	by	the	duck	boat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First	we	were	racing	along,	then	water	was	surging	over	the	bow	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p579"></a>duck	boat.	As	soon	as	the	hull	had	dug	into	the	Suwanee,	the	entire	duck boat	tilted	forward	and	to	the	side,	or	maybe	the	tilting	began	when kids	began	to	jump	out.	Since	I	was	in	the	stern,	I	waited	until	the others	were	out	of	my	way,	and	then	I	leaped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	river	from	beneath	looked	oddly	like	it	did	from	above,	a	cool	world without	boundaries	or	gravity,	defined	by	shafts	of	light	that	seemed	to fall	through	green	glass.	My	life	jacket	pulled	me,	and	I	thought	that direction	must	be	up,	so	I	let	it	take	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	the	water	grew	darker	as	I	was	drawn	onward.	Something	hard	stopped me.	My	head	and	my	life	jacket	were	pressed	against	it.	In	the	darkness, I	could	not	see	to	know	where	I	was,	but	my	skin	recognized	the	smooth sheet	metal	seat	of	the	capsized	and	sinking	duck	boat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	soft	might	have	bumped	my	feet.	I	kicked,	lurching	forward, and	rose	again,	only	to	be	stopped	again	by	slick	metal.	I	gasped,	and air	filled	my	lungs.	Remembering	it	now,	I	don't	believe	I	should	have had	enough	light	to	see,	but	perhaps	diffracted	light	in	the	water helped	me.	The	deck	of	the	duck	boat	was	a	ceiling	an	inch	or	two	above my	nose.	I	had	risen	into	a	narrow	pocket	of	air	within	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pushed	sideways	to	escape	and	was	blocked	by	the	hull	of	the	boat.	The life	jacket	fought	me	as	I	tried	to	push	myself	down	and	under.	I	had read	about	detectives	with	names	like	the	Thinking	Machine	who	found</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p580"></a>themselves	in	places	with	little	air.	I	had	seen	people	on	TV	locked	in vaults	as	others	on	the	outside	raced	to	free	them	before	the	oxygen, and	they,	expired.	I	knew	the	duck	boat	was	sinking	deeper	with	me inside	it,	because	the	light	grew	darker,	and	I	knew	I	had	to	get	out quickly.	I	was	not	frightened.	I	had	been	presented	with	a	problem,	and I	saw	the	solution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	pushed	again	against	the	boat's	deck,	forcing	myself	down, something	soft	may	have	bumped	my	legs	again.	Then	I	was	under	the	hull, and	then	I	was	rising	toward	light,	and	then	my	head	was	in	the	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy,	Little	Bit,	and	Digger	floated	near	me,	and	the	Dixie	Belle	was forty	or	fifty	yards	away,	drifting	or	backing	slowly	with	Mr.	Drake	at the	wheel.	Pa	was	in	the	water,	fully	dressed,	swimming	directly	toward me	with	strong,	overhead	strokes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	we	all	had	gotten	into	the	houseboat,	Pa	and	Mr.	Drake	hauled	up the	submerged	duck	boat	on	the	line	still	attached	to	its	bow.	Jordy said,	"Boy,	that	sure	were	fun!	Can't	we	do	that	again?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I	don't	think	so." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jordy	said,	"Dang." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"No	one	was	hurt." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Let's	keep	it	that	way,"	and	then,	"Christ,	Chris,	when	you didn't	come	up,	I	figured	you	for	a	goner	for	sure." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p581"></a>He	was	looking	at	me,	so	I	nodded,	embarrassed	about	causing	so	much trouble	over	such	a	small	thing.	No	one	speculated	whose	fault	it	had been	that	the	duck	boat	had	nose-dived.	Wrapped	in	beach	towels,	we	sat in	the	back	of	the	Dixie	Belle	and	watched	the	water	and	the	trees	as	Pa turned	the	boat	to	bring	us	back	to	Hawkins	Spring	and	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	pointed.	"Look.	A	manatee." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	see	it,"	said	Mr.	Drake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	smiled.	"That's	all	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	drove	from	the	springs	to	the	highway,	Mrs.	DeLyon	walked	out	of the	house	behind	her	motel	and	waved	widely	to	us.	Pa	stopped	to	call, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hi,	Maggie,	how	you	been?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded	to	him,	and	gave	a	small	smile	that	included	us	all.	"I'm glad	you	got	in	a	last	swim	before	the	weather	turns	cool." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	laughed.	"Didn't	exactly	plan	on	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	all	fell	in	the	river,"	said	Jordy.	"It	were	great.	Chris	hid	under the	boat.	You	should'a'	seen	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged.	"Air	got	trapped	there.	You	could	breathe	and	everything." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,"	said	Mrs.	DeLyon.	"Quite	the	adventure." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	was	just	a	ducking,"	I	said,	as	Pa	said,	"Don't	rub	it	in." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"All's	well	that	ends	well." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	said,	"It	looks	like	I'm	going	to	lose	the	motel." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p582"></a>Pa	blinked,	we	kids	stared,	and	Mr.	Drake	said,	"Oh,	god,	Maggie,	your family's	had	that	place	forever." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled.	"Not	quite	forever." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"What	happened?	If	there's	anything	we	can	do--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shook	her	head.	"Thanks,	Luke.	I'd	get	by	if	it	was	just	the construction	sending	tourists	on	the	interstate,	or	just	the	Captain's Hideaway	Hotel	taking	a	big	bite	from	my	trade.	But	the	combination--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shook	her	head.	"And	investing	in	color	TVs	to	compete	was	a mistake.	You	want	a	good	deal	on	an	almost	new	set,	let	me	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"It	isn't	like	you	to	give	up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	laughed.	"Going	away	and	starting	over	isn't	the	same	as giving	up.	I've	done	it	before.	I	can	do	it	again." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"You	can't	get	a	loan	or	a	second	mortgage	or	something?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	said,	"I	might	if	John	Hawkins	didn't	want	the	springs,	and if	he	wasn't	teamed	up	with	Nick	Lumiere,	who's	got	the	lion's	share	of the	Dickison	Bank	stock.	They're	foreclosing	on	the	first."	She	glanced at	Pa.	"I'm	sure	he'll	let	you	keep	your	boat	docked	for	the	winter,	at least." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shrugged.	"He's	made	a	couple	offers	for	Dogland.	I	expect	he'll	want to	stay	on	my	good	side." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"But	what	about	the	springs?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p583"></a>Mrs.	DeLyon	laughed	and	touched	Little	Bit's	forehead.	"It'll	be	there, no	matter	who	owns	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"He	could	close	it	off,	turn	it	into	a	private	club	or something." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	said,	"If	there's	any	way	I	can	stop	him,	be	sure	that	I	will." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Good	luck,	Maggie." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	said,	"Thanks,	Luke.	You,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"If	you	need	a	hand	with	anything--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled	at	him.	"I'm	glad	you	quit	the	company.	The	beard	suits	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	drove	back	to	Dogland,	Pa	said,	"Maggie's	one	hell	of	a	woman." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah,"	said	Mr.	Drake.	"Sometimes	you	fail	to	appreciate	the	ones who're	closest	to	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p584"></a>On	Saturday,	October	20,	1962,	the	front	pages	of	most,	and	perhaps	all, American	newspapers	showed	U.S.	intelligence	photos	of	Russian medium-range	ballistic	missile	bases	in	Cuba,	ready	to	deliver	nuclear warheads	within	minutes	to	any	American	city.	That	same	day,	China's armies	in	Tibet	seized	48,000	square	miles	of	land	along	the	old	border between	India	and	Tibet.	On	Monday	the	22nd,	President	Kennedy	spoke	on television,	warning	the	world	that	the	U.S.	would	not	back	down	from	any military	threat.	Barbed	wire	went	up	on	the	beaches	of	Key	West.	Across America,	the	business	in	bomb	shelters	was,	well,	booming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	if	anything	changed	at	school.	Adults	did	not	talk	about	atomic war	when	kids	were	present.	On	the	bus,	Wayne	Lawson	announced	that	we ought	to	bomb	all	the	commies	like	we	bombed	the	Japs,	and	a	few	kids cheered,	but	that	was	a	sentiment	of	the	time	that	may	have	had	nothing to	do	with	what	was	happening	a	few	hundred	miles	from	Latchahie	County. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	don't	remember	teachers	telling	us	what	to	do	if	bombs	fell.	I remember	fire	drills,	at	least	one	of	which	must	have	occurred	during the	last	weeks	of	October.	We	would	stand	beside	our	desks,	then	march out	of	the	building	by	rows	to	stand	quietly	in	the	dusty	yard,	waiting for	our	next	instructions.	Either	second-graders	were	too	young	to participate	in	bomb	drills,	or	some	school	official	decided	that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p585"></a>crouching	with	our	heads	between	our	knees	under	wooden	desks	in	wooden buildings	would	not	help	anyone	if	bombs	fell	near	enough	for	us	to notice.	In	those	last	weeks	of	October,	my	contemplation	of	death centered	on	ghosts,	witches,	and	vampires.	Christmas	might	have	the	best presents,	but	you	pay	for	them	by	dressing	up	and	going	to	church	and eating	big	meals	where	you	have	to	sit	still	for	hours	and	be	polite	to all	the	adults.	Halloween	is	the	only	American	holiday	when	fun	belongs to	anyone	who	takes	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	Monday	night,	Ma	worked	on	a	pirate	costume	for	me.	She	hated	sewing and	seemed	to	stick	herself	whether	she	wore	thimbles	or	not.	Without looking	up	from	her	stitching,	she	said,	"It'd	be	nice	to	go	see	my	folks." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	glanced	up	from	a	magazine.	"Now?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well."	Ma	turned	her	hand	in	a	way	that	meant	she	would	dismiss	the thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"The	kids're	in	school." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	didn't	mean	we	should	do	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	why're	we	talking	about	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	doesn't	have	to	be	a	point	to	everything,	Luke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why	not?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	shook	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"That	was	a	joke." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p586"></a>Ma	said,	"Oh.	I	think	I'll	call	Mimmy	and	Pop-pop	tonight,	then." </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	all	waited.	When	Pa	did	not	say	she	shouldn't,	I	said,	"Is	it	a birthday?"	Long	distance	calls	cost	money,	and	stamps	were	only	three cents.	I	had	known	that	as	long	as	I	could	remember. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	Ma	said.	"It'd	just	be	nice	to	talk	to	the	folks.	Wouldn't	you like	to	talk	to	Grandma	and	Grandpa?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah!"	Little	Bit	said,	and	"Yay!"	I	said,	and	Digger	clapped	his	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	talk	forever,"	Pa	said.	"Or	when	the	phone	bill	comes,	we'll	be wishing	it	was	the	end	of	the	world." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	can't	remember	if	the	phone	in	the	house	was	out,	or	if	Ma	said	she wanted	to	call	from	the	restaurant	where	it'd	be	quieter.	When	all	three of	us	kids	said	we	wanted	to	talk	to	Grandma	and	Grandpa,	Pa	said,	"Not much	quieter."	Ma	said	we	could	say	hello,	but	then	Little	Bit	and Digger	had	to	go	straight	to	bed.	Sometimes	there	were	advantages	to being	the	oldest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	restaurant,	Digger	listened	to	the	phone	and	laughed	and	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah,"	a	couple	of	times	and	"No"	about	as	many.	Little	Bit	talked about	school,	our	cats	(Tiger	had	been	joined	by	an	orange	tabby	Little Bit	called	Waffle),	the	soft	yellow	chicks	that	Pa	had	bought	and	was keeping	in	cages	behind	the	house,	the	black	and	white	goat	that	Mary and	Joe	had	given	us	who	liked	to	follow	Digger	around,	and	the	sign	Ma</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p587"></a>had	made	for	the	cage	of	Pirate,	Mary	and	Joe's	other	gift,	that	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tripod	Hound--Muttus	Americanus	Peglegus."	Ma	finally	had	to	tell Little	Bit	that	was	enough.	While	I	talked,	Ma	gave	Little	Bit	a flashlight,	Little	Bit	took	Digger's	hand,	and	they	went	back	to	the	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grandma	asked	if	I'd	been	good	and	how	my	grades	were	and	whether	I needed	new	clothes	for	school.	Then	Grandpa	got	on	and	asked	how	his	big boy	was,	and	whether	I	needed	any	more	comic	books,	because	he	wouldn't want	to	send	me	any	if	I	didn't	need	them,	and	he	read	off	the	list	of titles	I	had	mailed	to	him	to	make	sure	I	didn't	want	to	subtract	any, which	I	didn't,	or	add	any,	which	I	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Ma	and	I	walked	back	to	the	house,	I	hurried	ahead	to	show	her	I knew	there	was	nothing	to	fear	in	the	dark	and	to	get	back	first	if there	was.	A	voice	from	the	night	startled	me,	but	not	Ma.	Mr.	Drake	was sitting	on	the	step	of	his	trailer.	He	said,	"Anything	exciting?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"No,	not	really.	I	just	called	my	folks." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	said,	"That's	nice,"	like	the	words	meant	what	they	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"How's	Gwenny	like	Jacksonville?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hard	to	say.	She	doesn't	have	a	phone	in	her	dorm.	I'd	swear	she	knew how	to	write	before	she	went	to	college." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	laughed.	"Being	busy's	a	good	sign." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah.	I	didn't	think	I'd	miss	her	that	much.	You	heard	that	Tepes	boy</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p588"></a>moved	up	to	there	to	be	with	her?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	may	just	have	to	accept	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why	is	it	kids're	so	much	younger	than	we	were	when	we	were	their	age?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	smiled.	"Does	seem	that	way,	doesn't	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	pointed	at	me.	"Hey,	Chris,	I	never	told	you	the	end	of	the story." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	story?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	remember.	The	king	and	his	friend,	the	best	knight	in	the	land.	And the	woman	they	loved." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	yeah.	Is	there	more	fighting	in	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	bet.	I	can't	think	of	a	story	that	doesn't	have	some	fighting	in it.	Want	to	hear	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"What	about	Digger	and	Little	Bit?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"It's	probably	a	little	mature	for	them	now.	Digger'd fall	asleep,	and	God	only	knows	what	Little	Bit'd	make	of	it.	If	I	can't tell	it	to	them	later,	Chris	can." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah,	Ma.	I	can	do	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	see	I'm	out-voted." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	right	then."	Mr.	Drake	tapped	out	a	cigarette.	"Want	one?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	thanks.	I	think	I	really	have	quit." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"I'll	get	you	a	cigarette	if	you	want	one!"	and	Ma	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p589"></a>Among	the	novelty	items	sold	at	Dogland's	gift	shop	were	exploding slivers	that	you	tucked	into	the	ends	of	cigarettes	to	surprise	smokers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Ma	decided	she	wanted	to	quit,	she	gave	us	permission	to	hide	the slivers	in	her	cigarettes.	She	exploded	one	for	our	benefit,	and	a	day or	two	later,	she	decided	she	wanted	just	one	cigarette.	She	took	a	pack from	a	drawer	where	she	did	not	think	Little	Bit	or	I	would	have	gone, and	when	it	exploded,	she	decided	she	really	wasn't	starting	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	lit	a	match,	enclosing	us	all	in	a	dim	circle	of	light,	and then	his	glowing	cigarette	tip	was	the	brightest	source	in	the	night	as he	talked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sick	king	stayed	at	his	castle,	and	his	knights	returned,	one	by one,	until	only	two	were	still	hunting	for	the	magic	cup	that	would	save them	all.	Then	the	king's	best	friend	rode	back	without	it.	Only	a	crazy boy	who	wanted	to	be	a	knight	was	still	out	there,	dead	or	searching, and	he	never	returned,	so	no	one	knows	his	fate	for	sure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	king's	son	gathered	to	his	side	the	most	bitter	knights,	the	ones whose	sense	of	failure	drove	them	to	do	anything	that	would	make	them feel	powerful	again.	The	king's	best	friend	stayed	apart	from	them.	The king's	son	saw	that	the	friend	and	the	queen	loved	each	other,	so	he arranged	for	them	to	be	arrested	together	on	a	charge	of	betraying	the king.	The	king's	best	friend	ran	away	with	the	queen,	so	when	the	king's</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p590"></a>son	attacked	with	the	bitter	knights,	the	king	was	alone.	The	king	and the	king's	son	killed	each	other	in	battle,	and	the	queen	entered	a monastery,	and	what	happened	to	the	best	friend,	I	was	not	sure,	but that	did	not	seem	to	matter	when	everything	had	been	lost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	don't	win?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	the	cavalry	doesn't	show	up,	if	that's	what	you	mean.	But	they did	a	lot	of	good	things,	and	today,	they	do	even	more	because	people try	to	be	like	them,	helping	people	who	need	help	and	facing	any opponent	if	the	cause	is	just." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So,	d'you	think	the	queen	and	the	friend	should'a'	gone	off	together?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	quiet,	then	asked	more	gently,	"Even	though	they	loved	each other,	and	the	king	neglected	the	queen	while	he	built	his	empire?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No.	They	got	married." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Some	people	get	divorced." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah.	But	there	was	the	king's	son." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"He	wasn't	the	queen's	son." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	he	was	her	step-son,	right?	So	he	was	her	son.	And	she	kept	being</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p591"></a>with	the	king's	friend	instead	of	with	the	king	or	the	son." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"So	it's	all	her	fault?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	always	surprised	when	adults	did	not	understand	stories.	I	shook my	head.	"It	was	the	friend's	fault.	He	was	s'posed	to	be	the	best knight.	If	he'd'a'	kept	trying	instead	of	giving	up,	it	would'a'	ended right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm,"	said	Mr.	Drake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"I	think	it's	bed-time	for	you,	young	man." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	don't	you	think	it's	a	silly	ending,	Ma?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	know,	Chris.	I	suppose	a	lot	of	endings	are	silly." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	'happily	ever	after.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	true."	She	looked	at	Mr.	Drake,	then	at	the	bar	of	light	that was	the	window	of	our	home,	then	at	me.	"'Happily	ever	after'	is	nice." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p592"></a>On	Tuesday	the	23rd,	the	Organization	of	American	States,	whose membership	included	most	South	and	North	American	nations	except	for Cuba,	formally	agreed	to	use	force	to	keep	weapons	from	entering	Cuba.	A U.S.	fleet	blockaded	Cuba	and	turned	away	Russian	ships. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Late	that	afternoon,	I	was	leaning	against	the	side	of	our	house, re-reading	my	comic	books	where	Little	Bit	or	Digger	couldn't	come pester	me	about	looking	at	them.	Pa	was	at	the	back,	fixing	the	dogs' </p>
<p class="calibre1">evening	meal.	I	heard	the	meat	grinder,	then	the	mixing	of	dog	food	in	a wheelbarrow	with	a	hoe,	and	paid	no	attention	to	them.	I	stopped	reading when	I	heard	Handyman	call,	"Luke,"	as	though	he	were	identifying	Pa rather	than	greeting	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	grunted,	as	if	lifting	or	setting	down	something,	then	said,	"Been awhile." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	ain't	changed	my	beliefs	none." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	why're	you	here?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well.	That's	a	good	question." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	I'm	fresh	out	of	good	answers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	like	this,	Luke.	Me'n'	some	of	the	boys	were	over	at	the	Roadhouse the	other	night,	and	you	kinda	come	up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	chuckled.	"It's	nice	to	know	I'm	getting	read	instead	of	ignored." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p593"></a>"Oh,	your	letters're	getting	read,	all	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	we	was	talking	about	what's	wrong	with	the	world	in	general	and Latchahie	County	in	particular.	Not	me,	mind	you.	I	was	mostly	drinking and	listening.	Folks	got	a	right	to	their	opinion.	Even	you'd	agree	to that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hell,	that's	my	whole	point,"	Pa	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	why	d'you	want	t'	force	folks	to	quit	prayin'	and	make	'em	go	to school	with	niggers?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	came	to	get	into	that?	I'm	willing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No.	That	ain't	it.	Here's	what	it	is.	One	o'	the	boys	said,	'That	Luke Nix	is	a	goddamn	nigger-lover.'	Which	I	allowed	was	so.	Then	one	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">'And	an	atheist	to	boot.'	And	I	agreed	with	that,	too.	Then	another	ol' </p>
<p class="calibre1">boy	said,	'He	beats	his	son	to	make	him	speak	out	against	God.'	And	I said,	'He	don't	beat	that	boy.	He	loves	them	kids	as	much	as	any	of	you love	yours,'	and	I	got	up	and	left." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	did?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	did." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well.	Thank	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	ain't	why	I	come	here,	Luke.	What's	true	is	true.	What	I	said	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">'em	didn't	make	a	damn	bit	of	difference.	I	got	a	call	saying	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p594"></a>boys're	resolved	to	get	every	godless	nigger-loving	commie	out	of Latchahie	County." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	laughed.	"There's	more'n	one?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neither	of	them	spoke	for	a	minute	or	so.	Then	Pa	said,	"People	say	a lot	of	things	when	they're	drunk." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well.	I	appreciate	this." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	only	Christian."	I	listened	to	Handyman's	steps	as	he	turned	and left.	After	a	moment,	I	heard	Pa's	hoe	sluicing	through	the	dog	food	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	fixed	a	super-potion	while	Pa	fed	the	dogs.	The	Flash	could	run	fast because	lightning	struck	a	bank	of	chemicals	that	spilled	over	him,	the Elongated	Man	drank	an	elixir	that	let	him	stretch	his	body	like	rubber, and	Hour	Man	took	a	pill	that	gave	him	super-strength	for	an	hour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doctor	Jekyll	and	the	Invisible	Man	both	drank	fluids	of	their	own invention	from	a	flask.	I	hated	pills,	so	Ma's	medicine	cabinet	was safe.	I	wished	I	had	a	flask	and	lightning,	but	neither	of	those	were crucial.	Power	comes	from	power,	so	I	needed	to	find	the	most	powerful fluids	I	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	a	chipped	red	plastic	tumbler	from	our	bathroom,	went	up	to	the restaurant,	and	asked	Ma	if	I	could	have	orange	juice	to	take	back	in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p595"></a>the	yard	where	I	was	playing.	She	smiled	and	said	I	certainly	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Pa	had	trained	horses,	he	had	bought	a	gallon	of	horse	tonic	that he	mixed	in	their	food.	Most	of	the	gallon	was	full	when	we	left Louisiana.	He	decided	that	if	it	was	good	for	horses,	it	was	good	for people.	He	kept	some	in	a	small	brown	glass	bottle	in	the	kitchen.	Every morning,	we	kids	had	to	add	as	many	drops	as	we	were	old	to	our	orange juice	and	drink	it	down.	Horse	tonic	was	a	dark,	bitter	fluid.	Whether you	stirred	it	into	the	orange	juice,	turning	it	all	the	color	of	rust, or	let	it	settle	on	the	bottom	to	drink	in	a	last,	bold	gulp,	it	tasted terrible.	Ma	refused	to	drink	it,	but	Pa	did,	so	we	had	to.	Now	that	I haven't	tasted	it	in	years,	I	remember	a	sense	of	amusement	and	shared hardship	as	we	kids	watched	each	other	measure	out	the	drops,	counting them	as	they	fell	from	a	stopper,	making	sure	no	one	else	got	by	with less	than	we	had	to.	Pa	never	told	us	that	he	had	a	gallon	in	storage, and	we	never	thought	to	wonder	why	the	little	brown	bottle	never	grew empty.	The	worst	things	in	life	do	not	require	explanations	when	you're young. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	filled	the	dropper,	a	good	thirty	or	forty	drops,	and	squirted	it	into the	orange	juice.	Impressed	with	my	resolution,	I	filled	it	again	and added	a	second	blast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	returned	to	our	yard,	Little	Bit	said,	"What	you	doing?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p596"></a>"Making	a	potion." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Magic?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	dummy.	It's	science." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	that	horse	tonic?	You're	the	dummy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	wait."	I	never	went	voluntarily	into	the	pump	house.	It	was	Pa's place,	where	he	kept	tools	and	curious	things	that	might	someday	have	a purpose.	He	sent	me	there	to	fetch	what	he	needed,	and	once	I	had	gone in	to	find	a	hammer,	and	had	stood	there	helplessly,	trying	to	identify a	hammer	among	all	the	dark	shapes	until	Pa	had	walked	in,	asked	what was	taking	me	so	long,	and,	when	I	said	I	couldn't	find	it,	had	reached out	onto	the	shelf	in	front	of	me,	picked	up	the	hammer,	and	walked	out without	saying	another	word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	pump	house	held	an	oil	gun	and	a	grease	gun	and	cans	and	bottles	of fluids	whose	name	and	purpose	I	did	not	know.	The	place	smelled	of petroleum	and	paint	and	old	wood.	I	always	remembered	that	a	snake	had been	found	there.	Though	we	rarely	saw	snakes	around	our	house	since	we had	moved	in,	things	might	run	out	or	tendrils	might	reach	up	through the	holes	in	the	wooden	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	carried	the	tumbler	into	the	shed	and	added	liquids.	Oil	shot	from	the oil	can	with	a	particularly	satisfying	burst,	and	turpentine	splashed with	the	scent	that	made	paint	bead	up	and	run	away,	and	gasoline</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p597"></a>powered	every	internal	combustion	engine	I	knew	of.	When	I	had	finished, I	stepped	into	the	sunlight	with	my	tumbler	full	to	the	brim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're	going	to	drink	that?"	Little	Bit	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	you	won't." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	I	will."	I	lifted	the	tumbler	to	my	lips.	The	smell	stopped	me.	I told	myself	that	if	science	was	easy,	someone	else	would	have	created	a super-potion	before	me,	but	that	did	not	help.	I	stuck	my	tongue	into	it to	test	it,	then	spat	that	out,	ran	to	the	side	of	the	house,	turned	on a	water	faucet,	and	rinsed	my	mouth	for	a	long,	long	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	expected	Little	Bit	to	laugh,	but	she	stood	beside	me.	When	my	mouth tasted	clean,	I	said,	"Promise	you	won't	tell	if	I	throw	it	away?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Throwing	away	something	you	took	was	wasting	it.	Little	Bit	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Okay."	We	went	together	behind	the	pump	house	and	poured	the	potion into	a	clump	of	long	weeds	where	no	one	would	find	the	evidence.	I	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Somebody	wants	to	hurt	Pa." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shook	her	head.	"Nobody	can	hurt	Pa." </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	dinner	time,	Rooster	Donati	stopped	in.	I	did	not	overhear	his conversation	with	Pa,	except	at	the	end	when	Rooster	stood	beside	his car	and	said,	"You	know	if	I	was	by	the	phone	or	the	radio	so	I	got	a call	right	away,	it'd	still	be	a	good	fifteen	minutes	'fore	you	could</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p598"></a>expect	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I	don't	expect	you	to	do	anything	more'n	a	person	can	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sheriff	Donati	drove	away.	He	may	have	understood	that	Pa	thought	what people	could	do	was	a	little	bit	more	than	their	best. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	day,	Pa	and	Mr.	Drake	left	Dogland	for	a	few	hours.	When	they returned,	Pa	had	an	old	single-barrel	shotgun.	He	laughed	as	he	told	Ma how	cheaply	they'd	gotten	it,	and	how	he	was	pretty	sure	it'd	fire.	When Ma	said	she	didn't	want	it	in	the	house,	Pa	said,	"I'm	sorry,	Susan,	it won't	be	much	use	anywhere	else,"	and	Ma	was	quiet	for	the	rest	of	the	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	gathered	us	kids	together,	and	we	walked	with	the	shotgun	back	to	the garbage	dump.	He	fired	the	gun	so	we'd	all	hear	how	loud	it	was	and	see what	buckshot	did	to	glass,	newspaper,	and	bottles.	After	he	removed	the shell,	he	let	us	each	hold	the	gun,	and	showed	us	how	to	carry	it	with the	barrel	pointing	down	so	if	it	went	off,	no	one	would	be	hurt,	and	he told	us	he	doubted	there	would	ever	be	any	reason	why	we	should	carry	it until	we	were	all	much	older.	Then	we	went	back	to	the	house,	and	he	put it	in	the	corner	of	the	closet,	pointing	it	out	to	us	and	saying	he	knew we	were	good	kids	so	he	wasn't	worried,	but	if	he	ever	suspected	we	had so	much	as	touched	the	shotgun	without	his	permission,	we	would	get	a spanking	so	bad	we'd	wish	that	gun	had	gone	off	and	killed	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p599"></a>On	Thursday	the	25th	at	the	United	Nations,	the	U.S.	showed	photos	of the	missile	bases	in	Cuba	to	establish	that	the	threat	was	real,	and	to announce	to	the	assembled	countries	that	the	U.S.	would	not	ignore	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Few	American	news	commentators	noted	that	the	U.S.	had	missiles	in Turkey	long	before	Russia	put	missiles	in	Cuba,	and	those	missiles presented	as	great	a	threat	to	the	Russians	as	the	Cuban	base	presented to	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	morning,	as	Little	Bit	got	off	the	bus	at	school,	Dorrie	Doodoo spat	on	her.	Little	Bit	hit	Dorrie,	and	Dorrie	hit	her	back,	and	because they	both	had	older	brothers,	they	both	fought	with	fists.	I	didn't	see it	start.	I	was	already	off	the	bus	and	halfway	across	the	school	yard talking	with	Ronnie	when	someone	yelled	"Fight!"	I	had	time	to	see	who it	was,	but	not	enough	to	sort	through	the	applicable	rules:	Nixes should	not	fight	at	school.	Nixes	should	not	interfere	in	a	fair	fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nixes	should	protect	each	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bus	driver	and	a	teacher	separated	Little	Bit	and	Dorrie.	Neither was	bleeding,	but	their	faces	were	flushed	from	blood	or	bruises,	and their	hair	was	tangled.	As	they	were	led	away,	they	continued	to	scream at	each	other,	Dorrie	Doodoo	yelling	"Your	father's	a	nigger-lover!"	and Little	Bit	yelling,	"You're	doodoo	and	you're	stupid	and	everybody	hates</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p600"></a>you!"	I	started	to	follow,	but	the	teacher	told	us,	"These	girls	are going	to	the	principal.	The	rest	of	you	get	to	class	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	learned	that	Mr.	Hadley	spanked	them	both	with	the	round	paddle.	If there	was	a	paddle	with	holes	in	it,	Little	Bit	had	not	seen	it,	but	the round	one	had	hurt	enough.	We	both	knew	it	wouldn't	hurt	as	much	as	the spanking	she	would	get	at	home	for	fighting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	when	the	school	bus	let	us	off,	Ma	and	Pa	both	came	to	meet	us	by the	Heart	Tree.	Little	Bit	and	I	said,	"Hi,"	very	tentatively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Hi,	you	two." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	hugged	Little	Bit	and	said,	"You	all	right,	little	darling?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"That	smug	bastard	Hadley	gave	me	a	call.	He	said	you	started	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	shook	her	head.	"She	spit	on	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	figured	you	didn't.	You	don't	either	of	you	have	to	worry	about Hadley.	I	told	him	if	he	thought	hitting	people	was	a	good	way	to	solve problems,	I'd	be	glad	to	meet	up	with	him,	but	if	he'd	rather	talk,	he should	tell	me	if	you	misbehave,	and	your	Ma	and	I'll	figure	what	should be	done.	I	don't	know	if	I	should	spank	my	kids,	but	I	know	damn	well	no one	else	should."	He	smiled.	"Got	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	laughed.	"Yes,sir!	We	got	it!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"You	didn't	have	to	hit	that	girl,	Letitia." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p601"></a>Little	Bit	nodded.	"She	spit	on	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Jesus	says	to	turn	the	other	cheek." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let	her	spit	on	me	twice?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She's	not	as	smart	as	you.	You	don't	have	to	lower	yourself	to	her	level." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	squinted	at	Ma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"What's	the	punishment	for	spitting	on	someone	at	school?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Going	to	the	principal's	office." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So,	by	fighting,	she	got	the	same	punishment	she	would've	gotten,	and you	got	punished,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I	don't	think	that's	exactly	what	Jesus	had	in	mind	when	he said	to	turn	the	other	cheek." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"It	works	either	way,	doesn't	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p602"></a>On	Friday,	three	or	four	kids	were	missing	from	my	class,	and	the Lawsons	had	not	gotten	on	the	bus,	but	if	there	was	anything	truly unusual,	I	did	not	notice	it.	When	I	returned	from	school,	I	ran	through the	passway	in	the	privacy	fence,	then	skidded	on	the	heels	of	my	cowboy boots.	Far	to	one	side	of	the	yard,	close	to	the	fence	but	not	far	from our	house	and	Mr.	Drake's	trailer,	Ethorne	tossed	dirt	with	a	shovel from	a	hole	several	feet	deep,	approximately	eight	feed	wide,	and perhaps	twice	as	long.	At	the	other,	shallower	end	of	the	hole,	Digger was	helping	with	a	plastic	beach	shovel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"What	you	doing,	Ethorne?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's	it	look	like?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Digging." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	you	are." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	why?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	now,	that's	another	question	entirely."	He	wiped	his	forehead	with a	handkerchief	and	continued	to	dig.	"I'm	figuring	on	making	us	all rich.	First,	me	and	Digger'll	dig	us	this	hole	to	China	and	set	up	a toll	booth	at	each	end.	Then	any	time	someone	wants	to	get	to	Peking	or America	faster'n	by	jet	plane,	they	can	just	pay	my	toll	and	jump	on through." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p603"></a>I	laughed.	"But	they'd	come	out	upside	down." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Didn't	I	say	there	was	money	in	this	for	all	of	us?	You	sit	on	a	stool at	the	middle	of	the	Earth.	Whenever	someone	comes	by,	you	grab	'em, spin	'em	right	around,	take	your	tip,	and	say,	'thank	you,	sir,'	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">'thank	you,	ma'm,'	just	as	nice	as	could	be.	You	think	you'd	like	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah."	I	laughed	again.	"But	why're	you	really	digging	it,	huh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	a	question--"	Ethorne	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	had	stepped	into	the	yard.	As	I	turned	and	looked,	Mr.	Lumiere smiled	and	said,	"Hello." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Ain't	nobody	here	you'd	be	lookin'	for." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why,	Ethorne,	sounds	like	you	don't	properly	value	yourself	or	either of	the	masters	Nix." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Hi,	Mr.	Lumiere.	Pa's	up	front	and	Ma's	out	back." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	nodded.	"That'd	be	right	useful	if	I	was	lookin'	for	them." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who	is	you	lookin'	for?"	Ethorne	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Lumiere	laughed.	"Same	reason	as	usual." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	picked	who	I	work	for." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	to	me.	"You'd	miss	Ethorne,	wouldn't	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p604"></a>Mr.	Lumiere	said,	"I	got	a	place	out	the	county	road	that	just	keeps	on growing,	and	I	keep	on	needing	good	supervisors.	If	Ethorne	had	a	chance at	a	good	position,	wouldn't	you	want	him	working	for	me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"It's	only	me	that's	got	a	say	in	what	I	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Really?"	said	Mr.	Lumiere.	"I	thought	you	believed	we	all	affect	each other.	I	certainly	thrive	by	that	principle." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"You	got	my	answer." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Lumiere	said,	"You	know	I'll	ask	again." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	know	I'll	answer	the	same." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Lumiere	laughed.	"Now,	Ethorne,	we	both	know	that	ain't	necessarily	so." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	and	Mr.	Drake,	talking	quietly	together,	came	through	the	back	gate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Hi,	is	something	wrong?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Lumiere	said,	"Oh,	I	was	just	trying	to	steal	your	help.	How're	you two?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	blinked,	and	Mr.	Drake	said,	"Just	fine." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Lumiere	nodded.	"Glad	to	hear	that.	Well,	things're	mighty	busy	for me	now,	so	I'll	mosy	along." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	I'm	sorry,"	Ma	said.	"If	we	could	offer	you	anything--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	take	you	up	on	that,"	Mr.	Lumiere	said.	"As	soon	as	I	can." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p605"></a>Sometime	after	dark,	after	Seth	and	Ethorne	had	left	and	we	had	all	gone to	Ma	and	Pa's	room	to	watch	TV,	we	heard	a	car	turn	into	the	driveway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"What's	that?"	and	then,	"Luke,	there's	a	car." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I'll	see	who	it	is." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Do	you	think	you	should	take,	uh,	a	light,	or	something?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	rolled	his	eyes	upward.	"Nah." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	stood	by	the	door	and	watched	while	we	kids	stayed	in	a	semi-circle around	the	TV	set.	Ma	put	her	knuckle	to	her	mouth	more	than	once,	and then	we	heard	Pa	call	toward	the	trailer,	"Artie!	Hey,	Artie!	You	got company!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,"	Ma	said	happily,	and	we	had	already	come	to	the	door	before	she said,	"Look,	kids." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gwenny	Drake	stepped	into	the	yellow	light	of	the	porch	just	as	the	door to	Artie	Drake's	trailer	banged	open.	Mr.	Drake	said,	"Gwenny!"	at	the same	moment	she	said,	"Daddy!"	and	they	hugged.	Mr.	Drake	held	her	away from	him	and	said,	"I'm	glad	you	came.	Nothing's	wrong	at	school,	is	it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	look	great.	You	really	do.	You	weren't	worried	about--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed	and	touched	his	lips	with	her	finger.	"I	was	saying	it'd	be nice	to	see	you.	Johnny	pointed	out	there's	no	reason	we	couldn't." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind	Pa,	a	man	took	shape	in	the	darkness,	then	stepped	into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p606"></a>light.	Gwenny	wore	a	loose	white	shirt	and	tight	white	pedal	pushers, but	Johnny	Tepes	wore	a	black	T-shirt	and	jeans.	He	said,	"Hello,	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drake." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	moment	that	they	looked	at	each	other,	Gwenny	went	to	Ma	for	an embrace	and	said,	"Mrs.	Nix,	how've	you	been?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	I'm	always	fine,"	Ma	said.	"It's	wonderful	you	could	come	out	this weekend." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,"	Gwenny	said	with	a	shrug,	and	then	she	said,	"Hey,	Chris,	hey, Little	Bit,	hey,	Digger.	How're	you	guys	doing,	huh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	hit	Dorrie	Doo--"	Little	Bit	looked	at	Ma.	"Lawson." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gwenny	said,	"She	deserve	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	good	for	you,	then." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beyond	her,	Mr.	Drake	said,	"Hi,	Johnny."	He	indicated	the	trailer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Welcome	to	my	home." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	Tepes	nodded.	"Thank	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gwenny	said,	"Hey,	Chris,	you're	getting	handsomer	every	day.	Am	I	still your	best	girl?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	"Except	for	Jeannie	Peterson.	An'	Pam	and	Roxie." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"And	your	mother?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	down.	"Yeah." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p607"></a>They	both	laughed.	Gwenny	said,	"Well,	at	least	I'm	in	good	company." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey,"	Mr.	Drake	said,	"Why	don't	y'all	come	in	the	trailer,	and	we'll have	a	welcome	home	party?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I	don't	know--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"Yayy!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"We'll	just	sit	around	and	have	a	drink.	Nothing	special." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"If	we	won't	be	imposing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	asked	Gwenny,	"Gwen,	how	long	can	you	stay?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Till	Sunday,	at	least,	if	I	can	stay	on	the	couch.	Johnny's	still	got his	place." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"Oh,	yeah.	Where	is	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	Tepes	turned	his	head	in	a	way	that	might	have	meant	"west"	or might	have	meant	nothing	at	all.	He	said,	"Out	in	the	woods	aways." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"Up	the	county	road?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	Tepes	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"I	hear	you	used	to	do	a	lot	for	Nick	Lumiere." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Used	to,"	Johnny	Tepes	agreed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,"	Mr.	Drake	said,	"Come	on	in,	everyone." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Can	I	get	anything	from	the	kitchen?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thanks,"	said	Mr.	Drake,	shaking	his	head.	"You	wait	till	you	see what's	in	the	icebox.	I	was	thinking	to	surprise	you	with	a	Halloween</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p608"></a>party." </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	we	all	squeezed	into	Mr.	Drake's	tiny	trailer.	He	had	soda	pop	for the	kids,	and	wine	for	the	adults,	and	Neapolitan	ice	cream	for everyone,	which	was	Ma's	favorite,	and	he	didn't	mind	that	I	cut	around the	strawberry	to	eat	only	chocolate	and	vanilla.	Gwenny	told	us	about life	at	the	university,	and	Pa,	Mr.	Drake,	and	Johnny	Tepes	talked	about history	and	free	speech	in	Europe	and	early	America,	and	finally	Digger fell	asleep	on	the	rug,	which	was	the	signal	for	Ma	to	say	all	the	kids had	been	up	way	past	their	bedtime.	Little	Bit	said	she	wanted	to	stay, but	Pa	said	we	might	as	well	all	go.	Johnny	Tepes	said	he'd	go,	too,	but he'd	be	back	Saturday	after	supper	to	see	Gwenny. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p609"></a>On	Saturday	the	twenty-seventh,	Nikita	Khrushchev,	Premier	of	the	Union of	Soviet	Socialist	Republics,	wrote	privately	to	President	Kennedy, offering	to	remove	the	missiles	from	Cuba	if	Kennedy	agreed	to	take American	missiles	out	of	Turkey	and	leave	Cuba	alone.	Kennedy's	advisors said	the	U.S.	could	not	back	down	and	keep	the	world's	respect,	so	the American	government	continued	preparing	to	invade	Cuba. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	Saturday	began	as	usual,	with	hosing	the	pens	and	feeding	the	dogs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Ma	made	French	toast	for	breakfast,	which	was	always	a	treat,	Ethorne returned,	said	hello,	and	said	he'd	get	right	to	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	heard	the	door	close	behind	him.	Then	Little	Bit	said,	"Why's	Ethorne digging	that	big	hole?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	looked	at	Pa,	who	said,	"Well,	you've	probably	heard	something	about trouble	in	Cuba.	I	don't	think	anything's	going	to	come	of	it,	but	if something	does,	we'll	all	stay	down	in	there	till	it	blows	over." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In	the	hole?"	said	Little	Bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sure,"	Pa	said.	"It'll	have	a	roof	and	walls	and	a	floor.	It'll	be	like a	cabin." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	seen	pictures	in	Life	of	people	in	a	narrow	room	that	looked	like a	ship's	cabin	or	a	prison	cell	with	book	shelves,	nice	furniture,	a record	player,	and	a	television	set.	They	wore	evening	clothes,	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p610"></a>man	smoked	a	pipe	while	he	sat	reading	a	book	with	a	champagne	glass near	his	leather	chair,	and	the	woman	stood	in	the	middle	of	the	room with	her	champagne	glass	in	one	hand	and	a	cigarette	in	a	long	holder	in the	other.	I	said,	"It's	a	bomb	shelter?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"That's	right.	I'm	giving	your	Ma	an	early	Christmas	present." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"It's	one	present	I	don't	want	to	use." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"Will	there	be	a	war?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I	don't	see	how.	It's	not	a	war	anyone	can	win.	It's	like	a game	of	chicken	where	two	cars	are	racing	head-on	at	each	other.	What	do you	think	the	first	one	to	turn	aside	is?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"The	loser." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"And	the	one	who	doesn't	turn	aside?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	winner." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	if	they	both	decide	to	be	winners?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Oh,	Luke,	you're	so	cheery	some	mornings,"	and	brought	another plate	of	French	toast	to	the	table.	"Who	wants	seconds?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p611"></a>Mrs.	DeLyon	visited	that	afternoon.	Gwenny	and	I	were	helping	Mr.	Drake groom	the	dogs,	which	meant	he	gave	the	leash	to	me	instead	of	tying	it to	a	post,	and	Gwenny	got	her	face	licked	by	several	different	dogs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	said,	"Hello,	Artie,	Gwen,	Chris." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	smiled	over	his	shoulder	as	he	brushed	our	Borzoi.	"Hey,	Maggie." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Hi,	Mrs.	DeLyon.	I	hope	you	don't	have	to	go." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	do	I,"	said	Mrs.	DeLyon,	and	Mr.	Drake	and	Gwenny	said	the	same thing	half	a	second	later,	and	then	they	all	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gwenny	said,	"It's	the	pits." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	said,	"I	suppose	so." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"So.	Playing	tourist	today?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	nodded.	"Sometimes	you	forget	why	you	came	to	a	place." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gwenny	said,	"Dickison's	nice,	I	suppose,	but	it's	mighty	dead." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mmm,"	Mrs.	DeLyon	said.	"There's	a	band	at	the	Roadhouse.	The	something or	other	Cats,	I	forget." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gwenny	said,	"Johnny	and	I	are	going." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	was	thinking	I'd	go,	too."	She	looked	at	Mr.	Drake.	"Care	to	escort	me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	blinked	once,	then	smiled.	"Why,	of	course.	If	we	won't	cramp	the kids'	style." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uh-uh,"	Gwenny	said.	"Separate	cars." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p612"></a>Mr.	Drake	waggled	a	finger	at	her.	"I	never	ask	for	details,	young	lady." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	asked	Gwenny,	"So.	You	love	Johnny?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gwenny	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	he	loves	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gwenny	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	said,	"I	thought	so.	I	wanted	to	be	sure." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"People	do	change.	Things	aren't	always	their	fault." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	hope's	at	the	heart	of	most	bad	marriages." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	not	like	I've	only	known	him	for	a	couple	of	months.	If	I	say	he's changed,	I	don't	mean	he	might	change	or	he	says	he's	going	to	change	or I	hope	he's	going	to	change.	I	mean	he's	changed.	Maybe	you	think	I'm too	young	to	know--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	raised	her	hand.	"I	might	think	I'm	too	old.	Maybe	I shouldn't've	asked.	But	I	got	the	answer	I	hoped	to	hear." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"He	says	it's	been	years	since	he	worked	for	Nick." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mmm."	Mrs.	DeLyon	nodded.	"Who'll	pick	up	whom?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"I'll	be	by	at	eight.	No,	make	it	seven,	and	dinner's	on me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Done."	She	nodded	to	us,	turned,	and	walked	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	going	up	front,"	I	said,	and	I	ran	after	Mrs.	DeLyon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	caught	up	with	her,	she	said,	"An	escort.	I'm	honored." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p613"></a>"Mis'	DeLyon?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	you	believe	in	God?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Which	one?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"God.	You	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh.	Do	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	God's	nature." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed.	"I	know	where	you	got	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So,	what	do	you	think?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	think	God	is	the	moral	and	spiritual	quality	in	each	of	us." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	you	believe	in	God?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm.	Listen	to	me.	God	isn't	a	name.	It's	a	title.	A	description.	An idea.	You're	a	boy,	but	your	name	isn't	Boy.	John	Kennedy's	name	isn't President.	If	you	asked	me	whether	I	believed	in	the	President,	I	would say	yes,	but	that	would	not	mean	I	believed	John	Kennedy	existed.	It would	mean	I	believed	John	Kennedy	was	a	good	leader,	or	it	would	mean	I believed	in	the	office	of	President,	that	democracies	are	good	things, and	electing	presidents	is	a	good	way	to	have	a	democracy.	When	you	ask if	I	believe	in	God,	you're	not	asking	whether	I	believe	there	is	a	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You're	either	asking	whether	I	think	God	is	good,	or	whether	I	think there	should	be	a	God." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p614"></a>"Oh.	Okay." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	okay?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Okay,	is	God	good,	and	should	there	be	a	God?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"God	is	a	wonderful	idea.	Yes,	God	should	exist,	and	we	should	worship God	with	everything	we	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So,	is	God	good?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	at	me,	then	tapped	my	forehead	with	her	finger.	"You	really shouldn't	ask	what	you	already	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	that	time,	we	were	through	the	privacy	fence	and	into	our	yard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hammering	came	from	beyond	a	long	mound	of	dirt.	Ethorne	had	dug	it	five feet	deep,	and	now	he	was	putting	in	rough	wooden	walls	and	beams	to support	a	roof.	He	looked	up	as	we	came	near.	"Hey,	Mis'	DeLyon,	hey, Chris." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	smiled.	"Hi,	Ethorne.	Does	that	help?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Well,	Luke	figures	he's	doin'	something	for	his	family, and	Mis'	Susan	figures	about	the	same,	and	the	chil'en	all	figure they're	getting	somethin'	to	play	in,	and	I	figure	I'm	getting	something to	busy	myself	with.	So	I	guess	the	answer	is	it	sure	does." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're	doing	nice	work.	As	usual." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank	you,	ma'm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	do	you	think	of	Johnny	Tepes?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p615"></a>"They	say	what's	in	the	blood	don't	change." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	folks	do	change."	Ethorne	smiled.	"You	didn't	come	for	answers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled	too.	"I	just	wanted	to	know	I	wasn't	alone	in	having	none." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	about	Johnny	Tepes?"	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Oh,	he	used	to	be	kind	of	wild	when	he	was	young." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh.	Pa	was	pretty	wild." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	nodded.	"I	expect	he	was." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"You'll	really	give	up	the	Fountain	of	Youth?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	said,	"You	see	a	way	to	keep	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	that	wouldn't	create	more	problems	than	you	got." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	may	not	have	to	worry	about	it	anyway." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	hear	that,"	Ethorne	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ma	says	you	should	always	look	on	the	bright	side,"	I	said.	"Because tomorrow's	another	day." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	smiled	at	me.	"That's	what	we	always	hope." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p616"></a>The	last	customers	of	the	day	were	a	man	and	a	woman	with	dark	skin	and expensive	clothes.	The	woman	said	"Hello,	again,"	to	me	in	a	voice	like a	purr,	and	the	man	said,	"I'm	so	pleased	we	returned.	The	only	sound	as beautiful	as	silence	is	the	salute	of	dogs." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"It's	their	dinner	time.	Would	you	like	a	tour?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why,	yes,"	the	woman	said,	glancing	at	the	man.	"Who	wouldn't	want	a chance	to	learn	more	about	dogs?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neither	of	them	spoke	as	we	circled	the	pens.	At	the	end	of	my	speech, the	woman	thanked	me.	The	man	gave	me	a	quarter,	saying,	"Always	keep some	money	with	you.	You	never	know	when	you'll	need	a	coin." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	finished	the	walls	and	cross-braces	of	the	bomb	shelter	that afternoon.	He	asked	Pa	if	he	should	work	into	the	night,	but	Pa	said	he didn't	think	so.	He	and	Ethorne	covered	most	of	it	with	a	few	sheets	of plywood,	then	shoveled	some	dirt	over	them,	and	Pa	said,	"Good	enough." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	asked	how	we	would	get	into	the	bomb	shelter	if	we	needed	to.	Pa said,	"Jumping's	pretty	fast,"	and	we	kids	all	laughed.	Then	Pa	said they'd	add	a	ladder	or	steps	on	the	next	day,	and	Ma	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	supper,	Ma	made	made	squaw	corn,	my	other	favorite	family	meal.	She boiled	hotdogs,	diced	them,	then	poured	them	in	a	pan	with	a	can	of cream	corn.	That	was	its	purest	and	best	form,	which	sometimes	she	made</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p617"></a>when	she	was	fixing	food	just	for	us	kids,	but	that	night	she	fried bacon,	onions,	and	green	pepper,	added	them	to	the	corn,	then	beat	in	an egg	to	thicken	it.	That	was	the	way	Pa	liked	it,	after	he	had	darkened the	top	with	pepper.	I	picked	out	the	green	pepper	bits,	and	I	didn't mind	the	egg	as	long	as	it	was	mixed	in	well	enough	that	no	slimy globules	swam	like	white	worms	in	the	yellow	corn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	and	Pa	both	looked	up	when	a	car	entered	the	front	drive,	and	they smiled	when	Johnny	Tepes	got	out.	He	lifted	a	hand	in	greeting	as	he walked	past	the	front	window,	and	a	minute	or	two	later,	he	and	Gwenny walked	hand	in	hand	back	to	his	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Artie	Drake	entered	the	restaurant	through	the	back	door	as	we	were finishing.	He	said,	"I	made	a	last	walk	around	the	pens,	and	everything looks	fine.	It'll	be	a	few	more	days	before	Conchita	has	her	pups,	and Prince	Phillip's	dewclaw	is	healing	nice	and	clean." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	nodded,	and	Ma	said,	"Thanks,	Artie." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	doubt	we'll	be	gone	long.	We're	sure	to	cramp	the	kids'	style." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Or	they'll	cramp	yours." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Have	a	good	time.	Get	back	when	you	get	back." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit,	Digger,	and	I	each	called,	"Bye,	Mr.	Drake!"	He	waved	and drove	toward	the	Fountain	of	Youth. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p618"></a>The	next	three	or	four	hours	were	like	any	other	Saturday	night.	Ma counted	the	money	while	Pa	did	the	dishes,	I	swept	the	gift	shop,	and Little	Bit	swept	the	restaurant.	Saturday	was	a	bath	night,	so	we	each showered	during	a	TV	show	that	we	did	not	like.	Digger	and	I	were	in	our pajamas	and	bathrobes.	Little	Bit,	as	usual,	had	convinced	Ma	to	put	off her	bath	until	another	show	had	ended,	so	she	was	still	in	her	dusty jeans,	T-shirt,	and	tennis	shoes.	We	three	were	sitting	in	our	low chairs	at	the	foot	of	Ma	and	Pa's	bed,	watching	cowboys,	when	Ma	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	car	had	stopped	in	front	of	Dogland.	Pa	said,	"Artie	must	be	back early.	You	don't	ever	want	to	try	to	keep	up	with	teenagers."	Then	a second	car	stopped,	and	he	said,	"Guess	they	all	wore	out	early.	I'll	go look." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Be	careful." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'd	say	you	shouldn't	worry	so	much,	Susan,	if	you	didn't	seem	to thrive	on	it."	He	smiled,	bu	then	a	third	car	stopped.	Pa	looked	at	Ma, then	opened	the	closet,	took	out	the	shotgun,	and	grabbed	some	shells from	the	high	shelf	where	none	of	us	could	reach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Luke--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	probably	nothing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	bit	her	lips	and	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p619"></a>Pa	said,	"Chris,	put	on	your	boots	and	grab	the	spotlight."	Ma	reached toward	me,	and	Pa	said,	"I'll	send	him	back	if	it	looks	like	trouble.	I just	don't	want	my	hands	full." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"I'll	call	Rooster." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa,	halfway	through	the	door,	said,	"Don't	cry	wolf,"	to	her,	and	"Don't turn	that	on	unless	I	say	so,"	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	night	was	not	so	dark	that	we	could	not	see	where	we	were	going.	As we	walked,	I	could	hear	dogs	barking	to	say	they	knew	we	had	visitors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	opened	the	shotgun	to	drop	in	a	shell,	then	snapped	it	shut	and	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	there's	trouble,	run	back	to	the	house	as	fast	as	you	can." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	right,	Pa." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	shadow	of	the	privacy	fence	made	the	world	disappear,	but	the	path's familiar	ruts	would	have	guided	our	feet,	even	if	we	had	not	walked	it every	day	for	several	years.	Pa	headed	around	the	side	of	the restaurant,	and	I	followed	with	the	big	flashlight	in	both	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	fourth	vehicle	pulled	in	as	we	approached	the	front.	Pa	kept	the shotgun	in	one	hand,	pointed	at	the	ground,	like	at	the	beginning	of	the Rifleman,	but	I	did	not	think	that	then.	I	was	afraid,	but	I	was	used	to that,	and	I	was	more	afraid	of	having	to	run	back	to	the	house	alone	in the	dark	if	something	went	wrong	than	I	was	of	what	might	go	wrong	and what	that	might	mean. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p620"></a>Three	cars	and	a	pick-up	truck	had	pulled	in	from	both	driveways	and stopped	in	a	half-circle	twenty	or	thirty	feet	away	from	the	restaurant and	the	gift	shop.	Their	headlights	shone	on	the	Heart	Tree.	Pa	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Stay	here,"	while	I	was	still	beside	the	restaurant,	and	then,	"If	I say	to	turn	it	on,	shine	it	at	them,	not	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good."	Pa	stepped	out	from	the	porch	of	the	restaurant	with	the	shotgun close	beside	his	leg	and	called,	"You	folks	need	some	help?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	men	in	white	sheets	got	out	of	one	car,	and	Cal	Carter	yelled, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're	the	one	needing	help,	nigger-lover!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Tell	Ma	to	call	Rooster.	Run." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	ran	with	the	flashlight,	not	daring	to	turn	it	on	until	I	was	behind the	restaurant.	I	bumped	into	the	fence	as	I	rounded	the	privacy	screen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	flashlight	fell	and	went	out.	I	ran	on	without	it,	shouting,	"Ma! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma!	Call	the	sheriff,	Ma!	Call	the	sheriff!"	I	was	still	shouting	when	I rushed	through	the	front	door	and	saw	Ma	was	already	on	the	phone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	and	ran	out	again.	Ma	called	my	name	once,	and	then	she	called something	I	did	not	recognize,	and	then	I	was	out	in	the	night,	running as	hard	as	I	could,	not	toward	the	front	where	the	car	lights	burned, but	toward	the	dark	circle	of	our	dogs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	barked	louder	as	I	came	near.	I	thought	of	rattlesnakes	and	hairy</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p621"></a>spiders	as	big	as	your	fist	and	nameless	things	I	knew	were	in	the night,	but	I	also	knew	I	was	running	with	all	my	might.	My	fear	would carry	me	across	the	backs	of	a	thousand	rattlers	and	none	could	strike fast	enough	to	bite	me.	For	all	I	know,	I	did	step	on	things	in	the night	that	I	would	have	avoided	in	daylight,	but	I	never	slowed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain,	the	Norwegian	Elkhound,	barked	as	I	passed	him	by,	but	I	did not	stop	until	I	had	reached	Ranger's	cage.	I	lifted	the	latch	and	threw the	door	wide.	The	white	kuvasz,	shaggy	guardian	of	kings,	leaped	out	as I	went	to	free	Percival	the	Doberman,	the	dark	police	dog,	then	Max	the lion-killing	Rhodesian	Ridgeback,	then	Olaf	the	St.	Bernard	and	Spots the	Great	Dane,	who	were	scary	only	for	their	size,	and	then	the	Irish Wolfhound	and	the	mastiff	and	the	Rottweiler,	then	the	Bull	Terrier	who killed	in	pits	to	please	gamblers	and	the	Bull	Dog	who	would	grip	and never	let	go,	not	even	if	she	was	dying,	and	then	Captain	because	he	was smart,	and	the	Malamute	and	the	Husky	who	were	Captain's	friends,	and the	ghostly	grey	Weimeraner	who	pursued	big	game	in	the	dark	woods	of Germany,	the	sleek	Vizsla	from	Hungary,	and	the	Bullmastiff	who	kept poachers	away,	and	the	Chow	and	the	Tibetan	Spaniel	who	were	lucky,	and all	the	greyhounds,	because	they	were	fast,	and	the	Saluki	for	the	same reason,	and	Bambi	the	Basenji	because	she	jumped	so	high	on	her	door wanting	out,	and	then	I	was	simply	lifting	latches	as	I	ran,	following</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p622"></a>Ranger	and	a	third	of	the	dogs	of	Dogland	to	the	front	driveway.	From the	other	side	of	the	circle,	more	dogs	joined	us	that	I	had	not	freed, the	smaller	dogs	I	had	ignored	like	the	spaniels	and	the	terriers,	the beagle,	all	the	dachshunds,	the	basset	hound,	and	even	three-legged Pirate,	the	dogs	who	would	dash	into	holes	to	fight	clawed	things	in their	lair,	who	would	encircle	bears,	be	batted	away,	and	return	to	the fight	though	their	bones	had	been	broken.	Little	Bit	ran	behind	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neither	of	us	had	breath	to	speak,	or	time,	or	inclination.	Ahead	of	us, near	the	highway,	something	was	burning. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p623"></a>When	I	had	run	into	our	house	shouting	for	Ma	to	call	the	sheriff,	she had	already	dialed	and	a	deputy	had	just	answered.	When	I	ran	out	and	Ma called	my	name,	Little	Bit	had	said,	"I'll	get	him!"	and	followed	me.	Ma had	called	"Letitia!"	and	run	to	the	door,	but	when	she	saw	we	were going	toward	the	dogs	instead	of	the	front,	she	had	made	a	decision	of the	kind	that	everyone	must	make	sometime.	Hoping	she	was	right,	she	had returned	to	the	phone	to	say	where	help	should	come,	and	why.	Little	Bit had	followed	me,	but	she	never	spoke,	perhaps	because	she	wanted	to	see if	she	could	catch	me,	perhaps	because	she	wanted	to	see	where	I	was going.	When	she	saw	me	release	Ranger,	she	ran	to	free	the	dogs	further along	the	circle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Ma	finished	talking	with	the	deputy,	I	am	sure	she	bit	her	lip	and looked	once	around	the	bedroom,	but	I	doubt	she	looked	more	than	twice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	she	ran	to	Digger	and	carried	him	through	the	bathroom	into	the kids'	room.	She	certainly	said	something	like,	"Be	a	good	boy	and	stay in	bed,	okay?"	and	she	probably	kissed	him	in	the	shallow	indentation just	above	his	eyes	while	she	wrapped	one	or	both	arms	around	his	head, pressing	his	bristly	crewcut	between	her	forearms.	And	then,	I	suspect, she	said,	"Mommy	loves	you,"	and	ran	toward	the	front	drive. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p624"></a>In	the	parking	area	in	front	of	Dogland,	after	I	had	turned	and	run	back to	the	house,	Pa	had	called,	"You're	trespassing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	laughed	from	behind	the	Heart	Tree.	As	that	sheet-clad	figure stepped	out	from	the	tree's	shadow,	the	other	men	had	begun	to	laugh, too.	More	car	doors	opened,	and	fourteen	or	fifteen	men,	perhaps	half	in white	sheets	and	half	in	street	clothes,	stepped	out	of	the	vehicles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	stood	near	their	cars,	waiting	to	see	what	Pa	would	do.	Two	of	the nearest	men	carried	gas	cans,	and	six	or	seven	held	bats	or	axe	handles, and	the	rest	were	half-hidden	by	the	cars	and	the	truck	and	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"The	law's	on	my	side." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	said,	"Ol'	Rooster?"	and	they	began	to	laugh	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	brought	the	butt	of	the	shotgun	to	his	shoulder,	aimed	it	at	the center	of	the	nearest	man's	chest,	and	said,	"I	can	drop	as	many	of	you as	I	can	shoot,	and	the	law	won't	hold	it	against	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	the	vehicles,	someone	cocked	a	rifle.	One	of	the	Lawson	brothers said,	"You	don't	want	to	turn	this	into	a	shooting	matter." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"I	don't	want	to	turn	this	into	anything.	But	I'll	protect what's	mine." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	can't	shoot	all	of	us." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"True.	But	I	can	shoot	the	son-of-a-bitch	in	front	of	me.	You	could	put</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p625"></a>a	bullet	in	my	heart	right	now,	and	it	wouldn't	stop	my	finger	from squeezing.	Who	the	hell	are	you	in	that	sheet,	anyway?	You	better	hope to	God	you're	somebody	the	rest	of	them	cares	about,	or	we're	both	going to	hell	in	fifteen	seconds." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	John	Hawkins	said,	"Now,	hold	on,	Luke.	Boys,	you	hold	on,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sure,	I	don't	mind	taking	my	hood	off.	You	mind	if	I	do?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Be	my	guest." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	John	dragged	the	hood	off,	then	grinned	at	Pa.	"You	don't	mean to	shoot	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'd	say	I	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	John	shook	his	head.	"I	admit,	this	wasn't	how	I	thought	it'd play	out,	but	you	know	and	I	know	one	of	us	has	to	back	down,	and	it	has to	be	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who's	got	a	gun	with	a	real	touchy	trigger	aimed	at	who?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	can't	kill	me,	Luke.	If	you	were	stupid,	I'd	be	worried." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	get	pretty	goddamn	stupid	sometimes.	The	madder	I	get,	the	stupider	I get,	and	you	piss	me	off	so	bad	I	can't	see	straight.	But	I	don't	need to	see	straight,	'cause	this	is	loaded	with	buckshot.	So	turn	around	and get	the	hell	out	of	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sorry."	Captain	John	shook	his	head	again.	"But	you	ain't	thinking about	how	it	is.	If	the	Klan	burns	you	down,	you	and	your	family	can</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p626"></a>move	on	in	peace.	Hell,	you	can	feel	good	about	yourself,	'cause	you'll know	you	wasn't	driven	out	easy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did	I	mention	my	finger	gets	a	twitch	sometimes?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	got	four	reasons	to	ease	off	that	trigger." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	got	one	to	get	going." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Susan,	Chris,	Little	Bit,	and	Digger.	The	boys	can	afford	to	have witnesses	to	a	burning.	Ain't	no	local	jury	that'd	convict	us	on	the word	of	Yankee	trouble-makers,	not	even	if	you	had	Polaroids	of	the fires	being	lit.	But	killing	draws	too	much	attention.	It	leaves	no	room for	witnesses."	Captain	John,	holding	Pa's	gaze,	began	walking	toward the	shotgun.	"You	go	ahead	and	shoot	if	it'll	make	you	feel	good.	But	if you	give	a	goddamn	about	anything	besides	your	pride,	you'll	put	that gun	down,	go	back	to	your	house,	and	pretend	you	never	heard	a	sound	up here	till	it	was	way	too	late."	His	final	step	brought	his	chest	against the	gun	barrel.	He	waited,	then	lifted	his	hand	and	pushed	the	barrel	aside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	at	the	shotgun,	then	opened	it	and	tossed	it	aside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	John	said,	"I	thought	so." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal	Carter	exhaled	loudly	and	said,	"I	didn't	think	he	was	bluffing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	John	said,	"He	wasn't	bluffing.	He	just	hadn't	thought	it through."	He	turned	and	waved	his	arm.	"All	right,	boys.	Have	some	fun!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	who	had	been	near	the	Heart	Tree	threw	a	match.	The	tree's	roots</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p627"></a>and	trunk	exploded	in	flame.	The	other	men	yelped	with	triumph	and	ran toward	the	gift	shop	and	the	restaurant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	came	from	the	shadows	then.	They	all	stopped	when	she	called,	"Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawkins.	John.	Please.	Don't	do	this." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	at	her,	then	looked	at	one	man	with	a	gas	can.	Captain	John lifted	his	chin	toward	the	restaurant,	and	the	man	hurled	the	can through	the	big	front	window	that	had	survived	Hurricane	Donna. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Please.	Our	fire	insurance	was	canceled	because	they	heard	the Klan--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"Don't,	Susan." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	John	looked	at	her,	then	called,	"Leave	their	house	alone!"	He smiled	at	Pa.	"See?	Businessmen	do	have	hearts." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	started	forward,	but	Ma	grabbed	his	arm.	"Luke,	they're	buildings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	don't	matter." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	second	gas	can	went	through	the	window	in	the	door	to	the	gift	shop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	flames	on	the	heart	tree	had	reached	its	branches.	Leaves	and Spanish	moss	crackled	and	flared.	The	last	two	men	with	gas	cans	began splashing	the	walls	of	the	gift	shop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal	Carter	said,	"Ain't	a	bonfire	pretty,	Mister	Nix?"	Pa	said	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal	whirled,	driving	the	end	of	his	axe	handle	into	Pa's	stomach.	"Too high	and	mighty	to	answer	me,	nigger-lover?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p628"></a>Pa	staggered	back.	Cal	brought	the	axe	handle	like	a	baseball	bat against	Pa's	thigh,	and	Pa	fell	to	his	knees,	scooping	gravel	in	his hands.	But	before	he	could	throw	any,	Ma	stepped	between	them,	saying, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Cal,	please,	if	you've	got	any	feeling--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	John	was	on	the	porch	of	the	restaurant,	pulling	a	cigarette lighter	from	his	pocket.	He	looked	over	his	shoulder	and	said,	"Cal,	lay off--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal	raised	the	axe	handle	high,	to	hit	Ma	or	Pa,	or	simply	to	tell everyone	he	had	the	stage.	"You	don't	tell	me--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	one	of	the	Lawson	brothers	said,	"What	the	hell's	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Which	was	when	everyone	realized	that	the	sounds	of	fire	consuming	the Heart	Tree	had	been	buried	beneath	the	baying	of	the	dogs,	which	not only	grew	louder,	but	nearer. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p629"></a>Little	Bit	and	I	rounded	the	restaurant	in	time	to	see	the	white	kuvasz, the	black	Doberman,	and	the	gray	Wolfhound	leaping	from	the	darkness into	the	hard,	flickering	firelight.	We	could	not	see	that	they	were leaping	over	Pa,	or	that	Percy	struck	Cal	Carter's	chest,	knocking	him back	on	the	gravel,	then	baring	his	teeth	within	inches	of	the	man's	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	John	and	most	of	his	men	ran	forward	to	help	Cal,	but	several	of them	backed	away.	They	all	stopped	when	Ranger	halted,	facing	Captain John.	Bridget	the	Wolfhound,	taller,	leaner,	and	perhaps	more intimidating	than	Ranger,	stood	next	to	him,	and	Percy	stayed	on	Cal's chest.	At	least	one	man	by	the	pick-up	raised	a	rifle,	looking	for	a clear	shot	at	Percy,	then	glanced	over	his	shoulder	as	Max	the	Ridgeback and	Bubba	the	mastiff	circled	the	gift	shop	with	more	dogs	behind	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	shadows	around	the	burning	tree	surged	with	the	arrival	of	the	pack, who	waited	near	the	edge	of	the	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eight	or	ten	dogs	surrounded	Ma	and	Pa.	Pa	pushed	away	Pirate,	who nuzzled	him,	stood	with	Ma's	help,	and	called,	"If	anyone	shoots,	I won't	be	able	to	hold	'em	back." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal	was	repeating	in	a	quiet	voice	that	was	almost	sane,	"This	dog's crazy.	Get	'im	off'	o'	me.	Please,	just	get	'im	off	now,	all	right, please,	somebody?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p630"></a>Pa	said,	"I	don't	know	if	any	of	these	dogs	ever	killed	their	own	food, but	now's	as	good	a	time	as	any	to	find	out.	Unless	you'd	care	to	be going."	He	pointed	at	Captain	John.	"Just	put	that	lighter	back	in	your pocket."	Captain	John	did	not	move.	Pa	bent	over,	holding	his	side	with his	left	hand,	and	grunted	as	he	picked	up	the	axe	handle	that	Cal Carter	had	dropped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"Luke--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shook	his	head	and,	using	the	axe	handle	as	a	cane,	walked	toward Captain	John.	He	said,	"Don't	make	it	worse	for	yourself,"	then	lifted the	axe	handle	to	point	to	the	highway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	and	Seth	and	Simmy	and	Abraham	Brown	and	five	or	ten	other	dark figures	stood	on	the	shoulder	of	the	road	with	shotguns,	hoes,	and pitchforks	in	their	hands.	And	as	the	first	drop	of	rain	struck	my cheek,	two	more	cars	arrived.	Stepping	from	one,	Mrs.	DeLyon	called,	"We all	see	you,	John	Hawkins.	There's	nothing	more	you	can	do	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	John	watched	as	the	people	on	the	rise	walked	down	the	slope where	I	always	ran	from	the	bus	at	the	end	of	the	day.	Only	Mr.	Drake, Johnny	Tepes,	Mrs.	DeLyon,	and	Gwenny	Drake	came	with	empty	hands.	The rain	began	falling	in	heavier	drops,	and	then	lightning	tattooed	the eastern	horizon,	and	I	heard	thunder	as	loud	as	any	cannon	blast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	John	looked	at	Pa.	"We'll	go." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p631"></a>"No."	Pa	pointed	the	tip	of	the	axe	handle	toward	the	Lawson	brothers and	the	other	men.	"They'll	go.	You	and	Cal	can	wait	here	for	Rooster." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	wasn't	the	offer." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	guess	you	should've	taken	it	before	it	expired." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	John	smiled.	"That's	so." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal,	still	on	the	ground	with	Percy	on	his	chest,	said,	"Let	me	go	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">'em." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	shook	his	head.	"You'll	be	a	whole	lot	safer	inside	a	cell	where	I can't	get	at	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	order	of	events	blurs	after	that.	The	rain	fell	harder.	Two	cars	and a	pick-up	truck	drove	away	with	Captain	John's	followers.	Most	of	us moved	under	the	over-hang	of	the	restaurant.	The	air	smelled	of	ozone and	gasoline	and	burning	wood.	Someone	brought	hoses	from	the	dog	pens and	connected	them	to	the	faucets	at	the	back	of	the	gift	shop	and	the restaurant,	Ethorne	and	Abraham	Brown	helped	the	rain	wash	away	the gasoline	and	ensure	that	the	walls	closest	to	the	Heart	Tree	were soaked.	Mr.	Drake	and	Simmy	dug	shallow	trenches	so	the	gas	washed	away from	the	fire	and	not	toward	it.	Ma	got	us	all	raincoats	and flashlights,	and	Seth	and	Little	Bit	and	I	rounded	up	the	dogs	and returned	them	to	their	cages.	Only	ten	or	fifteen	had	run	away,	and	Seth said	they'd	probably	return	soon.	Sheriff	Donati	arrived	to	take	custody</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p632"></a>of	Cal	Carter	and	John	Hawkins,	and	Dickison's	volunteer	fire	department showed	up	shortly	after	that.	Between	the	fire	truck's	hoses	and	the rain,	the	fire	on	the	Heart	Tree	was	soon	out,	though	the	tree	was	so charred	that	Pa	told	Ethorne	it	would	have	to	come	down	the	next	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	the	fire	department	left,	Ma	decided	Pa	should	have	Doctor	Lamont look	him	over,	and	after	he	protested,	he	agreed.	Mr.	Drake	said	he could	see	that	Little	Bit	and	I	got	to	bed,	so	Pa	eased	himself	into	the passenger	seat	of	our	station	wagon,	and	Ma	took	the	wheel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	rested	his	hand	on	my	shoulder	and	said,	"That	was	a	little excessive,	son,	but	you	did	good,"	and	I	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"I	helped." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"You	helped	good." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	said,	"Why'd	you	let	them	men	go?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said,	"The	world's	full	of	followers.	It's	the	leaders	you	got	to look	out	for." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ma	said,	"We'll	be	back	as	soon	as	we	can.	Don't	wait	up!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	looked	at	me.	"Well,	Mark	Christopher,	I	guess	you're	in	charge	till we	return." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded,	and	Mr.	Drake,	standing	near,	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	plywood	had	been	nailed	over	the	two	broken	windows	and	the shattered	glass	had	been	swept	into	a	pile,	Ethorne	and	Mr.	Drake	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p633"></a>Mrs.	DeLyon	concluded	that	whatever	was	left	should	wait	until	morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simmy,	Abraham	Brown,	and	the	others	waved	and	went	away.	Seth	said	he thought	he'd	see	if	one	or	both	of	the	Newbury	girls	was	awake	and interested	in	the	story	of	the	fire,	and	he	left,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake,	Mrs.	DeLyon,	Gwenny,	Johnny	Tepes,	Ethorne,	Little	Bit,	and	I went	back	to	the	trailer	for	a	snack.	While	Gwenny	and	Johnny	Tepes	made cheese	sandwiches,	Little	Bit	fell	asleep	on	the	couch,	and	one	of	two things	happened.	Either	Mr.	Drake	and	Mrs.	DeLyon	carried	Little	Bit into	the	bedroom,	saying	they'd	look	in	on	Digger,	or	I	also	fell asleep,	and	what	follows	is	the	second	dream	that	I	still	remember. </p>
<div class="calibre3"></div><h2 title="Chapter Twelve, Peace on Earth" id="calibre_toc_15" class="calibre4">Chapter	Twelve</h2>
<h3 class="sigilnotintoc">Peace	on	Earth</h3>

<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	hurried	into	the	trailer,	and	Ethorne,	Gwenny,	Johnny	Tepes, and	I	looked	up	as	Mrs.	DeLyon	followed	him.	He	looked	at	me.	"Where would	Digger	go?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged	and	blinked.	The	question	made	no	sense;	Digger	would	not	go anywhere.	When	he	slept,	he	slept	for	ten	hours.	You	could	toss	him around	like	a	sack	of	potatoes,	and	he	would	not	wake	up.	With	one exception.	"Bathroom?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	shook	her	head.	"No." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"And	he's	not	in	any	of	the	beds.	We	looked	in	all	three." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p634"></a>Mrs.	DeLyon	said,	"And	under	them.	And	I	called	for	him.	He	wouldn't hide	from	me,	would	he?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head.	Ethorne	got	up,	went	to	the	door,	and	shouted,	"Digger! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where	is	you,	Digger-boy?	You	don't	need	to	hide	no	more.	Everything's fine	now!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	dogs	barked	in	response,	but	no	person	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	said,	"Call	Dr.	Lamont.	Maybe	Susan	put	him	in	the	backseat and	forgot	to	tell	us." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake's	voice	held	as	little	hope	for	that	as	Mrs.	DeLyon's,	but	he said,	"All	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	said,	"We'll	get	Chris	to	bed	in	the	meantime." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	in	charge,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"When	there's	nothing	you	can	do,	you	might	as	well	sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Save	your	strength	for	when	you	need	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	said,	"Don't	worry.	At	least	one	of	us	will	stay	in	the trailer	until	your	folks	get	back." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gwenny	said,	"C'mon,	boyfriend.	I'll	see	you	to	your	bed." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"I	can	go	by	myself." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gwenny	looked	at	Mrs.	DeLyon,	then	at	Johnny	Tepes.	"Well,	that's	a	blow to	a	girl's	ego." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	smiled	without	much	humor,	and	Mr.	Drake	hung	up	the	phone. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p635"></a>Ethorne	said,	"What	is	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"Let's	get	Chris	to	bed	first." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stood	and	went	to	the	door.	"G'night." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gwenny	started	to	follow,	but	Mrs.	Drake	caught	her	arm.	"It's	his decision." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	rain	had	stopped	by	then.	I	stepped	into	the	porch	light	as	everyone called	or	waved	to	me,	and	I	ran	to	the	door	into	our	room.	I	turned	off the	porch	light	and	stepped	inside.	In	the	glow	of	a	nightlight,	Little Bit	slept	soundly.	I	went	into	the	bathroom,	through	the	door	into	Ma and	Pa's	room,	out	their	front	door,	and	back	into	the	night.	As	I tiptoed	through	the	wet	grass	toward	the	trailer,	I	heard	a	piece	of their	discussion:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why	couldn't	Rooster	hang	onto	him?"	asked	Gwenny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Someone's	got	to	stay,"	said	Mrs.	DeLyon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	matters	now	is	who's	got	the	fastest	car,"	said	Ethorne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	d'you	know	he's	there?"	said	Gwenny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't,"	said	Mrs.	DeLyon.	"I	hope	he's	sleeping	in	one	of	the	dog houses	with	his	favorite	dog.	Someone	should	check	them	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	that	while	we're	gone,"	said	Mr.	Drake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	don't	know	what	you're	getting	into,"	said	Mrs.	DeLyon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	do,"	said	Ethorne. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p636"></a>"Who	stays	may	be	more	important	than	who	goes,"	said	Mr.	Drake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've	got	the	fastest	car,"	said	Johnny	Tepes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned,	tiptoed	to	the	path,	then	ran	on	drying	mud	to	the	parking area.	As	I	went	through	the	passway,	I	heard	the	trailer	door	open,	and I	hurried	on,	wishing	for	the	first	time	in	my	life	that	I	was	wearing sneakers	instead	of	cowboy	boots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only	tourists	locked	their	cars	in	Latchahie	County	in	1962.	I	opened Johnny	Tepes'	door,	scrambled	into	the	back,	and	folded	myself	into	a ball	in	the	foot	well	behind	the	driver's	seat.	A	leather	motorcycle jacket	lay	on	the	rear	cushion,	so	I	dragged	it	over	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	opened	the	driver's	door	and	got	in.	As	the	engine	started,	the passenger	door	opened,	the	passenger	seat	folded	down,	and	someone leaped	into	the	back,	hitting	me	with	an	elbow	or	a	knee.	The	seat folded	up,	and	the	car	accelerated	in	reverse	before	the	third	person had	a	chance	to	slam	the	door	shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"This	thing	got	seat	belts?	I'll	use	mine." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	brakes	caught,	and	I	was	slammed	into	the	back	of	the	driver's	seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gravel	spun	as	Johnny	Tepes	popped	the	clutch	into	first,	and	I	rocked into	the	side	of	the	backseat	as	we	hurtled	up	the	driveway	and,	still accelerating,	onto	the	highway.	If	I	had	not	been	thinking	about	Digger, I	would	thought	it	was	better	than	any	carnival	ride. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p637"></a>Mr.	Drake	said,	"You	have	been	driving	for	awhile?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	engine	roared	as	Johnny	Tepes	downshifted.	The	car	slowed, fishtailed,	then	charged	from	pavement	onto	gravel	as	Johnny	Tepes ratcheted	back	up	through	the	gears.	Though	I	had	never	traveled	the route	so	quickly,	the	direction	of	the	turn	and	the	sound	of	the	road told	me	we	were	on	the	old	county	road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shifting	into	the	fourth	and	highest	gear,	Johnny	Tepes	said,	"A	few	years." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	we	drove.	I	can't	say	how	long.	In	my	memory	of	the	dream,	we	drove forever.	I	may	have	fallen	asleep.	I	knew	the	road	to	Dickison,	but	it seemed	we	quickly	passed	that	turn-off.	The	road	grew	rougher	and bumpier,	but	you	adjust	to	everything.	The	carpeting	beneath	me	was	new, and	though	the	car	swayed,	it	rarely	veered	abruptly.	Johnny	Tepes seemed	to	see	further	than	his	headlights	to	anticipate	every	obstacle ahead	of	us.	I	might	have	fallen	asleep	in	my	dream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometime	in	that	timeless	time,	Mr.	Drake	said,	"What've	you	got	back here,	anyway?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	Tepes	said,	"Back	where?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	jacket	rose	from	my	head.	Mr.	Drake	and	I	looked	at	each	other.	Then he	set	the	jacket	aside	and	said,	"We	got	a	stowaway." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Chris,	why'd	you	hide	back	there?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	Tepes	said,	"Because	you	wouldn't	let	him	come	if	he'd	asked." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p638"></a>I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"That	ain't	what	I	was	asking." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	my	brother,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,"	said	Ethorne.	"It's	a	curse	to	have	answers	good	enough	to	help you	into	trouble." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"Chris,	if	we	left	you	by	the	road	with	a	flashlight, would	you	be	all	right	till	we	got	back?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	I	could	answer,	Johnny	Tepes	said,	"No,"	and	Ethorne	said,	"We gone	too	far	for	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	nodded.	"You	might	as	well	sit	up	on	the	seat.	If	anyone's going	to	punish	you,	it'll	be	your	folks." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Or	life,"	said	Johnny	Tepes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bench	seat	was	more	comfortable	than	the	floor,	but	the	windows	did not	give	me	much	more	information	than	I	had	had	with	a	jacket	over	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	thought	the	stars	were	coming	out	after	the	rain,	but	the	only light	I	could	see	came	from	the	headlights	and	the	dashboard.	The	road ahead	was	gray,	rutted,	and	littered	with	rocks.	What	trees	we	could	see were	stunted	and	misshapen	in	that	light.	Shortly	after	I	sat	up,	I noticed	one	sign,	"Dead	End,"	and	no	others.	The	motion	of	the headlights	suggested	that	things	moved	around	us	in	the	darkness.	Once something	pale	passed	by,	and	I	thought	of	Handyman's	tale	of	the	white</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p639"></a>boar,	but	nothing	showed	itself	clearly.	If	there	were	any	sounds,	the car	engine	smothered	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	car	slowed,	I	sat	up.	A	pole	had	been	set	across	the	road	on two	rests	to	stop	travelers.	Beyond	it,	a	wooden	platform	jutted	into	a thick,	swirling	mist.	An	oil	lamp	burned	at	each	end	of	the	platform, showing	what	I've	described,	and	nothing	else.	I	said,	"Are	we	here?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"We	aren't	where	we're	going." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	we	walk?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"We'll	find	out." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"I'll	find	out,"	got	out,	and	called,	"Hello?	Is	anybody here?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	the	darkness,	someone	called,	"Go	back!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	yelled,	"We	got	business	on	the	other	side." </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	old	man	and	a	large,	ugly	dog	that	looked	like	a	mix	of	mastiff, Bulldog,	and	Bloodhound	stepped	into	the	headlights.	The	man	said,	"They got	business	with	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Did	a	man	and	a	boy	come	by	in	the	last	hour	or	so?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	stroked	his	beard,	looked	at	the	dog,	then	back	at	Ethorne	and nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Then	we	got	business." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This	ain't	no	charity	operation." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p640"></a>"We'll	pay." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah.	Question	is,	how	much?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What'll	it	take?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	you	got." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	to	get	back?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	little	bit	more." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	looked	at	the	car.	Johnny	Tepes	said,	"Sure,"	and	Mr.	Drake said,	"If	it's	what	we	have	to	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Can	the	boy	stay	here?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Boy	can	stay	anywhere." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Will	he	be	safe?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This	ain't	no	baby-sitting	service	neither." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"I	want	to	go." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"We'll	be	coming	back	soon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"I	got	to	go."	I	leaned	across	Mr.	Drake	to	thrust	my	fist	out the	window.	"Look.	I	can	pay." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	old	man	took	the	coin	that	the	day's	last	tourists	had	given	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	can	go." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"And	come	back?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	old	man	nodded.	"And	come	back.	If	he	wants." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	pulled	wadded	bills	and	coins	from	his	front	pockets	to	give</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p641"></a>them	to	the	man.	Mr.	Drake	took	a	silver	clip	holding	several	folded bills	and	gave	that,	too.	Johnny	Tepes	spun	something	toward	the	old man,	and	when	he	caught	it,	he	grinned	and	said,	"Billfold	too?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	Tepes	shrugged.	"You	said	everything." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,"	said	the	old	man,	"let's	get	going.	You	could	catch	your	death in	this	damp."	He	lifted	the	pole	from	its	rests,	then	carried	it	onto the	wooden	platform.	The	dog	walked	at	his	side.	Ethorne	got	back	into the	car,	we	drove	onto	the	platform,	the	old	man	untied	two	cables	at the	rear	of	the	platform,	and,	using	the	pole,	pushed	us	out	into	the	river. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"Can	I	get	out?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	looked	at	me,	then	laughed.	"We	paid	for	the	trip.	We	might	as well	enjoy	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	we	all	got	out	of	the	car.	The	lamp	showed	dark	water	around	us,	but when	I	looked	over	the	sides,	I	could	not	see	my	reflection,	or	even	the ripple	of	our	passing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"What	do	you	think?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	Tepes	said,	"I've	seen	it	before." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	asked	Ethorne,	"Digger's	all	right,	isn't	he?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"I'm	sure	he	is." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	walked	back	by	the	old	man.	His	dog,	sitting	beside	him,	looked	past me.	He	was	the	biggest	and	ugliest	dog	I	had	ever	seen,	and	I	saw</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p642"></a>nothing	in	his	glassy	eyes.	If	his	tail	had	wagged,	I	might	have	been able	to	tell	if	he	was	feeling	friendly	or	afraid,	but	it	was	still	on the	deck,	curled	beside	him	with	no	more	life	than	a	rope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	held	out	my	hand,	palm	up,	and	waited.	The	old	man	glanced	at	me,	but the	dog	did	not	move,	so	I	stepped	closer,	keeping	my	hand	before	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	touched	his	muzzle,	it	was	cold.	I	said,	"Good	boy,"	and	stroked his	head	once,	then	said,	"That's	a	good	boy,"	again,	and	scratched	him behind	the	ears	where	Ranger	and	Captain	liked	being	scratched.	His	head swung	to	regard	me,	and	his	breath	was	warm	on	my	arm	just	before	he licked	my	wrist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"He's	a	good	dog.	What's	his	name?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	old	man	pushed	again	with	the	pole.	"I	doubt	he	remembers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	you	remember?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	old	man	looked	down	at	me.	"What	do	you	think	his	name	should	be?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"George." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mmm,"	the	old	man	said,	and	the	dog	licked	my	wrist	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	we	reached	the	far	shore,	Johnny	Tepes	drove	us	onto	land,	but	he stopped	almost	as	soon	as	the	river	was	lost	in	the	night.	Ethorne	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	is	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	feel	so	good." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"What	do	you	mean?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p643"></a>"I	feel	weak." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Weak?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hungry.	Someone	else	better	drive." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	didn't	bring	anything	to	eat." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	can	hold	out." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"All	right.	I'll	drive." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	car	stopped,	and	the	two	men	crossed	in	the	headlights,	then	got back	in,	and	we	drove	on.	I	could	no	longer	see	the	shadows	of	trees	to either	side	of	us,	and	I	wondered	if	we	were	getting	close	to	the	sea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	road	ended	at	a	construction	camp.	One	bright	lamp	on	top	of	a	tall pole	showed	metal	trailers,	trucks,	bulldozers,	and	steam	shovels arranged	in	a	ring.	The	only	vehicles	that	seemed	out	of	place	were Captain	John's	car	and	Nick	Lumiere's	white	convertible,	parked	at	the center	of	the	circle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	let	off	the	gas	and	the	car	slowed	of	its	own	accord.	When	we were	beside	the	other	two	vehicles,	he	touched	the	brake	lightly,	and	we stopped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	Tepes	looked	at	Ethorne	and	Mr.	Drake.	Mr.	Drake	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"I	think	we	could	be	hunting	around	here	for	a	mighty	long time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	Tepes	reached	over	to	put	his	hand	on	the	horn	and	hold	it	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p644"></a>At	almost	any	other	time,	I	would	have	loved	the	loud,	long	cry,	but here	it	was	only	a	noise	that	cut	into	the	darkness,	and	the	darkness ignored	it.	Ethorne	shook	his	head.	Johnny	Tepes	took	his	palm	off	the horn	and	fell	back	in	the	passenger	seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	stepped	out	of	the	car.	He	looked	into	the	shadows,	and	at	the trailers.	Electric	lights	burned	in	each	of	them,	but	nothing	moved inside	any.	Ethorne	cupped	his	hands	around	his	mouth	and	yelled,	"We're here	to	make	a	deal!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	of	the	nearest	trailer	opened.	Nick	Lumiere	said,	"Yes?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You've	got	Digger?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Lumiere	shook	his	head.	The	light	behind	him	was	so	bright	that	I could	not	make	out	details	inside	the	trailer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Then	we	can't	make	a	deal,"	and	turned	toward	the	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Lumiere	said,	"John	Hawkins	has	Digger." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	John	stepped	into	the	doorway	behind	him	and	said,	"You	didn't have	to	tell	'em	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	have	to	do	anything	at	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	thought	you	and	me	had	a	deal." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	and	I	were	negotiating	a	deal.	Now	we	got	a	few	more	bidders." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	I	brought	the	boy!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Lumiere	nodded.	"Doesn't	give	you	any	more	right	to	him	than	they	have." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p645"></a>Ethorne	said,	"Where's	Digger	at?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Lumiere	turned,	looked	past	Captain	John,	and	held	out	his	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	came	from	the	bright	room	and	took	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Hey,	Digger.	You	all	right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	nodded	and	said,	"Where's	Ma	and	Pa?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"They're	waiting	for	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Lumiere	and	Digger	walked	down	the	steps	and	onto	the	dirt.	Captain John	followed.	Mr.	Lumiere	released	Digger's	hand,	and	Digger	walked over	to	Ethorne,	who	squatted	to	hug	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"You're	letting	him	go?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	John	said,	"Like	hell!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Lumiere	laughed.	A	steam	roller	started	up	behind	us.	As	we	turned to	look,	it	rolled	across	the	road	and	stopped,	trapping	us	all	in	the camp.	Someone	was	sitting	at	its	wheel.	Someone	was	sitting	at	the	wheel of	every	machine	around	us.	In	their	hardhats	under	the	harsh	overhead light,	at	that	distance,	they	might	as	well	have	been	faceless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Lumiere	looked	into	the	car.	"Hello,	Johnny.	Long	time,	no	see." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	Tepes	said,	"Not	long	enough." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're	looking	a	tad	peaked.	Want	to	come	back	to	work	for	me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	Tepes	shook	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	don't	miss	that	feeling	of	power?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p646"></a>Johnny	Tepes	nodded.	"I	plan	to	keep	on	missing	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Lumiere	smiled.	"How're	you,	Artie?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"I'm	not	here	to	play	games." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	that's	why	I'm	here.	So,	how's	your	love	life?	I	hope	there's	no one	in	your	way.	Maybe	you	need	a	word	in	the	right	place	to	get	a	good job	in	the	agency?	I	only	want	to	help." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	want	Digger	back." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	might	not'a'	had	to	come	out	for	that.	John	Hawkins	there	wants	the tree	and	the	springs.	If	he	negotiates	with	the	Nixes,	Digger'll	be	back with	his	family.	Would	that	be	acceptable	to	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	do	you	mean,	if?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	I	might	arrange	for	John	Hawkins	to	get	his	desire	some	other way.	Digger's	a	good	kid.	I've	always	wanted	a	son." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	stared.	"You	couldn't." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Lumiere	smiled.	"I	do	have	my	means,	Artie.	I	could,	and	I	very	well might."	He	looked	past	Mr.	Drake.	"Hi,	Chris.	Would	you	like	it	if	I adopted	your	brother?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	don't	ever	get	jealous?	Everyone	spoils	him,	and	that's	hardly	fair." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	get	jealous	for	long." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	would	you	trade	him	for? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p647"></a>I	thought.	Things	that	I	wanted	presented	themselves	to	me,	and	finally I	said,	"Everything." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Everything?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Everything	in	the	whole	wide	world." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We're	talking,	oh,	ruling	the	world?	As	a	king,	say?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hardly	original." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	it	has	its	appeal.	And	I'd	get	your	brother?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head.	"You'd	get	the	world.	I'd	get	Digger." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well.	That's	touching.	Don't	you	think,	Ethorne?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	what	do	you	want	from	life?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	trade." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Which	is?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Me	for	Digger." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Lumiere	laughed.	"Why	would	I	do	that?	You're	a	little	too	old	to shape	as	my	son." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Cause	you	can	have	me	now,	and	it	ain't	likely	you'll	get	another chance.	You	been	asking	me	to	join	up	with	you	for	a	powerful	long	time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	so." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p648"></a>"And	you	can	always	get	another	shot	at	Digger." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	must	think	I'm	awfully	patient." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	ain't	nobody	more	patient	than	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"Hold	on,	Ethorne.	That	doesn't	help	things." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	nodded.	"Sure	it	does.	I	had	me	plenty	of	time.	If	I	can	give somebody	else	a	little,	what	more	is	there?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"You	can't	do	this,	Ethorne." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	Tepes	said,	"Looks	like	he's	doing	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	"You're	going	to	work	for	Mr.	Lumiere,	Ethorne?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	'xpect	he'll	find	something	for	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	won't	miss	Dogland?	Or	Seth	and	James	and	Francy?	Or	us?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	I'll	miss	all	that.	But	I'll	feel	pretty	good	knowing	it's	all still	going	on."	He	looked	at	Mr.	Lumiere.	"If	we	got	a	deal." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Lumiere	said,	"There'll	be	consequences." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Always	are." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Lumiere	lifted	a	hand	toward	the	road.	The	steam	roller	backed	away, opening	a	space	wide	enough	for	our	car.	"We	got	a	deal." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	John	said,	"Hey!	What	about	me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Lumiere	smiled.	"Oh,	I'll	find	something	for	you,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	began	to	cry.	Ethorne	squatted	beside	him	and	hugged	him.	When Ethorne	stood,	he	walked	Digger	to	the	car,	held	their	clasped	hands</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p649"></a>toward	Mr.	Drake,	then	used	his	free	hand	to	loosen	Digger's	fingers.	He put	Digger's	hand	in	Mr.	Drake's,	and	Mr.	Drake	picked	Digger	up	and held	him	tight	like	he	was	two	years	younger	and	still	a	baby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Digger	said,	"I	love	you,	Ethorne." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	nodded.	"I	know	you	do,	child.	I	love	you,	too."	He	looked	at me.	"You	too	old	to	give	me	a	hug?"	I	shook	my	head.	"Then	come	on	over here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	got	out	of	the	car	and	walked	to	Ethorne.	He	said,	"You	take	good	care of	your	little	brother."	I	nodded.	His	eyes	had	watered,	but	he	was smiling.	He	said,	"Give	me	a	hug,	now."	I	nodded	again,	and	he	stooped down.	His	cheek	was	bristly	against	mine,	and	he	smelled	of	smoke	and earth	and	hard	work.	He	whispered,	"Nick	won't	figure	it	out	for	a	long time,	but	it's	all	right.	I	won." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pulled	back	to	look	at	his	face.	He	nodded	and	grinned,	then	rubbed the	top	of	my	head,	then	backed	away.	He	called,	"Hey,	Johnny,	take	it easy	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	Tepes	said,	"You,	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ethorne	said,	"Remember	me	to	everybody.	Tell	my	boys	I	got	faith	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">'em."	As	he	waved,	standing	next	to	Nick	Lumiere	and	Captain	John beneath	that	harsh	light,	we	all	got	into	the	car	and	headed	back	into the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p650"></a>Mr.	Drake	drove,	and	Johnny	Tepes	sat	in	the	passenger	seat	with	his arms	wrapped	around	his	stomach.	Digger	cried	for	awhile,	and	I	sat beside	him,	not	knowing	what	to	do.	Mr.	Drake	said,	"That's	all	right," </p>
<p class="calibre1">to	him.	His	voice	sounded	as	though	comforting	Digger	kept	him	from crying,	too.	I	put	my	arm	around	my	brother	then,	and	he	fell	asleep with	his	head	on	my	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	ferry,	the	man	and	the	dog	blocked	our	way.	The	man	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What'll	you	pay	now?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Drake	said,	"Ethorne	paid." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mmm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	dog	did	not	move.	I	stuck	my	head	and	my	arm	out	the	window	and yelled,	"George,	hey,	George,	it's	me,	remember?"	He	cocked	his	head, then	walked	to	the	side	of	the	car,	and	I	scratched	behind	his	ear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	old	man	looked	across	the	river.	"Well,	people're	waiting.	Let's	go." </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	we	returned	to	Dogland,	Gwenny	and	Mrs.	DeLyon	ran	out	to	meet	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gwenny	said,	"Hey,	Digger,	welcome	back!	Hey,	Chris,	you	little	sneak, you	had	us	no	end	of	worried."	Then	she	embraced	Johnny	Tepes	and	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	glad	you	weren't	gone	long.	Hey,	are	you	all	right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	looked	at	Mr.	Drake.	"Where's	Ethorne?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	Tepes	answered.	"A	trade." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gwenny	said,	"What?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p651"></a>"He	joined	Nick	Lumiere." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	thought	he	despised	the	man." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	said,	"People	do	the--"	She	looked	at	Digger,	swallowed,	and said,	"--most	amazing	things."	She	looked	at	Mr.	Drake,	"Luke's	got	a couple	of	broken	ribs,	and	the	doctor	wants	him	to	spend	the	night there,	but	he	and	Susan'll	be	back	shortly.	Digger	looks	exhausted." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	not,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	I	can	see	that.	Well,	maybe	you	should	go	to	the	trailer	and	wait up	for	your	folks."	She	glanced	at	Johnny	Tepes,	then	turned	to	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drake	and	said,	"I'll	be	back	in	a	couple	of	minutes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	said,	"Drive	carefully,	Maggie.	It's	been	a	hell	of	a	night." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled,	nodded,	and	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	Mr.	Drake's	trailer,	Gwenny	and	Johnny	Tepes	sat	on	the	couch	with their	heads	close	together.	I	sat	in	the	dinette	booth	with	my	back against	the	wall	and	my	feet	up,	which	Ma	always	told	me	not	to	do	and Mr.	Drake	never	told	me	not	to	do.	I	watched	him	make	tea,	and	I	wanted to	ask	him	about	a	lot	of	things,	but	I	did	not	understand	any	of	them well	enough	to	form	my	questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	returned	with	a	big	dull	metal	bowl	that	she	held	in	both hands.	I	said,	"What's	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	said,	"It's	the	liner	for	the	dipping	basin	at	the	fountain.	When</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p652"></a>I'm	in	a	hurry,	it's	the	easiest	way	to	carry	water." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	held	it	out	to	Johnny	Tepes.	He	looked	at	her.	She	nodded,	and	he put	out	his	hands,	and	she	set	the	basin	into	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gwenny	said,	"Dad's	got	a	lot	of	cups,	you	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	DeLyon	smiled.	"It's	not	the	first	time	someone's	drunk	directly from	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnny	Tepes	lifted	the	basin	and	held	it	close	to	his	chin,	as	though smelling	it,	but	I	could	see	it	was	only	water.	Then	he	put	it	to	his lips,	tipped	it,	and	drank	deeply.	When	he	was	done,	he	handed	it	back to	Mrs.	DeLyon.	"Thank	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed.	"You	kids've	been	up	so	late,	you	might	as	well	see	the	sun rise." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Me,	too?"	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No.	I	think	you've	seen	plenty	for	one	night." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p653"></a>On	Sunday,	October	28,	the	Nixes	slept	late.	Helen	arrived	early	as usual	to	feed	the	dogs,	and	since	Gwenny	and	Johnny	Tepes	had	stayed	up to	help	her,	there	was	no	unusual	barking	to	wake	us.	Five	or	six	of	the dogs	who	had	gone	missing	the	night	before	were	waiting	near	their	pens for	their	breakfast.	The	last	wanderers	were	brought	to	us	during	the next	four	days	by	people	who	found	them	all	over	Latchahie	County. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	we	finally	rose,	Little	Bit,	Digger,	and	I	were	delighted	with	the bandages	around	Pa's	chest	and	leg	because	he	looked	like	the	hero	at the	end	of	a	cowboy	movie.	In	the	restaurant	kitchen,	Ma	made	waffles, the	best	breakfast	treat	of	all,	and	Pa	announced	that	he	didn't	want people	babying	him,	and	everyone	laughed	at	that	idea.	Pa	said	he	hoped he	didn't	have	to	get	beaten	up	too	often	to	lift	everyone's	spirits, and	we	all	volunteered	for	the	job.	When	Pa	asked	Ma	why	she	hadn't raised	a	bunch	of	pacifists,	Ma	only	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sunday	was	Lurleen's	day	off,	yet	she	came	in	with	Handyman	and	Jordy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shortly	after	breakfast,	we	all	got	to	work	sweeping	and	scrubbing	and replacing	the	windows	in	the	gift	shop	and	the	front	of	the	restaurant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pa	said	a	couple	of	times	that	he	wondered	where	Ethorne	was.	Seth arrived	a	little	later	to	say	that	Ethorne	had	died	in	his	sleep	during the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p654"></a>Krushchev	accepted	a	secret	offer	from	Kennedy	that	Sunday:	The	U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">would	withdraw	its	missiles	from	Turkey	if	Russia	took	its	missiles	from Cuba	and	promised	to	keep	the	terms	of	the	agreement	a	secret	to preserve	America's	pride.	The	Nix	family	and	the	world	waited	four	more days	for	the	news.	On	November	2nd,	Kennedy	announced	that	the	missiles in	Cuba	were	being	dismantled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	and	Francy	returned	to	Dickison	for	Ethorne's	funeral.	Francy,	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drake,	Mrs.	DeLyon,	Johnny	Tepes,	Gwenny,	and	my	family	were	the	only white	people	in	the	crowded	church,	which	made	me	feel	odd.	When everyone	prayed,	I	did,	too.	I	figured	if	there	was	a	God,	he	ought	to know	to	look	after	Ethorne.	When	everyone	said	"Amen,"	Pa	said	it	too, as	loud	as	anyone	and	maybe	louder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	school,	Wayne	Lawson	asked	if	it	was	fun	to	see	a	drunk	nigger	get buried.	I	hit	him	in	the	nose,	drawing	blood,	and	he	blacked	my	eye.	We both	went	to	the	principal's	office,	but	Mr.	Hadley	didn't	paddle	either of	us.	After	that,	Wayne	Lawson	and	I	were	never	friends,	but	we	had	a truce.	I	felt	bad	about	hitting	him,	because	it	was	not	what	Ethorne would	have	wanted,	but	I	never	felt	too	bad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	never	wondered	whether	Rooster	Donati	had	let	Captain	John	go	on	his word,	or	he	had	posted	bond,	or	he	had	escaped	Saturday	night,	then	made a	deal	early	in	the	morning	with	the	sheriff	to	quiet	the	matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p655"></a>Whatever	happened,	the	criminal	proceedings	against	John	Hawkins	did	not slow	the	legal	proceedings	against	Mrs.	DeLyon.	On	November	1,	she	lost the	Fountain	of	Youth	to	the	Dickison	State	Bank	and	Captain	John. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Nix	family	went	to	the	motel	to	see	her	off.	All	her	goods	fit	into boxes	and	suitcases	in	the	back	of	a	pick-up	truck.	As	we	arrived,	she put	a	last	box	in	the	back	of	the	truck,	then	went	to	the	green	cement fountain	by	the	swimming	pool,	lifted	out	the	metal	liner	of	the	dipping basin,	and	tucked	it	into	a	box	of	pots	and	pans.	Then	she	looked	around and	said,	"Well.	I	hope	he	thinks	it	was	worth	it,"	and	we	began	the round	of	hugs	and	farewells. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	goodbyes	included	Mr.	Drake.	He	left	the	same	day,	driving	behind Mrs.	DeLyon	in	her	sports	car.	They	planned	to	leave	one	vehicle	and most	of	their	goods	in	Jacksonville	with	Gwenny	and	Johnny	Tepes,	then spend	some	time	traveling	around	the	country	or	the	world,	looking,	as Mr.	Drake	said,	for	the	next	good	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	last	thing	he	said	to	me	was,	"That	story	about	the	king	and	the queen	and	the	friend?	Don't	blame	the	queen.	Maybe	it's	better	to	love too	much	than	too	little.	And	maybe	the	king	should'a'	blessed	her	and his	friend,	and	stopped	fretting	over	the	past,	and	gotten	on	with	the future.	Who	knows?	Maybe	his	country	would've	never	fallen,	and	he might've	gotten	together	with	the	woman	who	gave	him	the	sword,	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p656"></a>whole	story	would've	ended	better	for	everyone.	Though	I	s'pose	it	might not've	been	told	so	often." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	have	another	memory	that	I	cannot	rationalize.	Perhaps	this	is	a	bit of	dream	also,	and	not	history:	Before	Mrs.	DeLyon	got	into	her	car,	I asked	her,	"What'd	Ethorne	mean	when	he	said	he	won?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	surprise,	she	did	not	look	like	Mrs.	DeLyon,	but	like	someone	very young	who	had	been	caught	on	stage	in	another	actor's	costume.	She	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"When?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	last	night." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	said	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	kissed	my	forehead.	"Thank	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	what's	it	mean?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	said	once	the	only	war	you	win	is	the	war	you	never	fight." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Never?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shrugged.	"What's	never?	But	if	you	can	keep	putting	something	off, it's	as	good	as	never." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Nix	family	drove	back	to	Dogland	in	silence.	We	parked	by	the	stump of	the	Heart	Tree.	Its	burned	bark	had	been	cut	away,	so	it	looked	like a	place	to	sit,	or	to	spread	a	cloth	for	a	picnic.	As	we	walked	past, Little	Bit	stared	at	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p657"></a>Ma	said,	"Don't	worry	about	the	squirrels	and	the	birds,	Little	Bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They'll	find	a	new	home." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Bit	shook	her	head	and	pointed.	At	the	base	of	the	tree	grew	a tiny	green	bud.	Whether	it	came	from	the	tree	itself	or	a	seed	that	had fallen,	we	did	not	know,	or	care. </p>
<p class="calibre1">--the	end</p>
