<p class="calibre1">Fisher awakened early, too hot to sleep comfortably in Lena's quarters, as usual, despite the fact that he had altered his metabolism to more closely match hers. Fisher lay awake spread-eagled in the darkness staring at the invisible mosaic on the ceiling, thinking about new approaches to take to study the star dragon. Unstructured time, he had come to appreciate recently, was a good way to solve problems. He didn't resent his sleeplessness.</p>
<pre class="calibre2"><code class="calibre3">So he was awake when Lena started gasping, then moaning. He was reaching out to her when she said, "No, Grandfather, no!" She jerked away at his touch and kicked the covers at him, breathing fast and shallow. Her big black eyes glinted faintly in the dim light.



"It's all right," he said soothingly, "Just a nightmare. That's all."



She gulped, swallowed, in the dark. "Yes," she said finally. "A nightmare."



"Want to talk about it?"



"No," she said too quickly. "But you can hold me."



"Come here," he said, pulling her into the crook of his arm. She was warm, stifling even, against his sweaty skin. He held her close.



He thought she would say something after a time, but she seemed content to huddle with him. He lifted his arm to cradle Lena's head, letting his fingers idly twist locks of her hair. Her hair was short and fine, and unwound nearly as swiftly as he wound it up. "Why don't you let your hair grow out?" he mused.



"No," she said. "I mean, I like it short."



Short, fair, all on the surface. In control. Nothing hidden or mysterious. Not very dragon-like at all. "I think it might be a good look for you. Why not try it?"
</code></pre>
<p class="calibre1">"No!" She sat up from him. "I don't want to."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Look, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were touchy about it." But he was irritated. Hair was such a small thing, a triviality, and she would not indulge him one iota. This made him begin to worry about the course developing in the dragon meetings. If Lena would not compromise with her hair, what were the chances she would compromise on more important issues? He shook the thought away. She was probably just being contrary because of her bad dream. Maybe he should find out about that. "Tell me about your nightmare, Lena."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The deep," she whispered. "Something coming up for me, a monster of some kind. It was a child's dream. It was nothing."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You mentioned your grandfather," he gently prodded.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She was silent so long he wondered if she had heard him. Just before he was about to repeat his statement she said, "I don't remember. I'm awake now. Make it morning, Papa."</p>
<p class="calibre1">And beyond the doors the sun began to rise over the ocean. Lena rose faster and was into the bathroom at once.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fisher lay back onto the soft bed and stared at the now blue mosaic. The octopus's tentacles twisted around the water, grasping nothing despite the visibility. He had tried. But they just weren't going to be that way it seemed. Not yet. Maybe not ever. Because he had hoped so, he hurt.</p>
