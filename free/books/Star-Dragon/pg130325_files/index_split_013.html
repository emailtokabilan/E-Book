<pre class="calibre2"><code class="calibre3">Fisher wished that the tabletree were not rooted to the floor so he could push it into Fang and perhaps shut her up, but she just went on and on.



"...and maintaining our altitude above the disk without wormdrive, we'll be expending our fuel supply. It isn't unlimited. We can replenish it only very slowly with the high temperatures and low densities above the disk. Adding to that, the time to next outburst will limit our visit duration. We simply must make all haste to secure a dragon once we reach SS Cygni."



"And so?" Fisher prompted.



"It is clear that using our missiles as soon as possible is the most effective means to secure a dragon, dead or alive," Fang stated unequivocally. "It is the best course."



She was outrageous! Every week the dragon meeting had eventually worked around to Fang's persistent desire to fire her weapons. She was nothing more than a livestock hauler, a modern cowboy at best, a glorified button pusher at worst. She sat there, so smug in her perfect white uniform playing as if she were a military commander. This was science, not war. Give her a weapon arsenal that would be the envy of a small colony, and suddenly she was power mad: Fire the missiles! Fire the missiles!



Why couldn't she be more like she was in her cabin?



"That may not be necessary," Devereaux interjected. "Certainly we can spend a few days investigating, gathering data, before making that decision. I've been making progress determining dragon numbers and location, but the uncertainties are still large. The outburst timescale does vary, and we can adjust our arrival time to give us a long visit between outbursts."



"We fire at a dragon as a last resort," Fisher said. "To fire immediately would be like...like a premature ejaculation!"



"Please, can we keep the discussion out of the gutter?" Stearn asked.



Everyone stopped and looked at the Jack.



Devereaux smiled knowingly and Henderson scowled.

<p class="calibre1">Fisher, also unsmiling, turned back to Fang and met her icy gaze. "I apologize."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sylvia," Fang asked. "Is it true that the SS Cygni disk is experiencing an increased mass transfer rate compared to historical norms?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, but we really need more data. The time dilation works both ways and -- "</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fang continued. "The dwarf novae outbursts are more powerful and more frequent, aren't they?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It seems so, but -- "</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So our timetable should be accelerated. I am merely proposing the most logical way of doing that. This is quite reasonable." Fang smiled and spread her hands apart, palms upturned. "We can always try to capture a live specimen afterwards, if it seems appropriate."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fisher shook his head. "I've almost got the beast's bioelectric field nailed. With modifications to the shuttles we ought to be able to herd a dragon right into the Karamojo. Surely we should go for that first."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You still have time to convince me," Fang said, eyebrows arched high, "I am the captain, and I will make the final decision. I am responsible for this ship, this mission, and I won't take unnecessary risks."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"How about this," Devereaux offered. "We send a prospector ahead. We have several on our manifest, and we can get some advance data, a few days worth at least. Then we can make an informed decision without spending the extra resources."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fang considered it and finally said, "That would be agreeable."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fisher nodded and said nothing. What he thought was this: Why must you be like this when you're playing Captain? Why must you have a trophy? I won't have you killing my dragon.</p>
