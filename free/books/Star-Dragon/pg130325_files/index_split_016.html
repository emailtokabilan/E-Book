<p class="calibre1">Lena, which was how she thought of herself only in the privacy of her cabin, applied the passion-pink lipstick and listened to Ravel's Bolero while she waited for her lover. No frivolous bodmods like auto-make-up for her, nothing as slightly permanent as that even. Her cabin was her safe place, her place to be feminine, pretty, but it was essential that such things not leave with her when she was outside, when she became Captain Fang.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They were her secrets, kept to herself and her occasional lovers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The door chimed and admitted Samuel.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lena coyly glanced over her shoulder, giving him a mock look of surprise. Mock because she had planned on him catching her there in front of her mirror in only a short and sheer pink robe, untied, that she hadn't worn in front of him before.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then without either saying a word, his arms were around her, sweeping her up powerfully -- something she would never permit outside the cabin -- and carrying her to the bed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lena buried her nose in the nape of his neck and inhaled his unmodified, intoxicating scent. Pure Sam, pure male. She reached up and twisted her fingers into his dark curls, attempting to pull him down like a kraken sinking an old merchant marine frigate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He resisted, shook free, and tossed her down before him. His body followed hers, shedding clothes like an ablating heat shield during a reentry. His hands gripped her wrists tightly above her head, and his legs pried apart her legs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She loved it, this submission she gave herself over to only here where she was absolutely safe and not responsible.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He was strong and fast as she hooked her ankles into the small of his back. He lasted just long enough for her -- they both cried out -- before collapsing heavily on top. His weight felt comfortable on her, like a warm, thick blanket, and his salty sweat dripped from his face and neck onto hers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lena realized that she hadn't thought of command for several minutes and smiled. Perhaps now was the time to share even more. Warm and safe, she asked, "Did I ever tell you about my grandfather?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mmm...just that you stayed with him sometimes when you were growing up."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lena swallowed, her mouth suddenly dry, and rubbed her cheek against Samuel's shoulder. "He was the most wonderful man, so very patient with me, even when I was being a little shit."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">She poked him in the ribs and went on.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You know about leviathans, don't you? On Tau Ceti Prime. I mean, you're an exobiologist and -- " </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, I know about leviathans."</p>
<p class="calibre1">She would do it. She would tell him. Maybe this time it would help.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I was playing with the leviathan lure. Grandfather kept it locked inside a box, but I'd broken the code -- it was my birthday -- and I was playing with the lure. It was pretty, like a star, shiny and grand, so much bigger in appearance than it really was." Lena became silent and listened to Samuel's breathing over the gentle susurration of the waves outside. How could she tell him this next part? She had started now, and she needed to tell it all, to have someone who was truly human understand. It had been a long time since she had last shared this story. It was her fault, her fault for not acting when there had still been a chance, but Lord, those eyes....</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I have it," Samuel announced out of the blue.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Have what?" Lena whispered, her voice sounding low and throaty without a hint of her practiced bark, the way it did only when she was thoroughly relaxed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The green glow," he said standing up to pace the room. "It just came to me while I was thinking about how to keep cool during sex. It's a cooling system that allows the dragon to dump excess heat. The wavelength doesn't make sense for a standard atomic laser transition, but it's probably a tunable molecule, or a small suite of them, and given the profile of the emission line, I'm sure I can figure out the mechanism."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Without his body against hers, goosebumps erupted across her skin. Without his attention, something similar was occurring in her heart. "Come back to bed, Sam. I was telling you something important."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her kept pacing back and forth between the vanity and the door. "Just a second, right? This is a breakthrough. Respect the idea coming here."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chilled, she crawled beneath the sheets and held them tightly to her chin. "Please, Sam. Not now."</p>
<p class="calibre1">He stopped then and looked at her, lifting his eyebrows in a conscious expression. "I'm sorry, but I thought you were done. You know how I work, how I have to give a problem my complete attention." He suddenly turned his head as if listening to something far away and gave her a half-smile, showing a dimple. "You know, you look really sweet, wrapped up in the sheets like that. A soft-winged angel wrapped in clouds, saying please. It's such a nice change from when you're in that uniform, being bitchy about how to bag a dragon."</p>
<p class="calibre1">He came to bed and tried to wrap his arms around her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She shrugged him away, annoyed with him. Then she flung away the sheets, too, as she was suddenly stiflingly hot. She stood up and walked to the doors overlooking the beach, and turned her back on them to regard the man in her bed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's wrong, darling?" he asked, eyes wide in what appeared only mock concern -- the emotion needed to make the look genuine was simply not there. "Don't you think I'm right about the laser cooling?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Air involuntarily escaped her mouth in a sound of disbelief. "I'm in the middle of sharing something important with you, and suddenly you jump up out of bed and start ranting about your precious dragon, and you don't know what's wrong?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're upset about the 'bitchy' comment, aren't you? You're always saying 'damn' all the time. I thought that you appreciated being thought of as a tough captain." He rose onto his knees and held his fists out in a boxing stance. "Right?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not right after making love!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Samuel went to her and tried to put his arms around her. "It's okay," he murmured.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She shrugged him away. "Not now. I'm mad at you right now."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're mad at me? Didn't we just have great sex? I already apologized for not understanding you hadn't finished your story." He moved toward her again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lena shook her head and stepped back. She knew he was obsessive, but he was also intelligent and handsome. Could he actually be this dense about her after these months? She hugged herself and pointed her elbows toward Samuel as she wondered if perhaps she had been dense about him. "Maybe you should leave."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't think so, Lena. Listen to me. I think we better work this through. Now."</p>
<p class="calibre1">She realized she was chewing on her lips and stopped. Why couldn't he see he was making it worse? She didn't wear her mask here, and her safe place suddenly felt dangerous. "Get out, Sam."</p>
<p class="calibre1">He took a deep breath and stared at her for a long moment. "Let's take a step back. I'm ready to hear about the leviathan now, okay?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lena blinked back the welling tears. She would not cry in front of him! "Get out!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">She walked toward him, hands out, ready to push him from her quarters. He was hurting her, here of all places, the only place she permitted vulnerability. She blinked wetly, and Sam became an ethereal specter, his shimmering presence taunting her. He had to be forced out now. "Get out!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">He shied away as she approached, stumbled backwards, slipping on a scavenging fish slinking across the floor, and fell on his butt.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She kicked him, not that hard, in the shoulder, knocking him over.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's wrong with you?" he said as he scuttled backwards, like a crab, away from her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Get out!" she yelled, stalking after him. "Open," she barked to the door.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam tried to stand up, and without thinking she kicked him in the face. Again, not that hard, but his lip was bleeding when he looked up at her from the hallway. "I should have known better than to risk the dragon by getting involved with you. I learned from my ex that I could mix work and love, that I could make a relationship work that way. But you obviously haven't learned how to do it. You're just a tin-plated dictator playing a game you don't understand."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Close," she yelled.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't you -- "</p>
<p class="calibre1">Flushed and out of breath, Lena fell back against the closed door and slowly slid down until she sat huddled in a ball on the floor. She cried as she hadn't cried in years, or maybe decades. Whether it was for the shattered relationship and Sam's betrayal, thinking of Grandfather, or just for herself and the years of denial with which she treated her uncertainties, she didn't know. She cried hard.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After a long while, through sniffles and a few hiccups, with her cheeks cool from the tears, she whispered. "Papa?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"We're here, daughter," he answered immediately.</p>
