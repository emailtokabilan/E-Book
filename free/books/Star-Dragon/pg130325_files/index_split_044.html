<pre class="calibre2"><code class="calibre3">"Trust me, Lena damn it," Fisher implored as the Karamojo rode the blast from the dragon's braking. "We're out of time!"



Fang sat stony-faced, squeezing the arms of her chairbeast so hard that they bled, unanswering.



The star dragon had executed an unexpected maneuver, something that would scare Henderson shitless, Fisher was sure. The creatures did in effect have fusion bombs, and had used the shockwave from one alter its course faster than anticipated. Papa hadn't anticipated this possibility, and now instead of a clear shot out of the system at an acceleration the star dragon had no chance of meeting, she was sliding down their throat.



Fisher didn't even stop to worry about what kind of radiation flux might have penetrated their shields. They had no more than an instant before they would be unable to act, the dragon so far down their gullet they could do nothing but choke on it. Their earlier capture plans were precipitated on an exterior capture of the dragon and a predefined sequence of moving charges on the primary and ancillary rails to channel the creature into the cage. They had no chance of doing anything of the sort, configured as they were for wormdrive -- now fatally interrupted.



But Fisher had a contingency plan, one that he hadn't cared to share with the others before now. He would hide no more. He was with Lena, trusted her to do what was necessary, trusted her judgment. If only she would understand and trust him. Everything depended on it.
</code></pre>
<p class="calibre1">Fisher's analysis of this star dragon's segmented body and corresponding magnetic fields had suggested a way to pry them apart. This was not something he had looked for on purpose, but he strove for thoroughness in every task he set himself. Disassembling a dragon was ugly, blunt, and required large amounts of power. Power in this energy-rich environment was no problem -- they had acquired power to spare and had monstrous capacitors ready to deliver. Execution was more a matter of will.</p>
<pre class="calibre2"><code class="calibre3">Fisher possessed the will. He was committed to their course of action. He would sacrifice this dragon if need be to make Lena's plan work.



But only Fang could give the word.



Trust me, he willed. It would be too late soon. Maybe it already was.



"Papa," Fang spat the word like she had a mouthful of poison and couldn't clear it quickly enough, "Run Fisher's program."



"It wouldn't be prudent, daughter."



"Do it!" Fang overrode.



The Karamojo rocked again.
