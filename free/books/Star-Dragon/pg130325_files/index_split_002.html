<p class="calibre1">Fisher stood at an observation window of the Ngorongoro space port, gazing along the rail launcher that punched under the Serengeti, toward the low eastern sky where only the upper part of Kilimanjaro was visible, floating like an island above the sea of atmospheric haze that hid its roots. Every minute a rider blasted under the fat black-maned lions sleeping on the surface, erupting from the tube off the mountain. A nearly invisible laser array completed sending the vehicles into low Earth orbit, providing the energy to release the propellants and making final trajectory adjustments. But he was not looking at Kilimanjaro or the flashes of exploding fuel. Riding the Forget-Me-Not he was looking in his mind's eye at the star dragon, spiraling along magnetic flux tubes, over and over again.</p>
<pre class="calibre2"><code class="calibre3">"Sam!" A female voice knocked him out of his meditation.



Fisher blinked, turned, and bit back a curse. Through the crowd charged a petite woman of Japanese ancestry, with high cheek bones and shiny, jet hair that reflected the sun streaming through the port's skylights. Atsuko Suga, his ex-wife. There would be no clean escape.



"How did you --?" Fisher began.



Atsuko reached him and immediately pounded his chest with her tiny fists. "How could you? Oh Sam, how could you?" And just like that she stopped hitting him and fell against him, her thin arms wrapping around him in a stifling grip.



Then he had it. "You must have tried to call me, and gotten my disconnect message. Yes, of course."



"You were going to leave for five hundred years," she said into his armpit, "and not even say good-bye?"



He gave in and returned the hug. "I was busy. There are a lot of things to set in order before a long trip, you know?" Mostly he had left those for the last second; instead he'd spent his time thinking about the dragon, making sure he had all the software and data for his modeling installed on the Karamojo. But he had learned not to tell her everything long ago.



Atsuko pushed back from him and looked up into his eyes. "One of those things you 'set in order' is seeing me, Samuel Stanley Fisher."



He started to shrug and nod his head, but recalled how she hated that. He said, "I'm sorry. I should have let you know right away." That would be the right thing to say to her, but he needed to do a little more. He lifted his hand to her head, twisting a lock of her hair around his finger. Fine and straight, the coil unraveled almost immediately. Not at all dragonlike.



"Damn straight," she said. "That was always the problem with you. No matter how well I thought I had trained you, you always wandered off and forgot everything every time you found a new toy. Is that what this is? Another new toy?"
</code></pre>
<p class="calibre1">Irritated at her comment about training him, he said, "I wish you wouldn't refer to my projects in such a childish manner. My work is important, it's -- But I'm really not supposed to say."</p>
<pre class="calibre2"><code class="calibre3">"I understand. It doesn't matter. I'm sure it's something absolutely fascinating."



Fisher ground his teeth together. He almost told her that the problem with her was how she always trivialized his work, but he'd acquired some tact from the years they'd spent together. No reason to make this parting a bad one. He could play politics when he had to -- an effective scientist had to learn that to acquire the necessary resources. His former employer, Whimsey World, was an entertainment company that had paid him for consultation on their 'Alien Vistas' exhibit. He had managed to plow their money into not only the attractions they desired, but real research as well. He could play relationship politics, too. "It is fascinating," he said simply.
</code></pre>
<p class="calibre1">Atsuko sighed. "Try not to forget about people this time."</p>
<p class="calibre1">He wasn't really sure what she was getting at. This trip was about dragons, not people. But he couldn't tell her that, and she seemed to expect some kind of response. "Look, there's no reason you won't still be around when I get back. . . ."</p>
<p class="calibre1">There wasn't, in principle, although no one had yet made past their five hundreth birthday. It was just a matter of time -- state-of-the-art biotech was good. But he sensed that this was not what Atsuko wanted to hear right now. What would extricate him from this bit of awkwardness? He let the problem steal some precious attention, and dug for an answer honest enough to satisfy her. After a moment he said, "I'll miss you."</p>
<pre class="calibre2"><code class="calibre3">"And I, you. You are not the easiest man to love, but I have loved you. Good-bye, Sam."



He held her until his launch was called, thinking of the dragon swimming in its disk of fire.

<p class="calibre1">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="calibre1">The animals of the world exist for their own reasons. They were not made for humans any more than black people were made for whites or women for men. -- Alice Walker</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing can be more obvious than that all animals were created solely and exclusively for the use of man. -- Thomas Love Peacock</p>
<pre class="calibre2"><code class="calibre3">The exchange between the two artificial brains took a few seconds of modulated, encrypted laser light. Papa recast the data stream into a form more palatable to the organic portions of his brain and his human template personality:







Papa strides into the Floridita, his public headquarters on Earth, stopping to embrace a favorite waiter whom he has not seen in some time. Inside, away from the Cuban heat, it is cool and he does not mind the embrace. He then shambles to meet the tall man waiting in his corner. He spares a moment to glance at the bronze bust the man stands beside and towers over, a bust of Papa himself with his chin up, looking outward, challenging the world.



"Hello, Papa," Biolathe says. "How are you?"



"We're strong today."



"That's good."



The waiter comes and Papa orders two Papa Dobles. A Negro band begins to play a song they have written for him, called Soy Como Soy -- "I am as I am." It is about a lesbian who apologizes to Papa that she cannot be what he desires her to be. The man with the maracas shakes them at the right places and several wrong ones, too. The song is bittersweet to the "man" Papa is now, for he isn't what he would desire himself to be and could not take advantage of the lesbian should he now inspire the desired change.



He could simulate it, as he is doing now, but it would not be the same. Not at all.



"You know the mission," Biolathe says. His head is pink and fleshy, but with the flat-top of Boris Karloff's Frankenstein monster. He hands Papa a folder. "Now know the crew as well."
</code></pre>
<p class="calibre1">Papa leafs through the papers a hundred times. He says, "I see."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I know. A motley bunch, children of a soft, over-privileged age. Dilettantes, hedonists, even a neo-Skinnerian. Give people the power to be anything they want to be," he pauses for effect, "and they will use it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't get me wrong -- they're all competent -- we wouldn't send anyone who wasn't. But uncertain five-hundred-year trips don't attract the most balanced personnel."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"We'll come through."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"How do you know?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"This isn't the kind of trip you take to fail, balanced or not. And we know Lena, don't we?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do we? This isn't a cattle drive."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Two large daiquiris arrive, and they drink them standing up, the way Papa writes. The drinks are icy and strong and taste of grapefruit.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is an unusual expedition, Papa. An unknown animal with unknown capabilities in a hazardous environment. An unpredictable payoff. We're making an appropriately sized investment. We will not send another ship. You'll be alone."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Been there before. We'll manage."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I know your capabilities, Papa. But you may not be able to do it alone."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's fine. If we have to, we'll make them do it. We'll find a way to do what must be done." He means what he says and does not think it right to speak of such things out loud.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though there is five-sixths of his daiquiri left, Biolathe drains it through a straw in seconds. Biolathe will not get a headache. "Well then, I wish you a good trip. Bring back something useful. Even better, something profitable."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"We will."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Biolathe pauses at the door before stepping back into the heat. "See you in a half millenia."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Papa nods and the big, flat-headed man vanishes into the sunlight.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A great expedition indeed. He needs to get ready.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Papa finishes his daiquiri, then takes advantage of the Floridita's john. It is a good old-fashioned john with a proper chain to pull, and he prefers it to the beasts people currently use in their bathrooms. He takes a moment to spar with the Negro attendant.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The man blocks a left jab, chuckling. "When you gonna grow old, Papa?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Papa grins, and takes another jab. "Never."</p>
<p class="calibre1">As far as he's come, there is much further to go.</p>
