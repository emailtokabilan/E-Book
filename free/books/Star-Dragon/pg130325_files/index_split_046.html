<pre class="calibre2"><code class="calibre3">Now that the awful spins had ceased, as well as the even more awful ringing crashes, Devereaux had the opportunity to feel nauseated. Suddenly floating free in the quiet of the bridge with nary a sneeze, she wondered for the first time if she were going to die on this trip. Well, that would solve another mystery for her at least.



She hoped that Phil was okay.
</code></pre>
<p class="calibre1">Before she could ask, Fang had fired a stream of questions at Papa. The last one was, "How long before we hit the disk?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Devereaux squeezed her eyes shut and tried to pull herself together. The Karamojo could persist in the hot corona of the disk by virtue of its rarefication. It didn't matter that the gas was so hot if there wasn't much of it -- the corona was more like vacuum than anything. There was no way their systems could handle the plasma density in the disk, even as vacuum-like as it too seemed compared to Earth's atmosphere. They would hit it, pretty soon too. How soon? Despite the biochip augmentation for superior computation, her mind was numb, unable to calculate the simple expressions derived from Newton's Laws of Motion that would let her answer the question herself. They had come out from the disk shifting orbits and the gravity was weaker, and they had a significant initial velocity....</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ten minutes, daughter," Papa said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shit," Fang hissed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Serious stuff for the captain to slip so much. Devereaux had heard her say "damn" more than a few times, but "shit" was off the scale for the bridge. Gravity was a bitch.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The drives are out, but we have the egg secured?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Right."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, fix the drives." Fang was not holding back a trump card apparently. "Rail first -- we need thrust fast."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"We'll try," Papa said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Only try? Devereaux asked, "Papa, can you put me in touch with Phil?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mister Stearn is unconscious," Papa said. "Mister Henderson is apparently conscious, but is not responsive."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Papa so formal? Not a good sign at all. Devereaux pulled in her arms to spin a little more quickly, and when in position kicked the back of her chair to head for the bridge exit.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sylvia! Stop," Fang ordered.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Devereaux was unable to suppress her startle instinct, so sharp had been Fang's command. She caught the edge of the portal and turned toward the other woman. "Why? They need help!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fang stared back from her perch on her fighting chair, face passive except for her eyes, which blinked rapidly. "We must act with precision. Let us be sure of our actions before we run about foolishly. There are important things to do here."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Were there really? Her mind drew blank. Just when Devereaux was about to resume her flight to Phil, Papa spoke. "Dr. Devereaux, the phenomenon you pointed out to us requires your attention. It's very important."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Phenomenon? The dragon migration she'd noticed? And not just 'important,' but 'very important.' How could that be in their current predicament? She would rather be with Phil at a time like this. There didn't seem to be anything she could do to help here, despite Captain Fang's admonition. The automatic repair systems were going to save them, or not, and what did it matter if she left the bridge?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fang softened, a little, and said, "Fisher can see to Stearn and Henderson, and lend a hand down there if Papa needs one. We're not dealing with a dragon any more. Good enough?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Devereaux glanced at Fisher whose wide eyes suggested that he was as surprised as she was at Fang's suggestion. Barely hesitating even though he was being asked to leave the bridge during the crisis, he took a deep breath and kicked off his couchbeast with a nod and a grunt. When he was past her and already bouncing down the corridor, Devereaux said, "Okay, Papa. Tell me what you think is going on."</p>
