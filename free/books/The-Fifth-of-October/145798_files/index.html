<p class="calibre1"><a id="p2"></a>The	Fifth	of	October</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p3"></a>By	Mary	Raymond	Shipman	Andrews Taken	from	“McClure’s	Magazine,”	Volume	35,	May	-	October,	1910</p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	road	of	life	turns	sharply	right	or	left,	according	to	a	decision;	when the	decision	must	be	ready	of	a	Monday	morning,	and	this	is	Saturday;	when	one has	five	times	gone	down	into	soul-depths	to	consider,	and	five	times	been jerked	back	by	a	rap	or	a	ring,	and	banality—when	this	is	the	state	of	affairs,	the state	of	mind	is	rasped.	One	bitterly	resents	the	fate	that	has	led	to	a	Paris	hotel, and	a	numbered	door,	and	a	telephone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girl,	Alixe,	struggling	for	calm	and	concentration,	was	aware	that	she	was listening	all	the	time	to	sounds	in	the	corridors.	Yet	her	thoughts	ran	at	length into	a	quieter,	remoter	groove;	they	slipped	across	the	ocean	to	her	own America,	to	country	roads	where	brown	earth	was	soft	and	hillsides	misty	with	a springtime	gone	by,	where	she	rode	a	horse	through	fresh	weather,	through woods	starred	with	white	trilliums;	and	riding	beside	her	was	the	Only	Man	in the	World—the	man	who	would	never	forgive	her.	By	the	pang	that	came	as	she remembered	those	rides,	she	knew	that,	whether	he	forgave	her	or	not,	she	cared for	him	still.	But	the	girl	was	not	of	the	Griselda	pattern—not	meek.	She	had humbled	herself,	had	gone	all	the	way.	It	had	been	her	fault;	she	had	been unpardonable:	yet,	she	was	worth	pardoning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	the	man	had	failed	her.	He	had	not	seen,—through	the	things	she	did, which	were	unworthy,	the	thing	that	she	was,	which	was	worth	while.	She	had taken	her	pride—her	very	stiff	pride—in	her	hand,	and	said	that	she	was	sorry; had	tried	to	show	him	that	it	was	not	the	regular	traveling	of	a	small	nature,	but the	running	off	the	track	of	a	warm	and	generous	one.	And	the	man	would	not see.	By	that	she	knew	that	he	was	limited	and	vain.	Yes,	but	he	was	other	things</p>
<p class="calibre1">—himself,	above	all.	I	t	is	hard	to	resolve	personality	entirely	into	qualities;	it holds,	often,	when	qualities	go	to	pieces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girl	made	for	the	man	the	allowances	he	would	not	make	for	her.	She	knew about	wounded	vanity,	and	she	knew	how	self-distrust	develops	wounded	vanity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	added	up	columns	for	and	against,	and	reckoned	that	limitation	and	vanity did	not	count	against	the	large	things	set	to	his	credit;	when	she	had	added	and subtracted	over	and	over,	the	result	was	still	altogether	desirable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	arithmetic	did	not	occur	immediately	after	the	quarrel,	which	was	two	years</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p4"></a>before.	At	that	time	she	had	merely	floundered	and	said,	in	many	forms,	the wrong	thing.	So	that	the	man	was	more	fixed	in	a	pig-headed,	iron-bound,	steel-clamped	obstinacy	never	to	forgive	her.	He	let	her	alone	violently,	counting	it unto	himself	for	righteousness	and	a	firm	character;	and	she	suffered	and	grew—</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	gradually	grew—strong.	And	now	she	could	add	up	the	debit	and	credit, and	think	of	him,	no	more	as	a	demigod	whose	smile	or	frown	made	the	weather, but	as	a	headstrong,	warm-hearted,	clever,	stupid	boy-man,	who,	though	he would	never	forgive	her,	yet	somehow,	with	his	big	brain	and	body	and	heart	tied to	much	childishness,	continued	to	be	the	high-water	mark	of	desirableness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet—he	would	never	forgive	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	the	Prince	insisted	that	she	should	marry	him.	An	eligible	prince,	with	a family	tree	and	castles—a	fortune,	moreover.	The	background	was	satisfying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girl	liked	it.	Most	normal	girls	have	no	objection	to	princes	and	glitter	and glow,	as	princes	and	glitter	and	glow.	It	would	be	amusing	to	be	a	princess;	she would	like	the	title—and,	moreover,	she	liked	the	Prince.	He	was	not	a	great man,	but	he	was	quick-witted	and	lovable.	It	proved	him	to	be	different	from	the ruck	of	princes	that	he	was	mad	about	her,	for	the	girl	was	not	an	heiress.	She had	explained	this	carefully,	and	he	had	laughed,	with	his	flashing	eyes	spilling over	two	or	three	meanings—impulsive,	adoring,	mirthful;	he	certainly	was Prince	Charming,	besides	his	other	long	names. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,	Mademoiselle—one	sees	I	have	thirty	cents,	as	you	says	it.	I	don’t	care	if you	are	rich	or	not,	if	you	are	yourself.	Me—I	have	money	like	gee-whiz.”	(The Prince	desired	to	speak	English	colloquially.) So	there	the	case	stood.	On	one	side,	the	Only	Man	in	the	World	lost	to	sight,	to memory	dear—and	a	lifelong	spinsterhood;	on	the	other	side,	gay	and	brilliant years	beckoning	to	a	right-footed	couple	resembling	herself	and	that	dear	boy, the	Prince.	This	was	the	problem,	and	she	had	set	this	morning	apart	to	answer	it, and	had	shut	herself	up	in	her	room	at	the	Hotel	Normandie	for	the	purpose.	For on	Monday	morning	she	had	promised	that	she	would	give	the	Prince,	who,	for an	impatient	and	spoiled	lad,	had	been	patient,	his	answer.	And,	every	two minutes	since	she	had	locked	her	door,	had	come	a	knock	at	it,	or	a	ring	at	the telephone,	with	commonplace	to	follow.	Each	small	interruption	left	her	less	able to	focus	her	mind	on	the	one	big	thing	in	life;	until,	finally,	on	her	reverie	of	old rides	broke	the	sixth	rap. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p5"></a>“Entrez,”	the	girl	said,	quietly	enough—so	little,	fortunately,	do	the	tones	of	the trained	express	their	feelings;	and	the	husky	French	chambermaid	man	deposited a	box	on	the	table—the	adorable	pink	hat	from	the	Rue	de	la	Paix.	“Merci,”	she said,	and	the	black-mustached	gentleman	was	gone.	But	in	his	place,	stood	Elsie</p>
<p class="calibre1">—her	young	sister,	sixteen,	full	of	romance,	thrilled	with	the	big	sister’s	love affairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ve	done	nothing	but	pound	at	your	door,	Alixe,	all	this	morning.	I	tried	to stop	them,	but	mother	had	me	clutched,	running	ribbons,	and	every	time	I	was too	late.	It’s	a	crime.	It’s	no	use	trying	to	get	a	quiet	moment	in	this	bedlam	of	a hotel.	But	I	have	an	idea—I	know	how	you	can	skip	the	pandemonium	and	get	a chance	to	think	in	peace.	You	trust	your	Aunt	Elsie.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alixe	sighed.	“There’s	no	peace	to	be	got	in	a	large	family.	I’ll	have	to	toss	up	a penny	in	the	end—I	know	I	will,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	you	won’t—I’ll	see	to	that.	I	know	how	to	manage,”	Elsie	assured	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen.	Tomorrow	is	Sunday,	and	the	fountains	play	at	Versailles.	The McMillans	are	going	to	motor	out,	and	we’ll	go	with	them—you	and	I.	Then, when	we	get	there,	we’ll	lose	them.	They	won’t	care;	they’ll	be	glad.	They’re always	grateful	for	being	left	alone.	We’ll	come	back	by	train.	And	you	and	I will	wander	over	to	the	Petit	Trianon	Park,	to	the	bameau.	It’s	always	deserted when	the	fountains	are	playing,	and	it’s	a	perfect	place	to	think	out	a	love problem.	Oh,	I	don’t	mean	to	be	fresh.	It’s	a	horrid	hole	you’re	in.	I	wouldn’t have	your	responsibility	for	a	thousand	dollars	a	minute.	Hideous!	The	Prince	is a	dear,	and	that	would	be	easy	and	satisfactory,	and	mother	is	frantic	for	fear	you won’t.	But,	then—Jim	Arnold.	Suppose	you	met	him	after,	and	saw	that	he	liked you	still,	and	it	was	too	late.	Awful!	And	the	Prince	isn’t	a	patch	on	Jim	Arnold</p>
<p class="calibre1">—really	and	truly.	Yet	he	is	a	dear,	and	mother	would	die	of	joy.	It’s heartbreaking!	I	do	understand,	Alixe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	do—you’re	a	comfort.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	she	knew	that	nobody	understood.	Elsie	was	her	lifelong	friend,	and	Elsie knew	as	much	as	any	separate	human	being	might.	But	no	separate	human	being might	know	the	most	real	part	of	it.	Nobody	could	help	her.	She	must	fight	it	out alone—which	is	always	the	case,	when	a	fight	matters. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p6"></a>However,	Elsie’s	idea	of	the	scene	for	the	drama	appealed	to	her.	The	little hamlet,	the	plaything	of	Marie	Antoinette,	set,	with	its	thatched	roofs	and simplicity,	into	the	royal	park;	the	twilight	of	trees	which	folded	about	it;	the whispers	of	wind	always	there,	which	seemed	like	the	ghosts	of	voices;	the memories	of	lords	and	ladies	raking	hay	and	making	butter	with	awkward jeweled	hands;	more	than	all,	the	thought	of	the	girl	queen	who	tried	so	hard, though	a	queen,	to	be	happy	as	a	woman—all	this	shadowy	old	romance	filled the	place	with	fascination	for	the	girl	from	a	new,	unshaded	country.	Elsie’s	plan was	good;	they	would	do	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	McMillans’	car	fled	through	Paris,	from	Paris	over	the	eleven	miles	to Versailles.	The	little	bride	and	groom	laughed	at	everything	and	at	nothing;	and Alixe	and	Elsie	laughed	with	them,	as	if	they	were	not	conspirators.	And	almost at	once	they	were	walking	about	in	the	crowd	down	the	lanes	of	clipped	growth that	led	to	the	Neptune	Fountain.	Marble	statues	gleamed	high	against	the	walls of	the	hedges;	vistas	reached	to	fairy	lakes,	to	dim,	formal	avenues	which	melted in	shadows.	Looking	this	way	and	that	down	the	dark	all�es,	one	saw	at	the farther	end	the	white	shaft	of	a	fountain	rising	in	mist	and	in	brilliancy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girl’s	imagination	ran	away	with	her.	Her	mind	was	of	the	kind	poised lightly	between	material	and	immaterial	things.	The	loveliness	of	Versailles,	with its	memories	and	its	ghosts,	its	tragedies	and	comedies	and	gaieties,	seized	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	seemed	to	feel	another	atmosphere,	to	see	other	beings	than	those	who talked	to	her	and	jostled	her.	There	was	a	presence—to	the	mind	of	the	girl—in an	enormous	wig,	with	sword	at	the	side,	in	glory	of	blue	satin	and	scent	and laces,	a	presence	which	strutted	along	the	wooded	lanes,	followed	by	a	gorgeous company.	King	Louis	XIV	of	France—Louis	the	Great—walked	in	his	gardens of	Versailles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	strong	was	the	illusion	that	she	found	herself	moving	aside	for	the	passing	of that	long-dead,	arrogant	crowd.	It	was	gone,	and	out	from	the	maze	of	clipped greenness	seemed	to	ring	voices.	A	girl	in	a	shepherdess	costume	came	flying, and	behind	the	girl	was	the	scowling	face	of	a	lady-in-waiting,	the	old	Comtesse de	Noailles;	who	angrily	hobbled	after;	then	young	lords	and	more	ladies, laughing	at	the	Queen,	laughing	at	cross	“Madame	Etiquette,”	who	could	by	no exercise	of	dignity	keep	in	order	“the	Austrian,”	the	girl	Marie	Antoinette. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	other	girl,	standing	in	the	Queen’s	garden	a	century	after	that	head	had fallen	from	its	slim	shoulders,	dreamed	of	the	crowd	of	figures	that	had	walked</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a>the	history-haunted	lanes,	until	the	past	was	almost	reality.	She	started	at	her sister’s	touch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	lost,”	Elsie	said.	“Bully!	I	didn’t	think	I	could	do	it	so	fast.	Now,	scoot; let’s	be	away	from	here	before	they’re	struck	conscientious	and	look	us	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	two	found	their	way	through	waves	of	milliners	and	barbers,	away	from	the huge	Bassin	de	Neptune,	through	the	gardens	past	the	Bassin	d	Apollon,	and then,	from	the	pile	of	palaces,	into	quiet	paths,	past	the	Grand	Trianon,	past	the Petit	Trianon	standing	in	Greek	haughtiness	of	simplicity;	and	with	that	they were	in	the	stillness	of	the	park,	and	surrounded	by	the	twelve	buildings	of	the bameau,	the	play-village	of	Marie	Antoinette. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nous	v’l�!”	Elsie	announced.	“I	told	you!	Not	a	human!	You	can	think	your head	off.	I’m	going	for	a	wander	by	myself—I’ve	been	dying	to	prowl	about	this place	without	Mama,	and	this	is	my	chance,	so	good-by	for	an	hour.”	She	turned her	wrist	to	look	at	the	watch	strapped	to	it.	“For	an	hour	and	a	half,	Alixe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s	a	train	then.	I’ll	come	for	you,	and	meantime	you	can	have	it	out	with yourself.	Isn’t	it	quiet?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	heaven,”	Alixe	agreed.	“Don’t	go	far—you	won’t	get	into	mischief,	child?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No—oh,	no!”	And	Elsie’s	character	was	such	that	the	older	sister	took	her	word for	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	is	a	grassy	slope	in	the	shadow	of	the	trees,	near	the	tiny	lake,	where, reflected	in	the	water,	one	sees	the	thatched	roofs	and	balconies	of	the	house	of the	“farmer”—the	farmer	whom	the	guillotine	killed,	who	was	Louis	XVI	of France.	Alixe	leaned	her	head	against	a	tree	and	forgot	herself	and	her	own affairs,	and	like	the	waves	of	a	quiet	river	the	memories	of	the	place	rippled	over her.	Over	there	in	the	little	mill	the	King	had	played	miller	and	shouldered	sacks of	corn;	the	stone	steps	to	the	“boudoir”	were	mossy	now,	where	once	the	feet	of the	Austrian	had	run	up	and	down;	down	a	pathway	the	door	of	the	Queen’s theater	still	peeped	from	the	trees;	“Marlborough’s	Tower”	frowned	still	in	toy grimness	above	the	dairy-house.	Alixe	almost	believed	she	heard	a	voice	singing out	of	the	quiet.	It	was	the	nurse,	who	sang	to	the	Queen’s	children:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Malbrouck	s’en	va	t’en	guerre, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sa	dame	�	sa	tour	monte.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>The	nurse	sang	the	old	rhyme,	and	the	children	sang	it	after	her	in	baby	French; and	their	mother,	the	Queen,	named	this	tiny	tower,	to	please	them, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Marlborough’s	Tower.”	The	traditions	that	Alixe	had	read	of	the	place	crowded to	her	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	center	of	all	was	the	humble	“Maison	du	Seigneur”—the	house	of	the farmer.	On	that	balcony	the	Queen	had	come	out	in	her	white	lawn	dress	of	a farmer’s	wife,	and	the	King,	a	Watteau	peasant	in	dress,	had	followed	her, laughing;	and	the	two	had	called	to	the	milkmaids	going	in	and	out	of	the	door	of the	dairy—a	dairy	with	marble	benches,	with	pails	of	S�vres	china—milkmaids who	were	duchesses	and	princesses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	to	Alixe	a	charm	in	the	thought	of	the	milkmaids,	because	one	of them	had	been	her	own	ancestress,	Alixe	de	Courtailles,	a	favorite	of	the	Queen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Afterward,	in	the	Terror,	she	had	fled	to	America,	and	through	five	generations her	name	had	been	kept	and	was	to-day	the	name	of	the	foreigner	who	came back	to	sit	among	the	ghosts	of	the	Queen’s	village. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alixe	de	Courtailles!	The	Alixe	of	America	fell	to	wondering	what	her kinswoman	had	looked	like.	She	imagined	she	caught	a	glimpse,	through	the open	door	of	the	dairy,	of	a	young	face,	blue-eyed	and	alert	and	winning.	It	was easy	to	animate	the	place	with	those	figures,	long	dust—stately	heads	whose	rest had	at	last	been	the	guillotine,	satin-shod	feet	which	had	fled	through	blood, laughing	eyes	which	had	wept	the	loss	of	everything	that	meant	happiness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	breeze	rustled	in	the	chestnuts	above	the	girl’s	head,	touched	the	quiet	lake, and	lifted	the	leaves	of	the	bushes	as	if	a	hand	brushed	them	this	way	and	that.	It was	gone;	yet	there	was	still	a	whisper	of	it,	like	voices,	far	down	the	path	that led	through	the	Wood.	Like	voices?	There	were	voices.	Alixe	turned	and	looked down	the	path.	People!	Through	the	light	and	shadow	came	a	flash	of	white; there	were	women.	A	laugh	broke	distinctly,	and	then,	nearer,	a	soft	chorus	of voices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	once	Alixe	was	back	in	the	present,	troubled	and	irritated.	What	a	nuisance! </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had	come	so	far	to	be	alone,	and	here	were	French	shop-people	spoiling	her solitude.	The	group,	floating	toward	her	with	a	murmur	of	talking,	all	at	once seemed	to	be	aware	of	her,	and	movement	and	sound	stopped.	Alixe	realized suddenly	that	the	voices	which	had	become	silent	were	not	the	sharp	tones	of shop-people,	but	low	and	well-bred,	and	that	the	dozen	people	standing,	half	in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>the	shadow	of	the	trees,	half	in	the	blurred	sunlight,	regarding	her,	carried themselves	with	dignity	and	pride. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	wave	of	apologetic	shyness	seized	her,	as	if	she	might	be	the	intruder,	not	they. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	with	surprise,	she	caught	the	gleam	of	pink	and	of	blue	satin,	of	laces,	of powdered	hair	and	feathers.	The	next	second	her	attention	was	fixed	on	a	young woman	who	stepped	from	the	company,	dressed	in	white.	A	straw	hat	was	on	the curls	that	lay	loosely	on	her	shoulders.	It	was	the	plainest	of	costumes,	except—</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	girl’s	eyes	opened	as	they	marked	the	exception—a	string	of	magnificent rubies	lay	around	her	neck,	like	drops	of	blood	linked	closely;	there	was	an aggressive	brilliance	in	them.	The	young	woman	spoke,	with	gentleness,	with charm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	fear	that	we	have	disturbed	Mademoiselle,”	she	said.	“I	am	desolated.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alixe	stood	before	the	Frenchwoman	with	that	odd	impression	of	a	trespasser	on private	property.	“Oh,	no;	surely—it	is	I—”	she	stammered.	And	then	she regained	composure.	“It	is	you	to	whom	the	park	belongs,	Madame—to	the French,”	she	said,	smiling	her	response	to	the	friendly	face.	“I	am	only	a	stranger from	America.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“From	America!”	The	newcomer	repeated	the	words.	She	turned	a	trifle	toward the	figures	grouped	behind	her—a	mere	trifle,	as	if	she	knew	that	a	movement	of hers	would	be	noted.	“I	have	a	wish	to	talk	to	Mademoiselle,”	she	said	gently, over	her	shoulder.	“I	wish	to	talk	to	Mademoiselle	alone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	seemed	to	Alixe	as	if	the	bunch	of	bright	colors	on	the	edge	of	the	wood melted	into	the	russet,	blue,	and	black-green	shadows.	She	was	sitting	again	on the	slope	of	the	grass,	and	the	strange	lady	sat	by	her,	and	they	talked	like	old friends.	It	was	curious	how	easy	it	was	to	talk	to	her.	The	girl	told	her,	smiling, of	her	dreams;	how	she	had	imagined	King	Louis	XVI	and	the	Queen	and	their friends	at	play	in	this	park. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	love	to	come	here,”	she	said.	“It	makes	that	bit	of	history	vivid—most	of	all, the	Queen.	The	place	is	full	of	her,	and	everybody	loves	Marie	Antoinette,	you know.	In	all	history	there	isn’t	any	figure,	I	think,	that	has	better	kept	its	reality and	the	affection	of	the	world.	Because	she	was	so	human—that	is	why	human beings	love	her	still.	She	stood	the	test	like	a	Queen	and	a	heroine—yet	she	was normal	and	womanly.	It	makes	you	feel	as	if	every	human	woman	might</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>possibly	have	heroism,	if	the	need	came.”	She	looked	about	at	the	quiet	little	old buildings	among	the	trees.	“Yes,	indeed,	people	love	Marie	Antoinette	after	a hundred	years.	I	think	after	a	thousand	they	will	love	her	the	same.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alixe’s	gaze	came	back	to	her	new	friend’s	face,	and	she	saw	with	astonishment that	the	Frenchwoman’s	blue	eyes	were	full	of	tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	it	the	truth?”	the	stranger	asked,	with	a	slight	break	across	the	words.	“It would	be	pleasant	to	Marie	Antoinette	of	France	to	know	that.	She	cared	most for	that—for	love—far	more	than	for	greatness.	She	would	have	been	glad	to have	lived—to	have	died,	even,	I	believe—if	she	might	know	what Mademoiselle	has	told	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girl	was	surprised	at	the	emphasis	which	the	newcomer	appeared	to	lay	on her	words;	yet	she	considered	the	emotional	French	nature,	and	it	came	to	her that	this	charming	person	was	taking	her	as	a	representative	of	her	nation,	of America;	for	that	reason	her	words	carried	weight.	She	went	on—it	was	odd	how the	stranger	seemed	to	draw	out	her	intimate	thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	proud	to	have	a	little	link	with	the	Queen—if	I	may	call	it	as	much	as	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	any	case,	I	feel	through	four	generations	a	little	right	of	loyalty	to	her;	for,	you see,	Madame,	my	great-great-grandmother	was	one	of	her	ladies.	And	the	Queen cared	for	her.	Her	name	was—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alixe	de	Courtailles.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	low	voice	took	the	words	from	the	girl’s	lips	before	they	were	spoken.	Alixe gazed	with	eyes	wide	open.	She	was	aware	of	a	slight	fear	creeping	through	her, as	of	something	unprecedented.	She	looked	into	the	face	of	the	Frenchwoman, and	she	saw	the	rubies	around	the	throat	gleam	as	if	alive.	She	could	not	speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	the	other	spoke	at	once,	easily,	reassuringly:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	astonishes	you,	Mademoiselle,	that	I	know	this	name?	Ah,	but	there	are	so many	ways	of	knowing	things,	and	spirit	speaks	to	spirit	so	distinctly,	when	they are	kin.	And	the	world	holds	much	besides	the	machinery	that	seems	to	make	its life.	You	and	I,	Mademoiselle,	we	are	strangers,	is	it	not?	And	yet	we	are	of	a closeness—I	recognized	it	so,	Mademoiselle,	at	your	first	word.	I	could	tell	you other	things	of	yourself,	if	I	might—for	example,	it	is	very	plain	to	me	that	you are	troubled,	perplexed,	over	a	question—that	you	have,	it	may	be,	a	decision	to make.	Is	it	not	true,	Mademoiselle?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>Alixe,	gazing	into	the	clear	eyes,	felt	no	desire	to	cover	any	secret	from	them.	“It is	true,”	she	said	simply,	and	waited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	comes,	at	times,	to	a	fork	in	life’s	road,	when	one	has	to	choose	most definitely	the	way,”	the	rippling	tones	went	on,	in	exquisite	crisp	French	which yet	had,	to	the	girl’s	ear,	a	touch	of	something	foreign,	something	uncommon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	voice	went	on:	“One	must	choose.	Perhaps	a	road	is	gilded—it	leads	to greatness	and	riches.	It	dazzles,	it	lures.	They	are	good	things	to	look	at, greatness	and	riches.	Yet,	Mademoiselle,	I	tell	you—I	who	have	known—that	it is	not	a	reason	to	decide	one’s	life,	to	be	great,	to	be	rich.	When	one	is	too	great it	is	tiresome	-ennuyant.	It	is	to	be	tied	with	chains.	Chains	are	not	more comfortable	to	wear	because	of	glittering.	Always	there	are	formalities.	One	may not	speak	or	act	naturally—hardly	one	may	think	naturally.	And	riches—ah!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	delicate	hand	brushed	aside	wealth	with	a	quick	gesture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	to	be	choked	with	flowers	and	bonbons	to	be	very	rich;	and	to	be	choked	is not	agreeable—is	it	not	so,	Mademoiselle?	When	one	has	always	new	pleasures, one	has	no	time	to	enjoy	any	pleasure;	one	has	no	time	to	enjoy	those	who	are dearest—friends,	family,	children.	All	these	must	be	neglected	in	the	hurry	from the	last	toy	to	the	next.	There	is	no	simplicity,	no	leisure—it	is	so	that	life becomes	a	treadmill.	Also,	the	joy	of	life	goes;	one	loses	the	power	to	taste pleasure—tasting	too	much.	Believe	me,	for	I	have	known,	it	is	not	too	happy	a life,	even	when	one	is	most	lucky,	to	be	great	and	rich.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Frenchwoman’s	manner	changed	suddenly,	winningly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	Mademoiselle	does	not	need	a	sermon	on	the	dangers	of	the	great world.	It	may	be	that	Mademoiselle’s	difficulty	is	of	another	sort.	I	believe, indeed,	however,	that	Mademoiselle’s	question	is	an	old	one—the	question	of	a man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alixe’s	color	came.	But	she	answered,	as	before,	with	directness—the personality	of	this	stranger	seemed	to	compel	that.	“Yes,”	she	said;	“it	is—of	a man.	How	could	you	tell?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Frenchwoman	laughed.	“But	that	is	easy.	Mademoiselle	is	young	and charming.	When	it	is	so,	there	is	always	a	question	of	a	man.	Of	a	truth, Mademoiselle	is	charming	enough	to	make	it	all	simply	a	question	of	two	men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Am	I	right?	There	are	two?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>And	the	girl	said	quietly:	“Yes,	Madame,	there	are	two.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	distance,	beyond	the	screen	of	shrubbery,	some	one	was	singing—Elsie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alixe	turned	her	head	to	look.	She	did	not	want	to	be	interrupted	yet.	Elsie	was not	in	sight.	When	she	turned	back,	the	Frenchwoman	stood	before	her,	an ethereal	white	figure,	the	hands	stretched,	almost	as	if	blessing	her.	As	she	lifted her	eyes,	the	strange	necklace	flamed—one	would	certainly	have	thought	that drops	of	blood	circled	the	throat.	For	a	second	the	two	looked	at	each	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	the	clear	voice	spoke,	more	clearly,	more	slowly	than	before:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mademoiselle—must	not	make	a	decision—tomorrow	morning.	Mademoiselle</p>
<p class="calibre1">—must	wait	until—the	afternoon.	Absolutely.	Il	faut.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alixe—Alixe,	where	are	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girl	whirled	to	hush	her	sister.	It	seemed	sacrilege	to	shout	so	in	the	very presence	of—the	presence	of	whom?	She	turned	back	swiftly—for	Elsie	was	yet hidden—to	answer	her	own	thought.	There	was	no	one	there.	The	girl	stood staring	about	her,	but	could	not	catch	even	the	gleam	of	a	white	gown	down	the path.	Yet	it	was	dim	there,	and	the	path	twisted.	And	with	that	appeared	the	little sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Elsie,	did	you	see	her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See	which?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	lady—in	a	white	dress.	She	was	here	a	second	ago,	when	you	called.	How did	she	get	away	so	suddenly?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	see	anything,”	declared	Elsie.	“Who	was	she?	Didn’t	you	know	her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	Elsie—the	most	wonderful	person!	I—don’t	understand—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elsie	picked	up	the	thread:	“What	don’t	you	understand?	What’s	the	matter	with you,	Alixe?	You	act	dotty.	I	believe—yes,	sir,	I	believe	you	went	to	sleep.	A	lady in	white!	Which	is	no	use	at	all—but	just	like	you.	When	time	is	worth	four dollars	a	second,	you	take	hunks	of	it	for	dreaming	and	such.	You	need	me, asleep	or	awake,	and	that’s	the	truth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen,	Elsie.”	She	told	the	story	of	the	talk	with	the	Frenchwoman;	of	the	name</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>of	Alixe	de	Courtailles	slipped	into	her	own	sentence;	of	the	startling	way	in which	her	thoughts	had	been	read;	last	of	all,	of	the	command	that	her	decision should	be	postponed	until	Monday	afternoon.	What	did	it	mean?	Who	was	this unknown	person	who	knew	all	about	her?	Wasn’t	it	mysterious?	The	older	girl, impressionable,	poetical,	threw	herself,	as	often	happens	in	this	material	world, on	the	untroubled	sense	of	the	commonplace	other.	The	commonplace	other	was equal	to	the	burden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tommy-rot,”	she	pronounced.	“In	the	first	place,	you	were	asleep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wasn’t.”	Alixe	was	firm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	then—I	didn’t	think	you	were,	either,	only	I	thought	I’d	try	that	on	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well—you	say	they	were	all	in	some	sort	of	fancy	dress?	Now,	isn’t	that	French? </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	just	a	bunch	of	actresses	out	for	a	country	spree,	in	costume,	to	be plus	gai—isn’t	it	just	too	French?	And	you	struck	the	leading	lady.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh!	If	you	could	have	seen	her,	Elsie,	you	wouldn’t	talk	like	that.	Anyhow,	it doesn’t	explain	what	she	did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	it	does.	Frenchwomen,	and	especially	people	like	actresses,	are	abnormally clever.	They	skin	your	soul,	and	you	never	suspect.	I’ve	read	about	it—I	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sixteen-year-old	head	nodded	wisely.	“You	had	mentioned	Alixe	de Courtailles—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	hadn’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	thought	you	hadn’t,	but	somehow	she	got	it	from	you—and	then	she sprang	it	on	you.	And	the	rest	the	same	way.	She	extracted	it	all	out	of	you,	and ricochetted	it	around	at	you	as	brand-new.	Oh,	I’ve	heard	about	more	marvelous stunts	than	that.	Or	telepathy,	you	know—she	may	have	been	the	queen-bee telepather.	We	had	a	lot	about	that	in	school	last	term,	and	it’s	a	fact	that	they squeegee	things	out	of	people	without	a	word	said.	Hypnotism,	too—why,	it’s easy;	there	are	a	dozen	ways	to	explain.	The	lovely	lady	was	having	the	time	of her	life	with	you.	You	say	yourself	that	you	felt	a	powerful	inclination	to	tell secrets—well,	you	did.	See?	And	then	she	told	them	back	to	you.	I	understand—</p>
<p class="calibre1">but	it	was	interesting,	and	exactly	the	kind	of	thing	to	happen	to	a	dreamy	old juggins	like	you.	She	sized	you	up	when	she	saw	you,	I’ll	bet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	did	say—something—like	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>“You	see,”	Elsie	crowed.	“Trust	your	Aunt	Elsie!	I	wouldn’t	be	a	bit	surprised	to see	in	the	paper	tomorrow	that	Madame	Celeste,	the	champion	mind-reader	of the	Cirque	d’�t�,’	or	something,	had	been	giving	a	fete	at	Versailles.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	Elsie!	You	are	a	vulgar	little	brat.	If	you	could	have	seen	her—that’s	all!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	already	the	spell	of	the	adventure	was	losing	strength;	already	the	breezy oxygen	of	Elsie’s	personality	was	replacing	the	delicate	intoxication	of	that	other presence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	suppose	it	must	be	something	of	the	sort,”	Alixe	admitted	reluctantly.	“There’s nothing	much	else	to	think,	is	there?	But	we	won’t	tell	a	living	soul,	Elsie!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	little	sister	promised	cheerfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	there	is	one	thing	more—I’ll	do	what	she	said	about	tomorrow.	I’ll	send that	Prince	boy	a	note	to-night	to	say	he	must	wait	till	afternoon.	If	he	won’t wait,	I	don’t	care.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	settles	how	much	you	do	care	for	the	Prince	boy,	anyway.”	remarked Elsie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	note	went,	and	next	morning	Alixe	waked,	late,	to	the	old	indecision.	What had	she	gained	by	putting	off	the	crisis	for	half	a	day?	How	had	she	been	so influenced	by	the	words	of	a	clever,	casual	stranger?	It	was	the	m�tier”	of	a whole	world	of	people	whom	she	had	only	read	about	to	charm	and	manipulate simple	persons.	She	had	come	in	contact	with	one	of	these,	and	had	been manipulated—that	was	all.	It	was	as	Elsie	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet,	even	as	she	thought	this,	the	memory	of	that	frank	and	high-bred	face	rose to	answer	the	thought.	However,—Alixe	tossed	her	arms	restlessly	above	her head	on	the	pillow	in	the	dim	quiet	of	her	room,—however,	there	was	nothing else	thinkable:	it	was	that.	She	insisted,	she	whispered	the	words	aloud:	“It	was that.”	And	the	Prince	was	still	to	be	answered	that	afternoon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	knock	at	the	door.	Elsie	with	mail—American	mail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Draw	up	the	shades,	Elsie	dear,	and	ring	for	my	breakfast.	I’m	glad	you	let	me sleep;	I	was	tired.	Oh,	what	a	lot	of	letters!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>She	sat	up	in	bed,	with	a	braid	over	her	shoulder,	and	a	blue	bow	much	on	one side	of	her	head.	She	slipped	the	letters	across	each	other.	“Betty	Ord;	and	that one’s	a	man—Bob	McLean,	I	think.”	(A	woman	prolongs	the	joy	of	the	postman like	this.)	“And	that’s	Aunt	Elizabeth—she’s	at	Saranac.	And	this	is	a	bill—oh, joy!	Why	do	bills—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stopped	short.	It	was	the	under	letter	of	the	pile.	All	the	other	letters, unopened,	slid	to	the	floor.	Elsie,	turning	from	the	window-shades,	saw. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alixe!	Has	something	happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alixe	held	out	the	under	letter—and	drew	it	back.	“Him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Him?	Who?	Oh!”	Elsie	was	on	her	knees	by	the	bed.	“Not—Jim	Arnold?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	why	don’t	you	open	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I—can’t.”	She	stared	at	the	big,	bold	black	writing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	open	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alixe	pushed	back	the	hand.	She	glanced	at	her	sister.	“I	should	say	not.”	Then she	slid	a	forefinger	inside	the	flap—and	stopped.	“It	stirs	me	all	up	again.	I	was getting	peaceful.	What’s	he	writing	for?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Read	it,	goose!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And,	while	she	read,	the	little	sister	knelt,	with	eyes	glued	on	her—eager, patient,	faithful,	like	a	good	little	sensible	dog	which	waits	the	master’s	erratic time	to	throw	a	bone.	There	was	only	a	short	page	of	the	vigorous,	unmistakable writing—Elsie	could	see	so	much	with	perfect	honor.	And	Alixe	must	have	read it	six	times	before	the	guardian	angel	remonstrated:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alixe,	aren’t	you	going	to	tell	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	that	the	blonde	braid	flapped	in	her	face	and	Alixe	was	hugging	her.	“Dear old	Elsie—good	little	Elsie!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>“Your	hair	is	in	my	mouth,	Alixe—brr!”	responded	Elsie	with	disgust.	“Let	me read	the	letter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!”	And	then,	“Why—I	think	you	could.	The	words	of	it	don’t	mean	much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Golly!”	remarked	Elsie,	taking	possession.	“What’s	all	the	fuss	about,	then? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	postage	stamp?”	She	read—aloud:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	man	doesn’t	deserve	anything	when	he	has	been	a	fool.	I	know	that.	But	once in	a	while	a	man	gets	what	he	doesn’t	deserve,	and	I’m	going	to	try.	Everything may	have	happened.	I	know	that,	too.	But	if	you	don	t	tell	me	not	to,	I’m coming.	Now.	This	letter	should	reach	you	Monday,	the	6th.	If	I	get	no	cable	I’ll sail	Wednesday,	the	8th.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	doesn’t	finish	up	very	gracefully,	does	it?”	inquired	Elsie.	“Sort	of	stops	in the	middle.”	And	she	bent	and	kissed	her	sister	in	a	motherly	way.	“He’s	a	fool, you	know.	He	said	so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alixe	clutched	her	letter.	“In	spots—yes,	he	is.	But,	you	see,	he	is	also—the Only	Man	in	the	World.”	And,	as	she	laughed,	holding	the	big	black	writing against	her	face,	suddenly	she	looked	up.	“Elsie,	the	lady	at	Versailles	yesterday: she	told	me—not	to	decide—till	afternoon.	And	here’s—his	letter.	How	did—</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elsie	considered.	“Ginger!”	she	acknowledged.	“Lucky	fluke,	I	call	it—those things	happen	sometimes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	long	years,	the	unending	years,	are	before	twenty.	That	mile-stone	passed, one	seems	to	have	got	beyond	the	signs	that	read—it	may	be	fancied—“Lives forbidden	to	go	faster	than	twelve	months	a	year.	By	order	of	the	Fates.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	has	got	to	the	open	country,	and	speeding	is	allowed.	And	at	first	it	is glorious	to	speed.	The	roads	are	green	and	gold	with	May	weather;	the	far landscape	is	a	mist	of	blossoming	trees.	The	breeze	exhilarates	as	we	rush forward	to	yet	more	freshness	and	color.	But	it	grows	dusty;	it	grows	hot;	hills loom	that	are	hard	to	climb;	the	wind	bites,	and	one	is	a	little	tired—and	the machine	goes	so	relentlessly	fast.	With	that,	there	are	places	of	shade	and rippling	water;	there	are	hands	stretched	from	the	wayside;	there	are	eyes	that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>shine	into	ours	with	a	new	look,	undreamed	of,	thrilling:	but	the	machine	whirls on.	For	sorrow	or	joy	we	may	not	wait.	The	merciless,	merciful	motor	of	the years	whirls	us	past	troubles	and	bliss	alike—the	machine	goes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alixe	was	twenty-two	on	the	morning	in	Paris	when	Elsie	brought	her	the American	mail.	There	was	no	answer	cabled,	but	there	was	an	answer	given	to the	Prince	that	afternoon,	in	an	interview	which,	to	the	honor	of	both,	left	them friends.	The	day	was	lived	through,	and	ten	days	more,	and	then	duly	arrived	the Only	Man	in	the	World,	and	crooked	paths	were	made	straight	and	dark	places made	light.	And	immediately,	with	no	regard	for	a	trousseau,	there	must	be	a wedding,	which	there	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	in	a	turn	of	the	hand	five	years	were	gone	and	she	was	back.	She	and	the man	were	back	in	Paris,	and	were	due	to	dine	at	the	gorgeous	great	house	of	the Prince	and	Princess.	For	it	was	out	of	all	drawing	that	the	Prince	boy	should	be unhappy	for	long.	Within	a	year	of	his	heartbreaking	a	girl	happened	along,—an American	girl,	which	prettily	connected	the	old	love	to	the	new,—and	the	Prince once	more	was	heels	over	head	in	love,	and	this	time	not	in	vain.	He	married	the girl	and	her	trillions	of	Western	money,	and	all	went	merry	as	a	marriage	bell; and	continued	to	go	fairly	merry,	as	things	are,	for	the	boy	and	girl	seemed	to have	only	one	trouble,	that	of	keeping	up	with	their	money;	which	is	a	trouble that	most	people	face	with	courage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alixe,	sitting	at	the	great	dinner-table,	regarded	the	Prince	with	that	mixture	of feelings	which	fogs	a	woman	in	like	case.	The	man	had	belonged	to	her—so	he had	said;	she	had	refused	him,	and	he	had	been	stricken;	now	he	was	happy	with another	woman.	She	wished	him	to	be	happy—yet	it	was	soothing	that	he	should seem	not	too	aggressively	happy.	The	slightly	harassed	look	in	the	flashing	dark eyes—Alixe	pleasantly	considered	whether	she	could	have	kept	that	look	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	then	the	woman	who	sat	next	spoke	to	her.	For	a	mishap	had	come	to	the feast	at	the	last	moment,	and	it	was	short	one	man,	so	that,	instead	of	a	black coat	on	either	side,	Alixe	had	on	her	left	a	graceful	person	in	lace	and	violets, with	gray	eyes	and	bright	color,	and	already,	at	thirty	or	so,	gray	hair.	A	piquant person—the	more	so	as	she	was	Irish.	In	the	speech	of	a	cultivated	Irishwoman, </p>
<p class="calibre1">—the	best	English	in	the	world,—with	the	full,	round	vowels,	and	the	clear consonants,	and	the	pretty	burr	of	strength	on	the	closing	of	the	syllables,	she made	a	most	unexpected	remark. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>“Please,”	she	threw	at	the	American	impulsively,	“please	let	me	look	at	your hands.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alixe,	smiling,—for	Miss	Daley	was	very	winning,—held	them	out.	The Irishwoman	examined	the	palms	eagerly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Tis	just	as	I	thought.”	The	two,	in	the	chatter	of	the	big	dinner-table,	were unnoticed	and	alone.	“I	was	right—just.	I	knew	‘twas	so	before	I	saw.”	And	she laughed,	with	eyes	and	dimples	and	radiant,	shifting	color	all	joining.	“I’ll	tell you	something	about	yourself	that	it’s	likely	you	don’t	know.	You’ve”—she hesitated	a	second—“you’ve	the	second	sight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What!”	Alixe	gasped.	“What	do	you	mean,	Miss	Daley?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse	me	for	being	so	blunt,	but	the	moment	I	saw	you	I	thought	it—there’s	a look;	I	could	hardly	wait	to	make	sure.”	She	gazed	seriously	at	the	young American	woman	with	her	bright	gray	eyes.	“Don’t	be	offended,”	she	said.	“It’s a	wonderful	gift.	I’ve	the	same	power,”	she	went	on,	“and	I’ve	had	experience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’ve	the	gift	of	seeing	things	that	most	people	are	not	aware	of.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	don’t	want	to,”	protested	Alixe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	don’t	say	that,”	the	pretty	Irishwoman	smiled	at	her.	“‘Twill	do	you	no harm.	‘Tis	only	another	open	door	to	life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	you’re	mistaken,”	Alixe	reasoned;	“for	I’ve	never	seen—ghosts,	or anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	sure?”	Miss	Daley	asked.	And	then,	“However	that	may	be,	you’ve	got the	power.	It	may	happen	to	do	you	good	sometime—for	that	depends	on yourself,	like	most	else.	And	I’m	sorry	indeed	if	I’ve	troubled	you—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	that	second	the	hostess’	voice	spoke	Alixe’s	name	from	the	farther	end	of	the table.	“I	wish	you	were	going	to	sail	with	us	tomorrow,”	she	said.	“Karl	is	so hard	to	amuse	when	he	gets	restless—I	dread	being	responsible	for	him	off	at sea.	And	he’s	always	amused	and	happy	when	you’re	about.	Do	come,	won’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Awfully	good	of	you,”	laughed	Alixe.	“What	an	enchanting	time	you’re	going to	have!	It	sounds	fairylike.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>The	Princess	looked	worried.	“I	hope	it	will	be	nice—I	suppose	so.	The	yacht	is Karl’s	new	toy,	and	he’s	mad	about	it,	for	the	moment.	But	he	has	such	a	lot	of toys—it’s	like	being	choked	with	flowers	and	candies.	They’re	nice,	you	know</p>
<p class="calibre1">—but	it’s	being	choked,	all	the	same.	We	don’t	have	time	to	enjoy	things	much, because	the	next	toy	has	to	be	played	with.	All	the	motors—we	haven’t	done much	with	them;	yet	Karl	thinks	we	ought	to	go	off	on	this	voyage,	and,	of course,	I	want	to	go,	too—I	wouldn’t	miss	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	one	spoke	from	down	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does	the	baby	go?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.”	The	worried	look	sharpened.	“She’s	only	three—she’s	too	young.	I	have to	leave	her	a	good	deal	because	of	the	automobiles	and	the	yacht	and	all	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	young	woman	laughed	a	bit	sadly.	“They’re	insistent,	and	the	baby	doesn’t insist.	They	don’t	give	me	a	chance	to	see	much	of	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	Alixe’s	mind	came	a	sentence	that	she	had	heard:	“When	one	has	always	new pleasures,	one	has	no	time	to	enjoy	any	pleasure;	one	has	no	time	to	enjoy	those who	are	dearest.”	It	came	to	her	who	had	said	the	words.	It	was	the Frenchwoman	whom	she	had	seen	once—once	only—in	the	park	at	Versailles, on	the	day	before	the	day	that	had	decided	for	her	all	history—on	the	fifth	of October,	five	years	ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Princess	had	lapsed	into	talk	with	the	grand	person	at	her	right,	and	Alixe turned	to	the	little	Irishwoman	who	had	startled	her.	But	at	this	end	of	the	long table	they	were	all	launched	on	a	common	subject.	Some	one	had	caught	a	word of	Miss	Daley’s,	and	that	had	started	it—psychological	research,	ghosts.	A	man was	finishing	a	story,	and	there	was	a	chorus:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	extraordinary!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	makes	me	shiver.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	an	Englishwoman,	a	Lady	Herristone,	caught	up	the	thread,	and	everybody listened,	as	everybody	always	will	listen	at	the	promise	of	a	ghost	story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	t	makes	me	think,”	she	said,	“of	something	I	heard	here	in	Paris	last	year.	I had	it	directly	from	one	of	the	people	to	whom	it	happened.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>“Tell	it!	Tell	it!”	she	was	urged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lady	Herristone	considered.	“I	was	trying	to	remember	the	exact	date,”	she	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“for	that	is	the	point.	Do	you	recollect	how,	at	the	time	of	the	Revolution,	the mob	marched	out	from	Paris	to	attack	Versailles?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	certainly,”	people	answered.	“Well,	when	the	Queen,	Marie	Antoinette, heard	that	news,	she	was	in	the	park	of	the	Petit	Trianon,	in	the	bameau,	the	little play	village—you	will	remember	that	also.	Word	was	brought	to	her	that	the palace	gates	were	about	to	be	attacked,	and	the	Queen	said,	‘My	place	is	with	the King,’	and	went	straight	to	him,	and	never	came	back	again	to	the	bameau.	That is—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lady	Herristone	paused.	She	had	a	dramatic	fashion	of	talking,	and	every	one	at the	table	was	watching	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	is—in	life.	For	they	say—and	people	whom	I	know	believe	this—they	say that,	on	the	anniversary	of	that	day	when	the	mob	marched	from	Paris,	the	last day	she	ever	spent	in	the	place	she	loved	best—on	that	day	the	Queen	walks	in the	park.	Every	year	some	one	meets	her	there,	and	talks	to	her,	but	is	always unconscious	of	who	it	is	until	afterward.	It	always	seems	to	the	persons	who meet	her	that	a	beautiful	Frenchwoman	in	fancy	dress	has	spoken	to	them—</p>
<p class="calibre1">that’s	all.	It’s	a	pretty	story,	isn’t	it?”	Lady	Herristone	appealed	to	the	dinner-table.	“And	it’s	true.	A	man	told	me	to	whom	it	happened.	There	are	many people	in	Paris	to-day	who	will	vouch	for	it.	This	man	believes	that	he	spoke, talked,	two	years	ago,	to	Queen	Marie	Antoinette.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	brilliant	company	faced	toward	her;	from	right,	from	left,	from	across,	the faces	bent	to	hers;	it	was	quite	still.	At	last	Alixe	spoke.	“What	day	is	it—the	day when	the	Queen	walks	in	the	park?”	she	asked	slowly,	and	her	voice	sounded strange. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	the	fifth	of	October,”	Lady	Herristone	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	from	across	the	table	Alixe’s	eyes	met	her	husband’s. </p>
