<p class="calibre1"><a id="p3"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	1</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	can’t	say	that	Friday,	April	13,	was	a	good	day	even	though	that’s	when	I	won the	lottery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	not	that	my	standards	are	too	high.	It	certainly	wasn’t	a	bad	day.	It	was	more like	a	complex	day:	That	Friday	took	my	simple	kid’s	life	and	made	it	as	knotty as	a	sweater	knit	by	a	squirrel	who	just	got	off	a	roller	coaster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’d	think	that	having	money	would	make	everything	easy.	If	you	get	grass stains	on	your	best	pants,	you	just	reach	into	your	closet	where	another	hundred pairs	hang.	If	you	can’t	decide	which	video	game	to	buy,	you	buy	them	both	and throw	another	dozen	into	the	shopping	cart…which	is	being	pushed	by	your butler.	But	being	rich	had	exactly	the	opposite	effect	on	me.	Maybe	it	was because	I	became	so	rich	so	suddenly.	Or	maybe	it	was	because	of	the	way	I became	rich.	Or	maybe	it	was	because	buying	pants	and	video	games	is	the	easy part. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or	maybe	it	was	because	…	Well,	it’s	a	long	story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	Monday	before	that	Friday	the	13th,	I	was	at	the	Pick-a-Chick.	That’s what	the	sign	said	outside,	although	it	wasn’t	really	a	Pick-a-Chick	anymore.	It was	Herb’s	This	‘n	That	Store.	I’m	only	thirteen,	and	I	can	name	three	other businesses	that	used	to	own	that	store.	First	it	was	McCardle’s	Milk,	which	was cool	because	they	had	Pop	Gums,	a	slime-green	ice	cream	bar	with	bubble	gum in	the	middle	of	it.	Then	it	was	Moishe’s	Meats,	which	pretty	much	put	it	off	my map	since	when	I	was	seven	I	was	unlikely	to	want	to	browse	in	a	butcher’s store	that	had	slabs	of	dead	cows	and	featherless	chickens	in	its	window	as	if that	would	really	draw	people	in.	I	think	that’d	be	true	even	if	I	weren’t	a vegetarian.	Then	it	was	The	Nickel	House,	which	sold	newspapers	and	comics and	other	things	that	cost	a	lot	more	than	a	nickel.	They	went	out	of	business, maybe	because	you	can’t	lie	in	your	store’s	name	and	expect	to	get	away	with	it for	long.	And	then	someone	named	Herb	bought	it	and	I	guess	gave	up	on	trying to	figure	out	what	he	would	be	selling,	so	it	became	the	This	‘n	That	Store, which	was	exactly	what	it	was.	But,	throughout	all	this	time,	the	old	Pick-a-Chick	sign	stayed	where	it	was,	running	the	long	way	up	the	side	of	the	brick building.	By	the	time	it	got	to	Herb,	the	Pick-a-Chick	sign	was	practically	a	local landmark.	So,	there	the	sign	hung	on	the	This	‘n	That	store	although	chicken	was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p4"></a>one	of	the	few	things	you	absolutely	couldn’t	get	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	parents	hadn’t	exactly	outlawed	Herb’s,	but	they	weren’t	crazy	about	my going	there	since	there	was	hardly	anything	in	there	that	was	Good	For	Me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Candy	but	no	fruit.	Comics	but	no	books.	Joke	soap	that	turns	your	hands	black but	no	ruled	notebook	paper.	So,	when	I	went,	I	tried	to	do	it	on	the	way	to somewhere	else	so	I	could	just	sort	of	sidle	on	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sidling	is	the	right	word	because	Herb	-	whoever	he	was	-	had	put	in	three	rows of	shelves	where	only	two	really	fit.	So	you	had	to	walk	sideways,	and	if	you	ran into	someone	in	the	same	aisle,	one	of	you	had	to	back	up	all	the	way	and	move down	another	aisle.	In	fact,	I	always	thought	it	cruel	that	Herb	put	the	diet	foods in	the	middle	of	one	of	the	aisles,	because	if	you	really	needed	them,	you probably	wouldn’t	be	able	to	fit	in	to	get	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	that’s	not	why	I	was	there	on	that	Monday.	My	violin	lesson	was	over	and	I thought	I	would	treat	myself	to	a	Ding	Dong	Doggie	before	walking	the	eight blocks	back	home.	You	know	you	have	to	really	like	Ding	Dong	Doggies	to	be willing	to	ask	for	one	by	name.	What	Ding	and	Dong	and	Doggie	had	to	do	with a	butterscotch	cake	with	vanilla	creme	insides	I’ll	never	know.	But	I	liked	them, and	so	I	sidled	on	in	to	the	Pick-a-Chick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	my	Ding	Dong	Doggie	-	please,	can	I	just	call	it	a	“triple	D”	from	now	on? </p>
<p class="calibre1">-	I	had	my	Triple	D	in	my	hand	and	headed	to	the	counter	to	pay	for	it.	But	there was	a	woman	ahead	of	me	buying	lottery	tickets.	She	had	filled	out	20	forms where	you	choose	what	number	you	want	to	bet	on,	and	Mrs.	Karchov	was typing	the	numbers	into	the	lottery	machine	on	the	counter.	One	by	one.	At	that rate,	before	I	got	home	I’d	be	old	enough	to	shave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	I	dug	my	hand	into	my	pocket	and	fished	for	coins.	But	a	Triple	D	costs	85</p>
<p class="calibre1">cents	-	and	is	worth	every	penny	-	and	who	ever	has	85	cents	in	coins?	If	I	did	I could	have	just	left	them	on	the	counter	and	showed	the	Triple	D	to	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karchov.	It’s	the	type	of	cutting	ahead	in	line	that	you’re	allowed	to	do,	at	least according	to	my	father	who	sometimes	pays	for	newspapers	that	way.	But,	since I	didn’t	have	the	coins,	all	I	could	do	is	leave	the	dollar	bill	I	had	clutched	in	my hand.	And	I’d	be	darned	if	I	was	going	to	pay	an	extra	fifteen	cents	for	a	Triple D.	Money	doesn’t	grow	on	trees	you	know.	(By	the	way,	neither	do	anvils.	And it’s	a	good	thing.)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p5"></a>So,	I	waited.	And	waited.	And	Mrs.	Karchov	typed	and	typed.	And	I	watched	the lady	in	front	of	me.	She	was	older	than	my	mother	but	not	as	old	as	my grandmother.	Somewhere	in	between.	But	nothing	else	was	in-between	about her.	She	was	built	like	the	original	Starship	Enterprise:	not	very	high,	very	wide, and,	because	of	her	hat,	flat	on	top.	Without	her	hat,	she	wouldn’t	have	looked very	much	like	a	starship	at	all.	The	hat	was	round	like	a	pancake	with	a	double pat	of	butter	on	top.	It	was	blue,	like	the	color	of	fake	blueberry	syrup.	It	looked like	it	was	made	out	of	some	sort	of	shiny	plastic	that	was	sticky	the	way	your fingers	are	when	you’re	done	with	your	pancakes.	In	fact,	the	whole	thing looked	like	maybe	she’d	gotten	it	at	the	International	House	of	Bad	Hats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	the	woman	seemed	a	bit	nervous	or	unsure	of	herself.	She	kept	muttering apologies	and	politenesses	like,	“Here’s	another,	if	you	don’t	mind,”	and	“I’m sorry	to	be	such	a	bother,”	and	“I	do	appreciate	all	your	help.”	And	after	about every	third	ticket	was	typed	in,	she’d	turn	to	me	and	half	smile	to	let	me	know she	felt	bad	about	holding	me	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	thing	was	that	she	didn’t	have	to	make	Mrs.	Karchov	do	all	that	typing.	The lottery	machine	in	the	store	is	a	computer	and	it’s	perfectly	happy	to	choose numbers	for	you.	There’s	no	reason	to	pick	your	own	numbers,	unless	you	think that	you	have	some	type	of	direct	connection	to	the	bouncing	balls	they	use	to pick	the	winning	numbers	every	week.	The	only	thing	picking	your	own numbers	does	is	make	Mrs.	Karchov	stand	there	and	type	them	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	know	about	this	because	my	dad	is	the	type	of	parent	who	doesn’t	just	tell	you not	to	do	something	but	has	to	explain	to	you	every	detail	of	what	it	is	that you’re	not	supposed	to	do.	For	example,	when	he	told	me	not	to	pour	paint remover	down	the	sink	after	washing	out	the	brushes	I’d	used	to	decorate	a model	car,	he	didn’t	just	tell	me	not	to,	he	also	told	me	everything	human	beings have	learned	about	the	effect	of	flammable	solutions	on	the	environment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	when	he	told	me	not	to	play	the	lottery,	I	also	learned	everything	known	to science	about	it.	Oh,	this	was	a	rich	topic	for	Dad.	It	took	most	of	the	trip	to overnight	camp	-	a	three	hour	drive	-	for	me	to	find	out	exactly	how	lotteries work,	their	effect	on	the	economy,	their	history	throughout	the	ages,	and	why they	are	evil.	As	a	result,	I	knew	more	about	the	lottery	than	I	learned	about	U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">history	in	an	entire	year	of	seventh	grade.	(No	offense,	Mr.	Saperstein!) Too	bad	the	woman	ahead	of	me	didn’t	know	what	I	knew.	If	she	did,	she</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p6"></a>wouldn’t	be	playing	the	lottery	at	all,	or	else	she’d	have	just	let	the	machine	pick her	numbers	for	her.	And	my	entire	amazing	experience	wouldn’t	have happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or	if	I’d	just	been	willing	to	give	up	the	fifteen	cents,	I	would	have	slapped	the dollar	on	the	counter	and	been	on	my	semi-merry	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	no,	I	waited	while	Mrs.	Karchov	typed	and	the	woman	ahead	of	me	kept looking	at	me	apologetically.	And	finally,	the	woman	was	done.	Almost.	She paid	for	her	lottery	tickets	with	a	crisp	twenty	dollar	bill.	And,	then,	at	the	last minute,	when	I	thought	my	turn	had	finally	come,	she	remembered	she	had	also bought	a	bag	of	buttons.	She	pulled	it	out	of	the	pocket	of	her	orange	jacket,	and said,	“Oh	my!	I	almost	walked	out	of	here	without	paying	for	these!”	Another two	dollars	changed	hands,	and	at	long	last	the	woman	was	done.	Nothing	stood between	me	and	my	Triple	D	except	handing	Mrs.	Karchov	my	dollar	bill	and getting	my	change	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	placed	the	bill	on	the	counter	and	heard	the	sound	of	about	a	hundred	little	taps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	even	looking	I	knew	the	lady	had	dropped	the	bag	of	buttons.	“Oh	my!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	floor	was	polka-dotted	with	buttons.	“Let	me	help,”	said	I,	for	I	happen	to be	a	nice	boy…you	can	ask	anyone.	The	woman	barely	fit	in	the	Pick-a-Chick	at all,	and	there	was	no	way	she	was	going	to	be	able	to	squat	and	pick	up	the buttons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	down	I	went	on	my	knees,	and	gathered	the	buttons,	at	first	several	at	a	time, and	then,	as	they	became	harder	to	find,	one	by	one.	And	I	did	a	good	job.	Some were	obvious,	but	others	had	skittered	under	shelves	like	mice	afraid	of	a	cat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	peered	and	bent	and	twisted	and	felt	until	I	thought	I	had	them	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you	so	much,”	the	woman	said	over	and	over	again	as	I	hunted	down	the buttons.	And	when	I	was	done,	she	said,	“You	really	are	the	kindest	boy.	Your parents	must	be	very	proud	of	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	ma’am,”	I	said	because	it	seemed	like	the	sort	of	thing	a	kind	boy	would say,	especially	if	his	parents	were	very	proud	of	him.	In	fact,	I	think	it	was probably	the	first	and	only	time	I	ever	called	anyone	“ma’am.”	The	truth	is,	all	I could	think	about	was	getting	my	Triple	D	and	rushing	on	home	before	my parents	started	picking	a	photo	for	the	“Have	you	seen	…”	posters	they’d	be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a>putting	on	the	telephone	poles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here,”	she	said,	“you	must	take	one	of	these	as	a	reward,”	handing	me	the	top lottery	ticket	in	her	pile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I	couldn’t,”	I	said,	thinking	about	the	expression	on	my	parents’	faces	if	I came	home	not	only	late	but	with	a	lottery	ticket	in	my	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	you	really	must,”	she	said,	handing	it	to	me.	And	being	a	nice	boy,	and	a kind	boy,	and	a	boy	who	really	wanted	to	eat	a	Ding	Ding	Doggie,	I	said,	“OK. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thank	you	very	much.”	And,	without	thinking	much	about	it,	I	opened	my	violin case	a	crack	and	shoved	the	ticket	into	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	if	you	win,”	said	the	woman,	“you	can	think	of	me	as	your	fairy godmother.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you.	Goodbye,”	I	said,	in	a	pretend	cheerful	voice.	But	what	I	was thinking	was,	“Yeah,	and	the	day	I	win	the	lottery	will	be	the	same	day	I’ll	think that	my	sister	Maddie	is	fun	to	be	with	and,	oh	yeah,	pigs	can	fly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	just	shows	you	how	wrong	you	can	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	2</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	think	about	the	ticket	again	until	Tuesday	night.	After	all,	everyone knows	that	if	you	have	a	violin	lesson	on	Monday,	you	don’t	have	to	practice until	twenty-four	hours	later.	Even	parents	understand	this.	It’s	practically	a	law. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	of	course,	I	didn’t	open	my	violin	case	until	Tuesday	night.	I	had	just finished	my	math	homework	and	figured	I’d	get	my	violin	practicing	over	with. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	turned	out	to	be	lucky	for	me	for	two	reasons.	First,	it	meant	that	I	opened up	my	case	in	my	room,	instead	of	in	the	den	where	I	usually	practice,	so	that when	the	lottery	ticket	fluttered	out,	no	one	saw	it	but	me.	Second,	having	just finished	working	on	math	problems	put	me	in	the	right	frame	of	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	just	been	busting	my	brain	on	those	problems	where	you	have	to	figure	out what	the	next	number	is	by	catching	on	to	the	pattern	in	the	numbers	before	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	example,	if	the	series	were	1,3,7,15	the	next	number	would	be	31	because between	1	and	3	is	2,	and	between	3	and	7	is	4,	and	between	7	and	15	is	8,	so you	keep	multiplying	the	difference	by	two	and	adding	it.	And	that	turns	out	to be	the	same	thing	as	multiplying	by	two	and	adding	one.	How	almost interesting! </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	when	the	lottery	ticket	floated	off	of	my	violin	and	fluttered	down	to	the floor,	for	the	first	time	I	saw	the	number	that	the	hat	lady	had	picked.	35-8-27-9-18-9.	Now,	normally	I	have	a	real	hard	time	with	these	types	of	problems,	but this	one	I	got	right	away,	even	though	there	was	no	reason	to	think	there	was anything	to	get.	Maybe	that’s	why	I	got	it.	Or	maybe	it	was	just	that	I	noticed that	the	digits	of	the	first	number	-	35	-	added	up	to	the	second	number.	And, then,	while	I	was	at	it,	I	noticed	that	if	you	subtract	the	second	number	from	the first	one	-	35	minus	8	-	you	get	the	third	number.	And,	wouldn’t	you	know	it,	if you	add	the	digits	of	the	third	number,	you	get	the	fourth.	And	if	you	subtract	the fourth	from	the	third,	you	get	the	fifth.	And	if	you	add	the	digits	of	the	fifth,	you get	the	sixth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Coincidence?	Maybe.	If	you	look	hard	enough	at	any	series	you	can	begin	to find	some	ways	they	work	out.	But	this	was	too	neat.	The	woman	in	the	Pick-a-Chick	must	have	had	her	own	twisted	mathematical	mind	working	overtime	in picking	her	numbers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>But	I	had	more	important	things	to	worry	about:	I	had	to	finish	my	violin practicing	in	time	to	be	able	to	watch	 <i class="calibre3">The	Simpsons</i>	rerun	on	TV.	So,	I	put	the ticket	back	in	my	violin	case	and	got	to	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	there	it	stayed	…	until	the	next	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	in	the	den,	playing	Commander	Keen	on	the	kids’	computer.	Keen’s	an	old game,	but	it’s	a	real	time	waster	and	because	there’s	no	blood	and	gore,	my parents	practically	encourage	me	to	play	it.	My	mother	was	sitting	at	the	roll-top desk,	going	over	the	bills,	opening	envelopes	and	shaking	her	head.	And	in comes	my	sister	Maddie,	holding	the	ticket,	and	saying,	“What’s	this?”	all innocently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maddie,	you	have	to	understand,	is	five	years	old	and	enough	to	drive	any brother	insane.	She’s	the	worst	variety	of	cute:	the	type	that’s	cute	and	knows	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	she	has	to	do	is	pull	her	little	lower	lip	under	her	upper	one	and	look	at	her shoes	and	shuffle	her	feet,	and	you	can	practically	hear	a	crowd	say	“Awww.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	she	gets	what	she	wants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	that	there’s	anything	really	wrong	with	that.	I’d	do	it	too,	if	I	could	get	away with	it.	But,	Maddie	seemed	to	me	to	be	doing	it	more	and	more,	as	if recognizing	that	she	was	only	about	a	birthday	away	from	it	not	working	for	her anymore.	You	had	to	give	her	credit.	She	was	milking	it	for	all	it	was	worth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	out	of	my	seat	in	a	flash,	thinking	about	how	to	explain	how	I	ended	up with	the	ticket	when,	to	my	amazement,	my	mother	actually	ignored	Maddie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	telephone	rang,	and	Mom	was	annoyed	enough	about	being	interrupted while	working	on	the	bills	that	she	went	for	the	phone	to	stop	it	from	ringing	as if	it	were	a	chipmunk	she	had	to	chase	out	of	the	house.	So,	while	Mom	was	on the	phone	with	someone	trying	to	sell	her	another	credit	card	-	I	pity	the	poor slob	on	the	other	end	of	the	line	-	I	was	in	Maddie’s	face	and	had	grabbed	the ticket	from	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	what	is	it?”	she	asked.. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	tell	you	later.	Now	just	keep	quiet	or	I’ll	tell	Mom	you	were	playing	with my	violin	again.”	Quickly	shoving	the	ticket	into	my	pocket,	I	went	back	to Keen,	Maddie	wandered	back	to	her	room,	and	my	mother	hung	up	on	the	guy from	the	credit	card	company	with	an	evil	smirk	on	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>That	night,	Maddie	came	into	my	room	to	borrow	my	good	markers.	There	was	a reason	why	they	were	mine	and	not	Maddie’s.	They	were	permanent.	Real permanent.	I’d	scientifically	proved	this	when	I	was	five	and	decided	that	the living	room	couch	would	look	much	better	with	a	picture	of	our	dog	on	it.	Eight years	later	our	dog	was	gone,	the	couch	was	in	the	“recreation	room”	in	the basement,	and	my	lovely	drawing	was	still	there	in	all	its	original	color. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Permanently.	(By	the	way,	you	may	be	able	to	figure	out	why	we	call	the recreation	room	the	“wreck”	room	for	short.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	I	said	to	Maddie,	“you	know	you’re	not	supposed	to	use	these	markers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	have	to	color	in	a	picture	for	school	tomorrow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	what’s	wrong	with	yours?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	stink,”	she	whined.	Normally	I	would	have	corrected	her	language,	not because	I	really	care	about	the	word	“stink”	but	because	it’s	my	obligation	as	an older	brother	to	be	as	annoying	as	possible.	But	her	markers	really	did	stink.	The yellow	stank	like	old	bananas,	the	brown	like	fake	chocolate,	the	red	like	cherry-flavored	cough	medicine.	Her	markers	 <i class="calibre3">really</i>	stank.	Plus,	they	didn’t	draw	very well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you	get	a	single	dot	on	anything	except	the	paper,	I’m	the	one	who’ll	be blamed.	And	I’ll	take	it	out	on	you,”	I	promised.	I	got	down	the	marker	set	and, holding	it	just	out	of	her	reach,	added,	“Want	them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I	just	said	that.”	She	grabbed	for	them	but	I	was	faster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Want	them?	Want	them?”	Oh,	I	was	being	a	real	jerk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	be	careful”	she	pleaded,	trying	to	jump	up	to	reach	the	markers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	you	will.	But	when	five-year-olds	are	careful,	somehow	the	rug	ends	up with	marker	marks	in	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	me	use	them!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope.	I’m	not	going	to	take	the	blame	for	when	you	make	a	mistake	and	write your	name	on	the	rug.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>“Give	me	the	markers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or	what?	You’ll	bite	my	ankles?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or	I’ll	tell	Mom	and	Dad	that	you	bought	a	lottery	ticket.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	that	got	a	fast	reaction	from	me.	I	pushed	the	markers	further	back	on	my highest	shelf.	“Definitely	not,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“OK,	then	I’m	going	to	tell	anyways.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	have	to	admit,	Maddie	knew	how	to	fight.	Of	course,	she	learned	everything she	knew	from	me.	That’s	the	problem	with	being	the	oldest	-	all	the	brilliant techniques	you	invented	are	stolen	by	the	ones	who	come	after	you.	It’s	the	price of	being	a	pioneer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	I	thought	for	a	moment.	There	was	really	only	one	way	to	absolutely	force Maddie	to	keep	the	lottery	ticket	a	secret.	“Maddie,”	I	said,	“I’ll	tell	you	what. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	going	to	give	you	a	great	deal.	Bargain	of	a	lifetime.	Shut	up	about	the ticket,	and	not	only	will	I	lend	you	my	markers,	but	I’ll	let	you	share	my	ticket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ninety-ten.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	poor	thing	hadn’t	gotten	to	percentages	yet	in	school.	“That	means	that	if	I win,	I’ll	give	you	ten	cents	out	of	every	dollar	that	I	win.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll	give	me	ten	cents?”	She	seemed	happy	enough	with	the	ten	pennies,	but I	didn’t	feel	like	I	could	really	cheat	her	that	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	exactly.	I’ll	give	you	ten	cents	for	every	dollar	I	win.	So,	if	I	win	thirty dollars,	I’ll	give	you	three	dollars	and	I’ll	keep	27	dollars.	And	if	I	win	a hundred	dollars,	I’ll	give	you	ten	dollars	and	I’ll	keep	ninety	dollars.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	going	to	give	me	ten	dollars?”	This	was	just	about	beyond	her comprehension. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	but	only	if	the	ticket	wins	a	hundred	dollars.	Never	mind,	just	believe	me that	it’s	a	great	deal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>“I’m	going	to	get	ten	dollars!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	created	a	monster.	Somehow	now	she	believed	that	not	only	was	I	lending her	the	markers,	but	I	was	going	to	fork	over	ten	bucks.	I	gave	it	one	last	try:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	only	if	the	lottery	ticket	wins.	If	it	doesn’t	win,	neither	of	us	will	get	any dollars	at	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ten	dollars!”	she	said,	as	I	handed	her	the	marker	set.	But	I	could	tell	that	she understood.	Now	she	was	being	the	jerk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	at	least	now	she	was	my	partner	in	crime	and	wouldn’t	go	blabbing	to	our parents	-	not	if	it	was	going	to	cost	her	ten	dollars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	confident	that	my	secret	was	safe	-	because	now	it	was	 <i class="calibre3">our</i>	secret	-	I	tucked the	ticket	back	into	my	violin	case	and	began	practicing	“A	Sailor’s	Shanty”	over and	over	and	over	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	3</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Life	at	Horace	J.	Oakes	Middle	School	is	far	more	complex	than	most	people realize.	It’s	a	school	where	popularity	counts	more	than	just	about	anything.	You could	be	the	captain	of	the	hockey	team,	a	straight	A	student,	great	looking,	and the	star	of	this	year’s	play	-	 <i class="calibre3">The	Music	Man</i>,	in	case	you	were	wondering	-	but	if word	got	out	that	you	were	unpopular,	well,	you	might	as	well	find	a	cave	with cable	TV	because	you’re	not	going	to	be	doing	a	lot	else	with	your	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	course,	if	you	were	all	those	things,	you’d	probably	be	popular	too.	But	that’s the	thing	-	it’s	only	a	probability.	Popularity	is	one	of	those	things	that’s	hard	to judge,	like	trying	to	decide	if	you’re	good	looking	by	staring	into	a	mirror.	You just	can’t	tell.	You	can	tell	if	you’re	smart	by	looking	at	a	report	card	(at	least kind	of),	and	you	can	tell	if	you’re	a	good	athlete	by	seeing	how	fast	you	run	a race,	but	popularity	is	hard	to	measure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	it’s	also	a	little	bit	like	being	a	celebrity	who’s	famous	just	for	being famous.	Once	word	gets	out	that	you’re	popular,	well	then,	you’re	popular.	But	if you’re	popular	and	no	one	knows	it,	then	you’re	not	really	popular.	You	can’t say,	“I’m	popular,	although	everyone	disagrees,”	any	more	than	you	can	say, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	famous,	but	no	one	knows	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mind	if	I	change	the	subject?	I’m	beginning	to	get	a	headache	…</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway,	the	truth	is	that	I	could	not	claim	to	be	one	of	the	most	popular	kids	in school.	It’s	not	that	if	you	were	to	divide	the	school	into	two	teams,	The Populars	and	the	Unpopulars,	I	would	be	made	the	captain	of	the	Unpops.	In fact,	you’d	really	have	to	make	a	third	team,	the	Who	Cares,	and	then	I	definitely would	be	on	the	starting	line	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	beats	me	why	that	is.	I’m	not	the	irritating	sort	of	kid	who	tries	to	get	people	to notice	him	by	hanging	upside	down	on	the	jungle	gym	in	the	playground	until the	change	drops	out	of	his	pockets	and	his	face	turns	red,	and	his	shirt	has	fallen so	that	his	flabby	belly	is	on	display,	and	drool	starts	dribbling	from	his	mouth, and	he’s	yelling,	“I’m	Bat	Boy!	I’m	Bat	Boy!”	No,	that’s	not	me.	That’s	my	best friend	Ari. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	just	get	along	with	most	everyone	and	am	especially	liked	by	just	about	no	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>But	at	the	beginning	of	the	school	year,	I	figured	out	a	way	to	fix	all	that.	Since you’re	popular	if	people	think	you’re	popular,	Ari	and	I	decided	to	create	a	club for	popular	people.	It	was	a	very	exclusive	club.	Invitation	only	-	and	secret.	The only	two	known	members	were	Ari	and	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	called	it	“The	Scutters	Society”	because	“Scutters”	didn’t	mean	anything	but sounded	kind	of	cool	-	sort	of	like	the	word	“popular.”	The	Scutters	Society	had a	secret	meeting	place,	secret	meetings,	secret	activities,	and	secret	members. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	course	there	wasn’t	really	any	such	thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	we	started	dropping	hints	about	it.	I	printed	up	a	notice	of	an	upcoming meeting,	and	then	crumpled	it	and	left	it	in	the	hallway	near	a	garbage	can, hoping	someone	would	notice	it	and	read	it.	Not	even	Mr.	Carbone	did	when	he picked	it	up	and	threw	it	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wrote	up	the	minutes	of	a	meeting	and	left	it	in	a	desk	in	study	hall	so	that	the next	occupant	would	find	it.	The	minutes	referred	to	members	by	code	names that	I	hoped	would	be	obvious	to	anyone	who	read	it.	For	example,	Joel	Hess (captain	of	the	soccer	team	and	immensely	popular	-	and	obnoxious)	was	“Jewel Heist”	and	Kathy	Picatino	(fluent	in	French,	awesomely	beautiful	-	and obnoxious)	was	“Café	Pick-a-Time-o.”	Ok,	so	it	wasn’t	so	subtle,	but	the	whole point	was	for	the	names	to	be	understood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	I	sent	in	an	anonymous	tip	to	Louellen	Parness	who	writes	a	gossip	column for	the	Oakes	Observer,	our	school	paper.	“Pop	Quiz:	What	is	the	secret	Scutters Society	all	about?”	she	wrote.	“And	just	how	popular	do	you	have	to	be	to	get in?	Give	yourself	a	B	if	you	answer:	Very.	But	give	yourself	an	A	if	you	didn’t even	have	to	ask.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	turned	out	to	be	just	about	as	dumb	as	it	sounds.	No	one	noticed,	or	if	they did,	they	didn’t	care.	Popular	kids	don’t	have	to	have	secret	societies.	And	even if	people	had	noticed,	they	wouldn’t	have	associated	me	and	Ari	with	it	because, as	I	may	have	mentioned,	we’re	not	popular. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	by	this	time	of	the	year,	I	had	not	only	lost	interest	in	it,	I	was	embarrassed about	it.	But	not	Ari.	He	wanted	to	have	meetings	and	was	talking	about	running for	vice	president. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	Thursday,	though,	he	wasn’t	asking	for	a	meeting.	He	had	a	different	idea. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>He	wanted	to	form	a	rock	and	roll	band	called	-	guess	what?	-	The	Scutters.	And I	had	agreed	to	try	it	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	see,	although	I	struggle	along	with	the	violin,	I’m	actually	an	OK	guitar player,	without	any	lessons.	My	mother	plays	-	she	was	in	a	rock	band	when	she was	in	high	school,	which	I	cannot	possibly	picture	-	so	it	was	easy	for	me	to pick	it	up.	If	you	never	heard	me	play	violin,	you	might	almost	think	that	I	have some	musical	talent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	father	drove	me	to	Ari’s	house	for	the	first	rehearsal	of	The	Scutters	because it	would	have	been	be	a	little	hard	to	fit	my	guitar	and	amplifier	in	my	bike basket.	When	I	got	there,	Ari	was	already	banging	away	at	his	drums	in	his garage,	and	Mimi	was	playing	bass.	The	result	some	might	call	progressive	jazz and	others	might	call	modern	music.	I’d	call	it	just	plain	bad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	that’s	ok.	It	was	our	first	rehearsal	and	the	guitar	player	-	me	-	hadn’t	even plugged	in	yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimi	was	my	oldest	friend.	In	fact,	she	was	such	an	old	friend	that	“friend”	isn’t even	the	right	word.	Mimi	and	I	were	in	the	same	playgroup	when	we	were twelve	months	old.	When	my	Mom	had	to	run	out	to	take	Maddie	to	the emergency	room	to	have	a	shell	from	a	Captain	Galactica	Thermo	Nuclear	Ray Gun	rocket	extracted	from	her	nose,	she	called	Marcie,	Mimi’s	mom,	to	watch over	me.	When	Marcie	had	an	extra	ticket	for	the	Ice-O-Rama	traveling	skating extravaganza,	it	was	natural	for	her	to	offer	to	take	me.	In	fact,	at	the	beginning of	second	grade,	my	mother	actually	let	Marcie	take	me	and	Mimi	shopping	for clothes.	Now	that’s	trust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	I	didn’t	feel	too	bad	when	I	laughed	in	her	face	when	I	saw	her	sitting	on Ari’s	little	brother’s	tricycle,	dressed	in	pink	shorts,	red	sneakers,	and	a	purple tee	shirt	that	said	“Just	Say	Huh?”	-	the	very	picture	of	a	rock	‘n	roll	queen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	didn’t	play	too	much	music	that	first	rehearsal.	We	spent	most	of	the	time doing	the	basics:	tuning	our	instruments,	trying	to	get	Ari	to	play	softer,	and arguing	over	the	name	of	our	first	album	-	Ari	liked	“Meet	the	Scutters,”	Mimi liked	“The	Scutters	Second	Album”	and	I	personally	preferred	“The	Scutters	Cut One.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	end	of	the	rehearsal,	Mimi	brushed	her	bangs	out	of	her	eyes	and	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	that	was	sort	of	fun,”	and	we	all	agreed.	Actually,	it	sort	of	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>And	who	knows?	If	the	Scutters	actually	became	a	popular	band,	wouldn’t	the three	members	of	the	Scutters	themselves	have	to	become	popular?	Maybe	The Scutters	Society,	in	its	own	way,	was	going	to	put	us	into	the	world	of	the popular. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or	so	it	seemed	the	day	before	I	won	the	lottery. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	4</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Friday	was	press	day	for	my	father.	He	publishes	the	local	newspaper	that	comes out	once	a	week.	For	the	longest	time	I	thought	he	hated	it	because	whenever	he talked	about	it,	he	was	complaining:	The	local	businesses	weren’t	advertising, the	ones	who	advertised	weren’t	paying,	the	local	residents	weren’t	subscribing, the	reporters	weren’t	reporting.	One	complaint	after	another,	sometimes	for	an entire	dinner	or	Sunday	morning	walk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	when	I	asked	him	a	few	years	ago	why	he	didn’t	quit,	he	looked	shocked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quit??	Jake,	I	love	 <i class="calibre3">The</i>	 <i class="calibre3">Gaz</i>.	I	wouldn’t	do	anything	else!”	( <i class="calibre3">The	Gaz</i>	was	short for	 <i class="calibre3">The	Melville	Gazette</i>.)	“Why	would	you	ask	such	a	thing?”	When	I	told	him that	all	I	ever	heard	from	him	were	complaints,	you	could	see	it	sink	in.	After that,	my	father	did	a	terrible	job	trying	to	be	positive	about	 <i class="calibre3">The	Gaz</i>	around	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	cute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fridays	are	tense	days	for	my	dad	because	that’s	the	day	the	paper	actually	gets printed.	It	means	he	has	to	go	to	the	printing	plant	to	oversee	the	production.	But it’s	also	the	last	chance	to	discover	and	fix	any	last	minute	problems	-	and	to	find out	that	you	made	mistakes	that	now	you	can’t	fix	because	the	paper’s	been printed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	at	dinner	on	Friday,	when	my	mom	asks	how	Dad’s	day	was,	it’s	not	like	the other	days	where	you	just	expect	a	“Fine”	that	doesn’t	mean	anything.	On Friday,	Dad’s	answer	tells	us	what	the	mood	of	dinner	and	of	the	weekend	will be	like. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tonight,	we	got	“Well,	it’s	done,	anyway,”	which	long	years	of	listening	to	my father	have	taught	me	means:	“Rough	day,	but,	in	the	end	the	newspaper	turned out	fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	seems	that	at	the	last	minute,	Dad	had	to	drop	an	article	from	the	front	page because	the	town	committee	on	recycling	hadn’t	met,	so	there	was	nothing	to report	about.	“So,	I	pulled	my	editorial	about	lotteries	onto	the	front	page.	I	don’t like	putting	editorials	on	the	front	page,	but	it	was	the	only	thing	that	would	fit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">(It’s	always	surprising	to	me	to	find	out	that	what	goes	on	the	front	page	of	a newspaper	can	depend	on	things	like	what	article	is	the	right	length	instead	of purely	on	what’s	most	important.	Another	illusion	shattered.)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>“This	is	the	last	in	the	series,	isn’t	it?”	my	mother	asked	as	my	Dad	served	her oven	roasted	potatoes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yup.	Which	makes	more	sense	than	putting	one	in	the	middle	of	the	series	on the	front	page.	In	this	last	one,	I	summarize	all	the	others.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	suddenly	lost	interest	in	the	potatoes,	normally	one	of	my	favorite	foods.	The front	page	announcement	that	my	father	hates	the	lottery	while	I	had	a	lottery ticket	ticking	upstairs	was	making	me	uncomfortable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	read	Dad’s	editorials	on	the	topic.	My	Dad	is	a	good	writer,	I’ll	give	him	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	I	can’t	say	I	really	disagreed	with	him.	Here	are	his	reasons: First,	the	lottery	was	created	to	take	the	money	poor	people	were	spending	on illegal	gambling	-	a	daily	game	called	“the	numbers”	-	and	have	that	money come	to	the	state	government	instead	of	to	organized	crime.	So,	the	lottery started	out	as	a	way	for	the	government	to	act	like	criminals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Second,	the	lottery	is	a	fool’s	game.	The	odds	against	winning	are	so	large	that	if you	bet	every	day	of	your	life,	your	chances	of	coming	out	ahead	in	the	end	were about	the	same	as	the	chance	that	you’d	be	hit	by	a	pink	car	driven	by	a	clown named	Moe.	You’d	be	far	better	off	putting	the	same	amount	of	money	into	a bank	every	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Third,	the	lottery	is	played	more	by	poor	people	than	by	rich	people,	yet	the money	the	state	makes	is	spread	evenly	across	all	the	towns.	That	means	poor towns	end	up	with	less	money	than	they	started	with.	My	Dad	calls	this	a	“tax	on the	poor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fourth,	it	encourages	people	to	gamble.	All	the	lottery	advertisements	make gambling	sound	like	fun	and	a	way	to	get	rich	quick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fifth,	it’s	an	inappropriate	way	to	pay	for	educational	programs	(which	is	where the	money	the	state	makes	goes).	Educational	programs	shouldn’t	have	to depend	on	people	gambling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	father	wasn’t	a	fanatic	about	this.	He	actually	was	reasonable	on	the	topic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	just	didn’t	always	act	that	way.	Once	you	got	him	started,	he	could	go	on	for hours.	His	face	would	redden,	his	eyebrows	would	tie	themselves	in	a	knot,	and he’d	lean	into	whoever	he	was	talking	with	as	if	he	were	just	waiting	for	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>chance	to	tell	him	why	they	were	all	wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	don’t	think	there	was	any	other	topic	my	father	felt	this	way	about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Which	is	why	the	editorial	ended	up	on	the	front	page. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	first	two	parts	of	the	series	he’d	been	writing	had	gotten	a	lot	of	people	to send	in	letters,	mainly	disagreeing	with	him.	Being	a	fair	person,	he	had	printed them	all	in	the	Letters	to	the	Editor	section	-	except	one	that	began	“Dear	Jerk-faced	Weasel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	what	the	lottery	is	worth	this	week?”	my	father	asked	with	just	a little	bitterness.	“Over	100	million	dollars.	A	hundred	million	dollars!	Can	you believe	it?	When	I	drove	home,	I	saw	a	line	coming	out	of	the	Pick-a-Chick store.	People	lining	up	to	buy	their	tickets,	last	minute.	Poor	suckers.	They	might as	well	just	put	their	dollar	bills	into	the	trash	can	in	front	of	the	store	and	skip the	line.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	ask	him	if	he	saw	a	woman	there	who	looked	like	the	Starship Enterprise.	And	I	decided	right	after	supper	to	make	sure	that	my	ticket	was	still safely	hidden	in	my	violin	case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	we	made	it	through	dinner,	and	I	practiced	violin	(and	checked	on	my	ticket), and	then	spent	an	hour	working	on	some	songs	for	The	Scutters.	In	other	words, it	was	turning	into	a	normal	Friday	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	normal	Friday	routine	is	that	I’m	allowed	to	stay	up	until	eleven	to	watch my	favorite	program,	a	medical	detective	show	-	although,	the	truth	is	that	I wouldn’t	like	the	program	nearly	so	much	if	it	didn’t	give	me	an	excuse	to	stay up	until	eleven.	Then	I	go	off	to	bed	and	my	parents	watch	the	local	news	on channel	5. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Between	my	show	and	the	start	of	the	news,	channel	5	televises	the	drawing	of the	state	lottery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having	stayed	up	through	the	credits	of	my	show,	on	the	grounds	that	the	credits are	legally	a	part	of	the	show,	we	were	still	engaged	in	the	standard	good	night chit	chat	when	the	sparkly	toothed	Ginny	Wombach	came	on	screen	to	announce the	winner.	Behind	her	was	a	machine	that	jumbled	40	numbered	ping	pong	balls as	if	they	were	stuck	in	a	berserk	popcorn	popper. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>“Well,	you’d	better	be	turning	in,	Jake,”	said	my	father	as	the	first	number jumped	out	of	the	tumbler	and	was	announced	by	the	ever-smiling	Ginny.	It	was 35.	So	far	so	good!	But,	I	realized	the	odds	of	the	next	one	being	an	eight	-	my next	number	-	were	39	to	one.	There	were	39	ways	the	wrong	number	could come	up,	and	just	one	way	the	right	one	could.	And	that’d	be	true	for	the	next five	numbers.	The	odds	were	ridiculously	bad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	getting	that	first	one	right	sure	got	my	attention!	So	I	stalled	a	bit,	while pretending	to	pay	no	attention	to	the	television.	“Yeah,”	I	said,	“I’m	pretty	tired.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	a	nice	long	yawn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ginny	said,	“And	the	next	number	is	8!”	as	if	eight	were	an	especially	exciting number. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	to	me.	35-8-27-9-18-9.	Those	were	the	magic	numbers.	They	were	burned in	my	brain	because	of	the	sequence	I	had	discovered	within	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know,”	I	said,	trying	to	keep	my	parents	distracted	from	the	TV,	“tonight’s episode	was	sort	of	disappointing.	Predictable	plot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t	it	predictable	every	week?”	Mom	said.	“Bad	guys	do	something	wrong, good	guys	catch	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	yes,”	I	said	as	Ginny	said	“27!”	I	tried	not	to	show	that	I	was	paying	any attention	to	what	Ginny	was	saying,	but	all	I	could	think	of	was	the	next	number: 9,	9,	9,	9!	I	continued,	“But	usually	you	can’t	figure	out	how	they’re	going	to catch	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	true,”	said	my	father.	“You	could	say	the	same	thing	about	every	mystery novel	ever	written.	Bad	guy	murders	someone,	detective	figures	out	who.”	My mother	loves	mystery	novels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	might	have	been	fascinating	conversation,	but	all	I	heard	was	Ginny	saying, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	the	next	number	is	9!”	I	was	just	two	numbers	away	from	winning! </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	this	point	I	was	too	distracted	to	be	able	to	participate	in	the	conversation	and I	just	hoped	the	discussion	I’d	started	would	be	carried	on	by	Mom	and	Dad without	me.	I	was	looking	at	them,	but	my	ears	heard	nothing	but	Ginny.	Ginny was	suddenly	my	favorite	person	in	the	whole	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>And	she	said	my	favorite	word	in	the	whole	world:	“Eighteen!”	she	squealed.	It was	all	I	could	do	not	to	squeal	along	with	her.	One	number	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh	my	gosh,	I	thought.	Suppose	I	actually	win.	A	hundred	million	dollars!	But	I wasn’t	thinking	about	what	I	could	do	with	the	money.	I	was	thinking	about	how I’d	ever	tell	my	parents	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still,	there	was	one	number	to	go.	One	chance	in	36	that	I’d	win. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	the	moment	my	mother	noticed	that	the	lottery	was	on	TV,	and	that’s	the moment	she	turned	it	off,	saying,	“What	are	we	doing	with	this	on!”	I	don’t know	if	she	noticed	that	I	was	paying	attention	to	Ginny,	or	whether	the conversation	about	how	predictable	mystery	novels	are	just	got	too	boring.	But just	as	the	ball	popped	out	of	the	lottery	basket	and	Ginny	inhaled	to	burble	the exciting	last	number	…	Click! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ok,	Jake,	time	for	bed,”	said	my	father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	been	up	late	enough	already,”	said	my	mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um,	ok,	I	guess	I’ll	be	going	to	bed,”	I	said,	as	if	I	weren’t	one	number	away from	a	hundred	million	dollars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	I	went	to	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	not	to	sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	5</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	morning	I	was	not	up	bright	and	early. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	because	I	was	up	dim	and	late	the	night	before.	I	tossed.	I	turned.	I practically	did	land-based	synchronized	swimming.	My	blankets	were	twisted around	me	as	tightly	as	if	elves	had	spent	the	evening	practicing	for	their knottying	merit	badge.	And	when	dawn	finally	came,	I	drifted	off	to	sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	sleep,	and	to	dream.	To	dream	about	coming	home	from	school	with	dollar bills	stuffed	into	every	pocket	and	down	my	shirt	and	in	my	cap	and	in	my	lunch box.	Dollar	bills	hanging	out	all	over	me.	And	my	mother	and	father	were waiting	for	me,	asking	me	how	my	school	day	had	been	and	if	I’d	like	a	snack, while	I	frantically	kept	shoving	bills	back	into	their	hiding	places,	hoping	my parents	wouldn’t	see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	nine	thirty	when	I	woke	up,	which	was	late	for	me	on	a	Saturday	morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	before	breakfast,	I	made	an	excuse	about	getting	some	exercise,	and hopped	on	my	bike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Pick-a-Chick	was	open.	Outside	was	a	stack	of	newspapers.	I	grabbed	one and	raced	inside,	pulling	a	dollar	from	my	pants	pocket.	Mrs.	Karchov	was feeling	particularly	chatty	that	day,	and	it	seemed	forever	before	she	gave	me	my fifty	cents	change. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thanking	her	-	remember,	I	am	a	nice	boy	-	I	went	outside,	sat	on	the	curb,	and with	trembling	fingers	looked	up	in	the	index	where	the	winning	lottery	number was.	Page	56.	It’s	amazing	how	hard	it	can	be	to	find	a	page	when	you	really want	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knew	I	had	five	of	the	six	numbers	right.	So,	when	I	got	to	page	56,	I	read backwards,	from	right	to	left.	There	it	was,	in	big	beautiful	black	ink:	9. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	won. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	prize,	the	paper	said,	was	$111,000,000. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	what	was	I	going	to	do? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>So	I	did	what	any	red-blooded	American	boy	would	do:	I	stood	up,	made	a	fist, pulled	my	elbow	in,	and	said,	“Yes!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	the	moment	Ms.	Floyd,	my	math	teacher,	decided	to	pass	by. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	so	excited?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	um,	my	favorite	team	just	won.”	This	was	desperate.	I	don’t	even	have	a favorite	team.	I	have	to	keep	reminding	myself	that	baseball	is	the	one	with bases. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	congratulations,”	she	said,	as	she	went	into	the	Pick-a-Chick.	I	hate seeing	teachers	outside	of	school.	It’s	so	confusing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	on	the	curb	again,	this	time	because	I	was	beginning	to	feel	dizzy	thinking about	what	had	just	happened	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	won	$111,000,000. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	began	to	think	of	all	the	things	I	could	buy.	And	after	each	thought	popped	in my	head,	there	was	a	picture	of	my	parents	grounding	me	for	111,000,000	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	super	CD	player.	Mom	shaking	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	speed	boat	for	our	vacations	on	Lake	Winpucket.	Dad	looking	disappointed	in me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brand	new	cars	for	my	parents.	Mom	and	Dad	giving	the	keys	back	to	the	car salesperson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Could	I	not	accept	the	prize?	Just	pretend	I	had	lost	the	ticket	or	the	woman	had never	given	it	to	me?	But	how	can	you	turn	down	$111,000,000?	I	could	give	it all	to	charity,	but	I’m	not	that	nice	a	boy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	guess	I	wasn’t	looking	so	happy	by	the	time	the	woman	who	looked	like	the Starship	Enterprise	came	back	out	of	the	store,	with	new	lottery	tickets	in	her hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	hello!”	she	said	cheerily. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>“Hello,”	I	said,	avoiding	her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	dear,	you	seem	upset?”	she	asked.	“Can	I	help	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	practically	laughed.	“Not	exactly,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	bothering	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,”	I	said,	“it’s	actually	sort	of	your	fault.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	fault,”	the	woman	said	in	great	surprise,	putting	her	hand	to	her	chest	as	if her	heart	were	failing	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only	sort	of.”	Now	I	had	to	explain.	“Remember,	you	gave	me	that	lottery ticket	a	couple	of	days	ago	because	I	helped	you	pick	up	some	buttons	that	had spilled?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	indeed.	You	were	very	kind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	being	polite.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	it’s	nice	to	meet	a	young	person	who’s	learned	his	manners.	The	ticket was	the	least	I	could	do	for	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Was	it	worth	$111,000,000	to	you	to	have	me	help?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“$111,000,000	…?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.	The	ticket	you	gave	me	won.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!	Really?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yup.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	sure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Totally.	Do	you	know	that	your	numbers	were	in	a	series?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course.	It	helps	me	pick	numbers	to	use	a	little	sequence	like	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Otherwise,	I	spend	forever	trying	to	decide	which	numbers	to	pick.	So	you won?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>“Well,	actually,	you	won,”	I	said.	“It	was	your	ticket.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,	now.	None	of	that.	I	gave	it	to	you	fair	and	square.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	it	doesn’t	seem	right	…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wanted	you	to	have	it.	But,	oh,	my,	what	are	you	going	to	do	with	all	that money?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	no	idea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	that’s	what’s	making	you	unhappy?”	she	asked	kindly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	really.	My	parents	are	dead	set	against	playing	the	lottery.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I	see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	fact,	my	father	has	an	editorial	against	it	on	the	front	page	of	this	paper.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	unfolded	a	newspaper	from	under	her	arm.	It	was	 <i class="calibre3">The</i>	 <i class="calibre3">Gaz</i>.	“You mean	this	article?	This	is	your	father?	He’s	a	very	good	writer.	The	editorial makes	a	lot	of	sense.”	She	was	holding	her	lottery	tickets	in	her	other	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	I	can’t	really	tell	them	that	I	won.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,”	she	said,	“Why	don’t	come	with	me	to	the	Soda	Squirt	and	we’ll	sit down	and	try	to	figure	this	out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	we	trudged	across	the	street	to	the	little	green	and	white	snack	bar.	“By	the way,”	she	said,	“I’m	Mrs.	Fordgythe.	Mrs.	Moira	Fordgythe.	What’s	your name?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jake,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	Jake,	let’s	take	a	booth	and	have	a	soda,”	she	said,	seating	herself	at	a	red leather	booth	that	barely	held	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	pay,”	I	said.	“Um,	actually,”	I	said,	checking	my	pockets,	“you’ll	have	to lend	me	some	money	…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pshaw,”	she	said,	“Don’t	you	worry	about	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>The	waitress	came	and	I	ordered	a	Coke,	although	I	actually	was	in	the	mood	for a	Coke	with	a	scoop	of	Cookies	and	Cream	ice	cream,	which	gets	most	of	your dessert	food	groups	into	a	single	glass.	Mrs.	Fordgythe	ordered	“a	simple	glass of	bubbly	bottled	water,”	-	she	patted	her	starship-like	stomach	-	“And,	oh,	a slice	of	that	dreamy	looking	cheese	cake.	And	instead	of	a	lime	in	my	bubbly water,	would	you	mind	adding	just	a	couple	of	squeezes	of	chocolate	syrup	and about	two	ounces	of	fresh	cream?	That	would	be	so	lovely,	thank	you,	dear.	Oh, and	a	scoop	of	pistachio	ice	cream	on	that	cheese	cake	would	be	divine.	Thank you	so	much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	sat	in	the	silence	of	two	people	who	don’t	know	each	other	sharing	a	booth	at an	ice	cream	shop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	must	be	very	hard	on	you,	poor	dear,”	she	said	at	last. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	parents	must	be	very	much	against	the	lottery.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	they	must	have	a	lot	of	respect	for	you	to	think	that	you’d	act	on	principle and	not	play	the	lottery.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	to	nod	again.	It	was	true,	but	I	hadn’t	thought	of	it	that	way	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,”	she	said,	“I	think	I	have	an	idea	about	how	to	get	you	your	money without	your	parents	knowing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	but	of	course	that	isn’t	your	problem.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	Your	real	problem	is	getting	your	parents	to	understand	how	you	came	by	a lottery	ticket	and	why	you	should	be	allowed	to	keep	your	winnings.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	true,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>“What’s	your	plan	for	getting	me	the	money?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	it’s	a	very	good	plan,	I	think.	Trust	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	say	anything.	To	trust	someone,	you	should	know	them	well	enough	to think	that	there	aren’t	any	odd	quirks	that	may	make	them	act	in	ways	you couldn’t	predict.	And	so	far	Mrs.	Fordgythe	was	all	quirks.	But	I	did	trust	her.	I couldn’t	tell	you	why. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	I	have	to	do?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	have	to	lend	me	your	ticket	for	a	few	days.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	why	can’t	you	just	come	explain	to	my	parents	that	you	gave	me	the	ticket because	I	helped	you	out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	no	no	no,”	she	said,	“I	don’t	think	that	would	be	wise	at	all.	You	parents will	think	that	you	shouldn’t	have	accepted	the	ticket,	and	I	would	so	much	like to	help	you	find	a	way	to	keep	the	money.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	then	our	food	arrived	and	seemed	to	wipe	all	thought	of	lottery	tickets, parents	and	111	million	dollars	out	of	Mrs.	Fordgythe’s	mind.	All	that	existed	for her	was	her	spoon,	her	mouth,	and	Mount	Dessert. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	she	was	done,	with	a	satisfied	smile	on	her	lips,	she	said,	“Ahh.	That	was refreshing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	I	handed	her	my	lottery	ticket,	slightly	bent	from	its	trip	in	my	pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	going	to	do	with	it?”	I	asked,	which	really	meant,	“Am	I	ever going	to	see	it	-	or	you	-	again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	Jake,”	she	said	as	she	took	it.	“I	really	think	this	plan	will	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	will	I	know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	back	to	the	Pick-a-Chick	on	Wednesday	around	3.	Is	that	all	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	suppose	you	have	to	reach	me	before	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	always	give	you	a	call.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>“But	you	don’t	know	my	number.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	be	silly.	‘Richter’	is	in	the	phone	book.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	waitress	came	back	and	left	the	bill	on	our	table.	I	stuck	my	hand	in	my pocket,	looking	for	money,	but	then	remembered	that	I	only	had	the	fifty	cents change	from	the	newspaper.	I	looked	at	Mrs.	Fordgythe,	embarrassed.	“Oh	don’t be	silly,	dear,”	she	said,	as	she	left	money	for	the	bill.	“You	don’t	have	your hundred	and	eleven	million	dollars	yet!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	stood	up	to	go.	I	felt	much	lighter	without	the	ticket	in	my	pocket.	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fordgythe	touched	me	on	the	arm	and	said,	“I’ll	see	you	on	Wednesday,	dear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	don’t	you	worry	about	a	thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	moment	I	didn’t.	And	then	I	had	a	sudden	thought.	“Wait,	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fordgythe,”	I	called	to	her	back	as	she	began	to	walk	away.	“I	have	a	question.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	dear,”	she	said	sweetly,	turning	towards	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	never	told	you	my	last	name.	How	did	you	know	it?”	I	could	almost	hear	the dramatic	background	music	as	the	detective	uncovers	the	clue	that	gives	it	all away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	pointed	to	her	copy	of	the	 <i class="calibre3">Gaz</i>.	“It	says	your	father’s	name	right	here,	dear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	yeah.	That’s	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	worry	about	a	thing,”	she	said	to	me	again	and	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	6</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Easy	come,	easy	go,”	is	what	I	told	myself	all	the	way	home.	It’s	not	like	I	ever really	had	the	money,	so	I	couldn’t	really	lose	it.	Still,	my	pockets	felt	mighty empty	walking	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But,	whatever	feelings	I	had	that	I	might	have	made	a	mistake	were	erased	as	I stepped	in	the	door.	“Shhh,”	my	mother	insisted,	“your	father’s	on	TV.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sure	enough,	there	was	Dad	being	interviewed	on	a	local	news	program.	“It doesn’t	matter,	Connie,”	he	was	saying	to	the	host	of	the	program,	“the	lottery	is nothing	but	gambling	-	backed	and	encouraged	by	your	tax	dollars.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	seated	next	to	him	started	to	talk,	but	Dad	went	right	on.	“You	know what	really	bothers	me?	The	fact	that	our	government	runs	advertisements encouraging	people	to	gamble.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	spoke	up.	“Still,	I’d	rather	have	the	government	run	the	lottery	and have	the	money	go	to	education	than	have	organized	crime	run	it	and	have	the money	go	to	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	Laureen,”	my	father	said,	“You	might	as	well	say	that	the	government ought	to	start	selling	cocaine	because	it’s	better	than	having	criminals	do	it.	And then	you’d	see	advertisements	telling	you	how	great	cocaine	is!	That’s	exactly the	situation	we’re	in	with	the	lottery.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	host	jumped	in	to	point	out	that	the	lottery	wasn’t	exactly	the	same	as	selling drugs,	but	my	father	was	just	gathering	steam.	Knowing	that	the	lottery	ticket was	out	of	my	hands	made	it	a	lot	easier	for	me	to	watch	the	rest	of	the	program. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	afternoon,	when	my	father	came	home	-	still	with	a	patch	of	makeup	from the	TV	appearance	on	his	forehead	-	we	all	told	him	what	a	great	job	he	had done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	producers	of	the	show	thought	I	did	pretty	well,	too,”	he	said,	obviously quite	pleased	about	something.	“In	fact,”	he	added,	pausing	to	keep	us	in suspense,	“they	want	me	to	create	a	special	debate	on	the	topic	‘Lottery:	Yes	or No.’	And	I’d	be	the	spokesperson	for	the	No	side.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>“That’s	wonderful,”	said	my	mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	a	‘nose	hide’?”	my	sister	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	a	nose	hide?”	I	asked,	completely	confused.	“Boogers?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	no”	my	mother	said,	“Maddie	wants	to	know	what	a	‘No	side’	is.	It’s someone	who	disagrees	with	something.	He’s	on	the	side	that	says	No.	That’s all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	liked	my	answer	better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	I	be	on	the	TV	show?”	asked	Maddie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	and	Mom	laughed.	“Maybe	when	you’re	older.	It’s	really	for	grownups.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	that’s	not	all,”	my	father	said.	“If	it	goes	well,	they	think	they’d	like	me	to host	a	whole	series!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	daddy	the	TT	star!”	said	Maddie.	We	all	laughed	because	“TT”	had	been my	old	nanny’s	cute	way	of	saying	“TV.”	Maddie	hadn’t	ever	met	her,	but	Aunt Flo	(as	we	called	her)	lived	on	in	family	legend,	along	with	one	of	my grandfather’s	old	hat	customers	who	used	to	recite	the	poem	“Hiawatha”	to	me whenever	I	saw	him.	And	there	was	my	father’s	childhood	dog	Whiskers	who once	ate	an	entire	plate	of	brownies	off	the	kitchen	table	and	then	knocked	over	a glass	of	milk	and	drank	it.	I	suppose	every	family	has	a	set	of	characters	that somehow	get	turned	into	legends	like	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	my	father	becoming	more	and	more	famous	for	his	anti-lottery	stand,	the fact	that	I’d	probably	never	see	that	lottery	ticket	again	should	have	been	a	relief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	lay	in	bed	unable	to	sleep	for	over	an	hour	that	night,	thinking	about	what	I could	have	done	with	a	hundred	and	eleven	million	dollars.	I	mainly	thought	of really	dumb	things	like	buying	a	yacht	and	completely	filling	it	with	those plastic	egg-like	containers	you	get	from	the	quarter	vending	machines.	Would $111,000,000	-	440	million	of	the	containers	-	be	enough?	It’s	really	hard	to figure.	Besides,	if	it	took	ten	seconds	to	put	a	quarter	in	and	turn	the	handle,	it would	take	1,222,222	hours	just	to	get	them	all.	That’s	over	50,000	days.	That’s over	139	years.	I	fell	asleep	as	I	was	figuring	in	Leap	Years.	Then	I	woke	up	in the	middle	of	the	night	and	thought	about	buying	a	collection	of	the	world’s	best electric	guitars,	with	every	musical	gadget	ever	invented.	I	tried	listing	them	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>put	myself	to	sleep,	and	had	gotten	up	to	treble	boosting	wah-wah’s	with	bass thumper	reverb,	when	I	finally	dropped	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	woke	up	feeling	like	I	had	lost	something.	Only	after	shaking	my	head	a	couple of	times	did	I	realize	that	I	was	feeling	the	loss	of	the	hundred	and	eleven	million dollars	I	never	actually	had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	Mondays,	I	usually	feel	rich	because	I	have	my	five	dollars	of	allowance	in my	pocket.	But	this	Monday	I	felt	poor	because	what’s	$5	compared	to	the	one hundred	and	eleven	million	dollars	I	didn’t	have? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	gym	teacher	let	us	out	ten	minutes	early,	and	I	hooked	up	with	Ari	outside, watching	some	of	the	older	kids	shoot	hoops.	We	could	have	tried	to	join,	but seeing	them	sigh	and	roll	their	eyes	made	it	not	worth	even	asking.	So	we	just sat	on	our	heels	and	talked.	Ari	told	me	about	a	really	annoying	visit	to	his	uncle during	which	his	father	and	uncle	almost	got	into	a	fistfight	over	a	stupid	ping pong	game.	When	he	was	done,	he	said,	“So,	what	did	you	do	this	weekend?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	almost	replied,	“Won	a	hundred	and	eleven	million	dollars.	And	then	gave	it	to this	lady	who	looks	like	a	starship.”	But	there	seemed	no	point.	More	important, I	discovered	that	a	part	of	me	was	still	thinking	that	Mrs.	Fordgythe	might actually	show	up	with	the	money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People	are	funny,	aren’t	we?	Or	maybe	not	funny	so	much	as	just	complicated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here	I	was	feeling	poor	because	I	was	convinced	I	never	was	going	to	see	the lottery	money	again,	but	another	part	of	me	was	saying,	“Now,	don’t	be	too hasty.	You	may	get	the	money	after	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	can’t	figure	me	out.	How	can	anyone	expect	me	to	figure	out	other	people? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Especially	Ari.	Monday	night	we	had	another	rehearsal	of	our	band.	When	I	got there,	you	didn’t	have	to	be	a	member	of	the	Psychic	Friends	Network	to	know that	something	was	bothering	Ari.	He	was	sitting	on	an	old	coffee	table	that	had been	in	his	garage	forever,	studying	his	shoelaces,	and	barely	lifted	his	head	to say	hello.	Mimi	was	reading	an	old	copy	of	 <i class="calibre3">People</i>	magazine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	Ari,”	I	said.	“What’s	bothering	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>This	is	all	part	of	the	ritual	we	all	seem	to	go	through.	Boys,	anyway.	When someone	asks	what’s	bothering	you,	you	always	have	to	deny	that	anything	is wrong	at	least	three	times	before	you	can	admit	it.	Ari,	being	Ari,	however, didn’t	quite	play	along.	I	only	had	to	ask	him	one	more	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wasn’t	prepared	for	what	he	had	to	say,	though.	I	expected	something	like:	“I just	realized	that	Wiley	Coyote	isn’t	ever	going	to	catch	the	Roadrunner,”	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	parents	won’t	let	me	paint	my	room	black,”	or	even	“I	think	my	athlete’s foot	has	spread	to	my	liver.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	not	ready	for:	“I’m	in	love.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	a	little	tiny	chuckle	escaped	me	-	I	really	should	get	credit	for	not	laughing out	loud	right	in	his	face	-	it	struck	me	that	I	wasn’t	being	fair.	What	was	wrong with	Ari	falling	in	love?	Sure,	he	acted	odd,	and	had	strange	ways	of	expressing himself,	but	he	had	feelings	like	anyone	else.	And,	more	to	the	point,	he	was allowed	to	make	as	big	a	jerk	out	of	himself	as	anyone	else.	I’m	not	saying	that everyone	who	falls	in	love	is	a	jerk.	Some	people	become	jerks	once	they	fall	in love.	That’s	been	my	experience	so	far,	anyway.	(“Wait	until	it	happens	to	you,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">is	what	my	twenty-year-old	cousin	Melinda	says,	and	she’s	not	a	jerk.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	love?”	I	said.	“I	thought	that	was	supposed	to	make	you	happy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me	too.	But	only	if	she	loves	you	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Amanda.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Amanda	Dunn?”	Mimi	and	I	both	asked	at	the	same	time.	This	wasn’t	funny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	bizarre.	And	maybe	even	dangerous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari	just	looked	at	his	sneakers	and	nodded	to	them	glumly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Amanda	Dunn,”	I	said	again.	Amanda	Dunn-it	as	she	was	known	because	if you	named	something	you’d	always	wanted	to	do,	Amanda	had	done	it.	Wind surfing,	backstage	pass	to	a	top	concert,	a	first	class	flight	to	Bermuda	to	go scuba	diving	with	a	private	tutor,	have	your	own	credit	card…Amanda’s	Done	It. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	parents	owned	the	Dunn	Regency,	Dunn	Manufacturing,	the	Dunn	Towers, Dunn	Estates	and	Dunn	Village	-	an	apartment	building,	an	office	building,	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>community	of	houses,	and	an	apartment	block	mainly	occupied	by	old	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	had	the	name	“Dunn”	written	on	them	in	the	same	ugly	cursive	script	taller than	Stretch	Levine,	our	star	basketball	player.	My	father	had	published	a	couple of	articles	about	Dunn	Village	because	some	people	claimed	that	Mr.	Dunn	was letting	the	place	get	run	down	so	that	the	old	people	there	would	leave	and	the Dunns	could	rent	the	apartments	to	people	with	more	money.	There	was	no	hard proof,	but	I	believed	it	anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amanda’s	life	seemed	to	revolve	around	the	fact	that	her	family	was	rich.	There were	the	big	things	like	the	fact	that	she	was	always	perfectly	dressed	and	looked down	on	anyone	she	thought	wasn’t	her	equal.	And	there	were	the	little	things like	the	fact	that	she	started	every	day	with	a	new	ballpoint	pen,	not	even	trying to	use	up	the	old	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari	and	Amanda?	Hard	to	imagine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	it	was	just	as	hard	to	imagine	what	Ari	saw	in	Amanda.	Ari	didn’t	care about	clothes.	That	was	obvious	from	how	he	dressed.	He	didn’t	care	about money,	so	long	as	he	had	enough	to	buy	a	triple	shake	at	the	Soda	Squirt.	Ari didn’t	even	care	about	girls	-	at	least	until	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	after	pretending	to	be	suddenly	fascinated	by	an	oil	can	on	the	window	of Ari’s	garage	so	that	I	could	keep	my	head	turned	away	from	him	as	I	put	on	a proper	expression,	I	said	calmly,	“Oh	really?	When	did	this	start?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari	sat	on	his	amplifier,	his	skinny	legs	swinging	in	his	very	wide	shorts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Forever,”	he	said	in	a	dreamy	sort	of	voice	as	if	he	was	talking	not	to	me	but	to the	clouds.	“Or	yesterday.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I	was	skateboarding	home.”	That	would	explain	the	scabs	on	his	knees, elbows	and	hands,	and	the	scratches	on	his	cheek,	arms	and	ankle	-	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rumple’s	sticker	bush	always	seemed	to	catch	him.	“And	there	she	was,	walking with	Lydia	Marmon.	We	were	on	Hillside	Hill,	so	we	were	going	about	the	same speed.	So	I	could	hear	her	talking.”	He	said	“her”	as	if	he	he	was	not	worthy	of saying	her	name.	His	eyes	were	wet	and	melty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	watching	this	longer	than	I	wanted	to,	I	prodded	him.	“And	what	was	she saying?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>“It	was	like	bells.	Little	silvery	bells.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	what	was	she	talking	about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About	the	dance.	Ah,	the	dance	…”	Ari	drifted	off,	probably	thinking	about whisking	her	around	the	dance	floor	in	a	swirl	of	glitter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	the	dance?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	can’t	go,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	not?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Her	father’s	grounded	her.	The	rogue!”	His	face	was	turning	red	with	anger.	I don’t	think	I’d	ever	heard	anyone	use	the	term	“rogue”	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	lost	her	father’s	Terwilliger	Spoon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“His	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Terwilliger	Spoon.	I’m	pretty	sure	that’s	what	she	said.	Her	voice	was	so silvery….” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	he	could	get	lost	in	the	memory	of	her	tinkling	voice,	I	sharpened	my tone	and	asked,	“Do	you	know	what	that	is?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	it	was	something	that	was	passed	down	in	his	family.	Mr.	Dunn	collects spoons.	She	said	something	like,	‘At	least	I	didn’t	borrow	one	of	the	spoons	with jewels	in	it,’	so	I	guess	some	have	diamonds	and	rubies	in	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	did	she	borrow	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	a	little	tea	party	she	was	giving.	Maybe	someday	she’ll	invite	me	to	one	…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	far	as	I	knew,	Ari	wouldn’t	know	which	end	of	a	teapot	to	pour	from.	Love does	strange	things	to	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly,	it	was	as	if	Ari	heard	how	dopey	he	sounded.	He	blushed.	“Let’s practice,”	he	insisted,	and	he	wouldn’t	let	us	stop	for	two	hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>Have	I	mentioned	that	love	does	strange	things	to	people? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	7</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Wednesday	came	as	slowly	as	a	slug	moving	across	an	open-faced	peanut	butter and	jelly	sandwich.	(You	don’t	want	to	know	how	I	know	about	that.) Wednesday	was	the	day	when	Mrs.	Fordgythe	was	supposed	to	tell	me	how	she was	going	to	get	me	my	lottery	winnings.	Or,	as	I	thought,	Wednesday	was	the day	when	I	would	know	for	sure	that	Mrs.	Fordgythe	had	done	what	any	normal person	would	have	done:	cashed	in	my	lottery	ticket	and	moved	to	Disneyland. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	coming	home	from	school	when	Mrs.	Fordgythe	suddenly	was	next	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	see	her	coming,	but	somehow	she	had	glided	into	place	and	was	saying my	name,	asking	me	to	walk	more	slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mrs.	Fordgythe!”	I	said	in	surprise,	almost	shock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	day,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	moment	I	almost	expected	her	to	start	to	gloat:	“I	have	a	hundred	and eleven	million	dollars	and	you	don’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	instead	she	said,	“I	have	splendid	news!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	found	a	way	to	give	you	your	money	without	anyone	knowing	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	hardly	anyone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	with	me,”	she	replied,	taking	me	by	the	elbow	and	steering	me	towards the	center	of	town. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ahead	of	us	was	the	First	Dominion	Trust.	Some	of	the	newer	banks	in	town looked	like	motels	or	drive-through	fast	food	joints.	But	not	the	old	First Dominion.	It	was	made	of	gray	concrete	and	marble,	with	front	doors	so	large that	you	could	fit	an	elephant	through	them,	which	would	be	useful	because	it probably	took	an	elephant	to	pull	the	doors	closed	every	night.	As	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fordgythe	and	I	mounted	the	steps,	I	could	feel	the	warm	smell	of	the	bank	-	like</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>the	scent	of	a	desk	drawer	you	haven’t	opened	in	a	couple	of	years	-	wrap	around me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	steps	echoed	behind	us	all	the	way	inside	until	we	reached	a	wooden	desk with	a	sign	that	said	“Julia	Minder.”	Ms.	Minder	looked	up	and	seemed	pleased. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mrs.	Fordgythe!	We’ve	been	looking	forward	to	your	visit.	I’ll	go	get	Ms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harrigan.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	all	my	years	of	coming	to	the	First	Dominion	-	usually	accompanying	my mother	on	an	errand	-	I	had	never	made	it	to	a	desk,	only	to	the	counter	where tellers	stand	behind	bars	and	count	out	cash.	Now	Ms.	Minder	was	taking	us beyond	the	desks,	all	the	way	to	a	private	office.	She	knocked	on	the	door	and swung	it	open.	As	soon	as	she	saw	us,	Ms.	Harrigan	was	on	her	feet	and	coming towards	us,	with	her	right	hand	in	front	of	her,	ready	for	a	shake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	in,	come	in,”	said	Ms.	Harrigan.	“Mrs.	Fordgythe,	Mrs.	Fordgythe!	This must	be	Jacob	Richter.”	She	shook	both	our	hands.	She	was	older	than	my mother	but	younger	than	Mrs.	Fordgythe,	and	was	dressed	in	a	gray	skirt	with	a gray	jacket	and	some	type	of	white	scarf	that	entirely	covered	her	neck	and almost	reached	past	her	chin.	“Have	a	seat,	have	a	seat.”	Apparently	she	was	the type	of	person	who	likes	to	say	things	twice	just	to	convince	you	she	meant	it	the first	time.	She	had	us	sit	in	the	red	leather	chairs	in	front	of	her	desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	were	apparently	very	popular	at	this	bank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	well,”	said	Ms.	Harrigan.	“So	this	is	our	new	depositor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually,”	said	Mrs.	Fordgythe,	“he’s	not	a	new	depositor	at	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	not	at	all,	not	at	all,”	said	Ms.	Harrigan,	“But	he’s	about	to	become	our largest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	mean?”	I	asked.	I	didn’t	want	to	admit	that	I	knew	what	was	going on	until	I	knew	it	for	a	fact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ms.	Harrigan	smiled	and	said	“Mrs.	Fordgythe	is	about	to	make	a	little	gift	to you,	a	little	gift.”	She	nodded	to	Mrs.	Fordgythe	who	rummaged	in	her enormous	pocket	book	for	what	seemed	like	three	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	my,	where	is	it?	I	know	I	had	it	this	morning,”	she	said	as	we	listened	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>rustlings	and	clankings	of	her	bag	as	she	fished	around.	I	practically	expected her	to	dive	headfirst	into	it	and	emerge	wearing	scuba	gear.	“Oh,	yes,	here	it	is,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	said	at	last,	holding	a	light	blue	rectangular	piece	of	paper	in	her	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	gave	it	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	it.	It	was	a	check.	It	was	made	out	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	amount	was	$110,999,997.46. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	hand	began	to	shake	so	I	rested	it	on	the	desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	me?”	I	finally	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Fordgythe	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	must	have	been	in	shock	because	the	first	thing	I	thought	of	wasn’t	what	I could	do	with	so	much	money.	It	was	instead	why	it	wasn’t	an	even $111,000,000.	It’s	not	that	I	cared	about	the	missing	couple	of	dollars.	I	was	just curious.	But	I	didn’t	want	to	look	like	the	stingiest	person	in	history	by	asking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead,	I	dug	deep	inside	my	soul	to	find	the	exact	words	to	express	my feelings.	I	think	I	came	up	with	something	pretty	poetic.	“Holy	cow!”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Holy	cow,	holy	cow,”	repeated	Ms.	Harrigan.	She	seemed	like	a	nice	woman, but	I	was	suddenly	glad	she	wasn’t	my	mother.	It	would	have	driven	me	nuts, driven	me	nuts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	continued,	“Mrs.	Fordgythe	used	your	lottery	ticket	to	pick	up	the	money from	the	Lottery	Commission,	and	then	came	here	to	make	sure	that	we	could put	it	into	your	account	without	having	to	tell	anyone	else.	Which,	of	course,	we can	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Holy	cow,”	I	said	again,	brilliantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	it	was	quite	a	little	adventure	going	to	the	Lottery	Commission,”	said	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fordgythe.	“They	were	very	nice	about	it.	They	didn’t	seem	very	excited,	but	I suppose	giving	out	millions	of	dollars	becomes	just	part	of	a	day’s	work	after	a while.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>“Aren’t	you	going	to	be	in	the	newspapers	because	you	won?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	They	passed	a	law	a	few	months	ago.	Winners	were	getting	so	pestered	by people	asking	for	money	that	the	lottery	officials	aren’t	allowed	to	give	out	the name	of	the	winner,	unless	the	winner	wants.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Even	if	the	winner	is	a	kid?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I	don’t	know	about	that.	But	officially,	a	kid	didn’t	win	it.	An	old	lady did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aw,	you’re	not	so	old,	Mrs.	Fordgythe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	very	polite	of	you,	Jake,	but	I	know	exactly	how	old	I	am,	and	I’m	an	old lady.	In	any	case,	let’s	get	this	check	deposited	to	your	account.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ms.	Harrigan	leaned	over	and	pointed	to	the	back	of	the	check.	“Just	sign	your name	here,	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	the	pen	Ms.	Harrigan	offered.	I	was	so	nervous	that	I	made	the	“J”	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jake”	especially	large	and	wondered	if	that	would	mean	the	check	wouldn’t count.	But	Ms.	Harrigan	didn’t	seem	to	care.	She	took	the	check	back	from	me, held	it	up	admiringly,	and	said,	“Very	good,	very	good.	Congratulations,	Jake, we’ll	put	this	in	your	account	as	of	this	afternoon,	this	very	afternoon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great,”	I	said.	“But	there’s	something	else	I	have	to	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’d	like	to	withdraw	some	money?	No	problem,	no	problem.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	much?”	asked	Ms.	Harrigan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eleven	million	dollars,	please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	took	the	wind	out	of	Ms.	Harrigan’s	sails.	“Eleven,	um,	eleven,	um,	eleven, um…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	promised	to	split	the	winnings	with	my	sister.	Ten	percent.	She	has	an	account here,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>“Then	it	shouldn’t	be	any	problem	at	all,	at	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very	good	of	you	to	keep	your	promise,	Jake,”	said	Mrs.	Fordgythe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	know	what	to	say	because	it	hadn’t	occurred	to	me	that	I	might	not	keep my	promise:	the	curse	of	being	a	nice	boy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,”	said	Ms.	Harrigan,	“Would	you	like	to	withdraw	a	little	pocket	money	for you	to	have	to	spend?	Might	be	useful,	be	useful.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	sure,	I	guess.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	much?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know.	How	about	ten	dollars?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Fordgythe	responded,	“Well,	Jake,	you	don’t	want	to	have	to	keep	coming back	to	the	bank.	It	might	make	people	suspicious.	I	think	you	ought	to	withdraw a	little	more	than	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fifteen?”	Mrs.	Fordgythe	shook	her	head.	“Twenty?	Fifty?	A	hundred dollars??!”	Mrs.	Fordgythe	finally	nodded.	“A	hundred	dollars	seems	like	an awful	lot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ms.	Harrigan	smiled.	“Jake,	we’re	going	to	invest	your	money	so	that	you’re going	to	be	earning	ten	percent	on	your	100	million	dollars.	That	means	that	if you	don’t	spend	any	of	it,	in	a	year,	the	100	million	dollars	in	your	bank	account will	earn	ten	million	dollars.	Just	by	not	spending	it.	And	later	we	need	to	talk about	ways	to	invest	the	money	so	you	can	make	more	than	that.	I	really	think we’d	need	to	have	your	parents	involved	in	any	discussion	of	investments.”	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fordgythe	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	my	parents	don’t	have	to	know	about	this,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Absolutely	not.	I’ve	checked	with	our	tax	lawyers,	and	this	prize	is	tax	free.	Of course,	you’ll	have	to	fill	out	some	tax	forms	at	the	end	of	the	year,	but	we	can help	you	with	those.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ten	million	dollars	a	year!”	The	fact	that	I’d	get	this	for	not	doing	anything except	letting	the	money	sit	in	the	bank	made	it	feel	like	I	had	won	not	a	hundred</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>and	eleven	million	dollars	but	a	magic	purse	that	always	filled	itself	up	again	no matter	how	much	you	spent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ok,”	I	said,	“I’ll	withdraw	a	hundred	dollars.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ms.	Harrigan	filled	out	a	slip	and	stood	up,	indicating	that	our	meeting	was	just about	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	more	question,	though,”	I	said.	“Mrs.	Fordgythe,	why	did	you	deposit $110,999,997.46	instead	of	a	hundred	and	eleven	million?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	my	dear	boy,”	she	said,	“Remember,	you	said	that	the	ice	cream	float	was on	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	8</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	woke	up	the	next	day,	I	felt	tired	and	restless,	as	if	there	were	something I	was	supposed	to	be	doing	but	I	couldn’t	remember	what.	At	first	I	thought	it must	have	been	a	dream,	but	as	I	pulled	on	my	clothing,	it	struck	me:	I	had	a hundred	million	dollars	in	the	bank,	and	what	I	was	supposed	to	do	today	was	be rich. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	problem	was	that	I	had	no	idea	how	to	be	rich.	I	couldn’t	snap	my	fingers and	have	Jeeves	the	Butler	enter.	I	couldn’t	go	to	the	Rolls	Royce	store,	pick	out a	model	and	say,	“What	the	heck,	give	me	two.”	I	couldn’t	even	buy	a	new basketball	without	making	my	parents	suspicious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	did	figure	out	two	things	to	do,	although	they’ll	probably	seem	awfully	small	to you	-	sort	of	pathetic,	really.	First,	during	lunch	I	bought	an	extra	brownie.	And then,	after	school,	I	went	to	the	Small	Lives	pet	store	and	got	two	fish	I	had	been admiring	for	a	long	time	but	never	even	considered	buying	because	they	were way	out	of	my	price	range.	But	my	parents	wouldn’t	know	that.	They	had	no idea	how	much	fish	cost,	unless	you’re	buying	them	by	the	pound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	only	fear	was	that	they	(my	parents,	not	the	fish)	would	ask	me	what	I	paid for	them	(the	fish,	not	my	parents).	I	promised	myself	that	I	would	never	lie about	the	money.	I	didn’t	want	the	money	I’d	won	to	turn	me	into	a	liar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	emptied	the	baggie	into	the	fish	tank	and	watched	my	rare	and	exotic	new	fish examine	their	new	home.	They	didn’t	seem	to	care	at	all.	You’ve	got	to	hand	it	to fish:	It	takes	a	lot	to	get	them	upset. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	lay	on	my	bed	looking	at	the	fish	tank,	I	thought	about	how	weird	my	day	at school	had	been	-	my	first	day	as	a	multi-millionaire.	The	day	would	go	along normally	and	then	I’d	remember	I	was	rich,	and	I’d	get	a	little	jolt.	I’d	drift	off into	a	daydream	for	a	bit,	and	then	something	would	bring	me	back	to	school.	I’d pay	attention	to	school	for	a	while,	and	then	…	another	jolt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	left	my	hundred	dollars	at	home	and	went	to	school	with	three	dollars	in	my backpack.	They	felt	different	now.	Before,	they	were	the	three	dollars	that	I	had and	everything	I	could	buy	was	stacked	up	against	them.	Now,	they	were	just	a tiny	part	of	an	endless	stream.	It’s	like	the	difference	between	carrying	a	canteen</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>and	having	running	water.	With	a	canteen	you	have	to	constantly	worry	about whether	taking	a	drink	now	is	going	to	mean	you’re	going	to	go	thirsty	later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	running	water,	you	just	know	it’s	always	there.	It’s	a	good	feeling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	the	most	interesting	thing	that	happened	to	me	that	day	didn’t	seem	that interesting	at	the	time.	It	was	Ari	mooning	about	Amanda	again.	We	were walking	from	English	to	Phys	Ed	(or	“Fizz	Ed”	as	I	used	to	think	it	was	called), the	longest	walk	in	the	school.	And	since	we	were	in	the	middle	of	a	unit	on aerobic	exercises,	neither	of	us	was	exactly	racing	to	get	there.	I	used	to	think running	in	place	was	the	stupidest	human	activity,	but	then	our	class	started doing	“step	aerobics”	where	you	walk	up	and	down	a	stairway	that	has	a	single step	on	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari	was	going	on	and	on	about	how	Amanda’s	hair	smelled	like	roasted chestnuts	and	her	smile	was	like	square	pearls	with	her	braces	being	the	necklace and	her	walk	was	like	a	gazelle	except	she	only	had	two	legs	and	didn’t	graze	on wild	clover	or	chew	her	cud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	latest	bout	of	Amanda	fever	was	brought	on	by	the	fact	that	he	had	actually spoken	with	her.	It	took	most	of	the	walk	to	the	gym	to	find	out	what	had happened,	but	it	seems	that	Ari	had	fallen	off	his	skateboard	just	before	entering the	school	building	and,	as	luck	would	have	it,	was	propelled	straight	into	the school	door	precisely	as	Amanda	was	starting	to	enter.	Ari	rebounded	off	the door,	and	Amanda	assumed	that	he	was	lunging	to	hold	the	door	for	her.	She glanced	at	him	and	Ari,	in	his	panic	at	being	noticed,	actually	blurted	out, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Terwilliger	…”	It	was	the	only	word	he	could	think	of. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amanda	smiled	the	smile	of	a	Greek	goddess	(remember,	I	heard	this	from	Ari) and	said,	“Terwilliger?	What	about	Terwilliger?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Spoon,”	Ari	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes	it	is.	What	do	you	know	about	it	…	um	…”	she	said,	pausing	for	him	to	tell her	his	name	even	though	they	had	been	in	the	same	home	room	for	four	years and	so	she	had	heard	his	name	called	at	roll	approximately	720	times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	few	moments	in	which	Ari	considered	what	it	would	take	to	get	his	name changed	to	“Rock”	or	“Lance,”	he	said,	“Ari.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	Ari,	how	do	you	know	about	the	Terwilliger	Spoon?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>“I	heard	you	lost	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“From	whom	could	you	have	heard	such	a	thing?”	she	asked,	not	so	sweetly	this time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“From	you.	I	was	behind	you	when	you	were	talking	about	it	with	Lydia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	were	eavesdropping?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	Well,	yes,	but	not	on	purpose.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amanda	turned	away	and	started	walking	down	the	hall.	Desperate	to	extend	the conversation,	Ari	blurted	out,	“I	can	help	you	find	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	how	is	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	I	know	where	it	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’s	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um,	the	last	place	you	saw	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At	the	Madagascar	Café?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	that’s	right,	the	Mada	…	Mada	…	Magadagga	Daggadagga.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	why	don’t	you	get	it	for	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	you	can	go	to	the	dance,”	Ari	said	hopefully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	her	eyes	turned	to	weapons	and	she	pierced	him	with	her	gaze.	“I	can	go	to any	dance	I	want,”	she	said	icily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	thought	your	father	grounded	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	what	 <i class="calibre3">he</i>	thinks,”	she	said.	She	lowered	the	flames	in	her	eyes	and	said, suddenly	sweetly,	“But	if	you	can	get	me	the	Terwilliger	Spoon,	I’d	appreciate it.”	She	smiled	like	a	boa	constrictor	digesting	a	particularly	juicy	rabbit	and walked	slowly	to	her	first	class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	the	time	I	saw	Ari	during	the	walk	to	Fizz	Ed,	he	was	swinging	back	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>forth	between	delight	in	thinking	that	Amanda	had	paid	attention	to	him	and	fear that	he	had	made	a	promise	on	which	he	could	not	come	close	to	delivering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	am	I	going	to	do?”	he	said	during	one	of	the	fearful	moments.	“I	have	no idea	where	the	Terwilliger	Spoon	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,”	I	said,	“she’s	given	you	a	starting	place.	The	Madagascar	Café.	Why don’t	we	go	over	there	this	afternoon	and	see	if	they’ve	found	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ok.	But	I	wish	she’d	eaten	somewhere	easier	to	pronounce.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	afternoon,	after	I’d	gone	to	the	fish	store	and	made	my	purchase	-	two Danio	kyathi	from	Burma	-	Ari	came	over	and	we	rode	our	bikes	to	the Madagascar.	You	could	tell	this	was	one	of	the	fanciest	restaurants	in	town because	it	only	had	a	tiny	sign.	Also,	there	were	real	flowers	in	glass	vases	on top	of	white	tablecloths	on	every	table.	This	was	definitely	the	type	of	place Amanda	would	hang	out	in.	Of	course,	it	didn’t	hurt	that	under	the	sign	it	said that	it	was	“A	Member	of	the	Dunn	Family	of	Companies”	-	yet	another	spot	in town	owned	by	Amanda’s	dad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	stood	outside,	uncertain	of	how	to	approach	the	matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	could	just	ask,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ask	if	they	found	a	fancy	spoon?	They’ll	know	it’s	not	ours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So?	We’ll	tell	them	it’s	Amanda’s	and	they’ll	call	her	father.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	I	won’t	get	the	credit.	Besides,	don’t	you	think	they	would	have	noticed	if they	found	a	spoon?	It	must	have	gotten	mixed	up	with	their	regular	spoons which	are	probably	pretty	fancy	themselves.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	could	ask	to	see	their	spoons,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	sure,”	Ari	said	sarcastically.	“‘We’re	teenage	spoon	inspectors.	Show	us your	silverware	or	be	prepared	to	suffer	the	consequences.’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ok,	ok,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	stood	silently,	our	bicycles	leaning	against	us.	“Got	it!”	I	said.	“You	could</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>get	a	job	there	washing	dishes!	Then	you	could	inspect	all	the	spoons.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari	brightened.	“Yeah!”	he	said	enthusiastically.	“Oh,	no.	Drat!	How	can	I	get	a job	there?	My	parents	won’t	even	let	me	join	the	computer	club	because	I’m already	doing	too	many	things	after	school.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	pondered	again.	And	thus	it	was	that	I	ended	up	as	the	Madagascar’s	new dishwashing	assistant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	not	the	way	I	had	expected	to	spend	my	afternoons	after	I	put $100,000,000	into	my	bank	account. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	didn’t	take	me	long	to	be	sure	I	had	seen	all	of	the	restaurant’s	silverware.	And all	of	it	was	the	same.	As	far	as	I	was	concerned,	there	were	only	two	types	of silverware	at	Madagascar’s:	ones	covered	with	goopy	food,	and	ones	clean	but so	hot	that	you	could	barely	touch	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	would	have	quit,	but	I	would	have	felt	like	I	had	lied	to	the	manager	of	the Madagascar,	a	big	man	with	a	thin	little	mustache	that	fascinated	me.	Also,	he turned	out	to	be	a	pretty	nice	fellow.	So	I	decided	to	stick	it	out	there	for	a	week. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	was	done,	I	reported	to	Ari	that	there	was	no	Terwilliger	Spoon	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari	wiped	most	of	the	milk	off	of	his	upper	lip	and	said,	“Well,	that’s	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	necessarily,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	a	plan.	But	I	couldn’t	tell	Ari	because	it	would	reveal	to	him	that	I	was	a rich	kid.	So,	when	he	insisted	on	knowing,	all	I	said	was,	“I	can’t	tell	you	yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I’m	going	to	need	your	help.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anything,”	he	said,	hope	beginning	to	beat	in	his	heart	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	need	to	find	out	exactly	what	the	Terwilliger	Spoon	looked	like.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	trust	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	ok,”	he	said.	“But	how	are	we	going	to	find	out	what	it	looked	like?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>“Where	else?	The	Internet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Usually	we’re	good	at	finding	what	we	need	-	Ari	especially	has	a	knack	for	it	-</p>
<p class="calibre1">but	we	came	up	empty	this	time.	So,	that	afternoon	we	went	to	the	library,	and we	looked	through	just	about	every	book	and	magazine	in	the	place.	We	even engaged	the	help	of	Mr.	Lipton	the	Librarian.	He	was	a	weight	lifter	and	the rumor	was	that	he	had	come	in	third	in	the	Mr.	Universe	contest.	When	Mimi once	asked	him	about	it,	he	replied	by	giving	her	a	Dewey	Decimal	number	that turned	out	to	lead	to	a	shelf	of	books	about	rumors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Lipton	pointed	Ari	and	me	to	reference	works	we	had	never	even	heard	of. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	weighed	so	much	that	it	took	two	of	us	to	open	it,	although	Mr.	Lipton carried	it	in	one	hand.	All	that	we	found	was	an	entry	in	 <i class="calibre3">The	Century	Book	of</i> <i class="calibre3">Achievements</i>	that	was	actually	a	guide	to	rich	people.	We	discovered	that Graham	Terwilliger	had	made	a	fortune	in	India	importing	guns	which	he	traded for	Indian	art	masterpieces,	and	that	he	later	settled	in	this	country	where	he made	a	second	fortune	trading	Indian	masterpieces	for	logging	rights	in	the Northwest.	The	only	connection	to	a	spoon	was	a	reference	to	his	elaborate parties.	Perhaps	he	used	the	spoon	to	serve	caviar	…	which	he	probably	served in	crumpled	up	Indian	art	masterpieces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	left	the	library	no	wiser	-	at	least,	not	any	wiser	about	the	Terwilliger	Spoon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari,	predictably,	was	glum.	I	said,	“Let’s	go	to	the	Soda	Squirt.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	out	of	money,”	said	Ari.	“I	spent	everything	on	a	new	pair	of	shoes	for	the dance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	ok,	I	think	I	have	some,”	I	said.	“You	know,	from	washing	dishes	at	The Madagascar.”	I’d	earned	$54	from	my	work.	When	I’d	gone	to	deposit	it,	Ms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Minden	took	me	aside,	punched	some	numbers	into	a	calculator,	and	told	me	that in	the	nine	hours	I’d	worked	at	The	Madagascar,	I’d	earned	$4,109.59	in	interest, just	by	doing	nothing.	That’s	$684.93	every	hour	of	nothingness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	we	were	slurping	the	last	of	the	chocolate	glop	at	the	bottom	of	our Atomic	Sundaes,	I	had	an	idea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	it?”	Ari	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	tell	you.	And	the	best	part	is,	you	get	to	speak	to	Amanda	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>So,	the	next	day,	Ari	showed	up	at	school	forty-five	minutes	before	it	started	so that	he	could	casually	run	into	Amanda	by	coincidental	unplanned	accident.	I	sat with	him	behind	a	large	tree	at	the	end	of	the	schoolyard	where	we	had	a strategic	view	of	everyone	who	entered.	I	had	a	nasty	cramp	by	the	time	Amanda strolled	up	the	stairs,	and	wasn’t	really	paying	attention.	And	Ari	was	busy trying	to	carve	his	and	Amanda’s	initials	into	the	bark	of	the	tree	with	a	number 2	pencil.	When	I	spotted	her,	it	was	almost	too	late.	Ari	shot	up	like	a	rabbit who’s	just	seen	a	fox,	and	practically	knocked	Amanda	down.	Again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because	we	had	gone	over	what	he	was	going	to	say	so	many	times,	I	could	tell what	he	was	saying	even	though	I	could	only	barely	hear	him:	“Hey,	Amanda,	I had	an	idea.	If	your	father	has	a	picture	of	the	Terwilliger	Spoon,	I’d	be	happy	to make	some	inquiries.”	This	would	have	come	off	as	more	casual	if	he	hadn’t	had to	look	twice	at	a	scrap	of	paper	he	was	carrying	to	remind	himself	of	what	he was	supposed	to	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	followed	an	exchange	I	couldn’t	make	out,	but	apparently	it	went	well enough	because	Ari	came	back	and	reported	that	she	was	going	to	think	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	day,	Ari	found	an	envelope	in	his	locker	with	a	picture	of	the Terwilliger	Spoon	inside	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	at	last	I	had	found	a	reason	to	be	rich. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rode	to	the	edge	of	town	where	there	was	a	shop	I	had	often	passed	and wondered	about:	Smithy’s	Silver	Smith.	The	store’s	neighbors	were	a	bingo parlor	and	an	abandoned	tire	store	with	a	pile	of	old	tires	in	the	parking	lot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There,	between	them,	was	Smithy’s,	with	a	carefully	cleaned	blue	and	silver	sign picturing	a	gleaming	crown.	In	the	window	were	shiny	rings,	broaches	and necklaces,	carefully	arranged	on	black	velvet.	It	seemed	an	odd	place	to	have	a silver	shop, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello?”	the	owner	asked,	not	looking	up	from	the	stool	on	which	he	sat.	He	was hunched	over	a	work	table	that	had	strands	of	wire,	pliers,	a	lit	flame,	small hammers,	and	polishing	cloths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	a	child,”	he	said,	still	not	looking	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>“Yeah,	I	guess.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	guesses!”	he	said,	snorting	a	laugh.	He	looked	up.	“Ah,	an	in-betweener,”	he said,	not	unkindly.	He	was	holding	a	battered	piece	of	silver	with	a	dark	pair	of pliers	in	one	hand,	and	a	sharp-pointed	hammer	in	the	other.	He	put	them	both down,	dropped	off	the	stool	-	his	feet	didn’t	reach	the	ground	while	sitting	-</p>
<p class="calibre1">brushed	some	silvery	slivers	from	his	thick	brown	apron,	and	looked	me	straight in	the	eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	can	I	help	you,	my	young	man,”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	make	silver	things?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	gestured	to	his	work	bench.	“That	is	precisely	what	I	do.	Guillermo	Smith, silversmith,”	he	said,	shaking	my	hand.	He	looked	me	in	the	eye	again,	as	if trying	to	see	something	buried	way	back	in	my	brain,	as	I	waited	for	sensation	to return	to	my	crumpled	right	hand.	His	own	eyes	were	dark	and	capped	by	bushy eyebrows	that	needed	a	good	mowing.	The	rest	of	his	head	was	hairless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	staring	into	my	face,	he	seemed	to	make	up	his	mind	about	me.	“How	can	I help?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	you	make	a	spoon	for	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	spoon?”	he	asked	thoughtfully.	“Yes,	well,	of	course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Except	it’s	got	to	look	just	like	this,”	I	said,	pulling	out	the	picture	of	the	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dunn’s	spoon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Terwilliger,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I	know	it.	My	father	made	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really.	He	was	commissioned	to	make	twenty	of	them.	I	watched	him	make them	as	a	boy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>“That’s	amazing,”	I	said.	“But	I	thought	it	was	commissioned	by	a	guy	who lived	in	the	19th	Century.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	laughed.	“That	was	the	story	the	man	who	created	them	wanted	people	to believe.	He	was	really	just	a	local	businessman	with	an	eye	for	a	sharp	deal.	He thought	it	would	make	the	spoons	more	valuable	if	they	had	a	glamorous	history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	worked,	too.	He	made	a	fortune	selling	them	to	collectors.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	they’re	not	really	worth	that	much?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	don’t	get	me	wrong.	My	father	did	a	magnificent	job	on	them.	They	just have	nothing	to	do	with	Indians	and	elephants.	But	the	Terwilligers	are	special	to me.	They’re	what	got	me	interested	in	silver	smithing.	I	watched	my	father	craft each	one	to	perfection.	I	loved	everything	about	them	-	the	brightness	of	the silver,	the	tapping	and	tinking	of	the	hammer,	the	shine	that	came	out	of	hiding	if you	rubbed	it	enough.	My	father	was	a	far	better	silversmith	than	I.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	think	you	could	make	another?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps.	I	don’t	know.	I’d	like	to	try.	But	why	would	you	want	a	Terwilliger Spoon?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	remembered	my	vow	not	to	let	my	fortune	turn	me	into	a	liar.	“I	can’t	really	tell you,”	I	said.	He	nodded,	turned	his	back	to	me,	and	bent	over	his	workbench. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	promise	you,	it’s	not	for	anything	wrong.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	you	tell	me	what	you	would	do	with	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	going	to	replace	one	that	a	friend	lost.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm.	I’m	not	sure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	like	I’m	going	to	sell	it	to	make	money.	I	just	want	to	help	out	a	friend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	have	any	idea	how	much	it	would	cost	to	make	a	spoon	like	the Terwilliger?”	I	shook	my	head.	“It’s	a	big	spoon.	Lots	of	silver.	Highest	quality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	itself	will	run	hundreds	of	dollars.	And	then	you’ll	only	have	a	shapeless lump	of	metal.”	He	looked	to	see	if	I	was	shocked.	“Then,	I’ll	have	to	spend many,	many	hours	working	the	metal.	Look	at	the	detail	in	this	photograph.	All told,	I’d	say	it’s	going	to	cost	around	$2,000.	So,	much	as	I’d	like	to	help	you</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a>…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	out	an	envelope	from	my	backpack	and	started	counting	out	hundred dollar	bills;	I	had	stopped	at	the	bank	on	my	way	over.	When	I	got	to	20,	I stopped	counting.	“That’s	two	thousand,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	must	say	I	enjoyed	Mr.	Smith’s	look	of	astonishment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	on	earth	did	you	…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	it	was	my	turn	to	look	Mr.	Smith	in	the	eye.	I	made	a	decision.	“I	can	trust you	can’t	I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	he	said.	I	liked	that	he	didn’t	say	anything	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	won	a	lot	of	money	in	the	state	lottery.	But	no	one	knows	because	I	can’t	tell my	parents	about	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	won	enough	to	afford	spending	$3,000	on	an	ugly	ceremonial	spoon?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	you	said	it	was	$2,000.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	was	before	I	knew	you	could	afford	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Smith	looked	lovingly	at	the	photograph.	“A	Terwilliger.	It’s	something	I’ve always	wanted	to	try.	Come	back	in	a	week.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	9</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari,	Mimi	and	I	went	to	the	movies	the	next	night.	The	line	was	long	and	when we	finally	got	to	the	ticket	booth,	Ari	started	fishing	through	his	pockets,	trying to	find	enough	coins	to	pay.	He	pulled	out	old	LifeSavers,	a	bubble	gum wrapper,	a	rusty	AA	battery,	a	button	declaring	him	a	Special	Saver	at	the	local drug	store,	and	more	shredded	tissues	than	anyone	should	have	to	look	at.	I	was tempted	to	whip	open	my	wallet,	slap	a	fifty	dollar	bill	down,	and	pay	for	all three	of	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	couldn’t.	I	had	to	pretend	to	be	a	kid	with	only	a	kid’s	amount	of	money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	we	went	to	the	snack	counter.	Mimi	ordered	a	large	popcorn	and	a	small soda.	It	was	$6.50.	She	only	had	$6,	so	she	had	to	have	the	guy	take	back	the popcorn	and	get	a	medium.	Meanwhile,	I’m	standing	there	with	enough	money in	my	pocket	to	buy	snacks	for	the	entire	line.	I	wanted	to	be	able	to	say	to	her, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get	whatever	you	want.	It’s	on	me.”	But	I	couldn’t.	She	turned	down	my	offer of	fifty	cents	but	if	she	knew	I	had	$100,000,000	I	think	she	would	have	been OK	with	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	day	the	three	of	us	were	in	a	bookstore	because	Mimi	had	to	buy	a copy	of	 <i class="calibre3">David	Copperfield</i>,	part	of	the	Read	Books	You	Don’t	Like	program	in school.	We	were	browsing,	and	she	was	thumbing	through	a	book	about	the history	of	comics	and	their	relationship	to	the	historical	events	of	the	time.	It looked	great	but	it	cost	$35	so	Mimi	wasn’t	even	thinking	about	buying	it.	But could	I	say,	“Let’s	get	it	and	then	look	around	for	more	books	that	seem interesting”?	Nope.	I	couldn’t	even	buy	her	the	hardcover	version	of	 <i class="calibre3">David</i> <i class="calibre3">Copperfield</i>	even	though	Mimi	always	says	how	much	she	prefers	hard	covers	to paperbacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	been	able	to	buy	myself	two	tropical	fish.	That’s	what	my	$100,000,000</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	been	good	for	so	far. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	driving	me	nuts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	our	next	band	rehearsal,	we	were	still	totally	terrible.	But	occasionally	we would	accidentally	hit	the	right	note	at	the	same	time	and	it	would	sound	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	is	something	special	about	playing	music	together	that	I	don’t	think	you</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>can	understand	until	you’ve	done	it.	A	sound	comes	out	that	needed	three	people to	be	heard,	if	only	for	one	second. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	happened	maybe	twice.	The	rest	of	the	time	we	played	our	instruments, made	jokes,	tried	out	different	ways	of	arranging	the	songs,	drank	soda,	and were	silly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	while	Ari	was	coming	out	of	a	big	drum	solo	that	sounded	like someone	had	rolled	a	drum	set	down	a	stairway,	Mimi	started	playing	her	bass guitar.	After	four	measures,	I	was	supposed	to	come	in	with	my	guitar.	But	just as	Mimi	was	hitting	the	lowest	note	her	guitar	makes,	the	sound	from	her	lousy amplifier	went	from	really	bad	to	not	even	being	music.	You	know	those noisemakers	you	blow	through	and	they	make	a	razzing	noise?	That’s	what Mimi’s	amplifier	now	sounded	like.	She	tried	playing	high	notes	and	the	razzing sounded	more	duck-like.	Since	we	knew	of	no	bands	that	have	been	successful by	playing	the	electric	duck,	we	stopped	and	considered	the	possibilities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	doesn’t	sound	good,”	I	noted	cleverly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	sounds	way	broken,”	Ari	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	it’s	just	a	loose	wire	or	something,”	Mimi	said	hopefully,	unplugging	it from	the	wall.	“Do	you	have	a	screw	driver?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Give	it	a	minute,”	I	said.	“Sometimes	electrical	stuff	stores	electricity.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	just	going	to	take	off	the	front,”	she	said.	Ari	handed	her	a	screwdriver.	The front	cover	came	off	easily.	“Well,	that’s	not	good,”	Mimi	said,	pointing	to	a large	rip	in	the	paper	speaker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	could	tape	it,”	Ari	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	so,”	I	said.	But	we	tried	anyway.	Now	the	amplifier	sounded	like	a duck	with	a	cork	in	its	bill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	we	going	to	do?”	Mimi	asked?	“That	was	my	brother’s	amp.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	he	going	to	be	angry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	he	hasn’t	played	in	years.	He	pretty	much	gave	it	to	me.	But	I	can’t	afford</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>to	replace	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	magic	words:	“Can’t	afford.”	They	were	magic	because	they	stopped	people from	doing	things.	But	I	had	bigger	magic.	Much	bigger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	may	have	money	saved	up…”	I	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimi	looked	at	me	sharply.	“I	thought	you	said	you	had	about	$50	a	couple	of weeks	ago.	Besides,	I	wouldn’t	let	you	buy	me	a	new	amp.	They	cost	hundreds of	dollars.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,”	said	Ari,	“I	guess	that’s	the	end	of	The	Scutters.”	He	put	his	drumsticks down.	“Too	bad.	We	were	getting	really	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No,	we	weren’t,	but	why	argue? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I	was	going	to	have	to	return	my	drum	set	soon	anyway,”	Ari	said.	His parents	had	rented	it	for	him	to	try	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,”	said	Mimi,	“Let’s	see.	We	have	one	drummer	playing	the	air	drums,	one bass	player	playing	the	ripped-speaker	amp,	and	one	lead	guitarist	with	a	toy amplifier.”	I	was	using	an	amp	designed	for	little	kids	who	wanted	to	pretend that	they’re	on	the	radio.	“Quite	the	Top	40	group.”	She	packed	her	bass	into	its cardboard	carrying	case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	quitting?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	quitting,	but	I	can’t	play	if	my	amplifier	sounds	like	the	back	end	of	a cow	with	indigestion.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ewwww,”	said	Ari.	“Once	I	was	visiting	a	farm	with	my	parents	and…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ok,	Ari,	we	don’t	have	to	hear	about	that,”	said	Mimi,	who	really	had	no	one	to blame	but	herself	for	bringing	it	up	in	the	first	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimi	headed	toward	the	door.	“I	guess	I’ll	go	home	and	get	ahead	on	my homework	or	something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	you	wait	a	minute?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>“Sure.	You	want	to	ride	with	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	I	mean,	I’m	not	sure.	Can	you	just	give	me	a	minute	to	think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	goll-lee!”	Mimi	said,	surprised	at	the	sharpness	in	my	tone.	Usually	when people	say,	“Can	you	give	me	a	minute	to	think?”	what	they	actually	mean	is, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Back	off!	You’re	rushing	me.”	But	I	actually	wanted	a	minute	to	think. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	hard	to	think	when	your	friends	are	watching	you.	How	do	you	sit	in	a thinkful	position?	How	do	you	stroke	your	beard	if	you	don’t	have	one?	I	felt them	looking	at	me,	wondering	what	I	was	thinking	about.	Of	course,	mainly	I was	thinking	about	how	hard	it	is	to	think	when	people	are	watching	you	try	to think. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	I	gave	up	thinking	and	instead	decided. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	get	you	a	new	amplifier,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With	what?	Fifty	dollars?	That’s	very	nice	of	you,	Jake,	but	…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I’ll	get	you	whatever	amplifier	you	want.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ok,	I’d	like	a	Fender	810	Pro	cabinet	with,	oh,	let’s	see,	a	Fender	Bassman	300</p>
<p class="calibre1">All	Tube	head.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ok.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’ll	run	you,	let’s	see,	that’s	$1,000	and	$1,100,	a	total	of	about	$2,100.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ok.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ok?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	not	entirely	ok.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aha,”	Mimi	said.	“I	didn’t	think	so!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	the	money	is	ok.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	money	is	ok?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>“The	money	is	ok.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	what	isn’t	ok?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can’t	get	anything	too	obvious.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	Fender	810	Pro	with	a	Bassman	300	All	Tube	head	is	pretty	obvious.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	the	problem,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari	interrupted.	“Could	you	two	please	talk	in	longer	sentences?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,”	said	Mimi,	“and	maybe	you	could	explain	what	the	heck	you’re	talking about.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sit	down,	Mimi,”	I	said,	patting	the	couch	next	to	me.	“Really,	you	want	to	be sitting	for	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	look	happy	about	being	told	what	to	do.	But	she	sat	down	anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sitting.	Go	ahead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	won	the	lottery.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	that’s	great!”	said	Ari. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Congratulations,”	Mimi	said.	“Do	your	parents	know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope.	I	haven’t	told	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	lying	to	them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	just	haven’t	told	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Interesting.	So,	how	much	did	you	win?”	Mimi	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	lot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	lot	a	lot?”	asked	Ari. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“More	than	a	lot	a	lot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>“How	much	more?”	Mimi	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“$100,000,000.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimi	laughed	once.	Ari	seemed	to	lose	interest.	He	was	assuming	that	I	was teasing.	“No,	really,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“$100,000,000.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh	huh.	How	much,	Jake?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	right.	It	wasn’t	$100,000,000.	It	was	$111,000,000,	but	I	gave $11,000,000	to	Maddie	because	I	promised	her	10%	if	she’d	keep	it	quiet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimi	laughed	harder.	Ari	looked	angry.	“Why	don’t	you	just	tell	us?”	he demanded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	true.	I	was	the	big	winner.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	bought	a	ticket	even	though	your	father	is	the	biggest	anti-lottery	guy	in the	state?”	Mimi	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	never	buy	tickets,”	Ari	pointed	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	exactly.”	And	then	I	told	them	how	by	being	a	nice	boy	I’d	been	given	a ticket	by	a	lady	who	looked	like	a	spaceship	and	how	I	was	hiding	it	from	my parents	and	how	I’d	bought	two	tropical	fish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	great,”	Mimi	said,	“but	I	don’t	actually	believe	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me	neither.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me	neither,”	I	said.	“I	wake	up	every	day	and	I	check	to	see	whether	it’s	still true.	And	it	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Prove	it,”	Ari	said.	He	didn’t	like	being	teased. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Buy	something.	Something	big	and	expensive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>“I	can’t.	I	have	to	pay	in	cash	because	I	don’t	have	a	credit	card.	And	I	can’t	buy anything	that	my	parents	can	find	out	about	because	then	they’ll	know.	And	you guys	can’t	tell	anyone!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	worry,”	said	Mimi.	“We	don’t	believe	you	enough	to	tell	anyone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	when	you	do	believe	me…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	we	both	promise	never	to	say	a	word.	Don’t	we,	Ari?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	sure,	I	guess.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can’t	guess.	You	have	to	promise,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right.	I	promise	not	to	tell	anyone	your	fake	secret.	It’s	not	very	nice,	you know,	Jake.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry	but	it’s	true.	Tomorrow	let’s	go	shopping	for	bass	amps.	And	I’ll	get	me	a new	guitar.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari	looked	hurt.	“How	about	something	for	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	going	to	be	tough.	I	can	buy	an	amp	for	Mimi	and	a	guitar	for	me because	we’ll	keep	them	here	in	your	basement	and	your	parents	won’t	notice	or think	anything	of	it.	But	if	you	were	to	come	home	with	a	brand	new,	fancy drum	set,	how	would	you	explain	it	to	your	parents?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	found	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	have	to	try	to	think	of	something	to	buy	you	that	your	parents	won’t notice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh.	Good!	…	Not	that	I	believe	you,”	Ari	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	of	course	not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	day	after	school,	the	three	of	us	went	to	the	outskirts	of	town	where there	was	a	store	that	sold	musical	instruments.	It	was	one	of	those	stores	that looked	like	it	was	owned	by	someone	who	really	loved	what	they	sold.	New	and used	instruments	were	stacked	everywhere:	brass	over	here,	woodwinds	over</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a>there,	keyboards	in	the	back.	A	guy	was	playing	some	pretty	great	guitar	in	the big	area	lined	with	guitars	of	all	sorts.	He	finished	the	line	of	music	he	was playing,	put	the	guitar	down,	and	said	“Just	looking	or	can	I	help	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	the	moment.	Mimi	and	Ari	had	come	along	with	me,	playing	it	safe	by pretending	I	was	fooling	them.	But	they	also	knew	me	well	enough	to	know	that I	wouldn’t	lead	a	salesperson	along	only	to	reveal	at	the	end	that	we	were	really just	wasting	his	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	should	have	been	easy.	After	all,	we	 <i class="calibre3">were</i>	there	to	buy.	I’d	taken	$5,000	out	of the	bank	account.	Fifty	hundred	dollar	bills	were	in	an	envelope	in	my	backpack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	all	I	had	to	say	was,	“We’d	like	to	buy	an	amp	and	a	guitar.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	hesitated.	I	looked	around.	I	cleared	my	throat.	I	said	“um”	a	couple	of times	just	to	make	it	clear	that	I	was	still	paying	attention.	I	checked	to	see	if	my shoes	needed	tying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Make	yourself	at	home,”	the	man	said.	“Try	out	anything	you	want.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	we	did.	I	took	down	an	expensive	electric	guitar.	“Let	me	plug	that	in	for you,”	the	man	said.	“I	know	some	stores	tell	kids	not	to	touch.	But	it’s	my	store and	playing	music	means	touching	an	instrument	just	right.	That’s	what	I	always say.	Here	you	go.”	Not	only	did	he	plug	the	guitar	into	an	amplifier,	he	turned	it up	loud.	Very	loud.	So	loud	that	even	my	lousy	playing	sounded	good.	Every note	I	played	caused	every	other	instrument	in	the	place	to	vibrate	at	the	same frequency.	From	alto	saxes	and	bass	drums	to	xylophones	and	zithers,	they	all were	playing	along	with	me.	I	wasn’t	playing	the	guitar.	I	was	playing	a	music store. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	the	best	I’d	ever	played. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	the	vibrating	and	echoing	had	ended,	the	store	owner	said,	“Cool,	isn’t	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I	could	only	nod	in	reply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	about	a	bass	amplifier,”	Mimi	prodded	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ok,”	I	said.	“Excuse	me,	but	do	you	have	any	bass	amplifiers?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure	we	do.	New	and	used.	Come	over	here.	And	take	down	one	of	those	bass guitars	so	you	can	try	them	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a>Mimi	selected	a	cheap	one.	“I	don’t	want	to	scratch	it	and	have	to	buy	it,”	she explained	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	picked	out	a	big	old	bass	amp	and	plugged	Mimi	in.	And	he	turned	it up	loud.	Everything	shook.	If	Mimi	had	found	the	right	notes,	she	probably could	have	hopped	the	entire	store	over	a	couple	of	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	an	old	one,”	the	man	said,	“but	I	like	it	better	than	most	of	the	new	ones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Very	rich,	bass-y	bass.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimi	nodded,	overwhelmed.	“It’s	bass-y	all	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Try	out	some	of	the	others	if	you	want,”	the	man	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	love	this	one.	It’s	old	and	it’s	beat	up,	but	the	sound	is	amazing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,”	I	said.	“Ari’s	parents	are	less	likely	to	notice	a	used	one	than	if	we	came in	with	a	new	one.	So,	should	we	get	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	sure,”	Mimi	said,	not	sure	if	she	was	serious	or	just	playing	along	with	a joke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ok.	And	I’d	like	to	get	myself	a	guitar.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,”	Mimi	said.	“How	about	this	one?	It’s	only	…”	she	looked	at	the	price tag,	“$1,500.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	I	like	that	one.	But	this	one	feels	better,”	I	said,	handing	her	a	beautiful new	guitar	with	a	bright	orange	sunburst	finish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	it’s	only	$1,250.	What	a	bargain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	so,	too.	I’m	going	to	get	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great.	And	I’ll	buy	you	a	flat	pick	for	it.	Just	to	keep	up	my	end.	What	do	they cost	these	days?	Twenty-five	cents?	Heck,	I’ll	get	you	two.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	I	get	these	drumsticks?”	Ari	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get	a	dozen	of	‘em,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>“Ok,	big	shot,”	said	Mimi.	“Go	up	to	the	nice	man	and	buy	the	guitar,	the	bass amp,	and	the	half	dozen	drumsticks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	the	flat	pick,”	Ari	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	I	gathered	my	courage	and	went	up	to	the	man.	“Excuse	me,	but	we’d	like	to buy	some	stuff.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,”	he	said.	“What’ll	it	be?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	this	is	going	to	seem	strange,	but	I	was	given	a	lot	of	money	for	a	big event…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like	a	birthday?”	he	suggested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sort	of.	So,	I	have	a	whole	bunch	of	cash,	and	I’d	like	to	buy…”	and	then	I	just blurted	it	out:	“This	bass	amp,	this	guitar	and	a	dozen	drumsticks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	a	flat	pick,”	said	Ari. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have	you	seen	the	price	tags?”	the	man	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	The	guitar	is	$1,250	and	the	bass	amp	is	$650.	And	the	drumsticks	are	$5</p>
<p class="calibre1">each.”	I	reached	into	my	backpack	and	took	out	twenty	bills.	“And	this	is	our money.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whoa!”	the	man	said,	surprised	I	actually	had	the	cash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	my	gosh!”	Mimi	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	drummed	his	fingers	on	the	counter.	“Usually	when	a	kid	is	given	a bunch	of	money	for	his	birthday	or	his	bar	mitzvah	or	whatever	it	was,	and	he wants	to	spend	it	on	instruments,	his	parents	come	in	with	him,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sure,”	I	said.	“But	this	is	different.	My	parents	would	be	fine	with	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	believe	you,	but	I	have	to	check	with	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look	at	it	from	my	point	of	view.	I	trust	you.	I	like	you.	I	watched	how	you</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>treated	each	other.	You’re	good	friends	and	that	means	you’re	good	kids.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,	I	can’t	take	$2,000	from	a	kid	who’s,	what,	13	or	14	years	old.	Suppose	it’s money	his	parents	gave	him	for	college.	He	brings	his	equipment	home	and	I	get an	angry	call	from	his	parents.	How	dare	I	take	that	money	from	a	kid?	Didn’t	I know	better?	I’ve	got	to	give	the	money	back,	and	I’m	lucky	if	the	parents	don’t call	the	police	on	me.	You	understand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	guess.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,	I	feel	terrible.	I’d	love	for	you	to	have	the	instruments.	I’d	love	to	make the	money	selling	them	to	you.	But	I	can’t.	Not	like	this.	Bring	your	parents	in and	we’ll	do	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	sure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sure.	I’m	sorry	but	I’m	sure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	must	have	looked	as	sad	as	I	felt.	I	liked	that	guitar	a	lot,	and	I	wanted	Mimi	to have	her	bass	amp.	The	man	saw	how	I	was	feeling	and	said,	“I	won’t	sell	the amp	or	the	guitar	to	anyone	until	you	come	back.	Any	time	in	the	next	week. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ok?	Then	you	can	bring	your	mom	or	dad	in…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wasn’t	going	to	be	bringing	my	parents	in.	“Thanks,	but	don’t	bother.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ok.	Whatever	you	say.	Sorry,	kids.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Us,	too.	But	thanks	for	letting	us	play.	You	have	a	very	cool	store.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks.	Come	back	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	were	getting	on	our	bikes,	Mimi	said	to	me,	“That	was	hard.	We	believe you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,”	said	Ari.	“You	won	the	lottery.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	only	wish	we	could	celebrate,”	I	said.	And	then	we	rode	home	to	Ari’s	garage, my	cheap	guitar,	and	Mimi’s	broken	amp. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p63"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	10</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Keep	it	down,”	my	father	yelled	at	me	from	another	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	shocked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	father	was	being	really,	really	crabby.	Normally,	my	father	is,	if	anything,	a goofball,	the	type	of	dad	who	balances	a	round	cushion	on	his	head	while dancing	around	the	room	singing	“It’s	Only	a	Paper	Moon,”	for	no	reason	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	gets	angry,	it’s	usually	because	of	something	particular.	Then	he confronts	you	with	it	in	person,	you	get	punished	if	that’s	required,	and	it’s	over and	he’s	back	to	being	his	normal	goofball	self.	Oh,	sometimes	he	gets	a	little overly-serious	about	some	issue,	but	that’s	Dad	being	a	newspaper	editor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	I	was	surprised	when	he	yelled	at	me	for	singing	along	to	an	MP3	in	my room.	Sure,	I	may	have	hit	some	remarkable	high	notes	that	went	through	our house’s	walls	like	a	hot	skewer	going	through	a	marshmallow.	But	normally	my father	would	have	joined	in	instead	of	yelling	at	me.	Worse,	he	was	staying	mad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	went	into	the	study	where	he	was	working	on	something	on	his computer,	he	didn’t	look	up	and	didn’t	say	hello.	He	was	being	crabby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	morning	at	breakfast,	he	was	a	big	bowl	full	of	crabs	again.	He	stood by	the	counter	reading	the	paper	-	not	 <i class="calibre3">The	Gaz</i>,	but	the	big	city	paper	we	had delivered	-	and	only	talked	to	us	to	get	us	to	eat	more	neatly,	which	is	usually	my mother’s	job.	It	was	as	if	he	were	looking	for	ways	to	crab	us	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	afternoon,	he	drove	me	to	the	dentist.	In	silence.	As	we	pulled	into	the parking	lot,	I	asked	him	“What’s	wrong?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	still	didn’t	look	at	me.	“Nothing’s	wrong,”	he	said,	but	he	must	have	sounded unconvincing	even	to	himself.	“I’m	having	a	little	trouble	with	the	paper.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	kind	of	trouble?	Can	I	help?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	he	answered,	almost	smiling.	“It’s	nothing	to	worry	about.	It’s	just	that advertising	is	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>“Competition.  <i class="calibre3">The	Boynton	County	Register</i>	is	eating	into	 <i class="calibre3">The	Gaz</i>	a	little	bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	just	part	of	business.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>?	Why	would	anyone	advertise	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	cover	a	lot	more	territory.	Of	course,	they	don’t	cover	it	as	well,	but advertisers	like	having	their	message	delivered	all	over	the	tri-county	area.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	going	to	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	not	much	to	do.	We’ll	do	fine,”	he	said,	trying	to	look	unconcerned.	But I	had	a	full	day	of	his	crabbiness	behind	me	to	tell	me	that	he	was	worried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	the	dentist,	I	met	up	with	Ari.	He	was	putting	decals	on	his	skateboard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aren’t	they	cool?”	he	asked.	I	agreed,	although	I	thought	what	would	really make	him	look	cool	on	a	skateboard	was	not	falling	off	of	it	every	time	he	got	on it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	were	you	kidding	about	the	lottery?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	is	so	cool.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	I	guess.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	we,	like,	go	buy	something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	Ari,”	I	said,	getting	a	little	crabby	myself.	“I	told	you,	no	one	can	know about	this.”	A	sudden	suspicion	came	over	me.	“Did	you	tell	anyone?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!”	he	insisted	convincingly.	“Hey,	Mimi,”	he	said,	waving	to	her	as	she zoomed	up	on	her	bike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	rich	boy,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mimi!	Don’t	tease	me.	That	has	to	stay	really	secret.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ok,”	she	said.	“I	won’t	ever	call	you	that	again.”	And	she	didn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,”	I	said,	“I	have	to	show	you	something.”	I	took	the	new	Terwilliger	Spoon</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a>out	of	its	velvet	sack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow,”	Ari	and	Mimi	said	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari	broke	the	silence.	“How	much…?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	looking	at	three	thousand	dollars	worth	of	spoon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	a	lot	of	spoon,”	Mimi	said.	She	cocked	her	head	to	the	side	to	get	a	new look	at	it.	“It’s	kind	of	ugly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	right.	Too	many	curlicues	for	my	taste. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	how	are	we	going	to	give	it	to	Amanda?”	Ari	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	sure,”	I	said.	“Maybe	after	school	you	could	go	up	to	her…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	up	to	her?”	he	said	with	fear	written	across	his	face	in	big	red	letters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	said	Mimi	with	certainty,	“I	think	we	ought	to	go	for	drama	here.”	Ari	put down	the	rag	he	was	using	to	wipe	the	dirt	off	his	skateboard.	“She’ll	like	that better.	Don’t	just	 <i class="calibre3">give</i>	it	to	her.	Make	it	reappear	mysteriously,	and	let	her	know that	you’re	the	one	that	made	it	happen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Interesting,”	I	said.	“What’s	your	plan?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,”	said	Ari	to	Amanda,	one	foot	nervously	rolling	his	skateboard	backwards and	forwards.	In	my	head	I	was	yelling,	“Get	your	foot	off	the	skateboard!”	I knew	what	would	happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	what?”	replied	Amanda,	not	particularly	warmly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	I	was	just	wondering	if	your	father	has	a	special	place	for	the	Terwilliger Spoon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amanda	looked	at	him	as	if	he	were	from	another	planet.	I	couldn’t	blame	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although	Ari	was	following	our	script,	he	was	so	awkward	and	phony	about	it that	he	did	seem	a	bit	like	an	alien	trying	to	pass	for	human.	“Why	do	you	care?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	asked	in	return. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>“Just	idly	wondering.	No	real	reason.	Just	wondering.	Wondering,	wondering</p>
<p class="calibre1">…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lydia,	standing	next	to	Amanda,	said	to	her,	“Come	on,	let’s	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	keeps	it	on	the	mantel	in	the	drawing	room,	if	you	really	want	to	know” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amanda	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mantel,	mantel.	Very	mantle.	Yes,	drawing	roomly	mantel.	Very	mantely.”	Ari’s circuits	obviously	were	melting	down.	Fortunately,	Lydia	stepped	in	and	pulled Amanda	away	as	she	stared	at	my	gibbering	friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	was	inevitable,	the	skateboard	slipped	from	under	Ari’s	foot,	bounced	off	the wall,	and	skittered	to	a	stop	at	the	bottom	of	the	hill.	Fortunately,	it	hadn’t actually	run	anyone	over.	This	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	job,”	I	said	to	Ari	after	the	two	girls	had	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mantle-y,”	he	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus	concluded	Phase	One	of	Mimi’s	plan,	also	known	as	The	Easy	Phase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Phase	Two	promised	to	bring	much	more	adventure.	Somehow,	we	had	to	sneak the	spoon	back	into	the	Dunn	Mansion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimi	had	worked	out	the	details.	That’s	why	I	was	now	drinking	more	water than	I	could	possible	hold,	waiting	for	Amanda	to	enter	the	cafeteria.	At	last, water	burbling	out	of	my	mouth	back	into	the	water	bubbler	as	quickly	as	it	was burbling	in,	Amanda	and	Lydia	approached.	I	casually	followed	them	into	the cafeteria	and	sat	down	next	to	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mind	if	I	sit	here,”	I	said,	already	sitting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well…”	began	Lydia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	a	free	country,”	finished	Amanda.	Charming	girls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	put	my	book	bag	next	to	Amanda’s.	And	waited. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a>We	were	half	way	through	the	green	Jell-O	with	mystery	fruit	before	Mimi sauntered	up.	Lydia	had	left	for	her	next	class.	“Amanda,	can	I	talk	with	you	for a	minute?”	Mimi	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amanda	looked	surprised.	Then	annoyed.	“I’m	eating,”	she	replied,	gently nibbling	around	the	Jell-O	edges	of	what	once	might	have	been	a	grape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	important.	It’d	be	a	personal	favor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	could	almost	hear	Amanda’s	inner	voice	thinking,	“Aha!	She’ll	owe	me	a favor	in	return	…	something	I	can	use	against	her	whenever	I	want!”	“Well,	ok,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	said	out	loud.	“Go	ahead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	here.	It’s	personal.	Could	you	just	step	over	to	this	empty	table?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	they	were	chatting,	I	managed	to	“accidentally”	knock	both	my	bag	and Amanda’s	onto	the	floor.	While	scrabbling	under	the	table	to	retrieve	both	bags, I	replaced	Amanda’s	social	studies	book	with	my	own.	We	were	done	with	social studies	for	the	day	and	I	hoped	she	wouldn’t	notice	the	switch	before	she	got home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	just	bringing	the	bags	back	up	to	the	table	when	Amanda	came	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	doing?”	she	demanded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our	bags	fell	off.	Just	picking	them	up.	Sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amanda	looked	darts	at	me,	took	one	more	spoon	of	green	Jell-O,	and	left	for English	class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	she	was	safely	gone,	Mimi	came	over.	“You	do	it?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yup.	What	did	you	two	gals	talk	about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	nothing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	had	to	be	something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	girl	talk.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Girl	talk?	I	didn’t	know	there	still	was	something	called	girl	talk.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>“If	you	must	know,	I	asked	her	advice.	I	figured	it	would	appeal	to	her	vanity.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Advice	on	what.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Something.	What	was	it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,”	Mimi	said,	flushing,	“If	you	really	have	to	know,	I	asked	her	if	she	was interested	in	you.	You	know,	if	that’s	why	she	was	sitting	next	to	you.	I	acted jealous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Absolutely.	And	she	fell	for	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	didn’t	suspect	a	thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	picked	up	my	book	bag	-	the	one	with	Amanda’s	book	in	it	-	and	started	to	go to	my	next	class.	But	I	turned	and	asked	Mimi	one	more	question:	“What	did	she say	about	being	interested	in	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	answer	apparently	involved	Mimi	dumping	the	last	of	the	green	Jell-o	into my	hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">On	a	normal	Saturday,	I’d	be	in	my	worst	jeans,	which	are,	of	course,	the	ones	I like	best	-	ripped	knees,	a	patch	where	the	back	pocket	used	to	be,	cuffs	torn	up and	greasy	from	getting	caught	in	my	bike	chain.	Not	this	Saturday,	though.	No, I	was	dressed	better	than	I	dress	for	school.	I	even	combed	my	hair	with	water	so that	it	would	stay	in	place	for	more	than	12	minutes.	Today	was	special.	Today,	I was	going	to	the	Palace	of	the	Dunns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	12:30,	Ari	pulled	up	to	our	house.	He	was	not	only	dressed	neatly,	he	actually had	buttoned	his	top	button,	making	him	look	like	he	had	escaped	from	a	1950s sitcom.	He	was	fidgeting,	scratching	at	his	arms	then	his	ribs,	then	his	arms again.	Meanwhile,	he	had	a	dumb	grin	stuck	on	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a>“Let’s	go,”	I	said,	and	we	rode	off	to	the	Dunns’	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	could	see	the	house	towering	over	Chestnut	Hill	as	you	rode	up.	First	you saw	the	twin	towers,	covered	with	ivy.	Then	you	saw	the	main	part	of	the	house, three	stories,	old	brick,	stained	glass	windows.	Then	at	last	you	saw	the	tall	iron gate	with	the	steel	muskrats	atop	every	post.	We	announced	ourselves	at	the	gate to	a	man	twice	my	father’s	age	and	with	twice	my	father’s	hair.	“You	are expected,”	he	said	after	looking	at	a	list	on	a	clipboard.	The	gate	swung	open and	we	bicycled	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	walked	up	the	steps,	the	door	opened	as	if	by	magic.	The	front	hall	was the	size	of	a	small	circus	tent,	with	wood	and	stained	glass	everywhere.	A stairway	wide	enough	for	three	horses	swept	through	the	center.	The	hall	was colder	than	outside	and	smelled	like	my	grandmother’s	linen	closet.	Behind	the door	was	a	tall	man	who	introduced	himself	as	Mr.	Paul	and	offered	us lemonade.	I	said	yes	at	the	same	time	as	Ari	said	no.	Ari	switched	to	yes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Mr.	Paul’s	footsteps	echoed	behind	him,	we	heard	the	soft	shuffle	of	slippers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Who	was	approaching	but	Mr.	Dunn	himself,	dressed	in	a	dark	blue	business suit,	white	shirt,	yellow	tie	with	blue	stripes,	and	worn-out	leather	slippers.	He had	a	copy	of	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>	folded	under	one	arm	with	a	copy	of	 <i class="calibre3">The	Gaz</i> sticking	out	from	inside	of	it.	“Who	have	we	here?”	he	asked	in	a	courteous voice.	“Friends	of	Amanda’s?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,”	I	said.	I	don’t	usually	call	people	“sir,”	but	I	had	a	sense	that	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dunn	would	like	it.	“I’m	Jake	and	this	is	Ari.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Dunn	shook	our	hands.	“Mr.	Paul	has	let	you	in	and	is	fetching	Amanda?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lemonade,”	Ari	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	yes,	lemonade.	And	Amanda.	And	do	you	have	last	names?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Richter,”	I	said.	If	I’d	made	up	a	name	to	protect	my	identity,	I	was	sure	that Ari	would	have	corrected	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jake	Richter,”	Mr.	Dunn	said	thoughtfully.	He	straightened	the	papers	under	his arm	so	that	 <i class="calibre3">The	Gaz</i>	no	longer	stuck	out.	I	couldn’t	tell	whether	that	was	because he	recognized	me	as	the	son	of	the	editor	of	his	competitor	or	because	he	saw	me staring	at	the	papers.	“And	you,	my	boy?”	he	asked	Ari. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p70"></a>“Ari,”	he	said	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	your	last	name?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari	said	nothing	for	a	suspiciously	long	time.	“Marshall,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Marshall,	you	might	want	to	study	a	bit	harder,”	Mr.	Dunn	said	in	what	was apparently	supposed	to	be	a	joke.	“Next	time,	we’ll	have	a	pop	quiz.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pop,”	Ari	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	it	became	clear	why	Ari	had	been	left	speechless:	Amanda	had	entered from	the	library,	a	blaze	of	red	and	orange	in	a	house	of	brown	and	black.	“Ah, there	she	is.	Enjoy	this	glorious	afternoon,”	Mr.	Dunn	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amanda	was	carrying	my	social	studies	book,	the	one	I’d	switched	with	hers	in the	cafeteria	on	Friday.	Ari	looked	at	her	like	a	bird	that’s	just	been	shot	out	of	a tree.	But	before	he	hit	ground	he	saw	another	person	enter	from	the	library: Roger.	The	football	player.	Roger.	The	boyfriend.	You	could	practically	see	Ari shrink	inside	his	clothes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Roger	was	looking	us	up	and	down,	no	doubt	figuring	how	many	yards	he could	throw	us,	Mr.	Paul	came	back	with	four	glasses	and	a	pitcher	on	a	silver tray.	“Shall	I	serve	the	lemonade	on	the	veranda,	Amanda?”	Although	I	was tempted	to	reply,	“How	about	in	the	hall,	Mr.	Paul?”	I	was	a	good	boy	and	held myself	back.	Amanda	was	surprised	that	we	were	staying	longer	than	it	took	just to	drop	off	the	book,	but	she	had	been	brought	up	to	be	polite	enough	not	to object	as	we	walked	to	a	porch	full	of	tropical	flowers	and	the	tinkle	of	falling water.	Not	exactly	my	taste,	but	not	half	bad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	an	amazing	house,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	a	total	pain	to	live	in,”	said	Amanda.	“You	can’t	leave	your	stuff	around, and	if	you	should	happen	to	get	lipstick	on	the	crystal	mirrors	in	the	ballroom, well,	you	have	to	spend	all	afternoon	cleaning	it	off.	And	the	heater	in	the	pool breaks.”	Poor,	poor	Amanda. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	I	could	spend	my	money	openly	and	decided	to	build	a	house,	I	would	use Amanda’s	mansion	as	a	guide	to	my	architect.	I’d	take	him	on	a	tour	and	point out	the	various	features:	“Not	like	this.	And	not	like	this.	And	definitely	not	like</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari	was	gulping	his	lemonade	down,	as	if	being	in	the	presence	of	Amanda	was like	getting	too	close	to	the	sun	and	had	dried	out	his	body.	I	motioned	to	him	to slow	down.	Our	plan	required	us	to	spend	a	few	minutes	in	the	house.	“Would you	mind	if	I	used	your	bathroom?”	I	asked.	Amanda	rolled	her	eyes.	“It’s	that way,”	she	said,	pointing	in	the	direction	away	from	the	library	with	its	mantely mantel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	left	Ari	sitting	at	the	table	as	Roger	smirked	and	Amanda	put	her	tanned	legs up	on	the	chair	opposite	her.	I	was	worried	that	this	might	be	too	much	for	my friend,	but	I	had	no	choice.	The	Plan	required	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bathroom	was	about	the	size	of	my	bedroom.	After	standing	there	for	a moment,	inspecting	the	lion-headed	faucet	and	the	framed	photograph	of	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dunn	shaking	hands	with	the	president	of	either	some	large	corporation	or	some small	country,	I	left	the	bathroom	and	purposefully	went	wrong.	After	a	few minutes	of	wandering,	I	made	my	way	into	the	library	and,	slipping	my Terwilliger	Spoon	out	of	its	velvet	sack,	placed	it	onto	the	mantel	of	the	library in	the	stand	that	had	been	created	especially	for	it.	It	looked	perfect,	the	silver shining	like	a	spark	of	fire	in	its	mahogany	frame.	Mission	accomplished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“May	I	help	you?”	came	the	voice	behind	me.	I	whirled	around.	Mr.	Paul	had just	entered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I’m	just	trying	to	find	my	way	back	to	the	veranda.	And	Amanda,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which	way	is	the	hall,	Mr.	Paul?”	I’d	resisted	the	first	time,	but	couldn’t	help myself	the	second. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To	your	left,	go	straight,	turn	right	at	the	potting	room,	and	the	veranda	is	right there.”	After	I	thanked	him,	he	said,	“Don’t	break	the	rake,	Jake.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	he	was	ok. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	rejoined	the	awkward	little	party,	Amanda	was	putting	some	type	of	oil on	her	legs.	Roger	was	spitting	ice	cubes	at	a	garden	gnome.	Ari	was	breathing heavily,	as	if	trying	to	inhale	Amanda	through	his	nose.	I	nodded	at	Ari,	our signal	that	all	had	gone	well	and	said,	“Well,	we	should	be	going.	Let’s	exchange books	and	we’ll	be	on	our	way.”	Amanda	slid	my	book	over	to	me	and	I	gave her	hers.	This	was	Ari’s	cue. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a>He,	of	course,	didn’t	take	it.	He	sat	there	like	a	dog	with	its	head	out	the	window of	a	car,	his	tongue	flapping	in	the	breeze.	“We’ll	be	on	our	way,”	I	said	again, pointedly.	More	silence.	“There’s	just	one	more	thing,”	I	said,	stealing	Ari’s	line, hoping	to	jump	start	him.	“Isn’t	there	just	one	more	thing,	Ari?”	Ari	was supposed	to	say,	“If	you	check	your	library,	you’ll	find	the	Terwilliger	Spoon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead	Ari	said,	“One	more	thing?	What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amanda	interrupted	our	stumbling	little	script.	“Oh,”	she	said,	“by	the	way,	we found	that	stupid	Terwilliger	Spoon	thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	course	it	was	that	moment	that	Ari	chose	to	speak	his	lines:	“If	you	check your	library,	you’ll	find	the	Terwilliger	Spoon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I	know,”	Amanda	said,	looking	at	him	as	if	he	were	an	idiot,	which, technically	speaking,	he	was	being.	“We	found	it	last	week	behind	a	couch	in	the home	theatre.	It	was	just	a	little	scratched	and	dusty,	but	Mr.	Paul’s	been	fixing	it up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	what	exactly	would	Mr.	Paul	-	and	Amanda	-	and	Amanda’s	father!	-	say when	they	found	a	second	Terwilliger	Spoon	proudly	displayed	in	their	library? </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	had	to	grab	the	spoon	before	anyone	noticed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari,	having	gotten	started	on	his	scripted	speech,	was	continuing	to	give	it.	“You see,”	he	said,	“We	recovered	your	spoon	…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ari,”	I	said	sharply,	“I	know	you’re	excited	that	Amanda’s	family	found	the spoon.	Very	excited.	But	there’s	no	need	to	go	on	about	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But…”	said	Ari. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	buts.	We	really	should	be	going.	Must	be	going.	Must	must.”	Then	I	had	an idea.	“Say,	when	do	you	think	Mr.	Paul	will	be	finished	fixing	up	that	old	spoon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’d	love	to	see	it.	Heard	so	much	about	it	and	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I	don’t	know,”	said	Amanda,	without	really	thinking.	“I	think	he	was working	on	it	this	morning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ooh,”	I	said,	clutching	my	stomach.	“Stomach	ache!	Can	I	borrow	your bathroom	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a>Amanda	rolled	her	eyes.	“Whatever.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	headed	down	the	hall	to	the	library	but	made	a	sharp	left	when	I	saw	Mr.	Paul approaching	from	the	opposite	direction.	I	was	now	in	unexplored	territory.	At the	end	of	the	long	corridor	was	some	type	of	big	room	with	ceilings	high enough	to	let	you	raise	a	family	of	falcons.	My	chances	of	being	discovered were	much	greater	in	a	room	that	large	and	open,	so	I	ducked	up	a	small	stairway to	my	left.	Although	it	wasn’t	disguised	or	camouflaged,	the	stairs	were	so	dark that	they	might	as	well	have	been	hidden.	I	walked	up	carefully,	trying	to	keep my	feet	on	the	edge	of	each	step	because	I	read	in	a	spy	book	that	that’s	how	you keep	stairs	from	creaking.	The	spy	book	was	wrong.	But	I	made	it	to	the	top undiscovered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	there	was	Mr.	Dunn’s	private	study.	I	knew	it	was	Mr.	Dunn’s	because	there were	pictures	of	him	on	every	wall:	photos	with	the	mayor,	our	senator,	and	with three	former	presidents,	an	oil	painting	of	him	standing	like	a	king	with	one	hand on	a	globe,	and	photos	from	newspaper	stories	about	his	successes.	I	knew	it	was private	because	there	was	only	one	chair	in	it,	a	green	leather	one	the	size	of	a throne	behind	the	desk.	What	surprised	me	was	that,	based	on	the	Web	page open	on	his	computer	screen,	Mr.	Dunn	was	looking	into	buying	a	dune	buggy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	a	house	of	surprises. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	crept	out	of	the	room	as	quietly	as	I	could	and	came	back	down	the	dark stairway.	By	my	reckoning,	if	I	took	a	series	of	right	turns,	I	should	have	ended up	back	in	the	library.	But	my	reckoning	isn’t	very	good	when	it	comes	to directions.	In	fact,	I	once	got	lost	in	my	own	house,	although	my	parents	had switched	some	pictures	around	so	maybe	it’s	not	as	bad	as	it	sounds.	No,	it	is	as bad	as	it	sounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	series	of	right	turns	down	big	corridors,	I	found	myself	not	in	the	library but	at	a	door	to	the	greenhouse…a	large,	glass-lined	dead	end.	I	turned	around and	saw	what	could	only	be	Mr.	Paul’s	workroom.	The	door	was	open	and	the light	was	off.	It	was	a	small	room,	but	bigger	than	Mr.	Dunn’s	private	office.	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Paul	apparently	was	quite	the	handyman,	for	the	walls	were	lined	with	tools	for working	with	wood,	for	fixing	electronics,	for	shaping	metal	and	for	fiddling with	small	mechanisms	like	watches.	And	there,	in	the	middle	of	the	worktable at	the	center	of	the	room	was	the	Terwilliger	Spoon,	as	shiny	and	Terwilliger-y as	ever. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a>I	heard	footsteps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	moved	in	one	step	and	pretended	to	be	looking	around	for	the	exit	even	though it	was	right	behind	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	footsteps	turned	a	corner	and	got	softer	and	softer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Afraid	that	I	might	be	found	at	any	moment,	without	thinking	I	swiped	the Spoon	and	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	it	safe	in	my	pocket,	I	made	my	way	back	to	the	veranda	where	Ari	was rocking	back	and	forth	on	his	feet,	like	a	tuning	fork.	He	was	apparently	trying to	have	a	relaxed	conversation	with	Amanda.	“Hey,”	I	said,	“We’d	better	be going.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Going.	Got	to	going.	Going,”	said	Ari. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amanda	barely	looked	up	as	she	said,	“Really?	So	soon?	Well,	bye	bye.	Mr.	Paul will	see	you	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	so	we	left	that	house	of	many	corridors	and	too	many	spoons.	When	we were	back	on	the	street,	at	the	end	of	the	long	path	from	their	house	and	safely out	of	view,	I	reached	into	my	pocket	and	pulled	out	the	Terwilliger	Spoon triumphantly.	“Don’t	worry,”	I	said,	“I	got	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me	too,”	said	Ari,	pulling	the	Terwilliger	Spoon	out	of	his	pocket	too.	“I	snuck into	the	library.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	Ari.	Ari	looked	at	me.	Without	thinking	about	it	-	I	was	tired	of thinking	about	it	-	we	both	put	our	spoons	into	the	Dunn’s	mailbox. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	them	figure	it	out,”	I	said	and	we	biked	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	11</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	learned	a	lesson	from	the	disaster	of	the	Terwilliger	Spoon.	In	fact,	I	learned	a few	lessons.	First,	Ari	is	hopeless.	Why	did	he	think	he	had	a	chance	with Amanda?	Amanda	was	hanging	out	with	a	kid	three	years	older	than	her	who confused	muscles	with	personality.	And	what	does	that	say	about	Amanda? </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’d	ditch	Roger	for	a	cardboard	cutout	of	a	guy	with	more	muscles	and	it’d take	her	two	weeks	to	find	out	that	he	wasn’t	real. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Second,	I	learned	that	this	is	just	a	plain	stupid	way	to	spend	my	money.	Thanks to	the	three	thousand	dollars	I	spent,	there	now	existed	a	perfect	copy	of	a	really ugly	spoon.	Ari	wasn’t	happier.	I	wasn’t	happier.	The	world	wasn’t	happier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	had	to	be	a	better	way	to	use	the	money	I’d	been	given. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Third,	I	learned	that	working	in	a	restaurant	is	really	hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	lying	in	bed	the	next	Saturday,	thinking	happily	about	all	the	things	I	could buy	and	then	thinking	unhappily	about	how	I	couldn’t	buy	them	without	lying	to my	parents.	A	new	guitar?	I’d	been	through	that.	A	Segway	scooter?	Where would	I	keep	it	and	where	would	I	ride	it?	Expensive	old	baseball	cards?	My parents	would	probably	never	find	out,	but	I	don’t	care	about	expensive	old baseball	cards.	A	riding	lawn	mower?	A	swimming	pool?	A	pony?	Diamond cufflinks?	I	don’t	have	even	cuffs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	phone	rang. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	for	you,”	my	mother	yelled	up	the	stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	Ari,”	I	said	since	he’s	the	only	one	who	would	call	me	that	early	on	a Saturday	morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	Ari,”	said	the	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mimi!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	it’s	your	forgotten	pal,	Mimi.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>“Oh,	I’m	sorry.	I	was	going	to	come	over	and	see	you	today.	Really.	I’ve	been wrapped	up	with	Ari.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How’d	that	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	went.	It’s	gone.	It	was	stupid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	I	come	over?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.	Right	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	sound	so	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	I	come	over?”	she	insisted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure.	I’ll	get	dressed	and	everything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	took	Mimi	less	than	five	minutes	to	get	here,	a	new	record.	I	met	her downstairs	and	we	went	to	the	swing	set	in	my	backyard.	I’m	too	big	for	it,	but that’s	sort	of	why	I	like	it.	I	feel	my	real	age	in	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	the	rush?”	I	asked	as	Mimi	pumped	her	legs	and	got	some	height	on	the swings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	just	wanted	to	get	out	of	my	house.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	going	on?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knew	that	wasn’t	true. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimi	let	go	of	the	swing	at	its	highest,	sailed	through	the	air,	and	landed	on	our lawn.	That	was	going	to	leave	a	nasty	grass	stain	on	her	butt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	what	do	you	want	to	do?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a>“My	mom	and	dad	are	fighting,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	stinks.	What	about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	mom	wants	to	get	a	job	and	my	dad	doesn’t	want	her	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	your	mom	works	at	the	Sunny	Day	Care	Center.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	does.	Part	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	name	always	bothered	me,”	I	said,	stupidly	interrupting	Mimi’s	flow.	“I mean,	is	it	a	sunny	day	for	the	care	center	or	is	it	sunny	at	the	day	care	center? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shouldn’t	it	really	be	the	Sunny	Day	DayCare	Center?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyway,”	Mimi	said	with	a	point	on	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyway,”	I	said,	acknowledging	that	I’m	an	idiot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	been	working	there	four	days	a	week	for	a	few	hours	while	I’m	at	a school,	but	now	Betty	Freed’s	mom	wants	to	hire	my	mom	to	work	in	her	office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	an	office	manager.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	what’s	the	problem?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	freaked	my	dad	out.	He	says	it’s	really	just	a	fancy	name	for	a	secretary	and that	my	mom	wouldn’t	like	it	as	much	as	working	at	the	day	care	and	she’d	just be	doing	it	for	the	money.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	why	does	your	mom	want	to	do	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	because	we	need	the	money.	That’s	the	part	that’s	freaking	me	out.	I think	my	dad’s	worried	about	getting	fired.	He’s	had	that	job	forever.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	works	at	Dunn	Industries,	doesn’t	he?”	I	asked.	I	never	really	paid	too	much attention	to	what	jobs	my	friends’	parents	had.	After	all,	when	you	hear	the parents	talking	about	work,	they’re	almost	always	complaining	about	people you’ve	never	met.	My	dad’s	different,	but	that’s	because	he’s	a	newspaper	editor which	means	he	covers	interesting	things.	Or	maybe	it’s	just	because	he’s	my dad. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a>“Yeah.	He’s	a	manager	now.	But	he	sounds	like	he	thinks	the	company’s	going	to be	firing	a	whole	bunch	of	people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	would	stink.”	Dunn	Industries	was	the	biggest	company	in	town.	I	was never	sure	exactly	what	they	made,	but	whatever	it	was,	it	took	a	big	factory.	My father	once	explained	that	Dunn	Industries	makes	parts	for	other	factories: machines	that	build	other	machines.	I	of	course	immediately	started	to	wonder who	makes	Dunn	Industries’	machines,	which	would	be	machines	that	build other	machines	for	other	machines.	And	then	who	made	those	machines?	And	so on	until	you	found	the	factory	that	makes	the	machines	that	make	all	the	other machines	for	building	factories.	That’s	where	I’d	want	to	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,”	I	said,	“Want	to	go	to	the	skateboard	park?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah!”	said	Mimi.	“Oh,”	she	added,	the	light	going	out	of	her	eyes,	“I	don’t think	I	can.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	not?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	supposed	to	be	watching	my	money.”	It	cost	$4	to	skateboard	for	an	hour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	problem.	I	think	I’ve	got	some	extra,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Off	we	went,	talking	about	everything	except	Mimi’s	parents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	going	on	with	Dunn	Industries?”	I	asked	my	Dad	as	we	sat	in	the	living room	before	dinner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	heard	they’re	going	to	fire	a	bunch	of	people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	layoff?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know.	What’s	a	layoff?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	a	company	fires	a	bunch	of	people,”	Dad	said,	looking	up	from	his magazine.	“Well,	that’s	interesting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a>“Wouldn’t	that	be	bad	for	the	town?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	sure	wouldn’t	be	good.	Dunn	employs	about	fifteen	percent	of	the	people	in this	town.	If	the	factory	has	a	layoff,	there’ll	be	a	lot	of	people	who	have	no salary	any	more.	And	there	aren’t	that	many	open	jobs	for	people	to	get	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	what	do	people	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	get	unemployment	insurance	for	a	few	months	to	carry	them	over.	But, ultimately,	people	either	find	a	job	or	they	have	to	move	somewhere	else.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	bad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	bad	for	everyone.	It’s	bad	for	the	people.	And	it’s	bad	for	the	town.	When	a town	gets	smaller,	there	are	fewer	people	paying	taxes,	so	the	town	has	less money	to	spend	and	so	it	has	to	cut	back	on	programs	also.	There’s	less	money for	schools,	for	parks,	for	the	library,	to	fix	the	roads…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	sat	for	a	moment,	thinking	about	what	we	might	lose.	I	was	thinking	mainly about	Mimi.	I	would	hate	it	if	she	moved.	It	would	change	the	town	so	much	for me	that	it	would	be	like	 <i class="calibre3">we</i>	moved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’d	you	hear	about	this?”	Dad	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	must	have	been	somewhere.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	feel	right	about	telling	you.	The	person	who	told	me	didn’t	say	it	was	ok to	tell	anyone,	especially	the	editor	of	the	local	paper.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Protecting	your	sources?	That’s	the	first	thing	a	good	newspaper	person	learns to	do.	But	I’m	going	to	look	into	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	must	have	looked	worried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	worry.	I	won’t	let	anyone	know	I	heard	the	rumor	from	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although	I	couldn’t	buy	anything	my	parents	would	notice,	there	were	ways	of spending	money	that	they	wouldn’t	know	about.	For	example,	I	now	got	dessert</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>almost	every	day	at	lunch.	And	my	tropical	fish	tank	was	getting	crowded	with new	citizens,	including	three	I	nicknamed	“Secret,”	“Lee”	and	“Rich.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	afternoon,	I	had	gone	to	the	games	store	and	bought	a	couple	of	new	video games.	I	paid	cash,	of	course.	And	even	though	the	amount	it	cost	me	was	less than	my	money	earned	in	ten	minutes	by	just	sitting	in	the	bank,	it	seemed wrong.	I	could	afford	it,	but	it	still	felt	like	a	waste.	I	almost	walked	out	of	the store	without	buying	anything	when	I	decided	that	having	$100,000,000	and being	too	chicken-hearted	to	buy	even	a	stupid	video	game	or	two	was	an	even bigger	waste.	So,	I	bought	them	and	went	to	Ari’s	to	play	them.	“That’s	a	new game,”	Ari’s	mother	said,	surprising	me.	I	don’t	think	my	parents	know	what games	I	have. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	Jake’s,”	said	Ari,	perfectly	truthfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	turned	out	that	both	games	were	actually	pretty	dumb,	unless	you	can	find yourself	surprised	when	the	same	troll	jumps	out	from	behind	the	same	rock every	time	you’re	forced	to	re-start	a	level,	or	if	your	idea	of	fun	is	moving	down a	mountain	on	jet-powered	skis	that	tend	to	crash	into	trees	no	matter	how carefully	you	steer	them.	I	left	the	games	with	Ari	and	headed	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	a	Friday	night	and	it	seemed	as	if	the	entire	town	was	relaxed	and	looking forward	to	the	weekend.	The	sky	was	turning	that	deep	shade	of	blue	that	is	the color	I	see	in	my	mind	right	before	I	fall	asleep.	There	was	enough	of	a	breeze	to make	soup	a	possibility	but	not	enough	to	slow	down	my	bike.	I’m	not	one	to notice	the	weather	much,	but	that	night	was	an	exception. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because	it	was	a	Friday,	my	father	was	home	with	a	copy	of	his	newspaper.	He had	been	“on	press”	all	day	and	seemed	tired	but	not	annoyed.	I	glanced	at	the headline	and	nearly	blew	my	bubblegum	out	my	nose:	“Dunn	Industries Threatens	Lay	Offs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dad,”	I	said,	“How	could	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	could	I	what,	Jake?”	he	said	like	someone	who	was	looking	forward	to relaxing	only	to	face	accusations	from	his	son.	Which	is	exactly	what	he	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	told	you	about	the	Dunn	Industry	lay	offs	in	private.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	you	did.	And	I	respected	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>“How	can	you	say	that?	Look	at	this	headline!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,	Jake,	I	didn’t	use	anything	you	told	me.	I	went	out	and	gathered	my	own information.	And	it	confirmed	the	rumor	you’d	told	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	information?	How	did	you	find	out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t	tell	you	that	because	then	I’d	be	revealing	 <i class="calibre3">my</i>	sources	and	I	can’t	do	that just	like	you	didn’t	reveal	your	source.	But,	I	called	some	people	I	know	at	Dunn Industries,	and	they	talked	to	me	off	the	record.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	that	mean?”	I	asked	as	if	there	couldn’t	be	any	possible	sense	to	such	a stupid	phrase.	I	was	so	angry	that	I	was	willing	to	set	myself	up	to	look	really dumb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	means	that	they	agreed	to	talk	with	me	only	if	I	promised	not	to	reveal who	they	are.	And	I	won’t.	But	they’re	good	sources	and	I	think	the	story	is	true. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	I	think	you	did	a	good	thing	telling	me	about	it.	It’s	good	for	the	town	to know	what	Dunn	is	up	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	feel	good	about	it.	And	I	didn’t	feel	any	better	about	it	on	Saturday	when Mimi	called	to	tell	me	that	her	father	had	been	fired. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	12</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	terrible,”	I	said	to	Mimi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	why’d	you	do	it?”	she	said	in	a	voice	that	was	angry	after	crying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	your	father.	Do	you	know	how	bad	this	is?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	tell	him.	Not	exactly.	Can	I	come	over?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	a	good	time.	My	parents	are	really,	really	upset.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would	you	meet	me	outside?	Just	for	a	few	minutes?	I’d	really	like	to	talk	with you.”	I	felt	like	this	was	more	for	me	than	for	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine,”	she	said.	“Meet	me	by	the	gnome.”	For	the	first	few	years	I’d	thought	the plaster	gnome	in	her	yard	was	scary.	Then	I	thought	it	was	cute.	Now	I	thought	it was	ridiculous.	But	this	didn’t	seem	the	time	to	bring	it	up	with	Mimi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	raced	there	on	my	bike.	As	I	was	hopping	off,	she	was	coming	out	her	front door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So?”	she	asked	the	way	someone	points	a	finger	at	a	dog	that’s	been	bad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	I	did	tell	my	father.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	could	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	told	him	confidentially.	He	didn’t	use	what	I	told	him.	He	went	out	and found	other	people	to	talk	with.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	other	people?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	picked	up	some	of	the	gravel	around	the	gnome	and	threw	it	at	the	big	oak	tree in	the	middle	of	Mimi’s	yard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	do	that,”	she	said.	Her	parents	didn’t	like	it.	Somehow,	I	was	reassured</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a>by	her	criticizing	me	this	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	wouldn’t	tell	me	because	those	sources	were	confidential	also.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	Mr.	Dunn	is	convinced	it	was	my	father	who	told.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know.	My	parents	are	so	upset	that	they’re	not	making	a	lot	of	sense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Dunn	only	told	a	few	people.	My	father	was	one	of	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	should	tell	Mr.	Dunn	it	didn’t	come	from	your	father.	My	father	will	tell him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	wouldn’t	matter.	Dad’s	already	given	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	that’s	dumb,”	I	said.	Mimi	shot	me	a	look	as	if	I’d	just	said	that	her	father was	dumb.	“No,	not	dumb	dumb,”	I	explained.	“Just,	like,	well,	he	should	keep trying.	I	bet	my	father	can	get	him	his	job	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would	he	tell	Mr.	Dunn	who	his	source	was?”	I	shook	my	head.	“So	what	good would	it	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	was	mowing	a	lawn	as	the	sun	went	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	what’s	going	to	happen,”	said	Mimi	finally.	“What	do	you	do when	your	father	is	out	of	work	and	your	mother	works	part	time?	How	do	you have	enough	money	for	food,	and	a	car,	and	heating?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	dad	says	you	get	uninsurance	employment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Unemployment	insurance,”	Mimi	corrected.	“But	I	don’t	think	that	lasts	very long.”	We	could	hear	plates	being	rattled	in	Mimi’s	house	as	they	were	put	away from	dinner.	“I	guess	Mom	will	take	that	job	after	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	guess.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	next	to	my	friend	Mimi,	waiting	for	her	to	cry.	She	didn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a>My	dad	was	reading	a	biography	of	Winston	Churchill,	the	British	wartime leader	who	said	so	many	witty	things	that	every	ten	minutes	Dad	would	chuckle and	read	us	something	from	the	book.	Apparently,	Churchill	also	had	a	terrible British	accent.	My	mother	was	knitting.	The	clack	of	her	needles	was	like	the sound	of	a	fast	typist.	She	is	a	knitting	demon.	“That’s	how	I	got	through	grad school	courses,”	she	liked	to	say.	Maddie	was	playing	a	game	of	solitaire	using	a deck	with	pictures	of	witches,	ogres,	fairies	and	the	occasional	frog	wearing	a prince’s	crown.	I	like	it	when	she	plays	solitaire	because	then	she’s	not	asking me	to	play. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Want	to	play?”	Maddie	asked	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	you	were	playing	solitaire.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	but	there’s	a	way	to	play	two-person.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	later,”	I	said.	By	“later”	I	meant	“When	the	sun	is	flickering	out	because it’s	run	out	of	fuel	and	the	universe	has	collapsed	into	a	dot	the	size	of	your brain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	too	busy	thinking	about	what	Mimi	had	asked:	“What	do	you	do	when your	father	is	out	of	work	and	your	mother	works	part	time?”	I	realized	now	that that	was	the	wrong	question.	The	right	one	is:	“What	do	you	do	when	your	father is	out	of	work	and	your	mother	works	part	time	and	you	have	a	friend	who	has $100	million	in	the	bank?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	supposed	to	hang	out	with	Ari	on	Saturday,	but	I	called	him	and	said	that	I needed	to	spend	some	quality	time	with	Mimi.	He’s	a	good	enough	friend	that	he didn’t	act	all	hurt	and	make	me	feel	bad	about	it.	“Do	you	want	me	to	come	with you?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	think	it’ll	be	better	if	it’s	just	me,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	a	beautiful,	sunny	Saturday.	There	weren’t	any	flowers	yet,	but	you	could smell	the	earth	getting	ready.	I	walked	through	out	small	front	yard	and	saw	the two	weekly	local	papers	stacked	next	to	one	another	on	a	chair	on	our	porch.	I took	them	to	the	swing.	The	headline	in	 <i class="calibre3">The</i>	 <i class="calibre3">Gaz</i>	was	“Dunn	Industries	Denies Report	It	Is	to	Lay	Off	Dozens.”	There	was	a	picture	of	Mr.	Dunn	denying	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a>report,	looking	rather	splendid	in	his	suit	and	perfect	hair.	The	other	headlines reported	on	a	drop	in	the	testing	scores	at	the	high	school,	a	local	author	whose book	won	an	award,	and	a	controversy	over	one	of	the	gas	stations	whose gasoline	fumes	were	disturbing	the	neighbors. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The	Boynton	County	Register</i>,	Mr.	Dunn’s	paper,	had	a	very	different	set	of headlines:</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Eat	Your	Way	to	Slim!”:</p>
<p class="calibre1">(A	diet	clinic	in	town	is	having	a	sale.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Up	on	the	Roof!”:</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Mr.	Emmet	Birdsall	was	cleaning	his	roof’s	gutters	when	 <i class="calibre3">The</i>	 <i class="calibre3">Register</i>‘s photographer	happened	by.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">If	I	had	to	explain	my	problem	with	 <i class="calibre3">The</i>	 <i class="calibre3">Register</i>	in	a	sentence,	it’d	be:	too	many exclamation	points,	not	enough	news.	I	couldn’t	read	 <i class="calibre3">The</i>	 <i class="calibre3">Register</i>	without becoming	more	proud	of	my	father.  <i class="calibre3">The</i>	 <i class="calibre3">Gaz</i>	was	so	much	better.	I	put	both newspapers	on	the	porch	and	walked	to	Mimi’s	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Mimi	answered	my	knock	on	the	door,	she	did	the	opposite	of	inviting	me in.	She	stepped	outside,	even	though	she	didn’t	have	shoes	on,	and	made	it	clear</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a>that	she	didn’t	want	me	going	in.	Through	the	kitchen	window	I	could	see	her father	in	a	bathrobe.	He	didn’t	look	happy	and	I	guessed	that	seeing	the	son	of the	editor	who	got	him	fired	wouldn’t	have	made	him	any	happier.	Seeing	her father	made	me	especially	appreciate	Mimi’s	willingness	to	hang	out	with	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How’s	it	going?”	I	asked,	stupidly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know.	The	same,”	Mimi	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	wondering	if	you	wanted	to	sell	choco-bricks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	dunno.	Yeah,	maybe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Choco-bricks	were	small	fake	bricks	made	of	chocolate	that	we	were	supposed to	be	selling	to	raise	money	for	the	school	extension	program.	Our	middle	school was	getting	too	small	-	or,	“Kids	Are	Bustin’	Out!”	as	 <i class="calibre3">The</i>	 <i class="calibre3">Register</i>	might	put	it	-</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	we	were	sent	out	to	raise	money.	I	wondered	how	much	the	company	that made	the	crummy	Choco-bricks	and	the	donation	cards	and	all	the	rest	of	it made	out	of	us	poor	student	slaves	who	were	supposed	to	be	happy	spending	our Saturday	selling	candy	that	no	one	wants	just	so	we	can	earn	our	little	flashlight or	compass,	depending	on	how	far	up	the	“Choco-Brick	Super	Sales	Pyramid” </p>
<p class="calibre1">we	went. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	it	beat	moping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	Mimi	went	into	her	house	and	got	her	Choco-Brick-o-Kit,	biked	to	my	house where	I	grabbed	mine,	and	we	headed	over	to	the	U-Do-It	parking	lot	thinking that	people	spending	money	on	household	renovations	would	probably	feel guilty	about	turning	down	two	cute	kids	like	me	and	Mimi.	Well,	Mimi’s	cute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	handsome	in	a	rugged	way.	(Yeah,	right.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Did	you	ever	want	to	be	invisible?	Then	come	to	the	parking	lot	at	the	U-Do-It lot	with	a	bunch	of	Choco-bricks	to	sell.	People	wheeled	their	carts	through	the lot	as	if	their	shoes	were	about	to	burst	into	flame.	And	they	were	big	carts, designed	to	fit	wall	panels,	beams	big	enough	to	hold	up	a	living	room,	and	even an	entire	fireplace	that	looked	real	on	the	outside	but	on	the	inside	was	made	of the	same	plastic	as	Maddie’s	backyard	slide.	And	it	turns	out	that	people	who have	just	bought	wall	panels,	living	room	beams,	and	fake	fireplaces	are	too focused	on	getting	home	and	getting	to	work	to	buy	lousy	candy	from	two extremely	cute	eighth	graders. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>We	tried	every	trick	in	the	book: <i class="calibre3">The	Standard	Approach</i>:	We	go	up	to	a	stranger	and	say	in	a	cheerful	voice,	“Hi! </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’re	selling	bricks	of	chocolate	to	help	raise	money	for	real	bricks	so	we	can build	new	classrooms	for	our	school.	They’re	only	$5	and	…”	That’s	about	as far	as	we	got	with	most	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The	Pity	Approach</i>:	We	look	at	the	ground	and	shuffle	our	feet	while	trying	to catch	the	eye	of	a	shopper.	“We’re	having	a	lot	of	trouble	raising	money	for	our school.	There	just	isn’t	enough	room…”	Mimi	was	better	at	this	than	me,	maybe because	when	I	try	to	act	sad	it	comes	out	as	being	angry. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The	Entertainment	Approach</i>:	Mimi	says,	“We’re	selling	bricks…”	and	I	pretend to	interrupt	with	“But	they’re	not	real	bricks…”	and	then	she	says,	“You	can	eat these	bricks…”	and	I	say,	“Eat	bricks?	How	can	that	be,	Mimi.”	And	she	says, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“These	are	chocolate	bricks,	Jake!	Deee-licious!”	And	I	say,	“I	bet	it’s	for	a	good cause.”	And	she	says,	“And	how…”	and	that’s	about	when	the	shopper	would turn	away	like	a	person	changing	the	dial	on	an	obnoxious	TV	show. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The	Honest	Approach</i>:	We	walk	up	quickly	to	a	shopper.	Mimi	stands	on	the	left and	I	stand	on	the	right	so	they	have	no	way	to	escape	except	by	backing	up which	is	hard	to	do	if	you	have	a	cart	filled	with	wall	panels	and	fake	fireplaces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	raising	money	for	our	school,”	Mimi	says.	“We’re	selling	these	blocks	of chocolate,”	I	say.	“They	taste	bad	and	they’re	over-priced,	but	it’s	for	a	really good	cause.”	That	was	our	most	effective	technique.	With	it,	we	sold	close	to four	choco-bricks	in	an	hour,	if	you	count	two	as	being	close	to	four. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimi	and	I	sat	on	the	curb	and	counted	our	receipts.	One	two.	Then	we	double checked.	One	two.	We	added	up	the	money	we	had	made.	Ten	dollars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know,”	I	said,	“this	is	ridiculous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	mean	trying	to	sell	chocolate	bricks	to	people	who	are	buying	ant	poison for	their	house?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	what	I	mean.	I	figured	out	how	much	interest	I	make.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	mean	like	the	interest	I	make	every	year	on	my	bank	account?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.	What	do	you	make	in	a	year?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a>“Last	year	I	made	about	four	dollars.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	make	$16,438.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow!	You	get	that	in	a	year	for	doing	nothing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	sorry,	Mimi.	That’s	how	much	interest	I	make	every	day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	day??”	She	was	practically	shouting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yup.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	$600	an	hour!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually,	it’s	almost	$700	an	hour.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	my	gosh,	Jake.	You’re	rich!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Weird,	isn’t	it?	And	could	you	keep	it	down	a	little?”	A	couple	carrying	bags full	of	electrical	parts	had	turned	to	look.	I’m	sure	they	thought	I’d	found	fifty cents	on	the	ground	or	something.	“I	am	seriously	rich,”	I	said	to	Mimi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	what	are	we	doing	standing	here	selling	stupid	Choco-bricks	to	people	who don’t	want	them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Having	fun?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	wish,”	she	said.	“How	much	do	you	think	the	entire	school	earns	from selling	stupid	Choco-bricks?”	We’d	grown	to	think	of	“stupid	Choco-bricks”	as one	word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	we	made	$1,500	or	so	last	year.	And	that	was	a	good	year.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jake,	you	make	that	in	two	hours	doing	nothing.	Why	have	we	been	standing out	here	making	fools	of	ourselves?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	most	of	that	$1,500	goes	to	the	Choco-brick	company,	I’m	sure.”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’d	be	better	off	just	giving	it	straight	to	the	school.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimi	flipped	the	brim	of	her	hat	up.	“I	am	now	out	of	the	stupid	Choco-brick business	for	good.”	She	looked	at	me.	“Depending,	of	course,	on	how	generous</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a>you’re	feeling.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	many	Choco-bricks	do	you	want	to	have	sold?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	hundred?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	one	will	believe	a	hundred.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ok,	fifty.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’d	make	you	the	class	leader.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	ok	with	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	worries	me	a	little.	How	about	45?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ok.	And	how	many	are	you	going	to	sell	yourself?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	greedy.	How	about	35?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Make	it	38.	I	don’t	want	to	beat	you	by	that	much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	we	do	with	the	chocolate?”	Mimi	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	you’re	about	to	buy	44	bars	from	me.	What	do	I	do	with	44	bars	of chocolate?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“First,	we	eat	one.”	I	took	two	from	my	box	and	handed	one	to	Mimi.	We unwrapped	the	bars	halfway	and	held	them	carefully.	The	chocolate	was	limp from	having	sat	in	the	sun.	We	ate	quickly.	They	were	bad.	And	for	this	we	were overcharging	people? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	held	up	my	half-finished	bar.	“I	am	done.	I’m	more	than	done.	I’m	overdone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimi	held	hers	upside	down	and	watched	the	gooey	chocolate	run	onto	the	edge of	the	parking	lot.	“Yuch.	For	this	we’re	overcharging	people?”	(Mimi	had	the habit	of	saying	what	I	was	thinking.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">We	stood	up	with	the	boxes	of	bars	under	our	arms.	As	we	got	on	our	bikes,	we</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>saw	a	familiar	boy	bicycling	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,”	said	Ari,	“How’s	the	fishing	here?	Sold	many?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	sold	45,”	said	Mimi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	sold	38,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow!”	said	Ari.	“This	must	be	the	best	spot	in	the	entire	town!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,”	I	said,	“But	you	have	to	have	the	right	technique.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,”	said	Mimi.	“We	had	no	luck	until	we	talked	in	a	French	accent,”	she explained,	demonstrating	her	technique.	Mimi’s	French	accent	sounded	like	a cartoon	mouse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Zat’s	right,”	I	said	in	my	own	unique	French.	“Ze	custom-airs	zeem	to	lahk	it bettah	if	zey	t’ink	you	har	an	exchahnge	‘tudent.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow!”	said	Ari	again.	“Thanks!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	all	for	watching	him	try	it	but	Mimi	didn’t	have	the	heart	and	told	him	the truth.	Ari	sold	39	boxes	that	afternoon,	and	it	only	took	him	about	fifteen seconds.	With	no	French	accent. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	13</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	feel	good	about	dreading	Helpful	Citizen	day.	But	that’s	the	truth:	I definitely	wasn’t	looking	forward	to	it.	Oakes	School	thinks,	“No	education	is complete	without	service.”	Or,	as	the	t-shirts	said,	“Helpful	Citizen	Day: Learning	to	give	a	helping	hand.”	There	was	a	picture	of	a	big	hand	reaching down	to	take	a	little	hand,	drawn	in	a	childish	way,	which	would	have	been better	if	a	child	had	actually	drawn	it.	Whenever	I	see	grownup	pictures	drawn	to look	like	children	did	them,	with	stick	figures	and	houses	that	have	their perspective	all	wrong,	I	feel	like	they’re	making	fun	of	us.	We’re	just	kids.	We would	draw	better	if	we	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	the	drawing	wasn’t	what	bothered	me	about	the	day.	I	have	nothing	against doing	volunteer	work.	For	example,	I	participate	in	the	Keep	Us	Green	day, planting	flowers	along	the	roads.	And	I	sort	recyclables	a	couple	times	a	year down	at	the	dump.	That’s	fun,	especially	the	part	where	you	get	to	throw	the glass	bottles	into	the	big	hopper	and	watch	them	break.	But	being	forced	to volunteer	makes	as	much	sense	to	me	as	being	forced	to	play.	It’s	not	play	if you’re	forced,	and	it’s	not	volunteering	if	you	have	no	choice	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	make	it	worse,	I	was	put	in	the	group	going	to	the	Senior	Recreational	Center attached	to	Dunn	Village,	a	block	of	apartments	Mr.	Dunn	rented	mainly	to	old people.	I	don’t	know	what	to	say	to	old	people,	unless	I	know	them,	like	my grandparents	or	Mrs.	Fordgythe.	Meeting	anyone	for	the	first	time	and	having	to have	a	“pleasant	chat”	is	just	hard	for	me.	And,	judging	from	Ari	and	Mimi’s reactions,	hard	for	them,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	least	we’d	all	been	assigned	to	the	same	group.	On	the	other	hand,	I	would rather	have	been	assigned	to	the	group	painting	the	fence	at	the	park	or	the	group doing	the	gardening	at	the	long-term	care	section	of	the	hospital.	I	did	manage	to get	out	of	the	petting	zoo	job.	All	the	other	students	thought	it	was	the	best	of	all the	volunteer	offerings,	but	I’d	heard	from	a	good	source	(my	older	cousin	Max) that	instead	of	hanging	around	the	cute	ponies	and	lambs	the	way	you	imagine, you	have	to	shovel	stuff.	Say	no	more.	So	when	the	kids	who	were	assigned	to the	zoo	found	out	about	it	and	pumped	their	fists	and	said	“Yes!”	it	was	all	I could	do	not	to	laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	six	of	us	in	the	Senior	Center	group,	led	by	the	too-perky	Ms.	Floyd, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a>our	math	teacher.	I	used	to	think	that	Ms.	Floyd	was	cheery	on	purpose	to counter	the	bad	mood	of	her	students	since	most	students	don’t	like	math	class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	like	a	dentist	who	knows	that	she’s	about	to	hurt	you	so	she	talks	in	a	high-pitched	voice	and	smiles	as	she	says,	“This	may	hurty-wurty	just	an	eensy-weensy	bit.”	The	higher	the	voice	and	the	younger	the	baby	talk,	the	more trouble	you’re	in.	Helpful	Citizen	Day	changed	my	mind	about	Ms.	Floyd.	But	I don’t	want	to	get	ahead	of	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	realized	that	the	day	was	not	going	to	go	quite	as	smoothly	as	planned	as	we were	unloading	the	minivan	that	brought	us.	We	pulled	up	into	the	semi-circular driveway	and	even	before	the	van	stopped,	three	senior	citizens	-	actually,	do you	mind	if	I	just	call	them	“old	people”	from	now	on?	-	were	coming	out	the door	to	great	us.	One	was	the	organizer,	Mrs.	Muldauer.	Behind	her	were	an	old man	and	an	old	woman.	They	all	seemed	so	glad	to	see	us.	All	the	kids	went around	to	the	back	of	the	van	as	Ms.	Floyd	used	both	hands	to	shake	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Muldauer’s	hand,	leaning	in,	smiling	even	more	broadly	than	usual.	As	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Muldauer	introduced	her	two	companions,	we	were	pulling	easels	out	of	the	van. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	say	“we,”	I	mean	Mimi,	Ari	and	me	along	with	Halley	Jackson,	a	girl who	was	always	always	always	enthusiastic.	When	I	say	“we,”	I	definitely	do not	mean	Amanda	and	Lydia	who	were	less	happy	about	being	in	our	group	than we	were	to	have	them.	They	stood	near	enough	to	the	door	of	the	van	to	look like	maybe	they	were	about	to	do	something	without	actually	doing	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	fine.	(Well,	not	really.)	There	wasn’t	all	that	much	to	carry.	What	wasn’t fine	was	when	Mrs.	Muldauer	came	up	to	us	to	greet	us.	She	introduced	her companions	as	Bill	Tidewater	and	Felicia	Markson.	We	all	said	hello	to	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tidewater	and	Ms.	Markson,	except	for	Amanda	who	made	a	point	of	referring to	them	as	Bill	and	Felicity.	Even	if	Amanda	had	gotten	Ms.	Markson’s	first name	right,	it	wouldn’t	have	been	fine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	here’s	the	real	giveaway.	When	Mr.	Tidewater	said,	“Can	I	give	you	a hand?”	Amanda	said	“Yeah,”	and	handed	him	some	poster	board	signs	to	carry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Definitely	not	fine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Halley	stepped	in	before	anyone	else	could	and	said,	“Oh,	thanks	for	offering, but	I	can	grab	those.”	Halley	was	already	carrying	two	boxes	of	games	and	a grocery	bag	with	cookies,	but	that	didn’t	stop	her.	Amanda	went	right	ahead	and handed	Halley	the	poster	boards.	“Thanks,”	said	Halley.	“Thanks	so	much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a>Throughout	this	entire	interaction,	Ari	stood	there,	studying	Amanda	like	a	boy taking	an	eye	exam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Senior	Center	looked	on	the	outside	like	a	mansion.	The	front	porch	had marble	pillars,	and	ivy	had	grown	up	the	walls.	But,	when	I	brushed	against	one of	the	pillars	I	discovered	that	they	were	wood	painted	to	look	like	marble.	And the	brick	walls	behind	the	ivy	were	stained	black	from	soot,	except	where	they were	crumbling,	revealing	fresher	orange	brick	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	front	entrance	opened	into	a	large	room	with	a	linoleum	floor	that	was scuffed	and	dirty,	and	even	sagged	in	spots.	Long	cafeteria	tables	were	spread out,	some	with	plastic	tablecloths.	No	two	table	cloths	matched.	In	fact,	one looked	exactly	like	the	shower	curtain	in	our	upstairs	bathroom	at	home.	Off	to the	left	and	to	the	right	were	smaller	rooms	for	various	activities,	including	one with	game	boards	set	up	for	chess	and	checkers,	one	with	a	small	TV	placed	in	a piece	of	furniture	designed	for	a	much	larger	set,	and	a	room	with	a	couple	of computers	in	it.	Ari	and	I	looked	at	one	another.	We	knew	where	we’d	be	going first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	was	interested	in	the	layout	of	the	building	for	another	reason.	I	had brought	with	me	an	ordinary	looking	envelope.	It	was	surprising	how	small	a stack	$10,000	can	make	when	you	get	it	in	thousand	dollar	bills. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ms.	Floyd	gathered	us	together	and	said,	“Why	don’t	you	all	just	make yourselves	at	home	here	for	the	first	hour	or	so?	Meet	the	people,	make	some new	friends,	and	then	let’s	get	back	together	at	10:15	sharp.	See	that	clock	on	the wall?”	It	was	an	ancient	dial	clock,	not	in	the	“beautiful	and	old”	sense	but	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">“scratched	and	should	have	been	replaced	ten	years	ago”	sense.	“So	you	all	be punctual.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimi	moved	immediately	to	a	table	in	the	main	room	where	a	woman	was looking	through	a	photo	album.	Ari	and	I	headed	for	the	computer	room.	There were	two	old	people	in	it.	Neither	was	using	a	computer.	And	we	could	see	why. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	computers	were	ancient	in	the	“did	they	ever	really	make	computers	this bad?”	sense.	The	screens	only	showed	16	colors.	The	machines	had	5.25”	floppy drives,	which	meant	that	the	only	software	they	could	run	had	to	have	been	made fifteen	years	ago.	And	the	only	connection	these	machines	had	ever	had	to	a	web was	one	left	by	a	spider. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a>Ari	and	I	had	been	hoping	that	the	computers	would	give	us	an	easy	way	to	talk with	the	old	guys.	We	could	show	them	some	of	our	favorite	Web	sites,	teach them	how	to	play	checkers	on	line,	introduce	them	to	the	idea	of	mailing	lists that	talk	about	whatever	it	is	that	old	people	like	to	talk	about.	Now	the	easy	path of	discussion	was	closed	off.	I	swallowed,	turned	to	the	old	person	nearest	me, and	started	a	conversation	the	hard	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,”	I	said.	“My	name	is	Jake.	“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	Jake.	I’m	Thomas	Sadler.	It’s	a	pleasure	to	meet	you,”	was	the	reply.	So, the	direct	approach	worked.	In	fact,	it	worked	a	lot	better	than	Ari’s	approach.	I heard	him	say,	“Hey,	well,	hey.”	Fortunately,	the	man	he	was	addressing	was better	at	this	than	Ari.	“Hello,”	said	the	man,	“My	name	is	Frederick	Hallstadt.	I see	you	like	computers…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Sadler	and	I	talked	about	the	book	he	was	reading.	It	was	a	western,	not	a type	of	novel	I	particularly	cared	for.	I	prefer	books	with	swords,	magic	and chain	mail.	But	it	turned	out	that	Mr.	Sadler	read	cowboy	novels	because	he liked	to	see	how	wrong	they	were.	He	had	been	a	cowboy	for	a	few	years	when he	was	a	young	man.	And	to	answer	your	question	before	you	ask	it:	No,	he didn’t	strap	a	six-shooter	onto	his	leg	and	have	shoot-outs	with	bad	guys	in	black hats.	“Sometimes	they	wore	gray	hats	or	white	hats,	or	even	once	an	orange	golf hat,”	Mr.	Sadler	said.	“Just	kidding,”	he	added.	Mr.	Sadler,	dressed	in	a	faded checked	shirt,	did	look	a	little	like	an	old	cowboy.	Only	one	thing	was	out	of place	for	an	old	cowboy:	a	handkerchief	neatly	folded	in	his	shirt’s	breast pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although	Mr.	Sadler	was	in	the	computer	room	because	he	could	talk	with	his friend	Mr.	Hallstadt	without	disturbing	anyone	else,	he	was	interested	in computers.	He	asked	me	a	lot	of	questions	about	the	Internet.	He	had	a	grandson across	the	country	who	wanted	to	send	him	email,	and	some	of	his	old	friends	in different	parts	of	the	country	had	told	him	that	they	were	staying	in	touch through	instant	messaging.	And	he	wanted	to	know	if	our	congresswoman answered	email	because	he	was	very	upset	about	the	cutbacks	in	funding	for education.	I	thanked	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	I	knew	it,	the	ancient	clock	in	the	other	room,	which	I	could	see	through the	doorway,	said	that	our	hour	was	up.	I	got	up	and	interrupted	Ari	to	let	him know.	Actually,	I	interrupted	Mr.	Hallstadt.	Apparently	Ari	had	managed	to	get</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a>him	really	irritated;	from	what	I	could	overhear,	it	had	something	to	do	with Ari’s	tendency	to	say,	“Well,	if	you	say	so,”	whenever	he	didn’t	have	an	opinion on	a	topic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Predictably,	Amanda	and	Lydia	kept	us	waiting.	The	rest	of	us	sat	at	the	table with	my	family’s	shower	curtain	on	it,	chatting	about	the	people	we	met.	Mimi had	talked	with	a	group	of	three	women	who	had	known	one	another	for	over sixty	years,	two	of	whom	had	disliked	each	other	for	over	fifty	years.	The morning	light	came	through	a	set	of	large	windows	on	the	far	wall.	A	string	of letters	that	spelled	out	“Happy	Birthday”	was	taped	across	the	center	windows, and	bits	of	tape	from	decades	of	other	signs	blotched	the	glass	here	and	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	the	light	was	strong	and	bright	enough	for	me	to	notice	the	little	specks	of dust	floating	everywhere,	like	confetti	at	a	parade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fifteen	minutes	later,	Amanda	and	Lydia	came	in	from	a	back	door	that	led	to the	outside.	I	saw	Lydia	stuffing	a	little	plastic	bag	from	the	Sweet	Nothings clothing	store	into	her	backpack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	must	have	gotten	lost	talking	to	these	wonderful	people,”	Ms.	Floyd	said	to Amanda	and	Lydia.	Don’t	do	that,	I	thought.	Don’t	make	up	their	excuses	for them.	At	least	let	us	see	what	they’d	come	up	with.	“Well,	let’s	try	to	keep	to	our schedule,	ok?	And	the	next	thing	is	what	we’re	really	here	for:	life	stories.”	She paused,	as	if	we	were	supposed	to	clap	our	hands	in	joy.	“Everyone	take	a notebook	and	if	you	forgot	a	pen,	I	brought	some	extras.”	Amanda	and	Lydia took	pens.	“Now,	each	of	you	is	going	to	find	a	senior	and	help	him	or	her	write his	or	her	life	story.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	long	does	it	have	to	be?”	asked	Amanda</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll	have	an	hour	and	a	half,”	said	Ms.	Floyd.	Amanda	rolled	her	eyes.	“So keep	track	of	the	time	to	make	sure	you	get	all	the	way	through.	You’re	not going	to	write	the	life	story	now.	You’re	just	going	to	take	notes.	We’ll	write	up the	final	version	back	at	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lydia	said,	“That’s	not	fair.”	Amanda	popped	her	bubblegum	in	agreement.	I could	read	what	she	was	thinking:	Lend	a	Helping	Hand	Day	wasn’t	supposed	to include	homework. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ms.	Floyd	seemed	to	have	read	the	same	message.	“Your	English	teachers	have agreed	to	count	this	as	a	writing	project.”	We	had	to	write	six	projects	over	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>course	of	the	year.	“Now,	there’s	one	more	thing.	I	don’t	want	this	to	be	just	‘I was	born	in	19-something	and	then	we	moved	to	wherever	in	19-something-else and	then	I	went	to	school.’	I	want	you	each	to	get	one	great	story	from	each senior.	One	thing	in	their	lives	that	makes	a	great	story.	So,	you’ll	have	notes about	all	the	important	events	in	their	lives	but	you’ll	have	one,	long	piece	that tells	this	great	story.	Everyone	understand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari	asked,	“So	the	rest	of	it	should	just	be	dates	and	places?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	said	Ms.	Floyd,	“but	it’s	a	good	question.”	No,	it	wasn’t.	“You	should write	the	whole	biography	as	if	it	were	story,	not	just	places	and	dates.	We	want these	Life	Stories	to	tell	the	truth	about	their	lives	in	a	way	that	the	seniors themselves	would	recognize.	Ok?	Then	let’s	go.	We’ll	meet	back	here	in	an	hour and	a	half.	Oh,	and	we’ll	be	reading	the	stories	at	the	cupcake	social	after	lunch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari	and	I	went	back	into	the	computer	room	where	Mr.	Sadler	and	Mr.	Halstadt were	talking.	Ari	whispered	to	me,	“Can	we	both	do	one	guy?”	I	shook	my	head and	sat	next	to	Mr.	Sadler.	Through	the	door,	I	could	see	Ms.	Floyd	hustling Amanda	and	Lydia	along.	Now	she	was	shaking	her	head	and	telling	the	girls	to go	in	different	directions;	apparently,	they,	like	Ari,	were	hoping	to	double-team an	old	person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Sadler,”	I	said,	“I’d	like	to	write	up	your	autobiography.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me?”	he	asked	in	surprise,	adjusting	the	handkerchief	in	his	pocked.	“I	haven’t done	anything	worth	writing	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I’m	sure	that’s	not	true,”	I	said,	having	no	idea	if	that	was	true	or	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Besides,	we	only	have	an	hour	and	a	half	to	take	notes.	Then	I’ll	write	it	up after	we	leave.	So,	it	will	really	be	just	a	quick	overview.	But,	I	need	to	have	one really	good	story.	We’re	going	to	read	them	after	our	little	party	here	this afternoon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	good	story?	I	don’t	know.	I	can’t	think	of	any.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	don’t	we	just	start	from	the	beginning	and	get	down	the	basics	of	your life?	And	we	can	worry	about	the	story	afterwards.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	not	much	to	tell…” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>Hah! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Sadler	-	Thomas	Beecham	Sadler	-	was	born	in	1917.	“I	was	raised	by	my grandparents	after	my	father	died	when	I	was	three.	Grandma	and	Grandpa moved	in	and	my	mother	never	really	got	her	bearings	back.	Grandma	and Grandpa	were	wonderful	folks.	Grandma	taught	herself	to	read	when	she	was	a child,	and	when	she	met	Grandpa	when	he	was	fifteen,	she	taught	him	how	to read,	too.”	He	paused	to	let	me	catch	up	with	my	note	taking,	adding	casually, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	were	born	slaves,	you	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	words	didn’t	hit	me	until	a	few	seconds	after	he	said	them.	“Slaves?”	I asked.	It	didn’t	seem	possible	that	in	the	21st	century	I	could	be	talking	to someone	who	actually	knew	slaves.	But	I	did	the	math	mentally.	They	could have	been	five	or	even	ten	years	old	at	the	end	of	the	Civil	War.	“That’s amazing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes	it	is.	In	fact,	you	see	how	I	wear	a	handkerchief	like	this	in	my	breast pocket?	That’s	because	my	grandpa	taught	me	that	a	gentleman	always	has	a handkerchief	neatly	folded	and	ready.	And	I’ve	always	believed	that	he	picked that	up	from	his	master.	So,	you’re	seeing	a	slave	master’s	manners	displayed	in the	grandson	of	a	slave.	I	do	it	on	purpose.	It’s	a	reminder.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	fact,”	Mr.	Sadler	said,	“it	played	a	part	in	the	story	of	how	I	met	one	of	the richest	men	in	the	West.”	And	then	Mr.	Sadler	told	me	the	story…</p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	the	worst	of	the	Great	Depression.	Mr.	Sadler	-	or	Beech,	as	he	was known	then	-	was	a	teenager	in	Chicago.	His	family	had	already	been	on	the edge	of	poverty.	Now	the	great	waves	of	unemployment	pushed	them	over	the edge.	Before,	everyone	in	the	family,	including	the	children,	had	to	work	to	bring in	enough	money	for	food,	but	now	there	just	wasn’t	any	work.	When	Beech’s father	got	laid	off,	the	family	decided	that	Beech,	as	the	eldest,	should	go	where the	jobs	were.	So,	Beech	headed	out	west.	He	was	sixteen,	had	a	few	dollars	in his	pocket,	not	much	more	than	the	clothes	he	was	wearing,	and	no	idea	of where	he	would	go.	His	only	two	comforts	were	that	his	best	friend,	Dill	“Pink” </p>
<p class="calibre1">McDaniels	was	with	him,	and	he	had	his	grandfather’s	handkerchief	neatly folded	in	his	breast	pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	the	two	boys	walked,	hitched,	and	rode	the	rails	until	they	got	to	Montana. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a>That’s	just	where	the	road	led	them.	In	Durbin,	a	small	town	dominated	by	a very	large	ranch,	they	saw	a	sign	in	the	local	feed	shop’s	window.	“Cowboys wanted.”	Beech	looked	at	Pink.	Pink	looked	at	Beech.	They	laughed.	They	had been	turned	down	for	so	many	jobs	that	the	idea	of	becoming	African-American cowboys	was	just	ridiculous.	All	he	and	Pink	knew	about	cowboys	they	had learned	from	the	movies:	ropin’	and	shootin’	and	gettin’	the	purty	girl	at	the	end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	there	they	stood	in	the	main	street	of	tiny	Durbin,	pretending	to	draw	on	each other	and	laughing,	when	a	large	white	man	said,	“What	are	you	boys	laughing at?”	Beech	looked	at	him.	He	was	wore	an	expensive	blue	suit,	solid	gold cufflinks,	a	ring	on	his	finger	with	a	green	jewel	the	size	of	a	small	potato	…	and a	cowboy	belt,	cowboy	hat,	and	cowboy	boots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing,	sir,”	said	Beech,	looking	down	at	the	ground	as	was	proper	at	that time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	something	obviously	is	entertaining	you	two	boys.	You	should	let	us	in	on the	joke.”	The	man	gestured	to	three	other	men,	smaller	than	him	and	not	as expensively	dressed,	who	stood	behind	him.	“So,	what	is	so	goldurned	funny?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	were	just	laughing	at	the	idea	of	us	applying	for	the	cowboy	job.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	what’s	so	funny	about	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	sir,	we’re	Negroes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	see	that.	You	don’t	know	much	about	cowboys,	do	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	what	you’ve	seen	in	the	movies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	fact	is	that	there	have	been	plenty	of	Negro	cowboys.	Isn’t	that	right, Sam?”	he	asked	the	man	closest	to	him.	Sam	looked	puzzled.	“Sam	doesn’t know	anything	either.	But	there	have	been.	Ain’t	nothing	funny	about	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a>“Do	you	boys	want	to	be	cowboys?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beech	and	Pink	looked	at	one	another,	not	knowing	what	the	right	answer	was supposed	to	be.	“We	want	to	work,”	said	Beech. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	you	are	the	two	luckiest	black	boys	this	side	of	the	Mississippi,”	he	said, although	he	used	a	much	worse	word	for	“black	boys.”	“I’m	C.	Carter Hargreaves,	the	owner	of	the	largest	ranch	in	Montana	and	the	richest	man	you’ll ever	meet,	and	I’m	going	to	hire	you.	I’ll	tell	you	why.	Out	here,	we	don’t	care what	the	color	of	your	skin	is.	What	matters	is	how	hard	you	want	to	work.	Sam, go	sign	these	boys	up	and	take	‘em	out	to	the	Slanted	Pine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	sir!”	they	both	said	more	than	once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	thank	me.	Theo	out	at	the	ranch	will	work	you	hard.	If	you	can’t	keep	up, then,	well,	we’ll	let	you	go	and	no	hard	feelings.”	He	turned	to	leave	but	then asked	one	more	question:	“You	boys	know	how	to	ride?	No?	Theo	will	teach you.”	He	laughed	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	Beech	and	Pink	did	work	hard.	For	two	years.	They	started	with	which	end of	the	cow	to	milk	and	moved	to	riding,	roping,	and	how	live	outside	for	weeks at	a	time.	Theo	was	a	good	teacher,	but	not	a	kind	one.	You	paid	for	your mistakes	in	aches	and	pains	at	best,	and	with	bruises	and	deductions	from	your pay	at	worst. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During	all	this	time,	they	saw	C.	Carter	Hargreaves	on	rare	occasion,	usually	at	a great	distance,	standing	on	the	porch	of	his	huge	house,	hands	on	his	hips, smoking	a	cigar.	Whenever	they	got	close	enough	to	him	to	be	noticed,	he’d	tip his	hat	at	them	in	acknowledgement,	and	once	he	asked	them	how	Theo	was treating	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over	time,	Pink	and	Beech	realized	that	despite	what	Mr.	Hargreaves	had	said, they	were	the	only	black	cowboys	working	at	the	Slanted	Pine.	They	became better	friends	than	ever,	relying	on	each	other	for	help	and encouragement….until	one	day,	the	two	of	them	were	walking	down	the	main street	on	their	day	off.	Out	of	the	bank	strode	Mr.	Hargreaves,	summery	in	a white	suit	and	a	straw	hat.	“Howdy,	boys,”	he	said,	and	then,	to	their	surprise turned	in	his	tracks	and	approached	them.	He	leaned	in	towards	Beech	and	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	I	have	a	word	with	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a>They	walked	across	the	street,	leaving	Pink	to	try	to	figure	out	what	they	were talking	about.	“I’ve	had	my	eye	on	you,”	said	Mr.	Hargreaves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beech	didn’t	know	if	this	was	a	good	thing	or	a	bad	thing.	“I’ve	been	impressed with	what	you’ve	learned.	I’d	like	you	to	be	Theo’s	second	trail	hand.”	This would	give	Beech	more	responsibility	and	just	a	little	more	pay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	that	would	be	fine,”	said	Beech.	“Thank	you,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	no,	you’ve	earned	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Becoming	second	trail	hand	meant	that	Beech	got	up	earlier	and	worked	later than	ever	before.	But	he	noticed	that	Pink	seemed	hurt.	“Come	ride	next	to	me,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beech	said	one	day,	waving	his	friend	forward.	As	they	rode	along	the	edge	of the	herd	of	cattle,	Pink	confessed	that	he	was	bothered	by	the	extra	25	cents	a week	Beech	was	getting.	“The	money	doesn’t	mean	anything,”	said	Beech.	And, after	talking	some	more,	it	turned	that	what	really	stung	Pink	was	what	the	raise meant:	Mr.	Hargreaves	favored	Beech.	“You	ride	better	than	I	do	and	you	rope	a whole	lot	better,”	Beech	told	his	friend.	“Who	knows	why	he	picked	me	instead of	you.	Just	luck.”	It	didn’t	take	long	for	these	true	friends	to	smooth	out	the kink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	two	weeks	later	Pink	had	a	chance	to	prove	that	he	was	the	better	cowboy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	night	Theo	had	produced	a	couple	of	bottles	of	whiskey	he’d	packed.	The little	group	of	cowboys	on	the	trail	proceeded	to	get	so	drunk	that	one	of	them fell	asleep	on	a	rattlesnake	which	was	so	surprised	that	it	slithered	away	without biting.	Beech	and	Pink	were	the	only	ones	left	sober	because	the	bottle	had	been passed	from	white	hand	to	white	hand.	Besides,	Beech	was	never	one	for drinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	stars	were	out	and	the	moon	was	below	the	horizon.	Beech	was	lying	on	his back	almost	asleep	when	a	gun	went	off	next	to	him.	He	and	Pink	bolted	upright, but	the	other	cowboys	had	barely	stirred.	They	saw	a	smoking	gun	in	the	hand	of Fred	Barker,	an	older	cowhand	who	had	fallen	asleep	holding	it,	and	fired	it	in his	sleep	without	even	waking	himself	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	the	cattle	had	noticed.	Four	hundred	cows	were	moving.	Beech	and	Pink tried	to	wake	Theo	but	he	just	rolled	over	in	the	middle	of	a	snore.	“No	time,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said	Beech,	jumping	into	the	saddle.	He	and	Pink	went	off	at	full	gallop	to prevent	the	cows	from	stampeding. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a>The	sound	of	400	cows	moving	together	isn’t	something	you	hear.	You	feel	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ground	becomes	a	trampoline,	pushing	up	against	you	and	suddenly dropping	beneath	you.	“They’re	headed	for	the	cliff!”	yelled	Beech,	spurring	his horse	with	Pink	close	behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cattle	are	stupid	but	not	stupid	enough	to	jump	off	a	cliff.	But	if	they	stampede alongside	of	one,	the	ones	on	the	edge	can	be	pushed	over	the	side	because	of the	sheer	rampaging	mass	of	flesh	that’s	moving	without	plan	or	sense.	Pink galloped	ahead	of	Beech,	putting	his	horse	between	the	cliff	and	the	cattle, herding	them	away	from	danger.	He	controlled	his	horse	with	a	precision	and confidence	that	awed	Beech.	And	the	cattle	were	turning	towards	safety. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	as	Beech	thought	they	were	over	the	worst	of	it,	he	saw	Pink’s	horse	go down.	A	panicked	cow	had	moved	the	wrong	way	and	the	horse	lost	its	footing along	the	side	of	the	cliff.	The	horse	started	to	right	itself,	but	Pink	was	nowhere to	be	seen.	Beech	pulled	ahead	and	jumped	off	his	horse.	Peering	over	the	side, sick	with	worry,	he	saw	his	friend	balanced	on	an	incline	too	steep	to	climb	and too	high	to	roll	down.	It	didn’t	take	any	fancy	rope	twirling	to	get	a	line	to	his friend,	and	Pink	quickly	clambered	up	to	safety.	Then	they	both	began	to	laugh, although	neither	could	tell	you	why.	And	then	they	brought	the	herd	of	cattle back	to	where	the	other	cowboys	were	still	sleeping,	all	except	for	Theo	who nodded	at	them	once,	pulled	the	brim	of	his	hat	over	his	eyes,	and	went	back	to sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	day,	as	they	were	riding	slowly	and	the	sun	was	down	low	enough	that the	air	had	already	begun	to	cool,	Beech	asked	Pink,	“Why	do	we	do	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ride	horses	next	to	cliffs	to	protect	cattle.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	it’s	our	job.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	didn’t	risk	our	lives	because	it’s	our	job.	Our	lives	aren’t	worth	a	couple	of lost	cattle.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	that’s	not	up	to	us	to	decide.	They’re	Mr.	Hargreaves’	cows.	We	owe	him for	hiring	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	right,	Pink.	He	hired	us	even	though	we’re	the	darkest	faced	cowboys</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a>we’ve	met	so	far.	That	counts	for	something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here’s	to	Mr.	Hargreaves,”	said	Pink,	toasting	him	with	his	canteen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three	weeks	later,	the	crew	came	back	to	town.	Beech	and	Pink	had	a	bath	at	the wash	house,	aired	out	their	bedding,	and	collected	their	pay.	They’d	been	back for	three	days	when	Beech	got	a	ride	into	town	to	get	his	saddle	fixed.	As	he	was coming	out	of	the	leather	repair	shop,	he	saw	Mr.	Hargreaves	walking	towards him.	Beech	took	off	his	hat	and	nodded	a	greeting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	want	to	speak	with	you,”	said	Mr.	Hargreaves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hear	you	and	your	friend	did	a	mighty	brave	thing	a	couple	of	weeks	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	just	did	what	we	were	hired	to	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	you	did	it	when	the	rest	of	the	crew	was	dead	drunk.	And,	I	understand that	you	did	it	at	the	risk	of	grave	personal	danger.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	just…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	don’t	downplay	it.	I	want	you	and	everyone	to	know	that	I	recognize	such bravery.	I	want	you	to	have	this	as	my	reward.”	He	put	a	bill	into	Beech’s	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	don’t	thank	me.	You	earned	it.”	He	shook	Beech’s	hand	and	walked	on.	“I have	one	of	those	for	your	friend	as	well.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	his	palm	was	a	$50	bill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	wasn’t	just	the	money	that	filled	Beech’s	heart	with	joy.	It	was	the	fact	that	he had	worked	hard	and	was	being	recognized	for	what	he	was	and	what	he’d	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	course,	getting	a	year’s	salary	all	at	once	wasn’t	nothing!	He	knew	what	a difference	the	extra	money	would	make	to	his	family	back	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beech	ran	straight	back	to	the	ranch	and	found	Pink	washing	the	lunch	dishes behind	the	cookhouse.	“Pink!	Pink!”	Beech	yelled.	“You	won’t	believe	what happened!”	And	Pink	didn’t	believe	him	until	Beech	showed	him	the	fifty	dollar bill.	“And	Mr.	Hargreaves	says	that	when	he	sees	you,	you’re	going	to	get	one, too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a>Pink	sat	down	on	the	ground,	amazed.	“That	Mr.	Hargreaves…”	he	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know,”	said	Beech.	“I’ve	met	a	lot	of	white	men,”	he	said,	as	if	he	weren’t	just nineteen	years	old.	“A	few	have	been	mean,	and	more	than	that	have	been	nice, but	to	almost	all	of	them	I	was	invisible.	Just	another	dark	face	like	a	thousand others	they	don’t	notice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	the	truth,”	said	Pink.	“The	only	time	I’m	noticed	by	a	white	person,	it’s either	because	I’m	in	the	way	or	they	expect	me	to	do	something	for	them.	And	I wouldn’t	even	mind	so	much	if	just	once	they’d	look	me	in	the	eyes,	and	maybe even	ask	me	my	name.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	Mr.	Hargreaves	is	the	exception,”	said	Beech. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fifty	dollars!”	Pink	exclaimed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	reckon	we	can	spend	some	on	ourselves?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	our	parents	would	insist	on	it.	What	are	you	thinking	of	doing	for yourself?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I	don’t	think	we	want	to	let	our	trail	partners	know	that	we’ve	come	into money.	They	might	resent	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	right.	I’m	not	sure	how	it’d	sit	with	them	if	they	found	out	that	the	two Negro	cowboys	had	been	so	well	rewarded.”	They	sat	on	the	ground	and	talked about	what	they	could	buy	that	wouldn’t	make	them	look	rich. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	day,	Beech	was	all	for	going	into	town	to	spend	a	little	of	their	money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	go,”	said	Pink.	“I’m	not	feeling	too	well.”	He	was	just	plain	worn	out	from the	weeks	on	the	trail.	So,	Beech	went	into	town	by	himself	for	the	second	day	in a	row. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	having	bought	a	checked	shirt	and	a	new	leather	strap	to	hold	his	sleeping roll	onto	his	saddle,	Beech	was	sitting	on	a	bench	at	the	edge	of	the	town	square. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	nothing	in	the	square	except	the	trash	that	had	blown	in	and	a	small aspen	tree	with	only	a	few	dozen	leaves	on	it	keeping	it	alive.	Beech	was	eating a	sandwich	he	had	brought	with	him	when	he	saw	Mr.	Hargreaves	approaching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	want	to	speak	with	you,”	said	Mr.	Hargreaves. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a>“Yes,	sir,”	said	Beech.	But	before	he	could	thank	Mr.	Hargreaves	for	his generosity,	he	was	cut	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hear	you	and	your	friend	did	a	mighty	brave	thing	a	couple	of	weeks	back,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said	Mr.	Hargreaves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well…”	Beech	began,	confused.	Hadn’t	they	had	this	conversation	already? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,	did	your	friend	tell	you	about	the	little	bonus	I	have	for	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	understand…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	if	he’s	really	your	buddy,	he	should	have	told	you.	Anyway,	I	understand that	you	acted	at	the	risk	of	grave	personal	danger.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	don’t	downplay	it.	I	want	you	and	everyone	to	know	that	I	recognize	such bravery.	I	want	you	to	have	this	as	my	reward.”	He	put	a	bill	into	Beech’s	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	don’t	thank	me.	You	earned	it.”	He	shook	Beech’s	hand	and	walked	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	tell	your	friend	to	make	sure	he	passes	messages	along	to	you.	It’s	not every	day	that	a	young	Negro	gets	a	$50	bill	pressed	into	his	palm.	”	Except	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hargreaves	used	a	term	much	worse	than	“Negro.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beech	stepped	back,	not	wanting	to	understand	what	had	happened.	Two	black faces	in	the	entire	town,	and	Mr.	Hargreaves	couldn’t	tell	them	apart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	you	even	say	Thank	you?”	demanded	Mr.	Hargreaves.	“Didn’t	your momma	teach	you	any	manners,	boy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beech	didn’t	know	what	to	say.	In	nervousness,	he	touched	the	clean,	white handkerchief	in	his	breast	pocket.	“Thank	you…”	he	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Hargreaves’	eyes	followed	Beech’s	hand	to	the	handkerchief.	Beech	could see	the	color	rise	in	Mr.	Hargreaves’	face	as	he	realized	his	blunder.	“You’re	the Negro	who	wears	a	handkerchief	in	his	pocket,”	he	said.	“I	gave	you	money yesterday.	Well,	son,	you	can	give	this	bill	to	your	friend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Hargreaves	started	to	turn	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a>“No,	sir,”	said	Beech. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse	me,	son?	What	did	you	say?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	said	no,	sir.	No	thank	you.	I	will	not	give	this	fifty	to	my	friend.	He	has	a name.	It’s	Bill	McDaniels.	His	friends	call	him	Pink.	I	will	give	him	the	fifty	you gave	me	yesterday,	but	I	don’t	want	this	one.	Here	it	is	back,	Mr.	Hargreaves,	sir, with	my	thanks.	But	you	don’t	even	know	who	you’re	thanking.	Me	and	my friend	Pink	have	worked	hard	for	you.	And,	we’re	no	heroes	but	we	did	save	a herd	of	your	cattle	by	steering	them	away	from	a	cliff.	Yes,	sir.	And	you	owe	us your	thanks.	But	you	can’t	thank	a	man	unless	you	know	who	is,	and	you	have had	two	years	to	learn	our	names.	So,	I	appreciate	the	money,	and	Lord	knows my	family	could	use	it,	but	I	can’t	rightly	take	it	from	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Hargreaves	looked	at	him	solemnly.	“What’s	your	name,	son?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	Thomas	Beecham	Sadler.	From	the	Chicago	Sadlers,	formerly	the	Georgia Sadlers,	a	slave	family.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	Thomas	Beecham	Sadler.	I’ve	learned	something	from	you.	So	I’m	going to	let	you	keep	that	fifty	dollars	because	that	was	a	fifty	dollar	lesson.”	Beech took	it	back	uncertainly.	Mr.	Hargreaves	continued:	“But	you’ve	also embarrassed	me,	son.	And	I	haven’t	become	who	I	am	by	being	embarrassed	by little	Negro	boys.	So,	take	your	money,	pack	your	goods,	and	get	off	my	ranch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’re	fired,	son.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beech	walked	back	to	the	ranch	slowly,	looking	at	the	dust	kicked	up	by	the	tips of	his	shoes.	He	felt	oddly	calm.	No	matter	how	hard	he	had	worked	and	how good	a	job	he	had	done,	he	was	still	only	skin	deep	to	Mr.	Hargreaves.	He	was	at best	“the	Negro	with	the	handkerchief.”	That’s	not	what	his	grandfather	had hoped	for	on	the	day	he	was	set	free. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	been	a	cowboy	long	enough,”	he	told	Pink.	“Want	to	come	with	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pink	stayed.	Beech	left	the	next	day	and	began	the	rest	of	his	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	barely	took	notes	while	he	was	talking.	But	I	remembered	it	all	and	began	to write	it	up	as	soon	as	I	had	asked	him	about	the	rest	of	his	life.	We	didn’t	have</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a>much	time	left,	and	I	wrote	quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	one	more	thing	to	do.	As	Ari	and	I	stood	up	to	head	back	to	where	Ms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Floyd	was	standing	in	the	main	hall,	Ari	created	a	distraction,	as	we	had	agreed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately,	Ari’s	idea	of	a	distraction	was	to	say,	“Oh,	look!”	in	an unconvincing	voice	and	point	into	the	main	hall.	When	Ari	again	said	“Oh, look!”	this	time	louder	and	more	obviously	faking	it,	and	when	again	neither	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sadler	nor	Mr.	Hallstadt	even	turned	their	heads,	I	just	walked	to	a	small	table behind	both	their	chairs	and	left	the	envelope.	They	would	have	had	to	have	had eyes	in	the	backs	of	their	heads	to	see	me.	I	had	printed	on	the	letter	“For	the People	of	Dunn	Village	Recreational	Center”	in	big	letters	that	no	one	could miss.	I	hoped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	the	little	party	the	residents	nibbled	on	oatmeal	cookies,	sipped	punch,	and talked	about	the	weather,	sports,	and	how	to	tan	a	zebra	hide.	(Mrs.	Wilcox	had apparently	spent	time	in	Africa.)	When	it	was	time	to	stand	up	and	tell	the	stories we	had	gathered,	I	could	hardly	wait.	But	I	had	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Halley	went	first.	She	told	about	the	time	that	Bill	Tidewater	met	John	F. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kennedy.	Kennedy	had	been	a	young	senator	from	Massachusetts	at	the	time	and Mr.	Tidewater	was	working	as	a	cab	driver	to	supplement	the	income	from	his job	as	a	landscape	gardener.	Senator	Kennedy	asked	Mr.	Tidewater	why	he	had to	work	so	hard,	and	when	he	replied	that	it	was	so	he	could	get	his	son	the medical	treatment	he	needed	to	learn	to	walk	after	coming	down	with	polio,	the Senator	promised	to	work	on	providing	health	care	for	working	people.	Maybe Mr.	Tidewater	changed	history	that	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	it	was	Ari’s	turn.	In	typical	fashion,	it	took	Ari	a	long	time	to	find	his	topic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First	he	talked	about	where	Mr.	Hallstadt	was	born	and	about	how	his	parents had	come	from	Germany	before	the	first	World	War.	Then	he	talked	about	a book	Ari	had	read	about	the	use	of	airplanes	in	that	war,	although	it	had	nothing to	do	with	Mr.	Hallstadt.	It	sounded	like	Ari	was	about	to	get	to	the	actual	story when	I	felt	a	tug	on	my	sleeve.	It	was	Mr.	Sadler	pulling	me	back	towards	a corner	of	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	up?”	I	asked,	thinking	perhaps	he	wanted	to	change	something	about the	story	he	had	told	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	response,	I	felt	an	envelope	being	pushed	into	my	hand.	I	didn’t	even	have	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>look	down	to	know	what	it	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Sadler	looked	at	me.	“I	didn’t	take	Mr.	Hargreaves’	fifty	dollars,	and	I	don’t have	to	take	your	$10,000.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	why?”	I	asked.	I	did	not	like	being	compared	to	Mr.	Hargreaves.	“It’s	for the	Center.	To	fix	it	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	at	me	hard.	“I	can’t	tell	you	where	I	got	it,”	I	said.	“I	just	can’t.	But it’s	mine.	Really.	I	got	it	honestly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why’d	you	bring	it?”	I	could	feel	Mr.	Sadler’s	eyes	inspecting	me	like	a	chef turning	a	potato	around	to	make	sure	that	there	were	no	blemishes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To	leave	it	here	where	someone	I	could	trust	would	find	it.	Why	won’t	you	take it?	I	really	want	the	center	to	have	it.	Your	story	meant	a	lot	to	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Sadler	took	the	envelope	back	from	my	hand	and	tucked	it	into	his	trouser pocket.	“Yes,	I	will	take	it.	Do	you	want	to	know	why?”	I	nodded.	I	was	so confused.	“You	came	with	a	big	packet	of	money,”	he	said.	“You	were	going	to help	us	even	before	you	met	us.	Even	before	you	knew	who	we	were.	Well, that’s	just	not	right.	It	makes	the	money	into	nothing	but	money.	If	you	want	it	to be	more	than	that,	then	you’d	better	get	to	know	us	first.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	could	money	be	anything	except	money?”	I	asked,	puzzled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	can	be	love.	Respect.	Guilt.	Contempt.	Even	hatred.	But	money	is	never	just money.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shook	my	hand	and	pushed	me	forward	gently	with	his	thin,	thin	hand.	Ms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Floyd	was	finishing	with	Amanda	who	apparently	had	just	given	her presentation.	As	I	approached,	I	was	surprised	to	hear	what	Ms.	Floyd	was saying:	“That	is	just	not	acceptable,	Amanda.	I	didn’t	say	anything	when	you took	advantage	of	your	friends	this	morning,	or	when	you	snuck	out	instead	of helping	here.	But	that	is	just	plain	rude	to	our	hosts,	and	I	will	not	stand	for	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	go	back	to	Mrs.	Cromley,	apologize,	and	actually	talk	with	her.	And	Lydia, if	the	story	you	have	to	tell	exhibits	the	same	sort	of	disrespect,	then	you’d	better go	back	right	now	to	Mr.	Alma	and	do	a	better	job.”	Turning	to	the	audience, Ms.	Floyd	pulled	herself	together.	“I	do	apologize.	Those	are	not	students	typical of	Oakes	Middle	School.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a>“Don’t	apologize,	dear,”	said	Ms.	Markson.	“We	quite	enjoyed	it.	In	fact,	you were	too	gentle	on	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,”	said	Ms.	Floyd,	consulting	her	list,	“Jake	Richter	will	tell	you	a	story from	the	life	of	Thomas	Sadler.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stood.	“They	called	him	‘Beech,’”	I	began,	“and	he	is	the	grandchild	of	slaves.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	saw	Mr.	Sadler	touch	the	handkerchief	in	his	pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	14</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Whenever	we	went	into	the	city	by	ourselves,	my	parents	gave	me	the	same lecture:	Call	if	we	need	help,	don’t	go	anywhere	with	strangers,	be	careful	of	the crazy	drivers.	This	time,	just	as	I	was	leaving,	my	father	put	a	ten	dollar	bill	in my	hand.	“Put	that	in	a	safe	place,	just	in	case	of	emergencies.”	I	thanked	him, shoved	it	into	my	pocket,	and	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	not	like	the	city	is	that	big	a	place	to	begin	with.	But	compared	to	the	other towns	in	the	area,	it	definitely	deserved	the	title	“city.”	It	had	its	own	trolley system,	homeless	people	on	the	street,	and	a	section	called	“The	Red	Zone” </p>
<p class="calibre1">where	kids	our	age	get	really	uncomfortable	with	what’s	on	the	movie	marquees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	agreed	to	pick	up	Mimi	on	my	way	to	the	train	station	even	though	it	was in	the	wrong	direction	because	I	had	a	special	mission.	As	I	stood	outside	my house,	I	checked	the	contents	of	the	envelope	again.	It	was	a	plain	brown envelope.	I’d	wrapped	the	bills	inside	with	some	of	the	special	pink	yarn	my mother	was	using	to	knit	a	cap	for	Maddie.	It	had	flecks	of	green	and	purple	in it,	and	little	sparkly	bits,	too,	but	it’s	what	was	handy.	I	licked	the	flap	and	made sure	it	was	sealed,	and	carefully	zipped	the	envelope	inside	my	coat.	I	didn’t want	$20,000	in	thousand	dollar	bills	falling	out	into	the	street	as	I	biked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	approached	Mimi’s	house	carefully,	and	snuck	up	to	her	mailbox,	checking	to see	if	anyone	was	looking.	I	put	the	envelope	in	and	closed	the	lid	trying	not	to make	a	sound.	Then	I	knocked	on	Mimi’s	door,	probably	louder	than	usual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimi	came	out	dressed	in	a	green	t-shirt,	darker	green	shorts,	green	sneakers, and	pink	socks.	You	couldn’t	get	much	spring-ier	than	that.	“Hi,”	she	said	as	she stepped	past	me	on	the	stoop	in	front	of	her	door.	Then,	as	if	remembering something	she’d	forgotten,	she	turned	back	and	flipped	up	the	lid	of	the	mailbox. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	took	out	the	envelope,	looked	at	it,	said,	“Odd.	No	stamp,”	opened	her	front door,	and	put	it	on	the	mail	table.	We	headed	off	to	the	station.	I	was	relieved.	I didn’t	want	to	tell	Mimi	about	the	gift	until	after	her	parents	got	it	just	in	case she	didn’t	like	the	idea.	But	I	also	didn’t	want	her	to	hear	about	it	from	her parents	instead	of	from	me.	Some	time	today	I	figured	I’d	have	a	chance	to	tell her	without	Ari	being	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	was	not	to	be	that	time.	Ari	came	scooting	up	on	his	bike,	lightly	crashed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a>into	Mimi’s	porch	rail,	and	turned	around	so	that	together	we	could	ride	the	six blocks	to	the	train	station. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">We	talked	for	the	entire	35	minute	trip,	except	for	ten	minutes	when	we	went	to the	refreshment	car	where	we	ate	terrible	muffins.	Mainly	we	talked	about	how we	were	going	to	spend	money	in	the	city.	That	was	our	mission.	Away	from	our parents	and	other	friends,	we	could	at	last	just	be	plain	old	rich	kids. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	city	is	the	last	stop	the	train	makes,	which	is	one	reason	our	parents	let	us take	it:	it’s	hard	to	get	off	at	the	wrong	place.	We	emerged	into	the	fresh	air	like people	waking	up.	The	day	had	a	little	bite	of	cold	to	it,	making	the	city	seem even	more	filled	with	straight	lines	and	corners	than	usual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	to	first?”	I	asked,	patting	my	front	pockets,	each	of	which	held	a ridiculous	amount	of	money.	I’d	split	the	cash	up,	figuring	I	wouldn’t	get pickpocketed	in	both	pockets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Planetarium!”	said	Ari	without	hesitation.	Mimi	and	I	looked	at	each	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why	not? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	this	way,”	said	Mimi,	heading	up	the	street.	She	was	by	far	the	best	oriented of	the	three	of	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Walking?”	I	said	in	mock	shock.	“Never!”	I	stepped	to	the	curb	and	waved	my hand.	A	taxi	pulled	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now,	there	are	some	things	about	being	a	kid	with	money	that	you’re	not	ready for.	I	was	expecting	the	cab	driver	to	look	at	us	as	if	we	were	spoiled	brats.	And since	we	were	in	the	city	in	order	to	act	like	spoiled	brats,	we	deserved	that	look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	all,	the	driver	was	working	hard	all	day	in	order	to	make	the	sort	of	money that	we	were	just	throwing	around.	But	what	I	wasn’t	ready	for	was	tipping.	I knew	that	you	usually	tip	15%	of	the	cost	of	the	ride.	And	I	could	do	the	math. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	problem	is	that	it’s	just	plain	embarrassing	to	give	someone	a	tip.	It’s	not	so bad	when	you	can	leave	it	on	a	table	and	flee,	but	when	you	have	to	actually hand	it	to	someone,	they	get	to	see	if	you’re	a	big	tipper	or	a	little	tipper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	I	sat	during	the	entire	drive	worrying	about	the	moment	of	truth.	As	we	got close	to	the	planetarium,	it	was	clear	that	the	ride	was	going	to	cost	about	$6.00. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>Fifteen	percent	is	ten	percent	plus	half	of	ten	percent.	That’s	90	cents.	Round	it up	to	a	dollar.	Total	cost	of	ride,	including	tip:	$7.00.	Easy.	But	the	smallest	bill	I had	was	a	ten.	So,	I’d	give	him	the	ten	and	ask	for	three	back.	But	what’s	$3	to the	world’s	richest	boy?	I	should	just	say,	“Keep	the	change,”	except	then	I would	really	seem	like	a	spoiled	rich	kid.	But	the	driver	wouldn’t	care:	I	may	be spoiled,	but	I	tip	well.	Those	three	dollars	might	mean	something	to	the	driver. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	other	hand,	I	could	give	him	a	twenty	dollar	bill	and	tell	him	to	keep	the change	and	it	wouldn’t	make	the	slightest	bit	of	difference	to	me.	But	he’d	look at	the	twenty	and	ask	me	if	I	meant	to	give	him	a	ten.	“No,	no,	keep	the	change, my	good	man,”	I’d	say.	No,	giving	him	a	twenty	would	draw	out	the	entire interchange.	I	could	give	him	the	twenty	and	then	run	away,	but	suppose	he started	chasing	me,	waving	the	$20	bill	and	yelling	“Hey,	Spoiled	Rich	Kid,	you gave	me	too	much	money!”	So	much	to	think	about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	I	sat	there,	chewing	my	lip,	dreading	the	moment	when	I’d	have	to	pay.	My anxiety	was	clearly	bothering	Mimi	and	Ari	also. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cab	pulled	to	the	curb.	“Six	dollars	even,”	said	the	taxi	driver. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	did	a	very	nice	job,”	I	said,	handing	him	a	twenty	dollar	bill.	“Keep	the change.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	at	it	carefully,	nodded	once	and	drove	off	without	saying	a	word	and without	looking	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	planetarium	was	fun.	It	always	is.	Even	if	you	don’t	care	about	the	universe</p>
<p class="calibre1">-	although,	if	you	don’t	care	about	the	universe,	what’s	left	to	care	about?	-	it’s just	such	a	cool	place.	It’s	darker	than	dark,	and	then	the	stars	come	out,	and	a big	voice	comes	over	the	loudspeakers	from	all	directions	at	once.	Plus,	they always	have	some	show	biz	touch.	This	time	it	was	a	race	through	the	solar system	faster	than	the	speed	of	light,	taking	a	left	around	Jupiter	and	a	couple	of spins	around	Neptune. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	went	to	the	museum’s	gift	store	but	didn’t	want	to	get	anything	too	expensive that	we	couldn’t	explain	to	our	parents,	so	I	got	a	selection	of	little	things:	some polished	gems,	a	light-up	pen,	and	a	foam	“moon	rock.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next	it	was	on	to	the	Mystery	Arcade,	the	largest	electronic	game	place	in	the city.	The	three	of	us	had	put	in	plenty	of	hours	at	the	Quarter	Time	arcade	in	our town.	Quarter	Time	was	a	single	room	in	the	mall	with	machines	lining	its	walls. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>At	the	Mystery	Arcade,	you	left	the	electronic	fighting	machine	room	and	you entered	the	electronic	fake	sports	room,	which	was	to	the	right	of	the	electronic pinball	room.	And	that	was	just	on	the	first	floor.	The	three	of	us	stood	in	awe, frozen	in	the	entry	way.	Then	I	headed	for	the	change	machine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Do	you	know	how	much	$50	in	quarters	weighs?	More	than	you	think.	But	after I	divided	it	into	threes	(Ari	and	Mimi	each	got	an	extra),	they	didn’t	feel	heavy, just	comforting.	We	played	and	played,	sometimes	together,	sometimes	apart, until	our	brains	were	booping	with	electronic	beeps	and	our	fingers	were	flicking without	our	even	wanting	them	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	after	we’d	sat	on	the	bench	outside	for	ten	minutes,	we	could	still	feel	the ringing	in	our	brains.	“Where	to?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimi	looked	hesitant.	“What	is	it?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	sort	of	read	about	an	exhibit	at	the	Museum	of	Art	that	sounded	sort	of	cool. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Would	you	be	sort	of	interested	in	going?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sort	of,”	I	replied.	“What	is	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	it’s	this	woman	who	takes	pictures	of	everyday	things	really	close	up	so you	can	see	their	textures.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whatever!”	Ari	said	enthusiastically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Taxi!”	I	called. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Why	do	museums	have	such	large	doors?	What	sort	of	giants	do	they	think	are going	to	be	visiting? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	stepping	through	them,	we	wanted	to	have	a	snack.	Rather	than	waiting in	a	restaurant,	we	decided	to	eat	from	the	food	carts	in	front	of	the	museum: roasted	chestnuts,	hot	sugared	cashews,	a	Super	Sluggo	ice	cream	bar	and	sodas all	around.	It	was	more	than	we	could	eat.	In	fact,	it	was	more	than	we	could hold.	We	sat	on	a	bench,	leaning	forward	to	avoid	the	dripping	ice	cream,	and	ate until	we	were	full.	Then	we	closed	up	the	bags	of	cashews	and	carefully	placed the	rest	of	our	uneaten	treats	into	a	waste	basket	where	a	squirrel	was	happily</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>feasting	regardless	of	the	large	mammals	next	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	line	into	the	museum	was	short,	and	we	had	barely	wiped	our	hands	on	the napkins	when	it	was	our	turn.	Immediately	I	was	facing	another	crisis,	for	the sign	at	the	booth	said</p>
<p class="calibre1">Admission</p>
<p class="calibre1">Donate	whatever	you	want</p>
<p class="calibre1">Suggestion:	$7.00	for	adults	and	$2	for	children	under	12</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow,	it’s	free!”	said	Ari. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	so	unfair,”	said	Mimi	at	the	same	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	unfair?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	you	have	to	decide	whether	you’re	going	to	be	a	cheapskate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	why	they	have	the	suggestion,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	it’s	just	a	suggestion.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	what	they	expect	you	to	pay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	it’s	not.	That’s	why	they	call	it	a	suggestion.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	to	the	woman	in	the	booth.	“Excuse	me,	but	do	most	people	pay	the $7?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had	been	listening	to	our	discussion	and	smiled.	“About	half	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	does	the	other	half	go	in	for	free?”	asked	Ari,	a	little	too	eagerly? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some	do.	Some	people	put	in	more.	Some	put	in	a	few	dollars,	depending	on what	they	can	afford.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,”	I	said	and	stepped	out	of	the	line	so	that	other	people,	less confused	than	we	were,	could	enter.	The	three	of	us	stood	next	to	a	giant	statue of	a	man,	a	woman	and	a	child	made	entirely	out	of	nails. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a>“So,	let’s	pay	our	money	and	go	in,”	Mimi	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	heard	her,”	I	said.	“Some	people	pay	less	depending	on	what	they	can afford,	and	some	people	pay	more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So?”	asked	Ari. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	know	what	I	could	afford?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	pay	$10	each	and	let’s	go	in,”	said	Ari. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	$10?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	it’s	more	and	it’s	not	$11.37.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	wrong	with	$11.37?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	round.	No	one	gives	un-round	numbers,	unless	they’re	putting	in	all their	change.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	why	not	$20?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ok,	$20,”	Ari	said.	“Let’s	go	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head.	“I	don’t	know	how	to	figure	this	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimi	put	her	hand	on	my	shoulder	and	said,	“There’s	nothing	to	figure.	There are	no	rules.	You’re	the	world’s	richest	boy.	You’re	an	exception	to	the	rules about	money.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	what	do	I	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Put	in	a	thousand	dollars.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?!”	Ari	said,	in	shock.	“A	thousand	dollars?	Why?!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	he	can	without	even	noticing	it.	You	brought	that	much,	didn’t	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Plenty	more	than	that,”	I	said,	feeling	both	front	pockets	to	reassure	myself	that the	money	was	still	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a>“So,	a	thousand	dollars	is	nice	round	number.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	why	not	two	thousand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because,	well,	that’s	too	much,”	Mimi	said	with	such	decisiveness	that	ended the	conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	away	so	I	could	pull	out	a	thousand	dollar	bill	without	attracting attention,	folded	the	bill	up	so	you	couldn’t	see	how	much	it	was	for,	and	strolled casually	back	to	the	booth.	As	if	I	were	just	dropping	in	a	couple	of	bucks,	I dropped	it	into	the	slot	and	walked	in.	Mimi	and	Ari	each	put	in	a	$10	bill	I’d given	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	one	noticed.	When	they	counted	the	money	up	that	evening,	I	imagined someone	saying,	“Hey,	Myrtle,	that’s	one	generous	person!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	course,	I’d	never	know.	And	I’d	never	be	thanked.	That	shouldn’t	have mattered	to	me,	but,	strangely,	it	did.	A	little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	stepped	out	into	the	light	with	a	half	day	left.	The	museum	had	been	a museum:	walls	and	walls	of	stuff	I	didn’t	care	about	with	occasional	items	that carried	me	like	a	crumb	being	washed	down	a	drain.	The	rooms	with	the	photo exhibit	were	good.	Because	the	photographer	had	taken	pictures	of	things	in extreme	close-up,	you	had	to	stand	back	from	the	wall	to	see	what	they	were,	but as	you	got	closer	and	closer,	the	textures	of	the	thing	became	more	interesting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	like	everyone	else	there,	we	walked	backwards	and	forwards	in	front	of	each photo	as	if	we	were	on	a	rubber	band. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	we	got	outside,	we	realized	we	were	hungry	again.	That	junk	food	feast hadn’t	filled	us	up	for	long.	I	opened	up	the	tourist	information	I’d	gotten	from the	Web.	“Grande	Fleur,”	I	said,	pointing	at	the	entry.	“That’s	where	we’re	going to	have	lunch.	Taxi!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	tourist	guide	said	that	the	Grande	Fleur	was	the	finest	restaurant	in	town, featuring	French	menu	items	that	I	couldn’t	have	pronounced	even	if	I’d	had	my jaw	hinges	oiled.	The	service	was	reported	to	be	perfect,	with	waiters	in	white gloves	attending	to	your	every	need.	The	décor	-	the	insides	-	was	described	as opulent	and	elegant,	which	I	figured	meant	that	they	didn’t	have	photos	of	the owner’s	nieces	and	nephews	on	the	wall.	But	it	didn’t	matter	because	the	Grande Fleur	was	full.	No	amount	of	money	was	going	to	empty	the	place	any	sooner. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a>“You	want	to	wait	or	find	somewhere	else?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	getting	hungry,”	said	Ari. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	we	looked	in	the	guide	again.	The	Salzburg	Grille	was	ranked	almost	as	high as	the	Grande	Fleur	and	it	was	only	a	couple	of	blocks	away.	It	was	a	beautiful day	and	spending	money	on	a	cab	to	go	two	blocks	didn’t	even	feel	like	fun,	so we	walked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	it	is,”	I	said.	The	Salzburg	Grille	has	a	dark	blue	awning	with	its	name written	in	gold	script.	Two	doors	before	it	was	a	jewelry	store	that	had	gone	out of	business.	The	lights	were	off	and	the	store	was	empty.	Sitting	on	a	blanket	in its	doorway	were	a	homeless	woman	and	a	man	and	a	little	dog.	A	sign	written on	a	crinkled	flap	from	a	cardboard	box	said	“Homeless	and	hungry.	Give	a hand?”	Probably	because	we	were	kids,	they	didn’t	look	at	us	as	we	approached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	look	at	the	dog,”	said	Mimi,	giving	me	a	wide-eyed	tender	gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	I	said,	panicked,	in	a	soft	voice.	I	didn’t	want	to	be	forced	into	a decision	right	away.	“Stay	away,”	I	said,	“and	we’ll	talk	about	it	at	lunch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please,”	I	said	urgently.	“I	don’t	want	to	talk	about	it	in	front	of	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	waved	and	passed	by.	“Cute	dog,”	Mimi	said	to	them.	They	smiled	back	at her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	restaurant	was	beautiful,	all	brick	and	brass	and	plants.	The	waiter	who seated	us	only	looked	at	us	funny	for	a	moment,	and	then	must	have	figured	that our	parents	had	sent	us	here	with	money.	His	hair	was	slicked	back,	he	wore	a white	shirt	that	was	so	clean	and	white	it	would	probably	have	stayed	lit	even	if the	lights	went	out,	and	he	walked	so	straight	you	could	tear	paper	along	his edge.	“Right	this	way,”	he	said,	leading	us	to	a	table	near	the	window	looking out	on	the	homeless	couple. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	feel	good	about	this,”	said	Mimi.	“Those	people	are	hungry	and	here	we are…”	We	looked	at	the	menus	silently.	Even	the	appetizers	cost	more	than	ten dollars.	I	did	the	math	and	figured	we’d	be	spending	about	$150	here.	Although that	wasn’t	even	a	drop	in	my	bucket,	it	was	still	a	lot	of	money	to	spend	on	a lunch	for	three. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a>“Ok,	Mimi,	I	don’t	feel	good	about	it	either.	But	whatever	we	do,	it	doesn’t	have to	affect	our	lunch.	It’s	not	like	I	have	$150	that	I	can	spend	either	on	lunch	or	on them.	So,	let’s	order	a	nice	lunch.	I’m	really	hungry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me,	too,”	said	Ari,	putting	half	a	roll	into	his	mouth	all	at	once,	and,	worse, leaving	the	other	half	sticking	out	from	his	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	waiter	who	had	seated	us	came	over	and	said	that	it	was	going	to	be	his pleasure	to	serve	us	this	afternoon.	(Yeah,	I	thought,	if	it’s	such	a	pleasure,	why do	they	have	to	pay	him	to	do	it?)	It	turns	out	that	the	Salzburg	Grille	is	a	grill, and	grills	feature	meat,	making	it	tough	to	order	an	all-vegetarian	meal.	But	we managed:	French	fries,	salads,	grilled	cheese,	fried	mozzarella	sticks,	onion rings,	a	portabella	mushroom	sandwich,	ginger	broccoli	stir	fry,	garlic	bread, stuffed	potatoes	and	brownie	sundaes	for	dessert. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	waited	for	the	food	to	arrive,	Mimi	tapped	out	a	rhythm	with	a	breadstick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	what	are	we	going	to	do	for	those	nice	people?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	do	you	know	they’re	nice?”	asked	Ari. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	they	smiled	when	I	complimented	their	doggie.	Besides,	the	doggie looks	happy	and	friendly,	so	they	must	take	good	care	of	it,	which	can’t	be	easy when	you’re	homeless	and	begging	on	the	streets.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	didn’t	look	that	happy	to	me,”	Ari	protested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	tell,”	said	Mimi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 <i class="calibre3">think</i>	you	can	tell.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	doesn’t	matter	if	the	dog	is	nice,”	I	interrupted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	going	to	give	them	money	anyway?”	asked	Ari. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	Maybe.	I	don’t	know	yet.”	I	was	thinking	about	what	“Beech”	Sadler	had told	me:	I	should	know	who	they	are	instead	of	just	dropping	money	in	their	lap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	waiter	brought	our	food,	I	ordered	three	hamburgers	to	go,	except	they of	course	don’t	call	them	“hamburgers”	in	a	place	like	the	Salzburg	Grille.	No, they	were	“ground	porterhouse,”	and	you	had	to	ask	to	get	ketchup. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>“We	don’t	generally	prepare	take-out	meals,”	the	waiter	said.	“I’m	so	sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	he	wasn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	was	about	to	turn	away,	I	said,	“Ok.	Do	you	do	doggy	bags	if	we	can’t finish	our	lunch?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	certainly,	sir,	we	can	packaged	your	uneaten	portion	for	home consumption.”	He	didn’t	look	happy	that	I	had	called	them	doggy	bags. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	that	case,	I’d	like	three	hamburgers	to	eat	now	because	I’m	really	really hungry.	And	if	I	can’t	finish	them,	I’ll	ask	you	to	pack	them	up	for	me	in	a doggy	bag.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	don’t	I	just	put	them	in	a	carry-away	carton	for	you	and	have	it	ready	for you	when	you’re	done	with	your	meal?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	idea!	Thank	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	when	we	were	done,	there	was	our	waiter	with	the	bill.	Only	after	I	had	paid in	full	did	he	hand	over	the	bag	with	the	three	hamburger	lunches	in	it.	“Thank you,”	I	said,	leaving	a	$100	tip.	No,	I	didn’t	like	him	very	much,	but	he	was working	hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	still	wasn’t	sure	how	much	I	was	going	to	give	the	homeless	couple	when	Mimi began	petting	their	dog.	The	dog	got	all	excited	the	way	little	dogs	do,	skittering about	on	his	little	dog	feet	as	if	the	sidewalk	were	just	too	hot	to	stand	still	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	his	name?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Spunky,”	said	the	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Short	for	Spunkalator,”	explained	the	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	adorable,”	Mimi	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	a	good	dog,”	confirmed	the	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimi	looked	at	me	and	said	to	the	couple,	“We	were	wondering	if	you	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a>Spunky	would	like	some	hamburgers	from	that	restaurant.”	I	stepped	forward with	the	bag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“From	the	Grille?	Sure!	I’ve	always	wondered	what	their	food	is	like.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	handed	the	bag	to	him	and	he	carefully	laid	out	its	contents:	fat	hamburgers	on hard	rolls,	a	container	of	ketchup,	a	large	bag	of	French	fries	(or,	as	the	Grille called	them,	“Crisp	Juliennes	of	New	Potatoes”),	thick	paper	napkins	and	three heavy-weight	plastic	forks	as	if	anyone	would	use	forks	to	eat	French	fries	and hamburgers.	He	pulled	at	one	meat	patty	until	a	large	chunk	came	off	and	gave	it to	Spunky.	It	was	gone	in	two	shakes	of	a	small	dog’s	tail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	he	likes	that,”	said	the	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	a	very	nice	thing	you’ve	done,”	said	the	man.	“This	is	our	regular	spot, but	I’ve	never	had	food	from	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	good,”	said	Ari. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	took	a	bite.	“Hmm,	yes	it	is.	It’s	very	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	want	some?”	the	woman	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	no,”	Mimi	said.	“We	just	ate.	Thanks	though.”	Also,	she	was	a	vegetarian. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,”	said	Ari	as	the	three	of	them	ate	their	hamburgers,	“How’d	you	end	up here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	good	to	have	Ari	with	you	if	you	want	something	blurted	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	that	you’re	‘ending	up’	here,”	said	Mimi,	awkwardly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	no,”	said	the	man.	“That’s	a	fair	question.	And	the	answer	is	pretty	simple.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	schizophrenic,”	said	the	woman.	“My	name	is	Caroline.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	Philip,”	said	the	man,	and	we	introduced	ourselves	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	said	Philip,	“Caroline	is	schizophrenic.	Do	you	know	what	that	means?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	thinks	she’s	different	people,”	Ari	said	with	all	the	confidence	that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a>ignorance	can	give	a	person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	that’s	what	it	means	in	the	movies.	But	in	real	life,	a	schizophrenic	is,	well, a	crazy	person.	Caroline	sometimes	hears	voices	that	aren’t	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	in	a	while.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	in	a	couple	of	days,”	Philip	said.	“And	when	she	hears	voices,	she	talks back	to	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	I’m	nuts,”	Caroline	said.	“It	scares	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can’t	they	do	anything	about	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	much,”	said	Caroline.	“You	know	the	Carlton	Center?	I	was	there	for	a couple	of	years.	And	then	the	state	stopped	paying	so	they	kicked	me	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	just	put	you	on	the	street?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	tried	to	help.	I	was	supposed	to	come	in	every	week	or	every	two	weeks or	something,	but	I	kept	getting	confused.	Never	made	it	back.	But	then	I	met Philip	and	Spunky.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	living	on	the	street,”	Philip	said.	“And	it’s	easy	to	tell	you	how	I	got there:	drugs.	I	was	a	heroin	addict.	I	probably	still	am.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	you	know?”	asked	Ari. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	using	now,	but	I	may	be	tomorrow.	That’s	the	sad	truth.	Can’t	get	a	job and	couldn’t	keep	one	if	I	did.	I’ve	tried	and	I	always	end	up	back	using.	It’s	a bad	thing,	but	I	guess	they	teach	you	that	in	school.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	we	did	a	whole	unit	on	it	in	Health,”	Ari	said	a	tad	too	cheerfully.	I looked	harshly	at	him	to	keep	him	from	describing	the	report	he’d	done.	It	had been	in	the	form	of	a	humorous	skit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	now	you	both	live	on	the	street	and	live	on	what	people	give	you?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sometimes	we	save	enough	money	to	get	ourselves	a	little	treat,”	said	Caroline. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mainly	we	just	drink	up	the	extra	money,	to	tell	you	the	truth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a>“That’s	not	true,	Philly.	We	got	this	sweater	for	me	with	money	we	saved.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	was	over	a	year	ago,”	Philip	said	gently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,”	I	asked,	“What	would	you	do	if	you	won	the	lottery?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	much?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Say	$10,000.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	that’d	be	too	much	to	drink,”	said	Philip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	stay	in	a	hotel	and	get	room	service,”	said	Caroline. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	invite	our	friends.	Have	a	party.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fun!”	said	Caroline. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or,	we	could	try	to	get	off	the	streets,”	Philip	said,	rubbing	his	chin.	He	pulled Spunky	into	his	lap	and	stroked	his	head	and	back.	“That’d	be	the	smart	thing	to do.	Of	course,	I	didn’t	get	here	by	doing	smart	things.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	don’t	say	that,”	said	Caroline. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hard	to	say	anything	else,”	Philip	replied.	“So,	what	would	get	me	off	the street?	I	could	get	myself	cleaned	up	with	that	type	of	money.	Some	new	clothes so	I	wouldn’t	look	like	a	bum.	We	could	rent	a	little	place.	Maybe	I	could	get	a job	if	I	didn’t	look	homeless.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	lot	of	it	is	the	clothing,”	Caroline	confided. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	could	get	a	cell	phone	so	I	could	apply	for	a	job	and	give	them	a	way	to	reach me.	But	I	haven’t	been	good	at	holding	jobs,”	he	continued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	Mimi.	She	nodded.	“Ok,	this	is	going	to	be	hard	to	believe,”	I	began, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“but	I	want	you	to	have	this.”	I	pulled	an	envelope	out	of	each	of	my	front pockets.	“That’s	$10,000.”	I	held	it	out	to	them.	They	didn’t	move.	“It’s	for	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	can’t	tell	anyone	where	you	got	it,	but	it’s	totally	legal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	won	the	lottery.	The	big	one,”	said	Ari.	“Really.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>“Really	I	did.	I	won	more	money	than	anyone	could	spend	in	a	lifetime.	So, please	take	this.	But	I	hope	you	don’t	spend	it	on	a	hotel	room	or…”	I	didn’t want	to	say	“heroin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Caroline	took	one	envelope	from	my	hand.	Philip	looked	at	her	and	then	took	the other	envelope.	They	looked	in	them	as	if	they	were	peering	through	a	telescope at	another	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	what	to	say,”	said	Philip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	really	awkward	for	all	of	us,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	for	me,”	said	Caroline.	“Thank	you.	Thank	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,”	said	Philip.	“We’ll	try	to	do	something	with	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Spunky	thanks	you,”	said	Caroline,	waving	the	dog’s	tiny	paw	at	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ok.	You’re	welcome.	And	remember,	you	can’t	tell	anyone	where	you	got	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Won’t	tell	a	soul.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	were	backing	away	when	someone	approached	the	blanket	they	were	sitting on	and	dropped	a	bill	into	the	couple’s	cup.	“Thanks,	Martin,”	said	Caroline. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ooh,”	she	said.	“It’s	a	twenty!	He	must	have	had	a	good	day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	a	regular.	Everyday	he	drops	in	a	buck	or	two,”	explained	Philip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Martin	continued	down	the	street,	we	saw	that	he	had	been	our	waiter	at lunch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I	feel	really	weird	about	that,”	I	said	when	we	were	a	block	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About	what?”	Ari	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About	giving	them	the	money.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	what	you	mean,”	said	Mimi.	“It’s	just	so	weird	that	you	have	so	much and	they	have	nothing.	And	you	get	to	decide.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a>“Yeah.	I	could	have	given	them	$5,000	or	$15,000.	No	difference	to	me.	A	huge difference	to	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or	you	could	have	given	them	$12,000,”	chimed	in	Ari. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh	huh.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or	$16,300,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ok,	Ari,	we	got	the	point.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wanted	Ari	to	stop	before	he	said,	“Or	$20,000.”	That’s	what	I	gave	Mimi’s family.	My	stomach	knotted	as	I	thought	about	how	Mimi	would	react	when	she found	out	that	I’d	given	her	parents	money	as	if	they	were	a	couple	living	on	the street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	walked	down	the	street,	not	in	the	mood	for	a	taxi,	until	we	got	to	the Barrymore	Theatre	in	the	center	of	the	city.	I	chatted	about	everything	I	could think	of	in	order	to	keep	the	topic	off	of	charity	and	money.	When	we	got	to	the theatre,	I	ordered	three	of	the	best	seats	for	the	matinee	performance	of	“Magic and	All	That,”	a	show	that	combined	magic	and	comedy.	With	Ari	between	me and	Mimi,	I	felt	safer,	but	even	so	I	read	the	program	guide	studiously	until	the lights	went	down	to	avoid	talking	with	her.	I	just	felt	awkward.	And	I	hoped	the feeling	would	go	away	soon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	intermission,	Ari	went	to	get	candy.	The	seat	was	getting	uncomfortable,	so	I stood.	“Mimi,”	I	said,	“there’s	something	I	have	to	tell	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	up,	waiting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	that	envelope	in	your	mailbox	this	morning?	The	one	without	any stamps?”	She	nodded.	“That	was	from	me.	I	gave	your	parents	some	money	to help	them	out.	But	you	can’t	tell	them	it	was	from	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	much?”	she	asked.	Her	voice	was	neutral,	like	she	was	asking	how	much	a candy	bar	cost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	know	how	much	would	be	right,	so	I	gave	them	$20,000.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	say	anything, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a>“So,”	I	asked,	“what	do	you	think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	want	me	to	think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing,”	I	replied,	confused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ok,	I	think	nothing.	You	did	it.	It’s	done.	I	won’t	give	away	your	secret.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari	came	back	with	six	candy	bars.	“I	didn’t	know	what	you’d	want,	so	I	got	one of	each.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	show	was	good	but	not	great:	many	of	the	tricks	were	familiar	-	he	actually sawed	a	lady	in	half	-	and	the	comedy	sketches	were	sort	of	dumb.	Nevertheless, as	we	left	I	found	myself	saying	“That	was	great!	Fantastic!”	because	I	had discovered,	in	the	program	guide,	the	right	way	to	give	away	money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimi	didn’t	speak	to	either	of	us	during	the	entire	ride	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	must	be	tired,”	Ari	said	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	reply. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	15</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">The	Fordgythe	Foundation</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Helping	with	a	Helping	Hand</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">PO	Box	1274</p>
<p class="calibre1">Melville</p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	what	it	said	on	the	stationery	I	had	ordered	over	the	Internet.	I	picked	up the	carton	at	my	new	post	office	box	and	didn’t	open	it	until	I	was	back	in	my bedroom.	The	cream	colored	pages	were	heavy,	and	you	could	read	the	raised lettering	with	your	fingers	if	you	had	to.	It	even	smelled	good,	like	fresh	laundry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	hid	the	paper	by	putting	it	in	the	middle	of	the	stack	of	reams	of	paper	for	my computer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	a	world:	Print	up	some	stationery	and	you	have	your	own	business.	If	I were	really	creating	the	Fordgythe	Foundation,	I’d	probably	have	to	do	some stuff	with	a	lawyer.	But	I	was	just	going	to	give	away	money,	and	there’s	no	law against	that.	At	least	none	that	anyone	ever	told	me	about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	downstairs	came	a	“Grrrr.”	If	I	hadn’t	recognized	my	father’s	voice,	I might	have	thought	a	bear	had	moved	in.	Or	possibly	a	large	electric	razor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	Dad	grrrr-ing	about?”	I	asked	my	mother.	She	was	correcting	papers	her class	had	handed	in.	You	usually	don’t	think	about	the	teacher	at	home,	sitting	at a	table	grading	while	the	rest	of	her	life	goes	on	around	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>	has	come	out	in	favor	of	the	state	spending	even	more	money advertising	the	lottery,”	Mom	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Grrrr,”	my	father	explained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	though	my	one	experience	with	the	state	lottery	was	pretty	good,	to	put	it mildly,	I	still	would	have	voted	against	the	state	having	one.	But	it	never	was	to me	a	tenth	the	big	deal	that	it	was	to	my	father.	It	sure	got	my	father	mad.	Worse, I	had	a	good	hunch	that	Mr.	Dunn	had	made	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>	endorse	more	lottery</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>advertising	just	to	make	my	father	angry.	And	it	had	worked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	back	upstairs	and	took	some	recent	copies	of	 <i class="calibre3">The	Gazette</i>	with	me.	I	was looking	for	people	who	could	use	the	helping	hand	of	the	Fordgythe	Institute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	all,	we	are	the	Helping	Hand	People.	About	an	hour	later,	I	biked	down	to the	bank	and	had	a	nice	chat	with	Ms.	Harrigan,	the	woman	who	opened	the account	for	me	when	I	first	won	the	lottery.	I’d	grown	to	trust	her.	For	example, here’s	the	conversation	we	had	that	afternoon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Me:	Hello,	Ms.	Harrigan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ms.	Harrigan:	Good	afternoon,	Jake!	Such	a	pleasure	to	see	you.	Such	a pleasure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Met:	Thank	you.	It’s	nice	seeing	you,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ms.	Harrigan:	What	can	I	help	you	with	this	afternoon? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Me:	Well,	I	had	an	idea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ms.	Harrigan:	Good.	I	like	ideas.	I	 <i class="calibre3">like</i>	ideas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Me:	I	had	this	stationery	printed	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ms.	Harrigan:	Very	nice!	Very,	very	nice!	Did	you	design	this	yourself? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Me:	Yeah.	Well,	I	sort	of	stole	it	from	the	Web.	I	found	a	template. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ms.	Harrigan:	Was	it	for	sale? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Me;	Not	really.	They	said	you	could	use	it	for	free. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ms.	Harrigan:	Not	really	stealing	then,	is	it?	Not	stealing	at	all.	So,	you’re starting	a	foundation.	What	an	excellent	idea!	Excellent! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Me:	Am	I	allowed	to? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ms.	Harrigan:	I	don’t	see	why	not.	Are	you	going	to	cheat	anyone?	Defraud them?	Trick	them	out	of	their	money	and	their	houses? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Me:	No!	I’m	going	to	give	them	money	that	they	really	need. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a>Ms.	Harrigan:	Excellent.	Excellent!	That	sounds	like	so	much	fun!	Fun!	And how	much	do	you	need	this	afternoon? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Me:	I	was	thinking	I’d	start	with	$50,000. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ms.	Harrigan:	In	hundreds?	Thousands? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Me:	I	think	thousands	would	be	best. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ms.	Harrigan:	Excellent.	Excellent.	Could	you	just	wait	here	for	a	minute	and I’ll	go	get	the	forms	and	the	cash?	Just	for	a	minute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Me:	Thank	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ms.	Harrigan:	No,	thank	 <i class="calibre3">you</i>.	And	there’s	a	copy	of	 <i class="calibre3">People</i>	magazine	there	if you’d	like	to	read	it.  <i class="calibre3">People</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three	minutes	later,	she	came	back	with	an	envelope	with	fifty	$1,000	bills	in	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	even	count	it	because	if	you	can’t	trust	Ms.	Harrigan,	then	who	can	you trust?	Who	can	you	trust? </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	can	be	sure	that	when	I	tucked	that	envelope	into	my	backpack,	I	made double-sure	the	backpack	was	completely	zipped	up	and	that	the	straps	weren’t going	to	break.	I	really	didn’t	want	to	have	to	explain	why	I	was	chasing thousand	dollar	bills	blowing	down	the	street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	got	home,	I	closed	my	door	and	moved	the	money	into	the	Fordgythe envelopes	I’d	had	printed	up,	being	sure	that	only	a	little	of	the	money	was exposed	at	any	one	time,	just	in	case	someone	barged	into	my	room.	Once	the money	was	sorted,	I	just	as	carefully	tied	each	envelope	with	the	pink	and	purple and	green	and	sparkly	yarn	I’d	snagged	from	my	mother.	I	wanted	the	money	to look	festive,	after	all.	Then	I	printed	names	out	on	my	computer	on	sticky-backed	labels	and	made	sure	I	had	the	right	names	on	the	right	envelopes.	When I	was	done,	I	put	the	white	envelopes	back	into	the	big	envelope	from	the	bank, and	zipped	it	all	up	into	my	backpack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	ready. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	first	stop	was	obvious.	I	bicycled	past	the	front	of	Dunn	Village	three	times, making	sure	that	none	of	the	people	I	had	met	there	was	in	the	front	driveway	or</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>looking	out	the	windows.	I	especially	didn’t	want	to	run	into	Mr.	Beecher.	I could	picture	him	lassoing	me	off	of	my	bike.	But	there	were	no	signs	of	activity, so	on	my	fourth	pass,	I	stopped	in	front	of	their	mailbox	and	shoved	the envelope	into	it.	Inside	was	a	carefully	typed	letter	telling	them	that	the Fordgythe	Foundation	had	awarded	them	$30,000	to	be	used	for	the	betterment of	the	building	and	to	provide	services	to	those	who	use	the	building…I’d	read up	on	how	foundations	talk.	And	I	rode	away	quickly	but	calmly,	I	hoped.	My heart	was	beating	fast,	but	not	from	biking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	on	my	way	to	Ms.	Floyd’s	house	when	Ari	flagged	me	down.	I	pulled	up next	to	him	on	the	street.	“What’s	up?”	I	asked.	I	could	tell	he	was	upset	because he	alternated	between	pulling	up	his	pants	and	pushing	back	his	glasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Amanda	and	Roger	broke	up!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh	no,	I	thought.	“Hey,	that’s	great,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lydia	told	me.	She	said	I	should	make	my	move.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	could	imagine	Lydia’s	sarcastic	tone	of	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	really	meant	it,”	Ari	said,	as	if	reading	my	mind.	I	was	impressed.	He usually	wasn’t	that	aware	of	what	people	were	thinking.	“She	said	she’d	help me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	would	she	help	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	she’s	angry	at	Amanda.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?”	I	asked.	I	think	my	left	eyebrow	probably	went	up.	It	does	that sometimes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.	Roger	broke	up	with	Amanda	so	he	could	start	going	with	Balia.”	Balia was	a	pretty	girl	in	class	who	wasn’t	a	complete	jerk.	Now	I	had	a	little	less respect	for	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	why	does	she	want	you	to	move	in	on	Amanda?	That	doesn’t	make	sense.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes	it	does.	It’s	because….Ok,	so	no	it	doesn’t.	But	who	cares?	She	wants	to help	me.	She’s	going	to	meet	me	in	half	an	hour.	Can	you	come?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>“Yeah,	sure.	I	just	have	to	drop	this	off	at	Ms.	Floyd’s.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ms.	Floyd’s	getting	a	Fordgythe	grant?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.	I	think	she’s	a	good	teacher.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	grant	city	here	she	comes!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	much?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	don’t	know	why	I	got	embarrassed.	“Some.	Doesn’t	matter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari	rode	with	me	over	to	Ms.	Floyd’s	apartment.	The	building	was	nothing special,	but	I	liked	that	it	was	an	apartment	because	it	meant	that	anybody watching	couldn’t	tell	exactly	which	mailbox	I	put	the	envelope	into.	As	we	left, I	turned	to	see	the	tip	of	the	white	envelope	visible	through	the	slot.	I	hoped	it made	her	a	little	happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lydia	was	waiting	for	us	in	a	booth	at	the	Soda	Squirt.	The	table	was	piled	with books	and	notebooks,	as	if	Lydia	were	studying	simultaneously	for	nine	exams. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	not	the	“Who	cares?	Whatever!”	Lydia	I	had	grown	to	know	and dislike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	Lydia,”	I	said,	but	before	the	words	were	out	of	my	mouth,	she	was	telling us	to	take	all	the	books	from	our	backpacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look	like	you’re	tutoring	me	or	something,”	she	whispered	urgently.	And	then	I understood	why	she	had	all	her	study	materials	on	display:	she	didn’t	want anyone	to	think	she	was	actually	having	a	social	meeting	with	low-lifes	like	Ari and	me.	We	were	just	too	unpopular	to	be	seen	with. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	took	out	some	books.	As	I	pretended	to	be	looking	something	up	in	my geology	textbook	and	Ari	was	doing	some	cross-referencing	in	his	Spanish	book, I	said,	“So,	why	do	you	want	to	help	Ari	with	Amanda?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	just	so	annoying!”	she	said.	She	sighed	once,	heavily.	“Amanda	obviously has	to	have	another	boyfriend,	immediamento.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a>“Obviously.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	can’t	be	seen	as	a	loser.	Ari	here	is	out	of	the	question,	of	course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari	looked	up	from	his	Spanish	book.	He’d	been	looking	up	“immediamento.”	I could	have	told	him	that	it	wasn’t	in	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At	least	as	a	long-term	boyfriend,”	Lydia	added.	“But	there’s	a	gala	at	the	Dunn Fairways	golf	course	this	weekend	and	Amanda	has	to	go.	And	Mr.	Dunn	liked something	about	Ari	when	he	met	him	at	his	house.	He	said	to	her,	‘How	about that	short	boy	with	the	funny	hair?	He	seemed	to	like	you.’	She	said	no,	but finally	Mr.	Dunn	got	his	way.	So,	it	looks	like	Ari	gets	his	shot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?”	he	said,	pleased.	Clearly	all	the	bad	things	Lydia	had	said	along	the way	hadn’t	registered.	To	him,	it	was	like	the	end	of	a	four-day	drive	to Disneyworld,	when	the	sight	of	the	Magic	Castle	erases	the	tortures	of	sitting	in the	back,	strapped	in	next	to	your	annoying	sister	Maddie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,”	Lydia	said.	Then,	turning	to	me,	she	added,	“Can	you	clean	him	up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	showered	yesterday!”	Ari	protested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	you	help	us?”	I	asked.	“I’m	not	really	sure	what	Amanda	looks	for	in	a cleaned-up	boy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.	I	guess,”	Lydia	said,	putting	a	couple	of	packets	of	fake	sugar	into	her pocketbook.	We	agreed	to	go	into	the	city	together	after	school	on	Wednesday. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lydia	stayed	in	the	Soda	Squirt	while	Ari	and	I	left	so	she	wouldn’t	be	caught exiting	a	public	place	with	the	likes	of	us.	Charming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	were	just	turning	the	corner	when	we	saw	Mimi	looking	in	the	window	of Charms	‘n	Gold,	a	jewelry	store. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi,	Mimi.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mmm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	ok?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a>“Fine,”	she	said,	continuing	to	stare	in	the	window.	I	doubted	that	the	charm bracelets	and	ankle	bracelets	really	interested	her	that	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rather	than	asking	her	again	whether	she	was	ok,	I	said,	“Jewelry	shopping?	I didn’t	think	you	wear	jewelry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	turned	to	look	at	me.	“My	father	got	his	job	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	great!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,”	said	Ari,	positively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	it’s	great,”	Mimi	said	without	enthusiasm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	wrong,	Mimi?	You	don’t	sound	happy	about	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	happy	he	got	his	job	back.	But	…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	nice	of	you	to	try	to	help	him	out,	I	guess.	But	it	really	messed	him	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	did?	How?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	so	out	of	the	blue.	He	was	confused.	Where	did	it	come	from?	Why	him? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Was	it	a	trick	by	Mr.	Dunn?	Was	it	legal?	Was	someone	trying	to	trap	him?	And when	he	didn’t	think	it	was	a	trick,	his	pride	was	hurt.	He’s	never	taken	charity before.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know.	But	he	was	already	upset	about	being	fired.	He	wouldn’t	spend	a	penny of	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	no.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	then	he	got	his	job	back,	so	he	put	the	money	into	the	bank.	And	he	gave me	$50	to	buy	myself	something	here.	And,	no,	I	don’t	like	jewelry,	but	it	looks like	I’ll	have	to	get	something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Mimi	started	to	cry,	I	figured	it	wasn’t	because	she	was	being	forced	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>buy	jewelry.	It	must	have	been	so	hard	to	live	in	her	house	over	the	past	week, and	my	gift	had	made	it	harder.	I	felt	terrible.	“I	only	wanted	to	help,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know.	It’s	not	your	fault.	I	shouldn’t	have	been	angry.	But	you	could	have asked	me	first.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	afraid	you’d	say	no.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	minutes	later,	Mimi,	Ari	and	I	walked	out	of	the	store	with	a	gold necklace	with	a	gold	dolphin	hanging	from	it	that	Mimi	liked	even	though	she went	into	the	store	determined	not	to	like	anything.	I	had	to	pay	an	extra	$29	for it	because	$50	turned	out	not	to	be	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	pay	you	back,”	said	Mimi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	Mimi,	please	don’t.”	I	knew	she	was	saying	that	because	she	was	still	angry at	me.	I	started	to	figure	out	how	long	it	takes	me	to	earn	$29	in	interest,	but stopped	since	that	wasn’t	the	point	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	father’s	paper	is	in	trouble,”	I	said	as	we	walked	home.	“Advertising	is down.	Mr.	Dunn	has	been	lowering	the	price	of	advertising	in	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	we	could	make	up	more	ads,”	Mimi	suggested.	“That’d	help	replace	the advertisers	who	go	with	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>	instead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	we	got	to	my	house,	Ari	asked,	“Can	I	do	the	first	one?	I	have	a	really good	idea.	It’ll	just	take	me	three	minutes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Half	an	hour	later,	Mimi	and	I	paused	our	video	game	and	checked	back	in.	(I was	happy	to	have	an	excuse	to	stop	because	Mimi	was	kicking	my	butt.	I	have the	reflexes	of	a	tired	amoeba.)	“Almost	done,”	Ari	said.	“Another	three minutes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	we	came	up	next	time,	he	was	printing	out	what	he’d	written.	In	bold black	print	it	said:	“Go	Grangers!	We	Love	Ya!”	The	Grangers	are	our	high school’s	baseball	team.	Underneath	there	was	a	drawing	of	a	bowling	ball knocking	down	some	pins.	“That’s	the	only	picture	I	could	find,”	Ari	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a>“Well,	that’s	a	start,”	Mimi	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aren’t	people	going	to	wonder	who	placed	the	ad?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ll	just	figure	it	was	some	school	group.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	quickly	printed	out	another	three	ads	supporting	local	teams,	local	charities, and	the	Selma	Todd	Day	celebrations	when	everyone	in	town	is	supposed	to plant	a	flower.	None	said	anything	about	who	was	donating	the	money	for	the ads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know,	there	are	only	so	many	public	service	announcements	we	can	run,”	I said.	“We	need	to	come	up	with	something	that	sounds	like	a	business	but	that no	one	can	check	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	sat	for	about	thirty	seconds	before	Ari	said,	“We	could	pretend	to	be	opening a	bank.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	what	happens	when	someone	goes	to	the	pretend	bank	and	finds	there’s nothing	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	30	seconds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	could	run	an	ad	for	a	real	bank.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	they’d	be	touchy	about	that.	They’d	come	to	my	father,	wanting	to	know who	placed	the	ad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	waited	45	seconds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari	snapped	his	fingers.	“We	could	make	up	companies.	Like	the	Ace	Flower Shop	and	Nose	Repair.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	what	happens	when	someone	reads	the	ad	and	wants	to	buy	something from	there?”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	just	about	the	same	time,	Mimi	said,	“What	the	heck	is	nose	repair?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you	break	your	nose,”	Ari	said	defensively. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a>“Their	motto	could	be,	‘The	place	to	come	if	you	don’t	smell	so	good,’”	Mimi said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	one	good	thing	about	that	idea,”	I	said,	“is	that	no	one	would	go	to	the store.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	would	that	be	good?”	Ari	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	there’s	no	such	store,”	Mimi	reminded	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ex-Post,	the	store	for	used	fence	posts,”	I	said.	“Nobody	wants	used	fence posts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	cars	outside	seemed	to	be	engaged	in	a	honking	contest.	We	sat.	I	rooted	for the	one	that	made	a	Braaaaaat	sound	like	a	whoopee	cushion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Horning	In,”	I	said,	“We’ll	replace	your	car’s	honk	with	whatever	you	record.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	your	car	horn	will	be	you	yelling	some	rude	remark?	That	sounds	like	a good	idea,”	said	Mimi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	we	can’t	use	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	about	Third	Grade	Masterpieces:	copies	of	famous	paintings	by	third graders.	And	we	could	write	in	small	print	that	it	was	the	stuff	that	their	own parents	didn’t	want,”	Mimi	suggested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Refrigerator	Organizers:	We’ll	come	to	your	house	and	organize	the	stuff	stuck on	your	refrigerator	with	magnets,”	Ari	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	about	Acme	Photo	Fresh	Cement?”	suggested	Mimi.	“The	place	to	take your	pictures	of	fresh	cement.	We	specialize	so	you’re	guaranteed	the	best	fresh cement	photos	anywhere.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari	interrupted	the	a	few	seconds	of	silence	excitedly:	“Cow	Chip	Cookies!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aren’t	cow	chips	what	cows	leave	in	the	field”	Mimi	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah!	That’s	why	no	one	will	want	them!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	bet	we’d	get	some	orders	from	practical	jokers.	People	are	just	crazy,”	Mimi</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>said.	“It’s	got	to	be	something	that	absolutely	no	one	would	want.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Freddy’s	Cow	Chip	String,”	said	Ari. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	doesn’t	even	mean	anything,”	Mimi	said.	She	was	drawing	circles	on	her blue	jeans.	They’d	probably	come	out	in	the	wash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	string	for	stringing	together	cow	chips,	and	they	come	from	Freddy,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari	said	defensively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	isn’t	working,”	I	finally	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope,”	said	Mimi,	agreeing.	(That’s	one	of	the	few	times	when	“Nope”	means you	agree.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	just	need	to	think	harder,”	said	Ari. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	we	don’t.	We	need	to	give	up,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Acme	Bird	Wrappers?”	Ari	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimi	and	I	looked	at	each	other,	sighed,	and	gave	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	16</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	Wednesday	and	this	time	there	were	four	of	us	going	in	to	the	city:	Ari, Mimi,	me	and	Lydia.	Our	mission:	to	get	Ari	outfitted	well	enough	to	look	like	a boy	Amanda	might	actually	go	to	a	social	event	with.	It	was	a	challenge	that even	$100,000,000	might	not	be	enough	to	meet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	given	Mimi	$50	before	we	left	and	Ari	$500	so	that	Lydia	wouldn’t	catch on	that	I	was	the	Sugar	Plum	Fairy	when	it	comes	to	money.	“That’s	too	much!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said	Ari	when	I’d	handed	him	the	cash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hope	so,”	I	said.	“But	you	should	spend	as	much	of	it	as	you	need.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Won’t	Lydia	get	suspicious?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	Mimi	said,	pocketing	her	$50.	“She’s	so	spoiled	she	probably	doesn’t	have any	idea	how	much	things	cost	or	what	a	reasonable	amount	to	spend	is.	She	just assumes	everyone	has	enough	money	to	afford	anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	why	she	stuck	me	with	the	bill	at	the	Soda	Squirt	the	other	day,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	she	was	being	cheap,	but	she	was	really	just	being	spoiled.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	that’s	a	lot	better,”	said	Mimi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	ever	lose	that	girlish	sarcasm,”	I	said	to	her	sarcastically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	I	tell	you	this	one	little	thing	that	happened	on	the	train	ride	in,	you’ll	know everything	you	need	to	know	about	Lydia.	But	first	you	have	to	understand	that Lydia	doesn’t	like	me.	Of	course,	she	only	doesn’t	like	me	on	those	rare occasions	when	she	actually	notices	me.	The	rest	of	the	time,	I’m	not	worth	not liking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	the	four	of	us	are	sitting	on	the	train.	I’m	sitting	next	to	Mimi	and	across from	Ari.	Lydia	is	sitting	next	to	the	window,	facing	forward,	because	that’s	the best	seat	of	the	four,	so	of	course	she	assumed	it	as	her	rightful	throne.	About twenty	minutes	go	by.	The	three	of	us	keep	trying	to	engage	Lydia	in conversation.	But	she	fans	her	face,	says	“Whatever,”	and	continues	to	thumb through	her	fashion	magazine.	I	go	out	of	my	way	to	try	to	pull	her	into	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>conversation.	“So,	it	looks	like	bright	colors	are	coming	in,”	I	say,	pointing	at	the cover	of	her	magazine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lydia	rolls	her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	think	bright	colors	aren’t	coming	in?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lydia	rolls	her	eyes	some	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	what	do	you	think	the	new	thing	in	fashion	is	going	to	be?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,”	she	says,	“I’m	trying	to	read,	ok?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	other	words,	it’s	just	a	typical	conversation	with	Lydia	in	which	she	makes	it clear	that	I	am	less	interesting	than	crusted-over	porridge	stuck	on	a	bowl	you find	behind	your	bed	that	you	forgot	since	last	winter.	Not	that	that’s	ever happened	to	me.	The	point	is:	This	is	someone	who	really	doesn’t	like	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	then	Mimi	gets	up	to	go	to	the	bathroom.	And	as	soon	as	she’s	gone,	Lydia lowers	the	magazine	from	her	face	just	enough	to	show	her	eyes.	“You’ve	got your	own	style,	you	know,”	she	says	looking	straight	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	kidding	me?	I	have	style?	I	wear	the	same	shirt	a	week	at	a	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	a	style.	A	style	is	your	way	of	showing	who	you	are.”	Why	did	I	feel	like she	must	have	just	read	that	in	her	magazine?	“And	you	show	exactly	who	you are.	You	always	have.	Even	when	we	were	in	third	grade	together.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh,	I	remember	Lydia	in	the	third	grade	all	right.	She	was	the	one	who	took	the last	piece	of	black	construction	paper	just	because	she	knew	that	I	wanted	it.	She cut	one	little	circle	out	of	the	center	and	then	“forgot”	to	paste	it	on	the	drawing she	was	making.	Yeah,	sure,	she	was	admiring	my	style	back	then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	you’re	the	first	person	ever	to	say	I	have	anything	other	than	a	complete lack	of	fashion	sense.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a>“Why	do	you	care	what	other	people	say	when	you	have	me	saying	something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	she	flutters	her	eyelids,	smiles	just	a	bit,	and	goes	back	to	reading. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari	looks	at	me	amazed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	look	at	Ari	popeyed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’s	flirting	with	me.	Why?	Because	Mimi	left	and	Lydia	thinks	she	can	and should	control	every	boy	within	a	thirty	foot	radius,	even	if	-	and	this	is	the creepy	part	-	she	doesn’t	like	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	Mimi	returned,	saw	Ari	and	me	looking	at	each	other	with	our	eyebrows practically	on	top	of	our	heads	with	amazement.	“Later,”	I	said	to	Mimi.	“Later.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">When	we	got	off	the	train,	Ari	turned	to	the	right	to	head	uptown.	“Where	are you	going?”	Lydia	demanded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To	Mr.	Sidney’s,”	Ari	said	as	if	it	were	obvious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Sidney’s”	Lydia	repeated	as	if	Ari	had	said	that	he	was	eager	to	catch	a	case of	bubonic	plague.	“Who	goes	to	Mr.	Sidney’s?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	where	my…”	Ari	began	and	caught	himself	before	admitting	what	we	all knew:	His	mother	takes	him	shopping.	Just	like	Mimi.	Just	like	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimi	pulled	Ari’s	sleeve	towards	the	left.	“We’ll	go	where	we	usually	go,”	she said.	“The	Blue	Gnu.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	we’ve	never…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Blue	Gnu,”	Mimi	repeated	insistently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,”	said	Ari.	“Yeah,	the	ol’	Gnu.	I	thought	you	said	the,	um,	Boo	Hoo,	and I’m	all	like,	what’s	that,	I	never	heard	of	it…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t	believe	you	go	to	the	Blue	Gnu,”	said	Lydia.	“Actually,	I	totally	believe it.	That	would	explain	so	much,”	she	said,	looking	at	Ari	up	and	down,	from plaid	shirt	to	gigantic	sneakers.	“We’re	going	to	La	Plaz.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a>“La	Plaz?”	said	Ari.	“Oh,	yeah,	that’s	the	other	place	we	always	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.	Right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Taxi,”	I	shouted,	and	one	zoomed	to	a	stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">La	Plaz	was	the	type	of	fancy	shop	that	has	a	store	window	filled	with	symbols of	decay.	At	the	moment,	it	had	a	Roman	Empire	theme	with	broken	columns over	which	were	thrown	sweaters	so	expensive	that	they	didn’t	have	price	tags. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next	to	the	columns	were	three	dead	indoor	trees	from	which	hung	three	shirts, carefully	crumpled.	I	don’t	know	why	they	think	that	anyone	will	look	at	that display	and	decide,	“You	know	what	I	don’t	have	enough	of?	Crumpled	up	shirts lying	around.	And	not	just	any	old	crumpled	shirts:	I’ve	got	to	get	myself	some really	expensive	ones.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	went	in	anyway,	following	Lydia,	who	seemed	so	at	home	there	that	I expected	her	to	flop	onto	the	floor	and	start	doing	homework…if	Lydia	ever actually	did	homework.	A	clerk	dressed	in	a	shirt	with	one	short	sleeve	and	one no-sleeve	came	over	and	pecked	Lydia	on	both	checks.	“Lydia,	my	dear,	so	good to	see	you.	Do	come	and	take	a	look	at	what	we	have	new	for	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually,	Antoine,	I’m	here	for…him.”	She	pointed	at	Ari	as	if	he	were	a	stain on	the	carpet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh.	I	see.”	Then,	remembering	that	he	was	a	Style	Professional,	Antoine	turned to	Ari	and	said	in	a	more	upbeat	tone,	“Why	don’t	you	come	with	me.	My	name is	Antoine	and	I’ll	be	working	with	you.”	Then,	turning	to	Lydia	again:	“Is	there an	occasion?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	taking	Amanda	to	a	dance	at	the	country	club.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	my,”	said	Antoine,	completely	failing	to	mask	his	surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Antoine	whisked	Ari	away.	Lydia	followed,	to	pass	judgment	on	Antoine’s suggestions.	It	was	as	if	she	were	Ari’s	clothing	attorney,	defending	his	rights	in fashion	court. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	should	be	prepared	for	the	unexpected,”	I	said	to	Mimi	as	we	browsed among	racks	of	clothing	that	would	look	very	weird	on	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>“Do	you	think	Ari	is	cruising	for	a	bruising	with	Amanda?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	see	how	it	could	turn	out	well	for	him,”	I	said.	“There’s	no	chance	she’s actually	going	to	fall	for	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	even	if	she	did,	that’d	probably	only	make	him	more	miserable.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	not	much	chance	of	happiness	coming	out	of	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,”	Mimi	said	as	she	held	a	thing	with	polka	dots	up	to	her,	“what	were	you and	Ari	making	faces	about	on	the	train?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	it	was	so	weird.	You	know	how	Lydia	treats	me	like	dirt?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dirt?	No,	that	implies	that	she	notices	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	soon	as	you	left	for	the	bathroom,	she	started	to	talk	to	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	fact,	I’m	pretty	sure	we	actually	made	eye	contact.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	breakthrough!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	finally	figured	it	out.	She	was	flirting	with	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.	I’m	pretty	sure.	It	was	just	so	weird	since	she	doesn’t	even	like	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	she	does.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nah.	I	think	it’s	just	a	natural	reaction	with	her,	like	a	frog	sticking	out	its tongue	to	get	a	fly	even	if	it’s	not	hungry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	better	not	leave	the	two	of	you	alone	together.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Help	me,”	I	said	to	Mimi	in	a	high	voice	like	the	character	in	the	movie	 <i class="calibre3">The	Fly</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">-	the	original	version,	not	the	Jeff	Goldblum	version	that	my	parents	think	I haven’t	seen	because	it’s	too	gross. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a>Ari	came	toward	us	from	the	back	of	the	store.	Lydia	had	chased	us	out	of	there after	Mimi	had	rolled	her	eyes	at	the	puffy-sleeved	green-and-pink	striped	shirt that	Antoine	had	pulled	out	for	Lydia’s	inspection.	Ari	was	walking	quickly	and whispered	in	my	ear:	“I	need	more	money.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?	I	gave	you	$500.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	jacket	and	pants	she’s	picked	for	me	cost	more	than	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	much	do	you	need?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	it	may	be	around	$1,000	by	the	time	she’s	through.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sighed.	I	had	the	money	but	it	seemed	such	a	waste. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sorry,”	Ari	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	be.	It	makes	zero	difference,”	I	said,	handing	him	a	wad	of	bills.	He slipped	them	into	his	pocket,	only	dropping	two	hundreds	on	the	way.	Mimi scooped	them	out	and	gave	them	back	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	insane,”	Ari	said.	“She’s	getting	me	stuff	that	no	one	on	the	planet actually	wears.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	we	see?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	doesn’t	want	you	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,”	said	Mimi,	“Tough.	I’m	coming	back	with	you.	We’re	your	friends	and we	should	be	allowed	at	least	to	see.	I	promise	not	to	roll	my	eyes	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	back	of	the	store,	there	was	a	special	spot	for	special	customers.	It	had three	comfortable	chairs	facing	a	slightly	raised	platform	where	the	victim	-	um, customer	-	could	stand	and	admire	himself	or	herself	in	the	three	angled	mirrors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari	stepped	onto	the	platform.	I	could	swear	that	the	mirrors	did	the	fun	house trick	of	lengthening	the	reflection	so	that	you’d	look	just	a	little	taller	and skinnier.	Clever,	tricky	store. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Antoine	came	forward	carrying	an	arm	full	of	ties	that	ranged	in	color	from	pea soup	green	to	mold	green.	Apparently	sickening	shades	of	green	were	in	this</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>year.	He	began	holding	them	up	to	the	shirt	on	the	top	of	the	pile	and	tossed	each aside	with	great	certainty	although	each	looked	equally	ugly	to	me.	At	last	he came	to	one	that	looked	like	a	muddy	tire	had	run	over	an	iguana.	“Perfect!”	he exclaimed.	“And,	I	think	you	should	take	this	one,	too,”	he	said,	holding	up	one that	looked	like	moss	growing	on	a	tire,	“just	in	case	the	après	party	calls	for something	more	festive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Antoine	looked	at	Lydia.	Lydia	looked	at	her	watch.	“Yes,”	said	Antoine.	“I believe	our	Mr.	Ari	is	outfitted.	Yes?”	Lydia	nodded.	“Let	me	get	these	boxed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	waved	and	magically	another	attendant	arrived	who	dared	not	look	Antoine in	the	eye.	The	attendant	gathered	up	the	shirts,	ties,	pants,	jackets,	socks, underpants,	undershirts,	and	shoes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quite	a	load,”	I	said	as	Mr.	Antoine	went	away	to	total	the	amount	and probably	to	order	cruise	tickets	to	celebrate	the	sale.	“What	do	you	think, Lydia?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	he’ll	be	well-dressed,”	she	said,	implying	that	that’s	the	most	Ari	would ever	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Antoine	returned	with	two	pages	of	bills	on	a	small	tray	made	out	of	some nearly-extinct	wood.	“And	how	will	Mr.	Ari	pay?	Credit	card,	may	I	assume?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	prefer	cash,”	said	Ari,	pulling	a	crumpled	wad	of	bills	out	of	his	pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowly	he	began	counting	out	the	amount.	Bill	after	bill,	Antoine	carefully	tested each	to	make	sure	that	it	wasn’t	two	stuck	together,	then	righted	each	so	that	it was	face	up	and	facing	forward,	then	smoothed	and	stacked	it.	The	hundreds, then	the	twenties,	then	the	tens,	then	the	five,	then	the	ones.	At	last	he	was	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But,	no,	he	began	digging	in	his	pocket	for	change. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	quite	all	right,	Mr.	Ari.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	owe	you	thirty-two	cents.”	So	we	all	stood	as	Ari	counted	out	five	nickels and	then	the	pennies.	“I	need	one	more,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	dug	in	my	pocket	and	gave	him	a	nickel.	“You	owe	me	five	cents,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	three	of	us	picked	up	his	bundles	and	staggered	out	the	door,	Antoine following	behind	like	a	father	sending	his	son	to	college,	so	proud	was	he.	Lydia was	empty-handed	except	for	a	small	bag	with	a	sweater	that	Antoine	had	given</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>her	for	steering	the	rich	Mr.	Ari	into	the	palace	of	fashion	that	was	La	Plaz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	stagnant,	smoggy,	sooty	air	of	the	city	never	felt	so	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	went	to	lunch	at	Lydia’s	favorite	restaurant,	a	place	that	had	food combinations	no	one	had	ever	tried	before,	usually	for	good	reason.	It	was	just	a block	past	the	Salzburg	Grille	where	we	had	had	lunch	the	last	time	we	were	in the	city.	As	we	approached,	all	three	of	us	looked	to	see	Philip	and	Caroline. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	spot	was	empty.	Even	the	rags	where	Spunky	had	slept	were	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	17</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	now	reading	both	 <i class="calibre3">The	Gazette</i>	and	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>	especially	carefully.	I	took both	upstairs	as	soon	as	they	arrived	and	went	through	them	article	by	article.	I wasn’t	only	looking	at	which	advertisers	were	sticking	with	my	father.	I	was	also checking	to	see	who	was	in	trouble	and	might	benefit	from	a	grant	from	the Fordgythe	Foundation.	And	there	were	lots	of	candidates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	example,	the	animal	shelter	was	overstuffed	and	under-funded.	They’d	gone to	the	Town	Council	to	get	emergency	money	because	they	were	out	of	room	for stray	animals,	but	the	Town	Council	voted	to	give	them	only	half	of	the	money they	needed,	a	measly	$5,000.	The	poor	little	doggies	looked	so	cute	and	sad	in the	photo	the	paper	ran.	The	cats	would	have	looked	cute	and	sad	if	I	cared	about cats.	I	left	that	job	to	Mimi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	there	was	the	Burnish	Bob	project.	Some	citizens	were	distressed	that	the big	statue	of	Robert	Melville	in	the	triangular	park	at	the	center	of	town	was black,	green	and	white	instead	of	the	bright	bronze	it	started	out	as.	Some	people had	started	a	petition	to	get	the	statue	scrubbed	and	restored,	especially	the	white part	which	was,	well,	pigeon	poop.	Yes,	apparently	Robert	Melville,	founder	of our	town	and	the	maker	of	fine	cannons	during	the	War	of	1812,	was	also	our pigeon	population’s	most	appealing	public	restroom.	Heck,	sometimes	I	was tempted	myself	to	…	well,	never	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	can’t	say	that	the	Burnish	Bob	project	mattered	very	much	to	me.	I’d	let	Bob wear	his	coat	of	white	proudly	if	the	money	could	instead	go	to	help	those	cutey-wootey	widdle	puppies.	Not	that	I’d	ever	talk	that	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	ahead	and	dropped	off	a	bundle	of	money	at	the	animal	shelter,	neatly	tied with	my	mother’s	yarn	and	with	a	note	on	my	expensive	Fordgythe	paper.	But	I couldn’t	decide	what	to	do	about	the	stupid	statue	problem.	It’s	not	a	project	I cared	about,	but	apparently	it	meant	a	lot	to	other	people.	So	why	should	I	spend my	money	on	it?	Because,	no	matter	how	dumb	it	seemed	to	me,	polishing	Bob would	make	a	bunch	of	people	happier.	Besides,	in	the	time	I	spent	thinking about	it,	I’d	practically	earned	enough	interest	to	pay	for	it.	So,	Bob	got	his $6,500. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	there	were	more	projects	just	waiting	to	be	pushed	along.	I	contributed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a>$30,000	to	a	scholarship	fund	so	that	the	Corner	Coop	Pre-School	could	take	in kids	whose	parents	couldn’t	afford	to	send	them.	Maddie	had	gone	there	when she	was	four	and	I’d	always	enjoyed	going	with	my	mother	to	pick	her	up because	the	library	paste	smelled	so	good.	Also,	Rachel	the	teacher	was	so enthusiastic	about	“opening	up	the	minds	of	young	people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	I	read	about	an	immigrant	from	Honduras	who	was	going	to	be	sent	back because	she	didn’t	fill	in	a	form	right	even	though	she	was	taking	care	of	her sick	brother.	So,	I	mailed	her	$10,000	so	she	could	get	a	good	lawyer	and	also get	some	help	for	her	brother.	I	had	no	idea	if	that	was	enough	or	too	much,	but it	seemed	like	a	reasonable	guess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	there	was	the	School	Summer	Gala.	It	was	on	the	verge	of	being cancelled.	This	was	big	enough	news	to	make	it	onto	the	front	page,	although	I didn’t	notice	it	at	first	because	the	cutey-wootey-kazootie	picture	of	the	widdle-biddle	puppy-wuppies	distracted	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Summer	Gala	was	a	big	deal.	Every	year,	on	the	weekend	that	school	ended, there’d	be	a	huge	picnic	in	the	afternoon	followed	by	an	evening	party	for	all grades,	parents	invited.	And	this	wasn’t	just	a	spread-out-a-tablecloth	sort	of picnic.	This	was	free	food	and	soda,	pony	rides,	a	magician	wandering	around,	a dunk-the-teachers	booth,	and	a	cake	big	enough	to	feed	the	entire	school	with enough	left	over	for	throwing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Normally	the	money	was	provided	by	local	businesses	who	kicked	into	the school’s	Activities	Funds	in	return	for	a	mention	in	the	year	book	and	a	small sign	strung	up	on	the	fence	behind	the	basketball	court	where	the	beverages	were served.	This	year,	though,	there’d	been	a	big	drop	in	contributions,	probably because	the	whole	town	was	going	through	a	hard	time	when	it	came	to	money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I,	of	course,	was	having	a	fabulously	good	year	when	it	came	to	money.	So	the Summer	Gala	got	the	money	it	needed	from	a	source	it	wasn’t	expecting	and	had never	heard	of. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">That	night	was	the	country	club	dance.	I’d	arranged	for	a	limo	to	pick	up	Ari. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	first	it	picked	up	me	and	Mimi	a	few	blocks	from	Mimi’s	house.	From	there the	limo	driver	-	a	college	student	who	was	making	some	money	on	the weekends	-	went	to	pick	up	Ari	in	his	new	clothes.	The	driver	let	Mimi	and	me</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a>off	at	the	country	club	and	then	went	to	pick	up	Amanda. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	country	club	was	set	back	from	the	road	a	long	way.	Of	course	the	lawn	on either	side	of	the	road	leading	up	to	it	was	perfectly	manicured.	Of	course attendants	in	silly	uniforms	opened	the	doors	of	the	elegant	cars	for	the	elegant people	inside.	Of	course	the	big	gates	were	kept	locked.	Mimi	and	I	sat	halfway up	the	lawn,	behind	one	of	the	few	bushes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	bet	he	tugs	on	his	underwear	when	he	gets	out	of	the	car,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	Not	even	Ari	would	do	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	does	it	every	time	he	gets	up	from	a	seat.	He’s	got	a	permanent	wedgie.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	didn’t	have	to	wait	long	to	find	out.	The	big,	black	limo	pulled	up.	I	knew	it was	Ari’s	because	the	license	plate	was	“HERNITE”	which	I	at	first	thought	was the	name	of	some	mineral	but	then	I	figured	out	it	was	actually	supposed	to	be read	as	“her	nite”	as	in	“her	nite	out.”	It	came	to	a	slow	stop	at	the	top	of	the gravel	driveway.	Immediately	the	attendants	swarmed	around	it	as	if	opening	the car	door	were	a	matter	of	national	urgency.	Out	poked	the	long	legs	of	Amanda looking	splendid	in	an	organdy	chenille	dress.	(Mimi	told	me	what	it	was	later.) And	then	came	Ari,	new	shoes	first,	then	carefully	pressed	new	pants,	followed by	the	complete	Ari,	looking	pretty	sharp.	If	you	didn’t	know	it	was	Ari,	you’d say	he	was	a	good	dresser.	The	feet	hit	the	ground,	Ari	shook	his	shoulders	to straighten	his	coat,	shot	his	arms	forward	to	get	them	out	of	the	cuffs,	reached behind	to	his	butt…and	took	out	his	wallet	to	tip	the	attendant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cool	move!”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	were	totally	wrong,	mister.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	never	happier	to	be	so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Ari	replaced	the	wallet,	I	could	see	that	he	was	secretly	working	on	removing the	wedgie.	But	it	was	subtle,	almost	slick.	The	boy	was	going	to	be	ok. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimi	and	I	sat	for	a	moment	more,	listening	to	the	sound	of	the	band	drifting over	the	wall.	Then	we	took	a	long	walk	to	my	house	so	she	could	kick	my	butt in	video	games. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a>Three	hours	later,	Ari	was	knocking	on	our	door.	The	knock	alarmed	my	parents, but	when	my	mother	saw	it	was	Ari,	she	only	said	“Eleven’s	a	little	late,	don’t you	think,	Ari?”	But	as	Mimi	and	I	flew	down	the	stairs	to	meet	him,	I	said	to them,	“Girl	trouble.	He	wants	to	talk.”	That	probably	alarmed	them	even	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	three	of	us	sat	on	the	swing	set	in	my	yard.	Ari	didn’t	speak.	He	didn’t swing.	He	just	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	Ari,	spill	your	guts!”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,”	chimed	in	Mimi,	“So	what	happened	at	your	big	dinner-dance	date	with the	rich	folk.”	Then,	remembering	the	size	of	my	bank	account,	Mimi	turned	to me	and	said,	“You’re	not	really	a	rich	person.	You’ve	just	got	a	lot	of	money.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,”	said	Ari,	coming	back	to	the	planet	earth,	“it	was	terrible.	So	bad	it	was funny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	no!	But	was	Amanda	at	least	everything	you	hoped	for?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Amanda?”	he	said,	as	if	he	were	unfamiliar	with	the	name,	“She’s	an	idiot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	dumped	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dumped	me?	No.	She	was	never	going	with	me.	It	turns	out	I	was	just	a practical	joke	Lydia	was	playing	on	Amanda	because	after	Amanda	broke	up with	Roger,	Amanda	wouldn’t	let	Lydia	go	out	with	him.	I	was	a	revenge	date.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	must	have	been	so	embarrassing!”	said	Mimi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	said	Ari,	surprised	at	the	suggestion.	“Well,	if	Amanda	weren’t	an	idiot maybe	it	would	have	been.	But	it’s	like	getting	rejected	by	a…	a…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	garden	gnome?”	Mimi	suggested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	fur	ball?”	I	suggested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	it’s	like	being	rejected	by	this	incredibly	shallow,	conceited,	empty-headed…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nasty…”	Mimi	added. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a>“Manipulative…”	I	added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Idiot,”	Ari	finished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	sat	silently	contemplating	what	had	happened:	Ari	had	come	to	his	senses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	I	hadn’t	known	he	even	had	senses	to	come	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimi	squeezed	has	hand.	“She’s	an	idiot.	You’re	definitely	not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari	shook	his	head	slightly,	not	convinced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	moon	poked	out	from	behind	the	clouds,	seeming	to	remind	Ari	of	what	he came	over	to	tell	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	something	really	cool	happened.	I	was	sitting	at	Mr.	Dunn’s	table	…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	were	sitting	at	his	table?	You?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.	He	saw	what	was	happening	and	I	think	he	felt	bad	for	me.	So	he	called me	over	and	I	sat	at	his	table	for	most	of	the	night.	He’s	really	not	such	a	bad guy.	I	mean,	it’s	like	he’s	from	another	planet	with	how	he	treats	people	and what	he	worries	about,	but	on	his	planet	he’s	probably	considered	a	heck	of	a nice	guy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	doubt	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	it’s	true.	He	let	me	sit	there	all	night	so	I	wouldn’t	have	to	deal	with	his idiot	daughter.	Anyway,	he	talked	with	me	a	little,	about	sports	and	why	being	a financial	analyst	would	be	a	good	career	for	me,	but	mainly	I	just	sat	there listening	to	what	he	was	talking	about	with	everyone	who	came	by.	And everyone	did	come	by.	He	knows	everyone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	everyone	who	goes	to	a	country	club	dinner	dance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyway,	he	was	talking	with	some	guy	in	a	tuxedo	about	the	Fordgythe Foundation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes	he	was.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a>“What	did	he	say?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Someone	asked	him	if	he’d	heard	about	this	new	foundation	that’s	been dropping	cash	around,	and	he	said	he	had,	but	I	think	he	was	just	trying	to	sound smart.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	was	the	guy	who	was	talking	with	him?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know.	Just	a	guy.	Friendly	with	him.	Anyhoo,	Mr.	Dunn	asked	the	guy	if he	had	any	details.	But	the	guy	said	just	that	it	was	always	cash,	and	that	the stationery	looked	phony.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	at	all,	dear,”	said	Mimi,	comforting	me.	But	we	both	knew	that	the	guy	-</p>
<p class="calibre1">whoever	that	guy	was	-	was	right.	I’m	not	a	grown	up,	professional	designer,	and I’m	not	ashamed	to	admit	it.	Much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyhoo…”	I	prompted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	about	it.	Except	Mr.	Dunn	said	that	he	had	someone	at	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i> looking	into	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	if	he	didn’t	before,	he	does	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Should	we	be	worried?”	Ari	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	until	we	do	something	wrong.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	was	worried	a	little.	I	didn’t	want	anyone	to	find	out	who	was	behind	the Fordgythe	Institute’s	money.	And	I	didn’t	want	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>	to	scoop	my	own father’s	paper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	needn’t	have	worried.	The	very	next	day	when	I	came	down	to	watch	TV	in	the study,	my	father	was	on	the	phone,	standing	in	his	journalism	pose.	You	know how	when	you’re	in	a	crowd	you	turn	your	head	if	you	hear	your	name mentioned	even	though	you	weren’t	listening	to	the	person	who	said	it?	I	wasn’t paying	attention	to	my	father’s	conversation	until	I	heard	him	say, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Foundation?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a>“Yes,	definitely.	Very	interesting.	I’ll	check	into	it.	Thanks	for	the	tip.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he’d	hung	up,	I	said	-	all	casual-like	-	“Who	was	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	source.”	Obviously	he	wasn’t	going	to	tell	me	who. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hot	tip? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Could	be.	An	interesting	story.	It	seems	that	some	foundation	no	one	ever	heard of	has	been	giving	people	money.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	foundations	do	that	all	the	time?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sure.	But	not	cash.	And	not	to	people	who	haven’t	applied	for	a	grant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Interesting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	going	to	look	into	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you	need	any	help…”	I	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I’m	sure	you	can	get	whatever	help	you	need.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	back	to	the	TV.	But	I	wasn’t	really	watching.	I	was	thinking	about whether	I	had	covered	my	tracks	well	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	18</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">That	afternoon,	we	prepared	more	bundles	of	cash.	Twenty	in	all,	each	wrapped in	my	Mom’s	yarn.	Each	recipient	had	been	researched	on	line.	Each	was	needy and	worthy.	I	felt	good	about	what	we	were	about	to	do.	There	was	one	big difference	from	the	previous	donations:	eighteen	of	the	twenty	were	in	the	city because	I	didn’t	want	to	get	caught	by	either	of	the	two	local	papers investigating	my	Foundation.	We	printed	up	the	notices,	tucked	one	into	each bundle,	and	set	off	for	the	train	station,	the	bundles	in	a	brown	bag	in	my backpack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um,	you	might	want	to	zip	that	thing,”	Mimi	said	as	I	was	getting	on	my	bike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	leaned	over	and	zipped	my	backpack	for	me.	“We	don’t	want	to	get	there and	find	out	that	$80,000	was	lying	in	a	brown	paper	bag	by	the	side	of	the	road somewhere.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	But	you	know	what	the	scary	thing	is?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’d	just	be	a	bother	to	go	down	to	the	bank	again,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	had	a	tight	schedule	in	the	city:	Eighteen	places	to	go	and	just	a	few	hours	to do	it	in	if	we	were	to	make	it	back	in	time	for	dinner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	of	the	bundles,	plain	white	envelopes	with	labels	printed	out	from	my computer,	were	easy	to	deliver.	We	could	have	taken	a	single	cab,	leapt	out,	and continued	to	the	next	stop,	but	we	didn’t	want	the	cabby	to	figure	out	that	we were	the	ones	leaving	the	little	bundles	of	joy.	So,	we’d	go	uptown	to	the	address of	a	health	clinic	that	we’d	read	was	on	the	verge	of	closing,	we’d	leave	the envelope	in	its	mail	box,	and	either	walk	to	the	next	spot	or	take	a	cab.	An	A student	who	couldn’t	afford	college,	a	veteran’s	club	that	was	raising	money	for a	new	roof,	a	little	something	for	a	woman	who	spent	her	weekends	doing puppet	shows	in	the	children’s	hospital	-	they	all	got	their	envelopes,	as	did another	ten	people	or	organizations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	left	five	more	bundles	for	the	city.	It	didn’t	take	long	to	find	five	people living	on	the	streets.	We’d	listen	to	them	and	then	look	at	one	another.	If	we	all</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a>agreed,	we’d	give	them	an	envelope.	“You	can	probably	use	this.	It’s	completely legal.	Just	spend	it	well,	ok?”	And	then	we’d	leave	before	they	could	open	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	truth	is,	I	still	wasn’t	sure	that	that	was	a	good	way	to	spend	the	money.	I knew	the	argument	that	they’ll	just	spend	it	on	alcohol	or	drugs.	But	I’ll	tell	you the	part	of	the	argument	that	I	didn’t	like:	the	“they”	part.	They	weren’t	“they.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’re	people,	each	different.	And	some	might	use	the	money	to	get	drunk	for months.	But	maybe	they	wouldn’t.	I	don’t	know	that	even	“they”	know	ahead	of time	what	the	effect	of	$1,000	in	cash	would	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	made	it	back	just	before	our	parents	would	be	getting	annoyed	at	us.	I	asked my	parents	if	I	could	go	out	for	another	twenty	minutes.	That	gave	me	just enough	time	to	drop	off	the	last	two	bundles.	A	veteran	and	a	synagogue	were going	to	have	a	better	day	than	they	thought	they	were	going	to	have. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	way	back,	I	put	an	envelope	in	the	mail.	It	was	addressed	to	my	father and	inside	was	a	message	from	the	Fordgythe	Foundation.	I	used	a	font	I’d downloaded	especially	so	that	Dad	wouldn’t	recognize	it	as	having	coming	from my	computer.	It	was	an	ugly	font,	but	better	ugly	than	recognizable.	I	figured	my father	would	get	the	letter	the	next	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	night	when	we	sat	down	to	dinner,	my	father	couldn’t	wait	to	tell	us	his news.	He	was	so	excited	that	he	started	buttering	a	second	roll	before	he	realized he	hadn’t	eaten	the	first.	“You’ll	never	guess	what	happened,”	he	said.	I	tried	not to	blurt	out:	“You	received	a	mysterious	letter	in	the	mail!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	got	a	phone	call,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Odd,	I	thought.	I	was	quite	sure	I	had	mailed	him	a	letter	and	not	phoned	him.	I mentally	reviewed	the	difference	between	a	mailbox	and	a	phone	booth.	Yup,	I had	definitely	sent	him	mail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	debate	over	the	lottery	is	set.	It’s	in	three	weeks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	wonderful,”	said	my	mother.	“Did	they	send	you	a	contract?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	mother’s	father	was	a	lawyer	and	taught	her	not	to	believe	anything	is	going to	happen	unless	there’s	a	signed	contract.	That’s	why	she	doesn’t	believe weather	reporters	on	TV.	“They	can	say	whatever	they	want	and	there’s	no accountability.”	Accountability	means	that	if	you’re	wrong	about	the	weather, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a>you	get	punished.	My	mother	would	like	weathermen	to	get	paid	according	to how	many	right	predictions	they	make. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	yet,”	my	father	said,	“but	the	show	is	on	their	schedule.	And	do	you	know who	I’m	going	to	be	debating?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	waited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Geoffrey	Dunn.”	Amanda’s	father.	Mr.	Dunn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	so	exciting,”	my	mother	said.	“That	will	get	more	viewers.”	Mr.	Dunn was	well	known	around	the	state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t	wait	to	start	preparing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	already	well-prepared,”	my	mother	said.	“You’ve	been	researching	this for	years.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know,	but	I	want	to	have	arguments	that	really	work.	And	I	want	to	anticipate the	arguments	that	Mr.	Dunn	will	use.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lotteries	are	good	because	it’s	good	to	be	rich,”	I	suggested	in	a	voice	that	was a	truly	lousy	imitation	of	Mr.	Dunn’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	is	it	better	to	make	one	person	very	rich	at	the	expense	of	many	people	who can’t	afford	it?	Isn’t	the	lottery	really	a	tax	on	the	poor?”	My	father	was speaking	in	his	Public	Speaking	voice,	louder	and	smoother	than	his	real	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	it’s	a	so-called	tax	that	they	choose	to	pay	because	they	get	some enjoyment	from	it,”	I	said	as	Mr.	Dunn.	“Shouldn’t	they	be	allowed	to	choose how	they	get	their	enjoyment?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	get	enjoyment	from	it	because	the	state	tells	them	that	they	have	a	chance of	winning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	they	do	have	a	chance	of	winning.	The	same	chance	as	everyone	else.	And it	says	the	chance	right	on	the	back	of	the	lottery	ticket.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	tiny	print,”	my	father	said,	“while	meanwhile	the	state	is	buying	posters	and billboards	with	very	big	print	to	convince	people	that	they’re	just	one	ticket</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a>away	from	being	rich.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	you	don’t	trust	the	citizens	of	this	fair	state,”	I	said	Dunn-ishly,	“to	make their	own	choices.	You	think	citizens	are	so	easily	fooled.	You	think	we’re	stupid stupid	sheep…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know,”	my	father	said	not	in	his	public	voice,	“that’s	the	hardest	argument to	fight.	I	look	like	an	elitist.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	what-ist?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Someone	who	thinks	he’s	better	than	everyone	else.	Someone	who	thinks	those poor	people	are	just	too	dumb	to	know	what’s	good	for	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	isn’t	that	what	you’re	saying?”	my	mother	asked,	surprising	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	saying	that	I	believe	in	the	power	of	advertising.	It	works.	So,	now	the	state government	is	advertising	how	the	lottery	will	make	you	rich	and	end	all	your worries.	Everyone	can	be	fooled	by	advertising.	That’s	why	companies	spend millions	and	millions	of	dollars	doing	it	to	sell	you	stuff	you	didn’t	originally want.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	it’s	not	the	lottery	you	disagree	with,	but	the	advertising	for	it,”	I	said	as	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dunn	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm,”	my	father	said.	“Take	away	the	advertising	and	the	lottery	is	just	a	bad gamble	that	will	take	money	from	the	poorest	of	us	-	because	studies	show	that poorer	areas	play	lotteries	more	than	richer	areas.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,	the	money	goes	to	education,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	education	budget	-	which,	by	the	way,	I’d	like	to	see	enlarged	-	should	be paid	for	like	every	other	service	the	state	government	provides,”	my	father replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,”	my	mother	said,	doing	an	even	worse	imitation	of	Mr.	Dunn,	“you’d	like to	see	a	tax	increase	on	all	of	us	to	make	up	for	the	money	we’re	raising	for education	through	the	lottery?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	like	to	see	all	the	money	we	need	for	education	given	to	education	without</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a>having	to	rely	on	tricking	people	into	buying	lottery	tickets.	You	don’t	get anything	for	free,	and	if	we	have	to	raise	taxes	a	little	to	pay	for	education,	then, yes,	we	ought	to	be	willing	to	do	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	“You	should	add:	‘…for	the	children.’	That	always	seems	to	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	the	children,”	my	father	said	and	laughed.	“I’ll	try	to	work	that	phrase	in	as much	as	possible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can’t	go	wrong,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	checked	the	Fordgythe	Foundation’s	email	address	every	ten	minutes	the	next day.	At	last,	at	5:30	there	was	a	message	from	my	father: Dear	Anonymous, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	received	your	letter	with	your	offer	to	give	The	Gazette	an	exclusive	email interview	with	the	head	of	the	Fordgythe	Foundation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately,	I	must	decline	this	offer.	It	is	the	policy	of	The	Gazette	not	to engage	in	interviews	solely	through	email	since	with	email	we	can’t	guarantee our	readers	that	we	are	interviewing	the	person	we	think	we’re	interviewing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	you	would	like	to	arrange	to	meet	in	person,	I	would	be	delighted	to	set	up	an appointment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thank	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">PS:	That	is	one	ugly	font	you	used	in	your	letter! </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	much	for	that	plan	for	getting	more	people	to	read	 <i class="calibre3">The	Gaz</i>.	If	only	my	father were	a	little	sleazier! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	19</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">We	had	a	plan	that	I	thought	was	pretty	good.	I	just	didn’t	expect	it	to	be	so completely	interrupted	by	a	pancake	breakfast.	But	then,	the	town	Fireman’s Pancake	Breakfast	is	always	at	least	a	little	surprising. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	something	our	town	does	to	raise	money	for	extra	activities	that	our	taxes don’t	pay	for.	I’ve	been	going	ever	since	I	was	a	tadpole	because	my	father,	as the	editor	of	the	town’s	best	newspaper,	is	always	invited	and	sits	at	the	table	at the	head	of	the	room.	Oh,	and	gets	pancake	syrup	poured	on	him.	Every	year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	call	it	a	tradition,	but	I	think	it’s	just	plain	hilarious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	father	says	it	began	before	I	was	born	when	he	threw	a	pancake	Frisbee-style at	Alderman	Byrd.	Alderman	Byrd	threw	it	back,	but	missed.	So	he	got	up slowly	and	carefully,	and	poured	an	entire	pitcher	of	maple	syrup	over	my father’s	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	said,	hilarious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	turned	into	a	tradition	the	next	year	when	my	father	made	the	mistake	of showing	up	in	a	raincoat	and	rain	hat,	the	sort	that	salty	old	seamen	wear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alderman	Byrd	took	this	as	a	challenge.	The	next	year	my	father	brought	an umbrella.	And	after	that,	he	gave	up	trying	to	protect	himself.	He	shows	up	in	a shirt	he	doesn’t	care	too	much	about	and	sits	there	silently	as	Alderman	Byrd syrups	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	year,	the	money	raised	by	the	breakfast	was	going	to	a	cause	that	Mimi cared	about	a	lot.	The	Tulip	Time	Nursery.	It’s	a	daycare	center	that	the	town funds	for	families	that	can’t	afford	the	more	expensive	ones.	Mimi	volunteers there	during	the	summer	and	goes	on	some	of	their	class	trips.	Over	the	past	few years,	the	town	had	given	the	Tulip	Troop,	as	the	kids	were	known,	less	and	less money	because	there	wasn’t	much	money	to	give	out.	The	nursery	raised	some money	through	donations	and	bake	sales.	They	even	sold	the	tiny	little	tomatoes and	half-grown	cucumbers	that	the	Troop	spent	all	summer	growing.	I’d	pass	by the	garden	sometimes,	and	the	sight	of	those	little	kids	whacking	at	the	ground with	their	plastic	hoes	as	if	they	were	actually	gardening	was	maybe	the	cutest thing	I’d	ever	seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a>So,	when	Alderman	Byrd	asked	Mimi	to	help	put	up	signs	advertising	the Pancake	Breakfast,	she	was	torn.	On	the	one	hand,	she	wanted	to	raise	money for	the	Tulip	Troop,	what	with	them	being	so	cute	and	all.	On	the	other	hand,	she thought	Alderman	Byrd	was	going	too	far:	The	signs	showed	a	big,	juicy	photo of	my	father	looking	calmly	into	the	camera	as	syrup	dripped	over	his	head	and down	off	his	glasses.	The	fact	that	you	also	got	to	eat	pancakes	at	the	breakfast was	hardly	even	mentioned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimi	showed	me	a	copy	of	the	flyer.	“Don’t	worry	about	it,”	I	said	to	her.	“It’ll probably	draw	a	lot	of	people,	and	that’s	what	everyone	wants.	Even	my	father.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	it	gave	me	an	idea	that	required	me	to	hire	my	very	first	employee.	I	needed an	adult	who	could	buy	some	things	without	anyone	getting	suspicious.	“That’s	a great	idea,”	Mimi	said.	“There	are	so	many	things	that’d	be	easier	if	we	had	a grown	up	to	do	them	for	us.”	Even	something	as	simple	as	getting	business	cards printed	up	is	tough	for	a	kid	to	do	without	making	people	suspicious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	who?	One	of	our	teachers?	No,	that	would	make	going	to	school	too complicated	because	we’d	always	have	to	pretend	that	nothing	was	going	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Besides,	I’m	not	sure	it’s	legal	for	students	to	hire	their	teachers.	One	of	my relatives?	No,	they	might	let	the	secret	slip	to	my	parents.	Mr.	Seoul,	the	guy who	drives	the	ice	cream	truck?	He	seemed	like	a	really	nice	guy,	but	I’m	not sure	I’d	trust	with	him	a	$100,000,000	secret. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	it	came	to	me.	Remember	Julia	Minden,	the	teller	at	the	bank	where	all	my money	is?	Probably	not	since	I	only	mentioned	her	once	and	that	was	a	long time	ago.	Ms.	Minden	was	about	twenty-five	years	old,	tall,	and	had	the	sort	of smile	that	is	so	bright	it	makes	you	want	to	duck.	Every	time	I’d	gone	into	the bank,	we’d	chatted	a	little.	I	really	liked	her.	Not	only	was	she	helpful	and cheerful,	but	she	didn’t	treat	me	like	a	little	rich	kid.	Plus,	she	was	already	in	on the	secret.	Mimi	and	I	went	to	see	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	Jake,”	she	said,	like	someone	genuinely	pleased	to	see	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello.	Do	you	know	my	friend	Mimi?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	been	in	with	your	mother.	How	is	your	father	doing,	Mimi?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,”	Mimi	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>“Can	we	talk	with	you	privately	about	something?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course.”	She	caught	the	eye	of	Ms.	Harrigan	who	waved	to	her	that	it	was	ok to	take	a	little	break,	seeing	that	it	was	with	me.	Ah,	the	privileges	having	money gives	you! </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	went	into	one	of	the	bank’s	private	rooms	and	I	laid	out	the	deal:	“We’re looking	for	a	grownup	to	help	us,	and	we’re	wondering	if	you’d	be	interested.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Help	you	do	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Help	us	do	the	things	that	we’re	doing	with	our	money,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	really	 <i class="calibre3">our</i>	money,”	Mimi	said	to	me.	“It’s	yours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	yes,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	we’re	not	doing	anything	evil	with	it,”	Mimi	said.	“There	are	just	some things	that	it’s	really	tough	for	kids	to	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Especially	if	no	one	is	supposed	to	know	that	they	have	money,”	I	added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ms.	Minden	sat	thinking, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’d	pay	you,”	I	said.	I’d	somehow	left	that	part	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would	I	keep	my	job	here	at	the	bank?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	We	would	only	need	you	to	do	things	every	now	and	then.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	at	me	now	like	someone	who	had	made	up	her	mind.	“I	trust	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	I	like	what	you’ve	been	doing	with	the	Fordgythe	Foundation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	about	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	wasn’t	hard	to	figure	out	since	Mrs.	Fordgythe	is	the	one	who	transferred	the money	to	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	you’ll	do	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	be	happy	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a>“Great!”	We	sat	for	a	moment.	“How	much	do	we	pay	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed,	“I	don’t	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	can	you	not	know?	You’re	a	grownup!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	salaries	don’t	work	that	way.	Usually	you’re	not	paid	much	more	or	less than	other	people	in	the	company	doing	the	same	job	with	the	same	amount	of experience.	But	this	isn’t	like	that.	So,	we	just	have	to	figure	something	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,”	I	said,	“It	doesn’t	matter	much	to	me	because	I	have	so	much	money.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I	have	that	going	in	my	favor,”	she	said,	laughing	again.	“But	we’re	just going	to	have	to	come	up	with	an	amount	we	both	think	is	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	here’s	what	happened	in	the	negotiation.	She	began	with	an	amount	that	was about	a	tenth	of	what	she	made	as	a	bank	teller.	By	the	time	we	were	done bargaining,	I	had	gotten	her	to	accept	a	salary	of	half	as	much	as	she	made.	She thought	I	was	terribly	overpaying	her	and	I	thought	I	was	terribly	underpaying her.	I	guess	you	could	call	that	a	successful	compromise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	that	Ms.	Minden	worked	for	me,	I	told	her	my	plan.	She	laughed	and	asked how	she	could	help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	only	one	thing	left	for	me	and	Mimi	to	do:	Download	a	picture	of	Big Bird.	By	the	next	morning	we’d	posted	100	flyers	around	town.	“Big	Byrd invites	you	to	the	Pancake	Breakfast	to	benefit	the	Tulip	Time	Nursery,”	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	in	the	center	was	a	photo	of	Big	Bird	with	Alderman	Byrd’s	face	imposed on	it.	Sometimes	I	love	computers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knew	that	some	people	called	him	Big	Byrd	because	he	was	shaped	roughly like	that	overgrown	chicken	on	 <i class="calibre3">Sesame	Street</i>.	In	fact,	I	once	saw	him	in	shorts in	the	park	and	his	legs	were	as	thin	and	knobby	as	Big	Bird’s.	The	Alderman didn’t	like	the	comparison	at	all.	Not	even	a	little	bit.	So	we	figured	we’d	annoy him	before	the	big	day.	Why	not?	It	was	for	a	good	cause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	day	before	the	breakfast,	Ms.	Minden	sent	me	an	email	saying	that everything	was	all	arranged.	When	I	asked	who	had	built	the	stuff	we	needed,	I was	surprised	to	find	out	that	it	was	Mr.	Paul,	the	Dunns’	butler	and	handyman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	had	to	tell	him	what	it	was	for,”	Ms.	Minden	wrote	back	to	me.	“I	didn’t	want</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a>him	to	think	it	was	for	something	illegal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	trust	him	enough	for	that?”	I	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually,	yes.	Of	course	I	didn’t	mention	your	name	or	anything	about	winning the	lottery.	I	just	said	I	was	doing	some	odd	jobs	for	an	eccentric	rich	person.	But I’ve	known	Mr.	Paul	for	a	while.	We’re	in	a	book	club.	He’s	very	honest.	And	he has	a	great	sense	of	humor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wow.	The	things	you	learn	about	someone	in	a	book	club! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	night	before	the	breakfast,	my	father	was	laying	out	the	clothes	he	was going	to	wear.	Alderman	Byrd	traditionally	poured	carefully	onto	the	top	part	of my	father’s	head	so	that	the	syrup	could	flow	all	down	my	father’s	face.	And from	the	face	it	went	to	the	collar	and	from	there	on	down	until	by	the	time	my father	got	up,	he	left	a	syrup	mark	on	the	seat.	Gross,	when	you	think	about	it, which	I	try	not	to	do.	So,	the	clothes	he	wore	had	to	be	disposable,	but	also	nice enough	that	it	didn’t	look	like	he	was	dressing	for	the	syruping	that	was	bound	to happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	the	checked	shirt	and	the	black	jeans.	“Nice,”	I	said.	“Going	a	little informal	this	year?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	he	said	jokingly,	“It’s	only	a	breakfast.	No	need	to	get	all	dressed	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	sure.	I	mean,	suppose	you	spilled	some,	I	don’t	know,	syrup	on	yourself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	wouldn’t	want	to	get	your	good	clothes	all	sticky.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Spill	syrup?	Why,	what	are	the	chances	of	that?”	he	said	and	laughed.	He picked	out	a	pair	of	nice	fuzzy	socks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wouldn’t	it	be	nice	if	Alderman	Byrd	got	syruped	one	year	instead	of	you?”	I asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ol’	Big	Byrd?	I	wouldn’t	say	no.	But	it’s	a	tradition.	I	don’t	mind	it.	In	fact,	it’s even	sort	of	an	honor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An	honor?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure.”	my	father	said,	running	his	hand	through	what	used	to	be	his	hair.	“They</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a>wouldn’t	do	this	to	someone	they	didn’t	know	and	like.”	Then	he	looked	at	me, panicked:	“Would	they?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	kidding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	wake	you	at	eight	tomorrow,”	Dad	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	probably	be	awake	by	then,”	I	said.	I’d	better	be.	I	had	work	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	breakfast	began	at	nine	o’clock,	but	the	only	ones	who	got	there	that	early were	either	town	officials	like	Big	Byrd	or	those	who	really	wanted	to	get	their money’s	worth	of	the	as-many-as-you-can-eat	pancake	offer.	My	father,	as	a town	notable,	showed	up	shortly	after	nine.	Mimi	was	already	there	because	she didn’t	want	to	miss	a	minute	of	it.	And	in	the	front	of	the	room	at	the	table closest	to	where	the	volunteers	were	serving	the	pancakes	was	Ari,	already	on his	third	plate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	hadn’t	told	Ari	our	plans.	Mimi	had	asked	about	that	a	couple	of	days	earlier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	don’t	we	not,”	I	suggested.	“That	way	he	can	be	surprised	by	what happens.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	it’ll	be	more	fun	for	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	truth,	though,	I	think	something	else	was	going	on.	I	think	Mimi	and	I	wanted to	have	something	that	was	only	ours.	That	may	not	have	been	the	nicest	thing	to do	to	our	friend	Ari,	but	we	had	a	good	excuse…good	for	him	and	good	for ourselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimi	was	watching	for	me.	“Is	everything…?”	she	started	to	ask	as	she	came towards	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	all	done,”	I	said.	It	had	been	done	by	six	am.	Which	meant	that	we’d	started it	at	five	am.	Even	though	it	was	almost	summer,	at	that	time	in	the	morning	it was	chilly.	I’d	met	Mr.	Paul	behind	the	building.	He	was	drinking	coffee	from	an insulated	cup.	It	smelled	good,	and	I	don’t	like	coffee.	So	I	was	very	pleased when	Mr.	Paul	reached	into	his	bag	and	pulled	out	a	thermos	filled	with	hot chocolate	and	an	empty	mug	for	me.	I	guess	being	a	butler	teaches	you	how	to be	considerate.	“Are	you	ready?”	he	asked	me? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	“Did	you	bring	everything?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a>He	pointed	at	the	duffel	bag	next	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	we	entered	the	pancake	house	through	a	window	and	did	what	we	planned	on doing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Phase	2	went	according	to	plan,”	I	said	to	Mimi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Phase	2?	What	was	Phase	1?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know,	figuring	stuff	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	got	good	seats	towards	the	front,	but	out	of	spray	range,	and	chowed	down on	some	pretty	good	pancakes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	speeches	didn’t	begin	until	10:30,	and	they	were	short	because	everyone knew	that	we	weren’t	there	to	hear	local	politicians	drone	on	and	on	about	how proud	they	were	to	support	this	and	oppose	that	and	how	pleased	they	were	to vote	for	giving	the	firefighters	new	red	suspenders.	The	people	in	the	room	were there	for	two	reasons	and	two	reasons	only:	to	eat	pancakes	and	to	watch	my	dad get	syruped.	Every	speech	only	postponed	the	time	when	my	father	would	be drenched	in	sticky,	icky,	gooey	goo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	father	was	doing	his	usual	thing,	pretending	that	he	didn’t	know	anything was	going	to	happen	to	him,	listening	to	the	speeches	as	if	he	were	actually interested	instead	of	wondering	just	when	Selectman	Byrd	would	be	coming over	with	that	big	pitcher	of	maple	syrup. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	usual,	Selectman	Byrd	was	waiting	for	the	end	of	the	speeches	because	as soon	as	he	did	the	deed,	no	one	would	even	pretend	to	listen	to	the	rest	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fifth	town	official	was	finishing	up.	She	was	explaining	how	proud	she	was to	support	the	library’s	new	library	cards,	the	ones	with	a	lovely	picture	of Melvil	Dewey	on	them	-	he	apparently	was	the	inventor	of	the	Dewey	Decimal System	-	and	there	didn’t	seem	to	be	any	town	officials	left.	It	was	just	as	she was	expressing	her	admiration	not	only	for	Dewey	but	for	decimals	-	where would	we	be	without	them?	-	that	Selectman	Byrd	rose	from	his	seat.	Quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	big	fuss.	But	everyone	was	watching	him,	as	he	well	knew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	pretending	to	whistle	casually,	he	was	approaching	my	father	from	behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	was	putting	the	last	bite	of	pancakes	into	his	mouth,	rolling	his	eyes, pretending	to	be	enjoying	them	as	much	as	if	they	were	a	fancy	dessert	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p163"></a>country’s	best	restaurant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Up	creeps	Selectman	Byrd.	And	now	from	behind	his	back	he	brings	the	pitcher of	syrup.	Except	this	time	it’s	not	a	pitcher.	It’s	one	of	those	gigantic	water pistols,	the	type	that	hold	a	gallon.	The	Selectman	is	pumping	it	up	with	air	so that	he’ll	get	a	good	stream	out	of	it.	My	father	must	be	able	to	hear	him,	but	he acts	as	if	nothing	is	going	on	behind	him.	People	are	giggling.	All	eyes	are	on the	Selectman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	watching	the	closest	are	me	and	Mimi	because	everything	depends	on Selectman	Byrd	standing	right	behind	my	father.	The	water	pistol	means	he’ll stand	too	far	away.	Mimi	looks	at	me.	I	look	at	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowly,	Selectman	Byrd	comes	forward.	Ten	feet	away.	Eight	feet	away.	Five feet	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	he	fires. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	stream	of	syrup	hits	my	father	in	the	back	of	the	head	and	drips	down	his collar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Selectman	gets	a	nice	arc	in	the	stream	so	that	it	drops	down	on	him	like	a slow	shower. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	father	slowly	turns	to	face	him,	as	if	wondering	what’s	going	on.	The Selectman	hoses	him	in	the	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five	feet	away,	in	the	wrong	place.	And	there’s	nothing	Mimi	or	I	can	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	as	the	syrup	continues	to	stream	down	his	face,	my	father	reaches	under the	table.	He	has	two	cans	of	whipped	cream	taped	there.	He	stands	up.	He	aims them	both	at	the	Selectman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pay	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Selectman	pumps	up	his	water	gun	again	but	the	stream	stays	weak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	father	steps	backwards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Selectman	steps	forward.	Five	feet	from	where	my	father	had	been	sitting. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p164"></a>Three	feet.	One	foot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	press	the	button	on	the	device	in	my	pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	sends	a	radio	signal	to	the	devices	Mr.	Paul	installed	in	the	ceiling.	The	signal releases	magnets	that	were	holding	the	latches	closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	the	ceiling	comes	five	gallons	of	butterscotch	sauce,	the	only	thing	we could	think	of	that	was	stickier	than	maple	syrup. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Selectman	Byrd	is	stopped	in	his	tracks.	He	is	stunned.	He	stands	there,	his	arms at	his	sides,	as	the	butterscotch	sauce	trickles	down	his	head,	down	his	shirt,	into his	pants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Butterscotch	sauce	is	coming	out	of	the	cuffs	of	his	pants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	I	press	the	second	button. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Do	you	know	how	many	fake	yellow	feathers	there	are	in	two	pounds?	More than	enough	to	cover	an	entire	large	Selectman	who	has	been	recently	coated with	butterscotch	sauce. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Big	Byrd	stood	there	flapping	his	wings	as	if	he	were	really	Big	Bird. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	I	thought	to	myself:	For	a	waste	of	money,	it	was	worth	every	penny. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p165"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	20</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	found	it	both	annoying	and	typical	of	my	father	that	he	didn’t	run	a	photo	of	the Big	Birding	of	Selectman	Byrd	in	 <i class="calibre3">The	Gaz</i>.	He	said	that	he	didn’t	feel	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">“appropriate”	for	his	newspaper	to	run	a	picture	that	would	embarrass	someone, especially	since	it	might	be	seen	as	my	father	trying	to	get	back	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	guess	I	understand	that.	Even	so,	I	had	been	looking	forward	to	seeing	the photo	smack	dab	in	the	middle	of	the	front	page. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>	ran	it	on	the	front	page.	To	make	matters	worse,	the	caption	said	the newspaper	was	“investigating	the	mastermind	behind	the	stunt.”	I	guess	that would	be	me.	And	since	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>	was	also	investigating	The	Fordgythe Foundation,	I	must	have	been	#1	on	their	Most	Wanted	List,	although	they	of course	didn’t	know	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	there	was	the	lottery	debate.	It	was	coming	up	soon.	My	father	was	getting more	and	more	nervous	about	it.	He	had	been	collecting	information	for	months. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	he	was	muttering	to	himself	possible	questions	and	answers,	correcting himself	to	himself,	and	then	restating	the	answer	to	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	one	more	event	was	driving	my	father	crazy.	At	the	center	of	the	latest issue	of	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>	were	16	pages	of	ads,	all	from	the	Red	Mount	“You	Want It,	We	Got	It”	MultiStore.	And	on	every	page,	advertising	everything	from	tents to	French	pastry,	there	was	a	big,	colorful	coupon:	“Take	an	extra	10%	off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	the	type	of	ad	that	gets	people	to	buy	newspapers.	Or	so	said	my	father,	as he	muttered	and	sputtered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	fact,	my	kind,	gentle,	caring,	loving	father	had	actually	yelled	at	me.	He	never yelled,	much	less	over	something	like	leaving	my	breakfast	dishes	on	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	fact,	he	didn’t	really	yell	this	time,	if	by	“yell”	you	mean	“make	your	voice get	loud.”	But	he	said,	“Clear	your	dishes”	with	a	tone	that	wasn’t	kind,	gentle	or caring.	Sort	of	stern,	the	way	the	captain	of	a	ship	might	say,	“I	told	you	once before,	you	point	the	cannon	 <i class="calibre3">away</i>	from	the	ship.”	Something	like	that.	But,	in any	case,	it	wasn’t	like	my	father.	He	was	feeling	the	pressure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari,	Mimi	and	I	sat	in	my	room	and	played	a	video	game	that	I’d	bought	for	Ari and	he’d	thoughtfully	brought	with	him.	Both	he	and	Mimi	were	kicking	my</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a>butt.	I	might	as	well	have	been	playing	while	trying	to	get	into	my	good	sports jacket	which	was	two	sizes	too	small	and	completely	out	of	fashion	anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still,	the	only	time	I	ever	wore	it	was	to	Grown	Up	events	where	it	really	doesn’t matter	what	you	look	like	anyway.	Not	that	this	has	anything	to	do	with	how badly	I	was	playing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	can	we	do?”	asked	Ari,	adding	another	500	points	to	his	score. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About	the	advertising?	I	don’t	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hate	that	Red	Mount	store,”	Mimi	said.	“It’s	too	big.	If	you’re	in	sporting goods	and	remember	that	you	forgot	to	pick	up	toothpaste,	it’s	like	a	four	mile march	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	then	you	remember	that	you	forgot	pine	scented	room	deodorant,”	said Ari.	We	looked	at	him.	If	you’d	ever	been	in	Ari’s	room,	you’d	know	why	he was	looking	for	room	deodorizer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	could	pay	people	not	to	go	there,”	Mimi	said,	knowing	as	she	said	it	that	it wasn’t	a	very	good	idea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	could	phone	in	skunk	reports,”	Ari	said.	“You	know,	we	call	the	police	and tell	them	that	we’ve	seen	skunks	there.	They’d	clear	the	building	and…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ari,”	I	said,	“I	don’t	think	they	clear	buildings	when	someone	reports	a	skunk sighting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	they	ought	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari	was	now	approximately	a	bazillion	points	ahead	of	me	in	the	video	game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	could	offer	Red	Mount	the	same	deal	as	Mr.	Dunn	did	and	get	them	to advertise	in	 <i class="calibre3">The	Gaz</i>,”	Mimi	suggested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	dad	says	that	Red	Mount’s	contract	probably	says	they’ll	only	advertise	in <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	do	you	have	a	better	idea?”	Mimi	asked.	She	must	have	been	feeling	the pressure,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a>“No,	not	really.	I’d	just	rather	do	something	positive	to	get	more	people advertising	in	 <i class="calibre3">The	Gaz</i>	instead	of	skunking	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>,	if	you	know	what	I mean.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	you	said	skunking	wasn’t	a	good	idea,”	Ari	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	just	a	figure	of	speech.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	not	do	the	same	thing	for	some	other	store,”	Ari	said	as	the	video	game clanged	another	1,000	points	onto	his	score.	“You	know,	like	the	Game Dungeon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know,”	said	Mimi,	“that’s	not	such	a	bad	idea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,”	said	Ari,	“The	Game	Dungeon	is	such	a	great	store.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	not	just	for	the	Game	Dungeon,”	Mimi	continued.	“For	all	the	local	stores.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	of	them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	of	them	that	advertise	in	 <i class="calibre3">The	Gaz. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	like	it,”	I	said.	“It’s	positive	and	it’s	local.	But	I’m	not	sure	it’s	quite	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	not?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know.	I’m	just	not	sure	it’s	going	to	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	how	about	beating	the	10%	discount	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>	is	giving,”	Mimi	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Interesting,”	I	said,	“but	why	would	the	Fordgythe	Foundation	want	to	make	it cheaper	for	you	to	buy	asparagus	and	toilet	paper?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	they	make	such	a	delicious	salad	together?”	Mimi	suggested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	doing	the	last	of	my	homework	that	night	when	I	had	an	idea.	It	could work,	but	only	if	Ms.	Minden	helped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	to	see	her	after	school	on	Monday.	As	I	parked	my	bike	in	the	alley	beside the	bank	because	I	didn’t	want	people	to	notice	how	much	time	I	was	spending there,	I	thought	I	saw	someone	duck	out	of	the	way,	as	if	he	didn’t	want	me	to see	him.	Out	of	the	corner	of	my	eye,	I	saw	dark	pants,	white	sneakers,	and	what</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a>looked	like	antennae	coming	out	of	his	head.	It	must	have	been	my	imagination, I	told	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside,	Julia	took	me	into	a	private	office	and	I	told	her	our	plan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cool!”	she	said.	“But	it’s	going	to	be	a	little	tricky	to	arrange.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	I	know	what	to	do.	Just	leave	it	to	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	one	can	know	it’s	coming	from	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course.	The	money	is	going	to	come	from	the	Fordgythe	Foundation, naturally.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	should	happen	pretty	quickly.  <i class="calibre3">The	Gaz</i>	can’t	survive	too	long	if	it	doesn’t have	advertisers…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	understand.	Let	me	draw	up	a	plan	and	give	it	to	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	liked	the	sound	of	that.	Mimi,	Ari	and	I	hadn’t	drawn	up	plans.	We’d	just	had ideas	and	done	stuff.	Julia	was	really	working	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	I	was	feeling	better	when	I	came	home	that	afternoon.	But	that	didn’t	last long.	When	I	walked	in,	my	father	was	pacing	the	living	room	floor,	reading	out loud	from	some	pages	he’d	printed,	and	my	mother	was	sitting	in	a	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	mother	said,	“No,	no,	I	don’t	think	you	should	say	that	playing	the	lottery	is like	throwing	your	money	away,	because	to	the	people	who	play	the	lottery,	it doesn’t	feel	like	that	at	all.	They	think	they’re	buying	a	chance	to	win	millions	of dollars,	not	throwing	their	money	away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	they	have	no	chance	of	winning!”	my	father	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	they	do	have	a	chance.	A	tiny	chance,	but	a	chance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	it’s	not	a	chance	worth	spending	money	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	of	course	not.	But	the	people	who	play	the	lottery	think	they’re	buying	a small	chance	so	when	you	say	that	they’re	not	buying	any	chance,	they’re	going</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p169"></a>to	stop	listening	to	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	going	to	lie	to	them	and	tell	them	that	they’re	buying	something worthwhile	when	they	buy	a	lottery	ticket.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	not,”	my	mother	said	patiently.	“I’m	not	saying	you	should.	But you’re	telling	them	that	there’s	 <i class="calibre3">no</i>	chance	of	winning,	but	there	really	is	a chance,	it’s	just	a	tiny	tiny	tiny	chance.	You’re	not	talking	from	their	point	of view	and	so	they	won’t	listen	to	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	want	to	talk	from	their	point	of	view	because	their	point	of	view	is ridiculous,”	my	father	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	if	that’s	your	attitude	-	that	the	million	people	who	buy	a	lottery	ticket every	week	are	stupid	and	ridiculous	-	then	you’re	never	going	to	get	listened	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	don’t	have	to	agree	with	them	to	talk	to	them	from	their	point	of	view.	You know	that.	That’s	why	you’re	such	a	good	writer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	even	know	what	you’re	saying	any	more,”	my	father	said.	“You	want me	to	speak	from	their	point	of	view	but	not	speak	from	their	point	of	view,	and tell	them	they	have	a	chance	to	win	the	lottery	when	they	don’t…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	actually	haven’t	said	any	of	those	things,”	my	mother	said,	forcing	herself	to be	patient.	“But	I	think	maybe	this	isn’t	such	a	good	time	for	me	to	listen	to	what you	plan	on	saying.	Maybe	in	a	day	or	two.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine,	if	you	don’t	want	to	help	me…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	that’s	not	true.	Let’s	just	do	this	later.”	And	with	that,	my	mother	left the	living	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	dad	really	isn’t	the	jerk	who	was	practicing	for	the	debate.	It	was	as	if	an alien	jerk	had	invaded	his	body.	I	guess	nervousness	will	do	that	to	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	father	was	still	pacing,	scratching	at	the	printout	he	had	been	reading	from.	I went	upstairs	and	did	my	homework. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	morning,	as	I	rode	to	school,	I	noticed	Julia	in	her	car,	waving	to	me.	I pulled	up	next	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p170"></a>“Here	it	is,”	she	said,	handing	me	an	envelope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent!”	I	said,	tucking	it	carefully	it	into	my	backpack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	drove	away.	And	I	thought	I	saw	someone	with	antennae	coming	out	of	his head	duck	into	the	garage	across	the	street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	must	have	been	my	imagination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	of	course	it	wasn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p171"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	21</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	are	you	following	me?”	I	asked	the	space	alien	behind	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh?”	he	asked,	if	“Huh”	can	really	count	as	a	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	been	following	me.	I	want	to	know	why.”	I	sounded	brave	but	my	knees were	weak.	Fortunately,	it	was	a	sunny	day	on	a	busy	street	or	I	wouldn’t	have had	the	nerve	to	confront	the	guy	with	the	antennas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	course,	it	helped	that	he	was	no	alien.	The	antennas	were	pencils,	one	behind each	ear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	haven’t	been	following	you,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	how	come	every	time	I	turn	around,	I	see	you	scurrying	out	of	the	way?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	scurrying…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aha!	Then	you	admit	that	you’ve	been	following	me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	How	do	you	get	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	you	said	you	weren’t	scurrying,	but	didn’t	deny	that	you	were following	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	because	you	cut	me	off	with	your	‘Aha!’	If	you’d	let	me	finish,	I	would have	denied	the	whole	thing.”	He	looked	like	he’d	just	graduated	high	school.	In fact,	I	thought	I	recognized	him	from	around	town. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	you	deny	that	you’ve	been	following	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	that’s	what	I’ve	been	denying	for	the	past	ten	minutes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?”	I	was	beginning	to	feel	pretty	stupid.	“Because	I	was	pretty	sure	it	was you	that’s	been	following	me.	Someone	has	been.	At	least	I	think	so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	well,	it	was	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p172"></a>“Really?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	why	were	you	denying	it	before?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wouldn’t	you?	I	mean,	that’s	part	of	following	someone	around.	When	they catch	you,	you	deny	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you’re	admitting	it	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,”	he	said,	pulling	one	of	the	pencils	from	behind	his	ear.	“I	mean,	you’ve caught	me	at	it.	I’m	not	going	to	be	able	to	follow	you	any	more.	So,	I	might	as well	admit	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow!	I	really	did	catch	you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	he	said,	“But	it’s	a	little	embarrassing.	Would	you	mind	not	telling anyone	you	caught	me	at	it?	After	all,	I	admitted	it	when	I	could	have	kept	on denying	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I	guess	that’s	fair.	But	you	have	to	tell	me	why	you’re	following	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure.	I	was	going	to	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	waited.	I	was	holding	my	bike	up.	We	were	about	a	block	from	the	bank.	“So?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ok,”	he	said,	pulling	a	pad	from	his	back	pocket.	“I	work	for	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!”	I	didn’t	like	where	this	was	going. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually	I	work	for	Mr.	Dunn.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	getting	worse.	“What’s	he	interested	in	me	for?”	Because	my	father owned	the	town’s	other	newspaper?	Because	Mr.	Dunn	had	figured	out	that	I was	the	Fordgythe	Institute?	Because	he	knew	I	had	$100,000,000	in	the	bank? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	you	did	something	funny	with	the	Terwilliger	Spoon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	so	relieved	that	I	practically	laughed	in	his	face.	“Who	are	you?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p173"></a>“Matt	Jerkowicz.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	I	knew	how	I	knew	him.	He	was	on	the	football	team	last	year.	I	didn’t	care about	football,	but	you	don’t	forget	a	guy	who’s	named	“Jerkowicz.”	I	had	felt sorry	for	him	from	the	moment	I’d	first	heard	his	name.	“Hi,	Matt.	I’m	Jake.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	yeah,	of	course.	So,	this	is	about	the	Terwilliger	Spoon?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.	Old	man	Mr.	Dunn	thinks	you	had	something	to	do	with	it	going	missing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	asked	me	to	check	up	on	you.”	He	held	his	pencil	on	a	blank	sheet	on	his pad,	ready	to	record	whatever	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	found	the	spoon.	We	were	doing	a	favor	for	Amanda.	And	now	her	father treats	me	like	a	criminal?	That’s	nice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	all	very	confused	about	what	went	on	with	that	spoon.	It	was	gone.	It was	back.	It	was	back	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	I	can	see	that	that’s	pretty	confusing.	But	I’ve	got	nothing	else	to	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Besides,	I	have	to	go	do	my	chores.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Matt	closed	his	notebook.	“Ok,	well,	thanks.	I’ll	tell	Mr.	Dunn	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	done	following	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	I	guess	so.	No	offense.”	He	started	to	turn	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	Matt,”	I	called.	“Do	you	have	a	minute?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	didn’t	take	more	than	a	sundae	at	The	Soda	Squirt	to	find	out	a	few	interesting facts	from	Matt.	First,	Mr.	Dunn	was	constantly	making	phone	calls	to	the	editor of	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>.	Every	little	detail	had	to	be	approved	by	Mr.	Dunn.	And	then there	were	all	the	bad	ideas	he	came	up	with	that	the	editor	would	have	to	find	a way	to	ignore.	Matt’s	favorite	was	Mr.	Dunn’s	brilliant	idea	that	the	paper	ought to	highlight	in	yellow	the	key	phrases	in	each	article	so	readers	could	skim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	editor	had	argued	that	that	they	might	as	well	just	reduce	each	article to	three	or	four	sentences,	Mr.	Dunn	had	actually	thought	it	was	a	good	idea. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p174"></a>I	also	learned	that	Mr.	Dunn	was	obsessed	with	the	upcoming	debate.	He	had most	of	the	staff	of	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>	researching	his	side	of	the	argument.	In	fact, Matt	said	that	Mr.	Dunn	was	even	thinking	that	he	might	run	for	governor	if	this debate	went	well.	He	had	hired	a	professional	media	coach,	someone	who teaches	you	how	to	be	effective	on	television.	Worst,	Mr.	Dunn	had	a	full-size photograph	of	my	father	in	his	office,	and	of	course	it	was	a	photo	of	him	from the	Pancake	Breakfast	with	the	syrup	running	into	his	collar.	Mr.	Dunn	was practicing	his	debating	techniques	looking	straight	into	the	photograph’s	eyes.	“I will	destroy	him,”	he	said	whenever	anyone	came	into	his	office.	“Destroy	him!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	father	didn’t	have	that	kind	of	focus.	Or	obsession. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	scary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	not	as	scary	as	the	thought	that	if	I	had	had	time	recently	to	drop	off	stacks of	cash	from	the	Fordgythe	Foundation,	Matt	would	have	found	me	out.	But things	had	been	pretty	hectic	what	with	school	ending	and	the	debate	coming	up, so	it	had	been	a	week	since	my	last	donation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	now	that	Matt	wouldn’t	be	following	me,	I	could	saddle	up	my	bike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	eight	high	school	seniors	who	I	knew	were	going	to	have	trouble affording	college.	They	each	got	$10,000,	neatly	tied	with	my	mother’s	pretty yarn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	local	hospital	got	$20,000	to	refurnish	the	entire	maternity	ward.	I’d	read	in <i class="calibre3">The	Gaz</i>	that	they	didn’t	even	have	enough	beds	for	moms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Grubach,	who	had	been	teaching	art	at	our	school	for	the	past	hundred	years, was	retiring.	He	was	the	only	person	who	could	tell	what	my	drawings	were supposed	to	look	like.	Everyone	else	would	ask	me	if	I	was	drawing	a	rumpled bed	or	a	pile	of	leaves,	but	Mr.	Grubach	would	come	up	to	me	and	say:	“Nice horse,	Jake.”	The	Fordgythe	Foundation	gave	him	$10,000	for	a	trip	to	Italy	and France	to	see	those	artworks	he	was	always	telling	us	about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	careful	making	the	deliveries.	I	was	sure	nobody	with	antennas	coming	out of	his	head	was	watching	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	father	was	practicing	again	when	I	came	back.	He	had	piles	of	papers	in front	of	him	and	was	scribbling	notes	on	yellow	pads	of	paper.	Unlike	Mr.	Dunn, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p175"></a>he	wasn’t	having	his	employees	come	up	with	good	one-liners	and	clever	ways of	making	my	father	look	bad.	But	my	father	believed	that	the	truth	always	wins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	why	he’s	a	journalist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	guess	I	don’t	believe	that	the	truth	always	wins.	Well-told	lies	win	all	too	often. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	why	we	have	commercials. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wished	there	was	something	I	could	do	for	my	father.	He	was	more	convinced than	I	was	that	the	lottery	was	a	bad	idea.	Just	because	the	lottery	made	me	rich didn’t	mean	that	the	state	ought	to	have	a	lottery	in	the	first	place.	I	was	just lucky.	Still,	I	didn’t	think	a	lottery	was	such	a	terrible	thing.	If	I	had	to	vote,	I’d vote	against	having	one	because	I	think	my	father’s	reasoning	is	right.	But	I didn’t	think	it	was	as	big	a	deal	as	he	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless,	I	sure	wanted	my	dad	to	win.	In	fact,	I’ll	do	what	my	father	would do:	List	the	reasons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First,	I	thought	he	was	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Second,	I	didn’t	like	Mr.	Dunn,	even	though	he	had	been	nice	to	Ari. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Third,	I	didn’t	want	Mr.	Dunn	to	be	able	to	use	winning	the	debate	to	help	him become	governor	of	the	state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fourth,	Dad’s	my	father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	could	take	away	reasons	1-3	and	#4	would	have	been	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	couldn’t	figure	out	anything	I	could	do	to	help	him.	So,	I	asked	my	mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	very	nice	of	you,	Jake,”	she	said,	“But	I	think	he	has	to	do	this	on	his own.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	heard	you	helping	him	rehearse	the	other	night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	well,	that	didn’t	go	too	well.	He’s	so	nervous	about	this	that	he	won’t	listen to	criticism…I	mean	the	sort	of	helpful	criticism	that	would	help	him	do	better.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	I	could	tell,”	I	said.	“Maybe	he’d	rehearse	better	with	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p176"></a>“Well,	you	can	try,	but	I	wouldn’t	count	on	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	didn’t	go	for	it.	He	didn’t	want	anyone	helping	him	rehearse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	did	have	one	idea,	though.	It	meant	placing	a	call	to	Ms.	Minden.	Julia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sounds	great,”	Julia	said.	“I’ll	get	to	work	on	it	right	away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	Friday,	Ari	and	I	made	a	trip	into	the	city.	Video	games	were	turning	out	to be	the	one	treat	I	could	buy	for	myself	without	arousing	anyone’s	suspicion, because	I	kept	them	at	Ari’s	whose	house	was	such	a	mess	that	his	parents	would never	notice	the	sudden	increase	in	the	number	of	video	games	in	his	room.	But we	were	afraid	that	the	creepy	guy	who	runs	the	Game	Dungeon	in	town	would start	wondering	how	we	could	afford	to	buy	every	new	game	that	came	out.	So, after	school	we	hopped	onto	the	train	to	find	a	game	store	in	the	city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	good	to	spend	some	time	with	Ari	alone.	I’d	been	hanging	out	more	with Mimi	for	the	past	few	weeks,	not	quite	on	purpose	but	not	quite	by	accident either.	Ari	could	be	sort	of	annoying	even	if	he	was	one	of	my	two	best	friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	something	amazing	happened	on	the	train	ride	back:	Ari	was	normal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	car	was	crowded	with	commuters	leaving	work	a	little	early	on	Friday afternoon.	We	found	two	seats	facing	each	other	and	were	about	to	sit	when Halley	came	down	the	aisle.	I	hadn’t	seen	her	since	the	day	we	spent	at	the	old age	center.	Ari	and	I	both	like	Halley	a	lot.	She’s	always	friendly	and	almost always	cheerful.	I	said	hello,	but	Ari	stood	up	from	his	seat	and	offered	it	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	didn’t	even	seem	to	have	thought	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now,	this	might	sound	like	plain	old	sexism:	the	gallant	young	knight	offering the	damsel	his	seat.	But	it	wasn’t.	Halley	has	a	problem	with	her	spine	and	has difficulty	standing	for	more	than	a	few	minutes.	That’s	why	Amanda’s	handing her	stuff	for	Halley	to	carry	at	the	Senior	Center	was	especially	thoughtless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway,	by	offering	Halley	his	seat,	Ari	was	simply	doing	the	right	thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stood	for	the	entire	trip	-	I	offered	to	swap	positions	with	him	halfway through,	but	he	refused	-	having	a	conversation	with	Halley	that	wasn’t awkward,	self-centered	or	dumb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	little	Ari	was	growing	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p177"></a>When	we	got	to	his	house	with	our	bundle	of	video	games,	I	asked	him	straight out:	“Ari,	how	come	you	weren’t	a	dork	with	Halley?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	would	I	be	a	dork?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	you	always	are.	You	get	nervous,	you	say	completely	obvious	things, you	ride	your	bike	into	the	bushes…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ok	ok,”	he	said,	embarrassed.	“I	used	to	do	that.	And	it	was	a	pretty	good technique.	It	really	worked.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Worked?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	shy,”	he	explained,	popping	a	new	game	into	the	console.	“Maybe	you’ve noticed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Once	or	twice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	make	friends	easily.	That’s	why	you’re	like	my	only	friend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	Mimi…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	more	your	friend	than	my	friend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	not	true.”	I	knew	that	it	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you	weren’t	my	friend,	she’d	never	have	starting	be	friends	with	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	not	true.”	I	knew	that	it	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	being	a	dork	gave	me	a	reason	why	I	have	trouble	with	people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?	I	thought	being	a	dork	was	why	you	have	trouble	with	people.”	I	know it	sounds	like	we	were	saying	the	same	thing,	but	we	understood	that	we	weren’t: Dorkiness	was	Ari’s	solution	to	his	problem	with	people,	not	the	cause	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	how	did	this	come	about?”	I	asked.	“Did	you	just	wake	up	one	day	and	say:</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	am	not	a	dork’?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually,	it	was	sort	of	like	that.	Let	me	tell	you…” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p178"></a>It	seems	that	for	the	past	130	years,	Ari	had	had	a	crush	on	Mimi.	(That	covers his	entire	life	plus	several	past	lives.)	Even	when	he	was	chasing	Amanda,	his heart	still	belonged	to	Mimi.	I	was	a	dope	not	to	see	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	last	week,	while	walking	home	from	school	with	Mimi,	he	wondered	why	he was	able	to	talk	comfortably	with	her	whereas	when	he	saw	Amanda,	he	pretty much	just	leaped	into	whatever	solid	object	was	nearby.	But	that’s	not	what	he asked	Mimi.	Instead	he	said:	“I	haven’t	seen	much	of	you	and	Jake	recently.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“End	of	school.	Busy.	You	know.”	Ari	knew	Mimi	was	lying.	Mimi	and	I	had definitely	been	avoiding	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari	decided	that	it	was	time	to	let	Mimi	know	how	he	felt.	So,	he	went	home	and did	the	most	dorkish	thing	he	could	think	of.	Of	course,	he	didn’t	think	it	was dorkish.	It	just	naturally	was.	He	baked	her	a	giant	cookie	in	the	shape	of	a	heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And,	being	Ari,	he	decided	that	if	one	recipe	was	good,	two	recipes	would	be even	better,	so	he	picked	the	best	ingredients	from	his	mother’s	chocolate	chip cookies	and	her	peanut	butter	oatmeal	cookies.	And,	what	the	heck,	he	dumped in	the	best	ingredients	in	cheesecake	because	everyone	likes	cheesecake.	Then he	spelled	out	“Mimi	Your	Special”	in	licorice	candies.	(Too	bad	his	cake	didn’t come	with	a	spellchecker.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">He	baked	it.	He	cut	off	the	burned	parts.	He	ate	most	of	the	burned	parts.	He	put it	in	a	pizza	box	that	had	only	a	few	large	grease	stains	in	it.	He	carried	it	to Mimi’s	house	and	left	it	on	her	stoop.	Where	the	sprinkler	soaked	it.	And squirrels	ran	across	it.	And	Mimi	slipped	on	it	when	she	came	out	the	door.	Bam, off	her	stoop	and	down	on	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	from	me,”	Ari	said	as	he	helped	Mimi	up.	Her	face	went	from scrunched-up	annoyance	to	wide-open	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimi	being	Mimi	said,	“Oh,	that’s	so	nice	of	you,	Ari”	even	before	she	opened the	box. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cookie	inside	had	crumbled.	The	licorice	pieces	were	now	in	a	code	that	no human	would	ever	decipher.	“Well,	it’s	the	thought,”	she	said	as	she	carefully didn’t	eat	any	of	the	sopping	wet,	squished,	squirrel-nibbled	cookie.	She	smiled at	him.	“What	 <i class="calibre3">was</i>	the	thought,	anyway?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari	knew	he	was	not	going	to	be	able	to	get	the	words	out.	After	all,	that’s	why</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p179"></a>he	baked	the	cookie.	The	cookie	would	do	the	speaking	for	him.	Except	the cookie	not	only	had	no	words	on	it	any	more,	it	had	attacked	Mimi.	Without	his cookie	to	tell	Mimi	how	he	felt,	he	knew	he	would	stand	there,	stammer something	stupid,	and	then	run	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead,	he	said,	“I’ve	always	liked	you,	Mimi.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me,	too,	Ari.	That’s	nice	of	you	to	say.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	what	I	mean,	though,	don’t	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimi	looked	at	him.	At	first	she	smiled	as	if	she	were	about	to	make	a	joke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	she	thought	about	what	it	meant	to	have	him	say	such	words	to	her.	Her smile	deepened.	“Yes,	Ari,	I	do.	I’ve	known	for	a	long	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you	never	said	anything,”	Ari	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Neither	did	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	do	you	like	me?	I	mean	the	way	I	like	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	Mimi	said.	“It	was	easier	avoiding	that	question	when	you	were being	the	dopey	guy	you	usually	are.	You	know,	the	guy	who	leaves	a	pizza	on my	front	step	so	that	I	slip	on	it	and	scrape	my	calf.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	actually	a	cookie	that	said	‘You’re	Special.’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aw,	that’s	sweet.	But	it’s	a	lot	harder	answering	the	question	to	the	Ari	who’s speaking	to	me	like	a	real	human	being	about	what	he	feels.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	ok.	You	don’t	have	to	answer,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	want	to.	I	just	don’t	know.	I	feel	like	I	have	to	get	to	know	this	Ari.”	Mimi	has a	wonderful	smile,	you	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	they	went	through	the	gate	to	the	sidewalk,	Mimi	asked	Ari	the	obvious question:	“What	happened	to	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	smiled	at	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	awfully	romantic,	but…” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p180"></a>“No,”	he	said,	“I	don’t	mean	that	you	smiled	and	suddenly	the	roses	bloomed and	the	rain	stopped.	I	mean	I	tripped	you	on	your	steps,	but	as	soon	as	you realized	that	it	was	me,	you	smiled.	And,	I	don’t	know,	I	felt	like	I	had	always been	two	people	but	hadn’t	known	it.	One	person	is	the	awkward,	geeky	Ari	who can	never	say	the	right	thing,	the	one	who	would	bake	you	a	cookie	because	he knows	he	won’t	be	able	to	say	what	he	wants	to	say.	The	other	person	is	the person	you’ve	known	all	your	life.	And	that’s	the	one	you	smiled	at.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	really	cool.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.	The	thing	is,	though,	that	I	think	I’m	probably	still	a	dork.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Probably,”	Mimi	said	as	she	kissed	him	on	the	cheek	in	a	way	that	Ari	spent	the next	three	days	trying	to	figure	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari	was	just	finishing	telling	me	this	when	I	heard	my	father	come	in.	Since	I didn’t	know	what	to	say	either	-	Mimi	and	Ari	seemed	like	a	pretty	unlikely match,	even	if	this	was	a	New	and	Not-So-Dorky	Ari	-	I	went	downstairs	and greeted	him.	He	was	carrying	a	copy	of	the	latest	 <i class="calibre3">The	Gaz</i>.	I	took	it	upstairs where	Ari	and	I	found	three	interesting	things	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First,	just	about	all	the	local	advertisers	had	a	coupon	promising	that	for everything	you	bought	there,	the	Fordgythe	Foundation	would	donate	10%	to	a local	charity,	up	to	a	total	of	a	million	dollars.	You	didn’t	get	a	discount,	but	you knew	that	you	were	helping	someone	else.	I	thought	lots	of	people	would	prefer that	to	 <i class="calibre3">the	Register’s</i>	offer.	Julia	had	done	a	great	job	getting	the	advertisers	to agree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Second,	the	lead	story	on	the	front	page	was	headlined	“Who	Is	Fordgythe?”	The story	listed	about	half	of	the	donations	we	had	made.	Although	it	didn’t	get	very far	in	pinpointing	who	was	behind	the	foundation,	it	did	point	out	that	the foundation	wasn’t	legally	registered	in	the	state,	or	in	any	other	state	for	that matter.	No	street	address,	no	names	listed,	no	web	page.	It	made	the	Fordgythe Foundation	sound	fishy,	although	the	article	pointed	out	that	all	the	donations	it could	find	were	to	good	causes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Third,	my	father’s	editorial	this	week	was	about	why	we	should	be	careful	about accepting	money	from	a	foundation	about	which	we	know	nothing.	It	could	be embarrassing.	In	fact,	the	editorial	said	that	 <i class="calibre3">The	Gaz</i>	would	no	longer	accept	ads that	feature	coupons	from	the	Fordgythe	Foundation.	My	father	apologized	for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p181"></a>letting	them	go	into	this	issue.	“Our	guess	is	that	there	is	a	single	person	behind this	Foundation,”	the	editorial	said.	“Its	pattern	of	donations	and	its	way	of behaving	are	too	quirky	for	a	Foundation	run	by	a	committee.	If	so,	and	if	the Fordgythe	Foundation	really	has	the	best	interests	of	our	town	at	heart,”	the editorial	concluded,	“let	it	uncloak	itself	to	remove	the	suspicion	that	its	secrecy is	motivated	by	shame	and	its	donations	are	motivated	by	guilt.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ulp.	Dad	was	coming	after	me	pretty	hard.	And	he	didn’t	even	know	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p182"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	22</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">While	 <i class="calibre3">The	Gaz</i>	carefully	laid	out	what	was	known	about	the	Fordgythe Foundation,  <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>	spouted	rumors	and	assumptions	as	if	it	were	a	whale with	a	size	XL	blow	hole.	If	you	were	to	believe	the	article	on	its	front	page,	the Fordgythe	Foundation	was	a	plot	by	outsiders	to	undermine	the	moral	fabric	of our	town,	its	money	very	likely	came	from	drug	lords	trying	to	“launder”	their cash	so	the	tax	people	couldn’t	trace	it,	and	it	was	out	personally	to	sink	 <i class="calibre3">The</i> <i class="calibre3">Register</i>	by	pretending	to	give	money	to	charities	for	purchases	made	at	local stores. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	interesting	of	all	to	me	were	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>‘s	clear	hints	that	it	was	on	the verge	of	exposing	who	was	behind	the	Foundation.	Since	I	knew	that	I	wasn’t	a drug	lord	laundering	cash,	I	also	knew	that	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>	wasn’t	truly	close	to figuring	it	out.	The	one	thing	they’d	gotten	right,	though,	was	that	the Foundation	was	trying	to	sink	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>,	if	by	“sink”	you	mean	“keep	 <i class="calibre3">The</i> <i class="calibre3">Register</i>	from	sinking	 <i class="calibre3">The	Gaz</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here’s	the	thing	my	father	figured	out	that	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>	didn’t.	My	father understood,	based	on	nothing	but	intuition,	that	the	Fordgythe	Foundation	was personal.	It	may	have	the	word	“foundation”	in	its	title,	but	it’s	really	about	one person	-	and	his	two	friends	-	helping	out	other	individuals.  <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i> assumed	it	was	a	heartless	organization	giving	cash	to	other	nameless individuals.	People	so	often	see	their	own	reflections	when	they	look	at	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	why	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>	missed	the	point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	only	a	week	until	the	debate,	and	I	knew	my	family	life	was	going	to be	busy	and	tense.	But	I	decided	it’d	be	worth	it	to	try	to	throw	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	want	 <i class="calibre3">The	Gaz</i>	to	find	out	who	was	behind	The	Foundation,	but	I definitely	wanted	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>	to	be	very	wrong	in	public	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile,	another	of	my	plans	was	about	to	kick	in.	This	one	was	only	a	little bit	sneaky,	though.	I	had	asked	Julia,	my	employee,	to	find	someone	who	could help	my	father	do	better	in	the	debate.	She	had	done	some	research	and	found	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">“media	consultant”	named	Mischa	Buskin,	who	claimed	to	have	worked	with	the biggest	stars,	politicians	and	heads	of	companies,	teaching	them	how	to	come across	well	on	TV.	Julia	sent	me	the	Web	address	for	Mischa’s	company,	which was	called	TeleSuccess,	Inc.	The	site	said	that	the	company	would	teach	you</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p183"></a>how	to	hold	your	hands	while	on	camera,	how	often	to	smile,	and	“The	Seven Gestures	of	Success.”	Sounded	pretty	dumb	to	me,	but	if	you’ve	ever	seen someone	interviewed	on	TV	who	didn’t	know	where	to	look	or	how	to	hold	his hands,	you	realize	that	there	are	some	simple,	dumb	things	that	make	a	big difference. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	my	father	got	a	fat,	glossy	package	from	TeleSuccess,	Inc.	sent	to	him	by The	Fordgythe	Foundation.	Because	of	the	Foundation’s	interest	in	eliminating state	lotteries,	the	letter	said,	it	was	paying	for	a	three	hour	session	with	Mischa Buskin.	Further,	because	the	Foundation	understood	how	busy	my	father	is	and how	soon	the	debate	is	to	be	held,	rather	than	requiring	my	father	to	fly	out	to Los	Angeles,	they	were	flying	Mr.	Buskin	in.	He	could	be	there	any	day	of	the week.	The	letter	ended	by	saying	that	a	representative	of	the	Foundation	would call	immediately	to	set	up	the	visit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because	the	envelope	was	from	the	Foundation,	it	was	the	first	one	in	the	daily pile	my	father	opened	when	he	came	home	on	Monday	night.	He	read	it	once, shook	his	head	in	disbelief,	and	then	read	it	again.	“I’ll	be,”	he	said,	not	telling us	what	he	would	be.	“I’ll	be.	What	sort	of	Foundation	is	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	it,	Dad?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Fordgythe	Foundation	is	trying	to	bribe	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	I	said	in	genuine	surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	trying	to	bribe	me,”	he	explained	completely	unhelpfully,	waving	the paper	in	my	face.	“They’re	offering	to	fly	some	bogus	media	consultant	out	here to	teach	me	how	to	fake	being	sincere.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take	a	look,”	he	said,	handing	me	the	packet.	I	read	again	the	letter	that	Ms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Minden	had	written;	I’d	read	it	two	nights	before.	“It	doesn’t	sound	like	a	bribe to	me,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	bribe	doesn’t	have	to	be	money.	If	you	get	out	of	a	speeding	ticket	by offering	to	wash	the	cop’s	car,	that’s	still	a	bribe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would	that	work?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p184"></a>“Of	course	not!	But	that’s	not	the	point.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know,”	I	said.	“But	I	don’t	read	this	as	a	bribe	at	all.	They’re	not	trying	to	get you	to	change	your	opinion	about	lotteries.	They’re	trying	to	help	you	do	better.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	but…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	interrupted	my	own	father.	“If	they	said	we’ll	give	you	media	training	or	wash your	car	or	leave	$5,000	in	your	mailbox	if	you	come	out	 <i class="calibre3">against</i>	the	lottery,	or if	you’d	do	badly	in	the	debate	on	purpose…_that’d_	be	a	bribe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“May	I	get	a	word	in	edgewise?”	my	father	asked.	“I	agree	that	it’s	not	your standard	sort	of	bribe.	Nevertheless,	as	I’m	exposing	the	Fordgythe	Foundation in	the	paper,	if	it	were	to	get	out	that	I’d	accepted	money	expensive	media training	from	them,	it’d	look	very	very	bad.	Journalists	can’t	do	that	sort	of thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,	Dad…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	a	matter	of	Journalistic	Ethics.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	could	practically	hear	him	capitalize	the	phrase	“Journalistic	Ethics.”	Those capitals	meant	the	conversation	was	over.	But	this	time	I	wasn’t	giving	up.	“But, Dad,	you	know	how	you	just	said,	‘May	I	get	a	word	in	edgewise?’	when	I	had only	talked	for	about	a	minute?	That’s	exactly	the	type	of	little	thing	that	puts people	off.	It’s	what	you	need	media	training	for.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gee,”	said	my	father,	“you	seem	to	know	an	awful	lot	about	media	training	all of	a	sudden.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	right,”	my	mother	said,	entering	the	room.	She’d	been	listening	from	the den.	“I’m	sure	there	are	a	hundred	little	ways	anyone’s	presentation	skills	could be	improved.	Something	like	‘May	I	get	a	word	in	edgewise?’	is	the	type	of	little thing	that	can	prevent	an	audience	from	hearing	what	you’re	actually	saying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	that’s	the	point.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	going	to	be	myself	on	TV…”	my	father	insisted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	one	is	saying	you	shouldn’t	be,”	my	mother	said,	sweetly.	“That’s	what	we all	want.	But	how	much	of	an	expert	are	you	on	how	to	present	ideas	on	TV?	A</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p185"></a>big	expert	or	just	a	pretty	big	expert?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	an…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	you’re	not	an	expert	at	all.	But	I	promise	you	that	Mr.	Dunn	has	been through	the	training.	He’s	an	expert.	And	that	means	it’s	going	to	be	easier	for the	audience	to	agree	with	him	than	it	will	be	to	agree	with	you.	I	think	you ought	to	take	the	Foundation	up	on	the	offer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Out	of	the	question.	I	simply	cannot	accept	gifts	of	any	kind	from	an organization	I’m	investigating.	And	I	will	not	become	something	I’m	not	on	TV</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	because	some	media	expert	thinks	he	knows	what	type	of	phoniness	looks really	sincere.	That’s	all	there	is	to	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	that	was	all	there	was	to	it.	I	emailed	Ms.	Minden	and	told	her	to	tell Mischa	not	to	bother	packing	his	bags.	He	charged	us	“only”	$2,000	for reserving	the	time	to	see	my	father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	dinner,	I	had	an	idea	about	how	to	throw	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>	off	the	scent.	I called	Ms.	Minden	again	and	asked	if	she	could	meet	me	at	the	Soda	Squirt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,	boss,”	she	replied.	Wow.	I	was	a	boss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	there	right	on	time.	“What’s	up,	boss?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Could	you	stop	calling	me	‘boss’?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure	thing	…	boss.	Ok,	I’ll	stop.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you	are	my	boss,	you	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ok,	ok,	and	you’re	my	slave.	But	can	we	just	keep	it	down?”	There	was	no	one else	in	the	restaurant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ok.	How	can	I	help	you,	oh	my	little	captain?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Suppose	the	money	for	the	Foundation	were	coming	from	Germany,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would	there	be	any	receipts	or	forms	or	anything	that	would	show	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p186"></a>“Yes,	sure.	Depending	on	how	the	money	was	transferred	from	Germany	to	here, there	might	be	a	few	different	types	of	forms	that	get	filed.	Why	do	you	ask?	Are you	thinking	of	moving	your	money	to	Germany?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I’m	thinking	about	ways	to	give	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>	the	entirely	wrong	idea	about who’s	behind	the	Fordgythe	Foundation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aha!”	Ms.	Minden	said	happily.	“You	want	to	get	one	of	those	forms,	don’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	But	not	an	entire	form.	I	just	want	to	include	a	scrap,	as	if	by	accident.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	not	enough	for	him	to	be	able	to	trace	it	back	to	a	particular	bank	in Germany	because	he’d	find	out	that	there	is	no	bank	account	there	for	the Fordgythe	Foundation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	what	I	was	thinking,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	it’s	a	darn	good	thought.	That	shouldn’t	be	a	problem.	I	can	photocopy	a real	one	from	a	different	account	and	tear	it	so	that	he	can	see	that	it	came	from Germany	but	not	see	which	bank	or	which	account.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	sounds	perfect,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	best	of	all,	it’s	not	even	illegal!	I	like	working	for	you,	but	I’m	not	willing to	go	to	jail	for	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘No	lies,	no	actual	crimes.’	That	should	be	the	motto	of	the	Fordgythe Foundation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	do	this	tomorrow.	It’ll	be	fun!”	Ms.	Minden	slid	out	of	the	booth	and	out the	door,	smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	paid	for	her	coffee.	I	was,	after	all,	her	boss. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p187"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	23</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	the	Friday	before	the	debate	on	Sunday	and	my	family	was	a	mess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	father	was,	of	course,	more	stressed	than	I’d	ever	seen.	He	wanted	to	do	well in	this	debate	because	he	cared	about	the	issue.	And	this	debate	was	his	big audition.	If	he	did	well,	he	might	get	to	do	this	regularly.	I	could	see	why	that would	be	fun,	but	I	had	had	no	idea	that	my	father	thought	it	would	be	fun,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stress	is	a	communicable	disease	like	measles.	You	can	catch	it	from	others, particularly	from	people	you’re	close	to.	My	father	was	not	being	particularly nice	that	week.	He	snapped	at	my	mother	when	she	didn’t	deserve	it.	Well,	not that	she	ever	deserves	it.	He	wasn’t	doing	his	chores	because	he	was	so	focused on	preparing.	He	was	just	a	big	bundle	of	nerves	and	no	fun	to	live	with. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	that	was	just	the	beginning	for	my	mother.	She	was	preparing	to	teach	a couple	of	courses	and	was	supposed	to	be	sending	in	the	list	of	books	her students	would	be	buying	in	the	fall.	That	meant	designing	the	courses,	both	of which	were	new	ones	for	her.	So,	with	a	deadline	coming	up,	she	was	reading through	big	stacks	of	books,	trying	to	figure	out	what	she’d	be	teaching	week	by week. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	if	that	weren’t	enough,	Maddie	picked	this	week	to	come	home	from	pre-school	with	head	lice.	Same	as	last	year.	At	first	you	think	having	lice	is disgusting,	and	you’re	right.	Then	you	think	it’s	embarrassing,	which	it	also	is. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	if	you’ve	been	through	having	lice	once	before,	mainly	you	think	it	is	just	a major	pain	in	the	butt.	My	mother	had	to	run	everything	through	the	washer	and dryer.	And	then	we	all	had	to	undergo	The	Treatment.	(There’s	a	reason	why	the world’s	great	supermodels	don’t	wash	their	hair	with	lice	shampoo.)	And	then, twice	a	day,	my	mother	had	to	pick	through	Maddie’s	long	hair,	looking	for	the tiny	eggs	lice	leave	attached	to	strands	of	hair.	And,	Maddie	had	a	cold	so	it	was hard	to	get	her	to	sit	still	long	enough	to	do	a	thorough	job	of	it.	Maddie	would squirm,	my	mother	would	get	annoyed,	Maddie	would	cry,	my	mother	would	try not	to	yell…</p>
<p class="calibre1">I,	of	course,	was	a	rock.	I	was	calm,	always	cheerful,	helpful	and	just	a	delight	to be	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p188"></a>Yeah,	sure.	I	was	worried	that	one	of	the	newspapers	would	figure	out	who	was behind	the	Foundation.	I	was	worried	what	that	would	do	to	my	father	in	the debate.	I	was	worried	Mr.	Dunn	would	be	better	trained	than	my	dad.	I	was worried	that	if	I	were	found	out,	I	had	dug	such	a	deep	hole	for	myself	that	my parents	would	never	speak	to	me	again.	I	hadn’t	lied	to	them,	not	even	once,	but I	sure	had	gone	out	of	my	way	to	keep	my	$100,000,000	secret	from	them.	At some	point,	keeping	a	secret	begins	to	feel	a	lot	like	lying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	when	my	father	came	on	Friday	with	copies	of	 <i class="calibre3">The	Gaz</i>	and	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>,	it took	all	of	my	self-control	not	to	rip	the	copies	out	of	his	hands.	I	made	myself walk	upstairs	one	step	at	a	time	to	read	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The	Gaz</i>	had	an	article	about	the	Fordgythe	Foundation	on	page	five,	right	next to	an	article	about	how	the	high	school’s	football	field	was	being	re-seeded.	It reported	on	some	of	our	recent	donations	but	had	no	more	news	about	who	was behind	the	Foundation.	“Our	investigation	is	continuing,”	was	all	it	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>	had	us	all	over	the	front	page.	There	was	a	photo	of	Arnie	Junger holding	the	bills	I’d	given	him	for	his	college	education.	“Local	youth	says	he was	surprised	by	the	$10,000	he	found	in	his	mailbox.”	Well,	wouldn’t	you	be? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	headline	of	the	lead	article	screamed:	“The	Fordgythe-Germany Connection!  <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>	Cracks	the	Case!”	It	began: As	the	result	of	an	extensive	investigation	by	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>‘s	award-winning investigative	journalism	team,	we	have	learned	that	the	“Fordgythe	Foundation” </p>
<p class="calibre1">is	in	fact	a	front	for	German	financial	interests. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	break	in	the	case	came	as	a	result	of	sloppiness	on	the	part	of	“The Foundation,”	probably	because	they	have	been	made	nervous	by	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>‘s intense	investigative	journalism	efforts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Foundation”	left	a	scrap	of	a	funds	transfer	form	in	a	“donation”	it	left	for local	high	school	senior,	Arnold	Junger.  <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>	has	confirmed	that	the	fund transfer	came	from	a	German-based	bank.	We	continue	our	efforts	to	discover exactly	which	bank	it	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	course,	they	don’t	mention	that	their	“investigative	journalism”	consisted	of opening	the	package	I’d	sent	to	Arnold.	I’d	chosen	his	package	as	the	one	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">“accidentally”	contain	the	funds	transfer	form	because	I	knew	that	Arnold	was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p189"></a>Mr.	Dunn’s	nephew.	And	he	was	interning	at	 <i class="calibre3">the	Register</i>,	so	I	sent	it	to	him	at work.	I	was	pretty	sure	that	even	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>‘s	crack	investigative	journalism team	wouldn’t	miss	that	clue. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>	had	not	only	fallen	for	it,	they	had	wrapped	it	in	some	very	bad writing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	dinner	I	asked	my	father	about	it.	“It	looks	like	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>	has	cracked	the Fordgythe	Foundation	case,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	doubt	it,”	he	replied,	stabbing	at	his	peas	with	an	unusual	fierceness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	is	it	that?”	my	mother	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	got	one	scrap	of	a	funds	transfer	form.	There	are	a	thousand	reasons	why that	could	have	been	included	in	with	a	cash	donation.	And	one	of	those	reasons could	even	be	that	the	Fordgythe	people	are	trying	to	throw	 <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>	off	the scent.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’d	be	devious,”	my	mother	said.	She	smiled	at	my	father.	He	smiled	back as	much	as	he	could	given	that	he	wasn’t	smiling	much	these	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	smile	made	me	more	nervous	than	anything	I’d	read	in	either	newspaper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sunday	was	the	big	day,	so	on	Saturday	if	our	house	had	been	tense	before,	now it	was	like	one	of	those	balsa	wood	airplanes	with	a	rubber	band	turned	so	many times	that	the	knots	have	knots	on	top	of	their	knots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimi	and	Ari	came	over	to	take	me	out.	“Let’s	go	spend	some	of	that	German money,”	Mimi	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	leave	that	German	form	in	the	packet	on	purpose?”	Ari	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Accidents	happen,”	I	said,	smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	a	beautiful	night.	As	we	got	on	the	train	to	the	city	the	sky	was	the	color of	the	summer	ocean.	I	checked	to	make	sure	that	my	backpack	was	tightly zipped	and	that	the	straps	were	in	good	shape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	want	to	go	to	a	fancy	restaurant?”	Mimi	asked	excitedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p190"></a>“Actually,	not	really,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,”	Mimi	said.	“I	was	only	pretending	to	want	to	in	case	you	did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	about	a	Chinese	restaurant?”	Ari	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great	idea,”	I	replied.	“Maybe	we	can	find	one	that	isn’t	mainly	a	take-out place.	You	know,	one	with	table	cloths	and	everything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,”	Ari	said.	“So	long	as	they	have	sweet	and	sour.	The	expensive	ones	don’t have	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	fortune	cookies,”	Mimi	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	that	was	our	task:	find	the	best	Chinese	restaurant	that	still	had	sweet	and sour	and	fortune	cookies.	I	like	a	challenge.	But	first,	I	had	an	errand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	spot	next	to	Salzburg	Grille	where	Philip	and	Caroline	had	settled	was	no longer	empty.	New	people	had	taken	it	over,	two	guys	-	probably	in	their twenties,	although	it	can	be	hard	to	tell	-	sleeping	on	a	blanket.	I	didn’t	want	to wake	them,	so	we	went	next	door	and	ordered	four	complete	steak	dinners	to	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	still	asleep	when	we	came	back,	so	we	left	the	bag	between	them.	I put	$1,000	at	the	bottom	of	the	bag	along	with	a	note	from	the	Fordgythe Foundation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hope	they	wake	before	the	food	gets	cold,”	Mimi	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	we	should	go	back	and	wake	them,”	Ari	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	let’s	let	them	sleep,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	we	just	wandered	looking	for	our	perfect	Chinese	restaurant.	Along	the way	we	bought	a	very	bad	giant	pretzel	from	a	push	cart	vendor	who	looked	to be	my	grandfather’s	age.	While	he	hand	the	pretzel	to	Mimi,	I	slipped	a	thousand dollar	bill	into	the	coffee	can	where	he	kept	his	money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	passed	by	a	literacy	clinic	that	teaches	adults	how	to	read.	I	went	into	a	fast food	joint’s	rest	room	and	tied	up	$30,000	with	some	of	my	mother’s	yarn	and packed	the	bundle	and	a	Fordgythe	note	into	one	of	the	envelopes	I’d	brought with	me.	I	shoved	it	through	the	clinic’s	mail	slot.	“Remind	me	to	have	Ms. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p191"></a>Minden	call	first	thing	on	Monday	to	make	sure	that	they	got	it,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	passed	by	a	co-op	store,	the	sort	of	place	that	sells	whole-grain	foods	and	lets people	who	can’t	afford	to	pay	work	there	a	few	hours	a	week	instead.	It	had signs	up	trying	to	raise	money	to	clean	up	the	river.	When	the	clerk	was	busy elsewhere,	I	stuffed	ten	$1,000	bills	into	the	coffee	can	where	you	make donations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	cab	driver	told	us	that	he	sends	money	back	to	his	family	in	Haiti	every	week. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	said	he	was	saving	money	to	bring	them	to	the	United	States.	When	we	got out	of	the	cab,	I	gave	him	an	envelope	with	$15,000	in	it,	but	nothing	identifying it	as	coming	from	The	Foundation.	“This	is	an	extra	tip.	Don’t	open	it	until	after your	next	rider	leaves,”	I	said.	“And	don’t	tell	anyone	that	you	got	it	from	kids.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	next	stop	took	us	past	the	Grille.	The	two	men	were	awake	now.	The remains	of	their	dinner	were	scattered	around	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,”	I	said.	“Good	dinner.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	first	neither	spoke.	They	looked	at	each	other.	The	taller	one	said,	“Yeah. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Really	good,”	eyeing	us	suspiciously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	don’t	you	get	out	of	here.	Quit	staring.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari	stepped	in.	“We’re	not	staring.	We’re	the	ones…”	I	tugged	on	Ari’s	sleeve	to get	him	to	stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	did	what?	Get	out	of	here	before	I	call	a	cop.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	didn’t	do	anything	wrong…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	bothering	me,”	the	man	said.	“This	is	our	space.	Go	on	back	to	your	rich kid	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,”	I	said,	“let’s	leave	them	be.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bye”	Mimi	said.	“Good	luck.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	left,	confused	by	what	had	happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p192"></a>“I	feel	terrible,”	Mimi	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me,	too,”	I	said.	“They	weren’t	very	nice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	were	nervous	about	having	so	much	money	on	them,”	Ari	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	passed	a	veterans’	center.	They	got	an	instant	grant	of	$25,000	from	the Fordgythe	Foundation.	It	was	more	than	I	would	have	given	normally,	but	I	was making	up	for	the	rejection	we’d	just	been	handed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	getting	really	hungry,”	Ari	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	place	looks	promising,”	Mimi	said,	reading	the	menu	of	a	Chinese restaurant	a	few	doors	down	from	the	veteran’s	center.	It	seemed	to	have	it	all, right	down	to	the	fortune	cookies.	It	was	a	little	expensive,	but	what	the	heck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	in	my	backpack.	I	patted	my	pockets.	“You	know	what?”	I	asked.	“I gave	away	all	my	money.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ari	and	Mimi	looked	at	each	other.	Between	us	we	had	$21	and	three	train tickets	back.	“So	we’ll	find	a	cheaper	place	to	eat,”	Mimi	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eighteen	dollars	later,	we	were	full	and	ready	to	go	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p193"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	24</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	debate	was	at	seven	at	night.	By	four	o’clock,	we	were	all	dressed,	my father	had	shined	his	shoes,	and	my	mother	had	checked	Maddie	one	more	time for	lice.	We	were	a	family	clean	and	ready	for	TV. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	station	was	in	the	city,	so	we	took	the	train	in.	The	conductor	recognized me,	impressing	my	parents.	“You’re	becoming	quite	the	traveler,”	my	mother said.	I	only	hoped	that	we	didn’t	end	up	in	a	cab	with	one	particular	Haitian driver. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fortunately,	the	TV	station	was	just	a	few	blocks	from	the	train	station.	It’s	odd that	both	TVs	and	trains	have	stations	since	they’re	really	not	very	much	alike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	the	train	station	was	made	of	grimy	brick	and	concrete,	the	TV	station	was all	glass,	colorful	walls	and	carpet.	The	producer	of	the	show,	a	woman	about	my mother’s	age	named	Laurie	Brooks,	showed	my	family	to	the	“green	room” </p>
<p class="calibre1">where	the	guests	wait	before	they	go	on	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Needless	to	say,	the	green	room	wasn’t	green.	It	was	a	light	tan.	There	were some	not-very-comfortable	couches,	more	mirrors	than	I	like	to	see,	a	television set	tuned	to	that	station’s	broadcast,	and	a	table	with	fruit,	stale	donuts	and coffee.	Maddie	went	straight	for	one	of	the	donuts.	She	doesn’t	care	if	the	donut is	fresh	or	stale	so	long	as	it’s	topped	with	icing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	father	sat	down	and	immediately	opened	up	his	bulging	notebook	of	ideas, notes	and	clippings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	you	think	you	ought	to	take	a	break?”	my	mother	asked.	“You’re	going	to over-prepare.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	even	know	what	that	means,”	my	father	replied,	not	looking	up.	“How can	you	be	too	prepared?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can	be	too	rehearsed.	You	know	what	you	believe,	you	know	all	the	facts that	exist,	you	have	your	arguments	all	set…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	idea.	Jake,	will	you	test	me	on	these	facts?”	he	asked,	handing	me	what must	have	been	fifteen	pages	stapled	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p194"></a>“Don’t,	Jake,”	my	mother	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Torn	between	two	parents!”	I	replied.	“Don’t	you	know	what	this	does	to	my delicate	emotional	state?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	pay	for	your	psychiatrist,”	my	father	said,	the	closest	he’d	come	to	a	joke in	a	week.	I	was	going	to	be	very	glad	when	this	debate	was	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	father	took	the	packet	of	facts	back	from	me	and	started	studying	on	his own.	My	mother	stood	up.	“Maybe	we	should	leave	your	father	alone	to	over-prepare	himself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	as	she	started	to	lead	Maddie	away	from	the	snack	table,	the	door	opened and	in	came	Mr.	Dunn	with	Amanda	and	three	men	in	suits.	He	stood	in	the doorway	for	a	moment,	looking	disapprovingly	at	the	sofa,	the	food,	and	finally my	father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	father	stood	up	but	Mr.	Dunn	made	no	move	to	come	greet	him.	“Hello,”	my father	said.	“Ready	for	a	good,	honest	debate?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amanda	pinched	a	donut	and	dropped	it	in	disgust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	ready	to	take	on	those	who	would	deny	our	citizens	the	right	to	choose	their own	form	of	amusement,”	answered	Mr.	Dunn.	One	of	the	men	in	suits	leaned into	him	and	whispered	in	his	ear.	“Who	don’t	trust	our	citizens	to	choose	their own	form	of	amusement,”	Mr.	Dunn	corrected	himself.	Apparently	“trust”	was	a key	word	for	him	to	work	into	the	debate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,”	my	father	said,	perhaps	regretting	not	taking	up	the	Fordgythe Foundation’s	offer	to	fly	Mischa	out,	“I’m	sure	it	will	be	a	good,	spirited	debate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	what	democracy	is	all	about.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Democracy	is	all	about	trusting	citizens	to	choose	their	own	form	of entertainment,”	said	Mr.	Dunn,	looking	at	the	man	in	the	suit	for	approval.	The man	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	mother	said,	“Honey,	I’m	taking	the	kids	out	for	a	bite	to	eat.	Would	you	like to	join	us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	need	to…” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p195"></a>“Please	do	join	us,”	my	mother	said	firmly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	the	door	to	the	green	room	closed	my	mother	said,	“I	wasn’t	going	to	leave you	there	for	another	minute	with	that	awful	man.	Let’s	go	get	a	cup	of	coffee and	a	real	donut.	That’ll	be	much	better	for	you	than	sitting	there	as	Mr.	Dunn uses	you	for	target	practice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	good,”	my	father	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	over-prepared,”	my	mother	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently	we	took	too	long	because	when	we	came	back,	Laurie	the	producer was	very	glad	to	see	us.	“Thank	goodness!	We	have	to	get	you	right	into makeup.”	My	father	made	a	face,	which	Laurie	immediately	understood.	“If	we don’t	put	on	makeup,”	she	explained,	“you	won’t	look	the	way	you	actually	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	led	us	to	the	chair	where	the	makeup	person	started	dusting	him	with powder.	I	made	sure	not	to	make	fun	of	my	father,	tempting	though	it	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Laurie	patted	my	father	on	the	shoulder,	and	said	“You’ll	do	fine.	That	other man’s	just	a	bully.”	Then	she	led	us	to	our	seats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	studio	was	quite	small	with	room	for	about	50	people,	although,	as	a	camera showed	us,	it	looked	much	bigger	when	broadcast.	I	think	that’s	because	if	you show	a	row	of	ten	people	on	TV,	the	viewer	assumes	that	the	row	extends	in	both directions	even	when	it	doesn’t,	like	being	on	the	ocean	and	assuming	that	the sea	keeps	going	over	past	the	horizon.	Except	you’re	right	when	it	comes	to	the ocean. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	were	almost	the	first	people	there.	Laurie	pointed	to	a	woman	standing	in	the back	of	the	theatre.	“That’s	Margaret	Houle.	She’s	in	charge	of	all	programming for	the	station.	If	she	likes	how	your	father	does	today…”	She	left	the	sentence hanging	and	then	said,	“Well,	I	have	to	be	getting	back.	I’m	sure	your	father	will do	well.	People	will	just	like	him	when	they	hear	him.	I	have	an	eye	for	these things.”	I	was	sure	she	was	right.	Of	course,	my	father	didn’t	want	to	be	liked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wanted	to	convince	people	that	the	lottery	is	a	bad	idea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	studio	was	beginning	to	fill	up.	I	recognized	a	few	people	who	worked	for Mr.	Dunn,	and	most	of	the	tiny	staff	of	 <i class="calibre3">The	Gaz</i>	was	there	as	well.	Otherwise, there	was	only	one	face	that	I	recognized:	Mrs.	Fordgythe.	She	was	in	the	back on	the	other	side.	She	waved	to	me.	I	gave	a	quick	wave	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p196"></a>“Who’s	that,	dear?”	my	mother	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Someone	I	met	on	line	at	the	Herb’s	Pick-a-Chick	store.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	must	be	nice	to	remember	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	she	seemed	very	nice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ms.	Houle	was	still	standing	in	the	back,	her	arms	crossed.	Waiting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	moderator	of	the	event	was	the	local	television	anchorperson,	Lola	Freitag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	TV	she	seemed	to	be	the	sort	of	person	who	could	only	speak	from	cue	cards, although	when	she	talked	to	the	audience	five	minutes	before	the	show	started, she	was	actually	quite	good.	She	explained	the	rules	of	the	half-hour	debate	and sternly	told	us	not	to	applaud	except	when	the	“Applause”	light	went	on.	“You’ll just	be	taking	time	away	from	the	person	you’re	applauding	for,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	sign	that	tells	you	when	to	applaud.	That	really	seems	wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	father	and	Mr.	Dunn	came	out	from	the	same	side	of	the	studio	and	walked to	their	podiums.	From	the	way	they	didn’t	look	at	each	other,	it	seemed	that they	hadn’t	gotten	any	friendlier.	Mr.	Dunn	stood	there,	as	straight	as	a	column holding	up	a	porch.	He	stared	directly	in	front	of	him,	his	hands	held	just	above the	waist,	bent	at	the	elbows,	undoubtedly	as	he	had	been	taught	at	media	school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	father	was	bowed	over	his	podium,	frantically	spreading	out	notes,	running his	hands	through	his	hair	exactly	as	media	school	would	have	told	him	not	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Welcome	to	the	great	debate	on	the	state	lottery,”	said	Lola	Freitag,	and	so	it began.	As	Lola	introduced	the	two	debaters,	the	camera	focused	on	each.	There were	monitors	in	the	studio,	of	course,	so	we	could	see	what	the	home	viewers could	see.	Mr.	Dunn	looked	like	he	was	a	senior	news	anchor,	completely	at home	in	front	of	the	camera.	My	father	looked	like	he	had	slept	in	his	clothes and	was	slightly	confused	about	why	he	was	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lola	explained	the	rules.	Each	debater	was	going	to	be	given	three	minutes	to present	his	point	of	view.	Then	Lola	would	ask	each	of	them	some	questions	“to clarify	their	points	of	view.”	Then	the	two	debaters	would	get	to	ask	each	other questions.	Finally,	they’d	each	get	a	minute	to	conclude.	It	sounded	simple,	yet	I was	scared	purple,	especially	about	the	part	when	Mr.	Dunn	would	get	to	ask	my father	questions.	I	was	sure	that	his	team	had	worked	long	and	hard	on	coming</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p197"></a>up	with	the	questions	that	would	make	my	father	look	as	bad	as	possible.	My father	meanwhile	had	focused	on	questions	that	he	thought	would	bring	a reasonable	person	closer	to	the	truth.	The	problem	was	that	Mr.	Dunn	didn’t intend	to	be	reasonable.	He	intended	to	win. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	starting	off	looking	fidgety,	I	thought	my	father	did	great	in	his	opening statement.	True,	even	though	he	had	timed	himself	over	and	over	to	make	sure that	he	came	in	under	three	minutes,	he	ended	up	having	to	rush	through	the	last fifteen	seconds,	covering	the	last	two	points	in	just	a	couple	of	sentences	and without	inhaling.	That	aside,	he	did	great. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Dunn	did	better.	Even	though	I	disagreed	with	him	and	could	see	the	holes in	what	he	was	saying,	I	had	to	admit	that	unless	your	father	had	been	lecturing you	all	your	life	about	why	the	lottery	is	a	bad	idea,	you	would	have	found	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dunn’s	opening	comments	persuasive.	Plus,	it	was	as	if	he	was	relaxing	at	his kitchen	table	after	dinner,	slowly	and	calmly	explaining	himself,	confident	that he	was	right	and	enjoying	himself.	He	was	good	at	TV. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	hopes	that	Lola	would	ask	the	questions	that	would	show	everyone	what	was wrong	with	Mr.	Dunn’s	argument	were	dashed	as	soon	as	she	opened	her	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	could	see	that	she	was	reading	the	questions	off	a	printed	sheet.	They	had nothing	to	do	with	what	either	my	father	or	Mr.	Dunn	had	just	said.	If	anything, they	were	harder	on	my	father	than	on	Mr.	Dunn.	For	example,	she	asked	my father	what	taxes	he	would	raise	to	make	up	for	the	money	the	state	would	lose	if it	cancelled	the	lottery.	Dad	answered	well,	I	thought:	“We	might	not	have	to raise	taxes.	We	might	move	the	money	from	other	programs.	But,	Ms.	Freitag, the	point	to	remember	is	that	the	lottery	is	itself	a	tax,	a	tax	on	the	poorest	in	our state.	We	target	advertisements	at	them,	convincing	them	that	they	can	magically escape	their	poverty,	and	the	money	that	we	gather	from	them	is	taken	out	of their	community	and	used	to	finance	the	educational	system	for	the	rich	as	well as	the	poor.	Our	poorest	communities	are	losers	in	this	system.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lola	might	have	followed	up	on	this.	She	might	have	asked	if	my	father	would be	satisfied	if	the	state	government	stopped	advertising	the	lottery.	She	might have	asked	if	he’d	be	satisfied	if	more	of	the	money	that	was	raised	was	given	to poor	neighborhoods	instead	of	spreading	it	evenly	across	all	communities.	But those	questions	weren’t	on	her	prepared	sheet,	so	she	instead	asked	Mr.	Dunn what	I	thought	was	a	much	easier	question:	“Are	there	any	changes	you’d	make to	the	lottery	system	at	all?”	Mr.	Dunn	said	that	he’d	run	it	more	often	and	offer</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p198"></a>more	and	bigger	prizes.	Nice.	You	can’t	go	wrong	offering	people	more	money more	often. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	only	half-listened	to	these	questions	and	answers.	The	other	half	of	me	was trying	to	figure	out	what	Mr.	Dunn	was	going	to	ask	my	father.	And	the remaining	part	me	-	which,	when	you	add	two	halves	together	doesn’t	leave much	left	over	-	was	listening	to	Maddie	complaining	to	my	mother	that	she	had to	go	to	the	bathroom.	“Can	you	hold	it	for	another	few	minutes?”	my	mother asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	really	have	to	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	mother	sighed	and	started	to	get	up.	Just	then	Mr.	Dunn	got	to	ask	his	first question	of	my	father.	“Mr.	Richter,	I	understand	that	you	are	personally	quite strongly	opposed	to	the	lottery.	But	is	your	family	equally	opposed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	see	what	that	has	to	do	with	anything,”	my	father	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	will	once	I	tell	you	who	is	truly	behind	the	Fordgythe	Foundation.”	My mother	sat	down	again	and	when	Maddie	started	to	whine,	she	cut	her	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll	just	have	to	hold	it	in	for	a	few	more	minutes.”	Maddie	frowned	but stopped	whining. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	you	already	cracked	that	one,	Mr.	Dunn.	The	Germans.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Dunn’s	faced	turned	an	ugly	violet	color.	I	thought	he	might	be	having trouble	breathing	but	then	I	realized	that	it	was	how	he	blushed.	He	did	it	so infrequently	that	it	made	his	face	look	like	it	was	bruised.	“That	was	based	on preliminary	information…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Plastered	all	over	your	front	page	on	Friday,”	my	father	said.	He	didn’t	seem fidgety	and	awkward	any	more.	“So,	you	realize	that	your	big	breakthrough article	is	all	wrong?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	based	on	preliminary	information.	But	our	further	investigation	has turned	up	something	even	more	interesting.	Let	me	ask	you:	Do	you	think	the Fordgythe	Foundation	is	doing	remarkably	good	work?”	Mr.	Dunn	sure	had changed	his	tone	about	the	Foundation.	Except	now	I	felt	like	I	had	to	go	to	the bathroom.	I	didn’t	like	where	this	was	heading. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p199"></a>“Overall,	I’d	have	to	say,	yes,	the	Fordgythe	Foundation	has	been	a	blessing	to this	town,”	my	father	said,	to	my	great	relief.	“Some	of	the	donations	seem	a little	eccentric,	but	it’s	brought	relief	to	people	who	need	it	and	it’s	supported organizations	that	help	the	neediest	in	our	town.	But	from	the	editorials	you’ve been	writing	about	it,	you,	Mr.	Dunn,	seem	to	think	it’s	something	like	a gangster	organization.	I	believe	your	newspaper	reported	that	it’s	being	funded by	drug	money.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Preliminary	investigation,”	Mr.	Dunn	muttered	quickly.	“I	am	glad	that	you	and I	are	in	agreement	on	this	crucial	point.	The	Fordgythe	Foundation	has	been	a positive	force	in	our	community.”	He	paused	for	a	drink	of	water	that	he probably	didn’t	need.	It	increased	the	suspense,	though. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	see	what	this	has	to	do	with	the	lottery,”	my	father	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lola	took	this	opportunity	to	say,	“You’re	supposed	to	be	asking	a	question,	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dunn…”	but	my	father	looked	at	her,	patted	the	air	in	front	of	him,	and	nodded to	say	that	he	was	ok	with	the	way	it	was	going. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Dun	carefully	put	down	the	glass	of	water	and	adjusted	his	tie.	“Suppose	I were	to	tell	you	that	we	have	discovered	that	the	Fordgythe	Foundation	is	in	fact funded	entirely	and	completely	by	the	mystery	winner	of	the	$111,000,000</p>
<p class="calibre1">lottery	jackpot	awarded	a	few	months	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	audience	didn’t	breath.	The	silence	was	noticeable.	I	could	feel	all	the	blood leaving	my	face.	I’m	not	sure	where	it	went,	but	I	was	positive	my	face	was white	with	fear	about	what	was	about	to	happen.	My	mother	looked	at	me, concerned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Dunn’s	gaze	swept	the	audience	from	one	side	to	another	as	his	tight-lipped smile	seemed	to	say,	“You	agree	that	I	just	won	the	debate,	don’t	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Mr.	Dunn	was	about	to	talk	again,	my	father	said,	“I	know.	The	winner	is	my son.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	audience	gasped.	The	camera	looked	at	my	father.	It	looked	at	Mr.	Dunn.	It looked	at	Lola.	It	looked	back	at	my	father	who	was	staring	straight	at	me.	The camera	followed	his	eyes	and	found	me.	It	zoomed	in	until	all	you	could	see	was my	face,	white	as	snow,	and	next	to	me	Maddie	jumping	up	and	down	in	her seat,	yelling,	“Yay!	We	won!	I	get	10	dollars!”	The	things	that	little	kids</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p200"></a>remember. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	thundered	Mr.	Dunn.	“Your	son!	Your	very	own	son!	Ladies	and gentlemen,	here	we	have	the	living	proof	that	good	things	come	from	the	lottery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	not	in	some	roundabout	or	complicated	way,	but	right	in	the	home	of	the leading	opponent	of	the	lottery.	I	rest	my	case.”	And	with	that,	Mr.	Dunn	crossed his	arms	and	leaned	back,	away	from	the	microphone	on	his	podium. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	my	father	didn’t	look	like	a	man	who	had	lost	a	debate.	He	stood	up straighter.	Suddenly	his	clothes	hung	on	him	right.	His	voice	was	firm.	Looking directly	at	Mr.	Dunn	who	refused	to	turn	towards	him,	my	father	said,	“How dare	you,	Mr.	Dunn?	How	dare	you?	My	son	was	given	a	lottery	ticket	by	a	kind elderly	lady	whom	he	had	helped.	He	kept	the	fact	that	he	won	secret	from everyone	except	a	couple	of	friends	because	he	knew	we	disapproved.”	How	did my	father	know	all	this?	“I	only	found	out	about	this	yesterday.	My	wife	found out	a	few	days	before.	We	haven’t	even	told	our	son	that	we	know	because	we respect	him.	And	let	me	tell	you	something:	He	has	earned	our	respect.	Can	you imagine	being	a	young	man	with	such	a	secret?	Can	you	imagine	the	sort	of character	it	takes	to	do	what	he’s	done	with	the	Fordgythe	Foundation?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	father	looked	at	me.	I	think	everyone	in	the	audience,	in	the	studio	or	at home,	must	have	seen	how	much	he	loves	me.	It	was	embarrassing,	but	I’ll never	forget	that	look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	you	think	you’ve	made	a	mighty	point	about	the	lottery	by	betraying	this good-hearted	boy’s	secret.	But	you	haven’t	at	all.	You	think	that	you’ve	proved that	people	who	win	the	lottery	use	the	money	for	good,	giving	back	to	the community.	But	you	know	that	that’s	not	true.	People	use	the	money	for whatever	they	want	to	use	the	money	for.	Sometimes	it’s	a	tremendous	help	to them	and	their	loved	ones.	And	sometimes	it	destroys	their	lives.	But	that	has nothing	to	do	with	why	I’m	opposed	to	the	lottery.	It’s	not	because	of	what	it does	to	the	winners.	It’s	because	of	what	it	does	to	the	losers	and	what	promoting the	lottery	does	to	our	idea	of	what	our	government	is	about.	I	think	that	it	turns our	government	into	a	casino	that’s	trying	to	trick	us	out	of	our	hard-earned money.	But	I’ve	made	that	case	here	tonight	and	you’ve	chosen	to	ignore	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead,	you’d	rather	betray	the	secrets	of	the	biggest-hearted	child	you’ll	ever have	the	privilege	to	meet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	he	wasn’t	done.	“Let	me	be	clear	here	tonight,	Mr.	Dunn.	You	see	my	son	as</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p201"></a>a	point	you	can	use	for	your	side.	That’s	all	he	is	to	you.	But	the	point	doesn’t even	work.	The	fact	is	that	what	my	son	has	done	is	truly	exceptional.	Who among	us,	if	we’d	won	all	that	money,	would	think	only	about	how	best	he	could give	it	away?	Who	would	find	in	his	riches	a	connection	to	the	poorest,	the weakest,	those	most	needing	help?	Would	you,	Mr.	Dunn?	Have	you,	Mr.	Dunn? </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	all	your	riches,	have	you?	You	don’t	need	to	answer	that.	The	fact	is	that my	son	is	one	in	a	one	hundred	and	eleven	million.	So	you	can’t	use	him	as	an argument	in	favor	of	the	lottery.	He’s	exceptional.	That	means	he’s	what	usually <i class="calibre3">doesn’t</i>	happen	when	people	win	a	lottery.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	continued,	“He’s	my	son,	Mr.	Dunn,	and	you	and	this	community	are	lucky that	he’s	the	one	who	won.	And	we	are	the	luckiest	parents	in	the	world,	not because	our	son	won	the	lottery	but	because	we	have	such	a	son.	So,	no,	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dunn,	your	amazing	fact	doesn’t	change	my	mind	one	bit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	think	there	was	applause.	Probably	a	lot.	I	know	there	was	a	whole	bunch	of hugging.	I	remember	hugging	Mrs.	Fordgythe,	and	only	reaching	about	a	third	of the	way	around	her.	And	since	the	biggest	hug	came	from	my	father	and	since	I didn’t	go	up	on	stage,	I	think	the	debate	must	have	ended	at	that	point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	thing	I	remember	very	clearly,	though:	Maddie	saying,	“Oops.	Too	late.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p202"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	25</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	did	you	know?”	What	else	was	I	going	to	ask?	How’s	the	weather?	Do you	know	the	first	Pacific	island	that	Magellan	stopped	at	during	his	brave circumnavigation	of	the	globe? </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	parents	had	hurried	me	and	Mrs.	Fordgythe	out	of	the	studio	before	the	press could	catch	us.	We	jumped	into	a	taxi	and	were	going	to	go	to	the	train	station, when	my	mother	said,	“The	press	will	be	waiting	for	us	there.”	My	parents looked	at	each	other,	shrugged	their	shoulders,	and	told	the	taxi	driver	to	take	us all	the	way	home.	Why	not? </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	mother	said,	“I	was	pretty	sure	last	week	because	of	the	sorts	of	people	who were	getting	donations.	It	seemed	that	a	lot	of	places	that	our	family	cares	about were	getting	money	from	the	Fordgythe	Foundation.”	For	some	reason,	I	was reminded	of	Mr.	Sadler’s	cowboy	story:	“Know	the	people…”	Of	course, sometimes	people	you	don’t	know	need	money,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course,”	my	mother	said,	“that	was	just	a	hunch.	I	didn’t	think	it	could	really be	true	because,	well,	it	was	all	so	much.	You	set	up	a	foundation.	You	were running	an	entire	charity.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	how’d	you	figure	it	out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An	article	in	the	paper	said	that	the	bundles	of	money	were	all	tied	with	pink and	purple	yarn	with	little	sparkly	flecks	in	it.	You	think	I	wouldn’t	recognize my	own	yarn,	Jake?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“D’oh!”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	then	I	asked	Ari.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Figures!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	he	wouldn’t	tell	me	a	thing.	So	I	asked	Mimi.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mimi	gave	me	away?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	yes.	But	only	after	I	told	her	that	I’d	do	my	best	to	keep	it	a	secret,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p203"></a>after	I’d	told	her	how	proud	I	am	of	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	when	did	you	tell	Dad?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yesterday.	I	had	to.	I	knew	Mr.	Dunn	was	up	to	something.	That	awful	Matt boy	was	snooping	around.	I	think	he	was	following	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	caught	him	at	it	last	week	but	it	was	just	about	a	missing	spoon	at	the	Dunns’</p>
<p class="calibre1">house.”	My	parents	looked	puzzled.	“It’s	a	long	story.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,”	said	my	mother,	“I	think	Matt	may	not	have	told	you	the	entire	truth.	I saw	him	following	you	on	Saturday	afternoon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	must	have	seen	us	in	the	city.	We	gave	away	a	whole	bunch	of	money	on Saturday	night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	here	we	thought	you	were	wasting	quarters	in	the	arcade,”	my	father	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	we	did	that,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	dropped	Mrs.	Fordgythe	off	at	her	house.	It	was	more	like	a	mansion.	The driveway	went	on	long	enough	to	need	traffic	signals.	I	got	out	of	the	taxi	with her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	so	proud	of	you,	my	boy,”	she	said,	her	hat	blocking	out	all	of	the	moon and	half	of	the	stars.	She	held	my	hand	in	one	of	hers	and	patted	it	with	her other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	like	my	fairy	godmother,”	I	said	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	no	such	thing.”	She	looked	me	straight	in	the	eye	and	no	longer	seemed to	be	so	flighty.	“But	if	there	were,	I	wouldn’t	have	been	 <i class="calibre3">your</i>	fairy	godmother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wouldn’t	I	really	have	been	the	fairy	godmother	of	all	the	people	you’ve	helped and	all	the	people	you’re	going	to	help?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	when	I	cried.	She	gave	me	another	mountainous	hug.	“I	so	look	forward to	watching	you	grow,”	she	said.	“I	so	look	forward	to	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	here’s	the	rest	of	what	happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p204"></a>I	was	interviewed	by	every	newspaper	and	television	show	on	the	planet	and possibly	some	from	other	planets;	that	would	explain	some	of	the	weird questions	they	asked	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	mother	became	head	of	the	Fordgythe	Foundation.	Ms.	Minden	was	the second	person	in	charge.	That’s	a	full-time	job,	so	she	quit	her	job	at	the	bank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	father	still	edits	 <i class="calibre3">The	Gaz</i>	because	that’s	what	he	loves	to	do.	He	also	enjoys the	weekly	news	talk	show	he	has	on	the	TV	station.	Laurie	is	his	producer. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The	Gaz</i>	is	now	the	number	one	newspaper	in	the	region.  <i class="calibre3">The	Register</i>	is	still around	but	it	just	doesn’t	have	the	old	oomph.	Mr.	Dunn	doesn’t	have	much	to do	with	the	paper	any	more.	He	keeps	busy	with	the	thousand	other	businesses he	owns.	But	he’s	sure	as	heck	not	running	for	governor	any	time	soon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon	after	my	mother	became	the	head	of	the	Foundation,	we	had	a	big	family meeting,	with	Mrs.	Fordgythe	and	Ari	and	Mimi.	We	also	had	a	woman	who knows	all	about	managing	money	there;	she	was	recommended	by	Ms.	Harrigan at	the	bank.	We	got	together	to	talk	about	how	we	want	the	Foundation	to	spend its	money.	The	basic	principle	we	came	up	with	is	simple:	We	should	spend	it where	it	will	do	the	most	good.	Simple	to	say	but	really	hard	to	put	into	practice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	decided	that	we	wanted	to	continue	to	spend	some	in	our	town	because	those people	are	the	closest	to	us	-	and	not	just	in	terms	of	distance	-	but	that	we	also should	look	into	donating	money	elsewhere	in	the	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	conversation	has	turned	into	what	seems	like	it	will	be,	literally,	a	lifetime of	conversations	about	how	we	can	best	spend	the	money	that	I	won	by	accident, did	nothing	to	earn,	and	don’t	deserve.	I	don’t	think	there’s	any	topic	more interesting.	But	it’s	also	hard	because	it	means	learning	about	the	suffering	so much	of	the	world	undergoes	every	day.	Worse,	it	means	choosing	not	to	help some	people	who	deserve	it	because,	while	$100,000,000	is	a	lot	of	money,	it’s nothing	compared	with	the	amount	of	money	the	world	needs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	decided	that	since	much	of	the	worst	suffering	is	outside	of	this	country,	we ought	to	be	helping	out	there,	too.	So,	we’ve	been	all	over	the	world.	And	my family	has	discovered	that	we	love	traveling.	Often	our	journeys	take	us	to places	that	make	you	sad	and	sometimes	make	you	ashamed	to	be	members	of	a species	that	lets	such	suffering	happen,	but	we	also	go	on	trips	for	fun.	We	live	at home	as	we	always	have,	but	we	travel	like	rich	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p205"></a>Of	course,	now	that	I	don’t	have	to	hide	my	money	from	my	parents,	I	also	can spend	it	on	myself	more.	But	I	don’t	enjoy	spending	money.	I	know	it	sounds odd,	but	when	you	realize	that	you	have	enough	to	buy	anything	you	want, there’s	not	much	thrill	in	buying	stuff.	So,	I	now	have	an	aquarium	so	big	that we	have	to	keep	it	in	the	living	room,	and	it’s	got	some	very	cool	fish	in	it.	Plus, I	own	just	about	every	halfway	decent	video	game	that’s	come	out.	And	The Scutters	is	one	of	the	best-equipped	bands	around.	Unfortunately,	we	still	sound bad.	But	beyond	that,	just	having	stuff	doesn’t	make	me	happy.	So,	I	don’t	buy	a lot	of	stuff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maddie’s	money	is	sitting	in	the	bank.	When	she	gets	old	enough,	she’s	going	to have	her	own	foundation.	She	doesn’t	know	about	that	yet.	She’s	still	thrilled that	she	has	ten	dollars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimi	and	Ari	thought	they	might	become	boyfriend	and	girlfriend	now	that	Ari has	stopped	forcing	himself	to	be	so	Ari-ish.	Then	they	look	at	each	other, laughed,	and	went	back	to	being	two	of	the	three	best	friends	who	ever	existed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’re	certainly	more	popular	than	we	were	back	before	we	became	three	of	the richest	best	friends	who	ever	existed.	Kids	know	who	we	are.	They	nod	at	us when	they	see	us	in	the	hall.	We	get	invited	to	parties.	But	we	can’t	tell	how much	of	it	is	due	to	the	money.	So	now	we’re	popular,	but	it	doesn’t	mean anything	to	us.	The	thing	is,	I	think	popularity	is	always	like	that:	the	reasons people	become	popular	are	too	confusing	and	messed	up	to	make	popularity	a way	of	telling	anything	real	about	yourself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	what	about	the	lottery	itself?	Because	of	all	the	publicity	around	my	big win,	the	question	of	whether	there	should	be	a	lottery	got	put	on	the	ballot	so that	at	the	next	election,	everyone	got	to	vote	on	whether	the	state	ought	to	quit it.	My	father	spent	most	of	two	months	going	around	the	state	giving	speeches against	the	lottery.	On	election	night,	we	all	stayed	up	late	to	see	the	results.	And it	was	a	landslide:	The	people	of	our	state	voted	overwhelmingly	to	keep	on having	a	lottery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	disappointed.	But	who	am	I	to	complain? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thank	You</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thanks	first	to	our	three	children	for	being	interested	in	books	and	stories. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p206"></a>Thanks	also	to	those	who	read	early	versions	and	made	helpful	comments, including,	Jerry	Gasche,	Staci	Kramer,	Alexandra	Noss,	and	Michael	Shook.	A special	thanks	to	Julianne	Chatelain	for	her	many,	many	suggestions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	special	thank	you	to	Stellio	LLC	(stelliollc.com)	for	designing	the	covers	and the	layout	of	the	book.	It	looks	pretty	good,	doesn’t	it? </p>
