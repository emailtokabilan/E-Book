<p class="calibre1">"Want a bite?" she said, innocently.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah," I said. I like spicy food. I always order the curries with four chilies next to them on the menu at the Pakistani places.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I peeled back more foil and took a big bite.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Big mistake.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You know that feeling you get when you take a big bite of horseradish or wasabi or whatever, and it feels like your sinuses are closing at the same time as your windpipe, filling your head with trapped, nuclear-hot air that tries to batter its way out through your watering eyes and nostrils? That feeling like steam is about to pour out of your ears like a cartoon character?</p>
<p class="calibre1">This was a lot worse.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This was like putting your hand on a hot stove, only it's not your hand, it's the entire inside of your head, and your esophagus all the way down to your stomach. My entire body sprang out in a sweat and I choked and choked.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wordlessly, she passed me my horchata and I managed to get the straw into my mouth and suck hard on it, gulping down half of it in one go.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So there's a scale, the Scoville scale, that we chili-fanciers use to talk about how spicy a pepper is. Pure capsaicin is about 15 million Scovilles. Tabasco is about 50,000. Pepper spray is a healthy three million. This stuff is a puny 200,000, about as hot as a mild Scotch Bonnet Pepper. I worked up to it in about a year. Some of the real hardcore can get up to a million or so, twenty times hotter than Tabasco. That's pretty freaking hot. At Scoville temperatures like that, your brain gets totally awash in endorphins. It's a better body-stone than hash. And it's good for you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was getting my sinuses back now, able to breathe without gasping.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of course, you get a ferocious ring of fire when you go to the john," she said, winking at me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Yowch.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You are insane," I said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fine talk from a man whose hobby is building and smashing laptops," she said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Touche," I said and touched my forehead.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Want some?" She held out her mister.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pass," I said, quickly enough that we both laughed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When we left the restaurant and headed for Dolores park, she put her arm around my waist and I found that she was just the right height for me to put my arm around her shoulders. That was new. I'd never been a tall guy, and the girls I'd dated had all been my height -- teenaged girls grow faster than guys, which is a cruel trick of nature. It was nice. It felt nice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We turned the corner on 20th Street and walked up toward Dolores. Before we'd taken a single step, we could feel the buzz. It was like the hum of a million bees. There were lots of people streaming toward the park, and when I looked toward it, I saw that it was about a hundred times more crowded than it had been when I went to meet Ange.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That sight made my blood run hot. It was a beautiful cool night and we were about to party, really party, party like there was no tomorrow. "Eat drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Without saying anything we both broke into a trot. There were lots of cops, with tense faces, but what the hell were they going to do? There were a <i class="calibre6">lot</i> of people in the park. I'm not so good at counting crowds. The papers later quoted organizers as saying there were 20,000 people; the cops said 5,000. Maybe that means there were 12,500.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whatever. It was more people than I'd ever stood among, as part of an unscheduled, unsanctioned, <i class="calibre6">illegal</i> event.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We were among them in an instant. I can't swear to it, but I don't think there was anyone over 25 in that press of bodies. Everyone was smiling. Some young kids were there, 10 or 12, and that made me feel better. No one would do anything too stupid with kids that little in the crowd. No one wanted to see little kids get hurt. This was just going to be a glorious spring night of celebration.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I figured the thing to do was push in towards the tennis courts. We threaded our way through the crowd, and to stay together we took each other's hands. Only staying together didn't require us to intertwine fingers. That was strictly for pleasure. It was very pleasurable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The bands were all inside the tennis courts, with their guitars and mixers and keyboards and even a drum kit. Later, on Xnet, I found a Flickr stream of them smuggling all this stuff in, piece by piece, in gym bags and under their coats. Along with it all were huge speakers, the kind you see in automotive supply places, and among them, a stack of...car batteries. I laughed. Genius! That was how they were going to power their stacks. From where I stood, I could see that they were cells from a hybrid car, a Prius. Someone had gutted an eco-mobile to power the night's entertainment. The batteries continued outside the courts, stacked up against the fence, tethered to the main stack by wires threaded through the chain-link. I counted -- 200 batteries! Christ! Those things weighed a ton, too.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There's no way they organized this without email and wikis and mailing lists. And there's no way people this smart would have done that on the public Internet. This had all taken place on the Xnet, I'd bet my boots on it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We just kind of bounced around in the crowd for a while as the bands tuned up and conferred with one another. I saw Trudy Doo from a distance, in the tennis courts. She looked like she was in a cage, like a pro wrestler. She was wearing a torn wife-beater and her hair was in long, fluorescent pink dreads down to her waist. She was wearing army camouflage pants and giant gothy boots with steel over-toes. As I watched, she picked up a heavy motorcycle jacket, worn as a catcher's mitt, and put it on like armor. It probably was armor, I realized.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I tried to wave to her, to impress Ange I guess, but she didn't see me and I kind of looked like a spazz so I stopped. The energy in the crowd was amazing. You hear people talk about "vibes" and "energy" for big groups of people, but until you've experienced it, you probably think it's just a figure of speech.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It's not. It's the smiles, infectious and big as watermelons, on every face. Everyone bopping a little to an unheard rhythm, shoulders rocking. Rolling walks. Jokes and laughs. The tone of every voice tight and excited, like a firework about to go off. And you can't help but be a part of it. Because you are.</p>
<p class="calibre1">By the time the bands kicked off, I was utterly stoned on crowd-vibe. The opening act was some kind of Serbian turbo-folk, which I couldn't figure out how to dance to. I know how to dance to exactly two kinds of music: trance (shuffle around and let the music move you) and punk (bash around and mosh until you get hurt or exhausted or both). The next act was Oakland hip-hoppers, backed by a thrash metal band, which is better than it sounds. Then some bubble-gum pop. Then Speedwhores took the stage, and Trudy Doo stepped up to the mic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"My name is Trudy Doo and you're an idiot if you trust me. I'm thirty two and it's too late for me. I'm lost. I'm stuck in the old way of thinking. I still take my freedom for granted and let other people take it away from me. You're the first generation to grow up in Gulag America, and you know what your freedom is worth to the last goddamned cent!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The crowd roared. She was playing fast little skittery nervous chords on her guitar and her bass player, a huge fat girl with a dykey haircut and even bigger boots and a smile you could open beer bottles with was laying it down fast and hard already. I wanted to bounce. I bounced. Ange bounced with me. We were sweating freely in the evening, which reeked of perspiration and pot smoke. Warm bodies crushed in on all sides of us. They bounced too.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't trust anyone over 25!" she shouted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We roared. We were one big animal throat, roaring.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't trust anyone over 25!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"<i class="calibre6">Don't trust anyone over 25!</i>"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't trust anyone over 25!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"<i class="calibre6">Don't trust anyone over 25!</i>"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't trust anyone over 25!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"<i class="calibre6">Don't trust anyone over 25!</i>"</p>
<p class="calibre1">She banged some hard chords on her guitar and the other guitarist, a little pixie of a girl whose face bristled with piercings, jammed in, going wheedle-dee-wheedle-dee-dee up high, past the twelfth fret.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's our goddamned city! It's our goddamned country. No terrorist can take it from us for so long as we're free. Once we're not free, the terrorists win! Take it back! Take it back! You're young enough and stupid enough not to know that you can't possibly win, so you're the only ones who can lead us to victory! <i class="calibre6">Take it back!</i>"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"TAKE IT BACK!" we roared. She jammed down hard on her guitar. We roared the note back and then it got really really LOUD.</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">I danced until I was so tired I couldn't dance another step. Ange danced alongside of me. Technically, we were rubbing our sweaty bodies against each other for several hours, but believe it or not, I totally wasn't being a horn-dog about it. We were dancing, lost in the godbeat and the thrash and the screaming -- TAKE IT BACK! TAKE IT BACK!</p>
<p class="calibre1">When I couldn't dance anymore, I grabbed her hand and she squeezed mine like I was keeping her from falling off a building. She dragged me toward the edge of the crowd, where it got thinner and cooler. Out there, on the edge of Dolores Park, we were in the cool air and the sweat on our bodies went instantly icy. We shivered and she threw her arms around my waist. "Warm me," she commanded. I didn't need a hint. I hugged her back. Her heart was an echo of the fast beats from the stage -- breakbeats now, fast and furious and wordless.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She smelled of sweat, a sharp tang that smelled great. I knew I smelled of sweat too. My nose was pointed into the top of her head, and her face was right at my collarbone. She moved her hands to my neck and tugged.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Get down here, I didn't bring a stepladder," is what she said and I tried to smile, but it's hard to smile when you're kissing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Like I said, I'd kissed three girls in my life. Two of them had never kissed anyone before. One had been dating since she was 12. She had issues.</p>
<p class="calibre1">None of them kissed like Ange. She made her whole mouth soft, like the inside of a ripe piece of fruit, and she didn't jam her tongue in my mouth, but slid it in there, and sucked my lips into her mouth at the same time, so it was like my mouth and hers were merging. I heard myself moan and I grabbed her and squeezed her harder.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowly, gently, we lowered ourselves to the grass. We lay on our sides and clutched each other, kissing and kissing. The world disappeared so there was only the kiss.</p>
<p class="calibre1">My hands found her butt, her waist. The edge of her t-shirt. Her warm tummy, her soft navel. They inched higher. She moaned too.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not here," she said. "Let's move over there." She pointed across the street at the big white church that gives Mission Dolores Park and the Mission its name. Holding hands, moving quickly, we crossed to the church. It had big pillars in front of it. She put my back up against one of them and pulled my face down to hers again. My hands went quickly and boldly back to her shirt. I slipped them up her front.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It undoes in the back," she whispered into my mouth. I had a boner that could cut glass. I moved my hands around to her back, which was strong and broad, and found the hook with my fingers, which were trembling. I fumbled for a while, thinking of all those jokes about how bad guys are at undoing bras. I was bad at it. Then the hook sprang free. She gasped into my mouth. I slipped my hands around, feeling the wetness of her armpits -- which was sexy and not at all gross for some reason -- and then brushed the sides of her breasts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That's when the sirens started.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They were louder than anything I'd ever heard. A sound like a physical sensation, like something blowing you off your feet. A sound as loud as your ears could process, and then louder.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"DISPERSE IMMEDIATELY," a voice said, like God rattling in my skull.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"THIS IS AN ILLEGAL GATHERING. DISPERSE IMMEDIATELY."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The band had stopped playing. The noise of the crowd across the street changed. It got scared. Angry.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I heard a click as the PA system of car-speakers and car-batteries in the tennis courts powered up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"TAKE IT BACK!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a defiant yell, like a sound shouted into the surf or screamed off a cliff.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"TAKE IT BACK!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The crowd <i class="calibre6">growled</i>, a sound that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"<i class="calibre6">TAKE IT BACK</i>!" they chanted. "TAKE IT BACK TAKE IT BACK TAKE IT BACK!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The police moved in in lines, carrying plastic shields, wearing Darth Vader helmets that covered their faces. Each one had a black truncheon and infra-red goggles. They looked like soldiers out of some futuristic war movie. They took a step forward in unison and every one of them banged his truncheon on his shield, a cracking noise like the earth splitting. Another step, another crack. They were all around the park and closing in now.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"DISPERSE IMMEDIATELY," the voice of God said again. There were helicopters overhead now. No floodlights, though. The infrared goggles, right. Of course. They'd have infrared scopes in the sky, too. I pulled Ange back against the doorway of the church, tucking us back from the cops and the choppers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"TAKE IT BACK!" the PA roared. It was Trudy Doo's rebel yell and I heard her guitar thrash out some chords, then her drummer playing, then that big deep bass.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"TAKE IT BACK!" the crowd answered, and they boiled out of the park at the police lines.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I've never been in a war, but now I think I know what it must be like. What it must be like when scared kids charge across a field at an opposing force, knowing what's coming, running anyway, screaming, hollering.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"DISPERSE IMMEDIATELY," the voice of God said. It was coming from trucks parked all around the park, trucks that had swung into place in the last few seconds.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That's when the mist fell. It came out of the choppers, and we just caught the edge of it. It made the top of my head feel like it was going to come off. It made my sinuses feel like they were being punctured with ice-picks. It made my eyes swell and water, and my throat close.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pepper spray. Not 200 thousand Scovilles. A million and a half. They'd gassed the crowd.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I didn't see what happened next, but I heard it, over the sound of both me and Ange choking and holding each other. First the choking, retching sounds. The guitar and drums and bass crashed to a halt. Then coughing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then screaming.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The screaming went on for a long time. When I could see again, the cops had their scopes up on their foreheads and the choppers were flooding Dolores Park with so much light it looked like daylight. Everyone was looking at the Park, which was good news, because when the lights went up like that, we were totally visible.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What do we do?" Ange said. Her voice was tight, scared. I didn't trust myself to speak for a moment. I swallowed a few times.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"We walk away," I said. "That's all we can do. Walk away. Like we were just passing by. Down to Dolores and turn left and up towards 16th Street. Like we're just passing by. Like this is none of our business."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That'll never work," she said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's all I've got."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You don't think we should try to run for it?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No," I said. "If we run, they'll chase us. Maybe if we walk, they'll figure we haven't done anything and let us alone. They have a lot of arrests to make. They'll be busy for a long time."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The park was rolling with bodies, people and adults clawing at their faces and gasping. The cops dragged them by the armpits, then lashed their wrists with plastic cuffs and tossed them into the trucks like rag-dolls.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"OK?" I said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"OK," she said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And that's just what we did. Walked, holding hands, quickly and business-like, like two people wanting to avoid whatever trouble someone else was making. The kind of walk you adopt when you want to pretend you can't see a panhandler, or don't want to get involved in a street-fight.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It worked.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We reached the corner and turned and kept going. Neither of us dared to speak for two blocks. Then I let out a gasp of air I hadn't know I'd been holding in.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We came to 16th Street and turned down toward Mission Street. Normally that's a pretty scary neighborhood at 2AM on a Saturday night. That night it was a relief -- same old druggies and hookers and dealers and drunks. No cops with truncheons, no gas.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Um," I said as we breathed in the night air. "Coffee?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Home," she said. "I think home for now. Coffee later."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah," I agreed. She lived up in Hayes Valley. I spotted a taxi rolling by and I hailed it. That was a small miracle -- there are hardly any cabs when you need them in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Have you got cabfare home?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah," she said. The cab-driver looked at us through his window. I opened the back door so he wouldn't take off.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good night," I said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She put her hands behind my head and pulled my face toward her. She kissed me hard on the mouth, nothing sexual in it, but somehow more intimate for that.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good night," she whispered in my ear, and slipped into the taxi.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Head swimming, eyes running, a burning shame for having left all those Xnetters to the tender mercies of the DHS and the SFPD, I set off for home.</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">Monday morning, Fred Benson was standing behind Ms Galvez's desk.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ms Galvez will no longer be teaching this class," he said, once we'd taken our seats. He had a self-satisfied note that I recognized immediately. On a hunch, I checked out Charles. He was smiling like it was his birthday and he'd been given the best present in the world.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I put my hand up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why not?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's Board policy not to discuss employee matters with anyone except the employee and the disciplinary committee," he said, without even bothering to hide how much he enjoyed saying it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"We'll be beginning a new unit today, on national security. Your SchoolBooks have the new texts. Please open them and turn to the first screen."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The opening screen was emblazoned with a DHS logo and the title: WHAT EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD KNOW ABOUT HOMELAND SECURITY.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I wanted to throw my SchoolBook on the floor.</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">I'd made arrangements to meet Ange at a cafe in her neighborhood after school. I jumped on the BART and found myself sitting behind two guys in suits. They were looking at the San Francisco Chronicle, which featured a full-page post-mortem on the "youth riot" in Mission Dolores Park. They were tutting and clucking over it. Then one said to the other, "It's like they're brainwashed or something. Christ, were we ever that stupid?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I got up and moved to another seat.</p>
<p class="c3">Chapter 13</p>
<p class="c5">This chapter is dedicated to Books-A-Million, a chain of gigantic bookstores spread across the USA. I first encountered Books-A-Million while staying at a hotel in Terre Haute, Indiana (I was giving a speech at the Rose Hulman Institute of Technology later that day). The store was next to my hotel and I really needed some reading material -- I'd been on the road for a solid month and I'd read everything in my suitcase, and I had another five cities to go before I headed home. As I stared intently at the shelves, a clerk asked me if I needed any help. Now, I've worked at bookstores before, and a knowledgeable clerk is worth her weight in gold, so I said sure, and started to describe my tastes, naming authors I'd enjoyed. The clerk smiled and said, "I've got just the book for you," and proceeded to take down a copy of my first novel, Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom. I busted out laughing, introduced myself, and had an absolutely lovely chat about science fiction that almost made me late to give my speech!</p>
<p class="c5"><a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Books-A-Million</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">"They're total whores," Ange said, spitting the word out. "In fact, that's an insult to hardworking whores everywhere. They're, they're <i class="calibre6">profiteers</i>."</p>
<p class="calibre1">We were looking at a stack of newspapers we'd picked up and brought to the cafe. They all contained "reporting" on the party in Dolores Park and to a one, they made it sound like a drunken, druggy orgy of kids who'd attacked the cops. <i class="calibre6">USA Today</i> described the cost of the "riot" and included the cost of washing away the pepper-spray residue from the gas-bombing, the rash of asthma attacks that clogged the city's emergency rooms, and the cost of processing the eight hundred arrested "rioters."</p>
<p class="calibre1">No one was telling our side.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, the Xnet got it right, anyway," I said. I'd saved a bunch of the blogs and videos and photostreams to my phone and I showed them to her. They were first-hand accounts from people who'd been gassed, and beaten up. The video showed us all dancing, having fun, showed the peaceful political speeches and the chant of "Take It Back" and Trudy Doo talking about us being the only generation that could believe in fighting for our freedoms.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"We need to make people know about this," she said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah," I said, glumly. "That's a nice theory."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, why do you think the press doesn't ever publish our side?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You said it, they're whores."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah, but whores do it for the money. They could sell more papers and commercials if they had a controversy. All they have now is a crime -- controversy is much bigger."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"OK, point taken. So why don't they do it? Well, reporters can barely search regular blogs, let alone keep track of the Xnet. It's not as if that's a real adult-friendly place to be."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah," she said. "Well, we can fix that, right?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Write it all up. Put it in one place, with all the links. A single place where you can go that's intended for the press to find it and get the whole picture. Link it to the HOWTOs for Xnet. Internet users can get to the Xnet, provided they don't care about the DHS finding out what they've been surfing."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You think it'll work?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, even if it doesn't, it's something positive to do."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why would they listen to us, anyway?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who wouldn't listen to M1k3y?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I put down my coffee. I picked up my phone and slipped it into my pocket. I stood up, turned on my heel, and walked out of the cafe. I picked a direction at random and kept going. My face felt tight, the blood gone into my stomach, which churned.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre6">They know who you are,</i> I thought. <i class="calibre6">They know who M1k3y is.</i> That was it. If Ange had figured it out, the DHS had too. I was doomed. I had known that since they let me go from the DHS truck, that someday they'd come and arrest me and put me away forever, send me to wherever Darryl had gone.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was all over.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She nearly tackled me as I reached Market Street. She was out of breath and looked furious.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What the <i class="calibre6">hell</i> is your problem, mister?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I shook her off and kept walking. It was all over.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She grabbed me again. "Stop it, Marcus, you're scaring me. Come on, talk to me."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I stopped and looked at her. She blurred before my eyes. I couldn't focus on anything. I had a mad desire to jump into the path of a Muni trolley as it tore past us, down the middle of the road. Better to die than to go back.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Marcus!" She did something I'd only seen people do in the movies. She slapped me, a hard crack across the face. "Talk to me, dammit!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I looked at her and put my hand to my face, which was stinging hard.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No one is supposed to know who I am," I said. "I can't put it any more simply. If you know, it's all over. Once other people know, it's all over."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh god, I'm sorry. Look, I only know because, well, because I blackmailed Jolu. After the party I stalked you a little, trying to figure out if you were the nice guy you seemed to be or a secret axe-murderer. I've known Jolu for a long time and when I asked him about you, he gushed like you were the Second Coming or something, but I could hear that there was something he wasn't telling me. I've known Jolu for a long time. He dated my older sister at computer camp when he was a kid. I have some really good dirt on him. I told him I'd go public with it if he didn't tell me."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So he told you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No," she said. "He told me to go to hell. Then I told him something about me. Something I'd never told anyone else."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked at me. Looked around. Looked back at me. "OK. I won't swear you to secrecy because what's the point? Either I can trust you or I can't.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Last year, I --" she broke off. "Last year, I stole the standardized tests and published them on the net. It was just a lark. I happened to be walking past the principal's office and I saw them in his safe, and the door was hanging open. I ducked into his office -- there were six sets of copies and I just put one into my bag and took off again. When I got home, I scanned them all and put them up on a Pirate Party server in Denmark."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That was <i class="calibre6">you</i>?" I said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She blushed. "Um. Yeah."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Holy crap!" I said. It had been huge news. The Board of Education said that its No Child Left Behind tests had cost tens of millions of dollars to produce and that they'd have to spend it all over again now that they'd had the leak. They called it "edu-terrorism." The news had speculated endlessly about the political motivations of the leaker, wondering if it was a teacher's protest, or a student, or a thief, or a disgruntled government contractor.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That was YOU?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It was me," she said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"And you told Jolu this --"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Because I wanted him to be sure that I would keep the secret. If he knew <i class="calibre6">my</i> secret, then he'd have something he could use to put me in jail if I opened my trap. Give a little, get a little. Quid pro quo, like in Silence of the Lambs."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"And he told you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No," she said. "He didn't."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But --"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then I told him how into you I was. How I was planning to totally make an idiot of myself and throw myself at you. <i class="calibre6">Then</i> he told me."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I couldn't think of anything to say then. I looked down at my toes. She grabbed my hands and squeezed them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry I squeezed it out of him. It was your decision to tell me, if you were going to tell me at all. I had no business --"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No," I said. Now that I knew how she'd found out, I was starting to calm down. "No, it's good you know. <i class="calibre6">You</i>."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Me," she said. "Li'l ol' me."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"OK, I can live with this. But there's one other thing."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"There's no way to say this without sounding like a jerk, so I'll just say it. People who date each other -- or whatever it is we're doing now -- they split up. When they split up, they get angry at each other. Sometimes even hate each other. It's really cold to think about that happening between us, but you know, we've got to think about it."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I solemnly promise that there is nothing you could ever do to me that would cause me to betray your secret. Nothing. Screw a dozen cheerleaders in my bed while my mother watches. Make me listen to Britney Spears. Rip off my laptop, smash it with hammers and soak it in sea-water. I promise. Nothing. Ever."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I whooshed out some air.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Um," I said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now would be a good time to kiss me," she said, and turned her face up.</p>

<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">M1k3y's next big project on the Xnet was putting together the ultimate roundup of reports of the DON'T TRUST party at Dolores Park. I put together the biggest, most bad-ass site I could, with sections showing the action by location, by time, by category -- police violence, dancing, aftermath, singing. I uploaded the whole concert.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was pretty much all I worked on for the rest of the night. And the next night. And the next.</p>
<p class="calibre1">My mailbox overflowed with suggestions from people. They sent me dumps off their phones and their pocket-cameras. Then I got an email from a name I recognized -- Dr Eeevil (three "e"s), one of the prime maintainers of ParanoidLinux.</p>
<p class="western26">&gt; M1k3y</p>
<p class="western27"/>
<p class="western26">&gt; I have been watching your Xnet experiment with great interest. Here in Germany, we have much experience with what happens with a government that gets out of control.</p>
<p class="western27"/>
<p class="western26">&gt; One thing you should know is that every camera has a unique "noise signature" that can be used to later connect a picture with a camera. That means that the photos you're republishing on your site could potentially be used to identify the photographers, should they later be picked up for something else.</p>
<p class="western27"/>
<p class="western26">&gt; Luckily, it's not hard to strip out the signatures, if you care to. There's a utility on the ParanoidLinux distro you're using that does this -- it's called photonomous, and you'll find it in /usr/bin. Just read the man pages for documentation. It's simple though.</p>
<p class="western27"/>
<p class="western26">&gt; Good luck with what you're doing. Don't get caught. Stay free. Stay paranoid.</p>
<p class="western27"/>
<p class="western26">&gt; Dr Eeevil</p>
<p class="western27"/>
<p class="calibre1">I de-fingerprintized all the photos I'd posted and put them back up, along with a note explaining what Dr Eeevil had told me, warning everyone else to do the same. We all had the same basic ParanoidXbox install, so we could all anonymize our pictures. There wasn't anything I could do about the photos that had already been downloaded and cached, but from now on we'd be smarter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That was all the thought I gave the matter that night, until I got down to breakfast the next morning and Mom had the radio on, playing the NPR morning news.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Arabic news agency Al-Jazeera is running pictures, video and first-hand accounts of last weekend's youth riot in Mission Dolores park," the announcer said as I was drinking a glass of orange juice. I managed not to spray it across the room, but I <i class="calibre6">did</i> choke a little.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Al-Jazeera reporters claim that these accounts were published on the so-called 'Xnet,' a clandestine network used by students and Al-Quaeda sympathizers in the Bay Area. This network's existence has long been rumored, but today marks its first mainstream mention."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom shook her head. "Just what we need," she said. "As if the police weren't bad enough. Kids running around, pretending to be guerrillas and giving them the excuse to really crack down."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The Xnet weblogs have carried hundreds of reports and multimedia files from young people who attended the riot and allege that they were gathered peacefully until the police attacked <i class="calibre6">them</i>. Here is one of those accounts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"'All we were doing was dancing. I brought my little brother. Bands played and we talked about freedom, about how we were losing it to these jerks who say they hate terrorists but who attack us though we're not terrorists we're Americans. I think they hate freedom, not us.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"We danced and the bands played and it was all fun and good and then the cops started shouting at us to disperse. We all shouted take it back! Meaning take America back. The cops gassed us with pepper spray. My little brother is twelve. He missed three days of school. My stupid parents say it was my fault. How about the police? We pay them and they're supposed to protect us but they gassed us for no good reason, gassed us like they gas enemy soldiers.'</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Similar accounts, including audio and video, can be found on Al-Jazeera's website and on the Xnet. You can find directions for accessing this Xnet on NPR's homepage."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad came down.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do you use the Xnet?" he said. He looked intensely at my face. I felt myself squirm.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's for video-games," I said. "That's what most people use it for. It's just a wireless network. It's what everyone did with those free Xboxes they gave away last year."</p>
<p class="calibre1">He glowered at me. "Games? Marcus, you don't realize it, but you're providing cover for people who plan on attacking and destroying this country. I don't want to see you using this Xnet. Not anymore. Do I make myself clear?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I wanted to argue. Hell, I wanted to shake him by the shoulders. But I didn't. I looked away. I said, "Sure, Dad." I went to school.</p>
<p class="western8">#</p>
<p class="western8"/>
<p class="calibre1">At first I was relieved when I discovered that they weren't going to leave Mr Benson in charge of my social studies class. But the woman they found to replace him was my worst nightmare.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She was young, just about 28 or 29, and pretty, in a wholesome kind of way. She was blonde and spoke with a soft southern accent when she introduced herself to us as Mrs Andersen. That set off alarm bells right away. I didn't know <i class="calibre6">any</i> women under the age of sixty that called themselves "Mrs."</p>
<p class="calibre1">But I was prepared to overlook it. She was young, pretty, she sounded nice. She would be OK.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She wasn't OK.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Under what circumstances should the federal government be prepared to suspend the Bill of Rights?" she said, turning to the blackboard and writing down a row of numbers, one through ten.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Never," I said, not waiting to be called on. This was easy. "Constitutional rights are absolute."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's not a very sophisticated view." She looked at her seating-plan. "Marcus. For example, say a policeman conducts an improper search -- he goes beyond the stuff specified in his warrant. He discovers compelling evidence that a bad guy killed your father. It's the only evidence that exists. Should the bad guy go free?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I knew the answer to this, but I couldn't really explain it. "Yes," I said, finally. "But the police shouldn't conduct improper searches --"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wrong," she said. "The proper response to police misconduct is disciplinary action against the police, not punishing all of society for one cop's mistake." She wrote "Criminal guilt" under point one on the board.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Other ways in which the Bill of Rights can be superseded?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Charles put his hand up. "Shouting fire in a crowded theater?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Very good --" she consulted the seating plan -- "Charles. There are many instances in which the First Amendment is not absolute. Let's list some more of those."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Charles put his hand up again. "Endangering a law enforcement officer."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, disclosing the identity of an undercover policeman or intelligence officer. Very good." She wrote it down. "Others?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"National security," Charles said, not waiting for her to call on him again. "Libel. Obscenity. Corruption of minors. Child porn. Bomb-making recipes." Mrs Andersen wrote these down fast, but stopped at child porn. "Child porn is just a form of obscenity."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was feeling sick. This was not what I'd learned or believed about my country. I put my hand up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, Marcus?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't get it. You're making it sound like the Bill of Rights is optional. It's the Constitution. We're supposed to follow it absolutely."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's a common oversimplification," she said, giving me a fake smile. "But the fact of the matter is that the framers of the Constitution intended it to be a living document that was revised over time. They understood that the Republic wouldn't be able to last forever if the government of the day couldn't govern according to the needs of the day. They never intended the Constitution to be looked on like religious doctrine. After all, they came here fleeing religious doctrine."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I shook my head. "What? No. They were merchants and artisans who were loyal to the King until he instituted policies that were against their interests and enforced them brutally. The religious refugees were way earlier."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Some of the Framers were descended from religious refugees," she said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"And the Bill of Rights isn't supposed to be something you pick and choose from. What the Framers hated was tyranny. That's what the Bill of Rights is supposed to prevent. They were a revolutionary army and they wanted a set of principles that everyone could agree to. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The right of people to throw off their oppressors."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, yes," she said, waving at me. "They believed in the right of people to get rid of their Kings, but --" Charles was grinning and when she said that, he smiled even wider.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"They set out the Bill of Rights because they thought that having absolute rights was better than the risk that someone would take them away. Like the First Amendment: it's supposed to protect us by preventing the government from creating two kinds of speech, allowed speech and criminal speech. They didn't want to face the risk that some jerk would decide that the things that he found unpleasant were illegal."</p>
<p class="calibre1">She turned and wrote, "Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" on it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"We're getting a little ahead of the lesson, but you seem like an advanced group." The others laughed at this, nervously.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The role of government is to secure for citizens the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. In that order. It's like a filter. If the government wants to do something that makes us a little unhappy, or takes away some of our liberty, it's OK, providing they're doing it to save our lives. That's why the cops can lock you up if they think you're a danger to yourself or others. You lose your liberty and happiness to protect life. If you've got life, you might get liberty and happiness later."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of the others had their hands up. "Doesn't that mean that they can do anything they want, if they say it's to stop someone from hurting us in the future?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah," another kid said. "This sounds like you're saying that national security is more important than the Constitution."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was so proud of my fellow students then. I said, "How can you protect freedom by suspending the Bill of Rights?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">She shook her head at us like we were being very stupid. "The 'revolutionary' founding fathers <i class="calibre6">shot traitors</i> and spies. They didn't believe in absolute freedom, not when it threatened the Republic. Now you take these Xnet people --"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I tried hard not to stiffen.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"-- these so-called jammers who were on the news this morning. After this city was attacked by people who've declared war on this country, they set about sabotaging the security measures set up to catch the bad guys and prevent them from doing it again. They did this by endangering and inconveniencing their fellow citizens --"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"They did it to show that our rights were being taken away in the name of protecting them!" I said. OK, I shouted. God, she had me so steamed. "They did it because the government was treating <i class="calibre6">everyone</i> like a suspected terrorist."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So they wanted to prove that they shouldn't be treated like terrorists," Charles shouted back, "so they acted like terrorists? So they committed terrorism?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I boiled.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh for Christ's sake. Committed terrorism? They showed that universal surveillance was more dangerous than terrorism. Look at what happened in the park last weekend. Those people were dancing and listening to music. How is <i class="calibre6">that</i> terrorism?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The teacher crossed the room and stood before me, looming over me until I shut up. "Marcus, you seem to think that nothing has changed in this country. You need to understand that the bombing of the Bay Bridge changed everything. Thousands of our friends and relatives lie dead at the bottom of the Bay. This is a time for national unity in the face of the violent insult our country has suffered --"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I stood up. I'd had enough of this "everything has changed" crapola. "National unity? The whole point of America is that we're the country where dissent is welcome. We're a country of dissidents and fighters and university dropouts and free speech people."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I thought of Ms Galvez's last lesson and the thousands of Berkeley students who'd surrounded the police-van when they tried to arrest a guy for distributing civil rights literature. No one tried to stop those trucks when they drove away with all the people who'd been dancing in the park. I didn't try. I was running away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe everything <i class="calibre6">had</i> changed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I believe you know where Mr Benson's office is," she said to me. "You are to present yourself to him immediately. I will <i class="calibre6">not</i> have my classes disrupted by disrespectful behavior. For someone who claims to love freedom of speech, you're certainly willing to shout down anyone who disagrees with you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I picked up my SchoolBook and my bag and stormed out. The door had a gas-lift, so it was impossible to slam, or I would have slammed it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I went fast to Mr Benson's office. Cameras filmed me as I went. My gait was recorded. The arphids in my student ID broadcast my identity to sensors in the hallway. It was like being in jail.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Close the door, Marcus," Mr Benson said. He turned his screen around so that I could see the video feed from the social studies classroom. He'd been watching.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What do you have to say for yourself?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That wasn't teaching, it was <i class="calibre6">propaganda</i>. She told us that the Constitution didn't matter!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, she said it wasn't religious doctrine. And you attacked her like some kind of fundamentalist, proving her point. Marcus, you of all people should understand that everything changed when the bridge was bombed. Your friend Darryl --"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't you say a goddamned word about him," I said, the anger bubbling over. "You're not fit to talk about him. Yeah, I understand that everything's different now. We used to be a free country. Now we're not."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Marcus, do you know what 'zero-tolerance' means?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I backed down. He could expel me for "threatening behavior." It was supposed to be used against gang kids who tried to intimidate their teachers. But of course he wouldn't have any compunctions about using it on me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes," I said. "I know what it means."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I think you owe me an apology," he said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I looked at him. He was barely suppressing his sadistic smile. A part of me wanted to grovel. It wanted to beg for his forgiveness for all my shame. I tamped that part down and decided that I would rather get kicked out than apologize.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness." I remembered it word for word.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He shook his head. "Remembering things isn't the same as understanding them, sonny." He bent over his computer and made some clicks. His printer purred. He handed me a sheet of warm Board letterhead that said I'd been suspended for two weeks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll email your parents now. If you are still on school property in thirty minutes, you'll be arrested for trespassing."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I looked at him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You don't want to declare war on me in my own school," he said. "You can't win that war. GO!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I left.</p>
<p class="c3">Chapter 14</p>
<p class="c5">This chapter is dedicated to the incomparable Mysterious Galaxy in San Diego, California. The Mysterious Galaxy folks have had me in to sign books every time I've been in San Diego for a conference or to teach (the Clarion Writers' Workshop is based at UC San Diego in nearby La Jolla, CA), and every time I show up, they pack the house. This is a store with a loyal following of die-hard fans who know that they'll always be able to get great recommendations and great ideas at the store. In summer 2007, I took my writing class from Clarion down to the store for the midnight launch of the final Harry Potter book and I've never seen such a rollicking, awesomely fun party at a store.</p>
<p class="c5"><a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Mysterious Galaxy</a>: 7051 Clairemont Mesa Blvd., Suite #302 San Diego, CA USA 92111 +1 858 268 4747</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Xnet wasn't much fun in the middle of the school-day, when all the people who used it were in school. I had the piece of paper folded in the back pocket of my jeans, and I threw it on the kitchen table when I got home. I sat down in the living room and switched on the TV. I never watched it, but I knew that my parents did. The TV and the radio and the newspapers were where they got all their ideas about the world.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The news was terrible. There were so many reasons to be scared. American soldiers were dying all over the world. Not just soldiers, either. National guardsmen, who thought they were signing up to help rescue people from hurricanes, stationed overseas for years and years of a long and endless war.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I flipped around the 24-hour news networks, one after another, a parade of officials telling us why we should be scared. A parade of photos of bombs going off around the world.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I kept flipping and found myself looking at a familiar face. It was the guy who had come into the truck and spoken to Severe-Haircut woman when I was chained up in the back. Wearing a military uniform. The caption identified him as Major General Graeme Sutherland, Regional Commander, DHS.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I hold in my hands actual literature on offer at the so-called concert in Dolores Park last weekend." He held up a stack of pamphlets. There'd been lots of pamphleteers there, I remembered. Wherever you got a group of people in San Francisco, you got pamphlets.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I want you to look at these for a moment. Let me read you their titles. WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED: A CITIZEN'S GUIDE TO OVERTHROWING THE STATE. Here's one, DID THE SEPTEMBER 11TH BOMBINGS REALLY HAPPEN? And another, HOW TO USE THEIR SECURITY AGAINST THEM. This literature shows us the true purpose of the illegal gathering on Saturday night. This wasn't merely an unsafe gathering of thousands of people without proper precaution, or even toilets. It was a recruiting rally for the enemy. It was an attempt to corrupt children into embracing the idea that America shouldn't protect herself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Take this slogan, DON'T TRUST ANYONE OVER 25. What better way to ensure that no considered, balanced, adult discussion is ever injected into your pro-terrorist message than to exclude adults, limiting your group to impressionable young people?</p>
<p class="calibre1">"When police came on the scene, they found a recruitment rally for America's enemies in progress. The gathering had already disrupted the nights of hundreds of residents in the area, none of whom had been consulted in the planning of this all night rave party.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"They ordered these people to disperse -- that much is visible on all the video -- and when the revelers turned to attack them, egged on by the musicians on stage, the police subdued them using non-lethal crowd control techniques.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The arrestees were ring-leaders and provocateurs who had led the thousands of impressionistic young people there to charge the police lines. 827 of them were taken into custody. Many of these people had prior offenses. More than 100 of them had outstanding warrants. They are still in custody.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ladies and gentlemen, America is fighting a war on many fronts, but nowhere is she in more grave danger than she is here, at home. Whether we are being attacked by terrorists or those who sympathize with them."</p>
<p class="calibre1">A reporter held up a hand and said, "General Sutherland, surely you're not saying that these children were terrorist sympathizers for attending a party in a park?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of course not. But when young people are brought under the influence of our country's enemies, it's easy for them to end up over their heads. Terrorists would love to recruit a fifth column to fight the war on the home front for them. If these were my children, I'd be gravely concerned."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another reporter chimed in. "Surely this is just an open air concert, General? They were hardly drilling with rifles."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The General produced a stack of photos and began to hold them up. "These are pictures that officers took with infra-red cameras before moving in." He held them next to his face and paged through them one at a time. They showed people dancing really rough, some people getting crushed or stepped on. Then they moved into sex stuff by the trees, a girl with three guys, two guys necking together. "There were children as young as ten years old at this event. A deadly cocktail of drugs, propaganda and music resulted in dozens of injuries. It's a wonder there weren't any deaths."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I switched the TV off. They made it look like it had been a riot. If my parents thought I'd been there, they'd have strapped me to my bed for a month and only let me out afterward wearing a tracking collar.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Speaking of which, they were going to be <i class="calibre6">pissed</i> when they found out I'd been suspended.</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">They didn't take it well. Dad wanted to ground me, but Mom and I talked him out of it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You know that vice-principal has had it in for Marcus for years," Mom said. "The last time we met him you cursed him for an hour afterward. I think the word 'asshole' was mentioned repeatedly."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad shook his head. "Disrupting a class to argue against the Department of Homeland Security --"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's a social studies class, Dad," I said. I was beyond caring anymore, but I felt like if Mom was going to stick up for me, I should help her out. "We were talking about the DHS. Isn't debate supposed to be healthy?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Look, son," he said. He'd taken to calling me "son" a lot. It made me feel like he'd stopped thinking of me as a person and switched to thinking of me as a kind of half-formed larva that needed to be guided out of adolescence. I hated it. "You're going to have to learn to live with the fact that we live in a different world today. You have every right to speak your mind of course, but you have to be prepared for the consequences of doing so. You have to face the fact that there are people who are hurting, who aren't going to want to argue the finer points of Constitutional law when their lives are at stake. We're in a lifeboat now, and once you're in the lifeboat, no one wants to hear about how mean the captain is being."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I barely restrained myself from rolling my eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've been assigned two weeks of independent study, writing one paper for each of my subjects, using the city for my background -- a history paper, a social studies paper, an English paper, a physics paper. It beats sitting around at home watching television."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad looked hard at me, like he suspected I was up to something, then nodded. I said goodnight to them and went up to my room. I fired up my Xbox and opened a word-processor and started to brainstorm ideas for my papers. Why not? It really was better than sitting around at home.</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">I ended up IMing with Ange for quite a while that night. She was sympathetic about everything and told me she'd help me with my papers if I wanted to meet her after school the next night. I knew where her school was -- she went to the same school as Van -- and it was all the way over in the East Bay, where I hadn't visited since the bombs went.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was really excited at the prospect of seeing her again. Every night since the party, I'd gone to bed thinking of two things: the sight of the crowd charging the police lines and the feeling of the side of her breast under her shirt as we leaned against the pillar. She was amazing. I'd never been with a girl as...aggressive as her before. It had always been me putting the moves on and them pushing me away. I got the feeling that Ange was as much of a horn-dog as I was. It was a tantalizing notion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I slept soundly that night, with exciting dreams of me and Ange and what we might do if we found ourselves in a secluded spot somewhere.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next day, I set out to work on my papers. San Francisco is a good place to write about. History? Sure, it's there, from the Gold Rush to the WWII shipyards, the Japanese internment camps, the invention of the PC. Physics? The Exploratorium has the coolest exhibits of any museum I've ever been to. I took a perverse satisfaction in the exhibits on soil liquefaction during big quakes. English? Jack London, Beat Poets, science fiction writers like Pat Murphy and Rudy Rucker. Social studies? The Free Speech Movement, Cesar Chavez, gay rights, feminism, anti-war movement...</p>
<p class="calibre1">I've always loved just learning stuff for its own sake. Just to be smarter about the world around me. I could do that just by walking around the city. I decided I'd do an English paper about the Beats first. City Lights books had a great library in an upstairs room where Alan Ginsberg and his buddies had created their radical druggy poetry. The one we'd read in English class was <i class="calibre6">Howl</i> and I would never forget the opening lines, they gave me shivers down my back:</p>
<p class="c5">I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,</p>
<p class="c5">dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix,</p>
<p class="c5">angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night...</p>
<p class="calibre1">I liked the way he ran those words all together, "starving hysterical naked." I knew how that felt. And "best minds of my generation" made me think hard too. It made me remember the park and the police and the gas falling. They busted Ginsberg for obscenity over Howl -- all about a line about gay sex that would hardly have caused us to blink an eye today. It made me happy somehow, knowing that we'd made some progress. That things had been even more restrictive than this before.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I lost myself in the library, reading these beautiful old editions of the books. I got lost in Jack Kerouac's <i class="calibre6">On the Road</i>, a novel I'd been meaning to read for a long time, and a clerk who came up to check on me nodded approvingly and found me a cheap edition that he sold me for six bucks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I walked into Chinatown and had dim sum buns and noodles with hot-sauce that I had previously considered to be pretty hot, but which would never seem anything like hot ever again, not now that I'd had an Ange special.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As the day wore on toward the afternoon, I got on the BART and switched to a San Mateo bridge shuttle bus to bring me around to the East Bay. I read my copy of <i class="calibre6">On the Road</i> and dug the scenery whizzing past. <i class="calibre6">On the Road</i> is a semi-autobiographical novel about Jack Kerouac, a druggy, hard-drinking writer who goes hitchhiking around America, working crummy jobs, howling through the streets at night, meeting people and parting ways. Hipsters, sad-faced hobos, con-men, muggers, scumbags and angels. There's not really a plot -- Kerouac supposedly wrote it in three weeks on a long roll of paper, stoned out of his mind -- only a bunch of amazing things, one thing happening after another. He makes friends with self-destructing people like Dean Moriarty, who get him involved in weird schemes that never really work out, but still it works out, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a rhythm to the words, it was luscious, I could hear it being read aloud in my head. It made me want to lie down in the bed of a pickup truck and wake up in a dusty little town somewhere in the central valley on the way to LA, one of those places with a gas station and a diner, and just walk out into the fields and meet people and see stuff and do stuff.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a long bus ride and I must have dozed off a little -- staying up late IMing with Ange was hard on my sleep-schedule, since Mom still expected me down for breakfast. I woke up and changed buses and before long, I was at Ange's school.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She came bounding out of the gates in her uniform -- I'd never seen her in it before, it was kind of cute in a weird way, and reminded me of Van in her uniform. She gave me a long hug and a hard kiss on the cheek.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hello you!" she said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hiya!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Whatcha reading?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I'd been waiting for this. I'd marked the passage with a finger. "Listen: 'They danced down the streets like dingledodies, and I shambled after as I've been doing all my life after people who interest me, because the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones that never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop and everybody goes "Awww!"'"</p>
<p class="calibre1">She took the book and read the passage again for herself. "Wow, dingledodies! I love it! Is it all like this?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I told her about the parts I'd read, walking slowly down the sidewalk back toward the bus-stop. Once we turned the corner, she put her arm around my waist and I slung mine around her shoulder. Walking down the street with a girl -- my girlfriend? Sure, why not? -- talking about this cool book. It was heaven. Made me forget my troubles for a little while.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Marcus?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I turned around. It was Van. In my subconscious I'd expected this. I knew because my conscious mind wasn't remotely surprised. It wasn't a big school, and they all got out at the same time. I hadn't spoken to Van in weeks, and those weeks felt like months. We used to talk every day.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, Van," I said. I suppressed the urge to take my arm off of Ange's shoulders. Van seemed surprised, but not angry, more ashen, shaken. She looked closely at the two of us.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Angela?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, Vanessa," Ange said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are you doing here?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I came out to get Ange," I said, trying to keep my tone neutral. I was suddenly embarrassed to be seen with another girl.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh," Van said. "Well, it was nice to see you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nice to see you too, Vanessa," Ange said, swinging me around, marching me back toward the bus-stop.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You know her?" Ange said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah, since forever."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Was she your girlfriend?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What? No! No way! We were just friends."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You <i class="calibre6">were</i> friends?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I felt like Van was walking right behind us, listening in, though at the pace we were walking, she would have to be jogging to keep up. I resisted the temptation to look over my shoulder for as long as possible, then I did. There were lots of girls from the school behind us, but no Van.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"She was with me and Jose-Luis and Darryl when we were arrested. We used to ARG together. The four of us, we were kind of best friends."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"And what happened?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I dropped my voice. "She didn't like the Xnet," I said. "She thought we would get into trouble. That I'd get other people into trouble."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"And that's why you stopped being friends?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"We just drifted apart."</p>
<p class="calibre1">We walked a few steps. "You weren't, you know, boyfriend/girlfriend friends?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No!" I said. My face was hot. I felt like I sounded like I was lying, even though I was telling the truth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ange jerked us to a halt and studied my face.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Were you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No! Seriously! Just friends. Darryl and her -- well, not quite, but Darryl was so into her. There was no way --"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But if Darryl hadn't been into her, you would have, huh?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, Ange, no. Please, just believe me and let it go. Vanessa was a good friend and we're not anymore, and that upsets me, but I was never into her that way, all right?</p>
<p class="calibre1">She slumped a little. "OK, OK. I'm sorry. I don't really get along with her is all. We've never gotten along in all the years we've known each other."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh ho, I thought. This would be how it came to be that Jolu knew her for so long and I never met her; she had some kind of thing with Van and he didn't want to bring her around.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She gave me a long hug and we kissed, and a bunch of girls passed us going <i class="calibre6">woooo</i> and we straightened up and headed for the bus-stop. Ahead of us walked Van, who must have gone past while we were kissing. I felt like a complete jerk.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, she was at the stop and on the bus and we didn't say a word to each other, and I tried to make conversation with Ange all the way, but it was awkward.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The plan was to stop for a coffee and head to Ange's place to hang out and "study," i.e. take turns on her Xbox looking at the Xnet. Ange's mom got home late on Tuesdays, which was her night for yoga class and dinner with her girls, and Ange's sister was going out with her boyfriend, so we'd have the place to ourselves. I'd been having pervy thoughts about it ever since we'd made the plan.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We got to her place and went straight to her room and shut the door. Her room was kind of a disaster, covered with layers of clothes and notebooks and parts of PCs that would dig into your stocking feet like caltrops. Her desk was worse than the floor, piled high with books and comics, so we ended up sitting on her bed, which was OK by me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The awkwardness from seeing Van had gone away somewhat and we got her Xbox up and running. It was in the center of a nest of wires, some going to a wireless antenna she'd hacked into it and stuck to the window so she could tune in the neighbors' WiFi. Some went to a couple of old laptop screens she'd turned into standalone monitors, balanced on stands and bristling with exposed electronics. The screens were on both bedside tables, which was an excellent setup for watching movies or IMing from bed -- she could turn the monitors sidewise and lie on her side and they'd be right-side-up, no matter which side she lay on.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We both knew what we were really there for, sitting side by side propped against the bedside table. I was trembling a little and super-conscious of the warmth of her leg and shoulder against mine, but I needed to go through the motions of logging into Xnet and seeing what email I'd gotten and so on.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was an email from a kid who liked to send in funny phone-cam videos of the DHS being really crazy -- the last one had been of them disassembling a baby's stroller after a bomb-sniffing dog had shown an interest in it, taking it apart with screwdrivers right on the street in the Marina while all these rich people walked past, staring at them and marveling at how weird it was.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I'd linked to the video and it had been downloaded like crazy. He'd hosted it on the Internet Archive's Alexandria mirror in Egypt, where they'd host anything for free so long as you'd put it under the Creative Commons license, which let anyone remix it and share it. The US archive -- which was down in the Presidio, only a few minutes away -- had been forced to take down all those videos in the name of national security, but the Alexandria archive had split away into its own organization and was hosting anything that embarrassed the USA.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This kid -- his handle was Kameraspie -- had sent me an even better video this time around. It was at the doorway to City Hall in Civic Center, a huge wedding cake of a building covered with statues in little archways and gilt leaves and trim. The DHS had a secure perimeter around the building, and Kameraspie's video showed a great shot of their checkpoint as a guy in an officer's uniform approached and showed his ID and put his briefcase on the X-ray belt.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was all OK until one of the DHS people saw something he didn't like on the X-ray. He questioned the General, who rolled his eyes and said something inaudible (the video had been shot from across the street, apparently with a homemade concealed zoom lens, so the audio was mostly of people walking past and traffic noises).</p>
<p class="calibre1">The General and the DHS guys got into an argument, and the longer they argued, the more DHS guys gathered around them. Finally, the General shook his head angrily and waved his finger at the DHS guy's chest and picked up his briefcase and started to walk away. The DHS guys shouted at him, but he didn't slow. His body language really said, "I am totally, utterly pissed."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then it happened. The DHS guys ran after the general. Kameraspie slowed the video down here, so we could see, in frame-by-frame slo-mo, the general half-turning, his face all like, "No freaking way are you about to tackle me," then changing to horror as three of the giant DHS guards slammed into him, knocking him sideways, then catching him at the middle, like a career-ending football tackle. The general -- middle aged, steely grey hair, lined and dignified face -- went down like a sack of potatoes and bounced twice, his face slamming off the sidewalk and blood starting out of his nose.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The DHS hog-tied the general, strapping him at ankles and wrists. The general was shouting now, really shouting, his face purpling under the blood streaming from his nose. Legs swished by in the tight zoom. Passing pedestrians looked at this guy in his uniform, getting tied up, and you could see from his face that this was the worst part, this was the ritual humiliation, the removal of dignity. The clip ended.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh my dear sweet Buddha," I said looking at the screen as it faded to black, starting the video again. I nudged Ange and showed her the clip. She watched wordless, jaw hanging down to her chest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Post that," she said. "Post that post that post that post that!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I posted it. I could barely type as I wrote it up, describing what I'd seen, adding a note to see if anyone could identify the military man in the video, if anyone knew anything about this.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I hit publish.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We watched the video. We watched it again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">My email pinged.</p>
<p class="western28">&gt; I totally recognize that dude -- you can find his bio on Wikipedia. He's General Claude Geist. He commanded the joint UN peacekeeping mission in Haiti.</p>
<p class="western29"/>
<p class="calibre1">I checked the bio. There was a picture of the general at a press conference, and notes about his role in the difficult Haiti mission. It was clearly the same guy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I updated the post.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Theoretically, this was Ange's and my chance to make out, but that wasn't what we ended up doing. We crawled the Xnet blogs, looking for more accounts of the DHS searching people, tackling people, invading them. This was a familiar task, the same thing I'd done with all the footage and accounts from the riots in the park. I started a new category on my blog for this, AbusesOfAuthority, and filed them away. Ange kept coming up with new search terms for me to try and by the time her mom got home, my new category had seventy posts, headlined by General Geist's City Hall takedown.</p>
