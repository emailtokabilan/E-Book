<p class="calibre1">"Not right now, I don't," Barbara said. "You can be anonymous if you'd like. Marcus, I asked you to tell me this story because I need to know how it plays with the story you told me about your friend Darryl and the note you showed me. I can see how it would be a good adjunct; I could pitch this as the origin of the Xnet. 'They made an enemy they'll never forget,' that sort of thing. But to be honest, I'd rather not have to tell that story if I don't have to.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'd rather have a nice clean tale about the secret prison on our doorstep, without having to argue about whether the prisoners there are the sort of people likely to walk out the doors and establish an underground movement bent on destabilizing the federal government. I'm sure you can understand that."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I did. If the Xnet was part of the story, some people would say, see, they need to put guys like that in jail or they'll start a riot.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is your show," I said. "I think you need to tell the world about Darryl. When you do that, it's going to tell the DHS that I've gone public and they're going to go after me. Maybe they'll figure out then that I'm involved with the Xnet. Maybe they'll connect me to M1k3y. I guess what I'm saying is, once you publish about Darryl, it's all over for me no matter what. I've made my peace with that."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"As good be hanged for a sheep as a lamb," she said. "Right. Well, that's settled. I want the two of you to tell me everything you can about the founding and operation of the Xnet, and then I want a demonstration. What do you use it for? Who else uses it? How did it spread? Who wrote the software? Everything."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"This'll take a while," Ange said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've got a while," Barbara said. She drank some coffee and ate a fake Oreo. "This could be the most important story of the War on Terror. This could be the story that topples the government. When you have a story like this, you take it very carefully."</p>
<p class="c3">Chapter 17</p>
<p class="c5">This chapter is dedicated to Waterstone's, the national UK bookselling chain. Waterstone's is a chain of stores, but each one has the feel of a great independent store, with tons of personality, great stock (especially audiobooks!), and knowledgeable staff.</p>
<p class="c5"><a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Waterstones</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">So we told her. I found it really fun, actually. Teaching people how to use technology is always exciting. It's so cool to watch people figure out how the technology around them can be used to make their lives better. Ange was great too -- we made an excellent team. We'd trade off explaining how it all worked. Barbara was pretty good at this stuff to begin with, of course.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It turned out that she'd covered the crypto wars, the period in the early nineties when civil liberties groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation fought for the right of Americans to use strong crypto. I dimly knew about that period, but Barbara explained it in a way that made me get goose-pimples.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It's unbelievable today, but there was a time when the government classed crypto as a munition and made it illegal for anyone to export or use it on national security grounds. Get that? We used to have illegal <i class="calibre6">math</i> in this country.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The National Security Agency were the real movers behind the ban. They had a crypto standard that they said was strong enough for bankers and their customers to use, but not so strong that the mafia would be able to keep its books secret from them. The standard, DES-56, was said to be practically unbreakable. Then one of EFF's millionaire co-founders built a $250,000 DES-56 cracker that could break the cipher in two hours.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Still the NSA argued that it should be able to keep American citizens from possessing secrets it couldn't pry into. Then EFF dealt its death-blow. In 1995, they represented a Berkeley mathematics grad student called Dan Bernstein in court. Bernstein had written a crypto tutorial that contained computer code that could be used to make a cipher stronger than DES-56. Millions of times stronger. As far as the NSA was concerned, that made his article into a weapon, and therefore unpublishable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, it may be hard to get a judge to understand crypto and what it means, but it turned out that the average Appeals Court judge isn't real enthusiastic about telling grad students what kind of articles they're allowed to write. The crypto wars ended with a victory for the good guys when the 9th Circuit Appellate Division Court ruled that code was a form of expression protected under the First Amendment -- "Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech." If you've ever bought something on the Internet, or sent a secret message, or checked your bank-balance, you used crypto that EFF legalized. Good thing, too: the NSA just isn't that smart. Anything they know how to crack, you can be sure that terrorists and mobsters can get around too.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Barbara had been one of the reporters who'd made her reputation from covering the issue. She'd cut her teeth covering the tail end of the civil rights movement in San Francisco, and she recognized the similarity between the fight for the Constitution in the real world and the fight in cyberspace.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So she got it. I don't think I could have explained this stuff to my parents, but with Barbara it was easy. She asked smart questions about our cryptographic protocols and security procedures, sometimes asking stuff I didn't know the answer to -- sometimes pointing out potential breaks in our procedure.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We plugged in the Xbox and got it online. There were four open WiFi nodes visible from the board room and I told it to change between them at random intervals. She got this too -- once you were actually plugged into the Xnet, it was just like being on the Internet, only some stuff was a little slower, and it was all anonymous and unsniffable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So now what?" I said as we wound down. I'd talked myself dry and I had a terrible acid feeling from the coffee. Besides, Ange kept squeezing my hand under the table in a way that made me want to break away and find somewhere private to finish making up for our first fight.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now I do journalism. You go away and I research all the things you've told me and try to confirm them to the extent that I can. I'll let you see what I'm going to publish and I'll let you know when it's going to go live. I'd prefer that you <i class="calibre6">not</i> talk about this with anyone else now, because I want the scoop and because I want to make sure that I get the story before it goes all muddy from press speculation and DHS spin.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I <i class="calibre6">will</i> have to call the DHS for comment before I go to press, but I'll do that in a way that protects you to whatever extent possible. I'll also be sure to let you know before that happens.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"One thing I need to be clear on: this isn't your story anymore. It's mine. You were very generous to give it to me and I'll try to repay the gift, but you don't get the right to edit anything out, to change it, or to stop me. This is now in motion and it won't stop. Do you understand that?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I hadn't thought about it in those terms but once she said it, it was obvious. It meant that I had launched and I wouldn't be able to recall the rocket. It was going to fall where it was aimed, or it would go off course, but it was in the air and couldn't be changed now. Sometime in the near future, I would stop being Marcus -- I would be a public figure. I'd be the guy who blew the whistle on the DHS.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I'd be a dead man walking.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I guess Ange was thinking along the same lines, because she'd gone a color between white and green.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's get out of here," she said.</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">Ange's mom and sister were out again, which made it easy to decide where we were going for the evening. It was past supper time, but my parents had known that I was meeting with Barbara and wouldn't give me any grief if I came home late.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When we got to Ange's, I had no urge to plug in my Xbox. I had had all the Xnet I could handle for one day. All I could think about was Ange, Ange, Ange. Living without Ange. Knowing Ange was angry with me. Ange never going to talk to me again. Ange never going to kiss me again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She'd been thinking the same. I could see it in her eyes as we shut the door to her bedroom and looked at each other. I was hungry for her, like you'd hunger for dinner after not eating for days. Like you'd thirst for a glass of water after playing soccer for three hours straight.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Like none of that. It was more. It was something I'd never felt before. I wanted to eat her whole, devour her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Up until now, she'd been the sexual one in our relationship. I'd let her set and control the pace. It was amazingly erotic to have <i class="calibre6">her</i> grab <i class="calibre6">me</i> and take off my shirt, drag my face to hers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But tonight I couldn't hold back. I wouldn't hold back.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The door clicked shut and I reached for the hem of her t-shirt and yanked, barely giving her time to lift her arms as I pulled it over her head. I tore my own shirt over my head, listening to the cotton crackle as the stitches came loose.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her eyes were shining, her mouth open, her breathing fast and shallow. Mine was too, my breath and my heart and my blood all roaring in my ears.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I took off the rest of our clothes with equal zest, throwing them into the piles of dirty and clean laundry on the floor. There were books and papers all over the bed and I swept them aside. We landed on the unmade bedclothes a second later, arms around one another, squeezing like we would pull ourselves right through one another. She moaned into my mouth and I made the sound back, and I felt her voice buzz in my vocal chords, a feeling more intimate than anything I'd ever felt before.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She broke away and reached for the bedstand. She yanked open the drawer and threw a white pharmacy bag on the bed before me. I looked inside. Condoms. Trojans. One dozen spermicidal. Still sealed. I smiled at her and she smiled back and I opened the box.</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">I'd thought about what it would be like for years. A hundred times a day I'd imagined it. Some days, I'd thought of practically nothing else.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was nothing like I expected. Parts of it were better. Parts of it were lots worse. While it was going on, it felt like an eternity. Afterwards, it seemed to be over in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Afterwards, I felt the same. But I also felt different. Something had changed between us.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was weird. We were both shy as we put our clothes on and puttered around the room, looking away, not meeting each other's eyes. I wrapped the condom in a kleenex from a box beside the bed and took it into the bathroom and wound it with toilet paper and stuck it deep into the trash-can.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When I came back in, Ange was sitting up in bed and playing with her Xbox. I sat down carefully beside her and took her hand. She turned to face me and smiled. We were both worn out, trembly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thanks," I said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She didn't say anything. She turned her face to me. She was grinning hugely, but fat tears were rolling down her cheeks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I hugged her and she grabbed tightly onto me. "You're a good man, Marcus Yallow," she whispered. "Thank you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I didn't know what to say, but I squeezed her back. Finally, we parted. She wasn't crying any more, but she was still smiling.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She pointed at my Xbox, on the floor beside the bed. I took the hint. I picked it up and plugged it in and logged in.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Same old same old. Lots of email. The new posts on the blogs I read streamed in. Spam. God did I get a lot of spam. My Swedish mailbox was repeatedly "joe-jobbed" -- used as the return address for spams sent to hundreds of millions of Internet accounts, so that all the bounces and angry messages came back to me. I didn't know who was behind it. Maybe the DHS trying to overwhelm my mailbox. Maybe it was just people pranking. The Pirate Party had pretty good filters, though, and they gave anyone who wanted it 500 gigabytes of email storage, so I wasn't likely to be drowned any time soon.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I filtered it all out, hammering on the delete key. I had a separate mailbox for stuff that came in encrypted to my public key, since that was likely to be Xnet-related and possibly sensitive. Spammers hadn't figured out that using public keys would make their junk mail more plausible yet, so for now this worked well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There were a couple dozen encrypted messages from people in the web of trust. I skimmed them -- links to videos and pics of new abuses from the DHS, horror stories about near-escapes, rants about stuff I'd blogged. The usual.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then I came to one that was only encrypted to my public key. That meant that no one else could read it, but I had no idea who had written it. It said it came from Masha, which could either be a handle or a name -- I couldn't tell which.</p>
<p class="western36">&gt; M1k3y</p>
<p class="western37"/>
<p class="western36">&gt; You don't know me, but I know you.</p>
<p class="western37"/>
<p class="western36">&gt; I was arrested the day that the bridge blew. They questioned me. They decided I was innocent. They offered me a job: help them hunt down the terrorists who'd killed my neighbors.</p>
<p class="western37"/>
<p class="western36">&gt; It sounded like a good deal at the time. Little did I realize that my actual job would turn out to be spying on kids who resented their city being turned into a police state.</p>
<p class="western37"/>
<p class="western36">&gt; I infiltrated Xnet on the day it launched. I am in your web of trust. If I wanted to spill my identity, I could send you email from an address you'd trust. Three addresses, actually. I'm totally inside your network as only another 17-year-old can be. Some of the email you've gotten has been carefully chosen misinformation from me and my handlers.</p>
<p class="western37"/>
<p class="western36">&gt; They don't know who you are, but they're coming close. They continue to turn people, to compromise them. They mine the social network sites and use threats to turn kids into informants. There are hundreds of people working for the DHS on Xnet right now. I have their names, handles and keys. Private and public.</p>
<p class="western37"/>
<p class="western36">&gt; Within days of the Xnet launch, we went to work on exploiting ParanoidLinux. The exploits so far have been small and insubstantial, but a break is inevitable. Once we have a zero-day break, you're dead.</p>
<p class="western37"/>
<p class="western36">&gt; I think it's safe to say that if my handlers knew that I was typing this, my ass would be stuck in Gitmo-by-the-Bay until I was an old woman.</p>
<p class="western37"/>
<p class="western36">&gt; Even if they don't break ParanoidLinux, there are poisoned ParanoidXbox distros floating around. They don't match the checksums, but how many people look at the checksums? Besides me and you? Plenty of kids are already dead, though they don't know it.</p>
<p class="western37"/>
<p class="western36">&gt; All that remains is for my handlers to figure out the best time to bust you to make the biggest impact in the media. That time will be sooner, not later. Believe.</p>
<p class="western37"/>
<p class="western36">&gt; You're probably wondering why I'm telling you this.</p>
<p class="western37"/>
<p class="western36">&gt; I am too.</p>
<p class="western37"/>
<p class="western36">&gt; Here's where I come from. I signed up to fight terrorists. Instead, I'm spying on Americans who believe things that the DHS doesn't like. Not people who plan on blowing up bridges, but protestors. I can't do it anymore.</p>
<p class="western37"/>
<p class="western36">&gt; But neither can you, whether or not you know it. Like I say, it's only a matter of time until you're in chains on Treasure Island. That's not if, that's when.</p>
<p class="western37"/>
<p class="western36">&gt; So I'm through here. Down in Los Angeles, there are some people. They say they can keep me safe if I want to get out.</p>
<p class="western37"/>
<p class="western36">&gt; I want to get out.</p>
<p class="western37"/>
<p class="western36">&gt; I will take you with me, if you want to come. Better to be a fighter than a martyr. If you come with me, we can figure out how to win together. I'm as smart as you. Believe.</p>
<p class="western37"/>
<p class="western36">&gt; What do you say?</p>
<p class="western37"/>
<p class="western36">&gt; Here's my public key.</p>
<p class="western37"/>
<p class="western36">&gt; Masha</p>
<p class="western37"/>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">When in trouble or in doubt, run in circles, scream and shout.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ever hear that rhyme? It's not good advice, but at least it's easy to follow. I leapt off the bed and paced back and forth. My heart thudded and my blood sang in a cruel parody of the way I'd felt when we got home. This wasn't sexual excitement, it was raw terror.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What?" Ange said. "What?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I pointed at the screen on my side of the bed. She rolled over and grabbed my keyboard and scribed on the touchpad with her fingertip. She read in silence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I paced.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"This has to be lies," she said. "The DHS is playing games with your head."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I looked at her. She was biting her lip. She didn't look like she believed it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You think?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sure. They can't beat you, so they're coming after you using Xnet."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I sat back down on the bed. I was breathing fast again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Chill out," she said. "It's just head-games. Here."</p>
<p class="calibre1">She never took my keyboard from me before, but now there was a new intimacy between us. She hit reply and typed,</p>
<p class="western32">&gt; Nice try.</p>
<p class="western33"/>
<p class="calibre1">She was writing as M1k3y now, too. We were together in a way that was different from before.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Go ahead and sign it. We'll see what she says."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I didn't know if that was the best idea, but I didn't have any better ones. I signed it and encrypted it with my private key and the public key Masha had provided.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The reply was instant.</p>
<p class="western32">&gt; I thought you'd say something like that.</p>
<p class="western33"/>
<p class="western32">&gt; Here's a hack you haven't thought of. I can anonymously tunnel video over DNS. Here are some links to clips you might want to look at before you decide I'm full of it. These people are all recording each other, all the time, as insurance against a back-stab. It's pretty easy to snoop off them as they snoop on each other.</p>
<p class="western33"/>
<p class="western32">&gt; Masha</p>
<p class="western33"/>
<p class="calibre1">Attached was source-code for a little program that appeared to do exactly what Masha claimed: pull video over the Domain Name Service protocol.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Let me back up a moment here and explain something. At the end of the day, every Internet protocol is just a sequence of text sent back and forth in a prescribed order. It's kind of like getting a truck and putting a car in it, then putting a motorcycle in the car's trunk, then attaching a bicycle to the back of the motorcycle, then hanging a pair of Rollerblades on the back of the bike. Except that then, if you want, you can attach the truck to the Rollerblades.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, take Simple Mail Transport Protocol, or SMTP, which is used for sending email.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Here's a sample conversation between me and my mail server, sending a message to myself:</p>
<p class="western32">&gt; HELO littlebrother.com.se</p>
<p class="western33"/>
<p class="western32">250 mail.pirateparty.org.se Hello mail.pirateparty.org.se, pleased to meet you</p>

<p class="calibre1">This conversation's grammar was defined in 1982 by Jon Postel, one of the Internet's heroic forefathers, who used to literally run the most important servers on the net under his desk at the University of Southern California, back in the paleolithic era.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, imagine that you hooked up a mail-server to an IM session. You could send an IM to the server that said "HELO littlebrother.com.se" and it would reply with "250 mail.pirateparty.org.se Hello mail.pirateparty.org.se, pleased to meet you." In other words, you could have the same conversation over IM as you do over SMTP. With the right tweaks, the whole mail-server business could take place inside of a chat. Or a web-session. Or anything else.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is called "tunneling." You put the SMTP inside a chat "tunnel." You could then put the chat back into an SMTP tunnel if you wanted to be really weird, tunneling the tunnel in another tunnel.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, every Internet protocol is susceptible to this process. It's cool, because it means that if you're on a network with only Web access, you can tunnel your mail over it. You can tunnel your favorite P2P over it. You can even tunnel Xnet -- which itself is a tunnel for dozens of protocols -- over it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Domain Name Service is an interesting and ancient Internet protocol, dating back to 1983. It's the way that your computer converts a computer's name -- like pirateparty.org.se -- to the IP number that computers actually use to talk to each other over the net, like 204.11.50.136. It generally works like magic, even though it's got millions of moving parts -- every ISP runs a DNS server, as do most governments and lots of private operators. These DNS boxes all talk to each other all the time, making and filling requests to each other so no matter how obscure the name is you feed to your computer, it will be able to turn it into a number.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Before DNS, there was the HOSTS file. Believe it or not, this was a single document that listed the name and address of <i class="calibre6">every single computer</i> connected to the Internet. Every computer had a copy of it. This file was eventually too big to move around, so DNS was invented, and ran on a server that used to live under Jon Postel's desk. If the cleaners knocked out the plug, the entire Internet lost its ability to find itself. Seriously.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The thing about DNS today is that it's everywhere. Every network has a DNS server living on it, and all of those servers are configured to talk to each other and to random people all over the Internet.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What Masha had done was figure out a way to tunnel a video-streaming system over DNS. She was breaking up the video into billions of pieces and hiding each of them in a normal message to a DNS server. By running her code, I was able to pull the video from all those DNS servers, all over the Internet, at incredible speed. It must have looked bizarre on the network histograms, like I was looking up the address of every computer in the world.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But it had two advantages I appreciated at once: I was able to get the video with blinding speed -- as soon as I clicked the first link, I started to receive full-screen pictures, without any jitter or stuttering -- and I had no idea where it was hosted. It was totally anonymous.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At first I didn't even clock the content of the video. I was totally floored by the cleverness of this hack. Streaming video from DNS? That was so smart and weird, it was practically <i class="calibre6"><span class="c9">perverted</span></i>.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gradually, what I was seeing began to sink in.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a board-room table in a small room with a mirror down one wall. I knew that room. I'd sat in that room, while Severe-Haircut woman had made me speak my password aloud. There were five comfortable chairs around the table, each with a comfortable person, all in DHS uniform. I recognized Major General Graeme Sutherland, the DHS Bay Area commander, along with Severe Haircut. The others were new to me. They all watched a video screen at the end of the table, on which there was an infinitely more familiar face.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kurt Rooney was known nationally as the President's chief strategist, the man who returned the party for its third term, and who was steaming towards a fourth. They called him "Ruthless" and I'd seen a news report once about how tight a rein he kept his staffers on, calling them, IMing them, watching their every motion, controlling every step. He was old, with a lined face and pale gray eyes and a flat nose with broad, flared nostrils and thin lips, a man who looked like he was smelling something bad all the time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He was the man on the screen. He was talking, and everyone else was focused on his screen, everyone taking notes as fast as they could type, trying to look smart.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"-- say that they're angry with authority, but we need to show the country that it's terrorists, not the government, that they need to blame. Do you understand me? The nation does not love that city. As far as they're concerned, it is a Sodom and Gomorrah of fags and atheists who deserve to rot in hell. The only reason the country cares what they think in San Francisco is that they had the good fortune to have been blown to hell by some Islamic terrorists.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"These Xnet children are getting to the point where they might start to be useful to us. The more radical they get, the more the rest of the nation understands that there are threats everywhere."</p>
<p class="calibre1">His audience finished typing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"We can control that, I think," Severe Haircut Lady said. "Our people in the Xnet have built up a lot of influence. The Manchurian Bloggers are running as many as fifty blogs each, flooding the chat channels, linking to each other, mostly just taking the party line set by this M1k3y. But they've already shown that they can provoke radical action, even when M1k3y is putting the brakes on."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Major General Sutherland nodded. "We have been planning to leave them underground until about a month before the midterms." I guessed that meant the mid-term elections, not my exams. "That's per the original plan. But it sounds like --"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"We've got another plan for the midterms," Rooney said. "Need-to-know, of course, but you should all probably not plan on traveling for the month before. Cut the Xnet loose now, as soon as you can. So long as they're moderates, they're a liability. Keep them radical."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The video cut off.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ange and I sat on the edge of the bed, looking at the screen. Ange reached out and started the video again. We watched it. It was worse the second time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I tossed the keyboard aside and got up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I am <i class="calibre6">so sick</i> of being scared," I said. "Let's take this to Barbara and have her publish it all. Put it all on the net. Let them take me away. At least I'll know what's going to happen then. At least then I'll have a little <i class="calibre6">certainty</i> in my life."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ange grabbed me and hugged me, soothed me. "I know baby, I know. It's all terrible. But you're focusing on the bad stuff and ignoring the good stuff. You've created a movement. You've outflanked the jerks in the White House, the crooks in DHS uniforms. You've put yourself in a position where you could be responsible for blowing the lid off of the entire rotten DHS thing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sure they're out to get you. Course they are. Have you ever doubted it for a moment? I always figured they were. But Marcus, <i class="calibre6">they don't know who you are</i>. Think about that. All those people, money, guns and spies, and you, a seventeen year old high school kid -- you're still beating them. They don't know about Barbara. They don't know about Zeb. You've jammed them in the streets of San Francisco and humiliated them before the world. So stop moping, all right? You're winning."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"They're coming for me, though. You see that. They're going to put me in jail forever. Not even jail. I'll just disappear, like Darryl. Maybe worse. Maybe Syria. Why leave me in San Francisco? I'm a liability as long as I'm in the USA."</p>
<p class="calibre1">She sat down on the bed with me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah," she said. "That."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, you know what you have to do, right?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What?" She looked pointedly at my keyboard. I could see the tears rolling down her cheeks. "No! You're out of your mind. You think I'm going to run off with some nut off the Internet? Some spy?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You got a better idea?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I kicked a pile of her laundry into the air. "Whatever. Fine. I'll talk to her some more."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You talk to her," Ange said. "You tell her you and your girlfriend are getting out."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shut up, dickhead. You think you're in danger? I'm in just as much danger, Marcus. It's called guilt by association. When you go, I go." She had her jaw thrust out at a mutinous angle. "You and I -- we're together now. You have to understand that."</p>
<p class="calibre1">We sat down on the bed together.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Unless you don't want me," she said, finally, in a small voice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're kidding me, right?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do I look like I'm kidding?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"There's no way I would voluntarily go without you, Ange. I could never have asked you to come, but I'm ecstatic that you offered."</p>
<p class="calibre1">She smiled and tossed me my keyboard.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Email this Masha creature. Let's see what this chick can do for us."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I emailed her, encrypting the message, waiting for a reply. Ange nuzzled me a little and I kissed her and we necked. Something about the danger and the pact to go together -- it made me forget the awkwardness of having sex, made me freaking horny as hell.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We were half naked again when Masha's email arrived.</p>
<p class="western9">&gt; Two of you? Jesus, like it won't be hard enough already.</p>
<p class="western10"/>
<p class="western9">&gt; I don't get to leave except to do field intelligence after a big Xnet hit. You get me? The handlers watch my every move, but I go off the leash when something big happens with Xnetters. I get sent into the field then.</p>
<p class="western10"/>
<p class="western9">&gt; You do something big. I get sent to it. I get us both out. All three of us, if you insist.</p>
<p class="western10"/>
<p class="western9">&gt; Make it fast, though. I can't send you a lot of email, understand? They watch me. They're closing in on you. You don't have a lot of time. Weeks? Maybe just days.</p>
<p class="western10"/>
<p class="western9">&gt; I need you to get me out. That's why I'm doing this, in case you're wondering. I can't escape on my own. I need a big Xnet distraction. That's your department. Don't fail me, M1k3y, or we're both dead. Your girlie too.</p>
<p class="western10"/>
<p class="western9">&gt; Masha</p>
<p class="western10"/>
<p class="calibre1">My phone rang, making us both jump. It was my mom wanting to know when I was coming home. I told her I was on my way. She didn't mention Barbara. We'd agreed that we wouldn't talk about any of this stuff on the phone. That was my dad's idea. He could be as paranoid as me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I have to go," I said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Our parents will be --"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I know," I said. "I saw what happened to my parents when they thought I was dead. Knowing that I'm a fugitive isn't going to be much better. But they'd rather I be a fugitive than a prisoner. That's what I think. Anyway, once we disappear, Barbara can publish without worrying about getting us into trouble."</p>
<p class="calibre1">We kissed at the door of her room. Not one of the hot, sloppy numbers we usually did when parting ways. A sweet kiss this time. A slow kiss. A goodbye kind of kiss.</p>

<p class="calibre1">BART rides are introspective. When the train rocks back and forth and you try not to make eye contact with the other riders and you try not to read the ads for plastic surgery, bail bondsmen and AIDS testing, when you try to ignore the graffiti and not look too closely at the stuff in the carpeting. That's when your mind starts to really churn and churn.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You rock back and forth and your mind goes over all the things you've overlooked, plays back all the movies of your life where you're no hero, where you're a chump or a sucker.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Your brain comes up with theories like this one:</p>
<p class="c5">If the DHS wanted to catch M1k3y, what better way than to lure him into the open, panic him into leading some kind of big, public Xnet event? Wouldn't that be worth the chance of a compromising video leaking?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Your brain comes up with stuff like that even when the train ride only lasts two or three stops. When you get off, and you start moving, the blood gets running and sometimes your brain helps you out again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes your brain gives you solutions in addition to problems.</p>
<p class="c3">Chapter 18</p>
<p class="c5">This chapter is dedicated to Vancouver's multilingual Sophia Books, a diverse and exciting store filled with the best of the strange and exciting pop culture worlds of many lands. Sophia was around the corner from my hotel when I went to Van to give a talk at Simon Fraser University, and the Sophia folks emailed me in advance to ask me to drop in and sign their stock while I was in the neighborhood. When I got there, I discovered a treasure-trove of never-before-seen works in a dizzying array of languages, from graphic novels to thick academic treatises, presided over by good-natured (even slapstick) staff who so palpably enjoyed their jobs that it spread to every customer who stepped through the door.</p>
<p class="c5"><a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Sophia Books</a>: 450 West Hastings St., Vancouver, BC Canada V6B1L1 +1 604 684 0484</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a time when my favorite thing in the world was putting on a cape and hanging out in hotels, pretending to be an invisible vampire whom everyone stared at.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It's complicated, and not nearly as weird as it sounds. The Live Action Role Playing scene combines the best aspects of D&amp;D with drama club with going to sci-fi cons.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I understand that this might not make it sound as appealing to you as it was to me when I was 14.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The best games were the ones at the Scout Camps out of town: a hundred teenagers, boys and girls, fighting the Friday night traffic, swapping stories, playing handheld games, showing off for hours. Then debarking to stand in the grass before a group of older men and women in bad-ass, home-made armor, dented and scarred, like armor must have been in the old days, not like it's portrayed in the movies, but like a soldier's uniform after a month in the bush.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These people were nominally paid to run the games, but you didn't get the job unless you were the kind of person who'd do it for free. They'd have already divided us into teams based on the questionnaires we'd filled in beforehand, and we'd get our team assignments then, like being called up for baseball sides.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then you'd get your briefing packages. These were like the briefings the spies get in the movies: here's your identity, here's your mission, here's the secrets you know about the group.</p>
<p class="calibre1">From there, it was time for dinner: roaring fires, meat popping on spits, tofu sizzling on skillets (it's northern California, a vegetarian option is not optional), and a style of eating and drinking that can only be described as quaffing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Already, the keen kids would be getting into character. My first game, I was a wizard. I had a bag of beanbags that represented spells -- when I threw one, I would shout the name of the spell I was casting -- fireball, magic missile, cone of light -- and the player or "monster" I threw it at would keel over if I connected. Or not -- sometimes we had to call in a ref to mediate, but for the most part, we were all pretty good about playing fair. No one liked a dice lawyer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">By bedtime, we were all in character. At 14, I wasn't super-sure what a wizard was supposed to sound like, but I could take my cues from the movies and novels. I spoke in slow, measured tones, keeping my face composed in a suitably mystical expression, and thinking mystical thoughts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The mission was complicated, retrieving a sacred relic that had been stolen by an ogre who was bent on subjugating the people of the land to his will. It didn't really matter a whole lot. What mattered was that I had a private mission, to capture a certain kind of imp to serve as my familiar, and that I had a secret nemesis, another player on the team who had taken part in a raid that killed my family when I was a boy, a player who didn't know that I'd come back, bent on revenge. Somewhere, of course, there was another player with a similar grudge against me, so that even as I was enjoying the camaraderie of the team, I'd always have to keep an eye open for a knife in the back, poison in the food.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For the next two days, we played it out. There were parts of the weekend that were like hide-and-seek, some that were like wilderness survival exercises, some that were like solving crossword puzzles. The game-masters had done a great job. And you really got to be friends with the other people on the mission. Darryl was the target of my first murder, and I put my back into it, even though he was my pal. Nice guy. Shame I'd have to kill him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I fireballed him as he was seeking out treasure after we wiped out a band of orcs, playing rock-papers-scissors with each orc to determine who would prevail in combat. This is a lot more exciting than it sounds.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was like summer camp for drama geeks. We talked until late at night in tents, looked at the stars, jumped in the river when we got hot, slapped away mosquitos. Became best friends, or lifelong enemies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I don't know why Charles's parents sent him LARPing. He wasn't the kind of kid who really enjoyed that kind of thing. He was more the pulling-wings-off-flies type. Oh, maybe not. But he just was not into being in costume in the woods. He spent the whole time mooching around, sneering at everyone and everything, trying to convince us all that we weren't having the good time we all felt like we were having. You've no doubt found that kind of person before, the kind of person who is compelled to ensure that everyone else has a rotten time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The other thing about Charles was that he couldn't get the hang of simulated combat. Once you start running around the woods and playing these elaborate, semi-military games, it's easy to get totally adrenalized to the point where you're ready to tear out someone's throat. This is not a good state to be in when you're carrying a prop sword, club, pike or other utensil. This is why no one is ever allowed to hit anyone, under any circumstances, in these games. Instead, when you get close enough to someone to fight, you play a quick couple rounds of rock-paper-scissors, with modifiers based on your experience, armaments, and condition. The referees mediate disputes. It's quite civilized, and a little weird. You go running after someone through the woods, catch up with him, bare your teeth, and sit down to play a little roshambo. But it works -- and it keeps everything safe and fun.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Charles couldn't really get the hang of this. I think he was perfectly capable of understanding that the rule was no contact, but he was simultaneously capable of deciding that the rule didn't matter, and that he wasn't going to abide by it. The refs called him on it a bunch of times over the weekend, and he kept on promising to stick by it, and kept on going back. He was one of the bigger kids there already, and he was fond of "accidentally" tackling you at the end of a chase. Not fun when you get tackled into the rocky forest floor.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I had just mightily smote Darryl in a little clearing where he'd been treasure-hunting, and we were having a little laugh over my extreme sneakiness. He was going to go monstering -- killed players could switch to playing monsters, which meant that the longer the game wore on, the more monsters there were coming after you, meaning that everyone got to keep on playing and the game's battles just got more and more epic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That was when Charles came out of the woods behind me and tackled me, throwing me to the ground so hard that I couldn't breathe for a moment. "Gotcha!" he yelled. I only knew him slightly before this, and I'd never thought much of him, but now I was ready for murder. I climbed slowly to my feet and looked at him, his chest heaving, grinning. "You're so dead," he said. "I totally got you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I smiled and something felt wrong and sore in my face. I touched my upper lip. It was bloody. My nose was bleeding and my lip was split, cut on a root I'd face-planted into when he tackled me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I wiped the blood on my pants-leg and smiled. I made like I thought that it was all in fun. I laughed a little. I moved towards him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Charles wasn't fooled. He was already backing away, trying to fade into the woods. Darryl moved to flank him. I took the other flank. Abruptly, he turned and ran. Darryl's foot hooked his ankle and sent him sprawling. We rushed him, just in time to hear a ref's whistle.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The ref hadn't seen Charles foul me, but he'd seen Charles's play that weekend. He sent Charles back to the camp entrance and told him he was out of the game. Charles complained mightily, but to our satisfaction, the ref wasn't having any of it. Once Charles had gone, he gave <i class="calibre6">us</i> both a lecture, too, telling us that our retaliation was no more justified than Charles's attack.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was OK. That night, once the games had ended, we all got hot showers in the scout dorms. Darryl and I stole Charles's clothes and towel. We tied them in knots and dropped them in the urinal. A lot of the boys were happy to contribute to the effort of soaking them. Charles had been very enthusiastic about his tackles.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I wish I could have watched him when he got out of his shower and discovered his clothes. It's a hard decision: do you run naked across the camp, or pick apart the tight, piss-soaked knots in your clothes and then put them on?</p>
<p class="calibre1">He chose nudity. I probably would have chosen the same. We lined up along the route from the showers to the shed where the packs were stored and applauded him. I was at the front of the line, leading the applause.</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">The Scout Camp weekends only came three or four times a year, which left Darryl and me -- and lots of other LARPers -- with a serious LARP deficiency in our lives.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Luckily, there were the Wretched Daylight games in the city hotels. Wretched Daylight is another LARP, rival vampire clans and vampire hunters, and it's got its own quirky rules. Players get cards to help them resolve combat skirmishes, so each skirmish involves playing a little hand of a strategic card game. Vampires can become invisible by cloaking themselves, crossing their arms over their chests, and all the other players have to pretend they don't see them, continuing on with their conversations about their plans and so on. The true test of a good player is whether you're honest enough to go on spilling your secrets in front of an "invisible" rival without acting as though he was in the room.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There were a couple of big Wretched Daylight games every month. The organizers of the games had a good relationship with the city's hotels and they let it be known that they'd take ten unbooked rooms on Friday night and fill them with players who'd run around the hotel, playing low-key Wretched Daylight in the corridors, around the pool, and so on, eating at the hotel restaurant and paying for the hotel WiFi. They'd close the booking on Friday afternoon, email us, and we'd go straight from school to whichever hotel it was, bringing our knapsacks, sleeping six or eight to a room for the weekend, living on junk-food, playing until three AM. It was good, safe fun that our parents could get behind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The organizers were a well-known literacy charity that ran kids' writing workshops, drama workshops and so on. They had been running the games for ten years without incident. Everything was strictly booze- and drug-free, to keep the organizers from getting busted on some kind of corruption of minors rap. We'd draw between ten and a hundred players, depending on the weekend, and for the cost of a couple movies, you could have two and a half days' worth of solid fun.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One day, though, they lucked into a block of rooms at the Monaco, a hotel in the Tenderloin that catered to arty older tourists, the kind of place where every room came with a goldfish bowl, where the lobby was full of beautiful old people in fine clothes, showing off their plastic surgery results.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Normally, the mundanes -- our word for non-players -- just ignored us, figuring that we were skylarking kids. But that weekend there happened to be an editor for an Italian travel magazine staying, and he took an interest in things. He cornered me as I skulked in the lobby, hoping to spot the clan-master of my rivals and swoop in on him and draw his blood. I was standing against the wall with my arms folded over my chest, being invisible, when he came up to me and asked me, in accented English, what me and my friends were doing in the hotel that weekend?</p>
<p class="calibre1">I tried to brush him off, but he wouldn't be put off. So I figured I'd just make something up and he'd go away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I didn't imagine that he'd print it. I really didn't imagine that it would get picked up by the American press.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"We're here because our prince has died, and so we've had to come in search of a new ruler."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"A prince?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes," I said, getting into it. "We're the Old People. We came to America in the 16th Century and have had our own royal family in the wilds of Pennsylvania ever since. We live simply in the woods. We don't use modern technology. But the prince was the last of the line and he died last week. Some terrible wasting disease took him. The young men of my clan have left to find the descendants of his great-uncle, who went away to join the modern people in the time of my grandfather. He is said to have multiplied, and we will find the last of his bloodline and bring them back to their rightful home."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I read a lot of fantasy novels. This kind of thing came easily to me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"We found a woman who knew of these descendants. She told us one was staying in this hotel, and we've come to find him. But we've been tracked here by a rival clan who would keep us from bringing home our prince, to keep us weak and easy to dominate. Thus it is vital we keep to ourselves. We do not talk to the New People when we can help it. Talking to you now causes me great discomfort."</p>
<p class="calibre1">He was watching me shrewdly. I had uncrossed my arms, which meant that I was now "visible" to rival vampires, one of whom had been slowly sneaking up on us. At the last moment, I turned and saw her, arms spread, hissing at us, vamping it up in high style.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I threw my arms wide and hissed back at her, then pelted through the lobby, hopping over a leather sofa and deking around a potted plant, making her chase me. I'd scouted an escape route down through the stairwell to the basement health-club and I took it, shaking her off.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I didn't see him again that weekend, but I <i class="calibre6">did</i> relate the story to some of my fellow LARPers, who embroidered the tale and found lots of opportunities to tell it over the weekend.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Italian magazine had a staffer who'd done her master's degree on Amish anti-technology communities in rural Pennsylvania, and she thought we sounded awfully interesting. Based on the notes and taped interviews of her boss from his trip to San Francisco, she wrote a fascinating, heart-wrenching article about these weird, juvenile cultists who were crisscrossing America in search of their "prince." Hell, people will print anything these days.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But the thing was, stories like that get picked up and republished. First it was Italian bloggers, then a few American bloggers. People across the country reported "sightings" of the Old People, though whether they were making it up, or whether others were playing the same game, I didn't know.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It worked its way up the media food-chain all the way to the <i class="calibre6">New York Times</i>, who, unfortunately, have an unhealthy appetite for fact-checking. The reporter they put on the story eventually tracked it down to the Monaco Hotel, who put them in touch with the LARP organizers, who laughingly spilled the whole story.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, at that point, LARPing got a lot less cool. We became known as the nation's foremost hoaxers, as weird, pathological liars. The press who we'd inadvertently tricked into covering the story of the Old People were now interested in redeeming themselves by reporting on how unbelievably weird we LARPers were, and that was when Charles let everyone in school know that Darryl and I were the biggest LARPing weenies in the city.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That was not a good season. Some of the gang didn't mind, but we did. The teasing was merciless. Charles led it. I'd find plastic fangs in my bag, and kids I passed in the hall would go "bleh, bleh" like a cartoon vampire, or they'd talk with fake Transylvanian accents when I was around.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We switched to ARGing pretty soon afterwards. It was more fun in some ways, and it was a lot less weird. Every now and again, though, I missed my cape and those weekends in the hotel.</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">The opposite of esprit d'escalier is the way that life's embarrassments come back to haunt us even after they're long past. I could remember every stupid thing I'd ever said or done, recall them with picture-perfect clarity. Any time I was feeling low, I'd naturally start to remember other times I felt that way, a hit-parade of humiliations coming one after another to my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As I tried to concentrate on Masha and my impending doom, the Old People incident kept coming back to haunt me. There'd been a similar, sick, sinking doomed feeling then, as more and more press outlets picked up the story, as the likelihood increased of someone figuring out that it had been me who'd sprung the story on the stupid Italian editor in the designer jeans with crooked seams, the starched collarless shirt, and the oversized metal-rimmed glasses.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There's an alternative to dwelling on your mistakes. You can learn from them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It's a good theory, anyway. Maybe the reason your subconscious dredges up all these miserable ghosts is that they need to get closure before they can rest peacefully in humiliation afterlife. My subconscious kept visiting me with ghosts in the hopes that I would do something to let them rest in peace.</p>
<p class="calibre1">All the way home, I turned over this memory and the thought of what I would do about "Masha," in case she was playing me. I needed some insurance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And by the time I reached my house -- to be swept up into melancholy hugs from Mom and Dad -- I had it.</p>

<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">The trick was to time this so that it happened fast enough that the DHS couldn't prepare for it, but with a long enough lead time that the Xnet would have time to turn out in force.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The trick was to stage this so that there were too many present to arrest us all, but to put it somewhere that the press could see it and the grownups, so the DHS wouldn't just gas us again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The trick was to come up with something with the media friendliness of the levitation of the Pentagon. The trick was to stage something that we could rally around, like 3,000 Berkeley students refusing to let one of their number be taken away in a police van.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The trick was to put the press there, ready to say what the police did, the way they had in 1968 in Chicago.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was going to be some trick.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I cut out of school an hour early the next day, using my customary techniques for getting out, not caring if it would trigger some kind of new DHS checker that would result in my parents getting a note.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One way or another, my parents' last problem after tomorrow would be whether I was in trouble at school.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I met Ange at her place. She'd had to cut out of school even earlier, but she'd just made a big deal out of her cramps and pretended she was going to keel over and they sent her home.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We started to spread the word on Xnet. We sent it in email to trusted friends, and IMmed it to our buddy lists. We roamed the decks and towns of Clockwork Plunder and told our team-mates. Giving everyone enough information to get them to show up but not so much as to tip our hand to the DHS was tricky, but I thought I had just the right balance:</p>

<p class="western38">&gt; The game starts at 8:00AM sharp. SHARP. Be there and ready to be divided into teams. The game lasts 30 minutes, so you'll have plenty of time to get to school afterward.</p>
<p class="western39"/>
<p class="western38">&gt; Location will be revealed tomorrow. Email your public key to m1k3y@littlebrother.pirateparty.org.se and check your messages at 7AM for the update. If that's too early for you, stay up all night. That's what we're going to do.</p>
<p class="western39"/>
<p class="western38">&gt; This is the most fun you will have all year, guaranteed.</p>
<p class="western39"/>
<p class="western38">&gt; Believe.</p>
<p class="western39"/>
<p class="western38">&gt; M1k3y</p>
<p class="western39"/>
<p class="calibre1">Then I sent a short message to Masha.</p>
<p class="western38">&gt; Tomorrow</p>
<p class="western39"/>
<p class="western38">&gt; M1k3y</p>
<p class="western39"/>
<p class="calibre1">A minute later, she emailed back:</p>
<p class="western38">&gt; I thought so. VampMob, huh? You work fast. Wear a red hat. Travel light.</p>

<p class="calibre1">What do you bring along when you go fugitive? I'd carried enough heavy packs around enough scout camps to know that every ounce you add cuts into your shoulders with all the crushing force of gravity with every step you take -- it's not just one ounce, it's one ounce that you carry for a million steps. It's a ton.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Right," Ange said. "Smart. And you never take more than three days' worth of clothes, either. You can rinse stuff out in the sink. Better to have a spot on your t-shirt than a suitcase that's too big and heavy to stash under a plane-seat."</p>
<p class="calibre1">She'd pulled out a ballistic nylon courier bag that went across her chest, between her breasts -- something that made me get a little sweaty -- and slung diagonally across her back. It was roomy inside, and she'd set it down on the bed. Now she was piling clothes next to it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I figure that three t-shirts, a pair of pants, a pair of shorts, three changes of underwear, three pairs of socks and a sweater will do it."</p>
<p class="calibre1">She dumped out her gym bag and picked out her toiletries. "I'll have to remember to stick my toothbrush in tomorrow morning before I head down to Civic Center."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Watching her pack was impressive. She was ruthless about it all. It was also freaky -- it made me realize that the next day, I was going to go away. Maybe for a long time. Maybe forever.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do I bring my Xbox?" she asked. "I've got a ton of stuff on the hard-drive, notes and sketches and email. I wouldn't want it to fall into the wrong hands."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's all encrypted," I said. "That's standard with ParanoidXbox. But leave the Xbox behind, there'll be plenty of them in LA. Just create a Pirate Party account and email an image of your hard-drive to yourself. I'm going to do the same when I get home."</p>
<p class="calibre1">She did so, and queued up the email. It was going to take a couple hours for all the data to squeeze through her neighbor's WiFi network and wing its way to Sweden.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then she closed the flap on the bag and tightened the compression straps. She had something the size of a soccer-ball slung over her back now, and I stared admiringly at it. She could walk down the street with that under her shoulder and no one would look twice -- she looked like she was on her way to school.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"One more thing," she said, and went to her bedside table and took out the condoms. She took the strips of rubbers out of the box and opened the bag and stuck them inside, then gave me a slap on the ass.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now what?" I said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now we go to your place and do your stuff. It's time I met your parents, no?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">She left the bag amid the piles of clothes and junk all over the floor. She was ready to turn her back on all of it, walk away, just to be with me. Just to support the cause. It made me feel brave, too.</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">Mom was already home when I got there. She had her laptop open on the kitchen table and was answering email while talking into a headset connected to it, helping some poor Yorkshireman and his family acclimate to living in Louisiana.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I came through the door and Ange followed, grinning like mad, but holding my hand so tight I could feel the bones grinding together. I didn't know what she was so worried about. It wasn't like she was going to end up spending a lot of time hanging around with my parents after this, even if it went badly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom hung up on the Yorkshireman when we got in.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hello, Marcus," she said, giving me a kiss on the cheek. "And who is this?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mom, meet Ange. Ange, this is my Mom, Lillian." Mom stood up and gave Ange a hug.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's very good to meet you, darling," she said, looking her over from top to bottom. Ange looked pretty acceptable, I think. She dressed well, and low-key, and you could tell how smart she was just by looking at her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"A pleasure to meet you, Mrs Yallow," she said. She sounded very confident and self-assured. Much better than I had when I'd met her mom.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's Lillian, love," she said. She was taking in every detail. "Are you staying for dinner?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'd love that," she said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do you eat meat?" Mom's pretty acclimated to living in California.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I eat anything that doesn't eat me first," she said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"She's a hot-sauce junkie," I said. "You could serve her old tires and she'd eat 'em if she could smother them in salsa."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ange socked me gently in the shoulder.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I was going to order Thai," Mom said. "I'll add a couple of their five-chili dishes to the order."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ange thanked her politely and Mom bustled around the kitchen, getting us glasses of juice and a plate of biscuits and asking three times if we wanted any tea. I squirmed a little.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thanks, Mom," I said. "We're going to go upstairs for a while."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom's eyes narrowed for a second, then she smiled again. "Of course," she said. "Your father will be home in an hour, we'll eat then."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I had my vampire stuff all stashed in the back of my closet. I let Ange sort through it while I went through my clothes. I was only going as far as LA. They had stores there, all the clothing I could need. I just needed to get together three or four favorite tees and a favorite pair of jeans, a tube of deodorant, a roll of dental floss.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Money!" I said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah," she said. "I was going to clean out my bank account on the way home at an ATM. I've got maybe five hundred saved up."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Really?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What am I going to spend it on?" she said. "Ever since the Xnet, I haven't had to even pay any service charges."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I think I've got three hundred or so."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, there you go. Grab it on the way to Civic Center in the morning."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I had a big book-bag I used when I was hauling lots of gear around town. It was less conspicuous than my camping pack. Ange went through my piles mercilessly and culled them down to her favorites.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Once it was packed and under my bed, we both sat down.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"We're going to have to get up really early tomorrow," she said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah, big day."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The plan was to get messages out with a bunch of fake VampMob locations tomorrow, sending people out to secluded spots within a few minutes' walk of Civic Center. We'd cut out a spray-paint stencil that just said VAMPMOB CIVIC CENTER -&gt; -&gt; that we would spray-paint at those spots around 5AM. That would keep the DHS from locking down the Civic Center before we got there. I had the mailbot ready to send out the messages at 7AM -- I'd just leave my Xbox running when I went out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"How long. . ." She trailed off.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's what I've been wondering, too," I said. "It could be a long time, I suppose. But who knows? With Barbara's article coming out --" I'd queued an email to her for the next morning, too -- "and all, maybe we'll be heroes in two weeks."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Maybe," she said and sighed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I put my arm around her. Her shoulders were shaking.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm terrified," I said. "I think that it would be crazy not to be terrified."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah," she said. "Yeah."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom called us to dinner. Dad shook Ange's hand. He looked unshaved and worried, the way he had since we'd gone to see Barbara, but on meeting Ange, a little of the old Dad came back. She kissed him on the cheek and he insisted that she call him Drew.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dinner was actually really good. The ice broke when Ange took out her hot-sauce mister and treated her plate, and explained about Scoville units. Dad tried a forkful of her food and went reeling into the kitchen to drink a gallon of milk. Believe it or not, Mom still tried it after that and gave every impression of loving it. Mom, it turned out, was an undiscovered spicy food prodigy, a natural.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Before she left, Ange pressed the hot-sauce mister on Mom. "I have a spare at home," she said. I'd watched her pack it in her backpack. "You seem like the kind of woman who should have one of these."</p>
<p class="c3">Chapter 19</p>
<p class="c5">This chapter is dedicated to the MIT Press Bookshop, a store I've visited on every single trip to Boston over the past ten years. MIT, of course, is one of the legendary origin nodes for global nerd culture, and the campus bookstore lives up to the incredible expectations I had when I first set foot in it. In addition to the wonderful titles published by the MIT press, the bookshop is a tour through the most exciting high-tech publications in the world, from hacker zines like 2600 to fat academic anthologies on video-game design. This is one of those stores where I have to ask them to ship my purchases home because they don't fit in my suitcase.</p>
<p class="c5"><a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">MIT Press Bookstore</a>: Building E38, 77 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge, MA USA 02139-4307 +1 617 253 5249</p>
<p class="calibre1">Here's the email that went out at 7AM the next day, while Ange and I were spray-painting VAMP-MOB CIVIC CENTER -&gt; -&gt; at strategic locations around town.</p>
<p class="western9">&gt; RULES FOR VAMPMOB</p>
<p class="western10"/>
<p class="western9">&gt; You are part of a clan of daylight vampires. You've discovered the secret of surviving the terrible light of the sun. The secret was cannibalism: the blood of another vampire can give you the strength to walk among the living.</p>
<p class="western10"/>
<p class="western9">&gt; You need to bite as many other vampires as you can in order to stay in the game. If one minute goes by without a bite, you're out. Once you're out, turn your shirt around backwards and go referee -- watch two or three vamps to see if they're getting their bites in.</p>
<p class="western10"/>
<p class="western9">&gt; To bite another vamp, you have to say "Bite!" five times before they do. So you run up to a vamp, make eye-contact, and shout "bite bite bite bite bite!" and if you get it out before she does, you live and she crumbles to dust.</p>
<p class="western10"/>
<p class="western9">&gt; You and the other vamps you meet at your rendezvous are a team. They are your clan. You derive no nourishment from their blood.</p>
<p class="western10"/>
<p class="western9">&gt; You can "go invisible" by standing still and folding your arms over your chest. You can't bite invisible vamps, and they can't bite you.</p>
<p class="western10"/>
<p class="western9">&gt; This game is played on the honor system. The point is to have fun and get your vamp on, not to win.</p>
<p class="western10"/>
<p class="western9">&gt; There is an end-game that will be passed by word of mouth as winners begin to emerge. The game-masters will start a whisper campaign among the players when the time comes. Spread the whisper as quickly as you can and watch for the sign.</p>
<p class="western10"/>
<p class="western9">&gt; M1k3y</p>
<p class="western10"/>
<p class="western9">&gt; bite bite bite bite bite!</p>
<p class="western10"/>
<p class="calibre1">We'd hoped that a hundred people would be willing to play VampMob. We'd sent out about two hundred invites each. But when I sat bolt upright at 4AM and grabbed my Xbox, there were <i class="calibre6">400</i> replies there. Four <i class="calibre6">hundred</i>.</p>
