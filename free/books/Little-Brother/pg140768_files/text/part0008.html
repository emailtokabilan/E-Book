<p class="calibre1">At 4:15 AM, Potrero Hill was as quiet as the countryside. There were some distant traffic rumbles, and once, a car crawled past me. I stopped at an ATM and drew out $320 in twenties, rolled them up and put a rubber-band around them, and stuck the roll in a zip-up pocket low on the thigh of my vampire pants.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was wearing my cape again, and a ruffled shirt, and tuxedo pants that had been modded to have enough pockets to carry all my little bits and pieces. I had on pointed boots with silver-skull buckles, and I'd teased my hair into a black dandelion clock around my head. Ange was bringing the white makeup and had promised to do my eyeliner and black nail-polish. Why the hell not? When was the next time I was going to get to play dressup like this?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ange met me in front of her house. She had her backpack on too, and fishnet tights, a ruffled gothic lolita maid's dress, white face-paint, elaborate kabuki eye-makeup, and her fingers and throat dripped with silver jewelry.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You look <i class="calibre6">great</i>!" we said to each other in unison, then laughed quietly and stole off through the streets, spray-paint cans in our pockets.</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">As I surveyed Civic Center, I thought about what it would look like once 400 VampMobbers converged on it. I expected them in ten minutes, out front of City Hall. Already the big plaza teemed with commuters who neatly sidestepped the homeless people begging there.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I've always hated Civic Center. It's a collection of huge wedding-cake buildings: court houses, museums, and civic buildings like City Hall. The sidewalks are wide, the buildings are white. In the tourist guides to San Francisco, they manage to photograph it so that it looks like Epcot Center, futuristic and austere.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But on the ground, it's grimy and gross. Homeless people sleep on all the benches. The district is empty by 6PM except for drunks and druggies, because with only one kind of building there, there's no legit reason for people to hang around after the sun goes down. It's more like a mall than a neighborhood, and the only businesses there are bail-bondsmen and liquor stores, places that cater to the families of crooks on trial and the bums who make it their nighttime home.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I really came to understand all of this when I read an interview with an amazing old urban planner, a woman called Jane Jacobs who was the first person to really nail why it was wrong to slice cities up with freeways, stick all the poor people in housing projects, and use zoning laws to tightly control who got to do what where.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jacobs explained that real cities are organic and they have a lot of variety -- rich and poor, white and brown, Anglo and Mex, retail and residential and even industrial. A neighborhood like that has all kinds of people passing through it at all hours of the day or night, so you get businesses that cater to every need, you get people around all the time, acting like eyes on the street.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You've encountered this before. You go walking around some older part of some city and you find that it's full of the coolest looking stores, guys in suits and people in fashion-rags, upscale restaurants and funky cafes, a little movie theater maybe, houses with elaborate paint-jobs. Sure, there might be a Starbucks too, but there's also a neat-looking fruit market and a florist who appears to be three hundred years old as she snips carefully at the flowers in her windows. It's the opposite of a planned space, like a mall. It feels like a wild garden or even a woods: like it <i class="calibre6">grew</i>.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You couldn't get any further from that than Civic Center. I read an interview with Jacobs where she talked about the great old neighborhood they knocked down to build it. It had been just that kind of neighborhood, the kind of place that happened without permission or rhyme or reason.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jacobs said that she predicted that within a few years, Civic Center would be one of the worst neighborhoods in the city, a ghost-town at night, a place that sustained a thin crop of weedy booze shops and flea-pit motels. In the interview, she didn't seem very glad to have been vindicated; she sounded like she was talking about a dead friend when she described what Civic Center had become.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now it was rush hour and Civic Center was as busy as it could be. The Civic Center BART also serves as the major station for Muni trolley lines, and if you need to switch from one to another, that's where you do it. At 8AM, there were thousands of people coming up the stairs, going down the stairs, getting into and out of taxis and on and off buses. They got squeezed by DHS checkpoints by the different civic buildings, and routed around aggressive panhandlers. They all smelled like their shampoos and colognes, fresh out of the shower and armored in their work suits, swinging laptop bags and briefcases. At 8AM, Civic Center was business central.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And here came the vamps. A couple dozen coming down Van Ness, a couple dozen coming up Market. More coming from the other side of Market. More coming up from Van Ness. They slipped around the side of the buildings, wearing the white face-paint and the black eyeliner, black clothes, leather jackets, huge stompy boots. Fishnet fingerless gloves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They began to fill up the plaza. A few of the business people gave them passing glances and then looked away, not wanting to let these weirdos into their personal realities as they thought about whatever crap they were about to wade through for another eight hours. The vamps milled around, not sure when the game was on. They pooled together in large groups, like an oil spill in reverse, all this black gathering in one place. A lot of them sported old-timey hats, bowlers and toppers. Many of the girls were in full-on elegant gothic lolita maid costumes with huge platforms.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I tried to estimate the numbers. 200. Then, five minutes later, it was 300. 400. They were still streaming in. The vamps had brought friends.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone grabbed my ass. I spun around and saw Ange, laughing so hard she had to hold her thighs, bent double.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Look at them all, man, look at them all!" she gasped. The square was twice as crowded as it had been a few minutes ago. I had no idea how many Xnetters there were, but easily 1000 of them had just showed up to my little party. Christ.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The DHS and SFPD cops were starting to mill around, talking into their radios and clustering together. I heard a far-away siren.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"All right," I said, shaking Ange by the arm. "All right, let's <i class="calibre6">go</i>."</p>
<p class="calibre1">We both slipped off into the crowd and as soon as we encountered our first vamp, we both said, loudly, "Bite bite bite bite bite!" My victim was a stunned -- but cute -- girl with spider-webs drawn on her hands and smudged mascara running down her cheeks. She said, "Crap," and moved away, acknowledging that I'd gotten her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The call of "bite bite bite bite bite" had scrambled the other nearby vamps. Some of them were attacking each other, others were moving for cover, hiding out. I had my victim for the minute, so I skulked away, using mundanes for cover. All around me, the cry of "bite bite bite bite bite!" and shouts and laughs and curses.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The sound spread like a virus through the crowd. All the vamps knew the game was on now, and the ones who were clustered together were dropping like flies. They laughed and cussed and moved away, clueing the still-in vamps that the game was on. And more vamps were arriving by the second.</p>
<p class="calibre1">8:16. It was time to bag another vamp. I crouched low and moved through the legs of the straights as they headed for the BART stairs. They jerked back with surprise and swerved to avoid me. I had my eyes laser-locked on a set of black platform boots with steel dragons over the toes, and so I wasn't expecting it when I came face to face with another vamp, a guy of about 15 or 16, hair gelled straight back and wearing a PVC Marilyn Manson jacket draped with necklaces of fake tusks carved with intricate symbols.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bite bite bite --" he began, when one of the mundanes tripped over him and they both went sprawling. I leapt over to him and shouted "bite bite bite bite bite!" before he could untangle himself again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">More vamps were arriving. The suits were really freaking out. The game overflowed the sidewalk and moved into Van Ness, spreading up toward Market Street. Drivers honked, the trolleys made angry <i class="calibre6">ding</i>s. I heard more sirens, but now traffic was snarled in every direction.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was freaking <i class="calibre6">glorious</i>.</p>
<p class="calibre1">BITE BITE BITE BITE BITE!</p>
<p class="calibre1">The sound came from all around me. There were so many vamps there, playing so furiously, it was like a roar. I risked standing up and looking around and found that I was right in the middle of a giant crowd of vamps that went as far as I could see in every direction.</p>
<p class="calibre1">BITE BITE BITE BITE BITE!</p>
<p class="calibre1">This was even better than the concert in Dolores Park. That had been angry and rockin', but this was -- well, it was just <i class="calibre6">fun</i>. It was like going back to the playground, to the epic games of tag we'd play on lunch breaks when the sun was out, hundreds of people chasing each other around. The adults and the cars just made it more fun, more funny.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That's what it was: it was <i class="calibre6">funny</i>. We were all laughing now.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But the cops were really mobilizing now. I heard helicopters. Any second now, it would be over. Time for the endgame.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I grabbed a vamp.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Endgame: when the cops order us to disperse, pretend you've been gassed. Pass it on. What did I just say?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The vamp was a girl, tiny, so short I thought she was really young, but she must have been 17 or 18 from her face and the smile. "Oh, that's wicked," she said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What did I say?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Endgame: when the cops order us to disperse, pretend you've been gassed. Pass it on. What did I just say?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Right," I said. "Pass it on."</p>
<p class="calibre1">She melted into the crowd. I grabbed another vamp. I passed it on. He went off to pass it on.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Somewhere in the crowd, I knew Ange was doing this too. Somewhere in the crowd, there might be infiltrators, fake Xnetters, but what could they do with this knowledge? It's not like the cops had a choice. They were going to order us to disperse. That was guaranteed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I had to get to Ange. The plan was to meet at the Founder's Statue in the Plaza, but reaching it was going to be hard. The crowd wasn't moving anymore, it was <i class="calibre6">surging</i>, like the mob had in the way down to the BART station on the day the bombs went off. I struggled to make my way through it just as the PA underneath the helicopter switched on.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"THIS IS THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. YOU ARE ORDERED TO DISPERSE IMMEDIATELY."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Around me, hundreds of vamps fell to the ground, clutching their throats, clawing at their eyes, gasping for breath. It was easy to fake being gassed, we'd all had plenty of time to study the footage of the partiers in Mission Dolores Park going down under the pepper-spray clouds.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"DISPERSE IMMEDIATELY."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I fell to the ground, protecting my pack, reaching around to the red baseball hat folded into the waistband of my pants. I jammed it on my head and then grabbed my throat and made horrendous retching noises.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The only ones still standing were the mundanes, the salarymen who'd been just trying to get to their jobs. I looked around as best as I could at them as I choked and gasped.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"THIS IS THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. YOU ARE ORDERED TO DISPERSE IMMEDIATELY. DISPERSE IMMEDIATELY." The voice of god made my bowels ache. I felt it in my molars and in my femurs and my spine.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The salarymen were scared. They were moving as fast as they could, but in no particular direction. The helicopters seemed to be directly overhead no matter where you stood. The cops were wading into the crowd now, and they'd put on their helmets. Some had shields. Some had gas masks. I gasped harder.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then the salarymen were running. I probably would have run too. I watched a guy whip a $500 jacket off and wrap it around his face before heading south toward Mission, only to trip up and go sprawling. His curses joined the choking sounds.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This wasn't supposed to happen -- the choking was just supposed to freak people out and get them confused, not panic them into a stampede.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There were screams now, screams I recognized all too well from the night in the park. That was the sound of people who were scared spitless, running into each other as they tried like hell to get away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And then the air-raid sirens began.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I hadn't heard that sound since the bombs went off, but I would never forget it. It sliced through me and went straight into my balls, turning my legs into jelly on the way. It made me want to run away in a panic. I got to my feet, red cap on my head, thinking of only one thing: Ange. Ange and the Founders' Statue.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone was on their feet now, running in all directions, screaming. I pushed people out of my way, holding onto my pack and my hat, heading for Founders' Statue. Masha was looking for me, I was looking for Ange. Ange was out there.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I pushed and cursed. Elbowed someone. Someone came down on my foot so hard I felt something go <i class="calibre6">crunch</i> and I shoved him so he went down. He tried to get up and someone stepped on him. I shoved and pushed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then I reached out my arm to shove someone else and strong hands grabbed my wrist and my elbow in one fluid motion and brought my arm back around behind my back. It felt like my shoulder was about to wrench out of its socket, and I instantly doubled over, hollering, a sound that was barely audible over the din of the crowd, the thrum of the choppers, the wail of the sirens.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was brought back upright by the strong hands behind me, which steered me like a marionette. The hold was so perfect I couldn't even think of squirming. I couldn't think of the noise or the helicopter or Ange. All I could think of was moving the way that the person who had me wanted me to move. I was brought around so that I was face-to-face with the person.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a girl whose face was sharp and rodent-like, half-hidden by a giant pair of sunglasses. Over the sunglasses, a mop of bright pink hair, spiked out in all directions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You!" I said. I knew her. She'd taken a picture of me and threatened to rat me out to truant watch. That had been five minutes before the alarms started. She'd been the one, ruthless and cunning. We'd both run from that spot in the Tenderloin as the klaxon sounded behind us, and we'd both been picked up by the cops. I'd been hostile and they'd decided that I was an enemy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She -- Masha -- became their ally.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hello, M1k3y," she hissed in my ear, close as a lover. A shiver went up my back. She let go of my arm and I shook it out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Christ," I said. "You!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, me," she said. "The gas is gonna come down in about two minutes. Let's haul ass."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ange -- my girlfriend -- is by the Founders' Statue."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Masha looked over the crowd. "No chance," she said. "We try to make it there, we're doomed. The gas is coming down in two minutes, in case you missed it the first time."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I stopped moving. "I don't go without Ange," I said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She shrugged. "Suit yourself," she shouted in my ear. "Your funeral."</p>
<p class="calibre1">She began to push through the crowd, moving away, north, toward downtown. I continued to push for the Founders' Statue. A second later, my arm was back in the terrible lock and I was being swung around and propelled forward.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You know too much, jerk-off," she said. "You've seen my face. You're coming with me."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I screamed at her, struggled till it felt like my arm would break, but she was pushing me forward. My sore foot was agony with every step, my shoulder felt like it would break.</p>
<p class="calibre1">With her using me as a battering ram, we made good progress through the crowd. The whine of the helicopters changed and she gave me a harder push. "RUN!" she yelled. "Here comes the gas!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The crowd noise changed, too. The choking sounds and scream sounds got much, much louder. I'd heard that pitch of sound before. We were back in the park. The gas was raining down. I held my breath and <i class="calibre6">ran</i>.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We cleared the crowd and she let go of my arm. I shook it out. I limped as fast as I could up the sidewalk as the crowd thinned and thinned. We were heading towards a group of DHS cops with riot shields and helmets and masks. As we drew near them, they moved to block us, but Masha held up a badge and they melted away like she was Obi Wan Kenobi, saying "These aren't the droids you're looking for."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You goddamned <i class="calibre6">bitch</i>," I said as we sped up Market Street. "We have to go back for Ange."</p>
<p class="calibre1">She pursed her lips and shook her head. "I feel for you, buddy. I haven't seen my boyfriend in months. He probably thinks I'm dead. Fortunes of war. We go back for your Ange, we're dead. If we push on, we have a chance. So long as we have a chance, she has a chance. Those kids aren't all going to Gitmo. They'll probably take a few hundred in for questioning and send the rest home."</p>
<p class="calibre1">We were moving up Market Street now, past the strip joints where the little encampments of bums and junkies sat, stinking like open toilets. Masha guided me to a little alcove in the shut door of one of the strip places. She stripped off her jacket and turned it inside out -- the lining was a muted stripe pattern, and with the jacket's seams reversed, it hung differently. She produced a wool hat from her pocket and pulled it over her hair, letting it form a jaunty, off-center peak. Then she took out some make-up remover wipes and went to work on her face and fingernails. In a minute, she was a different woman.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wardrobe change," she said. "Now you. Lose the shoes, lose the jacket, lose the hat." I could see her point. The cops would be looking very carefully at anyone who looked like they'd been a part of the VampMob. I ditched the hat entirely -- I'd never liked ball caps. Then I jammed the jacket into my pack and got out a long-sleeved tee with a picture of Rosa Luxembourg on it and pulled it over my black tee. I let Masha wipe my makeup off and clean my nails and a minute later, I was clean.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Switch off your phone," she said. "You carrying any arphids?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I had my student card, my ATM card, my Fast Pass. They all went into a silvered bag she held out, which I recognized as a radio-proof Faraday pouch. But as she put them in her pocket, I realized I'd just turned my ID over to her. If she was on the other side...</p>
<p class="calibre1">The magnitude of what had just happened began to sink in. In my mind, I'd pictured having Ange with me at this point. Ange would make it two against one. Ange would help me see if there was something amiss. If Masha wasn't all she said she was.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Put these pebbles in your shoes before you put them on --"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's OK. I sprained my foot. No gait recognition program will spot me now."</p>
<p class="calibre1">She nodded once, one pro to another, and slung her pack. I picked up mine and we moved. The total time for the changeover was less than a minute. We looked and walked like two different people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked at her watch and shook her head. "Come on," she said. "We have to make our rendezvous. Don't think of running, either. You've got two choices now. Me, or jail. They'll be analyzing the footage from that mob for days, but once they're done, every face in it will go in a database. Our departure will be noted. We are both wanted criminals now."</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1"><span class="c10"><span xml:lang="zxx">ï»¿</span></span>She got us off Market Street on the next block, swinging back into the Tenderloin. I knew this neighborhood. This was where we'd gone hunting for an open WiFi access-point back on the day, playing Harajuku Fun Madness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where are we going?" I said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"We're about to catch a ride," she said. "Shut up and let me concentrate."</p>
<p class="calibre1">We moved fast, and sweat streamed down my face from under my hair, coursed down my back and slid down the crack of my ass and my thighs. My foot was <i class="calibre6">really</i> hurting and I was seeing the streets of San Francisco race by, maybe for the last time, ever.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It didn't help that we were ploughing straight uphill, moving for the zone where the seedy Tenderloin gives way to the nosebleed real-estate values of Nob Hill. My breath came in ragged gasps. She moved us mostly up narrow alleys, using the big streets just to get from one alley to the next.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We were just stepping into one such alley, Sabin Place, when someone fell in behind us and said, "Freeze right there." It was full of evil mirth. We stopped and turned around.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the mouth of the alley stood Charles, wearing a halfhearted VampMob outfit of black t-shirt and jeans and white face-paint. "Hello, Marcus," he said. "You going somewhere?" He smiled a huge, wet grin. "Who's your girlfriend?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What do you want, Charles?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, I've been hanging out on that traitorous Xnet ever since I spotted you giving out DVDs at school. When I heard about your VampMob, I thought I'd go along and hang around the edges, just to see if you showed up and what you did. You know what I saw?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I said nothing. He had his phone in his hand, pointed at us. Recording. Maybe ready to dial 911. Beside me, Masha had gone still as a board.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I saw you <i class="calibre6">leading</i> the damned thing. And I <i class="calibre6">recorded</i> it, Marcus. So now I'm going to call the cops and we're going to wait right here for them. And then you're going to go to pound-you-in-the-ass prison, for a long, long time."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Masha stepped forward.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Stop right there, chickie," he said. "I saw you get him away. I saw it all --"</p>
<p class="calibre1">She took another step forward and snatched the phone out of his hand, reaching behind her with her other hand and bringing it out holding a wallet open.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"DHS, dick-head," she said. "I'm DHS. I've been running this twerp back to his masters to see where he went. I <i class="calibre6">was</i> doing that. Now you've blown it. We have a name for that. We call it 'Obstruction of National Security.' You're about to hear that phrase a lot more often."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Charles took a step backward, his hands held up in front of him. He'd gone even paler under his makeup. "What? No! I mean -- I didn't know! I was trying to <i class="calibre6">help</i>!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The last thing we need is a bunch of high school Junior G-men 'helping' buddy. You can tell it to the judge."</p>
<p class="calibre1">He moved back again, but Masha was fast. She grabbed his wrist and twisted him into the same judo hold she'd had me in back at Civic Center. Her hand dipped back to her pockets and came out holding a strip of plastic, a handcuff strip, which she quickly wound around his wrists.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That was the last thing I saw as I took off running.</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">I made it as far as the other end of the alley before she caught up with me, tackling me from behind and sending me sprawling. I couldn't move very fast, not with my hurt foot and the weight of my pack. I went down in a hard face-plant and skidded, grinding my cheek into the grimy asphalt.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Jesus," she said. "You're a goddamned idiot. You didn't <i class="calibre6">believe</i> that, did you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">My heart thudded in my chest. She was on top of me and slowly she let me up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do I need to cuff you, Marcus?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I got to my feet. I hurt all over. I wanted to die.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come on," she said. "It's not far now."</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">'It' turned out to be a moving van on a Nob Hill side-street, a sixteen-wheeler the size of one of the ubiquitous DHS trucks that still turned up on San Francisco's street corners, bristling with antennas.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This one, though, said "Three Guys and a Truck Moving" on the side, and the three guys were very much in evidence, trekking in and out of a tall apartment building with a green awning. They were carrying crated furniture, neatly labeled boxes, loading them one at a time onto the truck and carefully packing them there.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She walked us around the block once, apparently unsatisfied with something, then, on the next pass, she made eye-contact with the man who was watching the van, an older black guy with a kidney-belt and heavy gloves. He had a kind face and he smiled at us as she led us quickly, casually up the truck's three stairs and into its depth. "Under the big table," he said. "We left you some space there."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The truck was more than half full, but there was a narrow corridor around a huge table with a quilted blanket thrown over it and bubble-wrap wound around its legs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Masha pulled me under the table. It was stuffy and still and dusty under there, and I suppressed a sneeze as we scrunched in among the boxes. The space was so tight that we were on top of each other. I didn't think that Ange would have fit in there.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bitch," I said, looking at Masha.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shut up. You should be licking my boots thanking me. You would have ended up in jail in a week, two tops. Not Gitmo-by-the-Bay. Syria, maybe. I think that's where they sent the ones they really wanted to disappear."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I put my head on my knees and tried to breathe deeply.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why would you do something so stupid as declaring war on the DHS anyway?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I told her. I told her about being busted and I told her about Darryl.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She patted her pockets and came up with a phone. It was Charles's. "Wrong phone." She came up with another phone. She turned it on and the glow from its screen filled our little fort. After fiddling for a second, she showed it to me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the picture she'd snapped of us, just before the bombs blew. It was the picture of Jolu and Van and me and --</p>
<p class="calibre1">Darryl.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was holding in my hand proof that Darryl had been with us minutes before we'd all gone into DHS custody. Proof that he'd been alive and well and in our company.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You need to give me a copy of this," I said. "I need it."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"When we get to LA," she said, snatching the phone back. "Once you've been briefed on how to be a fugitive without getting both our asses caught and shipped to Syria. I don't want you getting rescue ideas about this guy. He's safe enough where he is -- for now."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I thought about trying to take it from her by force, but she'd already demonstrated her physical skill. She must have been a black-belt or something.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We sat there in the dark, listening to the three guys load the truck with box after box, tying things down, grunting with the effort of it. I tried to sleep, but couldn't. Masha had no such problem. She snored.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was still light shining through the narrow, obstructed corridor that led to the fresh air outside. I stared at it, through the gloom, and thought of Ange.</p>
<p class="calibre1">My Ange. Her hair brushing her shoulders as she turned her head from side to side, laughing at something I'd done. Her face when I'd seen her last, falling down in the crowd at VampMob. All those people at VampMob, like the people in the park, down and writhing, the DHS moving in with truncheons. The ones who disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Darryl. Stuck on Treasure Island, his side stitched up, taken out of his cell for endless rounds of questioning about the terrorists.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Darryl's father, ruined and boozy, unshaven. Washed up and in his uniform, "for the photos." Weeping like a little boy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">My own father, and the way that he had been changed by my disappearance to Treasure Island. He'd been just as broken as Darryl's father, but in his own way. And his face, when I told him where I'd been.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That was when I knew that I couldn't run.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That was when I knew that I had to stay and fight.</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">Masha's breathing was deep and regular, but when I reached with glacial slowness into her pocket for her phone, she snuffled a little and shifted. I froze and didn't even breathe for a full two minutes, counting one hippopotami, two hippopotami.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowly, her breath deepened again. I tugged the phone free of her jacket-pocket one millimeter at a time, my fingers and arm trembling with the effort of moving so slowly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then I had it, a little candy-bar shaped thing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I turned to head for the light, when I had a flash of memory: Charles, holding out his phone, waggling it at us, taunting us. It had been a candy-bar-shaped phone, silver, plastered in the logos of a dozen companies that had subsidized the cost of the handset through the phone company. It was the kind of phone where you had to listen to a commercial every time you made a call.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was too dim to see the phone clearly in the truck, but I could feel it. Were those company decals on its sides? Yes? Yes. I had just stolen <i class="calibre6">Charles's</i> phone from Masha.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I turned back around slowly, slowly, and slowly, slowly, <i class="calibre6">slowly</i>, I reached back into her pocket. <i class="calibre6">Her</i> phone was bigger and bulkier, with a better camera and who knew what else?</p>
<p class="calibre1">I'd been through this once before -- that made it a little easier. Millimeter by millimeter again, I teased it free of her pocket, stopping twice when she snuffled and twitched.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I had the phone free of her pocket and I was beginning to back away when her hand shot out, fast as a snake, and grabbed my wrist, hard, fingertips grinding away at the small, tender bones below my hand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I gasped and stared into Masha's wide-open, staring eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You are such an idiot," she said, conversationally, taking the phone from me, punching at its keypad with her other hand. "How did you plan on unlocking this again?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I swallowed. I felt bones grind against each other in my wrist. I bit my lip to keep from crying out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She continued to punch away with her other hand. "Is this what you thought you'd get away with?" She showed me the picture of all of us, Darryl and Jolu, Van and me. "This picture?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I didn't say anything. My wrist felt like it would shatter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Maybe I should just delete it, take temptation out of your way." Her free hand moved some more. Her phone asked her if she was sure and she had to look at it to find the right button.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That's when I moved. I had Charles's phone in my other hand still, and I brought it down on her crushing hand as hard as I could, banging my knuckles on the table overhead. I hit her hand so hard the phone shattered and she yelped and her hand went slack. I was still moving, reaching for her other hand, for her now-unlocked phone with her thumb still poised over the OK key. Her fingers spasmed on the empty air as I snatched the phone out of her hand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I moved down the narrow corridor on hands and knees, heading for the light. I felt her hands slap at my feet and ankles twice, and I had to shove aside some of the boxes that had walled us in like a Pharaoh in a tomb. A few of them fell down behind me, and I heard Masha grunt again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The rolling truck door was open a crack and I dove for it, slithering out under it. The steps had been removed and I found myself hanging over the road, sliding headfirst into it, clanging my head off the blacktop with a thump that rang my ears like a gong. I scrambled to my feet, holding the bumper, and desperately dragged down on the door-handle, slamming it shut. Masha screamed inside -- I must have caught her fingertips. I felt like throwing up, but I didn't.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I padlocked the truck instead.</p>
<p class="c3">Chapter 20</p>
<p class="c5">This chapter is dedicated to The Tattered Cover, Denver's legendary independent bookstore. I happened upon The Tattered Cover quite by accident: Alice and I had just landed in Denver, coming in from London, and it was early and cold and we needed coffee. We drove in aimless rental-car circles, and that's when I spotted it, the Tattered Cover's sign. Something about it tingled in my hindbrain -- I knew I'd heard of this place. We pulled in (got a coffee) and stepped into the store -- a wonderland of dark wood, homey reading nooks, and miles and miles of bookshelves.</p>
<p class="c5"><a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">The Tattered Cover</a> 1628 16th St., Denver, CO USA 80202 +1 303 436 1070</p>
<p class="calibre1">None of the three guys were around at the moment, so I took off. My head hurt so much I thought I must be bleeding, but my hands came away dry. My twisted ankle had frozen up in the truck so that I ran like a broken marionette, and I stopped only once, to cancel the photo-deletion on Masha's phone. I turned off its radio -- both to save battery and to keep it from being used to track me -- and set the sleep timer to two hours, the longest setting available. I tried to set it to not require a password to wake from sleep, but that required a password itself. I was just going to have to tap the keypad at least once every two hours until I could figure out how to get the photo off of the phone. I would need a charger, then.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I didn't have a plan. I needed one. I needed to sit down, to get online -- to figure out what I was going to do next. I was sick of letting other people do my planning for me. I didn't want to be acting because of what Masha did, or because of the DHS, or because of my dad. Or because of Ange? Well, maybe I'd act because of Ange. That would be just fine, in fact.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I'd just been slipping downhill, taking alleys when I could, merging with the Tenderloin crowds. I didn't have any destination in mind. Every few minutes, I put my hand in my pocket and nudged one of the keys on Masha's phone to keep it from going asleep. It made an awkward bulge, unfolded there in my jacket.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I stopped and leaned against a building. My ankle was killing me. Where was I, anyway?</p>
<p class="calibre1">O'Farrell, at Hyde Street. In front of a dodgy "Asian Massage Parlor." My traitorous feet had taken me right back to the beginning -- taken me back to where the photo on Masha's phone had been taken, seconds before the Bay Bridge blew, before my life changed forever.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I wanted to sit down on the sidewalk and bawl, but that wouldn't solve my problems. I had to call Barbara Stratford, tell her what had happened. Show her the photo of Darryl.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What was I thinking? I had to show her the video, the one that Masha had sent me -- the one where the President's Chief of Staff gloated at the attacks on San Francisco and admitted that he knew when and where the next attacks would happen and that he wouldn't stop them because they'd help his man get re-elected.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That was a plan, then: get in touch with Barbara, give her the documents, and get them into print. The VampMob had to have really freaked people out, made them think that we really were a bunch of terrorists. Of course, when I'd been planning it, I had been thinking of how good a distraction it would be, not how it would look to some NASCAR Dad in Nebraska.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I'd call Barbara, and I'd do it smart, from a payphone, putting my hood up so that the inevitable CCTV wouldn't get a photo of me. I dug a quarter out of my pocket and polished it on my shirt-tail, getting the fingerprints off it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I headed downhill, down and down to the BART station and the payphones there. I made it to the trolley-car stop when I spotted the cover of the week's <i class="calibre6">Bay Guardian</i>, stacked in a high pile next to a homeless black guy who smiled at me. "Go ahead and read the cover, it's free -- it'll cost you fifty cents to look inside, though."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The headline was set in the biggest type I'd seen since 9/11:</p>
<p class="calibre1">INSIDE GITMO-BY-THE-BAY</p>
<p class="calibre1">Beneath it, in slightly smaller type:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"How the DHS has kept our children and friends in secret prisons on our doorstep.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"By Barbara Stratford, Special to the Bay Guardian"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The newspaper seller shook his head. "Can you believe that?" he said. "Right here in San Francisco. Man, the government <i class="calibre6">sucks</i>."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Theoretically, the <i class="calibre6">Guardian</i> was free, but this guy appeared to have cornered the local market for copies of it. I had a quarter in my hand. I dropped it into his cup and fished for another one. I didn't bother polishing the fingerprints off of it this time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"We're told that the world changed forever when the Bay Bridge was blown up by parties unknown. Thousands of our friends and neighbors died on that day. Almost none of them have been recovered; their remains are presumed to be resting in the city's harbor.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But an extraordinary story told to this reporter by a young man who was arrested by the DHS minutes after the explosion suggests that our own government has illegally held many of those thought dead on Treasure Island, which had been evacuated and declared off-limits to civilians shortly after the bombing..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I sat down on a bench -- the same bench, I noted with a prickly hair-up-the-neck feeling, where we'd rested Darryl after escaping from the BART station -- and read the article all the way through. It took a huge effort not to burst into tears right there. Barbara had found some photos of me and Darryl goofing around together and they ran alongside the text. The photos were maybe a year old, but I looked so much <i class="calibre6">younger</i> in them, like I was 10 or 11. I'd done a lot of growing up in the past couple months.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The piece was beautifully written. I kept feeling outraged on behalf of the poor kids she was writing about, then remembering that she was writing about <i class="calibre6">me</i>. Zeb's note was there, his crabbed handwriting reproduced in large, a half-sheet of the newspaper. Barbara had dug up more info on other kids who were missing and presumed dead, a long list, and asked how many had been stuck there on the island, just a few miles from their parents' doorsteps.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I dug another quarter out of my pocket, then changed my mind. What was the chance that Barbara's phone wasn't tapped? There was no way I was going to be able to call her now, not directly. I needed some intermediary to get in touch with her and get her to meet me somewhere south. So much for plans.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What I really, really needed was the Xnet.</p>
<p class="calibre1">How the hell was I going to get online? My phone's wifinder was blinking like crazy -- there was wireless all around me, but I didn't have an Xbox and a TV and a ParanoidXbox DVD to boot from. WiFi, WiFi everywhere...</p>
<p class="calibre1">That's when I spotted them. Two kids, about my age, moving among the crowd at the top of the stairs down into the BART.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What caught my eye was the way they were moving, kind of clumsy, nudging up against the commuters and the tourists. Each had a hand in his pocket, and whenever they met one another's eye, they snickered. They couldn't have been more obvious jammers, but the crowd was oblivious to them. Being down in that neighborhood, you expect to be dodging homeless people and crazies, so you don't make eye contact, don't look around at all if you can help it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I sidled up to one. He seemed really young, but he couldn't have been any younger than me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey," I said. "Hey, can you guys come over here for a second?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">He pretended not to hear me. He looked right through me, the way you would a homeless person.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come on," I said. "I don't have a lot of time." I grabbed his shoulder and hissed in his ear. "The cops are after me. I'm from Xnet."</p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked scared now, like he wanted to run away, and his friend was moving toward us. "I'm serious," I said. "Just hear me out."</p>
<p class="calibre1">His friend came over. He was taller, and beefy -- like Darryl. "Hey," he said. "Something wrong?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">His friend whispered in his ear. The two of them looked like they were going to bolt.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I grabbed my copy of the <i class="calibre6">Bay Guardian</i> from under my arm and rattled it in front of them. "Just turn to page 5, OK?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">They did. They looked at the headline. The photo. Me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, dude," the first one said. "We are <i class="calibre6">so</i> not worthy." He grinned at me like crazy, and the beefier one slapped me on the back.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No <i class="calibre6">way</i> --" he said. "You're M --"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I put a hand over his mouth. "Come over here, OK?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I brought them back to my bench. I noticed that there was something old and brown staining the sidewalk underneath it. Darryl's blood? It made my skin pucker up. We sat down.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm Marcus," I said, swallowing hard as I gave my real name to these two who already knew me as M1k3y. I was blowing my cover, but the <i class="calibre6">Bay Guardian</i> had already made the connection for me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nate," the small one said. "Liam," the bigger one said. "Dude, it is <i class="calibre6">such</i> an honor to meet you. You're like our all-time hero --"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't say that," I said. "Don't say that. You two are like a flashing advertisement that says, 'I am jamming, please put my ass in Gitmo-by-the-Bay. You couldn't be more obvious."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Liam looked like he might cry.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't worry, you didn't get busted. I'll give you some tips, later." He brightened up again. What was becoming weirdly clear was that these two really <i class="calibre6">did</i> idolize M1k3y, and that they'd do anything I said. They were grinning like idiots. It made me uncomfortable, sick to my stomach.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Listen, I need to get on Xnet, now, without going home or anywhere near home. Do you two live near here?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I do," Nate said. "Up at the top of California Street. It's a bit of a walk -- steep hills." I'd just walked all the way down them. Masha was somewhere up there. But still, it was better than I had any right to expect.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's go," I said.</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">Nate loaned me his baseball hat and traded jackets with me. I didn't have to worry about gait-recognition, not with my ankle throbbing the way it was -- I limped like an extra in a cowboy movie.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nate lived in a huge four-bedroom apartment at the top of Nob Hill. The building had a doorman, in a red overcoat with gold brocade, and he touched his cap and called Nate, "Mr Nate" and welcomed us all there. The place was spotless and smelled of furniture polish. I tried not to gawp at what must have been a couple million bucks' worth of condo.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"My dad," he explained. "He was an investment banker. Lots of life insurance. He died when I was 14 and we got it all. They'd been divorced for years, but he left my mom as beneficiary."</p>
<p class="calibre1">From the floor-to-ceiling window, you could see a stunning view of the other side of Nob Hill, all the way down to Fisherman's Wharf, to the ugly stub of the Bay Bridge, the crowd of cranes and trucks. Through the mist, I could just make out Treasure Island. Looking down all that way, it gave me a crazy urge to jump.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I got online with his Xbox and a huge plasma screen in the living room. He showed me how many open WiFi networks were visible from his high vantage point -- twenty, thirty of them. This was a good spot to be an Xnetter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a <i class="calibre6">lot</i> of email in my M1k3y account. 20,000 new messages since Ange and I had left her place that morning. Lots of it was from the press, asking for followup interviews, but most of it was from the Xnetters, people who'd seen the <i class="calibre6">Guardian</i> story and wanted to tell me that they'd do anything to help me, anything I needed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That did it. Tears started to roll down my cheeks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nate and Liam exchanged glances. I tried to stop, but it was no good. I was sobbing now. Nate went to an oak book-case on one wall and swung a bar out of one of its shelves, revealing gleaming rows of bottles. He poured me a shot of something golden brown and brought it to me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Rare Irish whiskey," he said. "Mom's favorite."</p>
<p class="calibre1">It tasted like fire, like gold. I sipped at it, trying not to choke. I didn't really like hard liquor, but this was different. I took several deep breaths.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thanks, Nate," I said. He looked like I'd just pinned a medal on him. He was a good kid.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"All right," I said, and picked up the keyboard. The two boys watched in fascination as I paged through my mail on the gigantic screen.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What I was looking for, first and foremost, was email from Ange. There was a chance that she'd just gotten away. There was always that chance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was an idiot to even hope. There was nothing from her. I started going through the mail as fast as I could, picking apart the press requests, the fan mail, the hate mail, the spam...</p>
<p class="calibre1">And that's when I found it: a letter from Zeb.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It wasn't nice to wake up this morning and find the letter that I thought you would destroy in the pages of the newspaper. Not nice at all. Made me feel -- hunted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But I've come to understand why you did it. I don't know if I can approve of your tactics, but it's easy to see that your motives were sound.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"If you're reading this, that means that there's a good chance you've gone underground. It's not easy. I've been learning that. I've been learning a lot more.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I can help you. I should do that for you. You're doing what you can for me. (Even if you're not doing it with my permission.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Reply if you get this, if you're on the run and alone. Or reply if you're in custody, being run by our friends on Gitmo, looking for a way to make the pain stop. If they've got you, you'll do what they tell you. I know that. I'll take that risk.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"For you, M1k3y."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wooooah," Liam breathed. "Duuuuude." I wanted to smack him. I turned to say something awful and cutting to him, but he was staring at me with eyes as big as saucers, looking like he wanted to drop to his knees and worship me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can I just say," Nate said, "can I just say that it is the biggest honor of my entire life to help you? Can I just say that?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was blushing now. There was nothing for it. These two were totally star-struck, even though I wasn't any kind of star, not in my own mind at least.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can you guys --" I swallowed. "Can I have some privacy here?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">They slunk out of the room like bad puppies and I felt like a tool. I typed fast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I got away, Zeb. And I'm on the run. I need all the help I can get. I want to end this now." I remembered to take Masha's phone out of my pocket and tickle it to keep it from going to sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They let me use the shower, gave me a change of clothes, a new backpack with half their earthquake kit in it -- energy bars, medicine, hot and cold packs, and an old sleeping-bag. They even slipped a spare Xbox Universal already loaded with ParanoidXbox on it into there. That was a nice touch. I had to draw the line at a flaregun.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I kept on checking my email to see if Zeb had replied. I answered the fan mail. I answered the mail from the press. I deleted the hate mail. I was half-expecting to see something from Masha, but chances were she was halfway to LA by now, her fingers hurt, and in no position to type. I tickled her phone again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They encouraged me to take a nap and for a brief, shameful moment, I got all paranoid like maybe these guys were thinking of turning me in once I was asleep. Which was idiotic -- they could have turned me in just as easily when I was awake. I just couldn't compute the fact that they thought <i class="calibre6">so much</i> of me. I had known, intellectually, that there were people who would follow M1k3y. I'd met some of those people that morning, shouting BITE BITE BITE and vamping it up at Civic Center. But these two were more personal. They were just nice, goofy guys, they coulda been any of my friends back in the days before the Xnet, just two pals who palled around having teenage adventures. They'd volunteered to join an army, my army. I had a responsibility to them. Left to themselves, they'd get caught, it was only a matter of time. They were too trusting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guys, listen to me for a second. I have something serious I need to talk to you about."</p>
<p class="calibre1">They almost stood at attention. It would have been funny if it wasn't so scary.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Here's the thing. Now that you've helped me, it's really dangerous. If you get caught, I'll get caught. They'll get anything you know out of you --" I held up my hand to forestall their protests. "No, stop. You haven't been through it. Everyone talks. Everyone breaks. If you're ever caught, you tell them everything, right away, as fast as you can, as much as you can. They'll get it all eventually anyway. That's how they work.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But you won't get caught, and here's why: you're not jammers anymore. You are retired from active duty. You're a --" I fished in my memory for vocabulary words culled from spy thrillers -- "you're a sleeper cell. Stand down. Go back to being normal kids. One way or another, I'm going to break this thing, break it wide open, end it. Or it will get me, finally, do me in. If you don't hear from me within 72 hours, assume that they got me. Do whatever you want then. But for the next three days -- and forever, if I do what I'm trying to do -- stand down. Will you promise me that?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">They promised with all solemnity. I let them talk me into napping, but made them swear to rouse me once an hour. I'd have to tickle Masha's phone and I wanted to know as soon as Zeb got back in touch with me.</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">The rendezvous was on a BART car, which made me nervous. They're full of cameras. But Zeb knew what he was doing. He had me meet him in the last car of a certain train departing from Powell Street Station, at a time when that car was filled with the press of bodies. He sidled up to me in the crowd, and the good commuters of San Francisco cleared a space for him, the hollow that always surrounds homeless people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nice to see you again," he muttered, facing into the doorway. Looking into the dark glass, I could see that there was no one close enough to eavesdrop -- not without some kind of high-efficiency mic rig, and if they knew enough to show up here with one of those, we were dead anyway.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You too, brother," I said. "I'm -- I'm sorry, you know?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shut up. Don't be sorry. You were braver than I am. Are you ready to go underground now? Ready to disappear?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"About that."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's not the plan."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh," he said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Listen, OK? I have -- I have pictures, video. Stuff that really <i class="calibre6">proves</i> something." I reached into my pocket and tickled Masha's phone. I'd bought a charger for it in Union Square on the way down, and had stopped and plugged it in at a cafe for long enough to get the battery up to four out of five bars. "I need to get it to Barbara Stratford, the woman from the <i class="calibre6">Guardian</i>. But they're going to be watching her -- watching to see if I show up."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You don't think that they'll be watching for me, too? If your plan involves me going within a mile of that woman's home or office --"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I want you to get Van to come and meet me. Did Darryl ever tell you about Van? The girl --"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"He told me. Yes, he told me. You don't think they'll be watching her? All of you who were arrested?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I think they will. I don't think they'll be watching her as hard. And Van has totally clean hands. She never cooperated with any of my --" I swallowed. "With my projects. So they might be a little more relaxed about her. If she calls the Bay Guardian to make an appointment to explain why I'm just full of crap, maybe they'll let her keep it."</p>
<p class="calibre1">He stared at the door for a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You know what happens when they catch us again." It wasn't a question.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are you sure? Some of the people that were on Treasure Island with us got taken away in helicopters. They got taken <i class="calibre6">offshore</i>. There are countries where America can outsource its torture. Countries where you will rot forever. Countries where you wish they would just get it over with, have you dig a trench and then shoot you in the back of the head as you stand over it."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I swallowed and nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is it worth the risk? We can go underground for a long, long time here. Someday we might get our country back. We can wait it out."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I shook my head. "You can't get anything done by doing nothing. It's our <i class="calibre6">country</i>. They've taken it from us. The terrorists who attack us are still free -- but <i class="calibre6">we're not</i>. I can't go underground for a year, ten years, my whole life, waiting for freedom to be handed to me. Freedom is something you have to take for yourself."</p>

<p class="calibre1">That afternoon, Van left school as usual, sitting in the back of the bus with a tight knot of her friends, laughing and joking the way she always did. The other riders on the bus took special note of her, she was so loud, and besides, she was wearing that stupid, giant floppy hat, something that looked like a piece out of a school play about Renaissance sword fighters. At one point they all huddled together, then turned away to look out the back of the bus, pointing and giggling. The girl who wore the hat now was the same height as Van, and from behind, it could be her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">No one paid any attention to the mousy little Asian girl who got off a few stops before the BART. She was dressed in a plain old school uniform, and looking down shyly as she stepped off. Besides, at that moment, the loud Korean girl let out a whoop and her friends followed along, laughing so loudly that even the bus driver slowed down, twisted in his seat and gave them a dirty look.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Van hurried away down the street with her head down, her hair tied back and dropped down the collar of her out-of-style bubble jacket. She had slipped lifts into her shoes that made her two wobbly, awkward inches taller, and had taken her contacts out and put on her least-favored glasses, with huge lenses that took up half her face. Although I'd been waiting in the bus-shelter for her and knew when to expect her, I hardly recognized her. I got up and walked along behind her, across the street, trailing by half a block.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The people who passed me looked away as quickly as possible. I looked like a homeless kid, with a grubby cardboard sign, street-grimy overcoat, huge, overstuffed knapsack with duct-tape over its rips. No one wants to look at a street-kid, because if you meet his eye, he might ask you for some spare change. I'd walked around Oakland all afternoon and the only person who'd spoken to me was a Jehovah's Witness and a Scientologist, both trying to convert me. It felt gross, like being hit on by a pervert.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Van followed the directions I'd written down carefully. Zeb had passed them to her the same way he'd given me the note outside school -- bumping into her as she waited for the bus, apologizing profusely. I'd written the note plainly and simply, just laying it out for her: I know you don't approve. I understand. But this is it, this is the most important favor I've ever asked of you. Please. Please.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She'd come. I knew she would. We had a lot of history, Van and I. She didn't like what had happened to the world, either. Besides, an evil, chuckling voice in my head had pointed out, she was under suspicion now that Barbara's article was out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We walked like that for six or seven blocks, looking at who was near us, what cars went past. Zeb told me about five-person trails, where five different undercovers traded off duties following you, making it nearly impossible to spot them. You had to go somewhere totally desolate, where anyone at all would stand out like a sore thumb.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The overpass for the 880 was just a few blocks from the Coliseum BART station, and even with all the circling Van did, it didn't take long to reach it. The noise from overhead was nearly deafening. No one else was around, not that I could tell. I'd visited the site before I suggested it to Van in the note, taking care to check for places where someone could hide. There weren't any.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Once she stopped at the appointed place, I moved quickly to catch up to her. She blinked owlishly at me from behind her glasses.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Marcus," she breathed, and tears swam in her eyes. I found that I was crying too. I'd make a really rotten fugitive. Too sentimental.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She hugged me so hard I couldn't breathe. I hugged her back even harder.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then she kissed me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Not on the cheek, not like a sister. Full on the lips, a hot, wet, steamy kiss that seemed to go on forever. I was so overcome with emotion --</p>
<p class="calibre1">No, that's bull. I knew exactly what I was doing. I kissed her back.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then I stopped and pulled away, nearly shoved her away. "Van," I gasped.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oops," she said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Van," I said again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sorry," she said. "I --"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Something occurred to me just then, something I guess I should have seen a long, long time before.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You <i class="calibre6">like</i> me, don't you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">She nodded miserably. "For years," she said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh, God. Darryl, all these years, so in love with her, and the whole time she was looking at me, secretly wanting me. And then I ended up with Ange. Ange said that she'd always fought with Van. And I was running around, getting into so much trouble.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Van," I said. "Van, I'm so sorry."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Forget it," she said, looking away. "I know it can't be. I just wanted to do that once, just in case I never --" She bit down on the words.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Van, I need you to do something for me. Something important. I need you to meet with the journalist from the Bay Guardian, Barbara Stratford, the one who wrote the article. I need you to give her something." I explained about Masha's phone, told her about the video that Masha had sent me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What good will this do, Marcus? What's the point?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Van, you were right, at least partly. We can't fix the world by putting other people at risk. I need to solve the problem by telling what I know. I should have done that from the start. Should have walked straight out of their custody and to Darryl's father's house and told him what I knew. Now, though, I have evidence. This stuff -- it could change the world. This is my last hope. The only hope for getting Darryl out, for getting a life that I don't spend underground, hiding from the cops. And you're the only person I can trust to do this."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why me?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're kidding, right? Look at how well you handled getting here. You're a pro. You're the best at this of any of us. You're the only one I can trust. That's why you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why not your friend Angie?" She said the name without any inflection at all, like it was a block of cement.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I looked down. "I thought you knew. They arrested her. She's in Gitmo -- on Treasure Island. She's been there for days now." I had been trying not to think about this, not to think about what might be happening to her. Now I couldn't stop myself and I started to sob. I felt a pain in my stomach, like I'd been kicked, and I pushed my hands into my middle to hold myself in. I folded there, and the next thing I knew, I was on my side in the rubble under the freeway, holding myself and crying.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Van knelt down by my side. "Give me the phone," she said, her voice an angry hiss. I fished it out of my pocket and passed it to her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Embarrassed, I stopped crying and sat up. I knew that snot was running down my face. Van was giving me a look of pure revulsion. "You need to keep it from going to sleep," I said. "I have a charger here." I rummaged in my pack. I hadn't slept all the way through the night since I acquired it. I set the phone's alarm to go off every 90 minutes and wake me up so that I could keep it from going to sleep. "Don't fold it shut, either."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"And the video?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's harder," I said. "I emailed a copy to myself, but I can't get onto the Xnet anymore." In a pinch, I could have gone back to Nate and Liam and used their Xbox again, but I didn't want to risk it. "Look, I'm going to give you my login and password for the Pirate Party's mail-server. You'll have to use Tor to access it -- Homeland Security is bound to be scanning for people logging into p-party mail."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your login and password," she said, looking a little surprised.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I trust you, Van. I know I can trust you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">She shook her head. "You <i class="calibre6">never</i> give out your passwords, Marcus."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't think it matters anymore. Either you succeed or I -- or it's the end of Marcus Yallow. Maybe I'll get a new identity, but I don't think so. I think they'll catch me. I guess I've known all along that they'd catch me, some day."</p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked at me, furious now. "What a waste. What was it all for, anyway?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of all the things she could have said, nothing could have hurt me more. It was like another kick in the stomach. What a waste, all of it, futile. Darryl and Ange, gone. I might never see my family again. And still, Homeland Security had my city and my country caught in a massive, irrational shrieking freak-out where anything could be done in the name of stopping terrorism.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Van looked like she was waiting for me to say something, but I had nothing to say to that. She left me there.</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">Zeb had a pizza for me when I got back "home" -- to the tent under a freeway overpass in the Mission that he'd staked out for the night. He had a pup tent, military surplus, stenciled with SAN FRANCISCO LOCAL HOMELESS COORDINATING BOARD.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The pizza was a Dominos, cold and clabbered, but delicious for all that. "You like pineapple on your pizza?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Zeb smiled condescendingly at me. "Freegans can't be choosy," he said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Freegans?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Like vegans, but we only eat free food."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Free food?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">He grinned again. "You know -- <i class="calibre6">free</i> food. From the free food store?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You stole this?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, dummy. It's from the other store. The little one out behind the store? Made of blue steel? Kind of funky smelling?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You got this out of the garbage?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">He flung his head back and cackled. "Yes indeedy. You should <i class="calibre6">see</i> your face. Dude, it's OK. It's not like it was rotten. It was fresh -- just a screwed up order. They threw it out in the box. They sprinkle rat poison over everything at closing-time, but if you get there quick, you're OK. You should see what grocery stores throw out! Wait until breakfast. I'm going to make you a fruit salad you won't believe. As soon as one strawberry in the box goes a little green and fuzzy, the whole thing is out --"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I tuned him out. The pizza was fine. It wasn't as if sitting in the dumpster would infect it or something. If it was gross, that was only because it came from Domino's -- the worst pizza in town. I'd never liked their food, and I'd given it up altogether when I found out that they bankrolled a bunch of ultra-crazy politicians who thought that global warming and evolution were satanic plots.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was hard to shake the feeling of grossness, though.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But there <i class="calibre6">was</i> another way to look at it. Zeb had showed me a secret, something I hadn't anticipated: there was a whole hidden world out there, a way of getting by without participating in the system.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Freegans, huh?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yogurt, too," he said, nodding vigorously. "For the fruit salad. They throw it out the day after the best-before date, but it's not as if it goes green at midnight. It's yogurt, I mean, it's basically just rotten milk to begin with."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I swallowed. The pizza tasted funny. Rat poison. Spoiled yogurt. Furry strawberries. This would take some getting used to.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I ate another bite. Actually, Domino's pizza sucked a little less when you got it for free.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Liam's sleeping bag was warm and welcoming after a long, emotionally exhausting day. Van would have made contact with Barbara by now. She'd have the video and the picture. I'd call her in the morning and find out what she thought I should do next. I'd have to come in once she published, to back it all up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I thought about that as I closed my eyes, thought about what it would be like to turn myself in, the cameras all rolling, following the infamous M1k3y into one of those big, columnated buildings in Civic Center.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The sound of the cars screaming by overhead turned into a kind of ocean sound as I drifted away. There were other tents nearby, homeless people. I'd met a few of them that afternoon, before it got dark and we all retreated to huddle near our own tents. They were all older than me, rough looking and gruff. None of them looked crazy or violent, though. Just like people who'd had bad luck, or made bad decisions, or both.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I must have fallen asleep, because I don't remember anything else until a bright light was shined into my face, so bright it was blinding.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's him," said a voice behind the light.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bag him," said another voice, one I'd heard before, one I'd heard over and over again in my dreams, lecturing to me, demanding my passwords. Severe-haircut-woman.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The bag went over my head quickly and was cinched so tight at the throat that I choked and threw up my freegan pizza. As I spasmed and choked, hard hands bound my wrists, then my ankles. I was rolled onto a stretcher and hoisted, then carried into a vehicle, up a couple of clanging metal steps. They dropped me into a padded floor. There was no sound at all in the back of the vehicle once they closed the doors. The padding deadened everything except my own choking.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, hello again," she said. I felt the van rock as she crawled in with me. I was still choking, trying to gasp in a breath. Vomit filled my mouth and trickled down my windpipe.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"We won't let you die," she said. "If you stop breathing, we'll make sure you start again. So don't worry about it."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I choked harder. I sipped at air. Some was getting through. Deep, wracking coughs shook my chest and back, dislodging some more of the puke. More breath.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"See?" she said. "Not so bad. Welcome home, M1k3y. We've got somewhere very special to take you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I relaxed onto my back, feeling the van rock. The smell of used pizza was overwhelming at first, but as with all strong stimuli, my brain gradually grew accustomed to it, filtered it out until it was just a faint aroma. The rocking of the van was almost comforting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That's when it happened. An incredible, deep calm that swept over me like I was lying on the beach and the ocean had swept in and lifted me as gently as a parent, held me aloft and swept me out onto a warm sea under a warm sun. After everything that had happened, I was caught, but it didn't matter. I had gotten the information to Barbara. I had organized the Xnet. I had won. And if I hadn't won, I had done everything I could have done. More than I ever thought I could do. I took a mental inventory as I rode, thinking of everything that I had accomplished, that <i class="calibre6">we</i> had accomplished. The city, the country, the world was full of people who wouldn't live the way DHS wanted us to live. We'd fight forever. They couldn't jail us all.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I sighed and smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She'd been talking all along, I realized. I'd been so far into my happy place that she'd just gone away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"-- smart kid like you. You'd think that you'd know better than to mess with us. We've had an eye on you since the day you walked out. We would have caught you even if you hadn't gone crying to your lesbo journalist traitor. I just don't get it -- we had an understanding, you and me..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">We rumbled over a metal plate, the van's shocks rocking, and then the rocking changed. We were on water. Heading to Treasure Island. Hey, Ange was there. Darryl, too. Maybe.</p>
