<p class="calibre1">"I thought you relied on my judgment, that you didn't want to spy on me." He'd said this often enough. "Do you really want me to account for every trip I've ever taken?"</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">I hooked up my Xbox as soon as I got to my room. I'd bolted the projector to the ceiling so that it could shine on the wall over my bed (I'd had to take down my awesome mural of punk rock handbills I'd taken down off telephone poles and glued to big sheets of white paper).</p>
<p class="calibre1">I powered up the Xbox and watched as it came onto the screen. I was going to email Van and Jolu to tell them about the hassles with the cops, but as I put my fingers to the keyboard, I stopped again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A feeling crept over me, one not unlike the feeling I'd had when I realized that they'd turned poor old Salmagundi into a traitor. This time, it was the feeling that my beloved Xnet might be broadcasting the location of every one of its users to the DHS.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was what Dad had said: <i class="calibre6">You ask the computer to create a profile of an average record in a database and then ask it to find out which records in the database are furthest away from average</i>.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Xnet was secure because its users weren't directly connected to the Internet. They hopped from Xbox to Xbox until they found one that was connected to the Internet, then they injected their material as undecipherable, encrypted data. No one could tell which of the Internet's packets were Xnet and which ones were just plain old banking and e-commerce and other encrypted communication. You couldn't find out who was tying the Xnet, let alone who was using the Xnet.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But what about Dad's "Bayesian statistics?" I'd played with Bayesian math before. Darryl and I once tried to write our own better spam filter and when you filter spam, you need Bayesian math. Thomas Bayes was an 18th century British mathematician that no one cared about until a couple hundred years after he died, when computer scientists realized that his technique for statistically analyzing mountains of data would be super-useful for the modern world's info-Himalayas.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Here's some of how Bayesian stats work. Say you've got a bunch of spam. You take every word that's in the spam and count how many times it appears. This is called a "word frequency histogram" and it tells you what the probability is that any bag of words is likely to be spam. Now, take a ton of email that's not spam -- in the biz, they call that "ham" -- and do the same.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wait until a new email arrives and count the words that appear in it. Then use the word-frequency histogram in the candidate message to calculate the probability that it belongs in the "spam" pile or the "ham" pile. If it turns out to be spam, you adjust the "spam" histogram accordingly. There are lots of ways to refine the technique -- looking at words in pairs, throwing away old data -- but this is how it works at core. It's one of those great, simple ideas that seems obvious after you hear about it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It's got lots of applications -- you can ask a computer to count the lines in a picture and see if it's more like a "dog" line-frequency histogram or a "cat" line-frequency histogram. It can find porn, bank fraud, and flamewars. Useful stuff.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And it was bad news for the Xnet. Say you had the whole Internet wiretapped -- which, of course, the DHS has. You can't tell who's passing Xnet packets by looking at the contents of those packets, thanks to crypto.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What you <i class="calibre6">can</i> do is find out who is sending way, way more encrypted traffic out than everyone else. For a normal Internet surfer, a session online is probably about 95 percent cleartext, five percent ciphertext. If someone is sending out 95 percent ciphertext, maybe you could dispatch the computer-savvy equivalents of Booger and Zit to ask them if they're terrorist drug-dealer Xnet users.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This happens all the time in China. Some smart dissident will get the idea of getting around the Great Firewall of China, which is used to censor the whole country's Internet connection, by using an encrypted connection to a computer in some other country. Now, the Party there can't tell what the dissident is surfing: maybe it's porn, or bomb-making instructions, or dirty letters from his girlfriend in the Philippines, or political material, or good news about Scientology. They don't have to know. All they have to know is that this guy gets way more encrypted traffic than his neighbors. At that point, they send him to a forced labor camp just to set an example so that everyone can see what happens to smart-asses.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So far, I was willing to bet that the Xnet was under the DHS's radar, but it wouldn't be the case forever. And after tonight, I wasn't sure that I was in any better shape than a Chinese dissident. I was putting all the people who signed onto the Xnet in jeopardy. The law didn't care if you were actually doing anything bad; they were willing to put you under the microscope just for being statistically abnormal. And I couldn't even stop it -- now that the Xnet was running, it had a life of its own.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was going to have to fix it some other way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I wished I could talk to Jolu about this. He worked at an Internet Service Provider called Pigspleen Net that had hired him when he was twelve, and he knew way more about the net than I did. If anyone knew how to keep our butts out of jail, it would be him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Luckily, Van and Jolu and I were planning to meet for coffee the next night at our favorite place in the Mission after school. Officially, it was our weekly Harajuku Fun Madness team meeting, but with the game canceled and Darryl gone, it was pretty much just a weekly weep-fest, supplemented by about six phone-calls and IMs a day that went, "Are you OK? Did it really happen?" It would be good to have something else to talk about.</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">"You're out of your mind," Vanessa said. "Are you actually, totally, really, for-real crazy or what?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">She had shown up in her girl's school uniform because she'd been stuck going the long way home, all the way down to the San Mateo bridge then back up into the city, on a shuttle-bus service that her school was operating. She hated being seen in public in her gear, which was totally Sailor Moon -- a pleated skirt and a tunic and knee-socks. She'd been in a bad mood ever since she turned up at the cafe, which was full of older, cooler, mopey emo art students who snickered into their lattes when she turned up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What do you want me to do, Van?" I said. I was getting exasperated myself. School was unbearable now that the game wasn't on, now that Darryl was missing. All day long, in my classes, I consoled myself with the thought of seeing my team, what was left of it. Now we were fighting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I want you to stop putting yourself at risk, M1k3y." The hairs on the back of my neck stood up. Sure, we always used our team handles at team meetings, but now that my handle was also associated with my Xnet use, it scared me to hear it said aloud in a public place.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't use that name in public anymore," I snapped.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Van shook her head. "That's just what I'm talking about. You could end up going to jail for this, Marcus, and not just you. Lots of people. After what happened to Darryl --"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm doing this for Darryl!" Art students swiveled to look at us and I lowered my voice. "I'm doing this because the alternative is to let them get away with it all."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You think you're going to stop them? You're out of your mind. They're the government."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's still our country," I said. "We still have the right to do this."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Van looked like she was going to cry. She took a couple of deep breaths and stood up. "I can't do it, I'm sorry. I can't watch you do this. It's like watching a car-wreck in slow motion. You're going to destroy yourself, and I love you too much to watch it happen."</p>
<p class="calibre1">She bent down and gave me a fierce hug and a hard kiss on the cheek that caught the edge of my mouth. "Take care of yourself, Marcus," she said. My mouth burned where her lips had pressed it. She gave Jolu the same treatment, but square on the cheek. Then she left.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jolu and I stared at each other after she'd gone.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I put my face in my hands. "Dammit," I said, finally.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jolu patted me on the back and ordered me another latte. "It'll be OK," he said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You'd think Van, of all people, would understand." Half of Van's family lived in North Korea. Her parents never forgot that they had all those people living under a crazy dictator, not able to escape to America, the way her parents had.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jolu shrugged. "Maybe that's why she's so freaked out. Because she knows how dangerous it can get."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I knew what he was talking about. Two of Van's uncles had gone to jail and had never reappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah," I said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So how come you weren't on Xnet last night?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was grateful for the distraction. I explained it all to him, the Bayesian stuff and my fear that we couldn't go on using Xnet the way we had been without getting nabbed. He listened thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I see what you're saying. The problem is that if there's too much crypto in someone's Internet connection, they'll stand out as unusual. But if you don't encrypt, you'll make it easy for the bad guys to wiretap you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah," I said. "I've been trying to figure it out all day. Maybe we could slow the connection down, spread it out over more peoples' accounts --"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Won't work," he said. "To get it slow enough to vanish into the noise, you'd have to basically shut down the network, which isn't an option."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're right," I said. "But what else can we do?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What if we changed the definition of normal?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">And that was why Jolu got hired to work at Pigspleen when he was 12. Give him a problem with two bad solutions and he'd figure out a third totally different solution based on throwing away all your assumptions. I nodded vigorously. "Go on, tell me."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What if the average San Francisco Internet user had a <i class="calibre6">lot</i> more crypto in his average day on the Internet? If we could change the split so it's more like fifty-fifty cleartext to ciphertext, then the users that supply the Xnet would just look like normal."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But how do we do that? People just don't care enough about their privacy to surf the net through an encrypted link. They don't see why it matters if eavesdroppers know what they're googling for."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah, but web-pages are small amounts of traffic. If we got people to routinely download a few giant encrypted files every day, that would create as much ciphertext as thousands of web-pages."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're talking about indienet," I said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You got it," he said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">indienet -- all lower case, always -- was the thing that made Pigspleen Net into one of the most successful independent ISPs in the world. Back when the major record labels started suing their fans for downloading their music, a lot of the independent labels and their artists were aghast. How can you make money by suing your customers?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pigspleen's founder had the answer: she opened up a deal for any act that wanted to work with their fans instead of fighting them. Give Pigspleen a license to distribute your music to its customers and it would give you a share of the subscription fees based on how popular your music was. For an indie artist, the big problem isn't piracy, it's obscurity: no one even cares enough about your tunes to steal 'em.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It worked. Hundreds of independent acts and labels signed up with Pigspleen, and the more music there was, the more fans switched to getting their Internet service from Pigspleen, and the more money there was for the artists. Inside of a year, the ISP had a hundred thousand new customers and now it had a million -- more than half the broadband connections in the city.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"An overhaul of the indienet code has been on my plate for months now," Jolu said. "The original programs were written really fast and dirty and they could be made a lot more efficient with a little work. But I just haven't had the time. One of the high-marked to-do items has been to encrypt the connections, just because Trudy likes it that way." Trudy Doo was the founder of Pigspleen. She was an old time San Francisco punk legend, the singer/front-woman of the anarcho-feminist band Speedwhores, and she was crazy about privacy. I could totally believe that she'd want her music service encrypted on general principles.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Will it be hard? I mean, how long would it take?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, there's tons of crypto code for free online, of course," Jolu said. He was doing the thing he did when he was digging into a meaty code problem -- getting that faraway look, drumming his palms on the table, making the coffee slosh into the saucers. I wanted to laugh -- everything might be destroyed and crap and scary, but Jolu would write that code.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can I help?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked at me. "What, you don't think I can manage it?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I mean, you did this whole Xnet thing without even telling me. Without talking to me. I kind of thought that you didn't need my help with this stuff."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was brought up short. "What?" I said again. Jolu was looking really steamed now. It was clear that this had been eating him for a long time. "Jolu --"</p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked at me and I could see that he was furious. How had I missed this? God, I was such an idiot sometimes. "Look dude, it's not a big deal --" by which he clearly meant that it was a really big deal "-- it's just that you know, you never even <i class="calibre6">asked</i>. I hate the DHS. Darryl was my friend too. I could have really helped with it."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I wanted to stick my head between my knees. "Listen Jolu, that was really stupid of me. I did it at like two in the morning. I was just crazy when it was happening. I --" I couldn't explain it. Yeah, he was right, and that was the problem. It had been two in the morning but I could have talked to Jolu about it the next day or the next. I hadn't because I'd known what he'd say -- that it was an ugly hack, that I needed to think it through better. Jolu was always figuring out how to turn my 2 AM ideas into real code, but the stuff that he came out with was always a little different from what I'd come up with. I'd wanted the project for myself. I'd gotten totally into being M1k3y.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry," I said at last. "I'm really, really sorry. You're totally right. I just got freaked out and did something stupid. I really need your help. I can't make this work without you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You mean it?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of course I mean it," I said. "You're the best coder I know. You're a goddamned genius, Jolu. I would be honored if you'd help me with this."</p>
<p class="calibre1">He drummed his fingers some more. "It's just -- You know. You're the leader. Van's the smart one. Darryl was... He was your second-in-command, the guy who had it all organized, who watched the details. Being the programmer, that was <i class="calibre6">my</i> thing. It felt like you were saying you didn't need me."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh man, I am such an idiot. Jolu, you're the best-qualified person I know to do this. I'm really, really, really --"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"All right, already. Stop. Fine. I believe you. We're all really screwed up right now. So yeah, of course you can help. We can probably even pay you -- I've got a little budget for contract programmers."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Really?" No one had ever paid me for writing code.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sure. You're probably good enough to be worth it." He grinned and slugged me in the shoulder. Jolu's really easy-going most of the time, which is why he'd freaked me out so much.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I paid for the coffees and we went out. I called my parents and let them know what I was doing. Jolu's mom insisted on making us sandwiches. We locked ourselves in his room with his computer and the code for indienet and we embarked on one of the great all-time marathon programming sessions. Once Jolu's family went to bed around 11:30, we were able to kidnap the coffee-machine up to his room and go IV with our magic coffee bean supply.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If you've never programmed a computer, you should. There's nothing like it in the whole world. When you program a computer, it does <i class="calibre6">exactly</i> what you tell it to do. It's like designing a machine -- any machine, like a car, like a faucet, like a gas-hinge for a door -- using math and instructions. It's awesome in the truest sense: it can fill you with awe.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A computer is the most complicated machine you'll ever use. It's made of billions of micro-miniaturized transistors that can be configured to run any program you can imagine. But when you sit down at the keyboard and write a line of code, those transistors do what you tell them to.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of us will never build a car. Pretty much none of us will ever create an aviation system. Design a building. Lay out a city.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Those are complicated machines, those things, and they're off-limits to the likes of you and me. But a computer is like, ten times more complicated, and it will dance to any tune you play. You can learn to write simple code in an afternoon. Start with a language like Python, which was written to give non-programmers an easier way to make the machine dance to their tune. Even if you only write code for one day, one afternoon, you have to do it. Computers can control you or they can lighten your work -- if you want to be in charge of your machines, you have to learn to write code.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We wrote a lot of code that night.</p>
<p class="c3">Chapter 8</p>
<p class="c5">This chapter is dedicated to Borders, the global bookselling giant that you can find in cities all over the world -- I'll never forget walking into the gigantic Borders on Orchard Road in Singapore and discovering a shelf loaded with my novels! For many years, the Borders in Oxford Street in London hosted Pat Cadigan's monthly science fiction evenings, where local and visiting authors would read their work, speak about science fiction and meet their fans. When I'm in a strange city (which happens a lot) and I need a great book for my next flight, there always seems to be a Borders brimming with great choices -- I'm especially partial to the Borders on Union Square in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="c5"><a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Borders worldwide</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">I wasn't the only one who got screwed up by the histograms. There are lots of people who have abnormal traffic patterns, abnormal usage patterns. Abnormal is so common, it's practically normal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Xnet was full of these stories, and so were the newspapers and the TV news. Husbands were caught cheating on their wives; wives were caught cheating on their husbands, kids were caught sneaking out with illicit girlfriends and boyfriends. A kid who hadn't told his parents he had AIDS got caught going to the clinic for his drugs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Those were the people with something to hide -- not guilty people, but people with secrets. There were even more people with nothing to hide at all, but who nevertheless resented being picked up, and questioned. Imagine if someone locked you in the back of a police car and demanded that you prove that you're <i class="calibre6">not</i> a terrorist.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It wasn't just public transit. Most drivers in the Bay Area have a FasTrak pass clipped to their sun-visors. This is a little radio-based "wallet" that pays your tolls for you when you cross the bridges, saving you the hassle of sitting in a line for hours at the toll-plazas. They'd tripled the cost of using cash to get across the bridge (though they always fudged this, saying that FasTrak was cheaper, not that anonymous cash was more expensive). Whatever holdouts were left afterward disappeared after the number of cash-lanes was reduced to just one per bridge-head, so that the cash lines were even longer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So if you're a local, or if you're driving a rental car from a local agency, you've got a FasTrak. It turns out that toll-plazas aren't the only place that your FasTrak gets read, though. The DHS had put FasTrak readers all over town -- when you drove past them, they logged the time and your ID number, building an ever-more perfect picture of who went where, when, in a database that was augmented by "speeding cameras," "red light cameras" and all the other license-plate cameras that had popped up like mushrooms.</p>
<p class="calibre1">No one had given it much thought. And now that people were paying attention, we were all starting to notice little things, like the fact that the FasTrak doesn't have an off-switch.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So if you drove a car, you were just as likely to be pulled over by an SFPD cruiser that wanted to know why you were taking so many trips to the Home Depot lately, and what was that midnight drive up to Sonoma last week about?</p>
<p class="calibre1">The little demonstrations around town on the weekend were growing. Fifty thousand people marched down Market Street after a week of this monitoring. I couldn't care less. The people who'd occupied my city didn't care what the natives wanted. They were a conquering army. They knew how we felt about that.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One morning I came down to breakfast just in time to hear Dad tell Mom that the two biggest taxi companies were going to give a "discount" to people who used special cards to pay their fares, supposedly to make drivers safer by reducing the amount of cash they carried. I wondered what would happen to the information about who took which cabs where.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I realized how close I'd come. The new indienet client had been pushed out as an automatic update just as this stuff started to get bad, and Jolu told me that 80 percent of the traffic he saw at Pigspleen was now encrypted. The Xnet just might have been saved.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad was driving me nuts, though.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're being paranoid, Marcus," he told me over breakfast one day as I told him about the guys I'd seen the cops shaking down on BART the day before.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Dad, it's ridiculous. They're not catching any terrorists, are they? It's just making people scared."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"They may not have caught any terrorists yet, but they're sure getting a lot of scumbags off the streets. Look at the drug dealers -- it says they've put dozens of them away since this all started. Remember when those druggies robbed you? If we don't bust their dealers, it'll only get worse." I'd been mugged the year before. They'd been pretty civilized about it. One skinny guy who smelled bad told me he had a gun, the other one asked me for my wallet. They even let me keep my ID, though they got my debit card and Fast Pass. It had still scared me witless and left me paranoid and checking my shoulder for weeks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But most of the people they hold up aren't doing anything wrong, Dad," I said. This was getting to me. My own father! "It's crazy. For every guilty person they catch, they have to punish thousands of innocent people. That's just not good."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Innocent? Guys cheating on their wives? Drug dealers? You're defending them, but what about all the people who died? If you don't have anything to hide --"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So you wouldn't mind if they pulled <i class="calibre6">you</i> over?" My dad's histograms had proven to be depressingly normal so far.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'd consider it my duty," he said. "I'd be proud. It would make me feel safer."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Easy for him to say.</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">Vanessa didn't like me talking about this stuff, but she was too smart about it for me to stay away from the subject for long. We'd get together all the time, and talk about the weather and school and stuff, and then, somehow, I'd be back on this subject. Vanessa was cool when it happened -- she didn't Hulk out on me again -- but I could see it upset her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Still.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So my dad says, 'I'd consider it my duty.' Can you freaking <i class="calibre6">believe</i> it? I mean, God! I almost told him then about going to jail, asking him if he thought that was our 'duty'!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">We were sitting in the grass in Dolores Park after school, watching the dogs chase frisbees.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Van had stopped at home and changed into an old t-shirt for one of her favorite Brazilian tecno-brega bands, Carioca Proibidão -- the forbidden guy from Rio. She'd gotten the shirt at a live show we'd all gone to two years before, sneaking out for a grand adventure down at the Cow Palace, and she'd sprouted an inch or two since, so it was tight and rode up her tummy, showing her flat little belly button.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She lay back in the weak sun with her eyes closed behind her shades, her toes wiggling in her flip-flops. I'd known Van since forever, and when I thought of her, I usually saw the little kid I'd known with hundreds of jangly bracelets made out of sliced-up soda cans, who played the piano and couldn't dance to save her life. Sitting out there in Dolores Park, I suddenly saw her as she was.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She was totally h4wt -- that is to say, hot. It was like looking at that picture of a vase and noticing that it was also two faces. I could see that Van was just Van, but I could also see that she was hella pretty, something I'd never noticed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, Darryl had known it all along, and don't think that I wasn't bummed out anew when I realized this.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You can't tell your dad, you know," she said. "You'd put us all at risk." Her eyes were closed and her chest was rising up and down with her breath, which was distracting in a really embarrassing way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah," I said, glumly. "But the problem is that I know he's just totally full of it. If you pulled my dad over and made him prove he wasn't a child-molesting, drug-dealing terrorist, he'd go berserk. Totally off-the-rails. He hates being put on hold when he calls about his credit-card bill. Being locked in the back of a car and questioned for an hour would give him an aneurism."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"They only get away with it because the normals feel smug compared to the abnormals. If everyone was getting pulled over, it'd be a disaster. No one would ever get anywhere, they'd all be waiting to get questioned by the cops. Total gridlock."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Woah.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Van, you are a total genius," I said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tell me about it," she said. She had a lazy smile and she looked at me through half-lidded eyes, almost romantic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Seriously. We can do this. We can mess up the profiles easily. Getting people pulled over is easy."</p>
<p class="calibre1">She sat up and pushed her hair off her face and looked at me. I felt a little flip in my stomach, thinking that she was really impressed with me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's the arphid cloners," I said. "They're totally easy to make. Just flash the firmware on a ten-dollar Radio Shack reader/writer and you're done. What we do is go around and randomly swap the tags on people, overwriting their Fast Passes and FasTraks with other people's codes. That'll make <i class="calibre6">everyone</i> skew all weird and screwy, and make everyone look guilty. Then: total gridlock."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Van pursed her lips and lowered her shades and I realized she was so angry she couldn't speak.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good bye, Marcus," she said, and got to her feet. Before I knew it, she was walking away so fast she was practically running.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Van!" I called, getting to my feet and chasing after her. "Van! Wait!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">She picked up speed, making me run to catch up with her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Van, what the hell," I said, catching her arm. She jerked it away so hard I punched myself in the face.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're psycho, Marcus. You're going to put all your little Xnet buddies in danger for their lives, and on top of it, you're going to turn the whole city into terrorism suspects. Can't you stop before you hurt these people?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I opened and closed my mouth a couple times. "Van, <i class="calibre6">I'm</i> not the problem, <i class="calibre6">they</i> are. I'm not arresting people, jailing them, making them disappear. The Department of Homeland Security are the ones doing that. I'm fighting back to make them stop."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"How, by making it worse?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Maybe it has to get worse to get better, Van. Isn't that what you were saying? If everyone was getting pulled over --"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's not what I meant. I didn't mean you should get everyone arrested. If you want to protest, join the protest movement. Do something positive. Didn't you learn <i class="calibre6">anything</i> from Darryl? <i class="calibre6">Anything?</i>"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're damned right I did," I said, losing my cool. "I learned that they can't be trusted. That if you're not fighting them, you're helping them. That they'll turn the country into a prison if we let them. What did you learn, Van? To be scared all the time, to sit tight and keep your head down and hope you don't get noticed? You think it's going to get better? If we don't do anything, this is as <i class="calibre6">good as it's going to get</i>. It will only get worse and worse from now on. You want to help Darryl? Help me bring them down!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">There it was again. My vow. Not to get Darryl free, but to bring down the entire DHS. That was crazy, even I knew it. But it was what I planned to do. No question about it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Van shoved me hard with both hands. She was strong from school athletics -- fencing, lacrosse, field hockey, all the girls-school sports -- and I ended up on my ass on the disgusting San Francisco sidewalk. She took off and I didn't follow.</p>

<p class="calibre1">I pasted in my HOWTO for building a arphid cloner, and some tips for getting close enough to people to read and write their tags. I put my own cloner in the pocket of my vintage black leather motocross jacket with the armored pockets and left for school. I managed to clone six tags between home and Chavez High.</p>

<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">If you ever decide to do something as stupid as build an automatic terrorism detector, here's a math lesson you need to learn first. It's called "the paradox of the false positive," and it's a doozy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Say you have a new disease, called Super-AIDS. Only one in a million people gets Super-AIDS. You develop a test for Super-AIDS that's 99 percent accurate. I mean, 99 percent of the time, it gives the correct result -- true if the subject is infected, and false if the subject is healthy. You give the test to a million people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One in a million people have Super-AIDS. One in a hundred people that you test will generate a "false positive" -- the test will say he has Super-AIDS even though he doesn't. That's what "99 percent accurate" means: one percent wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What's one percent of one million?</p>
<p class="calibre1">1,000,000/100 = 10,000</p>
<p class="calibre1">One in a million people has Super-AIDS. If you test a million random people, you'll probably only find one case of real Super-AIDS. But your test won't identify <i class="calibre6">one</i> person as having Super-AIDS. It will identify <i class="calibre6">10,000</i> people as having it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Your 99 percent accurate test will perform with 99.99 percent <i class="calibre6">inaccuracy</i>.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That's the paradox of the false positive. When you try to find something really rare, your test's accuracy has to match the rarity of the thing you're looking for. If you're trying to point at a single pixel on your screen, a sharp pencil is a good pointer: the pencil-tip is a lot smaller (more accurate) than the pixels. But a pencil-tip is no good at pointing at a single <i class="calibre6">atom</i> in your screen. For that, you need a pointer -- a test -- that's one atom wide or less at the tip.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the paradox of the false positive, and here's how it applies to terrorism:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Terrorists are really rare. In a city of twenty million like New York, there might be one or two terrorists. Maybe ten of them at the outside. 10/20,000,000 = 0.00005 percent. One twenty-thousandth of a percent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That's pretty rare all right. Now, say you've got some software that can sift through all the bank-records, or toll-pass records, or public transit records, or phone-call records in the city and catch terrorists 99 percent of the time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In a pool of twenty million people, a 99 percent accurate test will identify two hundred thousand people as being terrorists. But only ten of them are terrorists. To catch ten bad guys, you have to haul in and investigate two hundred thousand innocent people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Guess what? Terrorism tests aren't anywhere <i class="calibre6">close</i> to 99 percent accurate. More like 60 percent accurate. Even 40 percent accurate, sometimes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What this all meant was that the Department of Homeland Security had set itself up to fail badly. They were trying to spot incredibly rare events -- a person is a terrorist -- with inaccurate systems.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Is it any wonder we were able to make such a mess?</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">I stepped out the front door whistling on a Tuesday morning one week into the Operation False Positive. I was rockin' out to some new music I'd downloaded from the Xnet the night before -- lots of people sent M1k3y little digital gifts to say thank you for giving them hope.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I turned onto 23d Street and carefully took the narrow stone steps cut into the side of the hill. As I descended, I passed Mr Wiener Dog. I don't know Mr Wiener Dog's real name, but I see him nearly every day, walking his three panting wiener dogs up the staircase to the little parkette. Squeezing past them all on the stairs is pretty much impossible and I always end up tangled in a leash, knocked into someone's front garden, or perched on the bumper of one of the cars parked next to the curb.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr Wiener Dog is clearly Someone Important, because he has a fancy watch and always wears a nice suit. I had mentally assumed that he worked down in the financial district.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Today as I brushed up against him, I triggered my arphid cloner, which was already loaded in the pocket of my leather jacket. The cloner sucked down the numbers off his credit-cards and his car-keys, his passport and the hundred-dollar bills in his wallet.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even as it was doing that, it was flashing some of them with new numbers, taken from other people I'd brushed against. It was like switching the license-plates on a bunch of cars, but invisible and instantaneous. I smiled apologetically at Mr Wiener Dog and continued down the stairs. I stopped at three of the cars long enough to swap their FasTrak tags with numbers taken off of all the cars I'd gone past the day before.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You might think I was being a little aggro here, but I was cautious and conservative compared to a lot of the Xnetters. A couple girls in the Chemical Engineering program at UC Berkeley had figured out how to make a harmless substance out of kitchen products that would trip an explosive sniffer. They'd had a merry time sprinkling it on their profs' briefcases and jackets, then hiding out and watching the same profs try to get into the auditoriums and libraries on campus, only to get flying-tackled by the new security squads that had sprung up everywhere.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Other people wanted to figure out how to dust envelopes with substances that would test positive for anthrax, but everyone else thought they were out of their minds. Luckily, it didn't seem like they'd be able to figure it out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I passed by San Francisco General Hospital and nodded with satisfaction as I saw the huge lines at the front doors. They had a police checkpoint too, of course, and there were enough Xnetters working as interns and cafeteria workers and whatnot there that everyone's badges had been snarled up and swapped around. I'd read the security checks had tacked an hour onto everyone's work day, and the unions were threatening to walk out unless the hospital did something about it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A few blocks later, I saw an even longer line for the BART. Cops were walking up and down the line pointing people out and calling them aside for questioning, bag-searches and pat-downs. They kept getting sued for doing this, but it didn't seem to be slowing them down.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I got to school a little ahead of time and decided to walk down to 22nd Street to get a coffee -- and I passed a police checkpoint where they were pulling over cars for secondary inspection.</p>
<p class="calibre1">School was no less wild -- the security guards on the metal detectors were also wanding our school IDs and pulling out students with odd movements for questioning. Needless to say, we all had pretty weird movements. Needless to say, classes were starting an hour or more later.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Classes were crazy. I don't think anyone was able to concentrate. I overheard two teachers talking about how long it had taken them to get home from work the day before, and planning to sneak out early that day.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was all I could do to keep from laughing. The paradox of the false positive strikes again!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sure enough, they let us out of class early and I headed home the long way, circling through the Mission to see the havoc. Long lines of cars. BART stations lined up around the blocks. People swearing at ATMs that wouldn't dispense their money because they'd had their accounts frozen for suspicious activity (that's the danger of wiring your checking account straight into your FasTrak and Fast Pass!).</p>
<p class="calibre1">I got home and made myself a sandwich and logged into the Xnet. It had been a good day. People from all over town were crowing about their successes. We'd brought the city of San Francisco to a standstill. The news-reports confirmed it -- they were calling it the DHS gone haywire, blaming it all on the fake-ass "security" that was supposed to be protecting us from terrorism. The Business section of the San Francisco Chronicle gave its whole front page to an estimate of the economic cost of the DHS security resulting from missed work hours, meetings and so on. According to the Chronicle's economist, a week of this crap would cost the city more than the Bay Bridge bombing had.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mwa-ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The best part: Dad got home that night late. Very late. Three <i class="calibre6">hours</i> late. Why? Because he'd been pulled over, searched, questioned. Then it happened <i class="calibre6">again</i>. Twice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Twice!</p>
<p class="c3">Chapter 9</p>
<p class="c5">This chapter is dedicated to Compass Books/Books Inc, the oldest independent bookstore in the western USA. They've got stores up and down California, in San Francisco, Burlingame, Mountain View and Palo Alto, but coolest of all is that they run a killer bookstore in the middle of Disneyland's Downtown Disney in Anaheim. I'm a stone Disney park freak (see my first novel, Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom if you don't believe it), and every time I've lived in California, I've bought myself an annual Disneyland pass, and on practically every visit, I drop by Compass Books in Downtown Disney. They stock a brilliant selection of unauthorized (and even critical) books about Disney, as well as a great variety of kids books and science fiction, and the cafe next door makes a mean cappuccino.</p>
<p class="c5"><a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Compass Books/Books Inc</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">He was so angry I thought he was going to pop. You know I said I'd only seen him lose his cool rarely? That night, he lost it more than he ever had.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You wouldn't believe it. This cop, he was like eighteen years old and he kept saying, 'But sir, why were you in Berkeley yesterday if your client is in Mountain View?' I kept explaining to him that I teach at Berkeley and then he'd say, 'I thought you were a consultant,' and we'd start over again. It was like some kind of sitcom where the cops have been taken over by the stupidity ray.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's worse was he kept insisting that I'd been in Berkeley today as well, and I kept saying no, I hadn't been, and he said I had been. Then he showed me my FasTrak billing and it said I'd driven the San Mateo bridge three times that day!</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's not all," he said, and drew in a breath that let me know he was really steamed. "They had information about where I'd been, places that <i class="calibre6">didn't have a toll plaza</i>. They'd been polling my pass just on the street, at random. And it was <i class="calibre6">wrong</i>! Holy crap, I mean, they're spying on us all and they're not even competent!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I'd drifted down into the kitchen as he railed there, and now I was watching him from the doorway. Mom met my eye and we both raised our eyebrows as if to say, <i class="calibre6">Who's going to say 'I told you so' to him?</i> I nodded at her. She could use her spousular powers to nullify his rage in a way that was out of my reach as a mere filial unit.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Drew," she said, and grabbed him by the arm to make him stop stalking back and forth in the kitchen, waving his arms like a street-preacher.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What?" he snapped.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I think you owe Marcus an apology." She kept her voice even and level. Dad and I are the spazzes in the household -- Mom's a total rock.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad looked at me. His eyes narrowed as he thought for a minute. "All right," he said at last. "You're right. I was talking about competent surveillance. These guys were total amateurs. I'm sorry, son," he said. "You were right. That was ridiculous." He stuck his hand out and shook my hand, then gave me a firm, unexpected hug.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"God, what are we doing to this country, Marcus? Your generation deserves to inherit something better than this." When he let me go, I could see the deep wrinkles in his face, lines I'd never noticed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I went back up to my room and played some Xnet games. There was a good multiplayer thing, a clockwork pirate game where you had to quest every day or two to wind up your whole crew's mainsprings before you could go plundering and pillaging again. It was the kind of game I hated but couldn't stop playing: lots of repetitive quests that weren't all that satisfying to complete, a little bit of player-versus-player combat (scrapping to see who would captain the ship) and not that many cool puzzles that you had to figure out. Mostly, playing this kind of game made me homesick for Harajuku Fun Madness, which balanced out running around in the real world, figuring out online puzzles, and strategizing with your team.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But today it was just what I needed. Mindless entertainment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">My poor dad.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I'd done that to him. He'd been happy before, confident that his tax dollars were being spent to keep him safe. I'd destroyed that confidence. It was false confidence, of course, but it had kept him going. Seeing him now, miserable and broken, I wondered if it was better to be clear-eyed and hopeless or to live in a fool's paradise. That shame -- the shame I'd felt since I gave up my passwords, since they'd broken me -- returned, leaving me listless and wanting to just get away from myself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">My character was a swabbie on the pirate ship <i class="calibre6">Zombie Charger</i>, and he'd wound down while I'd been offline. I had to IM all the other players on my ship until I found one willing to wind me up. That kept me occupied. I liked it, actually. There was something magic about a total stranger doing you a favor. And since it was the Xnet, I knew that all the strangers were friends, in some sense.</p>
<p class="western11">&gt; Where u located?</p>
<p class="western12"/>
<p class="calibre1">The character who wound me up was called Lizanator, and it was female, though that didn't mean that it was a girl. Guys had some weird affinity for playing female characters.</p>
<p class="western11">&gt; San Francisco</p>
<p class="western12"/>
<p class="calibre1">I said.</p>
<p class="western11">&gt; No stupe, where you located in San Fran?</p>
<p class="western12"/>
<p class="western11">&gt; Why, you a pervert?</p>
<p class="western12"/>
<p class="calibre1">That usually shut down that line of conversation. Of course every gamespace was full of pedos and pervs, and cops pretending to be pedo- and perv-bait (though I sure hoped there weren't any cops on the Xnet!). An accusation like that was enough to change the subject nine out of ten times.</p>
<p class="western11">&gt; Mission? Potrero Hill? Noe? East Bay?</p>
<p class="western12"/>
<p class="western11">&gt; Just wind me up k thx?</p>
<p class="western12"/>
<p class="calibre1">She stopped winding.</p>
<p class="western11">&gt; You scared?</p>
<p class="western12"/>
<p class="western11">&gt; Safe -- why do you care?</p>
<p class="western12"/>
<p class="western11">&gt; Just curious</p>
<p class="western12"/>
<p class="calibre1">I was getting a bad vibe off her. She was clearly more than just curious. Call it paranoia. I logged off and shut down my Xbox.</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">Dad looked at me over the table the next morning and said, "It looks like it's going to get better, at least." He handed me a copy of the <i class="calibre6">Chronicle</i> open to the third page.</p>
<p class="western11">&gt; A Department of Homeland Security spokesman has confirmed that the San Francisco office has requested a 300 percent budget and personnel increase from DC</p>
<p class="western12"/>
<p class="calibre1">What?</p>
<p class="western11">&gt; Major General Graeme Sutherland, the commanding officer for Northern California DHS operations, confirmed the request at a press conference yesterday, noting that a spike in suspicious activity in the Bay Area prompted the request. "We are tracking a spike in underground chatter and activity and believe that saboteurs are deliberately manufacturing false security alerts to undermine our efforts."</p>
<p class="western12"/>
<p class="calibre1">My eyes crossed. No freaking way.</p>
<p class="western11">&gt; "These false alarms are potentially 'radar chaff' intended to disguise real attacks. The only effective way of combatting them is to step up staffing and analyst levels so that we can fully investigate every lead."</p>
<p class="western12"/>
<p class="western11">&gt; Sutherland noted the delays experienced all over the city were "unfortunate" and committed to eliminating them.</p>
<p class="western12"/>
<p class="calibre1">I had a vision of the city with four or five times as many DHS enforcers, brought in to make up for my own stupid ideas. Van was right. The more I fought them, the worse it was going to get.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad pointed at the paper. "These guys may be fools, but they're methodical fools. They'll just keep throwing resources at this problem until they solve it. It's tractable, you know. Mining all the data in the city, following up on every lead. They'll catch the terrorists."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I lost it. "Dad! Are you <i class="calibre6">listening to yourself</i>? They're talking about investigating practically every person in the city of San Francisco!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah," he said, "that's right. They'll catch every alimony cheat, every dope dealer, every dirt-bag and every terrorist. You just wait. This could be the best thing that ever happened to this country."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tell me you're joking," I said. "I beg you. You think that that's what they intended when they wrote the Constitution? What about the Bill of Rights?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The Bill of Rights was written before data-mining," he said. He was awesomely serene, convinced of his rightness. "The right to freedom of association is fine, but why shouldn't the cops be allowed to mine your social network to figure out if you're hanging out with gangbangers and terrorists?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Because it's an invasion of my privacy!" I said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's the big deal? Would you rather have privacy or terrorists?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Agh. I hated arguing with my dad like this. I needed a coffee. "Dad, come on. Taking away our privacy isn't catching terrorists: it's just inconveniencing normal people."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"How do you know it's not catching terrorists?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where are the terrorists they've caught?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sure we'll see arrests in good time. You just wait."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Dad, what the hell has happened to you since last night? You were ready to go nuclear on the cops for pulling you over --"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't use that tone with me, Marcus. What's happened since last night is that I've had the chance to think it over and to read <i class="calibre6">this</i>." He rattled his paper. "The reason they caught me is that the bad guys are actively jamming them. They need to adjust their techniques to overcome the jamming. But they'll get there. Meanwhile the occasional road stop is a small price to pay. This isn't the time to be playing lawyer about the Bill of Rights. This is the time to make some sacrifices to keep our city safe."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I couldn't finish my toast. I put the plate in the dishwasher and left for school. I had to get out of there.</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">The Xnetters weren't happy about the stepped up police surveillance, but they weren't going to take it lying down. Someone called a phone-in show on KQED and told them that the police were wasting their time, that we could monkeywrench the system faster than they could untangle it. The recording was a top Xnet download that night.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is California Live and we're talking to an anonymous caller at a payphone in San Francisco. He has his own information about the slowdowns we've been facing around town this week. Caller, you're on the air."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah, yo, this is just the beginning, you know? I mean, like, we're just getting started. Let them hire a billion pigs and put a checkpoint on every corner. We'll jam them all! And like, all this crap about terrorists? We're not terrorists! Give me a break, I mean, really! We're jamming up the system because we hate the Homeland Security, and because we love our city. Terrorists? I can't even spell jihad. Peace out."</p>
<p class="calibre1">He sounded like an idiot. Not just the incoherent words, but also his gloating tone. He sounded like a kid who was indecently proud of himself. He <i class="calibre6">was</i> a kid who was indecently proud of himself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Xnet flamed out over this. Lots of people thought he was an idiot for calling in, while others thought he was a hero. I worried that there was probably a camera aimed at the payphone he'd used. Or an arphid reader that might have sniffed his Fast Pass. I hoped he'd had the smarts to wipe his fingerprints off the quarter, keep his hood up, and leave all his arphids at home. But I doubted it. I wondered if he'd get a knock on the door sometime soon.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The way I knew when something big had happened on Xnet was that I'd suddenly get a million emails from people who wanted M1k3y to know about the latest haps. It was just as I was reading about Mr Can't-Spell-Jihad that my mailbox went crazy. Everyone had a message for me -- a link to a livejournal on the Xnet -- one of the many anonymous blogs that were based on the Freenet document publishing system that was also used by Chinese democracy advocates.</p>
<p class="western13">&gt; Close call</p>
<p class="western14"/>
<p class="western13">&gt; We were jamming at the Embarcadero tonite and goofing around giving everyone a new car key or door key or Fast Pass or FasTrak, tossing around a little fake gunpowder. There were cops everywhere but we were smarter than them; we're there pretty much every night and we never get caught.</p>
<p class="western14"/>
<p class="western13">&gt; So we got caught tonight. It was a stupid mistake we got sloppy we got busted. It was an undercover who caught my pal and then got the rest of us. They'd been watching the crowd for a long time and they had one of those trucks nearby and they took four of us in but missed the rest.</p>
<p class="western14"/>
<p class="western13">&gt; The truck was JAMMED like a can of sardines with every kind of person, old young black white rich poor all suspects, and there were two cops trying to ask us questions and the undercovers kept bringing in more of us. Most people were trying to get to the front of the line to get through questioning so we kept on moving back and it was like hours in there and really hot and it was getting more crowded not less.</p>
<p class="western14"/>
<p class="western13">&gt; At like 8PM they changed shifts and two new cops came in and bawled out the two cops who were there all like wtf? aren't you doing anything here. They had a real fight and then the two old cops left and the new cops sat down at their desks and whispered to each other for a while.</p>
<p class="western14"/>
<p class="western13">&gt; Then one cop stood up and started shouting EVERYONE JUST GO HOME JESUS CHRIST WE'VE GOT BETTER THINGS TO DO THAN BOTHER YOU WITH MORE QUESTIONS IF YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING WRONG JUST DON'T DO IT AGAIN AND LET THIS BE A WARNING TO YOU ALL.</p>
<p class="western14"/>
<p class="western13">&gt; A bunch of the suits got really pissed which was HILARIOUS because I mean ten minutes before they were buggin about being held there and now they were wicked pissed about being let go, like make up your minds!</p>
<p class="western14"/>
<p class="western13">&gt; We split fast though and got out and came home to write this. There are undercovers everywhere, believe. If you're jamming, be open-eyed and get ready to run when problems happen. If you get caught try to wait it out they're so busy they'll maybe just let you go.</p>

<p class="western13">&gt; We made them that busy! All those people in that truck were there because we'd jammed them. So jam on!</p>
<p class="calibre1">I felt like I was going to throw up. Those four people -- kids I'd never met -- they nearly went away forever because of something I'd started.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because of something I'd told them to do. I was no better than a terrorist.</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">The DHS got their budget requisition approved. The President went on TV with the Governor to tell us that no price was too high for security. We had to watch it the next day in school at assembly. My Dad cheered. He'd hated the President since the day he was elected, saying he wasn't any better than the last guy and the last guy had been a complete disaster, but now all he could do was talk about how decisive and dynamic the new guy was.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You have to take it easy on your father," Mom said to me one night after I got home from school. She'd been working from home as much as possible. Mom's a freelance relocation specialist who helps British people get settled in in San Francisco. The UK High Commission pays her to answer emails from mystified British people across the country who are totally confused by how freaky we Americans are. She explains Americans for a living, and she said that these days it was better to do that from home, where she didn't have to actually see any Americans or talk to them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I don't have any illusions about Britain. America may be willing to trash its Constitution every time some Jihadist looks cross-eyed at us, but as I learned in my ninth-grade Social Studies independent project, the Brits don't even <i class="calibre6">have</i> a Constitution. They've got laws there that would curl the hair on your toes: they can put you in jail for an entire year if they're really sure that you're a terrorist but don't have enough evidence to prove it. Now, how sure can they be if they don't have enough evidence to prove it? How'd they get that sure? Did they see you committing terrorist acts in a really vivid dream?</p>
<p class="calibre1">And the surveillance in Britain makes America look like amateur hour. The average Londoner is photographed 500 times a day, just walking around the streets. Every license plate is photographed at every corner in the country. Everyone from the banks to the public transit company is enthusiastic about tracking you and snitching on you if they think you're remotely suspicious.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But Mom didn't see it that way. She'd left Britain halfway through high school and she'd never felt at home here, no matter that she'd married a boy from Petaluma and raised a son here. To her, this was always the land of barbarians, and Britain would always be home.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mom, he's just wrong. You of all people should know that. Everything that makes this country great is being flushed down the toilet and he's going along with it. Have you noticed that they haven't <i class="calibre6">caught any terrorists</i>? Dad's all like, 'We need to be safe,' but he needs to know that most of us don't feel safe. We feel endangered all the time."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I know this all, Marcus. Believe me, I'm not fan of what's been happening to this country. But your father is --" She broke off. "When you didn't come home after the attacks, he thought --"</p>
<p class="calibre1">She got up and made herself a cup of tea, something she did whenever she was uncomfortable or disconcerted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Marcus," she said. "Marcus, we thought you were dead. Do you understand that? We were mourning you for days. We were imagining you blown to bits, at the bottom of the ocean. Dead because some bastard decided to kill hundreds of strangers to make some point."</p>
<p class="calibre1">That sank in slowly. I mean, I understood that they'd been worried. Lots of people died in the bombings -- four thousand was the present estimate -- and practically everyone knew someone who didn't come home that day. There were two people from my school who had disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your father was ready to kill someone. Anyone. He was out of his mind. You've never seen him like this. I've never seen him like it either. He was out of his mind. He'd just sit at this table and curse and curse and curse. Vile words, words I'd never heard him say. One day -- the third day -- someone called and he was sure it was you, but it was a wrong number and he threw the phone so hard it disintegrated into thousands of pieces." I'd wondered about the new kitchen phone.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Something broke in your father. He loves you. We both love you. You are the most important thing in our lives. I don't think you realize that. Do you remember when you were ten, when I went home to London for all that time? Do you remember?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I nodded silently.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"We were ready to get a divorce, Marcus. Oh, it doesn't matter why anymore. It was just a bad patch, the kind of thing that happens when people who love each other stop paying attention for a few years. He came and got me and convinced me to come back for you. We couldn't bear the thought of doing that to you. We fell in love again for you. We're together today because of you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I had a lump in my throat. I'd never known this. No one had ever told me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So your father is having a hard time right now. He's not in his right mind. It's going to take some time before he comes back to us, before he's the man I love again. We need to understand him until then."</p>
<p class="calibre1">She gave me a long hug, and I noticed how thin her arms had gotten, how saggy the skin on her neck was. I always thought of my mother as young, pale, rosy-cheeked and cheerful, peering shrewdly through her metal-rim glasses. Now she looked a little like an old woman. I had done that to her. The terrorists had done that to her. The Department of Homeland Security had done that to her. In a weird way, we were all on the same side, and Mom and Dad and all those people we'd spoofed were on the other side.</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">I couldn't sleep that night. Mom's words kept running through my head. Dad had been tense and quiet at dinner and we'd barely spoken, because I didn't trust myself not to say the wrong thing and because he was all wound up over the latest news, that Al Qaeda was definitely responsible for the bombing. Six different terrorist groups had claimed responsibility for the attack, but only Al Qaeda's Internet video disclosed information that the DHS said they hadn't disclosed to anyone.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I lay in bed and listened to a late-night call-in radio show. The topic was sex problems, with this gay guy who I normally loved to listen to, he would give people such raw advice, but good advice, and he was really funny and campy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tonight I couldn't laugh. Most of the callers wanted to ask what to do about the fact that they were having a hard time getting busy with their partners ever since the attack. Even on sex-talk radio, I couldn't get away from the topic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I switched the radio off and heard a purring engine on the street below.</p>
<p class="calibre1">My bedroom is in the top floor of our house, one of the painted ladies. I have a sloping attic ceiling and windows on both sides -- one overlooks the whole Mission, the other looks out into the street in front of our place. There were often cars cruising at all hours of the night, but there was something different about this engine noise.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I went to the street-window and pulled up my blinds. Down on the street below me was a white, unmarked van whose roof was festooned with radio antennas, more antennas than I'd ever seen on a car. It was cruising very slowly down the street, a little dish on top spinning around and around.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As I watched, the van stopped and one of the back doors popped open. A guy in a DHS uniform -- I could spot one from a hundred yards now -- stepped out into the street. He had some kind of handheld device, and its blue glow lit his face. He paced back and forth, first scouting my neighbors, making notes on his device, then heading for me. There was something familiar in the way he walked, looking down --</p>
<p class="calibre1">He was using a wifinder! The DHS was scouting for Xnet nodes. I let go of the blinds and dove across my room for my Xbox. I'd left it up while I downloaded some cool animations one of the Xnetters had made of the President's no-price-too-high speech. I yanked the plug out of the wall, then scurried back to the window and cracked the blind a fraction of an inch.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The guy was looking down into his wifinder again, walking back and forth in front of our house. A moment later, he got back into his van and drove away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I got out my camera and took as many pictures as I could of the van and its antennas. Then I opened them in a free image-editor called The GIMP and edited out everything from the photo except the van, erasing my street and anything that might identify me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I posted them to Xnet and wrote down everything I could about the vans. These guys were definitely looking for the Xnet, I could tell.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now I really couldn't sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing for it but to play wind-up pirates. There'd be lots of players even at this hour. The real name for wind-up pirates was Clockwork Plunder, and it was a hobbyist project that had been created by teenaged death-metal freaks from Finland. It was totally free to play, and offered just as much fun as any of the $15/month services like Ender's Universe and Middle Earth Quest and Discworld Dungeons.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I logged back in and there I was, still on the deck of the Zombie Charger, waiting for someone to wind me up. I hated this part of the game.</p>
<p class="western15">&gt; Hey you</p>
<p class="western16"/>
<p class="calibre1">I typed to a passing pirate.</p>
<p class="western15">&gt; Wind me up?</p>
<p class="western16"/>
<p class="calibre1">He paused and looked at me.</p>
<p class="western15">&gt; y should i?</p>
<p class="western16"/>
<p class="western15">&gt; We're on the same team. Plus you get experience points.</p>
<p class="western16"/>
<p class="calibre1">What a jerk.</p>
<p class="western15">&gt; Where are you located?</p>
<p class="western16"/>
<p class="western15">&gt; San Francisco</p>
<p class="western16"/>
<p class="calibre1">This was starting to feel familiar.</p>
<p class="western15">&gt; Where in San Francisco?</p>
<p class="western16"/>
<p class="calibre1">I logged out. There was something weird going on in the game. I jumped onto the livejournals and began to crawl from blog to blog. I got through half a dozen before I found something that froze my blood.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Livejournallers love quizzes. What kind of hobbit are you? Are you a great lover? What planet are you most like? Which character from some movie are you? What's your emotional type? They fill them in and their friends fill them in and everyone compares their results. Harmless fun.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But the quiz that had taken over the blogs of the Xnet that night was what scared me, because it was anything but harmless:</p>
<ul class="calibre4">
<li class="calibre5">
<p class="calibre1">What's your sex</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="calibre4">
<li class="calibre5">
<p class="calibre1">What grade are you in?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="calibre4">
<li class="calibre5">
<p class="calibre1">What school do you go to?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="calibre4">
<li class="calibre5">
<p class="calibre1">Where in the city do you live?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre1">The quizzes plotted the results on a map with colored pushpins for schools and neighborhoods, and made lame recommendations for places to buy pizza and stuff.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But look at those questions. Think about my answers:</p>
<ul class="calibre4">
<li class="calibre5">
<p class="calibre1">Male</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="calibre4">
<li class="calibre5">
<p class="calibre1">12</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="calibre4">
<li class="calibre5">
<p class="calibre1">Chavez High</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="calibre4">
<li class="calibre5">
<p class="calibre1">Potrero Hill</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre1">There were only two people in my whole school who matched that profile. Most schools it would be the same. If you wanted to figure out who the Xnetters were, you could use these quizzes to find them all.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That was bad enough, but what was worse was what it implied: someone from the DHS was using the Xnet to get at us. The Xnet was compromised by the DHS.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We had spies in our midst.</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">I'd given Xnet discs to hundreds of people, and they'd done the same. I knew the people I gave the discs to pretty well. Some of them I knew very well. I've lived in the same house all my life and I've made hundreds and hundreds of friends over the years, from people who went to daycare with me to people I played soccer with, people who LARPed with me, people I met clubbing, people I knew from school. My ARG team were my closest friends, but there were plenty of people I knew and trusted enough to hand an Xnet disc to.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I needed them now.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I woke Jolu up by ringing his cell phone and hanging up after the first ring, three times in a row. A minute later, he was up on Xnet and we were able to have a secure chat. I pointed him to my blog-post on the radio vans and he came back a minute later all freaked out.</p>
<p class="western17">&gt; You sure they're looking for us?</p>
<p class="western18"/>
<p class="calibre1">In response I sent him to the quiz.</p>
<p class="western17">&gt; OMG we're doomed</p>
<p class="western18"/>
<p class="western17">&gt; No it's not that bad but we need to figure out who we can trust</p>
<p class="western18"/>
<p class="western17">&gt; How?</p>
<p class="western18"/>
<p class="western17">&gt; That's what I wanted to ask you -- how many people can you totally vouch for like trust them to the ends of the earth?</p>
<p class="western18"/>
<p class="western17">&gt; Um 20 or 30 or so</p>
<p class="western18"/>
<p class="western17">&gt; I want to get a bunch of really trustworthy people together and do a key-exchange web of trust thing</p>
<p class="western18"/>
<p class="calibre1">Web of trust is one of those cool crypto things that I'd read about but never tried. It was a nearly foolproof way to make sure that you could talk to the people you trusted, but that no one else could listen in. The problem is that it requires you to physically meet with the people in the web at least once, just to get started.</p>
