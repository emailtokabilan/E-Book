<p class="calibre1">3. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with the exchange of copyrighted works.</p>
<p class="calibre1">4. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.</p>
<p class="calibre1">5. For the avoidance of doubt:</p>
<p class="calibre1">1. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;</p>
<p class="calibre1">2. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,</p>
<p class="calibre1">3. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).</p>
<p class="calibre1">6. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.</p>
<p class="calibre1">5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer</p>
<p class="calibre1">UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
<p class="calibre1">6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<p class="calibre1">7. Termination</p>
<p class="calibre1">1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.</p>
<p class="calibre1">2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.</p>
<p class="calibre1">8. Miscellaneous</p>
<p class="calibre1">1. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.</p>
<p class="calibre1">2. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.</p>
<p class="calibre1">3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">5. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.</p>
<p class="calibre1">6. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be renamed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks. Redistribution is subject to the trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.</p>

this work<br class="calibre2"/>(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project<br class="calibre2"/>Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project<br

class="calibre2"/>1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm<br class="calibre2"/>electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to<br class="calibre2"/>and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property<br class="calibre2"/>(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all<br class="calibre2"/>the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy<br class="calibre2"/>all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.<br class="calibre2"/>If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project<br class="calibre2"/>Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the<br class="calibre2"/>terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or<br class="calibre2"/>entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be<br class="calibre2"/>used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who<br class="calibre2"/>agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few<br class="calibre2"/>things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works<br class="calibre2"/>even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See<br class="calibre2"/>paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project<br class="calibre2"/>Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement<br class="calibre2"/>and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic<br class="calibre2"/>works.  See paragraph 1.E below.<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"<br class="calibre2"/>or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project<br class="calibre2"/>Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the<br class="calibre2"/>collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an<br class="calibre2"/>individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are<br class="calibre2"/>located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from<br class="calibre2"/>copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative<br class="calibre2"/>works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg<br class="calibre2"/>are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project<br class="calibre2"/>Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by<br class="calibre2"/>freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of<br class="calibre2"/>this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with<br class="calibre2"/>the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by<br class="calibre2"/>keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project<br class="calibre2"/>Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.<br class="calibre2"/>This particular work is one of the few copyrighted individual works<br class="calibre2"/>included with the permission of the copyright holder.  Information on<br class="calibre2"/>the copyright owner for this particular work and the terms of use<br class="calibre2"/>imposed by the copyright holder on this work are set forth at the<br class="calibre2"/>beginning of this work.<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern<br class="calibre2"/>what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in<br class="calibre2"/>a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check<br class="calibre2"/>the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement<br class="calibre2"/>before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or<br class="calibre2"/>creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project<br class="calibre2"/>Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning<br class="calibre2"/>the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United<br class="calibre2"/>States.<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate<br class="calibre2"/>access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently<br class="calibre2"/>whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the<br class="calibre2"/>phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project<br class="calibre2"/>Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,<br class="calibre2"/>copied or distributed:<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with<br class="calibre2"/>almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or<br class="calibre2"/>re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included<br class="calibre2"/>with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived<br class="calibre2"/>from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is<br class="calibre2"/>posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied<br class="calibre2"/>and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees<br class="calibre2"/>or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work<br class="calibre2"/>with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the<br class="calibre2"/>work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1<br class="calibre2"/>through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the<br class="calibre2"/>Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or<br class="calibre2"/>1.E.9.<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted<br class="calibre2"/>with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution<br class="calibre2"/>must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional<br class="calibre2"/>terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked<br class="calibre2"/>to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the<br class="calibre2"/>permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm<br class="calibre2"/>License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this<br class="calibre2"/>work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this<br class="calibre2"/>electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without<br class="calibre2"/>prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with<br class="calibre2"/>active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project<br class="calibre2"/>Gutenberg-tm License.<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,<br class="calibre2"/>compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any<br class="calibre2"/>word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or<br class="calibre2"/>distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than<br class="calibre2"/>"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version<br class="calibre2"/>posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),<br class="calibre2"/>you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a<br class="calibre2"/>copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon<br class="calibre2"/>request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other<br class="calibre2"/>form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm<br class="calibre2"/>License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,<br class="calibre2"/>performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works<br class="calibre2"/>unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing<br class="calibre2"/>access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided<br class="calibre2"/>that<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from<br class="calibre2"/>     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method<br class="calibre2"/>     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is<br class="calibre2"/>     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he<br class="calibre2"/>     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the<br class="calibre2"/>     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments<br class="calibre2"/>     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you<br class="calibre2"/>     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax<br class="calibre2"/>     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and<br class="calibre2"/>     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the<br class="calibre2"/>     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to<br class="calibre2"/>     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies<br class="calibre2"/>     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he<br class="calibre2"/>     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm<br class="calibre2"/>     License.  You must require such a user to return or<br class="calibre2"/>     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium<br class="calibre2"/>     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of<br class="calibre2"/>     Project Gutenberg-tm works.<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any<br class="calibre2"/>     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the<br class="calibre2"/>     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days<br class="calibre2"/>     of receipt of the work.<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free<br class="calibre2"/>     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm<br class="calibre2"/>electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set<br class="calibre2"/>forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from<br class="calibre2"/>both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael<br class="calibre2"/>Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the<br class="calibre2"/>Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>1.F.<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable<br class="calibre2"/>effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread<br class="calibre2"/>public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm<br class="calibre2"/>collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic<br class="calibre2"/>works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain<br class="calibre2"/>"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or<br class="calibre2"/>corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual<br class="calibre2"/>property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a<br class="calibre2"/>computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by<br class="calibre2"/>your equipment.<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right<br class="calibre2"/>of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project<br class="calibre2"/>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project<br class="calibre2"/>Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project<br class="calibre2"/>Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all<br class="calibre2"/>liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal<br class="calibre2"/>fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT<br class="calibre2"/>LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE<br class="calibre2"/>PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE<br class="calibre2"/>TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE<br class="calibre2"/>LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR<br class="calibre2"/>INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br class="calibre2"/>DAMAGE.<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a<br class="calibre2"/>defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can<br class="calibre2"/>receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a<br class="calibre2"/>written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you<br class="calibre2"/>received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with<br class="calibre2"/>your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with<br class="calibre2"/>the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a<br class="calibre2"/>refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity<br class="calibre2"/>providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to<br class="calibre2"/>receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy<br class="calibre2"/>is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further<br class="calibre2"/>opportunities to fix the problem.<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth<br class="calibre2"/>in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER<br class="calibre2"/>WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO<br class="calibre2"/>WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied<br class="calibre2"/>warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.<br class="calibre2"/>If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this

distribution of<br class="calibre2"/>electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers<br class="calibre2"/>including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists<br

financial support to provide volunteers with the<br class="calibre2"/>assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's<br class="calibre2"/>goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will<br class="calibre2"/>remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project<br class="calibre2"/>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to

Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm<br class="calibre2"/>concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared<br class="calibre2"/>with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project<br class="calibre2"/>Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed<br class="calibre2"/>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.<br class="calibre2"/>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily<br class="calibre2"/>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's<br class="calibre2"/>eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,<br class="calibre2"/>compressed (zipped), HTML and others.<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over<br class="calibre2"/>the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.<br class="calibre2"/>VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving<br class="calibre2"/>new filenames and etext numbers.<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/><a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">http://www.gutenberg.org</a><br class="calibre2"/>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,<br class="calibre2"/>including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary<br class="calibre2"/>Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to<br class="calibre2"/>subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,<br class="calibre2"/>are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to<br class="calibre2"/>download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular<br class="calibre2"/>search system you may utilize the following addresses and just<br class="calibre2"/>download by the etext year.<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/><a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a><br class="calibre2"/>    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,<br class="calibre2"/>     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are<br class="calibre2"/>filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part<br class="calibre2"/>of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is<br class="calibre2"/>identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single<br class="calibre2"/>digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For<br class="calibre2"/>example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>http://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>or filename 24689 would be found at:<br class="calibre2"/>http://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689<br class="calibre2"/><br class="calibre2"/>An alternative method of locating eBooks:<br class="calibre2"/><a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">http://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL</a><br class="calibre2"/>*** END: FULL LICENSE ***<br class="calibre2"/></div>
