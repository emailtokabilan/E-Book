<p class="calibre1">The hood didn't come off until I was in my cell. They didn't bother with the cuffs at my wrists and ankles, just rolled me off the stretcher and onto the floor. It was dark, but by the moonlight from the single, tiny, high window, I could see that the mattress had been taken off the cot. The room contained me, a toilet, a bed-frame, and a sink, and nothing else.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I closed my eyes and let the ocean lift me. I floated away. Somewhere, far below me, was my body. I could tell what would happen next. I was being left to piss myself. Again. I knew what that was like. I'd pissed myself before. It smelled bad. It itched. It was humiliating, like being a baby.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But I'd survived it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I laughed. The sound was weird, and it drew me back into my body, back to the present. I laughed and laughed. I'd had the worst that they could throw at me, and I'd survived it, and I'd <i class="calibre6">beaten them</i>, beaten them for months, showed them up as chumps and despots. I'd <i class="calibre6">won</i>.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I let my bladder cut loose. It was sore and full anyway, and no time like the present.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The ocean swept me away.</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">When morning came, two efficient, impersonal guards cut the bindings off of my wrists and ankles. I still couldn't walk -- when I stood, my legs gave way like a stringless marionette's. Too much time in one position. The guards pulled my arms over their shoulders and half-dragged/half-carried me down the familiar corridor. The bar codes on the doors were curling up and dangling now, attacked by the salt air.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I got an idea. "Ange!" I yelled. "Darryl!" I yelled. My guards yanked me along faster, clearly disturbed but not sure what to do about it. "Guys, it's me, Marcus! Stay free!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind one of the doors, someone sobbed. Someone else cried out in what sounded like Arabic. Then it was cacophony, a thousand different shouting voices.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They brought me to a new room. It was an old shower-room, with the shower-heads still present in the mould tiles.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hello, M1k3y," Severe Haircut said. "You seem to have had an eventful morning." She wrinkled her nose pointedly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I pissed myself," I said, cheerfully. "You should try it."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Maybe we should give you a bath, then," she said. She nodded, and my guards carried me to another stretcher. This one had restraining straps running its length. They dropped me onto it and it was ice-cold and soaked through. Before I knew it, they had the straps across my shoulders, hips and ankles. A minute later, three more straps were tied down. A man's hands grabbed the railings by my head and released some catches, and a moment later I was tilted down, my head below my feet.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's start with something simple," she said. I craned my head to see her. She had turned to a desk with an Xbox on it, connected to an expensive-looking flat-panel TV. "I'd like you to tell me your login and password for your Pirate Party email, please?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I closed my eyes and let the ocean carry me off the beach.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do you know what waterboarding is, M1k3y?" Her voice reeled me in. "You get strapped down like this, and we pour water over your head, up your nose and down your mouth. You can't suppress the gag reflex. They call it a simulated execution, and from what I can tell from this side of the room, that's a fair assessment. You won't be able to fight the feeling that you're dying."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I tried to go away. I'd heard of waterboarding. This was it, real torture. And this was just the beginning.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I couldn't go away. The ocean didn't sweep in and lift me. There was a tightness in my chest, my eyelids fluttered. I could feel clammy piss on my legs and clammy sweat in my hair. My skin itched from the dried puke.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She swam into view above me. "Let's start with the login," she said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I closed my eyes, squeezed them shut.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Give him a drink," she said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I heard people moving. I took a deep breath and held it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The water started as a trickle, a ladleful of water gently poured over my chin, my lips. Up my upturned nostrils. It went back into my throat, starting to choke me, but I wouldn't cough, wouldn't gasp and suck it into my lungs. I held onto my breath and squeezed my eyes harder.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a commotion from outside the room, a sound of chaotic boots stamping, angry, outraged shouts. The dipper was emptied into my face.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I heard her mutter something to someone in the room, then to me she said, "Just the login, Marcus. It's a simple request. What could I do with your login, anyway?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">This time, it was a bucket of water, all at once, a flood that didn't stop, it must have been gigantic. I couldn't help it. I gasped and aspirated the water into my lungs, coughed and took more water in. I knew they wouldn't kill me, but I couldn't convince my body of that. In every fiber of my being, I knew I was going to die. I couldn't even cry -- the water was still pouring over me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then it stopped. I coughed and coughed and coughed, but at the angle I was at, the water I coughed up dribbled back into my nose and burned down my sinuses.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The coughs were so deep they hurt, hurt my ribs and my hips as I twisted against them. I hated how my body was betraying me, how my mind couldn't control my body, but there was nothing for it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, the coughing subsided enough for me to take in what was going on around me. People were shouting and it sounded like someone was scuffling, wrestling. I opened my eyes and blinked into the bright light, then craned my neck, still coughing a little.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The room had a lot more people in it than it had had when we started. Most of them seemed to be wearing body armor, helmets, and smoked-plastic visors. They were shouting at the Treasure Island guards, who were shouting back, necks corded with veins.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Stand down!" one of the body-armors said. "Stand down and put your hands in the air. You are under arrest!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Severe haircut woman was talking on her phone. One of the body armors noticed her and he moved swiftly to her and batted her phone away with a gloved hand. Everyone fell silent as it sailed through the air in an arc that spanned the small room, clattering to the ground in a shower of parts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The silence broke and the body-armors moved into the room. Two grabbed each of my torturers. I almost managed a smile at the look on Severe Haircut's face when two men grabbed her by the shoulders, turned her around, and yanked a set of plastic handcuffs around her wrists.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the body-armors moved forward from the doorway. He had a video camera on his shoulder, a serious rig with blinding white light. He got the whole room, circling me twice while he got me. I found myself staying perfectly still, as though I was sitting for a portrait.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was ridiculous.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do you think you could get me off of this thing?" I managed to get it all out with only a little choking.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Two more body armors moved up to me, one a woman, and began to unstrap me. They flipped their visors up and smiled at me. They had red crosses on their shoulders and helmets.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Beneath the red crosses was another insignia: CHP. California Highway Patrol. They were State Troopers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I started to ask what they were doing there, and that's when I saw Barbara Stratford. She'd evidently been held back in the corridor, but now she came in pushing and shoving. "There you are," she said, kneeling beside me and grabbing me in the longest, hardest hug of my life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That's when I knew it -- Guantanamo by the Bay was in the hands of its enemies. I was saved.</p>
<p class="c3">Chapter 21</p>
<p class="c5">This chapter is dedicated to Pages Books in Toronto, Canada. Long a fixture on the bleedingly trendy Queen Street West strip, Pages is located over the road from CityTV and just a few doors down from the old Bakka store where I worked. We at Bakka loved having Pages down the street from us: what we were to science fiction, they were to everything else: hand-picked material representing the stuff you'd never find elsewhere, the stuff you didn't know you were looking for until you saw it there. Pages also has one of the best news-stands I've ever seen, row on row of incredible magazines and zines from all over the world.</p>
<p class="c5"><a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Pages Books</a>: 256 Queen St W, Toronto, ON M5V 1Z8 Canada +1 416 598 1447</p>
<p class="calibre1">They left me and Barbara alone in the room then, and I used the working shower head to rinse off -- I was suddenly embarrassed to be covered in piss and barf. When I finished, Barbara was in tears.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your parents --" she began.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I felt like I might throw up again. God, my poor folks. What they must have gone through.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are they here?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No," she said. "It's complicated," she said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're still under arrest, Marcus. Everyone here is. They can't just sweep in and throw open the doors. Everyone here is going to have to be processed through the criminal justice system. It could take, well, it could take months."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm going to have to stay here for <i class="calibre6">months</i>?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">She grabbed my hands. "No, I think we're going to be able to get you arraigned and released on bail pretty fast. But pretty fast is a relative term. I wouldn't expect anything to happen today. And it's not going to be like those people had it. It will be humane. There will be real food. No interrogations. Visits from your family.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just because the DHS is out, it doesn't mean that you get to just walk out of here. What's happened here is that we're getting rid of the bizarro-world version of the justice system they'd instituted and replacing it with the old system. The system with judges, open trials and lawyers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So we can try to get you transferred to a juvie facility on the mainland, but Marcus, those places can be really rough. Really, really rough. This might be the best place for you until we get you bailed out."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bailed out. Of course. I was a criminal -- I hadn't been charged yet, but there were bound to be plenty of charges they could think of. It was practically illegal just to think impure thoughts about the government.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She gave my hands another squeeze. "It sucks, but this is how it has to be. The point is, it's <i class="calibre6">over</i>. The Governor has thrown the DHS out of the State, dismantled every checkpoint. The Attorney General has issued warrants for any law-enforcement officers involved in 'stress interrogations' and secret imprisonments. They'll go to jail, Marcus, and it's because of what you did."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was numb. I heard the words, but they hardly made sense. Somehow, it was over, but it wasn't over.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Look," she said. "We probably have an hour or two before this all settles down, before they come back and put you away again. What do you want to do? Walk on the beach? Get a meal? These people had an incredible staff room -- we raided it on the way in. Gourmet all the way."</p>
<p class="calibre1">At last a question I could answer. "I want to find Ange. I want to find Darryl."</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">I tried to use a computer I found to look up their cell-numbers, but it wanted a password, so we were reduced to walking the corridors, calling out their names. Behind the cell-doors, prisoners screamed back at us, or cried, or begged us to let them go. They didn't understand what had just happened, couldn't see their former guards being herded onto the docks in plastic handcuffs, taken away by California state SWAT teams.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ange!" I called over the din, "Ange Carvelli! Darryl Glover! It's Marcus!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">We'd walked the whole length of the cell-block and they hadn't answered. I felt like crying. They'd been shipped overseas -- they were in Syria or worse. I'd never see them again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I sat down and leaned against the corridor wall and put my face in my hands. I saw Severe Haircut Woman's face, saw her smirk as she asked me for my login. She had done this. She would go to jail for it, but that wasn't enough. I thought that when I saw her again, I might kill her. She deserved it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come on," Barbara said, "Come on, Marcus. Don't give up. There's more around here, come on."</p>
<p class="calibre1">She was right. All the doors we'd passed in the cellblock were old, rusting things that dated back to when the base was first built. But at the very end of the corridor, sagging open, was a new high-security door as thick as a dictionary. We pulled it open and ventured into the dark corridor within.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There were four more cell-doors here, doors without bar codes. Each had a small electronic keypad mounted on it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Darryl?" I said. "Ange?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Marcus?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Ange, calling out from behind the furthest door. Ange, my Ange, my angel.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ange!" I cried. "It's me, it's me!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh God, Marcus," she choked out, and then it was all sobs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I pounded on the other doors. "Darryl! Darryl, are you here?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm here." The voice was very small, and very hoarse. "I'm here. I'm very, very sorry. Please. I'm very sorry."</p>
<p class="calibre1">He sounded... broken. Shattered.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's me, D," I said, leaning on his door. "It's Marcus. It's over -- they arrested the guards. They kicked the Department of Homeland Security out. We're getting trials, open trials. And we get to testify against <i class="calibre6">them</i>."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry," he said. "Please, I'm so sorry."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The California patrolmen came to the door then. They still had their camera rolling. "Ms Stratford?" one said. He had his faceplate up and he looked like any other cop, not like my savior. Like someone come to lock me up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Captain Sanchez," she said. "We've located two of the prisoners of interest here. I'd like to see them released and inspect them for myself."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ma'am, we don't have access codes for those doors yet," he said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She held up her hand. "That wasn't the arrangement. I was to have complete access to this facility. That came direct from the Governor, sir. We aren't budging until you open these cells." Her face was perfectly smooth, without a single hint of give or flex. She meant it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Captain looked like he needed sleep. He grimaced. "I'll see what I can do," he said.</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">They did manage to open the cells, finally, about half an hour later. It took three tries, but they eventually got the right codes entered, matching them to the arphids on the ID badges they'd taken off the guards they'd arrested.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They got into Ange's cell first. She was dressed in a hospital gown, open at the back, and her cell was even more bare than mine had been -- just padding all over, no sink or bed, no light. She emerged blinking into the corridor and the police camera was on her, its bright lights in her face. Barbara stepped protectively between us and it. Ange stepped tentatively out of her cell, shuffling a little. There was something wrong with her eyes, with her face. She was crying, but that wasn't it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"They drugged me," she said. "When I wouldn't stop screaming for a lawyer."</p>
<p class="calibre1">That's when I hugged her. She sagged against me, but she squeezed back, too. She smelled stale and sweaty, and I smelled no better. I never wanted to let go.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That's when they opened Darryl's cell.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He had shredded his paper hospital gown. He was curled up, naked, in the back of the cell, shielding himself from the camera and our stares. I ran to him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"D," I whispered in his ear. "D, it's me. It's Marcus. It's over. The guards have been arrested. We're going to get bail, we're going home."</p>
<p class="calibre1">He trembled and squeezed his eyes shut. "I'm sorry," he whispered, and turned his face away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They took me away then, a cop in body-armor and Barbara, took me back to my cell and locked the door, and that's where I spent the night.</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">I don't remember much about the trip to the courthouse. They had me chained to five other prisoners, all of whom had been in for a lot longer than me. One only spoke Arabic -- he was an old man, and he trembled. The others were all young. I was the only white one. Once we had been gathered on the deck of the ferry, I saw that nearly everyone on Treasure Island had been one shade of brown or another.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I had only been inside for one night, but it was too long. There was a light drizzle coming down, normally the sort of thing that would make me hunch my shoulders and look down, but today I joined everyone else in craning my head back at the infinite gray sky, reveling in the stinging wet as we raced across the bay to the ferry-docks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They took us away in buses. The shackles made climbing into the buses awkward, and it took a long time for everyone to load. No one cared. When we weren't struggling to solve the geometry problem of six people, one chain, narrow bus-aisle, we were just looking around at the city around us, up the hill at the buildings.</p>
<p class="calibre1">All I could think of was finding Darryl and Ange, but neither were in evidence. It was a big crowd and we weren't allowed to move freely through it. The state troopers who handled us were gentle enough, but they were still big, armored and armed. I kept thinking I saw Darryl in the crowd, but it was always someone else with that same beaten, hunched look that he'd had in his cell. He wasn't the only broken one.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the courthouse, they marched us into interview rooms in our shackle group. An ACLU lawyer took our information and asked us a few questions -- when she got to me, she smiled and greeted me by name -- and then led us into the courtroom before the judge. He wore an actual robe, and seemed to be in a good mood.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The deal seemed to be that anyone who had a family member to post bail could go free, and everyone else got sent to prison. The ACLU lawyer did a lot of talking to the judge, asking for a few more hours while the prisoners' families were rounded up and brought to the court-house. The judge was pretty good about it, but when I realized that some of these people had been locked up since the bridge blew, taken for dead by their families, without trial, subjected to interrogation, isolation, torture -- I wanted to just break the chains myself and set everyone free.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When I was brought before the judge, he looked down at me and took off his glasses. He looked tired. The ACLU lawyer looked tired. The bailiffs looked tired. Behind me, I could hear a sudden buzz of conversation as my name was called by the bailiff. The judge rapped his gavel once, without looking away from me. He scrubbed at his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mr Yallow," he said, "the prosecution has identified you as a flight risk. I think they have a point. You certainly have more, shall we say, <i class="calibre6">history</i>, than the other people here. I am tempted to hold you over for trial, no matter how much bail your parents are prepared to post."</p>
<p class="calibre1">My lawyer started to say something, but the judge silenced her with a look. He scrubbed at his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do you have anything to say?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I had the chance to run," I said. "Last week. Someone offered to take me away, get me out of town, help me build a new identity. Instead I stole her phone, escaped from our truck, and ran away. I turned over her phone -- which had evidence about my friend, Darryl Glover, on it -- to a journalist and hid out here, in town."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You stole a phone?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I decided that I couldn't run. That I had to face justice -- that my freedom wasn't worth anything if I was a wanted man, or if the city was still under the DHS. If my friends were still locked up. That freedom for me wasn't as important as a free country."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But you did steal a phone."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I nodded. "I did. I plan on giving it back, if I ever find the young woman in question."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, thank you for that speech, Mr Yallow. You are a very well spoken young man." He glared at the prosecutor. "Some would say a very brave man, too. There was a certain video on the news this morning. It suggested that you had some legitimate reason to evade the authorities. In light of that, and of your little speech here, I will grant bail, but I will also ask the prosecutor to add a charge of Misdemeanor Petty Theft to the count, as regards the matter of the phone. For this, I expect another $50,000 in bail."</p>
<p class="calibre1">He banged his gavel again, and my lawyer gave my hand a squeeze.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked down at me again and re-seated his glasses. He had dandruff, there on the shoulders of his robe. A little more rained down as his glasses touched his wiry, curly hair.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You can go now, young man. Stay out of trouble."</p>
<p class="western7">#</p>
<p class="western7"/>
<p class="calibre1">I turned to go and someone tackled me. It was Dad. He literally lifted me off my feet, hugging me so hard my ribs creaked. He hugged me the way I remembered him hugging me when I was a little boy, when he'd spin me around and around in hilarious, vomitous games of airplane that ended with him tossing me in the air and catching me and squeezing me like that, so hard it almost hurt.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A set of softer hands pried me gently out of his arms. Mom. She held me at arm's length for a moment, searching my face for something, not saying anything, tears streaming down her face. She smiled and it turned into a sob and then she was holding me too, and Dad's arm encircled us both.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When they let go, I managed to finally say something. "Darryl?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"His father met me somewhere else. He's in the hospital."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"When can I see him?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's our next stop," Dad said. He was grim. "He doesn't --" He stopped. "They say he'll be OK," he said. His voice was choked.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"How about Ange?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Her mother took her home. She wanted to wait here for you, but..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I understood. I felt full of understanding now, for how all the families of all the people who'd been locked away must feel. The courtroom was full of tears and hugs, and even the bailiffs couldn't stop it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's go see Darryl," I said. "And let me borrow your phone?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I called Ange on the way to the hospital where they were keeping Darryl -- San Francisco General, just down the street from us -- and arranged to see her after dinner. She talked in a hurried whisper. Her mom wasn't sure whether to punish her or not, but Ange didn't want to tempt fate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There were two state troopers in the corridor where Darryl was being held. They were holding off a legion of reporters who stood on tiptoe to see around them and get pictures. The flashes popped in our eyes like strobes, and I shook my head to clear it. My parents had brought me clean clothes and I'd changed in the back seat, but I still felt gross, even after scrubbing myself in the court-house bathrooms.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of the reporters called my name. Oh yeah, that's right, I was famous now. The state troopers gave me a look, too -- either they'd recognized my face or my name when the reporters called it out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Darryl's father met us at the door of his hospital room, speaking in a whisper too low for the reporters to hear. He was in civvies, the jeans and sweater I normally thought of him wearing, but he had his service ribbons pinned to his breast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's sleeping," he said. "He woke up a little while ago and he started crying. He couldn't stop. They gave him something to help him sleep."</p>
<p class="calibre1">He led us in, and there was Darryl, his hair clean and combed, sleeping with his mouth open. There was white stuff at the corners of his mouth. He had a semi-private room, and in the other bed there was an older Arab-looking guy, in his 40s. I realized it was the guy I'd been chained to on the way off of Treasure Island. We exchanged embarrassed waves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then I turned back to Darryl. I took his hand. His nails had been chewed to the quick. He'd been a nail-biter when he was a kid, but he'd kicked the habit when we got to high school. I think Van talked him out of it, telling him how gross it was for him to have his fingers in his mouth all the time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I heard my parents and Darryl's dad take a step away, drawing the curtains around us. I put my face down next to his on the pillow. He had a straggly, patchy beard that reminded me of Zeb.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, D," I said. "You made it. You're going to be OK."</p>
<p class="calibre1">He snored a little. I almost said, "I love you," a phrase I'd only said to one non-family-member ever, a phrase that was weird to say to another guy. In the end, I just gave his hand another squeeze. Poor Darryl.</p>
<p class="c3">Epilogue</p>
<p class="c5">This chapter is dedicated to Hudson Booksellers, the booksellers that are in practically every airport in the USA. Most of the Hudson stands have just a few titles (though those are often surprisingly diverse), but the big ones, like the one in the AA terminal at Chicago's O'Hare, are as good as any neighborhood store. It takes something special to bring a personal touch to an airport, and Hudson's has saved my mind on more than one long Chicago layover.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Barbara called me at the office on July 4th weekend. I wasn't the only one who'd come into work on the holiday weekend, but I was the only one whose excuse was that my day-release program wouldn't let me leave town.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the end, they convicted me of stealing Masha's phone. Can you believe that? The prosecution had done a deal with my lawyer to drop all charges related to "Electronic terrorism" and "inciting riots" in exchange for my pleading guilty to the misdemeanor petty theft charge. I got three months in a day-release program with a half-way house for juvenile offenders in the Mission. I slept at the halfway house, sharing a dorm with a bunch of actual criminals, gang kids and druggie kids, a couple of real nuts. During the day, I was "free" to go out and work at my "job."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Marcus, they're letting her go," she said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Johnstone, Carrie Johnstone," she said. "The closed military tribunal cleared her of any wrongdoing. The file is sealed. She's being returned to active duty. They're sending her to Iraq."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Carrie Johnstone was Severe Haircut Woman's name. It came out in the preliminary hearings at the California Superior Court, but that was just about all that came out. She wouldn't say a word about who she took orders from, what she'd done, who had been imprisoned and why. She just sat, perfectly silent, day after day, in the courthouse.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Feds, meanwhile, had blustered and shouted about the Governor's "unilateral, illegal" shut-down of the Treasure Island facility, and the Mayor's eviction of fed cops from San Francisco. A lot of those cops had ended up in state prisons, along with the guards from Gitmo-by-the-Bay.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, one day, there was no statement from the White House, nothing from the state capitol. And the next day, there was a dry, tense press-conference held jointly on the steps of the Governor's mansion, where the head of the DHS and the governor announced their "understanding."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The DHS would hold a closed, military tribunal to investigate "possible errors in judgment" committed after the attack on the Bay Bridge. The tribunal would use every tool at its disposal to ensure that criminal acts were properly punished. In return, control over DHS operations in California would go through the State Senate, which would have the power to shut down, inspect, or re-prioritize all homeland security in the state.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The roar of the reporters had been deafening and Barbara had gotten the first question in. "Mr Governor, with all due respect: we have incontrovertible video evidence that Marcus Yallow, a citizen of this state, native born, was subjected to a simulated execution by DHS officers, apparently acting on orders from the White House. Is the State really willing to abandon any pretense of justice for its citizens in the face of illegal, barbaric <i class="calibre6">torture</i>?" Her voice trembled, but didn't crack.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Governor spread his hands. "The military tribunals will accomplish justice. If Mr Yallow -- or any other person who has cause to fault the Department of Homeland Security -- wants further justice, he is, of course, entitled to sue for such damages as may be owing to him from the federal government."</p>
<p class="calibre1">That's what I was doing. Over twenty thousand civil lawsuits were filed against the DHS in the week after the Governor's announcement. Mine was being handled by the ACLU, and they'd filed motions to get at the results of the closed military tribunals. So far, the courts were pretty sympathetic to this.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But I hadn't expected this.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"She got off totally Scot-free?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The press release doesn't say much. 'After a thorough examination of the events in San Francisco and in the special anti-terror detention center on Treasure Island, it is the finding of this tribunal that Ms Johnstone's actions do not warrant further discipline.' There's that word, 'further' -- like they've already punished her."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I snorted. I'd dreamed of Carrie Johnstone nearly every night since I was released from Gitmo-by-the-Bay. I'd seen her face looming over mine, that little snarly smile as she told the man to give me a "drink."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Marcus --" Barbara said, but I cut her off.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's fine. It's fine. I'm going to do a video about this. Get it out over the weekend. Mondays are big days for viral video. Everyone'll be coming back from the holiday weekend, looking for something funny to forward around school or the office."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I saw a shrink twice a week as part of my deal at the halfway house. Once I'd gotten over seeing that as some kind of punishment, it had been good. He'd helped me focus on doing constructive things when I was upset, instead of letting it eat me up. The videos helped.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I have to go," I said, swallowing hard to keep the emotion out of my voice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Take care of yourself, Marcus," Barbara said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ange hugged me from behind as I hung up the phone. "I just read about it online," she said. She read a million newsfeeds, pulling them with a headline reader that sucked up stories as fast as they ended up on the wire. She was our official blogger, and she was good at it, snipping out the interesting stories and throwing them online like a short order cook turning around breakfast orders.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I turned around in her arms so that I was hugging her from in front. Truth be told, we hadn't gotten a lot of work done that day. I wasn't allowed to be out of the halfway house after dinner time, and she couldn't visit me there. We saw each other around the office, but there were usually a lot of other people around, which kind of put a crimp in our cuddling. Being alone in the office for a day was too much temptation. It was hot and sultry, too, which meant we were both in tank-tops and shorts, a lot of skin-to-skin contact as we worked next to each other.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm going to make a video," I said. "I want to release it today."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good," she said. "Let's do it."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ange read the press-release. I did a little monologue, synched over that famous footage of me on the water-board, eyes wild in the harsh light of the camera, tears streaming down my face, hair matted and flecked with barf.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is me. I am on a waterboard. I am being tortured in a simulated execution. The torture is supervised by a woman called Carrie Johnstone. She works for the government. You might remember her from this video."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I cut in the video of Johnstone and Kurt Rooney. "That's Johnstone and Secretary of State Kurt Rooney, the president's chief strategist."</p>
<p class="c5">"The nation does not love that city. As far as they're concerned, it is a Sodom and Gomorrah of fags and atheists who deserve to rot in hell. The only reason the country cares what they think in San Francisco is that they had the good fortune to have been blown to hell by some Islamic terrorists."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's talking about the city where I live. At last count, 4,215 of my neighbors were killed on the day he's talking about. But some of them may not have been killed. Some of them disappeared into the same prison where I was tortured. Some mothers and fathers, children and lovers, brothers and sisters will never see their loved ones again -- because they were secretly imprisoned in an illegal jail right here in the San Francisco Bay. They were shipped overseas. The records were meticulous, but Carrie Johnstone has the encryption keys." I cut back to Carrie Johnstone, the footage of her sitting at the board table with Rooney, laughing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I cut in the footage of Johnstone being arrested. "When they arrested her, I thought we'd get justice. All the people she broke and disappeared. But the president --" I cut to a still of him laughing and playing golf on one of his many holidays "-- and his Chief Strategist --" now a still of Rooney shaking hands with an infamous terrorist leader who used to be on "our side" "-- intervened. They sent her to a secret military tribunal and now that tribunal has cleared her. Somehow, they saw nothing wrong with all of this."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I cut in a photomontage of the hundreds of shots of prisoners in their cells that Barbara had published on the Bay Guardian's site the day we were released. "We elected these people. We pay their salaries. They're supposed to be on our side. They're supposed to defend our freedoms. But these people --" a series of shots of Johnstone and the others who'd been sent to the tribunal "-- betrayed our trust. The election is four months away. That's a lot of time. Enough for you to go out and find five of your neighbors -- five people who've given up on voting because their choice is 'none of the above.'</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Talk to your neighbors. Make them promise to vote. Make them promise to take the country back from the torturers and thugs. The people who laughed at my friends as they lay fresh in their graves at the bottom of the harbor. Make them promise to talk to their neighbors.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Most of us choose none of the above. It's not working. You have to choose -- choose freedom.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"My name is Marcus Yallow. I was tortured by my country, but I still love it here. I'm seventeen years old. I want to grow up in a free country. I want to live in a free country."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I faded out to the logo of the website. Ange had built it, with help from Jolu, who got us all the free hosting we could ever need on Pigspleen.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The office was an interesting place. Technically we were called Coalition of Voters for a Free America, but everyone called us the Xnetters. The organization -- a charitable nonprofit -- had been co-founded by Barbara and some of her lawyer friends right after the liberation of Treasure Island. The funding was kicked off by some tech millionaires who couldn't believe that a bunch of hacker kids had kicked the DHS's ass. Sometimes, they'd ask us to go down the peninsula to Sand Hill Road, where all the venture capitalists were, and give a little presentation on Xnet technology. There were about a zillion startups who were trying to make a buck on the Xnet.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whatever -- I didn't have to have anything to do with it, and I got a desk and an office with a storefront, right there on Valencia Street, where we gave away ParanoidXbox CDs and held workshops on building better WiFi antennas. A surprising number of average people dropped in to make personal donations, both of hardware (you can run ParanoidLinux on just about anything, not just Xbox Universals) and cash money. They loved us.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The big plan was to launch our own ARG in September, just in time for the election, and to really tie it in with signing up voters and getting them to the polls. Only 42 percent of Americans showed up at the polls for the last election -- nonvoters had a huge majority. I kept trying to get Darryl and Van to one of our planning sessions, but they kept on declining. They were spending a lot of time together, and Van insisted that it was totally nonromantic. Darryl wouldn't talk to me much at all, though he sent me long emails about just about everything that wasn't about Van or terrorism or prison.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ange squeezed my hand. "God, I hate that woman," she said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I nodded. "Just one more rotten thing this country's done to Iraq," I said. "If they sent her to my town, I'd probably become a terrorist."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You did become a terrorist when they sent her to your town."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So I did," I said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are you going to Ms Galvez's hearing on Monday?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Totally." I'd introduced Ange to Ms Galvez a couple weeks before, when my old teacher invited me over for dinner. The teacher's union had gotten a hearing for her before the board of the Unified School District to argue for getting her old job back. They said that Fred Benson was coming out of (early) retirement to testify against her. I was looking forward to seeing her again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do you want to go get a burrito?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Totally."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let me get my hot-sauce," she said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I checked my email one more time -- my PirateParty email, which still got a dribble of messages from old Xnetters who hadn't found my Coalition of Voters address yet.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The latest message was from a throwaway email address from one of the new Brazilian anonymizers.</p>
<p class="western5">&gt; Found her, thanks. You didn't tell me she was so h4wt.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who's <i class="calibre6">that</i> from?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I laughed. "Zeb," I said. "Remember Zeb? I gave him Masha's email address. I figured, if they're both underground, might as well introduce them to one another."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"He thinks Masha is <i class="calibre6">cute</i>?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Give the guy a break, he's clearly had his mind warped by circumstances."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"And you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Me?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah -- was your mind warped by circumstances?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I held Ange out at arm's length and looked her up and down and up and down. I held her cheeks and stared through her thick-framed glasses into her big, mischievous tilted eyes. I ran my fingers through her hair.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ange, I've never thought more clearly in my whole life."</p>
<p class="calibre1">She kissed me then, and I kissed her back, and it was some time before we went out for that burrito.</p>
<p class="c3">Afterword by Bruce Schneier</p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm a security technologist. My job is making people secure.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I think about security systems and how to break them. Then, how to make them more secure. Computer security systems. Surveillance systems. Airplane security systems and voting machines and RFID chips and everything else.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cory invited me into the last few pages of his book because he wanted me to tell you that security is fun. It's incredibly fun. It's cat and mouse, who can outsmart whom, hunter versus hunted fun. I think it's the most fun job you can possibly have. If you thought it was fun to read about Marcus outsmarting the gait-recognition cameras with rocks in his shoes, think of how much more fun it would be if you were the first person in the world to think of that.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Working in security means knowing a lot about technology. It might mean knowing about computers and networks, or cameras and how they work, or the chemistry of bomb detection. But really, security is a mindset. It's a way of thinking. Marcus is a great example of that way of thinking. He's always looking for ways a security system fails. I'll bet he couldn't walk into a store without figuring out a way to shoplift. Not that he'd do it -- there's a difference between knowing how to defeat a security system and actually defeating it -- but he'd know he could.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It's how security people think. We're constantly looking at security systems and how to get around them; we can't help it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This kind of thinking is important no matter what side of security you're on. If you've been hired to build a shoplift-proof store, you'd better know how to shoplift. If you're designing a camera system that detects individual gaits, you'd better plan for people putting rocks in their shoes. Because if you don't, you're not going to design anything good.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So when you're wandering through your day, take a moment to look at the security systems around you. Look at the cameras in the stores you shop at. (Do they prevent crime, or just move it next door?) See how a restaurant operates. (If you pay after you eat, why don't more people just leave without paying?) Pay attention at airport security. (How could you get a weapon onto an airplane?) Watch what the teller does at a bank. (Bank security is designed to prevent tellers from stealing just as much as it is to prevent you from stealing.) Stare at an anthill. (Insects are all about security.) Read the Constitution, and notice all the ways it provides people with security against government. Look at traffic lights and door locks and all the security systems on television and in the movies. Figure out how they work, what threats they protect against and what threats they don't, how they fail, and how they can be exploited.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spend enough time doing this, and you'll find yourself thinking differently about the world. You'll start noticing that many of the security systems out there don't actually do what they claim to, and that much of our national security is a waste of money. You'll understand privacy as essential to security, not in opposition. You'll stop worrying about things other people worry about, and start worrying about things other people don't even think about.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes you'll notice something about security that no one has ever thought about before. And maybe you'll figure out a new way to break a security system.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was only a few years ago that someone invented phishing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm frequently amazed how easy it is to break some pretty big-name security systems. There are a lot of reasons for this, but the big one is that it's impossible to prove that something is secure. All you can do is try to break it -- if you fail, you know that it's secure enough to keep <i class="calibre6">you</i> out, but what about someone who's smarter than you? Anyone can design a security system so strong he himself can't break it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Think about that for a second, because it's not obvious. No one is qualified to analyze their own security designs, because the designer and the analyzer will be the same person, with the same limits. Someone else has to analyze the security, because it has to be secure against things the designers didn't think of.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This means that all of us have to analyze the security that other people design. And surprisingly often, one of us breaks it. Marcus's exploits aren't far-fetched; that kind of thing happens all the time. Go onto the net and look up "bump key" or "Bic pen Kryptonite lock"; you'll find a couple of really interesting stories about seemingly strong security defeated by pretty basic technology.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And when that happens, be sure to publish it on the Internet somewhere. Secrecy and security aren't the same, even though it may seem that way. Only bad security relies on secrecy; good security works even if all the details of it are public.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And publishing vulnerabilities forces security designers to design better security, and makes us all better consumers of security. If you buy a Kryptonite bike lock and it can be defeated with a Bic pen, you're not getting very good security for your money. And, likewise, if a bunch of smart kids can defeat the DHS's antiterrorist technologies, then it's not going to do a very good job against real terrorists.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Trading privacy for security is stupid enough; not getting any actual security in the bargain is even stupider.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So close the book and go. The world is full of security systems. Hack one of them.</p>

<p class="c3">Afterword by Andrew "bunnie" Huang, Xbox Hacker</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hackers are explorers, digital pioneers. It's in a hacker's nature to question conventions and be tempted by intricate problems. Any complex system is sport for a hacker; a side effect of this is the hacker's natural affinity for problems involving security. Society is a large and complex system, and is certainly not off limits to a little hacking. As a result, hackers are often stereotyped as iconoclasts and social misfits, people who defy social norms for the sake of defiance. When I hacked the Xbox in 2002 while at MIT, I wasnât doing it to rebel or to cause harm; I was just following a natural impulse, the same impulse that leads to fixing a broken iPod or exploring the roofs and tunnels at MIT. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately, the combination of not complying with social norms and knowing âthreateningâ things like how to read the arphid on your credit card or how to pick locks causes some people to fear hackers. However, the motivations of a hacker are typically as simple as âIâm an engineer because I like to design things.â People often ask me, âWhy did you hack the Xbox security system?â And my answer is simple: First, I own the things that I buy. If someone can tell me what I can and canât run on my hardware, then I donât own it. Second, because itâs there. Itâs a system of sufficient complexity to make good sport. It was a great diversion from the late nights working on my PhD.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was lucky. The fact that I was a graduate student at MIT when I hacked the Xbox legitimized the activity in the eyes of the right people. However, the right to hack shouldnât only be extended to academics. I got my start on hacking when I was just a boy in elementary school, taking apart every electronic appliance I could get my hands on, much to my parentsâ chagrin. My reading collection included books on model rocketry, artillery, nuclear weaponry and explosives manufacture -- books that I borrowed from my school library (I think the Cold War influenced the reading selection in public schools). I also played with my fair share of ad-hoc fireworks and roamed the open construction sites of houses being raised in my Midwestern neighborhood. While not the wisest of things to do, these were important experiences in my coming of age and I grew up to be a free thinker because of the social tolerance and trust of my community.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Current events have not been so kind to aspiring hackers. Little Brother shows how we can get from where we are today to a world where social tolerance for new and different thoughts dies altogether. A recent event highlights exactly how close we are to crossing the line into the world of Little Brother. I had the fortune of reading an early draft of Little Brother back in November 2006. Fast forward two months to the end of January 2007, when Boston police found suspected explosive devices and shut down the city for a day. These devices turned out to be nothing more than circuit boards with flashing LEDs, promoting a show for the Cartoon Network. The artists who placed this urban graffiti were taken in as suspected terrorists and ultimately charged with felony; the network producers had to shell out a $2 million settlement, and the head of the Cartoon Network resigned over the fallout. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Have the terrorists already won? Have we given in to fear, such that artists, hobbyists, hackers, iconoclasts, or perhaps an unassuming group of kids playing Harajuku Fun Madness, could be so trivially implicated as terrorists?</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is a term for this dysfunction -- it is called an autoimmune disease, where an organism's defense system goes into overdrive so much that it fails to recognize itself and attacks its own cells. Ultimately, the organism self-destructs. Right now, America is on the verge of going into anaphylactic shock over its own freedoms, and we need to inoculate ourselves against this. Technology is no cure for this paranoia; in fact, it may enhance the paranoia: it turns us into prisoners of our own device. Coercing millions of people to strip off their outer garments and walk barefoot through metal detectors every day is no solution either. It only serves to remind the population every day that they have a reason to be afraid, while in practice providing only a flimsy barrier to a determined adversary.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The truth is that we can't count on someone else to make us feel free, and M1k3y wonât come and save us the day our freedoms are lost to paranoia. That's because M1k3y is in you and in me--Little Brother is a reminder that no matter how unpredictable the future may be, we don't win freedom through security systems, cryptography, interrogations and spot searches. We win freedom by having the courage and the conviction to live every day freely and to act as a free society, no matter how great the threats are on the horizon.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Be like M1k3y: step out the door and dare to be free.</p>

<a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Hacking</a> is a great subject. All science relies on telling other people what you've done so that they can verify it, learn from it, and improve on it, and hacking is all about that process, so there's plenty published on the subject.<br class="calibre2"/>
<br class="calibre2"/>
Start with Andrew "Bunnie" Huang's <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">"Hacking the Xbox,"</a> (No Starch Press, 2003) a wonderful book that tells the story of how Bunnie, then a student at MIT, reverse-engineered the Xbox's anti-tampering mechanisms and opened the way for all the subsequent cool hacks for the platform.

Speaking of Bruce Sterling, he wrote the first great book on hackers and the law, <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">"The Hacker Crackdown"</a> (Bantam, 1993), which is also the first book published by a major publisher that was released on the Internet at the same time (copies abound; see <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">stuff.mit.edu/hacker/hacker.html</a> for one). It was reading this book that turned me on to the <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, where I was privileged to work for four years.<br class="calibre2"/>
<br class="calibre2"/>
The <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Electronic Frontier Foundation (www.eff.org)</a> is a charitable membership organization with a student rate. They spend the money that private individuals give them to keep the Internet safe for personal liberty, free speech, due process, and the rest of the Bill of Rights. They're the Internet's most effective freedom fighters, and you can join the struggle just by signing up for <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">their mailing list</a> and writing to your elected officials when they're considering selling you out in the name of fighting terrorism, piracy, the mafia, or whatever bogeyman has caught their attention today. EFF also helps maintain <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">TOR, The Onion Router</a>, which is a real technology you can use right now to get out of your government, school or library's censoring firewall (<a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">tor.eff.org</a>).<br class="calibre2"/>
<br class="calibre2"/>
EFF has a huge, deep website with amazing information aimed at a general audience, as do the <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">American Civil Liberties Union (aclu.org)</a>, <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Public Knowledge (publicknowledge.org)</a>, <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">FreeCulture (freeculture.org)</a>, <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Creative Commons (creativecommons.org)</a> -- all of which also are worthy of your support. <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">FreeCulture</a> is an international student movement that actively recruits kids to found their own local chapters at their high schools and universities. It's a great way to get involved and make a difference.<br class="calibre2"/>
<br class="calibre2"/>
A lot of websites chronicle the fight for cyberliberties, but few go at it with the verve of <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Slashdot, "News for Nerds, Stuff That Matters" (slashdot.org)</a>.<br class="calibre2"/>
<br class="calibre2"/>
And of course, you have to visit <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Wikipedia</a>, the collaborative, net-authored encyclopedia that anyone can edit, with more than 1,000,000 entries in English alone. Wikipedia covers hacking and counterculture in astonishing depth and with amazing, up-to-the-nanosecond currency. One caution: you can't just look at the entries in Wikipedia. It's really important to look at the "History" and "Discussion" links at the top of every Wikipedia page to see how the current version of the truth was arrived at, get an appreciation for the competing points-of-view there, and decide for yourself whom you trust.<br class="calibre2"/>
<br class="calibre2"/>
If you want to get at some real forbidden knowledge, have a skim around <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Cryptome (cryptome.org)</a>, the world's most amazing archive of secret, suppressed and liberated information. Cryptome's brave publishers collect material that's been pried out of the state by Freedom of Information Act requests or leaked by whistle-blowers and publishes it.<br class="calibre2"/>
<br class="calibre2"/>
The best fictional account of the history of crypto is, hands-down, Neal Stephenson's <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Cryptonomicon</a> (Avon, 2002). Stephenson tells the story of <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Alan Turing</a> and the Nazi Enigma Machine, turning it into a gripping war-novel that you won't be able to put down.<br class="calibre2"/>
<br class="calibre2"/>
The <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Pirate Party</a> mentioned in Little Brother is real and thriving in Sweden (<a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">www.piratpartiet.se</a>), Denmark, the USA and France at the time of this writing (July, 2006). They're a little out-there, but a movement takes all kinds.<br class="calibre2"/>
<br class="calibre2"/>
Speaking of out-there, <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Abbie Hoffman</a> and the <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Yippies</a> did indeed try to levitate the Pentagon, throw money into the stock exchange, and work with a group called the <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers</a>. Abbie Hoffman's classic book on ripping off the system, <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">"Steal This Book,"</a> is back in print (Four Walls Eight Windows, 2002) and it's also online as a collaborative wiki for people who want to try to update it ( <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">stealthiswiki.nine9pages.com</a>).<br class="calibre2"/>
<br class="calibre2"/>
Hoffman's autobiography, <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">"Soon to Be a Major Motion Picture"</a> (also in print from Four Walls Eight Windows) is one of my favorite memoirs ever, even if it is highly fictionalized. Hoffman was an incredible storyteller and had great activist instincts. If you want to know how he really lived his life, though, try Larry Sloman's <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">"Steal This Dream"</a> (Doubleday, 1998).<br class="calibre2"/>
<br class="calibre2"/>
More counterculture fun: Jack Kerouac's <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">"On the Road"</a> can be had in practically any used bookstore for a buck or two. Allan Ginsberg's <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">"HOWL"</a> is online in many places, and you can hear him read it if you search for the <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">MP3 at archive.org</a>. For bonus points, track down the album <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">"Tenderness Junction"</a> by the Fugs, which includes the audio of Allan Ginsberg and Abbie Hoffman's levitation ceremony at the Pentagon.<br class="calibre2"/>
<br class="calibre2"/>
This book couldn't have been written if not for George Orwell's magnificent, world-changing <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">"1984,"</a> the best novel ever published on how societies go wrong. I read this book when I was 12 and have read it 30 or 40 times since, and every time, I get something new out of it. Orwell was a master of storytelling and was clearly sick over the totalitarian state that emerged in the Soviet Union. 1984 holds up today as a genuinely frightening work of science fiction, and it is one of the novels that literally changed the world. Today, "Orwellian" is synonymous with a state of ubiquitous surveillance, doublethink, and torture.<br class="calibre2"/>
<br class="calibre2"/>
Many novelists have tackled parts of the story in Little Brother. Daniel Pinkwater's towering comic masterpiece, <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">"Alan Mendelsohn: The Boy From Mars"</a> (presently in print as part of the omnibus <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">"5 Novels,"</a> Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1997) is a book that every geek needs to read. If you've ever felt like an outcast for being too smart or weird, READ THIS BOOK. It changed my life.<br class="calibre2"/>
<br class="calibre2"/>
On a more contemporary front, there's Scott Westerfeld's <a tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">"So Yesterday"</a> (Razorbill, 2004), which follows the adventures of cool hunters and counterculture jammers. Scott and his wife Justine Larbalestier were my partial inspiration to write a book for young adults -- as was Kathe Koja. Thanks, guys.</p>
