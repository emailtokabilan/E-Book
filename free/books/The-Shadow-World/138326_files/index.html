<p class="calibre1">This	 book	 is	 a	 faithful	 record,	 so	 far	 as	 I	 can	 make	 it,	 of	 the	 most	 marvellous phenomena	 which	 have	 come	 under	 my	 observation	 during	 the	 last	 sixteen	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1">seventeen	years.	I	have	used	my	notes	(made	immediately	after	the	sittings)	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">also	my	reports	to	the	American	Psychical	Society	(of	which	I	was	at	one	time	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">director)	 as	 the	 basis	 of	 my	 story.	 For	 literary	 purposes	 I	 have	 substituted fictitious	 names	 for	 real	 names,	 and	 imaginary	 characters	 for	 the	 actual</p>
<p class="calibre1">individuals	 concerned;	 but	 I	 have	 not	 allowed	 these	 necessary	 expedients	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">interfere	with	the	precise	truth	of	the	account. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 example,  <i class="calibre4">Miller</i>,	 an	 imaginary	 chemist,	 has	 been	 put	 in	 the	 place	 of	 a scientist	 much	 older	 than	 thirty-five,	 in	 whose	 library	 the	 inexplicable	 "third sitting"	took	place.  <i class="calibre4">Fowler</i>,	also,	is	not	intended	to	depict	an	individual.	The	man in	whose	shoes	he	stands	is	one	of	the	most	widely	read	and	deeply	experienced</p>
<p class="calibre1">spiritists	I	have	ever	known,	and	I	have	sincerely	tried	to	present	through	 <i class="calibre4">Fowler</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 argument	 which	 his	 prototype	 might	 have	 used.  <i class="calibre4">Mrs.	 Quigg</i>,  <i class="calibre4">Miss	 Brush</i>, <i class="calibre4">Howard</i>,	the	 <i class="calibre4">Camerons</i>,	and	most	of	the	others,	are	purely	imaginary.	The	places in	 which	 the	 sittings	 took	 place	 are	 not	 indicated,	 for	 the	 reason	 that	 I	 do	 not wish	to	involve	any	unwilling	witnesses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 case	 of	 the	 psychics,	 they	 are,	 of	 course,	 delineated	 exactly	 as	 they appeared	 to	 me,	 although	 I	 have	 concealed	 their	 real	 names	 and	 places	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">residence.  <i class="calibre4">Mrs.	Smiley</i>,	whose	admirable	patience	under	investigation	makes	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	 almost	 ideal	 subject,	 is	 the	 chief	 figure	 among	 my	 "mediums,"	 and	 I	 have tried	to	give	her	attitude	toward	us	and	toward	her	faith	as	she	expressed	it	in	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">sittings,	 although	 the	 conversation	 is	 necessarily	 a	 mixture	 of	 imagination	 and memory.  <i class="calibre4">Mrs.	 Hartley</i>	 is	 a	 very	 real	 and	 vigorous	 character—a	 professional psychic,	it	is	true,	but	a	woman	of	intelligence	and	power.	Those	in	private	life	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 guarded	 with	 scrupulous	 care,	 and	 I	 am	 sure	 that	 none	 of	 them,	 either</p>
<p class="calibre1">private	 or	 professional,	 will	 feel	 that	 I	 have	 wilfully	 misrepresented	 what	 took place.	 My	 aim	 throughout	 has	 been	 to	 deal	 directly	 and	 simply	 with	 the	 facts involved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 have	 not	 attempted	 to	 be	 profound	 or	 mystical	 or	 even	 scientific,	 but	 I	 have tried	to	present	clearly,	simply,	and	as	nearly	without	bias	as	possible,	an	account</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	what	I	have	seen	and	heard.	The	weight	of	evidence	seems,	at	the	moment,	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a>be	on	the	side	of	the	biologists;	but	I	am	willing	to	reopen	the	case	at	any	time, although	I	am,	above	all,	a	man	of	the	open	air,	of	the	plains	and	the	mountains, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	do	not	intend	to	identify	myself	with	any	branch	of	metapsychical	research. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	probable,	therefore,	that	this	is	my	one	and	final	contribution	to	the	study	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">the	shadow	world</i>. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A	 hush	 fell	 over	 the	 dinner-table,	 and	 every	 ear	 was	 open	 and	 inclined	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cameron,	 the	 host,	 continued:	 "No,	 I	 wouldn't	 say	 that.	 There	 are	 some	 things that	are	pretty	well	established—telepathy,	for	instance." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	believe	even	in	telepathy,"	asserted	Mrs.	Quigg,	a	very	positive	journalist who	sat	at	his	right.	"I	think	even	 <i class="calibre4">that</i>	is	mere	coincidence." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several	voices	rose	in	a	chorus	of	protest.	"Oh	no!	Telepathy	is	real.	Why,	I've</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	experiences—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	you	go!"	replied	Mrs.	Quigg,	still	in	the	heat	of	her	opposition.	"You	will all	tell	the	same	story.	Your	friend	was	dying	in	Bombay	or	Vienna,	and	his	spirit</p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared	to	you,  <i class="calibre4">à	la	Journal	of	Psychic	Research</i>,	with	a	message,	at	the	exact</p>
<p class="calibre1">hour,	computing	difference	in	time	(which	no	one	ever	does),	and	so	on.	I	know</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	kind	of	thing—but	that	isn't	telepathy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	is	telepathy,	then?"	asked	little	Miss	Brush,	who	paints	miniatures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	can't	describe	a	thing	that	doesn't	exist,"	replied	Mrs.	Quigg.	"The	word	means feeling	at	a	distance,	does	it	not,	professor?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harris,	 a	 teacher	 of	 English,	 who	 seldom	 took	 a	 serious	 view	 of	 anything, </p>
<p class="calibre1">answered,	"I	should	call	it	a	long-distance	touch." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	 you	 believe	 in	 hypnotism,	 Dr.	 Miller?"	 asked	 Miss	 Brush,	 quietly addressing	her	neighbor,	a	young	scientist	whose	specialty	was	chemistry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	replied	he;	"I	don't	believe	in	a	single	one	of	these	supernatural	forces." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	mean	you	don't	believe	in	anything	you	have	not	seen	yourself,"	said	I. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	this	Miller	slowly	replied:	"I	believe	in	Vienna,	which	I	have	never	seen,	but	I don't	believe	in	a	Vienna	doctor	who	claims	to	be	able	to	hypnotize	a	man	so	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	can	smile	while	his	leg	is	being	taken	off." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	that's	a	fact,"	stated	Brierly,	the	portrait-painter;	"that	happens	every	day	in our	hospitals	here	in	New	York	City." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>"Have	you	ever	seen	it	done?"	asked	Miller,	bristling	with	opposition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,"	 asserted	 Miller,	 "I	 wouldn't	 believe	 it	 even	 if	 I	 saw	 the	 operation performed." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	 don't	 believe	 in	 any	 mystery	 unless	 it	 is	 familiar,"	 said	 I,	 warming	 to	 the contest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	certainly	do	not	believe	in	these	childish	mysteries,"	responded	Miller,	"and	it is	strange	to	me	that	men	like	Sir	Oliver	Lodge	and	Sir	William	Crookes	should</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe	in	slate-writing	and	levitation	and	all	the	rest	of	that	hocus-pocus." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nevertheless,	hypnotism	is	a	fact,"	insisted	Brierly.	"You	must	have	some	faith in	the	big	books	on	the	subject	filled	with	proof.	Think	of	the	tests—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	call	it	a	test	to	stick	pins	into	a	person's	tongue,"	said	Mrs.	Quigg.	"We newspaper	people	all	know	that	there	are	in	the	hypnotic	business	what	they	call</p>
<p class="calibre1">'horses'—that	 is	 to	 say,	 wretched	 men	 and	 boys,	 women	 sometimes,	 who	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">trained	themselves	so	that	they	can	hold	hot	pennies,	eat	red	pepper,	and	do	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">'stunts'—we've	had	their	confessions	times	enough." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	 but	 their	 confessions	 are	 never	 quite	 complete,"	 retorted	 young	 Howard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"When	I	was	in	college	I	had	one	of	these	'horses'	appeal	to	me	for	help.	He	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	 of	 a	 job,	 and	 I	 told	 him	 I'd	 blow	 him	 to	 the	 supper	 of	 his	 life	 if	 he	 would render	up	the	secrets	of	his	trade.	He	took	my	offer,	but	jarred	me	by	confessing</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	the	professor	really	could	hypnotize	him.	He	had	to	make	believe	only	part</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	time.	His	'stunts'	were	mostly	real." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	the	same	way	with	mediums,"	said	I.	"I	have	had	a	good	deal	of	experience with	 them,	 and	 I've	 come	 to	 the	 conclusion	 that	 they	 all,	 even	 the	 most</p>
<p class="calibre1">untrustworthy	of	them,	start	with	at	least	some	small	basis	of	abnormal	power.	Is</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 not	 rather	 suggestive	 that	 the	 number	 of	 practising	 mediums	 does	 not</p>
<p class="calibre1">materially	 increase?	 If	 it	 were	 a	 mere	 matter	 of	 deception,	 would	 there	 not	 be thousands	 at	 the	 trade?	 As	 a	 matter	 of	 fact,	 there	 are	 not	 fifty	 advertising mediums	 in	 New	 York	 at	 this	 moment,	 though	 of	 course	 the	 number	 is	 kept</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	by	the	feeling	that	it	is	a	bit	disreputable	to	have	these	powers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're	 too	 easy	 on	 them,"	 said	 Howard.	 "I	 never	 saw	 one	 that	 wasn't	 a	 cheap skate." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>Again	I	protested.	"Don't	be	hasty.	There	are	nice	ones.	My	own	mother	had	this power	in	her	youth,	so	my	father	tells	me.	Her	people	were	living	in	Wisconsin</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	the	time	when	this	psychic	force	developed	in	her,	and	the	settlers	from	many</p>
<p class="calibre1">miles	 around	 came	 to	 see	 her	 'perform.'	 An	 uncle,	 when	 a	 boy	 of	 four,	 did</p>
<p class="calibre1">automatic	writing,	and	one	of	my	aunts	recently	wrote	to	me,	in	relation	to	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">book	 <i class="calibre4">The	Tyranny	of	the	Dark</i>,	that	for	two	years	(beginning	when	she	was	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">seventeen)	these	powers	of	darkness	made	her	life	a	hell.	It	won't	do	to	be	hasty</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	condemning	the	mediums	wholesale.	There	are	many	decent	people	who	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">possessed	 by	 strange	 forces,	 but	 are	 shy	 of	 confessing	 their	 abnormalities.	 Ask your	 family	 physician.	 He	 will	 tell	 you	 that	 he	 always	 has	 at	 least	 one	 patient who	is	troubled	by	occult	powers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Medical	men	call	it	'hysteria,'"	said	Harris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Which	doesn't	explain	anything,"	I	answered.	"Many	apparently	healthy	people possess	the	more	elementary	of	these	powers—often	without	knowing	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	are	all	telepathic	in	some	degree,"	declared	Brierly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Perhaps	 all	 the	 so-called	 messages	 from	 the	 dead	 come	 from	 living	 minds,"	 I suggested—"I	 mean	 the	 minds	 of	 those	 about	 us.	 Dr.	 Reed,	 a	 friend	 of	 mine, once	 arranged	 to	 go	 with	 a	 patient	 to	 have	 a	 test	 sitting	 with	 a	 very	 celebrated psychic	who	claimed	to	be	able	to	read	sealed	letters.	Just	before	the	appointed</p>
<p class="calibre1">day,	Reed's	patient	died	suddenly	of	heart-disease,	leaving	a	sealed	letter	on	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">desk.	 The	 doctor,	 fully	 alive	 to	 the	 singular	 opportunity,	 put	 the	 letter	 in	 his pocket	 and	 hastened	 to	 the	 medium.	 The	 magician	 took	 it	 in	 his	 hand	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">pondered.	At	last	he	said:	'This	was	written	by	a	man	now	in	the	spirit	world.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">cannot	sense	it.	There	isn't	a	medium	in	the	world	who	can	read	it,	but	if	you	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">send	it	to	any	person	anywhere	on	the	planet	and	have	it	read	and	resealed,	I	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell	you	what	is	in	it.	I	cannot	get	the	words	unless	some	mind	in	the	earth-plane</p>
<p class="calibre1">has	absorbed	them.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harris	spoke	first.	"That	would	seem	to	prove	a	sort	of	universal	mind	reservoir, </p>
<p class="calibre1">wouldn't	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	 is	 the	 way	 my	 friend	 figured	 it.	 But	 isn't	 that	 a	 staggering	 hypothesis?	 I have	never	had	a	sealed	letter	read,	but	the	psychic	research	people	seem	to	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">absolutely	proved	psychometry	to	be	a	fact.	After	you	read	Myers	you	are	ready</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	believe	anything—or	nothing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	hostess	rose.	"Suppose	we	go	into	the	library	and	have	more	ghost	stories. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>Come,	Mr.	Garland,	we	can't	leave	you	men	here	to	talk	yourselves	out	on	these interesting	subjects.	You	must	let	us	all	hear	what	you	have	to	say." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	more	or	less	jocose	mood	the	company	trooped	out	to	the	library,	where	a	fire</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 glowing	 in	 the	 grate	 and	 easy-chairs	 abounded.	 The	 younger	 people, </p>
<p class="calibre1">bringing	cushions,	placed	themselves	beside	the	hearth,	while	I	took	a	seat	near</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Cameron	and	Harris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There!"	said	Miss	Brush,	with	a	gurgle	of	delight.	"This	is	more	like	the	proper light	 and	 surroundings	 for	 creepy	 tales.	 Please	 go	 on,	 Mr.	 Garland.	 You	 said you'd	had	a	good	deal	of	experience—tell	us	all	about	it.	I	always	think	of	you	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 trailer,	 a	 man	 of	 the	 plains.	 How	 did	 you	 happen	 to	 get	 into	 this	 shadow world?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	came	about	while	I	was	living	in	Boston.	It	was	in	1891,	or	possibly	1892.	A</p>
<p class="calibre1">friend,	the	editor	of	the	 <i class="calibre4">Arena</i>,	asked	me	to	become	a	member	of	the	American</p>
<p class="calibre1">Psychical	 Society,	 which	 he	 was	 helping	 to	 form.	 He	 wished	 me	 to	 go	 on	 the Board	 of	 Directors,	 because,	 as	 he	 said,	 I	 was	 'young,	 a	 keen	 observer,	 and without	emotional	bias'—by	which	he	meant	that	I	had	not	been	bereaved." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Quite	right;	the	loss	of	a	child	or	a	wife	weakens	even	the	best	of	us	illogical," </p>
<p class="calibre1">commented	Harris.	"No	man	who	is	mourning	a	relative	has	any	business	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">calling	himself	an	investigator	of	spiritualism." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	the	upshot	was,	I	joined	the	society,	became	a	member	of	the	Executive</p>
<p class="calibre1">Board,	 was	 made	 a	 special	 committee	 on	 'physical	 phenomena'—that	 is	 to	 say, </p>
<p class="calibre1">slate-writing,	 levitation,	 and	 the	 like—and	 set	 to	 work.	 It	 was	 like	 entering	 a new,	vague,	and	mysterious	world.	The	first	case	I	investigated	brought	out	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	most	fundamental	of	these	facts,	which	is,	that	this	shadow	world	lies	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">close	to	the	sunny,	so-called	normal	day.	The	secretary	of	the	society	had	already</p>
<p class="calibre1">begun	 to	 receive	 calls	 for	 help.	 A	 mechanic	 had	 written	 from	 South	 Boston</p>
<p class="calibre1">asking	us	to	see	his	wife's	automatic	writing,	and	a	farmer	had	come	down	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Concord	to	tell	us	of	a	haunted	house	and	the	mysterious	rappings	on	its	walls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Almost	in	a	day	I	was	made	aware	of	the	illusory	side	of	life." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why	illusory?"	asked	Brierly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let	us	call	it	that	for	the	present,"	I	answered.	"Among	those	who	wrote	to	us was	a	woman	from	Lowell	whose	daughter	had	developed	strange	powers.	Her</p>
<p class="calibre1">account,	so	straightforward	and	so	precise,	determined	us	to	investigate	the	case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore,	our	secretary	(a	young	clergyman)	and	I	took	the	train	for	Lowell	one</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>autumn	 afternoon.	 We	 found	 Mrs.	 Jones	 living	 in	 a	 small,	 old-fashioned	 frame house	standing	hard	against	the	sidewalk,	and	through	the	parlor	windows,	while</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	 awaited	 the	 psychic,	 I	 watched	 an	 endless	 line	 of	 derby	 hats	 as	 the	 town's mechanics	plodded	by—incessant	reminders	of	the	practical,	hard-headed	world</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	filled	the	street.	This	was,	indeed,	a	typical	case.	In	half	an	hour	we	were	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">sitting	about	the	table	in	a	dim	light,	while	the	sweet-voiced	mother	was	talking</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	'Charley,'	her	'poltergeist'—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	is	that,	please?"	asked	Mrs.	Quigg. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 word	 means	 a	 rollicking	 spirit	 who	 throws	 things	 about.	 I	 did	 not	 value what	happened	at	this	sitting,	for	the	conditions	were	all	the	psychic's	own.	By-the-way,	she	was	a	large,	blond,	strapping	girl	of	twenty	or	so—one	of	the	mill-</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands—not	 in	 the	 least	 the	 sickly,	 morbid	 creature	 I	 had	 expected	 to	 see.	 As	 I say,	the	conditions	were	such	as	to	make	what	took	place	of	no	scientific	value, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I	turned	in	no	report	upon	it;	but	it	was	all	very	curious." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	happened?	Don't	skip,"	bade	Mrs.	Cameron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	the	table	rapped	and	heaved	and	slid	about.	A	chair	crawled	to	my	lap	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	last	to	the	top	of	the	table,	apparently	of	its	own	motion.	A	little	rocking-chair</p>
<p class="calibre1">moved	to	and	fro	precisely	as	if	some	one	were	sitting	in	it,	and	so	on.	It	was	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">unconvincing	 at	 the	 time,	 but	 as	 I	 look	 back	 upon	 it	 now,	 after	 years	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">experience,	I	am	inclined	to	think	part	of	it	at	least	was	genuine.	And	this	brings</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	 to	 say	 to	 Mrs.	 Quigg,	 and	 to	 any	 other	 doubter,	 that	 you	 have	 only	 to	 step aside	into	silence	and	shadow	and	wait	for	a	moment—and	the	bewildering	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">happen,	 or	 you	 will	 imagine	 it	 to	 happen.	 I	 will	 agree	 to	 furnish	 from	 this company	a	medium	that	will	astonish	even	our	materialistic	friend	Miller." </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	loud	outcry:	"What	do	you	mean?	Explain	yourself!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 am	 perfectly	 certain	 that	 if	 this	 company	 will	 sit	 as	 I	 direct	 for	 twenty-one days	at	the	same	hour,	in	the	same	room,	under	the	same	conditions,	phenomena</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	develop	which	will	not	merely	amaze	but	scare	some	of	you;	and	as	for	you, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	 Quigg,	 you	 who	 are	 so	 certain	 that	 nothing	 ever	 happens,	 you	 will	 be	 the first	to	turn	pale	with	awe." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Try	me!	I	am	wild	to	be	'shown.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harris	 was	 not	 so	 boastful.	 "You	 mean,	 of	 course,	 that	 some	 of	 these	 highly cultured	ladies	would	develop	hysteria?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>"I	 am	 not	 naming	 the	 condition;	 I	 only	 say	 that	 I	 have	 seen	 some	 very	 hard-headed	 and	 self-contained	 people	 cut	 strange	 capers.	 The	 trance	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">'impersonation'	usually	come	first." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's	do	it!"	cried	out	Miss	Brush.	"It	would	be	such	fun!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You'd	be	the	first	to	'go	off,'"	said	I,	banteringly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harris	agreed.	"She	is	neuropathic." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 propose	 we	 start	 a	 psychic	 society	 here	 and	 now,"	 said	 Cameron.	 "I'll	 be president,	 Mrs.	 Quigg	 secretary,	 and	 Garland	 can	 be	 the	 director	 of	 the	 awful rites.	Miss	Brush,	you	shall	be	the	'mejum.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh	no,	no!"	she	cried,	"please	let	some	one	else	be	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	amused	me,	but	I	seized	upon	Cameron's	notion.	"I	accept	the	arrangement</p>
<p class="calibre1">provided	you	do	not	hold	me	responsible	for	any	ill	effects,"	I	said.	"It's	ticklish business.	There	are	many	who	hold	the	whole	process	diabolic." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	the	house	ready	for	the	question?"	asked	Cameron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ay,	ay!"	shouted	every	one	present. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	society	is	formed,"	announced	Cameron.	"As	president,	I	suggest	a	sitting right	now.	How	about	it,	Garland?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Certainly!"	 I	 answered,	 "for	 I	 have	 an	 itching	 in	 my	 thumbs	 that	 tells	 me something	witching	this	way	comes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guests	rose	in	a	flutter	of	pleased	excitement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	do	we	go	at	it?"	asked	Mrs.	Cameron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	first	requisite	is	a	small	table—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why	a	table?"	asked	Mrs.	Quigg. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	theory	is	that	it	helps	to	concentrate	the	minds	of	the	sitters,	and	it	will	also furnish	a	convenient	place	to	rest	our	hands.	Anyhow,	all	the	great	investigators</p>
<p class="calibre1">began	this	way,"	I	replied,	pacifically.	"We	may	also	require	a	pencil	and	a	pad." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller	was	on	his	dignity.	"I	decline	to	sit	at	a	table	in	that	foolish	way.	I	shall look	on	in	lonely	grandeur." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>The	others	were	eager	to	"sit	in,"	as	young	Howard	called	it,	and	soon	nine	of	us were	 seated	 about	 an	 oblong	 mahogany	 table.	 Brierly	 was	 very	 serious,	 Miss</p>
<p class="calibre1">Brush	ecstatic,	and	Mrs.	Harris	rather	nervous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 was	 careful	 to	 prepare	 them	 all	 for	 failure.	 "This	 is	 only	 a	 trial	 sitting,	 you know,	merely	to	get	our	hands	in,"	I	warned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Must	we	keep	still?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh	no!	You	may	talk,	if	you	do	so	quietly.	Please	touch	fingers,	so	as	to	make	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">complete	 circuit.	 I	 don't	 think	 it	 really	 necessary,	 but	 it	 sometimes	 helps	 to produce	 the	 proper	 mental	 state;	 singing	 softly	 also	 tends	 to	 harmonize	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">'conditions,'	 as	 the	 professionals	 say.	 Don't	 argue	 and	 don't	 be	 too	 eager.	 Lean back	and	rest.	Take	a	passive	attitude	toward	the	whole	problem.	I	find	the	whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">process	very	restful.	Harris,	will	you	turn	down	the	lights	before—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There!"	said	Miller,	"the	hocus-pocus	begins.	Why	not	perform	in	the	light?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Subdued	 light	 will	 bring	 the	 proper	 negative	 and	 inward	 condition	 sooner,"	 I replied,	 taking	 a	 malicious	 delight	 in	 his	 disgust.	 "Now	 will	 some	 one	 sing</p>
<p class="calibre1">'Annie	 Laurie,'	 or	 any	 other	 sweet,	 low	 song?	 Let	 us	 get	 into	 genial,	 receptive mood.	 Miller,	 you	 and	 your	 fellow-doubters	 please	 retire	 to	 the	 far	 end	 of	 the room." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	a	voice	that	trembled	a	little,	Mrs.	Harris	started	the	dear	old	melody,	and	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">joined	in,	producing	a	soft	and	lulling	chorus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	end	of	the	song	I	asked,	matter-of-factly:	"Are	the	conditions	right?	Are</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	sitting	right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Quigg	sharply	queried,	"Whom	are	you	talking	to?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	'guides,'"	I	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	'guides'!"	she	exclaimed.	"Do	you	believe	in	the	guides?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 believe	 in	 the	  <i class="calibre4">belief</i>	 of	 the	 guides,"	 was	 my	 cryptic	 rejoinder.	 "Sing	 again, please." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	really	had	no	faith	in	the	conditions	of	the	circle,	but	for	the	joke	of	it	I	kept	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">sitters	in	place	for	nearly	an	hour	by	dint	of	pretending	to	hear	creakings	and	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">feel	throbbings,	until	at	last	little	Miss	Brush	became	very	deeply	concerned.	"I</p>
<p class="calibre1">feel	 them,	 too,"	 she	 declared.	 "Did	 some	 one	 blow	 on	 my	 hands?	 I	 felt	 a	 cold</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>wave." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harris	 got	 up	 abruptly.	 "I'll	 join	 the	 doubters,"	 said	 he.	 "This	 tomfoolery	 is	 too idiotic	for	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cameron	 followed,	 and	 Mrs.	 Quigg	 also	 rose.	 "I'll	 go	 with	 you,"	 she	 said, decidedly.	 I	 was	 willing	 to	 quit,	 too,	 but	 Mrs.	 Harris	 and	 Miss	 Brush	 pleaded with	me	to	continue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Close	up	the	circle,	then.	Probably	Harris	was	the	hoodoo.	Things	will	happen</p>
<p class="calibre1">now,"	I	said,	briskly,	though	still	without	any	faith	in	the	experiment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hardly	 had	 Harris	 left	 the	 table	 when	 a	 shudder	 passed	 over	 Mrs.	 Harris,	 her head	lifted,	and	her	eyes	closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's	the	matter,	Dolly?"	whispered	Mrs.	Cameron.	"Do	you	feel	faint?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	be	alarmed!	Mrs.	Harris	is	only	passing	into	a	sleep.	Not	a	word,	Harris!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	warningly.	"Please	move	farther	away." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 dusky	 light	 the	 faces	 of	 all	 the	 women	 looked	 suddenly	 blanched	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">strange	as	the	entranced	woman	seized	upon	the	table	with	her	hands,	shaking	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">hard	 from	 side	 to	 side.	 The	 table	 seemed	 to	 wake	 to	 diabolic	 energy	 under	 her palms.	 This	 was	 an	 unexpected	 development,	 and	 I	 was	 almost	 as	 much</p>
<p class="calibre1">surprised	as	the	others	were. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sing	again,"	I	commanded,	softly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 they	 sang,	 Mrs.	 Harris	 withdrew	 her	 hands	 from	 the	 table	 and	 sat	 rigidly erect,	 yet	 with	 a	 peaceful	 look	 upon	 her	 face.	 "She	 does	 it	 well,"	 I	 thought.	 "I didn't	 think	 it	 in	 the	 quiet	 little	 lady."	 At	 length	 one	 hand	 lifted	 and	 dropped limply	 upon	 the	 table.	 "It	 wants	 to	 write,"	 said	 I.	 "Where	 is	 the	 pad?	 I	 have	 a pencil." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	put	a	pencil	under	the	hand,	it	was	seized	in	a	very	singular	way,	and	almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">instantly	Mrs.	Cameron	gasped,	"That's	very	strange!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hush!"	said	I.	"Wait!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holding	the	pencil	clumsily	as	a	crippled	person	might	do,	the	hand	crept	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 paper,	 and	 at	 last,	 after	 writing	 several	 lines,	 stopped	 and	 lay	 laxly	 open.	 I passed	the	pad	to	Brierly.	"Read	it	aloud,"	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>He	took	it	to	the	light	and	read:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sara,	 be	 not	 sceptical.	 Believe	 and	 you	 will	 be	 happier.	 Life	 is	 only	 the minutest	segment	of	the	great	circle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">MARTIN." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My	father!"	exclaimed	Mrs.	Cameron.	"Let	me	see	the	writing."	Brierly	handed the	pad	to	her.	She	stared	upon	it	in	awe	and	wonder.	"It	is	his	exact	signature—</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 Dolly	 held	 the	 pen	 just	 as	 he	 did—he	 was	 paralyzed	 toward	 the	 last—and</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	only	write	by	holding	his	pen	that	way." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Look!	it's	moving	again,"	I	exclaimed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	hand	caught	up	the	pencil,	and,	holding	it	between	the	thumb	and	forefinger</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	a	peculiar	way,	began	moving	it	in	the	air.	Brierly,	who	sat	opposite,	translated</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	 movements.	 "She	 is	 drawing,	 free-hand,	 in	 the	 air.	 She	 is	 sketching	 the outline	 of	 a	 boat.	 See	 how	 she	 measures	 and	 plumbs	 her	 lines!	 Are	 you</p>
<p class="calibre1">addressing	me?"	he	asked	of	Mrs.	Harris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sleeper	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can't	you	write?"	I	asked.	"Can't	you	speak?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 low	 gurgle	 in	 the	 throat	 was	 the	 only	 answer	 at	 the	 moment,	 but	 after	 a	 few trials	 a	 husky	 whisper	 began	 to	 be	 heard.	 "I	 will	 try,"	 she	 said,	 and	 suddenly began	to	chuckle,	rolling	upon	one	hip	and	throwing	one	foot	over	the	other	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	man	taking	an	easy	attitude.	She	now	held	the	pencil	as	if	it	were	a	cigarette, </p>
<p class="calibre1">laughing	again	with	such	generous	tone	that	the	other	women	recoiled.	Then	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">spoke,	huskily.	"You	know—San	Remo—Sands,"	came	brokenly	from	her	lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sands?"	queried	the	painter;	"who	is	Sands?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sands—San	Remo—boats." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	painter	was	puzzled.	"I	don't	remember	any	Sands	at	San	Remo.	It	must	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	student	I	knew	in	Paris.	Is	that	what	you	mean?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	 Harris	 violently	 nodded.	 As	 abruptly	 as	 it	 came,	 this	 action	 left	 her,	 and then	slowly,	imperceptibly,	her	expression	changed,	a	look	of	ineffable	maternal</p>
<p class="calibre1">sweetness	came	into	her	face;	she	seemed	to	cradle	a	tiny	babe	upon	her	arm.	At</p>
<p class="calibre1">last	she	sighed,	"Oh,	the	pity	of	it,	the	pity	of	it!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>For	a	minute	we	sat	in	silence,	so	compelling	were	her	gestures	and	her	tone.	At last	I	asked,	"Has	any	one	here	lost	a	little	child?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Cameron	spoke,	hesitatingly,	"Yes—I	lost	a	little	baby—years	ago." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	is	addressing	you—perhaps." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	 Harris	 did	 not	 respond	 to	 this	 suggestion,	 but	 changed	 into	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">impersonation	 of	 a	 rollicking	 girl	 of	 rather	 common	 fibre.	 "Hello,	 Sally!"	 she cried	 out,	 and	 Mrs.	 Cameron	 stared	 at	 her	 in	 blank	 dismay	 as	 she	 asked,	 "Are you	talking	to	me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	bet	I	am,	you	old	bag	o'	wool.	Remember	Geny?	Remember	the	night	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	door-step?	Ooo!	but	it	was	cold!  <i class="calibre4">You</i>	were	to	blame." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	is	she	talking	about?"	I	asked,	seeing	that	Mrs.	Cameron	was	reluctant	to answer	this	challenge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	seems	to	be	impersonating	an	old	class-mate	of	mine	at	college—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	what!"	broke	in	the	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Cameron	went	on,	"Her	name	was	Eugenia	Hull—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	 yet,"	 laughed	 the	 voice.	 "Same	 old	 sport.	 Couldn't	 find	 any	 man	 good enough.	You	didn't	like	me,	but	no	matter;	I	want	to	tell	you	that	you're	in	danger</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	fire.	Don't	play	with	fire.	Be	careful	of	fire—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again	 a	 calm	 blankness	 fell	 upon	 the	 psychic's	 delicate	 and	 sensitive	 face,	 and the	hand	once	more	slowly	closed	upon	the	pencil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My	 father	 again!"	 exclaimed	 Mrs.	 Cameron.	 "How	 could	 Dolly	 have	 known that	he	held	his	pen	in	just	that	way?	She	never	saw	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	 not	 place	 too	 much	 value	 on	 such	 performances,"	 I	 cautioned.	 "She	 has probably	 heard	 you	 describe	 it.	 Or	 she	 might	 have	 taken	 it	 out	 of	 your</p>
<p class="calibre1">subconscious	mind." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 pencil	 dropped.	 The	 hand	 lifted.	 The	 form	 of	 the	 sleeper	 expanded	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">power.	 Her	 face	 took	 on	 benignity	 and	 lofty	 serenity.	 She	 rose	 slowly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">impressively,	 and	 with	 her	 hand	 upraised	 in	 a	 peculiar	 gesture,	 laid	 a	 blessing upon	the	head	of	her	hostess.	There	was	so	much	of	sweetness	and	tolerance	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	face,	so	much	of	dignity	and	power	in	every	movement	that	I	was	moved	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>applaud	 the	 actress.	 As	 we	 all	 sat	 thus,	 deeply	 impressed	 by	 her	 towering attitude,	Mrs.	Cameron	whispered:	"Why,	it	is	Bishop	Blank!	That	is	exactly	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	he	held	his	hand—his	robe!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	it	the	bishop?"	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 psychic	 bowed	 and	 in	 solemn	 answer	 spoke.	 "Tell	 James	 all	 will	 yet	 be well,"	she	said,	and,	making	the	sign	of	blessing	once	more,	sank	back	into	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile	the	irreverent	ribalds	in	the	far	end	of	the	room	were	disturbing	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">solemnity	of	all	this	communion	with	the	shades,	and	at	my	suggestion	we	went</p>
<p class="calibre1">up-stairs	to	Mrs.	Cameron's	own	sitting-room,	where	we	could	be	quiet.	Seizing</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	moment	when	Mrs.	Harris	was	free	from	the	"influence,"	I	woke	her	and	told</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	what	we	were	about	to	do.	She	followed	Mrs.	Cameron	readily,	although	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	a	little	dazed,	and	five	of	us	continued	the	sitting,	with	Mrs.	Quigg	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cameron	 looking	 on	 with	 perfectly	 evident	 doubt	 of	 our	 psychic's	 sincerity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harris	was	rigidly	excluded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	quiet	of	this	room	Mrs.	Harris	passed	almost	immediately	into	trance—or</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	seemed	like	a	trance—and	ran	swiftly	over	all	her	former	impersonations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voice	succeeded	voice,	almost	without	pause.	The	sweet	mother	with	the	child, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 painter	 of	 San	 Remo,	 the	 jovial	 and	 slangy	 girl,	 the	 commanding	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">majestic	 figure	 of	 the	 bishop—all	 returned	 repeatedly,	 in	 bewildering	 mixture, </p>
<p class="calibre1">dropping	away,	one	after	the	other,	with	disappointing	suddenness.	And	yet	each</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	the	messages	grew	a	little	more	definite,	a	little	more	coherent,	until	at	last</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 all	 cleared	 up,	 and	 this	  <i class="calibre4">in	 opposition	 to	 our	 thought,	 to	 our	 first</i> <i class="calibre4">interpretations</i>.	 It	 developed	 that	 the	 painter	 was	 not	 named	 "Sands,"	 but</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Felipi,"	 and	 that	 he	 was	 only	 trying	 to	 tell	 Brierly	 that	 to	 succeed	 he	 should paint	rocks	and	sands	and	old	boats	at	San	Remo.	"Pauline,"	the	woman	who	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	 to	 hold	 a	 babe,	 was	 a	 friend	 of	 Mrs.	 Cameron's	 who	 had	 died	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">childbirth.	And	then	swiftly,	unaccountably,	all	these	gentle	or	genial	influences</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 scattered	 as	 if	 by	 something	 hellish,	 something	 diabolic.	 The	 face	 of	 the sweet	 little	 woman	 became	 fiendish	 in	 line.	 Her	 lips	 snarled,	 her	 hands	 clawed like	 those	 of	 a	 cat,	 and	 out	 of	 her	 mouth	 came	 a	 hoarse	 imprecation.	 "I'll	 tear your	heart	out!"	she	snarled.	"I'll	kill	you	soul	and	body—I'll	rip	you	limb	from limb!"	 We	 all	 recoiled	 in	 amazement	 and	 wonder.	 It	 was	 as	 if	 our	 friend	 had suddenly	gone	insane. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 confess	 to	 a	 feeling	 of	 profound	 astonishment.	 I	 had	 never	 met	 Mrs.	 Harris</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>before,	but	as	she	was	an	intimate	friend	of	Mrs.	Cameron,	and	quite	evidently	a woman	of	culture,	I	could	not	think	her	so	practised	a	joker	as	to	be	"putting	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	on." </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	 still	 we	 sat	 in	 silence,	 another	 voice	 uttered	 a	 wail	 of	 infinite	 terror	 and despair.	"I	didn't	do	it!  <i class="calibre4">Don't</i>	kill	me!	It	was	not	 <i class="calibre4">my</i>	work."	And	then,	still	more horrible	to	hear,	a	sound	like	the	gurgling	of	blood	came	from	the	psychic's	lips, </p>
<p class="calibre1">mixed	 with	 babbled,	 frantic,	 incoherent	 words.	 I	 had	 a	 perfectly	 definite</p>
<p class="calibre1">impression	 that	 she	 was	 impersonating	 some	 one	 with	 his	 throat	 cut.	 Her</p>
<p class="calibre1">grimaces	were	disgusting	and	terrifying.	The	women	shivered	with	horror.	A	few</p>
<p class="calibre1">seconds	later	and	her	face	changed;	the	hideous	mask	became	white,	expressing</p>
<p class="calibre1">rigid,	exalted	terror.	Her	arms	were	drawn	back	as	if	tied	at	the	elbow	behind	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">back.	 Her	 head	 was	 uplifted,	 and	 in	 a	 low,	 monotonous,	 hushed	 voice	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1">prayed:	"Lord	Jesus,	receive—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 gasping,	 gurgling	 cry	 cut	 short	 her	 prayer,	 and,	 with	 tongue	 protruding	 from her	 mouth,	 she	 presented	 such	 a	 picture	 of	 a	 strangling	 woman	 that	 a	 sudden clear	conception	of	what	it	all	meant	came	to	me.	"She's	impersonating	a	woman</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 the	 scaffold,"	 I	 explained.	 "She	 has	 shown	 us	 a	 murder,	 and	 now	 she	 is depicting	an	execution.	Is	it	Mrs.	R.,	of	Vermont?"	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded	slowly.	"Save	me!"	she	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Waken	her,	please.	Don't	let	her	do	that	any	more,"	pleaded	Mrs.	Cameron,	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">poignant	distress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thereupon	I	called	out,	sharply:	"That	is	enough!	Wake!  <i class="calibre4">Wake! </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	answer	to	my	command	she	ceased	to	groan;	her	face	smoothed	out,	and	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 bewildered	 smile	 she	 opened	 her	 eyes.	 "What	 are	 you	 saying?	 Have	 I	 been asleep?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	 have,	 indeed,"	 I	 replied,	 "and	 you've	 disclosed	 a	 deal	 of	 dubious	 family history.	How	do	you	feel?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 feel	 very	 funny	 around	 my	 neck,"	 she	 answered,	 wonderingly.	 "What	 have you	been	doing	to	me?"	She	rubbed	her	throat.	"My	neck	feels	as	if	it	had	a	band round	it,	and	my	tongue	seems	swollen.	What	have	you	been	about?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	held	up	a	warning	hand	to	the	others.	"You	went	off	into	a	quiet	little	trance, </p>
<p class="calibre1">that's	all.	I	was	mistaken.	Either	you	are	a	psychic	or	you	should	have	been	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">actress." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>As	 we	 stood	 thus	 confronting	 one	 another,	 Mrs.	 Cameron	 came	 between	 us, saying,	"Do	you	know,	Pauline	came	and	talked	with	me—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	word	 <i class="calibre4">Pauline</i>	the	spell	seemed	to	fall	again	over	the	bright	spirit	of	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harris.	 Her	 eyelids	 drooped,	 her	 limbs	 lost	 their	 power,	 and	 she	 sank	 into	 her chair	as	before,	a	helpless	victim,	apparently,	to	the	hidden	forces.	For	a	moment</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	at	a	loss.	I	could	not	believe	that	she	was	deceiving	us,	but	it	was	possible</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	she	was	deceiving	herself.	"In	either	case,	she	must	be	brought	out	of	this,"	I decided,	and,	putting	my	hands	on	her	shoulders,	I	said:	"If	there	is	any	'control' </p>
<p class="calibre1">here,	let	them	stop	this.	We	want	no	more	of	it.	Stop	it!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 command	 was	 again	 obeyed,	 and	 the	 psychic	 slowly	 came	 back	 to	 herself, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	as	she	did	so	I	said,	warningly,	to	Mrs.	Cameron:	"Do	not	utter	another	word</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	this	in	Mrs.	Harris's	presence.	She	seems	to	be	extremely	sensitive	to	hypnotic</p>
<p class="calibre1">influence,	and	I	think	she	had	better	go	out	into	the	air	at	once." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 rather	 subdued	 mood	 we	 went	 below	 to	 rejoin	 the	 frankly	 contemptuous</p>
<p class="calibre1">members	of	the	party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	what	luck?"	cried	Howard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	all	look	rather	solemn,"	said	Harris.	"What	about	it?	Dolly,	what	have	you been	doing?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	 Cameron	 described	 the	 sitting	 as	 wonderful,	 but	 Mrs.	 Harris	 only	 smiled</p>
<p class="calibre1">vaguely,	 and	 I	 said:	 "Your	 wife	 seemed	 to	 go	 into	 a	 trance	 and	 impersonate	 a number	of	individuals.	She	shows	all	the	signs	of	a	real	sensitive." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harris,	who	had	been	studying	his	wife	with	half-humorous	intentness,	now	took</p>
<p class="calibre1">command.	 "If	 you've	 been	 shamming,	 you	 need	 discipline;	 and	 if	 you	 haven't, you	need	a	doctor.	I	think	we'll	go	home	and	have	it	out,"	he	added,	and	shortly</p>
<p class="calibre1">after	led	her	away.	"Some	nice	cool	air	is	what	we	need,"	he	said	at	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	 sooner	 were	 the	 Harrises	 out	 of	 the	 door	 than	 the	 women	 of	 the	 party	 fell upon	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	do	you	think	of	it,	Mr.	Garland?"	asked	Mrs.	Cameron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	Mrs.	Harris	were	not	your	friend,	and	if	I	had	not	seen	other	performances	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	same	sort,	I	should	instantly	say	that	she	was	having	her	joke	with	us.	But	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 seen	 too	 much	 of	 this	 sort	 of	 thing	 to	 take	 it	 altogether	 lightly.	 That's	 the way	 this	 investigating	 goes.	 One	 thing	 corroborates	 another.	 'Impersonation'	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>the	 case	 of	 a	 public	 medium	 may	 mean	 nothing—on	 the	 part	 of	 a	 psychic	 like your	friend	Mrs.	Harris	it	means	a	very	great	deal.	In	support	of	this,	let	me	tell</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	 of	 a	 similar	 case.	 I	 have	 a	 friend,	 a	 perfectly	 trustworthy	 woman,	 and	 of keen	 intelligence,	 whose	 'stunt,'	 as	 she	 laughingly	 calls	 it,	 is	 to	 impersonate nameless	 and	 suffering	 spirits	 who	 have	 been	 hurled	 into	 outer	 darkness	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1">reason	of	their	own	misdeeds	or	by	some	singular	chance	of	their	taking	off.	My</p>
<p class="calibre1">friend	 seems	 to	 be	 able	 in	 some	 way	 to	 free	 these	 poor	 'earth-bound	 souls'	 and send	 them	 flying	 upward	 to	 some	 heaven.	 It's	 all	 very	 creepy,"	 I	 added, warningly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	delightful!	Let	it	be	 <i class="calibre4">very</i>	creepy,"	called	Mrs.	Quigg. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"To	begin	with,	my	friend	is	as	keen-eyed,	as	level-headed	as	any	woman	I	know</p>
<p class="calibre1">—the	last	person	in	the	world	to	be	taken	for	a	'sensitive.'	I	had	never	suspected</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	in	her;	but	one	night	she	laughingly	admitted	having	been	'in	the	work'	at	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">time,	and	I	begged	for	a	sitting.	We	were	dining	at	her	house—Jack	Ross,	a	Miss</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wilcox,	and	I,	all	intimate	friends	of	hers,	and	she	consented.	After	sitting	a	few</p>
<p class="calibre1">minutes	she	turned	to	me	and	said:	'My	"guide"	is	here.	Be	sure	to	keep	near	me; don't	let	me	fall.'	She	still	spoke	smilingly,	but	I	could	see	she	was	in	earnest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'You	 see,'	 she	 explained,	 'I	 seem	 to	 leave	 the	 body	 and	 to	 withdraw	 a	 little distance	 above	 my	 chair.	 From	 this	 height	 I	 survey	 my	 material	 self,	 which</p>
<p class="calibre1">seems	 to	 be	 animated	 by	 an	 entirely	 alien	 influence.	 Sometimes	 my	 body	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">moved	 by	 these	 forces	 to	 rise	 and	 walk	 about	 the	 room.	 In	 such	 cases	 it	 is necessary	 for	 some	 friend	 to	 follow	 close	 behind	 me,	 for	 between	 the	 going	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">"the	 spirit"	 and	 the	 return	 of	 my	 "astral	 self"	 there	 lies	 an	 appreciable	 interval when	my	body	is	as	limp	as	an	empty	sack.	I	came	very	near	having	a	bad	fall</p>
<p class="calibre1">once.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'I	understand,'	said	I.	'I'll	keep	an	eye	on	you.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In	 a	 few	 moments	 a	 change	 came	 over	 her	 face.	 She	 sank	 into	 a	 curious negative	state	between	trance	and	reverie.	Her	lips	parted,	and	a	soft	voice	came</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	them.	She	spoke	to	Miss	Wilcox,	who	sat	opposite	her:	'Sister—I	am	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">happy.	 I	 am	 surrounded	 by	 children.	 It	 is	 beautiful	 here	 in	 the	 happy	 valley—</p>
<p class="calibre1">warm	and	golden—and	oh,	the	merry	children!' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Miss	 Wilcox	 was	 deeply	 moved	 by	 this	 message	 and	 for	 a	 moment	 could	 not reply.	At	length	she	recovered	her	voice	and	asked,	'Are	you	speaking	to	me?' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Yes.	I	am	worried	about	mother.	She	is	sick.	Go	to	her.	She	needs	help.	Good-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>bye!'	The	smile	faded;	my	friend's	face	resumed	its	impersonal	calm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Did	you	recognize	the	spirit?'	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Miss	 Wilcox	 hesitated,	 but	 at	 last	 said:	 'My	 sister	 was	 active	 in	 the	 work	 of caring	for	orphan	children.	But	that	proves	nothing.	Anna	may	have	known	it—</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	is	no	test	in	this.	It	may	be	only	mind-reading.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'You	are	quite	right,'	I	replied.	'But	the	message	concerning	your	mother	can	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">tested,	can	it	not?' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"At	 this	 moment	 the	 face	 of	 the	 psychic	 squared,	 and	 a	 deep,	 slow	 voice	 came pulsing	 forth.	 'Why	 do	 you	 wilfully	 blind	 your	 eyes?	 The	 truth	 will	 prevail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mystery	is	all	about	you.	Why	doubt	that	which	would	comfort	you?' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Who	are	you?'	I	inquired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'I	am	Theodore	Parker,	the	psychic's	control,'	was	the	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Soon	 after	 this	 my	 friend	 opened	 her	 eyes	 and	 smiled.	 'Do	 you	 know	 what you've	said?'	I	asked.	'Yes,	I	always	have	a	dim	notion	of	what	is	going	on,'	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">answered,	'but	why	I	am	moved	to	speak	and	act	as	I	do	I	don't	know.	It	is	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 same	 when	 I	 write	 automatically.	 I	 know	 when	 I	 do	 it,	 but	 I	 can't	 see	 the connection	 between	 my	 own	 mind	 and	 the	 writing.	 It	 is	 as	 if	 one	 lobe	 of	 my brain	kept	watch	over	the	action	of	the	other.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	 now	 passed	 into	 another	 period	 of	 immobility	 and	 so	 sat	 for	 a	 long	 time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly	 her	 face	 hardened,	 became	 coarse,	 common,	 vicious	 in	 line.	 Flinging</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	 her	 hand,	 she	 struck	 me	 in	 the	 breast.	 'What	 do	 you	 want	 of	 me?'	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1">demanded,	in	the	voice	of	a	harridan.	'What	are	you	all	doing	here?	You're	a	nice</p>
<p class="calibre1">lot	of	fools.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Who	are	you?'	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'You	know	who	I	am,'	she	answered,	with	a	hoarse	laugh.	'A	sweet	bunch	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">are!	Where's	Jim?' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Does	any	one	recognize	this	"party"?'	I	asked.	'Ross,	this	must	be	one	of	your set.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ross	 laughed,	 and	 the	 'influence,'	 thrusting	 her	 face	 close	 to	 his,	 blurted	 out, menacingly:	'Don't	know	me,	hey?	Well,	here	I	am.	I	wanted	a	show,	and	they	let</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	in.	What	you	going	to	do	about	it?' </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>"'I	 reckon	 you	 lit	 in	 the	 wrong	 door-yard,'	 I	 replied;	 'nobody	 knows	 you	 here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Skiddoo!' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	made	an	ugly	face	at	me,	and	struck	at	me	with	her	claw-like	hand.	'I'd	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	smash	you!' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Good-bye,'	said	I.	'Get	out!'	And	she	was	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Before	 a	 word	 could	 be	 spoken,	 a	 look	 of	 hopeless,	 heart-piercing	 woe	 came over	 my	 friend's	 face.	 She	 began	 to	 moan	 and	 wring	 her	 hands	 most	 piteously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Oh,	 where	 am	 I?'	 she	 wailed.	 'It	 is	 so	 cold,	 so	 cold!	 So	 cold	 and	 dark!	 Won't somebody	help	me?	Oh,	help	me!' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	gently	asked:	'Who	are	you?	Can't	you	tell	us	your	name?' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Oh,	I	don't	know,	I	can't	tell,'	moaned	the	voice.	'It's	all	so	dark	and	cold	and lonely.	Please	tell	me	where	I	am.	I've	lost	my	name.	All	is	so	dark	and	cold.	Oh, </p>
<p class="calibre1">pity	me!	Let	me	come	in.	Let	me	feel	your	light.	I'm	freezing!	Oh,	pity	me.	I'm</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	lonely.	It's	so	dark.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Come	in,'	I	said.	'We	will	help	you.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 hands	 of	 the	 psychic	 crept	 timidly	 up	 my	 arm	 and	 touched	 my	 cheek. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Thank	 you!	 Thank	 you!	 Oh,	 the	 cheer!	 Oh,	 the	 light!'	 she	 cried,	 ecstatically.	 'I see!	I	know!	Good-bye!'	And	with	a	sigh	of	ecstasy	the	voice	ceased. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	can	hardly	express	to	you	the	vivid	and	yet	sombre	impression	this	made	upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">me.	 It	 was	 as	 if	 a	 chilled	 and	 weary	 bird,	 having	 winged	 its	 way	 from	 the winter's	 midnight	 into	 a	 warm	 room,	 had	 been	 heartened	 and	 invigorated,	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">rushed	away	confident	and	swift	to	the	sun-lands	of	the	South. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"One	 by	 one	 other	 'earth-bound	 souls'	 who,	 from	 one	 cause	 or	 another,	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">'unable	 to	 find	 their	 way	 upward,'	 came	 into	 our	 ken	 like	 chilled	 and	 desperate bats	condemned	to	whirl	in	endless	outer	darkness	and	silence—poor,	abortive, </p>
<p class="calibre1">anomalous	 shadows,	 whose	 voices	 pleaded	 piteously	 for	 release.	 Nameless, </p>
<p class="calibre1">agonized,	bewildered,	they	clung	like	moths	to	the	light	of	our	psychic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Some	of	them	appeared	to	be	suffering	all	the	terrors	of	the	damned,	and	as	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">moaned	and	pleaded	for	light,	the	lovely	face	of	my	friend	was	convulsed	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">agony	 and	 her	 hands	 fluttered	 about	 like	 wounded	 birds.	 Singular	 conception! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wonderful	power	of	suggestion! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>"At	 length,	 with	 a	 glad	 cry,	 the	 last	 of	 these	 blind	 souls	 saw,	 sighed	 with happiness,	and	seemed	to	vanish	upward,	as	if	into	some	unfathomable,	fourth-dimension	heaven.	Then	the	sweet	first	spirit,	the	woman	with	the	glad	children, </p>
<p class="calibre1">returned	to	say	to	Miss	Wilcox,	'Be	happy—George	 <i class="calibre4">is</i>	coming	back	to	you.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"After	 she	 passed,	 my	 friend	 opened	 her	 eyes	 as	 before,	 clearly,	 smilingly,	 and said,	'Have	you	had	enough?' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Plenty,'	said	I.	'You	nearly	took	my	eye	out	in	your	dramatic	fervor.	I	must	say</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	ghosts	are	most	unhappy	creatures.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	became	very	serious.	'Please	don't	think	that	these	spirits	are	my	affinities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	work	is	purely	philanthropic,	so	Theodore	Parker	used	to	tell	mother.	It	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	duty,	he	said,	to	comfort	the	cheerless,	to	liberate	the	earth-bound,	and	so	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	to	have	these	poor	creatures	waiting	around.	That's	why	I	gave	it	up.	It	got	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 too	 dreadful.	 We	 never	 could	 tell	 what	 would	 come	 next.	 Murderers	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">barnburners	and	every	other	accursed	spirit	seemed	to	be	privileged	to	come	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 poor	 empty	 house	 and	 abuse	 it,	 although	 Parker	 and	 his	 band	 promised	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">protect	 me.	 I	 stopped	 it.	 I	 will	 not	 sit	 again,'	 she	 said,	 firmly.	 'I	 don't	 like	 it.	 It would	be	bad	enough	to	be	dominated	by	one's	dead	friends,	or	the	dead	friends</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 one's	 friends,	 but	 to	 be	 helpless	 in	 the	 hands	 of	 all	 the	 demons	 and	 suicides and	miscreants	of	the	other	world	is	intolerable.	And	if	I	am	not	dominated	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">dead	people,	I	fear	I	am	acting	in	response	to	the	minds	of	vicious	living	people, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I	don't	like	that.	It's	a	dreadful	feeling—can't	you	see	it	is?—this	being	open</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 every	 wandering	 gust	 of	 passion.	 I	 wouldn't	 let	 any	 one	 of	 my	 children	 be controlled	 for	 the	 world.	 Don't	 ask	 me	 to	 sit	 again,	 and	 please	 don't	 let	 my friends	know	of	my	"gift."' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	course	we	promised,	but	the	effect	of	that	sitting	I	shall	not	soon	forget.	By-</p>
<p class="calibre1">the-way,	Miss	Wilcox	'phoned	and	proved	the	truth	of	her	message.	Her	mother</p>
<p class="calibre1">really	was	ill	and	in	need	of	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	closed	this	story,	Cameron	said:	"Garland,	you	tell	that	as	if	you	believed	in it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	certainly	do	believe	in	my	friend.	It's	no	joke	with	her.	She	is	quite	certain	that she	 is	 controlled	 by	 those	 'on	 the	 other	 side,'	 and	 that	 to	 submit	 is	 to	 lose	 so much	 of	 her	 own	 individuality.	 You	 may	 call	 it	 hysteria,	 somnambulism, </p>
<p class="calibre1">hypnotism,	anything	you	like,	but	that	certain	people	are	moved	subconsciously</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	impersonate	the	dead	I	am	quite	ready	to	believe.	However,	'impersonation'	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	least	convincing	(from	my	point	of	view)	of	all	the	phases	of	mediumship.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>have	 paid	 very	 little	 attention	 to	 it	 in	 the	 course	 of	 my	 investigation.	 It	 has	 no value	 as	 evidence.	 You	 are	 still	 in	 the	 tattered	 fringes	 of	 'spiritism,'	 even	 when you	have	seen	all	that	impersonation	can	show	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	what	do	you	suggest	as	the	proper	method	for	the	society?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As	 I	 told	 you	 at	 beginning,	 I	 have	 had	 a	 great	 deal	 of	 experience	 with	 these elusive	 'facts,'	 and	 it	 chances	 that	 a	 practised	 though	 non-professional	 psychic with	 whom	 I	 have	 held	 many	 baffling	 sittings,	 is	 in	 the	 city.	 I	 may	 be	 able	 to induce	her	to	sit	for	us." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	do,	do!"	cried	Mrs.	Cameron	and	Miss	Brush	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who	is	she?"	asked	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	 tell	 you	 more	 about	 her—next	 time,"	 I	 said,	 tantalizingly.	 "She	 is	 very puzzling,	I	assure	you.	When	and	where	shall	we	meet?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Here,"	said	Cameron,	promptly.	"I'm	getting	interested.	Bring	on	your	marvels." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,"	said	Miller,	and	his	mouth	shut	like	a	steel	trap.	"Bring	on	your	faker.	It won't	take	us	long	to	expose	her	little	game." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bigger	 scientific	 bigots	 than	 you	 have	 been	 conquered,"	 I	 retorted.	 "All	 right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'll	see	what	I	can	do.	We'll	meet	one	week	from	to-day." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,"	said	Cameron;	"come	for	dinner." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	was	going	out,	Mrs.	Quigg	detained	me.	"If	it	had	been	anybody	but	nice</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	Mrs.	Harris,	I	should	say	that	you	had	made	this	all	up	between	you.	As	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">is,	I	guess	I'll	have	to	admit	that	there	is	something	in	thought	transference	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">hypnotism.  <i class="calibre4">You	were	her	control. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	will	serve	for	one	evening,"	I	retorted.	"I'll	make	you	doubt	the	existence of	matter	before	we	finish	this	series	of	sittings."	And	with	this	we	parted. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a><b class="calibre3">II</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	a	little	late	at	Cameron's	dinner-party,	and	no	sooner	had	I	shown	my	face</p>
<p class="calibre1">inside	the	door	than	a	chorus	of	excited	inquiry	arose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where	is	the	medium?"	demanded	Cameron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	tell	us	you	haven't	got	her!"	exclaimed	Mrs.	Quigg. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 haven't	 her	 in	 my	 pocket,	 but	 she	 has	 promised	 to	 appear	 a	 little	 later,"	 I replied,	serenely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why	didn't	you	bring	her	to	dinner?"	asked	Mrs.	Cameron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	she	seemed	a	little	shy,	and,	besides,	I	was	quite	sure	you	would	all	want</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	discuss	her,	and	so—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	do	tell	us	about	her.	Who	is	she?	Does	she	perform	for	a	living?	What	kind</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	a	person	are	we	to	expect?"	volleyed	Miss	Brush. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	this	I	replied:	"She	is	a	native	of	the	Middle	West—Ohio,	I	believe.	No,	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">does	not	do	this	for	a	living;	in	fact,	she	makes	no	charge	for	her	services.	She	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	 gentle	 and	 lady-like,	 and	 much	 interested,	 naturally,	 in	 converting	 you	 to spiritualism;	 for,	 like	 most	 psychics,	 she	 believes	 in	 spirits.	 She	 says	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">'controls'	have	especially	urged	her	to	give	me	sittings.	I	am	highly	flattered	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">think	 the	 spirit	 folk	 should	 consider	 me	 so	 particularly	 valuable	 to	 their	 cause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seriously,	I	hope	you	will	appreciate	the	wonderful	concessions	Mrs.	Smiley	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">making	 in	 thus	 putting	 herself	 into	 our	 hands	 with	 the	 almost	 certain	 result	 of being	discredited	by	some	of	us.	I	believe	she	really	is	doing	it	from	a	sense	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">duty,	and	is	entitled	to	be	treated	fairly." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Has	she	been	in	the	business	long?"	asked	Mrs.	Quigg,	with	lurking	sarcasm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ever	since	she	was	about	ten	years	old,	I	believe,	but	she	sits	only	'to	spread	the glad	tidings.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	she	married?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	 and	 has	 a	 devoted	 husband,	 and	 a	 nice	 little	 American	 village	 home.	 I know,	 for	 she	 sent	 me	 a	 photograph	 of	 it.	 She	 has	 two	 children	 'in	 the	 other</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>world.'	Please	don't	think	all	mediums	the	ignorant	and	vicious	harpies	which	the newspapers	 make	 them	 out	 to	 be.	 I	 know	 several	 who	 are	 very	 nice,	 serious-minded	women." </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	this	point	dinner	was	announced,	and	the	dining-room	became	the	field	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">hot	verbal	warfare.	The	members	of	the	society	were	all	present	excepting	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harris,	 who	 had	 been	 greatly	 upset	 by	 her	 own	 performance.	 Bart	 Brierly,	 the painter,	 was	 there	 to	 defend	 the	 mystery	 of	 life	 against	 our	 scientific	 friend Miller,	whose	conception	of	the	 universe	 was	 very	 definite	 indeed.	 Mrs.	 Quigg</p>
<p class="calibre1">supported	 Miller.	 Young	 Howard	 was	 everywhere	 in	 the	 lists,	 and	 his	 raillery</p>
<p class="calibre1">afforded	Cameron	a	great	deal	of	amusement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	contented	myself	with	listening	for	the	first	half-hour,	but	at	last	took	occasion</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 say	 to	 Miller:	 "Like	 all	 violent	 opponents	 of	 the	 metapsychical,	 you	 know very	little	of	the	subject	you	are	discussing.	To	sustain	this	contention,	let	me	ask</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	 you	 have	 ever	 read	 the	 account	 of	 Sir	 William	 Crookes's	 experiments	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">psychic	force?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller	confessed	that	he	had	not.	"I	have	avoided	doing	so,	for	I	respect	Crookes</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	a	chemist,"	he	added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	continued:	"Crookes	began	by	pooh-poohing	the	whole	subject	of	spiritualism, </p>
<p class="calibre1">very	much	as	you	do,	Miller;	but	after	three	years	of	rigid	investigation,	he	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">forced	to	announce	himself	convinced	of	the	truth	of	many	of	the	so-called	spirit</p>
<p class="calibre1">phenomena.	 It	 is	 instructive	 to	 recall	 that	 when	 he	 was	 willing	 to	 hazard	 his scientific	reputation	on	a	report	of	this	character	to	the	Royal	Society,	of	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	was	a	member,	his	paper	was	thrown	out.	The	secretary	refused	even	to	enter</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	upon	the	files	of	the	institution." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	know	about	that,"	replied	Miller,	"and	I	consider	the	secretary	justified.	To	his thinking,	Crookes	had	lost	his	head." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No	 matter	 what	 he	 thought,"	 I	 replied.	 "Any	 paper	 by	 a	 man	 of	 Crookes's standing,	 with	 his	 knowledge	 of	 chemistry	 and	 of	 life,	 and	 his	 long	 training	 in exact	observation,	should	have	been	considered.	The	action	of	the	secretary	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">due	simply	to	prejudice,	and	many	of	those	who	voted	to	ignore	that	report	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">to-day	more	than	half	convinced	that	Sir	William	has	been	justified.	Each	of	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">experiments	 has	 been	 repeated	 and	 his	 findings	 verified	 by	 scientific	 men	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe.	 It	 is	 a	 pleasure	 to	 add	 that	 our	 own	 Smithsonian	 Institution	 published two	of	his	speculative	papers	some	years	ago.	So	it	goes—the	heresy	of	to-day	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	orthodoxy	of	to-morrow." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>"Didn't	Crookes	afterward	repudiate	that	early	report?"	asked	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"On	 the	 contrary,	 in	 1898,	 upon	 being	 elected	 to	 the	 presidency	 of	 the	 British Association	for	the	Advancement	of	Science,	he	said	(I	think	I	can	recall	almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	exact	words):	'No	incident	in	my	scientific	career	is	more	widely	known	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 part	 I	 took	 in	 certain	 psychic	 researches.	 Thirty	 years	 have	 passed	 since	 I published	an	account	of	experiments	tending	to	show	that	outside	our	scientific</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowledge	 there	 exists	 a	 force	 exercised	 by	 intelligences	 differing	 from	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ordinary	intelligence	common	to	mortals.	This	fact	in	my	life	is	well	understood</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	those	who	honored	me	with	the	invitation	to	become	your	president.	Perhaps</p>
<p class="calibre1">among	my	audience	some	may	feel	curious	as	to	whether	I	shall	speak	out	or	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">silent.	I	elect	to	speak,	although	briefly.	I	have	nothing	to	retract.	I	adhere	to	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">published	statements.	Indeed,	I	might	add	much	thereto.'	And	when	you	realize</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	this	includes	his	astounding	experience	with	'Katie	King,'	his	words	become</p>
<p class="calibre1">tremendous	in	their	significance." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	was	the	'Katie	King'	experience?"	asked	Mrs.	Cameron.	"I	never	heard	of it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	 is	 a	 long	 and	 very	 interesting	 story,	 but	 in	 substance	 it	 is	 this:	 While	 in	 a condition	of	contemptuous	disbelief	as	to	the	alleged	phenomena	of	spiritualism, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	 William	 chanced	 to	 witness	 a	 séance	 wherein	 a	 young	 girl	 named	 Florence</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cook	 was	 the	 medium.	 Her	 doings	 so	 puzzled	 and	 interested	 him	 that	 he	 went</p>
<p class="calibre1">again	 and	 again	 to	 see	 her.	 Dissatisfied	 with	 the	 conditions	 under	 which	 the wonders	 took	 place,	 he	 asked	 Miss	 Cook	 to	 come	 to	 his	 house	 and	 sit	 for	 him and	 his	 friends.	 This	 she	 did.	 She	 was	 a	 mere	 girl	 at	 the	 time,	 about	 seventeen years	 of	 age,	 and	 yet	 she	 baffled	 this	 great	 chemist	 and	 all	 his	 assistants.	 You sometimes	hear	people	say,	'Yes,	but	he	was	in	his	dotage.'	He	was	not.	He	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 his	 early	 prime.	 He	 brought	 to	 bear	 all	 his	 thirty	 years'	 training	 in	 exact observation,	 and	 all	 the	 mechanical	 and	 electrical	 appliances	 he	 could	 devise, without	once	detecting	anything	deceitful." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even	in	the	'Katie	King'	episode?"	asked	Harris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even	Katie	stood	the	test.	But	before	going	into	that,	let	me	tell	you	some	of	his other	 experiments.	 He	 says	 (among	 other	 amazing	 things)	 that	 he	 has	 seen	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">chair	move	on	its	own	account,	without	contact	with	a	medium.	He	saw	Daniel</p>
<p class="calibre1">Home—another	medium	with	whom	he	had	sittings—raised	by	invisible	power</p>
<p class="calibre1">completely	from	the	floor	of	the	room.	'Under	rigid	test	condition,'	he	writes,	'I</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	seen	a	solid,	self-luminous	body	the	size	of	an	egg	float	noiselessly	about</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>the	 room!'	 But	 wait!	 I	 will	 quote	 from	 my	 notes	 his	 exact	 words."	 Here	 I produced	 my	 note-book,	 and	 read	 as	 follows:	 "'I	 have	 seen	 a	 luminous	 cloud floating	upward	toward	a	picture.	Under	the	strictest	test	conditions,	I	have	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	 once	 had	 a	 solid,	 self-luminous,	 crystalline	 body	 placed	 in	 my	 hand	 by	 a hand	which	did	not	belong	to	any	person	in	the	room.  <i class="calibre4">In	the	light</i>,	I	have	seen	a luminous	 cloud	 hover	 over	 a	 heliotrope	 on	 a	 side-table,	 break	 a	 sprig	 off,	 and carry	it	to	a	lady;	and	on	some	occasions	I	have	seen	a	similar	luminous	cloud</p>
<p class="calibre1">condense	to	the	form	of	a	hand	and	carry	small	objects	about.	During	a	séance	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">full	light,	a	beautifully	formed	small	hand	rose	up	from	an	opening	in	a	dining-</p>
<p class="calibre1">table	and	gave	me	a	flower.	This	occurred	in	the	light	in	my	own	room,	while	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	holding	the	medium's	hands	and	feet.	I	have	retained	one	of	these	perfectly</p>
<p class="calibre1">life-like	 and	 graceful	 (spirit)	 hands	 in	 my	 own,	 firmly	 resolved	 not	 to	 let	 it escape,	 but	 it	 gradually	 seemed	 to	 resolve	 itself	 into	 vapor,	 and	 faded	 in	 that manner	from	my	grasp.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	come	now,"	shouted	Howard,	"you're	joking!	Crookes	couldn't	have	written that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 continued	 to	 read:	 "'Under	 satisfactory	 test	 conditions,	 I	 have	 seen	 phantom forms	 and	 faces—a	 phantom	 form	 came	 from	 the	 corner	 of	 the	 room,	 took	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">accordion	in	its	hand,	and	glided	about	the	room	playing	the	instrument.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	paused,	Harris	said:	"Was	all	that	in	his	report	to	the	Royal	Society?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	was." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	 I	 don't	 wonder	 they	 thought	 he	 was	 crazy.	 The	 whole	 statement	 is preposterous." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	 that	 is	 not	 all,"	 I	 hastened	 to	 say.	 "Under	 rigid	 conditions	 scales	 were depressed	without	contact,	and	a	flower,	separating	itself	from	a	bouquet,	passed</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	a	solid	table." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller	made	a	gesture	of	angry	disgust.	"To	save	the	reputation	of	a	really	great</p>
<p class="calibre1">scientist,	don't	quote	any	more	of	that	insane	dreaming." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	didn't	know	any	one	but	campers	in	'Lily	Dale'	could	be	so	bug-house,"	added Howard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	on.	"Crookes	might	have	induced	his	brother	scientists	at	least	to	listen	to his	 report	 had	 he	 stopped	 with	 this.	 But	 he	 proceeded	 to	 say	 that	 he	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">witnessed	the	magic	 birth	of	a	 sentient,	palpable,	intelligent	 human	being,	 who</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>walked	about	in	his	household,	conversing	freely,	while	the	medium,	from	whom the	spirit	form	sprang,	lay	in	the	cabinet	like	one	dead.	It	was	his	account	of	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">'spirit,'	who	called	herself	'Katie	King,'	that	caused	the	whole	scientific	world	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">jeer	at	the	great	chemist	as	a	man	gone	mad." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	have	a	right	to	draw	the	line	between	Crookes	the	chemist	and	Crookes	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">befuddled	dupe,"	insisted	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	 Cameron	 drew	 a	 long	 breath.	 "Do	 you	 mean	 to	 say	 that	 this	 'Katie	 King' </p>
<p class="calibre1">phantom	actually	 <i class="calibre4">talked</i>	with	the	people	in	the	room?	Does	Sir	William	Crookes</p>
<p class="calibre1">say	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes.	Over	and	over	again	he	declares	that	'Katie	King'	appeared	as	real	as	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	else	in	his	house.	He	becomes	quite	lyrical	in	description	of	her	beauty.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	like	a	pearl	in	her	purity.	Her	flesh	seemed	a	sublimation	of	ordinary	human</p>
<p class="calibre1">flesh.	And	the	grace	of	her	manner	was	so	extraordinary	that	Lady	Crookes	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	who	saw	her	became	deeply	enamoured	of	her.	She	allowed	some	of	them	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">kiss	her,	and	Crookes	himself	was	permitted	to	grasp	her	hand	and	walk	up	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	the	room	with	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	was	she	dressed?"	asked	Mrs.	Brush. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There!	 Now	 we	 are	 getting	 at	 the	 essentials,"	 I	 exclaimed.	 "Usually	 in	 white with	a	turban." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did	she	look	like	the	medium?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	 was	 utterly	 unlike	 Miss	 Cook	 in	 several	 physical	 details.	 She	 was	 half	 a head	taller,	her	face	was	broader,	her	ears	had	not	been	pierced,	and	she	was	free</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 certain	 facial	 scars	 that	 Miss	 Cook	 bore;	 and	 once	 when	 Miss	 Cook	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">suffering	 from	 a	 severe	 cold,	 Sir	 William	 tested	 'Katie	 King's'	 lungs	 and	 found them	in	perfect	health.	On	several	occasions	he	and	several	of	his	friends,	among</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	 eminent	 scientists,	 saw	 'Katie'	 and	 the	 medium	 together,	 and	 at	 last</p>
<p class="calibre1">succeeded	 in	 photographing	 them	 both	 on	 the	 same	 plate,	 although	 never	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	 Cook's	 face	 exposed,	 because	 of	 the	 danger,	 to	 one	 in	 a	 trance,	 from	 the shock	of	a	flash-light." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	take	any	stock	in	that	excuse,"	said	Howard.	"But	go	on,	I	like	this." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"For	 months	 the	 great	 chemist	 brought	 all	 his	 skill	 to	 bear	 on	 Miss	 Cook's mediumship	without	detecting	any	fraud	or	finding	any	solution	of	the	mystery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sittings,	which	took	place	in	his	own	library,	were	under	his	own	conditions, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>and	 he	 had	 the	 assistance	 of	 several	 young	 and	 clever	 physicists,	 and	 yet	 he could	 not	 convict	 Miss	 Cook	 of	 double-dealing.	 The	 story	 of	 the	 final	 séance, when	'Katie	King'	announced	her	departure,	is	as	affecting	as	a	scene	in	a	play. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had	said	that	her	real	name	was	'Annie	Morgan,'	but	that	in	the	spirit	world</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 was	 known	 as	 'Katie	 King.'	 She	 came,	 she	 said,	 to	 do	 a	 certain	 work,	 and now,	 after	 three	 years,	 that	 work	 was	 done,	 and	 she	 must	 return	 to	 the	 spirit world." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	was	that	work?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"To	 convince	 the	 world	 of	 the	 spirit	 life,	 I	 imagine.	 'When	 the	 time	 came	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Katie"	to	take	her	farewell,'	writes	Crookes,	'I	asked	that	she	would	let	me	see the	last	of	her.	Accordingly	when	she	had	called	each	of	the	company	up	to	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	had	spoken	a	few	words	in	private,	she	gave	some	general	directions	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">future	 guidance	 and	 protection	 of	 Miss	 Cook.	 From	 these,	 which	 were	 taken</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	 in	 shorthand,	 I	 quote	 the	 following:	 "Mr.	 Crookes	 has	 done	 very	 well throughout,	and	I	leave	Florrie	[the	medium],	with	the	greatest	confidence,	in	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands."	 Having	 concluded	 her	 directions,	 "Katie"	 invited	 me	 into	 the	 cabinet with	her,	and	allowed	me	to	remain	until	the	end.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Touching	confidence!"	interrupted	Harris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'After	 closing	 the	 curtain	 she	 conversed	 with	 me	 for	 some	 time,	 and	 then walked	 across	 to	 where	 Miss	 Cook	 was	 lying	 senseless	 on	 the	 floor.	 Stooping</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	her,	"Katie"	touched	her	and	said:	"Wake	up,	Florrie,	wake	up!	I	must	leave you	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Miss	 Cook	 then	 woke,	 and	 tearfully	 entreated	 "Katie"	 to	 stay	 a	 little	 time longer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'"My	dear,	I	can't;	my	work	is	done.	God	bless	you,"	"Katie"	replied,	and	then continued	 speaking	 to	 Miss	 Cook	 for	 several	 minutes.	 For	 several	 minutes	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">two	were	conversing	with	each	other,	till	at	last	Miss	Cook's	tears	prevented	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">speaking.	Following	"Katie's"	instructions,	I	then	came	forward	to	support	Miss Cook,	 who	 was	 falling	 onto	 the	 floor,	 sobbing	 hysterically.	 I	 looked	 round,	 but the	white-robed	"Katie"	had	gone,	never	to	return	to	the	earth-plane.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 glanced	 about	 the	 table	 at	 my	 silent	 listeners,	 and	 added:	 "Could	 anything	 be more	 dramatic	 than	 this	 sad	 farewell?	 Evidently	 the	 fourth	 dimension	 is	 both</p>
<p class="calibre1">near	and	very	far." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>All	the	women	were	deeply	impressed	with	this	story,	but	to	Miller	it	was	as	idle as	the	blowing	of	the	wind.	"The	man	was	duped.	It	is	absolutely	impossible	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">think	that	he	was	not	grossly	deceived." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait	a	moment,"	said	I.	"I	defy	you	or	any	man	to	remain	unchanged	by	it.	The world	is	just	catching	up	to	this	brave	pioneer.	At	that	time	there	were	very	few</p>
<p class="calibre1">scientific	 men	 in	 the	 metapsychical	 field.	 Sir	 William	 stood	 almost	 alone.	 But public	 sentiment	 changed	 rapidly	 as	 the	 years	 passed.	 The	 English	 Society	 for Psychical	 Research	 was	 formed,	 and	 one	 by	 one	 Wallace,	 Lodge,	 and	 other</p>
<p class="calibre1">scientific	 men	 were	 convinced	 of	 the	 truth	 of	 these	 phenomena.	 In	 Europe,	 as early	as	1853,	the	work	was	taken	up	in	the	true	scientific	spirit,	and	Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Marc	 Thury	 and	 the	 Count	 de	 Gasparin	 completely	 demonstrated	 the	 fact	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">telekinesis;	 and	 at	 about	 the	 same	 time	 that	 the	 Dialectical	 Society	 was	 getting into	action,	Flammarion,	the	astronomer,	took	up	his	study	of	the	subject.	But	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	not	until	1891	that	anything	like	Crookes's	searching	analysis	was	made	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">medium.	 This	 important	 sitting—a	 sitting	 which	 marks	 an	 epoch	 in	 science—</p>
<p class="calibre1">took	place	in	Milan,	and	was	attended,	among	others,	by	Lombroso	and	Richet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 the	 first	 time,	 so	 far	 as	 is	 known,	 a	 flash-light	 photograph	 was	 taken	 of	 a table	floating	in	the	air." </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	this	moment	the	bell	rang,	and	Mrs.	Cameron	exclaimed:	"There!	that	may	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	wonder-worker." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	my	watch.	"I	shouldn't	wonder.	She	is	a	prompt	little	person." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a><b class="calibre3">III</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">We	trooped	into	the	sitting-room,	where	Mrs.	Smiley,	a	plain	little	woman	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sweet	 mouth	 and	 bright	 black	 eyes,	 was	 awaiting	 us.	 She	 was	 perceptibly</p>
<p class="calibre1">abashed	 by	 the	 keen	 glances	 that	 the	 men	 directed	 upon	 her,	 but	 her	 manners were	 those	 of	 one	 natively	 thoughtful	 and	 refined.	 She	 made	 an	 excellent</p>
<p class="calibre1">impression	on	every	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did	 you	 bring	 your	 magic	 horn,	 Mrs.	 Smiley?"	 I	 asked,	 to	 relieve	 her embarrassment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh	yes!"	she	answered,	brightly.	"I	carry	that	just	as	a	fiddler	carries	his	fiddle</p>
<p class="calibre1">—ready	for	a	tune	at	any	moment." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	brought	a	large	package	from	the	foot	of	the	sofa	and	gave	it	to	me.	I	took	it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	turned	it	over	to	Miller.	"Here,	open	this	parcel	yourself,	Mr.	Scientist.	I	want you	to	be	satisfied	as	to	its	character." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller	undid	the	package	as	cautiously	as	if	it	were	an	infernal	machine.	As	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">paper	 opened	 and	 fell	 away,	 a	 short,	 truncated	 cone	 of	 tin	 was	 disclosed,	 with another	 smaller	 one	 loosely	 held	 within	 it.	 The	 two	 sections,	 when	 adjusted, </p>
<p class="calibre1">made	 a	 plain	 megaphone,	 about	 twenty-four	 inches	 in	 length	 and	 some	 five</p>
<p class="calibre1">inches	in	diameter	at	the	larger	end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	do	you	do	with	that?"	asked	Mrs.	Cameron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	a	perfectly	matter-of-fact	way	Mrs.	Smiley	replied:	"Many	of	the	spirit	voices</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	 very	 faint,	 and	 cannot	 be	 heard	 without	 this	 horn.	 I	 am	 what	 they	 call	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">'trumpet	medium,'"	she	added,	in	further	explanation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	you	mean	to	say	spirits	speak	through	that	horn?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes.	That	is	my	'phone.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ladies	looked	at	one	another,	and	Harris	said:	"Isn't	it	rather	absurd	to	expect an	immaterial	mouth	to	speak	through	a	tin	tube,	like	the	grocer's	boy?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 smiled	 composedly.	 "I	 suppose	 it	 seems	 so	 to	 you,	 but	 to	 me	 it	 just happens." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>I	 set	 briskly	 to	 work	 arranging	 the	 library	 for	 the	 circle.	 In	 the	 middle	 of	 the room	 I	 placed	 a	 plain	 oaken	 table,	 which	 had	 been	 procured	 specially	 for	 the sitting.	 On	 this	 I	 stood	 the	 tin	 horn,	 upright	 on	 its	 larger	 end;	 beside	 it	 I	 laid	 a pad,	a	pencil,	and	a	small	slate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mrs.	Smiley,	you	are	to	sit	here,"	I	said,	drawing	an	arm-chair	to	the	end	of	the table	nearest	the	wall.	She	took	her	seat	submissively;	and	looking	around	upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 fellow-members	 with	 a	 full	 knowledge	 of	 what	 was	 in	 their	 minds,	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">remarked:	"If	all	goes	well	to-night,	this	little	woman,	alone	and	unaided,	except</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	 this	 megaphone,	 will	 utterly	 confound	 you.	 We	 have	 had	 many	 sittings.	 We</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand	 each	 other	 perfectly.	 I	 am	 going	 to	 treat	 her	 as	 if	 she	 were	 an unconscious	 trickster.	 I	 am	 going	 to	 use	 every	 effort	 to	 discover	 how	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1">accomplishes	 these	 mysterious	 results,	 and	 Miller	 is	 to	 be	 notably	 remorseless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	are	going	to	concede	(for	the	present)	the	dim	light	required.	I	don't	like	this, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 Mrs.	 Smiley	 is	 giving	 us	 every	 other	 condition,	 and	 as	 this	 is	 but	 a	 trial sitting,	 we	 grant	 it."	 I	 turned	 to	 Miller.	 "The	 theory	 is	 that	 light	 acts	 in	 direct opposition	 to	 the	 psychic	 force,	 weakening	 it	 unaccountably.	 Nevertheless, </p>
<p class="calibre1">darkness	 is	 not	 absolutely	 essential.	 Maxwell	 secured	 many	 convincing</p>
<p class="calibre1">movements	in	the	light,	and	no	doubt	we	shall	be	able	to	do	so	later." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who	is	Maxwell?"	asked	Miss	Brush. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Dr.	 Joseph	 Maxwell,	 Deputy	 Attorney-General	 of	 the	 Court	 of	 Appeals	 at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bordeaux	 and	 Doctor	 of	 Medicine.	 He	 is	 a	 noted	 experimenter	 with	 psychic</p>
<p class="calibre1">forces.	Indeed,	he	has	the	power	himself.	Now,	Mrs.	Smiley,	I	wish	to	begin	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">tests	by	tying	your	wrists	to	the	arms	of	your	chair.	May	I	do	so?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Certainly,"	she	cheerfully	answered.	"You	may	padlock	me,	or	put	me	in	an	iron cage,	if	you	please.	I	leave	it	all	to	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	there	is	a	certain	virtue	in	knotting	a	silk	thread,	for	the	reason	that	it	is almost	 impossible	 to	 untie,	 even	 in	 the	 light,	 and	 to	 break	 it,	 we	 will	 agree, invalidates	the	sitting.	For	to-night	we	will	use	the	thread.	Miller,	will	you	watch</p>
<p class="calibre1">me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"With	the	greatest	pleasure	in	the	world,"	he	answered,	"and	as	a	scientist	I	am going	to	treat	you	as	a	possible	confederate." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Very	good.	Let	each	watch	the	other." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beneath	 the	 gaze	 of	 the	 smiling	 company,	 I	 took	 from	 my	 pocket	 a	 spool	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>strong	silk	twist,	and	proceeded	to	fasten	the	psychic's	wrists.	Each	arm	was	tied separately	 in	 such	 wise	 that	 she	 was	 unable	 to	 bring	 her	 hands	 together,	 and could	 not	 raise	 her	 wrists	 an	 inch	 from	 the	 chair.	 Next,	 with	 the	 aid	 of	 Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cameron,	I	looped	a	long	piece	of	tape	about	Mrs.	Smiley's	ankles,	knotted	it	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	rungs	of	the	chair	at	the	back,	and	nailed	the	loose	ends	to	the	floor.	I	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">drew	chalk	marks	on	the	floor	about	the	chair	legs,	in	order	that	any	movement</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	chair,	no	matter	how	slight,	might	show.	Finally,	I	pushed	the	table	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">two	feet	away	from	the	psychic's	utmost	reach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"With	 this	 arrangement	 we	 ought	 to	 be	 able	 to	 detect	 any	 considerable</p>
<p class="calibre1">movement	on	your	part,"	I	said	to	my	prisoner;	"at	any	rate,	I	think	we	can	keep you	 from	 jumping	 upon	 the	 table.	 Miller,	 you	 are	 to	 sit	 at	 her	 left;	 I	 will	 keep watch	 and	 ward	 at	 her	 right;	 the	 others	 of	 the	 society	 may	 take	 seats	 as	 they please—only	 the	 tradition	 is	 that	 the	 sexes	 should	 alternate.	 Cameron,	 please</p>
<p class="calibre1">lock	both	doors	and	keep	the	keys	in	your	pocket." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	soon	as	we	were	all	seated	and	Cameron	had	locked	the	doors,	I	asked	him	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">turn	down	the	light,	which	he	did,	grumbling:	"I	don't	like	this	part	of	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Neither	do	 I,	 but	at	 a	 first	sitting	 we	 must	 not	expect	 too	 much.	I	 am	 sure	 we shall	be	able	to	have	more	light	later	on.	And	now,	while	we	are	all	getting	into	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">harmonious	frame	of	mind,	suppose	we	ask	Mrs.	Smiley	to	tell	us	a	little	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">herself.	Where	were	you	born,	Mrs.	Smiley?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 replied,	 very	 simply	 and	 candidly:	 "I	 was	 born	 near	 Cincinnati.	 My	 father was	a	spiritualist	early	in	the	'craze,'	as	it	was	called,	and	I	was	about	nine	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 became	 a	 medium.	 At	 first	 we	 did	 not	 know	 that	 I	 was	 the	 psychic.	 Demons seemed	 to	 take	 possession	 of	 our	 house,	 and	 for	 a	 few	 weeks	 nothing	 movable was	 safe.	 After	 awhile	 my	 father	 became	 sure	 that	 I	 was	 the	 cause	 of	 these disturbances,	 because	 everywhere	 I	 went	 raps	 were	 heard:	 the	 movement	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">small	objects	near	where	I	sat	made	me	an	object	of	aversion	or	of	actual	terror</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	my	school-mates.	So	finally	my	father	asked	me	to	sit.	I	didn't	want	to	do	so	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">first,	 but	 he	 told	 me	 it	 was	 my	 duty.	 They	 used	 to	 tie	 me	 in	 every	 way	 and experiment	with	me.	It	was	very	wearisome	to	me,	but	I	submitted,	and	 I	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	devoted	to	the	work	ever	since.	After	my	father	and	mother	died	I	gave	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	 opposition	 to	 my	 gift,	 and	 now	 it	 is	 a	 great	 comfort	 to	 me;	 for	 now	 I	 get messages	from	my	father	and	my	little	daughter	almost	every	day." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	they	speak	to	you	directly?"	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes.	Sometimes	clairaudiently,	but	generally	through	this	cone	when	I	sit	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>dark." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	 do	 you	 mean	 by	 speaking?"	 asked	 Howard.	 "Do	 you	 mean	 they	 sound like	actual	people?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just	as	real	as	you	or	any	one,"	she	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 was	 waiting	 to	 say:	 "Don't	 be	 in	 haste;	 you	 will	 all	 know	 from	 actual experience	what	she	means	by	voices." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Have	you	ever	seen	these	forces	at	work?"	asked	Harris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No;	not	the	way	you	mean.	I	had	a	terrible	shock	once	that	cured	me	of	being</p>
<p class="calibre1">too	 curious.	 I	 was	 holding	 an	 accordion	 under	 a	 table	 by	 its	 bellows	 end,	 as Home	used	to	do,	and	while	the	playing	was	going	on	I	just	believed	if	I	looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">under	the	table	I	could	see	something.	So	I	lifted	the	cover	and	peeped	under.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn't	know	any	more	for	a	long	time.	When	I	came	to	my	father	was	bathing	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">face	and	rubbing	my	hands.	I	never	tried	to	'peek'	after	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	you	mean	that	they	did	this	to	punish	you	for	your	peeping?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes.	They	don't	like	to	have	you	look	directly	at	them	when	they	are	at	work." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	know.	I	never	was	punished	again.	I	didn't	need	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Would	'they'	bat	me	if	I	were	to	peek?"	asked	Howard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	might	not;	but	they	refuse	to	'work'	while	any	one	is	looking." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	that	is	suspicious." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	know	it	is,	but	that	is	the	way	they	act." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	believe	'they'	are	spirits?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	  <i class="calibre4">know</i>	 they	 are,"	 she	 repeated.	 "If	 I	 didn't,	 I	 would	 be	 desolate.	 I	 have	 been sitting	now	for	over	thirty	years,	and	these	friendly	voices	are	a	part	of	my	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	comfort	me	more	than	I	can	tell." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 gave	 this	 account	 of	 herself	 with	 an	 air	 of	 quiet	 conviction	 that	 deeply impressed	the	circle,	and	at	the	end	of	her	little	speech	I	added:	"She	has	agreed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	put	herself	into	our	hands	for	a	series	of	experiments,	and	if	her	health	does</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>not	fail	I	think	we	shall	be	able	to	rival	the	doings	of	Florence	Cook	and	Daniel Home,	whose	mediumships	were	the	basis	of	Crookes's	report.	Now	let	each	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 you	 spread	 his	 hands,	 or	 her	 hands,	 upon	 the	 table,	 just	 touching	 the	 little fingers,	 in	 order	 that	 a	 complete	 circuit	 may	 be	 established.	 Miller	 and	 I	 will make	connection	with	our	psychic." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	all	seems	childish	folly,	but	we'll	do	it,"	said	Harris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	may	we	expect	to	happen	first,	Mrs.	Smiley?"	asked	Mrs.	Cameron,	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	were	in	position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 don't	 know,"	 she	 answered,	 frankly.	 "I	 have	 very	 little	 control	 over	 these forces.	 Often,	 when	 I	 am	 most	 anxious,	 nothing	 happens.	 Please	 don't	 expect</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	of	anything	to-night:	my	first	sittings	in	a	new	place	are	seldom	very	good, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	so	much	depends	upon	those	who	make	up	the	circle.	I	never	sit	without	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fear	that	my	power	has	gone	never	to	come	back." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 helped	 her	 out	 in	 explanation:	 "The	 honest	 medium	 does	 not	 advertise	 to perform	 regularly,	 for	 the	 reason	 that	 this	 force,	 whatever	 it	 is,	 seems	 to	 lie almost	 wholly	 outside	 the	 will.	 Flammarion	 says	 'it	 may	 be	 set	 down	 as	 a	 rule that	all	professional	mediums	cheat.'	That	is	putting	it	pretty	strong;	but	it	seems</p>
<p class="calibre1">true	that	the	condition	which	leads	to	these	phenomena	is	a	very	subtle	physical</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	mental	adjustment,	and	that	the	slightest	distraction	or	mental	unrest	defeats</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything.	 If	 the	 medium	 is	 paid	 for	 her	 work	 she	 is	 too	 eager	 to	 serve,	 and everything	 tempts	 her	 to	 deceive.	 Furthermore,	 it	 has	 been	 proved	 that	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">psychic	is	in	the	very	nature	of	the	case	 <i class="calibre4">extremely	liable	to	suggestion</i>,	and	the combined	 wills	 of	 the	 sitters	 focussed	 on	 one	 desired	 phenomena	 becomes	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost	irresistible	force	to	certain	psychics.	On	the	other	hand,	the	best	observers</p>
<p class="calibre1">say	 that	 the	 most	 striking	 proofs	 of	 spiritualism	 lies	 in	 the	 fact	 that	 the	 most amazing	phenomena	come	in	opposition	to	the	will	of	both	the	psychic	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sitters.	 We	 may	 not	 secure	 a	 single	 movement	 to-night,	 and,	 indeed,	 we	 may</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	two	or	three	barren	sittings,	but	I	am	confident	that	in	the	end	you	will	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">satisfied.	I	am	going	to	attempt	to	put	Mrs.	Smiley	to	sleep	now,	and	when	she	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	her	trance	we	can	discuss	her	methods	freely." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	began	to	hum	a	low,	monotonous	tune,	and	one	by	one	the	others	joined	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">refrain;	soon	the	psychic's	breath	became	labored,	and	in	the	pauses	of	the	song</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	moaned.	At	length	she	drew	her	hands	as	far	away	from	Miller's	and	mine	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	threads	would	permit,	thus	breaking	the	circuit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	 is	 in	 trance,"	 I	 reported.	 "Now	 we	 have	 nothing	 to	 do	 but	 wait.	 You	 may</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>say	anything	you	please,	or	tell	stories	or	sing	songs,	only	don't	argue.	We	will remain	as	we	are	for	a	while,	and	if	the	'guides'	are	dissatisfied,	they	will	order	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">change.	 Generally	 speaking,	 the	 'controls'	 are	 very	 notional,	 and	 when	 we	 get into	 full	 communication	 with	 'them'	 the	 entire	 present	 arrangement	 may	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">broken	up.	The	theory	is	that	all	success	is	due	to	the	co-operation	of	those	'on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	other	side.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	looks	to	me	like	a	plain	case	of	hypnotism	from	this	side,"	remarked	Harris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Aren't	there	any	fixed	rules	to	the	game?"	asked	Howard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"After	 many	 years'	 exhaustive	 study	 of	 these	 antic	 spirits	 (approaching	 them always	from	the	naturalistic	side),	Maxwell	deduces	certain	helpful	rules:	'Use	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">small	room,'	he	says,	'and	have	it	warm.	Medium	and	sitters	must	not	have	cold</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands	or	feet.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	can	understand	the	psychic	having	cold	feet	now	and	then,"	interjected	Harris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Maxwell	 finds	 dry	 air	 and	 clear	 weather	 most	 favorable;	 rainy	 and	 windy weather	 often	 cause	 failures.	 There	 seems	 to	 be	 some	 connection	 with	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">electrical	 condition	 of	 the	 atmosphere.	 After	 proving	 that	 a	 white	 light	 deters phenomena,	he	uses	green,	violet,	or	yellow	screens	for	his	lamps.	'Any	kind	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">table	will	do	for	the	raps,	or	for	levitation,'	he	says,	'but	one	with	a	double	top</p>
<p class="calibre1">seems	to	give	best	results.'	His	sitters	use	wooden	chairs	with	cane	seats,	and	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">own	experience	is	that	a	bare	floor	helps.	He	especially	directs	that	the	guide	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">consulted—'let	the	phenomena	come	as	spontaneously	as	possible,'	he	adds." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Does	he	find	this	sandwiching	of	the	sexes	helpful?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes.	 He	 says	 six	 or	 eight	 people,	 men	 and	 women	 alternating,	 make	 the	 best circle.	'Take	things	seriously,	but	not	solemnly,'	he	advises.	'Don't	argue;	address</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	"control,"	and	follow	his	advice.	Avoid	confusion	by	electing	a	director	and asking	 for	 only	 one	 thing	 at	 a	 time.	 Keep	 the	 same	 people	 in	 the	 group	 for	 at least	six	sittings.	Sit	in	a	circle	and	touch	hands.	Be	patient	and	good-tempered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 worried,	 irritated,	 sullen	 medium	 is	 a	 poor	 instrument.	 Finally'—and	 this	 is most	 important—'don't	 overwork	 the	 medium.'	 And	 with	 this	 important</p>
<p class="calibre1">statement	 he	 ends:	 '  <i class="calibre4">I	 am	 persuaded	 of	 the	 absolute	 harmlessness	 of	 these</i> <i class="calibre4">experiments,	provided	they	are	properly	conducted. </i>'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	am	glad	to	know	that,"	said	Mrs.	Quigg.	"After	seeing	Mrs.	Harris's	trance,	I was	in	doubt." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>"Maxwell's	hints	are	 extremely	valuable	to	 me,"	I	continued,	 "for	they	confirm my	own	methods,	some	of	which	I	had	to	learn	by	tedious	experience.	If	I	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">known,	for	instance,	the	folly	of	allowing	everybody	to	quiz	the	psychic,	I	might</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 been	 spared	 many	 hours	 of	 tiresome	 sitting.	 Maxwell	 is,	 indeed,	 an	 ideal investigator—he	 has	 made	 a	 great	 advance	 in	 methods,	 and	 his	 conclusions, </p>
<p class="calibre1">though	 tentative,	 are	 most	 suggestive.	 No	 unprejudiced	 reader	 can	 finish	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">book,  <i class="calibre4">Metapsychical	 Phenomena</i>,	 without	 feeling	 that	 its	 author	 is	 a	 brave	 and fearless	writer,	as	well	as	a	cautious	and	sane	reasoner.	His	published	experience</p>
<p class="calibre1">throws	a	flood	of	light	on	mediums	and	their	puzzling	peculiarities." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	it	seems	to	me	those	rules	give	the	medium	and	his	'guides'	the	free	hand," </p>
<p class="calibre1">said	Miller,	discontentedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"By	 no	 means,"	 I	 retorted.	 "Maxwell	 plainly	 says,	 'Where	 the	 "control"	 is insisting	upon	something	which	I	do	not	like,	I	politely	resist,	and	end	by	getting</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	own	way.'	Note	the	'politely.'	In	short,	he	recognizes	that	a	genuine	medium</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	a	very	precious	instrument,	and	he	does	not	begin	by	clubbing	him—or	her—</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	 submission.	 For	 all	 their	 wondrous	 powers,	 the	 people	 who	 possess	 these</p>
<p class="calibre1">powers	are	very	weak.	They	are	not	allowed	to	make	anything	more	than	a	living</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	 of	 the	 practise	 of	 the	 magic,	 and	 they	 live	 under	 the	 threat	 of	 having	 the power	 withdrawn.	 They	 are	 helpless	 in	 the	 face	 of	 a	 challenge	 to	 produce	 the phenomena,	and	yet	the	hidden	forces	are	themselves	helpless	without	them—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	the	table	throbbing?"	asked	Brierly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	feel	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Have	 you	 ever	 had	 any	 convincing	 evidence	 of	 this	 psychic	 force—such	 as movement	of	objects	without	contact?"	asked	Harris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes.	I	have	had	a	table	rise	at	least	twenty	inches	from	the	floor	in	the	full	light, with	no	one	present	but	the	medium	and	myself,	and	while	our	finger-tips	alone</p>
<p class="calibre1">touched	 the	 top.	 It	 felt	 as	 if	 it	 were	 floating	 in	 a	 thick	 and	 resilient	 liquid,	 and when	 I	 pressed	 upon	 it,	 it	 oscillated,	 in	 a	 curious	 way,	 as	 if	 the	 power	 were applied	from	below	and	in	the	centre	of	the	table.	The	psychic	was	a	young	girl, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I	am	certain	played	no	trick.	I	could	see	her	feet	on	the	floor,	and	her	finger-</p>
<p class="calibre1">tips	 were,	 like	 mine,	 on	 the	 top	 of	 the	 table.	 This	 was	 the	 clearest	 test	 of levitation	I	ever	had,	but	the	lifting	of	a	pencil	in	independent	writing	is	the	same</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing	in	effect." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	see	you	have	acquired	all	the	'patter,'"	remarked	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>"Oh,	yes	indeed;	all	the	'patter,'	and	some	of	the	guile.	For	instance,	when	I	want to	 use	 'those	 who	 have	 passed	 on'	 I	 do	 so,	 and	 when	 I	 don't	 I	 invent	 means	 to deceive	them." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Quigg	caught	me	up	on	that.	"Can	you	deceive	'them'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	know	that	I	do,	really;	but,	at	any	rate,	'they'	are	not	always	mind-readers</p>
<p class="calibre1">—that	 I	 have	 proved	 very	 conclusively.	 In	 all	 my	 experience	 I	 have	 never	 had any	satisfactory	evidence	of	the	clairvoyance	of	these	manifesting	intelligences." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	thought	'they'	could	read	one's	every	thought." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	do	not	find	that	'they'	can	read	so	much	as	 <i class="calibre4">one</i>	of	my	thoughts,	and	I	would not	invest	a	dollar	on	their	recommendations.	Seldom	does	so	much	as	a	familiar</p>
<p class="calibre1">name	come	up	in	my	sittings,	and	no	message	of	any	intimate	sort	has	ever	come</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 the	 shadow	 world	 for	 me.	 The	 messages	 are	 intelligent,	 but	 below	 rather than	above	the	average.	'They'	always	seem	very	fallible,	very	human	to	me,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing	'they'	do	startles	me.	I	have	no	patience	with	those	who	make	much	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	morbid	side	of	this	business.	To	me	it	is	neither	'theism'	nor	'diabolism,'	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	neither	destruction	of	an	old	religion	or	the	basis	of	a	new	one—But	all	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">verges	 on	 the	 controversial,	 and	 is	 not	 good	 for	 our	 psychic.	 Let's	 sing	 some good	 old	 tune,	 like	 'Suwanee	 River'	 or	 'Lily	 Dale.'	 We	 must	 keep	 to	 the	 genial side	of	conversation.	Spread	your	hands	wide	on	the	table	and	be	as	comfortable</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	you	can.	We	may	have	to	wait	a	long	time	now,	all	on	Miller's	account." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Because	he	is	a	sceptic?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No;	 because	 he's	 belligerent,"	 I	 answered.	 "It	 doesn't	 matter	 whether	 you believe	or	not	if	you	do	not	stir	up	controversy.	Miller's	'suggestion'	is	adverse	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	serenity	of	the	psychic,	that's	all.	The	old-time	sleepy	back-parlor	logic	has</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	weight	with	me.	Maxwell	and	Flammarion	are	my	guides." </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">For	four	hours	we	sat	thus,	and	nothing	happened. </i>	How	I	kept	them	at	it	I	do	not now	 understand,	 but	 they	 stayed.	 We	 sang,	 joked,	 told	 stories,	 gossiped	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">desperate	effort	to	kill	time,	and	not	one	rap,	tap,	or	crackle	came	to	guide	us	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 give	 indication	 of	 the	 presence	 of	 any	 unusual	 power.	 Part	 of	 the	 time	 Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Smiley	 was	 awake	 and	 sorely	 grieved	 at	 her	 failure.	 She	 understood	 very	 well the	position	in	which	I	seemed	to	stand.	To	Miller	I	was	a	dupe,	the	victim	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">trickster.	He	himself	afterward	confessed	that	at	the	time	he	almost	regretted	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">preternatural	 acuteness,	 and	 was	 ready	 to	 take	 himself	 away	 in	 order	 to	 let	 the show	 go	 on.	 But	 he	 didn't,	 and	 from	 time	 to	 time	 I	 encouraged	 our	 psychic	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>saying:	"Never	mind,	Mrs.	Smiley,	there	are	other	evenings	to	come.	We	will	not despair." </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	last	she	sank	into	profound	sleep,	and	at	exactly	twelve	o'clock	I	heard	a	faint</p>
<p class="calibre1">tapping	 on	 top	 of	 the	 piano,	 just	 behind	 Miller.	 "Hooray,	 here	 they	 are!"	 I exclaimed,	 with	 vast	 relief.	 "What	 is	 the	 matter?"	 I	 asked	 of	 "the	 presence." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Aren't	we	sitting	right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">No</i>,"	was	the	answer,	by	means	of	one	decided	tap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Am	I	right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">No</i>,"	answered	the	taps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 may	 explain	 at	 this	 point	 that	 in	 the	 accepted	 code	 of	 signals	 one	 tap	 means</p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">No</i>,"	three	taps	mean	"  <i class="calibre4">Yes</i>,"	and	two	taps,	"  <i class="calibre4">Don't	know</i>,"	"  <i class="calibre4">Will	try</i>,"	or	any	other doubtful	state	of	mind.	One	has,	of	course,	to	guess	at	the	precise	meaning;	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	may	confirm	one's	interpretation	by	putting	it	in	the	form	of	a	question	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	be	answered	by	"  <i class="calibre4">Yes</i>"	or	"  <i class="calibre4">No</i>." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shall	I	change	with	Miller?"	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three	brisk	taps	made	affirmative	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 exchanged	 places	 with	 Miller,	 but	 did	 not	 again	 touch	 Mrs.	 Smiley's	 hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately	 thereafter	 the	 sound	 of	 soft	 drumming	 came	 from	 the	 piano	 at	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">point	 entirely	 out	 of	 reach	 of	 the	 psychic,	 and	 at	 my	 request	 the	 drummer	 kept time	 to	 my	 whistling.	 After	 some	 minutes	 of	 this	 foolery	 "the	 force"	 left	 the piano	abruptly,	as	if	with	a	leap,	and	dropped	to	the	middle	of	the	table.	A	light, </p>
<p class="calibre1">fumbling	noise	followed,	and	I	called	out:	"Is	every	hand	in	the	circle	accounted</p>
<p class="calibre1">for?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	the	members	of	the	group	were,	in	turn,	assuring	me	of	this,	a	small	bell</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	table	was	taken	up	and	rung,	and	the	table	itself	was	shoved	powerfully</p>
<p class="calibre1">toward	 the	 circle	 and	 away	 from	 the	 psychic.	 I	 assure	 you,	 my	 sitters	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">profoundly	 interested	 now,	 and	 some	 of	 the	 women	 were	 startled.	 A	 sharp, </p>
<p class="calibre1">pecking	 sound	 came	 upon	 the	 cone.	 I	 called	 attention	 to	 the	 fact	 that	 this	 took place	at	least	six	feet	from	the	psychic,	and	a	moment	later,	with	intent	to	detect</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 in	 any	 movement,	 I	 leaned	 far	 forward	 so	 that	 my	 head	 came	 close	 to	 her breast.	I	could	not	discern	the	slightest	motion;	I	could	not	even	hear	her	breathe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	this,	while	very	impressive	to	me,	was	referred	by	the	others	to	trickery	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Smiley's	part. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>At	 my	 request,	 the	 drumming	 on	 the	 cone	 kept	 time	 to	 "Dixey"	 and	 "Yankee Doodle,"	and	at	length	I	said	to	"the	spirit":	"You	must	have	liked	topical	songs when	you	were	on	the	earth-plane." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instantly	 <i class="calibre4">the	cone	was	swept	violently	from	the	table,	and	a	deep,	jovial,	strong</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">whisper	came	from	the	horn	to	me</i>.	"  <i class="calibre4">I	do	now</i>,"	was	the	amazing	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who	are	you?"	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">Wilbur	Thompson. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	it	is	you,	is	it?	Well,	I	am	glad	you've	found	a	voice;	I	felt	rather	helpless	up to	this	moment.	Are	we	sitting	right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">All	right. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	are	you	going	to	do	for	us	to-night?	Can	you	raise	the	table?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">I'll	try</i>,"	he	whispered	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are	there	other	'spirits'	here?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">Yes;	many. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can't	'they'	write	their	names	on	the	pad?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	moment's	silence,	and	then	the	sound	of	writing	began	in	the	middle</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	table.	When	this	had	finished,	I	said,	"Did	you	succeed?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again	 the	 cone	 rose,	 and	 another	 whisper,	 a	 fainter	 voice,	 answered:	 "  <i class="calibre4">Yes,	 but</i> <i class="calibre4">the	writing	is	very	miserable. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 rest	 of	 the	 sitters	 were	 silent	 with	 amazement	 till	 Miller	 said,	 in	 a	 tone	 of disgust:	"That	is	of	no	value.	It	is	so	easy	for	Howard,	or	some	one	else,	to	break the	circle	and	write	or	speak	through	the	cone." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	we'll	have	to	trust	one	another	for	to-night,"	I	admitted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	psychic	now	began	to	twist	and	moan	and	struggle,	choking,	gasping	in	such</p>
<p class="calibre1">evident	 suffering	 that	 Mrs.	 Cameron	 cried	 out:	 "Mr.	 Garland,	 don't	 you	 hear? </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	is	ill!	Let	me	go	to	her!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	 be	 alarmed,"	 I	 replied.	 "This	 struggle	 almost	 always	 precedes	 her strongest	 manifestations.	 It	 seems	 cruel	 to	 say	 so,	 but,	 remember,	 Mrs.	 Smiley</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>has	been	through	these	paroxysms	hundreds	of	times.	It	appears	very	painful	and exhausting,	but	she	has	assured	me	that	'they'	take	care	of	her.	She	suffers	almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	ill	effects	from	her	trance." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller,	living	up	to	his	character	as	remorseless	scientist,	remarked:	"I'd	like	to control	her	hands.	Shall	I	try?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	now,	not	till	the	'guides'	consent	to	it,"	I	replied.	"It	is	said	to	be	dangerous to	the	psychic	to	touch	her	unexpectedly." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 can	 understand	 that	 it	 might	 be	 inconvenient,"	 remarked	 Harris,	 with	 biting brevity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again	 we	 sat	 in	 expectant	 silence	 until	 several	 of	 the	 group	 became	 restless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	is	she	about	now?"	asked	Cameron,	wearily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	is	in	dead	trance,	apparently.	Please	be	patient	a	little	while	longer.	Are	you still	with	us,	'Wilbur'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	delighted	to	hear	the	three	taps	that	answer	"  <i class="calibre4">Yes</i>." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Will	you	be	able	to	do	something	more	for	us?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Tap,	tap,	tap</i>—given	apparently	with	the	pencil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 observed:	 "From	 a	 strictly	 scientific	 standpoint,	 the	 movement	 of	 that	 pencil, provided	it	can	be	proved	to	have	taken	place	without	the	agency	of	any	known</p>
<p class="calibre1">form	of	force,	is	as	important	as	the	fall	of	a	mountain.	It	heralds	a	new	day	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">science.	 Is	 every	 hand	 accounted	 for?"	 Each	 answered,	 "  <i class="calibre4">Yes</i>."	 At	 this	 moment there	was	a	rustling	at	the	base	of	the	cone.	"Listen!	'they'	are	at	work	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">horn." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cone	rocked	slowly	on	its	base,	and	at	last	leaped	over	the	shoulders	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sitters	and	fell	with	a	crash	to	the	floor.	"Mercy	on	us!"	gasped	Mrs.	Cameron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	touch	it!	Don't	move!"	I	called	out.	"Everybody	clasp	hands	now.	Here	is a	chance	for	a	fine	test.	'Wilbur,'	can	you	put	the	cone	back	on	the	table?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Tap,	tap</i>,	answered	"Wilbur."	The	two	taps	were	given	slowly,	and	I	understood them	to	mean	"  <i class="calibre4">Don't	know</i>"	or	"  <i class="calibre4">Will	try</i>." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Miller,"	I	said,	impressively,	"unless	some	one	of	our	circle	is	betraying	us,	we are	having	as	good	a	demonstration	as	we	could	expect,	barring	the	absence	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>light.	 Be	 watchful.	 'Wilbur,'	 we're	 trusting	 to	 you	 now.	 Let's	 see	 what	 you	 can do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	spoke,	the	horn,	with	a	ringing	scrape,	left	the	carpet,	and	a	moment	later</p>
<p class="calibre1">bumped	down	upon	Mrs.	Quigg's	head.	"Oh!"	she	shrieked,	"it	hit	me!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Almost	immediately	a	breathy	chuckle	came	from	the	horn:	"  <i class="calibre4">Ha,	ha!	That	shook</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">you	up	a	little,	I	reckon. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	other	women	were	frozen	with	horror.	"Don't	let	it	touch	me,"	pleaded	Miss Brush. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	Mrs.	Quigg,	much	shaken,	called	out:	"Frank	Howard,	are	you	doing	this?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	highly	indignant.	"Certainly	not.	Are	you	not	holding	one	hand	and	Miss</p>
<p class="calibre1">Brush	the	other?	I	am	in-no-cent;	I	swear	it!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	commented	on	their	dialogue	severely.	"See	how	you	all	treat	an	event	that	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">wonderful	 enough	 to	 convulse	 the	 National	 Academy	 of	 Science.	 I	 do	 not</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe	the	psychic's	hands	have	moved	an	inch,	and	yet,	unless	some	one	of	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 false	 to	 his	 trust,	 the	 miraculous	 has	 happened—Are	 you	 there,	 'Wilbur?'"	 I queried	of	the	mystic	presence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cone	swung	toward	me,	and	"Wilbur"	answered:	"  <i class="calibre4">I	am,	old	horse. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	Wilbur,	there	are	two	bigoted	scientific	people	here	to-night,	and	I	want</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	to	put	them	to	everlasting	rout." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">I'll	do	it,	don't	you	worry</i>,"	replied	the	voice,	and	the	cone	dropped	with	a	bang on	the	table,	again	making	everybody	jump. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">That	brought	the	goose-flesh</i>!"	remarked	"Wilbur,"	with	humorous	satisfaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 took	 a	 malicious	 delight	 in	 the	 mystification	 of	 my	 fellows.	 "Go	 down	 and shake	up	young	Howard	at	the	foot	of	the	table,"	I	suggested.	"He	is	a	little	in	the conjuring	line	himself." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Almost	instantly	Howard	cried	out:	"The	blooming	thing	is	touching	me	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ear!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Observe,"	called	I,	in	the	tone	of	a	man	exhibiting	some	kind	of	trained	animal, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"the	cone	is	now	at	least	six	feet	from	the	psychic's	utmost	reach.	How	do	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">account	for	that,	Miller?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>"The	boy	lied,"	said	Miller,	curtly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Howard	was	offended.	"I'll	take	that	out	of	you,	old	chap,	when	we	meet	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">street.	I	am	telling	the	square-toed	truth.	I	am	not	doing	a	thing	but	hold	two	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">scared	ladies'	hands." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	 come	 now!"	 I	 interposed.	 "If	 we	 are	 to	 be	 so	 'tarnal	 suspicious	 of	 one another,	 we	 might	 just	 as	 well	 give	 up	 the	 sitting.	 If	 each	 of	 us	 must	 be padlocked,	proof	of	any	phenomenon	is	impossible." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 firmer	 hand	 now	 seemed	 to	 grasp	 the	 cone,	 and	 a	 deep	 whisper	 that	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost	 a	 tone	 came	 from	 it.	 "  <i class="calibre4">You	 are	 right</i>,"	 this	 new	 personality	 said,	 with measured	 and	 precise	 utterance.	 "  <i class="calibre4">We	 come	 with	 the	 best	 tests	 of	 a	 supremely</i> <i class="calibre4">important	 revelation;	 we	 come	 as	 scientists	 from	 our	 side	 of	 the	 line;	 and	 you</i> <i class="calibre4">scoff,	and	take	it	all	as	a	piece	of	folly,	as	an	entertainment.	Is	this	just?	No,	it	is</i> <i class="calibre4">unworthy	men	of	science. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	are	entirely	justified	in	your	indignation,"	I	responded.	"But	who	are	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">My	name	on	the	earth-plane	was	Mitchell. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 am	 glad	 to	 make	 your	 acquaintance,	 'Mr.	 Mitchell,'	 and	 your	 rebuke	 is deserved.	I,	for	one,	mean	to	proceed	in	this	matter	seriously.	What	can	you	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	us	to-night?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">Be	very	patient.	Carry	this	investigation	forward,	and	this	psychic	will	astonish</i> <i class="calibre4">the	world.	Do	not	abuse	her;	do	not	tax	her	beyond	her	strength. </i>"	He	spoke	with the	 precise	 and	 rather	 pedantic	 accent	 of	 an	 old	 gentleman	 nurtured	 on	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">classics,	 and	 produced	 upon	 me	 a	 distinct	 impression	 of	 age	 and	 serious</p>
<p class="calibre1">demeanor	utterly	different	from	the	rollicking,	not	too	refined	"Wilbur." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	will	see	that	she	is	treated	fairly,	'Mr.	Mitchell,'	but	of	course	this	is	not	a	rigid test.	Will	you	be	able	to	permit	conditions	more	convincing?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">Yes,	very	much	more	convincing</i>,"	 he	 replied,	 slowly	 and	 ponderously,	 "  <i class="calibre4">but	 do</i> <i class="calibre4">not	worry	the	instrument	to-night.	Narrow	your	circle;	be	harmonious,	and	not</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">too	eager,	and	you	will	be	abundantly	rewarded</i>." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Won't	you	tell	me	who	you	were	on	the	earth-plane?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">I	was	a	friend	of	the	father	of	the	instrument</i>,"	he	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	horn	returned	to	the	table	quietly,	and	young	Howard	was	the	first	to	speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>"That	is	a	fine	piece	of	ventriloquism,	any	way	you	look	at	it,"	said	he.	"It	is	a nice	trick	to	give	that	peculiar	tinny	sound	to	a	whisper." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	far	as	I	can	judge,	so	far	as	my	sense	of	hearing	goes	(and	I	have	kept	my	ear</p>
<p class="calibre1">close	 to	 the	 psychic's	 face),	 Mrs.	 Smiley	 has	 not	 moved,	 nor	 uttered	 a	 sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	is	your	verdict,	Mr.	Cocksure	Scientist?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	the	first	time	Miller's	voice	indicated	some	slight	hesitation.	"I	haven't	been able	 to	  <i class="calibre4">detect</i>	 any	 movement	 on	 the	 part	 of	 the	 psychic,"	 he	 replied,	 "but	 of course	 I	 can't	 answer	 for	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 company.	 The	 performance	 has	 no</p>
<p class="calibre1">scientific	value.	In	the	dark,	deceit	is	easy.	Harris	may	be	the	ventriloquist." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why	 not	 accuse	 the	 arch-conspirator	 of	 us	 all,	 our	 director?"	 exclaimed	 Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quigg. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	flatter	me,"	I	responded.	"If	I	could	produce	those	voices	I	would	go	on	the vaudeville	stage	to-morrow.	I	give	you	my	word	I	am	acting	in	entire	good	faith. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 am	 quite	 as	 eager	 for	 the	 truth	 as	 any	 of	 you.—But,	 hark!	 the	 cone	 is	 on	 the wing	again." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 megaphone	 was	 indeed	 moving,	 as	 if	 a	 weak,	 unskilled	 hand	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">struggling	with	it,	and	at	last	it	swung	feebly	into	the	air,	and	a	whisper	that	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">hardly	more	than	a	breath	was	directed	toward	Mrs.	Quigg:	"  <i class="calibre4">Daughter! </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are	you	speaking	to	me?"	she	asked,	in	a	voice	that	trembled	a	little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	answer	was	but	a	sibilant	sigh:	"  <i class="calibre4">Yes. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who	are	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">Mother. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	answer	was	so	faint	that	no	one	save	Mrs.	Quigg	could	distinguish	the	word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Almost	 at	 the	 same	 moment	 I	 caught	 the	 sound	 of	 other	 moving	 lips	 in	 the	 air just	before	me.	"Who	is	it?"	I	asked.	Like	a	little,	hopeless	sigh	the	answer	came:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">Jessie. </i>"	 This	 was	 the	 name	 of	 my	 younger	 sister.	 Then	 the	 cone	 dropped	 as though	 falling	 from	 exhausted	 hands,	 and	 I	 had	 no	 further	 message	 from	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1">"spirit." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	waited	breathlessly	the	clear,	silver-sweet	voice	of	a	little	girl	was	heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	every	one	at	the	table.	"  <i class="calibre4">Good-evening,	everybody.	I	am	Maud;	I	came	with	my</i> <i class="calibre4">mamma.	I	have	come	to	ask	you	to	be	very	kind	to	her. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>"I	 am	 very	 glad	 to	 hear	 you,	 'Maud,'"	 I	 answered.	 "Are	 there	 other	 spirits present?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">Yes,	many,	many	spirits.	My	grandpa	is	here;	he	is	treating	my	mamma	so	that</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">she	will	not	be	sick.	Some	one	is	here	to	see	you,	but	is	too	weak	to	speak.	My</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">grandpa	says	'we	are	trusting	you.' </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 astonishing	 clearness	 this	 voice	 created	 in	 my	 mind	 (not	 as	 light	 would create	 it)	 the	 vision	 of	 a	 self-contained,	 womanly	 little	 girl,	 whose	 voice	 and accent	formed	a	curious	silvery	replica	of	the	psychic's,	and	yet	I	could	not	say</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 the	 psychic's	 vocal	 organs	 gave	 out	 these	 words.	 At	 last	 she	 said	 "  <i class="calibre4">Good-bye</i>,"	and	the	cone	was	softly	laid	upon	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	of	this	was	performed	in	profound	silence.	There	was	no	sound	in	the	cone, </p>
<p class="calibre1">except	that	of	the	voice,	no	rustle	of	garments,	no	grasp	of	fingers	on	the	tin;	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">though	I	leaned	far	over,	and	once	more	placed	my	ear	close	to	the	psychic's	lips, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	could	not	trace	the	slightest	movement	connecting	her	with	the	movements	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	table.	I	had	the	conviction	at	the	moment	that	she	sat	in	a	death-like	trance	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	moments	later	the	cone	was	jammed	together	and	thrown	upon	the	floor—</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	movement,	I	had	learned	to	know,	that	announced	that	the	sitting	was	ended. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	the	sitters	still	waited,	I	said:	"Now,	Cameron,	you	may	turn	on	the	gas, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	do	so	very	slowly.	Mrs.	Smiley	seems	in	deep	sleep,	and	we	are	warned	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	startle	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 the	 light	 became	 strong	 enough	 to	 see	 a	 form,	 we	 found	 our	 psychic</p>
<p class="calibre1">sitting	 limply,	 her	 head	 drooping	 sidewise,	 her	 eyes	 closed,	 her	 face	 white	 and calm.	 The	 cone	 was	 lying	 not	 far	 from	 her	 chair,	 separated	 into	 two	 parts.	 The threads	 that	 bound	 her	 to	 her	 seat	 were	 to	 all	 appearance	 precisely	 as	 at	 the beginning	of	the	sitting,	except	that	they	were	deeply	sunk	into	the	flesh	of	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrists.	 Her	 chair	 had	 not	 moved	 a	 hair's-breadth	 from	 the	 chalk-marks	 on	 the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 moment	 later	 she	 opened	 her	 eyes,	 and,	 smiling	 rather	 wanly,	 asked	 of	 me:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did	anything	happen?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh	yes,	a	great	deal.	'Wilbur'	came,	and	'Maud,'	and	'Mr.	Mitchell.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	am	very	glad,"	she	answered,	with	a	faint,	happy	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>Mrs.	Cameron	bent	to	her	pityingly.	"How	do	you	feel?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Very	numb,	but	I'll	be	all	right	in	a	very	short	time.	My	wrists	hurt;	your	thread is	very	tight.	My	arms	always	swell.	Please	give	me	a	drink	of	water." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 I	 held	 the	 glass	 to	 her	 lips	 I	 was	 conscience-smitten	 to	 think	 that	 for	 five hours	she	had	been	sitting	in	this	constrained	position—a	martyr	to	science;	but	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">deferred	the	moment	of	her	release	till	Miller	had	examined	every	bond.	I	used	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">small	pair	of	scissors	to	cut	the	thread	out	of	the	deep	furrows	in	her	wrist,	and	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">took	a	quarter	of	an	hour	of	chafing	to	restore	her	arms	to	their	normal	condition, </p>
<p class="calibre1">all	of	which	had	a	convincing	effect	upon	the	doubters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Brush	was	indignant.	"I	think	it	is	a	shame	the	way	you	have	treated	your</p>
<p class="calibre1">psychic." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	this	is	nothing,"	responded	Mrs.	Smiley.	"I'd	be	unhappy	and	uneasy	if	you didn't	 tie	 me.	 I'm	 like	 the	 old	 man's	 chickens	 (you've	 heard	 the	 story?):	 he	 had moved	 so	 much	 that	 the	 chickens,	 whenever	 they	 saw	 him	 put	 a	 cover	 on	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">wagon,	would	lie	down	and	cross	their	feet	to	be	tied." </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	Mrs.	Cameron	had	taken	Mrs.	Smiley	to	the	dining-room	for	a	cup	of	tea, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	rest	of	us	remained	staring	at	one	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now,	which	of	us	did	that?"	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	 far	 as	 the	 psychic	 was	 concerned,	 I	 don't	 see	 how	 she	 could	 have	 had	 any hand	in	it,"	said	Miller.	"But,	then,	it	was	all	in	the	dark." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	to	admit	that	this	diminished	the	value	of	the	experiment.	"But	now	listen," </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said:	"as	we	all	seem	to	be	suspicious	of	one	another,	I	propose	that	we	resort</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	a	process	of	elimination.	I	shall	take	'Mitchell's'	advice	and	narrow	the	circle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Howard,	you	are	a	suspect.	You	are	ruled	out	of	the	next	sitting." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh	no,"	protested	Howard.	"That	isn't	fair.	I	did	nothing,	I	swear!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	admit	being	a	prestidigitator?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	but	I	had	nothing	to	do	with	this	performance." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nevertheless,	 so	 far	 as	 conclusive	 proof	 is	 concerned,	 your	 presence	 in	 the circle	invalidates	it.	Now	I	propose	that	Mrs.	Smiley	go	to	Miller's	house,	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	one	present	but	Mr.	and	Mrs.	Cameron	and	Mr.	and	Mrs.	Miller.	If	we	secure</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	 same	 phenomena	 under	 Miller's	 conditions,	 we	 will	 then	 readmit	 one	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>one	the	entire	membership	of	the	society." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Quigg	resented	being	left	out,	and	I	pretended	surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	thought	from	what	you	had	said	that	these	'dark	shows'	were	of	no	value?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	next	one	ought	to	have	decided	value	if	Professor	Miller	has	any	share	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	test,"	she	answered,	quickly.	"I	believe	in	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	not	in	me?	That's	a	nice	thing	to	say." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	mean	in	his	method.	He	is	a	cold,	calm,	merciless	scientist.	You're	a	man	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagination." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank	you,"	said	I.	"My	critics	would	take	issue	with	you	there.	However,	if	we get	 anywhere	 in	 this	 campaign	 we	 must	 begin	 with	 the	 smallest	 possible	 circle and	slowly	enlarge	it.	We	hope	also	to	increase	the	amount	of	light." </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	some	further	argument,	Cameron	settled	the	matter	by	saying:	"Garland	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">right;	 and,	 to	 show	 my	 own	 scientific	 temper,	 I	 rule	 Mrs.	 Cameron	 and	 myself out	 of	 the	 next	 sitting.	 That	 will	 put	 the	 whole	 problem	 up	 to	 Miller	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Garland." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller	 and	 I	 walked	 away	 to	 the	 club	 together,	 pondering	 deeply	 on	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">implications	of	the	night's	performance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	see	how	it	was	done,"	Miller	repeated.	"Certainly	she	did	not	rise	from her	 chair,	 not	 for	 an	 instant,	 and	 yet	 to	 believe	 that	 she	 did	 not	 have	 a	 hand	 in what	took	place	is	to	admit	the	impossible.	You	have	had	other	sittings	with	her, </p>
<p class="calibre1">haven't	you?	You	believe	in	her?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	 I	 think	 she	 is	 sincere,	 but	 possibly	 self-deceived.	 The	 fact	 that	 she	 is willing	to	put	herself	into	our	hands	in	this	way	is	most	convincing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	 is	 nothing	 of	 the	 trickster	 about	 her	 appearance,	 and	 yet	 I	 wish	 she	 had permitted	us	to	hold	her	hands	to-night." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Miller,"	said	I,	earnestly,	"if	you'll	go	with	me	into	this	experimentation	with	an open	mind,	I'll	convince	you	that	Crookes	and	Flammarion	are	the	true	scientists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	the	fashion	to	smile	at	Flammarion	as	a	romantic	astronomer,	but	I	can't	see</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">now</i>	 that	 he	 is	 lacking	 in	 patience	 and	 caution.	 For	 all	 his	 rather	 fervid utterances,	 he	 keeps	 his	 head	 and	 goes	 on	 patiently	 investigating.	 He	 has	 had more	 experience	 than	 even	 Crookes	 or	 Lombroso.	 For	 forty	 years	 he	 has	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a>searching	the	dark	for	these	strange	forces,	and	yet	he	says:	'We	create	in	these séances	 an	 imaginary	 being;	 we	 speak	 to	 it,	 and	 in	 its	 replies	 it	 almost	 always reflects	 the	 mentality	 of	 the	 experimenter.	 Spirits	 have	 taught	 us	 nothing.	 They have	not	led	science	forward	a	single	step....	I	must	say	that	if	there	are	spirits,	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">beings	 independent	 of	 us,	 in	 action,	 they	 know	 no	 more	 than	 we	 do	 about	 the other	world's.'	And	yet	as	regards	the	physical	facts	of	mediumship,	he	sustains</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	the	investigators.	'These	phenomena	exist,'	he	says." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Candidly,	 Garland,	 what	 is	 your	 own	 belief?"	 asked	 Miller,	 a	 few	 moment's later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 evaded	 him.	 "I	 have	 seen	 enough	 to	 make	 me	 believe	 in	 Zöllner's	 fourth dimension,	but	I	don't.	My	mind	is	so	constructed	that	such	wonders	as	we	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">seen	to-night	produce	very	little	effect	on	me.	They	are	as	normal	to	me	now	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 popping	 of	 corn	 or	 the	 roasting	 of	 potatoes.	 As	 I	 say,	 I	 have	 demonstrated certain	of	these	physical	doings.	But	as	for	belief—well,	that	is	not	a	matter	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	will,	but	of	evidence,	and	the	evidence	is	not	yet	sufficient	to	bring	me	to	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">definite	conclusion;	in	fact,	in	the	broad	day,	and	especially	the	second	day	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 have	 been	 through	 one	 of	 these	 astounding	 experiences,	 I	 begin	 to	 doubt	 my senses.	 Richet	 speaks	 of	 this	 curious	 recession	 of	 belief,	 and	 admits	 his	 own inability	 to	 retain	 the	 conviction	 that,	 at	 the	 moment	 of	 the	 phenomenon,	 was complete.	 'No	 sooner	 is	 the	 sitting	 over	 than	 my	 doubts	 come	 swarming	 back</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon	 me,'	 he	 says.	 'The	 real	 world	 which	 surrounds	 us,	 with	 its	 prejudices,	 its schemes	of	habitual	opinions,	holds	us	in	so	strong	a	grasp	that	we	can	scarcely</p>
<p class="calibre1">free	 ourselves	 completely.	 Certainty	 does	 not	 follow	 on	 demonstration,	 but	 on</p>
<p class="calibre1">habit.'	And	in	that	saying	you	have	my	own	mental	limitations	admirably	put." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller	 plodded	 along	 by	 my	 side	 in	 silence	 for	 a	 few	 minutes,	 and	 then	 asked, abruptly:	"What	is	the	real	reason	that	you	keep	up	the	fiction	of	the	'guide'	when you	don't	believe	in	him?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"For	the	reason	that	I	think	Mrs.	Smiley	honest	in	her	faith,	and	that	to	be	polite to	 the	 'guides'	 is	 one	 of	 the	 first	 requisites	 of	 a	 successful	 sitting.	 Suppose	 the whole	 action	 to	 be	 terrestrial.	 Suppose	 each	 successful	 sitting	 to	 be,	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Flammarion	 suggests,	 nothing	 but	 a	 subtle	 adjustment	 of	 our	 'collective</p>
<p class="calibre1">consciousness'	to	hers.	Can't	you	see	how	necessary	it	is	that	we	should	proceed</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	her	full	consent?	After	an	immense	experience,	following	closely	Crookes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">de	Rochas,	Lodge,	Richet,	Duclaux,	Lombroso,	and	Ochorowicz,	Maxwell	says:</p>
<p class="calibre1">'I	 believe	 in	 these	 phenomena,	 but	 I	 see	 no	 need	 to	 attribute	 them	 to	 any</p>
<p class="calibre1">supernatural	intervention.	I	am	inclined	to	think	they	are	produced	by	some	force</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>within	ourselves—'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just	what	does	he	mean	by	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	can't	precisely	explain.	It's	harder	to	understand	than	the	spirit	hypothesis.	He himself	admits	this,	and	goes	on	to	say	that	while	he	is	certain	that	we	are	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">presence	 of	 an	 unknown	 force,	 he	 is	 convinced	 that	 the	 phenomena	 will</p>
<p class="calibre1">ultimately	 be	 found	 orderly,	 like	 all	 other	 facts	 of	 nature.	 'Therefore,	 in	 the critical	 state	 of	 research,	 the	 scientific	 problem,	 it	 seems	 to	 me,	 is	 not	 whether spiritism	 be	 true	 or	 false,	 but	 whether	 metapsychical	 phenomena	 are	 real	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1">imaginary.	 Some	 future	 Newton	 will	 discover	 a	 more	 complete	 formula	 than</p>
<p class="calibre1">ours,'	 he	 prophesies.	 'Every	 natural	 fact	 should	 be	 studied,	 and	 if	 it	 be	 real, incorporated	 in	 the	 patrimony	 of	 knowledge.'	 He	 then	 adds,	 with	 the	 true</p>
<p class="calibre1">scientist's	 humble	 acknowledgment	 of	 the	 infinite	 reach	 of	 the	 undiscovered</p>
<p class="calibre1">universe:	'Our	knowledge	is	very	limited	and	our	experience	young.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	 is	 good	 talk,"	 said	 Miller	 in	 reply,	 "but	 the	 question	 is,	 Does	 he	 really experiment	in	that	condition	of	mind?	An	astronomer	with	his	eye	to	a	telescope</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	a	highly	specialized	and	competent	being.	An	astronomer	listening	to	whispers</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	dark	may	be	as	simple	and	credulous	as	a	child." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	grant	all	that.	But	I	see	in	it	the	greater	reason	why	men	like	yourself	should</p>
<p class="calibre1">take	 up	 the	 investigation	 of	 these	 illusive	 and	 disturbing	 problems.	 These</p>
<p class="calibre1">phenomena,	as	Flammarion	says,	introduce	us	into	uncharted	seas,	and	we	need</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	most	cautious	and	clearest-sighted	scientists	in	this	world	as	pilots.	Will	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	one	of	them?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	flatter	me.	As	a	matter	of	fact,	I'm	a	very	poor	sailor,"	he	answered,	with	a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a><b class="calibre3">IV</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">If	there	is	any	one	thing	true	in	these	manifestations	of	"spirit	power,"	it	is	that the	psychic	is	the	agent	for	their	production.	Actively	or	passively,	consciously</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	 unconsciously,	 she	 completes	 the	 formula—her	 "odic	 force"	 is	 the	 final chemical	 which	 permits	 precipitation.	 Sometimes	 her	 will	 to	 produce,	 her	 wish</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 serve,	 hinders	 rather	 than	 helps.	 Often	 when	 she	 is	 most	 persistent	 nothing happens.	 Sometimes	 an	 aching	 foot	 or	 a	 disturbing	 thought	 cuts	 off	 all</p>
<p class="calibre1">phenomena.	 For	 the	 best	 results,	 apparently,	 the	 psychic	 should	 be	 confident, </p>
<p class="calibre1">easy	of	mind,	and	not	too	anxious	to	please. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 approached	 this	 sitting	 at	 Miller's	 house	 with	 some	 fear	 that	 it	 might	 end	 in disappointment	to	him	and	be	a	source	of	chagrin	to	Mrs.	Smiley.	The	house	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">strange,	 our	 attitude	 intensely	 critical,	 and	 she	 was	 very	 anxious	 to	 succeed.	 It would	be	remarkable,	indeed,	if	under	these	conditions	she	were	able	to	meet	us</p>
<p class="calibre1">half-way.	As	we	walked	up	the	street	together	I	did	my	best	to	reassure	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	may	trust	me	fully,	Mrs.	Smiley,"	said	I;	"and	Miller,	though	an	inexorable scientist,	 is	 a	 gentleman.	 I	 am	 sure	 he	 will	 not	 insist	 on	 any	 experiment	 which will	injure	your	health	or	give	you	needless	pain.	This	is	but	our	second	sitting, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I,	for	one,	do	not	expect	you	to	be	at	your	best." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 <i class="calibre4">hope</i>	we	will	have	good	work,"	she	replied,	earnestly,	"but	it	is	always	harder to	sit	for	tests.	Tell	me	about	Mrs.	Miller.	Is	she	nice?	Will	I	like	her?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	is	very	gentle	and	considerate;	you	will	like	her	at	once.	I	am	sure	she	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	a	help	to	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	voice	was	very	sincere	as	she	said:	"You	don't	know	how	anxiously	I	watch</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	make-up	of	my	circle.	It	isn't	because	I	am	afraid	of	sceptics;	I	have	no	fear</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	those	who	do	not	believe;	but	each	person	brings	such	diverse	influences,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	 influences	 conflict	 and	 worry	 me,	 and	 then	 nothing	 takes	 place.	 I	 don't want	to	disappoint	you	and	your	friends,	and	that	may	hinder	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 Millers	 occupied	 a	 modest	 little	 house	 far	 up-town,	 and	 were	 suburban, </p>
<p class="calibre1">almost	rural,	in	their	manner	of	living.	The	chemist	himself	met	us	at	the	door, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and,	 after	 greeting	 us	 cordially,	 ushered	 us	 into	 his	 library,	 which	 was	 a	 small room	 at	 the	 back	 of	 the	 hall.	 I	 observed	 that	 it	 had	 only	 one	 door	 and	 two</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>windows,	rather	high	up	in	the	east	wall—an	excellent	place	for	our	sitting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	this	is	the	den	of	inquisition,"	I	began;	and	turning	to	Mrs.	Smiley,	I	added:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	hope	you	are	not	chilled	by	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	a	bit,"	she	answered,	cheerily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Mrs.	Miller,	a	quiet	little	woman	(not	so	far	removed	from	Mrs.	Smiley's	own</p>
<p class="calibre1">type),	 entered	 the	 door	 and	 greeted	 us	 both,	 the	 psychic's	 face	 lighted	 up	 with pleasure.	This	argued	well	for	our	experiment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 could	 see	 that	 Miller	 had	 made	 careful	 preparation	 along	 the	 lines	 of	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">suggestion.	A	plain	old	table	was	standing	lengthwise	of	the	room,	the	windows</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	hung	with	shawls,	and	a	worn	hickory	chair	stood	with	arms	wide-spread	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">seize	its	victim.	After	surveying	the	room,	Mrs.	Smiley	turned	to	me	with	a	note</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	satisfaction	in	her	voice,	and	said:	"I	like	this	room	and	this	furniture;	I	feel the	right	associations	here.	The	air	is	full	of	spirit	power." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	am	glad	your	mind	is	at	ease,"	said	I,	"for	I	am	anxious	for	a	very	conclusive sitting.	 You	 tell	 'Mitchell'	 that	 Miller	 is	 decidedly	 worth	 converting.	 I	 want</p>
<p class="calibre1">'Wilbur'	to	do	his	best,	for	I	intend	to	tighten	the	bonds	on	you	to-night." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	fearlessly	faced	me.	"I	am	in	your	hands,	Mr.	Garland;	do	as	you	like.	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mitchell	told	me	this	morning	that	he	would	yet	convince	you	of	the	reality	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 spirit	 world.	 He	 is	 assembling	 all	 the	 forces	 at	 his	 command,	 and	 will</p>
<p class="calibre1">certainly	do	everything	in	his	power." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	am	delighted	to	get	that	assurance,"	I	responded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	 are	 to	 sit	 here,"	 said	 Miller,	 indicating	 the	 hickory	 chair,	 which	 he	 had placed	near	the	north	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	took	her	seat	meekly,	placing	her	hands	resignedly	on	the	wings	of	the	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	like	this	chair,"	she	said,	with	a	smile;	"it	is	so	old-fashioned." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now,"	said	I,	"I	am	going	to	ask	Mrs.	Miller	to	fasten	this	long	tape	about	your ankles.	We	mean	to	take	every	precaution	in	order	that	you	may	not	involuntarily</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	subconsciously	move	your	limbs." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under	close	scrutiny,	Mrs.	Miller	secured	each	foot	in	such	wise	that	the	knots</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	in	the	middle	of	the	tape,	and	to	make	untying	them	absolutely	impossible, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	drew	the	two	ends	of	the	long	ribbon	back	under	the	psychic's	chair	and	tacked</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>them	 securely	 to	 the	 shelf	 of	 a	 bookcase	 about	 two	 feet	 from	 the	 hind	 legs.	 To loosen	them	was	entirely	out	of	our	victim's	power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller	then	unreeled	a	spool	of	silk	twist,	and	this	I	tied	squarely	to	the	arm	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	chair	at	a	point	about	six	feet	from	the	loose	end	which	I	intended	to	hold.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">knotted	the	silk	about	the	psychic's	wrists,	drawing	it	to	a	hard	knot	each	time, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	gave	the	spool	to	Miller,	while	retaining	the	loose	end	of	the	thread	in	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">own	hands.	The	psychic	could	neither	touch	the	tips	of	her	fingers	together	nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">lift	her	arms	an	inch	from	the	chair.	She	was	as	secure	as	if	bound	with	a	rope, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	as	an	extra	precaution	I	passed	the	thread	beneath	the	chair-arm	and	pulled	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">taut.	"This	will	enable	us	to	feel	the	lightest	movement	of	her	hands,"	I	said	to Miller,	who	had	copied	my	device.	"Are	you	satisfied	with	the	conditions?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	answered,	with	some	reservation:	"They	will	do.	I	would	like	to	have	light, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	that	I	suppose	is	impossible." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	not	impossible,"	replied	Mrs.	Smiley,	"but	the	work	is	always	weaker	in	the light;	the	voices	are	stronger	in	the	dark." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Miller	took	her	seat	exactly	opposite	Mrs.	Smiley.	I	was	at	her	right.	Miller, </p>
<p class="calibre1">after	turning	out	the	gas,	sat	opposite	me	and	at	the	psychic's	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	first	the	room	was	black	as	ink,	but	by	degrees	I	(from	my	position,	opposite</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	window)	was	able	to	perceive	a	faint	glow	of	light	through	the	curtain.	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Smiley's	 back	 was	 near	 a	 wall	 of	 books,	 and,	 the	 room	 being	 narrow,	 Miller's chair	 pretty	 well	 filled	 the	 space	 between	 the	 table	 and	 the	 window	 behind	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	action	of	a	confederate	was	excluded	by	reason	of	the	bolted	door.	To	enter</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	room	by	the	window	was	impossible,	for	the	reason	that	the	slightest	noise</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 be	 heard	 and	 the	 least	 movement	 of	 the	 curtain	 would	 admit	 the	 light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barring	the	darkness,	conditions	were	all	of	our	own	making. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,	 we	 were	 hardly	 settled	 in	 place	 when	 Miller	 was	 moved	 to	 further</p>
<p class="calibre1">precaution.	 "Mrs.	 Smiley,	 I	 would	 like	 to	 pin	 over	 your	 dress	 a	 newspaper,	 so that	 any	 slightest	 movement	 of	 your	 knees	 or	 feet	 could	 be	 heard.	 Do	 you</p>
<p class="calibre1">object?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	 at	 all,"	 she	 instantly	 replied.	 "I	 am	 sure	 my	 guides	 will	 do	 anything	 they can	to	meet	your	wishes.	You	may	nail	my	dress	to	the	floor	if	you	wish." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller	turned	on	the	light,	and	together	we	pinned	a	large,	crisp	newspaper	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 knees	 and	 tacked	 it	 securely	 to	 the	 floor	 in	 front	 of	 her	 feet.	 The	 corners</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>where	the	pins	were	inserted	were	well	out	of	the	reach	of	her	tethered	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again	the	lights	were	lowered,	and	at	my	direction	Miller	placed	his	right	hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 the	 psychic's	 left	 and	 touched	 fingers	 with	 Mrs.	 Miller.	 I	 did	 the	 same,	 thus connecting	the	circle.	In	this	way	we	sat	quietly	conversing	for	some	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 want	 to	 make	 it	 quite	 plain	 to	 you,"	 I	 said	 to	 them	 all,	 "that	 I	 am	 trying	 to follow	Crookes's	advice,	which	is	to	strip	away	all	romance	and	all	superstitious</p>
<p class="calibre1">religious	ideas	from	this	subject.	I	am	insisting	on	the	normal	character	of	these</p>
<p class="calibre1">phenomena.	Whatever	happens	to-night,	Mrs.	Miller,	please	do	not	be	alarmed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 is	 nothing	 inherently	 uncanny	 or	 unwholesome	 in	 these	 phenomena.	 No</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	 knows	 better	 than	 your	 husband	 the	 essential	 mystery	 of	 the	 simplest	 fact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Materialization,	 for	 example,	 is	 unusual;	 but	 if	 it	 happens	 it	 cannot	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">supernatural.	Nothing	is	supernatural.	Am	I	right,	Miller?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	explain	each	mystery	by	a	deeper	mystery,"	he	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	depends	upon	the	point	of	view.	I	am	interested	in	these	obscure	phases	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">human	life.	If	they	are	real	they	are	natural.	To	me	the	spiritistic	'demonstrations' </p>
<p class="calibre1">are	intensely	human	and	absorbingly	interesting	as	dramatic	material,	and	yet	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">hope	 I	 am	 sufficiently	 the	 scientist	 to	 be	 alive	 to	 the	 significance	 of	 these telekinetic	happenings,	and	enough	of	the	realist	to	remain	critical	in	the	midst	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	wildest	carnival	of	the	invisible	forces." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	 you	 believe	 in	 them?"	 asked	 Mrs.	 Miller,	 with	 a	 note	 of	 surprise	 in	 her voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 replied,	 cautiously:	 "I	 am	 at	 this	 moment	 convinced	 of	 the	 reality	 of	  <i class="calibre4">some</i>	 of these	 phenomena	 by	 reason	 of	 my	 own	 experiments;	 but	 leaving	 one	 side	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">personal	 investigation,	 I	 must	 believe	 that	 Crookes,	 Maxwell,	 and	 Flammarion</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	competent	witnesses.	As	to	spiritualism—well,	that	is	another	matter." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	where	does	all	this	lead	to	if	not	to	spiritualism?"	asked	Mrs.	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As	 to	 the	 exact	 country,	 no	 one	 knows,"	 I	 answered;	 "but	 the	 best	 of	 our experimenters	are	agreed	that	the	gate	opens	upon	a	new	field	of	science.	These</p>
<p class="calibre1">powers	seem	to	be	in	advance	of	us	and	not	a	survival,	and	they	may	prove	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">value	 in	 the	 evolution	 of	 the	 race.	 That	 is	 why	 I	 want	 to	 enlist	 men	 like	 your husband	 in	 the	 work.	 Mediumship	 needs	 just	 such	 critical	 attention	 as	 his. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing	like	Maxwell	or	Richet's	thoroughness	of	method	has	ever	been	used	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	American	physicist,	so	far	as	I	know.	On	the	contrary,	our	leading	scientific</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>men	seem	to	have	let	the	subject	severely	alone." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why?"	asked	Mrs.	Smiley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Partly	because	of	 inherited	prejudice,	and	 partly	because	of	 their	allegiance	to opposing	 theories;	 and	 finally,	 I	 suspect,	 because	 they	 are	 connected	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">institutions	 that	 would	 not	 sanction	 such	 work.	 You	 can	 imagine	 how	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">physical	 department	 of	 a	 denominational	 college	 would	 investigate	 spirit</p>
<p class="calibre1">phenomena!	It	was	much	the	same	way	in	England	during	the	early	part	of	last</p>
<p class="calibre1">century,	but	they	are	far	in	advance	of	us	now.	The	first	notable	step	in	the	right</p>
<p class="calibre1">direction	 was	 taken—as	 perhaps	 you	 may	 know—in	 1869,	 by	 the	 Dialectical</p>
<p class="calibre1">Society	 of	 London,	 which	 appointed	 a	 committee	 to	 look	 into	 the	 subject	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">spiritualism,	with	the	expectation,	no	doubt,	of	being	able	to	stop	the	spread	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	delusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 investigations	 which	 followed	 were	 under	 the	 especial	 charge	 of	 Alfred Russel	 Wallace;	 Cromwell	 Varley,	 chief	 of	 Electrical	 Engineers	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Telegraphers;	and	Professor	Morgan,	president	of	the	Mathematical	Society.	This</p>
<p class="calibre1">committee,	after	careful	investigation,	reported	voluminously	to	this	effect:	'The</p>
<p class="calibre1">phenomena	 exist....	 There	 is	 a	 force	 capable	 of	 moving	 heavy	 bodies	 without</p>
<p class="calibre1">material	 contact,	 which	 force	 is	 in	 some	 unknown	 way	 dependent	 upon	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">presence	of	human	beings.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Which	was	a	long	way	from	saying	that	spiritism	was	true,"	remarked	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	certainly	was	sufficiently	vague,	you	would	think,	to	be	harmless;	but	several</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 committee	 refused	 to	 join	 in	 even	 this	 cautious	 report,	 insisting	 that	 the conclusions	 ought	 to	 be	 verified	 by	 some	 other	 scientist.	 They	 suggested	 Sir</p>
<p class="calibre1">William	 Crookes,	 who	 was	 at	 this	 time	 in	 the	 early	 prime	 of	 his	 life	 and	 a renowned	chemist—just	the	man	for	the	work.	This	suggestion	was	acted	upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	Crookes	a	little	later,	and	his	report	on	this	'psychic	force'	had	a	good	deal	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	with	the	formation	of	the	now	famous	Society	for	Psychical	Research." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'd	hate	to	be	held	responsible	for	that,"	said	Miller,	with	humorous	intent—"of all	the	collections	of	'hants'	and	witches." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"On	 the	 Continent	 scientific	 observation	 had	 already	 begun.	 Count	 Agénor	 de Gasparin,	 of	 Valleyeres,	 was	 one	 of	 the	 first	 to	 take	 up	 this	 problem	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">telekinesis	in	the	modern	spirit.	He	made	a	long	and	complicated	study	of	table-</p>
<p class="calibre1">tipping	 in	 1853,	 and	 published	 his	 conclusions	 in	 two	 large	 volumes	 in	 Paris	 a year	 later.	 His	 experiments	 were	 careful	 and	 searching,	 and	 drew	 the	 line</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>squarely	 between	 the	 supernatural	 and	 the	 natural.	 He	 said,	 positively,	 'The agency	 is	 not	 supernatural;	 it	 is	 physical,	 and	 determined	 by	 the	 will	 of	 the sitters,'	 and	 may	 be	 called	 the	 Charles	 Darwin	 of	 the	 subject.	 A	 year	 later Professor	 Marc	 Thury,	 of	 Geneva,	 added	 his	 testimony.	 He	 also	 said:	 'The</p>
<p class="calibre1">phenomena	 exist,	 and	 are	 mainly	 due	 to	 an	 unknown	 fluid,	 or	 force,	 which</p>
<p class="calibre1">rushes	 from	 the	 organism	 of	 certain	 people.'	 To	 this	 force	 he	 gave	 the	 name</p>
<p class="calibre1">'psyscode.'	The	spirit	hypothesis,	he	was	inclined	to	think,	was	not	impossible	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">even	absurd.	He	used	 <i class="calibre4">absurd</i>	in	the	scientific	sense,	of	course." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	is	the	most	natural	thing	in	the	world	to	me,"	said	Mrs.	Smiley.	"I	would	be desolate	without	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Some	ten	years	later	Flammarion,	the	renowned	French	astronomer,	began	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">studies	 of	 these	 unknown	 forces,	 and	 for	 a	 long	 time	 fought	 the	 battle	 alone	 in France	as	Sir	William	Crookes	endured	the	brunt	of	the	assault	in	England." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller	here	interposed	with	a	covert	sneer	in	his	voice:	"Yes,	but	Flammarion	has</p>
<p class="calibre1">always	 had	 the	 reputation	 of	 being	 more	 of	 the	 romancer	 than	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">astronomer." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	 scientists	 do	 him	 an	 injustice,"	 I	 answered,	 with	 some	 heat,	 "just	 as	 you have	all	been	ignorantly	contemptuous	of	Crookes.	I	confess	I	used	to	share	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	 small	 degree	 your	 estimate	 of	 Flammarion;	 but	 if	 you	 will	 read	 his	 latest book	with	attention	and	with	candor,	you	cannot	but	be	impressed	with	his	wide</p>
<p class="calibre1">experience	and	his	patient,	persistent	search	for	the	truth.	I	am	persuaded	that	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">has	been	a	genuine	pioneer	all	along.	I	cannot	see	but	that	he	has	examined	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">critically	 the	 scores	 of	 psychics	 who	 have	 come	 under	 his	 observation,	 and	 his reports	 are	 painstaking	 and	 cautious.	 His	 work	 must	 be	 considered	 by	 every</p>
<p class="calibre1">student	of	this	subject.	It	won't	do	to	neglect	the	words	of	a	man	who	has	seen	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">much.—But	here	we	go	along	lines	of	controversy	when	we	should	be	sitting	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">quiet	harmony.	Let	us	defer	our	discussion	until	after	our	séance.	Have	patience, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 I	 believe	 we	 can	 duplicate,	 if	 not	 surpass,	 the	 marvellous	 doings	 of	 even Richet	and	Lombroso.	We	may	be	able	some	day	to	take	flash-light	photographs</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	cone	while	it	is	floating	in	the	air." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Has	that	ever	been	done?"	asked	Mrs.	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh	yes;	Flammarion	secured	photos	of	a	table	floating	in	the	air.	These	pictures</p>
<p class="calibre1">show	conclusively	that	the	psychic	had	nothing	to	do	with	it—at	least,	not	in	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">ordinary	way.	Richet	succeeded	in	fixing	the	apparition	of	a	helmeted	soldier	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">several	 plates.	 Crookes	 photographed	 'Katie	 King'	 and	 her	 medium	 once	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a>twice,	 and	 Fontenay	 has	 succeeded	 in	 getting	 clear-cut	 images	 of	 the	 'spirit' </p>
<p class="calibre1">hands	 which	 play	 round	 the	 head	 of	 Paladino.	 But	 it	 must	 be	 confessed	 that	 in Crookes's	pictures	there	is	a	lack	of	finality	in	the	negatives.	He	never	succeeded</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	getting	the	faces	of	both	'Katie'	and	Miss	Cook	at	the	same	time—and	Richet's</p>
<p class="calibre1">photographs	have	a	made-up	look." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Passing	abruptly	to	a	low,	humming	song,	I	made	the	attempt	to	put	our	psychic</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	sleep.	In	a	few	minutes	her	hands	became	cold	and	began	to	flutter.	At	last	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">threw	 my	 fingers	 away	 as	 if	 she	 found	 them	 scorching	 hot.	 Miller's	 hand	 was similarly	 repulsed.	 She	 then	 seemed	 to	 pass	 into	 quiet	 sleep,	 and	 I	 said:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Withdraw	a	little,	Miller,	but	keep	your	silk	thread	taut." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Almost	immediately	faint	raps	came	upon	the	table,	and	I	asked:	"Are	you	there, </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Mitchell'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tap,	tap,	tap—"  <i class="calibre4">Yes. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are	we	sitting	right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tap,	tap,	tap—"  <i class="calibre4">Yes</i>,"	answered	the	force,	in	a	grave	and	deliberate	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As	 to	 these	 raps,"	 I	 remarked,	 "they	 are	 easily	 simulated,	 but	 they	 have	 been absolutely	proven	by	several	of	our	best	investigators.	They	have	been	obtained</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 a	 sheet	 of	 paper	 held	 in	 the	 air,	 on	 pencils,	 on	 a	 strip	 of	 cloth,	 on	 an	 open umbrella—under	 every	 possible	 condition.	 Maxwell	 secured	 them	 by	 pinching</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 own	 ear	 or	 by	 squeezing	 the	 arm	 of	 his	 neighbor.	 I	 have	 heard	 them	 on	 a man's	shirt-front.	They	are	the	first	manifestations	of	intelligent	spirit	power,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">may	be	regarded	in	the	light	of	established	fact." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	wouldn't	be	hasty	about	admitting	even	that,"	remarked	Miller.	"In	the	dark—</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	in	the	light—these	obscure	sounds	may	seem	very	ghostly,	and	yet	be	due	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">purely	physical	causes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	sat	in	silence	for	a	few	moments,	and	at	last	I	asked:	"Is	any	spirit	present?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Almost	 immediately	 a	 childish	 voice	 came	 from	 the	 direction	 of	 the	 psychic, </p>
<p class="calibre1">apparently	 issuing	 from	 her	 lips.	 "  <i class="calibre4">Mr.	 Mitchell	 would	 like	 to	 have	 you	 tie	 the</i> <i class="calibre4">threads	to	the	legs	of	the	table. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are	you	'Maud?'"	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">Yes,	I	am	Maudie</i>,"	she	answered.	"  <i class="calibre4">Mr.	Mitchell	wants	to	try	some	experiment. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a> <i class="calibre4">He	wishes	you	to	tie	the	threads	to	the	legs	of	the	table. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 confess	 I	 didn't	 like	 the	 looks	 of	 this,	 but	 as	 a	 compromise	 measure	 I	 was willing	to	grant	it.	"If	you	don't	object,	Miller,	we	will	do	as	the	guides	desire." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	hesitated.	"It	weakens	our	test.	I	don't	understand	the	reason	for	the	demand." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 suggest	 we	 yield	 the	 point	 for	 the	 present.	 Perhaps	 'they'	 will	 permit	 us	 to resume	 the	 thread	 a	 little	 later.	 I	 have	 found	 that	 by	 apparently	 meeting	 the forces	half-way	at	the	beginning	we	often	get	concessions	later	which	will	be	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">greater	value	than	the	tests	we	have	ourselves	devised." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Accordingly,	I	tied	my	end	of	the	silk	twist	to	the	table	leg	at	a	distance	of	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">twenty-six	 inches	 from	 the	 utmost	 reach	 of	 the	 psychic's	 hands.	 Miller	 did	 the same	with	his	end.	We	then	resumed	our	seats,	and	waited	for	over	an	hour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During	this	time	the	psychic	was	absolutely	silent	and	apparently	in	deep	trance, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I	was	beginning	to	feel	both	disappointed	and	chagrined.	Miller's	tone	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bit	irritating.	I	knew	exactly	what	was	in	his	mind.	"I've	fixed	her	now,"	he	was exultantly	saying	to	himself.	"She	can't	do	a	thing;	even	her	request	to	have	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">threads	tied	to	the	table	does	not	avail	her.	Accustomed	to	have	everything	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">own	way,	she	fails	the	first	time	any	real	restraint	is	applied	to	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	quite	at	the	end	of	my	confident	expectancy,	when	the	psychic	began	to	stir</p>
<p class="calibre1">uneasily	 and	 "Maudie"	 spoke	 complaining	 of	 the	 thread	 on	 her	 mother's	 right wrist.	"  <i class="calibre4">It's	so	tight	it	stops	the	blood</i>,"	she	said.	"  <i class="calibre4">Please	loosen	the	thread	a	little. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">You	may	turn	up	the	light</i>,"	added	the	little	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	Miller	gave	me	a	light,	I	loosened	the	thread	on	her	right	wrist,	which	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	 tight;	 but	 I	 tied	 a	 second	 thread	 about	 her	 arm	 in	 such	 wise	 that	 I	 would surely	 know	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 sitting	 if	 it	 had	 been	 disturbed.	 The	 table,	 I observed	 at	 the	 time,	 was	 more	 than	 two	 feet	 from	 her	 finger-tips.	 I	 called Miller's	attention	to	this,	and	said:	"She	can't	possibly	untie	these	threads,	and	if she	breaks	them	the	sitting	is	invalidated." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon	 after	 the	 light	 was	 turned	 out	 "Maudie"	 requested	 that	 we	 all	 move	 away from	 Mrs.	 Smiley,	 down	 to	 the	 lower	 end	 of	 the	 table;	 and	 although	 Miller</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought	 this	 permitted	 too	 much	 liberty	 of	 action	 on	 the	 part	 of	 the	 medium,	 I urged	consent.	"There	are	other	sittings	coming,"	I	repeated	once	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	 Smiley	 fell	 again	 into	 deep	 sleep,	 but	 nothing	 took	 place	 for	 a	 long	 time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During	this	period	of	waiting	I	told	stories	of	my	experience	and	the	curious	folk</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>I	had	met	in	search	for	the	true	explanation	of	these	singular	phenomena. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Have	you	ever	witnessed	any	materializations?"	asked	Mrs.	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes;	but	none	of	it	was	of	the	sort	that	I	could	swear	to.	I	mean	that	it	seemed	to me	 to	 be	 either	 downright	 trickery	 or	 subconscious	 actions	 on	 the	 part	 of	 the psychic,	and	yet	I've	seen	some	very	puzzling	phantoms.	I	am	persuaded	that	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">great	deal	of	what	is	called	'fraud'	arises	from	the	suggestibility	of	the	psychics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lombroso	speaks	of	this	'fixed	idea'	of	the	mediums,	and	their	persistent,	almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">insane,	 attempt	 to	 produce	 the	 phenomena	 desired	 by	 the	 circle.	 You	 can</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand	how	this	would	be	if	there	is	anything	at	all	in	hypnotism.	Sometimes</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 all	 seems	 to	 belong	 to	 the	 realm	 of	 hypnotic	 visions.	 One	 medium	 helps</p>
<p class="calibre1">another	 to	 build	 up	 this	 unreal	 world.	 Early	 in	 my	 career	 as	 an	 investigator	 I went	to	Onset	Bay,	where	in	July	of	each	year	all	the	spiritualists	and	'mejums'	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">New	 England	 used	 to	 gather	 (do	 yet,	 I	 believe),	 and	 I	 shall	 never	 forget	 the singular	 assemblage	 of	 'slate-writers,'	 'spirit	 artists,'	 'spirit	 photographers,' </p>
<p class="calibre1">'palmists,'	and	'psychometrists'	whose	signs	lined	the	street	and	pointed	along	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">paths	of	the	camp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In	its	way	it	was	as	dramatic	a	contrast	of	light	and	shade,	of	the	real	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">unreal,	 as	 this	 otherwise	 prosaic	 republic	 can	 show.	 There	 under	 the	 vivid</p>
<p class="calibre1">summer	sun,	beside	the	glittering	sea,	men	and	women	met	to	commune	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">incommunicable,	to	question	the	voiceless,	and	to	embrace	the	intangible.	It	was, </p>
<p class="calibre1">indeed,	such	a	revelation	of	human	credulity	as	might	well	have	overpowered	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">young	 novelist.	 From	 the	 warm,	 pine-scented	 afternoon	 air	 I	 crept	 into	 one	 of these	tiny	cabins,	and	sat	with	my	hands	upon	a	closed	slate	in	order	to	receive	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">message	from	Lincoln	or	Cæsar;	I	slipped	beneath	the	shelter	of	a	tent	to	have	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sealed	 letter	 read	 by	 a	 commonplace	 person	 with	 an	 Indian	 accent;	 and	 I	 sat	 at night	in	dark	little	parlors	to	watch	weak	men	and	weeping	women	embrace	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">badly	designed	effigies	of	their	lost	darlings." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Isn't	 it	 incredible?	 Can	 you	 imagine	 any	 reasonable	 person	 believing	 such things?"	asked	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Millions	do,"	I	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Please	go	on,"	entreated	Mrs.	Miller.	"What	happened	to	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothing	really	worth	reporting	upon.	In	that	day	of	utter	credulity	no	tests	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible,	 but	 immediately	 after	 my	 return	 to	 Boston	 I	 had	 my	 first	 entirely</p>
<p class="calibre1">satisfactory	test	of	the	occult.	I	went	with	Mrs.	Rose,	one	of	our	members,	to	sit</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>for	 'independent	 slate-writing'—that	 is	 to	 say,	 writing	 on	 the	 inner	 surfaces	 of closed	 slates.	 Up	 to	 this	 moment	 I	 was	 profoundly	 sceptical,	 but	 I	 could	 not doubt	the	reality	of	what	happened.	I	took	my	own	slates—the	ordinary	hinged</p>
<p class="calibre1">school	 slates;	 but	 whether	 they	 were	 my	 own	 or	 not	 made	 no	 difference	 really, for	 the	 final	 test	 which	 I	 demanded	 was	 such	 that	 any	 prepared	 slates	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">useless.	 I'm	 not	 going	 into	 tiresome	 detail.	 I	 only	 say	 that	 while	 sitting	 at	 the table	with	both	Mrs.	Rose's	hands	and	my	own	resting	upon	the	slates	 <i class="calibre4">I	dictated</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">certain	lines	to	be	drawn	upon	the	inside	of	the	slates." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller's	voice	expressed	growing	interest.	"And	this	was	done?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	was	done.	I	had	in	mind	the	test	which	Alfred	Russel	Wallace	had	used	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">similar	 case.	 He	 dictated	 several	 words	 to	 be	 written	 while	 holding	 the	 slates securely	in	his	own	hands.	In	this	instance	I	asked	for	the	word	'Constantinople' </p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 be	 written.	 The	 psychic	 smiled,	 shrugged	 her	 shoulders,	 and	 replied:	 'I'll	 try, but	 I	 don't	 believe	 they	 can	 spell	 it.'	 'Draw	 a	 straight	 line,	 then,'	 said	 I.	 'I'll	 be content	with	a	single	line	an	inch	long.'	She	laughingly	retorted:	'It's	hard	to	draw</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	straight	line.'	'Very	well,	draw	a	crooked	line.	Draw	a	zigzag—like	a	stroke	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">lightning.	Draw	it	in	yellow.	Draw	a	circle.'	She	said	no	more,	but	became	silent, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 we	 waited	 without	 change	 of	 position.	 Remember	 that	 I	 was	 holding	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">slate	during	all	this	talk.	It	did	not	leave	my	hands." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	were	the	conditions?	Was	it	light?"	asked	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	was	about	two	o'clock	of	an	afternoon,	and	we	sat	in	the	bay-window	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">parlor.	It	was	perfectly	light.	No	one	moved.	The	psychic	sat	opposite	us,	leaning</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	in	a	thoughtful	pose.	Her	hands	lay	in	her	lap,	and	she	seemed	to	be	merely</p>
<p class="calibre1">waiting.	At	last	a	tapping	came	upon	the	slate,	and	she	brightened	up.	'It	is	done!' </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 called,	 exultingly.	 I	 opened	 the	 slates	 myself,	 and	  <i class="calibre4">there,	 drawn	 in	 yellow</i> <i class="calibre4">crayon,	was	a	small	circle	with	a	zigzag	yellow	line	crossing	it	exactly	as	I	had</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">dictated</i>,	 and	 under	 Mrs.	 Rose's	 hands	 in	 the	 corner	 of	 the	 slate	 was	 a	 gayly colored	 bunch	 of	 pansies.	 There	 were	 messages	 also,	 but	 I	 paid	 very	 little</p>
<p class="calibre1">attention	 to	 them.	 The	 production	 of	 that	 circle	 under	 those	 conditions</p>
<p class="calibre1">overshadowed	 everything	 else.	 It	 was	 a	 definite	 and	 complete	 answer	 to	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">doubt.	 It	 was,	 in	 fact,	 a	 'miracle.'	 I	 recall	 going	 directly	 to	 a	 meeting	 of	 the society	 and	 reporting	 upon	 this	 sitting.	 You	 will	 find	 the	 bald	 statement	 of	 my experiment	in	the	minutes	of	the	secretary." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller	 was	 silent	 for	 a	 moment,	 then	 asked:	 "You're	 sure	 it	 was	 done	 after	 you took	the	slates	in	hand?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p63"></a>"I	am	as	certain	of	it	as	I	am	of	anything." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	do	you	account	for	it?	Of	course	it	was	a	trick." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Trickery	 can't	 account	 for	 that	 yellow	 line.	 The	 messages	 could	 have	 been written	 beforehand,	 but	 no	 trick	 of	 prepared	 slates	 can	 account	 for	 my	 dictated design.	 I	 have	 had	 other	 cases	 of	 slate-writing	 which	 were	 almost	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">inexplicable,	and	Crookes	and	Wallace	and	Zöllner,	as	you	remember,	were	quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">convinced	 by	 evidence	 thus	 secured.	 Crookes	  <i class="calibre4">saw</i>	 the	 pencil	 at	 work.	 I	 have never	 witnessed	 the	 writing,	 but	 I	 have	 heard	 it	 at	 work	 under	 my	 hands	 and	 I have	felt	it	under	my	feet.	I	have	had	writing	on	ten	separate	pages	in	a	closed</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manila-pad	held	between	my	hands." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>Miller	 seemed	 to	 be	 impressed	 by	 these	 statements.	 "I	 have	 always	 considered slate-writing	 a	 cheap	 trick,	 but	 I	 don't	 quite	 see	 how	 that	 was	 done—always</p>
<p class="calibre1">providing	your	memory	is	not	at	fault." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 would	 not	 place	 much	 dependence	 on	 my	 present	 recollection,"	 I	 frankly responded,	"but	I	reported	on	the	case	at	once	while	my	mind	was	most	accurate</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	to	details.	Speaking	further	of	these	tricks,	if	you	choose	to	call	them	such,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	had	several	failures,	where	the	failure	meant	as	much	as	a	success.	I	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">held	two	slates	with	a	psychic	(while	we	were	both	standing)	when	the	creaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	scratching	and	grinding	went	on	between	my	hands.	I	give	you	my	word	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 convinced	 at	 the	 moment	 of	 holding	 between	 my	 palms	 a	 sentient	 force.	 I felt	as	Franklin	must	have	felt	when	he	played	with	the	lightning	in	the	bottle	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	tail	of	his	kite.	Once	I	heard	the	writing	going	on	in	a	half-opened	slate,	but	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">did	not	see	the	pencil	in	motion.	Some	of	these	cases	of	'direct-writing'	are	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">most	convincing	of	all	my	experiences.	People	ask	me	why	I	didn't	talk	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">spirits	about	heaven	and	angels.	I	was	not	interested	in	their	religious	notions.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">kept	 to	 this	 one	 line—I	 wanted	 to	 see	 a	 particle	 of	 matter	 move	 from	 A	 to	 B</p>
<p class="calibre1">without	a	known	push	or	pull.	I	paid	very	little	attention	to	'trance-mediums'	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Piper;	and	although	I	saw	a	great	deal	of	what	is	called	'mind-reading'	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">'thought-transference,'	 I	 did	 not	 permit	 the	 cart	 to	 get	 before	 the	 horse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Independent	 slate-writing'	 interested	 me,	 for	 the	 reason	 that	 I	 could	 put	 the clamps	on	it.	Materialization,	on	the	contrary,	is	so	staged	and	arranged	for	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 prove	 its	 genuineness	 seems	 impossible	 at	 present;	 but	 slate-writing	 under</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	hand	is	a	different	matter." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'd	like	to	have	it	under	 <i class="calibre4">my</i>	hand,"	said	Miller,	grimly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	can	have	it	if	you'll	go	after	it,"	I	retorted,	"and	you	can	have	it	hard." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Miller	was	deeply	interested.	"Tell	us	more.	Have	you	had	other	messages</p>
<p class="calibre1">written	in	that	wonderful	way?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	many	of	them.	One	of	the	most	curious	examples	of	this	kind	I	have	ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">seen	came	to	me	in	Chicago.	It	was	a	'new	one,'	as	Howard	would	say.	Old	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">MacVicker	told	me	one	day	that	there	was	a	woman	on	the	West	Side	who	had	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">trick	 of	 producing	 independent	 slate-writing	 beneath	 the	 stem	 of	 a	 goblet	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">water—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why	under	a	goblet	of	water?"	interrupted	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a>"As	a	test.	You	see,	nearly	every	one	who	goes	to	a	psychic	wants	first	of	all	to witness	a	miracle.	 Each	seeker	demands	 that	his	particular	 message	shall	 come</p>
<p class="calibre1">hard—that	is	to	say,	under	conditions	impossible	to	the	living.	His	reasoning	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	this:	'The	dead	are	free	from	the	limitations	of	our	life,	therefore	they	should</p>
<p class="calibre1">manifest	 themselves	 to	 us	 as	 befits	 their	 wider	 knowledge	 of	 the	 laws	 of	 the universe,	 and	 especially	 is	 it	 their	 business	 to	 outdo	 the	 most	 skilful	 conjurer! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence	 each	 man	 insists	 on	 locked	 slates	 and	 sealed	 letters.	 These	 the	 poor</p>
<p class="calibre1">psychics	 are	 forced	 to	 grant.	 To	 be	 just	 to	 them,	 I	 must	 say	 that	 I	 have	 found most	mediums	fairly	willing	to	meet	any	reasonable	test;	in	fact,	many	of	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">seem	perfectly	confident	of	the	inscrutable,	and	venture	upon	what	seems	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 impossible	 with	 amazing	 imperturbability.	 All	 they	 ask	 is	 to	 be	 treated	 like human	 beings.	 They	 are	 seldom	 afraid	 of	 results.	 Sometimes	 they	 bully	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">forces	sadly,	and	make	them	work	when	they	don't	want	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	 this	 particular	 psychic	 ushered	 me	 into	 her	 back	 parlor	 (which	 was flooded	with	sunlight),	and	asked	me	to	be	seated	at	a	small	table	covered	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">strip	of	cloth.	She	was	a	comfortable,	plump	person,	evidently	from	Kansas,	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">manner	 somewhat	 like	 the	 humorous	 wife	 of	 a	 prosperous	 village	 carpenter.	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">remember	that	we	were	rather	sympathetic	on	various	political	questions.	After</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	 remarks	 on	 populism	 and	 other	 weighty	 matters,	 she	 filled	 a	 goblet	 with water,	and,	placing	it	upon	a	slate,	passed	it	under	the	table	with	her	right	hand, </p>
<p class="calibre1">asking	me	to	put	my	hand	beneath	hers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	 it	 is!"	 said	 Miller,	 with	 infinite	 scorn.	 "Always	 in	 the	 dark	 or	 under	 the table.	No	wonder	Emerson	called	it	'a	rat-hole	philosophy.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Suppose	it's	all	the	work	of	an	'astral'	who	can't	abide	the	light?"	I	suggested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	know	the	theory,	but	I	can't	allow	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why	not?	You	permit	the	photographer	his	dark-room." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	with	malicious	delight	in	his	petulance,	I	calmly	continued:	"I	put	my	left</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand	beneath	hers	and	my	right	upon	the	table.	I	could	see	her	left	hand	lying	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	lap,	and	as	she	turned	sidewise	to	the	table	I	was	able	to	keep	in	view	both	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	feet.	We	held	the	slate	so	that	the	top	of	the	goblet	lightly	touched	the	under</p>
<p class="calibre1">side	of	the	stand.	The	psychic	was	all	accounted	for,	except	the	hand	which	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">resting	outspread	on	the	under	side	of	the	slate.	We	sat	for	several	minutes	in	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">way,	 while	 she	 explained	 that	 'they'	 would	 probably	 take	 words	 out	 of	 our</p>
<p class="calibre1">conversation	 as	 a	 test,	 if	 I	 desired	 it.	 'I	 am	 here	 to	 be	 shown,'	 I	 replied.	 She laughed	at	me,	and	on	two	different	occasions	brought	the	slate	from	beneath	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>table	with	writing	under	the	stem	of	the	goblet.	This	was	all	very	well,	but	I	said:</p>
<p class="calibre1">'A	better	test	would	be	to	have	them	write	words	that	I	dictate.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'I	will	ask	them,'	she	said.	She	seemed	to	listen	as	if	to	voices	inaudible	to	me, and	at	last	said:	'They	will	try	it.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Again	 we	 placed	 the	 goblet	 of	 water	 on	 the	 clean	 slate	 under	 the	 table,	 and while	 holding	 it	 as	 before,	 I	 said:	 'Now	 ask	 them	 to	 write	 the	 name	 "William Dean	Howells."' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Almost	 immediately	 there	 was	 a	 decided	 movement	 of	 the	 slate—or	 so	 it</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	to	me.	A	power	seemed	to	wake	on	the	slate,	not	through	the	psychic's</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand,	but	independent	of	it.	I	heard	plainly	the	scratching	of	a	pencil,	at	the	same</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	that	the	psychic's	left	hand	and	both	of	her	feet	were	in	full	view,	and	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same	 time	 that	 her	 hand	 was	 outspread,	 apparently	 motionless,	 upon	 the	 under</p>
<p class="calibre1">side	of	the	slate.	In	a	few	moments	the	scratching	paused,	and	the	psychic,	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	embarrassed	smile,	said:	'They	don't	know	how	to	spell	the	middle	name.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	is	to	say,  <i class="calibre4">she</i>	was	the	one	who	could	not	spell	the	name,"	said	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	 what	 I	 thought	 at	 the	 time,	 but	 I	 helped	 her	 out,	 and	 a	 moment	 later	 a decided	tapping	on	the	top	of	the	table	announced	the	completion	of	the	task. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As	 she	 slowly	 drew	 the	 slate	 out	 from	 under	 the	 table	 I	 was	 alert	 to	 see	 what had	happened.	The	glass	remained	in	the	middle	of	the	slate	as	before,	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">water	undiminished,	and	under	the	glass	and	confining	itself	to	the	circle	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">stem	were	the	words:</p>
<p class="calibre1">William	Dean	Howells</p>
<p class="calibre1">written	 as	 though	 acknowledging	 the	 barrier	 of	 the	 glass	 where	 its	 edge	 rested upon	the	slate." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wonderful!"	exclaimed	Mrs.	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are	you	sure	the	writing	was	there	as	she	drew	the	slate	out?"	queried	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	I	saw	the	writing	as	she	was	removing	the	goblet;	and	while	with	her	left</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand	she	drew	a	little	circle	around	the	outer	edge	of	the	stem	I	read	the	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	to	say	that	the	psychic	wrote	this	with	her	finger-nail	on	the	bottom	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">slate	and	then	turned	the	slate	over	is	to	me	absurd.	The	glass	of	water	prevented</p>
<p class="calibre1">that.	And	yet	she	did	it	in	some	occult	way.	The	transaction	remains	unexplained</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a>to	 me.	 I	 am	 perfectly	 sure	 she	 willed	 it,	 but	  <i class="calibre4">how</i>	 she	 caused	 the	 writing—the physical	change—is	quite	another	problem.	Zöllner	(I	believe	it	was)	secured	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">print	of	feet	on	the	inside	of	a	closed	slate,	and	reasoned	that	only	on	the	theory</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	a	fourth	dimension	could	such	phenomena	be	explained.	That	reminds	me	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sitting	 I	 once	 had	 with	 a	 young	 man	 wherein,	 to	 utterly	 confound	 us,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">invisible	hands	removed	his	undershirt	while	his	coat-sleeves	were	nailed	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">chair." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	come	now,	you	don't	expect	us	to	believe	a	miracle	like	that,	even	on	your</p>
<p class="calibre1">serious	statement?"	remarked	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 certainly	 do	 not,"	 I	 responded,	 readily.	 "I	 wouldn't	 believe	 it	 on	 any	 one's statement.	 That	 is	 the	 discouraging	 thing	 about	 this	 whole	 business;	 you	 can't convince	 any	 one	 by	 any	 amount	 of	 evidence.	 A	 man	 will	 stand	 out	 against</p>
<p class="calibre1">Zöllner,	 Crookes,	 Lodge,	 and	 Myers,	 discounting	 all	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 great</p>
<p class="calibre1">investigators,	 and	 then	 crumple	 up	 like	 a	 caterpillar	 at	 the	 first	 touch	 of	 The Invisible	Hand	when	it	comes	to	him	directly.	This	same	young	man	gave	me	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">most	 convincing	 demonstrations	 of	 materialized	 forms	 I	 have	 ever	 seen.	 In	 his own	little	home,	under	the	simplest	conditions,	he	commanded	forth	from	a	little</p>
<p class="calibre1">bedroom	 a	 figure	 which	 was	 unmistakably	 not	 a	 mechanism.	 A	 lamp	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">burning	 in	 the	 room,	 and	 the	 young	 fellow	 was	 perfectly	 visible	 at	 the	 same moment	as	the	phantom	which	stood	and	bowed	three	times." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	did	it	look	like?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	looked	like	a	man's	figure	swathed	in	some	white	drapery.	I	could	not	see	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">face,	but	it	was	certainly	not	a	'dummy.'	But	come,	let	us	see	what	the	forces	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	 for	 us	 here	 to-night.	 I	 think	 we	 will	 need	 'Annie	 Laurie'	 to	 clear	 the	 air	 of debate." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Miller	began	the	song,	and	we	all	joined	in	softly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Our	newspaper	is	a	trusty	watch-dog,"	remarked	Miller,	significantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 he	 spoke	 the	 psychic	 began	 to	 toss	 and	 writhe	 and	 moan	 pitifully.	 Her</p>
<p class="calibre1">suffering	mounted	to	a	paroxysm	at	last;	then	silence	fell	for	a	minute	or	two—</p>
<p class="calibre1">absolute	stillness;	and	in	this	hush	the	table	took	life,	rose,	and	slid	away	toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">us	as	if	shoved	by	a	powerful	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	 far	 as	 my	 hearing	 goes,	 the	 psychic	 does	 not	 move,"	 I	 said.	 "Barring	 the light,	 this	 is	 a	 very	 good	 demonstration	 of	 movement	 without	 control.	 Every</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>movement	of	the	table	our	way	removes	it	farther	from	the	reach	of	the	psychic." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	hear	nothing	from	the	paper,"	confessed	Miller,	"and	yet	the	table	is	certainly moving." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	can	believe	this,	because	I	have	proved	these	movements	without	contact.	In</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	case	Mrs.	Smiley	cannot	reach	the	table	with	her	knees	and	her	feet	secured</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	tape	nailed	to	the	bookcase.	You	cannot	believe	she	has	gotten	out	of	her	skin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	newspaper	is	still	on	guard,	and	has	uttered	no	alarm." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	is	very	perplexing,"	Miller	admitted;	"but	anything	can	happen	in	the	dark." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 admit	 it	 is	 very	 easy	 to	 deceive	 our	 senses,	 but	 the	 silk	 thread	 is	 not	 to	 be fooled." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three	 times	 the	 table	 was	 urged	 in	 the	 same	 direction,	 each	 paroxysm	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">suffering,	of	moaning,	of	struggle,	on	the	part	of	the	psychic,	being	followed	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">few	 seconds	 later	 by	 absolute	 silence.	 It	 was	 in	 these	 moments	 of	 profound</p>
<p class="calibre1">sepulchral	hush	that	the	heavy	table	lurched	along	the	floor.	It	was	a	strange	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">startling	fact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why	are	you	doing	this?"	I	asked	of	the	forces.	"As	a	test?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">Yes</i>,"	the	raps	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	do	you	account	for	it,	Miller?"	I	asked,	with	challenge	in	my	voice.	"My conviction	is	that	we	are	confronting	a	case	of	telekinesis—not	as	convincing	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Flammarion's,	 but	 still	 inexplicable.	 If	 that	 table	 has	 moved	 an	 inch,	 it	 is	 the same	as	if	it	had	moved	a	foot.	You	should	feel	rewarded." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller	did	not	reply;	and	even	as	he	pondered	the	megaphone,	which	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">standing	on	the	top	of	the	table,	began	to	rock	on	its	base,	and	a	pencil	which	lay</p>
<p class="calibre1">beside	it	was	fumbled	as	if	by	a	rat	or	a	kitten.	In	our	state	of	strained	expectancy</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	sound	was	very	startling	indeed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	 about	 that,	 Miller?"	 I	 asked,	 in	 a	 tone	 of	 exultation.	 "Who's	 doing	 that? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Last	 time	 you	 suspected	 Howard,	 now	 here	 you	 must	 suspect	 the	 psychic.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">movement	 of	 that	 pencil	 is	 of	 enormous	 significance.	 How	 can	 she	 possibly</p>
<p class="calibre1">reach	and	handle	that	cone?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	can't,	unless	she	has	freed	her	hands,"	he	admitted.	"Let	us	touch	hands."	I gave	him	my	left	hand,	and	sitting	thus,	with	all	hands	accounted	for,	we	entered</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a>into	communication	with	the	"spirit"	that	was	busy	in	the	centre	of	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are	you	present,	'Wilbur'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Tap,	tap,	tap. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are	you	moving	the	table?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Tap,	tap,	tap. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">"To	get	it	out	of	reach	of	the	psychic?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Tap,	tap,	tap. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly,	with	a	loud	bang,	something	heavy	fell	upon	the	table.	Releasing	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands	 of	 my	 fellow-investigators,	 I	 felt	 about	 for	 this	 object	 and	 found	 that	 a book	had	been	brought	and	thrown	upon	the	table.	A	shower	of	others	followed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">till	twenty-four	were	piled	about	the	cone.	They	came	whizzing	with	power,	yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 such	 precision	 that	 no	 head	 was	 touched	 and	 the	 cone	 remained</p>
<p class="calibre1">undisturbed.	It	was	as	if	some	roguish	poltergeist	had	suddenly	developed	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Miller,	I	find	this	exciting!"	said	I,	after	silver	fell	upon	the	table.	"Suppose	we ask	'Wilbur'	to	fetch	some	small	object	whose	position	you	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Miller	then	said:	"There	is	a	box	of	candy	on	a	shelf	back	of	Mrs.	Smiley.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	quite	out	of	her	reach.	Can	you	bring	that	to	me,	'Wilbur'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Tap,	 tap,	 tap! </i>	 was	 the	 decided	 answer,	 and	 almost	 immediately	 the	 box	 was placed	on	the	top	of	the	table	and	shoved	along	toward	Mrs.	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	a	good	demonstration,"	I	remarked,	and	'Wilbur'	drummed	a	sharp	tattoo of	satisfaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	my	request	he	then	wrote	his	name	on	a	pad	while	Miller	waited	and	listened, </p>
<p class="calibre1">his	mind	too	busy	with	surmise	to	permit	of	speech.	(He	told	me	afterward	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 was	 perfectly	 sure	 the	 psychic	 had	 wrenched	 free	 of	 her	 tacks	 and	 he	 was wondering	how	she	would	contrive	to	put	herself	back	again.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally	I	asked:	"Are	you	still	with	us,	'Wilbur'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	force	tapped	smartly	on	the	tin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now,	 just	 to	 show	 you	 that	 the	 psychic	 is	 not	 doing	 this,	 can't	 you	 hold	 up	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p70"></a>book	between	me	and	the	light?	I	want	to	see	your	hand." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instantly,	and	to	my	profound	amazement,	a	book	rose	in	the	air,	and	I	could	see</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">two	hands</i>	in	silhouette	plainly	and	vigorously	thumbing	the	volume,	which	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">held	about	three	feet	above	the	table,	and	to	the	psychic's	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Miller,"	I	said,	excitedly,	"I	see	hands!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	do	not,"	he	answered;	"but	I	hear	a	rustling." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Swift	on	the	trail,	I	called	out:	"Now,	show	me	your	empty	hand,	'Wilbur.'	I	want</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	see	how	big	it	is."	A	moment	later	I	exclaimed,	in	profound	excitement:	"I	can see	a	 <i class="calibre4">large</i>	hand	against	the	window,	and,	strangest	part	of	all,	the	spread	fingers are	 pointing	  <i class="calibre4">toward</i>	 Mrs.	 Smiley,	 the	 wrist	 is	 nearest	 you	 and	 at	 least	 six	 feet from	the	psychic.	It	is	a	man's	hand.	You	are	not	doing	this,	Miller?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Certainly	not!"	he	answered,	curtly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This	is	astonishing!	It	certainly	is	a	hand	and	much	larger	than	that	of	a	woman, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 <i class="calibre4">the	wrist	is	toward	you</i>.	It	is	still	at	least	four	feet	from	the	psychic.	Oh,	for	a flash-light	camera	now!	I	was	perfectly	certain	that	this	is	not	the	psychic's	hand, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	yet	to	admit	that	it	is	not	is	to	grant	the	whole	theory	of	materialization." </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 last	 the	 shadow	 disappeared.	 The	 book	 fell.	 With	 a	 ringing	 scrape	 the	 cone rose	 in	 the	 air	 and	 the	 voice	 of	 "Wilbur"	 came	 from	 it	 life-like—almost	 full-toned,	and	with	a	note	of	humorous	exultation	running	through	it.	"  <i class="calibre4">I	told	you	I'd</i> <i class="calibre4">astonish	you! </i>"	he	said.	"  <i class="calibre4">Don't	get	in	a	hurry;	there's	more	coming. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	nearly	two	hours	thereafter	this	"spirit	voice"	kept	us	all	interested	and	busy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 was	 very	 much	 alive,	 and	 we	 alternately	 laughed	 at	 his	 quaint	 conceits	 or pondered	 the	 implications	 of	 his	 casual	 remarks.	 It	 was	 precisely	 as	 if	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">rollicking	 Western,	 or,	 rather,	 Southern,	 man	 were	 speaking	 to	 us	 over	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">'phone.	I	asked:	"Who	are	you?	Is	'Wilbur'	your	surname?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">No;	my	middle	name.	My	family	name	is	Thompson. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	characterization	was	perfect.	He	responded	to	every	question	with	readiness</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 perfect	 aplomb.	 At	 times	 he	 played	 jokes	 on	 us.	 He	 bumped	 Miller	 on	 the head,	and	touched	him	on	the	cheek	farthest	from	the	psychic.	At	my	request	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">covered	 Mrs.	 Miller's	 ear	 with	 the	 large	 end	 of	 the	 horn,	 then	 reversed	 and nuzzled	her	temple	with	the	small	end.	She	said	it	felt	like	a	caress,	as	if	guided</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	a	tender	hand.	She	had	become	clairvoyant	also,	and	saw	many	forms	about</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>the	room.	I	could	see	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tell	us	more	about	yourself,	'Wilbur'?"	I	asked.	"Who	are	you?	What	did	you	do on	the	earth?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">I	was	a	soldier. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In	the	Civil	War?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">Yes. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"On	which	side?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">That's	a	leading	question</i>,"	he	answered,	with	some	hesitation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	come	now,	the	war	is	over!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">I	was	on	the	Southern	side.	I	am	Jeff.	W.	Thompson.	I	was	a	brigadier-general. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where	were	you	killed?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">I	was	invalided	home	to	Jefferson	City,	and	passed	out	there. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	do	you	happen	to	be	'guide'	to	this	little	woman?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 hesitated	 again.	 "  <i class="calibre4">I	 was	 attracted	 to	 her</i>,"	 he	 said,	 and	 gave	 no	 further explanation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mitchell"	 then	 came	 and	 said:	 "  <i class="calibre4">We	 are	 deeply	 interested	 in	 your	 experiments,</i> <i class="calibre4">Mr.	Garland,	and	will	afford	you	all	the	aid	in	our	power.	It	is	hard	to	meet	your</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">tests—hard,	 I	 mean,	 for	 our	 medium,	 but	 we	 will	 assist	 her	 to	 fill	 the</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">requirements. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank	you.	I	don't	see	how	any	psychic	could	be	more	submissive." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	 Miller,	 deeply	 impressed	 by	 all	 this,	 began	 to	 inquire	 concerning	 those	 of the	invisible	host	 whose	 names	 were	 familiar	 to	 her.	 It	 was	 evident	 that	 she,	 at least,	was	convinced	of	their	reality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile,	the	movement	of	the	cone	interested	Miller	more	than	the	messages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	does	she	do	it?"	he	exclaimed	several	times.	"To	touch	Mrs.	Miller	means that	the	psychic	must	not	only	have	free	use	of	her	hands:	she	must	rise	from	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">chair	and	pass	behind	me	and	the	wall." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	precision	of	the	action	is	my	amazement,"	I	replied.	"I've	noticed	this	same</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a>thing	 many	 times.	 Apparently,	 darkness	 is	 no	 barrier	 to	 action	 on	 the	 part	 of these	forces.	That	cone,	you	will	observe,	can	touch	you	on	the	nose,	eyelid,	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">ear,	softly,	without	jar	or	jolt.	It	came	to	me	just	now	like	a	sentient	thing—like</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	human.	Such	unerring	flight	is	uncanny.	Could	any	trickster	perform</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	dark	with	such	precision	and	gentleness?	Of	course	this	is	not	conclusive</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	argument,	but	at	the	same	time	it	has	weight.	Whose	is	the	eye	that	directs	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">instrument?	Can	you	tell	us,	'Wilbur'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	chuckle	came	through	the	cone.	"  <i class="calibre4">I'm	doing	it. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	can	you	see?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">Day	and	night	are	all	the	same	to	me. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller	held	up	his	right	hand.	"Prove	it;	touch	my	knuckles!"	he	commanded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	moment's	silent	soaring	the	cone	struck	his	left	hand,	which	was	farthest</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	psychic,	and	a	voice	followed	it	with	laughter,	asking:	"  <i class="calibre4">What	made	you</i> <i class="calibre4">jump? </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	 Miller	 had	 recovered	 from	 the	 surprise	 of	 this,	 the	 table	 seemed	 to	 be grasped	and	shaken	as	if	by	a	man	of	giant	strength—and	yet	the	cone	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">books	did	not	shift	position.	Hands	patted	the	pillows	on	a	sofa	at	Miller's	right, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 one	 of	 these	 cushions	 was	 flung	 against	 his	 chair.	 The	 room	 seemed	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">swarm	 with	 tricksy	 Pucks.	 At	 last	 the	 cone	 took	 flight	 again,	 and	 moved	 about freely	among	the	heap	of	books	and	over	Miller's	head,	while	a	variety	of	voices</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	 successively	 from	 it,	 some	 of	 them	 speaking	 to	 Mrs.	 Miller	 and	 some	 to me.	 Several	 of	 the	 names	 given	 were	 known	 to	 Mrs.	 Miller,	 and	 a	 few	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognizable	by	me.	They	all	claimed	to	be	spirits	of	the	dead	with	messages	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">good	 cheer	 for	 friends	 on	 "the	 earth-plane,"	 but	 they	 were	 all	 rather	 vague	 and stereotyped.	 Once	 I	 thought	 I	 could	 see	 the	 cone	 passing	 between	 me	 and	 the window,	high	above	the	table.	It	seemed	to	float	horizontally	as	if	in	water.	Some</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	spirits	were	too	weak	to	raise	the	cone—so	"Wilbur"	said;	too	weak,	even, to	whisper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During	all	this	time	the	psychic	remained	in	trance—deathly	still;	but	"between</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	acts"	her	troubled	breathing	and	low	moans	could	be	heard.	So	far	as	hearing</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	define,	she	was	still	at	the	end	of	the	table,	where	she	had	been	placed	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 beginning	 of	 the	 sitting.	 None	 of	 these	 movements	 occasioned	 the	 slightest rustling	of	the	newspaper.	When	the	cone	was	moving	no	sound	was	heard.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">floor	 was	 of	 hard-wood,	 and,	 as	 one's	 hearing	 becomes	 very	 acute	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a>darkness,	I	am	certain	the	psychic	did	not	rise	from	her	chair.	She	was,	for	the most	part,	silent	as	a	dead	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	force	expended	on	the	table	was	very	great,	almost	furious,	and	even	if	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">psychic	 had	 been	 able	 to	 extend	 her	 foot	 or	 release	 a	 hand	 she	 could	 not	 have produced	 such	 movement,	 and	 if	 she	 had	 done	 so	 we	 could	 have	 detected	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Intelligent	forces	were	plainly	at	work	on	the	table,	and	writing	was	going	on.	So</p>
<p class="calibre1">far	 as	 I	 was	 concerned,	 I	 was	 convinced	 that	 the	 psychic	 had	 externalized	 her power	in	some	occult	fashion,	and	that	it	was	she	who	was	speaking	to	us.	It	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	if	she	were	able	to	 <i class="calibre4">will</i>	the	cone	to	rise	and	then	to	project	her	voice	into	it,	all of	which	seems	impossible	the	moment	it	is	stated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 length	 "Wilbur"	 said:	 "Good-night."	 I	 rose,	 and	 Miller,	 eagerly,	 expectantly, turned	the	light	slowly	on.  <i class="calibre4">Mrs.	Smiley	sat	precisely	as	we	had	last	seen	her.	Her</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">eyes	were	closed,	her	head	leaning	against	the	back	of	her	chair.	Her	hands	were</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">fastened	 exactly	 as	 we	 had	 left	 them,	 and,	 strangest	 thing	 of	 all,	 the	 table	 was</i> <i class="calibre4">pushed	away	from	her	so	that	the	silk	threads	were	tight. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	 you	 see	 that,	 Miller?"	 I	 exclaimed.	 "Will	 you	 tell	 me	 how	 that	 final movement	was	made?	'Wilbur'	has	given	us	an	unexpected	test.	Even	if	she	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">freed	her	hands,	she	could	not	have	tied	the	threads	and	returned	to	her	bonds; </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	if	she	first	returned	to	her	bonds,	how	could	she,	then,	have	pushed	the	table</p>
<p class="calibre1">away?	 The	 two	 things	 are	 mutually	 exclusive.	 Her	 feet	 are	 nailed	 to	 the	 floor, and	 the	 newspaper	 still	 on	 guard.	 Are	 we	 not	 forced	 to	 conclude	 that	 the	 table was	moved	by	some	supernormal	expenditure	of	force?	Her	hands	were	here,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">table	there.	Does	it	not	seem	to	you	a	case	of	the	'psychic	force,'	such	as	Crookes</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	Richet	describe?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller	 was	 confounded,	 but	 concealed	 it.	 "She	 may	 have	 shoved	 the	 table	 with her	feet." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How?	 Your	 newspaper	 is	 unbroken.	 Not	 a	 tack	 is	 disturbed.	 But	 suppose	 she did!	How	about	the	books?	Did	she	get	the	books	with	her	feet?	How	about	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">broad	 hand	 which	 I	 saw?	 How	 about	 the	 candy-box	 which	 was	 moved	 from	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">point	 seven	 feet	 away?	 How	 could	 she	 slip	 from	 her	 bonds?	 See	 these	 threads, actually	 sunk	 into	 her	 wrists!"	 I	 continued.	 "No,	 my	 conviction	 is	 that	 she	 has not	once	moved." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	cannot	admit	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	mean	you	dare	not!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a>Mrs.	Miller	was	indignant	at	our	delay.	"The	poor	thing!	It	is	a	shame!	Unfasten her	at	once!	You	are	torturing	her!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait	a	few	moments,"	said	Miller,	inexorably.	"I	want	to	make	a	few	notes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile	 I	 took	 the	 psychic's	 pulse.	 It	 was	 very	 slow,	 faint,	 and	 irregular.	 It was,	 indeed,	 only	 a	 faint,	 sluggish	 throb	 at	 long	 intervals,	 and	 each	 throb	 was followed	only	by	a	feeble	fluttering.	Her	skin	was	cold,	her	arms	perfectly	inert</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	numb,	and	she	came	very	slowly	back	to	consciousness.	I	had	a	conviction</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	the	moment	that	she	had	been	out	of	her	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	I	rubbed	her	hands	and	arms,	Miller	took	notes	and	measurements.	There</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	more	than	two	dozen	books	on	the	table,	and	some	of	them	had	come	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">shelves	 three	 feet	 distant	 and	 a	 little	 above	 the	 psychic's	 shoulders.	 It	 was	 true she	could	have	reached	them	with	a	free	arm,	but	she	had	no	free	arm!	The	pad</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 middle	 of	 the	 table	 was	 scrawled	 upon.	 "Wilbur"	 was	 written	 there,	 and short	 messages	 from	 "Mr.	 Mitchell"	 and	 other	 "ghosts."	 Therefore,	 it	 is	 of	 no value	to	say	we	were	collectively	hypnotized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	she	came	to	life,	Mrs.	Smiley	complained	of	being	numb.	"My	arms	are	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">logs,"	she	said,	"and	so	are	my	feet.	My	'guides'	say	that	if	you	will	put	one	palm to	my	forehead	and	the	tips	of	your	fingers	at	the	base	of	my	brain	it	will	help</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	to	liven	up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	did	as	she	requested,	and	was	at	once	conscious	of	great	heat	and	turmoil	in	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">head.	 It	 appeared	 to	 throb	 as	 if	 in	 receding	 excitement.	 I	 thought	 of	 Richet's observations	 (that	 in	 cases	 of	 materialization	 the	 psychic	 seemed	 shrunk	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">weakened),	 and	 narrowly	 scanned	 the	 helpless	 woman.	 She	 seemed	 at	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment	small	and	bloodless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Were	you	conscious	of	groaning	and	gasping?"	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	I	have	no	recollection	of	anything.	I	am	told	I	do	make	a	great	fuss,	but	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">don't	know	it.	Did	anything	happen?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	very	great	deal	happened,"	I	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled	in	quiet	satisfaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	glad.	Mr.	Miller	has	been	good	and	patient;	it	would	have	been	a	shame	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappoint	him.	If	you	will	only	keep	from	being	too	anxious	you'll	get	anything</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	want." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a>"That's	what	'Mitchell'	said." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Miller	patted	her	hands.	"You	must	be	very	tired,	poor	thing?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	do	feel	weak,	but	that	will	soon	pass	away.	What	time	is	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller	looked	at	his	watch.	"Great	Scott!	It's	after	one	o'clock." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Absorbing	business,	isn't	it?"	said	I. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Miller	invited	Mrs.	Smiley	to	stay	the	remainder	of	the	night	and	took	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">away	to	bed,	leaving	us	to	measure	and	weigh	and	surmise.	It	seemed	absurd—</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	a	dream;	and	yet	there	lay	the	visible,	tangible	proofs	of	the	marvel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Everything	 took	 place	 within	 her	 reach,	 provided	 she	 could	 have	 freed	 her hands,"	Miller	repeated,	as	he	sat	in	her	chair	and	studied	the	books	on	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Miller,"	 said	 I,	 with	 conviction,	 "  <i class="calibre4">that	 woman	 did	 not	 lift	 her	 wrists	 from	 that</i> <i class="calibre4">chair</i>! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	see	how	she	did	it;	but	to	say	she	did	not,	is	to	admit	the	preposterous.	I wish	she	had	permitted	us	to	hold	her	hands." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	know	of	another	psychic	in	America	who	would	have	submitted	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">test	we	put	upon	Mrs.	Smiley	to-night,	but	'Mitchell'	has	assured	me	he	will	go</p>
<p class="calibre1">further:	he	will	let	us	hold	her	hands	and	turn	on	the	light.	I	feel	as	if	the	great</p>
<p class="calibre1">mystery	 were	 almost	 within	 our	 grasp.	 By	 the	 ghost	 of	 Euclid!	 I	 have	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">conviction	 at	 this	 moment	 that	 we	 are	 at	 the	 point	 of	 proving	 for	 ourselves	 the elongation	 of	 the	 psychic's	 limbs!	 Suppose	 Flammarion	 is	 right?	 Suppose	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	psychic	can	extend	her	arms	beyond	their	normal	proportions?	You	should	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">ready	 to	 give	 a	 year,	 ten	 years,	 to	 demonstrating	 a	 single	 one	 of	 these	 physical effects.	 If	 I	 am	 any	 judge	 of	 character,	 this	 little	 woman	 is	 as	 honest	 and	 as wholesome	 as	 Mrs.	 Miller	 herself.	 It	 isn't	 this	 one	 performance	 alone	 which</p>
<p class="calibre1">proves	it.	It	is	the	implication	of	a	dozen	other	sittings,	almost	as	convincing	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">this,	 that	 gives	 me	 hope	 of	 proving	 something.	 Let	 us	 have	 our	 next	 sitting	 at Cameron's.	 It	 is	 only	 fair	 to	 readmit	 them,	 for	 we	 have	 proven	 that	 they	 had nothing	to	do	with	our	performance	that	first	night.	Let	us	ask	to	be	permitted	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">hold	 the	 hands	 and	 feet	 of	 the	 psychic,	 and	 also	 to	 take	 a	 flash-light	 picture	 of the	floating	cone.	We	may	yet	see	these	ghostly	hands	in	the	light	of	the	lamp." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller	 was	 shaken.	 I	 could	 see	 that.	 He	 sat	 like	 one	 who	 has	 been	 dealt	 a stunning	blow. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>"I	don't	believe	it—I	can't	believe	it,"	he	repeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Crookes	got	some	photos	of	'Katie	King,'	and	I	fully	believe	that	Mrs.	Smiley</p>
<p class="calibre1">may	be	developed	further.	Anyhow,	let's	test	her.	Now	for	a	word	of	theory.	This</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	the	way	it	all	appears	to	me	at	this	time.	She	seems	to	enter	successively	three</p>
<p class="calibre1">stages	 of	 hypnotic	 sleep.	 In	 the	 first	 stage	 the	 'spirits'	 speak	 through	 her	 own throat—or	 she	 impersonates,	 as	 Mrs.	 Harris	 did.	 Her	 second	 and	 deeper	 sleep</p>
<p class="calibre1">permits	 of	 the	 movement	 of	 the	 cone—'telekinesis,'	 'independent	 slate-writing,' </p>
<p class="calibre1">etc.	 But	 in	 this	 final	 deathly	 trance	 she	 has	 the	 power	 of	 projecting	 her	 astral hands,	whatever	that	may	mean,	and	the	production	of	spirit	voices.	Perhaps	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">has	an	astral	head—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	believe	a	word	of	it!	It	is	all	impossible,	monstrous!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	how	will	you	explain	this	performance?	What	about	the	tacks,	the	threads, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 tapes	 that	 bound	 her?	 She	 brought	 books,	 shook	 the	 table,	 touched	 us—</p>
<p class="calibre1">How?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 don't	 know;	 but	 there	 must	 be	 some	 perfectly	 natural	 way	 of	 explaining	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 is	 no	 place	 for	 the	 supernatural	 in	 my	 world.	 She	 seems	 a	 nice,	 simple little	woman,	and	yet	this	very	simplicity	may	be	a	means	of	throwing	us	off	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">guard.	I	will	give	a	hundred	dollars	for	permission	to	hold	her	hands	while	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cone	is	moving." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	you	do	not	believe	in	tacks,	will	you	believe	in	the	touch	of	your	fingers?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	she	permits	me	to	hold	her	and	the	cone	moves	I	will	surrender." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	you	won't.	You	think	you	will,	but	you	won't.	Don't	deceive	yourself.	I've</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	all	through	it.	You	 <i class="calibre4">can't</i>	believe	until	some	fundamental	change	takes	place in	your	mind.	You	must	struggle	just	as	Richet	did." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Anyhow,	 let's	 turn	 the	 screws	 tighter.	 Let's	 devise	 some	 other	 plan	 to	 make ourselves	doubly	certain	of	her	part	in	the	performance." </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 this	 understanding	 I	 said	 good-night,	 and	 took	 my	 lonely	 way	 to	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">apartment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	deliciously	fresh	and	weirdly	still	in	the	street,	and	as	I	looked	up	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">glowing	stars	and	down	the	long,	empty	street	my	mind	revolted.	"Can	it	be	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 good	 old	 theory	 of	 the	 permanence	 of	 matter	 is	 a	 gross	 and	 childish	 thing? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Do	the	dead	tell	tales,	after	all?	I	wish	I	could	believe	it.	Perhaps	old	Tontonava</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a>was	 right.	 Perhaps	 if	 we	 were	 all	 to	 pray	 for	 the	 happy	 hunting-grounds	 at	 the same	moment	and	in	perfect	faith,	the	lost	paradise	would	return	builded	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">simple	power	of	our	thought." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 Richet's	 moving	 confession	 came	 to	 me:	 "It	 took	 me	 twenty	 years	 of patient	 research	 to	 arrive	 at	 my	 present	 conviction.	 Nay	 (to	 make	 one	 last</p>
<p class="calibre1">confession),	I	am	not	yet	absolutely	and	irremediably	convinced.	In	spite	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">astounding	 phenomena	 which	 I	 have	 witnessed,	 I	 have	 still	 a	 trace	 of	 doubt—</p>
<p class="calibre1">doubt	which	is	weak,	indeed,	to-day,	but	which	may,	perchance,	be	stronger	to-</p>
<p class="calibre1">morrow.	Yet	such	doubts,	if	they	come,	will	not	be	due	so	much	to	any	defect	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	actual	experiment	as	to	the	inexorable	strength	of	prepossession	which	holds</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	back	from	adopting	a	conclusion	which	contravenes	the	habitual	and	almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">unanimous	opinion	of	mankind." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a><b class="calibre3">V</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 this	 point	 the	 sittings,	 which	 had	 begun	 so	 interestingly,	 suddenly	 began	 to fail	of	results.	The	power	unaccountably	weakened.	Miller	and	several	others	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 circle	 believed	 these	 failures	 to	 be	 due	 to	 the	 increased	 rigidity	 of	 the restraint	 we	 had	 imposed	 upon	 the	 medium.	 The	 next	 "session"	 was	 held	 in Fowler's	 down-town	 office,	 against	 the	 hesitating	 protest	 of	 the	 psychic,	 who</p>
<p class="calibre1">said:	 "The	 atmosphere	 of	 the	 place	 is	 not	 good."	 By	 which	 she	 meant	 that	 the associations	 of	 the	 office,	 with	 the	 hurry	 and	 worry	 of	 business,	 were	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">opposition	to	the	mood	necessary	for	the	production	of	the	phenomena. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 real	 reason,"	 declared	 Howard,	 "is	 this:	 we're	 now	 getting	 down	 to	 brass tacks	in	her	business." </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	literally	true.	At	Miller's	suggestion	a	strong	tape,	perhaps	half	an	inch</p>
<p class="calibre1">wide,	had	been	passed	about	the	psychic's	wrist	and	tied	in	a	close,	square	knot, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	finally	a	long	brass	tack	was	driven	down	through	both	strands	of	the	tape</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	the	chair-arm.	This	was	in	reality	as	secure	as	a	handcuff.	Nothing	happened</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	night	beyond	the	movement	of	the	table	and	some	rather	weak	raps,	and	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	rose	from	our	seats	worn	and	disappointed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	we	met	the	next	night	in	the	same	place,	and	adjusted	the	ever-tightening</p>
<p class="calibre1">bands	 upon	 the	 psychic,	 she	 sat	 helplessly	 for	 three	 hours.	 I	 began	 to	 lose confidence	 in	 her	 power	 to	 do	 anything	 beyond	 the	 ordinary.	 Howard,	 Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quigg,	and	Miss	Brush	dropped	out	before	the	sitting	was	over.	Only	Brierly	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself	 met	 the	 psychic	 at	 the	 Camerons'	 on	 the	 following	 Thursday.	 Again	 we</p>
<p class="calibre1">sat	 patiently	 for	 long	 hours,	 with	 only	 the	 movement	 of	 the	 table	 and	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">drumming	 upon	 the	 top	 in	 response	 to	 our	 requests.	 Miller	 now	 said:	 "I	 would like	to	have	one	more	sitting	in	my	library,	to	see	if	we	can	duplicate	the	marvels</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	our	previous	séance." </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 did	 not.	 The	 table	 alone	 moved,	 but	 it	 did	 this	 under	 absolutely	 test</p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions.	 Over	 each	 of	 the	 psychic's	 arms	 a	 lady's	 stocking	 was	 drawn,	 and pinned	to	her	dress	at	the	shoulder.	On	each	hand	a	luminous	pasteboard	star	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">fastened,	 and	 her	 wrists	 were	 tied	 and	 tacked,	 as	 before.	 Again	 we	 nailed	 her dress	to	the	floor	and	covered	her	knees	with	a	newspaper,	and	Miller	and	I	held</p>
<p class="calibre1">threads	 which	 were	 knotted	 to	 her	 wrists.	 Nevertheless,	 under	 these	 conditions</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a>the	 table	 moved	 while	 no	 one	 touched	 it,	 but	 always	 in	 a	 line	 away	 from	 the psychic.	 At	 the	 moment	 of	 the	 sliding	 of	 the	 table	 I	 closely	 watched	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">luminous	stars,	and	asserted	to	the	others	that	her	hands	did	not	stir.	So	that	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">movement,	though	slight,	was	genuinely	telekinetic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 very	 curious	 incident	 now	 cut	 short	 our	 sitting.	 Miller,	 who	 thought	 the	 left hand	 of	 the	 psychic	 was	 not	 in	 place,	 twitched	 the	 string	 which	 he	 held,	 and immediately	Mrs.	Smiley	began	to	twist	and	sigh,	and	"Maud"	complained	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 mamma	 had	 been	 injured	 by	 the	 jerking	 of	 the	 thread	 by	 Professor	 Miller, and	said	that	the	sitting	would	have	to	stop.	We	lighted	up	and	found	the	psychic</p>
<p class="calibre1">apparently	suffering	keenly	from	a	severe	cramp	all	through	her	left	side,	and	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">good	 deal	 of	 rubbing	 was	 necessary	 to	 restore	 her	 to	 anything	 like	 a	 normal condition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	really	seemed	like	failure	for	my	psychic,	and	I	began	to	wonder	whether	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">books	 really	 did	 fly	 from	 Miller's	 shelves.	 I	 could	 not	 suspect	 the	 gentle	 little lady	 of	  <i class="calibre4">conscious</i>	 deceit,	 but	 with	 a	 knowledge	 of	 the	 wonderful	 deceptions	 of somnambulists	 and	 hysterics,	 I	 began	 to	 doubt.	 I	 urged	 Miller	 to	 try	 one	 more sitting.	 He	 consented,	 and	 we	 met	 at	 Brierly's	 house.	 Nothing	 happened	 during the	first	two	hours,	and	at	ten	o'clock,	or	thereabouts,	Miller,	Brierly,	and	Fowler</p>
<p class="calibre1">withdrew,	leaving	me	to	untie	and	restore	Mrs.	Smiley,	who	was	still	apparently</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	deep	sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	evident	that	the	guides	had	not	released	the	psychic,	and	"Maudie"	soon spoke,	 asking	 me	 to	 put	 her	 mamma	 into	 a	 wooden	 chair,	 and	 to	 take	 the	 cone apart	and	put	the	smaller	end	upon	the	table.	I	did	as	she	requested,	and	drew	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">psychic's	 chair	 and	 table	 together.	 "Wilbur"	 insisted	 that	 I	 tie	 the	 psychic	 as before,	but	I	replied,	rather	dejectedly:	"Oh	no;	let	things	go	on	as	they	are." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	insisted,	and,	with	very	little	faith	in	the	power	of	the	psychic,	I	did	as	I	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">told.	I	tied	her	wrists	separately	and	then	together,	and,	drawing	both	ends	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tape	into	my	left	hand,	I	passed	them	under	the	tip	of	my	forefinger	in	such	wise</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	I	could	feel	any	slightest	movement	of	the	psychic's	hands.	The	guides	asked</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	to	fasten	her	wrists	to	the	chair,	but	I	replied:	"I	am	satisfied." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again	I	was	brought	face	to	face	with	the	mystery	of	mediumship.	Sitting	thus, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 no	 one	 present	 but	 Mrs.	 Brierly,	 a	 woman	 to	 be	 trusted,	 the	 cone	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">drummed	upon	and	carried	about	as	if	by	a	human	hand.	It	touched	my	cheek	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	distance	of	two	feet	from	Mrs.	Smiley's	hands,	and	"Wilbur's"	voice—strong, </p>
<p class="calibre1">vital,	 humorous—came	 to	 me,	 conversing	 as	 readily,	 as	 sensibly,	 as	 any	 living</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>flesh-and-blood	person,  <i class="calibre4">and	all	the	time	I	held	to	my	tapes,	carefully	noting	that</i> <i class="calibre4">no	 movement,	 beyond	 a	 slight	 tremor</i>,	 took	 place	 in	 the	 psychic's	 arms.	 Just <i class="calibre4">before</i>	 each	 movement	 of	 the	 cone	 she	 shivered	 convulsively	 and	 sighed,	 but while	the	cone	moved	she	was	deathly	still.	Each	time	as	the	cone	left	the	table	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	to	rock	to	and	fro	as	though	a	hand	were	trying	to	grasp	it,	and	a	moment</p>
<p class="calibre1">later	 it	 rose	 with	 a	 light	 spring.	 My	 impression	 was—my	  <i class="calibre4">belief</i>	 at	 the	 moment was—that	 Mrs.	 Smiley	 had	 nothing	 to	 do	 in	 any	 ordinary	 way	 with	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">movement	of	the	horn.	If	there	is	any	virtue	in	a	taut	tape	and	my	sense	of	touch, </p>
<p class="calibre1">her	arms	lay	like	marble	during	the	precise	time	the	voice	was	speaking	to	me.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	detect	no	connection	between	herself	and	the	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mitchell"	assured	me	that	he	approved	of	every	test	we	were	putting	upon	"the instrument,"	and	expressed	confidence	that	she	would	triumph	over	Miller.	"But the	circles	have	been	too	often	changed,"	he	asserted,	"and	the	places	have	not been	 well	 chosen.	 All	 must	 be	 unhurried	 and	 harmonious,"	 he	 added,	 and	 I replied	 that	 I	 had	 been	 discouraged,	 but	 that	 this	 sitting	 had	 given	 me	 new interest.	"I	will	be	faithful	to	the	end,"	I	assured	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wilbur"	 and	 "Mitchell"	 were	 perfectly	 distinct	 personalities,	 and	 appeared	 to confer	and	act	together.	I	had	a	sense	of	nearness	to	the	solution	of	the	mystery</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	thrilled	me.	Here	in	the	circle	of	my	out-stretched	arms	the	incredible	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">happening.	I	held	Mrs.	Brierly's	hands,	and	controlled	(by	means	of	my	tightly</p>
<p class="calibre1">stretched	tape)	the	movements	of	the	psychic,	and	yet	the	megaphone	was	lifted, </p>
<p class="calibre1">handled,	used	as	a	mouthpiece	by	"spirits."	I	felt	that	if	at	the	moment	I	had	been able	 to	 turn	 on	 a	 clear	 light	 I	 could	 have	 seen	  <i class="calibre4">my</i>	 ghostly	 visitors.	 This	 final hour's	 experience	 revived	 all	 my	 confidence	 in	 Mrs.	 Smiley,	 and	 not	 even</p>
<p class="calibre1">another	long	series	of	absolute	failures	could	destroy	my	faith	in	her	honesty	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	belief	in	her	occult	powers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	patience	was	sorely	tried	by	twelve	almost	perfectly	useless	sittings,	during</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	 everybody	 dropped	 away	 but	 Mr.	 and	 Mrs.	 Fowler,	 Dr.	 Towne,	 Brierly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 myself.	 They	 were	 not	 utterly	 barren	 sittings,	 but	 the	 phenomena	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">repetitious	or	slight	and	fugitive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	and	Mrs.	Fowler	were	friends	of	Brierly,	and,	like	him,	avowed	spiritists,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	both	lent	their	best	efforts	to	make	the	tests	complete	and	convincing.	After</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying	 sittings	 here	 and	 there,	 we	 finally	 settled	 upon	 a	 series	 of	 afternoon sessions	 in	 Fowler's	 own	 house.	 This	 was	 the	 twenty-sixth	 sitting	 of	 the	 series, and	Cameron's	Amateur	Psychical	Society	was	practically	a	memory.	I	was	now</p>
<p class="calibre1">going	 ahead	 pretty	 much	 on	 my	 own	 lines,	 but	 with	 an	 eye	 to	 catching	 Miller</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>and	the	Camerons	at	a	successful	séance	before	concluding	my	search. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Smiley	was	in	great	distress	of	mind	over	the	failure	of	her	powers.	"I	guess</p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm	no	good	any	more,"	she	said.	"I	never	sit	now	without	a	feeling	that	perhaps my	power	is	gone	forever.	This	Eastern	climate	is	so	harsh	for	me,	and	I	long	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 own	 California.	 If	 you	 will	 not	 give	 up,	 I	 will	 keep	 trying	 as	 long	 as	 my guides	advise	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	have	done	your	part,"	I	said,	with	intent	to	console	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Please	don't	give	up,"	she	pleaded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 am	 not	 giving	 up—on	 the	 contrary,	 I	 am	 only	 beginning	 to	 fight,"	 I	 assured her,	paraphrasing	General	Grant,	or	some	other	obstinate	person.	"I	recognize	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">truth	 of	 what	 you	 complain	 about,	 but	 I	 am	 sure	 that	 at	 Fowler's,	 in	 a	 small, warm,	well-aired	room,	you	will	feel	at	home	and	be	secure	of	interruption." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Fowler,	a	very	sensitive,	thoughtful,	dark-eyed	little	lady,	received	us	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">appointed	hour	with	quiet	cordiality,	and	suggested	that	her	own	room	up-stairs</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	be	a	comfortable	and	retired	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	 this	 I	 agreed,	 and	 we	 set	 to	 work	 to	 prepare	 it	 for	 the	 sitting.	 Fowler	 and	 I assumed	 control	 of	 the	 psychic,	 though	 Brierly	 insisted	 that,	 as	 the	 house</p>
<p class="calibre1">belonged	to	Fowler,	it	would	be	more	convincing	if	he	were	not	connected	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 preparation	 of	 the	 room.	 "I	 don't	 think	 we	 need	 to	 consider	 hair-drawn objections,"	I	retorted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	before,	we	placed	Mrs.	Smiley	in	an	arm-chair	at	one	end	of	a	small	table;	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">before,	we	secured	her	ankles	by	looping	a	long	tape	about	them	and	nailing	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">two	 ends	 to	 the	 floor	 behind	 her.	 Mrs.	 Fowler	 introduced	 an	 innovation	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">sewing	the	tape	to	the	sleeves	of	our	psychic</i>.	This	made	slipping	out	of	the	tape an	impossibility,	but,	to	push	security	still	further,	I	drove	a	long	brass	tack	down</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">through	both	tape	and	doubled	sleeve</i>.	Not	content	even	with	this,	Fowler	put	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">second	tape	about	each	wrist,	to	add	further	security	and	to	take	off	the	strain	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">case	 of	 any	 unconscious	 movement.	 Another	 tape	 was	 carried	 across	 Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Smiley's	 dress	 about	 four	 inches	 below	 her	 knees,	 and	 pinned	 there.	 Next	 the ends	were	drawn	tight	and	tied	to	the	back	rung	of	her	chair.	By	this	we	intended</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	prevent	any	pushing	action	of	the	knees.	As	a	final	precaution,	we	nailed	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">dress	to	the	floor	in	front	with	three	tacks.	The	small	end	of	the	tin	cone	was	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">placed	 on	 the	 table	 (at	 the	 request	 of	 the	 psychic)	 and	 the	 large	 end	 deposited upright	on	the	carpet	near	Fowler.	Some	sheets	of	paper	and	a	pencil	were	laid</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a>upon	the	table.	Everything	movable	was	entirely	out	of	the	psychic's	reach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	about	three	o'clock	of	the	afternoon	when,	after	darkening	the	windows, </p>
<p class="calibre1">we	 took	 our	 seats	 in	 a	 little	 circle	 about	 the	 table.	 As	 usual,	 I	 guarded	 the psychic's	right	hand,	while	Fowler	sat	at	her	left.	Brierly	and	Mrs.	Fowler	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">opposite	Mrs.	Smiley.	The	room	was	lighter	than	at	any	other	of	our	sittings—</p>
<p class="calibre1">both	on	account	of	the	infiltering	light	of	day,	and	also	because	an	open	grate	fire</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	north	wall	sent	forth	an	occasional	flicker	of	red	flame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	sat	for	some	time	discussing	Miller	and	Harris	and	their	attitude	toward	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">psychic.	I	remarked:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"To	 me	 our	 failures,	 some	 of	 them	 at	 least,	 have	 been	 very	 instructive,	 but	 the gradual	falling	away	of	our	members	makes	evident	to	me	how	unlikely	it	is	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	official	commission	will	ever	settle	the	claims	of	spiritualism.	As	Maxwell</p>
<p class="calibre1">has	said:	'It	is	a	slow	process,	and	he	who	cannot	bring	himself	to	plod	patiently</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	to	wait	uncomplainingly	for	hours	at	a	time	will	not	go	far.'	I	confess	that	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">half-heartedness	of	our	members	has	disappointed	me.	I	told	them	at	the	outset</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 to	 expect	 entertainment,	 but	 they	 did.	 It	  <i class="calibre4">is</i>	 tiresome	 to	 sit	 night	 after	 night and	 get	 nothing	 for	 one's	 pains.	 It	 seems	 foolish	 and	 vain,	 but	 any	 real</p>
<p class="calibre1">investigator	accepts	all	these	discomforts	as	part	of	the	game.	Failures	are	sure	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">come	when	the	psychic	is	honest.	Only	the	juggler	can	produce	the	same	effects. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 medium	 is	 not	 a	 Leyden-jar	 nor	 an	 Edison	 battery;	 materialization	 is	 not</p>
<p class="calibre1">precisely	a	vaudeville	'stunt.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	call	the	last	sitting	a	failure,"	said	Fowler.	"The	conditions	were	strictly test	conditions,	and	yet	matter	was	moved	without	contact.	Of	course,	the	mere</p>
<p class="calibre1">movement	 of	 a	 table,	 or	 even	 of	 the	 trumpet,	 seems	 rather	 tame,	 as	 compared with	the	doings	of	'Katie	King';	but,	after	all,	a	single	genuine	case	of	telekinesis</p>
<p class="calibre1">should	be	of	the	greatest	value	to	the	physicist;	and,	as	for	the	psychologist,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fact	of	your	friend,	Mrs.	Thomas,	becoming	entranced	by	'Wilbur'	was	startling</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough,	in	all	conscience." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	think	Miller	believed	in	her	trance,"	said	I. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	 happened?"	 asked	 Brierly,	 who	 had	 not	 been	 present	 at	 this	 particular sitting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 answered:	 "Mrs.	 Thomas,	 a	 friend	 of	 mine,	 a	 very	 efficient,	 clear-brained person,	whom,	by-the-way,	we	had	asked	to	come	in	order	to	fully	preserve	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">proprieties,	suddenly	felt	a	twitching	in	her	left	hand,	which	was	touching	mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a>This	convulsive	movement	spread	to	her	shoulder,	until	her	whole	arm	began	to thresh	about	like	a	flail	in	a	most	alarming	way.	The	action	became	so	violent	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">last	that	she	called	upon	me	for	aid.	I	found	it	exceedingly	difficult	to	subdue	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">agitation	and	silence	her	rebellious	limb,	but	I	did	finally	succeed.	Nor	was	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">all.	 A	 few	 moments	 later,	 while	 helping	 us	 in	 the	 singing,	 my	 friend	 suddenly stopped	singing	and	began	to	laugh	in	a	deep,	guttural	fashion,	and	presently	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice—the	voice	of	a	man,	apparently—came	from	her	throat:	'  <i class="calibre4">Haw!	 haw!	 I've</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">got	ye	now!	I've	got	ye	now! </i>'	It	sounded	like	'Wilbur.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 seemed	 to	 amuse	 Mrs.	 Smiley.	 "It	 was	 'Wilbur,'"	 she	 said.	 "He	 loves	 to jump	 in	 and	 seize	 upon	 some	 one's	 vocal	 chords	 that	 way.	 It's	 a	 favorite	 joke with	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	horrible	taste!"	Mrs.	Fowler	shudderingly	exclaimed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	I	don't	know,"	remarked	Brierly.	"It	is	actually	no	worse	than	having	your hand	controlled." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"To	have	a	spirit	inside	of	one's	throat	is	a	little	startling,	even	to	me,"	I	admitted, sympathetically.	 "But	 there	 was	 more	 of	 this	 business.	 Another	 member	 of	 the circle—a	 young	 man—became	 entranced,	 and	 proceeded	 to	 impersonate	 lost</p>
<p class="calibre1">souls,	'earth-bound	spirits,'	in	the	manner	of	our	friend	Mrs.	Harris,	and	wailed</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 wept	 and	 moaned	 in	 most	 grewsome	 fashion.	 However,	 I	 think	 Miller</p>
<p class="calibre1">considered	both	of	these	performances	merely	cases	of	hysteria,	induced	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">darkness	 and	 the	 constraint	 of	 sitting	 about	 the	 table.	 And	 perhaps	 he	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">correct." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Anything	 a	 doctor	 doesn't	 understand	 he	 calls	 hysteria,"	 put	 in	 Brierly.	 "I consider	these	specialists	nuisances." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	anyhow,	our	'Amateur	Spook-spotter	Association'	seems	to	have	come	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	 untimely	 end,"	 said	 I,	 regretfully.	 "Of	 the	 original	 number,	 only	 Brierly remains.	Wouldn't	our	deserters	be	chagrined	if	we	should	now	proceed	to	enjoy</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	really	startling	session?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	will,"	Mrs.	Smiley	responded.	"I	feel	the	power	all	about	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good!"	cried	Fowler.	"That	is	the	way	you	should	feel.	If	you	are	at	ease,	the spirits	will	do	the	rest." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sit	 back	 and	 rest,"	 I	 said.	 "We	 have	 plenty	 of	 time.	 You've	 been	 too	 anxious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Don't	worry." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a>In	 the	 mean	 while,	 between	 the	 sitting	 at	 Miller's	 house	 and	 this	 present	 one,	 I had	been	reading	much	on	the	subject	of	the	trance	and	of	"the	externalization	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	fluidic	double,"	of	which	the	Continental	philosophers	have	much	to	say.	If</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	convinced,	I	was	at	least	under	conviction	that	the	liberation	of	the	astral	self</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 possible	 (if	 at	 all)	 only	 in	 the	 deepest	 trance,	 and	 I	 now	 attempted	 to discover	by	interrogation	of	Mrs.	Smiley	precisely	what	her	own	conception	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	process	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	told	me	once	that	you	are	conscious	of	leaving	your	body	when	in	trance," </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said.	"Do	you	always	have	that	sensation?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	 I	 almost	 always	 have	 a	 feeling	 of	 floating	 in	 the	 air,"	 she	 answered.	 "It often	 seems	 as	 if	 I	 had	 risen	 a	 few	 feet	 above	 and	 a	 little	 to	 one	 side	 of	 my material	self,	to	which	I	am	somehow	attached.	I	can	see	my	body	and	what	goes</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	around	it,	and	yet,	somehow,	it	all	seems	kind	of	dim,	like	a	dream.	It's	hard</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	tell	you	just	what	I	mean,	but	I	seem	to	be	in	both	places	at	once." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	you	ever	have	any	perception	of	a	physical	connection	between	yourself	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	sitters?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 seemed	 to	 me	 to	 answer	 this	 a	 bit	 reluctantly.	 "Yes,	 I	 sometimes	 feel	 as though	 little	 shining	 threads	 went	 out	 from	 me	 and	 those	 in	 the	 circle,	 and sometimes	 these	 threads	 meet	 and	 twine	 themselves	 around	 the	 cone	 or	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pencil.	This	means	that	I	draw	power	from	all	my	sitters." </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 was	 in	 accord	 with	 the	 accounts	 of	 a	 "cobwebby	 feeling"	 which	 both Maxwell	and	Flammarion	had	drawn	from	their	mediums.	Maxwell	makes	much</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 this	 curious	 physical	 sensation	 which	 accompanied	 certain	 of	 M.	 Meurice's</p>
<p class="calibre1">phenomena.	Here	also	seemed	to	be	an	unconscious	corroboration	of	Albert	de</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rochas's	 experiments	 in	 the	 "externalization	 of	 motivity,"	 as	 he	 calls	 it.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">"cobwebby	 feeling"	 of	 the	 fingers	 might	 mean	 an	 actual	 raying-out	 of	 some subtle	 form	 of	 matter.	 Indeed,	 M.	 Meurice,	 Maxwell's	 medium,	 declared	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 see	 "a	 sheath	 of	 filaments	 pass	 from	 his	 fingers	 to	 the	 objects	 of experimentation." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tell	 us	 about	 your	 journeys	 into	 the	 spirit	 land,"	 I	 suggested.	 "You	 sometimes seem	to	go	far	away,	do	you	not?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	voice	became	very	wistful	as	she	complied.	"Yes,	sometimes	I	seem	to	go	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 far-off,	 bright	 world.	 I	 don't	 always	 want	 to	 come	 back,	 but	 there	 is	 a	 little shining	white	ribbon	that	unites	my	spirit	with	my	body	and	holds	me	fast.	Once</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a>when	I	had	resolved	never	to	return,	that	little	band	of	light	began	to	tug	at	me, and,	although	it	broke	my	heart	to	leave	my	children,	who	were	there	with	me,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">yielded,	and	came	back	to	life.	It	was	very	cheerful	and	lovely	in	that	land,	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">hated	to	come	back	to	the	cold	and	cruel	earth-plane." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can't	you	tell	us	about	it	more	particularly?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No;	it	is	so	different	from	this	plane	that	I	have	no	words	in	which	to	describe</p>
<p class="calibre1">it.	All	I	can	say	is	that	it	seems	glorious	and	happy	and	very	light." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	 in	 her	 gentle	 accent	 excited	 Fowler's	 sympathy.	 "Mrs.	 Smiley,	 you have	the	blood	of	the	martyrs	in	you.	It	takes	courage	to	put	one's	self	into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands	 of	 a	 cold-blooded	 scientist	 like	 Miller.	 Even	 Garland,	 here,	 has	 no	 pity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He's	 like	 a	 hound	 on	 the	 trail	 of	 a	 fawn.	 It's	 all	 'material'	 for	 him.	 Now,	 I	 am nothing	but	a	mild-mannered	editor.	I	have	all	the	facts	I	require	concerning	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">spirit	 world.	 I	 am	 busied	 with	 trying	 to	 make	 people	 happy	 here	 on	 this	 earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 these	 scientific	 'sharps'	 are	 avid	 for	 any	 fact	 which	 sustains	 the	 particular theory	they	happen	to	hold.	Not	one	in	a	hundred	will	go	where	the	facts	lead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	investigation	is	all	a	process	of	self-glorification,	wherein	each	one	thinks</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	must	prove	all	the	others	liars	or	weak-minded	in	order	to	exalt	himself." </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	this	I	could	only	reply:	"I'm	not	a	scientist,	though,	I	must	say,	I	sympathize</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 the	 scientific	 method.	 And	 as	 for	 my	 treatment	 of	 Mrs.	 Smiley,	 I	 am</p>
<p class="calibre1">following	exactly	the	advice	of	her	controls.	They	assure	me	that	they	will	take</p>
<p class="calibre1">care	of	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	so	they	will,"	responded	the	devoted	little	psychic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	the	closest	questioning	I	had	never	been	able	to	change	a	single	line	of	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">simple	 faith.	 She	 was	 perfectly	 certain	 of	 the	 spirit	 world.	 She	 had	 daily</p>
<p class="calibre1">messages	 from	 "Wilbur"	 and	 her	 spirit	 father,	 partly	 by	 voices,	 but	 mainly	 by intuition.	Her	children	hovered	over	her	while	she	slept.	"Mitchell"	healed	her	if she	were	ill.	"Maudie"	comforted	her	loneliest	hours.	These	voices,	these	hands were	an	integral	part	of	her	world—as	necessary	and	as	dear	to	her	as	those	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 friends	 in	 the	 flesh.	 As	 she	 talked	 on	 I	 experienced	 a	 keen	 pang	 of	 regret. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why	 disturb	 her	 belief	 in	 the	 spirit	 world?"	 I	 asked	 myself.	 "Why	 attempt	 to reduce	 her	 manifestations	 to	 natural	 magic?	 To	 rob	 her	 of	 her	 conviction	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">'Maudie'	is	able	to	come	back	to	her	would	leave	her	poor	indeed." </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,	 as	 the	 scientist	 cannot	 permit	 pity	 to	 hinder	 his	 purpose,	 I	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">determined	to	disassociate	the	 <i class="calibre4">facts</i>	of	spiritualism	from	the	 <i class="calibre4">cult</i>	of	spiritualism. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a>I	was	not	concerned	with	faith	or	consolation.	I	returned	to	a	study	of	the	facts	as a	part	of	nature.	I	was	now	observing	closely	the	three	levels	of	sleep	into	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Smiley	seemed	to	lower	herself	at	will,	or	upon	the	suggestion	of	those	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 circle.	 I	 had	 adopted	 the	 theory	 that	 in	 the	 lighter	 trance	 she	 spoke</p>
<p class="calibre1">unconsciously	 and	 wrote	 automatically.	 In	 the	 second,	 and	 deeper,	 trance	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1">became	 the	 somnambulist	 possessed	 of	 diabolic	 cleverness,	 when,	 with	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">higher	senses	in	abeyance,	she	was	able	to	deceive	and	to	elude	all	detection.	In</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 third,	 or	 death-like,	 trance,	 I	 was	 ready	 to	 admit,	 for	 the	 sake	 of	 argument, that	 she	 was	 able,	 as	 De	 Rochas	 and	 Maxwell	 seem	 to	 have	 demonstrated,	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">exert	 an	 unknown	 form	 of	 force	 beyond	 the	 periphery	 of	 the	 body—that	 is	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">say,	to	move	objects	at	a	distance	and	to	produce	voices	from	the	horn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	 prove	 that	 she	 actually	 left	 the	 body	 would	 do	 much	 to	 explain	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">phenomena,	and	I	was	very	eager	to	push	toward	this	demonstration.	I	had	now</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 her	 chief	 inquisitor	 for	 nearly	 thirty	 sittings,	 and	 had	 developed</p>
<p class="calibre1">(apparently)	the	power	to	throw	her	into	trance	almost	instantly.	A	few	moments</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 monotonous	 humming,	 intoned	 while	 my	 hand	 rested	 upon	 hers,	 generally</p>
<p class="calibre1">sufficed	to	bring	the	first	stage	of	her	trance.	As	we	had	been	sitting	for	half	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">hour,	 I	 now	 proceeded	 to	 chant	 my	 potent	 charm,	 with	 intent	 to	 liberate	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">"spirits"	to	their	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 a	 few	 moments	 she	 responded	 to	 my	 suggestion.	 A	 nervous	 tremor,	 now</p>
<p class="calibre1">expected	 and	 now	 familiar,	 developed	 in	 her	 hands.	 This	 was	 followed	 by	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">slight,	 convulsive,	 straining	 movement	 of	 her	 arms.	 Her	 fingers	 grew	 hot,	 and seemed	 to	 quiver	 with	 electric	 energy.	 Ten	 minutes	 later	 all	 movement	 ceased. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	temperature	abruptly	fell.	Her	breath	grew	tranquil,	and	at	last	appeared	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">fail	 altogether.	 This	 was	 the	 first	 stage	 of	 her	 trance.	 "Take	 your	 hand	 away, Fowler,"	I	said.	"We	have	nothing	to	do	now	but	wait.	The	psychic	is	now	in	the hands	of	'Mitchell.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fowler	 remarked,	 with	 some	 humor:	 "I	 can	 tell	 by	 your	 tone	 that	 you're	 still unconvinced." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	 like	 the	 Scotchman—ready	 for	 convincement,	 but	 I'd	 like	 to	 see	 the	 man who	could	do	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 a	 few	 minutes'	 silence	 Mrs.	 Fowler	 asked:	 "What	 is	 the	 most	 conclusive phenomenon	you	have	ever	witnessed,	Mr.	Garland?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	a	little	difficult	to	answer,"	I	replied,	slowly,	"but	at	the	moment	I	think the	playing	of	a	closed	piano,	which	I	once	heard,	is	the	most	inexplicable	of	all</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>my	experiments." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	do	you	mean	by	'the	playing	of	a	closed	piano'?"	queried	Brierly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	tell	you	about	it.	It	happened	during	the	second	sitting	I	ever	had	with	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Smiley.	I	was	lecturing	in	her	home	town	at	the	time,	and	after	the	close	of	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">address,	and	while	we	were	talking	together,	some	one	who	was	aware	of	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Smiley's	 mediumship	 suggested:	 'Let's	 go	 somewhere	 and	 have	 a	 sitting.'	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">plan	pleased	me,	and,	after	some	banter	pro	and	con,	we	made	up	a	party	of	six</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	 eight	 people,	 and	 adjourned	 to	 the	 home	 of	 the	 chairman	 of	 the	 lecture</p>
<p class="calibre1">committee,	a	certain	Miss	Halsey.	I	want	to	emphasize	the	high	character	of	Miss</p>
<p class="calibre1">Halsey,	as	well	as	the	casual	way	in	which	we	happened	to	go	to	her	rooms,	for	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">puts	out	of	the	way	all	question	of	collusion.	There	was	no	premeditation	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">act,	 and	 Miss	 Halsey,	 who	 was	 the	 librarian	 of	 the	 city,	 and	 a	 pronounced</p>
<p class="calibre1">disbeliever	in	spiritistic	theories,	had	never	met	Mrs.	Smiley	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 circle	 was	 made	 up	 about	 equally	 of	 men	 and	 women,	 all	 of	 them	 well-known	 residents	 of	 the	 town.	 So	 far	 as	 most	 of	 the	 phenomena	 resulting	 from this	sitting	are	concerned,	they	have	very	little	value,	for	they	took	place	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dark	and	the	medium	was	not	closely	guarded.	It	was	only	toward	the	end	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sitting,	which,	by-the-way,	took	place	in	Miss	Halsey's	library	and	music-room, </p>
<p class="calibre1">that	the	unexpected	suddenly	happened,	the	inexplicable	came	to	pass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	were	gathered	about	a	long	table,	with	Mrs.	Smiley	at	one	end	sandwiched</p>
<p class="calibre1">between	 the	 editor	 of	 the	 local	 paper	 and	 myself.	 Behind	 me,	 and	 just	 within reach	of	my	hand,	stood	an	upright	piano,	with	its	cover	down,	but	not	locked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	had	heard	drumming	on	the	table	for	some	time,	and	writing	had	apparently</p>
<p class="calibre1">taken	place	on	the	pads	in	the	middle	of	the	table.	But	all	this	was	inconclusive, </p>
<p class="calibre1">for	the	reason	that	Mrs.	Smiley	was	not	fastened	as	she	is	now.	I	took	it	all	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">pinch	 of	 salt.	 My	 mental	 reservations	 must	 have	 reached	 the	 minds	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">'guides,'	for	with	startling	suddenness	they	left	the	table	and	fell	upon	the	top	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	piano.	After	drumming	for	some	time,	the	invisible	fingers	seemed	to	drop	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 strings	 beneath,	 and	 a	 treble	 note	 was	 sounded	 as	 if	 plucked	 by	 a	 strong hand." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	are	sure	the	piano	was	closed?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 am	 coming	 to	 that.	 Highly	 delighted	 by	 this	 immediate	 response	 to	 my request,	I	said	to	the	'forces':	'Can't	you	demonstrate	to	us	that	these	sounds	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	accidental	or	caused	by	the	jarring	of	cars	in	the	street?	Can't	you	pluck	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bass	strings?'	Instantly,	and	with	clangor,	the	lower	strings	replied.	Thereupon	I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a>said:	'Can't	you	play	a	tune?'	To	this	only	a	confused	jangle	made	answer.	I	was unable	 to	 secure	 any	 orderly	 succession	 of	 notes.	 'Can't	 you	 keep	 time	 while	 I whistle?'	 I	 insisted,	 with	 intent	 to	 show	 that	 intelligence	 guided	 these	 sounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	'spirits'	twanged	three	times	in	the	affirmative,	and	when	I	began	to	whistle</p>
<p class="calibre1">'Yankee	 Doodle'	 the	 invisible	 musician	 kept	 perfect	 time,	 playing	 according	 to my	request—now	on	the	treble,	now	on	the	bass.	Leaning	far	back	in	my	chair,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">placed	my	hand	upon	the	lid	of	the	closed	piano,	and	called	out	to	the	others	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	circle:	'The	lid	of	the	piano	is	closed.	My	hand	is	upon	it.	So	far	as	the	sense</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 touch	 and	 hearing	 are	 concerned,	 we	 have	 here	 an	 action	 absolutely</p>
<p class="calibre1">unaccounted	for	by	any	scientific	law. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This	 was	 at	 the	 moment	 absolutely	 convincing	 to	 me,	 as	 to	 the	 others,	 and	 I promptly	reported	the	case	to	the	American	Psychical	Society	in	Boston.	Since</p>
<p class="calibre1">then	 I	 may	 say	 I	 have	 had	 many	 experiments	 quite	 as	 convincing,	 but	 never	 a repetition	of	this	peculiar	phenomenon.	It	is	useless	to	talk	about	secret	wires,	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	mouse	running	up	and	down	the	strings,	or	any	other	material	explanation	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	fact.	It	took	place	precisely	as	I	relate	it,	and	remains	a	mystery	to	this	day." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fowler	 remained	 very	 calm.	 "Crookes	 saw	 in	 a	 full	 light	 an	 accordion	 playing beneath	the	touch	of	invisible	fingers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,"	 I	 retorted,	 in	 protest,	 "but	 this	 action	 of	 a	 closed	 piano	 happened	 in	 my presence,	under	my	hand,	and	there	is	always	so	much	more	convincing	quality</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 miracle	 which	 happens	 in	 one's	 own	 house.	 But,	 seriously,	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">performance	 on	 the	 closed	 piano	 remains	 a	 profound	 mystification	 to	 me.	 If	 it had	happened	in	the	medium's	house,	or	in	the	home	of	some	one	who	knew	her, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	might	have	suspected	fraud—but	it	did	not!	It	happened	in	the	study	of	one	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	most	respected	women	in	the	city,	a	student	who	did	not	believe	in	psychic</p>
<p class="calibre1">phenomena.	 Furthermore,	 my	 own	 hand	 was	 on	 the	 lid	 of	 the	 piano.	 I	 was	 so</p>
<p class="calibre1">convinced	of	Mrs.	Smiley's	possession	of	some	occult	force	that	I	at	once	wrote</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	society,	telling	them	that	a	study	of	her	phases	would,	in	my	judgment,	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 most	 important	 work	 its	 directors	 could	 engage	 upon.	 This	 is	 one	 of	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">crack	stories,	and	I	wouldn't	believe	it	as	related	by	any	one	else.	However,	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">may	read	my	report,	which	I	made	at	the	time,	if	that	will	be	of	any	satisfaction</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	 I	 don't	 need	 it,"	 responded	 Mr.	 Fowler.	 "I	 was	 merely	 trying	 to	 find	 out what	your	best	experiments	had	been.	Have	they	all	been	on	the	physical	plane?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	 are	 all	 on	 the	 physical	 plane—that	 is	 to	 say,	 on	 one	 plane	 for	 me.	 Any</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a>'spirit	manifestation,'	so	long	as	we	are	what	we	are,	must	be	an	agitation	of	what we	 call	 'molecules	 of	 matter,'	 and	 is	 to	 that	 extent	 physical.	 I	 have	 no	 patience with	those	highfilutin	teachers	who	speak	of	matter	as	though	it	were	ignoble	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	way.	Matter	to	me	is	as	mysterious	as	spirit." </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	this	moment	a	slight	movement	of	the	psychic	arrested	me,	and	as	we	listened</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 silvery	 sweet	 voice	 of	 "Maudie"	 issued	 from	 the	 darkness,	 saying:	 "  <i class="calibre4">Mr. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Mitchell	wants	Mr.	Garland	to	change	places	with	Mr.	Fowler.	Be	very	careful	as</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">you	move	about.	Don't	joggle	mama.	It's	very	dangerous	to	her. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 I	 rose	 to	 comply,	 "Maude"	 called	 out:	 "  <i class="calibre4">Mr.	 Mitchell	 wishes	 the	 threads</i> <i class="calibre4">fastened	to	mama's	wrists.	He	wants	you	and	Mr.	Fowler	to	hold	them	the	way</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">you	did	at	Mr.	Miller's	house. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning	up	the	lights,	we	tied	a	strong	silk	thread	to	each	wrist,	and	passed	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ends	under	each	arm	of	the	chair.	Fowler	took	one	of	these	ends	while	I	retained</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 other.	 I	 then	 called	 the	 attention	 of	 Brierly	 to	 the	 fact	 that	 the	 table	 was seventeen	 inches	 from	 the	 feet	 of	 the	 psychic,	 and	 that	 the	 fastenings	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">unchanged.	When	his	examination	was	completed,	the	lights	were	again	turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">off,	and	the	circuit	of	hands	restored. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Maudie"	 then	 requested	 that	 the	 pieces	 of	 cone	 be	 put	 together	 and	 placed	 on the	 floor	 beside	 the	 table.	 Fowler	 did	 this,	 and	 drew	 a	 chalk	 mark	 about	 it, numbering	it	"Position	No.	1."	Immediately	after	his	return	to	his	seat	the	table was	 strongly	 pushed	 away	 from	 the	 psychic.	 It	 moved	 in	 impulses,	 an	 inch	 or two	at	a	time,	until	it	was	certainly	six	or	eight	inches	farther	from	the	psychic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	impossible	to	conceive	how	this	movement	without	contact	takes	place;	but, </p>
<p class="calibre1">then,	what	do	we	know	about	the	action	of	the	magnet	on	a	pile	of	iron	filings? </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	 can	 a	 thought	 in	 the	 brain	 of	 man	 contract	 a	 set	 of	 muscles	 and	 lift	 a cannon-ball?	At	bottom	we	do	not	know	how	the	will,	as	we	call	it,	crosses	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">chasm	between	mind	and	matter—we	don't	even	know	there	is	a	chasm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	you	feel	any	motion	in	your	thread,	Fowler?"	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothing	but	a	faint	quiver,"	he	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Neither	do	I,	and	yet	the	table	moved." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	table	is	crowding	against	me!"	called	Mrs.	Fowler,	in	some	excitement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fact	that	the	table	moved	toward	us	and	directly	away	from	the	psychic	was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>in	itself	suspicious;	but,	as	a	matter	of	fact,	at	other	sittings	we	obtained	sidewise movements	 of	 the	 table—generally	 to	 the	 left.	 The	 present	 experiment	 did	 not</p>
<p class="calibre1">stand	 alone.	 You	 must	 remember	 also	 that	 the	 table	 was	 at	 this	 time	 more	 than two	 feet	 from	 Mrs.	 Smiley's	 toes,	 her	 dress	 was	 tacked	 to	 the	 floor,	 and	 her ankles	controlled	by	a	tape	whose	ends	were	nailed	to	the	floor	four	feet	behind</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	far	as	matter	can	testify,	Mrs.	Smiley	is	not	concerned	in	this	movement	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	table,"	I	said.	"The	question	is	now	up	to	us.	Which	of	us	is	doing	this?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	am	not,"	answered	Brierly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nor	I,"	declared	Fowler. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nor	I,"	chimed	in	Mrs.	Fowler. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	this	moment	the	psychic	began	to	stir	again.	"Look	out!"	I	called,	warningly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let	every	hand	be	accounted	for.	Some	new	demonstration	is	preparing.	These</p>
<p class="calibre1">periods	of	suffering	are	strangely	like	the	pangs	of	childbirth.	I	wonder	if,	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">all,	Archdeacon	Colley	was	not	in	the	right	when	he	asserted	that	he	had	seen	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">miraculous	issue	of	phantoms.	I	confess	that	when	I	read	it	first	I	smiled	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rest,	for	his	description	of	the	process	was	not	very	poetic.	He	declared	that	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">saw	a	white	vapor	steam	from	the	side	of	the	psychic,	like	vapor	from	a	kettle, </p>
<p class="calibre1">forming	a	little	cloud,	and	from	this	nebulous	mass	various	phantasms	appeared, </p>
<p class="calibre1">ranging	from	a	little	child	to	a	full-grown	man.	It	is	curious	how	exactly	similar</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	the	reports	of	this	process	are.	Crookes	speaks	of	a	milky-white	vapor	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">condensed	to	a	form,	and	Richet	and	Maxwell	describe	it	as	a	sort	of	condensing</p>
<p class="calibre1">process.	I	have	seen	it	myself,	but	could	not	believe	in	the	evidence	of	my	own</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes.	One	can	see	all	kinds	of	things	in	the	dark." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peace	 had	 again	 fallen	 upon	 our	 psychic—the	 peace	 of	 exhaustion;	 as	 if,	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">struggles	being	over,	her	flesh-free	spirit	were	at	large	in	the	room.	The	silence</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	profound,	yet	somehow	thrilling	with	potency. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	this	hush	the	megaphone	was	lifted	slightly	and	dropped,	making	us	all	start. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	as	if	a	feeble	hand	had	tried	to	manipulate	it	without	success.	"Let	us	keep test	conditions,"	I	urged.	"Please	do	not	make	a	movement	now	without	warning</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	 of	 your	 intentions.	 Keep	 the	 circuit	 closed."	 Here	 I	 addressed	 "Wilbur":</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's	 see	 if	 you	 can	 handle	 the	 cone	 under	 strictly	 test	 conditions.	 Come	 now, lift	it!	Lift	it!"	I	repeated	the	command	with	intent	to	concentrate	all	will-power of	both	psychic	and	sitters	upon	the	thing	desired,	as	Maxwell	was	accustomed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a>to	do	in	his	experiments	with	Meurice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several	times	the	forces	strove	to	carry	out	my	wishes,	but	could	not.	Twice	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">horn	 rose	 from	 the	 carpet,	 only	 to	 fall	 back	 helplessly.	 Fowler	 placed	 it	 in position	 each	 time,	 marking	 each	 new	 position,	 while	 I	 took	 note	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">convulsive	 tremor	 which	 swept	 from	 time	 to	 time	 over	 the	 psychic.	 It	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">exactly	 as	 if	 she	 were	 a	 dynamo	 generating	 some	 unknown	 electrical	 energy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which,	after	accumulating	for	a	time	in	her	organism	(as	in	a	jar),	was	discharged</p>
<p class="calibre1">along	 the	 direction	 of	 our	 will,	 and	 yet	 I	 could	 not	 detect	 any	 marked</p>
<p class="calibre1">synchronism	 of	 movement	 between	 these	 impulses	 and	 the	 movement	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">horn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	each	fall	of	the	cone	she	moaned	and	writhed,  <i class="calibre4">but	not	till	the	hush	of	death</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">came	over	her	did	the	horn	move</i>.	So	intense	was	the	silence	each	time	that	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 hear	 the	 slightest	 breath,	 the	 minutest	 movement	 of	 the	 tin	 as	 it	 scraped along	the	rug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	is	useless	to	talk	of	a	confederate,"	I	remarked;	"it	is	of	no	value	to	refer	this action	 to	 the	 hands	 of	 the	 psychic.	 We	 must	 look	 to	 subtler	 causes	 for	 this phenomenon.	 Perhaps	 Maxwell's	 theory	 that	 some	 magnetic	 power	 is	 liberated</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	the	contraction	of	the	larger	muscles	will	account	for	it,	but	in	no	other	way." </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 last	 the	 megaphone	 soared	 into	 the	 air,	 passed	 over	 our	 heads,	 and	 dropped gently	 upon	 the	 table.	 It	 did	 not	 fall	 with	 a	 bang;	 on	 the	 contrary,	 it	 seemed	 to descend	 gently— <i class="calibre4">as	 if	 under	 perfect	 control	 of	 both	 hand	 and	 eye</i>.	 And	 yet	 I assert	there	was	nothing	to	indicate	that	the	psychic	shared	in	these	movements. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	lay	as	still	as	a	corpse.	Nothing	but	a	minute	continuous	tremor	in	the	thread</p>
<p class="calibre1">told	 that	 she	 was	 still	 alive.	 I	 was	 enormously	 impressed	 by	 the	 silence.	 The darkness	 seemed	 athrill	 with	 mystery—not	 the	 mystery	 of	 the	 discarnate	 soul, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 the	 mystery	 of	 the	 X-ray.	 I	 felt	 that	 we	 were	 ourselves	 involved	 in	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">production	of	each	and	every	one	of	these	movements. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	 is	 no	 use	 attempting	 to	 deny	 this	 fact,"	 I	 insisted	 to	 the	 other	 sitters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Either	the	psychic	is	able	to	control	that	cone	by	the	exercise	of	her	will	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	 unknown	 invisible	 force,	 or	 she	 has	 left	 her	 body	 and	 is	 now	 at	 work,	 a sentient	entity	in	the	air	about	us.	There	is	the	same	precision	in	all	this	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lombroso	observed.	It	really	seems	that	the	medium	has	the	faculty	of	using	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">senses	 at	 a	 distance.	 To	 say	 that	 she	 is	 handling	 that	 cone	 with	 her	 ordinary physical	 limbs	 is	 absurd.	 This	 single	 inexplicable	 moving	 of	 a	 mass	 of	 matter from	 A	 to	 B	 makes	 the	 experiments	 of	 Crookes	 and	 Maxwell	 very	 much	 more</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a>vital	to	me.	I	shall	reread	their	books	with	new	interest." </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	result	should	have	awed	me,	but	it	did	not.	I	felt	a	deep	interest,	of	course, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	no	bewilderment.	My	mind	was	perfectly	clear	and	my	senses	alert	to	every</p>
<p class="calibre1">sound,	every	ray	of	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	this	moment	the	psychic	again	began	to	twist	and	turn	as	if	in	pain,	and	at	last</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 little	 voice	 of	 "Maudie"	 anxiously	 asked:	 "  <i class="calibre4">Is	 Mr.	 Garland	 going	 to	 take	 a</i> <i class="calibre4">train	at	seven	o'clock? </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	query	convinced	me	that	deep	in	the	subconscious	mind	of	the	psychic	lay</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 knowledge	 that	 I	 had	 thought	 of	 catching	 this	 train,	 and	 that	 a	 sense	 of	 my plan	 was	 disturbing	 her	 and	 interfering	 with	 our	 experiment.	 To	 remove	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">uneasiness,	 I	 replied:	 "No,	 I	 am	 going	 to	 stay;	 for	 I	 think	 'Mr.	 Mitchell'	 has something	very	special	in	store	for	me.	Tell	her	not	to	think	of	it	any	more.	I	am</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	no	hurry.	I	have	no	appointment	elsewhere." </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	this	"Maudie"	replied:	"  <i class="calibre4">Mr.	Mitchell	says,	'Thank	you';	he	will	do	the	best	he</i> <i class="calibre4">can	for	you.	He	says	go	down-stairs	now	and	get	your	supper.	Leave	mama	just</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">where	she	is.	He	will	take	care	of	her. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	had	been	sitting	for	nearly	three	hours	in	a	dark	close	room	we	welcomed</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	suggestion	from	our	thoughtful	guide,	although	it	tended	to	make	the	sitting</p>
<p class="calibre1">less	 conclusive.	 As	 I	 followed	 my	 hostess	 down	 the	 stairs	 I	 shared	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">remorseful	pity	of	poor	Mrs.	Smiley,	bound	and	helpless	in	her	inquisitorial	seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mitchell"	did	not	ask	that	she	be	fed,	only	that	she	be	covered	with	a	shawl	to keep	her	warm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	she	is	doing	this	for	her	own	entertainment,"	I	said,	"she	has	singular	tastes.	If she	 is	 doing	 it	 to	 advance	 the	 cause	 of	 spiritualism,	 she	 is	 a	 noble	 creature—</p>
<p class="calibre1">though	a	mistaken	devotee,	in	the	eyes	of	Miller." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	 hostess's	 uneasiness	 concerning	 the	 psychic	 made	 the	 meal	 a	 hurried	 one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">None	of	us	felt	very	much	like	eating,	and	I	could	see	that	Fowler	was	disposed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	cut	corners.	"Well,	Garland,	what	do	you	intend	to	do	with	the	facts	obtained</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	 afternoon?	 You	 have	 plenty	 of	 authority	 behind	 which	 to	 shelter	 yourself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why	 not	 admit	 the	 truth?	 So	 far	 as	 I	 am	 concerned,	 I	 am	 willing	 to	 swear	 that Mrs.	Smiley	had	no	actual	hand	in	the	movement	of	the	cone." </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	 this	 I	 replied:	 "From	 one	 point	 of	 view,	 these	 phenomena	 are	 slight;	 but considered	 in	 the	 light	 of	 the	 manifestation	 of	 a	 totally	 new	 force,	 they	 are</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a>tremendous	in	their	implication,	and	I	must	be	absolutely	sure	of	them	before	I assert	their	truth.	The	most	impressive	fact	of	all	is	that	every	phenomenon	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">obtain	 coheres	 with	 those	 obtained	 by	 Maxwell,	 Crookes,	 and	 Flammarion.	 It</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	not	do	to	admit	the	spirit	hypothesis,	or	grant	the	objectivity	of	phantasms, </p>
<p class="calibre1">merely	because	we	have	proved	the	movements	of	a	particle	of	matter	from	A	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">B	without	a	known	push	or	a	pull,	for	such	admission	is	far-reaching.	If	Maxwell</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 right,	 these	 phenomena—even	 the	 most	 complicated	 of	 them—are</p>
<p class="calibre1">metapsychical,	but	perfectly	normal.	For	example,	he	says:	'A	movement	without</p>
<p class="calibre1">contact	was	forthcoming	this	afternoon.	I	placed	a	table	upside	down	on	a	linen</p>
<p class="calibre1">sheet.	 M.	 Meurice	 and	 I	 then	 put	 our	 hands	 on	 the	 sheet,	 some	 distance	 away from	the	table.	The	table	turned	completely	over.	The	movement	was	performed</p>
<p class="calibre1">slowly	 and	 gently.	 It	 was	 four	 o'clock	 in	 the	 afternoon,	 and	 the	 sunlight	 was streaming	 in	 through	 an	 open	 window.'	 Now	 here	 was	 a	 perfectly	 clear	 case	 of telekinesis,	with	no	one	present	but	Dr.	Maxwell	and	his	friend;	but	the	turning</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	of	the	table	does	not	imply	the	action	of	spirit	hands." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a>"I	don't	see	why	not,"	responded	Mrs.	Fowler,	"if	Dr.	Maxwell	had	mediumistic power." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	was	Meurice	who	had	the	power;	but	it	was	a	physical	power,	which	went	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 his	 organism	 like	 heat.	 He	 was	 often	 ill	 after	 his	 experiments,	 and	 felt nausea	 and	 a	 disturbing	 weakness	 in	 the	 solar	 plexus,	 as	 though	 his	 bodily</p>
<p class="calibre1">powers	had	been	seriously	drawn	upon.	I	have	felt	this	myself—or	so	it	seemed; </p>
<p class="calibre1">perhaps	I	imagined	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fowler	struck	in:	"But	what	will	you	do	with	materializations	such	as	Dr.	Richet</p>
<p class="calibre1">studied	at	the	Villa	Carmen	in	Algiers?	What	will	you	do	with	the	photographs</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	spectre	of	the	helmeted	soldier	which	he	obtained	under	what	he	declares</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	test	conditions?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	were	they?	That's	the	point." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 am	 willing	 to	 trust	 a	 man	 of	 Richet's	 wide	 knowledge	 and	 known	 skill	 in experimentation.	 When	 he	 says	 he	 saw,	 touched,	 and	 heard	 the	 apparition	 of	 a man,	 I	 am	 ready	 to	 believe	 that	 he	 had	 taken	 quite	 as	 many	 precautions	 as	 his newspaper	critics	would	have	done.	He	saw	a	helmeted	soldier	leave	the	séance</p>
<p class="calibre1">cabinet	and	walk	about.	He	clasped	his	hand,	he	affirmed,	and	found	it	warm	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">jointed	 (perfectly	 real),	 and	 he	 secured	 the	 breath	 of	 this	 phantom	 in	 a	 tube	 of baryta	 so	 unmistakably	 that	 the	 liquid	 was	 chemically	 changed	 in	 accordance</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 his	 test.	 There	 are	 thousands	 of	 other	 well-authenticated	 cases	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">materialization.	 I	 have	 seen	 scores	 of	 them	 myself.	 I	 am	 only	 quoting	 Richet because	I	know	you	believe	in	his	methods." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	do,	indeed;	but	he	may	have	been	deceived,	all	the	same.	The	failure	of	all	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">experiments	in	Algiers	lay	in	the	fact	that	he	was	never	able	to	nail	his	psychic</p>
<p class="calibre1">down,	as	we	have	done.	He	was	the	on-looker,	after	all—not	the	experimenter	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">should	have	been	and	wished	to	be.	Really	his	photographs	of	the	spirit	'B.	B.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">have	not	the	weight	as	evidence	of	the	physical	manifestation,	as	the	phenomena</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	we	have	this	evening	secured." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fowler	rose.	"I	have	his	report	in	my	library.	Let	me	get	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	returned	in	a	few	minutes	with	a	small	blue	book	in	his	hand,	from	which	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">began	to	read	with	gusto:	"'I	saw,	as	it	were,	a	white	luminous	ball	floating	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	floor;	then	rising	straight	upward,	very	rapidly,	as	though	issuing	from	a	trap-</p>
<p class="calibre1">door,	 appeared	 B.	 B.,	 born,	 so	 to	 speak,	 out	 of	 the	 flooring	 outside	 the	 curtain, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a>which	had	not	stirred.	He	tries,	as	it	seems	to	me,	to	come	among	us,	but	he	has	a limping,	 hesitating	 gait.	 At	 one	 moment	 he	 reels	 as	 if	 about	 to	 fall,	 limping	 on one	 leg;	 then	 he	 goes	 toward	 the	 opening	 of	 the	 curtains	 of	 the	 cabinet.	 Then, without	 (as	 I	 believe)	 opening	 the	 curtains,	 he	 sinks	 down,	 disappears	 into	 the floor.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	are	you	reading	from?"	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 am	 reading	 from	 the	 report	 which	 Richet	 made	 to	 the	 Annals	 of	 Psychical Science.	He	goes	on	to	say:	'It	appears	to	me	that	this	experiment	is	decisive,	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	formation	of	a	luminous	spot	on	the	ground,	which	then	changes	into	a	living</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	walking	being,	cannot	seemingly	be	produced	by	any	trick.	On	the	day	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	experiment	I	minutely	examined	the	flagstones	[which	made	up	the	floor	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 séance	 room],	 and	 also	 the	 coach-house	 and	 stable	 immediately	 under	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">part	of	the	kiosque.'	There	was	no	trap-door,	and	the	cobwebs	on	the	roof	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">stable	 were	 undisturbed.	 The	 photographs	 of	 the	 apparition	 were	 taken	 on	 five different	plates	simultaneously,	and	the	figure	is	the	same	on	each." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes;	but	those	experiments	were	afterward	made	of	no	value	by	the	confession</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	a	coachman,	who	admitted	his	complicity	in	the	fraud." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No;	that	story	is	not	true.	The	experiments	stand,	and	Richet	still	defends	both</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself	and	the	circle	against	the	charge	of	fraud." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	read	on,"	I	insisted.	"Does	he	not	say	that,	in	spite	of	all	his	proof,	he	will not	even	hazard	an	affirmation	of	the	phenomena?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	he	does	say	that,"	admitted	Fowler;	"but	he	also	says:	'I	have	thought	it	my duty	 to	 mention	 these	 facts	 in	 the	 same	 way	 as	 Sir	 William	 Crookes	 thought	 it his	 duty	 in	 more	 difficult	 times	 to	 report	 the	 history	 of	 "Katie	 King."	 I	 do	 not believe	 I	 have	 been	 deceived.	 I	 am	 convinced	 that	 I	 have	 been	 present	 at</p>
<p class="calibre1">realities,	not	deceptions.	Certainly	I	cannot	say	in	what	materialization	consists.  <i class="calibre4">I</i> <i class="calibre4">am	 only	 ready	 to	 maintain	 that	 there	 is	 something	 profoundly	 mysterious	 in	 it,</i> <i class="calibre4">which	will	change	from	top	to	bottom	our	ideas	on	nature	and	on	life. </i>'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	apparently	was	profoundly	affected	by	what	he	saw,"	I	assented,	"and	I	am perfectly	willing	to	grant	that	the	character	of	his	friends	in	the	circle	add	value</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	what	he	saw.	But,	after	all,	the	fact	of	materialization	is	so	tremendous	in	its</p>
<p class="calibre1">implications	that	even	to	admit	its	possibility	is	to	admit	more	than	any	man	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	day,	who	has	been	trained	in	scientific	ways,	is	willing	to	be	answerable	for. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,	 the	 most	 extraordinary	 story	 I	 have	 ever	 read	 is	 that	 of	 Archdeacon</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>Colley,	Rector	of	Stockton,	Warwickshire,	who	declared	in	a	public	lecture—and many	 times	 since,	 over	 his	 signature—that	 he	 saw	 the	 miraculous	 issue	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">phantoms	 born	 directly	 from	 the	 side	 of	 a	 psychic.	 He	 declares	 he	 saw	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">winsome	 little	 girl	 emerge—a	 laughing,	 golden-haired	 creature,	 as	 alive	 as	 any one.	I	confess	that	this	is	too	much	for	me,	and	yet	if	a	Spanish	soldier	can	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">born	from	a	spot	of	light,	anything	at	all	that	anybody	may	imagine	can	happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">—But	let	us	return	to	our	own	psychics." </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 found	 Mrs.	 Smiley	 sitting	 precisely	 as	 we	 left	 her,	 and,	 picking	 up	 our</p>
<p class="calibre1">thread,	Fowler	and	I	located	the	table	and	the	cone	and	reassumed	our	positions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	table,	which	was	quite	out	of	reach	of	Mrs.	Smiley's	hands,	now	stood	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">its	end	toward	the	three	of	us,	sitting	in	a	crescent	shape	opposite	the	psychic—a</p>
<p class="calibre1">position	which	produced,	so	the	guides	said,	one	pole	of	a	battery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hardly	 were	 we	 seated	 in	 our	 places	 when	 the	 psychic	 suddenly	 awoke	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">spoke	 in	 her	 natural	 voice,	 and	 I	 for	 one	 felt	 that	 the	 sitting	 was	 over.	 I	 was perfectly	 certain	 that	 nothing	 could	 happen	 out	 of	 the	 ordinary	 unless	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">medium	were	in	either	one	or	the	other	of	her	states	of	trance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 was	 now	 both	 amazed	 and	 delighted	 to	 find	 that	 the	 cone	 could	 be	 drummed upon	and	voices	delivered	through	it	while	Mrs.	Smiley,	mentally	normal,	took</p>
<p class="calibre1">part	 in	 the	 conversation.	 My	 theories	 were	 upset.	 I	 was	 completely	 mystified, though	I	said	nothing	of	this	to	Fowler. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	 or	 twice	 Mrs.	 Fowler	 declared	 she	 heard	 the	 sound	 of	 lips,	 and	 at	 last	 a voice	came	to	her	speaking	the	name	of	her	father.	His	voice	answered	some	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	questions	correctly,	but	could	not	utter	the	pet	name	which	her	father	used	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">call	 her.	 This	 breakdown	 of	 the	 individuality	 of	 the	 phantom	 voices	 is	 very</p>
<p class="calibre1">characteristic.	 This	 ended	 the	 sitting.	 The	 voices	 had	 not	 been	 as	 strong	 as	 we had	 hoped	 for,	 but	 as	 we	 threw	 on	 the	 light	 we	 found	 a	 number	 of	 messages written	upon	the	sheets	of	paper	which	Fowler	had	put	in	the	middle	of	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These	messages	were	lying	with	the	writing	wrong	side	up,	so	far	as	the	psychic</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 concerned.	 Altogether	 we	 felt	 that	 the	 results	 were	 both	 significant	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">encouraging,	and	we	agreed	to	meet	three	days	later	in	the	same	room	and	under</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	same	conditions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	I	want	to	do	now	is	to	hold	your	arms	while	the	horn	is	in	the	air,	or	while</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	writing	is	going	on,"	I	said	to	Mrs.	Smiley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 to	 this	 she	 replied:	 "You	 may	 make	 any	 test	 you	 please.	 I	 feel	 that	 in	 this house	my	powers	will	return." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>"That	is	a	real	gain,"	I	said,	to	encourage	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a><b class="calibre3">VI</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	sitting	was	an	almost	exact	duplication	of	the	last	so	far	as	the	binding</p>
<p class="calibre1">(and	nailing)	of	the	psychic	was	concerned,	except	that	we	sewed	 <i class="calibre4">two</i>	bands	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">tape	 to	 her	 sleeves	 and	  <i class="calibre4">four</i>	 tacks	 were	 used	 at	 each	 wrist.	 Her	 feet	 were	 tied separately	 in	 the	 middle	 of	 a	 long	 tape,	 and	 the	 ends	 brought	 together,	 carried back	 beneath	 her	 chair,	 and	 tacked	 to	 the	 floor.	 As	 before,	 we	 placed	 the	 large end	 of	 the	 cone	 on	 the	 floor,	 out	 of	 her	 reach,	 leaving	 the	 smaller	 end	 on	 the table,	which	we	left	just	out	of	her	utmost	reach.	On	the	table	we	placed	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">sheets	of	paper	specially	marked	and	dated,	and	took	our	seats	as	usual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	one	was	present	at	this	sitting	but	Mr.	and	Mrs.	Fowler	and	myself.	Even	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">faithful	Brierly	had	been	unable	to	share	in	this,	the	twenty-ninth	experiment.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 delighted	 to	 have	 the	 circle	 narrow	 down,	 for	 Fowler	 was	 a	 good</p>
<p class="calibre1">investigator	 and	 a	 man	 of	 vast	 experience	 in	 psychic	 matters.	 Outside</p>
<p class="calibre1">interference	 was	 absolutely	 excluded.	 "Whatever	 happens	 to-night,	 Fowler,"	 I said,	"you	and	I	or	the	spirits	must	be	responsible	for	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 began,	 as	 usual,	 by	 putting	 Mrs.	 Smiley	 into	 hypnotic	 sleep.	 In	 a	 few</p>
<p class="calibre1">moments	the	familiar	shuddering	action	took	place.	Her	palms	grew	moist.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	she	found	it	difficult	to	submit	to	our	touch.	She	asked	us	to	put	our	fingers</p>
<p class="calibre1">above	 hers,	 and	 soon	 after,	 in	 the	 midst	 of	 our	 singing,	 her	 voice	 ceased,	 her hands	grew	heavy	as	lead,	and	lay	perfectly	limp	and	dead	in	their	bonds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again	 following	 the	 guidance	 of	 the	 raps,	 Fowler	 and	 I	 moved	 back	 and	 sat</p>
<p class="calibre1">opposite	 her,	 with	 Mrs.	 Fowler	 between	 us.	 "Maudie"	 then	 spoke	 from	 the psychic's	lips,	asking	us	to	move	the	table	farther	away.	This	I	did,	leaving	it	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">least	twelve	inches	from	the	utmost	tips	of	her	fingers.	"Maudie"	then	asked	us to	take	up	the	larger	half	of	the	cone	and	unite	it	with	the	smaller	part,	and	lay</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	entire	cone	flat	across	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	did	so,	marking	its	position	by	means	of	chalk.	It	was	nearly	three	feet	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 utmost	 extension	 of	 the	 psychic's	 hands,	 and	 yet,	 almost	 immediately, </p>
<p class="calibre1">tapping	 came	 upon	 the	 cone	 keeping	 time	 to	 our	 singing.	 Later,	 sounds	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">produced	like	the	beating	of	a	kettle-drum.	A	hammering	was	then	carried	on	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	within	the	cone,	and	"Maudie"	spoke,	telling	us	to	go	down	and	get	supper,	as before. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a>I	 regretted	 this	 necessity	 very	 much,	 for	 up	 to	 this	 moment	 all	 had	 been	 clear sailing;	 the	 tapping	 on	 the	 cone	 was	 inexplicable	 on	 the	 basis	 of	 any	 normal action	of	the	psychic;	but	to	leave	her	alone,	even	while	so	well	accounted	for, </p>
<p class="calibre1">weakened	the	test. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 said	 as	 much	 to	 Fowler	 as	 we	 sat	 at	 the	 dinner-table.	 He	 admitted	 his	 own disappointment.	 "However,"	 he	 added,	 philosophically,	 "we	 have	 to	 take	 these things	as	they	offer.	We	can't	construct	them." </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 discussed	 the	 implications	 of	 the	 sittings	 we	 had	 already	 held.	 "It	 isn't	 one thing	 only,"	 he	 reminded	 me;	 "it	 is	 because	 of	 the	 larger	 fact	 that	 one phenomenon	 supports	 another	 that	 one	 comes	 to	 believe.	 Thus	 far	 to-night	 we</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 <i class="calibre4">proved</i>	that	Mrs.	Smiley	is	not	concerned	with	the	drumming	on	the	cone, </p>
<p class="calibre1">haven't	we?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes;	 but	 I	 want	 to	 hold	 her	 hands	 while	 the	 drumming	 takes	 place.	 I	 want	 to hear	her	voice	at	the	same	time	with	'Mitchell's.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We'll	 get	 it,"	 he	 responded,	 confidently.	 And	 a	 little	 later	 we	 returned	 to	 the room	where	our	psychic	was	sitting,	still	in	deep	trance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	some	moments	of	waiting,	"Maudie"	said:	"Mr.	Mitchell	says	take	the	table away	and	put	the	cone	in	its	place." </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	moved	the	table	a	short	distance	to	the	left,	and	I	put	the	cone	in	the	centre	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 rug	 where	 the	 table	 had	 stood,	 and	 marked	 the	 position	 of	 the	 cone.	 The psychic	 then	 passed	 through	 a	 period	 of	 suffering,	 of	 effort,	 but	 nothing	 took place.	 Again	 "Maudie"	 spoke,	 asking	 us	 to	 restore	 the	 table	 and	 cone	 to	 their former	positions.	"Evidently	the	experiment	designed	by	'Mitchell'	has	failed,"	I said,	"but	these	failures	instruct	us." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	convulsive	restlessness	again	seized	upon	the	psychic,	and	"Maudie"	asked	us to	 sing.	 I	 hummed	 softly,	 in	 order	 to	 hear	 anything	 that	 might	 take	 place.	 A minute	 clicking	 sound	 at	 once	 developed,	 as	 though	 some	 one	 were	 lightly</p>
<p class="calibre1">beating	 the	 cone	 with	 a	 key.	 These	 clicks	 answered	 our	 questions.	 It	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wilbur"	once	more.	I	asked	him	if	he	were	going	to	be	able	to	speak	to	us,	and he	tapped	"  <i class="calibre4">Yes</i>."	Soon	after	this	the	cone	was	swung	into	the	air	and	"Wilbur's" </p>
<p class="calibre1">throaty	 whisper	 was	 heard.	 I	 asked	 him	 if	 the	 psychic	 could	 not	 be	 awake	 and speak	while	he	was	present,	and	he	answered:	"  <i class="calibre4">Yes;	we	have	planned	that. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	as	he	spoke	Mrs.	Smiley	passed	into	what	seemed	like	a	struggle	for	breath</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a>and	awoke! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are	you	with	us,	Mrs.	Smiley?"	asked	Fowler. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes.	What	time	is	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"About	half-past	eight.	How	do	you	feel?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Very	numb	and	cold,"	she	answered,	plaintively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	wonder	at	that,"	I	remarked.	"You've	been	sitting	there	for	five	hours." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	anybody	present?"	she	asked,	anxiously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 knew	 what	 she	 meant,	 and	 answered:	 "Yes,	 'Wilbur'	 is	 here—or	 was	 a	 few moments	ago.	Are	you	still	with	us,	'Wilbur'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	rapping	on	the	cone	made	vigorous	answer,	and	a	few	seconds	later	the	cone</p>
<p class="calibre1">took	 flight	 and	 "Wilbur's"	 voice	 resumed	 general	 conversation	 with	 us.	 It	 was noticeable	 to	 me	 all	 through	 this	 sitting,	 as	 at	 others,	 that	 neither	 "Wilbur"	 nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mitchell"	nor	"Maud"	ever	addressed	the	psychic;  <i class="calibre4">they	spoke	of	her,	but	never</i> <i class="calibre4">to	her</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	requested	further	tests.	"'Wilbur,'	I	want	the	privilege	of	going	to	the	psychic's side.	I	don't	like	this	long-distance	experiment.	I	want	to	get	closer	to	these	facts</p>
<p class="calibre1">—if	they	are	facts." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">You	shall	have	the	privilege</i>,"	was	the	reassuring	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shall	I	go	now?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	no	reply	through	the	horn,	but	a	tapping	on	the	table	gave	a	doubtful</p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">Yes</i>,"	and	I	crept	slowly	forward	and	took	a	seat	at	Mrs.	Smiley's	right	hand.	"I am	very	close	to	the	ultimate	mystery,	Mrs.	Smiley,"	I	said,	as	I	placed	my	hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon	her	wrist.	"Proceed,	'Wilbur.'	Let	me	hear	your	voice	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 tense	 expectation,	 I	 put	 my	 ear	 close	 to	 the	 psychic's	 lips	 and	 listened breathlessly.	The	horn	soared	into	the	air	and	was	drummed	there,	as	if	to	show</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	it	was	out	of	the	reach	of	the	psychic,	but	no	voice	came	from	it!	This	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappointment	to	me,	as	well	as	to	Fowler,	and	I	banteringly	said:	"You	know</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	failure	is	suspicious,	Wilbur.'	It	seems	to	indicate	that	Mrs.	Smiley	is	only	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">wonderful	ventriloquist,	after	all.	Can't	you	prove	that	she	is	independent	of	your</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice?	Can't	you	do	something	decisive	at	this	moment?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a>No	 reply	 came	 to	 this;	 but	 while	 my	 hand	 was	 firmly	 pressed	 upon	 her	 wrist (both	 sleeves	 being	 nailed	 to	 the	 chair),	 the	 loose	 leaves	 of	 the	 paper	 in	 the centre	of	the	table	were	whisked	away	to	the	left.	I	could	follow	their	flight,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	all	heard	their	deposition	on	a	couch	in	a	corner	of	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fowler,"	I	said,	"are	you	controlling	your	wife's	hands?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes;	we	had	nothing	to	do	with	that	noise." </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 was	 another	 tense	 moment,	 for	 the	 movement	 of	 those	 papers	 was	 very</p>
<p class="calibre1">ghostly	 indeed.	 We	 had	 demonstrated	 clearly	 that	 their	 movement	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">supernormal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"May	I	come	forward?"	asked	Fowler. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tap—"  <i class="calibre4">No</i>,"	was	the	decided	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	then	asked:	"'Wilbur,'	do	you	want	me	to	change	with	Fowler	and	control	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fowler's	hands?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	emphatic	"  <i class="calibre4">Yes</i>"	was	rapped	in	reply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	seem	as	anxious	for	a	conclusive	test	as	we	are,"	remarked	Fowler.	"Did you	mean	you	didn't	want	Mrs.	Fowler	unaccounted	for?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	perfect	fusillade	of	raps	followed:	"  <i class="calibre4">Yes,	yes,	yes. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fowler	 then	 came	 forward	 to	 Mrs.	 Smiley's	 left,	 while	 I	 returned	 to	 the	 table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking	 both	 of	 Mrs.	 Fowler's	 hands	 in	 mine,	 and	 setting	 the	 toes	 of	 my	 shoes upon	hers,	I	awaited	developments.	At	this	moment,	while	Fowler	was	pressing</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 psychic's	 imprisoned	 wrists,	 the	 cone	 banged	 about	 most	 furiously, </p>
<p class="calibre1">describing	 wide	 circles	 entirely	 out	 of	 Mrs.	 Smiley's	 reach.	 This	 action	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">another	 perfectly	 convincing	 test	 of	 the	 psychic's	 supernormal	 powers.	 As	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same	movement	had	taken	place	with	 <i class="calibre4">each</i>	of	us	in	control	of	the	psychic,	each</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	absolved	from	any	complicity	in	the	matter;	but	I	did	not	forget	my	further</p>
<p class="calibre1">test.	"Mrs.	Smiley,"	I	said,	"I	want	Mr.	Fowler	to	return	to	his	seat,	and	I	want	to place	my	hand	over	your	lips—or	to	muffle	you	in	some	way.  <i class="calibre4">I	must</i>	prove	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	have	nothing	to	do	with	the	production	of	those	voices.	Will	you	permit	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">test?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Certainly,"	she	answered,	with	patient	sweetness.	"You	may	gag	me	in	any	way you	 please.	 I	 am	 perfectly	 sure	 you	 can	 secure	 the	 proof	 you	 want."	 Upon	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a>hint	I	acted.	Taking	a	large	kerchief	from	my	pocket,	I	tied	it	tightly	around	her mouth,	knotting	it	at	the	back,	and	then,	in	growing	excitement,	challenged	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ghostly	voice:	"Now,	'Wilbur,'	let's	hear	from	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	moment	later	the	voice	came	from	the	cone,	but	apparently	very	much	muffled</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	blurred.	"You	are	not	articulating	well,"	I	rather	sarcastically	observed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instantly	 the	 voice	 came	 out	 clearly,	 more	 sharply	 than	 ever	 before.	 "  <i class="calibre4">I	 was</i> <i class="calibre4">fooling	you! </i>"	jeered	"Wilbur." </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 all	 applauded.	 "There,	 that's	 better,"	 I	 said.	 "Your	 voice	 improved wonderfully." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wilbur"	 chuckled	 with	 glee.	 "  <i class="calibre4">I've	 taken	 a	 lozenge</i>,"	 he	 whimsically	 retorted, expressing	a	very	human	delight	in	our	mystification. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fowler	 then	 said:	 "Now	 let's	 consider	 this	 a	 moment,	 Garland.	 Suppose	 Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Smiley	has	been	able	to	loosen	the	gag.	How	does	she	handle	the	cone?	We	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">suppose	she	is	a	marvellous	ventriloquist.	How	does	she	write	on	the	pads	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">table,	 and	 how	 does	 she	 whisk	 them	 away?	 You	 see,	 it	 isn't	 the	 matter	 of	 one thing,	but	of	all	that	has	happened." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	I	admit	that	everything	points	to	an	exercise	of	supernormal	force.	It	really looks,	 so	 far	 as	 anything	 in	 the	 dark	 can	 look,	 like	 spirits,	 but	 I	 prefer	 to	 think Mrs.	Smiley	has	the	power	to	project	her	will	in	some	way." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	see	how	we	are	going	to	escape	the	spirit	hypothesis,"	replied	Fowler. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Mitchell,'"	I	said,	addressing	the	phantom,	"I	want	to	examine	that	gag,	and	I want	to	hold	both	hands	of	the	psychic.	Will	you	permit	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	no	reply	to	this,	and	Fowler	offered	an	explanation:	"We	had	that	test</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	a	previous	sitting." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 explained	 to	 the	 invisible	 ones:	 "'Wilbur,'	 it	 is	 absolutely	 essential	 that	 you should	prove	to	me	that	your	voice	is	not	dependent	upon	the	vocal	chords	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">psychic.	You	see	the	importance	of	this,	do	you	not,	Mrs.	Smiley?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Indeed,	 I	 do,"	 she	 earnestly	 answered,	 her	 voice	 sounding	 very	 faint	 and muffled	through	the	kerchief.	"I	am	anxious	for	the	test." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Very	well,	then.	Now	I	want	you	to	sing	a	song,	and	while	you	are	singing	I	am</p>
<p class="calibre1">going	to	insist	on	'Wilbur's'	speaking.	Will	you	do	that,	'Wilbur'?"	The	cone	was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a>drummed	upon	as	if	in	vigorous	promise	of	success. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	 Smiley	 sang,	 or	 rather	 hummed;	 but	 there	 was	 no	 response	 on	 the	 part	 of the	 ghostly	 voices,	 and	 a	 moment	 later	 she	 called,	 faintly:	 "The	 kerchief	 is slipping	down,	Mr.	Garland." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rose	and	went	to	her	side.	As	I	untied	the	kerchief,	she	said,	plaintively:	"I	am sorry	 we	 didn't	 get	 the	 voices.	 I	 am	 sure	 we	 can	 if	 we	 try	 again.	 Please	 try again."	And	a	vigorous	drumming	on	the	cone	seemed	to	second	her	plea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,	it	was	getting	very	late,	and	I	said:	"I	think	we	will	postpone	further</p>
<p class="calibre1">experiment	to-night.	What	are	your	sensations	now?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	am	almost	paralyzed,	and	still	deaf,	too,	but	that	often	happens.	My	feet	are	as if	they	did	not	exist." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	your	mind	is	perfectly	normal?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	it	seems	to	be." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon	after	this	I	returned	to	my	seat;	the	cone	was	lifted	high	into	the	air	silently, </p>
<p class="calibre1">broken	 apart,	 and	 then,	 with	 the	 small	 end	 jangling	 inside	 the	 larger	 one,	 was carried	over	the	table	and	back	to	the	floor.	It	fell	with	a	bang	that	seemed	final</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	decisive.	"That	is	'good-bye,'"	said	Mrs.	Smiley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon	lighting	the	gas	we	found	our	victim	as	before,	sitting	absolutely	as	we	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">left	 her.	 The	 table	 edge	 was	 twenty-four	 inches	 from	 her	 finger-tips.	 The	 place where	the	cone	lay,	which	we	had	marked	with	chalk	when	it	was	first	drummed</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon,	was	thirty-six	inches	from	one	hand	and	forty	inches	from	the	other.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 most	 inexplicable	 of	 all—the	 tangible,	 permanent	 record—was	 the	 seven</p>
<p class="calibre1">sheets	of	paper	which	were	lying	upon	a	couch	six	feet	from	Mrs.	Smiley's	left</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand.  <i class="calibre4">They	were	all	written	upon	legibly,	and	pinned	together	with	a	black	pin, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">which	 had	 been	 thrust	 through	 the	 writing. </i>	 "Wilbur"	 had	 scrawled	 his	 name, Mrs.	 Fowler's	 father's	 name	 was	 signed	 to	 a	 message,	 and	 there	 were	 other</p>
<p class="calibre1">signatures	unknown	to	any	of	us.	The	pencil	was	on	the	carpet,	forty	inches	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Smiley's	hand.	The	leaves	of	paper,	at	the	moment	when	they	were	grasped</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	lifted,	were	more	than	forty	inches	from	her	finger-tips.	How	this	was	done	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	not	know:	but	of	this	I	am	absolutely	sure:	the	psychic	did	not	remove	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 the	 table	 by	 means	 of	 her	 ordinary,	 material	 limbs.	 Barring	 the	 failure	 to disassociate	 her	 voice	 from	 that	 of	 "Wilbur,"	 she	 had	 met	 every	 demand	 upon her.	Her	powers	were	truly	magical.	I	cannot	say	I	 <i class="calibre4">saw</i>	the	cone	move,	but	I	have</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a>proven	that	the	psychic	did	not	surreptitiously	touch	it	or	fraudulently	write	upon the	 papers	 during	 this	 sitting.	 I	 cannot	 swear	 that	 Fowler	 was	 controlling	 his wife's	 hands	 while	 the	 cone	 was	 floating	 (and	 while	 I	 held	 the	 psychic's</p>
<p class="calibre1">imprisoned	hands),	but	I	 <i class="calibre4">believe</i>	he	was.	In	short,	barring	the	one	sense	of	sight</p>
<p class="calibre1">—an	all-important	one,	I	admit—these	happenings	were	convincing	and	fitted	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	phenomena	which	I	had	secured	with	other	psychics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless,	I	was	not	satisfied.	I	wanted	Brierly,	or	some	other	fifth	person,	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 room,	 in	 order	 that	  <i class="calibre4">both</i>	 of	 the	 psychic's	 hands	 could	 be	 controlled	 at	 the same	 time	 that	 Mrs.	 Fowler's	 were	 secured.	 So	 long	 as	 a	 single	 hand	 was	 left free,	the	doubter	would	be	warranted	in	questioning	our	results. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	two	or	three	sittings	were	partial	failures—so	much	so	that	I	made	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">record	of	them.	Possibly,	conditions	were	not	strict	enough.	At	any	rate,	the	final</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	most	conclusive	sitting	came	three	days	later.	It	was	held	in	Fowler's	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	followed	the	conditions	of	the	previous	sitting	very	closely—the	same	room, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	same	table,	the	same	fastenings	as	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	present	a	friend	of	Fowler's,	a	young	man	who	was	possessed	of	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">psychic	 power.	 We	 will	 call	 him	 Frank.	 Fowler	 and	 I	 took	 entire	 charge	 of	 the psychic,	and	her	bonds	were	even	more	carefully	nailed	than	before.	We	began</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	séance,	as	before,	by	putting	her	to	sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	long	after	"Maudie"	spoke,	saying:	"  <i class="calibre4">Mr.	Mitchell	wishes	the	thread	fastened</i> <i class="calibre4">to	mama's	hands	in	the	way	Mr.	Garland	desires. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 fastened	 a	 strong	 thread	 to	 each	 wrist	 as	 I	 had	 done	 several	 times	 before, passing	 the	 ends	 under	 the	 chair-arm	 in	 such	 wise	 that	 any	 movement	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">psychic	would	be	plainly	and	instantly	detected.	We	then	returned	to	our	seats, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and,	though	conditions	seemed	favorable,	no	marked	phenomena	took	place;	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cone	was	lifted,	it	is	true,	but	we	were	used	to	this	now,	and	accepted	it	as	quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">commonplace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 six	 o'clock	 the	 voice	 of	 "Maudie"	 came:	 "  <i class="calibre4">Please	 go	 down	 to	 supper.	 Mr. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Mitchell	says	he	will	be	able	to	give	you	what	you	ask	for	after	you	return. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	did	not	ask	to	what	he	referred,	but	I	had	in	mind	the	test	to	prove	the	voices</p>
<p class="calibre1">independent	 of	 the	 psychic's	 vocal	 organs,	 and	 at	 the	 dinner	 we	 discussed</p>
<p class="calibre1">methods	by	which	this	could	be	made	clear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	 they	 will	 let	 me	 put	 my	 hand	 over	 her	 mouth,"	 I	 said	 to	 Fowler,	 "I	 will	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a>satisfied." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	you	mean	that	you	will	believe	in	spirits?"	he	smilingly	challenged	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	 I	 won't	 go	 so	 far	 as	 to	 promise	 that,	 but	 I	 confess	 it	 would	 help	 to	 prove their	existence." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	may	be	about	to	get	something	more	conclusive	than	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let	 us	 fix	 our	 minds	 on	 two	 things:	 first,	 to	 get	 the	 writing,	 or	 at	 least movement,	with	every	hand	controlled;	and,	second,	the	voices,	while	one	of	us</p>
<p class="calibre1">covers	Mrs.	Smiley's	mouth	with	a	hand." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Very	well,"	acquiesced	Fowler.	"But	the	unexpected	is	what	usually	happens	in these	performances." </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	were	gone	but	twenty	minutes,	so	eager	were	we	for	our	demonstration.	We</p>
<p class="calibre1">found	 everything	 quite	 as	 when	 we	 left:	 the	 psychic	 was	 asleep,	 the	 fastenings undisturbed.	 Fowler	 and	 I	 regained	 our	 threads	 and	 resumed	 our	 places	 at	 the sides	 of	 the	 table,	 while	 Frank	 and	 Mrs.	 Fowler	 sat	 close	 together	 at	 the	 end opposite	 Mrs.	 Smiley.	 I	 ask	 the	 reader	 to	 recall	 that	 the	 psychic's	 ankles	 were encircled	with	tape	which	was	nailed	to	the	floor	behind	her	chair.	Two	bands	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">tape,	 after	 being	 sewn	 to	 her	 cuffs,	 had	 been	 tacked	 solidly	 to	 the	 chair,	 three strong	tacks	were	driven	down	through	the	hem	of	her	dress,	and,	finally,	Fowler</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 I	 were	 holding	 the	 threads	 which,	 after	 encircling	 the	 psychic's	 wrists, </p>
<p class="calibre1">passed	under	the	chair-arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 yet,	 in	 spite	 of	 all	 these	 bonds	 and	 precautions,	 the	 cone	 was	 almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">immediately	 lifted,	 and	 "Mitchell"	 spoke	 through	 it.	 In	 a	 deep,	 clear,	 well-delivered,	 and	 decidedly	 masculine	 whisper,	 and	 with	 stately	 periods,	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">promised	 the	 complete	 co-operation	 of	 the	 spirit	 world	 in	 the	 great	 work	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	I	was	devoting	myself.	He	directed	his	exhortation	to	me,	as	usual;	and	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	benefit	of	those	who	think	the	spirits	are	always	trivial	or	foolish,	I	wish	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">say	that	"Mitchell's"	remarks	were	dignified	and	very	suggestive.	He	produced	in my	mind	the	distinct	impression	of	a	serious	man	of	seventy,	ornate	of	rhetoric, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 never	 vague	 or	 wandering	 in	 his	 thought,	 and	 he	 never	 went	 outside	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">circle	of	Mrs.	Smiley's	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	fully	a	quarter	of	an	hour	he	discussed	with	me	the	value	of	the	investigation</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	we	were	pursuing.	"  <i class="calibre4">I	and	my	band</i>,"	he	assured	me,	"  <i class="calibre4">are	working	as	hard</i> <i class="calibre4">from	our	side	as	you	are	from	yours,	equally	intent	upon	opening	up	channels	of</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a> <i class="calibre4">communication	 between	 the	 two	 worlds</i>."	 He	 solemnly	 urged	 me	 to	 proceed	 in this	"  <i class="calibre4">grand	work</i>,"	and	at	last	said,	"  <i class="calibre4">Good-bye	for	the	present</i>,"	and	fell	silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cone	was	then	deposited	on	the	table,	and	"Maud"	said:	"  <i class="calibre4">If	Mr.	Garland	and</i> <i class="calibre4">Mr.	Fowler	will	go	quietly	up	to	mama's	side,	holding	all	the	time	tightly	to	the</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">threads,	'Mr.	Mitchell'	will	do	what	Mr.	Garland	so	much	desires.	Please	be	very</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">careful	not	to	touch	mama	until	I	tell	you.	Keep	as	far	apart	as	you	can	as	you</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">go	 up	 to	 her.	 When	 you	 reach	 my	 mama's	 side,	 you	 may	 put	 one	 hand	 on	 her</i> <i class="calibre4">head	 and	 one	 on	 her	 wrist.	 'Mr.	 Mitchell'	 says	 please	 have	 Frank	 take	 Mrs. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Fowler's	hands,	so	that	every	hand	in	the	circle	is	accounted	for. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	now	very	eager	and	very	alert.	I	felt	that	at	last,	after	many,	many	requests</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 many	 trials,	 I	 was	 about	 to	 secure	 a	 clear,	 complete,	 and	 satisfying</p>
<p class="calibre1">demonstration.	 Surely	 no	 trickster	 would	 permit	 such	 rigorous	 control	 as	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">toward	 which	 we	 were	 now	 invited.	 I	 was	 sorry	 that	 Miller	 was	 not	 present	 to share	 with	 me	 the	 satisfaction	 of	 the	 moment.	 My	 admiration	 went	 out	 toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	heroic	little	woman,	who	was	enduring	so	much	pain	and	suspicion	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sake	of	science.	"She	believes	in	herself,"	I	thought.	"If	she	succeeds,	all	honor to	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowly	we	crept	to	her	side,	being	careful	to	touch	nothing	until	directed	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice	of	"Maud."	At	last	the	childish	voice	said:	"  <i class="calibre4">Mr.	Garland	may	put	his	right</i> <i class="calibre4">hand	 on	 top	 of	 mama's	 head	 and	 his	 left	 hand	 on	 her	 wrist.	 Mr.	 Fowler	 may</i> <i class="calibre4">place	his	left	hand	above	Mr.	Garland's	and	his	right	hand	on	mama's	wrist.	'Mr. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Mitchell'	says	he	will	then	see	if	the	voices	will	not	come. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 then	 said	 aloud:	 "My	 right	 hand	 is	 on	 the	 psychic's	 head,	 my	 left	 is	 on	 her wrist." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fowler	 repeated:	 "My	 left	 hand	 is	 above	 Garland's	 right,	 which	 is	 on	 the psychic's	head,	and	my	own	right	hand	is	on	the	right	wrist	of	the	psychic.	Now, </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Wilbur,'	go	ahead." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	 challenge	 was	 almost	 instantly	 caught	 up.	 While	 thus	 double-safeguarding</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	psychic,	the	cone,	which	was	resting	on	the	table	a	full	yard	away,	rose	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	sharp,	metallic,	scraping	sound,	and	remained	in	the	air	for	fully	half	a	minute, </p>
<p class="calibre1">during	 which	 I	 called	 out,	 sharply:	 "We	 are	 absolutely	 controlling	 the	 psychic; her	hands	are	motionless;	Mrs.	Fowler,	be	sure	you	are	holding	both	of	Frank's</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	have	both	his	hands	in	mine,"	she	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>As	 the	 cone	 was	 gently	 returned	 to	 the	 carpet	 Fowler	 was	 moved	 to	 say:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Garland,	 that	 was	 a	 supreme	 test	 of	 the	 psychic.	 She	 was	 absolutely	 not concerned	in	any	known	way	with	that	movement.	Save	for	a	curious	throbbing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">wave-like	motion	in	her	scalp,	she	did	not	move.	If	she	lifted	the	horn,	it	was	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	exercise	of	a	force	unrecognized	by	science." </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	this	I	was	forced	to	agree.	I	here	definitely	declare	that	the	psychic	was	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">concerned	 with	 the	 flight	 of	 the	 cone	 in	 any	 way	 known	 to	 biology.	 If	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1">produced	 the	 voices,	 they	 too	 must	 have	 been	 examples	 of	 supernormal</p>
<p class="calibre1">ventriloquism,	for	they	came	through	the	megaphone.	Of	that	I	am	as	certain	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	can	be	of	an	auditory	impression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 few	 moments	 later	 we	 returned	 to	 our	 seats,	 while	 "Wilbur"	 and	 "Mitchell" </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	several	other	voices	spoke	to	us.	Fowler,	now	that	I	had	admitted	telekinesis, </p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted	me	to	go	further.	"Is	the	psychic	speaking	to	us,"	he	asked,	"or	are	these voices	independent	of	her?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"An	investigator	is	never	satisfied,"	I	answered.	"I	must	have	the	voices	 <i class="calibre4">through</i> the	cone	while	I	am	covering	the	psychic's	mouth." </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	this	"Mitchell"	replied:	"  <i class="calibre4">We	are	doing	all	we	can,	and	we	will	yet	be	able	to</i> <i class="calibre4">meet	every	demand	you	make	upon	us. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	am	anxious	for	conviction,"	I	said.	"I	want	to	secure	the	voice	of	the	psychic and	your	voice	at	the	same	time,	'Mr.	Mitchell.'	Can	you	do	that	for	me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 seemed	 to	 hesitate,	 and	 at	 last	 said:	 "  <i class="calibre4">We	 will	 try. </i>"	 I	 perceived	 in	 his	 tone	 a certain	 doubt	 and	 indecision.	 Again	 we	 were	 permitted	 to	 hold	 the	 psychic's</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrists,	 and,	 as	 before,	 the	 cone	 was	 lifted	 and	 drummed	 upon	 as	 if	 to	 show	 its position	 high	 in	 the	 air;	 but	 no	 voices	 came.	 Hidden	 forces	 seemed	 to	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">struggling	for	escape	beneath	our	hands;	the	woman's	brain	seemed	a	powerful</p>
<p class="calibre1">dynamo.	I	could	not	rid	myself	of	a	sense	that	there	was	an	actual	externalization</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 psychic's	 nerve	 force,	 and	 with	 this	 conviction	 I	 could	 well	 understand why	the	command	had	so	often	been	given	not	to	touch	her	unbidden.	Suppose</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 poor	 naked	 "astral	 body"	 were	 abroad	 and	 a	 strong	 light	 were	 suddenly turned	upon	it! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	came	on	a	singularly	engrossing	game	of	"hide-and-seek."	Convinced	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Smiley	was	innocent	of	any	trick	in	the	movement	of	the	horn,	I	tried	every</p>
<p class="calibre1">expedient	 to	 satisfy	 myself	 that	 "Wilbur's"	 voice	 was	 independent	 of	 her	 own; but	I	did	not	succeed.	Mrs.	Smiley	spoke	 <i class="calibre4">almost</i>	at	the	same	moment	but	never</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a>precisely	 synchronous	 with	 Wilbur's	 whisper.	 She	 answered	 all	 my	 questions perfectly	unconcerned	and	unexcited,	lending	herself	to	my	experiments.	All	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">vain.	At	no	time	did	I	succeed	in	getting	"Wilbur's"	voice	at	 <i class="calibre4">precisely</i>	the	same moment	 with	 her	 own,	 though	 the	 whisper,	 following	 swiftly	 on	 her	 speech, </p>
<p class="calibre1">interjected	 remarks	 as	 if	 echoing	 her	 questions.	 There	 was	 always	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">approximate	interval	between	her	voice	and	the	spirit	whisper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	to	me	very	significant,	and	strengthened	me	in	my	belief	that	the	entire</p>
<p class="calibre1">process,	while	inexplicable,	was,	after	all,	not	the	work	of	spirits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 the	 gas	 was	 lighted	 we	 found	 the	 cone	 had	 been	 placed	 on	 the	 table,	 a distance	 of	 forty	 inches	 from	 the	 utmost	 reach	 of	 the	 psychic's	 hands.	 Her	 feet were	 twenty-three	 inches	 from	 the	 nearest	 leg	 of	 the	 table.	 We	 carefully</p>
<p class="calibre1">examined	 the	 tapes	 which	 were	 sewed	 to	 her	 sleeves.	 They	 were	 tied,	 and	 the doubled	 ends	 tacked	 precisely	 as	 described	 so	 many	 times,	 and	 to	 remove	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tacks	we	were	forced	to	use	a	hammer.	It	is	useless	to	talk	of	a	possible	release</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	her	arms	during	the	phenomena	of	the	cone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	was	about	to	leave	the	house	that	night,	Mrs.	Smiley	said:	"I	do	not	feel	able to	sit	any	more	for	the	present,	Mr.	Garland.	I	feel	myself	growing	weaker,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">'Mitchell'	 tells	 me	 I	 would	 better	 stop	 for	 the	 present.	 I	 feel	 that	 my	 power belongs	to	the	world,	and	I	want	to	do	all	I	can	to	convince	you	of	the	truth	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">spiritualism,	but	I	feel	the	strain	very	greatly." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	do	not	wonder	at	that,"	I	responded,	"and	I	cannot	blame	you	for	demanding	a rest.	No	one	could	have	endured	more	uncomplainingly.	You	have	been	a	model</p>
<p class="calibre1">subject,	 and	 we	 are	 deeply	 in	 your	 debt.	 I	 am	 sorry	 Miller	 was	 not	 with	 us	 to-night;	he	would	have	been	convinced	of	your	supernormal	power	at	least.	Have</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	 fear	 of	 my	 report;	 for	 while	 I	 am	 not	 convinced	 of	 the	 spirit	 hypothesis,	 I have	found	you	honest	and	patient	and	very	brave.	I	thank	you	very	sincerely	for</p>

<p class="calibre1">Cameron's	Amateur	Psychic	Club,	which	had	so	nearly	disintegrated	by	reason</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	long	series	of	barren	sittings,	was	drawn	together	again	by	the	news	of	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">startling	success	at	 Fowler's	house.	Cameron	 at	once	decided	 that	the	members</p>
<p class="calibre1">should	hear	my	report,	and	I	was	notified	to	be	ready	to	relate	my	experiences	in</p>

<p class="calibre1">possession	of	the	facts	the	coffee	and	cigars	had	appeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why	didn't	these	wonders	take	place	in	our	presence?"	asked	Mrs.	Quigg,	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 returned	 to	 something	 like	 her	 original	 truculence	 of	 doubt.	 "Why	 should you	and	Brierly	be	so	favored?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In	 this	 business	 everything	 comes	 to	 him	 who	 waits,"	 I	 replied,	 a	 tinge	 of malice	in	my	voice.	"You	obtained	a	few	results,	Miller	a	few	more;	but	Fowler</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 I,	 for	 our	 pains,	 reaped	 the	 rich	 reward.	 By	 remaining	 long	 on	 the	 watch-tower	 we	 saw	 the	 armies	 pass.	 Harmony	 and	 patience	 are	 essentials	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">production	 of	 these	 marvels.	 With	 people	 yawning	 or	 shuffling	 about	 uneasily, </p>
<p class="calibre1">results	are	necessarily	unimportant." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller	continued	firm	in	his	agnosticism.	"Although	puzzling,	I	cannot	grant	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	 as	 even	 one	 of	 the	 phenomena.	 Belief	 in	 the	 smallest	 of	 those</p>
<p class="calibre1">manifestations	 at	 my	 house	 would	 be	 uprooting	 to	 all	 established	 theories	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter—not	to	mention	time	and	space." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Were	not	the	notions	of	Galileo	and	Darwin	also	subverting?"	asked	Fowler.	"Is there	 anything	 sacred	 in	 error?	 If	 we	 are	 wrong	 in	 our	 theories	 about	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">universe,	let's	correct	them.	You	do	not	stand	out	against	wireless	telegraphy	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Röntgen	ray?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller	 fired	 at	 this.	 "I'm	 not	 going	 to	 take	 instruction	 from	 a	 tipping	 table	 or	 a flying	hair-brush!"	he	fiercely	retorted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	take	illumination	from	any	source	whatsoever,"	responded	Fowler. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here	I	interposed:	"The	only	question	that	concerns	me	at	this	stage	is:	Does	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">table	tip	and	the	brush	really	fly?	No	physical	fact	is	trivial,	for	it	stands	related</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>to	mountains	and	the	clouds." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fowler's	 eyes	 gleamed	 with	 contempt.	 "That's	 the	 way	 of	 you	 so-called</p>
<p class="calibre1">scientists:	you	narrow	the	mighty	fund	of	occult	phenomena	down	to	a	floating</p>
<p class="calibre1">feather.	 As	 a	 matter	 of	 fact,	 there	 is	 a	 sea	 of	 evidence	 accumulated	 by	 the investigations	of	men	quite	as	scientific	as	Miller,	testimony	that	is	neither	petty</p>
<p class="calibre1">nor	ignoble.	It	is	because	you	and	your	associates	are	so	trifling	in	methods	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	tables	and	the	chair	play	leading	parts	in	your	drama." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good	 for	 you!"	 cheered	 Brierly.	 "You're	 quite	 right.	 When	 these	 materialistic investigators	get	done	with	trying	to	prove	that	independent	slate-writing	exists, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they'll	 begin	 to	 give	 some	 attention	 to	 the	 fundamental	 truths	 of	 the	 messages which	 the	 slates	 set	 forth.	 Going	 after	 small	 things,	 they	 get	 small	 things.	 If Miller	and	his	like	went	forth	seeking	the	essentials	of	the	faith,	they	would	find</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	instead	of	being	amazed	with	foolish	tricks	of	hand." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Essentials	such	as	what?"	interrupted	Harris,	with	snappy	suddenness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Such	 as—as—direct	 spirit	 communication,	 a	 knowledge	 of	 the	 astral,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">reincarnation	 of	 souls,	 and—and—faith	 in	 the	 upward	 progression	 of	 the	 self," </p>
<p class="calibre1">stammered	Brierly,	much	disturbed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here	 again	 I	 interposed	 a	 quieting	 word:	 "I	 confess	 that	 it	 begins	 to	 look	 as though	the	theosophist's	theory	of	the	astral	(at	which	some	of	us	have	smiled)</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 in	 a	 fair	 way	 to	 be	 scientifically	 demonstrated.	 Since	 our	 last	 meeting	 I have	been	studying	the	bound	volumes	of	 <i class="calibre4">The	Annals	of	Psychic	Science</i>,	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	found	them	full	of	comfort.	They	sustain	Mrs.	Smiley	at	every	point.	To	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind,	 the	 most	 important	 event	 in	 the	 history	 of	 spiritism	 is	 the	 entrance	 of Eusapia	Paladino	into	the	clinical	laboratory	of	Cesare	Lombroso.	Nothing	since</p>
<p class="calibre1">Crookes's	experiments	has	had	such	value	for	the	scientist." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	have	heard	of	Lombroso,	but	who	is	Paladino?"	asked	Mrs.	Quigg.	"Is	she	a psychic?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	is	the	most	renowned	now	living.	Though	only	an	illiterate	peasant	woman, </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 has	 been	 able	 for	 more	 than	 twenty	 years	 to	 baffle	 every	 scientist	 who	 has studied	her.	Her	organism	remains	the	most	potent	mystery	on	this	earth." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tell	us	about	her!	Who	is	she?	Where	does	she	live?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	 was	 born	 at	 Minerva-murge,	 a	 mountain	 village	 near	 Bari,	 in	 Italy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">According	to	Lombroso's	daughter,	who	has	written	a	sketch	of	her,	she	is	about</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>fifty-three	years	of	age.	Her	parents	were	peasants.	She	is	quite	uneducated,	but is	intelligent	and	rather	good-looking.	Her	hands	are	pretty	and	her	feet	small—</p>
<p class="calibre1">facts	which	are	of	value	when	studying	her	manifestations,	as	you	will	see	later</p>
<p class="calibre1">on.	Her	mother	died	while	Eusapia	was	a	babe,	and	her	father	'passed	over'	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 was	 twelve,	 leaving	 her	 at	 large	 in	 the	 world	 'like	 a	 wild	 animal,'	 as	 she herself	says.	A	native	family	of	her	village	took	her	to	Naples,	and	her	own	story</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	that	she	was	adopted	soon	after	by	some	foreigners	'who	wished	to	make	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	educated	and	learned	girl.	They	wanted	me	to	take	a	bath	every	day	and	comb</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	hair	every	day,'	she	explains,	with	some	humor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	 didn't	 like	 the	 life	 nor	 the	 people,	 and	 she	 soon	 ran	 away	 back	 to	 her friends,	the	Apulians,	and	it	was	while	she	was	in	their	house	and	at	the	precise</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment	when	they	were	planning	to	put	her	in	a	convent	that	her	occult	powers</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	discovered.	Some	friends	came	in	to	spend	the	evening,	and,	in	default	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything	better	to	do,	formed	a	circle	to	make	a	table	tip.	No	sooner	were	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	seated,	as	she	herself	relates,	than	'the	table	began	to	rise,	the	chairs	to	dance, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 curtains	 to	 swell,	 and	 the	 glasses	 and	 bottles	 to	 walk	 about,	 till	 everybody was	 scared.'	 After	 testing	 every	 other	 person	 present,	 the	 host	 came	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">conclusion	that	the	medium	was	his	little	ward,	Eusapia.	This	put	an	end	to	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">going	 into	 a	 convent.	 She	 was	 proclaimed	 a	 medium,	 much	 to	 her	 disgust,	 and made	to	sit	whole	evenings	at	the	table.	'I	only	did	it,'	she	says,	'because	it	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	 of	 recompensing	 my	 hosts,	 whose	 desire	 to	 keep	 me	 with	 them	 prevented</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	placing	me	in	a	convent.	Finally	I	took	up	laundress	work,	thinking	I	might</p>
<p class="calibre1">render	 myself	 independent	 and	 live	 as	 I	 liked	 without	 troubling	 about</p>
<p class="calibre1">spiritualistic	séances.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	 is	 remarkable	 how	 many	 of	 these	 women	 psychics	 begin	 their	 career	 when they	are	ten	or	twelve	years	old,"	said	Miller.	"Mrs.	Smiley	was	about	that	age, wasn't	she?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	and	so	was	Mrs.	Hartley,	another	psychic	of	my	acquaintance.	Mrs.	Smiley</p>
<p class="calibre1">complained	 of	 the	 tedium	 of	 sitting.	 She	 tells	 me	 that	 her	 father	 kept	 her	 at	 it steadily,	 just	 as	 Eusapia	 was	 not	 permitted	 to	 escape	 her	 fate.	 One	 day	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">Englishwoman,	 wife	 of	 a	 certain	 Mr.	 Damiani,	 came	 to	 a	 séance,	 and	 was	 so</p>
<p class="calibre1">impressed	 by	 what	 took	 place	 that	 she	 interested	 her	 husband	 in	 Eusapia's</p>
<p class="calibre1">performances.	Damiani	then	took	up	the	young	medium's	development	along	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">good	 old	 well-worn	 lines	 of	 American	 spiritualism,	 and	 she	 acquired	 all	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tricks	 and	 all	 the	 'patter.'	 Among	 other	 notions,	 she	 picked	 up	 the	 idea	 of	 an English	'control'	known	as	'John	King,'	who	declared	himself	a	brother	of	'Kate</p>
<p class="calibre1">King,'	 of	 Crookes	 fame,	 and	 from	 that	 day	 Eusapia	 has	 been	 a	 professional</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>'mejum.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	does	she	do?"	asked	Cameron.	"What	is	her	'phase,'	as	you	call	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	must	be	confessed	that	most	of	her	phases	are	of	the	poltergeist	variety,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 are	 astounding.	 She	 produces	 the	 movement	 of	 mandolins,	 chairs,	 sofas, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 small	 tables	 without	 contact	 (at	 least,	 such	 is	 the	 consensus	 of	 opinion	 of nearly	 a	 score	 of	 the	 best-known	 scientists	 of	 France	 and	 Italy),	 and	 also</p>
<p class="calibre1">materializes	hands	and	arms.	There	is	vastly	more	than	the	poltergeist	in	her,	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 evident;	 for	 she	 has	 conquered	 every	 critic	 with	 her	 miracles.	 Take,	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1">instance,	Lombroso's	conversion,	a	fairly	typical	case.	He	was	not	only	sceptical</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 spirit	 phenomena,	 but	 up	 to	 1888	 was	 openly	 contemptuous	 of	 those	 who</p>
<p class="calibre1">believed	 in	 them.	 However,	 in	 an	 article	 called	 'The	 Influence	 of	 Civilization upon	Genius,'	published	in	1888,	he	made	this	admission:	'  <i class="calibre4">Twenty	or	thirty	years</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">are	 enough	 to	 make	 the	 whole	 world	 admire	 a	 discovery	 which	 was	 treated	 as</i> <i class="calibre4">madness	at	the	moment	when	it	was	made....	Who	knows	whether	my	friends	and</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I	who	laugh	at	spiritualism	are	not	in	error,	just	like	hypnotized	persons,	or	like</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">lunatics;	being	in	the	dark	as	regards	the	truth,	we	laugh	at	those	who	are	not	in</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">the	same	condition. </i>'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"True	 enough,"	 said	 Fowler.	 "The	 man	 who	 has	 made	 no	 study	 of	 these phenomena	is	like	one	color-blind:	he	has	never	seen	a	landscape." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	was	this	candid	statement	by	Lombroso	that	moved	Professor	Chiaia,	a	friend</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	Eusapia's,	to	write	the	great	alienist	a	letter	which	was	in	effect	a	challenge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	recounting	a	score	or	two	of	the	wonderful	doings	of	Paladino,	whom	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 studied	 carefully,	 he	 ended	 in	 this	 amusing	 fashion:	 'Now	 you	 see	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">challenge.	If	you	have	not	written	the	paragraph	cited	above	simply	for	the	fun</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	writing	it,	if	you	have	the	true	love	for	science,	if	you	are	without	prejudices</p>
<p class="calibre1">—you,	 the	 first	 alienist	 of	 Italy—please	 take	 the	 field.	 When	 you	 can	 afford	 a week's	vacation,	indicate	a	place	where	we	can	meet.	Four	gentlemen	will	be	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">seconds:	you	will	choose	two,	and	I	will	bring	the	other	two....	If	the	experiment</p>
<p class="calibre1">does	 not	 succeed,	 you	 will	 consider	 me	 but	 as	 a	 man	 suffering	 from</p>
<p class="calibre1">hallucination,	 who	 longs	 to	 be	 cured	 of	 his	 extravagances....	 If	 success	 crowns our	efforts,	your	loyalty	...	will	attest	the	reality	of	these	mysterious	phenomena</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	promise	to	investigate	their	causes.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 hope	 Lombroso	 was	 man	 enough	 to	 accept	 the	 challenge,"	 said	 Cameron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothing	could	be	fairer	than	the	spook-man's	offer." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	did	not	at	once	take	up	the	gage.	It	was	not,	in	fact,	till	February,	1891,	that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a>he	was	able	to	go	to	Naples	to	meet	Eusapia,	who	had	begun	to	interest	some	of his	 trusted	 scientific	 friends.	 He	 found	 the	 great	 psychic	 quite	 normal	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">appearance	 and	 rather	 attractive	 in	 manner.	 She	 was	 of	 medium	 size,	 with	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">broad	and	rather	serious	face	lit	with	brilliant	dark	eyes.	The	most	notable	thing</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	 her	 physical	 self	 was	 a	 depression	 in	 her	 skull	 caused	 by	 a	 fall	 in	 her infancy.	This	scar	figures	largely	in	nearly	all	the	reports	of	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why?"	asked	Harris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Because	they	all	agree	that	a	singular	sort	of	current	of	force,	like	a	cool	breeze, seems	to	come	and	go	through	this	spot." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harris	groaned,	and	Howard	said:	"Oh,	rubbish!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Rubbish	or	not,	they	all	speak	of	this	scar	and	its	singular	effects.	At	the	time</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	 Lombroso	 saw	 her	 first,	 Eusapia	 was	 just	 beginning	 to	 be	 known	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">scientists,	 but	 no	 one	 of	 special	 note	 had	 up	 to	 this	 time	 (1891)	 reported	 upon her.	She	was	known	as	the	wife	of	a	small	shop-keeper	in	Naples,	and	seemed	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">decent,	 matronly	 person,	 quite	 untouched	 by	 mysticism.	 Although	 not	 eager	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">sit	for	Lombroso	and	his	party	of	scientists,	she	finally	consented.	Among	those</p>
<p class="calibre1">who	 took	 part	 in	 these	 celebrated	 experiments	 were	 Professor	 Tamburini,	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">eminent	scientist;	Dr.	Bianchi,	the	superintendent	of	the	Insane	Asylum	of	Sales; </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 Dr.	 Penta,	 a	 young	 nephew	 of	 Lombroso,	 a	 resident	 of	 Naples.	 Lombroso</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	charge	of	the	sittings,	which	were	held	in	a	room	of	his	own	choice	and	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	medium	entirely	under	his	control.	He	was	astonished	at	the	prompt	response</p>
<p class="calibre1">obtained.	At	the	first	sitting,	while	he	and	Professor	Tamburini	held	the	psychic's</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands,	a	bell	was	carried	tinkling	through	the	air	and	a	small	table	moved	as	if	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	alive.	Many	other	mysterious	movements	took	place.	Lombroso	was	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	 disturbed	 by	 these	 inexplicable	 phenomena,	 and	 could	 not	 rest	 till	 he	 sat again.	 At	 the	 second	 séance	 spectral	 hands	 developed,	 profoundly	 mystifying</p>
<p class="calibre1">every	 sitter,	 and	 Lombroso	 went	 away,	 promising	 to	 carry	 forward	 a	 study	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">spiritism.	In	a	letter	written	the	following	June	he	manfully	said:	'  <i class="calibre4">I	am	filled	with</i> <i class="calibre4">confusion,	and	regret	that	I	combated	with	so	much	persistence	the	possibilities</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">of	the	facts	called	spiritualistic.	I	say	facts,	for	I	am	opposed	to	the	theory. </i>'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did	Lombroso	say	that?"	asked	Harris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	 wrote	 it,	 which	 is	 still	 more	 to	 the	 point,	 and	 it	 was	 his	 acceptance	 of	 the main	 <i class="calibre4">facts</i>	of	Paladino's	mediumship	that	led	other	groups	of	scientists	to	take	up her	 case.	 Professor	 Schiaparelli,	 Director	 of	 the	 Observatory	 at	 Milan;	 Gerosa, Professor	 of	 Physics;	 Ermacora,	 Doctor	 of	 Natural	 Philosophy;	 Aksakof, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a>Councilor	 of	 State	 to	 the	 Emperor	 of	 Russia;	 and	 Charles	 du	 Prel,	 Doctor	 of Philosophy	in	Munich,	were	in	the	next	group,	which	met	at	Milan	with	intent	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">settle	the	claims	of	this	bold	charlatan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	sittings	took	place	in	the	apartment	of	Monsieur	Finzi	at	Milan,	and	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	rigid	and	searching	than	any	Paladino	had	ever	passed	through,	but	she	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">again	 triumphant.	 She	 bewildered	 them	 all.	 Lombroso	 himself	 was	 present</p>
<p class="calibre1">during	 some	 of	 the	 sittings.	 The	 results	 of	 the	 series	 of	 experiments	 were	 very notable	 and	 very	 far-reaching.	 For	 the	 first	 time,	 so	 far	 as	 I	 know,	 a	 table	 was photographed	while	floating	in	the	air—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No!"	shouted	Howard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes;	 and	 certain	 other	 telekinetic	 happenings	 were	 proved,	 to	 the	 stupefaction of	 most	 of	 those	 in	 the	 group.	 One	 special	 experiment,	 the	 success	 of	 which confounded	 the	 shrewdest,	 was	 the	 attempt	 to	 secure	 on	 a	 smoke-blackened</p>
<p class="calibre1">paper	the	print	of	one	of	the	spectral	hands." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did	it	succeed?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes.	The	impression	was	made	while	Paladino's	hands	were	imprisoned	beyond</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	 question,	 and,	 what	 was	 most	 singular	 of	 all,	 the	 hand	  <i class="calibre4">that	 made	 the	 print</i> <i class="calibre4">smudged	the	wrists	of	one	of	the	experimenters,	and	yet	not	a	particle	of	black</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">appeared	on	the	fingers	of	the	psychic</i>." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	 ought	 to	 have	 convinced	 them	 of	 her	 honesty,"	 remarked	 Fowler,	 with	 a note	 of	 amusement	 in	 his	 voice,	 "but	 it	 didn't;	 these	 scientific	 folk	 are	 so difficult." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	 I	 replied,	 "it	 didn't	 convince	 them,	 but	 it	 jarred	 them	 not	 a	 little.	 In	 their report	they	admitted	this	much.	They	said,	'We	do	not	believe	we	have	the	right</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	explain	these	things	by	the	aid	of	insulting	assumptions.'	(By	this	they	meant</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	acquit	the	psychic	of	fraud.)	'We	think,	on	the	contrary,	that	 <i class="calibre4">these	experiments</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">have	 to	 do	 with	 phenomena	 of	 an	 unknown	 nature</i>,	 and	 we	 confess	 that	 we	 do not	know	what	the	conditions	are	that	are	required	to	produce	them.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	seems	to	me	like	a	very	mild	statement,	but	I	suppose	they	considered	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">epoch-making,"	remarked	Fowler. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"From	 this	 time	 forward	 learned	 men	 in	 Russia,	 France,	 and	 Italy	 successively sought	 Paladino	 out	 and	 tried	 to	 expose	 her	 to	 the	 world.	 Professor	 Wagner,	 of the	Department	of	Zoölogy	at	the	University	of	St.	Petersburg,	made	a	study	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a>her	 in	 1893,	 and	 found	 her	 powers	 real.	 A	 year	 later	 M.	 Siemeradski, correspondent	of	the	Institute,	experimented	with	her	in	Rome,	obtaining,	among</p>
<p class="calibre1">other	 miracles,	 the	 plucking	 of	 the	 strings	 of	 a	 closed	 piano	 under	 strictly	 test conditions." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	had	that	experience,	did	you	not?"	asked	Mrs.	Cameron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	I've	had	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	do	you	account	for	a	thing	of	that	sort?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	account	for	it—or	if	I	did	give	my	theory,	you	would	laugh	at	me.	Wait</p>
<p class="calibre1">till	 I	 tell	 you	 what	 these	 Italians	 are	 doing.	 Among	 the	 most	 eminent	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">persuasive	 of	 all	 Eusapia's	 investigators	 was	 Professor	 Charles	 Richet,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">French	physiologist	and	author.	Eusapia	came	to	revere	and	trust	him,	and	gave</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	many	sittings.	He,	too,	was	bowled	over.	He	tells	the	story	of	his	conversion</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	charmingly.	'In	my	servile	respect	for	classic	tradition,'	he	writes,	'I	laughed</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	Crookes	and	his	experiments;	but	it	must	be	remembered	in	my	excuse	that	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 professional	 physiologist	 I	 moved	 habitually	 along	 a	 road	 quite	 other	 than</p>
<p class="calibre1">mystical.'	His	attention,	he	goes	on	to	say,	was	first	drawn	to	spiritist	phenomena</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	the	word	of	a	friend	who	had	discovered	a	power	that	caused	a	table	to	move</p>
<p class="calibre1">intelligently.	He	was	trying	to	explain	this	and	one	or	two	other	little	things	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">telepathy	 and	 prophetic	 vision	 by	 the	 word	 'somnambulism,'	 when	 his	 friend</p>
<p class="calibre1">Aksakof,	 a	 great	 psychical	 expert,	 reproached	 him	 for	 not	 interesting	 himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	keenly	in	experiments	with	mediums.	'Well,'	said	Richet,	'if	I	were	sure	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 single	 true	 medium	 existed,	 I	 would	 willingly	 go	 to	 the	 ends	 of	 the	 world	 to meet	him.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	the	spirit!"	exclaimed	Fowler.	"That	is	the	way	the	scientist	should	feel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	 then?	 Aksakof	 told	 him	 all	 he	 needed	 to	 do	 was	 to	 go	 round	 the	 corner, didn't	he?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	 exactly.	 Two	 years	 later	 Aksakof	 wrote	 to	 him:	 'You	 needn't	 come	 to	 the end	of	the	world;	Milan	will	do.'	So	Richet	went	to	Milan,	and	took	part	in	those</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	 celebrated	 séances	 with	 Eusapia.	 'When	 I	 left	 Milan,'	 Richet	 says,	 'I	 was convinced	that	all	was	true;	but	no	sooner	was	I	back	in	my	accustomed	channels</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	work	than	my	doubts	returned.	I	persuaded	myself	that	all	had	been	fraud	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">illusion.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here	Harris	interrupted:	"Miller	can	testify	to	this	inability	to	retain	a	conviction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He,	too,	has	slumped	into	doubt.	How	about	it,	Miller?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a>"I	never	professed	to	believe,"	declared	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	were	pretty	well	convinced	that	night	in	your	study,	weren't	you?"	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	was	puzzled,"	he	replied,	guardedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	general	smile	of	amusement	at	his	manifest	evasion,	and	I	resumed:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Richet	 went	 to	 Rome,	 and	 together	 with	 Schrenk-Nötzing,	 the	 philosophic</p>
<p class="calibre1">expert,	 and	 Siemeradski,	 the	 correspondent	 of	 the	 French	 Institute,	 made	 other and	 still	 more	 convincing	 experiments,	 and	 yet	 doubt	 persisted!	 'I	 was	 not	 yet satisfied,'	he	says,	further.	'  <i class="calibre4">I	invited	Eusapia	to	my	house	for	three	months.	Alone</i> <i class="calibre4">with	 her	 and	 Ochorowicz,	 a	 man	 of	 penetrating</i>	  <i class="calibre4">perspicuity,	 I	 renewed	 my</i> <i class="calibre4">experiments	 in	 the	 best	 possible	 conditions	 of	 solitude	 and	 quiet	 reflection.	 We</i> <i class="calibre4">thus	acquired	a	positive	proof	of	the	reality	of	the	facts	announced	at	Milan. </i>'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"By	George,	that's	going	it	strong!"	said	young	Howard.	"You've	got	to	believe that	a	man	like	Richet	has	seen	something	after	three	months'	experiment	in	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">own	house." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller	 faced	 them	 all	 stubbornly:	 "And	 yet	 even	 Richet	 may	 have	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">deceived." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are	 <i class="calibre4">you</i>	the	only	one	competent	to	study	these	facts?"	asked	Brierly,	hotly.	"The egotism	of	you	professional	physicists	is	a	kind	of	insanity.	The	moment	a	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	 Richet	 or	 Lombroso	 admits	 a	 knowledge	 of	 one	 of	 these	 occult	 facts,	 you who	 have	 no	 experience	 in	 the	 same	 phenomena	 jump	 on	 him	 like	 so	 many</p>
<p class="calibre1">wolves.	Such	bigotry	is	unworthy	a	scientist." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Would	you	have	us	accept	the	word	of	any	one	man	when	that	word	contradicts</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	experience	of	all	mankind?"	asked	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Listen	 to	 what	 Richet	 says	 in	 confession	 of	  <i class="calibre4">his</i>	 perplexity,"	 I	 called	 out, soothingly.	 "He	 writes:	 'It	 took	 me	 twenty	 years	 to	 arrive	 at	 my	 present conviction—nay!	 to	 make	 one	 last	 confession.  <i class="calibre4">I	 am	 not	 yet	 absolutely	 and</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">irremediably	 convinced. </i>	 In	 spite	 of	 the	 astounding	 phenomena	 which	 I	 have witnessed	 during	 my	 sixty	 experiments	 with	 Eusapia,	 I	 have	 still	 a	 trace	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">doubt.  <i class="calibre4">Certainty	does	not	follow	on	demonstration;	it	follows	on	habit. </i>'	So	don't blame	 Miller	 or	 myself	 for	 inability	 to	 believe	 in	 these	 theories,	 for	 our	 minds are	the	kind	that	accept	the	mystical	with	sore	struggle." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Go	 on	 with	 Eusapia's	 career,"	 said	 Harris.	 "I	 am	 interested	 in	 her.	 I	 want	 the story	of	the	investigations." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>"Her	 story	 broadens,"	 I	 resumed.	 "Her	 fame	 spread	 throughout	 Europe,	 and squad	after	squad	of	militant	scientists	grappled	with	her,	each	one	perfectly	sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	he	was	the	one	to	unmask	her	to	the	world.	She	was	called	before	kings	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">emperors,	and	everywhere	she	triumphed—save	in	Cambridge,	where	she	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	partial	failure;	but	she	redeemed	herself	later	with	both	Lodge	and	Myers,	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	it	remains	true	to	say	that	she	has	gone	surely	from	one	success	to	another</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	greater	triumph." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	 there	 have	 been	 other	 such	 careers—Slade's	 and	 Home's,	 for	 instance—</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	ended	in	disaster." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"True,	but	nothing	like	her	courage	has	ever	been	known.	The	crowning	wonder</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 her	 career	 came	 when	 she	 consented	 to	 enter	 the	 special	 laboratories	 of	 the universities	of	Genoa	and	Naples.	It	is	in	the	writings	of	Morselli,	Professor	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Psychology	at	Genoa,	and	in	the	reports	of	Bottazzi,	head	of	the	Department	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Physics	at	Naples,	that	scepticism,	such	as	my	own,	is	met	and	conquered.	I	defy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller	 or	 any	 man	 of	 open	 mind	 to	 read	 the	 detailed	 story	 of	 these	 marvellous experiments	 and	 deny	 the	 existence	 of	 the	 basic	 phenomena	 produced	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eusapia	Paladino." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	speak	with	warmth,"	said	Harris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	do.	I	am	at	this	moment	fresh	from	a	reading	of	the	reports	of	Bottazzi's	up-to-</p>
<p class="calibre1">date	 experiments,	 and	 I	 am	 compelled	 to	 grant	 that	 he	 has	 not	 only	 sustained Crookes	 at	 every	 point,	 but	 has	 gone	 beyond	 him	 in	 his	 ingenuity	 of	 test	 and thoroughness	 of	 control.	 He	 adds	 the	 touch	 of	 certainty	 that	 we	 all	 needed	 to complete	 our	 own	 experience.	 He	 has	 given	 me	 courage	 to	 say	 what	 I	 believe</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Smiley	did	for	us." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Won't	you	tell	us	all	about	it?"	pleaded	Mrs.	Cameron.	"Please	do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	is	too	long	and	complicated.	You	must	read	it	for	yourself.	It	is	too	incredible to	be	told." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Never	mind,	Garland;	we'll	take	it	as	part	of	your	fiction.	Go	ahead." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 I	 looked	 about	 me,	 I	 could	 detect	 in	 the	 faces	 of	 some	 of	 my	 friends	 an expression	 of	 apprehension.	 The	 coffee	 had	 grown	 cold.	 Our	 ice-cream	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">melted	with	neglect.	Every	eye	was	fixed	upon	me.	It	was	plain	that	Harris	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller	considered	me	"on	the	high-road	to	spiritualism."	Quite	willing	to	gratify their	wish	to	be	startled,	I	proceeded:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a>"You	will	find	the	latest	word	on	all	these	matters	in	a	small	but	valuable	review, published	simultaneously	in	London	and	in	Paris,	called	 <i class="calibre4">The	 Annals	 of	 Psychic</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Science</i>.	 It	 is	 edited	 by	 César	 de	 Vesme	 in	 France,	 and	 by	 Laura	 I.	 Finch	 in England,	 and	 is	 a	 mine	 of	 reliable	 psychic	 science.	 Its	 directors	 are	 Dr.	 Dariex and	Professor	Charles	Richet.	Its	'committee'	is	made	up	of	Sir	William	Crookes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Camille	Flammarion,	Professor	Lombroso,	Marcel	Mangin,	Dr.	Joseph	Maxwell, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor	Enrico	Morselli,	of	Genoa;	Dr.	Julien	Ochorowicz,	head	of	the	General</p>
<p class="calibre1">Psychologic	 Institute	 of	 Paris;	 Professor	 Porro,	 the	 astronomer;	 Colonel	 Albert de	 Rochas,	 author	 of	  <i class="calibre4">The	 Externalization	 of	 Motivity</i>,	 and	 others	 of	 like character." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	don't	want	the	review,	we	want	your	account,"	said	Harris.	"Don't	spare	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Give	us	detail—lots	of	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank	 you;	 you	 shall	 have	 it	 hot-shot,	 but	 I'll	 have	 to	 generalize	 the	 story	 for you.	The	most	decisive	of	all	the	tests	have	been	made	during	the	last	eighteen</p>
<p class="calibre1">months,	 and	 the	 final	 and	 most	 convincing	 of	 all	 within	 the	 year,	 under	 the direction	 of	 Lombroso,	 Morselli,	 and	 Bottazzi.	 It	 is	 safe	 to	 say	 that	 with	 these experiments	(and	the	reports	which	accompany	them)	a	new	era	has	dawned	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">biology.	The	facts	of	mediumship	are	in	process	of	being	scientifically	observed</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	a	score	of	the	best-qualified	men	in	Europe,	and	at	last	we	are	about	to	study</p>
<p class="calibre1">mediumship	apart	from	any	question	of	religious	tenets." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fowler	 took	 issue	 with	 me	 here:	 "It	 is	 absurd	 to	 say	 that	 no	 one	 but	 these physicists	 has	 ever	 properly	 studied	 spiritualistic	 phenomena;	 spiritists</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves	have	put	the	screws	on	quite	as	effectively	as	ever	Crookes	or	Richet</p>
<p class="calibre1">has	done.	Some	of	the	best	investigators	ever	known	have	been	spiritists." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even	 if	 that	 were	 true,	 their	 testimony	 would	 lack	 the	 convincing	 power	 that flames	from	Morselli's	book	or	Bottazzi's	report.	The	essential	weakness	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">spiritist's	testimony	lies	in	the	fact	that	for	the	most	part	he	assumes	that	the	facts</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 mediumship	 are	 somehow,	 and	 necessarily,	 in	 opposition	 to	 somebody's</p>
<p class="calibre1">religion.	He	finds	it	sustained	(or	opposed)	by	the	Bible,	or	he	fancies	it	mixed</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 deviltry	 or	 the	 black	 art.	 He	 trembles	 for	 fear	 it	 will	 affect	 the	 scheme	 of redemption	or	assist	some	theosophical	system.	Whereas,	a	man	like	Bottazzi	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">engaged	merely	with	the	facts;	he	lets	the	inferences	fall	where	they	may.	He	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	concerned	with	whether	Eusapia's	manifestations	oppose	Christian	theology</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	 not;	 he	 wants	 the	 phenomena.	 He	 is	 alert	 to	 note	 their	 effect	 on	 biologic science,	 but	 he	 does	 not	 shrink	 from	 any	 report	 of	 them.	 So	 far	 as	 I	 am</p>
<p class="calibre1">concerned,	my	lot	is	cast	with	these	men	who	put	the	clamps	on	the	fact	and	wait</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a>for	 larger	 knowledge	 before	 constructing	 a	 system	 of	 religion	 on	 the	 half-discovered." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	with	you	there,"	said	Miller.	"And	if	our	university	officials	took	the	same view,	we	Americans	would	hold	higher	rank	in	the	world's	thought." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bottazzi	 himself	 says,	 with	 reference	 to	 his	 experiments:	 'In	 spite	 of	 all	 the hundreds	of	those	who	have	observed	Eusapia,	it	still	remained	true	to	say	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">hitherto	she	had	been	free	to	throw	things	about	as	she	pleased.'	But	all	this	took</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	sharp	turn	when	she	came	into	Bottazzi's	laboratory." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just	who	is	Bottazzi?"	Harris	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	the	head	of	the	Physiological	Institute	of	the	University	of	Naples;	of	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">age	and	general	character	I	am	not	precisely	informed,	but	he	writes	delightfully</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 his	 experiments.	 Morselli,	 who	 preceded	 him	 in	 his	 study	 of	 Eusapia,	 is	 the Professor	of	Psychology	in	the	University	of	Genoa.	Foà	and	Herlitzka	are	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same	 university.	 Within	 the	 last	 two	 years	 Eusapia	 has	 also	 been	 rigorously</p>
<p class="calibre1">studied	in	Lombroso's	clinical	laboratory	at	Turin.	All	honor	to	her	for	breaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">away	from	the	traditions	of	mediumship!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	 Quigg	 caught	 me	 up	 on	 this:	 "What	 do	 you	 mean	 by	 'traditions	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">mediumship'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 mean	 that	 for	 the	 most	 part	 investigators	 have	 nearly	 always	 been	 kept	 at arm's-length	 by	 the	 fiction	 that	 the	 'guide'	 should	 control	 everything,	 that	 the séance	 is	 a	 religious	 rite,	 that	 the	 medium	 must	 not	 be	 touched	 nor	 exposed	 to the	 light,	 and	 so	 on,	 till	 the	 scientist	 was	 reduced	 to	 the	 feeble	 rank	 of	 an	 on-looker	in	the	dark,	so	that	no	real	test	was	possible.	These	Italians	did	not	grant</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	of	these	traditions.	They	were	scientists,	not	devotees	at	a	new	shrine." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"However,	I	am	ready	to	grant	that	some	of	the	good	old	rules	were	justified.	As</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	 have	 seen	 in	 my	 own	 experiments,	 I	 have	 proceeded	 cautiously,	 for	 if	 you suppose	mediumship	to	be	a	psycho-dynamic	adjustment	of	the	organisms	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">circle—a	subtle	physical	relationship—there	is	all	the	more	reason	to	be	careful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 did	 not	 find	 it	 necessary	 to	 mistreat	 Mrs.	 Smiley	 in	 order	 to	 test	 her	 powers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 <i class="calibre4">Eusapia	 has	 set	 a	 new	 pace	 for	 mediums</i>.	 She	 has	 gone	 into	 the	 lion's	 den alone	 and	 unarmed—not	 once,	 but	 a	 hundred	 times.	 She	 entered	 Lombroso's</p>
<p class="calibre1">study,	 a	 room	 previously	 unexplored	 by	 her,	 and	 there	 placed	 herself	 before	 a cabinet	 that	 she	 was	 not	 permitted	 to	 examine—a	 cabinet	 filled	 with	 machines</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	dividing	the	true	from	the	false.	In	Morselli's	presence	she	submitted	to	tests</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a>the	like	of	which	not	even	Crookes	was	permitted	to	apply,	and	all	sacred	rules and	regulations,	all	ideas	of	religion	or	questions	of	morality,	vanished	when	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">entered	the	cold,	clear	air	of	Bottazzi's	physiological	laboratory." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This	 begins	 to	 sound	 like	 the	 grapple	 of	 a	 cuttlefish	 and	 a	 mermaid.	 Was	 the woman	crushed?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No;	 she	 more	 than	 sustained	 her	 great	 reputation.	 She	 conquered	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">remorseless	scientist	and	performed	the	impossible." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	the	strained	attention	of	my	audience	now.	Time	was	forgotten,	and	cries	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tell	us!"	"Tell	us	all!"	arose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	is	an	exciting	story,	an	incredible	story—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	much	the	better!"	exclaimed	Miss	Brush. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 am	 full	 of	 enthusiasm	 for	 Bottazzi,"	 I	 resumed.	 "His	 was	 the	 kind	 of investigation	 I	 should	 like	 to	 put	 through	 myself.	 It	 appeals	 to	 me	 as	 no</p>
<p class="calibre1">spiritualistic	performance	has	ever	done.	In	a	sense	the	facts	he	has	demonstrated</p>
<p class="calibre1">make	 all	 material	 tests	 inoperative.	 Matter	 is	 all	 we	 have	 to	 cling	 to	 when	 it comes	to	physical	tests.	A	nail	driven	down	through	the	sleeve	of	the	medium's</p>
<p class="calibre1">dress	  <i class="calibre4">seems</i>	 to	 increase	 our	 control	 of	 her,	 and	 a	 metronome	 or	 a	 Morse telegraphic	 sounder	 does	 add	 value	 to	 our	 testimony,	 and	 yet	 Zöllner	 seems</p>
<p class="calibre1">nearer	right	than	Miller:	matter	seems	only	a	condition	of	force,	and	subject	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">change	at	the	will	of	the	psychic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Up	 to	 the	 beginning	 of	 last	 year	 Bottazzi	 confesses	 that	 he	 had	 read	 little	 or nothing	on	the	subject,	and,	like	our	friend	Miller	here,	considered	it	beneath	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dignity	of	a	scientist	to	be	present	at	spiritualist	circles.	It	is	highly	instructive	to note	that	Paladino,	the	most	renowned	medium	of	her	time,	was	in	Naples	at	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	door;	but	that	doesn't	matter—a	scientist	is	blind	to	what	he	does	not	wish</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 see.	 In	 this	 case	 Bottazzi's	 eyes	 were	 opened	 by	 a	 young	 friend,	 Professor Charles	Foà,	of	Turin,	who	sent	him	an	account	of	what	he	and	Dr.	Herlitzka	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">witnessed	in	Eusapia's	presence." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	really	seem	to	be	taking	the	phenomena	seriously	over	there,"	said	Harris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"These	 particular	 sittings	 at	 Turin	 made	 a	 great	 sensation	 in	 Italy.	 They	 were under	the	direction	of	Drs.	Herlitzka,	Foà,	and	Aggazzotti,	assistants	to	Professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mosso,	 of	 the	 University	 of	 Turin.	 Dr.	 Pio	 Foà,	 Professor	 of	 Pathologic</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anatomy,	 was	 also	 present	 during	 one	 séance.	 The	 conditions	 were	 all	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>experimenters'	own	contriving.	They	were	young	men	and	had	been	companion workers	 in	 science	 for	 many	 years,	 and	 were	 accustomed	 to	 laboratory	 work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	all	came	to	this	experiment	perfectly	sure	that	no	mediumistic	phenomena</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	endure	the	light	of	science.	At	the	end	of	their	three	sittings	they	manfully</p>
<p class="calibre1">said:	'  <i class="calibre4">Now	that	we	are	persuaded	of	the	authenticity	of	the	phenomena</i>,	we	feel	it our	 duty	 to	 state	 the	 fact	 publicly	 in	 our	 turn,	 and	 to	 proclaim	 that	 the	 few pioneers	 in	 this	 branch	 of	 biology	 (destined	 to	 become	 one	 of	 the	 most</p>
<p class="calibre1">important)	generally	saw	and	observed	correctly....	We	hope	that	our	words	may</p>
<p class="calibre1">serve	 to	 stimulate	 some	 of	 these	 colleagues	 to	 study	 personally	 and	 attentively this	group	of	interesting	and	obscure	phenomena.'	You	will	note	they	relate	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">tests,	not	to	theology,	but	to	unexplored	biology." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 like	 the	 ring	 of	 that	 declaration	 of	 theirs,"	 said	 Harris.	 "Go	 on!	 Come	 to Hecuba!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bottazzi	 was	 enormously	 impressed	 by	 this	 account,	 which	 detailed	 coldly, critically,	 the	 most	 amazing	 experiments.	 With	 ingenuity	 that	 would	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	satanic	to	Paladino	(had	she	known	of	it),	Foà	and	Aggazzotti	had	laid</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 pipes	 and	 provided	 for	 every	 trick.	 They	 were	 confident	 that	 nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">genuine	 could	 occur,	 but,	 as	 a	 matter	 of	 record,	 weird	 performances	 began	 at once.	 Bells	 were	 rung,	 tables	 shifted,	 columns	 of	 mercury	 lifted,	 mandolins</p>
<p class="calibre1">played,	and	small	objects	were	transported	quite	in	the	same	fashion	as	the	books</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	handled	during	our	own	sittings	at	your	house,	Miller—in	fact,	the	doings</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	much	the	same	in	character.	A	small	stand	was	broken	to	pieces	under	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	 eyes	 of	 the	 learned	 doctors,  <i class="calibre4">and	 hands	 hit	 and	 teeth	 bit	 those	 whom	 the</i> <i class="calibre4">medium	 did	 not	 like</i>.	 Each	 of	 the	 machines	 for	 registering	 movement,	 though utterly	 out	 of	 reach	 of	 Paladino,	 was	 operated,	 and	 some	 of	 these	 movements</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	systematically	recorded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	 was	 this	 care,	 these	 scrupulous	 and	 cold-blooded	 tests,	 that	 so	 profoundly affected	Bottazzi.	These	 men	were	his	 friends.	He	knew	 their	level-headed	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">remorseless	 accuracy.	 The	 fact	 that	 they	 considered	 the	 whole	 investigation</p>
<p class="calibre1">biologic	in	character,	and	that	the	results	of	their	experiments	strengthened	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">theory	 of	 the	 physiological	 determinism	 of	 the	 phenomena,	 added	 to	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">eagerness	to	try	for	himself." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait	 a	 moment,"	 said	 Cameron.	 "What	 do	 you	 mean	 by	 'physiological determinism'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	means	that	the	phenomena	began	and	ended	in	the	psychic's	organism." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a>"Do	you	intend	to	convey	that	they	considered	the	medium	dishonest?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh	no.	Merely	that	they	did	not	relate	the	phenomena	to	the	intervention	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">spirits	of	the	dead." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh!"	gasped	Mrs.	Cameron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Merely!"	exclaimed	Harris.	"'Merely'	is	good	in	that	case." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'After	 reading	 these	 articles	 with	 avidity,'	 Bottazzi's	 report	 begins:	 'Professor Galeotti,	 my	 associate,	 and	 I	 looked	 at	 each	 other	 astounded,	 and	 the	 same</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughts	in	the	same	words	came	simultaneously	to	our	lips:	"We,	too,	must	see, </p>
<p class="calibre1">must	 touch	 with	 our	 hands—and	 at	 once—here	 in	 this	 laboratory	 where</p>
<p class="calibre1">experiments	of	the	phenomena	of	life	are	daily	carried	on,	with	the	impartiality</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	men	whose	object	is	the	discovery	of	scientific	truth,	here	in	this	quiet	place</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	sealed	doors	will	be	superfluous.	Everything	must	be	registered.	Will	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">medium	be	able	to	impress	a	photographic	plate?	Will	she	be	able	to	illuminate	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">screen	 treated	 with	 platino-cyanide	 of	 barium?	 Will	 she	 be	 able	 to	 discharge	 a gold-leaf	electroscope	without	touching	it?"	And	so	we	travelled	on	the	wings	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagination,	 always	 having	 before	 us	 the	 plummet	 of	 the	 strictest	 scientific</p>
<p class="calibre1">methods.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now	you're	getting	into	my	horizon,"	said	Miller.	"That	is	the	way	I	wished	to proceed	in	Mrs.	Smiley's	case.	Did	Bottazzi	get	these	things	done?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're	as	impatient	as	Miss	Brush,"	I	replied,	highly	amused	at	his	eagerness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"First	 you	 must	 catch	 your	 medium.	 Bottazzi	 succeeded	 at	 last	 in	 getting Paladino's	consent,	but	only	through	the	good	offices	of	Professor	Richet,	whom</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	deeply	loves	and	reverences.	Submissively	she	entered	into	this	most	crucial</p>
<p class="calibre1">series	of	tests.	She	was	no	longer	afraid	of	any	scientist,	but	it	was	not	precisely</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	joy	to	her.	Bottazzi	invited	his	friend	Galeotti,	Professor	of	General	Pathology</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	University	of	Naples;	Dr.	de	Amicis,	Professor	of	Dermatology;	Dr.	Oscar</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scarpa,	 Professor	 of	 Electro-chemistry	 at	 the	 Polytechnic	 High	 School	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Naples;	 Luigi	 Lombardi,	 Professor	 of	 Electro-technology	 at	 the	 same	 school; </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 Dr.	 Pansini,	 Professor	 Extraordinary	 of	 Medical	 Semiotics;	 and	 these</p>
<p class="calibre1">gentlemen	certainly	made	up	a	formidable	platoon	of	investigation.	The	room	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	 the	 experiments	 took	 place	 was	 an	 isolated	 one,	 connected	 with	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">laboratory	 of	 experimental	 physiology,	 and	 belonged	 to	 that	 part	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">university	set	aside	for	Bottazzi's	exclusive	use.	Nothing	could	have	been	further</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 the	 ordinary	 stuffy	 back	 parlor	 of	 the	 'materializing	 medium.'	 No	 women</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 present,	 and	 no	 outsider;	 as	 you	 see,	 conditions	 were	 as	 nearly	 perfect	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a>the	ingenuity	of	Bottazzi	and	his	assistants	could	make	them." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 members	 present	 nestled	 into	 their	 chairs	 with	 looks	 of	 satisfaction,	 and Mrs.	Cameron	said:	"Don't	leave	anything	out.	Tell	it	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	is	hardly	necessary	to	say	that	every	precaution	was	taken.	Photographs	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cabinet	 were	 made	 before	 the	 sittings	 and	 afterward,	 in	 order	 that	 all</p>
<p class="calibre1">displacements	might	be	recorded.	Provision	was	made	for	registering	the	action</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 'John	 King's'	 spectral	 hands.	 Some	 of	 these	 devices	 were	 concealed	 in	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">adjoining	 room	 and	 watched	 by	 other	 attendants.	 One	 little	 touch	 early	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bottazzi's	 account	 impressed	 me	 deeply.	 A	 little	 electric	 motor	 was	 used	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">furnish	power	for	the	lamps	and	other	apparatus,	and	Bottazzi,	in	speaking	of	it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">says:	 'At	 the	 moment	 when	 the	 phenomena	 to	 be	 registered	 began	 to	 manifest, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 circuit	 was	 closed,  <i class="calibre4">and	 suddenly	 in	 the	 complete	 silence	 of	 the	 night	 the</i> <i class="calibre4">feeble	murmur	of	the	motor	was	heard</i>.'	I	thrill	to	the	action	of	that	faithful	little material	watch-dog.	Ghosts	and	hobgoblins	could	not	silence	or	affright	it.	After</p>
<p class="calibre1">all,	matter	is	both	persistent	and	bold." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>"But	not	sovereign,"	defiantly	called	out	Brierly;	"the	psychic	dominates	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	shall	see.	Bottazzi	declares	in	italics	that	Paladino	neither	put	her	hand	into the	cabinet	nor	knew	the	contents	of	it.	'Rarely	has	she	been	surrounded	by	such</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	 assembly	 of	 unprejudiced	 minds,	 by	 such	 strict	 and	 attentive	 intellects,'	 he declares.	 And	 when	 you	 consider	 the	 absence	 of	 women,	 the	 mystery	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">machinery,	together	with	the	stern	character	of	the	sitters,	the	medium's	courage</p>
<p class="calibre1">becomes	 marvellous.	 Perfect	 honesty	 alone	 can	 sustain	 a	 medium	 in	 such	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">ordeal.	 I	 am	 ready	 to	 agree	 that	 a	 new	 era	 began	 for	 spiritism	 when	 Eusapia entered	that	room,	April	17,	1907." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Poor	Paladino!"	sighed	Mrs.	Cameron.	"I	tremble	for	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bottazzi	 grimly	 says:	 'We	 began	 by	 restraining	 her	 inexhaustible	 mediumistic activity.	We	obliged	her	to	do	things	she	had	never	done	before.	We	limited	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">field	of	her	manifestations....	I	was	convinced	that	it	was	much	easier	for	her	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">drag	 out	 of	 the	 cabinet	 a	 heavy	 table	 than	 to	 press	 an	 electric	 knob	 or	 displace the	rod	of	a	metronome.'	And	this	theory	he	set	himself	to	prove.	It	was	beautiful</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	see	the	way	he	went	about	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Howard	 was	 also	 impressed.	 "I	 see	 Eusapia's	 finish.	 She	 won't	 do	 a	 thing.	 The influences	will	criss-cross.	Bottazzi's	cabinet	is	her	Waterloo." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Observe	 that	 Bottazzi	 was	 not	 perverse.	 He	 met	 the	 psychic	 half-way	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1">forming	 the	 usual	 chain	 about	 the	 table,	 placing	 Eusapia	 before	 the	 curtains	 of the	 little	 cabinet,	 which	 was	 a	 recess	 in	 the	 wall.	 Bottazzi	 himself	 and	 his assistants	 had	 constructed	 this	 cabinet	 and	 placed	 everything	 in	 position	 before Eusapia	entered	the	room	at	all,	and	throughout	the	sitting	she	was	controlled	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 least	 two	 of	 the	 investigators	 so	 that	 she	 could	 not	 so	 much	 as	 put	 a	 hand inside	the	curtains.	She	was	very	uneasy,	as	though	finding	the	conditions	hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless,  <i class="calibre4">even	 at	 this	 first	 sitting,	 everything	 movable	 in	 the	 cabinet	 was</i> <i class="calibre4">thrown	 about</i>.	 The	 table	 was	 violently	 shaken	 and	 the	 metronome	 set	 going. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bottazzi	 ends	 his	 first	 report	 by	 saying:	 'The	 séance	 yielded	 very	 small	 results, but	 this	 is	 always	 the	 case	 at	 first	 séances.	 Nevertheless,	 how	 many	 "  <i class="calibre4">knowing</i> people	and	 <i class="calibre4">savans</i>"	have	formed	a	judgment	on	phenomena	after	séances	such	as this	one?'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	a	slant	at	you,	Miller,"	remarked	Harris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,"	I	agreed,	"it's	a	slant	at	all	commissions	and	committees	who	think	they</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>can	 jump	 in	 and	 settle	 this	 spiritistic	 controversy	 in	 the	 course	 of	 half	 an	 hour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bottazzi,	like	Lombroso	and	Richet,	was	aware	that	he	had	entered	upon	a	long</p>
<p class="calibre1">road.	He	knew	that	a	tired	or	worried	medium	was	helpless.	He	called	the	same</p>
<p class="calibre1">circle	together	for	the	20th,	willing	to	try	patiently	for	developments.	All	came</p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 Lombardi,	 whose	 place	 was	 taken	 by	 M.	 Jona,	 an	 engineer.	 The	 second</p>
<p class="calibre1">sitting	was	a	wonder.	Warned	by	his	first	experience,	Bottazzi	nailed	or	screwed</p>
<p class="calibre1">every	 movable	 thing	 fast	 to	 the	 walls	 of	 the	 cabinet.	 He	 was	 resolute	 to	 force</p>
<p class="calibre1">'John,'	 the	 supposed	 'guide,'	 to	 touch	 the	 electric	 button	 and	 press	 the	 ball	 of India-rubber	that	connected	with	a	mercury	manometer.	He	intended	to	teach	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">spirit	 hand	 to	 register	 its	 actions	 on	 a	 revolving	 cylinder	 of	 smoked	 tin.	 He wanted	graven	records,	so	that	no	wiseacre	like	Harris,	here,	could	say:	'Oh,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing	never	moved.	You	were	all	hypnotized!'	In	effect,	he	said:	'They	tell	us	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	cold	wind	blows	from	the	cabinet.	I	will	put	a	self-registering	thermometer	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	cabinet	and	see.	They	say	tables	weighing	forty	pounds	have	been	lifted.	All</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 ask	 is	 that	 the	 bulb	 of	 a	 self-registering	 manometer	 be	 pressed.	 They	 say	 a Morse	 telegraphic	 key	 has	 been	 sounded	 by	 spirit	 hands.	 Very	 well;	 I	 will</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrange	 a	 connection	 so	 that	 every	 pressure	 of	 the	 key	 will	 be	 registered	 on	 a sheet	of	smoked	paper,	so	that	the	fact	of	the	sound	of	the	key	shall	be	recorded</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	an	infallible	instrument.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did	he	get	the	records?"	asked	Harris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait	and	see!"	commanded	Cameron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"These	indicate	the	methods	which	Bottazzi	and	his	assistants	brought	to	bear	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 medium.	 No	 more	 worship	 here,	 no	 awe,	 no	 hesitation,	 no	 superstition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among	other	things,	he	put	into	the	cabinet	a	small	table	weighing	about	fifteen</p>
<p class="calibre1">pounds,	 and	 on	 top	 of	 it	 arranged	 a	 hair-brush,	 a	 hen's	 feather,	 a	 bottle	 full	 of water,	and	a	very	thick	glass.	These	articles	and	the	table	were	the	only	objects</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	could	be	moved.	His	aim	was	to	limit	the	spirit	hands	to	a	few	movables—to</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	whether	they	could	not	be	taught	to	do	what	was	required	of	them.	Well,  <i class="calibre4">that</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">little	 table	 came	 out	 of	 the	 cabinet	 of	 its	 own	 accord	 in	 a	 light	 that	 made	 it</i> <i class="calibre4">perfectly	visible</i>,	at	the	precise	time	when	three	of	the	inexorable	professors	were rigidly	 clasping	 the	 psychic.	 But	 that	 is	 not	 the	 most	 remarkable	 thing.	 The psychic's	 feet	 were	 held	 by	 the	 engineer,	 and	 he	 observed	 that	 at	  <i class="calibre4">the	 exact</i> <i class="calibre4">moment	when	Paladino	pushed	against	his	knee	the	table	moved</i>.	'Each	advance</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	table	corresponded,'	says	Bottazzi,	'with	the	most	perfect	synchronism,	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 push	 of	 Eusapia's	 legs	 against	 Jona's	 knees';	 in	 other	 words,	 she	 really executed	 movements	 identical	 with	 those	 that	 she	 would	 have	 made	 had	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	pushing	the	table	out	of	the	cabinet	with	her	 <i class="calibre4">visible</i>	limbs." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a>As	 I	 paused	 for	 effect,	 Fowler	 said:	 "You	 say	 that	 as	 if	 you	 considered	 it	 very significant." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 do.	 In	 my	 judgment,	 it	 is	 the	 most	 valuable	 fact	 developed	 by	 these	 most searching	experiments.	Flammarion	noted	this	same	significant	relation	between</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	movements	of	the	psychic	and	the	spirit	hands,	and	so	did	Maxwell.	Maxwell</p>
<p class="calibre1">proved	it	by	experiments	on	his	own	person,	and	now	Bottazzi	is	proving	it	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">larger	way.	'A	few	moments	later,'	he	says,	'a	glass	was	flung	from	the	cabinet	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	 invisible	 agencies,	 and	 this	 fling	 coincided	 exactly	 with	 a	 kick	 which</p>
<p class="calibre1">Paladino	gave	to	Jona,	as	if	the	same	will	governed	both	movements.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller	 was	 thinking	 very	 hard.	 "That	 certainly	 is	 very	 strange,"	 he	 said,	 "but	 I observed	 nothing	 of	 it	 in	 Mrs.	 Smiley's	 case;	 on	 the	 contrary,	 it	 seemed	 to	 me that	our	strongest	manifestations	came	when	she	was	perfectly	still." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hasten!"	urged	Fowler.	"Come	to	the	phantoms.	I	perceive	his	theory,	but	it	will all	be	upset	later	by	the	materialized	forms." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"On	 the	 contrary,	 Bottazzi	 declares	 the	 phantoms	 also	 conformed	 to	 this	 same law.	He	was	determined	upon	educating	'John	King,'	and	kept	insisting	that	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">invisible	 hands	 press	 the	 rubber	 ball,	 or	 lower	 the	 registry	 balance,	 or	 set	 the metronome	going,	and	Eusapia	repeatedly	moaned:	'  <i class="calibre4">I	can't	find</i>,'	'  <i class="calibre4">I	can't	see</i>,'	or	'  <i class="calibre4">I</i> <i class="calibre4">don't	know	how</i>.'	Once	she	complained	that	the	objects	were	 <i class="calibre4">too	far	off—that	she</i> <i class="calibre4">could	 not	 reach	 them! </i>—all	 of	 which	 sustained	 Bottazzi	 in	 his	 belief	 that	 these activities	were	absolutely	under	her	psychic	control,	just	as	the	synchronism	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">movements	convinced	him	that	she	was	'the	physiologic	factor	in	the	case.'	All</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	this	is	very	exciting	to	me,	for	I	have	had	the	same	feeling	with	regard	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">several	 mediums	 whose	 activities	 I	 have	 closely	 studied.	 Bottazzi	 says,	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">regard	 to	 the	 results	 of	 the	 first	 two	 sittings:	 'These	 first	 séances	 show	 that Eusapia	needed	to	learn	how	to	make	these	movements	with	which	her	invisible</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands	 were	 unfamiliar,	 just	 as	 she	 would	 have	 had	 to	 learn	 to	 make	 them	 with her	visible	hands.	You	will	all	observe	that	he	did	not	permit	awe	or	superstitious</p>
<p class="calibre1">reverence	for	the	medium	or	her	phantoms	to	balk	his	experiments.'	A	convinced</p>
<p class="calibre1">spiritist	 who	 attended	 one	 of	 the	 séances	 was	 scandalized	 by	 the	 tone	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">character	of	the	tests.	These	professors	were	continually	bobbing	up	to	see	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 going	 on,	 disturbing	 conditions,	 stirring	 things	 up	 as	 with	 a	 spoon	 to	 see how	it	was	all	going	on.	They	broke	the	chain	of	hands	whenever	they	wanted	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	what	'the	spirits'	were	doing.	In	other	words,	these	scientists	were	students, </p>
<p class="calibre1">not	devotees.	They	were	experimenting,	not	communing	with	the	dead." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>"Others	 have	 tried	 that,"	 said	 Fowler.	 "But	 they	 succeeded	 in	 preventing	 any manifestations	whatsoever." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	didn't	work	out	so	in	this	instance.	Bottazzi	says	that	during	the	first	séance Professor	 Scarpa	 irritated	 Eusapia	 greatly	 by	 his	 impertinent	 curiosity,	 but</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bottazzi	himself	quieted	her	by	saying:	'You	see,	dear	Eusapia,	we	are	not	here</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	to	admire	the	marvellous	phenomena	you	are	able	to	produce,	but	also,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">chiefly,	to	observe	and	verify	and	criticise.	We	do	not	doubt	you	or	suspect	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">fraud,	 but	 we	 want	 to	 see	 clearly,	 and	 to	 follow	 the	 development	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">phenomena.	 That	 is	 why	 M.	 Scarpa	 surveys	 the	 cabinet	 between	 the	 curtains, </p>
<p class="calibre1">illuminating	it	occasionally	with	an	electric	pocket-lamp.	Which	do	you	prefer, </p>
<p class="calibre1">passive	 admiration,	 of	 which	 you	 must	 have	 had	 more	 than	 enough	 already,	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 calm	 affirmation	 of	 physicists	 who	 are	 accustomed	 to	 extort	 from	 Nature</p>
<p class="calibre1">secrets	 which	 she	 hides	 from	 physical	 eyes?	 'In	 this	 way,'	 adds	 the	 master, </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Eusapia's	 irritation	 was	 softened;	 she	 rebelled	 no	 further,	 but	 yielded	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">docility	 to	 the	 sharp,	 attentive	 scrutiny	 of	 the	 observer,	 who	 finally	 declared himself	 beaten,	 not	 having	 been	 able	 to	 discover	 at	 any	 point	 a	 shadow	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">fraud.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hurrah	for	Eusapia!"	shouted	Howard.	"She	must	be	a	wonder!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	spiritist	would	say	that	her	guides	were	insisting	on	the	most	rigid	test.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">account	goes	on	to	say	that	the	psychic,	when	entranced,	was	not	satisfied	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	grasp	of	two	of	the	spies;	she	frequently	asked,	in	a	faint	voice,	for	a	third	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">even	a	fourth	hand	in	order	that	there	could	be	no	question	of	her	freedom	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">connection	with	the	phenomena.	As	in	the	case	of	our	own	psychic,	Mrs.	Smiley</p>
<p class="calibre1">co-operated	to	the	utmost	with	us.	She	never	refused	to	permit	any	test." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller	 here	 remarked:	 "I	 can't	 but	 think	 that	 our	 control	 of	 Mrs.	 Smiley	 was complete,	and	yet	I	could	not	(under	the	conditions)	assert	that	she	was	not	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">author	of	the	acts	we	witnessed	in	my	library.	I	cannot	bring	myself	to	entertain, </p>
<p class="calibre1">even	 for	 an	 instant,	 the	 spirit	 hypothesis,	 but	 in	 Bottazzi's	 theory	 I	 glimpse	 an alternative." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	Bottazzi	plainly	hints	at	his	conclusions	by	saying:	'  <i class="calibre4">The	invisible	limbs</i>	of the	 psychic	 explored	 the	 cabinet.'	 He	 repeats,	 'I	 am	 convinced	 that	 these</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">"mediumistic	limbs"	are	capable	of	being	taught	unfamiliar	duties</i>,	like	pressing an	electric	button	of	squeezing	a	rubber	ball,'	and	this	he	proceeded	patiently	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">exemplify.	At	the	third	sitting	Madame	Bottazzi	was	present	(Lombardi	and	Jona</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	 absent),	 and	 the	 'force'	 was	 much	 greater	 and	 more	 active	 than	 before, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>probably	 because	 of	 the	 psychic's	 growing	 confidence.	 A	 small	 table	 floated	 in the	 air	 '  <i class="calibre4">while	 we	 watched	 it	 in	 amazement</i>,'	 he	 says.	 One	 levitation	 lasted	 long enough	to	count	fifty.	'We	all	had	time	to	observe	that	the	piece	of	furniture	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">quite	isolated,'	he	adds.	Furthermore,	a	big	black	hand	came	from	the	curtain	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">touched	 Madame	 Bottazzi	 on	 the	 cheek,	 and	 frightened	 her	 from	 her	 place</p>
<p class="calibre1">beside	the	medium." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 can	 understand	 that,"	 said	 Mrs.	 Cameron.	 "Think	 of	 being	 touched	 by	 even one's	own	dead!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Professor	de	Amicis	was	not	only	touched	on	the	arm	but	forcibly	pulled,	as	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	 an	 invisible	 hand.	 The	 curtain	 of	 the	 cabinet	 then	 enveloped	 him	 as	 if	 to embrace	 him,	 and	 he	 felt	 the	 contact	 of	 another	 face	 against	 his,	 and	 a	 mouth kissing	him—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 women	 cried	 out	 at	 the	 thought,	 but	 I	 hurried	 on	 to	 make	 Bottazzi's	 point:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">'At	the	same	time	Eusapia's	lips	moved	as	if	to	kiss,	and	she	made	the	sound	of</i> <i class="calibre4">kissing,	 which	 we	 all	 distinctly	 heard.' </i>	 Here	 again,	 you	 see,	 is	 that	 astounding synchronism	 which	 Maxwell	 and	 Morselli	 observed	 between	 the	 movement	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">objects	 and	 the	 contraction	 of	 the	 muscles	 in	 the	 medium's	 arms	 and	 legs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bottazzi	 pauses	 to	 generalize:	 'Whatever	 may	 be	 the	 mediumistic	 phenomena</p>
<p class="calibre1">produced,	 there	 is	 almost	 always	 at	 the	 same	 time	 movement	 of	 one	 or	 several parts	of	the	medium's	body.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	 does	 he	 mean?	 Does	 he	 mean	 that	 Eusapia	 performed	 all	 these</p>
<p class="calibre1">movements	with	her	'astral	hands'?"	asked	Mrs.	Quigg. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	is	precisely	his	inference.	'Mysterious	hands,'	Bottazzi	calls	them." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	how	will	he	account	for	the	difference	in	size	between	Eusapia's	hands	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 <i class="calibre4">large	black	hand</i>	that	she	saw	and	felt?"	asked	Fowler. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bottazzi	 himself	 remarks	 upon	 this	 discrepancy.	 'To	 whom	 does	 this	 hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">belong?'	he	asked—'this	hand,	a	half	a	yard	away	from	the	medium's	head,	seen</p>
<p class="calibre1">while	her	visible	hands	are	rigorously	controlled	by	her	two	neighbors?	Is	it	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand	 of	 a	 monstrous	 long	 arm	 which	 liberates	 itself	 from	 the	 medium's	 body, </p>
<p class="calibre1">then	 dissolves,	 to	 afterward	 "materialize"	 afresh?	 Is	 it	 something	 analogous	 to the	pteropod	of	an	amœba,	which	projects	itself	from	the	body,	then	retreats	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	only	to	reappear	in	another	place?	Mystery!'	But	this	is	not	the	most	grewsome</p>
<p class="calibre1">sight;	one	of	the	professors,	stealing	a	glance	behind	the	medium,	saw	remnants</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	legs	and	arms	lying	about	the	cabinet." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a>"Horrible!"	exclaimed	Mrs.	Cameron.	"I'd	rather	believe	in	spirits.	What	does	he mean	to	infer?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Apparently	he	would	have	us	believe	that	materialization	is	a	process	due	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">medium—or	at	least	dependent	on	her	will—and	that	these	partially	completed</p>
<p class="calibre1">forms	represent	fragmentary	impulses.	But	I'm	not	so	much	concerned	just	now</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 that	 as	 with	 the	 course	 of	 schooling	 through	 which	 he	 drove	 Eusapia.	 He stuck	 to	 his	 plan.	 He	 put	 into	 his	 cabinet	 each	 time	 certain	 sounders,	 markers, and	 lamps,	 which	 could	 be	 moved,	 ticked,	 or	 lighted	 only	 by	 hands	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cabinet,	 and	 he	 kept	 the	 same	 rigid	 control	 of	 his	 medium	  <i class="calibre4">outside</i>	 the	 cabinet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	the	most	part	she	was	in	the	light.	By	means	of	a	series	of	lamps	the	séance-</p>
<p class="calibre1">room	 could	 be	 lighted	 dimly	 or	 brightly	 at	 a	 touch,	 and,	 while	 many	 of	 the phenomena	in	the	cabinet	were	being	performed	by	'John,'	Eusapia's	hands	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	plainly	seen	in	the	grasp	of	her	inquisitors.	After	seeing	a	mandolin	move	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">play	of	itself,	after	having	the	metronome	set	in	motion,	stopped,	and	set	going</p>
<p class="calibre1">again,	after	having	the	registrations	he	most	desired,	Bottazzi	concludes	his	third</p>
<p class="calibre1">sitting	by	saying:	'An	invisible	hand	or	foot	 <i class="calibre4">must</i>	therefore	have	forced	down	the disk,  <i class="calibre4">must</i>	have	leaned	on	the	membrane	of	the	receiving-drum	of	my	apparatus, </p>
<p class="calibre1">because	I	assured	myself	next	day	that	to	obtain	the	highest	lines	registered	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">disk	 had	 to	 be	 pressed	 to	 the	 extreme	 point.	 This	 was	 no	 ordinary	 case	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">pushing	 or	 pulling.	 The	 mysterious	 hand	 had	 to	 push	 the	 disk,	 and	 push	 it	 in	 a certain	way.  <i class="calibre4">In	short,	the	"spirit	hand"	was	becoming	educated	to	its	task. </i>'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller	asked:	"Did	these	performances	take	place,	as	in	the	case	of	Mrs.	Smiley, </p>
<p class="calibre1">within	the	reach	of	her	ordinary	limbs?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	many	of	them	took	place	within	a	yard	of	her	head;	but	some	of	them,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	most	marvellous	of	them,	not	merely	took	place	out	of	her	reach,	but	under</p>
<p class="calibre1">conditions	of	unexampled	rigor.	'Eusapia's	mediumistic	limbs	penetrated	into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cabinet,'	 says	 Bottazzi.	 'I	 begged	 my	 friends	 not	 to	 distract	 the	 medium's</p>
<p class="calibre1">attention	 by	 requests	 for	 touches,	 apparitions,	 etc.,	 but	 to	 concentrate	 their desires	and	their	wills	on	the	things	I	asked	for....'	What	he	wanted	her	to	do	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	 simple,	 but	 conclusive.	 He	 wished	 'the	 spirit	 hand'	 to	 press	 an	 electric button	and	light	a	red	lamp	within	the	cabinet.	The	coil	and	the	switch	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">dragged	out	of	the	cabinet	and	thrown	on	the	table.	Bottazzi	begged	them	all	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	touch	it.	No	one	but	Scarpa,	Galeotti,	and	Bottazzi	knew	what	it	was	for.	'At	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">certain	 moment	 Eusapia	 took	 hold	 of	 the	 first	 finger	 of	 my	 right	 hand	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">squeezed	it	with	her	fingers.	A	ray	of	light	from	the	interior	of	the	cabinet	lit	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	room'—she	had	pressed	the	contact-breaker	with	her	invisible	fingers	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">precise	 time	 when	 she	 had	 squeezed	 with	 her	 visible	 hand	 the	 forefinger	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a>Bottazzi.	She	repeatedly	did	this.	'If	one	of	us,	be	it	observed,	had	lit	the	lamp, she	would	have	screamed	with	pain	and	indignation.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Was	 this	 the	 climax	 of	 his	 series?	 Is	 this	  <i class="calibre4">all</i>	 he	 is	 willing	 to	 affirm?"	 queried Harris,	with	ironic	inflection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh	no,	indeed.	The	greatest	is	yet	to	come.	At	the	fourth	sitting	a	new	person, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor	 Cardarelli,	 was	 introduced,	 and	 this	 new	 sitter	 disturbed	 conditions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless,	the	inexplicable	took	place.	Small	twirling	violet	flames	were	seen</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 drift	 across	 the	 cabinet	 curtains,	 and	 hands	 and	 closed	 fists	 appeared	 over Paladino's	head.	These	have	been	photographed,	by-the-way.	Some	of	them	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	ordinary	size,	and	others	at	least	three	times	larger	than	the	psychic's	hand	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">fist.	 These	 flames	 interest	 me	 very	 much,	 for	 I	 have	 seen	 them	 on	 several</p>
<p class="calibre1">occasions,	but	could	not	believe	in	them,	even	though	Crookes	spoke	of	handling</p>
<p class="calibre1">them.	I	must	admit	their	objective	reality	now.	It	is	absurd	to	suppose	they	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">fraudulently	produced	in	this	laboratory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	 stethoscope	 was	 taken	 from	 Cardarelli's	 pocket	 and	 put	 together—a</p>
<p class="calibre1">movement	requiring	the	action	of	two	hands.	The	noise	of	fingers	running	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 keys	 of	 a	 typewriter	 in	 the	 cabinet	 was	 plainly	 heard,	 although	 no	 writing came.	At	the	fifth	sitting	the	mandolin	again	moved	as	if	alive	(no	one	touching</p>
<p class="calibre1">it),	in	a	light	that	made	all	its	movements	observable;	and	as	it	did	so	 <i class="calibre4">Eusapia's</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">hand</i>	 (tightly	 controlled	 by	 Bottazzi)	  <i class="calibre4">made	 little	 movements	 as	 if	 to	 help	 the</i> <i class="calibre4">instrument	to	move</i>.  <i class="calibre4">Each	movement,	though	it	ended	in	the	air,	seemed	to	affect</i> <i class="calibre4">the	mandolin. </i>	Bottazzi	says:	'It	would	be	necessary	to	have	Paladino's	fingers	in the	palm	of	one's	hand,	as	I	had	that	evening,	in	order	to	be	convinced	that	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">evolutions,	twangings	of	the	strings,	etc.,	all	synchronized	with	the	very	delicate</p>
<p class="calibre1">movements	 of	 her	 fingers....	 I	 cannot	 describe	 the	 sensation	 one	 experiences</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	seeing	an	inanimate	object	moved,	not	for	a	moment	merely,	but	for	many</p>
<p class="calibre1">minutes	in	succession,	by	a	mysterious	force.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	observed	no	such	synchronism,"	repeated	Fowler.	"We	not	only	controlled Mrs.	Smiley's	hands,	but	nailed	her	to	her	chair.	In	a	way,	our	test	was	more	rigid</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	 those	 you	 are	 describing.	 Our	 results	 were	 not	 so	 dramatic,	 but	 they	 were produced	 under	 test	 conditions,	 and	 their	 significance	 is	 as	 great	 as	 that	 of Bottazzi's	lamp-lighting." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	we	did	not	have	as	much	light	on	the	medium,	and,	by-the-way,	Miller,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">spectral	 hands	 that	 I	 saw	 in	 your	 study,	 each	 larger	 than	 Mrs.	 Smiley's	 hands, were	as	real	to	me	as	those	Scarpa	studied,	and	the	books	deposited	on	your	table</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>form	as	good	a	record,	in	their	way,	as	the	marks	on	his	smoked-glass	cylinder." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Furthermore,	 we	 had	 writing,"	 added	 Fowler.	 "All	 of	 which	 Bottazzi	 would explain	by	his	theory	of	an	'astral	arm.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	 but	 he	 secured	 something	 still	 more	 marvellous.	 He	 obtained	 the	 print	 of human	 hands	 in	 clay	 and	 also	 on	 smoked	 glass.	 He	 demonstrated	 that	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">invisible	 limbs	 of	 the	 psychic	 cannot	 only	 move	 objects	 at	 a	 distance,  <i class="calibre4">but	 that</i> <i class="calibre4">they	 can	 feel	 at	 a	 distance</i>.	 'Eusapia's	 attitude	 was	 that	 of	 a	 blindfolded	 person exploring	space	with	her	hands	to	find	a	lost	object!'	he	exclaims,	at	one	point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Eusapia	 opened	 my	 right	 hand,	 stretched	 out	 my	 three	 middle	 fingers,	 and, </p>
<p class="calibre1">bending	them	on	the	table,	tips	downward,	said,	in	a	whisper:	"How	hard	it	is! </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	is	it?"	I	did	not	understand,'	says	Bottazzi.	'She	continued:	"There,	on	the chair."	"It	is	the	clay,"	I	said,	quickly;	"will	you	make	the	impression	of	a	face?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	 she	 replied,	 "it	 is	 too	 hard;	 take	 it	 away.'"	 Some	 one	 broke	 the	 chain	 to carry	out	her	desire.	He	looked	at	the	desk	and	saw	the	imprint	of	three	fingers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	 I	 would	 like	 to	 know	 at	 this	 point,"	 Harris	 quickly	 interposed,	 "is	 this: were	the	fingermarks	lined	like	Bottazzi's	or	like	the	medium's?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	does	not	say	in	this	case,	but,	as	I	recall	it,	they	found	in	other	instances	that the	lines	on	the	impressions	made	by	Eusapia's	invisible	fingers	were	precisely</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	 those	 of	 her	 material	 fingers,	 and	 yet	 no	 mark	 of	 flour	 or	 lamp-black</p>
<p class="calibre1">remained	 attaching	 to	 her	 hands.	 In	 one	 case	 a	 perfumed	 clay	 was	 used,	 and, although	the	impressions	secured	'resembled	Eusapia's	face	grown	old,'	no	scent</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	wax	could	be	detected	on	her	cheeks.	Bottazzi	gives	much	space	to	these</p>
<p class="calibre1">'mediumistic	 explorations	 of	 the	 cabinet.'	 He	 could	 follow	 these	 blind, </p>
<p class="calibre1">mysterious	 gropings	 of	 the	 invisible	 Eusapia	 by	 closely	 controlling	 the	 real</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eusapia.	 'Presently	 she	 asked:	 "What	 is	 that	 round	 object?	 I	 feel	 something round."'	This	was,	in	fact,	the	rubber	ball	which	connected	with	a	tube—the	tube, </p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 its	 turn,	 passing	 through	 the	 wall	 into	 another	 room	 where	 it	 operated	 a manometer.	She	pressed	this	ball	with	her	invisible	limbs,	and	the	column	rose</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	registered	the	pressure.	This	was	entirely	satisfactory	to	Bottazzi,	who	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">says:	 'I	 desire	 again	 to	 affirm	 that	 with	 her	 invisible	 limbs	 Eusapia	 feels	 the forms	of	objects	and	their	consistency,	feels	heat	and	cold,	hardness	and	softness, </p>
<p class="calibre1">dampness	 and	 dryness	 neither	 more	 nor	 less	 than	 if	 she	 were	 touching	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">feeling	 with	 the	 hands	 imprisoned	 in	 ours.	 She	 feels	 with	 other	 hands,	 but</p>
<p class="calibre1">perceives	with	the	same	brain	with	which	she	uses	to	talk	with	us.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	most	astonishing	physical	phenomena	came	when	the	contact-breaker	was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a>thrown	on	the	table,	and	Eusapia	called	out:	'See	how	it	moves!'	'  <i class="calibre4">We	all	directed</i> <i class="calibre4">our	 gaze	 toward	 the	 small	 object</i>,'	 says	 Bottazzi,	 '  <i class="calibre4">and	 we	 saw	 that	 it	 oscillated</i> <i class="calibre4">and	vibrated	at	an	elevation	of	an	inch	or	two	above	the	surface	of	the	table,	as</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">if	 seized	 with	 internal	 shivering—Eusapia's	 hands,	 held	 by	 M.	 Galeotti	 and</i> <i class="calibre4">myself,	being	more	than	a	foot	from	the	contact-breaker</i>.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 auditors	 were	 now	 in	 the	 thrall	 of	 Bottazzi's	 story,	 and	 the	 silence	 was eloquent.	At	last	Cameron	said:	"It	certainly	seems	like	a	clear	case	of	'astral.'	I begin	to	believe	in	our	first	sitting	with	Mrs.	Smiley.	What	do	you	want	us	to	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">—announce	ourselves	converted?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Certainly	 not,"	 I	 replied.	 "We	 must	 not	 relax	 our	 vigilance,	 even	 though Bottazzi,	Morselli,	and	their	fellows	seem	to	have	proved	the	genuineness	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">phenomena.	At	the	same	time,	I	admit	it	is	a	source	of	satisfaction	to	me	to	know</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 these	 Italian	 scientists,	 with	 conditions	 all	 their	 own,	 are	 willing	 to	 affirm that	Eusapia	'  <i class="calibre4">feels	with	her	invisible	limbs</i>,'	and	explores	a	cabinet	while	sitting under	 rigid	 control	 more	 than	 a	 yard	 away	 from	 the	 objects	 moved.	 My</p>
<p class="calibre1">experiences	 point	 to	 this.	 How	 else	 could	 the	 cone	 be	 handled	 with	 such</p>
<p class="calibre1">precision	 as	 was	 shown	 at	 your	 house,	 Miller?	 Lombroso	 observed	 that	 chairs</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	vases	moved	as	if	guided	by	hands	and	eyes,	and	that	the	psychic	could	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 well	 behind	 her	 as	 in	 front.	 Mrs.	 Smiley	 has	 always	 been	 able	 to	 direct	 me <i class="calibre4">exactly</i>	 to	 the	 point	 where	 the	 cone	 or	 pencil	 had	 been	 flung.	 How	 can	 letters within	closed	slates	be	formed	so	beautifully	and	so	precisely	without	some	form</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	seeing?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fowler	was	ready	with	an	answer:	"At	the	final	analysis	all	perception	is	due	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	form	of	vibration.	To	be	clairaudient	is	simply	to	be	able	to	lay	hold	upon	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">different	 set	 of	 pulsations	 in	 the	 ether,	 and	 to	 be	 clairvoyant	 is	 to	 perceive directly	without	the	aid	of	the	eye,	which	is	only	a	little	camera,	after	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	this	is	merely	a	kind	of	prelude,"	I	resumed,	"for	Bottazzi	apparently	proved that	 the	 invisible	 hand	 of	 Eusapia's	 invisible	 arm	 could	 not	 penetrate	 a	 cage	 of wire	 mesh	 that	 covered	 the	 telegraphic	 key	 in	 the	 cabinet.	 'How,	 then,	 can	 we consider	 it	 to	 be	 a	 spirit	 hand—an	 immaterial	 hand—when	 a	 wire-netting	 can</p>
<p class="calibre1">stop	it?'	he	very	pertinently	inquires." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	what	troubles	me,"	said	Miller.	"If	a	phantom	hand	can	bring	a	real	book and	 thumb	 its	 leaves,	 or	 drum	 with	 a	 real	 pencil	 or	 write,	 why	 isn't	 it,	 for	 all practicable	purposes,	a	real	hand?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	  <i class="calibre4">is</i>	 a	 real	 hand?"	 retorted	 Fowler.	 "Isn't	 the	 latest	 word	 of	 science	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a>effect	that	matter	like	the	human	body	is	only	a	temporary	condition	of	force?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Precisely	 so;	 and	 every	 advance	 along	 the	 line	 of	 these	 experiments	 goes	 to prove	the	power	of	mind	to	transform	matter.	It	almost	seems	to	me	at	times	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">though	 these	 psychic	 minds	 were	 able	 to	 reduce	 matter	 to	 its	 primal	 atom	 and reshape	 it.	 In	 Bottazzi's	 seventh	 sitting,	 under	 the	 same	 rigorous	 restraint	 of Eusapia,	a	vase	of	flowers	was	transported,	a	rose	was	set	in	a	lady's	hair,	a	small</p>
<p class="calibre1">drum	was	seized	and	beaten	rhythmically,	an	enormous	black	fist	came	out	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind	 the	 curtain,	 and	 an	 open	 hand	 seized	 Bottazzi	 gently	 by	 the	 neck.	 Now listen	to	his	own	words:	'Letting	go	my	hold	of	Professor	Poso's	hand,'	he	says,	'I</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt	for	this	ghostly	hand	and	clasped	it.  <i class="calibre4">It	was	a	left	hand,	neither	hot	nor	cold,</i> <i class="calibre4">with	 rough,	 bony	 fingers	 which	 dissolved	 under	 pressure.	 It	 did	 not	 retire	 by</i> <i class="calibre4">producing	a	sensation	of	withdrawal—it	dissolved,	"dematerialized,"	melted. </i>'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 paused	 to	 say:	 "Remember,	 this	 is	 not	 the	 tale	 of	 a	 perfervid	 spiritist.	 On	 the contrary,	it	is	the	scientific	account	of	a	laboratory	experiment	by	a	physiologist</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	high	rank.	The	incident	is	not	a	part	of	a	séance	in	the	home	of	a	medium	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">dark	parlor	full	of	side-doors	and	trick	windows.	It	is	a	registered	phenomenon</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	physiological	department	of	a	great	university,	occurring	under	scientific</p>
<p class="calibre1">test	conditions.	I	confess	it	gives	verity	to	many	a	doubtful	thing	I	have	myself</p>
<p class="calibre1">seen." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	 certainly	 staggers	 me,"	 said	 Cameron.	 "How	 does	 the	 scientific	 gentleman explain	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	 goes	 on	 to	 say:	 'Another	 time,	 later	 on,	 the	 same	 hand	 was	 placed	 on	 my right	 forearm—I	 saw	 a	 human	 hand,	 of	 natural	 color,	 and	 I	 felt	 with	 mine	 the back	of	a	lukewarm	hand,	rough	and	nervous.  <i class="calibre4">The	hand	dissolved	(I	saw	it	with</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">my	 own	 eyes)	 and	 retreated	 as	 if	 into	 Madame	 Paladino's	 body,	 describing	 a</i> <i class="calibre4">curve. </i>	 If	 all	 the	 observed	 phenomena	 of	 these	 seven	 séances	 were	 to	 disappear from	my	memory,	this	one	I	could	never	forget.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fowler	was	smiling	with	calm	disdain.	"Let	him	go	on	with	his	psycho-dynamic</p>
<p class="calibre1">theories.	He	will	be	confounded	yet.	These	are	only	the	first	stages	of	the	game." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	 all	 this	 happened	 while	 the	 hands	 of	 the	 psychic	 were	 merely	 held," </p>
<p class="calibre1">protested	 Miller.	 "He	 says	 he	 controlled	 her	 hands	 rigorously.	 Why	 didn't	 he handcuff	her,	or	nail	her	down?	The	facts	he	claims	to	have	established	are	too</p>
<p class="calibre1">subversive	to	accept	on	his	word	alone." </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 amused	 me.	 "There	 you	 go	 again!	 Not	 satisfied	 with	 wonders,	 you	 want</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>miracles.	Happily,	you	may	be	satisfied.	In	the	eighth	sitting,	which	took	place	in the	same	room	of	the	physiological	laboratory,	with	Bottazzi,	Madame	Bottazzi, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor	 Galeotti,	 Doctors	 Jappelli	 and	 d'Errico	 present,	 Eusapia	 submitted	 to the	most	rigorous	restraint	of	her	life.	Two	iron	rings	were	fastened	to	the	floor, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	by	means	of	strong	cords,	which	were	sealed	with	lead	seals	like	those	used</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 fastening	 a	 railway	 car,	 her	 wrists	 were	 rigidly	 confined.	 She	 was,	 in	 fact, bound	like	a	criminal;	and	yet	the	spectral	hands	and	fists	came	and	went,	jugs	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">water	 floated	 about,	 and	 as	 a	 final	 stupendous	 climax,	 while	 Galeotti	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">controlling	 Eusapia's	 right	 arm,	 which	 was	 also	 manacled,	 he	  <i class="calibre4">saw</i>	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">duplications	of	her	left	arm.	'LOOK!'	he	exclaimed,	'I	SEE	TWO	LEFT	ARMS	IDENTICAL</p>
<p class="calibre1">IN	APPEARANCE.	ONE	IS	ON	THE	LITTLE	TABLE.	THE	OTHER	SEEMS	TO	COME	OUT	OF	THE</p>
<p class="calibre1">MEDIUM'S	SHOULDER,	TOUCH	MADAME	BOTTAZZI,	AND	THEN	RETURN	TO	EUSAPIA'S	BODY</p>
<p class="calibre1">AGAIN.	THIS	IS	NOT	AN	HALLUCINATION.	I	AM	CONSCIOUS	OF	TWO	SIMULTANEOUS	VISUAL</p>
<p class="calibre1">SENSATIONS	WHEN	MADAME	BOTTAZZI	SAYS	SHE	HAS	BEEN	TOUCHED.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	moment	the	entire	company	sat	in	silence,	as	though	stunned	by	the	force</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	my	blow.	Then	all	turned	to	Miller	as	though	to	ask:	"What	do	you	think	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	slowly	replied:	"To	grant	the	possible	putting	forth	of	a	supernumerary	arm</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	hand	would	make	physiological	science	foolish.	It	is	easier	to	imagine	these</p>
<p class="calibre1">gentlemen	suffering	a	collective	hallucination." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah!	 Bottazzi	 provided	 against	 all	 that.	 He	 called	 in	 the	 aid	 of	 self-registering contrivances.	 It	 won't	 do,	 Miller—he	 proved	 the	 objective	 reality	 of	 'spirit</p>
<p class="calibre1">phenomena.'	 He	 lifted	 the	 whole	 performance	 to	 the	 plane	 of	 the	 test-tube,	 the electric	 light,	 and	 the	 barometer.	 His	 experiments,	 his	 deductions,	 came	 as	 a splendid	 sequence	 to	 an	 almost	 equally	 searching	 series	 by	 Crookes,	 Zöllner, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wallace,	 Thury,	 Flammarion,	 Maxwell,	 Lombroso,	 Richet,	 Foà,	 and	 Morselli. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	laboratory	was	the	crucible	wherein	came	the	final	touch	of	heat	which	fuses</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	the	discordant	facts	into	a	solid	ingot	of	truth." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But,	to	me,	he	is	misreading	the	facts,"	objected	Fowler.	"I	maintain	that	he	is as	 prejudiced	 in	 his	 way	 as	 the	 spiritist.	 He	 says:	 'The	 mediumistic	 limbs</p>
<p class="calibre1">explored	the	cabinet.'	A	spiritist	would	say:	'  <i class="calibre4">John	King</i>	explored	the	cabinet.'	The synchronism	he	speaks	of	might	exist,	and	only	be	a	proof	of	what	the	spiritist</p>
<p class="calibre1">admits—that	 the	 presence	 and	 activity	 of	 the	 materializing	 spirit	 are	 closely</p>
<p class="calibre1">circumscribed	by	the	medium." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bottazzi	 proved	 the	 relationship	 to	 be	 something	 more	 intimate	 than	 that.	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a>demonstrated	that	the	movement	of	the	hands	in	the	cabinet	and	of	those	outside had	 a	 common	 origin—namely,	 the	 will	 and	 brain	 of	 Eusapia.	 He	 proved	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	 invisible	 hands	 were,	 after	 all,	 material,	 and	 limited	 in	 their	 powers.	 He proved	that	the	'spirits'	shared	all	Eusapia's	likes	and	dislikes,	and	knew	no	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	chloride	of	iron	or	ferro-cyanide	of	potassium	than	she	herself	possessed—in</p>
<p class="calibre1">short,	 while	 admitting	 the	 mystery	 of	 the	 process,	 he	 reduces	 all	 these</p>
<p class="calibre1">phenomena	to	human,	terrestrial	level,	and	relates	them	wholly	and	simply	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">brain	and	will	of	the	psychic.	Perhaps	his	state	of	mind	is	best	expressed	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">close	of	his	statement	concerning	the	registration	of	the	movements	of	'the	spirit</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand.'	 He	 says,	 in	 effect:	 'These	 tracings	 demonstrate	 irrefutably	 that	 the	 keys were	 repeatedly	 pressed	 with	 perfect	 synchronism,	 the	 outside	 key	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eusapia's	 left	 hand,	 the	 one	 inside	 the	 cabinet	 by	 another,	 which	 a	 convinced spiritist	 would	 call	 that	 of	 a	 "materialized	 spirit,"	 and	 which	 I	 believe	 to	 be neither	the	one	nor	the	other,	although	I	am	not	able	to	explain	what	it	was.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	lame	and	impotent	conclusion!"	exclaimed	Brierly.	"After	that	superb	test, why	didn't	he	frankly	say	the	discarnate	had	been	proved?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Because	 his	 proof,	 his	 knowledge,	 was	 not	 yet	 sufficient.	 Besides,	 it	 requires heroic	 courage	 to	 admit	 our	 ignorance.	 'I	 don't	 know,'	 he	 says,	 and	 that	 is	 the attitude	of	Morselli.	Dr.	Foà	believes	the	phenomena	to	come	within	the	domain</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	natural	law,	and	to	result	from	a	transmutation	of	energy	accumulated	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">medium.	 He	 calls	 this	 'vital	 energy'	 or	 'psychic	 energy,'	 and	 adds:	 'If	 these phenomena	 appear	 strange	 by	 virtue	 of	 their	 comparative	 rarity,	 they	 are	 not</p>
<p class="calibre1">really	more	marvellous	than	the	biological	phenomena	which	we	witness	every</p>
<p class="calibre1">day.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"According	to	this	theory,	then,"	said	Miller,	"Mrs.	Smiley	has	remained,	as	you believe,	motionless	in	her	chair,	but	has	been	able	to	'energize'	at	a	distance." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"More	than	that.	She	has	been	able	to	emit	supernumerary	etheric	limbs,	perhaps</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 complete	 material	 double	 of	 herself,	 which	 is	 able	 to	 move	 with	 lightning</p>
<p class="calibre1">speed	 and	 perfect	 precision.	 It	 is	 this	 actual	 externalization	 of	 both	 matter	 and sense	 that	 makes	 darkness	 so	 essential	 to	 the	 medium.	 Vivid	 light	 forces	 this effluvia,	 this	 mysterious	 double,	 back	 into	 its	 originating	 body	 with	 disrupting haste.	 Witness	 the	 several	 times	 when	 Mrs.	 Smiley	 was	 convulsed	 merely	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	touched	at	the	wrong	moment." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	is	a	different	interpretation	to	be	put	upon	the	psychic's	hatred	of	light," </p>
<p class="calibre1">remarked	Howard. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>"By-the-way,	 yet	 bearing	 on	 this	 very	 subject,	 I	 read	 in	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Annals	 of	 Psychic</i> <i class="calibre4">Science</i>	 the	 account	 of	 a	 singular	 experiment	 in	 the	 matter	 of	 independent writing.	 A	 certain	 Dr.	 Encausse,	 in	 giving	 a	 lecture	 before	 the	 Society	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Psychical	Research	at	Nancy,	said	that	in	1889,	having	heard	that	a	professional</p>
<p class="calibre1">magnetizer	named	Robert	was	able	to	put	a	subject	into	such	a	state	of	hypnosis</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	he	could	project	lines	of	writing	on	paper	without	use	of	pen	or	pencil,	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 curious	 to	 see	 the	 performance.	 Together	 with	 a	 colleague,	 Dr.	 Gibier, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Encausse	 hastened	 to	 witness	 this	 marvel.	 One	 of	 the	 subjects	 was	 a	 girl	 of seventeen.	 The	 magnetizer	 put	 her	 to	 sleep,	 'and	 during	 this	 séance,'	 says	 Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Encausse,	 'we	 were	 able	 to	 obtain	 in	 full	 light	 on	 a	 sheet	 of	 paper	 signed	 by twenty	 witnesses,	 the	 precipitation	 of	 a	 whole	 page	 of	 written	 verses	 signed</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Corneille."	 I	 examined	 under	 the	 microscope	 the	 substance	 that	 formed	 the writing,	 and	 I	 was	 led	 to	 the	 conclusion	 that	 it	 consisted	 of	 globules	 of	 human blood,	 some	 scattered	 as	 if	 calcined,	 others	 quite	 distinct.	 I	 thus	 verified	 the theory	of	the	occultists	of	1850	that	the	nervous	energy	as	well	as	the	physical</p>
<p class="calibre1">force	 of	 a	 medium,	 the	 material	 of	 which	 he	 is	 constituted,	 such	 as	 his	 blood, could	exteriorize	itself	and	reconstruct	itself	at	a	distance.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	a	stunning	experiment!"	exclaimed	Cameron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Important,	if	true,"	sneered	Harris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	do	you	know	about	this	learned	doctor?"	asked	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothing;	 but	 you	 will	 see	 that	 these	 later	 experiments	 of	 the	 Italian	 scientists are	 sustaining	 De	 Rochas	 and	 Aksakof	 in	 their	 claim	 that	 the	 medium	 is	 in	 a sense	 dematerialized	 to	 build	 up	 the	 phantasms.	 Dr.	 Encausse	 goes	 on	 to	 say:</p>
<p class="calibre1">'  <i class="calibre4">Moreover,	 the	 medium	 who	 had	 produced	 this	 phenomenon	 was	 preparing	 for</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">the	 stage	 and	 had	 been	 studying</i>	  <i class="calibre4">Corneille	 during	 the	 whole	 of	 the	 preceding</i> <i class="calibre4">day. </i>	I	was	thus	able	to	discover	the	origin	of	the	substance	of	the	materialization of	 the	 writing,	 and	 also	 its	 psychic	 origin.'	 In	 other	 words,	 he	 claims	 that	 the message	was	not	from	the	shade	of	the	great	dramatist,	but	was	a	precipitation	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	blood	of	the	psychic	and	an	exercise	of	her	subconscious	mind,	all	of	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">accords	with	Bottazzi's	theory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now,	then,"	said	I,	in	the	tone	of	one	about	to	conclude,	"in	the	light	of	these experiments,	 my	 own	 sitting	 at	 Miller's,	 and	 especially	 those	 that	 I	 held	 at Fowler's	 house,	 take	 on	 the	 greatest	 significance.	 Miller,	 Mrs.	 Smiley's	  <i class="calibre4">visible</i> <i class="calibre4">limbs</i>	 did	 not	 handle	 the	 books—of	 that	 I	 am	 positive—and	 yet	 I	 am	 equally certain	that	she	governed	every	movement." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a>"But	 what	 about	 the	 voices?"	 asked	 Fowler.	 "Does	 this	 theory	 cover	 the whispering	personalities	we	heard?	What	about	'Wilbur'	and	'Maudie'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	easy,"	retorted	Howard.	"Once	you	explain	the	manipulation	of	the	cone, the	rest	is	merely	clever	ventriloquism." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	is	nothing	'easy'	about	any	of	these	phenomena,"	I	answered.	"As	Richet says,	 they	 are	 absurd,	 but	 they	 are	 observed	 facts.	 It	 would	 not	 be	 fair	 to	 the spiritists	 to	 end	 the	 account	 of	 these	 sittings	 without	 frankly	 stating	 that	 there were	many	other	phenomena	very	difficult	to	explain	by	Bottazzi's	theory.	There</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	a	time,	as	he	admits,	when	'a	mysterious	entity	behind	the	curtain,	among</p>
<p class="calibre1">us,	almost	in	contact	with	us,	was	felt	all	the	time.'	This	entity	was	supposed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	'John	King,'	the	psychic's	control.	This	being,	invisible	for	the	most	part,	gave</p>
<p class="calibre1">roses	 to	 those	 he	 liked,	 conversed	 freely,	 and	 in	 one	 case	 threw	 a	 bunch	 of flowers	in	the	face	of	one	of	the	sitters	to	whom	Eusapia	had	taken	a	dislike.	A</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	 later	 'John'	 presented	 a	 small	 drum	 from	 behind	 the	 curtain,	 and,	 when Galeotti	tried	to	take	it,	'John'	pulled	it	out	of	his	hands.	Again	he	offered	it,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Galeotti	seized	it,	and	the	two	fought	for	its	possession	with	such	violence	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	drum	was	nearly	torn	to	pieces." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where	was	Paladino	meanwhile?"	asked	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Seated	 quietly	 in	 the	 grasp	 of	 Bottazzi	 and	 Madame	 Bottazzi.	 Galeotti	 then raised	 the	 drum	 in	 his	 hand,	 high	 above	 his	 head	 and	 against	 the	 curtain,	 and requested	 'John'	 to	 beat	 it.	 'John'	 pushed	 a	 hand	 against	 the	 drum	 and	 beat	 a muffled	tattoo.	All	this	was	utterly	out	of	the	psychic's	reach.	The	strife	over	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">drum	would	seem	to	argue	a	complete	and	powerful	figure	behind	the	curtain." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In	other	words,	a	spirit,"	said	Brierly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	so	fast,"	put	in	Miller.	"I	am	content	to	plod	with	these	Italian	scientists.	Let us	establish	 one	 supernormal	 fact	 and	 then	 reach	 for	 another.	 You	 fellows	 with your	'reincarnations,'	and	the	spiritist	with	his	foolish	messages	from	Cleopatra, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Raphael,	and	Shakespeare,	have	confused	the	situation.	We	must	begin	all	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">again.	 If	 all	 that	 Garland	 is	 detailing	 is	 true—I	 have	 not	 read	 these	 reports	 he speaks	of—then	it	is	our	duty	to	take	up	the	scrutiny	of	these	facts	as	a	part	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">biologic	science." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fowler	clapped	his	hands.	"Bravo!	that	is	all	we	ask	of	you.	To	study	frogs	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">mosquitoes,	to	peer	close	into	the	constitution	of	the	blood	or	the	brain	of	man, </p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 useful;	 but,	 to	 my	 mind,	 the	 questions	 raised	 by	 these	 Continental</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a>experimentalists	are	the	most	vital	now	clamoring	for	answer." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bottazzi	 says,	 with	 regard	 to	 his	 eighth	 and	 final	 sitting:	 'The	 results	 of	 this séance	 were	 very	 favorable,	 because	 they	 eliminated	 the	 slightest	 trace	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">suspicion	 or	 uncertainty	 relative	 to	 the	 genuineness	 of	 the	 phenomena.	 We</p>
<p class="calibre1">obtained	the	same	kind	of	assurance	as	that	which	we	have	concerning	physical, </p>
<p class="calibre1">chemical,	 or	 physiological	 phenomena.	 Henceforth	 sceptics	 can	 only	 deny	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">facts	by	accusing	us	of	fraud	and	charlatanism.	I	should	be	very	much	surprised</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	 any	 one	 were	 bold	 enough	 to	 bring	 the	 charge	 against	 us,	 but	 it	 would	 not disturb	our	minds	in	the	least.	From	this	time	forward	the	medium	who	wishes	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">prove	 the	 truth	 of	 her	 phenomena	 will	 be	 obliged	 to	 permit	 the	 same	 kind	 of experimentation	which	Eusapia	so	adequately	sustained.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	now,"	said	Cameron,	"the	practical	question	is	this:	are	we	to	go	on	with our	investigation?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	am	ready,"	 said	Miller,	promptly.	 "Garland,	will	you	 purvey	another	 psychic and	conduct	the	pursuit?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	provided	you	all	come	in	with	spirits	attuned,	ready	to	wait	patiently	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">observe	silently.	The	law	of	these	materializations	seems	to	be	this:	the	forces	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 psychic	 are	 proportional	 to	 the	 harmoniousness	 of	 the	 circle	 and	 in	 inverse proportion	 to	 the	 light.	 Accepting	 this	 law	 as	 proved	 by	 our	 illustrious	 fellow-experimenters	 abroad,	 are	 you	 ready	 to	 try	 again	 along	 the	 lines	 they	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">marked	out?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	with	one	voice,	all	agreed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Very	well,"	said	I;	"I	will	see	what	I	can	do	for	you	in	the	way	of	a	new	psychic and	new	phenomena.	We	will	now	experiment	with	design	to	prove	the	identity</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	reappearing	dead.	Of	this	I	am	fully	persuaded.	Men	will	be	discovering</p>
<p class="calibre1">new	 laws	 of	 nature	 ten	 thousand	 years	 from	 now,	 just	 as	 they	 are	 to-day.	 It	 is inconceivable	that	the	secrets	of	the	universe	should	ever	be	entirely	made	plain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	world	of	mystery	retires	before	the	dawn.	Nothing	is	really	explained—what</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	call	familiar	facts	are	at	bottom	inexplicable	mysteries,	and	must	ever	remain</p>
<p class="calibre1">so." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	 why	 go	 on?	 Why	 not	 stop	 now	 and	 save	 ourselves	 the	 trouble	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">investigation?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Because	there	is	joy	in	the	pursuit—because	it	is	in	the	nature	of	man	to	pursue</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>this	quest.	Who	knows	but	the	conclusions	of	Venzano	and	Morselli,	of	Bottazzi and	Foà,	have	opened	new	vistas	in	human	nature?	These	'supernormal	powers' </p>
<p class="calibre1">may	 chance	 to	 be	 of	 immense	 value	 to	 the	 race,	 quite	 aside	 from	 their	 bearing upon	 the	 problem	 of	 death.	 Furthermore,	 these	 reports	 come	 at	 a	 time	 when	 a hard-and-fast	 literalism	 of	 interpretation	 is	 the	 fashion	 among	 scientists	 like Miller.	Perhaps	they	and	the	art	of	the	day	will	alike	be	offered	new	inspiration</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	 these	 mystifying	 enlargements	 of	 human	 faculty.	 I	 for	 one	 feel	 profoundly</p>
<p class="calibre1">indebted	 to	 these	 brave	 and	 clear-brained	 Italian	 scientists.	 I	 should	 like	 to	 see the	 physicists	 of	 our	 own	 universities	 busying	 themselves	 with	 this	 most</p>
<p class="calibre1">absorbing	and	vital	problem." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	they	don't,"	retorted	Fowler.	"They	will	not	even	read	Bottazzi's	reports." </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	I	fear	he	is	justified	in	his	belief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[As	 I	 am	 reading	 proof	 on	 this	 page	 a	 fat	 letter	 from	 a	 friend	 in	 Naples</p>
<p class="calibre1">comes	 to	 my	 desk,	 filled	 with	 the	 several	 corroborative	 accounts	 of	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">special	 sitting	 with	 Paladino	 which	 Professor	 Bottazzi	 kindly	 arranged	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1">them.	My	correspondent	is	a	New	York	editor,	and	in	his	party	of	six	was</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a><b class="calibre3">VIII</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Cameron's	 society	 never	 came	 together	 again	 in	 formal	 session,	 and	 I	 was	 not able	to	carry	out	my	plan	for	developing	a	psychic	along	the	line	of	proving	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">identity	of	the	spirits	manifesting.	However,	between	the	final	sitting	of	the	club</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	my	next	meeting	with	Fowler	and	Miller,	I	passed	through	a	series	of	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">interesting	 experiences	 more	 or	 less	 corroborative	 of	 the	 phenomena	 which	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">members	 had	 witnessed	 either	 individually	 or	 as	 a	 body.	 These	 additional</p>
<p class="calibre1">experiments	I	proceeded	at	once	to	lay	before	my	friends	as	we	met	at	the	club</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	quiet	afternoon	a	couple	of	weeks	later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	haven't	heard	of	any	new	psychic,"	Miller	began	at	once,	as	we	settled	into easy-chairs	in	a	retired	corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	 I	 replied.	 "I've	 been	 unable	 to	 get	 the	 consent	 of	 any	 other	 psychic	 to undergo	 just	 the	 inquisition	 I	 know	 you'd	 like	 to	 give,	 but	 I've	 had	 some</p>
<p class="calibre1">extremely	suggestive	sittings	recently	with	a	young	professional	man	who	does	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	mediumistic	'work'	on	the	side." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	male	psychic?	That's	amusing.	I	thought	they	were	all	female." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No.	 There	 are	 men	 psychics,"	 replied	 Fowler,	 "but	 they're	 scarce.	 One	 of	 the most	 wonderful	 I	 have	 ever	 known	 is	 a	 big,	 burly	 fellow	 of	 most	 aggressive</p>
<p class="calibre1">manner.	The	reason	why	there	are	so	few	men	in	the	business	I	take	to	be	this:</p>
<p class="calibre1">men	are	less	subjective,	less	passive,	than	women,	and	the	psychic's	rôle	seems</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	be	a	negative	one.	Men	are	aggressive	and	impatient,	engaged	in	some	kind	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">struggle	with	material	things,	or	they	are	intolerant	of	the	process	of	developing</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	psychic	gifts.	If	Garland	has	found	a	male	psychic,	he	is	in	luck." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	I	thought.	The	young	fellow,	whom	we	will	call	Peters,	is	only	about	twenty-</p>
<p class="calibre1">four,	a	boyish	professional	man	of	refined	habits.	He	comes	of	good	family,	and, </p>
<p class="calibre1">being	 ambitious	 in	 his	 profession,	 is	 careful	 not	 to	 permit	 a	 knowledge	 of	 his psychical	 powers	 to	 reach	 the	 ears	 of	 his	 employers.	 I	 heard	 of	 him	 through	 a friend	 who	 is	 deeply	 interested	 in	 these	 matters,	 and	 who	 procured	 for	 me	 an invitation	 to	 be	 present	 at	 a	 sitting	 in	 the	 home	 of	 a	 certain	 Dr.	 Towne,	 on	 the East	Side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	 met	 at	 dinner,	 and	 during	 the	 meal	 Dr.	 Towne	 told	 us	 all	 he	 knew	 of	 Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>Peters,	which	was	little,	and,	turning	to	me,	said:	'We	expect	you	to	take	charge of	the	circle,	Mr.	Garland;	it's	all	new	to	us.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'The	first	thing	to	do,'	I	answered,	'is	to	put	the	young	fellow	at	his	ease.	It	is	a mighty	 good	 sign	 when	 a	 medium	 is	 willing	 to	 come	 into	 a	 strange	 house	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">perform	for	a	circle	as	critical	and	as	unfriendly	as	this.'	'Oh,	not	unfriendly,'	said</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	 Towne.	 'Well,'	 I	 said,	 'I	 wouldn't	 call	 three	 practising	 physicians,	 who	 have never	seen	a	psychic	at	close	range,	a	friendly	group.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Were	there	three	doctors	present?"	asked	Fowler. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	and	my	friend	was	a	notably	keen-eyed	man	himself.	I	really	had	no	faith</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	the	young	fellow	could	do	anything	remarkable	for	us,	but	I	didn't	say	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	were	still	at	the	table	when	our	young	psychic	was	announced,	and,	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowledge	of	how	necessary	it	was	that	he	should	be	in	a	comfortable	frame	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind,	I	went	out	to	the	library	to	meet	him	and	make	his	acquaintance.	I	wished</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	put	him	at	his	ease—so	far	as	I	was	concerned,	at	least. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	found	him	to	be	but	a	pale	stripling,	with	slender	limbs	and	brilliant	eyes.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 plainly	 nervous	 and	 a	 little	 dogmatic	 in	 manner.	 He	 told	 me	 that	 he	 was twenty-four	years	of	age,	but	he	did	not	look	to	be	nineteen.	He	said	he	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">aware	of	his	power	about	four	years,	and	that	his	grandfather	and	a	man	named</p>
<p class="calibre1">'Evans'	 were	 those	 who	 most	 frequently	 spoke.	 'I	 have	 no	 "guides,"'	 he	 said, rather	contemptuously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	place	for	the	sitting	was	not	especially	favorable.	It	was	a	reception-room</p>
<p class="calibre1">midway	 between	 the	 doctor's	 office	 and	 the	 dining-room,	 and	 was	 rather	 large</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	difficult	to	close	off	from	the	rest	of	the	house.	After	the	windows	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">darkened	 in	 the	 usual	 manner,	 Peters	 arranged	 the	 chairs	 so	 that	 his	 seat	 came between	 Dr.	 Towne	 and	 Mrs.	 Towne.	 Dr.	 Merriam	 came	 next	 to	 Towne.	 This</p>
<p class="calibre1">brought	 me	 two	 places	 away	 from	 Peters	 and	 next	 to	 a	 stout	 German	 woman</p>
<p class="calibre1">whose	name,	as	I	understood	it,	was	Mrs.	Steinert.	On	Mrs.	Towne's	right	sat	Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Paul	 and	 Professor	 Franks,	 my	 friend.	 Within	 the	 circle	 Towne	 had	 set	 a	 small table,	on	which	were	placed	pencils	and	paper.	The	chain	was	formed	by	locking</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	 little	 fingers	 tightly.	 If	 we	 may	 depend	 on	 the	 word	 of	 those	 present,	 this chain	of	hands	remained	unbroken	for	two	hours.	The	room	at	first	was	perfectly</p>
<p class="calibre1">dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"For	 half	 an	 hour	 we	 sat	 at	 ease,	 talking	 a	 little	 now	 and	 then,	 but	 leaving	 the direction	 of	 the	 whole	 affair	 to	 Peters.	 He	 hinted	 to	 us—and	 this	 I	 wish	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>particularly	 emphasize—that	 he	 went	 out	 of	 his	 body.	 He	 said:	 'When	 I	 think toward	any	one	or	toward	a	thing,	I	am	there.	I	am	all	around	it.	If	I	think	toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 person,	 I	 am	 there—all	 around	 him—inside	 of	 him.'	 In	 pursuit	 of	 this	 idea,	 I then	 asked:	 'Are	 you	 conscious	 of	 your	 body	 which	 you	 have	 left	 behind?	 Are you	conscious	of	being	 in	 the	 upper	 part	 of	 the	 room,	 for	 instance,	 and	 do	 you see	your	body	below	you?' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'No,'	said	he;	'I	am	conscious	of	being	in	a	certain	place,	but	I	am	not	conscious of	being	in	two	places	at	the	same	time.'	He	told	us	of	his	development,	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	about	through	attendance	on	a	circle	with	another	psychic.	He	said	he	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	experimenting	for	about	four	years.	I	asked	him	if	it	had	affected	his	health</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	any	way,	and	he	replied:	'No,	it	does	not	weary	me	any	more	than	prolonged</p>
<p class="calibre1">study	might	do.	I	am	very	fond	of	playing	chess,	and	I	find	that	I	do	not	play	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">well	 after	 a	 sitting—that's	 all.'	 He	 said	 the	 only	 sign	 of	 the	 special	 condition which	produced	these	phenomena	was	a	nervous	tremor	in	his	limbs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 first	 evidence	 of	 'the	 force'	 came	 in	 steady	 tappings	 upon	 Mrs.	 Towne's chair.	The	young	man	said:	'This	is	my	friend	"Evans,"'	and	thereupon	I	began	to direct	 the	 sitting	 through	 'Evans.'	 In	 answer	 to	 my	 questions,	 he	 said	 that	 he would	 do	 what	 he	 could	 do	 for	 us.	 I	 asked	 him	 if	 he	 would	 write,	 and	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">answered	by	tapping	that	he	would	try. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shortly	 after	 this	 promise,	 sounds	 as	 of	 hands	 were	 heard	 about	 the	 table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sheets	 of	 paper	 were	 plainly	 being	 written	 upon	 and	 torn	 off	 the	 pad.	 One	 of these	 was	 flourished	 in	 my	 face,	 while	 the	 linked	 fingers	 of	 the	 psychic	 were firmly	held	by	Dr.	Towne	and	his	wife.	All	of	those	in	the	circle	excepting	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Steinert	and	myself	were	new	to	this	business,	and	much	impressed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"At	the	precise	moment	when	these	hands	were	at	work	writing,	and	a	little	later</p>
<p class="calibre1">while	 they	 patted	 Mrs.	 Towne's	 cheek	 and	 tapped	 on	 the	 doctor's	 shirt-front,	 I asked:	'Are	you	controlling	his	hands?' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Yes,'	responded	the	doctor,	who,	by-the-way,	is	a	vigorous	young	scientist	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	never	before	experimented	with	these	forces.	His	reply	was	echoed	by	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Towne,	 who	 remained	 perfectly	 calm	 and	 clear-headed	 throughout	 the	 entire</p>
<p class="calibre1">sitting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thus	far	the	phenomena	were	precisely	similar	to	those	we	have	had	with	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Smiley,	 but	 we	 were	 soon	 to	 have	 proofs	 of	 greater	 power.	 While	 the	 chain	 of hands	 continued	 unbroken,	 mysterious	 fingers	 clutched	 Dr.	 Towne's	 arm	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">drummed	 upon	 his	 shirt-front.	 At	 length	 the	 same	 mystic	 fingers	 began	 to	 take</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>off	his	tie,	and,	while	I	warningly	called	out,	'Be	sure	of	your	psychic's	hands,' </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 doctor's	 collar	 was	 taken	 away	 and	 put	 around	 his	 wife's	 neck.	 His	 tie	 was then	added	to	the	collar.	Mrs.	Towne	announced	that,	while	holding	firmly	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">psychic,	 she	 felt	 the	 touch	 of	  <i class="calibre4">two</i>	 hands	 about	 her	 face,	 and	 a	 few	 moments thereafter	Dr.	Merriam,	seated	next	to	Dr.	Towne,	said	he	felt	a	strong	pressure</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon	his	arm,	as	if	some	one	were	leaning	upon	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	little	later	these	hands	began	to	unbutton	Dr.	Towne's	shirt-front,	and	several</p>
<p class="calibre1">pencils	 were	 stuffed	 inside.	 Hands	 patted	 and	 touched	 those	 who	 sat	 within	 a radius	 of	 about	 a	 yard	 of	 the	 psychic;	 apparently	 the	 forces	 could	 not	 reach	 to where	I	sat.	I	complained	of	this,	and	almost	immediately	the	psychic	said	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	some	one	for	me,	and	in	answer	to	my	question,	'Is	there	some	one	present</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 me?'	 the	 pencil	 rapped	 three	 times	 upon	 the	 table	 in	 the	 affirmative.	 At	 my request	this	'spirit'	wrote	his	name	upon	a	piece	of	paper,	tore	it	off,	and	threw	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 my	 lap.	 A	 moment	 later	 something	 hard	 and	 crackling	 came	 over	 the	 table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'My	cuffs	have	been	removed,'	the	psychic	called	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Having	 in	 mind	 one	 of	 the	 extraordinary	 experiments	 of	 Zöllner,	 I	 then	 asked</p>
<p class="calibre1">'Evans'	to	remove	Dr.	Towne's	vest.	I	said:	'If	we	can	get	that,	it	will	be	in	effect</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	confirmation	of	Zöllner's	theory	of	the	fourth	dimension.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"For	 a	 few	 moments	 hands	 touched	 and	 patted	 Dr.	 Towne	 as	 if	 with	 intent	 to make	 this	 experiment	 but	 gave	 it	 up,	 and	 Peters	 announced	 that	 they	 were	 at work	 around	 him.	 It	 could	 not	 have	 been	 more	 than	 a	 minute	 later	 when	 I	 felt something	soft	thrown	in	my	lap.	I	did	not	know	what	this	was,	and	did	not	care</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 break	 the	 circle	 at	 the	 moment	 to	 find	 out,	 and	 the	 information	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">volunteered	 by	 the	 psychic	 that	 the	 'spirits'	 had	 removed	 his	 vest,	 and	 this	 we afterward	found	to	be	the	case,	for	at	the	close	of	the	sitting	his	vest	was	lying	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	feet." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	come	now,"	said	Miller,	"you	don't	intend	to	convey—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	am	telling	exactly	what	took	place,"	I	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Peters	then	said	to	Dr.	Towne:	'Think	of	some	signature,	not	your	own,	that	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">know	 very	 well,	 and	 I	 will	 reproduce	 it.'	 After	 a	 little	 silence	 the	 sound	 of writing	could	be	heard,	and	the	tap	of	a	pencil	announced	that	its	task	was	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sheet	of	paper	was	then	ripped	from	the	pad,	a	very	definite	action,	as	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">may	believe,	and	the	sound	of	the	sheet	being	folded	was	plainly	heard." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	 would	 require	 a	 thumb	 and	 finger	 and	 afterward	 two	 hands,"	 remarked</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a>Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Precisely;	and	they	were	there,	notwithstanding	the	hands	of	the	psychic	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 felt	 (so	 Dr.	 Towne	 and	 Mrs.	 Towne	 both	 said)	 with	 no	 movement	 but	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">convulsive	quivering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 then	 asked	 'Evans'	 if	 he	 could	 not	 lift	 the	 table	 for	 us,	 and	 he	 replied	 by tapping	 that	 he	 would	 try;	 and	 a	 few	 moments	 later	 the	 psychic,	 whose	 hands and	 feet	 began	 to	 pass	 through	 a	 period	 of	 tremor,	 warningly	 called	 out:	 'Now please	 be	 very	 quiet,	 and	 don't	 break	 the	 circle.'	 I	 could	 hear	 him	 take	 a	 deep breath,	and	a	moment	later	the	table	rose	and	passed	over	Mrs.	Towne's	head	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">closely	that	she	was	obliged	to	lean	to	the	right	to	avoid	it,	and	we	all	heard	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">gently	deposited	not	far	from	the	psychic's	right	hand.	While	this	was	done,	both</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Towne	and	Mrs.	Towne	affirmed	that	their	fingers	were	locked	with	those	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	psychic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Here,	 again,	 was	 a	 phenomenon,	 inconclusive	 in	 itself,	 from	 the	 fact	 that	 we could	not	see	the	table	move,	and	yet	which	coheres	with	an	immense	body	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">inexplicable	similar	movements	in	the	reports	of	Flammarion	and	Lombroso.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	impossible	for	the	medium	to	lift	this	weight	over	Mrs.	Towne's	head,	even</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	his	right	arm	had	been	completely	free,	for	the	stand,	though	small,	was	heavy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	regarded	this,	at	the	moment,	as	an	authentic	case	of	telekinesis,	and	my	further</p>
<p class="calibre1">experience	with	this	psychic	has	not	weakened	that	conviction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shortly	after	this	the	psychic	broke	up	the	circle,	saying	that,	as	conditions	were favorable,	he	would	try	to	produce	materialized	forms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Taking	 the	 chair	 which	 was	 occupied	 by	 Mrs.	 Steinert,	 he	 withdrew	 into	 the passage-way	leading	to	the	dining-room,	requesting	that	the	circle	resolve	itself</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	a	half-circle	facing	the	cabinet.	You	will	remember	that	we	were	in	a	private</p>
<p class="calibre1">house,	and	that	all	question	of	collusion	is	barred	out.	Shortly	after	he	took	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">seat	in	this	little	recess,	two	or	three	brilliant	lights,	like	the	twisting	flame	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">small	candle—a	curious,	glowing,	yet	not	radiant	violet	flame—developed,	high</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	 on	 the	 outside	 of	 the	 portières	 which	 formed	 the	 cabinet,	 and	 drifted	 across and	up	toward	the	ceiling,	where	they	silently	vanished.	I	think	there	must	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 three	 of	 these,	 which	 were	 followed	 by	 a	 broad,	 glowing	 mass	 of	 what</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	like	white-hot	metal—a	singular	light,	unlike	anything	I	had	ever	seen.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">made	 me	 think	 of	 the	 substance	 described	 by	 Sir	 William	 Crookes	 and	 other</p>
<p class="calibre1">experimenters	abroad.	At	the	moment	this	appeared—or	possibly	a	little	before	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">—a	 wild	 whoop	 was	 heard—very	 startling	 indeed,	 as	 if	 a	 door	 had	 suddenly</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a>been	 opened	 by	 a	 roguish	 boy	 and	 closed	 again.	 This	 practically	 ended	 the séance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As	we	lighted	up	I	had	first	interest	for	the	object	which	had	been	thrown	across</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	me.	It	proved	to	be	a	vest,	which	the	psychic	said	was	his.	It	was	a	soft	gray</p>
<p class="calibre1">vest,	and	matched	his	suit,	and	was	without	any	trick	seams—so	far	as	I	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">see—being	whole	and	uninjured.	In	the	inside	pocket	a	folded	leaf	of	the	paper</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 the	 pad	 was	 stuffed,	 and	 on	 this	 was	 the	 signature	 'Alfred	 Towne,'	 which Dr.	 Towne	 said	 was	 an	 exact	 reproduction	 of	 his	 brother's	 autograph.	 On	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sheet	of	paper	which	had	been	thrown	to	me	was	the	simple	word	'Taft.'	This	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">taken	 by	 the	 circle	 to	 be	 a	 prophecy	 on	 the	 election,	 but,	 as	 my	 wife's	 family name	 is	 Taft,	 I	 put	 a	 different	 interpretation	 upon	 it.	 On	 the	 whole,	 the	 sitting made	 a	 profound	 impression	 upon	 me.	 It	 was	 not	 so	 much	 one	 thing	 as	 many</p>
<p class="calibre1">things,	 all	 cohering	 with	 what	 I	 already	 knew	 of	 telekinetic	 phenomena.	 It	 was not	a	test	sitting,	as	Peters	acknowledged,	but	it	was	by	no	means	easy	to	deceive</p>
<p class="calibre1">under	the	control	we	exercised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	 were	 many	 things	 of	 interest	 aside	 from	 the	 physical	 happenings.	 The young	man	did	not	go	into	a	trance,	but	remained	perfectly	normal.	He	took	part</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 conversation,	 answered	 all	 questions,	 and	 lent	 himself	 perfectly	 to	 the experiment.	 He	 said	 that	 if	 we	 would	 sit	 with	 him	 again	 he	 was	 sure	 we	 could have	more	light.	'I	don't	care	to	be	known	as	a	medium,'	he	declared.	'I	like	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">study	 of	 law,	 and	 I	 want	 to	 be	 a	 lawyer—not	 a	 sensitive.	 In	 the	 first	 place,	 the law	pays	better,	and,	in	the	second	place,	it	isn't	considered	a	nice	thing	to	be	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">medium.	However,	I	will	sit	again	for	you,	if	you	want	me	to,	and	I	am	sure	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	get	many	other	things	in	the	light.'	And	he	added	to	me	later:	'We	can	get	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	 phenomena	 with	 no	 one	 present	 but	 ourselves.	 Come	 down	 to	 my	 home</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	evening	and	we	will	try	again.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did	you	accept	his	invitation?"	asked	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes;	but	before	I	did	so	we	had	another	sitting	at	Dr.	Towne's	house,	which	gave</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	a	closer	view	of	all	that	went	on,	for	I	was	permitted	to	sit	at	his	left	and	grip</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	little	finger.	The	circle	was	slightly	changed	the	next	time,	and	on	his	right</p>
<p class="calibre1">sat	 a	 young	 lady	 whom	 we	 will	 call	 Miss	 Brown.	 She	 was	 a	 wide-awake	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	 unexcitable	 person,	 and	 I	 believe	 kept	 close	 hold	 on	 the	 psychic's	 right hand.	In	addition	to	our	linked	fingers,	the	psychic's	hands	were	tied	to	ours	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">dental	floss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	was	considerable	light	in	the	room	this	time,	and	as	the	nervous	tremor</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a>developed	in	the	psychic's	hands	and	legs	I	imagined	I	could	see	a	grayish	vapor form	 just	 between	 and	 a	 little	 above	 our	 clasped	 hands.	 Suddenly	 I	 saw	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">shadowy	arm	dart	forth	from	the	cloud,	and	I	felt	the	clasp	of	a	firm	hand	on	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrist.	It	was	a	right	hand.	'Are	you	controlling	the	psychic's	hand?'	I	demanded</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	Miss	Brown.	'Yes,'	she	replied,	alertly.	Even	as	I	spoke	I	saw	the	mysterious</p>
<p class="calibre1">limb	dart	out	and	seize	upon	a	pencil	which	lay	upon	the	table.	Again	and	again	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">saw	this	'apparition'	emerge	from	that	vaporous	cloud	and	handle	the	pad	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">middle	 of	 the	 table.	 I	 could	 see	 three	 fingers	 on	 the	 under-side	 of	 the	 pad	 as	 it was	 held	 before	 the	 psychic's	 face,	 and	 these	 facts	 I	 announced	 to	 the	 other members	 of	 the	 circle,	 who	 could	 not	 see	 as	 plainly	 as	 I	 could.	 Sometimes	 the arm	seemed	white,	sometimes	black,	and	always	it	appeared	to	be	a	right	hand." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	 is	 to	 say,  <i class="calibre4">your</i>	 control	 was	 more	 vigorous	 than	 that	 of	 Miss	 Brown," </p>
<p class="calibre1">remarked	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	 doubter	 might	 say	 so,	 and	 yet	 the	 thread	 which	 bound	 us	 had	 some	 value. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	 of	 the	 most	 extraordinary	 performances	 was	 the	 lifting	 of	 a	 glass	 of	 water which	set	in	the	centre	of	the	table.	I	could	see	the	glass	plainly	as	it	rose	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">psychic's	 lips.	 It	 seemed	 to	 be	 sustained	 by	 a	 broad	 beam	 of	 vapor,	 or	 it	 may have	been	a	slim	arm	clothed	in	white." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Probably	the	psychic's." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Possibly;	but	I	don't	see	how	it	could	have	been.	However,	I	do	not	place	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	 value	 upon	 it	 as	 standing	 alone,	 but	 considered	 in	 connection	 with	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">performances	of	Eusapia,	it	becomes	a	little	more	nearly	credible." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	 all	 this	 is	 very	 far	 from	 being	 an	 evidence	 of	 anything	 like	 intelligence," </p>
<p class="calibre1">protested	Fowler.	"It	seems	very	trivial	to	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	does	not	seem	trivial	to	me,"	I	answered;	"but	I	will	admit	that	is	has	nothing like	 the	 value	 of	 a	 series	 of	 sittings	 I	 held	 last	 spring	 with	 a	 psychic	 in	 a	 mid-Western	city." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a><b class="calibre3">IX</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 reader	 will	 have	 observed	 that	 up	 to	 the	 present	 moment	 I	 have	 not</p>
<p class="calibre1">emphasized	 in	 any	 way	 the	 question	 of	 the	 identity	 of	 the	 "intelligences"	 that have	 manifested	 themselves.	 The	 reason	 for	 this	 lies	 in	 the	 fact	 that	 I	 was	 still seeking	 evidence	 concerning	 the	 processes	 of	 mediumship.	 However,	 being</p>
<p class="calibre1">convinced	(by	reason	of	my	own	experiments,	supported	by	those	of	Lombroso, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morselli,	 and	 Bottazzi)	 that	 the	 facts	 of	 mediumship	 exist,	 it	 is	 my	 purpose	 to take	 up	 definitely	 the	 question	 of	 identity,	 which	 is	 the	 final	 and	 most	 elusive part	of	the	problem—it	may	turn	out	to	be	the	insoluble	part	of	the	problem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	you	ask	why	it	should	be	insoluble,	I	reply,	because	it	concerns	the	mystery	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">death,	and	it	may	be	that	it	is	not	well	for	us	to	penetrate	the	ultimate	shadow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among	all	the	men	of	the	highest	rank	who	admit	the	reality	of	apparitions	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">voices,	there	are	but	few	as	yet	who	are	willing	to	assert	that	the	dead	manifest</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves.	By	this	I	mean	that	though	some	of	them,	like	Crookes,	for	example, </p>
<p class="calibre1">believe	 in	 "the	 intervention	 of	 discarnate	 intelligences,"	 they	 are	 not	 ready	 to grant	that	these	intelligences	are	their	grandfathers	returning	to	the	scene	of	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">earthly	labors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 said	 something	 like	 this	 to	 Miller	 and	 Fowler,	 when	 we	 met	 at	 the	 club	 one afternoon	 not	 long	 after	 the	 final	 meeting	 of	 Cameron's	 Amateur	 Psychical</p>
<p class="calibre1">Society,	and	I	added:	"I	must	confess	that	most	of	the	spirits	I	have	met	seem	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	 merely	 parasitic	 or	 secondary	 personalities	 (to	 use	 Maxwell's	 term),	 drawn</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 the	 psychic	 or	 from	 myself.	 Nearly	 every	 one	 of	 the	 mediums	 I	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">studied	 has	 had	 at	 least	 one	 guide,	 whose	 voice	 and	 habit	 of	 thought	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">perilously	similar	to	her	own.	This,	in	some	cases,	has	been	laughable,	as	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">'Rolling	 Thunder,'	 a	 Sioux	 chief	 (Indians	 are	 all	 chiefs	 in	 the	 spirit	 world), appears	 and	 says:	 'Goot	 efening,	 friends;	 id	 iss	 a	 nice	 night	 alretty.'	 And	 yet	 I have	 seen	 a	 whole	 roomful	 of	 people	 receive	 communications	 from	 a	 spirit	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	 kind	 with	 solemn	 awe.	 I	 burn	 with	 shame	 for	 the	 sitters	 and	 psychic	 when this	kind	of	thing	is	going	on." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	visit	the	wrong	mediums,"	said	Fowler.	"Such	psychics	are	on	a	low	plane. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	never	go	to	those	who	associate	with	Indians." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	mediums	are	all	alike	in	this	respect.	I	don't	suppose	Mrs.	Smiley	realizes</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a>that	'Maudie'	would	be	called	by	a	doubter	a	falsetto	disguise	of	her	own	voice, and	'Wilbur'	a	shrewd	and	humorous	personification	of	her	subconscious	self;	or, </p>
<p class="calibre1">if	she	does,	she	probably	ascribes	it	to	the	process	of	materialization	which	'takes</p>
<p class="calibre1">from'	 the	 medium.	 Never	 but	 once	 have	 I	 had	 the	 sensation	 of	 being	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">presence	 of	 a	 real	 spirit	 personality,	 and	 that	 happened	 to	 me	 only	 a	 few	 days ago." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	 must	 have	 been	 an	 extraordinary	 experience	 to	 have	 made	 so	 deep	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">impression	upon	you,"	said	Fowler. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	 it	 was	 extraordinary.	 It	 had	 the	 personal	 element	 in	 it	 to	 a	 much	 greater degree	 than	 any	 case	 I	 had	 hitherto	 studied,	 and	 seemed	 a	 direct	 attempt	 at identification	 on	 the	 part	 of	 a	 powerful	 and	 original	 individuality	 but	 recently</p>
<p class="calibre1">'passed	out.'	It	came	about	in	this	way:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	met,	not	long	ago,	at	the	home	of	a	friend	in	a	Western	city,	a	woman	who	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	to	be	able	to	produce	whispers	independent	of	her	own	organs	of	speech.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	assured	by	those	in	whom	I	had	confidence	that	these	voices	could	be	heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	broad	light	of	day,	in	the	open	air,	anywhere	the	psychic	happened	to	be, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 that	 her	 'work'	 was	 of	 an	 exceptionally	 high	 character.	 I	 was	 keenly</p>
<p class="calibre1">interested,	as	you	may	imagine,	and	asked	for	a	sitting.	Mrs.	Hartley,	as	we	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">call	 her,	 fixed	 a	 day	 and	 hour	 in	 her	 own	 house	 for	 the	 trial,	 and	 I	 went	 to	 the sitting	a	few	days	later	with	high	expectations	of	her	'phase.'	I	found	her	living	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 small	 frame	 house	 on	 a	 pleasant	 street,	 with	 nothing	 to	 indicate	 that	 it	 was	 a meeting-place	of	mortals	and	their	'spirit	guides.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mrs.	 Hartley	 was	 quite	 evidently	 a	 woman	 of	 power	 and	 native	 intelligence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	few	minutes	of	general	conversation	she	took	me	up	to	her	study	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">second	floor,	a	sunny	little	den	on	the	east	side	of	the	house,	which	was	not	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	least	suggestive	of	hocus-pocus.	A	broad	mission	table,	two	bookcases,	a	few</p>
<p class="calibre1">flowers,	and	a	curious	battered	old	black	walnut	table	completed	the	furnishing</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 room,	 which	 indicated	 something	 rather	 studious	 and	 thoughtful	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">owner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mrs.	Hartley	asked	me	to	be	seated,	and	added,	'Please	write	on	a	sheet	of	paper</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	names	of	such	friends	as	you	would	like	to	communicate	with.'	She	then	left</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	room	on	some	household	errand,	and	while	she	was	gone	I	wrote	the	name	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 guide,	 'Dr.	 Cooke'	 (out	 of	 compliment),	 and	 added	 that	 of	 a	 musical	 friend whom	I	will	call	'Ernest	Alexander.'	I	also	wrote	the	names	'Jessie'	and	'David,' </p>
<p class="calibre1">folded	 the	 sheet	 once,	 and	 retained	 it	 under	 my	 hand.	 Upon	 her	 return	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a>psychic	seated	herself	at	the	battered	oval	table,	and,	taking	up	a	pair	of	hinged school	 slates,	 began	 to	 clean	 them	 with	 a	 cloth.	 I	 am	 not	 going	 to	 detail	 my precautions.	 You	 must	 take	 my	 detective	 work	 for	 granted.	 Moreover,	 in	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1">case	 I	 was	 awaiting	 the	 voices;	 the	 slate-writing	 was	 gratuitous.	 She	 took	 the slates	 (between	 which	 I	 had	 dropped	 my	 slip	 of	 paper),	 and,	 putting	 them</p>
<p class="calibre1">beneath	the	table,	asked	me	to	hold	one	corner." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	  <i class="calibre4">wish</i>	 they	 wouldn't	 do	 that,"	 protested	 Fowler.	 "It	 isn't	 necessary.	 I've	 had messages	on	slates	held	in	my	own	hands	six	feet	from	the	psychic." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As	 we	 sat	 thus	 she	 told	 me	 that	 she	 had	 never	 been	 in	 a	 trance,	 and	 that	 she never	permitted	the	dark.	'I	force	my	guides	to	work	in	the	light,'	she	said.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">declared	 that	 the	 whispers	 which	 I	 was	 presently	 to	 hear	 came	 to	 her	 under	 all conditions,	and	that	her	spirit	friends	talked	to	her	familiarly	as	she	went	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	household	duties.	She	assured	me	that	'they'	were	a	great	help	and	comfort	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">her.	 'Dr.	 Cooke'	 was	 her	 ever-present	 guide	 and	 counsellor,	 and	 her	 father	 and brother	were	always	near. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	was	plain	that	she	did	not	stand	in	awe	of	them,	for	after	half	an	hour's	wait</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	grew	impatient	and	called	out	in	an	imperious	tone:	'Come,	dear,	I	want	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Come,	 anybody.'	 Two	 or	 three	 times	 she	 spoke	 loudly,	 clearly,	 as	 if	 calling	 to some	 one	 through	 a	 thick	 wall.	 This	 interested	 me	 exceedingly.	 Generally</p>
<p class="calibre1">psychics	 are	 very	 humble	 and	 patient	 with	 their	 'guides.'	 A	 few	 moments	 later the	 slates	 began	 to	 slam	 about	 so	 violently	 beneath	 the	 table	 that	 her	 arm	 was bruised,	and	she	protested	sharply:	'Don't	do	that.	You	will	break	the	slates	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 table	 both!'	 Thereupon	 the	 'forces'	 quieted	 down	 till	 only	 a	 peculiar	 quiver remained	in	them.	I	could	hear	writing	going	on	steadily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"At	 last	 a	 tap	 came	 to	 announce	 that	 the	 messages	 were	 written.	 The	 psychic withdrew	the	slates	and	handed	them	across	the	table	to	me.	I	opened	them	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">took	out	my	paper.	On	one	slate	was	a	message	from	'Dr.	Cooke,'	the	guide;	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 other	 were	 these	 words,	 written	 in	 slate-pencil:	 '  <i class="calibre4">I	 would	 that	 you	 could	 see</i> <i class="calibre4">me	as	I	am	now,	still	occupied,	and	happy	to	be	busy. </i>'	This	was	followed	by	four lines	and	three	little	marks,	evidently	intended	to	symbolize	a	bar	of	music,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	whole	was	signed,	'E.	Alexander.'	The	writing	was	firm	and	manly,	but	I	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	recognize	it	as	that	of	my	friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 second	 trial	 resulted	 in	 this	 vague	 communication:	 '  <i class="calibre4">My	 dear	 friend,	 don't</i> <i class="calibre4">overdo.	Earth	is	but	one	life.	Many	I	recall.	I	tried	to	give	expression	to	my	one</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">talent. </i>'	This	was	signed	'Ernest	Alexander.'	Both	these	replies,	as	you	see,	were</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a>very	general	in	phraseology,	but	the	third	message	came	closer	to	the	individual:</p>
<p class="calibre1">'  <i class="calibre4">I	 was	 so	 tired	 and	 not	 myself.	 I	 am	 well	 and	 in	 the	 world	 of	 progress.	 Ernest</i> <i class="calibre4">Alexander. </i>'	The	bar	of	music	again	appeared,	this	time	much	more	'developed.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller	stopped	me	here.	"All	this	is	quite	simple.	Mrs.	Hartley	opened	and	read</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	note	and,	following	up	the	clew,	simply	did	some	neat	trick-writing	beneath</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	table." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	is	not	so	simple	as	all	that,"	I	answered.	"She	was	interrupted	about	this	time by	 the	 doorbell,	 and	 while	 she	 was	 gone	 I	 wrote	 on	 another	 piece	 of	 paper:</p>
<p class="calibre1">'Ernest,	give	me	a	test	of	your	identity.	Write	a	bar	from	the	"——	Sonata."'	This note	I	folded	close	and	put	in	an	inside	pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In	 answer	 to	 this	 request,	 when	 the	 medium	 returned	 I	 got	 these	 pertinent words:	'  <i class="calibre4">I	was	not	a	disappointment	to	myself,	but	I	was	at	a	point	where	nerve</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">force	 failed	 me. </i>'	 This	 was	 signed	 '  <i class="calibre4">Ernest</i>,'	 and	 was	 accompanied	 by	 another sketchy	 bar	 of	 music.	 It	 all	 looked	 like	 a	 real	 attempt	 to	 give	 me	 what	 I	 had asked	 for,	 and	 yet	 it	 was	 the	 kind	 of	 reply	 that	 might	 have	 been	 made	 by	 the medium	had	she	known	the	history	of	my	musical	friend,	or	had	she	been	able	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">take	it	out	of	my	mind." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even	that	is	a	violent	assumption	to	me,"	remarked	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	it	is	to	me,"	I	answered.	"I	can't	really	believe	in	thought	transmission,	and yet—	I	then	asked	for	the	signature	of	the	staff,	and	a	small	'  <i class="calibre4">c</i>'	was	written	in	the bar	above,	and	another	bar	was	added.	Now	on	the	slates	there	came	(with	every</p>
<p class="calibre1">evidence	 of	 eager	 haste)	 intimate	 questions	 concerning	 Alexander's	 family:	 '  <i class="calibre4">Is</i> <i class="calibre4">my	wife	cared	for? </i>'	and	the	like.	To	these	I	replied	orally.	I	must	tell	you	that	all along	 the	 whisper	 spoke	 of	 Alexander's	 wife	 as	 'Mary,'	 which	 was	 wrong, </p>
<p class="calibre1">although	it	was	close	to	the	actual	name.	Also,	after	I	began	to	speak	of	him	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">'E.	A.'	the	messages	were	all	signed	in	that	manner,	all	of	which	would	seem	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">argue	a	little	confusion	in	the	psychic's	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	little	later,  <i class="calibre4">while	I	held	the	slate	myself</i>,	the	mysterious	'force'	wrote,	'  <i class="calibre4">I	thank</i> <i class="calibre4">you	 for	 what	 you	 have	 done.	 I	 have	 been	 told	 my	 mind	 is	 clear</i>,'	 which	 was particularly	 full	 of	 meaning	 to	 me,	 for	 the	 reason	 that	 my	 friend's	 mind	 was clouded	toward	the	close	of	his	life." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	 of	 which	 proves	 nothing,"	 insisted	 Miller.	 "Your	 friend,	 if	 I	 conjecture rightly,	 was	 a	 well-known	 man,	 and	 the	 psychic	 could	 have	 read,	 and	 probably did	read,	all	about	his	illness	in	the	public	press." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a>"It	may	be	so.	About	this	time	I	began	to	hear	a	faint	whisper,	which	 <i class="calibre4">seemed</i>	to come	from	 a	 point	a	 little	 to	the	 right	 of	 and	a	 foot	 or	two	 above	 the	psychic's lips.	 This,	 she	 informed	 me,	 was	 the	 voice	 of	 'Dr.	 Cooke,'	 her	 guide.	 I	 could catch	only	a	few	of	the	whispered	words,	and	Mrs.	Hartley	was	forced	to	repeat</p>
<p class="calibre1">them.	 'Dr.	 Cooke,'	 thus	 interpreted,	 said:	 '  <i class="calibre4">Your	friend	Alexander	is	present,	and</i> <i class="calibre4">overjoyed	to	talk	with	you. </i>'	The	conversation	went	on	with	both	'Dr.	Cooke'	and the	psychic	standing	between	the	alleged	spirit	and	myself;	but	even	then	I	must</p>
<p class="calibre1">admit	that	'Alexander's'	queries	and	answers	were	to	the	point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Under	 what	 seemed	 like	 test	 conditions	 I	 got	 two	 more	 bars	 of	 music,	 both much	 more	 definitive	 in	 form	 than	 the	 others;	 and	 these,	 the	 whisper	 declared, were	 from	 the	 third	 movement	 of	 the	 '——	 Sonata.'	 This	 message	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">accompanied	by	a	curious	little	device	like	the	letter	 <i class="calibre4">C</i>	with	a	line	drawn	through it,	and	I	said	to	myself:	'If	this	should	prove	to	be	a	mark	which	"Ernest"	used	in signing	 his	 manuscript,	 something	 like	 Whistler's	 butterfly,	 I	 shall	 have	 a	 fine test	of	thought	transmission.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	now	secured	under	excellent	tests	the	writing	of	a	singular	word,	which	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">plainly	spelled	but	meant	nothing	to	me.	It	looked	like	'  <i class="calibre4">Isinghere</i>.'	In	answer	to oral	 questioning,	 the	 whisper	 said	 that	 these	 bars	 of	 music	 were	 part	 of	 an unpublished	 manuscript,	 a	 fragment,	 which	 the	 composer	 had	 meant	 to	 call</p>
<p class="calibre1">'Isinghere.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	 about	 the	 process?"	 asked	 Miller.	 "Did	 the	 writing	 appear	 to	 be supernormal?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	and	so	did	the	whispering.	I	could	detect	no	connection	between	the	lips	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	psychic	and	the	voice.	In	one	way	or	another	I	varied	the	conditions,	so	that	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	at	last	quite	convinced	of	the	psychic's	supernormal	power;	but	that	was	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	quest.	I	was	seeking	proof	of	the	identity	of	my	friend	'E.	A.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Seeing	that	the	chief	means	of	identification	might	be	in	the	music,	I	persuaded</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	friend	Blake,	who	is	a	fairly	competent	musician,	to	sit	with	me	and	decipher</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 score	 which	 'E.	 A.'	 persisted	 in	 setting	 down.	 I	 was	 now	 eager	 to	 secure	 a complete	 phrase	 of	 the	 music.	 I	 saw	 myself	 establishing,	 at	 the	 least,	 the	 most beautiful	 case	 of	 mind-tapping	 on	 record.	 'If	 we	 can	 secure	 the	 score	 of	 an unpublished	 manuscript	 of	 Alexander's	 composition	 we	 shall	 have	 worked	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">miracle,'	I	said	to	Blake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Our	first	sitting,	which	took	place	in	the	home	of	a	common	friend,	was	mixed</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 to	 results;	 but	 the	 second,	 which	 we	 held	 in	 Mrs.	 Hartley's	 study	 one	 bright</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a>morning,	was	very	fruitful.	The	'powers'	started	in	at	once	as	if	to	confound	us both.	 Blake	 received	 a	 message	 written	 on	 a	 slate	 under	 his	 foot,	 and	 I	 got	 the name	 '  <i class="calibre4">Jessie</i>,'	 with	 the	 word	 '  <i class="calibre4">sister</i>'	 written	 beneath	 it;	 and	 then	 suddenly	 the whispers	changed	in	character.	The	words	became	swift,	impetuous,	imperious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'  <i class="calibre4">Line	off	all	the	leaves	of	a	slate</i>,'	the	voice	commanded.	I	understood	at	once,	for in	the	previous	sitting	'E.	A.'	had	seemingly	found	it	difficult	to	draw	a	long	line. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a>"We	 had	 brought	 some	 silicon	 slates	 of	 the	 book	 variety,	 and	 Blake	 now proceeded	 to	 rule	 one	 of	 them	 with	 the	 lines	 of	 a	 musical	 staff,	 and	 on	 these slates,	 held	 as	 before	 beneath	 the	 table,	 we	 began	 to	 get	 bars	 of	 music	 of	 a character	 quite	 outside	 the	 knowledge	 of	 the	 psychic	 and	 myself;	 and,	 more</p>
<p class="calibre1">remarkable	still,	the	whispers,	so	the	psychic	informed	us,	were	no	longer	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">'Dr.	Cooke';	'E.	A.,'	she	declared,	was	there	in	person	and	directing	the	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Furthermore,	 the	 requests	 that	 we	 now	 received	 were	 entirely	 different	 in character	 from	 'Cooke's'	 impersonal	 remarks.	 The	 whispers	 were	 quick	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">masterful,	 wonderfully	 like	 'Alexander'	 in	 content.	 'He'	 was	 humorous;	 'he' </p>
<p class="calibre1">acknowledged	mistakes	in	the	score,	calling	them	'  <i class="calibre4">slips	of	the	pen</i>.'	'He'	became highly	technical	in	 his	conversation	with	 Blake,	talking	of	 musical	matters	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	Greek	to	me	and,	I	venture	to	say,	Coptic	to	the	psychic.	'He'	corrected	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">notations	himself,	sometimes	when	Blake	held	the	slate,	sometimes	when	I	held</p>
<p class="calibre1">it.	Part	of	the	time	'he'	indicated	the	corrections	orally.	'He'	asked	Blake	to	try	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"At	 last	 'he'	 broke	 off,	 and	 imperiously	 said:	 '  <i class="calibre4">Take	 the	 table	 to	 the	 piano. </i>'	 This seemed	 to	 surprise	 the	 psychic,	 but	 she	 acquiesced,	 and	 we	 moved	 the	 small</p>
<p class="calibre1">stand	and	our	slates	down	to	the	little	parlor;	and	there,	with	Blake	now	holding</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	slate	beneath	the	table	and	now	playing	the	notes	upon	the	piano,	the	score</p>
<p class="calibre1">grew	into	a	weird	little	melody	with	bass	accompaniment,	which	seemed	to	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 the	 moment	 exactly	 like	 a	 message	 from	 my	 friend	 Alexander.	 The	 first	 bar went	through	me	like	the	sound	of	his	voice." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now	 you	 are	 getting	 into	 the	 upper	 air	 of	 spiritualism,"	 exulted	 Fowler.	 "You are	now	receiving	a	message	that	has	dignity	and	meaning." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	 it	 seemed	 at	 the	 moment,	 both	 to	 Blake	 and	 to	 myself.	 The	 music	 was manifestly	 not	 the	 kind	 of	 thing	 that	 Mrs.	 Hartley	 could	 conceive.	 It	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">absolutely	  <i class="calibre4">not</i>	 commonplace.	 It	 was	 elliptical,	 touched	 with	 technical	 subtlety, although	 simple	 in	 appearance.	 At	 last	 a	 complete	 phrase	 was	 written	 out	 and partly	harmonized.	This,	'E.	A.'	said,	was	the	beginning	of	a	little	piece	that	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	intended	to	call	'Unghere'	or	'Hungarie.'	Nothing	in	all	my	long	experience</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	psychics	ever	moved	me	like	the	first	phrase	of	that	sweet,	sad	melody.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	like	the	touch	of	identification	I	had	been	seeking." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	 your	 friend	 Blake	 was	 a	 musician,"	 interrupted	 Miller.	 "And	 how	 about your	own	subconscious	self?	You	are	musical,	and	your	mind	is	filled	with	your</p>
<p class="calibre1">friend	Alexander's	music." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a>"That	is	true,	and	I	had	that	reservation	all	along.	'E.	A.'	may	have	been	made	up of	our	combined	subconscious	selves;	I	admit	all	that.	But	no	matter;	it	was	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	marvellous,	even	on	its	material	side,	for	some	of	this	music	was	written	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">while	 the	 slates	 were	 in	 Blake's	 entire	 control.	 At	 times	 he	 not	 merely	 inserted them	 himself	 but	 withdrew	 them—the	 psychic	 merely	 clutched	 one	 corner	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">them.	 Furthermore,	 throughout	 all	 this	 composition	 'Ernest'	 was	 master	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">situation.	 'Dr.	 Cooke'	 was	 superseded.	 There	 was	 neither	 feebleness	 nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">hesitation	 in	 the	 voice.	 I	 could	 now	 distinguish	 most	 of	 the	 words,	 and	 the dialogue	 went	 forward	 exactly	 as	 if	 a	 master	 musician	 were	 dictating	 to	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">intelligent	amanuensis	a	new	and	subtle	sketch." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did	the	medium	look	at	the	music?"	asked	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	now	and	then.	However,	most	of	the	corrections	were	put	in	upside	down, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 regards	 her	 position,	 and	 during	 the	 last	 sitting	 she	 appeared	 to	 be	 no	 more than	a	mere	on-looker.	Once	as	we	sat	holding	the	slate	'Ernest'	whispered	to	me:</p>
<p class="calibre1">'  <i class="calibre4">Blake	is	a	fine	fellow.	I	met	him	twice. </i>'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Can	you	tell	me	where?'	asked	Blake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'  <i class="calibre4">It	 was	 in	 New	 York	 City</i>,'	 was	 the	 reply;	 then,	 after	 a	 moment's	 hesitation:	 '  <i class="calibre4">It</i> <i class="calibre4">was	 at	 dinner—both	 times! </i>'	 'You	 are	 right,'	 said	 Blake,	 much	 impressed.	 'Can you	tell	me	the	places?'	'  <i class="calibre4">Once	was	on	Fifth	Avenue.	The	other	was—I	can't	tell</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">the	location	exactly;	but	it	was	where	we	went	down	a	short	flight	of	steps. </i>'	'That is	correct	also,'	said	Blake.	'How	many	persons	were	there?'	'  <i class="calibre4">Five. </i>'	'Quite	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Can	you	tell	me	who	they	were?'	'  <i class="calibre4">Well,	Mary	was	there,	and	you,	of	course;	but	I</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">can't	be	sure	of	the	others. </i>' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Blake	looked	at	me	in	astonishment,	and	our	minds	flashed	along	the	same	line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suppose	 the	 whisper	 were	 only	 a	 bit	 of	 clever	 ventriloquism,	 how	 did	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">psychic	secure	the	information	conveyed	in	this	dialogue?	It	was	given	as	I	write</p>
<p class="calibre1">it,	with	only	a	bit	of	hesitation	once	or	twice;	and	yet,	it	may	have	been	merely</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought	transference." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">Merely</i>	 thought	 transference!"	 exclaimed	 Miller.	 "I	 consider	 thought transference	quite	as	absurd	as	slate-writing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fowler	 interposed.	 "I	 consider	 this	 a	 simple	 case	 of	 spirit	 communication.	 You should	be	grateful	for	such	a	beautiful	response." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This	significant	fact	is	not	to	be	overlooked,"	I	resumed:	"the	psychic	secured</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a>almost	nothing	else	that	concerned	either	Blake's	affairs	or	my	own.	Mainly	the whispers	had	to	do	with	'E.	A.,'	which,	of	course,	bears	out	Miller's	notion	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 psychic	 could	 deal	 only	 with	 what	 was	 public	 property,	 and	 yet	 this	 little colloquy	 about	 the	 dinners	 in	 New	 York	 is	 very	 convincing	 so	 far	 as	 mind-reading	goes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"During	 the	 third	 sitting,	 Blake	 again	 being	 present,	 'E.	 A.'	 took	 control,	 as before,	from	the	start,	and	carried	forward	the	recording	of	the	musical	fragment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'  <i class="calibre4">I	want	you	to	fill	in	the	treble,	Blake</i>,'	he	said.	'  <i class="calibre4">It's	nothing	but	the	bare	melody</i> <i class="calibre4">now. </i>'	Blake	protested:	'I'm	not	up	to	this.'	And	the	whisper	came	swiftly,	'  <i class="calibre4">You're</i> <i class="calibre4">too	 modest,	 Blake</i>';	 and	 a	 moment	 later	 it	 said:	 '  <i class="calibre4">I	 hope	 you're	 not	 bored,</i> <i class="calibre4">Garland. </i>'	If	all	this	was	a	little	play	of	the	psychic's	devising	it	was	very	clever, for	after	a	few	minutes	of	close	attention	to	Blake,	'E.	A.'	turned	toward	me	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">asked,	with	anxious	haste:	'  <i class="calibre4">Where's	Garland? </i>'	'I	am	here,'	I	answered.	'  <i class="calibre4">Don't	go</i> <i class="calibre4">away</i>,'	he	entreated.	It	was	as	if	for	the	moment	he	had	lost	sight	of	me	by	reason of	fixing	his	attention	upon	Blake." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	 is	 singular!"	 exclaimed	 Fowler.	 "Their	 field	 of	 vision	 is	 evidently	 much more	restricted	than	we	thought." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	must	be	very	small	indeed,	for	Blake	and	I	sat	touching	elbows.	Two	or	three</p>
<p class="calibre1">times	the	whispering	voice	called,	'  <i class="calibre4">Is	Garland	here? </i>'	and	once	it	asked:	'  <i class="calibre4">What	is</i> <i class="calibre4">Garland	 doing?	 I	 see	 his	 hand	 moving. </i>'	 I	 explained	 that	 I	 was	 making	 notes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'  <i class="calibre4">Don't	do	it! </i>'	was	the	agitated	request." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	very	neat	little	touch,"	remarked	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	worked	for	a	long	time	over	this	music,	directed	by	the	voice,	both	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">notation	and	in	the	execution	of	it.	The	lines	were	drawn	for	both	bass	and	treble</p>
<p class="calibre1">lengthwise	 of	 the	 slate,	 and	 Blake	 found	 the	 little	 piece	 difficult	 to	 play,	 partly because	 the	 staves	 were	 on	 different	 leaves	 of	 the	 slate	 and	 partly	 because	 the notes,	 especially	 some	 of	 those	 put	 in	 at	 the	 beginning	 by	 the	 composer,	 were becoming	 blurred.	 It	 was	 marvellous	 to	 see	 how	 exactly	 these	 dim	 notes	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">touched	 up	 by	 the	 mysterious	 pencil	 beneath	 the	 table.	 But	 our	 progress	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">slow.	'E.	A.'	was	very	patient,	though	now	and	then	he	plumply	opposed	his	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	Blake's.	Once,	especially,	Blake	exclaimed:	'That	can't	be	right!' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'  <i class="calibre4">Yes,	it	is	right! </i>'	insisted	'E.	A.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'But	 it	 is	 very	 unusual	 to	 construct	 a	 measure	 in	 that	 way.'	 For	 there	 was	 a seeming	confusion	of	three-four	time	with	six-eight	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a>"'  <i class="calibre4">It	is	a	liberty	I	permit	myself</i>,'	was	the	swift	reply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In	 the	 last	 bar,	 which	 did	 not	 appear	 to	 be	 filled	 satisfactorily,	 the	 composer directed	 the	 insertion	 of	 a	 figure	 2.	 This	 meant,	 as	 became	 clear	 through	 a subsequent	reference	to	his	printed	scores,	the	playing	of	two	quarter-notes	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	of	three	eighth	notes,	but	was	not	understood	at	the	moment	by	Blake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'  <i class="calibre4">Never	 mind</i>,'	 said	 'E.	 A.,'	 pleasantly,	 '  <i class="calibre4">I	 will	 write	 it	 differently</i>.'	 The	 figure	 '2' </p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 cancelled,	 and	 the	 measure	 was	 completed	 by	 a	 rest.	 This	 is	 only	 one	 of many	astonishing	passages	in	this	dialogue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In	 all	 this	 work	 'E.	 A.'	 carried	 himself	 like	 the	 creative	 master.	 He	 held	 to	 a plane	 apparently	 far	 above	 the	 psychic's	 musical	 knowledge,	 and	 often	 above</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 of	 his	 amanuensis.	 He	 was	 highly	 technical	 throughout	 in	 both	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">composition	and	the	playing,	and	Blake	followed	his	will,	for	the	most	part,	as	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 whispers	 came	 from	 Alexander	 himself.	 And	 yet	 I	 repeat	 the	 music	 and	 all may	have	come	from	a	union	of	Blake's	mind	with	that	of	the	psychic,	with	now</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	then	a	mixture	of	my	own	subconscious	self." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	was	the	psychic	doing	all	this	time?"	asked	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	was	listening	to	the	voice	and	repeating	the	words	which	Blake	could	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear.	She	seemed	merely	the	somewhat	bored	interpreter	of	words	which	she	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 fully	 understand.	 It	 was	 precisely	 as	 if	 she	 were	 catching	 by	 wireless</p>
<p class="calibre1">telephone	 the	 whispered	 instructions	 of	 my	 friend	 'E.	 A.'	 I	 can't	 believe	 she consciously	deceived	us,	but	it	is	possible	that	these	ventriloquistic	voices	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">become	a	subconscious	habit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"One	other	very	curious	event	I	must	note.	Once,	when	Blake	was	asking	for	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">correction,	the	whisper	exclaimed:	'  <i class="calibre4">I	can't	see	it,	Blake! </i>' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'  <i class="calibre4">Cover	 it	 with	 your	 hand</i>,'	 interjected	 the	 'control.'	 Blake	 did	 so,	 and	 'E.	 A.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">spoke,	gratefully:	'  <i class="calibre4">I	see	it	now. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Seeing	 cannot	 mean	 the	 same	 with	 them	 that	 it	 does	 with	 us,"	 exclaimed Fowler.	 "You	 remember	 Crookes	 put	 his	 finger	 on	 the	 print	 of	 a	 newspaper behind	 his	 back,	 and	 the	 'spirit'	 spoke	 the	 word	 that	 was	 under	 his	 finger-tip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	apprehend	by	means	of	some	form	of	etheric	vibration	not	known	to	us." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 resumed:	 "Let	 me	 stop	 here	 for	 a	 moment	 to	 emphasize	 a	 very	 curious</p>
<p class="calibre1">contradiction.	 Between	 my	 first	 séance	 with	 Mrs.	 Hartley	 and	 this,	 our	 third</p>
<p class="calibre1">attempt	to	secure	the	music,	I	had	held	two	sittings	in	the	home	of	a	friend.	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>Hartley	 had	 come	 to	 the	 house	 about	 ten	 o'clock	 in	 the	 morning,	 bringing nothing	 with	 her	 except	 a	 few	 tips	 of	 soft	 slate-pencil.	 During	 the	 sitting	 I	 had secured	in	the	middle	of	a	manila	pad	(a	pad	which	the	psychic	had	never	seen</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	which	I	had	taken	from	my	friend's	desk)	these	words:	'  <i class="calibre4">Have	Schumann.—E. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">A. </i>'	 This	 writing	 I	 had	 taken	 to	 mean	 that	 'Ernest'	 wanted	 to	 hear	 some	 of Schumann's	music,	and	in	that	understanding	I	had	called	Blake	in	to	play.	This</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 seemed	 at	 the	 moment	 perfectly	 conclusive	 and	 entirely	 satisfactory;	 yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">now,	 in	 this	 final	 sitting,	 'E.	 A.'	 suddenly	 reverted	 to	 this	 message,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">whispered:	'  <i class="calibre4">Garland,	there	is	a	certain	étude	which	I	took	to	Schumann.	I	want</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">you	to	regain	it	and	take	it	to	Smart.	Mary	will	know	about	it.	I	meant	to	take	it</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">away,	but	did	I?	I	was	so	badly	off	mentally	that	I	don't	know	whether	I	did	or</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">not. </i>'	 Whereupon	 Blake	 said:	 'Do	 you	 mean	 Schumann	 the	 publisher?'	 '  <i class="calibre4">Yes</i>,'	 'E. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A.'	 replied;	 and	 I	 said:	 'And	 you	 want	 the	 manuscript	 recalled	 from	 Schumann and	given	to	Smart?'	'  <i class="calibre4">Yes</i>,'	was	his	very	definite	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Very	 well,	 I	 will	 attend	 to	 it,'	 I	 replied.	 'What	 do	 you	 want	 done	 with	 this fragment,	"Isinghere"?'	I	pursued.	'Shall	I	publish	it?'	'  <i class="calibre4">That	is	what	it	is	for</i>,'	 he answered,	curtly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'How	many	bars	are	in	it?'	asked	Blake.	'Forty?'	'  <i class="calibre4">More</i>,'	returned	the	whisper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Blake	made	the	mistake	of	again	suggesting	an	answer.	'As	many	as	sixty?' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'  <i class="calibre4">Yes,	 sixty	 or	 seventy</i>,'	 was	 the	 answer,	 like	 an	 echo.	 Here	 Blake's	 thought governed,	 but	 it	 was	 evident	 that	 the	 psychic	 had	 no	 clear	 conception	 of	 what this	reference	to	Schumann	meant	in	the	first	instance,	for	'E.	A.'	was	unable	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">complete	 his	 sentence,	 which	 should	 have	 read:	 '  <i class="calibre4">Have	 Schumann	 return	 a</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">certain	étude	which	I	took.—E.	A. </i>'	Furthermore,	the	psychic	evidently	believed</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 truth	 of	 the	 message	 or	 she	 would	 not	 have	 gone	 into	 it	 with	 such</p>
<p class="calibre1">particularity;	 she	 would	 have	 been	 lacking	 in	 caution	 to	 have	 given	 me	 such</p>
<p class="calibre1">definite	and	detailed	information,	knowing	that	it	was	all	false. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	 far	 as	 my	 own	 mind	 is	 concerned,	 I	 had	 no	 knowledge	 of	 such	 a	 music publisher	 as	 Schumann.	 Smart	 I	 had	 met.	 Blake,	 however,	 knew	 of	 both	 firms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	entire	message	and	the	method	of	its	communication	were	deeply	exciting	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 time,	 and	 completed	 what	 seemed	 like	 a	 highly	 intellectual	 test	 of	 identity, and	we	both	left	the	house	of	the	psychic	with	a	feeling	of	having	been	very	near</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	our	dead	friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'To	identify	one	of	these	bars	of	music	would	be	a	good	test,'	said	Blake,	'but	to find	that	 <i class="calibre4">étude</i>	at	Schumann's	would	be	a	triumph.' </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a>"'To	 find	 the	 manuscript	 fragment	 would	 be	 still	 more	 convincing,'	 was	 my answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Imagine	my	disappointment	when,	in	answer	to	my	inquiry,	Schumann	replied</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	no	such	 <i class="calibre4">étude</i>	had	ever	been	in	his	hands,	and	Alexander's	family	 reported</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 no	 fragment	 called	 'Unghere'	 could	 be	 found	 among	 the	 composer's</p>
<p class="calibre1">manuscripts." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fowler	 shared	 my	 regret.	 "What	 about	 the	 other	 messages?	 Were	 they	 all</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappointing?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No;	some	of	them	were	not.	The	most	intimate	were	true;	and	a	signature	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	 on	 the	 slate	 under	 test	 conditions,	 and	 which	 I	 valued	 very	 little	 at	 the moment,	turned	out	to	be	almost	the	exact	duplicate	of	Alexander's	signature	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	used	to	write	it	when	a	youth	twenty	years	ago.	As	a	matter	of	fact,	it	closely</p>
<p class="calibre1">resembled	the	signature	appended	to	a	framed	letter	which	used	to	hang	upon	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wall	 of	 his	 study.	 But,	 even	 so,	 its	 reproduction	 under	 these	 conditions	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">sufficiently	puzzling." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	 was	 Blake's	 conclusion?	 Did	 he	 put	 the	 same	 value	 upon	 it	 all	 that	 you did?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	 I	 think	 he	 was	 quite	 as	 deeply	 impressed	 as	 I.	 He	 said	 the	 music	 seemed like	 Alexander's	 music,	 somehow	 distorted	 by	 the	 medium	 through	 which	 it</p>
<p class="calibre1">came.	 'It	 was	 like	 seeing	 Alexander	 through	 a	 pane	 of	 crinkly	 glass,'	 he	 put	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 he	 added:	 'I	 had	 the	 sense	 of	 being	 in	 long-distance	 contact	 with	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">composer	 himself.'	 He	 had	 no	 doubt	 of	 the	 supernormal	 means	 through	 which</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	writing	came,	but	he	remains	doubtful	of	the	value	of	the	music	as	evidence</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	'Ernest's'	return	from	the	world	of	shadows." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Have	you	tried	to	secure	more	of	the	music?"	Fowler	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	not	specifically;	but	I've	had	one	further	inconclusive	sitting	since	then	with Mrs.	Hartley.	Almost	immediately	'Ernest'	whispered	a	greeting	and	said:	'  <i class="calibre4">I	want</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">to	go	on	with	that	music,	Garland.	I	want	to	put	B	and	D	and	A	into	the	first	bar</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">—it's	only	a	bare	sketch	as	it	stands. </i>' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"To	this	I	replied:	'I	can't	do	it,	'Ernest.'	It's	beyond	me.	Wait	till	I	can	get	Blake again.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This	ended	his	attempt,	although	he	was	'terribly	anxious,'	so	the	psychic	said.	I am	going	to	try	for	the	completion	of	this	score	through	another	psychic.	If	I	can</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a>get	 that	 eighth	 bar	 taken	 up	 and	 carried	 on	 by	 'Ernest'	 through	 another	 psychic the	case	will	become	complicated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	have	gone	into	detail	in	my	account	of	this	experiment,	for	the	reason	that	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">illustrates	very	aptly	the	inextricable	tangle	of	truth	and	error	which	most	'spirit</p>
<p class="calibre1">communications'	 present.	 It	 typifies	 in	 little	 the	 elusive	 problem	 of	 spirit</p>
<p class="calibre1">identification	which	many	a	veteran	investigator	is	still	at	work	upon,	after	years</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	study.	Maxwell	gives	a	case	of	long-continued	unintentional	and	unconscious</p>
<p class="calibre1">deception	 of	 the	 general	 kind	 which	 went	 far	 to	 prevent	 his	 acceptance	 of	 the spirit	hypothesis." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 don't	 think	 the	 failure	 to	 find	 the	 musical	 fragment	 invalidates	 this	 beautiful communication,"	declared	Fowler.	"You	admit	that	many	of	the	messages	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	point,	and	that	some	of	them	were	very	intimate	and	personal." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	 speaking	 generally,	 I	 would	 say	 that	 'E.	 A.'	 might	 have	 uttered	 all	 the words	 and	 dictated	 all	 the	 messages	 except	 those	 that	 related	 to	 the	 publishing matter;	but	there	is	the	final	test.	Schumann	declares	that	no	such	manuscript	has</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever	been	in	his	hands." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	may	be	mistaken,	or	'E.	A.'	may	have	misspoken	himself—for,	as	William</p>
<p class="calibre1">James	 infers,	 the	 spirits	 find	 themselves	 tremendously	 hampered	 in	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1">attempts	 to	 manifest	 themselves.	 Furthermore,	 you	 say	 you	 could	 not	 hear	 all</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	'E.	A.'	spoke—you	or	the	psychic	may	have	misunderstood	him.	In	any	case, </p>
<p class="calibre1">it	all	seems	to	me	a	fine	attempt	at	identification." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	wish	 I	 could	put	 the	 same	value	 on	 it	 now	that	 I	 did	when	 Blake	 played	the first	bar	of	that	thrilling	little	melody;	but	I	can't.	As	it	recedes	it	loses	its	power over	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	did	Alexander's	family	think	of	the	music?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	thought	it	more	like	a	Cheyenne	or	Omaha	love-song	than	like	a	melody</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	'Ernest's'	own	composition." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	that	only	adds	to	the	mystery	of	the	mental	process,"	objected	Miller.	"That supposes	it	to	have	come	out	of	your	mind." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	can't	believe	that	I	had	any	hand	in	the	musical	part	of	it,	and	I	can't	persuade myself	that	my	dead	friend	was	present." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Suppose	 you	 had	 been	 able	 to	 find	 that	 musical	 fragment,	 would	 it	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a>converted	you?"	This	was	Miller's	challenge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	 for	 even	 then	 some	 living	 person	 might	 have	 known	 of	 it—must	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">known	of	it;	and	if	a	knowledge	of	it	lay	in	some	other	mind,	no	matter	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	no	matter	how	deeply	buried	in	the	subconscious,	that	knowledge,	according</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	Myers	and	Hudson,	would	have	been	accessible	to	the	supernormal	perception</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	psychic." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fowler	 interrogated	 me:	 "But	 suppose	 a	 phantom	 form	 resembling	 'E.	 A.'	 had <i class="calibre4">spoken</i>	these	things	to	you	face	to	face—what	then?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	would	not	have	believed,	even	then." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	for	one	reason,	belief	is	not	a	matter	of	the	will;	it	is	not	even	dependent upon	evidence." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller	interrupted	me.	"I	am	interested	in	the	writing.	How	do	you	account	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	writing?	As	I	understand	it,	the	psychic	did	not,	in	some	instances,	touch	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">slate	while	the	writing	was	going	on.	Are	you	sure	of	Blake?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Blake	is	as	much	to	be	trusted	as	I	am.	No,	I	am	forced	to	a	practical	acceptance</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	theory	of	the	fluidic	arm,	and	yet	this	is	a	most	astounding	admission.	We</p>
<p class="calibre1">must	 suppose	 that	 the	 psychic	 was	 able	 to	 read	 our	 minds	 and	 write	 down	 our mingled	and	confused	musical	conceptions	by	means	of	a	supernumerary	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 happens	 that	 I	 have	 since	 seen	 these	 etheric	 hands	 in	 action,	 which	 makes	 it easier	 for	 me	 to	 conceive	 of	 such	 a	 process.	 I	 have	 seen	 them	 dart	 forth	 from another	medium	precisely	as	described	by	Scarpa.	I	have	seen	them	lift	a	glass	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">water,	and	I	have	had	them	touch	my	knees	beneath	a	table	while	slate-writing</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 going	 on—so	 that,	 given	 the	 power	 to	 read	 my	 mind,	 there	 is	 nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">impossible	 (having	 regard	 to	 Bottazzi's	 definite	 experiments)	 in	 the	 idea	 of	 the etheric	hand's	setting	down	the	music	and	reproducing	the	signature	of	'E.	A.'	In</p>
<p class="calibre1">fact,	at	a	recent	sitting	in	a	private	house	with	a	young	male	psychic,	we	had	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">precise	feat	performed.	Said	the	psychic	to	our	host,	Dr.	Towne,	'Think	hard	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">signature	 that	 is	 very	 familiar	 to	 you,'	 and	 Dr.	 Towne	 fixed	 his	 mind	 upon	 the signature	of	his	brother,	and	immediately,	while	the	young	man's	material	hands</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 controlled,	 his	 etheric	 hand	 seized	 a	 pencil	 in	 the	 middle	 of	 the	 table	 and reproduced	the	signature." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Could	you	see	this	hand?"	Miller	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a>"Not	in	this	case;	but	at	a	sitting	which	followed	this,	during	such	time	as	I	sat beside	the	psychic	and	controlled	one	hand,	I	plainly	saw	the	supernumerary	arm</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	hand	dart	forth	and	seize	a	pencil.	I	saw	a	hand	very	plainly	cross	my	knee</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	grasp	me	by	the	forearm.	All	of	this	has	its	bearing	upon	this	very	curious</p>
<p class="calibre1">phenomenon	of	the	reproduction	of	'E.	A's.'	youthful	signature,	which	remained</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	puzzling	to	us	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	 did	 you	 not	 say	 that	 'E.	 A.'	 at	 times	 represented	 an	 opposing	 will?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">questioned	 Fowler—"that	 he	 disputed	 certain	 passages	 with	 Blake,	 and	 that	 he finally	carried	his	point	in	opposition	to	every	mind	in	the	circle?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	that	happened	several	times,	and	was	all	very	convincing	at	the	time.	And</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet	 this	 opposition	 may	 have	 been	 more	 apparent	 than	 real.	 It	 may	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">concerned	our	conscious	wills	only;	our	subconscious	selves	may	have	been	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">accord,	working	together	as	one." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fowler	was	a	bit	irritated.	"If	you	are	disposed	to	make	the	subconscious	will	all-</p>
<p class="calibre1">powerful	 and	 omniscient,	 nothing	 can	 be	 proved.	 It	 seems	 to	 me	 an	 evasion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,	 let	 me	 ask	 how	 you	 would	 explain	 away	 a	 spirit	 form	 carrying	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice,	the	features,	and	the	musical	genius	of	'E.	A.'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	there	is	the	teleplastic	theory	of	Albert	de	Rochas.	He	claims	to	have	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">able	not	merely	to	cause	a	hypnotized	subject	to	exteriorize	her	astral	self,	but	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">mould	this	vapory	substance	as	a	sculptor	models	wax.	So	I	can	imagine	that	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">momentary	radiant	apparition	might	have	been	created	in	the	image	of	my	sister</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	'David'	or	'E.	A.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"To	 my	 thinking,	 that	 is	 more	 complicated	 and	 incredible	 than	 the	 spirit hypothesis,"	objected	Fowler. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothing	 can	 be	 more	 incredible	 to	 me	 than	 the	 spirit	 hypothesis,"	 I	 replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But,	then,	everything	is	incredible	in	the	last	analysis.	I	am	the	more	disposed	to believe	 in	 the	 teleplastic	 theory,	 for	 the	 reason	 that	 I	 have	 recently	 had	 an opportunity	 to	 witness	 a	 particularly	 incredible	 thing:	 the	 materialization	 of	 a complete	 human	 form	 outside	 the	 cabinet	 and	 beside	 the	 psychic—a</p>
<p class="calibre1">phenomenon	which	has	a	special	bearing	upon	the	matter	of	identity	which	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	 discussing.	 The	 sitting	 took	 place	 in	 a	 small	 private	 house	 here	 in	 the	 city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 psychic	 in	 the	 case	 was	 a	 young	 business	 man	 who	 is	 careful	 not	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">advertise	his	power.	For	four	years	he	has	been	holding	secret	developing	circles</p>
<p class="calibre1">whereto	 a	 few	 of	 his	 friends	 only	 are	 invited.	 I	 was	 present	 last	 Sunday,	 and shared	in	the	marvels.	The	place	of	the	séance	was	the	parlor	of	his	apartment, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p163"></a>his	 young	 wife	 and	 little	 daughter	 being	 present.	 There	 was,	 in	 addition,	 an elderly	lady,	mother-in-law	of	the	psychic,	and	a	Polish	student	whom	I	will	call</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jacob.	 I	 am	 quite	 sure	 that	 no	 one	 else	 entered	 or	 left	 the	 room	 during	 the evening.	 Mrs.	 Pratt,	 the	 mother-in-law,	 occupied	 a	 seat	 between	 me	 and	 Jacob. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 little	 girl	 sat	 at	 the	 window,	 and	 was	 under	 my	 eye	 all	 the	 time.	 The	 wife spent	 most	 of	 the	 evening	 at	 the	 piano	 on	 my	 right.	 The	 room	 was	 fairly	 dark, though	the	light	of	a	far-away	street	lamp	shone	in	at	the	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 psychic	 retired	 into	 a	 little	 alcove	 bedroom,	 which	 served	 as	 cabinet,	 and the	curtain	had	hardly	fallen	between	him	and	our	group	when	the	spirit	voices</p>
<p class="calibre1">began.	 The	 first	 one	 to	 speak	 was	 'Evan,'	 the	 'guide,'	 and	 I	 remarked	 that	 his voice	was	precisely	like	a	falsetto	disguise	of	the	psychic's	own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Soon	 'Evan'	 and	 other	 spirits	 appeared	 at	 the	 opening	 of	 the	 curtain.	 The	 wife called	 them	 each	 by	 name,	 but	 I	 could	 see	 only	 certain	 curious	 fluctuating, </p>
<p class="calibre1">cloud-like	 forms,	 like	 puffs	 of	 fire-lit	 steam.	 The	 effect	 was	 not	 that	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">illuminated	 gauze,	 but	 more	 like	 illuminated	 vapor.	 At	 length	 came	 one	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">spoke	in	a	deep	voice,	using	a	foreign	language.	Jacob,	the	young	Pole,	sprang</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	 in	 joyous	 excitement,	 saying	 that	 he	 had	 sat	 many	 times	 in	 this	 little	 circle, but	that	this	was	the	first	time	a	spirit	had	spoken	to	him	in	his	own	tongue.	As</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 conversed	 together,	 I	 detected	 a	 close	 similarity	 of	 accent	 and	 of	 tone	 in their	 speech.	 It	 certainly	 sounded	 like	 the	 Polish	 language,	 but	 I	 could	 not	 rid myself	of	the	impression	that	the	Pole	was	talking	to	himself." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	do	you	mean	by	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	mean	that	the	accent,	inflection,	and	quality	of	the	ghost's	voice	were	identical with	 that	 of	 the	 living	 man,	 and	 this	 became	 still	 more	 striking	 when,	 a	 little later,	Jacob	returned	to	his	seat,	and	the	'Count,'	his	visitor,	called	for	the	Polish</p>
<p class="calibre1">national	 hymn.	 Jacob	 then	 sang,	 and	 the	 phantom	 sang	 with	 him.	 Now	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	like	a	clear	case	of	identification,	and	was	perfectly	satisfactory	to	Jacob, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 I	 had	 observed	 this	 fact:	 the	 Pole	 was	 an	 indifferent	 singer—having	 hard work	to	keep	the	key—and	the	'Count'	was	troubled	in	the	same	way.	His	deep, </p>
<p class="calibre1">almost	toneless,	singing	struck	me	as	a	dead,	flat,	wooden	echo	of	Jacob's	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	short,	it	was	as	if	the	psychic	had	built	up	a	personality	partly	out	of	himself, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	mainly	out	of	his	Polish	sitter,	and	as	if	this	etheric	duplication	were	singing</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	unison	with	its	progenitor." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	nonsense!"	exclaimed	Fowler. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did	he	manufacture	a	double	out	of	you?"	queried	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p164"></a>"No	one	spoke	to	me	from	the	shadow,	except	the	'guide,'	although	I	was	hoping for	some	new	word	from	'Ernest,'	and	kept	him	uppermost	in	my	mind.	A	form</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	 out	 into	 the	 centre	 of	 the	 room,	 which	 the	 wife	 said	 was	 'Evan,'	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">requested	me	to	shake	his	hand.	This	I	did.	The	hand	felt	as	if	it	were	covered</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	some	gauzy	veiling.	My	belief	is	that	it	was	the	psychic	himself	who	stood</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	me,	probably	in	trance.	I	could	see	nothing,	however.	I	do	not	remember</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 I	 could	 detect	 any	 shadow	 even;	 but	 the	 hand	 was	 real,	 and	 the	 voice	 and manner	of	speech	were	precisely	those	of	the	psychic	himself." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 repeat	 that	 this	 does	 not	 necessarily	 imply	 fraud,	 for	 the	 mind	 and	 vocal organs	of	the	psychic	are	often	used	in	that	way,"	Fowler	argued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	grant	that.	Up	to	this	point	I	had	been	able	to	see	nothing	but	dim	outlines.	But toward	 the	 end	 of	 the	 evening	 the	 psychic	 advanced	 from	 the	 cabinet	 and	 in	 a dazed	 way	 ordered	 the	 lamp	 to	 be	 lit.	 This	 was	 done.	 He	 then	 asked	 that	 it	 be turned	 low.	 This	 was	 also	 done.	 Thereupon,	 directing	 his	 gaze	 toward	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">curtain,	he	called	twice	in	a	tone	of	command,	'  <i class="calibre4">Come	out! </i>' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 could	 place	 every	 one	 in	 the	 room	 at	 the	 moment.	 I	 could	 see	 the	 psychic distinctly.	I	could	discern	the	color	of	his	coat	and	the	expression	of	his	face.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">stood	at	least	six	feet	from	the	opening	in	the	curtain.	At	his	second	cry,	in	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	detected	a	note	of	entreaty,	I	saw	a	luminous	form,	taller	than	himself,	suddenly</p>
<p class="calibre1">appear	 before	 the	 curtain	 and	 stand	 bowing	 in	 silence.	 I	 could	 perceive	 neither face,	 eyes,	 nor	 feet,	 but	 I	 could	 make	 out	 the	 arms	 under	 the	 shining	 robe,	 the shape	of	the	head	and	the	shoulders,	and	as	he	bowed	I	could	see	the	bending	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	neck.	It	certainly	was	not	a	clothes-horse.	The	covering	was	not	so	much	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">robe	as	a	swathing,	and	we	had	time	to	discuss	it	briefly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"However,	my	eyes	were	mainly	busy	with	the	psychic,	whose	actions	impressed</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	deeply.	He	had	the	air	of	an	anxious	man	undergoing	a	dangerous	ordeal.	His</p>
<p class="calibre1">right	 hand	 was	 stretched	 stiffly	 toward	 the	 phantom,	 his	 left	 was	 held	 near	 his heart;	 his	 knees	 seemed	 to	 tremble,	 and	 his	 body	 appeared	 to	 be	 irresistibly drawn	 toward	 the	 cabinet.	 Slowly,	 watchfully,	 fearfully,	 he	 approached	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">phantom.	 The	 figure	 turned	 toward	 him,	 and	 a	 moment	 later	 they	 met—they</p>
<p class="calibre1">clung	 together,	 they	 appeared	 to	 coalesce,	 and	 the	 psychic	 fell	 through	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">curtain	to	the	floor	of	the	cabinet,	like	a	man	smitten	with	death." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	do	you	wish	to	imply?"	asked	Miller.	"Do	you	mean	that	the	man	and	the ghost	were	united	in	some	way?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Precisely	 so.	 The	 'spirit'	 seemed	 drawn	 by	 some	 magnetic	 force	 toward	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p165"></a>psychic,	and	the	psychic	seemed	under	an	immense	strain	to	keep	the	apparition exterior	 to	 himself.	 When	 they	 met	 the	 spectre	 vanished,	 and	 the	 psychic's	 fall seemed	 inevitable—a	 collapse	 from	 utter	 exhaustion.	 I	 was	 at	 the	 moment</p>
<p class="calibre1">convinced	 that	 I	 had	 seen	 a	 vaporous	 entity	 born	 of	 the	 medium.	 It	 seemed	 a clear	 case	 of	 projection	 of	 the	 astral	 body.	 In	 the	 pause	 which	 followed	 the psychic's	fall	the	young	wife	turned	to	me	and	said:	'Sometimes,	if	my	husband</p>
<p class="calibre1">does	not	reach	the	spirit	form	in	time,	he	falls	 <i class="calibre4">outside</i>	 the	 curtain.'	 She	 did	 not seem	especially	alarmed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	young	psychic	himself,	however,	told	me	afterward	that	he	was	undergoing</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	tremendous	strain	as	he	stood	there	commanding	the	spirit	to	appear.	'I	had	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fierce	pain	in	the	centre	of	my	forehead,'	he	said.	'I	couldn't	get	my	breath.	I	felt</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	if	all	my	substance,	my	strength,	was	being	drawn	out	of	me.	My	legs	seemed</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	to	give	way.	It	is	always	hard	to	produce	a	form	so	far	away	from	me	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 am	 on	 the	 outside	 of	 the	 cabinet	 in	 the	 light.	 The	 greater	 the	 distance,	 the greater	 the	 strain.'	 I	 asked	 him	 what	 happened	 when	 he	 and	 the	 form	 rushed</p>
<p class="calibre1">together,	and	he	answered:	'As	soon	as	I	touched	it,	it	re-entered	my	body.' <a href="#p170">"[2]</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 wonder	 why	 the	 spirits	 are	 always	 clothed	 in	 that	 luminous	 gauze?"	 queried Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	are	not,"	replied	Fowler.	"More	often	they	come	in	the	clothing	which	was their	habitual	wear." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 asked	 this	 young	 psychic	 if	 drapery	 were	 used	 out	 of	 respect	 to	 us	 mortals, and	he	replied:	'No;	the	forms	are	swathed	not	from	sense	of	propriety	so	much</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	to	protect	the	body,	which	is	often	incomplete	at	the	extremities.'	The	wife	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jacob	told	me	that	at	one	of	their	meetings	a	naked	Hercules	suddenly	appeared</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	the	curtain.	The	Pole	declared:	'He	was	of	giant	size	and	strength.	I	felt	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 muscles	 (he	 was	 clothed	 only	 in	 a	 loincloth),	 and	 I	 closely	 studied	 his tremendous	arms	and	shoulders.	The	medium,	as	you	know,	is	a	small,	thin	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 called	 this	 figure	 "the	 man	 from	 Mars."	 He	 was	 at	 least	 six	 feet	 high,	 and strong	 as	 a	 lion.	 He	 rushed	 back	 into	 the	 cabinet,	 and	 came	 out	 holding	 the medium	above	his	head	on	his	upraised	palms.	It	was	very	wonderful.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	didn't	see	anything	like	that,	did	you?"	asked	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	 I	 replied;	 "but	 I	 did	 see	 the	 development	 of	 a	 figure	 apparently	 from	 the floor	 between	 me	 and	 the	 curtain	 of	 the	 cabinet.	 My	 attention	 was	 called	 to something	wavering,	shimmering,	and	fluctuating	about	a	foot	above	the	carpet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	neither	steam	nor	flame.	It	seemed	compounded	of	both	luminous	vapor</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a>and	puffing	clouds	of	drapery.	It	rose	and	fell	in	quivering	impulses,	expanding and	contracting,	but	continuing	to	grow	until	at	last	it	towered	to	the	height	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">tall	 man,	 and	 I	 could	 dimly	 discern,	 through	 dark	 draperies	 edged	 with	 light,	 a man's	figure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'This,'	the	young	wife	said,	'is	Judge	White,	the	grandfather	of	the	psychic,'	and she	 conversed	 with	 him,	 but	 only	 for	 a	 few	 moments.	 He	 soon	 dwindled	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">faded	and	melted	away	in	the	same	fashion	as	he	had	come,	recalling	to	my	mind</p>
<p class="calibre1">Richet's	description	of	the	birth	and	disappearance	of	'B.	B.,'	in	Algiers.	I	know</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	 sounds	 like	 the	 veriest	 dreaming,	 but	 you	 must	 remember	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">materializations	 much	 more	 wonderful	 have	 been	 seen	 and	 analyzed	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">clinical	 laboratories	 of	 Turin	 and	 Naples.	 Morselli,	 Bottazzi,	 Lombroso,	 Porro, and	 Foà	 have	 been	 confronted	 by	 similar	 apparitions.	 They	 saw	 'sinister'	 faces, and	 were	 repelled	 by	 'Satanic	 hands	 agile	 and	 prompt'	 in	 cabinets	 of	 their	 own construction,	 surrounded	 by	 their	 own	 registering	 machinery,	 and	 Richet</p>
<p class="calibre1">photographed	just	such	figures	as	this	I	have	described. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	question	with	me	is	not,	Do	these	forms	exist?	but,	What	produces	them?	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">am	describing	this	sitting	to	explain	what	I	mean	by	the	ideoplastic	or	teleplastic</p>
<p class="calibre1">theory.	 If,	 for	 example,	 this	 psychic	 had	 known	 me	 well	 enough	 to	 have	 had	 a very	definite	picture	of	'E.	A.,'	he	might	have	been	able	to	model	from	the	mind-stuff	 that	 he	 or	 the	 circle	 had	 thrown	 off,	 a	 luminous	 image	 of	 my	 friend,	 and, aided	by	my	subconscious	self,	might	have	united	the	presence	and	the	musical</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought	of	Ernest	Alexander." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	won't	do!"	exclaimed	Miller.	"It's	all	too	destructive,	too	preposterous!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	insist	that	the	spirit	hypothesis	is	simpler,"	repeated	Fowler. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	 isn't	 a	 question	 of	 simplicity,"	 I	 retorted.	 "It's	 a	 question	 of	 fact.	 If	 the observations	of	scientific	experimentalists	are	of	any	value,	the	teleplastic	theory</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	on	the	point	of	winning	acceptance." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 will	 not	 admit	 that,"	 rejoined	 Fowler.	 "For,	 even	 if	 you	 throw	 out	 all	 the enormous	 mass	 of	 evidence	 accumulated	 by	 spiritistic	 investigators,	 you	 still</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 the	 conversion	 of	 Wallace,	 Lodge,	 and	 Lombroso,	 not	 to	 speak	 of	 De</p>
<p class="calibre1">Vesme,	 Venzano,	 and	 other	 well-known	 men	 of	 science,	 to	 account	 for.	 Even</p>
<p class="calibre1">Crookes	 himself	 admits	 that	 nothing	 but	 some	 form	 of	 spirit	 hypothesis	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">capable	of	explaining	 <i class="calibre4">all</i>	the	phenomena;	and	in	a	recent	issue	of	the	 <i class="calibre4">Annals	 of</i> <i class="calibre4">Psychic	 Science</i>	 Lombroso	 writes	 a	 paper	 making	 several	 very	 strong	 points against	 the	 biologic	 theory.	 One	 of	 these	 is	 the	 simultaneous	 occurrence	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a>phenomena.	'Can	the	subconscious	self	act	in	several	places	at	once?'	he	asks.	A second	objection	lies	in	the	fact	that	movements	occur	in	opposition	to	the	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	psychic—as,	for	example,	when	Eusapia	was	transported	in	her	chair.	'Can</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	man	lift	himself	by	his	boot-straps?'	is	the	question.	'The	centre	of	gravity	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">body	 cannot	 be	 altered	 in	 space	 unless	 acted	 upon	 by	 an	 external	 force. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore,	the	phenomena	of	levitation	cannot	be	considered	to	be	produced	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">energy	emanating	from	the	medium.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	think	that	follows,"	I	argued.	"Force	may	be	exerted	unconsciously	and invisibly.	Because	the	psychic	does	not	 <i class="calibre4">consciously</i>	will	to	do	a	certain	thing	is no	 proof	 that	 the	 action	 does	 not	 originate	 in	 the	 deeps	 of	 her	 personality.	 We know	very	little	of	this	obscure	region	of	our	minds." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fowler	was	ready	with	his	answer:	"But	let	us	take	the	case	that	Lombroso	cites</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	beautiful	woman	spirit	whose	hand	twice	dashed	the	photographic	plates</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 the	 grasp	 of	 those	 who	 wished	 to	 secure	 her	 picture.	 Here	 was	 plainly	 an opposing	 will,	 for	 the	 psychic	 was	 lending	 herself	 to	 the	 experiment,	 and	 the spectators	 were	 eager	 for	 its	 success.	 Notwithstanding	 which	 co-operation	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1">phantom	bitterly	opposed	the	wishes	of	every	one	present,	and	it	was	 <i class="calibre4">afterward</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">learned	 that	 there	 was	 a	 special	 reason	 why	 she	 did	 not	 wish	 to	 leave	 positive proofs	of	her	identity.	'It	is	evident,	therefore,'	concludes	Lombroso,	'that	a	third</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	can	intervene	in	spiritistic	phenomena.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Furthermore,	Dr.	Venzano,	as	well	as	De	Vesme,	have	taken	up	the	same	body</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 facts	 upon	 which	 Foà	 and	 Morselli	 base	 their	 theory,	 and	 arrive	 at	 a	 totally different	conclusion.	They	call	attention	to	a	dozen	events	that	can	be	explained</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	on	the	theory	of	discarnate	intelligences.	Venzano	observed	that	the	forms</p>
<p class="calibre1">occurred	in	several	places	at	once,	that	they	appeared	in	many	shapes	and	many</p>
<p class="calibre1">guises.	Some	were	like	children,	some	had	curly	hair,	some	had	beards.	In	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">case	 identification	 was	 made	 by	 introducing	 the	 finger	 of	 one	 of	 the	 sitters within	the	phantom	mouth	to	prove	the	loss	of	a	molar	tooth.	Sometimes	the	hair</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	these	heads	was	plaited	like	that	of	a	girl.	Some	of	the	hands	were	large	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">black,	 others	 fair	 and	 pink—like	 a	 child's.	 In	 short,	 he	 argues	 that	 the	 medium could	not	have	determined	the	size,	shape,	or	color	of	the	phantoms." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	that	does	not	really	militate	against	the	ideoplastic	theory,"	I	retorted.	"It	is as	easy	to	produce	a	phantom	with	hair	plaited	as	it	is	to	produce	one	with	hair	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">curls.	 If	 it	 is	 a	 case	 of	 the	 modelling	 of	 the	 etheric	 vapor	 by	 the	 mind	 of	 the psychic,	 these	 differences	 would	 be	 produced	 naturally	 enough.	 The	 forcible</p>
<p class="calibre1">handling	of	the	medium	by	the	invisible	ones	is	a	much	more	difficult	thing	for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a>me	 to	 explain,	 for	 to	 imagine	 the	 psychic	 emitting	 a	 form	 of	 force	 which afterward	proceeds	to	raise	the	psychic	herself	against	her	will—as	Mrs.	Smiley</p>
<p class="calibre1">testifies	happened	again	and	again	in	her	youth—is	to	do	violence	to	all	that	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">know	of	natural	law.	And	yet	it	may	be	that	the	etheric	double	is	able	to	take	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">part	of	the	forces	resident	in	the	circle	of	sitters,	and	so	become	immensely	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">potent	 than	 the	 psychic	 himself,	 as	 in	 the	 case	 of	 the	 'Man	 from	 Mars'—the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hercules	 I	 have	 just	 been	 telling	 you	 about.	 Then,	 as	 to	 the	 content	 of	 these messages,	they	may	be	impulses,	hints,	fragments	of	sentences	caught	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">air	as	one	wireless	operator	intercepts	communications	meant	for	other	stations</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	his	own.	So	that	my	interview	with	'E.	A.'	may	have	been	a	compounding	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	psychic,	Blake,	and	myself,	and	fugitive	natures	afloat	in	the	ether.	In	fact,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">am	not	as	near	a	belief	in	the	return	of	the	dead	as	I	was	when	I	began	this	last</p>
<p class="calibre1">series	 of	 experiments.	 These	 Italian	 scientific	 observers,	 I	 confess,	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">profoundly	affected	my	thought." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your	 idea	 is,	 then,"	 said	 Miller,	 "that	 these	 apparitions	 are	 emanations	 of	 the medium's	physical	substance,	moulded	by	his	will	and	colored	by	the	minds	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	sitters?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	 is	 the	 up-to-date	 theory,	 and	 everything	 that	 I	 have	 experienced	 seems capable	of	a	biologic	interpretation	against	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fowler	hastened	to	weaken	the	force	of	this	statement.	"Spiritists	all	admit	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	forms	of	spirits	are	made	up—partly,	at	least—of	the	psychic's	material	self, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	that	does	not	prove	that	the	mind	of	the	ghost	is	not	a	separate	entity	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	of	the	psychic.	I	grant	that	the	only	difference	between	the	psycho-dynamic</p>
<p class="calibre1">theory	 and	 the	 spiritualistic	 theory	 lies	 in	 the	 question	 of	 the	 origin	 of	 the intelligences	 that	 direct	 the	 manifestation.	 Foà	 would	 say	 they	 spring	 from	 the subconscious	 self	 of	 the	 psychic.	 We	 say	 they	 come	 from	 the	 spirit	 world,	 and there	we	stand." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller's	 words	 were	 keen	 and	 without	 emotion.	 "Until	 all	 phenomena	 are</p>
<p class="calibre1">explained	there	will	be	obscure	happenings	and	things	to	be	explained	by	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	who	can,	but	it	is	no	final	explanation	to	say	'a	man	did	it'	or	'an	intelligence</p>
<p class="calibre1">did	it.'	I	have	often	been	told	that	things	cannot	move	in	certain	ways	or	certain</p>
<p class="calibre1">things	 cannot	 be	 done	 except	 by	 intelligent	 action	 or	 guidance,	 but	 it	 may	 be remembered	 that	 Kepler	 thought	 guiding	 spirits	 were	 needful	 for	 making	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">planets	move	in	their	elliptical	orbits." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your	scientists	are	feeding	millions	of	people	stones,"	exclaimed	Fowler.	"They</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p169"></a>ask	for	bread,	and	you	give	them	slices	of	granite." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Better	 granite	 than	 slime,"	 said	 Miller.	 "I	 am	 with	 the	 biologists	 in	 this campaign.	 Let	 us	 have	 the	 truth,	 no	 matter	 how	 unpalatable	 it	 may	 be.	 If	 these phenomena	exist,	they	are	in	the	domain	of	natural	law	and	can	be	weighed	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">measured.	If	they	are	imaginary,	they	should	be	swept	away,	like	other	dreams	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">superstition	and	ignorance." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fowler	 was	 not	 to	 be	 silenced.	 "I	 predict	 that	 you	 and	 your	 like	 will	 yet	 be forced,	 like	 Lombroso,	 to	 take	 your	 place	 with	 Aksakof,	 Lodge,	 Wallace,	 Du</p>
<p class="calibre1">Prel,	 and	 Crookes,	 who	 have	 come	 to	 admit	 the	 intervention	 of	 discarnate</p>
<p class="calibre1">intelligences.	Lombroso	says,	'We	find,	as	I	already	foresaw	some	years	ago,	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	materialized	bodies	belong	to	the	radiant	state	of	matter,	which	has	now	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sure	 foothold	 in	 science.	 This	 is	 the	 only	 hypothesis	 that	 can	 reconcile	 the ancient	and	universal	belief	in	the	persistence	of	some	manifestation	of	life	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">death	with	the	results	of	science.'	He	adds:	'These	beings,	or	remnants	of	beings, </p>
<p class="calibre1">would	not	be	able	to	obtain	complete	consistency	to	incarnate	themselves,	if	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">did	not	temporarily	borrow	a	part	of	the	medium.  <i class="calibre4">But	to	borrow	force	from	the</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">medium	is	not	the	same	thing	as	to	be	identical	with	the	medium. </i>'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,"	said	I,	"of	this	I	am	certain:	we	cannot	afford	to	ignore	such	experiments as	 those	 of	 Morselli	 and	 Bottazzi.	 I	 am	 aware	 that	 many	 investigators</p>
<p class="calibre1">discountenance	 such	 experiments,	 but	 I	 believe	 with	 Venzano	 that	 the	 physical</p>
<p class="calibre1">phenomena	of	mediumship	cannot	be,	and	ought	not	to	be,	considered	trivial.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	the	spasmodic	movement	of	a	decapitated	frog	that	resulted	in	the	discovery</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 Voltaic	 Pile.	 Furthermore,	 I	 intend	 to	 try	 every	 other	 conceivable</p>
<p class="calibre1">hypothesis	before	accepting	that	of	the	spiritists." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	is	your	reason	for	that?"	asked	Fowler. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Because	 I	 am	 a	 scientist	 in	 my	 sympathies.	 I	 believe	 in	 the	 methods	 of	 the chemist	 and	 the	 electrician.	 I	 prefer	 the	 experimenter	 to	 the	 theorist.	 I	 like	 the calm,	 clear,	 concise	 statements	 of	 these	 European	 savans,	 who	 approach	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">subject,	 not	 as	 bereaved	 persons,	 but	 as	 biologists.	 I	 am	 ready	 to	 go	 wherever science	leads,	and	I	should	be	very	glad	to	 <i class="calibre4">know</i>	that	our	life	here	is	but	a	link	in the	chain	of	existence.	Others	may	have	more	convincing	knowledge	than	I,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	this	present	moment	the	weight	of	evidence	seems	to	me	to	be	on	the	side	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 theory	 that	 mediumship	 is,	 after	 all,	 a	 question	 of	 unexplored	 human</p>
<p class="calibre1">biology." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	see	it	that	way,"	rejoined	Fowler,	calmly.	"Suppose	your	biologists	prove</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p170"></a>that	the	psychic	can	put	forth	a	supernumerary	arm,	or	maintain,	for	a	short	time, a	 complete	 double	 of	 herself.	 Would	 that	 necessarily	 make	 the	 spiritist	 theory untenable?	Is	it	not	fair	to	conclude	that	if	the	soul	or	'astral'	or	'etheric	double' </p>
<p class="calibre1">can	 act	 outside	 the	 living	 body,	 it	 can	 live	 and	 think	 and	 manifest	 after	 the dissolution	 of	 its	 material	 shell?	 Does	 not	 the	 experimental	 work	 of	 Bottazzi, Morselli,	and	De	Rochas	all	make	for	a	spiritual	interpretation	of	life	rather	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	the	position	of	the	materialist?	I	consider	that	they	have	strengthened	rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	weakened	the	mystic	side	of	the	universe.	They	are	bringing	the	wonder	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 world	 back	 to	 the	 positivist.	 Let	 them	 go	 on.	 They	 will	 yet	 demonstrate,	 in spite	of	themselves,	the	immortality	of	the	soul." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 hope	 they	 will,"	 I	 replied.	 "It	 would	 be	 glorious	 at	 this	 time,	 when	 tradition begins	to	fail	of	power,	to	have	a	demonstration	of	immortality	come	through	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">methods	 of	 experimental	 science.	 Certainly	 I	 would	 welcome	 a	 physical	 proof</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 my	 mother	 still	 thinks	 and	 lives,	 and	 that	 Ernest	 and	 other	 of	 my	 dearest friends	 are	 at	 work	 on	 other	 planes	 and	 surrounded	 by	 other	 conditions,	 no</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter	how	different	from	the	conventional	idea	of	paradise	these	environments</p>
<p class="calibre1">might	be;	but	the	proof	must	be	ample	and	very	definite." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller	 put	 in	 a	 last	 word	 of	 warning:	 "Because	 a	 phenomenon	 has	 not	 been explained,	and	no	one	knows	how	to	explain	it,	is	no	reason	for	supposing	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 anything	 extraphysical	 about	 it.	 No	 one	 has	 explained	 the	 first	 cause	 of	 the development	of	an	embryo.	No	one	knows	what	goes	on	in	an	active	nerve,	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">why	 atoms	 are	 selective	 in	 their	 associates.	 Ignorance	 is	 not	 a	 proper	 basis	 for speculation,	 and	 if	 one	 must	 have	 a	 theory,	 let	 it	 be	 one	 having	 some	 obvious continuity	with	our	best	physical	knowledge." </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	at	that	point	our	argument	rested.	We	separated,	and	each	went	his	way,	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	met	by	questions	of	business	and	politics,	and	to	be	once	more	blended	to	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">intelligent	woman	of	thirty-five;	Hamlin	Garland;	and	the	writer,	who	combined</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	functions	of	amanuensis	and	editor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	psychic	was	not	in	a	trance,	and	stated	that	she	had	never	gone	into	one.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">conversed	 throughout	 in	 ordinary	 voice	 and	 manner,	 save	 when,	 with	 a	 certain</p>
<p class="calibre1">emphasis,	she	undertook	to	hasten	the	pace	of	her	lagging	"controls."	The	three sittings	 were	 attended	 by	 little	 noise,	 pounding,	 or	 violence;	 there	 was	 no</p>
<p class="calibre1">breaking	or	crumpling	up	of	slates,	as	had	been	the	case	during	an	earlier	sitting</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	Thursday. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	psychic's	principal	"control"—to	be	known	here	as	"Dr.	Cooke"—spoke	in whispers,	 and	 his	 words	 were	 repeated	 aloud	 by	 the	 psychic	 herself.	 These</p>
<p class="calibre1">whisperings	were	only	occasionally	audible	to	the	writer,	but	they	were	plainly</p>
<p class="calibre1">heard	by	Mr.	Garland.	It	may	be	added	that	on	at	least	two	occasions,	however, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	writer	heard	and	understood	replies	which	the	psychic	declared	had	not	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">audible	 to	 her.	 During	 the	 latter	 portion	 of	 these	 sittings,	 especially	 that	 of Saturday,	 the	 "control"	 seemed	 to	 withdraw	 altogether,	 and	 for	 two	 or	 three hours	the	circle	was	in	apparent	communication—direct,	rapid,	uninterrupted—</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	an	intelligence	that	may	conveniently	be	termed	the	"Composer." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	paraphernalia	for	these	sittings	comprised	the	following:</p>
<p class="calibre1">1.	A	small,	light,	walnut	centre-table,	which	Mr.	Garland	himself	had	assisted	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">repairing	before	the	proceedings	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p173"></a>2.	 A	 silicon	 book-slate,	 eight	 inches	 by	 five	 inches.	 There	 were	 six	 pages—the insides	of	the	covers	and	a	double	leaf.	These	leaves	lay	close	and	flat,	like	those</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	a	book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">3.	A	few	bits	of	slate-pencil,	from	one-quarter	of	an	inch	to	three-eighths	of	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">inch	in	length;	also	a	longer	slate-pencil	used	by	the	writer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">4.	A	small	writing-pad	and	lead-pencil,	for	general	memoranda	and	notations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">5.	 Certain	 fruits	 and	 flowers,	 such	 as	 roses,	 sweet-peas,	 pineapples,	 and	 grape-fruit.	 These	 met	 the	 psychic's	 needs	 or	 fancies,	 and	 were	 brought	 into	 close relation	with	pad	or	slate	when	the	"forces"	seemed	inclined	to	weaken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">6.	The	piano. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shortly	after	the	opening	of	the	Friday-morning	sitting	the	Composer	requested</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 the	 whole	 slate	 be	 ruled	 with	 staves	 for	 writing	 music.	 Throughout	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">preceding	Wednesday	and	Thursday	attempts	at	the	writing	of	music	had	been	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">constant	occurrence;	they	had	come	on	slates,	on	writing-pads,	and	on	the	leaves</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	closed	books.	These	bits	of	musical	notation	had	been	very	fragmentary	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">obscure;	 often	 they	 had	 consisted	 of	 less	 than	 half	 a	 dozen	 notes	 placed	 upon staves	consisting	of	but	three	or	four	lines,	instead	of	five.	The	most	successful</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 these	 earlier	 efforts	 had	 been	 produced	 on	 a	 double	 school-slate,	 with	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">wooden,	 list-bound	 frame:	 two	 measures	 on	 a	 treble	 staff	 had	 been	 sprinkled</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	vague	indications	of	musical	script.	No	attempts	had	yet	been	made	to	bring</p>
<p class="calibre1">even	the	best	of	these	various	writings	to	order	and	intelligibility.	We	were	soon</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 learn	 that	 a	 scrap	 of	 music	 set	 down	 within	 three	 or	 four	 minutes	 was	 to require	 as	 many	 hours	 for	 revision,	 emendation,	 elucidation—for	 editing,	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">brief.	It	is	but	fair,	however,	to	state	that	some	of	this	time	was	taken	up	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">registering	of	irrelevant	messages	from	other	quarters	and	by	digressions	toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Composer's	own	private	concerns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 staff	 drawn	 on	 the	 wooden-framed	 slate	 had	 been	 ruled	 crosswise.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">Composer	 now	 directed	 that	 the	 new	 staves	 to	 be	 drawn	 on	 the	 silicon	 slate</p>
<p class="calibre1">should	run	lengthwise	and	should	cover	every	page	of	it.	This	was	done	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">editor.	 Provision	 was	 asked	 for	 seven	 measures,	 to	 which	 an	 eighth	 was	 added later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During	the	three	minutes	or	so	required	for	writing	on	the	six	pages	of	the	slate, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 position	 of	 the	 slate,	 in	 reference	 to	 the	 editor,	 was	 as	 follows:	 After considerable	moving	about	beneath	the	top	of	the	table,	during	which	time	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p174"></a>principally	 in	 the	 hands	 of	 the	 psychic,	 it	 approached	 the	 writer	 and	 remained with	 him.	 The	 under	 cover	 of	 the	 slate	 (with	 a	 bit	 of	 slate-pencil	 tightly</p>
<p class="calibre1">enclosed)	 rested	 on	 his	 knee;	 the	 upper	 cover	 was	 pressed	 against	 the	 frame	 of the	table.	The	editor's	thumb	rested	rather	lightly	on	the	middle	of	the	nearer	half</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 upper	 cover,	 and	 his	 fingers	 assisted	 in	 supporting	 the	 nearer	 half	 of	 the under	cover.	The	psychic	herself	had	surrendered	the	control	of	the	slate	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">editor,	and	could	have	had	no	contact	with	it	beyond	touching	the	edge	farthest</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	him.	On	the	second	day,	Saturday,	during	which	the	bass	for	the	last	four</p>
<p class="calibre1">measures	was	produced,	the	slate	was	in	the	exclusive	control	of	the	editor,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">psychic	not	touching	it	at	all.	The	progress	of	the	musical	writing	was	both	felt</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 heard;	 it	 was	 a	 combination	 of	 light	 and	 rapid	 scratching,	 pecking,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">twitching,	with	an	occasional	slight	waving	motion	up	and	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	score,	as	first	revealed,	consisted	of	open-headed	notes	with	curved	stems. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 gave	 no	 indications	 of	 varying	 values;	 it	 was	 impossible	 to	 distinguish</p>
<p class="calibre1">quarter-notes	 from	 eighth-notes,	 sixteenth-notes,	 or	 grace-notes;	 and	 no	 rests</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	set	down.	The	notes	were	placed	but	approximately	as	regarded	lines	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">spaces.	 No	 stems,	 save	 in	 one	 or	 two	 instances,	 united	 the	 chords,	 the	 notes	 of which	 were	 written	 more	 or	 less	 above	 one	 another,	 yet	 detached.	 A	 few</p>
<p class="calibre1">unsatisfactory	 attempts	 were	 made	 by	 the	 Composer	 to	 place	 the	 bars.	 These</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 mostly	 put	 in	 by	 the	 editor—sometimes	 by	 the	 direction	 or	 with	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">acquiescence	 of	 the	 Composer—and,	 when	 they	 were	 drawn	 in	 advance	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">writing,	their	presence	was	always	properly	observed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	revision	became	more	close	and	careful,	the	Composer	directed	that	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">work	be	continued	down-stairs	beside	the	piano.	Here	every	bar	of	the	treble	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">played	 separately	 as	 soon	 as	 edited,	 to	 be	 pronounced	 satisfactory	 by	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Composer,	or	to	be	modified	under	his	direction.	The	treble,	on	its	completion—</p>
<p class="calibre1">eight	 measures—was	 then	 played	 over	 in	 its	 entirety	 and	 pronounced	 by	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Composer	to	be	correct.	(He	made	one	or	two	further	emendations,	however,	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 following	 day.)	 The	 eight	 bars	 of	 the	 bass	 were	 gone	 over	 in	 the	 same</p>
<p class="calibre1">fashion.	 The	 attempt	 to	 play	 the	 entire	 composition,	 treble	 and	 bass,	 was	 not satisfactory,	 partly	 owing	 to	 mechanical	 difficulties	 occasioned	 by	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">distribution	 of	 the	 matter	 on	 the	 slate	 and	 the	 multiplicity	 of	 corrections,	 and partly	 from	 lack	 of	 skill	 in	 the	 performer.	 However,	 two	 or	 three	 very	 brief passages	 were	 given	 by	 both	 hands	 and	 pronounced	 correct	 by	 the	 Composer, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who	showed	surprise	that	anything	so	"  <i class="calibre4">simple</i>"—as	he	characterized	it—should give	so	much	trouble.	In	one	instance	he	noted	that,	while	the	two	parts,	treble</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	bass,	were	correct	separately,	they	were	not	played	in	correct	time	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p175"></a>The	 Composer,	 throughout,	 was	 most	 patient,	 persevering,	 courteous,	 and encouraging,	 though	 toward	 the	 end—in	 the	 closing	 measures	 of	 the	 bass—he</p>
<p class="calibre1">showed	 some	 confusion	 and	 uncertainty.	 "  <i class="calibre4">Wait	 a	 moment</i>,"	 he	 would	 say;	 and once	the	whisper	asked	that,	as	an	aid	to	sight,	the	editor's	hand	be	spread	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	leaf	of	the	slate	on	which	work	was	in	progress.	The	Composer	had	thought, </p>
<p class="calibre1">earlier—and	so	said—that	a	trained	musician	could	easily	supply	the	bass	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	melody.	His	amanuensis	was	obliged	to	acknowledge	frankly	an	inability	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">cope	successfully	with	so	complicated	and	unusual	a	matter.	The	psychic	herself, </p>
<p class="calibre1">though	 expressing	 a	 fondness	 for	 the	 opera,	 disclaimed	 any	 knowledge	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">musical	notation,	and	added	that	never	before	had	she	performed	such	a	function</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	at	present. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 the	 work	 of	 correction	 progressed,	 the	 Composer	 several	 times	 asked	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1">opportunity	 to	 make	 the	 changes	 himself;	 whereupon	 the	 pencil-tip	 would	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">enclosed	 in	 the	 slate	 and	 satisfactory	 emendations	 be	 forthcoming.	 In	 cases</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	 corrections	 were	 made	 by	 the	 writer,	 the	 Composer	 often	 watched	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">progress	of	the	slate-pencil	(a	longer	one	than	that	which	was	used	between	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaves)	and	gave	directions:	"  <i class="calibre4">Not	there</i>";	"  <i class="calibre4">Yes,	here</i>,"	and	the	like;	and	he	would often	acknowledge	a	correction	with	a	"  <i class="calibre4">Thank	you</i>,"	or	meet	a	suggestion	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">Yes,	if	you	please</i>."	On	these	occasions	the	slate	was	some	four	feet	distant	from the	psychic,	and	practically	out	of	her	sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Repeated	 attempts	 were	 made	 on	 both	 sides	 to	 get	 down	 the	 name	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">composition.	Various	related	versions	of	the	word	appeared,	none	of	them	quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">satisfactory.	The	Composer	seemed	to	acquiesce	in	our	attempts	to	relate	his	title</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 different	 Slavic	 and	 Italian	 words	 for	 "gypsy,"	 but	 no	 importance	 can	 be attached,	of	course,	to	such	a	piece	of	direct	suggestion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	final	version	of	this	brief	but	laborious	score	has	been	preserved,	and	all	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">stages	 in	 its	 progress	 have	 been	 abundantly	 annotated.	 To	 follow	 it	 through	 in detail,	however,	would	be	but	weariness.	All	the	salient	points	in	its	production</p>
<p class="calibre1">fall	 under	 one	 of	 three	 heads.	 There	 are,	 first,	 the	 passages	 that	 seem	 to	 have been	 produced	 in	 co-operation	 with	 the	 sitters.	 There	 are,	 second,	 the	 passages that	 seem	 to	 have	 been	 produced	 in	 independence	 of	 the	 sitters.	 And	 there	 are, third,	 the	 passages	 that	 seem	 to	 have	 been	 produced	 in	 direct	 opposition	 to	 the sitters.	Examples	of	all	three	classes	follow;	perhaps	only	those	of	the	third	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">last	class	are	really	important. </p>
<p class="calibre1">1.	 The	 Composer	 in	 Co-operation.	 The	 piece,	 in	 three	 sharps,	 opened	 on	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tonic,	yet	the	very	first	note	in	the	bass	was	a	G-sharp.	The	following	colloquy</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p176"></a>ensued:	 Editor:	 "Does	 the	 piece	 begin	 with	 the	 tonic	 chord	 of	 A?"	 Composer:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">Yes. </i>"	Editor:	"Is	the	G-sharp,	then,	to	be	regarded	as	a	suspension?"	Composer:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">Of	course.	That	makes	it	right.	How	could	it	be	correct	otherwise? </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	 example.	 In	 the	 second	 bar	 a	 note	 which	 the	 editor	 had	 taken	 for	 an eighth-note	 was	 explained	 by	 the	 Composer	 as	 being	 a	 grace-note.	 The	 editor</p>
<p class="calibre1">pointed	 out	 that	 this	 left	 only	 five	 eighth-notes	 to	 fill	 a	 six-eight	 measure.	 The Composer	directed	the	insertion	of	an	eighth-rest	at	the	beginning	of	the	bar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 fourth	 bar	 there	 was	 a	 partial	 chord,	 E-B—a	 fifth.	 The	 Composer's</p>
<p class="calibre1">attention	 was	 drawn	 to	 this	 blemish.	 He	 requested	 the	 insertion	 of	 a	 G-sharp between,	thus	completing	his	triad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 the	 above	 examples,	 and	 others	 which	 might	 be	 related,	 are	 not	 without</p>
<p class="calibre1">resemblances	to	thought	transference. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2.	 The	 Composer	 in	 Independence.	 Under	 this	 head	 may	 be	 placed	 his	 various</p>
<p class="calibre1">instructions	 relative	 to	 tempo,	 expression,	 and	 the	 like.	 The	 signature,	 three sharps,	was	set	down	by	the	editor,	as	the	result	of	an	answer	to	his	inquiry.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 time—six-eight—was	 written	 in	 (on	 the	 editor's	 request)	 by	 the	 Composer</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself.	It	was	a	distinct	and	separate	effort,	for	which	the	pencil	was	put	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">slate	 and	 the	 slate	 placed	 beneath	 the	 table.	 The	 time	 was	 set	 down	 before	 the notes	themselves	were	secured.	The	six-eight	sign	was	clearly	and	neatly	written</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	proper	staff,	in	correct	relation	to	the	G-clef	and	to	the	signature;	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">two	figures	were	also	in	correct	relation	to	each	other.	The	word	"Moderato"	was written	 in	 by	 the	 Composer's	 direction,	 without	 any	 request	 from	 the	 editor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later,	the	words	"With	feeling"	and	the	mark	of	expression	"pp,"	were	obtained in	the	same	way.	Ties,	grace-notes,	and	staccato-marks	were	insisted	upon,	here</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	there,	with	great	vigor	and	earnestness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	 further	 examples	 of	 the	 Composer's	 independence	 will	 perhaps	 suffice.	 In</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 sixth	 measure	 there	 was	 a	 run	 of	 three	 eighth-notes	 in	 the	 treble,	 exactly above	 a	 corresponding	 run	 of	 three	 eighth-notes	 in	 the	 bass.	 In	 making	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">revision	the	Composer	directed	that	each	of	these	three	pairs	of	notes	should	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">joined	by	stems.	This	took	the	treble	notes	down	to	the	bass,	and	left	the	last	half</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	treble	bar	empty—a	fact	unnoticed	by	the	editor	and	beyond	the	purview</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 psychic.	 The	 Composer,	 however,	 observed	 the	 hiatus,	 and	 directed	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">insertion	of	two	rests. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	other	instance:	The	bar	at	the	end	of	the	first	measure,	as	originally	drawn</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	 the	 Composer,	 cut	 off	 two	 notes	 on	 leger-lines	 and	 gave	 them	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p177"></a>succeeding	measure.	Another	little	colloquy:	Editor:	"Shall	I	draw	the	bar	where it	 belongs?"	 Composer:	 "  <i class="calibre4">Yes,	 if	 you	 please. </i>"	 Editor:	 "Here?"	 Composer:	 "  <i class="calibre4">No. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Editor:	"There?"	Composer:	"  <i class="calibre4">Yes.	Thank	you. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">3.	 The	 Composer	 in	 Opposition.	 Numerous	 interesting	 cases	 of	 cross-purposes</p>
<p class="calibre1">between	 the	 Composer	 and	 the	 circle	 developed	 during	 these	 two	 days.	 A</p>
<p class="calibre1">number	of	salient	examples	follow:</p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	first	opening	of	the	slate,	the	seventh	measure	of	the	treble	contained	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">two	notes,	which	the	Composer	presently	declared	to	be	quarter-notes.	This	left</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	first	third	of	the	measure	vacant;	and	the	Composer,	interrogated,	directed	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">insertion	of	a	quarter-rest.	The	editor	objected	that	this	gave	the	measure	a	three-</p>
<p class="calibre1">quarter	 look,	 instead	 of	 the	 proper	 six-eighth	 look.	 "  <i class="calibre4">That	 is	 a	 liberty	 I	 take</i>," </p>
<p class="calibre1">came	the	answer,	like	a	flash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 one	 stage	 the	 Composer	 requested	 that	 a	 certain	 note	 should	 have	 a	 "dot" </p>
<p class="calibre1">added.	 The	 editor	 placed	 the	 dot	 to	 the	 right	 of	 the	 note,	 thus	 lengthening	 its value	 by	 one-half.	 "  <i class="calibre4">No,	 no</i>,"	 objected	 the	 Composer;	 "  <i class="calibre4">put	 it	 on	 top,	 above	 the</i> <i class="calibre4">staff</i>."	His	intention	had	been,	once	more,	to	make	a	note	"staccato,"	and	he	had been	misunderstood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 editor,	 in	 setting	 down	 the	 signature	 of	 sharps	 on	 the	 second	 page	 of	 the slate,	intentionally	placed	the	last	sharp	a	third	below	its	proper	position.	He	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	once	brought	to	book	by	"Dr.	Cooke,"	the	"control."	"  <i class="calibre4">We	are	being	fair	by	you,</i> <i class="calibre4">and	you	must	be	fair	by	us. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 eighth	 and	 last	 measure,	 which	 did	 not	 appear	 to	 be	 satisfactorily</p>
<p class="calibre1">completed,	 the	 Composer	 called	 for	 the	 insertion	 of	 a	 figure	 2.	 This	 meant,	 as became	clear	enough	through	a	subsequent	reference	to	his	published	scores,	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	wished	two	quarter-notes	to	receive	the	value	of	three	eighth-notes,	but	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 understood	 at	 the	 time	 by	 his	 helper.	 "  <i class="calibre4">Never	 mind</i>,"	 said	 the	 Composer, graciously,	"  <i class="calibre4">I	will	write	it	differently</i>."	He	cancelled	the	figure	2,	and	completed the	measure	with	a	rest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 similar	 instance	 occurred	 in	 the	 fifth	 measure,	 where	 the	 Composer	 called</p>
<p class="calibre1">insistently	for	a	double	sharp	(×).	The	editor	ventured	to	object,	and	the	passage</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	tried	on	the	piano,	at	the	Composer's	request.	The	double	sharp	was	felt	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	 to	 be	 unsatisfactory,	 and	 was	 sacrificed.	 "  <i class="calibre4">It	 won't	 make	 much	 difference,</i> <i class="calibre4">anyway</i>,"	was	his	whispered	comment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 curious	 point,	 to	 finish	 with:	 On	 the	 first	 day	 the	 editor	 inquired	 about</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p178"></a>doubtful	 notes	 by	 name,	 as,	 A,	 C-sharp,	 and	 the	 like,	 while	 the	 Composer indicated	 their	 position	 by	 specifying	 lines	 and	 spaces—as,	 third	 space,	 second line,	and	so	on.	The	next	day,	when	the	editor	made	his	inquiries	on	the	basis	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">lines	and	spaces,	the	Composer	oftenest	named	the	notes	by	letter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Toward	the	end	of	the	last	sitting,	"Dr.	Cooke"	once	again	came	to	the	fore	and hinted	 that	 the	 result	 of	 our	 endeavors	 might	 perhaps	 be	 not	 a	 reproduction	 of one	 of	 the	 Composer's	 manuscripts,	 but	 of	 a	 mental	 picture	 in	 the	 Composer's mind.	 The	 "picture,"	 as	 secured	 by	 us,	 was	 not,	 it	 must	 be	 admitted,	 without distortion.	The	Composer	himself	used	the	word	"scattered"	in	such	a	way	as	to imply	that	he	had	sketched	out	his	ideas	in	life	on	various	detached	bits	of	paper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	added	 that	 a	 certain	 member	 of	 his	 family	 "would	 know."	 The	 hopes	 raised by	this	declaration	have	not	been	realized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">No	more	music	to-day</i>,"	whispered	"Dr.	Cooke";	and	the	sitting—the	sittings—</p>
