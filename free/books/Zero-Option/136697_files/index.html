<p class="calibre1">ZERO-OPTION	by	Lindsay	Brambles</p>
<p class="calibre1">Introduction:</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wrote	Zero-Option	back	in	the	eighties	on	a	Commodore	64	using	a	great	little wordprocessor	called	Paperclip.	For	a	few	years	it	just	languished	while	I worked	on	other	things,	including	what	would	eventually	become	In	Darkness Bound	(ISBN	1-4241-6560-1),	my	novel	now	available	from	PublishAmerica (www.publishamerica.com)	and	as	of	April	2007	in	wider	release	to	bookstores and	online	retailers	like	Amazon.com	and	Barnes&amp;Noble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zero-Option	is	about	forty	thousands	words,	which	puts	it	in	the	novella category.	I	had	thought	of	expanding	it	into	a	book,	but	in	going	over	it	I	realized that	would	probably	just	make	it	bloated	and	weaken	the	story.	Everything	that needs	to	be	in	there	is,	and	adding	more	would	just	be	deadweight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	story	is	essentially	told	from	the	perspective	of	Commander	Nathan Imbrahim,	but	it	is	really	about	Captain	Lhara	Jhordel.	The	same	Lhara	Jhordel who	is	an	ensign	in	my	novel	In	Darkness	Bound.	This	story	you’re	about	to read,	however,	takes	place	about	four	decades	after	events	in	the	novel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	original	version	of	this	story	was	submitted	in	competition	at	the	1989</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pinecone	II	Science	Fiction	Convention	and	won	first	place.	As	such,	I	think rather	fondly	of	it,	and	despite	the	fact	that	some	years	have	passed	since	then,	I believe	it	holds	up	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	you	enjoy	this	story	I	hope	you’ll	check	out www.freewebs.com/lindsaybrambles	for	information	on	In	Darkness	Bound.	The latter	is	set	in	the	same	universe	and	once	again	involves	Fleet.	It’s	a	war	novel of	the	future	and	Lhara	Jhordel	figures	prominently	in	it.	Within	the	context	of that	story	you	get	to	see	how	she	became	the	officer	she	is	in	this	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p3"></a>This	story	and	others,	as	well	as	several	novels	in	various	stages	of	completion (the	sequel	to	In	Darkness	Bound	is	all	but	finished)	are	intended	to	create	a	sort of	‘future	history,’	hence	the	Chronicles	of	the	Earth	Empire	heading	above. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether	they	will	see	completion	and	publication	will	essentially	be	up	to	you, the	paying	public.	It	takes	a	lot	of	time	and	effort	to	write	books,	and	though	I get	immense	pleasure	out	of	doing	so,	that	does	not,	unfortunately,	pay	the	bills. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	I	encourage	you	to	read	this	story	and	hope	you’ll	be	encouraged	to	seek	out and	buy	In	Darkness	Bound.	If	I	can	sell	enough	copies	of	that	book	I	may	be able	to	push	on	with	getting	out	the	next	one—providing	my	publisher	considers it	worthy	of	publication. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	now	I	leave	you	to	Zero-Option.	Happy	reading. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lindsay	H.F.	Brambles,	Ottawa,	2007</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p4"></a><b class="calibre3">1. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">He	realized	he’d	made	an	error	in	assuming	the	holos	he’d	seen	of	her	were old	recordings.	An	understandable	mistake,	given	that	the	woman	seated	at	the desk	in	the	office	seemed	far	too	young	to	be	the	notorious	Captain	Jhordel.	He stepped	back	a	pace	and	re-examined	the	ID	plate	beside	the	hatch,	then	looked again	at	the	woman	who	was	engrossed	in	the	contents	of	a	com-link	file.	He would	have	believed	her	a	junior	officer	but	for	the	braid	on	each	of	her epaulettes:	four	silver	bands	on	each	shoulder	to	mark	her	rank	as	ship’s	master. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	slight,	to	the	point	of	almost	seeming	delicate,	and	looked	as	though she	could	not	have	been	more	than	thirty.	But	rejuv	could	make	a	woman	of sixty	look	half	those	years.	Often	there	were	telltale	signs,	but	Jhordel	had	none of	them.	No	faint	discoloration	to	the	whites	of	her	eyes.	None	of	the	unusual blush	to	the	skin.	And	her	face	did	not	have	that	pasty,	fleshy,	baby-soft	look	that some	rejuvs	acquired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	going	to	stand	out	there	all	day,	Commander?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	started,	glanced	up	at	her	and	blinked.	She	gave	him	a	measured	look	in return,	clearly	sizing	him	up	with	that	one	quick	survey.	He	cleared	his	throat and	stepped	forward.	“Commander	Nathan	Imbrahim,”	he	said,	snapping	off	a quick	salute.	“Naval	Intelligence.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	expected	her	to	laugh	and	make	the	tired	old	joke	about	Naval	Intelligence being	an	oxymoron.	But	she	merely	frowned	and	examined	him	again,	more closely,	thoroughly,	and	then	seemed	to	dismiss	him	altogether.	She	turned	back to	the	com-link. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sit,”	she	said	gruffly,	not	looking	up.	There	was	steel	in	that	order;	and	it	was immediately	clear	to	him	she	was	not	the	sort	to	countenance	disobedience.	So he	sat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	voice,	he	noted,	was	thick,	hoarse,	like	she	had	been	inhaling	smoke	for	a few	hours.	Or	shouting.	Probably	from	the	drugs,	he	thought	as	he	settled	into the	lone	seat	across	from	her.	He	knew	the	FS	Confederation	had	just	returned from	a	raiding	mission	deep	inside	Unity	space.	He’d	seen	the	scars	when	he’d come	in	from	Earth	orbit	on	board	the	flitter.	Black	blemishes,	peppering	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p5"></a>surface	of	the	white	hull	like	some	sort	of	fungal	disease.	Laser	blasts,	mostly, though	there	was	evidence	the	shields	had	had	to	absorb	more	than	one	hit	from antimatter	torps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	absently	rubbed	at	her	neck,	revealing	a	red,	perfectly	symmetrical</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘hickey’	beneath	the	high	collar	of	her	jacket.	He	had	expected	to	see	it,	but	still a	chill	ran	through	him.	He	found	himself	probing	self-consciously	at	the	side	of his	own	neck,	running	his	fingertips	over	the	bump	that	was	still	there,	where	a few	weeks	earlier	he’d	borne	his	own	such	mark.	For	spacers	it	was	like	a	badge of	honor,	which	they	wore	proudly	wherever	they	went.	It	was	the	mark	of	the spacers.	And	on	those	who	did	the	deep	runs,	it	was	essentially	permanent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel’s	was	such	a	mark,	showing	signs	of	recent	exposure	to	the	bite	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘pumps.’	It	looked	as	though	it	might	bleed;	and	that	said	much	about	the	battle she	and	her	crew	had	just	been	through.	A	rough	one,	he	ventured.	They	would have	been	hooked	into	the	system	for	long	cycles,	bound	to	those	horrid	metal leeches	that	attached	to	your	neck	as	though	they	were	part	of	your	flesh, sucking	blood	from	you	and	pumping	it	back	in.	On	the	return	the	blood	was	rich with	oxygen	and	primed	with	a	virtual	pharmacopoeia.	All	necessary,	if	you wanted	to	stay	alive	while	the	g-forces	within	the	ship—despite	the	gravity dispensators—reached	extremes	that	would	render	the	unprotected	human lifeless	in	seconds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shuddered	when	he	recalled	what	it	felt	like,	and	wondered	how	they	could do	it,	time	and	time	again.	He	had	never	grown	used	to	it,	despite	his	many jumps;	but	men	and	women	like	Jhordel	went	on	doing	it	again	and	again, running	the	ship	while	being	crushed	into	the	cocoon	of	bladders	that	surrounded each,	and	kept	conscious	by	a	battery	of	drugs	and	mechanisms	that	left	one	sick and	sore	and	feeling	like	the	living	dead	long	after	the	fighting	had	stopped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	went	out	there	into	the	deeps	of	space	and	rained	down	destruction	upon the	enemy	without	complaint,	seemingly	oblivious	of	the	incredible	forces	that threatened	life	itself,	treating	such	threats	as	though	they	were	simply	a	fact	of life,	and	enduring	the	ghastly	nightmare	of	pain	that	was	almost	routine	on	a fighting	ship.	He	supposed	that	spacers	became	accustomed	to	such	things;	but he	never	could,	having	spent	much	of	his	life	rooted	to	one	planet	or	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	that	he	looked	more	closely,	he	could	see	the	slight	bruising	around	the captain’s	eyes,	and	recalled	looking	at	his	own	face	in	a	mirror	after	one particularly	long	skirmish.	He	hadn’t	recognized	himself:	bloodshot	eyes,	puffy</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p6"></a>flesh,	the	bruising—as	though	he	had	taken	part	in	a	drunken	brawl.	It	had	been frightening	the	first	time,	and	after	that	he	had	never	been	anxious	to	look	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	must	have	been	in	a	long	battle,	he	thought,	given	that	they’d	already	had	a few	days	to	recover. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	sent	in	my	report	to	Intelligence,”	Jhordel	observed,	at	last	glancing	up from	the	com-link	cube	and	addressing	him	directly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	here	about	the	report,	sir,”	he	said.	From	where	he	sat	the	script	in	the cube	was	backwards,	but	he’d	become	quite	adept	at	reading	from	this	vantage point	and	knew	she	was	preoccupied	with	data	concerning	the	welfare	of	her ship.	Natural	enough	after	a	return	from	battle,	he	mused	to	himself;	and	she doubtless	didn’t	appreciate	that	Admiralty	seemed	little	concerned	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	eyed	him	warily.	“We’ve	just	spent	three	months	out	patrolling	the	line,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	said.	The	‘line’	was	the	Pomerium	Line,	a	semi-official	boundary	between Federation	and	Unity	space.	“We’re	back	in	port	less	than	a	day	and	Admiralty tells	me	I	have	to	be	ready	to	sail	within	a	six-shift,	but	doesn’t	tell	me	why.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	eyes	narrowed,	an	unspoken	accusation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	took	Imbrahim	a	moment	to	recall	that	a	six-shift	was	forty-eight	hours:	six eight	hour	periods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	patience	is	thin,	Commander,	so	I	suggest	you	tell	me	why	you’re	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since	it’s	not	about	the	report,	I	assume	it	has	something	to	do	with	this	mad rush	to	get	us	back	out	there	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	ran	his	tongue	over	his	lips	and	drew	a	breath.	“Orders,	Captain,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	reached	into	his	shirt	pocket	and	withdrew	a	file-chip,	handed	the	small square	of	metalastic	over	to	her	and	watched	as	she	took	it	and	examined	it	in	a perfunctory	manner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	surely	joking,”	she	growled,	with	all	the	pretense	of	one	who	knew	he was	not.	“We’re	hardly	in	shape	for	‘spooking.’	“</p>
<p class="calibre1">She	set	the	file-chip	down	on	her	desk,	ignoring	it;	and	he	wondered	how someone	claiming	to	be	at	the	edge	of	patience	could	be	so	indifferent	to	its contents.	Her	renowned	discipline,	he	supposed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	isn’t	a	deep-cover	mission,”	he	assured	her—though	he	reflected	on</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a>how	that	wasn’t	altogether	true. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	detected	a	hint	of	curiosity	in	her	eyes,	but	it	was	held	well	in	check	by that	same	discipline	he	found	unnerving.	He	wasn’t	sure	he	liked	the	thought	of having	to	serve	on	this	ship	under	this	captain.	She	was	too	reserved,	too	cold, too	much	a	part	of	this	vessel	of	hers.	She	could	have	been	a	machine;	and	he was	inclined	to	think	it	must	have	something	to	do	with	the	fact	that	she	was from	Tartarus.	There	were	rumors,	though,	that	it	had	something	to	do	with	an event	in	her	past,	on	her	first	mission.	Something	that	had	happened	to	her	on some	backwater	planet	out	on	the	Fringes.	But	that	sort	of	thing	was	kept	in	a closed	file.	Admiralty	would	have	told	him	if	he	had	needed	to	know.	They hadn’t,	so	clearly	he	didn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hope	this	isn’t	a	courier	mission,”	she	said	with	evident	disgust.	“I	find	it difficult	to	believe	Admiralty	would	pull	a	ship	of	the	line	out	of	service	when we	need	every	one	we	can	get	out	fighting	the	Unity.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	file-chip,	sir,”	was	all	he	would	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	at	him	sharply	and	grunted.	But	she	picked	up	the	square	and dropped	it	in	the	com-link	slot.	The	script	that	had	floated	in	the	cube	vanished, replaced	by	new	tracts,	which	glowed	an	angry	red	as	they	hovered	in	the	air above	her	desk.	She	read	them	quickly,	the	scowl	on	her	face	growing	darker, until	at	last	she	looked	up	at	Imbrahim	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	a	war	on,	commander,”	she	said	simply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ships	disappear	all	the	time.	From	battle.	From	poor	phase-shifts.	Sometimes in	shift.	Any	number	of	things	can	happen	to	you	out	there.	When	someone doesn’t	report	in,	it’s	hardly	cause	to	go	traipsing	out	there	after	them.	Especially not	with	something	like	the	Connie.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	it	were	any	other	ship,	I	might	be	inclined	to	agree	with	you,”	Imbrahim said.	“Though	to	be	honest,	sir,	I	rather	hope	someone	would	come	looking	for me	out	there	if	I	were	long	overdue.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	said	nothing,	but	merely	stared,	waiting	for	him	to	continue.	Waiting	for him	to	explain. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>“What	the	report	I	gave	you	doesn’t	say,	and	what	the	Navy	doesn’t	want commonly	known,	is	that	it	was	the	Niagara	that	disappeared,	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	visibly	stiffened,	but	said,	“The	Niagara	was	fresh	out	of	the	slips.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	was	a	lot	of	untried	technology	on	board,”	she	added,	as	though	that might	explain	everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	broke	Earth	orbit	a	little	more	than	two	weeks	ago	on	its	shakedown cruise,”	he	agreed.	“And	it’s	possible	something	might	have	gone	wrong.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	not	send	out	a	probe?	Cheaper,	faster,	and	just	as	effective.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	already	done	that,	sir.	Twice.”	And	she	had	almost	certainly	guessed that,	he	told	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	relaxed	and	slowly	sat	back	in	her	chair.	“I	take	it	you	found	nothing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	know	we	didn’t.	“The	results	were	less	substantial	than	that,”	he confessed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	lost	your	probes,”	she	said,	a	smile	quirking	the	corners	of	her	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	felt	the	heat	of	irritation,	annoyed	she	could	see	anything	even	remotely amusing	about	the	situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Forgive	me,	Commander,”	she	apologized,	reading	the	look	on	his	face.	“I don’t	mean	to	make	light	of	the	situation,	but	despite	your	revelation,	I	still	find it	difficult	to	get	all	worked	up	about	this.”	Her	features	hardened.	“I’ve	seen	too many	good	people	die	out	there	to	shed	tears	for	any	more.	Besides,	everyone remembers	the	Phoenix.	This	merely	could	be	more	of	the	same.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	may	have	been	young	for	a	captain	of	her	experience,	but	the	war,	he decided,	had	made	her	very	old	indeed.	He	realized	she	was	much	like	the masters	of	the	other	warships	he’d	served	on,	though	if	anything	she	was tougher,	harder,	and	perhaps	a	shade	more	cynical.	He	was	older	than	she,	but somehow	in	her	presence	he	felt	her	junior.	He	felt	the	way	he	had	always	felt	in the	presence	of	his	father,	and	it	was	a	feeling	of	intimidation	he	didn’t	like	at</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	me,	Commander,”	she	said,	regarding	him	shrewdly;	“since	it	seems Intelligence	doesn’t	believe	the	Niagara	had	a	simple	systems	failure	that resulted	in	its	destruction,	just	what	do	you	think	happened	to	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shrugged.	“There	are	a	lot	of	theories,”	he	said.	“Some	insist	it	must	have been	the	Reds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Unity?”	Jhordel	snorted	and	shook	her	head.	“That’s	quite	far	out	from Unity	space.	And	since	the	captain	of	a	class	ship	is	under	orders	to	conduct random	jumps	during	a	shakedown,	I	find	it	difficult	to	believe	the	Unity	could have	predicted	where	the	ship	would	have	been	at	any	given	moment.	No,”—she shook	her	head	again—“I	can’t	see	the	Red	Catholic	Church	wasting	precious resources	that	far	beyond	the	Fringes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Which	means	you	don’t	think	we	should	either,	he	thought;	and	he	wasn’t	sure he	disagreed	with	her.	He	was	inclined	to	subscribe	to	the	theory	that	the	Niagara had	simply	been	a	victim	of	technology.	Something	new	that	hadn’t	worked quite	the	way	it	should	have.	On	the	other	hand,	there	was	still	the	possibility	it was	out	there	somewhere,	relatively	intact.	There	might	be	people	still	alive	on board,	waiting	to	be	rescued.	And	even	if	there	weren’t,	the	Navy	needed	to know	what	had	happened,	just	so	the	same	thing	wouldn’t	happen	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	also	the	possibility	that	it’s	some	kind	of	natural	phenomenon,”	he found	himself	saying.	“Possibly	something	in	the	transit	lines	of	the	Matrix.	The last	reported	jump	was	through	the	Rigar	Transit	Point.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	the	probes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shifted	uncomfortably,	because,	of	course,	that	was	one	of	the	holes	in	the theory.	“The	probes	were	sent	from	Msatas	Transit	Point,”	he	told	her reluctantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rigar	and	Msatas	have	both	been	used	for	years	without	incident,”	Jhordel said.	“If	there’s	a	problem,	it	would	have	to	be	at	the	other	end.”	She	looked	at him	squarely	and	added,	“Which	doesn’t	bode	well	for	anyone	following	the Niagara	and	the	probes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	it	doesn’t,”	he	agreed,	his	voice	tight. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>“Does	Admiralty	have	some	bold	plan	for	how	we’re	going	to	make	the	jump and	avoid	a	similar	fate?”	she	asked	with	a	touch	of	sarcasm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	swallowed	and	grimaced.	“They	do,	Captain,	but	I	don’t	think	you’re going	to	like	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a><b class="calibre3">2. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	them,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	looked	around	at	the	faces	of	the	other	officers	assembled	in	the Confederation’s	briefing	room	and	thought	he	sensed	a	degree	of	hostility	in their	eyes.	He	told	himself	he	was	wrong,	that	it	was	only	paranoia,	that	he	was just	letting	his	own	insecurities	get	the	better	of	him.	He	wasn’t	a	spacers.	Not	in their	eyes,	at	least.	And	that	set	him	apart	from	them;	he	didn’t	belong	in	their world.	Consequently,	they	didn’t	trust	him	as	they	would	one	of	their	own.	But they	couldn’t	possibly	hate	him,	or	really	have	feelings	about	him	one	way	or	the other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Except	that	I’m	Naval	Intelligence,	he	reminded	himself;	and	nobody	in	the regular	navy	cared	for	Jackson’s	lackeys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	could	forego	the	transit	point	and	make	a	blind	jump,”	he	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can’t	be	serious,”	said	Wethers,	the	first	officer.	“Even	doing	skip	jumps involves	an	element	of	risk.	And	they’re	only	short	distances.	You’re	talking about	light-years	of	phase-shifting	outside	of	the	Matrix.	Two	hundred	and	fifty light-years	beyond	the	Fringes,	as	a	matter-of-fact.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	agree.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	glanced	over	at	the	navigation	officer,	Seria	Talud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	the	Matrix	we’re	pretty	well	guaranteed	safe	passage,”	she	continued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	use	of	transit	points	has	made	interstellar	travel	much	more	efficient	and safe.	There’s	little	fear	of	passing	through	a	planet	or	a	sun	or	dropping	out	into one.	The	lines	we	use	are	generally	clear	of	mass	and	debris.	Blind	phase-shifting	doesn’t	guarantee	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	it	was	practiced	for	more	than	two	centuries	after	the	development	of	the Pearson	FTL,”	Imbrahim	reminded	them	all.	“I	grant	you	that	use	of	transit points	is	preferable,	but	the	only	two	points	that	connect	to	the	sector	we	need	to jump	to	are	suspect.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>“It’s	possible	to	drop	shift	before	you	reach	the	exit	point	on	a	given	line	in the	Matrix,”	said	Talud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	the	risks	are	no	less	substantial	than	blind	shifting,”	Imbrahim	argued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dropping	shift	from	within	the	Matrix	means	an	unsighted	exit.	Even	our	best efforts	can’t	predict	an	exact	entry	into	sublight	space.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	enamored	of	either	suggestion,”	Wethers	grunted.	“They’re	both	too bloody	risky.	And	if	there	are	Unity	out	there	waiting	for	the	next	ship	to	come down	the	pike,	we	might	not	be	in	any	shape	to	defend	ourselves	against	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dropping	shift	blind	or	using	the	old	conventional	methods	could	put	a	lot	of strain	on	the	ship.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	to	mention	the	crew,”	interjected	the	chief	medical	officer.	N’robo	gave Imbrahim	a	sullen	look,	and	there	was	a	hint	of	indictment	in	his	eyes.	“We’ve just	come	off	three	months	of	an	intense	patrol,	Commander.	We	took	a	beating out	there.	The	crew	is	tired	physically	and	emotionally.	The	Navy	has	no	right expecting	us	to	go	right	back	out	there	without	a	decent	respite.	We’re	all	need of	some	much-deserved	shore	leave.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	appreciate	that,	doctor,”	the	Intelligence	officer	assured	him.	“And	believe me,	if	there	were	any	choice	we’d	use	another	ship.	But	yours	is	the	only	one available.	Every	other	suitable	warship	in	Fleet	is	either	out	on	duty	or	in	the dock	for	repairs.	It’s	true	we	could	call	someone	else	off	the	line,	but	that	would mean	more	delay.	You’re	here,	now.	And	now	is	when	we	need	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	we	wouldn’t	want	to	inconvenience	to	Naval	Intelligence,	would	we?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	drawled	acerbically.	“And	I	don’t	suppose	the	fact	that	if	you	re-directed another	ship	you	wouldn’t	be	able	to	have	one	of	your	people	on	board” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	blinked	at	her,	but	knew	it	would	be	fruitless	feigning	innocence	in the	matter.	“There’s	that,	too,”	he	agreed,	smiling	thinly.	“Naval	Intelligence	has taken	a	keen	interest	in	this	matter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?”	someone	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	if	the	Unity	is	behind	it,	they	may	have	some	new	weapon	we should	know	about,”	he	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you	don’t	think	it	is	the	Unity,”	said	Jhordel	in	a	blunted	tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>He	hesitated.	“No,”	he	admitted,	reluctantly,	“we	don’t.	If	they’d	such	a weapon,	it	isn’t	likely	they’d	be	using	it	out	there.	Nor	does	it	seem	likely	they could’ve	known	the	Niagara	or	the	probes	were	going	to	be	coming	through	the point	in	that	sector.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	what	does	that	leave	us	with?”	asked	Wethers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Natural	phenomena,”	Imbrahim	offered.	“Which	is	another	reason	for caution	when	approaching	this	matter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	if	it	isn’t	something	natural?”	asked	N’robo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	shifted	uncomfortably.	“Then	it	may	be	something	we’ve	stumbled upon	that	we’d	rather	we	hadn’t,”	he	muttered. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a><b class="calibre3">3. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	not	telling	me	everything,”	said	Jhordel.	She	gave	him	a	sharp	look, suggesting	by	that	glower	that	she	wouldn’t	accept	prevarication. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	sure	I	know	what	you	mean,”	he	said	innocently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	jaw	line	hardened.	“I	think	you	know	perfectly	well	what	I	mean, commander.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	swallowed.	They	were	alone	again,	the	others	having	been	dismissed	from the	briefing	room	so	as	to	tend	to	their	duties	in	preparation	for	departure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	looked	around	the	table	at	the	empty	chairs,	purposely	avoiding	her eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	are	some	in	Admiralty	who	believe	we’re	dealing	with	some	new agency,”	he	said	at	length.	He	found	the	courage	to	look	at	her,	and	saw	again the	discipline	that	held	her	in	check	and	kept	her	composed.	It	made	him	shiver and	go	cold	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“New	agency,”	she	echoed.	“I	see.	And	they	believe	this	‘new	agency’	to	be	a threat	to	the	Empire?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Possibly.”	He	gestured	helplessly.	“Which	is	why	there’s	some	concern.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	of	the	information	the	Niagara	was	carrying?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	She	contained	our	latest	developments.	If	someone	got	hold	of	her	they could	find	out	an	awful	lot	about	Fleet	technology.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	see.”	Jhordel	sat	back	in	her	chair	and	rested	one	arm	languidly	on	the briefing	room	table.	“I	take	it	Admiralty	has	sent	you	here	to	ensure	we’ll	do	the right	thing	then,	should	that	become	necessary.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	he	said,	his	voice	strained,	not	much	more	than	a	whisper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	grinned	sardonically	and	shook	her	head.	“And	how	does	that	sit	with you,	Commander?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>“I,	too,	swore	the	oath,	Captain.	I	knew	what	I	was	getting	into	when	I	joined the	Navy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	thought	you	did,”	she	corrected.	“I	know	your	sort,	Commander.	You	got caught	up	in	the	patriotism,	as	so	many	do	when	war	looms	and	we	see	all	that we	value	threatened	by	outside	forces.	But	you	weren’t	gene-typed	a	spacers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	showed	surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed	at	that.	“Come,	Commander,	surely	you	didn’t	honestly	think	it escaped	notice.	It’s	written	all	over	you,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	all	make	choices,	Captain.	I	made	this	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you,	now?	That’s	not	my	understanding	of	how	Jackson	works.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	kept	silent,	not	knowing	what	to	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	must	be	a	latent,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	potential	empathy,	Mister	Imbrahim.	That’s	the	only	way	you	could	do	as many	jumps	as	you	have	without	having	been	born	a	spacers.	And	Jackson wouldn’t	have	been	interested	in	you	otherwise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	very	astute,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	had	practice.”	She	stared	at	him,	then	cocked	an	eyebrow.	“So	can you…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shook	his	head.	“Like	you	say,	Captain,	I’m	a	latent.	The	genetic component	is	there,	somewhere,	but	other	than	letting	me	travel	at	leisure	in space	with	an	implant,	it’s	not	much	good	for	anything	else.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	could	have	refused.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jackson?”	Now	he	laughed.	“Once	I	made	a	choice	to	join	Fleet…”	He shrugged.	“The	admiral	is	not	someone	you	argue	with,	sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	rose	slowly	from	her	seat.	And	though	she	was	not	tall,	she	had	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>commanding	presence.	He	was	reminded	again	of	his	father.	Her	lips	twitched	in a	quirky	little	grin—almost	a	smirk.	“So	now	you	understand,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Understand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	sometimes	our	choices	are	really	not	choices	at	all,	are	they?”	With	that she	turned	from	him	and	left	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	sat	alone	in	the	eerie	silence,	staring	out	the	floor-to-ceiling viewports	that	lined	the	aft	wall	of	the	room.	He	could	see	Earth	in	the	distance, an	enormous	shining	sphere	whose	glow	blocked	out	the	feebler	light	of	a myriad	stars.	For	some	reason	it	was	a	more	stirring	and	poignant	sight	than	it had	ever	been	before.	He	wished	he	were	back	there	instead	of	here;	he	had	the feeling	he’d	perhaps	seen	it	for	the	last	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a><b class="calibre3">4. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	same	ensign	who	had	conducted	him	through	the	maze	of	corridors	to Jhordel’s	office	later	showed	Imbrahim	to	his	cabin	in	officers’	country	on	the accommodations	deck.	The	Confederation,	being	a	frigate	of	recent	vintage, offered	considerably	better	living	quarters	than	the	‘spook’	he’d	last	traveled	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cabin	was	spacious	and	well-appointed,	not	at	all	like	the	Spartan	and cramped	cubbyhole	that	had	been	his	on	the	Aurora	for	three	hellish	weeks.	Of course,	large	ships	like	the	Connie	were	intended	to	spend	months	in	space without	visiting	a	port;	the	‘spooks’	were	purposely	designed	to	be	small	and elusive,	their	missions	seldom	lasting	beyond	two	or	three	weeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More	than	half	the	mass	of	a	ship	like	the	Aurora	was	engine;	and	it	carried few	weapons	other	than	those	necessary	to	safely	navigate	through	the	errant debris	of	space.	Shields	and	sensing	equipment	on	such	vessels	were	the	primary arsenal,	given	that	those	ships	were	designed	for	spying	well	behind	enemy lines.	The	same	properties	that	made	them	suitable	to	this	task	made	them	ideal as	couriers	for	Naval	Intelligence	field	operatives	like	him—which	was	why many	of	his	shipboard	days	had	been	spent	in	the	bowels	of	such	craft. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Confederation,	by	contrast,	was	a	fortress	with	engines.	As	such	it	was less	maneuverable,	less	agile	than	the	Aurora,	but	with	the	power	to	raze	the surface	of	a	planet.	And	even	though	space	on	any	ship	was	at	a	premium,	the Connie	was	closer	to	the	luxury	of	one	of	the	commercial	interstellar	passenger liners	than	it	was	to	the	likes	of	the	Aurora. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under	different	circumstances	he	might	have	reveled	in	the	good	fortune	that had	won	him	an	assignment	on	board	the	Connie.	But	this	was	no	ordinary mission	Admiralty	had	given	him;	and	he	suspected	there	was	nothing	fortuitous in	being	handed	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	dropped	his	kit	into	a	nearby	chair	and	strode	easily	to	the	large	viewport that	filled	a	good	portion	of	the	cabin’s	bow-facing	wall.	From	where	he	stood he	could	see	along	the	spine	of	the	ship,	forward,	towards	the	prow	of	the	frigate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Between	him	and	the	bridge	there	was	an	array	of	weapons,	some	of	them tucked	away,	others,	like	the	laser	cannons,	jutting	forth	threateningly—the sharp,	deadly	spines	of	a	quiescent	beast.	They	were	muted	now,	but	they	had not	so	long	ago	spat	their	fury	into	the	eerie	silences	of	space.	He	felt	some</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>reassurance	in	seeing	them—though	secretly	he	wondered	whether	even	these formidable	armaments	would	be	sufficient	to	the	task	they	were	about	to undertake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	moved	to	the	desk	in	the	corner,	sat	down	and	activated	the	com-link.	The cube	formed	above	the	projector	rods,	a	faintly	blue	field	that	rotated	to	orient itself	towards	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Personnel	information,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Concerning?”	the	AI	requested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jhordel,	Lhara.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Clearance?”	the	machine	queried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	gave	his	security	code,	grateful	his	position	in	Intelligence	provided	him such	easy	access	to	information	that	would	otherwise	have	been	off	limits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Admiralty	might	not	have	thought	it	necessary	he	know	the	truth	about	Jhordel, but	he	was	damned	if	he	was	going	to	go	on	this	mission	in	the	dark.	He	liked	to know	as	much	as	possible	about	the	people	he	might	be	called	upon	to	trust	with his	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jhordel,	Lhara	Annyselia,”	the	AI	intoned	at	length.	It	rattled	off	information he	already	knew:	her	birth	on	Tartarus,	the	ships	she	had	served	on,	the	missions of	which	she’d	been	a	part.	So	many	missions,	in	fact,	that	there	could	have	been two	of	her	and	it	would	still	have	seemed	a	remarkable	career.	But	it	was	the	first that	caught	his	attention.	She’d	been	part	of	the	mission	that	had	started	it	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	one	that	had	started	the	war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Obsidian,”	he	murmured	to	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Obsidian,	where	Grenier	had	made	her	fatal	mistake.	She	had	raised	the	ire	of Red	Catholics	throughout	the	empire,	and	there	had	been	no	turning	back	after that.	The	Red	Catholic	Unity	had	gained	steam	quickly,	spreading	throughout worlds	on	the	Fringes,	then	rapidly	inwards,	towards	the	more	populous	regions of	the	Federation.	The	Unity	had	grown	more	and	more	powerful,	until	Fleet itself	had	been	seriously	threatened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	listened	through	to	the	end	of	the	AI’s	recitation,	but	was	frustrated	to	find</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>that	one	critical	piece	of	data	was	still	blocked.	Whatever	had	happened	to	her on	Obsidian	remained	a	mystery.	Nothing	he	could	do	would	allow	him	to	see the	file	on	that.	Admiralty	was	clearly	determined	it	never	be	known	but	by	a handful.	Or	someone	in	Admiralty	was	so	determined.	Because	now,	as	he looked	over	her	dossier,	he	could	see	a	distinct	pattern	emerging.	Vice-Admiral Carter’s	prints	were	all	over	it.	The	admiral	had	constantly	intervened	in	her career;	it	was	as	though	he	had	made	it	his	personal	mission	to	do	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	pondered	this,	considering	the	many	possibilities,	and	reaching	the conclusion	that	whatever	it	was	that	had	happened	to	her	on	Obsidian	had	had something	to	do	with	the	Reds	and	why	she	seemed	to	hell-bent	on	exacting some	sort	of	revenge.	He	better	understood	her,	he	thought,	despite	the	blacked out	information.	Jhordel’s	recklessness—as	some	would	call	it—was	firmly rooted	in	her	past.	It	was	a	simple	enough	motivation;	and	he	could	sympathize with	her	wholeheartedly.	But	it	was	an	emotional	response,	and	in	his	experience that	was	the	sort	of	thing	that	led	to	mistakes.	And	in	space,	mistakes	got	you killed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	the	episode	that	seemed	to	have	changed	her	life	was	sealed	from scrutiny,	there	was	considerable	information	regarding	the	incident	for	which	she was	publicly	famous—the	one	for	which	she	had	almost	been	court-martialed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	would	have	been,	Imbrahim	thought,	if	not	for	Admiral	Carter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	Imbrahim	much	of	this	information	was	new,	since	he	had	not	been	on Earth	at	the	time	of	the	furor.	By	the	time	he	had	returned,	the	details	had	already become	blurred	by	countless	retellings.	Of	course,	as	far	as	what	had	gone	on	in the	Council	of	the	Admirals,	that	information	had	been	limited	to	the	handful who	had	been	there.	It	wasn’t	counted	among	the	data	the	computer	offered	up for	his	edification.	He	did	know,	however,	that	quite	a	battle	had	been	fought	as to	whether	Jhordel	should	be	demoted	and	denied	future	command.	Some	of	the traditionalists	had	insisted	it	was	the	only	way	of	maintaining	discipline,	but	the more	moderate	element	in	the	Admiralty	had	foreseen	that	such	a	move	would alienate	the	public,	and	consequently	the	politicians	whose	support	the	Navy	so desperately	needed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	smiled	roguishly	as	he	imagined	the	fur	flying	in	that	closed	room	of seasoned	military	strategists.	It	had	long	been	rumored	that	the	Admiral	of	the Fleet	himself,	Silas	Jackson,	had	taken	a	personal	interest	in	the	case	and	had come	down	in	favor	of	Jhordel.	For	that	reason	and	that	reason	alone,	many</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>argued,	Jhordel	had	been	given	the	much	sought	after	and	prized	command	of the	Confederation.	He	thought	it	more	likely	that	Carter	had	played	the	bigger role,	but	Jackson	would	have	gone	along	with	it	because	of	the	flak	he’d	been receiving	at	the	time:	Jhordel’s	success	against	the	Unity	in	her	unprecedented action	had	been	the	first	major	victory	for	the	Federation	in	several	years.	It	had come,	too,	after	a	spate	of	embarrassing	losses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly	in	the	time	that	Jhordel	had	held	command	of	the	Confederation	she had	proven	herself	an	able—and	daring—officer.	Her	ship	and	crew	had	the highest	success	rate	of	any	in	the	fleet;	and	hers	was	currently	the	only	ship given	letters	of	marque	that	allowed	it	to	raid	indiscriminately	beyond	the Pomerium	Line,	deep	in	Unity	space.	Imbrahim	surmised	that	much	of	her success	arose	from	the	ruthlessness	for	which	she	prosecuted	her	missions—a ruthlessness	that	had	garnered	a	considerable	reputation.	And	it	was	probably because	of	this	that	in	the	Unity	they	called	her	‘Satan’s	whore.’	The	Cardinali,	it was	said,	had	put	a	price	on	her	head,	with	a	reward	of	untold	riches	and	an assured	spot	in	the	Heavens	for	the	captain	who	brought	her	down.	From	what he	had	heard	through	the	grapevine,	there	had	been	many	among	the	Unity	fleet who	had	taken	up	the	challenge;	and	what	he	had	seen	of	the	Confederation	as he	had	come	in	from	Earth	had	been	visible	proof.	How	long,	he	wondered, before	someone	succeeded?	Even	the	magnificent	Jhordel,	he	ventured,	was	not invulnerable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Satan’s	whore.	He	found	it	difficult	not	to	smile	at	that;	it	was	easy	to	admire someone	who	could	so	enrage	the	enemy	they	felt	it	necessary	to	single	her	out for	attention.	Clearly	she’d	come	a	long	way	since	that	day	when	she’d evacuated	the	crew	of	the	Grand	Banks	and	primed	it	for	self-destruct.	He	tried to	imagine	what	it	must	have	been	like	for	her	watching	from	the	tenuous	safety of	her	life	pod	as	her	ship	had	hurtled	through	the	black	infinity	of	space,	the defensive	array	of	the	Unity	waystation	pounding	it	mercilessly.	But	not	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	enough.	The	old	Grandy	had	defied	the	odds	and	made	it	through	the	screen of	defenses,	through	the	shields,	where	it	had	unceremoniously	plowed	into	the station.	That	in	itself	would	have	been	enough	to	wreak	havoc;	but	then	the ship’s	auto-destruct	had	done	its	work.	The	graviton	collection	coils	had collapsed	and	the	thing	had	become	a	singularity,	sucking	three	Unity	ships	and the	station	into	its	ever-growing	well	of	gravity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three	ships	and	a	station.	He	shook	his	head	in	awe.	All	with	an	old	scow	that had	been	on	its	last	legs	as	an	offensive	weapon. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>Three	ships	and	a	station.	How	many	lives	had	been	lost	that	day?	he wondered.	How	many	thousands	of	souls	sucked	down	into	that	well	of lightlessness?	It	made	him	shudder;	and	he	wondered	if	he	would	have	been capable	of	such	a	cold	and	calculated	maneuver.	Without	remorse	she	had casually	dispatched	tens	of	thousands	of	lives.	In	all	the	years	he’d	been	a	part	of this	war	he’d	never	actually	killed	anyone.	He’d	never	actually	even	seen	anyone killed.	His	assignments	had	never	involved	that	sort	of	thing.	Naval	Intelligence generally	left	assassination	to	those	best	suited	for	the	task:	the	Empaths.	That was	just	as	well	with	him,	since	he	knew	it	wasn’t	in	his	character	be	so	ruthless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	no	doubts,	however,	that	it	was	well	within	Jhordel’s,	and	that consequently	she	was	the	only	choice	for	this	mission. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a><b class="calibre3">5. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Begging	your	pardon,	sir,”	the	ensign	said	stiffly,	“but	the	captain	requests your	presence	at	her	table	in	the	mess	at	nineteen	hundred	hours.”	He	saluted, then	turned	on	one	heel	and	marched	away	before	Imbrahim	had	a	chance	to respond.	The	commander	stood	in	his	door,	bewildered,	feeling	as	though	he’d just	been	blindsided. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Better	wear	your	dress	togs,”	said	N’robo,	smiling	waggishly	as	he approached	from	down	the	corridor.	“The	skipper	is	particular	about	that	when in	port.”	He	shrugged	and	made	a	noise	through	his	nose.	“I	guess	she	feels	its one	of	the	rare	opportunities	to	feel	civilized	in	all	this	madness.	Thing’s	are considerably	more	relaxed	out	on	patrol.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks	for	the	warning,”	said	Imbrahim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">N’robo	laughed,	his	ebony	face	wrinkling	with	lines	of	mirth.	“Don’t	fret	it	so, Commander.	The	lady	has	a	reputation,	but	believe	me,	she	won’t	bite.	Unless, of	course,	you	get	on	the	wrong	side	of	her.”	He	chortled	loudly,	as	though enjoying	some	private	joke	and	taking	a	particular	delight	in	the	nonplused	look on	Imbrahim’s	face,	then	continued	on	down	the	corridor	to	his	own	cabin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	watched	him	go,	overcome	with	a	greater	sense	of	isolation	than he’d	felt	in	a	long	time.	Once	more	he	was	reminded	he	was	a	stranger	on	this ship,	alone	among	them.	Not	a	spacers.	Not	regular	navy.	Not	even	something they	particularly	liked.	Quite	the	opposite.	He	had	no	doubts	they	looked	upon him	with	a	measure	of	disdain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	withdrew	into	his	cabin	and	prepared	himself	for	dinner,	not	at	all	looking forward	to	the	encounter. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a><b class="calibre3">6. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">On	a	spook	there	was	not	enough	surplus	energy,	nor	the	space	available	to accommodate	a	full-fledged	reconstitutor.	Imbrahim	recalled	meals	as	having been	adequate,	but	far	from	memorable.	Granted,	some	of	that	was	an	internal prejudice	he	had	never	been	able	to	shake:	the	constant	thread	of	background thought	that	always	ran	through	his	mind	as	he	ate	the	stuff,	reminding	him	that the	food	he	was	shoveling	into	his	mouth	had	not	so	long	ago	been	shit.	Some	of it,	anyway,	because	of	course	the	components	for	recycling	came	from	an assortment	of	ship	wastes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fare	on	the	Confederation,	however,	was	worthy	of	anything	the commercial	liners	had	to	offer—even	if	it,	too,	was	partially	composed	of	what had	once	been	the	bodily	discharge	of	one	of	the	thousand	odd	crew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	found	himself	savoring	what	appeared	to	be	veal	marinated	in	a	wine	and mushroom	sauce.	It	had	been	brought	to	them	by	actual	crewmembers,	rather than	servobot.	A	quaint	custom	N’robo	assured	him	was,	like	the	wearing	of dress	uniforms,	strictly	reserved	for	in-port	occasions	like	this.	Imbrahim	didn’t really	care;	the	smell	of	the	food	had	reminded	him	that	it	had	been	some	time since	he	had	last	eaten. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	taste	of	the	meal	matched	the	aroma.	Candied	carrots,	scallop	potatoes, and	snow	peas	supplemented	the	meat	dish,	providing	a	repast	of	a	sort	he	hadn’t enjoyed	in	some	time.	N’robo,	who	sat	to	his	right,	informed	him	the	vegetables were	the	real	thing,	having	come	from	Earthside	in	a	resupply	shipment	just	that day.	The	veal,	however,	was	clearly	not	the	real	McCoy.	Not	because	it	tasted artificial,	but	because	no	one	had	eaten	‘real’	meat	on	Earth	in	more	than	two centuries.	He	had	no	idea	as	to	whether	or	not	the	reconstituted	cutlet	he	was devouring	with	gusto	approximated	the	actual	flavor	of	veal	or	not.	All	he	knew was	that	it	was	surprisingly	good	for	something	that	had	once	gone	down	a	toilet into	a	separation	unit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	glad	to	see	our	culinary	offerings	meet	with	your	approval,	Mister Imbrahim,”	said	Jhordel.	She	sipped	daintily	at	her	wine	and	eyed	him	shrewdly over	the	rim	of	the	glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	looked	up	at	her	and	smiled	apologetically,	abruptly	conscious	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>the	fact	that	he	had	been	attacking	his	meal	with	manners	not	much	better	than those	of	a	lower	deck	hand.	“You’ll	have	to	forgive	me,	Captain,”	he	said.	“It’s been	more	than	a	day	since	I	last	ate.	I	hadn’t	realized	how	hungry	I	was.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,”	she	breathed,	a	wry	look	in	her	eyes.	“It	would	appear	then,	that	we weren’t	the	only	ones	caught	off	guard	by	Admiralty.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed	not,	thought	Imbrahim.	He’d	been	called	in	and	given	little	more	than	a few	hours	to	prepare	himself.	A	few	hours	in	which	to	familiarize	himself	with the	matter	at	hand,	but	not	enough	time	to	do	it	justice.	I’m	flying	blind,	he	told himself;	and	so,	he	observed	somewhat	fearfully,	was	Jhordel.	That	was	not	a particularly	pleasant	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	has	occurred	to	me,	Commander,”	she	said	casually,	“that	when	you briefed	us	earlier	you	failed	to	mention	one	alternative	means	of	achieving	our objective.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	frowned	and	regarded	her	quizzically.	“I’m	sure	I	don’t	know	what	you mean,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	surveyed	her	table	with	a	lazy	eye,	taking	in	the	faces	of	the	other command	officers	seated	about	it.	Finally	her	gaze	drifted	back	to	Imbrahim;	but there	was	a	harder	edge	to	it	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	spent	a	few	hours	reviewing	the	charts,”	she	said	at	length.	“We	have some	fairly	decent	information	on	most	of	the	transit	points	located	throughout the	Empire,	both	in	the	Unity	and	in	the	Federation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	swallowed,	beginning	to	sense	where	she	was	headed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	grinned	at	him,	a	feral	grin,	and	he	saw	in	that	instant	a	flash	of	the	cold and	calculating	ruthlessness	that	had	made	her	so	feared	by	the	Unity	and	so vaunted	by	Carter	and	Jackson.	“I	believe	there	may	be	a	transit	point	that	can bring	us	to	within	a	couple	of	days	sublight	travel	from	the	last	suspected positions	of	the	Niagara	and	the	probes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	slowly	set	down	his	fork	and	picked	up	the	napkin	in	his	lap.	He dabbed	at	his	lips,	suddenly	no	longer	hungry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sure	Admiralty	considered	all	possibilities,”	he	said,	finally	finding	his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps,”	said	Jhordel;	but	he	could	tell	it	didn’t	matter	to	her	whether	they had	or	hadn’t.	She	would	do	things	her	way,	as	she	had	done	so	most	of	her	life since	Obidian. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Using	a	transit	point	in	Unity	space	would	be	courting	an	unnecessary	risk	on a	mission	that	may	well	be	fraught	with	far	greater	peril	than	any	of	us	are welling	to	concede,”	he	argued.	He	looked	quickly	around	the	table	and	saw	the others	were	gaping	at	him.	Gaping	at	them.	Him	and	Jhordel.	And	he	realized, then,	that	they	were	as	astonished	as	he	about	this	bombshell	the	captain	had dropped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	risk	involved	is	relatively	minor,”	Jhordel	insisted.	“We	can	make	the jump	directly	to	the	Unity	point,	then	use	it	to	jump	to	our	objective.	Our	time	in Unity	space	would	be	limited.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	make	it	sound	like	a	leisurely	stroll	through	the	countryside,”	he accused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With	all	due	respect,	Captain,	aren’t	all	Unity	points	guarded?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Afraid	of	a	little	action,	Commander?”	she	chided. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Afraid	we	might	jeopardize	our	mission,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	worry	too	much,	Mister	Imbrahim.”	Jhordel	addressed	her	officers	with a	knowing	look.	“Have	a	little	faith.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	for	the	Reds,	I’m	afraid,”	he	muttered	sourly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	blinked,	caught	off	guard	by	this	retort;	and	then	she	suddenly	guffawed, throwing	her	head	back	and	laughing	loudly.	Others	around	the	table	joined	in, until	even	Imbrahim	found	himself	smiling	at	the	joke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	make	a	spacers	out	of	you	yet,	Mister	Imbrahim.”	She	gave	him	a	sly look	as	she	raised	her	glass	in	a	toast.	“Success,”	she	declared,	glancing	around the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>“Success!”	they	all	chanted	as	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	as	Imbrahim	sipped	his	wine	and	studied	them,	he	wondered	if	they	truly understood	the	potential	danger	into	which	they	would	all	soon	be	plunged.	And then	he	almost	laughed,	because	of	course	they	did.	They	had	seen	the	face	of death	many	times,	in	many	guises.	They	had	stared	into	its	eyes	and	lived	to	tell the	tale.	Every	moment	they	were	out	there	fighting	the	Unity	they	lived	with	the knowledge	that	each	breath	they	breathed	might	very	well	be	their	last. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shuddered,	struck	by	the	absurdity	of	this	scene.	Here	they	were,	wining and	dining,	resplendent	in	their	finery,	acting	as	though	all	were	perfect	in	the universe.	But	it	wasn’t.	They	were	at	war.	Had	been	for	more	than	two	decades. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	lived	in	a	world	of	uncertainty,	never	knowing	when	they	went	out	into	the deeps	of	space	if	they	would	ever	return.	It	was	a	sobering	existence.	And	a brutally	lonely	one.	Under	such	circumstances	it	seemed	fruitless	to	strike	up meaningful	relationships	anywhere;	it	was	too	likely	you	might	one	day	awaken to	find	the	one	you	loved	no	longer	counted	among	the	living. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wondered	if	that	was	how	they	saw	things.	Was	it	all	so	clear	to	them?	Did they	understand	the	purpose	of	their	lives	so	well?	Or	were	they	like	he,	sitting here,	bewildered	by	events	that	unfolded	around	them? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	didn’t	feel	in	control	of	his	life;	indeed,	the	fact	he	was	here	confirmed	as much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	swallowed	the	last	of	his	wine	and	looked	towards	the	captain.	He saw	in	her	things	that	he	couldn’t	find	in	himself.	She	saw	this	war	as	a	soldier needed	to	see	it:	there	was	the	enemy	and	they	must	be	destroyed.	It	was	as simple	as	that.	No	complications.	No	unwieldy	conscience	to	leave	her wondering	and	indecisive,	dwelling	upon	the	right	and	the	wrong	of	an	act.	For her	the	lines	of	conflict	had	long	ago	been	drawn,	but	for	him	they	had	blurred with	time.	Nothing	seemed	quite	so	well	defined	as	it	once	had	been;	he	didn’t see	black	and	white,	but	only	gray. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps	it	was	because	he’d	fought	a	different	war	from	the	one	in	which she’d	engaged.	He’d	never	been	in	command	of	a	ship	and	had	never	ordered	the unleashing	of	destructive	forces	so	potent	that	in	seconds	they	could	kill millions.	How	many	ships	had	she	ordered	so	destroyed?	How	many	worlds? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel’s	eyes	met	his.	He	felt	himself	chilled	by	the	frostiness	of	that	look, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>and	quickly	glanced	away,	beyond	her,	to	the	viewports	that	opened	out	upon	the glorious	vista	of	Earth.	It	looked	so	beautiful	and	serene.	How	many	down	there would	care	if	this	ship	and	its	crew	simply	ceased	to	exist?	Not	many,	he suspected;	because	in	the	long	run	it	would	make	little	difference	to	their	lives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sun	would	still	shine	and	the	Earth	would	still	turn	on	its	axis.	Life	would	go on.	As	it	always	had.	As	it	always	must. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or	so	he	believed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or	so	he	thought	he	must. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a><b class="calibre3">7. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As	a	professional	courtesy,	Jhordel	invited	him	onto	the	bridge	during	the initial	phase-shift.	His	first	inclination	was	to	decline;	he	preferred	to	suffer	the indignities	of	the	shift	in	the	privacy	of	his	cabin.	The	captain’s	request, however,	was	clearly	as	good	as	an	order.	And	so	two	days	after	he	had	boarded the	Confederation	he	found	himself	sitting	on	the	bridge,	preparing	himself	for the	moment	when	the	Pearson	FTL	would	carry	them	over	the	light	barrier	and through	the	transit	point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	could	not	enter	the	complex	network	of	the	Matrix	without	first	phase-shifting.	To	a	sublight	ship	the	transit	points	that	were	the	gateways	to	this network	were	merely	anomalous	energy	spikes	in	the	background	radiation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	phase-shifting	the	transit	points	were	transparent.	Indeed,	to	the	human eye	they	were	invisible.	Nothing	marked	their	existence;	they	had	no	apparent source. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	had	often	wondered	how	they	had	first	been	discovered,	and suspected	it	had	been	quite	by	chance.	It	was	not	the	sort	of	thing	scientists	could have	guessed	at,	he	imagined,	since	there	had	never	been	any	reason	to	believe that	such	a	thing	as	the	Matrix	existed.	History	was	full	of	such	serendipitous discoveries.	Of	course,	not	all	of	them	had	been	so	beneficial;	and	he	couldn’t shake	the	feeling	that	whatever	the	Niagara	and	the	probes	had	encountered	was to	be	counted	among	the	latter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	they	could	make	the	jump	they	had	to	get	clear	of	Earth	and	its	moon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	you	phase-shifted	too	close	to	any	substantial	mass	you	could	end	up	almost anywhere—if	you	ended	up	any	place	at	all.	He	was	reminded	of	the	Phoenix and	quickly	put	the	thought	out	of	his	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	with	gravity	dispensators	cocooning	them	from	the	worst	of	the	g-forces brought	on	by	accelerating,	the	effect	on	the	human	body	was	punishing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	could	only	be	thankful	they	weren’t	doing	‘military’	maneuvers.	The dispensators	were	severely	tested	in	such	situations,	and	it	required	constant	use of	the	‘pumps’	to	keep	the	crew	alive.	A	price	one	paid,	he	supposed,	for seemingly	defying	the	laws	of	physics	and	thumbing	one’s	nose	at	the	universe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	glad	that	despite	the	Confederation’s	sophisticated	AI	unit,	the	bridge</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>crew	were	kept	busy	during	the	moments	prior	to	the	shift.	It	meant	no	eyes would	be	on	him	as	the	ship	made	the	jump;	and	consequently,	they	wouldn’t	see how	much	he	loathed	this	part	of	any	interstellar	journey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	force	of	acceleration	was	crushing,	but	not	sufficient	to	render	him unconscious.	Without	the	dispensators,	however,	he	would	have	been	flattened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Squashed	like	a	bug	under	a	shoe,	was	the	analogy	he	recalled	from	his Academy	days.	He	had	heard	of	instances	where	dispensators	had	failed	just	at the	point	of	peak	acceleration.	Needless	to	say,	nothing	much	had	survived	of ship	and	crew	in	such	cases. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	spacers	lived	with	that	reality	and	seemed	unbothered	by	it.	He	couldn’t say	the	same	of	himself;	it	made	him	blanch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	long	ago	learned	that	no	two	shifts	were	ever	exactly	alike,	each having	something	different	to	distinguish	it	from	the	other.	Not	that	they	were events	filled	with	spectacle	in	the	first	place.	There	were	no	fireworks,	nor monumental	revelations.	For	a	spacers,	Imbrahim	guessed	they	were	all	rather routine.	Routine,	but	never	taken	for	granted.	That	was	a	lesson	they	pounded into	your	head	over	and	over	in	the	Academy:	space	was	never	to	be	taken	for granted;	it	could	be	merciless	to	those	who	were	complacent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	into	hyperspace	and	through	the	point,	there	was	no	longer	a	need	for the	protective	embrace	of	the	bladders.	He	heaved	a	sigh	of	relief	as	they retracted	into	his	chair,	thankful	to	be	free	of	them	and	their	suffocating	grasp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	hyperspace,	acceleration	was	no	longer	experienced	by	those	within	the shell	of	the	ship.	Regardless	of	how	much	greater	it	became,	the	crew	of	the Confederation	would	feel	no	change. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oddly	enough,	he	felt	his	safest	in	hyperspace.	It	was	extraordinarily	difficult for	an	enemy	to	launch	any	sort	of	assault	against	you	while	the	ship	traveled	at hyperlight	speeds.	Of	course,	there	were	the	rare	occasions	when	a	ship	had made	a	jump	and	pulled	in	with	it	a	salvo	of	antimatter	torpedoes	that	had	been dispatched	to	destroy	it.	The	results	of	such	an	occurrence	were	unpredictable, though	it	was	suspected	that	more	than	one	ship	had	been	destroyed	in	such	a fashion.	And	then	there	were	the	strange	instances	of	debris	sometimes	as	large as	small	planetoids—being	sucked	into	a	transit	point.	No	one	could	explain	how that	happened,	but	the	consequences	could	be	devastating.	Such	a	mass	was	as</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>immovable	in	hyperspace	as	it	was	in	the	sublight	environment.	A	ship	in	transit encountering	such	a	body	on	the	same	plane	would	be	as	pulverized	as	any	that might	collide	with	a	similar	mass	outside	the	Matrix. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	much	action	now,”	said	Jhordel,	rising	easily	from	her	seat	and	looking as	though	she	had	not	just	come	through	the	punishing	ordeal	of	the	shift.	She smiled	down	at	him,	and	added,	“Until	we	reach	the	line,	of	course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	then?”	he	asked,	trying	to	match	her	steady	gaze	and	failing.	He	wished he	could	stand	and	not	feel	the	nausea	that	always	overcame	him	shortly	after	a shift.	But	he	knew	that	if	he	got	to	his	feet	just	now	he	would	embarrass	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	the	last	thing	he	wanted	to	do	in	front	of	Jhordel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	McLuhan	is	scheduled	to	link	up	with	us,”	she	said	absently,	looking forward,	towards	the	viewport.	“They’re	returning	from	near	the	sector	of	Unity we’re	interested	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	McLuhan!”	he	sputtered,	almost	choking	on	the	words.	“They	were	out at	the	T’Ching	Transit	Point.”	He	stared	at	her,	incredulous,	hoping	she	was	just pulling	his	leg	but	horribly	certain	she	wasn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	made	a	face.	“They	call	it	God’s	Eye	Point,”	she	grunted.	They	being	the Reds,	of	course. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	ignored	her	and	said,	“T’Ching.	You	can’t	be	serious.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	always	serious	when	it	comes	to	a	mission,”	she	said	stonily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shook	his	head,	aghast,	more	perturbed	now	than	he	had	been	the	night before	when	she	had	first	proposed	this	plan.	He	looked	up	at	her,	trying	to	quell the	odd	mix	of	rage	and	fear	that	had	seized	him.	“For	pity’s	sake,	Captain! </p>
<p class="calibre1">T’Ching	is	Chastity’s	transit	point.	Chastity!	And	we	could	only	exit	from	it.	To make	the	jump	that	would	get	us	near	to	the	Niagara’s	last	posted	position	we’d have	to	cross	the	system	to	T’Chau.”	Forgetting	his	earlier	prudence,	he	pushed himself	from	his	chair	and	stood	before	her	in	angry	disapprobation.	“It’ll	be swarming	with	Reds.	They	have	their	main	base	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	seemed	to	enjoy	his	discomfort.	“We	can	be	sure	they	won’t	be	expecting us	then,”	she	said,	the	tone	of	her	words	clearly	meant	to	goad. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>“They’re	the	most	frequented	transit	points	in	all	Unity	space!”	he	cried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Their	warships	are	constantly	coming	and	going.	And	with	Chastity	the	seat	of the	Church,	those	points	will	be	more	heavily	guarded	than	any	outside	of Earth’s.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which	is	why	there’ll	be	weaknesses	there	that	won’t	be	found	at	other, lesser	used	points,”	she	argued.	“With	so	much	traffic	coming	and	going	through T’Ching	and	T’Chau,	they	can’t	be	as	scrupulous	in	their	examination	of	each vessel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	gawked	at	her,	eyes	wide	with	incredulity.	“You	can’t	seriously	be proposing	we	jump	to	Chastity,”	he	said;	but	he	knew	she	was	very	serious, knew	it	was	all	part	of	that	dark	mystery	of	her	past.	He	could	see	in	her	eyes that	this	was	a	challenge	she	couldn’t	pass	on.	Wouldn’t	pass	on.	It	was	a	way	of thumbing	her	nose	at	the	Reds,	like	a	child	taunting	a	bully.	They	had	put	a	price on	her	head,	and	now	she	wanted	to	have	a	great	laugh	at	their	expense.	That	it might	jeopardize	them	all	seemed	irrelevant.	It	was	then	that	Imbrahim	decided Jhordel	was	quite	mad. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a><b class="calibre3">8. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	been	on	the	ships	since	long	before	the	war	officially	started,”	N’robo said.	He	smiled,	looking	almost	wistful.	“Back	in	those	days,	Commander,	we did	pretty	much	what	we	do	today.	But	we	didn’t	call	it	a	war.”	He	chuckled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	it	was	a	‘skirmish’	or	an	‘incident.’	On	the	ships,	though,	we	never	really fooled	ourselves:	we	knew	what	we	were	doing.	It	just	took	the	politicians	a little	longer	to	catch	up.	By	then,	of	course,	a	lot	of	good	people	had	died.”	He shrugged	and	sighed.	“Maybe	if	we’d	started	the	war	sooner	we	wouldn’t	still	be fighting	it	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	turned	away	from	the	viewport	of	the	doctor’s	office	and	looked across	the	room	at	the	chief	medical	officer.	“I	think	Jhordel’s	fighting	her	own war,”	he	said	quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aren’t	we	all,	Commander?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	the	kind	she	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	think	her	mad,	don’t	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	madness	to	take	this	ship	as	deep	into	Unity	space	as	she’s	proposing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	it?”	N’robo’s	thick,	gray	eyebrows	shot	up	on	his	forehead,	as	though	he were	startled	by	this	claim,	but	Imbrahim	thought	it	more	show	than	genuine surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	frowned	at	the	doctor.	“Surely	you	can	see	the	danger	of	it,”	he	pleaded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“These	days	there	are	few	missions	without	danger,”	the	doctor	observed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	always	gone	out	into	them	with	the	belief	I	might	not	make	it	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	this	is	unnecessary.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">N’robo	lifted	his	hands	in	a	gesture	of	helplessness.	“I’ve	been	with	many captains	in	my	time,	Commander.	Each	had	his	or	her	eccentricities.	But	none	of them	were	where	they	were	because	they	hadn’t	earned	that	place.	Admiralty doesn’t	hand	ships	to	people	it	can’t	trust.	The	men	and	women	who	occupy	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>center	seats	of	ships	like	the	Confederation	aren’t	ordinary,	Commander.	They’re something	extraordinary.	Something	special.	Something	rare.	So	it	may	well seem	they’re	a	little	mad,	but	perhaps	it’s	only	their	particular	brand	of	madness that	can	effectively	be	used	to	combat	the	insanity	of	war.	Perhaps	only	people like	Jhordel	have	a	clear	enough	vision	of	what	must	be	done	to	take	us	through to	victory	in	this	conflict.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	if	they	take	us	to	our	deaths?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	won’t	be	without	good	reason,	I’m	sure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	drew	a	breath	and	released	it	slowly	through	flared	nostrils.	At length	he	said,	“Jhordel’s	parents	were	both	killed	by	the	Unity.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On	the	attack	on	Tartarus,”	said	N’robo,	nodding.	“It’s	common	enough knowledge.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	her	desire	to	avenge	them	is	clouding	her	judgment,”	Imbrahim suggested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	barking	up	the	wrong	tree,	there,	Commander.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	shot	him	a	challenging	look.	“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	she’s	not	that	sort	of	person.	She	wouldn’t	endanger	other	lives because	of	some	personal	vendetta.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Her	history	suggests	otherwise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">N’robo	rolled	his	eyes.	“Look,	her	parents	were	killed	twenty	years	ago.	Don’t you	think	that	if	she	was	mentally	unstable	because	of	the	loss	of	her	parents,	as you	seem	to	be	suggesting,	she	would	have	been	found	out	by	now?	You	know Fleet	as	well	as	I.	You	know	they’re	constantly	assessing	the	psychological profile	of	each	and	every	one	of	us.	If	you	don’t	fit	into	a	set	of	given parameters,	they	quietly	let	you	go.	I’ve	seen	enough	spacers	discharged	in	my day,	and	the	navy	hasn’t	become	any	more	lenient	in	that	direction.	They	can’t afford	to.	When	ships	like	the	Confederation	cost	as	much	as	they	do	and	are	as important	to	the	Federation	as	they	are,	Fleet	certainly	can’t	run	the	risk	of handing	them	over	to	any	but	the	most	trusted	officers.	So	while	I’ve	no	doubt that	at	times	the	‘desire	to	avenge’	her	parents	has	been	a	driving	force	behind</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>some	of	Captain	Jhordel’s	actions,	I	refuse	to	subscribe	to	the	notion	that	she would	needlessly	jeopardize	ship	and	crew	simply	for	the	sake	of	vengeance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	ship	and	its	crew	are	foremost	in	her	mind	at	all	times.	And	I	should	know, being	the	ship’s	doctor.”	N’robo	leaned	back	in	his	chair	and	took	on	an	air	of smug	certitude. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	Mister	Imbrahim,”	he	concluded,	“the	deaths	of	her	parents	certainly	had something	to	do	with	the	molding	of	her	character,	but	Lhara	Jhordel	is	a	far more	complex	woman	than	that.	After	serving	with	her	for	more	than	three years,	I	can	personally	vouch	for	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	you	were	with	her	when	she	took	out	Trinity?”	Imbrahim	stared	at	him with	a	mixture	of	awe	and	incredulity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,”	N’robo	said.	He	smiled	crookedly.	“We	all	thought	her	crazy	then,”	he confessed.	“But	the	results	speak	for	themselves.	She	gave	the	Federation	a much	needed	victory.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At	the	cost	of	her	ship	and	considerable	risk	to	her	crew,	doctor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Grandy	was	nearing	retirement,”	N’robo	pointed	out.	“Better	that	it	end its	days	in	glory	than	as	so	much	worthless	scrap	floating	in	orbit	about	one	of the	lesser	worlds.	As	for	any	danger	Captain	Jhordel	may	have	placed	the	crew in,	well,	you	just	ask	the	people	who	served	with	her	on	that	ship.	I	venture	that not	one	would	speak	against	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	absolves	her	of	nothing,	doctor.	She	took	an	aging,	ill-equipped	ship into	a	region	of	space	she	never	should	have.	There	was	no	guarantee	when	you came	out	of	that	transit	point	that	you	wouldn’t	have	been	annihilated	by	Unity forces.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quite	true,	Commander.	But	there	are	few	situations	in	life	in	which	there	are guarantees.	Captain	Jhordel	took	a	risk,	I	grant	you	that.	But	how	much	more	of a	risk	than	that	taken	by	the	commanders	of	other	ships	in	this	war?	She	saw	an opportunity	and	exploited	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	were	part	of	a	fleet	that	had	just	been	attacked	by	Unity	raiders,”	said Imbrahim.	“There	was	a	lot	of	damage	among	the	Federation	ships.	Jhordel should	have	stayed	around	to	assist.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>“And	missed	the	one	chance	she	had	of	returning	enemy	fire.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	couldn’t	return	anything!	She	didn’t	have	the	weapons	to	go	up	against the	likes	of	the	three	frigates	that	attacked	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	had	one	chance	of	following	them,	Commander,”	N’robo	said	patiently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	as	well	as	I	that	it’s	virtually	impossible	to	follow	a	ship	into hyperspace.	The	moment	they	make	the	jump,	they’re	lost	to	you,	unless	you’re incredibly	lucky	and	guess	which	line	in	the	Matrix	they’ve	chosen.	But	Lhara did	the	impossible,	Commander.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	the	story,	doctor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you?”	N’robo	gave	him	a	dubious	look.	“It’s	not	all	in	the	reports, Commander.	Haven’t	you	wondered	how	she	managed	what	no	one	else	ever had?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	course	he	had	wondered.	He	had	spent	hours	pondering	that	very	point after	reading	her	personnel	records	and	the	official	report	on	the	matter.	But there	was	nothing	in	Admiralty’s	own	account	of	the	incident	to	suggest	how	she had	accomplished	what	many	deemed	a	miracle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	sat	down	in	the	chair	opposite	N’robo	and	looked	attentive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	listening,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	quite	simple,	really.”	N’robo	leaned	back	and	made	himself	comfortable, looking	for	all	the	world	like	some	old	vet	spinning	tall	tales.	Except	that Imbrahim	doubted	the	man	was	the	sort	to	lie.	Not	about	this.	Not	about someone	he	clearly	admired	a	great	deal.	“When	the	raiders	struck	we	were	on the	far	side	of	the	fleet.	They	came	in	fast,	from	out	of	a	cloud	of	planetesimals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	a	carefully	planned	maneuver,	because	the	assault	was	right	in	the	line	of the	transit	point.	They	merely	swept	past,	striking	as	they	gathered	speed	for	the jump.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	common	pattern	among	the	Unity,”	Imbrahim	acknowledged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye.	One	that	Captain	Jhordel	recognized	immediately.	She	knew	they	were going	to	jump,	and	knew	also	that	we	had	little	chance	of	making	the	jump	with them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>“So	how—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">N’robo	held	up	a	hand,	signaling	for	patience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sure,”	he	continued,	“you’ve	heard	of	those	occasions	when	torpedoes launched	at	a	ship	in	the	process	of	making	a	phase-shift	have	been	drawn	into hyperspace	along	with	the	ship.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	inclined	his	head	slightly,	said	nothing,	waiting	for	the	doctor	to	go on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	the	results	can	be	devastating.	I’m	not	fluent	on	the	technicalities	of	it all,	but	as	I	understand	it,	the	field	generated	by	the	Pearson	FTL	of	a	ship becomes	elongated	in	some	manner	as	it	approaches	the	transit	point.	Anything entering	the	envelope	of	this	field	at	the	moment	of	jump	is	dragged	into hyperspace,	and	not	only	finds	itself	in	hyperspace,	but	somehow	drawn	along the	same	line	of	the	Matrix	as	the	generating	force	of	the	field.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	felt	a	wrench	in	his	gut.	It	didn’t	take	much	to	guess	what	Jhordel had	done	with	the	Grand	Banks.	How	she	had	had	the	guts	to	try	such	a maneuver	he	couldn’t	fathom,	however.	And	for	all	N’robo	protestations	to	the contrary,	it	seemed	to	him	that	it	was	just	more	evidence	of	how	utterly	insane she	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Since	we	couldn’t	spin	up	our	Pearson	quickly	enough	to	jump	with	the Unity	ships,	Captain	Jhordel	simply	gambled.”	N’robo	grinned	broadly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	inserted	the	Grand	Banks	into	the	elongated	conversion	field,”	Imbrahim finished	for	him,	his	voice	thin.	“It	would	have	been	enormous	and	considerably more	powerful	than	usual	with	the	three	ships	making	the	jump	together.”	Which in	itself,	he	noted	silently,	was	terribly	risky.	In	the	Academy	they	had	always proscribed	such	a	procedure,	since	phase-shifting	in	the	presence	of	a	mass	of considerable	size	was	reckoned	to	be	potentially	fatal.	And	ships	that	close	to one	another	might	constant	enough	mass	to	make	the	jump	a	risk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	quite	an	experience,”	N’robo	remarked.	“Not	like	any	phase-shift	I’d ever	experienced.	Not	like	any	I’ve	had	since.	But	it	worked.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	at	the	other	end—”	Imbrahim	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>“We	didn’t	stay	with	them	in	hyperspace.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stared	back	at	the	doctor,	stunned.	“How	on	earth…”	He	faltered,	blinked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	spun	up	the	FTL	in	hyperspace,”	N’robo	related	gleefully,	delighting	at his	companion’s	reaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can’t	be	serious.	No	one—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	one	ever	had	to	before.	But	she	did,	Commander.	She	had	the	balls	to try.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Balls,	doctor?	Are	you	sure	that’s	what	it	was?	She	couldn’t	have	had	any idea	it	would	work.	It	could	have	killed	you	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">N’robo	dismissed	this	with	an	airy	wave	of	a	hand.	“If	we’d	been	destroyed the	raiders	would	have	been	as	well.	Three	for	one	wouldn’t	have	been	so	bad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	just	linked	at	him	blankly	and	wondered	how	Jhordel	could command	such	obvious	devotion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyway,	where	was	I?”	The	doctor	looked	thoughtful,	scratched	at	his	chin, then	brightened.	“Oh,	yes,”	he	declaimed;	“we	were	in	hyper,	the	drive	was	spun up,	and	the	skipper	let	the	Unity	ships	run.	They	continued	to	accelerate	through hyperspace	while	we	maintained	a	constant	velocity.	It	meant	coming	out	of	shift at	the	other	end	some	two	days	later.	Time	enough	to	prepare	what	would eventually	become	Fleet	history.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	soon	after	you	dropped	shift	did	you	loose	the	life	pods?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	‘after,’	Commander.	Before.	The	pods	were	released	just	before	we dropped	to	sublight.	Only	the	captain	remained	on	board.	The	pods	were	dragged into	sublight	space	just	as	we	had	been	dragged	into	hyperspace.	But	once	the Pearson	was	cut	and	the	ship’s	sublights	fired	up,	we	were	all	left	far	behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	bailed	out	just	after	the	sublights	kicked	in,	which	is	why	she	was	much closer	to	the	station	when	the	Grandy	struck.	A	little	bit	closer	and	she	would have	been	sucked	in	along	with	everything	else	when	the	graviton	collection coils	collapsed	into	a	singularity.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	a	fascinating	tale.	Also	a	very	chilling	one,	for	it	gave	Imbrahim	an</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>even	clearer	impression	of	the	sort	of	commanding	officer	Jhordel	was.	Her Academy	instructors	had	described	her	as	a	model	student,	prone	to	being	a	little on	the	cautious	side.	But	after	Obsidian	things	had	changed.	She	had	changed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	thought	that	an	understatement.	And	yet,	she	had	won	favor	among	much	of the	Admiralty.	Perhaps	because	her	methods	garnered	results,	and	in	a	war	like this	maybe	that	was	all	that	mattered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	who	was	he	to	argue?	He	didn’t	know	what	it	was	like	to	be	in	command of	a	warship.	He	never	would.	And	it	must	mean	something	when	you	gained such	a	reputation	that	you	were	feared	and	reviled	by	the	enemy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	Commander,	what	do	you	think	of	our	Captain	Jhordel	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wanted	to	laugh,	because	the	question	seemed	absurd.	But	instead,	he	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	taking	us	to	Chastity,	doctor!”	That	seemed	to	speak	for	itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Taking	us	to	Chastity	because	she	believes	it’s	the	best	way	to	go,”	N’robo said	confidently.	“I	don’t	question	the	captain’s	judgment	in	these	matters.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	you	should,”	Imbrahim	warned,	punctuating	his	statement	with	an angry	snort.	“We	have	more	chance	of	surviving	a	drop	into	the	chromosphere	of a	star.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">N’robo	smiled	indulgently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	said	something	to	amuse	you,	doctor?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	I	shouldn’t	tell	you;	it	may	convince	you	more	than	ever	that	our good	captain	is	mad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	scowled	at	him.	“I	think	the	damage	is	done.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	then…”	N’robo	drew	a	breath,	then	went	on.	“This	ship,”	he	said, gesturing	expansively,	“has	been	through	the	chromosphere	of	a	star.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	rolled	his	eyes.	“Why	doesn’t	that	surprise	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	because	Captain	Jhordel	is	neither	as	unpredictable	nor	as	insane	as you	would	have	yourself	believe,	Commander.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a><b class="calibre3">9. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Lieutenant-Commander	Takiro	looked	ill-at-ease	in	the	comfort	of	the Confederation’s	briefing	room.	Imbrahim	wondered	if	the	sheer	size	of	a	ship like	the	frigate	was	intimidating	to	a	man	who	spent	weeks	at	a	time	in	the claustrophobic	confines	of	a	vessel	like	the	McLuhan.	Indeed,	as	he	looked around	the	table	at	the	faces	of	the	Confederation’s	command	officers	he	was struck	by	the	realization	that	these	dozen	men	and	women	numbered	nearly	half of	Takiro’s	crew.	A	spook,	of	which	the	McLuhan	was	one,	seldom	carried	more than	thirty.	There	wasn’t	need	for	much	more	than	that,	given	that	the	primary objective	of	such	ships	was	information	gathering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Confederation	had	dropped	shift	several	hours	ago,	and	was	now	moving at	sublight	speeds	parallel	to	the	Pomerium	Line.	The	McLuhan	rode	off	its starboard	quarter,	matching	speed,	and	visible	from	where	Imbrahim	sat	if	he turned	his	head	and	looked	out	the	briefing	room	viewports.	Visible,	but	barely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	no	ports	from	which	light	could	spill	out	into	the	deep	night	of	space, nor	navigation	beacons	blinking	on	and	off	to	signal	its	presence.	The	hull	was jet	black,	looking	like	some	sort	of	articulated	sea	urchin	with	the	huge	bulb	of	a Pearson	FTL	and	a	cluster	of	a	half-dozen	sublight	engines	fastened	to	its	stern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sensor	and	scanning	antennae	bristled	from	it	in	all	directions,	rather	threatening in	appearance,	but	lethal	only	for	the	information	they	could	gather	for	use against	the	enemy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	shuddered,	remembering	all	too	well	the	many	times	he	had	spent	in similar	ships.	But	it	had	not	been	the	discomfort	that	had	bothered	him	so	much as	the	skulking	about	far	behind	enemy	lines,	sometimes	so	close	to	Unity worlds	that	he’d	been	certain	they’d	be	detected.	Ships	like	the	McLuhan, however,	carried	an	array	of	devices	that	permitted	them	to	move	almost	right into	orbit	about	enemy	planets	without	much	risk	of	detection.	Without	that,	his job	would	have	been	exceedingly	difficult.	Being	couriered	directly	to	an assignment	in	the	Unity	was	much	faster	and	safer	than	having	to	go	the	longer, more	conventional	route.	The	latter	involved	a	convoluted	process	and	meant depending	upon	commercial	liners	and	freighters	to	get	him	across	the Pomerium	Line	into	Unity	space.	It	also	meant	risking	detection	at	each checkpoint—of	which	there	were	many	in	the	regions	controlled	by	the	Red Catholics. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>“You	were	actually	in	orbit	about	Chastity?”	the	second	officer,	Erin	Chen, was	asking	as	Imbrahim	rejoined	the	conversation.	She	wore	a	look	of skepticism,	which	was	mirrored	in	the	faces	of	some	of	the	other,	younger officers.	But	not,	he	noted,	in	either	Jhordel’s	or	N’robo’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Takiro	smiled	crookedly.	“Only	long	enough	to	do	a	quick	survey,”	he	assured them	all,	looking	somewhat	apologetic	about	it.	“There	was	a	small	window	of opportunity	during	which	the	risk	of	detection	was	minimal.	A	solar	flare	on Messiah	gave	us	the	cover	we	needed	to	get	in	close	enough	to	do	some	scans.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wasn’t	your	equipment	also	affected	by	the	flare?”	N’robo	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Unfortunately,	yes,”	the	young	commander	admitted.	“However,	we	were able	to	do	visuals	in	various	parts	of	the	spectrum.	We	also	mapped	the	current locations	of	the	two	transit	points.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel’s	eyes	seemed	to	brighten	at	this.	“That’s	the	information	I’m	most interested	in,”	she	said,	leaning	forward	eagerly,	her	forearms	pressed	against	the table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	position	of	transit	points	was	not	constant,	although	the	variations	in	their locations	was	seldom	sufficient	to	cause	major	navigation	problems.	Indeed, they	were	considered	stable	enough	to	validate	the	construction	of	numerous waystations	throughout	the	Earth	Empire.	Often	the	stations	were	linked	with	the marker	buoys	that	tracked	through	space	with	the	point.	In	deep	space,	away from	systems,	this	was	not	of	great	concern.	But	within	systems	the	migration	of the	points	could	sometimes	cause	serious	problems.	There	were	even	those	who believed	that	the	radical	energy	bursts	that	occasionally	showed	up	in	the	points were	the	result	of	another	point	within	the	Matrix	migrating	through	the	core	of	a star. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	made	Imbrahim	more	than	a	little	queasy	to	reflect	on	the	implications	of such	a	thing;	it	was	possible	a	ship	could	unknowingly	shift	to	such	a	point	and come	out	in	the	heart	of	a	sun.	And	not	even	Jhordel,	he	thought,	with	little satisfaction,	could	escape	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	points	are	currently	across	system	from	one	another,”	Tagiro	was	telling Jhordel.	He	used	the	com-link	in	front	of	him	to	call	up	a	holo	of	the	Messiah system.	The	sun	glowed	a	bright	yellow-gold,	while	Chastity	was	indicated	by	a tiny	blue	sphere.	On	either	side	of	the	sun	two	winking	red	markers	revealed	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>locations	of	the	transit	points.	Even	to	Imbrahim,	who	was	no	expert	on	the matter,	it	was	clear	that	to	move	from	T’Ching	to	T’Chau	could	involve	passing close	to	Chastity	or	whipping	around	the	far	side	of	Messiah.	Those	were	the only	two	options	that	would	keep	their	time	in	the	system	to	a	minimum.	But	in neither	case	could	they	hope	to	avoid	detection.	Even	Tagiro’s	incomplete	data suggested	that	the	system	was	thick	with	Unity	ships.	Not	surprising,	since Chastity	was	the	center	of	the	Unity	universe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	is	one	good	thing,”	Tagiro	offered.	All	eyes	turned	to	him	eagerly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	a	fragmentary	asteroid	belt	currently	passing	near	T’Chau.	We	used	it ourselves	to	hide	in	while	waiting	for	a	chance	to	jump	through	the	point.	It would	afford	some	cover,	though	how	effective	it	would	be	for	a	ship	as	large	as the	Confederation,	I’ve	no	idea.	The	Reds	are	by	no	means	primitive	when	it comes	to	detection	equipment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	didn’t	spot	you,”	Wethers	remarked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	we’re	not	a	frigate,	Commander.	The	McLuhan	is	designed	specifically for	stealth.	By	its	very	nature	the	Confederation	is	difficult	to	conceal.	Even	with the	latest	in	shields	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">counter-measures	equipment,	you’re	still	a	large	mass.	At	a	standstill	or	drifting among	debris,	you’re	probably	quite	safe	from	detection—even	within	as densely	an	occupied	zone	as	the	Messiah	system.	But	the	moment	you	move,	the impediments	of	your	mass	become	apparent.	You’re	far	more	easily	detected than	a	spook.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	don’t	intend	to	hang	around	long	enough	to	be	detected,”	Jhordel observed	dryly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	if	we	are?”	asked	Imbrahim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	the	Reds	will	wish	they	hadn’t	heard	of	us,	Commander.”	The	captain smiled,	a	thin-lipped	smile,	the	malice	of	which	was	signified	in	the	cold,	hard glare	of	her	eyes.	Imbrahim	was	thankful	he	wasn’t	her	enemy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a><b class="calibre3">10. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">This	time	he	asked	to	be	on	the	bridge,	not	wanting	to	have	to	sit	in	his	cabin and	sweat	out	the	anxious	moments	ahead.	In	minutes	they	would	be	dropping shift,	coming	out	of	T’Ching	into	Unity	space,	into	the	Messiah	system,	the	heart of	Red	Catholic	territory.	It	was	difficult	enough	to	believe	the	McLuhan	had dared	to	go	where	no	Federation	ship	had	gone	in	decades,	but	it	had	at	least been	a	spook,	designed	to	slip	through	the	night	undetected.	A	ghost.	A	shadow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Confederation	would	be	hard	put	to	duplicate	that	feat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	sat	in	his	seat	and	watched	the	people	about	him,	Imbrahim	was	aware of	the	tension	that	engaged	the	bridge.	It	was	not	fear,	but	excitement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unbelievably,	these	men	and	women	seemed	eager	for	what	lay	ahead;	it	was	not a	sentiment	he	shared.	He’d	seen	the	Unity	as	they	never	had.	He	knew	what	the enemy	was	capable	of	doing,	knew	that	it	would	be	far	from	pleasant	to	be	a prisoner	of	war	in	the	hands	of	the	Reds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	maybe	she	knows,	he	thought,	watching	Jhordel	closely.	Maybe	that’s	her secret.	Maybe	that’s	the	mystery	of	Obsidian	Carter’s	keeping	guarded	for	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	would	her	crew	think	if	they	knew	the	truth?	Knew	the	truth	about	her, and	about	the	Unity?	They’d	always	viewed	the	enemy	at	a	distance,	as machines	to	be	destroyed,	or	bases	to	be	razed.	They’d	spent	their	war	years	thus far	harassing	the	Reds	and	generally	making	life	miserable	for	the	Cardinali.	To them,	venturing	so	deep	into	the	heartland	of	the	Unity	was	yet	another	chance to	do	more	of	the	same.	They	didn’t	seem	to	consider	the	possibility	of	capture or	defeat—perhaps	because	it	didn’t	appear	to	be	in	the	lexicon	of	their	captain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed,	outwardly	Jhordel	seemed	to	be	treating	this	excursion	into	enemy territory	as	no	different	from	any	other	mission—a	fact	that	Imbrahim	found more	than	a	little	disconcerting.	He	had	the	impression	that	for	the Confederation’s	captain	this	was	all	something	of	a	game,	and	that	their	mission to	uncover	the	mystery	of	what	had	happened	to	the	Niagara	was	secondary	in her	mind	to	this	bold	dash	through	the	enemy’s	stronghold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look	sharp	people,”	Jhordel	said.	She	glanced	over	at	Imbrahim,	the inimitable	feral	grin	creasing	her	lips.	“It	won’t	be	long	now,	Commander.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	had	a	feeling	she	took	some	pleasure	in	seeing	the	sick	look	on	his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>face.	Not	that	that	was	unfamiliar	territory: Spacers	had	always	considered	themselves	a	breed	apart,	and	tended	to	look down	upon	groundlings	like	himself.	And	when	it	came	to	Naval	Intelligence,	no one	seemed	particularly	enamored	of	the	men	and	women	who	populated	that branch	of	the	service.	Largely,	he	suspected,	because	of	the	Empaths,	whom even	he	found	unsettling	to	be	about,	despite	being	a	latent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	began	issuing	orders,	and	the	bridge	quickly	became	a	hive	of	activity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	felt	himself	floundering	in	the	midst	of	it	all,	drowning	in	the cacophony	of	sound	that	filled	the	narrow	spaces.	The	faces	of	the	crew	were studies	in	concentration,	not	in	the	least	betraying	the	evidence	of	fear	he	was certain	marked	his	own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	been	fearless	on	many	solo	excursions	behind	enemy	lines.	But	in	all his	field	operations	he	had	had	some	measure	of	control.	Here	he	could	only	sit and	watch	as	events	unfolded,	listening	to	procedures	that	were	largely	a	mystery to	him,	uncertain	of	the	good	and	the	bad	of	it.	That	ignorance,	more	than anything	else,	contributed	to	his	disquietude,	and	left	him	white-knuckled	and squirming	in	his	seat	as	they	approached	the	exit	from	the	Matrix. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel’s	plan	was	quite	simple.	Imbrahim	thought	it	too	simple;	it	was	his experience	that	such	things	seldom	worked	as	they	were	supposed	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless,	there	was	a	degree	of	elegance	to	it:	They	would	come	out	of	the transit	point	behind	a	barrage	of	antimatter	torpedoes,	which	would	be intentionally	triggered	so	as	to	momentarily	blind	any	sensors	or	ships	in	the immediate	vicinity.	Theoretically	this	would	give	them	enough	time	to	get	well clear	of	the	point	and	the	arsenal	that	protected	it.	Theoretically,	because	there was	no	guarantee	the	radiation	released	by	the	torps	would	sufficiently	blind	the enemy	so	as	to	prevent	them	from	targeting	the	Confederation	and	making	short work	of	her.	As	it	was,	the	barrage	would	eliminate	any	element	of	surprise	and immediately	warn	the	Reds	of	the	presence	of	an	intruder.	That	would	make	it much	more	difficult	to	cross	the	system	to	T’Chau. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’ll	be	like	a	fox	on	a	hunt,	thought	Imbrahim	disagreeably. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	prayed	the	fates	would	be	kinder	to	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ship	dropped	shift,	an	eerie,	silent	plunge	into	darkness,	a	stone	falling endlessly	into	a	fathomless	abyss.	And	Imbrahim	found	himself	waiting	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>telltale	moment	of	impact,	when	the	illusory	comfort	and	safety	of	the	ship would	be	shattered,	like	the	silence	in	a	well	as	the	stone	cast	into	it	strikes	water and	waves	wash	noisily	against	rock.	He	closed	his	eyes	and	wished	himself elsewhere,	and	wondered,	not	for	the	first	time,	why	it	was	that	he	found	himself here.	Admiralty	had	chosen	him	for	the	task,	but	Admiralty	could	have	chosen so	many	others.	Of	course,	he	could	have	refused,	but	it	had	never	even	occurred to	him	to	consider	such	a	notion.	He	liked	to	think	it	was	because	of	loyalty,	but in	the	back	of	his	mind	he	recalled	his	earlier	conversation	with	Jhordel	and wondered	if	it	was	really	more	about	not	standing	up	to	Jackson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	end	it	didn’t	matter,	he	convinced	himself.	In	the	end,	for	good	or	bad, he	had	long	ago	committed	himself	to	Fleet.	Initially	because	of	the	idealism	of youth,	but	more	lately	because	there	seemed	no	alternative.	He	couldn’t	be	blind like	the	citizens	of	the	corporates	were.	As	far	as	he	was	concerned,	one supported	the	Federation	or	one	acquiesced	to	a	future	dominated	by	the	Red Catholic	tyranny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	so	here	I	am,	he	thought,	and	almost	laughed;	fate	had	never	been	too kind	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	not	a	great	deal	to	see	out	the	main	viewport	of	the	bridge.	There never	usually	was.	Even	with	its	electronic	enhancements	it	could	not	display	a fraction	of	the	information	the	vast	array	of	ship’s	sensors	provided.	Designers had	often	argued	that	such	features	were	superfluous,	as	were	all	the	viewports on	the	ship.	But	designers	were	not	spacers,	and	spacers	had	always	claimed	a need	to	see	the	world	about	them.	Even	if	it	was	just	blackness	and	the	stars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	something	in	the	human	psyche	that	demanded	that	window	out	onto space.	It	gave	one	a	sense	of	contact	and	placement.	A	sense	of	belonging.	You didn’t	feel	quite	so	isolated,	quite	so	claustrophobic.	It	was	a	connection	that even	Imbrahim	found	somewhat	soothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stared	at	the	viewport	ahead	of	him,	watching	the	chaos	of	color	that whirled	past	them,	the	sweat	of	anticipation	beginning	to	rise	on	his	flesh.	A	cold sweat	of	fear,	inspired	by	his	ignorance	and	fueled	by	his	imagination.	The scenarios	that	presented	themselves	to	him	were	endless,	and	he	didn’t	find himself	comforted	by	any	of	them.	He	looked	at	Jhordel	and	wasn’t	reassured. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	shifting	color	of	hyperspace	seemed	to	coalesce,	coming	together	as	a darkness.	He	watched,	somewhat	fascinated,	as	a	salvo	of	antimatter	torpedoes</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>shot	forth	from	the	bow,	tiny	pinpricks	of	light	arcing	outwards	as	their	engines flared	in	the	darkness.	Then	they	seemed	to	merge	as	one,	a	lone	star	that	grew rapidly	more	distant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	counted	the	seconds,	waiting	for	the	torpedoes	to	self-destruct.	It was	not	a	long	wait.	Only	moments	after	the	Confederation	had	exited hyperspace,	the	half-dozen	torpedoes	blossomed	into	miniature	suns,	the	wave	of a	radiation	that	spread	out	from	them	sweeping	across	the	frigate,	blinding	the sensors	and	triggering	alarms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	tensed,	expecting	a	response	from	the	enemy.	But	the	ship	continued	to	fall inward	to	the	sun,	towards	Chastity	and	the	stronghold	of	the	Unity	fleet.	It would	have	been	easy,	then,	to	have	assumed	they	were	safe,	that	they	had	made it	past	the	worst	obstacle.	But	they	hadn’t.	Chastity	was	ahead,	with	surely	a strong	enough	defense	to	give	even	Jhordel	pause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ll	be	looking	for	us	now,”	said	Jhordel,	sounding	almost	jolly	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	had	been	thinking	the	same	thing,	but	with	far	less	enthusiasm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	the	antimatter	blast	had	been	effective	in	getting	them	this	far,	it	had	also been	a	beacon	to	the	forces	arrayed	against	them.	It	wasn’t	too	difficult	to imagine	the	ships	in	orbit	about	Chastity	beginning	to	stir,	awakening	from	their slumber,	ranging	their	battery	of	defenses	against	the	incoming	intruder.	Some would	begin	the	long	climb	out	of	the	sun’s	well	of	gravity,	headed	towards	an interception	of	the	Confederation,	while	others	would	lay	in	wait	about	the planet	in	case	the	enemy	managed	to	circumvent	the	ships	sent	to	stop	it.	He knew	the	drill	well,	for	it	was	the	same	on	Earth,	and	on	a	dozen	or	so	other worlds	considered	critical	to	the	Federation.	It	was	a	plan	with	few	apparent weaknesses,	which	was	a	weakness	in	itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	Academy	they	had	learned	that	such	plans	were	predicated	on	the	belief that	the	enemy	would	behave	in	a	certain	manner.	Strangely	enough,	this	was	not altogether	wishful	thinking.	History	had	shown	time	and	again	that	there	was	an element	of	predictability	in	warfare.	Much	like	a	classic	game	of	chess,	the strategies	of	opponents	in	a	given	conflict	were	often	maneuvers	that	had	proved themselves	innumerable	times	in	the	past.	The	key	to	success	was	in	using	such moves	in	imaginative	combinations,	or	unpredictable	ways.	The	more experienced	and	daring	of	commanders	were	able	to	do	just	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>Imbrahim	looked	at	Jhordel,	realizing	she	was	one	of	these;	and	he	sat anxiously	wondering	how	she	proposed	to	get	them	past	the	Unity	defenses unscathed.	He	couldn’t	have	begun	to	imagine	what	she	had	in	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a><b class="calibre3">11. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	have	less	than	an	hour	before	they	reach	us,”	Jhordel	said	to	the	other officers	assembled	in	the	briefing	room.	She	seemed	unconcerned	by	the impending	confrontation,	a	fact	which,	nevertheless,	did	not	reassure	Imbrahim in	the	least.	There	was	something	in	her	manner	that	was	far	too	cavalier	for	his tastes;	in	these	circumstances	he	would	have	preferred	a	more	conservative approach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“According	to	our	long	range	scans	there	are	six	ships	headed	towards	us	from the	vicinity	of	Chastity,	and	another	three	coming	in	behind	us	from	the	transit point.”	She	looked	tellingly	at	Imbrahim,	but	he	didn’t	let	her	see	his	distress.	In his	mind,	however,	the	prospect	of	being	confronted	by	nine	enemy	warships was	more	than	just	a	little	daunting.	Again	he	deliberated	the	insanity	of	what they	were	doing,	but	he	could	fathom	it	now	no	better	than	before.	Clearly,	he realized,	he	didn’t	comprehend	the	mind	of	a	strategist	like	Jhordel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	would	appear	to	be	seriously	outnumbered,”	he	said,	his	gaze	fixed squarely	on	Jhordel,	denunciation	in	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	number	of	the	force	arrayed	against	us	is	of	little	concern,”	Jhordel	said, smiling	as	she	addressed	him,	her	regard	warmed	by	the	blood-eagerness	he sensed	in	her.	He	thought	her	like	a	predatory	beast,	an	animal	stalking	its	prey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	lion.	A	tiger.	Something	wild.	Something	untamed	and	dangerous.	Too volatile.	Too	capricious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nine	against	one	is	hardly	a	laughing	matter,”	Imbrahim	rebuked.	“We	can’t possibly	hope	to	fight	our	way	past	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Indeed,”	said	Jhordel,	nodding	agreement.	“I’ve	no	intention	of	engaging them,	Commander.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	started,	caught	off	guard	by	her	response.	“I	don’t	understand,”	he managed	to	mutter;	but	as	he	looked	around	the	table	at	the	others,	he	had	the impression	they	weren’t	so	ignorant	as	he	of	what	she	intended. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only	a	fool	would	be	drawn	into	such	a	lopsided	battle,”	she	continued.	“And despite	your	own	thoughts	to	the	contrary,	Commander,	I’m	no	fool.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>“With	all	due	respect,	Captain,	how	do	you	propose	to	avoid	the	patently unavoidable?”	Imbrahim	studied	her	intently,	bemused	by	her	disarming	calm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Even	were	we	to	change	course	now,	we	couldn’t	escape	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	but	we	can,	Commander.”	There	was	a	dark,	cruel	laughter	in	Jhordel’s eyes	and	in	her	voice.	“They	can’t	chase	what	isn’t	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	frowned.	“What	isn’t	there?”	he	echoed,	shaking	his	head.	“We have	none	of	the	stealth	capabilities	of	a	spook,”	he	pointed	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At	our	present	velocity	it	will	take	us	hours	to	cross	the	system	to	T’Chau,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said	Jhordel.	“Even	were	we	to	somehow	circumvent	the	threat	of	the	ships closing	in	upon	us,	we’d	still	be	faced	with	having	to	get	beyond	Chastity.	I think	we’re	all	agreed	that	would	be	a	formidable	task.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	suddenly	dawned	on	Imbrahim	that	she	was	proposing	the	very	thing	they’d come	all	this	way	to	avoid.	“You’re	going	to	skip	jump!”	His	eyes	widened	in horror. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can’t	be	serious!”	he	cried.	“The	only	reason	we’re	here	is	because	it was	considered	too	dangerous	to	make	the	jump	without	a	transit	point.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	nodded	soberly.	“Agreed,”	she	said.	“But	a	skip	jump	isn’t	the	same thing	at	all.	A	mere	few	seconds	in	hyper.	Not	long	enough	to	be	of	any	real threat	to	our	safety.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	in-system!”	He	gaped	at	her	in	disbelief.	“We’re	far	too	close	to	the	sun and	Chastity	to	make	it	safe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ships	have	jumped	from	closer,”	she	reminded	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With	some	disastrous	results,”	Imbrahim	countered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our	choices	are	limited,	Commander.	We	either	make	the	jump,	or	we engage	the	Unity.”	She	looked	slowly	around	the	table	at	her	command	officers, then	settled	her	gaze	squarely	on	him	again.	“I	have	little	trouble	in	choosing between	the	two.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>“You	knew	it	would	come	down	to	this,”	he	charged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	looked	genuinely	surprised.	“I	assumed	you	understood	what	crossing the	Messiah	system	would	entail.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	realized	it	would	be	foolish	to	protest	further.	They	were	here	now,	and there	could	be	no	turning	back.	They	had	no	choice	but	to	forge	ahead;	and Jhordel’s	option	was	really	the	only	viable	one	they	had.	How	else	to	evade	the Unity	in	their	own	space?	And	surely	making	a	skip	jump	across	the	system	was less	of	a	risk	than	facing	a	fleet	of	warships. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	gave	Jhordel	a	dour	look	and	said,	“I’m	reminded	of	an	old	Earth adage:	There	are	old	pilots	and	there	are	bold	pilots,	but	there	are	no	old	bold pilots.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	worry,	Commander,”	Jhordel	said,	chuckling	softly	as	she	spoke.	“I intend	to	live	to	a	ripe	old	age.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	pray	you	do,	Captain.”	He	paused,	then	added,	“For	all	our	sakes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a><b class="calibre3">12. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">They	couldn’t	jump	right	after	coming	out	of	transit.	The	Pearson	had	to	be recharged,	which	meant	a	half	hour	or	so	during	which	they	remained	exposed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	once	that	time	had	passed	Jhordel,	much	to	Imbrahim’s	horror,	seemed	on	no hurry	to	make	the	jump.	She	was,	is	seemed,	intent	upon	making	something	of	a game	of	it,	leaving	the	phase-shift	to	the	last	possible	moment.	He	could	only	sit and	watch	in	impotent	silence	as	the	enemy	appeared	to	draw	an	ever	tightening net	about	the	Confederation.	But	no	one	on	the	bridge	showed	concern,	even though	it	was	clear	there	was	enormous	risk	attached	to	what	they	were	about	to do.	They	took	Jhordel’s	orders	with	a	decided	calm,	responding	with	a mechanical	efficiency	as	the	captain	called	for	the	Pearson	to	be	spun	up	and ordered	both	fore	and	aft	torpedoes	readied	for	launching.	The	latter	request Imbrahim	thought	a	valid	precaution—though	making	a	jump	like	this	with active	munitions	was	proscribed	by	the	experts.	But	then,	the	experts	had probably	never	considered	the	possibility	of	someone	like	Jhordel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	worry,”	N’robo	had	told	him	after	the	briefing,	“the	captain	would never	put	her	ship	at	risk.	It	means	everything	to	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Imbrahim	wondered	about	that;	and	he	couldn’t	shirk	the	feeling	Jhordel had	manipulated	matters	to	get	her	ship	here.	Aside	from	spooks,	no	Federation ship	had	ever	been	so	deep	into	Unity	space.	And	although	she’d	been authorized	to	go	where	other	Federation	ships	couldn’t,	even	Admiralty	would never	have	dared	allow	her	to	venture	so	close	to	Chastity	at	this	point	in	the war.	Now	she’d	used	the	opportunities	handed	her	to	forge	her	own	excuse	for doing	so;	and	Imbrahim	was	presented	with	yet	another	piece	to	the	complex puzzle	of	this	woman.	It	was	clear	she	had	her	own	agenda,	and	he	was	positive it	all	went	back	to	Obsidian,	to	the	dark	mystery	of	her	past.	A	past	he	would never	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	light	of	what	he	did	know	of	her,	it	came	as	no	surprise	to	him	that	when they	made	the	jump	in	system,	it	wasn’t	to	a	position	within	safe	striking distance	of	T’Chau. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a><b class="calibre3">13. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	jump	was	unlike	any	phase-shift	Imbrahim	had	ever	experienced.	It	lasted less	than	the	space	of	one	short	breath;	indeed,	too	brief	to	gather	fears	and	dwell in	fevered	anticipation	of	the	outcome.	Not	that	there	was	not	time	enough	for that	beforehand.	Jhordel	waited	until	the	Unity	ships	had	launched	several salvoes	of	torpedoes	at	the	Confederation	before	calling	for	the	shift.	She	was playing	for	maximum	dramatic	effect,	and	perhaps	hoping	the	Unity,	in	their haste	to	dispatch	the	enemy,	would	end	up	taking	out	one	another	in	the confusion	that	would	inevitably	follow	on	the	heels	of	the	Confederation’s sudden	departure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	weren’t	around	long	enough,	however,	to	see	any	of	this	happen.	One moment	the	nine	Unity	ships	were	bearing	down	upon	them,	and	the	next	the Confederation	was	falling	into	orbit	about	Chastity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	had	no	time	to	voice	his	shock,	nor,	he	suspected,	did	the	Unity ships	upon	which	the	Confederation	rained	its	terror	as	it	swept	into	orbit, grazing	through	the	upper	layers	of	the	atmosphere	and	swinging	out	again toward	T’Chau.	It	all	happened	so	quickly,	the	moments	dreamlike	in	the unreality	of	their	passing.	And	then	they	were	accelerating	away	from	sun	and planet,	out	towards	T’Chau,	towards	the	cloud	of	debris	that	Takiro	of	the McLuhan	had	told	them	about.	It	was	their	only	option,	because	they	couldn’t phase-shift	again	so	close	to	Chastity	and	before	the	drive	had	spooled	up	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	by	the	time	they’d	reached	a	safe	distance	from	the	planet	they	would	be too	close	to	the	scattered	mass	of	the	planetesimals	to	even	dare	contemplating another	jump. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	saw	Jhordel’s	strategy	now:	They	would	dive	into	the	cover	of	the rocky	debris	and	wait	until	they	could	safely	make	a	run	for	T’Chau.	It	was	a wait	he	feared	might	be	a	terribly	long	one,	given	that	the	Unity	would	be reacting	to	this	incursion	as	might	hornets	whose	nest	had	suddenly	been	rudely shaken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	remained	unperturbed,	displaying	the	same	outward	calm	that Imbrahim	had	seen	in	her	since	first	setting	foot	on	the	Confederation.	He wondered	if	there	was	anything	that	could	pierce	that	armor	of	discipline	and steely	nerve	and	rattle	her	cage;	he	wasn’t	sure	he	wanted	to	encounter	anything</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>that	could.	Because	whatever	it	was,	it	would	have	to	be	truly	terrible. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a><b class="calibre3">14. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	surprised	to	see	her	there,	alone	in	the	darkened	observation	lounge, staring	out	at	the	drift	of	rubble	that	might	once	have	been	a	planet.	At	first	he considered	leaving,	then	decided	against	it.	A	part	of	him	thought	that	perhaps here,	away	from	the	elements	that	were	synonymous	with	her	command,	he might	see	some	part	of	her	she	hadn’t	yet	revealed	to	him.	Perhaps	some	truth that	would	make	her	that	much	less	an	enigma	and	that	much	more	a	simple human	being. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Commander,”	Jhordel	said,	without	turning	from	the	large	blister	of	a viewport. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	did	you	know	it	was	me?”	he	asked,	settling	into	one	of	the	high-backed chairs	beside	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled	but	didn’t	look	at	him.	“The	sound	of	you,”	she	told	him.	“You’re not	a	spacer.”	She	gave	him	a	cursory	look,	then	settled	back	into	her	chair	and returned	her	gaze	to	the	view	beyond	the	ship.	“Much	too	noisy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	try	to	be	more	quiet	in	the	future,”	he	grunted	sourly,	not	pleased	with being	reminded	that	on	this	ship	he	was	the	odd	man	out.	And	thinking,	too,	that she	was	not	just	meaning	his	movement	when	she	charged	him	with	being</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘noisy.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	the	way	you	walk.	Spacers	have	a	certain	rhythm	that	comes	from	years of	moving	in	light	gees.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	had	my	share	of	space	travel,”	he	said	archly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,”	she	said,	amused.	“So	I	understand.	But	you’re	not	of	a	ship, Commander.	And	if	you’re	not	of	a	ship,	you	can’t	understand	what	it	is	to	be	of one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	chose	a	different	way	to	serve,”	he	said	defensively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Indeed.	And	one	I’m	sure	has	served	Fleet	well.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>“I	like	to	think	so.	I’ve	always	done	what	they’ve	asked	of	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Without	questioning	why	it	must	be	done?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	Admiralty.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	chuckled	softly.	“They’re	only	people	like	you	and	me,	Commander.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Except	that	the	future	of	the	Empire	rests	squarely	on	their	shoulders,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	credit	them	with	too	much,	Commander.	Our	future	belongs	to	us	all, and	we	all	have	a	part	to	play	in	it.	We	all	have	a	say	in	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	stared	out	the	viewport	and	said,	“Is	this	doing	our	part?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	been	given	a	mission,	Commander.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	frowned	and	regarded	her	narrowly.	“With	all	due	respect,	sir,	we	were assigned	to	find	out	what	happened	to	the	Niagara.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	doesn’t	mean	we	must	ignore	the	main	purpose	of	our	existence.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which	is?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed,	and	there	was	something	of	a	cruel	edge	to	her	laughter	that	sent a	shiver	through	him.	“To	destroy	the	Unity,	Commander,”	she	said.	“In	any	way we	can.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To	‘destroy’	them?”	He	suddenly	felt	uneasy	sitting	there	next	to	this	woman</p>
<p class="calibre1">—fearful	of	what	she	was	capable	of	doing.	Again	he	saw	that	part	of	her	that had	made	her	the	potent	threat	she	was	to	the	Unity.	That	terrifying	thing	that was	like	nothing	he’d	seen	in	anyone	else.	Not	even	in	Jackson’s	‘angels	of death,’	his	empathy	assassins,	who	had	good	reason	to	despise	the	Unity	after	it had	hunted	down	and	slaughtered	thousands	of	their	kind.	Their	enmity	he	could almost	understand.	But	not	Jhordel’s.	Hers	was	a	feral	thing.	And	he	wondered	if there	would	be	any	place	in	the	Earth	Empire	for	a	woman	such	as	she	when	this war	was	finally	over	and	the	fighting	had	stopped.	How	could	she	even	exist without	the	war,	without	the	hatred	that	seemed	such	a	vital	part	of	her	existence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	a	difficult	concept,”	she	said,	turning	to	him	and	staring	with	her</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>cold,	hard	eyes.	“Destroying	them,	I	mean.	It’s	either	us	or	them,	Commander. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	speaking	for	myself,	I	would	rather	it	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	always	believed	it	was	our	goal	to	save	the	Empire,”	he	said	quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Winning	the	war	is	an	important	part	of	that,	but	it’s	not	all	there	is	to	achieving success.	If	we	win,	we’ll	still	have	to	live	with	the	Reds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	are	no	‘ifs,’	Commander.	We	will	win	the	war.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course,”	he	said,	though	his	words	carried	less	conviction	than	hers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	silent	for	a	moment	before	she	said,	“You	believe	victory	is	simply	a matter	of	disarming	the	enemy.	Overpowering	them.	But	the	greatest	threat	of the	Red	Catholics,	Commander,	is	their	very	existence.	So	long	as	they	remain, there	can	never	be	lasting	peace.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	believe	that,”	Imbrahim	said	firmly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah!”	She	allowed	a	thin	smile	and	gave	him	a	more	sober	look.	“That’s where	you	and	I	differ,	Commander.	You’re	the	liberal	idealist	who	believes	that ultimately	good	must	prevail.	You	look	at	the	Red	Catholics	and	see	people.	I look	at	them	and	see	the	enemy.”	Her	face	hardened.	“An	enemy	that	will destroy	us	if	we	permit	it	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’d	be	no	better	than	they,	if	we	carried	this	war	on	until	we’d	completely eliminated	them,”	he	argued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	ever	said	we	were	better?”	Jhordel	snorted	and	shook	her	head.	“To	the Red	Catholics,	Commander,	I’m	the	embodiment	of	evil.	In	war,	as	in	all	things, we	each	tend	to	view	the	situation	from	our	own	perspective.	It’s	always	the other	side	that	commits	the	atrocities.	It’s	always	the	other	side	that	has	no	moral ground	upon	which	to	stand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	you	say	suggests	that	as	victors	we	should	be	magnanimous	and forgive	the	sins	of	our	enemy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	What	I’m	saying,	Mister	Imbrahim,	is	exactly	the	opposite.	The	Red Catholics	will	never	concede	they’re	wrong.	They’ll	never	see	this	war	from	any other	perspective.	We’re	driven	to	fight	by	a	need	to	defend	ourselves	and preserve	what	we	believe	to	be	the	universal	rights	of	all	humankind.	The	Reds</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>are	fueled	by	a	religious	fervor	that	is	intractable.	It	can’t	be	tempered	by	reason; it’s	a	doctrine	of	faith	that	can’t	be	questioned.	Those	who	would	do	so	are threats,	and	thus	must	be	eliminated.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Empaths,”	Imbrahim	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	the	Empaths.	Their	very	existence	challenges	the	tenets	of	the	Red Catholic	faith.	They’re	blasphemy.	An	affront	to	whatever	god	it	is	the	Red Catholics	pay	obeisance	to.	They’re	an	impurity	that	must	be	cleansed,	as	must all	unbelievers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	seem	to	understand	a	great	deal	about	the	Reds,	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	gave	him	an	odd	look.	“They’re	the	enemy,	Commander,”	she	said,	as though	that	statement	made	everything	clear.	“Above	all	else	in	war,	one	must understand	one’s	enemy.	Wars	have	been	lost	because	of	ignorance	in	this regard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	fought	because	of	it,”	he	added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	win	this	war,	Commander,	because	we’re	capable	of	understanding	the Red	Catholics.	But	they’ll	never	understand	us.	Their	faith	gets	in	the	way.	And they	have	no	desire	to	know	anything	that	doesn’t	concur	with	their	faith.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	was	silent	for	a	long	time.	Finally	he	turned	to	her	and	said,	“What if	you	were	faced	with	an	enemy	you	didn’t	know,	Captain?	What	if	it	were some	new	lifeform	whose	motives	couldn’t	be	so	easily	fathomed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	see	you’re	thinking	ahead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	may	be	nothing	to	confront,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	if	there	is,	Captain.	If	there’s	something	out	there	that	may	or	may	not	be a	threat	to	the	Empire…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shrugged.	“Then	I’ll	deal	with	it	as	I’ve	dealt	with	all	things	in	my	life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	an	edge	to	her	voice	that	hinted	at	the	painful	moments	of	her	past—</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	things	that	had	made	her	what	she	was.	For	a	moment	he	hoped	she	might</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>reveal	something	of	it,	but	that	hope	was	quickly	dashed.	“I’ll	do	what’s necessary,	Mister	Imbrahim—regardless	of	what	it	may	mean	to	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	the	ship?	The	crew?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	space,	Commander,”	she	said	as	she	got	up	from	her	seat,	“I’m	master	of their	destinies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	if	you’re	wrong?	What	if	you	make	a	mistake?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	won’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	watched	her	leave	the	observation	lounge,	Imbrahim	thought	she	was probably	right:	she	wouldn’t	make	a	mistake.	She	hadn’t	yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	what	if	she	did? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	a	feeling	they’d	all	pay	for	it	then.	And	dearly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a><b class="calibre3">15. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	simple	enough	plan,”	Jhordel	explained	to	Imbrahim	as	they	sat	on	the bridge	and	awaited	the	moment	when	the	Confederation	could	activate	its engines	once	more	and	make	a	dash	for	T’Chau.	“Submariners	would	sometimes employ	it,	back	in	the	days	long	before	we	took	war	into	space.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Submariners?”	Imbrahim	echoed,	his	close-knit	brow	suggesting	a	hint	of puzzlement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	kin,”	Jhordel	mused,	ignoring	his	confusion.	“Only	time	separates	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	had	their	heyday	in	the	twentieth	and	twenty-first	centuries.	But	they weren’t	dissimilar	to	us,	floating	about	in	a	hostile	environment,	often	working against	an	enemy	they	couldn’t	see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	wasn’t	a	student	of	ancient	warfare;	he’d	never	had	much	interest	in history—particularly	not	as	far	back	as	that.	It	had	always	been	one	of	his weaker	subjects	in	the	Academy,	which	was	perhaps	one	of	the	reasons	he’d ended	up	in	intelligence	rather	than	on	a	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sometimes	they	would	drift	with	undersea	currents,”	Jhordel	continued, using	her	hands	to	illustrate	what	she	meant.	“Those	currents	would	be	a different	temperature	from	the	surrounding	water,	helping	conceal	the submarines	from	ships	that	might	be	tracking	them	from	above.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How?”	Imrahim	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Density,”	said	Jhordel,	as	though	that	explained	it	all.	“Water	of	different temperatures	would	have	a	different	density,”	she	elaborated.	“Ships	tracking	a submarine	mainly	relied	on	a	device	known	as	sonar.	This	basically	sent	out	high frequency	sound	waves,	which	generally	reflected	off	any	solid	surface	and	were gathered	by	a	collector.	You	could	determine	a	great	deal	from	the	length	of	time it	took	the	wave	to	return.	And	by	skillful	manipulation	you	could	even	produce pictures	of	a	sort.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	see,”	Imbrahim	muttered	vaguely.	“But	what	about	the	water	temperature?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Obviously	sound	waves	would	travel	at	different	speeds	through	water	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a>different	densities.	This	could	play	havoc	with	the	readings	a	sonar	might	have. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	some	cases	the	different	densities	could	form	a	barrier	beyond	which	the	sonar couldn’t	penetrate,	and	might,	in	some	cases,	actually	be	reflected.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	a	submarine	would	drift	with	one	of	these	pockets	or	currents	of	water, hidden	from	the	enemy	as	though	wearing	some	sort	of	cloaking	device?”	He lifted	his	gaze	to	the	main	viewport	of	the	bridge	and	saw	the	field	of	debris	into which	they	had	sequestered	themselves.	“Those	rocks	out	there	are	like	our undersea	current,”	he	said,	glancing	to	Jhordel	for	confirmation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled	mischievously.	“Exactly.	And	if	Takiro	is	correct,	then	within	a few	hours	this	cloud	of	debris	should	take	us	within	reach	of	T’Chau.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	still	have	to	make	a	break	across	open	territory,”	Imbrahim	reminded her	pointedly.	“It’ll	take	several	minutes	to	reach	the	point	where	we	can	jump through	the	point.	And	by	now	the	Unity	have	no	doubt	beefed	up	security around	the	transit	points.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Naturally,”	Jhordel	agreed.	“No	one	ever	said	this	would	be	easy, Commander.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	thought	to	say	that	it	would	have	been	far	simpler	if	they	hadn’t	come	to the	Messiah	system	in	the	first	place.	But	that	was	a	non-issue	with	Jhordel;	and he	knew	broaching	that	particular	subject	again	was	not	likely	to	endear	him	to her.	If	he’d	learned	one	thing	about	this	woman,	it	was	that	once	set	upon	a particular	path,	she	wasn’t	eager	in	the	least	to	be	dissuaded	from	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ll	never	let	us	through,”	he	said,	shaking	his	head.	“They	must	have figured	out	by	now	we’re	headed	for	T’Chau.	They	know	where	we’ll	have	to make	the	jump	and	they’ll	be	waiting	for	us.	We’ll	be	sailing	right	into	a	trap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Especially	now	we’ve	given	them	time	to	prepare	themselves	and	get	organized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we’re	approaching	the	point,	we’ll	be	sitting	ducks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	dispute	that,	Commander.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	caught	his	breath,	caught	off	guard	by	this	admission. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	also	know	they’ll	be	looking	for	a	ship,”	Jhordel	added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	Imbrahim	looked	more	confused	than	ever.	“I’m	not	sure	I	understand</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a>what	you’re	driving	at,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	quite	simple,	really,”	she	said.	“You’re	no	doubt	familiar	with	the	Jarrant effect?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.”	He	recalled	his	earlier	talk	with	N’robo.	“It	deals	with	how	errant	space debris	can	be	dragged	into	transit	points	when	ships	make	the	jump.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	how’s	that	going	to	be	of	any	use	to	us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	believed	the	Pearson	FTL	is	largely	responsible	for	this	effect.	I’ve	some personal	experience	in	this	regard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	almost	smiled.	“Your	last	mission	on	the	Grand	Banks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	appear	at	all	surprised	he	knew	this,	and	continued	on as	though	he	hadn’t	interrupted.	“We	can	project	a	sufficiently	large	Pearson	FTL</p>
<p class="calibre1">field	to	drag	a	considerable	mass	out	of	this	cloud	of	debris.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Understanding	dawned	on	Imbrahim’s	face.	“I	think	I’m	beginning	to	get	the picture.	You’re	going	to	throw	rocks	at	T’Chau.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	crude	way	of	putting	it,	but	substantially	correct.	In	fact,	by	using	our Pearson	as	a	sort	of	tow	rope	we	should	be	able	to	accelerate	a	sufficiently	large chunk	of	debris	to	a	very	high	velocity.	We	can	maneuver	the	ship	so	we	follow this	in	towards	T’Chau,	using	it	as	a	shield	against	the	worst	the	Unity	can	throw at	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you’re	talking	about	activating	the	Pearson	FTL	here!”	Imbrahim	cried, appalled	by	the	notion.	“That’s	impossible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	it’s	merely	impractical.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	one	thing	to	use	the	Jarrant	effect	under	normal	circumstances,”	he	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“but	to	activate	the	Pearson	FTL	while	surrounded	by	mass	and	at	a	virtual standstill…” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>“We’re	not	going	to	make	a	jump,”	Jhordel	assured	him.	“We’re	simply	going to	warm	the	drive	to	the	graviton	field	stage.	That’s	the	edge	of	phase-shift,	but not	quite	conversion.	Hopefully	that’ll	produce	a	field	sufficient	to	envelop	this small	chunk	of	rock	we’ve	been	using	as	cover	for	the	last	few	hours.	Then	we’ll boost	with	the	sublights,	cut	them	and	the	Pearson,	give	a	blast	of	retros	so	the rock	overtakes	us,	and	then	tuck	in	behind	it	as	it	careens	towards	the	transit point.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	make	it	sound	so	easy,”	he	grunted.	“But	you’ll	have	to	push	the sublights	far	beyond	their	prescribed	parameters	to	move	something	that massive.	Even	with	the	field	effect	reducing	the	asteroid’s	mass	displacement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	what	about	when	we	jump?	What’s	to	stop	that	chunk	of	rock	from following	us	into	the	Matrix	once	we	make	phase-shift?	I	needn’t	remind	you,	of all	people,	that	a	mass	pulled	into	the	Matrix	in	such	a	way	is	going	to	follow	us on	our	chosen	line	of	transit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	follow	us,	Commander.”	Jhordel	grinned	wryly.	“Precede	us.	And	I’m counting	on	it	doing	just	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	mad!	You	have	no	idea	of	how	a	mass	that	large	will	react	once	in hyperspace.	It	might	be	uncontrollable.	And	we’ll	be	linked	to	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	may	be	right,	but	our	experience	suggests	otherwise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	why?	Why	this	insane	risk?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	it	may	be	a	saner	risk	than	coming	out	of	the	Matrix	at	the	other	end right	into	the	hands	of	whatever	destroyed	the	Niagara.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	the	whole	purpose	of	coming	to	the	Messiah	system	was	so	we could	circumvent	the	risk	of	coming	out	at	the	other	end?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	no	idea	what	we’re	dealing	with,	Commander.	That	whole	region	of space	could	be	a	deathtrap,	just	waiting	for	us	to	fall	into	it.	Our	little	rock	here will	catch	anyone	waiting	off	guard.	It’ll	at	least	prevent	us	from	ending	up	so much	space	dust	the	moment	we	drop	shift.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somehow	he	was	not	reassured	by	her	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a><b class="calibre3">16. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	the	sort	of	thing	that	Imbrahim	could	only	imagine	Jhordel	daring,	the sort	of	thing	that	would	either	make	her	an	even	more	legendary	figure	than	she already	was,	or	doom	them	all.	But	it	was	difficult	not	to	be	swept	along	by	her confidence;	she	gave	no	hint	of	doubt,	no	suggestion	she	was	anything	but certain	this	plan	would	work.	And	given	that	she’d	got	them	this	far,	he	supposed she	had	legitimate	cause	to	be	sanguine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	to	admit	the	captain	made	it	look	and	sound	so	easy	as	she	issued orders	in	a	straightforward	fashion.	From	her	manner	one	would	never	have assumed	they	were	about	to	plunge	into	a	situation	which	might	end	in	their deaths.	He’d	seen	captains	show	more	concern	when	docking	their	ships	in friendly	ports	than	what	Jhordel	now	displayed;	and	once	again	he	knew	he	was witnessing	that	contradiction	of	discipline	and	daring	that	had	served	her	so	well to	date. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	all	Jhordel’s	reserved	calm,	however,	Imbrahim	was	convinced	she	was sweating	bullets	on	the	inside.	He	couldn’t	believe	she’d	be	insensitive	to	the very	real	possibility	that	what	they	were	about	to	attempt	could	end	up destroying	them	all,	without	the	enemy	having	fired	a	single	shot	in	their direction.	It	was	all	based	on	far	too	many	assumptions—though	he	readily conceded	he	didn’t	know	enough	about	starships	to	determine	with	any	degree	of accuracy	any	deficiencies	in	the	captain’s	plan.	He	knew	only	that	he	didn’t	like it;	but	then,	there	was	very	little	he	was	finding	to	like	about	this	mission. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	began	their	climb	out	of	Messiah’s	gravity	well	and	towards	T’Chau, accelerating	at	what	seemed	to	Imbrahim	a	painfully	slow	rate.	Despite	the Pearson	FTL	field	effect,	the	rock	they	were	towing	behind	them	acted	like	a	sea anchor,	dragging	at	the	ship	as	its	sublight	engines	strove	to	overcome	the	inertia of	a	mass	they	had	never	been	designed	to	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	where	he	sat	Imbrahim	could	see	the	data	screen	that	was	the	barometer of	the	ship’s	health.	What	he	saw	didn’t	inspire	him.	All	six	of	the	sublight engines	were	operating	in	the	red	zone,	and	even	he	knew	they	could	only	do that	for	so	long.	He	wondered	if	they	could	do	it	for	long	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Other	than	the	data	screen	before	him,	there	was	no	way	of	telling	just	how</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p63"></a>successful	they	were	in	their	task.	The	forces	that	acted	upon	him	as	he	sat cocooned	in	his	chair	were	misleading,	though	they	did	give	him	some indication	the	ship	was	indeed	beginning	to	accelerate.	But	the	question remained:	Could	they	even	get	close	enough	to	the	transit	point	to	make	an attempt	at	a	jump? </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	halfway	to	the	jump	point	of	T’Chau	when	the	ship	began	to shudder.	It	was	only	a	subtle	vibration	at	first,	scarcely	noticeable,	and	certainly nothing	that	would	have	been	cause	for	immediate	alarm.	But	as	the Confederation	narrowed	the	gap	between	it	and	the	transit	point,	the	trembling became	more	and	more	pronounced,	until	Imbrahim	was	fearful	they’d	be shaken	to	pieces.	He’d	never	experienced	anything	like	it;	and	it	was	that ignorance	that	fueled	the	ardor	of	his	terror. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel’s	voice	had	a	quaver	in	it	as	she	spoke,	but	that	was	from	the	shaking of	the	ship	and	not	the	result	of	any	qualms	she	might	have.	“Prepare	to	reduce the	field,”	she	ordered.	“Wait	on	my	command.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	sir,”	said	Wethers	coolly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	glanced	at	the	first	officer	and	felt	his	stomach	knot	in	anticipation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now!”	Jhordel	commanded,	in	a	tone	that	suggested	they	couldn’t	go	one moment	longer.	“Shut	down	the	sublights	and	fire	the	port	and	forward thrusters.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	aye,	Captain.	Shutting	down	the	sublights.	Firing	port	and	forward thrusters	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly	the	forces	that	had	pushed	Imbrahim	far	into	his	seat	vanished.	He felt	blood	surge	through	his	body	like	a	wild	river;	and	the	sudden	change	left him	lightheaded	and	feeling	sick	to	his	stomach.	Then	a	gentler	force	from	what had	earlier	pressed	down	upon	him	seemed	to	raise	him	up,	pushing	at	him	from behind	and	pulling	him	to	one	side—or	perhaps,	he	thought,	pulling	him	from	in front	and	pushing	him	sideways.	He	had	no	sense	of	direction	as	the Confederation	seemed	to	peel	away	from	its	massive	charge	and	fall	behind	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	Jhordel	issued	more	orders,	and	the	enormous	chunk	of	rock	loomed	into view,	frighteningly	close.	Imbrahim	almost	cried	out,	sure	they	were	going	to crash	into	it.	His	fears,	however,	were	unfounded	as	the	ship	tucked	in	neatly</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>behind	the	rock	and	followed	it	outwards	towards	its	imminent	rendezvous	with T’Chau. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	had	all	been	easy	after	all,	though	his	stomach	and	his	nerves	told	another story. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a><b class="calibre3">17. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	less	than	five	minutes	from	the	moment	of	phase-shift	when	the barrage	of	antimatter	torpedoes	struck	the	rock	and	carved	great	gouges	out	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	powerful	was	the	force	of	the	antimatter	annihilation	that	a	mere	dozen warheads	vaporized	a	substantial	portion	of	the	rock’s	mass.	The	face	of	the asteroid	began	to	resemble	a	comet	head,	shrouded	in	a	cloud	of	dust	and	debris, which	slowly	seemed	to	bloom	outwards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More	torpedoes	fell	in	a	hail	against	the	rock,	the	resulting	radiation	blinding the	Confederation’s	forward	scans.	It	made	Imbrahim	feel	as	though	he	were encased	in	a	tomb—even	though	he	could	still	see	out	the	viewport	to	the	plain of	scarred	rock	that	was	now	surrounded	by	an	eerie	aura	of	glimmering	dust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	what	blinded	the	ship	also	served	to	conceal	it	from	the	enemy,	and	the captain	had	counted	on	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Prepare	for	transit,”	Jhordel	commanded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Activating	Pearson	FTL	for	jump,”	Wethers	announced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now,	Imbrahim	thought,	comes	the	real	test. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	had	no	idea	whether	the	drive’s	field	would	extend	far	enough	forward to	fully	envelop	the	rock,	nor	any	inclination	as	to	what	might	happen	if	it	didn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Theory	suggested	they	would	merely	jump	with	the	portion	of	rock	enclosed within	the	field.	Imbrahim	had	never	been	one	to	trust	theories;	besides,	he couldn’t	help	thinking	of	the	proscriptions	against	shifting	anywhere	near substantial	mass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	jump	was	like	falling	into	a	hole	in	the	universe;	tumbling	out	into	some place	that	was	neither	here	nor	there.	There	was	nothing	he	recognized	from previous	jumps,	no	comforting	familiarity	to	ease	his	troubled	mind.	He	told himself	that	all	jumps	were	different,	and	that	this	was	just	a	little	more	different from	the	rest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s	no	need	to	panic,	he	told	himself.	They	were	intact,	at	least.	Certainly the	jump	had	not	thus	far	resulted	in	disaster.	He	looked	to	Jhordel,	but	her	face remained	as	inscrutable	as	ever.	If	she	were	troubled	by	the	shift,	she	showed	no</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>outward	signs	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	forced	himself	to	relax.	There	was	nothing	he	could	do	about	the situation.	Nothing,	he	ventured,	that	any	of	them	could	do	about	it.	Not	even Jhordel,	for	all	the	gifts	she	might	have	been	blessed	with.	They	would	simply have	to	wait	this	one	out—and	perhaps	even	pray	it	would	have	a	happy	ending. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	the	uncertainties	of	the	shift	and	the	unknowns	that	lay	ahead, Imbrahim	found	himself	relaxing	somewhat,	convinced	as	he	was	that	they’d now	skirted	at	least	one	potential	threat	to	their	survival.	His	relief	was	short-lived,	however,	when	Wethers	announced	they’d	a	small	problem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Torpedoes,”	the	first	officer	said,	looking	over	his	shoulder	at	Jhordel.	“Must be	at	least	a	dozen	of	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	longer	confined	to	her	chair	by	the	crushing	forces	that	had	acted	upon them	all	when	the	ship	had	been	accelerating,	Jhordel	rose	and	walked	over	to Wethers’	console.	She	bent	over	and	studied	the	cube	image	rotating	before	him: it	showed	the	position	of	the	Confederation,	the	rock,	and	the	trailing	salvo	of warheads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Jarrant	effect?”	said	Imbrahim,	joining	the	two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	looked	up	at	him,	grim-faced.	“Not	a	wholly	unexpected development,”	she	confessed,	trying	to	sound	as	though	she	had	anticipated	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	it’s	one	I’d	rather	not	have	had.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	they	pose	any	threat?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	gave	him	a	withering	look.	“They’re	antimatter	torpedoes,	Mister Imbrahim,”	she	said,	making	it	clear	that	was	threat	enough.	“We’ve	dragged them	into	hyperspace	with	our	FTL	field.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	long	until	impact?”	Imbrahim	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	way	of	knowing,”	said	Wethers.	“They’re	not	behaving	as	we’d	expect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	seems	to	be	holding	them	at	bay	for	the	moment,	but	the	instant	the field	is	shut	down,	that	may	all	change.	Those	babies	could	begin	to	accelerate again—far	faster	than	we	can.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a>“And	we	have	to	first	clear	this	rock	before	we	can	even	think	of	making	a	run for	it,”	said	Jhordel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	surely	the	ship’s	shields—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	only	handle	so	much,”	she	interrupted	brusquely.	“There’s	no	way	they can	absorb	and	dissipate	that	much	energy	all	at	once.	The	forces	transmitted through	the	shields	to	the	ship	would	crush	the	hull	as	though	it	were	made	of paper.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	has	happened	before,”	said	Imbrahim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded.	“Yes.	But	we	seem	to	have	literally	put	ourselves	between	a	rock and	hard	place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	might	have	been	a	joke,	but	it	wasn’t.	He	stared	at	her,	and	realized,	with mounting	horror,	that	she	had	made	a	mistake.	Suddenly	she	was	very	much more	human	to	him;	but	he	found	himself	feverishly	wishing	she	were	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	we	do?”	he	asked	in	a	strangled	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	regarded	him	with	a	quite	reserve.	“We’ve	time	yet,”	she	said.	She turned	and	moved	back	to	her	chair,	settling	into	it	quietly.	“I’ll	think	of something,”	she	assured	them	all.	She	planted	her	elbow	on	the	arm	of	the	chair and	rested	her	chin	on	her	closed	fist,	and	sat	there,	unmoving,	staring	ahead through	the	main	viewport	at	the	bleak	expanse	of	rock	that	careened	through hyperspace	ahead	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	studied	her,	thinking	that	perhaps	in	this	situation	she	might	reveal some	signs	of	vulnerability.	She	did	not.	And	he	was	thankful	for	this,	having quickly	come	to	the	conclusion	that	he	didn’t	want	her	to	be	a	mere	mortal.	He needed—they	all	needed—her	to	be	more	than	that.	Much	more,	if	they	were	to survive. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a><b class="calibre3">18. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	been	lucky,”	said	Jhordel,	addressing	the	others	seated	about	the briefing	room	table.	“It	appears	the	Unity	torpedoes	have	been	caught	in	a distortion	within	our	Pearson	FTL	field.	Normally	they	would	probably	have continued	along	their	trajectory	until	impact.	The	distortion	appears	to	be holding	them	in	stasis.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	take	it	the	mass	of	the	rock	we	brought	into	the	shift	with	us	has	something to	do	with	this	distortion,”	said	N’robo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded.	“It	would	seem	so,”	she	agreed.	“Certainly	this	shift	was	like	no other	we’ve	made.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	hope	there	aren’t	any	other	surprises,”	Imbrahim	muttered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	glanced	at	him	sharply	and	said,	“Unfortunately,	Commander,	there’s no	way	of	knowing	that.	We	can	only	hope	the	line	in	the	Matrix	we’ve	chosen wasn’t	also	distorted	by	the	extremes	of	the	mass	we	shifted.	But	there’re	no guarantees;	and	there	remains	the	possibility	that	we’ll	yet	encounter	the unexpected.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	happens	when	we	drop	shift?”	asked	the	chief	security	officer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	can	only	guess,	Mister	Thorn,”	the	captain	said.	“But	the	torpedoes	were almost	certainly	accelerating	towards	us	when	we	made	the	jump.	The	Jarrant effect	pulled	them	in	with	us	and	the	distortion	in	the	field	has	temporarily	halted their	advance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	we	may	safely	assume,”	said	the	chief	engineer,	from	where	she	sat	at the	far	end	of	the	table,	“that	the	moment	we	drop	shift	they’ll	close	the	gap	and impact	on	our	shields.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel’s	features	tightened	as	she	nodded	in	Soulin	Mahre’s	direction.	“Since their	engines	were	operative	when	they	were	drawn	into	the	distortion,	it	seems likely	the	moment	the	field	collapses	and	they’re	released	from	the	distortion, they’ll	be	active	again.	Certainly	far	more	quickly	than	we	can	possibly	hope	to be.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a>“What	you’re	saying	is	that	there’s	no	way	to	avoid	them,”	said	Imbrahim, feeling	the	knot	that	had	been	tightening	in	his	gut	tighten	all	that	much	further. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our	best	estimates	are	that	we’ll	have	less	than	five	seconds	before	they	hit our	shields,”	said	Jhordel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	the	laser	cannons?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Inoperable	during	hyperspace	transit.	And	there	simply	won’t	be	enough	time once	we	drop	shift.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	blew	out	a	breath	of	exasperation	and	ran	a	splay-fingered	hand through	his	wiry	hair.	“Then	we’ve	cooked	our	own	goose,”	he	grunted.	He really	wanted	to	say	to	Jhordel:	“You’ve	killed	us	all.”	He	held	his	tongue, however,	knowing	there	was	nothing	to	be	gain	from	such	an	outburst. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	hardly	done	for	yet,”	said	the	captain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	up	at	her,	a	feeble	glimmer	of	hope	coming	to	life	in	him.	“You have	a	plan,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An	option,”	she	corrected.	She	slowly	looked	around	at	the	others,	studying the	expectation	that	shone	brightly	in	the	eyes	of	each.	“We	could	leave	it	to chance	and	hope	the	distortion	has	eliminated	the	problem	for	us.	There’s	the possibility	that	when	we	drop	shift	the	engines	in	the	torpedoes	will	remain silent.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	a	likely	possibility,	I	gather,”	said	N’robo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	she	said	soberly.	“Not	likely	at	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	what’s	the	alternative?”	asked	Wethers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	can’t	destroy	them	with	the	lasers,”	said	Jhordel,	“but	we	may	be	able	to disable	them	in	another	manner.	At	the	very	least,	we	may	be	able	to	trigger them	before	they	reach	our	shields.	There	would	still	be	considerable	radiation	to deal	with,	but	we’d	have	more	chance	of	surviving	that	then	direct	annihilation against	our	shields.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	do	you	propose	to	trigger	them?”	asked	N’robo. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p70"></a>“The	distance	between	us	and	the	chunk	of	debris	we	brought	into	hyperspace with	us	is	a	fraction	of	the	distance	between	the	Confederation	and	the	Unity torpedoes.”	Jhordel	placed	her	forearms	on	the	table	and	leaned	toward	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	probably	have	about	five	seconds	to	play	with	when	we	come	out	of	shift, which	will	give	us	enough	time	to	fire	a	salvo	of	our	own	torpedoes	at	the	rock in	front	of	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wethers’	face	brightened.	“Of	course,”	he	said.	“The	blast	of	dust	and radiation	should	sweep	past	the	ship	and	form	a	barrier	between	us	and	the incoming	torpedoes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	will	it	be	sufficient	to	fool	the	torpedo	proximity	fuses	into	thinking they’ve	struck	a	ship’s	shields?”	asked	Mahre. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	shrugged.	“We’ve	no	way	of	knowing,”	she	admitted.	“But	I	don’t	see we’ve	any	choice.	It’s	either	this	or	sit	and	take	our	chances	that	their	engines will	be	dead	or	that	we’ll	somehow	miraculously	survive	the	bombardment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	doing	this	will	be	cutting	it	close.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	must	we	wait	until	we	drop	shift	before	launching	our	own	torpedoes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">asked	Imbrahim.	“Wouldn’t	it	be	more	practical	to	fire	them	before,	ensuring	the radiation	and	the	dust	get	between	us	and	the	Unity	warhead?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mahre	shook	her	head.	“The	radiation	from	the	annihilation	of	so	many torpedoes	at	once	would	be	devastating	in	the	confined	environment	of	the	FTL</p>
<p class="calibre1">field,”	she	explained.	“Other	ships	have	survived	one	or	two	blasts	in	space,	but never	anything	on	the	scale	we’re	talking	about.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	the	ship	is	generating	the	field,”	the	engineer	said,	as	though	that made	it	all	clear.	“The	immense	blast	of	energy	from	the	annihilation	of	so	many torpedoes	would	follow	the	lines	of	the	field’s	force	and	be	funneled	straight down	into	the	Pearson	FTL	generator.	The	shields	would	be	ineffective	in	this situation;	and	the	generator	would	almost	certainly	overload	and	destroy	the	ship in	short	order.	The	coils	would	collapse	into	singularities,	which	would	in	turn quickly	consume	one	another	and	any	surrounding	matter.	Without	the	FTL	field, however,	the	energy	won’t	be	confined.	The	ship’s	shields	should	be	able	to	deal with	most	of	what	will	strike	us	and	warp	it	about	the	ship,	though	at	such	close range	the	effect	will	be	considerable	and	may	result	in	some	damage	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>Confederation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Far	preferable	to	sustaining	the	simultaneous	impact	of	a	dozen	or	so torpedoes,”	Jhordel	noted.	“We	know	for	a	certainty	the	ship	can’t	survive	that sort	of	bombardment	all	at	once—even	without	the	field	active.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	if	this	doesn’t	work?”	Imbrahim	looked	anxiously	at	them	all,	then focused	his	attention	on	the	captain.	“What	if	the	radiation	and	dust	from	the strike	against	the	rock	fail	to	trigger	the	torpedoes	before	they	reach	us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	we’ll	know	within	a	matter	of	seconds,	Commander,”	said	Jhordel dryly.	“And	then	it’ll	all	be	academic.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	flopped	back	in	his	chair	and	swallowed	the	lump	in	his	throat.	A desk	job	was	beginning	to	look	mighty	good	just	about	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a><b class="calibre3">19. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">He	held	his	breath	as	the	six	torpedoes	leapt	the	gap	between	the Confederation	and	the	rock.	There	was	not	even	time	to	count	before	six	tiny sparks	bloomed	into	six	miniature	suns,	quickly	expanding,	growing	into	one amorphous	mass	that	rose	upwards	and	outwards,	a	great	bubble	of	radiation	and debris	that	engulfed	the	ship	like	the	hand	of	a	giant	closing	into	a	fist.	There was	no	sound	from	without,	but	the	ship	within	seemed	to	sag	and	groan	under the	impact.	The	shields	absorbed	and	diverted	much	of	the	onslaught,	but	even still,	some	of	the	energy	from	the	annihilation	was	transmitted	to	the	hull. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	needless	as	it	was,	Imbrahim	gripped	the	arms	of	his	chair	and	stared	at	the blinding	white	fog	that	now	filled	the	expanse	ahead	and	made	the	bridge’s	main viewport	appear	incandescent.	Of	the	rock,	he	could	see	nothing,	nor	did	the scans	register	anything	of	consequence,	blinded	as	they	were	by	the	enormous blast	of	radiation.	Within	himself	the	shrill	scream	of	his	panic	was	deafening, but	he	contained	it,	wrestling	with	the	terror	that	made	his	heart	a	hammering piston	and	the	surge	of	his	blood	a	wild	river	in	his	ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Confederation	shook,	trembling	its	entire	length	as	some	of	the	energy	the shields	could	not	bleed	off	and	warp	away	was	carried	to	the	hull.	Alarms bleated	like	wounded	sheep,	beaconing	for	attention,	and	everywhere	there	were voices	calling	out	in	organized	chaos.	The	bridge	was	plunged	into	inky darkness,	a	thick,	black	curtain	that	was	pierced	only	by	the	stabbing,	intense glow	that	came	from	beyond	the	main	viewport. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	seemed	like	minutes	had	passed,	and	yet	it	had	scarcely	been	more	than three	or	four	seconds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thunder;	and	then	silence.	Eerie.	Deathlike.	Foreboding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	struck	the	Confederation	with	such	force	that	she	was	sent careening	into	the	cloud	of	dust	that	still	grew	in	the	airlessness	of	space	before them.	Imbrahim	closed	his	eyes	and	stole	a	breath,	and	thought	this	must	surely be	his	last.	But	the	horrifying,	death-rendering	crunch	of	ship	against	rock	that he’d	been	anticipating	didn’t	come.	The	frigate	tumbled	through	a	cloud	of debris,	tiny	rocks	no	larger	than	a	flitter	striking	against	the	shields	and	bouncing off	into	space.	The	massive	chunk	they’d	carried	forth	with	them	as	a	shield	was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a>no	more.	Perhaps	weakened	by	the	shift	and	earlier	bombardments	from	the Unity,	it	had	been	blasted	into	oblivion	by	the	Confederation’s	torpedoes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shattered,	its	jagged	pieces	spinning	aimlessly	off	into	space	like	so	many marbles	tossed	across	a	polished	floor,	it	was	now	useless	as	a	shield.	But	it	had served	a	purpose;	and	Imbrahim	watched	the	drift	of	its	remains	and	breathed	a quiet	thank	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a><b class="calibre3">20. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	moved	quietly	from	bed	to	bed,	pausing	at	each	to	offer	words	of encouragement	to	the	injured,	the	depths	of	her	concern	etched	clearly	across	her face.	Imbrahim	watched	her	from	the	entrance	to	the	sickbay,	conscious	of	the fact	he	didn’t	belong	here.	He	was	an	outsider.	Not	a	part	of	this	crew.	Not	a spacer.	It	was	difficult	for	him	to	feel	a	sense	of	place	in	this	tragedy;	he	didn’t see	he	had	a	role,	as	so	clearly	all	the	others	did.	It	was	as	though	he	were	a stranger	at	a	funeral,	detached	from	the	mourners,	studying	them	in	their	grief with	an	almost	clinical	apathy.	A	stranger	who	didn’t	know	the	dead,	didn’t understand	the	pain—couldn’t	relate	to	it.	A	stranger	who	didn’t	see	that	coffin being	lowered	into	the	ground	as	anything	more	than	polished	wood	and gleaming	brass	fittings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	didn’t	know	these	people,	didn’t	wholly	comprehend	them.	He’d never	heard	their	voices,	never	heard	their	laughter	or	seen	their	smiling	faces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	tried	to	think	of	them	he	could	feel	nothing,	even	though	he	so desperately	wished	he	could.	He	wanted	to	feel	the	pain	of	loss,	for	that	would have	meant	that	in	some	small	way	he	belonged.	But	there	was	nothing.	No	dull ache	of	emptiness.	No	sense	of	injustice.	No	despair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	merely	stood	and	watched;	and	if	he	felt	anything	it	was	a	sense	of	envy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These	men	and	women	had	each	other.	They	shared	common	bonds:	this	ship, the	war,	and	space.	There	was	little	to	link	him	with	them.	Even	his	war	was different	from	theirs.	He’d	never	been	a	part	of	the	battles	waged	in	space,	had never	seen	the	mass	death	that	so	many	of	them	had	witnessed.	His	had	been	the secret	war—the	war	of	stealth.	The	war	of	shadows.	Skulking	about.	Espionage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">True,	he	had	seen	his	share	of	horror,	but	it	had	never	been	personally	linked to	him.	Not	in	the	way	that	it	had	so	often	been	for	the	members	of	this	crew,	and the	crews	of	the	many	other	ships	serving	the	cause	of	the	Federation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	another	way	in	which	they	differed,	he	realized:	they	were	family. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	worked	with	others	in	Naval	Intelligence	over	the	years,	but	he	had	never felt	close	to	any.	There	had	seldom	been	friendship.	Certainly	never	anything	as deep	as	love.	Perhaps	there	had	been	something	defensive	about	that,	because from	one	week	to	the	next	you	could	never	be	sure	where	you	would	be—and whether	or	not	you	would	be	alive	or	dead.	On	the	ships,	however,	you</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a>developed	a	sense	of	community.	On	the	ships	you	shared	your	experiences	with your	crewmates.	There’d	never	been	anyone	with	whom	he	could	share	his. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	I	die	tomorrow,	nobody	will	mourn	me,	he	thought.	Not	as	Jhordel	now mourned	those	who	had	been	lost	on	this	day.	It	shouldn’t	have	mattered;	for when	you	were	dead	you	were	dead.	But	he	found	it	meant	a	great	deal	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Especially	now.	He	couldn’t	help	but	think	of	the	close	calls	they’d	had	thus	far, and	of	what	might	lie	ahead	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	very	real	possibility	he	would	die	out	there,	far	from	the	Empire, far	from	whatever	place	it	was	that	he	called	home.	And	no	one	would	care.	Few would	even	notice.	For	his	superiors	his	loss	would	simply	be	another	irritating hole	in	the	roster	that	they	would	have	to	fill.	An	inconvenience	to	be	bitched about,	as	though	it	were	entirely	his	fault.	And	to	those	who	had	worked	with him	at	some	time	or	another?	He	doubted	they’d	feel	any	different	from	what	he would	in	the	same	situation:	They	would	merely	view	it	as	another	reminder	of their	own	mortality,	another	reason	to	be	even	more	vigilant.	But	they’d	shed	no tears.	He	never	had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	tried	to	convey	these	thoughts	to	Jhordel,	and	was	surprised	when	she	told him	she	envied	him.	“War	would	be	so	much	easier	if	there	were	no	emotions involved,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	not	machines,	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	glanced	up	at	him	wearily,	looking	as	vulnerable	as	he	had	ever	seen	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	Commander,	we’re	not.	But	maybe	we	should	be.	It’d	be	so	much	easier	if we	were.	It	wouldn’t	be	so	difficult	to	bear	the	guilt	for	the	loses	we	incur.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	blame	yourself	for	these	deaths?”	He	regarded	her	with	a	warring	mix	of disbelief	and	cynicism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	else	is	there	to	blame,	Mister	Imbrahim?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	this	is	all	part	of	war.	You	can’t	assume	responsibility	for	the	death	of every	man	or	woman	who	may	die	under	your	command.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	sighed	loudly.	“You	still	don’t	understand	how	it	is	out	here,	do	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	said	quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>He	didn’t	respond,	stung	by	the	words.	After	his	thoughts	of	moments	earlier it	hurt	to	be	reminded	yet	again	that	he	was	an	outsider. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On	a	ship	in	space,	Commander,	there	is	but	one	person	to	make	decisions and	one	person	to	assume	responsibility	for	those	decisions,”	she	said.	“They’re one	and	the	same.	When	one	assumes	the	mantle	of	captain,	one	assumes	much more	than	merely	the	command	of	a	ship.	There	is	also	the	crew	to	whom	you’re responsible.	Their	lives	are	in	your	hands.	Your	mistakes	aren’t	merely	errors that	may	cost	you,	but	failures	for	which	they	may	pay	even	more	dearly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’d	all	be	dead	now	if	not	for	you,”	he	insisted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	ran	her	hands	through	her	hair	and	gulped	a	breath	of	air.	“We wouldn’t	have	been	in	the	situation	we	were	if	not	for	me,”	she	said,	exhaling	the words	in	a	throaty	whisper.	“I	gambled	with	their	lives,	Commander.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t	that	what	every	captain	must	do	at	some	point	or	another	in	his	or	her career?”	He	was	surprised	to	hear	himself	say	this,	after	all	his	criticism	of	her decision	to	go	to	the	Chastity	system	in	the	first	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	separates	the	good	commanding	officers	from	the	bad,	Mister Imbrahim,	is	that	the	good	ones	make	the	right	decisions.”	And	with	that	she	left him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stood	just	outside	the	sickbay,	watching	her	solitary	figure	move	down	the corridor	towards	the	bridge.	It	was	then	he	realized	there	was	someone	on	this ship	even	more	alone	than	he.	Strangely,	he	didn’t	find	any	comfort	in	that thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a><b class="calibre3">21. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">They	held	a	somber	ceremony	in	the	main	hangerbay.	Imbrahim	attended because	he	felt	to	do	otherwise	would	only	serve	to	further	isolate	him	from these	people.	But	he	wasn’t	comfortable	there,	standing	stiffly	at	attention	in	his dress	uniform,	listening	to	the	spiritual	guide	read	passages	from	the	Ship’s Book.	He	listened,	but	he	didn’t	really	hear.	It	was	difficult	to	pay	attention	to anything	but	the	rows	of	plastic	cylinders	neatly	arrayed	on	the	deck.	So	many	of them;	and	each	contained	a	body,	or	what	remained	of	one.	Under	normal circumstances	they	would	have	been	launched	into	a	decaying	orbit	about	a planet,	there	to	burn	up,	shining	one	last	time.	But	there	were	too	many	to discharge	in	the	traditional	manner,	and	out	here	there	was	no	place	but	the	cold, black	depths	of	space	to	which	they	could	be	consigned.	No	one,	least	of	all Jhordel,	was	willing	to	give	them	over	to	that	unknown	darkness.	So	when	the eulogies	had	been	said	and	the	various	ceremonies	conducted,	those	assembled to	pay	their	respects	would	leave	the	bay,	and	the	long	lines	of	coffins	would remain,	until	there	was	a	place	suitable	to	which	they	could	be	committed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Federation	space,	he	supposed—though	he	couldn’t	see	the	difference	between one	emptiness	and	another.	Perhaps	it	all	had	to	do	with	what	they	were	and	why they	did	what	they	did.	He	didn’t	know.	He	didn’t	think	he	could	ever	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	it	was	all	over	Imbrahim	made	his	way	quickly	back	to	his	cabin,	and sat	for	a	long	time	in	darkness,	staring	out	the	viewport	at	the	endlessness	of space,	wondering	what	reason	there	was	for	why	he	had	survived	and	so	many others	had	not.	Of	course,	there	was	no	logic	to	it.	He	knew	that.	Nearly	sixty men	and	women	lay	encased	in	plastic	in	the	main	hangerbay,	now	lifeless	where once	they’d	been	full	of	laughter	and	hope	and	love—and	all	those	other remarkable	qualities	that	made	a	person	a	human	being	and	not	a	machine.	There was	no	reason	why	he	should	have	been	one	of	them;	nearly	nine	hundred	others had	survived	along	with	him.	And	yet,	he	could	not	help	feeling	guilty.	Perhaps because	he	had	seen	the	grief	and	sorrow	in	so	many	of	those	faces	in	the hangerbay.	There	had	even	been	tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	some	reason	he	couldn’t	avoid	the	feeling	that	because	he	had	lived, another	had	died.	And	because	he	wasn’t	a	part	of	this	crew,	it	was	difficult	not to	wonder	if	there	were	some	who	might	even	resent	that	he’d	escaped	death while	one	of	their	colleagues	had	perished. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a>Paranoid	foolishness,	he	told	himself;	but	still,	the	thoughts	persisted	in haunting	him.	Perhaps	more	so	because	there	was	a	part	of	him	that	was	thankful it	had	been	them	and	not	him.	A	part	of	him	that	was	thankful	to	be	alive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	never	feared	death,	but	he	had	always	held	tenaciously	onto	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a><b class="calibre3">22. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ship	had	been	seriously	damaged.	They	now	had	but	four	sublight	drives, which	was	just	one	more	than	the	minimum	for	phase-shift.	The	hull	had	been breached	in	several	locations,	some	of	which	would	require	the	considerable facilities	of	a	space	dock	to	adequately	repair.	They	had	lost	power	in	some sections	of	the	ship,	making	it	difficult	to	move	from	one	deck	to	another	and leaving	the	air	only	partially	purified	because	of	a	reduction	in	the	number	of operable	scrubbers.	Many	of	the	stern	sensors	had	been	fried	by	the	blast	of radiation,	so	that	the	ship	was	nearly	blind	in	its	aft	quarter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	good,”	was	Jhordel’s	broad	assessment	of	the	situation.	Had	she	been any	other	captain	in	the	fleet,	Imbrahim	ventured	that	she’d	have	used	this	as	an excuse	to	turn	back	and	limp	home.	But	the	thought	had	clearly	never	crossed her	mind.	Perhaps,	he	thought,	she	had	never	entertained	the	notion	because	to do	so	would	mean	that	the	lives	thus	far	lost	had	been	for	naught—except	for	the symbolic	strike	they’d	made	against	the	Unity	in	its	heartland.	But	that	had	little meaning,	he	told	himself;	it	could	have	done	little	to	the	Reds	save	remind	them that	they	weren’t	quite	as	invincible	as	they	might	imagine.	And	it	had	been	an unauthorized	action,	which	Jhordel	would	have	had	to	have	explained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	walked	the	corridors	of	the	ship	in	the	aftermath	of	their	narrow	escape from	annihilation,	Imbrahim	noted	a	change	in	the	mood	of	the	crew.	There	was a	noticeable	air	of	tension,	an	edge	to	the	collective	sensibility	of	these	men	and women,	which	he	had	not	observed	before.	He	had	the	feeling	it	wasn’t something	new;	indeed,	it	was	quite	likely	more	common	than	not	of	a	ship	that spent	so	much	time	in	the	thick	of	things.	Still,	it	stood	in	marked	contrast	to	the eagerness	and	fevered	excitement	he’d	felt	from	them	earlier,	when	they’d	been preparing	to	drop	into	the	Messiah	system.	But	they’d	been	caught	up	in	the exhilaration	of	the	moment,	then—driven	by	their	lust	to	draw	blood	from	the enemy.	There’d	been	a	sense	of	purpose	to	it	all:	striking	a	blow	for	the Federation.	Revenge.	Now,	as	they	waited	for	the	ship	to	be	made	ready	for	the rest	of	the	voyage,	there	was	too	much	time	to	think,	too	much	time	to	dwell upon	what	had	happened.	In	particular,	too	much	time	to	consider	those	men	and women	who	now	lay	in	death’s	embrace	down	there	in	the	gray	cavern	of	the main	hangerbay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	many	times	had	they	faced	the	same	thing?	he	wondered.	Probably	after</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>every	battle,	when	the	adrenalin	had	died	down	and	sober	second	thought	had taken	hold.	Probably	then,	when	they’d	had	time	to	reflect	upon	what	had befallen	them,	and	when	they’d	had	a	chance	to	sit	back	and	assess	the	damage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	at	that	point,	he	imagined,	that	the	deaths	became	more	meaningful.	That was	when	one	would	have	time	to	shed	tears	for	fallen	comrades.	In	battle, however,	there	was	no	time	for	tears,	nor	for	compassion.	A	soldier	did	his	job, because	if	he	didn’t,	then	somebody	else	might	die.	Perhaps	even	that	soldier himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	think	they	blame	the	captain?”	he	later	asked	N’robo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some	might,”	the	medical	officer	conceded.	“On	another	ship,”	he	added pointedly.	“But	not	this	one.	They’re	fiercely	loyal	to	Captain	Jhordel.	They would	gladly	die	for	her.	And	they	know	who’s	really	responsible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	doctor	snorted	and	looked	at	Imbrahim	as	though	he	were	an	idiot.	“Why the	Reds,	of	course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course.	Still…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	love	her,	Commander.	Every	man	and	woman	aboard	this	ship.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?”	Imbrahim	wasn’t	sure	he	understood	such	devotion.	He	wasn’t	sure he	would	so	willingly	lay	his	life	on	the	line	merely	out	of	some	notion	of loyalty,	though	some	might	argue	he’d	done	just	that	by	coming	out	here.	But that	had	been	out	of	a	sense	of	duty,	and	a	commitment	to	a	cause	for	which	he had	strong	convictions.	Not	because	of	a	slavish	devotion	to	a	single	individual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	joined	the	service	because	he	had	felt	an	obligation	to	do	his	bit	for	the war	effort.	To	have	remained	at	home	on	Earth	would	have	been	unthinkable, because	the	Federation	had	desperate	need	for	men	and	women	who	could	fight the	‘good	fight.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	been	through	much	together,”	N’robo	said.	He	smiled	sadly.	“A	bond has	formed	between	the	members	of	this	crew	and	the	captain.	We’ve	shared victories—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	deaths,”	Imbrahim	interjected. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>“Aye,	and	deaths,”	N’robo	acknowledged	more	somberly.	“That	has	a	habit	of bringing	people	closer	together.	Particularly	out	here,	Commander.	In	space	we only	have	each	other.	On	a	ship	you	are	a	tiny	community	far	removed	from	the rest	of	the	universe.	Or	so	it	often	seems.	And	when	something	happens	to	one member	of	our	community,	it	affects	us	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Even	the	captain	blames	herself	for	what	happened,”	Imbrahim	pointed	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">N’robo	nodded.	“Of	course	she	does.	She	always	does,”	he	said.	“Because she’s	the	captain,	Mister	Imbrahim.	That	means	this	ship	and	all	who	sail	in	it are	her	responsibility.	It	can	never	be	otherwise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	what	she	said.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	truth	knows	only	one	face,	Commander.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	you	think	she’s	to	blame?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	believe	she’s	responsible	for	this	ship	and	its	crew.	As	such,	she’s accountable	for	all	that	happens	to	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">N’robo	held	up	his	hand	to	silence	Imbrahim.	“It’s	a	great	weight	she	carries on	her	shoulders,”	the	doctor	said.	“And	every	man	and	woman	on	board	this ship	understands	that,	Commander.	They	know	the	choices	she	makes	aren’t easy	ones,	and	that	sometimes	there	must	be	sacrifices	for	the	greater	good	of	the cause.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	they’re	willing	to	give	their	lives?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	haven’t	you	done	the	same,	Commander?	You’d	never	have	done	the things	you’ve	done	if	there	hadn’t	been	a	willingness	on	your	part	to	pay	the dearest	price	of	all.	And	certainly	you’d	not	be	here	unless	you’d	accepted	that you	might	be	called	upon	to	die	for	the	cause.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	course,	he	knew	that	N’robo	was	right.	It	annoyed	him	that	this	man	had seen	things	about	him	he’d	thought	concealed	from	others—and	sometimes	from himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a>“Tell	me,	doctor,”	he	said	quietly.	“Do	you	believe	we’ll	be	called	upon	to make	the	ultimate	sacrifice?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	already	have,	Mister	Imbrahim.	Does	it	matter	whether	it	happens	today, or	tomorrow,	or	ten	years	from	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	searched	for	words	with	which	to	argue,	but	he	found	no	grounds for	debate.	N’robo’s	words	were	true:	they	had	but	one	face. </p>
<h2 class="calibre4">23</h2>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	you	might	like	to	be	here	when	we	come	into	scanner	range	of	the Niagara’s	last	estimated	position,”	Jhordel	said.	She	glanced	over	her	shoulder	at Imbrahim,	who	had	just	entered	the	bridge	and	was	settling	into	the	chair	next	to hers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	long?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Another	five	minutes	and	our	scanners	should	be	able	to	pick	up	the	point,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	told	him.	“If	the	Niagara	is	anywhere	nearby,	we’ll	be	able	to	detect	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	felt	an	almost	giddy	sense	of	anticipation.	They	had	come	so	far	and had	been	through	so	much	to	get	here.	Now	the	moment	of	truth	awaited	them; and	he	found	he	had	no	idea	of	what	to	expect.	It	was	possible	they	would	reach the	point	and	find	nothing.	Probable,	in	fact.	There	was	no	reason	to	assume	that whatever	had	happened	to	the	Niagara	had	happened	the	moment	that	it	had come	out	of	transit.	It	might	even	be	light-years	from	the	point,	though	he doubted	that.	Doubted	it	because	he	had	a	premonition	that	part	of	the	mystery would	be	solved	in	the	next	few	minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	moving	cautiously,	the	ship	on	full	alert,	the	shields	up	and	the weapons	systems	armed.	Jhordel	was	playing	it	safe,	though	not	without intelligence.	Despite	it	having	been	weeks	since	the	disappearance	of	the Niagara	and	the	probes	that	had	been	sent	to	investigate,	there	was	no	reason	to assume	this	region	was	safe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	hot	on	the	bridge.	Partly	because	of	the	air	quality—which	had	suffered from	the	loss	of	scrubber	units—and	partly	because	of	the	tension	that	seemed	to have	seized	them	all.	As	seasoned	as	they	were,	this	crew	was	not	taking	this lightly.	Or	perhaps	it	was	more	accurate	to	say	that	they	weren’t	taking	it	lightly</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a>specifically	because	they	were	seasoned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Coming	within	scanning	range	of	the	point	now,	skipper,”	Wethers announced.	He	peered	intently	into	the	depths	of	the	Hidacki	holocube	before him,	studying	the	information	that	filled	the	space	above	his	console.	“Nothing yet,”	he	said,	with	the	air	of	someone	who	was	expecting	something…anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	divided	his	attention	between	the	tactical	monitor	and	the	first officer,	his	patience	fraying	at	the	edges.	He	kept	hoping	for	some	sign,	some indication	they	hadn’t	come	all	this	way	for	nothing.	But	even	if	the	readouts	in Wethers’	cube	and	the	tactical	monitor	had	revealed	anything,	it	was	doubtful he’d	have	recognized	it.	His	Academy	training	had	been	brief	in	these	areas,	and long	since	forgotten.	When	he	stared	into	the	field	of	the	tactical	monitor,	he’d only	the	vaguest	notion	of	what	he	was	looking	at.	For	the	most	part	it	was	a morass	of	symbols	and	intersecting	lines;	just	so	much	nonsense	to	the	untrained eye.	Visual	gibberish.	Occasionally	he	would	steal	a	glance	through	the	main viewport,	but	even	with	its	electronic	enhancement	it	was	no	match	for	the scanners.	It	showed	nothing	but	black	space	and	the	stars.	If	there	was	something to	be	found	out	there,	he	told	himself,	it	would	eventually	show	up	on	the	scans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	only	a	matter	of	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still,	the	minutes	seemed	to	last	interminably,	until	he	began	to	think	his premonition	had	been	false.	It	was	then	that	Wethers	gave	a	shout. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Picking	something	up	now,	skipper!”	he	announced	enthusiastically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Any	details?”	asked	Jhordel.	Showing	no	more	emotion	than	an	elevated calm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	exec	shook	his	head.	“Still	too	far,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Could	it	be	a	ship?”	asked	Imbrahim,	letting	his	eagerness	get	the	better	of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	way	of	knowing	yet,”	said	Wethers.	His	hands	moved	across	the	controls of	his	console,	stroking	holokeys	in	a	fluid,	practiced	manner,	fine-tuning	the instruments	that	were	the	Confederation’s	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sound	battlestations,”	Jhordel	ordered. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a>Imbrahim	marveled	at	her	composure,	and	wished	he	could	feel	as	coldly indifferent	as	she	sounded.	But	his	heart	was	racing,	ganging	about	in	his	chest; and	he	could	feel	the	sweat	beading	on	him	and	running	down	his	flesh.	He licked	his	lips	nervously,	wondering	what	it	was	he	feared	the	most:	that	what Wethers’	had	picked	up	on	the	scans	was	just	an	errant	piece	of	debris,	or	that that	thing	out	there	before	them	had	had	something	to	do	with	the	disappearance of	the	Niagara.	If	the	latter,	then	what	chance	did	they	stand	against	it?	Of course,	they	were	not	running	into	this	blind,	as	the	Niagara	surely	had.	At	the first	sign	of	trouble	the	Confederation	could	respond.	And	there	was	still	the option	of	fleeing—though	in	these	past	few	days	he	hadn’t	been	under	the impression	that	Jhordel	was	of	the	‘discretion	is	the	better	part	of	valor’	school of	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Definitely	artificial,”	Wethers	said,	his	words	almost	a	mumble	as	he continued	to	concentrate	on	interpreting	the	information	the	ship’s	computer	was throwing	at	him.	“But	not	large	enough	to	be	a	ship,”	he	added,	the	thread	of disappointment	clearly	audible	in	his	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	part	of	one,”	Jhordel	suggested	mechanically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	swallowed	and	wiped	at	his	forehead.	He	studied	the	tactical monitor	again	and	thought	he	could	make	out	the	object	Wethers	had	locked onto.	It	was	clearly	not	moving	with	any	great	speed,	if	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	far	is	it	from	the	point?”	Jhordel	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Less	than	two	million	klicks,”	Wethers	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	it’s	part	of	the	Niagara,”	the	captain	mused,	“the	ship	would	have	had	to have	been	almost	stationary	at	the	time	of	destruction.	If	the	ship	had	continued to	move	at	a	reasonable	velocity	after	coming	out	of	the	shift,	we	wouldn’t	find anything	this	close	to	the	point.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stationary?”	Imbrahim	scratched	his	head	and	frowned.	“But	why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	gave	him	a	sidelong	look.	Which	he	thought	strayed	close	to contempt.	“Physics,	Commander.	If	they’d	come	out	of	the	jump	with	standard phase-shift	velocity	any	debris	would	have	continued	on	at	the	same	velocity.	It would	be	a	lot	farther	away	by	now	than	two	million	klicks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a>“All	right.	But	then	why	would	they	have	come	out	of	the	jump	nearly stationary?	That	doesn’t	make	sense,	does	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	It	doesn’t.	Something	would	have	had	to	have	stopped	them.	Or…”	She shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or	they	could	have	decelerated	in	transit,	before	exiting	the	Matrix.	It’s	not recommended,	but	technically	it	could	be	done.	But	I	can’t	imagine	a	captain	on a	shakedown	cruise	risking	it.	Not	without	good	reason.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	what	reason	would	that	have	been?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	arched	a	brow.	“Your	guess	is	as	good	as	mine.	But	I’ll	posit	this:	It	could have	been	what	destroyed	the	ship.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	it	was	destroyed,”	Imbrahim	said,	a	touch	too	testily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	afraid	it	looks	like	it	was,	Commander,”	Wethers	interjected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both	Jhordel	and	Imbrahim	turned	to	the	first	officer	expectantly.	He	wore	a cheerless	look	as	he	said,	“There’s	no	question	about	it	now:	that	thing	out	there is	part	of	a	ship.	Looks	like	the	remains	of	a	Pearson	FTL.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	still	no	certainty	it	was	from	the	Niagara,	but	Imbrahim	had	little doubt	it	was.	What	he	was	less	sure	of	was	whether	or	not	the	ship	had	met	its fate	by	some	freakish	accident,	or	by	hands	unknown.	And	if	the	latter,	what chance	did	they	stand	against	such	an	incredible	force,	damaged	as	they	were?	If he	had	been	a	betting	man,	he’d	not	have	given	them	fighting	odds.	Perhaps ironically,	only	because	of	Jhordel	would	he	give	them	a	chance	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a><b class="calibre3">24. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	more	debris,	much	of	it	floating	in	a	tenuous	cloud	far	from	the initial	find	of	the	drive	section.	The	Confederation	had	halted	amidst	this	cloud, drifting	with	it,	giving	the	tech	teams	a	chance	to	assess	just	what	it	was	they’d found.	To	Imbrahim,	watching	it	tumble	about	from	the	safety	of	the	observation lounge,	it	was	all	nondescript.	He	could	identify	none	of	it;	it	was	just	twisted metal,	charred	and	melted,	looking	as	though	it	had	been	through	an	enormous shredder.	He	had	never	seen	anything	like	it,	nor	had	many	of	the	crew	if	he	read them	correctly.	It	left	him	cold,	because	he	kept	hearing	the	screams	of	the thousands,	cut	short	as	air	quickly	vanished	and	bodies	suffered	the	horrors	of exposure	to	the	vacuum	of	space. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	gives	one	pause	to	think,	doesn’t	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	glanced	over	his	shoulder	to	see	N’robo	standing	in	the	doorway.	“I thought	I	was	the	only	one	without	anything	to	do,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	much	need	for	my	services	on	this	one,	I’m	afraid.”	The	doctor	stepped deeper	into	the	room,	coming	to	stand	abreast	of	Imbrahim.	He	was	silent	for	a long	time,	his	eyes	fixed	on	the	wreckage,	watching	it	drift	about	them	as	though he	were	studying	fish	in	a	tank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	seen	a	ship	swallowed	by	the	singularity	formed	after	the	collapse	of	its coils,”	he	said	at	length.	“It	was	very	quick,	very	painless.”	He	said	it	with	a clinical	disregard.	“There	was	nothing	left.	Not	a	single	molecule.	It	was	difficult to	feel	anything.	But	this,”—he	lifted	his	arm	and	gestured	towards	the	twisted debris—“is	like	coming	across	the	dead	on	a	field	of	battle	after	the	bombs	have stopped	falling	and	the	smoke	has	cleared.	There’s	something	far	more	sobering about	it.	Here’s	something	tangible,	something	we	can	touch.	A	connection	to the	past,	to	those	sorry	wretches	who	once	proudly	crewed	that	ship.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	drew	a	shuddering	breath	and	then	expelled	it	slowly	in	a	manner that	suggested	a	desperate	struggle	to	reconcile	himself	with	what	had	happened here.	“I	keep	asking	myself	what	could	have	done	such	a	thing,”	he	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	we	should	not	be	asking	‘what,’	but	‘who,’	Commander.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>“Meaning?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Meaning	that	it	doesn’t	seem	likely	this	would	have	been	the	work	of	the Unity,”	N’robo	explained.	“To	begin	with,	the	relatively	slow	drift	of	the	debris suggests	the	Niagara	was	nearly	at	rest	when	it	was	destroyed.	When	the	ship dropped	shift	it	appears	to	have	come	to	a	stop	almost	immediately.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	captain	thinks	deceleration	in	transit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?”	N’robo’s	eyebrows	shot	up.	“Well,	she’d	know	better	than	I.	I’m	a meat	man,	and	I’ve	never	been	inclined	to	take	a	viral	about	spatial	mechanics and	transiting	dynamics.	Can’t	see	the	sense	of	filling	my	limited	brain	capacity with	all	those	equations.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quite,”	Imbrahim	muttered,	surprised	to	hear	that	the	argument	he’d	often used	on	himself	now	didn’t	seem	so	reasonable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	they	came	out	slow,”	N’robo	mused,	scratching	his	jaw.	“Must	have	been a	reason	why	they	did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Surely	not	an	imprudent	course	of	action	when	entering	unexplored	space,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	argued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	suppose.	But	in	that	case	they’d	have	also	come	out	with	shields	up	and	in	a defensive	posture.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	proscribed	procedure	in	the	manuals.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">N’robo	guffawed.	“I’d	think	by	now	you’d	realize	the	manuals	were	written by	a	bunch	of	overzealous	theorists.	They	based	a	lot	of	their	proscriptions	on untested	theory	and	supposition.	Most	of	those	have	been	proved	false	by	the actions	of	various	captains,	including	our	own.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	haven’t	always	been	wrong.	There’s	the	Phoenix.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	that	I’ll	give	you.	Though	one	can’t	be	certain	that	wasn’t	as	much	the work	of	the	singularity	down	on	the	surface	of	Trillium	as	anything	else.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	what	does	that	leave	us?”	asked	Imbrahim.	“If	it	wasn’t	technical problems	that	destroyed	the	Niagara	and	it	wasn’t	the	Unity,	then	what	was	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a>“Ever	see	one	of	those	ancient	maps	of	the	world,	Commander?	The	ones from	about	the	seventeenth	and	eighteenth	centuries.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry.	I’m	not	much	of	a	history	buff.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you	an	officer	and	all.”	The	doctor	shook	his	head	dismissively.	“Can’t beat	history	for	shedding	light	on	the	present,”	he	said.	Then	he	gave	a	little shrug	of	his	shoulders	and	observed:	“The	captain	takes	history	very	seriously.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Especially	her	own	it	would	appear,”	Imbrahim	said	under	his	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	was	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing,	doctor.	Just	muttering	to	myself.”	He	glanced	at	N’robo	and	quickly added,	“You	were	telling	me	about	maps.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye.	I	was.	They	used	to	have	on	them	these	places	where	they’d	draw	sea serpents	or	the	like.	Places	unknown,	yet	to	be	explored,	or	where	ships	had	been lost	exploring.	Near	them	they’d	note:	Here	be	dragons.	Or	something	like	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here	be	dragons?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">N’robo	regarded	him	somewhat	sardonically	and	said,	“Perhaps	it	isn’t	only	in the	sea	where	you	find	monsters,	Commander.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	looked	at	the	remains	of	the	Niagara	and	shivered. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a><b class="calibre3">25. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">He	found	her	in	her	office.	The	door,	as	always,	was	open;	she	prided	herself on	always	being	available	to	her	crew.	But	he	wasn’t	one	of	hers,	so	he	hesitated, rapping	lightly	on	the	wall	outside	and	looking	in	questioningly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	in,	Mister	Imbrahim,”	she	said,	looking	up	briefly	to	acknowledge him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stepped	through	into	the	tiny	office	and	stood	before	her.	“Do	you	have	a moment,	Captain?”	he	ventured. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	pushed	away	from	her	desk	and	leaned	back	in	her	chair.	She	sat	there a	moment,	not	saying	anything,	staring	up	at	him,	studying	him.	“Something	on your	mind,	Commander?”	she	said	at	length. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About	our	mission,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	have	some	concerns?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	some	difficulty	understanding	why	we’re	remaining	here,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our	mission	was	to	determine	the	fate	of	the	Niagara,”	Jhordel	said,	as though	that	explained	everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	shifted	uneasily.	“I’ve	talked	to	Commander	Mahre	and	she	says	the tech	teams	have	all	the	information	they’re	going	to	get	from	this	wreckage.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	she	said	simply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	wouldn’t	it	be	prudent	to	set	course	for	home?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	cocked	her	head	to	one	side,	regarded	him	curiously.	“Why?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	we’ve	got	what	we	came	for,”	he	said,	a	his	temper	a	little	short. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	know	what	happened	to	the	Niagara.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	we?”	Jhordel	sat	up	straighter,	looked	surprised.	“You	must	know something	I	don’t,	Commander.	Correct	me	if	I’m	wrong,	but	currently	we	know</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>nothing	more	than	the	fact	that	the	Niagara	was	destroyed	and	that	it	appears	to have	been	by	some	outside	agency.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	nothing	more	to	be	resolved	by	sitting	around	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	may	be	right,”	she	agreed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	cut	him	off	with	a	sharp	gesture,	then	allowed	one	of	her	feral	grins,	faint, cruel,	and	maybe	even	a	little	scary.	“You	may	be	right,	but	you	may	also	be wrong.	What	happened	to	the	Niagara	could	well	have	been	pure	chance,”	she said.	“On	the	other	hand,	it	may	not	have	been.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	closed	his	eyes	and	swallowed.	“You	think	whoever	did	this	to	the Niagara	could	come	back,”	he	said,	his	voice	scarcely	audible	against	the incessant	background	hum	that	permeated	the	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	see	you’ve	come	to	the	same	conclusion.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,”	he	breathed.	“And	it’s	for	that	reason	I	believe	we’d	best	be	served	by returning	as	quickly	as	possible	to	Earth.	We	need	to	warn	them,	while	we’ve still	a	chance	to	do	so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Warn	them	about	what?”	Jhordel	asked,	spreading	her	arms.	“We	haven’t	a clue	as	to	what	did	this	to	the	Niagara.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Surely	knowing	that	it	was	done	is	enough!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	there’s	a	genuine	threat	to	the	security	of	the	Earth	Empire,	Commander, then	it’s	our	duty	to	determine	just	what	that	threat	is.	Admiralty	didn’t	send	us all	this	way	merely	to	confirm	what	they’d	already	concluded.	I	can	guarantee you	they	won’t	be	satisfied	with	a	few	pieces	of	a	debris.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	didn’t	send	us	here	to	end	up	like	the	Niagara,	either.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Believe	me,	Commander,	I	value	my	life	as	much	as	you	do	yours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	for	myself	I’m	concerned,”	Imbrahim	said	stiffly.	“I	keep	thinking	of the	Niagara	and	those	people	down	in	the	hangerbay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a>She	stared	back	at	him	with	eyes	that	had	suddenly	gone	cold	as	ice	and	as hard	as	stone.	“This	is	a	war,	Mister	Imbrahim.	People	die	in	wars.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With	all	due	respect,	Captain,	it’s	not	necessary	that	any	more	people	die here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	harsh	look	on	Jhordel’s	face	now	seemed	to	turn	to	a	dark	fury;	and Imbrahim	began	to	wonder	if	he’d	pushed	too	far.	He	had	hoped	to	manipulate her,	to	use	what	N’robo	had	told	him	about	her,	to	prey	upon	her	conscience	and the	sense	of	responsibility	she	felt	for	ship	and	crew.	But	the	tempest	that	raged across	her	face	suggested	he	may	have	erred	in	playing	this	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stood	tense,	his	muscles	aching	from	standing	so	still,	his	mouth	gone	dry, his	stomach	knotted.	He	stood,	and	waited,	hoping	the	storm	would	pass,	hoping the	discipline	so	integral	a	part	of	her	would	temper	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Every	man	and	woman	on	board	this	ship	is	aware	of	the	risks,”	she	said	in measured	tones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	sir,	I	don’t	think	they	are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	leaned	back	farther	in	her	chair,	lips	drawn	in	a	tight	line	as	she	regarded him	through	narrowed	eyes.	“So,	Commander,”	she	said,	“you’ve	suddenly become	an	expert	on	spacers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	stared	back	at	her,	this	time	not	letting	himself	be	unnerved	by	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	seen	my	share	of	death,	Captain,”	he	said	bluntly.	“Whether	I’m groundling	or	spacer,	it	makes	no	difference	to	the	truth	of	that	particular	reality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	see	those	people	down	in	the	hangerbay,	or	when	I	see	the	remains	of	the Niagara,	it	means	the	same	to	me	as	it	does	to	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does	it,	Commander?”	Jhordel	growled.	Then,	in	a	low	voice,	“Do	not presume	to	believe	that	you	know	anything	about	me,	Commander.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	ignored	this,	though	inside	he	thought	he	was	digging	himself	a	grave.	He said,	“The	mission	is	complete,	Captain.	Admiralty	expects	no	more	of	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	long	silence,	and	he	could	see	her	marshalling	a	calm,	reining	in whatever	furies	had	been	loosed	within	her.	At	length	she	said,	“I	disagree, Commander.	I	think	Admiralty	expects	much	more	of	us.	But	even	were	you</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a>right,	on	this	ship	we	ask	more	of	ourselves	than	merely	achieving	the	bare minimum	expected	of	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	sure	of	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does	it	require	we	take	a	vote?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	it	does,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sat	up	and	drew	closer	to	her	desk.	“You’re	dismissed,	Commander,”	she told	him	as	she	settled	back	to	her	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir?”	Imbrahim	blinked,	startled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	not	a	democracy,	Commander,”	she	said,	looking	up	at	him	sharply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Surely—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	intensity	of	her	look	sharpened	to	a	glare	as	she	cut	him	short.	“What happens	to	this	ship	and	its	crew	are	my	responsibility,	Mister	Imbrahim.”	Her voice	was	almost	a	physical	lash	against	him,	brooking	no	argument.	“It’s	not your	place	to	question	that,	unless	you’re	considering	removing	me	from command.	Do	I	make	myself	clear?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,”	he	replied,	the	word	a	strangled	sound	in	his	throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	glad	we	understand	each	other.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perfectly,	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	retreated	from	the	office,	feeling	as	though	he’d	just	been	put through	the	wringer,	and	realizing	why	Jhordel	was	such	a	formidable	opponent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	when	he	thought	of	the	Niagara,	he	wondered	if	even	she	could	be sufficiently	redoubtable	to	confront	and	survive	what	might	lie	ahead. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a><b class="calibre3">26. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	alarms	jarred	him	from	a	fitful	sleep.	Imbrahim	opened	his	eyes	to	the eerie	red	glare	of	battlestations,	and	saw	on	the	com-link	near	his	bed	the winking	beacon	that	called	for	‘all	hands	on	deck.’	He	rolled	out	of	his	bed	as	the first	blow	struck	the	ship,	and	was	promptly	sent	sprawling.	As	he	picked himself	up,	a	second	impact	rocked	the	vessel.	He	grabbed	for	a	nearby handhold	and	held	on	tight,	wondering	what	the	hell	was	happening,	and realizing	almost	as	quickly	that	it	must	be	what	he’d	feared	most. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	only	seconds	to	pull	on	his	uniform	and	boots,	an	exercise	made	all	the more	difficult	by	fluctuating	g-forces.	Less	than	five	minutes	after	the	first	alarm had	sounded,	Imbrahim	stumbled	out	into	the	corridor	of	the	officers’	deck	and headed	towards	the	bridge.	There	were	lights	flashing	everywhere	in	a bewildering	pattern	that	seemed	to	work	in	harmony	with	the	constant	blare	of the	alarms	and	the	shouted	orders	that	came	over	the	ship-com. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	others	in	the	corridors,	some	headed	aft,	towards	engineering, others	fanning	out	to	the	various	operational	sections.	He	crashed	into	someone as	the	ship	was	rocked	yet	again,	and	discovered	it	was	N’robo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	happening?”	he	demanded	as	he	clutched	at	the	chief	medical	officer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">N’robo	gave	him	a	withering	look,	but	before	he	could	say	anything	another alarm	sounded,	this	one	louder	and	more	shrill	than	the	others.	The	doctor	cursed loudly	and	looked	frantically	about.	Others	were	doing	the	same,	and	then running	as	though	their	lives	depended	upon—which	they	did,	as	N’robo’s	next words	confirmed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	pity’s	sake,	Imbrahim,	find	an	ESC	and	strap	yourself	in!”	he	shouted above	the	scream	of	the	alarm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	stared	at	him	blankly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on!”	N’robo	grabbed	him	by	the	arm	and	dragged	him	down	the corridor.	Here	and	there	along	the	way	there	were	alcoves	carved	into	the	walls, their	transparent	plaz	coverings	in	place	and	the	red	lights	of	occupation indicating	there	were	already	crewmembers	in	them.	But	N’robo	found	one	that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a>was	vacant.	He	shoved	Imbrahim	forcefully	into	it	before	the	commander	could muster	a	protest,	pulled	down	the	padded	restraining	bar	to	activate	the	unit,	and stepped	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	Imbrahim’s	horror	the	plaz	facing	of	the	ESC	slid	across	the	opening, effectively	sealing	him	in.	He	heard	the	hiss	of	air,	and	numerous	other	ominous sounds	as	the	unit	came	up	to	speed.	A	panel	to	the	left	of	him	winked	with	a pattern	of	readouts	he	was	too	dazed	to	make	sense	of;	and	as	he	stood	there, restrained	by	the	bar,	a	cocoon	of	bladders	enveloped	him,	much	as	they	would have	in	a	crash	couch.	He	felt	their	suffocating	embrace,	and	with	it	a	surge	of panic.	He’d	always	been	terrified	of	these	things,	and	had	only	ever	had	cause	to use	them	in	training.	That	had	been	more	than	enough	to	convince	him	his	career wasn’t	as	a	regular	on	ships. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helpless	and	in	the	dark,	drowning	in	the	chaos	that	now	submerged	him,	he stood	there,	waiting.	He	had	never	used	an	Emergency	Survival	Chamber	on	a ship	before	and	realized	now	how	woefully	inadequate	the	simulations	had	been. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	the	time	he’d	been	on	this	ship	he’d	never	given	them	a	moment’s	notice—</p>
<p class="calibre1">though	every	day	he’d	passed	them	as	he’d	walked	through	the	corridors.	They were	ubiquitous.	Had	to	be,	because	when	a	ship	went	into	combat	maneuvers there	was	no	guarantee	all	the	crew	would	have	immediate	access	to	crash couches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	ignored	them,	because	he	had	never	imagined	having	to	use	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	he	was	painfully	aware	of	their	claustrophobic	confines,	and	bluntly reminded	of	their	purpose.	Belatedly,	he	wished	he’d	never	left	the	safety	of	his cabin.	He	probably	shouldn’t	have,	not	being	one	of	the	crew.	He	wasn’t	even sure	why	he	had,	except,	perhaps,	because	of	foolish	curiosity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	steel	leech	of	the	auxiliary	pump	and	drug	infuser	unfolded	from	the	wall close	to	his	head,	its	electric	whine	sending	a	shiver	down	his	spine.	He	couldn’t turn	his	head	to	see	it	fully,	but	he	could	see	the	glint	of	its	sinuous	chrome umbilical	out	the	corner	of	his	eye.	It	latched	onto	him,	pressing	against	his flesh,	a	cold	mouth	of	metal	teeth	sucking	at	the	skin,	drawing	his	life	into	it	and pumping	a	witches’	brew	of	superoxygenated	blood	and	chemicals	into	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shivered,	uncontrollably,	and	tried	to	wrestle	with	his	panic.	He	closed	his eyes	tight	and	made	an	effort	to	remember	his	training,	to	recall	emergency procedures	for	combat	maneuvers	while	in	a	ship	under	attack.	But	all	he	could</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a>recall	was	how	he	had	always	hated	it,	how	the	simulations	had	panicked	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	more	reason	why	the	course	of	his	destiny	had	been	steered	towards	Naval Intelligence	and	away	from	the	ships. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ship	moved,	accelerating	at	an	incredible	rate,	so	that	a	crushing	force came	smashing	into	him	like	some	great	hammer	blow	smiting	him	the	length	of his	entire	body.	He	would	have	cried	out,	but	there	was	no	breath	in	his	lungs	nor the	strength	with	which	to	do	so.	A	red	fog	enveloped	his	eyes,	blurring	his vision,	which	was	rapidly	narrowing	to	a	tunnel	and	fading	to	black. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	could	still	hear	the	alarms,	blaring	incessantly,	shrill	voices	that	now seemed	distant,	screaming	to	him	across	the	great	ocean	of	his	diminishing consciousness.	Desperately	he	struggled	to	maintain	equilibrium,	to	hold	onto that	last	thread	of	awareness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	heard	his	heart,	a	great	thumping	engine	in	the	cavern	of	his	chest, straining	against	forces	humans	hadn’t	been	designed	to	bear.	Machines	were	the thin	tissue	of	security	between	life	and	death	here,	he	reminded	himself;	he would	have	been	dead	in	seconds	if	not	for	the	gravity	dispensators	and	the mechanisms	of	this	chamber	that	now	worked	in	unison	to	keep	him	alive.	But how	frail	and	tenuous	that	tissue:	so	easily	torn.	Just	one	good	hit,	one	fateful penetration	through	the	shields,	and	every	man	and	woman	on	board	this	ship would	die	in	an	instant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	seemed	an	eternity	that	he	was	encased	in	the	high-tech	sarcophagus.	The	g-forces	dropped	to	more	tolerable	and	less	painful	levels,	clearing	his	vision	and allowing	him	to	breathe—though	barely.	He	knew	they	were	no	longer maneuvering,	for	the	force	against	his	body	was	constant	now,	and	not	the conflicting	whirlpool	that	had	played	around	him	moments	earlier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Straight-line	flight,	he	told	himself;	it	meant	the	Confederation	was	running,	still accelerating	towards—	Towards	what?	The	transit	point? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peering	forward,	he	saw	the	play	of	lights	across	the	face	of	the	plaz, reflections	from	the	panel	near	his	head.	He	turned	his	attention	to	this,	moving his	eyes	more	than	his	head,	and	saw	the	readouts	more	plainly	than	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	made	sense	to	him:	g-force	levels,	air	pressure,	his	vital	signs,	corridor integrity,	and	a	dozen	or	so	other	bits	of	data	that	informed	him	he	was	alive	and that	the	ship	was	as	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>He	studied	the	chrono	and	was	surprised	to	see	it	read	his	time	in	the	chamber as	having	been	less	than	ten	minutes.	His	body	said	otherwise;	it	was	as	though he	had	suffered	a	twelve	round	bout	with	a	professional	fighter.	Everywhere ached,	despite	the	drugs.	When	he	drew	in	a	breath	his	rib	cage	was	lanced	with pain,	like	hot	needles	being	drawn	through	his	flesh.	But	as	agonizing	as	that was,	it	was	far	preferable	to	being	dead—which	at	least	the	hurt	assured	him	he was	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	waited,	impatient,	fearful,	trying	not	to	imagine	what	might	happen	next.	It was	a	difficult	task,	ensconced	as	he	was	in	the	chamber,	helpless	to	do	anything, hoping	to	hear	something	from	the	bridge	and	frightened	he	never	would.	They might	even	all	be	dead	up	there	in	the	bow	for	all	he	knew.	The	ship	might simply	go	sailing	on	aimlessly	into	darkness,	while	they,	like	Egyptian	pharaohs in	their	tiny	tombs,	waited	for	a	release	that	would	never	come. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ship	jumped. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a><b class="calibre3">27. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our	casualties	were	limited,”	the	woman	across	from	Imbrahim	said.	He looked	at	her	in	disbelief,	and	wondered	how	she	could	sit	there	and	say	that with	such	seeming	calculation.	Particularly	in	light	of	the	fact	that	she	was	here making	her	pronouncement	because	of	one	of	those	casualties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	many	serious,	lieutenant?”	asked	Jhordel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ten	dead,	Captain,”	said	the	assistant	medical	officer.	“Another	twenty-three in	critical	condition.	There	were	some	minor	injuries	people	incurred	while getting	to	the	ESCs.	A	few	side-effects	from	the	drugs.”	She	made	it	sound	as though	it	were	routine,	as	though	she	were	reading	off	a	grocery	list,	the	dead and	the	dying	nothing	extraordinary.	Imbrahim	supposed	that	for	a	medical officer	on	board	a	frontline	warship	the	latter	might	well	be	true.	Perhaps	such individuals	had	to	become	detached,	or	in	a	very	short	time	they’d	likely	be driven	mad	by	the	horror	of	it	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	would	seem	to	have	come	through	this	quite	well,”	the	captain	observed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	gaze	slowly	patrolled	the	perimeter	of	the	table,	surveying	the	faces	of	her command	officers,	shrewdly	evaluating	each	individual,	seeing	in	those	faces things	Imbrahim	couldn’t.	But	even	he	could	feel	the	change	in	mood,	which now	seemed	more	subdued,	with	less	eagerness	and	enthusiasm	than	he	recalled of	the	previous	briefings.	He	wondered	how	much	that	had	to	do	with	the absence	of	the	good-humored	N’robo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	few	more	minutes	of	debating	technical	issues,	Jhordel	dismissed	them all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	started	to	leave	with	the	others,	but	at	the	door	to	the	briefing	room he	hesitated.	The	panel	slide	shut,	leaving	him	alone	with	the	captain.	He	turned slowly	and	walked	back	to	the	table,	standing	there	at	the	end,	looking	down	the length	of	its	polished	black	surface	to	where	she	sat.	She	was	looking	out	the viewports,	her	back	to	him,	seemingly	unaware	of	his	presence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	N’robo?”	he	demanded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	Jhordel	was	startled,	she	did	a	good	job	of	concealing.	When	she	looked	at</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a>him,	it	was	as	though	she	had	expected	him	to	be	there.	“What	would	you	have me	say?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wasn’t	sure.	He	felt	angry,	felt	consumed	by	a	sense	of	injustice.	But perhaps	worst	of	all,	he	felt	guilty.	N’robo	had	sacrificed	himself	for	Imbrahim; he	hadn’t	made	it	to	an	ESC	before	the	maneuvers	had	begun.	And	Imbrahim couldn’t	help	thinking	that	if	he’d	just	done	what	he	was	supposed	to	do	and	not ventured	forth	from	the	safety	of	his	cabin	during	the	emergency—</p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	did,	he	told	himself;	and	another	had	paid	the	price.	So	why	am	I	angry with	her? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because	she	hadn’t	listened	to	him.	Because	she’d	refused	to	consider retreating	to	the	safety	of	Federation	space. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because	in	a	way	she	was	responsible	for	the	doctor’s	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	thought	to	tell	her	these	things,	but	then	recalled	what	N’robo	had	once said	of	her.	And	as	he	looked	at	her,	studying	that	bruised	and	weary	face,	he saw	the	haunted	look	in	her	eyes.	Saw	the	death	there.	Saw	it	and	shuddered,	for it	was	more	terrifying	than	any	of	the	carnage	he’d	recently	witnessed	on	this ship.	It	spoke	of	defeat	and	utter	dismay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	something	you	haven’t	told	us,”	he	said	bluntly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	say	anything	at	first,	but	merely	regarded	him	with	a	resolute	look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	she	said,	“When	we	jumped,	Commander,	I	controlled	the	shift.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	see.”	Or	so	he	thought	he	did.	“We’re	not	headed	for	Federation	space.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	catch	on	quickly,	Mister	Imbrahim.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	I’m	sure	the	rest	of	the	crew	will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	time,”	she	agreed.	“Some	before	others.	Wethers	already	knows.	Most	of the	bridge	crew	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	you	think	everyone	has	the	right	to?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	think	it’ll	make	a	difference?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a>“It	doesn’t	matter	whether	it	will	or	not,”	he	insisted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	swiveled	her	chair	away,	and	stared	again	at	the	ghostly	aura	of hyperspace.	“They’ll	know,	Commander,”	she	said	quietly.	“But	for	now	there’s a	ship	to	be	repaired	and	order	to	be	restored.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	snorted.	“What	for,	Captain?	So	that	we	can	go	back	and	let	ourselves	be pounded	again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	won’t	be	necessary	to	do	that,”	she	said.	She	turned	her	head	and	looked	up at	him.	“Our	enemy	has	followed	us	into	hyperspace,	Commander.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a><b class="calibre3">28. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	impossible,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	us,”	Jhordel	agreed	quietly.	“But	clearly	those	whom	we	now	flee	have technological	skills	we	do	not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	always	thought	only	the	Jarrant	effect—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded.	“And	I.	But	we’ve	managed	to	get	an	aft	scanner	operational since	the	jump,	and	it	clearly	indicates	there’s	something	running	the	same	line of	the	Matrix	as	we	are,	far	beyond	our	Pearson	FTL	field.	The	only	explanation is	that	they’ve	the	capability	of	tracking	a	ship	through	the	jump	and	into hyperspace.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	struggled	with	this	a	moment,	trying	to	accept	it,	but	not	wanting	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stared	unfocused	at	the	table,	seeing	its	polished	black	surface	as	though	it were	a	window	looking	out	onto	the	future.	The	vision	that	swam	before	his	eyes was	not	a	pleasant	one:	he	kept	seeing	the	Niagara,	the	twisted	and	charred remains	of	it,	tumbling	end	over	end	through	the	airless	black	sea	that	was	space, moving	aimlessly	where	once	it	had	sailed	forth	with	purpose.	He	thought	of	the thousand	and	more	crew	who	had	died	in	it,	thought	of	their	screams,	blunted	by the	sudden	suffocation.	The	hard	vacuum,	leaving	them	without	breath,	letting gases	bubble	out	in	the	bloodstream.	If	they	hadn’t	died	the	instant	of	the	ship’s death,	then	theirs	would	have	been	a	horrid	last	few	seconds.	Perhaps,	he thought,	some	might	even	have	lasted	long	enough	to	register	what	was happening,	to	know	that	the	pressure	in	their	bodies	would	soon	overcome	them and	be	their	undoing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	felt	sick	to	the	stomach.	What	would	it	be	like?	he	wondered.	What	ran through	the	mind	in	a	situation	like	that?	He	wasn’t	sure	of	the	exact	details, knew	only	the	popular	myths	of	holodramas.	Gruesome,	horrible	ends	in	those. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bodies	exploding	and	freezing.	He	supposed	there	was	little	truth	to	that.	But still…	The	internal	pressures	of	the	body	and	all	would	wreak	havoc.	And without	sunlight,	heat	from	the	body	would	rapidly	be	dissipate,	radiating	into that	boundless	emptiness.	He	didn’t	suppose	it	really	mattered	exactly	what	the gruesome	details	were.	In	the	Academy	they’d	always	reminded	you	of	one thing:	Dead	is	dead,	and	it	doesn’t	matter	how	it	happens. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a>Imbrahim	had	always	known	he	would	one	day	die,	but	he	didn’t	want	to	die like	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a><b class="calibre3">29. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	it’s	not	them,”	he	said	hopefully,	desperate	to	find	some	other	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	would	even	rather	it	be	the	Unity.	At	least	against	the	Reds	they	would	have	a fighting	chance.	But	if	a	ship	like	the	Niagara	could	be	so	easily	dispatched,	then what	hope	had	they? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	considered	all	possibilities,	Commander,”	Jhordel	assured	him.	“But	one must	apply	Occam’s	Razor	to	this	particular	situation.”	She	paused,	seeming	to gather	herself	as	she	turned	and	rested	her	forearms	on	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	hundreds	of	light-years	from	Federation	space,”	she	said	tonelessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	a	war	on,	so	it’s	difficult	to	imagine	ships	from	either	the	Federation	or the	Unity	being	sent	out	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	swallowed	his	words	of	protest,	because	he	knew	there	was	little sense	in	fighting	her	simple	logic.	Why,	indeed,	would	any	other	ships	be	this	far out? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	are	they?”	he	asked	in	a	thin	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	enemy,	Commander.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a><b class="calibre3">30. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	can’t	run	forever,”	said	Imbrahim.	“The	line	we’re	following	in	the Matrix	has	to	come	out	somewhere.	When	it	does,	they’ll	follow	us	out.	In hyperspace	we	have	the	restraints	of	the	Matrix	to	keep	them	from	accelerating past	us.	But	once	we	drop	shift—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	cut	him	off	with	a	severe	look.	“I’m	well	acquainted	with	the	scenario, Mister	Imbrahim.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	sir,”	he	said,	subdued.	He	wiped	his	face	with	one	hand	and	looked beyond	the	captain,	eyes	fixed	on	the	eerie	vista	of	hyperspace,	trying	to	see	far astern	to	the	other	ship.	Who	or	what	were	they?	What	sort	of	beings	walked	the decks	of	that	vessel? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	blinked	and	regarded	Jhordel	dazedly,	unaware	that	he	had	spoken	aloud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	what,	Commander?”	she	repeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	afar	again,	and	said,	“Why	would	they	just	attack	us	like	that?	Why destroy	the	Niagara?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	events	in	their	past	have	given	them	cause	to	mistrust	encounters with	unfamiliar	species,”	Jhordel	suggested.	“Or	it	may	be	their	nature	to destroy.	Who	can	know?	And	does	it	matter	whether	we	do	or	don’t?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You,	yourself,	have	stressed	the	importance	of	knowing	your	enemy, Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	this	case.Commander.	I	think	it’s	enough	to	know	that	they	are	the enemy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	they?	If	we	could	communicate—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	attacked	us,	Mister	Imbrahim,”	Jhordel	said	bluntly.	“It	seems	clear</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a>enough	they	intended	to	do	to	us	what	they	did	to	the	Niagara.	Would	you	have us	take	the	chance	of	letting	them	finish	the	job?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	what	if	they	didn’t	destroy	the	Niagara?”	he	protested.	“What	if	it	was something	else?	What	if	they	reacted	the	way	they	did	because	they	thought	we were	that	something	else?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	not	debate	this	with	you,	Commander.	I’ve	only	the	evidence	at	hand	by which	to	judge	these	matters.	And	I	can’t	take	the	chance	to	stop	and	try	to engage	them	in	a	friendly	chat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	will	it	be	then,	Captain?”	Imbrahim	asked,	his	voice	tight	with	anger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	last	stand	and	a	fight	to	the	death?	Or	do	we	keep	running	until	we	can	run	no farther?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	regarded	him	levelly.	“When	one	assumes	command	of	a	ship, Commander,	it’s	always	made	clear	to	one	that	above	all	else	one	must	never	let that	ship	fall	into	the	hands	of	the	enemy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Meaning?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Meaning	that	if	the	ship	following	us	could	so	easily	destroy	the	Niagara, then	it’s	doubtful	we	would	be	a	match	for	it.	Particularly	in	light	of	the	fact	that we’ve	sustained	considerable	damage.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	we	have	no	choice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	are	always	choices,	Commander.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	wasn’t	sure	why,	but	he	didn’t	like	the	sound	of	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a><b class="calibre3">31. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	alarm	for	battlestations	was	still	resounding	throughout	the	ship	when Imbrahim	walked	into	the	bridge.	He	paused	for	a	moment,	just	beyond	the narrow	hatchway,	studying	the	hive	of	activity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’d	better	secure	yourself,	Mister	Imbrahim,”	Jhordel	warned	from	her command	post. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	hurried	over	to	the	crash	couch	beside	hers	and	settled	into	it	quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	happening?”	he	asked.	He	tried	to	make	himself	comfortable	but	found he	was	so	tense	that	he	couldn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	gave	him	a	oblique	look	and	said,	“We’re	about	to	drop	shift.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	thought	that	he	must	have	misheard	her.	“Drop	shift?”	he	said.	He looked	forward,	to	the	bank	of	monitors,	his	eyes	fixing	upon	the	tactical	screen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	we	approaching	a	transit	point? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	the	captain	said	simply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	felt	his	mouth	go	dry.	“A	blind	drop	from	hyperspace?”	He	gaped	at	her, started	to	say,	“The	risks—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	great,”	she	cut	in.	“But	it’s	possible	we	could	escape	our	pursuers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	lose	ourselves	in	the	process,”	Imbrahim	charged.	“We	went	through	the Messiah	system	to	avoid	just	such	risks,”	he	reminded	her	pointedly.	“If	we’re lucky	enough	not	to	drop	out	in	the	center	of	a	sun	or	a	planet,	we’ll	still	be dropping	into	uncharted	territory.	We	don’t	know	this	space.	We	may	not	be	able to	find	our	way	out	of	it,	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	didn’t	look	unduly	concerned.	“I’m	well	aware	of	all	the	arguments against	it,”	she	said.	“In	ideal	circumstances	I	wouldn’t	even	consider	it.	But these	are	not	ideal	circumstances,	Commander.	In	situations	like	this	we improvise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	wondered	if	they	would	be	improvising	their	deaths. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a><b class="calibre3">32. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">They	waited	anxiously,	because	they	were	now	vulnerable.	They	had	to recharge	the	FTL	drive,	which	took	time	they	might	not	have.	And	with	just	two sublights	currently	on	line	they	couldn’t	technically	initiate	a	jump	even	when the	Pearson	was	charged	and	spun	up.	Engineering	promised	to	have	the minimum	three	drives	functioning	within	twelve	hours,	but	in	the	meantime	the crew	sat	waiting,	tense,	watching	the	scanner	readouts,	hoping	against	hope	the single	aft	sensor	would	show	nothing.	And	as	the	Confederation	continued	to sail	onward	after	its	drop,	with	no	indication	the	enemy	had	followed	them	from hyperspace,	their	situation	began	to	look	more	propitious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	felt	a	renewed	sense	of	optimism,	though	even	he	realized	it	was too	early	yet	to	declare	victory	and	count	themselves	safe.	The	fact	remained	that they	didn’t	know	the	full	capabilities	of	their	enemy,	and	could	therefore	not allow	themselves	to	become	complacent	because	of	the	seeming	success	of	this maneuver.	“Too	easy,”	Jhordel	murmured	as	she	sat	waiting	in	her	command chair.	Her	attention	was	focused	on	the	tactical	monitor,	as	it	had	been	from	the moment	they	had	dropped	shift. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does	it	have	to	be	difficult?”	asked	Imbrahim,	not	wanting	his	bubble	of	rosy optimism	to	be	so	quickly	burst. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	look	at	him,	but	said,	“It	doesn’t	appear	they	had	any	difficulty following	us	into	the	Matrix,	Commander.	Clearly	they	would	appear	to	have	a considerably	more	sophisticated	tracking	system	than	our	own.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	a	random	drop—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	cut	him	off	with	a	curt	shake	of	her	head.	“There’re	reasons	for everything,	Commander.	A	device	that	could	track	a	ship	into	hyperspace	has more	uses	for	war	than	for	peace.	And	if	they	developed	such	a	mechanism,	then it	stands	to	reason	they’d	also	have	anticipated	moves	like	the	one	we	just initiated.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	would	have	developed	some	means	of	responding	accordingly,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	said,	hollow-voiced. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>“Aye.	Not	much	use	being	able	to	track	a	ship	into	hyperspace,	only	to	lose	it because	it	dropped	shift	randomly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wrinkled	his	brow	in	a	troubled	frown.	“But	the	scans	show	nothing,”	he protested.	“We’ve	been	sweeping	the	space	about	us	for	more	than	an	hour,	and there’s	been	no	indication	of	anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our	enemy	isn’t	stupid,	Commander.”	She	turned	and	regarded	him	squarely now.	“They’re	playing	a	game	of	cat	and	mouse.	First	they’re	testing	our capabilities,	trying	to	establish	our	limitations;	and	then,	when	they’ve	formed	a reasonable	profile	of	us,	they’ll	attack.”	Her	eyes,	like	hard,	cold	bits	of	flint, bore	into	him,	as	though	dissecting	him.	“Whoever	commands	that	ship	is	doing whatever	any	good	captain	would	do,	Mister	Imbrahim:	understanding	the enemy.	Once	you’ve	done	that,	you’re	halfway	to	defeating	your	foe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	didn’t	need	to	understand	the	Niagara	in	order	to	destroy	it,”	he	said, his	voice	a	brittle	challenge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	it’s	their	intention	to	destroy	us,”	the	captain	said.	“I	think	they could	have	done	that	back	at	the	transit	point,	before	we	had	a	chance	to	jump.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	felt	his	flesh	crawl	as	the	implications	of	what	she	was	saying	sank in.	“They	want	to	know	their	enemy,”	he	whispered	with	enlightenment.	“And what	better	way	to	do	it	than	to	capture	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.”	She	stole	another	look	at	the	tactical	screen,	as	though	assuring	herself that	nothing	had	slipped	into	scanner	range.	It	was	a	personal	conceit,	given there	were	several	others	on	the	bridge	monitoring	the	situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	destroyed	the	Niagara,”	she	continued,	turning	back	to	him.	“Perhaps because	it	took	them	by	surprise,	or	perhaps	because	they	hadn’t	anticipated	it falling	so	easily	to	their	firepower.	They	may	or	may	not	know	of	the	Earth Empire.	I	tend	to	think	the	latter.	And	what	they	did	to	the	Niagara	would	have left	them	with	few	clues,	one	way	or	the	other.	But	now	we’re	here,	presenting them	with	a	chance	to	garner	a	great	deal	more	information	about	this	new enemy.	So	they	feel	us	out	with	a	few	quick	jabs.	Only	we	don’t	fold	like	they expect,	because	unlike	the	Niagara	we’ve	been	expecting	them.	Now	we’ve	got away,	and	they’ve	two	reasons	for	wanting	to	catch	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	first	is	obvious,”	said	Imbrahim.	“But	the	second?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a>“Just	as	we	don’t	want	them	getting	hold	of	any	information	concerning	where we	come	from,	they	don’t	want	us	to	get	back	home	to	spread	the	word	about them.”	Jhordel	smiled	crookedly.	“They’re	smart	little	buggers,	I’ll	give	them that.	But	maybe	not	quite	as	smart	as	they	think.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	so?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	smile	shaded	to	the	cruel,	thin-lipped	grin	of	which	he	was	all	too familiar.	“They	forget	that	two	can	play	at	this	game,	Commander.	And	in	this case	we	clearly	have	as	much	interest	in	ensuring	they	don’t	get	back	to wherever	it	is	they	came	from	and	report	on	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	thought	to	ask	her	how	she	would	stop	them,	but	knew,	even	before	he’d had	chance	to	think	the	question	through,	that	he	would	probably	not	like	the answer.	Better	that	he	remain	blissfully	ignorant,	for	now.	In	time	he’d	know what	she	intended—whether	he	wanted	to	or	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	all	would. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a><b class="calibre3">33. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">He	could	not	sleep,	though	he	felt	exhausted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	would	close	his	eyes	but	find	himself	waiting,	anticipating	the battlestations	alarm,	ready	to	prepare	himself	for	combat	maneuvers	or	another jump.	He	wanted	to	believe	they’d	somehow	eluded	their	foe,	but	Jhordel’s words	echoed	in	his	mind.	And	though	he	told	himself	she	was	simply	being overly	cautious,	he	couldn’t	bring	himself	to	dismiss	her	admonitions.	He couldn’t,	he	realized,	because	he	trusted	her	instincts	on	this	matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	rather	ironic,	he	supposed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	sat	up	and	swung	his	feet	to	the	floor.	He’d	been	lying	stretched	out	in	his uniform	for	more	than	two	hours.	Two	hours	of	pretending	he	wasn’t	afraid,	of trying	to	convince	himself	Jhordel	would	somehow	get	them	out	of	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why	he	thought	as	much	he	couldn’t	say;	there	was	a	voice	inside	him	that said	they	wouldn’t	be	here	if	she’d	listened	to	him.	They’d	be	safe	in	Federation space.	Or	somewhere	close.	But	she’d	been	right	about	determining	the	extent	of the	threat	that	had	dealt	the	fatal	blow	to	the	Niagara.	He	saw	that	now.	Finding the	remains	of	the	ship	hadn’t	been	enough;	and	her	assessment	of	Admiralty’s desires	in	this	case	were	probably	far	closer	to	the	truth	than	he	cared	to	admit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	wouldn’t	be	satisfied	with	a	simple	confirmation	of	the	Niagara’s	demise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	course,	he	observed	wryly,	they	might	not	even	get	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stood	and	made	his	way	to	the	viewport	of	his	cabin.	They	were	drifting, having	pushed	their	remaining	two	engines	close	to	the	limit	when	they’d boosted	out	from	the	drop	point.	Sublight	drives	were	temperamental	and	fragile beasts	at	the	best	of	times,	which	was	why	warships	like	the	Confederation	had six	of	them.	You	ran	a	terrible	risk	if	you	pushed	them	beyond	their	parameters; and	the	captains	of	military	ships	were	renowned	for	walking	the	narrow	line between	safety	and	disaster.	Jhordel	was	no	different	from	the	rest,	but	even	she acquiesced	to	the	entreaties	of	her	chief	engineer.	Engineering	had	shut	down	the remaining	drives	to	prevent	them	from	joining	the	four	others	that	were	off	line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile,	the	tech	teams	were	working	at	resurrecting	one	of	the	inoperative four	by	cannibalizing	the	other	damaged	drives,	because	only	with	three	fully functioning	engines	powering	them	could	they	safely	make	the	transition	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a>hyperspace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	out	and	felt	that	awful	sense	of	isolation	that	comes	from	knowing you’re	in	an	unfamiliar	place.	This	was	not	the	space	of	his	childhood	dreams.	It was	not	the	space	of	a	myriad	stars	he’d	once	stared	at	with	yearning	from	the warm	security	of	prairie	fields,	long	ago	in	those	forgotten	summer	nights	of	his youth.	It	was	not	the	space	he’d	once	imagined	sailing	through—not	the	place	of great	mystery	and	awe	that	had	captivated	him	as	he’d	read	and	watched	the exploits	of	the	countless	men	and	women	who	had	become	heroes	and	legends	in its	boundless	reaches.	And	yet,	he	told	himself,	it	was	indeed	the	same,	and	only he	and	the	ship	he	sailed	in	somehow	made	it	different. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	walked	over	to	the	mess	unit	in	his	room	and	ordered	the	machine	to fabricate	him	a	mug	of	steaming	hot	chocolate.	“With	a	marshmallow,”	he added.	A	small	hatch	opened	and	he	reached	in	and	picked	up	the	mug.	It	was warm,	and	heavy,	and	steam	rolled	and	curled	off	the	surface	of	the	dark	brown liquid,	reminding	him	of	the	mist	that	rose	from	the	river	outside	his	home	on	the cold	prairie	days	of	early	winter.	It	had	been	a	long	time	since	he’d	seen	that, longer	still	since	he’d	warmed	himself	with	a	belly	full	of	chocolate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wrapped	his	hands	around	the	mug	and	felt	the	stinging	warmth	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Almost,	he	wished	for	a	harsh	winter,	so	that	he	could	stand	at	the	window	and look	out	past	its	lace	of	frost	to	the	endless	white	of	the	fields,	warmed	by	the security	of	his	home	and	the	heat	from	the	drink	that	burned	away	the	cold	from hours	of	play	outside.	When	you	got	old	you	too	easily	forgot	those	simple pleasures,	forgot	what	it	was	to	be	a	child. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	moved	back	to	the	viewport	and	peered	out.	As	he	sipped	the	chocolate and	swallowed	the	scalding	brew,	he	felt	a	cozy	warmth	spread	through	him.	It was	a	transitory	thing;	but	for	a	moment	he	was	a	child	again,	and	that	eerie	vista out	there—far	more	severe	and	threatening	than	even	the	worst	of	prairie	winters</p>
<p class="calibre1">—was	a	place	to	feel	secure	from.	For	a	moment	he	could	feel	safe	and	warm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a><b class="calibre3">34. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	finally	gave	up	pacing	his	room	and	made	his	way	back	to	the bridge.	At	least	there	he	could	know	what	was	happening	right	away.	At	least there	he	had	less	a	sense	of	being	impotent	and	in	the	dark.	An	illusion,	perhaps, but	one	that	left	him	feeling	more	secure.	He	found	Jhordel	where	he	had	earlier parted	company	with	her,	and	surmised	from	the	look	of	her	that	she’d	never	left the	bridge.	For	a	moment	he	stood	just	inside	the	hatchway	and	studied	her, observing	how	her	concentration	never	seemed	to	waver	from	the	bank	of monitors	before	her.	They	were	her	eyes	and	ears	into	the	ship,	telling	her	of	its secrets,	warning	her	of	its	problems.	Without	that	information	she’d	be	blind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	went	to	the	mess	unit	on	the	bridge	and	ordered	up	some	coffee,	then walked	purposefully	to	the	seat	beside	her.	“Here,”	he	said,	proffering	the	drink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	look	as	though	you	could	use	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	glanced	up	at	him,	and	for	just	a	moment	he	was	sure	he	could	see	a sick	weariness	in	her	eyes.	But	if	it	was	there,	it	was	a	fleeting	thing:	gone quickly—replaced	by	that	hard	edge	of	steely	determination	that	seemed	to	be the	engine	that	drove	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,”	she	murmured,	accepting	the	coffee.	Her	gaze	didn’t	linger	on	him, but	shifted	once	again	to	the	monitors.	She	sipped	absently	at	the	drink;	and Imbrahim	was	struck	with	the	notion	that	he	could	have	handed	her	a	cup	of	mud and	she	wouldn’t	have	noticed	the	difference. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	much	longer?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Until	we	jump?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	nodded,	then	realizing	she	was	paying	no	attention	to	him,	hastily	added, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“According	to	engineering	the	tech	teams	should	have	number	five	back	on line	within	the	hour.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’ll	be	the	minimum	three.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>“Aye.”	She	blew	on	her	coffee	and	took	another	sip.	“But	the	minimum	is enough,	Mister	Imbrahim.	We	just	need	one	shift.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	shift.	One	shift	and	they’d	be	back	in	the	Federation,	or	somewhere	close. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	just	about	to	congratulate	her	on	saving	their	hides	when	something beeped	on	the	tactical	monitor.	Jhordel	jerked	upright,	her	eyes	fixed	upon	the screen,	studying	it	intently.	And	as	he	watched	her,	he	felt	the	life	drain	out	of him;	for	what	was	there,	he	was	sure,	could	only	be	one	thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	them,”	he	said,	his	voice	hoarse	from	the	sudden	dryness	of	his	throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Jhordel	ignored	him	as	she	began	issuing	orders.	The	bridge,	which	had seemed	so	quiet—almost	peaceful—moments	earlier,	was	at	once	buzzing	with activity.	People	scrambled	into	seats	behind	consoles,	mobilizing	for	action	even as	the	battlestations	alert	was	sounded.	The	chattering	of	voices	and	the	sound	of instrumentation	was	thick	in	the	air,	drowning	out	the	monotonous	beep	that came	from	the	tactical	monitor.	Imbrahim	turned	his	head	towards	the	screen	and stared	at	it.	Something	was	on	the	very	perimeter	of	the	Confederation’s scanning	range.	Five	hours	distance	at	best	sublight	speed.	Closer	if	whoever	it was	could	jump	so	short	a	distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	we’re	screwed	if	they	can,	he	thought;	for	the	Confederation	was	surely dead	if	that	were	the	case.	Not	unless	Jhrodel	could	pull	another	rabbit	out	of	the hat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wanted	to	believe	in	her.	He	wanted	to	be	like	the	rest	of	the	crew	and	have absolute	faith	in	her.	Then	there	might	be	hope,	because	without	hope	there	was nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	hope	they	were	surely	as	lost	as	the	Niagara. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a><b class="calibre3">35. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Impossible,”	said	Mahre,	shaking	her	head	vigorously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	want	to	hear	it,	Commander,”	Jhordel	said	sharply.	“We	have	less	than five	hours	to	get	that	engine	back	on	line	and	start	boosting	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t	work	miracles,	Captain,”	the	engineer	shot	back.	She	glanced	at	the other	officers	who	had	been	quickly	summoned	to	the	briefing	room,	looking	for their	support. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	isn’t	a	matter	of	choices,”	Jhordel	told	them	heatedly.	“We	either	make	a shift	within	the	next	few	hours,	or	we	face	whatever	it	is	that	destroyed	the Niagara.”	She	raked	them	with	her	eyes,	making	it	clear	to	them	that	she	didn’t want	to	hear	anything	that	even	hinted	of	accepting	defeat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	people	are	doing	their	best,”	Mahre	protested.	“But	the	random	drop	put a	lot	of	strain	on	the	ship.	We	had	to	supply	the	shields	with	an	incredible amount	of	energy.	Far	more	than	the	engines	were	designed	to	furnish.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	pursed	her	lips	and	remained	silent	for	a	minute	or	two.	Imbrabim studied	her,	trying	to	imagine	what	must	be	going	through	her	mind,	and thankful	it	wasn’t	he	who	had	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">bear	the	enormity	of	these	responsibilities.	That	she	faced	this	situation	with such	stoic	reserve	left	him	awed;	he	understood,	now,	why	she	was	so	prized	by the	Admiralty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Since	Commander	Mahre	has	made	it	clear	we	can’t	hope	to	have	the	engines back	on	line	before	our	enemy	reaches	us,	we	must	seek	an	alternative	course	of action,”	she	announced.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">favored	them	with	a	blunt	stare.	“I	need	not	tell	you	that	standing	our	ground	and confronting	them	would	be	futile.	We’re	clearly	not	in	the	condition	to	defend ourselves	against	the	likes	of	this	enemy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	alternative	is	there?”	asked	a	wide-eyed	Talud.	The	navigation	officer looked	anxiously	about,	her	sense	of	desperation	reflected	in	the	faces	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a>others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	Wethers	who	answered	her.	“It’s	theoretically	possible	to	shift	with	two engines,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Theory!”	Mahre	snorted	dismissively.	“No	one	has	proved	it.	And	all	the theories	suggest	that	without	a	substantial	source	of	gravitonic	energy	a	shift	is virtually	impossible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	was	the	Agamemnon,”	he	reminded	her.	“They	by-passed	the	sublight thrust	manifolds	and	pumped	everything	directly	into	the	Pearson.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	was	no	one	alive	after	their	shift!”	the	engineer	exclaimed.	“And there’s	still	debate	as	to	whether	they	actually	shifted	of	their	own	accord. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Besides,	they	were	in	orbit	about	a	planet.	The	mass	had	a	direct	effect	on	the coils.	It’s	why	we	don’t	shift	near	mass.	Mass	means	gravitons,	Mister	Wethers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	the	FTL	works	on	the	accumulation	of	those.	It’s	why	we	need	the	sublights to	pump	up	the	coils.	But	you	do	that	near	a	planet	and	you’ll	overload	the system,	which	is	probably	why	they	all	died.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly.	That’s	my	point:	That	much	mass	may	have	worked	against	them,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wethers	argued.	“But	without	having	to	provide	thrust	to	accelerate	the	ship,	two sublights	might	be	enough	to	pump	up	the	coils	and	give	us	what	we	need	to make	a	jump.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Academic,”	Jhordel	grunted.	“We’ve	no	time	to	debate	the	niceties	of	the matter.	The	fact	remains	that	it’s	our	only	true	alternative.	We	either	take	the	risk of	making	the	shift	under	these	parameters,	or	we	prepare	ourselves	for	an	armed confrontation	and	hope	we	can	acquit	ourselves	better	than	the	Niagara.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	long	silence	in	the	room.	They	exchanged	looks,	but	no	one	dared speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	Jhordel	rose	and	said,	“Prepare	for	the	jump.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	watched	them	leave,	stricken	by	the	somber	mood	that	seemed	to have	infected	them	all.	He	studied	Jhordel	closely,	but	she	remained	as	hard-edged	as	always,	no	hint	of	weakness	betrayed	in	her	features.	She	had	provided them	with	one	more	chance	at	survival,	weak	though	it	was.	But	soon	she’d	run out	of	options;	and	then,	he	knew,	she’d	have	but	one	left.	The	one	she’d	not	yet</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a>discussed	with	any	of	them,	but	the	one	that	was	surely	uppermost	in	her	mind	as the	enemy	drew	its	net	tighter	and	tighter	about	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a><b class="calibre3">36. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">They	jumped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	knew	the	moment	they	entered	hyperspace	that	something	was wrong.	He	might	not	be	a	spacer,	but	even	his	experience	on	ships	was	enough	to tell	him	this	wasn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">right.	It	seemed	as	though	the	ship	were	a	living	creature,	and	that	as	it	fell through	hyperspace	it	screamed	one	long,	blood-curdling	cry	of	death.	It	could have	been	minutes,	or	hours,	or	even	days	before	it	ended.	He	wasn’t	sure.	It didn’t	matter.	All	he	knew	was	that	as	they	exited	the	transit	point	at	the	end	of the	line	it	was	for	the	last	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Confederation	would	never	jump	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a><b class="calibre3">37. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Connie	lay	dead	in	space. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	what?”	asked	Imbrahim,	his	voice	a	whispered	breath	against	the uncomfortable	silence	that	permeated	the	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	said	nothing	for	a	long	time.	When	she	did	speak,	it	was	with	her usual	directness.	“We	do	what	the	Niagara	didn’t	have	a	chance	to	do,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	prepare	to	meet	our	enemy	and	destroy	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	don’t	have	the	means,”	he	protested.	“You	said	so	yourself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	Mister	Imbrahim,	that’s	not	what	I	said	at	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’ll	be	a	final	briefing	in	ten	minutes,”	she	said,	interrupting	him.	“Any questions	you	have	will	be	answered	there.”	And	with	that	she	rose	from	her	seat and	left	the	bridge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	sat	silent	for	several	minutes	after	she	had	gone,	mulling	over	her words,	increasingly	uncomfortable	with	the	implications	of	what	she’d	said.	He didn’t	need	to	go	to	the	briefing	room	to	know	what	it	was	she	was	going	to	tell them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a><b class="calibre3">38. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stood	with	her	back	to	them	and	said	over	her	shoulder,	“I	could	stand here	and	pretend	there	was	hope,	but	there	isn’t.	I’ve	often	said	there	are	always choices,	and	I	suppose	this	remains	true.	But	if	we’re	to	remain	faithful	to	what we	believe	in,	then	our	choice	is	but	one.”	She	turned	and	confronted	them, meeting	their	looks	with	an	open-faced	one	of	her	own.	“We’ve	run	as	far	as	we can	run,”	she	went	on	in	a	subdued	tone.	“Given	time,	it’s	possible	we	might engineer	a	means	of	limping	back	home.	But	time	is	something	we	don’t	have.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	you	believe	the	enemy	will	track	us	down?”	said	Imbrahim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Based	on	the	pattern	of	events	thus	far,	yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	this	last	jump	was	like	none	of	the	others,”	he	argued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“True	enough,”	Jhordel	conceded.	“And	if,	by	chance,	we’ve	managed	to elude	our	foe,	then	so	much	the	better.	The	decisions	made	in	this	room	won’t	be written	in	stone,	Commander.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	we	to	be	given	a	say	in	the	matter,	then?”	Imbrahim	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	here	because	I	value	your	input,”	the	captain	informed	them	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nevertheless,	a	warship	is	not	a	democracy.	Ultimately	it’s	I	who	must	make the	decisions;	and	in	doing	so	I	must	do	what	is	best	for	the	Federation,	and	not what	is	best	for	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	they	mutually	exclusive?”	Imbrahim	challenged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	are,	if	in	choosing	for	ourselves	we	put	the	Federation	at	risk.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	what	is	your	decision,	Captain?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	moved	to	the	table	and	sat	down.	She	was	silent	for	a	moment, rubbing	her	hands	together,	staring	at	them	contemplatively,	as	though	weighing a	matter	of	great	import—which,	of	course,	she	was.	Finally	she	looked	up	and regarded	them	knowingly.	“There	is	no	other	viable	alternative,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	studied	the	faces	of	the	others	and	didn’t	like	what	he	saw.	They</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a>wore	a	collective	look	of	resignation;	there	was	no	hint	of	anger,	nor	sense	of outrage	present	in	any	of	them.	It	was	a	calm	acceptance	he	couldn’t	understand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	while	his	own	emotions	were	a	maelstrom	of	discontent	and	disequilibrium. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wasn’t	so	willing	to	accept	Jhordel’s	assessment	of	the	situation,	even	though he	could	actually	see	no	clear	alternative	himself.	“We’ll	have	achieved nothing,”	he	argued,	turning	to	the	others	desperately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	have	bought	time,”	said	Jhordel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	how	much?”	He	shook	his	head.	“We	don’t	have	a	clue	as	to	what	we’re up	against	here.	There	could	be	a	whole	armada	of	ships	waiting	on	the Federation’s	doorstep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	not,”	said	Jhordel.	“Only	the	one	ship	has	chased	us.	We’ve	seen nothing	to	indicate	there’s	more	than	one.	If	there	were,	I’m	sure	we’d	not	be here	discussing	the	matter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	scout,”	Wethers	suggested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	inclined	her	head	in	acknowledgement.	“That	would	be	my	guess,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	admitted.	“Which	gives	us	reason	to	hope	it’s	far	from	any	fleet	it	might belong	to.	Perhaps	distant	enough	to	make	communications	an	impracticality,	as it	currently	is	for	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	if	you’re	wrong?”	Imbrahim	asked	bluntly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ultimately,	that	makes	little	difference,	Commander.	If	I’m	right,	we	buy	the Federation	time.	Perhaps	a	great	deal	of	it.	If	I’m	wrong,	it	really	doesn’t	matter, does	it?	One	way	or	another,	we’ll	be	sacrificed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	a	leap	of	logic	to	conclude	that	the	ship	that’s	been	following	us	is	a forerunner	for	an	invading	fleet,”	he	charged.	“It	may	simply	be	an	exploration vessel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	heavily	armed?”	Jhordel	snorted	dismissively.	“I	can’t	accept	that.	And why	such	an	aggressive	stance?	They	not	only	attacked	us,	but	have	pursued	us relentlessly.	Hardly	the	sort	of	actions	one	would	expect	of	a	lowly	exploration ship.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	couldn’t	argue	with	that;	indeed,	everything	they	knew	thus	far</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a>pointed	to	a	warship	of	some	description.	Moreover,	it	seemed	safe	to	assume	it was	a	scout;	for	had	a	fleet	been	close	at	hand,	he	suspected	they’d	have	seen	it by	now.	His	words	like	ice	in	a	colder	room,	fell	from	his	lips.	“The	zero-option,”	he	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	said	Jhordel,	and	left	it	at	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	recalled	his	days	in	the	Academy.	It	was	there	he’d	first	heard	of	the	zero-option.	At	that	time	he’d	never	considered	it	seriously;	it	had	been	something theoretical,	taught	to	students	in	much	the	same	way	time	travel	was.	Certainly he’d	never	imagined	he’d	ever	be	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">position	of	seeing	it	executed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	me,	Captain,”	he	said	carefully.	“What	if	the	zero-option	fails?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel’s	face	was	expressionless	as	she	said,	“It	won’t,	Commander.	It	never has.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	the	feeling	she	was	right,	but	he	wasn’t	sure	he	wanted	her	to	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wasn’t	sure	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a><b class="calibre3">39. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Identification,	please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jhordel,	Lhara	Annyselia,”	she	said,	with	a	precise	intonation.	“Captain, USF.	Serial	number	330-25671-01.	Commanding	FS	Confederation,	CFF-23.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Acknowledge.	Scanning.”	There	was	a	flash	of	light	in	the	com-link	cube, then	the	AI	said,	“Recognize	Jhordel,	Lhara	Annyselia.	Captain,	USF.	Serial number	330-25671-01.	Commanding	FS	Confederation,	CFF-23.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	hatch	slid	open	before	her.	Beyond,	shrouded	in	darkness,	a	small chamber.	She	licked	dry	lips	and	drew	a	breath,	then	pulled	herself	in.	A	soft blue	light	suffused	the	tiny	space,	cool	and	almost	comforting,	giving	the	bared flesh	of	her	arms	and	face	an	eerie	hue.	Behind	her	the	hatch	snapped	shut, sealing	her	off	from	the	rest	of	the	ship.	She	reached	up	and	slipped	a	thumb under	the	chain	that	held	a	slender	silver	key	about	her	neck.	She	turned	about	in the	chamber	and	faced	a	dark	panel	of	holokeys	and	a	com-link	that	was	set	in the	curved	wall.	In	the	center	of	this	was	a	narrow	slot,	just	large	enough	for	the business	end	of	the	key.	Jhordel	hesitated,	her	fingers	curled	tight	about	the warm	metal	of	the	key,	squeezing	it	until	its	sharp	edges	pressed	painfully	into her	palm.	Finally,	without	even	a	tremor	of	her	hand,	she	lifted	the	key	to	the	slot and	rammed	it	home.	It	slid	into	place	with	a	satisfying	click;	and	then	she grasped	the	protruding	end	and	turned	it	clockwise.	There	was	a	loud	beep	and the	panel	came	to	life,	the	com-link	cube	forming	before	her	eyes,	the	holokeys blooming	like	unfolding	flower	buds,	splashing	her	face	with	their	multicolored light.	The	com-link	beckoned;	she	stared	into	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	have	initiated	the	first	steps	in	activating	the	auto-destruct	mechanism	of the	FS	Confederation,	CFF-23,”	the	computer	announced.	“This	is	not	a simulation.	Repeat:	This	is	not	a	simulation.	Do	you	wish	to	proceed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	remained	silent	for	a	moment.	Too	long	for	the	AI’s	satisfaction.	“Do	you wish	to	proceed?”	it	asked	again;	and	she	thought	she	detected	an	undercurrent of	impatience	in	the	way	it	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	she	replied	sharply.	“Proceed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>“Completion	of	the	correct	sequence	of	procedures	will	result	in	the	disruption of	the	continuity	fields	within	the	graviton	collection	coils	of	the	Pearson	FTL. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Survival	of	this	event,	if	within	the	envelope	of	collapse,	is	zero	percent,”	the	AI warned.	“Do	you	understand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	understand,”	said	Jhordel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	com-link	cube	seemed	to	shift	and	reform,	revealing	a	new	image,	which Jhordel	recognized	from	her	Academy	training,	and	from	the	only	other	occasion she’d	done	this,	when	she’d	been	master	of	the	Grand	Banks.	She’d	never thought	she	would	ever	see	its	like	again;	but	this	time	would	be	the	last	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Procedure	number	one,”	the	AI	began.	As	the	machine	talked	her	through	the steps	necessary	for	activating	the	auto-destruct,	she	responded	to	each instruction	in	a	flat,	emotionless	voice,	reacting	like	an	automaton.	Red	lights turned	to	yellow	in	a	row	of	ten,	which	when	complete	flashed	once	and	then turned	green. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Auto-destruct	sequence	executed,”	the	AI	announced.	“Final	confirmation, please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Allegro,	seven,	seven,	six,”	Jhordel	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Affirmative.	Allegro,	seven,	seven,	six.	Auto-destruct	confirmed.	Countdown limit,	or	manual	activation?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Manual.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Confirmed.	Manual	activation.	From	specific	com-link?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain’s	quarters.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Confirmed.	Captain’s	quarters.	Programming	complete.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	closed	her	eyes	and	felt	the	sting	of	tears.	“Thank	you,”	she whispered.	“Good-bye.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good-bye,	Captain	Jhordel.	It	as	has	been	pleasure	serving	with	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a><b class="calibre3">40. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ship	seemed	lifeless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	encountered	no	one	as	he	stalked	the	corridors	of	officer	country.	But behind	each	door	he	knew	there	were	men	and	women	making	their	peace	with themselves,	in	whatever	way	they	cared	to.	Some	might	even	be	believers, praying	to	whatever	gods	or	spirits	to	which	they	might	subscribe.	He	envied them	that,	for	he	could	find	no	solace	in	prayer,	or	in	communion	with	deities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	made	for	a	feeling	of	loneliness,	far	deeper	than	any	he’d	yet	experienced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	paused	at	the	entrance	to	his	quarters,	debating	with	himself.	He	looked farther	down	the	corridor,	to	where	the	door	of	the	captain’s	cabin	stood	apart from	the	rest.	Jhordel	would	be	in	there,	he	was	certain;	because	he’d	already been	over	much	of	the	ship	and	not	seen	her.	Not	on	the	bridge,	nor	in	the engineering	section—the	two	mostly	likely	places	where	she	might	have	been found.	He	had	tried	the	observation	lounge,	but	it	had	been	filled	with	others awaiting	their	fate—and	somehow	he’d	the	feeling	that	Jhordel	would	be spending	these	last	few	moments	alone.	He	turned	away	from	his	cabin	door	and headed	up	country,	to	the	captain’s	quarters. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a><b class="calibre3">41. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	no	vocal	invitation	to	enter;	just	the	door	quietly	sliding	aside, revealing	a	darkened	room.	Imbrahim	stepped	forward,	the	light	of	the	corridor streaming	in	from	behind	like	rays	of	brilliant	sunlight,	silhouetting	him,	and casting	his	shadow	sharply	against	the	floor.	The	door	closed	with	a	hiss	of vented	air	and	a	dull	click.	He	glanced	back	at	it,	then	turned	to	face	the captain’s	inner	sanctum,	peering	intently	through	the	fog	of	darkness	as	his	eyes slowly	grew	accustomed	to	the	absence	of	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	going	to	stand	there	all	day,	Mister	Imbrahim?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	towards	the	source	of	the	voice	and	saw	the	outline	of	a	woman seated	behind	a	desk.	She	sat	facing	a	viewport,	staring	out	into	more lightlessness,	to	where	a	myriad	of	suns	shone	in	the	fathomless	depths,	like chips	of	phosphor	drifting	deep	in	a	nighttime	sea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	I’m	disturbing	you—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	laughter	cut	him	short.	It	was	sharp,	humorless	mirth,	which	spoke	of hopelessness	and	despair.	“Your	presence	on	this	ship	has	always	disturbed	me, Mister	Imbrahim,”	she	said.	“I’ve	wondered	from	the	beginning	why	Admiralty sent	you	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	could	tell	she	was	looking	at	him,	though	he	couldn’t	yet	make	out	the features	of	her	face.	“I	was	sent	to	find	out	what	happened	to	the	Niagara,”	he said;	but	even	he	didn’t	believe	that.	Not	now.	Not	any	longer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?”	she	asked	simply.	“We’ve	been	assigned	many	missions	before,	and never	an	intelligence	officer	on	any	of	them.	Why	now,	Mister	Imbrahim?	Why on	this	particular	mission?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shrugged,	though	he	wasn’t	sure	she	could	see	him	do	so.	“This	was different,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	yes.	I	suppose	it	was.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	could	see	she	was	holding	a	glass,	holding	it	at	arms	length,	studying	it, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>staring	at	the	stars	through	it.	She’d	been	drinking,	but	he	doubted	she	could	be drunk.	Not	unless	her	biobots	had	been	reprogrammed.	Spacers	were	always doing	that	on	shore	leave.	Pay	a	few	credits	to	the	right	person	and	it	could	be done	in	a	matter	of	seconds—if	you	were	willing	to	take	the	risk	of	some stranger	fiddling	around	with	something	that	could	as	easily	be	programmed	to kill	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sit	down,	Mister	Imbrahim.”	Jhordel	gestured	with	her	outstretched	arm, motioning	him	to	the	seat	across	from	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	sat,	stiffly,	feeling	uncomfortable,	and	regretting	that	he’d	come	here.	But there	was	no	turning	back.	He	wasn’t	sure	he	would	have	if	he	could	have.	As conscious	as	he	was	of	his	own	biting	loneliness,	he	was	even	more	aware	of hers.	Once	more	he	was	struck	by	the	realization	that	the	loneliest	person	on	this ship	was	the	captain.	Perhaps	ironically,	he	was	the	only	one	to	whom	she	could turn	in	a	time	like	this.	He	was	the	outsider,	the	one	who	didn’t	belong.	The	one to	whom	she	owed	nothing.	There	was	a	bottle	on	the	desk.	Jhordel	reached	for it,	barely	shifting	from	her	seat,	and	poured	something	into	a	glass.	She	set	the bottle	down	and	pushed	the	glass	across	to	him.	Imbrahim	stared	at	the	offering, making	no	movement	to	pick	it	up.	He	lifted	his	gaze	to	hers,	met	her	eyes, which	were	cast	in	shadow,	and	saw	the	black	heart	of	her	soul—saw	the	tempest of	her	emotions,	raging	within	her:	anger	battling	guilt	and	self-pity.	But	the	face was	granite.	Hard.	Impenetrable.	It	was	a	reflection	of	the	discipline	that	had held	her	captive	for	so	much	of	her	life,	and	even	now,	in	these	final	hours, would	not	easily	release	her	from	its	hold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Drink,”	she	said.	It	sounded	more	like	an	order	than	an	invitation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reluctantly	he	picked	up	the	glass,	sipped	tentatively,	grimacing	at	the	sharp taste	of	the	whiskey.	It	had	been	some	time	since	he’d	had	real	booze;	there	had never	seemed	much	point	when	it	was	impossible	to	get	drunk.	And	he’d	never been	the	sort	to	pay	some	hack	in	a	back	alley	shop	for	the	privilege.	But	he thought	if	he	could	have	found	such	a	person	now	he’d	have	gladly	paid	more than	ten	times	the	asking	price	just	to	get	a	little	buzz	on.	Just	to	numb	himself	to all	this…	All	this	what?	This	insanity? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	could	almost	laugh,	thinking	about	those	little	buggers	inside	him,	at	this very	moment	doing	their	damnedest	to	keep	him	alive.	Legions	of	the microscopic	biobots	floating	around	in	his	body,	providing	maintenance, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>repairing	internal	damage	incurred	by	radiation,	phase-shifts,	combat	maneuvers and	whatever	else	space	could	through	at	you.	An	army	defending	their	turf	and at	the	same	time	robbing	him	of	the	simple	pleasure	of	getting	falling-down drunk.	He	could	drink	bottles	and	bottles	of	Jhordel’s	damn	whiskey	and	the worst	that	would	happen	is	that	he’d	have	to	take	leak.	And	that	almost	made him	laugh	aloud	as	he	pictured	himself	stuck	in	a	washroom	pissing	away	when the	end	came.	There	was	almost	something	crudely	poetic	about	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“From	Earth,”	said	Jhordel,	nodding	to	the	bottle.	“I’ve	been	saving	it	for	a special	occasion.”	She	giggled,	the	sort	of	girlish	outburst	he’d	have	never expected	from	her;	and	for	a	moment	he	thought	he	caught	of	glimpse	of	what she’d	been	before	Obsidian.	Before	that	darkness	that	had	made	her	what	she was	today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	rather	hoping	it	would	have	been	for	an	occasion	a	little	less	sobering than	this,”	she	was	saying;	and	he	pulled	himself	from	his	moment	of	reverie	and forced	a	grin	and	said,	“There’s	still	hope,	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	pushed	her	chair	back	a	bit,	revealing	for	the	first	time	a	tactical	display. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	touch	of	a	finger	brightened	it,	its	multicolored	glow	washing	across	her	face and	splashing	onto	the	cellite	desk.	It	made	the	deep	amber	liquid	in	the	bottle glimmer	with	an	eerie	radiance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	no	hope,”	she	said	quietly.	Firmly.	She	stared	at	the	display. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	followed	her	gaze,	studying	the	tactical	and	quickly	spotting	the reason	for	her	pessimism.	On	the	edge	of	scanner	range	a	telltale	blip	blinked	on and	off,	indicating	the	presence	of	another	ship.	The	data	scrolling	next	to	it informed	him	it	was	approaching	them,	and	that	at	current	estimates	it	would reach	them	in	less	than	five	hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our	friends,”	he	said,	feeling	the	bottom	fall	out	of	his	world,	hope	dashed beyond	hope	of	resurrection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Impressive,	isn’t	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With	that	kind	of	technology	we	could	have	ended	the	war	against	the	Unity years	ago,”	he	observed,	forcing	himself	to	speak,	hearing	the	wooden	nature	of his	voice.	He	felt	frightened	and	angry	and	a	myriad	other	things.	One	part	of him	wanted	to	curl	up	and	cry.	Another	wanted	to	rage	against	the	injustice	of	it</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a>all,	wanted	to	pound	something	to	a	pulp.	Something.	Anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then,	impossibly,	there	was	this	crazy	notion	that	somehow,	someway, they	were	going	to	be	saved.	The	captain	would	think	of	some	extraordinary escape.	Or	a	fleet	of	Federation	cruisers	would	suddenly	drop	shift	around	them and	hammer	the	bastard	that	had	been	chasing	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	wouldn’t	die.	They	couldn’t	die. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	he	knew	that	was	just	desperation.	It	was	just	the	mind	refusing	to	believe the	inevitable.	It	was	the	man	clinging	to	a	cliff,	his	fingers	losing	their	grip,	and him	still	certain	that	someone	was	going	to	suddenly	appear	and	haul	him	to safety.	It	was	the	prisoner	in	front	of	the	firing	squad,	certain	there’d	be	a reprieve	even	as	men	lined	up	before	him	with	guns	aimed	at	his	heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	that	stuff	just	happened	in	holodramas.	It	wasn’t	real.	Real	life	was	cruel and	impersonal	and	didn’t	give	a	damn	whether	you	lived	or	died.	After	all,	in the	total	scheme	of	things	a	human	being	was	less	significant	than	a	grain	of sand	on	a	beach	a	million	million	light-years	long.	And	thinking	this, considering	this	with	a	phlegmatic	regard,	he	felt	all	the	anger	and	the	despair and	the	sense	of	desperation	drain	out	of	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	gives	one	pause	for	thought,	doesn’t?”	said	Jhordel.	She	shook	her	head ruefully	and	glanced	at	him,	sober-faced,	the	granite	of	her	features	shifting slightly	to	reveal	a	hint	emotion.	Mostly	it	was	regret.	“We’re	fighting	amongst ourselves,”	she	went	on.	“Perhaps	even	on	the	verge	of	destroying	what	we	so long	struggled	to	build.	And	now,	here,	on	our	doorstep,	is	a	force	that	may	test us	all.	We	may	soon	face	a	threat	of	such	magnitude	that	it’ll	make	the	conflict between	the	Unity	and	the	Federation	seem	like	a	petty	parochial	skirmish.”	She sipped	at	her	drink,	then	held	the	glass	pressed	against	her	cheek	as	she	stared out	the	viewport.	Imbrahim	waited	for	her	to	continue,	knowing	that	in	time	she would.	He	held	his	own	drink	in	his	lap,	hands	curled	about	the heavy	glass	tumbler,	savoring	the	calm	that	now	suffused	him,	mildly	amused	by how	removed	he	felt.	That	blip	on	the	edge	of	the	tactical	screen	was	a	death sentence;	yet	when	he	looked	at	it	now	he	felt	nothing	no	panic.	There	was	no sense	of	rage	anymore,	no	feeling	of	injustice.	Even	when	he	thought	of	dying, he	couldn’t	stir	himself	to	anything	more	than	mild	curiosity.	It	was	as	though	a part	of	him	had	known	all	along	that	it	would	come	to	this	and	had	resolved	that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>it	would	accept	it.	And	after	all,	what	else	could	he	do? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	almost	glad,”	Jhordel	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	blinked	and	looked	up,	abruptly	aware	his	thoughts	had	drifted.	“Glad	of what?”	he	heard	himself	ask. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	it’s	ending,”	she	said,	the	words	one	long	sigh.	“It	seems	as	though	I’ve spent	too	much	of	my	life	running.”	She	closed	her	eyes	and	leaned	her	head	into the	embrace	of	the	chair.	“There’s	almost	something	liberating	about	knowing it’ll	all	be	over	soon.	No	more	war	for	you	and	me,	Mister	Imbrahim.	No	more wondering	what	it’s	all	about.	No	more	wishing,	sometimes,	that	you	could	just have	a	normal	life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	knew	what	she	meant—understood	it	as	though	they	were	his	own thoughts	that	she	had	expressed.	But	he	was	surprised	to	hear	such	things	from her;	she	was	not	the	sort	he	could	ever	have	imagined	as	being	content	to	live	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘normal’	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	have	family,	Mister	Imbrahim?”	she	asked,	lolling	her	head	to	one side	to	look	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	parents,	and	a	brother	I’ve	not	seen	in	years.”	He	felt	a	fist	close	about his	heart	as	he	said	this.	He	hadn’t	even	thought	of	them	until	now.	Would	they ever	really	know	what	had	happened	to	him?	Perhaps	no	more	so	than	if	he’d died	on	any	of	his	other	missions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At	least	there’ll	be	someone	to	miss	you,”	Jhordel	said.	“At	least	there’ll	be someone	to	mourn.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	a	while,”	he	said.	“But	then	life	will	go	on,	as	it	has	for	the	many	who have	already	lost	loved	ones	in	this	war.	In	time,	things’ll	be	the	same.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled	sadly	and	said,	“It’s	never	the	same,	Mister	Imbrahim.	When	you lose	something…”	She	stopped,	seemed	lost	a	moment,	then	went	on:	“If	you lose	someone	dear	to	you,	it’s	as	though	some	part	of	you	has	been	ripped	out.	It leaves	a	hole	in	your	soul,	which	sometimes	can	fester	and	grow,	until	it consumes	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stared	at	her,	and	thought	she	wasn’t	talking	about	the	loss	of	her	parents, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>but	about	what	had	happened	to	her	on	Obsidian.	He	wanted	to	ask	her	about	it; but	now	seemed	even	less	appropriate	than	in	the	past.	And	what	would	be gained	by	knowing?	That	he	should	satisfy	his	curiosity	moments	before	he died?	It	didn’t	seem	worth	the	price	of	making	her	relive	something	that	had been	so	powerful	a	moment	in	her	life	that	it	had	changed	her	and	made	her	into what	she	was	today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	remember	in	the	Academy	they	told	us	we’d	get	used	to	death,”	he	said,	not quite	sure	why	he	was	saying	it.	“They	said	we’d	have	to,	or	we’d	go	insane.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	this	ship	must	be	full	of	the	truly	mad,	Commander,	for	I	doubt	there’s a	one	of	us	who	has	ever	become	used	to	death.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	accepting	of	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’d	never	dare	venture	into	space	if	you	weren’t	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	sat	silent	for	a	long	time	afterwards.	Imbrahim	watched	the	blip	on	the tactical	screen,	but	over	the	course	of	several	minutes	it	scarcely	seemed	to move.	Deceptive,	he	knew,	because	in	that	brief	period	of	time	the	ship	it represented	had	traveled	tens	of	thousands	of	kilometers	closer	to	the Confederation.	He	wondered	why	it	hadn’t	skip	jumped.	It	could	have	been	on them	in	seconds	if	it	had.	But	he	had	the	impression	the	enemy	was	moving cautiously,	approaching	at	a	conservative	pace—perhaps	anticipating	a	far	more aggressive	response	from	the	Confederation	than	their	first	encounter	with	one another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	not	fools,”	said	Jhordel,	voicing	what	Imbrahim	had	had	on	his mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	may	think	it’s	a	trap,”	he	said.	“We	might	not	draw	them	in	close enough.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded.	“My	thoughts	exactly.”	She	sat	up	straighter	in	her	chair	and turned	it	about,	bringing	herself	within	reach	of	the	com-link.	She	reached	out	a hand	and	activated	it,	then	asked	the	AI	to	summon	her	exec. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Skipper?”	Wethers	face	appeared	in	the	cube,	looking	as	attentive	as	ever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	last	job	for	you,	Mister	Wethers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a>“Sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	want	as	much	loose	material	as	possible	gathered	together.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	first	officer	frowned,	puzzled	by	the	request. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	need	to	make	sure	our	friends	out	there	come	close	enough	to	the	ship	to be	within	the	envelope	of	collapse,”	Jhordel	explained.	She	looked	grim-faced for	a	moment.	“When	you’ve	got	that	stuff	together	I	want	it	put	in	the	main hangerbay.	Have	the	bodies	removed	from	their	containers	and	placed	with	the loose	debris.	When	that’s	done,	blow	the	doors	and	open	the	bay	to	space.	I	want our	friends	out	there	to	think	we’re	dead.	They’ll	be	scanning	us	before	long. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let’s	give	them	something	to	make	them	believe	it’s	perfectly	safe	for	them	to come	in	for	a	closer	look.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enlightenment	dawned	on	Wethers’	face.	“I	think	I	understand,	sir,”	he	said, almost	smiling.	Almost,	but	not	quite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	face	of	the	exec	faded	from	the	cube,	but	not	from	Imbrahim’s	memory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	hesitant	look	of	acceptance	was	burned	into	his	mind;	he	thought	there	was something	almost	horrific	about	it.	They	were	obedient	to	the	end,	he	thought; and	then	realized	he	was	no	less	so.	He	was	sitting	here	drinking,	whiling	away the	last	hours	of	his	life	with	a	woman	he	scarcely	knew.	He	told	himself	there were	dozens	of	things	he	should	be	doing,	but	when	he	dwelt	on	the	matter	he could	think	of	none.	None	that	were	important.	None	that	mattered…now.	If Jhordel	had	chosen	to	send	off	a	hyperspace	capsule	to	the	Federation,	he	might have	sent	a	message.	But	the	captain	had	deemed	a	capsule	too	risky,	fearing their	pursuer	might	be	able	to	track	it	down	and	home	in	on	the	Federation	all that	much	faster.	So	they	would	all	vanish	in	a	few	hours.	Gone.	Forever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	a	trace	of	them	left	behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	found	himself	wondering	if	even	souls	could	exist	in	the	core	of	a singularity. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a><b class="calibre3">42. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	an	old	trick,”	said	Imbrahim	as	he	watched	the	drifting	debris	beyond	the viewport	of	Jhordel’s	cabin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To	us,”	said	the	captain.	“But	maybe	our	friend’s	out	there	never	saw	the same	movies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ll	know	the	truth	once	they	do	a	deep	scan.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	the	time	they	can	do	that,	they’ll	be	within	the	envelope	of	collapse.”	She looked	grimly	determined	as	she	peered	intently	at	the	tactical	display.	“All	we need	is	for	our	bait	to	work,	and	then	we’ll	have	hooked	our	fish.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	when	they	are	hooked?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jhordel	lifted	her	hand,	and	for	the	first	time	Imbrahim	saw	the	deadman switch	that	connected	her	to	the	com-link.	The	moment	she	released	it,	the destruct	mechanism	would	be	triggered.	For	some	reason	it	didn’t	surprise	him that	she	would	choose	to	do	it	manually;	it	was	her	ship	and	her	crew,	and	he thought	he	understood	her	well	enough,	now,	to	see	that	she	was	not	the	sort	to leave	such	a	final	act	to	a	machine.	Besides,	it	gave	her	an	out—a	means	of retreating	from	commitment.	All	she	had	to	do	was	hold	onto	that	switch	and instruct	the	AI	to	halt	the	auto-destruct.	For	just	a	moment	Imbrahim	felt	a	spark of	hope	flicker	within	him.	Perhaps,	he	thought—but	it	went	no	further	than	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	again	at	Jhordel,	at	the	hand	that	held	the	switch.	There	was something	unnerving	about	being	so	close	to	the	mechanism	that	would	bring about	their	destruction.	Like	sitting	on	a	live	grenade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	manually?”	he	heard	himself	ask	in	a	faint,	faraway	voice.	“You	could have	had	the	AI	use	a	proximity	trigger.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	my	choice,”	she	said,	confirming	his	earlier	suspicions.	“I’m	the	one who	got	us	here.	I’m	the	one	responsible.	I’m	the	one	who’ll	end	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	make	it	sound	as	though	you’re	at	fault.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am,	Commander.”	She	regarded	him	forthrightly.	“As	captain	of	this	ship	I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>assume	all	blame.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	what	of	fate?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed.	“Fate	is	for	the	faithful,	Mister	Imbrahim;	and	I’m	not	one	of them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a><b class="calibre3">43. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wished	he	could	have	seen	the	enemy,	could	have	seen	their	ship,	seen their	faces,	so	that	he	would	have	known	them.	Would	have	known	what	they were,	and	perhaps	in	so	knowing	would	have	better	understood	them.	But	they were	just	a	blip	on	the	screen,	fast	approaching,	soon	to	merge	with	the	solitary red	marker	that	was	the	Confederation.	They	were	faceless.	Unknown.	They might	even	have	been	machines,	though	his	instincts	told	him	otherwise.	He could	only	imagine,	and	the	imagining	was	limited	by	the	narrow	breadth	of	his experiences.	In	the	long	run	it	didn’t	matter.	In	that	remote	corner	of	space	all pasts	were	forgotten,	all	lives	erased.	It	was	a	place	of	endings,	and	perhaps	a place	of	beginnings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbrahim	watched	the	tactical	screen	with	a	pounding	heart	and	a	mouth	as dry	as	dust.	Only	in	these	last	few	seconds,	as	the	two	markers	indicating	the ships	joined	as	one	did	he	realize	he	was	truly	afraid	to	die.	But	by	then	it	was too	late.	Jhordel	turned	from	the	tactical	display	and	faced	him,	the	hand	with	the deadman	switch	held	before	her.	She	smiled,	and	whispered	something	he	did not	hear.	Her	secret,	he	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Obsidian. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	the	world	ended. </p>
