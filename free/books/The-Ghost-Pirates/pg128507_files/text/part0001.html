    A moment later, I saw the man's head appear over the top. He had the
tail-block slung round his neck, and the end of the gantline over his
shoulder.</p>

<p id="id00320" class="calibre1">Very soon we had the gantline rigged, and Tom down on deck. Then we took
him into the fo'cas'le and put him in his bunk. The Second Mate had sent
for some brandy, and now he started to dose him well with it. At the
same time a couple of the men chafed his hands and feet. In a little, he
began to show signs of coming round. Presently, after a sudden fit of
coughing, he opened his eyes, with a surprised, bewildered stare. Then
he caught at the edge of his bunk-board, and sat up, giddily. One of the
men steadied him, while the Second Mate stood back, and eyed him,
critically. The boy rocked as he sat, and put up his hand to his head.</p>

<p id="id00321" class="calibre1">"Here," said the Second Mate, "take another drink."</p>

<p id="id00322" class="calibre1">Tom caught his breath and choked a little; then he spoke.</p>

<p id="id00323" class="calibre1">"By gum!" he said, "my head does ache."</p>

<p id="id00324" class="calibre1">He put up his hand, again, and felt at the lump on his forehead. Then he
bent forward and stared round at the men grouped about his bunk.</p>

<p id="id00325" class="calibre1">"What's up?" he inquired, in a confused sort of way, and seeming as if
he could not see us clearly.</p>

<p id="id00326" class="calibre1">"What's up?" he asked again.</p>

<p id="id00327" class="calibre1">"That's just what I want to know!" said the Second Mate, speaking for
the first time with some sternness.</p>

<p id="id00328" class="calibre1">"I ain't been snoozin' while there's been a job on?" Tom inquired,
anxiously.</p>

<p id="id00329" class="calibre1">He looked round at the men appealingly.</p>

<p id="id00330" class="calibre1">"It's knocked 'im dotty, strikes me," said one of the men, audibly.</p>

<p id="id00331" class="calibre1">"No," I said, answering Tom's question, "you've had—"</p>

<p id="id00332" class="calibre1">"Shut that, Jessop!" said the Second Mate, quickly, interrupting me. "I
want to hear what the boy's got to say for himself."</p>

<p id="id00333" class="calibre1">He turned again to Tom.</p>

<p id="id00334" class="calibre1">"You were up at the fore royal," he prompted.</p>

<p id="id00335" class="calibre1">"I carn't say I was, Sir," said Tom, doubtfully. I could see that he had
not gripped the Second Mate's meaning.</p>

<p id="id00336" class="calibre1">"But you were!" said the Second, with some impatience. "It was blowing
adrift, and I sent you up to shove a gasket round it."</p>

<p id="id00337" class="calibre1">"Blowin' adrift, Sir?" said Tom, dully.</p>

<p id="id00338" class="calibre1">"Yes! blowing adrift. Don't I speak plainly?"</p>

<p id="id00339" class="calibre1">The dullness went from Tom's face, suddenly.</p>

<p id="id00340" class="calibre1">"So it was, Sir," he said, his memory returning. "The bloomin' sail got
chock full of wind. It caught me bang in the face."</p>

<p id="id00341" class="calibre1">He paused a moment.</p>

<p id="id00342" class="calibre1">"I believe—" he began, and then stopped once more.</p>

<p id="id00343" class="calibre1">"Go on!" said the Second Mate. "Spit it out!"</p>

<p id="id00344" class="calibre1">"I don't know, Sir," Tom said. "I don't understand—"</p>

<p id="id00345" class="calibre1">He hesitated again.</p>

<p id="id00346" class="calibre1">"That's all I can remember," he muttered, and put his hand up to the
bruise on his forehead, as though trying to remember something.</p>

<p id="id00347" class="calibre1">In the momentary silence that succeeded, I caught the voice of Stubbins.</p>

<p id="id00348" class="calibre1">"There hain't hardly no wind," he was saying, in a puzzled tone.</p>

<p id="id00349" class="calibre1">There was a low murmur of assent from the surrounding men.</p>

<p id="id00350" class="calibre1">The Second Mate said nothing, and I glanced at him, curiously. Was he
beginning to see, I wondered, how useless it was to try to find any
sensible explanation of the affair? Had he begun at last to couple it
with that peculiar business of the man up the main? I am inclined <i class="calibre7">now</i>
to think that this was so; for, after staring a few moments at Tom, in a
doubtful sort of way, he went out of the fo'cas'le, saying that he would
inquire further into the matter in the morning. Yet, when the morning
came, he did no such thing. As for his reporting the affair to the
Skipper, I much doubt it. Even did he, it must have been in a very
casual way; for we heard nothing more about it; though, of course, we
talked it over pretty thoroughly among ourselves.</p>

<p id="id00351" class="calibre1">With regard to the Second Mate, even now I am rather puzzled by his
attitude to us aloft. Sometimes I have thought that he must have
suspected us of trying to play off some trick on him—perhaps, at the
time, he still half suspected one of us of being in some way connected
with the other business. Or, again, he may have been trying to fight
against the conviction that was being forced upon him, that there was
really something impossible and beastly about the old packet. Of course,
these are only suppositions.</p>

<p id="id00352" class="calibre1">And then, close upon this, there were further developments.</p>

<div class="calibre4"></div><h2 id="id00353" class="calibre5">V</h2>

<p id="id00354" class="calibre2"><i class="calibre7">The End of Williams</i></p>

<p id="id00355" class="calibre1">As I have said, there was a lot of talk, among the crowd of us forrard,
about Tom's strange accident. None of the men knew that Williams and I
had seen it <i class="calibre7">happen</i>. Stubbins gave it as his opinion that Tom had been
sleepy, and missed the foot-rope. Tom, of course, would not have this by
any means. Yet, he had no one to appeal to; for, at that time, he was
just as ignorant as the rest, that we had seen the sail flap up over the
yard.</p>

<p id="id00356" class="calibre1">Stubbins insisted that it stood to reason it couldn't be the wind. There
wasn't any, he said; and the rest of the men agreed with him.</p>

<p id="id00357" class="calibre1">"Well," I said, "I don't know about all that. I'm a bit inclined to
think Tom's yarn is the truth."</p>

<p id="id00358" class="calibre1">"How do you make that hout?" Stubbins asked, unbelievingly. "There haint
nothin' like enough wind."</p>

<p id="id00359" class="calibre1">"What about the place on his forehead?" I inquired, in turn. "How are
you going to explain that?"</p>

<p id="id00360" class="calibre1">"I 'spect he knocked himself there when he slipped," he answered.</p>

<p id="id00361" class="calibre1">"Likely 'nuffli," agreed old Jaskett, who was sitting smoking on a chest
near by.</p>

<p id="id00362" class="calibre1">"Well, you're both a damn long way out of it!" Tom chipped in, pretty
warm. "I wasn't asleep; an' the sail did bloomin' well hit me."</p>

<p id="id00363" class="calibre1">"Don't you be impertinent, young feller," said Jaskett.</p>

<p id="id00364" class="calibre1">I joined in again.</p>

<p id="id00365" class="calibre1">"There's another thing, Stubbins," I said. "The gasket Tom was hanging
by, was on the after side of the yard. That looks as if the sail might
have flapped it over? If there were wind enough to do the one, it seems
to me that it might have done the other."</p>

<p id="id00366" class="calibre1">"Do you mean that it was hunder ther yard, or hover ther top?" he asked.</p>

<p id="id00367" class="calibre1">"Over the top, of course. What's more, the foot of the sail was hanging
over the after part of the yard, in a bight."</p>

<p id="id00368" class="calibre1">Stubbins was plainly surprised at that, and before he was ready with his
next objection, Plummer spoke.</p>

<p id="id00369" class="calibre1">"'oo saw it?" he asked.</p>

<p id="id00370" class="calibre1">"I saw it!" I said, a bit sharply. "So did Williams; so—for that
matter—did the Second Mate."</p>

<p id="id00371" class="calibre1">Plummer relapsed into silence; and smoked; and Stubbins broke out
afresh.</p>

<p id="id00372" class="calibre1">"I reckon Tom must have had a hold of the foot and the gasket, and
pulled 'em hover the yard when he tumbled."</p>

<p id="id00373" class="calibre1">"No!" interrupted Tom. "The gasket was under the sail. I couldn't even
see it. An' I hadn't time to get hold of the foot of the sail, before it
up and caught me smack in the face."</p>

<p id="id00374" class="calibre1">"'ow did yer get 'old er ther gasket, when yer fell, then?" asked
Plummer.</p>

<p id="id00375" class="calibre1">"He didn't get hold of it," I answered for Tom. "It had taken a turn
round his wrist, and that's how we found him hanging."</p>

<p id="id00376" class="calibre1">"Do you mean to say as 'e 'adn't got 'old of ther garsket?," Quoin
inquired, pausing in the lighting of his pipe.</p>

<p id="id00377" class="calibre1">"Of course, I do," I said. "A chap doesn't go hanging on to a rope when
he's jolly well been knocked senseless."</p>

<p id="id00378" class="calibre1">"Ye're richt," assented Jock. "Ye're quite richt there, Jessop."</p>

<p id="id00379" class="calibre1">Quoin concluded the lighting of his pipe.</p>

<p id="id00380" class="calibre1">"I dunno," he said.</p>

<p id="id00381" class="calibre1">I went on, without noticing him.</p>

<p id="id00382" class="calibre1">"Anyway, when Williams and I found him, he was hanging by the gasket,
and it had a couple of turns round his wrist. And besides that, as I
said before, the foot of the sail was hanging over the after side of the
yard, and Tom's weight on the gasket was holding it there."</p>

<p id="id00383" class="calibre1">"It's damned queer," said Stubbins, in a puzzled voice. "There don't
seem to be no way of gettin' a proper hexplanation to it."</p>

<p id="id00384" class="calibre1">I glanced at Williams, to suggest that I should tell all that we had
seen; but he shook his head, and, after a moment's thought, it seemed to
me that there was nothing to be gained by so doing. We had no very clear
idea of the thing that had happened, and our half facts and guesses
would only have tended to make the matter appear more grotesque and
unlikely. The only thing to be done was to wait and watch. If we could
only get hold of something tangible, then we might hope to tell all that
we knew, without being made into laughing-stocks.</p>

<p id="id00385" class="calibre1">I came out from my think, abruptly.</p>

<p id="id00386" class="calibre1">Stubbins was speaking again. He was arguing the matter with one of the
other men.</p>

<p id="id00387" class="calibre1">"You see, with there bein' no wind, scarcely, ther thing's himpossible,
an' yet—"</p>

<p id="id00388" class="calibre1">The other man interrupted with some remark I did not catch.</p>

<p id="id00389" class="calibre1">"No," I heard Stubbins say. "I'm hout of my reckonin'. I don't savvy it
one bit. It's too much like a damned fairy tale."</p>

<p id="id00390" class="calibre1">"Look at his wrist!" I said.</p>

<p id="id00391" class="calibre1">Tom held out his right hand and arm for inspection. It was considerably
swollen where the rope had been round it.</p>

<p id="id00392" class="calibre1">"Yes," admitted Stubbins. "That's right enough; but it don't tell you
nothin'."</p>

<p id="id00393" class="calibre1">I made no reply. As Stubbins said, it told you "nothin'." And there I
let it drop. Yet, I have told you this, as showing how the matter was
regarded in the fo'cas'le. Still, it did not occupy our minds very long;
for, as I have said, there were further developments.</p>

<p id="id00394" class="calibre1">The three following nights passed quietly; and then, on the fourth, all
those curious signs and hints culminated suddenly in something
extraordinarily grim. Yet, everything had been so subtle and intangible,
and, indeed, so was the affair itself, that only those who had actually
come in touch with the invading fear, seemed really capable of
comprehending the terror of the thing. The men, for the most part, began
to say the ship was unlucky, and, of course, as usual! there was some
talk of there being a Jonah in the ship. Still, I cannot say that none
of the men realised there was anything horrible and frightening in it
all; for I am sure that some did, a little; and I think Stubbins was
certainly one of them; though I feel certain that he did not, at that
time, you know, grasp a quarter of the real significance that underlay
the several queer matters that had disturbed our nights. He seemed to
fail, somehow, to grasp the element of personal danger that, to me, was
already plain. He lacked sufficient imagination, I suppose, to piece the
things together—to trace the natural sequence of the events, and their
development. Yet I must not forget, of course, that he had no knowledge
of those two first incidents. If he had, perhaps he might have stood
where I did. As it was, he had not seemed to reach out at all, you know,
not even in the matter of Tom and the fore royal. Now, however, after
the thing I am about to tell you, he seemed to see a little way into the
darkness, and realise possibilities.</p>

<p id="id00395" class="calibre1">I remember the fourth night, well. It was a clear, star-lit, moonless
sort of night: at least, I think there was no moon; or, at any rate, the
moon could have been little more than a thin crescent, for it was near
the dark time.</p>

<p id="id00396" class="calibre1">The wind had breezed up a bit; but still remained steady. We were
slipping along at about six or seven knots an hour. It was our middle
watch on deck, and the ship was full of the blow and hum of the wind
aloft. Williams and I were the only ones about the maindeck. He was
leaning over the weather pin-rail, smoking; while I was pacing up and
down, between him and the fore hatch. Stubbins was on the look-out.</p>

<p id="id00397" class="calibre1">Two bells had gone some minutes, and I was wishing to goodness that it
was eight, and time to turn-in. Suddenly, overhead, there sounded a
sharp crack, like the report of a rifle shot. It was followed instantly
by the rattle and crash of sailcloth thrashing in the wind.</p>

<p id="id00398" class="calibre1">Williams jumped away from the rail, and ran aft a few steps. I followed
him, and, together, we stared upwards to see what had gone.
Indistinctly, I made out that the weather sheet of the fore t'gallant
had carried away, and the clew of the sail was whirling and banging
about in the air, and, every few moments, hitting the steel yard a blow,
like the thump of a great sledge hammer.</p>

<p id="id00399" class="calibre1">"It's the shackle, or one of the links that's gone, I think," I shouted
to Williams, above the noise of the sail. "That's the spectacle that's
hitting the yard."</p>

<p id="id00400" class="calibre1">"Yus!" he shouted back, and went to get hold of the clewline. I ran to
give him a hand. At the same moment, I caught the Second Mate's voice
away aft, shouting. Then came the noise of running feet, and the rest of
the watch, and the Second Mate, were with us almost at the same moment.
In a few minutes we had the yard lowered and the sail clewed up. Then
Williams and I went aloft to see where the sheet had gone. It was much
as I had supposed; the spectacle was all right, but the pin had gone out
of the shackle, and the shackle itself was jammed into the sheavehole in
the yard arm.</p>

<p id="id00401" class="calibre1">Williams sent me down for another pin, while he unbent the clewline, and
overhauled it down to the sheet. When I returned with the fresh pin, I
screwed it into the shackle, clipped on the clewline, and sung out to
the men to take a pull on the rope. This they did, and at the second
heave the shackle came away. When it was high enough, I went up on to
the t'gallant yard, and held the chain, while Williams shackled it into
the spectacle. Then he bent on the clewline afresh, and sung out to the
Second Mate that we were ready to hoist away.</p>

<p id="id00402" class="calibre1">"Yer'd better go down an' give 'em a 'aul," he said. "I'll sty an' light
up ther syle."</p>

<p id="id00403" class="calibre1">"Right ho, Williams," I said, getting into the rigging. "Don't let the
ship's bogy run away with you."</p>

<p id="id00404" class="calibre1">This remark I made in a moment of light-heartedness, such as will come
to anyone aloft, at times. I was exhilarated for the time being, and
quite free from the sense of fear that had been with me so much of late.
I suppose this was due to the freshness of the wind.</p>

<p id="id00405" class="calibre1">"There's more'n one!" he said, in that curiously short way of his.</p>

<p id="id00406" class="calibre1">"What?" I asked.</p>

<p id="id00407" class="calibre1">He repeated his remark.</p>

<p id="id00408" class="calibre1">I was suddenly serious. The <i class="calibre7">reality</i> of all the impossible details of
the past weeks came back to me, vivid, and beastly.</p>

<p id="id00409" class="calibre1">"What do you mean, Williams?" I asked him.</p>

<p id="id00410" class="calibre1">But he had shut up, and would say nothing.</p>

<p id="id00411" class="calibre1">"What do you know—how much do you know?" I went on, quickly. "Why did
you never tell me that you—"</p>

<p id="id00412" class="calibre1">The Second Mate's voice interrupted me, abruptly:</p>

<p id="id00413" class="calibre1">"Now then, up there! Are you going to keep us waiting all night? One of
you come down and give us a pull with the ha'lyards. The other stay up
and light up the gear."</p>

<p id="id00414" class="calibre1">"i, i, Sir," I shouted back.</p>

<p id="id00415" class="calibre1">Then I turned to Williams, hurriedly.</p>

<p id="id00416" class="calibre1">"Look here, Williams," I said. "If you think there is <i class="calibre7">really</i> a danger
in your being alone up here—" I hesitated for words to express what I
meant. Then I went on. "Well, I'll jolly well stay up with you."</p>

<p id="id00417" class="calibre1">The Second Mate's voice came again.</p>

<p id="id00418" class="calibre1">"Come on now, one of you! Make a move! What the hell are you doing?"</p>

<p id="id00419" class="calibre1">"Coming, Sir!" I sung out.</p>

<p id="id00420" class="calibre1">"Shall I stay?" I asked definitely.</p>

<p id="id00421" class="calibre1">"Garn!" he said. "Don't yer fret yerself. I'll tike er bloomin' piy-diy
out of 'er. Blarst 'em. I ain't funky of 'em."</p>

<p id="id00422" class="calibre1">I went. That was the last word Williams spoke to anyone living.</p>

<p id="id00423" class="calibre1">I reached the decks, and tailed on to the haulyards.</p>

<p id="id00424" class="calibre1">We had nearly mast-headed the yard, and the Second Mate was looking up
at the dark outline of the sail, ready to sing out "Belay"; when, all at
once, there came a queer sort of muffled shout from Williams.</p>

<p id="id00425" class="calibre1">"Vast hauling, you men," shouted the Second Mate.</p>

<p id="id00426" class="calibre1">We stood silent, and listened.</p>

<p id="id00427" class="calibre1">"What's that, Williams?" he sung out. "Are you all clear?"</p>

<p id="id00428" class="calibre1">For nearly half a minute we stood, listening; but there came no reply.
Some of the men said afterwards that they had noticed a curious rattling
and vibrating noise aloft that sounded faintly above the hum and swirl
of the wind. Like the sound of loose ropes being shaken and slatted
together, you know. Whether this noise was really heard, or whether it
was something that had no existence outside of their imaginations, I
cannot say. I heard nothing of it; but then I was at the tail end of the
rope, and furthest from the fore rigging; while those who heard it were
on the fore part of the haulyards, and close up to the shrouds.</p>

<p id="id00429" class="calibre1">The Second Mate put his hands to his mouth.</p>

<p id="id00430" class="calibre1">"Are you all clear there?" he shouted again.</p>

<p id="id00431" class="calibre1">The answer came, unintelligible and unexpected. It ran like this:</p>

<p id="id00432" class="calibre1">"Blarst yer … I've styed … Did yer think … drive … bl—y
piy-diy." And then there was a sudden silence.</p>

<p id="id00433" class="calibre1">I stared up at the dim sail, astonished.</p>

<p id="id00434" class="calibre1">"He's dotty!" said Stubbins, who had been told to come off the look-out
and give us a pull.</p>

<p id="id00435" class="calibre1">"'e's as mad as a bloomin' 'atter," said Quoin, who was standing
foreside of me. "'e's been queer all along."</p>

<p id="id00436" class="calibre1">"Silence there!" shouted the Second Mate. Then:</p>

<p id="id00437" class="calibre1">"Williams!"</p>

<p id="id00438" class="calibre1">No answer.</p>

<p id="id00439" class="calibre1">"Williams!" more loudly.</p>

<p id="id00440" class="calibre1">Still no answer.</p>

<p id="id00441" class="calibre1">Then:</p>

<p id="id00442" class="calibre1">"Damn you, you jumped-up cockney crocodile! Can't you hear? Are you
blooming-well deaf?"</p>

<p id="id00443" class="calibre1">There was no answer, and the Second Mate turned to me.</p>

<p id="id00444" class="calibre1">"Jump aloft, smartly now, Jessop, and see what's wrong!"</p>

<p id="id00445" class="calibre1">"i, i, Sir," I said and made a run for the rigging. I felt a bit queer.
Had Williams gone mad? He certainly always had been a bit funny. Or—and
the thought came with a jump—had he seen—I did not finish. Suddenly,
up aloft, there sounded a frightful scream. I stopped, with my hand on
the sheerpole. The next instant, something fell out of the darkness—a
heavy body, that struck the deck near the waiting men, with a tremendous
crash and a loud, ringing, wheezy sound that sickened me. Several of the
men shouted out loud in their fright, and let go of the haulyards; but
luckily the stopper held it, and the yard did not come down. Then, for
the space of several seconds, there was a dead silence among the crowd;
and it seemed to me that the wind had in it a strange moaning note.</p>

<p id="id00446" class="calibre1">The Second Mate was the first to speak. His voice came so abruptly that
it startled me.</p>

<p id="id00447" class="calibre1">"Get a light, one of you, quick now!"</p>

<p id="id00448" class="calibre1">There was a moment's hesitation.</p>

<p id="id00449" class="calibre1">"Fetch one of the binnacle lamps, you, Tammy."</p>

<p id="id00450" class="calibre1">"i, i, Sir," the youngster said, in a quavering voice, and ran aft.</p>

<p id="id00451" class="calibre1">In less than a minute I saw the light coming towards us along the deck.<br class="calibre10"/>

The boy was running. He reached us, and handed the lamp to the Second<br class="calibre10"/>

Mate, who took it and went towards the dark, huddled heap on the deck.<br class="calibre10"/>

He held the light out before him, and peered at the thing.<br class="calibre10"/>
</p>

<p id="id00452" class="calibre1">"My God!" he said. "It's Williams!"</p>

<p id="id00453" class="calibre1">He stooped lower with the light, and I saw details. It was Williams
right enough. The Second Mate told a couple of the men to lift him and
straighten him out on the hatch. Then he went aft to call the Skipper.
He returned in a couple of minutes with an old ensign which he spread
over the poor beggar. Almost directly, the Captain came hurrying forward
along the decks. He pulled back one end of the ensign, and looked; then
he put it back quietly, and the Second Mate explained all that we knew,
in a few words.</p>

<p id="id00454" class="calibre1">"Would you leave him where he is, Sir?" he asked, after he had told
everything.</p>

<p id="id00455" class="calibre1">"The night's fine," said the Captain. "You may as well leave the poor
devil there."</p>

<p id="id00456" class="calibre1">He turned, and went aft, slowly. The man who was holding the light,
swept it round so that it showed the place where Williams had struck the
deck.</p>

<p id="id00457" class="calibre1">The Second Mate spoke abruptly.</p>

<p id="id00458" class="calibre1">"Get a broom and a couple of buckets, some of you."</p>

<p id="id00459" class="calibre1">He turned sharply, and ordered Tammy on to the poop.</p>

<p id="id00460" class="calibre1">As soon as he had seen the yard mast-headed, and the ropes cleared up,
he followed Tammy. He knew well enough that it would not do for the
youngster to let his mind dwell too much on the poor chap on the hatch,
and I found out, a little later, that he gave the boy something to
occupy his thoughts.</p>

<p id="id00461" class="calibre1">After they had gone aft, we went into the fo'cas'le. Every one was moody
and frightened. For a little while, we sat about in our bunks and on the
chests, and no one said a word. The watch below were all asleep, and not
one of them knew what had happened.</p>

<p id="id00462" class="calibre1">All at once, Plummer, whose wheel it was, stepped over the starboard
washboard, into the fo'cas'le.</p>

<p id="id00463" class="calibre1">"What's up, anyway?" he asked. "Is Williams much 'urt?"</p>

<p id="id00464" class="calibre1">"Sh!" I said. "You'll wake the others. Who's taken your wheel?"</p>

<p id="id00465" class="calibre1">"Tammy—ther Second sent 'im. 'e said I could go forrard an' 'ave er
smoke. 'e said Williams 'ad 'ad er fall."</p>

<p id="id00466" class="calibre1">He broke off, and looked across the fo'cas'le.</p>

<p id="id00467" class="calibre1">"Where is 'e?" he inquired, in a puzzled voice.</p>

<p id="id00468" class="calibre1">I glanced at the others; but no one seemed inclined to start yarning
about it.</p>

<p id="id00469" class="calibre1">"He fell from the t'gallant rigging!" I said.</p>

<p id="id00470" class="calibre1">"Where is 'e?" he repeated.</p>

<p id="id00471" class="calibre1">"Smashed up," I said. "He's lying on the hatch."</p>

<p id="id00472" class="calibre1">"Dead?" he asked.</p>

<p id="id00473" class="calibre1">I nodded.</p>

<p id="id00474" class="calibre1">"I guessed 'twere somethin' pretty bad, when I saw the Old Man come
forrard. 'ow did it 'appen?"</p>

<p id="id00475" class="calibre1">He looked round at the lot of us sitting there silent and smoking.</p>

<p id="id00476" class="calibre1">"No one knows," I said, and glanced at Stubbins. I caught him eyeing me,
doubtfully.</p>

<p id="id00477" class="calibre1">After a moment's silence, Plummer spoke again.</p>

<p id="id00478" class="calibre1">"I 'eard 'im screech, when I was at ther wheel. 'e must 'ave got 'urt up
aloft."</p>

<p id="id00479" class="calibre1">Stubbins struck a match and proceeded to relight his pipe.</p>

<p id="id00480" class="calibre1">"How d'yer mean?" he asked, speaking for the first time.</p>

<p id="id00481" class="calibre1">"'ow do I mean? Well, I can't say. Maybe 'e jammed 'is fingers between
ther parrel an' ther mast."</p>

<p id="id00482" class="calibre1">"What about 'is swearin' at ther Second Mate? Was that 'cause 'e'd
jammed 'is fingers?" put in Quoin.</p>

<p id="id00483" class="calibre1">"I never 'eard about that," said Plummer. "'oo 'eard 'im?</p>

<p id="id00484" class="calibre1">"I should think heverybody in ther bloomin' ship heard him," Stubbins
answered. "All ther same, I hain't sure he <i class="calibre7">was</i> swearin' at ther Second
Mate. I thought at first he'd gone dotty an' was cussin' him; but
somehow it don't seem likely, now I come to think. It don't stand to
reason he should go to cuss ther man. There was nothin' to go cussin'
about. What's more, he didn't seem ter be talkin' down to us on deck—
what I could make hout. 'sides, what would he want ter go talkin' to
ther Second about his pay-day?"</p>

<p id="id00485" class="calibre1">He looked across to where I was sitting. Jock, who was smoking, quietly,
on the chest next to me, took his pipe slowly out from between his
teeth.</p>

<p id="id00486" class="calibre1">"Ye're no far oot, Stubbins, I'm thinkin'. Ye're no far oot," he said,
nodding his head.</p>

<p id="id00487" class="calibre1">Stubbins still continued to gaze at me.</p>

<p id="id00488" class="calibre1">"What's your idee?" he said, abruptly.</p>

<p id="id00489" class="calibre1">It may have been my fancy, but it seemed to me that there was something
deeper than the mere sense the question conveyed.</p>

<p id="id00490" class="calibre1">I glanced at him. I couldn't have said, myself, just what my idea was.</p>

<p id="id00491" class="calibre1">"I don't know!" I answered, a little adrift. "He didn't strike me as
cursing at the Second Mate. That is, I should say, after the first
minute."</p>

<p id="id00492" class="calibre1">"Just what I say," he replied. "Another thing—don't it strike you as
bein' bloomin' queer about Tom nearly comin' down by ther run, an' then
<i class="calibre7">this?</i>"</p>

<p id="id00493" class="calibre1">I nodded.</p>

<p id="id00494" class="calibre1">"It would have been all hup with Tom, if it hadn't been for ther
gasket."</p>

<p id="id00495" class="calibre1">He paused. After a moment, he went on again.</p>

<p id="id00496" class="calibre1">"That was honly three or four nights ago!"</p>

<p id="id00497" class="calibre1">"Well," said Plummer. "What are yer drivin' at?"</p>

<p id="id00498" class="calibre1">"Nothin'," answered Stubbins. "Honly it's damned queer. Looks as though
ther ship might be unlucky, after all."</p>

<p id="id00499" class="calibre1">"Well," agreed Plummer. "Things 'as been a bit funny lately; and then
there's what's 'appened ter-night. I shall 'ang on pretty tight ther
next time I go aloft."</p>

<p id="id00500" class="calibre1">Old Jaskett took his pipe from his mouth, and sighed.</p>

<p id="id00501" class="calibre1">"Things is going wrong 'most every night," he said, almost pathetically.
"It's as diff'rent as chalk 'n' cheese ter what it were w'en we started
this 'ere trip. I thought it were all 'ellish rot about 'er bein'
'aunted; but it's not, seem'ly."</p>

<p id="id00502" class="calibre1">He stopped and expectorated.</p>

<p id="id00503" class="calibre1">"She hain't haunted," said Stubbins. "Leastways, not like you mean—"</p>

<p id="id00504" class="calibre1">He paused, as though trying to grasp some elusive thought.</p>

<p id="id00505" class="calibre1">"Eh?" said Jaskett, in the interval.</p>

<p id="id00506" class="calibre1">Stubbins continued, without noticing the query. He appeared to be
answering some half-formed thought in his own brain, rather than
Jaskett:</p>

<p id="id00507" class="calibre1">"Things is queer—an' it's been a bad job tonight. I don't savvy one bit
what Williams was sayin' of hup aloft. I've thought sometimes he'd
somethin' on 'is mind—"</p>

<p id="id00508" class="calibre1">Then, after a pause of about half a minute, he said this:</p>

<p id="id00509" class="calibre1">"<i class="calibre7">Who</i> was he sayin' that to?"</p>

<p id="id00510" class="calibre1">"Eh?" said Jaskett, again, with a puzzled expression.</p>

<p id="id00511" class="calibre1">"I was thinkin'," said Stubbins, knocking out his pipe on the edge of
the chest. "P'raps you're right, hafter all."</p>

<div class="calibre4"></div><h2 id="id00512" class="calibre5">VI</h2>

<p id="id00513" class="calibre2"><i class="calibre7">Another Man to the Wheel</i></p>

<p id="id00514" class="calibre1">The conversation had slacked off. We were all moody and shaken, and I
know I, for one, was thinking some rather troublesome thoughts.</p>

<p id="id00515" class="calibre1">Suddenly, I heard the sound of the Second's whistle. Then his voice came
along the deck:</p>

<p id="id00516" class="calibre1">"Another man to the wheel!"</p>

<p id="id00517" class="calibre1">"'e's singin' out for some one to go aft an' relieve ther wheel," said
Quoin, who had gone to the door to listen. "Yer'd better 'urry up,
Plummer."</p>

<p id="id00518" class="calibre1">"What's ther time?" asked Plummer, standing up and knocking out his
pipe. "Must be close on ter four bells, 'oo's next wheel is it?"</p>

<p id="id00519" class="calibre1">"It's all right, Plummer," I said, getting up from the chest on which I
had been sitting. "I'll go along. It's my wheel, and it only wants a
couple of minutes to four bells."</p>

<p id="id00520" class="calibre1">Plummer sat down again, and I went out of the fo'cas'le. Reaching the
poop, I met Tammy on the lee side, pacing up and down.</p>

<p id="id00521" class="calibre1">"Who's at the wheel?" I asked him, in astonishment.</p>

<p id="id00522" class="calibre1">"The Second Mate," he said, in a shaky sort of voice. "He's waiting to
be relieved. I'll tell you all about it as soon as I get a chance."</p>

<p id="id00523" class="calibre1">I went on aft to the wheel.</p>

<p id="id00524" class="calibre1">"Who's that?" the Second inquired.</p>

<p id="id00525" class="calibre1">"It's Jessop, Sir," I answered.</p>

<p id="id00526" class="calibre1">He gave me the course, and then, without another word, went forrard
along the poop. On the break, I heard him call Tammy's name, and then
for some minutes he was talking to him; though what he was saying, I
could not possibly hear. For my part, I was tremendously curious to know
why the Second Mate had taken the wheel. I knew that if it were just a
matter of bad steering on Tammy's part, he would not have dreamt of
doing such a thing. There had been something queer happening, about
which I had yet to learn; of this, I felt sure.</p>

<p id="id00527" class="calibre1">Presently, the Second Mate left Tammy, and commenced to walk the weather
side of the deck. Once he came right aft, and, stooping down, peered
under the wheel-box; but never addressed a word to me. Sometime later,
he went down the weather ladder on to the main-deck. Directly
afterwards, Tammy came running up to the lee side of the wheel-box.</p>

<p id="id00528" class="calibre1">"I've seen it again!" he said, gasping with sheer nervousness.</p>

<p id="id00529" class="calibre1">"What?" I said.</p>

<p id="id00530" class="calibre1">"That <i class="calibre7">thing</i>," he answered. Then he leant across the wheel-box, and
lowered his voice.</p>

<p id="id00531" class="calibre1">"It came over the lee rail—<i class="calibre7">up out of the sea</i>," he added, with an air
of telling something unbelievable.</p>

<p id="id00532" class="calibre1">I turned more towards him; but it was too dark to see his face with any
distinctness. I felt suddenly husky. "My God!" I thought. And then I
made a silly effort to protest; but he cut me short with a certain
impatient hopelessness.</p>

<p id="id00533" class="calibre1">"For God's sake, Jessop," he said, "do stow all that! It's no good. I
must have someone to talk to, or I shall go dotty."</p>

<p id="id00534" class="calibre1">I saw how useless it was to pretend any sort of ignorance. Indeed,
really, I had known it all along, and avoided the youngster on that very
account, as you know.</p>

<p id="id00535" class="calibre1">"Go on," I said. "I'll listen; but you'd better keep an eye for the<br class="calibre10"/>

Second Mate; he may pop up any minute."<br class="calibre10"/>
</p>

<p id="id00536" class="calibre1">For a moment, he said nothing, and I saw him peering stealthily about
the poop.</p>

<p id="id00537" class="calibre1">"Go on," I said. "You'd better make haste, or he'll be up before you're
half-way through. What was he doing at the wheel when I came up to
relieve it? Why did he send you away from it?"</p>

<p id="id00538" class="calibre1">"He didn't," Tammy replied, turning his face towards me. "I bunked away
from it."</p>

<p id="id00539" class="calibre1">"What for?" I asked.</p>

<p id="id00540" class="calibre1">"Wait a minute," he answered, "and I'll tell you the whole business. You
know the Second Mate sent me to the wheel, after <i class="calibre7">that</i>—" He nodded his
head forrard.</p>

<p id="id00541" class="calibre1">"Yes," I said.</p>

<p id="id00542" class="calibre1">"Well, I'd been here about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, and I
was feeling rotten about Williams, and trying to forget it all and keep
the ship on her course, and all that; when, all at once, I happened to
glance to loo'ard, and there I saw it climbing over the rail. My God! I
didn't know what to do. The Second Mate was standing forrard on the
break of the poop, and I was here all by myself. I felt as if I were
frozen stiff. When it came towards me, I let go of the wheel, and yelled
and bunked forrard to the Second Mate. He caught hold of me and shook
me; but I was so jolly frightened, I couldn't say a word. I could only
keep on pointing. The Second kept asking me 'Where?' And then, all at
once, I found I couldn't see the thing. I don't know whether he saw it.
I'm not at all certain he did. He just told me to damn well get back to
the wheel, and stop making a damned fool of myself. I said out straight
I wouldn't go. So he blew his whistle, and sung out for someone to come
aft and take it. Then he ran and got hold of the wheel himself. You know
the rest."</p>

<p id="id00543" class="calibre1">"You're quite sure it wasn't thinking about Williams made you imagine
you saw something?" I said, more to gain a moment to think, than because
I believed that it was the case.</p>

<p id="id00544" class="calibre1">"I thought you were going to listen to me, seriously!" he said,
bitterly. "If you won't believe me; what about the chap the Second Mate
saw? What about Tom? What about Williams? For goodness sake! don't try
to put me off like you did last time. I nearly went cracked with wanting
to tell someone who would listen to me, and wouldn't laugh. I could
stand anything, but this being alone. There's a good chap, don't pretend
you don't understand. Tell me what it all means. What is this horrible
man that I've twice seen? You know you know something, and I believe
you're afraid to tell anyone, for fear of being laughed at. Why don't
you tell me? You needn't be afraid of my laughing."</p>

<p id="id00545" class="calibre1">He stopped, suddenly. For the moment, I said nothing in reply.</p>

<p id="id00546" class="calibre1">"Don't treat me like a kid, Jessop!" he exclaimed, quite passionately.</p>

<p id="id00547" class="calibre1">"I won't," I said, with a sudden resolve to tell him everything. "I need
someone to talk to, just as badly as you do."</p>

<p id="id00548" class="calibre1">"What does it all mean, then?" he burst out. "Are they real? I always
used to think it was all a yarn about such things."</p>

<p id="id00549" class="calibre1">"I'm sure I don't know what it all means, Tammy," I answered. "I'm just
as much in the dark, there, as you are. And I don't know whether they're
real—that is, not as we consider things real. You don't know that I saw
a queer figure down on the maindeck, several nights before you saw that
thing up here."</p>

<p id="id00550" class="calibre1">"Didn't you see this one?" he cut in, quickly.</p>

<p id="id00551" class="calibre1">"Yes," I answered.</p>

<p id="id00552" class="calibre1">"Then, why did you pretend not to have?" he said, in a reproachful
voice. "You don't know what a state you put me into, what with my being
certain that I had seen it and then you being so jolly positive that
there had been nothing. At one time I thought I was going clean off my
dot—until the Second Mate saw that man go up the main. Then, I knew
that there must be something in the thing I was certain I'd seen."</p>

<p id="id00553" class="calibre1">"I thought, perhaps, that if I told you I hadn't seen it, you would
think you'd been mistaken," I said. "I wanted you to think it was
imagination, or a dream, or something of that sort."</p>

<p id="id00554" class="calibre1">"And all the time, you knew about that other thing you'd seen?" he
asked.</p>

<p id="id00555" class="calibre1">"Yes," I replied.</p>

<p id="id00556" class="calibre1">"It was thundering decent of you," he said. "But it wasn't any good."</p>

<p id="id00557" class="calibre1">He paused a moment. Then he went on:</p>

<p id="id00558" class="calibre1">"It's terrible about Williams. Do you think he saw something, up aloft?"</p>

<p id="id00559" class="calibre1">"I don't know, Tammy," I said. "It's impossible to say. It <i class="calibre7">may</i> have
been only an accident." I hesitated to tell him what I really thought.</p>

<p id="id00560" class="calibre1">"What was he saying about his pay-day? Who was he saying it to?"</p>

<p id="id00561" class="calibre1">"I don't know," I said, again. "He was always cracked about taking a
pay-day out of her. You know, he stayed in her, on purpose, when all the
others left. He told me that he wasn't going to be done out of it, for
anyone."</p>

<p id="id00562" class="calibre1">"What did the other lot leave for?" he asked. Then, as the idea seemed
to strike him—"Jove! do you think they saw something, and got scared?
It's quite possible. You know, we only joined her in 'Frisco. She had no
'prentices on the passage out. Our ship was sold; so they sent us aboard
here to come home."</p>

<p id="id00563" class="calibre1">"They may have," I said. "Indeed, from things I've heard Williams say,
I'm pretty certain, he for one, guessed or knew a jolly sight more than
we've any idea of."</p>

<p id="id00564" class="calibre1">"And now he's dead!" said Tammy, solemnly. "We'll never be able to find
out from him now."</p>

<p id="id00565" class="calibre1">For a few moments, he was silent. Then he went off on another track.</p>

<p id="id00566" class="calibre1">"Doesn't anything ever happen in the Mate's watch?"</p>

<p id="id00567" class="calibre1">"Yes," I answered. "There's several things happened lately, that seem
pretty queer. Some of his side have been talking about them. But he's
too jolly pig-headed to see anything. He just curses his chaps, and puts
it all down to them."</p>

<p id="id00568" class="calibre1">"Still," he persisted, "things seem to happen more in our watch than in
his—I mean, bigger things. Look at tonight."</p>

<p id="id00569" class="calibre1">"We've no proof, you know," I said.</p>

<p id="id00570" class="calibre1">He shook his head, doubtfully.</p>

<p id="id00571" class="calibre1">"I shall always funk going aloft, now."</p>

<p id="id00572" class="calibre1">"Nonsense!" I told him. "It may only have been an accident."</p>

<p id="id00573" class="calibre1">"Don't!" he said. "You know you don't think so, really."</p>

<p id="id00574" class="calibre1">I answered nothing, just then; for I knew very well that he was right.<br class="calibre10"/>

We were silent for a couple of moments.<br class="calibre10"/>
</p>

<p id="id00575" class="calibre1">Then he spoke again:</p>

<p id="id00576" class="calibre1">"Is the ship haunted?"</p>

<p id="id00577" class="calibre1">For an instant I hesitated.</p>

<p id="id00578" class="calibre1">"No," I said, at length. "I don't think she is. I mean, not in that
way."</p>

<p id="id00579" class="calibre1">"What way, then?"</p>

<p id="id00580" class="calibre1">"Well, I've formed a bit of a theory, that seems wise one minute, and
cracked the next. Of course, it's as likely to be all wrong; but it's
the only thing that seems to me to fit in with all the beastly things
we've had lately."</p>

<p id="id00581" class="calibre1">"Go on!" he said, with an impatient, nervous movement.</p>

<p id="id00582" class="calibre1">"Well, I've an idea that it's nothing <i class="calibre7">in</i> the ship that's likely to
hurt us. I scarcely know how to put it; but, if I'm right in what I
think, it's the ship herself that's the cause of everything."</p>

<p id="id00583" class="calibre1">"What do you mean?" he asked, in a puzzled voice. "Do you mean that the
ship <i class="calibre7">is</i> haunted, after all?"</p>

<p id="id00584" class="calibre1">"No!" I answered. "I've just told you I didn't. Wait until I've finished
what I was going to say."</p>

<p id="id00585" class="calibre1">"All right!" he said.</p>

<p id="id00586" class="calibre1">"About that thing you saw tonight," I went on. "You say it came over the
lee rail, up on to the poop?"</p>

<p id="id00587" class="calibre1">"Yes," he answered.</p>

<p id="id00588" class="calibre1">"Well, the thing I saw, <i class="calibre7">came up out of the sea, and went back into the
sea</i>."</p>

<p id="id00589" class="calibre1">"Jove!" he said; and then: "Yes, go on!"</p>

<p id="id00590" class="calibre1">"My idea is, that this ship is open to be boarded by those things," I
explained. "What they are, of course I don't know. They look like men—
in lots of ways. But—well, the Lord knows what's in the sea. Though we
don't want to go imagining silly things, of course. And then, again, you
know, it seems fat-headed, calling anything silly. That's how I keep
going, in a sort of blessed circle. I don't know a bit whether they're
flesh and blood, or whether they're what we should call ghosts or
spirits."</p>

<p id="id00591" class="calibre1">"They can't be flesh and blood," Tammy interrupted. "Where would they
live? Besides, that first one I saw, I thought I could see through it.
And this last one—the Second Mate would have seen it. And they would
drown—"</p>

<p id="id00592" class="calibre1">"Not necessarily," I said.</p>

<p id="id00593" class="calibre1">"Oh, but I'm sure they're not," he insisted. "It's impossible—"</p>

<p id="id00594" class="calibre1">"So are ghosts—when you're feeling sensible," I answered. "But I'm not
saying they <i class="calibre7">are</i> flesh and blood; though, at the same time, I'm not
going to say straight out they're ghosts—not yet, at any rate."</p>

<p id="id00595" class="calibre1">"Where do they come from?" he asked, stupidly enough.</p>

<p id="id00596" class="calibre1">"Out of the sea," I told him. "You saw for yourself!"</p>

<p id="id00597" class="calibre1">"Then why don't other vessels have them coming aboard?" he said. "How do
you account for that?"</p>

<p id="id00598" class="calibre1">"In a way—though sometimes it seems cracky—I think I can, according to
my idea," I answered.</p>

<p id="id00599" class="calibre1">"How?" he inquired again.</p>

<p id="id00600" class="calibre1">"Why, I believe that this ship is open, as I've told you—exposed,
unprotected, or whatever you like to call it. I should say it's
reasonable to think that all the things of the material world are
barred, as it were, from the immaterial; but that in some cases the
barrier may be broken down. That's what may have happened to this ship.
And if it has, she may be naked to the attacks of beings belonging to
some other state of existence."</p>

<p id="id00601" class="calibre1">"What's made her like that?" he asked, in a really awed sort of tone.</p>

<p id="id00602" class="calibre1">"The Lord knows!" I answered. "Perhaps something to do with magnetic
stresses; but you'd not understand, and I don't, really. And, I suppose,
inside of me, I don't believe it's anything of the kind, for a minute.
I'm not built that way. And yet I don't know! Perhaps, there may have
been some rotten thing done aboard of her. Or, again, it's a heap more
likely to be something quite outside of anything I know."</p>

<p id="id00603" class="calibre1">"If they're immaterial then, they're spirits?" he questioned.</p>

<p id="id00604" class="calibre1">"I don't know," I said. "It's so hard to say what I really think, you
know. I've got a queer idea, that my head-piece likes to think good; but
I don't believe my tummy believes it."</p>

<p id="id00605" class="calibre1">"Go on!" he said.</p>

<p id="id00606" class="calibre1">"Well," I said. "Suppose the earth were inhabited by two kinds of life.<br class="calibre10"/>

We're one, and <i class="calibre7">they're</i> the other."<br class="calibre10"/>
</p>

<p id="id00607" class="calibre1">"Go on!" he said.</p>

<p id="id00608" class="calibre1">"Well," I said. "Don't you see, in a normal state we may not be capable
of appreciating the <i class="calibre7">realness</i> of the other? But they may be just as
<i class="calibre7">real</i> and material to <i class="calibre7">them</i>, as <i class="calibre7">we</i> are to <i class="calibre7">us</i>. Do you see?"</p>

<p id="id00609" class="calibre1">"Yes," he said. "Go on!"</p>

<p id="id00610" class="calibre1">"Well," I said. "The earth may be just as <i class="calibre7">real</i> to them, as to us. I
mean that it may have qualities as material to them, as it has to us;
but neither of us could appreciate the other's realness, or the quality
of realness in the earth, which was real to the other. It's so difficult
to explain. Don't you understand?"</p>

<p id="id00611" class="calibre1">"Yes," he said. "Go on!"</p>

<p id="id00612" class="calibre1">"Well, if we were in what I might call a healthy atmosphere, they would
be quite beyond our power to see or feel, or anything. And the same with
them; but the more we're like <i class="calibre7">this</i>, the more <i class="calibre7">real</i> and actual they
could grow <i class="calibre7">to us</i>. See? That is, the more we should become able to
appreciate their form of materialness. That's all. I can't make it any
clearer."</p>

<p id="id00613" class="calibre1">"Then, after all, you <i class="calibre7">really</i> think they're ghosts, or something of
that sort?" Tammy said.</p>

<p id="id00614" class="calibre1">"I suppose it does come to that," I answered. "I mean that, anyway, I
don't think they're our ideas of flesh and blood. But, of course, it's
silly to say much; and, after all, you must remember that I may be all
wrong."</p>

<p id="id00615" class="calibre1">"I think you ought to tell the Second Mate all this," he said. "If it's
really as you say, the ship ought to be put into the nearest port, and
jolly well burnt."</p>

<p id="id00616" class="calibre1">"The Second Mate couldn't do anything," I replied. "Even if he believed
it all; which we're not certain he would."</p>

<p id="id00617" class="calibre1">"Perhaps not," Tammy answered. "But if you could get him to believe it,
he might explain the whole business to the Skipper, and then something
might be done. It's not safe as it is."</p>

<p id="id00618" class="calibre1">"He'd only get jeered at again," I said, rather hopelessly.</p>

<p id="id00619" class="calibre1">"No," said Tammy. "Not after what's happened tonight."</p>

<p id="id00620" class="calibre1">"Perhaps not," I replied, doubtfully. And just then the Second Mate came
back on to the poop, and Tammy cleared away from the wheel-box, leaving
me with a worrying feeling that I ought to do something.</p>

<div class="calibre4"></div><h2 id="id00621" class="calibre5">VII</h2>

<p id="id00622" class="calibre2"><i class="calibre7">The Coming of the Mist and That Which It Ushered</i></p>

<p id="id00623" class="calibre1">We buried Williams at midday. Poor beggar! It had been so sudden. All
day the men were awed and gloomy, and there was a lot of talk about
there being a Jonah aboard. If they'd only known what Tammy and I, and
perhaps the Second Mate, knew!</p>

<p id="id00624" class="calibre1">And then the next thing came—the mist. I cannot remember now, whether
it was on the day we buried Williams that we first saw it, or the day
after.</p>

<p id="id00625" class="calibre1">When first I noticed it, like everybody else aboard, I took it to be
some form of haze, due to the heat of the sun; for it was broad daylight
when the thing came.</p>

<p id="id00626" class="calibre1">The wind had died away to a light breeze, and I was working at the main
rigging, along with Plummer, putting on seizings.</p>

<p id="id00627" class="calibre1">"Looks as if 'twere middlin' 'ot," he remarked.</p>

<p id="id00628" class="calibre1">"Yes," I said; and, for the time, took no further notice.</p>

<p id="id00629" class="calibre1">Presently he spoke again:</p>

<p id="id00630" class="calibre1">"It's gettin' quite 'azy!" and his tone showed he was surprised.</p>

<p id="id00631" class="calibre1">I glanced up, quickly. At first, I could see nothing. Then, I saw what
he meant. The air had a wavy, strange, unnatural appearance; something
like the heated air over the top of an engine's funnel, that you can
often see when no smoke is coming out.</p>

<p id="id00632" class="calibre1">"Must be the heat," I said. "Though I don't remember ever seeing
anything just like it before."</p>

<p id="id00633" class="calibre1">"Nor me," Plummer agreed.</p>

<p id="id00634" class="calibre1">It could not have been a minute later when I looked up again, and was
astonished to find that the whole ship was surrounded by a thinnish haze
that quite hid the horizon.</p>

<p id="id00635" class="calibre1">"By Jove! Plummer," I said. "How queer!"</p>

<p id="id00636" class="calibre1">"Yes," he said, looking round. "I never seen anythin' like it before—
not in these parts."</p>

<p id="id00637" class="calibre1">"Heat wouldn't do that!" I said.</p>

<p id="id00638" class="calibre1">"N—no," he said, doubtfully.</p>

<p id="id00639" class="calibre1">We went on with our work again—occasionally exchanging an odd word or
two. Presently, after a little time of silence, I bent forward and asked
him to pass me up the spike. He stooped and picked it up from the deck,
where it had tumbled. As he held it out to me, I saw the stolid
expression on his face, change suddenly to a look of complete surprise.
He opened his mouth.</p>

<p id="id00640" class="calibre1">"By gum!" he said. "It's gone."</p>

<p id="id00641" class="calibre1">I turned quickly, and looked. And so it had—the whole sea showing clear
and bright, right away to the horizon.</p>

<p id="id00642" class="calibre1">I stared at Plummer, and he stared at me.</p>

<p id="id00643" class="calibre1">"Well, I'm blowed!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p id="id00644" class="calibre1">I do not think I made any reply; for I had a sudden, queer feeling that
the thing was not right. And then, in a minute, I called myself an ass;
but I could not really shake off the feeling. I had another good look at
the sea. I had a vague idea that something was different. The sea looked
brighter, somehow, and the air clearer, I thought, and I missed
something; but not much, you know. And it was not until a couple of days
later, that I knew that it was several vessels on the horizon, which had
been quite in sight before the mist, and now were gone.</p>

<p id="id00645" class="calibre1">During the rest of the watch, and indeed all day, there was no further
sign of anything unusual. Only, when the evening came (in the second
dog-watch it was) I saw the mist rise faintly—the setting sun shining
through it, dim and unreal.</p>

<p id="id00646" class="calibre1">I knew then, as a certainty, that it was not caused by heat.</p>

<p id="id00647" class="calibre1">And that was the beginning of it.</p>

<p id="id00648" class="calibre1">The next day, I kept a pretty close watch, during all my time on deck;
but the atmosphere remained clear. Yet, I heard from one of the chaps in
the Mate's watch, that it had been hazy during part of the time he was
at the wheel.</p>

<p id="id00649" class="calibre1">"Comin' an' goin', like," he described it to me, when I questioned him
about it. He thought it might be heat.</p>

<p id="id00650" class="calibre1">But though I knew otherwise, I did not contradict him. At that time, no
one, not even Plummer, seemed to think very much of the matter. And when
I mentioned it to Tammy, and asked him whether he'd noticed it, he only
remarked that it must have been heat, or else the sun drawing up water.
I let it stay at that; for there was nothing to be gained by suggesting
that the thing had more to it.</p>

<p id="id00651" class="calibre1">Then, on the following day, something happened that set me wondering
more than ever, and showed me how right I had been in feeling the mist
to be something unnatural. It was in this way.</p>

<p id="id00652" class="calibre1">Five bells, in the eight to twelve morning watch, had gone. I was at the
wheel. The sky was perfectly clear—not a cloud to be seen, even on the
horizon. It was hot, standing at the wheel; for there was scarcely any
wind, and I was feeling drowsy. The Second Mate was down on the maindeck
with the men, seeing about some job he wanted done; so that I was on the
poop alone.</p>

<p id="id00653" class="calibre1">Presently, with the heat, and the sun beating right down on to me, I
grew thirsty; and, for want of something better, I pulled out a bit of
plug I had on me, and bit off a chew; though, as a rule, it is not a
habit of mine. After a little, naturally enough, I glanced round for the
spittoon; but discovered that it was not there. Probably it had been
taken forrard when the decks were washed, to give it a scrub. So, as
there was no one on the poop, I left the wheel, and stepped aft to the
taffrail. It was thus that I came to see something altogether unthought
of—a full-rigged ship, close-hauled on the port tack, a few hundred
yards on our starboard quarter. Her sails were scarcely filled by the
light breeze, and flapped as she lifted to the swell of the sea. She
appeared to have very little way through the water, certainly not more
than a knot an hour. Away aft, hanging from the gaff-end, was a string
of flags. Evidently, she was signalling to us. All this, I saw in a
flash, and I just stood and stared, astonished. I was astonished because
I had not seen her earlier. In that light breeze, I knew that she must
have been in sight for at least a couple of hours. Yet I could think of
nothing rational to satisfy my wonder. There she was—of that much, I
was certain. And yet, how had she come there without my seeing her,
before?</p>

<p id="id00654" class="calibre1">All at once, as I stood, staring, I heard the wheel behind me, spin
rapidly. Instinctively, I jumped to get hold of the spokes; for I did
not want the steering gear jammed. Then I turned again to have another
look at the other ship; but, to my utter bewilderment, <i class="calibre7">there was no
sign of her</i>—nothing but the calm ocean, spreading away to the distant
horizon. I blinked my eyelids a bit, and pushed the hair off my
forehead. Then, I stared again; but there was no vestige of her—
nothing, you know; and absolutely nothing unusual, except a faint,
tremulous quiver in the air. And the blank surface of the sea reaching
everywhere to the empty horizon.</p>

<p id="id00655" class="calibre1">Had she foundered? I asked myself, naturally enough; and, for the
moment, I really wondered. I searched round the sea for wreckage; but
there was nothing, not even an odd hen-coop, or a piece of deck
furniture; and so I threw away that idea, as impossible.</p>

<p id="id00656" class="calibre1">Then, as I stood, I got another thought, or, perhaps, an intuition and I
asked myself seriously whether this disappearing ship might not be in
some way connected with the other queer things. It occurred to me then,
that the vessel I had seen was nothing real, and, perhaps, did not exist
outside of my own brain. I considered the idea, gravely. It helped to
explain the thing, and I could think of nothing else that would. Had she
been real, I felt sure that others aboard us would have been bound to
have seen her long before I had—I got a bit muddled there, with trying
to think it out; and then, abruptly, the reality of the other ship, came
back to me—every rope and sail and spar, you know. And I remembered how
she had lifted to the heave of the sea, and how the sails had flapped in
the light breeze. And the string of flags! She had been signalling. At
that last, I found it just as impossible to believe that she had not
been real.</p>

<p id="id00657" class="calibre1">I had reached to this point of irresolution, and was standing with my
back, partly turned to the wheel. I was holding it steady with my left
hand, while I looked over the sea, to try to find something to help me
to understand.</p>

<p id="id00658" class="calibre1">All at once, as I stared, I seemed to see the ship again.</p>

<p id="id00659" class="calibre1">She was more on the beam now, than on the quarter; but I thought little
of that, in the astonishment of seeing her once more. It was only a
glimpse, I caught of her—dim and wavering, as though I looked at her
through the convolutions of heated air. Then she grew indistinct, and
vanished again; but I was convinced now that she was real, and had been
in sight all the time, if I could have seen her. That curious, dim,
wavering appearance had suggested something to me. I remembered the
strange, wavy look of the air, a few days previously, just before the
mist had surrounded the ship. And in my mind, I connected the two. It
was nothing about the other packet that was strange. The strangeness was
with us. It was something that was about (or invested) our ship that
prevented me—or indeed, any one else aboard from seeing that other. It
was evident that she had been able to see us, as was proved by her
signalling. In an irrelevant sort of way, I wondered what the people
aboard of her thought of our apparently intentional disregard of their
signals.</p>

<p id="id00660" class="calibre1">After that, I thought of the strangeness of it all. Even at that minute,
they could see us, plainly; and yet, so far as we were concerned, the
whole ocean seemed empty. It appeared to me, at that time, to be the
weirdest thing that could happen to us.</p>

<p id="id00661" class="calibre1">And then a fresh thought came to me. How long had we been like that? I
puzzled for a few moments. It was now that I recollected that we had
sighted several vessels on the morning of the day when the mist
appeared; and since then, we had seen nothing. This, to say the least,
should have struck me as queer; for some of the other packets were
homeward bound along with us, and steering the same course.
Consequently, with the weather being fine, and the wind next to nothing,
they should have been in sight all the time. This reasoning seemed to me
to show, unmistakably, some connection between the coming of the mist,
and our inability to <i class="calibre7">see</i>. So that it is possible we had been in that
extraordinary state of blindness for nearly three days.</p>

<p id="id00662" class="calibre1">In my mind, the last glimpse of that ship on the quarter, came back to
me. And, I remember, a curious thought got me, that I had looked at her
from out of some other dimension. For a while, you know, I really
believed the mystery of the idea, and that it might be the actual truth,
took me; instead of my realising just all that it might mean. It seemed
so exactly to express all the half-defined thoughts that had come, since
seeing that other packet on the quarter.</p>

<p id="id00663" class="calibre1">Suddenly, behind me, there came a rustle and rattle of the sails; and,
in the same instant, I heard the Skipper saying:</p>

<p id="id00664" class="calibre1">"Where the devil have you got her to, Jessop?"</p>

<p id="id00665" class="calibre1">I whirled round to the wheel.</p>

<p id="id00666" class="calibre1">"I don't know—Sir," I faltered.</p>

<p id="id00667" class="calibre1">I had forgotten even that I was at the wheel.</p>

<p id="id00668" class="calibre1">"Don't know!" he shouted. "I should damned well think you don't.<br class="calibre10"/>

Starboard your helm, you fool. You'll have us all aback!"<br class="calibre10"/>
</p>

<p id="id00669" class="calibre1">"i, i, Sir," I answered, and hove the wheel over. I did it almost
mechanically; for I was still dazed, and had not yet had time to collect
my senses.</p>

<p id="id00670" class="calibre1">During the following half-minute, I was only conscious, in a confused
sort of way, that the Old Man was ranting at me. This feeling of
bewilderment passed off, and I found that I was peering blankly into the
binnacle, at the compass-card; yet, until then, entirely without being
aware of the fact. Now, however, I saw that the ship was coming back on
to her course. Goodness knows how much she had been off!</p>

<p id="id00671" class="calibre1">With the realisation that I had let the ship get almost aback, there
came a sudden memory of the alteration in the position of the other
vessel. She had appeared last on the beam, instead of on the quarter.
Now, however, as my brain began to work, I saw the cause of this
apparent and, until then, inexplicable change. It was due, of course, to
our having come up, until we had brought the other packet on to the
beam.</p>

<p id="id00672" class="calibre1">It is curious how all this flashed through my mind, and held my
attention—although only momentarily—in the face of the Skipper's
storming. I think I had hardly realised he was still singing out at me.
Anyhow, the next thing I remember, he was shaking my arm.</p>

<p id="id00673" class="calibre1">"What's the matter with you, man?" he was shouting. And I just stared
into his face, like an ass, without saying a word. I seemed still
incapable, you know, of actual, reasoning speech.</p>

<p id="id00674" class="calibre1">"Are you damned well off your head?" he went on shouting. "Are you a
lunatic? Have you had sunstroke? Speak, you gaping idiot!"</p>

<p id="id00675" class="calibre1">I tried to say something; but the words would not come clearly.</p>

<p id="id00676" class="calibre1">"I—I—I—" I said, and stopped, stupidly. I was all right, really; but
I was so bewildered with the thing I had found out; and, in a way, I
seemed almost to have come back out of a distance, you know.</p>

<p id="id00677" class="calibre1">"You're a lunatic!" he said, again. He repeated the statement several
times, as if it were the only thing that sufficiently expressed his
opinion of me. Then he let go of my arm, and stepped back a couple of
paces.</p>

<p id="id00678" class="calibre1">"I'm not a lunatic!" I said, with a sudden gasp. "I'm not a lunatic,<br class="calibre10"/>

Sir, any more than you are."<br class="calibre10"/>
</p>

<p id="id00679" class="calibre1">"Why the devil don't you answer my questions then?" he shouted, angrily.<br class="calibre10"/>

"What's the matter with you? What have you been doing with the ship?<br class="calibre10"/>

Answer me now!"<br class="calibre10"/>
</p>

<p id="id00680" class="calibre1">"I was looking at that ship away on the starboard quarter, Sir," I
blurted out. "She's been signalling—"</p>

<p id="id00681" class="calibre1">"What!" he cut me short with disbelief. "What ship?"</p>

<p id="id00682" class="calibre1">He turned, quickly, and looked over the quarter. Then he wheeled round
to me again.</p>

<p id="id00683" class="calibre1">"There's no ship! What do you mean by trying to spin up a cuffer like
that?"</p>

<p id="id00684" class="calibre1">"There is, Sir," I answered. "It's out there—" I pointed.</p>

<p id="id00685" class="calibre1">"Hold your tongue!" he said. "Don't talk rubbish to me. Do you think I'm
blind?"</p>

<p id="id00686" class="calibre1">"I saw it, Sir," I persisted.</p>

<p id="id00687" class="calibre1">"Don't you talk back to me!" he snapped, with a quick burst of temper.<br class="calibre10"/>

"I won't have it!"<br class="calibre10"/>
</p>

<p id="id00688" class="calibre1">Then, just as suddenly, he was silent. He came a step towards me, and
stared into my face. I believe the old ass thought I was a bit mad;
anyway, without another word, he went to the break of the poop.</p>

<p id="id00689" class="calibre1">"Mr. Tulipson," he sung out.</p>

<p id="id00690" class="calibre1">"Yes, Sir," I heard the Second Mate reply.</p>

<p id="id00691" class="calibre1">"Send another man to the wheel."</p>

<p id="id00692" class="calibre1">"Very good, Sir," the Second answered.</p>

<p id="id00693" class="calibre1">A couple of minutes later, old Jaskett came up to relieve me. I gave him
the course, and he repeated it.</p>

<p id="id00694" class="calibre1">"What's up, mate?" he asked me, as I stepped off the grating.</p>

<p id="id00695" class="calibre1">"Nothing much," I said, and went forrard to where the Skipper was
standing on the break of the poop. I gave him the course; but the crabby
old devil took no notice of me, whatever. When I got down on to the
maindeck, I went up to the Second, and gave it to him. He answered me
civilly enough, and then asked me what I had been doing to put the Old
Man's back up.</p>

<p id="id00696" class="calibre1">"I told him there's a ship on the starboard quarter, signalling us," I
said.</p>

<p id="id00697" class="calibre1">"There's no ship out there, Jessop," the Second Mate replied, looking at
me with a queer, inscrutable expression.</p>

<p id="id00698" class="calibre1">"There is, Sir," I began. "I—"</p>

<p id="id00699" class="calibre1">"That will do, Jessop!" he said. "Go forrard and have a smoke. I shall
want you then to give a hand with these foot-ropes. You'd better bring a
serving-mallet aft with you, when you come."</p>

<p id="id00700" class="calibre1">I hesitated a moment, partly in anger; but more, I think, in doubt.</p>

<p id="id00701" class="calibre1">"i, i, Sir," I muttered at length, and went forrard.</p>
