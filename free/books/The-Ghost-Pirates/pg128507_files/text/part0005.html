<h4 id="id01853" class="calibre14">Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h4>

<p id="id01854" class="calibre1">Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p id="id01855" class="calibre1">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.</p>

<h4 id="id01856" class="calibre14">Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

<h5 id="id01860" class="calibre13">Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h5>

<p id="id01861" class="calibre1">Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p id="id01862" class="calibre1">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org</p>

<p id="id01863" class="calibre1">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p id="id01864" class="calibre1">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p id="id01865" class="calibre1">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate</p>

<h4 id="id01866" class="calibre14">Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h4>

<p id="id01867" class="calibre1">Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p id="id01868" class="calibre1">Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p id="id01869" class="calibre1">Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p>

<p id="id01870" class="calibre1">Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.</p>

<p id="id01871" class="calibre1">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:</p>

<p id="id01872" class="calibre1">     http://www.gutenberg.net<br class="calibre10"/>
</p>

<p id="id01873" class="calibre1">This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>

<p id="id01874" class="calibre1">EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.</p>

<p id="id01875" class="calibre1">     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06<br class="calibre10"/>
</p>

<p id="id01876" class="calibre1">    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,<br class="calibre10"/>

     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)<br class="calibre10"/>
</p>

<p id="id01877" class="calibre1">EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:</p>

<p id="id01878" class="calibre1">     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234<br class="calibre10"/>
</p>

<p id="id01879" class="calibre1">or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689</p>

<p id="id01880" class="calibre1">An alternative method of locating eBooks:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL</p>
