<p id="id01512" class="calibre2"><i class="calibre7">The Ghost Ships</i></p>

<p id="id01513" class="calibre2">At four o'clock, when again we went on deck, the Second Mate told me to
go on with a paunch mat I was making; while Tammy, he sent to get out
his sinnet. I had the mat slug on the fore side of the mainmast, between
it and the after end of the house; and, in a few minutes, Tammy brought
his sinnet and yarns to the mast, and made fast to one of the pins.</p>

<p id="id01514" class="calibre1">"What do you think it was, Jessop?" he asked, abruptly, after a short
silence.</p>

<p id="id01515" class="calibre1">I looked at him.</p>

<p id="id01516" class="calibre1">"What do you think?" I replied.</p>

<p id="id01517" class="calibre1">"I don't know what to think," he said. "But I've a feeling that it's
something to do with all the rest," and he indicated aloft, with his
head.</p>

<p id="id01518" class="calibre1">"I've been thinking, too," I remarked.</p>

<p id="id01519" class="calibre1">"That it is?" he inquired.</p>

<p id="id01520" class="calibre1">"Yes," I answered, and told him how the idea had come to me at my
dinner, that the strange men-shadows which came aboard, might come from
that indistinct vessel we had seen down in the sea.</p>

<p id="id01521" class="calibre1">"Good Lord!" he exclaimed, as he got my meaning. And then for a little,
he stood and thought.</p>

<p id="id01522" class="calibre1">"That's where they live, you mean?" he said, at last, and paused again.</p>

<p id="id01523" class="calibre1">"Well," I replied. "It can't be the sort of existence <i class="calibre7">we</i> should call
life."</p>

<p id="id01524" class="calibre1">He nodded, doubtfully.</p>

<p id="id01525" class="calibre1">"No," he said, and was silent again.</p>

<p id="id01526" class="calibre1">Presently, he put out an idea that had come to him.</p>

<p id="id01527" class="calibre1">"You <i class="calibre7">think</i>, then, that that—vessel has been with us for some time, if
we'd only known?" he asked.</p>

<p id="id01528" class="calibre1">"All along," I replied. "I mean ever since these things started."</p>

<p id="id01529" class="calibre1">"Supposing there are others," he said, suddenly.</p>

<p id="id01530" class="calibre1">I looked at him.</p>

<p id="id01531" class="calibre1">"If there are," I said. "You can pray to God that they won't stumble
across us. It strikes me that whether they're ghosts, or not ghosts,
they're blood-gutted pirates.</p>

<p id="id01532" class="calibre1">"It seems horrible," he said solemnly, "to be talking seriously like
this, about—you know, about such things."</p>

<p id="id01533" class="calibre1">"I've tried to stop thinking that way," I told him. "I've felt I should
go cracked, if I didn't. There's damned queer things happen at sea, I
know; but this isn't one of them."</p>

<p id="id01534" class="calibre1">"It seems so strange and unreal, one moment, doesn't it?" he said. "And
the next, you <i class="calibre7">know</i> it's really true, and you can't understand why you
didn't always know. And yet they'd never believe, if you told them
ashore about it."</p>

<p id="id01535" class="calibre1">"They'd believe, if they'd been in this packet in the middle watch this
morning," I said.</p>

<p id="id01536" class="calibre1">"Besides," I went on. "They don't understand. We didn't … I shall
always feel different now, when I read that some packet hasn't been
heard of."</p>

<p id="id01537" class="calibre1">Tammy stared at me.</p>

<p id="id01538" class="calibre1">"I've heard some of the old shellbacks talking about things," he said.<br class="calibre10"/>

"But I never took them really seriously."<br class="calibre10"/>
</p>

<p id="id01539" class="calibre1">"Well," I said. "I guess we'll have to take this seriously. I wish to<br class="calibre10"/>

God we were home!"<br class="calibre10"/>
</p>

<p id="id01540" class="calibre1">"My God! so do I," he said.</p>

<p id="id01541" class="calibre1">For a good while after that, we both worked on in silence; but,
presently, he went off on another tack.</p>

<p id="id01542" class="calibre1">"Do you think we'll really shorten her down every night before it gets
dark?" he asked.</p>

<p id="id01543" class="calibre1">"Certainly," I replied. "They'll never get the men to go aloft at night,
after what's happened."</p>

<p id="id01544" class="calibre1">"But, but—supposing they <i class="calibre7">ordered</i> us aloft—" he began.</p>

<p id="id01545" class="calibre1">"Would you go?" I interrupted.</p>

<p id="id01546" class="calibre1">"No!" he said, emphatically. "I'd jolly well be put in irons first!"</p>

<p id="id01547" class="calibre1">"That settles it, then," I replied. "You wouldn't go, nor would any one
else."</p>

<p id="id01548" class="calibre1">At this moment the Second Mate came along.</p>

<p id="id01549" class="calibre1">"Shove that mat and that sinnet away, you two," he said. "Then get your
brooms and clear up."</p>

<p id="id01550" class="calibre1">"i, i, Sir," we said, and he went on forrard.</p>

<p id="id01551" class="calibre1">"Jump on the house, Tammy," I said. "And let go the other end of this
rope, will you?"</p>

<p id="id01552" class="calibre1">"Right" he said, and did as I had asked him. When he came back, I got
him to give me a hand to roll up the mat, which was a very large one.</p>

<p id="id01553" class="calibre1">"I'll finish stopping it," I said. "You go and put your sinnet away."</p>

<p id="id01554" class="calibre1">"Wait a minute," he replied, and gathered up a double handful of shakins
from the deck, under where I had been working. Then he ran to the side.</p>

<p id="id01555" class="calibre1">"Here!" I said. "Don't go dumping those. They'll only float, and the<br class="calibre10"/>

Second Mate or the Skipper will be sure to spot them."<br class="calibre10"/>
</p>

<p id="id01556" class="calibre1">"Come here, Jessop!" he interrupted, in a low voice, and taking no
notice of what I had been saying.</p>

<p id="id01557" class="calibre1">I got up off the hatch, where I was kneeling. He was staring over the
side.</p>

<p id="id01558" class="calibre1">"What's up?" I asked.</p>

<p id="id01559" class="calibre1">"For God's sake, hurry!" he said, and I ran, and jumped on to the spar,
alongside of him.</p>

<p id="id01560" class="calibre1">"Look!" he said, and pointed with a handful of shakins, right down,
directly beneath us.</p>

<p id="id01561" class="calibre1">Some of the shakins dropped from his hand, and blurred the water,
momentarily, so that I could not see. Then, as the ripples cleared away,
I saw what he meant.</p>

<p id="id01562" class="calibre1">"Two of them!" he said, in a voice that was scarcely above a whisper.
"And there's another out there," and he pointed again with the handful
of shakins.</p>

<p id="id01563" class="calibre1">"There's another a little further aft," I muttered.</p>

<p id="id01564" class="calibre1">"Where?—where?" he asked.</p>

<p id="id01565" class="calibre1">"There," I said, and pointed.</p>

<p id="id01566" class="calibre1">"That's four," he whispered. "Four of them!"</p>

<p id="id01567" class="calibre1">I said nothing; but continued to stare. They appeared to me to be a
great way down in the sea, and quite motionless. Yet, though their
outlines were somewhat blurred and indistinct, there was no mistaking
that they were very like exact, though shadowy, representations of
vessels. For some minutes we watched them, without speaking. At last
Tammy spoke.</p>

<p id="id01568" class="calibre1">"They're real, right enough," he said, in a low voice.</p>

<p id="id01569" class="calibre1">"I don't know," I answered.</p>

<p id="id01570" class="calibre1">"I mean we weren't mistaken this morning," he said.</p>

<p id="id01571" class="calibre1">"No," I replied. "I never thought we were."</p>

<p id="id01572" class="calibre1">Away forrard, I heard the Second Mate, returning aft. He came nearer,
and saw us.</p>

<p id="id01573" class="calibre1">"What's up now, you two?" he called, sharply. "This isn't clearing up!"</p>

<p id="id01574" class="calibre1">I put out my hand to warn him not to shout, and draw the attention of
the rest of the men.</p>

<p id="id01575" class="calibre1">He took several steps towards me.</p>

<p id="id01576" class="calibre1">"What is it? what is it?" he said, with a certain irritability; but in a
lower voice.</p>

<p id="id01577" class="calibre1">"You'd better take a look over the side, Sir," I replied.</p>

<p id="id01578" class="calibre1">My tone must have given him an inkling that we had discovered something
fresh; for, at my words, he made one spring, and stood on the spar,
alongside of me.</p>

<p id="id01579" class="calibre1">"Look, Sir," said Tammy. "There's four of them."</p>

<p id="id01580" class="calibre1">The Second Mate glanced down, saw something and bent sharply forward.</p>

<p id="id01581" class="calibre1">"My God!" I heard him mutter, under his breath.</p>

<p id="id01582" class="calibre1">After that, for some half-minute, he stared, without a word.</p>

<p id="id01583" class="calibre1">"There are two more out there, Sir," I told him, and indicated the place
with my finger.</p>

<p id="id01584" class="calibre1">It was a little time before he managed to locate these and when he did,
he gave them only a short glance. Then he got down off the spar, and
spoke to us.</p>

<p id="id01585" class="calibre1">"Come down off there," he said, quickly. "Get your brooms and clear up.<br class="calibre10"/>

Don't say a word!—It may be nothing."<br class="calibre10"/>
</p>

<p id="id01586" class="calibre1">He appeared to add that last bit, as an afterthought, and we both knew
it meant nothing. Then he turned and went swiftly aft.</p>

<p id="id01587" class="calibre1">"I expect he's gone to tell the Old Man," Tammy remarked, as we went
forrard, carrying the mat and his sinnet.</p>

<p id="id01588" class="calibre1">"H'm," I said, scarcely noticing what he was saying; for I was full of
the thought of those four shadowy craft, waiting quietly down there.</p>

<p id="id01589" class="calibre1">We got our brooms, and went aft. On the way, the Second Mate and the
Skipper passed us. They went forrard too by the fore brace, and got up
on the spar. I saw the Second point up at the brace and he appeared to
be saying something about the gear. I guessed that this was done
purposely, to act as a blind, should any of the other men be looking.
Then the Old Man glanced down over the side, in a casual sort of manner;
so did the Second Mate. A minute or two later, they came aft, and went
back, up on to the poop. I caught a glimpse of the Skipper's face as he
passed me, on his return. He struck me as looking worried—bewildered,
perhaps, would be a better word.</p>

<p id="id01590" class="calibre1">Both Tammy and I were tremendously keen to have another look; but when
at last we got a chance, the sky reflected so much on the water, we
could see nothing below.</p>

<p id="id01591" class="calibre1">We had just finished sweeping up when four bells went, and we cleared
below for tea. Some of the men got chatting while they were grubbing.</p>

<p id="id01592" class="calibre1">"I 'ave 'eard," remarked Quoin, "as we're goin' ter shorten 'er down
afore dark."</p>

<p id="id01593" class="calibre1">"Eh?" said old Jaskett, over his pannikin of tea.</p>

<p id="id01594" class="calibre1">Quoin repeated his remark.</p>

<p id="id01595" class="calibre1">"'oo says so?" inquired Plummer.</p>

<p id="id01596" class="calibre1">"I 'eard it from ther Doc," answered Quoin, "'e got it from ther<br class="calibre10"/>

Stooard."<br class="calibre10"/>
</p>

<p id="id01597" class="calibre1">"'ow would 'ee know?" asked Plummer.</p>

<p id="id01598" class="calibre1">"I dunno," said Quoin. "I 'spect 'e's 'eard 'em talkin' 'bout it arft."</p>

<p id="id01599" class="calibre1">Plummer turned to me.</p>

<p id="id01600" class="calibre1">"'ave you 'eard anythin', Jessop?" he inquired.</p>

<p id="id01601" class="calibre1">"What, about shortening down?" I replied.</p>

<p id="id01602" class="calibre1">"Yes," he said. "Weren't ther Old Man talkin' ter yer, up on ther poop
this mornin'?"</p>

<p id="id01603" class="calibre1">"Yes," I answered. "He said something to the Second Mate about
shortening down; but it wasn't to me."</p>

<p id="id01604" class="calibre1">"They are!" said Quoin, "'aven't I just said so?"</p>

<p id="id01605" class="calibre1">At that instant, one of the chaps in the other watch, poked his head in
through the starboard doorway.</p>

<p id="id01606" class="calibre1">"All hands shorten sail!" he sung out; at the same moment the Mate's
whistle came sharp along the decks.</p>

<p id="id01607" class="calibre1">Plummer stood up, and reached for his cap.</p>

<p id="id01608" class="calibre1">"Well," he said. "It's evydent they ain't goin' ter lose no more of us!"</p>

<p id="id01609" class="calibre1">Then we went out on deck.</p>

<p id="id01610" class="calibre1">It was a dead calm; but all the same, we furled the three royals, and
then the three t'gallants. After that, we hauled up the main and
foresail, and stowed them. The crossjack, of course, had been furled
some time, with the wind being plumb aft.</p>

<p id="id01611" class="calibre1">It was while we were up at the foresail, that the sun went over the edge
of the horizon. We had finished stowing the sail, out upon the yard, and
I was waiting for the others to clear in, and let me get off the
foot-rope. Thus it happened that having nothing to do for nearly a
minute, I stood watching the sun set, and so saw something that
otherwise I should, most probably, have missed. The sun had dipped
nearly half-way below the horizon, and was showing like a great, red
dome of dull fire. Abruptly, far away on the starboard bow, a faint mist
drove up out of the sea. It spread across the face of the sun, so that
its light shone now as though it came through a dim haze of smoke.
Quickly, this mist or haze grew thicker; but, at the same time,
separating and taking strange shapes, so that the red of the sun struck
through ruddily between them. Then, as I watched, the weird mistiness
collected and shaped and rose into three towers. These became more
definite, and there was something elongated beneath them. The shaping
and forming continued, and almost suddenly I saw that the thing had
taken on the shape of a great ship. Directly afterwards, I saw that it
was moving. It had been broadside on to the sun. Now it was swinging.
The bows came round with a stately movement, until the three masts bore
in a line. It was heading directly towards us. It grew larger; but yet
less distinct. Astern of it, I saw now that the sun had sunk to a mere
line of light. Then, in the gathering dusk it seemed to me that the ship
was sinking back into the ocean. The sun went beneath the sea, and the
thing I had seen became merged, as it were, into the monotonous greyness
of the coming night.</p>

<p id="id01612" class="calibre1">A voice came to me from the rigging. It was the Second Mate's. He had
been up to give us a hand.</p>

<p id="id01613" class="calibre1">"Now then, Jessop," he was saying. "Come along! come along!"</p>

<p id="id01614" class="calibre1">I turned quickly, and realised that the fellows were nearly all off the
yard.</p>

<p id="id01615" class="calibre1">"i, i, Sir," I muttered, and slid in along the foot-rope, and went down
on deck. I felt fresh dazed and frightened.</p>

<p id="id01616" class="calibre1">A little later, eight bells went, and, after roll call, I cleared up, on
to the poop, to relieve the wheel. For a while as I stood at the wheel
my mind seemed blank, and incapable of receiving impressions. This
sensation went, after a time, and I realised that there was a great
stillness over the sea. There was absolutely no wind, and even the
everlasting creak, creak of the gear seemed to ease off at times.</p>

<p id="id01617" class="calibre1">At the wheel there was nothing whatever to do. I might just as well have
been forrard, smoking in the fo'cas'le. Down on the main-deck, I could
see the loom of the lanterns that had been lashed up to the sherpoles in
the fore and main rigging. Yet they showed less than they might, owing
to the fact that they had been shaded on their after sides, so as not to
blind the officer of the watch more than need be.</p>

<p id="id01618" class="calibre1">The night had come down strangely dark, and yet of the dark and the
stillness and the lanterns, I was only conscious in occasional flashes
of comprehension. For, now that my mind was working, I was thinking
chiefly of that queer, vast phantom of mist, I had seen rise from the
sea, and take shape.</p>

<p id="id01619" class="calibre1">I kept staring into the night, towards the West, and then all round me;
for, naturally, the memory predominated that she had been coming towards
us when the darkness came, and it was a pretty disquieting sort of thing
to think about. I had such a horrible feeling that something beastly was
going to happen any minute.</p>

<p id="id01620" class="calibre1">Yet, two bells came and went, and still all was quiet—strangely quiet,
it seemed to me. And, of course, besides the queer, misty vessel I had
seen in the West I was all the time remembering the four shadowy craft
lying down in the sea, under our port side. Every time I remembered
them, I felt thankful for the lanterns round the maindeck, and I
wondered why none had been put in the mizzen rigging. I wished to
goodness that they had, and made up my mind I would speak to the Second
Mate about it, next time he came aft. At the time, he was leaning over
the rail across the break of the poop. He was not smoking, as I could
tell; for had he been, I should have seen the glow of his pipe, now and
then. It was plain to me that he was uneasy. Three times already he had
been down on to the maindeck, prowling about. I guessed that he had been
to look down into the sea, for any signs of those four grim craft. I
wondered whether they would be visible at night.</p>

<p id="id01621" class="calibre1">Suddenly, the time-keeper struck three bells, and the deeper notes of
the bell forrard, answered them. I gave a start. It seemed to me that
they had been struck close to my elbow. There was something
unaccountably strange in the air that night. Then, even as the Second
Mate answered the look-out's "All's well," there came the sharp whir and
rattle of running gear, on the port side of the mainmast.
Simultaneously, there was the shrieking of a parrel, up the main; and I
knew that someone, or something, had let go the main-topsail haul-yards.
From aloft there came the sound of something parting; then the crash of
the yard as it ceased falling.</p>

<p id="id01622" class="calibre1">The Second Mate shouted out something unintelligible, and jumped for the
ladder. From the maindeck there came the sound of running feet, and the
voices of the watch, shouting. Then I caught the Skipper's voice; he
must have run out on deck, through the Saloon doorway.</p>

<p id="id01623" class="calibre1">"Get some more lamps! Get some more lamps!" he was singing out. Then he
swore.</p>

<p id="id01624" class="calibre1">He sung out something further. I caught the last two words.</p>

<p id="id01625" class="calibre1">"…carried away," they sounded like.</p>

<p id="id01626" class="calibre1">"No, Sir," shouted the Second Mate. "I don't think so."</p>

<p id="id01627" class="calibre1">A minute of some confusion followed; and then came the click of pawls. I
could tell that they had taken the haulyards to the after capstan. Odd
words floated up to me.</p>

<p id="id01628" class="calibre1">"…all this water?" I heard in the Old Man's voice. He appeared to be
asking a question.</p>

<p id="id01629" class="calibre1">"Can't say, Sir," came the Second Mate's.</p>

<p id="id01630" class="calibre1">There was a period of time, filled only by the clicking of the pawls and
the sounds of the creaking parrel and the running gear. Then the Second
Mate's voice came again.</p>

<p id="id01631" class="calibre1">"Seems all right, Sir," I heard him say.</p>

<p id="id01632" class="calibre1">I never heard the Old Man's reply; for in the same moment, there came to
me a chill of cold breath at my back. I turned sharply, and saw
something peering over the taffrail. It had eyes that reflected the
binnacle light, weirdly, with a frightful, tigerish gleam; but beyond
that, I could see nothing with any distinctness. For the moment, I just
stared. I seemed frozen. It was so close. Then movement came to me, and
I jumped to the binnacle and snatched out the lamp. I twitched round,
and shone the light towards it. The thing, whatever it was, had come
more forward over the rail; but now, before the light, it recoiled with
a queer, horrible litheness. It slid back, and down, and so out of
sight. I have only a confused notion of a wet glistening Something, and
two vile eyes. Then I was running, crazy, towards the break of the poop.
I sprang down the ladder, and missed my footing, and landed on my stern,
at the bottom. In my left hand I held the still burning binnacle lamp.
The men were putting away the capstan-bars; but at my abrupt appearance,
and the yell I gave out at falling, one or two of them fairly ran
backwards a short distance, in sheer funk, before they realised what it
was.</p>

<p id="id01633" class="calibre1">From somewhere further forrard, the Old Man and the Second Mate came
running aft.</p>

<p id="id01634" class="calibre1">"What the devil's up now?" sung out the Second, stopping and bending to
stare at me. "What's to do, that you're away from the wheel?"</p>

<p id="id01635" class="calibre1">I stood up and tried to answer him; but I was so shaken that I could
only stammer.</p>

<p id="id01636" class="calibre1">"I—I—there—" I stuttered.</p>

<p id="id01637" class="calibre1">"Damnation!" shouted the Second Mate, angrily. "Get back to the wheel!"</p>

<p id="id01638" class="calibre1">I hesitated, and tried to explain.</p>

<p id="id01639" class="calibre1">"Do you damned well hear me?" he sung out.</p>

<p id="id01640" class="calibre1">"Yes, Sir; but—" I began.</p>

<p id="id01641" class="calibre1">"Get up on to the poop, Jessop!" he said.</p>

<p id="id01642" class="calibre1">I went. I meant to explain, when he came up. At the top of the ladder, I
stopped. I was not going back alone to that wheel. Down below, I heard
the Old Man speaking.</p>

<p id="id01643" class="calibre1">"What on earth is it now, Mr. Tulipson?" he was saying.</p>

<p id="id01644" class="calibre1">The Second Mate made no immediate reply; but turned to the men, who were
evidently crowding near.</p>

<p id="id01645" class="calibre1">"That will do, men!" he said, somewhat sharply.</p>

<p id="id01646" class="calibre1">I heard the watch start to go forrard. There came a mutter of talk from
them. Then the Second Mate answered the Old Man. He could not have known
that I was near enough to overhear him.</p>

<p id="id01647" class="calibre1">"It's Jessop, Sir. He must have seen something; but we mustn't frighten
the crowd more than need be."</p>

<p id="id01648" class="calibre1">"No," said the Skipper's voice.</p>

<p id="id01649" class="calibre1">They turned and came up the ladder, and I ran back a few steps, as far
as the skylight. I heard the Old Man speak as they came up.</p>

<p id="id01650" class="calibre1">"How is it there are no lamps, Mr. Tulipson?" he said, in a surprised
tone.</p>

<p id="id01651" class="calibre1">"I thought there would be no need up here, Sir," the Second Mate
replied. Then he added something about saving oil.</p>

<p id="id01652" class="calibre1">"Better have them, I think," I heard the Skipper say.</p>

<p id="id01653" class="calibre1">"Very good, Sir," answered the Second, and sung out to the time-keeper
to bring up a couple of lamps.</p>

<p id="id01654" class="calibre1">Then the two of them walked aft, to where I stood by the skylight.</p>

<p id="id01655" class="calibre1">"What are you doing, away from the wheel?" asked the Old Man, in a stern
voice.</p>

<p id="id01656" class="calibre1">I had collected my wits somewhat by now.</p>

<p id="id01657" class="calibre1">"I won't go, Sir, till there's a light," I said.</p>

<p id="id01658" class="calibre1">The Skipper stamped his foot, angrily; but the Second Mate stepped
forward.</p>

<p id="id01659" class="calibre1">"Come! Come, Jessop!" he exclaimed. "This won't do, you know! You'd
better get back to the wheel without further bother."</p>

<p id="id01660" class="calibre1">"Wait a minute," said the Skipper, at this juncture. "What objection
have you to going back to the wheel?" he asked.</p>

<p id="id01661" class="calibre1">"I saw something," I said. "It was climbing over the taffrail, Sir—"</p>

<p id="id01662" class="calibre1">"Ah!" he said, interrupting me with a quick gesture. Then, abruptly:<br class="calibre10"/>

"Sit down! sit down; you're all in a shake, man."<br class="calibre10"/>
</p>

<p id="id01663" class="calibre1">I flopped down on to the skylight seat. I was, as he had said, all in a
shake, and the binnacle lamp was wobbling in my hand, so that the light
from it went dancing here and there across the deck.</p>

<p id="id01664" class="calibre1">"Now," he went on. "Just tell us what you saw."</p>

<p id="id01665" class="calibre1">I told them, at length, and while I was doing so, the time-keeper
brought up the lights and lashed one up on the sheerpole in each
rigging.</p>

<p id="id01666" class="calibre1">"Shove one under the spanker boom," the Old Man sung out, as the boy
finished lashing up the other two. "Be smart now."</p>

<p id="id01667" class="calibre1">"i, i, Sir," said the 'prentice, and hurried off.</p>

<p id="id01668" class="calibre1">"Now then," remarked the Skipper when this had been done "You needn't be
afraid to go back to the wheel. There's a light over the stern, and the
Second Mate or myself will be up here all the time."</p>

<p id="id01669" class="calibre1">I stood up.</p>

<p id="id01670" class="calibre1">"Thank you, Sir," I said, and went aft. I replaced my lamp in the
binnacle, and took hold of the wheel; yet, time and again, I glanced
behind and I was very thankful when, a few minutes later, four bells
went, and I was relieved.</p>

<p id="id01671" class="calibre1">Though the rest of the chaps were forrard in the fo'cas'le, I did not go
there. I shirked being questioned about my sudden appearance at the foot
of the poop ladder; and so I lit my pipe and wandered about the
maindeck. I did not feel particularly nervous, as there were now two
lanterns in each rigging, and a couple standing upon each of the spare
top-masts under the bulwarks.</p>

<p id="id01672" class="calibre1">Yet, a little after five bells, it seemed to me that I saw a shadowy
face peer over the rail, a little abaft the fore lanyards. I snatched up
one of the lanterns from off the spar, and flashed the light towards it,
whereupon there was nothing. Only, on my mind, more than my sight, I
fancy, a queer knowledge remained of wet, peery eyes. Afterwards, when I
thought about them, I felt extra beastly. I knew then how brutal they
had been … Inscrutable, you know. Once more in that same watch I had a
somewhat similar experience, only in this instance it had vanished even
before I had time to reach a light. And then came eight bells, and our
watch below.</p>

<div class="calibre4"></div><h2 id="id01673" class="calibre5">XV</h2>

<p id="id01674" class="calibre2"><i class="calibre7">The Great Ghost Ship</i></p>

<p id="id01675" class="calibre1">When we were called again, at a quarter to four, the man who roused us
out, had some queer information.</p>

<p id="id01676" class="calibre1">"Toppin's gone—clean vanished!" he told us, as we began to turn out. "I
never was in such a damned, hair-raisin' hooker as this here. It ain't
safe to go about the bloomin' decks."</p>

<p id="id01677" class="calibre1">"'oo's gone?" asked Plummer, sitting up suddenly and throwing his legs
over his bunk-board.</p>

<p id="id01678" class="calibre1">"Toppin, one of the 'prentices," replied the man. "We've been huntin'
all over the bloomin' show. We're still at it—but we'll never find
him," he ended, with a sort of gloomy assurance.</p>

<p id="id01679" class="calibre1">"Oh, I dunno," said Quoin. "P'raps 'e's snoozin' somewheres 'bout."</p>

<p id="id01680" class="calibre1">"Not him," replied the man. "I tell you we've turned everythin' upside
down. He's not aboard the bloomin' ship.</p>

<p id="id01681" class="calibre1">"Where was he when they last saw him?" I asked.</p>

<p id="id01682" class="calibre1">"Someone must know something, you know!"</p>

<p id="id01683" class="calibre1">"Keepin' time up on the poop," he replied. "The Old Man's nearly shook
the life out of the Mate and the chap at the wheel. And they say they
don't know nothin'."</p>

<p id="id01684" class="calibre1">"How do you mean?" I inquired. "How do you mean, nothing?"</p>

<p id="id01685" class="calibre1">"Well," he answered. "The youngster was there one minute, and then the
next thing they knew, he'd gone. They've both sworn black an' blue that
there wasn't a whisper. He's just disappeared off of the face of the
bloomin' earth."</p>

<p id="id01686" class="calibre1">I got down on to my chest, and reached for my boots.</p>

<p id="id01687" class="calibre1">Before I could speak again, the man was saying something fresh.</p>

<p id="id01688" class="calibre1">"See here, mates," he went on. "If things is goin' on like this, I'd
like to know where you an' me'll be befor' long!"</p>

<p id="id01689" class="calibre1">"We'll be in 'ell," said Plummer.</p>

<p id="id01690" class="calibre1">"I dunno as I like to think 'bout it," said Quoin.</p>

<p id="id01691" class="calibre1">"We'll have to think about it!" replied the man. "We've got to think a
bloomin' lot about it. I've talked to our side, an' they're game."</p>

<p id="id01692" class="calibre1">"Game for what?" I asked.</p>

<p id="id01693" class="calibre1">"To go an' talk straight to the bloomin' Capting," he said, wagging his
finger at me. "It's make tracks for the nearest bloomin' port, an' don't
you make no bloomin' mistake."</p>

<p id="id01694" class="calibre1">I opened my mouth to tell him that the probability was we should not be
able to make it, even if he could get the Old Man to see the matter from
his point of view. Then I remembered that the chap had no idea of the
things I had seen, and <i class="calibre7">thought out</i>; so, instead, I said:</p>

<p id="id01695" class="calibre1">"Supposing he won't?"</p>

<p id="id01696" class="calibre1">"Then we'll have to bloomin' well make him," he replied.</p>

<p id="id01697" class="calibre1">"And when you got there," I said. "What then? You'd be jolly well locked
up for mutiny."</p>

<p id="id01698" class="calibre1">"I'd sooner be locked up," he said. "It don't kill you!"</p>

<p id="id01699" class="calibre1">There was a murmur of agreement from the others, and then a moment of
silence, in which, I know, the men were thinking.</p>

<p id="id01700" class="calibre1">Jaskett's voice broke into it.</p>

<p id="id01701" class="calibre1">"I never thought at first as she was 'aunted—" he commenced; but<br class="calibre10"/>

Plummer cut in across his speech.<br class="calibre10"/>
</p>

<p id="id01702" class="calibre1">"We mustn't 'urt any one, yer know," he said. "That'd mean 'angin', an'
they ain't been er bad crowd.</p>

<p id="id01703" class="calibre1">"No," assented everyone, including the chap who had come to call us.</p>

<p id="id01704" class="calibre1">"All the same," he added. "It's got to be up hellum, an' shove her into
the nearest bloomin' port."</p>

<p id="id01705" class="calibre1">"Yes," said everyone, and then eight bells went, and we cleared out on
deck.</p>

<p id="id01706" class="calibre1">Presently, after roll-call—in which there had come a queer, awkward
little pause at Toppin's name—Tammy came over to me. The rest of the
men had gone forrard, and I guessed they were talking over mad plans for
forcing the Skipper's hand, and making him put into port—poor beggars!</p>

<p id="id01707" class="calibre1">I was leaning over the port rail, by the fore brace-lock, staring down
into the sea, when Tammy came to me. For perhaps a minute he said
nothing. When at last he spoke, it was to say that the shadow vessels
had not been there since daylight.</p>

<p id="id01708" class="calibre1">"What?" I said, in some surprise. "How do you know?"</p>

<p id="id01709" class="calibre1">"I woke up when they were searching for Toppin," he replied. "I've not
been asleep since. I came here, right away." He began to say something
further; but stopped short.</p>

<p id="id01710" class="calibre1">"Yes," I said encouragingly.</p>

<p id="id01711" class="calibre1">"I didn't know—" he began, and broke off. He caught my arm. "Oh,
Jessop!" he exclaimed. "What's going to be the end of it all? Surely
something can be done?"</p>

<p id="id01712" class="calibre1">I said nothing. I had a desperate feeling that there was very little we
could do to help ourselves.</p>

<p id="id01713" class="calibre1">"Can't we do something?" he asked, and shook my arm. "Anything's better
than <i class="calibre7">this</i>! We're being <i class="calibre7">murdered!"</i></p>

<p id="id01714" class="calibre1">Still, I said nothing; but stared moodily down into the water. I could
plan nothing; though I would get mad, feverish fits of thinking.</p>

<p id="id01715" class="calibre1">"Do you hear?" he said. He was almost crying.</p>

<p id="id01716" class="calibre1">"Yes, Tammy," I replied. "But I don't know! I <i class="calibre7">don't</i> know!"</p>

<p id="id01717" class="calibre1">"You don't know!" he exclaimed. "You don't know! Do you mean we're just
to give in, and be murdered, one after another?"</p>

<p id="id01718" class="calibre1">"We've done all we can," I replied. "I don't know what else we can do,
unless we go below and lock ourselves in, every night."</p>

<p id="id01719" class="calibre1">"That would be better than this," he said. "There'll be no one to go
below, or anything else, soon!"</p>

<p id="id01720" class="calibre1">"But what if it came on to blow?" I asked. "We'd be having the sticks
blown out of her."</p>

<p id="id01721" class="calibre1">"What if it came on to blow <i class="calibre7">now</i>?" he returned. "No one would go aloft,
if it were dark, you said, yourself! Besides, we could shorten her
<i class="calibre7">right</i> down, first. I tell you, in a few days there won't be a chap
alive aboard this packet unless they jolly well do something!"</p>

<p id="id01722" class="calibre1">"Don't shout," I warned him. "You'll have the Old Man hearing you." But
the young beggar was wound up, and would take no notice.</p>

<p id="id01723" class="calibre1">"I will shout," he replied. "I want the Old Man to hear. I've a good
mind to go up and tell him."</p>

<p id="id01724" class="calibre1">He started on a fresh tack.</p>

<p id="id01725" class="calibre1">"Why don't the men do something?" he began. "They ought to damn well
make the Old Man put us into port! They ought—"</p>

<p id="id01726" class="calibre1">"For goodness sake, shut up, you little fool!" I said. "What's the good
of talking a lot of damned rot like that? You'll be getting yourself
into trouble."</p>

<p id="id01727" class="calibre1">"I don't care," he replied. "I'm not going to be murdered!"</p>

<p id="id01728" class="calibre1">"Look here," I said. "I told you before, that we shouldn't be able to
see the land, even if we made it."</p>

<p id="id01729" class="calibre1">"You've no proof," he answered. "It's only your idea."</p>

<p id="id01730" class="calibre1">"Well," I replied. "Proof, or no proof, the Skipper would only pile her
up, if he tried to make the land, with things as they are now."</p>

<p id="id01731" class="calibre1">"Let him pile her up," he answered. "Let him jolly well pile her up!
That would be better than staying out here to be pulled overboard, or
chucked down from aloft!"</p>

<p id="id01732" class="calibre1">"Look here, Tammy—" I began; but just then the Second Mate sung out for
him, and he had to go. When he came back, I had started to walk to and
from, across the fore side of the mainmast. He joined me, and after a
minute, he started his wild talk again.</p>

<p id="id01733" class="calibre1">"Look here, Tammy," I said, once more. "It's no use your talking like
you've been doing. Things are as they are, and it's no one's fault, and
nobody can help it. If you want to talk sensibly, I'll listen; if not,
then go and gas to someone else."</p>

<p id="id01734" class="calibre1">With that, I returned to the port side, and got up on the spar, again,
intending to sit on the pinrail and have a bit of a talk with him.
Before sitting down I glanced over, into the sea. The action had been
almost mechanical; yet, after a few instants, I was in a state of the
most intense excitement, and without withdrawing my gaze, I reached out
and caught Tammy's arm to attract his attention.</p>

<p id="id01735" class="calibre1">"My God!" I muttered. "Look!"</p>

<p id="id01736" class="calibre1">"What is it?" he asked, and bent over the rail, beside me. And this
is what we saw: a little distance below the surface there lay a
pale-coloured, slightly-domed disc. It seemed only a few feet down.
Below it, we saw quite clearly, after a few moment's staring, the shadow
of a royal-yard, and, deeper, the gear and standing-rigging of a great
mast. Far down among the shadows I thought, presently, that I could make
out the immense, indefinite stretch of vast decks.</p>

<p id="id01737" class="calibre1">"My God!" whispered Tammy, and shut up. But presently, he gave out a
short exclamation, as though an idea had come to him; and got down off
the spar, and ran forrard on to the fo'cas'le head. He came running
back, after a short look into the sea, to tell me that there was the
truck of another great mast coming up there, a bit off the bow, to
within a few feet of the surface of the sea.</p>

<p id="id01738" class="calibre1">In the meantime, you know, I had been staring like mad down through the
water at the huge, shadowy mast just below me. I had traced out bit by
bit, until now I could clearly see the jackstay, running along the top
of the royal mast; and, you know, the royal itself was <i class="calibre7">set</i>.</p>

<p id="id01739" class="calibre1">But, you know, what was getting at me more than anything, was a feeling
that there was movement down in the water there, among the rigging. I
<i class="calibre7">thought</i> I could actually see, at times, things moving and glinting
faintly and rapidly to and fro in the gear. And once, I was practically
certain that something was on the royal-yard, moving in to the mast; as
though, you know, it might have come up the leech of the sail. And this
way, I got a beastly feeling that there were things swarming down there.</p>

<p id="id01740" class="calibre1">Unconsciously, I must have leant further and further out over the side,
staring; and suddenly—good Lord! how I yelled—I overbalanced. I made a
sweeping grab, and caught the fore brace, and with that, I was back in a
moment upon the spar. In the same second, almost, it seemed to me that
the surface of the water above the submerged truck was broken, and I am
sure <i class="calibre7">now,</i> I saw something a moment in the air against the ship's side
—a sort of shadow in the air; though I did not realise it at the time.
Anyway, the next instant, Tammy gave out an awful scream, and was head
downwards over the rail, in a second. I had an idea <i class="calibre7">then</i> that he was
jumping overboard. I collared him by the waist of his britchers, and one
knee, and then I had him down on the deck, and sat plump on him; for he
was struggling and shouting all the time, and I was so breathless and
shaken and gone to mush, I could not have trusted my hands to hold him.
You see, I never thought <i class="calibre7">then</i> it was anything but some influence at
work on him; and that he was trying to get loose to go over the side.
But I know <i class="calibre7">now</i> that I saw the shadow-man that had him. Only, at the
time, I was so mixed up, and with the one idea in my head, I was not
really able to notice anything, properly. But, afterwards, I
comprehended a bit (you can understand, can't you?) what I had seen at
the time without taking in.</p>

<p id="id01741" class="calibre1">And even now looking back, I know that the shadow was only like a
faint-seen greyness in the daylight, against the whiteness of the decks,
clinging against Tammy.</p>

<p id="id01742" class="calibre1">And there was I, all breathless and sweating, and quivery with my own
tumble, sitting on the little screeching beggar, and he fighting like a
mad thing; so that I thought I should never hold him.</p>

<p id="id01743" class="calibre1">And then I heard the Second Mate shouting and there came running feet
along the deck. Then many hands were pulling and hauling, to get me off
him.</p>

<p id="id01744" class="calibre1">"Bl—y cowyard!" sung out someone.</p>

<p id="id01745" class="calibre1">"Hold him! Hold him!" I shouted. "He'll be overboard!"</p>

<p id="id01746" class="calibre1">At that, they seemed to understand that I was not ill-treating the
youngster; for they stopped manhandling me, and allowed me to rise;
while two of them took hold of Tammy, and kept him safe.</p>

<p id="id01747" class="calibre1">"What's the matter with him?" the Second Mate was singing out. "What's
happened?"</p>

<p id="id01748" class="calibre1">"He's gone off his head, I think," I said.</p>

<p id="id01749" class="calibre1">"What?" asked the Second Mate. But before I could answer him, Tammy
ceased suddenly to struggle, and flopped down upon the deck.</p>

<p id="id01750" class="calibre1">"'e's fainted," said Plummer, with some sympathy. He looked at me, with
a puzzled, suspicious air. "What's 'appened? What's 'e been doin'?"</p>

<p id="id01751" class="calibre1">"Take him aft into the berth!" ordered the Second Mate, a bit abruptly.
It struck me that he wished to prevent questions. He must have tumbled
to the fact that we had seen something, about which it would be better
not to tell the crowd.</p>

<p id="id01752" class="calibre1">Plummer stooped to lift the boy.</p>

<p id="id01753" class="calibre1">"No," said the Second Mate. "Not you, Plummer. Jessop, you take him." He
turned to the rest of the men. "That will do," he told them and they
went forrard, muttering a little.</p>

<p id="id01754" class="calibre1">I lifted the boy, and carried him aft.</p>

<p id="id01755" class="calibre1">"No need to take him into the berth," said the Second Mate. "Put him
down on the after hatch. I've sent the other lad for some brandy."</p>

<p id="id01756" class="calibre1">Then the brandy came, we dosed Tammy and soon brought him round. He sat
up, with a somewhat dazed air. Otherwise, he seemed quiet and sane
enough.</p>

<p id="id01757" class="calibre1">"What's up?" he asked. He caught sight of the Second Mate. "Have I been
ill, Sir?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p id="id01758" class="calibre1">"You're right enough now, youngster," said the Second Mate. "You've been
a bit off. You'd better go and lie down for a bit."</p>

<p id="id01759" class="calibre1">"I'm all right now, Sir," replied Tammy. "I don't think—"</p>

<p id="id01760" class="calibre1">"You do as you're told!" interrupted the Second. "Don't always have to
be told twice! If I want you, I'll send for you."</p>

<p id="id01761" class="calibre1">Tammy stood up, and made his way, in rather an unsteady fashion, into
the berth. I fancy he was glad enough to lie down.</p>

<p id="id01762" class="calibre1">"Now then, Jessop," exclaimed the Second Mate, turning to me. "What's
been the cause of all this? Out with it now, smart!"</p>

<p id="id01763" class="calibre1">I commenced to tell him; but, almost directly, he put up his hand.</p>

<p id="id01764" class="calibre1">"Hold on a minute," he said. "There's the breeze!"</p>

<p id="id01765" class="calibre1">He jumped up the port ladder, and sung out to the chap at the wheel.<br class="calibre10"/>

Then down again.<br class="calibre10"/>
</p>

<p id="id01766" class="calibre1">"Starboard fore brace," he sung out. He turned to me. "You'll have to
finish telling me afterwards," he said.</p>

<p id="id01767" class="calibre1">"i, i, Sir," I replied, and went to join the other chaps at the braces.</p>

<p id="id01768" class="calibre1">As soon as we were braced sharp up on the port tack, he sent some of the
watch up to loose the sails. Then he sung out for me.</p>

<p id="id01769" class="calibre1">"Go on with your yarn now, Jessop," he said.</p>

<p id="id01770" class="calibre1">I told him about the great shadow vessel, and I said something about
Tammy—I mean about my not being sure <i class="calibre7">now</i> whether he <i class="calibre7">had</i> tried to
jump overboard. Because, you see, I began to realise that I had seen the
shadow; and I remembered the stirring of the water above the submerged
truck. But the Second did not wait, of course, for any theories, but was
away, like a shot, to see for himself. He ran to the side, and looked
down. I followed, and stood beside him; yet, now that the surface of the
water was blurred by the wind, we could see nothing.</p>

<p id="id01771" class="calibre1">"It's no good," he remarked, after a minute. "You'd better get away from
the rail before any of the others see you. Just be taking those halyards
aft to the capstan."</p>

<p id="id01772" class="calibre1">From then, until eight bells, we were hard at work getting the sail upon
her, and when at last eight bells went, I made haste to swallow my
breakfast, and get a sleep.</p>

<p id="id01773" class="calibre1">At midday, when we went on deck for the afternoon watch, I ran to the
side; but there was no sign of the great shadow ship. All that watch,
the Second Mate kept me working at my paunch mat, and Tammy he put on to
his sinnet, telling me to keep an eye on the youngster. But the boy was
right enough; as I scarcely doubted now, you know; though—a most
unusual thing—he hardly opened his lips the whole afternoon. Then at
four o'clock, we went below for tea.</p>

<p id="id01774" class="calibre1">At four bells, when we came on deck again, I found that the light
breeze, which had kept us going during the day, had dropped, and we were
only just moving. The sun was low down, and the sky clear. Once or
twice, as I glanced across to the horizon, it seemed to me that I caught
again that odd quiver in the air that had preceded the coming of the
mist; and, indeed on two separate occasions, I saw a thin whisp of haze
drive up, apparently out of the sea. This was at some little distance on
our port beam; otherwise, all was quiet and peaceful; and though I
stared into the water, I could make out no vestige of that great shadow
ship, down in the sea.</p>

<p id="id01775" class="calibre1">It was some little time after six bells that the order came for all
hands to shorten sail for the night. We took in the royals and
t'gallants, and then the three courses. It was shortly after this, that
a rumour went round the ship that there was to be no look-out that night
after eight o'clock. This naturally created a good deal of talk among
the men; especially as the yarn went that the fo'cas'le doors were to be
shut and fastened as soon as it was dark, and that no one was to be
allowed on deck.</p>

<p id="id01776" class="calibre1">"'oo's goin' ter take ther wheel?" I heard Plummer ask.</p>

<p id="id01777" class="calibre1">"I s'pose they'll 'ave us take 'em as usual," replied one of the men.
"One of ther officers is bound ter be on ther poop; so we'll 'ave
company."</p>

<p id="id01778" class="calibre1">Apart from these remarks, there was a general opinion that—if it were
true—it was a sensible act on the part of the Skipper. As one of the
men said:</p>

<p id="id01779" class="calibre1">"It ain't likely that there'll be any of us missin' in ther mornin', if
we stays in our bunks all ther blessed night."</p>

<p id="id01780" class="calibre1">And soon after this, eight bells went.</p>

<div class="calibre4"></div><h2 id="id01781" class="calibre5">XVI</h2>

<p id="id01782" class="calibre2"><i class="calibre7">The Ghost Pirates</i></p>

<p id="id01783" class="calibre2">At the moment when eight bells actually went, I was in the fo'cas'le,
talking to four of the other watch. Suddenly, away aft, I heard
shouting, and then on the deck overhead, came the loud thudding of
someone pomping with a capstan-bar. Straightway, I turned and made a run
for the port doorway, along with the four other men. We rushed out
through the doorway on to the deck. It was getting dusk; but that did
not hide from me a terrible and extraordinary sight. All along the port
rail there was a queer, undulating greyness, that moved downwards
inboard, and spread over the decks. As I looked, I found that I saw more
clearly, in a most extraordinary way. And, suddenly, all the moving
greyness resolved into hundreds of strange men. In the half-light, they
looked unreal and impossible, as though there had come upon us the
inhabitants of some fantastic dream-world. My God! I thought I was mad.
They swarmed in upon us in a great wave of murderous, living shadows.
From some of the men who must have been going aft for roll-call, there
rose into the evening air a loud, awful shouting.</p>

<p id="id01784" class="calibre1">"Aloft!" yelled someone; but, as I looked aloft, I saw that the horrible
things were swarming there in scores and scores.</p>

<p id="id01785" class="calibre1">"Jesus Christ—!" shrieked a man's voice, cut short, and my glance
dropped from aloft, to find two of the men who had come out from the
fo'cas'le with me, rolling upon the deck. They were two
indistinguishable masses that writhed here and there across the planks.
The brutes fairly covered them. From them, came muffled little shrieks
and gasps; and there I stood, and with me were the other two men. A man
darted past us into the fo'cas'le, with two grey men on his back, and I
heard them kill him. The two men by me, ran suddenly across the fore
hatch, and up the starboard ladder on to the fo'cas'le head. Yet, almost
in the same instant, I saw several of the grey men disappear up the
other ladder. From the fo'cas'le head above, I heard the two men
commence to shout, and this died away into a loud scuffling. At that, I
turned to see whether I could get away. I stared round, hopelessly; and
then with two jumps, I was on the pigsty, and from there upon the top of
the deckhouse. I threw myself flat, and waited, breathlessly.</p>

<p id="id01786" class="calibre1">All at once, it seemed to me that it was darker than it had been the
previous moment, and I raised my head, very cautiously. I saw that the
ship was enveloped in great billows of mist, and then, not six feet from
me, I made out someone lying, face downwards. It was Tammy. I felt safer
now that we were hidden by the mist, and I crawled to him. He gave a
quick gasp of terror when I touched him; but when he saw who it was, he
started to sob like a little kid.</p>

<p id="id01787" class="calibre1">"Hush!" I said. "For God's sake be quiet!" But I need not have troubled;
for the shrieks of the men being killed, down on the decks all around
us, drowned every other sound.</p>

<p id="id01788" class="calibre1">I knelt up, and glanced round and then aloft. Overhead, I could make out
dimly the spars and sails, and now as I looked, I saw that the
t'gallants and royals had been unloosed and were hanging in the
buntlines. Almost in the same moment, the terrible crying of the poor
beggars about the decks, ceased; and there succeeded an awful silence,
in which I could distinctly hear Tammy sobbing. I reached out, and shook
him.</p>

<p id="id01789" class="calibre1">"Be quiet! Be quiet!" I whispered, intensely. "THEY'LL hear us!"</p>

<p id="id01790" class="calibre1">At my touch and whisper, he struggled to become silent; and then,
overhead, I saw the six yards being swiftly mast-headed. Scarcely were
the sails set, when I heard the swish and flick of gaskets being cast
adrift on the lower yards, and realised that ghostly things were at work
there.</p>

<p id="id01791" class="calibre1">For a moment or so there was silence, and I made my way cautiously to
the after end of the house, and peered over. Yet, because of the mist, I
could see nothing. Then, abruptly, from behind me, came a single wail of
sudden pain and terror from Tammy. It ended instantly in a sort of
choke. I stood up in the mist and ran back to where I had left the kid;
but he had gone. I stood dazed. I felt like shrieking out loud. Above me
I heard the flaps of the course being tumbled off the yards. Down upon
the decks, there were the noises of a multitude working in a weird,
inhuman silence. Then came the squeal and rattle of blocks and braces
aloft. They were squaring the yards.</p>

<p id="id01792" class="calibre1">I remained standing. I watched the yards squared, and then I saw the
sails fill suddenly. An instant later, the deck of the house upon which
I stood, became canted forrard. The slope increased, so that I could
scarcely stand, and I grabbed at one of the wire-winches. I wondered, in
a stunned sort of way, what was happening. Almost directly afterwards,
from the deck on the port side of the house, there came a sudden, loud,
human scream; and immediately, from different parts of the decks, there
rose, afresh, some most horrible shouts of agony from odd men. This grew
into an intense screaming that shook my heart up; and there came again a
noise of desperate, brief fighting. Then a breath of cold wind seemed to
play in the mist, and I could see down the slope of the deck. I looked
below me, towards the bows. The jibboom was plunged right into the
water, and, as I stared, the bows disappeared into the sea. The deck of
the house became a wall to me, and I was swinging from the winch, which
was now above my head. I watched the ocean lap over the edge of the
fo'cas'le head, and rush down on to the maindeck, roaring into the empty
fo'cas'le. And still all around me came crying of the lost sailor-men. I
heard something strike the corner of the house above me, with a dull
thud, and then I saw Plummer plunge down into the flood beneath. I
remembered that he had been at the wheel. The next instant, the water
had leapt to my feet; there came a drear chorus of bubbling screams, a
roar of waters, and I was going swiftly down into the darkness. I let go
of the winch, and struck out madly, trying to hold my breath. There was
a loud singing in my ears. It grew louder. I opened my mouth. I felt I
was dying. And then, thank God! I was at the surface, breathing. For the
moment, I was blinded with the water, and my agony of breathlessness.
Then, growing easier, I brushed the water from my eyes and so, not three
hundred yards away, I made out a large ship, floating almost motionless.
At first, I could scarcely believe I saw aright. Then, as I realised
that indeed there was yet a chance of living, I started to swim towards
you.</p>

<p id="id01793" class="calibre1">You know the rest——</p>

<p id="id01794" class="calibre1">"And you think—?" said the Captain, interrogatively, and stopped short.</p>

<p id="id01795" class="calibre1">"No," replied Jessop. "I don't think. I _know. None of us <i class="calibre7">think</i>. It's
a gospel fact. People <i class="calibre7">talk</i> about queer things happening at sea; but
this isn't one of them. This is one of the <i class="calibre7">real</i> things. You've all
seen queer things; perhaps more than I have. It depends. But they don't
go down in the log. These kinds of things never do. This one won't; at
least, not as it's really happened."</p>

<p id="id01796" class="calibre1">He nodded his head, slowly, and went on, addressing the Captain more
particularly.</p>

<p id="id01797" class="calibre1">"I'll bet," he said, deliberately, "that you'll enter it in the
log-book, something like this:</p>

<p id="id01798" class="calibre1">"'May l8th. Lat.—S. Long.—W. 2 p.m. Light winds from the South and
East. Sighted a full-rigged ship on the starboard bow. Overhauled her in
the first dog-watch. Signalled her; but received no response. During the
second dog-watch she steadily refused to communicate. About eight bells,
it was observed that she seemed to be settling by the head, and a minute
later she foundered suddenly, bows foremost, with all her crew. Put out
a boat and picked up one of the men, an A.B. by the name of Jessop. He
was quite unable to give any explanation of the catastrophe.'</p>

<p id="id01799" class="calibre1">"And you two," he made a gesture at the First and Second Mates, "will
probably sign your names to it, and so will I, and perhaps one of your
A.B.s. Then when we get home they'll print a report of it in the
newspapers, and people will talk about the unseaworthy ships. Maybe some
of the experts will talk rot about rivets and defective plates and so
forth."</p>

<p id="id01800" class="calibre1">He laughed, cynically. Then he went on.</p>

<p id="id01801" class="calibre1">"And you know, when you come to think of it, there's no one except our
own selves will ever know how it happened—really. The shellbacks don't
count. They're only 'beastly, drunken brutes of <i class="calibre7">common sailors</i>'—poor
devils! No one would think of taking anything they said, as anything
more than a damned cuffer. Besides, the beggars only tell these things
when they're half-boozed. They wouldn't then (for fear of being laughed
at), only they're not responsible—"</p>

<p id="id01802" class="calibre1">He broke off, and looked round at us.</p>

<p id="id01803" class="calibre1">The Skipper and the two Mates nodded their heads, in silent assent.</p>

<div class="calibre4"></div><h2 id="id01804" class="calibre5">APPENDIX</h2>

<p id="id01805" class="calibre2"><i class="calibre7">The Silent Ship</i></p>

<p id="id01806" class="calibre2">I'm the Third Mate of the <i class="calibre7">Sangier</i>, the vessel that picked up Jessop,
you know; and he's asked us to write a short note of what we saw from
our side, and sign it. The Old Man's set me on the job, as he says I can
put it better than he can.</p>

<p id="id01807" class="calibre1">Well, it was in the first dog-watch that we came up with her, the
<i class="calibre7">Mortzestus</i> I mean; but it was in the second dog-watch that it
happened. The Mate and I were on the poop watching her. You see, we'd
signalled her, and she'd not taken any notice, and that seemed queer, as
we couldn't have been more than three or four hundred yards off her port
beam, and it was a fine evening; so that we could almost have had a
tea-fight, if they'd seemed a pleasant crowd. As it was, we called them
a set of sulky swine, and left it at that, though we still kept our
hoist up.</p>

<p id="id01808" class="calibre1">All the same, you know, we watched her a lot; and I remember even then I
thought it queer how quiet she was. We couldn't even hear her bell go
and I spoke to the Mate about it, and he said he'd been noticing the
same thing.</p>

<p id="id01809" class="calibre1">Then, about six bells they shortened her right down to top-sails; and I
can tell you that made us stare more than ever, as anyone can imagine.
And I remember we noticed then especially that we couldn't hear a single
sound from her even when the haul yards were let go; and, you know,
without the glass, I saw their Old Man singing out something; but we
didn't get a sound of it and we <i class="calibre7">should</i> have been able to hear every
word.</p>

<p id="id01810" class="calibre1">Then, just before eight bells, the thing Jessop's told us about
happened. Both the Mate and the Old Man said they could see men going up
her side a bit indistinct, you know, because it was getting dusk; but
the Second Mate and I half thought we did and half thought we didn't;
but there was something queer; we all knew that; and it looked like a
sort of moving mist along her side. I know I felt pretty funny; but it
wasn't the sort of thing, of course, to be too sure and serious about
until you <i class="calibre7">were</i> sure.</p>

<p id="id01811" class="calibre1">After the Mate and the Captain had said they saw the men boarding her,
we began to hear sounds from her; very queer at first and rather like a
phonograph makes when it's getting up speed. Then the sounds came
properly from her, and we heard them shouting and yelling; and, you
know, I don't know even now just what I really thought. I was all so
queer and mixed.</p>

<p id="id01812" class="calibre1">The next thing I remember there was a thick mist round the ship; and
then all the noise was shut off, as if it were all the other side of a
door. But we could still see her masts and spars and sails above the
misty stuff; and both the Captain and the Mate said they could see men
aloft; and I thought I could; but the Second Mate wasn't sure. All the
same though, the sails were all loosed in about a minute, it seemed, and
the yards mastheaded. We couldn't see the courses above the mist; but
Jessop says they were loosed too and sheeted home along with the upper
sails. Then we saw the yards squared and I saw the sails fill bang up
with wind; and yet, you know, ours were slatting.</p>

<p id="id01813" class="calibre1">The next thing was the one that hit me more than anything. Her masts
took a cant forrard, and then I saw her stem come up out of the mist
that was round her. Then, all in an instant, we could hear sounds from
the vessel again. And I tell you, the men didn't seem to be shouting,
but screaming. Her stern went higher. It was most extraordinary to look
at; and then she went plunk down, head foremost, right bang into the
mist-stuff.</p>

<p id="id01814" class="calibre1">It's all right what Jessop says, and when we saw him swimming (I was the
one who spotted him) we got out a boat quicker than a wind-jammer ever
got out a boat before, I should think.</p>

<p id="id01815" class="calibre2">The Captain and the Mate and the Second and I are
all going to sign this.</p>
