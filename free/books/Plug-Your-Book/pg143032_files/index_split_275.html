<h1 id="wwwbooksensecom-gives-independent-bookstores-a-way-to-have-an-internet-shopping-site-without-making-big-technology-investments-its-the-e-commerce-arm-of-the-american-booksellers-associations-booksense-program" class="calibre2">www.BookSense.com# gives independent bookstores a way to have an Internet shopping site without making big technology investments. It's the e-commerce arm of the American Booksellers Association's BookSense program.</h1>
<p class="calibre1">BookSense uses the wholesaler Ingram Book's iPage database to provide book listings for its 475 participating stores. Fulfillment is handled by the store or Ingram.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If your book is available through Ingram, it should be available on participating BookSense store sites, said Mark Nichols, BookSense director of marketing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For books not available through Ingram, publishers can add a title to BookSense's database as long as it has a valid ISBN. Send your title, ISBN, author, publisher, bibliographic data, and cover art to #AddaBook@Booksense.com#.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Paid placement is also available through BookSense, which operates a co-op reimbursement program to help its members defray the costs of Web sites. BookSense handles the paperwork of aggregating offers from publishers who want to have their titles featured on BookSense sites for at least one month. Stores who accept the co-op offer must order at least five copies of the promoted title, unless the publisher specifies a higher minimum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The co-op program provides for face-out display of physical copies of the book in the store, display on the store's Web site, and sales reporting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A different BookSense program enables publishers to get reading copies of their books into the hands of local independent booksellers through its "Advanced Access Program." Several times a month, BookSense e-mails more than 1,000 booksellers, listing advance readers or finished books offered for review by publishers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Booksellers who see your review copy have the option of carrying your title and nominating it for the BookSense "Picks" list of recommended books.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Advanced Access participants can expect to receive e-mails from 25 to 50 booksellers who want to review your book. No specific results are guaranteed from the program, but it is a tool for publicizing your title to people who can provide word-of-mouth advertising in their communities. To enroll, send an e-mail to Peter Reynolds at #peter@booksense.com#. Indicate the title, author, publisher, ISBN, subject category, publication date, and the number of free copies you have to offer. Include a two-sentence book description and an e-mail address where booksellers can request their review copy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Include all your enrollment information in one paragraph that can be easily inserted in a larger message to bookstores. Here's an example:</p>
<hr class="calibre6"/>
<p class="calibre1">TITLE ABC by John Doe, (Publisher XXX, ISBN: 0-000-00000-0, $19.95, hardcover, September 2007, Mystery/Thriller). A two-sentence description goes here, maximum 50 words. XX number of Advance Reading Copies available.</p>
<p class="calibre1">mailto:yournamehere@ emailaddress.com</p>
<hr class="calibre6"/>
<p class="calibre1">Don't include Web site information, press releases, or cover art. It can take two to three weeks from the time you send your message until booksellers see it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">BookSense charges $100 per title, with discounts available for members of the Publishers Marketing Association. You can send a check payable to American Booksellers Association at: ABA, 200 White Plains Road, Tarrytown, NY 10591 ATTN: Sadie Evans. For information on how to pay with a credit card, send an e-mail to #sadie@bookweb.org#. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When you send review copies to BookSense members, enclose a thank you note and a reminder to "e-mail or write Dan Cullen #(Dan@Booksense.com#) if you like it."</p>
<p class="calibre1">More information about BookSense is available by sending an e-mail to # Staff@Booksense.com#. </p>
<p class="calibre1">#Ethics of online marketing#  </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps nothing is more important to authors and publishers than their reputation. While it's perfectly fine to promote your work energetically, consider the way your promotion might appear to others. Sometimes there's a fine line between being aggressive and being overzealous.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In some cases, the boundaries are clear. For example, the CAN-SPAM Act outlawed unsolicited commercial e-mail, so it's inappropriate to market your book by sending e-mails to strangers. In other cases, you'll need to use your judgment. For example, one section of this book discusses how to persuade people to review your book on Amazon. But don't ask people who haven't read your book. And don't review your book yourself. Don't buy thousands of copies of your own book in a ploy to push it onto the bestseller list.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the Internet, it's fairly easy to hide your identity, but often it comes back to haunt people who use it as a marketing technique.  </p>

    <li>
      <a href="index_split_106.html">www.glenngreenwald. blogspot.com.# Passions run high on political blogs, and the field is a rich training ground for authors. Glenn Greenwald, a constitutional law attorney who started the blog Unclaimed Territory in 2005, was recruited just eight months later to write How Would a Patriot Act? Thanks to exposure on Greenwald's blog and seven others, the book made it to Amazon's No. 1 spot and the New York Times bestseller list before it was even in print. Like many blog-to-book successes, this one was grass-roots--it wasn't promoted in review publications like Publishers Weekly or _ Kirkus Reviews _and was ignored by mainstream print and television media.</a>

      <a href="index_split_108.html">www.Wilwheaton.typepad.com.# Wil Wheaton is a former child star best known for his role in the 1986 film Stand By Me and his boyhood run on Star Trek: The Next Generation. After a 1990s lull, Wheaton reinvented his career by blogging, then self-publishing. His first book, _ Dancing Barefoot_, expanded on his autobiographical blog posts. After it quickly sold 3,000 copies, Wheaton signed a three-book deal with O'Reilly &amp; Associates Inc., the computer book publisher.</a>

      <a href="index_split_109.html">www.CBftw.blogspot.com. # Another popular book drawn from blog posts of a young amateur writer is My War: Killing Time in Iraq.

But Buzzell continued writing, and Putnam published an acclaimed book based on the blog in October 2005.</a>

      <a href="index_split_111.html">www.Poundy.com. # Children's book editor Wendy McClure started an online journal about her new diet.

McClure followed up in 2006 with The Amazing Mackerel Pudding Plan.</a>

      <a href="index_split_113.html">Mystery# #www.Hackoff.com.# Tom Evslin, a former executive with Microsoft and AT&amp;T, started this blog to serialize his first book, hackoff.com: An Historic Murder Mystery Set in the Internet Bubble and Rubble. Each passage from the book was published on the blog as Evslin wrote it, automatically building an audience for the book. He self-published the story in 2006 as a 642-page hardcover, supporting it with a book tour and Amazon Connect blog, where he publicized each tour appearance.</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="index_split_114.html">www.DailyPundit.com. # Longtime fiction writer William Quick used his popular political blog as a launch platform for a self-published novel. After five years of trying to sell his conspiracy novel Inner Circles to a trade publisher, Quick posted it on his blog in e-book form in September 2005. Within weeks, he sold more than 900 copies at $5 apiece, raking in $4,500. Blog visitors still buy about 100 copies of the book per month.</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="index_split_117.html">www.FonerBooks.com/ cornered.htm. # Morris Rosenthal got started in self-publishing in the 1990s by posting some ideas for a computer book on his Web site. Word spread quickly, and by simply answering one question from a reader each day, Rosenthal attracted a big following and sales of his book took off. That led to this blog and a related book about self-publishing, _ Print-On-Demand Book Publishing_.</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="index_split_127.html">Benefits, not features. # For nonfiction, briefly describe the benefits--what problems does it solve? Explain how your book differs from competing titles. If you've received a truly impressive blurb or endorsement, include it.</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="index_split_140.html">Agents and publishers.# Book publishers want to find authors who already have a following, a platform that can be turned into readership and book buyers. One obvious way of showing you have a platform is by making a name for yourself on MySpace.</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="index_split_143.html">Search.# Click Search on the top toolbar on the MySpace home page. You can limit your search to certain areas such as Books Interest, Blogs, Music Interest, or others. Let's imagine you're looking for MySpace members interested in organic food. Click on Search, Book Interest, and enter "organic food." Presto, you've got a list of every MySpace member who's used the words "organic food" in their profile. Use the same search technique to find subjects, genres and author names. Also, use the # Affiliations for Networking# search tool a bit farther down the page. You can search the fields "Marketing" or "Publishing" using your keywords to find potential MySpace friends who could share book-marketing resources and tips.</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="index_split_144.html">Browse for friends. # If you have a travel book or title of regional interest, it might be useful to browse for potential MySpace friends by geographic area. On the home page, click Browse and the #Advanced# tab. You'll be able to view member profiles within a specified distance of postal ZIP codes, as well as other criteria such as age, gender, religion, and income. Many single MySpace members use this function to scout potential dates, but it can be useful for entrepreneurs as well.</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="index_split_145.html">Sending friends requests. # Once you find a potential friend, click Add to Friends under their main photo on the left. And if you want to increase the odds of making a real connection, don't stop there--send a personalized message by clicking the Send a Message link. It requires some extra work, but you can't convert people into book buyers simply by pecking on your mouse button.</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="index_split_147.html">Sending bulletins. #Once you've built a network of MySpace friends, the ability to send MySpace bulletins is a powerful tool. Your message won't be e-mailed like your personal messages are, but its headline will appear on all your friends' home pages in the box labeled My Bulletin Space. Whether you have two dozen MySpace friends or 20,000, the ability to let them all know about your new book at the same time is a unique tool.</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="index_split_150.html">Headline. # When you set up your MySpace account, you're able to upload a picture--perhaps your portrait or book cover--and a short message labeled your #headline#. Use this space to identify yourself: who you are, and what you write about. Use this to its maximum effect. Add your book title or a brief description of the type of books you write.

    <li>
      <a href="index_split_153.html">Photos. # Many authors use their book cover as their main photo on MySpace instead of a portrait. In any case, use professional photos and artwork when possible. Hire a real photographer or enlist a talented friend with a digital camera. Don't brand yourself an amateur by using a crummy snapshot.</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="index_split_160.html">Try to keep your MySpace pages streamlined and clutter-free.# Make sure that anyone who sees it can easily discover your book and, if interested, buy it quickly. Put "buy this book" links so they'll appear on each page.</a>

    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="index_split_166.html">Remember books you're considering buying.# If one of your tagged books is intended for a Christmas gift, you can tag the book "Xmas" or "present"--tags that aren't very useful to others. Tags like "real best picture of 2004" are better.</a>
    </li>
    <li>
