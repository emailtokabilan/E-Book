<p class="calibre1">"I	always	thought	that	you,	Pegler,	were	such	a	very	sensible	woman." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 words	 were	 said	 in	 a	 good-natured,	 though	 slightly	 vexed	 tone;	 and	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">curious	kind	of	smile	flitted	over	the	rather	grim	face	of	the	person	to	whom	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	addressed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've	never	troubled	you	before	in	this	exact	way,	have	I,	ma'am?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	Pegler.	That	you	certainly	have	not." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	 Farrow	 looked	 up	 from	 the	 very	 comfortable	 armchair	 where	 she	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">sitting—leaning	back,	with	her	neatly	shod,	beautifully	shaped	feet	stretched	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 log	 fire.	 Her	 maid	 was	 standing	 a	 little	 to	 the	 right,	 her	 spare	 figure	 and sallow	face	lit	up	by	the	flickering,	shooting	flames,	for	the	reading-lamp	at	Miss</p>
<p class="calibre1">Farrow's	elbow	was	heavily	shaded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"D'you	really	mean	that	you	won't	sleep	next	door	to-night,	Pegler?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	wouldn't	be	fit	to	do	my	work	to-morrow	if	I	did,	ma'am."	And	Miss	Farrow quite	 understood	 that	 that	 was	 Pegler's	 polite	 way	 of	 saying	 that	 she	 most definitely	did	refuse	to	sleep	in	the	room	next	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	wish	the	ghost	had	come	in	here,	instead	of	worrying	you!"	As	the	maid	made no	 answer	 to	 this	 observation,	 her	 mistress	 went	 on,	 turning	 round	 so	 that	 she could	look	up	into	the	woman's	face:	"What	was	it	exactly	you	 <i class="calibre4">did</i>	see,	Pegler?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 as	 the	 other	 still	 remained	 silent,	 Miss	 Farrow	 added:	 "I	 really	 do	 want	 to know!	 You	 see,	 Pegler—well,	 I	 need	 hardly	 tell	 you	 that	 I	 have	 a	 very	 great opinion	of	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then,	 to	 the	 speaker's	 extreme	 surprise,	 there	 came	 a	 sudden	 change	 over Pegler's	 face.	 Her	 pale	 countenance	 flushed,	 it	 became	 discomposed,	 and	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned	her	head	away	to	hide	the	springing	tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	 Farrow	 was	 touched;	 as	 much	 touched	 as	 her	 rather	 hard	 nature	 would</p>
<p class="calibre1">allow	 her	 to	 be.	 This	 woman	 had	 been	 her	 good	 and	 faithful	 friend,	 as	 well	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a>servant,	for	over	twelve	years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sprang	up	from	her	deep	chair	with	the	lightness	of	a	girl,	though	she	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	forty;	and	went	and	took	the	other's	hand.	"Pegler!"	she	exclaimed.	"What's the	matter,	you	dear	old	thing?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Pegler	wrenched	away	her	hand,	rather	ungraciously.	"After	two	such	nights</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	I've	had,"	she	muttered,	"it's	no	wonder	I'm	a	bit	upset." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Excellent	 maid	 though	 she	 was—Miss	 Farrow	 had	 never	 known	 anyone	 who</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 do	 hair	 as	 Pegler	 could—the	 woman	 was	 in	 some	 ways	 very</p>
<p class="calibre1">unconventional,	very	unlike	an	ordinary	lady's	maid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now	do	tell	me	exactly	what	happened?"	Miss	Farrow	spoke	with	a	mixture	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">coaxing	 and	 kindly	 authority.	 "What	 do	 you	 think	 you	 saw?	 I	 need	 hardly	 tell you	 that	  <i class="calibre4">I</i>	 don't	 believe	 in	 ghosts."	 As	 the	 maid	 well	 knew,	 the	 speaker	 might have	finished	the	sentence	with	"or	in	anything	else."	But	that	fact,	Pegler	being the	manner	of	woman	she	was,	did	not	detract	from	the	affection	and	esteem	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	 she	 held	 her	 lady.	 You	 can't	 have	 everything—such	 was	 her	 simple</p>
<p class="calibre1">philosophy—and	religious	people	do	not	always	act	up	to	their	profession.	Miss</p>
<p class="calibre1">Farrow,	at	any	rate	in	her	dealings	with	Pegler,	was	always	better	than	her	word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	a	kind,	a	considerate,	and	an	intelligent	mistress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	 it	 was	 that,	 reluctantly,	 Pegler	 made	 up	 her	 mind	 to	 speak.	 "I'd	 like	 to	 say, ma'am,"	 she	 began,	 "that	 no	 one	 said	 nothing	 to	 me	 about	 that	 room	 being haunted.	 You	 was	 the	 first	 that	 mentioned	 it	 to	 me,	 after	 I'd	 spoken	 to	 you yesterday.	As	you	know,	ma'am,	the	servants	here	are	a	job	lot;	they	don't	know</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing	 about	 the	 house.	 'Twasn't	 till	 to-day	 that	 one	 of	 the	 village	 people,	 the woman	 at	 the	 general	 shop	 and	 post	 office,	 let	 on	 that	 Wyndfell	 Hall	 was	 well known	to	be	a	ghosty	place." </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	pause,	and	then	Pegler	added:	"Still,	as	you	and	I	well	know,	ma'am, </p>
<p class="calibre1">tales	don't	lose	nothing	in	the	telling." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Indeed	they	don't!	Never	mind	what	the	people	in	the	village	say.	This	kind	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">strange,	lonely,	beautiful	old	house	is	sure	to	be	said	to	be	haunted.	What	 <i class="calibre4">I</i>	want to	know	is	what	 <i class="calibre4">you</i>	think	you	saw,	Pegler—"	The	speaker	looked	sharply	into the	woman's	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 don't	 like	 to	 see	 you	 standing,	 ma'am,"	 said	 Pegler	 inconsequently.	 "If	 you'll sit	down	in	your	chair	again	I'll	tell	you	what	happened	to	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>Miss	Farrow	sank	 gracefully	down	into	 her	deep,	comfortable	 chair.	Again	she put	out	her	feet	to	the	fire,	for	it	was	very	cold	on	this	23rd	of	December,	and	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew	she	had	a	tiring,	probably	a	boring,	evening	before	her.	Some	strangers	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">whom	she	knew	nothing,	and	cared	less,	excepting	that	they	were	the	friends	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 friend	 and	 host,	 Lionel	 Varick,	 were	 to	 arrive	 at	 Wyndfell	 Hall	 in	 time	 for dinner.	It	was	now	six	o'clock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,"	she	said	patiently,	"begin	at	the	beginning,	Pegler.	I	wish	you'd	sit	down too—somehow	it	worries	me	to	see	you	standing	there.	You'll	be	tempted	to	cut</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	story	short." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pegler	smiled	a	thin	little	smile.	In	the	last	twelve	years	Miss	Farrow	had	several</p>
<p class="calibre1">times	 invited	 her	 to	 sit	 down,	 but	 of	 course	 she	 had	 always	 refused,	 being	 one that	knew	her	place.	She	had	only	sat	in	Miss	Farrow's	presence	during	the	days</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	nights	when	she	had	nursed	her	mistress	through	a	serious	illness—then,	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">course,	everything	had	been	different,	and	she	had	had	to	sit	down	sometimes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	day	before	yesterday—that	is	the	evening	Miss	Bubbles	arrived,	ma'am—</p>
<p class="calibre1">after	 I'd	 dressed	 you	 and	 you'd	 gone	 downstairs,	 and	 I'd	 unpacked	 for	 Miss Bubbles,	I	went	into	my	room	and	thought	how	pleasant	it	looked.	The	curtains</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	drawn,	and	there	was	a	nice	fire,	as	you	know,	ma'am,	which	Mr.	Varick	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">kindly	ordered	for	me,	and	which	I've	had	the	whole	week.	Also,	I	will	say	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Annie	that	even	if	she	is	a	temporary,	she	is	a	good	housemaid,	making	the	girls</p>
<p class="calibre1">under	her	do	their	work	properly." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pegler	drew	a	long	breath.	Then	she	went	on	again:	"I	sat	down	just	for	a	minute</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	 two,	 and	 I	 turned	 over	 queer—so	 queer,	 ma'am,	 that	 I	 went	 and	 drew	 the curtains	 of	 one	 of	 the	 windows.	 Of	 course	 it's	 a	 much	 bigger	 room	 than	 I'm generally	 accustomed	 to	 occupy,	 as	 you	 know,	 ma'am.	 And	 I	 just	 threw	 up	 the window—it's	what	they	call	a	guillotine	window—and	there	I	saw	the	water,	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">know,	ma'am,	in	what	they	call	the	moat—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,"	said	Miss	Farrow	languidly.	"Yes,	Pegler,	go	on." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As	 I	 looked	 down,	 ma'am,	 I	 had	 an	 awful	 turn.	 There	 seemed	 to	 me	 to	 be something	floating	about	in	the	water,	a	little	narrow	thing	like	a	child's	body—</p>
<p class="calibre1">and—and	all	on	a	sudden	a	small	white	face	seemed	to	look	up	into	mine!	Oh,	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 'orrible!"	 Pegler	 did	 not	 often	 drop	 an	 aitch,	 but	 when	 she	 did	 so	 forget herself,	she	did	it	thoroughly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As	 I	 went	 on	 looking,	 fascinated-like"—she	 was	 speaking	 very	 slowly	 now</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>—"whatever	 was	 down	 there	 seemed	 to	 melt	 away.	 I	 didn't	 say	 nothing	 that evening	of	what	had	happened	to	me,	but	I	couldn't	keep	myself	from	thinking	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">it.	Well,	then,	ma'am,	as	you	know,	I	came	and	undressed	you,	and	I	asked	you	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">you'd	like	the	door	kept	open	between	our	two	rooms.	But	you	said	no,	ma'am, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you'd	rather	it	was	shut.	So	then	I	went	to	bed." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	 you	 say—you	 admit,	 Pegler—that	 nothing	  <i class="calibre4">did</i>	 happen	 the	 night	 before last?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pegler	 hesitated.	 "Nothing	 happened	 exactly,"	 she	 said.	 "But	 I	 had	 the	 most awful	feeling,	ma'am.	And	yes—well,	something	did	happen!	I	heard	a	kind	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">rustling	in	the	room.	It	would	leave	off	for	a	time,	and,	then	begin	again.	I	tried</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	put	it	down	to	a	mouse	or	a	rat—or	something	of	that	sort." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That,"	said	Miss	Farrow	quietly,	"was	probably	what	it	was,	Pegler." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	if	she	had	not	heard	her	lady's	remark,	the	maid	went	on:	"I'd	go	off	to	sleep, and	 then	 suddenly,	 I'd	 awake	 and	 hear	 this	 peculiar	 rustle,	 ma'am,	 like	 a	 dress swishing	along—an	old-fashioned,	rich,	soft	silk,	such	as	ladies	wore	in	the	old</p>
<p class="calibre1">days,	when	I	was	a	child.	But	that	dress,	the	dress	I	heard	rustling,	ma'am,	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bit	older	than	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	 <i class="calibre4">do</i>	you	mean,	Pegler?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 maid	 remained	 silent,	 her	 eyes	 were	 fixed;	 it	 was	 as	 if	 she	 had	 forgotten where	she	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	what	exactly	happened	last	night?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Last	night,"	said	Pegler,	drawing	a	long	breath,	"last	night,	ma'am—I	know	you won't	believe	me—but	I	saw	the	spirit!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Farrow	looked	up	into	the	woman's	face	with	an	anxious,	searching	glance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	felt	disturbed	and	worried.	A	great	deal	of	her	material	comfort—almost,	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">might	have	truly	said,	much	of	her	happiness	in	life—depended	on	Jane	Pegler. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 a	 sense	 Blanche	 Farrow	 had	 but	 two	 close	 friends	 in	 the	 world—her	 host, Lionel	 Varick,	 the	 new	 owner	 of	 Wyndfell	 Hall;	 and	 the	 plain,	 spare,	 elderly woman	standing	now	before	her.	She	realized	with	a	sharp	pang	of	concern	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pegler's	 mental	 defection	 would	 mean	 to	 her.	 It	 would	 be	 dreadful,  <i class="calibre4">dreadful</i>,	 if Pegler	began	seeing	ghosts,	and	turning	hysterical. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>"What	was	the	spirit	like?"	she	asked	quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then,	 all	 at	 once,	 she	 had	 to	 suppress	 a	 violent	 inclination	 to	 burst	 out laughing.	 For	 Pegler	 answered	 with	 a	 kind	 of	 cry,	 "A	 'orrible	 happarition, ma'am!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Farrow	could	not	help	observing	a	trifle	satirically:	"That	certainly	sounds most	unpleasant." </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Pegler	went	on,	speaking	with	a	touch	of	excitement	very	unusual	with	her:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	 was	 a	 woman—a	 woman	 with	 a	 dreadful,	 wicked,	 spiteful	 face!	 Once	 she came	up	close	to	my	bed,	and	I	wanted	to	scream	out,	but	I	couldn't—my	throat</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	shut	up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"D'you	mean	you	actually	saw	what	you	took	to	be	a	ghost?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	did	see	a	ghost,	ma'am;	not	a	doubt	of	it!	She	walked	up	and	down	that	room</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 there,	 wringing	 her	 hands	 all	 the	 time—I'd	 heard	 the	 expression,	 ma'am,	 but I'd	never	seen	anyone	do	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did	anything	else	happen?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"At	last	she	went	over	to	the	window,	and—and	I'm	afraid	you	won't	believe	me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">ma'am—but	 there	 seemed	 no	 curtains	 there	 any	 more,	 nothing	 but	 just	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">opening	into	the	darkness.	I	saw	her	bend	over—"	An	expression	of	terror	came</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	the	woman's	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	how	could	you	 <i class="calibre4">see</i>	her,"	asked	Miss	Farrow	quickly,	"if	there	was	no	light in	the	room?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In	a	sort	of	way,"	said	Pegler	somberly,	"the	spirit	was	supplying	the	light,	as	it were.	I	could	see	her	in	the	darkness,	as	if	she	was	a	lamp	moving	about." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	Pegler,	Pegler!"	exclaimed	Miss	Farrow	deprecatingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	true,	ma'am!	It's	true	as	I'm	standing	here."	Pegler	would	have	liked	to	add the	words	"So	help	me	God!"	but	somehow	she	felt	that	these	words	would	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">carry	 any	 added	 conviction	 to	 her	 mistress.	 And,	 indeed,	 they	 would	 not	 have done	so,	for	Miss	Farrow,	though	she	was	much	too	polite	and	too	well-bred	ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	have	said	so,	even	to	herself,	did	not	believe	in	a	Supreme	Being.	She	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">complete	materialist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	then,	ma'am,	after	a	bit,	there	it	would	begin,	constant-like,	all	over	again." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>"I	don't	understand...." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'd	 go	 to	 sleep,	 and	 tell	 myself	 maybe	 that	 it	 was	 all	 a	 dream—argue	 with myself,	ma'am,	for	I'm	a	sensible	woman.	And	then	all	at	once	I'd	hear	that	rustle</p>
<p class="calibre1">again!	 I'd	 try	 not	 to	 open	 my	 eyes,	 but	 somehow	 I	 felt	 I	 must	 see	 what	 was happening.	 So	 I'd	 look	 at	 last—and	 there	 she'd	 be!	 Walking	 up	 and	 down, </p>
<p class="calibre1">walking	up	and	down,	her	face—oh,	ma'am,	her	face	staring-like	most	'orrible—</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 wringing	 her	 hands.	 Then	 she'd	 go	 over	 to	 the	 window,	 lean	 out,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappear,	down	into	the	black	water!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 a	 calmer	 tone	 Pegler	 added:	 "The	 moat	 used	 to	 be	 much	 bigger	 and	 deeper than	it	is	now,	ma'am—so	they	all	say." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All?"	said	Miss	Farrow	sharply.	"Who	do	you	mean	by	'all'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	people	about	the	place,	ma'am." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 can't	 help	 wishing,	 Pegler,	 that	 you	 hadn't	 told	 this	 strange	 story	 to	 the servants.	You	see	it	makes	it	so	awkward	for	Mr.	Varick." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pegler	 flushed	 uncomfortably.	 "I	 was	 that	 scared,"	 she	 murmured,	 "that	 I	 felt	 I must	tell	somebody,	and	if	you	tell	one,	as	I	did,	you	tell	all.	I'm	sorry	I	did	it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">ma'am,	for	I'm	afraid	I've	inconvenienced	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	 can't	 be	 helped,"	 said	 Miss	 Farrow	 good-naturedly.	 "I	 know	 you	 wouldn't have	 done	 it	 if	 you	 could	 have	 helped	 it,	 Pegler.	 But	 of	 course	 in	 a	 way	 it's unlucky." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've	pointed	out	to	them	all	that	there	never	is	but	one	room	haunted	in	a	house as	 a	 rule,"	 said	 the	 maid	 eagerly,	 "and	 I	 think	 they	 all	 quite	 sees	 that,	 ma'am. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Besides,	 they're	 very	 pleased	 with	 Mr.	 Varick.	 You	 know	 what	 he	 did	 to-day, ma'am?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	said	Miss	Farrow,	looking	up	and	smiling,	"what	did	he	do?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	called	them	all	together,	without	distinction	of	class,	so	to	speak,	ma'am,	and he	 told	 them	 that	 if	 he	 was	 pleased	 with	 the	 way	 in	 which	 his	 Christmas	 party went	off,	he'd	give	them	each	a	five-pound	note	at	the	end	of	the	month.	It	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	 forget	 the	 haunted	 room,	 I	 can	 tell	 you,	 ma'am!"	 She	 added	 grudgingly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	 <i class="calibre4">is</i>	a	kind	gentleman,	and	no	mistake." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Indeed	he	is!	I'm	glad	that	you	see	that	now,	Pegler."	Miss	Farrow	spoke	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>touch	of	meaning	in	her	voice.	"I	did	a	very	good	turn	for	myself	when	I	got	him out	of	that	queer	scrape	years	ago." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why	yes,	ma'am,	I	suppose	you	did."	But	Pegler's	tone	was	not	as	hearty	as	that of	her	lady. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	pause.	"Then	what	have	you	settled	to	do	about	to-night?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	you	don't	mind,	ma'am—I'm	arranging	to	sleep	in	what	they	call	the	second</p>
<p class="calibre1">maid's	room.	There	is	a	bell	through,	ma'am,	but	you'll	have	to	go	into	the	next</p>
<p class="calibre1">room	to	ring	it,	for	you	know,	ma'am,	that	it's	the	next	room	that	ought	to	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	your	room	by	rights." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	wish	now	that	I'd	taken	it	and	put	you	in	here,"	said	Miss	Farrow	ruefully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They're	going	to	keep	up	a	good	fire	there.	So	when	you	go	in	you	won't	get	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">chill." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	does	seem	luxurious,"	said	Miss	Farrow,	smiling.	She	loved	luxury,	and	it was	pleasant	to	think	that	there	should	be	a	fire	kept	up	in	an	empty	room	just	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 she	 shouldn't	 feel	 a	 chill	 when	 she	 went	 in	 for	 a	 moment	 to	 ring	 for	 her maid! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"By	 the	 way,	 I	 hope	 there's	 a	 fireplace	 in	 your	 room,	 Pegler"—the	 words	 were uttered	solicitously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	there	isn't,	ma'am.	But	I	don't	mind	that.	I	don't	much	care	about	a	fire." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There's	no	accounting	for	taste!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Farrow	took	up	her	book	again,	and	Pegler,	as	was	her	way,	slid	noiselessly</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	room—not	through	the	door	leading	into	the	haunted	chamber,	but	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 to	 the	 beautiful	 panelled	 landing,	 now	 gay	 with	 bowls	 of	 hothouse	 flowers which	had	come	down	from	London	that	morning	by	passenger	train,	and	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">brought	by	car	all	the	way	from	Newmarket. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	II</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	book	Miss	Farrow	held	in	her	hand	was	an	amusing	book,	the	latest	volume</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 some	 rather	 lively	 French	 memoirs,	 but	 she	 put	 it	 down	 after	 a	 very	 few moments,	 and,	 leaning	 forward,	 held	 out	 her	 hands	 to	 the	 fire.	 They	 were	 not pretty	 hands:	 though	 small	 and	 well-shaped,	 there	 was	 something	 just	 a	 little claw-like	 about	 them;	 but	 they	 were	 very	 white,	 and	 her	 almond-shaped	 nails, admirably	manicured,	gleamed	in	the	soft	red	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes,	 in	 spite	 of	 this	 stupid	 little	  <i class="calibre4">contretemps</i>	 about	 Pegler,	 she	 was	 glad	 indeed that	circumstances	over	which	she	had	had	rather	more	control	than	she	liked	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">think	 had	 made	 it	 impossible	 for	 her	 to	 go	 out	 to	 Monte	 Carlo	 this	 winter.	 She had	 been	 sharply	 vexed,	 beside	 herself	 with	 annoyance,	 almost	 tempted	 to	 do what	she	had	never	yet	done—that	is,	to	ask	Lionel	Varick,	now	so	delightfully</p>
<p class="calibre1">prosperous,	 to	 lend	 her	 a	 couple	 of	 hundred	 pounds.	 But	 she	 had	 resisted	 the impulse,	and	she	was	now	glad	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 all,	 there's	 no	 place	 like	 dear	 old	 England	 at	 Christmas	 time.	 How	 much nicer,	too,	is	a	bachelor	host	than	a	hostess!	A	bachelor	host?	No,	not	exactly	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bachelor	 host,	 for	 Lionel	 Varick	 was	 a	 widower.	 Twice	 a	 widower,	 if	 the	 truth were	 known.	 But	 the	 truth,	 fortunately,	 is	 not	 always	 known,	 and	 Blanche</p>
<p class="calibre1">Farrow	doubted	if	any	other	member	of	the	circle	of	friends	and	acquaintances</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 had	 picked	 up	 in	 his	 adventurous,	 curious	 life	 knew	 of	 that	 first—now</p>
<p class="calibre1">evidently	by	him	almost	forgotten—marriage.	It	had	taken	place	years	ago,	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	was	still	a	very	young	man,	and	to	a	woman	not	of	his	own	class.	They</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 separated,	 and	 then,	 rather	 oddly,	 come	 together	 again.	 Even	 so,	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">premature	death	had	been	for	him	a	fortunate	circumstance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 not	 Varick	 who	 had	 told	 Blanche	 Farrow	 of	 that	 painful	 episode	 of	 his past	life.	The	story	had	come	to	her	knowledge	in	a	curious,	accidental	fashion, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	she	had	thought	it	only	fair	to	tell	him	what	she	had	learned—and	then,	half</p>
<p class="calibre1">reluctantly,	he	had	revealed	something	of	what	he	had	suffered	through	that	early</p>
<p class="calibre1">act	of	folly.	But	they	had	only	spoken	of	it	once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick's	 second	 marriage,	 Miss	 Farrow	 was	 almost	 tempted	 to	 call	 it	 his	 real marriage,	 the	 news	 of	 which	 he	 had	 conveyed	 to	 his	 good	 friend	 in	 a	 laconic</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>note,	had	surprised	her	very	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 news	 had	 found	 her	 far	 away,	 in	 Portugal,	 where,	 as	 just	 a	 few	 English people	 know,	 there	 is	 more	 than	 one	 Casino	 where	 mild	 gambling	 can	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">pursued	 under	 pleasant	 conditions.	 Blanche	 Farrow	 would	 have	 been	 hurt	 if</p>
<p class="calibre1">someone	had	told	her	that	in	far-away	Portugal	Lionel	Varick	and	his	affairs	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	meant	quite	so	much	to	her	as	they	would	have	done	if	she	had	been	nearer</p>
<p class="calibre1">home.	 Still,	 she	 had	 felt	 a	 pang.	 A	 man-friend	 married	 is	 often	 a	 man-friend marred.	 But	 she	 had	 been	 very	 glad	 to	 gather,	 reading	 between	 the	 lines	 of	 his note,	 that	 the	 lady	 in	 question	 was	 well	 off.	 Varick	 was	 one	 of	 those	 men	 to whom	the	possession	of	money	is	as	essential	to	life	as	the	air	they	breathe	is	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">most	 human	 beings.	 Till	 this	 unexpected	 second	 marriage	 of	 his	 he	 had	 often been	obliged	to	live	on,	and	by,	his	wits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	 some	 months	 later—for	 she	 and	 Varick	 were	 not	 given	 to	 writing	 to	 one another	 when	 apart,	 their	 friendship	 had	 never	 been	 of	 that	 texture—she	 had received	 a	 sad	 letter	 from	 him	 saying	 that	 his	 wife	 was	 seriously	 ill.	 The	 letter had	implied,	too,	that	he	ought	to	have	been	told,	before	the	marriage	had	taken</p>
<p class="calibre1">place,	that	his	wife's	family	had	been	one	riddled	with	consumption.	Blanche	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">written	 back	 at	 once—by	 that	 time	 she	 was	 a	 good	 deal	 nearer	 home	 than</p>
<p class="calibre1">Portugal,	 though	 still	 abroad—asking	 if	 she	 could	 "do	 anything?"	 And	 he	 had answered	 that	 no,	 there	 was	 nothing	 to	 be	 done.	 "Poor	 Milly"	 had	 a	 horror	 of sanatoriums,	so	he	was	going	to	take	her	to	some	quiet	place	on	the	south	coast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	ended	his	note	with	the	words:	"I	do	not	think	it	can	last	long	now,	and	I rather	hope	it	won't.	It	is	very	painful	for	her,	as	well	as	for	me."	And	it	had	not lasted	very	long.	Seven	weeks	later	Miss	Farrow	had	read	in	the	first	column	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	  <i class="calibre4">Times</i>	 the	 announcement:	 "Millicent,	 only	 daughter	 of	 the	 late	 George Fauncey,	of	Wyndfell	Hall,	Suffolk,	and	the	beloved	wife	of	Lionel	Varick." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had	been	surprised	at	the	addition	of	the	word	"beloved."	Somehow	it	was not	like	the	man	she	thought	she	knew	so	well	to	put	that	word	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	just	over	a	year	ago.	But	when	she	had	met	Varick	again	she	had	seen</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	real	relief	that	he	was	quite	unchanged—those	brief	months	of	wedded	life</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	not	apparently	altered	him	at	all.	There	was,	however,	one	great	difference—</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 was	 quite	 at	 ease	 about	 money.	 That	 was	 all—but	 that	 was	 a	 great	 deal! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	Farrow	and	Lionel	Varick	had	at	any	rate	one	thing	in	common—they</p>
<p class="calibre1">both	felt	a	horror	of	poverty,	and	all	that	poverty	implies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gradually	Miss	Farrow	had	discovered	a	few	particulars	about	her	friend's	dead</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>wife.	 Millicent	 Fauncey	 had	 been	 the	 only	 child	 of	 a	 rather	 eccentric	 Suffolk squire,	a	man	of	great	taste,	known	in	the	art	world	of	London	as	a	collector	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">fine	 Jacobean	 furniture,	 long	 before	 Jacobean	 furniture	 had	 become	 the	 rage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 her	 father's	 death	 his	 daughter,	 having	 let	 Wyndfell	 Hall,	 had	 wandered about	the	world	with	a	companion	till	she	had	drifted	across	her	future	husband's</p>
<p class="calibre1">path	at	an	hotel	in	Florence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	attracted	me,"	Lionel	Varick	had	explained	rather	awkwardly	on	the	only occasion	when	he	had	really	talked	of	his	late	wife	to	Blanche	Farrow,	"was	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">helplessness,	and,	yes,	a	kind	of	simplicity." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	had	looked	at	him	a	little	sharply.	She	had	never	known	Lionel	attracted</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	weakness	or	simplicity	before.	All	women	seemed	attracted	by	him—but	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	by	no	means	attracted	by	all	women. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Poor	Milly	didn't	care	for	Wyndfell	Hall,"	he	had	gone	on,	"for	she	spent	a	very lonely,	dull	girlhood	there.	But	it's	a	delightful	place,	and	I	hope	to	live	there	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">soon	as	I	can	get	the	people	out	to	whom	it	is	now	let.	'Twon't	be	an	easy	job,	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">they're	devoted	to	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	course	he	had	got	them	out	very	soon,	for,	as	Blanche	Farrow	now	reminded</p>
<p class="calibre1">herself,	 Lionel	 Varick	 had	 an	 extraordinary	 power	 of	 getting	 his	 own	 way,	 in little	and	big	things	alike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 uncommonly	 nice	 of	 Lionel	 to	 have	 asked	 her	 to	 be	 informal	 hostess	 of his	first	house	party!	Unluckily	it	was	an	oddly	composed	party,	not	so	happily</p>
<p class="calibre1">chosen	as	it	might	have	been,	and	she	wondered	uneasily	whether	it	would	be	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">success.	 She	 had	 never	 met	 three	 of	 the	 people	 who	 were	 coming	 to-night—a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	 and	 Miss	 Burnaby,	 an	 old-fashioned	 and,	 she	 gathered,	 well-to-do	 brother and	sister,	and	their	niece,	Helen	Brabazon.	Miss	Brabazon	had	been	an	intimate</p>
<p class="calibre1">friend,	Miss	Farrow	understood	the	only	really	intimate	friend,	of	Lionel	Varick's</p>
<p class="calibre1">late	 wife.	 He	 had	 spoken	 of	 this	 girl,	 Helen	 Brabazon,	 with	 great	 regard	 and liking—with	 rather	 more	 regard	 and	 liking	 than	 he	 generally	 spoke	 of	 any</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	 was	 most	 awfully	 kind	 to	 me	 during	 that	 dreadful	 time	 at	 Redsands,"	 he had	 said	 only	 yesterday.	 And	 Blanche	 had	 understood	 the	 "dreadful	 time" </p>
<p class="calibre1">referred	to	the	last	weeks	of	his	wife's	life.	"I've	been	to	the	Burnabys'	house	a few	 times,	 and	 I've	 dined	 there	 twice—an	 infamously	 bad	 cook,	 but	 very	 good wine—you	know	the	sort	of	thing?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>Remembering	that	remark,	Blanche	now	asked	herself	why	Lionel	had	included these	 tiresome,	 old-fashioned	 people	 in	 his	 party.	 Then	 she	 told	 herself	 that	 it was	doubtless	because	the	niece,	who	lived	with	them,	couldn't	leave	them	to	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">solitary	Christmas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	guest	who	was	not	likely	to	add	much	in	the	way	of	entertainment	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">party	was	an	enormously	rich	man	called	James	Tapster.	Tapster	was	a	cynical, </p>
<p class="calibre1">rather	 unpleasant	 person,	 yet	 on	 one	 occasion	 he	 had	 helped	 Varick	 out	 of	 a disagreeable	scrape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	the	host	had	had	his	way	there	would	also	have	been	in	the	party	a	certain	Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Panton.	 But	 at	 the	 last	 moment	 he	 had	 had	 to	 "chuck."	 There	 was	 a	 hope, however,	 that	 he	 might	 be	 able	 to	 come	 after	 Christmas.	 Dr.	 Panton	 was	 also associated	 with	 the	 late	 Mrs.	 Varick.	 He	 had	 attended	 her	 during	 the	 last	 long weeks	of	her	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	 Farrow's	 face	 unconsciously	 brightened	 as	 she	 remembered	 Sir	 Lyon</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dilsford.	He	was	an	intelligent,	impecunious,	pleasant	kind	of	man,	still,	like	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">host,	on	the	sunny	side	of	forty.	Sir	Lyon	was	"in	the	City,"	as	are	now	so	many men	of	his	class	and	kind.	He	took	his	work	seriously,	and	spent	many	hours	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">each	day	east	of	Temple	Bar.	By	way	of	relaxation	he	helped	to	run	an	Oxford</p>
<p class="calibre1">College	 East-End	 Settlement.	 "A	 good	 chap,"—that	 was	 how	 Blanche	 summed him	up	to	herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lionel	had	asked	her	if	she	could	think	of	any	young	people	to	ask,	and	she	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">suggested,	with	some	hesitation,	her	own	niece,	Bubbles	Dunster,	and	Bubbles' </p>
<p class="calibre1">favourite	 dancing	 partner,	 a	 young	 man	 called	 Bill	 Donnington.	 Bubbles	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrived	 at	 Wyndfell	 Hall	 two	 days	 ago.	 Donnington	 had	 not	 been	 able	 to	 leave London	till	to-day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles?	 Blanche	 Farrow's	 brows	 knit	 themselves	 as	 she	 thought	 of	 her	 niece, namesake,	and	godchild. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	was	a	strange	girl,	but	then	so	many	girls	are	strange	nowadays!	Though</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	 only	 child,	 and	 the	 apple	 of	 her	 widowed	 father's	 eyes,	 she	 had	 deliberately left	her	home	two	years	ago,	and	set	up	for	herself	in	London,	nominally	to	study</p>
<p class="calibre1">art.	 At	 once	 she	 had	 become	 a	 great	 success—the	 kind	 of	 success	 that	 counts nowadays.	 Bubbles'	 photograph	 was	 always	 appearing	 in	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Sketch</i>	 and	 in	 the <i class="calibre4">Daily	Mirror</i>.	She	was	constantly	roped	in	to	help	in	any	smart	charity	affair,	and she	could	dance,	act,	and	sell,	with	the	best.	She	was	as	popular	with	women	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 men,	 for	 there	 was	 something	 disarming,	 attaching,	 almost	 elfish,	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>Bubbles	Dunster's	charm.	For	one	thing,	she	was	so	good-natured,	so	kindly,	so always	eager	to	do	someone	a	good	turn—and	last,	not	least,	she	had	inherited</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	aunt's	cleverness	about	clothes!	She	dressed	in	a	way	which	Blanche	Farrow</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought	ridiculously	 <i class="calibre4">outré</i>	and	queer,	but	still,	somehow,	she	always	looked	well-dressed.	And	though	she	had	never	been	taught	dressmaking,	she	could	make	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">own	 clothes	 when	 put	 to	 it,	 and	 was	 always	 willing	 to	 help	 other	 people	 with theirs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hugh	Dunster,	Bubbles'	father,	did	not	often	favour	his	sister-in-law	with	a	letter, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 she	 had	 had	 a	 letter	 from	 him	 three	 days	 ago,	 of	 which	 the	 most	 important passage	ran:	"I	understand	that	Bubbles	is	going	to	spend	Christmas	with	you.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wish	 you'd	 say	 a	 word	 to	 her	 about	 all	 this	 spiritualistic	 rot.	 She	 seems	 to	 be getting	 deeper	 and	 deeper	 into	 it.	 It's	 impairing	 her	 looks,	 making	 her	 nervous and	almost	hysterical—in	a	word,	quite	unlike	herself.	I	spoke	to	her	some	time</p>
<p class="calibre1">ago,	and	desired	her	most	earnestly	to	desist	from	it.	But	a	father	has	no	power</p>
<p class="calibre1">nowadays!	 I	 have	 talked	 the	 matter	 over	 with	 young	 Donnington	 (of	 whom	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">sometimes	suspect	she	is	fonder	than	she	knows),	and	he	quite	agrees	with	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 all,	 she's	 a	 child	 still,	 and	 doesn't	 realize	 what	  <i class="calibre4">vieux	 jeu</i>	 all	 that	 sort	 of thing	 is.	 I	 insisted	 on	 reading	 to	 her	 'Sludge,	 the	 Medium,'	 but	 it	 made	 no impression	 on	 her!	 In	 a	 sense	 I've	 only	 myself	 to	 thank,	 for	 I	 used	 to	 amuse myself	in	testing	her	amazing	thought-reading	powers	when	she	was	a	little	girl." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	had	now	been	at	Wyndfell	Hall	two	whole	days,	and	so	far	her	aunt	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	 nothing	 to	 her.	 Somehow	 she	 felt	 a	 certain	 shyness	 of	 approaching	 the subject.	 In	 so	 far	 as	 she	 had	 ever	 thought	 about	 it—and	 she	 had	 never	 really thought	about	it	at	all—Miss	Farrow	regarded	all	that	she	knew	of	spiritualism</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 a	 gigantic	 fraud.	 It	 annoyed	 her	 fastidiousness	 to	 think	 that	 her	 own	 niece should	 be	 in	 any	 way	 associated	 with	 that	 kind	 of	 thing.	 She	 realized	 the temptation	it	must	offer	to	a	clever	girl	who,	as	her	father	truly	said,	had	had	as	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">child	an	uncanny	power	of	thought-reading,	and	of	"willing"	people	to	do	what she	liked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	Farrow	smiled	and	sighed	as	she	stared	into	the	fire.	How	the	world	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">changed!	 She	 could	 not	 imagine	 her	 own	 father,	 though	 he	 had	 been	 far	 less conventional	than	was	Hugh	Dunster,	talking	her	over	with	a	young	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poor	Bill	Donnington!	Of	course	he	was	devoted	to	Bubbles—her	slave,	in	fact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	had	only	seen	him	once;	she	had	thought	him	sensible,	undistinguished, </p>
<p class="calibre1">commonplace.	She	knew	that	he	was	the	third	or	fourth	son	of	a	worthy	North-</p>
<p class="calibre1">country	 parson—in	 other	 words,	 he	 "hadn't	 a	 bob."	 He	 was,	 of	 course,	 the	 last</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>man	 Bubbles	 would	 ever	 think	 of	 marrying.	 Bubbles,	 like	 most	 of	 her	 set,	 was keenly	alive	to	the	value	of	money.	Bubbles,	as	likely	as	not,	would	make	a	set, </p>
<p class="calibre1">half	in	fun,	half	in	earnest,	at	James	Tapster! </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	tell	the	truth,	Miss	Farrow	had	not	forgotten	Bubbles	when	she	had	assented</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 Lionel	 Varick's	 suggestion	 that	 rich,	 if	 dull-witted,	 James	 Tapster	 should	 be included	in	the	party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 what	 was	 called	 the	 moat	 garden	 of	 Wyndfell	 Hall,	 twilight	 was	 deepening into	night.	But	Lionel	Varick,	who	was	now	pacing	up	and	down	the	broad	path</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	followed	the	course	of	the	moat,	could	still	see,	sharply	outlined	against</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 pale	 winter	 sky,	 the	 vision	 of	 tranquil	 beauty	 and	 the	 storehouse	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">archaeological	and	antiquarian	interest	which	was	now	his	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	his	special	orders	the	windows	had	been	left	uncurtained.	There	were	lights</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 a	 great	 number	 of	 the	 rooms—indeed,	 the	 lower	 part	 of	 the	 house	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">brilliantly	 illuminated.	 But	 as	 the	 windows	 in	 the	 beautiful	 linen-panelled	 hall were	 diamond-paned,	 the	 brilliance	 was	 softened,	 and	 there	 was	 something</p>
<p class="calibre1">deliriously	 welcoming,	 almost	 fairy-like,	 in	 the	 picture	 the	 old	 house	 presented to	its	new	owner's	eager	gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	while	he	stayed	his	steps	near	the	narrow	brick	bridge	which	spanned	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">moat	 where	 a	 carriage	 road	 connected	 the	 domain	 of	 Wyndfell	 Hall	 with	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">outside	 world,	 and,	 as	 he	 stood	 there	 in	 the	 gathering	 twilight,	 he	 looked	 a romantic	figure.	Tall	 and	well-built,	he	 took,	perhaps,	an	 almost	excessive	care</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	his	dress.	Yet	there	was	nothing	effeminate	or	foppish	about	his	appearance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 follower	 of	 that	 now	 forgotten	 science,	 phrenology,	 would	 have	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">impressed	 by	 Lionel	 Varick's	 head.	 It	 was	 large	 and	 well-shaped,	 with	 a	 great deal	of	almost	golden	hair,	now	showing	a	white	thread	or	two,	which	did	not, </p>
<p class="calibre1">however,	 detract	 from	 his	 look	 of	 youth.	 He	 had	 a	 fine	 broad	 forehead;	 deep, well-set	 grey	 eyes;	 and	 a	 beautiful,	 sensitive	 mouth,	 which	 he	 took	 care	 not	 to conceal	 with	 a	 moustache.	 Thus	 in	 almost	 any	 company	 he	 would	 have	 looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">striking	 and	 distinguished—the	 sort	 of	 man	 of	 whom	 people	 ask,	 "Who	 is	 that standing	over	there?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	 was	 a	 man	 of	 moods—subject,	 that	 is,	 to	 fits	 of	 exultation	 and	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">depression—and	 yet	 with	 an	 amazing	 power	 of	 self-control,	 and	 of	 entirely</p>
<p class="calibre1">hiding	what	he	felt	from	those	about	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>To-night	 his	 mood	 was	 one	 of	 exultation.	 He	 almost	 felt	 what	 Scots	 call	 "fey." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	seemed	to	tell	him	that	he	was	within	reach	of	the	fruition	of	desires</p>
<p class="calibre1">which,	even	in	his	most	confident	moments,	had	appeared	till	now	wildly	out	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	possibility	of	attainment.	He	came,	on	both	his	father's	and	his	mother's	side, </p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 people	 who	 had	 lived	 for	 centuries	 the	 secure,	 pleasant	 life	 of	 the	 English county	gentry.	But	instead	of	taking	advantage	of	their	opportunities,	the	Varicks</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 gone	 not	 upwards,	 but	 steadily	 downwards—the	 final	 crash	 having	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">owing	to	the	folly,	indeed	the	far	more	than	folly,	as	Lionel	Varick	had	come	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">know	when	still	a	child,	of	his	own	father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lionel's	 father	 had	 not	 lived	 long	 after	 his	 disgraceful	 bankruptcy.	 But	 he	 had had	time	to	imbue	his	boy	with	an	intense	pride	in	the	past	glories	of	the	Varick</p>
<p class="calibre1">family.	 So	 it	 was	 that	 the	 shabby,	 ugly	 little	 villa	 where	 his	 boyhood	 had	 been spent	 on	 the	 outskirts	 of	 a	 town	 famous	 for	 its	 grammar-school,	 and	 where	 his mother	settled	for	her	boy's	sake	after	her	husband's	death,	had	been	peopled	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">young	Varick	with	visions	of	just	such	a	country	home	as	was	this	wonderful	old</p>
<p class="calibre1">house	now	before	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	wonder	he	felt	"fey"	to-night.	Everything	was	falling	out	as	he	had	hoped	it would	do.	He	had	staked	very	high—staked,	indeed,	all	that	a	man	can	stake	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	 complex	 civilization,	 and	 he	 had	 won!	 In	 the	 whole	 wide	 world	 there	 was only	one	human	being	who	wished	him	ill.	This	was	an	elderly	woman,	named</p>
<p class="calibre1">Julia	 Pigchalke,	 who	 had	 been	 his	 late	 wife's	 one-time	 governess	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">companion.	She	had	been	his	enemy	from	the	first	day	they	had	met,	and	she	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">done	her	utmost	to	prevent	his	marriage	to	her	employer.	Even	now,	in	spite	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	 poor	 Milly's	 own	 solicitor	 called	 his	 "thoughtful	 generosity"	 to	 Miss Pigchalke,	the	woman	was	pursuing	Varick	with	an	almost	insane	hatred.	About</p>
<p class="calibre1">six	months	ago	she	had	called	on	Dr.	Panton,	the	clever	young	medical	man	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	attended	poor	Mrs.	Varick	during	her	last	illness.	She	had	formulated	vague</p>
<p class="calibre1">accusations	 against	 Varick—accusations	 of	 cruelty	 and	 neglect	 of	 so	 absurd	 a nature	 that	 they	 refuted	 themselves.	 Miss	 Pigchalke's	 behaviour	 was	 the	 more monstrous	 that	 she	 had	 already	 received	 the	 first	 fifty	 pounds	 of	 the	 hundred-pound	pension	her	friend's	widower	had	arranged	to	give	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	a	will	made	before	her	marriage,	the	late	Mrs.	Varick	had	left	her	companion</p>
<p class="calibre1">two	 thousand	 pounds,	 and	 though	 the	 legacy	 had	 been	 omitted	 from	 her	 final will,	 Varick	 had	 of	 his	 own	 accord	 suggested	 that	 he	 should	 allow	 Miss</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pigchalke	a	hundred	a	year.	She	had	begun	by	sending	back	the	first	half-yearly</p>
<p class="calibre1">cheque;	 but	 she	 had	 finally	 accepted	 it!	 To-night	 he	 reminded	 himself	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">satisfaction	that	the	second	fifty	pounds	had	already	been	sent	her,	and	that	this</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>time	she	would	evidently	make	no	bones	about	keeping	the	money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Making	a	determined	effort,	he	chased	her	sinister	image	from	his	thoughts,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned	his	mind	to	the	still	attractive	woman	who	was	about	to	act	as	hostess	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	Christmas	party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	keen	face	softened	as	he	thought	of	Blanche	Farrow.	Poor,	proud,	well-bred</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 pleasant,	 poor	 only	 in	 a	 relative	 sense,	 for	 she	 was	 the	 only	 unmarried daughter	of	an	Irish	peer	whose	title	had	passed	away	to	a	distant	cousin.	Miss</p>
<p class="calibre1">Farrow	could	have	lived	in	comfort	and	in	dignity	on	what	income	she	had,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 one	 inexplicable	 failing—the	 more	 old-fashioned	 and	 severe	 of	 her	 friends and	relatives	called	it	a	vice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon	 after	 she	 had	 come	 into	 the	 enjoyment	 of	 her	 few	 hundreds	 a	 year,	 some rich,	idle	acquaintance	had	taken	Blanche	to	Monte	Carlo,	and	there,	like	a	duck</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	water,	she	had	taken	to	play!	Henceforth	gambling—any	kind	of	gambling—</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 become	 her	 absorbing	 interest	 in	 life.	 It	 was	 well	 indeed	 that	 what	 fortune she	had	was	strictly	settled	on	her	sisters'	children,	her	two	brothers-in-law	being</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 trustees.	 With	 one	 of	 them,	 who	 was	 really	 wealthy,	 she	 had	 long	 ago</p>
<p class="calibre1">quarrelled.	With	the	other,	now	a	widower,	with	only	a	life	interest	in	his	estate, </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	was	on	coldly	cordial	terms,	and	sometimes,	as	was	the	case	now,	acted	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">chaperon	to	his	only	child,	her	niece	and	namesake,	Bubbles	Dunster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	Farrow	never	begged	or	borrowed.	When	more	hard	hit	than	usual,	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">retired,	alone	with	her	faithful	maid,	to	some	cheap	corner	of	the	Continent;	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	she	kept	her	money	worries	to	herself,	she	was	well	liked	and	popular	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">considerable	circle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such	was	the	human	being	who	in	a	sense	was	Lionel	Varick's	only	close	friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 had	 met	 in	 a	 strange	 way,	 some	 ten	 years	 ago,	 in	 what	 Miss	 Farrow's sterner	 brother-in-law	 had	 called	 a	 gambling	 hell.	 And,	 just	 as	 we	 know	 that sometimes	Satan	will	be	found	rebuking	sin,	so	Blanche	Farrow	had	set	herself</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	stop	the	then	young	Lionel	Varick	on	the	brink.	He	had	been	in	love	with	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 that	 time,	 and	 on	 the	 most	 unpleasant	 evening	 when	 a	 cosy	 flat	 in	 Jermyn Street	had	been	raided	by	the	police,	he	had	given	Blanche	Farrow	his	word	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 would	 never	 play	 again;	 and	 he	 had	 kept	 his	 word.	 He	 alone	 knew	 how</p>
<p class="calibre1">grateful	he	had	cause	to	be	to	the	woman	who	had	saved	him	from	joining	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">doomed	throng	who	only	live	for	play. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 now	 there	 was	 still	 to	 their	 friendship	 just	 that	 delightful	 little	 touch	 of sentiment	 which	 adds	 salt	 and	 savour	 to	 almost	 every	 relation	 between	 a	 man</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>and	a	woman.	Though	Blanche	was	some	years	older	than	Lionel,	she	looked,	if anything,	younger	than	he	did,	for	she	had	the	slim,	upright	figure,	the	pretty	soft</p>
<p class="calibre1">brown	 hair,	 and	 the	 delicate,	 finely	 modelled	 features	 which	 keep	 so	 many	 an Englishwoman	of	her	type	and	class	young—young,	if	not	in	years,	yet	young	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything	else	that	counts.	Even	what	she	sometimes	playfully	called	her	 <i class="calibre4">petit</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">vice</i>	 had	 not	 made	 her	 haggard	 or	 worn,	 and	 she	 had	 never	 lost	 interest	 in becoming,	well-made	clothes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	 Farrow	 thought	 she	 knew	 everything	 there	 was	 to	 know	 about	 Lionel</p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick,	 and,	 as	 a	 matter	 of	 fact,	 she	 did	 know	 a	 great	 deal	 no	 one	 else	 knew, though	 not	 quite	 as	 much	 as	 she	 believed.	 She	 knew	 him	 to	 be	 a	 hedonist,	 a materialist,	a	man	who	had	very	few	scruples.	But	not	even	to	herself	would	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	allowed	him	to	be	called	by	the	ugly	name	of	adventurer.	Perhaps	it	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 truer	 to	 say—for	 she	 was	 a	 very	 clever	 woman—that	 even	 if,	 deep	 in	 her heart,	she	must	have	admitted	that	such	a	name	would	have	once	suited	him,	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	now	gladly	tell	herself	that	"all	that"	lay	far	behind	him.	As	we	have	seen, he	 owed	 this	 change	 in	 his	 circumstances	 to	 a	 happy	 draw	 in	 the	 lottery	 of marriage,	a	draw	which	has	so	often	turned	an	adventurer	of	sorts	into	a	man	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">substance	and	integrity. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	III</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">There	is	generally	something	a	little	dull	and	formal	during	the	first	evening	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">country	house	party;	and	if	this	is	true	when	most	of	the	people	know	each	other, </p>
<p class="calibre1">how	far	more	so	is	it	the	case	with	such	a	party	as	that	which	was	now	gathered</p>
<p class="calibre1">together	at	Wyndfell	Hall! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lionel	Varick	sat	at	one	end	of	the	long	oak	refectory	table,	Blanche	Farrow	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 other.	 But	 though	 the	 table	 was	 far	 wider	 than	 are	 most	 refectory	 tables	 (it was	believed	to	be,	because	of	its	width,	a	unique	specimen),	yet	Blanche,	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">soon	 after	 they	 had	 sat	 down,	 told	 herself	 that	 there	 was	 something	 to	 be	 said, after	 all,	 for	 the	 old-fashioned,	 Victorian	 mahogany.	 Such	 a	 party	 as	 was	 this party	 would	 have	 sorted	 themselves	 out,	 and	 really	 enjoyed	 themselves	 much</p>
<p class="calibre1">more,	 sitting	 in	 couples	 round	 an	 ordinary	 dining-table,	 than	 at	 this	 narrow, erstwhile	monastic	board.	Here	they	were	just	a	little	bit	too	near	together—too</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	 <i class="calibre4">vis-à-vis</i>,	so	Blanche	put	it	to	herself	with	a	dissatisfied	feeling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 soon	 things	 began	 going	 a	 little	 better.	 It	 had	 been	 her	 suggestion	 that champagne	should	be	offered	with	the	soup,	and	already	it	was	having	an	effect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	relieved	to	see	that	the	oddly	assorted	men	and	women	about	her	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">brisking	up,	and	beginning	to	talk,	even	to	laugh,	with	one	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	host's	right	sat	Miss	Burnaby.	She	was	at	once	quaint	and	commonplace</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking,	the	most	noticeable	thing	about	her	being	the	fact	that	she	wore	a	cap.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 made	 of	 fine	 Mechlin	 lace	 threaded	 with	 pale-blue	 ribbon,	 and,	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman	 now	 looking	 at	 her,	 suggested	 an	 interesting	 survival	 of	 the	 Victorian age.	Quite	old	ladies	had	worn	such	caps	when	she,	Blanche	Farrow,	was	a	child! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	rest	of	Miss	Burnaby's	costume	consisted	of	a	high	black	silk	dress,	trimmed</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	splendid	point	lace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	 Burnaby	 was	 evidently	 enjoying	 herself.	 She	 had	 taken	 a	 glass	 of	 sherry, was	showing	no	fear	of	her	champagne,	and	had	just	helped	herself	substantially</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 delicious	 sole	 which	 was	 one	 of	 the	 special	 triumphs	 of	 the	 French	  <i class="calibre4">chef</i> who	 had	 come	 down	 for	 a	 month	 to	 Wyndfell	 Hall.	 He	 and	 Miss	 Farrow	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">discussed	to-night's	menu	together	that	morning,	and	he	had	spoken	with	modest</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>enthusiasm	of	this	 <i class="calibre4">Sole	à	la	Cardinal</i>.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	other	side	of	the	host	sat	Helen	Brabazon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	looked	at	the	late	Mrs.	Varick's	one	intimate	friend	with	critical	interest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes,	 Miss	 Brabazon	 looked	 Somebody,	 though	 a	 somewhat	 old-fashioned</p>
<p class="calibre1">Somebody,	 considering	 that	 she	 was	 still	 quite	 a	 young	 woman.	 She	 had	 good hair,	 a	 good	 complexion,	 and	 clear,	 honest-looking	 hazel	 eyes;	 but	 not	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">kindest	friends	would	have	called	her	pretty.	What	charm	she	had	depended	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 look	 of	 perfect	 health,	 and	 her	 alert,	 intelligent	 expression	 of	 face.	 Miss Farrow,	who	was	well	read,	and,	indeed,	had	a	fine	taste	in	literature,	told	herself</p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly	 that	 Miss	 Brabazon	 was	 rather	 her	 idea	 of	 Jane	 Austen's	 Emma!	 Her dark-blue	 velvet	 dress,	 though	 it	 set	 off	 her	 pretty	 skin,	 and	 the	 complexion which	 was	 one	 of	 her	 best	 points,	 yet	 was	 absurdly	 old,	 for	 a	 girl.	 Doubtless Miss	 Brabazon's	 gown	 had	 been	 designed	 by	 the	 same	 dressmaker	 who	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">made	her	mother's	presentation	dress	some	thirty	years	before.	Such	dressmakers</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	a	quaint	survival	of	the	Victorian	age,	and	to	them	old-fashioned	people	keep</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	going	from	a	sense	of	loyalty,	or	perhaps	because	they	are	honestly	ignorant</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	what	strides	in	beauty	and	elegance	other	dressmakers	have	made	in	the	last</p>
<p class="calibre1">quarter	of	a	century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 hostess's	 eye	 travelled	 slowly	 round	 the	 table.	 How	 ludicrous	 the	 contrast between	 Helen	 Brabazon	 and	 Bubbles	 Dunster!	 Yet	 they	 were	 probably	 very</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	of	an	age.	Bubbles,	who	looked	such	a	child,	must	now	be—yes,	not	far</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	two-and-twenty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	 Farrow	 checked	 a	 sigh.	 She	 had	 been	 twenty-one	 herself—but	 what	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">charming,	distinguished,	delightful	twenty-one—when	she	had	formed	one	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	group	round	the	font	of	St.	Peter's,	Eaton	Square.	She	remembered	what	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">ugly	baby	she	had	thought	Bubbles,	and	how	she	had	been	anything	but	pleased</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	 someone	 present	 facetiously	 observed	 that	 god-mother	 and	 godchild	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	much	the	same	type	of	nose	and	ears	and	mouth! </p>
<p class="calibre1">To-night	Bubbles	was	wearing	an	eccentric,	and	yet	very	becoming	garment.	To</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	uninitiated	it	might	have	appeared	fashioned	out	of	an	old-fashioned	chintz</p>
<p class="calibre1">curtain.	 As	 a	 matter	 of	 fact,	 the	 intricate	 flower	 pattern	 with	 which	 it	 was covered	had	been	copied	on	a	Lyons	loom	from	one	of	those	eighteenth	century</p>
<p class="calibre1">embroidered	waistcoats	which	are	rightly	prized	by	connoisseurs.	The	dress	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">cut	 daringly	 low,	 back	 and	 front,	 especially	 back,	 and	 the	 girl	 wore	 no	 jewels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 through	 her	 "bobbed"	 hair	 was	 tucked	 a	 brilliant	 little	 silk	 flag,	 which</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>carried	out	and	emphasized	the	colouring	of	the	flowers	scattered	over	the	pale pink	silk	of	which	its	wearer's	gown	was	made. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles,	in	that	staid	and	decorous	company,	looked	as	if	she	had	wandered	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	some	gay	Venetian	masquerade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	now	sitting	between	the	millionaire,	James	Tapster,	and	her	own	friend, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bill	Donnington.	When	she	had	heard	that	she	had	been	placed	next	Donnington, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	had	pouted.	"I'd	rather	have	had	Sir	Lyon,"	she	exclaimed,	"or	even	the old	 'un!"—for	 so	 she	 irreverently	 designated	 Helen	 Brabazon's	 uncle,	 Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Burnaby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Blanche	Farrow	had	been	firm.	Sir	Lyon	must	of	course	be	on	her	own	right</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand,	 Mr.	 Burnaby	 on	 her	 left.	 It	 is	 always	 difficult	 to	 arrange	 a	 party	 of	 four ladies	and	five	men.	She	had	suggested	more	than	one	other	pleasant	woman	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">make	 up	 the	 party	 to	 ten,	 but	 Varick	 had	 had	 some	 objection	 to	 each—the</p>
<p class="calibre1">objection	 usually	 taking	 the	 line	 that	 the	 person	 proposed	 would	 not	 "get	 on" </p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	Burnabys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	 again	 wondered	 why	 their	 host	 had	 been	 so	 determined	 to	 have	 Helen Brabazon	 at	 his	 first	 house-party,	 if	 her	 coming	 meant	 the	 inclusion	 of	 her tiresome	uncle	and	aunt?	And	then	she	felt	a	little	ashamed	of	herself.	One	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">best	 points	 about	 Lionel	 Varick	 was	 his	 sense	 of	 gratitude	 to	 anyone	 who	 had done	 him	 a	 good	 turn.	 Gratitude	 had	 been	 the	 foundation	 of	 their	 own	 now</p>
<p class="calibre1">many-year-long	friendship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 food	 was	 so	 very	 good,	 there	 was	 so	 much	 of	 it,	 and	 doubtless	 those	 who had	journeyed	down	to	Wyndfell	Hall	to-night	were	all	so	hungry,	that	there	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather	less	talk	going	on	round	the	table	than	might	have	been	expected.	But	now</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 again	 the	 hostess	 caught	 a	 fleeting	 interchange	 of	 words.	 She	 heard,	 for instance,	 old	 Miss	 Burnaby	 informing	 young	 Donnington	 that	 she	 had	 been	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">good	deal	on	the	Continent	as	a	young	woman,	and	had	actually	spent	a	year	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Austria	a	matter	of	forty	years	ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 the	 meal	 went	 on,	 Miss	 Farrow	 gradually	 became	 aware	 that	 Bubbles</p>
<p class="calibre1">provided	what	life	and	soul	there	was	in	the	dull	party.	But	for	Bubbles,	but	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	infectious	high	spirits	and	vitality,	how	very	heavy	and	stupid	the	meal	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	now	ending	would	have	been!	She	asked	herself,	for	perhaps	the	twentieth</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	 in	 the	 last	 three-quarters	 of	 an	 hour,	 why	 her	 friend	 had	 brought	 together such	a	curious	and	ill-assorted	set	of	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>At	last	she	looked	across	at	Miss	Burnaby,	and	gradually	everyone	got	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	was	at	the	door	in	a	moment,	holding	it	open,	and,	as	they	filed	by	him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">managing	 to	 say	 a	 word	 to	 each	 of	 the	 four	 ladies.	 "Bravo,	 Bubbles!"	 Blanche heard	 him	 whisper.	 "You're	 earning	 your	 Christmas	 present	 right	 royally!"	 and the	 girl's	 eyes	 flashed	 up	 into	 her	 host's	 with	 a	 mischievous,	 not	 over-friendly glance.	 Miss	 Farrow	 was	 aware	 that	 Bubbles	 did	 not	 much	 care	 for	 Lionel</p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick.	She	rather	wondered	why.	But	she	was	far	too	shrewd	not	to	know	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">there's	no	accounting	either	for	likings	or	dislikings	where	a	man	and	a	woman</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	concerned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 she	 shepherded	 her	 little	 party	 across	 the	 staircase	 lobby,	 she	 managed	 to mutter	into	her	niece's	ear:	"I	want	you	to	take	on	Miss	Burnaby	for	me,	Bubbles</p>
<p class="calibre1">—I'm	anxious	to	make	friends	with	Helen	Brabazon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	are	times	when	what	one	must	call	for	want	of	a	better	term	the	social	rites</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	existence	interfere	most	unwarrantably	with	the	elemental	happenings	of	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	on	this	first	evening	at	Wyndfell	Hall	the	coming	of	coffee	and	of	liqueurs</p>
<p class="calibre1">proved	a	welcome	diversion.	Miss	Burnaby	smiled	a	pleased	smile	as	she	sipped</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 Benedictine	 which	 a	 footman	 had	 poured	 into	 a	 tall	 green-and-gold</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bohemian	liqueur-glass	for	her.	She,	at	any	rate,	was	enjoying	her	visit.	And	so, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	 Farrow	 decided,	 was	 the	 old	 lady's	 niece,	 for	 "How	 beautiful	 and perfect	 everything	 is!"	 exclaimed	 the	 girl;	 and	 indeed	 the	 room	 in	 which	 they now	found	themselves	was	singularly	charming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	somehow	Miss	Farrow	felt	that	the	speaker	was	not	alluding	so	much	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">room,	as	to	the	way	everything	was	being	done,	and	her	heart	warmed	to	the	girl, </p>
<p class="calibre1">for	she	was	really	anxious	that	Lionel's	first	party	should	be	a	success. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	they	had	settled	themselves	in	the	lovely,	delicately	austere-looking	white</p>
<p class="calibre1">parlour,	 as	 it	 was	 called,	 which	 again	 suggested	 to	 Blanche	 Farrow	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">atmosphere	 of	 Jane	 Austen's	 "Emma,"	 Bubbles	 dutifully	 sat	 herself	 down	 by Miss	 Burnaby.	 Soon	 she	 was	 talking	 to	 that	 lady	 in	 a	 way	 which	 at	 once</p>
<p class="calibre1">fascinated	and	rather	frightened	her	listener.	Bubbles	had	a	very	pretty	manner	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">old	 people.	 It	 was	 caressing,	 deferential,	 half-humorously	 protecting.	 She	 liked to	shock	and	soothe	them	by	turns;	and	they	generally	yielded	themselves	gladly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">after	a	little	struggle,	both	to	the	shocking	and	to	the	soothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Farrow	and	Helen	Brabazon	sat	down	at	the	further	end	of	the	delightful, </p>
<p class="calibre1">gladsome-looking	room.	It	 was	hung	with	 a	delicate,	faded	 Chinese	paper;	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">against	 the	 walls	 stood	 a	 few	 pieces	 of	 fine	 white	 lacquer	 furniture.	 The	 chairs</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>were	painted—some	French,	some	Heppelwhite.	Over	the	low	mantelpiece	was framed	a	long,	narrow	piece	of	exquisite	embroidery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	suppose	you	have	often	stayed	here?"	began	Miss	Farrow	civilly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	 Brabazon	 looked	 at	 her,	 surprised.	 "I've	 never	 been	 here	 before!"	 she exclaimed.	 "How	 could	 I	 have	 been?	 I've	 only	 known	 Mr.	 Varick	 for,	 let	 me see,"—she	hesitated—"a	very	little	over	a	year." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	you	were	a	great	friend	of	his	wife's—at	least	so	I	understood?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	 concealed,	 successfully,	 her	 very	 real	 astonishment.	 She	 had	 certainly been	 told	 by	 Lionel	 that	 Miss	 Brabazon	 and	 "poor	 Milly"	 had	 been	 intimate friends;	that	this	fact	was,	indeed,	the	only	link	between	Miss	Brabazon	and	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">host. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 girl	 now	 sitting	 opposite	 to	 her	 flushed	 deeply,	 and	 suddenly	 Blanche</p>
<p class="calibre1">Farrow	realized	that	there	was	a	good	deal	of	character	and	feeling	in	the	open, </p>
<p class="calibre1">ingenuous	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	 that's	 true.	 We	 became	 great	 friends"—a	 note	 of	 emotion	 broke	 into	 the steady,	 well-modulated	 voice—"but	 our	 friendship	 was	 not	 an	 old	 friendship, Miss	Farrow.	I	only	knew	Milly—well,	I	suppose	I	knew	her	about	ten	weeks	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ten	 weeks	 in	 all?"	 This	 time	 Blanche	 Farrow	 could	 not	 keep	 the	 surprise	 she felt	 out	 of	 her	 voice.	 "What	 an	 extraordinary	 mistake	 for	 me	 to	 have	 made!	 I thought	you	had	been	life-long	friends." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	 shook	 her	 head.	 "What	 happened	 was	 this.	 A	 friend	 of	 mine—I	 mean	 a really	old	friend—had	a	bad	illness,	and	I	took	her	down	to	Redsands—you	may</p>
<p class="calibre1">know	it,	a	delightful	little	village	not	far	from	Walmer.	I	took	a	house	there,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	 and	 Mrs.	 Varick	 had	 the	 house	 next	 door.	 We	 made	 friends,	 I	 mean	 Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	 and	 myself,	 over	 the	 garden	 wall,	 and	 he	 asked	 me	 if	 I	 would	 mind coming	in	some	day	and	seeing	his	wife.	I	had	a	great	deal	of	idle	time	on	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands,	so	very	soon	I	spent	even	more	time	with	the	Varicks	than	I	did	with	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">friend,	and	she—I	mean	poor	Milly—became	very,	very	fond	of	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 a	 pause.	 And	 then	 the	 younger	 woman	 went	 on:	 "And	 if	 we	 knew each	 other	 for	 such	 a	 short	 time,	 as	 one	 measures	 time,	 I	 on	 my	 side	 soon	 got very	fond	of	Milly.	Though	she	was	a	good	deal	over	thirty"—again	the	listener</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt	 a	 thrill	 of	 unreasoning	 surprise—"there	 was	 something	 very	 simple	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>young	about	poor	Milly." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 speaker	 stopped,	 and	 Blanche,	 leaning	 forward,	 exclaimed:	 "I	 am	 deeply interested	in	what	you	tell	me,	Miss	Brabazon!	I	have	never	liked	to	say	much	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lionel	about	his	wife;	but	I	have	always	so	wondered	what	she	was	really	like?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	simply	adored	Mr.	Varick,"	Helen	answered	eagerly.	"She	worshipped	him! </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	always	making	plans	as	to	what	she	and	'Lionel'	would	do	when	she	got</p>
<p class="calibre1">better.	 I	 myself	 thought	 it	 very	 wrong	 that	 all	 of	 them,	 including	 Dr.	 Panton, entered	into	a	kind	of	conspiracy	not	to	let	her	know	how	ill	she	was." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	think	that	was	right,"	said	Blanche	Farrow	shortly.	"Why	disturb	her	happiness</p>
<p class="calibre1">—if	indeed	she	was	happy?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	was	indeed!--very,	very	happy!"	cried	Helen.	"She	had	had	a	miserable	life as	a	girl,	and	even	after	she	was	grown	up.	When	she	met	Mr.	Varick,	and	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">fell	 in	 love	 at	 first	 sight,	 she'd	 hardly	 ever	 seen	 a	 man	 to	 speak	 to,	 excepting some	of	her	father's	tiresome	old	cronies—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Was	she	pretty?"	asked	Blanche	abruptly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	 no,"—the	 other	 shook	 her	 head	 decidedly.	 "Not	 at	 all	 pretty—in	 fact	 I suppose	 most	 people	 would	 have	 called	 her	  <i class="calibre4">very</i>	 plain.	 Poor	 Milly	 was	 sallow, and,	 when	 I	 knew	 her,	 very	 thin;	 but	 I	 believe	 she'd	 never	 been	 really	 strong, never	 really	 healthy."	 She	 hesitated,	 and	 then	 said	 in	 a	 low	 voice:	 "That	 made Mr.	Varick's	wonderful	devotion	to	her	all	the	more	touching." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	 Farrow	 hardly	 knew	 what	 to	 say.	 "Yes,	 indeed,"	 she	 murmured mechanically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lionel	 devoted	 to	 a	 plain,	 unhealthy	 woman?	 Somehow	 she	 found	 it	 quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">impossible	 to	 believe	 that	 he	 could	 ever	 have	 been	 that.	 And	 yet	 there	 was	 no doubting	the	sincerity	of	the	girl's	accents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Both	 Dr.	 Panton	 and	 I	 used	 to	 agree,"	 Helen	 went	 on,	 "that	 he	 didn't	 give himself	 enough	 air	 and	 exercise.	 I	 hired	 a	 car	 for	 part	 of	 the	 time,	 and	 used	 to take	him	out	for	a	good	blow,	now	and	again." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	what	did	Mrs.	Varick	really	die	of?"	asked	Blanche	Farrow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pernicious	 anaemia,"	 answered	 Helen	 promptly.	 "It's	 a	 curious,	 little-known disease,	from	what	I	can	make	out.	The	doctor	told	me	he	thought	she	had	had	it</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>for	 a	 long	 time—or,	 at	 any	 rate,	 that	 she	 had	 had	 it	 for	 some	 years	 before	 she married	Mr.	Varick." </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	pause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	wonder	why	they	didn't	come	and	live	here?"	said	Miss	Farrow	thoughtfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	but	she	hated	Wyndfell	Hall!	You	see,	her	father's	whole	mind	had	been	set</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 nothing	 but	 this	 house,	 and	 making	 it	 as	 perfect	 as	 possible.	 It	 was	 in	 a dreadful	state	when	he	inherited	it	from	an	old	cousin;	yet	he	was	offered,	even</p>
<p class="calibre1">so,	an	enormous	sum	for	some	of	the	wonderful	oak	ceilings.	But	he	refused	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">offer—indignantly,	 and	 he	 set	 himself	 to	 make	 it	 what	 it	 must	 have	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">hundreds	of	years	ago." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	 hardly	 succeeded	 in	 doing	 that,"	 observed	 Blanche	 Farrow	 dryly.	 "Our ancestors	 lived	 less	 comfortably	 than	 we	 do	 now,	 Miss	 Brabazon.	 Instead	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">beautiful	old	Persian	carpets,	there	must	have	been	rushes	on	all	the	floors.	And</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 for	 the	 furniture	 of	 those	 days—it	 was	 probably	 all	 made	 of	 plain,	 hard, unpolished	wood." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	 at	 any	 rate,"—the	 girl	 spoke	 with	 a	 touch	 of	 impatience—"Milly	 hated this	place.	She	told	me	once	she	had	never	known	a	day's	real	happiness	till	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">marriage.	 That's	 what	 made	 it	 seem	 so	 infinitely	 sad	 that	 it	 lasted	 such	 a	 short time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 suppose,"	 said	 the	 other	 slowly,	 "that	 they	 were	 married	 altogether	 about seven	months?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	fancy	rather	longer	than	that.	She	was	quite	well,	or	so	she	thought,	when	she married.	They	travelled	about	for	a	while	on	the	Continent,	and	she	told	me	once</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	enjoyed	every	minute	of	it!	And	then	her	health	began	to	give	way,	and	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">took	this	house	at	Redsands.	They	chose	it	because	Mr.	Varick	knew	something</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	doctor	there—he	didn't	know	him	very	well,	but	they	became	very	great</p>
<p class="calibre1">friends,	in	fact	such	friends	that	poor	Milly	left	him	a	legacy—I	think	it	was	five</p>
<p class="calibre1">hundred	 pounds.	 Dr.	 Panton	 was	 most	 awfully	 good	 to	 her,	 but	 of	 course	 he hadn't	 the	 slightest	 idea	 that	 she	 was	 leaving	 him	 anything.	 I	 never	 saw	 a	 man more	 surprised	 than	 he	 was	 when	 I	 told	 him	 about	 it	 the	 day	 of	 her	 death.	 Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	asked	me	to	do	so,	and	he	was	quite	overcome." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 smiled.	 Five	 hundred	 pounds	 evidently	 did	 not	 seem	 very	 much	 to	 Miss</p>
<p class="calibre1">Brabazon. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>"I	suppose	she	had	a	good	deal	of	money?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	late	Mrs.	Varick's	friend	hesitated	a	moment,	then	answered	at	last,	"I	think she	 had	 about	 twenty	 thousand	 pounds—at	 least	 I	 know	 that	 that	 sum	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">mentioned	in	the	 <i class="calibre4">Times</i>	list	of	wills." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 other	 was	 startled—disagreeably	 startled.	 She	 had	 understood,	 from</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	 Lionel	 had	 said	 to	 her,	 that	 he	 now	 had	 five	 thousand	 a	 year.	 "This place	must	be	worth	a	good	deal,"	she	observed.	She	told	herself	that	perhaps	the late	Mrs.	Varick	had	left	twenty	thousand	pounds	in	money,	and	that	the	bulk	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	income	had	come	from	land. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	 but	 unfortunately	 poor	 Milly	 couldn't	 leave	 Wyndfell	 Hall	 to	 Mr.	 Varick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	only	has	a	life	interest	in	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	 Brabazon	 spoke	 in	 a	 curiously	 decided	 way,	 as	 if	 she	 were	 used	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	was	again	 very	much	surprised.	 She	had	certainly	 understood	that	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">wonderful	 old	 house	 and	 its	 very	 valuable	 contents	 belonged	 to	 Lionel	 Varick absolutely.	 "Are	 you	 sure	 of	 that?"	 she	 began—and	 then	 she	 stopped	 speaking, for	her	quick	ears	had	detected	the	sound	of	an	opening	and	shutting	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	IV</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	few	moments	the	five	men	sorted	themselves	among	the	ladies.	Old	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Burnaby	 and	 young	 Donnington	 went	 and	 sat	 by	 Bubbles,	 the	 gloomy-looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">James	 Tapster	 also	 finally	 sidling	 uncertainly	 towards	 her.	 Sir	 Lyon	 civilly devoted	 himself	 to	 Miss	 Burnaby;	 and	 Lionel	 Varick	 came	 over	 to	 where</p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	Farrow	was	sitting,	and	said	something	to	her	in	a	low	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus	was	Helen	Brabazon	for	the	moment	left	out	in	the	cold.	She	turned,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">opening	a	prettily	bound	book	which	was	on	a	table	close	to	her	elbow,	began	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">read	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	looked	dubiously	at	his	silent	guest.	Leaning	again	towards	Miss	Farrow</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	whispered:	"I	don't	know	what	one	does	on	such	occasions,	Blanche.	Ought</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	we	to	have	a	round	game	or	something?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled	into	his	keen,	good-looking	face.	"You	 <i class="calibre4">are</i>	a	baby!	Or	are	you	only pretending,	Lionel?	Everyone's	quite	happy;	why	should	we	do	anything?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As	a	matter	of	fact,	both	Mr.	Burnaby	and	Miss	Burnaby	spoke	before	dinner	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	they	expected	to	be	entertained	in	some	way." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	think	something	out,"	she	said	a	little	wearily.	"Now	go	and	do	your	duty—</p>
<p class="calibre1">talk	to	Miss	Brabazon!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 got	 up	 and	 moved	 slowly	 towards	 the	 fireplace,	 telling	 herself	 the	 while, with	a	certain	irritation,	that	Lionel	was	not	showing	his	usual	alert	intelligence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 all	 very	 well	 to	 invite	 this	 young	 woman	 who	 had	 been	 so	 kind	 to	 poor Milly;	and	the	fact	that	she	and	her	tiresome	old	uncle	and	aunt	were,	if	Lionel</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	right,	very	wealthy,	was	not	without	a	certain	interest.	But	still—! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche,	with	a	certain	grim,	inward	smile,	remembered	a	story	she	had	thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 the	 time	 rather	 funny.	 That	 of	 a	 lady	 who	 had	 said	 to	 her	 husband,	 "Oh,	 do come	 and	 see	 them,	 they	 are	 so	 very	 rich."	 And	 he	 had	 answered,	 "My	 dear,	 I would	if	it	were	catching!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately,	Blanche	Farrow	had	only	too	much	reason	to	know	that	wealth	is</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>not	 catching.	 Also,	 to	 one	 with	 her	 brilliant,	 acute	 mind,	 there	 was	 something peculiarly	irritating	in	the	sight	of	very	rich	people	who	didn't	know	how	to	use</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	wealth,	either	to	give	themselves,	or	others,	pleasure.	Such	people,	she	felt</p>
<p class="calibre1">sure,	 were	 Mr.	 and	 Miss	 Burnaby—and	 doubtless,	 also,	 their	 heiress,	 Helen</p>
<p class="calibre1">Brabazon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bubbles!"	 she	 exclaimed	 imperiously,	 under	 her	 breath.	 "Come	 here	 for	 a minute."	And	Bubbles,	with	a	touch	of	reluctance,	got	up	and	left	the	three	men</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	whom	she	was	talking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	she	came	towards	her,	her	aunt	was	struck	by	the	girl's	look	of	ill-health	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">unease. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	wish	you	could	think	of	something	that	would	stir	us	all	up,"	she	said	in	a	low voice.	And	then,	in	a	lower	voice	still,	for	her	niece	was	now	close	to	her,	"The Burnabys	 look	 the	 sort	 of	 people	 who	 would	 enjoy	 a	 parlour	 game,"	 she	 said rather	crossly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then,	all	of	a	sudden,	Bubbles	gave	a	queer	little	leap	into	the	air.	"I've	got it!"	she	exclaimed.	"Let's	hold	a	séance!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	 séance?"	 repeated	 Blanche	 Farrow	 in	 a	 dubious	 tone.	 "I	 don't	 think	 Miss Burnaby	would	enjoy	that	at	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	 but	 she	 would!"—Bubbles	 spoke	 confidently.	 "Didn't	 you	 hear	 her	 at dinner?	 She	 was	 telling	 Sir	 Lyon	 about	 some	 friend	 of	 hers	 who's	 become</p>
<p class="calibre1">tremendously	keen	about	that	sort	of	thing.	To	tell	you	the	truth,	Blanche"	(these two	 had	 never	 been	 on	 very	 formal	 terms	 together,	 and	 in	 a	 way	 Bubbles	 was much	 fonder	 of	 her	 aunt	 than	 her	 aunt	 was	 of	 her)—"To	 tell	 you	 the	 truth, Blanche,"	she	repeated,	"ever	since	I	arrived	here	I've	told	myself	that	it	would be	rather	amusing	to	try	something	of	the	kind.	It's	a	strange	old	house;	there's	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">funny	kind	of	atmosphere	about	it;	I	felt	it	the	moment	I	arrived." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 other	 looked	 at	 her	 sharply.	 "I've	 always	 avoided	 that	 sort	 of	 thing,	 and	 I don't	 see	 it	 doing	 you	 much	 good,	 Bubbles!	 You	 know	 how	 your	 father	 feels about	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	 Farrow	 did	 not	 often	 interfere	 in	 other	 people's	 affairs,	 but	 she	 had suddenly	remembered	certain	phrases	in	her	brother-in-law's	letter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Daddy	 has	 been	 put	 up	 to	 making	 a	 fuss	 by	 a	 goody-goody	 widow	 who's making	up	to	him	just	now."	Bubbles	spoke	lightly,	but	she	looked	vexed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>Blanche	 Farrow	 felt	 sorry	 she	 had	 said	 anything.	 Bubbles	 was	 behaving	 very nicely	 just	 now.	 It	 was	 the	 greatest	 comfort	 to	 have	 her	 here.	 So	 she	 said, smiling,	"Oh,	well,	I	shan't	regret	your	trying	something	of	the	kind	if	you	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">galvanize	these	dull	folk	into	life." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	 do	 more	 than	 that,"	 said	 Bubbles	 easily.	 "I'll	 give	 them	 creeps!	 But, Blanche?	I	want	you	to	back	me	up	if	I	say	I'm	tired,	or	don't	want	to	go	on	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	Farrow	felt	surprised.	"I	don't	quite	understand,"	she	exclaimed.	"Aren't we	going	to	do	table-turning?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	 said	 the	 girl	 deliberately.	 "We're	 going	 to	 have	 a	 séance—a	 sitting.	 And I'm	going	to	be	the	medium." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	Bubbles!	Is	that	wise?"	She	looked	uncomfortably	into	the	girl's	now	eager, flushed	face.	"D'you	think	you	know	enough	about	these	people	to	be	a	success</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	it	this	very	first	evening?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles'	 gift	 of	 thought	 reading	 would	 of	 course	 come	 in;	 also	 the	 girl	 was	 a clever	actress;	still,	that	surely	wouldn't	take	her	very	far	with	a	set	of	people	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">whom	she	knew	 <i class="calibre4">nothing</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 only	 one	 I'm	 afraid	 of,"	 said	 Bubbles	 thoughtfully,	 "is	 Mr.	 Burnaby.	 He's such	a	proper	old	thing!	He	might	really	object—object	on	the	same	ground	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Daddy's	tiresome	widow	does.	However,	I	can	but	try." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	pirouetted	round,	and	quickly	drew	with	her	foot	a	gilt	footstool	from	under</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	 Empire	 settee.	 She	 stood	 upon	 it	 and	 clapped	 her	 hands.	 "Ladies	 and gentlemen!"	she	cried.	"This	is	a	time	of	year	when	ghosts	are	said	to	walk.	Why shouldn't	 we	 hold	 a	 séance,	 here	 and	 now,	 and	 call	 up	 spirits	 from	 the	 vasty deep?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	will	they	come?"	quoted	Sir	Lyon,	smiling	up	into	her	eager,	sensitive	little face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	 Lyon	 was	 quite	 enjoying	 Lionel	 Varick's	 Christmas	 house-party.	 For	 one</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing,	 he	 was	 interested	 in	 his	 host's	 personality.	 In	 a	 small	 way	 he	 had	 long made	a	study	of	Lionel	Varick,	and	it	amused	him	to	see	Varick	in	a	new	rôle—</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	of	a	prosperous	country	gentleman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly	Bubbles	found	an	ally	in	a	most	unexpected	quarter.	Helen	Brabazon</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>called	 out:	 "I've	 always	 longed	 to	 attend	 a	 séance!	 I	 did	 once	 go	 to	 a	 fortune-teller,	and	it	was	thrilling—." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	 stepped	 down	 off	 her	 footstool.	 She	 had	 the	 gift—which	 her	 aunt	 also possessed—of	allowing	another	to	take	the	field. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	 it	 was	 so	 exciting,"	 said	 Lionel	 Varick	 dryly,	 "I	 wonder	 that	 you	 only	 went once,	Miss	Brabazon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen's	face	grew	grave.	"I'll	tell	you	about	it	some	day,"	she	said	in	a	low	voice; </p>
<p class="calibre1">"as	a	matter	of	fact,	it	was	just	before	you	and	I	first	met." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,"	said	Varick	lightly.	"And	what	happened?	Do	tell	me!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	turned	to	him,	and	her	voice	dropped	to	a	whisper.	"She	described	Milly—</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	mean	the	fortune-teller	described	Milly,	almost	exactly.	She	told	me	that	Milly</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	going	to	play	a	great	part	in	my	life." </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	she	felt	sharply	sorry	she	had	said	as	much	or	as	little	as	she	had	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">for	her	host's	face	altered;	it	became,	from	a	healthy	pallor,	a	deep	red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Forgive	me!"	she	exclaimed.	"Forgive	me!	I	oughtn't	to	have	told	you—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	say	that.	You	can	tell	 <i class="calibre4">me</i>	anything!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	Farrow,	who	had	now	moved	forward	to	the	fireplace,	would	again	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 very	 much	 surprised	 had	 she	 heard	 the	 intense,	 intimate	 tone	 in	 which Lionel	Varick	uttered	those	few	words	to	his	late	wife's	friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	blushed—a	deep,	sudden	blush—and	Sir	Lyon,	looking	at	her	across	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">room,	told	himself	that	she	was	a	remarkable-looking	girl,	and	that	he	would	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 make	 friends	 with	 her.	 He	 liked	 the	 earnest,	 old-fashioned	 type	 of	 girl—but fate	rarely	threw	him	into	the	company	of	such	a	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	is	quite	unnecessary	for	any	of	you	to	move,"	observed	Bubbles	in	a	businesslike	 tone;	 "but	 we	 are	 likely	 to	 obtain	 much	 better	 results	 if	 we	 blow	 out	 the candles.	The	firelight	will	be	quite	enough." </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then,	to	everyone's	surprise,	Miss	Burnaby	spoke.	Her	voice	was	gentle	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">fretful.	 "I	 thought	 that	 there	 always	 had	 to	 be	 a	 medium	 at	 a	 séance,"	 she observed;	"when	I	went	with	a	friend	of	mine	to	what	she	called	a	Circle,	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	a	medium	there,	and	we	each	paid	her	half-a-crown." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>"Of	course	there	must	be	a	medium,"	said	Bubbles	quickly.	"And	 <i class="calibre4">I</i>	am	going	to be	the	medium	this	time,	Miss	Burnaby;	but	it	will	be	all	free	and	for	nothing—I</p>
<p class="calibre1">always	do	it	for	love!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	 looked	 at	 his	 young	 guest	 with	 a	 good	 deal	 of	 gratitude.	 He	 had	 never numbered	 himself	 among	 the	 girl's	 admirers.	 To	 him	 Bubbles	 was	 like	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">caricature	of	her	aunt.	But	now	he	told	himself	that	there	was	something	to	say, </p>
<p class="calibre1">after	 all,	 for	 this	 queer	 younger	 generation	 who	 dare	 everything!	 He	 supposed that	 Bubbles	 was	 going	 to	 entertain	 them	 with	 a	 clever	 exhibition	 of	 brilliant acting.	Lionel	Varick	was	no	mean	actor	himself,	and	it	was	as	connoisseur,	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">well	as	expert,	that	he	admired	the	gift	when	it	was	practised	by	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Spiritualism,	 table-turning,	 and	 fortune-telling—he	 bracketed	 them	 all	 together in	 his	 own	 mind—had	 never	 interested	 him	 in	 the	 least.	 But	 he	 realized	 dimly what	 a	 wonderful	 chance	 this	 new	 fashionable	 craze—for	 so	 he	 regarded	 it—</p>
<p class="calibre1">gives	 to	 the	 charlatan.	 He	 had	 always	 felt	 an	 attraction	 to	 that	 extraordinary eighteenth	century	adventurer,	Cagliostro,	and	to-night	he	suddenly	remembered</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	certain	passage	in	Casanova's	memoirs....	He	felt	rather	sorry	that	they	hadn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">planned	out	this—this	séance,	before	the	rest	of	the	party	had	arrived.	He	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	given	Bubbles	a	few	"tips"	which	would	have	made	her	task	easy,	and	the coming	séance	much	more	thrilling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	company	ranged	themselves	four	on	each	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Burnaby	sat	on	one	side	of	the	fireplace,	her	brother	on	the	other.	Next	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	old	lady	was	Sir	Lyon;	then	Helen	Brabazon;	last	their	host. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	opposite	side,	next	to	Mr.	Burnaby,	sat	the	fat-visaged	James	Tapster;	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	 was	 Blanche	 Farrow,	 looking	 on	 the	 proceedings	 with	 a	 certain	 cynical</p>
<p class="calibre1">amusement	and	interest,	and	next	to	Blanche,	and	nearest	to	where	Bubbles	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	established	herself	on	one	of	those	low	chairs	which	in	England	is	called	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">nursery	chair,	and	in	France	a	 <i class="calibre4">prie-dieu</i>,	was	young	Donnington.	He,	alone	of	the people	there,	looked	uncomfortable	and	disapproving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 they	 had	 all	 been	 seated,	 waiting	 they	 hardly	 knew	 for	 what,	 for	 a	 few moments,	 Bubbles	 leapt	 from	 her	 low	 chair	 and	 blew	 out	 all	 the	 candles,	 a somewhat	lengthy	task,	and	one	which	plunged	the	room	into	almost	darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	she	threw	a	big	log	of	wood	on	the	fire,	and	the	flames	shot	up,	filling	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">room	with	shafts	of	rosy,	fitful	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 a	 pause.	 Varick	 said	 something	 in	 a	 rather	 cheerful,	 matter-of-fact</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>voice	to	Miss	Brabazon,	and	Bubbles	turned	round	sharply:	"I'm	afraid	we	ought to	have	complete	silence—even	silence	of	thought,"	she	said	solemnly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	Farrow	looked	at	the	girl.	What	queer	jargon	was	this?	In	the	wavering</p>
<p class="calibre1">light	thrown	by	the	fire	Bubbles'	face	looked	tense	and	rather	strained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Was	it	possible,	Blanche	asked	herself	with	a	touch	of	uneasiness,	that	the	child</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 taking	 this	 seriously—that	 she	  <i class="calibre4">believed</i>	 in	 it	 at	 all?	 Her	 father	 thought	 so, but	then	Hugh	Dunster	was	such	an	old	fool! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	moments	ran	by.	One	or	two	of	the	chairs	creaked.	James	Tapster	yawned, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	he	put	up	his	hand	rather	unwillingly	to	hide	his	yawn.	He	thought	all	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">sort	 of	 thing	 very	 stupid,	 and	 so	 absolutely	 unnecessary.	 He	 had	 enjoyed</p>
<p class="calibre1">listening	to	Miss	Bubbles'	cheerful,	inconsequent	chatter.	It	irritated	him	that	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">should	have	been	dragged	away	from	him—for	so	he	put	it	to	himself—by	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">unpleasant,	 supercilious	 woman,	 Blanche	 Farrow.	 It	 was	 a	 pity	 that	 a	 nice	 girl like	 Miss	 Bubbles	 had	 such	 an	 aunt.	 Only	 the	 other	 day	 he	 had	 heard	 a	 queer story	 about	 Miss	 Farrow.	 The	 story	 ran	 that	 she	 had	 once	 been	 caught	 in	 a gambling	raid,	and	her	name	kept	out	of	the	papers	by	the	influence	of	a	man	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Home	Office	who	had	been	in	love	with	her	at	the	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>And	 then	 he	 looked	 up,	 startled	 for	 once—for	 strange,	 untoward	 sounds	 were issuing	 from	 the	 lips	 of	 Bubbles	 Dunster.	 The	 girl	 was	 leaning	 forward,	 her elbows	on	her	knees,	crouched	upon	the	low	chair,	her	slight,	sinuous	little	figure</p>
<p class="calibre1">bathed	in	red	 light.	She	was	 groaning,	rocking	herself	 backwards	and	 forwards</p>
<p class="calibre1">convulsively.	 To	 most	 of	 those	 present	 it	 was	 a	 strange,	 painful	 exhibition—</p>
<p class="calibre1">painful,	yet	certainly	thrilling! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly	she	began	to	speak,	and	the	words	poured	from	her	lips	with	a	kind	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">breathless	quickness.	But	 the	strange,	uncanny,	 startling	thing	about	 it	was	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 voice	 which	 uttered	 these	 staccato	 sentences	 was	 not	 Bubbles'	 well</p>
<p class="calibre1">modulated,	 drawling	 voice.	 It	 was	 the	 high,	 peevish	 voice	 of	 a	  <i class="calibre4">child</i>—a	 child speaking	 queer,	 broken	 English.	 Everyone	 present,	 even	 including	 Varick	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	 Farrow,	 who	 both	 believed	 it	 to	 be	 a	 clever	 and	 impudent	 piece	 of impersonation,	was	startled	and	taken	aback	by	the	extraordinary	phenomena	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">girl	now	presented.	Her	eyes	were	closed,	and	yet	her	head	was	thrust	forward	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	she	was	staring	at	the	big,	now	roaring,	wood	fire	before	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rushing	 out	 through	 her	 scarcely	 open	 lips,	 came	 the	 sing-song	 words:	 "Why bring	Laughing	Water	here?	Laughing	Water	frightened.	Laughing	Water	want	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">go	 away.	 Laughing	 Water	 hates	 this	 house.	 Please,	 Miss	 Bubbles,	 let	 Laughing Water	 go	 away!"	 And	 Bubbles—if	 it	 was	 Bubbles—twisted	 and	 turned	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">groaned,	as	if	in	agony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then,	to	the	amazement	of	all	those	who	were	there,	young	Donnington,	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">face	set	in	grim	lines,	suddenly	addressed	Bubbles,	or	the	little	pleading	creature</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	appeared	to	possess	the	girl:	"Don't	be	frightened,"	he	said	soothingly.	"No one's	going	to	hurt	Laughing	Water.	Everyone	in	this	room	is	good	and	kind." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	answer,	there	broke	from	Bubbles'	lips	a	loud	cry:	"No,	no,	no!	Bad	people—</p>
<p class="calibre1">cruel	people—here!	Bad	spirits,	too.	Bad	chair.	Laughing	Water	sitting	on	torture</p>
<p class="calibre1">chair!	Miss	Bubbles	change	chair.	Then	Laughing	Water	feel	better." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	 got	 up	 as	 an	 automaton	 might	 have	 got	 up,	 and	 Donnington,	 pushing</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward	one	of	the	painted	chairs,	drew	the	low,	tapestry	covered	 <i class="calibre4">prie-dieu</i>	from under	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	gave	a	deep,	deep	sigh	as	she	sat	down	again.	Then	she	turned	herself	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	chair	round	till	she	was	exactly	facing	Varick.	In	a	voice	which	had	suddenly</p>
<p class="calibre1">become	 much	 more	 her	 own	 voice	 she	 addressed	 him,	 speaking	 slowly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">earnestly:	"I	see	a	lady	standing	behind	you.	She	is	very	stern-looking.	She	has	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>pale,	 worn	 face,	 and	 dark	 blue	 eyes.	 They	 are	 very	 like	 your	 eyes.	 Her	 hair	 is parted	in	the	middle;	it	is	slightly	grey.	She	must	have	passed	over	about	fifteen</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 twenty	 years	 ago.	 I	 think	 it	 is	 your	 mother.	 She	 wants	 to,	 she	 wants	 to—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	 hesitated,	 and	 then,	 speaking	 now	 entirely	 in	 her	 own	 voice,	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1">exclaimed	with	a	kind	of	gasp—"to	warn	you	of	danger." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	 opened	 his	 lips,	 and	 then	 he	 closed	 them.	 He	 felt	 shaken	 with	 an	 over-mastering	emotion,	as	well	as	intense	surprise,	and,	yes,	of	fierce	anger	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">girl	for	daring	to	do	this—to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 Bubbles	 began	 again,	 staring	 as	 if	 at	 something	 beyond	 and	 behind	 him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now	 there's	 another	 figure,	 standing	 to	 your	 left.	 She	 is	 still	 near	 the	 earth plane.	I	cannot	place	her	at	all.	She	is	short	and	stout;	her	grey	hair	is	brushed</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	from	her	forehead.	I	do	not	feel	as	if	you	had	known	her	very	long." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 voice	 died	 away,	 then	 suddenly	 became	 stronger,	 more	 confident:	 "Your mother—if	it	is	your	mother—is	trying	to	shield	you	from	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 remained	 silent	 for	 a	 while.	 She	 seemed	 to	 be	 listening.	 Then	 she	 spoke again:	"I	get	a	word—what	is	it?—not	 <i class="calibre4">Ardour?	Aboard? </i>	No,	I	think	it's	 <i class="calibre4">Arbour</i>!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 gazed	 anxiously	 into	 Varick's	 pale,	 set	 face.	 "She	 says,	 'Remember	 the <i class="calibre4">Arbour</i>.'	D'you	follow	me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 asked	 the	 question	 with	 a	 certain	 urgency,	 and	 Bubbles'	 host	 nodded, </p>
<p class="calibre1">imperceptibly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 she	 left	 him,	 dragging	 her	 chair	 along	 till	 she	 was	 just	 opposite	 Helen Brabazon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	see	a	man	standing	behind	you,"	she	began;	"he	is	dressed	in	rather	curious, old-fashioned	cricketing	clothes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	look	of	amazement	and	understanding	passed	over	Helen's	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	went	on,	confidently:	"He	is	a	tall,	well-set-up	man.	He	has	light	brown</p>
<p class="calibre1">hair	and	grey	eyes.	He	is	smiling.	I	think	it	is	your	father.	Now	he	looks	grave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 is	 uneasy	 about	 you.	 He	 is	 sorry	 you	 came	 here,	 to	 Wyndfell	 Hall.	 Do	 you follow	me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 Helen	 shook	 her	 head.	 She	 felt	 bewildered	 and	 oppressed.	 "I	 wonder,"	 she said	falteringly,	"if	he	could	give	me	a	sign?	I	do	so	long	to	know	if	it	is	 <i class="calibre4">really</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>my	dear,	dear	father." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	Farrow	turned	a	little	hot.	It	was	too	bad	of	Bubbles	to	do	the	thing	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	way! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	 says—he	 says—I	 hear	 him	 say	 a	 word—"	 Bubbles	 stopped	 and	 knit	 her brows.	"'Girl,	girl'—no,	it	isn't	'girl'—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Girlie?"	murmured	Helen	under	her	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	that's	it!	'Girlie'—he	says	 <i class="calibre4">'girlie</i>.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	Brabazon	covered	her	face	with	her	hands.	She	was	deeply	moved.	What</p>
<p class="calibre1">wonderful	 thing	 was	 this?	 She	 told	 herself	 that	 never,	 never	 would	 she	 allow herself	to	speak	lightly	or	slightingly	of	spiritualism	again!	As	far	as	she	knew, </p>
<p class="calibre1">no	one	in	that	room,	not	even	her	uncle	or	aunt,	was	aware	that	"girlie"	had	been her	long	dead	father's	pet	name	for	his	only	child. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then,	quite	suddenly,	Bubbles'	voice	broke	into	a	kind	of	cry.	"Take	care!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	said.	"Take	care!	I	see	another	form.	It	has	taken	the	place	of	your	father.	I think	it	is	the	form	of	a	woman	who	has	passed	over,	and	who	loved	you	once, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 whose	 heart	 is	 now	 full	 of	 hatred.	 D'you	 follow	 me?	 Quick!	 quick!	 She's fading	away!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	shook	her	head.	"No,"	she	said	in	a	dull	voice,	"I	don't	follow	you	at	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	felt	acutely,	unreasonably	disappointed.	There	was	no	one	in	the	world	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	first	loved	and	then	hated	her,	or	who	 <i class="calibre4">could</i>	hate	her.	She	cast	her	mind	back to	some	of	her	schoolfellows;	but	no,	as	far	as	she	knew	they	were	all	still	alive, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 there	 was	 not	 one	 of	 them	 to	 whom	 these	 exaggerated	 terms	 of	 love	 and hatred	could	be	applied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	dragged	her	chair	on	till	she	was	just	opposite	Sir	Lyon	Dilsford. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	put	up	his	hand:	"Will	you	kindly	pass	me	by,	Laughing	Water?"	he	said,	in his	 full,	 pleasant	 voice.	 "I'm	 an	 adept,	 and	 I	 don't	 care	 for	 open	 Circles.	 If	 you don't	mind,	will	you	pass	on?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	Bubbles	dragged	on	her	chair	again	over	the	Aubusson	carpet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	now	opposite	Miss	Burnaby,	and	the	old	lady	was	looking	at	her	with	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">air	of	fear	and	curiosity	which	strangely	altered	her	round,	usually	placid	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>"I	see	a	tall	young	man	standing	behind	you,"	began	Bubbles	in	a	monotonous voice.	"He	has	such	a	funny-looking	long	coat	on;	a	queer-shaped	cap,	too.	Why, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he's	dripping	with	water!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then,	almost	as	if	in	spite	of	herself,	Miss	Burnaby	muttered:	"Our	brother</p>
<p class="calibre1">John,	who	was	drowned." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	wants	me	to	tell	you	that	he's	very	happy,	and	that	he	sends	you	your	father's and	mother's	love." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	waited	for	what	seemed	quite	a	long	time,	then	she	went	on	again:	"I	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">another	man.	He	is	a	very	good-looking	man.	He	has	a	high	forehead,	blue	eyes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	a	golden	mustache.	He	is	in	uniform.	Is	it	an	English	uniform?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Burnaby	shook	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	think	it's	an	Austrian	uniform,"	said	Bubbles	hesitatingly;	then	she	continued, in	that	voice	which	was	hers	and	yet	not	hers,	for	it	seemed	instinct	with	another</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind:	"He	says,	'My	love!	My	love,	why	did	you	lack	courage?'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 old	 lady	 covered	 her	 face	 with	 her	 hands.	 "Stop!	 Please	 stop,"	 she	 said pitifully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	 dragged	 her	 chair	 across	 the	 front	 of	 the	 fire	 till	 she	 was	 exactly opposite	Mr.	Burnaby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	few	moments	nothing	happened.	The	fire	had	died	down.	There	was	only	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">flicker	of	light	in	the	room.	Then	all	at	once	the	girl	gave	a	convulsive	shudder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	can't	help	it,"	she	muttered	in	a	frightened	tone.	"Someone's	coming	through!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	the	colour	went	out	of	the	healthy	old	man's	face.	"Eh,	what?"	he	exclaimed uneasily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	Mr.	Tapster,	he	had	thought	all	this	tomfoolery,	but	while	Bubbles	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">speaking	 to,	 or	 at,	 his	 sister,	 he	 had	 felt	 amazed,	 as	 well	 as	 acutely</p>
<p class="calibre1">uncomfortable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then	 there	 burst	 from	 Bubbles'	 lips	 words	 uttered	 in	 a	 broken,	 lamenting voice—a	young,	uncultivated	woman's	voice:	"I	did	forgive	you—for	sure.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">oh,	how	I've	longed	to	come	through	to	you	all	these	years!	You	was	cruel,	cruel</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	me,	Ted—and	I	was	kind	to	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 followed	 a	 very	 odd,	 untoward	 thing.	 Mr.	 Burnaby	 jumped	 up	 from	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>chair,	and	he	bolted—literally	bolted—from	the	room,	slamming	the	door	behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	gave	a	long,	long	sigh,	and	then	she	said	feebly:	"I'm	tired.	I	can't	go	on any	longer	now."	She	spoke	in	her	natural	voice,	but	all	the	lilt	and	confidence</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	as	if	drained	out	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone—perhaps	 it	 was	 Donnington,	 who	 had	 got	 up—began	 re-lighting	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">candles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	 one	 spoke	 for	 what	 seemed	 a	 long	 time.	 And	 then,	 to	 the	 infinite	 relief	 of Varick	and	Miss	Farrow,	the	door	opened,	and	the	butler	appeared,	followed	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	footmen.	They	were	bringing	in	various	kinds	of	drinks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	host	poured	out	and	mixed	a	rather	stiff	brandy	and	soda,	and	took	it	over	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	 Burnaby.	 "Do	 drink	 this,"	 he	 said	 solicitously.	 "And	 forgive	 me,	 Miss Burnaby—I'm	afraid	I	was	wrong	to	allow	this—this—"	he	did	not	know	quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	to	say,	so	he	ended	lamely,	"this	séance	to	take	place." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he	poured	out	another	stiff	brandy	and	plain	water	and	drank	it	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Donnington	 turned	 to	 Miss	 Farrow.	 "I	 have	 never	 known	 Bubbles	 so—so</p>
<p class="calibre1">wonderful!"	 he	 exclaimed	 in	 a	 low	 voice.	 "There	 must	 be	 something	 in	 the atmosphere	of	this	place	which	made	it	easier	than	usual." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	Farrow	looked	at	him	searchingly.	"Surely	you	don't	believe	in	it?"	she whispered	 incredulously.	 "Of	 course	 it	 was	 a	 mixture	 of	 thought-reading	 and Bubbles'	usual	quickness!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	agree	with	you—I	wish	I	could."	The	young	man	looked	very	pale	in	the now	bright	light.	"I	thoroughly	disapprove	of	it	all,	Miss	Farrow.	I	wish	to	God	I could	stop	Bubbles	going	in	for	it!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	agree	with	you	that	it's	very	bad	for	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girl	had	gone	away,	right	out	of	the	circle.	She	was	sitting	on	a	chair	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">far	corner	of	the	room;	her	head,	bent	over	a	table,	rested	on	her	arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She'll	be	worn	out—good	for	nothing	to-morrow,"	went	on	Donnington	crossly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She'll	have	an	awful	night	too.	I	might	have	thought	she'd	be	up	to	something	of the	sort!	One	of	the	servants	told	her	to-night	that	this	house	is	haunted.	She'll	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying	all	sorts	of	experiments	if	we	can't	manage	to	stop	her.	It's	the	only	thing</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>Bubbles	really	lives	for	now,	Miss	Farrow." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	afraid	it	is"—Blanche	felt	really	concerned.	What	had	just	taken	place	was utterly	unlike	anything	she	had	ever	imagined.	And	yet—and	yet	it	didn't	amount</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	very	much,	after	all!	The	most	extraordinary	thing	which	had	happened,	to	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind,	was	what	had	been	told	to	old	Miss	Burnaby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then	 all	 at	 once	 she	 remembered—and	 smiled	 an	 inward,	 derisive	 little</p>
<p class="calibre1">smile.	 Why,	 of	 course!	 She	 had	 overheard	 Miss	 Burnaby	 tell	 her	 neighbour	 at dinner	that	as	a	girl	she	had	stayed	a	winter	in	Austria.	How	quick,	how	clever</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	 had	 been—how	 daring,	 too!	 Still,	 deep	 in	 her	 heart,	 she	 was	 glad	 that her	niece	had	not	had	time	to	come	round	to	where	she,	herself,	had	been	sitting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	 knew	 a	 good	 deal	 about	 her	 Aunt	 Blanche,	 and	 it	 certainly	 would	 not have	 been	 very	 pleasant	 had	 the	 child	 made	 use	 of	 her	 knowledge—even	 to	 a slight	 degree....	 Miss	 Farrow	 went	 up	 to	 the	 table	 on	 which	 now	 stood	 a	 large lacquer	tray,	and	poured	herself	out	a	glass	of	cold	water.	She	was	an	abstemious</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	think	some	of	us	ought	to	go	up	to	bed	now"	she	said,	turning	round.	"It	isn't late	yet,	but	I'm	sure	we're	all	tired.	And	we've	had	rather	an	exciting	evening." </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	good	deal	of	hand-shaking,	and	a	little	talk	of	plans	for	the	morrow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	 had	 come	 over,	 and	 joined	 the	 others,	 but	 she	 was	 still	 curiously</p>
<p class="calibre1">abstracted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where's	Mr.	Burnaby?"	she	asked	suddenly.	"Wasn't	he	at	the	séance?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	gone	to	bed,"	said	his	sister	shortly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	host	was	handing	the	old	lady	a	bedroom	candle,	and	she	was	looking	up	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	with	a	kind	of	appeal	in	her	now	troubled	and	bewildered	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 feel	 I	 owe	 you	 an	 apology,"	 he	 said	 in	 a	 low	 voice.	 "Bubbles	 Dunster	 has always	possessed	extraordinary	powers	of	thought-reading.	I	remember	hearing</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 years	 ago,	 when	 she	 was	 a	 child.	 But	 of	 course	 I	 had	 no	 idea	 she	 had developed	the	gift	to	the	extent	she	now	has—or	I	should	have	forbidden	her	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">exercise	it	to-night." </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 the	 three	 other	 women	 had	 all	 gone	 upstairs,	 Blanche	 Farrow	 lingered	 a moment	at	the	bottom	of	the	staircase;	and	Varick,	having	shepherded	Sir	Lyon, </p>
<p class="calibre1">young	 Donnington,	 and	 James	 Tapster	 into	 the	 hall,	 joined	 her	 for	 a	 few</p>
<p class="calibre1">moments. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>"Bubbles	is	an	extraordinary	young	creature,"	he	said	thoughtfully.	"I	shouldn't have	 thought	 it	 within	 the	 power	 of	 any	 human	 being	 to	 impress	 me	 as	 she impressed	me	to-night.	What	a	singular	gift	the	girl	has!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somehow	Blanche	felt	irritated.	"She	has	a	remarkable	memory,"	she	said	dryly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	also	the	devil's	own	impudence,	Lionel."	And	then	she	told	him	of	the	few words	 she	 had	 overheard	 at	 dinner	 of	 the	 winter	 Miss	 Burnaby	 had	 spent	 in Austria	a	matter	of	forty	years	ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	 that's	 all	 very	 well!	 But	 it	 doesn't	 account	 for	 her	 absolutely	 correct description	of	my	mother,	or—or—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes?"	said	his	companion	sharply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well—of	her	mention	of	the	word	'arbour.'	The	last	time	I	saw	my	mother	alive</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	in	the	arbour	of	our	horrible	little	garden	at	Bedford." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That,"	 said	 Blanche	 thoughtfully,	 "was,	 I	 admit,	 pure	 thought-reading.	 Good-night,	Lionel." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	remained	standing	at	the	foot	of	the	staircase	for	quite	a	long	while. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes,	it	had	been	thought-reading,	of	course.	But	very	remarkable,	even	so.	It	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">years	 since	 he	 had	 thought	 of	 that	 last	 painful	 talk	 with	 his	 mother.	 She	 had warned	 him	 very	 seriously	 of	 certain—well,	 peculiarities	 of	 his	 character.	 The long-forgotten	words	she	had	used	suddenly	leapt	into	his	mind	as	if	written	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">letters	of	fire:	"Your	father's	unscrupulousness,	matched	with	my	courage,	make</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	dangerous	combination,	my	boy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 he	 lit	 a	 cigarette,	 his	 hand	 shook	 a	 little,	 but	 the	 more	 he	 thought	 of	 it,	 the more	 he	 told	 himself	 that	 for	 all	 that	 had	 occurred	 with	 relation	 to	 himself	 to-night	there	was	an	absolutely	natural	explanation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Take	 the	 second	 figure	 Bubbles	 had	 described?	 It	 was	 obviously	 that	 of	 the woman	 on	 whom	 he	 had	 allowed	 his	 mind	 to	 dwell	 uneasily,	 intensely,	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1">afternoon.	 She	 was	 his	 only	 enemy—if	 you	 could	 call	 the	 crazy	 creature	 who had	been	poor	Milly's	companion	an	enemy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 odious	 personality	 of	 the	 absurdly	 named	 Julia	 Pigchalke	 was	 still	 very present	 to	 him	 as	 he	 turned	 and	 joined	 his	 men	 guests	 in	 the	 beautiful	 camber-roofed	and	linen-panelled	room	known	as	the	hall.	She	was	the	one	fly,	albeit	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	small	fly,	in	the	ointment	of	his	deep	content. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>
<a id="p44"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	V</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 a	 good	 deal	 more	 than	 an	 hour	 later—in	 fact	 nearer	 twelve	 than	 eleven o'clock—when	 young	 Donnington	 got	 up	 from	 the	 comfortable	 chair	 where	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	been	ensconced,	and	put	down	the	book	which	he	had	been	reading. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	the	other	men	of	the	party,	with	the	exception	of	old	Mr.	Burnaby—who	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">gone	 to	 bed	 for	 good	 after	 his	 dramatic	 bolt	 from	 the	 drawing-room—had</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappeared	some	time	ago.	But	Donnington	had	stayed	on	downstairs,	absorbed</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	a	curious,	privately	printed	book	containing	the	history	of	Wyndfell	Hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly	his	eyes	fell	on	the	following	passage:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Every	 piece	 of	 the	 furniture	 in	 'the	 White	 Parlour,'	 as	 it	 is	 still	 called,	 is	 of historic	 value	 and	 interest.	 To	 take	 but	 one	 example.	 A	 low,	 high-backed	 chair, covered	 with	  <i class="calibre4">petit	 point</i>	 embroidery,	 is	 believed	 to	 have	 been	 the	  <i class="calibre4">prie-dieu</i>	 on which	the	Princesse	de	Lamballe	knelt	during	the	whole	of	the	night	preceding</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 terrible	 death.	 In	 a	 document	 which	 was	 sold	 with	 the	 chair	 in	 1830,	 her servant—who,	it	appears,	had	smuggled	the	chair	into	the	prison—recounts	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">curious	 fact	 that	 the	 poor	 Princess	 had	 a	 prevision	 that	 she	 was	 to	 be	  <i class="calibre4">torn	 in</i> <i class="calibre4">pieces</i>.	She	spent	the	last	night	praying	for	strength	to	bear	the	awful	ordeal	she knew	lay	before	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Donnington	shut	the	book.	"That's	strange!"	he	muttered	to	himself	as	he	got	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	putting	the	book	back	in	the	bookcase	where	he	had	found	it,	he	stood	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	 round	 the	 splendid	 apartment	 with	 a	 mixture	 of	 interest	 and	 delighted attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes,	this	wonderful	old	"post	and	panel"	dwelling	was	the	most	beautiful	of	the many	beautiful	old	country	houses	with	which	he	had	made	acquaintance	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">last	 two	 or	 three	 years;	 and	 it	 was	 awfully	 good	 of	 Bubbles	 to	 have	 got	 him asked	here!	Even	if	she	hadn't	actually	suggested	he	should	come,	he	knew	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	course	he	owed	his	being	here	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	queer,	enigmatic,	clever	girl	had	the	whole	of	Donnington's	steadfast	heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since	 he	 had	 first	 met	 Bubbles—only	 some	 eighteen	 months	 ago,	 but	 it	 now</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>seemed	an	eternity—all	life	had	been	different. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	first	she	had	at	once	repelled,	attracted,	and	shocked	him.	He	had	been	much</p>
<p class="calibre1">taken	 aback	 when	 she	 had	 first	 proposed	 coming	 to	 see	 him,	 unchaperoned,	 in the	 modest	 rooms	 he	 occupied	 in	 Gray's	 Inn.	 Then,	 after	 she	 had	 twice	 invited herself	to	tea,	her	constant	comings	seemed	quite	natural.	Sometimes	she	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	accompanied	by	a	friend,	either	another	girl	or	a	man,	and	they	would	form	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">merry,	happy	little	party	of	three	or	four.	But	of	course	he	was	far,	far	happiest</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	 she	 came	 alone.	 Almost	 from	 the	 first	 moment	 there	 had	 been	 a	 kind	 of instinctive	intimacy	between	them,	and	very	soon	she	had	learnt	to	rely	on	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">—even	 to	 take	 his	 advice	 about	 little	 things—and	 to	 come	 to	 him	 with	 all	 her troubles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	 Dunster	 had	 already	 been	 what	 Donnington	 in	 his	 own	 mind	 called</p>
<p class="calibre1">"deeply	bitten"	with	spiritualism	before	they	had	met;	yet	he	had	known	her	for some	 considerable	 time	 before	 she	 had	 allowed	 him	 to	 know	 it.	 Even	 now	 she tried,	 ineffectually,	 to	 keep	 him	 outside	 all	 that	 concerned	 that	 part	 of	 her	 life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But,	as	he	once	had	told	her	with	more	emotion	than	he	generally	betrayed,	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	have	followed	her	down	to	hell	itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	came	a	cloud	over	his	honest	face	as	he	thought	of	what	had	happened	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	 evening.	 And	 yet,	 and	 yet	 he	 had	 to	 admit	 that	 even	 now	 he	 could	 never make	up	his	mind—he	never	knew,	that	is,	how	far	what	took	place	was	due	to	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">supernatural	 agency,	 or	 how	 much	 to	 Bubbles'	 uncanny	 quickness	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">cleverness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	was	more	strange,	considering	how	well	he	knew	her,	Donnington	did	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">really	 know	 how	 much	 she	 herself	 believed	 in	 it	 all.	 As	 a	 rule—probably</p>
<p class="calibre1">because	she	knew	how	anxious	and	troubled	he	felt	about	the	matter—Bubbles</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	very	seldom	discuss	with	him	any	of	the	strange	happenings	in	which	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 so	 absorbed.	 And	 yet,	 now	 and	 again,	 almost	 as	 if	 in	 spite	 of	 herself,	 she would	ask	him	if	he	would	care	to	come	to	a	séance,	or	invite	him	to	witness	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">exceptionally	remarkable	manifestation	at	some	psychic	friend's	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	had	early	become	impossible	for	him,	apart	from	everything	else,	to	accept	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">easy	 "all	 rot"	 theory,	 for	 Bubbles'	 occult	 gifts	 were	 really	 very	 remarkable	 and striking.	 They	 had	 become	 known	 to	 the	 now	 large	 circle	 of	 intelligent	 people who	make	a	study	of	psychic	phenomena,	and	among	them,	just	because	she	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	"amateur,"	she	was	much	in	request. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	it	had	never	occurred	to	him,	from	what	he	had	been	told	of	the	party	now</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>gathered	 together,	 that	 there	 would	 be	 the	 slightest	 attempt	 at	 the	 sort	 of	 thing which	had	happened	to-night.	He	felt	sharply	irritated	with	Miss	Farrow,	whom</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 had	 never	 liked,	 and	 also	 with	 Lionel	 Varick.	 He	 knew	 that	 Bubbles'	 father had	 written	 to	 her	 aunt;	 he	 had	 himself	 advised	 it,	 knowing,	 with	 that	 shrewd, rather	pathetic	instinct	which	love	gives	to	some	natures,	that	Bubbles	thought	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">great	 deal	 of	 her	 aunt—far	 more,	 indeed,	 than	 her	 aunt	 did	 of	 her.	 He	 told himself	that	he	would	speak	to	Miss	Farrow	to-morrow—have	it	out	with	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rather	 slowly	 and	 deliberately,	 for	 he	 was	 a	 rather	 slow	 and	 deliberate	 young man,	 he	 put	 out	 the	 lights	 of	 the	 three	 seven-branched	 candlesticks	 which</p>
<p class="calibre1">illumined	the	beautiful	old	room;	and,	as	he	moved	about,	he	suddenly	became</p>
<p class="calibre1">aware	that	nearly	opposite	the	door	giving	into	the	staircase	lobby	was	a	finely-</p>
<p class="calibre1">carved,	oak,	confessional-box.	What	an	odd,	incongruous	ornament	to	have	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">living-room! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	last	bedroom	candlestick	had	gone,	and	temporarily	blinded	by	the	sudden</p>
<p class="calibre1">darkness,	he	groped	his	way	up	the	broad,	shallow	stairs	to	the	corridor	which	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew	ultimately	led	to	his	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	setting	his	feet	cautiously	one	before	the	other	on	the	landing,	his	eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	now	accustomed	to	the	grey	dimness	of	a	winter	night,	for	the	great	window</p>
<p class="calibre1">above	 the	 staircase	 was	 uncurtained,	 when	  <i class="calibre4">Something</i>	 suddenly	 loomed	 up before	him,	and	he	felt	his	right	arm	gripped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	gave	a	stifled	cry.	And	then,	all	at	once,	he	knew	that	it	was	Bubbles—only</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles!	He	felt	her	dear	nearness	rushing,	as	it	were,	all	over	him.	It	was	all	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	do	to	prevent	himself	from	taking	her	in	his	arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bill?	That	 <i class="calibre4">is</i>	you,	isn't	it?"	she	asked	in	a	low	whisper.	"I'm	so	frightened—so frightened!	I	should	have	come	down	long	ago—but	I	thought	some	of	the	others</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	still	there.	Oh!	I	wish	I'd	come	down!	I've	been	waiting	up	here	so	long—</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 oh,	 Bill,	 I'm	 very	 cold!"	 She	 was	 pressing	 up	 close	 to	 him,	 and	 he	 put	 his arm	round	her—in	a	protecting,	impersonal	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 wish	 we	 could	 go	 and	 sit	 down	 somewhere,"	 she	 went	 on	 plaintively.	 "It's horrible	talking	out	here,	on	the	landing.	I	suppose	it	wouldn't	do,	Bill,	for	you	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">come	into	my	room?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	 that	 wouldn't	 do	 at	 all,"	 he	 said	 simply.	 "But	 look	 here,	 Bubbles—would you	 like	 to	 go	 downstairs	 again,	 into	 the	 hall?	 It's	 quite	 warm	 there,"—he	 felt that	she	was	really	shivering. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>"I'm	cold—I'm	cold!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Put	on	something	warmer,"	he	said—or	rather	ordered.	"Put	on	your	fur	coat.	Is it	downstairs?	Shall	I	go	and	fetch	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 whispered,	 "It's	 in	 my	 room—I	 know	 where	 it	 is.	 I	 know	 exactly	 where Pegler	put	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	left	him	standing	in	the	corridor,	and	went	back	into	her	room.	The	door	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">wide	open,	and	he	could	see	that	she	was	wearing	a	white	wrapper	covered	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">large	 red	 flowers—some	 kind	 of	 Eastern,	 wadded	 dressing-gown.	 He	 heard	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">cupboard	 door	 creak,	 and	 then	 she	 came	 out	 of	 the	 room	 dragging	 her	 big	 fur coat	 over	 her	 dressing-gown;	 but	 he	 saw	 that	 her	 feet	 were	 bare—she	 had	 not troubled	to	put	on	slippers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Go	back,"	he	said	imperiously,	"and	put	some	shoes	on,	Bubbles—you'll	catch your	death	of	cold." </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	amazing,	how	incredible,	this	adventure	would	have	appeared	to	him	even</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	year	ago!	But	it	seemed	quite	natural	now—simply	wilful	Bubbles'	way.	There</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	nothing	Bubbles	could	do	which	would	surprise	Donnington	 <i class="calibre4">now</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	shut	your	door,"	he	muttered.	"It	might	wake	someone	up.	Just	blow	out the	candles,	and	leave	the	door	open." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 obeyed	 him;	 and	 then	 he	 took	 her	 arm—again	 blinded	 by	 the	 sudden</p>
<p class="calibre1">obscurity	in	which	they	were	now	plunged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 hate	 going	 downstairs,"	 she	 said	 fretfully.	 "Somehow	 I	 feel	 as	 if	 downstairs were	full	of	Them!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Full	of	 <i class="calibre4">them</i>?"	he	repeated.	"What	on	earth	do	you	mean,	Bubbles?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	Bubbles	murmured	fearfully:	"You	know	perfectly	well	what	I	mean.	And</p>
<p class="calibre1">it's	all	my	fault—all	my	fault!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	whispered	rather	sternly	back:	"Yes,	Bubbles,	it	 <i class="calibre4">is</i>	 your	 fault.	 Why	 couldn't you	 leave	 the	 thing	 alone	 just	 for	 a	 little	 while—just	 through	 the	 Christmas holidays?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	felt	so	tempted,"	she	muttered.	"I	forget	who	it	was	who	said	'Temptation	is	so pleasing	because	it	need	never	be	resisted.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>He	uttered	an	impatient	exclamation	under	his	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's	 sit	 down	 on	 the	 staircase,"	 she	 pleaded,	 "I'm	 warmer	 now.	 I	 think	 this would	be	a	nice	place	to	sit	down." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sank	down	on	one	of	the	broad,	low	steps	just	below	the	landing,	and	pulled</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	down,	nestling	up	close	to	him.	"Oh,	Bill,"	she	whispered,	"it	 <i class="calibre4">is</i>	a	comfort	to be	 with	 you—a	 real	 comfort.	 You	 don't	 know	 what	 I've	 gone	 through	 since	 I came	 up	 to	 bed.	 I	 felt	 all	 the	 time	 as	 if	 Something	 was	 trying	 to	 get	 at	 me—</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	cruel,	revengeful,	miserable!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	 ate	 too	 much	 at	 dinner,"	 he	 said	 shortly.	 "You	 oughtn't	 to	 have	 taken	 that brandy-cherries	ice." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	had	very	soon	got	past	the	stage	during	which	Donnington	had	tried	to	say</p>
<p class="calibre1">pretty	things	to	Bubbles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Perhaps	 I	 did"—he	 felt	 the	 gurgle	 of	 amusement	 in	 her	 voice.	 "I	 was	 very hungry,	and	the	food	here	is	very	good.	It	must	be	costing	a	lot	of	money—all</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	sort	of	thing.	How	nice	to	be	rich!	Oh,	Bill,	how	 <i class="calibre4">very</i>	nice	to	be	rich!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	agree,"	he	said	sharply.	"Varick	doesn't	look	particularly	happy,	that	I	can see." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	wonder	if	Aunt	Blanche	would	marry	him	 <i class="calibre4">now</i>?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	suppose	he'd	give	her	the	chance—now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	wasn't	a	very	chivalrous	thing	to	say,	or	hear	said,	and	Bubbles	pinched	him	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">viciously	that	he	nearly	cried	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're	not	to	talk	like	that	of	my	Aunt	Blanche.	Quite	lately—not	three	months</p>
<p class="calibre1">ago—someone	 asked	 her	 to	 marry	 him	 for	 the	 thousandth	 time!	 But	 of	 course</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	said	no—as	I	shall	do	to	you,	a	thousand	times	too,	if	we	live	long	enough." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 waited	 a	 moment,	 then	 said	 slowly:	 "Her	 man's	 rather	 like	 you.	 He's	 very much	 what	 you	 will	 be,	 Bill,	 in	 about	 thirty	 years	 from	 now—a	 plain,	 good, priggish	old	fellow.	Of	course	you	know	who	it	is?	Mark	Gifford,	of	the	Home</p>
<p class="calibre1">Office.	 Aunt	 Blanche	 only	 keeps	 in	 with	 him	 because	 he's	 very	 useful	 to	 her sometimes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	she	added,	with	a	touch	of	strange	cruelty,	"Just	as	 <i class="calibre4">I</i>	shall	always	keep in	with	you,	Bill,	however	tiresome	and	disagreeable	you	may	be!	Just	because	I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>find	you	so	useful.	You're	being	useful	now;	I	don't	feel	frightened	any	more." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	drew	herself	from	the	shelter	of	his	strong,	protecting	arm,	and	slid	along	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">polished	step	till	she	leant	against	the	banister.	He	could	just	see	the	whiteness	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	little	face	shining	out	of	the	big	fur	collar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	you're	feeling	all	right	again,"	he	said	rather	coolly,	"I	think	we'd	both	better go	to	bed.	Speaking	for	myself,	I	feel	sleepy!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 she	 was	 sliding	 towards	 him	 again,	 and	 again	 she	 clutched	 his	 arm.	 "No, no,"	 she	 whispered.	 "Let's	 wait	 just	 a	 little	 longer,	 Bill.	 I—I	 don't	 feel	 quite comfortable	in	that	room.	I	wonder	if	they'd	give	me	a	new	room	to-morrow?	It's</p>
<p class="calibre1">funny,	 I'm	 not	 a	 bit	 frightened	 at	 what	 they	 call	 the	 haunted	 room	 here—the room	 that's	 next	 to	 Aunt	 Blanche's,	 in	 the	 other	 wing	 of	 the	 house.	 A	 woman who	killed	her	little	stepson	is	supposed	to	haunt	that	room." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 know,"	 said	 Donnington	 shortly.	 "I've	 been	 reading	 about	 it	 in	 a	 book downstairs.  <i class="calibre4">I</i>	shouldn't	care	to	sleep	in	a	room	where	such	a	thing	had	been	done</p>
<p class="calibre1">—ghost	or	no	ghost!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then	 Bubbles	 said	 something	 which	 rather	 startled	 him.	 "Bill,"	 she whispered,	leaning	yet	closer	to	him,	"  <i class="calibre4">I</i>	raised	that	ghost	two	nights	ago." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	do	you	mean?"	he	asked	sternly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 mean	 that	 Aunt	 Blanche	 and	 that	 tiresome	 Pegler	 of	 hers	 had	 already	 been here	 a	 week	 and	 nothing	 had	 happened.	 And	 then—the	 first	 night	 I	 was	 in	 the house	the	ghost	appeared!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	shivering	now,	and,	almost	unwillingly,	he	put	his	arm	round	her	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Rot!"	he	exclaimed.	"Don't	let	yourself	think	such	things,	Bubbles—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	know	you	don't	believe	it,	Bill,	but	I	 <i class="calibre4">have</i>	got	the	power	of	raising	Them." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	know	whether	I	believe	it	or	not,"	he	said	slowly.	"And	I—I	sometimes wonder	if	 <i class="calibre4">you</i>	believe	it,	Bubbles,	or	if	you're	only	pretending?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	pause.	And	then	Bubbles	said	in	a	strange	tone:	"'Tisn't	a	question	of believing	it	now,	Bill.	I	 <i class="calibre4">know</i>	it's	true!	I	wish	it	wasn't." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	it's	true,"	he	said,	"or	even	if	you	only	believe	it's	true,	what	on	earth	made you	do	what	you	did	to-night?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>"It	 was	 so	 deadly,"	 she	 exclaimed,	 "so	 deadly	 dull!"	 She	 yawned.	 "You	 see,	 I can't	help	yawning	even	at	the	recollection	of	it!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	in	the	darkness	her	companion	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 felt	 as	 if	 I	 wanted	 to	 wake	 them	 all	 up!	 Also	 I	 felt	 as	 if	 I	 wanted	 to	 know something	more	about	them	than	I	did.	Also"—she	hesitated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes?"	he	said	questioningly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	rather	wanted	to	impress	Aunt	Blanche."	The	words	came	slowly,	reluctantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	wonder	what	made	you	want	to	do	that?"	asked	Donnington	dryly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Somehow—well,	 you	 know,	 Bill,	 that	 sort	 of	 cool	 unbelief	 of	 hers	 stings	 me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She's	always	thought	I	make	it	all	up	as	I	go	along." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	do	sometimes,"	he	said	in	a	low	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	used	to,	Bill—but	I	don't	now:	it	isn't	necessary." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	rather	quickly.	"Honest	Injun,	Bubbles?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes.	 Honest	 Injun!"	 There	 was	 a	 pause.	 "What	 do	 you	 think	 of	 Varick?"	 she suddenly	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	think	 <i class="calibre4">Mr. </i>	Varick,"	answered	Donnington	coldly,	"is	a	thoroughly	nice	sort	of chap.	I	like	his	rather	elaborate,	old-fashioned	manners." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	a	queer	card	for	all	his	pretty	manners,"	muttered	Bubbles;	and	somehow Donnington	felt	that	something	else	was	on	the	tip	of	her	tongue	to	say,	but	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	had	checked	herself,	just	in	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	wish,"	he	said	earnestly,	"I	do	wish,	Bubbles,	that	you	and	I	could	have	a	nice, old-fashioned	 Christmas.	 They	 sent	 up	 to-night	 to	 know	 if	 Mr.	 Varick	 would</p>
<p class="calibre1">allow	some	of	his	holly	to	be	cut	for	decorating	the	church—why	shouldn't	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">go	down	to-morrow	and	help?	Do,	Bubbles—to	please	me!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	will,"	she	said	penitently.	"I	will,	dearest." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Donnington	sighed—a	short,	quick	sigh.	He	could	remember	the	exquisite	thrill</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 had	 given	 him	 when	 she	 had	 first	 uttered	 the	 word—in	 a	 crowd	 of	 careless people.	Now,	when	Bubbles	called	him	"dearest"	it	did	not	thrill	him	at	all,	for he	knew	she	said	it	to	a	great	many	people—and	yet	it	always	gave	him	pleasure</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a>to	hear	her	utter	the	dear,	intimate	little	word	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Get	 up	 and	 go	 to	 bed,	 you	 naughty	 girl!"	 he	 said	 good-humouredly,	 but	 there was	a	great	deal	of	tenderness	in	his	low,	level	tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	rose	quickly	to	her	feet.	All	her	movements	were	quick	and	lightsome	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">free.	There	was	a	touch	of	Ariel	about	Bubbles,	so	Bill	Donnington	sometimes</p>
<p class="calibre1">told	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	walked	up	the	few	shallow	steps	together,	she	still	very	close	to	him.	And</p>
<p class="calibre1">then,	 when	 they	 were	 opposite	 her	 door,	 she	 exclaimed,	 but	 in	 a	 very	 low</p>
<p class="calibre1">whisper:	"Now	you	must	say	the	prayer	with	me—for	me!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	prayer?	What	 <i class="calibre4">do</i>	you	mean,	Bubbles?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	know,"	she	muttered:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Matthew,	Mark,	Luke	and	John, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bless	the	bed	that	I	lie	on—</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's	after	that?"	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	went	on,	uttering	the	quaint	words	very	seriously,	very	reverently:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Four	corners	to	my	bed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Four	Angels	round	my	head; </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	to	watch	and	one	to	pray, </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	to	keep	all	fears	away"—</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	she	exclaimed	fretfully.	"'One	to	keep	my	soul	in	bed.'	That's	what	 <i class="calibre4">I</i>	say.	I don't	want	my	poor	little	soul	to	go	wandering	about	this	beautiful,	terrible	old</p>
<p class="calibre1">house	when	I'm	asleep.	Good-night,	Goody	goody!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	put	up	her	face	as	a	child	might	have	done,	and	he	bent	down	and	kissed	her, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	he	might	have	kissed	a	wilful,	naughty	child	who	had	just	told	him	she	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">sorry	for	something	she	had	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"God	bless	you,"	he	said	huskily.	"God	bless	and	keep	you	from	any	real	harm, Bubbles	my	darling." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	VI</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 regarded	 Lionel	 Varick,	 the	 second	 day	 of	 his	 house-party	 at	 Wyndfell	 Hall opened	most	inauspiciously,	for,	when	approaching	the	dining-room,	he	became</p>
<p class="calibre1">aware	 that	 the	 door	 was	 not	 really	 closed,	 and	 that	 Mr.	 Burnaby	 and	 his	 niece were	having	what	seemed	to	be	an	animated	and	even	angry	discussion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	like	this	place,	and	I	don't	care	for	your	fine	friend,	Mr.	Varick—"	Such was	the	very	unpleasant	observation	which	the	speaker's	unlucky	host	overheard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 came	 instant	 silence	 when	 he	 pushed	 open	 the	 door,	 and	 Helen	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">heightened	 colour	 looked	 up,	 and	 exclaimed:	 "My	 uncle	 has	 to	 go	 back	 to London	 this	 morning.	 Isn't	 it	 unfortunate?	 He's	 had	 a	 letter	 from	 an	 old	 friend who	 hasn't	 been	 in	 England	 for	 some	 years,	 and	 he	 feels	 he	 must	 go	 up	 and spend	Christmas	with	 <i class="calibre4">him</i>,	instead	of	staying	with	us	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	 was	 much	 taken	 aback.	 He	 didn't	 believe	 in	 the	 old	 friend.	 His	 mind	 at once	 reverted	 to	 what	 had	 happened	 the	 night	 before.	 It	 was	 the	 séance	 which had	upset	Mr.	Burnaby—not	a	doubt	of	it!	Without	being	exactly	unpleasant,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">guest's	manner	this	morning	was	cold,	very	cold—and	Varick	himself	was	hard</p>
<p class="calibre1">put	to	it	to	hide	his	annoyance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 had	 taken	 a	 great	 deal	 of	 trouble	 in	 the	 last	 few	 months	 to	 conciliate	 this queer,	disagreeable,	rather	suspicious	old	gentleman,	and	he	had	thought	he	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">succeeded.	 The	 words	 he	 had	 overheard	 when	 approaching	 the	 dining-room</p>
<p class="calibre1">showed	 how	 completely	 he	 had	 failed.	 And	 now	 Bubbles	 Dunster,	 with	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">stupid	tomfoolery,	was	actually	driving	Mr.	Burnaby	away! </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 Mr.	 Burnaby's	 host	 was	 far	 too	 well	 used	 to	 conceal	 his	 thoughts,	 and	 to command	 his	 emotions,	 to	 do	 more	 than	 gravely	 assent,	 with	 an	 expression	 of regret.	 Nay	 more,	 as	 some	 of	 the	 others	 gradually	 lounged	 in,	 and	 as	 the	 meal became	a	trifle	more	animated,	he	told	himself	that	after	all	Mr.	Burnaby	might</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 turned	 out	 a	 spoil-sport,	 especially	 with	 regard	 to	 a	 secret,	 all-important matter	 which	 he,	 the	 convener	 of	 this	 curiously	 assorted	 Christmas	 party,	 had very	much	at	heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>Even	so,	for	the	first	time	in	their	long	friendship,	he	felt	at	odds	with	Blanche Farrow.	 She	 ought	 to	 have	 stopped	 the	 séance	 the	 moment	 she	 saw	 whither	 it was	 tending!	 His	 own	 experience	 of	 Bubbles'	 peculiar	 gift	 had	 been	 very	 far from	agreeable,	and	had	given	him	a	thoroughly	bad	night.	That	strange,	sinister</p>
<p class="calibre1">evocation	of	his	long-dead	mother	had	stirred	embers	Varick	had	believed	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">long	 dead—embers	 he	 had	 done	 his	 best,	 as	 it	 were,	 to	 stamp	 out	 from	 his memory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	thing	which	added	to	his	ill-humour	was	the	fact	that	Bubbles,	alone	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	party,	had	not	come	down	to	breakfast.	In	such	matters	she	was	an	absolute</p>
<p class="calibre1">law	 unto	 herself;	 but	 whereas	 during	 the	 first	 two	 days	 of	 the	 girl's	 stay	 at Wyndfell	Hall	her	host	had	been	rather	glad	to	miss	her	at	breakfast—it	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	cosy	little	meal	shared	by	him	and	Blanche—he	now	resented	her	absence.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">told	 himself	 angrily	 that	 she	 ought	 to	 have	 been	 there	 to	 help	 to	 entertain everybody,	and	to	cheer	up	sulky	James	Tapster.	The	latter	had	asked:	"Where's</p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	 Bubbles?"	 with	 an	 injured	 air—as	 if	 he	 thought	 she	 ought	 to	 be	 forming part	of	the	excellent	breakfast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	 Burnaby	 was	 determined	 to	 get	 away	 from	 Wyndfell	 Hall	 as	 soon	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible,	 and	 by	 eleven	 o'clock	 the	 whole	 party,	 excepting	 Bubbles,	 was	 in	 the hall,	bidding	him	good-bye.	And	then	it	was	that	Varick	suddenly	realized	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">satisfaction	 that	 both	 Miss	 Burnaby	 and	 Helen	 regarded	 the	 departure	 of	 their kinsman	with	perfect	equanimity.	Was	it	possible	that	Helen	was	 <i class="calibre4">glad</i>	her	uncle and	guardian	was	leaving	her	alone—for	once?	The	thought	was	a	very	pleasant</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	to	her	present	entertainer	and	host. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	 so,	 after	 he	 and	 Blanche	 Farrow	 turned	 away	 from	 the	 porch	 where	 they had	 been	 speeding	 the	 parting	 guest,	 she	 noticed	 that	 Varick	 looked	 more</p>
<p class="calibre1">annoyed,	 more	 thoroughly	 put	 out,	 than	 she	 had	 ever	 seen	 him—and	 she	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">seen	 him	 through	 some	 rather	 bad	 moments	 in	 the	 long	 course	 of	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1">friendship! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 hope	 Bubbles	 won't	 try	 on	 any	 more	 of	 her	 thought-reading	 tomfoolery,"	 he said	disagreeably.	"What	happened	last	night	has	driven	Mr.	Burnaby	away." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	think	you're	wrong,"	said	Blanche	quickly.	"I'm	certain	he	received	the	letter of	which	he	spoke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	agree	with	you";	and	it	was	with	difficulty	that	Varick	restrained	himself from	telling	her	what	he	had	overheard	the	unpleasant	old	man	say	to	his	niece. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>"I	think	we	shall	get	on	all	the	better	without	him,"	said	Blanche	decidedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 vaguely	 resented	 the	 way	 in	 which	 Varick	 spoke	 of	 Bubbles.	 After	 all,	 the girl	had	come	to	Wyndfell	Hall	out	of	the	purest	good	nature—in	order	to	help</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	through	with	their	party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	well,	I	daresay	you're	right."	(He	couldn't	afford	to	quarrel	with	Blanche.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	I	forgot	one	thing.	I've	heard	from	Panton—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	mean	your	doctor	friend?"	she	said	coldly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	and	he	hopes	to	be	here	sooner	than	he	thought	he	could	be.	He's	a	good</p>
<p class="calibre1">chap,	Blanche"—there	came	a	note	of	real	feeling	into	Varick's	voice—"awfully hard-worked!	I	hope	we'll	be	able	to	give	him	a	good	time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He'll	have	to	sleep	in	the	haunted	room." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	won't	matter.	He	wouldn't	believe	in	a	ghost,	even	if	he	saw	one!	Be	nice</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	him,	for	my	sake;	he	was	awfully	good	to	me,	Blanche." </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	Blanche	Farrow	softened.	There	was	a	very	good	side	to	her	friend	Lionel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 was	 one	 of	 those	 rare	 human	 beings	 who	 are,	 in	 a	 moral	 sense,	 greatly benefited	by	prosperity.	In	old	days,	though	his	attractive,	dominant	personality</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	brought	him	much	kindness,	and	even	friendship,	of	a	useful	kind,	his	hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	always	been,	as	Blanche	Farrow	knew	well,	more	or	less	against	every	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	now?—now	he	seemed	to	look	at	the	world	through	rose-coloured	glasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 glanced	 at	 the	 still	 very	 attractive	 woman	 standing	 by	 his	 side,	 his	 good-humour	quite	restored.	"A	penny	for	your	thoughts!"	he	said	jokingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	shook	her	head,	smiling.	Not	for	very	much	more	than	a	penny	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	have	told	him	the	thought	that	had	suddenly	come,	as	such	thoughts	will	do, </p>
<p class="calibre1">into	 her	 mind.	 That	 thought	 was,	 how	 extraordinary	 had	 been	 Varick's</p>
<p class="calibre1">transformation	from	what	a	censorious	world	might	have	called	an	unscrupulous</p>
<p class="calibre1">adventurer	into	a	generous	man	of	position	and	substance—all	owing	to	the	fact</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	some	two	years	ago	he	had	drifted	across	an	unknown	woman	in	a	foreign</p>
<p class="calibre1">hotel! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	 to	 Blanche	 there	 was	 something	 pathetic	 in	 the	 thought	 of	 "poor	 Milly," </p>
<p class="calibre1">whose	 birthplace	 and	 home	 this	 beautiful	 and	 strangely	 perfect	 old	 house	 had been.	 It	 was	 Milly—not	 that	 sinister	 figure	 that	 Pegler	 thought	 she	 had	 seen—</p>
<p class="calibre1">whose	 form	 ought	 to	 haunt	 Wyndfell	 Hall.	 But	 there	 survived	 no	 trace,	 no</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>trifling	memento	even,	of	the	dead	woman's	evidently	colourless	personality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	as	if	Varick	had	guessed	part	of	what	was	passing	through	her	mind,	"Any</p>
<p class="calibre1">news	 of	 the	 ghost,	 Blanche?"	 he	 asked	 jokingly.	 "How's	 my	 friend	 Pegler	 this morning?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pegler's	quite	all	right!	I'm	the	person	who	ought	to	have	seen	the	ghost—but	of course	I	neither	saw	nor	heard	anything." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 they	 came	 through	 into	 the	 hall	 where	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 party	 were	 gathered together,	Blanche	heard	Helen	Brabazon	exclaim:	"This	is	a	most	wonderful	old</p>
<p class="calibre1">book,	Mr.	Varick!	It	gives	such	a	curious	account	of	a	ghost	who	is	supposed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">haunt	 this	 house—the	 ghost	 of	 a	 most	 awfully	 wicked	 woman	 who	 killed	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">stepson	by	throwing	him	into	the	moat,	and	then	drowned	herself—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Tapster,	who	seldom	contributed	anything	worth	hearing	to	the	conversation, </p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly	remarked:	"The	ghost	has	been	seen	within	the	last	two	days	by	one	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	servants	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who	told	you	that?"	asked	Varick	sharply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My	valet;	I	always	hear	all	the	news	from	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	 clapped	 her	 hands.	 "How	 splendid!"	 she	 cried.	 "That	 makes	 everything simply	 perfect!"	 She	 turned	 her	 eager,	 smiling	 face	 on	 Lionel	 Varick,	 "I've always	longed	to	stay	in	a	haunted	house.	I	wish	the	ghost	would	appear	to	me!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	wish	that,	Miss	Brabazon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	Sir	Lyon's	quiet	voice	which	uttered	those	five	words	very	gravely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	 Lyon	 liked	 Helen	 Brabazon.	 She	 was	 the	 only	 one	 of	 the	 party,	 with	 the exception	of	Bill	Donnington,	whom	he	did	like.	He	was	puzzled,	however,	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 apparent	 intimacy	 with	 their	 attractive	 host.	 How	 and	 where	 could	 Varick have	 come	 across	 the	 Burnabys	 and	 their	 niece?	 They	 had	 nothing	 in	 common</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	his	usual	associates	and	surroundings.	In	their	several	ways	they	were	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">beings	from	different	planets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Lyon	knew	a	great	deal	about	Lionel	Varick,	though	he	had	seen	nothing	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	 during	 the	 few	 months	 Varick's	 married	 life	 had	 lasted.	 Like	 Miss	 Farrow, Sir	 Lyon	 was	 honestly	 glad	 that	 his	 present	 host,	 after	 turning	 some	 dangerous corners,	 had	 drifted,	 by	 an	 amazing	 series	 of	 lucky	 bumps,	 into	 so	 safe	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>pleasant	a	haven.	There	are	certain	people,	who,	when	unsatisfied,	and	baulked of	whatever	may	be	their	hidden	desires,	are	dangerous	to	their	fellows.	Such	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">man,	Sir	Lyon	was	secretly	convinced,	had	been	Lionel	Varick.	Such,	evidently, </p>
<p class="calibre1">was	he	no	longer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Would	you	like	to	see	the	haunted	room?"	He	heard	Varick	ask	the	question	in that	deep,	musical	voice	which	many	people	found	so	attractive.	Helen	eagerly</p>
<p class="calibre1">assented,	and	they	disappeared	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	 Lyon	 and	 Bill	 Donnington	 went	 off	 to	 the	 library,	 and	 for	 a	 few	 moments Blanche	Farrow	and	Miss	Burnaby	were	alone	together	in	the	hall.	"Your	niece</p>
<p class="calibre1">seems	to	have	very	remarkable	psychic	gifts,"	said	the	old	lady	hesitatingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 Blanche	 suddenly	 remembered—Why,	 of	 course!	 Miss	 Burnaby	 had	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	of	the	people	most	strongly	affected	by	what	had	happened	the	night	before; </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 must	 choose	 her	 words	 carefully.	 So,	 "Bubbles	 has	 a	 remarkable	 gift	 of thought-reading,"	 she	 answered	 quietly.	 "Personally	 I	 am	 quite	 convinced	 that it's	not	anything	more." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are	 you?"	 There	 was	 a	 curious,	 questioning	 look	 on	 Miss	 Burnaby's	 usually placid	 face.	 "D'you	 think	 then,	 that	 what	 happened	 last	 night	 was	  <i class="calibre4">all</i>	 thought-reading?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Certainly	I	think	so!	But	I	admit	that	perhaps	I	am	not	a	fair	judge,	for	I	haven't the	slightest	belief	in	what	Bubbles	would	call	occultism." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	know	a	lady	who	goes	in	for	all	that	sort	of	thing,"	said	Miss	Burnaby	slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My	brother	disapproves	of	my	acquaintance	with	her.	She	once	took	me	to	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 called	 a	 Circle,	 and,	 of	 course,	 I	 could	 not	 help	 feeling	 interested.	 But	 the medium	who	was	there	was	not	nearly	as	remarkable	as	Miss	Dunster	seems	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be;	I	mean	she	did	not	get	the	same	results—at	any	rate,	not	in	my	case." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	 afraid	 what	 happened	 last	 night	 rather	 upset	 you,"	 said	 Blanche uncomfortably.	"I	know	it	would	have	annoyed	me	very	much	if	the	same	thing</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	happened	to	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	 is	 true	 that	 I	 was,	 as	 a	 girl,	 engaged	 to	 an	 Austrian	 officer.	 We	 were	 very devoted	to	one	another,	but	my	dear	father	refused	his	consent.	So	what	occurred</p>
<p class="calibre1">last	night	brought	back	many	painful	memories." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	 Burnaby	 spoke	 very	 simply,	 but	 there	 was	 a	 note	 of	 deep	 sadness	 in	 her voice,	 and	 Blanche	 told	 herself	 that	 she	 had	 been	 wrong	 in	 regarding	 her	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>simply	a	dull,	conventional,	greedy	old	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	very	sorry	now	that	I	allowed	Bubbles	to	do	it,"	she	exclaimed.	"I'm	afraid it	upset	your	brother,	too,	very	much?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again	 there	 came	 a	 curious	 change	 over	 Miss	 Burnaby's	 face.	 She	 hesitated</p>
<p class="calibre1">perceptibly—and	 then	 answered:	 "I	 would	 not	 say	 so	 to	 any	 of	 the	 younger people	here,	of	course.	But,	as	a	matter	of	fact,	my	brother	had	a	very	unpleasant</p>
<p class="calibre1">experience	 as	 a	 young	 man.	 He	 fell	 in	 love,	 or	 thought	 he	 fell	 in	 love,	 with	 a young	woman.	It	was	a	very	unfortunate	and	tragic	affair—for,	Miss	Farrow,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">unhappy	young	person	killed	herself!	I	was	very	young	at	the	time,	and	I	was	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">supposed	to	know	anything	about	it.	But	of	course	I	did	know.	Poor	Ted	had	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">give	evidence	at	the	inquest.	It	was	dreadful,  <i class="calibre4">dreadful</i>!	We	have	never	spoken	of it	all	these	many	years	we	have	lived	together.	You	realize,	Miss	Farrow,	that	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">young	person	was	not	in	our	class	of	life?"—the	old	lady	drew	herself	up	stiffly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	felt	much	relieved	when,	at	that	moment	Bubbles	appeared.	She	made	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">delightful,	 brilliant,	 Goya-like	 picture,	 in	 her	 yellow	 jumper	 and	 long	 chain	 of coral	beads.	But	she	looked	very	tired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Have	all	the	others	gone	out?"	she	asked	languidly.	And	before	Blanche	could answer,	 Miss	 Burnaby,	 murmuring	 something	 about	 having	 letters	 to	 write, </p>
<p class="calibre1">quickly	 left	 the	 room.	 The	 sight	 of	 the	 girl	 affected	 her	 painfully;	 but	 it	 also intensified	her	longing	for	what	she	had	heard	called	"a	private	sitting." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lionel	is	showing	Miss	Brabazon	over	the	house.	She's	very	much	thrilled	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pegler's	experience.	I	can't	make	that	girl	out—can	you,	Bubbles?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Farrow	drew	nearer	to	the	fire.	"She's	such	a	queer	mixture	of	shrewdness</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	simplicity,"	she	went	on.	"She	doesn't	seem	ever	to	have	gone	anywhere,	or seen	anyone,	and	yet	she's	so—so	mature!	I	believe	she's	exactly	your	age." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	feel	about	a	hundred	to-day,"	said	Bubbles	wearily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	 was	 wondering	 how	 she	 could	 open	 on	 the	 subject	 about	 which	 she'd</p>
<p class="calibre1">promised	to	speak	to	the	girl.	Somehow	she	always	very	much	disliked	speaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 Bubbles	 of	 what	 she	 called,	 in	 her	 own	 mind,	 "all	 that	 unhealthy	 rot	 and nonsense!"	And	yet	she	must	say	something—she	had	promised	Lionel	Varick	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles'	next	words	gave	her	no	opening. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>"I	 have	 no	 use	 for	 Helen	 Brabazon,"	 she	 said	 pettishly.	 "A	 very	 little	 of	 her would	bore	me	to	death.	But	still,	I	amused	myself	at	dinner	last	night	thinking</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	I	should	do	if	I	had	all	her	money." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	her	money?"	repeated	Blanche,	puzzled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	you	know	that	she's	one	of	the	richest	girls	in	England?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	 that	 really	 true?"—Blanche	 felt	 surprised,	 and	 more	 than	 surprised,	 keenly interested.	"How	d'you	know,	Bubbles?	Lionel	never	told	me—." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	gave	a	quick,	queer	look	at	her	aunt.	"Mr.	Tapster	told	me	all	about	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">last	night,"	she	answered.	"I	suppose	because	he's	so	rich	himself	he	takes	a	kind of	morbid	interest	in	other	rich	people.	He	said	that	she's	the	owner	of	one	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">biggest	metal-broking	businesses—whatever	that	may	mean—in	the	world.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 uncle	 and	 aunt	 have	 never	 allowed	 her	 to	 know	 anyone	 or	 to	 see	 anyone outside	 their	 own	 tiresome,	 fuggy	 old	 lot.	 They've	 a	 perfect	 terror	 of	 fortune-hunters,	 it	 seems.	 The	 poor	 girl's	 hardly	 ever	 spoken	 to	 a	 man—not	 to	 what	  <i class="calibre4">I</i> should	call	a	man!	I'm	surprised	they	allowed	her	to	come	here.	I	heard	her	tell</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Lyon	last	night	at	dinner	that	this	was	the	first	time	she'd	ever	paid	what	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">called	 a	 country	 visit.	 Apparently	 Harrogate	 or	 Brighton	 is	 those	 awful	 old people's	idea	of	a	pleasant	change.	Up	to	now	Miss	Helen's	own	idea	of	heaven</p>
<p class="calibre1">seems	to	have	been	Strathpeffer." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	very	strange!"	But	Blanche	Farrow	was	not	thinking	of	Helen	Brabazon's</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible	idea	of	heaven	as	she	uttered	the	three	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	 chuckled.	 "I	 touched	 the	 old	 gentleman	 up	 a	 bit	 yesterday,	 didn't	 I, Blanche?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	gave	her	aunt	the	opportunity	for	which	she	was	seeking.	"You	did!	And	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 result	 he	 made	 up	 some	 cock-and-bull	 excuse	 and	 went	 back	 to	 London	 this morning.	Lionel	is	very	much	put	out	about	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 should	 have	 thought	 Lionel	 would	 have	 been	 glad,"	 said	 Bubbles,	 and	 there came	into	her	voice	the	touch	of	slight,	almost	insolent,	contempt	with	which	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">generally	spoke	of	Lionel	Varick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	was	very	far	from	glad;	he	was	furious,"	said	Blanche	gravely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 only	 did	 it	 because	 he	 said	 he	 wanted	 his	 guests	 entertained,"	 said	 Bubbles sulkily. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a>And	 then,	 after	 there	 had	 been	 a	 rather	 long	 silence	 between	 them,	 she	 asked:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	 did	  <i class="calibre4">you</i>	 think	 of	 it,	 Blanche?	 You'd	 never	 been	 at	 a	 séance	 before,	 had you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Farrow	hesitated.	"Of	course	I	was	impressed,"	she	acknowledged.	"I	kept wondering	 how	 you	 did	 it.	 I	 mean	 that	 I	 kept	 wondering	 how	 those	 people's thoughts	were	conveyed	to	your	brain." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	 you	 didn't	 believe	 that	 I	 saw	 anything	 of	 the	 things	 I	 said	 I	 saw?"	 said Bubbles	slowly.	"You	thought	it	was	all	fudge	on	my	part?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	aunt	reddened.	"I	don't	quite	know	what	you	mean	by	saying	that.	Of	course</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	don't	believe	you	saw	the—the	figures	you	described	so	clearly.	But	I	realized</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	in	some	queer	way	you	must	have	got	hold	of	 <i class="calibre4">the	memory</i>	of	your	victims. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lionel	admits	that	you	did	so	in	his	case." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Does	he	indeed?"	Bubbles	spoke	with	sharp	sarcasm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	rose	before	her	a	vision	of	her	host's	pale,	startled	face.	In	some	ways	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 been	 the	 most	 inwardly	 perturbed	 of	 her	 last	 night's	 sitters,	 and	 she,	 the medium,	had	been	well	aware	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	wonder,"	she	said	suddenly	and	inconsequently,	"if	Lionel	has	some	enemy—I mean	a	woman—in	his	life,	of	whom	his	friends	know	nothing?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	 looked	 dubiously	 at	 the	 girl.	 "That's	 the	 sort	 of	 thing	 one	 can	 never know	about	a	man,"	she	said	slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 woman	 I	 mean"—Bubbles	 was	 going	 on	 rather	 quickly	 and	 breathlessly now—"is	not	a	young	woman.	She's	about	sixty,	I	should	think.	She	has	a	plain, </p>
<p class="calibre1">powerful	face,	with	a	lot	of	grey	hair	turned	off	her	forehead." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Have	you	ever	seen	such	a	person	with	Lionel?"	asked	Miss	Farrow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	not	exactly." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	 <i class="calibre4">do</i>	you	mean,	Bubbles?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	can't	quite	explain	what	I	mean.	Even	before	the	séance	I	seemed	to	 <i class="calibre4">feel</i>	 her last	night.	I	suppose	 <i class="calibre4">you</i>	would	say	I	saw	her	in	his	mind—in	what	some	people</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	call	his	inner	consciousness." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	stared	at	the	girl	uncomfortably.	"D'you	mean	you	can	always	see	what</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a>people	are	thinking	of?"	she	exclaimed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	 burst	 out	 laughing.	 "Of	 course	 I	 can't!	 You	 needn't	 feel	 nervous."	 She went	 up	 to	 her	 aunt,	 and	 thrust	 her	 hand	 through	 the	 other's	 arm.	 "Don't	 be worried,	 old	 thing"—she	 spoke	 very	 affectionately.	 "I've	 promised	 Bill	 that	 I'll put	 everything	 of	 the	 kind	 he	 and	 father	 disapprove	 of	 away—just	 while	 I'm here!	But	still,	Blanche—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	 Farrow	 had	 never	 seen	 the	 girl	 in	 this	 serious,	 thoughtful	 mood	 before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,"	she	said.	"Yes,	Bubbles?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	well,	I	only	just	wanted	to	quote	something	to	you	that's	rather	hackneyed." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hackneyed?"	repeated	Miss	Farrow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	are	more	things	in	heaven	and	earth,	my	dear,	than	are	dreamt	of	in	 <i class="calibre4">your</i> philosophy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	Farrow	felt	a	little	piqued.	"I've	never	doubted	that,"	she	said	curtly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	VII</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile,	one	of	the	subjects	of	their	discussion	was	thoroughly	enjoying	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">tour	 of	 Wyndfell	 Hall;	 and	 as	 she	 entered	 each	 of	 the	 curious,	 stately	 rooms upstairs	 and	 down,	 Helen	 Brabazon	 uttered	 an	 exclamation	 of	 pleasure	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather	naïve	admiration.	Not	a	corner	or	a	passage-way	but	had	some	fine	piece</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 old	 furniture,	 some	 exquisite	 needle-picture	 or	 panel	 of	 tapestry,	 in	 keeping with	the	general	character	of	the	ancient	dwelling	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 cicerone	 would	 have	 enjoyed	 their	 progress	 more	 had	 it	 not	 been	 that	 his companion	frequently	referred	to	his	late	wife.	"How	strange	that	Milly	did	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">love	this	wonderful	old	house!"	she	exclaimed.	And	then,	when	they	had	gone	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	 further	 on,	 she	 suddenly	 asked:	 "I	 wish	 you'd	 tell	 me	 which	 was	 Milly's room?	Surely	she	must	have	been	happy	here	sometimes!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 the	 new	 master	 of	 Wyndfell	 Hall	 had	 never	 even	 thought	 of	 asking	 which had	been	his	wife's	room.	And,	on	seeing	the	troubled,	embarrassed	look	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">crossed	his	face	while	he	confessed	his	ignorance,	Helen	felt	sharply	sorry	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 had	 asked	 the	 question.	 To	 his	 relief,	 she	 spoke	 no	 more	 of	 Milly,	 and	 of Milly's	association	with	the	house	which	so	charmed	and	attracted	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	 of	 the	 strangest,	 most	 disturbing	 facts	 about	 our	 complex	 human	 nature	 is how	 very	 little	 we	 know	 of	 what	 is	 passing	 in	 another's	 mind.	 Helen	 Brabazon would	 have	 been	 amazed	 indeed	 had	 she	 seen	 even	 only	 a	 very	 little	 way	 into her	 present	 companion's	 secret	 thoughts.	 How	 surprised	 she	 would	 have	 been, </p>
<p class="calibre1">for	instance,	to	know	that	the	only	thing	about	herself	Varick	would	have	liked</p>
<p class="calibre1">altered	was	her	association	with	that	part	of	his	life	to	which	he	never	willingly</p>
<p class="calibre1">returned,	even	in	his	thoughts.	The	part	of	his	life,	that	is,	which	had	been	spent</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	 his	 dying	 wife	 and	 himself	 at	 Redsands.	 It	 was	 with	 nervous	 horror	 that	 he unwillingly	 recalled	 any	 incident,	 however	 slight,	 connected	 with	 those	 tragic weeks.	And	yet	Helen,	had	she	been	asked,	would	have	said	that	he	must	often</p>
<p class="calibre1">dwell	on	them	in	loving	retrospect.	She	honestly	believed	that	the	link	between</p>
<p class="calibre1">them,	even	now,	was	a	survival	of	what	had	been	their	mutual	affection	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">then	 dying	 woman,	 and	 the	 touching	 dependence	 that	 same	 woman	 had	 shown</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	their	joint	love	and	care. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>As	they	wandered	on	together,	apparently	on	the	most	happily	intimate	terms	of liking	 and	 of	 friendship,	 about	 the	 delightful	 old	 house,	 there	 was	 scarce	 a thought	 in	 Lionel	 Varick's	 mind	 that	 would	 not	 have	 surprised,	 disturbed,	 and puzzled	his	companion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	one	thing,	he	was	looking	at	Helen	Brabazon	far	more	critically	than	he	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	 at	 any	 woman	 for	 a	 very	 long	 time,	 telling	 himself,	 rather	 ruefully	 the while,	 that	 she	 was	 not	 the	 type	 of	 girl	 that	 at	 any	 time	 of	 his	 life	 would	 have naturally	attracted	him.	But	he	was	well	aware	that	this	was	his	misfortune,	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	fault;	and	he	did	like	her—he	did	respect	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	 strange	 it	 was	 to	 know	 that	 in	 her	 well-shaped	 little	 hand	 there	 lay	 such immense	potential	power!	Varick	fully	intended	that	that	little	hand	should	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">day,	sooner	rather	than	later,	lie,	confidingly,	in	his.	And	when	that	happened	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">intended	to	behave	very	well.	He	would	"make	good,"	as	our	American	cousins</p>
<p class="calibre1">call	 it;	 he	 would	 go	 into	 public	 life,	 maybe,	 and	 make	 a	 big	 name	 for	 himself, and,	incidentally,	for	her.	What	might	he	not	do,	indeed—with	Helen	Brabazon's</p>
<p class="calibre1">vast	fortune	joined	to	her	impeccable	good	name!	He	did	not	wish	to	give	up	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">own	 old	 family	 name;	 but	 why	 should	 they	 not	 become	 the	 Brabazon-Varicks? </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	far	had	he	actually	travelled	in	his	own	mind,	as	he	escorted	his	young	lady</p>
<p class="calibre1">guest	about	the	upper	rooms	and	corridors	of	Wyndfell	Hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	glanced,	now	and	again,	at	the	girl	walking	composedly	by	his	side,	he	felt</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 would	 have	 given	 anything— <i class="calibre4">anything</i>—to	 have	 known	 what	 was	 behind</p>
<p class="calibre1">those	candid	hazel	eyes,	that	broad	white	brow.	Again	he	was	playing	for	a	great</p>
<p class="calibre1">stake,	and	playing,	this	time,	more	or	less	in	the	dark.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 mind	 and	 memory	 swung	 back,	 in	 spite	 of	 himself,	 to	 his	 late	 wife.	 Milly Fauncey	had	liked	him	almost	from	the	first	day	they	had	met.	It	had	been	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 attraction—but	 of	 course	 that	 was	 the	 very	 last	 simile	 that	 would	 have occurred	to	Varick	himself—of	a	rabbit	for	a	cobra.	He	had	had	but	to	look	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">self-absorbed,	shy,	diffident	human	being,	to	fascinate	and	draw	her	to	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	task	would	have	been	almost	too	easy,	but	for	the	dominant	personality	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">poor	Milly's	companion,	Julia	Pigchalke.	She	had	fought	against	him,	tooth	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">claw;	 but,	 cunning	 old	 Dame	 Nature	 had	 been	 on	 his	 side	 in	 the	 fight,	 and,	 of course,	Nature	had	won. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	 Pigchalke	 had	 always	 made	 the	 fatal	 mistake	 of	 keeping	 her	 ex-pupil	 too much	to	herself.	And	during	a	certain	fatal	three	days	when	the	companion	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	confined	to	her	hotel	bedroom	by	a	bad	cold,	the	friendship	of	shy,	nervous</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p63"></a>Milly	 Fauncey,	 and	 of	 bold,	 confident	 Lionel	 Varick,	 had	 fast	 ripened,	 fostered by	 the	 romantic	 Italian	 atmosphere.	 During	 these	 three	 days	 Varick,	 almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">without	 trying	 to	 do	 so,	 had	 learnt	 all	 there	 was	 to	 learn	 of	 the	 simple-minded spinster	and	of	her	financial	circumstances.	But	he	was	not	the	man	to	take	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">risk,	and	he	had	actually	paid	a	flying	visit	to	London—a	visit	of	which	he	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">later	 had	 the	 grace	 to	 feel	 secretly	 ashamed—for	 it	 had	 had	 for	 object	 that	 of making	 quite	 sure,	 at	 Somerset	 House,	 that	 Miss	 Fauncey's	 account	 of	 herself was	absolutely	correct. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes,	the	wooing	of	Milly	Fauncey	had	been	almost	too	easy,	and	he	knew	that	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	not	likely	to	be	so	fortunate	this	time.	But	now	the	prize	to	be	won	was	such</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	infinitely	greater	prize! </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	told	himself	that	he	mustn't	be	impatient.	This,	after	all,	was	only	the	second</p>
<p class="calibre1">day	of	Helen	Brabazon's	stay	at	Wyndfell	Hall.	Perhaps	it	was	a	good	thing	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 cantankerous	 old	 uncle	 had	 betaken	 himself	 off.	 Misfortune	 had	 a	 way	 of turning	itself	into	good	fortune	where	Lionel	Varick	was	concerned;	for	he	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">bold	and	brave,	as	well	as	always	ready	to	seize	opportunity	at	the	flood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When,	 at	 last,	 they	 had	 almost	 finished	 their	 tour	 of	 the	 house,	 and	 he	 was showing	her	into	the	haunted	room,	she	clapped	her	hands	delightedly.	"This	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">exactly	 the	 sort	 of	 room	 in	 which	 one	 would	 expect	 to	 meet	 a	 ghost!"	 she exclaimed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 room	 into	 which	 she	 had	 just	 been	 ushered	 had,	 in	 very	 truth,	 a	 strange, unused,	haunted	look.	Very	different	from	that	into	which	Helen	had	just	peeped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 Miss	 Farrow's	 present	 bed-chamber,	 with	 its	 tapestried	 and	 panelled	 walls, its	red	brocaded	curtains,	and	carved	oak	furniture,	the	whole	lit	up	by	a	bright, </p>
<p class="calibre1">cheerful	 fire,	 was	 very	 cosy.	 But	 here,	 in	 the	 haunted	 room	 next	 door,	 the	 fire was	only	lit	at	night,	and	now	one	of	the	windows	over	the	moat	was	open,	and	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	very	cold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	 went	 over	 to	 the	 open	 window.	 She	 leant	 over	 and	 stared	 down	 into	 the dark,	sullen-looking	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	beautiful	this	place	must	be	in	summer!"	she	exclaimed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	hope	you	will	come	and	see	it,	this	next	summer." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	spoke	in	measured	tones,	but	deep	in	his	heart	he	not	only	hoped,	but	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	determined	on	something	very	different—namely,	that	the	girl	now	turning</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>her	bright,	guileless,	eager	face	to	his	would	then	be	installed	at	Wyndfell	Hall	as his	 wife,	 and	 therefore	 as	 mistress	 of	 the	 wonderful	 old	 house.	 And	 this	 hope, this	 imperious	 determination,	 turned	 his	 mind	 suddenly	 to	 a	 less	 agreeable</p>
<p class="calibre1">subject	of	thought—that	is,	to	Bubbles	Dunster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had	he	known	what	he	now	knew	about	Bubbles'	curious	gift,	he	would	not	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">included	her	in	his	Christmas	party.	He	felt	that	she	might	become	a	disturbing</p>
<p class="calibre1">element	in	the	pleasant	gathering.	Also	he	was	beginning	to	suspect	that	she	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	like	him,	and	it	was	a	disagreeable,	unnerving	suspicion	in	his	present	mood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	do	you	think	of	Bubbles	Dunster?"	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	I	like	her!"	cried	Helen.	"I	think	she's	a	wonderful	girl!"	And	then	her	voice took	 on	 a	 graver	 tinge:	 "I	 couldn't	 help	 being	 very	 much	 impressed	 last	 night, Mr.	 Varick.	 You	 see,	 my	 father,	 who	 died	 when	 I	 was	 only	 eight	 years	 old, always	called	me	'Girlie.'	Somehow	that	made	me	feel	as	if	 <i class="calibre4">he	was	really	there</i>." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	yet,"	said	Varick	slowly,	"Bubbles	told	you	nothing	that	you	didn't	know? </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	my	mind	what	happened	last	night	was	simply	a	clever	exhibition	of	thought-</p>
<p class="calibre1">reading.	She's	always	had	the	gift." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	odd	thing	was,"	said	Helen,	after	a	moment's	hesitation,	"that	she	said	my father	didn't	like	my	being	here.  <i class="calibre4">That</i>	wasn't	thought-reading—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There's	 something	 a	 little	 queer—a	 little	 tricky	 and	 malicious	 sometimes—</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	Bubbles,"	he	said	meaningly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	 looked	 at	 him,	 startled.	 "Is	 there	 really?	 How—how	 horrid!"	 she exclaimed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	 you	 mustn't	 take	 everything	 Bubbles	 says	 as	 gospel	 truth,"	 he	 observed, lighting	a	cigarette.	"Still,	she's	a	very	good	sort	in	her	way." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 he	 looked	 at	 her	 now	 puzzled,	 bewildered	 face,	 he	 realized	 that	 he	 had produced	on	Helen's	mind	exactly	the	impression	he	had	meant	to	do.	If	Bubbles</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	anything	about	him	which—well,	which	he	would	rather	was	left	unsaid—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	would	take	no	notice	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	VIII</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	party	spent	the	rest	of	the	morning	in	making	friends	with	one	another.	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tapster	had	already	singled	out	Bubbles	Dunster	at	dinner	the	night	before.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	one	of	those	men—there	are	many	such—who,	while	professing	to	despise</p>
<p class="calibre1">women,	 yet	 devote	 a	 great	 deal	 of	 not	 very	 profitable	 thought	 to	 them,	 and	 to their	singular,	unexpected,	and	often	untoward	behaviour! </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	for	Sir	Lyon	Dilsford,	he	was	amused	and	touched	to	discover	that,	as	is	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">often	the	case	with	a	young	and	generous-hearted	human	being,	Helen	Brabazon</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 a	 sincere,	 if	 somewhat	 vague,	 desire	 to	 use	 her	 money	 for	 the	 good	 of humanity.	He	was	also	touched	and	amused	to	find	how	ignorant	she	was	of	life, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	how	really	child-like,	under	her	staid	and	sensible	appearance.	Of	what	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">called	 "society"	 she	 cherished	 an	 utter	 contempt,	 convinced	 that	 it	 consisted	 of frivolous	women	and	idle	men—in	a	word,	of	heartless	coquettes	and	of	fortune-hunters.	To	Helen	Brabazon	the	world	of	men	and	women	was	still	all	white	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	black.	Sir	Lyon,	who,	like	most	intelligent	men,	enjoyed	few	things	more	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">playing	schoolmaster	to	an	attractive	young	woman,	found	the	hour	that	he	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	 Brabazon	 spent	 together	 in	 the	 library	 of	 Wyndfell	 Hall	 speed	 by	 all	 too quickly.	They	were	both	sorry	when	the	gong	summoned	them	to	luncheon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	while	Varick	had	persuaded	Miss	Burnaby	to	put	on	a	hat	and	jacket,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">go	for	a	little	walk	alone	with	him,	while	Blanche	Farrow	went	off	for	a	talk	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">young	Donnington.	Bubbles	was	the	subject	of	their	conversation,	and	different</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 were	 the	 ingenuous	 young	 man	 and	 his	 somewhat	 cynical	 and	 worldly</p>
<p class="calibre1">companion,	 they	 found	 that	 they	 were	 cordially	 agreed	 as	 to	 the	 desirability	 of Bubbles	 abandoning	 the	 practices	 which	 had	 led	 to	 Mr.	 Burnaby's	 abrupt</p>
<p class="calibre1">departure	that	morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	 course,	 I	 think	 them	 simply	 an	 extension	 of	 the	 extraordinary	 thought-reading	gifts	she	had	as	a	small	child,"	observed	Blanche. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	wish	I	could	think	it	was	only	that—I'm	afraid	it's	a	good	deal	more	than	mere thought-reading,"	Donnington	said	reluctantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>Luncheon	 was	 a	 pleasant,	 lively	 meal;	 and	 after	 they	 had	 all	 had	 coffee	 and cigarettes,	Bubbles	managed	to	press	almost	the	whole	party	into	the	business	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">decorating	 the	 church.	 Their	 host	 entered	 into	 the	 scheme	 with	 seeming</p>
<p class="calibre1">heartiness;	but	at	the	last	moment	he	and	Blanche	Farrow	elected	to	stay	at	home</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	Miss	Burnaby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	younger	folk	started	off,	a	cheerful	party—James	Tapster,	who,	as	the	others</p>
<p class="calibre1">realized	 by	 something	 he	 said,	 hadn't	 been	 into	 a	 church	 for	 years	 (he	 said	 he hated	weddings,	and,	on	principle,	never	attended	funerals);	Sir	Lyon,	who	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">always	at	anyone's	disposal	when	a	bit	of	work	had	to	be	done;	Helen	Brabazon, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who	declared	joyfully	that	she	had	always	longed	to	decorate	a	country	church; </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	 herself,	 who	 drove	 the	 donkey-cart	 piled	 high	 with	 holly	 and	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">mistletoe;	and	Donnington,	who	pulled	the	donkey	along. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suffolk	 is	 a	 county	 of	 noble	 village	 churches;	 but	 of	 the	 lively	 group	 of	 young people	 who	 approached	 it	 on	 this	 particular	 Christmas	 Eve,	 only	 Donnington</p>
<p class="calibre1">understood	what	a	rare	and	perfect	ecclesiastical	building	stood	before	them.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	inherited	from	a	scholarly	father	a	keen	interest	in	church	architecture,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	had	read	an	account	of	Darnaston	church	the	night	before	in	the	book	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">dealt	with	Wyndfell	Hall	and	its	surroundings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 were	 met	 in	 the	 porch	 by	 the	 bachelor	 rector.	 "This	 is	 really	 kind!"	 he exclaimed.	 "And	 it	 will	 be	 of	 the	 greatest	 help,	 for	 I've	 been	 sent	 for	 to	 a neighbouring	parish	unexpectedly,	and	I'm	afraid	that	I	can't	stop	and	help	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 the	 little	 party	 passed	 through	 into	 the	 church,	 more	 than	 one	 of	 them	 was impressed	by	its	lofty	beauty.	Indeed,	the	word	which	rose	to	both	Sir	Lyon's	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Donnington's	lips	was	the	word	"impressive."	Neither	of	them	had	ever	seen	so impressive	a	country	church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 lifted	 from	 the	 donkey-cart	 the	 little	 heap	 of	 holly	 and	 other	 greenery looked	 pitifully	 small	 lying	 on	 the	 stone	 floor	 of	 the	 central	 aisle;	 and	 though everyone	 worked	 with	 a	 will,	 there	 wasn't	 very	 much	 to	 show	 for	 it	 when	 Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tapster	declared,	in	a	cross	tone,	that	it	must	be	getting	near	tea-time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	 much	 more	 nearly	 finished	 than	 any	 of	 you	 realize,"	 said	 Bubbles	 good-humouredly.	"I've	done	this	sort	of	thing	every	year	since	I	was	quite	a	kid.	Bill and	I	will	come	down	after	tea	and	finish	it	up.	We	shan't	want	 <i class="calibre4">you</i>." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	shouldn't	mind	coming	back,"	exclaimed	Helen	Brabazon.	"I've	enjoyed	every minute	of	the	time	here!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a>But	 Bubbles	 declared	 that	 she	 didn't	 want	 any	 of	 them	 but	 Bill.	 All	 she	 would ask	the	other	men	to	do	would	be	to	cut	down	some	trails	of	ivy.	She	explained</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	she	always	avoided	the	use	of	ivy	unless,	as	in	this	case,	quantity	rather	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">quality	was	required. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	they	all	tramped	cheerfully	back	to	Wyndfell	Hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tea	was	served	in	the	library,	and	the	host	looked	on	with	benign	satisfaction	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	lively	scene,	though	Blanche	Farrow	saw	his	face	change	and	stiffen,	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	penetrating	eyes	rested	in	turn	for	a	long	moment	on	Bubbles'	now	laughing</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	face.	Perhaps	because	of	that	frowning	look,	she	drew	the	girl	after	her	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	hall.	"Come	in	here	for	a	moment,	Bubbles—I	want	to	speak	to	you.	I've	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">heard	Helen	Brabazon	say	something	about	raising	the	ghost.	No	more	séances</p>
<p class="calibre1">while	I'm	in	command	here—is	that	understood?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 Bubbles	 looked	 up	 with	 an	 injured,	 innocent	 expression.	 "Of	 course	 it's understood!	Though,	as	a	matter	of	fact,	Miss	Burnaby	has	already	asked	me	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">give	her	a	private	sitting." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	must	promise	me	to	refuse,	Bubbles—"	Miss	Farrow	spoke	very	decidedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 don't	 know	 how	 you	 do	 what	 you	 did	 last	 night,	 and,	 to	 tell	 you	 the	 truth,	 I don't	care—for	it's	none	of	my	business.	But	there	was	one	moment	this	morning</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	I	feared	that	horrid	Mr.	Burnaby	was	going	to	take	his	sister	and	his	niece</p>
<p class="calibre1">away—and	that	really	would	have	been	serious!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Serious?"	 queried	 Bubbles.	 "Why	 serious,	 Blanche?	 We	 should	 have	 got	 on very	well	without	them." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	aunt	looked	round.	They	were	quite	alone,	standing,	for	the	moment,	in	a	far</p>
<p class="calibre1">corner	of	the	great	room,	near	the	finely	carved	confessional	box,	which	seemed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">even	to	Blanche	Farrow,	an	incongruous	addition	to	the	furniture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're	very	much	mistaken,	Bubbles!	Lionel	would	have	never	forgiven	you—</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	me.	He	attaches	great	importance	to	these	people;	Helen	Brabazon	was	a	great</p>
<p class="calibre1">friend	 of	 his	 poor	 wife's."	 She	 hesitated,	 and	 then	 said	 rather	 awkwardly:	 "I sometimes	wish	you	liked	him	better;	he's	a	good	friend,	Bubbles." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	should	think	more	a	bad	enemy	than	a	good	friend,"	muttered	the	girl,	in	so low	a	voice	that	her	aunt	hardly	caught	the	ungracious	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	all—but	that	was	enough.	Blanche	told	herself	that	she	had	now	amply</p>
<p class="calibre1">fulfilled	 the	 promise	 she	 had	 made	 to	 Lionel	 Varick	 when	 the	 two	 had	 stood</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>speeding	their	parting	guest	this	morning	from	Wyndfell	Hall.	Even	quite	at	the end	Mr.	Burnaby	had	been	barely	civil.	He	seemed	to	think	that	there	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	kind	of	conspiracy	against	him	the	night	before;	and	as	they	watched	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">car	 go	 over	 the	 moat	 bridge,	 Varick	 had	 muttered:	 "I	 wouldn't	 have	 had	 this happen	for	a	thousand	pounds!"	But	he	had	recovered	his	good	temper,	and	even</p>
<p class="calibre1">apologized	 to	 Blanche	 for	 having	 felt	 so	 much	 put	 out	 by	 the	 action	 of	 a cantankerous	old	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	others	were	now	all	streaming	into	the	hall,	and	Bubbles	would	hardly	allow</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	good-natured	Sir	Lyon	and	Bill	Donnington	to	finish	their	cigarettes	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 shooed	 them	 out	 to	 cut	 down	 some	 ivy.	 Varick	 looked	 annoyed	 when	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">heard	 that	 the	 decorations	 in	 the	 church	 were	 not	 yet	 finished.	 "Can't	 we	 bribe some	of	the	servants	to	go	down	and	do	them?"	he	asked.	"It	seems	a	shame	that you	and	Donnington	should	have	to	go	off	there	again	in	the	cold	and	darkness." </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 in	 her	 own	 way	 Bubbles	 had	 almost	 as	 strong	 a	 will	 as	 had	 her	 host.	 She always	knew	what	she	wanted	to	do,	and	generally	managed	to	do	it.	"I	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	rather	finish	the	work	myself,	and	I	think	Bill	would	rather	come	too,"	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	coolly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	 once	 more	 the	 little	 donkey-cart	 was	 loaded	 up	 with	 holly	 and	 trails	 of	 ivy, and	the	two	set	off	amid	the	good-natured	comments	and	chaff	of	the	rest	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">party.	 James	 Tapster	 alone	 looked	 sulky	 and	 annoyed.	 He	 wondered	 how	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bright,	 amusing	 girl	 like	 Bubbles	 Dunster	 could	 stand	 the	 company	 of	 such	 a commonplace	young	man	as	was	Bill	Donnington. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 they	 reached	 the	 short	 stretch	 of	 open	 road	 which	 separated	 Wyndfell	 Hall from	the	church,	Bubbles	felt	suddenly	how	cold	it	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	think	we	shall	have	snow	to-morrow,"	said	Donnington,	looking	round	at	his companion.	He	could	only	just	see	her	little	face	in	the	twilight,	and	when	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">finally	 passed	 through	 the	 porch	 in	 the	 glorious	 old	 church,	 it	 seemed,	 for	 the first	few	moments,	pitch-dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	tell	you	what	I	like	best	about	this	church,"	said	the	girl	suddenly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"For	my	part,"	said	Donnington	simply,	"I	like	everything	about	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 struck	 a	 match,	 and	 after	 a	 few	 minutes	 of	 hard	 work,	 managed	 to	 light several	of	the	hanging	oil	lamps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	I	like	best,"	went	on	Bubbles,	"are	the	animals	up	there." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a>She	 pointed	 to	 where,	 just	 under	 the	 cambered	 oak	 roof,	 there	 ran	 a	 dado,	 on which,	carved	in	white	bas-relief,	lions,	hares,	stags,	dogs,	cats,	crocodiles,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">birds,	 formed	 a	 singular	 procession,	 which	 was	 continued	 round	 the	 nave	 and choir. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	I	like	them	too,"	assented	Donnington	slowly.	"Though	somehow	I	did	feel this	afternoon	that	they	were	out	of	place	in	a	church." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	how	can	you	say	that?"	cried	the	girl.	"I	love	to	think	of	them	here!	I'm	sure that	 at	 night	 they	 leap	 joyfully	 down,	 and	 skip	 about	 the	 church,	 praising	 the Lord." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bubbles!"	he	exclaimed	reprovingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Almost	any	animal,"	she	said,	with	a	touch	of	seriousness,	"is	nicer,	taking	it	all in	 all,	 than	 almost	 any	 human	 being."	 And	 then	 she	 quoted	 in	 the	 deep	 throaty voice	which	was	one	of	her	greatest	charms:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	robin	redbreast	in	a	cage</p>
<p class="calibre1">Puts	all	Heaven	in	a	rage." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	one	 <i class="calibre4">I</i>	should	like	to	see	put	over	every	manger	is:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	horse	misus'd	upon	the	road</p>
<p class="calibre1">Calls	to	Heaven	for	human	blood," </p>
<p class="calibre1">said	Donnington. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh!"	she	cried,	"and	Bill,	surely	the	best	of	all	is:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	skylark	wounded	on	the	wing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	cherubim	doth	cease	to	sing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Donnington	 smiled.	 "I	 suppose	 I'm	 more	 practical	 than	 you	 are,"	 he	 said.	 "If	 I were	a	schoolmaster,	I'd	have	inscribed	on	the	walls	of	every	classroom:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kill	not	the	moth	or	butterfly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	the	Last	Judgment	draweth	nigh." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 worked	 very	 hard	 during	 the	 half-hour	 that	 followed,	 though	 only	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">finishing	touches	remained	to	be	done.	Still,	it	meant	moving	a	ladder	about,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">stretching	one's	arms	a	good	deal,	and	Bubbles	insisted	on	doing	her	full	share	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p70"></a>"Let's	 rest	 a	 few	 minutes,"	 she	 said	 at	 last,	 and	 leading	 the	 way	 up	 the	 central aisle,	she	sat	down	wearily	in	one	of	the	carved	choir	stalls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	she	lifted	her	arms,	and	putting	her	hands	behind	her	neck,	she	tipped	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">head	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	young	man	came	and	sat	down	in	the	next	stall.	Bubbles	was	leaning	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	comfortably	now,	her	red	cap	almost	off	her	head.	There	was	a	great	look</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	restfulness	on	her	pale,	sensitive	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	put	out	her	hand	and	felt	for	his;	after	a	moment	of	hesitation	he	slid	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	knelt	close	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bubbles,"	 he	 whispered,	 "my	 darling—darling	 Bubbles.	 I	 wish	 that	 here	 and now	 you	 would	 make	 up	 your	 mind	 to	 give	 up	 everything—"	 He	 stopped</p>
<p class="calibre1">speaking,	and	bending,	kissed	her	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,"	she	said	dreamily.	"Give	up	everything,	Bill?	Perhaps	I	will.	But	what	do you	mean	by	everything?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	self-pitying	note	in	her	low,	vibrant	voice.	"You	know	it	is	given	to people,	 sometimes,	 to	 choose	 between	 good	 and	 evil.	 I'm	 afraid"—she	 leant forward,	and	passed	her	right	hand,	with	a	touch	of	tenderness	most	unusual	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">her,	over	his	upturned	face	and	curly	hair—"I'm	afraid,	Bill,	that,	almost	without knowing	it,	I	chose	evil,	'Evil,	be	thou	my	good.'	Isn't	that	what	the	wicked	old</p>
<p class="calibre1">Satanists	used	to	say?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	you	say	it	too!"	he	exclaimed,	sharply	distressed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	know	I	acted	stupidly—in	fact,	as	we're	in	a	church	I	don't	mind	saying	I	acted very	wrongly	last	night." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	spoke	in	a	serious	tone—more	seriously,	indeed,	than	she	had	ever	yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">spoken	to	her	faithful,	long-suffering	friend.	"But	a	great	deal	of	what	happens	to me	and	round	me,	Bill,	I	can't	help—I	wish	I	could,"	she	said	slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	quite	understand."	There	was	a	painful	choking	feeling	in	his	throat.	"Try and	tell	me	what	you	mean,	Bubbles." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	I	mean	is	clear	enough"—she	now	spoke	with	a	touch	of	impatience.	"I mean	that	wherever	I	am,  <i class="calibre4">They</i>	come	too,	and	gather	about	me.	It	wasn't	my	fault that	that	horrible	Thing	appeared	to	Pegler	as	soon	as	I	entered	the	house." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>"But	 why	 should	 you	 think	 the	 ghost	 Pegler	 saw—if	 she	 did	 see	 it—had anything	 to	 do	 with	 you?	 Wyndfell	 Hall	 has	 been	 haunted	 for	 over	 a	 hundred years—so	the	village	people	say." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pegler	 saw	 nothing	 till	 I	 came.	 And	 though	 I	 struggle	 against	 the	 belief,	 and though	I	very	seldom	admit	it,	even	to	myself,	I	know	quite	well,	Bill,	that	I'm</p>
<p class="calibre1">never	really	alone—never	free	of	Them	unless—unless,	Bill,	I'm	in	a	holy	place, </p>
<p class="calibre1">when	they	don't	dare	to	come." </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	tone	of	fear,	of	awful	dread,	in	her	voice.	In	spite	of	himself	he	felt</p>
<p class="calibre1">impressed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	why	should	they	come	specially	round	 <i class="calibre4">you</i>?"	he	asked	uneasily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	 know	 as	 well	 as	 I	 do	 that	 I'm	 a	 strong	 medium.	 But	 I'll	 tell	 you,	 Bill, something	which	I've	never	told	you	before." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,"	he	said,	with	a	strange	sinking	of	the	heart.	"What's	that,	Bubbles?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	know	that	Persian	magician,	or	Wise	Man,	whom	certain	people	in	London</p>
<p class="calibre1">went	cracked	over	last	spring?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	man	you	 <i class="calibre4">would</i>	go	and	see?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	of	course	I	mean	that	man.	Well,	when	he	saw	me	he	made	his	interpreter</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell	me	that	he	had	a	special	message	for	me—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	 was	 leaning	 forward	 now,	 her	 hands	 resting	 on	 Bill's	 shoulders.	 "I wonder	 if	 I	 ought	 to	 tell	 you	 all	 he	 said,"	 she	 whispered.	 "Perhaps	 I	 ought	 to keep	it	secret." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	course	you	ought	to	tell	me!	What	was	the	message?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	said	that	I	had	rent	the	veil,	wilfully,	and	that	I	was	often	surrounded	by	the evil	 demons	 who	 had	 come	 rushing	 through;	 that	 only	 by	 fasting	 and	 praying could	I	hope	to	drive	them	back,	and	close	the	rent	which	I	had	made." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	shouldn't	allow	myself	to	think	too	much	of	what	he	said,"	said	Bill	hoarsely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	yet—and	yet,	Bubbles?	There	may	have	been	something	in	it—." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	spoke	very	earnestly,	poor	boy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	course	there	was	a	great	deal	in	it.	But	they're	not	always	demons,"	she	said slowly.	 "Now,	 for	 instance,	 as	 I	 sit	 here,	 where	 good,	 simple	 people	 have	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a>praying	 together	 for	 hundreds	 of	 years,	 the	 atmosphere	 is	 kind	 and	 holy,	 not wicked	and	malignant,	as	it	was	last	night." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 waited	 a	 moment,	 then	 began	 again,	 "I	 remember	 going	 into	 a	 cottage	 not long	ago,	where	an	old	man	holds	a	prayer	meeting	every	Wednesday	evening—</p>
<p class="calibre1">he's	a	Dissenter—you	know	the	sort	of	man	I	mean?	Well,	I	felt	extraordinarily</p>
<p class="calibre1">comforted,	and	 <i class="calibre4">left	alone</i>." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 voice	 sank	 to	 a	 low	 whisper.	 "I	 suppose"—there	 came	 a	 little	 catch	 in	 her voice—"I	 suppose,	 Bill,	 that	 I	 am	 what	 people	 used	 to	 call	 'possessed.'	 In	 old days	 I	 should	 have	 been	 burnt	 as	 a	 witch.	 Sometimes	 I	 feel	 as	 if	 a	 battle	 were going	on	round	me	and	for	me—a	battle	between	good	and	evil	spirits.	That	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	I	was	feeling	last	night,	before	you	came	up.	I	couldn't	rest—I	couldn't	stay</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	bed.	I	felt	as	if	I	must	move	about	to	avoid—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"To	avoid	what?"	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"—Their	clutchings." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	voice	dropped.	"I've	been	in	old	houses	where	I	seemed	to	know	everything</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	 every	 ghost!"—she	 tried	 to	 smile.	 "People	 don't	 change	 when	 they	 what we	 call	 die.	 If	 they're	 dull	 and	 stupid,	 they	 remain	 dull	 and	 stupid.	 But	 here	 in Wyndfell	 Hall,	 I'm	 frightened.	 I'm	 frightened	 of	 Varick—I	 feel	 as	 if	 there	 were something	 secret,	 secret	 and	 sinister,	 about	 him.	 I	 seem	 to	 hear	 the	 words, </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Beware—beware,'	 when	 he	 is	 standing	 by	 me.	 What	 do	  <i class="calibre4">you</i>	 think	 about	 him, Bill?	There	are	a	lot	of	lying	spirits	about." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 haven't	 thought	 much	 about	 Varick	 one	 way	 or	 the	 other,"	 said	 Donnington reluctantly.	"But	I	should	have	thought	he	was	a	good	chap.	See	how	fond	Miss</p>
<p class="calibre1">Farrow	is	of	him?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	 doesn't	 mean	 much,"	 she	 said	 dreamily.	 "Blanche	 doesn't	 know	 anything about	 human	 nature—she	 only	 thinks	 she	 does.	 She's	 no	 spiritual	 vision	 left	 at all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	sorry	you	have	that	feeling	about	Varick,"	said	Bill	uncomfortably. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Varick	is	never	alone,"	said	Bubbles	slowly.	"When	I	first	arrived,	and	he	came out	to	the	porch	to	meet	me,	there	was	Something	standing	by	him,	which	looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	real,	Bill,	that	I	thought	it	really	was	a	woman	of	flesh	and	blood.	I	nearly	said</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	him,	'Who's	that?	Introduce	me.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a>"D'you	mean	you	think	you	actually	see	spirits,	even	when	you're	not	setting	out to	do	so,	Bubbles?"	asked.	Bill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 had	 never	 said	 that	 to	 him	 before.	 But	 then	 this	 was	 the	 first	 time	 she	 had ever	talked	to	him	as	freely	and	as	frankly	as	she	was	talking	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	that's	exactly	what	I	do	mean,"	she	said.	"It's	a	sort	of	power	that	grows—</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	oh,	Bill,	I'd	do	anything	in	the	world	to	get	rid	of	it!	But	this	woman	whom	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">saw	 standing	 by	 Lionel	 Varick	 in	 the	 porch	 was	 not	 a	 spirit.	 She	 was	 an	 astral body;	that	is,	she	was	alive	somewhere	else:	it	was	her	thoughts—her	vengeful, </p>
<p class="calibre1">malicious	thoughts—which	brought	her	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	can't	believe	that!"	he	exclaimed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	true,	Bill.	Though	I	never	saw	an	astral	body	before,	I	knew	that	Thing	to	be one—as	soon	as	I	realized	it	wasn't	a	real	woman	standing	there." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	was	she	like?"	he	asked,	impressed	against	his	will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"An	 ugly,	 commonplace-looking	 woman.	 But	 she	 had	 a	 powerful,	 determined</p>
<p class="calibre1">sort	of	face,	and	she	was	staring	up	at	him	with	a	horrible	expression:	I	could	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	she	hated	him,	and	wished	him	ill—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Have	you	ever	seen	the—the	Thing	again?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes,	of	course	I	have.	The	same	astral	body	was	there	last	night.	It	was	from	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	his	mother	was	trying	to	shield	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	you've	never	seen	this	astral	body—as	you	call	it—excepting	on	those	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">occasions?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	hesitated.	"I've	only	seen	her	clearly	twice.	But	during	the	week	that	I've been	here,	I've	often	felt	that	she	was	close	to	Lionel	Varick." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	what's	your	theory	about	her?	Why	does	she	hate	him,	I	mean?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My	theory—?"	the	girl	hesitated	again.	"I	should	think	it's	someone	he	was	fond of	 when	 he	 was	 a	 young	 man,	 and	 whom	 he	 treated	 badly.	 She's	 ugly	 enough now—but	then	women	do	change	so." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bubbles,"	he	uttered	her	name	very	seriously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	Bill?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a>"Surely	 you	 can	 stop	 yourself	 seeing	 these	 kind	 of	 strange,	 dreadful,	 unnatural things?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	 did	 not	 answer	 all	 at	 once.	 And	 then	 she	 said:	 "Yes—and	 no,	 Bill!	 It sometimes	happens	that	I	see	what	you	would	call	a	ghost	without	wishing	to	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">it;	yet	I	confess	that	sometimes	I	 <i class="calibre4">could</i>	stop	myself.	But	it	excites	and	stimulates me!	I	feel	a	sort	of	longing	to	be	in	touch	with	what	no	one	else	is	in	touch	with. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I'll	tell	you	one	thing"—she	was	pressing	up	closer	to	him	now,	and	his	heart was	beating....	If	only	this	enchanted	hour	could	go	on—if	only	Bubbles	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">continue	in	this	gentle,	sincere,	confiding	mood—</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,"	he	said	hoarsely,	"what	will	you	tell	me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	never	see	anything	bad	when	I'm	with	you.	I	think	I	saw	your	Guardian	Angel</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	other	day,	Bill." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	tried	to	laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Indeed	I	did!	Though	you	are	so	tiresome	and	priggish,"	she	whispered,	"though often,	as	you	know,	I	should	like	to	shake	you,	still,	I	know	that	you've	chosen</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	good	way;	that's	why	our	ways	lie	so	apart,	dearest—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	she	uttered	the	strange	words,	she	had	slid	down,	and	was	now	lying	in	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">arms,	her	face	turned	up	to	his	in	the	dim	light.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	 ways	 apart?	 Ah,	 no!	 He	 caught	 her	 fiercely	 to	 his	 heart,	 and	 for	 the	 first time	their	lips	met	in	a	long,	clinging	kiss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	 all	 at	 once,	 he	 got	 up	 and	 pulled	 Bubbles	 on	 to	 her	 feet.	 "We	 must	 be going	 back	 to	 the	 house,"	 he	 said,	 speaking	 with	 a	 touch	 of	 hardness	 and decision	which	was	rare	in	his	dealings	with	the	girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Watch	 with	 me,	 and	 pray	 for	 me,"	 she	 muttered—and	 then:	 "You	 don't	 know what	a	comfort	you	are	to	me,	Bill." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	wild	wish	suddenly	possessed	him	to	turn	and	implore	her,	now	that	she	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	this	strange,	gentle,	yielding	mood,	to	marry	him	at	once—to	become	his	wife</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 secret,	 under	 any	 conditions	 that	 seemed	 good	 to	 her!	 But	 he	 checked	 the impulse,	drove	it	back.	He	felt	that	he	would	be	taking	a	mean	advantage	if	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">did	that	now.	She	had	once	said	to	him:	"I	 <i class="calibre4">must</i>	marry	a	rich	man,	Bill.	I	should make	any	poor	man	miserable." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a>He	had	never	forgotten	that,	nor	forgiven	her	for	saying	it—though	he	had	never believed	that	it	was	true. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Almost	as	if	she	was	reading	into	his	mind,	Bubbles	said	wistfully:	"You	won't</p>
<p class="calibre1">leave	off	caring	for	me,	Bill?	Not	even	if	I	marry	somebody	else?	Not	even—?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 laughed	 nervously,	 and	 her	 laugh,	 to	 Donnington	 a	 horrible	 laugh,	 echoed through	 the	 dimly	 lit	 church.	 "Not	 even,"	 she	 repeated,	 "if	 I	 bring	 myself	 to marry	Mr.	Tapster?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 seized	 her	 roughly	 by	 the	 arm.	 "What	 d'you	 mean,	 Bubbles?"	 he	 asked sternly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	do	that!	You	hurt	me—I	was	only	joking,"	she	said,	shrinking	back.	"But you	are	really	 <i class="calibre4">too</i>	simple,	Bill.	Didn't	it	occur	to	you	that	Mr.	Tapster	had	been asked	here	for	me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"For	 you?"	 He	 uttered	 the	 words	 mechanically.	 He	 understood	 now	 why	 men sometimes	murder	their	sweet-hearts—for	no	apparent	motive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	not	a	bad	sort.	It	isn't	his	fault	that	he's	so	repulsive.	It	wouldn't	be	fair	if he	was	as	rich	as	that,	and	good-looking,	and	amiable,	and	agreeable,	as	well—</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	walking	down	the	church,	and	perhaps	Bubbles	caught	a	glimpse	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 heart:	 "I'm	 a	 beast,"	 she	 exclaimed.	 "A	 beast	 to	 have	 spoiled	 our	 time together	in	this	dear	old	church	by	saying	that	to	you	about	Mr.	Tapster.	Try	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">forget	it,	Bill!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 made	 no	 answer.	 His	 brain	 was	 in	 a	 whirlwind	 of	 wrath,	 of	 suspicion,	 of anger,	 of	 sick	 jealousy.	 This	 was	 the	 real	 danger—not	 all	 the	 nonsense	 that Bubbles	 talked	 about	 her	 power	 of	 raising	 ghosts,	 and	 of	 being	 haunted	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1">unquiet	spirits.	The	real	danger	the	girl	was	in	now	was	that	of	being	persuaded</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	marrying	that	loathsome	Tapster—for	his	money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 left	 her	 near	 the	 door	 while	 he	 went	 back	 to	 put	 out	 the	 lights.	 Then	 he groped	his	way	to	where	she	was	standing,	waiting	for	him.	In	the	darkness	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	for,	found,	and	lifted,	the	heavy	latch.	Together	they	began	pacing	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 path	 between	 the	 graves	 in	 the	 churchyard,	 and	 then	 all	 of	 a	 sudden	 he	 put his	hand	on	her	arm:	"What's	that?	Hark!"	he	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 seemed	 to	 hear	 issuing	 from	 the	 grand	 old	 church	 a	 confused,	 musical</p>
<p class="calibre1">medley	of	sounds—a	bleating,	a	neighing,	a	lowing,	even	a	faint	trumpeting,	all</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>mingling	together	and	forming	a	strange,	not	unmelodious	harmony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"D'you	 hear	 anything,	 Bubbles?"	 he	 asked,	 his	 heart	 beating,	 his	 face,	 in	 the darkness,	all	aglow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	nothing,"	she	answered	back,	surprised.	"We	must	hurry,	Bill.	We're	late	as it	is." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	IX</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 had	 been	 Bubbles'	 happy	 idea	 that	 the	 children	 of	 the	 tiny	 hamlet	 which	 lay half-a-mile	 from	 Wyndfell	 Hall,	 should	 have	 a	 Christmas	 tree.	 Hers,	 also,	 that the	 treat	 for	 the	 children	 was	 to	 be	 combined	 with	 the	 distribution	 of	 a	 certain amount	of	coal	and	of	other	creature	comforts	to	the	older	folk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	the	arrangements	with	regard	to	this	double	function	had	been	made	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 party	 at	 Wyndfell	 Hall	 had	 been	 gathered	 together.	 But	 still,	 there	 were	 all sorts	of	last	things	to	be	thought	of,	and	Lionel	Varick	and	Bubbles	became	quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">chummy	over	the	affair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	 Farrow	 was	 secretly	 amused	 to	 note	 with	 what	 zest	 her	 friend	 threw himself	into	the	rôle	of	country	squire.	She	thought	it	a	trifle	absurd,	the	more	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">that,	as	a	matter	of	fact,	the	people	of	Wyndfell	Green	were	not	his	tenants,	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	had	only	a	life	interest	in	the	house	itself.	But	Varick	was	determined	to	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	good,	old-fashioned	country	Christmas;	and	he	was	seconded	in	his	desire	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	 by	 Bubbles,	 but	 by	 Helen	 Brabazon,	 who	 entered	 into	 everything	 with	 an almost	childish	eagerness.	Indeed,	the	doings	on	Christmas	Day	brought	her	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	 together,	 too.	 They	 began	 calling	 each	 other	 by	 their	 Christian	 names, and	soon	the	simple-minded	heiress	became	as	if	bewitched	by	the	other	girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She's	 a	 wonderful	 creature,"	 she	 confided	 to	 that	 same	 wonderful	 girl's	 aunt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've	never	known	anyone	in	the	least	like	Bubbles!	At	first	I	confess	I	thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 very	 odd—she	 almost	 repelled	 me.	 But	 now	 I	 can	 see	 what	 a	 kind,	 good heart	she	has,	and	I	do	hope	she'll	let	me	be	her	friend." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 think	 you	 would	 be	 a	 very	 good	 friend	 for	 Bubbles,"	 answered	 Blanche pleasantly.	 "You're	 quite	 right	 as	 to	 one	 thing,	 Miss	 Brabazon—she	 has	 a	 very kind,	warm	heart.	She	loves	to	give	people	pleasure.	She's	quite	delightful	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">children." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 speaker	 felt	 that	 it	 would	 indeed	 be	 a	 good	 thing	 if	 Bubbles	 could	 attach herself	 to	 such	 a	 simple	 yet	 sensible	 friend	 as	 was	 this	 enormously	 rich	 girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	if	you	really	like	Bubbles,"	went	on	Blanche	Farrow	deliberately,	"then	I should	like	just	to	tell	you	one	or	two	things	about	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a>Helen	 became	 all	 eager,	 pleased	 attention.	 "Yes?"	 she	 exclaimed.	 "I	 wish	 you would!	Bubbles	interests	me	more	than	anyone	I	ever	met." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	want	to	tell	you	that	I	and	Bubbles'	father	very	much	regret	her	going	in	for	all that—that	occultism,	I	believe	it's	called." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	 you	 and	 Mr.	 Varick	 both	 think	 it's	 only	 thought-reading,"	 said	 Helen quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	felt	rather	surprised.	It	was	acute	and	clever	of	the	girl	to	have	said	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	no	doubt	Miss	Burnaby	had	repeated	their	conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes;	 I	 personally	 think	 it's	 only	 thought-reading.	 Still,	 it's	 thought-reading carried	very	far.	The	kind	of	power	Bubbles	showed	the	night	before	last	seems</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	me	partly	hypnotic,	and	that's	why	I	disapprove	of	it	so	strongly." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 agree,"	 said	 Helen	 thoughtfully.	 "It	 was	 much	 more	 than	 ordinary	 thought-reading.	And	I	suppose	that	it's	true	that	she	thought	she	saw	the—the	spirits	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">described	so	wonderfully?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 doubt	 if	 even	 she	 thought	 she	 actually	 saw	 them.	 I	 think	 she	 only	 perceived each	image	in	the	mind	of	the	person	to	whom	she	was	speaking." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 suppose,"	 asked	 Helen	 hesitatingly,	 "that	 you	 haven't	 the	 slightest	 belief	 in ghosts,	Miss	Farrow?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	I	haven't	the	slightest	belief	in	ghosts,"	Blanche	smiled.	"But	I	do	believe that	if	a	person	thinks	sufficiently	hard	about	it,	he	or	she	can	almost	evolve	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">figure	 of	 a	 ghost.	 I	 think	 that's	 what	 happened	 to	 my	 maid	 the	 other	 night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pegler's	a	most	sensible	person,	yet	she's	quite	convinced	that	she	saw	the	ghost</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	woman	who	is	believed	to	have	killed	her	little	stepson	in	the	room	next	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	in	which	I	am	now	sleeping." </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then	 as	 she	 saw	 a	 rather	 peculiar	 look	 flit	 over	 her	 companion's	 face,	 she added	quickly:	"D'you	think	that	you	have	seen	anything	since	you've	been	here, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Brabazon?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	hesitated.	"No,"	she	said.	"I	haven't	exactly	seen	anything.	But—well,	the truth	is,	Miss	Farrow,	that	I	do	feel	sometimes	as	if	Wyndfell	Hall	was	haunted</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	 the	 spirit	 of	 my	 poor	 friend	 Milly,	 Mr.	 Varick's	 wife.	 Perhaps	 I	 feel	 as	 I	 do because,	of	course,	I	know	that	this	strange	and	beautiful	old	house	was	once	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">home.	It's	pathetic,	isn't	it,	to	see	how	very	little	remains	of	her	here?	One	might, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a>indeed,	say	that	nothing	remains	of	her	at	all!	I	haven't	even	been	able	to	find	out which	was	her	room;	and	I've	often	wondered	in	the	last	two	days	whether	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">generally	sat	in	the	hall	or	in	that	lovely	little	drawing-room." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 can	 tell	 you	 one	 thing,"	 said	 Blanche	 rather	 shortly,	 "that	 is	 that	 there	 is	 a room	in	this	house	called	'the	schoolroom.'	It's	between	the	dining-room	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">servants'	 offices.	 I	 believe	 it	 was	 there	 that	 Miss	 Fauncey,	 as	 the	 people	 about here	 still	 call	 her,	 used	 to	 do	 her	 lessons,	 with	 a	 rather	 disagreeable	 woman rejoicing	in	the	extraordinary	name	of	Pigchalke,	who	lived	on	with	her	till	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">married." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	horrible,	horrible	woman!"	exclaimed	Helen.	"Of	course	I	know	about	 <i class="calibre4">her</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 adored	 poor	 Milly.	 But	 she	 was	 an	 awful	 tyrant	 to	 her	 all	 the	 same.	 She actually	 wrote	 to	 me	 some	 time	 ago.	 It	 was	 such	 an	 odd	 letter—quite	 a	 mad letter,	in	fact.	It	struck	me	as	so	queer	that	before	answering	it	I	sent	it	on	to	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick.	She	wanted	to	see	me,	to	talk	to	me	about	poor	Milly's	last	illness.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">has	 a	 kind	 of	 crazy	 hatred	 of	 Mr.	 Varick.	 Of	 course	 I	 got	 out	 of	 seeing	 her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Luckily	 we	 were	 just	 starting	 for	 Strathpeffer.	 I	 put	 her	 off—I	 didn't	 actually refuse.	I	said	I	couldn't	see	her	then,	but	that	I	would	write	to	her	later." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lionel	mentioned	her	to	me	the	other	day.	He	allows	her	a	hundred	a	year,"	said Blanche	indifferently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	very	good	of	him!"	in	a	very	different	tone	of	voice	she	said	musingly:	"I have	 sometimes	 wondered	 if	 the	 room	 I'm	 sleeping	 in	 now	 was	 that	 in	 which Milly	slept	as	a	girl.	Sometimes	I	feel	as	if	she	was	close	to	me,	trying	to	speak</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	me—it's	a	most	queer,	uncanny,	horrid	kind	of	feeling!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	and	Bubbles	knew	from	experience	that	Christmas	Day	in	the	country	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 invariably	 a	 pleasant	 day;	 but	 they	 had	 thought	 out	 every	 arrangement	 to make	it	"go"	as	well	as	was	possible.	They	were	all	to	have	a	sort	of	early	tea, and	then	those	who	felt	like	it	would	proceed	to	the	village	schoolroom,	and	help</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	Christmas	Treat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	 important	 feature	 of	 the	 proceedings	 was	 to	 be	 a	 short	 speech	 by	 Lionel Varick.	 Blanche	 had	 found,	 to	 her	 surprise	 and	 amusement,	 that	 he	 had	 set	 his heart	on	making	it.	He	wanted	to	get	into	touch	with	his	poorer	neighbours—not</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	 in	 a	 material	 sense,	 by	 distributing	 gifts	 of	 beef	 and	 blankets;	 that	 he	 had already	arranged	to	do—but	in	a	closer,	more	human	sense.	No	one	she	had	ever</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>known	 desired	 more	 ardently	 to	 be	 liked	 than	 did	 the	 new	 owner	 of	 Wyndfell Hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	programme	was	carried	out	to	the	letter.	They	all	drank	a	cup	of	tea	standing</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 hall	 when	 dressed	 ready	 for	 their	 expedition.	 Everyone	 was	 happy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">everyone	was	in	a	good	humour—excepting,	perhaps,	Bill	Donnington.	The	few</p>
<p class="calibre1">words	 Bubbles	 had	 said	 concerning	 Mr.	 Tapster	 had	 frightened,	 as	 well	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">angered	 him.	 He	 watched	 the	 unattractive	 millionaire	 with	 jealous	 eyes.	 It	 was only	too	clear	that	Bubbles	had	fascinated	James	Tapster,	as	she	generally	did	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">dull	 and	 unimaginative	 people.	 But	 Donnington,	 perforce,	 had	 to	 keep	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">jealous	feelings	to	himself;	and	after	they	had	all	reached	the	school-room	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pretty,	picturesque	little	village,	he	found	he	had	far	too	much	to	do	in	helping	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">serve	the	hungry	children	and	their	parents	with	the	feast	provided	for	them,	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	time	for	private	feelings	of	fear,	jealousy	and	pain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 small	 platform	 had	 been	 erected	 across	 one	 end	 of	 the	 room.	 But	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">programme	of	the	proceedings	which	were	to	take	place	thereon	only	contained</p>
<p class="calibre1">two	 items.	 The	 first	 of	 these	 took	 most	 of	 the	 Wyndfell	 Hall	 house-party</p>
<p class="calibre1">completely	by	surprise;	for	Bubbles	and	her	aunt	had	kept	their	secret	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tables	had	been	pushed	aside,	benches	put	end	to	end;	the	whole	audience,	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lionel	Varick's	guests	in	front,	were	seated,	when	suddenly	there	leapt	on	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">platform	the	strangest	and	most	fantastic-looking	little	figure	imaginable! </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	moment	no	one,	except	Bill	Donnington,	guessed	who	or	what	the	figure</p>
<p class="calibre1">was.	There	came	a	great	clapping	of	hands	and	stamping	of	feet—for,	of	course, </p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 was	 Bubbles!	 Bubbles	 dressed	 up	 as	 a	 witch—red	 cloak,	 high	 peaked	 hat, </p>
<p class="calibre1">short	multi-coloured	skirt,	high	boots	and	broom-stick—all	complete! </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 the	 applause	 had	 died	 down,	 she	 recited	 a	 quaint	 little	 poem	 of	 her	 own composition,	wishing	all	there	present	the	best	of	luck	in	the	coming	year.	And</p>
<p class="calibre1">then	she	executed	a	kind	of	fantastic	 <i class="calibre4">pas	seul</i>,	skimming	hither	and	thither	across the	tiny	stage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	watched	her	breathlessly:	Donnington	with	mingled	admiration,	love, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	jealous	disapproval;	James	Tapster	with	a	feeling	that	perhaps	the	time	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">come	for	him	to	allow	himself	to	be	"caught"	at	last;	Helen	Brabazon	with	wide-eyed,	 kindly	 envy	 of	 the	 other	 girl's	 cleverness;	 Varick	 with	 a	 queer	 feeling	 of growing	suspicion	and	dislike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	 Bubbles	 waved	 her	 broom-stick,	 and	 more	 than	 one	 of	 those	 present</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>imagined	that	they	saw	the	light,	airy-looking	little	figure	flying	across	the	hall, and	so	out	of	a	window—. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	whole	performance	did	not	last	five	minutes,	and	yet	few	of	those	who	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">present	 ever	 forgot	 it.	 It	 was	 so	 strange,	 so	 uncanny,	 so	 vivid.	 Bill	 Donnington heard	one	of	the	village	women	behind	him	say:	"There	now!	Did	you	ever	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	like?	She	was	the	sort	they	burnt	in	the	old	days,	and	I	don't	wonder,	either." </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 this	 exciting	 performance	 the	 appearance	 of	 "the	 squire,"	 as	 some	 of	 the village	 people	 were	 already	 beginning	 to	 call	 him,	 did	 not	 produce,	 perhaps, quite	the	sensation	it	might	have	done	had	he	been	the	first	instead	of	the	second</p>
<p class="calibre1">item	on	the	programme.	But	as	he	stood	there,	a	fine	figure	of	a	man,	his	keen, </p>
<p class="calibre1">good-looking	 face	 lit	 up	 with	 a	 very	 agreeable	 expression	 of	 kindliness	 and	 of good-will,	a	wave	of	appreciation	seemed	to	surge	towards	him	from	the	body	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poor	Milly's	father	had	been	the	sort	of	landowner—to	the	honour	of	England	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 said	 the	 species	 has	 ever	 been	 comparatively	 rare—who	 regarded	 his	 tenants as	 of	 less	 interest	 than	 the	 livestock	 on	 his	 home	 farm.	 What	 he	 had	 done	 for them	he	had	done	grudgingly;	but	it	was	even	now	clear	to	them	all	that	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">new	squire	they	had	a	very	different	kind	of	gentleman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	was	moved	and	touched—far	more	so	than	any	of	those	present	realized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 scene	 before	 him—this	 humble	 little	 school-room,	 and	 the	 simple	 people</p>
<p class="calibre1">standing	there—meant	to	him	the	fulfilment	of	a	life-long	dream.	And	that	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	all.	As	he	was	hesitating	for	his	first	word,	his	eyes	rested	on	the	front	bench</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	his	audience,	and	he	saw	Helen	Brabazon's	eager,	guileless	face,	upturned	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his,	full	of	interest	and	sympathy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 also	 felt	 himself	 in	 touch	 with	 the	 others	 there.	 Blanche,	 looking	 her	 own intelligent,	 dignified,	 pleasant	 self,	 was	 a	 goodly	 sight.	 Sir	 Lyon	 Dilsford,	 too, was	 in	 the	 picture;	 but	 Varick	 felt	 a	 sudden	 pang	 of	 sympathy	 for	 the	 landless baronet.	 Sir	 Lyon	 would	 have	 made	 such	 a	 good,	 conscientious	 squire;	 he	 was the	 kind	 of	 man	 who	 would	 have	 helped	 the	 boys	 to	 get	 on	 in	 the	 world—the girls,	if	need	be,	to	make	happy	marriages.	James	Tapster	looked	rather	out	of	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">all;	 he	 looked	 his	 apathetic,	 sulky	 self—a	 man	 whom	 nothing	 would	 ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">galvanize	 into	 real	 good-fellowship.	 How	 could	 so	 intelligent	 a	 woman	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	think	that	any	money	could	compensate	a	clever,	high-spirited	girl	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	 for	 marrying	 a	 James	 Tapster?	 Varick	 was	 glad	 Bubbles	 was	 not	 "in front."	She	was	probably	divesting	herself	of	that	extraordinary	witch	costume	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a>hers	behind	the	little	curtained	aperture	to	his	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then,	all	at	once,	he	realized	that	Bubbles	was	among	his	audience	after	all! </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	sitting	by	herself,	on	a	little	stool	just	below	the	platform.	He	suddenly</p>
<p class="calibre1">saw	 her	 head,	 with	 its	 shock	 of	 dark-brown	 hair,	 and	 there	 came	 over	 him	 a slight	feeling	of	discomfort.	Bubbles	had	worked	like	a	Trojan.	All	this	could	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 happened	 but	 for	 her;	 and	 yet—and	 yet	 Varick	 again	 told	 himself	 that	 he could	 very	 well	 have	 dispensed	 with	 Bubbles	 from	 his	 Christmas	 house	 party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 growing	 up,	 in	 his	 dark,	 secretive	 heart,	 an	 unreasoning,	 violent dislike	to	the	girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 these	 disconnected	 thoughts	 flashed	 through	 his	 mind	 in	 something	 under</p>
<p class="calibre1">half-a-minute,	 and	 then	 Varick	 made	 his	 pleasant	 little	 speech,	 welcoming	 the people	 there,	 and	 saying	 he	 hoped	 there	 would	 ensue	 a	 long	 and	 pleasant</p>
<p class="calibre1">connection	between	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 a	 great	 deal	 more	 stamping	 of	 feet	 and	 handclapping,	 and	 then</p>
<p class="calibre1">gradually	the	company,	gentle	and	simple,	dispersed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Farrow	still	had	long	and	luxuriant	hair,	and	perhaps	the	pleasantest	half-</p>
<p class="calibre1">hour	in	each	day	had	come	to	be	that	half-hour	just	before	she	dressed	for	dinner, </p>
<p class="calibre1">when	 Pegler,	 with	 gentle,	 skilful	 fingers,	 brushed	 and	 combed	 her	 mistress's beautiful	tresses,	and	finally	dressed	them	to	the	best	advantage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	Christmas	night	this	daily	ceremony	had	been	put	off	till	Miss	Farrow's	bed-</p>
<p class="calibre1">time,	when,	after	a	quiet,	short	evening,	the	party	had	broken	up	on	the	happiest</p>
<p class="calibre1">terms	with	one	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Blanche	sat	down,	and	her	maid	began	taking	the	hairpins	out	of	her	hair,	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">told	 herself	 with	 a	 feeling	 of	 gratification	 that	 this	 had	 been	 one	 of	 the pleasantest	Christmas	days	she	had	ever	spent.	Everything	had	gone	off	so	well, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	she	could	see	that	Varick	had	enjoyed	every	moment	of	it,	from	his	surprise</p>
<p class="calibre1">distribution	 of	 little	 gifts	 to	 his	 guests	 at	 breakfast,	 to	 the	 last	 warm,	 grateful hand-shake	on	the	landing	outside	her	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Were	 you	 in	 the	 school-room,	 Pegler?"	 she	 asked	 kindly.	 "It	 was	 really	 rather charming,	 wasn't	 it?	 Everyone	 happy—the	 children	 and	 the	 old	 people</p>
<p class="calibre1">especially.	And	they	all	 <i class="calibre4">so</i>	enjoyed	Miss	Bubbles'	dressing	up	as	a	witch!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why,	yes,"	said	Pegler	grudgingly.	"It	was	all	very	nice,	ma'am,	in	a	way,	and, as	you	say,	it	all	went	off	very	well.	But	there's	a	queer	rumour	got	about	already, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a>ma'am." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	queer	rumour?	What	d'you	mean,	Pegler?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Quite	a	number	of	the	village	folk	say	that	Mr.	Varick's	late	lady,	the	one	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">used	to	live	here—"	Pegler	stopped	speaking	suddenly,	and	went	on	brushing	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">mistress's	hair	more	vigorously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	 Pegler?"—Miss	 Farrow	 spoke	 with	 a	 touch	 of	 impatience.	 "What	 about Mrs.	Lionel	Varick?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	ma'am,	I	don't	suppose	you'll	credit	it,	but	quite	a	number	of	them	do	say that	her	sperrit	was	there	during	this	afternoon.	One	woman	I	spoke	to,	who	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">school-room	maid	here	a	matter	of	twenty	years	back,	said	she	saw	her	as	clear</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 clear,	 up	 on	 the	 platform,	 wearing	 the	 sort	 of	 grey	 dress	 she	 used	 to	 wear when	 she	 was	 a	 girl,	 ma'am,	 when	 her	 father	 was	 still	 alive.	 None	 of	 the	 men seem	to	have	seen	her—but	quite	a	number	of	the	women	did.	The	post-mistress</p>
<p class="calibre1">says	she	could	have	sworn	to	her	anywhere." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	absolute	nonsense!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	felt	shocked	as	well	as	vexed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	was	when	Mr.	Varick	was	making	that	speech	of	his,"	said	Pegler	slowly.	"If you'll	pardon	me,	ma'am,	for	saying	so,	it	don't	seem	nonsense	to	me.	After	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">I've	seen	myself,	I	can	believe	anything.	Seeing	is	believing,	ma'am." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"People's	eyes	very	often	betray	them,	Pegler.	Haven't	you	sometimes	looked	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	thing	and	thought	it	something	quite	different	from	what	it	really	was?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	I	have,"	acknowledged	Pegler	reluctantly.	"And	of	course,	the	lighting	was very	bad.	Some	of	the	people	hope	that	Mr.	Varick's	going	to	bring	electric	light</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	the	village—d'you	think	he'll	do	that,	ma'am?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	 said	 Miss	 Farrow	 decidedly.	 "I	 shouldn't	 think	 there's	 a	 hope	 of	 it.	 The village	 doesn't	 really	 belong	 to	 him,	 Pegler.	 It	 was	 wonderfully	 kind	 of	 him	 to give	what	he	did	give	to-day,	to	a	lot	of	people	with	whom	he	has	really	nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	do	at	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then,	after	her	maid	had	gone,	Blanche	lay	in	bed,	and	stared	into	the	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">bright	fire.	Her	brain	seemed	abnormally	active,	and	she	found	it	impossible	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">go	 to	 sleep.	 What	 a	 curious,	 uncanny,	 uncomfortable	 story—that	 of	 "poor</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a>Milly's"	ghost	appearing	on	the	little	platform	of	the	village	school-room!	There seems	no	measure,	even	in	these	enlightened	days,	to	what	people	will	say	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	there	flashed	across	her	a	recollection	of	the	fact	that	Bubbles	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">there,	 sitting	 just	 below	 Lionel	 Varick.	 Strange,	 half-forgotten	 stories	 of	 Indian magic—of	 a	 man	 hung	 up	 in	 chains	 padlocked	 by	 British	 officers,	 and	 then,	 a moment	 later,	 that	 same	 man,	 freed,	 standing	 in	 their	 midst,	 the	 chains	 rattling together,	 empty—floated	 through	 Blanche	 Farrow's	 mind.	 Was	 it	 possible	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	 possessed	 uncanny	 powers—powers	 which	 had	 something	 to	 do	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	immemorial	magic	of	the	immemorial	East? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	had	once	heard	the	phenomenon	of	the	vanishing	rope	trick	discussed	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	 length	 between	 a	 number	 of	 clever	 people.	 She	 had	 paid	 very	 little</p>
<p class="calibre1">attention	to	what	had	been	said	at	the	time,	but	she	now	strained	her	memory	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">recapture	the	sense	of	the	words	which	had	been	uttered.	One	of	the	men	present, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a	distinguished	scientist,	had	actually	seen	the	trick	done.	He	had	seen	an	Indian</p>
<p class="calibre1">swarm	 up	 the	 rope	 and	 disappear—into	 thin	 air!	 What	 had	 he	 called	 it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Collective	 hypnotism?	 Yes,	 that	 was	 the	 expression	 he	 had	 used.	 Some	 such</p>
<p class="calibre1">power	 Bubbles	 certainly	 possessed,	 and	 perhaps	 to-day	 she	 had	 chosen	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">exercise	 it	 by	 recalling	 to	 the	 minds	 of	 those	 simple	 village	 folk	 the	 half-forgotten	figure	of	the	one-time	mistress	of	Wyndfell	Hall.	If	she	had	really	done</p>
<p class="calibre1">this,	Bubbles	had	played	an	ungrateful,	cruel	trick	on	Lionel	Varick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	at	last	dropped	off	to	sleep,	but	Pegler's	ridiculous	yet	sinister	story	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">spoilt	the	pleasant	memories	of	her	day,	and	even	her	night,	for	she	slept	badly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	awoke	unrefreshed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	X</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 are	 few	 places	 in	 a	 civilized	 country	 more	 desolate	 than	 a	 big,	 empty country	 railway	 station:	 such	 a	 station	 as	 that	 at	 Newmarket—an	 amusing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">bustling	sight	on	a	race	day;	strangely	still	and	deserted,	even	on	a	fine	summer</p>
<p class="calibre1">day,	 when	 there's	 nothing	 doing	 in	 the	 famous	 little	 town;	 and,	 in	 the	 depth	 of winter,	 extraordinarily	 forlorn.	 The	 solitariness	 and	 the	 desolation	 were	 very marked	on	the	early	afternoon	of	New	Year's	Eve	which	saw	Varick	striding	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 down	 the	 deserted	 platform	 waiting	 for	 Dr.	 Panton,	 and	 Dr.	 Panton's</p>
<p class="calibre1">inseparable	companion,	a	big,	ugly,	intelligent	spaniel	called	Span. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	had	more	than	one	reason	to	be	grateful	to	the	young	medical	man	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">whom	Fate	had	once	thrown	him	into	such	close	contact;	and	so	this	last	spring, </p>
<p class="calibre1">when	Panton	had	had	to	be	in	London	for	a	few	days,	Varick	had	taken	a	deal	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">trouble	to	ensure	that	the	country	doctor	should	have	a	good	time.	But	his	own</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleasure	in	his	friend's	company	had	been	somewhat	spoilt	by	something	Panton</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	then	thought	it	right	to	tell	him.	This	something	was	that	his	late	wife's	one-</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	 companion,	 Miss	 Pigchalke,	 had	 gone	 to	 Redsands,	 and,	 seeking	 out	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">doctor,	had	tried	to	force	him	to	say	that	poor	Mrs.	Varick	had	been	ill-treated—</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	 if	 not	 exactly	 ill-treated,	 then	 neglected—by	 her	 husband,	 during	 her	 last illness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	wouldn't	have	told	you,	but	that	I	think	you	ought	to	know	that	the	woman	has</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	inexplicable	grudge	against	you,"	he	had	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	inexplicable,"	Varick	had	answered	quietly.	"For	Julia	Pigchalke	first	came as	governess	to	Wyndfell	Hall	when	my	wife	was	ten	years	old,	and	she	stayed</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	with	her	ultimately	as	companion—in	fact	as	more	friend	than	companion.	Of</p>
<p class="calibre1">course	I	queered	her	pitch!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then,	rather	hesitatingly,	he	had	gone	on	to	tell	Dr.	Panton	that	he	was	now</p>
<p class="calibre1">paying	 his	 enemy	 an	 annuity	 of	 a	 hundred	 a	 year.	 This	 had	 been	 left	 to	 Miss Pigchalke	in	an	early	will	made	by	his	poor	wife,	but	it	had	not	been	repeated	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 testatrix's	 final	 will,	 as	 Mrs.	 Varick	 had	 fiercely	 resented	 Miss	 Pigchalke's violent	disapproval	of	her	marriage. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a>Panton	had	been	amazed	to	hear	of	Varick's	quite	uncalled-for	generosity,	and	he had	exclaimed,	"Well,	that	does	take	the	cake!	I	wish	I'd	known	this	before.	Still, I	don't	think	Miss	Pigchalke	will	forget	in	a	hurry	what	I	said	to	her.	I	warned	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 some	 of	 the	 things	 she	 said,	 or	 half-said,	 were	 libellous,	 and	 that	 it	 might end	 very	 badly	 for	 her	 if	 she	 said	 them	 again.	 She	 took	 the	 line	 that	 I,	 being	 a doctor,	 was	 privileged—but	 I	 assured	 her	 that	 I	 was	 nothing	 of	 the	 kind!	 Still, she's	a	venomous	old	woman,	and	if	I	were	you	I'd	write	her	a	solicitor's	letter." </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	little	conversation,	which	had	taken	place	more	than	six	months	ago,	came</p>
<p class="calibre1">back,	 word	 for	 word,	 to	 Varick's	 mind,	 as	 he	 walked	 sharply	 up	 and	 down	 the platform,	 trying	 to	 get	 warm.	 It	 was	 strange	 how	 Miss	 Pigchalke	 and	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">vigorous,	unpleasant	personality	haunted	him.	But	he	had	found	in	his	passbook</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	 this	 morning	 that	 she	 had	 already	 cashed	 his	 last	 cheque	 for	 fifty	 pounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Surely	she	couldn't,	in	decency,	go	on	with	this	half-insane	kind	of	persecution	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	accepted	what	was,	after	all,	his	free	and	generous	gift	every	six	months? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	train	came	steaming	in,	and	only	three	passengers	got	out.	But	among	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 the	 man	 for	 whom	 Varick	 was	 waiting.	 And,	 at	 the	 sight	 of	 the	 lithe,	 alert figure	 of	 Dr.	 Panton,	 and	 of	 the	 one-time	 familiar	 form	 of	 good	 old	 Span, Varick's	 troubled,	 uncomfortable	 thoughts	 took	 wings	 to	 themselves	 and	 flew</p>
<p class="calibre1">away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 two	 men's	 hands	 met	 in	 a	 firm,	 friendly	 grasp.	 "This	  <i class="calibre4">is</i>	 jolly,"	 said	 the younger	 of	 the	 two,	 as	 they	 walked	 out	 to	 the	 big	 car.	 "And	 I'm	 ever	 so	 much obliged	to	you	for	letting	me	bring	Span!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	Panton	did	think	it	very	jolly	of	Varick	to	have	left	his	guests,	and	come	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	way	through	the	cold	to	meet	him.	It	was	good	of	him,	too,	to	have	let	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">bring	his	dog. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 they	 drove	 slowly	 through	 the	 picturesque	 High	 Street	 of	 the	 famous	 town, Varick's	 friend	 looked	 about	 him	 with	 keen	 interest	 and	 enjoyment.	 He	 had	 an eager,	intelligent,	alert	mind,	and	he	had	never	been	to	Newmarket	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	 they	 got	 clear	 of	 the	 town,	 and	 were	 speeding	 through	 the	 pleasant, </p>
<p class="calibre1">typically	English	country	lanes	which	give	Suffolk	a	peculiarly	soothing	charm</p>
<p class="calibre1">Span	 (who	 was	 a	 rather	 large	 liver-and-white	 spaniel),	 lying	 stretched	 out</p>
<p class="calibre1">sedately	 at	 their	 feet,	 Varick	 suddenly	 asked	 carelessly:	 "No	 more	 news	 of	 my enemy,	Miss	Pigchalke,	I	suppose?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>Panton	 turned	 to	 him	 quickly	 in	 the	 rushing	 wind:	 "Yes,	 something	  <i class="calibre4">has</i> happened.	 But	 I	 didn't	 think	 it	 worth	 writing	 to	 you	 about.	 An	 extraordinary advertisement	appeared	about	a	month	ago	in	one	of	the	popular	Sunday	papers, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	Mrs.	Bilton—you	remember	the	woman—?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	 shook	 his	 head.	 He	 looked	 exceedingly	 disturbed	 and	 annoyed,	 and	 the man	now	sitting	by	his	side	suddenly	regretted	that	he	had	said	anything	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	absurd	advertisement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mrs.	 Bilton	 was	 the	 woman	 whom	 I	 recommended	 to	 you	 as	 a	 charwoman, </p>
<p class="calibre1">soon	after	you	were	settled	down	at	Redsands." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	I	remember	the	name	now.	What	of	her?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	 came	 up	 to	 see	 me	 one	 evening	 about	 a	 month	 ago,	 and	 she	 brought	 the paper—the	 <i class="calibre4">News	of	the	World</i>	I	think	it	was—with	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,"	 said	 Varick	 shortly.	 "Yes—go	 on,	 Panton.	 What	 was	 in	 the advertisement?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 advertisement	 simply	 asked	 for	 information	 about	 you	 and	 your	 doings, past	and	present,	and	offered	a	reward	for	any	information	of	importance.	It	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	 oddly	 worded.	 What	 I	 should	 call	 an	 amateur	 advertisement.	 Mrs.	 Bilton came	up	to	consult	me	as	to	whether	she	should	write	in	answer	to	it.	Of	course	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">strongly	advised	her	to	do	nothing	of	the	kind.	As	a	matter	of	fact"—Dr.	Panton</p>
<p class="calibre1">chuckled—"I	have	reason	to	believe	she	 <i class="calibre4">did</i>	write,	but	I	need	hardly	say	that,	as far	as	she	was	concerned,	nothing	came	of	it!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	wish	you	could	remember	exactly	how	the	advertisement	was	worded?"	said</p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick.	It	was	clear	that	he	felt	very	much	disturbed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	 sorry	 I	 didn't	 keep	 a	 copy	 of	 it;	 all	 I	 can	 tell	 you	 is	 that	 it	 asked	 for information	 concerning	 the	 past	 life	 and	 career	 of	 Lionel	 Varick,  <i class="calibre4">sometime	 of</i> <i class="calibre4">Redsands	and	Chichester. </i>" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Chichester?"	repeated	Varick	mechanically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 name	 of	 the	 Sussex	 cathedral	 town	 held	 for	 him	 many	 painful,	 sordid</p>
<p class="calibre1">memories.	His	first	wife,	the	woman	whose	very	existence	he	believed	unknown</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	everyone	who	now	knew	him,	with	the	exception	of	Blanche	Farrow,	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 Chichester	 woman.	 It	 was	 there	 that	 they	 had	 lived	 in	 poverty	 and	 angry misery	during	the	last	few	weeks	of	her	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a>"Yes,	that's	all	I	remember—but	I've	put	it	more	clearly	than	the	advertisement did." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	an	extraordinary	thing!"	muttered	Varick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 don't	 know	 that	 it's	 so	 very	 extraordinary.	 It	 was	 that	 woman	 Pigchalke's doing,	obviously.	As	I	told	you	the	last	time	we	met,	I	felt	that	she	would	stick	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing	to	annoy	you.	She's	quite	convinced	that	you're	an	out-and-out	villain." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	 Panton	 laughed.	 He	 really	 couldn't	 help	 it.	 Varick	 was	 such	 a	 thoroughly good	fellow! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	wonder,"	said	Varick	hesitatingly,	"if	I	could	get	a	copy	of	that	Sunday	paper? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	feel	that	it's	the	sort	of	thing	that	ought	to	be	stopped—don't	you,	Panton?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	quite	sure	it	didn't	appear	again	in	the	same	paper,	or	I	should	have	heard	of it	again.	That	one	particular	copy	did	end	by	going	the	whole	round	of	Redsands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 went	 on	 hearing	 about	 it	 for,	 I	 should	 think,—well,	 right	 up	 to	 when	 I	 left home." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	rush	of	blind,	unreasoning	rage	was	shaking	Varick.	Curse	the	woman!	What	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">brute	 she	 must	 be,	 to	 take	 his	 money,	 and	 go	 on	 annoying	 him	 in	 this	 way.	 "I wish	you'd	written	and	told	me	about	it	when	it	happened,"	he	said	sombrely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 doctor	 looked	 at	 him,	 distressed.	 "I'm	 sorry	 I	 didn't,	 if	 you	 feel	 like	 that about	 it!"	 he	 exclaimed.	 "But	 you	 were	 so	 put	 out	 when	 I	 told	 you	 of	 the woman's	 having	 come	 to	 see	 me,	 and	 it	 was	 so	 obvious	 that	 the	 advertisement came	from	her,	that	I	thought	I'd	say	nothing	about	it.	I	wouldn't	have	told	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">now,	only	that	you	mentioned	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	saw	that	his	friend	was	very	much	disturbed.	He	made	a	determined	effort</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	 himself.	 "Never	 mind,"	 he	 said,	 trying	 to	 smile.	 "After	 all,	 it's	 of	 no	 real consequence." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	know	if	you'll	find	it	any	consolation	to	be	told	that	that	sort	of	thing	is by	 no	 means	 uncommon,"	 said	 Panton	 reflectively.	 "People,	 especially	 women, whose	minds	for	any	reason	have	become	just	a	little	unhinged,	often	take	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">sort	 of	 strange	 dislike	 to	 another	 human	 being.	 Sometimes	 for	 no	 reason	 at	 all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every	 medical	 man	 would	 tell	 you	 of	 half-a-dozen	 such	 cases	 within	 his	 own knowledge.	Fortunately,	such	half-insane	people	generally	choose	a	noted	man—</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 Prime	 Minister,	 for	 instance,	 or	 whoever	 happens	 to	 be	 very	 much	 in	 the public	 eye.	 If	 the	 persecution	 becomes	 quite	 intolerable	 there's	 a	 police-court</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a>case—or	the	individual	is	quite	properly	certified	as	insane." </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then	 something	 peculiar	 and	 untoward	 happened	 to	 Lionel	 Varick.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">words	rose	to	his	lips:	"That	horrible	woman	haunts	me—haunts	me!	I	can	never</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	rid	of	her—she	seems	always	there—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had	he	uttered	those	words	aloud,	or	had	he	not?	He	glanced	sharply	round,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">then,	with	relief,	he	made	up	his	mind	that	he	had	 <i class="calibre4">not</i>	uttered	them,	for	the	man sitting	 by	 his	 side	 was	 looking	 straight	 before	 him,	 with	 a	 pleased,	 interested expression	on	his	plain,	intelligent	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	 pulled	 himself	 together.	 This	 would	 never	 do!	 He	 asked	 himself,	 with	 a touch	of	acute	anxiety,	whether	it	were	possible	that	he	was	losing	his	nerve?	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 always	 possessed	 the	 valuable	 human	 gift	 of	 being	 able	 to	 control, </p>
<p class="calibre1">absolutely,	his	secret	feelings	and	his	emotions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did	I	tell	you	that	Miss	Brabazon	is	here?"	he	asked	carelessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 the	 other	 exclaimed:	 "I'm	 glad	 of	 that.	 I	 formed	 a	 tremendously	 high opinion	 of	 that	 girl	 last	 year.	 By	 the	 way,	 I	 was	 surprised	 to	 hear,	 quite	 by accident,	the	other	day,	that	she's	a	lot	of	money.	I	don't	quite	know	why,	but	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">formed	the	impression	that	it	was	her	friend	who	was	well-to-do—didn't	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 never	 thought	 about	 it,"	 said	 Varick	 indifferently.	 "By	 the	 way,	 Miss Brabazon's	old	aunt,	a	certain	Miss	Burnaby,	is	here	too.	It's	rather	a	quiet	party, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Panton;	I	hope	you	won't	be	bored." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	never	bored.	Who	else	have	you	got	staying	with	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	ran	over	the	list	of	his	guests,	only	leaving	out	one,	and,	after	a	scarcely</p>
<p class="calibre1">perceptible	pause,	he	remedied	the	omission. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	there's	Miss	Farrow's	niece;	she	was	called	after	her	aunt,	so	her	real	name is	Blanche—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Known	to	her	friends	as	Bubbles,'"	quoted	Dr.	Panton,	with	a	cynical	inflection in	his	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	do	you	know	that?"	exclaimed	Varick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Because	 there	 was	 a	 portrait	 of	 the	 young	 lady	 in	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Sketch</i>	 last	 week.	 She seems	to	be	a	kind	of	feminine	edition	of	the	Admirable	Crichton.	She	can	act, </p>
<p class="calibre1">dance,	cook—and	she's	famed	as	a	medium	in	the	psychic	world—whatever	that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>may	mean!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	see	you	know	all	about	her,"	observed	Varick,	smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	though	he	was	smiling	at	his	friend,	his	inner	thoughts	were	grim	thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 was	 secretly	 repeating	 to	 himself:	 "Chichester,	 Chichester?	 How	 can	 she have	got	hold	of	 <i class="calibre4">Chichester</i>?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Panton	went	on:	"I'm	glad	I'm	going	to	meet	this	Miss	Bubbles—I've	never</p>
<p class="calibre1">met	 that	 particular	 type	 of	 young	 lady	 before.	 Though,	 of	 course,	 it's	 not,	 as some	people	believe,	a	new	type.	There	have	always	been	girls	of	that	sort	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">civilized	world." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	 quite	 true	 that	 the	 most	 curious	 thing	 about	 Bubbles,"	 said	 Varick thoughtfully,	"is	a	kind	of	thought-reading	gift.	I	fancy	she	must	have	inherited	it from	 an	 Indian	 ancestress,	 for	 her	 great-great-grandfather	 rescued	 a	 begum	 on her	 way	 to	 be	 burnt	 on	 her	 husband's	 funeral	 pyre.	 He	 ultimately	 married	 her, and	 though	 she	 never	 came	 to	 England.	 Bubbles'	 father,	 a	 fool	 called	 Hugh</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dunster,	 who's	 lost	 what	 little	 money	 he	 ever	 had,	 is	 one	 of	 her	 descendants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There's	something	just	a	little	Oriental	and	strange	in	Bubbles'	appearance." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This	 is	 'curiouser	 and	 curiouser,'	 as	 Alice	 in	 Wonderland	 used	 to	 say!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">exclaimed	 Panton.	 "Do	 you	 think	 I	 could	 persuade	 Miss	 Bubbles	 to	 give	 an exhibition	of	her	psychic	gifts?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 speaker	 uttered	 the	 word	 "psychic"	 with	 a	 very	 satiric	 inflection	 in	 his pleasant	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	 smiled	 rather	 wryly.	 "You're	 quite	 likely	 to	 have	 an	 exhibition	 of	 them without	asking	for	it!	The	first	evening	that	my	guests	were	here	she	held	what	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe	 they	 call	 a	 séance,	 and	 as	 a	 result	 Miss	 Brabazon's	 uncle,	 old	 Burnaby, not	only	bolted	from	the	room,	but	left	Wyndfell	Hall	the	next	morning." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	an	extraordinary	thing!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,"	 said	 Varick,	 "it	  <i class="calibre4">was</i>	 an	 extraordinary	 thing.	 I	 confess	 I	 can't	 explain Bubbles'	 gift	 at	 all.	 At	 this	 séance	 of	 hers	 she	 described	 quite	 accurately	 long dead	men	and	women—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are	you	sure	of	that,	Varick?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	course	I	am,	for	she	described	my	own	mother." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a>There	was	a	pause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Being	 a	 very	 intelligent,	 quick	 girl,	 she	 naturally	 helps	 herself	 out	 as	 best	 she can,"	went	on	Varick	reflectively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	you're	inclined	to	think	her	thought-reading	is	more	or	less	a	fraud?"	cried Panton	triumphantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Less,	rather	than	more,	for	she's	convinced	me	that	she	sees	into	the	minds	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	subjects	and	builds	up	a	kind	of—of—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Description?"	suggested	the	doctor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"More	 than	 that—I	 was	 going	 to	 say	 figure.	 She	 described,	 as	 if	 she	 saw	 them standing	 there	 before	 her,	 people	 of	 whom	 she'd	 never	 even	 heard—and	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">descriptions	were	absolutely	exact.	But	if	you	don't	mind,	Panton—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	hesitated,	and	the	other	said,	"Yes,	Varick?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	I'd	rather	you	leave	all	that	sort	of	thing	alone,	as	far	as	Bubbles	Dunster is	concerned.	Both	Miss	Farrow	and	I	are	very	anxious	that	she	shouldn't	be	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	any	more	of	her	tricks	while	she's	here.	People	don't	half	like	it,	you	see.	Even</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I</i>	didn't	like	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somehow	it	was	a	comfort	to	Varick	to	talk	freely	about	Bubbles	to	a	stranger—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	had	got	on	his	nerves.	He	would	have	given	a	good	deal	to	persuade	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	leave	Wyndfell	Hall;	but	he	didn't	know	how	to	set	about	it.	In	a	sense	she	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 soul	 of	 the	 party.	 The	 others	 all	 liked	 her.	 Yet	 he,	 himself,	 felt	 a	 sort	 of growing	repugnance	to	her	which	he	would	have	been	hard	put	to	it	to	explain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed,	the	only	way	he	could	explain	it—and	he	had	thought	a	good	deal	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	the	last	few	days—was	that	she	undoubtedly	possessed	an	uncanny	power	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">starting	into	life	images	which	had	lain	long	dormant	in	his	brain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	one	thing—but	that,	of	course,	might	not	be	entirely	Bubbles'	fault—Milly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">his	poor	wife,	had	become	again	terribly	real	to	him.	It	was	almost	as	if	he	felt</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 to	 be	 alive,	 say,	 in	 the	 next	 room—lying,	 as	 she	 had	 been	 wont	 to	 lie, listening	 for	 his	 footsteps,	 in	 the	 little	 watering	 place	 where	 they	 had	 spent	 the last	few	weeks	of	her	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	could	not	but	put	down	that	unpleasant,	sinister	phenomenon	to	the	presence</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 Bubbles,	 for	 he	 had	 been	 at	 Wyndfell	 Hall	 all	 the	 summer,	 and	 though	 the place	 had	 been	 Milly's	 birthplace—where,	 too,	 she	 had	 spent	 her	 melancholy, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a>dull	 girlhood—no	 thought	 of	 her	 had	 ever	 come	 to	 disturb	 his	 pleasure	 in	 the delightful,	 perfect	 house	 and	 its	 enchanting	 garden.	 Of	 course,	 now	 and	 again some	neighbour	with	whom	he	had	made	acquaintance	would	say	a	word	to	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">indicating	what	a	strange,	solitary	life	the	Faunceys,	father	and	daughter,	had	led</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	their	beautiful	home,	and	how	glad	the	speaker	was	that	"poor	Milly"	had	had a	little	happiness	before	she	died.	To	these	remarks	he,	Varick,	would	of	course</p>
<p class="calibre1">answer	appropriately,	with	 that	touch	of	 sad	reminiscence	which	 carries	with	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	real	regret	or	sorrow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	during	the	last	few	days	it	had	been	otherwise.	He	could	not	get	Milly	out	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 mind,	 and	 he	 had	 come	 to	 feel	 that	 if	 this	 peculiar	 sensation	 continued,	 he would	not	be	able	to	bring	himself	to	stay	on	at	Wyndfell	Hall	after	the	break-up</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	his	present	party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	feeling	of	his	dead	wife's	presence	had	first	become	intolerably	vivid	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">village	school-room	during	the	children's	Christmas	Day	treat.	At	one	time—so</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	clergyman	had	told	him—Milly	had	had	a	sewing-class	for	the	village	girls</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	that	very	room;	but	the	class	had	not	been	a	success,	and	she	had	given	it	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">after	 a	 few	 weeks.	 That	 was	 her	 only	 association	 with	 the	 ugly	 little	 building, and	yet—and	yet,	once	he	had	got	well	into	his	speech,	he	had	suddenly	 <i class="calibre4">felt	her</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">to	be	there</i>—and	it	was	not	the	gentle,	fretful,	adoring	Milly	he	had	known,	but	a Presence	 which	 seemed	 filled	 with	 an	 awful,	 clear-eyed	 knowledge	 of	 certain</p>
<p class="calibre1">secret	 facts	 which	 his	 reasoning	 faculties	 assured	 him	 were	 only	 known	 to	 his own	innermost	self. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	XI</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 turn	 in	 the	 road	 brought	 them	 within	 sight	 of	 Wyndfell	 Hall,	 and—"What	 a singular,	wonderful-looking	old	place!"	exclaimed	Dr.	Panton. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And,	 indeed,	 there	 was	 something	 mysteriously	 alluring	 in	 the	 long,	 gabled</p>
<p class="calibre1">building	 standing	 almost,	 as	 it	 were,	 on	 an	 island,	 among	 the	 high	 trees	 which formed	 a	 screen	 to	 the	 house	 on	 the	 north	 and	 east	 sides.	 It	 was	 something solemn,	something	appealing—like	a	melodious,	plaintive	voice	from	the	long-distant	past,	out	of	that	Old	Country	which	was	the	England	of	six	hundred	years</p>
<p class="calibre1">ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You've	 no	 idea	 how	 beautiful	 this	 place	 is	 in	 summer,	 Panton—and	 yet	 the spring	 is	 almost	 more	 perfect.	 You	 must	 come	 again	 then,	 and	 make	 a	 really good,	long	stay." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Span	will	enjoy	a	swim	in	the	moat	even	now,"	said	the	doctor,	smiling.	They were	 going	 slowly	 over	 the	 narrow	 brick	 bridge,	 and	 so	 up	 to	 the	 deep-eaved porch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	butler	and	footman	appeared	as	if	by	magic,	and	the	sound	of	laughing	voices</p>
<p class="calibre1">floated	from	behind	them.	There	was	a	pleasant	stir	of	life	and	bustle	about	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">delightful	old	house,	or	so	it	seemed	to	the	guest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 jumped	 out	 of	 the	 car	 behind	 his	 host,	 then	 he	 turned	 round.	 "Span!"	 he called	out.	"Span!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 the	 dog	 was	 still	 lying	 on	 the	 floor	 of	 the	 car,	 and	 he	 made	 no	 movement, still	less	any	attempt	to	jump	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	 an	 extraordinary	 thing!"	 exclaimed	 Span's	 master.	 "Come	 down,	 Span! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Come	down	at	once!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 waited	 a	 moment;	 then	 he	 went	 forward	 and	 tried	 to	 drag	 the	 dog	 out.	 But Span	resisted	with	all	his	might.	He	was	a	big	spaniel,	and	Panton,	from	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	stood,	had	no	purchase	on	him.	"There's	something	wrong	with	him,"	he	said with	concern.	"Wait	a	moment,	Varick—if	you	don't	mind." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a>He	 got	 up	 into	 the	 car	 again	 and	 patted	 Span's	 head.	 The	 dog	 turned	 his	 head slowly,	and	licked	his	master's	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now,	Span,	jump	out!	There's	a	good	dog!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Span	never	moved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	last	Panton	managed	to	half-shove,	half-tumble	the	dog	out.	"I've	only	known</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	behave	like	this	once	before,"	he	muttered,	"and	that	was	with	a	poor	mad woman	whom	I	was	once	compelled	to	put	up	in	my	house	for	two	or	three	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	simply	wouldn't	go	near	her!	He	behaved	just	as	he's	doing	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Span	was	lying	on	the	ground	before	them,	inert,	almost	as	if	dead.	But	his	eyes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">his	troubled,	frightened	eyes,	were	very	much	alive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	went	off	into	the	house	for	a	moment.	He	had	never	liked	dogs;	and	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">ugly	brute's	behaviour,	so	he	told	himself,	annoyed	him	very	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Span	got	up	and	shook	himself,	almost	as	if	he	had	been	asleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Panton	 bent	 down.	 "Span,"	 he	 said	 warningly,	 "be	 a	 good	 dog	 and	 behave yourself!	 Remember	 what	 happened	 to	 you	 after	 the	 poor	 lunatic	 lady	 went</p>
<p class="calibre1">away." </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 Span	 looked	 up	 with	 that	 peculiar,	 thoughtful	 look	 which	 dogs	 sometimes have	of	understanding	everything	which	is	being	said	to	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Span	had	been	beaten—a	very	rare	experience	for	him—after	the	mad	lady	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">left	the	doctor's	house.	But	whether	he	understood	or	not	the	exact	reference	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 odious	 episode	 in	 his	 happy	 past	 life,	 there	 was	 no	 doubt	 that	 Span	 did understand	that	his	master	regarded	him	as	being	in	disgrace;	and	it	was	a	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">subdued	 dog	 that	 walked	 sedately	 into	 the	 hall	 where	 most	 of	 the	 party	 were gathered	together	ready	to	greet	the	new-comer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Farrow	was	particularly	cordial,	and	so	was	Helen	Brabazon.	She	and	Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Panton	had	become	real	friends	during	Mrs.	Varick's	illness,	and	they	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	one	in	their	affection	for,	and	admiration	of,	Lionel	Varick	during	that	piteous</p>
<p class="calibre1">time.	To	the	doctor	(though	he	would	not	have	admitted	it,	even	to	himself,	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 world)	 there	 had	 been	 something	 very	 repugnant	 about	 the	 dying	 woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though	still	young	in	years,	she	might	have	been	any	age;	and	she	was	so	fretful</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 so	 selfish,	 hardly	 allowing	 her	 husband	 out	 of	 her	 sight,	 while	 utterly devoted	to	him,	of	course,	in	her	queer,	egoistic	way—and	to	Miss	Brabazon,	her</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a>kind	new	friend.	The	doctor	had	soon	realized	that	it	was	the	pity	which	is	akin to	 love	 which	 had	 made	 Helen	 become	 so	 attached	 to	 poor	 Milly	 Varick—</p>
<p class="calibre1">intense	 pity	 for	 the	 unhappy	 soul	 who	 was	 going	 to	 lose	 her	 new-found</p>
<p class="calibre1">happiness.	Milly's	pathetic	cry:	"I	never	had	a	girl	friend	before.	You	can't	think how	happy	it	makes	me!"	had	touched	Helen	to	the	heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Standing	 there,	 in	 that	 noble	 old	 room	 hung	 with	 some	 beautiful	 tapestries</p>
<p class="calibre1">forming	 a	 perfect	 background	 to	 the	 life	 and	 colour	 which	 was	 now	 filling	 it, Panton	 was	 surprised	 to	 find	 how	 vividly	 those	 memories	 of	 last	 autumn	 came surging	back	to	him.	It	must	be	owing	to	this	meeting	with	Miss	Brabazon—this</p>
<p class="calibre1">reunion	 with	 the	 two	 people	 with	 whom	 he	 had	 gone	 through	 an	 experience</p>
<p class="calibre1">which,	though	it	so	often	befalls	a	kind	and	sympathetic	doctor,	yet	never	loses</p>
<p class="calibre1">its	poignancy—that	he	was	thinking	now	so	intensely	of	poor	Mrs.	Varick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	Helen	Brabazon	who	had	introduced	the	new-comer	to	Miss	Farrow,	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	 had	 disappeared,	 and	 soon	 Dr.	 Panton	 was	 looking	 round	 him	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">interest	 and	 curiosity.	 Most	 of	 the	 people	 whom	 he	 knew	 to	 be	 staying	 at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wyndfell	 Hall	 were	 present,	 but	 not	 the	 girl	 his	 friend	 had	 described—not	 the girl,	 that	 is,	 whose	 portrait	 he	 had	 seen	 in	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Sketch</i>.	 Just	 as	 he	 was	 telling himself	this,	a	door	opened,	and	two	people	came	through	together—a	tall,	fair, </p>
<p class="calibre1">smiling	young	man,	and	a	quaint,	slender	figure,	looking	like	a	child	rather	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	a	woman,	whose	pale,	yet	vivid	little	face	was	framed	in	thick,	dark	brown, </p>
<p class="calibre1">bobbed	hair,	and	whose	large,	bright	eyes	gleamed	mischievously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	had	chosen	to	put	on	this	afternoon	a	long,	rose-red	knitted	jumper	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 yellow	 skirt,	 and	 she	 looked	 as	 if	 she	 had	 stepped	 out	 from	 some	 ancient Spanish	religious	procession. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bubbles,"	 called	 out	 her	 aunt,	 "this	 is	 Dr.	 Panton.	 Come	 and	 be	 introduced	 to him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 something	 very	 odd	 happened.	 Varick	 joined	 his	 new	 guest	 at	 the	 very</p>
<p class="calibre1">same	 moment	 that	 the	 girl	 came	 forward	 with	 hand	 outstretched	 and	 a	 polite word	of	welcome	on	her	lips;	but,	before	she	could	speak,	Span,	who	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">behaving	 with	 so	 sedate	 a	 dignity	 that	 the	 people	 present	 were	 scarcely</p>
<p class="calibre1">conscious	of	his	existence,	gave	a	sudden	loud	and	horrible	howl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	master,	disregarding	Bubbles'	outstretched	hand,	seized	the	dog	by	the	collar, </p>
<p class="calibre1">rushed	with	him	to	the	door	giving	on	to	the	porch,	and	thrust	him	out	into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cold	and	darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>Span	remained	quite	quiet	when	on	the	wrong	side	of	the	door.	There	might	have been	no	dog	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	 so	 sorry,"	 said	 Panton	 apologetically,	 as	 he	 came	 again	 towards	 the	 tea-table.	 "I	 can't	 think	 what's	 the	 matter	 with	 the	 poor	 brute.	 He's	 almost	 perfect manners	as	a	rule." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 turned	 to	 Miss	 Brabazon,	 who	 laughingly	 exclaimed:	 "Yes,	 indeed!	 Span's such	an	 old	 friend	of	 mine	 that	I	 feel	 quite	 hurt.	I	 thought	 he	would	 be	 sure	to take	some	 notice	 of	me;	 but	 I	didn't	 even	 know	 he	was	 there	 till	he	 set	 up	 that awful,	unearthly	howl." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	think	it's	very	cruel	to	have	turned	the	dog	out	into	the	cold,"	Bubbles	said	in her	 quick,	 decided	 way.	 "There's	 nothing	 about	 dogs	 I	 don't	 know,	 Doctor—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Doctor—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"—Panton,"	he	said	shortly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	 Panton?	 May	 I	 go	 out	 to	 him,	 Dr.	 Panton?"	 There	 was	 a	 challenge	 in	 her tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Panton	 answered	 stiffly:	 "By	 all	 means.	 But	 Span's	 not	 always	 pleasant	 with complete	strangers;	and	he	prefers	men,	Miss	Dunster." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	think	he'll	be	all	right	with	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	 went	 and	 opened	 the	 door,	 and	 a	 moment	 later	 they	 heard	 her	 low, </p>
<p class="calibre1">throaty	voice	talking	caressingly	to	the	dog.	Span	whined,	but	in	a	gentle,	happy</p>
<p class="calibre1">way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	quite	good	now,"	she	called	out	triumphantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	turned	to	the	company:	"Will	you	forgive	me	for	a	moment?"	he	said.	"I forgot	to	say	a	word	to	my	chauffeur	about	our	plans	for	to-morrow."	And	as	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">went	through	one	door,	Bubbles,	followed	by	the	now	good	and	repentant	Span, </p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared	through	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	 a	 darling,"	 she	 cried	 enthusiastically.	 "One	 of	 the	 nicest	 dogs	 I've	 ever met!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sat	down,	and	endeared	herself	further	to	Span	by	giving	him	a	large	piece</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	cake. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>And	Dr.	Panton,	looking	at	the	charming	group—for	the	lithe,	dark-haired	girl	in her	brilliant,	quaint	garment,	and	the	dog	over	which	she	was	bending,	made	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">delightful	 group—told	 himself	 grudgingly	 that	 Miss	 Bubbles	 was	 curiously</p>
<p class="calibre1">attractive:	 far	 more	 attractive-looking	 than	 he	 would	 have	 thought	 her	 to	 be	 by the	 portrait	 published	 in	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Sketch</i>—though	 even	 that	 had	 been	 sufficiently arresting	to	remain	in	his	mind	for	two	or	three	days.	Was	there	really	something</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eastern	about	her	appearance?	He	would	never	have	thought	it	but	for	those	few</p>
<p class="calibre1">words	 of	 Varick's.	 Many	 English	 girls	 have	 that	 clear	 olive	 complexion,	 those large,	shadowy	dark	eyes,	which	yet	can	light	up	into	daring,	fun,	and	mischief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But,	 alas!	 the	 story	 of	 Span—even	 this	 early	 chapter	 of	 the	 story	 of	 his	 stay	 at Wyndfell	Hall—had	not	a	happy	ending.	As	Varick	came	forward	again	among</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 guests,	 Span	 once	 more	 set	 up	 that	 sharp,	 uncanny	 howl,	 and	 this	 time	 he cringed	and	shivered,	as	well	as	howled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Span's	master,	with	an	angry	exclamation,	again	dragged	the	now	resisting	dog</p>
<p class="calibre1">across	to	the	door	which	led	into	the	outer	porch.	After	he	had	shut	the	door,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Span's	 howls	 were	 heard	 subsiding,	 he	 turned	 to	 the	 others	 apologetically.	 "I'm really	awfully	sorry,"	he	exclaimed.	"If	this	sort	of	thing	goes	on	I'll	have	to	send him	home	to-morrow." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poor	 Panton	 looked	 thoroughly	 put	 out	 and	 annoyed.	 But	 Bubbles	 came	 to	 his rescue—Bubbles	 and	 the	 young	 man	 whom	 the	 doctor	 now	 knew	 to	 be	 Bill</p>
<p class="calibre1">Donnington. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come	on,	Bill!	We'll	take	him	round	to	the	kitchen.	You	don't	mind,	do	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Span's	owner	shook	his	head;	devoted	though	he	was	to	his	dog,	he	felt	he	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">well	do	without	Span	for	a	while. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 Bubbles	 and	 Donnington	 had	 disappeared	 together,	 their	 eager	 voices</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	be	heard	from	the	paved	court-yard	which	connected	two	of	the	wings	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wyndfell	 Hall.	 Span	 was	 barking	 now,	 barking	 eagerly,	 happily,	 confidently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	when	the	two	young	people	reappeared	they	were	both	laughing. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a>"He's	 taken	 to	 the	 cook	 tremendously,"	 said	 Bubbles.	 "And	 he's	 even	 made friends—and	that's	much	more	wonderful—with	the	cat.	He	went	straight	up	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	and	smelt	her,	and	she	seemed	to	be	quite	pleased	with	the	attention." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	turned	to	Dr.	Panton:	"I'll	go	out	presently	and	see	how	he's	getting	on,"	she added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	at	her	gratefully.	She	really	was	a	nice	girl!	He	had	thought	that	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 be	 one	 of	 those	 disagreeable,	 forward,	 self-sufficing,	 modern	 young</p>
<p class="calibre1">women,	who	are	absorbed	only	in	themselves,	and	in	the	effect	they	produce	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">other	people.	But	Miss	Bubbles	was	not	in	the	least	like	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	Brabazon	whispered,	smiling:	"Isn't	Bubbles	Dunster	a	dear,	Dr.	Panton? </p>
<p class="calibre1">She's	not	like	anyone	I	ever	met	before—and	that	makes	her	all	the	nicer,	doesn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	XII</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">About	an	hour	after	Dr.	Panton's	arrival,	the	whole	of	the	party	was	more	or	less</p>
<p class="calibre1">scattered	through	the	delightful	old	house,	with	the	exception	of	Lionel	Varick, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who	had	gone	off	to	the	village	by	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	the	four	ladies	finally	gathered	together	in	the	hall	to	put	in	the	time	between</p>
<p class="calibre1">tea	and	dinner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	 Burnaby	 was	 soon	 nodding	 over	 a	 book	 close	 to	 the	 fire,	 while	 Helen</p>
<p class="calibre1">Brabazon	and	Blanche	Farrow	had	brought	down	their	work.	This	consisted,	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">far	 as	 Helen	 was	 concerned,	 of	 a	 complicated	 baby's	 garment	 destined	 for	 the Queen's	Needlework	Guild.	Blanche,	sitting	close	to	Helen,	was	bending	over	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">frame	 containing	 the	 intricate	 commencement	 of	 a	 fruit	 and	 bird	  <i class="calibre4">petit-point</i> picture,	which,	when	finished,	she	intended	should	form	a	banner	screen	for	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three	 seven-branched	 silver	 candlesticks	 had	 now	 been	 lighted,	 and	 formed</p>
<p class="calibre1">pools	of	soft	radiance	in	the	gathering	dusk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	wandering	about	restlessly	for	a	while,	Bubbles	ensconced	herself	far	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 the	 others,	 in	 the	 old	 carved	 wood	 confessional,	 which	 had	 seemed	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Donnington's	 eyes	 so	 incongruous	 and	 unsuitable	 an	 object	 to	 form	 part	 of	 the furnishings	of	a	living	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	Blanche	Farrow,	the	confessional,	notwithstanding	the	beauty	of	the	carving, </p>
<p class="calibre1">suggested	 an	 irreverent	 simile—that	 of	 a	 telephone-box.	 She	 told	 herself	 that only	Bubbles	would	have	chosen	such	an	uncomfortable	resting-place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	when	stepping	up	into	what	had	once	been	the	priest's	narrow	seat,	Bubbles</p>
<p class="calibre1">called	 out	 that	 it	 was	 delightfully	 nice	 and	 quiet	 in	 there,	 as	 well	 as	 dark—for there	still	hung	over	the	aperture	through	which	she	had	just	passed	a	curtain	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">green	silk	brocade	embroidered	with	pale	passion	flowers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	followed	a	period	of	absolute	silence	and	quietude	in	the	room.	Then	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">door	leading	from	the	outside	porch	opened,	and	Varick	came	in.	"I	hope	I'm	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">intruding,"	 he	 exclaimed	 in	 his	 full,	 resonant	 voice;	 and	 the	 ladies,	 with	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a>exception	of	Bubbles,	who	remained	invisible,	looked	up	and	eagerly	welcomed him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During	 the	 last	 few	 days	 he	 had	 made	 a	 real	 conquest	 of	 Miss	 Burnaby,	 who, with	 the	 one	 startling	 exception	 of	 the	 emotion	 betrayed	 by	 her	 at	 the	 séance, secretly	struck	both	him	and	Blanche	Farrow	as	the	most	commonplace	human</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	with	whom	either	had	ever	come	in	contact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	quite	warm,"	he	said,	in	answer	to	the	old	lady's	invitation	to	come	up	to	the fire.	"I	had	to	go	down	to	the	village	Post	Office	to	see	why	the	London	papers</p>
<p class="calibre1">hadn't	arrived.	But	I've	got	them	all	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	came	over	to	where	she	was	sitting	and	handed	her	a	picture	paper.	Then	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">retreated,	 far	 from	 the	 fire,	 close	 to	 a	 table	 which	 was	 equi-distant	 from	 the confessional	and	the	door	giving	access	to	the	staircase	hall.	Bringing	forward	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">deep,	comfortable	chair	out	of	the	shadows,	he	sat	down,	and	opening	one	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">newspapers	he	had	brought	in,	began	to	read	it	with	close	attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 the	 table	 at	 his	 elbow,	 there	 now	 stood	 what	 looked	 to	 Helen's	 eyes	 like	 a bouquet	 of	 light.	 But	 this	 only	 made	 the	 soft	 darkness	 which	 filled	 the	 further side	of	the	great	room	seem	more	intense	to	those	sitting	near	the	fireplace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 were	 all	 pleasantly	 tired	 after	 the	 doings	 of	 the	 day;	 and	 soon	 Blanche's quick	 ears	 caught	 a	 faint,	 regular	 sound	 issuing	 from	 the	 far-off	 confessional. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles,	so	much	was	clear,	had	fallen	asleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then,	not	for	the	first	time	in	the	last	few	days,	the	aunt	began	considering</p>
<p class="calibre1">within	herself	the	problem	of	her	niece.	Blanche	had	begun	to	like	Donnington</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	a	cordiality	of	liking	which	surprised	herself.	His	selfless	love	for	the	girl</p>
<p class="calibre1">touched	her	more	than	she	had	thought	it	possible	for	anything	now	to	touch	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">worldly	 heart.	 And	 whereas	 she	 would	 naturally	 have	 considered	 a	 marriage</p>
<p class="calibre1">between	the	penniless	Donnington	and	brilliant,	clever,	popular	Bubbles	as	being</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	of	the	question,	she	was	beginning	to	feel	that	such	a	marriage	might	be,	nay, </p>
<p class="calibre1">almost	 certainly	 was,	 the	 only	 thing	 likely	 to	 ensure	 for	 Bubbles	 a	 reasonably happy	and	normal	life.	Blanche	Farrow	knew	enough	of	human	nature	to	realize</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 the	 kind	 of	 love	 Bill	 Donnington	 felt	 for	 her	 strange	 little	 niece	 was	 of	 a high	 and	 rare	 quality.	 It	 was	 very	 unlike	 the	 usual	 selfish,	 acquisitive	 love	 of	 a man	for	a	maid.	It	was	more	like	the	tender,	watching,	tireless	devotion	certain</p>
<p class="calibre1">mothers	have	for	their	children—it	was	infinitely	protecting,	infinitely	forgiving, </p>
<p class="calibre1">infinitely	understanding. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a>Blanche	sighed,	a	long,	deep	sigh,	as	she	told	herself	sadly	that	no	one	had	ever loved	  <i class="calibre4">her</i>	 like	 that—not	 even	 her	 old	 friend	 Mark	 Gifford.	 He	 had	 loved	 her long;	in	fact	he	rarely	saw	her,	even	now,	without	asking	her	to	marry	him.	Also</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	had	been,	in	his	own	priggish	way,	a	very,	very	good	and	useful	friend	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	still,	Blanche	knew,	deep	in	her	heart,	that	Mark	Gifford	disapproved	of	her, </p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 he	 often	 misunderstood	 her,	 that	 he	 was	 ashamed	 of	 the	 strength	 of	 the attraction	which	made	him	still	wish	to	make	her	his	wife,	and	which	had	kept</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	a	bachelor.	As	long	as	this	old	friend	had	known	her	he	had	always	written</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 a	 Christmas	 letter.	 The	 letter	 had	 not	 come	 this	 Christmas,	 and	 she	 had missed	it.	But	Mark	had	no	idea	of	where	she	was,	and—and	after	all,	perhaps</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	faithful	friendship	had	waned	at	last	from	lack	of	real	response. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then,	 while	 thinking	 these	 rather	 melancholy,	 desultory	 thoughts,	 Blanche Farrow	 suddenly	 experienced	 a	 very	 peculiar	 sensation.	 It	 was	 that	 of	 finding herself	as	if	impelled	to	look	up	from	the	embroidery-frame	over	which	she	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">bending. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	did	look	up;	and	for	a	moment	her	heart—that	heart	which	the	way	of	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">life	 had	 so	 atrophied	 and	 hardened—seemed	 to	 stop	 beating,	 for	 just	 behind</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lionel	Varick,	whose	head	was	still	bent	over	his	newspaper	with	a	complete	air</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 unconcern,	 interest,	 and	 ease—stood,	 or	 appeared	 to	 stand,	 two	 shadowy</p>
<p class="calibre1">figures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 shut	 her	 eyes;	 then	 opened	 them	 again—wide.  <i class="calibre4">The	figures	were	still	there</i>, and	they	had	grown	clearer,	more	definite,	especially	the	countenance	of	each	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 two	 wraith-like	 women	 who	 stood,	 like	 sentinels,	 one	 on	 either	 side	 of	 the seated	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	 gazed	 at	 them	 fixedly	 for	 what	 seemed	 to	 her	 an	 eternity	 of	 time.	 But even	 while,	 in	 a	 way,	 she	 could	 not	 deny	 the	 evidence	 of	 her	 senses,	 she	 was telling	 herself	 that	 she	 was	 really	 seeing	  <i class="calibre4">nothing</i>—that	 this	 extraordinary experience	was	but	another	exercise	of	Bubbles'	uncanny	power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	as	she,	literally	not	believing	the	evidence	of	her	senses,	stared	at	the	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">immobile	figures,	her	eyes	became	focussed	on	the	face	of	the	woman	standing</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 Varick's	 right.	 There	 was	 a	 coarse	 beauty	 in	 the	 mask-like-looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">countenance,	but	it	was	a	beauty	now	instinct	with	a	kind	of	stark	ferocity	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">rage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 last	 she	 slowly	 concentrated	 her	 gaze	 on	 the	 other	 luminous	 figure.	 Though swathed	from	neck	to	heel	in	what	Blanche	told	herself,	with	a	peculiar	feeling</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a>of	horror,	were	old-fashioned	grave-clothes,	the	second	woman	yet	looked	more <i class="calibre4">real</i>,	more	 <i class="calibre4">alive</i>,	than	the	other.	Her	face,	if	deadly	pale,	was	less	mask-like,	and the	 small,	 dark	 eyes	 gleamed,	 while	 the	 large,	 ill-shaped	 mouth	 seemed	 to	 be quivering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then,	all	at	once,	the	form	to	Varick's	right	began	to	dissolve—to	melt,	as	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">were,	into	the	green-grey	and	blue	tapestry	which	hung	across	the	farther	wall	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	while	this	curious	phenomenon	took	place,	the	woman	swathed	in	her	grave-</p>
<p class="calibre1">clothes	remained	quite	clearly	visible.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly	Helen	Brabazon	started	to	her	feet;	she	uttered	a	loud	and	terrible	cry</p>
<p class="calibre1">—and	at	that	same	moment	Blanche	saw	the	more	living	and	sinister	of	the	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">apparitions	also	become	disintegrated,	and	quickly	dissolve	into	nothingness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lionel	Varick	leapt	from	his	chair.	His	face	changed	from	a	placid	gravity	to	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	surprise	and	distress.	"What	is	it?"	he	cried,	coming	forward.	"What	is	it,	Miss Brabazon—Helen?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girl	whom	he	addressed	fell	back	into	her	chair.	She	covered	her	face	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 hands.	 Twice	 she	 opened	 her	 lips	 and	 tried	 to	 speak—in	 vain.	 At	 last	 she gasped	out,	"It's	all	right	now.	I'll	be	better	in	a	minute." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	what	happened?"	exclaimed	Varick.	"Did	anything	happen?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 think	 I	 must	 have	 gone	 to	 sleep	 without	 knowing	 it—for	 I've	 had	 a	 terrible, terrible—nightmare!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Burnaby	got	up	slowly,	deliberately,	from	her	chair	near	the	fire.	She	also</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	up	to	her	niece. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	were	working	up	to	the	very	moment	you	cried	out,"	she	said	positively.	"I had	turned	round	and	I	was	watching	you—when	suddenly	you	jumped	up	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">gave	that	dreadful	cry." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	tell	us	what	frightened	you,"	said	Varick	solicitously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Please	don't	ask	me	what	I	saw—or	thought	I	saw;	I	would	rather	not	tell	you," </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	said	in	a	low	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	of	course	you	must	tell	us!"	Miss	Burnaby	roused	herself,	and	spoke	with	a good	deal	of	authority.	"If	you	are	not	well	you	ought	to	see	a	doctor,	my	dear</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a>child." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	 burst	 into	 bitter	 sobs.	 "I	 thought	 I	 saw	 Milly,	 Mr.	 Varick—poor,	 poor Milly!	 She	 looked	 exactly	 as	 she	 looked	 when	 I	 last	 saw	 her,	 in	 her	 coffin, excepting	that	her	eyes	were	open.	She	was	standing	just	behind	you—and	oh,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">shall	 never,	 never	 forget	 her	 look!	 It	 was	 a	 terrible,	 terrible	 look—a	 look	 of hatred.	Yet	I	cared	for	her	so	much!	You	know	I	did	all	that	was	possible	for	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman	to	do	for	another	during	those	few	weeks	that	I	knew	her?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lionel	Varick's	face	turned	a	curious,	greyly	pallid	tint.	It	was	as	if	all	the	natural colour	was	drained	out	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where's	Bubbles?"	he	asked,	in	a	scarcely	audible	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	moment	no	one	answered	him,	and	then	Blanche	said	quietly:	"Bubbles	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	there,	in	the	confessional,	asleep." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 turned	 and	 walked	 quickly	 over	 to	 the	 carved,	 box-like	 confessional,	 and drew	aside	the	green-embroidered	curtain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes,	the	girl	lay	there	asleep—or	was	she	only	pretending?	Her	breast	rose	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">fell,	her	eyes	were	closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	took	hold	of	her	arm	with	no	gentle	gesture,	and	she	awoke	with	a	cry	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">surprise	 and	 pain.	 "What	 is	 it?	 Don't	 do	 that!"	 she	 said	 in	 a	 hoarse	 and	 sleepy tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then,	 on	 seeing	 who	 it	 was,	 she	 smiled	 wryly.	 "Is	 it	 forbidden	 to	 get	 in here?"	 she	 asked,	 still	 speaking	 in	 a	 heavy,	 dull	 way.	 "I	 didn't	 know	 it	 was,"—</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	stumblingly	she	stepped	down	out	of	the	confessional. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	 scowled	 at	 her,	 and	 made	 no	 answer	 to	 her	 question.	 Together	 they</p>
<p class="calibre1">walked	over	to	where	the	other	three	were	standing—Miss	Burnaby	still	gazing</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	her	niece,	with	an	annoyed,	frightened	expression	on	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Bubbles	and	Varick	came	up	to	her,	Helen	got	up	from	the	chair	in	which	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 sunk	 back.	 She	 held	 a	 handkerchief	 to	 her	 face,	 and	 was	 making	 a	 great effort	to	regain	her	self-control	and	composure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Please	forgive	me,	Mr.	Varick.	I	oughtn't	to	have	told	you	what	I	thought	I	saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">—for	 I'm	 sure	 it	 was	 only	 a	 dream,	 a	 horrible,	 startling	 dream.	 But—but	 you made	me	tell	you,	didn't	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a>She	 looked	 up	 into	 his	 pale,	 convulsed	 face	 with	 an	 anguished	 expression.	 "I think	I'll	go	upstairs	now,	and	rest	a	little	before	I	dress	for	dinner,"	and	then	she walked	across	the	room,	and	out	of	the	door,	with	a	steady	step. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	 stretched	 out	 her	 arms	 with	 a	 weary	 gesture.	 "What's	 all	 this	 fuss about?"	she	asked.	"I	feel	absolutely	done—done—done!	Not	at	all	as	if	I'd	had a	good	long	sleep.	I	wonder	how	long	I	 <i class="calibre4">was</i>	asleep?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	 didn't	 sleep	 very	 long,"	 said	 her	 aunt	 dryly—"not	 half-an-hour	 in	 all.	 I should	 advise	 you,	 Bubbles,	 to	 follow	 Miss	 Brabazon's	 example—go	 up	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	a	good	rest,	before	getting	ready	for	dinner." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	turned	away.	She	walked	very	slowly,	with	dragging	steps,	to	the	door; </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	a	moment	later	Miss	Burnaby	also	left	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	walked	over	towards	the	fireplace.	He	held	out	his	hands	to	the	flames—</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	felt	cold,	shiveringly	cold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 turned,	 as	 he	 had	 so	 often	 done	 in	 the	 past,	 for	 comfort	 to	 the	 woman	 now standing	 silent	 by	 his	 side,	 and	 who	 knew	 at	 once	 so	 much	 and	 so	 little	 of	 his real	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 wonder	 what	 really	 happened?"	 he	 muttered.	 "It	 was	 a	 most	 extraordinary thing!	 I've	 seldom	 met	 anyone	 so	 little	 hysterical	 or	 fanciful	 as—as	 is	 Miss Brabazon."	 And	 then:	 "Why,	 Blanche,"	 he	 exclaimed,	 startled,	 "what's	 the matter?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	look	on	her	face	he	had	never	seen	there	before—a	very	troubled, </p>
<p class="calibre1">questioning,	perplexed	look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 saw	 something	 too,	 Lionel,"	 she	 said	 in	 a	 low	 voice;	 "I—I	 saw	 more	 than Helen	Brabazon	admits	to	having	seen." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"  <i class="calibre4">You</i>	saw	something?"	he	echoed	incredulously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	and	were	it	not	that	I	am	an	older	woman,	and	have	more	self-control	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	young	friend,	I	should	have	cried	out	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	 <i class="calibre4">did</i>	you	see?"	he	asked	slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	I	think	I	saw—for	I	am	quite	convinced	that	I	saw	nothing	at	all,	and	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	extraordinary	phenomenon	or	vision,	call	it	what	you	will,	was	only	another</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 Bubbles'	 tricks—what	 I	 saw—"	 She	 stopped	 dead.	 She	 found	 it</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a>extraordinarily	difficult	to	go	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes?"	he	said	sharply.	"Please	tell	me,	Blanche.	What	is	it	you	saw,	or	thought you	saw?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 thought	 I	 saw	  <i class="calibre4">two</i>	 women	 standing	 just	 behind	 your	 chair,"	 she	 said deliberately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	made	a	violent	movement—so	violent	that	it	knocked	over	a	rather	solid</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	 oak	 stool	 which	 always	 stood	 before	 the	 fire.	 "I	 beg	 your	 pardon!"	 he exclaimed;	 and,	 stooping,	 picked	 the	 stool	 up	 again.	 Then,	 "What	 sort	 of women?"	he	asked;	and	though	he	tried	to	speak	lightly,	he	failed,	and	knew	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">failed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	isn't	very	easy	to	describe	them,"	she	said	reluctantly.	"The	one	was	a	stout young	woman,	with	a	gipsy	type	of	face—that's	the	best	way	I	can	describe	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	the	other—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	waited	a	full	minute,	but	Varick	did	not,	could	not,	speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	went	on:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 other,	 Lionel,	 looked	 more	 like—well,	 like	 what	 a	 ghost	 is	 supposed	 to look	 like!	 She	 was	 swathed	 in	 white	 from	 head	 to	 foot,	 and	 she	 appeared—I don't	 quite	 know	 how	 to	 describe	 it—as	 if	 at	 once	 alive	 and	 dead.	 Her	 face looked	dead,	but	her	eyes	looked	alive." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Had	you	ever	seen	either	of	these	women	before—I	mean	in	life?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	turned	away	from	her,	and	was	staring	into	the	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No;	I've	never	seen	anyone	in	the	least	like	either	of	them." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	moved	a	few	steps,	and	then,	as	if	hardly	knowing	what	he	was	doing,	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">began	 turning	 over	 the	 leaves	 of	 the	 picture	 paper	 Miss	 Burnaby	 had	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">reading. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	you	suppose	that	Helen	Brabazon	saw	exactly	what	you	saw?"	he	asked	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">last. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	 I'm	 sure	 she	 didn't;	 for	 the	 younger-looking	 woman	 had	 already</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappeared,	 it	 was	 as	 if	 she	 faded	 into	 nothingness,	 before	 Helen	 Brabazon called	 out,"—there	 was	 a	 hesitating,	 dubious	 tone	 in	 Blanche's	 voice.	 "But	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a>course	 we	 can't	 tell	 what	 exactly	 she	 did	 see.	 She	 may	 have	 seen	 something—</p>
<p class="calibre1">someone—quite	different	from	what	I	thought	I	saw." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	began	staring	into	the	fire	again,	and	Blanche	felt	intolerably	nervous	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">uncomfortable.	 "I	 think,	 Lionel,	 that	 I	 must	 speak	 to	 Bubbles	 very	 seriously!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 said	 at	 last.	 "I	 haven't	 a	 doubt	  <i class="calibre4">now</i>	 that	 she	 really	 has	 got	 some	 uncanny power—a	 power	 of	 stirring	 the	 imagination—of	 making	 those	 about	 her	 think</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	see	visions." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	 why	 should	 she	 have	 chosen	 that	 you	 should	 see	 such—such	 a	 vision	 as that?"	he	asked,	almost	in	a	whisper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah,	 there	 you	 have	 me!	 I	 can't	 imagine	 what	 should	 prompt	 her	 to	 do	 such	 a cruel,	unseemly	thing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	 think	 it's	 quite	 impossible	 that	 Bubbles	 personated	 either	 of	 these—</p>
<p class="calibre1">these"—he	 hesitated	 for	 a	 word,	 and	 Blanche	 answered	 his	 only	 half-asked question	very	decidedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	 there'd	 been	 only	 one	 figure	 there,	 I	 confess	 I	 should	 have	 thought	 that Bubbles	had	in	some	way	dressed	up,	and	'worked	it.'	You	know	how	fond	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">used	to	be	of	practical	jokes?	But	there	were	two	forms—absolutely	distinct	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	from	the	other." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lionel	Varick	took	a	turn	up	and	down	the	long	room.	Then	he	came	and	stood</p>
<p class="calibre1">opposite	to	her,	and	she	was	shocked	at	the	change	in	his	face.	He	looked	as	if	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	been	through	some	terrible	physical	experience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	wish	you'd	arrange	for	her	to	go	away,	at	once—I	mean,	to-morrow.	Forgive</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	for	saying	such	a	thing,	but	I	feel	that	nothing	will	go	right	while	Bubbles	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	Wyndfell	Hall,"	he	exclaimed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	looked	what	he	had	never	seen	her	look	before—offended.	"I	don't	think</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	can	get	her	away	to-morrow,	Lionel.	She's	nowhere	to	go	to.	After	all,	she	gave</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	a	delightful	party	to	come	here	and	help	us	out." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Very	well,"	he	said	hastily.	"Perhaps	I	ought	not	to	have	suggested	anything	so inhospitable"—he	tried	to	smile.	"But	I	will	ask	you	to	do	me	 <i class="calibre4">one</i>	favour?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,"	she	said,	still	speaking	coldly.	"What	is	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 want	 you	 to	 ask	 Miss	 Brabazon	 and	 her	 aunt	 to	 keep	 what	 happened	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>afternoon	absolutely	to	themselves." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	course	I	will!"	She	was	relieved.	"I	don't	think	either	of	them	is	in	the	least likely	to	be	even	tempted	to	speak	of	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	XIII</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 even	 while	 Varick	 and	 Blanche	 Farrow	 were	 arranging	 together	 that	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1">disturbing	and	mysterious	occurrence	should	remain	secret,	Helen	Brabazon	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">actually	 engaged	 in	 telling	 one	 who	 was	 still	 a	 stranger	 to	 her	 the	 story	 of	 her amazing	experience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps	 this	 was	 owing	 to	 the	 fact	 that	 the	 door	 of	 the	 hall	 had	 scarcely	 shut behind	her	when	she	met	Sir	Lyon	Dilsford	face	to	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Almost	involuntarily	he	exclaimed,	with	a	good	deal	of	real	concern	in	his	voice:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	anything	the	matter?	I	hope	you	haven't	had	bad	news?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 said,	 "Oh,	 no,"	 and	 shook	 her	 head;	 but	 the	 tears	 welled	 up	 again	 into	 her eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	an	attractive	girl	who	generally	shows	remarkable	powers	of	quietude	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">self-control	breaks	down,	and	proves	herself	a	very	woman	after	all,	the	average</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	 is	 generally	 touched,	 and	 more	 than	 a	 little	 moved.	 Sir	 Lyon	 felt	 oddly affected	by	Helen's	evident	distress,	and	an	ardent	desire	to	console	and	to	help</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	rose	instinctively	in	his	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come	 into	 the	 study!"	 he	 exclaimed	 in	 a	 low	 voice.	 "And	 tell	 me	 if	 there's anything	I	can	do	to	help	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	obeyed	him,	and,	as	he	followed	her	in,	he	shut	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sat	down,	and	for	a	while	he	stood	before	her,	gazing	sympathetically	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	flushed,	tear-stained	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	 afraid	 you'll	 think	 it	 so	 absurd,"	 she	 said	 falteringly.	 "Even	 I	 can	 hardly believe	now	that	what	happened	 <i class="calibre4">did</i>	happen!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	 tell	 me—if	 you'd	 rather	 not,"	 he	 said	 suddenly;	 a	 very	 disagreeable suspicion	entering	his	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Was	it	within	the	bounds	of	possibility	that	James	Tapster	had	tried	to—to	kiss</p>
<p class="calibre1">her?	Sir	Lyon	had	a	great	prejudice	against	the	poor	millionaire,	but	he	instantly</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a>rejected	 the	 idea.	 If	 such	 a	 thing	 had	 indeed	 happened	 to	 her,	 Helen	 Brabazon was	the	last	girl	ever	to	offer	to	tell	anyone,	least	of	all	a	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	all	at	once	felt	that	it	would	be	a	comfort	to	confide	her	strange,	terrifying</p>
<p class="calibre1">experience	to	this	kind	new	friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'd	rather	tell	you,	I	think." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 waited	 a	 moment,	 and	 then	 came	 out	 with	 a	 bald	 statement	 of	 what	 had happened.	"I	was	sitting	knitting,	when	something	seemed	to	force	me	to	look	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">—and	I	saw,	or	I	thought	I	saw,	the	spirit	of	a	dear,	dead	friend." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Lyon	uttered	an	exclamation	of	extreme	astonishment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	 I	 know	 it	 was	 only	 my	 imagination,"	 Helen	 went	 on	 in	 a	 low,	 troubled voice.	"But	it	gave	me	a	most	fearful	shock,	and	I	feel	that,	however	long	I	live,	I shall	never	forget	it!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 wish	 you	 would	 tell	 me	 a	 little	 more	 about	 it,"	 he	 said	 persuasively.	 "I	 don't ask	 out	 of	 idle	 curiosity.	 I	 was	 very	 much	 impressed	 by	 what	 happened	 on	 the first	night	of	our	visit	here—I	mean	at	the	séance." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So	 was	 I,"	 she	 said	 reluctantly.	 "But,	 of	 course,	 this	 had	 nothing	 to	 do	 with—</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	anything	of	that	sort.	In	fact,	Bubbles	(as	she	has	asked	me	to	call	her)	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">sitting,	asleep,	I	think,	in	that	curious	old	carved	confessional	box.	My	aunt	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Varick	were	reading—Mr.	Varick	had	just	come	up	from	the	village	with	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">morning's	 London	 papers;	 Miss	 Farrow	 was	 doing	 her	 embroidery,	 and	 I'd	 just been	counting	some	stitches	in	my	knitting,	when	I	looked	up	and	saw—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stopped,	as	if	not	able	to	go	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Was	 what	 you	 saw,	 what	 you	 took	 to	 be	 an	 apparition,	 close	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">confessional?"	asked	Sir	Lyon	abruptly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	not	so	very	close—still,	not	very	far	away.	It—she—seemed	to	be	standing</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind	Mr.	Varick,	a	little	to	his	left,	on	the	door	side." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	suppose	you	would	rather	not	tell	me	who	it	was	you	saw?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Lyon	thought	he	knew,	but	he	wished	to	feel	sure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	see	why	I	shouldn't	tell	you,"	yet	she	hesitated.	"It	was	poor	Milly,	Sir Lyon—I	 mean	 Mrs.	 Lionel	 Varick.	 She	 and	 I	 became	 great	 friends	 during	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a>weeks	preceding	her	death.	She	even	told	me	that,	apart	from	her	husband,	she had	never	cared	for	anyone	as	she	grew	to	care	for	me.	And	yet—oh,	Sir	Lyon, </p>
<p class="calibre1">what	was	so	very,	very	terrible	just	now,	was	that	I	felt	her	looking	at	me	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">kind	 of	 hatred	 in	 her	 dead	 face,"	 and,	 as	 she	 uttered	 these	 last	 words,	 an expression	of	deep	pain	came	over	Helen	Brabazon's	countenance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	 Lyon	 then	 asked	 a	 rather	 curious	 question:	 "How	 was	 the	 apparition clothed?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In	 her	 shroud.	 A	 woman	 in	 Redsands	 made	 it.	 I	 saw	 the	 woman	 about	 it—</p>
<p class="calibre1">perhaps	 that	 impressed	 it	 on	 my	 mind,"	 her	 mouth	 quivered.	 "The	 figure standing	there	was	exactly	like	Milly	dead,	excepting	that	her	eyes	seemed	alive, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	that	there	was	that	dreadful	look	of	anger	on	her	face." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	long	did	the	vision	last?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	 not	 a	 whole	 minute	 altogether!	 When	 I	 first	 saw	 it	 I	 got	 up,	 and	 without knowing	what	I	was	doing,	I	screamed;	and	then	she,	Milly,	seemed	to	fade	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">—to	melt	into	the	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did	anyone	else	see	anything?"	asked	Sir	Lyon	eagerly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	 I	 don't	 think	 so.	 In	 fact,	 I'm	 quite	 sure	 not.	 My	 aunt	 was	 sitting	 with	 her back	to	Mr.	Varick." </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	pause.	And	then	Helen	asked:	"You	don't	believe	that	the	dead	 <i class="calibre4">can</i> appear	to	the	living—do	you,	Sir	Lyon?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've	 never	 been	 able	 quite	 to	 make	 up	 my	 mind,"	 he	 said	 slowly.	 "But	 I	 do believe,	 absolutely,	 in	 what	 is	 now	 called	 materialization.	 I	 must	 believe	 in	 it, because	I've	witnessed	the	phenomena	a	number	of	times	myself.	But,	of	course, </p>
<p class="calibre1">always	under	a	most	carefully	prepared	set	of	conditions.	I	wish	you'd	tell	me," </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 went	 on,	 "exactly	 how	 the	 figure	 struck	 you?	 Can	 you	 describe	 to	 me	 in greater	detail	the	appearance	of	what	seemed	to	be	the	spirit	of	your	friend?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	did	not	quite	understand	what	he	meant,	but	she	answered	obediently:	"It's</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	difficult	to	describe	more	exactly	what	I	did	see.	As	I	told	you	just	now,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes	 alone	 seemed	 to	 be	 really	 alive	 in	 the	 pale,	 waxen-looking	 face,	 and	 I thought	the	mouth	quivered." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	know,"	he	interjected	quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>"But	the	rest	of	her	poor,	thin,	emaciated	looking	body	seemed	to	be	so	stiff	and still,	 swathed	 in	 the	 long,	 white	 grave-clothes—and	 I	 can't	 express	 to	 you	 the sort	of	growing	horror	of	it	all!	I	 <i class="calibre4">knew</i>	it	was	only	a	few	moments,	yet	it	 <i class="calibre4">seemed</i> like	hours	of	time.	I	felt	as	if	I	 <i class="calibre4">must</i>	call	out	and	indeed	I	did.	But	before	I	could go	 on	 to	 utter	 her	 name,	 Miss	 Farrow	 spoke	 to	 me,	 my	 aunt	 got	 up	 from	 her chair,	 and	 Mr.	 Varick	 rushed	 forward!	 Of	 course	 it	 all	 happened	 in	 much	 less time	than	it	takes	to	tell." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	at	him	earnestly.	What	a	kind,	dependable	face	he	had! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Have	you,	Sir	Lyon,	any	explanation	to	suggest?"	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	suppose,"	he	said	slowly,	"that	you	would	accept	my	explanation,	Miss Brabazon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 think	 I	 would,"	 she	 said	 simply.	 "After	 what	 happened	 that	 first	 night	 I	 feel that	anything	is	possible.	I	am	 <i class="calibre4">sure</i>	my	dear	father's	spirit	was	there." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	am	inclined	to	think	so	too.	But	as	to	this	instance	I	am	not	so	sure	that	what you	saw	was	your	dead	friend.	Unless—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Unless?"	repeated	Helen	questioningly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	 told	 me	 that	 during	 her	 lifetime	 you	 were	 on	 the	 best	 terms	 of	 friendship with	 this	 poor	 lady,	 and	 yet	 that	 on	 her	 dead	 face	 there	 was	 a	 look	 of	 hatred? </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	do	you	account	for	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	questioningly,	penetratingly,	into	the	girl's	distressed	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	 Lyon	 had	 always	 prided	 himself	 on	 his	 self-command	 and	 perfect	 self-</p>
<p class="calibre1">control,	and	yet	he	would	have	given	almost	anything	for	a	really	honest	answer</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	this	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	poor	Helen	did	give	him	an	honest	answer—honest,	that	is,	from	her	own</p>
<p class="calibre1">simple-hearted	point	of	view.	"I	can't	account	for	it!"	she	exclaimed.	"But	I	am sure	it	was	there.	I	felt	the	hatred	coming	out	from	her	towards	me.	And	oh,	Sir</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lyon,	it	was	horrible!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Try	and	think	it	was	not	Mrs.	Varick's	spirit,"	he	said	impressively.	"Try	and	tell yourself	that	it	was	either	a	dream,	a	waking	phantom	of	your	brain,	or—or—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Or	what?"	asked	Helen	eagerly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>But	there	are	thoughts,	questions,	suspicions	that	no	human	being	willingly	puts into	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During	the	last	few	days	Sir	Lyon	had	become	convinced	that	Lionel	Varick	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">resolved	in	his	powerful,	unscrupulous	mind	to	make	Helen	Brabazon	his	wife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	in	vain	that	he	argued	with	himself	that	the	question	of	Miss	Brabazon's</p>
<p class="calibre1">future	 concerned	 him	 not	 at	 all.	 He	 found	 himself	 again	 and	 again,	 when</p>
<p class="calibre1">watching	those	two,	giving	a	great	deal	of	uneasy	thought	to	the	matter.	Now	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">again	 he	 would	 remind	 himself	 that	 Varick	 had	 been	 no	 greater	 an	 adventurer than	 many	 a	 man	 who,	 when	 utterly	 impecunious,	 has	 married	 an	 heiress	 amid the	 hearty	 approval	 and	 acclamation	 of	 most	 of	 the	 people	 about	 them.	 And</p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	could	not	now	be	regarded	as	impecunious;	he	was	a	man	of	substance, </p>
<p class="calibre1">though	no	doubt	even	his	present	income	would	seem	as	nothing	compared	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Brabazon	fortune. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	 Lyon	 was	 ashamed	 of	 his	 growing	 distaste,	 even	 dislike,	 of	 his	 courteous host.	It	was	as	if	in	the	last	few	days	a	pit	had	been	dug	between	them.	It	was	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleasant	to	him	to	be	accepting	the	hospitality	of	a	man	whom	he	was	growing	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">dislike	 and	 suspect	 more	 and	 more	 every	 day.	 And	 yet	 though	 he	 could	 have made	a	hundred	excuses	to	leave	Wyndfell	Hall,	he	stayed	on,	refusing	to	inquire</p>
<p class="calibre1">too	closely	into	the	reason. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 times	 he	 tried	 to	 persuade	 himself	 that	 he	 was	 keenly	 interested	 in	 the problem	 presented	 by	 Bubbles	 Dunster.	 The	 girl	 was	 beyond	 question	 a	 most</p>
<p class="calibre1">rare	and	exceptional	medium.	At	one	time	he	had	made	a	close	study	of	psychic</p>
<p class="calibre1">phenomena;	and	though	he	had	come	to	certain	conclusions	which	had	led	to	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">entirely	 giving	 up	 the	 practices	 which	 had	 once	 seemed	 to	 him	 the	 only	 thing worth	 living	 for,	 he	 was	 still	 sufficiently	 interested	 in	 the	 subject	 to	 feel	 that Bubbles'	powers	were	well	worth	watching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	 Lyon	 would	 have	 given	 much	 to	 have	 been	 present	 at	 what,	 if	 Helen's</p>
<p class="calibre1">account	 were	 correct,	 had	 been	 an	 extraordinary	 example	 of	 what	 is	 called</p>
<p class="calibre1">materialization. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had	 this	 terrible	 vision	 of	 Mrs.	 Varick	 been	 an	 emanation	 of	 Helen	 Brabazon's own	brain—some	subconscious	knowledge	that	she,	Helen,	was	now	the	object</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	Varick's	pursuit?	Or	was	this	woman,	whom	they	all	called	"poor	Milly,"	an unquiet	spirit,	wandering	about	full	of	jealous,	cruel	thoughts,	even	with	regard</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	two	who	had	evidently	been	so	selflessly	devoted	to	her—her	girl	friend</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>and	her	husband? </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then,	suddenly	a	queer	feeling	of	intense	relief	swept	over	him.	Whether	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sentient	being	or	not	had	appeared	to	Helen	Brabazon,	there	could	be	no	doubt</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 what	 had	 just	 happened	 would	 make	 the	 course	 of	 Varick's	 wooing	 more</p>
<p class="calibre1">arduous.	 He	 was	 ashamed	 to	 find	 that	 this	 conviction	 made	 him	 suddenly	 feel oddly	light-hearted—almost,	so	he	told	himself,	a	young	man	again! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	XIV</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 he	 walked	 into	 his	 bedroom,	 which	 was	 pleasantly	 warm—for	 there	 was	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">good	 fire,	 and	 the	 curtains	 across	 the	 three	 windows	 were	 closely	 drawn—Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Panton	told	himself	that	he	was	indeed	beginning	the	New	Year	very	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Half-an-hour	ago	the	whole	party,	with	the	exception	of	Miss	Burnaby,	who	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">gone	to	bed	at	her	usual	time,	had	stood	outside	the	front	door	under	the	starry</p>
<p class="calibre1">sky	while	the	many	clocks	of	Wyndfell	Hall	rang	out	the	twelve	strokes	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	 farewell	 to	 the	 Old	 Year,	 and	 brought	 the	 New	 Year	 in.	 Then	 they	 had	 all crowded	back	again	into	the	hall,	and,	hand	in	hand,	sung	"Auld	Lang	Syne." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	everyone	had	shaken	hands	and	wished	each	other	a	Happy	New	Year,	many</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 sincere	 had	 been	 the	 good	 wishes	 felt	 and	 expressed.	 Even	 James	 Tapster had	looked	genial	and	happy	for	once.	He	was	beginning	to	feel	as	if	he	would, </p>
<p class="calibre1">after	all,	throw	the	handkerchief	to	Bubbles	(his	own	secret,	graceful	paraphrase</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 making	 an	 offer	 of	 marriage).	 But	 as	 yet	 Dr.	 Panton	 knew	 nothing	 of	 this little	under-current	in	the	broad	stream	which	seemed	to	be	flowing	so	pleasantly</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	him.	Had	he	done	so,	he	would	have	been	startled	and	distressed,	for	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	already,	with	a	shrewd	medical	man's	judgment,	"sized	up"	his	fellow	guest, and	found	him	very	much	wanting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus	 not	 knowing	 or	 divining	 anything	 of	 the	 various	 human	 under-currents, </p>
<p class="calibre1">save,	 perhaps,	 that	 he	 guessed	 Donnington	 to	 be	 in	 love	 with	 Bubbles,	 Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Panton	 went	 off	 to	 bed	 in	 a	 very	 cheerful	 and	 contented	 state	 of	 mind.	 So contented	 was	 he	 that	 as,	 with	 leisurely	 fingers,	 he	 lit	 the	 candles	 on	 his dressing-table,	 he	 incidentally	 told	 himself	 that	 Wyndfell	 Hall	 was	 the	 only house	in	which	he	had	ever	stayed	which,	lacking	any	other	luminant	but	lamps</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	candles,	yet	had	amply	enough	of	both! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lighting	a	pipe—for	he	didn't	feel	in	the	least	sleepy—he	drew	forward	a	deep, </p>
<p class="calibre1">comfortable	 armchair	 close	 to	 the	 fire,	 and	 took	 up	 a	 book.	 But	 soon	 he	 put	 it down	again,	and,	staring	at	the	dancing	flames,	his	mind	dwelt	with	retrospective</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleasure	on	the	last	few	hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seated	 between	 Helen	 Brabazon	 and	 Bubbles	 Dunster,	 he	 had	 thoroughly</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a>enjoyed	 the	 delicious	 New	 Year's	 Eve	 dinner	 composed	 by	 Varick's	  <i class="calibre4">chef</i>.	 Miss Brabazon	 had	 admitted	 to	 having	 a	 headache	 this	 evening,	 and	 she	 certainly</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	 very	 far	 from	 well—less	 well	 than	 he	 had	 thought	 her	 to	 be	 when	 they had	first	seen	one	another	again,	after	so	long	an	absence,	this	afternoon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	yet,	as	is	sometimes	the	case,	a	look	of	languor	suited	her;	and	he	thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 had	 grown	 decidedly	 better-looking	 in	 the	 last	 year.	 At	 Redsands	 Miss</p>
<p class="calibre1">Brabazon	 had	 been	 a	 little	 too	 buxom,	 a	 little	 too	 self-possessed,	 also,	 for	 his taste.	 And	 yet—and	 yet	 how	 wonderfully	 good	 she	 had	 been	 to	 poor	 Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick!	 With	 what	 tender	 patience	 had	 she	 put	 up	 with	 the	 invalid's	 querulous bad	temper,	never	even	mentioning	it	to	him,	the	doctor,	who	so	often	received</p>
<p class="calibre1">painful	confidences	of	the	kind	from	those	who	were	far	nearer	and	dearer	to	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">dying	patient	than	Helen	had	been	to	querulous	Milly	Varick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	for	Miss	Bubbles,	he	felt	it	would	be	easy	to	lose	one's	heart	to	that	strange, </p>
<p class="calibre1">queer	 young	 creature.	 They	 had	 made	 real	 friends	 over	 Span.	 And,	 apropos	 of Span,	Dr.	Panton	frowned	to	himself.	He	feared	that	the	dog	was	going	to	be	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	 blot	 on	 this	 delightful	 visit.	 Span	 had	 been	 very,	 very	 badly	 behaved—</p>
<p class="calibre1">setting	up	that	unearthly	howl	whenever	his	master	brought	him	in	contact	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	rest	of	the	party.	Yet	he	was	quite	good	in	the	servants'	hall.	"It	is	clear	that, like	 so	 many	 cleverer	 people	 than	 himself,	 Span	 likes	 low	 company,"	 Bubbles had	whispered	mischievously	to	Span's	master.	"I	daresay	they're	all	very	much</p>
<p class="calibre1">nicer	 than	 we	 are,	 if	 we	 only	 knew	 it!"	 she	 had	 gone	 on,	 but	 Dr.	 Panton	 had shaken	his	head.	He	had	no	great	liking	for	the	modern	domestic	servant.	He	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	of	the	many	people	who	consider	that	the	good	old	type	of	serving-man	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">waiting-woman	 has	 disappeared	 for	 ever.	 To-night,	 remembering	 Bubbles' </p>
<p class="calibre1">words,	he	gave	a	careless,	rueful	thought	to	the	question	of	how	Varick,	who	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">always	 generous	 about	 money,	 must	 be	 cheated—"rooked"	 was	 the	 expression the	 doctor	 used	 in	 his	 own	 mind—by	 these	 job	 servants	 who	 were	 here,	 so	 his host	told	him,	just	for	the	one	month.	Still,	they	were	all	fulfilling	their	part	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 contract	 very	 well,	 especially	 the	  <i class="calibre4">chef</i>!	 Everything	 seemed	 to	 go	 on	 oiled wheels	 at	 Wyndfell	 Hall.	 But	 this	 might	 be	 owing	 to	 clever	 Miss	 Farrow,	 for Varick	had	told	him	that	Miss	Farrow	was	acting	as	hostess	to	the	party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Panton	didn't	much	like	that	composed,	clever-looking	lady.	She	made	him	feel	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	shy,	a	little	 <i class="calibre4">young</i>—a	sensation	he	didn't	very	often	experience	nowadays! </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	treated	him	with	a	courtesy	which,	if	elaborate,	was	also	distant.	It	was	odd</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 think	 that	 Miss	 Farrow	 was	 the	 unconventional,	 friendly	 Bubbles	 Dunster's aunt. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a>Sir	 Lyon	 Dilsford,	 on	 the	 other	 hand,	 he	 liked	 very	 much.	 He	 smiled	 a	 queer little	 smile	 as	 he	 thought	 of	 this	 new	 acquaintance.	 He	 had	 looked	 up	 in	 the middle	 of	 dinner,	 and	 caught	 a	 rather	 curious	 look	 on	 Sir	 Lyon's	 face.	 It	 was	 a thoughtful,	 considering,	 almost	 tender	 look.	 Was	 Sir	 Lyon	 attracted	 to	 Helen Brabazon?	 Well,	 Miss	 Brabazon,	 with	 her	 vast	 wealth,	 and	 Sir	 Lyon,	 with	 his fine	 old	 name,	 and	 agreeable,	 polished	 personality,	 would	 seem	 well	 matched, according	to	a	worldly	point	of	view.	But	Panton	told	himself	that	he	would	 <i class="calibre4">far</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">prefer	Lionel	Varick	were <i class="calibre4">he</i>	a	young	woman.	But	he	feared	there	was	no	hope	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">such	 a	 chance	 coming	 Miss	 Brabazon's	 way.	 Varick's	 heart—his	 big,	 sensitive</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart—was	buried	in	the	grave	of	his	wife.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	strange	to	think	that	"poor	Milly"—for	so	had	even	her	doctor	come	to	call her	in	his	own	mind—had	been	born	and	brought	up	in	this	delightful	old	house! </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 had	 once	 spoken	 to	 him	 of	 her	 unhappy	 girlhood,	 coupling	 it	 with	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">expression	of	gratitude	to	her	husband	for	having	so	changed	her	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Poor	Milly"	was	very	present	to	Dr.	Panton	to-night.	He,	who	had	hardly	given her	a	thought	during	the	last	twelve	months,	found	himself	dwelling	on	her	to	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost	 uncanny	 extent.	 He	 even	 recalled	 some	 unusual	 features	 of	 her	 illness which	 had	 puzzled	 and	 worried	 him	 greatly.	 He	 dismissed	 the	 recollection	 of certain	 of	 her	 symptoms	 with	 an	 effort.	 There	 is	 no	 truer	 saying—at	 any	 rate from	a	doctor's	point	of	view—than	"Let	the	dead	bury	their	dead."	He	had	done his	very	best	for	Mrs.	Varick,	lavished	on	her	everything	that	skill	and	kindness</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 do,	 and	 she	 had	 been	 extraordinarily	 blessed,	 not	 only	 in	 her	 devoted husband,	 but	 in	 that	 sudden,	 unexpected	 friendship	 with	 another	 woman—and</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 such	 a	 good,	 conscientious,	 sweet-tempered	 young	 woman	 as	 was	 Helen</p>
<p class="calibre1">Brabazon.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Half-past	one	struck	on	the	landing	outside	his	room,	and	Dr.	Panton	got	up	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 comfortable	 easy	 chair;	 time	 to	 be	 going	 to	 bed,	 yet	 he	 still	 felt	 quite	 wide awake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 walked	 over	 to	 the	 window	 nearest	 to	 the	 fire-place,	 and	 drew	 back	 the heavy,	 silk-brocaded	 curtain.	 It	 was	 a	 wonderful	 night,	 with	 a	 promise,	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought,	 of	 fine	 weather—though	 one	 of	 the	 men	 who	 had	 stood	 outside	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	had	predicted	snow.	What	a	curious,	eerie	place	this	old	Suffolk	house	was! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Probably	the	landscape	had	scarcely	changed	at	all	in	the	last	five	hundred	years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Below	he	could	see	gleaming	water.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	let	fall	the	curtain,	and,	blowing	out	the	candles,	got	slowly,	luxuriously,	into</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a>the	vast,	comfortable	four-post	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	composed	himself	to	sleep,	broken,	disconnected	images	floated	through</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 brain.	 Bill	 Donnington—what	 a	 nice	 boy!	 And	 yet	 not	 exactly,	 he	 felt,	 in sympathy	with	any	of	the	people	there.	He	wondered	why	Bill	Donnington	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">come	to	spend	Christmas	at	Wyndfell	Hall.	Then	he	remembered—and	smiled	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 fitful	 firelight.	 What	 a	 pity	 there	 wasn't	 some	 nice,	 simple,	 gentle	 girl	 for young	Donnington!	That	was	the	sort	of	girl	he,	Panton,	would	have	chosen	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">him.	 Miss	 Bubbles,	 so	 much	 was	 clear,	 rather	 despised	 the	 poor	 lad.	 She	 had implied	as	much	in	her	clever,	teasing,	funny	way,	more	than	once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 the	 thought	 of	 Bubbles	 unexpectedly	 brought	 up	 another	 image—that	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">James	Tapster.	Of	the	little	party	gathered	together	at	Wyndfell	Hall,	Tapster	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 one	 whom	 the	 doctor	 felt	 he	 really	 didn't	 like.	 He	 couldn't	 imagine	 why Varick	had	asked	that	disagreeable	fellow	here! </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	 the	 men	 were	 still	 in	 the	 dining-room,	 and	 Varick	 had	 gone	 out	 for	 a moment	 to	 look	 for	 some	 very	 special,	 new	 kind	 of	 cigarette	 which	 had	 come down	from	London	a	day	or	two	before,	Tapster	had	spoken	very	disagreeably	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	richness	of	the	French	 <i class="calibre4">chef's</i>	cooking.	He	had	seemed	to	think	it	an	outrage that	 something	 of	 a	 special,	 very	 plain,	 nature	 had	 not	 been	 provided	 for	 him every	day,	and	he	had	hinted	that	perhaps	the	doctor	could	suggest	some	antidote</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	all	this	richness!	There	was	another	reason,	so	Panton's	sleepy	mind	told	him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">why	 he	 didn't	 like	 his	 sulky,	 plain	 fellow-guest.	 It	 became	 suddenly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">unexpectedly,	clear	to	him	that	Tapster	was	much	taken	with	Miss	Bubbles.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	had	hardly	taken	his	eyes	off	her	during	the	whole	of	dinner,	and	it	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	disagreeable,	appraising	look—as	if	he	couldn't	quite	make	up	his	mind	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	was	worth!	He	told	himself,	while	remembering	that	look,	that	Tapster	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	kind	of	man	who	is	always	hesitating,	always	absorbed	in	some	woman,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet	always	afraid	to	try	his	luck—in	the	hope	that	if	he	waits,	he	may	do	better</p>
<p class="calibre1">next	 time!	 Miss	 Bubbles	 was	 a	 hundred	 times	 too	 good	 for	 such	 a	 fellow, </p>
<p class="calibre1">however	rich	the	fellow	might	be.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gradually	 Panton	 felt	 himself	 slipping	 off	 into	 that	 pleasant	 condition	 which immediately	precedes	a	dreamless,	healthful	sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then,	 all	 at	 once,	 his	 senses	 became	 keenly	 alert,	 for	 a	 curious	 sound became	audible	in	the	darkening	room.	It	was	without	doubt	a	sound	created	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	industrious	mouse,	or	perhaps—though	that	idea	was	a	less	pleasant	one—</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	 a	 greedy	 rat.	 Swish,	 swish—swish—just	 like	 the	 rustling	 of	 a	 lady's	 silk</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>dress! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Panton	 stretched	 out	 his	 right	 arm,	 and	 knocked	 the	 wall	 behind	 him	 sharply twice	or	thrice,	and	the	sound	stopped	suddenly.	But	after	a	few	minutes,	just	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	was	dropping	off,	it	began	again.	But	it	no	longer	startled	him,	as	it	had	done</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	first	time,	and	soon	he	was	fast	asleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	might	have	been	a	moment,	it	might	have	been	an	hour,	later,	when	there	came</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	sudden,	urgent	knocking	at	his	door.	He	sat	up	in	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come	in,"	he	called	out,	now	wide	awake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	opened	slowly—and	there	came	through	it	a	curious-looking	figure.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 James	 Tapster,	 arrayed	 in	 a	 wonderful	 dressing-gown	 made	 of	 Persian</p>
<p class="calibre1">shawls,	 and	 edged	 with	 fur.	 He	 held	 a	 candlestick	 in	 his	 hand,	 and	 the	 candle threw	up	a	flickering	light	on	his	pallid,	alarmed-looking	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Dr.	Panton,"	he	whispered,	"I	wish	you'd	come	out	here	a	moment." </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 the	 doctor,	 cursing	 his	 bad	 luck,	 and	 feeling	 what	 he	 very	 seldom	 felt, thoroughly	 angry,	 said	 ungraciously:	 "What	 is	 the	 matter?	 Can't	 you	 tell	 me without	my	getting	out	of	bed?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Last	 night's	 excellent	 dinner,	 which	 couldn't	 have	 hurt	 any	 healthy	 man,	 had evidently	upset	the	unhealthy	millionaire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can't	 you	 hear?"	 whispered	 Tapster.	 His	 teeth	 were,	 chattering;	 he	 certainly looked	very	ill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hear!	Hear	what?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tapster	held	up	his	hand.	And	then,	yes,	the	man	sitting	up	in	the	big	four-post</p>
<p class="calibre1">bed	did	hear	some	very	curious	noises.	It	was	as	if	furniture	was	being	thrown</p>
<p class="calibre1">violently	 about,	 and	 as	 if	 crockery	 was	 being	 smashed—but	 a	 very,	 very	 long way	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	certainly	most	extraordinary!	He	had	done	Tapster	an	injustice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 jumped	 out	 of	 bed.	 "Wait	 a	 minute!"	 he	 exclaimed.	 "I'll	 get	 my	 dressing-gown,	 and	 we'll	 go	 and	 see	 what	 it's	 all	 about.	 What	 extraordinary	 sounds! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where	on	earth	do	they	come	from?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	come	from	the	servants'	quarters,"	said	Tapster. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a>There	came	a	sudden	silence,	and	then	an	awful	crash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	long	have	these	noises	gone	on?"	asked	Panton. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	put	on	his	dressing-gown,	and	was	now	looking	for	his	slippers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	for	a	long	time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tapster's	 hand	 was	 trembling,	 partly	 from	 excitement,	 partly	 from	 fear.	 "How d'you	account	for	it?"	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"One	of	the	servants	has	gone	mad	drunk,"	replied	Panton	briefly.	"That's	what	it is—without	a	doubt!	We'd	better	go	down	and	see	what	can	be	done." </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then,	 as	 there	 came	 the	 distant	 sounds	 of	 breaking	 glass,	 he	 exclaimed:	 "I wonder	everyone	hasn't	woken	up!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There	is	a	heavy	padded	door	between	that	part	of	the	house	and	this.	My	room</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	on	the	other	side,	over	what	they	call	the	school-room.	I	left	the	padded	door</p>
<p class="calibre1">open	just	now	when	I	came	through—in	fact	I	fastened	it	back." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	wasn't	a	very	clever	thing	to	do!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	doctor	did	not	speak	pleasantly,	but	Tapster	took	no	offence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I—I	 wanted	 someone	 to	 hear,"	 he	 said	 humbly;	 "I	 felt	 so	 shut	 off	 through there." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Still,	there's	no	use	in	waking	everybody	else	up,"	said	Panton,	in	a	businesslike tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 didn't	 look	 forward	 to	 the	 job	 which	 he	 thought	 lay	 before	 him;	 but,	 of course,	it	wasn't	the	first	time	he	had	been	called	in	to	help	calm	a	man	who	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">become	violent	under	the	influence	of	drink.	"Go	on,"	he	said	curtly.	"Show	me the	way!	I	suppose	there's	a	back	staircase	by	which	we	can	go	down?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 followed	 his	 guide	 along	 the	 broad	 corridor	 to	 a	 heavy	 green	 baize	 door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stooping,	he	undid	the	hook	which	fastened	the	door	back.	It	swung	to,	and,	as	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">did	so,	there	came	a	sudden,	complete	cessation	of	the	noise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hullo!"	he	said	to	himself,	"that's	odd." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	two	men	waited	for	what	seemed	to	Panton	a	long	time,	but	in	reality	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">less	than	five	minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a>"Would	you	like	to	come	into	my	room	for	a	few	moments?	I	wish	you	would," </p>
<p class="calibre1">said	Mr.	Tapster	plaintively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unwillingly	the	doctor	walked	through	into	what	was	certainly	a	very	pleasant, </p>
<p class="calibre1">indeed	a	luxurious	room.	It	was	furnished	in	a	more	modern	way	than	the	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">rooms	at	Wyndfell	Hall.	"There's	a	bath-room	off	this	room.	That's	why	Varick, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who's	a	good-natured	chap,	gave	it	me.	He	knows	I	have	a	great	fear	of	catching</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	chill,"	whispered	Mr.	Tapster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We'd	better	go	down,"	said	the	doctor	at	last. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"D'you	 think	 so?	 But	 the	 noise	 has	 stopped,	 and,	 after	 all,	 it	 is	 no	 business	 of ours." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Panton	did	not	tell	the	other	what	was	really	in	his	mind.	This	was	that	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	 who	 had	 now	 become	 so	 curiously	 quiet	 might	 unwittingly	 have	 done	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">mischief	to	himself.	All	he	said	was:	"I	have	a	feeling	that	I	ought	to	go	down,	at any	rate." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	words	had	hardly	left	his	lips	before	the	noises	began	again,	and,	of	course, </p>
<p class="calibre1">from	where	the	two	men	were	now,	they	sounded	far	louder	than	they	had	done</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 the	 doctor's	 bed-room.	 Heavy	 furniture	 was	 undoubtedly	 being	 thrown</p>
<p class="calibre1">about,	and	again	there	came	those	curious	crashes,	as	if	plates	and	dishes	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	dashed	against	the	wall	and	broken	there	in	a	thousand	pieces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	say,	this	won't	do!"	Quickly	he	went	towards	the	door,	and	as	he	reached	the corridor	 he	 saw	 the	 swing	 door	 between	 the	 two	 parts	 of	 the	 house	 open,	 and Miss	Farrow	came	through,	looking	her	well-bred,	composed	self,	and	wearing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">incidentally,	a	short,	neat,	becoming	dressing-gown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	can't	think	what's	happening!"	she	exclaimed.	She	looked	from	the	one	man	to the	other.	"What	 <i class="calibre4">can</i>	be	happening	downstairs?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 Panton	 made	 no	 answer,	 Mr.	 Tapster	 replied	 for	 them	 both:	 "The	 doctor thinks	one	of	the	servants	got	drunk	last	night." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	 that	 must	 be	 it,	 of	 course.	 I'll	 go	 down	 and	 see	 who	 it	 is,"	 she	 said composedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Dr.	Panton	broke	in	authoritatively:	"No,	indeed,	Miss	Farrow!	If	it's	what	I think	it	is,	the	fellow	will	probably	be	violent.	You'd	better	let	me	go	down	alone</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	deal	with	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a>There	had	come	again	that	extraordinary,	sudden	stillness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	think	I'd	rather	come	down	with	you,"	she	said	coolly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 three	 started	 going	 down	 the	 narrow,	 steep	 wooden	 staircase	 which</p>
<p class="calibre1">connected	that	portion	of	the	upper	floor	with	the	many	rambling	offices	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">old	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tapster	and	Blanche	Farrow	each	held	a	candle,	but	Dr.	Panton	led	the	way;	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">soon	 they	 were	 treading	 the	 whitewashed	 passages,	 even	 their	 slippered	 feet</p>
<p class="calibre1">making,	in	the	now	absolute	stillness,	what	sounded	like	loud	thuds	on	the	stone</p>
<p class="calibre1">floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Listen!"	said	Blanche	suddenly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	all	stood	still,	and	there	came	a	strange	fluttering	sound.	It	was	as	if	a	bird</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	got	in	through	a	window,	and	was	trying	to	find	a	way	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"D'you	know	the	way	to	the	kitchen?	I	think	that	the	man	must	be	in	the	kitchen, </p>
<p class="calibre1">or	probably	the	pantry,"	whispered	the	doctor	to	his	hostess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	think	it's	this	way." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Farrow	led	them	down	a	short	passage	to	the	right,	and	cautiously	opened	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">door	which	led	into	the	kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then	 they	 all	 three	 uttered	 exclamations	 of	 amazement	 and	 of	 horror. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holding	her	candle	high	in	her	hand,	their	hostess	was	now	lighting	up	a	scene</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	extraordinary	and	of	widespread	disorder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	as	if	a	tornado	had	whirled	through	the	vast,	low-ceilinged	kitchen.	Heavy</p>
<p class="calibre1">tables	 lay	 on	 their	 sides	 and	 upside	 down,	 their	 legs	 in	 the	 air.	 Most	 of	 the crockery—fortunately,	so	Blanche	said	to	herself,	kitchen	crockery—off	the	big</p>
<p class="calibre1">dresser	 lay	 smashed	 in	 large	 and	 small	 pieces	 here,	 there,	 and	 everywhere.	 A large	 copper	 preserving-pan	 lay	 grotesquely	 sprawling	 on	 the	 well-scrubbed</p>
<p class="calibre1">centre	 table,	 which	 was	 the	 one	 thing	 which	 had	 not	 been	 moved—probably</p>
<p class="calibre1">because	of	its	great	weight.	And	yet—and	yet	it	had	been	moved—for	it	was	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">askew!	The	man	who	did	that,	if,	indeed,	one	man	could	alone	have	done	all	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">mischief,	must	have	been	very,	very	strong—a	Hercules! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	doctor	took	the	candle	from	Miss	Farrow's	hand	and	walked	in	among	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">débris.	"He	must	have	gone	through	that	door,"	he	muttered. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>Leaving	 her	 to	 be	 joined	 by	 the	 timorous	 James	 Tapster,	 he	 went	 boldly	 on across	the	big	kitchen,	and	through	a	door	which	gave	into	what	appeared	to	be	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">scullery.	But	here	everything	was	in	perfect	order. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where	can	the	man	have	gone?"	he	asked	himself	in	astonishment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	him	there	rose	a	vision	of	the	respectable	old	butler,	and	of	the	two	tall, </p>
<p class="calibre1">well-matched,	but	not	physically	strong-looking	footmen.	This	must	be	the	work</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	some	man	he	had	not	yet	seen?	Of	course	there	must	be	many	men	employed</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	such	a	place	as	was	Wyndfell	Hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	retraced	his	steps.	"I	think	you	and	Mr.	Tapster	had	better	go	upstairs	again, and	leave	me	to	this,"	he	said	decidedly.	"I'll	have	a	thorough	hunt	through	the place,	 and	 it'll	 probably	 take	 some	 time.	 Perhaps	 the	 man's	 taken	 refuge	 in	 the pantry.	By	the	way,	where	do	the	servants	sleep?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oddly	 enough,	 they're	 none	 of	 them	 sleeping	 in	 the	 house,"	 said	 Blanche quietly.	"They're	down	at	what	are	called	'the	cottages.'	You	may	have	seen	a	row of	 pretty	 little	 buildings	 not	 very	 far	 from	 the	 gate	 giving	 on	 to	 the	 high	 road? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those	cottages	belong	to	Mr.	Varick.	They're	quite	comfortable,	and	we	thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 best	 to	 put	 all	 the	 servants	 together	 there.	 When	 I	 say	 all	 the	 servants"—she corrected	herself	quickly—"the	ladies'	maids	and	Mr.	Tapster's	valet	all	sleep	in the	house.	But	Mr.	Varick	and	I	agreed	that	it	would	be	better	to	put	the	whole	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	temporary	staff	down	together	in	the	cottages." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In	 that	 case	 I	 think	 it's	 very	 probable	 that	 the	 man,	 when	 he	 realized	 the mischief	 he'd	 done,	 bolted	 out	 of	 doors.	 However,	 I	 may	 as	 well	 have	 a	 look round." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	come	with	you,"	said	Blanche	decidedly.	She	turned	to	Mr.	Tapster:	"I	think you'd	better	go	upstairs,	and	try	and	finish	your	night	more	comfortably." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 spoke	 quite	 graciously.	 Blanche	 was	 the	 one	 of	 the	 party	 who	 really</p>
<p class="calibre1">tolerated	Mr.	Tapster—Blanche	and	Mr.	Tapster's	host. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	 right,	 I	 think	 I	 will.	 Though	 I	 feel	 rather	 a	 brute	 at	 leaving	 you	 to	 do	 the dirty	work,"	he	muttered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	set	off	down	the	passage;	and	then,	a	few	moments	later,	he	had	to	call	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	ask	Miss	Farrow	to	show	him	the	way—he	had	lost	himself! </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	took	a	long	time	to	search	through	the	big	commons	of	the	ancient	dwelling. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a>There	 were	 innumerable	 little	 rooms	 now	 converted	 into	 store	 cupboards, larders,	and	so	on.	But	everything	was	in	perfect	order—the	kitchen	alone	being</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	that,	as	yet,	inexplicable	condition	of	wreckage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	at	last	their	barren	quest	was	ended,	and	they	came	up	the	narrow	staircase</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	much	more	cordial	and	kindly	terms	with	one	another	than	either	would	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought	 possible	 some	 hours	 before.	 Then	 the	 doctor,	 with	 an	 "Allow	 me," </p>
<p class="calibre1">pushed	in	front	of	Miss	Farrow	in	order	to	open	wide	the	heavy	padded	door.	"I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wonder	that	you	heard	anything	through	this!"	he	exclaimed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	answered,	"I	was	awakened	by	Mr.	Tapster	talking	to	you.	Then,	of	course,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">heard	those	appalling	noises—for	he	had	left	the	padded	door	open.	I	got	up	and, </p>
<p class="calibre1">opening	 my	 own	 door,	 listened,	 after	 you	 had	 both	 gone	 through.	 When	 there came	that	final	awful	crash	I	felt	I	 <i class="calibre4">must</i>	go	and	see	what	had	happened!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	XV</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">"Spirits?	 What	 absolute	 bosh!	 Miss	 Bubbles	 has	 been	 pulling	 your	 leg,	 Varick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	yet	one	would	like	to	know	who	has	been	at	the	bottom	of	it	all—whether, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	you	say	the	butler	evidently	believes,	it	is	the	 <i class="calibre4">chef</i>	himself,	or,	as	the	 <i class="calibre4">chef</i>	told you,	one	of	the	under-servants.	In	any	case,	I	hope	no	one	will	suppose	that	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">sort	of	thing	can	be	owing	to	a	supernatural	agency." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yet	John	Wesley	did	so	suppose	when	that	sort	of	thing	happened	in	the	Wesley</p>
<p class="calibre1">household,"	came	in	the	quiet	voice	of	Sir	Lyon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 three	 men—Dr.	 Panton,	 Sir	 Lyon,	 and	 Lionel	 Varick—were	 taking	 a	 walk</p>
<p class="calibre1">along	 the	 high	 road.	 It	 was	 only	 eleven	 o'clock,	 but	 it	 seemed	 much	 later	 than that	 to	 two	 of	 them,	 for	 all	 the	 morning	 they	 had	 been	 busy.	 An	 hour	 of	 it	 had been	 taken	 up	 with	 a	 very	 close	 examination	 of	 the	 servants,	 especially	 of	 the respectable	butler	and	of	the	French	 <i class="calibre4">chef</i>.	They	had	both	professed	themselves, together	and	separately,	as	entirely	unable	to	account	for	what	had	happened	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 night.	 But	 still,	 it	 had	 been	 clear	 to	 the	 three	 who	 had	 taken	 part	 in	 the examination—Blanche	Farrow,	Varick,	and	the	doctor—that	the	butler	believed</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	  <i class="calibre4">chef</i>	 to	 be	 responsible.	 "It's	 that	 Frenchman;	 they're	 tricky	 kind	 of	 fellows, ma'am,"	the	man	had	said	in	a	confidential	aside.	And,	though	the	 <i class="calibre4">chef</i>	was	less willing	to	speak,	it	was	equally	clear	that	he,	on	his	side,	put	it	down	to	one	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	under-servants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	quite	at	the	end	of	the	interrogation,	they	had	all	been	startled	by	not	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	  <i class="calibre4">chef</i>,	 but	 the	 butler	 also,	 suddenly	 admitting	 that	 something	 very	 like	 what happened	 last	 night	 had	 happened	 twice	 before!	 But	 on	 the	 former	 occasions, though	 everything	 in	 the	 kitchen	 had	 been	 moved,	 including	 the	 heavy	 centre table,	nothing	had	been	broken.	Still,	it	had	taken	the	 <i class="calibre4">chef</i>	and	his	kitchen-maids two	hours	to	put	everything	right.	That	had	happened,	so	was	now	revealed,	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 very	 morning	 after	 the	 party	 had	 just	 been	 gathered	 together.	 And	 then, again,	four	days	ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	 Burnaby,	 who	 had	 slept	 through	 everything,	 exclaimed,	 when	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">happenings	of	the	night	before	were	told	her	by	Mr.	Tapster,	"The	place	seems</p>
<p class="calibre1">bewitched!	 I	 shall	 never	 forget	 what	 happened	 yesterday	 afternoon	 to	 Helen." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>Turning	to	Dr.	Panton,	she	continued:	"My	niece	actually	believes	that	she	saw	a ghost	yesterday!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	said	sharply,	"I	thought	nothing	was	to	be	said	about	that,	Auntie." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile	 the	 doctor	 stared	 at	 her,	 hardly	 believing	 the	 evidence	 of	 his	 own ears.	"You	thought	you	saw	a	ghost?"	he	said	incredulously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	Helen,	turning	away,	answered:	"I	would	so	much	rather	not	speak	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	don't	want	even	to	think	about	it	ever	again!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	hour	later,	as	Panton	and	Sir	Lyon	stood	outside	the	house	waiting	for	Varick, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	doctor	said	a	word	to	the	other	man:	"A	most	extraordinary	thing	happened</p>
<p class="calibre1">here	yesterday.	Miss	Brabazon	apparently	believes	she	saw	a	ghost." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did	she	tell	you	so	herself?"	asked	Sir	Lyon	quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	 her	 aunt	 mentioned	 it,	 quite	 as	 if	 it	 was	 an	 ordinary	 incident.	 But	 I	 could see	that	it	was	true,	for	she	was	very	much	upset,	and	said	she	would	rather	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">speak	of	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 had	 then	 been	 joined	 by	 their	 host,	 and	 when	 once	 through	 the	 gate,	 the doctor's	 first	 words	 had	 proved	 that	 his	 mind	 was	 still	 full	 of	 all	 that	 had happened	in	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Surely	 <i class="calibre4">you</i>	don't	put	down	what	happened	last	night	to	a	supernatural	agency?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 was	 addressing	 Sir	 Lyon,	 and	 though	 he	 spoke	 quite	 civilly,	 there	 was	 an under-current	of	sarcasm	in	his	pleasant,	confident	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"At	one	time	I	was	very	deeply	interested	in	what	I	think	one	may	call	the	whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">range	 of	 psychic	 phenomena,"	 replied	 Sir	 Lyon	 deliberately,	 "and	 I	 came	 to certain	very	definite	conclusions—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	 what,"	 said	 Varick,	 with	 a	 touch	 of	 real	 eagerness,	 "were	 those conclusions?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Till	now	he	had	not	joined	in	the	discussion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"For	one	thing,	I	very	soon	made	up	my	mind	that	a	great	deal	of	what	occurs	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">every	 properly	 conducted	 séance	 can	 by	 no	 means	 be	 dismissed	 as	 'all	 bosh,'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">answered	Sir	Lyon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	 you	 consider	 that	 the	 séance	 which	 took	 place	 the	 first	 evening	 you	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>here	was	a	properly	conducted	séance?"	asked	Varick	slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes—as	 far	 as	 I	 was	 able	 to	 ascertain—it	 was.	 I	 felt	 convinced,	 for	 instance, that	Laughing	Water	was	a	separate	entity—that	was	why	I	asked	her	to	pass	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">by.	To	me	there	is	something	indecent	about	an	open	séance.	I	have	always	felt</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	very	strongly;	and	what	happened	that	evening	in	the	case	of	Mr.	Burnaby	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">course	confirmed	my	feeling." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	 uttered	 under	 his	 breath	 an	 exclamation	 of	 incredulous	 amazement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"D'you	mean	that	you	believe	there	was	a	 <i class="calibre4">spirit</i>	present?	It	would	take	some	time to	 do	 it,	 but	 I	 think	 I	 could	  <i class="calibre4">prove</i>	 that	 it	 was	 what	 I	 took	 it	 to	 be—thought-reading	of	quite	an	exceptional	quality,	joined	to	a	clever	piece	of	acting." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You'd	find	it	more	difficult	than	you	think	to	prove	that,"	said	Sir	Lyon	quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've	been	to	too	many	séances	to	be	able	to	accept	that	point	of	view.	I	feel	sure that	 Miss	 Bubbles	 was	 what	 they	 call	 'controlled'	 by	 a	 separate	 entity	 calling herself	 'Laughing	 Water.'	 But	 if	 you	 ask	 me	 what	 sort	 of	 entity,	 then	 I	 cannot reply." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Panton	 turned	 on	 him:	 "Then	 you're	 a	 spiritualist?"	 he	 exclaimed.	 "Of	 course	 I was	quite	unaware	of	that	fact	when	I	spoke	just	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	an	underlying	touch	of	scorn	in	his	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	I	do	not	call	myself	a	spiritualist.	But	still—yes,	I	accept	the	term,	if	by	it you	 mean	 that	 I	 believe	 there	 is	 no	 natural	 explanation	 for	 certain	 of	 the phenomena	we	have	seen,	or	heard	of,	in	the	last	twenty-four	hours." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	purposely	did	not	allude	to	what	had	happened	between	tea	and	dinner	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hall	last	evening,	but	he	felt	certain	that	it	was	very	present	to	Varick	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 spoke	 just	 now	 of	 the	 curious	 occurrences	 in	 the	 Wesley	 household,"	 he observed,	turning	to	the	young	doctor.	"That,	of	course,	is	the	most	famous	case</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	record	of	the	sort	of	thing	which	took	place	in	the	kitchen	last	night." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	why,"	cried	Varick,	with	a	touch	of	excitement,	"why	should	all	these	things happen	 just	 now	 at	 Wyndfell	 Hall?	 I	 know,	 of	 course,	 the	 story	 of	 the	 haunted room.	But	most	old	houses	have	one	respectable	ghost	attached	to	them.	I	don't</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind	the	ghost	Pegler	fancies	she	saw—but,	good	heavens,	the	place	now	seems</p>
<p class="calibre1">full	of	tricksy	spirits!	Still,	it's	an	odd	fact	that	none	of	the	servants,	with	the	one exception	of	Miss	Farrow's	maid,	have	seen	anything	out	of	the	way." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a>Here	 the	 doctor	 broke	 in:	 "That's	 easily	 accounted	 for!"	 he	 exclaimed.	 "I understand	from	Miss	Farrow	that	her	maid—a	remarkable	person	without	doubt</p>
<p class="calibre1">—has	held	her	tongue	ever	since	she	saw,	or	thought	she	saw,	a	ghost.	But	if	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">other	servants	knew	everything	we	know,	there'd	be	no	holding	them—there'd	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	servants!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	course,	I	admit	that	in	the	great	majority	of	instances	those	who	think	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	what's	commonly	called	a	ghost	probably	see	no	ghost	at	all,"	said	Sir	Lyon</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughtfully.	"They've	heard	that	a	ghost	is	there,	and	therefore	they	 <i class="calibre4">think</i>	 they see	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then,"	said	Varick,	turning	on	him,	"you	don't	believe	Pegler	did	see	the	ghost of	Dame	Grizel	Fauncey?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Lyon	smiled.	"I	daresay	you'll	think	me	very	illogical,	but	in	this	one	case	I think	 Pegler	  <i class="calibre4">did</i>	 see	 what	 is	 commonly	 called	 a	 ghost.	 And	 I'll	 tell	 you	 why	 I think	so." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both	 men	 turned	 and	 looked	 at	 him	 fixedly,	 both	 in	 their	 several	 ways	 being much	surprised	by	his	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 have	 discovered,"	 said	 Sir	 Lyon	 in	 a	 rather	 singular	 tone,	 "that	 this	 woman Pegler	saw	nothing	for	the	first	few	days	she	occupied	the	haunted	room." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Panton	 stared	 at	 the	 speaker	 with	 an	 astonished	 expression.	 "What	 exactly	 do you	mean	to	imply?"	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Lyon	hesitated.	He	was,	in	some	of	his	ways,	very	old-fashioned.	It	was	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleasant	to	him	to	bring	a	lady's	name	into	a	discussion.	And	yet	he	felt	impelled</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	go	on,	for	what	had	happened	in	the	hall	yesterday	afternoon	had	moved	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">interested	him	as	he	had	not	thought	to	be	interested	and	moved	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	woman	saw	nothing,"	he	said,	slowly	and	impressively,	"till	Miss	Dunster arrived	at	Wyndfell	Hall.	I	take	that	to	mean	that	Miss	Dunster	is	a	very	strong</p>
<p class="calibre1">medium." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A	 medium?"	 repeated	 the	 doctor	 scoffingly.	 "Who	 says	 medium	 surely	 says charlatan,	Sir	Lyon—not	to	say	something	worse	than	charlatan!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	 Lyon	 looked	 thoughtfully	 at	 the	 younger	 man.	 "I	 admit	 that	 often	 mediums are	 charlatans—or	 rather,	 they	 begin	 by	 being	 mediums	 pure	 and	 simple,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 end	 by	 being	 mediums	  <i class="calibre4">qua</i>	 charlatans.	 The	 temptations	 which	 lie	 in	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>way	are	terrible,	especially	if,	as	in	the	majority	of	cases,	they	make	a	living	by their—their"—he	 hesitated—"their	 extraordinary,	 as	 yet	 misunderstood,	 and generally	mishandled	gift." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	 you	 mean,"	 asked	 Varick	 gravely,	 "that	 you	 believe	 Bubbles	 possesses	 the power	of	raising	the	dead?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Lyon	did	not	answer	at	once,	but	at	last	he	said	firmly:	"Either	the	dead,	or some	 class	 of	 intermediate	 spirits	 who	 personate	 the	 human	 dead.	 Yes,	 Varick, that	is	exactly	what	I	do	mean." </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 three	 men	 stopped	 in	 their	 now	 slow	 pacing.	 Dr.	 Panton	 felt	 too	 much</p>
<p class="calibre1">surprised	to	speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	 Lyon	 went	 on:	 "I	 think	 that	 Miss	 Bubbles'	 arrival	 at	 Wyndfell	 Hall	 made visible,	and	is	still	making	visible,	much	that	would	otherwise	remain	unseen." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 he	 caught	 the	 look	 of	 incredulous	 amazement	 on	 the	 doctor's	 face,	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">repeated	very	deliberately:	"That	is	my	considered	opinion.	As	I	said	just	now,	I have	had	a	very	considerable	experience	of	psychic	phenomena,	and	I	realized, </p>
<p class="calibre1">during	that	séance	which	was	held	the	first	evening	I	spent	here,	that	this	young</p>
<p class="calibre1">lady	possessed	psychic	gifts	of	a	very	extraordinary	nature.	There	is	no	doubt	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">all,	in	my	mind,	that	were	she	a	professional	medium,	her	fame	would	by	now	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">world-wide." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps	 it	 was	 the	 derisive,	 incredulous	 look	 on	 the	 young	 medical	 man's	 face which	 stung	 him	 into	 adding:	 "If	 I	 understand	 rightly"—he	 turned	 to	 Varick</p>
<p class="calibre1">—"something	 very	 like	 what	 I	 should	 call	 an	 impromptu	 materialization	 took place	in	the	hall	yesterday—is	that	not	so?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 a	 pause.	 Twice	 Varick	 cleared	 his	 throat.	 Who	 had	 broken	 faith	 and told	 Sir	 Lyon	 what	 had	 happened?	 He	 supposed	 it	 to	 have	 been	 Miss	 Burnaby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Though	I	was	present,"	he	said	at	last,	"I,	myself,	saw	absolutely	nothing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I,	too,	have	heard	something	of	it!"	exclaimed	Dr.	Panton,	looking	from	one	of his	 two	 now	 moved,	 embarrassed,	 and	 excited	 companions	 to	 the	 other.	 "And you	were	actually	present	when	it	happened,	Varick?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	other	remained	silent,	he	turned	to	Sir	Lyon.	"What	was	it	exactly	Miss</p>
<p class="calibre1">Brabazon	thought	she	saw?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	 Lyon,	 after	 a	 glance	 at	 Varick's	 pale,	 set	 face,	 was	 sorry	 that	 he	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>mentioned	the	curious,	painful	occurrence;	and,	though	he	was	a	truthful	man,	he now	told	a	deliberate	lie.	"I	don't	know	what	the	apparition	purported	to	be,"	he observed.	And	he	saw,	even	as	he	was	uttering	the	lying	words,	a	look	of	intense</p>
<p class="calibre1">relief	 come	 over	 Varick's	 face.	 "But	 to	 my	 mind	 Miss	 Brabazon	 evidently	 saw the	rare	phenomenon	known	as	a	materialization.	Miss	Bubbles	was	lying	asleep</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	confessional	which	is	almost	exactly	opposite	the	door	through	which	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">enters	the	hall	from	the	house	side,	thus	the	necessary	conditions	were	present." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 wish	  <i class="calibre4">I</i>	 had	 been	 present!"	 exclaimed	 the	 doctor.	 "Either	 I	 should	 have	 seen nothing,	 or,	 if	 I	 had	 seen	 anything,	 I	 should	 have	 managed	 to	 convince	 myself that	what	I	saw	was	flesh	and	blood." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 neither	 of	 his	 two	 companions	 said	 anything	 in	 answer	 to	 that	 observation, Panton	went	on,	speaking	with	more	hesitation,	but	also	with	more	seriousness</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	he	had	yet	shown:	"Do	I	understand	you	to	mean,	Sir	Lyon,	that	you	credit</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	 young	 fellow-guest	 with	 supernatural	 gifts	 denied	 to	 the	 common	 run	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">mortals?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 should	 not	 put	 it	 quite	 that	 way,"	 answered	 Sir	 Lyon.	 "But	 yes,	 I	 suppose	 I must	admit	that	I	do	credit	Miss	Bubbles	with	powers	which	no	one	as	yet	has</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 able	 to	 analyze	 or	 explain—though	 a	 great	 many	 more	 intelligent	 people than	has	ever	been	the	case	before,	are	trying	to	find	a	natural	explanation." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	 that	 is	 so,"	 asked	 the	 doctor,	 "why	 have	 you	 yourself	 given	 up	 such	 an extraordinarily	important	and	valuable	investigation?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Because,"	said	Sir	Lyon,	"I	consider	my	own	personal	investigations	yielded	a definite	result." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	that	result—?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"—was	 that	 what	 I	 prefer	 to	 call	 by	 the	 old	 term	 of	 occultism	 makes	 for	 evil rather	than	for	good.	Also,	I	became	convinced	that	the	practice	of	these	arts	has</p>
<p class="calibre1">been,	so	to	speak,	put	'out	of	bounds'—I	can	think	of	no	better	expression—by</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatever	Power	it	be	that	rules	our	strange	world." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	spoke	earnestly	and	slowly,	choosing	his	words	with	care. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	your	theory	contains	a	true	answer	to	the	investigations	which	are	now	taking place,"	 exclaimed	 the	 doctor,	 "there	 was	 a	 great	 deal	 to	 be	 said	 for	 those mediaeval	folk	who	burnt	sorcerers	and	witches!	I	suppose	you	would	admit	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 were	 right	 in	 their	 belief	 that	 by	 so	 doing	 they	 were	 getting	 rid	 of	 very</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a>dangerous,	as	well	as	unpleasant,	elements	from	out	of	their	midst?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 speaker	 looked	 hard	 at	 Sir	 Lyon.	 Nothing,	 as	 he	 told	 himself,	 with	 some excitement,	had	ever	astonished	him,	or	taken	him	so	aback,	as	was	now	doing</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	conversation	with	an	intelligent,	cultivated	man	who	seemed	to	have	broad</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	sane	views	on	most	things,	but	who	was	evidently	as	mad	as	a	hatter	on	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	subject. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then,	 before	 Sir	 Lyon	 had	 perchance	 made	 up	 his	 mind	 what	 to	 answer</p>
<p class="calibre1">exactly,	 Varick's	 voice	 broke	 in:	 "Yes,"	 he	 observed,	 smiling	 a	 little	 grimly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"that's	the	logical	conclusion	of	your	view,	Dilsford.	You	can't	get	out	of	it!	If	a human	 being	 really	 possesses	 such	 dangerous	 powers,	 the	 sooner	 that	 human</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	is	put	out	of	the	way	the	better." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	 no!	 I	 don't	 agree!"	 Sir	 Lyon	 spoke	 with	 more	 energy	 than	 he	 had	 yet displayed.	"Everything	points	to	the	fact	that	those	unfortunate	people—I	mean</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	witches	and	sorcerers	of	the	Middle	Ages—could	have	been,	and	sometimes</p>
<p class="calibre1">were,	exorcised." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Exorcised?"	repeated	Panton.	He	had	never	heard	the	word	"exorcised"	uttered aloud	before,	though	he	had,	of	course,	come	across	it	in	books.	"Do	you	mean</p>
<p class="calibre1">driving	out	the	devil	by	means	of	a	religious	ceremony?"	he	asked	incredulously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,"	said	Sir	Lyon,	"I	do	exactly	mean	that.	As	you	are	probably	aware,	there is	a	form	of	exorcism	still	in	common	use.	And	if	I	were	our	host	here,	I	should</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	Wyndfell	Hall	exorcised,	preferably	by	a	Roman	Catholic	priest,	as	soon	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Bubbles	is	safely	off	the	premises." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 doctor	 again	 looked	 sharply	 at	 the	 speaker—but	 no,	 Sir	 Lyon	 evidently</p>
<p class="calibre1">meant	 what	 he	 said;	 and	 even	 Varick	 seemed	 to	 be	 taking	 the	 suggestion</p>
<p class="calibre1">seriously;	for	"That's	not	a	bad	idea,"	he	muttered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	three	men	walked	on	in	silence	for	a	few	moments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	 would	 be	 interesting	 to	 know,"	 observed	 Sir	 Lyon	 suddenly,	 "what	 Miss Farrow	 conceives	 to	 be	 the	 truth	 as	 to	 her	 niece's	 peculiar	 gifts.	 I	 fancy,	 from something	she	told	me	the	other	day,	that	she	hasn't	the	slightest	belief	in	psychic</p>
<p class="calibre1">phenomena,	 I	 wonder	 if	 she	 feels	 the	 same	 after	 what	 happened	 yesterday	 and last	night?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 can	 tell	 you	 exactly	 what	 Miss	 Farrow	 thinks,"	 interposed	 Varick.	 "I	 had	 a word	or	two	with	her	about	it	all	this	morning,	after	we'd	examined	the	servants</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a>in	the	white	parlour." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	  <i class="calibre4">does</i>	 she	 think,"	 asked	 Sir	 Lyon.	 He	 had	 always	 been	 interested	 in Blanche	Farrow,	and,	in	a	way,	he	was	fond	of	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	 thinks,"	 said	 Varick,	 a	 little	 hesitatingly,	 "that	 Bubbles,	 in	 addition	 to	 her extraordinary	 thought-reading	 gift,	 has	 inherited	 from	 her	 Indian	 ancestress	 a power	of	collectively	hypnotizing	an	audience—of	making	people	see	things	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	wants	them	to	see.	That's	rather	awkwardly	expressed,	but	it's	the	best	I	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 quite	 understand,"	 broke	 in	 the	 doctor.	 "You	 mean	 the	 sort	 of	 power	 which certain	Indian	fakirs	undoubtedly	possess?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,"	said	Varick.	"And,	as	I	said	just	now	Bubbles	has	got	Indian	blood	in	her veins.	One	of	her	ancestors	actually	did	marry	an	Indian	lady	of	high	degree,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	is	descended	from	one	of	the	children	of	that	marriage." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	think	that	may	account	for	the	potency	of	her	gift,"	said	Sir	Lyon	thoughtfully, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"though,	 of	 course,	 many	 Europeans	 have	 had,	 and	 now	 possess,	 these	 curious powers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	though,	in	a	sense,	spiritualism	is	no	new	thing,	even	those	who	believe	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	admit	that	it	has	never	led	to	anything,"	observed	Varick	musingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Very	 rarely,	 I	 admit;	 but	 still,	 sometimes	 even	 a	 dream	 has	 contained	 a revelation	of	sorts.	Thus	it	is	on	positive	record	that	a	dream	revealed	the	truth	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	what	was	called	the	Murder	of	the	Red	Barn." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can	I	take	it	that	you	do	believe	the	dead	return?"	asked	the	doctor	abruptly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	think,"	said	Sir	Lyon	deliberately,	"that	certain	of	the	dead	desire	ardently	to return—not	 always	 from	 the	 best	 motives.	 As	 to	 whether	 they	 themselves	 are</p>
<p class="calibre1">permitted	to	come	back,	or	whether	they	are	able	to	use	other	entities	to	carry	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	purpose,	I	am	still	in	doubt." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	spoke	he	saw	a	curious	change	come	over	Lionel	Varick's	face.	The	rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">set	smile	with	which	he	had	been	listening	to	the	discussion	gave	way	to	an	odd</p>
<p class="calibre1">expression	of	acute	unease.	But	at	this	particular	moment	it	was	not	Varick	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">whom	Sir	Lyon	was	concerned,	but	with	the	frank,	eager,	pleasant-faced,	young</p>
<p class="calibre1">doctor,	 in	 whose	 estimation,	 as	 he	 realized,	 he	 was	 falling	 further	 and	 further down	with	every	word	he	uttered. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>"To	tell	you	the	honest	truth,"	he	went	on,	"even	in	the	days	when	I	did	little	else than	 attend	 séances	 and	 have	 sittings	 with	 noted	 mediums,	 not	 only	 in	 this country	but	also	on	the	Continent,	I	could	never	quite	make	up	my	mind	whether</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 spirit	 with	 whom	 I	 was	 in	 communication	 was	 really	 the	 being	 he	 or	 she purported	to	be!	There	was	a	time,"	he	spoke	with	some	emotion,	"when	I	would have	given	anything—certainly	most	willingly	twenty	years	of	my	life—to	be	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">absolutely	convinced.	But	there	it	is,"	he	sighed,	and	was	himself	surprised	at	the feeling	of	depression	which	came	over	him.	"Even	the	most	earnest	investigation</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 kind	 resolves	 itself	 always,	 after	 a	 while,	 into	 a	 kind	 of	 will-o'-the-wisp that	leads	no-whither." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	 always,"	 exclaimed	 Panton	 sharply.	 "Last	 year	 I	 had	 a	 patient	 who'd become	 insane	 owing	 to	 what	 I	 suppose	 you	 would	 call	 an	 investigation	 into psychic	phenomena." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a>"And	 yet,"	 said	 Sir	 Lyon	 rather	 sternly,	 "to	 your	 mind,	 Dr.	 Panton,	 a	 pursuit which	 you	 admit	 was	 capable	 of	 leading	 one	 unfortunate	 human	 being	 into</p>
<p class="calibre1">insanity,	is	'all	bosh'!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	course	I	could	only	go	by	what	the	poor	lady's	friends	told	me,"	Panton	said uncomfortably.	"She	was	not	under	my	care	long.	But	I	need	hardly	tell	you,	Sir</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lyon,	that	any	obsession	that	takes	hold	of	a	human	being	may	in	time	lead	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">insanity." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 suppose	 that,	 according	 to	 your	 theory"—it	 was	 now	 Varick	 who	 was speaking,	 speaking	 rather	 lightly,	 twirling	 his	 stick	 about	 as	 he	 spoke—"I suppose,"	 he	 repeated,	 "that,	 according	 to	 your	 theory,	 if	 Bubbles	 Dunster	 left Wyndfell	Hall	to-morrow,	the	spirits	would	cease	from	troubling,	and	we	should</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	at	rest?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	that	doesn't	exactly	follow.	I	once	heard	of	a	case	which	interested	me	very much.	A	house	which	had	never	been	haunted	before—as	far	as	anyone	knew—</p>
<p class="calibre1">became	 so,	 following	 on	 the	 sojourn	 there	 of	 a	 professional	 medium,	 and	 it remained	 haunted	 for	 four	 years.	 Then,	 suddenly,	 all	 the	 psychic	 phenomena</p>
<p class="calibre1">stopped." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	a	strange	thing,"	said	Panton,	with	an	under-current	of	irony	in	his	voice; </p>
<p class="calibre1">"but	doubtless	the	owner	had	had	the	house	exorcised,	as	you	call	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	 said	 Sir	 Lyon	 thoughtfully.	 "No,	 the	 house	 had	 not	 been	 exorcised.	 As	 a matter	of	fact,	the	medium	was	killed	in	a	railway	accident." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 walked	 on,	 and	 fell	 to	 talking	 of	 indifferent	 things.	 But	 though	 Sir	 Lyon had	 at	 one	 time	 held	 many	 such	 conversations	 with	 sceptical	 or	 interested</p>
<p class="calibre1">persons,	this	particular	conversation	will	never	be	forgotten	by	him,	owing	to	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">strange	 occurrence	 which	 happened	 in	 the	 afternoon	 of	 that	 same	 day.	 But	 for two	 fortunate	 facts—the	 bravery	 of	 young	 Donnington,	 and	 the	 presence	 of	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">clever	 medical	 man—the	 pleasant	 comedy	 in	 which	 they	 were	 each	 and	 all</p>
<p class="calibre1">playing	an	attractive	part	would	have	been	transformed	into	a	peculiarly	painful</p>
<p class="calibre1">tragedy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	XVI</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">While	 three	 members	 of	 the	 party	 had	 thus	 been	 walking	 and	 talking,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">principal	 subject	 of	 their	 discussion,	 Bubbles	 Dunster,	 had	 gone	 through	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">exciting	and	unpleasant	experience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 starting	 out	 for	 a	 solitary	 walk	 to	 give	 Span	 a	 run,	 she	 saw,	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">annoyance,	 James	 Tapster	 following	 her,	 and	 to	 her	 acute	 discomfiture	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">managed	to	stammer	out	what	was	tantamount	to	an	offer	of	marriage.	Though, </p>
<p class="calibre1">in	a	sense,	she	had	certainly	tried	to	attract	him,	she	felt,	all	at	once,	miserably</p>
<p class="calibre1">ashamed	 of	 her	 success.	 So	 much	 so,	 indeed,	 that	 she	 pretended	 at	 first	 not	 to understand	what	he	meant.	But	at	last	she	had	to	leave	such	pretence	aside,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">then	 it	 was	 she	 who	 surprised	 Mr.	 Tapster,	 for,	 "You	 must	 let	 me	 have	 time	 to think	over	the	great	honour	you	have	done	me,"	she	said	quietly.	"If	you	want	an answer	now,	it	must	be	 <i class="calibre4">no</i>." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 protested	 sulkily	 that	 of	 course	 he	 would	 give	 her	 as	 much	 time	 as	 she wanted,	and	then	she	observed,	slyly,	"I	am	sure	that	you	yourself	did	not	make</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	your	mind	to	be	married	all	in	a	minute,	Mr.	Tapster.	You	weighed	the	pros</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	cons	very	carefully,	no	doubt.	So	you	must	give	me	time	to	do	so	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles'	measured	words,	the	feeling	that	she	was,	so	to	speak,	keeping	him	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">arm's	length,	took	the	hapless	Tapster	aback,	and	frightened	him	a	little.	He	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt	so	sure	that	once	he	had	made	up	his	own	mind	she	would	eagerly	say	"Yes!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Often,	 during	 the	 last	 few	 days,	 he	 had	 told	 himself,	 with	 a	 kind	 of	 mirthless chuckle,	that	 <i class="calibre4">he</i>	was	not	going	to	be	"caught";	but	when,	at	last,	he	had	made	up his	 mind	 that	 Bubbles	 would	 make	 him,	 if	 not	 an	 ideal,	 then	 a	 very	 suitable, wife,	it	seemed	strange	indeed	that	she	was	not	eager	to	"nail	him."	That	she	was not	exactly	eager	to	do	so	was	apparent,	even	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Calling	 Span	 sharply	 to	 her,	 the	 girl	 turned	 round,	 and	 began	 making	 her	 way towards	 the	 house	 again;	 finally	 she	 disappeared	 with	 Span	 in	 the	 direction	 of the	servants'	quarters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	 Tapster,	 walking	 on	 by	 himself,	 began	 to	 feel	 unaccountably	 frightened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 asked	 himself,	 uneasily,	 almost	 uttering	 the	 words	 aloud	 in	 his	 agitation, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>whether,	after	all,	he	had	been	"caught";	and	whether	Bubbles	was	only	"making all	this	fuss"	in	order	to	"bring	him	to	heel"?	But	two	could	play	at	that	game.	He toyed	 seriously,	 or	 so	 he	 believed,	 with	 the	 idea	 of	 ordering	 his	 motor	 and	 just</p>
<p class="calibre1">"bolting";	 but	 of	 course	 he	 did	 nothing	 of	 the	 kind.	 The	 more	 Bubbles	 hung back,	 the	 more	 he	 wanted	 her;	 her	 coldness	 stung	 him	 into	 something	 nearer ardour	than	he	had	ever	felt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 Bubbles?	 Bubbles	 felt	 annoyed,	 uneasy,	 even	 obscurely	 hurt.	 It	 often</p>
<p class="calibre1">happens	 that	 an	 offer	 of	 marriage	 leaves	 a	 girl	 feeling	 lonely	 and	 oppressed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Deep	in	her	heart	she	knew	she	would	never,	never,  <i class="calibre4">never</i>,	become	Mrs.	Tapster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	other	hand,	she	was	aware	that	there	were	many	people	in	the	London	set</p>
<p class="calibre1">among	whom	she	now	lived	and	had	her	being,	who	would	regard	her	as	mad	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">refuse	 a	 man	 who,	 whatever	 his	 peculiarities,	 possessed	 enormous	 wealth.	 If</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	 she	 could	 have	 had	 a	 tenth	 part	 of	 James	 Tapster's	 money	 without	 James Tapster,	what	a	happy	woman	she	would	have	been! </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	it	was,	Bubbles	told	herself	fretfully	that	she	had	no	wish	to	be	married.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 not	 yet	 tired	 of	 the	 kind	 of	 idle-busy	 life	 she	 led;	 it	 was	 an	 amusing	 and stimulating	life;	and	though	she	had	her	dark	hours,	when	nothing	seemed	worth</p>
<p class="calibre1">while,	up	to	the	present	time	there	had	been	much	more	sunshine	than	shadow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 girl	 was	 sufficiently	 clever	 and	 sensitive	 to	 realize	 her	 good	 fortune	 in	 the matter	 of	 Bill	 Donnington.	 Sometimes,	 deep	 in	 her	 heart,	 she	 told	 herself	 that when	she	had	drunk	her	cup	of	pleasure,	amusement,	and	excitement	to	the	dregs</p>
<p class="calibre1">—perhaps	in	ten	 years	from	now—she	 would	at	last	 reward	Donnington's	long</p>
<p class="calibre1">faithful	 love	 and	 selfless	 devotion.	 And	 rather	 to	 her	 own	 surprise,	 during	 the half-hour	 which	 followed	 Tapster's	 uninspired	 proposal,	 Bubbles	 thought	 far</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	of	Donnington	than	she	did	of	the	man	who	had	just	asked	her	to	become</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	wife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sitting	all	alone	in	the	hall,	crouching	down	on	a	footstool	close	to	the	fire,	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">somehow	she	felt	tired—tired,	and	exhausted—she	made	one	definite	resolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 would	 give	 up,	 as	 far	 as	 she	 was	 able,	 the	 practice	 of	 those	 psychic	 arts which	 she	 knew	 those	 who	 loved	 her	 believed	 to	 involve	 a	 real	 danger	 to	 her general	well-being.	What	had	happened	the	afternoon	before	had	frightened	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 had	 been	 entirely	 unconscious	 of	 the	 awful	 phenomena	 which	 had	 taken</p>
<p class="calibre1">place,	and	she	was	becoming	seriously	alarmed	at	her	own	increasing	power	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">piercing	 the	 veil	 which	 hangs	 between	 the	 seen	 and	 the	 unseen.	 What	 she	 had told	Donnington	during	their	talk	in	the	old	darkened	church	had	been	true:	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">often	felt	herself	companioned	by	entities	who	boded	ill,	if	not	to	herself,	then	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">those	 about	 her.	 Since	 yesterday,	 also,	 there	 had	 hung	 heavily	 over	 her	 mind	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a>premonition	 that	 she,	 personally,	 was	 in	 danger.	 Now	 she	 told	 herself	 that perhaps	 the	 peculiar,	 disturbing	 sensation	 had	 only	 been	 a	 forerunner	 of	 James Tapster's	unexpected	offer	of	marriage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	would	you	say	to	our	all	going	out	for	a	walk?"	Luncheon	was	just	over, and	Varick	was	facing	his	guests.	The	only	one	missing	was	Dr.	Panton,	who	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">gone	up	to	his	room,	saying	he	had	some	work	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	 afraid	 it	 must	 be	 very	 wet	 and	 slushy,"	 said	 Blanche	 Farrow	 dubiously.	 It had	snowed	in	the	night,	and	now	a	thaw	had	set	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had	an	almost	catlike	dislike	of	wet	or	dirt;	on	the	other	hand,	she	was	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	those	people	who	are	generally	willing	to	put	aside	their	own	wishes	in	favour</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	what	those	about	them	wish	to	do;	and	she	saw	that	for	some	reason	or	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lionel	Varick	wanted	this	suggestion	of	his	to	be	carried	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 can	 take	 you	 to	 a	 place,"	 he	 exclaimed,	 "where	 I	 think	 we	 shall	 find	 it	 dry walking	 even	 to-day.	 It's	 a	 kind	 of	 causeway,	 or	 embankment"—he	 turned	 to Helen	Brabazon—"which	some	people	say	was	built	by	the	Romans." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	think	a	walk	would	be	very	nice,"	she	agreed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	did	not	look	like	her	usual	cheerful,	composed	self.	The	experience	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 befallen	 her	 the	 day	 before	 still	 haunted	 her	 mind	 to	 the	 exclusion	 of everything	 else.	 Perhaps	 a	 good	 long	 walk	 would	 make	 her	 feel	 a	 different</p>
<p class="calibre1">creature,	 and	 chase	 that	 awful	 image	 of	 Milly	 Varick	 in	 her	 grave-clothes	 from her	brain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 so	 in	 the	 end	 the	 whole	 party	 started	 off,	 with	 the	 exception	 of	 Miss Burnaby	 and	 Dr.	 Panton.	 Bubbles	 tried	 hard	 to	 get	 out	 of	 going	 on	 what	 she frankly	 said	 seemed	 to	 her	 "a	 stupid	 expedition,"	 but	 Donnington	 had	 a	 theory that	the	open	air	would	do	her	good,	and	as	for	Varick,	he	exclaimed	in	a	good-humoured	 but	 very	 determined	 tone:	 "If	  <i class="calibre4">you</i>	 won't	 come,	 Bubbles,	 I	 give	 the whole	thing	up!"	In	a	lower	voice	he	added:	"Naughty	as	you	are,	you're	the	life and	soul	of	the	party." </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	thus	it	was	to	please	Varick,	rather	than	Donnington,	that	Bubbles	started	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	was	to	be	to	all	those	that	took	part	in	it	a	memorable	walk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poor	 Donnington!	 The	 young	 man	 felt	 alarmed	 and	 perplexed	 concerning</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles'	 general	 condition.	 He	 knew	 something	 that	 had	 shocked	 and	 startled</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>her	had	happened	the	day	before,	but	when	he	had	tried	to	find	out	what	it	was, she	had	snubbed	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	 so	 many	 people	 wiser	 and	 cleverer	 than	 himself,	 Donnington	 found	 it</p>
<p class="calibre1">impossible	to	make	up	his	mind	concerning	psychic	phenomena.	When	kneeling</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	 Bubbles'	 side	 in	 the	 dimly-lit	 church	 he	 had	 accepted,	 almost	 without</p>
<p class="calibre1">question,	her	own	explanation	of	her	strange	and	sinister	gift,	but	by	now	he	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">argued	 himself	 out	 of	 the	 belief	 that	 such	 things	 could	 be	 in	 our	 work-a-day world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	someone	else	of	the	party	who	was	also	giving	a	great	deal	of	anxious</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought	 to	 Bubbles'	 uncanny	 powers.	 Blanche	 Farrow,	 like	 Helen	 Brabazon, </p>
<p class="calibre1">could	not	banish	from	her	mind	the	experience	which	had	befallen	her	in	the	hall</p>
<p class="calibre1">last	 evening.	 Every	 time	 she	 looked	 at	 Lionel	 Varick	 there	 rose	 before	 her	 that terrible	vision	of	the	two	unquiet	spirits	who	had	stood,	sentinel-wise,	on	either</p>
<p class="calibre1">side	of	him.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again	 and	 again	 in	 the	 long	 watches	 of	 a	 wakeful	 night,	 Blanche	 had-assured herself	that	what	she	had	seen	was	no	more	real	than	is	a	vivid	dream.	She	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">further	 told	 herself,	 taking	 comfort	 in	 the	 telling,	 that	 the	 power	 possessed	 by Bubbles	 was	 now	 understood,	 and	 accounted	 for,	 by	 those	 learned	 men	 who</p>
<p class="calibre1">make	a	scientific	study	of	hypnotism.	Yet,	try	as	she	would,	she	could	not	banish</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	her	mind	and	from	her	memory	the	unnerving	experience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 were	 crossing	 the	 moat	 bridge	 when	 there	 came	 a	 shout	 from	 the	 house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 all	 stopped,	 to	 be	 joined,	 a	 minute	 later,	 by	 Dr.	 Panton.	 "It's	 an extraordinary	thing,"	he	exclaimed,	"I	fully	intended	to	give	up	this	afternoon	to writing,	but	somehow	I	suddenly	felt	as	if	I	 <i class="calibre4">must</i>	look	out	of	the	window!	You	all looked	so	merry	and	bright	that	I	have	thrown	my	work	to	the	winds,	and	here	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">am,	coming	with	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	was	rather	counting	on	you	to	keep	Miss	Burnaby	company." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick's	tone	was	not	very	pleasant,	and	Panton	for	a	moment	regretted	he	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">come;	 but	 as	 he	 had	 passed	 through	 the	 hall	 he	 had	 seen	 the	 old	 lady	 nodding over	 a	 book,	 and	 he	 was	 well	 aware	 that	 had	 he	 stayed	 indoors,	 it	 would	 have been	to	work	up	in	his	own	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bill	 Donnington	 suddenly	 discovered	 that	 Bubbles	 was	 wearing	 absurd,	 high-</p>
<p class="calibre1">heeled,	London	walking	shoes.	"Go	back	and	put	on	something	more	sensible," </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	said	shortly;	"I'll	wait	for	you—we'll	soon	pick	up	the	others." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a>But	Bubbles	answered	sullenly:	"My	heavy	walking	boots	got	wet	this	morning." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	as	she	spoke,	she	stood	irresolute.	Why	not	make	her	unsuitable	foot-gear</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	excuse	for	staying	at	home?	She	told	herself	discontentedly	that	she	hated	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought	of	this	walk.	But	Donnington	would	have	none	of	it.	"Never	mind,"	he said	firmly,	"you	can	change	your	shoes	and	stockings	the	minute	you	come	in." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	submitted	with	an	ill	grace,	and	after	the	whole	party	were	clear	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">islet	on	which	stood	Wyndfell	Hall,	she	refused	pettishly	to	walk	anywhere	near</p>
<p class="calibre1">him.	She	hung	behind,	even	rejecting	the	company	of	James	Tapster,	to	whom, </p>
<p class="calibre1">however,	 she	 was	 for	 the	 most	 part	 fitfully	 gracious;	 and	 when,	 at	 length,	 the whole	party	were	sorting	themselves	into	couples,	she	found	herself	walking	last</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	Varick,	the	others	being	all	in	front	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	was	disagreeably	conscious	that	with	his	present	companion	his	charm	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">manner—that	something	which	drew	to	him	all	women	and	most	men—availed</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	 not	 at	 all.	 Still,	 to-day,	 he	 was	 determined	 to	 get	 on	 good	 terms	 with Bubbles.	So	well	did	he	succeed	that	at	last	something	impelled	her	to	say	rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">penitently:	 "I	 want	 to	 tell	 you	 that	 what	 happened	 yesterday	 afternoon	 was	 not my	fault,	and	that	I'm	very	sorry	it	happened,	Lionel." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Donnington,	who	was	just	in	front,	heard	Varick	answer,	lightly:	"You	can	hardly</p>
<p class="calibre1">expect	me	to	believe	that,	Bubbles!	But	I	would	give	a	good	deal	to	know	how</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	do	it?"	As	she	made	no	answer,	he	went	on:	"It's	a	remarkable	thing	to	be able	to	will	people	into	seeing	something	which	is	not	there!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Donnington	 strained	 his	 ears	 to	 hear	 the	 low,	 defiant	 answer:	 "I	 give	 you	 my word	of	honour	that	I	knew	nothing,  <i class="calibre4">nothing</i>,	till	you	came	and	woke	me	up!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	 was	 it	 that	 had	 happened	 yesterday?	 The	 young	 man	 felt	 almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">unbearably	 anxious	 to	 know.	 All	 he	 knew	 was	 that	 it	 had	 greatly	 affected, </p>
<p class="calibre1">surprised,	and	disturbed	those	who	had	been	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly	 Varick's	 tones	 floated	 again	 towards	 the	 listener:	 "I'll	 take	 your	 word for	 it,	 my	 dear	 girl.	 After	 all,	 it's	 all	 in	 the	 picture.	 What	 with	 our	 ghosts,	 our practical	jokes,	and	so	on,	we're	having	a	regular	old-fashioned	Christmas!	Still, </p>
<p class="calibre1">when	I	heard	Miss	Brabazon	give	that	dreadful	cry,	I	did	feel	that	one	could	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">too	much	of	a	good	thing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	Donnington	detected	the	false	 <i class="calibre4">bonhomie</i>	in	Varick's	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	laughed	back,	not	very	pleasantly.	"I	did	you	a	good	turn	when	I	got	rid</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a>of	Mr.	Burnaby.	I	thoroughly	scared	him!	Your	nice	young	doctor's	a	very	good exchange	for	that	disagreeable	old	man." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	and	Panton's	a	very	clever	fellow,	as	well	as	one	of	the	best,"	said	Varick heartily.	"I	am	glad	he	managed	to	get	out	this	afternoon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	thought	you	didn't	want	him	to	come,"	said	Bubbles	sharply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	knew	he	had	some	important	work	to	finish." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	felt	annoyed.	Somehow	Bubbles	always	seemed	to	be	convicting	him	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">insincerity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 were	 now	 close	 to	 the	 embankment,	 of	 which	 their	 host	 had	 drawn	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">attractive	 picture.	 But	 Blanche	 looked	 up	 at	 it	 with	 some	 dismay.	 The	 scene under	the	wintry	sky	looked	wild	and	singularly	dreary.	Many	of	the	fields	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">under	 water,	 and	 stretches	 of	 the	 marshy	 land	 were	 still	 covered	 with	 wide streaks	of	snow.	Across	the	now	sullen-looking,	cloudy	sky	there	moved	a	long</p>
<p class="calibre1">processional	flight	of	cawing	rooks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 whole	 party	 closed	 up	 for	 a	 few	 moments.	 Then	 they	 walked	 up	 the	 steps which	led	to	the	high	causeway	along	which	Varick	had	promised	his	friends	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">dry	 walk.	 Sure	 enough,	 once	 they	 had	 reached	 the	 top,	 they	 found	 that	 the melting	 snow	 had	 already	 drained	 off	 the	 narrow	 brick	 path.	 Even	 so,	 it	 was slippery	walking,	and	for	her	part	Blanche	Farrow	felt	sorry	that	they	had	left	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">muddy	road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 party	 soon	 separated	 into	 couples	 again,	 Miss	 Farrow	 and	 Dr.	 Panton</p>
<p class="calibre1">leading,	 while	 Bubbles	 and	 Varick	 came	 last,	 behind	 all	 the	 others.	 "We	 must look	just	like	the	animals	going	into	the	ark,"	said	the	girl	disagreeably. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whatever	the	others	might	be	feeling,	Dr.	Panton	was	thoroughly	enjoying	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">muddy	 walk.	 He	 found	 it	 singularly	 pleasant	 to	 be	 with	 agreeable,	 well-bred people,	 who	 were	 all	 so	 fit	 that	 not	 one	 of	 them,	 with	 the	 exception	 of	 James Tapster,	 had	 even	 asked	 him	 a	 question	 bearing	 on	 health—or	 the	 lack	 of	 it.	 It had	 been	 pleasant,	 too,	 to	 meet	 Miss	 Brabazon	 again,	 for	 they	 had	 become</p>
<p class="calibre1">friends,	rather	than	acquaintances,	over	poor	Mrs.	Varick's	deathbed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind	Dr.	Panton	and	Miss	Farrow—for	the	brick	path	which	formed	the	crest</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 embankment	 only	 held	 two	 walkers	 comfortably—were	 the	 least	 well-</p>
<p class="calibre1">assorted	 couple	 of	 the	 party,	 Bill	 Donnington	 and	 James	 Tapster.	 They	 just</p>
<p class="calibre1">plodded	 along	 side	 by	 side,	 now	 and	 again	 exchanging	 a	 laconic	 word	 or	 two. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>Tapster's	 half-formed	 hope	 had	 been	 that	 he	 would	 walk	 with	 Bubbles	 this afternoon;	 but,	 when	 it	 came	 to	 the	 point,	 he	 had	 made	 no	 real	 effort	 to	 secure her	company. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 unfortunate	 man	 was	 feeling	 very	 nervous	 and	 uneasy—afraid	 lest	 he	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	too	precipitate	in	his	wooing,	for	Bubbles	frightened	as	well	as	fascinated</p>
<p class="calibre1">him.	Even	he	half	realized	that,	as	her	husband,	he	would	be	tolerated	rather	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">welcomed	in	a	world	of	which	he	was	anxious	to	form	part,	though	in	his	heart</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	at	once	despised	and	feared	its	denizens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	times	he	was	even	tempted	to	wish	that	she	had	said	"No"	at	once—and	that although	he	knew	that	he	would	have	been	very	surprised	and	disappointed	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	done	so.	On	the	whole	he	thought	that	after	a	period	of	maidenly	hesitation</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	would	say	"Yes";	and,	having	inherited	from	an	acquisitive	father	a	positive, concrete	 kind	 of	 mind,	 as	 he	 trudged	 along	 he	 began	 ruminating	 over	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">question	 of	 Bubbles'	 marriage	 settlements.	 On	 one	 thing	 he	 was	 determined. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing	 should	 induce	 him	 so	 to	 arrange	 matters	 that	 in	 the	 event	 of	 his	 death Bubbles	 should	 be	 able	 to	 dower	 some	 worthless	 fortune-hunter	 with	 his, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tapster's,	wealth!	He	felt	certain	that	her	father's	solicitors	would	try	and	arrange</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	this	might	come	to	pass—"lawyers	are	such	cunning	devils"—and	he	grew</p>
<p class="calibre1">purple	with	rage	at	the	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	surprised	Donnington	would	have	been	could	he	have	looked	into	his	dull</p>
<p class="calibre1">companion's	mind! </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 addition	 to	 Dr.	 Panton,	 two	 other	 people	 were	 really	 enjoying	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1">uncomfortable	walk,	for	Helen	Brabazon	and	Sir	Lyon	Dilsford	had	plenty	to	say</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 one	 another.	 It	 was	 very	 seldom	 that	 Sir	 Lyon	 found	 a	 young	 woman</p>
<p class="calibre1">interested	 in	 the	 subjects	 he	 himself	 had	 most	 at	 heart.	 He	 found	 it	 a	 curiously pleasant	experience	to	answer	her	eager,	ignorant	questions	on	sociological	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">political	 subjects.	 It	 was	 clear	 that	 Miss	 Brabazon	 only	 regarded	 herself	 as	 the trustee	 of	 her	 vast	 wealth,	 and	 this	 touched	 her	 companion	 very	 much.	 Also, what	 had	 happened	 yesterday—that	 sudden,	 intimate	 confession	 of	 what	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">taken	place	in	the	hall—had	made	their	relations	to	one	another	much	closer.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">neither	of	them	had	alluded	to	it	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 for	 Lionel	 Varick	 and	 Bubbles	 Dunster,	 they	 were	 now	 lagging	 some	 way</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind	 the	 others.	 More	 than	 once	 the	 girl	 suggested	 that	 she	 should	 slip	 away and	 go	 back	 to	 Wyndfell	 Hall	 alone,	 but	 her	 host	 would	 not	 hear	 of	 it.	 He declared	 good-humouredly	 that	 soon	 they	 would	 all	 be	 homeward	 bound;	 so, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a>apathetically,	Bubbles	walked	on,	her	feet	and	her	head	aching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	old	Roman	embankment	now	formed	part	of	the	works	connected	with	a	big</p>
<p class="calibre1">reservoir,	 and	 at	 last	 the	 walkers	 reached	 a	 kind	 of	 platform	 from	 whence	 they could	see,	stretching	out	to	their	right,	a	wide,	triangular-shaped	piece	of	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	Farrow	was	for	turning	back;	but	Helen	Brabazon,	Sir	Lyon,	and	Varick</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 all	 for	 going	 on,	 the	 more	 so	 that	 Varick	 declared	 that	 at	 a	 cottage	 which formed	the	apex	of	the	reservoir	they	would	be	able	to	get	some	tea.	So	off	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">started	 again,	 in	 the	 same	 order	 as	 before,	 to	 find,	 however,	 that	 the	 narrow brick-way,	instead	of	being	drier—as	one	would	have	expected	it	to	be	above	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">water—was	more	slushy	and	slippery	than	had	been	the	path	running	along	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">top	of	the	older	part	of	the	embankment.	Yet	the	steep	bank	leading	down	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sullen,	 half-frozen	 surface	 of	 the	 reservoir	 had	 been	 cleared	 of	 the	 grass	 and bushes	which	covered	the	slopes	of	the	rest	of	the	causeway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	had	all	been	walking	on	again	for	some	minutes	when	Donnington	turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">round.	"Take	care,	Bubbles!	It's	very	slippery	just	here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	all	right,"	she	called	back	pettishly.	"Mind	your	own	business,	Bill.	I	wish you	wouldn't	keep	looking	round!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Donnington	saw	Varick	put	out	his	right	hand	and	grasp	the	girl's	arm	firmly;	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">even	so	it	struck	him	that	they	were	both	walking	too	near	the	edge	on	the	side	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	water.	Still,	he	didn't	feel	he	could	say	any	more,	and	so	he	turned	away,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">again	began	trudging	along	by	the	silent	Tapster's	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 a	 while	 nothing	 happened,	 and	 then	 all	 at	 once	 there	 occurred	 something which	 Donnington	 will	 never	 recall—and	 that	 however	 long	 he	 may	 live—</p>
<p class="calibre1">without	a	sensation	of	unreasoning,	retrospective	horror	welling	up	within	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	yet	it	was	only	the	sound—the	almost	stuffless	sound—of	a	splash!	It	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	if	a	lump	of	earth,	becoming	detached	from	the	wet	bank,	had	rolled	over	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	deep	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 the	 same	 moment,	 or	 a	 fraction	 of	 a	 moment	 later,	 Varick	 laughed	 aloud;	 it was	 a	 discordant	 laugh,	 evidently	 at	 something	 Bubbles	 had	 just	 said,	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Donnington	heard	the	words,	"Really,	Bubbles!"	uttered	in	a	loud,	remonstrating, and	yet	jovial	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then,	 all	 at	 once,	 some	 instinct	 caused	 the	 young	 man	 to	 wheel	 sharply round,	to	see,	a	long	way	back	from	the	others,	Varick	standing	solitary	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>brick	path. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	companion	had	vanished.	It	was	as	if	the	earth	had	swallowed	her	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where's	Bubbles?"	shouted	Donnington. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 Varick,	 still	 standing	 in	 the	 middle	 of	 the	 path,	 did	 not	 look	 as	 if	 he	 heard Donnington's	question.	The	young	man	set	off	running	towards	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's	happened?"	he	cried	fiercely.	"Where's	Bubbles,	Varick?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	was	ashen;	and	he	looked	dazed—utterly	unlike	his	usual	collected	self. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	stumbled—and	went	over	the	side	of	the	embankment.	She's	in	the	water, </p>
<p class="calibre1">down	there,"	he	said	at	last,	in	a	hoarse,	stifled	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Donnington	 turned	 quickly,	 and	 stared	 down	 into	 the	 grey	 water.	 He	 could	 see nothing—nothing!	He	threw	off	his	coat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Was	it	just	here?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 looked	 at	 Varick	 with	 a	 feeling	 of	 anguished	 exasperation;	 it	 was	 as	 if	 the horror	and	the	shock	had	congealed	the	man's	mental	faculties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly	Varick	roused	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can	you	swim?"	He	gripped	Donnington	strongly	by	the	arm.	"If	not,	it's—it's no	good	your	going	in—you'd	only	drown	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Donnington	wrenched	himself	free	from	the	other's	hold,	and,	rushing	down	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bank,	threw	himself	into	the	icy	cold	water.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly	 he	 saw,	 a	 long	 way	 off,	 a	 small,	 shapeless,	 mass	 rising	 ...	 he	 swam towards	it,	and	then	he	gave	a	sobbing	gasp	of	relief.	It	was	Bubbles	...	Bubbles</p>
<p class="calibre1">already	 unconscious;	 but	 of	 that	 he	 was	 vaguely	 glad,	 knowing	 that	 it	 would much	simplify	his	task. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Very	 soon,	 although	 he	 was	 quite	 unaware	 of	 it,	 the	 affrighted,	 startled	 little crowd	of	people	gathered	together	just	above	the	place	where	he	was	painfully, </p>
<p class="calibre1">slowly,	 swimming	 about,	 looking	 for	 a	 spot	 where	 he	 could	 try	 and	 effect	 a landing	with	his	now	heavy,	inert	burden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Panton	threw	himself	down	flat	across	the	path	and	held	out	a	walking	stick</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	 the	 slippery	 mud	 bank,	 but	 the	 stick	 was	 hopelessly,	 grotesquely	 out	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>Donnington's	reach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	at	once	Blanche	Farrow	detached	herself	from	the	others	and	began	running</p>
<p class="calibre1">towards	 the	 cottage	 which	 formed	 the	 apex	 of	 the	 reservoir.	 "I'm	 going	 for	 a rope,"	she	called	out.	"I'll	be	back	in	three	or	four	minutes."	But,	thanks	to	Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Panton's	ingenuity,	the	man	in	the	water	had	not	to	wait	even	so	short	a	time	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Have	any	of	you	a	good	long	scarf?"	asked	the	doctor,	and	then,	quite	eagerly for	 him,	 James	 Tapster	 produced	 a	 wonderful	 scarf—the	 sort	 of	 scarf	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">millionaire	would	wear,	so	came	the	whimsical	thought	to	Sir	Lyon.	It	was	wide</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	very	long,	made	of	the	finest	knitted	silk.	When	firmly	tied	to	the	handle	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	walking	stick,	the	floating	end	of	the	scarf	was	within	reach	of	Donnington. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 its	 help	 he	 even	 managed	 to	 secure	 a	 foothold	 on	 the	 narrow	 one-brick ledge	which	terminated	the	deep	underwater	wall	of	the	reservoir. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	doctor	called	down	to	him	with	some	urgency:	"I	wish	you	could	manage	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">hoist	her	up,	Donnington.  <i class="calibre4">Time</i>	is	of	the	utmost	importance	in	these	cases!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 Donnington,	 try	 as	 he	 might,	 was	 too	 spent	 to	 obey;	 and	 it	 seemed	 an eternity	 to	 them	 all	 before	 Blanche	 Farrow	 reappeared,	 helping	 an	 old	 man	 to drag	a	short	ladder	along	the	muddy	path. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then,	 at	 last,	 after	 many	 weary,	 fruitless	 efforts,	 the	 inert,	 sodden	 mass which	had	so	lately	been	poor	little	Bubbles	Dunster	was	pushed	and	hoisted	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	slippery	bank,	and	stretched	out	on	to	the	narrow	brick	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Tapster,	who	had	shown	much	more	agitation	and	feeling	than	any	of	those</p>
<p class="calibre1">present	would	have	credited	him	with,	had	taken	off	his	big	loose	coat	and	laid	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	ground,	and	at	once	Varick	had	followed	his	example.	But	as	Bubbles	lay</p>
<p class="calibre1">there,	in	the	dreadful	immobility	of	utter	unconsciousness,	both	Blanche	Farrow</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	Helen	Brabazon	believed	her	to	be	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	tragic,	fearfully	 anxious	time	of	 suspense	followed.	Blanche	 looked	on,	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">steady,	dry	eyes,	but	Helen,	after	a	very	little	while,	turned	away	and	hid	her	face</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 her	 hands,	 sobbing,	 while	 the	 doctor	 was	 engaged	 in	 the	 painful	 process	 of trying	to	bring	the	apparently	drowned	girl	to	life.	More	than	once	Blanche	felt</p>
<p class="calibre1">tempted	 to	 implore	 him	 to	 leave	 off	 those	 terribly	 arduous	 efforts	 of	 his.	 It seemed	 to	 her	 so—so	 horrible,	 almost	 degrading,	 that	 Bubbles'	 delicate	 little body	should	be	used	like	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>Everyone	was	too	concerned	over	Bubbles	to	trouble	about	her	rescuer.	But	all	at once	Varick	exclaimed:	"We	don't	want	you	down	with	rheumatic	fever.	I'll	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">march	you	back	to	the	house,	my	boy!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not	 as	 long	 as	 she's	 here,"	 muttered	 Donnington,	 his	 teeth	 chattering.	 "I'm	 all right;	it	doesn't	matter	about	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 alone	 of	 the	 people	 gathered	 there	 believed	 that	 Dr.	 Panton's	 perseverance would	be	rewarded,	and	that	Bubbles	would	come	back	to	life.	It	did	not	seem	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	possible	that	that	which	he	had	saved,	and	which	he	so	loved	and	cherished, </p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 die.	 Though	 he	 was	 beginning	 to	 feel	 the	 reaction	 of	 all	 he	 had	 gone through,	 his	 mind	 was	 working	 clearly,	 and	 he	 was	 praying—praying</p>
<p class="calibre1">consciously,	in	an	agony	of	supplication. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	at	last,	with	a	sensation	of	relief	which	brought	the	tears	starting	to	his	eyes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	 Panton	 saw	 that	 his	 efforts	 were	 to	 be	 successful;	 Bubbles,	 after	 a	 little choking	gasp,	gave	a	long,	fluttering	sigh.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 then	 that	 the	 doctor	 had	 to	 thank	 Sir	 Lyon	 and	 Helen	 Brabazon.	 One	 of them,	 or	 both	 of	 them	 together,	 had	 thought	 of	 going	 back	 to	 the	 house	 and	 of getting	an	invalid	chair	which	Helen	remembered	having	seen	in	a	corner	of	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	rooms	when	she	had	been	shown	over	the	house	by	her	host. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	so,	it	was	a	very	melancholy	little	procession	which	followed	the	two	men</p>
<p class="calibre1">carrying	the	chair	on	which	Bubbles	now	lay	in	apathetic	silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 everything	 comes	 to	 an	 end	 at	 last,	 and,	 after	 having	 seen	 Bubbles	 put	 to bed,	 Dr.	 Panton	 turned	 his	 attention	 to	 Donnington,	 and	 he	 did	 not	 leave	 his second	 patient	 till	 the	 young	 man	 felt,	 if	 still	 shivery	 and	 queer,	 fairly comfortable	in	bed.	Then	the	doctor	went	down	to	find	the	other	three	men	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dining-room,	having	hot	drinks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	the	three	Varick	and	Sir	Lyon	showed	on	their	faces	traces	of	the	emotion	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">anxiety	 which	 they	 had	 been	 through;	 but	 James	 Tapster	 looked	 his	 normal, </p>
<p class="calibre1">phlegmatic	self. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 wonder	 what	 exactly	 happened?"	 exclaimed	 Panton	 at	 last.	 "I	 suppose	 the whole	thing	was	owing	to	these	high-heeled	shoes	which	women	 <i class="calibre4">will</i>	wear." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	 nodded,	 and,	 as	 he	 saw	 that	 Panton	 expected	 him	 to	 say	 something,	 he muttered:	"Yes,	it	must	have	been	something	of	the	kind	that	made	her	trip." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a>"It	 was	 a	 near	 thing,"	 went	 on	 the	 doctor	 thoughtfully.	 "She	 was	 very	 far	 gone when	we	got	her	out	at	last.	I	don't	mind	admitting	now	that,	when	I	began,	I	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">hardly	any	hope	of	being	able	to	bring	her	round." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	waited	a	moment	and	then	added,	as	if	to	himself:	"In	fact,	there	came	a	time</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	I	would	have	left	off,	discouraged,	but	for	the	look	on	that	boy's	face." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	boy?"	asked	Tapster,	surprised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Donnington,	of	course!	I	felt	I	must	bring	her	back	to	life	for	his	sake." </p>
<p class="calibre1">James	 Tapster	 opened	 his	 mouth.	 Then	 he	 shut	 it	 again.	 He	 told	 himself	 that	 it would,	of	course,	have	been	very	disappointing	for	Donnington	to	have	plunged</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	that	icy	water	all	for	nothing,	as	it	were. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	four	men	remained	silent	for	awhile,	and	then	Varick	said	slowly:	"She	can't</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	been	in	the	water	more	than	a	minute	before	Donnington	was	in	after	her—</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	of	course	I	gave	the	alarm	at	once." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Lyon	looked	at	him	quickly.	"I	thought	Donnington	turned	round	and	missed</p>
<p class="calibre1">her?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Donnington	must	have	heard	me	call	out."	Varick	was	lighting	a	cigarette,	and Sir	Lyon	saw	that	his	hand	shook;	"and	yet	when	I	saw	her	roll	down	the	bank	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	so	paralyzed	with	horror	that	my	voice	seemed	to	go." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	appealingly	at	his	friend	Panton. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	I	can	well	understand	that,"	said	the	doctor	feelingly.	"I	have	known	shock close	the	throat	absolutely."	He	added:	"Did	you	see	her	sink	and	rise	again	twice before	 Donnington	 got	 at	 her,	 Varick?	 I	 have	 always	 wondered	 whether</p>
<p class="calibre1">drowning	people	always	come	up	three	times—or	if	it's	only	an	old	wives'	tale." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	no,	I	can't	remember—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	 put	 his	 hand	 over	 his	 eyes,	 as	 if	 trying	 to	 shut	 out	 some	 dreadful	 sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he	groped	his	way	to	a	chair,	and	sat	down	heavily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	say,	Varick,	I	 <i class="calibre4">am</i>	sorry." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	 Panton	 looked	 really	 concerned.	 "We've	 been	 thinking	 so	 much	 of	 Miss Bubbles	and	of	her	rescuer	that	we	have	forgotten	you!"	he	exclaimed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a>Their	host	leant	forward;	he	buried	his	face	in	his	hands.	"I	shall	never	forget	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">—never,"	 he	 muttered	 brokenly.	 "The	 horror	 that	 seized	 me—the	 awful	 feeling that	I	could	do	nothing—nothing!	I	felt	so	absolutely	distraught	that	I	seemed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	 <i class="calibre4">myself</i>,	not	Bubbles,	floating	down	there—on	the	surface	of	the	water." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	up,	and	they	were	all,	even	Tapster,	painfully	impressed	by	his	look	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">retrospective	 horror.	 Dr.	 Panton	 told	 himself	 that	 Lionel	 Varick	 was	 an	 even more	sensitive	man	than	he	had	hitherto	known	him	to	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	XVII</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Dinner	was	to	be	half	an	hour	later	than	usual,	and	Dr.	Panton,	as	he	went	off	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	comfortable,	warm	room,	felt	pleasantly,	healthily	tired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 had	 gone	 in	 to	 see	 his	 patients	 for	 a	 moment	 on	 his	 way	 upstairs,	 and	 they were	 both	 going	 on	 well.	 Bubbles	 was	 beginning	 to	 look	 her	 own	 queer,	 elfish little	 self	 again.	 She	 was	 curiously	 apathetic,	 as	 people	 so	 often	 are	 after	 any kind	 of	 shock,	 but	 it	 was	 clear	 that	 there	 were	 to	 be	 no	 bad	 after-effects	 of	 the accident.	As	for	Donnington,	the	young	man	declared	that	he	felt	quite	all	right, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	he	was	even	anxious	to	get	up	for	dinner.	But	that,	of	course,	could	not	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">allowed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All's	 well	 that	 ends	 well,"	 muttered	 the	 doctor,	 as	 he	 threw	 himself	 for	 a moment	into	a	chair	drawn	up	invitingly	before	the	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 did	 go	 on	 to	 tell	 himself,	 however,	 that	 he	 now	 felt	 a	 little	 concerned	 over Lionel	Varick.	Varick	now	looked	far	more	really	ill	than	did	either	Bubbles	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bill	Donnington. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 doctor	 recalled	 a	 certain	 terrible	 day,	 rather	 over	 a	 year	 ago,	 when	 Varick had	broken	down	utterly!	It	was	the	afternoon	that	poor	Milly	was	being	put	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	coffin;	and,	by	sheer	good	luck	he,	Panton,	happened	to	call	in.	He	had	found</p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	 sitting	 alone,	 looking	 very	 desolate,	 in	 the	 dining-room	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">commonplace	 little	 villa,	 while	 from	 overhead	 there	 came	 the	 sounds	 of	 heavy feet	moving	this	way	and	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	at	once	there	had	come	a	loud	knock	at	the	front	door,	and	Varick,	starting</p>
<p class="calibre1">up,	had	uttered	a	fearful	cry.	Then,	sitting	down	again,	he	had	begun	trembling, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 if	 he	 had	 the	 ague.	 He,	 Panton,	 had	 been	 so	 concerned	 at	 the	 poor	 fellow's condition	 that	 he	 had	 insisted,	 there	 and	 then,	 on	 taking	 him	 along	 to	 his	 own house,	 and	 he	 had	 kept	 him	 there	 as	 his	 guest	 till	 the	 day	 of	 Mrs.	 Varick's funeral. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	these	memories	came	crowding	on	him,	the	door	of	his	room	opened	quietly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	the	man	who	was	filling	his	mind	walked	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a>Varick	was	already	dressed	for	dinner,	and,	not	for	the	first	time,	the	doctor	told himself	what	a	distinguished-looking	man	his	friend	and	host	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Panton,"	said	Varick	abruptly,	"I	have	something	on	my	mind." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	doctor	looked	up,	surprised.	"What	is	it,	my	dear	fellow?"	he	asked	kindly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 can't	 help	 thinking	 that	 in	 some	 inexplicable	 way	 I	 pushed	 Bubbles	 Dunster over	the	edge	of	that	embankment.	Has	she	said	anything	to	you	about	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	 Panton	 got	 up	 and	 came	 over	 to	 the	 speaker.	 He	 put	 his	 hand	 heavily	 on Varick's	shoulder,	and	almost	forced	him	down	into	the	chair	from	which	he	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself	risen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Look	 here,"	 he	 exclaimed,	 "this	 won't	 do	 at	 all!	 Pull	 yourself	 together,	 man—</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	 mustn't	 get	 such	 fancies	 into	 your	 head.	 That	 way	 madness	 lies.	 Still,	 you may	as	well	try	and	get	it	off	your	chest	once	for	all.	Tell	me	exactly	what	 <i class="calibre4">did</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">happen?	Begin	at	the	beginning—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 Varick	 remained	 silent,	 the	 doctor	 went	 on,	 encouragingly:	 "I	 will	 start	 you by	 reminding	 you	 that	 Miss	 Bubbles	 was	 wearing	 the	 most	 absurd	 high-heeled</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoes.	Young	Donnington	spoke	to	her	about	them,	and	that	drew	my	attention	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	feet	as	we	came	out	of	the	gate.	She	even	tripped	when	we	were	just	past	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bridge.	Do	you	remember	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	I	didn't	notice	her	at	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	 tell	 me	 exactly	 what	 happened	 just	 before	 she	 fell	 over	 the	 edge	 of	 the embankment?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	know	that	there's	very	much	to	tell."	Varick	was	now	staring	into	the	fire, but	at	last	he	began	in	a	strained,	tired	voice:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Donnington	 had	 just	 shouted	 out	 that	 we	 were	 walking	 rather	 too	 near	 to	 the edge,	and	so	I	took	hold	of	her	arm.	But	you	know	what	Bubbles	is	like?	She's	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">queer	 kind	 of	 girl,	 and	 she	 tried	 to	 wrench	 herself	 free.	 Then	 I	 gripped	 a	 little harder	 and—well,	 I	 don't	 know	 exactly	 what	 did	 happen!	 I	 suppose	 her	 foot</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned,	for	I	suddenly	felt	her	weight	full	on	me,	and	then,	and	then—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,"	 said	 Dr.	 Panton	 soothingly,	 "I	 know	 exactly	 what	 happened.	 You instinctively	 straightened	 yourself	 to	 try	 to	 put	 her	 on	 her	 feet	 again,	 but	 she'd already	lost	her	balance—" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a>"I	suppose	that's	what	did	happen,"	said	Varick	in	a	low	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"—And	 her	 foot	 turning	 again,	 she	 rolled	 down	 the	 steep	 embankment," </p>
<p class="calibre1">concluded	the	doctor	firmly.	"You	did	nothing,	my	dear	chap,	absolutely	nothing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">to	bring	the	accident	about!	Put	that	idea,	once	and	for	all,	out	of	your	mind." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	would,"	said	Varick	painfully,	"I	would,	but	that	I'm	afraid—in	fact,	I	feel	sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">—that	she	thinks	I	pushed	her	in.	She	turned	the	most	awful	look	on	me,	Panton, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	she	fell	over	the	edge.	I	shall	never	forget	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	look	had	nothing	to	do	with	you,"	said	the	doctor	decidedly.	"It	was	simply the	terrified	look	of	a	human	being	on	the	brink	of	a	frightful	death." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're	a	good	friend,"	muttered	Varick,	getting	up.	"I'll	leave	you	to	dress	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait	 a	 moment!"	 exclaimed	 Panton;	 "there's	 one	 thing	 about	 Miss	 Bubbles' </p>
<p class="calibre1">accident	which	does	trouble	me,	I	admit.	It	puzzled	me	at	the	time;	and	I	can	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	is	puzzling	young	Donnington	too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick,	who	was	already	at	the	door,	stayed	his	steps	and	turned	round. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 had	 come	 back	 into	 his	 face	 the	 strained	 look	 which	 had	 softened	 away while	 he	 listened	 to	 his	 friend's	 sensible	 remarks.	 "Yes,"	 he	 said	 impatiently, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"yes,	Panton?	What	is	it	that	puzzles	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	wish	I	knew	exactly	how	long	Miss	Bubbles	was	in	the	water.	She	was	very, </p>
<p class="calibre1">very	far	gone	when	that	boy	managed	to	clutch	hold	of	her.	Did	you	see	her	go</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	 again,	 and	 come	 up	 again	 twice?	 Forgive	 me,	 my	 dear	 fellow,	 I'm	 afraid I'm	distressing	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	 asked	 me	 that	 downstairs,"	 said	 Varick,	 "and	 I	 told	 you	 then	 that—that	 I didn't	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 thought,"	 said	 Dr.	 Panton,	 "that	 you	 remembered	 so	 clearly	 all	 that	 had happened—by	what	you	said	just	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	up	to	the	moment	when	she	fell	in,	I	remember	everything.	But	once	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	in	the	water	everything	became	blurred.	All	I	can	say	is	that	it	seemed	as	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">hours	drifted	by	before	I	saw	you	all	come	running	up	towards	me—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come,	come,"	said	Panton,	a	trifle	impatiently.	"As	a	matter	of	fact	it	can't	have been	more	than	three	minutes.	Still,	it	was	long	enough	for	the	girl	to	go	as	near</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Great	Divide,	as	a	friend	of	mine	calls	it,	as	I've	ever	known	a	human	being</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a>go." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 suppose,"	 said	 Varick	 slowly,	 "that	 if	 you	 hadn't	 been	 there	 Bubbles	 would now	be	dead?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	yes,	I'm	afraid	that's	true,"	said	the	doctor	simply.	"I	should	have	expected that	 clever,	 intelligent	 Miss	 Farrow,	 to	 say	 nothing	 of	 Miss	 Brabazon,	 to	 know something	about	First	Aid.	But	neither	of	them	know	anything!	The	only	person</p>
<p class="calibre1">who	was	of	the	slightest	use	was	young	Donnington;	and	I	suspect—"	he	smiled</p>
<p class="calibre1">broadly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	do	you	suspect?"	asked	Varick	rather	quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	I	suspect	that	he's	in	love	with	Miss	Bubbles." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	 course	 he	 is."	 Varick's	 contemptuous	 tone	 jarred	 a	 little	 on	 Panton.	 "But Bubbles	intends	to	become	Mrs.	Tapster." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	should	be	sorry	to	think	that!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why	sorry?	The	modern	young	woman—and	Bubbles	is	a	very	modern	young</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman—knows	the	value	of	money,"	said	Varick	dryly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	waited	a	moment.	"I'll	leave	you	now,	Panton,	and	I'll	see	that	the	dinner-bell isn't	rung	till	you're	quite	ready." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All	right.	I	won't	be	ten	minutes—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 Varick	 lingered	 by	 the	 door.	 "Panton,"	 he	 exclaimed,	 "you've	 been	 a	 good friend	 to	 me!	 I	 want	 to	 tell	 you	 that	 I	 shall	 never	 forget	 it.	 As	 long	 as	 there's breath	in	my	body	I	shall	be	grateful	to	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 the	 doctor	 dressed	 he	 told	 himself	 again	 that	 Varick	 had	 never	 really</p>
<p class="calibre1">recovered	 from	 the	 strain	 of	 his	 wife's	 long	 illness.	 Under	 that	 rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">exceptionally	 calm,	 steadfast-looking	 exterior,	 the	 man	 was	 extraordinarily</p>
<p class="calibre1">sensitive.	How	upset,	for	instance,	Varick	had	been	about	Miss	Pigchalke's	crazy</p>
<p class="calibre1">advertisement.	He,	Panton,	had	felt	quite	sorry	that	he	had	said	anything	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	putting	on	his	tie,	he	told	himself	that	what	the	dear	fellow	wanted	now</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 a	 good,	 sensible	 second	 wife.	 And	 then,	 as	 he	 formulated	 that	 thought	 to himself,	the	young	man—for	he	was	still	quite	a	young	man—stopped	what	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 doing,	 and	 rubbed	 his	 hands	 joyfully.	 Why,	 of	 course!	 What	 a	 fool	 he	 had been	 never	 to	 think	 of	 it	 before—though	 to	 be	 sure	 it	 would	 really	 have	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a>almost	indecent	to	have	thought	of	it	before.	Helen	Brabazon?	The	very	woman for	 Lionel	 Varick!	 Such	 a	 marriage	 would	 be	 the	 making	 of	 his	 highly-strung, fine-natured	friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 he	 hurriedly	 finished	 dressing,	 Panton	 plumed	 himself	 on	 his	 cleverness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	all	his	heart	he	hoped	the	day	would	come	when	he	would	be	able	to	say	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick:	"Ages	before	 <i class="calibre4">you</i>	thought	of	her,	old	chap,  <i class="calibre4">I</i>	selected	Miss	Brabazon	as your	 future	 bride!"	 He	 hoped,	 uneasily,	 that	 Sir	 Lyon	 was	 not	 seriously	 in	 the running.	But	he	had	noticed	that	Sir	Lyon	and	Miss	Brabazon	seemed	to	have	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">good	deal	to	say	to	one	another.	Women,	so	he	told	himself	ruefully,	like	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">"My	lady."	But	she	was	certainly	fond	of	Varick—she	had	been	fond	of	him	(of course,	only	as	a	woman	may	be	of	a	friend's	husband)	during	those	sad	weeks	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Redsands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 the	 doctor	 came	 out	 of	 his	 room	 he	 decided	 to	 go	 in	 for	 a	 moment	 and	 see Bubbles	Dunster.	Somehow	he	did	not	feel	quite	easy	about	her.	He	wondered, </p>
<p class="calibre1">uncomfortably,	if	there	could	be	anything	in	Varick's	painful	suspicion.	After	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">aunt	and	Helen	Brabazon	between	them	had	put	her	to	bed,	and	he	had	come	in, </p>
<p class="calibre1">alone,	 to	 see	 how	 she	 was,	 she	 had	 said	 abruptly:	 "I	 wonder	 if	 it's	 true	 that doctors	can	keep	a	secret	better	than	most	men?"	And	when	he	had	made	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">joking	 answer,	 she	 had	 asked,	 in	 a	 very	 serious	 tone:	 "You're	 a	 great	 friend	 of Lionel	Varick,	eh?"	He	had	answered:	"Men	don't	vow	eternal	friendships	in	the way	 I'm	 told	 young	 ladies	 do;	 but,	 yes,	 I	 hope	 I	 am	 a	 great	 friend	 of	 Lionel Varick's.	 I've	 a	 high	 opinion	 of	 him,	 Miss	 Bubbles,	 and	 I've	 seen	 him	 under circumstances	that	test	a	man." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 had	 looked	 at	 him	 fixedly	 while	 he	 said	 these	 words,	 and	 then	 she	 had opened	 and	 shut	 her	 eyes	 in	 a	 very	 odd	 way.	 He	 now	 asked	 himself	 if	 it	 was probable—possible—conceivable—that	she	blamed	Varick	for	her	accident?	He, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick,	evidently	thought	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then,	as	he	walked	along	the	darkened	corridor,	there	came	over	Dr.	Panton</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	most	extraordinary	feeling— <i class="calibre4">a	feeling	that	he	was	not	alone. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 stayed	 his	 steps,	 and	 listened	 intently.	 But	 the	 only	 sound	 he	 heard	 was	 the ticking	 of	 a	 clock.	 He	 walked	 on,	 and	 all	 at	 once	 there	 came	 a	 word	 repeated twice,	quite	distinctly,	almost	as	if	in	his	ear.	It	was	a	disagreeable,	an	offensive</p>
<p class="calibre1">word—a	word,	or	rather	an	appellation,	which	the	clever	young	doctor	had	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">heard	applied	to	himself	for	a	good	many	years.	For,	twice	over,	was	the	word</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a>"Fool!"	repeated	in	a	mocking	voice,	a	voice	to	whose	owner	he	could	not	at	the moment	put	a	name,	and	yet	which	seemed	vaguely	familiar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he	remembered.	Why,	of	course,	it	was	the	voice	of	that	crazy,	unpleasant</p>
<p class="calibre1">old	 woman	 who	 had	 called	 on	 him	 last	 spring!	 But	 how	 had	 Miss	 Pigchalke</p>
<p class="calibre1">found	her	way	into	Wyndfell	Hall?	And	where	on	earth	was	she? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	round	him,	this	way	and	that;	and	his	eyes,	by	now	accustomed	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dim	 light	 thrown	 by	 a	 hanging	 lamp,	 saw	 everything	 quite	 distinctly.	 He	 was certainly	 alone	 in	 the	 corridor	 now.	 But	 Miss	 Pigchalke	 had	 as	 certainly	 been there	a	moment	ago.	He	wondered	if	she	could	have	hidden	herself	in	a	huge	oak</p>
<p class="calibre1">chest	which	stood	to	his	right?	Nay,	there	she	could	not	be,	for	he	remembered</p>
<p class="calibre1">having	been	shown	that	it	was	full	of	eighteenth-century	gala	gowns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	while	he	was	looking	about	him,	feeling	utterly	perplexed	and	bewildered, </p>
<p class="calibre1">through	a	door	which	was	ajar	there	suddenly	passed	out	Lionel	Varick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	anyone	in	there?"	asked	the	doctor	sharply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	started	violently.	"You	did	startle	me!"	he	exclaimed.	"No,	there's	no	one in	there—I	came	up	to	look	for	a	book.	But	as	I	told	them	to	delay	dinner	yet	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	longer,	would	you	mind	if	we	went	in	and	saw	Bubbles	together	on	our	way</p>
<p class="calibre1">downstairs?	I	feel	I	should	rather	like	to	get	my	first	interview	with	her	over—</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	with	you	there." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 don't	 see	 why	 you	 shouldn't."	 But	 there	 was	 a	 doubtful	 ring	 in	 Dr.	 Panton's voice.	 He	 would,	 as	 a	 matter	 of	 fact,	 have	 very	 much	 preferred	 that	 Varick should	not	see	the	girl	to-night,	especially	if	there	was	the	slightest	truth	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">other's	 suspicion	 that	 Bubbles	 believed	 him	 to	 have	 been	 in	 any	 way</p>
<p class="calibre1">instrumental,	however	accidentally,	in	making	her	fall	into	the	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	mind	worked	quickly,	as	minds	are	apt	to	work	when	faced	with	that	sort	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">problem,	and	he	decided	that	on	the	whole	he	might	as	well	let	Varick	do	as	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">wished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You'd	better	not	say	very	much	to	her.	Just	say	you	hope	she's	feeling	all	right by	now—or	something	of	that	sort." </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	when	they	came	to	the	closed	door	of	the	girl's	room	he	turned	and	said:	"I'll just	go	in	and	prepare	her	for	your	visit—if	you	don't	mind?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a>Bubbles	was	lying	straight	down	in	bed,	for,	at	her	own	request,	the	bolster	had been	taken	away.	Her	head	was	only	just	raised	up	on	the	pillow.	By	the	light	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	one	candle	he	could	see	her	slender	form	outlined	under	the	bed-clothes.	Her</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes	 were	 closed,	 her	 features	 pinched	 and	 worn.	 There	 was	 something	 almost deathly	in	the	look	of	her	little	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 wondered	 if	 she	 was	 asleep—if	 so,	 it	 would	 be	 rather	 a	 relief	 to	 him	 to	 go outside	the	door	and	tell	Varick	that	she	mustn't	be	disturbed.	But	all	at	once	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">opened	her	eyes	widely,	and	there	even	came	the	quiver	of	a	smile	over	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Doctor?"	 she	 said	 plaintively.	 "Doctor,	 come	 nearer,	 I	 want	 to	 ask	 you	 a question." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes?"	he	said.	"What	is	it,	Miss	Bubbles?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 want	 to	 ask	 you,"	 she	 said	 dreamily,	 "why	 you	 brought	 me	 back?	 I	 was beginning	 to	 feel	 so	 much	 at	 home	 in	 the	 grey	 world.	 There	 were	 such	 kind people	there,	waiting	to	welcome	me.	Only	one	friend	I	felt	sad	to	leave	behind--</p>
<p class="calibre1">--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tut-tut!"	 he	 said,	 a	 little	 startled.	 "You	 were	 never	 anywhere	 near	 leaving	 us, Miss	Bubbles." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	know	I	was,	and	you	know	it,	too.	But	you	called	me	back.	Confess	that	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">did!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	confess	nothing	of	the	sort,"	he	answered	a	little	shortly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	little	pause,	and	then	he	went	on,	"There's	someone	outside	the	door</p>
<p class="calibre1">who	 wants	 to	 see	 you;	 someone	 who's	 feeling	 most	 awfully	 miserable	 about</p>
<p class="calibre1">you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	look	of	unease	and	of	anxiety	came	over	her	face.	"D'you	mean	Mr.	Tapster?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	said	hesitatingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good	heavens,	no!"	He	was	surprised,	and	a	little	disgusted.	"Can't	you	guess who	it	is?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	saw	the	look	in	her	face	grow	to	shrinking	fear.	"I	can't	guess	at	all,"	she	said weakly.	 "You	 won't	 allow	 Bill	 to	 get	 up—I	 know	 that	 because	 he	 sent	 me	 a message.	Bill's	the	only	person	I	want	to	see." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He'll	come	soon	enough,"	said	Dr.	Panton,	smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a>"It	was	really	Bill	who	saved	me,"	she	went	on,	as	if	speaking	to	herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	 course	 it	 was	 Bill!"	 he	 spoke	 now	 with	 hearty	 assent.	 "You've	 a	 splendid friend	in	that	young	man,	Miss	Bubbles,	and	I	hope	you're	properly	grateful	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">him?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	think	I	am,"	she	said	slowly.	"I'm	trying	to	be." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	the	other	friend	who	wants	to	see	you—may	he	come	in	for	a	minute?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	other	friend?	Do	you	mean	Sir	Lyon?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	no—of	course	not!"	He	spoke	with	a	touch	of	impatience	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mr.	 Tapster,"	 said	 Bubbles,	 nervously	 flying	 off	 at	 a	 tangent,	 "wants	 me	 to marry	 him,	 Dr.	 Panton.	 He	 asked	 me—was	 it	 yesterday	 morning,	 or	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1">morning?"	She	knitted	her	brows.	"Of	course,	I	had	to	help	him	out.	The	moment he'd	said	it,	he	began	to	hope	that	I'd	say	'No'—so	I	thought	I'd	punish	him,	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaving	him	in	suspense	a	bit." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	was	very	distressed	at	your	accident,"	said	the	doctor	rather	stiffly.	Bubbles' </p>
<p class="calibre1">queer	confidence	had	startled	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Most	men	only	really	want	what	they	feel	is	out	of	their	reach,"	she	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"When	he	thought	me	gone,	he	wanted	me	back	again.	He's	like	that.	He'll	make</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	much	nicer	widower	than	he	will	a	husband!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	up	and	smiled,	but	he	felt	as	if	she	was	keeping	him	at	arm's	length. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	Mr.	Varick	who's	outside	the	door	and	who	wants	to	come	in	and	see	you," </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	said	suddenly,	in	a	matter-of-fact	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	turned	her	head	away	quickly.	"Not	to-night,	doctor;	I'm	too	tired."	She spoke	very	decidedly,	and	in	a	stronger	voice	than	she	had	yet	used.	"I'd	rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">wait	till	I	get	up	before	seeing	Mr.	Varick." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	only	wants	to	come	in	for	a	minute—do	see	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	 Panton	 spoke	 persuasively,	 but	 he	 told	 himself	 that	 Varick	 was	 right—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	  <i class="calibre4">had</i>	 got	 that	 extraordinary,	 horrible	 notion	 into	 her	 head.	 "He's	 very much	upset,"	he	went	on,	"he	thinks	that	unconsciously	he	may	have	given	you some	kind	of	push	over	the	edge	of	the	embankment." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	saw	her	face	change.	It	crimsoned	darkly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a>"Has	he	told	you	that?"	she	muttered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	he	has;	and	he's	awfully	upset	about	it,	Miss	Bubbles." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	suppose	I	had	better	see	him.	I	shall	have	to	see	him	some	time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	said	the	words	between	her	teeth,	and,	making	an	effort,	she	sat	up	in	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Panton	went	to	the	door,	and	opened	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come	in,"	he	called	out;	"but	don't	stay	long,	Varick.	Miss	Bubbles	is	very	tired to-night." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	 came	 in	 slowly	 and	 advanced	 with	 curiously	 hesitating,	 nervous	 steps, towards	 the	 bed.	 "Well,	 Bubbles,"	 he	 exclaimed,	 "I'm	 glad	 you're	 no	 worse	 for your	ducking!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	at	him	fixedly,	but	said	nothing.	Dr.	Panton	began	to	feel	desperately</p>
<p class="calibre1">uncomfortable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	hope	you'll	be	quite	all	right	to-morrow,"	went	on	Varick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	think	I	shall,	thank	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	seemed	to	be	looking	beyond	her	visitor—not	at	him.	She	seemed	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">gazing	at	something	at	the	other	end	of	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You've	brought	someone	in	with	you,"	she	said	suddenly.	There	was	a	curious tone—almost	 a	 tone	 of	 exultation—in	 her	 voice.	 "Who	 is	 it?"	 she	 asked imperiously.	"Tell	me	who	it	is—Lionel." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	very	rarely	called	Varick	"Lionel." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wheeled	round	with	a	startled	look.	"There's	no	one	here,"	he	answered,	"but Dr.	Panton	and	myself." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh	yes,	there	is."	Bubbles	spoke	very	positively.	"There's	a	woman	here.	I	can see	 her	 quite	 distinctly	 in	 the	 firelight.	 She's	 got	 a	 fat,	 angry	 face,	 and	 untidy grey	hair.	Hullo,	she's	gone	now!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	 fell	 back	 on	 to	 her	 pillow	 and	 closed	 her	 eyes.	 It	 was	 as	 if	 she	 was dismissing	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	turned	uneasily	to	the	doctor.	"Is	she	delirious?"	he	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a>The	doctor	shook	 his	head.	He	 also	was	startled—startled	 more	than	 surprised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	in	just	Bubbles'	words	would	he	have	described	the	odious	woman	who	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">come	 to	 see	 him	 last	 spring,	 and	 whose	 voice	 he	 had	 heard	 within	 the	 last	 few minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 now	 had	 no	 doubt	 that	 Miss	 Pigchalke	 had	 been	 in	 the	 corridor,	 or,	 more likely,	in	some	room	opening	out	of	it,	and	that	she	had	followed	Varick	into	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">darkened	room	and	then,	noiselessly,	slipped	out	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	opened	her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	come	up	after	dinner	for	a	few	minutes,"	said	Dr.	Panton.	Bubbles	made	no answer;	her	eyes	were	now	following	Varick	out	of	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 doctor	 lingered	 for	 a	 moment.	 "You're	  <i class="calibre4">sure</i>	 there	 was	 someone	 there?"	 he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	 course	 I'm	 sure."	 Bubbles	 spoke	 quite	 positively.	 "I'm	 sure"—and	 then	 he saw	a	change	come	over	her	face—"and	yet	I	don't	know	that	I	am	quite	sure," </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	murmured	dreamily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Dr.	Panton	went	down	the	shallow	oak	staircase	he	felt	in	a	turmoil	of	doubt</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	discomfort.	To	his	mind	there	was	no	reasonable	doubt	that	Miss	Pigchalke</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	somehow	effected	an	entrance	to	Wyndfell	Hall.	She	had	lived	there	for	long</p>
<p class="calibre1">years;	she	must	know	every	corner	of	the	strange	old	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	reached	the	hall	where	the	whole	party	was	gathered	together,	he	went</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	to	Blanche	Farrow.	"May	I	speak	to	you	a	moment?"	he	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	is	it?"	she	asked	anxiously.	"Isn't	Bubbles	so	well?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	 yes;	 Miss	 Bubbles	 is	 going	 on	 all	 right.	 But,	 Miss	 Farrow?	 I	 want	 to	 tell you	something	that,	if	possible,	I	should	like	to	keep	from	Varick." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes—what	is	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Someone	 who	 has	 a	 grudge	 against	 him,	 a	 tiresome	 old	 woman	 who	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">companion	to	Mrs.	Varick	for	many	years,	has	somehow	got	into	this	house.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">spoke	to	me	just	as	I	came	out	of	my	room.	I	didn't	see	her,	but	I	heard	her	voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">quite	 distinctly.	 And	 when	 Varick	 and	 I	 went	 into	 Miss	 Bubbles'	 room	 for	 a moment,	 on	 our	 way	 downstairs,	 she	 followed	 us	 in—Miss	 Bubbles	 described</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	exactly.	Then	suddenly	she	disappeared.	I	am	sure	she's	hiding	in	one	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a>bedrooms." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	a	horrid	idea!"	exclaimed	Blanche. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now	 comes	 the	 question—can	 we	 manage	 to	 hunt	 her	 out,	 and	 get	 her	 away from	the	house,	without	Varick	knowing?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	why	shouldn't	he	know?"	asked	Blanche	hesitatingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Look	 at	 him,"	 said	 the	 doctor	 impressively.	 And	 Blanche,	 glancing	 quickly across	the	room,	was	struck	by	Varick's	look	of	illness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There's	no	reason	for	telling	him	anything	about	it,"	she	admitted.	"But	hadn't we	better	wait	till	after	dinner	before	doing	anything?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Perhaps	we	had." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dinner	was	a	curious,	uncomfortable	meal;	even	Sir	Lyon	and	Helen	Brabazon</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt	the	atmosphere	charged	with	anxiety	and	depression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Burnaby	alone	was	her	usual	placid,	quietly	greedy	self.	She	had	expressed</p>
<p class="calibre1">suitable	 regret	 at	 all	 that	 had	 happened,	 but	 most	 of	 the	 party	 realized	 that	 she had	not	really	cared	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 the	 ladies	 passed	 through	 into	 the	 white	 parlour,	 Blanche	 slipped	 away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	got	hold	of	her	firm	ally,	the	butler,	and	explained	in	a	very	few	words	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 thought	 had	 better	 be	 done.	 Accompanied	 by	 Pegler,	 they	 went	 into	 every room,	and	into	every	nook	and	cranny	of	the	house,	upstairs	and	down—but	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">found	no	trace	of	any	alien	presence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Pigchalke,	so	much	was	clear,	had	vanished	as	quietly	and	silently	as	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	come. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	XVIII</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">One—two—three—four—five—six—Bubbles	 heard	 the	 clock	 in	 the	 dark</p>
<p class="calibre1">corridor	 outside	 her	 room	 ring	 out	 the	 harmonious	 chimes,	 and	 she	 turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">restlessly	round	in	her	warm,	comfortable	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	very	annoying	to	think	she	would	have	to	wait	two	hours	for	a	cup	of	tea, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	there	it	was!	She	had	herself	told	Pegler	she	didn't	want	to	be	disturbed	till</p>
<p class="calibre1">eight	o'clock.	She	still	felt	too	"done,"	too	weak,	to	get	up	and	try	to	find	her	way to	the	kitchen	to	make	herself	some	tea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 lay,	 with	 her	 eyes	 wide	 open,	 longing	 for	 the	 daylight,	 and	 looking	 back with	shrinking	fear	to	a	night	full	of	a	misty	horror. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again	 and	 again	 she	 had	 lived	 through	 that	 awful	 moment	 when	 Varick	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">pushed	her	over	the	edge	of	the	embankment,	to	roll	quickly,	softly,	inexorably, </p>
<p class="calibre1">into	the	icy-cold	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	knew	he	had	pushed	her	over.	To	herself	it	was	a	fact	which	did	not	admit	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	doubt	at	all.	She	had	seen	the	mingled	hatred	and	relief	which	had	convulsed</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	face.	It	was	with	that	face	she	would	always	see	Lionel	Varick	henceforth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	had	been	a	moment	when	she	had	thought	she	would	tell	Dr.	Panton;	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	had	come	to	the	conclusion	that	there	was	no	good	purpose	to	be	served	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">telling	the	strange	and	dreadful	truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	noble	lines	of	Swinburne's	which	had	once	been	quoted	to	her	by	a	friend</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	loved,	floated	into	her	mind—</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	ye,	keep	ye	on	earth</p>
<p class="calibre1">Your	lips	from	over-speech, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Loud	words	and	longing	are	so	little	worth; </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	the	end	is	hard	to	reach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	silence	after	grievous	thing's	is	good, </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	reverence,	and	the	fear	that	makes	men	whole</p>

<p class="calibre1">But	silence	is	most	noble	till	the	end." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	she	lay	there,	feeling	physically	so	ill	and	weak,	while	yet	her	mind	worked</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	clearly	and	quickly,	she	set	herself	to	solve	a	painful	puzzle.	Why	had	Varick</p>
<p class="calibre1">tried	to	do	her	to	death?	She	admitted	to	herself	that	she	had	never	liked	him,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 had	 never	 done	 him	 any	 harm.	 And	 they	 had	 been	 on	 good	 terms—</p>
<p class="calibre1">outwardly—always. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	hours,	amid	fitful,	nightmarish	snatches	of	sleep,	and	long,	lucid	intervals	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought,	Bubbles	had	wrestled	with	the	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then,	lying	there	in	the	early	morning,	Bubbles	 <i class="calibre4">suddenly	knew</i>.	Varick	hated and	feared	her	because	she	had	unwittingly	raised	his	wife	from	the	dead.	And, </p>
<p class="calibre1">believing	that	if	he	killed	her,	he	would	lay	that	sinister,	vengeful,	unquiet	ghost, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	had	deliberately	planned	yesterday's	expedition	in	order	to	do	that	which	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	so	nearly	succeeded	in	doing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	 gave	 an	 eerie	 little	 chuckle	 which	 startled	 herself.	 "I'd	 have	 haunted him!"	 she	 muttered	 aloud.	 "He'd	 have	 found	 it	 more	 difficult	 to	 get	 rid	 of	 me dead	than	alive." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	 as	 she	 murmured	 the	 words,	 the	 door	 opened,	 and	 she	 heard	 a	 voice	 say, hesitatingly,	"Then	you're	awake,	Bubbles?	Somehow	I	felt	you	were	awake,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	you	might	like	a	cup	of	tea." </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	Bill	Donnington,	with	a	lighted	candle	in	one	hand,	and	a	cup	of	tea	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	glad	she	was	to	see	him!	How	very,	very	glad!	Yet	he	only	looked	his	usual</p>
<p class="calibre1">sober,	 unromantic	 self,	 standing	 there	 at	 the	 bottom	 of	 her	 pretty	 old	 walnut-wood	bed,	looking	at	her	with	all	his	wistful,	faithful	soul	in	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bill	was	fully	dressed,	and	Bubbles	burst	out	laughing,	feebly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	 <i class="calibre4">are</i>	an	early	bird!"	she	exclaimed.	"And	a	very	proper	bird,	too.	I	suppose you	thought	you	mustn't	come	into	my	room	in	a	dressing-gown?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	haven't	slept	all	night,"	he	said	stiffly.	"So	I	got	up	an	hour	ago.	I	came	and looked	 in	 here,	 as	 a	 matter	 of	 fact,	 on	 my	 way	 to	 the	 bathroom.	 But	 you	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a>asleep.	 And	 then,	 after	 I	 was	 dressed,	 I	 went	 down	 to	 the	 kitchen,	 and	 made myself	a	cup	of	tea.	I	thought	I'd	make	one	for	you,	too,	just	on	chance." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	came	up	close	to	her,	and	Bubbles,	shaking	back	her	short	curly	hair,	took	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cup	from	him.	"This	 <i class="calibre4">is</i>	delicious!	You	 <i class="calibre4">are</i>	a	good	sort,	Bill!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	sat	down	on	the	end	of	her	bed	while	she	thirstily,	greedily,	drank	the	tea	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	brought	her.	In	all	her	gestures	there	was	something	bird-like	and	exquisite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	when	she	was	greedy	Bubbles	was	dainty	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	do	hope	you're	feeling	none	the	worse"—he	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	she	mimicked	him,	gleefully,	speaking	in	a	low	whisper.	"None	the	worse, </p>
<p class="calibre1">thank	 you!	 It's	 a	 comfort,	 sometimes,	 to	 be	 with	 a	 person	 who	 always	 says exactly	 what	 you	 might	 expect	 he	 would	 say!	 I'm	 always	 sure	 of	 that	 comfort with	you—old	thing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are	 you?"	 He	 smiled	 his	 slow,	 doubtful	 smile,	 and	 Bubbles	 said	 suddenly:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You've	gone	and	left	the	door	open." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stood	up,	irresolute.	"I	suppose	I	ought	to	go	away,"	he	said	hesitatingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	exclaimed:	"No,	no,	Bill!	I	won't	have	you	go	away!	I	don't	want	you	to	go</p>
<p class="calibre1">away!	I	want	you	to	stay	with	me.	But	you	must	shut	the	door,	for	it's	very	cold." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"D'you	think	I'd	better	shut	the	door?"	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	Bubbles	seized	his	lean,	strong	hand.	"Oh!	I	see	what	you	mean!"	she exclaimed.	"You	actually	think	your	being	in	here	is	more	proper	if	the	door	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">open?	But	it	isn't	a	bit—for	everyone	in	the	house	but	us	two	is	fast	asleep!	Still, </p>
<p class="calibre1">that	won't	go	on	long.	So	shut	the	door	at	once!	I've	something	very	important	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">say	 to	 you—something	 which	 I	 certainly	 don't	 want	 Pegler	 to	 hear	 me	 say	 to you.	 Pegler	 may	 come	 down	 any	 moment—she's	 such	 a	 good	 sort,	 under	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">stiff,	cross	manner.	It's	so	queer	she	should	disapprove	of	me,	and	approve	of	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">Aunt	Blanche,	isn't	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	got	up,	and	going	to	the	door,	shut	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lock	 it!"	 she	 called	 out.	 "Lock	 it,	 Bill!	 I	 don't	 want	 to	 be	 disturbed;"	 she repeated	in	an	odd	voice,	"I've	something	very	important	to	say	to	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	this	time	he	did	not	obey	her,	and	as	he	came	back	towards	the	bed	he	said</p>
<p class="calibre1">anxiously,	"D'you	still	feel	 <i class="calibre4">very</i>	bad,	Bubbles?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a>There	was	a	tone	of	great	tenderness	and	solicitude	in	his	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	course	I	do.	So	would	you,	if	you'd	died	and	come	to	life	again." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	didn't	do	that,"	he	said	in	a	low	voice.	"But	you	were	very	nearly	drowned, Bubbles.	However,	we	must	try	to	forget	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again	she	mimicked	him:	"'We	must	try	to	forget	it.'	I	was	waiting	for	you	to	say that,	too.	As	if	we	should	ever	forget	it!	But	we	won't	think	about	it	just	now—</p>
<p class="calibre1">because	 we've	 got	 to	 think	 of	 something	 else	 that's	 much	 more	 to	 the	 present purpose." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,"	he	said	soothingly.	"Yes,	Bubbles?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poor	Bill	felt	very	uncomfortable.	He	did	not	wish	prim	Miss	Pegler	to	come	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 find	 him	 sitting	 on	 Bubbles'	 bed,	 when	 no	 one	 was	 yet	 up	 in	 the	 house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These	modern,	unconventional	ways	were	all	very	well,	and	he	knew	they	often</p>
<p class="calibre1">did	not	really	mean	anything,	but	still—but	still	... </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did	you	ever	hear	of	the	King's	Serf?"	asked	Bubbles	suddenly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	King's	Serf?"	he	repeated,	bewildered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"When	the	rope	which	was	hanging	some	poor	devil	of	a	highwayman	broke—</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	the	axe	was	too	blunt	to	cut	a	robber	rascal's	head	off—when	a	man	being</p>
<p class="calibre1">condemned	to	death	survived	by	some	extraordinary	accident—well,	such	a	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">became	 thereafter	 the	 King's	 Serf.	 He	 belonged	 to	 the	 King,	 body,	 soul,	 and spirit,	 and	 no	 one	 but	 the	 King	 could	 touch	 him.	 He	 lost	 his	 identity.	 He	 was above	the	law!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	said	all	this	very,	very	fast—almost	as	if	she	had	learnt	it	off	by	heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	a	curious	thing,"	said	Bill	slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	had	so	many	queer,	out-of-the-way	bits	of	knowledge.	She	was	always</p>
<p class="calibre1">surprising	 him	 by	 the	 things	 she	 knew.	 It	 was	 the	 more	 curious	 that	 she	 never seemed	to	open	a	book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come	a	little	nearer,"	she	ordered.	"You're	so	far	away,	Bill!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	spoke	with	a	touch	of	imperious	fretfulness,	and	he	moved	a	little	further	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nearer,	nearer!"	she	cried;	and	then	she	suddenly	sat	up	in	bed,	and	flinging	her</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a>arms	round	him,	she	laid	her	dark,	curly	head	on	his	faithful	heart.	"I	want	to	tell you,"	she	whispered,	"that	from	now	onward	I'm	Bill	Donnington's	Serf—much</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	than	that	poor	brute	I've	told	you	of	was	ever	the	King's	Serf.	For,	after	all, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	King	hadn't	cut	the	rope,	or	blunted	the	edge	of	the	hatchet----" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bubbles!"	he	exclaimed.	"Oh,	Bubbles,	d'you	really	mean	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	 course	 I	 mean	 it!	 What	 I	 gave	 I	 had,	 what	 I	 gained	 I	 lost,	 what	 I	 lost	 I gained." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	do	you	mean,	darling?"	he	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	mean	that	the	moment	that	stupid	doctor	allows	me	to	get	up—then	you	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	skip	off	by	ourselves,	and	we'll	say,	'Hullo,	here's	a	church!	Let's	go	in	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	married.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	waited	a	moment,	but	Bill	Donnington	said	nothing.	He	only	held	her	closer</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In	 the	 night,"	 went	 on	 Bubbles,	 "I	 was	 wondering	 if	 we'd	 be	 married	 in	 that strange	old	church	near	here,	our	church,	the	church	with	the	animals.	And	then	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought	no,	we	wouldn't	do	that,	for	I	am	not	likely	to	want	ever	to	come	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">here	again.	So	we'll	be	married	in	London,	in	a	City	church,	in	the	church	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">John	Gilpin	and	his	family	went	to	what	I	suppose	they	called	'worship.'	It's	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	will	have	to	say	you	worship	me,	Bill!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 lifted	 her	 head,	 and	 looked	 into	 his	 face.	 "Oh,	 Bill,"	 she	 said,	 her	 voice trembling	a	little,	"you	do	look	happy!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	am	happy,	but	I—I	can't	quite	believe	it,"	he	said	slowly;	"it's	too	good	to	be true." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 hope	 you'll	 go	 on	 being	 happy,"	 she	 said,	 again	 pressing	 closer	 to	 him.	 "But you	 know	 that	 sometimes,	 Bill—well,	 I	  <i class="calibre4">shall</i>	 dine	 at	 Edmonton	 while	 you	 do dine	at	Ware.	It's	no	good	my	trying	to	conceal	that	from	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I—I	 don't	 understand,"	 he	 stammered	 out.	 What	 did	 Bubbles	 mean	 by	 saying that? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You'll	know	soon	enough,"	she	said,	with	that	little	wise	look	of	hers—the	little look	he	loved.	"But	whenever	I'm	naughty	or	unreasonable,	or,	or	selfish,	Bill—</p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm	afraid	I	shall	often	be	 <i class="calibre4">very</i>	selfish—then	you	must	just	turn	to	me,	and	say:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p163"></a>'You	 know,	 Bubbles,	 when	 all's	 said	 and	 done,	 you're	 my	 Serf;	 but	 for	 me	 you wouldn't	be	here.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bill	Donnington	looked	at	her,	and	then	he	said	solemnly	and	very	deliberately:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	feel	that	you	ought	to	marry	me	out	of	gratitude,	Bubbles." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	took	her	hands	off	his	shoulders,	and	clapped	them	gleefully.	"I	was	waiting</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	that,	too!"	she	exclaimed.	"I	wonder	you	didn't	say	it	at	once—I	quite	thought you	would." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	said	seriously:	"But	I	really	mean	it.	I	couldn't	bear	to	think	that	you	married me	just	because	I	dragged	you	out	of	the	water." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	really	marrying	you,	if	you	want	to	know,"	she	exclaimed,	"because	of	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tapster!	During	the	last	few	days—I	wonder	if	you've	noticed	it,	Bill?"	(he	had, </p>
<p class="calibre1">indeed)—"that	man	has	looked	at	me	as	if	I	was	 <i class="calibre4">his</i>	serf—that's	a	polite	way	of putting	it—and	I	don't	like	it.	But	I've	got	a	friend—you	know	Phyllis	Burley?	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">think	she'd	do	for	him	exactly!	It	would	be	so	nice,	too,	for	she's	devoted	to	me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	we	should	have	the	use	of	one	of	their	motors	whenever	we	felt	like	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bill	 shook	 his	 head	 decidedly.	 "We	 never	 should	 feel	 like	 it,"	 he	 said;	 "even	 if Phyllis	did	marry	Mr.	Tapster,	which	I	greatly	doubt	she'd	even	think	of	doing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	going	to	tell	him	to-day,"	she	went	on,	"that	he's	got	to	marry	her.	There's nothing	 indelicate	 about	 my	 saying	 that,	 because	 they've	 never	 met.	 But	 it'll work	in	his	brain,	you	see	if	it	doesn't,	like	yeast	in	new	bread!	Then	I'll	bring</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	together,	and	then,	and	then—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	 then,"	 said	 Bill	 deliberately,	 "you'll	 never,	 with	 my	 goodwill,	 see	 him again.	So	find	him	a	wife	whom	you	don't	like,	Bubbles." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 looked	 at	 him	 meditatively.	 "Very	 well,"	 she	 said.	 "That	 will	 be	 my	 first sacrifice	for	you,	Bill.	I'll	save	him	up	for	Violet	Purton.	She's	a	horrid	girl—and</p>
<p class="calibre1">won't	she	make	his	money	fly!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	smiling	at	her	rather	oddly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bill!"	she	exclaimed,	startled.	"Bill!	I	do	believe	you're	going	to	be	master—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	she	flung	her	arms	again	round	his	neck.	"Kiss	me,"	she	commanded, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"kiss	me,	Bill.	And	then	you	must	go	away,	for	it	isn't	proper	that	you	should	be here,	at	this	time	of	the	morning,	now	that	we're	engaged!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p164"></a>
<a id="p165"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	XIX</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">That	same	morning,	but	a	good	deal	later,	Blanche	Farrow	woke	with	a	start	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">find	Pegler	standing	at	her	bedside	with	just	one	letter	in	her	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pegler	 was	 smiling.	 It	 was	 not	 a	 real	 smile,	 but	 just	 a	 general	 softening	 of	 her plain,	severe	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pegler	 knew	 that	 her	 lady	 had	 been	 rather	 "put	 out"	 at	 not	 having	 received	 her usual	 Christmas	 letter	 from	 Mr.	 Mark	 Gifford.	 She	 had	 spoken	 of	 it	 twice	 to Pegler,	once	lightly,	on	December	27,	and	then	again,	in	a	rather	upset	way,	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	29th.	After	that	she	had	pretended	to	forget	all	about	it.	But	Pegler	felt	sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Farrow	did	remember—often.	And	now	here	was	the	letter—a	much	fatter</p>
<p class="calibre1">letter	than	usual,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pegler,	of	course,	said	nothing.	It	was	not	her	place	to	know	the	hand-writing	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	of	the	gentlemen	who	wrote	to	her	mistress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Farrow	took	the	letter,	and	there	came	a	faint,	a	very	faint,	flush	over	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">face.	She	said:	"I	hope	Miss	Bubbles	has	had	a	good	night.	Have	you	been	in	to</p>

<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	 ma'am.	 She	 looks	 rather	 excited-like.	 But	 as	 you	 know,	 ma'am,	 that's	 a good	sign	with	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	I	think	it	is,	Pegler." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pegler	 slipped	 noiselessly	 away,	 and	 then	 Blanche	 opened	 the	 envelope</p>

<p class="calibre1">"Home	Office,	"  <i class="calibre4">December	23rd</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"MY	DEAR	BLANCHE, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'How	 use	 doth	 breed	 a	 habit	 in	 a	 man!'	 Well	 anyhow,	 as	 you	 know,	 it	 is	 my custom,	 which	 has	 now	 attained	 the	 dignity	 of	 a	 habit,	 always	 to	 write	 you	 a letter	for	Christmas.	Hitherto	I	have	always	known	where	it	would	find	you,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	year	is	an	exception,	for	I	really	have	no	idea	where	you	are. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a>"This	year	is	an	exception	in	another	respect	also.	Hitherto,	my	dear	Blanche,	I have,	with	a	tact	which	I	hope	you	have	silently	appreciated,	always	managed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">keep	 out	 of	 my	 Christmas	 letter	 any	 reference	 to	 what	 you	 know	 I	 have	 never given	up	hoping	for	even	against	hope.	But	this	time	I	can't	keep	it	out	because	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 had	 a	 really	 good	 idea.	 Even	 a	 Civil	 Servant	 may	 have	 a	 good	 idea</p>
<p class="calibre1">sometimes,	 and	 I	 assure	 you	 that	 this	 came	 to	 me	 out	 of	 office	 hours—as	 a matter	 of	 fact	 it	 came	 to	 me	 when	 I	 was	 sitting	 in	 that	 funny	 little	 old Westminster	churchyard	where	we	once	spent	what	was,	to	me,	the	happiest	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">half-hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	know	you	have	thought	me	unsympathetic	and	disapproving	about	that	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">holds	for	you	so	great	a	fascination.	Disapproving,	yes;	I	can't	help	disapproving</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 gambling,	 especially	 in	 a	 woman;	 but	 unsympathetic,	 no—a	 thousand	 times</p>
<p class="calibre1">no.	Sympathy	is	understanding,	and,	believe	me,	I	do	understand,	and	therefore	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">propose	this	plan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	you	will	do	me	the	honour	of	marrying	me,	I	propose	that	once	or	even	twice</p>
<p class="calibre1">every	year	you	should	go	off	to	Monte	Carlo,	or	wherever	else	you	like,	and	play</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 your	 heart's	 content.	 I	 promise	 never	 to	 reproach	 you,	 above	 all	 never	 to administer	those	silent	reproaches	which	I	think	are	always	the	hardest	to	bear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes,	I	will	always	play	the	game,	I	pledge	myself	to	that	most	faithfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Forgive	me	for	referring	to	something	which	makes	my	plan	easier	to	carry	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 year	 two	 accidents,	 the	 death	 of	 one	 colleague,	 and	 the	 premature</p>
<p class="calibre1">retirement	 of	 another,	 have	 pushed	 me	 up	 the	 ladder	 of	 promotion,	 and,	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">addition,	there	has	been	a	legacy.	The	English	of	that	is	that	for	our	joint	 <i class="calibre4">ménage</i> we	shouldn't	want	your	income	at	all;	we	could	quite	well	do	without	it,	and	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	be	perfectly	free	to	use	it	in	whatever	way	you	like. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There!	 That	 is	 my	 plan.	 Now,	 dearest	 of	 women,	 say	 yes	 and	 make	 us	 both happy,	for	you	would	make	me	so	happy	that	I	couldn't	help	making	you	happy</p>
<p class="calibre1">too.	I	wish	I	had	any	idea	where	you	will	be	when	you	read	this	letter,	on	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">hangs	 all	 my	 hopes.	 Perhaps	 you	 will	 read	 it	 at	 Monte,	 out	 on	 the	 Corniche Road.	Don't	let	the	fact	that	you	have	been	lucky	at	play	make	 <i class="calibre4">me</i>	unlucky	in—</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	know	what! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yours	ever	(this	is	no	figure	of	speech), </p>

<p class="calibre1">Blanche	 Farrow	 sighed	 and	 smiled,	 as	 she	 deliberately	 read	 the	 long	 letter</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a>through	twice.	Somehow	it	warmed	her	heart;	and	yet	would	she	ever	be	able	to give	up	the	life	which	in	many	ways	suited	her	so	well?	If	she	married	Mark—</p>
<p class="calibre1">dear,	kind,	generous-hearted	Mark—various	friendships	which,	even	if	they	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 mean	 so	 much	 to	 her	 as	 they	 appeared	 to	 do,	 yet	 meant	 a	 good	 deal	 in	 her present	lonely	life,	would	certainly	have	to	be	given	up.	To	take	but	one	instance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	had	almost	been	an	instinct	with	her	to	keep	Lionel	Varick	and	Mark	Gifford</p>
<p class="calibre1">apart.	In	the	old	days	she	had	been	disagreeably	aware	of	how	absolutely	Gifford</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	always	disapproved	of	Varick,	and	of	Varick's	various	ways	of	trying,	often</p>
<p class="calibre1">successfully,	 to	 raise	 the	 wind.	 Of	 course,	 everything	 was	 now	 different	 with regard	 to	 this	 particular	 friend.	 Varick	 had	 become—by	 what	 anyone	 not	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">hypocrite	must	admit	had	been	a	fortunate	circumstance—a	respectable	member</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	society;	but,	even	so,	she	knew,	deep	in	her	heart,	that	he	and	the	man	whose</p>
<p class="calibre1">letter	she	held	in	her	hand	would	never	like	one	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	yet	she	was	tired—so	tired!--of	the	sort	of	life	she	led,	year	in	and	year	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 nerves	 were	 no	 longer	 what	 they	 had	 once	 been.	 For	 instance,	 the	 strange series	 of	 happenings	 that	 had	 just	 taken	 place	 here,	 at	 Wyndfell	 Hall,	 had thoroughly	 upset	 her;	 and	 as	 for	 the	 horrible	 thing	 that	 had	 occurred	 yesterday, she	 hadn't	 been	 able	 to	 sleep	 all	 night	 for	 thinking	 of	 it.	 Nothing	 that	 had	 ever happened	in	her	now	long	life	had	had	quite	the	effect	on	Blanche	Farrow	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles'	accident	had	had.	She	had	realized,	suddenly,	how	fond	she	was	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">girl—how	strong	in	all	of	us	is	the	call	of	the	blood!	As	she	had	stood	watching</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Panton's	untiring	efforts	to	restore	the	circulation	of	the	apparently	drowned</p>
<p class="calibre1">girl	there	had	gone	up	from	Blanche's	heart	a	wild,	instinctive	prayer	to	the	God</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	whom	she	did	not	believe,	to	spare	the	child. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps	just	because	she	had	not	broken	down	before,	she	felt	the	more	now	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	had	happened	in	the	way	of	the	strange,	the	sinister,	and	the	untoward	during</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	last	fortnight.	And	all	at	once,	after	reading	yet	again	right	through	the	quiet, </p>
<p class="calibre1">measured	 letter	 of	 her	 old	 friend	 and	 constant	 lover,	 Blanche	 Farrow	 suddenly burst	into	a	passion	of	tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	it	struck	her	as	funny,	as	even	absurd,	that	she	should	cry	like	this!	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">hadn't	 cried	 for	 years	 and	 years—in	 fact,	 she	 could	 hardly	 remember	 the	 day when	she	had	last	cried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	jumped	out	of	bed	and	put	on	her	dressing-gown,	for	it	was	very	cold,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">then	she	went	and	gazed	at	her	reflection	in	the	one	looking-glass	in	the	room.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	a	beautiful	old	Jacobean	mirror	fixed	over	the	dressing-table. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a>Heavens!	What	a	fright	she	looked!	Do	tears	always	have	that	disfiguring	effect on	 a	 woman?	 This	 must	 be	 a	 lesson	 to	 her.	 She	 dabbed	 her	 eyes	 with	 a	 wet handkerchief,	and	then	she	went	over	to	the	writing-table	and	sat	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 the	 first	 time	 in	 her	 life	 Blanche	 Farrow	 wrote	 Mark	 Gifford	 a	 really grateful,	sincere	letter.	She	said,	truly,	how	touched	she	was	by	his	long	devotion</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	by	all	his	goodness	to	her.	She	admitted,	humbly,	that	she	wished	she	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">worthy	of	it	all.	But	she	finally	added	that	she	feared	she	could	never	find	it	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 heart	 and	 conscience	 to	 say	 that	 she	 would	 do	 what	 he	 wished.	 She	 had become	too	old,	too	set	in	her	ways.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet	it	was	with	a	heavy	heart	that	she	wrote	her	long	letter	in	answer	to	his,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 took	 her	 a	 long	 time,	 for	 she	 often	 waited	 a	 few	 moments	 in	 between	 the sentences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	strange	was	her	relationship	to	this	man	of	whom	she	saw	so	little,	and	yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	whom	she	felt	on	close,	intangible	terms	of	intimacy!	His	work	tied	him	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">London,	and	of	late	years	she	had	not	been	much	in	London.	He	knew	very	little</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	her	movements.	Why,	this	very	letter	had	been	sent	to	her,	care	of	her	London</p>
<p class="calibre1">club,	 the	 club	 which	 had	 its	 uses—principally—when	 she	 wanted	 to	 entertain</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mark	Gifford	himself	to	lunch	or	dinner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 letter	 had	 wandered	 to	 yet	 another	 address—an	 address	 she	 had	 left	 at	 the club	weeks	ago,	the	only	address	they	had.	From	thence	it	had	reached	the	last</p>
<p class="calibre1">house	 where	 she	 had	 been	 staying	 before	 she	 had	 come	 to	 Wyndfell	 Hall.	 The wonderful	thing	was	that	the	letter	had	reached	her	at	all.	But	she	was	very	glad</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	had	come,	if	only	at	long	last. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 her	 letter	 was	 finished,	 she	 suddenly	 felt	 that	 she	 must	 put	 in	 a	 word	 to account	for	the	delay	in	her	answer	to	what	should	have	received	an	immediate</p>
<p class="calibre1">reply.	 And	 so	 she	 added	 a	 postscript,	 which,	 unlike	 most	 women's	 postscripts, was	of	really	very	little	importance—or	so	the	writer	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	unimportant	postscript	ran:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your	 letter	 had	 followed	 me	 round	 to	 about	 half-a-dozen	 places.	 Bubbles Dunster	 and	 I	 have	 been	 spending	 Christmas	 in	 this	 wonderful	 old	 house, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wyndfell	 Hall,	 our	 host	 being	 Lionel	 Varick.	 He	 struck	 oil	 in	 the	 shape	 of	 an heiress	two	years	ago.	She	died	last	year;	and	he	has	become	a	most	respectable</p>
<p class="calibre1">member	of	society.	I	know	you	didn't	much	like	him,	though	he's	often	spoken	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	very	gratefully	of	the	good	turn	you	did	him	years	ago." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p169"></a>Blanche	hesitated,	pen	in	hand.	Of	course,	it	was	not	necessary	that	she	should mention	the	name	of	her	host.	She	might	rewrite	the	last	page	of	her	letter,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">leave	the	postscript	out.	It	was	unfortunately	true	that	Mark	had	taken	a	violent</p>
<p class="calibre1">prejudice	 against	 the	 man	 he	 had	 befriended	 to	 such	 good	 purpose	 years	 and years	ago.	She	had	been	still	young	then—young	and,	as	she	was	quite	willing	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">admit	now,	very	foolish.	In	fact,	she	looked	back	to	the	Blanche	Farrow	of	those</p>
<p class="calibre1">days,	 as	 we	 are	 sometimes	 apt	 to	 look	 back	 at	 our	 younger	 selves,	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">amazement	 and	 disapproval,	 rather	 than	 sympathy.	 But	 there	 was	 a	 streak	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">valiant	honesty	in	her	nature.	She	let	what	had	been	written	stand,	only	adding</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	words:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 party	 is	 breaking	 up	 to-morrow;	 but	 Bubbles,	 who	 had	 a	 disagreeable accident	 yesterday,	 will	 stay	 on	 here	 for	 a	 few	 days	 with	 me.	 All	 the	 same,	 I expect	we	shall	be	in	London	by	the	ninth;	and	then,	perhaps,	you	and	I	might</p>
<p class="calibre1">meet." </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 by	 Bubbles'	 special	 wish—nay,	 command,	 that	 her	 engagement	 to	 Bill</p>
<p class="calibre1">Donnington	was	publicly	announced	that	very	morning,	at	breakfast,	by	her	aunt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	was	much	interested,	and	said	the	usual	good-natured,	rather	silly,	civil</p>
<p class="calibre1">things;	 hence	 Blanche	 was	 glad	 Bill	 Donnington	 had	 breakfasted	 early,	 and	 so was	not	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	Brabazon	was	extremely	excited	and	delighted	at	the	news.	"I	suppose	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened	yesterday	morning!"	she	exclaimed.	"For,	of	course,	they	haven't	seen one	 another	 alone	 since	 then.	 If	 they	 were	 already	 engaged,	 what	 awful	 agony poor	Mr.	Donnington	must	have	gone	through	while	you	were	trying	to	bring	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	life	again?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 turned	 to	 Panton,	 and	 he	 answered	 thoughtfully,	 "I	 could	 see	 he	 was	 most terribly	 upset.	 Don't	 you	 remember	 how	 he	 refused	 to	 go	 up	 to	 the	 house	 and change	his	wet	clothes?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	couldn't	help	glancing	furtively	from	behind	the	teapot	and	high	silver</p>
<p class="calibre1">urn	at	James	Tapster.	His	phlegmatic	face	had	become	very	red.	Almost	at	once</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	had	got	up	and	gone	over	to	the	dresser,	and	there,	taking	a	long	time	about	it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 had	 cut	 himself	 some	 slices	 of	 ham.	 She	 noticed,	 with	 relief,	 that	 he	 came back	with	a	huge	plateful,	which	he	proceeded	to	eat	with	apparent	appetite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	when	is	the	wedding	to	take	place?"	asked	Helen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Almost	 at	 once,"	 replied	 Blanche	 smiling.	 "Bubbles	 never	 does	 anything	 like</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p170"></a>anybody	else!	She's	set	her	heart	on	going	to	town	the	very	moment	Dr.	Panton allows	her	to	get	up.	Then	they're	to	be	married	without	any	fuss	at	all	in	one	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	old	City	churches." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	 a	 splendid	 idea!"	 cried	 Helen.	 "That's	 just	 how	  <i class="calibre4">I</i>	 should	 like	 to	 be married." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I,	 too,"	 said	 Sir	 Lyon,	 in	 his	 pleasant	 voice.	 "To	 me	 there's	 always	 been something	barbaric	in	the	ordinary	grand	wedding." </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 Blanche	 Farrow	 shook	 her	 head.	 "Perhaps	 because	 I'm	 so	 much	 older	 than all	of	you,"	she	said	good-humouredly,	"I	think	there's	a	great	deal	to	be	said	for an	old-fashioned	wedding:	white	dress	(white	satin	for	choice),	orange	blossoms, </p>
<p class="calibre1">St.	 George's,	 Hanover	 Square,	 and	 all!	 I	 even	 like	 the	 crowd	 of	 people	 saying kind	 and	 unkind	 things	 in	 whispers	 to	 one	 another.	 I	 don't	 think	 I	 should	  <i class="calibre4">feel</i> myself	married	unless	I	went	through	all	that—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then,	 at	 last,	 James	 Tapster	 said	 something.	 "Marriage	 is	 all	 rot!"	 he	 said, speaking,	as	was	his	unpleasant	custom,	with	his	mouth	full.	"There	are	very	few</p>
<p class="calibre1">happy	married	couples	about." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That	 may	 be	 your	 experience,"	 said	 Varick,	 speaking	 for	 the	 first	 time	 since Blanche	had	told	the	great	news.	"I'm	glad	to	say	it	isn't	mine.	I	think	marriage far	the	happiest	state—for	either	a	man	or	a	woman." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	spoke	with	a	good	deal	of	feeling,	and	both	Panton	and	Helen	Brabazon	felt</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	much	touched.	He	had	certainly	made	 <i class="calibre4">his</i>	marriage	a	success. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile,	 Blanche	 suspected	 that	 Dr.	 Panton	 had	 just	 had	 a	 letter	 containing disturbing	 news.	 She	 saw	 him	 read	 it	 twice	 over.	 Then	 he	 put	 it	 carefully	 in	 a note-book	he	took	out	of	his	pocket.	"I	shall	have	to	go	to-morrow,	a	day	earlier than	 I	 thought,"	 he	 observed.	 "I've	 got	 an	 appointment	 in	 town	 on	 Thursday morning." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 Mr.	 Tapster	 announced	 that	  <i class="calibre4">he</i>	 was	 going	 to-day,	 and	 though	 Varick seemed	genuinely	sorry,	everyone	else	was	secretly	glad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 are	 days	 in	 life	 which	 pass	 by	 without	 being	 distinguished	 by	 any</p>
<p class="calibre1">outstanding	happenings,	and	which	yet	remain	in	the	mind	as	milestones	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">road	of	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such	 a	 day,	 at	 any	 rate	 to	 Blanche	 Farrow,	 was	 the	 day	 which	 saw	 the	 first</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p171"></a>disruption	of	Lionel	Varick's	Christmas	house	party.	Though	Mr.	Tapster	was	the only	guest	actually	to	leave	Wyndfell	Hall,	all	the	arrangements	concerning	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">departures	of	the	morrow	had	to	be	made.	Miss	Burnaby,	Helen	Brabazon,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	Lyon	Dilsford	were	to	travel	together.	Dr.	Panton	was	going	by	a	later	train, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 was	 also	 Bill	 Donnington.	 Blanche	 herself,	 with	 of	 course	 Bubbles,	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaving	on	the	Saturday. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 the	 day	 went	 on	 Blanche	 realized	 that	 Varick	 much	 desired	 that	 Helen</p>
<p class="calibre1">Brabazon	should	also	stay	on	till	Saturday.	But	she,	Blanche,	thought	this	desire</p>
<p class="calibre1">unreasonable.	Though	she	had	come	to	like	her,	she	found	the	good,	thoughtful, </p>
<p class="calibre1">conscientious,	 and	 yet	 simple-minded	 Helen	 "heavy	 in	 hand";	 she	 told	 herself that	if	Helen	stayed	on,	the	entertaining	of	the	girl	would	fall	on	her,	especially</p>
<p class="calibre1">if,	as	Dr.	Panton	insisted,	Bubbles	must	not	get	up	till	Friday	at	dinner-time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking	back,	Blanche	Farrow	told	herself	that	that	day	had	been	full	of	curious</p>
<p class="calibre1">premonitions.	Yet	it	had	opened,	in	a	sense	happily	for	her,	with	the	coming	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mark	Gifford's	quaint,	characteristic	letter.	Then	had	come	the	shock,	and	it	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 a	 shock,	 of	 Bubbles'	 engagement,	 and	 of	 the	 girl's	 insistence	 on	 its	 being announced	to	the	rest	of	the	house	party	at	once—at	breakfast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 only	 outstanding	 thing	 which	 happened,	 and	 it	 was	 indeed	 a	 small	 thing compared	 to	 the	 other	 two,	 was	 the	 departure	 of	 James	 Tapster.	 Blanche	 felt sorry	 for	 him—genuinely	 sorry.	 But	 she	 philosophically	 told	 herself	 that	 no</p>
<p class="calibre1">amount	 of	 money,	 even	 had	 Bill	 Donnington	 never	 existed,	 could	 have	 made</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	even	tolerably	happy	tied	to	such	a	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 Mr.	 Tapster	 had	 gone	 they	 all	 breathed	 the	 more	 freely.	 Yet	 Blanche</p>
<p class="calibre1">somehow	 did	 not	 feel	 comfortable.	 What	 was	 wrong,	 for	 instance,	 with	 Lionel Varick?	He	looked	ill	at	ease,	as	well	as	ill	physically.	Something	seemed	also	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 weighing	 on	 Dr.	 Panton's	 mind.	 Even	 Sir	 Lyon	 Dilsford	 was	 unlike	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleasant	easy	self.	But	Blanche	thought	she	knew	what	ailed	 <i class="calibre4">him</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 only	 sheet	 anchor	 of	 comfort	 during	 that	 long,	 dull	 afternoon	 and	 evening was	 the	 thought	 that	 Bubbles'	 life	 was	 set	 on	 the	 right	 lines	 at	 last	 ...	 and	 that Mark	Gifford	had	not	changed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p172"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	XX</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">"HONBLE.	 BLANCHE	 FARROW—Wyndfell	 Hall—Darnaston—Suffolk—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Very	private—Meet	me	outside	Darnaston	Church	at	twelve	o'clock,	midday,	to-</p>
<p class="calibre1">morrow,	Wednesday—MARK	GIFFORD." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	sat	up	in	bed	and	stared	down	at	the	telegraph	form.	What	on	earth	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	mean?	But	for	the	fact	that	she	knew	it	to	be	out	of	the	question,	she	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	suspected	a	foolish	and	vulgar	practical	joke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	noted	that	the	telegram	had	been	sent	off	at	9.30	the	night	before	(just	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mark	must	have	received	her	letter).	She	also	saw	that	it	had	been	inscribed	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">morning	delivery.	That	was	like	Mark	Gifford.	He	was	nothing	if	not	careful	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">precise	with	regard	to	everything	of	a	business	kind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 she	 began	 asking	 herself	 the	 sort	 of	 rather	 futile	 questions	 people	 do	 ask themselves,	 when	 puzzled,	 and	 made	 uneasy	 by	 what	 seems	 an	 inexplicable</p>
<p class="calibre1">occurrence.	How	would	Mark	get	to	Darnaston	by	twelve	o'clock	to-day?	Surely</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	could	only	do	so	by	starting	before	it	was	light,	and	motoring	the	whole	way</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	London? </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 gazed	 at	 the	 words	 "very	 private."	 What	 did	 they	 portend?	 Quickly	 she examined	her	conscience.	No,	she	had	done	nothing—nothing	which	could	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">brought	 her	 into	 contact,	 even	 slightly,	 with	 the	 law.	 Of	 course,	 she	 was	 well aware	 that	 Mark	 had	 never	 forgotten,	 even	 over	 all	 these	 years,	 the	 dreadful scrape	into	which	she	had	got	herself	by	going	to	those	gambling	parties	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleasant,	 quiet,	 Jermyn	 Street	 flat	 where	 she	 and	 Varick	 had	 first	 become</p>
<p class="calibre1">acquainted.	But	that	had	been	a	sharp	lesson,	and	one	by	which	she	had	profited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	next	took	a	rapid	mental	survey	of	her	family,	all	so	much	more	respectable</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	prosperous	than	herself.	The	only	person	among	them	capable	of	getting	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	real	scrape	was	poor	little	Bubbles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bubbles	was	now	practically	well	again.	She	had	written	out	the	announcement</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	was	to	appear	in	the	 <i class="calibre4">Times</i>	and	the	 <i class="calibre4">Morning	Post</i>,	and	had	insisted	on	its being	sent	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Donnington	 had	 been	 somewhat	 perturbed	 by	 the	 thought	 of	 their	 engagement</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p173"></a>being	 thus	 at	 once	 made	 public.	 But	 Bubbles	 had	 observed	 cheerfully:	 "Once people	know	about	it,	I	shan't	be	able	to	get	out	of	it,	even	if	I	want	to!"	To	that Bill	 had	 said,	 sorely,	 that	 if	 she	 wanted	 to	 give	 him	 the	 chuck	 she	 should	 of course	do	so,	even	on	the	altar	steps.	Bubbles	had	laughed	at	that	and	exclaimed:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 only	 said	 it	 to	 tease	 you,	 old	 thing!	 The	 real	 truth	 is	 that	 I	 want	 father	 to understand	 that	 I	 really	 mean	 it—that's	 all.	 He	 reads	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Times</i>	 right	 through every	 day,	 and	 he'll	 think	 it	 true	 if	 he	 sees	 it	 there.	 As	 for	 his	 tiresome	 widow, she'll	see	it	in	the	 <i class="calibre4">Morning	Post</i>—and	then	she'll	believe	it,	too!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	 Farrow	 told	 herself	 that	 this	 mysterious	 and	 extraordinary	 message</p>
<p class="calibre1">might	 have	 something	 to	 do	 with	 Bubbles;	 and	 as	 she	 got	 up,	 she	 went	 on</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinking	with	increasing	unease	of	the	unexpected	assignation	which	lay	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	a	comfort	to	feel	that	that	disagreeable	man,	James	Tapster,	was	gone,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	the	rest	of	the	party,	with	the	exception	of	herself	and	Bubbles,	were	going</p>
<p class="calibre1">to-day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	 had	 again	 been	 said	 about	 Miss	 Burnaby	 and	 her	 niece	 staying	 on, and	she	had	heard	Varick	pressing	them	earnestly	to	do	so;	but	the	old	lady	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	unwilling	to	break	her	plan,	the	more	so	that	she	had	an	appointment	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 dentist.	 Then	 Varick	 had	 asked	 why	 Miss	 Brabazon	 shouldn't	 stay	 on	 till Saturday?	 There	 had	 been	 a	 considerable	 discussion	 about	 it;	 but	 Blanche</p>
<p class="calibre1">secretly	 hoped	 they	 would	 all	 go	 away.	 She	 felt	 tired	 and	 unlike	 herself.	 The events	of	the	last	few	days	had	shaken	her	badly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	an	extraordinary	difference	a	few	moments	can	make	in	one's	outlook	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">life!	Blanche	Farrow	was	uncomfortably	aware	that	she	would	never	forget	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	happened	to	her	on	New	Year's	Eve.	That	strange	and	fearful	experience	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">obliterated	some	of	her	clearest	mental	landmarks.	She	wished	to	think,	she	tried</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	 hard	 to	 think,	 that	 in	 some	 mysterious	 way	 the	 vision	 she	 had	 seen	 with such	 terrible	 distinctness	 had	 been	 a	 projection	 from	 Bubbles'	 brain—Bubbles' </p>
<p class="calibre1">uncanny	 gift	 working,	 perchance,	 on	 Lionel	 Varick's	 mind	 and	 memory.	 She</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 not	 doubt	 that	 the	 two	 wraiths	 she	 had	 seen	 so	 clearly	 purported	 to	 be	 a survival	 of	 the	 human	 personalities	 of	 the	 two	 women	 who	 each	 had	 borne</p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick's	name,	and	had	been,	for	a	while,	so	closely	linked	with	him.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet	 long	 ago,	 when	 quite	 a	 young	 woman,	 she	 had	 come	 to	 the	 deliberate</p>
<p class="calibre1">conclusion	that	there	was	no	such	survival	of	human	personality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking	 up	 Mark	 Gifford's	 mysterious	 telegram,	 and	 one	 or	 two	 unimportant</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p174"></a>letters	 she	 had	 just	 received,	 she	 went	 downstairs,	 to	 see,	 as	 she	 came	 into	 the dining-room,	that	only	Varick	was	already	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	up,	and	she	was	shocked	to	see	how	ill	and	strained	he	looked.	He	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">taken	 poor	 little	 Bubbles'	 accident	 terribly	 to	 heart;	 Blanche	 knew	 he	 had	 a feeling—which	 was	 rather	 absurd,	 after	 all,—that	 he	 in	 some	 way	 could	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">prevented	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	as	he	saw	her	come	in	his	face	lightened,	and	she	felt	touched.	Poor	Lionel! </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	certainly	very,	very	fond	of	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	do	hope	Helen	Brabazon	will	stay	on	with	you	and	Bubbles,"	he	said	eagerly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	think	I've	nearly	persuaded	Miss	Burnaby	to	let	her	do	so.	Do	say	a	word	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">her,	Blanche?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 will,	 if	 you	 like.	 But	 in	 that	 case,	 hadn't	 we	 better	 ask	 Sir	 Lyon	 to	 stay	 on, too?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Dilsford!"	he	exclaimed.	"Why	on	earth	should	we	think	of	doing	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	smiled.	"Where	are	your	eyes?"	she	asked.	"Sir	Lyon's	head	over	heels in	 love	 with	 Helen	 Brabazon;	 and	 I've	 been	 wondering	 these	 last	 few	 days</p>
<p class="calibre1">whether	 that	 quiet,	 demure	 girl	 is	 quite	 as	 unconscious	 of	 his	 state	 as	 she pretends	to	be!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then,	 as	 she	 began	 pouring	 out	 a	 cup	 of	 tea	 for	 the	 man	 who	 was	 now looking	 at	 her	 with	 a	 dismayed,	 surprised	 expression	 on	 his	 face,	 she	 went	 on composedly:	"It	would	be	rather	amusing	if	two	engagements	were	to	come	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	your	house-party,	Lionel—wouldn't	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	he	answered	at	once,	in	a	harsh,	decided	tone,	"I	think	you're	quite	mistaken, Blanche.	Why,	they've	hardly	exchanged	two	words	together." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	 put	 down	 the	 tea-pot.	 She	 began	 to	 laugh—she	 really	 couldn't	 help	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	 must	 have	 been	 deaf	 as	 well	 as	 blind!"	 she	 exclaimed.	 "They've	 been together	perpetually!	I	admit	that	that's	been	his	doing—not	hers.	For	days	past</p>
<p class="calibre1">I've	 seen	 right	 into	 his	 mind—seen,	 I	 mean,	 the	 struggle	 that	 has	 been	 taking place	between	his	pride	and—yes,	the	extraordinary	attraction	that	girl	seems	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 for	 him.	 He's	 no	 fortune-hunter,	 you	 know;	 also,	 he	 wants	 so	 little,	 the lucky	man,	that	I	think	her	money	would	be	a	positive	bother	to	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lionel	 Varick	 stared	 at	 Blanche	 Farrow.	 She	 had	 a	 way	 of	 being	 right	 about</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p175"></a>worldly	matters—the	triumph	of	experience	over	hope,	as	she	had	once	observed cynically.	But	this	time	he	felt	sure	she	was	wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 feminine	 interest	 in	 a	 possible,	 probable,	 or	 even	 improbable	 love-affair always	 surprises	 the	 average	 man—surprises,	 and	 sometimes	 annoys	 him	 very</p>
<p class="calibre1">much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	you	go	so	far	as	to	say	she	returns	this—this	feeling	you	attribute	to	him?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	asked	abruptly.	He	was	relieved	to	see	Blanche	shake	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No;	I	can't	say	that	I've	detected	any	response	on	her	part,"	she	said	lightly.	"But she's	very	old-fashioned	and	reserved.	She	certainly	enjoys	Sir	Lyon's	rather	dull</p>
<p class="calibre1">conversation,	and	she	likes	cross-examining	him	about	the	life	of	the	poor.	She's</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	very	good	girl,"	went	on	Blanche	musingly.	"She's	a	tremendous	sense	of	duty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	can	never	tell—but	no,	I	don't	think	the	idea	that	Sir	Lyon's	in	love	with	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">has	 yet	 crossed	 her	 mind!	 And	 I	 should	 say	 that	 she	 really	 prefers	 you	 to	 him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	has	a	tremendous	opinion	of	you,	Lionel.	I	wonder	why?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	laughed	aloud,	for	the	first	time	since	Bubbles'	accident.	He	knew	that	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	said	was	true,	and	it	was	a	very	pleasant,	reassuring	bit	of	knowledge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Old	Burnaby	would	not	think	of	allowing	her	to	marry	a	penniless	baronet,"	he said	smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	looked	across	at	him	quickly.	"Good	and	obedient	as	she	is	to	both	those</p>
<p class="calibre1">old	 things,	 I	 don't	 think	 they'd	 be	 able	 to	 influence	 Helen	 Brabazon	 in	 such	 a thing	as	marriage." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	you	may	be	right,"	said	Varick,	doubtfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	felt	strongly	tempted	to	take	Blanche	into	his	confidence;	to	tell	her,	frankly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 he	 wished	 to	 marry	 Helen.	 Yet	 some	 obscure	 instinct	 held	 him	 back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Women,	even	the	most	sensible	women,	are	so	damned	sentimental!	So	he	told</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself.	 Lately	 he	 had	 had	 the	 unpleasant,	 disconcerting	 feeling	 that	 whenever Helen	looked	at	him	she	thought	of	"poor	Milly." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Still,	 I	 don't	 envy	 Sir	 Lyon	 his	 wooing,"	 went	 on	 Blanche.	 "Helen	 is	 a	 girl who'll	take	a	long	time	to	make	up	her	mind,	and	who	will	weigh	all	the	pros	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">cons." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	you	don't	think,"	said	Varick	in	a	low	tone,	"that	she	would	ever	be	swept off	her	feet?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p176"></a>At	one	time	he	had	felt	sure	she	would	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"By	a	grand	passion?	My	dear	Lionel,	what	an	absurd	idea!	But	hush—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 door	 opened,	 and	 the	 object	 of	 their	 discussion	 came	 in.	 Helen	 Brabazon always	looked	especially	well	as	breakfast.	It	was	her	hour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How's	Bubbles	this	morning?"	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	Blanche	felt	rather	guilty.	She	hadn't	been	into	Bubbles'	room;	her	mind	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 too	 full	 of	 other	 things.	 "She's	 going	 on	 very	 well,"	 she	 answered composedly.	"I	think	she	might	get	up	to-morrow,	in	spite	of	Dr.	Panton."	And then,	for	she	felt	Varick	was	"willing"	her	to	say	it:	"I	do	hope	that	you	are	going to	stay	on	till	Saturday,	even	if	your	aunt	has	to	go	away	this	afternoon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,"	 said	 Helen,	 and	 the	 colour	 deepened	 a	 little	 in	 her	 cheeks.	 "Yes,	 I've persuaded	Auntie	to	let	me	stay	on	till	you	and	Bubbles	come	up	to	London.	It's</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	two	days,	after	all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	  <i class="calibre4">am</i>	 glad."	 There	 was	 a	 genuine	 thrill	 of	 satisfaction	 in	 Varick's	 voice.	 This meant	that	he	and	the	girl	would	be	practically	alone	together	all	to-morrow	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Friday. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 think	 Sir	 Lyon	 could	 manage	 to	 stay	 on	 too,	 if	 you	 ask	 him."	 Helen	 smiled guilelessly	at	her	host.	"I	saw	him	just	now.	He	and	Dr.	Panton	were	taking	Span</p>
<p class="calibre1">round	to	the	kitchen,	and	when	I	said	I	was	staying	on,	Sir	Lyon	said	he	thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	could	stay	on	too,	just	till	Saturday	morning." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	could	not	forbear	giving	a	covert	glance	of	triumph	at	Varick's	surprised</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	annoyed	face.	"Of	course,"	she	said	quickly,	"we	shall	be	delighted	to	have Sir	Lyon	a	little	longer.	I	thought	by	what	he	said	that	he	was	absolutely	obliged</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	go	away	to-day,	by	the	same	train	as	you	and	Miss	Burnaby." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	certainly	said	so,"	observed	Varick	coldly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then,	for	Blanche	Farrow	was	above	all	things	a	woman	of	the	world,	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	other	two	men	came	in	she	made	everything	quite	easy	for	Sir	Lyon,	pressing</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	to	stay	on,	as	if	she	had	only	just	thought	of	it.	But	she	noticed,	with	covert</p>
<p class="calibre1">amusement,	 that	 he	 was	 very	 unlike	 his	 usual	 cool,	 collected	 self.	 He	 actually looked	 sheepish—yes,	 that	 was	 the	 only	 word	 for	 it!	 Also,	 he	 made	 rather	 a favour	 of	 staying.	 "I	 shall	 have	 to	 telegraph,"	 he	 said;	 "for	 I'd	 made	 all	 my arrangements	to	go	back	this	afternoon." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p177"></a>"As	for	me,"	said	Dr.	Panton,	"I	must	leave	this	afternoon,	worse	luck!	But	there it	 is."	 He	 turned	 to	 Varick.	 "I've	 got	 an	 appointment	 in	 London	 to-morrow morning—one	I	can't	put	off." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Donnington	 came	 in	 at	 last.	 He	 looked	 radiant—indeed,	 his	 look	 of	 happiness was	in	curious	contrast	to	the	lowering	expression	which	now	clouded	Varick's</p>
<p class="calibre1">face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bubbles	 is	 nearly	 well	 again!"	 he	 cried	 joyfully.	 "She	 says	 she'll	 get	 up	 to-morrow,	doctor	or	no	doctor!"	He	looked	at	Panton;	then,	turning	to	Blanche,	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	lower	tone:	"Also,	she's	shown	me	the	most	wonderful	letter	from	her	father, </p>
<p class="calibre1">written	to	her	before	Christmas.	I	always	thought	he	disliked	me:	but	he	liked	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	very	first	time	we	met—isn't	that	strange?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Very	strange,"	said	Blanche,	smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 all	 scattered	 after	 breakfast,	 but	 Miss	 Farrow	 noticed	 that	 Varick	 made	 a determined	 and	 successful	 attempt	 to	 carry	 off	 Helen	 Brabazon	 from	 Sir	 Lyon, who	had	obviously	been	lying	in	wait	for	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	 dogs	 in	 the	 manger	 men	 are!"	 she	 said	 to	 herself.	 And	 then	 she remembered,	with	a	little	gasp	of	dismay,	her	mysterious	appointment	with	Mark</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gifford.	 She	 knew	 him	 well	 enough	 to	 be	 sure	 that	 he	 would	 be	 in	 good	 time; but,	even	so,	there	was	more	than	an	hour	to	be	got	through	somehow	before	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	start	for	Darnaston. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 went	 up	 to	 Bubbles'	 room.	 Yes,	 the	 girl	 looked	 marvellously	 better—</p>
<p class="calibre1">younger	too,	quite	different! </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	came	a	knock	at	the	door	while	she	was	there,	and	Donnington	came	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	you'd	been	wise,"	said	Bubbles,	looking	up	at	him,	"you'd	have	made	up	to Helen	Brabazon,	Bill.	She's	like	an	apple,	just	ready	to	fall	off	the	tree." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	 <i class="calibre4">do</i>	you	mean?"	asked	Blanche. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just	what	I	say.	She's	tremendously	in	love	with	love!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"D'you	really	think	so?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">(If	so,	Sir	Lyon's	task	would	be	an	easy	one.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 know	 it,"	 said	 Bubbles	 positively.	 "I've	 made	 a	 close	 study	 of	 that	 girl.	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p178"></a>confess	 I	 didn't	 like	 her	 at	 first,	 and	 I	 will	 tell	 you	 why,	 though	 I	 know	 it	 will shock	Bill." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've	 always	 liked	 Miss	 Brabazon,"	 he	 said	 stoutly,	 "why	 didn't	 you	 like	 her, Bubbles?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Because	when	she	arrived	here	I	saw	that	she	was	in	love	with	Lionel	Varick." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	talk	nonsense,"	said	her	aunt	reprovingly.	"You	know	I	don't	like	that	sort of	joking." </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	as	for	Bill,	he	turned	and	walked	towards	the	door.	"I've	got	some	letters	to write,"	he	said	crossly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	go	away,	Bill.	It	isn't	a	joke,	Blanche—and	I'm	going	really	to	shock	 <i class="calibre4">you</i> now—unless,	of	course,	you're	only	pretending	to	be	shocked?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	d'you	mean?"	said	Blanche. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	think	Helen	fell	in	love	with	Lionel	Varick	before	his	wife	died." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bill	 said	 sharply:	 "I	 won't	 have	 you	 say	 such	 disgusting	 things,	 Bubbles!"	 And he	did	indeed	look	disgusted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	a	queer	mind	you've	got,"	said	Bubbles	reprovingly.	"I	mean,	of	course,	in quite	a	proper	way;	that	is,	without	the	poor	girl	knowing	anything	about	it.	But	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing	 <i class="calibre4">he</i>	knew	it	right	enough." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	remained	silent.	Bubbles'	words	were	making	her	feel	curiously	uneasy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	threw	a	light	on	certain	things	which	had	puzzled	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lionel	 Varick	 marked	 her	 down	 long	 ago,"	 went	 on	 Bubbles	 slowly.	 "On	 the evening	that	she	arrived	I	saw	that	he	had	quite	made	up	his	mind	to	marry	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	as	the	days	went	on	I	began	to	hope	that	he	wouldn't	succeed."	She	uttered</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	last	words	very,	very	seriously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	aunt	looked	at	her,	surprised	at	the	feeling	she	threw	into	her	voice.	As	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Donnington,	he	was	staring	at	her	dumbly	and,	yes,	angrily.	At	last	he	said:	"And why	shouldn't	Varick	marry	her,	if	they	both	like	one	another?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	wouldn't	understand	if	I	were	to	tell	you.	You're	too	stupid	and	too	good	to understand." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Donnington	 felt	 very	 much	 put	 out.	 He	 did	 not	 mind	 being	 called	 stupid,	 but</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p179"></a>what	on	earth	did	Bubbles	mean	by	saying	he	was	too	good? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	sure	Lionel's	dead	wife	has	been	haunting	Helen,"	went	on	Bubbles	rapidly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"quite,	quite	sure	of	it.	And	I'm	glad	she	has!	I	should	be	sorry	for	any	nice	girl</p>
<p class="calibre1">—for	 any	 woman,	 even	 a	 horrid	 woman—to	 marry	 Lionel	 Varick.	 There!	 I've</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	my	say,	and	now	I	shall	for	ever	hold	my	peace." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 both	 stared	 at	 her,	 astonished	 by	 the	 passion	 and	 energy	 with	 which	 she uttered	the	curious	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bill	 looked	 down	 at	 the	 girl,	 and,	 though	 he	 felt	 hurt	 and	 angry	 with	 her,	 his heart	suddenly	softened.	Bubbles	looked	very	frail	and	tired	lying	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bill,"	she	said,	"come	here,"	and	he	came,	though	not	very	willingly,	closer	to her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	pulled	him	down.	"I	only	want	to	tell	you	that	I	love	you,"	she	whispered, and	his	anger,	his	irritation,	vanished	like	snow	in	the	sun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	was	already	at	the	door.	She	turned	round.	"Well,	I	must	be	off	now	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	 the	  <i class="calibre4">chef</i>,	 and	 to	 make	 all	 sorts	 of	 arrangements.	 Sir	 Lyon	 is	 staying	 on—</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather	unlike	him	to	change	his	mind,	but	he's	done	so—at	the	last	moment." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	wish	 <i class="calibre4">I</i>	could	get	a	few	more	days'	holiday,"	said	Bill	ruefully.	"My	number's up	this	afternoon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	letters	he	had	to	write	could	go	to	blazes—of	course	he	meant	to	spend	each</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	precious	minutes	that	remained	in	the	next	few	hours	with	Bubbles! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You'll	be	able	to	escort	old	Miss	Burnaby	to	town,	for	Helen's	staying	on,"	went on	Blanche. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Helen	 staying	 on?"	 exclaimed	 Bubbles.	 "I'm	 glad	 of	 that!	 Oh,	 and	 Sir	 Lyon's staying	on,	too?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	suddenly	gave	one	of	her	funny,	eerie	little	chuckles;	but	she	made	no	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">comment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,"	called	out	Blanche.	"And	Dr.	Panton's	going—so	I've	a	good	many	little things	to	see	to." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bill	sprang	to	the	door,	and	opened	it	for	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 it	 shut	 she	 heard	 Bubbles'	 voice,	 and	 it	 was	 a	 voice	 Blanche	 Farrow	 hardly</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p180"></a>knew.	"Are	you	really	sorry	you're	going	away	from	your	little	kid,	Bill?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	 sighed	 sharply.	 After	 all,	 so	 she	 told	 herself,	 there	 is	 something	 to	 be said	for	love's	young	dream. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p181"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	XXI</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 marked	 ten	 minutes	 to	 twelve	 on	 the	 tower	 of	 the	 ancient	 chantry	 church	 of Darnaston	as	Blanche	Farrow	walked	across	the	village	green	and	past	the	group</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 thatched	 cottages	 composing	 the	 pretty	 hamlet	 which	 looks	 so	 small</p>
<p class="calibre1">compared	with	its	noble	house	of	God.	But,	though	she	was	early,	the	man	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 to	 meet	 was	 evidently	 already	 there,	 for	 a	 big,	 mud-stained	 motor-car	 was drawn	up	in	the	lane	which	runs	to	the	left	of	the	church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feeling	more	and	more	apprehensive,	she	knew	not	of	what,	she	walked	up	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">path	 between	 the	 graves,	 and	 then	 suddenly	 she	 saw	 Mark	 Gifford—his	 spare, </p>
<p class="calibre1">still	 active-looking	 figure	 framed	 in	 the	 stone	 porch,	 his	 plain,	 but	 pleasant, intelligent-looking	face	full	of	a	grave	welcome. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stepped	out	of	the	porch	and	gripped	her	hand	in	silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	felt	that	he	was	deeply	stirred,	stirred	as	she	had	never	known	him	to	be—</p>
<p class="calibre1">excepting,	 perhaps,	 on	 that	 occasion,	 years	 and	 years	 ago,	 when	 he	 had	 first asked	her	to	be	his	wife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still	holding	her	hand	in	that	strong	grasp,	he	drew	her	within	the	porch.	"I'm	so grateful	 to	 you	 for	 having	 come,"	 he	 said.	 "I	 hope	 you	 didn't	 think	 what	 I	 did very	odd?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	did	think	it	just	a	little	odd." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	trying	to	smile—to	be	her	usual	composed	self. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 couldn't	 come	 to	 Wyndfell	 Hall,"	 he	 said	 abruptly,	 "for	 a	 reason	 which	 you will	 soon	 know.	 But	 I	 had	 to	 see	 you,	 and,	 by	 a	 bit	 of	 luck,	 I	 suddenly remembered	this	splendid	old	church.	I	passed	by	here	once	on	a	walking	tour, </p>
<p class="calibre1">years	and	years	ago.	It's	the	sort	of	place	people	come	a	long	way	to	see;	so,	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	are	found	here	together—well,	we	might	have	met	by	accident." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As	it	is,	we	have	met	by	appointment,"	she	said	quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	feeling	more	and	more	frightened.	Mark	now	looked	so	set,	so	grim. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p182"></a>"Would	you	rather	stay	out	here,"	he	asked,	"or	shall	we	go	into	the	church?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'd	rather	stay	out	here.	What	is	it,	Mark?	Don't	keep	me	in	suspense." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	standing,	facing	one	another;	he	had	let	go	her	hand	at	last. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	I've	come	to	tell	you	will	give	you,	I	fear,	a	great	shock,"	he	began	slowly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"for	it	concerns	someone	to	whom	I	believe	you	to	be	deeply	attached." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	away	from	her	for	the	first	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	it	 <i class="calibre4">is</i>	Bubbles!"	she	cried,	dismayed.	"What	on	earth	has	the	child	done?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 turned	 and	 again	 looked	 into	 her	 face,	 now	 full	 of	 a	 deeply	 troubled, </p>
<p class="calibre1">questioning	anxiety.	"Bubbles	Dunster?"	he	exclaimed.	"Good	heavens,	no!	It's nothing	to	do	with	Bubbles." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	look	of	uncontrollable	relief	came	over	her	eyes	and	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who	is	it,	Mark?	You	credit	me	with	a	warmer	heart	than	I	possess—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	he	remained	silent,	and	she	said	quickly:	"Come!	Who	is	it,	Mark?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can't	you	guess?"	he	asked	harshly.	And,	as	she	shook	her	head,	he	added,	in	a slow,	 reluctant	 tone:	 "I've	 always	 supposed	 you	 to	 be	 really	 attached	 to	 Lionel Varick." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lionel?	That	was	the	last	name	she	expected	to	hear! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	know	exactly	what	you	mean	by	'attached,'	Mark,"	she	said	coldly.	"But yes,	 I've	 always	 been	 fond	 of	 him—in	 a	 way	 I	 suppose	 you	 might	 call	 it</p>
<p class="calibre1">'attached'—since	that	horrid	affair,	years	ago,	when	you	were	so	kind	both	to	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	to	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't	couple	yourself	with	him,"	he	said	sternly,	"if,	as	I	gather,	you	don't	really care	for	him,	Blanche."	And	then,	almost	inaudibly,	he	added:	"You	don't	know the	tortures	of	jealousy	I've	suffered	at	the	thought	of	you	and	that	man." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tortures	of	jealousy?"	she	repeated,	astonished,	and	rather	touched.	"Oh,	Mark</p>
<p class="calibre1">—poor	 Mark!	 Why	 didn't	 you	 ask	 me?	 I've	 never,	 never	 cared	 for	 him	 in—in</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	sort	of	way.	How	could	you	think	I	did?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yet	 you're	 here,	 in	 his	 house,"	 he	 said,	 "acting	 (so	 you	 said	 in	 your	 letter)	 as hostess	 to	 his	 guests?	 And	 surely	 you've	 always	 been	 on	 terms	 of	 what	 most</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p183"></a>people	would	call	close	friendship	with	him?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	I	suppose	I	have"—she	hesitated—"in	a	way.	I've	always	felt	that,	like	me, he	hadn't	many	real	friends.	And,	of	course,	in	old	days,	ages	ago,	he	was	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">fond	of	me,"	she	smiled.	"That	always	pleases	a	woman,	Mark." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Does	it?"	he	asked,	probingly;	and	as	only	answer	she	reddened	slightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	came	a	little	pause,	and	then	Blanche	exclaimed:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	sorry,	very	sorry,	if	he's	got	into	a	new	scrape,	Mark;	and	I'm	surprised	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	 two	 years	 ago	 he	 married	 a	 rich	 woman;	 she	 died	 not	 long	 after	 their marriage,	but	she	was	devoted	to	him,	and	he's	quite	well	off	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did	you	know	her?"	asked	Mark	Gifford,	in	a	singular	tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,	 I	 never	 came	 across	 her.	 I	 was	 away—in	 Portugal,	 I	 think.	 He	 wrote	 and told	me	about	his	marriage,	and	then,	later,	when	his	wife	fell	ill,	he	wrote	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	extremely	good	to	her,	Mark." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"D'you	know	much	about	Varick's	early	life?"	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	think	I	know	all	there	is	to	know,"	she	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	was	Mark	getting	at?	What	had	Lionel	Varick	done?	Her	mind	was	already</p>
<p class="calibre1">busily	intent	on	the	thought	of	how	disagreeable	it	would	be	to	have	to	warn	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	impending	unpleasantness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	good	of	Mark	to	have	taken	all	this	trouble!	Of	course,	he	had	taken	it	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 sake,	 and	 she	 felt	 very	 grateful—and	 still	 a	 little	 frightened;	 he	 looked	 so unusually	grave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	 <i class="calibre4">do</i>	you	know	of	Varick's	early	life?"	he	persisted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	think	there's	very	much	to	know,"	she	answered	uneasily.	"His	father	had a	place	in	Yorkshire,	and	got	involved	in	some	foolish,	wild	speculations.	In	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">end	the	man	went	bankrupt,	everything	was	sold	up,	and	they	were	very	poor	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	while—horribly	poor,	I	believe.	Then	the	elder	Varick	died,	and	his	widow	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lionel	 went	 and	 lived	 at	 Bedford.	 I	 gather	 Lionel's	 mother	 was	 clever,	 proud, and	quarrelsome.	At	any	rate,	she	quarrelled	with	her	people,	and	he	had	a	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">lonely	boyhood	and	youth." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	 you	 know	 very	 little	 of	 how	 Varick	 lived	 before	 you	 yourself	 met	 him? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p184"></a>How	old	would	he	have	been	then,	Blanche?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	should	think	four	or	five-and-twenty,"	she	said	hesitatingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 suppose,"	 and	 then	 Mark	 Gifford	 looked	 at	 her	 with	 a	 troubled,	 hesitating look,	"I	suppose,	Blanche—I	fear	I'm	going	to	surprise	you—that	you	were	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">aware	that	he'd	been	married	before?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,"	she	said	eagerly,	"I	did	know	that,	Mark." </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	 on	 earth	 was	 he	 driving	 at?	 That	 woman,	 Lionel	 Varick's	 first	 wife,	 was surely	dead?	She,	Blanche,	had	had,	by	a	curious	accident,	someone	else's	word</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 that.	 And	 then—there	 rose	 before	 her	 the	 vision	 of	 a	 ghastly-looking,	 wild, handsome	face;	quickly	she	put	it	from	her,	and	went	on:	"He	married,	when	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	only	nineteen,	a	girl	out	of	his	own	class.	They	separated	for	a	while;	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	seem	to	have	come	together	again,	and,	fortunately	for	Lionel,	she	died." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She	died	murdered—poisoned." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mark	 Gifford	 uttered	 the	 dread	 words	 very	 quietly.	 "Almost	 certainly	 poisoned by	her	husband,	Lionel	Varick." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	mist	came	over	Blanche	Farrow's	eyes.	She	turned	suddenly	sick	and	faint. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	put	out	her	hand	blindly.	Gifford	took	it,	and	made	her	sit	down	on	a	stone</p>
<p class="calibre1">bench. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	 sorry,"	 he	 said	 feelingly,	 "very,	 very	 sorry	 to	 have	 had	 to	 tell	 you	 this dreadful	thing,	Blanche." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Never	 mind,"	 she	 muttered.	 "Go	 on,	 Mark,	 if	 there's	 anything	 else	 to	 say—go on." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	remained	silent	for	a	moment,	she	asked,	in	a	dull,	tired	tone:	"But	if	this awful	thing	is	true,	how	was	it	found	out,	after	so	many	years?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	a	peculiar	story,"	he	answered	reluctantly.	"The	late—I	might	say	the	last—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	 Varick,	 whose	 name,	 as	 you	 of	 course	 know,	 was	 Millicent	 Fauncey,	 had first	 as	 governess,	 and	 then	 as	 companion,	 an	 elderly	 woman	 called	 by	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">extraordinary	 name	 of	 Pigchalke.	 This	 Julia	 Pigchalke	 seemed	 to	 have	 hated</p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	 from	 the	 first.	 She	 violently	 disapproved	 of	 the	 engagement,	 quarrelled with	 Miss	 Fauncey	 about	 it,	 and	 the	 two	 women	 never	 met	 after	 the	 marriage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 Miss	 Pigchalke	 evidently	 cared	 deeply	 for	 poor	 Mrs.	 Varick;	 I've	 seen	 her, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p185"></a>and	convinced	myself	of	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	is	she	like?"	asked	Blanche	suddenly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	she's	not	attractive!	A	stout,	stumpy,	grey-haired	woman,	with	a	very	red</p>
<p class="calibre1">face." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	covered	her	eyes	with	her	hands.	"Go	on,"	she	said	again,	"go	on,	Mark, with	what	you	were	saying." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where	was	I?	Oh,	I	know	now!	When	Mrs.	Varick	died,	within	less	than	a	year</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 her	 marriage,	 Miss	 Pigchalke	 suspected	 foul	 play,	 and	 she	 deliberately	 set herself	 to	 track	 Lionel	 Varick	 down.	 She	 made	 it	 her	 business	 to	 find	 out everything	about	him,	and	but	for	her	I	think	we	may	take	it	that	he	would	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">gone	 on	 to	 the	 end	 of	 the	 chapter	 a	 respectable,	 and	 in	 time	 highly	 respected, member	of	society." </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	pause.	Blanche	was	staring	before	her,	listening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"About	five	weeks	ago,"	went	on	Mark	Gifford	quietly,	"Miss	Pigchalke	got	into touch	 with	 the	 head	 of	 our	 Criminal	 Investigation	 Department.	 She	 put	 before him	 certain—one	 can	 hardly	 call	 them	 facts—but	 certain	 discoveries	 she	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">made,	 which	 led	 to	 the	 body	 of	 the	 first	 Mrs.	 Varick	 being	 exhumed."	 Blanche Farrow	 uttered	 a	 stifled	 exclamation	 of	 surprise,	 and	 Gifford	 went	 on:	 "I	 may add	that	Miss	Pigchalke	behaved	with	remarkable	cunning	and	intelligence.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">found	out	that	the	doctor	at	Redsands—the	place	where	her	poor	friend	died—</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 a	 firm	 friend	 of	 Varick's.	 She	 thinks	 him	 an	 accomplice,	 but	 of	 course	 we regard	that	as	nonsense,	for	we've	found	out	all	about	the	man,	and	he	is	coming</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	see	our	toxological	expert	to-morrow." </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Then	that	was	Dr.	Panton's	urgent	appointment	in	town.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	 now,	 Blanche,	 comes	 the	 curious	 part	 of	 the	 story!	 The	 doctor	 who	 had attended	the	first	Mrs.	Varick	years	and	years	ago	 <i class="calibre4">had</i>	suspected	foul	play.	He's	a very	 old	 man	 now,	 and	 he	 retired	 many	 years	 ago,	 but	 he	 happened	 to	 come across	an	advertisement	which	Miss	Pigchalke	put	into	one	of	the	Sunday	papers</p>
<p class="calibre1">asking	 for	 information	 concerning	 Lionel	 Varick's	 past	 life.  <i class="calibre4">He	 answered	 the</i> <i class="calibre4">advertisement</i>,	with	the	result	that	his	one-time	patient	was	exhumed.	It	was	then found	beyond	doubt	that	the	woman	had	been	poisoned;	and	a	few	days	ago	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">second	Mrs.	Varick's	body	was	exhumed." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	looked	up,	and	in	answer	to	her	haggard	look,	he	said:	"Though	perhaps</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p186"></a>I	 oughtn't	 to	 tell	 you	 so,	 there	 isn't	 a	 shadow	 of	 doubt	 that	 she	 also	 was	 foully done	to	death,	and	rather	more	intelligently	than	the	other	poor	soul,	for	in	 <i class="calibre4">her</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">case	 the	 process	 was	 allowed	 to	 take	 longer,	 and	 the	 doctor	 attending	 her	 was quite	taken	in." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How	horrible!"	muttered	Blanche.	"How	very,	very	horrible!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	horrible	indeed!	But	why	I've	come	here	to-day,	Blanche,	is	to	tell	you	that to-morrow	Lionel	Varick	will	be	arrested	on	the	charge	of	murder.	I	have	come</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	say	that	you	and	Bubbles	must	leave	Wyndfell	Hall	this	afternoon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	hardly	heard	what	he	was	saying.	She	was	absorbed	in	the	horror	and	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	amazement	of	the	story	he	had	just	told	her,	and	in	what	was	going	to	happen</p>
<p class="calibre1">to-morrow	to	the	man	who	had	been	for	so	long	her	familiar	friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	 is	 an	 immense	 relief	 to	 me	 to	 hear	 that	 you	 never	 even	 saw	 the	 late	 Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick."	Mark	Gifford	went	on:	"I	was	afraid	that	you	might	have	been	mixed	up with	this	dreadful	business;	that	he	might	have	used	you	in	some	way." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	 shook	 her	 head,	 and	 he	 went	 on,	 musingly:	 "There	 were	 two	 ladies living	 next	 door	 to	 the	 house	 at	 Redsands	 where	 the	 poor	 woman	 was	 done	 to death.	They,	I	expect,	will	have	to	give	evidence,	at	least	I	know	that	one	of	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">will,	a	certain	Miss—Miss—?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Brabazon?"	supplied	Blanche	quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	 that's	 the	 name!	 A	 certain	 Miss	 Brabazon	 was	 a	 great	 deal	 with	 Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick.	She	seems	to	have	been	an	intimate	friend	of	both	the	husband	and	wife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	used	to	go	out	with	Varick	for	motor	drives.	Has	he	ever	spoken	to	you	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Miss	Brabazon	is	here,	now,	at	Wyndfell	Hall,"	exclaimed	Blanche.	"You	must have	 heard	 of	 her,	 Mark?	 She's	 the	 owner	 of	 some	 tremendously	 big	 city</p>
<p class="calibre1">business." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,	I	don't	think	it	can	be	that	girl!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mark	Gifford	looked	surprised	and	perturbed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But	I	know	it's	that	girl.	She's	become	quite	a	friend	of	mine,	and	of	Bubbles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh,	 Mark,	 I	 do	  <i class="calibre4">hope</i>	 Helen	 Brabazon	 won't	 be	 brought	 into	 this	 dreadful business—d'you	think	that	will	be	really	necessary?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p187"></a>"I	 don't	 know,"	 he	 said	 slowly.	 "But	 some	 of	 our	 people	 think	 that	 Varick	 may put	up	a	fight.	British	criminal	law	is	much	too	kind	to	murderers.	Even	if	there's</p>
<p class="calibre1">evidence	enough	to	hang	a	man	ten	times	over,	there's	always	a	sporting	chance</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	may	get	off!	There	is	in	this	case." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	 turned	 suddenly	 very	 pale.	 The	 full	 realization	 of	 what	 those	 words meant	rushed	upon	her.	He	feared	she	was	going	to	faint. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Forgive	me,"	she	muttered.	"It's	stupid,	I	know;	but	you	must	remember	that—</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	I've	known	Lionel	Varick	a	long	time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	not	a	bit	surprised	that	you	are	so	distressed,"	he	said	soothingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then	 something	 happened	 which	 did	 surprise	 Mark	 Gifford!	 He	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">supposed	to	be	a	clever,	intelligent	man,	and	there	were	many	people	who	went</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	awe	of	him;	but	he	knew	very	little	about	women.	This,	perhaps,	was	why	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt	utterly	astounded	when	Blanche	suddenly	burst	into	tears,	and	began	rocking</p>
<p class="calibre1">herself	 backwards	 and	 forwards.	 "Oh,	 Mark!"	 she	 sobbed.	 "Oh,	 Mark,	 I'm	 so unhappy,—I'm	so	miserable—I'm	so	frightened.	Do—do	help	me!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	just	what	I	came	to	do,"	he	said	simply.	But	he	was	very	much	troubled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	face	was	full	of	a	kind	of	agonized	appeal.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Greatly	daring,	he	bent	down	over	her,	and	gathered	her	into	his	arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	clung	to	him	convulsively;	and,	all	at	once,	there	came	insistently	to	Mark</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gifford,	 George	 Herbert's	 beautiful	 saying:	 "There	 is	 an	 hour	 in	 which	 a	 man may	be	happy	all	his	life,	can	he	but	find	it."	Perhaps	that	hour,	that	moment,	had come	to	him	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Blanche,"	 he	 whispered,	 "Blanche—darling!	 You	 didn't	 really	 mean	 what	 you wrote	yesterday?	Don't	you	think	the	time	has	come	when	two	such	old	friends</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	you	and	I	might—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"—make	fools	of	themselves?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	up	at	him,	and	there	came	a	quivering	smile	over	her	disfigured	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	if	you	really	wish	it,	Mark.	I'll	do	just	as	you	like." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"D'you	really	mean	that?"	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	she	said	firmly:	"Yes,	Mark—I	really	do	mean	it."	And	he	felt	her	yielding</p>
<p class="calibre1">—yielding	in	spirit	as	well	as	in	body—in	body	as	well	as	in	spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p188"></a>"I	suppose	you	couldn't	come	back	with	me	to	London,	now?"	he	asked	a	little shyly.	"We	could	get	the	woman	at	the	post	office	down	there	to	send	up	a	letter</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	Bubbles,	explaining	that	you	had	to	go	away	unexpectedly,	and	telling	her	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">follow	you	to	town	to-day." </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	rather	a	wild	proposal,	and	he	was	not	surprised	when	he	saw	her	shake</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	head.	"I	can't	do	that,"	she	said.	"But	oh,	Mark,	I	wish	I	could!	Bubbles	is	in bed.	There	was	an	accident—it's	too	long	to	tell	you	about	it	now.	But,	of	course, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'll	manage	to	get	her	away	to-day." </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	the	oppressive	horror	of	it	all	suddenly	came	back	to	her.	"When	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	say	they	were	going	to	arrest	Lionel?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	uttered	the	words	slowly,	and	with	difficulty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They're	going	to	arrest	him	to-morrow,	Friday,	in	the	early	afternoon,"	he	said in	a	low	voice.	"By	God's	mercy,"	he	spoke	simply,	reverently,	"I	got	your	letter in	time,	Blanche." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 looked	 at	 her	 anxiously.	 "I'm	 afraid	 even	 now	 you	 will	 have	 some	 difficult hours	to	live	through,"	and,	as	he	saw	her	face	change,	"I	trust	absolutely	to	your discretion,"	he	said	hesitatingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	 course,"	 she	 gave	 the	 assurance	 hurriedly.	 "Of	 course	 you	 can	 do	 that, Mark." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	looking	at	her,	he	went	on:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"As	a	matter	of	fact,	the	house	has	been	watched	for	some	days.	If	he	tries	to	get away	he	will	destroy	the—the	sporting	chance	I	mentioned	just	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	must	be	going	back,"	she	said,	getting	up.	"Several	of	the	party	were,	in	any case,	 leaving	 this	 afternoon,	 and	 I	 must	 manage	 to	 get	 everybody	 else	 away	 as well." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 mind	 was	 in	 a	 whirl	 of	 conflicting	 feelings	 and	 emotions.	 And	 then,	 all	 at once,	she	was	moved,	taken	away	from	the	dreadful	problem	of	the	moment,	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	she	saw	in	Mark	Gifford's	face.	It	was	filled	with	a	kind	of	sober	gladness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mark,"	 she	 exclaimed,	 "what	 a	 selfish	 brute	 I've	 always	 been	 to	 you—never giving—always	taking!	I'll	try	to	be	different	now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 held	 out	 her	 hand;	 he	 took	 it	 and	 held	 it	 closely.	 "When	 shall	 I	 see	 you</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p189"></a>again?"	he	asked.	"May	I	come	and	meet	you	and	Bubbles	at	Liverpool	Street	to-morrow?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes—do.	 That	 will	 be	 a	 great	 comfort!"	 And	 then,	 acting	 as	 she	 very	 seldom did,	on	impulse,	Blanche	rather	shamefacedly	held	up	her	face	to	his.... </p>

<p class="calibre1">Again	and	again,	as	Blanche	Farrow	walked	slowly	back	to	Wyndfell	Hall,	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">went	over	the	meagre	details	of	the	strange	story	she	had	just	been	told.	Again</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	again	she	tried	to	fill	in	the	bare	outlines	of	the	tale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lionel	Varick	a	murderer?	Her	mind,	her	heart,	refused	to	accept	the	possibility. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly	there	came	back	to	her	a	recollection	of	the	curious,	now	many	years</p>
<p class="calibre1">old,	circumstances	which	had	attended	her	knowledge	of	Varick's	first	marriage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone,	she	could	not	now	remember	who,	had	taken	her	to	one	of	the	cheap</p>
<p class="calibre1">foreign	restaurants	in	Soho,	which	were	not	then	so	much	frequented	by	English</p>
<p class="calibre1">people	as	they	are	now.	She	had	been	surprised,	and	rather	amused,	to	see	Lionel</p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	 at	 a	 neighbouring	 table,	 apparently	 entertaining	 a	 middle-aged,	 rather prim-looking	lady,	whom	he	had	introduced	to	her,	Blanche,	rather	unwillingly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	"my	friend,	Miss	Weatherfield." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	had	come	the	strange	part	of	the	story! </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	on	her	way	to	stay	with	some	friends	in	Sussex	a	few	days	later,	she	found</p>
<p class="calibre1">herself	in	the	same	railway	carriage	as	Miss	Weatherfield;	and,	during	the	course</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 some	 desultory	 talk,	 the	 latter	 had	 mentioned	 that	 she	 was	 daughter	 to	 the Chichester	doctor	who	had	attended	Lionel	Varick's	wife	in	her	last	illness. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Lionel	Varick's	wife</i>?	For	a	moment	Blanche	had	thought	that	there	must	be	some mistake,	or	that	her	ears	had	betrayed	her.	But	she	very	soon	realized	that	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	no	mistake,	and	that	she	had	heard	aright. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Successfully	concealing	her	ignorance	of	the	fact	that	their	mutual	friend	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">widower,	she	had	ventured	a	few	discreet	questions,	to	which	had	come	willing</p>
<p class="calibre1">answers.	These	made	it	clear	why	Varick	had	chosen	to	remain	silent	concerning</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	had	evidently	been	a	sordid	and	melancholy	episode	of	his	past	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	 Weatherfield	 told	 her	 pleasant	 new	 acquaintance	 that	 the	 Varicks,	 when</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	had	first	come	to	Chichester,	had	been	very	poor,	the	wife	of	an	obviously</p>
<p class="calibre1">lower	class	than	the	husband.	But	that	Varick,	being	the	gentleman	he	was,	had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p191"></a>not	 minded	 what	 he	 did	 to	 earn	 an	 honest	 living,	 and	 that	 through	 Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weatherfield	he	had	obtained	for	a	while	employment	with	a	chemist,	his	work</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	 that	 of	 taking	 round	 the	 medicines,	 as	 he	 was	 not	 of	 course	 qualified	 to make	up	prescriptions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	 Miss	 Weatherfield	 had	 babbled	 on,	 Blanche	 had	 been	 able	 to	 piece</p>
<p class="calibre1">together	 what	 had	 evidently	 been	 a	 singularly	 painful	 story.	 Mrs.	 Varick	 had been	a	violent,	disagreeable	woman,	and	the	kindly	spinster	had	felt	deeply	sorry</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	the	husband,	himself	little	more	than	a	boy.	But	she	admitted	that	her	father, </p>
<p class="calibre1">while	attending	Mrs.	Varick,	had	acquired	a	prejudice	against	the	husband	of	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">patient,	and	she	added,	smilingly,	that	it	was	without	her	father's	knowledge	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">consent	that	she	had	given	the	young	man,	after	the	death	of	his	wife,	a	valuable</p>
<p class="calibre1">business	introduction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	 Weatherfield	 evidently	 flattered	 herself	 that	 this	 introduction	 had	 been	 a turning-point	in	Varick's	life,	and	that	what	appeared	to	her	his	present	prosperity</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 owing	 to	 what	 she	 had	 done.	 In	 any	 case,	 he	 had	 shown	 his	 gratitude	 by keeping	in	touch	with	her,	and	on	the	rare	occasions	when	she	came	to	London, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they	generally	met. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	Farrow,	even	in	those	early	days,	was	too	much	a	woman	of	the	world</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	feel	as	surprised	as	some	people	would	have	been.	All	the	same,	she	had	felt</p>
<p class="calibre1">disconcerted	and	a	little	pained,	that	the	man	who	was	fond	of	telling	her	that	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	his	only	real	friend	in	the	world	had	concealed	from	her	so	important	a	fact</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	that	of	his	marriage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 some	 hesitation	 she	 had	 made	 up	 her	 mind	 to	 tell	 him	 of	 her	 new-found knowledge,	and	at	once	he	had	filled	in	and	coloured	the	sketchy	outlines	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">picture	 drawn	 by	 the	 rather	 foolish	 if	 kindly	 natured	 Miss	 Weatherfield.	 Yes,	 it was	true	that	he	had	been	a	fool,	though	a	quixotic	fool—so	Blanche	had	felt	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">hearing	 his	 version	 of	 the	 story.	 At	 the	 time	 of	 the	 marriage	 Varick	 had	 been nineteen,	his	wife	five	years	older.	The	two	had	soon	parted,	but	they	had	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	their	differences	after	a	separation	which	lasted	four	years.	Varick's	fortunes</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	then	been	at	their	lowest	ebb,	and	the	two	had	drifted	to	Chichester,	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	 Varick	 had	 humble,	 respectable	 relations.	 After	 a	 while	 the	 woman	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">fallen	 ill,	 and	 finally	 died.	 Blanche	 had	 seen	 how	 it	 had	 pained	 and	 disturbed Varick	to	rake	out	the	embers	of	the	past,	and	neither	had	ever	referred	to	the	sad</p>
<p class="calibre1">story	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p192"></a>And	 now,	 from	 considering	 the	 past,	 Blanche	 Farrow	 turned	 shrinkingly	 to	 the present. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 common	 with	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 world,	 she	 had	 at	 times	 followed	 the	 course	 of some	great	murder	trial;	and	she	had	been	interested,	as	most	intelligent	people</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	 occasionally	 interested,	 in	 the	 ins	 and	 outs	 of	 more	 than	 one	 so-called</p>
<p class="calibre1">"poisoning	mystery." </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 such	 happenings	 had	 seemed	 utterly	 remote	 from	 herself;	 and	 to	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagination	the	word	"murderer"	had	connoted	an	eccentric,	cunning,	mentally misshapen	monster,	lacking	all	resemblance	to	the	vast	bulk	of	human	kind.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">tried	 to	 realize	 that,	 if	 Mark	 Gifford's	 tale	 were	 true,	 a	 man	 with	 whom	 she herself	 had	 long	 been	 in	 close	 sympathy,	 and	 whose	 peculiar	 character	 she	 had rather	prided	herself	on	understanding,	had	been—nay,	was—such	a	monster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	 felt	 a	 touch	 of	 shuddering	 repulsion	 from	 herself,	 as	 well	 as	 from Varick,	 as	 she	 now	 remembered	 how	 sincerely	 she	 had	 rejoiced	 when,	 reading</p>
<p class="calibre1">between	 the	 lines	 of	 his	 letter,	 she	 had	 guessed	 that	 he	 was	 marrying	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">unattractive	 woman	 for	 her	 money.	 It	 was	 now	 a	 comfort	 to	 feel	 that,	 even	 so, she	had	certainly	felt	a	sensation	of	disgust	when	it	had	come	to	her	knowledge</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 Varick	 had	 assumed,	 with	 regard	 to	 that	 same	 unattractive	 woman,	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">extravagant	 devotion	 she	 felt	 convinced	 he	 did	 not—could	 not—feel.	 It	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">shocked	 her,	 made	 her	 feel	 uncomfortable,	 to	 hear	 Helen	 Brabazon's	 artless</p>
<p class="calibre1">allusions	to	the	tenderness	and	devotion	he	had	lavished	on	"poor	Milly." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	 Brabazon?	 A	 sensation	 of	 pain,	 almost	 of	 shame,	 swept	 over	 Blanche</p>
<p class="calibre1">Farrow.	Were	Helen	to	appear	as	witness	in	a	 <i class="calibre4">cause	célèbre</i>	the	girl's	life	would henceforth	be	shadowed	and	smirched	by	an	awful	memory.	And	then	there	rose</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	her	mind	another	dread	possibility.	Was	it	not	possible—nay,	probable—</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	she,	Blanche	Farrow,	would	be	sucked	into	the	vortex? </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	remembered	a	case	in	which	the	prisoner	had	been	charged	with	the	murder</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	a	relation	through	whose	death	he	had	received	considerable	benefit,	and	how</p>
<p class="calibre1">four	 or	 five	 men	 and	 women	 of	 repute	 had	 been	 called	 to	 testify	 to	 his	 high character,	 and	 to	 the	 kindness	 of	 his	 heart.	 But	 their	 evidence	 had	 availed	 him nothing,	for	he	had	been	hanged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	 quickened	 her	 footsteps	 as,	 in	 imagination,	 she	 saw	 herself	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">witness-box	speaking	on	behalf	of	Lionel	Varick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 argued	 with	 herself	 that,	 after	 all,	 it	 was	 just	 possible	 that	 he	 might	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p193"></a>innocent!	If	so,	she	would	fight	for	him	to	the	death,	and	that,	however	much	it distressed	and	angered	Mark	Gifford	that	she	should	do	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Absorbed	 in	 the	 dread	 and	 terrible	 thing	 he	 had	 come	 to	 tell	 her,	 she	 had	 not given	him,	the	man	who	loved	her,	and	whose	wife	she	was	to	be,	one	thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">since	 their	 solemn,	 rather	 shamefaced,	 embrace.	 Yet	 now	 the	 knowledge	 that, </p>
<p class="calibre1">however,	much	he	disapproved,	Mark	would	stand	by	her,	gave	her	a	wonderful</p>
<p class="calibre1">feeling	of	security,	of	having	left	the	open	sea	of	life	for	a	safe	harbour—and	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	spite	of	the	terrible	hours,	perhaps	the	terrible	weeks	and	months,	which	now</p>
<p class="calibre1">lay	before	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning	the	sharp	angle	which	led	to	the	gate	giving	admittance	to	the	gardens	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wyndfell	Hall,	she	suddenly	met	Helen	Brabazon	face	to	face,	and	for	one	wild</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment	Blanche	thought	that	Helen	 <i class="calibre4">knew</i>.	The	girl's	usually	placid,	comely	face was	disfigured.	It	was	plain	that	she	had	been	crying	bitterly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	going	to	the	village,"	she	exclaimed;	"I've	got	to	go	home	to-day,	and	I	must telegraph	to	my	uncle." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	hope	you	haven't	had	bad	news?"	said	Blanche	mechanically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 was	 telling	 herself	 that	 it	 was	 quite,	 quite	 impossible	 that	 Helen	 knew anything—but	as	Helen,	who	had	begun	crying	again,	shook	her	head,	Blanche</p>
<p class="calibre1">asked:	"Does	Lionel	know	that	you	want	to	leave	to-day?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes;	 I	 have	 told	 Mr.	 Varick,"	 and	 then	 all	 at	 once	 she	 exclaimed:	 "Oh,	 Miss Farrow,	I	feel	so	utterly	miserable!	Mr.	Varick	has	just	asked	me	to	be	his	wife, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	it	has	made	me	feel	as	if	I	had	been	so	treacherous	to	Milly.	Yet	I	don't	think</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	did	anything	to	make	him	like	me?	Do	you	think	I	did?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	appealingly	at	Blanche. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	plain	that	what	had	happened	had	given	her	an	extraordinary	shock.	"I	am</p>
<p class="calibre1">sure,	now,"	she	went	on	falteringly,	"that	Milly—poor,	poor	Milly—haunts	this house.	I	have	felt,	again	and	again,	as	if	she	were	hovering	about	me.	I	believe</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 what	 I	 saw	 in	 the	 hall,	 on	 that	 awful	 afternoon,	 was	 really	  <i class="calibre4">her</i>.	 Yet	 Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	 says	 that	 Milly	 would	 be	 very	 pleased	 if	 he	 and	 I	 were	 to	 marry	 each other.	Surely	he	is	mistaken?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,"	said	Blanche	slowly,	"I	think	he	is." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p194"></a>"I	feel	so	miserable,"	went	on	the	girl,	still	speaking	with	a	touch	of	excitement which	 in	 her	 was	 so	 very	 unusual.	 "What	 happened	 this	 morning	 has	 spoiled what	 I	 thought	 was	 such	 a	 beautiful	 friendship!	 And	 then	 I	 feel	 frightened—</p>
<p class="calibre1">horribly	frightened"—she	went	on	in	a	low	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	is	it	that	frightens	you,	Helen?"	asked	Blanche. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These	 confidences	 seemed	 at	 once	 so	 futile,	 and	 yet	 also	 so	 sinister,	 knowing what	she	now	knew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	 afraid	 that	 Mr.	 Varick	 will	 'will'	 me	 into	 thinking	 I	 care	 for	 him,"	 the	 girl confessed	 in	 a	 low	 voice.	 "He	 says	 that	 he	 will	 never	 give	 up	 hope,	 and	 that, although	he	knows	he	isn't	worthy	of	me,	he	thinks	that	in	time	I	shall	care	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">him.	 But	 I	 don't	 want	 to	 care	 for	 him,	 Miss	 Farrow—I'm	 sure	 that	 Milly	 is jealous	of	me;	yet	at	Redsands,	when	she	was	dying,	it	made	her	happy	that	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	friends." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 don't	 think	 you	 need	 be	 afraid	 that	 Lionel	 will	 ever	 ask	 you	 to	 marry	 him again,"	 said	 Blanche	 firmly.	 "And,	 Helen?	 Let	 me	 give	 you	 a	 word	 of	 advice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Never,	never,	tell	anyone	of	what	happened	to	you	this	morning." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girl	blushed	painfully.	"I	know	I	ought	not	to	have	told	you,"	she	whispered, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"but	I	felt	so	wretched."	She	hesitated,	and	then	added:	"Ever	since	it	happened	I have	 been	 remembering	 that	 first	 evening,	 when	 my	 dear	 father	 warned	 me	 to leave	this	house.	Oh,	how	I	wish	I	had	done	what	he	told	me	to	do!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	think	you	are	wrong	there,"	said	Blanche.	"I	think	a	day	will	come,	Helen,	and in	 spite	 of	 anything	 that	 has	 happened,	 or	 that	 may	 happen,	 when	 you	 will	 be very	glad	that	you	stayed	on	at	Wyndfell	Hall." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do	you?"	she	said	wistfully	and	then	she	went	on,	with	a	note	of	diffidence	and shyness	which	touched	the	older	woman:	"You	and	Bubbles	have	both	been	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">kind	to	me—would	you	rather	that	I	stayed	on	with	you?	I	will	if	you	like." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As	 a	 matter	 of	 fact,	 Bubbles	 and	 I	 are	 going	 away	 to-day,	 after	 all,"	 said Blanche,	"so	let	me	send	one	of	the	men	down	with	your	telegram." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 would	 rather	 take	 it	 myself—really!"	 and	 a	 moment	 later	 she	 disappeared round	the	sharp	turning	which	led	on	to	the	open	road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	walked	on,	her	eyes	on	the	ground,	until	there	fell	on	her	ears	the	sound</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p195"></a>of	 quick	 footsteps.	 She	 looked	 up,	 to	 see	 Varick's	 tall	 figure	 hurrying	 towards her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	met	by	the	moat	bridge,	and	as	he	came	up	to	her	he	saw	her	pull	forward</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	veil	which,	neatly	arranged	round	the	rim	of	her	small	felt	hat,	was	not	really</p>
<p class="calibre1">meant	to	cover	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's	 walk	 down	 here	 for	 a	 moment,"	 he	 said	 abruptly.	 "I	 want	 to	 ask	 you	 a question,	Blanche." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	stepped	off	the	carriage	road	on	to	the	grass,	and,	walking	on	a	few	paces, </p>
<p class="calibre1">stood	 together	 at	 the	 exact	 spot	 from	 which	 Varick,	 on	 Christmas	 Eve,	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	at	the	house	before	him	with	such	exultant	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three	weeks	ago	Wyndfell	Hall	had	appeared	kindly	and	welcoming,	as	well	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">mysteriously	beautiful,	with	its	old	diamond-paned	windows	all	aglow.	Now,	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 wintry	 daylight,	 the	 ancient	 dwelling	 house	 still	 looked	 mysteriously</p>
<p class="calibre1">beautiful;	but	there	was	something	cold,	menacing,	forlorn	in	its	appearance.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">windows	looked	like	blind	eyes.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 turned	 on	 her	 suddenly,	 and	 held	 out	 the	 telegram	 she	 had	 received	 that morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"One	of	the	servants	picked	this	up	on	the	breakfast	table	and	brought	it	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	the	devil	does	it	mean?	If	Mark	Gifford	wanted	to	see	you	why	couldn't	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">come	here?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	looked	at	him	dumbly.	Had	her	life	depended	on	her	speaking	she	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	have	spoken	just	then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	went	on:	"Have	you	seen	Gifford?	Did	he	say	anything	about	me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	uttered	the	words	with	a	kind	of	breathless	haste.	She	had	the	painful	feeling</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	he	wanted	to	put	her	in	the	wrong,	to	quarrel	with	her.	Even	as	he	spoke	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	tearing	the	telegram	into	small	pieces,	and	casting	them	down	on	to	the	neat, </p>
<p class="calibre1">well-kept	grass	path. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 suspect	 I	 know	 the	 business	 he	 came	 about—"	 He	 was	 speaking	 quietly, collectedly,	now,	and	she	felt	that	he	was	making	a	great	effort	to	speak	calmly</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	confidently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 don't	 think,	 Lionel,	 that	 you	 can	 know,"	 she	 answered	 at	 last,	 in	 an	 almost</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p196"></a>inaudible	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,	let	me	tell	you	what	it	is	that	I	suspect,"	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	long	pause.	He	was	looking	at	her	warily,	wondering,	evidently,	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	how	far	he	dared	confide	in	her.	And	that	look	of	his	made	her	feel	sick	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">faint. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	suspect,"	he	said	at	last,	"that	Gifford	came	to	tell	you	a	cock-and-bull	story concocted	by	my	wife's	companion,	a	woman	called	Julia	Pigchalke." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	Lionel,	you	have	guessed	right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	an	unutterable	relief	that	he	thus	made	the	way	easy	for	her;	a	relief—but</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	now	knew	that	what	Gifford	had	told	her	was	true. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	wants	me	to	get	everyone	away	from	here	to-day,"	she	went	on,	in	a	tone	so low	that	he	could	scarcely	hear	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Away	from	here?	To-day?"	he	repeated,	startled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes,	 away	 before	 to-morrow	 midday."	 She	 moistened	 her	 dry	 lips	 with	 her tongue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	am	the	victim	of	a	foul	conspiracy!"	he	exclaimed.	"Panton	warned	me	that	I should	have	trouble	with	that	woman."	He	waited	a	moment,	then:	"Did	Gifford tell	 you	 that	 they	 have	 sent	 for	 Panton?"	 he	 asked	 suddenly.	 So	 that,	 she	 told herself,	 was	 what	 had	 really	 put	 him	 on	 the	 track.	 She	 nodded,	 and	 he	 added grimly:	"They	won't	get	much	out	of	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he	was	going	to	fight	it—fight	it	to	the	last? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	will	stand	my	friend,	Blanche,"	he	asked,	and	slowly	she	bent	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	course	you	know	what	this	woman	Pigchalke	wishes	to	prove?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 was	 now	 looking	 keenly,	 breathlessly,	 into	 her	 pale,	 set	 face.	 "Come,"	 he said,	 "come,	 Blanche—don't	 be	 so	 upset!	 Tell	 me	 exactly	 what	 it	 was	 that Gifford	told	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	she	shook	her	head.	"I—I	can't,"	she	murmured. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then	I	will	tell	you	what	perhaps	he	felt	ashamed	to	say	to	any	friend	of	mine—</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	is	that	Julia	Pigchalke	suspects	me	of	having	done	my	poor	Milly	to	death! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p197"></a>She	went	and	saw	Panton;	she	did	more,	she	actually	advertised	for	particulars	of my	past	life.	Did	he	know	that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 waited,	 for	 what	 seemed	 a	 very	 long	 time	 to	 Blanche,	 and	 then	 in	 a	 voice which,	 try	 as	 he	 might,	 was	 yet	 full	 of	 suppressed	 anxiety,	 he	 added:	 "She	 had got	hold	somehow	of	the	fact	that	I	once	lived	at	Chichester." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	 looked	 down,	 and	 she	 counted	 over,	 twice,	 the	 thirty	 little	 bits	 of	 the torn	telegram	before	she	answered,	in	a	low,	muffled	voice:	"It's	what	happened</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	Chichester,	Lionel,	that	made	them	listen	to	her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	long	moment	of	tense,	of	terrible,	silence	between	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 last	 Varick	 broke	 the	 silence,	 and,	 speaking	 in	 an	 easy,	 if	 excited, </p>
<p class="calibre1">conversational	 tone,	 he	 exclaimed:	 "That's	 a	 bit	 of	 bad	 luck	 for	 me!	 I	 have	 an enemy	 there—an	 old	 fool	 of	 a	 doctor—father	 of	 that	 woman	 you	 met	 me	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">years	ago." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	walked	on	a	few	steps,	leaving	her	standing,	and	then	came	back	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More	 seriously	 he	 asked	 the	 fateful	 question:	 "I	 take	 it	 I	 am	 to	 be	 arrested	 to-morrow?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	saw	by	her	face	that	he	had	guessed	truly,	and	as	if	speaking	to	himself,	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	musingly:	"That	means	I	have	twenty-four	hours." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 forced	 herself	 to	 say:	 "They	 think	 you	 have	 a	 good	 sporting	 chance	 if	 you stay	where	you	are." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It	 never	 occurred	 to	 me	 to	 go	 away!"	 he	 said	 angrily.	 "I	 want	 you	 always	 to remember,	Blanche,	that	I	told	you,	here,	and	now,	that,	even	if	appearances	may</p>
<p class="calibre1">come	to	seem	damnably	against	me,	I	am	an	innocent	man." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	answered:	"I	will	always	remember	that,	and	always	say	so." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	said	abruptly:	"I	want	you	to	do	me	a	kindness." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	asked	uneasily:	"What	is	it,	Lionel?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	want	you	to	get	Gifford	to	prevent	the	meeting	which	has	been	arranged	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">to-morrow	morning	between	Panton	and	the	Home	Office	expert	called	Spiller." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 waited	 a	 moment,	 then	 went	 on:	 "It	 was	 the	 summons	 to	 Panton	 which	 put me	on	the	track	of—of	this	conspiracy."	And	Blanche	felt	that	this	time	Varick</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p198"></a>was	speaking	the	truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	said,	deprecatingly:	"Mark	would	do	a	great	deal	to	please	me,	but	I'm	afraid he	won't	do	that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	think	he	may,"	he	answered,	in	a	singular	tone,	"you	may	have	a	greater	power of	persuasion	than	you	know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	made	no	answer	to	that,	knowing	well	that	Mark	would	never	interfere	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">regard	to	such	a	matter	as	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can	 you	 suggest	 any	 reason	 I	 can	 give,	 why	 we	 should	 be	 all	 going	 away	 to-day?"	she	asked	falteringly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	a	moment's	hesitation	he	answered:	"You	can	say	there	has	been	trouble</p>
<p class="calibre1">among	the	servants,	and	that	I	should	feel	much	obliged	if	I	could	have	the	house</p>
<p class="calibre1">cleared	of	all	my	visitors	by	to-night." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	Blanche	Farrow	came	to	a	sudden	determination.	"I	will	get	them	all	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">to-day,	Lionel,	but	I,	myself,	will	stay	till	to-morrow	morning." </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	the	first	time	during	this	strange,	to	her	this	unutterably	painful	conversation, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick	 showed	 a	 touch	 of	 real,	 genuine	 feeling.	 It	 was	 as	 if	 a	 mask	 had	 fallen from	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p199"></a>He	gripped	her	hand.	"You're	a	brick!"	he	exclaimed.	"I	ought	to	tell	you	to	go away,	too,	but	I	won't	be	proud,	Blanche.	I'll	accept	your	kindness." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p200"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	XXIII</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">There	are	hours	in	almost	every	life	of	which	the	memory	is	put	away,	hidden,	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">far	as	may	be,	in	an	unfathomable	pit.	Blanche	Farrow	never	recalled	to	herself, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 never	 discussed	 with	 any	 living	 being,	 the	 hours	 which	 followed	 her	 talk with	Lionel	Varick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	 the	 five	 people	 to	 whom	 she	 told	 the	 untrue	 tale	 so	 quickly	 and	 so	 cleverly imagined	by	their	host,	only	one	suspected	that	she	was	not	telling	the	truth.	That</p>
<p class="calibre1">one—oddly	 enough—was	 Sir	 Lyon	 Dilsford.	 He	 guessed	 that	 something	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrong,	and	in	one	sense	he	got	near	to	the	truth—but	it	was	such	a	very	small	bit</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	truth! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sir	 Lyon	 suspected	 that	 Varick	 had	 made	 an	 offer	 to	 Helen	 Brabazon,	 and	 that she	had	refused	him.	But	he	was	never	to	know	if	his	suspicion	had	been	correct, </p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 he	 was	 one	 of	 those	 rare	 human	 being	 who	 are	 never	 tempted	 to	 ask</p>
<p class="calibre1">indiscreet	or	unnecessary	questions	from	even	their	nearest	and	dearest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 answer	 to	 Miss	 Farrow's	 apologies	 and	 explanations,	 everyone,	 of	 course, </p>
<p class="calibre1">expressed	 himself	 or	 herself	 as	 very	 willing	 to	 fall	 in	 with	 the	 suggestion	 that they	should	all	travel	up	to	town	together	that	day.	It	also	seemed	quite	natural	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	all,	even	to	Bubbles,	that	Blanche	should	stay	behind	for	the	one	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	not	the	sort	of	woman	to	leave	a	task	half	done.	She	had	engaged	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">servants,	 and	 she	 would	 remain	 to	 settle	 up	 with	 them.	 The	 average	 man—and most	 of	 them	 thought	 Varick	 an	 average	 man—is	 helpless	 in	 dealing	 with	 so</p>
<p class="calibre1">complicated	a	domestic	problem	as	a	number	of	job	servants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	hours	of	the	early	afternoon	went	by,	Blanche	more	and	more	marvelled</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 Varick's	 extraordinary	 powers	 of	 self-command.	 Excepting	 that	 he	 was, </p>
<p class="calibre1">perhaps,	 a	 little	 more	 restless	 than	 usual,	 he	 was	 at	 his	 best	 as	 the	 courteous, kindly	host,	now	parting	with	regret	from	a	number	of	well-liked	guests. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 even	 succeeded	 in	 putting	 Helen	 Brabazon	 once	 more	 at	 her	 ease,	 for, </p>
<p class="calibre1">choosing	his	opportunity,	he	told	her,	in	a	few	earnest	words	which	touched	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">deeply,	 that	 he	 had	 come	 to	 see	 her	 point	 of	 view,	 and	 to	 acquiesce	 in	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p201"></a>decision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	heard	him	making	an	appointment	with	Dr.	Panton	to	lunch	at	the	Ritz</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	one	of	the	days	of	the	following	week.	He	asked	Sir	Lyon	to	join	them	there; </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	Blanche	saw	the	look	of	real	chagrin	and	annoyance	which	passed	over	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">face	when	Sir	Lyon	declined	the	invitation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 even	 what	 was	 obviously	 sincere	 and	 real,	 seemed	 utterly	 insincere	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">unreal	 to	 Blanche	 Farrow,	 during	 those	 tense	 hours.	 Thus,	 when	 she	 overheard Donnington	and	Bubbles	talking	over	the	arrangements	for	their	wedding,	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">talk	seemed	to	her	all	make-believe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 last,	 however,	 there	 came	 the	 moment	 for	 which	 she	 had	 been	 longing	 for what	seemed	to	her	an	eternity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Brabazon,	Sir	Lyon,	and	Dr.	Panton	were	the	first	to	go	off;	followed,	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	few	minutes'	interval,	Donnington,	Bubbles,	and	the	luggage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	 noticed	 that	 Lionel's	 parting	 with	 Bubbles	 was	 particularly	 suave	 and cordial.	But	the	girl	was	not	at	her	best.	When	her	host	touched	her,	accidentally, </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	shrank	back,	and	his	face	clouded.	And,	as	the	motor	drove	off,	he	turned	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	and	said	discontentedly:	"I	wish	Bubbles	liked	me	better,	Blanche!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	hardly	knew	what	to	answer,	for	it	was	true	that	the	girl	did	not	like	Varick, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	had	never	liked	him.	Yet	it	seemed	such	a	strange	thing	for	him	to	trouble</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	that	 <i class="calibre4">now</i>.	But	Lionel,	poor	Lionel,	had	always	had	an	almost	morbid	wish</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	be	liked—to	stand	well	with	people,	so	she	told	herself	with	a	strange	feeling</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	pain	at	her	heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	walked	back	together	into	the	house,	and	Blanche,	going	over	to	the	fire-</p>
<p class="calibre1">place,	poured	herself	out	another	cup	of	tea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	a	sense	she	still	felt	as	if	she	was	living	through	a	terrible,	unreal	dream,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet	it	was	an	unutterable	relief	to	be	no	longer	obliged	to	pretend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	glanced	furtively	at	Varick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	calm,	cheerful,	collected.	"Will	you	excuse	me	for	a	few	moments?	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 got	 several	 things	 to	 do,"	 he	 said.	 "Then	 I	 think	 I	 will	 go	 out	 and	 tramp about	for	a	bit.	It's	been	a	strain	for	you	as	well	as	for	me,	Blanche,"	he	added sympathetically. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p202"></a>"Yes,	it	has,"	she	answered	almost	inaudibly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is	there	anything	I	can	get	you?"	he	asked.	"Will	you	be	quite	comfortable?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	repeated,	mechanically:	"Quite	comfortable,	thank	you,	Lionel,"	and	then,	as an	after-thought:	"I	suppose	we	shall	dine	at	the	same	time	as	usual?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Certainly—why	not?"	He	looked	puzzled	at	her	question.	"Let	me	see—it's	not much	after	five	now;	I'll	be	back	by	seven." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 walked	 to	 the	 door,	 and	 from	 there	 turned	 round.	 "So	 long!"	 he	 cried	 out cheerily,	 and	 she	 was	 surprised,	 for	 Varick	 seldom	 made	 use	 of	 any	 slang	 or colloquialism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feeling	all	at	once	utterly	exhausted	and	spent,	she	drew	a	deep	chair	forward	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 fire	 and	 lay	 back	 in	 it.	 Her	 mind	 seemed	 completely	 to	 empty	 itself	 of thought.	 She	 neither	 remembered	 the	 past	 nor	 considered	 the	 future,	 and	 very soon	 she	 slipped	 off	 into	 a	 deep	 sleep—the	 sleep	 of	 exhaustion	 which	 so	 often follows	a	great	mental	strain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 must	 have	 been	 over	 an	 hour	 later	 that	 Blanche	 seemed	 to	 awaken	 to	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">perception	that	the	big	oak	door	behind	her,	which	gave	access	to	the	deep-eaved</p>
<p class="calibre1">porch,	had	opened	and	closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	round;	and,	in	the	candle-light,	for	the	fire	had	died	down,	she	saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">Varick,	looking	neither	to	the	right	nor	to	the	left,	walk	quickly	across	the	long</p>
<p class="calibre1">room	and	slip	noiselessly	through	the	door	leading	to	the	interior	of	the	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	it	was	seven	o'clock?	Nearly	three-quarters	of	an	hour	before	she	must	go</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	and	dress	for	dinner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Almost	 at	 once	 she	 was	 asleep	 again,	 to	 be,	 however,	 thoroughly	 awakened	 a few	moments	later	by	the	opening	and	the	shutting	of	a	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	the	old	butler,	a	man	Blanche	had	come	to	like	and	to	respect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	held	a	salver	in	his	hand,	and	on	the	salver	was	a	letter.	"Mr.	Varick	asked	me to	give	you	this	note	at	a	quarter-past	seven,	ma'am.	I	understood	him	to	say	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	might	be	late	for	dinner	to-night	as	he	had	to	go	up	to	the	Reservoir	Cottage." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	sat	up,	all	her	senses	suddenly	on	the	alert. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p203"></a>"Mr.	Varick	came	in	some	minutes	ago,"	she	said,	"at	least,	I	think	he	did." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 was	 beginning	 to	 wonder	 if	 Lionel	 had	 really	 come	 in,	 or	 if	 she	 had	 only dreamt	that	he	had	done	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	think	he	came	in,	ma'am,	for	I've	been	in	the	dining-room,	with	the	door open,	for	a	long	time.	I	would	have	heard	him	if	he	had	come	through	and	gone</p>
<p class="calibre1">upstairs." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	might	see	if	he	is	in,"	she	said	quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	took	the	letter	off	the	salver,	but	did	not	break	the	seal	till	the	old	man	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">come	back	with	the	words:	"No,	ma'am,	Mr.	Varick	is	not	in	the	house." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 lingered	 on	 for	 a	 moment.	 "I	 hope	 you	 will	 forgive	 me,	 ma'am,	 for mentioning	that	Mr.	Varick	told	us	we	could	all	go	off	early	to-morrow	morning</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	 we	 liked,	 instead	 of	 next	 Monday.	 He	 paid	 us	 up	 after	 the	 visitors	 had	 gone away,	and	he	also	gave	us	the	bonus	he	so	kindly	promised.	I	never	wish	to	serve</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	more	generous	gentleman.	But	the	chef	and	I	decided	that	we	would	ask	you, </p>
<p class="calibre1">ma'am,	if	it	is	for	your	convenience	that	we	leave	early	to-morrow?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Anything	that	Mr.	Varick	has	arranged	with	you	will	suit	me,"	she	said	quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As	 a	 matter	 of	 fact,	 I	 think	 he	 would	 like	 you	 to	 leave	 by	 the	 train	 I	 shall	 be going	by	myself." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	man	turned	away	she	looked	down	at	Varick's	letter.	On	the	envelope	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">written	 in	 his	 good,	 clear	 handwriting:	 "The	 Hon.	 Blanche	 Farrow,	 Wyndfell Hall."	But	no	premonition	of	its	contents	reached	her	still	weary,	excited	brain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Written	on	a	large	plain	sheet	of	paper,	the	letter	ran:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"My	dear	Blanche,—I	fear	I	am	going	to	give	you	a	shock—for,	by	the	time	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">reaches	 you,	 there	 will	 have	 been	 another	 accident—one	 very	 similar	 to	 that which	 befell	 poor	 little	 Bubbles.	 But	 this	 time	 there	 will	 be	 no	 clever,	 skilful Panton	to	bring	the	drowned	to	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	suggest	that	you	begin	to	feel	uneasy	about	a	quarter	past	eight.	I	leave	to	your good	 sense	 the	 details	 of	 the	 sad	 discovery.	 I	 have	 but	 one	 request	 to	 make	 to you,	kindest	and	truest	of	friends;	that	is,	that	you	remember	what	I	asked	you	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	with	reference	to	Panton's	appointment	to-morrow	morning.	If	you	can	get	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">telegram	 or	 telephone	 message	 through	 to	 Gifford	 to-night,	 I	 think	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">appointment	 will	 be	 postponed	 indefinitely.	 You	 will	 perhaps	 think	 me	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p204"></a>sentimental	fool	for	wishing	to	keep	Panton's	good	opinion,	but	such	is	my	wish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 am	 distressed	 at	 the	 thought	 of	 the	 trouble	 and	 worry	 to	 which	 you	 must inevitably	be	exposed	to-night.	On	the	other	hand,	much	more	trouble	and	worry</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	future	will	thus	have	been	saved,	even	to	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yours	ever, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lionel	Varick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	trust	to	your	friendship	to	destroy	this	letter	as	soon	as	read." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanche	read	the	letter	once	again,	right	through,	then	she	held	out	the	big	sheet</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	paper,	and	dropped	it	into	the	heart	of	the	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 the	 second	 time	 that	 day	 she	 burst	 into	 tears,	 shaken	 to	 the	 depths	 by	 the extraordinarily	complicated	feelings	which	filled	her	heart	and	mind,	feelings	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">horror	and	of	pain—and	yet	of	intense,	immeasurable	relief! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 she	 pulled	 herself	 together,	 and	 prepared	 to	 act,	 for	 the	 second	 time	 that day,	 her	 part	 in	 a	 tragi-comedy	 in	 which	 where	 there	 had	 been	 two	 characters there	was	now	but	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p205"></a><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	XXIV</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	 Panton's	 appointment	 at	 the	 Home	 Office	 had	 been	 for	 half-past	 ten,	 and, though	 there	 happened	 to	 be	 on	 this	 early	 January	 day	 an	 old-fashioned,	 black London	fog,	he	had	been	punctual	to	the	minute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 now	 eight	 minutes	 to	 eleven,	 and	 he	 began	 to	 feel	 rather	 cross	 and impatient. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 nothing	 to	 do	 in	 the	 big,	 ugly,	 stately	 room	 into	 which	 he	 had	 been shown.	There	was	a	bookcase,	but	it	was	locked,	and	he	had	not	brought	a	paper</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	him—but	that,	perhaps,	was	a	good	thing,	for	the	one	electric	globe	gave	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	bad	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 wondered	 what	 manner	 of	 man	 Dr.	 Spiller	 might	 be—in	 any	 case	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">remarkable	and	distinguished	 person,	one	of	 the	great	authorities	 on	poisons	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 last	 the	 door	 opened,	 and	 Dr.	 Panton	 felt	 surprised—even	 a	 little</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappointed.	Not	so	had	he	imagined	the	famous	Spiller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Forgive	me	for	having	kept	you	waiting,	Dr.—er—Panton." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 tone	 of	 the	 quiet-looking,	 middle-aged	 man	 who	 stood	 before	 him	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">extremely	courteous,	if	a	trifle	uncertain	and	nervous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	I	hadn't	been	lodging	close	by	I	should	have	been	late,	too,	Dr.	Spiller." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My	name	is	not	Spiller,"	said	the	other	quickly.	"I	have	come	to	explain	to	you that	 the	 matter	 concerning	 which	 you	 were	 to	 see	 Dr.	 Spiller	 this	 morning	 has been	 settled.	 We	 should	 have	 saved	 you	 the	 trouble	 of	 coming	 here	 had	 we</p>
<p class="calibre1">known	where	you	were	staying	in	London." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	 Panton	 felt,	 not	 unreasonably,	 annoyed.	 "If	 only	 Dr.	 Spiller	 had	 sent	 me	 a wire	 yesterday,"	 he	 exclaimed	 vexedly,	 "he	 had	 my	 address	 in	 the	 country,	 I should	have	been	saved	a	useless	visit	to	London!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He	 couldn't	 have	 let	 you	 know	 in	 time,	 for	 the	 matter	 was	 only	 settled	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p206"></a>morning." </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 a	 pause,	 and	 then	 the	 speaker	 added:	 "You	 will	 send	 in	 a	 minute	 of your	expenses,	of	course?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Panton	bowed	stiffly.	He	felt	that	he	had	been	badly	treated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	 sorry	 you	 have	 been	 put	 to	 this	 inconvenience,"	 and	 the	 courteous	 Home Office	official	really	did	look	distressed.	He	waited	a	moment.	"I	think	you	know a	friend	of	mine,	Miss	Blanche	Farrow,	Dr.	Panton?"	he	said	a	little	awkwardly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes;	we've	both	been	staying	in	the	same	house	for	the	New	Year." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Panton's	 good-humour	 had	 come	 back;	 he	 was	 telling	 himself,	 with	 some</p>
<p class="calibre1">amusement,	how	very	small	the	world	is,	after	all! </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 a	 pause,	 and	 then	 Panton	 asked:	 "Do	 you	 happen	 to	 know	 Lionel Varick,	who	owns	the	beautiful	house	where	Miss	Farrow	and	I	have	both	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">staying,	Mr.—er—?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gifford,"	supplied	the	other	quickly.	"Yes,	I	have	been	slightly	acquainted	with Mr.	Varick	for	some	years."	A	very	uncomfortable,	peculiar	look	came	over	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">speaker's	face.	"I	wonder	if	you	have	heard	of	the	terrible	thing	which	happened</p>
<p class="calibre1">yesterday	at	Wyndfell	Hall?"	he	asked	abruptly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	only	left	the	house	at	five	o'clock,"	exclaimed	Dr.	Panton;	and	then,	as	he	saw the	look	of	gravity	deepen	on	the	other	man's	face,	he	asked:	"Was	there	a	fire</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	last	night?	I	trust	not!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No,"	said	the	other,	slowly,	"nothing	has	happened	to	the	house,	Dr.	Panton.	But your	friend	Mr.	Varick	is	dead.	He	went	out	for	a	walk	in	the	dark,	and	seems	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	slipped	over	the	side	of	an	embankment	into	deep	water.	His	body	was	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">recovered	for	some	hours—in	fact,	not	till	early	this	morning." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	 Panton	 got	 up	 from	 the	 chair	 on	 which	 he	 had	 been	 sitting.	 He	 was	 too shocked,	too	taken	aback,	to	speak,	and	the	other	went	on:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 cannot	 give	 you	 many	 details,	 for	 when	 Miss	 Farrow	 telephoned	 to	 me	 she was	very	much	upset,	and	the	line	was	very	bad.	But	I	may	add	that	there	is	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">doubt	about	it,	for	the	news	was	confirmed,	through	another	source,	half	an	hour</p>
<p class="calibre1">later." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	a	terrible	thing!	What	an	awful—awful	thing!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p207"></a>The	 young	 doctor	 looked	 overwhelmed	 with	 horror	 and	 surprise.	 "You	 must forgive	 me,"	 he	 went	 on,	 "if	 I	 seem	 unduly	 shocked;	 but	 I	 have	 lost	 in	 Lionel Varick	one	of	the	best	friends	man	ever	had,	Mr.	Gifford—I'd	have	sold	the	shirt</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	my	back	for	him	and	I	think	I	may	say	he'd	have	done	the	same	for	me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mark	Gifford,	cautious	man	though	he	was,	took	a	sudden	resolution.	"If	you	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">spare	 the	 time,"	 he	 exclaimed,	 "I	 wonder,	 Dr.	 Panton,	 if	 you	 would	 go	 back	 to Wyndfell	Hall	to-day?	It	would	be	an	act	of	true	kindness	to	Miss	Farrow.	I	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought	of	going	myself;	but,	as	you	seem	to	have	been	such	a	friend	of	Varick's</p>
<p class="calibre1">—?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	 course	 I'll	 go	 down—by	 the	 very	 first	 train	 I	 can	 catch!"	 answered	 Panton eagerly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Perhaps	 you	 could	 persuade	 Miss	 Farrow	 to	 come	 up	 to	 London	 at	 once,	 and leave	all	the	sad	details	connected	with	the	inquest,	and	so	on,	to	you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 will	 indeed!	 Miss	 Farrow	 must	 be	 terribly	 distressed,	 for	 I	 know	 she	 was	 a very,	very	close	friend	of	poor	Varick's." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mark	Gifford	winced—it	was	a	very	slight	movement,	quite	unperceived	by	Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Panton. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	the	surprise	of	his	subordinates,	who	had	never	seen	him	do	so	much	honour</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 any	 male	 visitor	 before,	 Mr.	 Gifford	 accompanied	 the	 young	 medical	 man</p>
<p class="calibre1">along	the	corridor,	down	the	stone	staircase,	and	through	to	the	great	outer	arch</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	gives	on	to	the	quiet	street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	moment	of	their	final	parting	Dr.	Panton	exclaimed:	"Am	I	to	understand</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	Dr.	Spiller	will	not	be	sending	for	me	again?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	thought	I	had	made	it	clear,"	replied	Mr.	Gifford	mildly,	"that	the	matter	about which	he	wished	to	see	you	is	now	closed." </p>
