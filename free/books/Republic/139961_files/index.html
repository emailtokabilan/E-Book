<p class="calibre1">Author’s	Note	and	Acknowledgements</p>
<p class="calibre1">On	April	19,	1995,	a	bomb	made	of	improvised	materials	was	detonated	in	front of	the	Alfred	P.	Murrah	Federal	Building	by	a	young	Gulf	War	veteran	named Timothy	McVeigh.	The	bombing,	one	of	the	first	major	terrorist	incidents	on American	soil,	killed	168	people,	including	nineteen	children	and	three	pregnant women.	The	youngest	victim	was	only	three	months	old. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	years	after	the	bombing	I	was	obsessed	with	the	question:	how	could	a	man who	had	honorably	served	his	country	in	wartime	become	a	terrorist?	What sequence	of	events	led	McVeigh	and	his	co-conspirators	to	conclude	that	the only	solution	was	to	launch	a	murderous	attack	killing	hundreds	of	people? </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	there	the	question	naturally	arose:	what	circumstances	in	our	modern	era could	bring	about	a	massive	domestic	terror	campaign,	or	an	actual	civil	war? </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	novel	arises	from	those	questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Much	of	the	original	manuscript	was	complete	by	the	time	the	September	11, 2001	attacks	occurred.	The	response	of	the	federal	government	provided	much of	the	fodder	for	a	rewrite,	especially	the	creation	of	the	massive	federal bureaucracy	known	as	the	Department	of	Homeland	Security.	The	passage	of	the Patriot	Act,	the	rumors	of	an	even	stricter	one	which	included	provisions	to	strip</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a>Americans	of	their	citizenship,	domestic	spying	scandals,	accusations	of	rigged voting	machines	and	moves	by	Congress	to	consider	the	repeal	of	 <i class="calibre3">Posse</i> <i class="calibre3">Comitatus</i>	have	all	provided	ideas	and	fears	which	fed	this	book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Please	note,	however,	that	while	I	make	reference	to	many	of	these developments	in	the	book,	this	is	indeed	a	fictional	world.	In	some	cases	I’ve strayed	significantly	from	current	practice	and	law	for	dramatic	purposes.	I	make no	apology	for	this.	In	other	cases—particularly	the	use	of	torture	for	terror suspects—I	haven’t	touched	on	here,	simply	because	it	didn’t	make	sense	in	the context	of	the	story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	while	this	is	a	fictional	world,	perhaps	ten	years	in	our	future,	it	is	also	the world	we	might	one	day	live	in.	In	a	civil	war,	each	side	believes	it	is	right.	The real	danger	we	face,	as	individuals	and	as	a	nation,	is	of	becoming	so	convinced that	our	own	point	of	view	is	the	correct	one	that	we	become	unable	to	listen	to anyone	else’s.	It	is	not	an	accident	that	much	of	rhetoric	I	read	in	blogs,	from both	the	left	and	right,	mirrors	in	tone	and	in	some	content	the	speeches, newspapers,	and	pamphlets	of	the	early	1860’s,	prior	to	beginning	of	the	Civil War	that	killed	more	than	one	million	Americans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	we	talk	about	red	and	blue,	fascists	and	traitors,	but	the	words	mean	the same	thing—_those	people_.	Those	other	people,	who	we	don’t	understand,	and who	we	believe	don’t	have	the	best	interest	of	our	country	in	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	is	a	novel	of	people	fighting	a	war	against	each	other,	all	the	while believing	that	they	are	the	ones	fighting	for	our	liberty	and	our	country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	you	enjoy	this	book,	please	take	the	time	to	post	a	review	online	or	to	tell	a friend	about	it.	Word	of	mouth—from	one	reader	to	another—is	what	makes books	successful	or	not.

<p class="calibre1">A	book	like	this	requires	a	lot	of	help	from	a	lot	of	people.	In	particular,	I’d	like to	thank	my	tireless	editor,	Shakirah	Dawud,	who	helped	me	reshape	this	into	a much	better	novel	than	it	otherwise	could	have	been.	Also	Paul	Sullivan,	Donna Price,	Helen	DeRamus,	Richard	Miles	and	Rhonda	Miles	for	reading	early	drafts and	sending	me	valuable	feedback.	Any	oversights	and	mistakes	present	in	the current	volume	are	my	fault,	not	theirs. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>Finally,	thank	you	to	Veronica,	Khalil	and	Amirah	for	putting	up	with	me	being distracted	for	long	hours	while	I	thought	about	the	story,	and	the	many	hours	you sacrificed	so	I	could	work	on	it. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">April	14</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Martha	Murphy	walked	her	son	to	his	teacher	and	kissed	him	goodbye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kenny	shook	away,	in	a	hurry	to	get	into	the	classroom	so	he	could	play	with	the computer	before	the	day	officially	started.	One	step	away	from	her	he	stumbled, arms	and	legs	splayed	out.	A	keening	wail	rose	from	the	boy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	honey.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lifting	her	son,	she	examined	him.	His	hands	were	scraped	red,	and	he	inhaled great	shuddering	gasps	that	expanded	his	cheeks.	His	green	t-shirt	and	blue	jeans were	a	little	scuffed,	but	nothing	serious.	Even	so,	his	blue	eyes	started	to	water, and	the	lower	lip	puffed	out,	the	preliminaries	of	an	explosion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There,	there,”	she	said.	“No	permanent	harm	done.	Do	you	still	have	all	your fingers	and	toes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	nodded.	His	eyes,	wide	and	wet	with	tears,	focused	on	his	mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	there	any	big	gobs	of	blood?	Any	serious	injuries?	You’ve	still	got	all	your head,	right?”	She	gently	tapped	on	the	side	of	his	head	as	she	spoke	the	last words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	time,	he	giggled	as	he	responded	with	a	shake	of	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right	then,	you	better	get	inside	if	you’re	going	to	have	time	to	play	with	the computer.	I’ll	see	you	tonight,	chickpea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kenny	didn’t	hesitate.	If	he	arrived	at	school	early	enough,	his	teacher	let	him play	on	the	computer	until	the	other	kids	arrived.	This	time	he	didn’t	trip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Hayes,	his	teacher,	put	her	hand	up	in	the	doorway,	and	said,	“Martha,	I wonder	if	you	could	find	the	time	for	a	bit	of	a	talk	this	week.	We’ve	got	some concerns	about	little	Kenny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>“Of	course.	Is	something	wrong?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Naw,	nothing	like	that.	But,	well…we’ve	been	a	mite	concerned	about	his development.	Not	saying	anything’s	wrong,	but	it’s	always	best	to	check	these things	out	early.	We	can	talk	in	detail.	How	about	tomorrow,	at	three?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	be	there.	Should	I	bring	Ken?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lord,	no.	It’s	nothing	serious,	Martha.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Martha	nodded,	then	headed	away.  <i class="calibre3">Worried	about	his	development. </i>	There	was nothing	wrong	with	Kenny,	he	was	doing	just	fine.	She	would	meet	with	them, and	find	out	what	the	worry	was.	Probably	because	he	was	a	boy,	and	he	acted like	a	boy,	and	these	days	that	in	itself	was	sometimes	treated	as	a	behavior problem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back	at	the	pickup,	she	squeezed	herself	into	the	driver’s	seat,	and	then	took	a couple	of	deep	breaths.	Winded	from	walking	thirty	feet.	Well,	this	was	her	third pregnancy,	and	certainly	the	last.	Only	three	months	to	go.	She	was	so	stiff,	and really	too	old	to	be	having	another	baby.	Kenny	had	come	and	slept	in	her	and Ken’s	bed	again,	too,	sometime	after	midnight,	which	had	meant	a	whole	night of	tossing	and	turning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Martha	and	her	husband	Ken	had	debated	at	length	about	whether	to	go	ahead with	the	pregnancy.	Their	daughter	Valerie,	born	when	Martha	was	just	eighteen years	old,	was	twenty-two	now,	starting	her	first	job	as	a	congressional	aide	to congressman	Al	Clark.	Valerie	was	a	stern	young	woman,	ambitious	and aggressive.	Martha	was	simultaneously	proud	of	her	daughter’s accomplishments,	and—at	least	sometimes—secretly	ashamed	to	think	Valerie was	cold.	But	facts	were	facts.	She	had	certainly	never	let	anything	as	silly	as	a boy	get	in	the	way	of	her	career,	but	that	was	the	way	you	were	supposed	to	be these	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	had	been	an	only	child.	Then	Kenny	came	along	like	a	shock	to	the system,	and	suddenly	a	newly	adult	woman	an	infant	brother.	Valerie	took	it easier	than	either	of	her	parents,	who	had	long	ago	forgotten	the	sleepless	nights and	stress	attendant	with	being	a	new	parent.	Now	they	were	doing	it	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ken,	stoic	as	always,	struggled	over	the	pregnancy,	then	announced	that	he would	support	whatever	decision	she	wanted	to	make.	She	knew	he	wanted	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>baby,	desperately.	It	cost	him	a	lot	to	hold	himself	back	and	let	Martha	explore her	emotions	about	having	another	baby	in	her	forties.	But	in	the	end,	there wasn’t	really	any	question	about	what	she	would	do.	Now,	the	questions	all centered	on	the	baby’s	health.	The	doctors	were	able	to	tell	a	lot,	and	she	had been	having	the	full	range	of	tests	since	early	in	the	pregnancy.	She	told	herself that	if	anything	serious	were	wrong,	they	would	know	by	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	the	same,	sometimes	she	was	frightened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	phone	rang	as	she	cranked	the	engine.	With	a	glance	at	the	phone—it	was Valerie—she	put	the	headset	behind	her	ear	and	clicked	the	talk	button. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi,	Valerie!”	she	said,	backing	out	of	her	parking	space. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi,	Mom.	I	just	wanted	to	let	you	know	I	 <i class="calibre3">will</i>	be	able	to	make	it	next	weekend; I	got	Friday	off.	What	do	you	think	Kenny	will	want	for	a	present?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Martha	looked	both	ways	at	the	traffic	on	Route	340.	Traffic	was	picking	up,	and over	the	years,	this	had	become	a	dangerous	intersection.	The	heaviest	fog	had lifted,	but	patches	still	limited	visibility	and	gave	the	morning	a	grey,	forlorn cast.	A	fat	raindrop	streaked	the	windshield.	One	more	stop	to	make,	at	Haggett’s Mart	a	couple	miles	down,	then	she	could	head	into	town. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	your	best	bet	are	some	Ranger	Heroes,	he’s	been	playing	with	those	a lot.	You	can	ask	about	them	at	the	toy	store.	Just	a	small	one,	not	one	of	the	big sets—we’re	having	some	of	his	classmates	over	for	the	party,	so	I	expect	there will	be	too	many	presents	as	it	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,	Mom.	How	are	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I’m	as	big	as	a	house.	It’s	getting	to	where	I	have	to	ask	Mr.	Chapman next	door	for	help	whenever	I	need	to	do	any	lifting	at	the	shop.	And	he’s moving	along	in	age	himself—I	expect	one	of	these	days	I’ll	have	him	keeled over	on	the	floor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	laughed.	“You’ve	always	charmed	the	guys,	Mom.	How’s	the	store?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,	good!	About	three	weeks	ago	they	had	some	shindig	in	Harpers	Ferry	for some	diplomat,	a	Russian	I	think,	and	they	came	into	the	shop	and	bought	every flower	I	had!	They	cleaned	us	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>“That’s	wonderful!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	she	was	talking,	Martha	came	to	the	turnoff	for	the	small	convenience	store. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Valerie,	I’ve	got	to	get	going.	Can	we	talk	tonight?”	she	said	as	she	made	a	left into	the	parking	lot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.	I	love	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Martha	clicked	the	“Talk”	button	and	heard	silence.	She	took	off	the	earpiece and	slowly	climbed	out	of	the	truck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haggett’s	Mart	could	only	charitably	be	called	a	shack,	an	old,	clapboard building	that	had	been	whitewashed	sometime	in	the	last	couple	of	decades.	A single	cracked	but	clean	window	was	crowded	with	tin	cans	and	a	broken	neon sign.	The	parking	lot,	once	paved,	had	degenerated	to	mostly	gravel	and	broken pavement,	and	the	gas	pumps	in	front	had	not	operated	in	decades.	The	store	still did	thriving	business,	however.	The	chain	gas	station	across	town,	though	clean, well	lit,	and	with	lower	prices,	wasn’t	a	place	to	find	gossip,	and	it	wasn’t	locally owned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	she	walked	toward	the	door	she	glanced	at	the	headlines	on	the	newspapers out	front.	All	of	them	were	variations	on	the	same	theme:	“DHS	Raids Compound	in	Maine,”	or	“Two	Agents	Killed	in	Gun	Raid.”	The	 <i class="calibre3">Post</i>	was dominated	by	a	photo	of	a	wounded	DHS	agent	in	full	battle	gear,	a	hint	of	blood on	his	black	uniform. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	news	had	been	all	over	since	yesterday:	a	team	of	agents	from	the Department	of	Homeland	Security	had	raided	a	compound	in	rural	Maine.	A	gun battle	ensued,	killing	two	agents	and	seven	of	the	suspected	terrorists.	The	other suspects	were	in	custody	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Martha	opened	the	door	and	waved	to	the	cantankerous	old	man	with	thinning white	hair	and	a	face	full	of	deep	creases	and	wrinkles	sitting	behind	the cluttered	counter.	Walter	Haggett	was	pushing	ninety,	but	looked	seventy.	He still	ran	his	own	store,	and	knew	just	about	everyone	in	Highview.	Walter	was usually	good	for	an	interesting	story	or	two	about	goings-on	in	town,	which accounted	for	the	popularity	of	his	store.	Certainly	the	décor	didn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	morning,	Martha.	How’s	the	flower	business?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>“Just	fine,	Walter.	How	is	the	convenience	business?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	if	I	get	any	older,	it	won’t	be	very	convenient	for	me.”	He	laughed	out loud.	The	joke	wasn’t	all	that	funny,	but	he	said	it	the	same	way	nearly	every day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	fresh	decaf	made,	Martha.	But	there’s	a	price.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	talk	to	that	husband	of	yours,	ask	him	to	find	me	a	place	in	his	battalion.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walter	was	a	Vietnam	veteran,	and	liked	to	kid	Ken	about	the	computerized monstrosities	his	National	Guard	battalion	was	equipped	with. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Martha	smiled	at	the	old	man.	“I’ll	talk	to	him,	Walter,	but	I’m	pretty	sure	you’re past	the	enlistment	age.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haggett	pursed	his	lips.	“I’m	pretty	sure	I	was	past	the	enlistment	age	forty	years ago,	young	lady.	Rules	are	for	Yankees	and	lawyers.	You	talk	to	the	Colonel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed	and	nodded,	and	said,	“I	will,	but	you	have	to	promise	to	let	me bring	some	flowers	from	the	shop	when	we	get	some	new	shipments.	Liven	the place	up	a	bit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Flowers! </i>	What	do	I	need	flowers	for?	Be	useless	as	teats	on	a	boar	hog.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed	and	walked	through	the	cramped	aisle	to	the	back	of	the	store; poured	herself	some	decaf,	looking	longingly	at	the	regular	coffee.	As	she	fixed her	cup,	she	patted	her	stomach.	Only	three	months	to	go,	she	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bell	at	the	front	door	rang	as	she	stirred	the	sugar	and	cream	in	her	coffee, and	someone	muttered	something	up	at	the	counter.	She	turned	and	walked	back to	the	front,	then	stopped	and	gasped	when	she	saw	the	man	with	the	gun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	unfamiliar	man—boy,	really—was	rail	thin,	in	ill	fitting,	tattered	clothes, with	dirty	shoulder-length	hair.	His	face	was	gaunt,	with	eyes	that	stared	out from	darkened	sockets.	His	right	hand,	holding	a	pistol,	shook. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,	old	man,	just	give	me	the	money,”	the	man	said.	As	he	spoke,	his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>whole	body	shuddered.  <i class="calibre3">Drug	addict, </i>	Martha	thought,  <i class="calibre3">Or	he’s	really	sick. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Walter	grimaced.	“All	right,	don’t	get	your	panties	in	a	wad,”	he	said,	working the	register.	His	eyes	darted	to	Martha,	then	to	something	below	the	register. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	a	smooth,	quick	motion,	he	reached	beneath	it	and	lifted	a	shotgun	to	his shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wasn’t	quick	enough.	The	young	man	fired	twice,	the	explosions	rocking	the tiny	store.	Walter	fell	backward	in	a	shower	of	blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Martha	shrieked,	her	hand	rising	to	her	mouth,	and	the	man	jumped	and	fired again,	the	muzzle	blast	bright	in	her	face.	She	fell	backward	as	if	a	truck	had	hit her;	her	head	hit	the	floor	with	a	loud	crack.	Dazed,	she	lay	there	as	the	man stepped	over	her,	reaching	behind	the	counter.	Then	he	ran	for	the	front	door	and out	into	the	fog,	leaving	behind	the	sound	of	the	bell	ringing	over	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	vision	was	dark,	pinpointed,	as	if	she	was	looking	out	from	a	dark	puddle	of water.	Slowly,	she	rested	her	hand	on	her	stomach	and	felt	a	mass	of	blood	and torn	flesh.	As	the	blood	flowed	from	between	her	fingers,	she	began	to	feel	the pain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	my	God,	my	baby.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	phone.	Despite	the	pain,	she	struggled	for	her	purse	as	bright	red	blood washed	across	the	dirty	linoleum	floor.	Where	was	the	damn	phone?	The	purse fell	open,	pens	and	her	checkbook	spilling	out	onto	the	floor.	There	was	her pistol,	which	Ken	insisted	she	carry.	Lot	of	good	it	did	now	that	she	really needed	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	phone.  <i class="calibre3">Must	have	left	it	in	the	car. </i>	She	fell	back	in	exhaustion,	waves	of	pain wracking	her	body,	a	fog	clouding	her	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	about	Kenny?	Who	was	going	to	pick	him	up	from	school? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Martha	stared	up	at	the	ceiling,	thinking	of	her	little	boy,	and	his	father	whom she’d	loved	for	more	than	twenty	years.	She	started	to	drift	away	into	the darkness.	A	vision	of	dancing	with	him	at	their	junior	prom	a	lifetime	ago	came unbidden	to	her	mind’s	eye.	He’d	worn	a	white	tuxedo,	and	had	given	her	a matching	orchid.	Now	when	she	thought	of	him	dressed	up,	it	was	always	in	his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>dress	blues,	with	the	yellow	piping	of	an	Armor	officer. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Ken—what	will	you	do	when	I’m	gone?	Oh,	I	love	you. </i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Kenny	Murphy,	Jr.	waved	goodbye	and	turned	to	go	into	the	school	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	faint	lines	at	the	corners	of	Ken	Murphy’s	eyes	crinkled	just	a	little	as	he watched	the	little	blonde	boy	walk	away.	He’d	changed	so	much	that	Martha wouldn’t	have	recognized	him	if	she’d	still	been	alive.	A	very	serious	boy,	he had	problems	they’d	never	imagined	when	he	was	just	three,	problems	Murphy felt	ill-equipped	to	deal	with	by	himself,	even	three	years	after	she’d	died. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	got	back	on	340	moments	later,	hands	tapping	impatiently	on	the	steering wheel	as	the	slow	moving	traffic	crept	up	the	four-lane	highway.	At	least	he	had an	automatic	shift	now;	the	clutch	in	his	old	truck	hadn’t	agreed	with	the prosthetic	he’d	worn	since	Iraq.	His	eyes	glanced	off	the	wedding	ring	on	his	left hand,	then	back	to	the	congested	road.	Brake	lights	flashed	in	the	heavy	fog. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	hated	foggy	mornings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he’d	first	moved	to	Highview	with	Martha	back	at	the	turn	of	the	century, the	town	had	less	than	five	hundred	residents.	There	were	at	least	four	times	as many	now,	and	the	rest	of	the	county	had	grown	even	more,	with	thousands	who commuted	all	the	way	to	Baltimore	and	Washington,	DC.	Traffic	got	worse	all the	time;	what	had	once	been	a	five-minute	drive	to	work	had	turned	into	twenty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	grimaced	as	he	pulled	into	the	plant.	A	new	fence	had	been	under construction	for	some	weeks.	Security,	said	the	executives.	Hadn’t	been	any need	for	a	fence	in	the	last	twenty	years,	and	he	didn’t	see	the	need	for	one	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Waste	of	money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	parked	the	pickup	in	his	reserved	spot	near	the	entrance	to	the	building.	A small	hybrid	pulled	in	next	to	him,	in	the	spot	reserved	for	the	employee	of	the month.	Karen	Greenfield.	A	little	older	than	his	daughter,	Greenfield	was	a	rising star	at	the	plant,	and	one	hell	of	a	leader.	He	knew	her	well	from	the	National Guard.	She	was	a	company	commander	in	his	battalion,	confident	and	assertive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Attractive	young	lady,	too;	every	junior	officer	in	the	battalion,	plus	most	of	the men	at	the	plant,	had	tried	at	least	once	to	get	her	to	go	out	on	a	date.	They	rarely tried	more	than	once—when	provoked,	her	eyes	could	blister	enough	to	crack your	skin.	Like	Murphy,	Karen	wore	stout	jeans	and	a	casual	shirt. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>“Morning,	Colonel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Morning,	Karen.	You	can	call	me	Ken	when	we’re	not	on	drill.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled.	“If	I	did,	I’d	be	the	only	person	around	here	who	did.	Any	word	on what’s	going	on	in	Vienna?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shook	his	head.	The	day	before,	his	boss,	plant	manager	and	vice	president	of production,	had	been	called	to	northern	Virginia	for	a	meeting	of	the	executives that	was	supposed	to	be	secret.	Nothing	stayed	secret	around	here.	The	rumors said	they	were	considering	layoffs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	nothing.	I	wouldn’t	worry	too	much.	We’re	one	of	the	most	profitable	units in	the	company.	They’d	be	fools	to	mess	with	a	good	thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	smiled	as	they	walked	toward	the	entrance	of	the	plant.	“There’s	no shortage	of	fools	in	the	world,	Colonel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	suppose	you’re	right.	Nothing	to	be	done	for	it	now,	though.	We’ve	got	to	get those	bugs	worked	out	of	the	new	run.	Best	to	think	about	that	instead	of rumors.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	entered	the	building	and	she	headed	off	to	her	office,	while	he	went	to	his. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	the	confident	front,	Murphy	was	worried.	The	fence	was	just	part	of	it: spending	thousands	of	dollars	on	security	for	a	building	that	had	never	suffered	a breakin?	It	was	a	very	visible	reminder	that	the	company	was	changing,	and quickly,	since	it	had	been	bought	by	Nelson	Barclay’s	Vienna	Holdings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barclay	had	a	nasty	reputation	in	the	high-tech	industry.	An	incredibly	wealthy man,	he’d	built	his	company	by	gobbling	up	smaller	competitors,	and	avoided regulators	by	keeping	plenty	of	campaign	dollars	flowing	into	the	right	pockets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	a	good	friend	of	President	Price,	which	didn’t	do	him	any	good	in Murphy’s	eyes.	Murphy	had	voted	for	Price’s	opponent,	a	struggling	underdog who’d	been	trounced	in	the	election. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	walked	past	his	assistant’s	desk	and	into	his	small	office.	Like	most	of the	rest	of	the	plant’s	workers,	she	wouldn’t	be	in	for	another	hour.	Murphy’s habit,	for	more	than	a	decade,	had	been	to	get	to	the	office	at	least	an	hour	or	two earlier	than	the	rest	of	the	shift.	Without	interruptions,	he	was	usually	able	to	get more	done	then	than	he	did	during	the	rest	of	the	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>Every	detail	of	the	office	was	organized.	His	desk,	usually	clear	of	everything but	the	framed	photograph	of	Martha,	was	currently	stacked	with	the	reports	that had	been	rushed	through	yesterday	for	the	executive	meeting.	Like	the	fence,	the reports,	describing	the	efficiency	of	the	plant	and	its	workers,	made	him	uneasy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	showed	a	solid	profit,	but	Murphy	wondered	if	it	was	enough	to	satisfy Barclay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’d	know	soon	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	morning	was	apparently	soon	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	new	twenty-foot	high	chain	link	fence	surrounded	the	plant,	topped	with razor	wire.	Raw	earth	was	exposed	where	the	posts	had	been	buried.	New security	cameras	mounted	on	the	high	fence	posts	pointed	at	the	roadway	and	the gate.	The	gate	was	locked	tight	with	a	chain	and	padlock,	and	unfamiliar	security guards	stood	outside	the	door	of	the	plant,	well	inside	the	grounds	behind	the gate.	A	brightly	painted	sign	hung	on	the	fence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Effective	immediately,	the	Saturn	Microsystems	Harpers	Ferry	Plant	is	closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Personal	items	and	severance	pay	will	be	mailed	to	all	employees	on	completion of	inventory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	climbed	out	of	the	car	where	he	had	parked	it	off	the	side	of	the	long drive	leading	to	the	gate,	his	lips	curled	into	a	frown.	Karen	Greenfield	stood next	to	her	rusted	pickup	across	the	drive,	slapping	at	the	buzzing	insects swarming	around	them.	She	looked	at	him,	the	query	in	her	eyes	clear	enough that	she	didn’t	have	to	say	a	word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wiped	sweat	from	his	forehead	and	stared	at	the	sign	and	the	fence	in disbelief.	He	was	Director	of	Operations	at	the	plant,	the	number-two	man,	and he’d	gotten	no	word.	Why	the	hell	had	they	done	this? </p>
<p class="calibre1">More	cars	drove	up	the	treelined	drive	to	the	plant	and	parked	on	the	gravel	next to	the	drive,	and	a	small	crowd	formed	at	the	gate.	He’d	known	all	these	men and	women	for	two	decades.	He’d	worked	with	them	and	seen	them	around town.	Now	they	all	wore	the	same	puzzled	look.	No	anger	had	surfaced	yet,	but that	would	come.	In	singles	and	pairs,	they	approached	him	for	guidance	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>information.	He	had	nothing	to	give	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">David	Firkus	stepped	out	of	the	passenger	side	of	an	electric	van	and	walked toward	Murphy	and	Karen.	David’s	expression	carried	a	noticeable	lack	of	focus that	made	him	seem	younger	than	his	thirty-five	years,	with	the	mannerisms	and speech	patterns	of	a	ten	year	old.	Mildly	retarded,	David	had	worked	at	the	plant for	several	years.	As	always,	he	smiled	when	he	saw	Karen;	he’d	had	a	crush	on her	for	a	long	time.	She	returned	a	reassuring	smile.	David	was	one	of	the	few men	in	Highview	who	hadn’t	found	himself	wanting	to	crawl	away	in	response to	a	cutting	glance	from	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	surveyed	the	growing	crowd	as	Karen	tried	to	explain	to	David	what had	happened.	David	started	to	look	confused	and	upset	as	she	spoke	quickly	in a	low	contralto.	He	didn’t	understand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	didn’t	either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	seven,	the	crowd	had	swelled	to	hundreds	of	men	and	women,	including some	from	other	shifts:	the	word	had	spread.	They	talked	in	low	murmurs, bunched	in	small	groups. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy’s	eyes	darted	upward	when	he	heard	a	helicopter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	ripple	of	voices	surged	through	the	crowd	as	a	helicopter	with	the	“blue	blob” </p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	Saturn	Microsystems	logo	on	its	sides	appeared	over	the	trees.	It	landed	in the	parking	lot	where	their	cars	should	have	been,	and	two	men	jumped	to	the ground	and	approached	the	gate.	Murphy’s	boss,	in	a	suit	and	tie,	carried	a megaphone.	He	must	have	come	from	corporate	headquarters:	no	one	wore	a	suit at	the	plant.	The	other	man	wore	the	West	Virginia	State	Police	uniform.	Murphy heard	the	indignation	of	the	men	and	women	behind	him.	Why	did	he	bring	a state	patrolman	with	him?	Was	he	afraid	of	them? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	crowd	fell	silent	as	the	two	men	approached	the	other	side	of	the	fence,	but the	tension	remained—a	tension	Murphy	didn’t	like	at	all.	Take	away	people’s livelihood	all	of	a	sudden,	and	there	was	no	telling	how	they	would	react. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy’s	boss’s	eyes	met	Murphy’s,	then	looked	away.	No	answers	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	plant	manager	raised	the	megaphone	to	his	lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Folks,	I	can’t	even	begin	to	tell	you	how	sorry	I	am.	You	know	that	for	the	past</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>couple	of	days	I’ve	been	in	Vienna	for	a	meeting	with	Mr.	Barclay.	There	isn’t any	way	to	break	this	easily,	so	I’m	just	going	to	lay	it	out.	All	three	of	Saturn’s US-based	plants	closed	this	morning.	Everyone	is	laid	off,	effective immediately.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	angry	roar	rose	from	the	crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hold	on	a	minute,”	he	yelled	into	the	megaphone.	“Let	me	have	my	say,	please. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	will	hit	me	just	as	hard	as	all	of	you.	There’s	nothing	we	can	do.	The	board decided	this	months	ago,	and	a	new	plant	in	Jakarta	opened	today.	Now	listen	to me.	The	company	is	making	a…a	generous	offer…of	new	positions	for	some	of you.	If	you	accept	the	offer	you’ll	have	the	same	seniority	you	have	now.	The company	will	even	pay	your	relocation	expenses,	and	there	is	a	good	English school	near	the	new	plant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	in	the	crowd	shouted,	“Where	the	hell	is	Jakarta?	We’re	Americans!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	yell,	“How	much	is	the	pay	cut?	What	will	they	pay	us	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	this	how	you	saved	your	job,	you	bastard?	You	sold	us	out	to	some	other country?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	plant	manager	frowned,	and	then	spoke	again,	his	voice	shaking,	barely audible	even	with	the	megaphone.	“I	didn’t	save	my	job—I	can’t	move	to Indonesia.	I’m	staying	on	to	supervise	shipping	out	all	the	equipment,	then they’re	letting	me	go,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Liar!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Folks,	listen	to	me.	You	have	to	keep	your	cool	on	this.	Next	week,	checks	will go	out	to	everyone	for	six	weeks’	severance	pay,	plus	extra	depending	on	how long	you	worked	for	the	company.	Also,	for	some	of	you	there	will	be	an enclosed	job	offer	at	the	new	plant,	with	the	new	salary,	doing	the	same	job	you have	today.	The	company	will	pick	up	moving	expenses.	This	is	a	generous offer.	All	the	details	on	the	move	will	be	in	the	information	packet.	Now	please. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Go	home.	Go	back	to	your	families	and	try	to	figure	out	what	is	the	best	move for	you,	all	right?	I’m	sorry,	I	wish	I	had	better	news,	I	really	do.	Goodbye.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shook	his	head	and	walked	away,	the	state	trooper	following. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>Someone	pitched	a	glass	bottle,	the	sun	glinting	off	the	glass	as	it	spun	end	over end	before	shattering	against	the	fence	and	showering	the	two	men	with	broken glass.	The	trooper	spun	around	and	fumbled	for	his	pistol,	and	someone	in	the crowd	shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	backed	away	from	the	fence.	Half	a	dozen	men	stood	on	the	hoods	of two	trucks,	shouting	at	the	plant	manager’s	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	said	in	a	tone	he	expected	to	be	obeyed,	“Captain	Greenfield.”	He motioned	to	Karen	and	they	grabbed	David	by	the	arms.	Murphy	hadn’t	been	in an	angry	crowd	like	this	since	Iraq,	and	didn’t	want	to	be	in	one	now.	This	could get	ugly	real	quick,	and	David	didn’t	need	to	be	in	the	middle	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,	Dave,	let’s	get	away	from	the	gate,”	Karen	said.	She	smiled	at	him, attempting	to	keep	him	calm	even	as	the	crowd	grew	more	raucous.	They	pulled him	away	from	the	gate,	toward	the	woods	beside	the	road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">David	said,	“What’s	going	on,	I	don’t	understand!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	bottle	bounced	against	the	fence,	then	shattered	against	the	pavement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	workers	started	to	climb	the	chain	links. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	you’re	going	to	have	to	get	down,”	shouted	the	state	trooper.	He	unhitched the	strap	over	his	pistol. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	pushed	against	the	surge	of	the	crowd,	trying	to	move	David	and	Karen out	of	it	as	screams	rang	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind	him,	Murphy	heard	a	gunshot	as	the	trooper	fired	into	the	air.	Murphy’s ears	rang,	and	David	screamed,	then	started	to	cry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	crowd	fell	back	from	the	fence,	as	if	from	the	crack	of	a	whip.	The	gunshot seemed	to	drain	the	angry	energy	from	the	crowd,	or	at	least	frighten	them enough	to	back	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	said,	“It’s	all	right,	Dave,”	and	hugged	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	on,”	the	trooper	yelled.	“Get	out	of	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">People	started	to	move	back	to	their	cars.	Much	more	quickly	than	the	area	had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>filled	this	morning,	it	began	to	empty.	Murphy	and	Karen	helped	David	back	to his	carpool	as	with	a	funereal	air,	the	former	employees	headed	back	to	their homes.	Murphy	looked	back	at	the	fence.	The	trooper	still	stood	behind	it, Murphy’s	boss	not	far	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	all	the	goodbye	he	got,	after	nineteen	years	with	the	company. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	at	Karen,	and	she	back	at	him,	both	of	them	helpless	to	do	anything about	the	situation.	Without	another	word,	they	got	back	in	their	cars	and	drove away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sally’s	Diner	in	Highview	was	as	busy	as	Murphy	had	ever	seen	it.	The	usual lunch	crowd	was	there	of	course,	but	the	place	was	packed	with	an	extra	twenty people	or	so:	folks	like	him,	who	would	have	normally	been	down	at	the	plant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	old	building,	with	its	rundown	interior	and	flaking	paint,	was	a	favorite meeting	spot	in	Highview.	On	the	corner	of	Main	and	Tipple	streets,	it	was	a small	standalone	building,	a	wood	frame	with	peeling	white	clapboards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	had	a	seat	at	the	scuffed	counter,	a	cup	of	coffee	set	before	him	and	an unread	 <i class="calibre3">Washington	Post</i>	next	to	it.	The	coffee	had	been	sitting,	getting	cold.	He absently	rubbed	the	joint	between	his	knee	and	the	prosthetic	left	leg	he’d	worn for	more	than	a	decade.	He	needed	to	get	some	new	liners;	it	had	been	irritating him	lately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walter	Haggett’s	teenage	great-grandson	Frank	frantically	washed	dishes	behind the	counter,	slinging	the	trays	of	dishes	and	glasses	around	with	a	crash.	Frank was	sixteen,	and	should	have	been	in	school;	he’d	dropped	out	earlier	in	the school	year.	It	was	hard	for	Murphy	to	see	the	gangly,	greasy-haired	teenager with	acne	and	rings	in	his	ears	and	nose:	he’d	been	a	confused	young	kid	at Haggett’s	funeral	three	years	earlier.	Walter	had	been	laid	to	rest	during	a	closed-coffin	service	the	day	after	Martha’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	Colonel	Murphy,	look	at	the	tube—isn’t	that	your	daughter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	looked	up	at	the	aging	television,	tuned	to	CNN.	Someone	turned	it	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">congressman	Al	Clark	stood	in	the	chamber	of	the	House	of	Representatives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Directly	behind	him	was	Murphy’s	daughter	Valerie,	Clark’s	assistant.	At	the bottom	of	the	screen	the	words	“Welfare	Reform	Bill”	flashed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>Clark	spoke,	a	lopsided	grin	on	his	face.	“The	wisdom—no,	the	celestial guidance—behind	this	proposal	is	almost	too	stellar	for	me	to	see	clearly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Applaud,	I	tell	you.	Applaud!	Now,	I	have	only	one	suggestion,	one	little	morsel</p>
<p class="calibre1">—an	amendment	to	offer	to	Mr.	Skaggs’s	wise	proposal.	Let	us	send	a	mission	to the	moon	to	carve	up	the	cheese	and	give	it	to	our	senior	citizens.	Let	us	send	it back	in	huge	rockets	to	land	in	the	ocean,	not	only	providing	for	our	dear	sainted grandmothers,	but	at	the	same	time	revitalizing	the	shipping	and	dairy industries.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	diners	in	the	restaurant	broke	into	laughter	as	the	screen	switched	to Representative	Mark	Skaggs	from	Kentucky,	his	face	flushed.	It	appeared	the other	representatives	onscreen	were	also	gripped	with	hysterical	laughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	suggestion	will	have	just	as	much	opportunity	to	help	our	country	as	the one	proposed	by	the	gentleman	from	Kentucky,”	Clark	said.	“Gentlemen, Ladies:	this	proposal	will	likely	bring	revolution	down	on	our	heads.	Our	people are	bleeding,	fellow	members	of	the	House.  <i class="calibre3">Bleeding. </i>	Yet	there	he	is,	the gentleman	from	Kentucky	who	wants	to	take	away	their	last	bandages	so	the wealthy	can	use	them	as	fancy	headdresses.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voices	rose	in	the	diner	again,	as	if	by	common	consent,	and	someone	turned	the volume	back	down	on	the	television	as	the	screen	shifted	back	to	the	anchors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	goings-on	in	Washington	had	little	to	do	with	them,	anyway.	If	it	hadn’t been	for	the	brief	view	of	Valerie	Murphy,	the	news	would	have	attracted	little interest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy’s	waitress	poured	him	a	cup	of	coffee	and	said,	“That	Clark,	he	sure	is	a card,	isn’t	he?	How’s	Valerie	doing	working	for	him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	loves	the	job,	got	promoted	again	last	year;	she’s	running	his	whole	office now,”	Murphy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	isn’t	that	something.	I	remember	when	she	was	nothing	more	than	a toddler,	thought	she	owned	everything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	some	things	never	change,”	he	said,	grinning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed	and	walked	away,	and	Murphy	returned	to	the	newspaper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Depressing	stuff.	Unemployment.	War	in	the	Middle	East.	Someone	had poisoned	the	reservoir	in	Milwaukee. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>Murphy	looked	away	from	the	paper	for	a	moment	and	his	eyes	landed	on	a couple	he	knew,	holding	hands	over	the	table	as	they	talked.	He	jerked	his	eyes away	and	returned	to	the	bad	news	in	the	paper.	Of	course	it	was	always	bad news—at	least	what	they	chose	to	print.	All	the	same,	lately	things	just	seemed to	be	getting	worse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	seat	taken?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	looked	up	at	the	words.	Karen	stood	to	his	left,	still	in	the	jeans	and flannel	shirt	she’d	worn	to	the	plant	earlier	in	the	morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sit	down,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	did,	apparently	unaware	of	the	appreciative	glances	from	the	men	across	the room.	Karen	didn’t	socialize	in	town	very	often. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	planning	to	do,	Colonel?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	first	I’m	going	to	ask	you	to	stop	calling	me	that	when	we’re	not	on	drill status.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled.	“Seriously.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	shrugged.	“Don’t	know.	I’ll	get	a	job	somewhere.	Kenny	can’t	go without	health	insurance.	But	I’ll	be	damned	if	I	know	what	to	do.	I’ve	been making	chips	at	that	plant	for	twenty	years.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded,	her	expression	serious.	“Yeah.	I’m	at	a	loss.	It’s	for	sure	there’s	no other	decent	jobs	around	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	tossed	back	the	rest	of	his	cold	coffee,	then	waved	to	the	waitress	for	a refill.	“Maybe	you	should	think	about	applying	for	active	duty	status.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	grunted.	“Maybe.	But	they’d	probably	make	me	switch	branches,	be	a	nurse or	finance	officer	or	something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	probably	right.	President	Price’s	predecessor	had	signed	an	executive order	integrating	women	who	applied	into	the	combat	arms,	and	Karen	had received	her	Armor	commission	as	a	result.	Then	Price	had	rescinded	the	order; consequently,	only	a	small	number	of	women	were	grandfathered	into	Infantry</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>and	Armor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	probably	right,”	he	said,	“But	they’d	be	fools	to	do	it.	Don’t	repeat	this, but	as	far	as	I’m	concerned,	you’re	the	most	capable	company	commander	I have.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	thank	you,	Colonel.	I	don’t	have	any	illusions	though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	I	could	talk	to	my	brother.	He	might	be	able	to	swing	something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	raised	her	eyebrows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tommy’s	taking	command	of	a	brigade	down	at	Fort	Campbell.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Infantry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	right.	West	Point.”	He	grinned.	“I	never	thought	my	little	brother	would outrank	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	believe	them	about	the	severance	pay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	imagine	so.	If	only	to	avoid	lawsuits,	they’ll	be	scrupulously	fair.	But	six weeks	pay	won’t	go	very	far.	Not	for	most	of	these	folks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	Definitely	not	for	me.	I’m	still	paying	off	my	damn	student	loans.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	went	to	Bowling	Green,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	right.	And	this	all	has	a	familiar	feeling.	I	grew	up	in	Kentucky	coal country.	When	they	finally	closed	the	mine	for	good,	it	seemed	like	the	town	was going	to	dry	up	and	blow	away.	A	lot	of	folks	never	recovered.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,”	he	replied.	“I	never	thought	I’d	be	facing	a	layoff	at	this	age.	Happened to	me	once,	a	lifetime	ago	it	seems.	I	got	laid	off	from	the	GM	plant	in	Atlanta twenty-five	years	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’d	you	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	laughed.	“Joined	the	Army.	All	I	had	was	a	high	school	diploma,	Martha,	and a	new	baby	to	feed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>He	looked	around	the	crowded	diner,	and	said,	“This	sure	is	going	to	hit Highview	hard.	Eight	hundred	families…I	guess	more	than	half	the	town	worked at	that	plant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	didn’t	finish	the	thought	aloud.	Desperate	people	tended	to	do	desperate things. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	Two</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">May	26</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	Murphy	hung	up	the	phone	and	finished	typing	her	notes.	Another	call from	Highview.	This	was	the	fifth	one	this	morning,	plus	the	long	talk	with	her father	last	night.	Folks	back	home	were	starting	to	panic.	A	tall,	well-dressed woman	with	a	sharp	mind,	she	knew	that	other	staffers	in	the	office—some	of whom	she’d	been	promoted	over—privately	called	her	a	bitch,	or	worse.	She didn’t	care.	Her	job	was	to	take	care	of	the	congressman,	and	that	meant	keeping the	office	running	efficiently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	pulled	the	file	together,	printed	her	notes	from	the	latest	call,	and	dialed	Al Clark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	ready,	Boss?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on	in.	Bring	Ambrose.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	minutes	later	she	and	Ambrose	Hall,	the	congressman’s	legal	counsel,	sat across	from	Clark	in	his	spacious	office.	Clark	briefly	switched	on	his	campaign smile;	then	switched	it	off,	moved	to	a	stuffed	leather	chair,	and	put	his	feet	on the	coffee	table.	He	wore	what	could	easily	be	called	the	Washington	uniform: dark	suit,	solid	blue	shirt	and	tie.	He	didn’t	often	pay	attention	to	his	appearance, and	had	been	wearing	the	same	ratty	shoes	he’d	worn	when	he’d	first	been elected.	One	of	these	days	she	was	going	to	make	them	disappear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ambrose	sat	next	to	her,	carefully	adjusting	his	well-tailored	suit.	Ambrose	was a	thin,	well-dressed	African	American	man	who	sported	a	rather	unusual handlebar	mustache.	He	was	also	gay—an	open	secret	no	one	cared	about	on	the Hill,	but	one	that	wouldn’t	go	over	that	well	back	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	what’s	the	story?”	Clark	asked,	struggling	out	of	his	coat.	The	office	was oppressively	hot:	like	much	of	everything	else,	funds	for	maintaining	the	aging House	office	buildings	had	been	cut.	Valerie’s	only	concession	to	the	heat	was	a lighter	suit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	short	on	details,”	she	said.	“Yesterday	morning,	Saturn	Microsystems</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>announced	it	was	closing	all	three	of	its	US-based	plants—Highview,	West Virginia;	Roswell,	Georgia	and	Phoenix,	Arizona.	They’re	moving	their	entire operation</p>
<p class="calibre1">offshore	to	Indonesia.	All	told,	about	three	thousand	people	were	laid	off, including	nearly	a	thousand	in	the	district.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	frowned.	“Sons	of	bitches.	Saturn	was	bought	out	by	Nelson	Barclay recently,	wasn’t	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	right.	The	company	is	profitable,	but	margins	have	been	falling	lately.	It was	the	last	chip	manufacturer	in	the	United	States.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jesus	Christ,”	Clark	said,	drawling	the	words	out	slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ambrose	creased	his	eyebrows	with	a	falsely	stern	look,	then	launched	into	his standard	lecture.	“Boss,	you’re	not	supposed	to	say	that.	Your	constituents	will take	a	dim	view.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	laughed.	“If	there’s	ever	a	time	to	swear,	it’s	now.	I’d	think	we’d	be	able	to get	the	folks	on	national	security	interested.	Aside	from	the	unemployment	issue, it’s	for	damn	sure	a	weakness	for	our	country	to	lose	its	only	ability	to	make high-tech	gear.	Are	they	at	least	giving	a	decent	severance	to	the	employees	who were	let	go?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	shook	her	head.	“Six	weeks,	plus	extra	for	seniority.	My	understanding	is that	final	checks	were	delivered	express	mail	to	folks	this	morning.	We’ve	had	a lot	of	calls—this	was	the	biggest	employer	in	the	district.	What	happens	to	those folks?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ambrose,	the	attorney,	said,	“Most	of	them	will	be	eligible	for	unemployment, but	we’ve	got	another	worry.	The	Skaggs	bill,	if	it	passes,	will	eliminate	most federal	benefits.	There	won’t	be	much	for	those	people	to	fall	back	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Same	story	all	over	the	country,”	Clark	replied.	“I	can’t	figure	out	why	the goddamn	bill	is	so	popular.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Boss…”	Valerie	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,	I	guess	Congressmen	aren’t	supposed	to	say	goddamn,	either.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>“It’s	true,	sir,”	Hall	said.	“It’s	bad	enough	you	have	a	gay	black	man	working	for you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,”	Clark	said,	shaking	his	head.	“Get	me	some	options,	folks.	I	don’t	know how	much	we	can	do,	but	we	can’t	let	this	one	slide.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	and	Ambrose	nodded,	and	then	stood.	As	she	walked	toward	the	door, Clark	said,	“Valerie,	doesn’t	your	father	work	for	Saturn?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	looked	back.	“He	did	until	yesterday,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	met	her	eyes	and	nodded.	“Find	me	some	options,	please.	Let’s	see	what we	can	do	to	help	those	folks	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back	at	her	desk	in	the	largest	cube	in	the	back	of	the	office,	Valerie	lost	herself in	her	work.	A	series	of	calls	to	the	much	reduced	labor	department	produced	no result	but	frustration.	On	top	of	that,	a	series	of	visitors	were	coming	this afternoon.	Representatives	of	the	United	Mine	Workers	and	lobbyists	for	several different	trade	associations	would	keep	her	occupied	most	of	the	remainder	of the	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	phone	rang,	and	she	picked	it	up	and	answered,	“Valerie	Murphy,”	without taking	her	eyes	off	the	report	she	was	reading. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi,	it’s	David!	Can	I	persuade	you	to	drop	everything	and	come	up	to	New York	this	weekend?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">David. </i>	A	year,	even	six	months	before,	her	heart	would	have	jumped	at	the invitation.	Now	it	seemed	more	like	an	invasion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,	David.	I	may	have	to	work	through	the	weekend.	We’re	pretty busy	right	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	got	something	that	will	change	your	mind,”	he	said,	his	voice	teasing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tickets	to	 <i class="calibre3">Jumping	Through	Fire.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled.  <i class="calibre3">Jumping	Through	Fire</i>	was	the	new	stage	play	by	Steve	Chapman, one	of	her	favorite	playwrights.	And	David	hated	going	to	the	theater. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“David,	that’s	sweet…	I	just	don’t	know	if	I	can	get	away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>A	sigh	on	the	line	told	her	he	was	defeated.	“When	you	start	turning	down	plays, I	start	thinking	you’re	having	doubts	about	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	bit	her	lip.	He	was	right.	She	had	doubts,	plenty	of	them.	On	the	other hand,	she’d	be	a	royal	bitch	to	turn	him	down.	It	had	been	nearly	two	months since	she’d	been	to	New	York.	He	must	have	spent	a	fortune	on	those	tickets—</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	show	had	been	sold	out	six	months	in	advance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right.	I’ll	come	up	on	the	train	Saturday	morning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great.	Call	me	on	the	way,	I’ll	meet	you	at	Penn	Station.	You	know	I	love	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	loud	crash	outside	rattled	the	windows.	She	looked	up	up	in	annoyance,	then back	at	the	desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“David,	let’s	talk	this	weekend.	You	know	me	too	well.	I	 <i class="calibre3">am</i>	having	doubts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	sharp	inhalation	at	the	other	end	of	the	line.	“I	know.	It’s	been	pretty clear	for	a	while.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	you,”	she	said.	“I	just	don’t	know	if	I’m	ready	to	settle	into	something permanent	right	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several	of	the	interns	were	crowded	at	the	window	nearest	her,	strangely	hushed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	faint	line	appeared	over	Valerie’s	forehead.	Why	weren’t	they	working? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	it’s	not	me,	what	is	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	loud	thump	rattled	the	windows,	and	one	of	the	interns	squealed.	Valerie frowned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“David,	I	don’t	know	if	this	is	the	right	time	to	have	this	discussion.	Let’s	talk	in person	this	weekend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well	Christ,	Valerie,	if	this	isn’t	the	time	to	talk	about	it,	why	did	you	bring	it up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know.	You’re	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>Ambrose	appeared	at	the	door	of	the	office	and	waved	at	her	urgently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“David,	I’ve	got	to	go.	Something’s	happening.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	to	go	right	now.	I’ll	see	you	Saturday.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	love	you,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	hung	up	the	phone	without	replying.	A	dozen	steps	took	her	to	Ambrose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	pointed	at	the	television	playing	in	the	reception	area.	The	words	at	the bottom	of	the	screen	told	her	all	she	needed	to	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Explosions	at	the	Pentagon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sorry,	sir.	According	to	this,	you’ve	been	provided	severance	pay	for	nearly four	months.	You’ll	just	have	to	come	back	and	apply	in	October.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	swallowed	his	frustration.	It	was	galling	to	be	in	this	position,	begging help	from	a	government	beauracrat.	But	he	had	a	six	year	old	to	take	care	of,	and didn’t	have	the	luxury	of	pride.	He	leaned	forward,	resting	his	arms	on	the	neat, precise	desk,	behind	which	sat	a	woman	whose	smile	didn’t	illuminate	her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	get	that.	The	issue	is,	the	severance	pay	doesn’t	extend	to	health	insurance.	I have	a	very	sick	son	at	home,	and	it	is	critical	he	stays	covered.	And	I	can’t	get him	covered	until	you	certify	that	I’m	unemployed	and	seeking	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	behind	the	desk	tilted	her	head	as	if	to	say,  <i class="calibre3">so	what? </i>	Murphy	was unnaturally	irritated	by	her	heavy	makeup. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	nothing	I	can	really	do	about	that,	sir.	You’re	not	unemployed	until	the severance	pay	runs	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	closed	his	eyes	and	took	a	deep	breath,	fighting	for	patience.	He	looked up	and	said,	“Without	treatment,	my	son	might	be	dead	by	then.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>“Sir,	I’m	very	sorry,	but	there	is	nothing	I	can	do.	You	might	consider	contacting someone	in	the	state	health	department,	but	we	cannot	list	you	as	unemployed until	October	1,	at	the	end	of	your	severance	period.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Better	to	not	say	anything.	Nothing	at	all. </i>	Murphy	stood,	unintentionally scattering	papers	onto	the	floor,	and	walked	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside,	it	was	grey	and	wet,	rain	coming	down	in	a	flood,	despite	the	fact	that	it was	nearly	June.	Half	a	dozen	cold,	rainy	springs	in	a	row.	So	much	for	global warming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	could	be	a	lot	worse,	he	thought.	He	owned	the	old	house	outright;	though	it had	been	a	real	struggle,	they’d	kept	with	a	fifteen-year	mortgage	and	even	paid it	off	two	years	early.	When	the	deed	came,	delivered	certified	mail,	they	framed it,	then	drove	to	Washington	to	catch	a	play	at	the	Kennedy	Center	and	celebrate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	wasn’t	much	of	a	drinker,	and	neither	was	Martha,	but	that	night	they’d gotten	drunk	on	happiness.	She’d	grown	rounded	at	the	edges	as	they’d	grown older,	but	that	night	she	was	radiant.	It	was	likely	as	not	that	Kenny	Jr.	had	been conceived	in	the	Hotel	Harrington	around	the	corner	from	FBI	headquarters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	addition	to	the	house,	he	still	owned	Martha’s	shop	in	the	center	of	the	town. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	had	been	a	hideous	indulgence	to	close	and	lock	the	doors,	keep	paying	taxes on	it,	fending	off	all	offers	of	a	quick	sale	for	the	prime	retail	spot.	Just	never seemed	right	to	sell	off	all	that	was	left	of	her	life’s	work.	Now	he’d	have	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	alone	ought	to	cover	Kenny’s	insurance	premiums	for	a	few	months,	maybe a	year.	Long	enough	to	find	a	new	job,	anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Too	bad	about	that	bill	from	the	IRS;	he’d	just	written	them	a	check	for	twenty thousand	dollars.	Just	about	cleaned	out	his	savings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	look	like	you’re	doing	a	bit	of	woolgathering	there,	Colonel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Startled	by	the	bass	voice,	Murphy	looked	up,	embarrassed	to	be	found	just standing	outside	the	door	of	the	unemployment	office.	It	was	Joe	and	Mandy Blankenship.	Mandy	had	worked	at	the	plant,	in	Karen	Greenfield’s	department. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	was	a	coalminer,	which	meant	that	he	was	more	often	unemployed	than	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	confess.	You	can	tell	you’re	getting	old	when	you	think	of	ten	years	ago	like	it was	this	morning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>Mandy	smiled,	but	the	smile	wasn’t	genuine.	“Somehow	seeing	you	here	makes it	all	real,	Ken.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	real	enough,”	he	replied.	“How	are	you	two?	Kids	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	Joe’s	an	old	hand	at	this,	what	with	the	coal	mines,”	Mandy	said.	“We’ll	be all	right,	I	suppose,	long	as	we	can	keep	up	on	the	mortgage.	I	didn’t	get	much	in the	way	of	severance	pay,	though.	Hadn’t	been	around	long	enough.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	that’s	too	bad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	the	way,”	Mandy	said,	“Have	you	heard	any	of	that	talk	from	Tim	Wagner about	forming	a	union?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	shook	his	head.	“No.	Tell	you	the	truth,	I	can’t	see	how	a	union	would make	much	difference	at	this	stage.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	I	heard	he’s	trying	to	put	together	a	deal	for	the	workers	to	buy	the plant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	grunted.	That	would	be	a	hell	of	a	coup.	“I’ll	definitely	check	into	it, that	could	make	a	big	difference,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	said	their	goodbyes,	and	Murphy	made	his	way	out	into	the	rain	as	the couple	entered	the	unemployment	office.	In	the	car,	he	turned	on	the	radio	and heard	the	news:	there	had	been	a	bombing	in	Arlington,	Virginia,	outside	the Pentagon.	Without	a	second	thought,	he	dialed	Valerie’s	number	in	Washington. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	Three</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">May	26</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Mike	Morris	pulled	the	car	to	a	stop	in	front	of	the	house,	where	boxes from	the	move	were	stacked	on	the	front	walk.	He	had	turned	off	the	radio	as soon	as	he	got	in	the	car;	he	didn’t	want	to	hear	another	word	about	the Arlington	bombing.	He	suspected	he’d	soon	know	more	about	it	than	he	could ever	hope	to.	Rumor	at	battalion	was	they	were	going	to	be	deployed	as	security near	the	Pentagon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	off	the	car	and	listened	to	the	engine	tick,	watching	the	house.	Worn paint,	dry-rotted	siding.	A	line	of	paving	stones	led	to	the	front	door,	some	of them	uneven,	with	weeds	poking	through	the	cracks.	Inside,	the	carpet	was	a hideous	orange.	It	was	going	to	take	a	lot	of	work	to	make	this	place	feel	like home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enough	stalling.	Alicia	was	going	to	go	bananas	if	they	did	get	deployment orders;	he’d	been	dreading	coming	home	all	afternoon.	There’d	be	a	round	of recriminations,	and	she’d	be	off	to	her	parents	in	Kentucky	or	Washington	or wherever	the	hell	they	were	right	now.	Another	lecture	about	how	Morris	should be	 <i class="calibre3">stable, </i>	more	like	her	own	father.	He	didn’t	need	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	got	out	of	the	car	and	walked	toward	the	house.	The	front	door	opened and	his	six-year-old	daughter	ran	out,	blonde	mane	flying	behind	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Daddy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi,	kid.	How	you	doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Savannah	jumped	up	for	a	hug.	He	carried	her	lightweight	thirty-five	pounds inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Michael,”	Alicia	called	from	the	living	room.	“It’s	your	company	on	the phone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	groaned.	This	had	to	be	it—right	outside	Washington,	DC,	who	else</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>would	deploy	for	something	like	this?	And	why	else	would	they	be	calling	at dinnertime? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Coming.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lowering	Savannah	to	the	floor,	he	said,	“Savannah,	can	you	do	your	daddy	a great	big	favor?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	mean	 <i class="calibre3">yes</i>,”	he	said,	handing	her	his	uniform	cap.	“Can	you	take	this upstairs	for	me	and	put	it	on	the	hatrack?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	sighed.	Some	battles	you	just	couldn’t	win. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	honey.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	ran	upstairs	as	Morris	walked	into	the	living	room.	Alicia	stood,	legs	spread shoulder-width	apart,	one	hand	on	her	hip,	the	other	holding	the	phone	toward him.	She	wore	an	old	pair	of	jeans	and	a	t-shirt	smeared	with	paint	and	dust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’d	spent	the	day	unpacking	and	painting,	and	looked	very	tired.	She	frowned, her	blue	eyes	cold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	took	the	phone	from	his	wife.	She	met	his	eyes,	but	the	look	was	not	warm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	again,	was	it	ever	any	more? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain	Morris	speaking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain,	this	is	Sergeant	Diamond	at	the	company.	We’ve	received	an	alert message	from	battalion.	I	think	this	one’s	for	real,	sir;	Sergeant	Meyer	up	at battalion	said	we’re	going	somewhere.	Something	about	that	bombing	today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roger,	I’ll	be	back	in	fifteen	minutes.	Check	with	Top	about	getting	me	some field	gear	issued;	I	don’t	have	any	equipment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	spoke,	Alicia’s	frown	grew	more	severe,	twin	lines	forming	on	her forehead	between	her	eyes.	Her	back	was	straight,	her	arms	crossed	under	her breasts.	Five	years	ago	he	would	have	found	her	posture	fetching. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	put	the	phone	down	and	sighed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	going	on,	Mike?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	being	alerted.	I	don’t	know	anything	more,	yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	never	stops,	does	it?	I	mean,	you	just	got	home	from	a	year	in	Korea,	and now	we’ve	moved	halfway	to	the	end	of	the	earth.	Will	you	be	home	tonight,	or am	I	going	to	see	you	on	the	news	getting	on	a	plane	to	somewhere?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,	Alicia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	sign	up	to	be	a	single	parent,	you	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Knowing	she	was	right,	Morris	couldn’t	help	biting	back.	“I	guess	you	should have	thought	of	that	before	you	married	an	infantry	officer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	away	so	he	didn’t	have	to	see	her	face	harden,	then	marched	upstairs to	grab	his	always-packed	alert	bag.	Her	shout	caught	him	by	surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	should	have	thought	of	that	before	letting	a	drunk	college	boy	get	me pregnant!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	reached	the	top	step	and	told	himself	to	calm	down,	take	a	deep	breath,	and relax.	She	had	every	right	to	be	upset.	Sometimes	the	alerts	between	the	field deployments—not	to	mention	the	real	deployments—turned	everyone’s	lives upside	down.	For	the	last	several	years	they’d	lived	like	carnies,	traveling	where the	job	took	them,	punctuated	by	Mike’s	long	absences,	including	one	that	lasted over	a	year.	Morris	knew	that	in	her	position,	he’d	be	pissed	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	didn’t	make	dealing	with	her	any	easier.	It	was	like	walking	through	a minefield—he	just	never	knew	what	was	going	to	infuriate	her.	When	he	was	out of	town,	she	took	Savannah	back	home	to	Kentucky,	where	her	father, Congressman	Mark	Skaggs,	constantly	harped	on	how	she’d	screwed	up	her	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	the	thing	Savannah	needed	to	hear	from	her	pig	of	a	grandfather. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	started	collecting	his	things,	and	then	he	heard	Alicia’s	voice	from downstairs.	But	it	was	the	way	her	voice	shook	that	caught	his	attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>“Mike,	you	better	get	down	here	and	see	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	grabbed	his	bag	and	the	cap	Savannah	had	just	brought	upstairs,	and	headed back	down.	Alicia	stood	in	front	of	the	television,	right	arm	clasped	across	her chest,	left	hand	covering	her	mouth.	The	scene	of	devastation	on	the	television was	dramatic:	burning	buildings,	chaos,	smoke	rising	into	the	sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	took	a	moment	for	Morris	to	realize	that	this	scene	wasn’t	from	a	bad	movie.	It was	just	down	the	road	in	Arlington,	Virginia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	better	get	back	to	the	company,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	glanced	over	at	him,	and	in	a	small	voice	said,	“I’m	sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me	too,”	he	whispered.	But	he	left	without	kissing	her	goodbye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">An	hour	later,	the	company	commanders	and	battalion	staff	gathered	in	the briefing	room	in	the	battalion	headquarters,	a	small,	windowless	cube	with	a long	conference	table	stretching	down	the	middle.	All	of	the	officers	but	Morris wore	field	gear,	battle	dress	uniforms	with	pistol	belts,	gas	masks	and	helmets strewn	on	the	conference	table.	Morris,	the	odd	man	out,	had	no	field	gear	as	of yet,	though	his	first	sergeant	had	probably	procured	it	for	him	by	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why	the	hell	did	this	have	to	happen	on	his	first	day	in	charge	of	a	new company?	That	morning	he	had	released	half	his	company	on	pass	so	he	could spend	time	with	the	other	half.	As	a	result,	he	had	several	stragglers	who	hadn’t gotten	word	of	the	alert.	His	new	battalion	commander,	Lieutenant	Colonel Barksdale,	was	pissed.	Not	a	good	way	to	start	his	new	command. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	battalion	intelligence	officer,	Lieutenant	Elaine	Gurewich,	a	strikingly attractive	woman	in	her	early	twenties,	stood	at	the	head	of	the	table	and	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	had	met	the	Army	Intelligence	officer	only	briefly	when	he’d	been assigned	to	the	battalion.	Now	she	commanded	everyone’s	attention	as	she pointed	out	locations	on	a	map	of	Arlington,	Virginia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An	hour	after	the	initial	bombing,	additional	car	bombs	went	off	at	three surrounding	locations.	These	were	devastating;	the	area	was	packed	with	rescue personnel	when	the	bombs	went	off,”	Gurewich	said.	“They	were	timed	to	inflict</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>as	much	damage	as	possible	to	rescue	and	security	personnel.	There	are	likely	to be	additional	devices.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	turned	and	faced	the	group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	clear	the	bombings	were	the	coordinated	actions	of	a	terrorist	group.	No	one has	come	forward	and	claimed	responsibility	at	this	time,	and	the	news	has indicated	no	leads.	I’ve	heard	some	scuttlebutt	from	Brigade	headquarters—I don’t	know	how	reliable—that	they	suspect	Middle	Eastern	origin,	maybe	Al-Qaeda.	There’s	some	evidence	these	were	suicide	bombers.	DHS	is	pursuing	the investigation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	whistled	low	in	the	back	of	the	room.	Morris	sighed.  <i class="calibre3">Suicide	bombers</i> <i class="calibre3">inside	the	United	States. </i>	It	was	bound	to	happen	sometime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Colonel	Barksdale	asked,	“Has	there	been	any	looting?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some.	There’s	a	large	homeless	and	poverty-level	population	in	Arlington,	and one	of	the	shopping	centers	was	heavily	damaged.	However,	our	last	report	has	it that	there	are	hundreds	of	civilians	throughout	the	area,	some	of	them	wounded and	trapped	under	rubble.	It’s	going	to	be	a	bear.	The	Virginia	and	DC	National Guard	are	already	on	station	conducting	rescue	operations,	so	our	mission	will be	security.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barksdale	stood.	“All	right	then.	Everyone	have	your	maps?	I	want	the	battalion to	roll	out	in	thirty	minutes.	Major	Granville,	Lieutenant	Gurewich:	you	go	with the	Scout	Platoon	for	the	quartering	party.	See	if	you	can	set	up	a	liaison	with	the National	Guard,	and	whoever	else	is	down	there.	I	want	all	our	units	on	station no	later	than	midnight.	Understood?	Good.	Dismissed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	officers	filed	out	of	the	room	and	hurried	back	to	their	units. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Private	Jim	Turville	sat	in	the	dark	back	of	a	two-and-a-half-ton	truck,	cramped and	uncomfortable,	with	twenty	other	soldiers	jammed	in	behind	him.	His nostrils	filled	with	the	smell	of	diesel	and	sweat;	closing	his	eyes	didn’t	shut	out the	overwhelming	sounds	and	smells. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	all	right,	get	on	the	truck,	no	more	screwing	around.	We’re	moving</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>out	in	ten	minutes,”	shouted	Sergeant	O’Donnell	as	the	last	of	her	platoon boarded	the	truck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	looked	up	when	he	heard	the	new	company	commander’s	voice	outside the	truck.	“Sergeant	O’Donnell,”	called	Captain	Morris.	“Did	your	wayward private	ever	show	up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes	sir,	about	ten	minutes	ago.	He’s	already	on	the	truck.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	looks	like	we’re	going	to	be	sitting	for	a	few	more	minutes;	why	don’t	you send	him	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roger,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing	the	exchange	outside	the	truck,	Turville	frowned.  <i class="calibre3">Oh,	man. </i>	He	hadn’t thought	they	took	the	travel	limit	stuff	so	seriously	once	you	were	out	of	basic training.	What	a	way	to	make	a	first	impression	on	his	new	commander.  <i class="calibre3">Idiot. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">This	one	mistake	could	screw	his	chances	for	promotion	down	the	line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Private	Turdville,”	called	Corporal	Meigs,	his	fire	team	leader.	“Yo,	get	your butt	off	the	truck.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	shot	Meigs	a	vicious	look	and	stood	up,	his	heavy	combat	gear weighing	him	down.	The	nickname—_Turdville_—had	been	with	him	since elementary	school,	but	it	hadn’t	been	a	big	deal	until	Turville’s	drill	sergeant	at Fort	Benning	thought	of	it,	believing	he	was	the	baddest,	most	original	dude	to walk	the	earth.	Making	Turville’s	life	miserable	had	been	his	major preoccupation	for	three	months.	That	wasn’t	so	bad;	after	all,	being	miserable was	what	basic	training	was	all	about.	But	to	finish	basic	and	end	up	in	this candy-assed	company	with	a	nineteen-year-old	corporal	as	his	first	line supervisor	and	a	woman	for	a	platoon	sergeant—it	was	too	much.	There	couldn’t be	more	than	a	dozen	women	serving	as	platoon	sergeants	in	the	entire	infantry, and	it	was	Turville’s	luck	he’d	gotten	one	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	climbed	over	the	tailgate	of	the	deuce-and-a-half	and	stood	at	parade rest.	“Private	Turville,	reporting	as	ordered,	ma’am.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">O’Donnell,	a	foot	shorter	than	him,	her	brown	hair	bunched	up	under	her	helmet, looked	up	at	him	with	a	frown.	“Do	I	look	like	an	officer	to	you,	Private?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>“No,	Sergeant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	don’t	call	me	ma’am,	you	know	better	than	that.	What	were	you	thinking going	outside	the	mileage	limit,	Private	Turville?	We’ve	got	a	new	company commander,	and	you	went	and	messed	it	up	with	him	on	the	very	first	day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sergeant,	that	was	not	my	intention—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	care	what	your	intention	was,	Private.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	shifted	on	his	feet.	“Yes,	Sergeant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now.	These	are	the	facts.	Our	brand	new	company	commander	gave	everyone two	days	off,	with	the	stipulation	that	you	call	in	twice	a	day	and	that	you	stay within	fifty	miles	of	post,	because	we	are	detailed	for	rapid	deployment	should such	a	deployment	become	necessary.	You,	with	your	boneheaded	reasoning, decided	to	blow	that	off.	You,	a	brand	new	private	in	the	Army,	decided	that your	judgment	was	better	than	that	of	the	senior	officer	of	this	company.	Even more	offensive,	you	decided	your	judgment	was	more	important	than	mine.	Do	I have	it	pretty	much	straight?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	Sergeant,	I—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	what	I	thought.	You	have	been	summoned	to	speak	with	the	commander himself.	You	will	conduct	yourself	in	a	military	manner	when	in	his	presence, though	I	personally	doubt	you	will	ever	make	much	of	a	soldier.	When	he	asks you	what	you	were	thinking,	you	will	respond	by	saying	‘No	excuse,	sir.’	You will	then	accept	whatever	punishment	he	deems	suitable.	You	had	better	hope	he doesn’t	leave	that	punishment	up	to	me.	Do	I	make	myself	absolutely	crystal clear?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	Sergeant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.	Let’s	go	see	the	Captain	then,	and	you	better	pray	that	he	is	merciful	and just.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	Sergeant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>Turville	could	smell	and	hear	it	long	before	they	arrived.	Crammed	in	the	back of	the	truck	at	the	end	of	a	long	drive,	he	couldn’t	see	much,	but	the	sounds	and smells	were	more	than	enough.	A	roar	rose	from	the	still	burning	buildings,	and acrid	black	smoke	filled	the	truck,	burning	his	eyes	and	throat.	He	saw	flashing blue	and	red	lights	in	the	darkness,	heard	sirens	and	the	sound	of	a	single gunshot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	truck	jerked	to	a	stop.	Turville	peered	out	between	the	canvas	panels,	then gasped	and	jerked	his	head	back,	blinking.	On	her	back	in	the	street,	in	a	pool	of light	cast	by	one	of	the	other	trucks,	lay	a	beautiful	redhaired	young	girl	around sixteen,	her	athletic	body	in	a	flowered	and	bloodstained	sundress.	She	had	no legs,	and	the	ground	all	around	her	was	soaked	in	a	pool	of	blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Off	the	truck!	Off	the	truck!”	The	first	sergeant	waved	his	arms	at	them, directing	the	company	to	line	up	near	the	truck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	didn’t	move	until	someone	clapped	him	on	the	shoulder:	Corporal Meigs,	his	lanky,	African	American	fire	team	leader.	“Move	it,	Turdville.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	jerked,	and	then	climbed	out	of	the	bed	of	the	truck,	unable	to	take	his	eyes off	the	dead	girl.	He	was	followed	by	the	rest	of	the	platoon,	someone	muttering, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Holy	shit,	look	at	that,”	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Second	platoon,	over	here,”	shouted	Sergeant	O’Donnell,	a	wisp	of	hair	falling out	from	under	her	helmet.	The	platoon	gathered	around	her,	no	more	than	a hundred	yards	from	the	burning	Crystal	City	Mall,	just	across	the	highway	from the	Pentagon.	“Fall	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	obeyed	the	order,	standing	in	his	rank	to	the	left	of	Meigs.	O’Donnell stood	in	front	of	the	platoon,	face	set	in	grim	lines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen	up,”	she	said.	Turville	had	a	hard	time	looking	away	from	the	body.	“If you	need	to	puke,	go	ahead,	that’s	fine.	No	one	will	think	any	worse	of	you.	But here’s	the	deal:	this	won’t	be	the	only	body	you	are	will	see	in	the	next	few	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Don’t	let	it	interfere	with	your	job.	Understand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	one	responded.	Most	of	the	men	looked	anywhere	but	at	the	body,	or,	for	that matter,	at	Sergeant	O’Donnell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ve	got	about	a	thousand	rescue	workers	out	here	helping	clear	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>wreckage	and	find	people.	Our	job	is	simple:	along	with	the	rest	of	the	battalion, we	provide	perimeter	security	for	the	area.	The	LT	will	brief	us	shortly	on	our positions,	so	just	stay	here	and	stay	calm.	Got	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	one	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rest,”	she	ordered.	The	members	of	the	platoon	sat	down	on	the	sidewalk.	Most of	them	lit	cigarettes.	One	of	the	older	sergeants	took	out	a	deck	of	cards	and started	a	game	of	solitaire	on	the	sidewalk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meigs	muttered	under	his	breath.	Turville	couldn’t	catch	the	words.	Their	squad leader	did,	however.	He	shoved	Meigs’s	shoulder	and	said,	“Shut	up.	She’s	a	hell of	a	good	platoon	sergeant,	a	damn	site	better	than	you,	worm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roger,	Sarge,”	Meigs	replied.	He	ducked	his	head	and	looked	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	looked	up	at	the	sky.	It	was	a	clear	night,	but	the	smoke	and	lights obscured	most	of	his	view	of	the	stars.  <i class="calibre3">All	right,	damn	it. </i>	This	is	what	he’d enlisted	for,	to	help	protect	his	country.	Here	was	his	chance.  <i class="calibre3">Don’t	think	about</i> <i class="calibre3">it.	Just	don’t	think	about	it. </i>	But	his	thoughts	kept	returning	to	the	girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meigs	lay	on	his	back,	his	rucksack	a	makeshift	pillow.	“Don’t	let	it	get	to	you, Turville.	This	is	normal—rush	all	over	the	place	in	a	big	hurry,	then	sit	around waiting.	Good	chance	to	take	a	nap.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can	nap	with…	that?”	Turville	said,	indicating	the	girl’s	body	thirty	feet away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	thing	you	gotta	learn:	take	every	chance	you	get	to	sleep.	You	won’t	get many.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	tried	to	close	his	eyes.	It	was	pointless.	He	lit	a	cigarette	and	looked around,	then	shifted	position,	uncomfortable	sitting	on	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	sat	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	Sarge,”	he	said	to	the	squad	leader.	“Can	we	at	least	cover	the	body	with	a tarp	or	something?	Show	her	some	respect?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	squad	leader,	a	bulky	blonde	man	with	striking	blue	eyes,	replied	in	a	biting</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>tone.	“Good	idea,	Turville.	Why	don’t	you	use	your	shelter	half?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	didn’t	understand	what	their	problem	was;	seemed	like	the	non-commissioned	officers	in	his	squad	had	taken	a	disliking	to	him	without	even giving	him	a	chance.	“You’ll	cover	me	with	the	supply	sergeant?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	Turville,	I	will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	removed	his	shelter	half	from	where	it	was	tied	underneath	his	rucksack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	shelter	half	was	a	large	piece	of	green	canvas.	When	joined	with	a	partner’s shelter	half,	it	would	make	a	functional	tent.	Turville	untied	it,	not	thinking	about what	he	was	about	to	do,	then	walked	toward	the	body,	watching	his	step. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Jesus. </i>	She	was	exquisite:	red	hair	splayed	about,	green	eyes	wide	open,	the	dress gathered	around	her	breasts;	she	looked	like	somebody’s	prom	date.	It	was creepy,	looking	at	someone	so	beautiful	lying	there	dead.	Her	skin	was	ivory pale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	grimaced.  <i class="calibre3">Idiot. </i>	 <i class="calibre3">Of	course	her	skin	is	pale</i>.	Her	blood	was	run	out	all over	the	street,	soaking	the	ground	so	that	it	looked	black.	He	wanted	to	cry, looking	at	her.	Could	have	been	his	sister,	or	one	of	the	girls	he’d	wished	he’d dated	in	high	school.	With	a	snap,	he	spread	the	shelter	half	as	far	as	it	would stretch,	and	then	laid	it	over	the	girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	settled	on	top	of	her,	obscuring	the	contours	of	her	body.	Turville	stared	at	it, then	turned	to	walk	back	to	his	squad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meigs	muttered	something	to	one	of	the	other	NCOs,	then	laughed	out	loud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	felt	his	face	burn	and	didn’t	meet	their	eyes.	He	sat	back	down	and pretended	to	sleep.	Meigs	was	right	about	that:	in	the	Army	you	had	to	learn	to sleep	anywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ten	minutes	later,	Sergeant	O’Donnell	and	the	lieutenant	returned.	O’Donnell looked	at	the	body	and	nodded	in	approval. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fall	in,”	ordered	O’Donnell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	men	and	women	in	the	platoon	jumped	to	their	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lieutenant	didn’t	speak,	his	eyes	going	from	soldier	to	soldier	in	the	platoon. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>He	was	still	new—someone	told	Turville	he’d	just	finished	college	and	this	was his	first	assignment.	Looked	like	it,	the	way	he	was	rocking	on	his	heels,	his hands	clenching	and	unclenching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	here’s	the	deal,”	he	said,	his	voice	high	pitched,	“We’re	to	provide perimeter	security	for	the	search	and	rescue	operations.	What	that	means	is,	we don’t	let	civilians	into	the	area.	Any	we	find,	we	get	them	to	medical	personnel and	law	enforcement	regardless	of	whether	they	think	they	need	help.	The	entire area	between	the	Pentagon	and	the	mall	is	closed	to	civilians.	The	triage	tent	is two	blocks	over	there,	next	to	the	mall.	I’ve	got	tourist	maps	of	the	area	here	for the	squad	leaders;	you	can	use	them	to	orient	yourselves.	Our	positions	are marked.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	pointed	with	his	right	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,	there	has	been	some	looting.	The	word	is	caution.	Each	man	will	be issued	a	loaded	magazine,	but	you	are	not—I	repeat	 <i class="calibre3">not—</i> to	lock	and	load	your weapons	without	approval.	Everyone	understand?	I	will	hold	the	squad	leaders responsible	for	enforcing	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Next:	this	wasn’t	just	a	single	bomb.	About	an	hour	after	the	initial	bomb,	a couple	more	went	off,	killing	a	bunch	of	paramedics	and	firefighters.	It	looks like	this	was	a	well-planned	terrorist	attack.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville’s	stomach	twisted	and	he	looked	away.  <i class="calibre3">Had	to	be	the	Arabs	again. </i> They didn’t	have	any	respect	for	life.	He	still	remembered	the	day	the	Pentagon	and World	Trade	Center	were	hit—he’d	been	in	first	grade	then,	and	everything	was crazy.	Somehow	they’d	got	it	in	their	heads	that	their	parents	were	picking	them up	because	a	plane	was	going	to	hit	the	school,	too.	One	kid	didn’t	come	back for	almost	three	weeks:	his	mother,	an	accountant	who	consulted	for	the Department	of	Defense,	had	been	injured	in	the	Pentagon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	suspect	there	are	more	bombs	scattered	about	the	area,”	the	lieutenant	went on.	“You	will	exercise	extreme	caution	when	approaching	vehicles,	or	anything you	see	lying	in	the	area.	Our	platoon	will	be	a	screening	force	along	Army-Navy	Drive	between	Route	1,	over	here,	and	South	Lynn	St,	over	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lieutenant	gestured	to	the	map	as	he	pointed	out	the	locations.	“I	want	one squad	to	maintain	position	at	the	top	of	the	exit	ramp	from	395	to	the	mall.	The rule	is	simple:	police,	rescue,	fire,	and	military	vehicles	may	pass.	No	one	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>If	someone	tries	to	force	their	way	past,	call	for	help	and	use	the	minimum	force necessary	to	stop	them.	That	includes	the	press—especially	the	press.	They	are not	to	be	allowed	in	this	area.	Sergeant	O’Donnell	or	myself	will	be	the	contacts if	anyone	needs	to	be	taken	into	custody.	Any	questions?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	men	stood	in	silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everyone	on	the	truck.	We’ll	go	the	circuit	and	drop	off	each	squad,”	said Sergeant	O’Donnell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	the	others,	Turville	climbed	back	on	the	truck.	It	moved	toward	Army-Navy	Drive,	depositing	each	group	of	soldiers	at	their	posts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville’s	squad	got	off	the	truck	at	the	corner	of	Army-Navy,	about	two	hundred yards	from	the	still	burning	mall.	Macy’s	was	at	this	end,	the	huge	store windows	smashed	from	the	concussion,	smoke	still	pouring	out	of	the	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	fire	trucks	stood	to	the	side	of	the	building,	near	an	olive-drab	Army	tent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	triage	tent,	the	lieutenant	had	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	front	of	them,	across	the	street,	was	the	sweeping	ramp	from	Interstate	395. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	squad	leader	spoke	to	the	fire	teams.	“Leo,	Gomez,	I	want	you	to	set	up	a position	about	a	hundred	yards	over	there,	right	up	against	the	second	office building.	Sergeant	Nguyen,	you	set	your	team	up	to	block	the	on-ramp	there	and the	approach	from	Army-Navy	over	there.	Meigs,	Turville,	you	guys	walk	the position,	up	to	Fern	Street	and	back.	We’ll	work	out	a	shift	schedule	shortly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meigs	and	Turville	dropped	their	rucksacks	near	the	Sergeant	and	began	walking their	post.	It	was	going	to	be	a	long	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Three	hours	after	the	explosion	near	the	Pentagon,	Murphy	still	hadn’t	reached Valerie,	though	he’d	called	her	office	and	her	cell	phone	repeatedly.	He	was	sure she	was	okay;	she	worked	in	the	Rayburn	House	Office	Building,	miles	away from	the	Pentagon.	All	the	same,	he	was	on	the	verge	of	panic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	drove	back	into	the	Highview	town	square,	scanning	for	a	parking	space.	The spaces	in	the	square	were	all	filled.	Very	unusual;	folks	must	still	be	crowded</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>into	Sally’s	Diner,	watching	the	news	coverage	of	the	bombing.	He	circled	the square. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Daddy,	stop,	I	want	to	get	some	ice-cream,”	Kenny	said,	kicking	the	back	of Murphy’s	seat	and	pointing	out	the	window	at	the	ice	cream	shop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	right	now;	we’re	in	a	hurry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Daddy	hates	me,”	Kenny	said	the	words	in	a	sing-song,	whining	voice	like fingernails	scraping	across	a	blackboard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	glanced	back	at	his	son	in	the	rearview-mirror.	It	was	so	frustrating: they	would	have	one	or	two	good	weeks,	and	then	Kenny	would	slide	back,	with mood	swings	and	tantrums,	behaving	like	a	two	or	three	year-old	rather	than	a six	year-old.	Murphy	reminded	himself	that	the	boy	had	no	idea	that	something terrible	had	happened.	And	he	wasn’t	responsible	for	his	steadily	worsening neurological	condition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	the	hell	was	Murphy	going	to	do	without	health	insurance?	And	why couldn’t	he	reach	Valerie?	He	spoke,	an	edge	in	his	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	time	for	that	now.	I	need	to	get	you	to	Samira’s	so	I	can	get	to	my	meeting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	right?	No	more	complaining.	We’ll	do	something	fun	tomorrow;	it	looks	like I	won’t	be	going	to	the	office	anytime	soon,	so	I’ll	pick	you	up	straight	from school.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	town	square	included	a	well-manicured	green	area	in	the	center,	surrounded by	shops.	He	parked	the	car	in	front	of	the	Al-Khoury	Lebanese	Grocery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	kiddo,”	he	said,	stepping	out	of	the	car.	He	walked	around	to	the	other side	and	opened	the	rear	passenger	door.	Kenny	climbed	out.	Murphy	was	lucky this	time:	it	hadn’t	turned	into	a	full-fledged	tantrum.	He	didn’t	have	time	for that	right	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	took	a	deep	breath	when	they	walked	in.	He	loved	the	fragrance	of	the spices.	Ahmed,	the	owner,	waved	to	him	from	the	counter	as	he	came	in	the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ken,	Ken,	I	heard	about	the	plant.	Is	everything	okay?	Can	I	get	you	anything?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>“No	thanks,	Ahmed.	I’m	all	right,	just	dropping	Kenny	off	with	Samira.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	on	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	and	his	son	headed	down	the	narrow,	crowded	aisle	to	the	stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ahmed’s	family	lived	in	the	small	apartment	upstairs.	Samira,	Ahmed’s	twenty-year	old	daughter,	was	a	student	at	Jefferson	County	Community	College	and had	been	baby-sitting	Kenny	off	and	on	for	the	last	three	years.	He	paused	and tilted	his	head,	listening	as	he	heard	Ahmed’s	radio.	More	bad	news	from Washington. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	jerked	as	the	door	burst	in	with	a	crash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everybody	freeze!	Don’t	move!	Don’t	move!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	shouts,	Kenny	screamed.	Murphy	pulled	the	boy	close	to	him	and	backed against	the	wall,	all	thoughts	gone	but	escape	for	his	son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	said	don’t	move!”	shouted	a	man,	dressed	in	all	black,	wearing	a	flak	vest	and helmet.	He	pointed	a	folding	stock	rifle	straight	at	Murphy’s	head.	Murphy looked	back	at	the	rifle,	the	barrel	gaping.	Near	panic	struck,	his	heart	thumping wildly	as	he	held	his	son	close.	The	boy	shook;	Murphy	gathered	him	close.	His eyes	narrowed	when	he	noticed	the	letters	embroidered	above	the	man’s	pocket: DHS.	Department	of	Homeland	Security. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several	other	men,	all	dressed	the	same	as	the	first,	had	shoved	Ahmed	against the	wall.	Two	more	men	pounded	up	the	stairs.	Murphy	listened	to	their pounding	footsteps,	then	screams	upstairs	as	they	entered	the	upper	floor.  <i class="calibre3">What</i> <i class="calibre3">was	this? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">He	took	a	breath,	then	spoke,	enunciating	each	word	to	keep	his	voice	from quivering.	“Mister,	I	don’t	know	who	you	are,	but	you	are	scaring	my	son.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shut	up!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	men	at	the	counter,	short	and	balding	with	pale	blue	eyes	framed	by thick	glasses,	looked	up	at	the	shout,	frowning,	and	said,	“Bobby,	chill	out.	Just keep	an	eye	on	the	guy;	he’s	not	what	we’re	here	for.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	guarding	Murphy	glanced	back	over	his	shoulder,	then	back	at	Murphy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>He	didn’t	say	anything	further. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	of	the	men	bent	Ahmed	over	the	counter	and	cuffed	his	hands	behind	his back.	Two	more	came	down	the	stairs,	leading	the	entire	family,	including Ahmed’s	wife	Maryam	and	their	three	children.	The	middle	child,	Hayder,	was seventeen,	a	senior	at	Jefferson	County	High	School.	The	agents	pushed	him	to the	counter	next	to	his	father;	then	pushed	the	women	and	girls	to	the	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,”	said	the	balding	man	at	the	counter.	“You	gentlemen	cooperate	and we’ll	have	you	home	right	quick.	We	just	want	to	ask	you	some	questions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse	me,	sir,”	Murphy	said.	“Are	you	in	charge	of	these	people?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	looked	up	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	need	to	mind	your	own	business,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	felt	his	eyebrows	begin	to	twitch.	“Now	look.	You	men	came	in	here brandishing	guns	at	my	six-year-old	son	without	identifying	yourselves.	I	say this	is	my	business.	I	want	to	talk	to	you,	right	this	minute.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kenny	grabbed	Murphy’s	waist	tighter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	walked	across	the	aisle	toward	Murphy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	I	suggest	again	that	you	mind	your	own	business.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	your	name?	Who	are	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	pulled	a	small	folder	out	and	held	it	up	in	Murphy’s	face.	“I’m	Agent Justin	Hagarty	with	the	Department	of	Homeland	Security.	I’m	with	the	Harpers Ferry	extension	office.	We’re	here	to	investigate	a	terrorist	attack	that	took	place today,	and	you,	sir,	are	dangerously	close	to	obstruction	of	justice.	These	men may	have	knowledge	of	the	attack.	They’ll	be	detained	briefly,	questioned,	and released—assuming	everything	is	in	order.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	have	a	warrant?	Where	are	you	taking	them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	need	a	warrant	to	detain	and	question	men	suspected	of	involvement with	terrorism.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>Murphy	took	a	breath	and	replied,	“According	to	the	United	States	Constitution you	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty	shook	his	head	and	spoke	in	a	calm,	cool	tone.	“Mister,	you	can	debate that	in	the	courts.	My	job	is	to	protect	people,	not	argue.	We	all	have	to	give	up some	freedoms	in	order	to	be	safe,	so	let	me	be	clear:	if	you	give	us	any	more trouble,	we	will	hold	you	on	charges	of	obstruction	of	justice,	and	maybe	as	a material	witness	while	we	look	into	your	connection	with	these	suspected terrorists.	You	don’t	want	that	to	happen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	recoiled.	“Are	you	threatening	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	think	is	going	to	happen	with	that	boy	if	you’re	in	jail?	A	widower like	you?	I	think	they	call	it	child	abandonment	when	a	single	parent	goes	to jail.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	felt	his	face	heat,	and	he	clenched	his	fists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty	looked	down	at	the	shaking	boy,	then	met	Murphy’s	eyes.	“You	know,	a boy	in	his	condition—he	wouldn’t	do	well	in	foster	care.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	go,”	he	called	to	the	other	men,	and	they	led	Ahmed	and	Hayder	toward the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Hagarty	reached	the	door,	Murphy	called	out,	“Hagarty!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	agent	turned	around	and	looked	back,	Murphy	went	on.	“How	do	you know	my	son’s	condition?	And	that	I’m	a	widower?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty	looked	back	and	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	my	job,	Colonel	Murphy.	To	keep	an	eye	on	things.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	left,	and	the	bell	chimed	as	the	door	closed	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	Four</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">May	27</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kenny,	it’s	time	to	go,”	Murphy	called.	He’d	had	his	coffee	and	his	shower,	but the	horror	of	a	nightmare	the	night	before	still	clung	to	him,	though	he	could	no longer	recall	the	specifics.	Dreams	featuring	Martha—sometimes	real	freak-show	dreams—were	sometimes	a	staple	in	his	life.	The	last	couple	years,	they’d come	even	more	frequently	than	the	sometimes	bizarre	dreams	he	still occasionally	had	about	Iraq. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kenny	didn’t	answer	his	call.	Murphy	stood,	balancing	on	a	cane,	and	walked	to Kenny’s	room.	The	boy	had	crawled	under	the	sturdy	oak	bed	Murphy	had	built for	Valerie	twenty-five	years	ago.	He	leaned	over	just	far	enough	to	see	Kenny’s face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,	kiddo.	It’s	time	to	get	going	to	school.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kenny	shook	his	head.	“Why	do	I	have	to	go?	I	want	to	stay	home!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	squeal	in	Kenny’s	voice	was	like	fingernails	scraping	across	a	chalkboard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	been	through	this	a	hundred	times,	Kenny.	Come	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	I’m	not	coming	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Kenny</i>.	We’ve	both	got	things	to	do,	and	I	have	to	get	you	to	school.	I’m counting	to	three.	One.	Two.	Three.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!	Not	coming	out!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Damn	it. </i>	Murphy	reached	under	the	bed	and	grabbed	the	boy’s	arm.	He	pulled, hard,	and	Kenny	slid	out	from	under	the	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ow!”	he	shouted,	“You	hurt	me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kenny,	come	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>“Mean	Daddy.	I’m	not	doing	anything	with	you!”	Kenny	tried	to	twist	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	tightened	his	grip	on	his	wrist	and	dragged	him	into	the	living	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kenny	is	this	for	you,	or	is	it	for	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	just	want	to	hurt	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	stopped.  <i class="calibre3">Breathe.	Calm	down. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kenny,	I	do	not	want	to	hurt	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kenny	screwed	up	his	face.	“Daddy’s	fault!”	he	shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	looked	his	son	in	the	eye,	bending	so	there	were	about	three	inches between	them.	“You’re	right.	It’s	my	fault.	I	want	to	hurt	you.	I	practice	every night,	thinking	up	new	ways	to	torture	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kenny	backpedaled.	“No	you	don’t.	That’s	silly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	finally	settled	down	for	breakfast	while	Murphy	began	making	his	lunch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kenny	had	been	diagnosed	with	cerebral	adrenoleukodystrophy,	ALD,	about eighteen	months	after	Martha	died.	The	disease	caused	fatty-acid	chains	to	build up	in	his	nervous	system,	triggering	an	immune	response	that	was	slowly destroying	his	nerve	tissue.	It	had	been	getting	progressively	worse,	and	the	only treatment—administering	oil	composed	of	saturated	fats—only	helped	if	it	was introduced	before	the	onset	of	symptoms.	It	was	too	late	for	Kenny.	As	the	long chains	of	fatty	acids	built	up	in	his	nervous	system	and	adrenal	glands,	he	slowly deteriorated,	had	more	and	more	seizures,	and	one	day	they	would	kill	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	daily	exercise	regimen,	combined	with	vitamins	and	drugs	to	control	seizures, acted	together	to	hold	back	the	deterioration	and	hopefully	prolong	his	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	one	day	there	would	even	be	a	real	treatment,	or	a	cure.	A	good	number of	studies	were	underway,	but	Murphy	knew	of	none	that	were	making	any	real progress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	work	for	Murphy	today,	but	he	got	dressed	and	prepared	regardless.	His closet	was	still	organized	the	way	Martha	had	set	it	up	years	before,	his	casual and	work	clothes	within	easy	reach,	the	dress	uniforms	and	suits	high	to	the	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	spare	leg,	socks	and	gel	padding	occupied	a	box	below	the	suits.	Her	side	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>the	closet	stood	empty,	even	after	three	years;	he	had	given	the	clothes	to	the Amvets	Thrift	Shop	in	Harpers	Ferry,	but	he	couldn’t	bring	himself	to	hang anything	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	carefully	changed	the	sock	and	padding	on	the	stump	of	his	left	leg, then	dressed	in	a	coal	grey	suit,	a	gift	from	Martha	on	their	twentieth anniversary.	After	he	dropped	Kenny	off	at	school	he	would	drive	to	Charleston</p>
<p class="calibre1">—a	three-hour	trip	since	they	built	the	new	340	Extension—to	see	Major General	Harris	Peak.	Samira	would	pick	Kenny	up	from	school.	They	still	had heard	nothing	about	the	whereabouts	of	Ahmed	and	Hayder,	though	Valerie	had promised	him	the	night	before	that	Congressman	Clark	would	look	into	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	had	been	well	into	the	evening	before	he’d	finally	reached	her.	He	was	well aware	that	only	on	the	rarest	occasions	did	she	have	business	across	the	river	at the	Pentagon.	All	the	same,	for	hours	he’d	dialed	her	office	and	cell	phone numbers	trying	to	get	through,	in	a	half-panicked	daze.	He’d	never	really	gotten over	the	loss	of	his	wife,	and	he	knew	it.	To	lose	one	of	his	children—that	would be	unbearable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	any	luck,	General	Peak	would	be	able	to	get	the	battalion	activated	to	help deal	with	the	emergency	in	Arlington,	Virginia.	If	nothing	else,	activation	would help	some	of	the	guys	with	immediate	income	needs	while	they	tried	to	figure out	what	to	do.  <i class="calibre3">And	ladies, </i>	he	thought.	Even	after	five	years,	he	couldn’t	get	his mind	around	the	idea	of	having	women	in	tank	companies.	Of	course,	he	still only	had	to	deal	with	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’d	be	easier	if	Karen	Greenfield	were	ugly.	Then	at	least	half	his	officers wouldn’t	be	chasing	after	her.	But	she	wasn’t,	and	rumor	had	it	every	captain	and lieutenant	in	the	battalion	had	hit	on	her	at	least	once	since	she’d	joined	the	unit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	the	same	at	the	Saturn	Plant.	Had	been	the	same,	anyway.	So	far	as	he knew,	she’d	never	dated	anyone	local.	He	knew	the	scuttlebutt—the	managers	at Saturn	said	she	was	a	lesbian.	Sounded	like	a	case	of	sour	grapes	to	Murphy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dressed,	he	went	back	downstairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kenny	was	sitting	at	the	oak	kitchen	table.	An	angry	red	handprint	on	his	wrist marked	the	spot	where	Murphy	had	yanked	on	his	arm	to	pull	him	out	from under	the	bed.	Murphy	swallowed,	hard.	He	had	never	done	anything	like	that when	Valerie	was	a	kid.	He’d	never	done	that	before	Martha	died.	A	wave	of shame	and	sadness	washed	over	him,	and	for	just	a	moment,	he	wished	he	could</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>just	sit	down	and	quit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	sighed	and	looked	at	his	son	again,	eating	his	breakfast	and	reading	a	book about	Mars	exploration.	Time	for	Kenny	to	go	to	school,	and	for	Murphy	to	go, hat	in	hand,	begging.	There	would	be	time	to	sit	when	Kenny	was	taken	care	of. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">At	an	outside	table	overlooking	the	sluggish	Kanawha	River,	swollen	with	mud from	last	week’s	rain,	Major	General	Harris	Peak,	Commander	of	West Virginia’s	National	Guard,	sat	across	from	Murphy.	The	sky	was	clear	and	blue, wispy	clouds	high	above,	and	a	light	breeze	carried	the	smell	of	blooming flowers	to	them	from	the	landscaped	garden	next	to	the	river.	They	were	eating at	one	of	the	several	outdoor	restaurants	overlooking	the	plaza	in	downtown Charleston. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,	Ken,	I	understand	what	you’re	saying.	I	just	don’t	think	there’s	much	we can	do.	The	Army’s	already	decided	what	units	to	activate.	They	don’t	need	tank battalions	for	this.	It’s	all	rescue	and	security	work.	The	only	Army	force deployed	right	now	is	an	infantry	battalion	out	of	Fort	Meade,	and	the	DC</p>
<p class="calibre1">National	Guard.”	A	slight	breeze	from	the	river	ruffled	Peak’s	steel-grey	hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	leaned	forward	as	he	spoke,	his	hands	flat	on	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“General,	this	could	make	all	the	difference	in	the	world	to	the	people	in Highview—the	folks	in	my	battalion.	Almost	every	last	one	of	them	lost	their jobs,	sir.	They’ve	got	no	means	of	support.	You	understand	what	this	will	do	to our	retention,	our	combat	readiness?	I	won’t	have	fifty	percent	of	those	folks	in eight	weeks;	everyone	will	be	leaving	town	to	find	jobs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know,	Ken,	but	the	Guard	isn’t	a	jobs	program.	Besides,	where	do	you	think they’re	going	to	go?	Where	the	hell	are	they	going	to	find	jobs?	It’s	no	better	in Charleston.	It’s	no	better	anywhere,	from	what	I	can	see.	The	whole	damn economy	is	tanking.	Look,	I	promise	you	if	anything	comes	up	anywhere	in	the world	that	looks	like	it	will	require	activating	Guard	units,	I’ll	get	your	name	up there.	But	more	than	that	I	can’t	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	as	much	as	he	could	expect,	he	supposed.	Not	enough.	He	took	a	sip	of	his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>coffee	and	sat	back,	eyes	scanning	the	river. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	enough	of	this,”	said	the	General,	his	eyes	glancing	at	the	wedding ring	on	Murphy’s	left	hand.	“How	is	your	family?	Isn’t	your	daughter	working up	on	the	Hill	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	is,	sir.	She’s	working	for	Al	Clark	now.	It	took	a	while,	but	I	finally	got	a hold	of	her	last	night.	All	the	phone	lines	into	DC	were	tied	up	all	day	yesterday. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’re	going	pretty	crazy	with	the	bombing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	imagine.	Al	Clark—he’s	a	democrat?	Well,	I	can’t	hold	that	against	her;	that	is great,	just	great.	Look,	we’ll	talk	again	in	a	couple	weeks,	all	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,”	Murphy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peak	wiped	his	face	with	his	napkin	and	placed	it	on	his	plate,	then	stood.	“Well, I’ve	got	a	one	o’clock	meeting.	Keep	me	informed,	Murphy.	I	want	to	know right	away	if	people	from	your	unit	do	start	to	leave	town.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peak	marched	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	frowned.	He’d	known	General	Peak	twenty	years,	and	had	hoped	he would	be	more	helpful.	Not	this	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	settled	with	the	waitress,	then	went	back	to	his	car.	What	was	he	going to	do?	It	had	been	twenty	years	since	he’d	conducted	a	job	search. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	drive	back	to	Highview	was	slow,	and	Murphy	found	himself	thinking	in circles,	frustrated,	and	especially	afraid	for	his	son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	hours	into	the	drive,	the	phone	rang,	interrupting	his	thoughts</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Murphy,	this	is	Sarah	Hughes	at	Highview	Country	Day	School.”	Sarah was	the	administrator	at	his	son’s	school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi,	ma’am.	What	can	I	do	for	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Murphy,	Kenny	seems	to	be	having	trouble—I	think	you	need	to	get	here	as soon	as	you	can.”	Her	voice	shook. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>“What’s	the	problem,	Ms.	Hughes?”	Murphy	asked,	unable	to	suppress	the	alarm in	his	tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	he	was	holding	his	arm	and	wrist	and	screaming.	It	was—terrifying.	I think	they	were	muscle	spasms.	He’s	in	the	nurse’s	office	right	now,	lying	down, but	he	seems	to	be	in	a	lot	of	pain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	interrupted.	“Ms.	Hughes,	I	am	on	my	way,	but	it	will	take	me	an	hour to	get	back,	and	that’s	if	I	speed	all	the	way.	I	need	you	to	call	an	ambulance	and get	him	to	the	hospital	right	now.	Right	this	instant.	The	nurse	has	her instructions	already;	she’s	to	give	him	his	autoinjector	right	away,	ma’am,	you understand?	Right	now.	Then	call	911	and	get	him	to	the	hospital.	I’ll	meet	him there.	This	could	be	very	serious,	even	life	threatening.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	disconnected	the	phone	and	accelerated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">An	hour	later,	Murphy	slammed	the	door	of	his	car	and	raced	for	the	emergency room,	long	familiar	with	the	way	there.	The	first	time	had	been	for	Martha. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse	me,	Miss.	My	name	is	Ken	Murphy.	My	son	was	brought	here	from school.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	at	the	desk	looked	up	at	him.	Her	eyes	were	bloodshot,	with	dark circles	under	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hold	on	just	a	moment,	Mr.	Murphy;	one	of	the	nurses	will	be	right	with	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five	minutes	later	he	stood	next	to	his	son.	Kenny	was	wearing	an	oxygen	mask, but	at	least	there	was	no	respirator	this	time.	His	eyes	were	closed.	Attached wires	and	electrodes	led	to	computers	that	monitored	his	heart	rate,	blood pressure,	and	breathing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	sat	down	in	the	chair	next	to	the	bed	and	touched	his	son’s	hand.	He	was grateful	they	hadn’t	had	to	use	the	respirator	this	time.	Last	time,	Kenny	had awakened	with	the	tubes	down	his	throat	and	panicked	until	Murphy	could	calm him	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	given	him	an	anesthetic	to	help	him	sleep,”	said	the	doctor,	a	young	man</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>with	already	thinning	black	hair.	“In	the	short	term,	there’s	not	much	we	can	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Understand,”	Murphy	said.	“At	least	he’s	comfortable	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	doctor	looked	a	bit	hopeless.	Murphy	was	familiar	with	the	routine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Colonel	Murphy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	looked	up.	One	of	the	nurses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	you	come	to	the	desk	for	a	moment,	sir.	We’ve	got	a	small	problem.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure.”	He	followed	her	out	to	the	desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	I	don’t	know	how	to	approach	you	with	this—we	got	a	call	from	the	front office.	They	indicated	your	insurance	coverage	has	been	cancelled	as	of yesterday	and	that	they	will	refuse	to	pay	any	claims.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	felt	a	sharp	pain	in	his	stomach.	“That	can’t	be	right.	I’ve	been	laid	off, but	my	insurance	is	still	good,	at	least	through	the	end	of	the	month.	I’ll	call them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	worry	about	your	son,	sir.	We’ll	treat	him,	of	course,	no	matter	what.	But the	front	office	is	going	to	insist	you	pay,	if	the	insurance	won’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	I	use	your	phone?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thirty	minutes	later,	Murphy	was	red-faced	and	frustrated.	The	number	on	his insurance	card	led	to	a	computer	system	that	seemed	to	go	around	in	circles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">None	of	the	choices	led	to	a	human	being,	but	he	received	the	same	answer	from the	computer,	over	and	over	again:	his	coverage	had	been	cancelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	nurses	approached.	“Mr.	Murphy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	son	is	awake	sir,	if	you	want	to	come	see	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	hung	up	and	hurried	to	the	room.	He’d	deal	with	the	insurance	later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kenny	lay	in	the	bed,	his	face	pale. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>“Daddy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	smiled	as	he	looked	at	his	father	and	his	eyes	crossed,	the	left	eye	turning inward.	Murphy	swallowed	his	anxiety.	The	crossed	eyes	were	new,	and	a	very bad	sign.	The	disease	was	progressing.	He	sat	next	to	his	son	and	smiled,	trying to	hide	his	distress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	little	man.	You	doing	ok?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	I’m	feeling	better	now.	When	I	was	at	school	my	arm	hurt	really	bad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	the	same	arm	Murphy	had	grabbed	that	morning.	“I	know.	Does	it	still hurt	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	a	little.	Am	I	going	to	have	to	stay	in	the	hospital	long	this	time?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	we	leave	here,	can	we	go	to	the	toy	store?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	smiled.	“Sure.	Maybe	we	can	pick	out	a	new	train	for	your	set.	Would you	like	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	Daddy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	sat	for	a	few	minutes,	and	then	Kenny	said,	“Daddy,	will	you	read	me	a book?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	wiped	his	eyes,	then	answered	his	son.	“Sure,	little	guy.	Whatever	you want.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	Five</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">May	27</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	Murphy	arrived	at	work	early	the	day	after	the	attack	and	found	the office	in	chaos.	The	phones	were	ringing	off	the	hook,	and	already	there	were four	people	waiting	in	the	reception	area,	without	appointments,	hoping	to	see the	Congressman.	She	quickly	sorted	out	the	office,	allocating	emergency	jobs	to the	staff	to	quickly	deal	with	the	onslaught	of	constituent	calls,	then	prepared	for a	brief	meeting	with	Ambrose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	Clark	was	in	meetings	this	morning,	so	they	used	his	office,	away	from	the rest	of	the	staff.	The	walls	of	his	office	were	covered	in	plaques,	mementos	from campaigns,	photographs	from	the	district.	Opposite	his	desk,	at	the	other	end	of the	long	office,	a	leather	couch	faced	matching	chairs	over	a	glass	coffee	table overflowing	with	files	and	documents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First	on	the	agenda	was	the	bombings.	The	Department	of	Homeland	Security had	come	down	unusually	strong	across	the	country:	according	to	some	reports, they	were	picking	up	immigrants	off	the	street	and	arresting	them	with	virtually no	due	process.	Given	that	one	of	the	main	targets	was	a	DHS	office,	she	wasn’t terribly	surprised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	there,	they	moved	on	to	the	Skaggs	bill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	we	need	to	do	is	make	sure	the	hearings	are	a	complete	circus,”	Valerie said.	“Get	hardworking	Americans	who	will	be	devastated	by	this	bill	as witnesses.	Get	half	a	dozen	to	sit	in	front	of	the	committee	and	speak,	maybe appear	in	media	interviews.	We	need	a	public	groundswell	against	the	bill	if there’s	to	be	any	chance	at	all	to	kill	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	Senator	Parkinson	endorsed	the	bill	this	morning?”	Ambrose	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	twirled	the	tip	of	his	mustache	between	his	fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	didn’t.	That	means	most	of	the	democrats	will	follow	suit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	will	if	they	want	to	preserve	their	political	careers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a>“It	just	means	we’ll	have	to	work	harder,	that’s	all.	We	can	win	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ambrose	grinned.	“You	know	something,	Valerie,	that’s	what	I	like	about	you.	It doesn’t	matter	who	we	have	against	us,	you	are	always	confident.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	usually	win,	don’t	I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘True,”	he	conceded.	“But	when	I	look	at	the	support	this	thing	is	generating,	I feel	the	same	thing	I	felt	living	in	Morgantown	when	I	realized	I	was	gay—like there	was	a	very	bad	dude	just	around	the	corner	ready	to	kick	my	ass	into	the next	county.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	took	a	sip	of	tea,	then	set	the	cup	back	down	on	the	table,	away	from	the	pile of	papers.	“I	know	what	you	mean.	It	did	work	out	for	you	in	the	end,	though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	it	did,	honey,	after	I	fled	West	Virginia.”	After	he	said	the	words,	a tremendous	smile	appeared	on	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	for	God’s	sake,	we’ve	got	to	make	people	see	it.	The	people	in	our	district will	be	killed	by	this,	with	all	the	job	losses	in	the	last	couple	years.	Even	the high	technology	folks	aren’t	immune;	Christ,	my	father	got	laid	off	along	with everyone	at	his	plant.	He	worked	for	his	company	for	twenty	years.	His	wife	is dead,	and	he’s	raising	a	son	with	a	terminal	illness	that	costs	hundreds	of thousands	of	dollars	a	year	to	treat,	and	what	will	he	do	if	this	bill	goes	through? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Don’t	they	understand	what	this	will	do	to	people?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ambrose	leaned	forward.	“You’re	right.	Valerie,	you	need	to	tell	that	story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Better	yet,	your	father	needs	to.	Isn’t	he	a	general	or	something	in	the	National Guard,	too?	And	a	war	hero?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	not	one	to	talk	about	anything	in	public,”	she	said,	her	voice	subdued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,	don’t	hit	me,	Valerie,	but	he	could	be	the	story.	Christ	almighty,	we couldn’t	pick	a	better	poster	child	if	we	made	him	up.	You	get	your	father	on	the cover	of	Time,	and	maybe	you	can	win	this	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	felt	her	cheeks	grow	hot.	Ambrose	seemed	to	sense	the	approaching explosion	and	leaned	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	don’t	get	mad	at	me;	you	have	to	see	it.”	He	ticked	off	fingers	on	his	right</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>hand.	“Look,	everyone	likes	and	respects	your	father,	I’ve	seen	it.	One,	he’s	a hardworking	American.	Two,	he’s	a	veteran	of	a	war.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Two,	actually.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Even	better.	Third,	he’s	a	widower,	and	his	wife	was	killed	by	the	very	type	of random	crime	people	are	so	afraid	of.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sat	up	straight,	now	truly	outraged.	“Damn	it,	Ambrose.	That’s	going	too	far. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s	no	way	I	will	ask	him	to	talk	about	that	in	public.	It’ll	kill	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	want	to	win	this,	Valerie?	Stop	trying	to	take	care	of	your	father	for	a change	and	look	around.	He	might	just	be	able	to	do	it.	Number	four,	after	all that,	he	paid	his	daughter’s	way	through	college.	Number	five,	his	beloved	son	is very	ill	and	now	that	he	is	out	of	work	the	only	help	he’ll	get	will	be	from	the government.	The	only	thing	that	could	make	it	better	is	if	he	were	a	disabled vet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	cynical	bastard,”	she	said,	laughing	in	half	admiration.	“You	didn’t	know, did	you?	He	hides	it	so	goddamn	well.	He	lost	his	left	leg	below	the	knee	in Iraq.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	rest	my	case,”	Ambrose	said.	He	leaned	back,	a	smile	on	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sighed	and	closed	her	eyes,	annoyed	that	Ambrose	looked	so	pleased	with himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	I’ll	talk	to	him.	But	I’m	telling	you	now,	he	won’t	have	anything	to	do with	this	trash.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	you	can	do	is	ask.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">That	Sunday,	Valerie	slipped	away	from	the	office	and	drove	north	on	Interstate 270,	then	west	on	US	340	until	she	passed	Harpers	Ferry	and	reached	home	in Highview. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	newscasters	on	the	radio	went	on	incessantly.	The	Department	of	Homeland Security	had	announced	they	had	a	suspect	in	the	Arlington	bombing,	a	radical</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>militia	group	called	the	Shenandoah	Sons	of	Liberty,	operating	out	of	the	West Virginia	mountains.	Agents	were	at	a	standoff	with	the	terrorists	at	a	remote compound	near	Baughman	Settlement.	At	least	they	weren’t	rounding	up	Arabs all	over	the	country	anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	changed	radio	stations	without	any	luck:	all	the	news	stations	were	talking about	the	same	thing.	She	had	heard	a	little	about	them	before;	Baughman Settlement	wasn’t	close	to	her	home,	situated	in	the	mountains	near	Front	Royal, but	because	of	the	most	recent	redistricting,	Baughman	had	ended	up	in	Clark’s district.	It	was	a	strange	group.	Situated	just	a	few	miles	out	of	town	in	the backwoods,	they	weren’t	connected	to	the	outside	world:	no	running	water, electricity	or	telephone	lines.	It	seemed	odd	to	her	that	they	were	involved	in terrorism—they	seemed	almost	fanatically	apolitical,	and	terrorism	was	by nature	a	political	act. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Experts	were	being	interviewed,	as	well	as	obscure	professors	and	former military	analysts,	most	of	whom	probably	knew	nothing.	The	current	speaker	on the	radio	was	hysterically	calling	for	a	national	database	to	track	everyone,	so people	could	be	profiled	based	on	their	movements,	their	purchases,	their religious	affiliations.	Valerie	grimaced.	Didn’t	they	know	the	Defense Department	had	had	that	set	up	for	ten	years	now? </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	switched	off	the	radio. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	reached	home	after	an	uneventful	drive,	and	was	immediately	thrown	off balance.	Normally,	when	she	arrived,	Kenny	barreled	out	into	the	driveway	to hug	her,	soon	followed	by	her	father.	Not	this	time:	when	she	arrived,	Murphy came	to	the	door	without	his	young	son	and	waved.	She	felt	a	sigh	of	relief	when she	walked	in	the	door,	embraced	her	father,	and	saw	Kenny	listlessly	reading	a book	on	the	couch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	that	Kenny	was	home	from	the	hospital,	she	spent	the	morning	playing games	with	him	while	her	father	cooked.	She	tried	to	hide	her	distress.	Kenny’s left	eye	didn’t	track	with	the	right,	and	seemed	to	wander	aimlessly,	and	his hands	shook	like	an	old	man’s.	He	hadn’t	been	so	bad	when	she’d	last	seen	him, only	two	months	before.	It	was	hard	to	believe	how	much	he	had	detiorated	in the	two	months	since	she’d	been	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every	once	in	a	while	she	looked	up	at	her	father,	in	the	kitchen,	and	wondered</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p63"></a>how	he	would	survive	losing	his	son	so	soon	after	Mom	died.	Since	her	mother had	died,	he	seemed	more	and	more	like	an	old	oak	tree,	strong	on	the	outside, but	hollow,	ready	to	break.	He’d	lost	a	lot	of	weight,	though	he’d	been	fit	and muscular	all	his	life.	Now	his	clothes	hung	too	loose.	Then	there	were	the	spells</p>
<p class="calibre1">—they’d	talk,	and	something	would	make	him	think	of	Mom,	and	he	would	stop talking	and	just	stare	out	into	space,	remembering,	not	aware	that	his	face	had gone	slack,	and	at	moments	like	that	she	thought	he	was	nearer	to	death	than	life, or	wished	he	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	knew	it	was	morbid,	but	visiting	her	childhood	home	sometimes	felt	like visiting	a	mausoleum.	Her	father	was	so	burdened,	with	sadness,	with	worry about	Kenny.	Sometimes	after	a	visit,	she	would	cry	all	the	way	home,	though she	didn’t	know	whether	it	was	her	mother	she	cried	for	or	her	heartbroken father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	lunch,	Kenny	went	around	the	side	of	the	house	to	play	in	his	sandbox. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	brought	out	a	pitcher	of	iced	tea	and	poured	glasses	for	both	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	sat	in	rockers	overlooking	the	side	yard,	and	he	eased	his	left	leg	off	with	a sigh,	setting	it	on	the	ground	next	to	the	chair.	He	rubbed	both	hands	in	the stump,	massaging	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	much	better	now,”	Murphy	said.	“Yesterday	it	was	all	he	could	do	to	sit	in his	room	and	read	books;	he	just	didn’t	feel	well	enough	to	go	out.	Thanks	for coming.	I	think	seeing	you	made	a	big	difference.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,	Dad.	I	just	wish	I	could	be	here	more	often.”	As	she	said	the	words, she	felt	guilty.	Visits	to	her	father	were	so	emotionally	charged	that	it	was	almost impossible	for	her	to	visit	more	often,	whatever	the	circumstances	of	her	job. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	reached	for	her	hand.	His	hand	was	large,	calloused	and	scarred,	around	her small,	delicate	hand.	All	the	same,	his	ring	hung	too	loose.	“I	understand.	You’ve got	a	very	demanding	job,	and	an	important	one.	Tell	me,	how’s	it	going	with you	and	David?	You	haven’t	mentioned	him	much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	you	didn’t	like	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I	don’t.	But	he’s	yours.	I	suppose	I	have	to	try.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	down	and	shrugged.	“I	don’t	know	how	things	are	going,	Dad.	Did you	know—with	Mom—when	did	you	know?	I	mean,	that	you	wanted	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>with	her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	it	was	a	little	different	for	us,	I	guess.	We	met	in	grammar	school;	I	was about	twelve	when	we	dated	at	first.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	you	knew—you	really	knew	what	you	wanted	when	you	got	married.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hell,	I	don’t	know.	We	got	married	right	out	of	high	school.	My	father	said	I was	dumb	as	a	post,	and	wouldn’t	ever	amount	to	nothing	if	I	got	married	at eighteen.	But	I	didn’t	want	to	be	with	anyone	else,	and	neither	did	she,	and	we loved	each	other,	and	it	just	made	sense.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	shrugged.	“I	don’t	know	if	I	feel	that	way	about	David.	He’s	pretty	mad right	now—I	was	supposed	to	meet	him	in	New	York	yesterday,	and	had	to cancel.	I	don’t	miss	him	anymore.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	you	need	to	do	what’s	right	for	you.	I	won’t	tell	you	what	to	do;	you wouldn’t	listen	to	me	anyhow.	Follow	your	heart.	You	may	end	up	with	regrets, but	at	least	they’ll	be	worth	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	have	any	regrets,	Dad?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	glanced	over	at	her	and	smiled,	a	stark	smile.	Looking	in	his	eyes	was	like stepping	up	to	the	edge	of	a	cliff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only	that	you	and	Kenny	are	still	so	young	I	can’t	go	with	her,	wherever	she went.	I	miss	her	so	much…	I’d	follow	your	mother	anywhere.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Oh,	Dad.	Don’t	say	that,	we	still	need	you	so	much. </i>	She	changed	the	subject. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	is	Kenny,	really?	Has	he	been	any	better?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	shook	his	head.	“No.	He’s	slowly	getting	worse.	Sometimes	I’m	afraid he’ll	wake	up	one	day	and	not	recognize	me.	He	gets	these	attacks—this	was	the third	one,	excruciating	pain	in	his	wrists	and	hands.	Nobody	can	tell	me	what’s wrong,	it	doesn’t	fit	the	normal	profile	for	ALD.	He	gets	these	mood	swings—</p>
<p class="calibre1">makes	him	seem	more	like	a	two	year	old	than	six.	And	you	know	how	many doctors	and	specialists	I’ve	talked	to,	all	over	the	country.	Last	time	they	had	to put	him	on	a	respirator	to	keep	him	alive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a>She	shook	her	head.	“I	didn’t	know	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	were	at	work	then,	and	it—it	just	didn’t	make	sense	to	call	you	until	I knew…”	His	eyes	watered	and	he	paused.	“It	didn’t	make	sense	to	call	until	I knew	if	he	was	going	to	make	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shook	his	head.	“I	don’t	know	what	I’m	going	to	do,	to	tell	you	the	truth.	I got	the	mess	with	the	insurance	straightened	out,	but	it’s	so	expensive	I’m	only going	to	be	able	to	pay	it	for	about	three	months.	After	that	I	guess…	We	can probably	get	him	on	disability;	I	talked	to	the	social	security	office	about	it.	That may	cover	the	insurance.	He	won’t	be	eligible	for	Medicaid	for	another	year—</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	income	was	too	high.	The	sad	part	is	I	just	wrote	a	check	to	the	IRS	for almost	twenty	thousand	dollars.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	that	was	my	tax	bill	this	year.	I	sold	some	stock	last	year	to	pay	off	some debts—student	loans	and	the	like—I	got	whacked	on	capital	gains.	I	really	could have	used	the	money	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	about	the	Skaggs	bill,	don’t	you?”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	isn’t	he	trying	to	cut	welfare	rolls,	shift	the	money	to	social	security?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	yes,	but	they	are	also	cutting	social	security	disability	and	veterans disability,”	she	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	kidding.	Would	Kenny	be	covered?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	so,	Dad.	He’ll	probably	lose	any	government	assistance,	unless	the state	has	something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“People	are	so	overtaxed	here	by	the	Feds,	the	state	government	has	to	hold	the line.	There’s	not	much	in	the	way	of	services.	I’m	sure	you	deal	with	it	every day,	in	your	job.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can’t	let	that	bill	pass,	if	there’s	anything	you	can	do,	hon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>“That’s	part	of	what	I	wanted	to	talk	with	you	about,	Dad.	I	think—I	think	you can	help.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	noise	of	the	crickets	and	cicadas	drowned	out	the	creak	of	Murphy’s	rocking chair	as	he	sat	on	his	front	porch,	staring	out	at	the	falling	darkness.	Murphy rocked;	the	sound	was	soothing,	a	reminder	of	so	many	nights	before	on	this porch,	listening	to	the	same	sound.	Through	the	trees,	he	saw	headlights	as	a	car passed	on	the	highway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	weeks	had	passed	since	he’d	been	laid	off.	Two	weeks	since	the	bombing, and	the	day	his	son	went	back	to	the	hospital.	Not	much	had	changed.	School would	be	out	in	another	week,	and	normally	Murphy	would	be	worried	about day	care	for	the	summer,	but	that	didn’t	look	to	be	a	problem	this	year.	In	two weeks,	he’d	sent	a	hundred	resumes,	made	fifty	cold	calls,	and	received	no response. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	starting	to	think	there	just	weren’t	any	jobs	out	there	for	him.	He	wasn’t just	looking	at	a	job	change.	After	nineteen	years	with	the	same	company,	he faced	a	complete	career	change.	It	wasn’t	like	there	were	any	chip	manufacturers left	in	the	United	States.	And	he’d	be	damned	if	he’d	move	to	Indonesia,	after serving	his	country	26	years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	the	question	was,	what	could	he	do? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	closed	his	eyes.	If	only	Martha	were	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	thought	brought	a	fresh	bout	of	pain.	They’d	known	each	other	since	third grade,	dated	in	junior	high	and	high	school.	Voted	“Most	Popular	Couple”	by their	senior	class.	Murphy	lost	his	job	with	GM	in	‘90	when	she	was	six	months pregnant	with	Valerie.	She	stood	by	him	while	he	searched	for	work,	with	almost no	luck.	For	a	while	he	found	work	with	a	big	landscaping	company—cutting grass,	that	sort	of	thing.	After	she	had	Valerie,	she	kissed	him	goodbye	and	saw him	off	at	the	airport	when	he	enlisted	in	the	Army. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	lived	together	in	Germany,	at	Fort	Knox,	Kentucky.	He’d	been	deployed	to the	Gulf	War	and	later	the	Balkans.	Whenever	he	left	her	behind,	she	wrote almost	every	day.	After	the	Army,	when	the	position	came	up	at	Saturn’s	new chip	manufacturing	plant	in	West	Virginia,	she’d	picked	up	and	moved	there</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a>with	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	October	2004—by	that	time	he	was	an	officer—his	National	Guard	unit mobilized	and	went	to	Iraq,	where	he’d	seen	more	of	his	share	of	death	and	pain than	anyone	deserved.	He’d	been	gone	over	a	year	that	time,	a	year	he	almost never	talked	about,	but	that	sometimes	haunted	him,	especially	when	he	looked at	his	son	and	remembered	the	children	who’d	died	in	Iraq.	The	year	had	ended with	a	roadside	bomb	that	destroyed	his	humvee,	killing	his	driver	and	shredding Murphy’s	left	leg	below	the	knee.	Martha	had	nursed	him	back	to	health	when he	got	home,	helped	him	work	himself	back	into	shape,	then	stood	by	him	when he	fought	the	Army	National	Guard	to	get	back	on	duty.	Except	for	short	periods training	in	the	Guard,	he’d	never	again	left	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	had	made	their	lives	here,	in	this	ramshackle	old	farmhouse	built	of	grey stone,	with	a	tin	roof	and	a	wraparound	porch.	The	dirt	driveway	led	a	half-mile out	to	US	340.	They	had	experimented	with	various	crops	in	the	fields	closest	to the	house—tomatoes	and	cabbage—but	neither	of	them	were	meant	to	be farmers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over	the	last	two	decades	he	and	Martha	had	redone	the	house’s	interior,	making a	wide	open,	bright	space.	She	loved	music	and	art	and	had	decorated	the	house accordingly,	with	unknown	artists	from	rural	West	Virginia.	Murphy	had	once believed	that	if	she	died,	he	couldn’t	live	a	day	longer.	But	she	died	early,	and left	responsibilities	behind,	and	he	had	to	meet	those	responsibilities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	day	in	February	three	years	ago,	she	had	climbed	into	her	jeep,	driven	out the	two	miles	west	on	340	to	the	gas	station	and	convenience	store,	and	met	her fate	at	the	hands	of	a	seventeen-year-old	drug	addict.	Murphy	had	seen	the security	film.	The	blotches	on	the	boy’s	face	must	have	been	dirt	or	something, because	they	were	gone	at	the	trial.	Unkempt	hair,	pale	skin.	Rail	thin.Too	many late	nights,	Murphy	guessed.	Too	much	drugs.	He	made	off	with	fifty-three dollars,	too	strung	out	or	stupid	to	look	under	the	plastic	cash	drawer,	where three	hundred	dollars	in	twenties	lay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	almost	ten	minutes	before	the	next	customer	came	in,	saw	the	bleeding woman	writhing	in	agony	on	the	floor,	and	called	for	an	ambulance.	Martha’s telephone	sat	on	the	dashboard	in	the	jeep.	Murphy	had	tortured	himself	for months	wondering	why	she	hadn’t	carried	it	into	the	store	with	her,	why	she hadn’t	used	the	compact	9mm	pistol	he’d	taught	her	to	use. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>Walter	died	instantly,	a	survivor	of	a	brutal	war	in	Southeast	Asia	fated	to	die	at the	hands	of	a	teenager	in	his	own	place	of	business.	Martha	might	have	made	it, had	she	not	lost	so	much	blood	lying	on	the	floor	for	ten	minutes,	and	then	the ten	more	before	the	rescue	helicopter	showed	up	to	take	her	to	the	county hospital.	She’d	been	in	emergency	surgery	for	hours;	they	just	couldn’t	revive her.	She	died,	leaving	behind	Murphy,	their	two	children,	and	their	life	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes	Murphy	thought	he	was	dead	too.	The	other	times,	he	wished	he	was. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">May	31</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Mike	Morris	stood,	almost	asleep,	in	the	slow	moving	chow	line, holding	a	foam	tray	soon	to	be	covered	in	unrecognizable	food.	The	chow	line for	the	battalion	headquarters	was	set	up	behind	an	olive	drab	tent,	in	the	shadow of	a	badly	damaged	building.	He	looked	up	when	he	heard	a	shout. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mike!	Mike	Morris!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	Army	major	in	combat	fatigues	and	flak	vest,	helmet	askew,	so	tall	he seemed	to	perch	over	the	other	nearby	officers,	approached	from	the	shadows across	the	street.	With	a	face	covered	in	dark,	coarse	hair	overdue	for	a	shave	by a	day	or	two,	Morris	almost	didn’t	recognize	him.	It	was	Cory	Avedis,	his college	roommate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	be	damned,”	Morris	said.	“Cory!	When	did	you	make	major?	What	are	you doing	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Avedis	bared	his	teeth	and	growled,	then	grabbed	Morris	in	a	bear	hug.	They laughed;	it	had	been	three	years	since	they’d	last	seen	each	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mike.	I	didn’t	expect	to	run	into	you	here,	I	thought	you	were	in	Korea.	What are	you	doing	these	days?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Company	commander—Bravo	Company	First	of	the	Fifteenth	Infantry.	Believe it	or	not,	I	just	took	command	the	same	day	all	this	went	down.	What	about you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	you	know,	same	old	thing.	Skulking	around	in	closets,	reading	other people’s	mail.	Some	timing	you’ve	got.	I	guess	you	get	to	see	your	new	unit perform	in	real	life,	huh?	One	Fifteen	Infantry—I	heard	you	guys	had	an	injury. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	guy	lost	a	leg	or	something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,”	Morris	said.	“Not	in	my	company,	in	Delta.	One	of	the	car	bombs.	He’ll live;	they’ve	got	him	up	at	Walter	Reed.	So	what’s	the	intelligence	perspective on	this	mess?	Any	clues	on	who’s	responsible?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p70"></a>“Officially	it’s	the	DHS’s	ball,	not	Northern	Command.	Zero	evidence	to conclude	this	was	a	foreign	attack—the	news	is	saying	it	was	some	lunatics	up	in West	Virginia,	but	I’ve	got	my	doubts.	Professionals,	if	you	want	my	opinion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Guys	who	used	to	work	for	our	side.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pretty	much	what	Morris	already	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	left	the	chow	line	with	full—if	unappealing—plates,	and	swept	the	soot and	debris	from	a	low	wall	about	a	hundred	yards	away	and	sat	on	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	funny,	I	was	thinking	about	you	the	other	day,”	Avedis	said.	“I	was	down	at Fort	Irwin	last	summer,	and	you’re	not	going	to	believe	who	I	ran	in	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Karen	Greenfield.	Captain	now—at	least	she	was	last	summer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	squinted,	an	odd	twist	in	his	stomach	unsettling	him.  <i class="calibre3">Karen. </i>	He	hadn’t thought	about	Karen	in	a	long	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	a	lie.	He	thought	about	Karen	most	every	day.	“How	was	she?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Her	battalion	was	down	there	for	training.	Would	you	believe	her	weekend warrior	tank	company	knocked	off	a	good	chunk	of	the	opposition	force?	I mean,	nobody	beats	them,	but	her	unit	gave	it	a	good	try.	She’s	in	the	National Guard	now,	works	as	some	kind	of	computer	engineer	in	her	regular	job.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“National	Guard?	Karen?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	it	surprised	me,	too.	Bunch	of	good-old-boy	tankers	with	your	old girlfriend	as	their	commander.	What	do	you	know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	grimaced	at	the	words	“old	girlfriend.”	Avedis	homed	in	on	the expression.	“Still	got	a	thing	for	her,	huh?	Figures;	she	still	looks	pretty	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Man,	if	we	hadn’t	been	all	smelly	in	the	field	for	two	weeks,	I	might	have	tried myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cory,	Alicia	and	I	have	been	happily	married	for	years.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	whatever	you	say.	I	never	understood	why	you	broke	it	off	with	Karen	in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>the	first	place,	but	none	of	my	business.	Hey	man,	I	know	how	it	goes.	Just because	you’re	on	a	diet	doesn’t	mean	you	can’t	look	at	the	menu,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	chuckled	and	his	friend	burst	into	laughter.	He	had	heard	this	particular aphorism	from	Avedis	too	many	times	to	count	when	they	were	in	college.	But then,	Morris	and	Karen	Greenfield	had	dated	the	entire	four	years	of	college, while	Avedis	was	busy	working	his	way	through	the	entire	female	student	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Seriously	though,	how	are	things,	Mike?	You	getting	along	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	looked	at	his	old	friend	and	didn’t	know	what	to	say.	Where	the	hell	did you	start,	when	your	whole	life	wasn’t	yours	anymore?	When	it	hadn’t	been	for years?	When	you	just	closed	your	eyes	and	stepped	off	the	ledge	and	hoped	for the	best	when	you	got	to	the	bottom.	He	should	be	grateful	for	his	life.	His	career was	going	well,	he	had	a	beautiful	wife,	a	wonderful	daughter.	So	why	the	hell wasn’t	it	enough?	Too	much	to	say	to	an	old	friend	out	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	exchanged	current	contact	information,	and	Avedis	excused	himself	to head	back	to	his	unit.	Morris	threw	his	tray	in	an	overflowing	garbage	bin	placed by	the	food	contractors,	and	walked	back	toward	his	company. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	and	Karen	were	together	four	years.	The	wedding	was	planned;	the invitations	mailed.	Then	everything	changed.	During	an	all-night	party	Morris and	Alicia	Skaggs	got	a	little	too	close.	Well,	a	lot	too	close.	Pregnant	close. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	happened	just	before	spring	break	their	senior	year.	The	weather	was	warm, almost	balmy.	Some	of	the	guys	from	the	ROTC	detachment	rented	a	small house	off	campus,	and	that	weekend	they	held	a	long	drunken	party.	Karen	was out	of	town	that	weekend—she	had	studied	computer	engineering	her	last	two years	of	school,	and	that	weekend	attended	a	manufacturers’	conference	in Atlanta,	passing	out	resumes	and	interviewing	with	different	companies.	She	had already	decided	well	before	then	she	wouldn’t	apply	for	Regular	Army,	even though	she	was	one	of	the	top	ROTC	students. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	party	got	way	out	of	hand.	Loud	music,	wild	drinking.	Late	on	Saturday night,	Morris	and	Alicia	sat	out	on	the	tilting	back	porch	of	the	house,	each	of them	drinking	a	beer,	when	Morris	said	something	stupid,	something	like,	“You know,	I’ve	always	been	attracted	to	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a>They	slept	together.	The	next	morning	both	of	them	were	embarrassed	and apologetic,	and	promised	that	would	be	the	end	of	it.	He	would	never	have guessed	that	night	would	derail	his	entire	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	two	weeks	Morris	quaked	with	fear.	He	suffered	a	long	bout	of	diarrhea	and stomach	pains,	and	jerked	every	time	the	phone	rang.	How	would	Karen	react	if she	found	out?	It	had	been	the	stupidest	thing	he’d	ever	done,	but	that	didn’t mean	he	didn’t	love	Karen.	He	couldn’t	imagine	life	without	her.	After	a	couple of	weeks,	he	began	to	calm	down.	In	the	excitement	of	preparing	for	final	exams and	graduation,	Karen	hadn’t	noticed	his	apprehension.	It	looked	like	he	was safe.	He’d	screwed	up,	and	it	would	remain	a	secret,	and	that	was	the	end	of	it, forever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	of	course,	it	wasn’t.	Because	four	weeks	later,	Alicia	appeared	on	his	front step,	eyes	red	from	crying.	She	was	pregnant.  <i class="calibre3">Pregnant.	Christ. </i>	What	were	they going	to	do? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	won’t	kill	my	baby,”	she	said.	No	surprise	there;	she	was	the	leader	of	the campus	“Right-to-Life”	organization.	He’d	always	suspected	in	her	case	there was	more	of	the	politician	there	than	the	moralist—her	father	was	a	powerful congressional	representative	from	Kentucky,	and	she	had	plans	too,	plans	that needed	her	future	husband	to	not	be	in	the	Army. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	like	the	Army	don’t	you,	Mike?”	her	father,	the	son	of	a	bitch,	had	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	want	a	career.”	He	then	proceeded	to	lay	out	the	new	rules,	starting	with the	fact	that	if	Mike	didn’t	marry	Alicia,	Skaggs	would	intervene	in	his	branch assignment.	Instead	of	infantry	or	armor	as	he’d	requested,	he’d	find	himself	a finance	officer	or	worse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	hindsight,	of	course,	Morris	couldn’t	imagine	if	Alicia	had	done	it.	An abortion	would	have	meant	they’d	killed	Savannah	before	she’d	ever	had	a chance	to	live.	His	daughter,	the	best	and	sweetest	little	girl	in	the	world.	There was	little	else	to	be	done	but	tell	Karen	the	truth:	he	was	to	be	a	father.	Of another	woman’s	child. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	on	a	Sunday	afternoon	in	the	beginning	of	May,	about	two	months	before their	planned	wedding,	Morris	called	Karen	and	asked	her	to	meet	him	at	the diner	next	to	the	college.	Morris	got	there	early	and	sat,	fidgeting,	a	golfball	in his	throat,	his	bowels	on	fire,	waiting	for	twenty	minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a>When	she	came	in	the	door	of	the	diner,	the	bell	rang	above	her	head.	She	looked as	beautiful	as	she	ever	had,	in	a	light	blue	sleeveless	sundress	that	highlighted her	blue	eyes,	red	hair	loose	and	hanging	over	her	shoulders.	She	wore	the	silver chain	he’d	given	her	two	years	before,	with	a	tiny	heart-shaped	locket.	She smiled	when	she	saw	him,	sat	down	at	the	battered	table,	reached	out	and touched	his	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	baby,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	opened	his	mouth	and	found	he	couldn’t	speak.	He	blinked	back	a	tear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	mouth	opened	in	surprise.	“Honey,	what’s	wrong?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Karen…”	he	said,	his	voice	low,	his	eyes	on	the	stained	Formica	table	because he	couldn’t	bear	to	look	at	her.	“I’ve	got	something	I	need	to	talk	to	you	about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s	no	easy	way	to	say	this,	and	I	don’t	know	what	it	means	to	us…	and	our future.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	up	at	her,	then	back	down	at	the	table,	unable	to	meet	her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Karen,	when	you	were	in	Atlanta	I	did	something	stupid.	I	was	drunk	and stupid	and	I	…	I…”	He	stopped,	unable	to	continue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	at	her.	She	leaned	close,	her	head	tilted	a	bit	to	the	left,	and	a	single lock	of	hair	fell	over	her	forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	slept	with	someone	else.	I	regretted	it,	and	it	was	the	most	idiotic	thing	I’ve ever	done	and	I’m	sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	face	froze,	and	the	smile	disappeared	forever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	that’s	not	all,	Karen.	She’s	pregnant.	She’s	going	to	have	the	baby.	My baby.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	up	from	the	table	and	met	her	eyes,	and	shivered.	They	were	wide with	shock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	so—so	sorry.	Karen—I	love	you	more	than	anything	else	in	the	world.	I would	never	do	anything	to	hurt	you.	I	am	so	sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a>“What	can’t	the	bitch	get	an	abortion?”	she	said,	her	voice	on	the	edge	of vicious.	Several	of	the	other	people	in	the	diner	looked	over	at	them,	startled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She…thinks	it’s	murder.	She	won’t	consider	it.”	He	didn’t	say	that	her	father was	a	deeply	conservative	congressman.	A	congressman	with	the	power	to	abort Mike	and	Karen’s	careers	into	oblivion.	Mike	was	too	ashamed	to	admit	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	would	never	have	given	into	Skagg’s	attempt	at	intimidation;	no	matter how	much	harm	it	did	their	future.	But	the	Army	didn’t	mean	to	her	what	it	did to	him,	never	would.	And	he	wasn’t	ready	to	give	that	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	eyes	filled	with	tears,	looking	at	him	as	if	she	didn’t	quite	know	what	to	say, and	Mike	thought	his	heart	was	going	to	break.	“Well,	I	guess	that’s	the	end	of it,”	she	said,	her	tone	cold.	She	got	up,	turned	around	and	started	to	walk	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Karen,”	he	called,	desperate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	paused,	almost	as	if	she	were	about	to	turn	around.	His	breath	caught,	he watched	her	take	a	deep	breath,	and	just	for	a	second	he	thought	she	really	was going	to	turn.	Then	she	straightened	her	back	and	walked	away,	out	the	door	and out	of	his	life.	The	bell	rang	over	her	head,	and	he	never	forgot	the	sound.	The two	of	them	hadn’t	spoken	since. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thinking	about	it	now,	seven	years	later,	wouldn’t	do	him	any	good.	He	had more	important	things	to	worry	about	now.	Like	keeping	his	company	safe.	Like keeping	his	marriage	together,	when	there	wasn’t	anything	left	to	keep	it	that way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	the	same,	as	he	tried	to	go	to	sleep	that	night,	he	still	saw	her	in	the	summer dress,	her	blue	eyes	and	the	way	they’d	made	him	shiver,	her	white	teeth shining…	even	her	back	as	she	walked	away.	He	could	still	hear	the	bell	ringing. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	Six</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">June	7</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	key	was	stiff	in	the	lock:	it	hadn’t	been	opened	in	nearly	three	years.	Finally, the	bolt	drew	back,	and	Murphy	opened	the	door	to	the	shop	and	stepped	inside, the	real	estate	agent	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry	about	the	dust,”	he	said.	“I	haven’t	been	in	here	in	a	long	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside,	Martha’s	florist	shop	was	largely	empty.	Display	tables	had	been	cleared of	flowers	three	years	ago,	and	everything	lay	under	a	quarter-inch	of	dust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	agent	looked	around,	leaving	footprints	as	she	walked	to	the	back.	Murphy stood	at	the	door	and	watched	her	explore,	strangely	unwilling	to	go	any	further. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	owned	the	building	outright,	had	been	unwilling	to	sell	it	after	Martha	died. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	her	death,	she’d	had	a	thriving	business	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	agent	said,	“Everything	seems	to	be	in	good	shape.	You’ll	need	to	have	it cleaned	and	repainted,	and	I’ll	need	to	get	an	inspector	in	here	to	make	sure nothing’s	been	chewing	on	the	wiring.	Has	the	power	been	turned	off?	The water?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	right.	You	can	take	care	of	the	painting	and	whatnot.	I	can’t	spend	much time	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded.	“I	understand.	You	know,	it’s	really	too	bad	you	didn’t	sell	it	last year,	when	we	talked.	I	could	have	easily	gotten	you	four	hundred	thousand, then.	Now,	it	won’t	be	so	easy.	Not	unless	those	union	folks	manage	to	get	the plant	back	open	somehow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	it	that	bad?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I’m	afraid	so.	Worst	it’s	ever	been,	at	least	since	I’ve	been	selling	in	the county.	Lot’s	of	houses	on	the	market,	and	no	one	buying.	I	think	we	can probably	get	a	hundred,	maybe	a	hundred-fifty	thousand	for	the	shop.	I	wouldn’t recommend	listing	it	for	any	more	than	that,	not	if	you	want	to	it	to	sell	this year.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>The	statement	hit	him	like	a	blow.  <i class="calibre3">One	hundred	thousand	dollars. </i>	He’d	finally received	the	paperwork	from	Saturn	for	continuing	Kenny’s	health	insurance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	would	run	him	over	five	thousand	a	month	alone.	His	VA	disability	check was	less	than	ten	percent	of	that,	and	unemployment,	when	it	started,	wouldn’t make	much	of	a	dent	either.	He’d	run	through	a	hundred	thousand	pretty	quickly, especially	if	there	was	another	trip	to	the	hospital. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">No	choice. </i>	“Do	what	you	need	to	do.	I’m	going	to	need	every	cent	I	can	put	my hands	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	agent	left	soon	afterward,	leaving	him	to	think	about	the	town	meeting	to	be held	tonight,	wishing	he	could	be	two	places	at	once.	The	crowd	that	had	been talking	about	purchasing	the	plant	was	meeting	at	the	high	school	gym,	but	he’d be	in	Washington	by	then,	preparing	to	testify	in	front	of	a	Congressional committee	at	the	request	of	his	daughter.	He	must	be	getting	old.	It	was	too much	change,	too	fast. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Too	fast. </i>	He	looked	around	the	shop	where	Martha	had	made	her	life	and	fought to	hold	back	tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	Greenfield	arrived	twenty	minutes	early,	but	still	ended	up	parked	almost a	quarter	mile	away	from	the	high	school,	on	the	shoulder	of	the	road	behind	a long	line	of	vehicles.	Cars	and	trucks	jammed	the	parking	lot	and	the	shoulders of	the	road	for	a	fair	distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	she	parked	and	began	walking	up	the	crowded	street,	two	unfamiliar	men in	grey	suits	caught	her	attention.	Both	carried	digital	cameras	and	walked	from vehicle	to	vehicle,	taking	photographs	of	the	license	plates.	Karen	stared	in disbelief	as	the	couple	walking	ahead	of	her	noticed	the	two	men	and	crossed	the street	to	avoid	encountering	them.	She	stood	watching	the	men	as	they	went from	car	to	car.	Who	the	hell	were	they?	Corporate	security?	Some	kind	of	paid informants?	With	a	burst	of	anger,	she	walked	toward	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	short	one,	no	older	than	twenty-five,	looked	up	at	her	approach	with	a frown.	He	tapped	his	partner’s	shoulder	and	pointed,	just	before	she	reached them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse	me.	What	are	you	doing?”	Karen	demanded. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a>The	older	one,	a	balding	man	with	a	bushy	mustache,	said,	“I	think	you	need	to mind	your	own	business,	lady.	This	ain’t	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,”	she	said.	She	opened	her	purse	and	both	men	straightened.	One	of them	slipped	his	hand	into	his	jacket.	She	tensed;	she	hadn’t	thought	corporate security	would	be	armed.	She	took	out	her	phone	and	dialed	911. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	lady.	What	are	you	doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	you	need	to	mind	 <i class="calibre3">your</i>	own	business.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	rings,	then	she	heard,	“Jefferson	County	Emergency.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi,	I’m	calling	from	outside	Highview	High	School,	on	Route	340.	I’m	on	my way	to	the	town	meeting	here,	and	there	are	two	suspicious	men	walking	from car	to	car	with	cameras.	I	think	they	may	be	trying	to	steal	something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	lady,	you	can’t	do	that,”	the	younger	one	said,	his	face	red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	older	one	shook	his	head,	then	took	a	wallet-sized	folder	out	of	his	coat pocket,	opened	it,	and	held	it	out	to	her.	She	glanced	at	the	folder,	and	felt	her frown	deepen.	Department	of	Homeland	Security. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	send	a	patrol	car	out	there,”	the	dispatcher	said	on	the	phone.	“Can	I	have your	name	please?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Should	she	tell	the	dispatcher	she’d	made	a	mistake?	No.	Better	have	the	cops come;	these	guys	might	not	be	legitimate	anyway.	She	gave	the	information	to the	dispatcher	as	the	older	of	the	two	agents	stood,	arms	crossed	over	his	chest, looking	at	her	with	lips	curled	up	in	amusement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	she	disconnected	and	put	her	phone	back	in	her	purse,	the	older	of	the	two agents	said,	“You	didn’t	want	to	do	that.	We’re	not	people	you	want	to	piss	off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	that	so?	Well,	maybe	I’m	not	a	person	to	piss	off,	either.	You	want	my	license plate	number?	Since	when	did	coming	to	a	town	meeting	become	suspicious behavior?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,	lady,	as	a	matter	of	fact	we’re	on	the	trail	of	a	suspected	terrorist.	You	are in	our	way,	and	I	suggest	you	move	on	and	mind	your	own	business.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a>The	younger	one	wrote	in	his	notebook,	then	looked	up	at	her.	“You	told	the dispatcher	your	name	was	Karen	Greenfield?	Is	that	spelled	how	it	sounds? </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’ll	need	it	for	our	report.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	it	is.	G-R-E-E-N-F-I-E-L-D.	I’m	in	the	phonebook.	How	do	I	spell	your name?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	sardonic	smile	on	his	face,	the	older	one	handed	her	a	business	card.	Lawrence Harris,	it	said.	Special	Agent.	She	put	the	card	in	her	pocket,	and,	with exaggerated	motion,	walked	around	the	men	and	continued	toward	the	high school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	walked	into	a	wall	of	sound	when	she	entered	the	gym.	It	looked	like	two thousand	people	were	jammed	into	the	room,	employees	at	the	plant	and	their families.	She	climbed	to	the	top	of	one	of	the	bleachers,	sat	down	and	started shaking.	Who	the	hell	did	those	guys	think	they	were?	Why	would	the	DHS	be interested	in	a	town	meeting? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Below,	she	saw	something	more	chilling.	Two	more	men	dressed	in	dark	suits, taking	photographs	of	the	crowd.	The	men	and	women	nearest	them	recoiled, dread	and	anger	on	their	faces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Too	bad	Murphy	wasn’t	here.	She’d	met	him	for	lunch	earlier	that	day,	and	they had	discussed	the	upcoming	meeting,	but	he	was	driving	to	Washington	tonight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	morning,	he	would	be	testifying	before	a	Congressional	hearing.  <i class="calibre3">We	need</i> <i class="calibre3">him	here, </i>	she	thought.	She	thought	of	him	as	a	father,	certainly	more	of	a	father than	her	drunk	of	a	real	father	had	ever	been.	He’d	be	furious	to	know	there	were federal	agents	stalking	around	taking	pictures	of	everyone,	making	notes	on	who attended	a	town	meeting	in	a	small	town	in	West	Virginia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	were	they	doing	here	anyway?	Terrorist,	hell.	She	knew	what	it	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Saturn’s	CEO,	Nelson	Barclay,	was	a	high-dollar	campaign	contributor	for	the President.	He’d	probably	picked	up	the	phone	and	called	someone	at	DHS	to suggest	that	the	people	whose	livelihoods	he’d	stolen	were	potential	terrorists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bastards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	meeting	started	late.	About	fifteen	minutes	after	her	arrival,	three	vaguely familiar	men	walked	to	the	stage	at	the	front	of	the	gym.	A	podium	stood	at	the head	of	the	room.	One	of	the	men	spoke	into	the	microphone. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a>“Testing.”	The	noise	of	the	crowd	abated	somewhat,	and	he	spoke	again.	“Okay everyone,	let’s	go	ahead	and	get	this	show	on	the	road.	Most	of	you	know	me, but	for	the	federal	agents	in	the	room,	I’ll	introduce	myself.”	The	room	erupted in	laughter,	and	one	of	the	agents	flushed	red.	“I’m	Tim	Wagner,	and	I’ve worked	at	the	Saturn	plant	since	the	day	it	opened	just	after	the	turn	of	the century.	In	the	last	couple	weeks,	I’ve	been	working	with	a	number	of	the	other folks	here	in	the	room	to	put	together	a	union,	so	we	can	deal	with	the	plant collectively	and	maybe	get	ourselves	out	of	the	situation	we’re	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	me	tell	you	the	way	I	see	it.	Highview	is	a	small	town.	Our	population	at the	last	census	came	in	at	just	under	six	thousand	people.	The	single	biggest employer	in	town	is	Saturn:	eight	hundred	people,	not	to	mention	all	of	the businesses	supported	by	the	plant.	Folks,	this	is	a	full-fledged	disaster.	If	we don’t	come	up	with	a	way	to	respond,	we	can	just	forget	about	our	homes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Highview	will	be	a	ghost	town	in	six	months.	If	you	got	equity	in	your	house, forget	about	it.	Who’s	going	to	buy	your	house	if	there’re	no	jobs	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	crowd	roiled.	Karen	had	been	thinking	the	same	thing	for	some	time,	but	it was	clear	from	the	reaction	that	not	everyone	in	the	crowd	had	been. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,	a	few	of	us	got	together	right	after	the	plant	shut	down,	and	we	worked with	an	attorney,	who	put	together	the	legal	documents	for	us	to	put	together	a company.	And	we	got	agreement	from	the	Bank	of	Jefferson	County	to	provide us	with	a	loan	to	buy	the	plant	outright.	The	bank	sure	sees	the	value	in operating	it	independently.	Here’s	what	we	were	thinking.	The	plant	is profitable.	Let’s	buy	it	from	Saturn,	license	their	chip	designs	and	operate	it	as our	own	company.	We	can	diversify	as	we	go	along.	We	could	be	independent, run	our	own	company.	We	don’t	need	any	outside	company	to	come	in	and	run things	for	us.	So,	we	put	together	a	proposal	and	last	week	we	drove	down	to Virginia	to	meet	with	Mr.	Nelson	Barclay.	Do	you	know	what	he	said?	Do	you know	what	he	told	us	when	we	made	our	good	faith	offer?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	in	the	crowd	shouted,	“What	did	he	tell	you,	Tim?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	tell	you	what	he	told	us.	He	told	us	he	could	make	more	from	the	plant	by selling	it	as	scrap	metal,	and	he	planned	to	auction	everything	off.	He’d	rather scrap	it	than	risk	having	us	do	better	without	him.	He	said	he	wouldn’t	sell	it	at any	price.	He’d	rather	kill	our	town	than	give	us	a	chance	to	move	forward.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>The	noise	level	in	the	room	rose	as	the	crowd	shouted.	Loud	catcalls	rose	from the	back	of	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	not	the	worst	part,	folks.	The	son	of	bitch—excuse	my	French—had	the gall	to	tell	me	he	might	have	been	more	considerate	of	our	needs	if	we’d	listened when	the	company	endorsed	President	Price	during	the	elections,	since	our precinct	voted	almost	seventy	percent	for	Senator	Wilson.	So	I	ask	you, Highview,	what	are	we	going	to	do?	What	are	we	going	to	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	man	she’d	never	seen	before,	about	halfway	toward	the	back	of	the	room, stood	up	and	shouted,	“I’ll	tell	you	what	we	can	do,	Tim!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">That	was	staged, </i>	she	thought.	The	man	who	had	stood	and	spoke	sat conveniently	next	to	the	aisle,	and	the	reply	was	too	polished	to	be	anything other	than	rehearsed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	tell	you	what	we’ll	do,	folks,”	he	shouted	as	he	walked	forward.	“We’ll	just have	to	convince	Mr.	Nelson	so-high-and-mighty	Barclay	we	mean	business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’ll	tell	him	it’s	better	for	him	to	work	with	us	than	work	against	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	reached	the	stage,	took	the	microphone	from	Wagner	and	spoke.	She	got	her first	good	look	as	he	reached	the	stage.	An	older	man,	possibly	in	his	fifties,	in jeans	and	a	flannel	shirt.	He	had	mud	on	his	boots,	and	his	graying	hair	was cropped	close. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Folks,	most	of	you	know	me.	My	name	is	Dale	Whitt.	My	father	lived	in Highview,	and	my	grandfather	lived	in	Highview.	My	great-grandfather	lived down	in	Logan	County,	and	moved	up	here	after	the	Army	shot	him.	See,	back in	1921	my	great-grandfather	was	crippled	courtesy	of	a	gunshot	from	the United	States	Army,	when	the	coal	workers	in	southern	West	Virginia	saw	fit	to ask	for	better	working	conditions.	Instead	of	living	in	a	dump	and	dying	down	in those	mines,	they	wanted	to	earn	a	decent	wage.	And	you	know	what	happened? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	coal	companies	sent	in	their	own	private	armies,	backed	up	by	the	good	old US	of	A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	my	town,	not	Nelson	Barclay’s.	This	is	your	town.	Not	Saturn Microsystems’s.	My	family	paid	in	blood	for	the	right	to	live	and	prosper	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	did	yours.	Are	you	going	to	let	some	outsider	from	pointy-headed	Vienna, Virginia	tell	you	your	livelihood	is	worth	more	as	scrap	metal?	Or	are	you	going to	stand	up	for	yourselves?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>A	roar	rose	from	the	crowd.	Some	yelled	and	waved	their	fists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	tell	you	what	you’re	going	to	do.	Tomorrow	morning,	you’re	going	to	show up	for	work.	You’re	going	to	break	the	locks	off	the	gate,	march	in	there,	and start	making	chips.	And	they	aren’t	going	to	turn	you	out	until	you	get	a	fair deal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	crowd	went	wild	with	shouting,	excitement,	and	the	bleachers	under	her	feet shook	as	the	men	and	women	around	her	pounded	their	feet.	The	enthusiasm swept	over	Karen.	Why	should	these	people	who	had	put	their	entire	lives	into this	company—into	this	town—give	up	everything	because	the	company	wanted to	save	a	little	more	money	and	pay	a	bigger	dividend? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	spoke	again.	“See,	unlike	a	hundred	years	ago,	we’ll	have	the	press	on	our side.	We’ll	have	the	whole	country	watching	when	you	go	back	into	that	plant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	won’t	be	able	to	send	in	a	private	Army	to	take	us	out.	They	won’t	be	able to	send	in	thugs	to	shoot	at	working	folks.	They’ll	have	to	let	you	do	your	jobs	in peace,	so	we	can	make	our	own	way.  <i class="calibre3">Our	own	way! </i>	Do	you	hear	me, Highview?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shouts	came	from	the	crowd	in	response. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	going	to	take	back	your	jobs,	Highview?	Are	you	going	to	take	control of	your	destiny?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	crowd	went	wild	with	excitement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	right,	we	 <i class="calibre3">will</i>	do	it.	And	we	will	win,	because	right	is	on	our	side.	We will	win,	because	we	are	the	sons	of	liberty.	We	will	win	because	God	is	on	the side	of	the	meek	and	the	poor!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	room	broke	up	into	loud	cheers	and	applause,	and	everyone	stood.	For almost	five	minutes	no	one	could	hear	a	word	Whitt	shouted	over	the	noise	of the	crowd.	Karen	stood	and	shouted	with	the	rest	of	them.	Whitt	made	sense, damn	it.	Why	should	one	person	be	able	to	make	a	decision	that	ruined	hundreds of	families’	lives?	Why	should	one	person	be	able	to	determine	the	fate	of	an entire	town? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	she	glanced	back	toward	the	doors,	where	four	men	in	dark	suits	and	ties stood,	each	of	them	with	a	camera.	They	stood	there,	the	only	people	in	the	room</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a>not	clapping. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	Seven</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">June	8</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	chair	of	the	House	Health	and	Welfare	Committee	called	the	hearing	to order	at	five	minutes	after	ten	in	the	morning.	The	room,	one	of	the	largest	and most	ornate	hearing	rooms	in	the	Rayburn	Building,	held	at	least	a	couple	of hundred	people,	and	from	his	seat	just	behind	the	witness	table	Murphy	could see	that	all	the	seats	were	filled.	Men	and	women	stood	in	the	back	of	the	room, and	the	area	between	the	witness	tables	and	the	raised	semicircular	dais	where the	twenty-five	committee	members	sat	was	crammed	with	reporters	and cameramen,	who	sat	on	the	floor.	Behind	the	witness	tables	were	thirty	rows	of chairs,	the	first	row	reserved	for	witnesses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sitting	on	the	dais	facing	the	audience,	Representative	Clark	sat	toward	the	left side	of	the	room,	near	the	windows.	The	other	members	of	the	committee	were arrayed	in	a	semicircle	on	either	side	of	him.	Valerie	was	just	to	Clark’s	left,	in	a row	of	chairs	behind	the	members	of	congress,	reserved	for	aides.	She	looked pensive	as	she	leaned	forward	and	said	something	to	the	Congressman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	was	as	uncomfortable	as	he’d	ever	been.	He	wore	his	dress	uniform today,	with	all	his	awards	and	decorations,	and	sat	stiffly,	waiting	for	the	hearing to	begin.	He	hadn’t	expected	this	hearing	to	gain	so	much	attention,	and wondered	again	if	he	should	really	be	here.	He	wasn’t	political.	He	hardly	voted, except	for	Presidential	elections.	Martha	would	have	laughed	at	his	discomfort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	self-confidence	would	have	propelled	her	through	any	situation,	but	for Murphy,	the	politics	and	intrigues	of	Washington	were	too	treacherous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	head	of	the	room,	Clark	seemed	tense,	his	back	ramrod	straight,	and looked	straight	ahead	as	Valerie	continued	speaking	in	his	ear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	minutes	after	nine,	every	member	of	the	committee	was	seated.	Valerie had	once	told	him	that	for	most	hearings,	only	a	few	representatives	showed	up, and	they	rarely	stayed	for	the	entire	hearing.	But	this	one	was	getting	a	lot	of attention	from	the	national	press,	and	he	supposed	most	congressmen	and women	couldn’t	pass	up	the	opportunity	to	get	some	free	ink.	Murphy	looked around	the	room,	wishing	he	could	make	for	the	exit. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a>Too	late.	The	chairman	slammed	his	gavel	into	the	table	and	called	the committee	to	order. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	Ladies	and	Gentleman,	let’s	call	this	hearing	to	order.	We	are	meeting today	to	conduct	our	review	of	H.R.	172,	the	Fiscal	Responsibility	Act, introduced	by	Representative	Mark	Skaggs	of	Kentucky.	Now,	there	is	a	great deal	of	in	interest	in	this	bill,	so	I	would	first	of	all	like	to	ask	our	spectators despite	the	crowding	to	please	stay	quiet	and	not	disrupt	the	proceedings.	We’ll start	with	the	gentleman	from	Kentucky,	Mr.	Skaggs.	You	have	five	minutes, sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mark	Skaggs	sat	to	the	right	of	the	dais,	almost	directly	across	the	semicircle from	Clark.	Skaggs	was	a	slight	man	with	a	narrow	face,	high	cheekbones	and blonde	hair.	He	looked	younger	than	his	nearly	fifty-five	years,	and	Murphy caught	himself	wondering	if	Skaggs	had	undergone	cosmetic	surgery.	He	began his	statement	and	Murphy	leaned	back,	barely	following	‘his	convoluted argument.	He	seemed	to	go	on	interminably,	droning	about	the	fiscal	status	of the	country,	deficits	and	trade	balances,	welfare	statistics	and	God	only	knew what	else.	Murphy	looked	down	at	his	hands,	folded	in	his	lap.	It	was	long	past time	for	him	to	leave,	but	he	couldn’t	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	audience	and	the	reporters	in	the	room	stirred	as	Skaggs	completed	his statement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	chairman	said,	“Thank	you,	sir.	The	Chair	recognizes	the	gentleman	from West	Virginia.	You	have	five	minutes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	leaned	to	his	microphone	and	glanced	down	at	Murphy,	meeting	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	sir.	I	shall	be	brief.	Ladies	and	gentlemen,	when	I	think	about	this question,	I	have	to	think	about	the	people	who	elected	me	to	come	to Washington	to	represent	them.	I	have	to	think	about	the	coal	miners,	and	the factory	workers,	and	the	engineers,	and	the	farmers,	the	mountain	folks	of	my home.	I	think	about	the	many,	many	poor	people	who	have	struggled	for	what	is theirs,	only	to	see	staggering	tax	rates	that	no	one	could	have	believed	a generation	ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	to	think	about	the	men	and	women	of	my	district,	such	as	the	eight hundred	families	in	Highview,	West	Virginia,	who	lost	their	jobs	and	their livelihoods	three	weeks	ago.	I	might	add	they	lost	their	careers	as	well.	There	are</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a>no	more	computer	chip	manufacturers	left	in	the	United	States	of	America, which	means	there	is	nowhere	left	to	ply	their	skills.	Eight	hundred	families	in my	district	were	given	a	simple	choice:	change	careers,	start	over	from	scratch and	maybe	lose	everything,	or	leave	the	country.	Come	to	Jakarta,	they	were told,	to	the	workers’	paradise,	made	so	on	the	backs	of	hardworking	Americans who	lost	their	livelihood.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ladies	and	gentlemen,	these	are	not	crack	mommies	or	drug	addicts.	These	are not	the	liars	and	cheats	my	esteemed	colleague	Mr.	Skaggs	speaks	of.	No,	these are	hardworking	Americans,	who	have	served	their	country	in	wartime	and served	their	communities	in	peacetime.	And	yes,	most	of	them	are	going	to	need a	little	help.	A	little	help	starting	over	in	their	devastated	community.	Maybe	a little	help	paying	for	medical	care	for	their	children.	Until	they	can	start	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	bill	will	take	that	helping	hand	away	and	replace	it	with	a	fist.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	let	out	a	sigh	and	took	a	drink	of	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Chair,	I’d	like	to	request	unanimous	consent	to	revise	and	extend	my remarks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	be	it,	Mr.	Clark,	and	thank	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	stretched.	He	was	on	the	second	panel—still	a	long	ways	away.	The Chair	introduced	the	first	panel,	a	passel	of	government	beauracrats	who	were going	to	talk	about	numbers	and	policies	far	removed	from	reality.	Murphy leaned	back	in	his	chair	and	prepared	for	a	long,	dull	morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	quiet	in	Highview.	Too	quiet,	as	far	as	Karen	was	concerned.	She	had arrived	at	seven	that	morning,	as	agreed.	About	half	an	hour	later,	they	made	a great	ceremony	of	using	bolt	cutters	to	shear	off	the	padlock	holding	the	new gates	shut,	and	the	workers	began	to	stream	in,	preparing	for	the	day.	As	she passed	the	gate,	she	saw	the	Sheriff	and	one	of	his	deputies,	leaning	against	their cars	and	watching	the	employees	stream	past.	They	did	nothing	to	stop	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	reporters	or	news	vans	in	front	of	the	factory.	That	surprised	and	troubled her.	She	would	have	expected	eight	hundred	workers	marching	back	into	their closed	factory	to	at	least	make	the	local	news,	but	the	press	was	nowhere	to	be seen.	Maybe	they	would	appear	later,	but	that	seemed	doubtful.	The	dramatic</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a>moment	to	air	on	TV	would	have	been	the	cutting	of	the	locks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	any	event,	she	went	to	the	lab	in	the	Quality	Assurance	department,	where	her job	was	to	select	random	samples	and	perform	a	variety	of	tests	to	ensure	the chips	met	performance	standards.	The	familiar	white,	carpetless	room	with	wide counters,	bright	lights	and	large	workbenches	made	coming	back	to	work	feel almost	like	coming	home.	At	least	all	the	home	she	had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	has	grown	up	in	Hardburly,	Kentucky:	coal	country,	way	the	hell	out	in the	middle	of	nowhere	near	the	junction	of	West	Virginia,	Kentucky	and Virginia.	Her	dad,	chronically	unemployed,	spent	most	of	her	formative	years mean	and	drunk.	Right	after	the	turn	of	the	century,	before	Karen	was	even twelve,	the	son	of	a	bitch	began	to	eye	her	in	a	way	that	scared	hell	out	of	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	late	winter	night	he’d	arrived	home	drunk	and	beaten	Karen’s	mother	to death.	Karen	might	have	been	next,	had	the	neighbors	not	heard	the	screaming and	called	the	county	Sheriff.	The	Perry	County	Child	Welfare	Department placed	her	in	a	foster	home,	her	dad	went	to	prison,	and	that	would	have	been	the end	of	it	except	that	sometimes	she	could	still	hear	her	mother	screaming,	though it	was	half	a	lifetime	ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	nothing	else,	her	dad	taught	her	one	thing—to	never	depend	on	anyone	but herself.	In	high	school,	Karen	joined	the	wrestling	team	and	Junior	ROTC,	and the	first	time	one	of	her	foster	brothers	touched	her	the	wrong	way	she	broke	his arm.	Nothing	made	her	happier	than	the	day	she	left	Hardburly	behind	forever, on	an	Army	scholarschip	at	Bowling	Green. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now,	for	the	first	time	since	Mike	Morris	had	suddenly	dumped	her	before graduation	from	college,	she	felt	lost,	directionless.	Maybe	Murphy	was	right, and	she	should	try	to	get	transferred	to	the	regular	Army.	Somehow	she	had	the feeling	that	despite	the	plant	takeover,	this	would	be	a	temporary	thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Temporary	or	not,	she	had	a	job	to	do	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sat	down	and	logged	into	her	computer,	and	then	checked	her	email. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing	but	junk	had	come	in	since	the	plant	had	closed;	no	workers,	so	no	one to	send	mail.	She	had	received	one	note	from	the	Bowling	Green	Alumni Association,	asking	for	money.	Delete	that	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">About	twenty	minutes	later,	David	Firkus	showed	up	at	the	door	with	a	cart	full</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>of	chips.	“First	load	of	the	day,	Karen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	Dave.	It’s	good	to	see	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	too,	Karen,	you	too.	I’m	very	happy	to	be	back	at	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	an	IQ	of	68,	David	had	grown	up	in	nearby	Harpers	Ferry,	attending	a school	for	disabled	children,	which	had	placed	him	in	the	job	here	at	Saturn almost	fifteen	years	ago.	He	had	a	simple	job:	take	the	loads	of	freshly manufactured	chips	from	the	line	up	to	Quality	Assurance,	then	pick	them	up later	and	take	them	to	packaging.	He	made	a	variety	of	other	deliveries	around the	building,	as	well.	It	did	take	a	great	deal	of	care,	as	the	equipment	was delicate.	So	far	as	she	knew,	he	had	never	damaged	one.	His	job	could	probably be	automated,	but	management	had	been	happy	with	his	work	and	happy	to provide	the	job. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had	not	thought	about	him	since	the	plant	closed.	Realizing	that	was	like	an accusation.	She	wondered	what	he	had	been	doing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How’ve	you	been,	Dave—you	know,	since	the	plant	closed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	pretty	good.	I	had	to	move	out	of	my	apartment.	I	wasn’t	too	happy	about that.	I	moved	back	into	my	old	room	with	my	Mom.	But	that’s	okay,	I	like	to watch	her	fish,	and	I	might	be	able	to	get	a	new	job	at	Al’s	Pizza.	Except	I	don’t need	a	new	job	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	don’t	put	all	your	eggs	in	one	basket,”	Karen	said.	“We	don’t	know	for sure	if	the	plant	will	stay	open,	so	you	might	consider	taking	the	job	at	the	pizza place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.	That’s	what	my	Mom	said.	But	I	missed	everyone	at	the	plant.	And	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	blushed,	right	to	the	roots	of	his	hair,	and	started	to	back	out	of	the	office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See	you	later,	Karen,”	he	called.	He	stumbled	as	he	backed	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Careful,	Dave.”	She	paused,	and	then	called,	loud	enough	to	be	heard	in	the hall,	“I	missed	you,	too,	Dave.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	the	truth,	too.	She	wasn’t	the	most	social	person	on	earth,	but	being	at home	all	day…	not	her	cup	of	tea.	Dave	was	a	nice	guy,	and	he	cared	about people.	She	felt	bad	she	hadn’t	checked	up	on	him	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a>Karen	reached	for	her	jeweler’s	glasses.	There	was	a	small	microscope	mounted on	the	left	eye.	By	changing	the	focus	on	the	lens,	she	could	examine	objects	as small	as	five	microns	and	see	if	there	were	any	obvious	blemishes	on	the	chips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Picking	out	a	dozen	or	so,	she	examined	them,	placed	them	on	a	small	plastic tray,	and	then	carried	them	over	to	the	testing	station,	where	they	would	be inserted	into	a	socket	and	tested	for	functionality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	up	when	she	heard	a	low	rumble	outside.	It	was	a	sound	she’d	heard a	thousand	times	in	the	Army:	the	tracks	of	an	armored	vehicle,	very	faint.	She shook	her	head.	Her	imagination	was	way	too	vivid.	It	must	be	a	bulldozer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Except	she	knew	for	sure	there	was	no	construction	anywhere	around	here	now that	the	fences	were	all	finished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	there	was	no	question	now:	a	low	diesel	thrum,	tracks	banging	on	the	road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	the	distinct	whine	of	a	tank’s	turbine	engine.	Possible	a	Bradley,	or	a personnel	carrier.	She	set	the	tray	of	chips	down	and	walked,	very	slowly,	toward the	window,	which	overlooked	the	parking	lot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Remembering	the	words	of	one	of	the	speakers	last	night,	Dale	Whitt,	something about	his	grandfather	being	shot	by	the	Army	during	a	strike,	it	made	her shudder,	and	even	feel	afraid.	But	only	briefly.	What	was	she	thinking?	This	was the	twenty-first	century,	not	the	nineteenth.	His	story	probably	wasn’t	even	true. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	outer	wall	began	to	shake	and	a	shadow	passed	overhead,	followed	by	the overpowering	sound	of	more	than	one	helicopter.	The	window	rattled	in	its frame.	Karen	looked	out	in	disbelief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Four	military	helicopters	landed	at	the	far	end	of	the	parking	lot.	Their	tails swung	around	in	unison,	their	miniguns	pointed	at	the	factory,	and	they disgorged	black-clad	riot	troops:	all	wearing	black	combat	gear	and	helmets,	and carrying	rifles.	Many	had	plastic	shields	as	well,	labeled	the	same	as	the	backs	of their	flak	vests:	DHS. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	ducked	away	from	the	window.  <i class="calibre3">What	the	hell? </i>	Occupying	the	factory	might be	illegal,	but	it	wasn’t	like	they	were	a	bunch	of	armed	crazies.	They	were civilians,	workers	with	families,	not	terrorists.	She	was	an	officer	in	the goddamned	National	Guard.	Who	the	hell	would	send	in	antiterrorist	troops	for something	like	this?	She	reached	for	her	phone	in	a	panic,	her	hands	shaking.	If nothing	else,	she	had	to	call	Murphy.	He	needed	to	know	what	was	happening</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a>here.	She	didn’t	want	to	think	about	what	might	happen	if	anyone	in	the	factory was	armed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	heard	the	beep	of	his	phone	and	cursed	under	his	breath,	just	as	he	sat down	at	the	witness	table.	He	pulled	out	his	phone.	Karen	Greenfield.	She	could wait;	he	would	call	her	after	the	hearing.	He	hit	the	power	button	and	tucked	the phone	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	chairman	said,	“Please	rise	and	raise	your	right	hand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	and	the	other	two	witnesses	stood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	swear	to	tell	the	truth,	the	whole	truth,	and	nothing	but	the	truth,	so	help you	God?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	do,”	Murphy	responded	with	the	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	may	sit.	I	believe	the	gentleman	from	West	Virginia	would	like	to introduce	our	first	witness.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	sat	and	laid	his	hands	flat	on	the	burnished	table.	A	pitcher	of	ice	water sat	at	the	center	of	the	table	with	several	short	glasses.	He	poured	himself	a glass,	and	then	glanced	up	at	his	daughter,	still	sitting	behind	Clark.	She	looked cool	and	competent	up	there.	Martha	would	have	been	proud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Albert	Clark	sat	up	and	said,	“Thank	you,	Mr.	Chairman.	I	would	like	to introduce	to	the	committee	an	upstanding	resident	of	my	district.	The	witness, Lieutenant	Colonel	Kenneth	Murphy,	is	a	former	Director	at	the	Highview manufacturing	plant	of	Saturn	Microsystems,	which,	as	some	of	you	may	know, shut	its	doors	three	weeks	ago	in	order	to	squeeze	more	profit	out	of	a	factory overseas.	As	you	can	see,	he	is	a	serving	officer	in	the	West	Virginia	National Guard	and	is	commander	of	the	Second	Battalion,	Four-hundred	and	thirty-second	Tank	Regiment.	He	has	served	in	two	wars	for	our	country,	the	first	as	a young	enlisted	man	and	later	as	a	company	commander.	During	his	tour	in	Iraq, he	lost	his	left	leg	below	the	knee,	but	pushed	himself	until	he	was	again	able	to meet	the	physical	training	standards	and	remain	in	the	National	Guard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	is	the	recipient	of	a	Bronze	Star	for	Valor	and	the	Purple	Heart.	This	man	is</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>one	of	the	heroes	of	my	district:	a	loving	husband	to	a	wife	who	was	murdered three	years	ago,	a	loving	father	of	two	children.	One	is	a	Harvard	graduate,	the other	six	years	old	and	suffering	from	a	degenerative	nerve	ailment	for	which there	is	no	cure.	Colonel	Murphy	has	come	here	to	tell	us	about	Highview,	West Virginia,	and	what	the	impact	of	the	so-called	Fiscal	Responsibility	Act	will	be on	the	people	who	live	there,	and	I	thank	him	for	being	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	finished,	and	the	chairman	spoke	again.	“Thank	you,	sir.	Colonel	Murphy, I’d	like	to	welcome	you	before	the	committee,	and	may	I	say	it	is	an	honor	to have	you	testify	here.	You	have	five	minutes	to	make	your	statement,	and	you are	welcome	to	also	submit	written	testimony.	We	will	then	ask	questions.	Go ahead,	Colonel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	Mr.	Chairman.	First	off,	allow	me	to	begin	by	stating	as	a	matter	of principal	that	I’m	not	happy	being	here.	I’m	not	someone	who	feels	comfortable asking	anyone	for	help,	as	I’m	sure	my	daughter	could	tell	you.	But	all	the	same, I	find	myself	in	an	unthinkable	situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	the	last	twenty	years,	I	worked	with	Saturn	Microsystems	in	Highview, West	Virginia.	I’ve	worked	in	just	about	every	position	in	the	company,	working my	way	up	to	become	one	of	the	two	directors	at	the	plant.	In	that	role,	I	was responsible	for	four	hundred	men	and	women	who	reported	to	me	or	one	of	my managers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Those	men	and	women	are	now	all	out	of	work.	Saturn	decided	to	move	their manufacturing	operations	to	Indonesia.	Never	mind	that	the	plant	and	its operations	were	profitable.	They	weren’t	profitable	enough.	I	read	an	article	in the	Wall	Street	Journal	last	week	indicating	that	Saturn	expects	to	make	an additional	two	hundred	fifty	million	dollars	a	year	from	this	move.	These	profits will	be	on	the	backs	of	eight	hundred	families	who	now	have	nowhere	to	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	story	is	simple.	I	loved	my	wife,	more	than	you	can	imagine.	Three	years ago,	a	drug	addict	from	Charleston	robbed	a	convenience	store	and	murdered Martha.	I	thought	my	life	was	going	to	end	when	that	happened,	but	Martha	and I	had	two	children	who	needed	taking	care	of.	My	daughter	Valerie	is	a	Harvard graduate—something	Martha	and	I	put	our	life	savings	into.	Our	son,	Kenny	Jr., is	six	years	old.	In	the	last	year	he	has	been	in	the	hospital	several	times, averaging	about	twenty	thousand	dollars	a	month	in	medical	bills. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a>“My	family	faces	complete	destitution.	With	our	savings	poured	into	college, and	with	no	medical	insurance,	I	will	be	unable	to	pay	Kenny’s	medical	bills	and he	will…	die.	I	am	seeking	new	work,	with	no	luck	so	far.	That	will	take	some time.	I	have	twenty	years’	experience,	but	the	only	places	left	still	using	my experience	are	all	outside	the	United	States.	In	the	meantime,	Kenny	qualified for	Social	Security	Disability,	which	isn’t	even	enough	money	to	pay	for	his medical	insurance.	The	only	reason	we’re	making	it	at	all	is	my	VA	disability, which,	since	it	is	rated	at	less	than	forty	percent,	I	will	lose	because	of	this	bill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	ask	myself,	is	this	why	I	paid	taxes	all	these	years?	Is	this	why	I	served	in	two wars?	Is	this	what	I	paid	in	blood	for?	What	happened	to	the	seventy	percent	of my	income	that	has	gone	to	taxes	for	the	last	few	years?	None	of	it	will	come back	to	my	family.	Is	this	what	it	was	all	for?	So	my	company	could	take	its	jobs to	Indonesia,	so	you	people	could	deny	my	son	the	medical	care	he	needs	to live?	I	don’t	matter,	Mr.	Chairman,	but	that	boy	is	the	future,	and	if	you	go forward	with	this	proposal	you’ll	abandon	the	future	to	a	horrible	death.	Save	my son.	Save	my	town.	You	can’t	just	cut	off	millions	of	hardworking	Americans from	the	only	safety	net	they	have.	Save	our	future.	Don’t	turn	your	back	on	the children,	whatever	else	you	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Damn! </i>	Karen	disconnected	the	phone	and	stuffed	it	back	in	her	pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy’s	phone	had	switched	over	to	voicemail	after	one	ring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sound	of	the	helicopters	still	shook	the	walls,	but	now	she	heard	a	new sound:	shouting,	then	a	woman	screaming.	The	agents	must	be	in	the	main factory	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	jumped	at	the	sound	of	a	shotgun	blast.	It	was	followed	by	a	dozen	more shots	from	a	higher	pitched	weapon.	Sounded	like	an	M16.	Somewhere downstairs,	a	woman	screamed.  <i class="calibre3">Oh,	Christ. </i>	Someone	had	shot	at	the	feds! </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	noxious	smell	hit	her,	and	tear	gas	drifted	in	through	the	open	door.	Karen ducked	down	to	look	for	shelter,	a	place	to	hide.	Behind	the	desk.	She	moved that	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Too	late.	The	door	burst	open,	and	a	young	man	armored	in	a	black	flak	vest	and riot	gear	charged	in,	rifle	aimed	in	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a>“Get	on	the	ground,	get	on	the	ground!	Now,  <i class="calibre3">now!” </i>	She	hesitated	as	another, older	man	charged	in,	this	one	armed	with	a	pistol.	She	recoiled	in	shock.	This was	the	man	she’d	confronted	the	night	before,	Agent	Lawrence	Harris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get	on	the	goddamn	ground,	hands	behind	your	back,”	he	shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	froze.	He	ran	forward,	stuck	the	pistol	against	her	forehead	and	yelled,	“Get on	the	ground!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	grabbed	her	hair	and	yanked	her	to	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fucking	hillbillies,”	the	younger	one	cursed	and	shifted	around	on	both	feet,	too excited	from	the	adrenaline	rush.	“They	shot	Dylan.	I	can’t	believe	they	shot him!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	other	did	not	speak	until	he	hit	her	on	the	side	of	the	head	with	his	fist, raising	stars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	leaned	his	head	down	close	enough	that	she	could	feel	his	lips	against	her right	ear	and	growled,	“What	is	wrong	with	you	people?	I	hope	they	roast	all	of you	in	the	goddamn	electric	chair.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rage	struck,	and	she	arched	her	back	and	pulled	at	the	cuffs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Keep	your	hands	to	yourself,	you	fucking	thug.	You’re	talking	to	an	officer	in the	United	States	Army.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Officer,	huh,”	he	said,	low	in	his	throat.	“Well,	fuck	you,	officer	cop-killing bitch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	saw	stars	again	as	he	hit	her	again	on	the	side	of	the	head.	The	two	of	them dragged	her	out	into	the	hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	heard	a	scream.	“Karen!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	up,	startled	and	still	disoriented,	to	see	Dave	Firkus	charge	at	them, his	face	almost	purple	with	rage,	a	bear	protecting	its	cub. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take	your	hands	off	her.	Let	her	go!  <i class="calibre3">Let	her	go!” </i>	he	shouted	as	he	charged. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a>“Stop,”	shouted	Agent	Harris,	as	the	other	agent	raised	his	rifle.	They	dropped Karen	to	the	floor	with	a	thud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	she	screamed.	“David,	stop!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	young	one	shot	a	burst	from	his	M16.	The	first	bullet	struck	David	square	in the	chest,	the	next	two	though	the	neck.	Blood	spattered	across	the	hallway	and he	fell	to	the	floor.	Blood	from	an	artery	poured	out	onto	the	carpet	and	stained	it black. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">No</i>,	God	damn	it!”	she	screamed.	“You	killed	him!	What	is	wrong	with	you people?  <i class="calibre3">Murderers!” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Harris	shouted.	“Idiot,	put	that	rifle	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	shrieked	again,	struggling.	“Let	me	go!	Bandage	him!  <i class="calibre3">Do</i>	something, goddamn	it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shut	up,	bitch,”	the	young	one	shouted,	still	rocking	back	and	forth	on	his	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	kicked	her	on	the	side	of	the	head.	The	third	hit	on	the	head	in	five	minutes, this	one	knocked	her	out	cold. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	Eight</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">June	8</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	knew	it	was	bad	when	he	saw	his	daughter	hunch	over	and	whisper	into her	phone.	Her	face	twisted	with	shock,	fear	and	grief	all	at	once.	What	could	be wrong?	Murphy’s	heart	thumped	as	he	watched	her	lean	forward	and	whisper	to Clark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark’s	face	went	pale,	and	he	quickly	wrote	a	note	and	passed	it	to	the chairman.	The	chairman	nodded	to	him,	and	Clark	and	Valerie	moved	toward	the exit.	Clark	pointed	to	Murphy	and	crooked	his	finger.	Murphy	stood	and	pushed his	way	through	the	crowd,	which	largely	ignored	him	as	they	listened	to	the final	panel	of	witnesses,	the	first	of	whom	had	been	answering	questions	for twenty	minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside,	Clark	spoke	first.	“Colonel	Murphy,	I’ve	got	some	bad	news.	A	gun battle	of	some	kind	took	place	at	the	Saturn	plant	this	morning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark’s	statement	was	so	far	from	anything	Murphy	had	expected	that	it	took him	a	moment	to	respond. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	many	people	were	hurt?	What	did	you	hear?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	details	yet,	I’m	afraid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	to	go	home,	immediately,”	Murphy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually,	Colonel,	I	suggest	we	all	go	together,	in	your	vehicle.	Valerie	and	I can	rent	a	car	to	come	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	thought	about	it	half	a	second,	and	then	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	that’ll	work.	Let’s	get	rolling.”	He	turned	and	led	the	way	toward	his car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	they	walked,	Valerie	called	instructions	back	to	the	office	to	have	a	rental	car made	available	in	Highview	later	in	the	day.	Murphy	dialed	Karen’s	number.	No</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a>answer	for	six	rings,	then	a	rough	male	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	is	Karen	Greenfield	available?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	Who’s	calling?”	a	man	asked,	tone	brusque. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	Colonel	Murphy,	her	battalion	commander.	Who	are	you,	and	why	do you	have	her	phone?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	heard	the	guy	on	the	other	end	call	out,	“Sir?	It’s	some	person	says	he’s a	Colonel	something-or-other.	Wants	to	talk	to	the	woman	who	had	this	phone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	heard	a	rustling,	and	then	someone	came	on	the	line.	“This	is	Special Agent	Hagarty.	Who’s	speaking?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hagarty,	this	is	Colonel	Ken	Murphy	of	the	West	Virginia	National	Guard.	I need	an	explanation	right	now	for	why	you	have	the	telephone	of	one	of	my company	commanders.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	heard	an	intake	of	breath.	“Colonel,	it’s	funny	to	hear	from	you	again.	In	fact, it	worries	me	to	hear	from	you	again.	I	don’t	know	about	any	company commanders.	This	phone	belongs	to	someone	we	arrested,	who	aided	and abetted	the	murder	of	two	of	my	men.	If	you	know	anything	about	this,	sir,	I suggest	you	come	here	now	to	speak	with	us.	If	you	don’t,	we’ll	want	to	talk	to you	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	be	there	soon	enough.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	hit	the	off	button	and	put	away	the	phone.	Hagarty’s	tone	reminded	him too	much	of	the	Cold	War	movie	portrayals	of	the	KGB. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hagarty,	huh?”	Clark	said,	after	Murphy	relayed	what	he	had	heard.	“Isn’t	he the	guy	who	threatened	you	after	the	bombing?	I	still	haven’t	gotten	a	reply	from DHS	about	the	incident.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	him,	all	right.	They	did	let	Ahmed	and	his	son	go,	about	a	week	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	unlocked	his	truck	and	they	climbed	into	the	vehicle.	He	had	to	move	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>pile	of	books	off	the	front	passenger	seat	in	order	to	make	room	for	the Congressman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	drove	a	little	too	fast	as	they	left	town	via	I-66	and	the	Dulles	Toll	Road toward	Leesburg,	then	north	into	West	Virginia.	Traffic	was	still	light	in	the middle	of	the	day	and	they	made	good	time.	They	dialed	through	the	radio, trying	to	find	news	of	events	in	Highview.	Murphy	tuned	the	radio	to	the	all-news	radio	station	and	they	listened.	Less	than	two	minutes	passed	before	they heard	about	the	plant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Two	federal	agents	were	killed	today	in	a	raid	gone	bad,”	the	radio	announcer said.	“The	Department	of	Homeland	Security	raided	a	closed	computer manufacturing	plant	in	Highview,	West	Virginia,	after	the	plant	was	seized	by	a group	accused	of	being	anti-government	terrorists.	In	the	raid,	two	agents	and five	of	the	suspected	terrorists	were	killed,	and	more	wounded.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	and	Clark	met	each	other’s	eyes.	Seven	people	killed.  <i class="calibre3">Christ. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anti-government	terrorists?	Where	do	they	get	this	crap?”	Valerie	said.	“If	you hadn’t	been	testifying,	you	would	have	been	there,	wouldn’t	you,	Dad?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	didn’t	reply.	He	felt	as	if	someone	had	punched	him	in	the	stomach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	far	worse	than	he	had	imagined.	Five	people	dead?	Was	Karen Greenfield	one	of	them?	She	didn’t	have	her	phone	anymore.	That	fact	alone was	ominous.	Five	so-called	“radicals”	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen	to	this,”	Valerie	said.	She	read	from	her	handheld	computer.	“‘Radicals kill	federal	agents.’	That’s	on	CNN.	The	Washington	Post	says	‘Suspected terrorists	kill	two	agents,	five	civilians.’	Who	wrote	these	articles,	the	DHS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Public	Affairs	office?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	looked	back	at	her.	“I	think	that’s	the	way	it’s	been	for	a	long	time.	The Pentagon	or	DHS	puts	out	a	press	release	and	the	media	just	spits	it	back	out; they	don’t	even	rearrange	the	words	half	the	time.	It’s	like	reading	Pravda	during the	Cold	War.	You	know,	we’re	going	to	have	another	problem.	A	serious	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	that?”	Murphy	responded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	the	DHS	frames	this	as	a	bunch	of	‘anti-government’	activists,	you	can	bet they’ll	prosecute	the	rest	of	the	employees,	maybe	as	accessories	to	murder	or</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>manslaughter	or	something	like	that.	They’ll	move	quick	to	cover	their	asses.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy’s	knuckles	went	white	on	the	steering	wheel.	“What	were	they	thinking? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why	would	you	send	in	the	DHS	with	guns	blazing	before	finding	out	what	the situation	was?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	shook	his	head.	“They’re	covering	themselves.	Except	for	the	Pentagon, the	DHS	is	the	single	biggest	government	agency	and	money-waster,	and	they couldn’t	even	stop	the	bombing	in	Arlington.	Now	they	can	demonstrate	they’ve done	something:	they’ve	stopped	a	cell	of	potential	terrorists.	If	any	DHS	agents were	hurt,	it’ll	make	it	that	much	easier	to	wave	the	flag	and	get	people	to	ignore reality.	On	top	of	that,	Nelson	Barclay	is	one	of	the	big	contributors	to	the President;	they	go	way	back.	You	know	the	Vice	President	used	to	sit	on	Saturn’s Board	didn’t	you?	Nelson	Barclay	has	access	like	you	wouldn’t	believe.	My guess	is	he	asked	the	President	to	make	the	problem	go	away.	The	President delegated	the	whole	issue	to	one	of	his	aides,	and	this	is	the	result.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	didn’t	like	the	way	that	sounded.	“You	really	think	President	Price authorized	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	not	directly,”	Clark	said,	“but	Price	is	owned	by	people	like	Barclay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	drove	in	silence	through	Harpers	Ferry.	After	Harpers	Ferry,	Route	340</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	still	lined	on	both	sides	by	dense,	dark	woods.	Twenty	minutes	later	they pulled	up	to	the	gates	of	the	plant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	crowd	of	reporters	and	news	vans	were	parked	on	the	drive	approaching	the plant,	along	with	fifty	or	more	cars	belonging	to	employees	and	their	family members.	Murphy	carefully	drove	through	and	around	the	crowd	and	pulled	up to	the	gate,	which	was	blocked	by	two	police	cruisers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Paul	Machen,	one	of	the	Sherriff’s	deputies,	stood	in	front	of	his	car.	He approached	as	Murphy	drove	up.	Behind	him,	inside	the	fence,	Murphy	could see	armored	vehicles	and	helicopters	scattered	about	the	parking	lot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sorry,	Colonel,”	he	said	as	Murphy	rolled	down	the	window,	“‘Fraid	I	can’t let	you	any	further.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	leaned	out	and	looked	up	at	him.	“Afternoon,	Paul.	Now	listen,	I’ve	got Congressman	Clark	with	me,	we’re	here	to	see	what	happened	today	and	how</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a>bad	it	was.	What	can	you	tell	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machen	almost	stood	at	attention	when	he	realized	the	Congressman	was	in	the car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,	Mr.	Clark,	I	didn’t	realize	it	you	was	in	there,	I’m	sure	you	can	go	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Feds	told	me	to	keep	everyone	out,	but	I	don’t	suppose	they	meant	you.	Hey Valerie,	it’s	good	to	see	you	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	gave	him	a	weak	smile.	The	two	had	dated	briefly	in	high	school.	It	hadn’t gone	well	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machen	looked	over	his	shoulder,	and	leaned	close	to	the	car.	“It	was	pretty	bad, Colonel.	They	come	storming	up	here	with	tanks	and	helicopters	and	about	a hundred	troopers	come	a-charging	out	and	into	the	plant.	Never	even	a	by-your-leave	to	the	Sheriff,	who	is	mighty	pissed	right	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Deputy	looked	over	his	shoulder	again	and	lowered	his	voice	to	a	stage whisper.	“You	want	my	opinion,	they	was	looking	for	a	fight.	And	they	sure found	it.	Somebody	in	there	had	a	shotgun,	took	out	one	of	the	agents,	and	that started	a	gunfight	right	there	on	the	plant	floor.	Way	I	was	told	it,	people	was screaming	and	jumping	under	tables	and	desks	while	Rob	Bailey	and	Phillip White	shot	it	out	with	the	agents	right	there	on	the	floor.	Course	Bailey	and White	both	got	themselves	blown	away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	closed	his	eyes.	He	couldn’t	help	but	imagine	the	scene,	on	the crowded,	open	factory	floor.	“I	knew	those	boys	would	cause	some	kind	of trouble	one	day,	but	I	never	imagined	this.	Who	else	is	hurt?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why,	fifteen	or	twenty	people	got	shot,	they	had	to	be	taken	to	three	different hospitals.	Mandy	Blankenship’s	dead,	she	got	hit	in	the	crossfire.	And	Dave Firkus.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	gasped.	“Dave!	Oh,	no!	What	happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Way	I	heard	it,	he	charged	two	of	the	agents,	attacked	‘em.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	way,”	Murphy	said.	“I	don’t	believe	it.	Dave	wouldn’t	hurt	a	fly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	this	whole	thing	is	screwy;	it	never	shoulda	happened.	You’ll	want	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a>looking	for	this	Hagarty	fellow,	he	was	over	near	the	helicopters	last	I	saw.	He’s a	little	funny	turned,	if	you	know	what	I	mean.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	drove	into	the	compound,	past	three	parked	armored	vehicles	and	onto	the area	near	the	four	helicopters.	In	the	chaos	of	the	site,	no	one	had	secured	the front	gate.	A	cluster	of	men	stood	near	the	helicopters.	Murphy	parked	near them,	and	the	three	got	out	of	the	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Special	Agent	Hagarty?”	Clark	called	in	a	commanding	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right	here.	I	believe	I	know	Colonel	Murphy.	Who	are	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	recognized	the	man	who	turned	toward	them.	Even	in	his	field	gear,	the balding	Hagarty	had	more	of	the	look	of	an	accountant	than	a	federal	agent.	But the	other	men	gave	him	a	wide	berth	as	he	turned	and	walked	toward	Murphy and	Clark,	shading	his	eyes	against	the	glare	of	the	sun	as	he	walked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	in	charge	of	this…	incident?”	Clark	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am.	This	is	a	crime	scene,	sir.	I’ll	need	you	to	identify	yourselves immediately.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Agent	Hagarty,	I	am	Congressman	Al	Clark.	This	is	my	assistant,	Valerie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’re	here	to	find	out	what	happened	here	today.	I	need	some	explanations	and	I need	them	fast.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty	rolled	his	eyes.	Murphy	glared	at	him,	angry	at	the	outright	disrespect	of Clark’s	congressional	authority. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	you’ll	have	to	talk	to	the	Secretary	to	get	the	details,	I’m	sure	they’ll	be happy	to	make	a	report	to	Congress	when	the	time	comes.	I	can	give	you	a	quick overview.	A	large	group	of	armed	men	took	control	of	this	building	this	morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	sent	here	by	a	known	anti-government	activist,	Dale	Whitt.	Mr.	Whitt is	under	investigation	on	a	variety	of	charges,	including	weapons	violations.	Our people	arrived	on	site	to	assist	the	local	sheriff’s	office,	disperse	the	crowd, secure	private	property	and	to	insure	there	were	no	weapons.	On	our	arrival,	the suspects	opened	fire	on	my	teams,	killing	two	officers	and	wounding	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	secured	the	building	and	we	are	securing	the	crime	scene	now.	And	that,	sir, is	all	I	can	say.	You’ll	need	to	discuss	anything	further	with	the	Secretary.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a>Clark	frowned.	“I	take	it,	then,	your	officers	arrived	in	tanks	and	armed helicopters	in	a	sudden	raid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	I’m	afraid	I	can’t	answer	any	more	questions.	You	need	to	leave	the	area immediately.	As	I	said,	this	is	a	crime	scene,	sir,	and	we	can’t	have	any	non-law enforcement	personnel	on	the	site.	You	might	damage	evidence.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	work	for	the	citizens	of	this	country,	who	I	happen	to	represent.	You	will answer	some	questions.	Where	have	the	wounded	been	taken?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty	put	his	hands	on	his	hips.	“Look,	Congressman.	I’m	don’t	want	to	get	in your	way,	but	I’ve	got	a	job	to	do,	and	it’s	one	I	take	very	seriously.	Our	job	is	to protect	the	American	people,	and	if	you	don’t	like	our	methods	then	I	suggest you	take	it	up	in	Congress.	Here	and	now	is	not	the	time,	sir.	Let	me	make	one thing	very	clear,	however.	The	criminals	inside	that	building	shot	and	killed	two of	my	men.	You	understand	me?	They	fired	on	federal	agents	and	killed	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Think	on	that,	sir.	I’m	afraid	I	won’t	be	able	to	answer	any	more	questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry!	McClain!	Get	over	here!”	He	shouted	the	latter	at	two	agents	still	in	riot gear	and	armed	with	rifles,	and	the	two	ran	up.	“I	want	you	to	escort	these gentlemen	and	this	lady	off	the	site	right	now.	If	they	resist,	place	them	under arrest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	said,	“Agent	Hagarty,	are	you	aware	it	is	a	felony	to	interfere	with	a United	States	Congressman	in	the	commission	of	his	duty?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	you	have	no	duties	here.	I’ll	risk	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Answer	my	goddamn	questions	now,	or	I	will	be	on	the	phone	with	the Secretary	in	about	five	minutes	to	have	you	fired!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty	crossed	his	arms	over	his	chest.	“All	right,	you	get	three	questions	and then	I	want	all	of	you	out	of	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	are	the	wounded?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ve	been	taken	to	a	variety	of	hospitals	in	the	area.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	want	a	list.	Names,	and	the	locations	they	went	to.	Have	it	faxed	to	my	office, by	four	p.m.	today.	Second,	where	are	the	people	you	apprehended?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a>The	demands	and	questions	were	issued	like	bullets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	are	en	route	by	bus	to	Charleston	where	they	will	be	held	until	their arraignment.	That	will	be	handled	in	the	federal	court;	I	don’t	have	any	control over	their	procedures.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Last	question.	Who	authorized	this	operation?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	the	President	of	the	United	States	authorized	it.	Now,	I	am	going	to	ask	you to	leave	one	more	time,	or	I	will	have	you	arrested	for	obstruction	of	justice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	turned	and	walked	away	without	another	word,	and	Murphy	and	Valerie followed	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	glanced	behind	them	as	they	reached	the	car.	Hagarty	had	already turned	aside	and	was	shouting	at	two	of	his	agents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	get	it,	sir,”	he	said	to	Clark.	“How	can	they	think	they’ll	get	away	with this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	might,”	Clark	replied.	“We	don’t	have	a	lot	of	oversight	authority	over DHS.	If	the	President	did	authorize	the	operation,	all	the	machinery	of	our government	will	be	flying	to	back	him	up.	Valerie,	call	the	office.	Let	them	know we’re	headed	to	Charleston,	and	see	about	that	rental	car;	I	don’t	want	to	take any	more	of	your	father’s	valuable	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right	on	it,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	clear	until	morning,	sir,”	Murphy	said.	“I	have	a	sitter	available	overnight; we	didn’t	expect	that	I	would	make	it	back	here	today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	but	I	have	the	feeling	there’s	a	lot	of	very	worried	people	in	Highview today.	Mothers	and	wives	and	husbands	and	children.	Someone	needs	to	talk	to them.	I	think	you’ve	been	been	handed	that	job;	I	would	suggest	you	talk	to	the mayor,	see	if	you	can	get	together	another	town	meeting	right	away.	Let	them know	I	am	working	on	the	release	of	all	those	arrested,	and	we	will	have	status soon	on	the	wounded.	Do	you	mind	taking	that	on?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	a	problem,	sir,”	Murphy	said	as	he	waited	for	an	opening	in	traffic. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a>“Dad,	the	rental	car	was	dropped	off	the	house	about	an	hour	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	took	a	left	turn,	and	headed	toward	his	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">As	people	streamed	into	the	high	school	gym,	Murphy	spoke	to	those	he	knew, many	of	them	wives	and	husbands	of	employees	at	the	plant.	Murphy	was surprised	to	see	Vince	Elkins.	A	family	practitioner	in	Highview,	he	had	referred Kenny	to	the	specialists	when	the	boy’s	symptoms	began	to	crop	up.	On	the occasional	weekend	and	summer	training,	he	served	as	executive	officer	of Murphy’s	battalion.	Elkins	was	anything	but	political,	and	typically	didn’t	get involved	in	the	town’s	public	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	me	the	Russians	didn’t	take	over	while	I	had	my	back	turned?”	Elkins	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	feds	are	out	there	taking	pictures	of	everybody	who	comes	in	the	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	the	hell	is	going	on	up	there,	Ken?	Were	you	there	when	it	happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	shook	his	head.	“I’ll	be	talking	in	just	a	minute,	Vince.	It’s	been	pretty crazy,	today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	say	so.	All	afternoon	I	had	a	stream	of	people	in	the	office,	hysterical, suffering	from	anxiety	and	ulcers	and	God	all	knows	what.	The	whole	town	is wild	with	rumors.	Next	time	the	feds	come	in	to	round	up	half	the	damn	town, they	should	round	up	everyone.	That	way	families	can	stay	together.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	looked	around	the	room.	The	families	of	the	arrested	employees	were here,	as	expected,	crowding	the	room.	A	large	number	of	others	were	here	as well:	folks	from	town,	what	looked	like	the	entire	Chamber	of	Commerce,	and two	or	three	members	of	the	clergy.	Only	twenty-four	hours	had	passed	since	the last	town	meeting,	when	the	employees	decided	to	take	the	plant	back.	What	a difference	twenty-four	hours	made.	Murphy	looked	around	the	room	at	the	angry and	frightened	townspeople,	and	knew	something	fundamental	had	changed	here today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Mayor,	George	Machen,	walked	to	the	front	of	the	room	and	stood	in	front of	the	crowd.	He	bore	a	strong	resemblance	to	his	son:	stocky,	thin	hair,	even	the swagger	that	had	so	turned	off	Valerie	in	high	school.	He	walked	to	the	podium and	held	his	hands	out.	The	audience	quickly	quieted	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a>Machen	spoke,	not	quite	projecting	to	the	back	of	the	room.	Just	quiet	enough that	most	of	the	crowd	leaned	forward	and	listened	close	in	order	to	hear	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	folks.	I	think	everyone	knows	we	had	us	a	bit	of	a	disaster	today.	I’ve got	Colonel	Ken	Murphy	here;	he	was	out	at	the	plant	this	afternoon	with Congressman	Clark.	He’s	going	to	tell	us	what	he	can.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Mayor	Machen	spoke,	half	a	dozen	cameramen	lit	up	the	bright	lights	of	their video	cameras.	Murphy	felt	lead	in	his	stomach	as	he	walked	to	the	podium. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	spoke	quietly,	describing	what	they	had	seen	this	afternoon:	the	helicopters, and	the	executor	of	the	operations,	Special	Agent	Hagarty.	As	he	finished,	a dozen	people	stood	to	ask	questions.	Murphy	pointed	to	the	first,	Amy Hillerman.	Amy’s	husband	was	an	employee	at	the	plant;	the	couple	had	two small	children. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Colonel	Murphy,	do	you	have	names—do	you	know	exactly	who	was	killed	up there,	who	was	arrested?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	shook	his	head.	“Not	yet.	Representative	Clark’s	office	is	compiling	a list,	ma’am.	I	think	it’d	be	most	appropriate	to	let	the	families	of	the	dead	be notified	privately,	don’t	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	overweight	woman	in	a	faded	dress	stood	up.	Murphy	recognized	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shannon	Firkus,	Dave	Firkus’	mother.	She	used	to	come	up	to	the	office	and have	lunch	with	Dave	every	Thursday.	Her	eyes	were	red-rimmed	with	grief, dark	circles	under	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Murphy,	I	already	know	they	done	killed	my	boy.	What	I	want	to	know	is what	are	we	going	to	do	about	it?	We	can’t	let	these	deaths	go	in	vain.	They	was working	for	our	survival!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machen	approached	the	microphone	again,	Murphy	stepping	into	the background.	His	part	was	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ma’am,”	Machen	said,	“I	can’t	tell	you	how	sorry	I	am	about	your	loss,	but what	exactly	are	you	suggesting?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	shout	came	from	the	back	of	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a>“She’s	suggesting	we	go	back	up	there	tomorrow!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	turned	and	looked.	It	was	Dale	Whitt.	Not	an	employee	at	Saturn,	he had	not	been	among	those	arrested,	though	his	voice	has	been	loudest	among those	calling	for	action	the	night	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cameramen	hustled	to	get	a	good	shot	of	him	speaking.	“Mr.	Mayor,	with	all due	respect,	all	the	congressional	inquiries	and	lawyers	in	the	world	won’t	put food	on	the	tables	of	the	families	of	Highview.	Nothing	but	getting	our	families back	to	work	will	do	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stood	to	the	side	and	spoke	to	the	crowd.	“Folks,	a	hundred	years	ago	Old Mother	Jones	was	arrested	for	reading	the	Declaration	of	Independence	out	loud, right	here	in	West	Virginia.	Today,	the	Federal	Government	spent	your	tax	dollar to	send	in	soldiers	to	shoot	at	your	loved	ones.	Think	about	it,	folks.	You	pay sixty	or	seventy	percent	of	your	family	income	to	the	government,	and	for	what? </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	you	can	subsidize	the	companies	that	are	screwing	you	over?	So	you	can subsidize	rich	playboys	like	Nelson	Barclay?	He	doesn’t	pay	one	red	cent	in taxes,	but	he	can	call	in	his	government	thugs	and	goons	to	beat	up	and	shoot	our families	for	trying	to	work	for	a	living!	Thugs	and	goons	we	paid	for	with	our tax	dollars.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	watched	and	wondered	where	this	was	leading.	As	uncomfortable	as	he was	to	realize	it,	Whitt	had	a	point.	Murphy	vividly	recalled	reading	an	article not	two	months	ago	about	the	sweetheart	tax	deals	corporate	executives	were making.	Barclay	had	been	one	of	those	profiled.	The	reporters	looked	excited	as they	jockeyed	their	cameras	around	to	Whitt.	This	was	turning	out	to	be	a	much more	interesting	story	than	they	had	expected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Mayor	spoke	into	the	microphone,	“All	right,	folks,	this	isn’t	getting	us anywhere.	Thank	you	for	having	your	say,	Mr.	Whitt,	but	we	need	to	move—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shut	up,	damn	politician!”	someone	shouted.	Machen	stepped	back	in	shock	at the	blatant	discourtesy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	the	man	speak,”	said	one	of	the	men	at	the	back	of	the	hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	Dale	have	his	say,”	called	another	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machen’s	face	went	pale	at	the	strong	response.	He	motioned	at	Whitt	to	come</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a>to	the	podium.	Whitt	walked	to	the	front	of	the	room	and	stood	next	to	the Mayor	in	front	of	the	podium	and	spoke	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Folks,	I	only	see	one	clear	path	ahead	of	us.	Only	one	path	that	will	do	honor	to David	Firkus,	who	gave	his	life	on	your	behalf.	Only	one	path	that	includes honor	and	dignity.	Tomorrow,	all	the	citizens	of	Highview	must	march	to	the Saturn	plant	and	take	possession	of	it.	Every	last	one	of	us.	Because	it	does	not belong	to	some	rich	son	of	a	bitch	who	cares	more	about	Jakarta	than	he	does about	West	Virginia.	It	belongs	to	us,	to	our	town,	and	to	our	people,	who	built it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	crowd	erupted	in	loud	applause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	turned	to	Murphy,	a	gamble	in	his	eyes.	“What	say	you,	Colonel	Murphy? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tell	us	what	you	think.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stepped	away	from	the	microphone.  <i class="calibre3">A	gamble, </i>	Murphy	thought.	A	very	smart gamble.	Whitt	knew	Murphy	tended	to	be	very	conservative,	and	had	a	great deal	of	influence	in	the	town.	Murphy	walked	forward,	very	conscious	of	the uniform	he	wore.	Damn	it,	if	there	was	ever	a	time	to	speak	up,	this	was	it.	He would	just	have	to	live	with	the	consequences.	He	leaned	into	the	microphone and	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	morning	I	testified	in	front	of	a	congressional	committee	that	was	deciding whether	to	take	away	the	medical	benefits	my	son	needs	to	live.	Folks,	all	it	took was	the	greed	of	one	man	to	destroy	our	economic	life.	You	understand	what	I’m saying?	One	very	powerful,	very	rich	man	makes	a	decision	for	his	benefit,	and the	lives	of	everyone	in	this	town	are	twisted	out	of	control.	I’m	sorry,	folks,	this isn’t	the	America	I	fought	for	in	two	wars.	This	isn’t	the	America	I	swore	to defend.	It’s	not	right.	Some	might	disagree	with	what	I	say,	but…	I	believe	we don’t	have	any	choice.	We	 <i class="calibre3">must</i>	go	back	to	the	plant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	away	from	the	microphone,	a	sinking	feeling	in	his	stomach,	knowing he	had	just	crashed	a	torpedo	into	whatever	was	left	of	his	military	career.  <i class="calibre3">Screw</i> <i class="calibre3">it. </i>	He	was	close	to	retirement	anyway—not	that	his	retirement	from	the	Guard would	amount	to	much.	There	was	a	hushed	silence	after	he	spoke.	Then	the crowd	burst	into	applause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machen	shook	his	head.	Murphy	met	his	eyes,	but	the	Mayor	looked	away, contempt	on	his	face.	Murphy	grimaced.	He	and	Machen	had	been	friends	for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a>twenty	years.	But	Murphy	had	to	tell	it	the	way	he	saw	it.	To	shoot	and	kill someone	like	Dave	Firkus	and	call	him	an	anti-government	activist	was ludicrous—and	criminal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	gathering	broke	up	soon	afterward,	with	most	agreeing	to	meet	in	the	high school	parking	lot	at	six	the	next	morning.	Murphy	wondered	how	many	would show	up—and	whether	or	not	Dale	Whitt	would	be	among	them.	He	pushed	his way	out	at	the	end	of	the	meeting,	threaded	his	way	between	the	cameras	and refused	to	answer	any	of	the	reporters’	questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	time	to	go.	He’d	pick	up	Kenny;	they	could	have	a	quiet	dinner,	and	get the	boy	to	bed	in	his	own	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	old	grandfather	clock	Martha	bought	at	the	antique	fair	in	Winchester	was ticking,	and	Murphy	knew	he	needed	to	get	to	sleep.	Tomorrow	was	going	to	be a	long	day.	All	the	same,	he	sat	there,	holding	a	picture	frame	four	years	old.	In	it was	a	picture	of	Martha	and	Kenny,	the	last	one	he	had	of	them	together.	They sat	side	by	side	on	the	bench	in	the	back	yard,	each	holding	an	apple.	She	had	a subdued	smile	on	her	face	as	she	looked	at	the	camera,	and	Kenny	a	wide	grin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	started	when	the	phone	rang,	glanced	up	at	the	clock.	Quarter	to	eleven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	reached	over	and	grabbed	the	phone,	then	set	the	photograph	on	the	coffee table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	bro,	I	saw	you	on	the	TV	tonight.”	It	was	his	younger	brother	Tom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	smiled,	“Tom,	how	you	doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	all	right,	Ken.	I	was	a	little	worried	about	you.	You	want	to	tell	me	what’s going	on?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom	Murphy	was	thirty-five,	and	had	followed	his	brother	into	the	military,	but unlike	Murphy,	Tom	had	stayed	Regular	Army,	and	was	now	a	colonel,	a	brigade commander	down	at	Fort	Campbell,	Kentucky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tom,	you	wouldn’t	believe	it.	These	folks	were	making	what	amounted	to	a political	protest,	going	back	into	our	old	factory,	and	the	DHS	attacked	them—</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>they	had	Bradleys	out	there,	and	helicopters.	It	was	crazy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	news	says	they	were	armed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	it	turns	out	a	couple	of	hotheads	were.	But	it	wasn’t	what	the	news	said, anti-government	activities,	or	suspected	terrorists,	or	whatever	the	hell	they	were saying.	It	was	nothing	more	than	the	employees	of	the	plant.	Had	I	not	been testifying	in	Washington	this	morning,	I	would	have	been	there,	Tom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“News	says	you’re	going	back	tomorrow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	right.	The	whole	town	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom	didn’t	reply	right	away.	Then	he	said,	“You	might	want	to	think	about	that	a little	harder,	Ken.	Folks	are	pretty	pissed	in	the	DHS.	And	not	just	there.	They put	us	on	alert,	Ken.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	frowned.	“I’ll	tell	you	what,	Tom,	there’s	something	seriously	wrong	if an	air	assault	brigade	is	being	put	on	alert	because	of	a	labor	dispute.	You	ever think	of	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	other	end	of	the	line,	Tom	sighed.	“You’re	right,	Ken.	You	are	right.	I	just worry	about	you,	you	know.	You	haven’t	been	yourself…	well,	in	a	long	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	take	care	of	yourself,	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom	might	as	well	have	shouted	the	unsaid	words:	 <i class="calibre3">you	haven’t	been	the	same</i> <i class="calibre3">since	Martha	died. </i>	What	the	hell	did	he	expect?	Everyone	seemed	to	think	he was	just	going	to	pick	up	again,	as	if	she’d	never	been	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">None	of	the	anger	came	through	in	his	voice.	“I	will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	are	Kenny	and	Valerie?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Valerie’s	doing	well.	You	should	see	her	at	work,	Tom.	Looks	like	she’s	running the	whole	show	up	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,	good.	And	Kenny?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	shifted	his	position,	glanced	down	the	hall	to	Kenny’s	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a>“Well—you	know,	Tom.	Kenny’s	doing	the	best	he	can.	I	don’t	know	how	much time	we	have.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom	let	out	a	sigh.	“I	know.	Take	care	of	yourself,	Ken,	and	be	careful.	I	don’t want	to	be	seeing	you	on	the	evening	news	again,	all	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	got	it,	Tom.	Love	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	too,	bro.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	hung	up	the	phone,	looked	at	the	photograph	again,	and	closed	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	Nine</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">June	9</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Murphy	awoke	and	rolled	out	of	bed	early	the	next	morning,	the unseasonable	chill	startled	him.	His	breath	appeared	in	a	mist,	and	he	hurried	to dress	in	stout	jeans	and	heavy	flannel	shirt.	Half	a	dozen	old,	ignored	pieces	of wood	lay	in	the	steel	basket	next	to	the	cast-iron	wood	stove	in	the	living	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	hadn’t	used	it	in	almost	two	months.	He	hurried	to	get	a	fire	going. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	leg	ached	below	the	knee;	where	by	rights	he	shouldn’t	feel	anything	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wasn’t	usually	bothered	by	phantom	pain,	but	sometimes,	when	it	was	cold, it	was	bad	enough	to	wake	him	up	in	the	middle	of	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	he	had	the	fire	going,	he	had	his	coffee	alone	at	the	kitchen	table,	and stared	out	the	window	into	the	darkness.	As	usual,	he	thought	of	Martha.	Once,	it would	have	been	the	two	of	them	drinking	coffee	together	before	the	kids	woke up	and	the	day	started.	Not	long	ago,	Valerie	suggested	the	time	had	come	for him	to	think	about	moving	on.	As	if	he	knew	how	to	do	that.	How	could	he move	on	when	all	it	took	to	see	her	was	closing	his	eyes?	Or	looking	at	Valerie, who	looked	so	much	like	her	mother	it	was	breathtaking? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes	it	seemed	only	yesterday	the	Sheriff	called	and	told	him.	When	he thought	of	her	on	the	floor	of	the	convenience	store,	her	lifeblood	pouring	out	as the	son	of	a	bitch	stepped	over	her	to	take	a	pathetic	sum	of	cash	out	of	the register,	his	fingernails	bit	into	his	palms.	When	he	thought	of	her	dying	alone, he	wanted	to	howl. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">We	were	supposed	to	grow	old	together, </i>	he	thought.  <i class="calibre3">Now	I’ve	grown	old	without</i> <i class="calibre3">you. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">A	car	approached	outside,	tires	crunching	on	the	gravel	driveway,	slowed	down, and	the	newspaper	thumped	against	the	side	of	the	house.	He	stepped	out	into the	cold	and	brought	it	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	center	of	the	page	above	the	fold	displayed	a	color	photograph	of	him	in front	of	the	podium	the	night	before.	The	lurid	headline	said,	“DHS	Raids Computer	Plant,	Seven	Killed.”	The	caption	under	the	photograph	read, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a>“Lieutenant	Colonel	Ken	Murphy	of	Highview	speaks	to	demonstrators.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	scanned	the	article,	and	then	wished	he	hadn’t.	Filled	with	inaccuracies, it	portrayed	the	people	of	Highview	as	a	group	of	anti-government	ideologues, lumping	them	in	with	white	supremacists	and	the	militia	movement.	But	these folks	weren’t	political	at	all—or,	more	accurately,	they	fell	all	over	the	political spectrum.	He’d	spent	much	of	night	after	the	town	meeting,	on	the	phone	with Valerie	and	the	Mayor,	trying	to	determine	the	whereabouts	of	the	employees who’d	been	injured	or	arrested.	The	injured	were	all	accounted	for	now—and	the dead.	Those	arrested	had	been	bussed	the	several	hour	drive	to	the	Charleston federal	lockup—among	them,	Karen	Greenfield.	God	only	knew	what	he	was going	to	do	about	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	finished	his	coffee,	rinsed	the	cup	and	put	it	in	the	sink,	then	laced	up his	work	boots.	He	woke	Kenny	and	got	him	ready	to	go,	and	then	they	drove into	town.	On	the	way	to	the	town	square,	he	passed	the	high	school.	Cars already	filled	half	the	lot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lights	were	on	downstairs	at	the	Al-Khoury	grocery,	but	the	doorknob wouldn’t	turn.	It	was	still	two	hours	before	opening	time.	Murphy	rang	the	bell and	Samira	answered	the	door.	She	was	a	petite	girl	and	a	stunning	beauty,	with luxurious	black	hair,	pale	brown	skin	and	green	eyes.	In	high	school	she’d	been	a solid	student,	but	just	missed	being	part	of	the	popular	crowd	because	her	family didn’t	have	a	lot	of	money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled	when	she	saw	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	Kenny,	how’s	it	going?”	She	ruffled	the	boy’s	hair.	Sleepy,	he	hugged	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ken.”	Ahmed	bounded	down	the	stairs.	“I	wanted	to	say	thank	you,	my	friend.	I think	the	calls	from	Congressman	Clark	helped	free	me	and	Hayder	so	quickly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	glad.	Are	you	okay?	Any	problems	in	town	since	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ahmed	and	his	daughter	met	each	other’s	eyes,	then	looked	back	at	Murphy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	good	as	can	be	expected.	You	know	how	it	is—every	time	something	bad happens	anywhere,	it	is	the	fault	of	an	Arab.	This	is	how	some	people	think.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Samira	spoke	to	the	boy,	breaking	the	awkward	moment.	“Hey	Kenny,	why</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>don’t	you	come	on	up	with	me?	Want	some	breakfast?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah!”	Kenny	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	held	out	a	stuffed	backpack.	“Here’s	his	bag.	The	autoinjector	is	in there,	along	with	an	extra	change	of	clothes.	Thank	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	led	Kenny	upstairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	turned	back	to	Ahmed,	reached	in	his	pocket	and	handed	him	an envelope	with	writing	on	the	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen,	if	anything	happens	to	me	today,	this	is	my	parents’	number.	They	know there	might	be	a	problem.	If	need	be,	call	them	and	put	Kenny	on	a	plane	down to	Georgia.	There’s	enough	money	for	a	ticket	in	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	said	goodbye,	and	Murphy	backed	out	the	door.	He	got	back	into	his	truck and	drove	over	to	the	high	school.	The	sky	was	an	unforgiving	grey	above	the trees.	He	hoped	it	wouldn’t	rain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Forty-five	minutes	later,	Murphy	saw	that	most	of	the	town	had	gathered	in	front of	the	high	school,	including,	to	his	surprise,	Mayor	George	Machen	and	Dale Whitt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	didn’t	hem	and	haw.	“I’m	kind	of	surprised	to	see	you	up	here,	George.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machen	grimaced.	“I	am,	too.	I	don’t	approve,	but	the	whole	dang	town	is	out.	I won’t	sit	on	the	sidelines	while	women	and	children	are	out	here	fighting	for their	livelihood.	If	we	all	go	down,	we	all	go	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	line	of	about	two	hundred	cars	stretched	down	the	street.	The	television	vans were	back,	and	bright	lights	shone	in	the	semi-darkness	as	the	cameramen	filmed the	gathering.	A	group	of	reporters	started	to	approach	the	three	who	had,	by virtue	of	speaking	the	night	before,	become	the	leaders	of	this	gathering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks	like	it’s	time	for	us	to	get	rolling,”	Murphy	said,	watching	the	reporters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	not	run	off	just	yet,”	Whitt	said.	“The	press	may	be	annoying,	but	they can	also	be	our	best	allies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>“Or	our	worst	enemies,”	Murphy	said.	“Won’t	take	much	to	make	the	media	turn on	us.	You	read	the	Gazette	this	morning?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	did,”	Whitt	replied.	“The	media	will	get	it	wrong,	but	the	more	you	talk,	the more	chances	they	have	to	get	it	right.	Besides,	unlike	yesterday	at	the	plant,	the media	is	here.	I	asked	around—Barclay	apparently	called	in	a	bunch	of	favors, told	the	networks	there	was	no	story	in	Highview.	Given	what	happened,	I expect	he’s	burned	some	bridges—the	reporters	aren’t	happy	they	weren’t	here when	things	went	south	yesterday.	It	will	be	harder	to	distort	what	they	see	with their	own	eyes;	they	won’t	repeat	what	the	DHS	tells	them	if	their	own	cameras show	something	different.	It’s	not	all	about	politics—this	is	beyond	politics.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	glanced	sidelong	at	Whitt.	From	what	he’d	seen	of	Whitt,	everything centered	on	politics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	reporters	immediately	began	asking	questions,	which	were	quickly dispensed	with.	But	Murphy	gained	one	valuable	piece	of	intelligence	from them:	the	armored	vehicles	were	now	brazenly	parked	at	the	front	gate	of	the plant.	He	didn’t	know	whether	to	take	the	implied	threat	seriously	or	not.	Were these	people	idiotic	enough	to	attack	unarmed	townspeople	with	armored vehicles?	On	television,	no	less?	Before	yesterday,	he	wouldn’t	have	thought	it possible.	He	shrugged	and	got	behind	the	wheel.	He	would	find	out	soon enough.	He	drove	out	of	the	parking	lot	slowly,	a	long	line	of	vehicles	forming up	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	the	high	school	it	took	about	five	minutes	to	reach	the	closed,	locked	gates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	pulled	to	the	side	of	the	road	and	parked.	Behind	the	gates	were	two Bradley	fighting	vehicles.	The	turrets	were	turned	backward,	with	the	main	gun away	from	the	crowd.	At	least	they	had	that	much	sense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Four	agents	from	the	DHS	stood	behind	the	gate	in	full	combat	gear,	carrying rifles	with	grenade	launchers	slung	under	the	barrels.	A	fifth	stood	to	the	side, digital	camera	in	hand	with	a	telescopic	lens.	He	began	shooting	photographs	of the	townspeople	as	soon	as	they	parked.	Murphy	ignored	them,	his	face impassive.	He	stepped	out	of	the	truck,	walked	around	the	back	where	the	agents couldn’t	see	him,	and	lifted	an	old	pair	of	bolt	cutters	he’d	thrown	into	it	the night	before.	The	officers	appeared	to	become	very	agitated	when	he	appeared again,	bolt	cutters	in	hand.	One	spoke	into	a	cell	phone	while	the	others	backed away	from	the	gate,	toward	the	armored	vehicles. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>Behind	Murphy,	a	crowd	gathered	as	townspeople	parked	in	a	line	behind	his and	got	out	of	their	cars.	The	mayor	and	Whitt	both	approached	him.	At	least two	or	three	hundred	others	approached	as	well.	Three	television	vans	had parked	to	the	side	of	the	two-lane	road,	with	cameras	mounted	on	tripods.	A reporter	stood	in	front	of	the	CNN	van,	making	what	appeared	to	be	a	live report.	Two	more	reporters	crouched	down	close	to	Murphy,	filming	him	and	the others	as	they	made	their	approach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sing.	The	National	Anthem.”	Whitt	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	 <i class="calibre3">what?” </i>	Machen	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	going	to	start	singing	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayor	Machen	looked	at	Whitt	with	contempt.	“I	don’t	think	that’s	necessary</p>
<p class="calibre1">—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt,	ignoring	the	Mayor,	turned	around	and	walked	backwards	beside	Murphy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Men	and	women	of	Highview,	this	is	our	plant,”	he	shouted.	“This	is	our	town. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Federal	police	stand	on	the	other	side	of	the	gate,	but	they	cannot	stand	against the	people.	They	cannot	take	away	our	rights	as	Americans.	Let	us	now	go forth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	started	singing	the	Star	Spangled	Banner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	crowd	followed	Whitt’s	lead,	slowly	at	first,	then	more	enthusiastically	as they	fell	into	the	rhythm.	Glancing	back,	Murphy	saw	tears	in	the	eyes	of	some of	the	men	as	they	sang.	“…	by	the	dawn’s	early	light….” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	approached	the	gate	with	the	bolt	cutters	as	the	men	and	women	behind him	sang.	“…What	so	proudly	we	hailed…	at	the	twilight’s	last	gleaming.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,”	called	one	of	the	black-uniformed	agents,	“if	you	do	that	I	will	have	to place	you	under	arrest.	Please	put	down	the	bolt	cutters	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	ignored	him.	The	cameramen	jockeyed	for	position	against	the	fence, trying	to	get	the	best	shot	as	Murphy	positioned	the	bolt	cutters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Careful,”	he	said,	glancing	at	the	closest	cameraman.	“You	don’t	want	to	get	a fragment	of	this	in	your	eyes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a>He	placed	the	lock	between	the	blades	and	squeezed.	It	didn’t	break,	so	he squeezed	harder,	veins	popping	out	on	his	forehead.	The	padlock	snapped	with	a loud	crack,	then	clattered	onto	the	pavement.	Murphy	pulled	the	chain	loose	and threw	it	to	the	side,	then	opened	the	gates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	townspeople	continued	to	sing.	“And	the	rocket’s	red	glare…	the	bombs bursting	in	air…	gave	proof	through	the	night…	that	our	flag	was	still	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	singing	sent	chills	down	Murphy’s	spine.	He	walked	forward.	The	federal officers	backed	away	and	put	on	gas	masks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh,	no.	He’d	been	through	the	gas	chamber	three	times	in	his	military	career. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riot	gas	made	you	choke	and	puke	and	gag,	made	your	eyes	hurt	like	hell.	They wouldn’t	be	singing	much	longer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	walked	forward	anyway,	with	the	town	behind	him.	“Oh	say	does	that	Star Spangled	Banner	yet	wave….” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	feds	fired	three,	then	four	gas	grenades	with	a	low-pitched	pop.	The grenades	landed	amidst	the	feet	of	the	townspeople.	Smoke	started	to	billow	up and	someone	screamed.	The	singing	abruptly	stopped.	The	newsmen	rushed	to the	side	with	their	cameras	and	continued	to	film. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	threw	a	gas	grenade	back	at	the	feds.	It	came	down	behind	the	line	of riot	troops	who	marched	forward,	carrying	plastic	shields	and	batons.	They moved	in	a	phalanx	and	shoved	the	crowd	back.	Another	scream,	as	a	fed	hit someone	on	the	head	with	a	baton.	They	fired	four	more	grenades	into	the crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	agent	stood	right	in	front	of	Murphy	now.	Murphy	looked	at	the	man’s	face behind	the	plastic	visor	and	saw	fear.	The	agent	slammed	his	shield	into	Murphy, then	reached	out	and	cracked	him	over	the	head	with	the	baton.	Murphy’s prosthetic	leg	slipped	out	from	under	him,	and	he	fell	back	to	the	ground	with	a grunt.	He	felt	blood	in	his	hair	and	on	the	side	of	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Disperse	and	return	to	your	homes,”	someone	called	over	a	megaphone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Disperse	and	return	to	your	homes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many	in	the	crowd	were	running	away	now,	and	the	line	of	troops	had	forced most	of	the	people	outside	the	gate.	Murphy	looked	up,	saw	David	Firkus’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a>mother.	She	lay	on	her	side,	her	face	bright	red,	mouth	open.	The	tear	gas	rolled over	her	in	a	great	cloud.	Murphy	crawled	toward	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get	out	of	here,”	one	of	the	agents	yelled.	Murphy	felt	a	kick	in	his	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	stood	and	pointed	at	Shannon	Firkus.	“She	needs	help.”	Then	he doubled	over	and	vomited.	Tears	ran	down	his	face	from	the	concentrated smoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vince	Elkins	had	showed	up	at	her	side	just	as	Murphy	had.	Mucus	and	tears poured	from	his	face	as	he	took	her	pulse,	then	cursed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“God	damn	it,”	he	shouted	at	Murphy.	“She’s	got	no	pulse.	She’s	had	a	heart attack.	I	told	her	not	to	come	out	here	today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	felt	the	crack	of	a	baton	against	his	back	and	stumbled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	a	doctor,”	shouted	Elkins.	“This	woman	needs—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	black-clad	riot	policeman	silenced	him	momentarily,	cracking	a	baton	over his	head.	The	two	agents	shoved	Murphy	and	Elkins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	woman	needs	help!”	Elkins	screamed	in	the	face	of	one	of	the	agents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blood	ran	down	the	side	of	his	face.	He	pointed	at	Shannon	Firkus,	who	still	lay on	the	ground.	This	time,	the	officer	listened,	dropping	to	his	knees	beside	the woman,	but	it	was	too	late.	Shannon	Firkus,	like	her	son	the	day	before	her,	lay dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	Ten</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">June	17</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A	week	after	the	events	at	the	plant,	Murphy	was	still	reeling	in	shock.	Somehow he’d	never	expected	the	violent	response,	the	ready	deployment	of	paramilitary forces.	He	moved	through	his	days,	mailing	resumes,	filling	out	job	applications, playing	with	his	son,	feeling	something	akin	to	grief.	He’d	spent	his	life	in	the military.	He	never	thought	he’d	see	its	agents	used	against	their	own	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	town	was	as	quiet	as	a	funeral.	The	plant	employees	had	been	released,	but the	streets	were	still	hushed,	some	businesses	closed.	Nine	people	had	died	by violence	in	two	days,	unheard	of	in	a	town	only	a	few	thousand	people.	Murphy and	others	from	the	town	had	driven	a	convoy	to	Charleston	to	bring	back	the workers	who’d	been	arrested;	they	returned	with	horror	stories	of	being	crowded into	both	the	county	jail	and	the	federal	lockup,	packed	in	ten	to	a	cell	with	drug dealers	and	murderers.	Everywhere	he	looked,	smoldering	rage	was	just	under the	surface.	He’d	never	seen	Karen	Greenfield	so	angry—during	the	drive	back she’d	described	the	cell,	with	twenty	women	packed	into	a	ten	by	ten	room	with nowhere	to	sit.	One	of	the	women,	a	junkie,	had	gone	into	convulsions,	but	it still	took	twenty	minutes	to	get	the	attention	of	the	guards	to	get	her	medical care. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	rest	of	the	country,	by	contrast,	seemed	to	have	gone	off	the	deep	end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stories	about	anti-government	movements	and	militias	flooded	the	media, focusing	on	the	Sons	of	Liberty	in	Baughman	Settlement,	thirty	of	whom	had been	detained	by	the	DHS	during	their	raid	the	previous	week.	A	tremendous amount	of	coverage	was	also	devoted	to	Oklahoma	City	and	the	bombing	twenty years	before.	Now	that	the	federal	government	had	squarely	pointed	the	finger	at a	domestic	group,	the	previous	weeks’	violence	and	suspicion	against	Middle Easterners	passed	from	the	consciousness	of	the	nation,	or	at	least	of	the	national media.	Reporters	crowded	Highview:	satellite	vans	still	sat	beside	the	town square,	and	Murphy’s	home	phone	rang	off	the	hook	for	three	days	after	the town	had	tried	to	take	the	plant.	He’d	finally	unplugged	it.	Valerie	had	his mobile	phone	number	if	she	needed	to	reach	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	DHS	and	their	armored	vehicles	still	occupied	the	plant.	It	was	an	uneasy</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a>standoff,	and	small	groups	of	townspeople,	by	ones	and	twos,	made	their	way	to the	entrance	of	the	plant	and	put	flowers	next	to	the	gate,	in	a	makeshift memorial	to	Dave	and	Shannon	Firkus,	Mandy	Blankenship,	and	the	others	who had	died	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy’s	somnolence	came	to	an	abrupt	end	one	afternoon	a	week	after	the violence	at	the	plant,	with	a	phone	call	from	Dale	Whitt,	who	insisted	on meeting	in	person.	The	next	day,	Murphy	arrived	at	Sally’s	Diner	at	noon, irritated	that	the	noxious	smell	of	tear	gas	still	permeated	his	car.	At	least	he wasn’t	planning	on	reselling	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Murphy	arrived,	Whitt	was	already	there,	sitting	at	a	table	in	the	back, hands	cradling	an	oversized	mug.	The	room	was	not	well	illuminated,	but	it	was clean	and	not	too	crowded	today.	Folks	were	staying	home	and	saving	money, and	all	the	local	businesses	were	feeling	the	pinch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	sat	across	from	Whitt.	In	the	last	few	days,	Whitt	had	gained	celebrity status	in	Highview.	Murphy	had	seen	it	in	the	way	people	talked	about	him,	in far	more	respectful	terms	than	they	spoke	of	the	Mayor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ken.	I	appreciate	you	coming.”	Whitt	smiled	as	he	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,	Dale.	You	were	awful	mysterious	on	the	phone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	took	a	sip	from	his	steaming	mug,	and	then	replied.	“You’ll	understand why	soon	enough,	but	I’d	like	to	discuss	it	all	together.	Can	we	wait	until	the Mayor	arrives?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	talked	of	other	things	for	a	few	minutes:	mostly	bad	news,	businesses	that had	closed	in	the	county,	the	string	of	funerals,	and	the	suspicion	they	were drawing	from	the	rest	of	the	country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	Murphy	heard	the	Mayor’s	voice	behind	him.	“Well	if	it	isn’t	Mr.	Whitt and	Colonel	Murphy.	I	didn’t	realize	you	were	involved	in	his	scheming, Colonel.	How	are	you	two	doing	today?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	stood,	as	did	Whitt.	They	shook	hands	all	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Mayor	sat,	looking	at	the	two	of	them	with	frank	curiosity.	The	waitress approached	and	they	ordered	without	looking	at	the	menu. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>“Well,	Dale,”	said	Machen,	“you	was	pretty	hot	to	talk	right	away.	You	want	to clue	me	in?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	sat	back	and	studied	the	two	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Mayor,	Colonel,	I’m	going	to	ask	you	both	to	keep	what	I	have	to	say mum,	understand?	Until	I	can	make	my	announcement	in	public.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	shrugged,	and	the	Mayor	answered.	“Well,	I’d	have	to	know	what	you had	to	say	to	make	a	hard	promise.	But	a	man’s	only	as	good	as	his	word,	so you’ve	got	mine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irrationally	irritated	that	the	Mayor	had	managed	to	give	two	opposite	answers	at once,	Murphy	replied.	“I	don’t	have	any	problem	with	that,	Dale.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	appreciate	that.	Gentlemen,	I’m	here	to	ask	for	your	support.	I	plan	to	run	for the	state	Senate	in	November.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	and	Machen	looked	at	each	other.	The	Mayor	spoke	first.	“Well,	Dale,	I appreciate	you	asking	for	my	support,	but	I	have	to	admit,	your	candidacy…</p>
<p class="calibre1">well,	it	ain’t	earth	shattering.	Old	Man	Davidson	has	been	in	that	seat—God,	I don’t	even	know.	Thirty	years,	at	least.	You	don’t	have	a	chance	against	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	grinned.	“I	know.	My	daddy	lost	an	election	against	him	in	1984.	But	the way	I	see	it,	things	is	different	now.	Davidson	may	be	a	long	term	incumbent, but	he	doesn’t	have	any	passion.	The	voters	vote	for	him	‘cause	there	isn’t anyone	else	on	the	ballot,	or	they	recognize	his	name	or	some	such.	I	plan	to give	them	a	reason	to	vote	for	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	stopped	speaking,	and	there	was	an	uncomfortable	silence	as	the	waitress brought	their	drinks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	she	left,	Machen	asked,	“And	what	would	that	reason	be,	Mr.	Whitt?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gentlemen,	I	plan	to	run	on	a	platform	proposing	that	West	Virginia	secede from	the	United	States.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	silence	after	his	statement	was	long.	If	it	hadn’t	been	for	the	banging	of	pots and	pans	in	the	back	room,	you	might	have	heard	the	wind	whisper	outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	brought	his	water	to	his	lips,	leaned	back	in	his	chair,	and	studied	Whitt</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a>in	a	very	different	light.	That	neither	he	nor	Machen	burst	into	laughter	was	a measure	of	just	how	angry	they—and	the	rest	of	the	town—were. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayor	Machen	was	the	first	to	recover.	When	he	spoke,	his	tone	had	an	edge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	out	of	your	mind?	They’d	tear	you	apart.	This	is	a	very	patriotic	town and	you’re	talking	treason.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	gestured	with	his	hands	as	he	replied.	“You’re	right,	and	you’re	wrong, Mayor.	Folks	are	patriotic.	They’re	patriotic	for	what	they	know—for	their	town, for	their	families,	even	for	West	Virginia.	They	love	America.	But	what	do	they know	of	the	federal	government	of	the	United	States?	Bunch	of	foreign	wars,	no one	was	sure	what	they	were	about?	Peacekeeping	duty	in	some	half-baked	mud puddle	half	way	around	the	world?	Sixty	percent	of	their	money	supposedly	for social	security	spent	on	something	else?	Forcing	them	out	of	the	plant	at gunpoint?	Shooting	our	neighbors	and	friends	and	husbands	and	wives?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machen	turned	red.	“Well,	I	never…	I	ought	to	have	you	arrested,	you	son	of	a bitch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	raised	a	hand,	palm	up.	“Let	him	have	his	say,	George.	You	may	not agree	with	him,	but	he’s	got	a	right	to	speak.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	to	me,	he	don’t.	Get	the	hell	out	of	here,	you	red	son	of	a	bitch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mayor,	don’t	you	even	see	how	disconnected	you	are	from	your	own	people? </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	is	what	the	voters	want.	They’ve	had	enough.	Only	thing	the	federal government	ever	did	in	West	Virginia	was	send	in	the	Army	to	back	up	the	coal company	thugs.	Look	at	this	situation	down	in	Baughman	Settlement—you	ever heard	of	those	folks	down	there,	before	the	feds	said	they	were	behind	the Arlington	bombing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	said,	“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I’ll	tell	you	what,	I	know	those	people,	and	I’ve	been	down	there	to	their compound.”	He	looked	around	and	lowered	his	voice.	“They’re	not	political; they’re	isolationist,	religious	folks.	They’ve	got	their	little	compound	in	the mountains,	and	they	just	want	to	be	left	alone,	understand?	I	tried	to	get	them hooked	up	with	the	Libertarians	down	there	about	two,	three	years	ago,	and	they just	weren’t	interested	in	politics.	Now	why	would	they	go	blow	up	a	bunch	of defense	contractors?	It	doesn’t	make	any	sense.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a>Machen	looked	at	him	with	contempt.	“Next	you’ll	be	saying	the	federal government	bombed	their	own	people,	won’t	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	shrugged.	“I	don’t	know	who	did	it,	Mr.	Mayor.	I	do	know	it	wasn’t	the people	the	DHS	said	did	it.	But	they	sure	were	easy	pickings,	weren’t	they?	Just like	we	were	in	Highview.	Send	in	some	combat	troops	against	unprepared civilians	and	tell	the	public	you’ve	got	yourself	a	bunch	of	terrorists.	Shows they’ve	been	doing	something	about	terrorism,	doesn’t	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machen	stood	up.	“I’m	not	listening	to	another	word	out	of	you.	Not	only	that—</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	ain’t	gonna	run	against	that	old	fool	Davidson.	You’ll	run	against	me.	I’ll	be damned	if	I’ll	have	some	red	traitor	son	of	a	bitch	as	my	senator.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	held	his	hand	palm	out.	“It	doesn’t	have	to	be	this	way,	George.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machen	spat.	“Mr.	Mayor	to	you.	You	coming,	Colonel?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	pursed	his	lips.	“I’ll	hear	him	out,	Mayor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machen’s	eyes	widened.	“For	God’s	sake,	Ken.	You	of	all	people—you	fought	in two	wars	for	this	country!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	I	would	do	so	again.	I	fought	because	I	believe	people	should	have	their say.	I’ll	respect	Dale’s	right	to	have	his.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well	you	can	both	go	to	hell	then,”	Machen	said.	He	turned	and	stalked	out	of the	diner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	hoping	he	wouldn’t	react	like	that,”	Whitt	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	must	be	out	of	your	mind,	Dale,	to	think	you	can	get	elected	on	that platform.	He’s	right,	you	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	responded,	“No,	he’s	not.	Colonel,	think	about	what	you	said	the	other day.	Is	this	what	you	fought	in	two	wars	for?	How	about	having	your	tax	money used	against	you	right	here	in	Highview,	not	halfway	around	the	world	on	some peacekeeping	operation,	enforcing	corporate	policies	for	the	oil	companies,	or subsidizing	sons	of	bitches	like	Nelson	Barclay.	Christ,	Ken,  <i class="calibre3">you</i>	probably	paid more	taxes	than	Richardson	did	last	year.	Not	to	mention	the	Purple	Heart	you earned	protecting	our	oil	supply.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a>Murphy	took	another	drink,	unwilling	to	commit	to	an	opinion.	“I’ll	think	about it,	Dale.	That’s	all	I’ll	promise.	It’s	a	little	different	for	me,	you	know.	You	can talk	about	something	like	that	all	you	want,	and	it’s	just	a	lot	of	hot	air.	I’m	an officer	in	the	National	Guard.	If	I	start	talking	like	that,	it	really	is	treason,	and	I could	go	to	jail,	or	lose	my	command.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	frowned.	“Would	you	rather	lose	your	command	or	your	dignity?	Your freedom?	How	much	is	too	much,	Ken?	As	far	as	I’m	concerned,	they	crossed the	line	when	they	started	shooting	civilians	during	a	political	demonstration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	just	doesn’t	fly.	Not	with	me,	and	not	with	most	folks	around	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	just	my	dignity	or	freedom	we’re	talking	about,	Dale,	it’s	my	kids	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	not	that	simple.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	problem	was	that	to	some	extent	Whitt	was	correct.	You	couldn’t	have	the federal	government	shooting	civilians.	But	this	wasn’t	the	way	to	deal	with	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	had	to	be	another	way	to	improve	the	situation.	A	way	that	didn’t	involve violence.	And	for	damn	sure,	no	independence	move	by	West	Virginia	could result	in	anything	but	more	violence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ok,	Whitt.	Let’s	talk	this	all	the	way	through.	Let’s	say	by	some	miracle	you get	yourself	elected.	What	happens	when	you	get	to	the	Senate?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	first	off,	there	are	some	folks	who	feel	the	same	way	as	I	do	already	in	the Senate,	and	more	running	for	seats	around	the	state.	I’m	not	operating	in	a vacuum;	I	fully	expect	to	get	some	support	once	I’m	there.	I’m	taking	two	steps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	running	for	the	office,	and	I’m	starting	a	petition	campaign	to	amend	the State	Constitution	so	that	it’s	legal	to	secede.	Right	now	the	Constitution explicitly	rules	that	out.	Once	I’m	in	office,	we’ll	propose	a	bill	to	act	on	the amendment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can’t	win	this	one,	Whitt.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dale	smiled.	“You’re	probably	right.	But	if	I	can	get	a	legitimate	debate	going, that’s	something.	The	government	is	out	of	control,	Ken.	Way	out	of	control.	But if	I	can	get	even	a	few	votes—do	you	have	any	idea	what	kind	of	a	political firestorm	we’ll	create?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	shrugged.	“What	happens	if	you	succeed?	Do	you	think	the	President will	just	let	it	go?	Before	your	bill	ever	passes,	you’ll	have	the	Army	right	here</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>in	Highview,	and	all	over	the	rest	of	the	state.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	won’t	come	to	that,	Ken.	You	yourself	said	it—this	one	would	never	pass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	we	can	make	a	strong	as	hell	argument	for	reform.	We	have	to	make	the point,	Ken—both	to	the	government	and	to	the	rest	of	the	country.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	point	is	that,	Dale?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	can’t	bleed	us	dry.	They	can’t	take	all	the	coal	and	natural	gas	and	oil—</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	can’t	take	the	fruits	of	our	labor	while	our	people	struggle	in	mines,	and	not give	anything	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing	left	but	ice	in	Murphy’s	glass.	He	raised	his	hand	to	catch	the	attention of	the	waitress,	pointed	to	the	empty	glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	still	think	you’re	crazy	to	be	pursuing	this.	I	hear	what	you	are	saying—and	I agree	with	some	of	it—but	I	can’t	support	you,	Dale.	I	just	can’t	do	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	understand.	If	nothing	else,	I	appreciate	you	listening,	not	charging	out	of	here like	the	Mayor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	shrugged.	“Man’s	got	to	have	his	say.	I	wouldn’t	mind	hearing	more	of your	plans,	anyhow.	If	nothing	else,	it’ll	be	an	interesting	election	for	a	change this	year.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	it	will,	Colonel.	That	it	will.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">June	20</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	opened	the	door	a	few	inches	and	knocked.	Clark	was	on	the	phone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hold	on	please,”	he	said	to	his	caller,	then	covered	the	handset	with	his	left hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Al,	I’ve	got	good	news.	Your	appointment	with	the	President	is	at	three.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great.	Can	you	pull	together	a	quick	briefing	packet?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	already	done.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	smiled,	went	back	to	the	phone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	hurried	back	to	her	desk.	She	had	prepared	an	information	packet targeted	at	the	media,	but	had	hoped	they	would	be	called	on	to	meet	with	the President.	The	information	in	the	packet	was	targeted	to	put	as	much	pressure	on Saturn	as	possible.	First,	a	brief	on	the	workers	of	the	Highview	plant	and	quotes from	past	Saturn	press	releases	that	highlighted	the	engineering	and	technical advances	made	by	the	employees	of	the	plant.	Economic	data:	out	of	a population	of	less	than	five	thousand,	Saturn	had	provided	eight	hundred	jobs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	the	plant	closed,	the	town	would	be	devastated.	Next,	a	list	of	those	killed in	the	violence.	Not	extremists	or	anti-government	activists,	as	the	Secretary	of Homeland	Security	claimed,	but	good,	hardworking	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	Valerie,”	one	of	the	other	aides	called.	“Did	you	see	this?”	It	was	Megan McClain,	one	of	the	interns,	annoyingly	cute	and	incompetent.	She	held	a magazine	up	in	the	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	did	a	double	take.	Standing	up,	she	marched	over	and	snatched	the magazine	out	of	the	intern’s	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	dramatic	photograph	of	her	father	was	splashed	on	the	cover	of	Newsweek, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a>tear	gas	roiling	around	him,	giving	CPR	to	Shannon	Firkus.	It	put	Ken	Murphy in	an	almost	heroic	light—something	he	would	not	appreciate.	Across	the bottom	of	the	page	were	the	words,	“Violence	in	West	Virginia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Opening	the	magazine,	she	saw	another	large	photo	of	him,	this	time	in	uniform, testifying	before	the	House.  <i class="calibre3">Dad	is	going	to	be	so	pissed	when	he	sees	this, </i>	she thought.	She	read	through	the	article,	which	described	the	events	of	the	last	two weeks	in	Highview	in	significant	detail.	Photos	of	David	and	Shannon	Firkus, when	David	was	a	baby.	A	sideline	article	on	Nelson	Barclay	highlighting	the fact	that	the	plant	was	profitable,	just	not	profitable	enough	for	one	of	the	richest men	in	America.	The	article	also	pointed	out	that	due	to	an	accounting	anomaly, Saturn	had	not	paid	a	dime	in	federal	taxes	in	the	last	three	years,	despite	how profitable	it	was.	Saturn	issued	a	brief	statement	expressing	“regret”	for	the deaths,	but	of	course	denying	any	responsibility	for	the	chain	of	events	that	led up	to	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	County	Prosecutor	in	Harpers	Ferry	had	called	a	grand	jury	to	investigate	a charge	of	excessive	force	in	the	raid,	indicating	that	homicide	charges	against	the federal	officers	might	result.	She	would	have	to	check	into	that.	If	charges	were brought	against	the	DHS	by	the	local	jurisdiction,	it	would	bolster	their argument. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	thought	about	copying	the	article	and	placing	it	in	the	packet	for	the President.	It	painted	a	far	different	picture	of	the	situation	than	the	DHS	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Why	not? </i>	She	made	a	copy	of	the	article,	then	returned	the	magazine	to	Megan, thanking	her.	The	article,	with	its	dramatic	cover	photo,	should	help	set	the impression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	checked	her	watch.	Noon.	Two	hours	before	they	would	leave	for	the	White House.	She	paced	across	the	room,	then	back,	and	looked	out	the	window.	The sky	over	the	bare	courtyard	was	tinged	brown	with	pollution.	Another	code	red day.	They	were	becoming	more	and	more	common	every	summer.	Last	summer half	a	dozen	deaths	in	DC	were	attributed	to	heat	and	pollution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	across	the	room.	Megan	sat	at	her	desk	painting	her	nails.	For	God’s sake,	couldn’t	she	find	a	better	place	to	do	that,	or	something	more	productive	to do	at	work?	Valerie	started	in	her	direction,	scowling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ambrose	Hall	stepped	in	front	of	her.	“Hey,	Valerie,	no	point	in	sitting	around</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>here	getting	nervous.	Let’s	grab	some	lunch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	stopped	and	demanded,	“Who’s	nervous?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ambrose	gave	her	a	wicked	grin.	“Maybe	not	nervous,	but	you	were	about	to bite	someone’s	head	off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	closed	her	eyes.	“You’re	right.	Let’s	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	on	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	way.	You	bought	last	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	they	walked	toward	to	the	door,	Ambrose	leaned	over	the	intern’s	desk	and said	in	a	stage	whisper,	“Honey,	you	better	put	the	nail	polish	away.	You	don’t want	to	cross	Valerie.	She’ll	be	writing	your	recommendation	letter	at	the	end	of the	summer.	Maybe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	waited	until	they	were	outside,	then	punched	Ambrose	in	the	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	jerk!	I’m	not	that	bad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	you	remember	Mike	Wilson?	He	used	to	look	like	a	deer	caught	in	the headlights	when	you	got	to	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	wasn’t	my	fault.	He	was	just	horny	and	afraid	of	girls.	Kid	needed	to	get laid	is	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ambrose	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	a	few	minutes,	they	reached	the	cafeteria	in	the	basement	of	the	Rayburn Building.	After	retrieving	their	food,	they	sat	and	talked	about	Hall’s	partner, who	had	been	offered	a	spectacular	job	with	a	prestigious	law	firm	in	Los Angeles.	A	benefit	of	moving	there,	of	course,	was	that	California	recognized same-sex	marriages.	Of	course,	the	DC	government	had	voted	to	recognize	them years	before	as	well,	but	Congress	had	intervened	and	reversed	the	decision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Either	way,	Hall	wasn’t	ready	to	quit	his	job.	He	loved	working	on	the	Hill	and didn’t	want	to	consider	giving	it	up.	But	the	two	of	them	been	together	nearly	ten years,	and	were	struggling	over	what	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	was	grateful	and	somewhat	distracted	when	they	returned	to	the	office. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>She	sat	down	at	her	desk,	tinkered	with	the	briefing	packet	and	fidgeted nervously.	Half	an	hour.	She	spent	the	last	few	minutes	checking	the	latest	news, scanning	for	information	about	DHS,	then	got	up	and	knocked	on	Clark’s	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Time	for	us	to	get	going,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great.	You	have	the	briefing	packet	ready?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	all	set.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	walked	out	the	sizeable	entrance	to	the	office	into	the	hall.	With	wide marble	floors	and	high	ceilings,	ornate	stonework	and	graceful	columns,	the buildings	on	Capitol	Hill	always	made	her	think	of	the	ancient	Roman	republic and	its	timeless	institutions—timeless	until,	after	hundreds	of	years,	it	lost	its checks	and	balances	and	the	republic	became	a	sham. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	to	the	front	entrance,	they	walked	down	the	steps	at	the	Independence Avenue	entrance	and	Valerie	stood	on	the	curb	and	stuck	out	a	hand.	Three minutes	later	they	were	in	the	back	seat	of	a	cab	on	their	way	to	the	White House.	When	it	stopped	at	15th	and	New	York	Avenue	they	climbed	out	at	the corner,	next	to	the	Treasury	building.	From	there,	they	walked	to	the	west	wing entrance	and	showed	their	identification	to	the	guards.	After	fifteen	minutes	of security	checks,	they	were	led	upstairs	by	one	of	the	President’s	aides	and	into the	Oval	Office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	sit	here,”	the	aide	said.	“The	President	will	be	back	shortly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	sat	on	the	uncomfortable	antique	couch.	A	matching	one	faced	them	across the	coffee	table,	both	couches	sitting	near	the	Seal	of	the	President	emblazoned across	the	floor.	Against	the	wall,	halfway	between	the	desk	and	the	table	and chairs	where	they	sat,	stood	a	gangly	man	in	a	black	suit	and	tie.	Secret	service. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	didn’t	acknowledge	them,	but	Valerie	knew	he	was	acutely	aware	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Minutes	later	President	Wendell	Price	walked	into	the	room,	his	presence immediately	filling	the	space.	They	both	stood	at	the	entry	of	the	unusually	tall man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Representative	Clark?	A	pleasure	to	finally	meet	you	in	person.	And	this	is	your assistant?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a>“Valerie	Murphy,	Mr.	President,”	she	said.	Valerie	and	Clark	shook	hands	with the	tall,	florid	faced	man.	Valerie	thought	his	voice	was	even	more	engaging	in person	than	on	television.	His	meaty	hands	engulfed	hers	when	they	shook. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	have	a	seat,”	he	said.	“I	have	to	tell	you	up	front,	I’ve	only	got	a	few minutes	before	my	next	meeting,	but	we	felt	this	was	very	important	and	we should	meet.	The	situation	over	there	is	pretty	grave,	isn’t	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,”	Clark	said.	“We’re	hoping	to	discuss	two	things	with	you	today,	sir. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	first,	as	you	may	know,	is	that	the	County	Prosecutor	in	Harpers	Ferry	is investigating	charges	of	excessive	force	and	homicide	during	the	DHS	raid.	I wanted	to	make	sure	you	were	aware	of	this,	and	to	ask	you	to	ask	the	Justice Department	to	also	investigate.	The	charges	are	quite	serious,	sir—a	DHS	agent shot	and	killed	at	least	one	unarmed	bystander,	and	the	team	assaulted	a	number of	others.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	President	arched	his	eyebrows.	“I	know	the	DHS	has	a	bad	reputation,	but they	are	not	bad	people.	I	find	these	charges	difficult	to	credit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	that’s	why	we	are	asking	for	an	investigation.	I	know	some	of	the	people involved,	Mr.	President.	These	are	not	criminals;	some	of	them	are	pillars	of	our community.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	President	tilted	his	head	to	the	left.	“Then	why	were	they	trespassing	on private	property?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	spoke	up.	“Sir,	that’s	the	other	issue	we’d	like	to	discuss	with	you.	As you	may	know,	the	Saturn	Microsystems	manufacturing	plant	in	Highview closed	a	month	ago,	laying	off	all	the	workers.	The	plant	moved	to	Indonesia, where	the	company	can	exploit	cheap	labor.	Again,	the	entire	workforce	was	laid off	without	notice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I’m	sorry	to	see	jobs	leave	the	United	States,	but	I	hardly	see	where	the federal	government	comes	in	to	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	replied,	visibly	struggling	to	keep	his	tone	level.	“Sir,	the	federal government	came	into	this	when	it	started	shooting	the	citizens	of	my	district. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	federal	government	is	in	this	thing	up	to	its	neck,	Mr.	President.	It	was	a simple	labor	dispute	before	the	DHS	stepped	in,	called	my	people	terrorists	and attacked	them	with	a	large	combat	force.	Now,	this	was	a	profitable	plant.	Saturn</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>shut	the	plant	down	and	moved	it	not	because	they	were	losing	money,	but	to increase	their	margins.	This	will	economically	devastate	the	town.	The	workers met	with	attorneys	and	banks,	and	then	made	an	offer	to	Saturn	to	buy	the	plant and	license	the	technology.	Saturn	would	get	pure	profit.	Unfortunately,	they turned	the	workers	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	watched	the	President	as	Clark	spoke.	Something	about	his	expression just	wasn’t	clicking	Maybe	it	was	the	makeup	he	wore;	he	must	have	been	on TV	this	morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	can	we	do	about	it?”	President	Price	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Two	things,	sir.	First,	federal	prosecutors	are	harassing	the	townspeople	and hitting	them	with	outrageous	charges,	accusing	them	of	being	anti-government conspirators	and	worse.	Second,	even	though	the	federal	government	can’t	do anything	to	fix	the	situation,	you	know	Nelson	Barclay	and	have	some	influence with	him.	Sir,	you	can	ask	him	to	allow	the	workers	to	buy	the	plant.	Allow	them to	have	their	economic	lives	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	this	time,	the	President	had	leaned	back	in	his	chair	and	rested	his	chin	in	his hand.	Valerie	tensed.	The	President	looked	almost	sympathetic	as	he	stared	at Clark,	but	it	seemed	disingenuous	to	Valerie.	She	didn’t	trust	him,	and	the sympathetic	look	turned	on	and	off	like	a	light	switch	whenever	he	wanted	it	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Abruptly	Price	narrowed	his	eyes,	and	then	shook	his	head	in	the	negative.	“Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark,	I’m	surprised	at	you.	If	I	were	to	interfere	in	an	ongoing	investigation being	conducted	by	the	Justice	Department,	you	and	your	friends	on	the	Hill would	be	all	over	me	with	ethics	investigations.	I	most	certainly	will	not	do	that, nor	will	I	pressure	a	private	company—_private,_	mind	you—to	change	its policies	to	suit	your	needs.	Now,	I	will	take	what	you	have	said	into consideration,	but	I	must	say,	Mr.	Clark,	I	am	disappointed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark’s	face	was	wooden,	and	Valerie	was	stunned.	She	had	not	known	what	to expect—a	noncommittal	answer	maybe.	“I’ll	think	about	it.”	Something	like that.	Not	this	outright	refusal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,”	the	President	said,	“if	that	is	all,	I	have	to	go	on	to	my	next	meeting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	President,	please	hear	me	out.	This	is	a	critical	issue.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>President	Price	shrugged.	“Mr.	Clark,	I	don’t	see	anything	further	to	discuss.	I appreciate	your	concern	for	your	constituents,	but	it	just	wouldn’t	be	ethical	for me	to	intervene.	You	must	understand.	It	was	a	pleasure	meeting	both	of	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	President	turned	and	walked	out	of	the	Oval	Office.	Clark	and	Valerie looked	at	each	other,	downcast.	And	then	they	were	escorted	out	of	the	office	by the	silent	Secret	Service	agent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,”	Clark	said.	“What	do	we	have	today?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	handed	out	copies	of	the	schedule	to	Clark,	Ambrose	and	Dan	Harris, Clark’s	Press	Secretary.	The	sun	had	not	been	up	long,	and	the	pale	dawn	shone in	through	the	windows.	The	treeless	courtyard	looked	desolate	in	this	light.	The air	conditioning	was	broken	again;	it	was	going	to	be	another	hot	day	in	the office.	Ambrose,	Clark,	and	Dan	had	already	doffed	their	coats	and	ties	and rolled	up	their	sleeves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Meetings	this	morning,”	Valerie	said.	“Plastics	Association	at	nine	o’clock, Veterans	for	Justice	at	nine	forty-five,	you	get	a	break,	then	the	Airline	Pilots Association	at	ten	thirty.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	rolled	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	continued,	“A	tour	group	from	Morgantown	is	coming	through	at	eleven thirty.	You’re	scheduled	to	shake	hands	and	take	a	group	photo	on	the	capitol steps	with	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	when	do	I	get	to	do	some	real	work?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Afternoon	is	a	little	better,	sir;	we’ve	got	a	meeting	with	Senator	Parkinson	and his	staff	to	talk	strategy	on	the	Skaggs	Bill.	We’re	holding	back	a	tidal	wave	on this	bill;	Skaggs	has	more	than	a	hundred	co-sponsors	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	keep	trying.	Anything	in	the	news?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Three	major	items,”	she	said,	and	handed	out	another	sheet.	“Last	night	in Morgantown	a	white	police	officer	shot	and	killed	a	twelve-year-old	black	boy—</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	kid	was	walking	home	from	the	grocery	store,	his	mother	was	sick. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a>Apparently	the	kid	ran	when	the	cops	tried	to	stop	him,	so	they	opened	fire.	It looks	pretty	clear	cut	to	me,	based	on	the	media	coverage,	but	Mayor	Scafella hasn’t	taken	any	action	on	similar	incidents	in	the	past,	and	the	all-white	City Council	hasn’t	either.	Expect	demonstrations.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dan,	the	press	secretary,	spoke	up.	“Al,	we	should	work	out	a	statement	on	this right	away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	assented.	“Work	out	something	this	morning	and	let	me	see	it.	What	else?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Second,	the	Grand	Jury	in	Harpers	Ferry	has	subpoenaed	two	DHS	agents—a Lawrence	Harris	and	a	Ben	Matley—in	connection	with	the	Highview	shootings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">DHS	says	they	don’t	have	to	honor	the	subpoena.	They’re	appealing.	The attorney	general	was	on	Washington	Talk	this	morning	and	announced	that	not only	won’t	the	Justice	Department	investigate	the	shootings,	but	they	consider any	similar	claims	to	be	frivolous	and	unpatriotic.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	Clark	cried.	The	others	in	the	room	gasped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	quoting	him,	sir.	‘Anyone	who	says	Homeland	Security	overstepped	its bounds	is	making	a	frivolous	and	unpatriotic	gesture.’	He	then	suggested	similar incidents	would	merit	a	stronger	reaction.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dan,”	Clark	said	to	his	press	secretary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	want	something	on	this	today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Last	item,”	Valerie	said.	“Y’all	remember	Dale	Whitt?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	kind	of	a	crackpot,	isn’t	he?”	Ambrose	said,	raising	his	eyebrows	as	he looked	at	the	papers	Valerie	had	handed	him.	Whitt	was	well	known	in	the	office from	his	almost	weekly	letters	and	phone	calls	offering	his	perspective	on	every issue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	all	depends	on	your	perspective,”	Valerie	answered.	“Six	weeks	ago	I	would have	said	yes,	but	things	have	changed	a	great	deal,	and	his	perspective	just became	a	lot	more	mainstream.	He’s	putting	out	a	petition	to	get	a	referendum on	the	ballot	to	amend	Article	I	of	the	state	constitution,	and	make	it	possible	for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a>us	to	secede	from	the	United	States.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	crazy,”	Dan	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe,”	Clark	said,	“But	this	article	is	sympathetic.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly,”	Valerie	said.	“The	Sunday	editions	in	six	newspapers	ran	long, detailed	and	sympathetic	articles	on	him.	Six	of	them.	Not	one	critical	comment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Look	at	this	one	in	the	Charleston	Gazette.	Front	page	center.	Good	photo	of him.	It	makes	him	out	to	be	a	folk	hero.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dan	smirked.	“Valerie,	that	one’s	not	worth	wasting	your	time	on.	It’s	just	a	flash in	the	pan.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	see,”	she	said.	“I	think	it	bears	watching.	He’s	holding	his	first	rally	this weekend—in	Highview,	of	course,	because	of	the	shootings.	I	would	expect	a huge	turnout.	Sentiment	against	the	federal	government	runs	pretty	strong	there now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	you	blame	them?”	Clark	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	one	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	wasn’t	one	for	rallies,	but	he	had	to	admit,	his	curiousity	had	gotten	the better	of	him.	It	was	Saturday	morning,	and	there	was	nothing	to	keep	him	from having	breakfast	with	his	son	at	Sally’s.	Nothing	except	the	fact	they	were	broke, a	nagging	voice	kept	telling	him.	All	the	same,	they	had	arrived	early	enough	to get	a	booth	next	to	the	front	windows,	where	Murphy	could	see	across	the	street to	the	town	square.	He	came	armed	with	his	pocket	computer	for	Kenny—he would	get	restless	soon—and	a	newspaper	for	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Across	the	grassy	square,	two	black	Ford	SUVs	sat,	their	windows	tinted	almost black.	Not	far	away	from	the	vehicles,	two	men	in	suits	stood	in	the	shade	of	a tree,	one	shooting	photos	of	everyone	walking	through	the	square	with	a	high quality	camera.	Interesting,	and	very	disturbing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	minutes	before	nine,	Paul	Machen	drove	up	in	his	deputy	sheriff	patrol	car and	parked	directly	across	from	the	diner.	That	could	be	trouble;	the	Mayor	was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>pretty	pissed	with	Dale	Whitt.	Murphy	had	gotten	word	that	Whitt	had	been unable	to	procure	a	permit	for	his	rally	this	morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machen	stepped	out	of	the	car	and	ran	across	the	street,	straight	toward	the	diner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	got	inside,	he	walked	to	the	counter	and	ordered	a	cup	of	coffee,	then looked	around.	Murphy	nodded,	and	Machen	approached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Morning,	Colonel.	How’s	Valerie	doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Morning,	Paul.	She’s	okay…	Very	busy,	up	on	the	Hill.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Suppose	so.	You’re	here	early,	ain’t	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	shrugged	and	grinned.	“Thought	it	might	be	interesting	in	the	square today,	Paul.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Deputy	Machen	scowled.	“Ain’t	nothing	happening	in	the	square	today, Colonel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	a	word,	he	turned	away	and	paid	for	his	coffee,	then	walked	out	the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	took	a	sip	of	his	coffee	and	kept	watching	the	square,	as	Kenny	played	a video	game	on	the	handheld.	Dale	Whitt’s	ancient	brown	pickup	truck,	loaded high	with	equipment,	was	pulling	into	the	square.	Voices	in	the	restaurant dropped.	Looked	like	Murphy	wasn’t	the	only	person	who	had	positioned himself	to	see	events	unfold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machen	sat	on	the	trunk	of	his	patrol	car	and	waited	for	the	ancient	pickup, which	came	to	stop	right	behind	him.	Whitt	stepped	out	of	the	truck,	nodded	to Machen,	climbed	into	the	bed	of	the	truck	and	began	untying	equipment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	could	tell	the	Deputy	was	saying	something	angry	from	the	expression on	his	face.	Whitt	looked	up	from	the	speaker	he	was	working	on,	and	said something	to	Machen	with	a	winning	smile,	which	seemed	to	infuriate	the Deputy.	The	spectators	in	the	restaurant	gasped	when	Machen	pitched	his	coffee cup	at	Whitt,	narrowly	missing	him	and	the	equipment.	The	Deputy	stomped	to his	vehicle,	a	scowl	on	his	face,	then	got	in	and	sped	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	shook	his	head	and	continued	his	work.	After	a	few	minutes,	apparently finished,	he	spread	a	campaign	banner	across	back	of	the	truck:	“Whitt	for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a>Senate.	Give	me	Liberty	or	Give	me	Death.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	groaned.	That	was	too	much.	Way	too	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moments	later	Whitt	made	his	way	into	the	diner.	He	spotted	Murphy	on entering.	“Morning,	Colonel.	Can	I	join	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only	if	you	tell	me	what	it	was	you	said	that	sent	Paul	Machen	off	sulking	like a	two	year	old.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	chuckled	and	sat	down,	then	said	hello	to	Kenny.	The	boy	nodded,	not looking	up	from	his	game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	just	asked	him	if	the	sheriff	knew	he	was	here,	or	was	he	visiting	on	behalf	of his	daddy.	Sure	pissed	him	off.	What	do	you	think	that	means?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	nodded.	“Probably	means	you’re	going	to	have	some	trouble	with	him before	the	day	is	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	expect	so,”	Whitt	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	waitress	approached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	I	get	a	cup	of	coffee?”	Whitt	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only	if	you	promise	not	to	throw	it	at	me,”	she	said,	her	voice	low	and	sly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	and	Whitt	laughed,	then	talked	for	a	bit	about	local	politics.	These	were dangerous	times,	but	there	was	still	local	business	to	worry	about,	crops	to	bring in,	coal	to	bring	out	of	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every	time	someone	entered	the	building,	the	little	bell	over	the	swinging	door chimed,	and	Murphy	glanced	up.	So	he	saw	the	federal	agents	before	Whitt	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	went	on	talking	about	the	latest	news	from	Charleston	until	Murphy	held up	his	hand,	palm	forward,	signaling	him	to	stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	men,	both	in	black	suits	and	dark	ties	entered	the	restaurant.	Both	had	the seasoned	look	of	long-time	DHS	agents:	well	muscled,	a	little	bit	menacing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Earpieces	in	their	right	ears	were	connected	to	barely	visible	wires	that	led	under their	shirts.	Both	had	bulges	under	their	coats.	Dark	sunglasses	made	it</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a>impossible	to	see	where	they	were	looking.	Their	overall	appearance	was	so stereotypical	it	might	have	been	funny	if	hadn’t	been	so	menacing.	Murphy reminded	himself	that	just	a	few	weeks	before,	he	might	not	have	thought	of them	as	menacing	at	all.	A	lot	had	happened	since	then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	agents	went	to	the	counter	and	ordered	two	cups	of	coffee.	The	other stood	in	the	center	of	the	room	and	scanned	it,	turning	a	full	circle	in	the	room, then	stopped	and	seemed	to	fixate	on	the	table	where	Murphy	and	Dale	Whitt sat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	in	the	diner	was	silent	as	the	two	men	stood	there,	one	waiting	for	his order.	Murphy’s	skin	crawled;	the	fear	in	the	room	was	palpable,	the	only	noise coming	from	the	cook	behind	the	counter,	and	from	his	son’s	video	game. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">These	are	the	men	who	are	supposed	to	be	protecting	us, </i>	Murphy	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">They’ve	twisted	that	beyond	all	recognition. </i>	Instead	of	protecting	Americans, they	watched	them.	Instead	of	guarding	the	nation’s	liberties,	they	were	steadily eliminating	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	turned	his	mind	back	to	the	Esther	Rosen	case,	a	few	years	back.	Rosen	was	a private	attorney,	and	something	of	an	eccentric.	She	had	taken	on	Hamas	as	a client	in	a	federal	lawsuit	challenging	their	designation	by	the	DHS	as	a	terrorist organization,	arguing	that	their	humanitarian	activities	were	separate	from	their militant	ones.	Rosen	disappeared	in	the	middle	of	the	lawsuit.	Media	speculation had	been	rife:	had	she	been	kidnapped	or	murdered?	Had	her	terrorist	clients gone	crazy	and	done	her	in? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	she	turned	up	in	Australia,	of	all	places,	and	told	a	story	that	should	have been	instructive	to	all	Americans.	She	had	been	arrested	by	the	DHS,	and	in	a secret	tribunal	stripped	of	her	American	citizenship	in	the	absence	of	counsel	or any	contact	with	her	family.	After	four	years,	she’d	finally	been	released	and	put on	a	plane	out	of	the	country,	stateless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	citizenship	provision,	passed	in	the	early	part	of	the	century,	had	rarely	been used,	but	it	allowed	for	the	government	to	strip	someone	of	their	citizenship involuntarily	if	associated	with	terrorist	groups.	Had	anyone	imagined	it	would be	turned	against	attorneys	in	the	middle	of	a	lawsuit? </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	struck	Murphy	about	the	case	was	that	there	was	a	temporary	splash	in	the media,	a	small	scandal,	but	one	that	wasn’t	that	juicy—no	sex,	no	murders,	just	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>plodding	beauracracy	rolling	over	someone’s	life.	He	didn’t	know	how	it	had turned	out,	what	had	happened	to	Rosen	in	the	end.	Was	she	still	in	Australia? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sitting	here	now,	with	this	menacing	federal	agent	staring	at	him	in	a	public restaurant,	he	desperately	needed	to	know.	Murphy	was	no	fan	of	anyone	who dealt	with	terrorists	like	Hamas—he’d	served	in	one	too	many	combat	zones dealing	with	car	bombs	and	suicide	bombers	to	have	any	sympathy	for	her.	At the	same	time—secret	tribunals	and	midnight	arrests?	That	wasn’t	the	country he’d	grown	up	believing	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	moment	passed,	and	the	agents	got	their	coffee	and	left	the	hostile restaurant.	Conversation	resumed,	though	hushed;	as	if	some	residue	from	the DHS	remained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dale,”	the	waitress	called.	“Isn’t	that	your	truck	over	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmmm?”	Whitt	said	and	looked	up.	A	bright	red	tow	truck	had	parked	in	front of	Whitt’s	pickup,	and	the	driver	was	jacking	it	up.	Murphy	shook	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	known	the	thrown	coffee	cup	wouldn’t	be	the	end	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	damn,”	Whitt	said,	and	stood.	“Heather,	can	I	come	back	and	settle	up	in	a little	while?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	go	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	stepped	outside	and	trotted	across	the	street.	Murphy	stood	and	leaned down	to	his	son.	“You	stay	here,”	he	said.	Kenny	nodded,	and	Murphy	stepped outside	the	front	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machen	stood	across	the	small	street,	writing	in	his	citation	book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Deputy,	I	suggest	you	stop	this	game	right	now,”	Whitt	said,	his	voice	pitched just	a	little	too	high. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machen	grinned.	“What	game	is	that,	Mr.	Red	Communist?	Is	this	your	truck?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	it	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I’m	afraid	I’m	having	it	impounded.	As	you	can	see,	it	is	not	displaying license	tags,	and	it	is	parked	illegally.	You	can	pick	it	up	at	the	County	impound lot	on	Monday	morning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a>“God	damn	it,	Machen,”	Whitt	shouted.	“You	know	this	truck	is	licensed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What’d	you	do	with	the	plate?	Is	it	in	your	goddamn	car?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Machen,	you	are	dangerously	close	to	obstructing	an	officer.	I’m	not	going to	have	to	take	you	in,	am	I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	have	your	badge	for	this,	you	son	of	a	bitch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Whitt,	I’m	afraid	I’m	placing	you	under	arrest.	Please	hold	your	hands	out to	your	side.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt’s	face	flushed.	“I’ll	do	no	such	thing,”	he	shouted,	inches	away	from Machen’s	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	younger	man	shoved	Machen	back,	then	reached	for	his	belt	and	pulled	out his	baton. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	please	place	your	hands	behind	your	head,	right	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	enough.	Murphy	stepped	into	the	street	and	approached	the	scene. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Paul	Machen,	you	know	as	well	as	I	do	this	is	wrong.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	deputy	glanced	over	at	him,	his	face	red	with	anger.	“I	don’t	know	any	such thing,	Colonel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	had	stepped	back	from	Machen,	apparently	realizing	events	had	turned	a dangerous	corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Deputy,	you	need	to	rethink	this,”	Whitt	started.	He	did	not	finish,	because Machen	cracked	the	baton	across	his	chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hands	behind	your	head,  <i class="calibre3">now. </i>	Lace	those	fingers	together.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Whitt	complied,	Murphy	noticed	a	large	crowd	was	gathering	from	around the	square,	watching	the	situation.	They	were	folks	early	for	the	rally	scheduled to	start	in	a	little	over	an	hour.	They	did	not	look	happy	as	Machen	grabbed	one of	Whitt’s	wrists	and	twisted	it	around	behind	his	back,	cuffed	it,	then	pulled	the other	one	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dale	Whitt,	I’m	placing	you	under	arrest	for	assaulting	an	officer,	obstruction</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>of	an	officer	conducting	official	business,	and	for	resisting	arrest.	You	have	the right	to	remain	silent.	You	have	the	right	to	an	attorney.	If	you	cannot	afford	an attorney,	one	will	be	appointed	for	you.	Do	you	understand	these	rights?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	also	have	the	right	to	sue	you	for	violating	my	civil	rights.	Do	you	understand that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Personally,”	Machen	answered,	“you	can	kiss	my	ass	with	your	civil	rights.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	spoke	urgently.	“Deputy	Machen,	you’re	making	a	big	mistake.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	want	to	shut	the	hell	up,	Colonel?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	in	the	crowd	hissed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Deputy’s	gunning	to	be	a	DHS	agent,”	someone	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	gonna	arrest	us	too?”	a	young	woman	shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,	Deputy.	Why	don’tcha	arrest	all	of	us.	I’m	sure	you	can	make	up something	to	charge	us	with.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machen	flinched	back	from	the	menacing	crowd	and	shoved	Whitt	ahead	of	him, toward	the	patrol	car.	His	eyes	cut	over	to	the	federal	agents	across	the	square taking	pictures	with	a	telescopic	lens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	you	looking	at	them	for,	Machen?	You	gonna	be	a	fed?	Think	they’re going	to	come	help	you	out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machen	shouted	at	the	growing	crowd,	his	face	red.	“Y’all	go	on	home	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ain’t	no	permit	to	demonstrate.	Ain’t	gonna	be	no	rally	anyhow,	not	with	this scumbag	in	lockup.	Go	on	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	burly	man	in	jeans	and	a	red	t-shirt	pushed	his	way	to	the	fore	of	the	crowd, his	face	almost	as	dark	as	the	shirt,	his	expression	murder.	He	spoke	in	a	low, dangerous	tone.	“Why	don’t	you	make	me,	Mr.	Deputy?	Why	don’t	you	make	us all?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machen	turned	his	back,	shoved	Whitt	into	the	patrol	car,	and	closed	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	speaker	was	Joe	Blankenship,	whose	wife	had	been	killed	at	the	Saturn</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a>plant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,	Mr.	Deputy.	Looks	like	you	belong	over	there	with	the	feds,	shooting up	people	who	are	just	minding	their	own	business.	You	going	to	shoot	me?	You going	to	throw	me	in	jail?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machen	looked	around.	His	left	eyebrow	started	to	twitch.	At	least	thirty	people surrounded	him	now.	He	stood	with	his	back	to	his	patrol	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Y’all	go	on,	now,”	he	said,	his	voice	no	longer	so	confident	as	the	townspeople</p>
<p class="calibre1">—his	lifelong	neighbors	and	friends—surrounded	him,	angry.	He	got	in	the	car and	slammed	the	door.	Joe	Blankenship	said	something	to	the	others	near	him, and	set	the	others	laughing	as	they	looked	in	at	him.	Inside	the	car,	Machen’s face	flushed.	Blankenship	pointed	at	him,	made	his	fingers	into	the	shape	of	a pistol,	index	finger	extended,	then	pulled	the	“trigger.”	Inside,	Machen	looked bewhildered,	almost	as	if	he	was	going	to	cry.	He	put	the	patrol	car	in	gear	and jerked	forward	too	fast	for	such	a	crowded	situation.	A	young	woman	barely	had time	to	jump	out	of	the	way	of	the	car	as	he	sped	up	the	street,	away	from	the town	square. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	glanced	back	at	the	diner.	Kenny	still	sat	at	the	booth	facing	the window,	playing	his	video	game.	He’d	keep	for	a	few	more	minutes.	A	few	yards away	stood	Joe	Blankenship,	face	still	flushed.	Murphy	approached	him,	held out	his	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joe,”	he	said.	“I’m	so	sorry	about	Mandy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blankenship	took	the	hand	and	pulled	Murphy	toward	him,	grasping	his shoulders.	His	face	was	twisted	in	anguish.	“Thank	you,	Colonel.	You	know	she loved	working	up	there,	always	said	you	were	a	good	boss.	Look,	we	got	to	do something.	Whitt’s	done	nothing	but	the	right	thing,	standing	up	for	our	rights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	they’ve	gone	and	arrested	him.	What	the	hell	is	wrong	with	the	Sheriff?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	grimaced.	“Somehow	I	doubt	the	Sheriff	knew	what	was	going	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machen’s	daddy	gave	him	his	instructions	on	this	one.	What	you	need	to	do	is talk	to	the	press	when	they	get	here	for	the	rally.	Tell	them	what	happened,	and hold	the	rally	without	Whitt.	You	can	get	up	there	and	speak	as	easily	as	he	can.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	think	so,	Colonel?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a>“Sure,	why	not?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	figure	you	would	support	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	frowned.	“I	don’t.	But	I’ll	be	damned	if	I’ll	see	Americans	arrested because	they	have	the	wrong	political	opinion.	Spits	in	the	face	of	everything	we are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blankenship	clapped	his	hand	on	Murphy’s	shoulder,	and	his	face	screwed	up, on	the	verge	of	tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mandy	would	want	me	to	speak	up.	I’ll	do	it,	Colonel.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">June	27</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A	drop	of	sweat	crawled	down	Morris’	back	as	he	stood	in	front	of	his	assembled company.	At	0800	hours,	the	sun	already	beat	down	on	them	mercilessly.	It	was going	to	be	a	hot	day,	over	a	hundred	degrees.	They	stood	on	the	edge	of	a parking	lot,	close	to	where	their	tents	had	stood	for	the	last	four	weeks,	next	to the	ruins	of	the	shopping	center.	Damaged	buildings	and	debris	still	scattered	the area,	but	the	Army’s	job	was	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	done	a	good	job	out	here.	We	came	into	a	dangerous	situation	a	month ago,	and	each	of	you	has	seen	things	we’d	have	rather	not	seen.	We’ll	talk	more on	that	subject,	quite	a	bit,	but	in	the	meantime,	I	want	you	to	remember	a couple	of	key	points	here.	Because	of	your	work,	the	Department	of	Homeland Security	has	been	able	to	collect	the	evidence	they	needed	to	identify	the terrorists,	and	yesterday	afternoon	they	filed	charges	against	those	who	were responsible	for	this	terrible	crime.	Because	of	your	work,	the	site	was	secured and	civilians	were	protected.	You	can	all	be	proud	of	yourselves	for	the outstanding	jobs	you’ve	done.	First	Sergeant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	his	order,	the	first	sergeant	marched	back	in	front.	The	men	and	women noticeably	straightened	as	the	no-nonsense	NCO	walked	to	the	front	of	the formation.	Morris	might	be	the	commander	of	the	unit,	but	he	knew	that	the enlisted	men	and	women	tiptoed	around	the	first	sergeant.	In	their	lives,	he	was the	one	with	the	real	authority.	Though	gruff	and	almost	aggressive	in	his manner,	he	sometimes	seemed	like	a	mother	hen	clucking	over	a	brood	of chicks.	The	troops	didn’t	know	how	good	they	had	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Load	them	up,	First	Sergeant,”	Morris	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	walked	away,	leaving	the	first	sergeant	to	direct	the	company	onto	buses for	the	ride	back	to	Fort	Meade.	Small	puffs	of	ash	and	debris	rose	around	his feet	as	he	walked.	He	paused,	squinting	from	the	glare,	and	stared	up	at	the	still damaged	mall.	Workers	had	built	scaffolding,	and	were	replacing	the	blown	out windows.	It	would	still	be	weeks	before	the	area	was	cleaned	up,	and	probably</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a>years	before	the	buildings	were	rebuilt	or	repaired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lieutenant	Colonel	Barksdale	was	talking	on	the	phone	when	Morris approached.	Morris	stayed	back	a	respectful	distance	while	Barksdale	finished his	phone	call. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	my	company	is	loaded.	We’re	ready	to	move.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barksdale	studied	Morris,	eyes	squinted,	like	a	teacher	examining	a	problematic student.	His	comment	came	as	a	surprise	to	Morris.	“Well,	Captain	Morris, despite	first	impressions,	you’ve	done	a	solid	job	out	here.	You	should	be	proud of	your	company.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	sir.	They	were	well	tuned	when	I	arrived.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	then.	We’ll	see	you	back	at	the	post.	When	you	get	back,	have	your folks	clean	and	turn	in	their	weapons,	then	send	them	home	for	three	days.	I’ll plan	to	meet	with	you	and	the	other	company	commanders	at	oh	seven	hundred hours	tomorrow	morning	to	go	over	next	week’s	training	schedule.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,”	Morris	said.	Alicia	would	be	thrilled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barksdale	turned	and	walked	away	without	another	word,	and	Morris	was	left	to wonder	whether	he	was	expected	to	follow	the	Colonel	or	if	he’d	been dismissed.	Barksdale	continued	marching	away	without	looking	back,	so	Morris shrugged	and	headed	back	to	the	company.	It	was	already	turning	out	to	be	a scorcher. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today	Morris	had	completed	his	first	month	in	command.	Some	month.	He	had wanted	to	be	an	officer	in	the	Army	ever	since,	as	a	fifteen-year-old	kid	growing up	in	Kentucky	coal	country	near	the	border	of	West	Virginia,	he	had	seen	his cousin	come	home	from	Afghanistan.	Lucas	Morris	had	been	nothing	but	a lanky	kid	when	he	left	for	the	Army.	When	he	came	home	from	Afghanistan, he’d	become	a	man	who	commanded	respect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	military	became	a	lifelong	fascination	for	Morris,	driving	him	to	college	as an	ROTC	cadet	at	the	top	of	his	class	and	on	to	the	Regular	Army.	What	was	the alternative?	Coal	mining?	He’d	seen	enough	of	that	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	here	he	was,	the	tip	of	the	spear,	in	command	of	a	line	infantry	company, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>and	half	the	time	he	didn’t	know	what	was	coming	next. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	drive	back,	Morris	and	his	driver	didn’t	talk.	Instead,	he	worked	on	notes for	the	upcoming	weeks,	including	training	plans	and	leave	for	the	men	and women	in	the	company.	He	found	it	difficult	to	concentrate.	He’d	not	seen	Alicia since	their	last	conversation,	which	hadn’t	exactly	gone	well.	They	had	not written,	only	had	a	couple	of	brief	telephone	calls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	like	the	old	days,	he	thought.	Five	years	ago,	they	phoned	every	day	when he	was	in	the	field.	Hard	to	imagine	what	it	must	have	been	like	in	the	military	in the	days	before	satellite	phones	and	advanced	communications.	Two	or	three decades	ago	troops	went	overseas	for	years	at	a	time	without	any	contact	with their	families	other	than	letters.	During	Morris’	overseas	deployments	he	was able	to	call	home	inexpensively	on	his	personal	satellite	phone.	Substantial communications	power	was	now	within	the	reach	of	lowest	ranking	private soldier.	The	world	had	indeed	grown	smaller.	The	hard	part	now	was	keeping	the troops	from	taking	their	phones	with	them	on	guard	duty,	though	being	caught with	one	while	on	duty	was	treated	as	severely	as	falling	asleep	or	drinking would	be.	Wasn’t	anything	much	worse	than	being	in	a	concealed	observation post	and	having	your	phone	ring—except	maybe	losing	your	buddy	because	of it.	Soldiering	was	serious	business,	and	with	a	dozen	or	more	combat deployments	in	the	last	two	decades,	it	had	become	deadly	serious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	when	he	thought	of	home,	a	cold	lump	of	anxiety	twisted	his	stomach	and stiffened	his	neck.	No	question	she	would	lash	out	at	him	when	he	got	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Might	be	a	day	or	two,	or	even	a	week,	but	within	ten	days	at	the	maximum	he would	feel	her	fury.	When	it	came,	her	verbal	tirade	would	cut	to	the	soul,	and	it always	came	back	to	the	same	thing:	leave	the	Army,	leave	the	Army.	Live	a normal	life.	Go	be	a	lawyer	or	a	CPA	or	a	teacher	or	anything—anything	other than	a	soldier.	Be	a	congressman,	like	her	father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	he	had	a	dollar	for	every	time	she’d	suggested	his	military	experience	could help	a	political	career,	he’d	be	able	to	afford	to	buy	his	own	election.	He	always wanted	to	point	out	that	his	military	experience	would	help	him	where	it mattered	most:	with	his	military	career. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Ah,	well, </i>	he	thought.  <i class="calibre3">Enough	self-pity. </i>	He	would	be	home	soon	enough,	and	in	a few	days	it	would	come,	and	then	it	would	be	over.	Except	every	time	it happened	he	wanted	to	go	home	a	little	less.  <i class="calibre3">Let’s	face	it. </i>	If	it	wasn’t	for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>Savannah,	he	would	have	left	her	years	ago.	But	even	that	was	based	on	a	false premise.	If	it	weren’t	for	Savannah,	he	never	would	have	married	her	in	the	first place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	a	crummy	thing	to	think.	But	sometimes	he	felt	that	cold.	He	tried	to	go back	to	his	notes,	but	no	luck.	He	just	stared	out	the	window.	He’d	be	home	soon enough.	He	brushed	sweat	out	of	his	eyes	and	wished	he	were	happy	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Monday	morning	dawned	unusually	cold	and	wet	in	West	Virginia,	but	that didn’t	stop	the	crowd	gathering	around	the	ramp	in	front	of	the	Jefferson	County Sheriff’s	Department.	Karen	tried	to	count.	There	must	have	been	five	hundred people	out	there,	maybe	more.	Not	much	light	yet,	but	not	too	dark	to	see	the signs	that	read	“Free	Dale	Whitt,”	“Recall	George	Machen,”	and	one,	“Give	me Liberty	or	Give	me	Death.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	around,	but	did	not	see	Murphy.	Of	course,	he	had	a	six-year-old	son to	take	care	of.	Given	the	way	things	had	gone	recently,	this	demonstration	was likely	to	be	shut	down	by	the	police	in	a	hurry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	media	was	out	in	force,	including	the	nationals	like	CNN	and	MSNBC. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Good	news.	At	least	somebody	was	taking	them	seriously.	Traffic	was completely	blocked:	it	was	a	two-lane	road	here	in	front	of	the	Sheriff’s Department,	and	the	people	spilled	out	into	the	street.	She	pulled	her	raincoat tighter	as	the	water	poured	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	look	around,	and	there	they	were.	The	ubiquitous	federal	agents	and their	cameras	stood	across	the	street	in	the	lee	of	the	city	government	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every	time	she	saw	someone	taking	pictures	now	it	turned	her	stomach.	Were they	building	a	file?	Preparing	for	prosecutions?	Karen	had	never	attended	a demonstration	in	her	life;	would	this	one	be	enough?  <i class="calibre3">Bastards. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	door,	Joe	Blankenship	shouted	into	a	megaphone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Citizens	of	Jefferson	County,	hear	me	speak.	Less	than	a	month	ago	my	wife was	murdered,	along	with	several	others,	by	federal	agents	claiming	we	were terrorists,	we	were	unpatriotic.	Now,	the	man	who	stood	up	for	us	and	spoke	out for	us	is	in	jail.	Why?	Because	he	was	foolish	enough	to	speak	out	loud,	and	try to	stand	in	front	of	a	crowd	and	tell	us	what	he	thought.	Is	this	the	America	you</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>want?	Is	this	the	America	you	believe	in?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!”	the	crowd	shouted	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know,	it	was	right	there,	at	the	courthouse	on	the	corner,	that	the	miners from	the	Blair	Mountain	rebellion	were	tried	for	treason.	Sixty	years	before	Blair Mountain,	old	John	Brown	was	tried	for	treason	in	that	very	building,	after trying	to	free	slaves	in	Virginia.	He	was	fighting	against	tyranny.	The	miners were	tried	and	some	hanged	because	they	fought	against	tyranny.	Because	they asked	for	the	right	to	speak	for	themselves,	to	vote	the	way	they	wanted,	to	live their	lives	not	under	the	thumbs	of	rich	men	with	guns.	And	you	know	who	came out	to	fight	against	them?	You	know	who	came	out	to	defend	the	gun-thugs	and the	dictator	of	Logan	County?	The	United	States	Army,	that’s	who.	The	very same	federal	government	that	murdered	my	wife	last	month.	The	very	same	men who	stand	across	the	street	in	their	black	coats,	taking	pictures	of	you	right now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blankenship	pointed	his	finger	at	the	two	men	across	the	street.	“That’s	right, I’m	talking	to	you.	Murderers!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	crowd	murmured,	a	dangerous	tone,	and	the	two	men	backed	toward	their car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	worry	about	them,	they’ll	get	theirs,	one	way	or	another.”	Blankenship said.	“Today	we’re	here	for	one	reason.	Dale	Whitt	was	assaulted	by	a	sheriff’s deputy	and	thrown	in	jail,	for	nothing	more	than	speaking	out.	It’s unconstitutional,	and	it’s	wrong.	I	won’t	stand	for	it.	Will	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Free	Dale	Whitt!”	Blankenship	cried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	crowd	responded	with	the	chant.	Karen	was	crowded	in	now;	more	and more	people	were	packed	onto	the	slippery	sidewalk,	possibly	two	or	three hundred,	the	rest	blocking	half	the	street.	She	brushed	the	rain	off	her	face	and stared	up	at	the	steps	of	the	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	ripple	moved	through	the	crowd,	and	Karen	saw	a	man	in	a	black	raincoat walk	up	next	to	Blankenship.	Sheriff	Watson.	He	took	the	megaphone	from Blankenship	and	held	it	to	his	lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a>“All	right,	all	right,	everybody	pipe	down	a	second	and	listen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom	Watson	was	popular	in	the	county,	and	even	in	this	circumstance	the	crowd listened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Folks,	I	know	what	happened.	Here’s	the	deal:	Deputy	Machen	has	been suspended	until	we	can	complete	our	investigation,	and	all	charges	have	been dropped	against	Mr.	Whitt.	He’ll	be	released	in	a	matter	of	minutes.	All	I	can	say is	I	didn’t	know	Machen	had	done	this,	but	I	accept	full	responsibility.	First	I learned	of	the	arrests,	unfortunately,	was	when	I	was	called	at	home	about	an hour	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	crowd	broke	into	loud	cheers	and	applause.	Karen	clapped	too,	elated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,”	Watson	said.	“As	soon	as	Mr.	Whitt	comes	out,	let	him	say	his	piece, and	then	I’m	going	to	have	to	ask	you	to	move	on,	because	you’re	blocking traffic	and	it	is	Monday	morning,	all	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	crowd	cheered	even	louder,	until,	five	minutes	later	Dale	Whitt	walked	out to	the	front	steps	of	the	jail.	His	eyes	widened	when	he	saw	the	crowd,	and	even more	so	when	the	loud	cheer	reached	a	crescendo.	Someone	in	the	back	of	the crowd	began	chanting	his	name,	and	the	crowd	picked	it	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	television	cameramen	scrambled	unsuccessfully	to	get	around	the	crowd and	talk	to	Whitt.	They	held	their	cameras	high	over	the	heads	of	the	crowd	to get	a	shot.	The	lights	glared	in	Karen’s	eyes,	and	she	shifted	her	position	next	to the	wall,	squinting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blankenship	smiled	and	handed	the	megaphone	to	Whitt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	all	right.	Thank	you	so	much	everyone	for	supporting	me.	We’re going	to	win	this	thing,	you	hear?	We’re	going	to	win!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	crowd	continued	chanting	his	name,	and	Karen	realized	Whitt	had	become	a celebrity,	a	symbol	for	all	the	pain	and	anger	these	people	experienced.	It	wasn’t just	about	Saturn	and	the	plant.	It	was	about	every	time	they	looked	at	their paychecks	and	saw	the	federal	government	had	taken	half;	every	time	they looked	at	the	crumbling	high	school	and	the	potholed	roads,	every	time	they	sent their	sons	and	daughters	off	to	fight	wars	halfway	around	the	world	for	vaguely defined	principles	that	always	seemed	to	come	down	to	the	corporate	good,	not</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a>the	common	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	it.	Damn	the	consequences,	she	was	going	to	throw	her	support	behind Whitt. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As	the	newest	member	of	Harpers	Ferry’s	small	police	force,	Antoine	Jackson’s most	frequent	contribution	to	law	and	order	was	writing	traffic	tickets.	But	with Sergeant	Teags	out	sick	today,	and	Wilson	still	on	crutches	from	the	night	he	lost control	of	his	vehicle	in	the	rain	and	slid	into	a	ditch	up	in	Bolivar	Heights, Jackson	was	the	only	officer	available.	Jackson	suspected	Wilson	had	a	load	on when	he	crashed	his	patrol	car,	but	as	the	junior	officer	on	the	force,	there	were things	he	just	couldn’t	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	result	was	that	he	was	to	be	the	“ride-along”	for	a	federal	bust	this	morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	agent	from	the	DHS	said,	he	was	here	merely	to	observe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	assistance	will	not	be	necessary.	This	is	a	federal	investigation,	not	local. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’ve	been	invited	as	a	professional	courtesy	only.	We’re	arresting	a	suspect	in one	hour,	one	Mark	Wheatley,	believed	to	be	a	dangerous	anti-government terrorist.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	DHS	agent	went	on.	The	suspect	was	under	surveillance,	on	his	way	to	work as	a	volunteer	for	Dale	Whitt’s	senatorial	campaign.	Expected	to	be	armed	and dangerous.	The	DHS	has	the	operation	well	in	hand,	thank	you,	but	we’d	like	an officer	from	your	department	to	be	present	for	the	proceedings.	But	only	as	a professional	courtesy,	you	understand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jackson	understood	he	was	wanted	here	about	as	much	as	an	IRS	agent	on	April 15.	The	requirement	for	a	local	“ride-along”	had	come	from	Washington	after	a series	of	botched	arrests	and	the	violence	at	the	Saturn	plant	in	Highview	at	the end	of	May.	The	county	prosecutor	had	subpoenaed	some	of	the	agents,	and	that had	tied	them	the	courts	for	weeks.	Even	though	DHS	won	their	appeal,	they were	trying	to	play	a	little	softer	now.	So	here	he	sat,	in	an	unmarked	car	in	the alley.	It	was	only	9:00	in	the	morning,	but	the	August	sun	glared	in	the	curved glass	windows.	Perversely,	the	DHS	agent	who	had	retrieved	him,	Richard Whitcomb,	kept	the	windows	raised.	Whitcomb	wore	a	flak	vest,	and	a	helmet with	a	plastic	shield	rested	on	the	seat	beside	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	think	you	can	maybe	lower	the	windows	a	little?	Or	run	the	air</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a>conditioning?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitcomb	glanced	at	him	with	contempt,	then	looked	back	out	the	window without	a	word.	They	waited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Though	they	lived	in	the	same	small	town,	no	more	than	two	miles	apart,	Dale Whitt	had	never	met	Karen	Greenfield.	Now	that	he	had,	he	was	enchanted	by her.	She	was	an	extremely	intelligent	woman,	assertive,	and	quite	attractive.	She was	also	half	his	age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Romance	had	never	worked	out	for	Whitt	anyway.	He’d	been	married	once,	but Sarah	had	long	since	divorced	him	and	moved	to	California	with	a	new	husband. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	as	well.	Didn’t	mean	he	couldn’t	think	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	me	about	this	Blair	Mountain	rebellion,”	she	said.	“I	keep	hearing	about	it from	you	guys,	I	don’t	know	the	story.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sat	across	the	desk	from	him	in	his	new	campaign	office	in	Harpers	Ferry,	a grey,	dark	office	in	a	second-floor	walkup	above	a	day	care	center.	The hardwood	floors	were	scuffed	and	scratched	and	had	been	painted	grey	by	a previous	tenant.	The	office	seemed	quiet—a	few	volunteers	were	working	at computers	or	talking	on	the	phone,	but	the	level	of	activity	they’d	had	just	a	few weeks	before	was	diminished.	Whitt	looked	into	Karen’s	eyes	and	wished	he were	twenty	years	younger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	about	a	century	ago	down	in	Logan	County	a	man	named	Don	Chafin	ran the	county.	They	used	to	call	it	the	‘Kingdom	of	Logan.’	He	ran	the	county,	ran the	polls,	manipulated	elections	through	violence.	Back	then	you	couldn’t	even get	into	the	county	except	by	rail,	and	he’d	have	his	men	at	every	rail	station, and	they	would	stop	and	interrogate	anyone	who	came	into	the	county.	He	was mean	as	a	snake,	and	he	had	three	hundred	paid	gunmen.	It	was	brutal	for	the miners.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	volunteers,	Mark	Wheatley,	approached,	holding	a	chart	with	a	pie graph. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry	to	interrupt,	just	had	a	quick	question.	Is	this	what	you	were	looking	for?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a>Whitt	examined	the	paper.	“That	looks	perfect.	Thanks,	Mark.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	problem,”	Mark	said,	and	walked	back	to	his	desk.	He	was	quiet,	but	a workhorse,	and	had	handled	most	of	the	computer	presentation	work	for	the	last several	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mark’s	been	with	the	campaign	for	about	a	week,”	he	said	to	Karen.	“Sharp kid,	from	down	near	Baughman	Settlement	and	Front	Royal.	Anyway,	all through	1920	and	‘21,	there	were	bloody	strikes	and	battles	all	over	the	state, particularly	down	there	in	Logan	and	Mingo.	The	miners	were	mostly	homeless during	that	time,	thrown	out	of	their	camps;	whole	families,	thousands	of	them, lived	in	tents.	Some	bloody	shootouts	happened—in	fact,	there	was	a	massacre down	there	in	‘20	or	‘21,	and	the	governor	announced	martial	law	in	Mingo County.	In	the	summer	of	‘21	an	army	of	about	5,000	men	marched	on	Logan County.	Their	goal	was	to	throw	out	Chafin—or	hang	him—and	unionize	the mine.	Two	or	three	bloody	battles—no	one	knows	how	many	people	were	killed</p>
<p class="calibre1">—and	the	Army	was	called	in	to	deal	with	it.	The	miners	were	tried	for	murder and	treason.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow,”	she	said.	“I’ve	got	some	reading	to	do.	I’d	heard	a	little	about	it,	but	not much.	I	didn’t	realize	it	was	so…	well,	large	scale.”	She	looked	at	her	watch.	“I appreciate	the	history	lesson…	and	here	I	am,	supposed	to	be	volunteering	for you,	keeping	you	tied	up.	I’ll	get	going,	and	get	these	flyers	out	this	afternoon.	I have	a	job	interview	this	morning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	good	luck,	and	thanks,	Karen.	It’s	been	a	pleasure	having	you	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	flashed	him	a	winning	smile	and	stood	up.	Waving	to	the	others	in	the office,	she	walked	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	pulled	a	sheet	of	paper	from	his	desk.	Back	to	cold	calling	potential	major supporters.	Talking	to	a	beautiful	young	redhead	was	much	more	pleasant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	been	sitting	at	his	desk	all	day	yesterday,	calling	a	list	of	potential supporters	to	ask	for	their	support	and	their	donations.	Cold	calling	was discouraging	work	under	the	best	of	circumstances.	The	surroundings	did	not help;	the	office	was	dingy,	the	windows	were	dirty,	and	it	was	time	to	do something	to	reenergize	his	campaign. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	needed	to	motivate	people—both	the	volunteers	and	the	donors.	In	the	initial</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a>anger	after	the	incident	at	the	Saturn	plant,	folks	were	outraged	and	gave	freely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	first	four	weeks	of	his	campaign	were	exhilarating:	large	rallies	all	over	the state,	with	tremendous	response.	As	more	time	went	by—almost	three	months now—the	outrage	waned.	The	DHS	wasn’t	in	the	news	any	more,	and	Whitt	had difficulty	getting	coverage	as	a	third	party	candidate.	He	still	had	many supporters,	but	they	weren’t	winning	over	converts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Highview	had	just	about	dried	up	and	blown	away	the	way	Tim	Wagner	had	said it	would	in	the	last	three	months,	as	trucks	came	through,	carting	away	all	the property	from	the	now	empty	plant.	No	one	seemed	to	care.	It	was	hard	to	tell how	many	people	had	left	town—unemployment	checks	still	came	in	for	most	of the	workers,	and	most	wouldn’t	leave	until	those	checks	stopped	coming,	if	then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	what	could	he	do?	It	was	sad	that	it	took	some	monumentally	stupid	act	by the	federal	government	to	get	people	to	look	beyond	their	personal circumstances.	Or	maybe	it	was	the	opposite:	it	took	making	those	stupid	acts personal	for	it	to	interest	people.	Well,	if	he	knew	the	federal	government,	it	was a	matter	of	time	before	they	would	provide	the	motivation	he	needed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">One	thing	at	a	time.	It	doesn’t	pay	to	get	sidetracked. </i>	Right	now	it	was	time	to focus	on	running	his	campaign,	which	meant	more	phone	calls.	He	picked	up	the phone	and	dialed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	loud	bang	on	the	front	door	interrupted	him,	and	he	looked	up	from	the	phone startled.	One	of	the	volunteers	nearly	jumped	out	of	her	seat.	Door	wasn’t locked;	who	the	hell	would	bang	on	it	like	that? </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	back	door	of	the	building	opened	and	Officer	Jackson	sat	up.	A	young redhaired	woman	walked	down	the	alley	and	unlocked	a	car.	Antoine	studied	her face.	She	looked	familiar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	I	know	her,”	Antoine	said.	“The	redhead.	She	worked	at	the	Saturn	plant</p>
<p class="calibre1">—filed	a	complaint	against	you	guys	after	the	raid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitcomb	glanced	over	at	him,	then	lifted	his	camera	and	shot	several	pictures of	her	as	she	got	into	her	car.	She	backed	up,	then	drove	out	of	the	alley	and turned	down	the	street. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a>“Remember	her	name?”	Whitcomb	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	it	was	Greenfield.	Karen	Greenfield.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	drop	of	sweat	rolled	down	Jackson’s	forehead.  <i class="calibre3">Arrogant	DHS	agents. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Five	more	minutes	passed	in	silence.	Jackson	shifted	in	his	seat	as	sweat dampened	the	back	of	his	neck,	and	he	told	himself	that	if	God	wanted	him	to	be cool,	he	would	have	been	born	with	an	air	conditioner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	units,	we	go	in	thirty	seconds.	Countdown.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jackson	and	the	DHS	Agent,	Whitcomb,	reached	for	their	door	handles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Positions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doors	opened.	Jackson	followed	Whitcomb	and	they	met	two	other	agents	who had	just	exited	their	own	vehicle	at	the	back	door	of	the	building.	More	prepared to	enter	the	front	door,	and	two	were	even	now	entering	the	High	Street	Day Care	to	evacuate	the	kids	if	it	became	necessary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	order	came	over	the	radio:	“Go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitcomb	opened	the	door	and	the	three	agents	burst	upstairs,	Jackson following.	At	the	door	on	the	second	floor,	they	paused	and	waited	to	hear	the other	agents	pound	on	the	front	door.	As	soon	as	the	sound	came,	two	agents forced	open	the	back	door	and	they	charged	in,	weapons	ready. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	happened	too	quickly	for	Jackson	to	follow.	In	one	corner,	an	agent	yelled</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get	on	the	floor,	get	on	the	floor!”	to	the	terrified	volunteers.	At	the	opposite side	of	the	room,	two	more	agents	grabbed	Dale	Whitt.	Jackson	recognized	him from	television.	Agents	ran	everywhere	brandishing	weapons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	that	was	when	everything	went	all	to	hell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	sound	of	the	pounding	on	the	office	door,	Mark	Wheatley,	the	new volunteer,	ran	for	the	bathroom.	Whitt	watched	him	go,	puzzled,	then	turned, shocked	as	armed	men	burst	into	the	room,	weapons	raised,	shouting	“Federal</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a>agents.	Get	on	the	floor,	now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	jumped	to	his	feet	and	found	himself	flanked	by	two	men	in	black	body armor.	“Get	on	the	floor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	got	down	on	his	knees	and	started	to	lie	down	on	the	floor	when	he remembered	Mark,	who	had	run	for	the	bathroom	as	the	agents	arrived.	What	the hell	was	he	doing?	The	bathroom	door	opened	and	a	small	olive	green	cylinder rolled	out	to	the	middle	of	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Run!”	shouted	an	agent.	“Grenade!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	thermite	grenade	ignited	with	a	roar	and	bathed	the	room	in	intense	white light.	Whitt	ignored	the	agents	as	he	jumped	up	and	ran	for	the	door,	slapping	at burning	hair	on	his	head	as	he	ran.	He	heard	gunshots	behind	him,	didn’t	know	if they	were	aimed	at	him.	At	that	point	he	didn’t	care. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Officer	Jackson	felt	the	blast	of	heat	through	the	back	doorway	as	the	grenade went	off.	The	floor	caught	fire,	along	with	a	volunteer,	who	shrieked.	He	also caught	a	good	view	of	the	son	of	a	bitch	who’d	thrown	the	grenade.	Instinctively, Jackson	raised	his	service	weapon,	a	9mm	Beretta.	He	paused	to	breathe,	and then	fired	three	rounds	through	the	door	of	the	bathroom.	The	room	was	a conflagration,	and	Dale	Whitt,	the	remaining	agents,	and	volunteers	all	fled except	one	volunteer	who	rolled,	screaming	and	burning,	in	the	middle	of	the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jackson	was	forced	back	by	the	intense	heat.	The	thermite	grenade,	still	shining like	a	white-hot	road	flare,	had	burned	a	tight	orange-white	circle	into	the floorboards.	A	fraction	of	a	second	later,	the	hole	burned	all	the	way	through	and the	grenade	fell,	out	of	sight.	Into	the	day	care	center	down	below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jackson	howled	as	he	ran	down	the	back	stairs,	two	at	a	time,	racing	for	the	day care	entrance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Dale	Whitt	reached	the	ground	floor	he	saw	the	DHS	team	already evacuating	the	day	care.	The	entrance	was	a	logjam,	with	DHS	agents	all	over</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a>the	place,	screaming	children	streaming	out	of	the	day	care.	Other	agents	were trying	to	get	back	into	the	building,	and	now	smoke	poured	out	of	the	second floor	windows.	In	the	chaos,	he’d	lost	his	two	handlers.	Whatever	the	agents	had planned,	they’d	clearly	bungled	it.	Had	they	evacuated	the	kids? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	to	the	day	care	at	the	bottom	of	the	stairs	that	led	to	his	office	stood open.	Whitt	pushed	past	two	agents,	went	inside	and	shouted,	“Is	anyone	still	in here?	Hello?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	response.	He	ran	through	the	room;	no	one	was	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	way	back	to	the	front	door,	he	saw	the	darkening	spot	in	the	ceiling.	The grenade	burning	through.	Without	a	word,	he	ran	for	the	entrance	as	the	grenade fell	through	the	ceiling	and	ignited	the	carpet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	agent	nearly	shot	him	as	he	burst	out	the	now	cleared	front	door,	covered	in smoke	and	soot.	One	of	them	shouted,	“DHS,	arms	up!	Get	over	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	complied—no	point	in	doing	anything	else.	As	he	reached	the	appointed location,	he	said,	“Someone	want	to	tell	me	just	what	the	hell	happened	in there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	agent,	his	face	covered	in	soot,	approached.	“Dale	Whitt?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	correct.	And	your	name?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Whitt,	I’m	Special	Agent	Aaron	Madison.	I’m	running	this	operation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	Agent	Madison,	you	really	screwed	up.	You’ve	got	a	whole	hell	of	a	lot of	explaining	to	do.	What	the	hell	was	this	about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	agent	responded	as	they	heard	the	first	sirens	from	approaching	fire	trucks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Whitt,	we	had	information	leading	us	to	believe	one	of	your	volunteers, Mark	Wheatley,	was	involved	in	a	terrorist	incident	within	the	borders	of	the United	States.	He	has	been	under	surveillance	for	some	time,	and	we	moved	this morning	to	place	him	under	arrest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	answered,	voice	cold.	“And	what	the	hell	were	you	thinking	doing	it	here? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Couldn’t	you	have	arrested	him	at	home,	or	on	the	street	or	something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a>Madison	shifted	on	his	feet.	“We	are	very	interested	in	your	connection	to	him, Mr.	Whitt.	We’d	like	you	to	answer	some	questions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	shout	interrupted	them,	as	one	of	the	agents	ran	up.	“Madison,	sir!	The	day care	teachers	just	did	a	headcount;	they’re	missing	one	of	the	children.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Madison	blanched	and	ran	away	from	Whitt.	“<i class="calibre3">Oh,	shit! </i>	Can	we	get	somebody	in there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Officer	Jackson	was	trying	to	figure	out	how	to	get	out.	After	seeing	the	grenade go	through	the	second	floor,	he	had	run	down	the	back	stairs,	then	slammed	open the	back	door	of	the	empty	day	care.	Doing	a	sweep	through	the	now	burning building,	he	found	a	four-year-old	girl	crouched	in	a	fetal	position,	screaming, against	the	wall	in	the	bathroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi,	honey.	I’m	Officer	Jackson,	I’m	a	police	officer.	We	need	to	leave	the building	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	kept	screaming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jackson	walked	to	her	and	picked	her	up,	gripping	her	by	the	arms	as	she struggled.	“Listen	to	me,	little	girl.	I’m	a	police	officer;	I’m	here	to	protect	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	have	to	leave	now.	Understand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded	frantically.	“Okay,”	she	whispered.	“I’m	scared.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	worry,	honey,	God	is	watching	out	for	us	both.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carrying	her,	he	walked	to	the	door,	which	had	closed	behind	him.	It	was	very hot	to	the	touch.	He	couldn’t	open	it.	The	only	window	was	a	tiny	thing	near	the ceiling,	about	thirty	inches	wide	and	maybe…	maybe	sixteen	inches	tall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only	one	thing	for	it.	He	walked	to	the	wall	and	stood	on	top	of	the	radiator, trying	to	open	the	window.	It	was	coated	with	many,	many	years	of	old	paint.	He took	out	his	baton,	and	hit	the	window,	hard.	It	shattered.	He	scattered	most	of the	glass	away	from	the	window,	and	shouted,	“Hey,	anyone	out	there?	Anyone out	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a>He	heard	shouts	outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen	up.	This	is	Officer	Jackson,	I’m	passing	a	little	girl	out.	She’s	coming	out right	now.	Help	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	glanced	back	at	the	door,	sweat	dripping	from	his	face.	The	door	changed colors	before	his	eyes,	the	paint	darkening,	swelling.	He	could	hear	a	fierce	roar outside	the	door	as	the	fire	consumed	the	main	floor	area	of	the	day	care. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	picked	up	the	girl	again;	they	were	both	slick	with	sweat	in	the	intense	heat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	your	name?”	At	first	his	voice	rasped	from	the	smoke,	then	cleared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Melissa.”	She	quivered	in	his	arms,	and	he	almost	dropped	her.	He	glanced back	at	the	door,	black	now,	the	paint	peeling	off	and	flaking	to	the	floor.	Black smoke	poured	in	around	the	edges.	Oh	Jesus,	he	wasn’t	going	to	make	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Melissa,	I’m	going	to	pass	you	through	the	window	to	the	folks	out	there.	I want	you	to	listen	up	to	whatever	they	say,	got	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Got	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	watch	the	glass.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	lifted	her	to	the	window,	and	a	prayer	coursed	from	his	lips.	His	eyes	watered from	the	smoke	and	sweat	stung	his	eyes;	he	had	to	blink	to	see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	heard	more	shouts	outside.	“There	she	is,”	someone	said,	and	then	he	felt	her weight	lifting	from	his	hands.  <i class="calibre3">Thank	God,	at	least	she	was	safe. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	was	now	shrouded	in	smoke.	Heart	pounding	in	his	chest,	he	jumped on	the	radiator	and	grabbed	the	edge	of	the	window	sill,	slicing	open	his	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind	him,	the	flames	roared	as	the	door	burst. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	reached	the	corner	of	the	building	a	step	behind	Agent	Madison,	just	as the	little	girl	was	pulled	free.	The	fire	trucks	roared	up	the	street	behind	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	hands	gripped	the	edge	of	the	windowsill,	and	a	police	officer	got	his	head</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a>and	shoulders	through.	Two	DHS	agents	ran	to	him	as	he	struggled	to	boost himself	through	the	tiny	window.	Then	he	disappeared,	replaced	by	flame	that burst	out	the	window.	The	agents	jerked	back,	one	of	them	shouting	in	pain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	cringed	when	he	heard	the	officer	scream.	Then	the	screaming	turned	into an	animal	howl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get	back	from	the	building,”	shouted	a	fireman	who	came	running	up	the	alley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	somebody	in	there,	in	that	room,”	shouted	Whitt.	“A	police	officer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	got	it.	Now	get	back,	get	back.”	He	turned	away	from	them	and	spoke	into	a radio.	Whitt	backed	away,	and	so	did	the	DHS	agents.	Several	more	firemen	ran around	the	corner,	and	he	watched	as	they	took	to	the	wall	with	axes,	but	it	was too	late.	No	one	could	be	alive	in	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Five	hours	later,	Whitt	sat	in	the	field	office	of	the	DHS,	after	interviews	with	a team	of	agents.	In	direct	contrast	to	his	own	dirty,	now	nonexistent	office,	this small	field	office	was	well	appointed,	with	fresh	paint	and	an	expansive	view	of the	confluence	of	the	Potomac	and	Shenandoah	rivers	a	mile	away.	Sitting	at	a highly	polished	desk,	drinking	fresh	coffee,	Whitt	waited	to	find	out	just	when the	hell	he	was	going	to	be	allowed	to	go	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	questioners	turned	him	over	to	the	Special	Agent	in	Charge	of	the	Harpers Ferry	field	office,	Justin	Hagarty,	after	their	interrogation	ended. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	stereotype	of	a	DHS	agent	was	a	well-built	white	male,	tanned,	with	dark sunglasses.	Hagarty	was	short,	balding,	and	looked	more	like	an	accountant	than an	antiterrorist	agent.	All	the	same,	there	was	a	conspicuous	bulge	under	his navy	blue	blazer,	and	the	other	agents	treated	him	with	a	level	of	deference Whitt	found	surprising. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty	said	Whitt	was	not	under	arrest;	he	was	merely	being	detained	for questioning.	When	asked	how	long	he	would	be	so	detained,	Hagarty	did	not respond.	Instead,	he	put	on	a	pair	of	reading	glasses,	opened	his	desk	and	began shuffling	through	paperwork.	Whitt’s	eyes	narrowed.	It	was	a	game,	one	Whitt did	not	feel	like	playing.	He	didn’t	care	how	long	Hagarty	could	make	him	wait. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	game	simply	proved	what	Whitt	already	knew:	the	man	was	drunk	on	his own	power.	After	a	moment	looking	through	the	papers,	Hagarty	picked	up	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a>phone	and	dialed.  <i class="calibre3">Screw	him. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	room	was	small,	but	did	not	feel	cramped,	with	the	view	of	the	river	valley on	one	side.	The	floor	was	carpeted,	the	furniture	expensive.	It	did	not	feel	like	a police	station	or	a	government	office	to	Whitt.	More	like	the	offices	of	a	high-flying	corporation.	So	this	is	where	all	the	tax	money	was	going. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	long	wait,	Hagarty	finished	his	phone	call,	looked	up	from	his	papers	and removed	his	reading	glasses.	He	folded	them	and	placed	them	in	a	leather	case that	he	put	in	his	coat	pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Whitt,	first	of	all	I	want	you	understand	you	are	not	under	arrest,	nor	are you	in	any	way	a	suspect	in	any	investigation	we	are	conducting.	You	can choose	to	get	up	and	walk	out	of	here	right	now.	However,	I’d	like	to	talk	with you,	if	you	are	willing	to	be	cooperative.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	have	the	right	to	remain	silent,	or	to	speak	to	an	attorney.	As	I	said,	you can	get	up	and	walk	out	of	here	right	now	if	you	so	choose.	If	we	genuinely suspected	you	were	involved	in	terrorist	activities,	we	have	the	authority	to	hold you	up	to	a	year	while	we	investigate.	However,	at	this	time	the	attorney	general has	not	made	that	determination.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	get	it,	although	you	know	as	well	as	I	do	holding	anyone	for	a	year	without charges	is	unconstitutional.	Still,	I’m	happy	to	cooperate,	but	I	want	an explanation	from	you.	Your	men	killed	one	of	my	people	this	morning,	and	you are	very	lucky	none	of	those	kids	got	hurt	today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	if	your	volunteer	Mark	Wheatley	hadn’t	been	carrying	explosives,	we wouldn’t	have	had	that	problem	now,	would	we?	He	was	the	murderer	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	what	we’d	like	to	discuss	with	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	said	something	about	him	being	involved	with	a	terrorist	incident.	Are	you saying	he	was	responsible	for	that	thing	in	Arlington	in	May?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t	say,	but	I’m	going	to	be	straight	with	you,	Mr.	Whitt—you	seem	to	be	a straight	shooter	yourself.	It’s	my	job	to	protect	our	country	from	people	like Wheatley,	from	terrorists,	whether	foreign	or	domestic.	Understand	that	first.	I’m not	here	to	harass	you.	I’m	here	for	your	safety.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>“That’s	why	I’ve	spent	the	last	several	hours	being	questioned.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty	ignored	the	comment.	“Now,	since	May	we’ve	been	investigating	this bombing	in	Arlington.	The	bombing	got	in	under	the	wire—we	didn’t	even	have a	whisper	about	it	beforehand.	However,	as	you	know	we	recently	made	some arrests:	a	radical	anti-government	group	operating	out	of	the	mountains	of	West Virginia.	These	are	not	nice	people,	Mr.	Whitt.	Mr.	Wheatley	was	closely associated	with	some	of	them,	and	we	became	very	interested	when	he	showed up	in	Harpers	Ferry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	interrupted.	“You	know,	I’ve	been	curious	about	that.	Did	you	know	I’ve been	down	to	Baughman	Settlement?	Did	you	know	I	know	some	of	those folks?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	did,	Mr.	Whitt,	which	makes	you	of	significant	interest	to	us.	Even	more	so, with	Wheatley	dead.	How	long	had	he	been	volunteering	for	your	campaign?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	a	week,	actually.	Most	of	the	new	volunteers	had	pretty	much	dried	up about	three,	four	weeks	ago.	He	was	an	exception—started	last	Monday.	Just strolled	in,	said	he	wanted	to	volunteer,	he	was	between	jobs.	Lot	of	folks	in	that boat	right	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	skills	did	he	have?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	knew	his	way	around	a	computer.	We	had	him	doing	cold-calls,	asking	for contributions	and	supporters.	He	helped	put	together	some	flyers	and	such, nothing	too	complicated.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	why	did	he	volunteer	for	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	answered,	somewhat	defensively.	“I	had	to	assume	he	shared	my	political views	about	the	future	of	West	Virginia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty	looked	at	Whitt,	his	face	impassive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	you	just	briefly	outline	those?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	you	know	the	answer	to	that,”	Whitt	responded,	bristling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	me	make	sure	I	understand	them.	You	advocate	amending	the	West	Virginia</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a>Constitution	such	that	the	state	could	become	an	independent	country.	Is	that correct?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	is	correct.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty	leaned	forward	with	a	deep	frown.	“You	know,	Whitt,	you	don’t	strike me	as	the	type	to	delude	yourself.	What	makes	you	think	anyone	would	go	for this	idea?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	leaned	close	to	him	and	responded.	“You	and	your	pals	are	the	reason	they will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty’s	lips	curled	up	in	an	unpleasant	smile.	“I’m	not	here	to	argue	with	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether	or	not	you	agree	with	our	methods,	I	can’t	address	that	right	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here’s	my	problem.	We’ve	had	a	number	of	indications	the	same	group	has additional	attacks	planned,	and	we’re	trying	to	wrap	them	up	before	that happens.	They	have	half	a	dozen	people	loose,	absolute	religious	fanatics,	and those	people	very	much	support	your	political	agenda.	But	they	aren’t	getting	out the	vote.	They’re	killing	people.	Get	the	picture?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,	Hagarty.	I	know	those	people.	They	aren’t	the	types	to	be	blowing	up buildings.	Hell,	I	couldn’t	get	them	interested	in	politics	at	all	when	I	was	down there—they	just	wanted	to	be	left	alone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty	leaned	back	in	his	chair.	“Maybe	they	just	didn’t	trust	you,	Mr.	Whitt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	do	have	a	reputation	as	a	loose	cannon.	We’ve	had	our	eyes	on	the	group	at Baughman	Settlement	for	a	while.	At	least	two	of	their	members	are	convicted felons;	both	were	involved	in	assaulting	a	US	park	policeman	on	the	National Mall	eight	years	ago	under	somewhat	bizarre	circumstances.	Circumstances	that led	us	to	put	them	on	our	potential	terrorist	watchlist.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	sneered.	“Am	I	supposed	to	be	impressed?	Nowadays	if	you	buy	the wrong	groceries	you	get	put	on	the	watchlist.	I	bet	I’m	in	your	database.	One week	I	bought	falafel	and	ammonia	and	chlorine	all	at	the	same	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	be	an	ass.	These	people	really	are	dangerous.	You	probably	heard	about the	park	policeman—apparently	something	in	his	mannerisms	caused	them	to think	he	was	homosexual.	They	tied	him	up	and	tortured	him.”	Hagarty	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	rolled	his	eyes.	“Yeah,	I	know	about	the	case.	It’s	hideous,	I	agree.	But	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a>couple	of	bizarre	crimes	doesn’t	justify	turning	into	a	police	state.	Don’t	you	get it,	Hagarty?	I’d	like	to	have	a	safe	society	too.	But	the	more	you	guys	tighten your	grip,	the	more	you	spy	on	people,	the	more	you	set	people	against	each other,	the	more	likely	you	make	it	so	people	will	lash	out.	Terrorism	doesn’t happen	in	a	vacuum,	it	happens	as	a	response	to	intolerable	conditions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty	spread	his	arms.	“What,	you	think	it’s	okay	to	blow	up	buildings?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hell,	no.	But	I’m	also	not	stupid	enough	to	think	people	do	that	sort	of	thing just	for	the	hell	of	it.	You	guys	are	creating	the	desperation.	Holy	Christ—you took	a	loyal,	hardworking	American	town	and	turned	them	into	a	town	of	people who	hate	the	federal	government.	Innocent	people	were	gunned	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some	of	my	agents	were	gunned	down	too,	Mr.	Whitt.	I	got	pictures	right	in	my desk.”	Hagarty	reached	into	his	drawer	and	slapped	a	photo	on	the	table.	“Here’s Charles	Dylan.	He	was	married,	two	kids.	Got	blown	away	by	some	redneck with	a	shotgun	at	that	plant	of	yours.	I	had	to	tell	his	wife	afterward,	and	hand her	a	flag	at	his	funeral.	Yes,	mistakes	were	made,	but	tell	me,	why	the	hell	did your	loyal	hardworking	Americans	go	to	work	carrying	shotguns?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	leaned	back	in	his	chair,	took	a	deep	breath	to	calm	down.	“Look,	Hagarty, when	I	look	for	who	did	something,	I	look	for	who	benefited	the	most.	And	you know	what?	The	way	I	see	it,	ever	since	Arlington,	the	DHS	is	getting	new powers,	more	free	reign.	Nobody	even	questions	the	fact	that	you	guys	rounded up	hundreds	of	American	citizens	after	the	bombing—for	‘questioning’—and didn’t	allow	them	access	to	attorneys.	Now	Congress	is	talking	about	a	new	bill to	make	DHS	even	more	powerful.	Give	me	a	break.	If	I	wanted	to	look	for	a smoking	gun,	I’d	look	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty	stood	up,	face	red,	and	stepped	back	from	the	table.	“I’m	not	going	to debate	with	you.	I’ve	got	a	war	to	fight,	and	you	don’t	fight	wars	by	screwing around.	I	go	home	every	night	wondering	if	we	go	too	far,	if	we	harm	the Constitution.	But	I’ll	tell	you	what,	the	Constitution	isn’t	a	suicide	pact.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	wrong,	Hagarty.	That’s	exactly	what	it	is.	It’s	real	Americans	saying they’d	rather	die	than	give	up	liberty.	That’s	what	the	Constitution	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty	stood	at	the	window,	looking	out,	shoulders	slumped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Whitt,	you	are	free	to	go.	We’ll	call	later	this	week	with	more	questions, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a>most	likely.	Please	keep	yourself	available.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sun	had	nearly	set	when	Whitt	walked	out	of	the	building.	As	he	approached the	glass	doors	of	the	exit,	he	was	surprised	to	find	bright	lights	and	a	knot	of reporters.	He	stepped	out	and	they	clamored	to	get	the	first	question	in,	shoving microphones	in	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Whitt,	the	DHS	says	you	are	not	a	suspect	in	the	Arlington	bombing.	Can you	make	any	comments	about	the	incident	today?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	certainly	can,”	he	answered.	“Today	is	a	perfect	example	of	why	West Virginia	must	be	shed	of	the	federal	government.	The	DHS	came	into	the	office of	a	political	campaign	today	with	weapons	drawn.	Instead	of	making	their	arrest at	the	suspect’s	home,	or	on	the	street,	they	chose	to	do	so	in	an	extremely dangerous	situation.	They	killed	one	of	my	staffers	and	endangered	the	lives	of twenty	children	in	the	day	care	in	our	building.	One	of	our	brave	police	officers gave	up	his	life	to	save	the	life	of	one	of	those	children.	As	always,	the	federal government	has	shown	a	callous	disregard	for	state’	rights	and	the	safety	of citizens,	and	disrespect	for	local	law	enforcement.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	the	DHS	ask	you	about	the	Arlington	bombing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	ma’am.	I	wouldn’t	have	any	information	for	them.	They	wanted	to	know about	a	volunteer,	a	man	who	showed	up	at	our	office	just	a	week	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	there	is	no	connection	between	your	organization	and	the	Arlington bombing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	not.	Good	God,	those	people,	whoever	they	are,	killed	civilians. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	what	we’re	trying	to	get	away	from,	is	the	feds	coming	in	and	hurting	our people.	That	police	officer,	and	the	children	in	the	day	care,	and	my	co-workers and	volunteers—_they_	are	the	victims	here,	caught	in	the	crossfire	between	a mass	murderer	on	the	one	side	and	an	overbearing	federal	government	on	the other.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will	you	continue	your	campaign	to	have	West	Virginia	secede	from	the	United States?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a>“Absolutely.	You	know,	when	the	United	States	was	founded	there	were	less people	in	the	entire	country	than	there	are	in	West	Virginia	today.	Democracy	on this	scale	doesn’t	work	any	more.	Not	when	the	automatic	response	of	the federal	government	is	to	shoot	first	and	ask	questions	later.	Not	when	our	basic, fundamental	freedoms	are	trampled	on.	Not	when	the	government	takes	out	far more	in	taxes	than	it	gives	back	in	services.	And	especially	not	when	the government	protects	the	very	corporations	that	own	and	exploit	ninety	percent	of the	land	in	West	Virginia	while	taking	all	the	wealth	out	to	New	York	and	Los Angeles.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	reporter	jumped	in,	one	he	recognized:	Maria	Chase	from	the Charleston	Gazette.	Her	articles	had	tended	to	be	sympathetic	to	his	campaign	to date.	“Mr.	Whitt,	were	the	petitions	for	the	ballot	initiative	located	in	your headquarters?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	caught	a	breath,	stopped	short.	“Yes,	ma’am,	they	were.	We’re	going	to have	to	start	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	only	got	a	month	to	get	the	required	signatures.	Will	that	be	long enough?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	will,	of	course,	press	for	an	extension	under	the	circumstances.	But	it	will have	to	be	enough.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">How	the	news	reported	the	events	of	the	day	depended	a	great	deal	on	where	the reader	or	viewer	was.	In	many	ways,	the	reporting	showed	the	growing	gap	in political	beliefs	among	the	editors	rather	than	a	divergence	in	the	news. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	example,	the	evenings	news	out	of	Harpers	Ferry’s	NBC	affiliate	opened with	the	statement,	“A	rookie	police	officer	and	college	intern	were	killed	in	a bungled	DHS	raid	today,”	then	proceeded	to	give	an	account	of	the	events.	The camera	lingered	several	seconds	on	the	late	officer’s	fiancée	as	she	described their	wedding	plans,	now	cancelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	Washington,	DC,	Channel	9	News	opened	with,	“A	suspected	mass	murderer was	cornered	today	in	Harpers	Ferry,	West	Virginia,	where	he	was	killed	in	a	gun battle	with	the	DHS.	More	news	at	eleven.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p163"></a>The	Charleston	Gazette,	West	Virginia’s	biggest	daily	newspaper,	ran	coverage sympathetic	to	Dale	Whitt’s	campaign	and	the	family	of	the	slain	officer,	and excoriated	the	DHS	for	needlessly	endangering	the	lives	of	children.	The	one-inch	black	headline	on	the	front	page	read,	“Officer	killed	saving	child	during DHS	assault.”	A	second	article,	also	above	the	fold,	said,	“Petition	signatures destroyed	by	DHS;	Whitt	reopens	campaign	for	West	Virginia	Independence.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	DHS	had	provided	just	what	Whitt	needed.	His	movement	had	now	become mainstream. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p164"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	Fourteen</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">August	15</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A	grey	squirrel	perched,	swaying	on	a	branch,	not	far	outside	Ken	Murphy’s window.	It	looked	around,	alert,	then	ran	down	the	branch	and	disappeared, leaving	behind	an	unbroken	view	of	trees.	In	a	few	more	weeks,	they	would begin	changing	color,	with	the	slow	transition	to	another	cold	winter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Summer	had	almost	ended,	and	Murphy	had	been	out	of	work	for	three	months. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Money	wouldn’t	last	much	longer	either,	though	the	cash	from	selling	Martha’s flower	shop	would	help	him	hold	the	line	through	the	fall.	He’d	made	ten	cold calls	this	afternoon,	after	a	frustrating	morning	interviewing	with	a	defense contractor	in	McLean,	Virginia.	It	was	a	long	hike	from	Highview,	but	a	job	was a	job.	The	manager	who	interviewed	him	was	younger	than	Valerie	and	had dismissed	Murphy’s	three	decades	of	work	experience	as	irrelevant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stared	out	the	window	at	the	evening	twilight,	eyes	unfocused,	his	thoughts on	the	summer	he	and	Tom	found	the	holed	boat	in	Peachtree	Creek.	Murphy was	sixteen,	his	little	brother	six,	the	same	age	as	Kenny.	The	creek	was sluggish,	swollen	from	rain,	the	air	thick	with	mosquitoes.	The	summer	had	been sweltering,	and	some	time	in	cool	water	seemed	to	be	just	the	thing.	He’d	swum out	and	flipped	the	boat	over	after	a	struggle	to	get	it	out	of	the	mud,	then	lifted Tommy	over	the	side	and	climbed	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	had	screamed	and	laughed	excitedly	as	water	started	to	pour	in	through the	softball-sized	hole	in	the	bottom.	The	boat	sank	before	they’d	floated	more than	fifty	yards,	and	they	swam	ashore	and	lay	there	in	the	sun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thirty	years	gone,	and	he	still	remembered	his	mother’s	biting	lecture.	Ten	years older	than	his	brother,	and	he’d	risked	that	little	boy’s	life—and	lost	one	of Tommy’s	shoes	in	the	bargain.	It	had	been	worth	every	minute	of	the	lecture; they	hadn’t	had	so	much	fun	all	summer.	Tommy	still	remembered	it	too;	it	was one	of	his	earliest	memories. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	hard	to	believe	the	hardcore	commander	of	the	First	Brigade,	101st Infantry	had	once	been	a	laughing	little	guy	who	screamed	and	cheered	as	their boat	sank	in	the	muddy	water.	Christ,	his	blonde	hair	had	turned	grey,	his	face</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p165"></a>careworn	and	rough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where	did	the	time	go? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	scream	jerked	Murphy	back	to	the	present. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Daddy!”	The	word	trailed	off	into	a	wail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	ran	to	Kenny’s	bedroom.	Kenny	lay	curled	up	in	a	fetal	position	on	the floor,	plastic	army	men	scattered	on	the	floor	around	him.	His	arms	and	legs twitched	uncontrollably,	knocking	the	plastic	men	about	on	the	floor.	His	face was	white,	eyes	wide	and	terrified.	Tears	ran	down	the	boy’s	face	as	he	clutched at	his	left	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	gathered	his	shaking	son	into	his	arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Daddy,	it	hurts,	it	really	hurts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	cried	out	again,	jackknifed	almost	double. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	held	onto	him	and	whispered	urgently,	“I	got	you,	little	guy,	I	got	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’ll	be	all	right.	We’re	just	going	to	take	a	trip	back	to	the	hospital,	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kenny	shook,	and	a	moan	escaped	his	lips.	“Why	don’t	it	stop,	Daddy?	Please, make	it	stop.	Please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	face	turned	even	more	pale,	and	sweat	ran	down	his	forehead	in	tiny	rivulets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	stopped	a	sob.	“I’ll	do	my	best,	little	guy.”	He	picked	the	boy	up	in	his arms	and	carried	him	to	the	front	room.	“Kenny,	I’ve	got	to	set	you	down	while	I get	my	keys	and	stuff.	Can	you	hang	on	until	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	set	him	on	the	couch.	He	hurried	into	his	office,	gathered	his	wallet	and keys,	and	the	folder	containing	Kenny’s	medical	records. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	came	back	outside,	Kenny	gasped	for	breath,	his	face	pale,	eyes	wide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	ran	to	him.	“Kenny?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a>“Daddy,	I	can’t	breath,”	he	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">At	least	he	can	breathe	enough	to	talk. </i>	It	would	have	to	be	enough.	“We’re leaving	right	now,	little	guy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	lifted	the	boy	in	his	arms,	then	struggled	to	open	the	door.	He	left	it open	behind	them,	ran	to	the	truck	and	loaded	Kenny	in.	The	sky	was	streaked with	red.	Murphy	buckled	the	boy	in,	then	climbed	in	the	driver’s	seat	and started	the	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	drove	as	fast	as	he	could	on	the	twisting,	curving	roads.	After	twenty	years he	knew	the	way	well,	and	he	pushed	the	bounds	of	safety	as	he	raced	around hairpin	curves	and	over	hills. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kenny	sat	in	his	booster	seat,	curled	up,	leaning	his	head	against	the	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every	once	in	a	while	he	would	moan	from	the	pain.	The	headlights	from approaching	cars	lit	up	his	face	in	a	pale,	washed	out	light.	Each	time,	Murphy glanced	over,	straining	to	hear—was	he	still	breathing?	He	would	never,	ever forget	the	sight	of	his	son,	then	five	years	old,	on	a	respirator,	unable	to	breathe without	a	machine.  <i class="calibre3">Please	God, </i>	he	thought,  <i class="calibre3">just	let	me	get	him	to	the	hospital	in</i> <i class="calibre3">time.	Please.	Don’t	take	my	son.	Take	me,	but	not	my	son. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sky	was	dark	when,	tires	screeching,	he	pulled	into	the	turnaround	at	the emergency	room	entrance	to	the	county	hospital.	He	jumped	out	of	the	car	and called	out,	“Please	help,”	to	the	hospital	workers	who	stood	smoking	at	the entrance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	lifted	Kenny	out	of	the	car	and	hurried	in	through	the	automatic	doors, brushing	off	the	workers	at	the	door	who	were	only	then	putting	out	their cigarettes.	The	doctors	met	him	at	the	door	and	lowered	Kenny	into	a	gurney. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	emergency	room	doctor	fired	off	a	series	of	questions	at	Murphy,	who handed	over	the	folder	with	the	medical	records. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	all	in	there.	He’s	been	in	here	a	couple	times	before,	he	has adrenoleukodystrophy.	I’m	worried	about	his	breathing,	he	said	he’s	having trouble.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	hurried	into	the	exam	room.	“Does	he	take	any	medication?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	takes	lovastatin	daily,	sometimes	Tylenol	with	codeine	for	the	pain,	but	not</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a>in	the	last	couple	weeks.	Also	dilantin,	to	control	the	seizures.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	doctor	went	back	to	work.	Murphy	stood,	arms	folded,	and	watched,	aching to	do	something,	anything	to	help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	helpless	and	it	was	killing	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	hours	later,	Murphy	stood	riveted	outside	the	intensive	care	unit,	watching his	son	through	a	glass	door.	Kenny	was	breathing	with	the	assistance	of	a respirator,	and	the	rasping	noise	filled	the	room.	He	looked	tiny	under	the	weight of	the	wires	and	equipment	piled	around	the	room.	The	nurses	and	doctors	in	the ICU	stepped	around	him	with	care,	and	lowered	their	voices	as	they	spoke.  <i class="calibre3">They</i> <i class="calibre3">must	think	he’s	not	going	to	make	it.	It’s	a	blessing	he’s	asleep	and	can’t	see	all</i> <i class="calibre3">this	stuff.	It	would	scare	hell	out	of	him. </i> Murphy	wondered	if	it	was	time	to	call Valerie.	With	a	quick	intake	of	breath,	he	dismissed	the	thought.	He	couldn’t give	in	so	easily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	felt	a	tap	on	his	shoulder	and	looked	around.	Hal	Perkins,	Kenny’s neurologist,	had	arrived.	Respected	as	one	of	the	top	neurologists	in	West Virginia,	he	had	still	been	unable	to	help	Kenny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dr.	Perkins,”	Murphy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ken.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	stood	together	in	silence,	and	looked	at	the	boy.	Ken	could	hear	the monitors	beep	quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ken,	I	think	it’s	time	we	had	a	talk	about	long	term	options.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	felt	heat	rise	to	his	face.	What	was	that	supposed	to	mean? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	I	mean	is…	It’s	a	matter	of	time	before	Kenny	has	a	seizure	and	you won’t	get	him	here	in	time.	He’ll	stop	breathing	and	won’t	be	able	to	start	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kenny	is	a	strong	little	boy,	but	this	thing	is	destroying	his	nervous	system.	You saw	his	last	set	of	test	results.	He’s	losing	control	of	his	extremities,	and	he’s starting	to	get	Addison’s	Disease—that’s	the	increase	in	pigmentation;	have	you noticed	how	much	he	tanned	this	summer?	His	vision	is	also	failing;	he’ll	almost</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a>certainly	be	blind	within	a	matter	of	months.	Those	are	the	beginning	signs	that the	last	stages	of	illness	have	been	reached.	In	a	few	months	he	may	lose	the ability	to	walk.	Do	you	understand	the	seriousness	of	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	felt	his	eyebrows	twitch	and	his	jaw	tense.	He	spoke	in	a	low,	sharp tone.	“Dr.	Perkins,	this	is	what	I	live	with	every	day.	I’ve	been	asking	you	and every	other	doctor	on	the	planet	for	answers	for	the	last	two	years.	Don’t	tell	me it’s	time	to	get	goddamn	serious.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perkins	held	his	hand	up,	palm	toward	Murphy.	“Ken,	you	misunderstand.	What I’m	saying	is,	I…	I	don’t	have	any	answers	for	you.	All	I	can	do	is	watch	him deteriorate,	same	as	you.	I	do	have	a	recommendation,	however.	Last	month	a team	of	doctors	at	Cincinatti	published	a	paper	describing	an	experimental treatment.	They’ve	only	tried	it	with	a	dozen	or	so	of	the	worst	cases,	but	in	at least	a	few	of	those	cases	results	have	been	positive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	positive?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	get	your	hopes	up;	treatment	failed	in	half	the	cases	they	described.	In	the other	cases,	the	treatment	arrested	further	deterioration,	and	the	children	have been	able	to	continue	normal	lives,	within	limits,	and	with	continued	treatment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	far	the	oldest	is	fifteen.	Understand:	none	have	improved.	No	one	is	getting better,	and	you	need	to	get	that	hope	out	of	your	mind.	However,	in	some	cases the	deterioration	was	arrested.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	how	do	we	get	signed	up?	I’m	unemployed	anyway,	I	might	as	well	be	in Ohio	as	here	if	it	will	help	Kenny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	don’t	we	go	down	to	my	office	and	call	them	right	now.	I	took	the	liberty of	sending	an	e-mail	with	a	summary	of	Kenny’s	case	to	the	head	of	the program.	We’ll	see	what	the	situation	is.	I	think	your	son	will	be	a	good candidate	for	the	new	trial.	He’s	progressing…	well,	very	quickly.	It’s	a	federally funded	study—it	may	be	we	can	get	you	in	at	no	cost.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	took	a	last	look	in	at	his	little	boy.	The	monitors	were	still	running,	and he	was	still	breathing.	Maybe	there	was	some	hope.	Just	maybe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	Wednesday	they	left	for	Cincinnati. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">September	12</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Things	just	weren’t	coming	together	for	Brian	Ibrahim.	For	the	second	week	in	a row,	he	was	working	third	shift,	when	there	wasn’t	another	soul	in	the Charleston	Federal	Building,	and	he	could	hear	his	steps	echo	on	the	marble floors	as	he	walked	his	rounds,	checking	the	empty	offices,	the	parking	lots,	and the	lobby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	hadn’t	done	anything	to	get	the	assignment	twice	in	a	row.	But	the	new Security	Chief,	Ralph	O’Malley—he	was	something	else.	Said	he	didn’t	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">“towel	heads.”	His	brother	had	been	a	New	York	fireman,	and	lost	some	friends in	the	World	Trade	Center.	O’Malley	thought	all	the	towel-heads	should	go	back to	their	own	countries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brian	thought	his	new	boss	needed	to	take	his	foul	attitude	and	shove	it	where the	sun	didn’t	shine.	Brian	had	been	born	in	Dearborn,	Michigan,	played	on	the football	team,	and	then	served	as	a	Ranger	and	bomb	disposal	specialist	in	the United	States	Army.	This	 <i class="calibre3">was</i>	his	country,	whether	that	Irish	bigot	liked	it	or	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	elevator	reached	the	ground	floor.	Brian	told	himself	for	the	hundredth	time he	needed	to	chill	out.	He	was	a	student	at	Marshall	University	on	the	GI	bill, and	worked	nights	as	a	security	guard	at	the	Federal	Building	to	help	cover	the bills.	Normally—at	least	until	the	last	couple	weeks—he	worked	second	shift only.	Now	he	was	suffering	in	school,	just	trying	to	stay	awake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	stepped	off	the	elevator	into	the	cavernous	lobby,	he	froze.	The	service door	stood	wide	open,	and	the	acrid	smell	of	smoke	drifted	from	the	hall	beyond. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slow	and	calm,	he	unsnapped	his	holster	and	raised	his	pistol,	a	black	.45-caliber Glock,	and	engaged	the	slide	to	chamber	a	round.	He	held	the	heavy	pistol	in front	of	him,	the	plastic-and-rubber	grip	warm	in	his	hand.	His	heart	pounded	in his	chest.	Except	for	target	practice,	he’d	not	held	a	weapon	in	earnest	since	he left	the	Army.	He	walked	toward	the	open	door,	keying	the	microphone	he	wore</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p170"></a>at	his	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Base,	this	is	Unit	Three.	We’ve	got	a	possible	burglary	in	progress	at	the Federal	Building,	with	an	open	utility	door	and	smoke.	I’m	investigating	at	this time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	tired	voice	issued	from	the	speaker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roger,	Unit	Three.	I	will	alert	the	police	and	fire	department	and	get	them	en route	to	your	location.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brian	stepped	into	the	dark	doorway.	Beyond,	the	normally	brightly	lit	hall	with grey	painted	walls	and	scuffed	floor	lay	shrouded	in	darkness.	Flashlight	in	one hand	and	pistol	in	the	other,	Brian	stepped	forward.	He	passed	the	light	across the	hall.	No	one.	He	took	another	step.	His	shoe	squeaked	as	he	stepped	forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	part	of	the	building	stank	with	a	slight	odor	of	garbage;	just	at	the	end	of the	hallway,	the	exit	to	the	back	parking	lot	opened	beside	the	dumpster.	Not	so pretty	in	here:	the	marble	floor	of	the	lobby	gave	way	to	concrete,	the	walls unpainted	drywall,	grey	and	dingy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	security.	I’m	armed.	If	you’re	there,	come	out	now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	voice	echoed.	He	leaned	to	his	left	and	peered	around	the	first	corner	into	an open	doorway.	No	one.	Christ,	why	didn’t	he	take	the	job	at	the	college bookstore? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	DHS	had	shown	up	on	his	doorstep	a	week	after	the	bombing,	and	he’d	even been	taken	into	custody	briefly	when	they	found	his	military	records	and	realized he	knew	a	hell	of	a	lot	about	bombs.	Brian	almost	lost	his	job	over	that	one.	The feds	let	him	go—there	was	no	reason	to	hold	him,	no	connection	at	all,	and	he was,	in	fact,	an	American	citizen,	whatever	the	DHS	might	think. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Who	the	hell	knew	who	was	a	terrorist?	What	if	there	was	a	bomb	or	something in	the	building?	What	if	some	redneck	decided	to	get	rid	of	the	local	IRS	office to	save	himself	from	writing	a	check?	A	coal	miner,	pissed	because	the	Bureau of	Mines	had	turned	down	a	complaint,	ready	to	do	justice	to	those	government pissants?	Time	to	find	a	new	job.	This	one	didn’t	pay	worth	a	damn	anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	moved	on	to	the	next	doorway.	No	one.	Then	he	froze.	What	the	hell	was that? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p171"></a>In	the	utility	closet,	tucked	behind	the	mop	buckets,	a	cube	the	size	of	a cinderblock	lay	wrapped	in	burlap.	Crude	wiring	ran	to	a	cheap	timer	fuse.	It was	piss-poor	work—whoever	did	this	was	a	rank	amateur.	No	question	what	it was	though.	The	timer	was	counting	down,	already	too	close	to	zero. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	didn’t	have	any	tools,	but	his	pocketknife	would	do,	if	he	was	careful.	He wiped	sweat	off	his	forehead,	suddenly	hot,	though	it	was	only	sixty-five	degrees in	the	building.	He’d	done	this	a	hundred	times	in	the	Army—in	practice anyway.	He	examined	the	wiring,	loosely	wrapped	around	two	posts	on	the timer.	Brian	held	his	breath	and	unscrewed	the	posts,	then	pulled	the	wires	loose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	radio	crackled	again	and	he	jerked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Unit	Three,	this	is	base.	The	police	are	arriving	at	your	location.	Switch	over	to their	frequency	at	this	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brian	keyed	the	mike	at	his	shoulder.	“Roger,	base.	Tell	the	police	there’s	a bomb	in	here.	I	disarmed	it	but	they’ll	need	to	call	the	bomb	disposal	team.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	reached	down	to	his	belt	to	change	to	the	local	police	frequency,	but	he	was too	late.	When	the	first	police	officer	reached	the	front	door	of	the	building,	the car	bomb	just	out	front	exploded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dave	Hansen	was	the	unfortunate	officer	who	picked	that	moment	to	approach the	front	door	of	the	Federal	Building	on	Virginia	Street.	A	rookie	officer,	his wife	was	at	home	asleep—or	more	likely	awake—with	their	six-week-old daughter.	His	wife	and	daughter	would	never	see	him	again,	because	the	force	of the	explosion	drove	him	through	the	plate	glass	windows,	already	disintegrating, fifty	feet	through	the	lobby	of	the	building.	Seconds	later	two	hundred	tons	of steel,	glass	and	concrete	crashed	down	on	top	of	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dave’s	partner,	Clinton,	didn’t	live	any	longer.	He	had	no	family	in	Charleston except	an	Irish	setter	who	would	shortly	find	herself	in	the	city	animal	shelter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	third	casualty,	eventually	identified	from	his	military	DNA	records,	was	Scott Heuser.	Scott	was	homeless,	and	slept	on	a	bench	at	the	corner	of	the	building when	he	and	the	bench	were	thrown	two	hundred	yards	and	slammed	into	the marquee	of	the	Charleston	Players	Theater. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p172"></a>*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Charleston	Fire	Engine	12	was	speeding	up	Main	Street,	lights	flashing,	when the	car	bomb	exploded.	Just	far	enough	away	they	weren’t	killed,	the	truck screeched	to	a	stop	when	a	flying	concrete	block	slammed	into	the	front	and smashed	the	radiator. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Holy	shit!”	screamed	the	driver.	“Call	the	Chief,	we’re	going	to	need	some serious	backup.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	there,	the	alarms	went	out,	alerting	the	country	that	yet	another	terrorist incident	had	occurred	on	American	soil.	It	would	be	some	time	before	anyone realized	these	were	the	opening	shots	of	a	new	war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	phone	rang	at	2:00	a.m.	Slowly,	Mike	Morris	rolled	onto	his	side,	reached out	to	the	table	and	lifted	the	phone	to	his	ear.	Any	call	at	this	hour	had	to	be	bad news. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Morris,”	he	said,	voice	rough,	disturbing	the	silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain	Morris,	this	is	Sergeant	Wilson.	We’re	being	alerted,	sir.	I’ve	been instructed	to	inform	you	this	is	not	a	drill.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	grimaced.  <i class="calibre3">Not	again,	so	soon. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	Sergeant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	hung	up	the	phone	and	sat	up,	then	opened	the	drawer	of	his	bedside	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	alert	list	was	folded	in	the	side	of	the	drawer.	Each	soldier	on	the	list	had another	one	to	call,	to	ensure	the	entire	company	got	the	word	quickly.	Morris made	his	calls,	then	turned	to	Alicia.	She	was	already	awake,	blanket	pulled	up to	her	neck,	watching	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	hon.	We’re	being	alerted	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alicia?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p173"></a>She	rolled	over	and	turned	her	back	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	sighed.	“Hon,	I	have	to	go.	I	wish	I	had	another	choice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stood,	switched	on	the	bedroom	light,	then	walked	to	the	closet	and	pulled out	his	camouflage	uniform. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Very	quietly	she	muttered,	“Bullshit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	lowered	the	clothes	he	had	in	his	arms	and	said,	“I’m	sorry?	Didn’t	quite catch	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	said	bullshit,”	she	responded,	louder.	“You	have	a	choice.	You	could	resign your	commission.	You’ve	done	your	time	playing	boyscout.	Mike,	you’ve	spent half	our	marriage	out	in	the	field	or	on	deployments.	I’m	tired	of	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alicia,	this	is	what	I	do.	It’s	who	I	am.	I	won’t	resign	my	commission.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you	leave	now,	don’t	come	back.	I’ve	had	it.	I’ll	divorce	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	did	not	answer.	He	pulled	his	pants	and	t-shirt	on,	and	then	buttoned	his camouflage	blouse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	hear	what	I	said,	goddammit?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	glanced	at	her.	She	still	lay	there,	flat	on	her	back	now	with	the	blanket pulled	over	her	body,	the	narrow	vertical	line	between	her	eyebrows	demanding a	response. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	what	you	have	to	do,	Alicia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	walked	out	the	door	of	the	bedroom	and	down	the	hall	to	Savannah’s room.	She	lay	in	her	bed,	curled	under	the	blue-and-white	quilt	Morris’s	mother made	her	last	year	for	Christmas,	the	one	with	the	pictures	of	queens,	stars,	and princesses	all	over	it.	Her	mouth	was	slightly	open	as	she	slept—her	nose	was always	stuffy	from	the	ragweed	this	time	of	year.	He	could	just	hear	her	breath whisper	through	the	gap	between	her	two	front	teeth.	One	of	the	teeth	was	loose; it	would	be	gone	in	another	week. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p174"></a>It	would	be	easy	to	walk	away	from	Alicia.	Impossible	to	walk	away	from Savannah.	Looking	at	her,	he	thought	about	turning	around,	apologizing,	trying to	smooth	it	over.	What	would	it	be	like	for	Savannah	to	grow	up	in	a	home poisoned	by	resentment	and	anger? </p>
<p class="calibre1">No.	Time	to	move.	Very	quietly,	he	leaned	over	and	kissed	her	silky,	cool	cheek. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	always	packed	field	gear	sat	in	the	closet,	ready	for	deployment.	He	slung the	pack	over	his	back,	then	walked	out	the	front	door.	The	light	in	the	bedroom went	out	as	he	drove	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	phone	next	to	Karen	Greenfield’s	bed	rang	three	times	before	she	woke	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Foggy,	she	rolled	over	and	put	the	phone	to	her	ear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Karen,	this	is	Vince	Elkins,”	said	the	voice	at	the	other	end.	The	tone	of	his voice	jerked	her	awake.	She	sat	up	in	the	darkness.	“We’ve	been	called	up	by	the Governor.	Some	son	of	a	bitch	blew	up	the	federal	building	in	Charleston.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	God,	no,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	on	duty,	Captain.	Now	you	can	say,	‘Oh,	God,	no,	sir.’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roger,	sir,”	she	said,	and	wondered	how	he	could	make	jokes	in	this circumstance.	“I’ll	get	my	company	moving.	What	time	do	we	roll?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Zero-eight-hundred.	I’ll	be	in	command;	Colonel	Murphy	is	out	of	state	for	a while.	We’ll	be	truck	mounted	for	the	time	being—infantry.	This	job	is	going	to be	guard	duty.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	get	in	as	soon	as	you	can	and	get	your	company	moving.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	hung	up	without	a	further	word.	She	switched	on	the	light,	walked	to	her desk	and	picked	up	the	cordless	phone.	Even	as	she	pulled	out	her	field equipment,	she	started	making	calls.	She	didn’t	have	much	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p175"></a>Even	as	the	military	geared	up	to	surround	and	protect	the	now	demolished building,	civil	authorities	had	arrived	at	the	scene—a	scene	of	chaos	at	this	point as	dozens	of	fire	trucks,	ambulances	and	police	cars	descended	on	the	area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three	helicopters	from	the	130th	Airlift	Wing	at	Yeager	Field	circled	over	the site,	warning	away	civilian	and	news	choppers.	High	above,	two	fighter	jets arrived	on	station	to	fly	combat	air	patrol.	Air	traffic	into	and	out	of	Charleston was	grounded.	The	local	emergency	personnel	had	been	first	on	the	scene,	and worked	to	define	the	extent	of	the	damage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	as	with	the	Murrah	Building	in	Oklahoma	City	twenty	years	ago,	the	entire front	of	the	building	was	sheared	off,	with	most	of	the	top	three	floors	crashed down	into	those	beneath.	Downtown	Charleston	lay	under	a	blanket	of	smoke and	dust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Across	the	street	several	partially	vacant	office	buildings	were	seriously damaged,	but	no	one	had	been	present	in	the	building	at	the	time	of	the explosion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Twenty	minutes	after	the	blast,	fire	department	and	rescue	workers	started	to clear	a	path	to	the	Federal	building	and	cordoned	off	the	area	directly surrounding	it.	Urgent	calls	went	to	the	various	agencies	to	determine	who	might have	been	in	the	building	at	3:00	a.m.	Initial	returns	indicated	the	only	individual expected	to	be	there	was	the	security	contractor,	Armor	Security. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	name	of	the	employee	on	duty?	Brian	Ibrahim.	An	Iraqi-American. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Unaware	of	the	feverish	activity	taking	place	a	few	dozen	yards	away,	Brian	lay on	his	back	and	prayed	he	would	have	the	opportunity	to	escape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	tiny	cavity	he	occupied	was	too	small	to	sit	up.	He	couldn’t	move—in	fact, he	couldn’t	feel	anything	below	his	waist.	Couldn’t	see	either;	he	was	in	absolute darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Very	slowly,	he	stretched	his	right	hand	and	arm.	He	was	unable	to	touch	a	wall to	his	right,	but	to	his	left	he	could	feel	a	wall.	A	pillar	of	concrete	lay	across	his waist.	He	could	feel	it	with	his	hands,	but	not	where	it	rested	across	his	waist	and legs.	Brian	knew	what	that	meant:	it	had	crushed	or	severed	his	spine.	Which meant,	if	he	got	out	of	here	alive,	he	would	be	in	a	wheelchair. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p176"></a>Better	a	wheelchair	than	dead.	The	real	trick	would	be	to	live	through	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rescue	workers	must	be	looking	for	him	by	now,	but	Brian	forced	himself	to	be serious.	They’d	never	even	found	all	the	bodies	in	New	York,	and	Brian	couldn’t help	but	wonder	just	how	many	people	there	were	here	like	him,	crushed	but alive,	lying	there	for	how	many	days	before	they	suffocated	or	starved	or	burned to	death,	with	months	to	go	before	the	rubble	was	cleared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Christ,	what	the	hell	was	he	thinking?  <i class="calibre3">The	radio! </i>	He	reached	for	the	radio handset	at	his	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyone	out	there?	This	is	Unit	Three.	Base?	Can	you	hear	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	response.	He	waited,	then	sighed.	Either	the	radio	couldn’t	work	under	all this	rock,	or	it	was	damaged.	Or	the	dispatcher	was	off	taking	a	piss	at	the	worst possible	time,	who	the	hell	knew? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	tried	to	reach	for	his	cell	phone	left-handed,	and	gasped	at	the	sharp	pain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arm	might	be	broken,	or	at	least	strained	pretty	badly.	Could	he	reach	across	his body	with	his	right	arm?	He	reached	across	his	chest	with	his	right	hand,	trying to	find	it.	No	phone.	It	might	be	just	two	feet	away,	but	might	as	well	be	two miles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	stuck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Though	Brian	didn’t	know	it,	things	weren’t	going	any	better	for	him	on	the surface.	Ralph	O’Malley,	his	boss,	stood	at	his	front	door	three	miles	away	in	a stained	white	t-shirt,	talking	to	a	DHS	agent	who	was	beginning	the	already	fast moving	investigation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	tell	you	what	I	think,”	O’Malley	said.	“I’d	bet	it	was	that	Ibrahim	guy.	You haven’t	found	him	yet,	have	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t	answer	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	I	bet	you	won’t,	he’s	probably	long	gone	now.	I	never	trusted	that	guy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Understand,	I	don’t	have	nothing	against	towel	heads	in	general,	but	it’d	be	nice if	they’d	stay	in	their	own	countries,	if	you	know	what	I	mean.	Anyway,	this	guy Ibrahim	had	a	bad	attitude.	Always	kept	to	himself,	real	loner	type.	I’ll	bet	he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p177"></a>blew	up	that	building	for	Allah	then	hauled	his	ass	back	to	Egypt	or	some	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	should	round	up	some	of	those	folks	in	Little	Cairo	or	whatever	the	hell they	call	it.	Someone	there	will	know	what	happened,	that’s	for	sure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	agent	nodded,	then	said,	“I’d	like	to	get	Ibrahim’s	personnel	file,	if	that’s possible.	Can	we	drive	to	your	office?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	just	let	me	get	something	on,	all	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	agent	nodded	and	took	out	his	phone	and	made	a	report. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	watched	the	news	in	his	hotel	room	as	the	sun	rose	outside.	Images	of the	collapsed	building	flashed	on	the	screen	as	the	commentators	discussed	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Middle	Eastern”	connection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	bad	news	frequently	does,	word	of	the	bombing	spread	quickly.	Before	the sun	came	up,	DHS	already	had	a	prime	suspect	and	a	leak	to	the	media:	one Brian	Ibrahim,	a	security	guard	who	had	access	to	the	building,	a	loner	from	out of	state	who	kept	to	himself,	an	Iraqi	who	had	a	high	degree	of	expertise	in explosives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	had	received	the	alert	call	at	three	in	the	morning.	Three	months	ago,	he would	have	welcomed	the	chance	to	have	some	income,	put	his	unit	to	work,	to make	something	out	of	a	disaster.	Now…	Kenny	was	in	the	hospital,	seeing some	progress.	Murphy	didn’t	want	to	leave,	no	matter	what	the	circumstances were. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	he	had	a	job	to	do.	His	mother	was	already	on	a	plane	from	Atlanta,	and would	watch	over	Kenny	for	the	next	two	or	three	weeks,	the	longest	period	the alert	could	be	expected	to	last.	Once	she	was	here	and	introduced	to	the	hospital staff,	Murphy	would	drive	to	Charleston. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	good	news	was	Kenny	was	responding	to	the	therapy.	They’d	been	in Cincinnati	for	three	weeks,	and	no	attacks	since	then.	Not	even	a	muscle	spasm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kenny	was	happier	and	more	playful	than	he’d	been	in	over	a	year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	phone	rang,	and	he	almost	pounced. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p178"></a>“Murphy,”	he	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Colonel,	Vince	Elkins.	We’re	at	seventy	percent	now,	just	a	few	stragglers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’re	not	going	to	get	‘em	all—several	people	were	on	vacation;	no	one	was expecting	a	call-up	order.	We’ve	also	half	a	dozen	people	who	moved	away,	no one	seems	to	know	their	whereabouts.	Probably	left	the	state	looking	for	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	figured	as	much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.	Well,	get	this,	sir.	I	got	a	call	from	Charleston	about	an	hour	ago;	the initial	order	was	go	deployed	as	infantry,	but	now	we’ve	got	orders	to	load	up half	a	dozen	tanks	as	well.	What	the	hell	are	we	going	to	do	with	tanks	in Charleston?	It	sends	the	wrong	message,	sir.	Anyway,	I	assigned	that	one	to Captain	Greenfield’s	company.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	also	had	Corporal	Adler	go	to	your	house	and	break	in,	sir.	He	got	your uniforms	and	field	gear,	so	you	can	meet	us	in	Charleston,	no	need	to	drive	all the	way	hell	out	here.	He	says	he	didn’t	do	any	damage	or	steal	much	else.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	brief	pause	Elkins	said,	“I	didn’t	press	him	for	details.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	had	to	smile.	“Well,	Major,	I	will	hold	you	responsible	if	he	did.	Fair?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,	Colonel:	but	only	if	you	can	prove	it.	We’ll	meet	you	in	Charleston.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">September	12</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Agent	Justin	Hagarty	scrambled	his	team	from	Harpers	Ferry	and	arrived	by helicopter	in	Charleston	at	5:30	p.m.	Despite	the	urgency	of	the	situation	and	the desctruction	across	the	street	from	the	command	post,	they’d	been	standing around	for	an	hour,	waiting	for	the	Charleston	Field	Office	to	get	in	gear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty	had	offered	his	help,	but	Aaron	Manning,	an	outsider	from	Chicago	and the	local	Special	Agent	in	Charge,	refused	it.	Hagarty	had	worked	with	Manning before,	and	he	knew	that	as	an	out-of-stater,	Manning	didn’t	get	how	West Virginia	worked.	They’d	been	at	loggerheads	ever	since	June	and	the	Saturn Microsystems	screwup	anyway.	Manning	had	insisted	they	go	in	there	in	force, whatever	the	consequences,	and	left	Hagarty	holding	the	bag.	What	were	they, Nelson	Barclay’s	personal	police	force? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	this.	What	a	mess.	At	least	the	building	had	been	close	to	empty:	the Charleston	Field	Office,	located	on	the	third	floor	of	the	federal	building,	had been	completely	destroyed.	On	top	of	that	Manning	had	ordered	that	DHS</p>
<p class="calibre1">deploy	in	combat	gear	with	helmets,	as	perfect	a	case	as	Hagarty	had	ever	seen of	closing	the	bard	door	after	the	horse	escaped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aaron	Manning	came	into	the	musty	tent	they	were	using	as	a	temporary command	post,	followed	by	two	other	agents.	Rain	rattled	against	the	canvas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Electronics	gear	in	an	armored	personnel	carrier	provided	communications	to	the outside	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Twenty-five	agents	from	both	the	Charleston	and	Harpers	Ferry	field	offices—all of	them	wet	from	the	rain—crowded	the	tent.	A	layer	of	steam	floated	near	the ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	listen	up,”	shouted	Manning	over	the	rain.	“We’re	going	over	this quickly,	we’ve	got	a	lot	to	accomplish	in	a	short	time.	Here’s	what	we	know.	At approximately	1:00	a.m.,	the	night	security	guard	for	the	federal	building	called into	his	dispatcher	that	he	was	investigating	smoke	and	a	possible	burglary.	A few	minutes	later	he	called	back,	just	as	the	first	emergency	personnel	arrived	on the	scene.	He	indicated	to	his	dispatcher	that	he	had	found	a	bomb.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p180"></a>dispatcher	received	no	further	transmission.	Less	than	a	minute	later	a	car	bomb killed	the	first	responders	and	destroyed	the	front	of	the	building.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manning	gestured	to	another	agent,	who	handed	out	color-copied	photographs	of an	olive-skinned	man	in	an	Army	uniform. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	our	prime	suspect,	gentleman.	His	name	is	Brian	Ibrahim.	He	is	a	US</p>
<p class="calibre1">citizen	of	Iraqi	descent	and	an	explosives	expert,	thanks	to	training	provided	by Uncle	Sam.	Mr.	Ibrahim	worked	for	a	local	security	contractor,	and	was	on	shift at	the	time	of	the	explosion.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty	glanced	over	at	Larry	Harris,	one	of	his	senior	special	agents.	They’d known	each	other	five	years,	and	didn’t	need	to	say	the	words.	It	figured	he’d been	trained	by	the	Army. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,”	Manning	continued,	“we	have	some	other	people	we’re	looking	into.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	other	agent	passed	out	another	sheet.	This	one	held	two	smaller photographs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	woman	on	the	left	is	Sasha	Zana,	Ibrahim’s	girlfriend,	of	Kurdish	descent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	is	Mahmoud	Kamel,	a	Palestinian.	All	three	of	them	recently	made anti-American	statements	at	a	pro-Palestinian	rally	just	two	weeks	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manning	turned	and	pointed	to	a	map	attached	to	a	tripod,	already	marked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	here’s	the	plan.	First,	the	Charleston	office.	Wilson,	your	team	will	cover the	main	site,	work	with	the	forensics	and	rescue	teams	to	look	for	evidence,	or for	Brian	Ibrahim	if	it	turns	out	he	stayed	in	the	building	when	the	bomb	went off.	Don’t	assume	he	left—these	people	do	suicide	bombings	all	the	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marcus,	I	want	you	to	split	your	guys	up,	follow	up	with	Ibrahim’s	past employers,	with	the	University,	all	the	local	police	departments.	I	want	to	know everything	about	his	movements	in	the	last	three	months,	as	well	as	the movements	of	Zana	and	Kamel.	Hagarty,	how	many	men	did	you	bring	from Harpers	Ferry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	good.	You’ll	cover	Little	Cairo.	You	know	the	area?	This	whole	part	of town	was	flooded	by	immigrants,	mostly	from	the	Middle	East,	around	ten, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p181"></a>fifteen	years	ago,	about	six	square	blocks.	You’ve	got	two	missions:	first,	find any	of	our	suspects,	and	second,	look	for	targets	of	opportunity.	Anyone	you think	might	be	an	illegal,	or	might	know	something,	detain	as	a	witness.	We’ll sort	them	out	later	this	week.	We’ve	borrowed	a	couple	of	buses	from	the Department	of	Corrections.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty	grimaced.	“You’re	kidding,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manning	frowned.	“No,	I’m	not.	The	Secretary	has	authorized	a	house-to-house search.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right.	The	civil	libertarians	will	go	bananas	on	this	one.	Do	we	have	a warrant?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Civil	libertarians,	my	ass.	Anybody	notice	the	pile	of	smoking	rubble	across	the street?	This	is	the	second	terrorist	attack	in	six	months,	and	we	know	there’s	a Middle	Eastern	connection	this	time.	Anyway,	the	Secretary	is	working	on	a warrant,	don’t	worry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	we’re	on	it.	I’ll	need	some	bodies	to	contain	the	area;	I	can’t	do	it with	eight	guys.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	a	National	Guard	unit	detailed	to	provide	perimeter	security	when	you start.	Until	they	arrive,	just	post	your	men	at	the	intersections	and	watch	for	the prime	suspects.	Once	you’ve	got	your	perimeter,	proceed	with	the	rest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty	shoved	his	hands	in	his	pockets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	on	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	minutes	later	they	broke	up,	and	Hagarty	stepped	outside	into	the	rain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carefully	shielding	his	lighter	under	his	helmet,	he	lit	a	cigarette. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seconds	later	Larry	Harris	joined	him.	Harris	had	seen	better	days.	There	were dark	circles	under	his	eyes	now,	and	unusual	stress	lines	split	his	forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	Harris.	How’s	it	going?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	good,	boss.	Not	good.	We	don’t	need	any	more	screwed	up	operations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manning…	He	doesn’t	get	it,	does	he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p182"></a>“Yeah,	I	know.	This	is	going	to	piss	off	a	lot	of	folks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harris	lit	his	own	cigarette,	took	a	deep	drag,	then	exhaled.	“I	need	to	take	some time	off,	and	soon.	Sarah	says	I	keep	waking	up	the	kids	at	night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty	looked	over	at	Harris.	“Nightmares?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harris	shrugged.	“It’s	been	a	really	bad	year.	That	guy	Matley	shot,	then	the	god-awful	mess	in	Harpers	Ferry	last	week.	You	weren’t	there,	boss.	When	that asshole	threw	the	grenade,	the	volunteer	who	got	it	went	up	like	a	torch.	I	never even	saw	her	before	she	went	up	in	flames.	And	the	cop—man,	he	was	right	out of	college,	very	young.	Said	he’d	been	with	the	force	about	eight	months.	What a	waste.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty	put	his	hand	on	Harris’s	shoulder.	“Look,	Larry.	How	long	you	been doing	this?	Seven	years?	Maybe	you	do	need	a	break.	It’s	been	pretty	bad lately.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	it	has.	Seems	like	it’s	getting	worse.	We’ve	had—what,	ten,	fifteen incidents	in	the	last	two	years?	I	just	don’t	know	if	I	can	take	it.	Seems	like every	step	we	take,	the	terrorists	get	smarter	and	more	dangerous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty	squeezed	his	friend’s	shoulder.	“Larry,	stick	with	me	through	this	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Do	that,	and	I	promise	I’ll	get	you	a	leave	of	absence,	six	weeks	or	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Can	you	do	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harris	bounced	his	head,	took	another	drag.	“Yeah,	that	sounds	about	right.	Six weeks	away	from	all	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	remember,”	Hagarty	said,	gesturing	at	the	smoking	pile	of	stone	and	steel, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Every	day	you	do	your	job,	you’re	keeping	your	family	safe	from	that.	You know	we	got	a	confession	from	the	leader	of	those	people	at	Baughman settlement?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah?	I	hadn’t	heard	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty	nodded.	“Just	yesterday—it’s	being	kept	under	wraps	until	they	have	the case	ready	for	trial.	Fucking	religious	nuts.	It	was	all	about	gays,	believe	it	or not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p183"></a>“<i class="calibre3">What? </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly	my	reaction.	You	remember	about	fifteen	years	ago,	that	Baptist	church that	was	going	around	picketing	soldier’s	funerals	during	Iraq?  <i class="calibre3">God	hates	fags? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">This	guy	was	one	of	their	converts,	and	he	decided	to	go	a	little	further	than insulting	people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harris	shook	his	head.	“Jesus	Christ.	What	happens	next?	Will	the	confession hold	up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty	caught	the	subtext	of	his	question.	“Yeah	–	this	one	was	by	the	book—</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	coercion	involved.	He	practically	dictated	a	manifesto.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	looked	at	each	other,	and	Hagarty	grinned.	“We’ll	get	the	folks	who	did this	one,	too.	Don’t	worry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harris	shrugged.	“All	right.”	He	shook	his	head.	“Wonder	if	this	was	some	of	the same	folks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Could	be,”	Hagarty	replied.	“Could	be.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">By	the	time	the	sun	rose,	a	torrent	was	pouring	down	on	West	Virginia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Surrounding	the	chaos	around	the	federal	building	were	dozens	of	emergency vehicles	from	as	many	jurisdictions,	in	some	cases	blocking	streets	and preventing	access	to	others.	Over	a	hundred	people	were	working	on	the	site now,	searching	for	survivors.	A	massive	plume	of	smoke	filled	the	already	dark grey	sky,	even	as	the	rain	poured	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	the	rain,	spectators	crowded	the	streets	for	three	blocks	beyond	the police	barriers,	watching	the	disaster	unfold	so	close	to	their	homes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brian	Ibrahim	remained	unaware	of	the	rescue	efforts	above	as	he	lay	in	the darkness,	succumbing	to	shock	and	fever.	He’d	been	thinking	about	Sasha.	He closed	his	eyes	and	it	was	like	she	was	really	there	with	him.	Sasha	was…</p>
<p class="calibre1">amazing.	Long	black	hair,	full	figured,	red	lips,	beautiful.	Her	family	was Kurdish,	but	she	was	mostly	punk	rocker.	He	hadn’t	seen	her	in	a	couple	of	days, and	found	himself	regretting	it	now.	Of	course,	even	if	he	got	out	of	here,	she</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p184"></a>probably	wouldn’t	have	much	to	do	with	him	anymore.	She	wasn’t	going	to	push him	around	in	a	wheelchair	at	the	club;	that’s	for	sure.	And	he	knew	nothing down	below	was	going	to	work	anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	sighed,	stretched	out	his	right	arm	for	the	hundredth	time,	trying	to	find	the phone.	What	if	nobody	found	him?	He	didn’t	know	how	long	he’d	been	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Couple	days,	maybe?	His	stomach	was	in	an	agony	of	hunger,	but	worse,	he	was parched,	as	much	as	he’d	ever	been	in	his	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wait—a	noise.	Then	he	heard	them	more	clearly:	voices,	faint. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey!”	he	tried	to	shout.	Nothing	came	out	but	a	faint	rasp. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Dammit! </i>	He	tried	again.	“Hey!	Is	someone	there?	Hello.	Hello.	Help!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	couldn’t	get	any	sound	out.	Bang	something.	He	grabbed	one	of	the	many pieces	of	broken	concrete	with	his	right	arm	and	banged	it	on	the	column	resting across	his	body.	“Hey!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	banged	a	few	times,	then	waited.	He	heard	shouting.	“We	found	somebody.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	voices	were	still	very	faint,	but	it	was	clear	they	knew	he	was	here.	He’d been	found.	Thank	God.	He’d	been	found.	A	tear	rolled	down	his	cheek.	He’d been	found.	He	would	see	that	beautiful	girl	again.	He	would	have	a	life.	Oh, thank	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fifteen	feet	away,	rescuers	were	trying	to	clear	the	rubble	near	the	back	entrance of	the	federal	building.	This	side	of	the	building	was	surprisingly	intact.	In	fact, the	first	fifteen	feet	of	the	service	hallway	lay	virtually	untouched,	except	by dust.	Slightly	further	in,	the	walls	and	ceiling	had	collapsed.	Somewhere	under the	pile,	they	could	hear	tapping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Careful,”	one	of	the	men	said.	“We	don’t	want	to	shift	the	rubble	and	kill whoever’s	in	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowly,	carefully,	they	worked,	joined	by	another	group	of	firemen,	along	with one	man	in	a	DHS	windbreaker,	who	stood	back	near	the	entrance,	not	helping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	firefighters	carefully	avoided	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p185"></a>“Found	him,”	someone	shouted.	What	they	had	found	was	a	main	support column	with	two	blackened	feet	sticking	out	from	under	it.	The	legs	were crushed.	The	DHS	agent,	Bob	Horvath,	grimaced:	the	legs	looked	like	the Wicked	Witch	of	the	East’s	did	after	Dorothy’s	house	fell	on	her.	With	any	luck, Brian	Ibrahim	wouldn’t	get	off	so	easily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quickly,	they	cleared	the	rubble	on	the	other	side,	lifted	a	collapsed	wall	and there	lay	Brian	Ibrahim,	the	security	guard	and	probably	the	bomber.	Brian’s face	was	washed	out,	and	he	was	clearly	in	shock,	but	his	eyes	were	open	and alert. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	as	the	firemen	worked	feverishly	to	lift	the	column,	Horvath	came	forward and	knelt	beside	the	crushed	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Brian,	it	looks	like	you’re	going	to	be	okay.	These	guys	are	going	to	get	you	out of	here	and	take	you	to	the	hospital.	You’ll	be	as	good	as	new.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	pale	young	man	looked	up	at	him,	eyes	wide.	“My	legs?”	he	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Horvath	frowned.	“They’re	hurt	pretty	bad,	but	you’ll	be	fine.	You’ll	see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brian	sighed	in	obvious	relief	and	closed	his	eyes	for	a	moment.	“You	got	any water?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	agent	leaned	close	and	looked	Brian	in	the	eyes.	“In	just	a	minute.	I	need	to ask	you	something	first.	Do	you	know	who	did	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brian’s	eyes	opened.	“No.	Do	you	have	any	leads	yet?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	we’ve	got	a	pretty	good	idea.	That’s	why	I’m	talking	to	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weight	shifted	on	the	heavy	column	and	Brian	cried	out	in	pain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	agent	took	his	chance.	“You	did	it,	didn’t	you?	This	was	supposed	to	be	a suicide	bombing,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brian	looked	at	him,	his	face	contorted	by	pain	and	sudden	anger.	“What	are	you talking	about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,	man.	We	know	all	about	you,	we’ve	dug	up	your	entire	background. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p186"></a>We	know	about	your	friends.	You	can	go	ahead	and	tell	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	crazy?	Get	away	from	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,	we	already	know	everything,	and	it’s	not	going	to	go	well	for	you.	Better you	tell	me	now.	Who	were	you	working	with?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brian	grimaced.	“Just	get	me	out	of	here.	I	didn’t	blow	up	shit,	asshole,	and	if	I wasn’t	stuck	under	this	pillar	I’d	jam	my	foot	so	far	up	your	ass,	your	eyes would	bug	out.	Get	away	from	me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	agent	shook	his	head	and	sighed.	Nobody	was	going	to	just	go	around killing	people	and	blowing	up	buildings	in	this	country.	Not	any	more.	Not	if	he could	help	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	hundred	miles	to	the	north,	Karen	Greenfield	stood	in	front	of	her	company. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	wind	and	rain	whipped	against	her	plastic	olive	raincoat,	and	water	streamed off	the	front	of	her	helmet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Men,	I	want	to	impress	upon	you	the	seriousness	of	this	situation.	West	Virginia has	been	attacked	by	terrorists.	In	Charleston	right	now	the	federal	building	lies under	thousands	of	tons	of	rubble,	and	no	one	knows	how	many	people	may	still be	in	there.	Our	job	in	this	is	to	provide	security.	The	Department	of	Homeland Security	will	conduct	the	investigation,	with	assistance	from	other	federal agencies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	of	the	men	in	the	ranks	stirred	at	the	mention	of	the	Department.	They weren’t	exactly	that	fond	of	the	DHS.	Not	any	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Couple	of	guidelines.	Unless	your	life	is	in	imminent	danger,	you	will	not	lock and	load	your	weapon.	Platoon	sergeants	will	issue	ammunition,	but	there	are	to be	no	incidents.	It’s	highly	unlikely	there	will	be	any	need	for	any	of	us	to	do anything	other	than	stand	around	and	look	mean.	I	want	to	keep	it	that	way.	We are	going	to	instill	confidence,	bring	calm	to	the	situation.	Investigations	and whatever	else	will	be	the	job	of	the	federal	authorities. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p187"></a>“Now,	one	final	comment.	I	am	all	too	aware	many	of	you—many	of	 <i class="calibre3">us</i>—have very	intense	personal	feelings	about	the	DHS.	Set	them	aside.	We	have	a	job	to do,	and	we	have	a	common	mission.	I	don’t	want	to	hear	a	peep	about	it.	Got	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	men	were	deadpan,	but	she	knew	anger	lurked	just	under	the	surface.	A dozen	of	these	men	had	worked	at	Saturn,	and	had	seen	firsthand	the	senseless brutality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“First	Sergeant,”	she	called,	and	stepped	back.	The	first	sergeant	dismissed	the formation	and	directed	the	men	onto	buses,	except	the	tank	commanders.	They would	be	accompany	their	tanks,	loaded	on	flatbed	trucks,	to	Charleston. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	men	boarded	the	buses,	Major	Elkins	approached	Karen.	She	saluted,	and he	returned	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	we’re	at	eighty	percent	now.	Best	we	can	do.	I’ve	got	six	men	who	have moved	away	in	the	last	six	weeks	to	look	for	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’ll	have	to	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Any	news,	sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	much.	The	radio	said	they	know	who	did	it,	some	Iraqi	student.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shielded	her	eyes	as	a	gust	of	wind	sprayed	icy	cold	drops	of	water	at	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Seems	pretty	early	to	say	who	did	it.	It’s	only	been	a	few	hours.	I	don’t	trust	the DHS,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	what	you	mean.	You’re	not	old	enough	to	remember	Oklahoma	City, but	everyone	assumed	it	was	a	Middle-Eastern	terror	attack	then,	too.	Pretty	big shock	for	everyone	when	they	caught	Tim	McVeigh.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I’ll	make	sure	my	guys	know	to	keep	their	opinions	to	themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Charleston	has	a	pretty	big	Arab	community.	I	don’t	want	us	making	the situation	worse.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	deal,	Karen.	Let’s	get	this	show	on	the	road.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.”	Karen	saluted. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p188"></a>He	returned	the	salute	and	walked	away.	She	stayed	and,	for	just	a	moment, watched	the	dark	clouds	roil	over	the	mountains,	then	walked	to	her	HUMMWV. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Corporal	Stanson,	her	driver,	sat	behind	the	wheel,	rocking	his	head	and	slapping his	hands	on	the	steering	wheel,	the	tune	of	music	inside	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	go,	Corporal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	ma’am,”	he	replied,	and	put	the	vehicle	in	gear.	Once	they	were	moving, he	tapped	the	steering	wheel	again.	She	wondered	what	the	song	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Watch	out,	watch	out!”	shouted	one	of	the	firemen	as	they	struggled	to	lift	the rubble	from	Brian	Ibrahim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brian’s	vision	faded	as	he	watched	them,	long	since	gone	into	shock.	He’d	been there	for	hours	by	the	time	they	found	him,	and	two	more	passed	as	they	tried	to remove	the	crushed	steel	and	concrete	without	killing	him.	Soon,	he	thought,	it would	be	too	late.	Everything	seemed	so	fuzzy,	he	hardly	cared.	Only	real problem	was	the	cold.	But	at	least	he	couldn’t	feel	any	pain.	One	of	the	feds	took great	pleasure	in	describing	Brian’s	blackened	and	crushed	feet	and	legs	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Son	of	a	bitch. </i>	How	could	they	think	he	would	do	something	like	this?	A	wave of	darkness	washed	over	him	and	his	already	grey	world	went	black. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	deep	underwater	he	regained	consciousness	to	see	two	doctors	at	his	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	heard	a	whine,	like	a	dentist’s	drill.	What	was	that? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	going	on?”	he	asked	groggily.	“Am	I	going	to	die	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">.“We’re	trying	to	get	you	free—we	have	to	get	you	to	a	hospital	now.	Try	to	stay calm,”	said	one	of	the	doctors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly	it	hit	him:	they	were	preparing	to	amputate	his	legs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	way.	Get…	get	away	from	me.”	His	voice	weak,	he	said,	“I	want	to	talk	to	a priest.	Let	me	see	a	priest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brian	saw	blood	splash	on	the	concrete	and	he	started	to	cry.	His	vision	went black. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p189"></a>Five	minutes	later	Brian	Ibrahim	made	it	to	the	ambulance,	but	it	was	too	late. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	rain	was	really	pouring	down	now,	and	Murphy	had	to	slow	down	to	a crawl.	The	Secretary	of	Homeland	Security	was	holding	a	press	conference	live on	the	radio.	The	threat	of	terrorism	was	still	out	there.	DHS	needed	more domestic	powers	to	do	their	duty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	gripped	the	steering	wheel	tighter	as	he	listened	to	the	words	on	the radio.	As	if	they	didn’t	have	too	much	power	already.	How	dare	they	use	a tragedy	of	this	magnitude	to	advance	their	political	agenda?	He’d	had	it	up	to here	with	politicians. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	car	slid	as	a	giant	truck	thundered	past	in	the	rain,	throwing	water	off	the highway	in	a	great	wave.	In	a	moment	it	was	gone,	taillights	fading	into	the distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	glanced	at	the	clock.	Another	hour	at	this	rate	before	he	reached	the	Capitol. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	two.	He’d	hated	leaving	Kenny	behind,	even	with	his	grandmother.	The boy	had	been	better	since	they’d	arrived	in	Cincinatti—better	than	he	had	any right	to	expect.	Murphy	knew	as	well	as	anyone	that	no	recovery	was	possible, but	if	they	could	just	keep	the	goddamn	disease	from	progressing,	that	would	be enough.	It	had	to	be	enough—he	didn’t	have	any	other	hope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Karen	Greenfield’s	HUMMWV	rolled	into	Charleston	at	fifteen	minutes before	noon.	The	convoy,	including	two	buses	of	men,	the	supply	truck,	the	first sergeant	in	his	Humvee,	and	the	four	very	large	trucks	with	tanks	on	their flatbeds,	followed	her.	As	they	drove	into	town,	people	stopped	and	stared	at	the camouflage	painted	behemoths.	Even	on	the	back	of	a	truck,	with	its	120mm cannon	locked	over	the	rear	deck,	an	Abrams	tank	was	a	frightening	machine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	the	events	of	this	morning,	Karen	thought	it	ominous	to	come	into	an American	city	with	tanks.	Who	was	this	designed	to	frighten?	The	terrorists	or the	citizens?	Or	did	the	DHS	not	make	a	distinction	any	more? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fifteen	minutes	later	she	stood	with	Major	Elkins	and	the	other	company</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p190"></a>commanders	in	Elkins’s	temporary	headquarters,	a	basement	office	in	the	State Capitol.	She	took	notes	in	a	pocket-sized	green	notebook	as	Elkins	laid	out where	each	company’s	positions	would	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen’s	team	was	split:	the	tank	platoon	would	be	positioned	around	the	state Capitol,	a	highly	visible	protective	force.	The	platoon,	armed	with	four	cannons and	twelve	heavy	machine	guns,	seemed	a	remarkably	heavy	force	to	protect	a building	from	what	was	an	unknown	threat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	didn’t	make	good	tactical	sense,	but	just	as	much,	it	didn’t	make	good	political sense.	As	a	citizen,	she	was	concerned	about	the	idea	of	tanks	patrolling	an American	city.	As	an	officer,	she	was	appalled	by	it.	But	those	were	her	orders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	other	part	made	more	sense,	at	least.	Her	second	and	third	platoons—</p>
<p class="calibre1">twenty-four	of	the	thirty-two	men	there	would	have	been	at	full	strength—would provide	perimeter	security	to	the	Little	Cairo	neighborhood,	only	twelve	blocks away.	One	violent	incident	had	already	occurred,	when	someone	threw	a	brick through	a	plate-glass	window	in	a	Lebanese	bakery.	Her	orders	were	to	maintain calm,	protect	the	civilian	residents	and	prevent	further	incidents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	may	have	some	other	tasks,	Captain	Greenfield.	My	understanding	is	that DHS	will	conduct	some	interviews	in	your	area	of	operations	today,	and	we’ve been	asked	to	provide	some	support	and	security	for	them	as	well.	This	will	be escort	duty.	A	couple	of	your	men	will	accompany	the	DHS	teams.	According	to my	orders,	they	have	some	suspects	who	may	still	be	in	the	area.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	looked	up	at	him	as	she	wrote.	“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	other	thing,”	Elkins	said.	“Make	sure	you	drive	it	home	to	your	men:	we are	here	to	protect	the	citizens	and	calm	the	situation	down.	I	want	everyone	to proceed	with	absolute	caution	and	calm.	I	don’t	need	to	say	this,	I	know,	but	just remind	your	people.	Last	thing	we	need	is	an	accusation	that	we	trampled	on people’s	civil	liberties.	I’ll	be	around	to	each	of	your	positions	later	today.	We’ll be	setting	up	the	battalion	command	post	here;	the	radios	should	be	up	shortly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elkins	dismissed	the	four	captains	and	they	went	their	separate	ways. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rain	stung	Morris’s	face	as	he	leaned	out	the	doors	of	the	helicopter.	He	glanced</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p191"></a>at	his	watch.	Almost	noon.	Even	in	this	lousy	weather,	he	could	see	the	plume	of black	smoke	that	rose	from	the	center	of	town.	The	choppers—six	of	them—</p>
<p class="calibre1">circled	around	the	south	side	of	the	demolished	federal	building.	Morris	could see	vehicles	below,	small	as	matchbox	cars,	many	of	them	with	emergency	lights flashing.	To	the	west,	in	front	of	what	must	be	the	State	Capitol	Building,	he could	see	a	group	of	tanks	offloading	from	trucks. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Tanks.	Holy	Christ. </i>	This	was	as	serious	as	could	be,	but	who	the	Christ	would think	of	deploying	tanks	around	the	State	Capitol?	What	kind	of	threat	were	they worried	about? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	lost	his	view	of	the	tanks	and	the	destruction	around	the	federal	building	as the	choppers	came	in	to	land	beside	the	river,	two	at	a	time.	He	jumped	off	first, followed	by	his	headquarters	team.	The	second	chopper	contained	part	of Sergeant	Kathleen	O’Donnell’s	First	Platoon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“First	Sergeant,”	called	Morris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	first	sergeant	approached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gather	the	men	in	formation	over	there,”	Morris	said,	pointing	to	a	spot	some distance	away	from	the	landing	zone.	“As	soon	as	we’ve	got	all	the	men,	we march	to	the	federal	building.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.	You	mean	the	men	and	the	ladies,	sir.”	The	first	sergeant	grinned	as	he spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	rolled	his	eyes.	“Whatever,	Top.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	brown	Crown	Victoria	drove	up,	headlights	shining,	wipers	on	high,	and	a man	with	a	black	windbreaker	got	out.	The	letters	DHS,	18	inches	high,	were emblazoned	on	the	back	of	his	windbreaker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	Captain	Morris?”	the	man	shouted	over	the	noise	of	the	incoming choppers.	He	held	up	a	hand	to	shield	his	eyes	from	the	rain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	Agent	Wilson	from	the	Charleston	Field	Office	of	Homeland	Security. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	sent	me	over	to	show	you	the	way	to	the	Federal	Building.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p192"></a>“All	right,	Agent	Wilson.	We’ve	got	a	couple	more	choppers	coming	in,	though. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’ll	have	to	wait	a	few	minutes.	What’s	the	situation	over	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wilson	shouted	over	the	noise.	“Could	be	worse,	Captain.	It	was	a	car	bomb	for sure,	pretty	damn	big	one,	but	almost	no	one	was	around,	went	off	in	the	middle of	the	night.	Security	guard	was	the	only	person	in	the	building.	Towel	head—</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	think	he’s	the	one	who	did	it.	A	couple	of	cops	got	killed,	they	were	entering the	building	when	the	bomb	went	off,	and	at	least	one	homeless	guy	got	killed, possibly	more.	We	don’t	know	if	anyone	was	in	the	offices	yet,	but	it’s	unlikely given	the	hour.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	grimaced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	guess	that	is	lucky.	Wonder	why	they	set	it	off	in	the	middle	of	the	night?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wilson	shook	his	head.	“Don’t	know	sir.	Maybe	a	mistake?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	next	load’s	just	about	it;	we’ll	be	ready	in	fifteen	minutes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Several	blocks	away,	in	the	small	enclave	known	as	“Little	Cairo”	for	the	last decade,	four	unmarked	sedans	pulled	to	a	stop	in	the	middle	of	the	street.	Justin Hagarty	stepped	out	of	the	car	and	looked	up	and	down	the	street.	The	block	was lined	with	two-and	three-story	shops	with	flats	above	them.	Even	as	he	looked around,	the	street	cleared:	the	shop	owners	closed	and	locked	their	doors,	men and	women	practically	ran	to	get	out	of	the	area.	There	was	no	use,	though;	two platoons	of	National	Guardsmen	blocked	the	intersections.	No	one	would	be coming	or	going	for	some	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Larry	Harris	approached	from	his	vehicle. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“It	does,	doesn’t	it.	Well,	let’s	get	this	show	on	the	road.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	around	and	looked	at	his	men.	“Listen	up!	You	know	what	to	do.	Men who	meet	the	suspect	profile	are	to	be	detained;	we’ll	gather	them	over	here	to put	them	on	the	buses.

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">September	12</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	rain	rattled	against	the	canvas	roof	of	Karen	Greenfield’s	HUMMWV	like popcorn,	loud	enough	that	she	couldn’t	hear	the	radio.	The	air	had	turned	cold from	the	rain,	and	the	inside	of	the	humvee	smelled	like	sweat	and	mildew.	Her soaked	Kevlar	vest	didn’t	help,	as	moisture	seeped	through	it	and	her	olive-drab raincoat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	tanks	were	in	position,	four	of	them	stationed	at	the	intersections	around	the Capitol	Building.	A	few	blocks	away,	her	executive	officer	was	positioning	the remainder	of	the	company	in	the	Little	Cairo	neighborhood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since	she’d	been	with	the	company,	they’d	been	activated	three	times.	The	first two	didn’t	require	weapons,	they	were	to	deal	with	floods.	Then,	last	year,	they briefly	deployed	to	Morgantown	after	a	riot.	In	that	case	they	stood	around	and did	guard	duty,	much	as	she	expected	to	do	here.	In	no	case	was	the	use	of	main battle	tanks	required. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	men	inside	the	tanks	would	be	miserable;	unable	to	cover	the	tank	with	a tarp,	they’d	be	sitting	inside	what	amounted	to	great,	leaking	tin	cans,	getting soaked.	She’d	never	understood	how	they	could	make	a	tank	that	could	survive the	direct	hit	of	a	125mm	sabot	round,	but	couldn’t	design	one	that	didn’t	leak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	head	over	to	Little	Cairo,”	she	said	to	her	driver. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Corporal	Stanson,	who	sat	behind	the	wheel	blowing	on	his	hands	to	warm	them, bobbed	his	head.	“Yes,	ma’am.”	He	put	the	vehicle	in	gear	and	drove,	faster	than she	liked;	it	was	still	light,	but	with	the	rain,	visibility	was	down	to	less	than	fifty meters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	Little	Cairo,	the	twenty-four	men	were	positioned	at	eight	intersections.	As she	approached	the	position	closest	to	the	federal	building,	she	saw	two	of	the men	setting	up	shelter	halves	against	the	wall	of	a	building	as	the	third	stood guard	duty	in	the	driving	rain.	The	one	on	guard	duty	was	Private	Campbell, from	up	the	road	just	outside	Highview.	At	seventeen,	a	senior	at	Highview	High School,	the	Guard	required	him	to	get	permission	from	his	parents	before	he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p195"></a>enlisted. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Damn. </i>	She	couldn’t	stay	inside,	not	when	the	guys	were	outside	in	the	rain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stepped	out	of	the	somewhat	warm	HUMMWV	into	the	icy	downpour.	It didn’t	soak	through	her	plastic	wet-weather	jacket	immediately,	but	it	would soon	enough.	She	walked	through	the	rain	to	Campbell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ma’am.”	He	was	shivering	and	his	teeth	chattered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	soon	as	they’ve	got	that	shelter	up,	you	get	under	it,	okay,	Campbell.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	nodded	vigorously,	and	little	droplets	of	rain	flew	off	his	chin.	“Yes,	ma’am.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	started	to	turn	away,	but	he	spoke	again.	“Ma’am,	can	I	ask	you	a	question?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,	Campbell,”	she	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lightning	struck	nearby,	and	the	light	flashed	in	their	eyes,	followed	by	a	loud crack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ma’am,	in	your	briefing	you	said	we	was	here	to	protect	the	Arab	folks	here against	being	attacked	and	stuff,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	braced	herself,	half	expecting	to	hear	an	argument	against	the	mission	of protecting	the	neighborhood.	“Yes,	that’s	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well	see,	that’s	the	thing,	ma’am.	When	you	go	around	that	corner,	you’ll	see what	I’m	talking	about.	Bunch	of	guys	in	sunglasses	and	whatnot	are	rounding up	a	lot	of	folks.	Banging	down	doors	and	stuff,	ma’am.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	away,	and	then	steeled	his	resolve.	“I	know	we’re	here	to	support	the DHS,	but	it	just	don’t	look—it	don’t	look_	American_	to	me,	ma’am,	if	you	take my	meaning.	Looks	like	more	of	the	same	as	the	Saturn	plant,	ma’am.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	eyes	narrowed.	“Thanks.	I’ll	have	a	look,	Campbell.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bracing	herself,	she	walked	on	through	the	rain.	As	she	reached	the	corner, Stanson	followed	her	in	the	humvee. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p196"></a>Sitting	in	the	open	rain,	soaked	and	miserable,	hands	cuffed	behind	their	backs,	a group	of	fifteen	men	and	boys	who	appeared	to	be	Arabs	sat	with	their	backs against	a	shop	window.	A	man	with	an	automatic	rifle	stood	guard	over	them.	He wore	a	black	raincoat	with	the	letters	DHS	emblazoned	on	the	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	other	men	kicked	in	a	door	about	fifty	feet	away.	They	were	covered	by	a third,	this	one	armed	with	a	rifle.	A	woman	screamed	in	a	foreign	language,	and then	she	heard	indistinct	male	voices	shouting.	One	of	the	agents	shoved	a woman	out	of	his	way,	roughly.	A	moment	later	the	two	armed	men	came	out, dragging	a	fourteen-year-old	boy	between	them.	He	struggled,	terror	on	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	threw	him	to	the	ground	and	one	knelt	on	the	boy’s	back	while	the	other cuffed	him	with	plastic	ties.	They	unceremoniously	dumped	him	with	the	other prisoners. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	face	tightened.	It	was	him.	The	son	of	a	bitch	who	killed	David	Firkus, Agent	Ben	Matley.	He	was	one	of	those	under	investigation	by	the	Harpers	Ferry DA,	and	they	had	the	stupidity	to	bring	him	here	and	allow	him	to	treat American	citizens	like	cattle.	Shoving	women	and	kids	around	like	they	didn’t matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	on	her	goddamn	watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	marched	back	to	Corporal	Stanson,	who	still	sat	in	the	humvee.	He	unzipped his	plastic	window	and	leaned	out	to	hear	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Call	the	platoon	leaders;	have	them	move	the	men	to	the	edge	of	the intersection	where	they	can	see.	I	may	need	some	backup;	I’m	putting	a	stop	to this.	And	call	Major	Elkins	right	away.	Tell	him	what’s	happening,	then	catch	up with	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ma’am,	I	don’t	think	that’s	a	good	idea.”	His	eyes	were	wide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	the	Army	wants	your	ideas,	Corporal,	they’ll	promote	you	to	Captain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Until	then,	you	follow	orders.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	ma’am.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	scrambled	for	the	radio. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	turned	around.	Half	a	block	down,	parked	in	the	center	of	the	street,	sat	two</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p197"></a>bland-looking	sedans;	lights	flashing	behind	their	grilles.	Two	men	stood	at	the cars,	one	talking	on	the	phone.	She	recognized	one	of	them:	Agent	Lawrence Harris.	He’d	been	at	the	Saturn	Plant	as	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	walked	toward	the	cars	as	lightning	struck	again,	bathing	the	entire	scene	in garish	white	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	is	in	charge	here?”	she	demanded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	on	the	phone	lowered	his	handset.	Short,	in	his	late	forties,	he	dressed in	the	same	black	raincoat	as	the	others,	his	head	covered	by	a	black	baseball cap,	and	a	small	earpiece	in	his	ear.	He	looked	up	at	her	and	eyed	the	railroad track	insignia	on	her	helmet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am,	Captain.	Special	Agent	Hagarty.	I	was	told	to	expect	a	National	Guard company	to	assist	our	efforts.	I’ve	already	seen	the	men	on	the	perimeter.	Good job.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	Captain	Greenfield.	Those	are	my	men	on	the	perimeter.	What’s	going	on here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	gathering	material	witnesses	in	our	investigation	of	the	bombing	this morning.	They’ll	be	taken	into	custody	and	questioned.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Material	witnesses?	Looks	to	me	like	you’re	grabbing	every	male	over fourteen!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	right.	Anyone	who	meets	our	profile.	They’ll	be	released	once	we’ve established	they’re	clear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Hagarty,	this	has	to	stop	right	now.	What	you’re	doing	isn’t	right,	and	it’s not	legal.	You	can’t	just	round	up	people	and	cuff	them	and	carry	them	away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty	frowned	at	the	challenge	and	his	chin	jutted	out.	“I	most	certainly	can, Captain.	I	strongly	urge	you	to	mind	your	own	business	and	leave	me	to	mine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	clenched	her	teeth	and	fists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hagarty,	I	don’t	care	what	your	business	is.	Mine	is	to	protect	and	defend	the Constitution	of	the	United	States,	and	you	are	treading	all	over	that.	I	want	you</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p198"></a>to	do	three	things	right	now:	release	those	men	and	boys	over	there,	gather	up your	men,	and	get	the	hell	out	of	here.	Someone	else	can	deal	with	investigation, someone	who	understands	this	is	still	America.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	approached	until	they	stood	a	foot	apart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	glanced	back.	Six	of	her	men	and	two	of	her	lieutenants	approached,	along with	Corporal	Stanson.	All	nine	of	the	men	were	armed.	They	gathered	in	a loose	group	between	her	and	the	humvee.	Just	twenty	feet	away,	they	were difficult	to	see	in	the	driving	rain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	heard	another	door	crash	in,	screams	from	inside.	Agents	came	out	with	two men	between	them,	a	teenager	and	his	father.	Both	were	handcuffed.	Karen signaled	to	Lieutenant	Carson	to	approach.	He	ran	up	to	her,	and	she	pointed directly	at	the	agents	who	had	just	exited	the	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lieutenant,	I	want	you	to	take	three	of	the	men,	go	over	there	and	free	those two	men,	then	the	others	lined	up	on	the	sidewalk.	If	necessary,	you	are authorized	to	take	these	so-called	federal	agents	into	custody.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carson	looked	stunned	by	the	orders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty	spoke.	“Lieutenant,	this	operation	was	authorized	by	the	President	of the	United	States,	who	I	believe	you	swore	an	oath	to	obey.	If	you	follow	that order	you	will	suffer	the	consequences.	I’ll	see	you	both	court-martialled.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hagarty,	you	have	no	legal	standing	to	round	up	people	in	the	streets	and	arrest them,	nor	to	threaten	an	officer	under	my	orders.	You	are	committing	a	grave crime	here,	sir.	I	won’t	stand	for	it	and	neither	will	my	men.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lieutenant	Carson	nodded,	swallowing.	For	just	a	second	he	appeared	to	waver, then	his	jaw	set. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	got	it,	ma’am.”	He	turned	back	to	the	men.	“Billings.	Cole.	Wilson.	Over	here, on	the	double.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Lieutenant	and	the	three	soldiers	approached	the	stunned	agents,	weapons ready.	The	agents	looked	back	and	forth	between	the	approaching	soldiers	and Agent	Hagarty,	jaws	slack. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p199"></a>“Lay	your	weapons	on	the	ground	right	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	agents	started	to	raise	his	hands	in	the	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty	screwed	his	face	up,	red	with	rage.	“Goddamn	it,	don’t	listen	to	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	reached	out	and	shoved	Karen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	fell	back	a	step,	then	straightened.	By	the	time	she	regained	her	balance, Hagarty	was	staring	down	the	barrel	of	Corporal	Stanson’s	M-16A2	rifle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	better	keep	your	hands	to	yourself,	Mister.”	Stanson’s	voice	was	steady. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	took	a	breath,	adrenaline	pumping	into	her	system.	They	were	at	a	stalemate, as	her	men	and	the	federal	agents	stood	with	weapons	leveled	at	each	other.	She had	to	calm	the	situation	down	before	it	got	out	of	control. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	let’s	keep	it	cool.	Everybody	lower	your	weapons.”	She	raised	her hands	in	a	gesture	to	stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately,	that	was	when	lightning	struck	with	a	crack	and	a	flash	of	light.	It only	took	that	moment	for	the	whole	thing	to	go	to	hell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	know	who	fired	the	first	shot,	but	heard	it	clearly,	the	crack	of	a	rifle, immediately	after	the	lightning	strike.	The	second	bullet	hit	Karen	square	in	the middle	of	her	Kevlar	vest.	She	spun	to	the	ground,	her	vision	going	black. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Above	her,	she	heard	a	burst	of	shots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	no.”	She	struggled	to	her	feet.	Her	hands	were	scraped	bloody	from	her landing.	She	pushed	herself	up	and	her	vision	cleared.	Rainwater	poured	off	her helmet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty	lay	on	the	ground,	blood	pumping	out	of	a	hole	in	his	neck,	mixing	with the	half-inch	deep	water	on	the	pavement.	One	of	her	men	writhed	on	the ground,	screaming,	his	knee	shattered	by	a	bullet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cease	fire,	goddammit,”	she	tried	to	shout,	but	she	couldn’t	get	her	breath.	She tried	again.	“Cease	fire!  <i class="calibre3">Cease	fire! </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	tried	to	make	sense	of	the	situation.	Two	or	three	DHS	agents	were	crouched in	the	doorway	of	an	apartment	building,	rifles	out.	They	huddled	down,	trying</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p200"></a>to	stay	out	of	the	line	of	fire.	She	saw	a	muzzle	flash.	The	air	stank	of	the	acrid smell	of	gunpowder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	men	and	boys	apprehended	by	the	DHS	were	still	on	the	sidewalk.	Bound by	plastic	cuffs,	they	tried	to	get	out	of	the	line	of	fire	as	small	arms	continued	to go	off	around	them.	One	boy,	who	couldn’t	have	been	older	than	fourteen, squirmed	underneath	a	car,	and	the	plate	glass	window	behind	the	men	shattered from	a	bullet.	The	man	guarding	them	ducked	behind	the	car,	little	more	than	his rifle	showing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind	her,	her	own	men	fired	from	behind	the	HUMMWV,	and	several	more ran	forward	from	their	positions	on	the	perimeter.	Corporal	Stanson	lay	on	the ground,	and	a	pool	of	blood	stained	the	rainwater	around	him.	Blood	pumped from	the	center	of	his	chest—he	wasn’t	wearing	his	vest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	face	was	white	and	his	arms	flapped	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mama!”	he	screamed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cease	fire!”	She	waved	her	arms.	“Cease	fire!	Cease	fire	 <i class="calibre3">now! </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	head	jerked	to	the	left	as	a	bullet	glanced	off	her	helmet.	It	knocked	her	to the	ground	again.	Then,	miraculously,	the	firing	stopped,	and	she	could	hear nothing	but	the	rain	slap	into	the	pavement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	took	a	breath,	then	another.	The	DHS	men	stared	out	from	their	positions, shock	on	their	faces.	She	glanced	behind	her.	Her	own	soldiers	were	just	as bewhildered. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Oh,	God, </i>	her	head	hurt.	She	stood,	one	hand	on	her	neck,	where	sharp	pain radiated	from	a	pulled	muscle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You.”	She	pointed	at	Larry	Harris,	one	of	the	only	agents	she	recognized.	“Take your	men	and	move	over	to	the	other	side	of	the	intersection.	I	don’t	want	any goddamn	arguments.	And	call	for	ambulances,	right	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	turned	around.	“Lieutenant	Carson,	call	the	medics.	Lieutenant	Gavin,	pull our	men	on	a	line	behind	the	position	of	the	humvee.	And	have	someone	cut those	men	loose.”	She	pointed	at	the	prisoners. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p201"></a>She	dropped	to	her	knees	and	crawled	over	to	Hagarty	and	ripped	open	her	first aid	pack,	removed	a	bandage	and	placed	it	on	his	neck.	The	bandage	instantly stained	red,	the	blood	seeping	through	the	cloth	and	between	her	fingers	and	out onto	the	pavement.	Her	hands	shook	as	she	tried	to	stop	the	blood.	God,	she could	smell	the	blood,	there	was	so	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	need	help	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	of	her	men	ran	up,	as	well	as	Agent	Harris.	She	glared	at	him,	then	looked away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Help	Stanson,”	she	told	her	men.	Corporal	Stanson	had	stopped	moving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You,”	she	said	to	Harris.	“Lift	him	up	enough	so	I	can	get	this	bandage	around him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	nodded,	his	face	pale.	Quickly,	she	wrapped	the	tails	underneath	the	opposite armpit	from	his	wound	and	tied	if	off	as	tight	as	she	could.	It	might	as	well	not have	been	there;	blood	still	poured	steadily	from	the	wound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Best	I	can	do.	He	won’t	make	it	if	we	don’t	get	an	ambulance	right	away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harris	looked	up	and	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	you,	don’t	I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	glared	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	you	do.	You	killed	my	friends	and	neighbors	in	Highview.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Confusion	clouded	his	eyes,	and	then	he	recognized	her.	His	eyes	widened.	She stood	up	and	walked	away.	As	she	approached	her	humvee,	she	shook. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stanson	lay	there,	the	medics	trying	to	save	him.	They	covered	the	sucking	chest wound	with	a	plastic	bag	and	wrapped	him	with	bandages.	Blood	had	splattered six	feet	away	from	him	as	he	struggled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	had	she	done?	Oh,	God,	look	at	him.	She	could	hear	an	echo	in	her	mind: <i class="calibre3">When	the	Army	wants	your	ideas,	Corporal,	they’ll	promote	you	to	Captain. </i> __</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p202"></a>Those	were	just	about	the	last	words	he’d	heard. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Morris	found	the	battalion	headquarters,	in	a	tent	across	the	street	from	the collapsed	federal	building.	He	took	a	deep	breath,	then	pushed	his	way	into	the dark	tent	and	took	off	his	helmet,	rainwater	splashing	to	the	ground.	Barksdale stood	in	front	of	the	map	with	three	other	officers;	they	turned	to	Morris	as	he entered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Morris,	come	on	over.	We’re	going	over	the	dispositions.”	Barksdale	said, waving	Morris	over.	The	officers	looked	up	at	the	sound	of	small-arms	fire, faint,	but	clear,	a	group	of	high	pitched	pops.	Morris	thought	it	sounded	like	a mixture	of	pistol	shots	and	automatic	rifle	fire.	Given	the	rain,	it	couldn’t	be more	than	a	few	blocks	away.	Barksdale	actually	ducked	down	a	little	at	the sound,	and	his	eyebrows	squeezed	together.	Morris	reminded	himself	Barksdale had	served	in	combat	three	times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	the	hell	is	that?”	one	of	the	officers	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More	shots,	a	lot	of	them.	Sounded	like	at	least	a	dozen	people	with	automatic weapons.	Most	of	the	shots	came	in	the	clear,	almost	signature	three-round	burst of	an	M16A2	rifle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Those	are	M16’s,”	said	Barksdale.	“Morris,	is	your	company	close	or	did	you come	ahead	of	them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right	behind	me,	sir;	they’re	less	than	two	minutes	away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	then,	you	get	the	assignment.	Find	out	who’s	shooting,	and	deploy your	platoons	across	this	area	to	screen	the	federal	building.	It’s	close,	whatever it	is.	Remember,	we	can’t	arrest	anyone.	Just	assess	the	situation	and	report back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris,	winded	from	his	sprint	back	to	his	company,	laid	a	laminated	map	on	the hood	of	a	car	and	motioned	for	his	platoon	leaders	to	gather	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p204"></a>“All	right.	Fourth	and	fifth	platoons,	position	yourselves	here	and	here.	You	will provide	a	screening	force	for	the	area	around	the	federal	building.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	pointed	out	the	positions	on	the	map	and	gave	the	platoon	leaders	time	to mark	their	own	maps	with	grease	pencils. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“First,	second,	and	third	platoons	come	with	me;	we’ll	split	into	three	columns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Advance	on	these	three	streets,	and	stay	on	line	with	each	other.	Find	out	where the	shots	came	from.	As	soon	as	we	find	it,	we	assess	the	situation	and	report	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again,	stay	on	line	as	we	move	forward,	but	move	quickly.	Brief	your	squad leaders;	we	go	in	two	minutes.	Rules	of	engagement:	lock	and	load,	but	fire	only if	you	have	been	engaged	and	cannot	withdraw.	If	you	are	fired	on,	hunker	down and	we’ll	assess	the	situation.	Questions?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	platoon	leaders	looked	unhappy	with	the	rules	of	engagement,	but	didn’t	ask any	questions.	Morris	didn’t	like	them	either,	but	no	one	got	to	pick	their mission.	They	weren’t	in	some	third	world	city:	they	had	to	be	extra	careful	of the	civilians	in	the	area.	Two	minutes	later	the	company	broke	up	into	platoons and	advanced	rapidly	through	the	city.	The	rain	continued	to	pour	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	scanned	doorways	and	windows,	accompanying	second	platoon.	The streets	were	quiet—most	of	the	downtown	businesses	were	closed	today	because of	the	bombing.	The	gutters	rattled	and	rain	ran	down	them	into	the	sewers below.	His	men	ran	up	the	street	as	in	a	combat	zone,	covering	each	other carefully.	Each	fire	team	covered	its	counterpart	as	they	sprinted	forward, leapfrogging	each	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Halfway	up	the	second	block,	a	woman	in	a	suit	stepped	out	of	a	door	and	saw	a group	of	soldiers	bounding	toward	her.	She	screamed	and	ducked	back	into	the doorway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris’	radio	let	out	a	burst	of	static,	and	he	heard	Sergeant	Miller’s	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Black	six,	this	is	red	four.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	black	six,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Black	six,	you	better	come	to	our	position.	We’ve	found	where	the	shooting came	from.	We’ve	got	wounded	over	here;	there’s	been	a	pretty	nasty	firefight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p205"></a>“On	the	way.	Has	your	platoon	taken	fire?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	turned	to	his	second	platoon	leader.	“Lieutenant,	form	a	perimeter	at	the next	intersection	and	wait	for	my	orders.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	relayed	similar	instructions	to	third	platoon,	then	jogged	eastward	to	Miller’s position.	Despite	the	cold	and	rain,	sweat	rolled	off	him.	At	sixty	pounds,	he carried	a	light	load	for	an	infantryman,	but	it	was	still	pretty	damn	heavy,	and	he wasn’t	twenty-two	any	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	winded	when	he	reached	Miller’s	position.	Sergeant	First	Class	Kevin Miller	was	his	most	experienced	sergeant,	and	had	served	multiple	combat	tours in	Iraq	and	Afghanistan,	among	others.	Six	foot	three,	with	a	shrapnel	scar across	his	forehead	that	stood	out	against	his	dark	brown	skin,	he	was	an imposing	man	who	kept	an	incredibly	tight	platoon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller’s	men	were	in	positions	on	either	side	of	the	road,	covering	in	all directions.	A	block	ahead,	a	HUMMWV	and	a	Crown	Vic	with	a	nest	of antennas	blocked	the	street,	facing	each	other.	A	second	Crown	Vic,	pockmarked with	bullet	holes,	sat	at	the	curb	about	thirty	feet	away.	The	whine	of approaching	ambulances	could	be	heard	over	the	rain.	As	he	approached	the scene	with	Miller,	two	soldiers	immediately	broke	away,	a	female	Captain	and	a sergeant.	From	across	the	street	a	man	in	a	DHS	raincoat	also	approached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	came	to	a	dead	stop	when	he	realized	that	the	woman	who	walked	toward him,	blood	stains	spattered	across	her	uniform,	was	Karen	Greenfield,	whom	he hadn’t	seen	in	seven	years.	Even	covered	in	blood	and	sweat,	a	scarred	helmet on	her	head,	she	still	looked	beautiful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jesus	Christ,”	he	murmured	to	his	XO,	Derek	Hutchison,	“What	the	hell happened	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	she	approached,	the	officers	exchanged	salutes.	It	felt	strangely	formal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Karen.”	For	some	reason,	saying	her	name	made	him	want	to	cry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	she	looked	back	at	him,	her	face	was	so	impassive	he	didn’t	think	she recognized	him	at	first. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p206"></a>“Mike	Morris.”	She	spoke	in	a	monotone	when	she	said	his	name,	but	became more	animated	when	she	continued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,	we	need	your	help	right	now.	Ambulances	aren’t	here	yet;	we’ve	got several	wounded	up	here.	Can	you	send	up	your	medics?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	turned	to	Sergeant	Miller.	“Sergeant,	send	Corporal	Woods	up,	and	Hall from	first	platoon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.”	Miller	turned	away	and	shouted	to	his	platoon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	happened	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	shrugged.	“The	feds	were	rounding	up	people	on	the	street,	knocking down	doors	house	to	house.	It	was	a	gross	violation	of	civil	rights.	We	ordered them	to	stop,	but	it	turned	ugly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jesus,	Karen.	You	got	in	a	firefight	with	the	DHS?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded	slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	never	would	have	guessed,	not	in	a	million	years.	Jesus,	did	you	get	hit? </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’ve	got	a	hole	in	your	flak	vest.	And	your	helmet—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	pointed	to	the	deep	furrow	carved	in	the	side	of	the	helmet,	above	her	right ear.	“God,	if	that	had	been	an	inch	to	the	right	it	would	have	killed	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shrugged.	“I’ve	got	wounded	men	over	there;	I	don’t	have	time	to	worry about	myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Karen—how	have	you	been?”	He	spoke	in	a	low	tone,	not	quite	a	whisper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	response	was	cold.	“Captain,	I’ve	got	work	to	do.	Why	don’t	you	look	me up	in	a	day	or	two?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	waiting	for	an	answer,	she	turned	and	walked	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hutchison	spoke.	“You	know,	sir,	that’s	what	happens	when	you	put	women	in the	combat	arms.	Gets	to	be	their	time	of	the	month,	and	they	go	crazy.	Can	you believe	that?	Shooting	at	the	DHS—they	must	be	crazy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p207"></a>Morris	turned	and	looked	at	Hutchison.	“Shut	up,	Lieutenant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hutchison	froze.	“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Minutes	later,	Major	Vince	Elkins	roared	up	in	his	Hummer,	sending	a	wave	of rainwater	splashing	up	onto	the	sidewalk.	The	vehicle	had	barely	stopped	before he	jumped	out	and	marched	toward	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain,	I	need	a	report,	right	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir.”	She	paused,	almost	stumbled	from	exhaustion.	“I	observed	a	serious crime:	federal	agents	were	assaulting	the	civilian	residents,	rounding	them	up and	arresting	them.	I	ordered	them	to	stop,	and	the	situation	got	out	of	control. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I…	I	take	full	responsibility,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elkins’s	eyes	flicked	across	the	street	to	the	DHS	men,	back	over	to	the	wounded National	Guardsmen,	then	to	the	bullet	hole	in	her	flak	vest	and	the	scar	on	her helmet.	It	took	him	about	five	seconds	to	make	the	decision	she	expected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain,	you	are	relieved	of	your	command.	Wait	for	me	in	the	Hummer	while	I sort	this	out.	Where	is	your	executive	officer?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right	over	there,	sir.”	She	pointed,	hating	the	tremor	in	her	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lieutenant	Britton,	report	to	me	this	instant!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	sat	in	the	back	seat	of	the	Hummer	and	rested	her	head	in	her	hands.	What could	she	have	done	differently?  <i class="calibre3">No. </i>	No	matter	what	happened	in	the	end, whether	this	ended	her	military	career	or	landed	her	in	prison,	she’d	made	the right	decision.	She’d	had	to	stop	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen’s	conviction	wouldn’t	be	much	consolation	to	Sherry	Stanson	when	she found	out	her	husband	was	dead.	She	stifled	a	sob. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside,	Major	Elkins	spoke	with	Morris	and	another	Lieutenant	Colonel, probably	Morris’s	battalion	commander,	along	with	Agent	Harris.	Elkins	was waving	his	hands	as	he	spoke.	She	supposed	they	were	working	out	a	new security	plan—for	sure	the	National	Guard	couldn’t	stay	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p208"></a> <i class="calibre3">God	damn	it. </i>	Was	she	supposed	to	just	stand	there	and	let	it	happen? </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	point	in	wasting	any	more	time.	She	pulled	out	her	pocket	computer	and unfolded	the	keyboard.	Time	to	compose	her	report. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	rain	continued	to	pour	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">An	hour	later,	Karen	stared	straight	ahead	as	she	gave	a	more	detailed	verbal report	to	Elkins	and	Colonel	Murphy	at	the	makeshift	battalion	headquarters	in the	basement	of	the	State	Capitol.	Murphy,	still	wearing	civilian	clothing,	stared intently	at	Karen	as	she	described	the	day’s	events.	As	she	spoke,	part	of	her	felt like	the	little	girl	she’d	once	been,	explaining	a	mistake	to	her	unpredictable	and dangerous	father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	his	phone	rang.	He	examined	the	number	it	displayed,	flipped	it	open	and answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Murphy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	heard	a	panicky	voice	on	the	phone,	though	she	couldn’t	make	out	the words.	Whoever	it	was	sounded	hysterical,	and	Murphy’s	response	was	forceful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Slow	down,	Valerie,	there’s	no	need	to	get	excited	at	this	point.	Yes,	it’s	true. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	in	Charleston	now;	I	just	got	in	a	few	minutes	ago.	Actually,	you	can	do something	for	me.	Talk	to	Representative	Clark.	My	understanding	is	that	the DHS	was	going	house	to	house,	kicking	down	doors	and	arresting	all	of	the teenagers	and	men,	with	no	regard	to	whether	or	not	they	had	anything	to	do with	anything.	My	men	got	caught	in	the	middle	when	they	intervened.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	paused	to	listen,	and	then	spoke	again.	While	he	spoke,	Karen	looked down	at	the	scuffed	tile	floor	and	wondered,	again,	if	there	was	any	way	she could	have	handled	the	situation	without	betraying	her	principles. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Face	it. </i>	She	hadn’t	done	it	on	principle.	She’d	done	it	out	of	anger.	It	was	her first	gut	reaction	on	seeing	the	bastard	who’d	killed	Dave	Firkus.	Now	two	men were	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	a	lot	better,	hon.	Better	than	he’s	been	in	a	long	time.	I	really	think	this</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p209"></a>treatment	is	helping.	Your	Grandma’s	with	him,	she’s	going	to	stay	in	Ohio while	I’m	on	alert.	Listen,	I’m	in	a	meeting,	hon.	Let	me	know	what	you	find out…	Love	you	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	folded	up	the	phone	and	looked	at	Karen,	his	expression	kind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	met	his	eyes	and	her	stomach	twisted.	It	was	like	looking	at	her	father, except	she	had	far	more	respect	for	Murphy.	What	the	hell	was	he	going	to	say? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	irony	was,	never	in	her	life	had	she	cared	about	her	father’s	approval.	The thought	of	Murphy’s	disapproval—that	terrified	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Am	I	going	to	end	up	in	prison	because	of	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	if	I	can	help	it,”	Murphy	said.	“Captain,	your	actions	were	rash,	and	you should	have	consulted	with	me	or	Major	Elkins	before	you	acted.	That’s	where you	went	wrong.	Very	wrong.	You	may	lose	your	command	because	of	this, maybe	your	commission.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	held	her	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	fact	is,	though	you	acted	without	authority,	I	believe	you	took	the	correct action	under	the	circumstances.	What	happened	at	the	federal	building	this morning	not	withstanding,	this	is	still	America,	we	still	have	a	Constitution	and you’ve	sworn	to	defend	it.	I’ll	back	you	up,	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tears	clouded	her	eyes,	but	she	blinked	them	back	savagely.	She	wasn’t	going	to cry	in	front	of	them.	Not	a	chance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	sir.”	Her	voice	was	almost	a	whisper. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Thank	God. </i>	But,	blinking	her	eyes,	she	could	still	see	Corporal	Stanson	on	the ground,	the	blood	pumping	out	of	his	chest	turning	the	rainwater	red,	screaming for	his	mother	as	he	died. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here’s	the	bad	news.	I	want	to	get	you	out	of	the	line	of	fire	immediately.	That means	that,	temporarily,	I’m	going	to	relieve	you	of	your	command.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen’s	stomach	twisted.	It	must	have	shown,	because	Murphy	spoke	quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain,	look	at	me.	I	meant	what	I	said.	I	will	back	you	up.	But	we	need	to	get</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p210"></a>you	where	you	won’t	be	in	everybody’s	line	of	fire,	because	I	guarantee	you before	the	day	is	out,	the	federal	government	will	come	gunning	for	you.	I’ve	got to	move	quickly	if	we’re	going	to	be	able	to	protect	you.	In	the	meantime,	you’ll move	over	to	the	battalion	S-3,	which	will	be	some	good	staff	training	for	you anyway,	and	for	the	duration	of	this	deployment	to	Charleston,	Lieutenant	Antal will	take	over	your	company.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trying	to	hide	her	disappointment,	she	replied,	“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Vince,	where	are	my	uniforms?	I	have	to	go	see	General	Peak.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Murphy	walked	away,	Karen	stared	at	the	floor,	wondering	just	what	the	hell she	was	going	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p211"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	Nineteen</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">September	12</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Representative	Albert	Clark	tried	not	to	squirm	as	the	woman	applied	foundation to	his	forehead.	He	sat	in	a	barber’s	chair,	weaving	a	little	from	exhaustion, bright	lights	trained	on	him	as	she	worked.	She	was	approaching	sixty,	about	ten years	Clark’s	senior,	with	long	gray	hair	parted	in	the	middle	and	down	behind her	shoulders.	She	wore	a	wicked	grin	as	she	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Congressman,	you’ve	aged	since	last	time	you	were	on.	Everything	all	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	be	just	fine	if	you	run	away	with	me,”	Clark	grinned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed	and	slapped	him	on	the	shoulder.	“You	congressmen	are	all	the same,	always	thinking	in	your	pants.	Get	on	out	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	thanked	her	and	stood;	then	an	aide	led	him	into	the	studio.	Mark	Skaggs	was already	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Skaggs	stood	when	he	saw	Clark.	They	shook	hands,	and	then	sat	down	facing each	other	on	opposite	sides	of	a	small	coffee	table.	Skaggs	wore	a	custom-fit suit	with	a	bright	red	tie.	Very	slick.	Clark	knew	others	didn’t	share	his	view: Skaggs	had	won	lopsided	victories	in	his	district,	and	was	well	respected	on	the Hill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mark,	how	are	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	just	keep	on	keeping	on,	Albert,”	Skaggs	replied.	“It	has	been	quite	a	year, hasn’t	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	it	has.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sixty	seconds,”	someone	shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bill	Warner,	the	moderator	for	Washington	Talk,	charged	onto	the	set.	Clark	and Skaggs	both	stood.	“Good	afternoon,	gentlemen.	Are	we	ready?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p212"></a>They	shook	hands	all	around	and	sat.	Warner’s	aftershave	was	so	strong	it	made Clark’s	eyes	itch,	and	he	wore	so	much	makeup	he	looked	like	a	corpse,	though that	wouldn’t	show	up	on	screen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lights	came	up	and	washed	them	in	light	bright	enough	that	Clark	wanted	to shade	his	eyes.	He	could	just	see	Valerie	through	the	studio	window,	pacing	back and	forth,	talking	on	the	phone.	A	young	man,	twenty	or	so,	approached	Clark and	stumbled	into	his	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,”	he	muttered,	then	pinned	a	wireless	microphone	on	Clark’s	lapel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	counted	down	from	ten.	When	they	reached	one,	the	studio	went	silent, and	then	Warner	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	America.	This	is	Bill	Warner	with	Washington	Talk.	Today	we	have	with us	representatives	Albert	Clark	of	West	Virginia	and	Mark	Skaggs	of	Kentucky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’re	talking	about	the	Fiscal	Responsibility	Act	today,	but	first,	the	news	on the	forefront	of	everyone’s	mind:	After	a	terrorist	bombing	in	West	Virginia;	this afternoon	saw	a	violent	shootout	between	the	National	Guard	and	the Department	of	Homeland	Security.	Gentlemen,	thank	you	for	being	on	the	show today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	and	Skaggs	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Early	this	morning	terrorists	destroyed	the	federal	building	in	Charleston,	West Virginia.	Now,	the	federal	authorities	say	they	have	a	suspect,	one	Brian Ibrahim,	a	25-year-old	Iraqi	American.	Are	there	any	updates	on	this,	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	Bill,	I	have	to	correct	you	on	one	thing.	The	DHS	is	investigating,	but they	haven’t	named	Mr.	Ibrahim	a	suspect.	My	office	has	done	some	checking: Mr.	Ibrahim	was	a	decorated	veteran,	and	worked	as	a	security	guard	while going	to	college	on	the	GI	Bill.	All	that	makes	him	a	suspect	is	the	fact	he	was	in the	building.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Skaggs	interrupted.	“He	was	from	Iraq;	that	makes	him	a	suspect	right	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	shook	his	head.	“No,	he	was	not	from	Iraq,	he	was	from	Detroit.	He	was born	in	the	United	States	and	was	a	US	citizen,	and	our	understanding	is	his parents	fled	Iraq	because	they	were	supporters	of	the	failed	rebellion	against	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p213"></a>Iraqi	government.	All	I’m	saying,	gentlemen,	is	that	we	need	to	take	our	time and	not	prematurely	point	fingers.	This	man	wasn’t	allowed	to	see	a	priest	before he	died,	even	though	he	specifically	asked	for	one.	Is	this	who	we	want	to	be?	It is	this	very	kind	of	speculation	that	fueled	the	stupid	move	by	the	Department	of Homeland	Security	today,	which	is	an	irredeemable	tragedy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Warner	moved	to	take	control	of	the	conversation	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gentlemen,	let’s	turn	to	our	second	topic.	In	a	second	incident	today,	Homeland Security	officials	were	fired	on	by	members	of	the	West	Virginia	National Guard.	Two	men	were	killed	and	another	four	injured.	We’ve	just	gotten	word the	attorney	general	plans	to	prosecute	Captain	Karen	Greenfield,	the commander	of	the	National	Guard	unit.	Any	comments	on	this	incident,	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Skaggs?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	Bill.	If	the	incident	occurred	as	the	media	has	reported,	Captain	Greenfield ought	to	be	given	a	medal.	It’s	a	terrible	thing	people	died	in	this	incident,	and	I lay	the	blame	for	that	squarely	on	the	DHS.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Warner	raised	his	eyebrows,	and	his	face	turned	a	shade	of	red	under	the makeup.	“But	isn’t	it	a	crime	to	interfere	with	federal	officers	conducting	an investigation?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	leaned	forward	to	listen	closely.	He	and	Skaggs	were	so	often	on	opposite sides	of	every	issue,	he	found	it	hard	to	imagine	they	agreed	on	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,	it	is,	and	she’ll	likely	be	charged	with	obstruction	of	justice	and	murder, as	well.	But	think	about	it	for	a	second.	The	reports	so	far	indicate	the	DHS	was kicking	in	doors	and	dragging	men	and	teenagers	out	of	their	homes.	None	of this	was	based	on	an	investigation,	they	just	went	down	there	because	the suspect	was	Iraqi	and	lived	in	that	neighborhood.	At	the	least,	we	need	to	have an	independent	investigation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Warner	took	that	moment	to	jump	in.	“I	think	many	people	will	disagree	with your	point	of	view	on	this,	Congressman.	The	Department	of	Homeland	Security is	our	defense	against	terrorism,	and	according	to	the	latest	polls,	most Americans	agree	they	are	willing	to	trade	some	of	their	civil	liberties	for security.	What	say	you,	Representative	Clark?	It’s	your	state	that	was	hit	by terrorists.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p214"></a>Clark	leaned	forward.	“I	think	most	Americans	would	disagree	if	the	polls	didn’t ask	questions	in	a	very	limited	way.	In	West	Virginia,	people	have	been	very unhappy	with	the	long	reach	of	the	federal	government	in	recent	years.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Warner	responded,	“Are	you	suggesting	this	Dale	Whitt	person	has	the	correct answer?	Secede	from	the	United	States?	Most	Americans	think	he’s	a	crackpot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	not,”	Clark	said.	“I’ve	served	the	United	States	my	entire	adult	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	it	would	be	foolish	to	dismiss	him	out	of	hand.	What	I’m	suggesting	is,	he has	tapped	into	a	strong	current	of	dissatisfaction	on	the	part	of	ordinary	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Americans	may	be	afraid,	but	not	just	of	terrorists.	They	are	afraid	of	their	own government.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Warner	raised	his	eyebrows	in	an	exaggerated	look	of	surprise.	“You	mean	to	tell me	you	both	agree	on	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	looked	at	Skaggs	and	they	both	chuckled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Skaggs	spoke.	“Apparently	we’ve	found	some	common	ground,	Bill.	Mr.	Clark is	right—at	least	about	this.	We’ve	abandoned	some	of	our	fundamental principles.	Dale	Whitt	may	be	a	fruitcake,	but	he’s	awakened	a	lot	of	very	angry people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Warner	interrupted	as	Skaggs	took	a	breath.	“Well	thank	you,	gentlemen.	Our regular	viewers	will	recognize	we	have	a	first	today:	Mr.	Clark	and	Mr.	Skaggs agree.	The	question	is:	are	they	both	right,	or	are	they	both	wrong?	When	we come	back,	we’ll	talk	about	something	they	won’t	agree	on:	the	Fiscal Responsibility	Act,	scheduled	for	debate	in	the	House	tomorrow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Three	minutes,”	someone	called. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Skaggs	leaned	back,	a	grin	on	his	face.	“You	know,	Al,	we	should	consider	a	bill to	cut	DHS’s	funding,	or	cut	their	activities	way	back.	We	could	introduce	it together.	That	would	turn	some	heads.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	nodded.	“Not	bad.	Let’s	get	our	folks	to	set	up	a	meeting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sixty	seconds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	they	spoke,	Warner	shouted	at	one	of	his	assistants.	Clark	and	Skaggs	ignored</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p215"></a>it	and	continued	talking—Bill	Warner	was	jovial	on	screen,	but	well	known	as	a terror	for	his	staff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	they’re	going	to	crucify	that	Captain,”	Skaggs	said.	“If	the	Justice Department	doesn’t	get	her,	the	Army	will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	bobbed	his	head.	“Didn’t	you	hear?	The	attorney	general	is	calling	for	the death	penalty.	It’s	appalling.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ten	seconds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	silent	as	the	lights	came	back	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Welcome	back,	America,	this	Bill	Warner	with	Washington	Talk.	We’re	here today	with	Mark	Skaggs	of	Kentucky,	and	Albert	Clark	of	West	Virginia,	who are	behaving	with	unusual	harmony	this	afternoon.	Gentlemen,	you’ll	hurt	my ratings	if	you	keep	this	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	and	Skaggs	chuckled	politely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,	for	the	big	issue.	The	Senate	passed,	fifty-four	to	forty-three,	a companion	bill	to	the	Fiscal	Responsibility	Act	last	Monday.	Here	we	have	the original	author	and	sponsor	of	the	bill,	Representative	Skaggs.	Mr.	Skaggs,	the house	is	scheduled	to	debate	this	tomorrow	morning.	What	are	the	prospects	for it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	Bill,	we’re	pretty	confident.	I	don’t	expect	the	debate	to	be	much	fun,	but we’ll	get	there—despite	all	the	special	interest	money	that’s	come	into	this debate,	we’ll	do	the	right	thing	and	pass	the	bill.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Clark?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bill,	this	is	the	same-old	same-old.	We’ve	passed	massive	corporate	tax	cuts,	to the	tune	of	tens	of	billions	of	dollars,	in	the	past	few	years.	At	the	same	time we’ve	fought	half-a-dozen	foreign	wars.	Now,	big	surprise,	we’re	on	the	verge	of bankruptcy.	So	we’re	going	to	go	after	the	weakest	parts	of	our	society.	We’re talking	about	cutting	many	benefits	for	the	disabled,	for	wounded	veterans,	in fact	for	just	about	everyone	who	is	not	a	multi-millionare.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Warner	spoke.	“But	it	isn’t	it	true	the	General	Accounting	Office	investigation</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p216"></a>you	requested	found	many	of	the	programs	are	rife	with	abuse?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	that’s	not	true.	It	did	conclude	there	was	some	abuse—as	there	is	with	any government	program.	The	vast	majority	are	people	who	will	be	in	serious trouble	without	some	assistance.	Families	will	become	homeless.	People	will	die from	untreated	diseases.	This	won’t	just	be	a	problem	for	those	individuals—it’ll be	a	problem	for	our	entire	society.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Warner	grimaced.	“Dire	predictions,	Congressman.	Do	you	offer	an	alternative?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	do.	For	the	last	four	years	running	I’ve	been	introducing	a	bill	that	will	make measured	cuts	in	defense,	means	test	social	security,	cut	corporate	subsidies,	and ensure	the	poor	children	in	our	society	don’t	get	left	behind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Skaggs,	what	say	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bill,	Congressman	Clark	is	well	intentioned,	and	I’m	sure	he’s	sincere,	but	he misses	the	point.	Social	Security	is	not	some	government	program	you	can	use	to hand	out	benefits	willy-nilly,	based	on	your	preferences.	People	pay	into	the system.	They	get	money	out.	Simple.	Second,	he	suggests	the	tired	old	mantra	of the	Democrats:	raise	taxes.	We	can’t	raise	taxes	anymore,	the	backs	of	our people	are	broken.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Warner	interrupted.	“According	to	yesterday’s	Washington	Post,	over	two million	layoffs	have	been	reported	this	year.	Are	we	headed	into	another recession?	Mr.	Clark?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	we	ever	leave	the	last	one?	We’ve	gone	off	the	edge	of	a	cliff	and	we’re busy	cutting	the	strings	off	our	parachute.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Skaggs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	you	can	call	it	a	recession	yet.	I	do	know	in	my	district	we’ve	got rising	unemployment.	The	people	in	my	district	are	worried,	and	that	is	why	I’ve made	many	of	the	proposals	included	in	the	Fiscal	Responsibility	Act.	If	we can’t	get	the	federal	government’s	house	in	order,	how	can	we	help	the economy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	all	we	have	time	for,	gentlemen.	You’ve	got	ten	seconds	to	get	in	the	last word.	Mr.	Clark.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p217"></a>“We’d	be	crazy	to	pass	this	so-called	Fiscal	Responsibility	Act,	especially	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	going	to	hurt	a	lot	of	people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Skaggs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Government	spending	must	be	brought	under	control.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Warner	looked	at	the	camera.	“And	that’s	it	for	Washington	Talk.	Join	us	next week	for	more	discussion	of	current	Washington	events.	This	is	Bill	Warner, your	host,	with	our	guests	Congressmen	Mark	Skaggs	and	Albert	Clark.	Thank you	for	joining	us,	and	have	a	great	day.	That’s	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lights	dimmed,	and	Clark	and	Skaggs	stood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Should	be	an	interesting	day	tomorrow,	Al.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	it	will	be.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	shook	hands	with	Warner	and	with	each	other;	the	production	assistants removed	their	microphones;	then	they	parted	in	opposite	directions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Clark	walked	away,	Valerie	approached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	White	House	called.	The	President	wants	to	see	you	at	six	tomorrow morning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	arrived	at	the	Governor’s	office	at	7:30	a.m.	the	morning	after	the bombing.	He	wore	his	dress	uniform,	with	rank	and	insignia	displayed.	After twenty	years	in	the	West	Virginia	National	Guard,	he	had	never	met	the Governor	in	person,	much	less	been	asked	to	breakfast	with	both	the	Governor and	the	commanding	general.	At	the	door	he	paused	and	adjusted	his	tie—except for	the	hearing	in	early	summer,	it	had	been	a	year	since	he’d	worn	his	dress uniform,	and	the	collar	was	too	tight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	opened	the	door.	Inside	was	a	spacious	entry,	with	rich	dark	paneling	and	a polished	marble	floor.	A	brown	leather	couch	and	chairs	lay	off	to	the	side.	The Governor’s	secretary	was	behind	a	maple	desk,	talking	on	the	phone	and	typing at	the	same	time.	She	looked	up	as	he	walked	into	the	room	and	asked	her	caller</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p218"></a>to	hold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Colonel	Murphy,	the	Governor	is	expecting	you.	You	can	go	on	back.”	She indicated	the	door	next	to	her	desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	ma’am.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	walked	to	the	door,	knocked	once,	and	then	opened	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Major	General	Harris	Peak	and	Governor	Frank	Slagter	sat	at	a	small	polished table	to	the	side	of	the	Governor’s	office,	eating	breakfast	next	to	a	window	that overlooked	downtown.	Unfortunately,	the	window	perfectly	framed	the devastated	federal	building	and	its	surroundings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Governor,	still	chewing,	waved	with	his	knife	for	Murphy	to	sit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">General	Peak	spoke	first.	“Good	morning,	Colonel	Murphy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	morning,	sir;	Governor.”	Murphy	sat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter	belched	into	his	fist,	then	spoke.	“Colonel	Murphy,	it’s	a	pleasure	to	meet you.	General	Peak	has	spoken	well	of	you	for	years;	I’m	surprised	we	never	had the	opportunity	to	meet	in	person.	Here,	have	some	coffee.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">General	Peak	put	down	his	cup. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Murphy,	we	called	you	here	for	two	reasons.	We’ll	take	care	of	the	easy	one first,	how	does	that	sound?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	smiled,	not	knowing	what	to	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Governor	called	out,	“Sophie,	send	in	the	photographer	please.”	He	then stood,	and	waved	at	Murphy.	“Come	on	over	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	young	man	in	his	early	twenties	entered,	high-end	digital	camera	in-hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	recognized	the	model;	it	was	one	he	wanted	to	buy	a	couple	of	years ago	to	help	feed	his	photography	hobby,	but	the	price	had	been	too	high. </p>
<p class="calibre1">General	Peak	walked	around	the	table.	“Let’s	do	it	against	the	wall	over	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p219"></a>You’ll	get	the	best	light	for	the	photo	that	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter	agreed.	“That	sounds	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	was	bemused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stand	at	attention,	Lieutenant	Colonel,”	Peak	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Colonel,”	Slagter	said.	“I’d	like	to	be	the	first	to	congratulate	you	on	your promotion.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Promotion! </i>	He	hadn’t	even	been	on	the	list.	All	the	same,	Peak	pulled	from	his pocket	a	small	plastic	bag	containing	two	silver	eagles	of	a	full	Colonel,	and pinned	them	on	Murphy’s	lapels,	removing	the	leaf	of	a	Lieutenant	Colonel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	nice	thing	about	being	in	the	National	Guard,	Colonel,”	Slagter	said,	“is that	you	don’t	have	to	wait	for	the	Army	or	Congress	to	approve	your	promotion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	can	do	that.	We	need	more	men	of	courage	like	you	in	the	top	ranks,	Colonel Murphy.	I’m	certain	you	will	do	credit	to	the	Guard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	General	Peak	was	pinning	the	silver	eagles	the	photographer	took	a photograph,	and	then	another	as	Slagter	shook	Murphy’s	hand.	Murphy	had	to stop	a	wave	of	sudden	sadness;	at	his	last	promotion,	Martha	had	been	beside him.	God,	would	it	never	stop	hurting? </p>
<p class="calibre1">General	Peak	followed	Slagter	back	to	his	seat.	“Now,	down	to	business.	We’re making	a	couple	of	organizational	changes.	Colonel	Wilkins	has	retired, effective	immediately,	and	I’d	like	you	to	take	command	of	First	Brigade, reporting	directly	to	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brigade	Commander.	The	Brigade	headquarters	was	in	Morgantown,	about	an hour’s	drive	from	Highview. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	isn’t	that	a	full-time	position?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is.	Do	you	want	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	took	a	deep	breath,	his	mind	racing	over	the	implications.	A	full-time</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p220"></a>position	in	the	Guard	meant	health	insurance	again,	it	meant	help	for	Kenny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And,	everything	else	aside,	he	loved	being	an	officer.	The	chance	to	command	a Brigade…	He’d	have	never	thought	it	would	happen.	“Yes,	sir,	I	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,	good.	Governor,	I	told	you,	Colonel	Murphy	is	just	the	man	for	the	job. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Do	you	know	during	his	battalion’s	rotation	to	the	National	Training	Center,	they did	as	well	against	the	OPFOR	as	any	active	duty	unit	ever	does?	Remarkable, when	you	consider	how	little	time	they	have	to	train.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Indeed.”	Slagter	took	a	sip	of	coffee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll	have	to	call	your	brother	and	brag.	Now	he’s	not	the	only	brigade commander	in	the	family.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	smiled.	“Tommy	is	too	humble	for	bragging	to	do	any	good,	General.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter	looked	at	them,	his	head	cocked	slightly,	and	Peak	explained.	“Colonel Murphy’s	brother	Tom	commands	a	brigade	of	the	101st	Air	Assault	at	Fort Campbell.	Didn’t	they	just	get	back	from	the	Middle	East?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About	six	months	ago,	General,	in	February.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy’s	gaze	slipped	from	the	white	table	cloth,	the	bright	orange	juice,	the coffee,	to	the	devastation	just	outside	the	window.	A	plume	of	smoke	still	rose from	the	scene	of	the	federal	building,	and	from	here	he	could	see	the	flashing	of hundreds	of	lights	down	there,	the	area	still	surrounded	by	emergency	vehicles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	about	sitting	up	here	in	this	rarified	atmosphere,	chatting	and	looking at	the	destruction	below—it	just	didn’t	seem	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well	Colonel,”	said	General	Peak.	“That	brings	us	our	second	task.	We	have	to decide	what	to	do	with	that	Captain	of	yours.	I’ve	got	some	ideas,	but	I’d	like	to hear	yours	first.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	looked	first	at	the	General,	than	at	the	Governor.	He	had	known	Peak for	years,	but	he	couldn’t	predict	what	the	General	would	do	in	this	situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	would	have	only	one	chance	to	persuade	them	not	to	abandon	Karen Greenfield. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	I	don’t	believe	we	have	a	choice.	The	way	I	see	it,	Captain	Greenfield	had two	imperatives.	First,	her	standing	orders,	which	were	to	maintain	law	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p221"></a>order	in	her	area	of	operations.	We	explicitly	gave	her	that	order.	Second,	she operated	under	her	oath	as	an	officer,	sir,	which	requires	her	to	protect	and defend	the	Constitution.”	Murphy	took	a	deep	breath.	“I	suspect	I	may	lose	this discussion,	but	my	opinion	is	we	must	back	her	up.	She	did	the	right	thing,	by protecting	the	rights	of	the	civilians	in	the	area.	If	she	hadn’t,	she	would	have been	complicit	in	a	serious	crime.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peak	frowned	and	spoke,	his	voice	sharp.	“Colonel,	are	you	suggesting	that	a firefight	with	federal	police	in	the	street	is	maintaining	law	and	order?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Governor	held	his	palm	out	to	General	Peak	and	said,	“Wait,	please. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Colonel,	please	go	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	cut	his	eyes	to	General	Peak,	whose	face	was	tense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	I	would	recommend	you	take	two	steps.	First,	acknowledge	in	public	she did	the	right	thing.	Second,	I’d	order	an	investigation	into	DHS.	I’d	refuse	to turn	her	over	to	the	federal	government	until	that	investigation	is	complete.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter	and	General	Peak	glanced	at	each	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Governor	Slagter	spoke	first.	“That’s	close	to	my	own	opinion,	Colonel.	General Peak	sees	things	differently.	Let’s	hear	your	reasoning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	took	a	deep	breath.	“Sir,	you’ve	got	a	couple	of	issues	to	think	about here.	The	first	one	is	that	it’s	clear	to	me	that	the	Department	of	Homeland Security	is	way	out	of	bounds—you’ve	had	several	West	Virginia	citizens	killed in	the	last	few	months,	none	of	them	in	clear	or	clean	arrests.	They	sent	in armored	vehicles	and	helicopters	to	deal	with	a	labor	dispute—this	in	a	case where	the	owner	of	the	plant	was	a	personal	friend	of	the	President.	Now	this, smashing	in	doors	and	dragging	kids	out	in	the	street	to	be	tied	up	and	left	in	the rain.	Sir,	it’s	not	just	inappropriate,	or	unconstitutional.	It’s	repressive.	It’s	like something	you	would	have	heard	about	in	Iraq	or	Jerusalem	ten	years	ago,	sir,	or Russia	thirty	years	ago.	If	you	don’t	speak	out,	who	will? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“People	outside	West	Virginia	look	at	Dale	Whitt	and	they	see	a	crackpot,	sir. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	he	has	touched	on	a	level	of	anger	and	frustration	I	would	never	have guessed	at,	and	I	don’t	know	if	it	can	be	kept	in	hand.	But	sir,	you	can	keep	this from	going	too	far,	by	insisting	constitutional	limits	still	apply.	If	people	see	you going	out	on	a	limb	to	protect	them	from	the	federal	government,	they	are	far</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p222"></a>less	likely	to	follow	a	radical	path	like	Whitt’s.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter	grunted	and	frowned	at	the	mention	of	Whitt.	“My	advisors	tell	me	there is	no	chance	Whitt’s	measure	will	make	it	on	the	ballot.	What	do	you	think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	answered.	“Sir,	I	think	he’s	already	got	enough	signatures.	The	question in	my	mind	is	whether	or	not	it	will	actually	pass.	If	it	does,	sir,	you’ll	have	a very	serious	problem	to	deal	with.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	inconceivable	to	me.	The	citizens	of	this	state	wouldn’t	vote	for	it.	It’s insane.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	it	seems	to	me	if	many	more	incidents	like	yesterday	occur,	they	just	might. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Look	out	your	window.	Do	you	really	believe	some	college	kid	on	the	GI	bill	did that?	Someone	who	was	conveniently	Iraqi?	I	don’t.	No	offense	to	anyone,	but	if this	was	a	serious	attempt	at	a	major	terrorist	incident,	they	would	have	done	it in	the	day	and	killed	a	few	hundred	people.	Instead,	it	was	in	the	dead	of	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	federal	building	was	destroyed,	but	there	were	very	very	few	casualties.	I think	this	was	done	by	a	local	who	wanted	to	hurt	the	feds	only.	The	DHS	is barking	up	the	wrong	tree	by	rounding	up	Arab	families.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter	grimaced	and	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	believe	you’re	right,	Colonel.”	He	paused	and	looked	out	at	the	plume	of smoke	rising	from	the	center	of	the	city,	then	spoke	again,	his	gaze	far	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	need	to	get	on	top	of	this.	If	we	can	just	keep	the	feds	from	doing	anything else	really	stupid	between	now	and	election	day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	nodded.	One	more	incident	might	push	them	over	the	edge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">General	Peak	spoke.	“Well,	Colonel,	tell	Captain	Greenfield	we	won’t	hang	her out	to	dry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter	stood.	“Murphy,	be	prepared	to	come	back	here	for	a	press	conference later	today.	I’ll	send	someone	around	to	get	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.”	Murphy	stood	when	Slagter	did.	It	was	clear	he	was	being	dismissed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	sir—thank	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p223"></a>“All	right,	Colonel.	You	can	get	back	to	your	troops,	we	won’t	keep	you	any longer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ride	back	to	the	State	Capitol	and	Murphy’s	battalion	headquarters	was quick.	Now	it	would	be	Major	Elkins’s	battalion.	Picking	up	his	pace,	he	walked to	the	headquarters	and	entered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Corporal	Harris	stood	guard	outside	the	door,	holding	an	M16	rifle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harris	came	to	attention	as	Murphy	approached,	then	reached	to	his	side	and opened	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	called	out	“Attention!”	as	Murphy	entered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	you	were,”	Murphy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	returned	to	what	they	were	doing.	At	the	map	table,	Karen	stood	with Lieutenant	Antal	reviewing	paperwork.	Dark	circles	framed	her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir.”	Karen	paused	and	took	a	breath	as	she	noticed	the	silver	eagles	on	his lapels.	“Congratulations.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	Captain.	Do	you	have	a	moment?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you	will	excuse	us,	Lieutenant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,	and	congratulations.”	Antal	walked	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Karen,	I	wanted	to	let	you	know	I	just	met	with	the	Governor	and	with	General Peak.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.”	He	saw	a	tremor	in	her	hands,	very	slight.	She	clenched	her	hands	into fists	and	the	tremor	vanished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Governor	says	he’ll	back	you	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p224"></a>“This	doesn’t	mean	you	are	out	of	the	woods	yet,	but	it’s	a	lot	better	than	I expected.	We’ll	just	have	to	see	it	through.	Have	you	had	any	sleep?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	I	keep	asking	myself	if…	if	there	was	something	else	I	could	have	done…</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Something. </i>	Corporal	Stanson	is	dead,	sir,	and	it…	It	was	my	fault.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cut	the	crap,	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	jerked	at	the	harsh	words,	looked	at	him	startled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Karen,	part	of	being	an	officer	is	you	have	to	make	the	hard	decisions.	The	kind of	decisions	civilians	wouldn’t	dream	of	making,	the	kind	that	can	save	a	life	or take	one.	And	you	have	to	live	with	those	decisions.	I’ll	tell	you	now,	if	you make	a	lifetime	of	this,	it	won’t	be	the	last	time	you’ll	have	to	make	this	kind	of decision.	Do	you	understand?	You	could	tear	yourself	up	with	doubts,	wondering what	you	could	have	done.	Learn	from	the	mistakes	you	make,	and	move	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fact	is	you	made	your	decision	to	protect	innocent	bystanders.	You	did	your job.	You	can’t	spend	your	life	second-guessing	what	might	have	been	if	it	had gone	differently;	you’ll	drive	yourself	crazy.	Trust	me	on	this—I	know	what	I’m talking	ahout.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded,	her	eyes	watering.	“Sir,	I	was	up	all	night,	working	on	a	letter	to	his wife.	Stanson…	He’s	got	a	two-year-old	daughter,	sir.	They	came	to	the company	picnic	last	spring,	right	before	all	this	started.	I	don’t	know…	I	don’t know	what	to	tell	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	her	the	truth.	Her	husband	died	defending	the	citizens	of	this	country.	She has	every	right	to	be	proud	of	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded,	but	he	could	still	see	the	doubt	on	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	look	convinced.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	be	all	right,	Colonel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Make	sure	you	are	more	than	all	right,	Captain.	Your	men	depend	on	you	when you	get	out	there.	Doubts	are	natural,	and	the	fact	that	you	have	them	makes	you a	better	officer.	But	remember,	it	can	be	more	dangerous	for	you	to	hesitate	than to	make	the	wrong	decision.	You’re	a	good	officer.	All	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p225"></a>“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.	I	need	to	take	a	walk	around	and	talk	to	the	troops.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	and	walked	to	the	door.	At	the	door,	he	paused	and	spoke	to	Corporal Harris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen,	Corporal.	If	any	federal	agents	show	up	here—FBI,	DHS,	whatever—</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	are	to	refuse	them	entry.	Make	it	clear	I	gave	the	order	and	have	me	notified immediately.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	I’m	depending	on	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Corporal	Harris,	still	standing	guard	duty	at	the	door,	stuck	his	head	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ma’am?”	It	was	clear	who	he	was	asking	for,	because	Karen	was	the	only woman	in	the	headquarters.	“You’ve	got	a	Captain	Morris	here	to	see	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	what	she	needed.	Mike	Morris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	turned	around.	“Send	him	in,	Corporal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	ma’am.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harris	stepped	back	from	the	door	and	Mike	Morris	entered.	He	wore	his camouflage	uniform	and	web	gear,	with	a	pistol	at	his	hip	and	his	k-pot	under	his arm.	He	looked	at	her,	his	expression	unreadable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi,	Mike.”	She	realized	the	headquarters	had	become	unusually	quiet.	She	was subject	to	scrutiny	of	everyone	in	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	at	the	others,	eyes	narrowing.	References	to	her	being	a	woman	were off-limits.	Her	first	year	in	the	unit	she’d	been	besieged	by	requests	for	dates from	the	other	officers.	She	had	fended	them	off,	and	after	a	few	months	the pursuit	was	called	off.	It	had	been	a	long	time	since	anyone	had	treated	her</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p226"></a>differently	because	of	her	gender. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lieutenant	Antal,	this	seems	like	a	good	time	to	grab	some	lunch.	I’ll	meet	you back	here	at	1300	hours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	ma’am,”	the	Lieutenant	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	walked	out	of	the	headquarters	with	Morris	behind	her,	and	led	him	down	a dim	basement	corridor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t	go	outside,	the	press	is	out	there,	and	probably	the	FBI,	so	we’ll	have	to make	do	here.	How	are	you,	Mike?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	been	worse.	It	looks	like	I’m	in	for	a	career,	I’ve	got	an	infantry	company now,	First	of	the	Fifteenth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	your	family?”	She	hoped	her	tone	wasn’t	too	stiff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Savannah	is	a	wonderful	little	girl—she’s	the	light	of	my	life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	good	for	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	happening	with	you,	Karen?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	until	recently	I	was	working	for	Saturn	Microsystems.	But	I’ve	been	laid off,	and	relieved	of	my	command.	The	justice	department	just	announced	they’re going	to	throw	the	book	at	me—capital	punishment,	no	less.	It’s	been	an interesting	summer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	at	her,	eyes	wide.	“I	hadn’t	heard	about	the	Justice	Department.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	on	the	radio	a	little	while	ago.	The	attorney	general	himself	made	the announcement.	‘We’re	going	to	catch	that	rogue	National	Guard	captain	and	try her	for	capital	murder	while	committing	a	felony.’	The	felony	is	obstruction	of justice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	tone	sounded	bitter,	even	to	herself.	“They	are	actually	charging	 <i class="calibre3">me</i>	with obstruction	of	justice.	Like	the	DHS	was	doing	anything	resembling	justice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jesus,	Karen.	What	are	you	going	to	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p227"></a>She	laughed	sadly.	“I	guess	I	can’t	stay	in	the	basement	forever.	I’m	told	that	in	a little	while	the	Commanding	General	of	the	West	Virginia	Guard,	as	well	as	the Governor,	will	go	out	there	and	refuse	extradition.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	a	mess.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	it	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mike	stared	at	her,	and	his	expression	softened.  <i class="calibre3">Asshole. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	look	at	me	like	that,	you	son	of	a	bitch.	You	made	your	goddamn	choice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’re	married	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	not	exactly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	the	hell	is	‘not	exactly’	married?	Is	that	like	‘almost	pregnant?’	‘Sort	of’</p>
<p class="calibre1">dead?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	away.	“Karen,	would	you	believe	me	if	I	told	you	leaving	you	was	the biggest	mistake	I	ever	made	in	my	life?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	grimaced.	“Of	course	leaving	me	was	your	biggest	mistake,	bonehead.	I could	have	told	you	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	always	loved	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	Christ.	You	show	up	now	after	seven	years	and	look	at	me	that	way?	You can’t	do	that,	Mike.	I’ve	got	my	own	life	now;	I	don’t	need	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	closed	his	eyes	and	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look.	I	don’t	need	to	complicate	my	life.	I’ve	got	more	than	enough	problems of	my	own.	I	could	really	use….”	Her	voice	broke,	and	she	savagely	blinked back	tears,	then	spoke	again.	“I	could	really	use	a	friend	right	now.”	Then	she laughed.	“Well,	that	and	a	good	lawyer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	reached	for	her	and	they	embraced.	It	had	been	a	long	time,	and	having	his arms	around	her	felt	right.  <i class="calibre3">This	is	a	mistake. </i>	She	shouldn’t	be	standing	here	with Mike	Morris,	of	all	people.	But	back	when	she’d	first	started	college,	a	lost	and confused	almost-orphan,	he’d	been	there.	Enough	of	a	similar	background	that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p228"></a>he	wasn’t	alien—after	all,	he’d	grown	up	less	than	a	hundred	miles	from	her.	But completelty	different	from	her	father	and	most	of	the	other	men	she’d	known	in her	life.	Self-centered,	yes,	but	never	aggressive	or	angry.	They’d	clicked,	and had	a	wonderful	four	years	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he’d	dropped	it	like	a	bomb	that	he	was	leaving,	breaking	her	heart.	Right now,	she	didn’t	care.	It	felt	so	good	to	be	held	for	a	change,	she	just	didn’t	care. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p229"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	Twenty</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">September	13</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	Clark	drove	his	ancient	Ford	through	the	gate	at	the	south	entrance	of	the Ellipse	after	the	military	police	completed	their	search.	He	drove	to	the designated	spot,	and	then	walked	to	the	iron	gate	of	the	White	House,	where	the guards	searched	him	again.	Inside,	he	was	X-rayed.	This	was	Clark’s	fifth	visit to	the	White	House	in	ten	years,	though	the	first	three	were	to	this	President’s predecessor.	Each	time	the	security	was	a	little	tighter,	and	the	perimeter	of restricted	areas	around	the	White	House	a	little	wider. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	still	remembered	when	people	held	demonstrations—or	walked	their	dogs—</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	Lafayette	Park	or	on	the	Ellipse.	When	they	could	stand	outside	the	fence	of the	White	House	and	take	photographs	from	three	or	four	hundred	yards	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	that	matter,	when	he’d	first	come	to	Washington	as	a	twenty-two-year-old Senate	aid	during	the	Clinton	administration,	Pennsylvania	Avenue	was	still open	to	vehicular	traffic.	Oklahoma	City	stopped	that.	Today,	it	would	take	a telescopic	lens	to	shoot	the	same	photograph,	the	parks	on	both	sides	were closed,	and	Pennsylvania	Avenue	was	closed	from	14th	to	18th	streets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	least	the	Secret	Service	agent	who	escorted	him	into	the	official	residence above	the	West	Wing	was	polite,	commenting	that	Clark	was	very	early;	the	sun wasn’t	up	yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark’s	answer	was	quick.	“You	don’t	turn	down	a	breakfast	invitation	from	the President.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though	Clark	had	visited	the	White	House	before,	those	were	official	visits	in the	West	Wing.	He’d	never	seen	the	inside	of	the	residence	upstairs,	and	was impressed	with	its	size	and	spaciousness.	Any	sense	of	opulence	was	offset	by the	lack	of	privacy,	however.	Even	in	sleep,	the	occupants	of	this	residence	were never	alone,	never	unwatched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	agent	escorted	him	to	a	small	room.	President	Wendell	Price	sat	at	a	table, along	with	Congressman	Mark	Skaggs.	Clark	thought	the	two	of	them	couldn’t contrast	with	each	other	more:	Price	big	and	tall,	his	presence	filling	every	room he	entered;	Skaggs	slight,	thin	and	reserved.	They	sat	at	a	table	overflowing	with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p230"></a>food.	In	the	corner	of	the	room	stood	a	large	man,	250	pounds	or	more,	in	a black	suit.	It	must	be	like	living	in	a	fishbowl,	surrounded	by	the	Secret	Service twenty-four	hours	a	day.	Or	was	that	one	more	sign	of	power	for	Price	to	relish? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	in,	Mr.	Clark.	Sit	down,	have	breakfast.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	Mr.	President,”	Clark	responded,	and	sat	in	the	third	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	should	try	this	orange	juice,	Mr.	Clark.	Do	you	know	these	oranges	are grown	in	my	hometown,	Land-o-Lakes,	Florida?	Someone	actually	ships	them up	here	regularly	so	I	have	a	taste	of	home	every	morning.	It	reminds	me	it’s only	two	more	years	and	I’ll	be	free.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll	be	reelected	for	sure,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	see.	This	is	the	worst	job	in	the	world,	Al.	Can	I	call	you	Al?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can	call	me	Mr.	President.”	Price	and	Skaggs	chuckled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	forced	a	polite	laugh.  <i class="calibre3">All	right, </i>	he	thought.  <i class="calibre3">You’ve	had	your	little	joke,	Mr. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">President. </i>	Like	a	couple	of	little	piglets	oinking	at	each	other.	There	was	no	such thing	as	a	purely	social	visit	for	the	President,	and	Clark	wished	he	would	get down	to	business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mark	here	tells	me	the	two	of	you	agreed	on	something	on	television	yesterday. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	shocked.	That’s	why	I	invited	the	two	of	you	to	breakfast—I	figured	if both	of	you	agree	on	something,	it	must	be	exciting	news.	This	is	a	first,	so	far	as I	know.	Is	that	right,	Mark?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Skaggs	nodded,	wiping	his	mouth	with	a	napkin,	then	spoke.	“Yes,	sir.	I	believe Al	and	I	have	been	on	opposite	sites	of	the	fence	of	just	about	every	vote	we’ve ever	had.	Although	there	have	been	some	unanimous	votes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	those	don’t	count.	Let	me	guess—one	designated	March	14	as	National Spelling	Bee	day?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	pretended	to	laugh	again,	in	spite	of	his	discomfort. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p231"></a>“So	tell	me	about	this	thing	you	agree	on,	Mr.	Clark.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Back	to	Mr.	Clark	now. </i> Clark	took	a	deep	breath,	then	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	somehow	I	expect	you	won’t	like	what	I’ve	got	to	say.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	all	right,	Mr.	Clark;	if	both	you	and	Mr.	Skaggs	agree,	it	must	have	some merit.	Besides,	this	is	a	democracy—all	our	opinions	are	equally	important.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">But	some	are	more	equal	than	others,	right,	Mr.	President? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	President,	I’m	sure	you’ve	been	briefed	on	events	in	Charleston.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	President	nodded	and	shoved	a	forkful	of	eggs	into	his	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	the	attorney	general	announced	he	is	planning	to	prosecute	the	National Guard	captain	involved	in	that	incident.	His	decision	is	misguided,	sir.	The	DHS</p>
<p class="calibre1">team	broke	the	law.	Captain	Greenfield	responded	as	her	training	and professionalism	dictated:	she	acted	to	protect	the	citizens	in	her	area	of responsibility.	My	understanding	is	she	tried	to	talk	it	out	with	the	head	of	the DHS	team,	Agent</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagarty,	but	he	refused	to	listen	and	physically	shoved	her,	which	escalated tensions	between	the	two	groups.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Price	scowled.	“You	understand	they	killed	a	federal	agent.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.	And	you	understand	your	agents	killed	a	National	Guardsman,	a	young man	from	my	district?	Let	me	be	clear,	Mr.	President.	I	did	a	little	bit	of	digging recently.	In	the	last	year	the	DHS	has	been	involved	in	over	30	incidents	in which	people	were	killed,	and	not	one	of	them	verifiably	involved	a	terrorist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Four	of	those	occurred	in	my	state,	sir.	We’ve	got	a	situation	of	seething discontent	in	West	Virginia,	sir,	discontent	over	the	federal	government’s involvement	in	people’s	day-to-day	affairs.	Discontent	over	lack	of	privacy,	and especially	over	regulation	of	everything	under	the	sun.	You	need	to	understand, sir,	most	West	Virginians	are	ready	to	vote	for	that	idiotic	referendum.	This	is	as serious	as	it	can	get,	Mr.	President.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Price	rolled	his	eyes.	“Come	now.	The	last	reports	I	have	is	they	can’t	even	get many	signatures,	and	the	ones	they	had	were	destroyed	in	a	fire.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p232"></a>“Mr.	President,	it	sounds	like	your	intelligence	may	not	be	up	to	date.	The signatures	were	destroyed	in	the	fire,	but	that	event	was	a	catalyst.	I’m	told	they already	have	enough	signatures	to	get	it	on	the	ballot,	and	will	deliver	them today.	Understand,	sir—a	local	police	officer	was	killed	that	day	saving	a	little girl’s	life,	because	the	DHS	stormed	in	and	conducted	a	raid	the	floor	above	a day	care	center.	If	you	had	planned	it,	sir,	you	couldn’t	have	found	a	way	to infuriate	the	citizens	of	West	Virginia	more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	corners	of	Price’s	mouth	twitched—he	must	have	been	annoyed	to	be reminded	of	DHS’s	spectacular	screw	up.	“I’m	well	aware	of	the	incident, Congressman.	The	Department	is	conducting	an	investigation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	are	you	aware	of	any	incident—ever—when	the	Department	has investigated	itself	and	found	anything	wrong?	Sir,	if	you	prosecute	Captain Greenfield—especially	if	you	try	to	have	her	executed—it	will	push	the	state over	the	edge.	Nobody	wants	that,	sir.	Nobody.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Skaggs	leaned	forward,	his	eyes	rapt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	President	spoke	again.	“Mr.	Clark,	whatever	does	that	mean?	Will	West Virginia	declare	its	independence?	That’s	impossible	to	believe	in	this	day	and age.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	shook	his	head.	“Sir,	I	can’t	imagine	it	would	go	that	far.	But	it’s	only unthinkable	today	because	the	Civil	War	was	so	brutal	secession	became unthinkable.	To	the	voters	in	my	state,	that’s	beyond	ancient	history.	It	might was	well	be	something	that	happened	in	Rome	two	thousand	years	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	you	people	see	the	benefits	you	get	from	the	federal	government?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	with	all	due	respect,	what	benefits?	We’ve	run	the	statistics.	For	every federal	tax	dollar	that	leaves	West	Virginia,	we	get	fifteen	cents	back.	For	the	last three	years—ever	since	the	latest	economic	slide	began—our	newspapers	have been	full	of	stories	covering	these	issues.	My	people	are	boiling,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	President	shrugged	and	put	up	his	hands	in	a	surrendering	gesture.	“All right,	Mr.	Clark.	I	get	it.	What	do	you	want	me	to	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Reconsider	the	decision	to	try	Karen	Greenfield.	Or	at	least	take	the	death penalty	off	the	table.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p233"></a>Price	shook	his	head	just	slightly.	“You	know	I	can’t	do	that.	The	Justice Department	is	an	independent	agency.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	you	know	as	well	as	I	do	that’s	been	a	fiction	for	decades.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Price	looked	at	Clark,	his	brows	creased.	“Let’s	just	say	you’re	right,	and	I	can drop	the	prosecution.	I’ve	got	big	problems	too,	Mr.	Clark.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Here	it	comes, </i>	Clark	thought.  <i class="calibre3">What’s	the	tradeoff? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	give	you	an	example,	Mr.	Clark.	I	run	a	government	bleeding	red	ink	right now.	We’re	in	debt	up	to	our	ears,	the	deficit	is	getting	worse,	and	it’s	getting	to a	point	where	we	can’t	even	pay	for	our	national	defense.	You’re	well	aware we’ve	pulled	most	of	our	troops	out	of	Central	Asia	in	the	last	couple	of	years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	make	a	big	show	about	that	being	a	strategic	decision,	but	it’s	not.	It’s	a financial	decision.	It	costs	too	much	to	maintain	bases	all	over	the	planet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Price	paused	and	took	a	sip	of	his	coffee,	set	the	cup	down	with	a	clink,	then took	another	forkful	of	eggs.	He	chewed	thoughtfully	for	a	moment,	followed	it with	a	sip	of	orange	juice—home	grown	in	Florida,	as	he’d	pointed	out.	It	was all	a	charade	to	show	Clark	who	was	running	the	show.	He	was	surprised	they hadn’t	left	him	cooling	his	heels	outside	when	he	got	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	was	I?	Right.	We’re	bankrupt.	Now	we’re	spending	millions	to investigate	this	bombing	in	your	state,	because	some	terrorists	decided	to	take out	a	federal	building.	Half	the	reason	DHS	is	so	screwed	up	is	we	had	to	cut their	training	budget.	So,	we’ve	got	a	bill	on	the	floor	that	will	cut	the	red	ink, it’s	in	danger	of	not	making	it	through	the	house,	and	you	are	the	biggest roadblock.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Oh,	crap! </i>	Clark	glanced	out	the	window,	tinted	blue	from	the	unusual	thickness of	the	bulletproof	glass.	Beyond,	the	sky	was	just	growing	pale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	want	me	to	drop	my	opposition	of	Mr.	Skaggs’s	bill.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Skaggs	and	the	President	nodded.	Price	gave	him	a	friendly	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	do	that,	Mr.	Clark,	and	I’ll	see	to	it	your	National	Guard	captain	doesn’t	go to	jail—or	to	the	electric	chair.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p234"></a>“Sir,	you	are	going	to	hold	that	woman	hostage	to	this	bill?	Is	that	what	this	is about?”	Clark’s	voice	held	enough	of	an	edge	that	the	Secret	Service	agent stepped	away	from	the	wall	and	caught	Clark’s	eye	in	a	silent,	menacing warning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	President	leaned	forward	in	his	chair,	a	frown	on	his	face.	“Mr.	Clark, politics	is	about	compromise.	You	ask	me	to	compromise	on	something	I	feel strongly	about.	I	ask	you	to	do	the	same.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark’s	felt	his	face	getting	hot.	“Mr.	President,	with	all	due	respect,	it	is	 <i class="calibre3">not</i>	the same.	You	are	holding	a	woman’s	life	hostage	to	your	political	goals.	It’s despicable!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Skaggs	sat	up	straight,	his	mouth	open.	No	one	talked	to	the	President	of	the United	States	that	way.	Clark	told	himself	to	calm	down	and	shut	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	you	who	are	despicable,”	the	President	said,	voice	laden	with	contempt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	expect	everyone	else	to	compromise,	but	you	won’t	do	it	yourself.	You hold	your	pride	and	your	career	above	everything.	That’s	what	this	is	about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’ll	lose	face	if	you	back	off	your	opposition	to	the	bill,	won’t	you?	You’ll lose	your	election,	too.	Is	that	what	this	is	about,	Mr.	Clark?	Is	this	some overblown	plan	for	you	to	win	reelection?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	closed	his	eyes	and	took	a	deep	breath.	This	had	to	stop.	The	discussion had	already	gone	far	enough—too	far.  <i class="calibre3">Too	far. </i>	His	fingernails	bit	into	the	palms of	his	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	I…	I	apologize.	Feelings	run	very	strong	on	this	issue.	I’ll	need	to	think about	it,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	President	leaned	forward	like	a	predator	sensing	weakness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Clark,	I	need	your	answer	now.	Debate	starts	on	the	bill	in	three	hours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	looked	at	the	floor.	Beautifully	polished	oak	planks,	laid	down	before	his great-grandfather	was	born.	If	he	abandoned	his	position	on	the	Fiscal Responsibility	bill	he’d	betray	his	constituents,	he’d	betray	everything	he’d	ever stood	for.	If	he	stuck	with	it,	Karen	Greenfield	might	go	to	the	electric	chair.  <i class="calibre3">God</i> <i class="calibre3">damn	it! </i>	He	was	going	to	lose	this	battle	whatever	he	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p235"></a>He	shook	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	I	can’t	abandon	my	principles.	Thank	you	for	reconsidering,	but	I	can’t	take you	up	on	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Skaggs	muttered	under	his	breath.	The	President	sat	back,	solemn,	betraying	a twitch	at	the	corners	of	his	mouth.	Son	of	a	bitch	was	enjoying	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Clark,	I	can’t	fault	you	for	sticking	by	your	guns—just	like	your	young National	Guard	captain.	We’ll	see	her	in	court.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	placed	his	napkin	on	the	table	and	stood.	There’s	wasn’t	much	left	to	say, and	he	couldn’t	take	another	minute	here	anyway.	Protocol	said	he	should	stay until	the	President	dismissed	him.	Damn	protocol. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	day,	Mr.	President.	Mr.	Skaggs—I’ll	see	you	in	the	House.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	and	walked	out,	the	watchful	eyes	of	the	Secret	Service	on	him	all	the way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	briefing	room	on	the	first	floor	of	Charleston’s	capitol	building	was	packed with	journalists.	This	had	all	the	elements	a	television	producer	would	kill	for: tragedy,	terrorism,	conflict.	The	room	was	awash	in	pale,	bright	light	from	the television	cameras,	giving	the	entire	place	an	unhealthy	pall.	It	was	hot	and damp	in	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	arrived	in	the	small	antechamber	next	to	the	briefing	room	several minutes	early.	A	few	minutes	later,	the	Governor	arrived,	with	Major	General Peak	in	tow,	as	well	as	two	other	men.	Governor	Slagter	introduced	them	as	the State	attorney	general	and	the	secretary	of	state.	They’d	arrived	together,	as	if the	four	of	them	had	just	come	from	breakfast	together.  <i class="calibre3">What	had	they	been</i> <i class="calibre3">discussing? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	dismissed	the	question	as	petty,	but	he	couldn’t	shake	the	feeling something	was	wrong.	General	Peak	he	had	known	for	many	years,	but	he	had no	reason	to	trust	the	others.	Late	the	previous	night,	Peak	had	called	him	and explained	the	promotion,	both	on	the	grounds	that	he	felt	Murphy	was	the	best available	candidate,	and	also	due	to	his	concern	that,	with	the	loss	of	his	job, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p236"></a>Murphy	might	leave	the	state	soon.	That	made	sense,	but	he	still	couldn’t	bring himself	to	trust	the	Governor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Introductions	over,	Governor	Slagter	preened	himself	in	the	small	mirror	near the	door.	“Let’s	get	this	show	on	the	road.	Colonel,	you	might	be	called	upon	to answer	questions	about	the	incident;	your	response	should	be	that	we’re investigating,	and	Captain	Greenfield	has	been	relieved	of	her	command.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	then.	Let’s	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter	walked	into	the	briefing	room,	followed	by	the	other	men.	Murphy	filed in	last.	He	rocked	on	the	balls	of	his	feet	and	wished	he	were	just	about anywhere	else;	he	still	didn’t	trust	the	press. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter	walked	to	the	podium	and	spoke	without	introduction.	“We’re	ready	to get	started.	I’ll	make	a	brief	statement,	followed	by	the	attorney	general.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lights	turned	up	brighter.	For	two	full	minutes	the	only	thing	Murphy	heard was	the	clicking	and	whirring	of	cameras;	flashes	illuminated	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yesterday,	in	the	space	of	fourteen	hours,	two	tragedies	struck	West	Virginia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First,	a	terrorist	bomb	struck	the	federal	building	and	killed	several	people.	At this	time	we	have	confirmed	nine	dead.	Search	and	rescue	efforts	are	continuing, and	we	are	cooperating	with	federal	authorities	in	this	investigation.	We	ask anyone	with	information	to	come	forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Several	hours	after	the	bombing,	an	incident	took	place	between	agents	of	the Department	of	Homeland	Security	and	the	West	Virginia	National	Guard.	This occurred	while	federal	agents	were	conducting	an	unconstitutional	search	and seizure	in	a	Charleston	neighborhood.	In	short,	the	DHS	agents	were	banging	in doors	and	rounding	up	the	residents,	arresting	them,	handcuffing	them	and leaving	them	to	sit	in	the	street	in	the	rain.	We	have	no	indication	that	any	of these	individuals	had	any	involvement	or	knowledge	of	the	car	bombing	earlier in	the	day.	The	only	reason	they	were	arrested	was	the	fact	they	were	male, Arab,	and	in	most	cases—not	all—between	the	ages	of	fourteen	and	forty.	At least	one	of	those	detained	was	a	twelve-year-old	boy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Folks,	this	is	the	United	States	of	America.	We	will	not	tolerate	activity	more</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p237"></a>suited	to	Stalinist	Russia.	As	you	will	shortly	see,	a	courageous	National	Guard captain,	Karen	Greenfield,	risked	her	life	to	intervene	in	this	unconstitutional activity.	The	DHS	agents	responded	with	deadly	force,	and	in	the	ensuing firefight	one	DHS	agent	and	one	National	Guardsman	were	killed.	Several	others were	wounded.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy’s	ears	perked	up.  <i class="calibre3">As	you	will	shortly	see? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	Mark	Brown,	the	attorney	general,	will	brief	you	on	several	items.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brown	stepped	forward	on	the	podium.	A	short,	balding	man	in	a	brown	suit,	he looked	confident,	almost	aggressive,	as	he	adjusted	the	microphone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	Governor.	Yesterday	our	state	police	polled	the	neighborhood	and discovered	DHS	personnel	confiscated	the	security	tapes	from	the	three	stores	in the	neighborhood	that	may	have	had	a	vantage	point	to	record	the	incident.	We are	working	on	obtaining	those	tapes,	and	we	are	considering	obstruction	of justice	charges	against	those	who	seized	this	evidence.	However,	a	concerned citizen	did	videotape	the	entire	incident,	from	beginning	to	end.	In	a	moment,	I will	play	that	tape,	and	copies	will	shortly	be	distributed	to	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	took	a	breath	as	the	reporters	started	buzzing.  <i class="calibre3">A	tape</i>.	That	was	a revelation,	and	was	guaranteed	to	change	the	dynamic	of	this	discussion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	consulted	with	the	secretary	of	state	and	the	governor,	and	we	made	two initial	conclusions.	“First,	as	to	the	federal	indictment	of	Captain	Karen Greenfield	on	capital	charges,	we	refuse	to	honor	the	extradition	request,	and explicitly	deny	the	right	of	federal	agents	to	arrest	her	or	take	her	out	of	the	state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Greenfield	operated	under	State	authority	at	the	time	of	the	alleged incident,	therefore	it	is	a	matter	for	which	the	State	of	West	Virginia	will	conduct the	investigation.	That	investigation	will	be	handled	by	the	State	Bureau	of Investigation	in	cooperation	with	the	National	Guard’s	Inspector	General’s office.	In	the	meantime,	Captain	Greenfield	has	been	suspended	from	her command	until	our	investigation	is	complete.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Second,	as	to	the	incident	in	which	federal	agents	violated	the	rights	of	West Virginia	citizens	by	rounding	them	up	like	cattle	and	tying	them	up	in	the	street: we	are	convening	a	grand	jury	to	investigate	the	issue.	Subpoenas	will	be	served to	the	individuals	involved,	as	well	as	the	Secretary	of	Homeland	Security	and the	United	States	Attorney	General.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p238"></a>The	reporters	looked	stunned.	None	of	them	expected	anything	like	this.	Neither had	Murphy.	Not	in	a	million	years	had	he	expected	this	in-your-face confrontation	with	the	federal	government.	Dale	Whitt	must	be	jumping	up	and down	in	his	seat	and	cheering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	we’ll	watch	the	video,	and	then	you	can	ask	questions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	attorney	general	waved	a	hand	to	signal	a	young	man	standing	in	the doorway,	who	rolled	in	a	cart	carrying	a	large	television.	They	quickly	had	the large	screen	adjusted,	and	the	aide	placed	a	disk	into	the	player. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	video	began	as	whoever	shot	it	rushed	to	a	window,	and	then	angled	down, apparently	from	a	fourth	or	fifth	floor	window.	Murphy	saw	the	DHS	staff	cars, and	a	dozen	men	walking	around,	carrying	assault	rifles.	In	teams,	they	walked house	to	house,	smashed	in	the	doors	and	marched	inside.	After	a	few	moments each	team	appeared	again,	dragging	men	and	boys,	who	were	deposited	in	the street.	Another	DHS	agent	stood	guard	over	the	prisoners.	At	one	point	one	of the	men	on	the	ground	twisted	his	head	around	and	his	mouth	moved,	and	the agent	shoved	him	over	with	his	boot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	video	quality	was	high,	but	sound	was	terrible,	just	the	sound	of	rain	and sirens	and	the	occasional	wail	and	scream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	the	camera	focused	in	on	a	Hummer,	and	two	soldiers	walking	toward	the DHS	staff	car	in	the	center	of	the	area.	Murphy	recognized	Karen	as	she approached	the	agents	and	began	talking	with	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	scene	unfolded,	it	became	clear	that	both	Karen	and	the	DHS	agents	were angry.	Other	soldiers	approached	from	the	sidelines,	as	did	DHS	agents.	Then the	man	Karen	argued	with—Agent	Hagarty,	Murphy	supposed—shoved	her	and shouted	something.	Men	on	both	sides	raised	their	rifles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	attorney	general	slowed	the	video.	“I’ll	slow	this	down,	so	we	can	watch	it frame	by	frame.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	happened	next	wasn’t	clear.	A	flash	of	light—maybe	lightning—just	as four	of	the	agents	ran	out	of	one	of	the	buildings,	weapons	at	the	ready.	After	the flash,	one	of	the	agents	fired.	Maybe	he	stumbled,	or	thought	the	flash	of lightning	was	a	gunshot.	In	any	event,	he	pulled	the	trigger	and	his	rifle	fired.	As the	video	advanced,	one	frame	at	a	time,	the	muzzle	flash	was	clear.	DHS	fired</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p239"></a>the	first	shot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Men	on	both	sides	returned	fire,	and	several	went	down,	including	Karen	and Manning.	She’d	broken	two	ribs,	he	knew,	when	the	bullet	slammed	into	her Kevlar	vest.	Even	with	the	lousy	sound	quality,	the	shots	were	clear,	as	were	her shouts	to	cease	fire.	One	of	the	agents	in	a	doorway	fired	another	shot	at	her, which	glanced	off	her	helmet	and	knocked	her	back	to	the	ground.  <i class="calibre3">Christ, </i>	she was	lucky	to	be	alive.	Then	the	firing	stopped	as	quickly	as	it	had	started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	immediately	shouted	orders.	Murphy	was	impressed	watching	the	scene. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	had	performed	better	than	he’d	realized,	immediately	reasserting	control over	the	situation,	and	directing	medical	care	for	the	wounded	on	both	sides.	The sad	part	was,	it	didn’t	matter	whether	or	not	she	was	cleared.	It	didn’t	matter whether	or	not	the	DHS	was	wrong.	She	would	forever	be	the	officer	who	had killed	a	federal	agent.	Her	military	career	was	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	governor	returned	to	the	podium	and	someone	raised	the	lights.	He	looked back	at	his	prepared	statement.	“Since	the	passage	of	the	1970	Drug	Control	Act, the	1972	Clean	Air	Act,	the	1996	AntiTerrorist	Act	and	the	2001	USA	Patriot Act,	we	have	seen	the	federal	government	take	greater	and	greater	authority from	traditionally	state	and	local	jurisdictions.	The	federal	government	has	for fifty	years	asserted	its	right	to	continually	expand	its	mandate,	to	override	local statutes,	to	practice	double	jeopardy	by	trying	in	the	federal	courts	people	who were	cleared	of	the	same	crime	by	state	courts.	In	the	last	two	years	alone,	the United	States	government	imprisoned	75	West	Virginia	citizens	for	actions	that are	not	criminal	under	West	Virginia	law.	Further,	in	the	last	two	years,	the United	States	government	shot	and	killed	17	West	Virginia	citizens	in	a	dozen incidents,	not	one	of	which	resulted	in	a	conviction.”	He	jabbed	his	index	finger at	the	cameras	as	he	spoke	the	last	few	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ladies	and	gentlemen,	after	review	of	the	constitutional	issues,	we	have concluded	the	federal	government	has	no	law	enforcement	authority	within	the state	of	West	Virginia	except	for	those	crimes	defined	in	the	Constitution	of	the United	States:	treason,	counterfeiting	and	piracy.	Since	we	have	no	oceans	here, it	would	seem	the	third	is	also	ruled	out.	In	any	event,	we	will	challenge	the	right of	the	federal	government	to	come	into	a	neighborhood	in	one	of	our	cities, gather	up	citizens	and	arrest	them	with	no	cause.	We	will	also	not	allow	the federal	government	to	conduct	a	politically	charged	trial	of	a	young	woman	who did	nothing	more	than	defend	her	neighbors	as	was	required	by	her	orders	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p240"></a>her	oath	of	service.	Questions?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	twenty	long	seconds	the	room	was	near	silent	as	the	journalists	absorbed	the full	weight	of	what	they’d	been	told.	Then	the	dam	burst,	and	questions	poured out	in	a	torrent.	Slagter	pointed	at	a	woman	at	the	front	of	the	crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Governor,	Dale	Whitt	has	announced	he	will	deliver	signatures	for	the independence	ballot	initiative	to	the	Capitol	today.	Does	this	statement	mean	you support	the	independence	measure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	governor	shook	his	head.	“Of	course	not.	I	am	a	loyal	citizen	of	the	United States	of	America.	I	do	believe	Whitt	has	a	core	of	truth:	the	federal	government has	gotten	out	of	control	in	the	last	fifty	years.	You	there,	in	the	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Governor,	how	will	you	prevent	the	DHS	from	arresting	Captain	Greenfield? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	you	use	force	to	keep	her	in	the	state?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain	Greenfield	will	remain	on	active	duty	and	under	state	authority	until this	issue	is	satisfactorily	resolved	on	all	sides.	You	saw	the	video.	It’s	clear	she intended	no	crime.	We	will	conduct	a	state	investigation—and,	if	necessary,	a state	prosecution—to	deal	with	her.	Next.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Governor	Slagter,	how	will	this	impact	your	chances	of	reelection?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	irrelevant.	Next.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Governor,	have	you	made	any	special	security	preparations	to	deal	with	Dale Whitt	when	he	arrives	with	the	petitions?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter	shook	his	head.	“Mr.	Whitt	is	a	private	citizen	exercising	his	democratic rights.	We	are	open	for	business,	and	will	welcome	him	and	anyone	else	with business	at	the	Capitol.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	is	there	a	concern	for	security?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter’s	frown	deepened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ma’am,	in	case	you	missed	it,	what	used	to	be	the	Byrd	Federal	Building	is lying	in	ruins	right	down	the	street.	Of	course	there	is	a	concern	for	security. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,	I	don’t	see	a	need	for	special	precautions	to	deal	with	a	private	citizen</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p241"></a>exercising	his	constitutional	rights.	Is	that	clear?	Next.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Governor,	most	of	America	is	in	a	rage	over	what	happened	here—both	the destruction	of	the	building,	as	well	as	the	shooting	of	federal	agents	while	they were	investigating	a	crime.	It’s	hard	to	imagine	you’ll	have	any	support	among your	fellow	governors,	or	from	President	Price.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter	frowned.	“Is	that	a	question	or	an	editorial?”	With	a	pause	for	effect,	he went	on,	“You’ve	asked	me	to	react	to	a	situation	that	doesn’t	exist.	The American	people	will	see	the	justice	of	the	situation,	especially	when	they	see that	tape.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Governor!	Are	there	any	leads	in	the	investigation	other	than	the	ones	the	DHS</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	FBI	produced	up	until	the	shooting	incident?	Haven’t	you	derailed	a terrorism	investigation	by	interfering?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	we	haven’t.	The	DHS	had	no	leads,	nothing	at	all	that	would	point	them	to the	Little	Cairo	neighborhood	except	for	the	fact	that	one	of	the	victims	of	this attack	was	an	Iraqi	American.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t	the	fact	he	is	Iraqi	enough	to	warrant	further	investigation?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly.	Do	you	think	we	should	also	round	up	all	the	Army	rangers	in	the region	and	arrest	them	as	well?	Or	all	the	college	students?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	reporter	shouted,	“Governor,	how	will	you	respond	if	the	FBI	or	DHS</p>
<p class="calibre1">uses	force	to	apprehend	Karen	Greenfield?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	met	General	Peak’s	eyes.	Peak	was	worried,	Murphy	thought.	Force, under	these	circumstances,	was	absolutely	the	last	thing	anyone	needed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	confident	Secretary	Stevenson	has	more	sense	then	that.	Any	use	of	federal agents	to	remove	someone	from	this	state	by	force	would	be	a	severe	escalation of	an	already	tense	situation.	What	we	need	right	now	are	cool	heads	and	calm counsel.	I	would	ask	the	President	to	recognize	that,	and	in	fact,	I	will	be	calling him	today	to	discuss	this	very	issue.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	reporter	raised	his	hand.	Murphy	recognized	this	one,	an	ABC	News reporter. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p242"></a>“Governor,	do	you	believe	you	have	popular	support	in	your	own	state	for	this action?	Considering	there	is	a	giant	burning	pile	of	rubble	right	here	in	the	city, it’s	unimaginable	that	people	would	support	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	see	about	that,”	Slagter	answered.	“I	am	confident	that	the	citizens	of West	Virginia	support	justice,	and	want	to	find	the	truth	of	what	happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jumping	to	conclusions	is	not	the	way	to	get	there.	I’m	more	than	a	little	bit annoyed.	You	are	the	second	reporter	in	here	who	has	determined	what	people’s reactions	will	be	without	asking	them.	Why	don’t	you	go	out	there	and	ask	our citizens	what	they	think,	instead	of	telling	them?	Last	question,	then	we’re done.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	we	have	unofficial	reports	from	the	DHS	they	have	arrested	another	suspect in	the	bombing,	someone	affiliated	with	Brian	Ibrahim.	Can	you	confirm	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	have	to	direct	that	question	to	the	Department	of	Homeland	Security.	I’m not	aware	of	any	arrests.	Thank	you,	ladies	and	gentlemen.	We’ll	continue	to conduct	regular	briefings	with	my	staff	as	the	investigation	continues.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	men	filed	out	of	the	room,	with	shouted	questions	raining	down	on	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	breathed	a	sign	of	relief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter	paused.	“All	of	you	to	come	with	me,	please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	followed	as	Slagter	quickly	made	his	way	to	the	elevator	and	they	rode upstairs	in	silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter	marched	into	a	large	office	on	the	top	floor,	his	back	straight,	tense, angry.	He	closed	the	door	behind	them.	His	voice	had	an	edge	to	it	when	he spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Colonel	Murphy,	I	want	you	to	keep	a	guard	on	that	Captain	of	yours	twenty-four	hours	a	day.	I	don’t	want	one	pretty	little	hair	of	hers	hurt.	If	you’ve	got	one guy	watching	her,	make	it	four.	Understand?	And	if	the	feds	come	for	her,	you do	two	things.	First,	you	call	me.	Then	you	do	whatever	it	takes	to	keep	their hands	of	her.	Don’t	let	them	get	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter	walked	to	the	window	and	stood,	looking	out	at	the	smoke	plume,	still</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p243"></a>rising	into	the	sky	twenty-four	hours	after	the	bombing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	one	more	thing,	Murphy.	Can	you	quietly	deploy	some	additional	men around	the	entrance	to	the	Capitol	and	all	the	approaches	to	it?	The	last	thing	we need	is	something	happening	when	that	lunatic	Whitt	shows	up.”	He	took	a	deep breath.	“<i class="calibre3">Goddamn	it! </i>”	he	said.	“Mark!	How	soon	can	you	have	that	Grand	Jury rolling?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	got	the	initial	work	in	place	sir,	but	jury	selection	will	take	some	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Make	it	fast.	I	want	the	Goddamn	Secretary	of	Homeland	Security	indicted,	and soon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter	turned	around,	his	face	still	flushed.	“All	right,	back	to	it.	Thanks	for sitting	through	that	damn	circus.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	filed	out	with	the	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	situation	was	out	of	control. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p244"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	Twenty-One</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">September	14</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	Murphy	sat	in	her	seat	and	looked	out	across	the	House,	half	full	now with	members	who	milled	around,	chatting	with	each	other.	She	had	a stomachache,	and	wished	she’d	stayed	back	in	the	office.	Not	today	of	all	days, with	the	vote	imminent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Speaker	pro	tempore	introduced	the	debate,	giving	thirty	minutes	to	each side,	with	an	interminable,	droning	discussion	of	the	rules.	After	what	seemed	an eternity,	he	said,	“The	chair	recognizes	the	gentleman	from	Mississippi.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	sat	beside	her	studying	his	notes,	no	sign	of	tension	on	his	face,	though today	might	be	the	most	important	of	his	career.  <i class="calibre3">Good</i>.	He	needed	to	stay focused	for	this.	She	heard	a	faint	tone,	and	looked	down	at	the	screen	of	her handheld.	A	message	from	the	office.	Did	Clark	want	to	talk	to	the	 <i class="calibre3">Washington</i> <i class="calibre3">Post</i>	after	the	vote	ended?	She	sent	a	response. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joseph	Maginnis	from	Mississippi	stood.	A	Democrat,	former	Air	Force	pilot and	NASA	astronaut,	he’d	been	injured	when	the	International	Space	Station was	punctured	by	a	tiny	asteroid.	He’d	patched	the	hole	and	saved	the	lives	of the	other	seven	crewmembers	from	five	different	countries,	making	himself	an international	celebrity.	Most	of	the	members	had	never	served	in	the	military, never	done	anything	more	dangerous	than	buy	a	drink	after	finishing	their	bar exams,	so	a	genuine	hero	was	hard	to	argue	with.	A	corpulent	man	with	pale blonde	hair,	he’d	once	been	the	picture	of	a	fighter	pilot,	but	since	retiring	he’d become	not	only	one	of	the	most	respected	members	of	the	House,	but	also	one of	the	largest.	Valerie	was	glad	he	was	on	their	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Chairman,	I	yield	myself	such	time	as	I	may	consume.	Today	is	going	to	be a	long	debate,	and	one	of	the	most	significant	ones	of	this	congress,	in	my estimation.	Few	bills	this	House	has	considered	have	had	such	a	wide-reaching effect	on	so	many	people,	and	we	must	remember	the	human	impact	as	we discuss	these	very	important	issues.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maginnis	went	on.	Valerie	looked	away	as	she	heard	another	tone	in	her	ear.	She looked	down	again.	David	had	sent	her	a	popup	message. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p245"></a>In	bold	red	letters	on	her	handheld,	the	question:	 <i class="calibre3">Are	you	ever	going	to	call	me</i> <i class="calibre3">back? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sighed,	looked	back	up	at	Maginnis	speaking	at	the	floor.	What	was	she going	to	do	about	David?	He	seemed	so	far	away	now;	it	was	easier	to	just	put	it off.	This	weekend.	She’d	call	him	then,	maybe	catch	the	shuttle	up	to	New	York. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	as	she	thought	it,	she	didn’t	really	believe	it.	She	closed	the	computer	with an	audible	snap	and	put	it	in	her	purse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maginnis	went	on,	arguments	she	knew	because	she’d	helped	write	many	of them	in	the	last	week.	It	was	hard	to	listen	to	him	go	on—even	when	the	issue was	critically	important,	sometimes	house	floor	debates	could	be	dull	as	dirt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Positions	were	already	staked	out,	and	nothing	they	said	would	persuade	anyone else.	The	speeches	weren’t	for	the	House,	they	were	for	the	TV	cameras,	and	the voters	who	would	see	their	representatives	debate	on	the	Hill.	In	the	end,	the vote	would	be	what	it	would	be,	regardless	of	all	the	talk	on	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	told	herself	not	to	be	so	cynical	and	pay	attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maginnis	was	wrapping	up,	and	Clark	would	be	next.	“Mr.	Chairman,	I	ask unanimous	consent	that	the	gentleman	from	West	Virginia	may	control	twelve minutes	of	the	time	allocated	to	me	and	that	he	may	yield	such	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Members	of	the	House	were	milling	about	the	room.	Less	than	two-thirds	of their	compliment	was	actually	here,	though	in	truth	that	was	unusually	high.	The biggest	charade	of	all	was	the	days	Congressmen	came	in	here	and	made speeches	to	an	empty	room,	all	the	while	their	images	were	beamed	back	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	have	this	many	people	in	here—easily	four	hundred—it	was	remarkable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Skaggs	sat	across	the	chamber	from	them,	and	nodded	at	Clark.	Cool	as	always, Clark	smiled	and	nodded	back.	After	what	had	happened	at	the	White	House	this morning,	she	was	amazed	he	was	able	to	maintain	his	composure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	stood	and	spoke.	“Mr.	Chairman,	I	rise	today	in	opposition	to	the	Skaggs Bill.	Now	is	the	time	for	us	to	do	what	is	right.	It	is	time	to	stop	taking	money from	poor	working	class	families	and	giving	it	to	the	wealthy	living	out	their retirements	in	the	Bahamas	and	Belize.	Here	we	are	in	the	worst	recession	since the	turn	of	the	century—two	million	jobs	lost	since	January	1st.	Let	me	repeat: two	million	jobs.	Mr.	Skaggs	correctly	believes	we	must	cut	expenses	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p246"></a>federal	government	level,	we	must	pay	down	our	debt,	we	must	even	consider balancing	the	budget	for	the	first	time	since	the	turn	of	the	century.	But	not	on the	backs	of	the	unemployed	working	class	people	who	lost	their	jobs	in	this recession.	Don’t	wipe	out	the	last	bit	of	social	safety	net	just	so	you	can	get reelected.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Skaggs	stood	up.	“Mr.	Chairman,	will	the	gentlemen	yield?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	replied,	“I	yield	to	the	gentleman	from	Kentucky.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Skaggs	spoke.	“Mr.	Chairman,	with	all	due	respect	to	the	gentleman	from	West Virginia,	he	couldn’t	be	more	wrong	about	this	bill.	This	bill	won’t	cut unemployment	benefits	for	the	men	and	women	who	have	worked	and	paid	for it.	It	cuts	the	benefits	for	the	people	who	refuse	to	work	for	a	living,	the	lifelong welfare	recipients,	and	the	people	who	suffer	from	nonexistent	legislated invisible	syndromes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Chairman,	reclaiming	my	time,”	Clark	interjected.	“Mr.	Skaggs	would	like to	portray	this	as	a	responsible	bill,	but	it	is	not.	I	have	many	men	and	women	in my	district	who	will	be	left	out	in	the	cold,	possibly	homeless,	as	a	result	of	this bill.	Working	men	and	women	who	have	fallen	on	hard	times.	Isn’t	it	interesting the	strongest	supporters	of	this	bill	are	in	the	states	with	large	populations	of wealthy	retirees?	This	is	all	about	getting	votes!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bob	Robinson	of	Florida	stood,	face	red,	and	called	out,	“Mr.	Chairman,	I	have	a Parliamentary	inquiry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“State	your	question.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	it	permissible	for	members	of	the	House	to	cast	aspersion	on	others’	motives in	this	debate?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	rolled	his	eyes	theatrically,	spread	his	arms	wide	and	shouted,	“Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chairman,	this	is	bizarre!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	chair	banged	his	gavel	and	shouted	back,	“This	House	is	out	of	order,	and	in particular	the	gentleman	from	West	Virginia	is	out	of	order.	We	will	refrain	from personal	attacks	and	emotional	diatribes	and	we	will	conduct	this	debate	in	a calm	fashion.	In	answer	to	the	gentleman	from	Florida’s	inquiry,	no,	it	is	not permissible.	Now,	we	will	return	to	the	gentleman	from	West	Virginia.	You	have</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p247"></a>seven	minutes,	sir,	and	I	ask	you	to	refrain	from	attacking	the	motives	of	your peers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	promise	to	be	more	sensitive,	Mr.	Chairman.	I	didn’t	realize	my	fellow representatives	had	so	much	to	be	sensitive	about.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Laughter	spread	across	the	floor	of	the	house,	and	Robinson	glared	at	Clark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	made	a	note	to	talk	to	Clark	about	that.	He	couldn’t	afford	to	make enemies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">It	didn’t	matter	to	Murphy	whether	the	tanks	were	under	his	command	or	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sight	of	a	main	battle	tank	at	an	intersection	in	an	American	city	made	his skin	crawl.	He	had	a	visceral	reaction	to	the	sight	all	too	common	in	other	cities in	his	lifetime:	Beijing,	Gaza,	Moscow,	Baghdad.	Not	in	America.	He	made	up his	mind	to	talk	to	General	Peak	about	removing	the	tanks	today.	They	sent	the wrong	message,	and	were	useless	in	an	urban	environment	besides. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	bottom	of	the	steps,	pairs	of	additional	soldiers	stood	guard.	More	stood in	the	shade	between	the	towering	columns	on	the	front	of	the	building.	Murphy didn’t	expect	any	problems,	but	if	they	came,	he	was	prepared	to	deal	with	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Wilkinson	of	Alpha	Company	commanded	the	security	detachment,	a mix	of	his	own	Alpha	and	Captain	Greenfield’s	Bravo	companies.	This	had visibly	disappointed	the	ambitious	Lieutenant	Antal,	acting	Commander	of	B</p>
<p class="calibre1">Company,	but	Antal	just	wasn’t	ready	for	this	mission.	He	was	a	good	staff officer,	but	needed	more	seasoning	before	he	commanded	this	type	of	sensitive detail.	And	he	couldn’t	very	well	put	Karen	in	charge	of	security	when	she	was the	object	of	most	of	the	security	detail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Murphy	watched	from	his	spot	about	a	hundred	feet	from	the	main	entrance to	the	State	Capitol,	Wilkinson	stood	at	the	foot	of	the	stairs	with	the	platoon leaders	and	platoon	sergeants	of	his	company,	the	wind	buffeting	them.	He	was	a good	officer,	and	would	give	them	appropriate	instructions.	Murphy	frowned.	As Brigade	Commander	now,	he	was	further	away	from	the	troops.	Even	standing here	was	not	a	good	idea.	He	had	given	his	instructions	to	the	Battalion’s	new commander,	Major	Elkins,	and	should	trust	his	subordinates	to	do	the	right	thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	walked	toward	the	front	entrance,	but	stopped	as	Dale	Whitt’s	red	pickup drove	past	one	of	the	tanks,	headed	toward	him,	easily	recognizable	with	its</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p248"></a>rusted	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	Murphy	would	stick	around	and	watch	after	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	pack	of	reporters	who	stood	near	the	entrance	realized	the	old	beat-up vehicle	belonged	to	their	quarry.	They	moved	down	the	stairs	almost	as	one	unit: half	a	dozen	cameramen,	plus	many	more	print	reporters	and	photographers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	probably	the	best-covered	petition	that	had	ever	made	its	way	to	the West	Virginia	Capitol,	but	then	again,	the	reporters	were	already	here	from	the press	conference,	so	it	was	convenient. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	cold	breeze	blew	by,	and	Murphy	wished	he	had	on	his	field	jacket.	The clouds	were	dark	grey—it	looked	like	the	rain	was	going	to	start	again	soon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	bottom	of	the	steps	to	the	Capitol,	Whitt	stepped	out	of	his	car	on	the driver’s	side.	Murphy	grimaced	when	he	saw	Joe	Blankenship	step	out	of	the passenger	side.	At	Saturn,	Mandy	Blankenship	had	been	a	reserved,	deeply religious	woman	who	leant	an	air	of	formality	to	their	usually	relaxed workplace.	God,	what	a	tragedy.	It	was	absolutely	absurd	to	think	the	Secretary of	Homeland	Security	dared	to	call	her	a	terrorist.	One	more	indication	they	had gone	around	the	bend	in	Washington. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	didn’t	look	any	better	than	he	had	last	time	Murphy	had	seen	him,	some months	before.	His	face	was	pale	and	drawn,	lips	tight	together,	dark	circles under	his	eyes.	His	dark	hair	was	greasy,	almost	black,	and	stood	up	straight	in the	wind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt,	on	the	other	hand,	looked	elated,	confident,	almost	bouncing	on	his	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	chatted	and	joked	with	the	reporters,	though	after	the	press	conference, Murphy	doubted	the	questions	were	friendly.	All	the	same,	they	treated	him	as	a man	to	be	respected—a	far	cry	from	the	Dale	Whitt	he	had	known	in	Highview, seen	as	a	local	eccentric	until	this	summer	had	changed	everyone’s	lives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whitt	said	something	and	the	reporters	stepped	aside.	He	and	Joe	Blankenship climbed	the	steps,	each	carrying	a	cardboard	box.	As	they	walked	up	the	steps, they	were	flanked	by	reporters	and	cameramen	shouting	questions.	Whitt continued	to	talk	to	the	reporters	as	Joe	Blankenship	walked	beside	him, frowning,	a	line	down	the	center	of	his	forehead.	A	few	paces	behind,	they	were flanked	by	two	soldiers	from	A	Company,	both	armed	with	M16	rifles. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p249"></a>As	they	neared	the	top	of	the	steps,	Whitt	saw	Murphy	in	the	shadows	and	called out,	“Colonel	Murphy,	hello!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blankenship	looked	up	and	saw	Murphy	as	well.	His	eyes	widened,	but	he	didn’t smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	raised	his	hand	to	wave	and	heard	the	thump	of	the	bullet	hitting	Dale Whitt	before	he	heard	the	crack	of	rifle	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	front	of	Whitt’s	face	exploded	and	blood	and	brains	splashed	across	the ground,	the	petitions	and	the	reporters.	A	second	shot	hit	him	in	the	back	and drove	his	body	to	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blankenship	spun	around,	dropping	his	box	to	the	ground,	and	shouted,	“<i class="calibre3">No! </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	of	the	reporters	scattered,	screaming.	One	of	them	ran	straight	into	Murphy and	knocked	both	of	them	down,	as	a	third	shot	blew	a	hole	through	the	center	of Jim	Blankenship’s	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get	off	me!”	Murphy	shouted,	struggling	to	his	feet.	He	could	hear	the	very distinctive	sound	of	turbine	engines	turning	over—both	tanks	were	firing	up their	engines.	Soldiers	ran	from	all	points	of	the	compass	and	surrounded Blankenship,	Whitt	and	the	remaining	reporters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	reached	for	his	phone	and	keyed	the	command	channel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cornstalk	Six,	Cornstalk	Six,	this	is—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stopped,	realizing	he	didn’t	have	a	new	call	sign.	“Elkins,	get	your	battalion deployed	ASAP.	We’ve	had	shots	fired	out	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elkins	voice	came	back	quickly,	“Already	got	reports,	sir,	I	will	keep	you informed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	now,	a	dozen	soldiers	lay	deployed,	prone	with	rifles	pointed	in	almost	every direction.	Three	more	soldiers	grabbed	Blankenship	and	the	boxes	and	pulled them	inside	the	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	looked	at	the	blood-soaked	mass	that	might	have	been	his	friend,	at	least for	a	short	while.  <i class="calibre3">Christ, </i>	what	was	going	to	happen	now? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p250"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	Twenty-Two</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">September	14</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Turville,	let	me	check	your	gear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	stood	uncomfortably	as	Meigs	checked	him	over.	“Gas	mask?	Got	your bandages?	Ammo?	Good,	good.	See,	you’re	not	such	a	screwup	after	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	looked	back	at	Meigs,	too	tired	to	respond.	They	stood	in	a	loose formation	outside	their	tent	near	the	ruins	of	the	federal	building.	A	light	drizzle came	down,	just	enough	to	soak	through	their	combat	gear	and	set	them shivering.	That’s	the	way	things	were	in	the	Army.	They	waited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	twenty	minutes,	a	seeming	eternity	in	this	drizzle,	Sergeant	O’Donnell	ran over,	followed	by	the	lieutenant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fall	in,”	she	ordered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right	men,”	said	Wingham.	After	five	months	with	the	unit,	his	manner	was much	more	confident	than	it	had	been	during	their	deployment	in	Arlington. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here’s	the	deal.	About	thirty	minutes	ago	someone	murdered	some	local activist	right	in	front	of	God	and	everyone,	while	the	National	Guard	stood around	and	watched.	We’re	going	to	assist	the	local	police	in	canvassing	the	area while	they	look	for	the	shooter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rules	of	engagement	are	simple:	you	don’t.	Unless	someone	takes	a	shot	at you,	you	do	not	respond.	You	will	not	lock	and	load	your	weapon.	Squad leaders,	I	will	hold	you	responsible	for	ensuring	this.	We	are	not	here	to	arrest anyone,	we	will	simply	escort	the	police	and	secure	intersections	as	they	perform the	search.	Questions?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	didn’t	make	any	sense	at	all.	Who	the	hell	calls	in	the	United	States	Army to	deal	with	a	local	murder?	Turville	swallowed,	and	then	spoke	tentatively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir?	Is	it	even	legal	for	us	to	be	doing	this?	I	thought	the	Army	couldn’t perform	law	enforcement	activities	or	something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p251"></a>Wingham	rolled	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,	Private	Turville,	I’m	not	a	lawyer,	I’m	an	infantryman.	These	are the	orders	Captain	Morris	gave	me,	this	is	what	I	will	do.	Got	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,	sorry	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Any	more	questions?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	one	had	any.	“Okay,	Sergeant	O’Donnell.	Get	them	loaded	up,	we’ll	be heading	over	shortly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Lieutenant	marched	away,	back	to	the	clump	of	officers	surrounding Captain	Morris.	O’Donnell	said,	“Everyone	on	the	truck.	Fall	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	platoon	broke	and	ran	for	the	back	of	the	two	and	a	half	ton	truck	that	sat idling	nearby.	As	they	boarded	the	truck,	a	couple	of	the	sergeants	laughed	at Turville. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	LT?	Is	it	legal	for	me	to	take	a	crap?”	Loud	guffaws	followed	the	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meigs	leaned	over,	his	face	close	to	Turville’s,	and	said,	“Hey,	asshole,	when	the LT	says	‘any	questions,’	you’re	not	supposed	to	have	any.	Got	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	leaned	back.	“Whatever,	Meigs.	I	just	didn’t	get	it,	is	all.	Why	is	the Army	on	this	mission?	Doesn’t	make	any	sense.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meigs	laughed.	“You	are	something	else,	Turdville.	Nothing	the	Army	does makes	any	sense.	When	are	you	going	to	figure	that	out?	You	just	do	what you’re	told	and	keep	your	nose	clean,	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	Corporal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	leaned	his	head	back	against	the	side	of	the	truck.	A	few	minutes	later the	truck	moved	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	wasn’t	the	only	one	asking	questions.	Already	at	their	destination,	ten blocks	from	the	State	Capitol,	Lieutenant	Colonel	David	Barksdale	had	grouped</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p252"></a>his	officers	and	three	Hummers	in	a	temporary	command	post.	His	company commanders	stood	in	a	loose	circle	around	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Each	company	will	secure	one	sector;	your	positions	are	marked	on	the	map here.	Vehicles	are	to	be	allowed	through	only	after	you	have	recorded	the identification	of	the	driver	and	the	license	plates	of	the	vehicle.	We	may	be	asked to	assist	the	local	police	with	sweeping	some	buildings.	Our	people	will	make	no arrests;	that’s	up	to	the	locals.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	officers	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris,	his	face	pale,	dark	rims	around	his	eyes,	spoke	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	I’m	a	little	concerned	about	this	mission.	This	place	is	already	nuts	over	use of	force	by	the	federal	government.	I	didn’t	think	it	was	legal	for	the	military	to participate	in	law	enforcement	activities.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barksdale	nodded.	“I	asked	the	same	questions,	Captain.	First,	on	the	local politics:	this	is	a	Black	neighborhood	we’re	operating	in.	Most	of	the	African Americans	in	West	Virginia	are	dead	opposed	to	this	stupid	secession	measure: imagine	West	Virginia	independent,	run	by	a	bunch	of	hillbillies.	These	folks will	be	happy	to	see	the	federal	government	around.	Second,	we	cleared	this through	the	Judge	Advocate	General	in	Washington.	As	long	as	we	don’t participate	in	any	arrests,	we	should	be	okay.	There	are	precedents.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	sir,”	Morris	said.	He	looked	relieved,	not	so	much	at	the	answer,	but that	Barksdale	didn’t	bite	his	head	off	for	asking	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barksdale	had	told	himself	to	let	up	on	Morris	for	a	while.	He	didn’t	want	his officers	too	afraid	to	make	decisions.	Morris	was	a	good	officer,	but	sometimes he	seemed	to	lack	confidence.	The	question	was	actually	a	good	start—it	showed he	was	thinking	ahead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Any	more	questions?”	Barksdale	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">None	of	the	officers	responded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	move	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	officers	turned	and	walked	back	to	their	companies,	leaving	Barksdale</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p253"></a>standing	with	his	battalion	operations	officer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gooding,	the	operations	officer,	said,	“You	know,	sir,	Morris	is	right.	The Posse	Commitatus	Act	clearly	forbids	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barksdale	nodded	and	sighed.	“Major,	this	is	a	stupid	mission	I	know,	but	the city	police	asked	for	assistance,	and	our	orders	came	straight	from	the	top. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Remember,	we’re	not	reporting	to	the	Army,	we’re	reporting	to	Homeland Security,	at	least	while	we’re	on	this	mission.	We’ll	do	the	best	we	can.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barksdale	didn’t	tell	them	what	he	really	thought.	No	one	cared	if	they	found anyone.	This	was	nothing	more	than	a	show	of	force.	Someone	wanted	to	remind the	West	Virginians	that	the	U.S.	Army	was	around,	in	advance	of	their	stupid referendum.	Idiots	back	in	Washington.	Idiots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Edmund	Wilson,	Speaker	pro	tempore,	spoke	again.	“The	third	reading	is	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	question	is	on	the	passage	of	the	bill.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	gripped	the	seat	of	the	chair	in	front	of	him,	then	glanced	over	at	Valerie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	for	the	first	time,	his	eyes	caught	the	curve	of	her	leg.	He	looked	away.	He’d managed	sixteen	years	in	Congress	without	succumbing	to	those	kinds	of temptations,	and	he	wasn’t	about	to	start	breaking	the	rules	now.	Besides,	Valerie would	just	tell	him	to	go	to	hell	if	he	made	that	kind	of	advance.	Al	Clark’s mother	hadn’t	raised	any	fools. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Distractions	over. </i>	He	looked	back	at	the	chairman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	clerk	counted	the	house	members,	and	then	said,	“The	ayes	appear	to	have it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Chairman,	I	request	a	recorded	vote,”	Clark	called	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wilson	nodded,	expecting	the	request.	“The	gentleman	from	West	Virginia wishes	a	recorded	vote.	We	will	vote	using	electronic	device.	Please	proceed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	indicated	his	vote,	and	then	sat	back	and	looked	at	his	watch.	“Any	more</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p254"></a>news?”	he	asked	Valerie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	anxious,	and	shook	her	head	in	small,	rapid	jerks.	“Nothing.	All	they have	is	the	approximate	part	of	town	they	think	the	shot	came	from.	The	police are	looking,	but…	I	don’t	know	how	they’ll	find	anyone.	Al,	apparently	the Army	is	helping	the	police	search	the	neighborhoods.	Can	they	do	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	frowned.	“That’s	the	last	thing	we	need	happening	right	now.	Folks	are	going to	go	nuts	seeing	Army	troops	in	the	city.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	sat	forward	and	looked	around.	Most	of	the	house	members	were	already here—they	would	know	the	results	of	the	vote	in	a	few	minutes.	He	checked	his watch	again.	Three	minutes	had	passed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	touched	his	wrist.	“Stop	fidgeting,	boss.	It’s	out	of	your	hands	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know,	I	know.”	He	reached	into	his	coat	pocket,	took	out	his	computer	and surfed	restlessly	to	the	Washington	Post,	CNN,	and	other	news	sites.	The exploding	violence	in	West	Virginia	had	all	but	pushed	the	vote	on	the	Skaggs bill	out	of	the	news.	What	in	God’s	name	was	going	on	there? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Al,”	Valerie	said,	squeezing	his	arm	a	little	too	hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	up.	The	count	stood	at	199	to	195,	with	only	three	minutes	left	for	the vote.	Still	thirty-six	votes	left	to	count.	The	numbers	crept	up	–	210	to	211. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	vote	for,	then	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	stared	at	the	count	as	it	ticked	upward.	Skaggs	only	needed	four	more votes	in	order	to	win. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	it	happened.	The	count	crept	up,	and	the	voting	stopped.	220	for,	214</p>
<p class="calibre1">against,	one	abstained.	The	bill	had	passed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	closed	his	eyes	and	leaned	his	head	in	his	hands.  <i class="calibre3">Christ</i>.	The	most important	vote	in	his	life—possibly	the	most	important	in	recent	history—and	he had	failed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	flinched	when	he	heard	the	shout. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p255"></a>“Get	down,	get	down!  <i class="calibre3">Gun! </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	slammed	himself	against	the	wall.	Across	the	narrow	street,	Leo	and Gomez,	the	other	members	of	the	fire	team,	crouched	behind	a	car.	In	the window	above	them,	Turville	saw	Halloween	decorations.  <i class="calibre3">What	the	hell	were</i> <i class="calibre3">they	doing? </i> The	four	of	them—one	of	the	fire	teams	in	third	squad—were	on	a small	side	street	packed	with	cars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	went	down	the	alley!”	Leo’s	shout	was	so	high	pitched	his	voice	almost cracked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Chill	out,	stay	cool	guys,”	Meigs	said.	He	keyed	his	radio	as	he	crouched against	a	car	just	in	front	of	Turville.	“White	Six,	White	Six,	this	is	White	Three Leader.	We	have	an	armed	individual,	heading	down	the	alley	next	to	our position,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lieutenant	Wingham	replied	immediately.	“White	Three,	this	is	White	Six.	You are	to	proceed	with	extreme	caution.	We	will	dispatch	local	police	to	your position	to	make	the	arrest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Leo,”	Meigs	whispered.	“I	want	you	to	lob	some	tear	gas	down	the	alley.	Go high	so	it	comes	down	on	the	other	side	of	the	dumpsters,	got	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	eighteen	year	old,	just	across	the	narrow	street,	nodded.	He	trembled	as	he loaded	a	grenade	into	the	fat	tube	of	the	launcher	slung	under	his	rifle.	All	four of	the	men	put	on	their	gas	masks,	and	then	Meigs	nodded	to	Leo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	heard	a	low	thud,	and	the	grenade	flew	into	the	alley.	His	heart	beat	so hard	he	could	feel	it	in	his	ears.	Why	did	they	gas	the	alley?	What	if	someone came	out	with	a	gun—came	out	shooting?	What	if	the	killer	was	in	there? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	slowly	pulled	back	the	charging	handle	on	his	rifle	and	chambered	a round.	The	sound	was	muffled	from	inside	his	gas	mask	and	hood,	and	his	vision was	constricted.	He	could	hear	himself	breathing	fast.	Better	this	than	the	damn tear	gas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	smoke	puffed	out	of	the	alley,	and	then	Turville	heard	a	loud	clang.	Holy shit,	what	was	that?	Another	bang,	then	someone	came	running	out	of	the	alley, straight	at	them.	Short	black	guy,	hard	to	see,	his	body	silhouetted	in	the billowing	smoke.	He	had	something	in	his	hand—a	pistol. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p256"></a>Leo	shouted,	voice	muffled	under	the	mask,	“He’s	got	a	gun!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	raised	his	rifle,	flipped	the	thumb	safety	forward,	and	aimed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Turville,  <i class="calibre3">no! </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	squeezed	the	trigger	and	the	rifle	jerked	back	against	his	shoulder.	The running	man	screamed	and	fell	to	the	ground,	then	slid	to	a	stop	ten	feet	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	other	three	soldiers	ran	to	him	and	stopped,	staring	down.	Turville	hung back,	afraid	to	look	for	a	moment.	Then	he	took	a	step	forward.	The	teargas	was already	dissipating,	and	he	pulled	his	mask	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	a	kid,	maybe	fourteen	years	old,	maybe	younger.	He	stared	up	at	the	four men	in	their	combat	gear	and	gas	masks,	eyes	wide.	He	opened	his	mouth	to speak,	and	a	line	of	bright	red	blood	ran	out	of	the	corner	of	his	mouth.	He	didn’t have	a	gun—he	had	a	video	camera	gripped	in	his	right	hand.	A	small	hole	had punctured	the	front	of	his	chest,	but	it	must	have	made	one	hell	of	an	exit	wound, because	blood	soaked	the	ground.	Meigs	leaned	over	the	boy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	shit,”	Turville	whispered.	He	could	still	smell	the	acrid	gunpowder	and teargas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meigs	turned	to	him	in	a	rage,	ripped	off	his	mask	and	threw	it	at	Turville.	The mask	bounced	against	his	chest,	but	Turville	hardly	noticed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You_	motherfucker!_	What	the_	hell	_were	you	thinking?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	stared	back	at	Meigs,	eyes	unfocused,	his	mouth	open.	The	corporal shoved	him	back	against	a	wall,	his	face	swollen	with	rage.	He	grabbed	the	rifle from	Turville	and	shouted,	“I	ought	to	shoot	you	with	this,	you	stupid	cracker!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	background,	a	thousand	miles	away,	Turville	heard	their	platoon	leader	on the	radio.	“White	Three,	White	Three,	we	heard	a	shot,	what’s	going	on,	over?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meigs	turned	his	back	to	Turville,	then	keyed	his	microphone.	“White	Six,	this	is White	Three	Leader.	We	have	a	civilian	casualty.	I	repeat:	we	have	a	civilian with	a	gunshot	wound.	We	need	a	medic	right	now,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roger,	civilian	with	a	gunshot	wound.	I’ll	be	there	ASAP.	I	need	a	full	report. </p>
<p class="calibre1">White	Six,	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p257"></a>_A	civilian.	I	shot	a	civilian._</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meigs	crouched	over	the	boy	and	broke	out	his	field	dressing,	and	then	looked back	up	at	Turville. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Turville,	you’re	going	to	fry	for	this.	I	told	you	not	to	lock	and	goddamn	load!	I checked	your	weapon!	Even	after	that	you	loaded	your	goddamn	rifle	and pointed	at	someone	and	fired?	What	the	 <i class="calibre3">fuck</i>	is	wrong	with	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	blood	covered	the	street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	shook	his	head	and	started	to	cry.	“Oh,	shit.	Oh,	shit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gomez,	his	squad	automatic	rifle	slung	over	his	shoulder,	looked	at	Turville	with contempt.	“Go	ahead	and	cry,	you	stupid	fuck.	You	killed	a	fucking	 <i class="calibre3">kid</i>,	Turville. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	you	screwed	us	all.  <i class="calibre3">Motherfucker. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	sank	down	to	the	ground	and	watched	as	Meigs	and	Leo	tried	to	save the	boy’s	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	too	late. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Morris	winced	at	the	sudden	pain	in	his	right	ear.	Lieutenant	Wingham’s	voice sounded	high	pitched,	almost	at	a	squeal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hold	on	a	second,	sir,”	Morris	said	to	Major	Simone	Gooding,	the	operations officer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	keyed	his	microphone.	“White	Six,	you	need	to	calm	down	and	give	me	your report	in	a	professional	manner,	over.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">Morris	looked	at	Major	Gooding,	held	his	breath,	and	then	keyed	the	radio	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“White	Six,	did	our	people	fire	on	this	individual?	Over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Major	Gooding’s	face	paled	at	Morris’s	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Affirmative,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Damn	it,	I’m	on	my	way.	What’s	your	position?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lieutenant	Wingham	gave	him	the	position,	and	Morris	replied,	“Black	Six	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Major,	we’ve	got	a	problem.	One	of	the	men	in	my	first	platoon	shot	a	civilian. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	don’t	know	the	circumstances	yet.	Can	you	get	an	ambulance	and	let	Colonel Barksdale	know?	I	need	to	get	to	my	company.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simone	frowned.	“Oh,	God,	that’s	just	what	we	need.	You	go	deal	with	it, Captain.	Get	the	situation	calmed	down.	I’ll	get	the	ambulance	on	the	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	spun	around	and	called	out,	“Watson,	let’s	go,	right	now.	We	need	to	get</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p259"></a>to	first	platoon’s	position	yesterday.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.”	Specialist	Watson,	Morris’s	driver	and	radio	operator,	had	the HUMMWV	rolling	as	soon	as	Morris	got	into	his	seat.	Two	minutes	later,	as they	raced	toward	the	position,	Morris	received	another	call	from	the	first platoon	leader,	Lieutenant	Wingham. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Black	Six,	this	is	White	Six.	Please	be	advised	we	have	civilians	at	our position.	The	situation	is	getting	ugly,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watson	turned	the	corner	and	drove	into	the	intersection	of	Eagan	and	North Rand.	A	crowd	had	gathered	thirty	feet	from	the	intersection,	on	a	narrow	side street.	Morris	could	see	half	of	first	platoon,	plus	four	civilian	men	and	one woman.	More	men	and	women	crowded	the	opening	to	the	alley,	staying	well back	from	the	soldiers.	As	Morris	jumped	out	of	his	vehicle,	sized	up	the situation	and	approached	quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	folks.	An	ambulance	is	on	the	way,	we	need	to	make	some	room.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	the	hell	are	you,	motherfucker?”	shouted	one	of	the	men.	His	face	was swollen,	angry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	Captain	Michael	Morris.	I’m	trying	to	get	an	ambulance	in	here	to	the victim.	Who	are	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	my	son,	you	son	of	a	bitch!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	sized	up	the	scene.	A	boy	who	couldn’t	have	been	older	than	fifteen	lay on	the	ground,	blood	spread	in	a	pool	all	around	his	body.	Bandages	were scattered	about,	some	of	them	tied	around	the	boy’s	midsection.	Some	of	the blood	was	dried,	crusted	on	the	bandages,	and	the	medics	had	stopped	working on	him.	Morris’	shoulders	slumped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	woman	was	crouched	over	the	boy,	wailing.	Her	clothes	were	soaked	in	blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	head	of	the	intersection,	nearly	a	dozen	people	watched	the	scene,	and more	looked	down	from	windows	above. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	turned	and	looked	the	man	in	the	eyes.	“Sir,	I	can’t	undo	what	happened, but	I’ll	make	damn	sure	the	person	responsible	is	arrested	immediately.	We’ll	do whatever	we	can,	I	promise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p260"></a>“You’ve	already	done	too	goddamned	much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	father	swung	and	punched	Morris	in	the	face.	His	vision	went	black,	and	he fell	backwards	to	the	ground,	stunned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soldiers	grabbed	the	father	and	restrained	him.	Lieutenant	Wingham	helped Morris	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three	soldiers	dragged	the	father	away	from	the	scene	as	he	shouted.	Morris	put a	hand	up	to	his	nose.	Blood	came	away	on	his	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	did	this,	Lieutenant?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	it	was	PFC	Turville	in	my	first	squad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	looked	around.	Turville	leaned	against	a	wall,	his	face	red	and	bloated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Turville,	get	your	ass	over	here,”	ordered	the	lieutenant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	looked	up;	saw	Morris,	and	his	eyes	widened.	He	jumped	to	his	feet	and ran	over,	then	stood	at	attention	and	saluted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	did	not	return	the	salute,	but	stared	at	Turville,	his	eyes	cold.	Turville held	the	salute.	Morris	did	not	return	it,	and	hated	himself	for	what	he	knew	he had	to	do.	Turville	was	just	a	kid,	and	had	screwed	up	badly.	Now	he’d	have	to pay	adult	consequences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Put	your	arm	down,	private.	As	of	now	you	are	a	prisoner	and	are	no	longer entitled	to	salute.	Do	you	understand	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville’s	face	worked	and	his	reply	was	a	whisper.	He	dropped	the	salute.	“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’s	your	team	and	squad	leader?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lieutenant	yelled,	“Sergeant	Roy,	Corporal	Meigs.	Get	over	here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both	men	ran	up	and	stood	in	front	of	the	CO,	then	saluted.	He	returned	their salutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Meigs,	Roy,	because	of	your	negligence	one	of	your	men	shot	and	killed	an</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p261"></a>unarmed	civilian.	Do	you	have	anything	to	say	for	yourselves?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sergeant	Roy	shifted	his	feet	and	frowned.	“Sir,	we	made	the	orders	clear,	and	I personally	checked	everyone’s	weapons	to	make	sure	no	one	was	locked	and loaded,	just	like	the	LT	said.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	frowned.	“Lieutenant	Wingham,	I	want	both	of	these	men	to	report	to	me once	we’re	done	with	this	operation.	In	the	meantime,	Corporal	Meigs,	I	want you	to	escort	PFC	Turville	to	battalion	headquarters.	Do	you	understand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meigs	nodded.	“Sir,	what	should	I	do	with	his	weapon?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Give	it	to	the	MPs,	and	make	sure	they	sign	for	it.	You’ve	had	it	in	your possession	since	the	incident?	Has	anyone	else	touched	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	me,	sir,	I	took	it	from	Turville	right	after	it	happened.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	job.	Get	going,	I	want	this—person—out	of	my	sight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meigs	grabbed	Turville	and	led	him	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	that’s	the	motherfucker	shot	my	son.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	turned	around	at	the	shout.	The	crowd	at	the	corner	had	grown	larger—</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	angrier.	Two	of	Morris’	soldiers	still	held	the	father	off	to	the	side	of	the alley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three	of	the	men	from	the	crowd—teenagers—approached	Meigs	and	Turville. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Meigs,	Turville,	get	back	here.	Belay	that	order.	We’ll	send	you	to	battalion shortly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	to	Wingham.	“We	need	to	get	control	of	this	situation	now.	Post	some men	to	block	anyone	coming	down	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You,”	he	shouted	to	the	three	approaching	teenagers.	“Stop	right	there!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	teenagers	looked	at	Morris	with	disdain,	then	at	the	body	of	the	boy, then	back	at	Morris. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p262"></a>“What	if	I	don’t?	This	is	America.	You	gonna	shoot	me,	too?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	in	fact	I	just	arrested	the	stupid	son	of	a	bitch	who	did	it.	You	want	to	get	in the	way	of	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bunch	of	white	folks	shooting	up	the	town,	from	what	I	can	see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	they	spoke,	Lieutenant	Wingham	and	Sergeant	O’Donnell	placed	men	at	each corner	of	the	side	street	as	security. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	called	from	the	intersection,	“Why	don’t	you	go	shoot	some	rich	white folks	instead!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	ignored	the	shouts	and	catcalls	and	called	Lieutenant	Colonel	Barksdale on	the	radio. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	Colonel	Barksdale.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	the	background	noise	it	sounded	like	he	was	in	a	vehicle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	this	is	Captain	Morris,	with	a	report.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Proceed,	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	I	am	at	the	position	of	my	first	platoon.	One	of	my	men,	PFC	Turville,	shot and	killed	a	civilian.	Turville	has	been	placed	under	arrest.	I’ve	got	men	securing the	perimeter	of	this	position,	and	a	growing,	very	angry	crowd.	A	civilian ambulance	has	been	called,	but	it’s	too	late	to	do	anything.	That’s	it,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	you	maintain	your	situation	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	glanced	at	the	crowd.	“I	think	so,	sir,	but	if	this	crowd	gets	more belligerent	I	may	have	to	disperse	them.	These	folks	are	very	angry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	got	you,	Captain.	Try	your	best	to	not	to	have	to	do	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	flinched	at	a	loud	crack.	A	small	rock	bounced	off	his	helmet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,	I	will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	marched	toward	the	edge	of	the	intersection,	which	four	of	his	men	were</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p263"></a>blocking.	Morris	guessed	there	were	now	about	twenty	men	there,	most	of	them teenagers,	really.	Morris	could	see	the	anger	in	their	eyes.	The	rest	of	the	crowd looked	to	be	just	gawkers,	onlookers,	but	not	people	he	needed	to	worry	about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen	to	me,”	he	shouted.	“I	understand	you	are	angry	about	what	happened here.	So	am	I.	I	have	placed	the	individual	who	did	this	under	arrest,	and	he	will be	tried	for	what	happened.	But	I	need	you	to	disperse	and	return	to	your	homes or	wherever	else,	now.	An	ambulance	is	on	the	way	to	pick	up	the	victim.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	young	man	of	maybe	sixteen	looked	at	Morris	with	contempt.	“This	is	my home,	and	that’s	my	cousin	you	shot.	I	need	 <i class="calibre3">you</i>	to	disperse,	motherfucker.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	heard	a	shout	behind	him.	“Sir,	we	got	dismounts	up	on	the	roof.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	stepped	back	and	looked	up.	The	apartment	building	next	to	the	alley stood	four	stories,	and	someone	stood	there,	silhouetted	against	the	sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	flew	off	the	roof. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	shit!”	shouted	one	of	the	soldiers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One’	soldier	had	to	jump	out	of	the	way	to	avoid	the	object,	which	shattered	onto the	pavement.	A	brick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lieutenant	Wingham,	get	some	tear	gas	on	top	of	that	building.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	back	to	the	crowd	and	called	out,	“Please	disperse	at	once.	We	will deploy	tear	gas	in	thirty	seconds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	heard	an	ambulance	approach	with	a	wail.	Another	brick	crashed	into	the ground	near	him.	Morris	put	on	his	gas	mask	as	the	men	did	the	same.	The	mask still	smelled	acrid	from	the	last	time	they’d	used	it	in	the	gas	chamber. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fire,”	Wingham	called.	Four	tear	gas	grenades	fired	in	an	arc:	two	of	them landed	on	the	rooftop,	the	other	two	fell	back	to	the	ground.	The	noxious	smoke drifted	toward	the	now	shouting	crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wingham	shouted	to	his	men	to	reorient	and	target	the	crowd.	The	four	men calmly	reloaded	their	grenade	launchers.	One	of	the	teenagers	pulled	out	a	gun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">No! </i>”	Morris	shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p264"></a>“Fire,”	Wingham	said	at	the	same	time,	and	the	four	grenadiers	launched	tear	gas grenades	at	the	crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	teenager	shot	a	soldier	in	the	face.	Morris	ran	forward	and	heard	a	rifle	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	kid	with	the	gun	fell	to	the	ground,	shot	in	the	gut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	screamed,	“<i class="calibre3">Cease	fire! </i>	 <i class="calibre3">Medic! </i>	We	need	a	medic	right	now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	people	in	the	crowd	screamed	and	scattered	at	the	sound	of	gunshots.	The kid	on	the	ground	raised	his	weapon	again	to	fire,	and	one	of	Morris’	men	kicked the	pistol	away	from	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	reached	the	man	who’d	been	hit—Specialist	Jack	Frazier.	“<i class="calibre3">Medic! </i>”	he shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	brick	crashed	down	and	hit	a	soldier,	who	screamed	and	fell	to	the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lieutenant	Wingham,”	Morris	called.	“Get	your	men	out	of	this	alley	and	into the	intersection.  <i class="calibre3">Now! </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wingham	and	Sergeant	O’Donnell	rushed	the	platoon	off	the	narrow	street	and into	the	intersection.	The	remainder	of	the	crowd	scattered	as	the	soldiers	ran	out of	the	alley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	medic,	a	female	PFC	named	Hall,	skidded	to	the	ground	next	to	Morris	and Specialist	Frazier. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Oh,	Christ, </i>	Morris	thought.	Hall	and	Frazier	had	dated	over	the	summer.  <i class="calibre3">Why</i> <i class="calibre3">the	hell	do	I	have	to	have	women	in	this	unit? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	at	the	body,	her	face	frozen.	Frazier	had	only	a	small	hole	in	his cheek	next	to	his	nose,	but	the	exit	wound	was	gruesome	and	terminal:	a	good chunk	of	the	back	of	his	head	was	scattered	across	the	pavement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	spoke	in	a	monotone.	“He’s	dead,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	what	you	can	to	help	the	kid	there	who	shot	him.	And	we’ve	got	another man	down	over	there;	he	was	hit	by	a	brick.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p265"></a>He	paused,	wondering	if	he	should	say	something	to	her…	No.	He	turned	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wingham,	deploy	your	men	to	secure	this	intersection,	and	clear	those	rooftops. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	don’t	want	any	more	goddamn	casualties!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	men	spread	out	into	the	intersection	to	comply	with	his	order,	Morris followed,	going	to	the	center	of	the	intersection.	One	of	his	platoons	had	split	up into	squads	to	occupy	the	nearby	rooftops.	He	cracked	open	his	gas	mask.	The air	was	mostly	clear	of	tear	gas	now.	He	pulled	off	his	mask	and	called Barksdale	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Barksdale.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Colonel,	this	is	Captain	Morris.	Our	situation	is	rapidly	deteriorating.	We	were assaulted	with	bricks	thrown	off	the	top	of	the	buildings	at	our	position,	and	then someone	in	the	crowd	shot	one	of	my	men.	I	have	one	killed-in-action,	sir,	and one	seriously	wounded.	He	was	hit	by	a	flying	brick,	plus	there’s	one	more civilian	down	with	a	gunshot	wound.	I’ve	got	men	securing	the	perimeter	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	spoke	an	ambulance	came	screaming	into	the	intersection.	Lieutenant Wingham	ran	to	meet	it	and	led	the	paramedics	to	the	wounded.	As	they	did	so, Morris	heard	another	shot	fired,	this	one	distant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barksdale	spoke.	“Between	the	DHS	and	your	man,	we’ve	stirred	up	a goddamned	hornets’	nest.	There’s	been	another	shooting	incident,	this	one	not involving	our	troops,	but	the	locals	are	pissed.	Just	hunker	down	and	keep	your position	secure.	I’m	working	on	getting	us	pulled	out	of	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roger,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	heard	the	thump	of	another	tear	gas	grenade,	this	one	to	the	south	of	the intersection.	Twenty	tense	minutes	had	passed	since	the	ambulance	left,	and	his company	had	now	linked	up	in	one	location.	Then	men	were	hunkered	down, hoping	to	avoid	any	more	trouble.	Periodically	one	of	the	grenadiers	fired	a	tear gas	grenade	to	prevent	the	crowd	from	reforming,	but	otherwise	it	had	been	quiet since	the	initial	disaster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris’s	nose	was	red	and	swollen.	He	tried	not	to	touch	it—felt	like	it	might	be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p266"></a>broken.	What	the	hell	had	Turville	been	thinking?	Now	two	people	were	dead, and	Turville	was	sure	to	face	a	general	court-martial	on	their	return	to	base. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	wasn’t	the	only	one	facing	a	court-martial.	Morris	knew	he	would	be held	responsible	for	what	happened.	He	was	in	charge;	he	was	the	officer	who had	allowed	one	of	his	men	to	blow	away	a	kid	on	an	American	street. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Goddammit. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Black	Six,	this	is	White	Six,”	he	heard	Lieutenant	Wingham	call	over	the	radio. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	have	a	TV	satellite	truck	approaching	the	position	at	this	time,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop	them,”	he	ordered.	“Don’t	let	them	in	the	position.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	stood	and	saw	the	van	approaching	from	the	south.	Two	of	his	men	stood out	in	the	intersection,	rifles	slung	over	their	shoulders,	waving	the	van	to	a	stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	van	pulled	around	them,	tires	squealing,	and	pulled	directly	into	the	middle of	the	intersection.	What	the	hell	was	wrong	with	that	driver,	he	could	have	run over	one	of	the	men!	Morris	marched	toward	the	van,	a	scowl	on	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	cameraman	was	already	out	of	the	van,	filming	in	a	circle,	capturing	the smoke	and	the	men	huddled	around	the	intersection,	staying	low	behind	cars.	A second	man	set	up	a	tripod	and	sound	equipment,	while	a	blonde	woman	stepped out	of	the	passenger	side	of	the	van.	She	wore	a	red	coat	and	a	gold	pendant	in the	shape	of	a	hawk.	Her	hair	was	platinum	blonde,	not	quite	shoulder	length, and	her	blue	eyes	flashed	at	Morris	as	he	approached.	She	reminded	him	of Alicia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	already	hated	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	the	hell	are	you	doing	driving	around	my	men	like	that?	Didn’t	you	see them	wave	at	you	to	stop?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	with	the	tripod	stopped	what	he	was	doing	and	approached	Morris	from the	side,	hovering	protectively	over	the	reporter.	The	cameraman,	meanwhile, turned	his	lens	to	Morris	and	the	blonde	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	filming	here,	and	I	didn’t	see	any	police,”	she	said.	“I’m	Sarah	Davis from	NBC	Channel	Four.	Who	are	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p267"></a>“Ms.	Davis,	this	area	has	been	secured	by	my	men,	who	you	almost	ran	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	going	to	have	to	ask	you	to	stop	your	filming	and	go	somewhere	else, immediately.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	could	sense	the	camera	closing	in	on	him,	and	he	felt	his	stomach	clench as	he	realized	the	situation	he’d	gotten	himself	into. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	have	any	authority	to	tell	me	to	go	anywhere,	soldier.	We’re	not	in some	Pentagon-controlled	foreign	war	where	you	can	order	the	press	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	is	America,	and	I	am	filming	right	here.”	As	she	spoke	the	last	sentence	she pointed	her	finger	straight	at	the	ground	for	emphasis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	turned	away	from	him	and	spoke	to	the	man	with	the	tripod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Set	up	the	camera	with	those	soldiers	as	a	backdrop.”	She	pointed	across	the intersection	to	indicate	the	direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	clenched	his	teeth	and	kept	his	arms	straight	at	his	side.	“You	may	not film	my	men,	do	you	understand	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	rolled	her	eyes	and	turned	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	turned,	walked	away	and	called	Barksdale	on	the	radio. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	this	is	Captain	Morris.	We	have	another	situation	developing.	A	news satellite	van	just	drove	into	my	position,	and	they	are	planning	on	filming	my men	and	this	position.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barksdale	cursed.	“Don’t	let	them	film	your	troops!	Understand	me,	Captain?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.	I’ll	probably	have	to	use	force	to	take	the	camera	from	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Understand,	but	this	is	a	U.S.	Army	operation	and	I	won’t	have	damn	reporters wandering	around	filming	the	troops.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	hung	up,	and	Morris	called	out.	“Lieutenant	Wingham!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Lieutenant	ran	over.	“Two	men.	I	want	that	camera	disconnected	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p268"></a>film	removed	and	destroyed,	right	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Davis	primped	herself	in	the	mirror	of	the	van	as	the	cameraman	filmed	the activity	of	the	men.	The	cameraman	started	to	back	away	as	two	of	the	soldiers approached,	rifles	slung	over	their	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	please	stay	right	where	you	are	and	turn	off	that	camera.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cameraman	looked	at	Morris,	then	the	approaching	men,	then	at	Sarah Davis.	He	shook	his	head	and	continued	to	film	the	approach	of	the	two	soldiers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	soldiers	spoke,	his	voice	firm.	“You	are	going	to	have	to	give	that	to us,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	soldiers	grabbed	the	cameraman	from	the	side	as	the	other	grabbed the	camera. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	giving	you	the	camera!	What	the	hell	is	this?”	The	cameraman struggled,	his	face	red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	other	man	came	at	a	run,	but	Morris	and	Lieutenant	Wingham	stepped	in	his path. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	do	it,”	said	Morris.	“Look,	my	men	were	called	in	to	help	the	situation, and	we	have	been	shot	at	and	attacked	and	I	won’t	have	their	faces	on	the evening	news,	do	you	understand	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cameraman	shouted	as	one	of	the	soldiers	got	the	camera	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	do	you	work	this	thing?”	the	soldier	said,	trying	to	figure	out	how	to remove	the	tape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	no	tape,”	the	cameraman	said.	“It’s	on	a	satellite	uplink.	Your	whole Gestapo	act	was	filmed	live,	asshole,”	the	cameraman	said.	“I	hope	you	enjoy watching	yourself	on	the	news.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	contempt	in	the	reporter’s	voice	turned	Morris’s	blood	to	ice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wingham.	Tell	your	men	to	mask.	I	want	four	tear	gas	grenades	under	this	truck in	thirty	seconds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p269"></a>“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	spoke	to	the	two	soldiers.	“Give	him	back	his	toy	and	get	your	masks on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gas!”	In	addition	to	shouting,	Wingham	made	the	hand	signal	for	the	troops	to mask. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	soldiers	put	on	gas	masks,	and	panic	appeared	on	Sarah	Davis’	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go,	go!”	she	shouted	and	ran	for	the	van.	The	film	crew	rushed	to	get	back	in the	van	as	four	tear	gas	grenades	flew	into	the	center	of	the	intersection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Smoke	billowed	up	from	underneath	the	van.	The	reporters	sped	off,	a	cloud	of smoke	trailing	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ten	minutes	later	Morris	got	the	call	from	Colonel	Barksdale	to	get	on	the	trucks and	pull	back	to	the	federal	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Only	a	few	blocks	away	from	the	developing	chaos,	Murphy	stood	with	Joe Blankenship	at	a	counter	in	the	Office	of	Elections	and	Licensing,	arguing	with the	police	and	the	clerk.	Their	voices	sounded	disjointed	to	Murphy	as	a	radio talk	show	played	in	the	background. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sorry,	sir,	but	those	boxes	are	evidence	in	a	murder	investigation.	You	have to	turn	them	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	appeared	the	clerk	agreed.	Both	boxes	were	spattered	with	blood,	especially the	one	Dale	Whitt	had	been	carrying	when	he	was	murdered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blankenship	shook	his	head	fervently.	“No	way.	Don’t	you	understand	what	this is?	This	is	the	petition	we’ve	been	running	all	over	the	state	for	the	last	two months	to	get	signatures	for.	Today	is	the	deadline	to	turn	it	over	if	we	want	to get	in	on	the	ballot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	police	officer	put	his	hands	on	his	hips,	anger	on	his	face.	“Sir,	it	doesn’t matter	to	me	what	it	is.	I’m	working	on	a	murder	investigation,	and	those	boxes are	part	of	the	evidence.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p270"></a>Murphy	spoke.	“Officer,	I’d	like	to	talk	to	your	precinct	captain.	A	man	died	to deliver	these	petitions,	but	he	got	them	here.	For	you	to	take	them—even	for	one day—would	be	a	tremendous	miscarriage	of	justice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	officer	sneered	at	Murphy.	“I	know	what	this	is.	It’s	seditious	crap.	You can’t	tell	me	you	believe	what	they’re	doing	is	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	replied,	“It	doesn’t	matter	what	I	believe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	all	looked	up	when	they	heard	the	radio	host	talking	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	yet	another	bizarre	incident	of	violence	in	Charleston,	the	scene	of	several major	incidents	in	the	last	three	days,	troops	in	the	U.S.	Army	have	engaged	in	a shooting	incident	with	civilians	in	the	city	streets.	At	this	time	we	understand there	are	three	dead,	including	a	teenager	who	was	shot	while	videotaping	the Army.	According	to	sources	on	the	scene,	the	troops	were	assisting	local	police in	identifying	the	assassin	who	gunned	down	anti-government	activist	Dale Whitt	on	the	capitol	steps	just	this	morning.	All	I	can	say	is,	what	is	going	on there,	folks?	West	Virginia	is	starting	to	look	more	dangerous	than	the	Middle East.	That	will	be	our	topic	for	the	hour,	and	we’re	ready	to	take	your	calls.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	radio	host	moved	on	to	a	caller.	Murphy,	Blankenship,	and	the	police	officer looked	at	each	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blankenship’s	face	twisted	and	he	spoke,	his	voice	on	the	verge	of	breaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Those	people	murdered	my	wife.	You’ll	have	to	kill	me	to	keep	me	from delivering	these	petitions.	If	you’re	going	to	do	that,	go	right	ahead.	Otherwise, they’re	getting	turned	in.	Understand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	police	officer	looked	at	him	and	sighed.	“All	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	to	the	clerk.	“Hey,	you	got	any	paper	boxes	back	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	clerk	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bring	me	one	of	them.	You	can	put	your	petitions	into	the	new	box—I’ll videotape	you	doing	that—and	I’ll	take	the	old	boxes.	Deal?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blankenship	nodded.	“Thank	you,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p271"></a>“I’ve	got	to	get	going,	Joe,”	Murphy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	hurried	back	to	his	headquarters. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p272"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	Twenty-Four</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">September	15</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	morning	dawned	cold	and	wet.	Swollen	creeks	and	rivers	across	West Virginia	had	overflowed	their	banks,	challenging	the	capacity	of	the	state’s already	strained	emergency	services	far	past	the	breaking	point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	Charleston,	Morris	had	spent	a	sleepless	night	writing	a	report	on	the previous	day’s	incident.	.	On	his	arrival	at	the	temporary	headquarters,	the	first thing	he	saw	on	the	flatscreen	television,	always	tuned	to	Fox	News,	was	his own	face	as	he	ordered	the	reporters	hit	with	tear	gas.	The	media	was	having	a field	day	already,	and	had	moved	quickly	to	condemn	what	the	reporter	had called	his	“Gestapo”	act. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now,	as	he	went	through	his	verbal	report,	he	could	feel	Barksdale’s	cold	eyes on	him,	and	he	knew	there	was	no	recovering	from	this	They	stood	near	the	map table	in	a	cold,	damp	tent.	The	battalion	staff	officers	gathered	around	the opposite	side	of	the	tent,	studiously	turned	away	and	surely	listening	to	every word.	The	tent	stank	of	mildew	after	days	standing	in	the	rain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	was	it,	sir.	After	the	reporters	left	it	stayed	quiet	until	we	received	the order	from	you	to	pull	out.	Once	we	arrived	back	at	the	base	camp	I	had	PFC</p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	confined	to	his	tent	until	the	MPs	took	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barksdale	frowned.	“What’s	your	recommendation	for	dealing	with	PFC</p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	like	to	handle	it	in-house,	sir,	with	an	Article	15.	Turville	screwed	up,	badly, but	I	don’t	believe	it	was	deliberate	malice.	I	honestly	don’t	know	what	a	general court-martial	will	accomplish	other	than	ruining	a	young	man’s	life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barksdale	grunted.	“Well,	at	least	one	other	young	man	is	dead	because	of	your man’s	mistake.	I	understand	the	desire	to	use	non-judicial	punishment,	and frankly,	I	agree.	But	it	won’t	fly	in	this	case:	right	now	it’s	a	question	of	how serious	the	court-martial	will	be.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	see,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p273"></a>“Instruct	your	men	who	were	witnesses	that	they	are	not	to	discuss	the	incident with	anyone—not	even	each	other.	I	don’t	want	to	contaminate	their	testimony before	the	trial.	And	let’s	make	sure	PFC	Turville	gets	good	representation	from the	Judge	Advocate	General’s	office—I	don’t	want	some	wet-behind-the-ears lieutenant,	I	want	someone	who	knows	what	he’s	doing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barksdale	sighed.	“For	what	it’s	worth,	Morris,	I	think	you	are	right—it	would be	stupid	to	send	Turville	to	prison.	But	the	political	dimension	of	this…</p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain,	you	have	no	idea.	This	is	very	likely	to	blow	up	in	the	Army’s	face.	So what	we	have	to	do	is	work	extra	hard	to	make	sure	Turville	gets	a	fair	trial,	and give	the	Army	a	fair	chance	to	convict	him.	If	he’s	cleared	by	a	court-martial,	the country	will	see	we	went	through	the	appropriate	steps	to	investigate	and	deal with	it.	Whereas,	if	we	do	an	Article	15,	they’ll	say	we	let	him	off,	the	Army doesn’t	care	he	killed	some	kid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	people	were	going	to	blame	the	Army	no	matter	what	they	did.	All	the same,	Morris	agreed.	“Yes,	sir,	I	do	understand.	I’ll	do	my	best	to	make	sure	I	do my	part	correctly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,	good.	Now,	I	want	to	talk	to	you	about	what	this	means	for	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	didn’t	trust	himself	to	speak.	For	the	last	twenty-four	hours,	he’d assumed	his	military	career	had	come	to	an	end.	All	he	needed	now	was confirmation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,	Captain,	I	won’t	sugarcoat	it.	General	Blake’s	going	to	order	an	Article 32	hearing	for	sure,	and	it	looks	to	me	like	you	will	be	the	individual	held responsible	for	what	happened.	It’s	likely	you’ll	be	forced	out	of	the	service,	if not	worse.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.	I’ve	suspected	as	much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	do	have	an	option,	Captain.	You	can	go	through	the	investigation	and	the public	humiliation	of	being	thrown	out.	There’s	at	least	a	remote	chance	you may	go	to	prison.	Or	you	could	consider	resigning	for	the	good	of	the	service.	I can	probably	convince	General	Blake	to	close	the	door	on	this	investigation	if you	resign	and	walk	away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p274"></a>Morris	looked	at	the	wall,	his	eyes	unfocused.	“Sir,	I’ve	never	wanted	to	be anything	other	than	a	soldier.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	understand,	Captain.	I	can’t	even	imagine	what	this	conversation	must	be	like for	you.	But	you’ve	been	in	the	Army	for	a	few	years—I	think	you	understand why	this	has	to	happen.	What	matters	is	what’s	good	for	the	service,	not	for	you and	I	as	individuals.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,	I	understand.	I’m	going	to	need	to	think	about	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	reasonable.	We’re	returning	to	base	in	the	next	day	or	two,	as	soon	as	we get	the	orders.	Why	don’t	you	come	see	me	when	we’ve	settled	and	we’ll	talk about	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	least	that	gave	him	a	day	or	two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,	I	will.	Thank	you,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	are	dismissed,	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	stood	and	walked	out.	As	he	stuck	his	arms	in	the	tent	flaps	to	spread them	apart,	the	other	officers	stepped	away	from	him,	as	if	he	were	contagious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’d	carefully	avoided	him	since	returning	from	the	mission. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside	the	tent	it	was	cold,	but	the	rain	had	stopped. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Resign	and	walk	away, </i>	he	thought.	He	didn’t	know	if	he	could	do	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had	the	incident	happened	in	an	overseas	deployment,	the	Army	would	likely shrug	it	off	as	a	mistake,	with	an	inquiry	and	disciplinary	action,	potentially severe.	But	this	was	different.	They	were	deployed	in	an	American	city;	the	kid Turville	had	killed	was	an	American	citizen.	Turville	would	be	lucky	to	escape prison,	and	Mike	knew	it	was	a	very	real	possibility	for	him	as	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	walked	away	from	the	headquarters	tent.	Turville,	in	one	stroke,	with	one instance	of	supremely	bad	judgment,	had	ruined	four	lives:	the	dead	kid’s, Frazier’s,	his	own,	and	Morris’s.	All	because	he’d	loaded	his	weapon	when	he’d been	ordered	not	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	walked	aimlessly,	and	found	himself	down	by	the	Kanahwa	River.	Funny. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p275"></a>He’d	been	here	for	several	days,	primarily	downtown,	and	in	the	historic	district, and	this	was	the	first	time	he’d	really	looked	at	the	place.	It	was	a	nice-looking town,	especially	near	the	river,	but	a	biting	wind	blew	in	from	its	direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">November	was	approaching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stared	out	at	the	water,	and	stuffed	his	hands	in	the	pockets	of	his	field	jacket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why	the	hell	was	Turville	such	a	screwup?	He’d	been	trouble	since	Morris’s	first day	commanding	the	company. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	a	conflicting	voice	asked,  <i class="calibre3">If	you	knew	that,	why	did	you	send	him	on	the</i> <i class="calibre3">mission? </i>	He	vividly	remembered	Colonel	Atkins,	his	military	science	instructor at	Bowling	Green,	saying	that	it	was	unethical	and	bad	leadership	to	give	an order	you	knew	couldn’t	be	complied	with. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Resign	and	walk	away. </i>	What	the	hell	would	he	do?	His	whole	life	was	built around	the	Army.	Hell,	he’d	have	to	go	back	to	school	just	to	become	qualified to	do	anything	else.	Maybe	he	could	do	what	Alicia	and	his	father-in-law	wanted all	along:	become	a	politician. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Not	likely. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Would	Alicia	even	be	there	when	he	returned?	He’d	called	half	a	dozen	times, but	hadn’t	been	able	to	reach	her.	Maybe	he	could	try	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	stood	and	kept	walking.	A	lone	phone	booth	stood	halfway	down	the block.	He	went	in	and	dialed	the	number,	then	keyed	in	his	calling	card. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	phone	rang,	and	rang	again,	and	then	the	machine	picked	up.	Morris slammed	the	phone	down	in	frustration.	He’d	already	left	three	messages.	And he	already	knew	why	she	didn’t	answer:	Alicia	had	taken	Savannah	and	they were	both	gone	back	home	to	Kentucky,	to	her	father.	She’d	made	it	clear	she’d leave	if	he	didn’t	resign. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ironic.	Now	he	was	going	to	have	to	resign	anyway,	he	didn’t	want	her	back.	Not a	chance	in	the	world.	Back	to	cold	and	bitterness?	Back	to	the	daily	biting commentary?	Screw	that.	In	their	seven	years	of	marriage,	he’d	never	once	been able	to	make	her	happy,	never	once	been	able	to	satisfy	her.	She	hated	him	for getting	her	pregnant,	and	that	was	the	end	of	it	for	their	relationship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	what	about	Savannah?	His	daughter	made	his	life	worth	living,	in	a	thousand</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p276"></a>different	ways.	How	could	he	ever	leave	her?	Was	there	any	chance	in	hell	he could	ever	get	custody	of	his	daughter? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Probably	not	as	long	as	he	was	in	the	military,	that	was	for	sure.	Certainly	not	if they	court-martialed	him.	Even	if	he	resigned,	he	was	marked	for	life.	What	kind of	job	would	he	be	able	to	get?	Sure,	he	could	picture	the	job	interview. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Experience	and	skills:	Rappelling	out	of	helicopters.	Assaulting	a	defended position.	Movement	to	contact.	Call	for	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Give	me	a	break. </i>	The	Army	sold	the	ability	to	carry	leadership	skills	into	the civilian	world,	but	middle	managers	all	across	the	country	had	been	wiped	out	in two	years	of	layoffs.	He’d	be	like	some	of	the	other	officers	he’d	seen,	selling insurance	off-post,	or	hawking	encyclopedias	to	people	who	couldn’t	afford them.	He’d	have	no	money,	no	life,	and	no	daughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	told	himself	to	shut	up.	No	point	in	going	around	in	circles	like	this.	He would	find	a	job,	then	sue	for	custody,	do	the	best	he	could.	He’d	be	damned	if that	woman	would	take	off	for	Kentucky	with	his	child	without	even	the courtesy	of	returning	a	phone	call. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Karen’s	desk	in	the	makeshift	battalion	headquarters	was	piled	high	with documents.

<p class="calibre1">Morris	entered	the	room.	His	brow	was	creased	with	tension,	and	there	were angry	red	rims	around	his	eyes	as	they	darted	around	the	room,	at	the	on-duty NCOs	and	officers	who	worked	in	the	command	post. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	smile.	“Why	don’t	we	go	talk	privately?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stood	and	walked	around	her	desk,	ignoring	the	eyes	she	knew	followed	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	followed	her	as	she	led	him	down	the	hall	to	a	vacant	office.	She switched	on	the	low	wattage	light	and	closed	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	leaned	against	the	desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	are	you	making	it?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	far,	so	good,”	she	answered.	“You’ve	looked	better.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	been	a	rough	couple	of	days.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Was	your	company	involved	in	the	shooting?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.	One	of	my	guys—a	PFC	Turville—had	his	weapon	loaded	when	it wasn’t	supposed	to	be,	and	he	panicked	when	he	saw	a	kid	running.	Everything just	went	to	hell	from	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	that	feeling.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	I	guess	so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	eyes	met.	Despite	years	of	anger,	she	still	caught	her	breath	looking	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	son	of	a	bitch.	For	a	moment	she	railed	at	herself	for	weakness.	She’d	been hopelessly	in	love	with	him	in	college,	but	that	was	a	long	time	ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p278"></a>“How	are	they	dealing	with	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Turville	will	be	court-martialed,	likely	sent	to	prison.	We’ll	probably	yank	a stripe	from	his	team	and	squad	leaders.	My	battalion	commander	tells	me	I	can probably	avoid	an	investigation	and	possible	court-martial	myself,	if	I	resign	for the	good	of	the	service.	We’re	being	pulled	out.	We	go	back	home	tomorrow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	going	to	resign?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	yet.	Would	 <i class="calibre3">you? </i>	I	mean—what	the	hell	else	am	I	going	to	do?	I’m an	infantry	officer.	What	the	hell	would	I	do	in	the	civilian	world?	I’ve	never given	it	a	moment’s	thought	before.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	at	the	floor	and	laughed.	His	mannerisms,	his	posture—they	hadn’t changed	in	all	these	years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	what’s	crazy?	For	five,	maybe	six	years,	Alicia’s	been	telling	herself it’s	my	career	she	hates,	and	I’ve	been	telling	myself	the	same.	I	don’t	think that’s	it	at	all.	Here	I	am,	I’m	finally	going	to	have	to	quit,	and	the	thought	of listening	to	her	say	she	was	right—it	makes	me	hate	her.	Oh,	God,	does	it	make me	hate	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	rolled	her	eyes.	“Join	the	club.	I’ve	always	hated	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	Karen,	I	love	my	daughter	so	much.	Savannah	is	everything	to	me.	You can’t	even	imagine—I’d	live	through	a	thousand	hells	to	be	with	her,	but	I	don’t think	I	can	go	back	to	that	woman.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	looked	away	from	him.	“You	know	what,	Mike?	I	may	not	be	the	best person	to	discuss	your	domestic	woes	with.	You	won’t	get	any	sympathy	from me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	caught	her	eyes.	“You	know	I	never	stopped	loving	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	felt	the	furrow	between	her	brows.	“Shut	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	mean	it.	I	go	to	bed	beside	her	and	wish	it	was	you.	I	wake	up	expecting	you and	it’s	like	a	kick	in	the	gut	every	morning.	I	wish…	I	wish	Savannah	was calling	 <i class="calibre3">you</i>	Mom,	not	her.	Don’t	you	get	it?	One	night,	it	was	the	worst	mistake of	my	life,	and	I’m	still	being	punished	for	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p279"></a>“You	should	be	punished	for	it,	you	son	of	a	bitch.	You	broke	my	heart.”	Her vision	blurred,	and	tears	rolled	down	her	face.	“How	can	you	show	back	up	in my	life	after	seven	years	without	a	word,	and	now	you	tell	me	this.	God	 <i class="calibre3">damn</i> you!”	She	jerked	her	arm	up	and	wiped	the	tears	off	her	face.	“You	know	what? </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	can’t	do	this.	I	can	already	see	it	happening—in	a	couple	days	you’ll	be	out of	here,	back	to	wherever	the	hell	it	is	you’re	stationed,	you’ll	be	back	with	 <i class="calibre3">her. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">And	you	want	to	come	here	and	screw	with	my	mind.	Well,	screw	you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	slowly	shook	his	head.	“No.	Whatever	else	happens,	I	won’t	go	back	to	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	not	coming	back	to	me	either.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	shoulders	slumped	and	he	bobbed	his	head.	“I	guess	I	deserve	that.”	Looking defeated,	he	sat	down	on	the	chair	next	to	the	desk	and	sighed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sat	in	the	chair	across	from	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mike,	listen	to	me.	I	don’t	think	you	quite	get	it	in	that	self-centered	little	head of	yours.	We	were	engaged,	Mike.	We’d	been	together	four	years.	I	bought	my dress.”	Tears	rolled	down	her	face	unchecked	as	she	spoke.	“Did	you	ever	even once	think	about	me?	We	had	the	chapel	reserved,	and	my	friends	had	their stupid	bridesmaid	dresses,	we	were	done.	Everything	ready	to	go—oh,	God,	I was	so	in	love	with	you.	Do	you	know	I	would	have	taken	you	back	in	a	second? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	would	have	let	it	go.	So	you	got	drunk	and	slept	with	someone.	Big	deal, people	make	mistakes!	But	it	wasn’t	one	night,	you	son	of	a	bitch.	You	came	to me	and	said	you	were	leaving	me,	that	you	were	going	to	marry	that	horrible bitch	so	she	could	have	her	baby!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	stared	at	her,	his	eyes	wide,	silent.	She	thought	he	looked	like	a	deer, staring	at	an	approaching	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	had	to	go	to	my	family	and	friends	and	tell	them	you	were	gone,”	she whispered.	“I	had	to	cancel	with	the	church,	and	fire	the	pianist,	and	give	back the	dress.	I	even	had	to	tell	 <i class="calibre3">your</i>	friends.	You	never	even	took	your	ring	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	were	so	self	centered	and	weak	you	couldn’t	even	face	me.	I	still	have	the ring.	And	now—you	selfish	son	of	a	bitch—now	 <i class="calibre3">you</i>	are	unhappy,	now	your marriage	sucks	and	you	come	crawling	back	to	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	fell	to	his	knees	and	put	his	clasped	hands	in	her	lap,	looked	up	at	her.	She shied	back	from	him.	Tears	rolled	down	his	face.	“I	was	too	ashamed,	Karen.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p280"></a>couldn’t	talk	to	you,	I	was	just	so	ashamed	of	myself.	Karen,	I—I	am	so	sorry for	hurting	you.	I	am	so	sorry.	I	loved	you	with	all	my	heart	and	I	just	didn’t know	what	to	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	leaned	forward	and	their	lips	brushed—just	barely.	She	held	that	position, felt	his	lips	against	hers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	I	was	going	to	die	when	you	left	me.”	Her	lips	still	touched	his	as	she spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	did	too,”	he	replied,	his	hands	rising	up	to	touch	the	sides	of	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	eyes	were	closed	as	she	kissed	him,	feeling	his	stubble	against	her	face.	She sobbed	as	she	realized	this	would	have	to	make	up	for	a	lifetime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	broke	away	and	pulled	him	to	his	feet,	then	looked	him	in	the	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	go.	Don’t	come	back.	I	don’t	ever	want	to	see	or	hear	from	you	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	flinched	and	closed	his	eyes.	“I…	I	understand.	I	love	you,	Karen Greenfield.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	I	love	you,	you	bastard.	Go	home	to	your	family.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	backed	away,	opened	the	door,	and	stepped	out.	He	took	a	deep	breath,	as	if he	were	about	to	say	something,	and	turned	back	toward	her.	She	met	his	eyes and	shivered.	Then	he	closed	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	took	a	deep	breath	and	stared	at	the	closed	door.	Then	she	sat	at	the	dust-covered	desk	and	put	her	head	in	her	hands. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">October	20</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris’s	key	stuck	in	the	lock	just	a	little,	and	his	hands	shook	from	cold	and exhaustion.	He’d	been	up	all	night,	as	the	company	unloaded	equipment	and turned	in	their	weapons	and	masks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	a	pretty	good	idea	of	what	he	would	find	inside	the	house.	He	exhaled	in a	cloud	of	white	mist	and	dropped	his	rucksack	to	the	ground,	then	tried	the	lock again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	time	it	opened	and	revealed	the	bare	hallway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh,	man,	she	didn’t	screw	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	picked	up	the	heavy	rucksack	and	slung	it	over	his	shoulder,	then	entered	the house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’d	taken	everything.	Most	of	the	furniture,	the	books.	With	a	grunt,	he noticed	she’d	left	behind	his	favorite	chair	in	the	living	room,	the	brown	leather two-seater	easy-chair.	He	used	to	ask	her	to	come	join	him	on	it,	but	after	a while,	he	guessed	he’d	stopped	asking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	left	a	note,	attached	to	the	refrigerator	door	by	a	magnet	she’d	thoughtfully left	behind.	His	eyes	scanned	it,	but	he	wasn’t	ready	to	read	it	just	yet.	His	breath still	gave	off	clouds,	and	he	realized	she’d	left	the	heat	off.	He	switched	it	on	as he	walked	toward	the	stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upstairs,	the	bed	he	had	shared	with	Alicia	was	still	there,	along	with	his clothes.	But	everything	from	Savannah’s	room	was	gone,	including	her	bed,	and its	bedstand	with	the	sun	and	stars	decorating	it	in	phosphorescent	paint. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	closed	his	eyes,	leaned	against	the	wall.  <i class="calibre3">Come	on,	you	knew	she	was</i> <i class="calibre3">gone.	You’ve	known	for	two	or	three	weeks. </i>	But	…	 <i class="calibre3">Oh,	man. </i>	In	Savannah’s closet,	the	low	rail	they’d	put	up	for	her	clothes	was	still	there,	along	with	half-a-dozen	miniature	coat	hangers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p282"></a>He	sat	down	to	the	floor.	His	eyes	darted	from	place	to	place	in	the	room,	seeing the	holes	where	tacks	had	been	inserted	in	the	wall.	Somehow	he’d	been	hoping against	hope…	Maybe	she’d	just	temporarily	left	town,	or	wasn’t	around	when he’d	called,	or	something,	anything	other	than	this	stark	empty	child’s	bedroom with	a	red	plastic	coat	hanger	lying	in	the	middle	of	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	felt	too	tired	to	stand	up.	He	sat	there,	slumped	over,	and	stared	at	the	dust left	behind	where	Savannah’s	bed	had	been. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Fool. </i>	For	years	he’d	pulled	away	from	Alicia,	always	chasing	another	woman	in his	mind,	a	woman	 <i class="calibre3">he’d</i>	walked	away	from.	He	shook	his	head.	In	all	these	years he’d	never	given	up	the	fantasy	of	life	with	Karen,	a	life	with	her	that	would somehow	be	different:	satisfying,	happy,	whatever.	What	if	Alicia	had	loved	him all	along?	Alicia	hadn’t	poisoned	their	marriage—_he_	had.	When	was	the	last time	he’d	touched	her?	When	was	the	last	time	he’d	looked	at	her	with	love	in his	eyes? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	shriek	of	the	telephone	startled	him.	Slowly,	he	got	to	his	feet	and	walked	to the	bedroom,	then	picked	up	the	phone	and	sat	on	the	unmade	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain	Morris	speaking,	sir.”	The	rule	in	the	Army	was	to	assume	that	your caller	was	higher	rank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Morris,	this	is	Major	Ben	Wharton,	with	the	Judge	Advocate	General’s	office.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">JAG? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	can	I	do	for	you,	Major?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	Captain,	I	think	the	question	should	be	‘what	can	I	do	for	you?’	I understand	there	may	be	an	investigation	of	the	incident	in	Charleston.	I’ve	been asked	to	serve	as	your	counsel,	unless	you	intend	to	hire	outside	counsel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	took	a	deep	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	who	asked	you	to	serve	as	my	counsel?	I	just	walked	in	my	front	door	ten minutes	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain,	word	came	down	from	the	Commanding	General’s	office	to	expect	an Article	32	hearing.	Understand,	at	this	point,	there	is	no	official	investigation.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p283"></a>will	come	soon	enough.	But	because	the	charges	could	potentially	be	serious,	my boss	thought	it	would	be	best	you	have	someone	experienced	on	your	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	shrugged.	“All	right,	Major,	you’re	hired.	Should	we	meet?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	don’t	I	come	over	there?	I	know	where	your	place	is,	I’ll	bring	some steaks.	Your	wife	like	steak?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	may	not	be	such	a	good	idea,	Major.	My	wife	seems	to	be	out,	and	I	don’t think	she’ll	be	back	in	time	for	dinner.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	line	was	silent.	Then	Wharton	spoke	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	that	case	I’ll	bring	a	six-pack.	See	you	shortly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lawyer	hung	up	before	Morris	could	tell	him	no.	He	stood	up	and	walked into	the	bathroom,	looked	critically	in	the	mirror.	He	was	filthy	and	needed	a shower. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Screw	it. </i>	He	walked	downstairs,	picked	up	a	discarded	newspaper,	and	placed	it in	the	door,	holding	it	open.	An	icy	draft	blew	through	the	crack.	Then	he	went back	upstairs,	collected	clean	clothes,	most	of	which	were	piled	in	a	mess	on	the floor	of	the	closet,	and	got	in	the	shower. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’d	been	in	the	field	for	two	weeks,	and	it	took	a	while	to	get	the	dirt	and soot	free.	One	of	the	things	Morris	hated,	though	he’d	gotten	used	to	it	over	the years,	was	the	inability	to	get	clean	while	deployed.	Didn’t	matter	that	it	had rained	most	of	the	time	they	were	in	West	Virginia—he	still	came	back	filthy,	his uniforms	stinking	of	mildew,	his	skin	tinged	slightly	green. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	took	his	shower	mechanically,	and	then	got	out,	not	feeling	any	better.	At least	he	didn’t	smell	any	more.	Then	he	cursed.	She’d	taken	all	the	towels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	grabbed	his	bathrobe	from	the	floor	of	the	closet	and	used	it	to	dry	himself off,	then	put	on	clean	clothes.	She’d	taken	the	clock	as	well.	He’d	need	to	stop by	the	Post	Exchange	and	pick	one	up	later	today.	If	he	had	any	money.	She might	well	have	cleaned	out	the	bank	accounts. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Enough. </i>	He	walked	downstairs	in	his	bare	feet.	Normally	he	would	never	show</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p284"></a>up	in	front	of	a	senior	officer	in	jeans	and	a	t-shirt	with	no	shoes,	but	for	God’s sake,	it	wasn’t	as	if	Morris	had	invited	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	his	foot	touched	the	worn	carpet	on	the	ground	floor	he	heard	a	knock	at	the partially	open	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello!”	called	a	voice	from	outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on	in,	sir.	I	was	just	cleaning	up.”	Morris	approached	the	door	and opened	it	all	the	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside	stood	a	very	tall,	barrel-chested	man	with	a	flannel	shirt	and	jeans.	He was	probably	ten	years	older	than	Morris,	somewhere	in	his	late	thirties.	A	little old	to	be	a	major.	In	his	left	hand	he	held	a	six-pack	of	Rolling	Rock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mike,	I’m	Ben	Wharton.	Since	I’m	your	lawyer,	I	want	you	to	forget	my	rank, just	call	me	Ben	unless	we’re	in	uniform	and	getting	ready	to	raise	our	right hands	or	something,	got	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,	come	on	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wharton	took	a	look	at	the	house,	bare	of	furniture	and	decoration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	like	my	ex-wife.	Packs	everything	but	the	kitchen	sink	when	she	goes	away for	the	weekend.	You	still	got	your	sink?	Good.	Where’s	the	bottle	opener?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	led	him	in	to	the	kitchen.	“I	don’t	know	if	I	own	a	bottle	opener.	Let’s see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	silverware	drawer	was	empty,	but	the	junk	drawer	underneath	held	a	few useless	implements.	But	there—at	the	back	of	the	drawer	was	an	old	rusted bottle	opener. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	took	it	out.	“Funny	she	takes	all	the	towels	and	furniture,	but	leaves	this behind.”	He	pulled	two	beers	off	the	six-pack	and	popped	the	tops	off,	then handed	one	to	the	lawyer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ben	replied,	deadpan.	“She	probably	figured	you’d	need	a	drink	when	you	got home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p285"></a>Morris	grinned.	“I’d	invite	you	to	sit,	sir—uh,	Ben—but	I	don’t	have	any furniture,	except	the	one	chair	in	the	other	room.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right	here	is	fine.”	Wharton	settled	down	on	the	floor	with	his	beer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	sat	across	from	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	we’ll	skip	the	bullshit.	The	reason	for	the	beer	is,	I’d	like	this	to	be	an informal	discussion.	Tomorrow	we’ll	meet	at	the	office	and	you’ll	call	me	sir	and I’ll	take	a	detailed,	recorded	statement.	Today	I	want	to	get	an	idea	of	what happened	out	there,	so	I	can	understand	why	the	Army	is	so	pissed	at	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	smiled	wryly.	“It’s	simple	enough,	sir.	We	were	sent	to	assist	on	a	law-enforcement	mission	in	an	area	already	inflamed	about	federal	involvement.	One thing	I	want	to	point	out:	I	explicitly	objected	to	the	mission	to	my	commanding officer,	Colonel	Barksdale.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	is	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I	wasn’t	sure	it	was	legal.	Posse	Commitatus.	The	Army’s	forbidden	from participating	in	law	enforcement	within	the	borders	of	the	United	States.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	familiar	with	the	statute.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	Colonel	Barksdale	said	any	arrests	would	be	made	by	local	personnel, and	these	were	our	orders.	So	we	moved	out.	I	gave	explicit	orders	to	my	folks not	to	lock	and	load	their	weapons.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will	your	lieutenants	and	sergeants	back	that	up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,	why	not?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	go	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	moved	out	into	a	dense	urban	area.	The	police	were	searching	house	to house,	though	for	what	reason	I	don’t	know—whoever	shot	that	guy	was	long gone	by	the	time	we	arrived,	I’m	sure	of	it.	But	the	locals	were	very	pissed	to	see the	Army	patrolling	their	streets.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	only	imagine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p286"></a>“So	one	of	my	squads	was	moving	down	an	alley	when	they	saw	someone running.	They	popped	teargas	grenades	and	waited,	then	saw	someone	running	at them	out	of	the	alley.	All	the	members	of	the	fire	team	say	the	same	thing:	they thought	he	had	a	gun.	One	of	my	men,	PFC	Turville,	fired	the	shot	that	killed this	kid.	Turned	out	the	kid	had	a	video	camera,	but	it	was	too	late,	he	was dead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	what	happened	next?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	we	converged	on	the	scene.	I	placed	PFC	Turville	under	arrest.	By	that time	the	parents	were	on	the	scene,	and	a	growing	crowd,	and	some	kid	shot	one of	my	guys,	and	the	situation	escalated.	We	deployed	tear	gas	to	clear	the	crowd and	got	the	hell	out	of	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	you	lost	a	man,	killed,	right.	Any	wounded?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One—had	a	brick	thrown	at	him,	he’s	still	in	the	hospital	with	a	fractured collarbone.	Another	civilian	was	shot,	too,	the	kid	who	shot	one	of	my	guys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	one’s	still	in	the	hospital.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jesus.”	Wharton	finished	off	his	beer.	He	stood	and	walked	to	the	counter, popped	the	top	off	another	bottle.	“Ugly	situation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	if	I	get	it	right,	you	are	going	to	be	the	fall	guy	if	this	independence referendum	passes	in	West	Virginia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shocked,	Morris	almost	shrieked	his	response.	“<i class="calibre3">What? </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wharton	looked	at	him	with	a	wry	expression.	“Didn’t	you	know	what	this	is about?	The	White	House	needs	somebody	to	blame.	The	DHS	has	been	pissing off	people	for	ten	years,	conducting	unconstitutional	searches	and	arrests, generally	making	nuisances	of	themselves.	There’s	been	half	a	dozen	highly publicized	incidents	in	West	Virginia	in	the	last	couple	years,	several	involving innocent	bystanders	getting	killed.	The	situation	there	is	a	powder	keg.	So	now you	come	along	with—in	their	eyes—a	trigger-happy	company	of	gun	toting infantry,	and	blow	the	situation	all	to	hell.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	crazy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p287"></a>Wharton	nodded,	his	eyes	wide,	his	gestures	exaggerated.	“It	may	be	crazy,	but	I guarantee	you	the	White	House	will	do	everything	it	can	to	divert	blame	from itself.	I	don’t	know	if	you’ve	been	paying	attention	to	the	news:	there’ve	been demonstrations	in	Charleston	of	a	hundred	thousand	people.	You	are	the	perfect fall	guy.	Mike,	don’t	let	me	give	you	any	illusions	here,	I’ve	been	in	the	office the	last	couple	days,	I’ve	heard	the	talk	in	the	halls.	They	are	out	to	crucify	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Don’t	get	me	wrong:	the	General	will	go	out	of	his	way	to	avoid	any	appearance of	undue	command	influence	on	the	investigation,	or	the	court-martial	if	it comes	to	that.	But	everybody	knows.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	sat	in	his	empty	kitchen,	staring	back	at	the	lawyer,	wondering	how	the hell	he’d	gotten	in	the	middle	of	this.	He	stood	and	opened	another	beer.	His hands	twitched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What…	What	the	hell	can	I	do	about	it?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wharton	nodded.	“Bear	in	mind,	my	advice	is	only	worth	roughly	what	you	are paying	for	it.	But	I	say	fight	it.	Don’t	resign.	Don’t	give	up	command	of	your company	unless	they	force	you	to.	Will	anyone	else	back	you	up	on	objecting	to the	mission?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure.	I	think	so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fight	it,	Mike.	If	you	don’t,	they’re	going	to	screw	you	anyway.	At	least	this way	you	get	to	take	some	of	them	with	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm.	How	much	am	I	paying	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing.	The	taxpayers	have	taken	care	of	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	shook	his	head.	“You	know,	you	really	inspire	confidence.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look	at	it	this	way:	at	least	you’ll	get	your	money’s	worth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Colonel	Murphy	studied	the	daily	reports	from	his	subordinate	units,	not	at	all happy.	He	put	the	paper	down	and	rubbed	his	eyes.	His	wireless	phone	rang.	He glanced	at	the	number.	It	was	his	mother,	calling	from	Cincinatti. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p288"></a>“Hey,	Mom,	how’s	it	going	up	there?	How’s	Kenny?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	spoke	too	quickly,	her	voice	high-pitched.	“Ken,	they	are	shutting	down	the program	up	here.	Kenny	is	here	at	the	hotel	with	me;	all	the	patients	have	been discharged.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Discharged?  <i class="calibre3">What	the	hell? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mom,	what’s	going	on?	They	can’t	just	discharge	him	with	no	warning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ken,	they	said	their	funding	had	been	cut	off.	They	had	to	let	everyone	go,	all the	doctors	and	nurses	were	fired,	the	entire	wing	was	shut	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	my	God.	But	Kenny	was	doing	so	much	better.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know,	I	know.	I	just	don’t	know	what	to	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	sat	for	a	moment,	staring	at	the	wall.	This	was	a	federally	funded program.	It	must	have	been	wiped	out	as	part	of	the	Fiscal	Responsibility	Act—</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	new	budget	had	gone	into	effect	this	week. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	listen,	Mom.	I’ll	call	you	back	shortly.	I’ll	make	arrangements	to	fly up	there	and	meet	the	two	of	you,	then	we’ll	all	go	back	home.	I	do	need	to	ask you	one	thing.	Can	you—can	Kenny	stay	with	you	guys	for	a	couple	of	weeks? </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	going	to	be	at	least	a	couple	more	weeks	before	I	can	get	away	from	this mess	for	any	length	of	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	that’s	fine.	We’ve	been	wanting	him	to	come	stay	with	us	for	a	long time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great,	great.	Listen,	I’ll	call	you	back	shortly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.	Ken,	I’m	really	worried—he’s	twelve	hours	overdue	for	the	shot,	and he’s	already	doing	worse.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	closed	his	eyes.	“All	right,	Mom.	Maybe	I	can	get	him	into	Emory	or something.	I’ll	call	you	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	clicked	the	disconnect	button.  <i class="calibre3">Oh,	Christ. </i>	Even	if	he	had	the	money	to	pay for	the	treatment,	no	one	else	was	doing	it—the	program	Kenny	was	in	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p289"></a>one-of-a	-kind	experiment,	and	it	had	been	entirely	federally	funded.  <i class="calibre3">Maybe	we</i> <i class="calibre3">can	get	him	into	Emory	Hospital	in	Atlanta</i>.	Given	the	positive	results	he’d experienced	in	Cincinnati,	maybe	they’d	take	on	the	project.	Okay,	okay,	there was	something	he	could	do.	He’d	need	to	track	down	the	doctors	in	Cincinnati, get	them	to	talk	to	the	new	ones	at	Emory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	meantime,	he	needed	to	get	a	few	days	out	of	here.	A	quick	phone	call	to General	Peak	accomplished	that.	Murphy’s	new	XO,	Lieutenant	Colonel	Jian Chang,	would	act	as	brigade	commander	in	his	absence.	He	known	Chang	five years:	an	ambitious	officer,	almost	universally	called	Jan	because	no	one	could pronounce	his	name	properly,	he’d	probably	expected	to	get	the	promotion himself.	To	be	fair,	if	the	governor	hadn’t	personally	intervened,	he	would	have. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chang	couldn’t	be	happy	about	Murphy’s	promotion,	but	he’d	done	nothing	to show	what	he	felt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Half	an	hour	later,	after	making	some	arrangements,	he	left	for	the	airport.	On the	way,	he	looked	out	at	Charleston,	the	city	he’d	never	loved	or	wanted	to spend	time	in.	Murphy	had	grown	up	in	Atlanta,	a	good	sized	city.	He	disliked the	crowds,	the	traffic,	and	the	pretentiousness.	Charleston	wasn’t	nearly	as	big, but	big	enough	to	make	him	want	to	be	almost	anywhere	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	anybody’s	guess	what	would	happen	in	the	next	few	days.	The	federal building	destroyed.	A	shootout	between	Bravo	Company	and	federal	law enforcement	officials.	Dale	murdered	as	he	walked	up	the	steps.	Then	that	poor boy	killed	by	the	Army. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	scary	part	was	that	at	this	point	it	looked	like	there	was	a	strong	chance the	referendum	would	pass.	What	the	hell	would	he	do?	He	was	a	brigade commander	in	the	National	Guard,	for	God’s	sake.	Would	the	governor	activate the	Guard	because	of	the	referendum?	Would	the	assembly	pass	it?	He	would never	have	imagined	this	could	come	as	far	as	it	had,	but	regardless	of	his	belief, the	moment	was	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	could	not	believe	even	as	he	sat	here,	that	he	was	seriously contemplating	treason.	Because	that,	of	course,	was	what	it	was.	If	he	were	to accept	a	position	in	the	Guard	reporting	to	a	governor	of	a	state	that	had	decided to	secede,	it	would	be	treason.	No	question.	But	would	it	be	wrong?	His	oath was	to	protect	the	Constitution	of	the	United	States.	Did	the	federal	government represent	that	constitution	any	more,	or	operate	within	its	bounds?	After	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p290"></a>lifetime	of	loyal	service	to	his	country,	the	question	was	chilling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	shook	off	the	thought.	He	had	a	little	more	time	to	worry	about	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Right	now	he	had	Kenny	to	take	care	of.	At	the	airport	he	raced	to	catch	his flight,	though	his	uniform	granted	him	quick	passage	through	the	security checkpoints	without	his	having	to	wait	in	line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon	after	the	plane	rose	in	the	air,	Murphy	started	making	calls	to	track	down Kenny’s	doctor.	Doctor	Li	was	the	leader	of	the	project	in	Cincinnati,	an unprepossessing	man	who	wouldn’t	be	noticed	in	a	crowd,	unless	that	crowd happened	to	be	made	up	of	pediatric	neurologists.	In	that	field	he’d	become	a giant,	with	several	years	of	groundbreaking	research.	Murphy	could	see	it	in	the reactions	of	the	staff:	they	sat	up	straighter	when	he	entered	the	room,	and	spoke of	him	in	hushed	tones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy’s	seatmates	seemed	unhappy	with	the	calls.	On	his	left,	a	sixty-or-so man	read	a	novel,	his	brow	furrowed,	large	rheumy	eyes	shifting	about.	In	the window	seat	sat	a	women,	forty-five	or	so,	in	a	brown	business	suit,	her computer	sitting	on	the	seat-back	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	an	argument	with	a	hospital	clerk,	a	nurse	took	pity	enough	to	give	him Doctor	Li’s	personal	number. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	line	picked	up	after	three	rings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello?”	A	woman’s	voice,	with	a	Chinese	accent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dr.	Li,	please?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hold	on,	please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	waited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	this	is	Dr.	Li.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Doctor,	this	is	Ken	Murphy.	I’m	Kenny’s	father.	I’m	on	a	plane	on	my	way there	now.	Can	you	tell	me	what	happened	up	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our	program	was	cut	off.	We	were	a	federally	funded	project,	and	our	funding was	cut	off	completely.	We’ve	had	to	discharge	all	the	patients	and	cancel	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p291"></a>study.	All	the	doctors	and	nurses	are	unemployed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	nodded.	“Doctor	Chang,	can	you	tell	me	if	there	is	anyone	else	doing this	treatment?	Anywhere?	My	son—he’s	been	doing	so	much	better	since	he went	on	the	treatment.	I’m	very	concerned	about	what	might	happen	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	sir.	I	don’t	believe	there	is	anyone	else	doing	a	similar	study.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	I	can	get	him	into	another	hospital—I	was	thinking	of	Emory,	or	Eggleston Children’s	hospital—would	you	provide	me	with	the	treatment	information,	and possibly	they	could	duplicate	your	work	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Li	hesitated.	“Sir,	I’ll	be	happy	to	provide	you	with	the	information.	You	have one	big	problem	though,	I	must	be	honest.	Most	insurances	do	not	cover experimental	treatments,	and	this	was	very	expensive.	We	didn’t	bill	you	of course,	because	it	was	a	federal	research	study.	But	it	was	very	expensive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	expensive,	Doctor?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	spent	about	twenty	thousand	dollars	per	month	on	the	drugs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	frowned.	“For	how	many	patients?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	each	patient.	Each	patient	was	twenty	thousand	per	month.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	my	God.	That’s	obscene.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I	know,	Mr.	Murphy.	But	drug	is	experimental	you	see,	protocol	is experimental.	All	of	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	closed	his	eyes	and	rested	his	head	in	his	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right.	I’d	like	to	get	the	information	from	you	anyway.	I	have	to	try.	He	was getting	so	bad	before	I	got	him	into	the	program	I	thought	he	was	going	to	die.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know,	Mr.	Murphy.	It	was	an	awful	tragedy	for	us	to	shut	down.	We	had fifteen	patients	in	the	program,	and	they	are	all	cut	off	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	are	they	doing	off	the	treatment?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Li	did	not	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p292"></a>“Doctor,	how	are	they	doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	heard…	almost	a	gasp.	“Mr.	Murphy,	one	of	the	children,	a	little	girl, died	last	night.	It	seems,	in	her	case,	the	treatment	alleviated	the	symptoms,	but may	have	advanced	the	illness.	We	just	don’t	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	closed	his	eyes.  <i class="calibre3">God,	no. </i>	No.	He	took	a	deep	breath.	“She	died?	How old?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Murphy,	I	think	it’s	not	such	a	good	idea	for	us	to	continue	the conversation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	raised	his	voice.	“<i class="calibre3">Tell	me. </i>	How	old	was	she?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Same	age	as	your	son—six.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	get	me	the	treatment	information.	I’ll	be	there	today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	will	do	so.	When	do	you	arrive?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	plane	gets	in	at	two	p.m.	I’ll	meet	you	at	the	hospital?	At	three?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Three	o’clock.	I	will	be	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	swallowed	and	his	voice	broke	when	he	spoke	again.	“Thank	you, Doctor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	disconnected	the	line	and	sat	back,	closing	his	eyes.	The	little	girl	died.  <i class="calibre3">Oh,</i> <i class="calibre3">God,	please	no. </i>	Emory.	He	needed	to	find	out	about	the	children’s	hospital	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	pulled	the	phone	off	the	hook,	swiped	his	credit	card	again,	then	dialed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse	me,”	the	woman	next	to	him	said.	“Could	you	maybe	talk	a	little quieter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	gave	her	an	angry	look	and	turned	away.	No	use	wasting	even	a	second on	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon	he	had	the	basic	information	he	needed.	Eggleston	Children’s	Hospital	was part	of	Emory	University;	it	was	a	renowned	children’s	hospital.	They	did	not have	a	program	for	children	with	ALD,	but	did	have	some	experience	dealing</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p293"></a>with	it.	Would	they	take	his	military	medical	care?	Yes,	though	it	did	not	pay	one hundred	percent	for	civilian	installations.	Thank	God	he’d	been	activated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	the	medical	insurance	he	might	not	have	been	able	to	get	Kenny	treated at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	airport,	he	caught	a	cab	to	the	medical	center. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	late	that	night	before	Murphy	had	finished	talking	to	the	doctor,	collected the	records,	and	packed	up	Kenny	and	his	grandmother,	but	they	made	the	last flight	out	of	Cincinatti. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	might	have	waited	until	the	next	morning	to	fly	to	Atlanta,	but	one look	at	Kenny	had	underlined	the	urgency	of	getting	him	back	into	a	hospital. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kenny	had	severely	deteriorated.	Dark	circles	under	his	eyes,	and	his	right	eye seemed	to	wander	aimlessly,	disconnected	from	the	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	Daddy,	can	I	get	a	glass	of	water?”	Kenny	looked	pale	as	he	spoke,	dark circles	framing	his	eyes.	He	almost	had	to	shout	to	be	heard	over	the	screaming engines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,	Kenny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	stepped	past	his	mother,	who	slept	in	the	aisle	seat,	and	walked	up	to	the galley	in	the	middle	of	the	plane. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Could	I	have	a	cup	of	water?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure.”	The	flight	attendant,	a	young	man	with	dark,	swept	back	hair,	handed him	a	cup. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,”	he	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because	of	the	last-minute	ticket	purchases,	they	were	seated	almost	in	the	very back	of	the	airplane,	between	the	twin	engines.	As	he	made	his	way	back	to	their seats,	he	saw	Kenny	stiffen	and	cry	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	ran	to	the	back,	the	water	splashing.	The	flight	attendant,	who	saw	what had	happened,	followed.	His	face	had	gone	white. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p294"></a>Murphy	brushed	in	front	of	his	mother	and	back	into	the	middle	seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Daddy,	it	hurts.	I	want	to	go	back	to	Ohio.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know,	son.	We’re	going	to	try	our	best	to	get	your	medicine	again,	okay?	But the	program	in	Ohio	is	gone,	they’ve	shut	it	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tears	ran	down	Kenny’s	face	as	he	looked	back	at	his	father.	“Okay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	got	your	water.”	The	boy’s	hands	trembled	as	he	reached	for	the	glass,	and	the water	spilled	in	his	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind	him,	he	heard	the	flight	attendant	speak.	“Sir,	is	there	anything	I	can	get you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	another	cup	of	water,	please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	minutes	later	the	flight	attendant	returned	with	another	cup,	putting	it	in Murphy’s	outstretched	hand.	Murphy	held	it	to	his	son’s	mouth,	and	Kenny gulped	it	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you.”	Kenny	voice	was	no	more	than	a	whisper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy’s	mother	had	shaken	herself	awake	by	then.	“He	was	doing	much	better, the	last	couple	of	weeks,	Ken.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	days	since	he’s	had	the	shots,	and	Kenny	was	almost	as	sick	as	he’d	ever been. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kenny	leaned	forward	and	vomited,	the	contents	of	his	stomach	splashing	all over	the	seat,	his	lap,	and	his	father’s	uniform.	The	acrid	smell	flooded	the compartment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	gasped,	then	vomited	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	heard	someone	two	rows	away	say,	“Oh,	for	God’s	sake,	can’t	you	take him	to	the	bathroom?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	fought	to	stay	calm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,	Kenny.”	He	unbuckled	the	seatbelt,	sticky	with	vomit,	and	froze. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p295"></a>The	vomit	was	stained	red	with	blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mom,	find	out	of	there’s	a	doctor	on	the	plane,	right	away!	I’m	going	to	take Kenny	back	to	the	bathroom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	lifted	the	boy	out	of	the	seat	and	the	stench	of	bile	and	acid	scorched	his throat.	As	he	lifted	him,	Kenny	stiffened	again,	almost	a	convulsion.	Murphy fought	to	hold	onto	him	and	started	to	loe	his	balance	as	his	prosthetic	slipped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’ll	be	all	right,	Kenny.	It’ll	be	all	right.”	Murphy	said	it	as	much	to	himself	as the	boy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kenny	stiffened	again	as	they	moved	up	the	aisle,	and	clawed	at	his	throat.	He let	out	a	scream	and	convulsed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	sank	to	his	knees	as	the	boy	convulsed	in	his	arms,	his	screams	caught between	the	engines.	The	altitude	of	the	plane	had	shifted,	and	he	heard	the	pilot speak	over	the	loudspeaker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	the	Captain	speaking.	Ladies	and	gentlemen,	we	have	a	medical emergency	on	board	and	will	be	making	an	immediate	landing	in	Chattanooga. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	are	already	cleared	for	landing	and	will	be	on	the	ground	in	ten	minutes.	We apologize	for	the	delay,	and	will	provide	assistance	in	finding	alternate connecting	flights	to	Atlanta.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Thank	God, </i>	Murphy	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kenny	screamed	again	and	convulsed.	This	time	he	cracked	his	head	against	the base	of	a	seat.	Murphy	winced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	I	help?”	someone	said	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	looked	up.	A	forty-year-old	man	stood	behind	him	in	a	loose	suit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	a	doctor?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I’m	a	federal	marshal.	But	I	have	had	some	first-aid	training.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Probably	not	much	you	can	do.	If	he	goes	into	convulsions	again,	maybe	you can	help	hold	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p296"></a>“Okay.”	The	marshal	stepped	around	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kenny	twisted	again,	and	whispered.	“Daddy,	am	I	going	to	die?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	son.	You’ll	be	fine.”	He	knew	he	was	lying,	and	he	could	see	from	Kenny’s expression	that	the	boy	knew	it,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kenny	looked	back	at	him	and	started	to	cry.	“I	miss	Mommy.	Will	I	see	her	in heaven?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tears	filled	Murphy’s	eyes,	and	he	sobbed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Boy,	you’ve	got	to	stop	talking	like	that.	You’re	going	to	be	just	fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	held	his	little	boy	to	him,	and	thought	about	the	other	girl	from	Cincinatti—</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	one	who	had	died. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	whispered.	“Little	guy,	your	Mommy	loves	you	and	she’ll	always	be	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Always.	So	will	I.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kenny	vomited	again,	this	time	more	blood	than	anything	else.	His	eyes	had sunk	into	dark	hollows,	and	Murphy	held	him	close.  <i class="calibre3">Please,	please, </i>	he	prayed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Please	save	him. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	flight	attendant	came	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	we’re	about	to	land,	I	need	to	ask	you	to	get	in	your	seat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	held	his	son	tight	against	his	chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	afraid	I	can’t	do	that.	I’ll	just	stay	right	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kenny	doubled	over	and	screamed	again,	and	more	blood	and	vomit	appeared, too	much,	way	too	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	marshal	looked	up	from	his	position	behind	Kenny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	land	the	goddamned	plane,	all	right.	We	need	to	get	this	boy	to	a	hospital right	now.	Go,	go!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	sat	there,	his	uniform	covered	in	blood	and	vomit,	his	son	tight	against</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p297"></a>his	chest,	and	he	whispered	the	Lord’s	Prayer.  <i class="calibre3">Our	father,	who	art	in	heaven. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Hallowed	be	thy	name. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Kenny	shook,	and	stopped	breathing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	God!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	engines	screamed	now	as	the	plane	came	in	for	a	landing.	Murphy	felt	a hard	bump	as	the	plane	hit	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Frantically,	he	checked	Kenny’s	pulse.	None. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	lay	the	boy	down	and	tilted	his	head	back,	then	breathed	twice	into	his mouth,	the	acrid	taste	of	vomit	flooding	into	his	own	mouth.	Chest compressions.	Breathe	twice.	Chest	compressions.	As	the	plane	rolled	to	a	stop, some	of	the	people	in	the	front	stood	and	began	taking	down	their	luggage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	marshal	snarled	at	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sit	down!	Stay	in	your	seats	and	let	the	emergency	folks	through.	What	the hell	is	wrong	with	you	people?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	businessman	in	the	first	class	section	continued	pulling	his	luggage	from	the rack,	and	the	marshal	shouted.	“You!	Get	back	in	your	seat	or	I	will	place	you under	arrest.	Right	now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	sat	down	and	glanced	back	anxiously	at	Murphy	and	his	son.  <i class="calibre3">He	thinks</i> <i class="calibre3">Kenny	might	be	contagious, </i>	Murphy	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Paramedics	shoved	their	way	down	the	aisle	to	Murphy.	“Sir,	can	you	step	back please?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	did.	“He’s	got	no	pulse,	no	breath.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	paramedics—both	men	who	couldn’t	be	any	older	than	twenty-five—looked at	the	pool	of	vomit	and	blood	with	dismay,	then	looked	at	each	other.	One shook	his	head	slightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	long	has	he	been	without	a	pulse?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p298"></a>“No	more	than	two	or	three	minutes.	It’s	not	too	late.	It’s	 <i class="calibre3">not</i>	too	late,	damn it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	we’re	going	to	get	him	out	right	now,	into	a	helicopter.	Leave everything	here,	every	second	counts.	Got	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	nodded	and	turned	to	his	mother.	“Mom,	get	the	bags	and	take	a	cab	to the	hospital	behind	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded,	her	face	twisted	in	grief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	paramedics	unfolded	a	stretcher	and	put	Kenny	on	it,	then	ran	for	the entrance	to	the	plane.	Murphy	followed	them	outside	and	down	the	stairs,	where a	helicopter	sat	a	hundred	yards	away.	The	medics	took	off	at	a	dead	run	for	the helicopter,	with	Murphy	running	after	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	climbed	aboard,	one	of	the	medics	yelled,	“Strap	yourself	in!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	did,	and	watched,	terrified,	as	they	tried	to	revive	his	son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	too	late. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kenny	had	gone	to	join	his	mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p299"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	Twenty-Six</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">October	31</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Mike	Morris	double-checked	his	uniform.	Everything	squared	away.	He	wore	his green	dress	uniform,	with	not	very	many	decorations—he	had	no	combat	service to	date.	He	did	wear	a	ranger	tab,	and	had	done	the	necessary	parachute	jumps, though	that	was	an	experience	he’d	just	as	soon	not	repeat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wharton	sat	on	the	bench	a	few	feet	away.	He	looked	over	at	Morris.	“Relax, Captain.	They	won’t	start	without	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	walked	away	from	the	mirror	and	sat	next	to	Wharton. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike	Morris,	Major	Wharton	had	clearly	been	around	the	block,	and	wore decorations	Mike	would	not	have	expected	to	find	on	an	attorney,	including	a Bronze	Star	with	a	V	device	for	valor,	as	well	as	a	purple	heart	and	a	Combat Infantryman’s	Badge.	He	wore	a	combat	patch	from	the	Tenth	Mountain Division,	which	had	seen	combat	in	a	dozen	countries	in	the	last	thirty	years.	His medals	included	at	least	two	campaign	ribbons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	did	you	get	the	Purple	Heart?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Egghhh.	It’s	nothing	special.	I	was	asleep	in	the	barracks—I	was	a	young	PFC, in	fact,	when	it	happened.	Some	kid	decided	he	didn’t	want	Americans	around anymore,	fired	an	RPG	into	our	barracks.	I	got	beat	up	by	some	shrapnel	is	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wharton	didn’t	explain	the	V	device,	but	Morris	didn’t	press	the	issue.	Wharton must	have	been	enlisted,	then	gone	to	law	school	and	come	back	into	the military	as	an	officer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,”	Wharton	said.	“Enough	screwing	around.	You	understand	what	this morning	is	all	about,	correct?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wharton	went	on	as	if	Morris	hadn’t	spoken.	“This	is	the	Article	32</p>
<p class="calibre1">investigation.	It’s	the	equivalent	of	a	civilian	grand	jury,	and	the	investigating</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p300"></a>officer	is	the	man	who	will	determine	your	fate,	understand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wharton	continued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	dealing	with	a	Colonel	Frank	Sheeman.	He’s	old-school,	very conservative,	can	be	a	real	son	of	a	bitch.	But	he’s	a	combat	veteran,	and	he understands	things	get	screwed	up.	He’s	been	there.	You’ve	got	that	on	your side.	In	any	event,	he’ll	take	all	the	evidence	about	what	happened	and	make	a recommendation	to	the	commanding	general.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whether	or	not	to	court-martial	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right.	It’s	actually	pretty	good.	If	this	were	a	grand	jury,	you’d	have	no	right	to see	the	prosecutor’s	evidence,	or	to	cross-examine	any	witnesses.	In	an	Article 32	hearing,	we	will	be	there	the	whole	time.	We’ll	know	what’s	being	said,	and by	whom.	We’ll	be	able	to	figure	out	who	the	bad	guys	are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	frowned.	“I	don’t	believe	in	bad	guys.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wharton	shook	his	head	and	grinned.	“The	bad	guys	are	the	ones	screwing	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	you	have	going	for	you:	he	won’t	recommend	a	court-martial	unless	he’s pretty	sure	they	can	convict.	He	won’t	waste	the	Army’s	time	on	a	fishing expedition.	But	there’s	a	lot	of	pressure	on	this.	Understand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	did.	He	understood	he	was	screwed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	they	ask	you	questions,	I	want	to	you	to	answer	them	fully	and	truthfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	don’t	volunteer	information.	No	tangents,	and	don’t	give	them	anything	to hang	you	with,	all	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	wasn’t	even	0730	and	Morris	already	had	a	splitting	headache.	He	wasn’t ready	for	this.	All	it	took	was	one	screwup.	Even	if	no	charges	were	brought,	his military	career	was	over.	Didn’t	matter	if	he’d	led	a	perfect	career	up	until	this point.	One	screwup—especially	one	of	this	magnitude—was	enough	to	end	it	for him.	He	stood	again,	looked	out	the	window.	It	could	be	worse.	He	hadn’t	died in	that	alley,	like	the	boy	had,	like	Jack	Frazier	had.	He	wasn’t	in	the	hospital with	a	broken	collarbone	or	a	bullet	hole	in	his	gut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside,	a	T-72	tank	sat	in	the	traffic	circle	in	front	of	division	headquarters, right	next	to	the	flagpole.	Probably	captured	in	Iraq,	the	things	littered	American</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p301"></a>bases,	souvenirs	of	a	series	of	wars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	breakfast	felt	heavy	in	his	stomach,	his	neck	muscles	tense.	Normally	not prone	to	anxiety,	he	didn’t	care	for	the	feeling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on	back	over,	Mike.	You’ve	got	to	calm	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	sat.	“Sorry.	I’m	not	used	to	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	not.	Last	thing	you	ever	expected	was	to	face	charges	in	this	kind	of investigation.	But	these	things	happen,	Mike.	Accidents	happen,	and	people	get killed,	and	the	Army	has	to	sort	it	out.	Look,	you	gave	the	proper	orders	at	the right	times.	You	set	up	accountability	with	your	NCOs	to	ensure	the	orders	were followed.	PFC	Turville	clearly	disobeyed	those	orders.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	shook	his	head.	“That	may	be	true,	Major,	but	I	was	in	command.	I	can’t avoid	responsibility.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,	Mike:	it’s	a	human	reaction	to	feel	guilt	about	what	happened.	But	you’re allowed	to	feel	guilty	after	the	investigation	is	over	and	you	are	cleared,	not	a day	before.	Got	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Colonel	Frank	Sheeman,	the	investigating	officer,	barely	spoke	a	word	through the	hearing,	preferring	instead	to	listen	carefully	to	the	witnesses,	occasionally asking	a	well	thought-out	question.	Like	the	others,	he	wore	his	dress	uniform, replete	with	decorations	from	more	than	one	combat	deployment.His	mustache had	grown	far	beyond	the	size	allowed	by	Army	regulations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	hearing	took	place	in	a	room	in	the	Division	Headquarters,	strangely decorated	with	children’s	drawings	of	winter:	giant,	asymmetrical	snowflakes and	snowmen	who	looked	to	Mike	like	something	you	would	see	in	a	bad	horror movie.	Very	suitable	for	a	trial	beginning	on	Halloween,	and	not	a	room	where he	would	expect	an	investigation	to	be	held. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p302"></a>Five	tables	were	arranged	in	the	room,	facing	each	other	in	a	U	shape.	Colonel Sheeman,	the	investigating	officer,	sat	by	himself	at	the	base	of	the	U	shape.	At the	table	to	his	right	sat	a	court	reporter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	Sheeman’s	left,	at	the	first	table,	sat	PFC	Turville	and	his	attorney.	At	the second	table,	to	Turville’s	left,	sat	Morris	and	his	attorney. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Directly	across	from	Morris	were	the	prosecutors.	One	was	a	Major	Collins, younger	than	Major	Wharton,	and	with	a	lot	less	fruit	salad	on	his	jacket.	His cheeks	were	bright	red,	eyes	bloodshot.	Morris	knew	this	wasn’t	the	young apple-cheeked	look.	Major	Collins	had	the	look	of	a	heavy	drinker.	He	was assisted	by	a	sexy	young	first	lieutenant	named	Ellis,	who	also	had	red	cheeks and	pretty	legs,	and	was	attractive	enough	to	distract	Morris	from	just	about anything	else	in	the	room.  <i class="calibre3">Probably	a	good	thing, </i>	he	thought.  <i class="calibre3">I’ve	been	too</i> <i class="calibre3">stressed	about	this	as	it	is. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">They	wore	their	green	Class	A	uniforms.	The	one	exception	to	the	uniform	was the	court	reporter,	a	PFC	who	wore	his	camouflage	uniform	and	ignored	all	of them,	even	as	he	carefully	took	notes	of	the	proceedings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Colonel	Sheeman	opened	the	hearing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	a	formal	investigation	into	certain	charges	against	Captain	Michael Allen	Morris	and	PFC	James	Turville	ordered	pursuant	to	Article	32,	Uniform Code	of	Military	Justice,	by	Major	General	Wilson	Blake.	On	October	twenty-fourth,	I	informed	you	of	your	right	to	be	represented	by	civilian	counsel	at	no expense	to	the	United	States,	military	counsel	of	your	own	selection	if reasonably	available,	or	military	counsel	detailed	by	the	trial	defense	service.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	went	on	in	a	similar	vein	for	some	time,	then	called	Morris	and	Turville	up together	to	sign	a	paper	acknowledging	their	presence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	me	remind	you	my	sole	function	as	the	Article	32	investigating	officer	in this	case	is	to	determine	thoroughly	and	impartially	all	of	the	relevant	facts	of the	case,	to	weigh	and	evaluate	those	facts	and	determine	the	truth	of	the	matters stated	in	the	charges.	I	shall	also	consider	the	form	of	the	charges	and	make	a recommendation	concerning	the	disposition	of	the	charges	that	have	been preferredagainst	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	signed	and	returned	to	his	chair.	The	verbiage	sounded	straight	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p303"></a>manual.	Sheeman	continued	reading. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	the	charges	involve	a	single	incident,	we	will	hold	one	Article	Thirty-two	investigation.	However,	multiple	charges	may	result,	and	I	will	make	a separate	recommendation	in	each	of	your	cases.	Should	any	trial	result,	those will	of	course	also	be	separate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	looked	down	at	the	charge	sheet	and	realized	his	teeth	were	grinding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Conduct	unbecoming	an	officer,	it	said.	Negligence	and	murder.	He	felt	himself begin	to	tremble	with	rage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wharton	put	his	hand	on	Morris’s	shoulder	and	leaned	close.	“Relax.	You’re turning	red.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	took	a	deep	breath,	got	himself	under	control. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally	the	hearing	got	underway,	and	Colonel	Sheeman	called	in	the	first witness,	Corporal	Meigs.	His	low-quarters	clicked	on	the	polished	floor	as	he entered	the	room	and	reported. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking	at	Meigs	drove	home	how	short	a	time	Morris	had	been	with	the	unit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	never	seen	Meigs	in	his	Class-A	uniform.	It	had	been	less	than	six	months since	he’d	taken	over	Bravo	Company,	and	in	that	time	they’d	been	on	two emergency	deployments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meigs	seemed	unusually	thin,	and	his	arms	and	legs	poked	out	of	the	uniform like	sticks.	He’d	shaved	his	head	down	to	the	scalp,	and	his	forehead	gleamed under	the	harsh	lights.	Morris	wondered	if	he	had	lost	weight;	the	uniform	did not	seem	to	fit	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Colonel	Sheeman	told	Meigs	to	raise	his	right	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	swear	the	evidence	you	shall	give	in	the	case	now	being	investigated shall	be	the	truth,	the	whole	truth,	and	nothing	but	the	truth,	so	help	you	God?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meigs	bobbed	his	head.	“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	have	a	seat,”	Sheeman	instructed.	Meigs	sat	in	the	witness	chair	at	the end	of	the	table,	facing	Sheeman.	“Major	Collins?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p304"></a>Major	Collins,	the	prosecutor,	spoke	from	his	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Corporal,	my	name	is	Major	Collins.	First,	I	want	to	let	you	know	you	can relax.	This	is	not	a	trial	here;	it	is	merely	a	hearing	to	find	out	as	much	as	we	can about	what	happened	on	October	19.	We’re	going	to	talk,	try	to	collect	evidence, okay.	I’ll	ask	you	some	questions,	then	these	other	attorneys	may	also	ask	you some	questions.	This	shouldn’t	take	too	long.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meigs	spoke,	his	voice	a	little	broken.	“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay	then,	Corporal.	Let	me	ask	you	a	couple	of	questions—just	for	the	record, understand.	Can	you	tell	us	your	full	name	and	rank,	and	the	unit	you	serve	in?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.	Corporal	Cantrell	Meigs.	I’m	a	fire	team	leader	in	First	Platoon,	Bravo Company,	First	of	the	Fifteenth	Infantry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	you	tell	me	your	relationship	with	both	Captain	Morris	and	PFC	Turville?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.	Captain	Morris	is	my	company	commander,	sir.	PFC	Turville	is	a rifleman	in	my	fire	team,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	how	long	have	you	known	both	of	them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Since…	I	guess	April	or	May,	sir.	They	both	started	around	the	same	time.	In fact,	I	think	it	was	the	same	as	the	bombing	in	Arlington,	sir.	Captain	Morris	had just	taken	command	of	the	unit	when	we	were	alerted.	PFC	Turville	was	outside the	distance	limits	and	came	in	late	for	the	alert.	Got	in	trouble.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville’s	attorney,	JAG	Captain	Harris,	leaned	forward.	“Colonel,	move	to strike	that	last.	It	is	irrelevant	and	could	be	prejudicial	to	my	client.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Major	Wharton	immediately	pounced.	“Sir,	with	all	due	respect	to	the	Captain,	I must	disagree	with	the	irrelevance.	If	PFC	Turville	has	a	history	of	disobeying orders,	it	could	be	central	to	my	client’s	case.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sheeman	looked	back	and	forth	between	them,	and	his	eyes	narrowed.	He twirled	the	corner	of	his	moustache	between	his	fingers,	his	eyebrows	squeezing together,	then	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gentleman,	this	is	not	a	trial	yet.	Let’s	save	our	courtroom	maneuverings	for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p305"></a>when	and	if	it	becomes	one.	The	statement	will	stand.	I’d	like	to	clarify	one thing,	though,	Corporal.	Were	you	in	PFC	Turville’s	chain	of	command	at	the time	he	reported	late?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.	Then	and	now.	He	came	in	about	two	or	three	hours	late	from	the	alert; it	caused	a	big	fuss,	sir.	My	recollection	is	he	wasn’t	really	punished	by	the	CO. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	let	Sergeant	O’Donnell	handle	it	informally.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you.	Continue,	Major.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Major	Collins	nodded.	“Corporal	Meigs,	why	don’t	you	tell	us	in	your	own words	what	happened	on	October	19.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.	Well,	Sergeant	O’Donnell,	our	platoon	sergeant,	rounded	us	up	shortly after	lunch	on	October	19th.	We	had	a	few	people	on	guard	duty,	but	most	of	the platoon	was	in	our	tent,	because	it	was	nasty	wet.	So	Lieutenant	Wingham	called us	into	a	formation	and	briefed	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Major	Collins	nodded,	and	his	red	jowls	shook. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	what	happened	next,	Corporal	Meigs?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	as	usual,	Turville	had	something	to	say.	Wanted	to	know	if	our	orders were	legal,	said	he	didn’t	think	we	was	supposed	to	be	doing	anything	in	the U.S.	or	something.	The	LT	told	him	to	shut	up,	and	we	loaded	up	in	the	truck.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	met	Wharton’s	eyes.  <i class="calibre3">Interesting, </i>	Morris	thought,  <i class="calibre3">but	what	the	hell	did	it</i> <i class="calibre3">mean? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	on,	Corporal,”	said	Collins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	sir,	we	were	set	to	patrol	a	side	street.	The	cops	were	going	from	one apartment	building	to	the	next;	it	was	a	pretty	small,	narrow	street.	So	I	saw	this guy	running,	looked	like	he	had	a	gun.	So	we	all	ducked	down—me	and	Turville squished	into	the	wall,	and	Leo	and	Gomez	hid	behind	a	car.	So	this	guy,	right, he	runs	down	the	alley.	So	I	ask	Leo	to	put	a	couple	of	CS	grenades	into	the alley.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“CS?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p306"></a>“Tear	gas,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	thought	he	detected	a	tone	of	contempt	in	Meigs’s	voice.	How	could	you be	in	the	Army	long	enough	to	be	a	Major	and	not	know	what	tear	gas	was.	Or maybe	it	wasn’t	Meigs;	maybe	Morris	was	just	putting	his	own	spin	on	it.	It	was hard	to	like	someone	who	wanted	to	put	him	in	prison. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	all	put	on	our	masks,	and	Leo	takes	the	shot.	It	went	high,	but	landed	back in	the	alley.	We	hear	this	loud	crash—sounded	like	something	getting	smashed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	this	guy	comes	hauling	ass—excuse	me,	sir—this	guy	comes	running	out	of the	alley.	I	thought	he	had	a	gun;	we	all	did.	I	saw	Turville	raise	his	rifle,	and	I yelled	at	him	not	to	shoot.	But	I	was	too	late.	Turville	took	him	right	in	the chest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	glanced	over	at	the	young	PFC,	who	sat	at	the	next	table	with	his	lawyer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	shook,	and	sunk	his	head	into	his	hands.	His	attorney	placed	a	hand	on his	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At	that	point	we	called	for	help.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Collins	nodded.	He	sat	back	in	his	chair,	his	hands	stuffed	in	his	pockets,	legs splayed	out	in	what	Morris	thought	was	a	very	unmilitary	posture.	Morris glanced	at	Sheeman,	and	was	delighted	to	see	the	colonel	staring	at	Collins disapprovingly.	Collins	didn’t	notice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	Corporal.	Let’s	move	on	a	little.	Where	were	you	when	Captain Morris	arrived	on	the	scene?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meigs—shaking	a	little,	Morris	noticed—answered	quickly.	“I	was	with	the medics,	trying	to	do	something	to	help	the	kid	Turville	shot.	It	was	too	late—the kid	had	a	huge	exit	wound;	he	bled	out	right	there	on	the	street.	When	the	CO</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrived—Captain	Morris,	that	is—the	mother	was	there,	and	the	father,	and	they were	both	hysterical	and	screaming.	Lieutenant	Wingham	and	Sergeant O’Donnell	were	trying	to	keep	the	situation	under	control,	and	then	somebody started	shooting—some	kid,	I	think.	Shot	Frazier	right	in	the	face.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Collins	referred	to	his	notes.	“That’s	Specialist	John	Frazier,	correct?	He	was also	in	your	platoon?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,	same	squad.	Jack	was	pretty	squared	away.	He	must	have	died</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p307"></a>instantly;	asshole	shot	him	right	in	the	face.	I	mean—sorry	sir!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meigs	shifted	in	his	seat	uncomfortably. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Collins	smiled	disarmingly.	“Don’t	worry,	I	think	everyone	in	the	room	has heard	the	term	before.	Please	go	on,	Corporal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	sir,	someone	shot	the	kid	with	the	gun,	right	in	the	gut.	I	think	it	was Private	Nowell,	he	was	Frazier’s	buddy.	So	this	kid	goes	down,	he’s	screaming, the	crowd	was	screaming	and	running,	and	the	kid	looks	to	fire	again.	Someone grabbed	his	gun,	and	next	thing	I	know	this	big-ass—I	mean,	this	brick,	comes crashing	down	right	next	to	me,	blows	up	in	about	a	million	pieces.	I	still	got	a scratch	where	a	hunk	of	it	cut	me	on	the	hand,	see?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	held	his	hand	up	and	pointed	to	a	not-very-impressive	scab.	Of	course,	a couple	of	weeks	had	passed	since	the	incident. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	another	brick	comes	down	and	hits	Sharp	right	in	the	shoulder,	knocks him	down.	Sir,	you	have	no	idea	how	out	of	control	it	was.	I	mean,	it’s	not	like we	were	in	combat;	we	couldn’t	do	anything!	We’re	stuck	there	in	the	street	with the	folks	in	the	neighborhood	coming	down	on	us	like	a	ton	of	bricks,	and	we couldn’t	shoot	back.	Jesus.	So	the	CO,	he	starts	yelling	orders	and	gets	us	out	of there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meigs	went	on,	describing	the	scene	as	they	moved	into	the	center	of	the intersection,	flooding	the	surrounding	streets	and	rooftops	with	tear	gas,	then moved	out	of	the	area	in	what	could	only	be	described	as	a	retreat.	Morris	sat looking	at	the	table,	trying	not	to	make	Meigs	any	more	nervous	than	he	already was.	As	the	prosecutor	wrapped	up,	Wharton	and	Turville’s	attorney	flipped	a coin	to	determine	who	would	ask	questions	first.	Finally,	Wharton	stood	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Corporal	Meigs.	Were	you	at	any	time	given	any	instructions	regarding	your weapon	and	whether	or	not	to	load	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meigs	nodded.	“Yes,	sir.	Lieutenant	Wingham,	sir,	then	Sergeant	O’Donnell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both	made	it	very	clear,	sir,	we	were	not	to	load	our	weapons.	Sergeant O’Donnell	ordered	the	squad	and	team	leaders	to	check	the	weapons	of	our subordinates.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	did	you	do	so?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p308"></a>“Yes,	sir.	I	checked	the	team’s	weapons	before	we	moved	out	of	the	launch point.	All	of	them	were	clear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	the	team,	who	specifically	are	you	referring	to?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meigs	looked	around,	met	Turville’s	eyes	for	a	moment.	He	took	a	deep	breath, then	spoke,	“Three	people,	sir.	PFC	Turville,	PFC	Leo,	and	Specialist	Gomez.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	let	me	make	sure	I	have	this	clear.	When	you	got	off	the	truck	and moved	out	in	the	area,	when	you	first	started	out,	all	the	weapons	in	your	fire team	were	clear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Even	of	tear	gas	grenades.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.	Leo	had	to	load	his	launcher	before	he	could	fire.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.	So,	in	order	to	fire	that	shot,	PFC	Turville	must	have	disobeyed	a	direct order,	and	charged	his	weapon	after	you	verified	it	was	clear,	is	that	not	correct?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.	I	gave	clear	instructions	not	to	lock	and	load.	He	must	have	done	it while	we	were	firing	off	the	tear	gas	or	something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wharton	scribbled	something	on	his	legal	pad,	then	looked	back	up	at	Meigs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	Corporal.	No	more	questions,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	stared	at	his	fingernails.	It	didn’t	sit	quite	right.	His	defense,	as	it	already appeared	to	be	framed	by	his	attorney,	was	dependent	on	proving	that	a	PFC</p>
<p class="calibre1">under	his	command	was	guilty.	Yes,	Turville	had	disobeyed	an	order,	but	Morris wasn’t	comfortable	basing	his	defense	solely	on	that.	He	would	have	to	talk	to Wharton. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	they	finished,	Turville	and	his	lawyer	whispered	urgently	to	each	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Colonel	Sheeman	flashed	an	annoyed	look	at	them,	then	spoke	to	the	officer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain	Harris,	if	you	are	quite	finished.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harris	stood.	“Yes,	sir.	I	have	only	a	few	questions	for	the	witness.	Corporal Meigs,	how	would	you	describe	your	relationship	with	PFC	Turville?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p309"></a>Meigs	shrugged.	“I	wouldn’t,	sir.	We’re	on	the	same	fire	team,	we	work	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	we	don’t	hang	together,	don’t	have	the	same	friends.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harris	paused	briefly	and	looked	at	the	floor.	After	a	brief,	studied	moment,	he spoke	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Corporal,	have	you	ever	used	the	term	‘honky,’	or	‘whitey,’	when	referring	to PFC	Turville?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meigs’s	eyes	widened.	“I	might	have,	sir,	but	I	don’t	recall	a	specific	instance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harris	nodded,	his	bald	head	flashing	under	the	light.	“You	don’t	recall	a	specific instance.	What	about	the	term	‘Turdville.’	Can	you	tell	me	what	precisely	that means?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wharton	sat	up	straight,	a	frown	on	his	face.	“Colonel,	I	don’t	know	where	this is	going.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harris,	expecting	an	objection,	responded	quickly.	“Sir,	my	intentions	will	be quite	clear	in	a	moment.	I’m	concerned	about	the	objectivity	of	this	witness	and would	like	those	concerns	documented	in	the	record.	I	believe	there	may	be	a level	of	personal	antipathy	between	this	witness	and	my	client.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sheeman	looked	at	the	two	of	them,	eyes	narrowed.	“Proceed,	Captain.	Please answer	the	question,	Corporal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	sir,	it’s	like	any	other	nickname	for	one	of	the	new	guys.	There’s	always	a little	hazing	with	a	new	guy	out	of	Basic,	it’s	no	big	deal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	see.	So	what	was	your	nickname	for	PFC	Leo?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I…	I	don’t	have	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t?	Was	Leo	not	like	all	the	other	new	guys?	He’s	been	here	for	a	little over	a	year,	correct?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.	But,	Leo…	Leo	wasn’t	a	screwup,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p310"></a>Morris	grimaced	as	Harris	pounced.	“Oh,	so	PFC	Turville	was	a	screwup.	Can you	give	me	an	instance	of	his	existence	as	a	screwup?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meigs	set	his	jaw	and	his	eyebrows	tightly	scrunched	over	his	eyes.	“Sure,	I	can, sir.	Like	the	first	instance	we	talked	about—when	the	CO	gave	us	a	pass	his	first day	with	the	unit,	and	Turville	goes	outside	the	travel	limit,	comes	back	late from	the	alert.	Or	when	he	dropped	his	rifle	in	the	orderly	room	a	couple	months ago	and	busted	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Harris’s	reply	was	laden	with	sarcasm.	“So	Turville’s	screwups	were worse	than	other	new	recruits?	Is	that	right?	He	screwed	up	much	worse	than Leo,	or	any	other	new	recruits?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meigs	shrugged.	“I	guess	not,	sir.	All	the	new	guys	are	screwups	until	they’ve been	around	for	a	while.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have	you	ever	heard	PFC	Turville	use	the	word	‘nigger?’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,	and	I	was	right	on	him	for	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would	a	squared-away	soldier	ever	use	the	word	‘nigger?’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hell,	no,	sir!	I	don’t	know	who	he	thinks	he	is!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	you	have	a	personal	problem	with	PFC	Turville’s	use	of	the	word,	is	that correct?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meigs	answered.	“Yes,	I	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	he	a	racist?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	did	you	like	having	a	racist	in	your	fire	team?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	like	it	at	all,	sir,	but	it’s	nothin’	new.	Leo’s	a	hillbilly	too,	but	he	doesn’t screw	with	people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	I	don’t	have	any	more	questions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	glanced	at	Sheeman.	The	colonel’s	face	was	red,	his	brow	furrowed,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p311"></a>Morris	realized	he	was	furious.	He	spoke,	his	anger	barely	concealed,	“You	may go,	Corporal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meigs	left	the	room,	and	Sheeman	spoke	again.	“Listen	up.	I	said	this	was	not	a courtroom	and	I	meant	it.	You	will	refrain	from	cross-examining	and	badgering the	witnesses	and	making	arguments	in	this	setting.	We	are	here	to	determine whether	or	not	there	is	enough	evidence	to	warrant	a	court-martial.	That	is	the only	reason	we	are	here.	If	and	when	we	go	to	court-martial	and	you	have	to defend	your	client,	you	can	then	impeach	witnesses	all	day.	Until	then,	we’re here	only	to	establish	the	facts	of	what	happened.	You	are	wasting	my	precious time,	Captain	Harris,	Major	Wharton.	Do	you	understand	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wharton	and	Harris	answered	simultaneously.	“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	it.	I	expect	to	move	expeditiously	through	this	process	so	we	can	come to	a	decision.	We’ll	recess.	I	want	everyone	back	in	here	by	thirteen	hundred hours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sheeman	got	up	and	walked	out	of	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	deflated	as	Wharton	grabbed	him	by	the	arm.	“Come	on,	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	followed	Wharton,	his	body	numb.	He	was	soaked	with	sweat	and	so frustrated	he	wanted	to	smash	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	MP	stood	outside	the	door,	as	well	as	a	young	man	with	somewhat	long,	dirty hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain	Michael	Morris,	sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	Morris	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	young	man	handed	him	a	thick	envelope.	Morris	took	it	reflexively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	man	is	a	process	server,	sir,”	the	MP	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	looked	back	at	the	papers.	He’d	been	served.	Just	great. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks.”	He	walked	away	from	the	MP	and	ripped	open	the	envelope.	Divorce papers	from	Alicia.	He	collapsed	onto	one	of	the	uncomfortable	metal	chairs	in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p312"></a>the	hallway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	it,	Mike?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mike	shook	his	head,	waved	the	papers.	“Divorce	papers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wharton	scoffed.	“Not	having	much	luck	this	month,	are	you?”	He	flopped down	into	the	seat	next	to	Mike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	guess	not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wharton	chuckled.	“Look	at	it	this	way—it	won’t	take	much	in	the	way	of	good news	to	turn	things	around,	will	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	windshield	wipers	on	Karen’s	Hummer	slapped	back	and	forth,	just	enough to	keep	the	road	visible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nearly	two	months	had	passed	since	they’d	been	mobilized.	Nearly	two	months of	incessant	rain,	andremorse	for	Stanson’s	death,	and	agent	Hagarty’s.	Two months	since	she’d	been	relieved	of	her	command. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	had	been	company	commander	for	almost	two	years,	and	had	performed well	during	their	training	exercises	at	Fort	Irwin.	Now,	in	their	first	real deployment,	in	near-combat	conditions,	the	only	things	she’d	managed	to accomplish	was	to	kill	one	of	her	men,	find	herself	under	federal	indictment	and ignite	a	constitutional	crisis.	Some	first	command.	On	top	of	that,	Mike	Morris had	to	show	up	and	profess	his	undying	love	for	her,	the	son	of	a	bitch.	Seven years	without	a	word.	Seven	goddamned	years.	No	wonder	his	wife	hated	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	they	approached	the	armory,	Karen	felt	her	phone	vibrate	and	pulled	it	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking	at	the	caller	ID,	she	saw	it	was	Major	Elkins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	Captain	Greenfield,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain,	as	you	approach	the	armory,	I’d	like	you	to	observe	the	front	gate	and the	several	vehicles	parked	outside.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	leaned	sideways	in	order	to	see	around	the	truck	in	front	of	them.	Half	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p313"></a>block	from	the	armory,	two	cars	idled:	big	neutral-colored,	four-door	sedans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	more	were	at	the	next	corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roger,	sir,	I	see	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	looks	like	we	were	right—they’re	going	to	grab	you	if	you	leave	the	armory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your	transport	awaits	you,	Captain.	I’ll	see	to	it	your	company	is	taken	care	of.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elkins	hung	up	without	another	word,	and	Karen	put	the	phone	away.	They pulled	up	to	the	gate	of	the	armory,	and	she	saw	a	helicopter	on	the	chopper	pad, its	rotors	still	turning.	It	must	have	just	landed.	She	glanced	back	at	one	of	the cars	and	met	the	eyes	of	the	man	who	sat	behind	the	wheel.	He	jerked	up,	then spoke	into	a	handset. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	spoke	to	the	driver,	a	PFC	from	third	platoon	filling	that	role	since Stanson’s	death.	“I	need	you	to	drive	straight	to	the	chopper	pad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	ma’am.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside,	he	broke	away	from	the	convoy	and	drove	straight	toward	the	field	and the	helicopter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elkins	stood	away	from	the	chopper,	waiting	for	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stepped	out	of	the	vehicle,	then	turned	back	and	said	to	the	driver,	“Go ahead	and	rejoin	the	company.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	ma’am.”	He	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	saluted	Elkins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	sir.	Am	I	going	back	to	Charleston?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shook	his	head.	“No,	Brigade	Headquarters	in	Morgantown.	Keep	a	low profile	while	you	are	there.	Not	everyone	on	the	Brigade	staff	agrees	with	the governor’s	decision,	and	Murphy	won’t	be	back	for	a	few	days.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	what	happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p314"></a>“He’s	taking	his	son	down	to	Georgia.	Apparently	the	treatment	program	he	had him	enrolled	in	was	shut	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	a	shame.	I	hope	it	isn’t	serious.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elkins	frowned.	“It	is,	I’m	afraid.	But	enough	said.	Looks	like	those	federal	boys are	just	waiting	for	you	to	walk	out,	and	then	they’ll	nab	you,	huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	guess	so.	Major,	I	don’t	think	I’m	cut	out	to	be	a	fugitive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	worry	about	it,	Karen.	We’ll	get	it	straightened	out.	I	heard	the	grand	jury in	Charleston	issued	indictments	against	the	Director	of	DHS	today,	among others.	They	aren’t	taking	this	lying	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded.	“Well,	so	be	it.	I	guess	it’s	too	late	for	me	to	get	an	absentee	ballot, huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	guess	so.	It’s	just	as	well.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right.	Which	way	are	you	planning	to	vote?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	smiled.	“I’ll	never	tell.	Go	get	on	your	chopper,	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.”	She	stood	at	attention	and	saluted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	returned	the	salute	and	then	walked	back	toward	the	armory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	chopper	crew	chief	took	her	rucksack,	then	helped	her	into	the	harness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain,	if	I’m	not	overstepping	my	bounds,	just	wanted	to	say	we’re	proud	of you	for	defending	your	state.	We	all	saw	the	video	on	TV.	You	did	the	right thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	shocked.	Opening	her	mouth	to	answer,	she	just	couldn’t	think	of	what to	say.	Eventually,	she	said,	“Thanks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	think	he	heard	her	over	the	rotors.	He	handed	her	a	helmet	and	she	put it	on.	The	helicopter	lifted	off. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">November	1</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	funeral	home	was	in	Chamblee,	a	suburb	of	Atlanta	and	not	far	from	the house	where	Murphy	had	grown	up	and	where	his	parents	still	lived.	Valerie rode	in	the	back	seat	next	to	her	unusually	quiet	father,	while	her	grandfather drove. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	down	at	her	phone.	Fifteen	minutes	before,	she’d	gotten	the	page. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	had	made	a	major	speech	in	Charleston	this	morning,	announcing	his opposition	to	the	independence	referendum	and	calling	on	voters	to	oppose	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	had	stepped	in	front	of	a	freight	train,	and	she	was	terribly	afraid	he’d	be run	over.	Everyone	already	knew	he	opposed	the	measure,	but	they	also	knew ninety	percent	of	his	constituents	supported	it.	For	him	to	make	such	a	strong statement	on	the	morning	of	Election	Day	just	didn’t	make	sense.	Maybe	he thought	he	could	turn	the	tide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	what	seemed	like	weeks	of	constant	rain	in	Washington,	it	seemed	strange that	today,	of	all	days,	had	broken	clear	and	warm,	bright	sunlight	washing	down on	the	city.	As	they	pulled	up	to	the	funeral	home—a	nearly	anonymous	red brick	building	with	a	small	portico—she	found	herself	wishing	for	sunglasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	sat,	his	hands	in	his	lap,	and	looked	out	the	window.	He	had	not	said	a word	the	entire	drive,	and	more	frightening,	he’d	barely	looked	around,	not really	responding	to	their	environment	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	grandparents	stepped	out	of	the	car,	and	Valerie	smelled	the	fresh-cut	grass outside.	Murphy	didn’t	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	here,	Dad.”	Her	voice	was	quiet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	eyes	shifted	to	her,	and	for	the	first	time	in	her	life,	Ken	Murphy	looked	old to	Valerie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	sure	I	can	go	in	there.”	His	voice	was	a	whisper. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p316"></a>She	put	her	hand	on	his	back.	“I	know,	Dad.	I	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	closed	his	eyes	for	a	count	of	five	seconds,	and	Valerie	wondered	what	was going	through	his	mind.	Then,	without	a	word,	he	opened	the	car	door	and	got out.	His	back	stiff,	he	walked	toward	his	parents	and	the	entrance	of	the	funeral home,	favoring	his	prosthetic	leg	with	a	slight	limp.	Valerie	slipped	out	of	the	car and	joined	her	family.	Slowly,	the	four	of	them	walked	together	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	the	bright	sunlight,	the	interior	of	the	funeral	home	seemed	dark	and	small. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	narrow,	sterile	hallway	led	down	the	center	of	the	building,	the	floor	a laminated	imitation	wood.	On	each	side	of	the	hallway	lay	dim	chapels,	each with	a	small,	institutional	black	sign	with	white	plastic	letters.	On	the	left, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wilson.”	A	few	people	sat	in	the	pews	on	that	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	right	side,	the	black	sign	read	“Murphy.”	Four	rows	of	pews,	which	could seat	perhaps	thirty	people,	sat	empty,	facing	an	open,	steel	casket	at	the	end	of the	room.	A	man	stood	at	the	casket,	hands	clasped	behind	his	back,	his	back	to the	room,	head	bowed.	As	they	arrived,	he	turned	around	and	approached,	and she	saw	the	Roman	collar.	A	priest.	His	unruly	hair	was	grey,	his	face	was framed	by	a	rough	cut	beard	and	mustache.	He	smiled	as	he	approached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fred	and	Helen.	And	Ken—I	don’t	think	I’ve	seen	you	in	thirty	years.	Welcome home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	thought	her	dad	looked	puzzled,	and	then	his	eyes	widened	and recognition	dawned	on	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie’s	grandmother	said,	“Valerie,	this	is	Father	John	Connelly;	he’s	been	the pastor	at	Holy	Cross	in	Chamblee	for—well,	gosh,	for	forty	years	now.	He married	your	father	and	mother,	you	know.	John,	this	is	Valerie	Murphy,	Ken’s daughter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Father	Connelly	smiled,	and	said	in	a	charming	voice,	“It’s	a	delight	to	meet you,	Valerie.	I’m	very	sorry	about	the	circumstances,	but	it’s	always	a	pleasure to	meet	the	grown	children	of	my	parishioners.	It	makes	me	feel	as	if	I’m	doing something	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	smiled.	“It’s	nice	to	meet	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you,	Ken.	Are	you	holding	up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p317"></a>Murphy	replied,	in	a	voice	so	weary	it	made	her	heart	ache.	“I’m	holding	up, Father.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ken,	you	know	you	can	call	me,	any	time.	I	was	crushed	when	I	heard	about Martha.	You’ve	had	more	than	your	share	of	tragedies.	Please	feel	free	to	call	me if	you	need	to	talk,	collect	if	necessary.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	Father.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	any	other	family	members	coming?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie’s	grandmother	answered,	“Yes,	Lisa	and	her	family	will	be	here,	and	so will	Tom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa	was	Valerie’s	aunt,	younger	than	Murphy.	She	had	two	teenage	children, and	was	married	to	Bobby	Joe	Wright,	a	stockbroker	who	gave	Valerie	the creeps.	Most	years	the	family	gathered	at	her	grandparents’	house	for	Christmas, and	Valerie	had	managed	to	make	it	even	when	she	was	at	Harvard	and	working on	the	Hill.	Somewhere	along	the	road,	she’d	realized	that	Bobby	Joe’s	eyes followed	her	a	lot	closer	than	she	would	have	liked.	But	what	the	hell	was	she supposed	to	say?  <i class="calibre3">Hey,	Dad,	your	brother-in-law	won’t	stop	giving	me	the	eye. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	would	have	broken	Bobby	Joe’s	nose,	and	that	would	have	really	ruined Christmas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	hardly	knew	Tom,	Murphy’s	younger	brother.	She	hardly	knew	him;	he was	a	senior	officer	of	some	kind,	always	on	deployment	in	some	country	or other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	others	quietly	spoke	with	the	pastor,	Valerie’s	eyes	locked	on	the	casket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	broke	away	and	walked	to	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	full	sized	steel	casket	swallowed	up	her	little	brother.	He	lay	there,	his blonde	hair	neatly	combed,	his	hands	crossed	over	his	chest.	He	wore	an unfamiliar	black	suit,	but	she	recognized	the	tie.	She	had	bought	it	for	him	last summer.	It	was	red,	with	small	yellow	dump	trucks	and	bulldozers	crawling	over it.	A	gasp	escaped	her	throat	as	she	recognized	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	he’s	just	a	little	boy,”	she	whispered.	Her	hand	shook	as	she	reached	out	to touch	his	face.	He	was	cold,	cold.	His	cheeks	were	unnaturally	red,	as	if	he’d been	running.	Touching	him,	she	realized	his	face	was	covered	in	pancake</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p318"></a>makeup.	Why?	It	made	him	look	like	a	little	marionette.	Or	did	he	look	so ghastly	when	he	died	that	this	was	the	only	way	to	make	him	presentable? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	looked	up	as	her	Aunt	Lisa	and	her	family	crowded	into	the	room.	Lisa wore	a	black	suit	with	a	tasteless	yellow	shirt.	Her	husband	looked	around	until his	close-set	eyes	rested	on	Valerie,	and	he	smiled.  <i class="calibre3">Pig. </i>	The	teenagers—Bobby, sixteen;	and	Laura,	fourteen—stood	uncomfortably	as	their	parents	greeted	her father	and	their	grandparents.	Lisa	smiled	as	she	shook	Father	Connelly’s	hand, but	Bobby	Joe	looked	at	the	priest	with	suspicion.	Valerie	composed	herself, dabbing	away	tears	with	a	handkerchief,	then	walked,	her	back	straight,	toward her	relatives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa	gripped	her	lightly	by	the	shoulders	and	pressed	her	cheek	to	Valerie’s;	then she	whispered,	“You	must	be	so	broken	up,	Valerie.	Please	let	me	know	if	there’s anything	I	can	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	looked	her	aunt	in	the	eyes	and	smiled.	“Thanks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	tolerated	Bobby	Joe’s	hug	though,	as	usual,	it	was	closer	and	longer	than	she thought	appropriate.	One	of	these	days	somebody	was	going	to	hurt	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	bass	voice	called	out,	“Well,	I’ll	be.	When	did	you	make	Colonel?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie’s	eyes	cut	to	the	door.	Tom	Murphy	stood	at	the	entrance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	smiled.	“Tom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	Valerie,	the	smile	looked	ghastly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	two	of	them	embraced,	clapping	each	other	on	the	back.	Tom	was	also	in	his uniform,	a	sky	blue	braid	looped	under	his	shoulder,	the	silver	eagles	of	a	full Colonel	on	his	shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom	spoke	to	his	brother,	his	voice	cracking,	“Ken,	I’m	so	sorry	about	your boy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	didn’t	reply,	but	to	Valerie’s	eyes,	he	gained	strength	from	the	presence of	his	brother;	he	stood	a	little	taller	maybe,	a	little	more	confident.	They	walked together	to	the	casket,	and	she	felt	a	small	flash	of	jealousy:	He	was	able	to	walk with	his	brother	to	face	this,	but	not	with	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p319"></a> <i class="calibre3">How	petty, </i>	she	thought	immediately.	Her	father	was	in	pain	and	she	was	thinking only	about	herself.	She’d	never	know	what	it	was	like	to	have	a	brother	or	sister stand	beside	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	cousins	stood	awkwardly	as	their	grandparents	fussed	over	Aunt	Lisa	and her	pervert	husband.	Valerie	walked	over	to	the	teens	and	said	hello. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bobby	said,	“Hi”	quietly,	unable	to	take	his	eyes	off	the	coffin	and	his	dead cousin.	Despite	the	suit,	it	was	impossible	to	erase	the	pierced	ear	and	nose,	and the	unkempt	hair,	though	Valerie	was	sure	his	father	would	want	to	do	just	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	must	enrage	his	father,	Valerie	thought	with	satisfaction.	Her	uncle	was	more concerned	with	appearances	than	anyone	she’d	ever	known,	and	had	been	at	war with	his	son	ever	since	Bobby	hit	puberty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Laura,	on	the	other	hand,	was	the	picture	of	conservatism,	with	her	brown	suit and	below-the-knee	skirt.	Valerie	sensed	their	standing	together	was	more	of	an accident	than	not—as	if	they’d	been	deposited	in	one	part	of	the	room	and simply	couldn’t	or	wouldn’t	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	are	you	guys	doing?”	Valerie	asked.	“School	going	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,”	Bobby	said,	“things	are	okay.	I	mean,	I	don’t	think	I’ll	be	going	to Harvard	or	anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’ll	be	lucky	if	he	can	get	into	alternative	school,”	said	his	sister	with	a decidedly	superior	attitude.	She	crossed	her	arms.	“We	just	got	our	midterm report	cards,	and	he’s	failing	two	classes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shut	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dad,”	Her	voice	whined	at	a	pitch	that	almost	hurt	Valerie’s	ears,	“Bobby	told me	to	shut	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	father	stalked	over	and	leaned	his	face	right	into	his	son’s,	trying	for	the intimidating	look	of	a	state	trooper	or	a	drill	sergeant.	“I	thought	I	told	you	to leave	your	sister	alone.	Have	some	God	damned	respect	for	your	cousin	and your	uncle,	why	don’t	you?	What’s	wrong	with	you?	We’re	in	a	God	damned chapel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	caught	Father	Connelly’s	attention,	of	course,	who	looked	at	Bobby	Joe</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p320"></a>with	pain	in	his	eyes.	Bobby	Joe	was	unaware	his	statement	had	caught	not	only the	priest’s	attention,	but	his	motherin-law’s.	Lisa	flushed,	aware	enough	for both	of	them.	More	relatives—cousins	of	Ken’s	and	their	children—had	arrived, just	in	time	to	hear	this	exchange.	A	prince	of	a	man	if	Valerie	had	ever	seen	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,	Dad.	I’ll	try	to	be	more	sensitive.”	Bobby	smiled	as	he	spoke,	his	tone just	on	the	edge	of	insolent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	we’d	better	get	started,”	Father	Connelly	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	don’t	we	do	that,”	Helen	replied,	an	artificial	smile	plastered	on	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	winked	at	her	cousin	Bobby	as	she	turned	away.	He	smiled	genuinely this	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	mass	was	excruciating.	Like	many	uprooted	families,	they	were	burying Kenny	in	a	state	where	virtually	no	one	knew	him,	though	most	of	his	relatives lived	here.	Valerie	had	been	raised	in	a	largely	non-religious	household,	but	she tried	to	be	sensitive	to	other’s	religious	needs,	especially	her	grandparents,	who were	devout	Catholics.	But	the	mass…it	went	on	and	on,	a	ritual	Valerie	didn’t understand	and	didn’t	care	about.	For	her,	going	to	church	had	been	restricted	to summer	vacations	when	she	visited	her	grandparents	for	three	weeks	out	of	the year.	Neither	of	her	parents	had	attended	churches,	though	her	mother,	Martha, was	raised	a	Lutheran,	and	Murphy	had	grown	up	Catholic.	As	a	teenager	she’d envied	some	of	her	friends,	who’d	been	involved	in	church	groups	and	activities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	now	though,	especially	not	sitting	through	a	mass	for	her	poor	brother,	who wouldn’t	have	understood	it	anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bobby	and	Laura	were	used	to	it.	Their	parents,	Bobby	Joe	and	Lisa,	never missed	a	chance	to	sit	in	church:	Bobby	Joe	was	a	Southern	Baptist,	and	had pushed	his	wife	into	converting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Afterward,	they	moved	to	the	cemetery,	halfway	around	town.	Anxious	motorists cut	into	the	funeral	procession	several	times	as	they	drove	around	the	perimeter highway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	sat	numb,	shivering	from	the	chilly	breeze,	during	the	ceremony	at	the gravesite.	Her	only	connection	with	reality,	tenuous	as	it	was,	was	her	father, who	sat	beside	her	holding	her	hand.	The	coffin	and	two	small	rows	of	chairs were	shaded	by	a	tent	stretched	above	their	heads.	The	cemetery,	spread	across</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p321"></a>gently	rolling	hills,	surrounded	them	on	all	sides.	A	slight	breeze	moved	through her	hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	mechanical	apparatus	lowered	the	coffin	into	the	ground,	her	father shook.	Valerie	looked	over	at	him.	His	face	was	stone,	his	jaw	set,	but	she	could feel	him	shaking,	his	entire	body,	almost	as	if	her	were	suffering	from	a	seizure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	shaking	became	apparent	to	the	others	as	his	marksmanship	medals,	hanging on	his	chest	below	his	campaign	ribbons,	began	to	rattle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	heard	someone	whisper	behind	her,	and	even	Father	Connelly	looked	up at	the	sound	of	the	metallic	rattling.	Tom	put	his	hand	on	Murphy’s	shoulder	and whispered	something	to	him.	Whatever	he	said—and	Valerie	tried	her	best	to hear,	but	couldn’t—it	stopped	the	shaking.	Then	it	was	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	father	lingered	at	the	edge	of	the	grave,	Tom	on	one	side,	arm	over	his shoulder.	She	wanted	to	cry	as	she	saw	his	face	distort	with	pain,	tears	rolling down	his	cheeks.	He	reached	into	his	pocket	and	brought	out	what	looked	like	a ribbon,	and	she	gasped	when	she	realized	what	it	was.	Mom	told	her	a	hundred times	about	her	senior	prom,	when	Dad	had	proposed.	She	had	carefully	pressed and	dried	the	corsage	he	gave	her	that	night,	eventually	framing	it	and	keeping	it in	her	study.	Valerie	hadn’t	seen	it	since	Mom	died.	He	must	have	been	keeping it	with	him	all	this	time,	because	that	was	what	he	held	in	his	hand,	the	blue ribbon	trailing	off	in	the	wind.	He’d	tied	the	ribbon	around	his	wedding	ring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	face	twisted,	and	Tom	held	him	close.	She	faintly	heard	the	words	he	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Goodbye,	Martha.	I	loved	you.	Goodbye,	little	guy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	sobbed	at	the	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	kissed	the	corsage	and	then	threw	it	in.	The	wedding	ring	bounced	with	a loud	pop	when	it	hit	the	coffin.	Murphy	stood	over	it,	eyes	closed,	then	turned and	stumbled	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p322"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	Twenty-Eight</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">November	1</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Second	Brigade	Headquarters	was	located	in	Morgantown,	West	Virginia,	just outside	of	town	where	there	was	sufficient	room	for	the	motor	pool	and	training facilities.	A	new	three-story	building,	it	had	replaced	the	old,	dilapidated headquarters	three	years	before.	Woods	surrounded	the	facility,	but	a	seventy-five-foot	buffer	had	recently	been	cleared	of	trees	between	the	fence	and	the woods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under	normal	circumstances,	the	headquarters	was	guarded	by	a	bored	private security	guard,	typically	sitting	in	the	booth	at	the	front	gate,	not	even	bothering to	walk	a	circuit	or	patrol	the	motor	pool.	Things	were	a	little	different	now	that Captain	Karen	Greenfield,	a	wanted	federal	fugitive,	had	arrived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	platoons	of	infantry	were	now	assigned	the	task	of	guarding	the	facility. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	men	in	the	infantry	company,	primarily	unemployed	coal	miners	from	the economically	devastated	Logan	County,	were	happy	to	have	been	activated,	as the	work	was	bringing	in	good	money	for	what	was,	in	reality,	not	that	bad	a	job. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Guard	duty	might	be	boring,	but	it	was	a	damn	site	better	than	no	work	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First	Lieutenant	Austin	Robear	was	in	charge	of	the	guard	detail.	He	had assigned	one	platoon	to	secure	the	building	itself,	including	the	entrances,	roof and	approaches	from	the	front	gate.	The	perimeter,	including	the	front	gate	and the	motor	pool,	were	guarded	by	the	second	platoon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	moment,	Robear	sat	in	the	office	he’d	been	assigned,	his	feet	up	on	the desk	as	he	listened	to	the	game	on	the	radio.	His	eyes	were	closed,	but	he	was wide	awake,	his	adrenaline	pumping	every	time	the	Eagles	got	the	ball. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Black	Six,	Black	Six,	this	is	White	Three,	over.”	There	was	panic	in	the	voice of	the	caller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Robear	jerked	upright	at	the	radio	call,	then	keyed	his	own	headset. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	ahead,	White	Three,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p323"></a>“Black	Six,	we	have	six	unmarked	vehicles	approaching	the	facility	at	this	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	have	extra	antennas,	appear	to	be	federal	vehicles.	They	are	coming	up from	town,	ETA	two	minutes,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roger,	White	Three.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Robear	called	his	two	platoon	leaders,	alerting	them	to	scramble	their	off-duty people	into	position.	He	then	stood,	put	on	his	helmet	and	web	gear,	and	headed for	the	front	door	while	making	another	call,	this	one	to	the	acting	brigade commander. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	Lieutenant	Colonel	Chang,”	he	heard	the	gruff	voice	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	this	is	Lieutenant	Robear.	My	people	report	we	have	a	group	of	what	may be	federal	vehicles	approaching.	Six	unmarked	vehicles	approaching	from	town, sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,	Lieutenant.	Keep	me	informed,	please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wilco,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Robear	reached	the	front	gate,	which	was	closed	and	barred,	at	the	same	time that	the	vehicles	arrived.	The	first	of	the	cars	pulled	up	to	the	gate.	One	of	his men—Private	Wilson—approached	the	lead	vehicle	from	the	tiny	guard	shack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind	the	first	car,	the	other	five	pulled	into	positions	just	across	the	street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Men	poured	out	of	the	vehicles.	Licking	his	lips,	Robear	approached,	walking through	the	guard	shack	toward	the	first	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	the	passenger	side	stepped	a	large	man,	wearing	a	black	suit	and	tie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lieutenant,	are	you	in	charge	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	in	charge	of	the	security	detail,	yes,	sir,”	Robear	answered.	“I’m	afraid	you men	are	trespassing	and	must	leave	immediately.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	walked	closer	to	Robear.	“Lieutenant,	my	name	is	Bob	Newman.	I’m the	Special	Agent	in	Charge	of	the	FBI	Field	Office	in	Cincinnatti.	This	is	a federal	search	warrant	for	this	facility.”	He	held	up	a	folded	sheet	of	paper. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p324"></a>“May	I	see	it?”	Robear	asked,	stalling	for	time.	His	could	feel	his	pulse	in	his neck,	an	interesting	sensation,	if	unpleasant.	The	agent	impatiently	handed	over the	papers,	and	Robear	slowly	and	neatly	took	them	out	of	the	envelope	and unfolded	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Robear	almost	chuckled	as	he	looked	at	the	legalese	covering	the	page.	He’d never	looked	at	a	warrant	in	his	life	and	wouldn’t	know	whether	it	was	valid	or not.	All	the	same,	he	had	a	job	to	do.	He	read	over	it	carefully,	and	very	slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	moment,	he	handed	it	back.	“Sir,	I’m	afraid	this	warrant	may	not	have jurisdiction	over	this	facility.	I’m	going	to	have	to	ask	you	to	take	this	to	the	state attorney	general	and	National	Guard	Bureau	in	Charleston,	so	they	can determine	if	you	will	be	allowed	in	the	facility.	I	can’t	do	it	on	my	own.	Once	I get	an	order	from	my	commanding	officer	indicating	I	have	to	let	you	in,	I	will be	happy	to	do	so.	Until	then,	I’m	going	to	have	to	ask	you	to	leave immediately.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lieutenant,	if	that	gate	isn’t	open	in	thirty	seconds,	I’ll	have	my	men	place	you under	arrest	for	obstruction	of	justice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	see,”	Robear	said,	his	heart	thumping	wildly.	He	keyed	his	radio	and	spoke into	the	handset.	“Blue	Six,	White	Six,	this	is	Black	Six,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both	platoon	leaders	responded	immediately.	The	agent’s	mouth	fell	open	as	he heard	the	next	order. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	make	sure	your	men	are	locked	and	loaded	at	this	time,	over.	The	rules of	engagement	are	as	we	discussed	in	our	briefing.	Acknowledge,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	spoke,	everyone	within	fifty	yards	heard	the	distinctive	crack	of	M16</p>
<p class="calibre1">rifles	being	loaded.	Much	more	frightening	to	the	men	across	the	street, however,	was	the	appearance	of	a	crew-served	machine	gun	mounted	on	a tripod,	sitting	in	one	of	the	windows	of	the	headquarters	building.	The	federal agents	across	the	street	ducked	behind	their	vehicles,	except	the	one	at	the	gate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lieutenant,	you	don’t	want	to	do	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	are	right,	sir.	I	don’t	want	to	do	this.	May	I	recommend	you	quickly	vacate the	premises,	before	this	goes	somewhere	neither	of	us	want.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p325"></a>“Now	wait	just	a	goddamn	minute,”	shouted	Newman.	“You	are	obstructing	a federal	investigation.	Open	this	gate	right	this	minute.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Corporal	Caldwell,”	Robear	called	into	the	guard	shack.	Caldwell	called	back, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Place	these	gentlemen	under	arrest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Caldwell	and	the	three	other	men	of	his	fire	team	immediately	stepped	out	of	the guard	shack,	their	weapons	pointed	at	Newman	and	the	driver	of	the	vehicle, who	hadn’t	spoken	as	of	yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Step	out	of	the	car,	sir,”	one	of	the	rifleman	shouted	to	the	driver.	“Hands	in	the air.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Caldwell	walked	up	to	Newman.	“Hands	up.	Now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Newman	slowly	raised	his	hands	in	the	air.	As	he	did	so,	five	of	the	agents across	the	street	broke	away	from	their	vehicles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Newman,	tell	your	men	to	halt	or	we	will	open	fire.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	shit,”	the	driver	of	the	car	muttered	as	one	of	the	riflemen	took	his	weapon and	cleared	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop!”	Newman	shouted.	“Don’t	come	any	closer,	I	think	they’re	serious.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	agents	ignored	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get	in	the	shack	now,”	Caldwell	shouted,	and	shoved	Newman	ahead	of	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Robear	keyed	his	radio	set	to	call	the	machine	gun	team.	“Max	One,	Max	One, this	is	Black	Six.	If	those	agents	cross	the	yellow	line,	fire	a	burst	over	their heads.	Make	sure	you	don’t	hit	anybody,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wilco,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Almost	immediately,	a	burst	of	machine	gun	fire	plowed	into	the	hillside	behind the	agents,	all	of	whom	dropped	to	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Goddammit,”	Newman	cursed.	“Do	you	have	any	idea	what	you	are	doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p326"></a>His	face	was	bright	red	as	he	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,	I	do.	Now	get	on	the	ground	and	shut	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Newman	did	as	he	was	told. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Robear	called	the	Colonel	to	report.	Shortly	after,	the	news	vans	pulled	up	to report	on	the	latest	chain	of	events. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	morning,	three	major	items	were	plastered	over	the	front	page	of newspapers	across	the	country.	In	the	first,	in	elections	across	America,	far-right candidates—many	of	them	sympathetic	to	the	West	Virginian	cause—had	been elected,	changing	the	majorities	in	both	the	House	and	the	Senate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Representative	Albert	Clark	of	West	Virginia	was	resoundingly	defeated	by	a little-known,	badly	funded	Republican	Party	candidate.	Pundits	on	all	side credited	his	defeat	to	his	last	minute	announcement	that	he	was	opposed	to	the independence	referendum—a	referendum	which	passed	in	his	district	by	a	wide margin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	second	item,	several	Federal	agents	had	been	arrested	by	National	Guard forces	in	Morgantown,	West	Virginia.	The	DHS	and	the	National	Guard	were	at a	standoff	in	Morgantown,	with	increasing	numbers	of	federal	agents surrounding	the	National	Guard	compound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	final,	and	perhaps	most	important	item	was	that	in	a	landslide	vote, Proposition	12	passed	in	West	Virginia,	granting	the	legislature	the	power	to secede	West	Virginia	from	the	United	States. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	morning,	State	Representative	Brian	Warfield	of	Logan	County introduced	a	bill	in	the	State	House	of	Representatives	calling	for	the	immediate secession	of	West	Virginia	from	the	United	States.	Later	that	day,	Governor Frank	Slagter	ordered	the	activation	of	the	state	National	Guard. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p327"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	Twenty-Nine</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">November	2</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	military	helicopter	flew	across	the	landscape	just	above	treetop	level,	the turbine	engine	screaming.	Murphy	stared	at	the	front	of	the	cabin,	and	paid	little attention	to	the	shake	of	the	chopper	and	the	thump	of	the	rotors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	interesting	that	in	the	absence	of	any	orders,	the	pilot	violated	a	number	of peacetime,	stateside	rules	about	where	and	how	military	helicopters	were	flown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nap-of-the-earth	flight	might	be	normal	for	combat	zones,	but	it	wasn’t	for ferrying	around	the	brass	in	West	Virginia.	Several	times	the	pilot	took	them between	the	mountains	instead	of	over	them,	and	Murphy	caught	his	breath	more than	once	as	they	flew	meters	over	power	lines.	He	did	not	correct	the	pilot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	weren’t	at	war	yet,	but	might	be	soon	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	pilot,	an	Air	National	Guard	major,	tried	to	make	small	talk	twice,	then	gave up	and	looked	away.	Murphy	replied	in	monosyllabic	responses.	He	didn’t	mean to	be	unfriendly;	he	just	didn’t	feel	like	talking.	He	found	it	easier	to	stare	out	the window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	the	funeral	yesterday	the	whole	family	had	returned	to	his	parents’	home.	It was	a	maudlin,	depressing	dinner.	Afterward,	Valerie	insisted	on	turning	on	the television,	and	they	all	learned,	in	the	worst	way	possible,	that	she	would	soon be	out	of	a	job.	Bobby	Joe	didn’t	let	the	dust	settle	before	he	suggested	she	move to	Atlanta,	and	Murphy	had	to	take	a	deep	breath	and	settle	down.	Nothing infuriated	him	more	than	his	brother-in-law’s	fawning	attention	to	Valerie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom	scoffed	at	the	news	that	West	Virginia	passed	the	independence	referendum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	did	they	think?	They’d	field	the	National	Guard	against	the	U.S.	Army? </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	exactly	what	they	think,	Murphy	replied,	sparking	a	loud	and	blessedly distracting	discussion.	He	and	his	brother	argued,	in	significant	detail,	the readiness	of	the	National	Guard	compared	to	active	duty	units,	especially	those units—like	Tom’s—that	had	recently	been	overseas.	By	the	time	they	finished, everyone	else	in	the	family	was	rolling	their	eyes	and	trying	to	change	the subject.	They	all	avoided	the	topic	of	whether	Murphy	would	stay	in	command of	the	brigade,	though	Murphy	knew	full	well	his	family	expected	him	to	resign. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p328"></a>Some	things	you	just	couldn’t	talk	about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	a	job	to	do.	Whatever	the	assembly	decided,	Murphy	had	to	get	his brigade	prepared	to	fight	a	defense,	in	the	event	it	did	come	to	a	shooting	war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	prayed	it	wouldn’t.	Things	were	bad	enough	already. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir?	We	may	have	a	problem.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy’s	eyes	shifted	to	the	pilot,	and	he	paused,	almost	imperceptibly.	“What is	it,	Major?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	got	an	escort.	Two	choppers	from	the	DHS.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wave	to	them	and	keep	going.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	pilot	did	just	that:	he	leaned	forward	and	waved	at	a	chopper	flying	two hundred	meters	to	their	left.	Murphy	couldn’t	see	the	reaction	of	the	escorting pilots,	but	somehow	he	was	sure	it	couldn’t	be	good.	This	situation	had	to change.	They	could	not	continue	an	ongoing	confrontation	outside	his	brigade headquarters.	Maybe	he	could	sneak	Captain	Greenfield	out	in	the	chopper.	No. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anywhere	he	sent	her,	they’d	be	sure	to	find	her,	and	at	least	at	Brigade	he	had some	control	and	could	keep	the	feds	from	hauling	her	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	couldn’t	think	of	much	of	anything	that	exemplified	the	recent	stupidity	of the	federal	government	than	moving	to	try	her	on	capital	charges.	Or	cutting funding	for	a	desperately	needed	medical	trial	when	the	patients	were	likely	to die.	Or	sending	federal	agents	into	a	city	to	round	up	people	in	the	street.	Or sending	combat	troops	to	intervene	in	a	labor	dispute.	The	federal	government had	demonstrated	its	incompetence	at	almost	every	turn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Below,	the	brigade	headquarters	compound	came	into	view.	On	the	rooftop,	he could	see	anti-aircraft	guns	and	missile	teams.	What	looked	to	be	two	platoons of	infantry	were	dug	into	new	emplacements	all	around	the	site,	and	Bradley fighting	vehicles	were	also	positioned	in	various	locations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	outside	of	the	site	there	were	twenty-five	or	so	police	cars	and	vans,	plus armored	vehicles—half-a-dozen	Bradleys	and	some	engineer	vehicles.	Murphy grimaced.	It	wouldn’t	take	much	to	turn	this	situation	into	an	inferno. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p329"></a>After	the	chopper	touched	down	on	the	helicopter	pad,	Murphy	said,	“Thanks, Major.	Please	be	ready	to	go	to	Charleston	later	today;	I’m	probably	going	to need	to	meet	with	General	Peak	and	the	governor	before	the	end	of	the	day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	stepped	down	from	the	helicopter	and	bent	low	as	he	walked	out	from under	the	still	turning	rotors.	He	pulled	his	overcoat	tighter;	it	was	damn	cold out.	As	he	walked	off	the	helicopter	pad,	Lieutenant	Colonel	Jian	Chang,	his executive	officer,	ran	out	to	meet	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chang	saluted	as	Murphy	approached,	and	Murphy	returned	the	salute.	Unlike Murphy	in	his	dress	uniform,	Chang	wore	battle	fatigues,	complete	with	helmet and	pistol	belt.	Murphy	felt	uncomfortable	with	the	need	for	combat	gear	under the	current	circumstances,	but	then	again,	it	wouldn’t	surprise	him	if	whoever ran	the	show	for	DHS	decided	on	some	idiot	scheme	to	storm	the	compound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	turned	to	walk	into	the	building.	As	the	door	opened,	Murphy	felt	a cushion	of	warm	air	hit	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Colonel,	I	was	very	sorry	to	hear	about	your	son.	My	condolences.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	Jan.”	Murphy	changed	the	subject.	“What’s	the	situation	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	good,	sir.	We	have	a	growing	contingent	of	federal	police	outside, including	some	armored	vehicles.	They’ve	periodically	tried	calling	on	our people	to	surrender,	threatening	them	with	treason	charges,	but	no	one	is budging.	I’ll	be	honest	with	you,	sir.	I’m…	very	surprised;	we’ve	had	absolutely no	one	who	wanted	to	walk	away	from	this	situation,	so	far	as	I	can	see.	Don’t take	this	the	wrong	way	sir,	but	I	called	the	men	together	yesterday	and	offered them	the	opportunity	to	resign	and	walk	away	with	no	prejudice.	No	one	went. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	any	event,	we	currently	have	three	prisoners;	they	are	being	held	in	very comfortable	conditions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have	they	been	given	the	opportunity	to	meet	with	attorneys?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	stopped	walking	for	a	moment	and	turned	to	the	other	officer.	“Jan, you’re	not	going	to	like	this,	but	we	need	to	try	to	diffuse	this	situation.	I	want	to meet	with	those	men,	and	then	we’re	going	to	release	them.	We’re	not	going	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p330"></a>do	what	they’ve	been	doing.	Take	me	to	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	moments	later,	they	walked	into	a	small	conference	room.	A	large	man with	a	broad,	flushed	face	stood	as	they	entered.	Two	other	men	at	the	far	side	of the	table	remained	seated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	long	are	we	going	to	be	held	here?”	he	demanded	as	the	officers	entered the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	any	longer.	I’m	Colonel	Ken	Murphy;	I’m	the	brigade	commander	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	facing	him	gave	him	a	withering	look,	before	responding.	“Then	you have	a	lot	to	answer	for,	Colonel	Murphy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	frowned.	“What’s	your	name?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	Bob	Newman.	I’m	the	Special	Agent	in	Charge	for	the	FBI’s	Field	Office in	Cincinatti.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	Mr.	Newman,”	Murphy	said.	“Here’s	how	we’re	going	to	do	this.	I’m going	to	talk,	and	you’re	going	to	listen.	Then	you	are	going	to	walk	out	of	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Understand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Newman’s	face	twisted	as	if	he	wanted	to	respond	much	more	violently.	Instead, he	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.	I	don’t	want	any	bloodshed,	understand?	In	case	you	didn’t	notice	by	the lopsided	election	results,	the	federal	government	isn’t	all	that	popular	around here.	It’s	going	to	make	things	a	lot	worse	if	your	trigger-happy	boys	start	a battle	against	a	brigade	of	the	National	Guard.	Do	you	get	that?	Do	you	want	to fire	the	opening	shots	of	a	civil	war?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Newman	did	not	respond. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	take	that	as	a	no.	Good	news	is,	I	don’t	want	to,	either.	So,	here’s	what	I want.	I	want	you	to	walk	out	of	here,	and	I	want	your	people	to	back	off	a	couple hundred	meters	from	the	compound.	Let’s	ease	the	tension	here,	so	no	one	does anything	stupid,	okay?	I	don’t	need	one	of	my	guards	spooking	at	three	a.m.	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p331"></a>opening	fire.	Neither	do	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Newman	nodded.	“Anything	else,	Colonel?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	I’ve	got	a	pretty	good	feeling	somewhere	in	Washington	some	bureaucrat who	has	never	looked	down	the	business	end	of	a	gun	barrel	is	planning	to conduct	some	kind	of	strike	on	this	place	to	arrest	Captain	Greenfield.	Newman, make	sure	they	put	that	out	of	their	minds.	These	aren’t	unarmed	factory	workers here;	these	are	trained	and	determined	soldiers,	and	you	don’t	want	a	battle.	Let’s allow	this	thing	to	work	its	way	through	the	legislature	or	the	courts	or	whatever, and	then	we	can	all	walk	away	from	this	situation	alive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	Colonel.	I	agree	with	you,	and	I’ll	pass	that	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	turned	to	Lieutenant	Colonel	Chang.	“Colonel	Chang,	can	you	have someone	escort	these	men	out	of	the	compound.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	minutes	later,	the	men	were	escorted	out	of	the	building,	and	Ken	went	to look	for	his	office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Clouds	of	white	mist	appeared	around	Mike	Morris	as	he	exhaled,	and	he	pulled his	coat	tighter	around	him.	Another	cold	spell	had	set	in,	making	for	what	had been	one	hell	of	a	cold	autumn.	He	dreaded	winter	this	year,	if	it	was	already	this cold.	The	sun	was	just	setting	behind	the	trees	on	the	other	side	of	the	desolate parade	ground,	stretching	the	shadows	out	into	long,	distorted	shapes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	walked	across	the	field,	head	held	low	in	the	event	any	reporters	were	about, and	reached	the	back	door	of	the	battalion	headquarters.	Locked.	He’d	forgotten they	usually	locked	the	back	and	side	entrances	at	six.	He	walked	around	the side,	still	hunched	over	in	his	coat,	and	walked	in	the	front	door.	A	news	van	was parked	out	front.	He	was	surprised—he	would	have	expected	them	to	lose interest	in	favor	of	the	election	the	day	before.	No	such	luck,	but	no	one	got	out of	the	van	as	he	walked	into	the	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	feet	echoed	on	the	floor	with	a	dull,	flat	sound	when	he	entered	the	building, crossed	the	empty	entryway	to	Lieutenant	Colonel	Barksdale’s	office	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p332"></a>knocked	on	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Enter.”	Barksdales	voice	was	muffled	by	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	opened	it	and	stepped	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	in,	Captain,	sit	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	sir,”	Morris	replied	stiffly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	are	you	making	out	with	the	Article	32	investigation?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	bad,	sir.	My	attorney	thinks	there	is	a	good	chance	this	thing	will	be dropped	before	it	goes	to	court-martial,	and	if	it	isn’t,	almost	no	chance	I’ll	be convicted.	It’s	a	relief.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,	good.	That’s	actually	why	I	called	you	over	here,	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.”	Morris	straightened	in	his	chair,	his	stomach	tensing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	discussed	this	thing	with	the	brigade	commander,	the	whole	issue	with	the Article	32	hearing,	the	possible	court-martial.	The	way	I	see	it,	Captain,	it’s	bad for	discipline.	This	is	nothing	personal,	but	your	company	is	suffering	because	of it.	I	don’t	want	to	see	that.	Especially	if	we	end	up	going	to	fight	some	hillbillies up	in	West	Virginia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	stirred	in	his	seat	uneasily.	“Sir,	rest	assured,	my	men	will	be	in	the	best possible	training	should	we	deploy.	I’ll	ensure	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	exactly	are	you	going	to	accomplish	that,	with	you	stuck	in	hearings	all the	time?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	felt	panic	setting	in.	Barksdale	was	going	to	relieve	him.	He’d	known	this was	coming;	it	was	just	a	question	of	when. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	the	Article	32	investigation	will	be	over	by	Friday.	Then	we	just	wait	for the	report.	I	can	see	your	point	if	it	comes	to	a	court-martial,	but	that’s	not	very likely	at	this	point.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barksdale	frowned.	“I	see.	All	the	same,	I’m	not	comfortable	with	this.	I	won’t</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p333"></a>formally	relieve	you—not	yet.	We’ll	place	you	on	a	leave	status	until	you’ve either	been	cleared	or	until	they	announce	a	court-martial,	and	your	XO	can assume	command	for	the	time	being.	But	let	me	be	clear,	Captain.	If	it	comes	to a	court-martial,	I’ll	be	forced	to	relieve	you	of	your	command.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	hated	the	tone	of	his	voice,	even	as	he	spoke.	“Sir,	doesn’t	the	principle of	innocent	until	proven	guilty	apply?	You	were	there,	sir.	You	know	what happened.	Why	should	my	career	be	derailed	when	I	haven’t	even	been convicted	of	anything?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	couldn’t	have	found	anything	worse	to	say.	Barksdale	looked	at	him,	his	face frozen,	eyes	narrow.	“It’s	not	about	you,	Captain	Morris.	It’s	about	the	good	of your	company.	I	don’t	give	a	rat’s	ass	if	it’s	fair	to	you,	but	if	your	company suffers	and	people	die	because	you	are	too	busy	defending	yourself	in	court, we’ve	got	a	problem.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barksdale	paused,	visibly	trying	to	control	his	anger,	then	he	spoke	again.	“You know,	that’s	what	I	don’t	like	about	you,	Morris.	It’s	all	about	you	and	your career.	Not	once	have	I	heard	you	express	concern	about	that	boy	who	was killed,	or	even	your	men	who	were	killed.	Not	once	have	I	heard	you	ask	how Private	Turville	is	doing.	But,	of	course,	your	defense	rests	on	his	guilt,	isn’t	that right?	I’d	rather	see	you	answer,	‘No	excuse,’	and	take	the	consequence	than	see what	I’m	seeing	now.	It’s	despicable	that	you	would	base	your	defense	on screwing	one	of	your	subordinates.”	Morris	almost	physically	shrank	into	his chair	as	Barksdale	pointed	his	finger	at	him.	“Captain,	you	may	walk	away	from this.	You	may	be	cleared	by	the	Article	32	investigation,	and	resume	command of	your	company.	But	I	tell	you	this:	in	my	eyes,	you	are	already	done.	As	an officer	and	as	a	man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	what	I’m	expected	to	say	at	this	point,	sir,”	Mike	said.	“It	looks	as if	you’ve	made	up	your	mind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	if	I’m	unofficially	losing	command	of	my	company,	I’d	like	to	request	a couple	of	weeks’	leave	to	go	to	Kentucky	and	see	my	daughter	over	Christmas.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Denied.	You	can	sit	around	here	and	find	out	whether	or	not	you’re	going	to	be court-martialed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p334"></a>“Sir,	I	haven’t	seen	my	daughter	since	before	we	deployed	to	West	Virginia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	should	have	thought	about	that	before	you	became	in	infantry	officer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dismissed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	stumbled	out	of	the	office,	fists	clenched,	his	mind	clouded.	Barksdale’s comment	was	a	bitter	reminder	of	similar	words	he’d	said	to	Alicia	in	the	spring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	colonel	was	right	about	Turville,	too:	Morris	had	never	been	comfortable with	that	line	of	defense	in	the	first	place—never	mind	that	it	was	the	truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	went	to	the	back	door	of	the	battalion	in	hopes	of	avoiding	reporters,	but	it was	too	late.	As	he	stepped	out	of	the	back	door,	a	reporter	and	a	photographer appeared	in	his	path. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain	Morris,	I’m	Ron	Reid	from	Newsweek.	We’re	putting	together	a	story about	you	and	Captain	Karen	Greenfield	in	West	Virginia.	Would	you	care	to comment?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	wouldn’t.	Please	get	out	of	my	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	it	true,	sir,	that	your	wife	and	daughter	left	to	go	back	to	your	father-in-law?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	none	of	your	business.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	Representative	Skaggs	is	a	very	important	congressman.	Is	he	supporting you	in	your	defense?	It’s	curious	he	hasn’t	spoken	up	about	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mike	lost	his	temper.	“It’s	not	at	all	curious,	all	right?	And	my	relationship	with my	wife	and	her	father	is	none	of	your	goddamn	business,	and	none	of	your magazine’s	goddamn	business,	and	none	of	the	public’s	goddamn	business!	Got it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	sir,	we’ve	been	told	by	sources	your	wife	left	because	of	your	involvement with	Captain	Greenfield	while	you	were	in	Charleston.	We’ve	got	several statements	placing	the	two	of	you	together	in	West	Virginia.	And	you	dated	in college	for	what,	three	years?	We’ve	got	photographs.	And	then,	to	have	both incidents	occur	the	way	they	did—don’t	you	think	it’s	an	incredible coincidence?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	the	hell	is	wrong	with	you?	Is	it	your	job	to	ruin	people’s	lives?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p335"></a>“Well,	sir,	I	didn’t	shoot	a	kid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Neither	did	I.	Get	the	hell	out	of	my	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	shoved	the	reporter	out	of	his	way	and	continued	walking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Morris!	We’re	running	the	story	whether	or	not	you	talk.	Don’t	you	think	it’s better	you	get	your	side	on	the	table?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’d	be	better	if	you	were	in	hell.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	walked	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	morning	after	her	brother’s	funeral,	Valerie	caught	her	breath	as	she	came out	of	the	lee	of	the	South	Capitol	Metro	station	and	the	icy	wind	slapped	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	pulled	her	overcoat	tight	around	her,	wishing	to	God	she	could	wear	a	good pair	of	jeans	to	the	office	instead	of	this	damn	skirt.	It	didn’t	matter	if	she	was	a senior	aide	to	a	senior	congressman—she	still	had	to	wear	goddamn	outfits	that left	too	little	to	the	imagination.	The	same	old	litany	ran	through	her	mind	as	she walked	toward	the	office.	Because	only	pretty	girls	got	jobs	on	the	Hill. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Won’t	matter	much	longer, </i>	she	supposed.	She	wouldn’t	be	working	here	more than	another	month	or	two.	With	Al	Clark’s	surprise	defeat,	she	didn’t	have	a clue	what	to	do	next. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	staff	entrance	to	the	Rayburn	Building,	she	dropped	her	purse	on	the	X-ray	machine	and	walked	through	the	metal	detectors.	Long	experience	had taught	her	not	to	bother	coming	to	work	with	anything	in	her	pockets;	all	of	it went	in	the	purse,	so	she	didn’t	have	to	mess	with	emptying	them	every	time	she entered	the	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	office	was	like	a	graveyard.	Too	many	changes	had	come,	too	quickly,	and the	staff	was	in	shock.	Virtually	no	one	was	in	the	office	when	she	arrived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ambrose,	in	a	well-tailored	brown	suit,	was	already	sitting	with	Clark	in	the boss’s	office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on	in,”	Clark	said.	He	waved	his	arm	in	a	vague	gesture. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p336"></a>She	walked	in,	the	clicking	of	her	heels	abruptly	muted	on	the	carpet	as	she walked	into	the	office.	Clark	leaned	back	on	his	couch,	his	jacket	off,	a	cup	of coffee	in	his	hand.	Valerie	sat	down	and	dropped	her	purse	next	to	the	chair,	then smoothed	out	her	skirt.	A	moment	later	she	looked	up	at	her	boss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	are	you	doing,	Al?	I	couldn’t	believe	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	shrugged.	“I’ll	be	fine,	as	soon	as	Ambrose	stops	giving	me	those	‘I	told you	so’	looks.	Right	now	we	need	to	find	jobs	for	all	of	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	glanced	between	the	two,	a	question	in	her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ambrose	spoke.	“Governor	Slagter	suckered	Al	into	making	that	statement	on election	day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,	he	did	not,	Ambrose.	I	wasn’t	going	to	go	out	there	and	say	something	I didn’t	believe	in.	I	just	never	anticipated	the	reaction	would	be	so	strong.	It’s actually	quite	interesting—it’s	the	widest	margin	we’ve	had	in	an	election	in	our district	in	almost	fifty	years.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	there	is	a	dubious	distinction,”	Ambrose	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	It	just	means	I	didn’t	understand	the	depth	of	anger	back	home.	Do	you know,	two	weeks	ago	I	would	have	said	there	was	no	chance	in	the	world	that referendum	would	pass,	that	the	citizens	of	our	state	would	go	it	alone—possibly in	the	face	of	a	war—rather	than	work	it	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	shrugged.	“Come	on,	boss.	Who	is	there	to	work	with	any	more?	All	it takes	to	land	yourself	in	jail	these	days	is	to	discuss	this	stuff	in	a	chatroom somewhere.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	right.	I	just	didn’t	see	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	what	do	you	think	you’re	going	to	do?”	Valerie	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pick	up	the	pieces,”	he	said.	“There’s	a	hundred	law	firms	in	Washington	I could	go	to	work	for,	or	maybe	I	can	wangle	an	ambassadorship	out	of	the	next President.	I	think	my	chances	with	this	one	are	shot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shook	her	head,	her	eyes	watering.	“Al,	I	thought	you	were	going	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p337"></a>President	some	day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	grimaced.	“I	did	too,	Val.	I	did	too.”	then	his	eyes	narrowed	as	he	looked	at her.	“Val,	how	are	you	holding	up?	You’ve	had	an	impossible	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shrugged,	her	body	stiff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	be	okay,”	she	said,	and	her	voice	broke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ambrose	spoke.	“You	don’t	have	to	keep	the	whole	world	running,	Valerie.	It’s okay	to	grieve	for	your	brother.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	just	that,	Ambrose.	It’s	my	father.	Oh,	my	God,	you	should	have	seen him.	He’s	like	a	walking	skeleton—he’s	lost	his	wife	and	his	son	and	his	job	in the	last	three	years.	It’s	like	the	whole	world	is	crumbling	around	him.	Al,	I’m afraid	of	what	he	might	do.	Do	you	know,	if	West	Virginia	does	secede	I	think he’s	going	to	get	himself	killed.	And	Kenny—he	was	such	a	beautiful	little	boy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	would	have	lived	if	they	hadn’t	cut	the	funding.	And	I	didn’t	have	time	to	do anything	about	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Valerie,”	Clark	said.	“You	don’t	know	that.	He	might	have	gone	even	if	the funding	hadn’t	been	cut.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	so.	Three	of	the	children	who	were	in	the	program	died	within three	days	after	the	treatment	was	stopped.	There’s	got	to	be	a	reckoning	for	that, but	no	one	is	investigating,	no	one	is	saying	anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dear	God,”	Clark	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Al,	I	just	don’t	know	what	to	do.	My	Dad	is	all	I’ve	got	left,	and	I	think	I’ve already	lost	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	stack	of	reports,	presentations,	paperwork	and	more	paperwork	was	smaller than	it	had	been	on	Murphy’s	arrival	at	the	brigade	headquarters,	but	not	by	a significant	amount.	He’d	had	a	lot	of	paperwork	as	a	battalion	commander,	but	it appeared	the	volume	of	paper	directly	increased	with	rank. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p338"></a>This	much	was	true:	he	had	a	hell	of	a	job	ahead	of	him.	Regardless	of	the outcome	of	the	debate	in	the	State	House,	his	job	was	to	make	this	brigade	ready for	combat.	Right	now,	they	weren’t	even	close.	Personnel	was	the	biggest problem—since	the	referendum	passed,	nearly	five	percent	of	his	officers	had resigned.	More	were	sure	to	come,	especially	when	serious	war	preparations began.	Worse,	nearly	fifteen	percent	of	the	enlisted	personnel	had	not	shown	up when	the	governor	called	them.	They	were	voting	with	their	feet,	probably leaving	West	Virginia	rather	than	be	caught	in	the	middle	of	the	conflict. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	tank	battalions	that	could	not	man	all	their	tanks,	infantry	companies without	a	full	complement	of	riflemen,	and	at	the	command	and	staff	level	the holes	were	worse.	One	armor	battalion	in	the	southern	part	of	the	state	had	seen the	resignation	of	the	entire	battalion	staff,	leaving	the	senior	company commander,	a	captain,	in	command	of	the	entire	battalion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ammunition	was	also	a	problem.	They	had	plenty	of	small	arms	ammo,	but	the initial	estimate	of	tank	cannon	rounds	was	only	enough	for	two	days	of	sustained combat,	and	there	was	no	way	to	get	any	more.	The	Air	National	Guard	was	in worse	shape:	the	A-10	anti-tank	aircraft	company	in	Lewiston	didn’t	have	a single	combat	round	on	hand.	Unless	they	could	put	their	hands	on	some ammunition,	the	planes	would	be	no	use	for	anything	but	observation,	and	that was	pretty	limited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	ran	through	his	thoughts,	Murphy	made	a	list	of	problems	that	needed	to be	addressed,	starting	with	the	ongoing	siege	outside	this	very	building.	That would	have	to	be	dealt	with	immediately—he	would	need	to	talk	to	General Peak	about	options.	Next	on	the	list	came	personnel,	then	ammunition	and	fuel, then	training.	He’d	pull	the	brigade	staff	together	first	thing	in	the	morning	to look	at	resolving	all	of	those	areas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	phone	rang.	Without	looking	up	from	the	papers,	he	lifted	the	receiver	to	his ear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Colonel	Murphy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Colonel,	this	is	Major	Johnson,	on	General	Peak’s	staff	in	Charleston.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	can	I	do	for	you,	Major?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	I’ve	been	asked	to	get	in	touch	with	you	by	Chief	of	Staff	Colonel	Briggs. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p339"></a>General	Peak	suffered	a	severe	stroke	this	morning,	and—sir,	the	prognosis	is not	good.	The	governor	has	ordered	you	and	the	other	Brigade	commanders	to report	to	him	immediately.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	closed	his	eyes.	Things	just	seemed	to	keep	getting	worse. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p340"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	Thirty</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">November	10</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	hours	later	Murphy’s	helicopter	landed	on	the	snow-dusted	helicopter	pad next	to	the	Governor’s	Mansion	in	Charleston.	The	flight	was	cold	and disorienting:	they’d	been	tossed	about	as	they	hit	gusts	of	wind	between	the mountains,	and	a	sheet	of	white	snow	thrown	up	by	the	rotors	blanked	out visibility	as	they	landed.	Hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fifty	feet	away	from	the	chopper,	a	young	lieutenant	wearing	fatigues	and	a pistol	stood	and	saluted	Murphy	as	he	approached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Welcome,	sir.	If	you’ll	come	this	way,	I’ll	take	you	straight	to	the	governor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Interesting, </i>	Murphy	thought.	It	was	a	National	Guard	officer	who	escorted	him to	the	governor,	and	not	a	civilian	aide	of	some	kind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lieutenant	led	him	directly	to	governor’s	office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ken,”	Slagter’s	voice	boomed	as	Murphy	entered	the	office.	“Welcome, welcome.	I	hope	you’re	holding	up	okay	after	the	loss	of	your	son.	I	was	very sorry	to	hear	about	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	in,	come	in,	we’ve	some	things	to	discuss.	You	know	Mark	Brown,	the attorney	general?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,	we’ve	met,”	Murphy	said.	“It’s	a	pleasure	to	see	you,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you,	Colonel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sure	you	know	these	gentlemen.”	Slagter	indicated	four	officers	who	stood around	the	conference	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Colonel	Myers,	the	First	Brigade	Commander,	was	based	out	of	Logan	County. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blonde,	athletic,	he	was	the	youngest	officer	in	the	room	at	thirty-five,	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p341"></a>most	aggressive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Colonel	Hatfield,	commander	of	the	501st	Artillery	Brigade,	white-haired,	had until	recently	been	battalion	commander	for	the	Division	Combat	Service Support	team.	A	former	Logan	County	sheriff	and	Democratic	party	chairman, his	brigade	command	had	less	to	do	with	experience	than	political	connections. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	other	two	men	were	colonels	Wilson	Briggs,	the	Division	Chief	of	Staff,	and Roland	May,	commander	of	the	450th	Air	Cavalry	Brigade,	based	out	of Charleston. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	nodded	to	the	other	officers.	“Hello,	sirs,”	he	said.	Only	recently promoted	to	full	Colonel,	he	was	the	most	junior	officer	in	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	governor	and	the	attorney	general	sat	down	at	the	antique	mahogany conference	table,	and	the	officers	followed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mark,”	Slagter	said,	and	gestured	to	the	attorney	general. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brown	placed	his	hands	flat	on	the	table	and	spoke.	“Gentlemen,	I	will	get straight	to	the	point.	General	Peak’s	stroke	was	quite	serious.	While	he	will	live, he	is	paralyzed,	and	we	don’t	know	if	he	will	recover.	As	you	know,	this	is	a most	serious	time	for	West	Virginia.	We	cannot	leave	open	the	question	of command	of	the	National	Guard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	glanced	at	the	other	officers.	None	of	them	spoke	up,	so	he	asked	the question.	“Governor,	what	about	General	Wilson,	the	assistant	division commander?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brown	answered	instead	of	the	governor.	“I	have	his	resignation	on	my	desk, effective	today.	It	seems	he	is	unwilling	to	stay	in	command	of	the	West	Virginia guard	when	we	may	soon	be	called	to	defend	our	state.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which	leaves	you	gentleman,”	said	Slagter.	“Colonel	Hatfield,	you	are	the	most senior	officer	present,	according	to	your	service	records.	But	I	am	very concerned,	sir,	about	your	lack	of	any	combat	experience	whatsoever.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hatfield	said,	“Governor,	I	assure	you,	I	am	quite	fit	for	command.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	assurances	are	noted,	Colonel.	However,	they	aren’t	enough.	I’ll	need	an</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p342"></a>officer	with	combat	experience.	The	first	question	I	have	is	the	one	I	should	have asked	of	General	Wilson.	Are	any	of	you	willing	to	stay	in	command	in	the	event the	legislature	passes	a	declaration	of	independence?	Will	you	stay	and	fight	for your	state,	if	you	must?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	officers	looked	at	each	other.	Murphy’s	first	thought	was	they	looked paralyzed.	Whatever	they	said	would	be	wrong	at	this	point.	If	they	answered	in the	affirmative,	it	amounted	to	treason	against	the	federal	government.	The	same federal	government	that	killed	his	friends,	cut	off	his	son’s	medical	care	and	shot civilians	in	the	street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	settled	it.	Murphy	spoke	up.	“I’ll	stay	and	fight.	The	federal	government has	abandoned	everything	that	made	us	American.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Colonel	Briggs	spoke,	his	tone	ice.	“Murphy,	that’s	treason	you	are	talking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Colonel,	I	swore	an	oath	to	protect	the	Constitution	of	the	United	States—and the	federal	government	is	trampling	all	over	that	Constitution.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Briggs	frowned.	“I	don’t	know	where	in	that	oath	it	authorizes	armed insurrection.	Governor,	I’ll	have	nothing	to	do	with	any	discussion	of	treason	or secession,	and	I’ll	inform	you	now	that	I	will	report	what	is	said	in	this	meeting to	the	Army.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter	looked	Briggs	in	the	eye.	“I’ll	accept	your	immediate	resignation, Colonel.	You	may	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Colonel	May	pursed	his	lips	and	shook	his	head.	“Me	too,	sir.	I	understand where	you’re	coming	from,	Murphy,	but	you	miss	the	point.	A	lot	of	people	will die	if	we	end	up	fighting	a	war	here.	I’m	taking	my	family	and	leaving	the	state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	is	a	huge	mistake.”	He	stood	up	and	walked	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Myers	and	Murphy	looked	at	each	other.	With	Hatfield	ruled	out	by	the governor,	one	of	the	two	of	them	would	be	in	command. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Colonel	Murphy,”	Slagter	said.	“Refresh	my	memory.	You	were	an	enlisted man	in	the	Gulf	War,	correct?	Infantry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	a	cavalry	scout,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p343"></a>“Then	an	armor	officer.	You	served	in	Yugoslavia	and	in	the	Iraq	War.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you,	Colonel	Myers.	You	were	also	in	Iraq.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,	Colonel	Murphy	and	I	served	together.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter	grunted.	“And	what	would	you	do,	sir,	if	you	were	in	my	shoes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	if	I	can	answer	that	question,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Give	it	a	stab.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	I	would	place	Colonel	Murphy	in	command.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	is	that,	Colonel?	What	not	you?”	Murphy	blurted	out	the	question	before the	governor	could	speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Myers	grimaced.	“Politics	and	morale.	We	can’t	win	a	war	here.	Governor,	after the	past	year,	Colonel	Murphy	is	an	instantly	recognizable	figure	throughout America.	He’s	looked	at	almost	as	a	popular	hero.	It	will	be	an	early	morale blow	to	our	opponents,	and	a	boost	to	our	side,	if	we	have	someone	of	his…</p>
<p class="calibre1">stature…	in	command.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	agree	with	his	assessment,	Colonel	Hatfield?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	appears	I’m	out	of	the	running,	sir.	Yes,	I	suppose	I	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter’s	gaze	turned	to	Murphy,	who	sat	there,	intensely	uncomfortable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	Colonel?	Are	you	in	agreement	with	Colonel	Myers?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	attacked	one	half	of	Myers’s	statement,	ignoring	the	most	critical	part	of the	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,	he	is	correct.	We	cannot	win	a	war	against	the	United	States.	It	will	be necessary	for	you	to	find	a	political	solution.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	asking	about	command.	You	can’t	dodge	the	question	forever,	Colonel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p344"></a>“Sir,	I’m	the	most	junior	colonel	you	have.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brown	spoke	up.	“You	have	more	combat	experience,	however.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	if	you	choose	to	do	this,	I	will	accept.	But	I	caution	you,	we	can	defend	this state	three	days,	maybe	a	week,	against	a	ground	assault,	depending	on	the weather.	No	longer,	and	not	without	sustaining	massive	civilian	casualties.	You must—absolutely	must—find	a	political	solution,	sir.	There	is	no	military solution	to	our	problem.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter	cocked	his	head.	“What	if	we	make	it	clear	to	the	President	that	it	will cost	him	dearly—it	will	cost	the	Army	dearly—to	invade	us?	Look,	there’s	no question	in	my	mind	the	bill	will	make	it	through	the	House	and	Senate.	Anyone who	wishes	to	stay	in	office	will	have	to	vote	for	it.	It’s	almost	certain	they would	override	any	veto.	It’s	just	a	matter	of	time—possibly	a	few	weeks—</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	we’ll	have	a	declaration	of	independence	on	our	hands.	Look	at	what happened	to	Congressman	Clark.	If	I	get	in	the	way	of	this,	they’ll	run	right	over me.	Someone	needs	to	defend	our	borders.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	do	it,	sir.	I’ll	try	to	buy	you	time.	You	have	to	keep	them	from	coming	if you	can.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter	turned	to	Brown.	“Mark,	please	pass	to	the	legislature	my recommendation	that	Colonel	Murphy	be	promoted	to	Brigadier	General.	I	can at	least	give	him	a	brevet	rank,	can’t	I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	good	enough.	Congratulations,	General.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	soon	can	you	get	a	defense	plan	to	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	would	need	to	consult	with	the	division	and	brigade	staff	and	get	an	initial plan	written.	That	would	depend	on	current	force	strength.	He	had	a	lot	of	work to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“End	of	next	week,	sir.	I’ll	need	to	bring	some	people	here—all	the	brigade	and battalion	commanders,	plus	the	staff	for	each	of	the	brigades.	We’ll	need	to	do</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p345"></a>some	large	scale	planning	exercises,	and	quickly.	Colonel	Myers,	I’ll	be	heavily relying	on	your	expertise	in	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Myers	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter	nodded,	too.	“Do	what	you	need	to	do,	General.	The	one	other	thing:	I want	the	feds	out	of	Morgantown.	I	won’t	have	them	surrounding	one	of	our military	installations.	Use	force	if	you	must,	but	try	to	find	a	way	to	get	them	out without	any	shooting.	Now	that	you	are	in	command,	you	get	the	hard	tasks.	Oh, that	reminds	me!	Mark,	do	you	have	them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	to	Brown,	who	pulled	out	a	plastic	sheet	with	stars	pinned	to	it.	Myers and	the	governor	pinned	the	stars	on	Murphy’s	epaulets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Congratulations,	sir.”	Myers	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	may	not	turn	out	to	be	such	a	prize.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Probably	not.	Yours	may	be	the	first	public	hanging,	General,	but	I	won’t	be	far behind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	let’s	get	to	it.	We’ve	got	a	lot	of	work	to	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	phone	rang	again,	and	Valerie	answered	it,	irritated.	She	had	asked	the current	receptionist,	a	new	intern	from	Brown,	to	hold	any	calls.	So	far,	the phone	had	been	ringing	off	the	hook	most	of	the	morning.	The	Attorney	general had	issued	indictments	against	twenty	members	of	the	religious	cult	at Baughman	Settlement,	for	the	bombings	in	Arlington	and	Charleston,	as	well	as the	murder	of	Dale	Whitt.	The	press	was	going	crazy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	Valerie	Murphy,”	she	snarled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Valerie,	can	you	come	in	here	if	you’re	not	too	grumpy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	face	flushed;	it	was	Clark.	“Sorry,	boss.	I’ll	be	right	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	walked	toward	Clark’s	office	and	tripped	over	a	cardboard	packing	box someone	had	left	between	the	desks. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p346"></a>“Oh	for	Christ’s	sake,	can’t	you	put	your	box	inside	your	cube?	Someone	could get	hurt.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately	she	felt	ashamed	of	herself	for	the	outburst.	It	wasn’t	anyone	else’s fault	she	was	so	upset. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	sat	at	his	desk,	his	coat	off,	tie	loose	and	collar	open.	Despite	the	frigid temperature	outside,	Clark	had	his	windows	open	to	let	out	the	heat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	she	walked	in,	Valerie	said,	“Boss,	have	the	engineers	been	up	here	yet?	I	can call	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	worry	about	it.”	He	waved	his	hand	vaguely	toward	the	entrance.	“I asked	the	new	intern,	she	called	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	looked	over	her	shoulder,	and	then	quietly	spoke.	“She	probably	sent them	to	the	wrong	office.	I’m	really	not	impressed	with	this	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	just	getting	older,	Valerie,”	he	said.	“Less	tolerant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	opened	and	Ambrose	strolled	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	Valerie.”	Ambrose	sat	down	in	the	empty	chair	next	to	her	and	absently twirled	the	tip	of	his	mustache.	“What’s	up,	boss?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	leaned	back	in	his	chair	and	looked	at	the	two	of	them.	“I	just	got	a	call from	Frank	Slagter.	He	wants	me	to	resign	early	and	come	back	to	Charleston.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	and	Ambrose	met	each	other’s	eyes.	If	Slagter	was	involved,	nothing good	would	come	of	it.	His	administration	had	been	marked	with	a	series	of scandals	and	corruption	investigations,	and	a	marked	lack	of	serious	leadership. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	couldn’t	be	trusted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ambrose	cautiously	said,	“What	for?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	seems	Kurt	Hamilton	has	stepped	down	as	secretary	of	state.	Slagter	wants me	to	take	the	job.	Specifically,	he	wants	me	to	negotiate	our	way	out	of	a	war, when	the	legislature	passes	the	independence	bill.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	you	get	the	booby	prize,”	Valerie	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p347"></a>“No,	Valerie,	your	father	got	the	booby	prize:	he	has	accepted	command	of	West Virginia’s	National	Guard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	eyes	widened.	“Oh,	dear	God,	you’re	not	serious.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	did,	Valerie.	But	we	won’t	let	it	come	to	a	war,	if	we	can	avoid	it.	Frank seems	to	believe	I’m	the	best	person	to	negotiate	with	the	federal	government	on this.	But	I’ll	need	some	help.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.	What	do	you	want	us	to	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	with	me.	I’ll	need	an	assistant	or	chief	of	staff	or	something.	Do	what you’re	doing	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.	You	got	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark’s	gaze	shifted	to	Ambrose.	“What	about	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ambrose	continued	twisting	his	mustache	thoughtfully,	then	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Boss,	I’m	with	you	all	the	way—but	not	back	there.	When	I	left	West	Virginia	I promised	myself	I’d	never	go	back,	and	I’ve	kind	of	kept	that	promise.	I	don’t live	there	anymore,	anyway.	I’ll	find	a	job	around	here—there’s	plenty	of	jobs for	lawyers	in	Washington.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	cocked	his	head.	“Why	not?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ambrose	cocked	his	head.	“Look	at	me.	I’m	a	gay	black	man.	Marked	on	all counts.	Being	Black	was	bad	enough—cops	always	harassing	me,	couldn’t	get	a job,	only	option	I	had	was	to	get	a	scholarship	and	get	out.	And	I	couldn’t	fall back	on	the	black	community;	back	home,	being	gay	is	worse	than	being	white. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	offense,	but	I’ll	stay	here,	thank	you.	West	Virginia	was	bad	enough,	but	an independent	West	Virginia,	devoid	of	federal	anti-discrimination	protection—oh, no.	I	don’t	think	so.	The	DHS	may	have	some	bad	apples,	but	they	don’t	have anything	on	the	Klan.	And	now	it	turns	out	it	was	more	crazies	from	West Virginia	that	blew	up	the	federal	building?	No,	I	think	I’ll	stay	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	nodded,	and	unbidden,	felt	tears	begin	to	stream	down	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	Val,”	Ambrose	said.	“It’s	not	so	bad.	DC	is	a	great	place	to	live.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p348"></a>“I’m	sorry.	I	just	can’t	seem	to	stop	crying	lately.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ambrose	nodded.	“It	does	seem	like	the	end	of	an	era,	doesn’t	it?	We	made	a good	team.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	we	did,”	Clark	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	phone	rang.	Four	rings.	Five.	Mike	pictured	Alicia	standing	there,	staring	at the	caller	ID	on	the	phone,	waiting	for	him	to	hang	up.	He	sat	in	his	one	chair,	an open	beer	on	the	floor	beside	him.	A	book	lay	open	on	the	floor	beside	the	beer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Otherwise,	the	room	was	still	empty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Six	rings.	Seven.	Eight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alicia?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	Mike.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	an	excruciating	moment,	they	were	silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	are	you	calling,	Mike?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Today	is	Savannah’s	birthday,	Alicia.	I	am	calling	to	wish	her	a	happy birthday.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	fine,	Mike.	We	gave	her	your	present,	if	that’s	what	you’re	worried about.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“May	I	speak	to	her,	please?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mike	heard	her	inhale	quickly.	“No,	Mike.	I	don’t	think	that’s	a	good	idea.	It	will just	upset	her	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alicia…	I	am	her	father.	You	can’t	do	this	to	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	will	do	what	I	think	is	best	for	her.	If	you	talk	to	her	it	will	just	get	her	upset again.	She	doesn’t	need	that	right	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p349"></a>Mike	could	feel	the	blood	rushing	to	his	head.	His	heart	was	pounding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alicia…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mike,	let	me	ask	you	something.	You	haven’t	once	asked	when	I	was	coming home.	Why	not?	Don’t	you	care?	Is	it	because	of	her?	That	bitch	you	dated	in college?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?	What	are	you	talking	about?	She’s	got	nothing	to	do	with	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	give	me	a	break,	Mike.	Everybody	on	earth	knows	you	carried	on	with	her when	you	were	in	Charleston.	I	just	wish	you	had	had	the	balls	to	tell	me,	instead of	me	finding	out	from	a	magazine.	You	disgust	me,	Mike.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	have	a	clue	what	you	are	talking	about,	Alicia,	and	you	weren’t	here when	I	got	home	from	Charleston	anyway.	Just	in	case	you	forgot,  <i class="calibre3">you</i>	left	 <i class="calibre3">me</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	house	was	empty	when	I	came	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	response	was	a	whisper.	“Our	house	has	been	empty	for	years.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	background,	Mike	heard	a	voice	that	made	his	heartbeat	race	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mommy,	mommy.	I	heard	you	yelling.	Is	that	Daddy	on	the	phone?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	honey,	you	go	on	to	bed,”	Alicia	responded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mike	shouted	without	thinking,	“Savannah,	it’s	me,	Daddy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mommy!	I	want	to	talk	to	Daddy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	I	said	no,	now	go	to	bed!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Savannah	shrieked,	and	Mike	cringed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alicia,	let	her	talk	on	the	phone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	hear	what	you	started,	you	bastard?”	Alicia	shouted	into	the	phone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mike	heard	a	crash,	then	the	phone	disconnected.	She	must	have	slammed	the phone	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mike	stared	at	the	phone	in	his	hand,	breathing	heavily,	his	face	red. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p350"></a>*</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	Morgantown,	Karen	Greenfield	sat	at	her	desk	and	looked	at	the	cover	of	the magazine.	The	cover	featured	a	ten-year-old	photograph	of	her	and	Mike	Morris in	formal	clothing,	holding	each	other	in	an	embrace.	Superimposed	at	the bottom	corners	were	more	recent	and	less	flattering	photographs	of	both	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Revolution?”	read	the	cover	in	large	bold	letters.	Below,	the	subtitle:	“How	two military	officers	ignited	the	West	Virginian	independence	movement.	What really	happened	that	week	in	Charleston?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had	come	back	to	the	office	after	dinner	and	found	the	magazine	on	her chair.	One	of	the	helicopter	pilots	must	have	dropped	it	there—they	were	the only	people	who’d	been	able	to	leave	the	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Dear	God, </i>	she	thought.	Where	the	hell	did	they	get	that	photograph?	She	hadn’t seen	it	since	she	and	Mike	broke	up.	It	had	been	her	favorite:	Mike	in	his	ROTC</p>
<p class="calibre1">uniform,	her	in	a	black	dress,	her	hair	tied	up,	her	head	thrown	back	laughing.	It was	taken	at	a	formal	Christmas	party	at	BowlingGreen	their	sophomore	year, the	night	Mike	proposed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	inside	article	was	worse.	First	a	chronicle	of	events	in	Charleston:	the shootout	with	the	DHS,	complete	with	diagrams	and	screen	captures	from	the home	video. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	article	read,	“Karen	Greenfield	is	described	by	her	fellow	officers	as	the	‘ice queen,’	refusing	to	participate	in	social	activities	within	the	unit.	Her	former	co-workers	at	Saturn	Microsystems	describe	her	as	‘cool	and	efficient,’	and	many express	shock	and	admiration	at	her	actions	in	Charleston.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Ice	queen,	hell, </i>	she	thought.  <i class="calibre3">Just	because	I	turned	those	assholes	down	for	dates. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">It	got	worse.	A	photograph	of	Mike	and	Alicia	at	their	wedding,	raising	a	toast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled	in	the	photograph.	He	did	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	married	in	a	tuxedo,	not	in	uniform.	It	seemed	odd:	the	wedding	took place	after	he’d	been	commissioned	as	a	Second	Lieutenant,	and	the	Mike Morris	she	remembered	would	have	insisted	on	wearing	his	uniform.	On	second thought,	looking	at	the	photograph	of	the	dour	father-in-law,	Congressman Skaggs,	maybe	this	made	more	sense. </p>

<p class="calibre1">on	when	and	where	Mike	and	Karen	met	again	in	Charleston.	Some	weasel	in the	battalion	staff	had	given	the	reporters	the	dates	and	times	they’d	met. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some	members	of	the	administration	are	asking	whether	or	not	the	relationship between	these	officers	had	a	significant	impact	on	events	in	West	Virginia. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Congressman	Skagg’s	office	has	refused	to	comment	on	the	question,	but	Skaggs has	called	for	a	full	investigation	into	Morris’s	activities	in	West	Virginia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Son	of	a	bitch	wasn’t	standing	behind	his	son-in-law.  <i class="calibre3">What	an	ass, </i>	Karen thought.	She	remembered	the	early	days	when	she’d	fallen	in	love	with	Mike Morris.	It	was	all	wrapped	in	her	mind	with	the	joy	of	that	first	freedom	in	her life—finally	away	from	the	nightmare	of	foster	homes	and	devastated	coal towns,	finally	on	her	own,	and	passionately	in	love,	not	just	with	Mike,	but	with life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	sidebar	included	a	profile	of	Sasha	Zana,	a	Kurdish-American	who’d	been arrested	immediately	after	the	bombing	in	Charleston.	The	19-year-old	college student	had	purple	spiked	hair	and	a	diamond	stud	on	her	nose.	She	was	suing the	federal	government	after	being	held	for	two	months	without	charge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	taking	her	eyes	off	the	article,	she	picked	up	the	phone	and	dialed information.	“Fort	Meade,	Maryland,”	she	said.	“Captain	Michael	Morris.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	wrote	down	the	number,	then	dialed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	rings,	and	he	answered,	his	voice	sounding	anxious.	“Captain	Morris speaking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi,	Mike.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	pause.	“Karen?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	Have	you	seen	the	article?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	just	got	home	from	the	PX.	It	was	all	over	the	place—the	clerk	smirked	at</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p352"></a>me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	snorted.	“It’s	like	being	a	target,	isn’t	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	well,	I’ll	just	have	to	keep	moving.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled,	then	gently	said,	“I…	I’m	sorry	to	hear	about	Alicia.	You	must really	miss	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I	miss	Savannah,	terribly.	Today’s	her	birthday,	you	know.	Alicia	woudn’t let	me	talk	to	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	the	hell	did	you	tell	her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing.	They	were	already	gone	when	I	got	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	felt	relief	flood	through	her.	They	hadn’t	left	because	of	her	after	all.	“I see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	silent,	and	she	could	hear	him	breathing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mike	broke	the	silence.	“How	are	you	holding	up?	I	see	you	on	the	news	every day,	or	at	least	the	outside	of	the	building	you’re	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know.	I’ve	never	imagined	what	it	would	be	like	to	have	the	attorney general	insist	on	the	death	penalty	for	me.	I	always	wanted	to	serve	my	country, you	know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm.	This	is	horrible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	going	to	do?	I	mean,	it	sounds	like	this	thing	will	come	to	blows.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	a	tank	commander,	Mike.	I’ll	do	what	I	have	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	serious?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	couldn’t	be	more	serious.	The	federal	government	doesn’t	stand	for	anything</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p353"></a>anymore.	Certainly	not	for	freedom.	You	remember	when	we	were	growing	up, and	Saddam	Hussein	in	Iraq	was	the	big	bogeyman?	Or	Russia	for	our	parents? </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	live	in	Iraq,	Mike.	We	live	in	Russia.	Pretty	soon	you’ll	have	to	get	a passport	to	drive	to	the	local	WalMart.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mike	exhaled.	“I	refuse	to	believe	that.	I’d	give	my	life	for	my	country.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	not	talk	about	it,	then.	Because	for	all	we	know,	one	of	us	may	have	to	do that	soon.	I	don’t	think	I	could	bear	it,”	she	said,	her	voice	breaking	slightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	true—in	a	matter	of	days	or	weeks,	she	would	be	out	in	the	field,	possibly in	combat	against	the	United	States. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Karen…	I	meant	what	I	said	in	Charleston.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tears	ran	down	her	face.	She	took	a	deep	breath,	wiped	her	eyes,	and	then responded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I	didn’t.	I	don’t	want	you	to	go	away.	If	we	live	through	this,	Mike…	I want	you	to	come	find	me.	Do	you	hear?	I	must	be	a	complete	idiot,	because	I still	love	you,	you	bastard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	he	could	reply,	she	gently	set	the	phone	on	the	cradle,	then	laid	her	head in	her	hands	and	wept. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Valerie	walked	beside	Congressman	Clark	past	the	security	gates	and	into	the main	terminal,	then	winced	as	a	mob	of	reporters	rushed	at	them,	bright	lights on,	microphones	waving	in	the	air	like	giant	reeds.	Other	passengers	leaving	the terminal	shied	away,	as	if	afraid	of	being	caught	in	the	limelight	and	associated with	a	subversive	event.	One	man	literally	jumped	when	he	noticed	a	camera pointed	near	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	moved	close	to	Clark	as	the	reporters	crowded	in	around	them, microphones	shoved	in	their	faces.	One	of	the	journalists	pushed	so	close	she could	smell	his	sour	aftershave.	She	wanted	to	shove	him	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Congressman,	is	it	true	you	are	going	to	accept	the	position	of	secretary	of state?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Congressman,	are	you	still	against	West	Virginia	independence?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Congressman,	what	are	your	plans?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	held	his	hands	up,	palm	out,	and	said,	“One	question	at	a	time,	please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Congressman,	Sarah	Davis	with	Channel	Four.	Is	it	true	you	are	accepting	the position	as	secretary	of	state?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shook	his	head	sharply	in	the	negative.	“Governor	Slagter	and	I	are	talking, nothing	specific	has	been	decided.	Think	of	it	as	a	job	interview.	You	know	I’ve been	fired,	so	I’ll	be	looking	soon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	reporters	chuckled.	Valerie	thought	the	joke	in	bad	taste	and	nearly	elbowed Clark	in	the	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Congressman,	Randall	Pitts	from	the	Logan	Examiner.	During	the	election	you came	out	with	a	strong	statement	against	independence	for	West	Virginia.	Now the	referendum	has	passed,	are	you	opposed	to	the	declaration	currently	being debated	in	the	State	House?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p355"></a>Clark	took	a	deep	breath	and	spoke.	“I	believe	this	move	will	lead	us	to	war against	the	United	States.	I’m	committed	to	do	what	I	can	do	prevent	any violence.	However,	it	is	clear—very	clear—how	the	people	of	West	Virginia feel.	I	believe	a	declaration	if	independence	is	now	inevitable.	For	that	reason, and	to	prevent	more	bloodshed,	I’ll	do	everything	in	my	power	to	help	negotiate a	peaceful	settlement.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	think	it	will	come	to	war,	sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	do	my	best	to	see	it	doesn’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Congressman,	what	about	the	indictments	in	the	terrorist	attacks?	Do	you	have any	comment?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	nodded.	“This	is	a	perfect	example	of	the	system	working.	The	way	our country	is	supposed	to	work	is	through	the	law.	In	the	case	of	Baughman Settlement,	those	folks	have	been	arrested	and	they’ll	get	a	trial.	Let’s	hope	we can	go	through	the	law	and	diplomacy	to	settle	these	others	questions.	We	don’t need	any	more	violence.	No	more	questions,	I	have	work	to	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately,	there	was	one	more	question.	For	the	first	time,	a	reporter	leveled a	question	at	Valerie	instead	of	Clark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ms.	Murphy,	how	does	it	feel	to	know	your	father	has	accepted	command	of	the defense	of	West	Virginia	in	the	event	of	a	war?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anger	flooded	her.	“How	do	you	think	it	feels?	It’s	frightening.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	two	of	them	walked	away,	the	group	of	reporters	on	their	trail.	A	moment later	they	were	whisked	away	in	a	government	staff	car	to	meet	the	governor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	okay?”	Clark	asked	her	once	they	were	in	the	quiet	of	the	warm	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	be	all	right.	It’s	the	first	time	they’ve	ever	noticed	me	before,	much	less called	me	by	name	and	asked	me	personal	questions.	Assholes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	chuckled.	“You’ll	get	used	to	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	better	not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p356"></a>*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	called	his	officers	together	in	the	gymnasium	of	a	school	that	had	been shut	down	by	the	Kanahwa	County	Public	School	District	five	years	before.	The building	was	now	largely	used	as	a	warehouse,	and	had	been	loaned	to	the	state government	for	purposes	of	this	meeting—and	possibly	for	use	as	a	semi-permanent	headquarters.	They	were	within	five	blocks	of	the	capitol	building, which	made	this	a	good	location	for	a	military	headquarters.	It	also	seemed unlikely	the	federal	government	would	suspect	a	former	school	of	housing military	headquarters,	another	good	reason	to	use	this	location. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	the	gym	was	filled	with	the	officers	and	staff	of	Murphy’s	lopsided division.	Two	infantry	brigades,	heavy	on	armor.	One	aviation	brigade,	with	a battalion	of	Apache	helicopters	and	another	of	A-10	Warthogs.	One	Special Operations	group,	which	luckily	had	some	recent	combat	experience	in	South America.	Not	a	large	force,	and	certainly	not	large	enough	to	effectively	defend the	state.	They	had	virtually	no	ammunition.	The	officer	corps	was	rapidly thinning	out	with	resignations.	They	had	very	little	fuel.	If	it	did	come	to	war,	it would	be	a	short	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	shouted	“Attention!”	as	Murphy	marched	into	the	room,	and	the hundred	or	so	officers	jumped	to	their	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	you	were,”	he	called	out,	and	they	relaxed.	He	took	the	steps	two	at	a	time, his	combat	boots	echoing	on	the	empty	stage,	and	then	stood	in	front	of	the group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	surveyed	the	room,	and	wondered	what	Kenny	would	have	made	of	all	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	thought	settled	like	a	lead	ball	in	his	gut.	Kenny	hated	the	weekends	his father	went	away	for	training,	and	would	have	hated	this	even	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kenny	was	alone	at	the	end.	Pushed	off	on	his	grandmother	during	the	last	two weeks	of	his	life.	Was	any	of	this	worth	the	pain	of	losing	his	son?	Not	in	a million	years.	But	if	his	boy	had	sacrificed	those	last	few	days	with	his	father, willing	or	not,	for	this	cause,	Murphy	would	do	the	rest.	He	 <i class="calibre3">would</i>	do	the	rest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gentlemen.	Ladies.	I’ll	open	with	the	most	important	question	of	the	day,	and one	that	will	determine	whether	or	not	you	should	stay	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	are	all	aware	of	what	the	legislature	is	debating	right	now.	You	are	all</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p357"></a>aware	it	will	almost	certainly	pass	and	be	signed	by	the	governor.	Your	presence here	right	now	could	be	construed	by	some	as	illegal—indeed,	as	treason	against the	United	States.	For	that	reason,	I’m	putting	it	to	you:	you	may	leave,	right now,	and	walk	away.	A	personnel	officer	is	out	in	the	hall	who	will	quickly	and easily	process	your	resignation	from	the	West	Virginia	National	Guard	and prevent	your	possible	trial,	incarceration	or	execution.	Does	everyone understand	the	seriousness	of	this?	If	you	choose	to	stay,	one	of	several	things may	happen.	You	may	die	on	a	battlefield	not	far	from	here.	You	may	lose	any veterans	benefits	for	your	family.	You	may	go	to	prison,	or	worse.	You	may	even be	executed	as	a	traitor.	Even	if	the	bill	doesn’t	pass,	and	we	are	never	called upon	to	act	to	defend	this	state,	if	you	stay	here	it	will	make	you	an	active member	of	a	conspiracy	against	the	United	States	government.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Think	about	it.	You	have	five	minutes	to	make	your	decision,	and	then	we	will move	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	at	his	watch,	and	then	walked	off	the	stage	and	out	the	door.	A moment	later	he	heard	a	familiar	voice	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I’ll	be	damned	if	that	man	doesn’t	have	stars	on	his	collar.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	turned	around,	a	smile	on	his	face.	“Vince,	how	are	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Major	Vince	Elkins	smiled,	his	face	crinkled	into	deep	lines.	“It’s	been	a	pretty tough	time	for	all	of	us,	Ken.	How	are	you	hanging	in?	I	was	so	sorry	to	hear about	Kenny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	shrugged.	“I’m	trying	not	to…	I’m	trying	not	to	dwell	on	it	very	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	now,	when	so	much	is	happening.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elkins	shook	his	head.	“Ken,	you’ve	got	a	right	to	grieve	for	your	son.	He	was	a dear	little	boy.	What	an	incredible	loss.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	right,	maybe,	but	I	can’t	right	now.	I’ve	got	a	war	to	plan	for.	I’ll	have	plenty of	time	for	grief	later.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you	need	someone	to	talk	to—or	to	have	a	beer	with—you	let	me	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	nodded.	“I	will.	How	are	things	back	home?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p358"></a>“Worse	than	ever.	Bunch	of	businesses	have	shut	down,	but	then,	that’s happening	everywhere,	isn’t	it?	People	are	scared	and	out	of	work.	Ken,	we	held a	recruiting	day	in	Harpers	Ferry	about	a	week	ago	and	I	had	a	hundred	men standing	in	line.	I’ve	never	seen	anything	like	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hope	it	will	be	enough.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me	too.	Most	folks	don’t	realize	it—in	fact	I’m	sure	the	damn	politicians	don’t realize	it—but	when	the	Army	comes,	they	won’t	be	pussyfooting	around.	I’ve been	on	the	dishing	out	end	of	the	U.S.	Army	three	times	now,	and	I	don’t	ever want	to	find	out	what	it’s	like	on	the	other	side.	But	now…	Looks	like	we	just might.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	looked	at	his	friend.	“You	don’t	have	to	do	this,	Vince.	You’re	a	doctor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	could	walk	away	right	now,	just	like	I	said	in	that	room.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elkins	frowned,	and	then	grunted	contemptuously.	“Just	goes	to	show	you	they don’t	hand	out	brains	with	your	general’s	stars.	Is	that	how	little	you	think	of me?	I	can’t	walk	away.	Dave	Firkus	was	my	patient	since	he	was	a	baby.	No	way am	I	walking	away	from	this.	Could	you?	After	what	you	lost?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	placed	hand	on	his	friend’s	shoulder,	took	a	deep	breath.	“Thank	you, Vince.	For	understanding.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	General,	I’m	going	to	head	back	in	there	and	see	how	many	of	our officers	turned	into	weasels	overnight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	stepped	back	to	the	door	and	Murphy	caught	his	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	room	was	still	full.	It	looked	as	if	not	a	single	officer	had	left,	or	very	few. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Don’t	they	know	they	could	be	killed? </i>	He	raised	his	hand	to	his	eyes	to	wipe away	unbidden	tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	then.	Somebody	close	the	doors.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	waited	while	two	captains	ran	to	the	doors	and	closed	them.	The	sound echoed	through	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	out	at	the	room.	“Men,	ladies…	I	never	would	have	guessed	it.	I’m proud	of	each	and	every	one	of	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p359"></a>He	took	a	deep	breath,	and	looked	back	at	the	room	full	of	officers,	knowing many	of	them	might	not	live	to	see	another	year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right.	Here’s	the	deal.	We	have	to	assume	the	worst	right	now.	Some	time	in the	next	few	weeks,	the	State	House	will	likely	issue	a	declaration	of independence.	What	does	that	mean	to	us?	We	need	to	scramble—today—to	be ready.	My	expectation	is	within	seventy-two	hours	of	that	declaration,	an	army will	roll	into	West	Virginia.	Make	no	mistake,	folks:	we	can’t	win	that	war.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	officers	stirred	at	this	statement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	believe	me?	How	many	of	you	have	some	combat	experience?”	Murphy asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Less	than	a	quarter	of	the	officers	raised	their	hands,	most	of	them	members	of the	Special	Operations	Group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	many	of	you	have	large	scale	mechanized	combat	experience?	Tank battles?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	time	virtually	no	one	raised	a	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	grimaced.	“It’s	about	what	I	expected.	We	have	to	plan	on	them	hitting	us with	virtually	everything	the	Army	has	on	the	ground	and	in	North	America:	the Third	Infantry,	Seventh	Cavalry,	Hundred-and-first	Airborne,	Eighty-second Airborne,	Tenth	Mountain	Division.	All	of	them	are	within	a	couple	of	days striking	distance—they’d	merely	need	to	fuel	up	their	tanks	and	hit	the	road.	On top	of	that,	if	the	President	follows	recent	doctrine,	they’ll	bomb	the	crap	out	of us	first.	Take	out	all	the	electric	grids,	communications,	bridges,	dams,	roads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only	then	will	ground	forces	come	in—when	we’ve	pretty	much	lost	our	ability to	fight.	Does	everyone	get	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	paused	and	looked	at	the	faces.	Many	of	them	young	and	scared.	Good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,	what	does	this	mean?	Two	things:	first,	I’ve	made	it	absolutely	clear	to the	governor	that	there	is	no	military	solution	to	this	problem.	The	governor must	find	a	political	solution.	Our	job,	in	the	meantime,	is	to	be	a	deterrent.	We may	not	be	able	to	stop	the	United	States	Army	from	pounding	the	crap	out	of us,	but	we	can	make	it	very,	very	painful	to	do	so.	And	that,	folks,	is	our	only hope.	We	have	to	sustain	our	defense	long	enough	that	the	politicians	can	bring</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p360"></a>about	a	settlement.	We’ll	not	just	be	fighting	for	our	lives—we’ll	be	fighting	for our	freedom.” </p>

You’ll	watch	your	men	bleed	and	die.	But	they can’t	outsmart	you.	They	can’t	out-dedicate	you.	You	men	and	women	will	be the	hope	for	freedom	for	our	children.

<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	sat	down	in	the	impromptu	courtroom,	hopefully	for	the	last	time.	Ben Wharton	took	his	seat	next	to	him	and	set	his	soaked	cap	on	the	table	between them.	The	others	were	soon	seated,	with	the	exception	of	Colonel	Sheeman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I	think	this	will	be	it,”	Wharton	whispered.	“You’re	sure	you	want	to make	a	statement?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	nodded.	“I	am.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	not	going	to	do	anything	stupid,	are	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Trust	me,	Ben.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	I	don’t	trust	you,	Mike.	That’s	why	I’m	asking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	burst	open	and	Colonel	Frank	Sheeman	strode	into	the	room.	Like everyone	else	in	the	room	he	wore	his	camouflage	uniform,	soaked	from	the heavy	rain.	He	shook	the	water	off	his	cap,	set	his	briefcase	on	the	table,	and opened	it	with	a	loud	click.	After	removing	his	notebooks	he	sat	down	and surveyed	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,	everyone	is	here.	Let’s	get	this	show	on	the	road.	First	thing:	as	of	today, I’ve	talked	to	all	the	witnesses	I	had	intended	to	call.	Each	of	you	has	a	binder, which	contains	all	the	documentary	evidence	I	will	review	as	part	of	my decision.	Also,	a	reminder	that	my	recommendation	is	not	final,	and	may	well	be overturned	by	the	court-martial	convening	authority.	Does	everyone understand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p361"></a>Sheeman	watched	for	nods	around	the	room.	Everyone	responded	in	the affirmative. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,	good.	Earlier	in	the	investigation,	I	advised	each	of	you	of	your	right	to make	a	statement	or	to	remain	silent.	Do	I	need	to	explain	these	rights	to	you again?	Private	Turville?	Captain	Morris?	Good.	Do	you	wish	to	make	a statement?	Private	Turville?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Harris,	Turville’s	lawyer,	spoke.	“Sir,	Private	Turville	prefers	to	remain silent	at	this	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you.	Captain	Morris.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	an	undertone,	Wharton	said,	“Are	you	sure?	This	could	make	it	worse	for you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sure,”	Morris	responded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Colonel,	my	client	would	like	to	make	a	statement	for	the	record.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	proceed,	Captain.	Come	around	to	the	witness	chair.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	stood,	uncomfortable,	and	relocated	to	the	seat.	The	change	disoriented him;	he	sat	now	facing	Colonel	Sheeman,	with	the	prosecutors	on	his	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sheeman	spoke,	almost	gently.	“For	the	record,	Captain,	please	state	your	full name,	grade	and	organization.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	I	am	Michael	Allen	Morris,	Captain,	and	I	am	company	commander	of Alpha	Company,	First	Battalion,	Fifteenth	Infantry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	may	proceed	with	your	statement,	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	I’ll	be	brief.	Over	the	last	several	days	I’ve	given	this	issue	a	tremendous amount	of	thought.	This	was	a	horrible	tragedy.	Here	we	are,	the	very	forces	who are	sworn	to	protect	and	defend	our	people,	and	in	this	case,	we	took	the	life	of	a young	man	who	was	filming	in	his	own	hometown.	I	think	we’ve	established	a few	facts	here,	sir.	We’ve	established	my	company	was	given	the	order	to	enter an	American	city,	to	escort	the	local	police	force	on	a	law	enforcement	mission. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Second,	I	think	we’ve	established	the	fact	I—and	my	non-commissioned	officers</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p362"></a>—gave	explicit	orders	to	my	men	not	to	lock	and	load	their	weapons.	Finally,	I think	we’ve	established	Private	Turville	disobeyed	that	order.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	glanced	over	at	Turville,	who	visibly	shook,	his	jaw	set.	Morris	looked back	at	Colonel	Sheeman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	got	to	say	one	thing	about	that.	My	instructors	once	taught	me	that	it	is unethical	and	bad	leadership	to	give	an	order	that	is	impossible	to	be	followed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	I	believe,	in	this	case,	this	order	was	impossible	to	be	followed.	Private Turville	was	placed	in	a	situation	where	his	life	might	well	be	in	jeopardy.	At	the time	he	fired	his	weapon,	he	believed	he	and	the	members	of	his	squad	were being	attacked	by	an	armed	individual.	It	was	a	mistake,	but	not	his.	Mine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	his	right,	Wharton	sank	his	head	into	his	hands.	Morris	heard	rustling	in	the back	of	the	room	as	the	reporters	stirred	at	his	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	fact	is	Private	Turville	raised	the	same	question	I	did.	The	order	for American	forces	to	conduct	a	law-enforcement	activity	within	the	boundaries	of the	United	States	was	clearly	an	illegal	order.	The	law	forbids	the	U.S.	Army from	participating	in	such	activities,	for	the	very	reason	that	we	face	a	potential civil	war	right	now.	Yet	I	accepted	that	order	and	went	forward,	even	though	I explicitly	informed	my	commander	of	my	opinion	that	the	order	was	illegal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	paused	and	stretched	his	neck.	He	was	effectively	tanking	his	career	at	this point,	but	he	wasn’t	going	to	force	a	nineteen-year-old	kid	down	with	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	a	commissioned	officer	of	the	United	States,	I	know	an	illegal	order,	and	I know	what	my	duty	is	when	I	receive	an	illegal	order.	I	did	not	do	that	duty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Private	Turville,	on	the	other	hand,	was	in	an	infinitely	more	difficult	position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	is	not	a	commissioned	officer,	and	has	neither	the	training	nor	the	experience to	recognize	the	difference.	Yet	he	too	was	given	an	illegal	order,	and	an impossibly	stupid	one.	If	anyone	should	be	punished	for	that,	it	should	be	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	is	all	I	have	to	say,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sheeman	sat	back,	his	eyebrows	raised,	his	mustache	practically	twitching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	and	his	lawyer	were	in	a	huddle.	Morris	diverted	his	eyes	from	them.	He didn’t	feel	the	sense	of	relief	he’d	expected.	If	he	read	Sheeman	correctly,	he would	approve	of	Morris’	statement,	professional	suicide	though	it	was.	It	was the	right	thing	to	do.	All	the	same,	a	nagging	voice	doubted	his	motives.	His</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p363"></a>move	had	been	self-serving.	Barksdale	was	right.	He	didn’t	care	about	Turville and	what	happened	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	Captain.	You	may	return	to	your	seat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stiffly,	Morris	did	so.	Wharton	put	his	hand	on	his	shoulder	and	whispered,	“You said	you	wouldn’t	do	anything	stupid.	‘Trust	me,’	you	said.	Damn	it,	I	don’t know	whether	to	hug	you	or	hit	you	over	the	head!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sheeman	cleared	his	throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gentlemen,	this	concludes	this	investigation.	I	was	almost	prepared	to	render	a recommendation	today,	but	I	see	I	need	to	go	back	and	review	the	testimony	in greater	detail.	You	can	expect	a	recommendation	in	one	week.	You	may	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sheeman	slammed	his	briefcase	shut,	put	his	still	dripping	cap	on	his	head,	and walked	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	reporters	mobbed	around	Morris,	shouting	questions.	Wharton	waved them	off	and	pulled	Mike	toward	to	the	door.	They	could	talk	to	the	press another	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Back	at	his	house,	in	the	midst	of	a	pile	of	bills,	he	found	a	letter	from	Karen. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Dear	Mike, </i></p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">November	21</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	feds	started	playing	AC/DC	at	about	a	quarter	to	four	in	the	morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lieutenant	Austin	Robear	didn’t	mind	so	much;	he	liked	AC/DC,	though	they were	old-fashioned.	For	the	last	two	days	the	music	played	by	the	DHS	had	been on	a	serious	oldies	acid	rock	trip.	Only	problem	was	they	were	playing	it	at around	110	decibels,	loud	enough	to	cause	the	guard	shack	to	shake,	even	under the	weight	of	the	sandbags.	Austin	would	be	very	happy	to	pull	the	plug	on	that racket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	served	them	right	they	didn’t	hear	the	approach	until	it	was	too	late.	No	one	in the	federal	camp	even	looked	alarmed	until	the	ground	began	to	shake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Austin	stood	ready	in	the	guard	shack	when	he	felt	it.	In	full	combat	gear,	he watched	through	the	window	with	his	night	vision	goggles,	and	reported	back	to Lieutenant	Colonel	Jian	Chang,	the	new	brigade	commander. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	in	the	camp	finally	noticed	the	vibrations	in	the	ground.	One	of	the feds	ran	out	of	his	tent	and	looked	out,	with	what	looked	to	be	night	vision equipment	similar	to	Robear’s.	Then	he	sprinted	to	the	FBI	command	center, another	tent	across	the	street.	Austin	smiled.	After	days	of	harassment,	it	was nice	to	see	them	in	a	flurry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	keyed	his	radio.	“Base,	this	is	Red	Six.	Starting	to	get	some	activity.”	He swallowed	as	he	scanned	the	scene	with	his	night	vision	goggles.	The	feds	were starting	to	panic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	tensed	further	as	he	watched	them.	Back	home	in	Blair,	his	twenty-one	year old	wife	Melissa	was	probably	still	asleep	with	their	son.	He	wanted	to	get	home to	see	them.	Time	to	be	extra	careful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	rock	music	suddenly	cut	off,	and	Robear	heard	ringing	in	his	ears,	then	the distinctive	whine	of	turbine	engines	and	the	loud	crack	of	tank	tracks	slapping into	the	pavement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	they	were:	four	tanks	racing	up	the	street	toward	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p366"></a>He	keyed	the	radio	again.	“Red	elements,	this	is	Red	Six.	Prepare	to	launch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	tanks	were	setting	off	a	panic	in	the	camp.	The	feds	were	racing	out	of	their tents	in	various	states	of	undress,	throwing	on	their	combat	gear.	A	hundred yards	away,	in	the	enclosure	designated	for	the	press,	bright	lights	swung	this way	and	that,	seeking	the	source	of	the	noise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sixty	seconds	later	half	a	dozen	helicopters	flew	over	the	brigade	headquarters, low	to	the	ground,	their	rotors	throwing	up	dust	and	small	rocks.	They	settled	to the	left	of	the	brigade	headquarters,	miniguns	pointed	directly	at	the	federal camp	and	away	from	Robear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	Robear’s	signal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	Red	Six,	go,	go	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	gates	opened	and	two	platoons	of	infantry	sprinted	out	and	dived	to	the ground	in	prone	firing	positions,	their	rifles	aimed	at	the	feds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Robear	walked	calmly	outside	the	gate	and	raised	a	megaphone	to	his	mouth, afraid	his	voice	was	going	to	crack	from	anxiety.	He	needn’t	have	feared:	his command	was	clear	and	crisp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lay	down	your	weapons	and	step	out	into	the	street.	You	will	not	be	harmed	if you	follow	instructions.	Lay	down	your	weapons	where	you	are	and	come	out into	the	street	with	your	hands	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	to	struggle	to	be	heard	over	the	tank	engines	and	the	helicopters,	but	they heard	him.	For	good	measure,	he	repeated	the	instructions	as	loud	as	he	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	one	moved.	The	thirty	or	so	federal	agents—most	of	them	just	aroused	from sleep—stood,	disoriented.	The	press,	however,	was	quite	awake,	and	probably terrified.	Secure	in	their	positions,	they	filmed	everything,	their	bright	lights glaring	in	Austin’s	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Austin	heard	a	voice	on	his	radio—the	brigade	commander	calling	the	tank platoon.	“Blue	Six,	fire	a	warning	shot	into	the	hill	behind	the	feds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	feds	jumped	when	one	of	the	tanks	traversed	its	turret	to	the	right	and	fired	a stream	of	bullets,	which	arced	into	the	hill.	The	reporters	dived	to	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p367"></a>“I	say	again,	lay	down	your	weapons	and	move	into	the	street.	You	are surrounded.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	hopelessly	outgunned	agents	moved	into	the	intersection.	Robear’s	men frisked	them,	and	then	tied	their	arms	with	plastic	loops.	The	National Guardsmen	ignored	the	press	as	they	went	about	their	business.	The	reporters fanned	out,	filming	as	the	Guardsmen	loaded	the	agents	onto	helicopters.	All	of the	weapons	were	cleared	and	stacked	next	to	the	gate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lietenant	Colonel	Chang	appeared	at	Robear’s	side.	“Good	job,	Lieutenant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	sir.	Nice	to	see	we	did	this	without	anyone	getting	hurt.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	agree,	son.	Any	mission	without	anyone	hurt	is	a	success.	Go	ahead	and	get those	men	loaded	on	the	choppers,	and	we’ll	get	them	out	of	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	the	time	the	sun	rose,	the	federal	agents	were	onboard	the	helicopters.	Robear watched,	hands	on	his	hips,	as	the	helicopters	rose	again.	The	plan	was	to	dump the	agents	in	rural	Pennsylvania.	No	need	to	make	things	easy	for	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within	an	hour,	the	news	was	broadcast	across	America:	West	Virginia	had forcefully	evicted	federal	forces	from	within	its	border. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lieutenant	Brady	Antal	and	Major	Vince	Elkins	stood	on	the	edge	of	the	parade ground—now	deeply	rutted	with	tank	tracks—and	watched	the	helicopter approach.	A	hundred	yards	away,	Sergeant	Catlett	stood	over	ten	new	recruits	as they	did	pushups	in	the	muddy	field.	His	shouts	punctuated	the	otherwise	quiet morning,	until	the	sound	of	the	helicopter	overshadowed	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elkins	stood	calmly,	his	expression	fixed.	Antal	felt	apprehensive;	for	nearly	two months	he’d	been	acting	company	commander.	Now,	when	things	were	just about	to	get	hot,	it	didn’t	seem	fair	to	him	that	he	was	pulled	out	and	moved back	to	battalion	headquarters.	Regardless	of	the	circumstance,	he	was	sorry	to lose	his	first	command. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elkins	spoke.	“Lieutenant,	you	look	like	someone	just	stole	your	favorite	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’ve	done	a	good	job	with	the	company	while	Greenfield	was	away.	Any interest	in	having	one	of	your	own?”	Antal	looked	at	Elkins	with	disbelief.	“Of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p368"></a>course,	sir!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	major	frowned.	“Don’t	look	so	happy.	This	is	going	to	be	a	dangerous	and dirty	job,	and	we’re	all	likely	to	be	dead	in	a	few	weeks.	Do	you	get	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	understand,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	then.	Both	Alpha	and	Delta’s	company	commanders	have	resigned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Delta	has	a	strong	XO	who	can	step	in,	but	Alpha	doesn’t.	It’s	yours	if	you	want it.	You’ve	proven	yourself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	sir.	I	won’t	let	you	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	worry	about	letting	me	down.	Worry	about	keeping	your	men	alive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	helicopter,	a	fifty-year-old	Huey,	touched	the	ground.	Karen	Greenfield jumped	out	the	door	and	ran	across	the	field	before	it	even	touched	the	grass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stopped	in	front	of	Elkins	and	saluted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain	Greenfield	reporting	as	ordered,	sir,”	She	couldn’t	suppress	the	smile on	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elkins	returned	the	salute.	“It’s	nice	to	see	you	back,	Karen.	Tell	me	what happened;	all	I’ve	seen	is	what	was	in	the	news.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	chuckled.	“That’s	more	than	I’ve	seen,	sir.	No	one	told	me	about	the operation.	I	was	sitting	having	a	cup	of	coffee,	trying	to	wake	up	when	I	heard tank	tracks	outside,	then	the	helicopters.	Did	you	see	CNN?	They	had	a	much closer	view	than	I	did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	it	looks	like	you	are	going	to	have	a	much	closer	view	of	all	of	this	than most	would	care	to	have.	Let’s	go	talk.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	three	officers	walked	into	the	armory.	Someone	shouted,	“Attention.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	company	burst	into	applause.	Karen	stared,	eyes	wide.	A	banner	stretched</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p369"></a>across	the	room,	with	the	words,	“Welcome	Home,	Captain,”	written	on	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	first	sergeant,	Ken	Shumaker,	approached	with	a	broad	smile	on	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Welcome	back,	ma’am.	I	don’t	approve	of	this	sort	of	thing,	but	they	insisted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well	thank,	you,	First	Sergeant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Antal	stood	to	the	side	as	she	spoke.	“Thank	you,	to	all	of	you.	We	had	a	hell	of a	difficult	situation	to	deal	with	in	Charleston,	and	you	all	handled	it professionally.	We	have	even	more	difficult	times	ahead,	and	I	believe	you	will all	do	your	duty.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Antal	realized	her	eyes	were	watering.	He	tried	to	imagine	how	he	would	feel	in her	position:	isolated,	under	federal	indictment,	relieved	of	her	command,	under siege	at	Brigade	Headquarters	for	almost	two	months.	He	couldn’t.	No	wonder she	had	tears	in	her	eyes:	this	was	a	real	homecoming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elkins	spoke	when	she	finished.	“Let’s	go,	Captain.	Lieutenant	Britton	and Antal,	you	come,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	officers	followed	Elkins	into	the	company	commander’s	office,	now	Karen’s again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	office,	Elkins	set	his	briefcase	down,	opened	it,	and	placed	a	stack	of paper	onto	the	desk.	“This	is	the	battalion	operations	order.	You	need	to	review	it immediately	and	begin	preparing	your	own.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.	I’m	already	familiar	with	the	brigade	plan	in	detail,	so	I’ve	got	a	pretty good	picture	already.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elkins	glanced	at	her,	one	eyebrow	raised.	“Where	did	you	get	the	brigade plan?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wrote	a	good	bit	of	it,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	smiled	and	shook	his	head	slowly.	“I	should	have	realized.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Major	Elkins	unfolded	a	map	on	the	desk.	“Here’s	is	your	company’s	sector. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your	primary	responsibility	will	be	Harpers	Ferry	itself,	and	the	U.S.	340</p>
<p class="calibre1">approach	into	West	Virginia.	As	brief	as	it	was,	your	company	is	the	only	one</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p370"></a>with	any	experience	under	fire,	so	you	get	the	main	approach,	with	Charlie Company	on	your	right	flank,	covering	Route	9.	Alpha	and	Delta	will	take	the outside	flanks	and	serve	as	a	reserve,	here	and	here,	blocking	I-81.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	probably	know	we’re	it.	Brigade	and	division	think	this	whole	section	of the	state	is	a	lost	cause.	We’ll	get	cut	off	by	I-81	and	split	from	the	rest	of	the state.	I	had	to	fight	to	get	this	position—they	didn’t	want	to	put	up	a	defense	here at	all.	Now,	we’ve	got	an	attached	infantry	company,	and	each	of	your companies	will	be	augmented	by	one	platoon	of	infantry.	We	have	a	small amount	of	attached	artillery	and	engineers,	but	not	enough.	We	have	three Special	Forces	A-teams	up	here	training	up	irregular	forces.	I	hope	to	God	those folks	don’t	get	dragged	into	this—mostly	old	men	and	kids	with	shotguns,	but there	are	plenty	of	volunteers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	is	our	personnel	status?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lieutenant	Antal	anwered	this	question,	pride	on	his	face.	They’d	had	fewer resignations	than	any	other	single	company	in	the	state.	“Just	about	the	best	in the	state,	ma’am.	You’ve	only	lost	about	twenty	percent	to	resignations.	We’ve been	cross-training	all	the	experienced	loaders	and	drivers	to	take	over	as gunners	and	tank	commanders.	We’ve	managed	to	backfill	all	of	the	vacant positions	with	new	recruits.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alarmed,	she	said,	“New	recruits?	Did	they	go	through	any	basic	training?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	doing	it	right	here,”	he	replied.	“Sergeant	Catlett	is	running	the	training.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elkins	replied,	“It’s	not	ideal,	Karen,	but	there	is	little	choice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right.”	She	nodded,	face	impassive.	She	was	right	on	target:	the	new recruits	had	only	been	training	three	weeks,	and	had	just	barely	begun	to understand	military	organization.	They	were	out	of	shape	and	weeks	away	from being	in	the	kind	of	physical	condition	they	needed	to	be	in,	and	none	of	them were	ready	to	crew	a	tank.	But	they	could	only	do	what	they	could	do,	and	this was	it.	If	nothing	else,	they	were	dedicated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elkins	spoke.	“I	would	get	out	there	and	survey	your	defensive	positions immediately.	I’d	like	to	see	your	provisional	plan	in	forty-eight	hours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p371"></a>“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Antal	placed	a	sheet	in	front	of	her.	“You’ll	need	to	sign	here,	ma’am.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sheet	read:	 <i class="calibre3">The	undersigned	assumes	command	of	Bravo	Company,	2nd</i> <i class="calibre3">Battalion,	432nd	Armor. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">She	signed	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Antal	stood	at	attention	and	saluted.	“Thank	you,	ma’am,	for	the	opportunity	to have	my	first	command.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	returned	the	salute.	“Thank	you,	Lieutenant.	I	can	see	you’ve	done	a	great job	in	my	absence.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,	Lieutenant.	Let’s	go	introduce	you	to	your	new	company.”	Elkins headed	out	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Antal	followed.	“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	paid	the	bill	to	the	cashier	as	Valerie	talked,	and	they	walked	out	the door	into	the	bitter	cold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	just	can’t	believe	it,”	Valerie	said.	“We	can’t	even	get	any	appointments!	No one	in	Washington	wants	to	talk—all	I	hear	is	they’ll	check	and	get	back	with	us later,	and	of	course	they	never	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	frowned	as	he	watched	his	daughter.	Her	brow	was	furrowed,	and	some of	the	care	lines	on	her	face	looked	permanent.	Where	did	the	time	go?	In	the blink	of	an	eye	she’d	gone	from	being	a	gangly,	shy	teen	to	an	adult,	a	strong, competent	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	only	Martha	were	still	alive.	She	would	have	been	so	proud	of	their	daughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	walked	along	the	promenade	on	the	Kanahwa	River	through	the	center	of town.	She	shivered	and	hunched	her	shoulders	in	her	coat	as	an	icy	breeze	blew at	them	from	the	river. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	don’t	they	talk	to	us,	Dad?	It’s	like	they	want	it	to	come	to	war.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p372"></a>Murphy	shook	his	head.	“I	don’t	know,	hon.	I’m	beginning	to	think	some	people do.	There’s	always	someone	who	thinks	war	is	worth	it.	People	who	don’t understand	how	much	death	and	pain	will	come.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	we	going	to	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	do	the	best	we	can.	You	and	Al	Clark	keep	doing	what	you	can	to	negotiate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually	someone	will	come	out	to	talk	to	you.	And	I’ll	have	to	keep	doing what	I’m	doing,	preparing	a	defense.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	bad	can	it	get?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	pretty	bad.	We’re	not	prepared	for	this—we	don’t	have	the	fuel,	or	the ammunition,	or	the	personnel	to	defend	this	state	more	than	a	couple	of	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	if	it	does	come	to	war,	the	death	toll,	especially	for	civilians,	is	going	to	be brutal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But…	They	talk	so	much	about	how	the	military	works	so	hard	to	avoid	civilian casualties.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	nothing	but	a	polite	fiction,	Valerie.	You	can’t	have	a	war	without	civilian casualties.	The	whole	essence	of	the	thing	is	chaos.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stopped	and	turned	towards	the	river,	her	hands	crossed	over	her	chest.	She looked	up	at	the	stars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dad,	did	you	ever	cheat	on	Mom?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ken	was	startled	by	the	question.	He	glanced	over	at	her,	silent,	then	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Once.	A	very	long	time	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	stood	in	silence,	then	Ken	went	on.	“Valerie,	your	Mom	and	I…	God,	we were	sixteen	when	we	started	dating,	got	married	when	we	were	nineteen,	and you	were	born	only	a	year	later.	Neither	of	us	knew	what	we	wanted	in	life, where	we	were	going.	I	don’t	think	it	ever	occurred	to	us	we	might	ever	want someone	else.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	you	didn’t	love	each	other?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	we	did.	That’s	not	at	all	I’m	saying.	Martha…	She	was	life	to	me,	and	part</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p373"></a>of	me	has	been	dead	since	we	lost	her.	We—we	were	partners	in	life.	Your mother	meant	more	to	me	than	anything	else	in	the	world,	except	you	and…	you and	Kenny.	I	mean,	the	job,	the	house—all	that	could	have	been	gone,	we	could have	lived	in	a	shack,	and	I	still	would	have	felt	like	my	life	was	good	as	long	as I	had	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	frowned.	“Then	what	happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	life	happened.	I	guess	you	were	about	nine	or	ten	then,	I	was	in	Kentucky for	training,	a	couple	of	years	before	I	went	to	Iraq	the	second	time.	One	of	the other	students…	We	spent	a	couple	of	weekends	together.	Not	much	more	than that.”	He	smiled.	“You	would	recognize	her	name	if	I	told	you	who	she	was.	She was	one	of	the	first	female	armor	officers,	and	outranks	me	by	a	long	shot	these days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	funny.	I	never	intended	or	even	thought	about	leaving	Martha.	I	think	we might	have	been	a	little	bit	in	love	for	a	time,	there	at	Fort	Knox,	but	that	doesn’t mean	much	compared	to	what	your	mother	and	I	had.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	she	would	have	understood.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Martha?	Yes,	she	did.	She	knew	about	it	years	ago.	Things	were	rocky	for	a while,	but	we	got	past	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	smiled.	“I	should	have	known	you	told	her	the	truth.	Do	you	know,	if anyone	else	on	Earth	had	told	me	that	story	about	you,	I	would	have	called	them a	liar.	‘Not	my	Dad,’	I	would	have	said.	He’s…	He’s	like	a	hero,	the	perfect man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	hardly	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	but	you	are	honest,	and	you’ve	always	tried	to	do	the	right	thing,	even when	it	hurt	you	personally.	I’ve	always	admired	you,	Dad.	I	mean,	even	now, all	this—I	understand	what	you’re	doing,	and	why	you	have	to	do	it.	I	guess that’s	what	I	wanted	to	say	to	you	all	along.	I	understand,	and	I’m	proud	of	what you	are	trying	to	do.	I	just	wish	Mom	and	Kenny	could	be	here	to	see	you—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stifled	a	sob	as	Murphy’s	eyes	watered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	do,	too,	Valerie.	God,	I	do,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p374"></a>“Dad…	All	I	ask	is	please	don’t	get	yourself	killed.	That’s	all.	You’re	all	I	have left.	Okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	do	my	best,	Valerie.	I	can	promise	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	guess	it	has	to	be	enough.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	held	out	his	hands	and	pulled	his	daughter	to	him,	his	face	twisted	in	agony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	going	to	be	okay?”	she	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	will.	I	will.	I	just—I	just	miss	my	little	boy.”	Murphy’s	voice	broke	and	his eyes	filled	with	tears.	He	sobbed	and	buried	his	face	in	her	shoulder,	struggling to	contain	his	emotion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	miss	him,	too,”	she	whispered.	“And	Mommy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Forty-five	minutes	later,	Murphy	drove	back	to	his	temporary	headquarters	in	a borrowed	State	government	staff	car.	He	fumbled	through	the	channels	on	the radio	and	found	the	all-news	station,	then	stopped	the	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	newscaster	spoke,	voice	at	a	high	pitch.	“That’s	right,	folks,	they’ve	done	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	House	has	passed	the	Independence	Bill	thirty-three	to	twelve.	A	companion bill	is	on	its	way	through	the	Senate	and	may	pass	any	day	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	switched	the	radio	off.	They	were	headed	off	the	edge	of	a	cliff,	and there	wasn’t	a	thing	he	could	do	about	it.	He	couldn’t	help	but	wonder	what Martha	would	have	thought	of	all	this.	What	would	she	have	told	him?	Flee	the state?	Quit	the	guard,	as	his	brother	had	advised? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	didn’t	think	so.	Martha	would	have	wanted	him	to	stick	by	his	principles.	But what	about	the	cost? </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	drove	back	to	the	headquarters,	snow	began	to	fall. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p375"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	Thirty-Three</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">December	6</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	looked	down	into	the	tank.	Inside,	Sergeant	First	Class	Tom	Catlett	sat with	two	new	recruits	and	demonstrated	how	to	load	the	main	gun.	With	a	clang, he	opened	the	ammo	door,	pulled	out	an	armor	piercing	sabot	round	and	in	a smooth	motion	flipped	it	over	his	arm,	then	slid	it	home	into	the	main	gun.	All told,	the	action	took	about	two	and	a	half	seconds.	The	practice	round	was	a	little shorter	than	a	combat	one:	a	real	sabot	round	consisted	of	a	ten	pound	slug	of uranium,	traveling	at	such	a	high	velocity	that	the	kinetic	energy	would	destroy an	armored	target. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	see	how	that	goes?	It’s	all	one	smooth	motion.	These	rounds	are	heavy,	so it’s	all	about	balance,	when	you	flip	that	thing	over	your	arm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Catlett	opened	the	breach	and	replaced	the	training	round	in	the	ammo	rack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	new	recruits	looked	at	each	other,	clouds	of	condensation	rising	from	their breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	try,	Donaldson.”	Catlett	climbed	out	the	hatch	to	give	the	trainee	room	to move	across	the	turret. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ma’am,”	he	murmured	to	Karen,	then	looked	down	inside.	The	young	man	sat in	the	loaders	seat.	He	looked	up	at	Catlett,	face	pensive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gunner!  <i class="calibre3">Sabot! </i>	Tank!”	shouted	Catlett. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	recruit	hit	the	knee	switch	and	the	door	rolled	open.	He	fumbled	with	the catch,	and	then	slid	the	round	out.	As	he	started	to	flip	it	over,	it	slammed	into the	hatch	above	him.	He	cried	out	in	pain;	he’d	jammed	his	finger.	He	dropped the	round	on	the	floor.  <i class="calibre3">Oh,	God,	these	kids	were	never	going	to	be	ready	in	time. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Donaldson,	goddammit!	You	and	your	entire	crew	are	dead.	Those	rounds	have a	combustible	casing.	You	put	that	down	on	the	floor	next	to	hot	brass	and	it	will explode	inside	the	turret.	Holy	Christ,	don’t	do	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p376"></a>“But	Sarge,	I	hurt	my	finger.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,	you	hurt	your	little	finger,	and	then	you	killed	your	crew.	Think	I	care about	your	finger?	Do	it	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Greenfield	nodded	to	Catlett.	“Doing	a	great	job,	Sergeant.	Let	me	get	out	of your	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	slid	off	the	cold	turret,	and	then	dropped	down	to	the	pavement.	As	she	hit the	ground	again,	she	heard	Catlett	shout	again,	this	time	calling	for	a	high explosive	round:	“Gunner!  <i class="calibre3">Heat! </i>	Tank!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	pushing	as	hard	as	they	could	to	prepare	a	defense,	get	the	supplies laid	in,	and	train	the	new	recruits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	just	the	troops.	She	had	just	spent	three	grueling	days	in	a	computerized battle	simulation	with	the	other	officers	in	the	battalion.	With	virtually	no	sleep, and	with	her	company	getting	picked	off	by	attack	helicopters,	she	had	attempted a	counterattack	and	failed,	killing	her	entire	company	in	the	process. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	only	thing	that	drove	her	now	was	exhaustion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sighed	and	walked	toward	the	maintenance	platoon,	where	two	of	the	tanks were	being	repaired.	Time	to	get	back	to	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	looked	out	his	windowshades	at	the	frozen	lawn.	No	one	was	out	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	called	the	Provost	Marshal’s	office	twice	before	the	reporters	were thrown	out	of	the	base	housing	area—which	was,	after	all,	on	a	restricted government	installation.	It	had	reached	the	point	where	neither	he	nor	his neighbors	could	get	in	and	out	of	their	houses	without	being	accosted	by	the press.	It	was	one	thing	for	him,	but	his	next-door	neighbor,	Captain	Wilson Cline,	had	complained	loudly	after	his	thirteen-year-old	daughter	had	been interrogated	by	the	press	on	her	way	home	from	school.	She	had	burst	into	tears and	run	into	the	house,	and	that	was	the	last	straw. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p377"></a>He	reached	for	the	door	and	froze	when	the	phone	rang.	He	hesitated.	Why	not let	the	machine	get	it? </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">What	if	it’s	Savannah? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	ran	to	the	phone	and	picked	it	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello?	Captain	Morris	speaking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Morris,	this	is	Ben	Wharton.	The	scuttlebutt	over	here	is	Colonel	Sheeman finished	his	recommendation,	and	the	commanding	general	hasn’t	signed	off	on it	yet.	It	may	be	the	general	doesn’t	care	for	Sheeman’s	conclusions,	which	could only	be	good	for	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	frowned.	“How	could	it	be	good,	sir?	He	doesn’t	have	to	pay	attention	to them	anyway;	Sheeman	even	said	that.	General	Blake	can	do	whatever	he	wants regardless	of	Sheeman’s	recommendation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	true,	but	it	is	extremely	rare	to	overturn	the	findings	of	an	Article	32</p>
<p class="calibre1">investigation.	It	looks	really	bad	for	the	Army	to	conduct	an	investigation	and then	ignore	its	own	findings.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I	suppose	it	is	good	news.	How	long	will	it	be?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	shouldn’t	be	long	at	all.	General	Blake	doesn’t	typically	sit	on	this	sort	of thing.	My	guess	is	the	only	reason	it	has	taken	so	long	so	far	is	pressure	from	the White	House.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	if	the	White	House	wants	to	see	me	behind	bars,	why	doesn’t	General Blake	just	salute	and	take	his	marching	orders?	Why	the	hell	all	the	pretense?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wharton	did	not	answer	immediately,	and	when	he	did	his	tone	was	angry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because,	Captain,	there	are	still	plenty	of	officers	in	the	Army	with	integrity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Think	about	it	this	way,	Morris.	If	Blake	goes	against	what	the	White	House wants,	you’ll	go	free,	right?	But	will	Blake	ever	get	his	third	star?	Think	he’ll ever	get	a	theater	command?	Not	likely.	He	might	as	well	turn	in	his	retirement papers	when	he’s	finished	with	you.	So	quit	feeling	sorry	for	yourself,	Morris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	are	not	the	only	person	who	might	get	whacked	by	this	thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	listened,	Morris	heard	footsteps	coming	up	the	gravel	walk.	He	leaned	out</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p378"></a>of	the	kitchen,	toward	the	window,	but	couldn’t	see	who	it	was.	Whoever	it	was pushed	an	envelope	through	the	slot	in	the	door	and	it	fell	to	the	floor.	From	the kitchen,	Morris	couldn’t	see	who	it	was	from,	but	hand	delivery	was	pretty unusual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	you	hold	on	a	moment,	sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	set	the	phone	on	the	counter	and	walked	to	the	envelope.	From	Base Housing?	He	ripped	it	open	and	scanned	through	it,	and	then	started	to	laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	walked	back	to	the	phone,	still	half	amused	by	the	letter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi,	sir,	sorry	about	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	it?	Are	you	okay,	Mike?	You	sound	funny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	amused,	sir.	It	seems	now	my	wife	is	divorcing	me	and	left	with	my daughter,	I’m	no	longer	entitled	to	base	housing.	I’ve	been	given	two	weeks’</p>
<p class="calibre1">notice	to	move	out	into	bachelor	officer’s	quarters.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wharton	grunted,	and	then	said,	“At	least	you	don’t	have	much	stuff	to	move.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	looked	back	at	the	empty	house.	“True,	true.	Let	me	know	as	soon	as	you hear	anything,	please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	will.	Get	some	rest,	Morris.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	distance	between	Fort	Meade	to	Harpers	Ferry	was	only	a	little	over	an hour’s	drive,	well	within	the	driving	distance	of	the	two-hour	limit	imposed	by Morris’s	unit’s	alert	posture.	Not	that	he	was	likely	to	be	alerted	for	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	kept	the	music	turned	up	loud	and	tapped	his	hands	on	the	steering wheel,	deliberately	not	thinking	about	where	he	was	going.	Virtually	all	of	the radio	stations	played	Christmas	music,	since	it	was	only	two	days	away.	This would	be	his	third	year	in	a	row	away	from	Savannah	on	Christmas.	Three	years, half	of	her	short	life.	He	understood	why	Alicia	was	angry,	if	only	because	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p379"></a>that.	Would	Savannah	grow	up	never	having	a	Christmas	to	remember	with	her father? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	turned	the	music	up	louder.	He’d	finally	stopped	at	a	gas	station	and picked	up	a	disc	of	Golden	Oldies	from	the	Eighties.	Better	than	the	Christmas music. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	everyone	else	in	the	country,	Morris	had	seen	the	dramatic	news	coverage of	the	National	Guard	swooping	in	on	helicopters	and	forcing	the	federal	agents to	disarm.	He	was	amazed	it	hadn’t	turned	into	a	bloodbath.	In	the	end,	though,	it affected	him	on	a	personal	level,	because	a	few	days	later	he	got	an	e-mail	from Karen	that	indicated	she	was	back	with	her	tank	unit	and	in	the	general	area	of Harpers	Ferry.	Harpers	Ferry,	which	was	not	too	far	a	drive	from	Fort	Meade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	pulled	around	a	curve	in	the	highway,	and	there	it	was,	just	across	the	river. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	had	been	hesitant	when	he	called.	She	was	very	busy	training	her	unit,	no time	to	meet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	a	few	hours,”	Morris	had	said.	“We…	we	may	not	have	the	opportunity again	for	a	long	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Traffic	came	to	a	halt,	and	Morris	leaned	over,	trying	to	see	around	the	line	of cars	ahead	of	him.	Traffic	was	moving,	but	very	slowly,	across	the	curving bridge	over	the	Shenandoah.	Beyond	the	bridge	was	a	rising	slope	and	woods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	far	side	of	the	bridge,	a	lone	tank	stood	guard,	a	dozen	men	with HUMMWVs	standing	around	it,	watching	the	cars	crossing	the	bridge.	They weren’t	stopping	any	vehicles,	but	they	were	watching.	To	Morris,	it	was menacing.	They	were	there	to	quickly	seal	the	border,	he	supposed,	in	the	event the	West	Virginia	Legislature	passed	its	lunatic	independence	measure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Twenty	minutes	after	crossing	the	bridge,	he	turned	left	onto	a	gravel	driveway almost	in	the	woods	and	saw	her	house	for	the	first	time.	It	was	a	low	rambler,	at least	fifty	years	old,	in	varying	stages	of	restoration.	Surrounded	by	woods,	and situated	with	a	reasonable	view	of	the	valley	below,	it	had	a	rustic	feel,	almost like	a	cabin.	Morris	parked	the	car	behind	a	mud-spattered	gas	hybrid.	Slowly, he	stepped	out	into	the	cold	and	approached	the	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	opened	the	door	before	he	reached	it,	and	he	caught	his	breath.	Instead	of the	combat	gear	he’d	last	seen	her	in,	she	wore	a	simple	blouse	and	blue	jeans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	red	auburn	hair	hung	in	loose	curls	at	her	neck,	and	she	smiled.	Morris</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p380"></a>looked	at	her,	seeing	her	delicate	neck,	the	swell	of	her	breasts	under	the	blouse, her	hips.	He	felt	lightheaded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	opened	the	screen	door.	“Come	on	in,	Mike.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stepped	inside	the	door,	brushing	against	her,	and	even	the	small	touch	was charged	emotionally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	want	a	beer?”	She	walked	to	the	refrigerator,	giving	no	clue	she’d	been	at all	conscious	of	the	light	touch	as	he	passed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,”	he	replied.	She	leaned	in	and	pulled	a	bottle	out,	then	popped	the	top	on a	bottle	opener	mounted	to	the	cabinet	next	to	the	refrigerator.	She	sat	at	the scarred	kitchen	table	and	motioned	for	him	to	do	likewise,	passing	him	the	beer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had	a	cup	of	coffee,	sitting	on	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	took	his	jacket	off	and	hung	it	on	the	coat	rack	next	to	the	door.	Her	helmet and	web	gear	hung	from	the	rack,	next	to	a	shoulder	holster	with	the	letters	U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">stamped	into	it,	a	black	pistol	still	in	the	holster.	She	was,	after	all,	a	tank commander. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	only	got	a	few	hours	away.	I’m	sure	you	can	imagine	what	it’s	like	right now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Indeed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	missed	you.	Tell	me	how	you’ve	been.”	He	stared	at	her	eyes	as	he	spoke, felt	simultaneously	awkward	and	elated	to	be	with	her	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Better	than	the	last	couple	of	weeks,”	she	replied.	“For	a	while	there	in Morgantown	it	was	like	a	prison.	They	cut	off	all	the	outside	phone	lines	and started	blasting	terrible	music	loud	enough	to	shake	the	walls.	It	was	a	big	relief to	get	out	of	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	took	a	sip	of	his	beer.	“What	are	you	going	to	do	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	the	long	run?	I	don’t	know.	All	I’m	worried	about	right	now	is	leading	my company.	We’ve	got…	We’ve	got	a	hell	of	a	job	ahead	of	us.	What	about	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shrugged.	“I	don’t	know.	I’m	still	in	limbo.	The	Article	32	investigation	is</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p381"></a>over,	but	the	investigating	officer	still	hasn’t	handed	up	a	recommendation.	My lawyer	says	he	thinks	the	investigating	officer	wants	to	drop	the	whole	matter, but	the	thing	is	being	driven	by	politics.	Apparently	someone	in	the	White	House wants	to	see	me	go	up	the	river.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	want	someone	to	blame	this	mess	in	West	Virginia	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	that’s	idiotic,”	she	said,	her	voice	contemptuous.	“This	thing	was	moving along	well	before	you	came	into	the	picture.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Karen,	why	in	God’s	name	are	you	doing	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled.	“I	swore	to	protect	and	defend	the	Constitution	of	the	United	States. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	love	my	country,	and	I	can’t	stand	to	see	politicians	and	the	DHS	ripping	the heart	out	of	it	to	enrich	themselves.	It’s	personal,	too,	Mike.	Seven	months	ago	I saw	federal	agents	gun	down	a	friend	of	mine	for	no	good	reason.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	that	was	horrible,	Karen,	but	it	was	only	one	incident.	I	can	see	raising hell,	suing	them	or	something,	but	this?	I	don’t	get	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	it	wasn’t	one	incident.	It’s	been	happening	over	and	over.	Think	about	it, Mike.	The	government	arrests	and	holds	people	without	access	to	attorneys	on an	indefinite	basis.	Why?	They	are	 <i class="calibre3">suspected</i>	of	involvement	with	terrorism.	All DHS	has	to	do	is	level	an	accusation,	secretly	at	that,	and	they	can	pick	you	up from	your	house	at	night	and	lock	you	away	and	not	tell	anyone.	We’re	being watched	in	churches,	and	in	political	rallies,	in	town	meetings,	on	the	Internet, phone	lines	are	tapped,	and	it	just	gets	worse	and	worse.	We	have	to	do something	about	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shook	his	head.	“Wow.	I	don’t	know	what	to	say.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	closed	her	eyes	and	leaned	her	head	back,	looking	at	the	ceiling.	He	watched her—the	slender	neck	and	chin—and	wished	he	could	touch	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	say	anything.	You	don’t	have	to	understand.	I’m	not	trying	to	persuade you	to	join	us;	I	know	it’s	not	something	you	would	do.	So	what’s	the	point?”	As she	said	it,	tears	formed	in	her	eyes.	“It	was	a	mistake,	what	I	wrote.	Asking	you here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p382"></a>Morris	moved	without	thinking,	leaning	close	to	her	chair,	touching	her	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Karen,	it	was	not	a	mistake.	I	made	the	mistake—the	biggest	mistake	of	my	life</p>
<p class="calibre1">—when	I	lost	you.	Let’s	not	compound	that	mistake	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled;	all	the	while	tears	streamed	down	her	face.	“It’s	impossible,	Mike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	going	to	end	up	in	prison	or	dead.	For	God’s	sake,	the	attorney	general	of	the United	States	has	publicly	announced	he’s	seeking	my	execution.	We	only	get that	far	if	we	live	through	the	next	few	weeks,	and	that’s	pretty	chancy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing’s	impossible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	will	you	do	if	you	meet	me	on	a	battlefield?”	she	asked.	“I	won’t	hesitate to	do	my	duty.	My	men	depend	on	me,	and	I	won’t	let	them	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	chill	ran	through	him.	“Do	you	seriously	believe	it	will	come	to	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	it	will.	At	this	point	there’s	no	other	alternative,	unless	the	President decides	to	just	let	it	go,	which	is	never	going	to	happen.	There’s	going	to	be	a war,	and	unlike	all	these	Third	World	little	interventions	all	over	the	world,	this one	will	be	against	a	well-armed	and	well-trained	opponent	who	knows	your tactics	and	equipment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	care.	I	threw	away	seven	years	of	what	could	have	been	our	life together.	Karen,	if	I	die	tomorrow,	or	get	court-martialed	and	thrown	into	prison, I	want	my	last	memory	to	be	of	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	watched	her	slightly	parted	lips,	her	accelerated	breathing,	and	he	knew she	felt	something.  <i class="calibre3">Something. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	did	it	have	to	come	to	this?	There’s	no	future	for	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	there	be	a	present	for	us,	then,”	he	whispered,	running	his	fingers	through her	curls.	His	hand	touched	her	shoulder,	her	neck,	the	side	of	her	cheek,	and	her breath	quickened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	reached	out	with	his	other	hand,	framed	the	other	side	of	her	face.	They stood,	their	lips	just	brushed,	and	he	nearly	sobbed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	never	stopped	loving	you,	you	bastard,”	she	whispered.	“Nothing	was	the same	after,	nothing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p383"></a>He	stood	and	pulled	her	shaking	body	to	stand	with	him.	“I’ve	hated	myself	for seven	years.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	in	her	wide	brown	eyes	and	wondered	what	she	thought,	what	she felt,	as	she	looked	back.	Slowly,	slowly,	he	ran	his	fingers	through	her	hair,	the red	locks	parting	easily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	bodies	brushed	just	barely	along	their	entire	lengths,	and	Morris	nearly gasped	from	the	shock.	He	kissed	her,	on	the	lips,	on	the	chin,	on	the	neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	she	leaned	her	head	back,	his	lips	brushed	her	neck	and	he	whispered,	“I’d die	before	losing	you	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shut	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	didn’t	talk	any	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	White	House,	please,”	Valerie	said	to	the	cab	driver	as	she	got	in.	She	slid over	to	the	seat	behind	the	driver,	and	Clark	got	in	beside	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Each	of	them	had	a	small	overnight	bag,	no	real	luggage.	This	wasn’t	expected to	be	a	long	trip.	After	days	of	calling	every	contact	they	had	in	Washington, they’d	finally	managed	to	arrange	a	meeting—not	with	the	President,	but	with his	National	Security	Advisor.	It	was	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	lucky	they’d	taken	an	early	flight.	They	were	pulled	off	the	plane	and thoroughly	searched	on	their	arrival	at	National	Airport.	Clark	had	restrained	any anger;	it	was	clear	the	airport	personnel	had	no	choice	in	the	matter.	They	rode silently	in	the	cab.	They	had	already	talked	about	their	strategy	at	length,	and Valerie	was	still	angry	about	the	search. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Twenty	minutes	later	they	showed	their	identification	at	the	gate	of	the	White House. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	immediately	obvious	something	was	painfully	wrong.	After	the	first	secret service	agent	examined	their	identification,	he	said,	“Please	wait	here,”	and	went to	a	telephone.	Five	minute	later	two	more	agents	appeared,	in	plainclothes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p384"></a>“Come	this	way,	please,”	one	said,	his	tone	brooking	no	argument. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	agent	led	them	to	a	small	room,	not	in	the	White	House,	but	in	the	small guard	building	near	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	just	a	formality,	ma’am,”	said	one	of	the	agents,	“but	we	have	to	ensure you	have	no	weapons	on	you	before	you	enter	the	building.	Please	hold	your arms	out	to	your	side.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	other	agent	said	something	similar	to	Clark	on	the	other	side	of	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	raised	her	arms	at	her	side.	She’d	been	in	the	West	Wing	half	a	dozen times,	and	nearly	always	followed	the	same	routines.	This	was	new. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	agent	ran	a	wand	over	her,	which	let	out	a	piercing	tone	as	it	passed	over	her shoes	and	her	chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	have	to	ask	you	to	get	undressed,	ma’am,”	the	agent	said.	Across	the	room, she	could	see	Clark’s	face	flushed	with	anger	as	he	took	his	coat	and	shoes	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	are	you	doing	this?”	she	said.	“It’s	not	as	if	we	haven’t	been	here	before, more	than	once.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“New	procedure,	ma’am.	We	have	no	way	of	guaranteeing	your	behavior,	so	we have	to	be	extra	careful.	Those	are	my	orders.	It’s	nothing	personal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	eyes	were	cold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	go	find	a	female	agent,	then.	I’m	not	getting	undressed	in	front	of	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ma’am,	I’m	afraid	no	one	else	is	available	right	now.	You	are	welcome	to	wait, but	I	don’t	expect	we’ll	have	a	female	agent	around	for	several	hours.	You’ll likely	miss	your	appointment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stared	at	him.	He	was	lying,	the	son	of	a	bitch.	They	were	at	an	impasse.	She had	to	get	into	the	building	in	order	to	meet	with	the	national	security	advisor.	To do	that,	she	had	to	submit	to	this	humiliating	examination.	She	sighed,	then started	to	take	her	clothes	off.	She	could	see	Clark	do	the	same	thing,	his	face twitching	in	rage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently	even	that	wasn’t	enough,	as	the	agents	poured	out	the	contents	of	her</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p385"></a>purse	and	Clark’s	briefcase	and	went	through	them,	one	by	one.	For	this,	they worked	as	a	team,	with	one	agent	identifying	the	item	in	his	hand	and	the	other writing	it	down	in	a	notebook.	Of	course	there	was	nothing	to	find. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	got	dressed	again	as	they	went	through	her	purse,	item	by	item, cataloguing	her	comb	and	compact,	her	lipstick	and	her	wallet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks	like	about	two	hundred	dollars	in	cash,”	the	agent	said	as	he	opened	the wallet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cell	phone,	with	a	headset.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Handheld	computer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	took	forty-five	minutes	for	them	to	complete	their	inventory.	Clark	looked	at his	watch	repeatedly.	Finally,	they	were	led	into	the	West	Wing.	Both	agents flanked	them	as	they	met	with	a	twenty-something-year-old	intern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi,	I’m	Matt	Harris.	Let	me	escort	you	to	the	national	security	advisor’s	office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	has	two	more	appointments	lined	up	this	morning,	so	I	don’t	know	how	much time	you	will	have.	You’re	quite	late.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	wanted	to	smack	the	smug	brat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	led	them	down	the	hall,	to	a	room	Valerie	recognized	as	being	directly	next	to the	Oval	Office.	He	gave	a	quick	knock	on	the	door	and	opened	it	just	enough	to lean	his	head	in	and	say	something.	A	second	later	he	stepped	back	and	the	door opened	wide	as	the	familiar	wizened	features	of	Carl	Metzenberger	came	to	the door.	Valerie	had	never	met	him	person,	but	she’d	seen	him	on	television	enough to	recognize	him	easily.	A	gaunt	man	with	thin	wisps	of	white	hair,	he	looked	far older	than	his	actual	fifty	years.	Metzenberger	was	an	academic,	and	had	been the	chair	of	the	Middle	Eastern	studies	department	at	Princeton	when	the President	appointed	him	to	his	current	position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Congressman	Clark?	Ms.	Murphy?	Please	come	in.	I’m	Carl	Metzenberger, National	Security	Advisor	to	the	President.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	followed	him	into	the	office,	significantly	smaller	than	the	President’s	next door.	The	windows	were	the	same	bluish	bulletproof	glass,	however,	and	looked out	toward	streets	that	had	been	closed	to	the	public	for	some	years	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p386"></a>“We’re	short	on	time	right	now—I’m	meeting	with	the	Ambassador	of	India	in twenty	minutes—but	we	have	time	for	a	quick	chat.	Coffee?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	thank	you,”	they	said	simultaneously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	said,	his	tone	sharp,	“We’ve	been	here	nearly	an	hour;	we	were	strip-searched	by	the	Secret	Service	before	coming	into	the	building.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Metzenberger	chuckled	a	little.	“Well,	you	know	the	Secret	Service.	They’re there	to	protect	the	President,	and	they	do	take	their	jobs	seriously.	So	tell	me, since	time	is	short,	what	exactly	is	the	purpose	of	this	visit.	Please	have	a	seat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	spoke,	he	pulled	off	his	coat.	Underneath,	he	wore	a	starched	white	shirt and	blue	suspenders.	He	sat	down	behind	his	desk	and	listened	as	Clark	and Valerie	sat	across	from	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	here	to	try	to	head	off	an	impending	war,”	Clark	said.	“I’m	sure	you know	as	well	as	I	do	that	West	Virginia	is	on	the	verge	of	declaring	its independence.	This	situation	is	a	powder	keg.	We	believe,	however,	if	the	federal government	were	to	take	some	specific	steps,	we	might	be	able	to	head	off	the vote	in	the	Senate	and	prevent	them	from	passing	the	bill.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Metzenberger	leaned	forward	with	his	elbows	on	his	desk,	his	fingers	tented	and covering	the	lower	half	of	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	sort	of	steps?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To	start	with,	I	would	close	the	offices	of	the	Department	of	Homeland	Security in	the	state.	Announce	reform	of	the	Department.	Drop	the	prosecution	of	Karen Greenfield.	I	would	ask	the	President	to	appoint	a	special	counsel	to	investigate the	death	of	Antoine	Jackson,	a	Harpers	Ferry	police	officer	who	was	killed	in	a bungled	DHS	raid,	and	find	out	who	gave	what	orders	when	the	Army	shot	a civilian	in	Charleston	last	month.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Metzenberger	leaned	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	are	asking	a	tremendous	amount	for	people	who	are	threatening	treason.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	met	Clark’s	eyes.	Not	a	good	opening. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p387"></a>“Sir,”	she	said,	“the	issue	isn’t	treason	at	this	point.	This	is	a	very	popular	issue in	West	Virginia.	The	people	there	feel	as	if	they	have	lost	all	of	their	civil	rights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	clearly	identify	the	culprit:	the	Department	of	Homeland	Security.	It’s	not just	in	West	Virginia;	the	entire	country	is	suffering.	The	agency	is	out	of control,	sir.	What	Representative	Clark	is	telling	you	is	that	with	only	a	few minor	steps,	you	might	be	able	to	prevent	a	war.	That’s	not	asking	too	much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Metzenberger	shook	his	head,	the	smile	leaving	his	face.	“Look,	you	and	I	both know	there	will	be	no	war.	The	West	Virginia	National	Guard	has	no	combat power.	They	have	no	fuel.	They	have	no	ammunition.	If	we	roll	the	Army	in there	it	will	be	over	in	a	day	or	two.	How	dare	you	sit	here	and	threaten	armed conflict	if	we	don’t	give	in	to	your	demands?	I	ought	to	have	both	of	you arrested	for	treason	right	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	not	threatening	anything,	Mr.	Metzenberger.	This	is	what	the	situation	is, whether	you	or	like	it	or	not.	It’s	well	known	that	I	opposed	the	referendum	in West	Virginia.	But	it	passed,	and	overwhelmingly.	If	you	take	seriously	any	of the	tenets	of	our	nation,	that	has	to	shake	you	to	the	bone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Metzenberger	shrugged.	“People	do	stupid	things,”	he	said.	“Why	should	West Virginia	be	any	different	than	the	rest	of	the	world?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,”	Clark	said.	“You	must	consider	the	possible	consequences	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	tell	you	what,”	Metzenberger	said.	“I’ll	talk	to	the	President	about	this	if you	promise	to	deliver	up	for	me	the	ringleaders	of	this	so-called	rebellion	so	we can	put	them	on	trial.	I	want	your	governor,	and	that	renegade	National	Guard Commander	Murphy—you’re	not	related	to	him,	are	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	my	father,”	she	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	wonderful.	You	have	those	two	and	that	trigger-happy	Captain	Greenfield turned	over	to	federal	authorities,	and	we’ll	consider	conducting	an	internal investigation	of	the	DHS.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	me	guess,”	Clark	replied.	“Then	the	report	of	the	investigation	will	be labeled	as	classified,	and	it	will	be	locked	up	and	never	acted	upon.	See,	we investigated.	There’s	no	problem.	Is	that	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Clark,	surely	you	are	not	suggesting	the	DHS	can’t	investigate	itself	with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p388"></a>integrity.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	it	can’t,”	Clark	cried.	“No	government	agency	can.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Metzenberger	shook	his	head.	“Then	there	is	nothing	more	to	say.	I’d	escort	you out,	but	I	have	another	appointment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stood.	The	appointment	was	over.	The	two	secret	service	agents	underlined his	effective	order	to	get	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	almost	cried	out	in	frustration.	“Sir,”	she	tried	one	last	time.	“You	have	to at	least	consider	some	of	this.	People	are	going	to	die.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	her	in	the	eyes.	“No,”	he	said.	“I	don’t.	Have	a	nice	afternoon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	and	walked	toward	the	Oval	Office.	Clark	and	Valerie	were	led	from the	building,	defeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	understand,”	she	said	as	they	walked	away	from	the	White	House.	“Why won’t	they	talk	to	us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	didn’t	answer	for	a	moment,	then	said,	“They’re	being	tough,	I	guess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Can’t	give	in	to	terrorists	or	something.	Easier	than	trying	to	actually	solve	the problem.	Goddamn	stubborn	bastards.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	really	think	that’s	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	glanced	over	at	her.	“Yes,	unfortunately	I	do.	The	President	is	posturing	for the	cameras	and	showing	how	determined	a	leader	he	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	worried	about	my	Dad,	Al.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	worried	about	all	of	us,	Valerie.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p389"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	Thirty-Four</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">December	24</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	old	M1A1	Abrams	tank,	painted	in	a	black-and-green	camouflage	pattern, sat	in	a	dug-in	position	surrounded	by	trees	and	covered	by	extensive camouflage	netting,	which	had	been	further	covered	with	snow	the	night	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	didn’t	know	if	it	would	be	enough	to	fool	a	satellite,	but	there	was	little they	could	do	at	this	point.	From	the	position,	she	had	an	unobstructed	view	of the	highway	and	the	bridge	across	the	Shenandoah,	the	wooded	hills	of	the Harpers	Ferry	National	Historic	Park	rising	beyond.	Any	attack	into	her	sector would	come	from	one	of	two	places:	here,	on	U.S.	340,	or	the	Charlestown	Pike Bridge	on	Route	9	from	Loudon	County,	Virginia.	Crews	were	prepared	to	blow both	bridges	at	the	opening	of	hostilities,	but	her	main	concern	was	here:	Route 340	was	a	large	divided	highway,	the	river	crossing	shallow	enough	for	tanks and	armored	vehicles	to	make	it	across	the	rapids,	which	Sergeant	Catlett	told her	were	called	the	“staircase.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	crew	was	inside	the	tank,	staying	warm.	She	sat	nearby	at	a	picnic	table, with	the	platoon	leaders	and	platoon	sergeants	of	her	company,	going	over	the defense	plans	again.	She	held	a	plastic	travel	cup	filled	with	steaming	instant coffee.	She	hated	the	bitter-tasting	stuff	in	the	combat	rations,	but	it	tasted	better than	nothing	at	all,	at	least	when	mixed	with	chocolate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right.	I	talked	to	Major	Elkins.	We’re	authorized	to	let	the	company	go	at	50</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent	strength	for	today	and	tomorrow.	I’d	like	each	of	you	to	let	half	your platoon	go	for	the	remainder	of	today	and	overnight.	They	need	to	be	back	in position	by	0500,	because	that’s	when	the	rest	will	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	three	platoon	leaders	grinned.	Morale	was	a	huge	problem,	and	sending	folks home	for	Christmas	would	help	a	lot.	It	was	tough	to	be	away	from	home	for Christmas	when	you	could	literally	see	home	at	the	bottom	of	the	hill.	She	just hoped	they	would	all	come	back;	there	were	no	guarantees	at	this	point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Guidelines	are,	we	keep	fully	operable	crews	so	that	if	we	are	attacked	we	can mass	at	least	fifty	percent	of	our	combat	power.	And	make	sure	the	men	know not	to	discuss	our	defense	plans.	First	Sergeant,	can	you	make	arrangements	for the	supply	truck	to	take	the	men	to	their	homes	and	pick	them	up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p390"></a>Schumaker	responded.	“Yes,	ma’am.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	that’s	all	I’ve	got.	Any	questions?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	had	none.	She	stood	up	and	stretched,	then	fished	in	the	pocket	of	her	field jacket.	“Lieutenant	Britton,	you	want	to	flip	a	coin	for	which	crew	will	go	first, yours	or	mine?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	ma’am.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here	we	go,”	she	said,	squinting	at	a	dollar.	She	flipped	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tails,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	coin	landed,	backside	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	choice.	You	want	your	crew	to	take	Christmas	day?	I’ll	send	mine	today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	sounds	very	nice,	ma’am.”	He	had	a	big	grin	on	his	face.	Britton	had recently	married,	and	had	a	little	girl	at	home,	six	months	old.	Tough	to	be	away from	home	on	your	kid’s	first	Christmas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	turned	back	toward	her	tank,	only	to	see	Sergeant	Bowen,	her	gunner, climbing	out.	His	expression	was	grim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain,	we’ve	been	listening	to	the	news	in	here.	The	Senate	just	voted	for	the independence	bill.	It	passed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lieutenant	Britton	frowned.	“Should	we	cancel	sending	folks	home,	ma’am?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	she	murmured,	her	voice	low.	“Let	them	go,	it’ll	take	a	few	days	before the	governor	signs	it	and	it’s	official.	Let	the	guys	see	their	families	while	they have	the	chance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	climbed	onto	the	turret	of	her	tank,	sat	down	between	the	main	gun	and	the grenade	launchers	on	the	right	side,	and	looked	down	at	the	valley.	Spread	out below,	Harpers	Ferry	looked	peaceful,	covered	in	snow.	There,	far	down	below, was	the	bridge	the	enemy	would	cross,	possibly	in	just	a	few	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	crossed	her	arms	over	her	chest	and	leaned	forward,	huddling	against	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p391"></a>cold.	She	felt	a	biting	pain	in	her	cheeks,	and	realized	tears	were	freezing	on	her face.	She	brushed	them	away.	Time	to	get	inside	the	tank	and	warm	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Karen’s	men	prepared	for	their	brief	Christmas	visits	home,	planning proceeded	in	Murphy’s	still	busy	headquarters	in	Charleston.	Murphy	was standing	at	the	urinal	when	his	phone	rang,	its	irritating	tone	echoing	off	the	bare walls	of	the	bathroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dammit.”	He	quickly	zipped	up	as	the	phone	rang	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	finally	flipped	open	the	phone	and	answered,	his	voice	echoing	off	the	walls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello?”	“Ken?	It’s	Tom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	smile	broke	out	on	Murphy’s	face,	and	his	voice	echoed	in	the	bathroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tom,	it’s	good	to	hear	from	you.	How	are	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	spoke	he	walked	out	of	the	bathroom	and	toward	the	front	of	the	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	get	some	air	while	he	was	on	the	phone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	congratulate	you	on	your	promotion,	General,	but	under	the	circumstances	I don’t	know	if	I	should.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	sighed	as	he	reached	the	door	and	pushed	it	open.	Tommy’s	tone	was cold,	tightly	controlled	anger.	An	icy	cold	wind	hit	him,	bracing	him.	The	light outside	was	grey,	as	was	the	sky,	a	cold,	grim	day.	Icy	wind	blew	up	from	the Kanahwa	River,	stinging	his	hands	and	cheeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tom,	I	don’t	know	that	it’s	anything	to	be	proud	of.	I	ended	up	in	the	slot	for	a lot	of	reasons,	but	mostly	out	of	a	process	of	elimination.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ken,	I	don’t	understand.	Why?	Why	is	all	this	necessary?	Did	you	hear	the President’s	speech	this	morning?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	heard	what	he	said	about	the	West	Virginia	National	Guard?	That	as	of next	Monday	you	are	stripped	of	your	commission	in	the	Armed	Forces	if	you are	still	serving	in	West	Virginia?	They	are	going	to	charge	you	with	treason	if</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p392"></a>you	don’t	walk	away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	closed	his	eyes.	“Tom,	I	don’t	expect	you	to	understand.	We	tried	to	talk about	it	when	I	was	in	Atlanta,	and	you	didn’t	see	it	then,	either.	It’s	not	about me.	It’s	about	the	future	of	our	country.	I	don’t	want	to	fight	a	war,	but	I	won’t stand	by	while	the	President	and	his	cronies	trample	everything	we’ve	spent	our lives	fighting	for.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	spoke,	Murphy	stared	at	the	ground	and	wondered	if	that	was	what	it	was really	about.	Was	he	just	kidding	himself? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	heard	Tom	exhale	at	the	other	end.	“Look,	Ken,	I’m	sorry.	I	didn’t	call	you	to get	in	an	argument—I	just	wanted	to	see	how	you’re	making	out,	you	know…</p>
<p class="calibre1">since	Kenny	passed	away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	gave	a	helpless	shrug,	almost	as	if	his	brother	could	see	him.	“Tommy,	I don’t	know.	I…	just	keep	going.	Ever	since	Martha	died,	that’s	all	I	can	do.	Just keep	going,	one	step	forward.	You	know,	I	think	I	finally	said	goodbye	to	her, too,	there	at	Kenny’s	funeral.	I	just	feel…	empty,	now.	It’s	funny—those	last	few weeks,	he	was	doing	so	much	better.	I	guess	I	thought	we	were	going	to	have more	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	don’t	you	come	home,	Ken?”	Tommy	said,	his	voice	almost	pleading. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	resign—half	the	officers	there	have	already	quit.	The	politicians	are	crazy if	they	think	you	can	win	this	thing.	You	can	come	home,	maybe	bring	Valerie with	you,	and	have	your	family	here.	Mom	and	Dad	are	worried	sick.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t.	I	can’t	walk	away	from	my	responsibilities	here,	Tom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	the	President	has	called	up	50,000	reservists,	Ken.	And	my	brigade has	been	alerted;	we’re	loading	our	choppers	with	ammo.	It’s	going	to	be	a	war.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	love	you,	little	brother,	but	I	can’t	be	turned	aside	from	my	course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	will	you	do,	Ken?	When	my	brigade	rains	death	and	destruction	on	you and	your	people.	What	are	we	going	to	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	just	keep	going,	Tom.	Maybe	you	should	come	here.	I	could	use	a	good brigade	commander.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p393"></a>“I	would	never	betray	my	country,	Ken.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Neither	would	I,	Tommy.	The	country	we	grew	up	with	is	gone.	You’re	just	like the	guys	in	the	 <i class="calibre3">Wermacht</i>	eighty	years	ago,	defending	the	fatherland	when	the real	enemy	was	behind	them,	giving	the	orders.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ken,	I’ve	admired	you	my	whole	life.	But	this…	I	just	can’t	accept	it.	It’s	not just	your	life	you	are	throwing	away.	A	hell	of	a	lot	of	completely	innocent people	will	die	because	of	your	ideological	spin	on	things.	You	and	your	militia pals	out	there	are	starting	a	civil	war.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	where	you’re	wrong,	Tom.	There’s	been	a	long	running	democratic process	that	made	this	happen.	It’s	not	me	and	my	cronies.	It’s	the	will	of	the people.	And	they	are	right,	Tom.	They	are	 <i class="calibre3">right</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t	stand	by	while	you	betray	everything	our	family	stood	for.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	ask	you	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	love	you,	Ken.	But	I	don’t	know	if	we	can	be	brothers	anymore.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy’s	face	contorted,	and	tears	formed	in	his	eyes.	“You	said	that	when	you were	eight	years	old	and	I	punched	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom	sighed.	“Yeah,	but	I	meant	it	back	then.	Maybe	we’ll	see	each	other	when it’s	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.	Maybe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Goodbye,	Ken.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Goodbye,	Tom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	closed	the	phone	with	his	numb	fingers	and	pushed	it	back	onto	his	belt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	freezing,	but	not	ready	to	go	back	inside.	For	now,	he’d	stay	out	in	the cold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mike	Morris	looked	down	at	his	hands—and	his	own	wedding	ring—then	back</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p394"></a>up	at	the	altar.	The	ring.	He	sighed.	It	was	way	too	late	to	be	thinking	of	how much	he’d	screwed	up	his	own	marriage.	He	took	the	ring	off	and	slipped	it	into his	pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	one	more	thing	to	worry	about.	Sergeants	Kevin	Miller	and	Kathleen O’Donnell	had	shown	up	at	his	door	this	morning,	hand	in	hand,	and	announced their	intention	to	marry	before	deploying.	Everyone	knew	they’d	been	living together	for	some	time,	but	this	was	a	shock.	Married	couples	didn’t	deploy	to war	zones	in	the	same	infantry	unit.	Ever.	But	there	was	no	time	to	replace	a	key platoon	sergeant.	That	meant	Kevin	Miller’s	two	sons	from	his	first	marriage would	be	left	behind	with	one	set	of	grandparents.	Not	an	ideal	situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	lot	of	rearranging,	the	base	chapel	had	been	cleared,	and	two	precious hours	carved	out	of	the	deployment	schedule	for	the	entire	company	to	witness the	nuptials. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	that	Morris	had	much	to	do	with	it;	he	was	still	in	limbo.	He	wasn’t	relieved of	command,	but	his	XO	was	acting	as	company	commander.	All	the	same,	he’d packed	his	gear	and	prepared	for	deployment	like	the	rest.	Maybe	he’d	spend	the time	sitting	in	the	back	of	a	truck	at	battalion	headquarters.	Who	knew? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alicia	still	hadn’t	let	him	talk	to	Savannah.	The	hell	of	it	was,	he	could understand	her	anger.	He’d	put	her	through	hell,	dragging	her	all	over	the country,	deployment	after	deployment,	literally	years	away	from	home.	But	he’d never	forgive	her	for	cutting	him	off	from	Savannah.	Never. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	do,”	said	Sergeant	Kevin	Miller,	standing	at	the	altar	in	his	elegant	dress	blue uniform.	The	scar	on	his	forehead,	normally	not	prominent,	stood	out	in	high relief.	Kathleen	O’Donnell,	by	contrast,	looked	completely	relaxed.	Unusually out	of	uniform,	she	wore	a	plain	white	wedding	dress	and	a	beaming	smile.	The chaplain	turned	to	her	and	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris’s	attention	was	interrupted	by	Lieutenant	Colonel	Barksdale,	who	stood at	the	end	of	the	aisle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain	Morris,	I	need	to	speak	to	you.	It’s	urgent.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Right	in	the	middle	of	the	wedding? </i>	What	could	be	that	important? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,”	Morris	whispered.	He	slid	out	of	the	pew. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p395"></a>Behind	him,	he	heard	the	chaplain	say	the	last	words.	“You	may	kiss	the	bride.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	glanced	up	at	the	smiling	couple	and	his	mind	turned	to	Karen.	Not	likely they’d	ever	have	a	scene	like	this.	A	roar	rose	around	him	as	his	entire	company stood	up,	clapping	and	cheering.	The	families	of	the	couple	were	a	little	more reserved,	with	the	knowledge	that	they	were	deploying	into	a	probably	combat zone	almost	immediately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	followed	Barksdale	to	the	entrance	area.	A	cold	draft	blew	in	the	gap between	the	heavy	oak	doors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barksdale	spoke	quietly.	“You’re	ready	for	the	deployment?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	you	are	back	in	command.	Court-martials	be	damned,	I	need	an experienced	officer	in	that	slot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,	Morris.	The	President	has	ordered	an	immediate	offensive.	The	moment the	governor	of	West	Virginia	signs	that	bill	is	our	jumping	point.	They	don’t care	whether	all	the	assets	are	in	place	or	not;	I	guess	they	figure	the	National Guard	won’t	put	up	much	of	a	fight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	sound	like	you	don’t	agree,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t.	That’s	pretty	much	what	they	said	before	Bull	Run,	too.	We’ll	still	be fighting	Americans.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barksdale	turned	away,	and	Morris	said,	“Sir,	I	have	to	say	thank	you.	I appreciate	your	confidence.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barksdale	stopped	and	frowned.	“I	didn’t	do	it	for	you,	Morris.	Whatever	my personal	feelings	for	you,	you	are	a	capable	commander	and	you	think	clearly under	stress.	That	may	be	critical	for	the	survival	of	your	men.	For	all	I	care,	the minute	we	get	back,	they	can	cart	you	off	and	court-martial	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	did	not	reply,	and	Barksdale	relented.	“Maybe	this	is	a	chance	to	show your	true	colors.	I	could	be	wrong,	Captain.	I	hope	so.	I	heard	what	you	said	at</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p396"></a>your	hearing.	For	what	it’s	worth,	you	did	the	right	thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barksdale	walked	away,	and	Morris	turned	his	attention	back	to	the	cheering crowd.	The	newly	married	couple	made	their	way	down	the	aisle	as	raucous troops	on	either	side	clapped	and	shouted.	Something	else	to	take	care	of;	he couldn’t	have	a	married	couple	deploying	to	a	war-zone	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	time;	they	were	jumping	off	tonight.	As	soon	as	the	wedding	was	over,	his company	had	been	ordered	to	gather,	in	combat	gear,	at	the	battalion headquarters,	ready	to	deploy.	The	wedding	was	only	allowed	to	proceed	when the	base	chaplain	interceded	with	the	Division	Commander.	After	the	wedding, Mike	would	go	straight	to	the	company	and	change	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	slipped	outside	behind	Miller	and	O’Donnell.	Miller	had	two	sons	from his	first	marriage,	already	outside	with	the	grandparents.	Morris	watched	as	they hugged	the	two	crying	boys,	who	knew	their	parents	were	going	away	again	and not	on	a	honeymoon	as	planned.	The	remainder	of	the	company	followed,	their cheering	becoming	mute	as	they	saw	the	crying	boys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	older	man	with	white	hair	approached.	He	wore	a	pin	Morris	recognized:	a miniature	Southwest	Asia	Service	ribbon	from	the	first	Gulf	War	in	1991. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	Captain	Morris?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	Frank	O’Donnell.	Kathleen	is	my	daughter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.	You	should	be	very	proud	of	her,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">O’Donnell	nodded.	“I	am.	We’re	taking	the	kids	home	with	us.	I	just	came	to	ask you…	Take	care	of	them,	please.	Those	boys	need	their	parents.	Take	care	of	my little	girl.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	do	my	best,	sir.	I	promise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	that’s	all	I	can	ask.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	boys—both	still	crying—were	put	into	the	back	of	a	car	by	their	parents, and	a	hush	fell	over	the	infantrymen	who	had	been	cheering	before.	O’Donnell’s</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p397"></a>father	walked	away	from	Morris,	hugged	his	daughter,	and	shook	hands	with Sergeant	Miller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	sudden	quiet,	Morris	heard	the	wind	whip	through	the	power	lines	above their	heads.	He	looked	at	his	company,	mostly	men,	and	a	few	women	gathered around,	most	of	them	embracing	their	wives	and	children.	All	of	them	saying goodbye	to	someone,	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	had	already	said	his	goodbyes,	in	Harpers	Ferry	yesterday. </p>
<p class="calibre1">God	damn	politicians	and	their	wars.	That’s	the	way	it	always	was—some politician	somewhere	wanted	something,	and	it	was	the	infantry	and	their families	who	suffered	and	died	to	make	it	happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,”	the	first	sergeant	grumbled.	“Vacation	is	over,	folks.	I	want	everyone back	at	the	company	in	one	hour,	locked	and	loaded.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	gathering	on	the	front	steps	of	the	chapel	broke	up	and	the	men	and	women of	the	company	hurried	home	with	their	families,	to	change	out	of	their	dress uniforms	and	back	into	combat	gear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	going	to	war. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">January	1</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	America,	and	happy	New	Year.	This	is	Bill	Warner	with	Washington Talk.	Today	we	have	with	us	West	Virginia	Secretary	of	State	Albert	Clark,	and Vice	President	Robert	Hamilton	of	California.	We’ll	discuss	the	news	on everyone’s	mind:	West	Virginia’s	Declaration	of	Independence,	signed	by Governor	Frank	Slagter	this	morning.	We’ll	ask	these	gentlemen	their	views	on these	important	events,	and	give	you,	the	listener,	the	chance	to	call	in	your questions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Commercial,”	someone	shouted.	“180	seconds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vice	President	Hamilton,	a	tall	and	gaunt	man,	turned	to	their	host,	ignoring Clark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How’s	the	family,	Bill?	Still	getting	along	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	they’re	fine,	sir.	Dee	just	started	college	this	year,	believe	it	or	not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really.	Well,	that’s	wonderful.	You	know	mine	flew	the	coop	some	years	ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	a	difficult	time.	How	is	your	wife	taking	it?	Does	she	work?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,	she’s	a	neurology	professor	over	at	Georgetown	Medical	School.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thirty	seconds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	frowned.	Hamilton	still	looked	everywhere	possible	other	than	him.	This could	be	interesting.	The	Vice	President	was	nervous	about	something,	but what? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ten	seconds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	studio	went	silent	as	the	lights	came	up,	and	Warner	spoke	on	queue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	America.	This	is	Bill	Warner	with	Washington	Talk.	With	me	are	two men	on	opposite	sides	of	one	of	the	key	issues	facing	America	today.	On	my</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p399"></a>right,	Vice	President	Robert	Hamilton	will	speak	for	the	White	House’s	position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	my	left,	Secretary	of	State	Albert	Clark	of	West	Virginia.	Mr.	Clark	is	a former	U.S.	Congressman	and	is	leading	negotiations	on	behalf	of	West	Virginia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	first	key	question:	this	morning,	Governor	Frank	Slagter	signed	a	bill, passed	by	the	West	Virginia	legislature,	declaring	its	independence	from	the United	States.	For	the	first	time	since	1861	a	state	is	attempting	to	secede	from the	United	States.	Reactions?	Mr.	Vice	President?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	Bill,	I’ll	be	brief.	The	action	is	illegal,	and	dangerous.	It	will	put	the	lives of	thousands	of	people	at	risk,	all	to	placate	the	ambitions	of	a	few	men	like Governor	Slagter	and	Mr.	Clark	here.	It	is	treason,	and	the	United	States	will treat	it	as	such.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Clark.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	Vice	President,	one	thing	is	clear:	the	people	of	the	State	of	West	Virginia voted	overwhelmingly	for	this	measure	in	a	statewide	ballot.	The	people	heavily campaigned	their	representatives	to	vote	for	it	in	the	legislature.	I	was	personally opposed	to	the	measure,	spoke	out	against	it	and	voted	against	it,	but	there	is	a time	to	line	up	behind	the	will	of	the	people,	and	this	is	that	time.	You	can’t characterize	this	as	being	the	ambitions	of	one	or	two	men:	this	is	in	clear reaction	to	the	repeated	use	of	excessive	force	and	violations	of	civil	liberties	in our	state.	Key	point	here,	Bill:	we’re	at	the	brink	of	a	civil	war.	We	need	to	step back	the	rhetoric,	and	especially	step	back	the	mobilization	of	military	forces, before	it	goes	too	far.	It’s	not	too	late	to	stop	this	thing	from	becoming	an	open conflict,	but	only	the	President	has	the	power	to	stop	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	Mr.	Clark.	Next	question:	West	Virginia	activated	its	National Guard	some	weeks	ago,	and	about	a	week	ago	the	President	ordered	the mobilization	of	some	hundred	thousand	troops	in	the	United	States.	The impression	of	most	of	America	is	that	we	are	hurtling	towards	a	war.	The question	is:	how	do	we	prevent	it?	Mr.	Vice	President.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bill,	the	only	way	to	prevent	it	is	for	the	West	Virginians	to	back	off	this dangerous	path.	One-hundred	and	fifty	years	ago	President	Abraham	Lincoln established	one	undying	principal	that	this	country	has	stood	by:	the	Union	is indivisible,	and	the	parts	may	not	come	and	go	as	they	will.	No	one	wants	this	to come	to	a	war,	least	of	all	the	President.	But	the	President	must	do	his	part	to preserve	our	unique	union.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p400"></a>“Mr.	Clark.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark	looked	straight	at	the	camera	as	he	spoke.	“Now,	Bill,	in	most	situations, you	want	to	sit	down	and	talk	first,	before	you	start	shooting	at	people.	Let	me be	clear.	The	United	States	government	has	refused	to	talk,	has	refused	to negotiate,	has	refused	to	sit	down	and	even	meet	with	us.	The	President	could stop	this	right	now	if	he	would	merely	appoint	a	negotiating	team	to	sit	down, meet	with	our	people	and	work	out	our	differences.	Instead,	the	President	has sent	a	very	clear	message	that	there	will	be	no	negotiations,	and	if	we	don’t	do what	they	tell	us	they’ll	send	five	divisions	of	tanks	in	to	force	us.	We	must establish	a	basis	for	negotiation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	be	right	back	after	this	commercial	break.	This	is	Bill	Warner	with Washington	Talk.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sixty	seconds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Across	the	studio,	Valerie	Murphy	listened	with	one	ear	as	she	worked	on	her pocket	computer,	still	trying	to	arrange	meetings	at	any	level	with	the	U.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">government.	As	she	worked,	she	glanced	up	and	froze.	Three	men	in	matching black	suits	approached	her.	All	three	had	earpieces	with	wires	trailing	into	their coats,	and	dark	sunglasses	hid	their	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Valerie	Murphy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	agent	Lukeman	of	the	Department	of	Homeland	Security.	You	are	under arrest.	Please	set	the	computer	down	on	the	table	and	stand	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	set	the	computer	down,	slowly,	and	then	stood	as	instructed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	this	about?	Why	am	I	being	arrested?	Do	you	have	a	warrant?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	men	approached	her	and	said,	“Please	raise	your	arms	in	the	air,	right now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	did,	and	the	man	thoroughly	patted	her	down	for	weapons.	A	moment	later, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p401"></a>he	twisted	her	arms	behind	her	and	handcuffed	her	wrists,	too	tightly.	She	cried out	in	pain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Relax	your	arms	a	little,	it	won’t	hurt	so	much,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	did,	and	it	did	help	a	little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	other	agent	quickly	catalogued	her	purse,	and	placed	her	pocket	computer	in a	small	protective	case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	agents	forced	her	to	walk	out	of	the	studio	and	on	to	a	waiting	elevator.	She stumbled	getting	into	the	elevator	and	the	agents	simply	lifted	her	up	between them	and	carried	her	the	next	several	steps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	would	be	best	if	you	cooperated,”	the	agent	on	her	left	said	in	a	menacing tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	tripped,	you	ass.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	agent	on	her	right	snickered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	they	exited	the	building,	she	was	overwhelmed	by	the	sudden	shouting	and noise.	Fifty,	possibly	a	hundred	reporters	crowded	around	the	exit,	filming, shouting	questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shut	them	out	of	her	mind	as	the	agents	barged	their	way	through	the	crowd, shoving	reporters	out	of	the	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	shoved	a	camera	in	her	face	and	the	flash	went	off,	leaving	bright	spots in	her	eyes.	A	woman	screamed,	“Valerie,	are	you	being	arrested	for	treason?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Valerie	flushed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	agents	pushed	her	into	the	back	seat	of	an	unmarked	car.	With	her	hands cuffed	behind	her,	she	had	to	lean	forward,	unable	to	sit	back	all	the	way.	Her skirt	rode	up	to	her	thighs	as	she	sat,	and	she	couldn’t	fix	it.	Tears	of	frustration flooded	her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cameras	continued	to	flash	as	the	reporters	shouted	questions	at	her.	An</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p402"></a>agent	slammed	the	door	of	the	car,	then	got	into	the	driver’s	seat,	but	they continued	to	sit,	even	as	the	reporters	on	the	street	filmed	her	and	shouted questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What,	did	you	guys	call	the	press	in	advance?	You	don’t	have	any	grounds	for charges,	so	you’ll	just	publicly	brand	us,	is	that	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shut	up.”	The	order	was	delivered	in	a	deadly	tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	minutes	later	the	reporters	moved,	en	masse,	back	to	the	door.	Seconds later	Clark	appeared,	flanked	by	two	agents	who	pushed	the	reporters	back.	He held	his	head	high,	but	he,	too,	was	handcuffed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	shoved	him	into	the	car	in	front	of	her,	none	too	gently.	Seconds	later	both cars	sped	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Greenfield	keyed	the	switch	on	the	side	of	her	helmet.	“Block	the	road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	one	comes	through	unless	they	have	a	West	Virginia	driver’s	license	or	can substantiate	residence	or	family	here.	Pull	the	tank	right	into	the	middle	of	the road.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	watched	as	the	tank	below	drove	forward,	into	the	traffic	lanes	of	U.S.	340. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Traffic	immediately	came	to	a	halt	as	the	turret	swung	toward	the	other	side	of the	river.	One	car,	a	small	BMW,	backed	up	until	it	hit	the	guardrail	with	a screech	she	could	hear	all	the	way	up	here,	half	a	mile	a	way	on	the	heights.	A Ford	pickup	truck	with	a	tripod-mounted	machine	gun	pulled	into	position	next to	the	tank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	infantrymen,	rifles	slung	over	their	shoulders,	walked	toward	the	incoming cars	and	began	talking	to	the	drivers.	A	third	stood	guard	at	the	machine	gun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Good.	Everything	looked	calm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	her	right	hand	she	reached	back	down	into	the	turret	and	switched	the	radio to	the	battalion	network. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cornstalk	Six,	this	is	Bravo	Six,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	Cornstalk	Six,	over.”	Major	Vince	Elkins. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p403"></a>“Cornstalk	Six,	Objective	Green	is	secure,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roger,	Bravo	Six.	I	understand	Objective	Green	is	secure.	Cornstalk	Six	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	you	doing,	guys?”	she	asked	the	other	crewmembers	over	the	intercom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	others	answered	quietly,	the	mood	somber.	All	across	the	state	right	now, local	forces	moved	to	block	bridges	and	tunnels,	roads	leading	in	or	out	of	the state.	Before	the	day	was	over,	many	of	those	bridges	would	be	blown,	reducing the	lines	of	attack	ground	forces	could	take	into	the	state.	They	had	gone	from taking	abstract	political	steps	to	taking	very	concrete,	military	steps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	wondered	how	many	of	them	would	survive	the	coming	week. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	in,	General,	come	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	usual,	Frank	Slagter’s	tone	was	jovial,	friendly,	despite	the	deadly seriousness	of	this	visit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	Governor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter	led	Murphy	into	the	office,	and	as	before,	they	sat	at	the	table overlooking	the	decimated	site	of	the	federal	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	can	I	do	for	you,	General?	My	secretary	said	you	needed	to	see	me	right away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	here	about	two	things,	sir.	The	first	one	is	a	question.	How	are	things	on	the diplomatic	front?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter	frowned.	“Not	so	good,	General.	Secretary	Clark—and	your	daughter—</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	in	Washington	this	morning,	and	no	one	has	heard	from	them	since.	The news	is	reporting	they’ve	been	arrested.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Arrested?	For	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	couldn’t	guess,”	Slagter	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Dear	God. </i>	He	never	would	have	imagined	Valerie	would	be	in	danger.	Of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p404"></a>course,	she’d	be	safer	in	the	DC	lockup	than	here	in	Charleston. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	said	you	came	for	two	things,	General.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.	I’ve	ordered	an	evacuation	of	all	the	government	agencies	and buildings,	and	apparently	no	one	has	complied.	I	came	to	speak	to	you	about	it, because	you	are	in	a	position	to	enforce	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whatever	for,	General?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Governor,	it	is	very	likely	most	of	the	government	buildings	won’t	be	standing in	forty-eight	hours—including	this	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“General,	surely	it’s	not	likely	to	go	so	far.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	it	will,	sir.	Unless	you	come	up	with	a	diplomatic	solution.	If	this	thing comes	to	open	armed	conflict,	one	of	the	first	things	they	will	do	is	bomb	every government	facility,	every	power	plant,	every	bridge	in	the	state.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter	shook	his	head.	“General,	I	just	can’t	believe	the	President	would authorize	such	things.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	why	did	you	appoint	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why,	because	you	had	more	combat	experience	than	the	other	officers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	right.	I’m	your	military	advisor.	And	I	am	telling	you,	they	will	follow standard	operating	procedures	and	bomb	the	crap	out	of	this	place	as	soon	as they	realize	we’re	putting	up	serious	resistance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	General.	I’ll	order	the	evacuation.	I	do	hope	you	are	wrong.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	do	I,	sir.	I’ve	told	you	before—when	this	comes	to	war,	we	cannot	win. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Depending	on	the	weather	and	a	lot	of	other	things	I	can	probably	hold	the	state two	or	three	days,	but	no	longer.	You’ve	got	to	find	a	political	solution,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter	nodded,	and	Murphy	had	the	feeling	there	was	no	political	solution	in sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p405"></a>The	sun	was	almost	setting	as	the	column	came	to	a	halt	on	U.S.	340,	halfway between	Frederick,	Maryland	and	Harpers	Ferry,	West	Virginia.	Morris,	a	little unsteady	on	his	feet	after	the	long	drive	in	the	HUMMWV,	stepped	out	and	was immediately	hit	by	a	blast	of	cold	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	marched	up	the	column,	where	he	met	the	other	company	commanders	and Lieutenanant	Colonel	Barksdale.	The	officers	stood	huddled	in	their	field	jackets as	icy	wind	blew	at	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	cold	as	a	witch’s	teat	out	here,”	Barksdale	said	without	preamble.	“Have	the men	put	out	the	tents	and	heaters;	I	want	everyone	well	rested	when	we	jump off.	Your	supply	sergeants	can	work	with	Headquarters	Company	to	break	the tents	down	in	the	morning	after	the	combat	elements	jump	off.	Meet	me	in	the command	track	in	fifteen	minutes,	and	we’ll	brief	the	attack.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	returned	to	his	company	and	gave	the	necessary	orders.	The	men	weren’t happy	about	putting	up	tents	in	the	freezing	cold	and	dark,	but	they’d	be	even less	happy	about	sleeping	out	in	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	quickly	returned	to	the	command	tracks.	Three	armored	vehicles,	Vietnam-era	M-113’s,	had	been	lined	up	side	by	side,	with	tent	extensions	stretched	out	to form	a	relatively	sizeable	briefing	area.	The	whole	setup	could	be	rolled	out	in ten	minutes,	and	put	back	in	motion	again	in	five.	It	was	already	warming	up inside	when	Morris	entered	the	tent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Delveccio,	the	Delta	Company	commander,	was	already	there	when Morris	entered.	He	was	chewing	gum,	a	smug	look	on	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	Morris,	isn’t	your	girlfriend	in	2-432	Armor?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	what?”	His	heart	suddenly	pounded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know,	the	redhead	in	Newsweek?	West	Virginia	National	Guard	lady?	I wish	I	had	a	copy	of	the	article.	I	swear	she	was	in	2-432	armor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	is;	she’s	a	company	commander.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Delveccio	pointed	at	the	mapboard.	“Take	a	look,	Morris.	Fucking-A.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Colonel	Barksdale	spoke	in	a	commanding	tone.	“Captain	Delveccio.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p406"></a>Delveccio	straightened.	“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	me	a	favor	and	shut	up,	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barksdale	approached	Morris,	who	stood	over	the	map	table.	There	it	was,	as	he had	fully	expected.	The	map	showed	three	companies	of	tanks	and	infantry	in positions	near	Harpers	Ferry	and	Charles	Town,	from	2-432	Armor.	The	map didn’t	indicate	which	company	held	each	location,	but	Morris	knew	she	was there.	She	was	there,	all	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barksdale	spoke,	his	tone	low.	“Is	this	going	to	be	a	problem,	Morris?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	sir.	I’ve	got	a	job	to	do.	So	does	she.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pretty	sad	world,	isn’t	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	can	be,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	this	time	all	of	the	officers	were	present.	Barksdale	said,	“All	right,	everyone gather	around	the	map	board.	I’ll	make	this	short;	y’all	are	already	familiar	with the	operations	order,	just	a	couple	of	minor	changes.	We’re	approaching	from	the east	and	south,	right	here.	My	understanding	is	that	all	of	the	bridges	have	been dropped	except	for	this	one	at	U.S.	340.	The	scouts	will	approach	the	bridge	first with	a	sapper	team	and	attempt	to	disable	any	explosives.	In	the	event	the	bridge is	taken	out,	engineers	will	place	pontoon	bridges	just	to	the	west	right	here,	at the	top	of	the	rapids.	This	is	the	shallowest	point,	so	even	if	we	drop	a	tank	or Bradley	into	the	water,	it	should	be	able	to	get	out:	it’s	only	about	18	inches	deep there.	Everybody	got	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	officers	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,	the	bad	news.	We’re	expecting	a	really	bad	storm,	with	as	much	as	twelve inches	of	snow.	The	Maryland	Department	of	Transportation	has	extra	plows	and salt	trucks	deployed	to	ensure	this	highway	stays	open,	but	you	can	bet	that	there won’t	be	any	civilian	plows	out	in	Harpers	Ferry	tomorrow	morning.	Make	sure your	men	are	prepared	for	an	ugly	fight	in	the	snow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Delveccio,	the	pugnacious	captain	from	Delta	Company,	squinted	and	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p407"></a>“What	about	air	support?	Will	we	have	any	if	the	weather	is	that	bad?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Probably	not.	However,	the	area	will	be	thoroughly	prepped	with	artillery.	The first	fire	mission	is	scheduled	for	oh-three-hundred,	just	as	we	cross	the	line	of departure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	nodded.	It	would	still	be	dark	when	they	crossed	the	river. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Any	more	questions?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	if	we	don’t	have	air	support,	why	are	we	going	now?	Why	not	wait	until	it clears?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barksdale	looked	at	them	all,	his	eyes	jumping	from	one	officer	to	the	next. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	that	is	what	the	Commander-in-Chief	wants,	understand?	Those	are our	orders,	gentlemen.	We’re	going	into	combat	against	the	most	formidable opponent	this	unit	has	faced	in	many	years.	This	is	no	third	world	army	you	are fighting;	these	folks	trained	in	the	same	places	you	did,	served	in	the	same places	you	did,	and	at	least	some	of	them	are	combat	veterans.	I	expect	all	of	you to	take	good	care	of	your	men,	and	be	careful.	Be	very	careful.	Dismissed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowly,	the	officers	trailed	out	and	back	to	their	companies.	One	way	or	another, it	would	begin	tomorrow. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">January	2</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	leaned	against	the	side	of	the	turret,	her	helmet	providing	some	measure of	cushion	against	the	hard	steel.	The	hatches	were	closed,	but	still	her	breath appeared	before	her	in	crystals.	It	couldn’t	be	any	more	than	forty	degrees	inside the	tank.	Which	meant	it	was	a	hell	of	a	lot	colder	outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	at	her	watch:	0245.	They	should	get	the	word	to	move	any	time.	Her company	had	occupied	the	same	position	for	a	week,	making	a	nice	fat	target	for satellite	photos	and	reconnaissance	planes.	The	plan	was	to	move	to	their alternate	positions	as	soon	as	it	looked	like	the	enemy	was	on	the	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	loud	squeal	in	her	ear	signaled	an	incoming	radio	transmission. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bravo	Six,	this	is	Cornstalk	Six,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	switched	her	transmitter	to	the	battalion	net	and	keyed	her	helmet	forward	to the	radio	position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	Bravo	Six,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Intel	reports	movement	of	enemy	forces	west	on	U.S.	340.	You	will	occupy your	alternate	positions	immediately	and	prepare	for	enemy	assault,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roger,	Cornstalk	Six.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cornstalk	Six	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Well, </i>	she	thought.  <i class="calibre3">This	is	it.	No	turning	back	from	here. </i>	Keying	to	the	company net,	she	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	six	elements,	this	is	Bravo	Six,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	platoon	leaders	quickly	reported	in.	She	relayed	the	order	to	move.	No	need to	give	detailed	instructions;	they’d	rehearsed	this	maneuver	four	times	in	the last	week,	each	time	in	full	darkness.	The	ten	tanks	and	five	infantry	fighting</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p409"></a>vehicles,	plus	the	various	support	elements	including	maintenance,	medics	and fire	support,	all	started	their	engines	at	once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately	afterward	she	said,	“Hey,	Crump.	Can	you	turn	on	the	heater?	It’s freaking	cold	in	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	opened	her	hatch	and	a	pile	of	snow	fell	in	around	her;	then	she	stood	up, her	head	and	upper	body	outside	in	the	cold.	Even	with	the	night	vision	goggles, visibility	was	poor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	by	one,	the	tanks	and	Bradleys	backed	out	of	their	positions	and	drove	up the	fire	road	to	the	new	spots	they	would	be	occupying,	a	quarter	mile	away	and closer	to	the	river.	She	counted	them	as	they	passed:	two	platoons	of	four	tanks, one	platoon	of	infantry,	her	XO	Lieutenant	Britton,	then	the	fire	support	track and	the	medics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	she	watched,	Major	Elkins	called	over	the	battalion	net	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	six	elements,	this	is	Cornstalk	Six.	Intel	report:	the	artillery	units	to	the south	are	at	a	high	level	of	activity,	over.	Prepare	for	incoming	any	minute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cornstalk	Six	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">God	damn	it. </i>	Most	of	her	company	was	still	in	transit,	some	still	at	the	original position.	She	could	hear	the	tracks	clatter	against	the	pavement,	and	knew	the attackers	across	the	river	must	be	able	to	hear	it	as	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where	was	battalion	getting	the	information	anyway?	The	latest	intel	placed	the enemy	artillery	down	in	Loudon	County,	across	the	river.	They	must	have	a	spy, maybe	a	local	resident	calling	in	reports.	She	tapped	her	fingers	on	the	edge	of the	hatch,	waiting	as	the	last	vehicles	crossed	the	line	of	departure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	Crump,”	she	called	to	her	driver	over	the	intercom.	“Let’s	move	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back	up	slowly	please.	Now	pivot	right.	Good.	Do	you	see	the	track	ahead	of you?	Good,	follow	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	piercing	shriek	tore	the	sky	overhead	and	she	screamed.	“Incoming!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	dropped	down	into	her	hatch	and	pulled	it	closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	massive	explosion	two	hundred	yards	to	their	rear	threw	rocks	and	snow</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p410"></a>across	the	landscape,	followed	by	another.	Seconds	later	she	heard	her	executive officer,	Lieutenant	Britton,	reporting	to	the	battalion	they	were	taking	incoming artillery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	hit	was	close	enough	to	shake	the	sixty-ton	tank,	and	pepper	it	with shrapnel.	It	sounded	like	rocks	inside	a	tin	can. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Six	elements,”	she	called	over	the	company	net.	“Sitrep,	please.	Everyone intact?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	platoon	leaders	called	back	in.	No	one	hit,	so	far.	As	the	reports	came	in,	she heard	someone	whisper.	What	the	hell	was	that?	The	voice	was	hurried,	almost	a chant	or	a	prayer.	She	looked	around,	frantically.	Private	Haggett,	her	new loader,	sat	with	his	back	to	the	wall	of	the	turret,	his	mouth	steadily	moving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three	months	ago	Haggett	had	been	washing	dishes	at	Sally’s	Diner.	These	kids were	not	prepared	for	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Haggett,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	eyes	shifted	to	her.	“Yes,	ma’am?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	you	unkey	your	mike	while	you	pray?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	swallowed	and	nodded.	“Sorry,	ma’am.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Less	than	a	mile	away,	Morris	stared	at	the	ridge	across	from	him,	and	at	the	still untouched	bridge	into	the	town	of	Harpers	Ferry.	Looking	at	his	watch,	he frowned.	The	artillery	ripped	the	ridge	up,	the	big	rounds	crashing	into	the mountain	with	huge	explosions	that	echoed	off	the	ridgeline	behind	them.	He hoped	to	God	the	civilians	had	been	evacuated	from	the	area.	Even	as	he watched,	a	house	went	up	in	flames. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alpha	Six,	this	is	Arrow	Six,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	keyed	his	microphone	and	responded	to	Barksdale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	Alpha	Six,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p411"></a>“On	order	your	company	will	attack	across	the	bridge	toward	Bolivar	Heights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	you	reach	the	top	of	Bolivar	heights,	engage	and	destroy	the	enemy encamped	there.	Your	sector	of	fire	is	between	phase	lines	Brown	and	Hunt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Make	sure	your	units	don’t	fire	over	that	line;	Alpha	and	Delta	Teams	will	be	in echelon	to	your	flanks.	Do	you	copy,	over?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roger,	Arrow	Six.	Do	we	have	an	estimate	of	force	strength	on	the	hill,	over?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At	this	point	our	best	estimate	is	one	M1A1	tank	company,	reinforced	with mortars	and	one	platoon	of	infantry,	over.	We	flew	a	drone	over	there	a	while ago,	but	it	crashed.	The	weather.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">What	they	had	expected, </i>	he	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Arrow	Six,	this	is	Alpha	Six.	Any	air	support?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	have	no	air	support	at	this	time,	due	to	weather	conditions.	We’ll	continue with	the	artillery	until	two	minutes	before	you	launch	your	attack.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roger,	Arrow	Six.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Arrow	Six,	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	pulled	out	his	map	and	made	some	notations	in	it,	then	called	over	the company	radio	net.	“Alpha	elements,	this	is	Alpha	Six.	All	six	elements	and platoon	sergeants	report	to	my	vehicle	immediately.	Alpha	Six	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Climbing	down	out	of	the	turret,	he	signaled	to	Corporal	Porter,	his	radioman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,	Porter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	two	of	them	exited	the	back	of	the	Bradley	and	stood	on	the	ground.	Within a	few	minutes,	the	command	group	stood	around	him	in	a	loose	semicircle	and they	reviewed	the	plan	one	last	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	it,	folks.	Things	are	about	to	get	real	ugly.	Everything	goes	by	the	plan for	now,	keep	me	informed	as	you	advance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen’s	gunner	swept	the	turret	back	and	forth	across	the	area,	scanning	for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p412"></a>targets,	and	she	asked	herself	for	the	hundredth	time	if	she	had	made	a	huge mistake.	Maybe	she	should	have	just	turned	herself	in.  <i class="calibre3">No. </i>	Too	late	for	doubts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	better	or	worse,	she	had	a	job	to	do	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	clambered	back	into	the	cupola	and	looked	around	the	position	again	with her	night	vision	goggles,	mentally	reviewing	her	company’s	positions	for	the hundredth	time.	Two	tank	platoons	faced	the	main	approaches	across	the	river, both	platoons	dug	into	recently	excavated	berms	with	additional	cover	from nearby	houses	and	shops	rolling	down	the	slope.	Both	platoons	had	clear	fields of	view	of	the	hill,	however,	and	secondary	positions	were	prepared.	The	third platoon	was	dug	in	on	Cavalier	Heights,	kept	in	reserve	to	support	whichever area	was	attacked	in	force.	They	should	be	able	to	get	good	defilade	fire	on	the enemy.	Stretched	out	between	the	two	tank	platoons,	occupying	houses	and buildings	with	good	interlocking	fields	of	fire	was	the	attached	infantry	platoon, which	had	come	down	from	Wheeling.	Though	an	unknown,	the	infantry platoon	leader	and	sergeant	were	both	experienced	and	knew	their	stuff.	She would	have	to	hope	for	the	best.	Not	far	behind	the	reserve	platoon,	her	small mortar	section’s	personnel	carrier	sat	ready	to	fire	on	anyone	approaching	the hill.	It	wouldn’t	do	much	good	against	tanks,	but	would	be	very	effective	against the	Bradleys	parked	across	the	river. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More	on	her	mind	were	the	twelve	loaders	and	drivers	in	the	company	who	had enlisted	in	November	and	December.	None	of	them	had	enough	training	or experience,	but	the	slots	simply	had	to	be	filled.	One	of	the	new	privates	was seventeen;	he	hadn’t	even	graduated	high	school.  <i class="calibre3">What	the	hell	have	we	come	to,</i> <i class="calibre3">when	we	have	children	fighting	our	wars? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">A	call	came	in	over	the	radio:	the	second	platoon	leader. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain,	this	is	White	Six.	We’ve	got	movement;	they’re	getting	ready	to	cross the	bridge,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roger,	White	Six,”	she	replied,	lifting	her	night	vision	goggles	to	her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Britton	called	the	report	to	battalion	headquarters.	“Cornstalk	Six,	this	is	Bravo Five.	We	have	movement	across	the	river	at	this	time,	break.	Estimate	three companies	of	infantry	teams,	mixed	mounted	and	foot.	We	can	see	about	a	dozen tanks	in	three	groups,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roger,	Bravo.	Keep	your	people	prepared	to	execute	Clean	Sweep	on	order,	or</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p413"></a>on	your	judgment.	Cornstalk	Six	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	grunted.	Clean	Sweep	was	the	evacuation	plan.	The	idea	was	to	hurt	them, then	get	the	hell	away	before	they	could	hit	back.	Stop	somewhere	down	the road	and	hurt	them	again.	She	frowned	as	she	watched	the	infantry	battalion below	move	to	the	bridge.	The	first	two	tanks	were	pulling	out	on	the	bridge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	elements,	this	is	the	Captain.	We	are	at	weapons	hold	status	at	this	time.	I don’t	want	anyone	firing	prematurely.	We’re	going	to	let	most	of	the	infantry	get about	halfway	up	the	hill	before	we	do	anything.	We	want	them	out	in	the	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Acknowledge.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	the	platoon	leaders	acknowledged,	she	called	her	attached	infantry	platoon leader.	“Red	Six,	this	is	the	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Red	Six,	over,”	responded	the	infantry	platoon	leader. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take	out	the	bridge,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roger.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	waited	thirty	seconds,	and	nothing	happened.	The	tanks	were	halfway across,	and	the	explosives	they’d	planted	must	have	been	deactivated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain,	this	is	Red	Six.	It	looks	like	our	explosives	have	been	taken	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	hit	it	with	TOW	missiles.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seconds	later	there	was	a	bright	flash	and	explosion.	A	moment	later	one	of	the supports	crashed,	causing	one	side	of	the	bridge	to	sag.	One	of	the	attacking tanks,	an	M1A2	model	considerably	newer	than	hers,	went	down	into	the	river with	a	crash.	The	other	tank	was	already	across.	It	swung	its	turret	wildly, scanning	for	targets	as	it	backed	down	the	bank	toward	the	river	and	a	hide position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dropping	into	the	turret,	she	put	her	eyes	to	the	sight.	“Gunner,	sabot,	moving tank.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	crew	responded	rapidly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p414"></a>“Identified.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fire.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cannon	fired,	the	blast	pushing	the	cannon	a	foot	back	into	the	turret.	The shell	casing	flew	out	of	the	back	and	clattered	to	the	floor,	flooding	the	turret with	the	smell	of	ammonia.	The	sabot	round,	shining	bright	green	in	her	sights, flew	to	the	tank.	She	waited	a	second.	It	was	still	moving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	voice	loud	now,	she	called	out,	“Target,	reengage.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	saw	a	muzzle	flash	as	the	enemy	tank	fired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Identified.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haggett	struggled	with	the	heavy	120mm	round.	She	reached	across	the	turret and	helped	him	shove	it	in	the	tube.	A	moment	later,	his	face	flushed,	he	yelled, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Up,”	and	armed	the	cannon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fire.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cannon	bucked	again,	and	she	looked	through	the	site	and	felt	a	rush	of elation	as	the	turret	exploded,	showering	fire	and	shrapnel	across	the	river.	A moment	later	the	elation	was	gone,	washed	away,	as	it	hit	her	that	she	had	just killed	eight	Americans	in	those	two	tanks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seconds	later	the	center	section	of	the	bridge	collapsed	into	the	river	below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	radio	monitoring	the	battalion	net	spoke,	her	executive	officer	calling	to	the higher-up,	“Cornstalk	Six,	Bravo	Five,	over.	The	bridge	is	down.	Two	tanks engaged	and	destroyed,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	through	the	sights	at	the	thermal	images	of	the	approaching	infantry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	almost	in	the	kill	zone.	Behind	them,	engineer	vehicles	were	moving pontoon	bridges	into	place	across	the	river.	She	gave	the	order	to	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p415"></a>Murphy’s	hands	trembled	as	he	took	a	sip	from	his	coffee.	Major	Roth,	his operations	officer,	sat	across	the	map	table	from	him	as	they	listened	to	the reports	come	in	from	three	battlefields. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	north,	at	Harpers	Ferry,	infantry	units	from	Fort	Meade	were	attacking their	positions	at	U.S.	340	and	Route	9.	Additional	fights	were	occurring	on	the borders	with	Kentucky	and	Pennsylvania. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	flipped	open	his	phone	and	dialed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	voice	answered	at	the	other	end,	“This	is	the	governor’s	office.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	put	the	governor	on	the	line.	This	is	General	Murphy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	waited,	impatiently.	He	looked	at	his	watch.	Almost	0300. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	Slagter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Governor,	this	is	General	Murphy.	We’re	under	attack	at	this	time	on	three fronts.	The	fighting	has	just	started,	so	I	don’t	have	any	status	for	you	yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,	General.	I’ll	be	right	down	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shifting	position	inside	the	Bradley	fighting	vehicle,	Morris	switched	the	radio back	to	the	company	net. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alpha	elements,	this	is	Alpha	Six.	On	my	mark,	I	want	every	vehicle	to	fire	a TOW	missile	at	that	hill,	followed	by	chainguns.	Those	tanks	must	be suppressed	while	we	get	across	the	river.	Short	count	to	follow.	Five.	Four. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three.	Two.	One.	Fire.	Move	out,	move	out!	Get	across	the	river.	Alpha	Six out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ttwenty	wire-guided	missiles	raced	toward	the	summit	of	the	hill	as	the Bradleys	lurched	forward.	Morris	watched	them	go,	knowing	one	of	them	might well	be	aimed	at	Karen.	Was	she	up	there?	What	the	hell	were	they	doing?	It didn’t	matter	if	she	was	on	the	hill	or	not.	If	not,	she	was	somewhere	else	nearby, defending	against	one	of	the	other	attacks.	Like	it	or	not,	they	were	both	in	this battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p416"></a>“Sergeant	Harris,	what	you	got?”	Morris	asked,	watching	the	faint	contrail	of	the missile.	A	second	later	he	was	rewarded	by	half	a	dozen	explosions	on	the	hill	as the	missiles	found	their	marks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	I	can’t	tell	if	we	hit	anything.	The	tanks	backed	down	off	the	berm	as	soon as	we	fired.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	exploded?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Red,	White,	Blue,	this	is	Bravo	Six,	give	me	a	report,	over,”	Karen	shouted	into the	microphone	as	her	tank	moved	into	its	secondary	position.	Her	voice	shook, but	not	as	much	as	it	had	seconds	ago	when	the	missile	slammed	into	the	front	of their	turret,	throwing	the	tank	back	about	three	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bravo	Six,	White	Six,	no	damage,	repeat,	we	are	REDCON	one!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain,	this	is	Red	Six.	One-three	is	gone,	break.	Total	loss,	everyone’s	dead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	closed	her	eyes.	Four	people	dead,	at	least. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Blue	Six?”	she	called.	“Blue	Six,	this	is	the	Captain,	acknowledge,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain,	this	is	Blue	Four.	My	Six	element	is	dead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roger,	Blue	Four.	Take	command	of	the	platoon.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">SFC	Kathleen	O’Donnell	cheered	as	she	saw	the	tank	explode	at	the	top	of	the hill.	The	air	was	peppered	with	the	sound	of	heavy	small	arms	fire,	tank	cannons firing,	and	rockets	flying	over	their	heads.	She	could	smell	smoke,	black	and heavy	as	it	drifted	across	the	battlefield. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on.”	She	shouted	at	the	column	as	they	ran	past	a	burning	vehicle. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A	moment	later	she	frowned.	“Blue	Six?	Blue	Four.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	waited	again.	“Blue	Six?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Specialist	Conner	grimaced	beside	her	as	he	squatted	with	the	heavy	radio	on	his back	in	addition	to	his	rucksack.	“Sarge?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hold	on,	Conner,”	she	said,	and	held	her	hand	toward	him,	palm	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	headset	came	to	life	in	her	ear.	“Sergeant	O’Donnell?	This	is	Sergeant White.	The	LT	is	dead.	We’re	pinned	down	by	a	sniper,	over.	Son	of	a	bitch	took out	Ellers,	too,	and	we	got	a	couple	more	wounded,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roger,	White.	Can	you	make	out	the	location	of	the	sniper,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	in	that	office	building	up	the	hill,	on	Washington	Street.	It’s	the	only	big building	around,	we’re	out	in	the	open.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	voice	was	high-pitched,	almost	in	a	panic.	She	deliberately	slowed	down, spoke	in	a	calm	tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“White,	give	me	a	description	of	the	building,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	a	five	story,	up	the	hill.	It’s	higher	than	anything	else	around	here,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	see	it.	Wait	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Switch	me	to	the	company	net,”	she	yelled	at	Connors	as	she	fumbled	with	a map. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roger,	here	you	go.”	He	handed	her	a	microphone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain	Morris,	this	is	Sergeant	O’Donnell,	over.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p418"></a>“Alpha	Six,	my	six	element	is	dead,	repeat	my	six	element	is	dead.	His	section	is pinned	down	by	a	sniper.

<p class="calibre1">“Roger,	Blue	Six,	we’ll	get	it.	You	hold	on	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	she	dropped	the	handset,	bullets	slammed	into	a	car	parked	to	their	right	and they	all	dropped	to	the	ground.	The	windshield	shattered,	spraying	them	with fragments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Damn	it!”	she	shouted.	“Rudolph,	Sheehan,	get	your	machine	gun	team	on	that building	right	now.	We’ve	got	to	give	Alpha	section	some	cover.	Connors,	back to	the	platoon	net,	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Half	a	second	later	she	realized	Connor	was	lying	on	his	back	in	a	pool	of	blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Medic!”	she	screamed,	lurching	to	him.	A	piece	of	flying	glass	had	cut	his throat	wide	open	and	blood	poured	out	into	the	street,	staining	the	snow	black	in the	garish	streetlight.	Without	hesitation,	she	covered	his	throat	with	her	gloved hands,	the	blood	pouring	out	between	her	fingers,	steam	rising	into	the	freezing night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sarge,”	someone	screamed.	“McKinley’s	dead!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	closed	her	eyes.	McKinley	was	their	only	medic.	Connor	didn’t	have	any pulse,	and	there	wasn’t	a	thing	she	could	do	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stared	around	her	wildly,	losing	control.  <i class="calibre3">Goddamn	sniper. </i>	Jesus	Christ,	five people	down	in	two	minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sarge,	the	machine	guns	are	set!” </p>

<p class="calibre1">She	lifted	her	hands	from	Connor’s	neck	and	rolled	him	on	his	stomach, wrestling	the	radio	free.	Switching	to	the	platoon	net,	she	shouted,	“White,	I	got a	machine	gun	covering	you.	Move	out.	Get	past	that	building.	Get	some grenades	in	there	while	you	pass—see	if	you	can	set	the	damn	thing	on	fire!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On	the	way!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p419"></a>*</p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	elements,	this	is	Bravo	Six,”	Karen	called	into	her	radio.	“Execute	Clean Sweep,	I	repeat,	execute	Clean	Sweep.	Marching	order,	Blue,	Red,	White.	Move out	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	spoke	to	her	own	tank	crew	over	the	intercom.	“Back	up	and	pull	into	our hide	position.	Good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	reached	to	her	side	and	switched	the	radio	to	the	battalion	net	as	the	tank rolled	back	away	from	the	position	they	had	occupied	for	the	last	hour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cornstalk	Six,	this	is	Bravo	Six,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	Cornstalk	Six,”	Elkins	said	over	the	radio.	“Go	ahead,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	Bravo	Six.	We	are	evacuating	at	this	time,	over.	We’re	hurting,	over,	we lost	four	tanks	and	six	infantry,	over.	I’m	going	to	need	reinforcements,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roger,	Bravo	Six.	You’ve	done	an	outstanding	job.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	took	once	last	glance	at	Harpers	Ferry	as	they	sped	away.	The	snow	had increased	in	intensity,	almost	a	blizzard	now.	Half	a	dozen	buildings	were	in flames.	Behind	her,	the	U.S.	Army	would	was	occupying	the	positions	they’d just	vacated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’d	be	after	them	soon	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p420"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	Thirty-Seven</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">January	2</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Twelve	hours	had	passed	since	the	defenders	pulled	out;	the	snow	coming	down hard	enough	that	visibility	was	reduced	to	less	than	six	feet.	Morris	didn’t	care how	loud	the	President	and	senior	officers	crowed.	You	couldn’t	fight	a	war	in this	stuff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	the	same,	after	several	hours	of	waiting	and	regrouping	the	company,	they were	ready	to	move	out	in	pursuit	of	the	retreating	West	Virginia	forces.	He’d had	a	chance	to	review	their	positions.	It	was	a	good,	well-planned	defense, made	all	the	more	impressive	by	the	overwhelming	force	arrayed	against	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	looked	to	be	an	under-strength	tank	company	had	defended	against	an entire	battalion	here,	and	won	the	upper	hand.	Not	because	of	any	failure	on	his men’s	part,	but	because	the	politicians	ordered	them	to	jump	off	despite	the weather	and	the	lack	of	air	support.	He	had	a	dozen	dead	in	his	unit	because	of their	arrogance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	checked	the	bumper	number	of	the	damaged	and	destroyed	M1	tanks.	She wasn’t	there.	But	it	was	her	battalion	they’d	fought	here,	her	company,	even. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’d	been	part	of	it.	Now	twelve	of	his	men	were	dead.	He	tried	to	picture	her in	his	mind—the	woman	he’d	wanted	all	these	years,	the	woman	he’d	held	in arms,	what,	a	week	ago?	All	he	could	see	was	Lieutenant	Wingham,	his	brains and	blood	scattered	across	the	snow	by	the	shot	of	a	sniper.	He	had	work	to	do now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Six	elements,	this	is	Captain	Morris,”	he	called	over	the	radio.	“Prepare	to move	on	my	order.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	engines	in	the	remaining	Bradley	fighting	vehicles	and	one	tank	started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Move	out,	marching	order	Blue,	White,	Red.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	fell	in	behind	the	column	formed	by	Charlie	Company.	Morris’s	Alpha Company	had	been	the	hardest	hit	in	the	battle	at	Harpers	Ferry,	losing	a	dozen men.	Barksdale	had	placed	them	in	the	center	of	the	column	as	the	weakest point. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p421"></a>As	they	advanced,	plows	moved	ahead	of	them,	clearing	the	snow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	tank	was	still,	engine	off,	and	Karen	could	hear	her	ears	ringing	as	she looked	at	the	dark	landscape	through	the	commander’s	extension.	Below,	the thermal	sights	of	the	tank	clattered,	and	in	the	far	distance	she	could	hear artillery.	Someone	else	in	the	middle	of	a	fight,	somewhere	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain,	this	is	Red	Four.	I’ve	got	hot	spots	coming	over	the	ridgeline.	Looks like	our	folks	coming	down	the	highway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	call	came	over	the	landline,	a	wire	strung	from	tank	to	tank,	to	enable	the company	to	maintain	complete	radio	silence.	She	leaned	forward	and	traversed the	turret	to	the	right.	There	they	were:	scouts,	in	Bradleys	and	HUMMWVs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	would	let	the	scouts	pass,	wait	until	the	main	body	arrived	before engaging. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bravo	Company,	down	to	not	much	more	than	sixty	percent	strength	after	the morning	battle,	occupied	positions	to	the	right	of	Delta,	all	of	them	behind	the ridgeline	and	out	of	sight	of	the	road.	The	weather	had	taken	care	of	air observation;	no	one	could	fly	in	this	storm.	Even	if	they	could,	there	was	little	to see;	the	men	had	buried	the	tanks	under	a	foot	of	snow.	More	snowfall	had broken	the	uneven	lines,	making	them	nearly	invisible.	The	gunners	carefully cleared	away	spaces	in	front	of	the	primary	sights;	otherwise,	the	snow	served their	purpose	nicely,	camouflaging	the	thermal	signature	of	the	tanks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ahead	of	the	advancing	enemy	column,	Lieutenant	Antal’s	Alpha	Company arrayed	its	tanks	at	a	right	angle	to	her	and	Delta;	also	out	of	sight	of	the	road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Antal’s	company	had	fought	along	Old-Highway	340	from	Virginia	in	the morning,	losing	roughly	half	his	tanks.	The	battalion	had	linked	up	here,	where	it would	back	away	from	the	enemy	in	this	dangerous	cat-and-mouse	game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	opened	her	hatch	and	stood,	scanning	the	area	with	night	vision	goggles, then	toggled	her	radio.	“Everybody	track	a	target,	but	hold	your	fire.	We’ll	get the	word	from	higher	when	we’re	ready	to	go.	Let	the	scouts	go	by.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	dismal	day	was	turning	into	even	darker	twilight.	Mike	continued	to	scan</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p422"></a>with	his	binoculars	when	he	saw	a	glare.	It	looked	like	a	reflection.	Hard	to	see anything	in	all	this	snow,	but	he	scanned	again	and	saw	a	regular	shape:	a	black rectangle	on	its	side,	barely	visible	on	the	ridgeline.	It	was	the	primary	sight	of	a tank.	Panic	hit	him,	and	he	reached	for	the	radio. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Morris	moved,	a	green	star	cluster	exploded	in	the	sky	above	him.	He gripped	the	side	of	the	hatch	and	ducked	down	instinctively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	signal,	the	cannons	of	twenty-four	tanks	fired	at	once.	Morris	winced	at the	sudden	muzzle	flashes	and	concussions,	and	several	tanks	exploded	into flame	as	they	were	each	hit	by	two	or	more	rounds.	The	explosions	lit	the highway	and	surrounding	area	in	a	bright	red	light</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Blow	smoke!	All	elements,	dismount,	dismount!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	attack	shattered	the	column.	Ten	tanks	were	burning,	their	ammo	cooking off	and	throwing	shrapnel	and	dark	black	smoke	into	the	air.	It	looked	like Charlie	Company	had	been	wiped	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Each	of	Morris’s	Bradleys	launched	their	smoke	grenades,	blanketing	the	entire highway	in	thick	white	smoke	that	shielded	their	movements. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go,	go,	go!”	Morris’s	men	sprinted	down	the	ramps	of	their	vehicles,	each platoon	rushing	to	occupy	a	defensive	position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	jumped	out	of	his	vehicle	and	hit	the	ground	with	his	small	command	group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Bradleys	pulled	off	into	the	depression	in	the	center	of	the	road,	trying	to find	some	cover. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	tanks	behind	him	in	the	column	returned	fire,	the	cannons	throwing	up	great clouds	of	smoke	and	flame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	up	as	he	heard	a	sudden	ripping	sound,	as	if	someone	were	tearing	a thick	blanket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Incoming!”	He	tried	to	shrink	further	down	into	the	slush. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	first	dozen	artillery	shells	were	shot	out	of	the	air	by	a	truck	mounted	laser at	the	back	of	the	column,	bright	explosions	over	their	heads	illuminating	the area.	Then	laser	was	taken	out	by	a	tank	round,	and	the	artillery	came	in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p423"></a>undeterred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	first	shell	landed	amidst	the	Bradleys	with	a	giant	explosion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	screamed	into	the	radio,	“Everybody	off	the	road.	Maintain	your	sectors,	but expand	the	perimeter—I	don’t	want	anyone	in	the	open!	Report.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	platoon	leaders	reported	in,	and	he	crawled	through	the	slush	to	the	edge	of the	highway.	The	snow	and	ice	soaked	through	his	uniform.	He	glanced	back: not	everyone	in	the	command	group	was	off	the	road	yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,	get	off	the	road,	you’re	sitting	ducks	there!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	heard	a	high-pitched	crack,	and	another	tank	exploded,	and	another.	One	tank in	the	column,	surrounded	by	smoke,	swung	its	turret	as	it	looked	for	a	target. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Four	rounds	hit	it	at	once	with	a	tremendous	explosion,	throwing	the	turret	into the	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crawling	forward,	he	rolled	into	the	slush-and-mud-filled	ditch.	He	fumbled with	his	binoculars	and	scanned	the	ridgeline,	then	keyed	his	radio	and	called	his platoon	leaders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Give	me	a	report,	six	elements.	First	platoon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	heard	a	squeal	and	then	Kathleen	O’Donnell’s	voice.	“We’re	mostly	intact, sir,	I’ve	got	one	guy	with	pretty	bad	burns,	but	he’ll	live.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	your	position?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Left	side	of	the	road,	sir.	I’m	mixed	up	with	some	guys	from	Charlie	Company; they	can’t	find	any	of	their	officers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roger.	Keep	your	folks	low	and	in	the	ditch.	They’ll	be	coming	after	dismounts next.	Second	platoon,	report.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	heard	no	answer	except	the	cracking	of	tank	cannons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Second	platoon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still	no	answer.	“Damn	it.	O’Donnell?	Do	you	have	contact	with	second</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p424"></a>platoon?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	sir.	I	don’t	think	they	all	made	it	out	of	the	Bradleys,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Oh,	no. </i>	“Third	platoon,	report.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	this	is	Sergeant	Miller.	We’re	intact,	sir,	no	casualties	at	this	time,	I’ve	got	a good	base	of	fire	along	the	edge	of	the	woods	south	of	the	road,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	in	contact	with	second	platoon?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right.	You’ve	got	the	best	position	right	now.	I	want	you	to	send	a	squad	up the	ridge	right	now	with	all	the	anti-tank	weapons	you	have.	See	if	you	can	take out	some	of	those	tanks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir	I	have	to	advise	against	that,	at	least	until	we	get	better	control	of	the situation.	They	might	get	cut	off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through	the	smoke,	Morris	could	see	muzzle	flashes	from	tank	cannons	up	the hill.	They	were	cutting	his	company	to	pieces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sergeant,	we	won’t	get	better	control	unless	we	can	do	something	about	those tanks!	Get	them	on	the	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wilco,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	looked	at	his	command	group.	“Watson,	you	got	battalion	on	the	line yet?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right	here,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	reached	out	and	took	the	microphone,	winced	as	another	vehicle exploded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Colonel	Barksdale,	this	is	Captain	Morris.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	ahead,	Morris,	report.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	the	tanks	are	all	gone,	sir.	I’ve	got	one	platoon	on	the	edge	of	the	woods; </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p425"></a>they	are	sending	a	squad	up	the	ridge	with	anti-tank	guns.	I’ve	got	one	more platoon	in	the	ditch	at	the	side	of	the	road;	we’re	preparing	to	advance.	My second	platoon	is	gone,	sir,	out	of	touch.	I	don’t	know	if	they	made	it	out	of	the Bradleys	alive.	Sir,	we’re	facing	considerably	more	than	one	tank	company here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	son,	keep	it	calm.	Charlie	Company	has	been	torn	up	completely—I can’t	reach	any	of	their	officers.	If	you	find	any	of	their	men,	pull	them	in	under your	command.	Alpha	and	Delta	companies	were	cut	off	in	the	attack,	we’ll	try to	swing	them	around	in	a	flanking	attack.	Keep	your	squad	on	the	ridge	in touch;	I	don’t	want	any	friendly	fire.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Keep	me	informed,	Morris.	Barksdale	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morris	handed	the	microphone	back	and	heard	a	chilling	sound.	Machineguns—</p>
<p class="calibre1">lots	of	them.	The	enemy	had	finished	with	the	tanks	and	Bradleys,	and	was shifting	focus	to	the	dismounted	infantry.	The	rat-a-tat-tat	sound	of	machine guns	was	heard	all	up	and	down	the	line,	and	tracers	slammed	into	the	pavement behind	him.	The	sound	was	oddly	muffled	as	the	bullets	struck	mounds	of	snow and	ice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	keyed	the	radio	again.	“O’Donnell.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	want	you	to	see	if	you	can	extend	your	right	flank	and	envelop	most	of whatever	is	left	of	Charlie	Company.	We	need	to	get	some	control	over	there;	no one	can	reach	their	officers.	As	soon	as	you	have	done	so,	we	need	to	get	some anti-tank	mines	out	there,	otherwise	they’re	liable	to	come	rolling	in	on	top	of us.	And	get	your	men	into	the	trees,	if	they’re	not	already.	They’re	dead	if	they stay	in	the	open.	Got	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roger,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	top	of	the	ridgeline,	Karen	watched	through	the	thermal	sights	of	her	tank as	the	dismounts	scattered	below.	At	this	distance	it	was	impossible	to	maintain</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p426"></a>accurate	machinegun	fire;	they	were	well	outside	the	effective	range	of	the M240	machineguns.	However,	even	random	fire	from	two	companies	of	tanks—</p>
<p class="calibre1">each	tank	armed	with	multiple	machineguns—must	be	murderous	down	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Below	her,	in	the	gunner’s	seat,	Sergeant	Bowen	leaned	away	from	the	sights and	rested	his	head	against	the	side	of	the	turret.	“This	is	awful,	Captain.	Oh,	my God,	those	people	are	Americans.	We	might	even	know	some	of	them.	Oh, Christ.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know,	Sergeant,	I	know.	This	will	be	over	soon,	I	hope.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	this	time	the	battle	had	quieted	significantly.	In	the	valley,	fires	raged	as fourteen	tanks	and	a	dozen	Bradley	fighting	vehicles	burned.	None	of	the armored	vehicles	in	the	column	had	survived,	and	the	infantry	was	scattered	in pockets	and	ditches.	Slightly	to	the	rear	of	her	position,	her	fire	support	team dropped	mortars	at	the	direction	of	her	platoon	leaders,	but	it	was	impossible	to gauge	the	impact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	call	came	over	the	radio. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain	Greenfield,	this	is	Red	Six.	Spot	report,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	ahead,	Red	Six.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ma’am,	it	looks	like	they	are	trying	to	flank	us—we’ve	got	a	column	of	tanks coming	up	the	fire	trail,	looks	like	a	reinforced	company.	They’ve	got	a	bunch	of dismounts	with	them	as	well.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	good	work,	Red	Six,	wait	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	switched	the	dial	of	her	radio	to	the	battalion	net. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cornstalk	Six,	Cornstalk	Six,	this	is	Bravo	Six.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Major	Elkins	answered.	“Go	ahead,	Bravo	Six.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Spot	report.	I	have	a	column	of	tanks	and	infantry,	estimated	to	be	greater	than company	strength,	moving	up	the	eastern	fire	road	at	this	time.	I	have	a	defense prepared,	but	we	won’t	hold	them	long.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p427"></a>“Roger,	Bravo	Six.	Keep	me	updated.	I’ll	send	a	platoon	from	Delta	Company	to your	position	as	a	reserve	if	you	need	it.	Cornstalk	Six	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	switched	back	to	the	company	network.	“Red	Six,	Red	Six.	Shift	your platoon’s	sector	of	fire	to	their	alternate	positions	and	prepare	to	defend.	I	have an	additional	platoon	on	the	way	as	backup	for	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roger,	ma’am.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	moment	later	she	heard	the	first	anti-tank	mine	explode	to	her	right,	followed by	the	crack	of	tank	cannons	and	machine	guns.	That	was	followed	by	a	radio call	to	the	fire	support	vehicle,	calling	in	mortars	on	the	counterattacking	forces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	hands	twitched	as	she	peered	out	the	vision	block,	trying	to	see	what	was going	on	over	there.	Nothing	she	could	do	without	getting	in	the	way	at	this point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sergeant	Kevin	Miller	peered	up	the	hill,	desperately	trying	to	see	in	the	dark just	where	his	men	were.	He	had	two	squads	covering	the	edge	of	the	woods, most	of	them	sitting	in	a	cold,	wet	ditch.	The	ones	who	weren’t	in	the	ditch	were digging	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	third	squad	was	up	the	hill,	steadily	reporting	back	their	positions	as	they moved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	voice	over	the	radio	came	at	a	very	faint	whisper—it	was	the	squad	up	in	the woods.	“Sergeant	Miller,	can	you	hear	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	ahead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	infiltrated	their	position.	I	don’t	know	if	there	are	any	infantry	up	here, just	tanks	so	far.	I’ve	split	my	men	up,	we’re	going	to	try	to	disable	as	many	of the	tanks	as	we	can.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,	please	keep	me—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miller	never	finished	the	sentence.	A	random	bullet	from	one	of	the	tanks	hit him	in	the	face	and	knocked	him	backwards.	Blood	splashed	out	the	back	of	his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p428"></a>helmet	and	stained	the	snow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	shit,	Sarge!”	Corporal	Larry	Woods,	the	platoon	medic,	ran	over.	“Oh, shit!”	he	screamed	when	he	saw	the	damage.	“Sergeant	Miller’s	fucking	dead! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh	shit!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Woods,	panicked	now,	stood	up,	his	head	swinging	around	as	he	searched	for	a place	to	run. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	team	leaders	shouted,	“Get	down,	Woods!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	too	late.	Woods	was	hit	by	a	shell	fragment	and	fell	to	the	ground,	blood pouring	out	of	a	gash	in	his	side.	He	looked	down	at	his	side,	and	screamed	as steam	and	blood	poured	out	of	his	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	hundred	yards	away,	Kathleen	O’Donnell	was	focused	on	her	own	platoon’s problems.	She	had	managed	to	get	one	squad	to	the	edge	of	the	woods	before	the tanks	had	turned	their	attention	on	the	infantry,	but	the	other	two	squads	were still	in	the	ditch	beside	the	highway.	She	lay	on	her	back	in	the	ditch,	her	rifle across	her	chest,	calling	instructions	back	and	forth	to	Staff	Sergeant	Roy,	the third	squad	leader,	when	the	call	came	over	the	company	net. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain	Morris,	Captain	Morris,	this	is	Sergeant	Wilson.	My	six	element	is dead,	repeat,	Sergeant	Miller	is	dead,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roger,”	Morris	answered.	“Take	command	of	the	platoon,	please.	Remember you’ve	got	a	squad	up	this	hill,	maintain	contact	with	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">O’Donnell	closed	her	eyes.  <i class="calibre3">No</i>.	They	hadn’t	even	been	married	two	days	yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">PFC	Deena	Hall,	their	platoon’s	medic,	called	to	her,	“Sarge,	you	all	right? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sarge?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	yeah.	Just	keep	your	head	down,	all	right?	It’s	a	mess	out	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">O’Donnell	took	a	deep	breath.	Right	now,	here	and	now,	she	just	didn’t	have time	to	mourn.	Not	if	she	got	her	people	killed	because	she	was	too	busy thinking	about	herself.	All	the	same,	as	she	rolled	over	and	peered	over	the	edge</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p429"></a>of	the	ditch,	tears	streamed	down	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sergeant	Roy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yo!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here’s	what	we’re	going	to	do.	We	take	‘em	by	surprise.	We	all	storm	over	the edge	at	once,	and	run	like	hell	for	the	trees.	No	stragglers—no	goddamn stragglers,	because	if	they	stay	behind	they’ll	be	dead.	Understand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	got	it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right.	Everyone	listen	up.	When	I	say	go,	jump	to	your	feet	and	run	for	the treeline.	The	second	you	get	there,	dive,	get	under	whatever	cover	you	can	find. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Don’t	panic	and	don’t	stay	behind.	On	three.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	paused,	caught	her	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One.	Two.	Three!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	three,	she	jumped	to	her	feet	and	drove	them	like	pistons,	running	for	the edge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	machine	guns	rattled	and	red	tracers	pounded	into	the	snow	around	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	screamed	as	they	ran	for	the	woodline. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	step.	Two	Three.	She’d	made	twenty	yards,	when	she	heard	a	cry	behind her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	glance	back,	and	O’Donnell	slid	to	a	stop.	PFC	Hall	had	fallen,	her	aid	bag with	its	precious	bandages	strewn	across	the	wet	slush.	O’Donnell	ran	back	and pulled	her	to	her	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Run,	goddamn	it,	run!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hall	took	off	running.	O’Donnell	followed,	her	feet	slipping	in	the	wet	slush.	An arc	of	machine	gun	fire	tracers	pounded	into	the	ground	to	her	right,	then	moved in	her	direction.	She	shrieked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	bullet	knocked	her	off	her	feet,	shredding	her	knee	and	throwing	her	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p430"></a>ground.	She	stared	in	horror	as	blood	poured	out	of	her.	She	was	still	twenty yards	from	the	treeline. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go,	go,	go,”	she	shouted	until	she	saw	Hall	disappear	into	the	trees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">O’Donnell	glanced	down	at	her	knee.	She	couldn’t	feel	anything,	but	didn’t really	need	to	see	it	in	order	to	understand	how	serious	it	was.	Blood	soaked	into the	snow,	turning	it	black,	spreading.	Too	much	blood,	it	had	to	be	an	artery.	Oh God,	no. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	reached	to	her	left	shoulder,	where	her	individual	bandage	hung,	as	it	did	on all	the	troops.	Her	hands	shaking,	she	ripped	open	the	plastic	and	began	to	wrap it	around	her	knee.	It	wasn’t	enough.	She	needed	a	tourniquet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sarge!”	she	heard	someone	call.	O’Donnell	looked	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	was	crouched	beside	a	tree,	rifle	at	his	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	you	move?	You’ve	got	to	get	out	of	there,	Sarge!	I’m	coming!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	Stay	there,	I’ll	be	fine.”	She	struggled	to	stand,	and	then	fell	back	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	up,	saw	the	indecision	on	his	face,	then	shouted,	“No!”	as	he	slung the	rifle	over	his	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turville	ran	out	of	the	treeline.	His	mouth	was	open	and	he	shouted	as	he	ran, sliding	the	last	ten	feet	through	the	snow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,	Sarge,	we	got	to	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">O’Donnell	struggled	up,	and	a	flash	of	tracers	came	their	way	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	damn	it!	Go	back!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	bullet	struck	Turville	in	the	neck,	and	he	fell	to	the	ground.	Blood	showered out	of	the	hole	in	the	front	of	his	throat	as	he	screamed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	bullet	hit	O’Donnell,	this	one	dead	in	the	center	of	her	flack	vest.	It knocked	her	over	onto	Turville.	She	tried	to	pull	him	up,	but	her	knee	gave	out and	she	fell	down.	Blood	poured	out	of	her	and	all	over	the	no	longer	white</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p431"></a>snow,	and	she	realized	it	was	too	late. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	closed	her	eyes.	Kevin	was	dead,	a	hundred	meters	away.	What	would	their boys	do?	The	dark	sky	poured	snow	like	the	troubles	raining	on	Job,	and	she prayed	at	a	whisper,	tears	and	blood	running	freely	from	her	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	take	care	of	them,	Lord.	Please	see	my	sons	grow	up	to	be	strong	and good	men,	and	happy.”	She	sobbed.	“Let	them	be	happy—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	bullet	ended	her	prayer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	looked	at	the	carnage	on	the	highway	below	and	wondered	if	God	would ever	forgive	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	can’t	last	much	longer.”	Sergeant	Bowen’s	voice	was	framed	by	the	loud clattering	of	the	old	thermal	sights	of	the	tank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know.	As	soon	as	their	artillery	catches	up,	they’ll	kick	the	crap	out	of	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Good	thing	we	had	all	this	snow,	it’s	got	to	be	slowing	them	down.	I	don’t understand	why	they’re	attacking	without	any	air	support,	it	doesn’t	make	any sense.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	much	longer	before	we	evacuate?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	long.	The	whole	point	of	this	strategy	is	to	keep	them	blundering	into ambushes	as	we	back	up.	We’re	stalling	for	time,	I	think,	so	the	politicians	can sort	this	thing	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	won’t	be	able	to	stall	for	much	longer,”	he	said.	“Not	the	way	we’re	losing folks,	running	out	of	ammo.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">I	know	that</i>,	Sergeant.	As	soon	as	we	get	the	word,	we’ll	clear	out	of	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	didn’t	reply,	and	she	mentally	kicked	herself	for	snapping	at	him.	It	wasn’t his	fault. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	reached	up,	pulled	the	releases	on	her	hatch	and	popped	it	to	the	full	open position,	then	stood	up	and	stretched.	Outside,	she	could	hear	the	engines	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p432"></a>tanks,	tracks	creaking	on	the	ground,	and	the	occasional	burst	of	machinegun fire.	In	the	distance,	to	the	north,	there	were	large	flashes.	Another	battle,	by	the looks	of	it,	probably	somewhere	up	near	Shepardstown.	Another	bright	flash	in the	far	north,	and	it	suddenly	sank	in:	she	could	see.	Visibility	had	vastly improved.	Not	good.	She	looked	up	at	the	sky.	Still	heavy	clouds,	but	no	more snow,	and	in	a	spot	or	two,	she	could	see	stars.	With	the	weather	clearing	up,	it wouldn’t	be	long	before	air	support	appeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	as	the	realization	sank	in,	she	heard	a	squelch	over	the	radio,	then	Major Elkins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	elements,	this	is	Cornstalk	Six.	Prepare	to	move	out,	please	report	status.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	called	to	her	platoon	leaders,	even	though	she	knew	their	status	already.	A few	moments	later,	she	called	back	to	Elkins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cornstalk	Six,	this	is	Bravo	Six.	We	are	ready	to	roll,	except	for	one	disabled vehicle.	Some	dismounts	hit	one	of	my	second	platoon	tanks	with	a	grenade earlier	and	blew	off	a	sprocket.	They’re	not	going	anywhere,	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	Bravo	Six.	Have	the	crew	join	your	trains	and	blow	that	tank	in place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roger,	Cornstalk	Six.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	relayed	the	necessary	instructions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	bottom	of	the	ridgeline,	covered	in	frozen	mud,	his	fingers	too	stiff	to move,	Morris	heard	the	tanks	leaving.	The	tracks	rumbled	and	creaked	on	the ground	with	an	ominous	noise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everybody	stay	in	position	until	they	are	gone,”	he	called	over	the	radio.	“They may	have	left	behind	snipers.	Platoon	leaders,	get	me	a	count	of	your	dead	and wounded	so	I	can	call	in	a	medivac.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	fifteen	excruciating	minutes	Morris	waited,	until	the	last	of	the	sounds	were gone.	In	the	east,	the	sky	was	just	beginning	to	lighten.	He	tried	to	stand,	and found	he	couldn’t	move.	Slowly,	he	came	to	his	knees,	leaving	his	rifle	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p433"></a>snow;	he	couldn’t	grip	it	anyway.	Teeth	chattering,	he	bent	over,	pulled	his	rifle over	his	shoulder	and	finally	stood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	could	hear	helicopters	approach.	He	slowly	walked	back	to	the	highway, where	the	fifteen	Bradley	fighting	vehicles	of	his	company,	plus	two	tanks,	still burned.	Black	smoke	poured	from	the	vehicles,	and	they	still	radiated	a tremendous	amount	of	heat,	though	the	ammunition	had	long	since	cooked	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Near	the	second	platoon	vehicles,	he	could	see	several	bodies	on	the	ground,	all of	them	burned	beyond	recognition. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Dear	God.	Why	are	we	doing	this? </i>	What	the	hell	purpose	did	it	serve	to	invade immediately	instead	of	trying	to	negotiate?	Was	this	all	for	the	pride	of	a	few men?	What	the	hell	would	he	tell	the	children	and	families	of	the	dead?	What would	he	tell	the	Miller	kids? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sky	was	light	enough	now	to	see	his	platoons	at	the	treeline,	gathering	their dead	and	wounded.	They	were	exhausted,	frozen,	some	injured,	and	all	of	those left	had	watched	their	friends	and	teammates	cut	to	pieces	overnight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	up	as	the	helicopters	approached.	It	wasn’t	the	medivac:	eight	Apache helicopters,	armed	with	anti-tank	missiles,	raced	overhead,	no	more	than	forty feet	off	the	ground,	throwing	up	snow	in	their	rotor	wash	as	they	passed overhead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Too	bad	they	weren’t	here	twelve	hours	ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	time	for	this	to	end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">As	they	came	to	a	stop,	Karen	and	her	loader,	Haggett,	jumped	out	of	their hatches.	Sergeant	Bowen	had	traversed	the	turret	so	the	main	gun	pointed	to	the side.	She	climbed	off	the	turret	onto	the	back	deck	of	the	tank	and	began	to	work loose	the	cover	to	the	right	side	fuel	tank.	Haggett	did	the	same	on	the	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	moment	later	two	trucks	pulled	up	beside	them—on	the	left,	a	fuel	truck,	on the	right,	ammunition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haggett	and	Crump,	the	driver,	began	fueling	the	tank.	Karen	jumped	back	to	the turret	and	helped	Bowen	with	the	tank	rounds.	The	driver	of	the	ammunition</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p434"></a>truck	handed	the	rounds	off	to	her,	and	then	she	passed	them	down	to	Bowen, who	loaded	them	into	the	turret. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Twelve	rounds,	then	thirteen,	and	the	driver	said,	“That’s	it,	ma’am.	How	about small	arms?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bowen	looked	up	through	the	hatch.	“We’re	not	done	yet,	still	down	by	five rounds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	looked	at	the	driver,	who	shrugged.	“Orders,	ma’am—I	was	told	no	more than	thirteen	rounds	per	tank;	we’re	running	low	on	ammo.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	put	her	hands	on	her	hips	and	said,	“Who	gave	you	that	order?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Colonel	Elkins,	ma’am.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	whatever.	I’ll	talk	to	the	Colonel.	I’ll	need	two	cans	of	fifty-caliber. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sergeant	Bowen,	how	are	we	doing	on	7.62	rounds?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Need	about	two	thousand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ten	cases,”	she	said	to	the	driver. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	war	better	end	quick,”	Bowen	said.	“If	we	don’t	have	any	ammo,	we’re going	to	be	hurting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	looked	off,	down	the	valley,	and	squinted,	suddenly	alarmed.	What	the hell	was	that?	She	could	see	movement,	and	then	a	flash.	Probably	a	rocket launching.  <i class="calibre3">Helicopters</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bandits!	We	got	choppers	coming!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	leaned	down	beside	her	hatch	and	reached	in,	grabbed	the	microphone,	and screamed,	“Bandits!	Bandits!	Pop	smoke!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	truck	drivers,	panicked,	jumped	back	into	their	vehicles,	but	they	were	too late.	The	first	round	slammed	directly	into	the	front	slope	of	Karen’s	tank, throwing	the	entire	turret,	and	everyone	on	it,	into	the	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	saw	a	flash	of	white	below,	and	then	nothing	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p435"></a><b class="calibre4">Chapter	Thirty-Eight</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">January	3</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	before	sunrise,	Governor	Slagter	marched	into	Murphy’s	headquarters	with two	aides	in	tow.	Murphy’s	body	shook	from	fatigue	and	too	much	coffee.	He looked	at	the	governor,	his	glance	dismissive,	and	he	made	no	move	to	walk away	from	what	he	was	doing.	Slagter’s	clothes	were	rumpled,	as	if	he’d	slept	in them,	and	dark	circles	framed	his	eyes.	His	face	seemed	to	struggle	between irritation	and	anxiety,	and	he	opened	his	mouth	to	speak,	and	then	closed	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally	he	spoke,	his	voice	devoid	of	the	confidence	it	had	borne	in	their	earlier meetings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“General	Murphy,	where	do	we	stand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	gestured	to	the	table.	“Why	don’t	you	come	over	to	the	map,	sir,	and	I’ll show	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	governor	approached,	his	eyes	scanning	the	map	without	understanding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	pointed	as	he	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	the	north	sir,	we’ve	been	knocked	out	at	I-79:	first	brigade	is	out	of	the action,	most	of	the	men	dead	or	surrendered.	Here	along	the	340	extension,	we stopped	the	attack	in	place	overnight,	but	I	had	a	report	an	hour	ago	that	the battalion	there	was	under	air	attack.	I’ve	heard	nothing	since;	we	have	to presume	they	were	defeated.	In	the	south,	it’s	no	better.	We	were	wiped	out	at	I-66.	I	expect	the	war	will	be	over	sometime	this	morning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	explosion,	somewhere	outside,	rattled	the	windows,	and	the	lights	went	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	few	seconds,	the	lights	came	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	got	generators	in	the	building,	sir.	But	not	long	ago	they	started	hitting key	points	through	the	state	with	cruise	missiles:	bridges,	power	substations, telephone	exchanges.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	interrupted	as	Major	Roth,	the	operations	officer,	called	to	Murphy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks	like	they	just	took	down	the	Bureau	of	Mines	building,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p436"></a>Slagter	looked	at	him,	his	face	slack,	defeated.	When	he	spoke,	his	voice	was almost	at	a	whisper.	“Murphy,	how	could	it	be	over	so	quickly?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	stared	back.	“Governor,	I	told	you	over	and	over	we	can’t	win	this	on	a military	basis.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	governor’s	response	was	almost	a	whisper.	“I	counted	on	you	to	win	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	it’s	not	too	late	for	you	to	do	something.	We	can	probably	hold	on	for	a	few hours	yet—at	least	until	they	get	troops	into	Charleston.	Can’t	you	get	a	political settlement?	Of	some	kind?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter	shook	his	head.	“The	President	won’t	even	return	my	calls.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Try	again,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	building	shook	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	do	what	I	can,	Murphy.	I	would	never	have	guessed	it	could	end	this quickly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	grimaced.	“Sir,	you	should	be	grateful	they	didn’t	bomb	us	from	a distance	for	a	month	or	two	to	soften	us	up.	That	would	have	caused	massive civilian	casualties.	Someone	up	high	made	a	decision	to	put	their	soldiers	at	risk in	a	ground	assault	to	avoid	civilian	deaths.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter	turned	away,	hands	clasped	behind	his	back.	His	shoulders	rose	as	he took	a	deep	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	recommend?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	watched	the	governor,	almost	feeling	pity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	try	again.	Then—if	we	can’t	get	the	President	to	agree	to	anything—we surrender.	We	have	no	other	choice	at	this	point.	The	weather	is	clearing,	so	for sure,	sometime	today,	we’ll	have	air	assault	or	airborne	forces	dropping	into Charleston.	You	don’t	want	a	battle	in	the	streets.	The	civilian	casualties	would be	enormous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Surrender!	General,	how	can	you	seriously	advocate	surrender?	You	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p437"></a>would	both	be	tried	for	treason	and	likely	be	executed!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	shrugged.	“Better	that	than	killing	innocent	people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	believe	that	will	happen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Governor,	you	appointed	me	as	your	military	commander.  <i class="calibre3">Will	you	listen	to	my</i> <i class="calibre3">judgment	of	things	military,	just	once? </i>	I	am	telling	you	if	we	resist,	if	we	fight the	invading	troops	here	in	the	city,	we’ll	not	only	kill	a	lot	of	our	own	troops, and	theirs,	unnecessarily,	but	we	will	likely	be	responsible	for	the	deaths	of thousands	of	civilians.	That	is	not	an	option.	I	won’t	order	my	men	to	do	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	I’ll	fire	you	and	put	someone	else	in	charge.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who?	Colonel	Hatfield?	He’s	been	captured.	Colonel	Myers?	Missing	or	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	Major	Roth	over	here	will	accept	command.	It’s	irrelevant	at	this	point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ll	say	the	same	thing	to	you	I’ve	said	all	along,	governor.	There	is	no	military solution.	You	must	find	a	solution,	a	political	one,	and	quickly.	The	war	will	be over	in	a	matter	of	hours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slagter,	his	cheeks	twitching,	stared	at	Murphy	as	if	he’d	been	slapped.	Without another	word	he	turned	and	walked	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	pain	was	excruciating,	her	side	burning,	as	if	she	had	been	flayed	alive.	The searing	pain	went	down	to	her	hips	to	her	right	knee,	almost	driving	away conscious	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen	opened	her	eyes.	An	unfamiliar	medic	crouched	at	her	side,	a	young woman	in	her	twenties,	her	face	blurred	by	the	tears	that	flooded	Karen’s	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sun	was	high	above	the	medic’s	shoulder;	it	must	be	near	noon.	The	snow melted	around	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	tried	to	sit	up,	and	nearly	screamed	from	the	pain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	move,	Captain.	You’re	pretty	torn	up;	helicopters	are	on	the	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Karen’s	voice	was	gravel.	“What’s	happening?	Where	are	my	men?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p438"></a>“Calm	down,	Captain.	I	think	some	of	your	men	are	dead,	but	there’s	some survivors.	You’ll	be	taken	to	the	hospital.	I	don’t	know	after	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unbidden	tears	poured	from	her	eyes.	“What	unit	are	you	with?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	medic	looked	at	her,	incredible	sadness	in	her	eyes.	“First	of	the	Fifteenth Infantry,	Ma’am.	I	guess.	Not	too	many	of	us	left	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Panic	set	in,	and	Karen	lifted	her	upper	body,	despite	the	pain.	Her	voice	was hoarse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain	Morris?	Are	you	in	his	company?	Is	he	alive?	Is	he	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	medic	jerked	back,	surprised	an	enemy	prisoner	knew	her	commanding officer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I’ll	see	if	he’ll	talk	to	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	backed	away,	and	Karen	collapsed	backward,	lightheaded	and	shaking.	She must	have	lost	a	lot	of	blood.	She	couldn’t	tell,	couldn’t	lift	herself	enough	to	see her	own	body.	Above,	the	sky	was	clear	and	blue,	crisp	like	winter.	Her	eyes closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Boots	approached	in	the	crusted	snow,	and	a	shadow	fell	over	her.	Afraid	of what	she	would	see,	she	opened	her	eyes.	Morris	knelt	at	her	side,	his	face	black with	mud	and	dirt,	a	bandage	wrapped	around	his	left	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	it	over?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	her	question,	his	eyes	dropped	to	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	for	us.	They’ll	be	taking	you	to	the	hospital,	then	wherever	prisoners	are going.	I’m—I	don’t	know	where	I’m	going.	My	company	is	gone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	felt	her	whole	body	shake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sorry.	I	wish…”	She	couldn’t	articulate	what	her	heart	cried	out	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	eyes	blurred,	and	he	averted	them,	looking	away	to	the	woods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	do	I,”	he	whispered,	and	she	knew	his	love	had	become	nothing	more	than</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p439"></a>dust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	leaned	close	and	kissed	her	lightly	on	the	lips.	Then	he	stood,	and	without another	word,	walked	away	from	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	hours	after	sunrise,	the	reports	Murphy	expected	came	into	headquarters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hundreds	of	helicopters	had	crossed	the	Kentucky	border	near	Mingo	County. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Order	all	units	to	stand	down,”	he	told	Major	Roth.	“Issue	new	orders	to	all commands.	We	are	going	into	a	ceasefire,	effective	immediately.	The	rules	of engagement	will	be	simple:	avoid	contact.	Surrender	if	fired	upon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Roth,	his	face	drawn,	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.”	He	hurried	away	to	relay	the	orders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	stood	at	the	windows,	looked	out	at	the	snow-covered	city,	his	back	to the	officers	in	the	room.	This	time	last	year,	he	had	been	playing	in	the	snow with	Kenny.	They	had	gone	to	WalMart	and	bought	a	plastic	sled,	and	spent	the day	sledding	down	the	slope	near	the	house	until	they	were	both	soaking	wet, red	in	the	face,	laughing.	His	little	boy	would	never	have	understood	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	wasn’t	sure	he	understood	it.	Why	had	it	come	to	this?	Why	had	he	let	it continue?	Someone	else	could	have	taken	the	command.	Now	it	all	rested	on	his shoulders—all	that	pain	and	death	was	his	responsibility,	his	cross,	and	he	knew there	was	no	escaping,	no	walking	away	from	the	lives	he’d	wasted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Out	near	the	airport,	he	saw	hundreds	of	canopies	in	the	sky:	airborne	troops parachuting	in.	Must	be	the	82nd;	they	would	take	the	airport,	and	the	101st would	probably	secure	the	city.	On	another	day,	it	would	have	been	pretty;	from here,	the	parachute	canopies	looked	tiny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	building	shook	as	a	flight	of	Blackhawk	helicopters	flew	over.	Looked	like they	were	landing	in	front	of	the	State	Capitol.	Many	more	would	arrive	before	it was	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	waited.	It	wouldn’t	be	much	longer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p440"></a>When	it	came,	it	was	almost	an	anti-climax.	A	quiet	knock	on	the	door,	and Major	Roth	ducked	his	head	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,”	Roth	said	to	Murphy.	“The	enemy	commander	is	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	Major.”	Murphy	turned	away	from	the	window,	looked	at	the	young officer.	“Go	get	him,	bring	him	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Roth	saluted	and	left	the	room.	Murphy	turned	around,	looked	back	out	the window.	It	was	all	over.	In	an	incredibly	brief	time,	not	even	forty-eight	hours, all	of	West	Virginia’s	military	forces	had	simply	been	wiped	out.	Their	dreams for	independence,	their	dreams	for	a	country	with	the	freedom	of	his	childhood, were	swept	away.	Footsteps,	and	behind	him	the	door	opened.	He	turned,	and almost	broke	down	then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom	Murphy	stood	in	the	door	in	his	combat	gear,	a	pistol	in	a	shoulder	holster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several	other	officers	crowded	in	behind	him,	but	they	kept	their	distance	from Tom.	He	saluted	Murphy	formally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ken	returned	the	salute.	Tom’s	eyes	filled	with	tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“General,”	Tom	said,	struggling	to	keep	his	face	and	voice	under	control.	“My understanding	is	you	are	prepared	to	surrender	your	forces.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	is	correct.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	I	formally	accept	your	surrender	and	relieve	you	of	your	command,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom	turned	to	the	other	officers	who	had	crowded	into	the	room.	“Out.	Everyone leave.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	of	the	officers	backed	out	of	the	room,	except	for	Roth,	who	stayed,	his eyebrows	raised	in	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	nodded	to	Major	Roth.	“You	too,	Major.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Roth	backed	out	and	closed	the	door	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom	spoke	first.	“You	look	terrible.	Are	you	all	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p441"></a>“I	don’t	know.	It’s	been	quite	some	time	since	I’ve	slept;	I	could	use	a	rest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“General	Hayes	will	be	here	soon	to	arrest	you.	I’ll	probably	be	up	the	creek	for coming	ahead	of	him;	he’ll	want	the	glory	of	accepting	your	surrender.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	Tom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Was	it	worth	it?	All	this?	The	dead	troops?	The	war?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know.	It	all	depends	on	whether	or	not	our	country	wakes	up.	If	it	can somehow	turn	us	away	from	being	a	police	state,	then	yes,	it	was	worth	it.	Some things	are	worth	fighting	for.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom’s	face	twisted.	“Ken,	this	may	be	the	last	chance	I	ever	have	to	talk	to	you in	private.	They’re	going	to	hang	this	whole	war	on	your	shoulders.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	shrugged.	“Come	on,	little	brother.	I	love	my	country.	It’s	worth	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	it’s	not	about	whether	or	not	you	win,	but	whether	you	try.	Besides…</p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	nothing	left	to	lose.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom’s	face	contorted.	“There’s	always	something	to	lose.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	embraced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take	care	of	yourself,	Tommy.”	Murphy’s	voice	broke.	“And	please	watch	out for	my	little	girl.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom	nodded.	“I	will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eyes	red,	Tom	Murphy	backed	away	from	his	brother	and	wiped	his	face	with the	back	of	his	sleeve.	He	squared	his	shoulders,	tried	to	regain	his	composure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	a	Colonel	in	the	United	States	Army,	and	needed	to	look	the	part	as	they left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ken	Murphy	followed	his	brother	to	the	door	and	out	of	his	headquarters.	He took	one	short	glance	back	at	the	classroom,	which	had	been	his	headquarters	for these	brief	days,	and	then	turned	away.	It	was	time	to	meet	his	fate,	whatever that	would	be.	He	would	meet	it	head	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p442"></a><b class="calibre4">Epilogue</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">B</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">y	noon	on	January	4	the	war	in	West	Virginia	ended	with	the	surrender	of General	Kenneth	Murphy.	U.S.	Army	troops	occupied	Charleston,	and	by	the end	of	the	week	established	control	over	the	entire	state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	the	time	occupation	troops	arrived	at	the	Governor’s	Mansion,	it	was	too	late. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Frank	Slagter	had	shot	himself	in	the	head,	a	failed	suicide.	Rushed	to	the nearest	hospital,	he	never	recovered	from	the	gunshot	wound,	and	spent	the	short remainder	of	his	life	in	a	coma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	weeks	later,	sixteen	members	of	a	religious	community	in	Baughman Settlement,	West	Virginia,	were	convicted	of	the	bombings	in	Arlington,	Virginia and	Charleston,	West	Virginia.	The	jury	acquitted	them	of	the	charge	of	the murder	of	Dale	Whitt,	due	to	lack	of	evidence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	black	sedan	pulled	in	front	of	the	Miller	home	in	Gaithersburg,	Maryland late	in	the	day	on	January	5.	The	door	opened,	and	two	officers	stepped	out,	the first	a	youthful	captain	from	the	Chaplain’s	Corps,	the	second	a	grizzled	infantry sergeant	major. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	walked	up	the	immaculate	gravel	walkway.	The	sergeant	major	felt	a	pit	in his	stomach:	he	had	known	Kevin	Miller,	and	dreaded	giving	this	news	to	his family.	All	the	same,	he	squared	his	shoulders	and	rang	the	bell.	They	waited, and	then	heard	the	sound	of	running	feet.	The	door	opened,	and	a	little	boy looked	out.	He	looked	up	at	them,	then	ducked	back	inside	and	yelled</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Grandma,	the	Army’s	here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sergeant	major	clenched	his	fists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	opened	wide,	and	a	woman	stood	there.	She	was	a	beautiful	dark skinned	woman,	and	when	she	saw	them	standing	there	she	cried	out	and	her hands	flew	to	her	mouth.	Her	face	twisted. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p443"></a>At	the	sound	of	her	gasp,	a	grey	haired	man	ran	to	the	front	door.	His	eyes widened	when	he	saw	them,	and	he	pulled	the	woman	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr.	and	Mrs.	Miller?”	the	Chaplain	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	wailed,	already	knowing	what	she	was	going	to	hear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	regret	to	inform	you	that	your	son,	Sergeant	First	Class	Kevin	Miller,	was killed	in	action	yesterday.	I’m	afraid	we	don’t	have	any	details	as	to	the circumstances,	other	than	it	was	in	a	firefight	in	the	vicinity	of	Harpers	Ferry, West	Virginia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	the	woman	keened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	more	adults	came	to	the	door,	a	Caucasian	man	and	woman	in	their	sixties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	had	short-cropped,	grizzled	hair	and	a	neatly	trimmed	mustache.	They spoke	in	low	tones	with	Miller’s	parents,	and	the	sergeant	major	realized	they must	be	the	parents	of	Sergeant	First	Class	O’Donnell.	He	knew	Miller	and O’Donnell	had	just	married.	Someone	needed	to	see	about	getting	O’Donnell some	leave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	very	sorry	to	have	to	bring	you	this	news,”	the	chaplain	went	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anxiety	struck	the	sergeant	major	when	he	saw	another	sedan,	identical	to	his own,	coming	down	the	street.	What	were	the	chances?	It	pulled	up	behind	theirs, and	a	notification	team	got	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	God,	no,”	O’Donnell’s	father	cried.	“Not	my	little	girl.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	top	of	the	stairs,	two	boys	without	parents	looked	down	and	watched	their lives	fall	to	pieces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	first	thing	Jim	Turville	became	aware	of	was	the	feeling	of	something	rigid in	his	throat	and	the	awareness	he	was	unable	to	move	at	all.	With	that	little	bit of	information,	he	passed	back	into	unconsciousness	for	another	twenty-four hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	time	he	woke	up,	he	opened	his	eyes.	He	was	in	a	hospital;	that	much</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p444"></a>was	obvious.	His	head	was	immobilized	and	he	hurt	like	hell,	but	he	was	in	a hospital,	which	meant	he	was	alive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	alive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Karen	Greenfield	awoke,	she	was	disoriented.	Her	surroundings	were dark,	with	tiny	colored	lights	all	around.	She	couldn’t	move	her	body	or	her head,	had	difficulty	breathing.	She	felt	pain	everywhere,	a	dull,	throbbing	pain not	localized	to	any	single	part	of	her	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	all	right,”	said	a	voice.	“It’s	all	right.	You’ll	be	fine,	you’re	in	the	hospital.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	moved	her	eyes	around,	tried	to	focus	and	couldn’t	through	the	tears.	She was	alive.	Dear	God,	she	was	alive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	felt	a	hand	slip	over	hers,	then	a	brush,	a	light	touch	against	her	ear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	promised	I’d	find	you	when	it	was	over.	I’m	keeping	that	promise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Above	her,	she	saw	Morris’s	face.	She	sobbed.	Tears	rolled	out	of	her	eyes	and down	the	side	of	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wiped	them	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Larry	Harris	stood	in	front	of	the	desk	of	his	new	boss,	Morris	Klegg	.	They were	in	a	temporary	office—the	old	one	had	been	completely	destroyed	in	the fighting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Klegg	looked	at	him,	frowning.	“I	don’t	understand,”	he	said.	“You’ve	had	one hell	of	a	career.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harris	shrugged.	“I’m	done,	okay?	I	want	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At	least	explain	it	to	me.	Sit	down,	for	Christ’s	sake.	Is	this	about	Hagarty?	You know	there’s	nothing	more	you	could	have	done.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harris	collapsed	into	the	chair,	like	nothing	more	than	a	balloon	that	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p445"></a>pricked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	about	Hagarty.	It’s	the	whole	thing…	I	don’t	think	I’m	willing	to	do	this any	more.	We’ve	been	wrong	too	many	times.	It’s	one	thing	to	feel	like	we’re protecting	folks.	It’s	another	when	we	have	screwup	after	screwup	that	ends	up with	the	very	people	we’re	trying	to	defend	hating	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	our	fault,”	replied	Klegg. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No?	What	about	the	Saturn	plant	last	spring?	And	you	know	as	well	as	I	do	that Hagarty’s	death	would	never	have	happened	had	we	not	jumped	the	gun	and made	all	kinds	of	wrong	assumptions.	The	war,	for	God’s	sake—had	it	not	been for	our	screwups—it	wouldn’t	have	happened.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Klegg	closed	his	eyes	and	looked	down	at	his	desk.	His	face	worked	for	a moment,	as	if	he	were	angry.	After	ten	long	seconds,	he	looked	up.	“Look, Harris,	we	need	you.	Why	don’t	you	take	a	leave	of	absence	for	a	little	while,	get some	rest.	You’ll	be	good	as	new.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harris	shook	his	head,	then	reached	into	his	jacket.	Slowly,	he	pulled	out	his pistol	and	laid	it	on	the	desk,	followed	by	his	federal	credentials. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sorry,	sir.	That’s	almost	exactly	what	Hagarty	said	to	me	two	hours	before he	died.	I’m	done.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harris	stood	and	walked	out	of	the	office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	end	of	March,	three	court-martials	convened	and	occupied	the	news	for the	next	several	weeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	first,	of	Captain	Michael	Allen	Morris,	resulted	in	an	acquittal.	The	court-martial	board	ruled	that	he	was	not	responsible	for	the	death	of	a	civilian	minor in	Charleston,	West	Virginia,	in	October	the	previous	year.	All	charges	were dropped,	and	Morris	was	then	reassigned	to	the	Fourth	Brigade,	3rd	Infantry Division,	already	deployed	in	the	Middle	East.	Two	days	after	the	end	of	the court-martial,	he	flew	out	to	his	new	unit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Karen	Greenfield’s	trial	ended	three	days	later.	She	sat	stoic,	in	uniform</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p446"></a>throughout	the	trial,	but	obviously	still	in	considerable	pain	from	the	injuries which	had	kept	her	in	the	hospital	for	three	months. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	March	18,	the	jury	returned	a	verdict	of	guilty,	and	sentenced	her	to	seven years	imprisonment	at	the	U.S.	Army	Disciplinary	Barracks	at	Fort Leavenworth,	Kansas.	She	was	stripped	of	her	commission	as	an	officer	and reduced	to	the	rank	of	private,	to	be	followed	by	dishonorable	discharge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	March	21,	in	a	trial	that	was	surprisingly	quick,	General	Ken	Murphy	was convicted	of	treason. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bless	me	father,	for	I	have	sinned.	It	has	been	twenty-seven	years	since	my	last confession.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy’s	eyes	were	closed	as	he	kneeled	on	the	unyielding	concrete	floor.	It	was very	cold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	sins	are	these.	I	have	killed,	at	least	four	times	in	combat,	possibly	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	a	general	I	was	responsible	for	many	hundreds	of	deaths	of	innocent	people.	I have	committed	adultery.	I	have	lied.	I	have	had	false	pride,	which	led	me	to lead	others	into	danger.	I	did	not	educate	my	children	about	the	Church,	and	did not	teach	them	of	God.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	opened	his	eyes	and	looked	into	the	priest’s	eyes.	The	priest	was	around	his age,	balding,	in	his	black	suit	and	Roman	collar,	with	a	purple	stole	draped	over his	shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Father,	my	son	died	without	baptism,	and	did	not	receive	the	last	rites.	I	lost	my faith.	I	lost	my	wife.	Then	I	lost	my	soul.	I	don’t	even	know	if	it	makes	sense	to come	to	confession	now,	but…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	priest	spoke.	“Are	you	truly	penitent	for	your	sins?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	more,”	Murphy	whispered.	“I	have	wished	for	death,	father.	I	have	prayed and	prayed	I	would	die	and	could	rejoin	my	wife	and	son.	I	can’t	be	penitent	for that,	father;	I	can’t.	It’s	all	I	have	left.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	priest	sighed.	“God	will	understand,	my	son.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p447"></a>“Will	I	see	them	again,	father?	Do	you	really	believe	it?	Do	you	believe	I	will see	them	again	in	Heaven,	Father?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tears	rolled	from	Murphy’s	eyes	as	he	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	priest	put	his	hand	on	Murphy’s	shoulder	and	leaned	his	forehead	against him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	do,	my	son.	Pray	for	strength	during	your	ordeal.	Pray	your	sacrifices	will	not go	unanswered.	He	will	know,	my	son,	and	forgive	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	my	penitence?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	priest	grunted.	“You’ve	already	done	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	stood,	and	the	priest	knocked	on	the	steel	door.	It	opened,	and	he	stepped out.	Tom	Murphy,	now	wearing	the	single	star	of	a	Brigadier	General,	walked	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ken.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	embraced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	going	to	miss	you,	bro.	I	wish—I	wish	there	was	something	I	could	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	closed	his	eyes.	“There	is,	Tom.	Find	Valerie.	Find	out	what	they’ve done	with	her,	and	get	her	free.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom	nodded	his	head	and	stepped	back.	“I	will,	Ken.	I’ll	find	out	what	they	did with	her,	and	get	her	free,	if	it’s	the	last	thing	I	do.	I’ll	look	after	her,	and	make sure	she’s	safe.	I	promise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	don’t	stay,	Tom.	Don’t	watch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	the	only	family	you’ve	got.	I’m	not	leaving	your	side.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	do	this	to	yourself.	Go.	You	belong	among	the	living,	and	I	don’t.	Please, Tom.	Go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	embraced	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p448"></a>“I’d	give	anything	to	go	back	in	time	and	fix	it,	Ken,”	Tom	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	don’t	let	it	be	in	vain.	All	those	people	dead—make	it	matter.	Do	what	you can.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	love	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom	straightened	and	knocked	on	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	heavy	door	opened,	and	two	guards	entered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	done,	sir?”	one	asked	Tom.	“They’re	ready	for	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,”	whispered	Tom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guards	let	Murphy	out	of	the	cell,	and	down	the	hall.	Tom	followed	close behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bed	was	an	uncomfortable	looking	steel	device.	The	guards	led	him	to	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	clearly	tense,	possibly	expecting	a	fight.	Murphy	wasn’t	prepared	to give	them	one.	He	lay	down	on	the	bed.	He	glanced	over	at	his	brother	and	said goodbye.	Tom	shook	as	he	stood	there,	just	a	few	feet	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murphy	closed	his	eyes,	shut	out	the	steel	and	concrete	surroundings,	and	for	a moment,	he	could	see	a	beautiful	woman	standing,	hand	in	hand	with	a	little	boy, tears	in	their	eyes,	waving	for	him	to	come. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Martha.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">1. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	explosion	to	our	front_	throws	me	against	the	back	of	the	hatch,	pain shooting	up	my	side.	I	gasp,	dropping	the	belt	of	three-inch	long	bullets	to	the floor	of	the	turret.	They	land	with	a	loud	clatter	that	can	be	overheard	over	the whining	engines._</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I	stare	ahead	of	me	as	I	grab	another	belt	of	ammunition	and	load	my	machine</i> <i class="calibre3">gun,	chambering	the	first	round	with	a	loud	crack.	Men	are	running	from	a</i> <i class="calibre3">burning	truck,	scattering	in	all	directions.	One	screams.	He	is	on	fire,	and	I	pull</i> <i class="calibre3">the	trigger,	cutting	him	down.	I	smell	ammonia	and	gunpowder	rising	from	the</i> <i class="calibre3">turret	as	I	shift	my	fire	to	another	man,	also	running,	also	on	fire.	Sergeant	Arno,</i> <i class="calibre3">to	my	right,	is	firing	the	.50	cal,	the	machine	gun	chewing	into	the	side	of	the</i> <i class="calibre3">truck	on	the	left	with	a	bass	thud,	thud,	thud,	thud. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Moments	later	the	main	gun	on	‘33,	our	wing-man	tank,	fires,	a	white	flash</i> <i class="calibre3">across	the	landscape	followed	by	the	concussion,	and	a	running	man	is	cut	in</i> <i class="calibre3">half	by	the	heavy	tank	round.	Beyond,	as	they	fall	to	their	deaths,	the	horizon</i> <i class="calibre3">glows	a	dull	red,	a	black	moon-less	sky	washed	away	by	the	burning	complex</i> <i class="calibre3">ahead	of	us.	The	sight	of	my	machine	gun	is	centered	on	a	woman	who	stands,</i> <i class="calibre3">her	hands	clasped	to	her	chest.	Her	hair	flows	with	the	slight	breeze,	untouched</i> <i class="calibre3">by	the	smoke	surrounding	her,	and	her	eyes	are	focused	straight	at	me.	Against</i> <i class="calibre3">the	backdrop	of	the	flames,	I	can	see	her	clearly,	her	supplicating	expression,	a</i> <i class="calibre3">prayer,	perhaps,	on	her	lips. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I	grind	my	teeth	and	pull	the	trigger. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">2. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	jerk	awake,	heart	thumping,	surrounded	by	the	bright	cabin	of	an	airplane.	The engines	sound	so	much	like	the	turbines	of	a	tank	that	for	a	moment	I	feel	almost like	I’m	back	in	the	desert. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jesus,”	says	Steve	Hernandez,	sitting	next	to	me.	“You	all	right,	Chet?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shake	my	head.	“Fine,”	I	say,	responding	to	my	friend.	“Just	a	dream.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p451"></a>“Dream,	huh,”	he	replies	with	a	grin.	“I	hope	I’m	not	around	when	you	have	a nightmare.	What	were	you	dreaming	about?	Your	fiancé?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	moment	after	the	punch	line	he	hoots	with	laughter	and	punches	me	in	the shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Better	not	say	that	when	I’m	awake,	Steve.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Absolutely	no	sense	of	humor,”	he	notes.	“Speaking	of	future	wives,	did	I	show you	the	pictures	Paula	sent	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.	About	ten	times.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	not	enough	to	memorize	it,	Chet,	you	know	that.	Now	sit	up	and	pay attention.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	struggle	to	clear	my	head	and	wake	up.	He’s	holding	the	photograph	in	front	of me,	a	little	too	close. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anybody	ever	tells	you	familiarity	breeds	contempt?”	I	ask. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	And	in	this	case	it	would	do	the	opposite.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	think	I	spoiled	his	fun.	He	puts	the	photograph	away.	An	unused	writing	pad	is sitting	in	front	of	him,	pen	beside	it.	As	he	turns	back	to	the	paper,	rubbing	his hands	over	the	rough	stubble	on	his	chin	in	a	gesture	that	tells	me	he	is	thinking hard,	I	see	he	is	not	in	a	good	mood.	Steve	tends	to	joke	a	lot	more	when	he’s pissed	off	or	unhappy.	I	expect	its	because	he	won’t	be	able	to	get	to	California and	see	her	for	a	few	more	weeks.	I	only	have	to	drive	a	few	hours	to	get	to Atlanta	to	see	Amy,	but	Steve’s	got	no	such	luck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	guys!”	shouts	Sergeant	Arno,	approaching	from	the	front	of	the	cabin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	the	long	faces?	We’re	going	home!”	Our	platoon	Sergeant	is	smiling,	his tanned,	rounded	face	red	from	too	much	smoke	and	laughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	grunt,	and	Steve	says,	“Just	tired,	Sarge.	That,	and	I’ve	still	got	sixteen	months and	twelve	days	before	I	get	out	of	the	Army.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	you,	always	complaining	about	the	Army.	You	guys	got	to	cheer	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Check	out	the	stewardesses,	man!	I’ve	got	a	woman	at	home,	but	I	don’t	see	no</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p452"></a>wedding	rings	on	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Steve,	eyeing	an	exhausted	flight	attendant	who	is	sitting,	holding	her	head	in her	hands,	says,	“Sarge,	I’m	used	to	the	ladies	crying	 <i class="calibre3">after</i>	I	ask	them	out,	not before.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arno	chortles	and	slaps	Steve	on	the	back,	then	starts	to	turn	away.	“That’s	just all	the	smoke	in	her	eyes.	Time	for	you	guys	to	get	laid,	gentlemen.	You	need	to put	away	the	pens	and	paper	and	get	to	work	on	the	ladies.	After	a	year	in	hell I’d	guess	you’re	nearly	virgins	again.	You	guys	need	to	go	out,	get	some	drinks and	get	laid….	Oh,	shit!	I	forgot,	Brown,	you’re	not	old	enough	to	drink	yet!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	howls	with	laughter	and	walks	away,	and	I	feel	blood	rushing	to	my	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nearly,	my	ass,”	Steve	mutters	as	Arno	walks	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">3. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seat	belt	sign	just	came	on.	The	pitch	of	the	turbine	engines	changes	to	a	scream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	grind	out	my	cigarette.	I’m	awake	now,	but	still	a	little	shaken	up	by	the	dream</p>
<p class="calibre1">—the	dream	I’ve	had	every	night	for	a	month,	ever	since	that	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Craning	my	neck	to	look	out	the	window,	I	see	the	ground	rushing	toward	me, mottled	yellow	grass	and	concrete.	A	moment	later,	the	plane	touches	the	ground with	a	thud	and	a	screech	of	tires. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	soldiers	in	the	cabin	erupt	in	applause,	screaming,	waving	their	arms	in	the air.	Sergeant	Arno	grins	and	lights	a	cigar	as	a	stewardess	scolds	him.	He	grins and	ignores	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	stomach	is	twisting	as	the	plane	descends,	and	not	all	of	it	is	from	the descent	of	the	jet.	Coming	home	will	change	everything.	In	the	end,	though,	it doesn’t	matter.	All	that	matters	is	seeing	Amy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arno,	still	standing	near	the	front	of	the	cabin,	notices	me	looking	in	his direction	and	gives	a	jaunty	wave,	then	shouts	“Ufa!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Near	Arno	stands	another	stewardess,	looking	at	the	crowd.	Bone	thin,	possibly anorexic,	her	eyes	are	bright	with	tears	of	joy,	watching	the	troops	return	home safe.	The	soldiers	are	cheering,	some	screaming	rebel	yells.	More	than	a	few	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p453"></a>the	soldiers	on	the	flight	have	tears	in	their	eyes	after	landing	on	American	soil after	all	this	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	don’t	know	why	she’s	crying,	been	a	pretty	short	trip	for	her.	Must	be	all	the smoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Steve	Hernandez’	eyes	are	red	as	he	stuffs	his	crumbling	paperback	into	his	olive CVC	bag.	As	usual,	he	looks	as	if	he	needs	a	shave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	reach	under	my	seat	to	grab	my	rifle	and	protective	mask,	and	then	take	out	my forty-five.	I	pull	back	the	slide	and	look	in	the	chamber	to	make	sure	it’s	not loaded,	check	the	serial	number,	then	strap	it	into	the	holster	on	my	right	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	made	us	put	the	weapons	under	the	seats.	Made	the	cabin	crew	nervous, having	a	planeload	of	armed	passengers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	as	nervous	as	it	made	me,	and	I	know	these	guys.	A	soldier	in	the	82nd Airborne	Division	nearly	shot	another	guy	in	the	market	at	Khobar	this	week. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Forgot	to	clear	his	weapon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside	the	tiny	oval	window,	there	are	several	large	hangars,	and	a	fence keeping	out	a	huge	crowd	of	civilians	who	are	waving	American	flags.	Children, parents,	wives,	wearing	bright	clothes	and	looking	happy;	all	jumping	up	and down	and	screaming	and	crying.	I	doubt	any	of	my	family	is	here.	Like	my fiancée,	my	mother	did	not	approve	of	my	decision	to	enlist	in	the	Army.	Unlike Amy,	she	had	damn	good	reason	to	disapprove.	She	had	to	raise	me	alone.	My father	never	came	home	from	Vietnam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next	to	him	is	the	chemical	sergeant,	doing	the	same	with	the	protective	masks.	I turn	in	my	M16	rifle,	then	hesitate	a	moment	before	giving	up	my	forty-five pistol	and	gas	mask.	Feels	funny	turning	them	in.	The	smells	are	all	different here,	and	getting	on	the	bus	without	my	mask	and	weapons	takes	an	act	of courage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	hours	later	I	am	in	a	rented	car	on	my	way	to	Atlanta. </p>
<p class="calibre1">4. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	highway	from	Savannah	to	Macon	is	a	desolate,	150	mile	stretch	of	Georgia road	with	only	half	a	dozen	exits	spread	far	apart	from	each	other.	I	drive,	the trees	racing	by	on	either	side	of	the	highway,	still	a	long	way	from	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p454"></a>She	wasn’t	there.	Maybe	she	just	didn’t	know—it	can’t	be	that	easy	to	get information	from	the	Army. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	other	hand,	all	those	other	people	knew,	and	Amy	is	listed	as	the beneficiary	of	my	life	insurance,	so	the	Army	sure	as	hell	knows	her	address	and phone	number.	It	doesn’t	matter—I’ll	see	her	tonight	when	I	get	in.	I	tried	to	call from	Fort	Stewart,	but	I	got	her	answering	machine.	Didn’t	bother	to	leave	a message—I	hate	those	machines,	and	besides,	it’ll	be	a	surprise	when	I	get	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	last	letter	Amy	sent	me	came	only	two	days	ago	while	we	were	staying	in Khobar	Towers	in	Dhahran,	a	complex	of	high-rise	apartments	the	Saudis	built years	ago	but	never	occupied.	They	were	a	damn	sight	better	than	the	dirt	we slept	on	at	the	cement	plant	when	we	first	arrived.  <i class="calibre3">That</i>	was	a	hell	of	a	note. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	our	plane	first	arrived	in	Saudi	Arabia,	it	was	110	degrees	outside,	just past	midnight.	We	were	moved	in	buses	to	the	cement	plant,	where	we	had	to	put up	tents	before	we	could	go	to	sleep.	The	next	week	seemed	like	hell.	We	trained at	night	and	tried	to	sleep	in	the	daytime	heat,	bathing	in	strange-smelling	oily water	that	came	from	rusted	factory	faucets	and	drinking	gallons	of	water	every day	just	to	keep	from	dehydrating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	contrary,	Khobar	Towers	in	Dhahran	was	a	completely	different experience.	Though	the	apartments	were	unfurnished,	it	was	the	first	time	in many	months	we	had	slept	with	a	roof	over	our	heads,	or	had	a	shower,	or	a	real bathroom.	After	the	letter	came	I	sat	locked	in	the	latrine	for	an	hour,	reading	it over	several	times,	until	the	banging	on	the	door	got	too	loud	and	I	let	someone else	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	drive,	I	think	of	the	letter,	and	of	Amy.	I	re-read	the	letter	about	fifty	times on	the	plane	coming	home;	savoring	it,	learning	every	phrase,	every	note,	trying to	imagine	her	voice	behind	the	words.	I	know	it	by	heart	now.	It	was	written almost	a	month	ago,	just	after	we	invaded	Iraq. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Dear	Chet, </i>	it	read.  <i class="calibre3">The	news	told	us	last	night	that	the	ground	war	has	begun,</i> <i class="calibre3">that	you	have	begun	your	attack	into	Kuwait. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Paul	called	me	and	told	me	yesterday	evening,	then	he	came	over	and	we	sat	and</i> <i class="calibre3">watched	CNN	together,	much	as	we	have	done	most	nights	since	this	started.	It</i> <i class="calibre3">seems	as	if	it	has	been	an	eternity	since	you	left	for	Saudi	Arabia,	and	now,	it</i> <i class="calibre3">appears	that	the	final	stage	has	begun.	I	pray	that	it	will	be	over	soon. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p455"></a> <i class="calibre3">I	sat	up	all	night	staring	at	the	engagement	ring	you	gave	me	a	year	and	a	half</i> <i class="calibre3">ago,	expecting	that	we	would	be	married	by	now,	sharing	our	lives	by	now.	It	is</i> <i class="calibre3">terrifying	to	me	to	think	of	how	quickly	things	change,	how	quickly	our	lives</i> <i class="calibre3">have	been	turned	upside	down.	I	hope	you	know	how	much	I	love	you,	how	much</i> <i class="calibre3">you	mean	to	me.	All	the	time	we	were	together,	through	high	school	and	our	first</i> <i class="calibre3">year	of	college,	there	were	so	many	times	I	don’t	think	I	could	have	survived	had</i> <i class="calibre3">you	not	been	there	for	me.	And	no	matter	what	happens,	Chet,	I	will	never	forget</i> <i class="calibre3">that.	Every	time	I	see	the	news	now,	every	time	I	think	of	your	father	not	coming</i> <i class="calibre3">home	from	Vietnam,	I	am	terrified	for	you.	Sometimes	I	cry	hysterically	for	no</i> <i class="calibre3">reason,	at	school	and	the	other	day	at	my	job. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I	shouldn’t	be	writing	about	this	right	now.	You	have	far	too	much	to	worry	about</i> <i class="calibre3">now	without	worrying	about	me,	and	my	problems	must	seem	minor	by</i> <i class="calibre3">comparison.	Just	know	that	when	you	come	home,	we	will	have	much	to	talk</i> <i class="calibre3">about.	And	you	will	come	home.	There	is	no	doubt	in	my	mind	about	that,	you</i> <i class="calibre3">still	have	far	too	much	life	ahead	of	you	to	end	it	now.	Please	be	careful	and</i> <i class="calibre3">come	home. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Paul	says	hi,	and	he	apologizes	for	not	writing.	You	know	how	he	is	about	that. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Please	take	care	of	yourself,	Chet,	and	we	will	see	you	home	soon.	I	love	you. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Amy. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Thinking	about	her	makes	me	want	to	cry.	God,	I	miss	her.	I	haven’t	heard	her laugh	in	a	year,	I	haven’t	seen	her	eyes	in	a	year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	guess	a	little	longer	than	that,	really.	I	hurt	her,	badly,	when	I	decided	to	leave for	the	Army,	and	our	last	few	weeks	together	were	punctuated	with	anger	and uncomfortable	silences,	a	gap	that	I	am	praying	we	can	cross	now.	I	only	hope	I can	make	her	understand	why	I	had	to	do	it,	why	I	had	to	join	the	Army. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	only	I	could	understand	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	had	the	argument	again	and	again,	and	though	she	seemed	to	understand after	a	while,	I	never	fully	had	her	support.	Not	for	joining	the	Army,	of	all things.	I	was	alone	among	my	friends	in	my	belief	in	my	country	and	what	it stands	for.	And	none	of	them,	except	maybe	Julie,	understood	what	my	missing father	meant	to	me.	I	always	thought	I	could	make	Amy	understand—she	lost her	father	when	she	was	only	ten.	But	she	never	did	understand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Paul	and	I	would	argue	about	it,	too.	He	kept	telling	me,	over	and	over	again, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p456"></a>that	to	him	the	Army	was	the	opposite	of	everything	we	believed.	But	that wasn’t	true	for	me.	I	did	believe.	I	believed	in	the	principles	my	country	was founded	for,	and	one	of	those	principles	meant	standing	up	to	defend	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	do	I	still	believe?	After	I’ve	seen	what	war	is?	After	what	I	saw	and	did	in Iraq? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	don’t	know	what	I	believe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">5. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There.	The	skyline	of	Atlanta	grows	visible	ahead	of	me	in	the	darkness,	slender towers	rising	high	above	the	surrounding	landscape.	The	faint	glow	in	the	sky from	the	city	below	seems	alien	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	am	still	wearing	my	desert	uniform—by	the	time	I	made	it	to	the	bank, withdrew	enough	money	for	a	deposit	on	a	rental	car,	and	finished	dealing	with the	idiots	in	the	rental	agency	in	Hinesville,	all	of	the	stores	in	town	had	closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	won’t	last—I	bet	before	long,	with	all	the	soldiers	coming	back	to	Fort Stewart,	even	the	pawnshops	will	be	open	all	night.	Unfortunately,	none	of	the clothes	I	owned	before	I	joined	the	Army	fit	me	anymore—I	gained	forty	pounds in	basic	training	last	year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	traffic’s	getting	to	be	a	bitch	as	I	drive	deeper	into	the	city.	Strange	driving this	tiny	little	car,	I	keep	overreacting,	jerking	all	over	the	road.	My	heart	pounds as	I	see	small	cars	weaving	through	traffic	going	ninety	miles	an	hour.	It’d	be just	my	luck	to	make	it	through	the	war	okay	only	to	get	killed	on	the	interstate in	my	home	town. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	breath	a	sigh	of	relief	when	I	get	off	the	highway	in	Buckhead.	I	wonder	if	I should	have	called	first.	I	know	my	mother	didn’t	expect	me	home	this	early—</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	only	left	Iraq	to	return	to	Saudi	Arabia	two	weeks	ago.	Not	really	in	the mood	to	deal	with	her	yet,	anyway.	Maybe	she	won’t	be	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	moments	later	I	pull	up	to	her	apartment,	and	my	hope	is	realized:	the windows	are	all	dark,	empty	looking.	All	the	same,	I	pull	the	car	into	a	parking place	and	shut	it	off,	then	turn	off	the	lights.	She	moved	here	only	a	few	weeks after	I	graduated	high	school,	forced	out	of	the	midtown	apartment	by	rising rents.	This	apartment	was	only	half	home	to	me—I	spent	far	more	time	in	Amy’s cramped	apartment	than	I	ever	did	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p457"></a>I	stifle	a	yawn.	It’s	been	a	long	drive	getting	here.	Stepping	out	of	the	car,	I stretch,	then	light	a	cigarette.	I	walk	toward	the	front	door	and	knock.	No answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	more	try.	Still	no	answer.	If	she’s	drinking	again	she	might	be	passed	out.	I slam	my	fist	into	the	door	a	few	times.	Nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	get	back	in	the	car	and	drive	away.	Pulling	up	to	the	corner,	I	slam	on	the brakes	as	a	car	runs	through	a	red	light	in	the	intersection	in	front	of	me.	Jesus Christ.	If	I’d	been	through	there	twenty	seconds	earlier	the	bastard	would	have killed	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Double	checking,	I	pull	out	into	the	intersection	and	cross	the	street	to	the	gas station.	There’s	a	pay	phone	at	the	corner	of	the	parking	lot	next	to	the	street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pulling	up	to	the	phone,	I	jump	out	of	the	car,	drop	a	quarter	in	and	dial	Amy’s number	from	memory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	let	it	ring	five	times,	then	the	answering	machine	picks	up.	“Hi,	you’ve	reached Amy	Harris.	I	can’t	come	to	the	phone	right	now….” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	start	shaking	when	I	hear	her	voice,	then	hang	up	the	phone	and	turn	away.	I’ll drive	to	her	place	and	wait	until	she	gets	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Driving	south	on	Peachtree	Street	into	Midtown,	I	stare	around	with	distaste	at the	familiar	sights	of	my	life,	some	of	them	oddly	changed,	as	if	this	isn’t	quite the	place	I	grew	up,	but	a	near	twin.	Two	new	buildings	stand	in	the	skyline	of Midtown,	higher	than	any	of	the	old	ones.	The	breakfast	place	we	used	to	go	in the	middle	of	the	night	has	burned	down,	only	a	blackened	husk	remaining.	A new	twenty-story	building	stands	on	the	vacant	lot	where	Paul	and	I	fixed	his	car one	afternoon,	years	ago.	They’ve	added	peaches	to	the	license	plates,	but	it looks	like	the	maniacs	behind	the	wheel	haven’t	changed	any. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	few	minutes	I	turn	down	Fourteenth	Street,	take	a	quick	left	onto Crescent	and	I	am	in	front	of	Amy’s	building.	She	lives	in	a	tiny	studio apartment	here,	which	she	has	managed	to	make	look	cheerful	despite	its	size and	location.	Halfway	down	the	block	is	Rafael’s,	the	cafe	and	bar	where	we used	to	spend	much	of	our	time.	As	I	park	the	car,	I	see	hers	in	the	customary spot. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p458"></a>Relief	floods	through	me	when	I	see	the	car.	After	turning	mine	off,	I	sit	behind the	wheel	for	a	moment	to	catch	my	breath.	Thank	God	she’s	here.	I	don’t	think	I realized	until	just	this	moment	just	how	much	I	need	to	see	her.	I	can	almost	feel her	now,	feel	what	her	skin	will	be	like	to	touch,	almost	see	her	eyes	staring	back at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	get	out	of	the	car	and	lock	the	door	behind	me,	then	walk	down	the	cracked sidewalk	to	the	open	front	door	of	her	building.	Smells	like	urine	and	spilled beer	in	here,	and	the	light	is	burned	out.	I	never	did	understand	how	she	made the	place	seem	so	beautiful	inside,	with	the	rest	of	the	building	looking	like	a crack	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Up	the	stairs,	two	doors	down	on	the	right.	As	I	approach	the	door,	I	can	see	blue light	from	a	television	dimly	shining	through	the	crack	under	the	door.	She’s home.	Thank	God	she’s	home.	Across	the	hall,	a	television	is	turned	up	loud,	the noise	clear	in	the	hallway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	heart	beating	a	thousand	times	a	minute,	breathing	heavily,	I	knock	on	the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knock	again,	louder	this	time,	and	my	heart	rate	doubles	when	I	hear	the floorboards	creak	as	she	walks	to	the	door	and	opens	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	it	is	Paul	standing	there,	his	black	hair	loose	around	his	shoulders,	hanging over	a	white	terry	bathrobe	with	the	words	“Destin	Beach	Motel”	embroidered on	the	right	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	bathrobe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	eyes	narrow,	and	I	look	past	him.	She	is	approaching	the	door,	shock	evident in	her	eyes.	A	sheet	is	wrapped	around	her.	Her	face	is	flushed,	flushed	red	in	the cheeks,	just	as	I	remember	it	always	was	after	making	love. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No.	No	fucking	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Chet?”	she	asks,	pathetically,	her	eyes	suddenly	watering.	My	eyes automatically	dart	to	her	left	hand,	looking	for	the	ring. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p459"></a>She’s	not	wearing	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	breath	escapes	in	a	rush.	I	start	shaking	my	head,	back	and	forth,	and	clench my	fists,	then	open	my	mouth	to	speak.	For	a	moment	it	is	all	here	at	once	–</p>
<p class="calibre1">falling	in	love,	saying	goodbye,	the	burning,	killing	those	people	in	Iraq.	It’s	all right	here	smothering	my	mind	and	my	heart,	ready	to	snuff	me	out,	ready	to explode,	and	I	am	too	paralyzed	to	even	speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	nothing	comes	out,	I	turn	around	and	run. </p>
