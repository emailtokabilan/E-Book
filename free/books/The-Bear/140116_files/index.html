<p class="calibre1"><a id="p2"></a>The	Bear</p>
<p class="calibre1">By	Michael	E.	Shea</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	air	exploded	in	a	flash	of	bone	and	steel	and	blood.	The	clash	of	metal	rang through	the	forest.	An	arrow	pierced	through	the	darkness,	its	barbed	head tearing	through	flesh	and	muscle.	A	roar	echoed	off	of	the	mountains	far	to	the west.	A	cry	broke	through	soon	after.	Then	silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Char	stood	over	a	pile	of	black	fur	and	red	blood.	He	held	a	curved	sword, jagged	half	way	down	the	wide	blade	and	hilted	in	bone.	He	held	a	large	thick bow	in	the	other.	Lorfel	and	Ranur	stood	behind	him,	panting.	Lorfel,	a	short man	of	twenty	six	held	a	large	axe	in	both	hands	and	still	prepared	to	swing	it hard.	Ranur,	the	largest	of	the	three	held	a	pike	in	one	hand,	its	tip	hanging	low towards	the	ground.	He	buried	his	other	hand	in	his	gray	tunic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	it	get	either	of	you?”	Char’s	voice	rasped	low	in	the	silence	of	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No”	Lorfel	said.	He	planted	his	axe	head	on	the	ground	with	a	thud	and	leaned on	the	tall	handle.	There	was	a	pause.	Char	turned	towards	Ranur. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	hurt?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mm…My	hand.”	Ranur	took	his	hand	out	of	his	tunic.	Moonlight	gleamed	red off	of	the	ragged	wound.	Char	thought	he	saw	a	glimmer	of	bone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	he	claw	you	or	bite	you?”	Char’s	voice	held	an	urgency	that	set	both	Lorfel and	Ranur	on	edge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ranur	paused	and	then	spoke	low.	“He	bit	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Char	picked	Lorfel	and	Ranur	as	his	hunting	partners	for	their	speed	and sharpness	in	battle.	They	had	hunted	beasts	of	the	deep	woods	all	of	their	lives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	hunted	the	beasts	that	hunted	men.	They	all	knew	the	risks	of	battling	such creatures.	The	old	man	dropped	his	curved	sword,	drew	his	bow,	and	fired.	The arrow	hammered	into	Ranur’s	chest,	burying	itself	in	his	heart.	Lorfel	saw	the gleaming	arrow	head	sticking	almost	a	foot	out	of	his	companion’s	back.	Ranur fell	face	first	to	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p3"></a>Char’s	eyes	locked	onto	Lorfel.	The	old	man	expected	the	shock	in	Lorfel’s	eyes at	the	death	of	their	friend.	Yet	Char	saw	something	else	in	the	man’s	eyes; something	he	did	not	recognize.	Char	narrowed	his	eyes.	Lorfel	kept	his	gaze	on the	old	man,	not	looking	down	or	away.	Char	lowered	his	bow	and	turned	toward the	massive	black-furred	body	on	the	ground	and	then	realized	what	he	had missed.	Lorfel’s	leg	was	bleeding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	delay	was	the	chance	Lorfel	needed.	Lorfel	hurled	the	axe	underhand	from its	rested	position.	It	soared	towards	Char’s	head.	The	old	man,	seeing	the movement	in	the	corner	of	his	eyes,	tilted	back	as	the	massive	blade	of	the	axe cut	across.	The	blade	missed	him	by	four	inches	but	the	handle	hit	him	solid	in the	side	of	the	head.	Blackness	closed	in	as	he	reached	for	another	arrow.	Lorfel was	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lorfel	ran	south	throughout	the	night	and	half	way	into	the	next	day.	Char	had hunted	these	beasts	for	forty	years	and	Lorfel	had	no	doubt	that	the	old	man would	find	him	if	he	didn’t	move	fast.	The	wound	in	his	leg	throbbed	but	he	ran anyway.	At	the	midday	sun	Lorfel	stopped.	He	itched	all	over.	Lorfel	pulled	back the	hasty	bandage	he	had	wrapped	around	his	leg	earlier	and	saw	the	severity	of the	wound.	Lorfel	had	pulled	his	leg	up	just	as	the	beast’s	jaw	clamped	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	tooth	dragged	a	line	across	his	left	calf.	Now	the	wound	was	black.	Dark veins	spidered	across	his	lower	leg.	The	blood	around	the	wound	felt	thick	and sticky	like	syrup.	Dark	hair	sprouted	on	his	arms,	chest,	and	legs	in	alarming rates.	His	muscles	ached	horribly.	Five	hours	later	in	the	last	conscious	thought Lorfel	ever	had,	he	wished	Char	had	fired	that	arrow	into	him.	Two	weeks	later, his	muscles	torn	and	rebuilt,	his	bones	crushed	and	reformed,	Lorfel	wished	for nothing	but	blood.	1</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dark	clouds	covered	the	moonlit	sky	over	the	town	of	Relis.	The	steady	fall	of rain	turned	the	ground	into	a	sea	of	mud.	Crashes	of	thunder	echoed	over	the	tree tops. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jonse	ran.	A	tree	splintered	and	exploded	behind	him.	Vibrations	sent	puddles	of water	into	spasms.	The	crack	of	thunder	shot	new	bolts	of	electricity	through Jonse’s	nerves.	He	expected	a	huge	claw	to	slash	down	on	his	shoulder	any second.	Jonse’s	legs	pumped,	narrowly	avoiding	the	roots	and	stones	that promised	to	send	him	to	his	death.	His	lungs	were	about	to	explode.	He	wished he	had	never	come	out	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p4"></a>Each	thudding	of	the	beasts	huge	paws	sounded	closer	and	closer.	Jonse	didn’t dare	turn	and	look	behind	him.	He	had	seen	enough	when	he	stumbled	upon	it	as he	tracked	through	the	forest.	He	had	seen	just	enough	of	the	creature	to	know	it was	not	any	normal	beast	of	these	woods.	He	had	seen	enough	to	know	it	was nothing	he	ever	wanted	to	see	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	hours	ago	Jonse	had	been	safe	in	his	warm,	dry	home.	Safe,	but	not	happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	argued	with	his	father	over	his	plans	for	the	next	few	days.	For	months now,	Jonse	had	planned	a	trip	to	Whalesong	with	his	friends.	They	threw	angry words	at	eachother	for	nearly	an	hour.	In	the	end,	Jonse	slammed	out	of	his home,	his	blood	boiling.	He	needed	to	cool	off	and	the	woods	outside	of	Ralis was	just	the	place	for	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	rain	didn’t	stop	Jonse	as	he	headed	east	into	the	woods.	He	dreamed	of leaving	the	stables,	leaving	his	family,	and	heading	off	on	an	adventure.	He could	go	to	the	King’s	city	and	see	the	sites	few	of	his	village	ever	saw.	When his	mind	returned	to	the	present,	he	didn’t	recognize	his	surroundings.	The	rain fell	harder.	A	knot	tightened	in	Jonse’s	stomach.	A	cold	sweat	broke	out	on	his brow.	He	climbed	over	a	fallen	tree	and	pushed	through	a	large	brush. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he	saw	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gleaming	red	eyes	almost	ten	feet	off	of	the	ground	burned	into	him.	A	mouth opened	showing	huge	white	teeth	dripping	with	streams	of	saliva	that	bent	in	the wind.	A	flash	of	lightning	contrasted	the	beast	against	the	night	sky.	It	was	huge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jonse	felt	a	deep	rumble	as	the	creature	growled.	He	ran. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Air	burst	in	and	out	of	his	mouth	in	furious	gasps.	His	body	wanted	to	collapse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	ran	almost	a	mile	before	it	hit	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jonse	heard	the	sound	of	tearing	cloth	and	felt	himself	pushed	forward.	He	fell	to his	face	in	the	mud	but	was	back	up	in	a	second.	His	back	was	cold.	His	legs were	numb.	His	left	arm	wouldn’t	move.	Adrenaline	and	shock	kept	him	from realizing	that	the	beast	had	torn	off	almost	all	of	the	skin	and	half	the	muscle	in his	back.	He	ran	twenty	more	yards	before	falling	again.	Mud	filled	the	massive wound	in	his	back.	He	was	very	cold.	Jonse	closed	his	eyes	like	a	child, imagining	that	what	he	could	not	see	could	not	hurt	him.	For	a	moment	it seemed	to	work.	He	opened	his	eyes	in	time	to	see	a	flash	of	long	white	claws	in an	explosion	of	lighting.	He	saw	nothing	more.	2</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p5"></a>Longhorn	stood	with	his	hands	tucked	into	his	loose	leather	belt.	He	looked through	his	open	window	and	over	the	small	town	of	Relis.	Forty	families, mostly	farmers	and	tradesmen,	lived	in	the	village.	A	small	dirt	road	cut	across the	town,	separating	the	tavern,	church,	and	stables	from	the	blacksmith,	general goods,	and	the	sheriff’s	office.	A	series	of	farms	surrounded	the	town	in	three layers	of	a	circle,	each	with	a	small	home	and	often	a	larger	barn.	Relis	had supported	the	townsfolk	for	six	generations	and	most,	if	not	all,	of	the	villagers loved	the	town. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn’s	office	held	only	a	large	oak	desk,	chair,	and	a	tall	locked	cabinet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn	found	it	comfortable	enough.	A	door	in	the	back	of	the	office	led	to	a larger	room	with	a	bed,	oven,	three	chairs	and	a	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sheriff	sat	in	his	large	chair,	tipped	back	on	its	rear	legs,	and	put	his	feet	up on	his	desk.	He	stretched	his	arms	behind	his	back	and	clasped	his	hands	behind his	head.	He	took	in	a	large	breath,	let	it	out	slowly,	and	closed	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	wooden	door	burst	open	with	a	crash	that	almost	sent	Longhorn	head	first over	the	back	of	his	tilting	chair.	It	was	Carson,	the	town’s	unofficial	messenger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	boy	was	fifteen	years	old	and	took	it	as	his	personal	mission	to	inform everyone	in	the	town	of	every	piece	of	gossip	he	knew.	For	most	of	the	town folk,	Carson	was	a	great	annoyance,	resembling	a	mosquito	buzzing	close	but never	landing	on	a	sleeping	man’s	ear.	Longhorn	considered	the	boy	a	necessity for	one	reason:	no	one	else	seemed	to	want	to	talk	to	the	new	sheriff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Fickleson	boy	is	dead!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn	dragged	his	feet	off	of	his	desk	and	set	his	chair	back	onto	all	four	legs before	doing	anything	else.	He	believed	in	taking	everything	one	step	at	a	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	this	circumstance,	not	falling	over	backwards	and	cracking	his	skull	open	was more	important	than	understanding	Carson’s	shriek.	All	four	posts	firmly	planted on	the	floor	and	his	own	boots	flat	on	their	soles,	Longhorn	took	a	moment	to reorient	himself	with	the	boy’s	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who’s	dead?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	horseman,	Fickleson.	His	boy,	Jonse,	is	dead!”	Carson	still	hadn’t	lowered his	voice	and	Longhorn	patted	his	hand	down	in	the	air	and	clenched	his	eyes shut.	The	boy	understood	and	his	next	words	were	far	more	soothing	to Longhorn’s	ears	even	if	what	he	said	was	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p6"></a>“They	found	Jonse	out	in	the	woods.	He	ran	off	last	night	and	they	didn’t	find him	until	this	morning.	He’s	all	cut	up,	Sheriff.	They	said	his	head	was	stuffed way	down	into	his	chest	and	his	guts	were	all	strung	out	in	the	trees!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn	felt	a	small	burst	of	pride	when	the	boy	called	him	Sheriff,	but	the severity	of	the	situation	pushed	it	aside.	Few	others	in	the	town,	when	they bothered	to	acknowledge	him	at	all,	called	him	Sheriff.	Most	didn’t	speak	to	him at	all.	They	preferred	his	predecessor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn	moved	here	a	year	earlier	when	he	heard	the	small	village	needed	a new	sheriff.	The	previous	sheriff,	a	massive	man	known	as	Bron	Greentree,	had been	a	hero	to	the	town.	He	apparently	routed	a	gang	of	brigands	who	used	the town	for	smuggling	and	slave-trading.	Greentree	had	been	sheriff	for	almost	fifty years.	Even	if	he	had	spent	most	of	those	fifty	years	drinking	free	ale	at	the town’s	only	tavern	and	most	likely	skimming	off	of	the	taxes	he	collected	for	the King,	Greentree	was	the	town’s	hero. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	day	Greentree	fell	over	dead	in	his	office.	There	was	never	any	explanation but	his	massive	size	came	with	a	massive	appetite	and	many	felt,	though	few ever	spoke	this	out	loud,	that	his	heart	simply	could	not	keep	up	with	his stomach.	The	town’s	hero	had	died	and	the	town	sent	a	message	to	the	King’s city	with	the	news.	Longhorn	had	been	the	response. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	twenty	years	Longhorn	had	served	in	the	King’s	army.	He	fought	in	two wars	and	was	promoted	once	in	each	war.	He	once	led	two	hundred	men	against an	equal	number	of	southern	barbarians	and	lost	only	six	men.	The	Voth barbarians	lost	sixty.	He	served	as	commander	of	the	watch	for	ten	years.	On	his forty	fifth	birthday,	Longhorn	decided	it	was	time	to	retire.	When	the	message came	that	Relis	needed	a	new	sheriff,	he	jumped	at	the	chance.	Longhorn	figured that	keeping	peace	in	a	town	of	forty	families	was	easier	than	leading	an	army against	the	hoards	of	the	south. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn	was	right.	Keeping	the	peace	in	Relis	was	easy.	Surviving	the	sheer boredom	was	not.	Every	one	of	the	few	conversations	Longhorn	had	with	one	of the	townsfolk	included	mention	of	the	previous	sheriff.	Everyone	who	entered his	office	gave	him	a	critical	look	before	a	single	word	had	yet	passed.	Every whisper	he	overheard	as	he	walked	down	the	town’s	single	dirt	road	spoke Greentree	just	loud	enough	for	him	to	hear.	All	Longhorn	could	hope	was	that they	could	not	mourn	the	hero	of	Relis	forever.	There	were	more	important</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a>things	than	vanity,	however.	Longhorn	had	a	job	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	is	the	body?”	Longhorn	fixed	his	brown	eyes	on	Carson.	Carson	stepped back,	seeing	a	fire	there	few	in	the	town	had	ever	seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Out	north.	On	the	trail	to	Ralthorp’s	farm	about	half	a	mile	and	then	into	the woods	near	the	river.”	Longhorn	strapped	on	his	wide	leather	belt	hanging	the longsword	he	carried	low	on	his	left	hip.	He	pulled	his	blue	cloak	off	of	the	wall peg	and	wrapped	it	around	his	shoulders.	Longhorn	put	his	hand	on	the	boy’s shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Show	me.”	3</p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn	had	seen	death	before.	Longhorn	had	seen	a	hoard	of	two	hundred men	torn	to	shreds	by	musket	fire.	He	had	watched	angry	survivors	of	a	battle stab	wounded	children	on	the	battle	field	with	bayonets.	In	all	of	his	years, however,	Longhorn	had	never	seen	anything	like	this	before.	As	determined	has he	was	to	show	his	worth	to	the	town,	Longhorn	knew	this	situation	was	over	his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carson	had	exaggerated	in	his	description	of	the	wounds,	but	not	by	much.	The boy’s	head	wasn’t	smashed	down	into	his	chest,	but	it	was	torn	almost completely	off	and	twisted	a	full	turn	around.	His	intestines	weren’t	draped	from the	trees	but	about	half	of	them	were	in	a	pile	ten	feet	away	and	the	rest	of	them were	missing.	His	belly	had	been	ripped	open.	His	back	was	slashed	down	to	the bone	in	four	huge	gashes.	One	of	his	legs	was	gone.	Both	of	his	arms	were broken.	In	fifty	years,	Longhorn	had	never	seen	such	a	death.	He	could	only hope	the	boy	wasn’t	awake	for	most	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	of	the	village’s	farmers	were	there.	Lornhorn	approached	Rogard Greyfellow,	a	woodsman	who	lived	next	to	the	Ralthorp	farm.	He	held	a	huge axe	over	one	shoulder	with	his	arm	casually	draped	over	its	long	wooden	handle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	gave	Longhorn	that	same	critical	look	the	sheriff	grew	used	to	receiving	and then	looked	back	at	the	ruined	boy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	never	seen	anything	like	this.”	The	large	man	scratched	his	thick	black beard.	“Some	sort	of	beast	got	to	him,	I	suppose.	A	wolf	most	likely.	Greentree used	to	talk	about	the	danger	of	the	wolves	in	the	deep	woods.”	Longhorn	let	the statement	slide	but	he	knew	it	wasn’t	a	wolf.	No	wolf	had	claws	that	could	make a	wound	like	the	one	in	the	boy’s	back.	No	wolf	could	break	through	the	trees</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>that	hung	like	an	archway	leading	to	this	spot.	Longhorn	just	nodded	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wasn’t	sure	what	to	do	but	agitating	the	townsfolk	wasn’t	going	to	help.	It was	obvious	from	Rogard’s	tone	that	the	woodsman	didn’t	much	believe	his	own theory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn	looked	to	the	stamped	path	that	led	to	this	spot.	It	came	from	deeper into	the	woods.	Trees,	some	large	and	alive,	lay	splintered	to	the	side.	Longhorn walked	a	little	ways	down	this	path	and	found	one	of	the	beast’s	paw	prints.	It was	almost	ten	inches	across.	The	claws	had	dug	holes	in	the	earth	so	deep	that Longhorn’s	finger	couldn’t	find	the	bottom.	Longhorn’s	mind	began	reciting what	he	would	tell	the	parents	but	beyond	that	he	didn’t	know	what	to	do	next. </p>
<p class="calibre1">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;	4</p>
<p class="calibre1">Speaking	to	the	Fickleson	family	was	easier	than	Longhorn	expected.	Longhorn had	experience	giving	bad	news	to	families	who	lost	sons	in	war.	Jonse’s	father had	seen	the	boy	before	Longhorn	had	gotten	there	and	that	made	it	easier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing	Longhorn	could	say	to	Master	Fickleson	would	be	worse	than	finding his	boy	in	that	gruesome	state.	The	boy’s	mother	sat	in	a	chair	looking	out	of	one of	the	small	house’s	windows.	Her	face	was	gray. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	sorry	for	the	loss	of	your	boy,	lady	Fickleson.”	The	woman’s	dead	eyes met	Longhorns.	No	tears	fell	down	her	cheeks.	“I	will	do	everything	I	can	to catch	and	kill	the	beast	responsible.	You	have	my	word.”	Longhorn	remembered the	huge	paw	print	and	the	wounds	on	the	boy’s	back	and	wasn’t	sure	if	he believed	his	own	words.	He	bowed	to	them	and	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	his	walk	back	to	town	Longhorn	came	to	the	only	conclusion	he	could.	He needed	help.	Longhorn	didn’t	understand	what	was	out	there	but	he	would	not	sit back	and	hope	it	went	away.	When	he	got	back	to	the	office	he	pulled	a	quill,	an ink	well,	and	a	parchment	out	of	his	desk	and	began	to	write.	When	he	finished the	letter	he	stamped	it	with	his	crest	and	set	it	aside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Each	week	riders	from	the	King	traveled	to	the	villages	to	collect	taxes	and deliver	news.	The	following	morning	the	rider	arrived	and	Longhorn	gave	him the	note	along	with	that	week’s	tax	collections. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn	felt	relief	when	he	saw	the	letter	on	its	way	in	the	message	pouch	of the	royal	messenger	riding	back	to	the	King’s	city.	This	relief	left	him	when	he saw	the	gathering	outside	of	the	town’s	tavern. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>There	were	eight	of	them.	Longhorn	recognized	them	as	hunters,	woodsmen,	and some	of	the	larger	farmers	of	the	area.	Longhorn	hesitated	before	approaching them.	Putting	on	his	most	casual	look,	Longhorn	stepped	over	to	the	tavern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	day,	friends,”	All	eight	of	the	faces	turned	his	way	with	grim	expressions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	knew	what	he	was	going	to	say	and	they	didn’t	want	to	hear	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Longhorn.”	Rogard	Greyfellow	was	among	them	and	tipped	an	imaginary	hat towards	him	when	he	approached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	a	bit	early	for	the	evening’s	ale.	What	brings	you	all	here?	And	why	all	of the	equipment?”	Longhorn	nodded	towards	the	axes,	hammers,	and	picks	that each	one	of	the	eight	men	held. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	of	our	own	is	dead,	Longhorn.”	Longhorn	winced	at	the	implication.	OUR</p>
<p class="calibre1">own,	the	speaker	could	have	said.	Not	yours.	The	rest	of	the	group	remained silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Greyfellow,	you	saw	what	happened	to	the	boy	and	I	imagine	one	or	two	of	you others	have	seen	it	too.	I	don’t	know	what	did	that	but	I	am	going	to	find	out.	I have	no	doubt	that	it’s	very	dangerous.	I	know	you’re	probably	not	going	to listen	to	me	but	I’m	going	to	say	it	anyway.	Don’t	go	out	there.	Let	me	find	out what	I	can.	When	I	do	I	will	let	you	know	and	let	you	help	but	right	now	we don’t	know	what	did	that.”	It	was	the	longest	speech	Longhorn	had	given	to anyone	since	arriving	in	the	village.	The	eight	men	at	least	seemed	to	consider his	words	but	they	looked	to	Greyfellow	and	the	grizzly	man	just	looked	at	the sheriff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	take	care	of	our	own,	Longhorn.	We’ll	find	what	did	it	and	we’ll	bring	it back	on	a	spit.”	Longhorn	looked	into	the	eyes	of	each	of	the	eight	men	and	saw nothing	but	anger	in	their	eyes.	He	watched	as	the	group	headed	into	the	woods with	packs	on	their	backs	and	weapons	on	their	belts.	He	hoped	they	found nothing.	He	hoped	nothing	found	them.	5</p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn’s	hopes	were	met.	For	three	days	the	hunters	scoured	the	woods	with no	sign.	Each	day	they	left	into	the	woods	and	each	morning	they	returned empty	handed.	Longhorn	continued	to	appeal	to	them	but	to	no	avail.	Longhorn was	watching	them	prepare	for	their	forth	night	when	he	heard	the	squeeking wheels	of	a	merchant’s	cart	rolling	up	the	road	from	the	King’s	city. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>Sitting	next	to	the	cart’s	driver	was	a	small	man	dressed	in	brown	robes.	His hood	was	pulled	low	over	his	face	and	a	large	book	lay	open	on	his	lap.	The jerking	of	the	cart’s	stop	seemed	to	awaken	him	from	what	Longhorn	could	only assume	was	deep	concentration	or	sleep.	The	robed	fellow,	a	priest	from	the looks	of	him,	spotted	Longhorn.	The	priest	handed	a	small	package	to	the merchant,	grabbed	a	large	leather	pack	from	behind	his	seat	and	stumbled	down to	the	dirt	road.	He	approached	Longhorn	without	caution	or	self	consciousness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	bowed	deeply	and	almost	lost	the	full	contents	of	his	large	leather	pack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well	met,	sheriff.	My	name	is	Garity	of	the	Dryphusorian	Order.	I’m	here	to help	with	your	bear	problem.”	Longhorn	took	a	long	look	at	the	man.	He	was	a small	man,	slight	of	build	but	one	who	moved	with	the	graces	of	a	dancer.	He pulled	back	his	hood	and	looked	up	at	the	gray	skies.	His	head	was	smooth	and shaved	bald. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thank	you,	Garity,	but	I	am	not	so	sure	it’s	a	‘bear	problem’.”	Longhorn smiled	at	the	monk.	He	wasn’t	sure	what	response	he	expected	from	his message.	One	of	the	more	senior	commanders	of	the	watch	would	come, perhaps.	A	half	dozen	of	the	King’s	professional	hunters	arriving	would	be	more likely.	Instead	they	sent	him	a	priest.	Longhorn	tried	his	best	to	hide	his disappointment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	expecting	someone	else.	Someone…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bigger?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn	laughed.	“I	suppose	so.	Or	at	least	more	than	one	person.	I	don’t	really know	whats	out	there	but	it	tore	apart	a	young	boy.	I	expected	the	King	to	send some	soldiers	or	hunters.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	they	sent	a	dozen	or	two	dozen	men	and	had	them	scour	the	lands	every	night for	a	month	they	would	either	return	empty	handed	or	dead.	I	don’t	know	for sure	what	you	have	here,	but	if	I	am	right,	I	can	be	more	help	to	you	than	the King’s	guard.	I	spent	my	life	studying	these	things.	Let	me	help	you	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn	looked	at	the	man’s	hard	blue	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alright.”	Longhorn	held	out	his	hand	and	Garity	met	it	with	a	grip	like	a blacksmith.	“That’s	quite	a	hand	for	a	priest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I’m	full	of	surprises.”	Garity	gave	Longhorn	a	grin.	“I’d	like	to	take	a	look</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>at	the	place	where	the	boy	died.”	“Aye,”	Longhorn	said.	“Let	us	find	you	a	place to	stay	and	we	will	travel	out	tomorrow	morning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Garity’s	sharp	eyes	turned	to	the	tavern	where	that	night’s	hunting	party	gathered and	prepared	to	head	out.	“Tell	me	those	men	aren’t	heading	out	to	hunt	the beast.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	afraid	they	are.”	Longhorn	crossed	his	hands	in	front	of	his	chest,	expecting an	accusation.	Garity	gave	a	single	short	burst	of	laughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	all	going	to	die.”	6</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	village	buried	the	boy	two	days	earlier	but	the	rest	of	the	site	had	been	left alone.	Rain	washed	away	the	tracks	but	the	trees	lay	where	they	fell.	Garity,	his brown	robes	dragging	in	the	dirt,	had	thrown	his	hood	back	and	was	running	his hand	over	his	bald	head.	The	more	Longhorn	talked	to	the	monk,	the	more	he liked	him.	For	an	officer	of	the	court,	Garity	spoke	clearly	and	directly.	So	often members	of	the	court	spoke	volumes	without	saying	a	single	truthful	or	useful statement.	For	a	priest	and	monk	he	had	a	lot	of	wit.	Garity	covered	his	mouth with	his	hand	and	for	the	first	time	since	the	two	had	met,	Longhorn	saw something	other	than	cheer	and	security	in	the	small	man’s	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	said	the	tracks	were	about	ten	to	twelve	inches	across?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Garity	went	over	to	the	one	of	the	splintered	trees	and	looked	at	four	deep	claw marks	dug	into	it.	He	ran	his	finger	in	one	of	the	claw	marks,	drawing	it	out	to measure	the	depth.	Without	another	word,	Garity	began	walking	down	the	trail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	followed	the	broken	trees	for	half	a	mile.	Garity	stopped	at	each	one	and examined	any	claw	marks	they	found.	The	small	man	hunkered	down	in	the	mud not	seeming	to	care	that	his	brown	robe	had	splashed	into	a	rather	large	puddle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	smile	crossed	his	face.	He	had	found	a	track. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	right,	it’s	big.	Look	at	these	first	four	claws.	They’re	pretty	typical	for	a bear,	maybe	a	grizzly,	but	look	at	this	back	one.	The	paw	isn’t	circular,	it’s	long. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s	a	fifth	claw	over	here.”	Garity	took	a	small	pick	out	of	his	leather satchel.	It	had	a	curved	pointed	blade	and	a	two	foot	wooden	handle.	He	dug carefully	into	the	paw’s	print	with	the	point	of	the	blade. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>“What	does	that	mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	means	this	isn’t	just	a	bear.”	Garity	held	his	own	hand	out	to	Longhorn,	palm out,	and	wiggled	his	own	thumb.	He	stood	up	and	looked	into	the	woods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	once	heard	a	story	of	a	man	in	a	town	to	the	north.	He	went	out	hunting	one day	and	was	bit	by	some	huge	rabid	bear.	He	managed	to	kill	the	bear	but	the wound	got	infected.	He	crawled	up	into	his	hunting	cabin	a	few	miles	from	the town	and	no	one	heard	from	him	for	weeks.	One	day	a	party	of	the	townsfolk went	up	there	to	see	what	had	happened	to	him.	They	found	him	but	he	had changed.	His	bones	had	broken	and	shifted.	Black	fur	covered	his	skin.	When	he saw	them	he	roared	and	attacked.	He	killed	three	of	the	men	before	the	other	two filled	him	with	arrows.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	saying	we’re	dealing	with	a	man	who	turned	into	a	bear?”	Longhorn looked	at	the	monk	as	his	question	hung	in	the	air.	Longhorn	felt	like	he	wore another	man’s	skin.	Was	he	really	out	in	the	woods	with	a	priest	of	the	King talking	about	a	man	who	turned	into	a	bear?	Garity	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	impossible,	Garity.”	Longhorn	shook	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.”	Garity	pointed	down	the	row	of	broken	trees.	“That’s	impossible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	easy	to	recognize	the	strength	of	whatever	chased	down	and	ate	the	boy.	We know	it’s	big.	We	know	it’s	strong.	We	know	it	has	big	claws.	But	what	isn’t being	seen	is	how	fast	it	was.	That	boy	must	have	been	running	like	the	wind, but	this	thing	chased	him	for	half	a	mile	and	caught	him.	It	chased	him	smashing down	tree	after	tree.	And	think	about	these	claw	marks	for	a	moment.	Think really	hard	and	imagine	the	bear	chasing	him	down.	What	have	we	missed	so far.”	Longhorn	didn’t	like	puzzles	but	he	humored	the	priest.	He	looked	down the	rows	of	broken	trees.	He	looked	at	the	claw	marks.	He	looked	at	the	muddy path	that	broke	down	shrubs	and	underbrush.	His	eyes	opened	wide	and	he looked	at	Garity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	running	on	two	legs.”	7</p>
<p class="calibre1">When	they	left	the	village,	Hafol	and	the	party	of	hunters	felt	good	about themselves.	Hafol,	the	blacksmith’s	assistant,	was	confident	that	they	would	find and	kill	whatever	beast	was	in	their	woods.	It	had	rained	the	first	night	but	the next	two	were	clear	and	warm.	The	moon	brightened	the	shadows.	The	party</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>kept	watches	at	their	camp	half	a	mile	from	the	original	attacks	location.	They told	jokes.	They	roasted	a	pig	in	a	large	fire,	claiming	it	as	bait	but	enjoying	it thoroughly.	Were	it	not	for	the	murder	they	were	here	to	avenge,	the	eight	men would	have	enjoyed	their	time	away	from	the	nagging	of	their	wives	and	the crying	of	their	children. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	fourth	night	rain	fell	from	the	sky	at	dusk	and	it	fell	harder	as	the	night grew.	No	fire	would	take	and	Hafol	sat	shivering	and	quiet	with	his	wet	cloak pulled	around	him.	Fatigue	wrapped	him	like	a	cold	wet	blanket.	Four	nights	he had	spent	out	here	and	they	had	nothing	at	all	to	show	for	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	cracked	in	the	woods.	A	tree,	thick	from	the	sound	of	it,	cracked	and fell	down.	A	surge	of	adrenaline	flowed	into	Hafol’s	veins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	their	credit,	as	tired	as	they	were,	every	one	of	the	other	men	shot	to	their	feet with	weapons	in	hand.	They	were	alert.	They	were	prepared.	Every	one	of	them died	in	less	than	two	minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rantho,	the	butcher	of	the	town,	was	the	first.	A	few	seconds	after	the	first	tree fell,	another	cracked	and	fell	on	the	outskirts	of	their	camp.	It	smashed	Rantho right	in	the	back	of	the	neck	and	the	only	sound	louder	than	the	crack	of	the	tree was	the	crack	of	the	butcher’s	spine.	Jariko,	Rantho’s	brother	and	owner	of	the Lone	Tree	ranch,	died	next	when	he	ran	to	Rantho	and	a	black	shape	blasted	into his	chest,	crushing	his	sternum	and	sending	four	ribs	into	his	lungs.	The	massive creature	crashed	into	the	camp	like	black	fury.	It	roared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five	of	the	remaining	hunters	fell	to	their	knees	under	the	beast’s	roar.	Three	of them	dropped	their	weapons	and	placed	their	hands	over	their	ears.	Haron,	one of	the	four	farmers	who	joined	the	hunt,	was	praying	when	the	beast’s	claw ripped	off	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only	Greyfellow	held	his	ground.	Hafol	stood	hynotized	as	he	saw	the	huge	man standing	in	the	camp	with	his	legs	wide	and	planted	in	the	ground.	Rain	splashed unnoticed	on	his	face.	He	pulled	his	heavy	axe	high	into	the	air	and	rushed towards	the	massive	black	shape.	He	reached	the	beast	just	after	it	mauled	and threw	Yorin	Jamison’s	corpse	against	a	tree	where	it	hung	limp	in	the	branches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Four	huge	slashes	in	Yorin’s	chest	poured	blood	onto	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lightning	flashed	and	Hafol	got	his	first	look	at	the	sheer	size	of	the	beast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Greyfellow	was	the	largest	man	in	the	village	but	this	creature	stood	twice	as	tall</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>and	twice	as	wide.	Grayfellow	looked	like	a	child	in	front	of	it.	Hafol	felt	his bladder	let	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Greyfellow’s	cleaved	his	axe	into	the	beast’s	leg.	The	large	man’s	cry	of	victory was	dwarfed	by	another	of	the	beast’s	deafening	roars.	Greyfellow	stood paralyzed	by	the	roar.	The	beast	twisted	its	head	to	one	side	and	bit,	crushing Greetree’s	skull	in	an	explosion	of	blood	and	bone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hafol	turned	and	fled.	He	ran	hard	in	the	opposite	direction	of	the	beast.	A	few seconds	later	he	heard	a	scream	and	a	few	seconds	after	that	he	heard	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	didn’t	slow	down.	He	might	have	regretted	leaving	his	two	remaining	friends back	at	the	blood	bath	that	had	been	their	jolly	hunters’	camp	but	right	now	he wanted	to	run	to	the	opposite	side	of	the	world.	His	nerves	fired	again	when	he heard	the	crashing	of	trees	close	behind	him.	His	lungs,	unused	to	such	trauma, felt	like	they	were	ripping	apart.	The	crashing	got	closer.	His	heart	threatened	to explode	in	his	chest	and	his	legs	were	numb	with	pain.	He	tripped	and	fell	into the	mud.	He	got	up	on	his	hands	and	tried	to	run	but	fell	face	first	again.	He looked	down.	His	leg	was	gone	below	the	knee.	His	scream	burst	into	a	wet gurgle	a	few	seconds	later	when	four	white	claws	buried	themselves	in	his throat.	The	last	of	the	hunters	died	in	a	puddle	of	mud	and	rain	and	blood.	8</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sight	of	the	boy	torn	to	shreds	five	days	earlier	had	been	the	worst	thing Longhorn	had	ever	seen,	until	now.	The	sight	of	the	boy	was	the	scene	of	a single	murder,	this	was	the	scene	of	a	massacre. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	and	Garity	could	make	little	sense	of	the	carnage.	It	was	as	though	the hunters	had	fallen	into	a	sea	of	knives.	It	looked	like	twenty	or	thirty	wolves	had done	this,	not	a	single	beast.	Four	hours	of	investigation	revealed	the	same evidence	they	had	found	at	the	death	of	Jonse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Garity	stepped	over	to	Longhorn	and	out	of	earshot	of	the	rest	of	the townspeople	who	had	come	to	the	horrible	scene.	He	stood	silent	next	to	the sheriff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	no	idea	what	to	do.”	Under	normal	circumstances,	Longhorn	would	not have	been	so	open	with	someone	he	knew	less	than	a	week	but	these circumstances	were	far	from	normal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Garity	looked	at	him,	his	face	somber. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>“I	don’t	have	to	tell	you	that	this	isn’t	your	fault.	You’re	smart	enough	to	know that	on	your	own.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	we	even	know	that	one	beast	did	this?	It	could	be	two,	or	five,	or	ten.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn	felt	himself	beginning	to	panic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	just	one.	The	tracks,	the	paths,	they	show	just	one	creature.	It	moves	like five	and	it	has	the	strength	of	twenty,	but	it’s	just	one	beast.”	Garity	put	his	hand on	Longhorn’s	shoulder.	Longhorn	looked	over	to	the	small	group	of	farmers who	dared	to	stomach	the	gruesome	scene. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	came	here	to	protect	these	people	and	now	nine	of	them	are	dead.	Their	blood is	on	my	hands	and	I	have	to	do	something	about	it.	Tomorrow	the	King’s messenger	will	arrive.	I	am	going	to	give	him	another	letter	and	ask	for	a garrison	of	his	guards.	He	may	not	send	that	many	but	even	a	few	will	help.	We have	to	kill	whatever	is	out	here	and	we	have	to	do	it	soon.	This	town	is	on	the verge	of	disintegrating.”	Garity	nodded	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	right.	We	may	need	those	guards.	We	may	need	the	King’s	hunters	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said	Garity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	two	men	made	it	back	to	town	late	in	the	afternoon.	Every	eye	of	the	town followed	the	two	men	as	they	entered	the	tavern.	9</p>
<p class="calibre1">For	one	hundred	and	twenty	years,	the	Leaning	Oak	Inn	had	served	drinks,	hot food,	and	shelter	to	travelers	and	villagers	of	Relis	alike.	It	was	the	second largest	establishment	in	the	town	next	to	the	church.	The	tavern	could	serve	half of	the	village	in	one	sitting	if	needed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Frendal	was	proud	of	his	Inn.	He,	his	wife	Gloriana,	and	his	two	daughters	kept the	tavern	running	smoothly	and	they	earned	a	good	living	from	it.	Gloriana	did the	cooking	and	his	daughters	served	the	tables	and	prepared	the	rooms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Travelers	and	guests	of	the	town	could	rent	one	of	four	rooms	upstairs	for	five silver	a	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Late	into	the	night,	the	stranger	entered	the	Leaning	Oak.	A	dark	brown	cloak covered	in	mud	hung	over	his	head	and	shoulders.	Frendal	had	begun	shuffling out	the	late	night	drinkers	and	wiping	down	one	of	the	fifteen	tables	on	the	main floor	when	the	cloaked	man	entered.	The	man	was	not	big	but	still	seemed	to	fill the	frame	of	the	door.	Frendal	couldn’t	see	his	deep	hood.	The	man	carried	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>large	pack	on	his	back.	Leather	straps	held	a	massive	bow	next	to	the	pack.	The bow	was	four	inches	thick	at	the	center,	and	almost	as	tall	as	the	man	who carried	it.	Frendal	imagined	it	would	take	three	men	to	string	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	evening,	friend.	We	were	just	closing	up	for	the	night.”	Frendal	tried	his best	to	keep	his	nervousness	out	of	his	voice,	but	something	about	the	man scared	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	need	a	room.”	The	voice	of	the	stranger	was	gruff	and	scratchy,	the	sound	of falling	gravel.	The	stranger	threw	back	his	hood	revealing	the	face	of	an	old man,	leathery	from	the	sun	with	deep	lines	crossing	his	cheeks	and	brow.	His thin	hair	hung	down	over	his	shoulders	and	he	carried	four	days	of	beard	on	his wrinkled	cheeks.	He	scanned	the	room	with	vacant	gray	eyes	but	when	they locked	onto	Frendal,	the	barkeep	turned	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	in	luck,	friend.	I	have	one	room	left.”	Frendal	stepped	around	the	bar, picked	up	old	Jacke,	a	regular	patron	of	the	tavern,	by	the	scruff	of	his	jacket, and	shoved	him	towards	the	door.	The	drunk	stumbled	out	of	the	bar.	“You	must excuse	me.	We	hardly	see	one	visitor	a	week	and	now	we	have	two	in	two	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	not	used	to	travelers	coming	in	the	middle	of	the	night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	much	for	the	room?”	The	old	man	continued	to	look	around	the	room paying	no	attention	to	the	bartender’s	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Five	silver	a	night.	My	name’s	Frendal.	What	might	your	name	be?”	Frendal stuck	his	hand	out	towards	the	old	man.	The	gray	eyes	locked	on	his	again	and	it was	all	Frendal	could	do	not	to	put	his	hand	down	and	step	away.	The	old	man took	it	and	shook	it	once	so	hard	that	the	bartender	felt	his	arm	almost	come	out of	its	socket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Char.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	word	hung	heavy	in	the	silent	tavern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	room	is	down	that	hall	and	on	the	left.	You	can	pay	me	in	the	morning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Frendal	rubbed	his	shoulder	and	went	back	around	the	bar	to	finish	up	for	the night.	“It’s	lucky	you	got	here	when	you	did.	It’s	not	safe	to	travel	tonight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People	speak	of	a	beast	in	the	woods.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know.	That’s	why	I’m	here.”	10</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>“I	was	thirteen	when	my	father	and	I	went	out	in	the	woods	to	hunt	down	a	wolf that	had	killed	some	of	our	cattle.	My	father	loved	the	chance	to	go	out	in	the woods,	he	was	a	hunter	before	he	met	my	mother	and	he	always	missed	it	when he	settled	down.”	Garity	sipped	at	his	tea	at	one	of	the	tables	in	the	Leaning	Oak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn	picked	at	his	afternoon	meal	with	little	appitite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	lost	three	cattle	the	night	before	and	he	wasn’t	about	to	lose	any	more.	He had	a	musket.	I	don’t	know	where	he	got	it,	this	was	right	after	the	King	had outlawed	any	firearms	to	anyone	but	the	King’s	armies.	We	spent	hours	in	the woods	until	the	sun	went	down	over	the	western	mountains.	The	trees	were	like dead	people	staring	down	at	us.	The	tracks	got	fresher	and	I	could	see	how	big they	were	but	my	father	told	me	it	was	the	way	the	wolf	ran	that	made	them	look so	big. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	then	there	it	is.	It	came	out	around	a	tree	like	hell	itself.	It	wasn’t	a	wolf,	it was	a	dire	wolf.	It	must	have	weighed	as	much	as	one	of	the	cows	it	ate	but	it was	lean.	It	looked	at	my	father	with	those	blazing	red	eyes	and	blood	and	spit coming	out	over	its	teeth.	The	teeth	were	as	long	as	that	steak	knife	you’re holding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	father	held	up	the	musket.	I	don’t	think	I	could	have	been	prouder	of	him.	I was	scared	to	death	but	there	was	my	father	facing	this	huge	beast	and	holding up	the	musket.	He	pulled	the	trigger.	Nothing.	Not	even	a	spark.	I	remember silence.	The	dire	wolf	looking	at	us.	My	father	not	believing	that	the	musket didn’t	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Garity	started	to	laugh.	“He	threw	it	at	him.	He	threw	the	whole	musket	at	the wolf	and	it	caught	it	in	its	mouth.	The	wolf	twisted	it	like	a	pretzel	and	ate	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	father	grabbed	my	hand	and	we	ran.	We	ran	for	an	hour	and	into	the	farm house.	My	mother	jumped	up	in	a	panic,	seeing	the	looks	on	our	faces.	‘what happend?’	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘nothing.	Let’s	go	to	bed’	my	father	said	back.”	Garitky	kept	laughing	and Longhorn	started	laughing	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	didn’t	hear	a	thing	for	weeks.	Our	remaining	cows	were	fine.	We	went	out	a few	weeks	later	early	in	the	morning	and	we	found	it.”	Garity	started	laughing</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>again.	“It	died.	It	died	eating	the	musket.	Some	part	of	the	barrel	or	something didn’t	agree	with	it.	My	father	wouldn’t	take	any	part	of	it	back.	He	said	it	was the	work	of	demons	and	best	left	for	the	Gods	to	bury.	I	remember	looking	down at	the	wolf’s	jaws.	They	were	huge.	I	was	hooked.	I	enrolled	in	the	church	and began	the	study	of	the	beasts	of	legend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn	wiped	away	the	tears	in	his	eyes.	He	turned	and	saw	Frendal	scowling at	him.	He	remembered	the	sight	from	the	day	before	and	any	laughter	fell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Frendal	gave	him	a	nod	and	gestured	over	to	the	old	man	in	the	corner	eating	a steak	nearly	as	big	as	the	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	Char,	isn’t	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know.	I’ve	never	seen	him,	but	the	description	fits.	Let’s	go	find	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Garity	stood	up	and	Longhorn	followed.	The	two	of	them	approached	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	morn,	my	friend.	You	wouldn’t	happen	to	be	Char,	would	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am.”	The	old	man	didn’t	bother	swallowing	the	piece	of	meat	he	had	in	his mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	sheriff	Longhorn.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	who	ye	are	and	I	know	what	you	want.	There’s	a	beast	in	your	wood here;	a	beast	that	needs	killing	and	I’m	the	one	to	do	it.”	The	old	man	turned	his gray	eyes	on	Longhorn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	go	with	you.”	The	words	burst	out	of	Garity	and	Longhorn	turned shocked.	“You	can’t	expect	to	hold	a	camp	and	hunt	the	beast	with	just	yourself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	takes	three	good	people	to	hunt	down	something	like	this.	It	doesn’t	run straight,	it	weaves.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	your	beasts,	don’t	you.”	A	smile	crept	up	one	side	of	Char’s	deep and	lined	face.	String	this	bow.	With	a	smooth	motion,	Char	slipped	his	huge bow	from	his	pack	and	tossed	it	at	Garity.	The	monk	caught	it	in	flight.	He turned	to	Longhorn	and	shook	his	head	with	a	sigh.	The	monk	planted	one	foot on	the	ground,	held	the	bow	behind	him,	and	bent	forward	while	simultaneously drawing	the	loose	bowstring	up	the	shaft.	The	huge	bow	creaked	and	arched	as the	Monk’s	body	moved.	The	string	snapped	into	the	groove	at	the	top	and	held taught.	He	held	the	bow	out	to	Char	horizontally.	Char	took	the	bow	without</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>looking	at	it	and	grabbed	Garity’s	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“These	callouses	are	thick	and	your	knuckles	raw.	How	can	a	book	wielding priest	get	hands	like	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	full	of	surprises.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Char	looked	hard	and	gave	a	single	burst	of	laughter	that	caused	Frendal	to	drop a	glass	on	the	bar	with	a	thud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alright.	We	leave	at	dusk.	Go	get	ready.”	11</p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn	sat	in	his	office	with	his	soft	leather	boots	up	on	his	desk	but	stress tied	his	muscles	together	like	a	tight	cord.	His	mind	raced	around	the	events	of the	last	few	days.	Six	days	ago	he	worried	about	dying	of	boredom	and	now	he would	give	anything	to	be	back	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	his	town.	He	accepted	the	order	to	protect	it	and	protect	it	he	would. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn	swung	his	feet	around	and	stood	up.	He	opened	a	cabinet	on	the room’s	wall	and	took	out	a	cloth	bundle.	He	placed	the	bundle	on	the	desk	with	a heavy	thud	and	unwrapped	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	returned	from	the	southern	battles,	the	King	rewarded	him	personally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Kingdom’s	best	smith	forged	him	the	finest	blade	Longhorn	had	ever	seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	of	the	royal	court	wore	ceremonial	swords,	swords	that	looked	nice	but would	most	likely	shatter	if	they	hit	anything	hard.	This	blade	was	made	for	war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carved	grooves	on	the	hardwood	hilt	kept	its	wielder’s	hand	from	slipping.	A roaring	lion	of	gold	with	ruby	eyes	decorated	the	base	of	the	hilt.	The	King’s sigil	and	four	sapphires	adorned	the	cross-guard.	A	pair	of	curved	silver	lines	ran up	the	double-edge	of	the	folded	steel.	Priests	of	the	King	had	carved	runes along	the	blade’s	center	during	a	ceremony	that	lasted	two	days.	The	sword	was priceless	and	deadly.	The	priests	called	it	Shadowhewer.	Longhorn	hadn’t	taken it	out	since	he	arrived	at	the	small	town.	There	was	little	use	for	a	blade	like	this in	Relis,	but	every	day	it	sat	in	the	locked	cabinet	was	a	day	it	could	not	do	what it	had	been	made	for. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn	pulled	the	blade	from	its	darkwood	scabbard	and	held	it	to	the	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fire	of	the	lantern	reflected	in	the	two	tones	of	steel	and	silver	along	the blade.	The	ruby	eyes	of	the	lion	burned	with	a	desire	to	do	battle	or	perhaps	the desire	for	battle	was	Longhorn’s.	When	he	went	out	in	those	woods	tonight,	he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>could	think	of	no	finer	weapon	to	carry	with	him.	He	took	off	his	sheriff’s	blade and	hung	Shadowhewer	low	on	his	left	hip.	He	buckled	and	tied	his	wide	leather belt	in	the	style	he	used	for	war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nervous	energy	filled	Longhorn’s	heart	but	he	knew	this	was	what	he	must	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	his	town.	He	accepted	its	charge	and	he	would	protect	it.	He	had expected	to	spend	his	days	listening	to	arguments	about	oxen	and	his	nights kicking	drunks	out	of	the	local	bar.	He	never	expected	to	battle	an	unknown beast	in	the	middle	of	the	night,	but	it	was	his	job	and	he	would	do	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn	placed	his	hands	on	his	desk,	his	head	dipping	down.	He	closed	his eyes	and	visions	of	previous	battles	flowed	through	him.	Memories	long	buried crawled	out	of	the	gray	fog	of	his	past.	He	remembered	leading	a	charge	of	forty men	over	a	hill	into	nearly	two	hundred	Voth	barbarians.	He	remembered pinning	a	Voth	axe-wielder	under	his	steel	boot	and	hammering	a	spear	through the	huge	man’s	leather	chestguard.	He	remembered	the	smell	of	sweat	and gunpowder	and	blood	soaking	into	the	earth.	Longhorn	opened	his	eyes.	He could	no	longer	afford	to	be	the	retired	military	man	now	serving	as	sheriff	of	a small	town.	He	had	to	be	the	hand	of	the	King	again,	the	sword	of	the	Fiagon Empire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn	opened	the	door	and	stepped	out	into	the	town.	12</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	three	men	walked	in	silence	in	the	dusk	of	the	coming	night.	Wind	howled through	the	trees	and	dark	clouds	marked	the	coming	of	another	storm.	Char wore	his	large	pack	and	thick	bow	on	his	back.	The	old	man	seemed	to	know where	he	was	going	and	the	two	other	men	followed	his	lead.	By	nightfall	they reached	their	campsite,	a	place	Char	prepared	earlier	in	the	day.	He	went	about setting	up	the	small	camp	and	then	pulled	a	variety	of	strange	metal	devices	out of	his	pack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Traps,”	he	said,	not	looking	up	from	his	work.	“They	won’t	stop	the	beast	but they’ll	let	us	know	it’s	around.”	Garity	and	Longhorn	exchanged	looks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	not	going	to	hunt	out	its	lair?”	said	Longhorn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	whole	forest	is	its	lair.	On	a	fine	soft	night	like	this,	it	will	come	to	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	no	further	word,	Char	got	up	and	went	into	the	woods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	old	man	returned	to	the	camp	a	short	time	later.	He	continued	his	silence	as</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>he	bent	and	strung	his	huge	bow	in	the	same	technique	Garity	showed	at	the	inn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	dug	into	the	large	pack	and	took	out	a	quiver	of	long	arrows.	He	drew	one	of these	arrows	out	and	inspected	the	barbed	head.	The	head	shined	in	the	light	of the	small	camp	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Garity	broke	the	silence.	“What	are	we	facing	here,	Char?”	Char	continued	his preparations,	sticking	the	large	arrow	into	the	ground	and	pulling	out	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	barbarians	call	it	a	Garthoulan.	A	twisted	creature	of	half	man	and	half beast.	I’ve	been	tracking	this	one	for	seven	weeks	now.	These	beasts	are	strong, fast,	and	deadly.	They	hunt	like	you	or	I	would.	They	have	claws	as	long	as knives	and	teeth	like	broken	glass.”	Char	finished	his	inspections	and	squatted down	by	the	fire.	His	eyes	shined	yellow	in	the	light	of	the	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	have	any	advice?”	asked	Longhorn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Char	fixed	his	steel	eyes	on	the	town’s	sheriff	a	barbed	arrow	in	his	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	let	it	bite	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn	looked	over	at	Garity.	Char	gave	them	a	hard	narrow	stare	and	then broke	out	in	deep	laughter.	The	two	men	watched	the	old	man	for	a	moment	and then	exploded	in	laughter	themselves.	All	three	of	them	laughed	into	the darkness	of	the	night.	Garity	reached	out	and	slapped	Char	on	the	knot	of	one hard	shoulder.	Something	dark	on	Char’s	bare	arm	caught	Garity’s	attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	that	on	your	arm,	Char?	A	scar?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Char	didn’t	look	down	at	the	curving	scar	on	his	arm.	It	didn’t	look	like	single cut	or	tear,	but	a	series	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	used	to	be	a	tattoo	before	I	cut	it	off.	It	used	to	say	“Faigon	Graywolves”. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	were	one	of	the	Greywolves?”	Garity’s	eyes	went	wide.	Longhorn	looked over	to	Garity	and	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	were	the	King’s	regiment	who	went	through	the	southern	lines	and	killed the	Voth	King,”	Garity	explained	to	the	sheriff.	“They	cut	off	the	head	of	the Voth	armies	and	sent	the	rest	of	them	into	disarray.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>“I	never	heard	that,”	said	Longhorn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	weren’t	meant	to,”	said	Char,	his	voice	low	and	guttural.	Char’s	eyes	went narrow	and	hard	again,	looking	through	Longhorn	and	into	the	shadows	of	the past.	“There	were	two	hundred	of	us,	trained	and	armed	from	the	best weaponmasters	in	the	King’s	army.	We	didn’t	wear	shining	armor	or	carry banners.	We	looked	like	a	bunch	of	refugees.	We	spent	two	years	training	for	a single	week. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	slipped	through	the	Voth	lines	individually	or	in	pairs.	Sometimes	we	snuck in	with	families	orphaned	in	the	outskirting	villages.	We	met	again	outside	of	the Voth	King’s	camp,	about	forty	miles	south	of	the	front	lines.	He	had	a	thousand men	with	him.	Late	at	night	we	entered	the	camp	and	murdered	the	barbarian King	as	he	slept.	They	killed	Fifty	of	us	when	the	camp	awoke,	and	captured	the other	one	hundred	and	fifty	of	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	dragged	us	into	the	woods	that	night,	speaking	in	their	short	and	spitting language.	They	painted	symbols	on	our	chests	in	the	blood	of	our	friends, strange	symbols	from	a	lost	religion	worshiping	bestial	gods	I	never	wanted	to know	about.	They	tied	us	to	trees	in	fours,	each	at	a	compass	point	of	the	tree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	they	left.	No	guards,	no	fires,	just	darkness	and	silence	in	the	forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	rained	that	night,	a	lot	like	it’s	raining	tonight.	Thunder	cracked	in	the	woods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	heard	screams	from	those	tied	to	the	furthest	trees.	They	sounded	like animals,	pigs	squealing	as	their	bellies	are	torn	open.	Things	roared	in	the darkness	with	lungs	larger	than	any	man.	It	went	on	all	night.	One	by	one	they ate	us.	They	took	their	time	and	enjoyed	their	meal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	tied	next	to	a	friend	of	mine,	Jenfen	Willowwind	from	Danark.	We whispered	to	each	other	in	the	dark	trying	not	to	go	insane	as	our	friends	were ripped	to	shreds	all	around	us,	one	by	one.	It	went	on	all	night	long;	the	thunder cracking,	the	lightning	showing	us	huge	shapes	moving	through	the	trees,	and the	screaming	and	wailing	of	our	friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	next	morning	I	looked	over	and	Jenfen	was	looking	at	me	with	wide	eyes.	I looked	down	and	something	had	bitten	him	in	half	below	the	waist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	forward	regiment	of	the	King’s	army	broke	through	that	morning	and	pushed back	the	Voth	further	south.	They	cut	us	free	one	by	one	but	all	I	could	think about	was	Jenfen’s	voice	whispering	to	me	in	the	dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>“When	we	left	Faigon	and	headed	south	we	had	two	hundred	men.	They	cut	six of	us	from	the	trees	that	day.	Faigon’s	Graywolves	died	in	the	woods.	I	cut	off the	tattoo	and	left	my	service	with	my	dead	friends.”	Char	took	a	deep	drink from	the	flask	at	his	belt.	“We	killed	the	King,	though,	and	started	the	end	of	the war.”	13</p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	three	hours	into	the	evening	when	the	first	of	Char’s	traps	sprung.	A	crack of	metal	on	wood	brought	all	three	of	the	men	to	their	feet.	Longhorn	drew	his sword	and	even	within	the	stress	of	the	moment,	Garity’s	eyes	were	drawn	to	the beautiful	blade.	Another	crack	broke	through	the	night	air.	Then	silence.	All three	men	stood	ready	for	anything.	Char	had	one	of	his	huge	barbed	arrows knocked	in	his	massive	bow.	The	three	men	heard	another	crack,	this	time	far away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	moving.	Lets	go.”	Char	ran	into	the	woods.	Longhorn	drew	Shadowhewer from	his	belt	and	followed	the	hunter	into	the	woods.	He	was	fifty	yards	into	the woods	when	he	noticed	that	Garity	hadn’t	followed.	Longhorn	heard	a	thick twang	ahead	and	a	curse	in	a	tongue	unknown	to	Longhorn.	He	came	upon	Char standing	next	to	a	gnarled	tree	with	one	of	his	arrows	pierced	through	it,	its	tip protruding	from	the	other	side.	He	already	had	another	arrow	knocked	and	ready. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	and	looked	at	Longhorn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’s	the	priest?”	In	reply	both	men	heard	another	crack	from	behind	them, near	the	camp.	They	ran	towards	it.	Before	they	arrived	they	heard	a	tree	crash	to the	ground.	A	roar	broke	open	the	night.	Garity	screamed.	The	two	men	crashed through	the	underbrush	and	into	the	camp.	The	fire	had	been	stamped	out	and buried	under	a	huge	paw	print.	Garity’s	robe,	torn	and	covered	in	blood	lay	in	a heap.	Char	aimed	his	bow	into	the	darkness,	half	drawn.	The	muscles	on	his arms	and	back,	muscles	of	a	man	one	third	his	age,	strained	against	the resistance	of	the	huge	bow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	gone.”	Longhorn’s	eyes	went	to	the	huge	pool	of	blood.	It	held	little	doubt of	Garity’s	fate.	Garity	might	be	running	through	the	woods	with	his	belly	torn open	and	his	heart	pumping	out	its	last	blood	by	now.	A	tree	creaked	and splintered	and	a	huge	shadow	fell	upon	them.	Char	drew	and	fired.	Both	men heard	the	thud	of	it	sinking	into	meat	and	chipping	off	of	bone.	The	beast	roared again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn	once	heard	the	roar	of	one	hundred	barbarians	storming	over	a	hill. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>What	the	barbarians	lacked	in	battle	tactics,	they	made	up	for	in	volume.	The roar	had	the	younger	men	of	his	army	shaking	like	old	women.	He	felt	the	fear of	battle	in	his	heart	when	he	heard	that	roar	but	the	barbarians’	roar	was	nothing compared	to	the	roar	of	the	beast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn	felt	nauseous.	He	wanted	to	fall	to	the	ground	and	cover	himself	in mud.	He	wanted	to	run.	Using	every	ounce	of	strength	he	had,	he	held	his	blade high	and	held	his	ground.	Char	seemed	unaffected	by	the	roar.	Longhorn	knew the	old	man	had	heard	it	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	beast	was	huge	but	they	could	see	little	of	it	in	the	darkness	of	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only	the	beast’s	blazing	red	eyes	shone	like	pinpoints	of	hellfire.	Char	drew	and fired	another	barbed	arrow	and	the	arrow	struck	home.	One	of	the	beast’s	eyes burst	into	a	shower	of	blood.	The	beast	reared	back	and	howled	in	anger	and pain.	It	smashed	one	massive	arm	back	and	crushed	a	tree	that	got	in	the	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Char	had	another	arrow	ready	but	the	beast	was	too	fast.	It	fell	low	to	the	ground its	powerful	legs	curled	under	it	like	a	spring.	With	a	lunge,	the	beast	swiped	its claws	past	Char.	Longhorn	caught	the	glimpse	of	four	shining	claws	and	a	trail of	blood.	Char’s	bowstring	snapped	and	the	bow	fell	to	the	ground.	Char	spun around	and	Longhorn	saw	how	severe	the	wounds	were.	One	cut	tore	open	his belly.	Another	ripped	the	man’s	chest	open	exposing	the	white	of	his	ribs.	A	third severed	his	throat.	The	fourth	slashed	both	of	the	man’s	eyes.	Blood	sprayed from	his	moral	wounds	and	the	old	hunter	fell	dead	to	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	forest	was	quiet.	The	cold	of	shock	flowed	over	Longhorn.	The	sheriff’s eyes	went	from	the	dead	hunter	to	the	beast	in	front	of	him.	It	rose	on	its	legs and	for	the	first	time	Longhorn	got	a	full	look	at	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	nine	feet	tall	and	only	its	head	resembled	a	bear.	Its	waist	was	thin	and two	huge	legs	held	it	up	on	oval	paws	tipped	with	gleaming	claws.	Its	chest	was wide,	corded	with	muscle	and	thick	hair.	It	held	long	arms	out	to	its	side	each tipped	with	four	claws	and	what	looked	like	a	thumb.	Longhorn	could	feel	the rumble	of	its	breathing,	deep	and	powerful.	Its	remaining	eye	blazed.	Char’s arrow	protruded	out	of	the	socket	of	the	other.	It	opened	its	mouth	and	bared	its long	fangs.	Longhorn	saw	blood	flowing	from	another	wound	along	one	of	the huge	creature’s	legs.	The	beast	roared	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	took	every	ounce	of	will	to	keep	his	sword	from	falling	to	the	ground.	The	roar</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>was	so	loud	Longhorn	could	almost	see	the	air	rippling	out	from	its	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn	stepped	back	on	his	right	foot	and	held	his	sword	back,	its	shining point	aiming	towards	the	beast.	The	beast	raised	its	left	claw	in	preparation	for	a swipe	that	would	tear	the	sheriff	into	pieces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	claw	whistled	through	the	air	as	it	swiped	in	at	Longhorn.	The	sheriff ducked	and	felt	the	wind	of	the	blow	on	the	back	of	his	neck.	Longhorn	sprung up	and	cut	hard	with	Shadowhewer.	Longhorn	cleaved	the	blade	into	the	beast’s side,	cutting	through	thick	flesh	down	to	the	creature’s	ribs.	The	bear	howled	in pain	and	slashed	again.	One	of	the	claws	scratched	a	deep	gash	across Longhorn’s	chest.	Longhorn	gritted	his	teeth	against	the	pain	and	struck	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	time	the	blade	cut	hard	into	the	huge	creature’s	arm.	Black	blood	sprayed into	the	night	air	but	the	creature	was	far	from	finished.	The	strike	put	Longhorn off	balance	and	a	swipe	of	the	back	of	the	beast’s	wounded	paw	sent	the	Sheriff sliding	through	the	dirt.	It	stood	upright	and	roared	raising	its	good	paw	to	tear the	life	from	Longhorn	with	every	ounce	of	its	weight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	black	shape	fell	from	the	tree	behind	the	beast.	Longhorn	hardly	recognized Garity.	The	priest	had	stripped	his	robes	revealing	a	well	muscled	body	filled with	power	and	flexibility	from	years	of	hard	training.	In	his	hand	he	held	the pick	Longhorn	had	seen	him	use	at	the	site	two	days	earlier	but	now	he	noticed the	gleam	of	the	pick’s	edge.	It	was	a	sickle	of	some	sort.	The	wound	on	the beasts	leg	and	the	blood	on	the	robe	made	sense	now.	It	wasn’t	the	priest’s	blood on	the	robe,	it	was	the	beast’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	a	dive	as	agile	as	an	acrobat,	Garity	dove	behind	the	beast	and	though	he could	not	see	it,	Longhorn	heard	the	tearing	of	the	blade	along	the	beast’s	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	beast	roared	again	in	rage	but	before	it	could	turn	to	face	Garity	the	nimble priest	had	rolled	through	its	legs	and	stood	in	front	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	priest	stood	with	his	legs	apart	and	his	knees	bent.	The	beast	slashed	down with	its	deadly	claws	preparing	to	mash	Garity	into	a	pile	of	broken	bone	and torn	flesh	but	the	monk	sidestepped	at	the	last	second	and	the	claw	found	only empty	dirt.	Before	it	could	recover	the	priest	attacked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Garity	slashed	down	with	the	sickle	tearing	a	diagonal	line	from	the	beast’s shoulder	down	to	its	belly.	The	wound	opened	and	blood	poured	out	from	the torn	flesh	and	muscle. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>But	the	beast	was	not	finished.	With	its	other	claw	it	smashed	forward	and	hit	the monk	solid.	He	shot	through	the	air	and	smashed	his	back	on	a	tree	on	the opposite	side	of	his	camp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn	saw	what	he	needed	to	see.	The	beast	was	huge	and	deadly	but	it	bled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	glared	at	Longhorn	with	its	one	blazing	eye.	It	breathed	in	raspy	and	hollow breaths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn	raised	his	sword	and	gritted	his	teeth.	Rain	fell	over	his	face	and dripped	from	his	hair.	He	felt	the	cold	fury	of	Shadowhewer	in	his	hand,	the blade	begging	to	bite	again	into	the	hideous	beast.	The	massive	creature	roared one	final	time	and	the	two	rushed	forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	mile	away	the	people	of	the	small	town	of	Relis	sat	awake	in	their	beds.	Cries of	pain	and	roars	of	fury	broke	through	their	dreams	and	left	them	shivering under	their	covers.	A	final	cry	shattered	the	night	air	and	then	all	was	quiet.	Most found	no	sleep	until	the	dawn.	14</p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn	and	Garity	walked	slowly	to	the	waiting	merchant	cart	that	would	take the	priest	back	to	the	King’s	city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I’m	glad	you	could	come	give	our	town	a	visit,	my	friend.	I	hope	you enjoyed	your	stay.”	Longhorn	smiled	a	the	priest.	Garity	laughed	loud	enough	to turn	the	heads	of	nosy	villagers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	food	isn’t	bad,	but	the	hunting	wasn’t	quite	what	I	expected.	Still,	this should	raise	a	few	eyebrows	at	the	Order.”	Garity	held	up	the	five	inch	claw	he wore	around	his	neck	on	a	leather	cord.	Garity	gave	Longhorn	a	long	look	and the	sheriff	knew	they	both	thought	about	Char	dying	in	the	rain.	“Take	care,	my friend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	too,	Garity.”	Longhorn	embraced	the	priest	and	saw	him	to	the	merchant cart.	He	waited	until	the	cart	had	turned	down	the	path	and	began	the	long journey	back	to	civilization. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn	walked	back	to	his	office,	Shadowhewer	hanging	comfortably	on	his side	from	his	wide	leather	belt.	The	blade	became	a	legend	in	the	town,	the slayer	of	the	Werebeast	of	Holstock	Wood.	Two	older	farmers	passed	Longhorn as	he	walked	down	the	town’s	main	road.	They	bowed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>“Good	evening,	Sheriff.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Longhorn	bowed	back.	When	the	two	passed,	a	smile	crept	onto	his	face.	After one	year	serving	the	small	village	Longhorn	could	finally	begin	to	enjoy	his retirement. </p>
