<p class="calibre1">The	glad	play,	by	Catherine	Chisholm	Cushing,	after	the	novel	by	Eleanor	H. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Porter.	 5	 males,	 6	 females.	 2	 interiors.	 Costumes,	 modern.	 Plays	 2¼	 hours.	 An orphan	 girl	 is	 thrust	 into	 the	 home	 of	 a	 maiden	 aunt.	 In	 spite	 of	 the	 trials	 that beset	her,	she	manages	to	find	something	to	be	glad	about,	and	brings	light	into sunless	lives.	Finally	Pollyanna	straightens	out	the	love	affairs	of	her	elders,	and finds	happiness	for	herself	in	Jimmy.	"Pollyanna"	gives	a	better	appreciation	of people	and	the	world.	It	reflects	the	humor	and	humanity	that	gave	the	story	such wonderful	popularity	among	young	and	old. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Produced	in	New	York,	and	for	two	seasons	on	tour.	Royalty,	$25.00.	Price, </p>
<p class="calibre1">75	cents. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a><b class="calibre3">Martha	By-the-Day</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">An	 optimistic	 comedy	 in	 3	 acts,	 by	 Julie	 M.	 Lippmann,	 author	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Martha"	 stories.	 5	 males.	 5	 females.	 3	 interiors.	 Costumes,	 modern.	 Plays	 2½</p>
<p class="calibre1">hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Full	of	quaint	humor,	old-fashioned,	homely	sentiment,	the	kind	that	people</p>
<p class="calibre1">who	see	the	play	will	recall	and	chuckle	over	tomorrow	and	the	next	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Lippmann	has	herself	adapted	her	successful	book	for	the	stage	and	has</p>
<p class="calibre1">selected	 from	 her	 novel	 the	 most	 telling	 incidents,	 infectious	 comedy	 and homely	 sentiment	 for	 the	 play,	 and	 the	 result	 is	 thoroughly	 delightful.	 Royalty, $25.	Price,	60	cents. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a><b class="calibre3">Seventeen</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 comedy	 of	 youth,	 in	 4	 acts,	 by	 Booth	 Tarkington.	 8	 males,	 6	 females.	 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">exterior.	2	interiors.	Costumes,	modern.	Plays	2½	hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	the	tragedy	of	William	Sylvanus	Baxter	that	he	has	ceased	to	be	sixteen and	is	not	yet	eighteen.	Seventeen	is	not	an	age,	it	is	a	disease. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	his	heart	William	knows	all	the	tortures	and	delights	of	love.	But	he	is	still sent	 by	 his	 mother	 on	 errands	 of	 the	 most	 humiliating	 sort	 and	 depends	 on	 his father	for	every	nickel,	the	use	of	which	he	must	justify	before	he	gets	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Silly"	Bill	fell	in	love	with	Lola,	the	"Baby-Talk	Lady,"	a	vapid	little	flirt.	To woo	her	in	a	manner	worthy	of	himself	(and	of	her)	he	steals	his	father's	evening clothes.	When	his	wooings	become	a	nuisance	to	the	neighborhood,	his	mother</p>
<p class="calibre1">steals	 them	 back,	 and	 has	 them	 let	 out	 to	 fit	 the	 middle-aged	 form	 of	 her husband,	thereby	keeping	William	at	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 when	 it	 comes	 to	 the	 "Baby-Talk	 Lady's"	 good-bye	 dance,	 not	 to	 be present	 was	 unendurable.	 Now	 William	 again	 gets	 the	 dress	 suit,	 and	 how	 he wears	it	at	the	party,	and	Genesis	discloses	the	fact	that	the	proud	garment	is	in reality	his	father's	makes	up	the	story	of	the	play. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Seventeen"	 is	 a	 work	 of	 exquisite	 human	 sympathy	 and	 delicious	 humor. </p>

<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	 You	 have	 evidently	 shot	 someone	 and	 are	 making	 me	 shield	 you from	justice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	( <i class="calibre4">Coming	down</i>)	No,	not	from	justice—but	from	the	law. </p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	I	thought	they	were	the	same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	No,	not	always—there	would	be	no	justice	for	me	at	the	hands	of	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	Well,	that	is	not	for	me	to	decide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	 But	 you	 shall	 decide—at	 least	 you	 shall	 listen	 and	 if	 you	 find	 me guilty—I'll—well,	I'll	take	that	door	or,	or	anything	you	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	Your	presumption	is	indeed	ridiculous. </p>

<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	( <i class="calibre4">Interrupting</i>)	He	may	come	back	any	minute—and	I	don't	dare	tell him	what	happened	at	the	Manhattan	Hotel—but	he	will	want	to	know	who	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	and	why	you	are	with	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	That's	what	I	want	to	know.	You	forget	I	am	completely	in	the	dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>PRINCESS.	( <i class="calibre4">Looking	out	of	window</i>)	The	police	can't	be	on	board	now.	( <i class="calibre4">Down</i> <i class="calibre4">stage. </i>)</p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	( <i class="calibre4">Going	to	window	beside	her,	and	then	back	again</i>)	You	can't	tell	until you	 see	 who	 goes	 ashore	 with	 the	 pilot.

Now	let's	get	down to	business.	What	is	the	matter—and	what	am	I	to	do? </p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	 ( <i class="calibre4">Hesitating</i>)	 I	 hardly	 know	 how	 to	 begin—it	 seems	 absurd	 in	 this broad	daylight	to	talk	of	ghosts—but	the	fact	is,	my	castle	is	haunted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	( <i class="calibre4">Laughing</i>)	Spooks? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a><a href="#p103">The	Ghost	Breaker,	Act	II</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	GHOST	BREAKER	 <i class="calibre4">See	<a href="#p44">Page	34</a></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	( <i class="calibre4">Very	seriously</i>)	Call	it	anything	you	like,	but	the	castle	is	haunted, just	the	same.	My	grandfather	was	one	of	the	wealthiest	nobles	in	Spain.	When he	died	my	father	went	to	take	possession	of	his	estate	in	Segura.	He	found	the town	 full	 of	 weird	 stories	 of	 uncanny	 happenings—the	 castle	 was	 deserted, everyone	 had	 fled	 and	 all	 told	 of	 something	 in	 armor	 that	 stalked	 the	 halls	 at night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	O-o-o-o-o-o-o-h! </p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	My	father	laughed	at	the	silly	natives	and	said	he	would	go	into	the castle	and	show	them	how	foolish	their	fears	were.	He	went,	and	was	never	seen again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	( <i class="calibre4">Naturally	deeply	interested</i>)	What	happened	to	him? </p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	No	one	knows.	He	disappeared—vanished	utterly,	without	leaving	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">single	clue—and	the	treasure's	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	( <i class="calibre4">More	interested	at	word	Treasure</i>)	Treasure—what	treasure? </p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	 My	 grandfather	 is	 known	 to	 have	 converted	 all	 his	 wealth	 into Spanish	gold.	It	amounted	to	about	a	million	dollars	in	your	money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	How	long	ago	was	that? </p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	Fifteen	years	ago.	Since	then	two	other	men	have	disappeared—just</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 my	 father	 did—and	 now,	 the	 Duke	 tells	 me	 that	 my	 brother	 has	 entered	 the castle.	You	see	it	runs	in	the	blood.	Up	to	a	week	ago	my	brother	had	sent	me	a cable	every	day,	then	suddenly	the	messages	ceased.	All	this	week	not	a	word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	I	know—my	brother	has	entered	the	castle,	and—well,	that	is	the	end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	Why	did	you	leave	Spain? </p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	 A	 part	 of	 the	 legend	 was	 that	 a	 plan	 had	 been	 made	 showing	 just where	 the	 treasure	 was	 located—but	 this	 plan	 could	 never	 be	 found.	 Only	 by accident	I	learned	that	this	plan	had	been	hidden	in	the	back	of	a	locket	and	the locket,	I	discovered,	had	been	sold	and	was	in	America.	It	was	to	find	this	locket that	I	left	my	brother	and	came	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>JARVIS.	Then	my	work	now	is	to	find	your	brother	and	solve	the	mystery?	All right!	 We'll	 explain	 to	 the	 Duke	 that	 you	 are	 taking	 me	 to	 Spain	 for	 no	 other purpose	 than	 to	 solve	 the	 mystery.	 In	 America	 we've	 had	 trust-breakers	 and strike-breakers,	and	now	why	not	Jarvis,	the	Ghost	Breaker? </p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	 Why,	 yes,	 why	 not?	 Carlos	 would	 believe	 almost	 anything	 of	 you Americans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	( <i class="calibre4">Whimsically</i>)	And	you	will	tell	him	you	have	made	me	a—er—what is	it?	A	vassal? </p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	( <i class="calibre4">Almost	shyly</i>)	I	think	not—not	just	yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	 By	 the	 way,	 your—er—just	 how	 should	 a	 perfectly	 good	 vassal address	his	Princess? </p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	( <i class="calibre4">Hesitatingly</i>)	Highness—is	correct. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	Highness—tell	me,	your	Highness,	a	vassal	doesn't	amount	to	much, </p>
<p class="calibre1">does	he?	I	thought	he	was	a	piker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	( <i class="calibre4">Mystified</i>)	A	piker—a	man	who	carries	a	pike? </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	( <i class="calibre4">Trying	to	explain</i>)	No,	no—a	piker	is	a	tin	horn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	Tin	horn? </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	Well,	a	sort	of	pawn	in	this	game	of	chess—along	with	your	kings	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">queens	 and	 castles	 and	 things.	 ( <i class="calibre4">Seriously,	 yet	 playfully</i>)	 Could	 a	 good,	 hard-working,	reliable	vassal	work	his	way	up	to	be	a	Duke	or	a	Lord,	or	something like	that? </p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	 ( <i class="calibre4">Almost	 playing	 with	 him</i>)	 You're	 an	 ambitious	 vassal,	 aren't	 you? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm	afraid	you	wouldn't	be	content	with	being	anything	less	than	a	king. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	( <i class="calibre4">Meaningly</i>)	A	king—a	prince—or	a	bandit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	A	bandit?	And	why	a	bandit? </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	A	king	might	command—a	prince	request—a	bandit	seize. </p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	Seize	what? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>JARVIS.	( <i class="calibre4">Daringly</i>)	That	which	a	mere	vassal	can	only	admire.	( <i class="calibre4">Knock	at	door. </i></p>

<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	There	he	is	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	Hooray! </p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	What	shall	I	call	you? </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	 ( <i class="calibre4">Whispering</i>)	 Oh,	 any	 old	 thing—Warren,	 Mr.	 Warren.	 ( <i class="calibre4">Pause. </i></p>

<p class="calibre1">( <i class="calibre4">Enter</i>	DUKE.  <i class="calibre4">Stops	at	sight	of</i>	JARVIS.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">DUKE.	Oh,	I'm	intruding.	( <i class="calibre4">Spoken	as	though	he	expected</i>	JARVIS	 <i class="calibre4">to	go. </i>) PRINCESS.	 Allow	 me	 to	 present	 Mr.	 Warren,	 whom	 I	 am	 bringing	 from</p>
<p class="calibre1">America	 to	 solve	 the	 mystery	 of	 the	 castle.	 My	 cousin,	 Duke	 D'Alva.	 ( <i class="calibre4">She</i> <i class="calibre4">crosses</i>	L.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	( <i class="calibre4">Cross	to</i>	DUKE— <i class="calibre4">easily</i>)	Glad	to	know	You.	(PRINCESS	 <i class="calibre4">back</i>	R.) DUKE.	 ( <i class="calibre4">Patronizingly</i>)	 I	 am	 honored.	 Interesting	 task	 you	 have	 undertaken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">May	I	ask	if	that	is	your	regular	profession? </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	 That	 is	 my	 business,	 solving	 mysteries,	 looking	 up	 the	 family skeleton,	hunting	out	spooks.	What	we	call	in	America	a	Ghost	Breaker! </p>
<p class="calibre1">DUKE.	 Ghost	 Breaker?	 A	 strange	 calling.	 I	 indeed	 never	 heard	 of	 anything more	extraordinary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	 It	 is	 not	 surprising,	 your	 Excellency.	 We	 are	 living	 in	 an	 age	 of specialists—and	 like	 every	 other	 profession,	 this	 calls	 for	 its	 own	 peculiar training. </p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	( <i class="calibre4">Interrupting</i>)	I	am	so	glad	you	are	here,	cousin—you	will	be	able to	tell	Mr.	Warren,	so	much	better	than	I,	all	the	circumstances. </p>
<p class="calibre1">DUKE.	 I'll	 be	 delighted	 to	 throw	 any	 light	 I	 can	 on	 the	 mystery,	 but	 first	 tell me—( <i class="calibre4">To</i>	PRINCESS)—why	did	you	leave	your	brother	to	come	to	America? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>PRINCESS.	( <i class="calibre4">Takes	locket	from	reticule</i>)	This	little	locket	is	what	brought	me	to America. </p>
<p class="calibre1">DUKE.	( <i class="calibre4">Crosses	to	her,	holding	out	hand	to	take	it</i>)	May	I	see	it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	 ( <i class="calibre4">Takes	 out	 memo. </i>)	 No,	 Carlos,	 you	 may	 see	 the	 locket—no	 one must	see	the	memorandum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">DUKE.	Memorandum? </p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	Yes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	( <i class="calibre4">Seated	on	trunk—to</i>	DUKE)	A	wise	precaution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">DUKE.	( <i class="calibre4">Picking	up	locket</i>)	Curious	old	piece	of	work—and	you	came	all	the way	to	America	for	this? </p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	Yes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">DUKE.	You	were	very	fortunate	to	find	it	so	soon.	( <i class="calibre4">Cross</i>	R.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	I	knew	where	to	go	to	find	it—and	yet	I	was	nearly	too	late.	Think</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	it,	after	that	dear	old	locket	had	lain	in	an	antique	shop	for	ten	years,	suddenly in	one	day	there	came	two	inquiries	for	it.	(JARVIS	 <i class="calibre4">sits	looking	at</i>	CARLOS.)	Mine was	 the	 second.	 A	 distinguished-looking	 gentleman	 had	 been	 there	 in	 the morning,	described	it	roughly	to	the	old	man	and	got	him	to	hunt	for	it.	He	had just	 found	 it	 when	 I	 came	 in.	 I	 doubled	 the	 distinguished-looking	 gentleman's offer	and	got	it.	( <i class="calibre4">Another	look	at</i>	DUKE.)	Who	do	you	suppose	wanted	that	locket, Carlos? </p>
<p class="calibre1">DUKE.	(R.  <i class="calibre4">,	being	cornered	and	with	effort	to	throw	it	off	lightly</i>)	 I	 see	 that	 it has	 already	 occurred	 to	 you	 that	 I	 am	 the	 distinguished-looking	 gentleman whose	offer	you	doubled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	 ( <i class="calibre4">With	 curiosity</i>)	 But	 how	 did	 you	 learn	 about	 the	 memorandum, Carlos?	(JARVIS	 <i class="calibre4">sits	on	trunk. </i>)</p>
<p class="calibre1">DUKE.	 I	 didn't,	 Cousin.	 I	 had	 not	 the	 slightest	 suspicion	 that	 the	 locket contained	 the	 supposed	 secret.	 I	 was	 merely	 following	 my	 pet	 hobby,	 trying	 to recover	some	of	those	precious	heirlooms	which	have	been	scattered	to	the	four winds.	 ( <i class="calibre4">Quickly</i>)	 You	 would	 be	 surprised,	 Mr.	 Warren,	 to	 see	 the	 collection	 I have	already	rescued	and	which	some	day	may	be	yours,	Maria. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>JARVIS.	 ( <i class="calibre4">Breaking	 in	 impatiently</i>)	 Well,	 so	 much	 for	 the	 treasure.	 Now	 let's hear	about	the	ghost.	What's	your	opinion	of	this,	your	Excellency?	Do	you	put any	stock	in	ghosts? </p>
<p class="calibre1">DUKE.	Yes,	Mr.	Warren,	I	am	convinced	there	are	such	things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	You	believe	that	this	castle	is	haunted? </p>
<p class="calibre1">DUKE.	I	know	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	You	think	this	ghost	is	dangerous	to	encounter—that	it	is	the	cause	of the	deaths	and	disappearances	in	the	castle? </p>
<p class="calibre1">DUKE.	I	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	Well,	what	do	you	think	about	that?	Ghosts——	That's	a	pretty	broad</p>
<p class="calibre1">term,	your	Excellency.	Can	you	tell	me	just	what	you	believe	this	ghost	is? </p>
<p class="calibre1">DUKE.	There	are	certain	occult	forces	in	this	world,	Mr.	Warren,	that	science cannot	 fathom,	 and	 some	 of	 them	 are	 manifested	 in	 that	 castle	 now.	 A	 priest might	call	it	a	demon	or	a	fiend;	a	psychologist,	perhaps	a	returning	spirit.	I	can't say—but	 I	 know	 there	 is	 something	 real,	 a	 malignant	 force	 which	 lurks	 in	 that castle,	 and	 while	 it	 haunts	 those	 halls,	 it	 is	 madness	 for	 any	 man	 to	 expose himself	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	Have	you	ever	seen	this	ghost? </p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	My	brother	has. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	What? </p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	Twice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	Good	night! </p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	So	has	my	father,	and	the	others	when	they	disappeared.	No	one	has</p>
<p class="calibre1">seen	it	three	times	and	lived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	( <i class="calibre4">Interrupting	and	looking	at</i>	DUKE)	 In	 just	 what	 way	 do	 you	 connect this	spook	with	the	treasure? </p>
<p class="calibre1">DUKE.	Spook?	I	see	no	connection.	What	do	you	mean? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>JARVIS.	Oh,	there	is	always	money	where	the	ghost	walks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">DUKE.	 I	 don't	 know	 what	 your	 experience	 has	 been,	 Mr.	 Warren.	 You	 are evidently	a	brave	man—but	you	have	yet	to	encounter	a	real	ghost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	Brave!	It	takes	no	bravery	to	fight	a	coward.	That	is	what	this	ghost	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">—it's	a	coward	like	every	other	ghost.	I	tell	you	that	men	are	not	half	so	afraid	of spirits	 as	 spirits	 are	 afraid	 of	 men.	 Face	 the	 supernatural—and	 it	 is	 beaten	 to	 a frazzle	 before	 the	 fight	 begins.	 Spooks—horse-thieves—and	 peevish	 wild-cats can	all	be	tamed	by	the	same	little	charm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	( <i class="calibre4">Mystified</i>)	Charm? </p>
<p class="calibre1">DUKE.	( <i class="calibre4">Leaning	forward</i>)	What	is	it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	I'd	hate	to	tell	you.	It's	part	of	my	system.	( <i class="calibre4">Taking	out	pistol. </i>) DUKE.	( <i class="calibre4">Scornfully</i>)	I	had	been	hoping,	Mr.	Warren,	that	you	had	some	subtle method	of	handling	this	problem,	but	you	evidently	propose	to	meet	the	forces	of the	supernatural	with	firearms.	I—I	may	tell	you	that	this	specter	has	been	shot at	before	without	the	slightest	effect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	( <i class="calibre4">Smiling</i>)	Quite	likely,	your	Excellency.	I	have	seen	rifle	fire	that	had not	the	slightest	effect	on	a	wild-cat	for	the	very	reason	that	the	firing	was	wilder than	the	cat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">DUKE.	( <i class="calibre4">As	though	pitying	him</i>)	I	am	sorry	for	you	Mr.	Warren.	You	will	find the	ghost	more	real	than	the	treasure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	( <i class="calibre4">Rising</i>)	 But	 the	 treasure	 is	 real,	 Carlos.	 Would	 I	 have	 crossed	 the ocean	 for	 this	 locket	 unless	 I	 knew?	 Why,	 with	 this	 paper	 anybody—a	 total stranger—could	walk	right	up	to	the	very	stone	that	hides	it——</p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	 ( <i class="calibre4">Meaningly</i>)	 Pretty	 dangerous	 paper	 to	 have	 around.	 Look	 out somebody	does	not	get	there	ahead	of	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">DUKE.	( <i class="calibre4">Meaningly	to</i>	JARVIS)	Yes,	it	is	a	dangerous	paper—if	it	leads	anyone into	the	castle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	( <i class="calibre4">Laughingly</i>)	Well,	your	Excellency,	I'd	go	a	long	way	for	the	fun	of unravelling	a	good	mystery	with	a	little	spice	of	danger	thrown	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>DUKE.	 You	 needn't	 have	 gone	 so	 far,	 Mr.	 Warren.	 You	 are	 leaving	 a	 very unusual	case	behind	you	in	New	York.	The	papers	are	full	of	it.	Have	you	read them?	( <i class="calibre4">Picking	up	newspaper. </i>)	It	will	interest	you	too,	Cousin.	You	were	at	the Manhattan	last	night,	I	believe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">PRINCESS.	Yes!	(JARVIS	 <i class="calibre4">and</i>	PRINCESS	 <i class="calibre4">look	at	each	other	and</i>	DUKE	  <i class="calibre4">reads	 from</i> <i class="calibre4">newspaper. </i>)</p>
<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	Why,	no——	( <i class="calibre4">Glancing	at	trunk. </i>)	I	was	so	wrapped	up	in	my	baggage I	really	didn't	have	a	chance.	( <i class="calibre4">Looks	at</i>	PRINCESS.)</p>

<p class="calibre1">JARVIS.	( <i class="calibre4">Interrupting</i>)	He's	probably	a	long	way	from	the	hotel	by	this	time. </p>
