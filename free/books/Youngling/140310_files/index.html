<p class="calibre1">A	Terran	Empire	Story</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">by	Ann	Wilson</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Unnamed	world,	2559	CE</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Joste	was	waiting	in	front	of	his	desk	when	two	guards	brought	the just-captured	human	into	his	office.	He	found	it	hard	to	look	at	the	man without	becoming	physically	ill,	and	wondered	briefly	how	the	guards	could tolerate	touching	him.	Well,	that	was	their	job;	his	was	to	question	the	man, and	he	found	himself	hoping	the	foul	thing	would	resist,	give	him	an	excuse	to use	force. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">It	wasn’t	because	the	other	was	human,	or	because	he	was	an	enemy	—	Joste had	questioned	prisoners	before	without	having	had	the	slightest	desire	to	use physical	persuasion	—	and	the	man	looked	no	more	repulsive	than	any	other human.	Granted,	he	was	dirty	and	his	battledress	was	torn,	but	that	was	to	be expected	from	someone	who	had	been	in	combat.	And,	though	he	was	bound, the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p3"></a>man	held	himself	proudly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">No,	the	revulsion	wasn’t	caused	by	anything	so	straightforward.	It	was what	the	man	had	done	—	Joste’s	thoughts	shied	away	from	consideration	of such	obscenity,	and	he	had	to	force	them	back.	Simply	endangering	females without	dire	need	was	enough	to	earn	a	dishonorable	death;	they	were	so terribly	few,	less	than	a	fourth	of	the	Traiti	race,	cherished	for	themselves and	honored	for	the	young	only	they	could	bear	—	a	thing	that	happened	less often	than	any	could	wish. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">And	this	monster	had	actually	led	females	into	combat! </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">He	brought	himself	under	control;	the	grammar	and	harsh	sounds	of	Imperial English	were	difficult	enough	without	having	to	fight	emotion	at	the	same time.	“Yourself	identify,”	he	growled. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Major	Horst	Marguerre,	Imperial	Terran	Marine	Corps.”	It	didn’t	look at</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	good	for	him,	Marguerre	thought	grimly.	These	huge	gray-skinned humanoids</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	aggressive	as	hell	—	they	were	nicknamed	Sharks	as	much	for	that	as	for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p4"></a>the	facial	resemblance	—	and	this	one	looked	even	less	well-intentioned toward	him	than	his	guards	did.	“My	ident	code’s	TERHE6-2063-4121.	What’re you	doing	with	my	wounded?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“They	are	medical	treatment	receiving,”	Joste	said.	“Though	there	little chance	for	their	recovery	is,	the	physicians	their	best	doing	are.”	At	least, he	thought,	the	man	had	the	decency	to	show	concern	—	even	if	it	had	to	be false	concern	—	for	the	two	survivors	of	his	raiding	party,	both	of	whom	were female.	“What	your	purpose	was,	here	coming?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Marguerre	didn’t	know	what	caused	the	loathing	he	could	sense	from	the three	massive	Traiti,	but	it	was	intense	enough	to	frighten	him	in	spite	of almost	a	year’s	active	combat.	Still,	fear	or	no	fear,	he	wasn’t	about	to tell	them	what	they	wanted	to	know.	He	shook	his	head.	“Sorry,	that’s	all I’m	allowed	to	say.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he	winced	as	the	one	holding	his	shoulder	and	neck	tightened	that grip,	and	the	one	doing	the	questioning	started	to	smile.	This,	to	put	it mildly,	looked	less	and	less	like	it	was	going	to	be	a	friendly	party,	and	he was	suddenly	very	thankful	he’d	been	given	the	anti-interrogation	conditioning before	this	mission.	Not	that	he	intended	to	use	it	unless	he	had	no</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p5"></a>other	choice. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Good,	Joste	thought.	The	man	was	going	to	be	stubborn.	“You	mine	now are,	Major,	and	you	will	much	more	say.	When	you	have	enough	pain	had,	you will	to	me	gladly	speak.”	Slowly,	almost	luxuriously,	he	reached	for	the	man, extending	his	claws. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Marguerre	tasted	fear,	his	mouth	bitter-dry	as	he	watched	the	clawed	gray hand	approach.	He	remained	still,	though	he	could	feel	himself	going	pale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	expected	death	if	the	mission	failed,	but	not	like	this	—	not	being tortured	for	information	while	two	of	his	people	lay	badly	wounded	in	a	Traiti military	hospital.	He	knew	his	interrogator	was	right;	everyone	had	a breaking	point.	He	could	only	hope	they’d	kill	him	before	he	came	so	close	to his	own	that	he’d	have	to	activate	the	conditioning.	He	preferred	to	meet death	knowing	who	he	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">A	sudden	flashing	movement	of	Joste’s	claws	ripped	the	tough	material	of the	human’s	shirt	to	ribbons,	exposing	the	soft	undershirt.	A	single	claw took	care	of	that,	still	without	breaking	thin	human	skin.	“Why	did	you	here come?”	Joste	asked	softly.	“Now	say,	and	yourself	much	pain	save.	You	no honor	have	to	lose.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p6"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	what	the	hell	did	he	mean	by	that,	Marguerre	wondered.	Not	that	it really	mattered,	under	the	circumstances.	“Forget	it.	I’m	a	Marine,	not	a traitor.”	His	muscles	were	tensed	in	anticipation,	but	it	didn’t	help	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	gasped	and	flinched	anyway	when	the	claws	touched	his	flesh,	digging	in	and across,	drawing	blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Joste	was	fully	aware	of	human	frailty,	and	was	being	far	gentler	than	he cared	to,	but	he	was	still	startled	at	the	amount	of	blood	welling	from	such shallow	wounds.	He	would	have	to	be	even	more	careful;	if	he	weren’t,	this Marguerre	might	bleed	to	death	before	giving	him	the	information	he	needed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	might	be	best	to	use	fists	or	slaps	instead	of	claws	or	teeth,	at	least	for the	most	part,	until	the	time	came	to	execute	the	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?”	he	asked	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	to	hell,”	Marguerre	snarled. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“We	do	not	that	belief	hold,”	Joste	said	calmly.	“And	if	either	of	us	to such	a	place	going	is,	it	will	you	be.	I	have	never	a	female	to	her	death sent.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	I	have.	So?	Nobody	forced	them	to	join	the	Marines,	or	apply	for Special	Forces.	They	knew	what	they	were	getting	into.	Every	last	one	of them’s	a	volunteer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Joste	growled	in	disgust.	The	human	must	think	him	a	fool,	to	expect	him to	believe	such	nonsense!	The	only	time	a	female	fought	was	in	last-ditch defense	of	the	clan,	something	that	hadn’t	happened	since	the	clan	wars	almost four	thousand	years	ago.	“You	lie,	human.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Marguerre	shrugged,	awkwardly	because	of	his	bound	hands,	but	said	no more.	He’d	already	said	more	than	he	should	have;	he	knew	the	best	way	to avoid	giving	anything	away	by	accident	was	to	remain	silent	except	for	the required	identification	information. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Enough	of	that,”	Joste	said.	He’d	not	discuss	females	more	with	this perverted	filth.	“Now	you	will	me	truth	give.	Why	came	you	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	almost	dark,	and	Joste	was	becoming	discouraged.	The	man,	except</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>for	sounds	of	pain,	had	remained	silent.	He	was	sprawled	on	the	floor	now, naked	except	for	his	own	blood,	his	hands	no	longer	bound	because	he	no	longer had	hands	to	bind. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Yet	he	was	trying	to	rise,	had	actually	made	it	to	his	knees	with	his wrists	pressed	against	his	chest	and	his	head	bowed	to	hide	empty	eye	sockets, in	a	sickening	parody	of	one	paying	homage	to	the	Lords. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Marguerre	knew	he	was	done.	The	pain,	the	maiming,	were	too	much	…</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	his	tormentor	wasn’t	going	to	allow	him	to	die	by	accident.	He	had	to activate	the	conditioning	or	buy	his	death	with	the	information	the	Traiti wanted.	For	a	Marine,	that	was	no	real	choice	—	but	there	was	one	thing	he wanted	to	make	absolutely	clear	before	he	went	out.	“Joste	…	“</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Speak,	human.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“You	said	…	I’ve	got	no	honor.”	Marguerre	raised	his	head,	faced	the sound	of	Joste’s	voice.	“Maybe	not	…	your	kind,	I	don’t	know.	I’d	…</p>
<p class="calibre1">hoped	you’d	miscalculate	…	kill	me	clean	…	‘fore	it	came	to	this.	Now I	just	want	you	…	t’be	certain	…	I	do	know	what	I’m	doing.”	He straightened	as	much	as	he	was	able,	drew	in	breath,	and	forced	himself	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>speak	the	single	short	phrase	he’d	chosen.	Hearing	himself	say	it, deliberately,	would	wipe	out	Major	Horst	Marguerre. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Nonsense	syllables,	Joste	thought.	“‘Twas	brillig,	and	the	slithy	toves”? </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	space	of	seconds,	there	was	no	sound	—	then	Marguerre	collapsed with	the	heart-rending	wail	of	a	hurt,	terrified	youngling,	to	lie	sobbing brokenly	at	Joste’s	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Stunned,	the	interrogator	could	only	stare,	then	he	dropped	to	one	knee beside	the	bloody	form.	“Human	…	what	wrong	is?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	face	that	turned	toward	him	had	nothing	of	the	proud	Marine	in	it, only	pain	and	fear.	The	man	had	said	he	knew	what	he	was	doing	—	what	had	he done?	Whatever	it	was,	there	was	clearly	no	point	in	questioning	him	further. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	a	sigh,	Joste	picked	up	his	prisoner	and	stood. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Unbelievably,	that	seemed	to	comfort	the	man.	He	nestled	closer	to Joste’s	chest,	and	the	sobs	slowed	to	whimpers,	then	ceased.	His	breathing showed	he	had	gone	to	sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>Joste	and	the	guards	exchanged	amazed	glances.	“What	did	you	do	to	him, Group-Leader?”	the	younger	one	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	did	nothing,	Sedni.	What	has	happened	to	him	was	his	own	choice,	he said.	He	had	hoped	to	die	before	this	became	necessary.”	Joste	looked	down at	his	burden,	troubled	by	the	man’s	sudden	change.	“He	resisted	me	with	all his	will,	yet	now	he	clings	to	me	for	comfort,	as	a	newborn	clings	to	its mother.	He	seems	not	to	know	me	any	longer,	perhaps	not	to	know	himself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“As	one	who	has	lost	all	memory?”	the	older	guard	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	…	not	lost,”	Joste	said	slowly.	“He	told	me	he	knew	what	he was	doing,	and	I	believe	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“What,	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	cannot	be	sure	yet	…	but	he	fought	me	as	well	as	he	was	able, though	he	must	have	known	he	had	no	way	to	win,	and	I	denied	him	the	escape of</p>
<p class="calibre1">death.	Had	he	lacked	honor	as	I	thought,	he	would	have	spoken	in	an	effort	to live	—	but	he	did	not.”	Joste	hesitated.	He	had	underestimated	the	man; </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>perhaps	Marguerre	had	spoken	the	truth	earlier.	Perhaps	he	had	truly	felt	no dishonor	in	leading	females	into	combat	—	a	thing	that	was	difficult	to believe,	but	so	was	his	sudden	change	from	a	defiant	Marine	to	a	sobbing	…</p>
<p class="calibre1">what?	“Not	lost,”	Joste	repeated	thoughtfully.	“Far	worse,	if	what	I	begin	to suspect	is	true.	It	would	appear	that	he	destroyed	his	mind	rather	than betray	his	people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	even	a	human	would	go	that	far!”	Sedni	exclaimed,	his	voice	shaken. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	would	prefer	a	more	acceptable	idea	myself,”	Joste	said.	Death	came	to everyone,	soon	or	late;	in	the	long	run,	it	was	unavoidable,	and	at	times	a self-inflicted	death	was	the	only	way	to	preserve	honor	—	far	preferable	to the	alternative	of	living	dishonored.	The	idea	of	someone	destroying	his	own mind,	though	—	even	for	the	same	purpose	—	was	one	that	made	the	Traiti interrogator	recoil.	Still,	at	this	point	it	was	only	a	possibility,	not	a certainty.	Joste	glanced	at	the	human	again,	then	began	giving	orders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Chorvak,	call	the	hospital	and	tell	them	I’m	bringing	in	an	emergency patient.	And	find	out	if	either	of	the	females	survived	and	is	able	to	talk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sedni,	go	to	Communications	and	have	them	stand	by	for	a	possible	priority call	to	N’chark	clanhome	on	Norvis.	I	may	need	to	talk	to	Ka’ruchaya Jarna.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">Both	saluted,	and	Sedni	left	while	Chorvak	went	to	Joste’s	desk	to	make the	call.	The	interrogator	left	as	well,	carrying	the	sleeping	human. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Within	minutes	he	had	covered	the	short	distance	to	the	hospital	and	was putting	the	mangled	man	on	an	emergency	surgical	table.	Marguerre	seemed	to partially	awaken	when	Joste	put	him	down,	whimpering	softly	until	the	duty surgeon	gave	him	a	sedative. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	wrong	with	him?”	the	surgeon	asked.	“Aside	from	the	obvious,	I mean.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	not	certain,”	Joste	told	him.	“I	am	not	even	sure	I	really	want	to know,	but	I	must	check.	Give	him	support	treatment	until	I	can,	please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Chorvak	was	waiting	when	Joste	left	the	surgery.	“The	tiny	dark-skinned female	is	dead,	Group-Leader,”	he	reported,	“but	the	bigger	pale	one’s injuries	were	less	serious	than	the	physicians	originally	thought;	she	is alive	and	regaining	consciousness.	They	will	allow	you	to	speak	to	her	as</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>long	as	you	keep	it	brief	and	do	not	excite	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	Chorvak.	I	will	be	careful.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	hospital	was	small,	so	it	didn’t	take	long	for	the	two	to	get	to	the room	assigned	to	the	human	woman.	Joste	went	in	alone,	took	a	seat	by	her bed.	“Ka’naya	Marine,	may	I	with	you	speak?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh?”	She	looked	at	him,	clearly	still	groggy	and	trying	to	focus.	“Wha’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘bout?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Joste	puzzled	over	that	momentarily,	then	he	figured	out	the	slurred words.	“About	Major	Horst	Marguerre,	ka’naya.	When	I	was	him	questioning, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	said	that	did	not	English	seem,	a	code	of	some	sort,	I	think.	Then he	cried	out,	and	like	a	youngling	wept.	Can	you	me	tell,	what	to	him happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">She	seemed	to	rouse	at	Marguerre’s	name.	“Something	not	English?	But	he doesn’t	know	any	other	language	—	”	Then	her	eyes	widened,	and	she	looked sick.	“Blood	…	is	it	his?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">Joste’s	silence	answered	her.	Tears	leaked	out	of	her	eyes	and	she	swore tiredly.	“Damn	you,	you	bastard	Shark.	What’d	you	do	to	break	him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Ask	me	that	not,	ka’naya.	The	answer	would	only	you	distress,	and	he	is help	now	getting.	But	I	must	know,	when	he	those	strange	words	said,	what	he by	them	meant.	What	they	to	him	did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	I’d	rather	not	know,	at	that.”	She	scowled.	“What’ll	you	do	to him	if	I	tell	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“If	it	what	I	fear	is,	I	will	my	Ka’ruchaya	—	you	have	not	the	term, female	parent	to	the	clan	—	ask,	him	to	adopt.	N’chark	will	for	him	care.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Clan	mother.	But	he’s	human	—	why	would	you	do	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“He	something	to	himself	did,	that	him	into	the	likeness	of	a	youngling turned.	If	that	likeness	a	true	one	is,	then	he	must	a	youngling’s	safety	and guidance	given	be.”	He	paused	for	a	moment.	“And	it	my	opinion	is,	that	what he	did	was	from	honor	done.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>“It	was.	I’m	not	sure	I	believe	you,	but	telling	you	what	happened	can’t make	it	any	worse	for	him.	Okay,	you’re	right.	The	words	themselves’re meaningless,	they	were	only	triggers	for	anti-interrogation	conditioning,	a total	mind-wipe.	Didn’t	bother	anything	else,	like	intelligence,	just	memory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	a	new	technique,	but	a	lot	of	us	already	have	it	…	”	She	turned	her head	away	briefly,	then	went	on.	“You	could	say	he	has	the	mind	of	a	newborn child	in	an	adult	body.	Who	was	the	first	person	he	saw	after	he	…</p>
<p class="calibre1">blanked	out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“He	has	no	one	seen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	guess	why.”	She	grimaced.	“Damn.	Okay,	who	was	the	first	one	he heard?	If	he	can	still	hear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“He	can,	ka’naya.	And	I	the	first	was.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">She	gave	him	a	mocking	grin.	“Hi,	Daddy.	If	the	psychs	were	right,	he’s fixated	on	you,	now.	How	do	you	feel	about	taking	care	of	babies?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">In	spite	of	the	dismay	he	felt	at	her	confirmation	of	his	worst	suspicion, Joste	couldn’t	help	a	smile.	“Ka’naya	Marine,	I	have	only	once	the	joy	had, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>of	sharing	young.	Say	you	he	will	truly	me	as	es’chaya	see?	Male	parent?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Father?”	The	Marine’s	grin	softened	into	an	answering	smile	at	his obvious	sincerity.	“Not	exactly.	That,	yes,	but	more.	He’s	your	child	—</p>
<p class="calibre1">yours	alone	—	unless	he	heard	someone	else	about	the	same	time	he	heard	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“There	no	one	was,	ka’naya.	He	in	my	arms	asleep	was,	before	another spoke.	I	your	leave	to	go	must	ask;	I	should	Ka’ruchaya	Jarna	call.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	worried.	“Okay,	I	guess	you	will	take	care	of	Major	Marguerre. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	what’ll	happen	to	me?	So	far	I’ve	been	treated	all	right,	but	I’m	afraid that	won’t	—	“</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Ka’naya!”	Joste	interrupted,	horrified	by	what	she	was	implying.	“You need	nothing	fear.	You	will	guarded	be,	of	course,	but	no	harm	will	to	you come!	We	not	like	humans	twisted	are,	a	female	to	hurt	without	great	need.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">As	her	expression	began	to	show	relief,	Joste	gave	her	a	courteous	salute and	left	for	the	Communications	section.	Sedni	wasn’t	the	only	one	waiting there	for	him;	so	was	his	commander,	Senior	Group-Leader	Kunnos. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>“Sedni	briefed	me,”	Kunnos	said.	“May	I	listen	to	your	call?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course,	Group-Leader.”	It	wasn’t	usually	‘of	course,’	but	Joste	had served	under	Kunnos	for	a	long	time,	long	enough	to	trust	his	discretion	even in	N’chark’s	clan	matters. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Clan	priority	traffic	got	the	same	treatment	as	military	communications, so	it	didn’t	take	long	for	the	operator	to	make	ultrawave	contact	with N’chark	clanhome,	then	leave	to	join	Sedni.	Nor	did	it	take	long,	once contact	was	made,	for	Ka’ruchaya	Jarna	to	appear	on	the	comscreen.	Joste greeted	her	formally,	crossing	arms	over	his	chest	and	inclining	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kunnos	followed	suit,	bowing	more	deeply	as	befit	an	out-clan	male. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Jarna	acknowledged	the	greeting,	then	looked	curiously	at	Joste. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ruesten,	you	have	won	the	Honor	scars;	what	problem	can	you	have	so serious	that	it	requires	my	intervention?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Ka’ruchaya,	it	is	a	matter	of	adoption.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	I	see.	Go	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>Joste	did	as	he	was	told,	describing	the	human’s	torment,	memory	loss,	and what	the	female	Marine	had	told	him.	“Maybe	he	was	being	honest	when	he	said the	females	volunteered	for	combat.	Certainly	the	one	I	spoke	to	showed	pain at	his	hurt.	And	he	did	prove	himself	honorable,	sacrificing	his	mind	—</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself	—	as	he	did.	Ka’ruchaya,	he	needs	help,	and	I	think	that	once	he learns	our	ways,	he	will	be	a	credit	to	N’chark.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“He	lost	only	his	memory?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	Ka’ruchaya,	according	to	the	female	Marine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“And	she	called	him	your	‘child,’	your	esten.”	Jarna	paused,	thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	Cor’naya	Joste.	Under	the	circumstances,	I	do	not	think	adoption	either possible	or	necessary;	he	cannot	take	the	blood-oath	if	he	cannot	understand it.	He	is	a	Terran,	and	apparently	newborn	by	their	ways,	regarding	you	as chaya.	I	accept	him	as	es’ruesten,	a	clan-son	of	N’chark	by	birth.	Care	for him,	see	that	he	gets	the	medical	help	he	needs	—	including	regrowth treatments	if	they	are	available	there	—	and	bring	him	home	as	soon	as	he	is able	to	travel.	If	you	wish,	I	will	arrange	for	his	naming	ceremony.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	Ka’ruchaya.	Let	him	be	named	Horst,	of	Clan	N’chark.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	be	it,	Cor’naya	Joste.”	Jarna	turned	to	Kunnos.	“I	will	send	a	ship for	them,	Group-Leader.	Will	you	need	a	linguist	to	replace	Joste?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you	please,	Ka’ruchaya.	Stanek,	if	he	has	recovered.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“He	will	be	on	the	ship.”	Jarna’s	expression	became	grim.	“But	hear	my words,	Group-Leader:	none	of	my	n’ruesten	will	force	another	to	this	living self-destruction	again.	I	will	not	have	them	dishonor	themselves	so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	would	not	ask	it,	Ka’ruchaya,”	Kunnos	said.	“I	will	report	this	to	the Supreme,	with	the	recommendation	that	he	order	any	found	to	have	similar conditioning	questioned	no	further.”	He	extended	claws	to	emphasize	his determination.	“I	have	no	wish	to	be	part	of	such	dishonor,	either.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Well	said,	Group-Leader.”	Jarna	inclined	her	head.	“Now	if	you	will excuse	me,	I	must	return	to	my	duties.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	two	males	bowed,	then	when	the	screen	cleared,	left	the	Communications section.	Joste	made	his	way	back	to	the	hospital	to	check	on	his	child, wondering	at	the	Lords’	ordering	of	things.	The	human	and	he	had	met	as</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>enemies,	and	Joste	had	taken	angry	pleasure	in	his	torment.	But	now	Horst	was of	N’chark,	he	would	be	raised	as	such	…	and	this	time,	Joste	vowed,	Horst would	be	raised	with	a	proper	respect	for	females	and	younglings. </p>
