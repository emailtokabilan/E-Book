<p class="calibre1">‘Twenty-six	thousand,’	Harry	said.	‘Gotta	spend	it	to	make	it.’	He	stretched yellow	bands	around	two	stacks	of	bills	and	laid	one	stack	on	the	seat	next	to Charley.	‘Give	them	half	before	I	check	the	load.	Calms	them	down.’	He	looked at	his	watch.	‘High	tide.	Getting	dark.	Perfect.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Won’t	be	any	diggers	around,’	Charley	said,	slowing	the	truck	and	easing	over	a slab	of	ledge	rock.	There	was	just	enough	room	to	turn	around	under	a	stand	of pines.	He	shut	off	the	engine,	shoved	the	money	into	his	back	pocket,	and	got out.	Brunswick	jumped	to	the	ground,	sniffed	a	few	trees,	marked	one,	and trotted	onto	the	decaying	dock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘So	far,	so	good,’	Charley	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	leaned	against	the	truck.	‘Easy	money	for	you,	my	man.	After	you	unload, don’t	be	hanging	around.	In	and	out.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Back	in	time	for	breakfast,’	Charley	said.	Blueberry	pancakes,	a	fine	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Take	a	little	weed	for	yourself—recreational—not	enough	to	go	into	business.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Couple	of	bales	should	do	it,’	Charley	said.	Harry	got	in	your	hair	like	a	deerfly; you	had	to	keep	brushing	him	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brunswick	stiffened,	looking	toward	the	mouth	of	the	cove.	The	sound	of	a diesel	carried	in	on	the	evening	sea	breeze	and	became	more	distinct.	A	fishing boat	rounded	the	point	and	felt	its	way	slowly	up	the	channel,	dark	against	the silvery	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	aimed	a	flashlight	and	signaled	three	times.	Three	answering	flashes	came from	the	wheelhouse.	Harry	blinked	his	light	three	times	again	and	waved.	A man	on	the	stern	waved	back.	Charley	went	down	to	the	water	to	take	a	line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	blinding	light	came	from	the	wrong	direction.	‘FREEZE!	You’re	under	arrest! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hold	it	right	there!’	Brunswick	charged,	barking.	‘GET	DOWN,	Goddamnit!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Charley	dove	for	the	water,	heard	shots,	more	yelling.	He	swam	underwater	as</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p6"></a>far	as	he	could,	took	a	quick	breath,	and	went	under	again,	heading	for	an outcrop	of	spruce.	A	powerful	engine	surged	into	the	cove,	trapping	the	delivery boat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Charley	stayed	close	to	shore,	surfacing	only	for	air.	It	was	almost	dark.	He	had a	chance	if	they	didn’t	have	dogs.	Brunswick	probably	would	have	sensed	dogs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	must	have	come	earlier,	through	the	woods	from	the	head	of	the	cove. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	shouting	stopped.	They	were	listening	for	him.	Harry	was	caught.	The	boat guys	were	caught.	If	he	came	ashore	where	he	was,	they’d	hear	him.	He	had	to get	farther	down	the	shore	before	they	came	after	him	in	the	boat.	He	swam silently	underwater.	The	tide	was	beginning	to	run,	helping	him.	He	made another	two	hundred	yards	before	the	big	engine	revved.	He	came	out	of	the water	on	his	hands	and	knees	and	crawled	into	the	underbrush	as	quickly	as	he could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	boat	passed	by,	shining	a	powerful	light	on	the	water	and	shore.	They weren’t	going	to	get	him	in	the	dark	without	dogs.	He	had	until	morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	they	knew	about	the	buy,	they	might	know	about	him.	Someone	local	could have	recognized	him.	No	going	home.	Shit.	Ginny.	They’d	be	after	her,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Better	stay	away.	Harry’s	money	was	still	in	his	pocket,	a	soggy	block.	They’d send	him	to	Thomaston	for	years,	probably.	No	way.	It	was	either	run	for	it	now or	lie	low	and	run	later.	Sometimes	you	had	to	be	patient.	Let	the	game	come	to you,	he	could	hear	his	coach	saying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	moved	quietly	away	from	the	cove,	waving	off	mosquitoes.	His	shirt	began to	dry,	but	his	jeans	were	wet	and	heavy.	Rafer’s	house	was	four	miles	down	the main	road.	He	could	wait	in	the	woods	until	Rafer	went	to	work	and	then	maybe borrow	some	stuff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	hour	later	he	emerged	from	the	trees	and	started	walking	on	the	road,	ready to	run	back	into	the	woods.	It	didn’t	feel	right.	The	cops	might	be	waiting	with their	lights	off;	they	knew	he	was	somewhere	close.	He	decided	to	stay	hidden and	wait	for	first	light.	He	curled	up	under	a	pine	about	fifty	yards	back	from	the road	and	tried	to	rest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	stupid	to	have	made	those	runs	for	Harry.	It	had	seemed	like	a	joke.	Don’t think	about	it,	he	told	himself.	Stay	focused.	He	had	to	get	away,	stay	free,	stay alive.	The	certainty	of	this	steadied	him,	and	the	hours	passed,	slowly	and	then</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a>faster	as	he	listened	to	small	noises	in	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	dawn,	he	started	through	the	woods,	staying	thirty	yards	from	the	road.	He crossed	a	number	of	driveways	and	smaller	roads.	Dogs	barked,	but	no	one	saw him.	Rafer’s	truck	was	in	front	of	his	house.	He	waited	out	of	sight	until	he heard	the	truck	start	and	drive	down	the	road.	Gus,	Rafer’s	lab,	barked	as	he came	out	of	the	woods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Gus,	Gus,	good	dog.	Good	dog,	Gus.’	He	eased	open	the	porch	door	and	let	the dog	sniff	his	hand.	‘Good	Gus.’	It	felt	good	to	talk,	to	hear	his	own	voice.	He entered	the	house	and	quickly	gathered	a	razor,	Avon	Skin-So-Soft	for	the	bugs, a	loaf	of	bread,	cheese,	and	a	bottle	of	water.	He	took	a	blanket	and	cut	a	length from	a	clothes	line	on	the	porch.	He	left	a	hundred	dollar	bill	in	the	cheese drawer.	No	note.	Nothing	to	get	Rafer	involved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	way	out,	he	grabbed	a	black	baseball	cap	from	a	shelf	by	the	door.	As soon	as	he	was	in	the	woods,	he	rubbed	the	Avon	on	his	neck	and	face	and	ate half	the	bread	and	cheese.	He	drank	most	of	the	water	and	would	have	gone	back for	more,	but	it	felt	like	the	wrong	direction.	He	rolled	everything	in	the	blanket and	tied	the	ends,	making	a	rough	pack	that	he	slung	over	one	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rafer	would	keep	his	mouth	shut.	No	problem	there.	Ginny’s	phone	might	be tapped.	When	he	could,	he’d	call	somebody	else,	maybe	Darlene,	and	ask	her	to give	a	message	to	Ginny.	Tell	her	he	was	out	of	there.	Tell	her	to	find	someone else,	have	some	kids,	get	a	life.	Truth	was,	she	ought	to	do	that	anyway.	It	was more	out	of	habit	than	anything	else	that	they	were	still	together.	High	school was	the	good	time,	but	that	was—what?—five	years	ago.	He	began	to	feel	bad, lonely,	but	he	pushed	the	hurt	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	walked	for	an	hour,	found	a	sunny	spot,	and	slept	most	of	the	day.	By	dark, he	was	behind	the	Quik	Stop,	waiting	for	it	to	close.	Fred	finally	turned	off	the lights	and	drove	away.	Charley	waited	five	more	minutes,	before	he	went	around to	the	pay	phone	by	the	front	door.	He	was	taking	a	chance,	but	he	could	see	car lights	coming	before	they	got	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Darlene	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Darlene,	this	is	Charley.	I	haven’t	got	much	time.	When	you	see	Ginny	would you	give	her	a	message?’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>‘Charley?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Tell	her	something	came	up.	She’ll	hear	about	it.	I’ve	got	to	get	out	of	here.	Tell her	have	some	kids,	have	a	decent	life.	We	had	some	good	times	but	it’s	all	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thanks,	Darlene.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Charley?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Gotta	run.	Take	care	of	that	sweet	ass	of	yours.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Charley,	wait!	You	want	a	ride’	The	cops	are	all	over	the	place.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	surprised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	don’t	want	to	get	you	in	trouble,	Darlene.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	can	hide	under	some	stuff	in	the	back	of	the	truck.	If	we	get	caught,	I’ll	say you	forced	me.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Jesus,	I	don’t	know.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Where	are	you?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">He	made	up	his	mind.	‘At	the	Quik	Stop.	You	sure?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Shit,	Charley.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘O.K.	I’ll	be	in	the	woods	just	past	the	big	curve.	If	anybody’s	around,	keep going	and	turn	around.	Just	pull	over.	I’ll	jump	in	back	and	lie	down.	We	can take	the	ridge	road,	by	Valda’s;	there	won’t	be	cops	up	that	way.	Figure	out where	to	go	from	there.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Half	an	hour,’	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Thanks,	Darlene.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">He	walked	quickly	down	the	road	and	crossed	to	be	on	the	right	side.	He	put	the blanket	roll	behind	a	maple	and	waited	where	he	could	crouch	out	of	sight	if	a car	came.	Four	cars	passed	before	Darlene’s	white	Chevy	slowed	to	a	stop.	He picked	up	the	blanket,	threw	it	in	back,	and	jumped	in	after.	There	was	a	tarp folded	in	the	bottom.	Darlene	was	turned,	looking	at	him	through	the	rear</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>window.	He	smiled,	banged	twice	on	the	glass,	and	lay	down,	spreading	the	tarp over	him	and	putting	the	blanket	under	his	head.	She	took	off	up	the	road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Damn	near	comfortable,	he	thought.	It	was	great	to	be	moving.	No	more	bugs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	lay	there,	rolling	a	little	with	the	curves,	tensing	when	Darlene	got	to	the	stop sign	on	Route	1	and	crossed	over.	She	took	back	roads	to	Valda’s,	shifted	down, and	headed	up	the	long	hill.	On	top,	she	bounced	along	for	five	minutes	and pulled	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Hot	damn,’	Charley	said,	coming	out	from	under	the	tarp	and	swinging	down	to the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Gotta	get	you	out	of	here!’	She	seemed	pleased	in	the	dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	guess.	Can’t	go	to	Portland.	I’m	afraid	of	the	Boston	bus	station.	I	don’t	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Worcester,	maybe.	I	doubt	they’d	be	over	there.	When	do	you	have	to	be	back?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Lunch	shift	tomorrow.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	up	for	Worcester?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Why	not’	Had	the	day	off,	didn’t	do	anything.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘How	about	we	go	over	to	New	Hampshire	the	back	way,	then	head	south?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘O.K.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	stay	down	until	we	get	to	a	diner	somewhere	out	of	state.	Then	maybe	you could	get	us	something	to	eat.	How’s	the	gas?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Half,	three	quarters.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Good	deal.’	He	climbed	back	into	the	truck.	‘You’re	a	princess.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Charley	had	eaten	the	rest	of	his	food	earlier;	he	was	hungry	when	Darlene stopped	outside	of	North	Conway.	He	handed	her	one	of	Harry’s	bills.	‘One	of everything	and	whatever	you	want.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Big	spender.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Maybe	a	western	sandwich	and	a	roast	beef	sandwich,	mayo,	the	works.	Large</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>coffee,	regular.	I’d	better	stay	out	here.	I	think	I	can	ride	up	front,	though.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What	about	pie?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yeah,	pie.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Darlene	bounced	through	the	door.	She	looked	free,	not	hung	up	at	all	about harboring	a	fugitive	or	whatever	she	was	doing.	She	was	a	year	behind	him	and Ginny	in	school,	on	the	chubby	side,	good	natured.	He	hadn’t	paid	much attention	to	her.	A	lot	of	the	girls	put	on	weight	after	graduation.	She’d	lost some.	Looked	better,	actually.	Probably	working	all	those	shifts	at	Jack’s.	She had	that	straight	scar	that	ran	past	the	corner	of	her	mouth,	made	her	look serious.	When	she	smiled,	the	scar	was	like	an	elevator	going	up,	and	she seemed	twice	as	cheerful.	Kicked	by	a	skate	when	she	was	little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Darlene	shouldered	her	way	outside	with	a	bag	under	her	arm	and	a	cup	in	each hand.	He	leaned	over	and	opened	the	door.	He	took	the	cups	and	straightened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Smells	good.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">She	got	in	and	opened	the	bag.	‘Which	one	you	want	first?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Western.’	He	ate	half	of	it	in	two	bites	and	took	a	long	swallow	of	coffee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Finest	kind!	Damn,	I’m	hungry.’	He	took	another	bite.	‘What	did	you	get?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Red	beans	and	rice,	chef’s	salad.’	She	reached	into	the	pocket	of	her	blouse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Here’s	the	change.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	better	keep	that.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	don’t	want	your	money,	Charley.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Shit,	Darlene—at	least	take	it	for	gas,	the	truck,	and	stuff.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	got	enough	to	get	on?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Plenty.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘All	right.’	She	put	the	money	in	her	wallet.	‘I	don’t	want	to	feel	bought,	is	all.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No	way,’	Charley	said,	relieved.	‘You	know,	maybe	you	shouldn’t	say	anything</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>to	Ginny	right	away,	maybe	let	the	cops	get	off	her	back.	I	could	give	you	a	note. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	could	say	you	found	it	under	the	door.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	just	wait	‘til	no	one’s	around	and	tell	her.	She	won’t	say	anything.	Not Ginny.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘It’s	crazy,’	he	said.	‘Who	gives	a	shit	about	a	couple	of	joints?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	heard	you	were	buying	a	boat	load.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	guess	that’s	what	pisses	them	off.’	He	bit	into	the	roast	beef.	‘Making	money off	it.	No	taxes.	It	was	a	dumb	idea,	though.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What	are	you	going	to	do?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Don’t	know.	But	I’m	not	going	to	Thomaston—not	unless	they	catch	me.	We get	to	Worcester,	I’ll	take	a	bus	somewhere,	I	guess.	Pie’s	a	little	gooey.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Canned	apples,’	she	said,	‘some	kind	of	sin	in	September.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Not	too	bad,	though,’	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	three	in	the	morning	when	they	stopped	outside	a	Howard	Johnson’s	in Worcester,	too	late	to	rent	a	room.	They	dozed	in	the	cab	until	the	first	gray	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’d	been	in	a	good	mood	driving	down,	talking	about	the	old	days,	but	they weren’t	smiling	when	they	woke	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘The	bus	station	isn’t	far,	might	as	well	get	out	here.’	He	went	around	and	pulled his	blanket	roll	from	the	back.	He	wanted	to	give	her	more	money,	but	he	knew she	wouldn’t	take	it.	Darlene	came	to	him	and	hugged	him	hard.	She	pulled	her head	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Could	I	have	a	kiss?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	mouths	met,	awkwardly	and	then	firmly,	saying	hello	and	goodbye	in	a long	honest	meeting.	‘I	always	wanted	to	kiss	you,	Charley,’	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yeah,’	he	said.	‘You	take	care	of	yourself.’	He	shook	his	head.	He	could	get used	to	kisses	like	that.	‘Getting	light.	You	don’t	want	to	be	seen	with	me.’	He stepped	back	and	put	the	blanket	roll	over	his	shoulder.	‘Getting	attached	to	this</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>thing.’	He	raised	one	hand.	‘Thanks,	Darlene.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	tears	rolled	down	her	cheeks.	“Bye,	Charley.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You’re	a	beauty,’	he	said	and	turned	away.	He	walked	around	the	corner	and stopped,	listening	for	the	sound	of	her	truck.	He	heard	her	start	it,	back	it	around, and	drive	in	the	other	direction.	The	sound	echoed	and	died	away.	He	was	weak in	the	knees.	If	she	had	followed	him,	he	didn’t	know	what	he	would	have	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Probably	would	have	ended	up	in	some	motel	and	wrecked	her	life,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a><b class="calibre3">2</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Brunswick	attacked	and	Charley	dove	for	the	water,	Harry	put	his	hands in	the	air.	The	guys	on	the	boat	looked	at	each	other.	A	shot.	Two	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brunswick	yelped	and	fell	on	his	side,	arterial	blood	arcing	from	his	throat.	The cops	were	on	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cuffed.	Shoved	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cursing	in	Spanish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	boat.	Lights	on	the	water,	looking	for	Charley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	weren’t	getting	Charley	who	seemed	to	have	turned	into	some	kind	of otter.	Otter	resists	arrest.	Going	to	be	the	worse	for	him.	Me,	I’m	a	kid.	Twenty-five.	Don’t	know	any	better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘It’s	just	grass,’	he	said,	‘hold	the	cannons.’	They	recited	his	Miranda	rights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ride	to	the	police	station	was	uncomfortable	and	disorienting,	filled	with loud	messages	to	and	from	the	dispatcher. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Your	new	address,’	the	cop	said,	opening	the	cruiser	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘10-4,’	Harry	said.	For	the	mug	shot,	he	produced	an	innocent,	there	must	be some	mistake,	smile.	How	was	he	going	to	tell	his	mother’</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	morning,	Jack	Eagleton,	the	family	lawyer,	got	him	out	on	bail	and	drove him	home	to	Falmouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	sorry,	Mother.	I	got	caught	trying	to	buy	some	grass—marijuana.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Marijuana,	really!	I	don’t	understand.	For	money’	Why	couldn’t	you	just	rip people	off	on	Wall	Street	like	your	father?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	think	I	should	rip	off	Father?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">She	rolled	her	eyes.	‘You	aren’t	going	to	be	joking	if	you	have	to	go	to	jail.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>‘Mother,	I’m	not	going	to	jail.	Jack	knows	what	he’s	doing.	It’s	not	like	I	shot anybody.	We	weren’t	even	armed.	It’s	a	harmless	substance	with	medicinal properties—probably	be	legal	when	they	figure	out	how	to	tax	it.	It’s	a	stupid law.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘But	it	is	a	law.	And	you	broke	it.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Mmm—true.	Jack	is	waiting	outside.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yes,	of	course,	bring	him	in.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">After	the	niceties	had	been	observed,	Jack	suggested	that	Harry	had	been	naïve, was	over	his	head.	‘You	have	a	clean	record.	One	of	the	guys	on	the	boat	is wanted	in	Florida.	The	Columbian	has	no	papers.	Charles	Walker	has	one	O.U.I. </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	is	on	probation	for	possession.	I	think	it	best	to	state	that	you	happened	to	be there	in	case	more	money	was	needed.	Charles	Walker	was	in	charge.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Do	you	like	a	joint	now	and	then,	Jack?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Attorneys	don’t	break	the	law,	Harry.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	burst	out	laughing.	‘Right,	yup,	that	was	my	mistake—listening	to Charley.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	wrote	on	his	pad	and	looked	at	Harry’s	mother.	‘I	was	going	to	delay, Elizabeth,	but	I	think	not.	I	think	it	best	to	move	this	along.	There	may	be—</p>
<p class="calibre1">confusion—when	Charles	Walker	is	caught.	Perhaps	that	will	take	some	time.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Masterminds	are	slippery,’	Harry	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Would	you	care	for	more	coffee,	Jack?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No,	thank	you,	Elizabeth.’	He	slid	his	pad	into	a	leather	case.	‘I’ll	have	a statement	Monday	for	your	approval.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Thank	you	so	much.	I’m	so	grateful.	We	would	be	lost	without	you.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">They	stood.	Harry	walked	over	to	Jack	and	shook	hands.	He	had	an	urge	to	brush the	croissant	flakes	from	Jack’s	lapel,	but	he	didn’t.	The	situation	was	getting more	serious.	Blaming	Charley	should	help	in	the	short	run,	but	there	would	be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>problems	down	the	road.	And	he	didn’t	feel	good	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Thanks,	Jack.	Mother.’	He	went	outside,	taking	a	suede	shirt-jacket	from	a	peg in	the	hall	closet.	He	needed	to	walk	and	think	things	over.	Then	maybe	see Lynn. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a><b class="calibre3">3</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Charley	found	a	diner	near	the	bus	terminal	and	ordered	pancakes.	The	blanket roll	was	doubled	in	front	of	his	feet.	He	looked	at	his	plate	and	tried	not	to scratch	his	three	day	beard—just	another	morning	in	Worcester.	Most	of	the customers	were	still	waking	up	or	hungover.	No	one	stared	at	him,	but	he	felt like	a	face	on	a	poster.	Coffee	helped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	patrol	car	passed	him	as	he	walked	to	the	terminal.	He	kept	his	eyes	on	the sidewalk.	The	cops	kept	going. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside	the	terminal	he	washed	his	face	and	shaved.	He	folded	the	blanket	into	a square	with	the	rope	and	the	razor	inside,	and	bought	a	ticket	to	New	York, feeling	less	conspicuous.	The	bus	left	half	an	hour	later,	and	he	slept	all	the	way to	the	city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	bright	and	clear	when	he	walked	out	of	the	Port	Authority	bus	station	onto a	crowded	sidewalk.	He	found	a	sporting	goods	store	and	bought	a	day	pack,	sun glasses,	and	a	travel	toothbrush.	He	bought	a	shirt,	jeans,	underwear,	and	socks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	changed	into	clean	clothes	and	had	his	hair	cut	short.	He	thought	about buying	another	hat,	but	things	were	happening	too	fast.	Rafer’s	hat	fit.	He needed	to	hang	on	to	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	tired	but	still	pumped	up.	He	wandered	along	Broadway	and	Columbus avenues	feeling	not	too	out	of	place.	He	was	blonde,	taller	than	average,	square across	the	shoulders,	good	looking,	energetic,	just	another	young	guy	come	to make	it	in	New	York.	He	could	disappear	here	forever,	but	it	felt	too	close,	like he’d	be	drawn	back	to	Maine.	Also,	he	wasn’t	crazy	about	living	in	such	a	big city.	Screw	it.	He	walked	to	Penn	Station	and	bought	a	ticket	to	Savannah	on	The Silver	Meteor,	leaving	at	6:30. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	ate	a	steak	sandwich,	drank	a	couple	of	beers,	and	boarded	as	soon	as	he could.	The	train	left	the	city	through	a	tunnel,	emerging	in	the	evening	light	to glide	slowly	by	refineries	and	warehouses.	Where	was	he	going’	Fear	and loneliness	began	to	take	over.	Instinctively,	he	forced	them	down	into	a	hard place	inside	him,	out	of	the	way.	If	he	gave	in	to	feeling	shitty	he	might	just	as well	turn	around	and	go	home.	Resisting	arrest,	a	big	buy—if	he	got	five	years, he’d	be	twenty-nine	when	he	got	out.	No	way.	The	hard	place	got	harder.	Like</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>uranium	compacted,	it	began	to	give	off	energy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	through	his	wallet,	removed	his	driver’s	license	and	a	credit	card,	and stashed	the	license	inside	a	sock	at	the	bottom	of	his	pack.	The	credit	card	was useless;	any	slip	he	signed	would	signal	where	he	was.	He	took	his	knife	and	cut the	card	into	six	pieces.	A	women’s	magazine	lay	on	the	seat	next	to	him.	He tore	out	a	page,	folded	the	plastic	pieces	into	it,	and	threw	it	away	in	the	lavatory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Probably	he	should	toss	the	license,	too.	But	he	might	need	photo	ID</p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhere.	He	could	get	rid	of	it	when	he	figured	out	how	to	get	some	other	ID. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	had	to	be	soon.	Charley	Walker	was	dead.	No,	not	dead.	Behind	him.	The hard	place	inside	him	said:	get	a	name.	He	thought	about	this	and	decided	that	he could	keep	Charley.	It	wasn’t	taking	much	of	a	chance;	there	were	a	lot	of Charleys.	Charley	Dunn.	The	name	came	to	him,	familiar	and	easy.	It	had	a rhythm	to	it.	Then	he	remembered	it	was	from	a	Jerry	Jeff	Walker	song	about	a guy	who	made	boots	in	Texas.	Charley	Dunn,	he	sang	to	himself.	The	sound	of the	wheels	sang	along.	Charley	Dunn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Charley	dozed,	waking	in	Philly	and	again	in	Washington,	D.C.	Strangers walked	by	his	window,	faces	pale	in	the	station	lights.	At	dawn,	the	train	was moving	through	low	country.	He	washed,	got	a	cup	of	coffee	from	the	club	car, and	watched	small	fields	and	trees	go	by,	patches	of	swamp,	dirt	roads,	a	few horses,	cows,	old	wooden	houses,	a	gas	station.	The	train	stopped	at	a	short platform.	An	older	woman	was	standing	silently	by	a	large	suitcase.	She boarded,	several	cars	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	got	off	in	Savannah,	feeling	numb	and	stiff.	He	hadn’t	slept	in	a	bed	for	three nights.	The	station	was	outside	the	city.	‘About	three	miles,’	a	cab	driver	told him.	‘But	you	don’t	want	to	walk	it.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No,	guess	I	don’t.’	Charley	put	his	pack	in	the	back	seat	and	got	in	front.	The driver	eased	from	the	station,	reaching	out	and	setting	the	meter	when	they turned	onto	an	access	road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Where	you	from?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Maine.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Maine’	Supposed	to	be	nice.	Cold.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>‘Not	too	bad,’	Charley	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Any	place	is	good,	you	got	money	in	your	pocket.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	know	a	place	I	could	stay,	not	too	expensive?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Oh,	Lord.	The	cheerleaders	are	in	town.	Filled	right	up.	State	cheerleader convention.’	He	rapped	out	a	rhythm	on	the	wheel	with	his	thumbs.	‘It’s	early, you	might	get	a	room	at	the	Howard	Johnson’s.	That	ain’t	too	bad.	Not	right	in the	middle	of	town,	but	not	too	far	neither.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Good	deal,’	Charley	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	drove	through	an	industrial	district	and	stopped	outside	a	HoJo’s	that	had seen	better	days.	He	gave	the	guy	a	ten. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	want	change?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Nope.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Thanks,	Brother.	This	is	going	to	be	a	good	day.’	He	had	a	hard	round	face	with eyes	that	seemed	to	close	when	he	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	hope	so,’	Charley	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	hang	on	in	case	you	need	to	go	somewheres	else.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	two	rooms	left.	Charley	waved	from	the	door,	and	the	driver	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	registered	as	Charley	Dunn,	1126	Needham	Street,	Boston,	MA,	an	invented address.	He	probably	shouldn’t	have	told	the	cab	driver	that	he	was	from	Maine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	he	had	to	be	from	somewhere.	He	collapsed	on	the	bed	and	slept	all afternoon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	got	up	at	dark,	took	a	shower,	and	ate	fried	shrimp	in	the	restaurant,	still	half asleep.	The	only	thing	between	him	and	jail	was	thirteen	thousand	dollars—well, twelve	something,	now.	Money,	work,	there	was	a	lot	to	figure	out.	He	went back	to	his	room	and	watched	a	Braves	game.	The	catcher	threw	out	a	runner stealing,	and	Charley	felt	a	flash	of	satisfaction.	How	it’s	done.	Charley	had	the best	arm	in	the	state.	Roland	was	solid	at	second.	Charley	saw	him	taking	a	hard</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>throw,	putting	on	the	tag,	getting	out	of	the	way.	He’d	look	up	at	Charley	with	a little	smile	and	whip	the	ball	around	the	infield. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	opened	his	eyes	in	the	morning,	he	didn’t	know	where	he	was.	A	semi went	by	outside,	and	he	remembered	the	road	outside	and	the	Howard	Johnson’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	took	a	long	shower	and	washed	his	dirty	underwear	and	socks,	leaving	them in	the	bathroom	to	dry.	He	counted	his	money,	putting	half	with	his	driver’s license	in	the	pack.	He	hung	the	pack	on	a	hook	in	the	closet	area.	If	he	got mugged,	he’d	have	something	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	walked	toward	the	center	of	the	city.	It	was	warmer	than	Maine—none	of	the fall	chill	that	sets	in	at	night.	There	were	oak	trees	with	gray-green	moss	hanging from	the	branches,	lots	of	little	parks	and	squares,	old	houses	with	wrought	iron railings.	He	had	breakfast	in	a	busy	place	called	Creary’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	want	grits	with	that	waffle?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Sure.	What	are	grits?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Corn.	Like	a	hot	cereal,	Honey.	Put	butter	on	‘em.	Some	folks	use	syrup.’	The waffle	was	fine.	It	took	a	couple	of	mouthfuls	to	get	used	to	the	grits—creamy and	gritty	at	the	same	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Anything	else	for	you,	Handsome?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No,	thanks.	Grits	are	good.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Where	you	from?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">He	paused.	‘Up	north.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No	kidding.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Near	Boston.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	only	been	far	as	New	York.’	She	took	his	plate.	‘Well,	y’all	come	back	and	see us.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Charley	walked	aimlessly	along	the	street.	Where	was	he	from’	He	was	going	to need	an	answer.	Maine	was	risky.	If	he	said,	New	Hampshire—say,	Portsmouth</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>or	Newburyport—somebody	might	know	more	about	the	place	than	he	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">North	of	Boston,	on	the	coast’	He	could	hear	the	next	question:	where	on	the coast’	He	didn’t	want	to	use	his	home	town.	Maybe	Portland’	He	knew	Portland pretty	well.	If	anyone	pressed	him	about	Portland,	he	could	say	he	went	to school	in	Orono,	hadn’t	lived	in	the	city	for	long.	He	actually	had	lived	in Portland	for	a	year.	He’d	visited	his	grandparents	there	often	when	he	was	little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Screw	it.	Charley	Dunn	from	Portland. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	crossed	an	avenue	and	descended	a	steep	alley	to	a	riverfront	walkway.	Ice cream	stores,	tourist	shops,	and	art	galleries	were	just	opening.	A	brother	with	a salt	and	pepper	beard	was	sitting	on	a	park	bench,	playing	a	sax.	There	was	a	red plastic	bucket	for	tips	by	his	feet,	but	he	seemed	to	be	playing	for	himself, repeating	lines,	listening	for	something.	Two	blondes	pushed	babies	in	strollers, side	by	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Charley	went	to	the	end	of	the	walk	and	turned	around.	He	was	edgy	about	the cash	in	his	pocket.	He	didn’t	look	like	someone	who	had	a	lot	of	money	on	him, but	he’d	feel	better	if	he	weren’t	carrying	so	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	climbed	up	from	the	river	walk	and	found	a	store	that	sold	travel	gear.	He bought	a	money	pouch	that	he	could	carry	inside	his	pants,	tied	around	his	waist or	hanging	from	a	belt	loop.	That	should	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	walked	through	a	park	and	stopped	to	look	at	an	elegant	black	cannon.	It	had a	cast	motto,	Ultima	Ratio	Regnum.	A	plaque	next	to	the	cannon	translated:	The Last	Reckoning	of	Kings.	Louis	XIV.	Force.	What	it	came	down	to.	Nothing wrong	with	smoking	a	joint	if	you	wanted.	It	was	saying	fuck	you	to	the	cops, that’s	what	they	couldn’t	handle.	Probably	why	he	did	it,	too.	It	was	fun—until you	got	caught.	Well,	he	wasn’t	caught	yet.	Harry	was,	but	that	was	his	problem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	family	would	probably	get	him	off,	somehow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Charley	got	back	to	the	hotel,	he	put	ten	thousand	in	the	travel	pouch, leaving	two	thousand	in	the	pack.	He	put	the	rest	of	the	money	in	his	wallet	and walked	back	and	forth	in	the	room,	getting	used	to	the	feel	of	the	pouch.	Better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	lay	down	and	let	out	a	deep	breath.	He	felt	a	pang	of	loneliness,	but	he pushed	it	into	the	hard	place.	There	were	things	to	figure	out.	Every	dollar	he spent	was	like	a	clock	ticking.	He	liked	Savannah.	Its	old	buildings	leaning toward	the	waterfront	reminded	him	of	Portland.	It	had	style.	But	he	wasn’t	sure</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>he	wanted	to	stay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wasn’t	tired	enough	to	sleep,	so	he	walked	back	into	town.	It	was	like summer.	Lots	of	people	on	the	streets,	all	going	places.	Students.	Shoppers.	Old people,	moving	slowly.	A	few	groups	of	laughing	girls,	cheerleaders	for	sure.	He wandered	into	a	bar	with	high	windows	facing	the	street.	A	friendly	crowd	was watching	a	football	game.	Georgia’Alabama.	It	was	Saturday,	he	realized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Georgia	had	a	hot	quarterback	throwing	flat	accurate	passes	all	over	the	field.	He was	getting	good	protection.	Nice	to	have	a	line,	Charley	thought.	Every	time Georgia	scored,	the	place	went	wild.	He	felt—not,	left	out,	just—not	quite	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alabama	didn’t	give	up.	They	kept	threatening	to	come	back,	but	it	wasn’t	their day.	Going	to	leave	tomorrow,	Charley	said	to	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	soon	as	he	heard	the	words	and	knew	his	mind,	the	bar	became	friendlier, more	important.	He	felt	sorry	for	the	bartender,	young,	stuck	in	a	dumb	job.	The guys	his	age	seemed	O.K.,	only	a	couple	of	assholes.	Older	guys,	some	weight on	them,	looked	happy,	a	little	dazed	at	tables	cluttered	with	bottles	and	glasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	took	a	ballpoint	from	his	pocket	and	made	a	few	lines	on	a	napkin,	framing the	room	before	he	filled	in	the	bar	and	tables,	heads	and	backs.	The	napkin started	to	tear.	He	folded	it,	put	it	in	his	shirt	pocket,	and	paid	his	check. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	walked	to	the	Howard	Johnson’s	which	was	full	but	felt	empty.	He	lay	down on	his	bed	for	a	moment,	then	got	up	and	crossed	the	street	to	a	convenience store	where	he	bought	a	sandwich,	a	diet	pepsi,	a	bottle	of	water,	and	a	Hershey bar.	He	went	back	to	the	room,	ate,	watched	the	last	three	quarters	of	High	Noon, and	tried	to	sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	mother’s	face	wouldn’t	go	away.	Thinking	back	was	going	to	screw	him	up; he	had	to	think	forward.	But	he	knew	she	was	worried.	She	was	in	good	shape, happy	with	Molly,	Ron,	and	Ron’s	kids,	but	she	would	have	heard.	He	couldn’t call	now	or	write.	Roses.	He	could	get	one	of	those	flower	stores	to	deliver	roses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	wasn’t	her	birthday	for	a	couple	of	months,	but	she	would	know	they	were from	him.	He	bought	her	a	dozen	roses	every	year.	He	could	pay	here,	and they’d	arrange	it.	Florists.	He	looked	in	the	yellow	pages	of	the	phone	book	and wrote	down	the	number	and	the	address	of	the	florist	with	the	largest advertisement.	He’d	tell	the	florist	it	was	a	surprise,	send	it	without	a	message. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	the	TV	on.	Turned	it	off	after	a	few	minutes.	Stared	at	the	ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>Where	should	he	go’	An	edge	of	panic	fluttered	like	a	sheet	covering	bad	stuff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	pushed	it	down.	What	he	needed	was	a	map.	He	went	down	to	the	lobby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	got	one	of	those	road	atlases,	all	the	states?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Sure	do.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">He	paid	and	went	back	to	his	room	holding	the	atlas	carefully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Georgia	was	a	big	state.	He	was	way	down	in	the	corner	of	it.	He	looked	at	the roads	crawling	over	the	map,	the	yellow	block	around	Atlanta,	the	lonely looking	places	in	the	opposite	corner,	up	by	Tennessee.	He	turned	the	page. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawaii.	Bunch	of	islands.	That	was	more	interesting.	He	looked	at	Florida,	at	the Keys	curving	out	into	the	ocean,	the	Atlantic	on	one	side,	the	Gulf	of	Mexico	on the	other.	The	ocean	seemed	good	to	him,	maybe	because	he	was	used	to	it.	He felt	that	he	could	be	more	anonymous	near	the	ocean.	In	Maine,	in	those	little towns	in	the	mountains,	everybody	knows	everything	about	everybody.	The woods	were	O.K.,	but	they	were	dark.	If	you	were	going	to	get	caught	or	die, you	wanted	your	last	look	to	go	up	into	the	sky,	not	get	caught	in	the	woods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	end,	Florida	didn’t	seem	far	enough	away.	He’d	never	been	to	the	west coast.	He	flew	to	San	Francisco. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a><b class="calibre3">4</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Charley’s	mom,	Charlotte,	and	her	husband,	Ron,	first	heard	the	news, they	talked	about	it	with	the	kids,	told	them	Charley	was	in	trouble,	that	he	was	a good	person	but	that	breaking	the	law	was	bad.	Eddie	asked,	‘What	happens	if they	catch	him?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘He’ll	spend	some	time	in	jail,’	Ron	said,	‘and	then	things	will	be	all	right.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	dubious	silence.	Eddie	got	his	stony	look.	Molly	brushed	away	a tear.	Heather	and	Megan	started	a	fight,	and	then	they	got	on	with	dinner.	They hadn’t	talked	about	it	since. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	night	in	bed,	she	said,	‘Charley’s	O.K.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	thought	you	were	feeling	better.	What	happened?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘He	sent	me	roses.	I	don’t	know	where	he	is.	No	message	or	anything.	I	put	them in	the	attic.	I	didn’t	want	you	to	worry,	didn’t	want	to	explain	them	to	the	kids.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	hope	he	turns	himself	in,’	Ron	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	don’t	believe	he	will.’	For	all	of	Charley’s	good	heart	and	sunny	disposition, he	had	a	private	stubborn	streak.	She	could	see	him	walking	next	to	his	father, Gordon,	half	as	tall,	but	with	the	same	walk,	the	two	of	them	leaving	on	a	fishing trip.	She	remembered	feeling	that	they	might	just	keep	going	and	never	come back.	Gordon	finally	did	just	that.	Just	as	well,	as	it	turned	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	lay	looking	upward.	Ron	cleared	his	throat,	twitched	a	little,	and	patted	her hand.	‘At	least	he’s	all	right,’	he	said.	‘You	need	a	hug?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘We	all	do,’	she	said	turning	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a><b class="calibre3">5</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Roland	Saucier	knocked	and	waited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Morning,	Ginny.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Hi,	Roland.	I	guess	you	have	to	ask	me	some	questions.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	guess,’	he	said.	‘I	don’t	like	this.	I	ain’t	seen	much	of	Charley	lately,	but,	you know	?’	He	was	apologetic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	want	a	cup	of	coffee’	Come	in.’	They	sat	in	the	kitchen.	‘How’s	Theresa?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	thought	of	Theresa	cheered	him	up.	‘Good.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You’ve	been	married,	what,	three,	four	years	now?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Going	on	six.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Jesus,’	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Roland	put	down	his	cup.	‘I	guess	you	haven’t	seen	him.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Guess	not,	Roland.’	He	didn’t	have	to	look	at	her	to	know	she	was	telling	the truth.	He’d	known	her	since	fourth	grade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Thing	is,	they’re	all	pumped	to	get	Charley.	Larsen	wants	the	publicity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Charley’d	get	off	easier	if	he’d	turn	himself	in—cut	a	deal,	like	Harry	George.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	don’t	know	what	Charley’ll	do.	I	mean’I	care—but	we	were	fixing	to	break	up anyway.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Roland	wasn’t	sure	what	to	say.	He	scratched	his	chin,	looked	around.	‘Yeah, well,	it	happens.	You	must	be	about	done	with	nursing	school.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘One	more	semester.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Ginny,	you	got	any	recent	pictures’	Charley’s	mother	didn’t	have	anything	but baby	pictures	and	school	pictures.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>Ginny	went	out	of	the	kitchen	and	returned	with	a	small	framed	black	and	white photograph.	She	looked	at	it	for	a	moment.	‘I’m	so	used	to	this.’	She	handed	it	to him.	‘Now	I’m	going	to	get	unused	to	it.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘We’ll	make	a	copy	and	get	it	back	to	you.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Take	your	time.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Roland	stood.	‘Guess	I’ll	be	getting	along.’	He	liked	Ginny.	She	had	a	hell	of	a body,	short	and	stacked.	Theresa	said	she	was	spoiled,	but	Ginny	couldn’t	help	it her	father	was	a	dentist,	gave	her	everything.	She	had	a	set	to	her	mouth	now; she	was	moving	on.	He	had	a	sudden	memory	of	her	in	the	stands,	of	a	runner stealing,	Charley	straightening	and	throwing,	low	and	left	of	the	bag,	Ginny cheering.	There	weren’t	many	who	could	make	that	throw	look	easy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shook	his	head.	‘Well,	you	gotta	do	what	you	gotta	do,	Ginny.	Too	bad, sometimes.	Let	me	know,	you	hear	from	Charley.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">That	brought	a	smile	and	a	touch	of	fire.	‘Right,	Roland.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">He	zipped	his	leather	jacket	halfway	and	walked	back	to	the	patrol	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a><b class="calibre3">6</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">This	is	more	like	it,	Charley	said	to	himself.	San	Francisco	is	different	from	the east—newer,	looser.	More	Asians.	It	was	cheerful.	Half	the	people	on	Market Street	looked	like	they	were	on	the	run.	There	was	a	big	park	in	the	center	of	the city,	extending	almost	to	the	ocean.	All	kinds	of	action	in	the	park.	A	zoo.	Lions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Across	a	boulevard,	a	long	beach.	The	Pacific	was	vast	and	gray,	impersonal, bigger	than	the	Atlantic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Charley	was	glad	to	make	friends.	But	the	first	four	guys	who	started conversations	turned	out	to	be	gay.	They	were	quick	to	invite	him	to	special places.	They	wanted	to	keep	their	hands	on	him.	It	was	weird.	He	was	used	to being	turned	down	by	chicks;	now	he	was	the	one	doing	the	rejecting.	He	didn’t want	to	hurt	anybody’s	feelings;	he	just	wasn’t	wired	that	way.	They	got	huffy	or sullen.	The	air	was	filled	with	sexual	vibrations;	the	ordinary	sidewalk	was really	a	sexual	swamp.	The	women	were	gorgeous,	well	dressed,	and	in	a	hurry; they	didn’t	seem	to	see	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	ate	dinners	in	the	Tip	Top	Chop	Suey	Cafe	where	the	entertainment	consisted of	an	old	waiter	filling	dessert	dishes,	sliding	each	with	a	flick	of	his	wrist	along a	narrow	stainless	ledge.	There	was	nothing	to	keep	the	dishes	from	spinning	off and	crashing	to	the	floor.	All	heads	at	the	counter	followed	each	dish	as	it	slid slowly	along	and	bumped	to	rest	against	the	previous	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	month	later,	Charley	decided	to	try	Hawaii	for	a	week.	It	was	a	five	hour	flight to	Honolulu.	When	he	stepped	off	the	plane,	warm	perfumed	air	welcomed	him like	a	friend.	White	clouds	billowed	over	jagged	green	mountains.	A	few passengers	lowered	their	heads	to	receive	leis.	Others	walked	quickly	through the	terminal,	heading	home.	He	felt	unexpectedly	happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Going	to	the	Hale	Aloha,’	he	said	to	a	cab	driver. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Ha-Lay	Aloha?’	the	driver	said.	‘Waikiki?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yeah,	right.	I	just	got	here.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	gonna	like	it.’	The	driver’s	voice	was	easy,	but	it	had	an	undertone	of	don’t mess	with	me.	‘Where	you	from?’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>‘Back	east,	where	it	snows.’	He’d	found	that	out	in	San	Francisco—that	he	came from	back	east.	You	had	to	go	out	west	to	learn	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘We	got	snow	on	the	Big	Island.	Thirteen	thousand	feet.	Crazy	buggahs	go	ski up	there.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ve	shoveled	enough	to	last	me	awhile.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	saw	all	I	wanted	in	Germany,’	the	driver	said.	‘Free	tour	in	the	army.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Never	been	to	Germany.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Foxy	ladies.	They	like	us	island	boys—we	got	any	money.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">They	passed	a	Del	Monte	cannery	and	streets	lined	with	industrial	buildings.	A small	Chinatown.	Several	blocks	of	office	buildings	and	banks.	A	large	double-decked	shopping	center	across	from	a	park	bordered	by	palms.	A	glimpse	of	the horizon,	edge	of	light	blue	and	darker	blue.	They	drove	into	a	district	crowded with	hotels,	and	the	driver	stopped	in	front	of	a	mid-sized	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Here	you	go,	Brah.	Hale	Aloha.	Waikiki.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a><b class="calibre3">7</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Jag	was	parked	by	the	front	walk,	British	racing	green	dusty	from	the	long drive.	EN	GARDE,	the	name	of	his	father’s	boat	and	one	of	his	investment funds,	was	barely	readable	on	the	license	plate.	Harry	felt	a	familiar	prick	of irritation	mixed	with	affection.	As	he	approached	the	house,	he	saw	his	father through	the	bay	window,	a	glass	in	his	hand,	holding	forth.	Harry	made	a	face and	entered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Ah,	my	son	the	smuggler,’	his	father	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘How	did	it	go,	Dear?’	His	mother	was	dressed	for	dinner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No	problem.	Eagleton	did	his	thing.	Ten	thousand	bucks.	Community	service, 200	hours!	I	guess	The	George	Foundation	will	be	hearing	about	Chief	Larsen’s youth	center	project	after	a	decent	interval.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Thank	goodness!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">His	father	extended	a	hard	hand.	Harry	shook	hands	but	didn’t	play	the	grip game.	His	father	was	bigger	than	he	was.	He	had	a	high	bony	forehead,	curly chestnut	hair,	a	way	of	looming	over	you,	Ben	George	here.	Harry	had	his mother’s	fine	bones,	dark	hair,	and	chiseled	features.	His	mouth	was	like	his father’s,	wide.	There	was	a	similar	set	to	their	shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Help	yourself.’	His	father	pointed	to	the	sideboard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	lifted	a	decanter	of	sherry.	‘Mother?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	fine	for	the	moment,	thank	you,	Dear.	I	am	so	relieved.’	Harry	put	the decanter	down	and	poured	himself	whisky,	adding	a	little	water,	feeling	his father’s	eyes	on	him.	In	a	moment	his	father	would	say,	That’s	the	way	it’s	taken in	Scotland. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘That’s	the	way	it’s	taken	in	Scotland.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘And	Cumberland,’	Harry	interrupted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘By	Georges,’	his	father	said.	Maybe	this	was	going	to	work	out,	Harry	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>‘Rum	runners.’	Uh,	oh.	‘Supernumaries	of	the	underworld.’	Nope.	‘I’m	not against	making	a	buck,	mind	you.’	His	father	gathered	steam.	‘But	I’m	not	wild about	wasting	it.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘It	was	a	mistake,	Ben,’	his	mother	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yes,’	his	father	said.	He	frowned.	‘Your	mother	and	I	will	split	the	amount.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	pay	you	back.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘How	are	you	going	to	do	that’	Borrow	it	from	your	mother?’	A	small	flash passed	behind	Harry’s	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Well,	well,’	his	father	said.	‘I	think	you’re	annoyed.	Maybe	you’re	a	George after	all.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	think	you’re	so	tough.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Well,	like	Muhammed	Ali	said,	the	ones	is	strong	enough,	ain’t	fast	enough;	the ones	is	fast	enough	ain’t	strong	enough.’	His	father’s	mouth	twisted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Ben.	Harry!	Stop	this.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘It’s	all	right,’	Ben	said.	He	stretched	one	arm	out,	loosening	a	large	shoulder.	He kept	in	shape,	Harry	had	to	admit.	He	liked	looking	good	on	his	boat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You’ll	get	it	back	with	interest,’	he	said	flatly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	father	shrugged.	‘You’re	my	son,	not	an	investment.	Don’t	worry	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	just—it’s	tough	out	there.	There’s	always	somebody	trying	to	screw	you.	You have	to	get	them	before	they	get	you;	it	usually	takes	money.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No	one	has	gotten	you	yet.’	His	mother	switched	to	approval. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Not	recently,’	his	father	said.	Ethel	appeared	in	the	doorway	and	asked	if	she should	put	the	crab	cakes	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘That	would	be	marvelous,’	his	mother	said.	‘Harry,	I	will	have	a	taste	more.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dinner	was	less	contentious.	Half	way	through,	his	father	came	back	to	money again.	‘So,	what	next,	Harry’	Was	all	that	Bowdoin	tuition	for	naught?’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>‘No	way.	I	got	a	tooth	knocked	out,	and	we	destroyed	Hamilton	in	the	finals.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Well	done.’	His	father	had	played	football	at	Hamilton	but	not	hockey.	Harry was	too	small	for	football,	but	he	had	been	skating	since	he	was	two,	all	through prep	school	and	Bowdoin.	He	took	a	pounding	in	the	corners,	but	he	kept	after	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	skating	saved	him;	he	was	a	split	second	faster	than	most	and	had	perfect balance.	They	called	him	a	natural	skater.	Mostly	it	was	that	he	had	started	so early. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	working	on	some	deals.	Legal,	you’ll	be	glad	to	hear.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Good,	good.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	deals	might	be	legal,	but	the	front	money	wasn’t.	Harry	had	a	laundry problem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	excused	himself,	went	upstairs,	and	lay	on	his	bed.	It	hadn’t	been	a	bad	day, really.	The	court	hassle	was	over	with.	He’d	have	paid	off	his	father	on	the	spot, but	then	he	would	have	had	to	explain	where	the	money	came	from.	He’d	put that	money	to	work,	pay	him	later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	fell	asleep	and	dreamed	that	an	old	man,	the	father	of	a	friend,	was	stumbling across	a	field	to	meet	him.	The	man	crossed	under	a	fence	and	became	a	pigeon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dark	blood	flooded	through	his	breast	feathers.	Harry	held	the	pigeon	in	his hand,	heart	pumping,	old	eyes	open,	sad	and	needy.	The	blood	turned	to	a	clear fluid,	like	tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a><b class="calibre3">8</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Waikiki	beach	at	sunset:	gold	to	pink,	then	crimson	and	dark,	stars	over	the Pacific,	no	one	to	share. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Diamond	Head.	Kapiolani	Park,	the	smell	of	teriyaki,	the	sound	of	doves, congas,	slack	key	guitar.	The	zoo,	tigers	pacing,	elephants	listening.	Gorgeous women. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	fifth	day,	he	called	the	Nuuanu	YMCA.	They	had	rooms	by	the	day, week,	or	month.	He	rode	TheBus	downtown	and	paid	for	a	week.	He	carried	his pack	up	a	flight	of	stairs,	walked	down	a	hall,	and	opened	the	door	to	a	narrow cubicle.	There	was	a	window	at	the	end,	a	chair,	a	small	bureau.	He	put	his	pack on	the	chair	and	lay	on	the	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	passed	his	door	heading	for	the	bathroom,	flip	flops	slapping.	He	heard the	shower	running	and	snatches	of	song	in	a	high	pure	voice.	It	was	good	to	be out	of	Waikiki.	He	relaxed	for	a	few	minutes	and	jumped	up.	Time	to	take	a walk,	eat	something,	and	come	back.	It	felt	important	to	leave	and	to	come	back, to	begin	to	establish	his	new	home.	On	his	way	out,	the	singer	passed	him,	a brown	man	with	massive	shoulders	and	a	towel	around	his	waist.	Three	hundred pounds,	easy.	Slap,	slap,	slap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	night	at	his	favorite	bar,	beneath	a	banyan	tree	in	the	courtyard	behind	the Moana	Hotel,	the	same	bar	where	he	first	had	the	idea	of	using	someone	else’s identity	to	get	a	replacement	birth	certificate,	Charley	got	into	a	conversation with	a	guy	named	Ray	who	was	complaining	about	his	brother.	‘William	Junior,’</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	guy	said,	‘doesn’t	have	to	do	shit.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘That	your	father’s	name,	William?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘William	Jackson.	William	Jackson	Jr.‘Mr.	Perfect.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘He	older	than	you?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Three	years.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What	are	you,	twenty-two?’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>‘Twenty-six.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Bullshit.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Twenty-six,	man.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Bullshit.	You	ain’t	no	twenty-six.	I	got	twenty	bucks	says	so.’	Charley	laid	a twenty	on	the	bar.	Ray	pulled	out	his	wallet	and	showed	Charley	his	driver’s license’Raymond	Jackson,	Birthdate:	April	9,	1952.	It	was	a	New	York	license. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Charley	felt	a	buzz	in	his	ears.	‘Son	of	a	bitch,’	he	said	and	slid	the	bill	to	Ray. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ray	put	his	wallet	away,	moved	the	bill	toward	the	bartender,	and	signalled	for two	more	beers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘So,	New	York,	huh.	Fucking	Yankees.’	Charley	bitched	about	the	Red	Sox	and steered	back	to	growing	up.	Food.	Mothers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Lasagne,	scallopine,’	Ray	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What,	your	mom’s	Italian’	You	got	all	the	breaks.	What	was	her	name’	I	mean her	family,	before	she	married	your	Dad.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Gianelli.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Gianelli.	My	mom	was	a	pretty	good	cook,	you	know,	an	all	around	cook.	We didn’t	get	scallopine,	though.	What	did	they	call	her,	Gina,	Gina	Gianelli?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Maria.	Like	in	West	Side	Story.	Maria	‘Ray	sang. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘All	right!’	Charley	said.	His	ears	were	really	buzzing	now.	One	piece	of	the puzzle	left,	but	he	didn’t	see	how	to	get	it.	Where	was	he	born’</p>
<p class="calibre1">A	tall	slim	sister	walked	by,	giving	them	a	good	look.	‘Not	bad,’	Ray	said.	She came	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Now	that’s	a	shame,’	she	said.	‘Cute	guys	like	you—where	your	dates?’	She tilted	her	head	for	an	answer,	cocked	her	hips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Charley	shrugged	and	smiled.	‘What’s	your	name?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Shana.’	She	answered	Charley	but	she	had	her	eyes	on	Ray	who	was	looking</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>dazzled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Shana,	I’m	Charley.	This	is	Ray.	So,	you	want	a	drink?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	could	handle	that.’	Charley	moved	down	one	stool.	She	put	a	small	black purse	on	the	bar	between	them	and	slid	slowly	onto	the	stool,	her	short	skirt riding	farther	up	long	smooth	legs.	Ray	began	to	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bartender	came	over.	‘What	may	I	get	you	this	evening?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">She	considered.	‘It’s	early.	Pina	Colada	sounds	good.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘My	round,’	Charley	said	putting	another	twenty	on	the	bar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shana	looked	first	at	Ray	and	then	at	Charley.	‘Where	you	from?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Boston,’	Charley	said.	‘Took	my	first	breath	at	Mass	General.	How	about	you?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Seattle.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Seattle—which	hospital?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Providence.	My	mama	told	me	I	was	about	to	be	born	in	the	front	seat	of	an Oldsmobile,	but	we	made	it,	ten	minutes	to	spare.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Ray’s	a	New	Yorker.	Goddamn	Yankee	fan.	Probably	born	in	the	upper	deck, centerfield.	Born	in	the	Bronx,	right?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No	way.	Downtown,	man.	St.	Vincents.’	Bingo!	Shana	zeroed	in	on	Ray. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What	you	doing	in	the	islands,	Handsome?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Hanging	out,’	Ray	said.	‘On	my	way	through	from	Okinawa.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Hey	listen,’	Charley	said,	‘I	gotta	split.	I	just	remembered	I’m	supposed	to	meet someone.’	He	drained	his	beer.	‘Adios—nice	talking	with	you.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘All	right,	man.	See	you	around.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Hasta	la	vista,’	Shana	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>As	soon	as	he	was	out	of	sight,	Charley	stopped	and	scribbled	down	the information.	Was	it	Ginelli	or	Gianelli’	When	he	said	Gina	Gianelli,	Ray	hadn’t corrected	him.	He	was	going	to	have	to	go	with	Gianelli,	take	a	chance.	Maria Gianelli.	He	could	see	the	license	in	front	of	him’April	9,	1952.	A	year	older,	big deal.	St.	Vincents.	This	was	the	luckiest	thing	that	had	happened	since	he	shoved Harry’s	money	in	his	pocket	and	Darlene	picked	him	up.	He	could	feel	the	future opening.	Ray	wasn’t	going	to	remember	much,	by	the	look	of	him	leaning toward	Shana.	He	wouldn’t	have	minded	leaning	toward	her	himself,	but	he	had to	keep	his	eye	on	the	prize.	Stay	away	from	the	Moana	for	a	couple	of	weeks, he	told	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	morning,	Charley	took	TheBus	to	the	airport.	He	liked	the	terminal;	he	felt anonymous,	unnoticed.	Also,	it	reminded	him	of	when	he	arrived	and	of	how much	he’d	learned	about	the	island.	He	walked	past	a	florist	and	remembered that	his	mother’s	birthday	was	in	a	few	weeks.	He	called	New	York	information from	a	pay	phone.	A	lady	at	St	Vincents	Hospital	told	him	that	they	didn’t	keep birth	certificates,	that	he	had	to	call	the	Bureau	of	Vital	Records,	Department	of Health,	City	of	New	York. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	apartment	was	in	Palolo	on	a	narrow	road	three	blocks	up	the	side	of	the ridge.	It	was	new,	built	into	the	lower	story	of	a	house.	The	owner	was	finishing a	small	deck	when	Charley	got	there.	Charley	introduced	himself:	‘Ray Jackson.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guy	looked	him	over,	and	Charley	knew	it	was	no	deal.	The	ridge	on	the other	side	of	the	valley	was	dark	green.	Far	down	the	valley,	a	scrap	of	blue ocean	winked	in	the	sun.	‘Ocean	view,’	Charley	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	owner	was	careful.	He	didn’t	say	he	wasn’t	going	to	rent	to	a	young	haole who	had	just	showed	up	on	the	island;	he	just	shoved	the	piece	of	paper	Charley gave	him	into	one	pocket.	‘Lot	of	people	looking,’	he	said	and	continued working. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Charley	walked	down	the	hill.	It	was	all	right.	The	place	was	a	little	too	far away,	and	he	didn’t	want	to	live	downstairs	from	that	guy.	It	was	the	first	time he’d	used	the	name,	Ray	Jackson.	Saying	it	was	awkward.	A	wave	of	rejection swept	through	him.	I	don’t	want	to	be	Ray.	I’m	Charley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	thought	about	riding	TheBus	to	the	airport,	buying	a	ticket	for	Portland,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>turning	himself	in.	‘Hey,	Charley,’	people	would	say.	He	smiled,	nodding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Charley.	Then	he	imagined	some	asshole	sentencing	him	to	five	years	in Thomaston.	‘Ray,’	he	said.	‘I’m	Ray	Jackson.	I’m	Ray	Jackson.’	He	said	it	over and	over	until	the	muscles	in	his	jaw	and	throat	relaxed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	got	back	to	Ala	Moana,	he	threw	his	bus	pass	away,	a	day	early,	and bought	another.	Ray	Jackson,	he	signed	it.	He	sat	in	Dunkin	Donuts	and	signed his	new	name	in	a	small	notebook	until	he	was	comfortable	with	that,	too.	He tore	the	pages	out	and	dropped	them	in	the	trash	with	his	cup.	He	would	cut	up his	driver’s	license	when	he	got	back,	he	promised	himself.	But,	when	he	was	in his	room	again,	he	didn’t	reach	for	the	sock	at	the	bottom	of	his	pack.	He	needed the	license	as	a	kind	of	anchor,	proof	that	he	was	Charley	Walker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	followed	Keaumoku	Street	across	a	flat	business	district,	under	the	freeway, and	up	into	Makiki,	a	neighborhood	of	small	condominium	buildings	and	a	few older	houses	built	one	above	the	other	on	lush	green	hillsides.	He	turned	into	the driveway	of	a	large	house	and	rang	the	bell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	looking	for	the	studio	apartment,’	he	said	to	a	Chinese	man	who	opened	the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Just	going	to	work,’	the	man	said,	closing	the	door	behind	him	and	putting	out his	hand.	‘I’m	Bob	Wu.’	His	gold	rimmed	glasses	shone	in	the	sun.	He	was medium	sized,	trim,	and	balding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Ray	Jackson.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Ray,	huh?’	Bob	said.	‘I	ever	see	you	in	Vegas?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	don’t	think	so.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	lucky,	Ray.	I	see	it.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	be	lucky,	you	got	a	place	for	me	to	rent.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bob	looked	him	over	again.	‘Maybe	I	got	just	the	place.	Come	see.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	room	was	tiny,	one	of	four,	side	by	side	above	a	long	garage.	At	one	end	of the	garage,	wooden	stairs	led	to	an	external	walkway,	shaded	by	a	partially	built roof.	‘We	just	finishing.	You	work’	Maybe	you	help.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>‘I	work.	But	I	don’t	have	tools	with	me.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Good,	good.’	Bob	opened	the	first	door	and	pointed	to	a	hot	plate	and	a	midget refrigerator.	‘You	get	your	own	dishes.	$55	a	week,	electric	included.	You	pay now,	one	week.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Well,	O.K.	Good	deal!	I	like	it.’	He	handed	Bob	three	twenties	and	received	a five,	back.	‘You	want	a	security	deposit?’	Bob	looked	at	him	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No	need.	You	pay	Friday.	Maybe	you	help,	Saturday.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘O.K.’	Bob	slid	the	door	key	from	his	key	ring	and	handed	it	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘This	556,	A1.	A1,	huh?’	Bob	laughed.	‘You	like	it	here.	Lucky	Ray.	Gotta	go.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">He	walked	away	with	quick	steps	and	drove	down	the	hill	in	a	gray	Chevy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ray.	It	had	come	out	easier	than	he	thought	it	would;	practicing	had	helped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Charley	echoed	in	his	mind.	He	put	it	away	in	the	hard	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bed	nearly	filled	the	room.	He	sat	on	it	and	then	lay	back	on	the	mattress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	needed	a	pillow	and	sheets,	a	light	comforter	or	something.	He	sprang	up	and left,	locking	the	door.	556	Keaumoku,	A1.	He	was	lucky.	He	began	to	whistle,	to walk	more	cheerfully.	It	was	as	though	Ray	had	just	been	born.	Bob	Wu	had appeared	to	help	with	the	delivery. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a><b class="calibre3">9</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">‘My	father’s	kind	of	an	asshole,’	Harry	said.	He	and	Lynn	were	sitting	in	his	car on	the	Eastern	Prom,	looking	over	the	bay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	want	to	meet	him.	Does	he	look	like	you?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Good	muffin,’	he	said.	‘Beautiful	today.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Well?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘He’s	bigger	than	I	am,	blonde,	has	a	square	face.	I	look	more	like	my	mother.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	like	the	way	you	look.	I	want	to	meet	her	too.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘This	weekend	wouldn’t	be	good.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Soon,’	Lynn	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Soon.	Maybe	we	can	see	my	father	in	New	York;	he’s	easier	to	take	in	the	city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	home—he	and	mother—they’re	O.K.	with	each	other,	but	they’re	like	fighters in	separate	corners.	You	keep	listening	for	the	bell.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘At	least	they	fight.	My	folks	never	raised	their	voices.	My	mom	went	on	a	trip to	Florida	with	her	girlfriend,	came	back	two	weeks	later	with	a	tan,	and	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	can	all	take	care	of	yourselves,	now.	It’s	time	for	me	to	move	on.?’	Lynn’s voice	dropped.	?‘I	love	you,’	she	told	us.	‘I’ll	miss	you	a	bunch,	but	it’s	time	to go.’	Dad	helped	her	pack,	and	that	was	that.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Damn,’	Harry	said,	‘what	did	you	do?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Went	to	college.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘She’s	in	Florida,	right’.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘New	Smyrna	Beach,	near	Daytona,	working	in	a	health	food	store.	She	sends me	little	bottles	of	enzymes	and	things.	Vitamin	C.’	She	shook	her	head.	‘I couldn’t	believe	it	when	she	left,	but	she’s	definitely	happier.	She’s	got	a	guy.	I met	him	last	Christmas.	He	makes	ceramics,	dishes	and	things.	He’s	all	right,	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>little	New	Age.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Maybe	we	could	swing	down	there	this	winter,	visit.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lynn	looked	pleased.	She	put	her	hand	on	his	leg	and	wiggled	her	shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Couldn’t	we	go	somewhere?’	Harry’s	eyes	moved	down	over	her	breasts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	mean	like	a	motel’	Too	early.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No,	I	don’t	want	to	be	cooped	up	in	a	motel	room.	Outside!	It’s	a	great	day.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘How	about	Bradbury	Mountain?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">They	drove	to	Pownal	and	climbed	through	the	trees.	‘Hard	to	call	this	a mountain,’	Harry	said	as	they	sat	on	a	ledge	at	the	top.	‘Mini-mountain,	maybe.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	of	the	leaves	were	down.	Small	hills,	woods,	and	fields	merged	into	each other,	flattening	toward	the	coast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Look!’	Lynn	pointed	to	a	high	line	of	dots,	coming	closer.	The	geese	turned toward	them.	Harry	could	see	the	V	and	hear	the	distant	continuous	honking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘God,	they’re	beautiful.	That	sound,	it	breaks	my	heart.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	geese	flew	by,	exchanging	positions,	heads	extended	forward,	wings	beating steadily,	moving	fast.	When	they	began	to	pass	from	sight,	Lynn	put	her	arms around	him.	He	held	her	and	put	his	face	against	her	neck	and	shoulder.	She twisted	for	a	last	look	at	the	geese. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Tempus	fugit,’	he	said,	but	the	joke,	if	that’s	what	it	was,	fell	flat	in	the	brisk	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lynn	turned	to	him,	and	he	felt	her	grief	and	acceptance.	Time	does	fly,	and	we can	live,	get	on	with	it,	or	be	left	behind,	her	body	was	saying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	stumbled	away	from	the	ledge	and	went	to	their	knees	on	a	bed	of	pine needles	and	fallen	leaves	behind	a	patch	of	juniper.	Lynn	tugged	at	his	belt buckle,	felt	for	the	ground	with	her	hips,	and	drew	him	with	her	as	she	rolled onto	her	back.	He	opened	her	jeans	and	dragged	them	down	past	her	hips.	She pushed	down	her	panties	and	made	a	happy	incoherent	sound	as	he	entered	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ground	was	mute	and	cool;	they	had	so	little	time;	it	was	frightening	and lucky	to	be	alive	at	all.	She	held	him	tighter	and	tighter	until	he	came	and collapsed.	She	rocked	him	back	and	forth.	‘There,’	she	said.	‘There.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>Harry	blinked	and	thought	about	rolling	off	her.	‘I	can’t	move.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Don’t.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">They	heard	voices,	then	a	crashing	through	the	underbrush.	A	black	and	white dog	was	sniffing	at	them,	wagging	its	tail.	‘Jesus,’	Harry	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Lulu!’	The	dog’s	owner	was	close. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lynn	called	out,	‘Just	a	minute	here,	while	I	get	dressed.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	pulled	his	pants	up	and	brushed	needles	and	bits	of	twigs	from	his	hands and	knees.	‘Good	dog,’	he	said.	Lynn	stood	slowly	and	took	a	deep	breath, running	fingers	through	her	hair.	Her	face	was	wider,	slowed,	happier,	as	though she	had	incorporated	the	two	of	them	with	the	geese	and	the	smell	of	earth	and leaves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lulu	raced	back	to	her	owner.	Lynn	and	Harry	went	the	other	way,	following	a trail	along	a	stone	wall	around	the	back	side	of	the	park.	Half	an	hour	later	they emerged	at	the	far	end	of	the	parking	lot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘It’s	so	quiet,’	Lynn	said.	‘It	smells	so	good.	I	hate	to	leave.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yeah.	You	hungry?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Getting	there.	Didn’t	you	say	that	your	father’s	boat	was	coming	out	today?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yep.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Why	don’t	we	eat	at	the	marina,	say	hello,	maybe?’	He	started	to	object	but	he didn’t	want	to	disturb	the	blanket	of	contentment	that	had	settled	over	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You’ll	be	sorry.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Oh,	Harry.	I’ll	bet	I	like	him.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">He’ll	like	you,	Harry	thought.	‘Turkey	club,’	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Caesar	salad,’	Lynn	said.	‘I	love	you.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Well,	I	love	you,	too.’	It	was	true	as	he	said	it,	and	not	true.	Not	true	because	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>part	of	him	wasn’t	there,	wasn’t	behind	the	words.	He	had	things	to	do	that didn’t	involve	her	or	love	either.	She	stroked	his	leg.	One	of	the	best	things	about Lynn	was	that	she	pretty	much	accepted	him	the	way	he	was.	It	was	a	relief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Also,	she	was	a	great	fuck.	He	turned	down	the	steep	hill	to	the	marina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">En	Garde	was	already	up	on	stands,	her	hull	still	glistening,	when	Harry	and Lynn	approached	his	father.	‘Well,	here’s	a	surprise,’	his	father	said,	looking	at Lynn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Dad,	this	is	Lynn.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">She	held	out	her	hand	and	said,	‘Very	nice	to	meet	you.’	He	adjusted	himself	to her	height	and	regarded	her	for	an	extra	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Ben,’	he	said,	shaking	her	hand.	‘Where	did	you	get	those	eyes’	Are	you	Scots?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Norwegian,	on	my	father’s	side.	English,	a	bit	of	French.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Marvelous,’	he	said.	He	looked	up	at	En	Garde.	‘I	always	hate	to	see	the	old	girl stuck	on	land;	she	was	meant	to	be	in	the	water.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Like	most	boats,’	Harry	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	father	ignored	him.	‘They	don’t	make	‘em	like	that	any	more,’	he	said, managing	somehow	to	include	Lynn	in	the	category.	He	checked	his	watch.	‘Will you	have	lunch	with	me’	The	Galley	has	decent	food.’	Harry’s	eyes	stayed	on	his father’s	Mickey	Mouse	watch.	Mickey	had	pointed	to	the	time	on	his	father’s wrist	for	as	long	as	Harry	could	remember. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	father	had	bought	fifty	of	them	at	a	liquidation	sale;	he	wore	them	out	one	by one.	If	he	was	asked,	he	would	talk	about	Americana,	collector’s	item,	value	as opposed	to	price,	and	so	on.	He	had	half	a	dozen	riffs,	usually	ending,	And besides’I	like	Mickey,	or	we’re	buddies,	or	we	talk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	asked	him	once	why	he	didn’t	wear	a	Rolex	or	a	Piaget.	‘The	human touch,’	his	father	said	and	went	on	seriously.	‘It	helps	to	keep	people	off	balance, gives	you	a	tighter	turning	radius.	Besides’I	like	Mickey.’	He’d	given	one	to Harry	for	graduation	from	prep	school,	along	with	the	keys	to	a	two	year	old Cutlass.	Harry	lost	the	watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>‘Do	they	have	Caesar	salad?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Finest	kind.’	His	father	led	them	inside	and	asked	for	a	window	table.	They went	through	a	couple	of	bottles	of	Chardonnay	and	a	round	of	Irish	coffee.	Ben told	sailing	stories—storms,	ports	in	the	Caribbean,	feats	of	navigation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘And	then	there	was	the	time	you	rammed	the	Poughkeepsie	bridge,’	Harry	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘A	dark	night,’	his	father	said.	‘Of	the	soul.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ve	had	a	few	of	those,’	Lynn	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yes,’	Ben	said.	‘I	was	working	in	Kingston	at	a	job	I	disliked.	I	realized,	well into	the	evening,	that	the	only	sensible	course	was	down	river—just	get	the	hell out.	I	had	a	little	Stone	Horse	sloop,	Gypsy,	cutter	rigged.	I	took	her	out	of Esopus	Creek	and	turned	right.	Beautiful	night.	Soft.	Overcast.	A	bit	later	I	was below,	opening	a	bottle	of	Laphroaig	I’d	saved	for	a	special	occasion,	when we’Gypsy	and	I’discovered	the	bridge.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What	happened?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Some	damage	to	the	bow.	We	got	hung	up	but	didn’t	sink.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘The	State	Police	came	to	his	rescue,’	Harry	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Flashing	lights,’	his	father	said.	‘Sometimes	you	get	the	bear;	sometimes	the bear	gets	you.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Arrested	you	for	what?’	Harry	persisted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Drunken	boating.	I	have	a	record	in	New	York.’	He	gave	Lynn	the	Ben	George smile.	If	he	were	winning,	the	smile	was	sympathetic;	if	he	were	losing,	it	was gracious,	rueful,	the	little	boy	who	couldn’t.	Untouchable.	He	controlled	the situation	either	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	couldn’t	take	any	more.	‘Thanks	for	lunch.	We’ve	got	to	be	going.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Thank	you	for	the	company.	A	day	late	for	a	sail,	but	perhaps	we’ll	get	another chance,’	he	said	to	Lynn. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>‘Oh,	I	hope	so,’	Lynn	said.	‘I’m	so	glad	to	have	met	you.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Likewise.’	Ben	paid	the	check	and	walked	back	to	his	boat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	and	Lynn	drove	up	the	hill,	each	waiting	for	the	other	to	speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘He’s	not	what	I	expected	at	all.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Oh’	Bigger?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yes,	but	that’s	not	it.	He’s	kind	of	sweet,	really.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Just	one	big	lump	of	sugar.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Well,	I	can	see	that	he’s	used	to	getting	his	way,	but	there’s	another	side	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	I’m	dying	to	meet	your	mom.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Give	this	to	Peter	and	bring	back	the	form	when	you’re	done.	Signed.	Stay	out of	trouble.	You	can’t	leave	the	country.	If	you’re	going	out	of	state	for	more	than a	week,	give	me	a	call.	Any	questions,	call	me.	We’ll	talk	when	you’re	done	with community	service.’	He	looked	down	at	Harry’s	file	and	shook	his	head.	‘You got	off	pretty	easy,’	he	said.	‘Don’t	screw	up.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Don’t	worry.’	They	shook	hands.	‘Thank	you,’	Harry	said	and	walked	outdoors, ripping	off	his	tie.	Poor	sap,	stuck	in	that	office,	probably	up	to	his	ass	in	debt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	drove	to	the	soup	kitchen	and	was	given	a	choice	of	shifts	by	Pete,	a	short bald	guy	with	wide	shoulders	and	big	hands.	‘Mornings,	afternoons,	or	nights—</p>
<p class="calibre1">ten	to	two;	two	to	six;	six	to	ten.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Nights.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pete	ran	his	thumb	over	a	schedule.	‘Next	week,	Monday	through	Saturday?’	It wasn’t	really	a	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Fine.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	tell	Dale.	He’ll	be	your	supervisor,	show	you	what	to	do.’	He	made	an	entry on	the	schedule.	‘Should	work	out	good.	I’ll	be	gone	at	five;	just	check	in	with Dale.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>‘Will	do.’	Harry	went	outside	and	breathed	deeply,	letting	the	air	wash	away	the smell	of	fat,	detergent,	and	floor	mops. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Hey,	Buddy—help	a	guy	out?’	A	man	lurched	toward	him,	scarred	leather	jacket hanging	open	over	a	red	hooded	sweatshirt.	Several	others	watched,	leaning against	the	building,	smoking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Sorry,’	Harry	said,	starting	to	move	toward	his	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘All	right.	God	bless.’	He	didn’t	have	the	spaced	out,	twitchy,	drug	look.	Hooked on	something’booze,	probably.	Despair.	‘Milky	Way,	Man!’	He	raised	one	arm over	his	head	and	pointed.	‘The	galaxy!	A	hundred	million	stars.’	Harry	stopped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guy	made	a	circle	with	his	thumb	and	finger.	He	sighted	through	the	circle and	moved	his	arm	six	inches.	‘Every	circle	filled	with	specks,	dots	of	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thousands	in	every	circle.	Deep	space,	Man.	You	know	what	those	specks	are?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	looked	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Galaxies,	Man.	Like	ours.	Each	speck.’	He	lowered	his	arm	lovingly,	like	a conductor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Hey	Professor,	shut	the	fuck	up.	We’re	going.	C’mon.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	pulled	a	dollar	from	his	wallet	and	held	it	out.	‘Where	did	you	go	to school,	Professor?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guy	accepted	the	dollar,	leaned	closer,	and	said,	‘A	whale	ship	was	my	Yale College	and	my	Harvard.’	He	winked	and	joined	the	group	straggling	up	the sidewalk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	reached	in	his	pocket	for	his	keys.	Where	the	hell	was	that	from’	Moby Dick’	He	started	the	car	and	drove	toward	home,	slightly	dazed.	Each	galaxy’a hundred	million	stars’	Enough	to	make	a	guy	feel	small.	‘I	got	one	for	you cheap,’	he	said	in	the	dark,	‘a	little	used,	a	dollar	a	star.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a><b class="calibre3">10</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	morning	Charley	called	the	Bureau	of	Vital	Records	in	New	York	and requested	an	application	for	a	birth	certificate	replacement.	Then	he	ordered	a telephone.	Electricity	was	included	in	his	rent.	What	should	he	do	for	a	second utility	bill’	He	asked	Bob	if	he	could	get	cable	TV	installed.	‘Be	my	guest,’	Bob said,	‘You	pay.	I	got	Nebraska	and	ten	points	this	weekend.	What	you	think?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Easy.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘O.K.	Lucky	Ray.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cable	company	scheduled	an	installation	for	the	following	Tuesday.	We	will bill	you,	they	told	him.	Good.	He	bought	a	thirteen	inch	color	TV. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Saturday	was	rainy;	the	work	to	the	building	was	postponed.	He	went	to	a	sports bar	and	watched	Nebraska	win	by	two	touchdowns.	By	Wednesday	noon,	both the	telephone	and	the	cable	TV	were	installed.	He	went	out	and	came	back	to find	a	letter	lying	on	his	doormat.	It	was	from	the	New	York	Department	of Health.	Hot	damn! </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	filled	the	form	out	carefully.	Maria	Gianelli,	he	printed.	He	felt	an	odd warmth	toward	this	woman	he’d	never	met.	He	bought	a	money	order	and	made it	out	to	the	Bureau	of	Vital	Records,	signing	it,	Ray	Jackson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	utility	bills	arrived	two	weeks	later.	He	made	copies	and	sent	the	originals together	with	the	application	and	money	order	from	the	main	post	office	by certified	mail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three	weeks	later,	he	sat	on	his	bed,	holding	a	letter	from	the	Bureau	in	his	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	afraid	to	open	it.	He	placed	it	squarely	on	the	corner	of	the	bed	and walked	to	the	window.	A	tree	with	large,	almost	horizontal,	limbs	shaded	the area	in	front	of	the	garage.	A	smaller	house	beyond	the	garage	completed	the compound.	The	patriarch	of	the	Wu	family	was	slowly	raking	leaves	from	the blacktop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	back	to	the	bed,	took	a	deep	breath,	and	opened	the	letter.	Raymond Jackson	jumped	out	at	him,	printed	on	stiff	green	paper.	Born:	April	9,	1952.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>certificate	was	perforated	with	a	fancy	seal,	City	of	New	York.	Done.	He	didn’t know	whether	he	felt	like	cheering	or	crying.	He	did	what	he	usually	did	when he	was	uncertain;	he	went	out	to	eat.	He	walked	to	the	Ilikai	Marina	and	had shrimp	cocktail,	prime	rib,	and	plenty	of	beer,	feeling	more	like	Ray	Jackson	as the	evening	went	along.	He	had	the	birth	certificate—something	solid	to	build on.	In	the	morning,	he’d	make	copies,	keep	one	in	his	wallet,	and	put	the	original in	a	safe	place.	Boats	rocked	in	the	marina.	Customers	came	and	wentas	night fell.	It	wasn’t	his	city	yet,	but	he	felt	more	at	home	than	he	had	anywhere	since he’d	left	Maine,	lying	in	the	back	of	Darlene’s	truck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	morning,	he	woke	with	a	small	hangover	and	went	out	for	coffee	and	a newspaper.	When	he	came	back,	Bob	was	standing	by	the	garage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Lucky	Ray,	you	just	in	time.’	Bob	pointed	to	a	truck	backing	toward	the	end	of the	garage,	loaded	with	lumber. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Hey,	all	right!’	He	ran	up	the	stairs	and	dropped	his	paper	on	the	small	table	by the	window.	Four	Wu’s	were	already	unloading	pressure	treated	2x6’s,	2x10’s, and	long	4x4’s.	He	trotted	down	and	began	to	help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	eldest	Wu	watched	while	they	stacked	the	lumber	in	separate	piles.	The youngest,	eleven	or	twelve,	was	sent	for	an	extension	cord.	The	elder	opened	a door	in	the	end	of	the	garage	and	directed	the	boy,	pointing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	other	end	of	the	garage	had	a	window	by	the	stairs	but	no	door.	He wondered	what	they	would	do	about	the	door	in	this	end.	A	few	words	were exchanged.	Suddenly,	they	were	all	squatting	in	a	circle,	considering	the	design. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several	ideas	were	weighed.	They	agreed	on	a	stairway	that	began	at	the	back and	reversed	direction	at	a	landing,	allowing	access	to	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	stood	at	once	and	began	to	work.	Bob’s	brother,	Henry,	was	in	charge of	layout.	He	worked	by	eye,	using	a	chalkline	to	strike	the	outline	of	the	stairs against	the	garage	siding.	Lucky	Ray	dug	shallow	holes	and	set	flat	concrete blocks	for	footings.	They	built	the	landing	first,	a	little	more	than	a	third	of	the way	up.	It	changed	the	end	of	the	garage	in	a	pleasing	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cindy,	Bob’s	wife,	served	lunch	on	their	screened	lanai,	and	then	they	were	at	it again.	There	was	more	pointing	than	talking.	They	seemed	to	have	a	code,	an anti-bullshit	pact.	It	wasn’t	fun,	exactly,	working	with	them,	but	it	was satisfying.	They	were	done	by	dark.	Several	of	the	Wu’s	nodded	at	him	when</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>they	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	began	putting	on	the	roofing	panels	that	would	keep	the	upper	walkway	dry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	pleasant	on	Bob’s	stepladder,	head	and	shoulders	up	through	the	rafters, hammering	the	nails	just	so,	little	rubber	washers	sealing	the	holes.	He	stopped when	he	was	half	done	and	studied	the	health	insurance	form.	For	occupation,	he wrote:	self	employed	handyman.	He	had	no	health	problems.	His	last	tetanus shot	was	junior	year	in	high	school	when	he	cut	his	foot	on	a	piece	of	barbed wire.	Pretty	stupid,	running	through	that	field	barefoot.	Chasing	Ginny	down.	He didn’t	get	her	that	day,	but	he	did	later	that	summer.	He	softened	and	began	to feel	lonely.	The	hard	place	straightened	him.	She’s	better	off.	So	am	I,	come down	to	it.	He	put	the	good	times	behind	him	and	finished	filling	out	the	form. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	went	down	the	hill	for	a	plate	of	fried	rice	and	was	home	in	time	to	watch Hawaii	get	beaten	by	B.Y.U.	in	a	close	basketball	game.	The	Rainbows	had	a pretty	good	team,	some	local	guys,	a	few	players	recruited	from	the	mainland. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	morning	was	bright	and	sunny.	He	took	the	insurance	application	to Kaiser	Clinic,	paid	the	fee,	and	was	back	on	the	stepladder	by	ten-thirty.	He relaxed	against	a	rafter	and	let	his	eyes	take	in	the	greenery	covering	the	steep hillside—trees,	vines,	branches,	leaves	of	many	shapes	and	sizes.	He	became aware	of	something	on	a	branch,	something	brown	which	came	gradually	into focus’a	lizard,	immobile,	larger	than	a	gecko.	He	watched	it	and	blinked.	He waited,	blinked	again.	It	was	changing	color.	Almost	imperceptibly,	it	was lightening,	turning	green.	A	chameleon,	he	realized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	didn’t	move.	The	sun	beat	down.	The	air	was	drowsy.	The	chameleon became	fully	green	and	jumped.	He	almost	missed	it,	had	to	look	hard	to	find	it, motionless	on	a	broad	green	leaf,	exactly	the	same	shade.	I’ll	be	damned,	He thought.	It	changed	before	it	jumped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	future	was	coming	at	him.	The	health	insurance	photo	ID	would	be	mailed in	three	weeks.	Maybe	a	month	after	that	he’d	have	a	social	security	card.	He’d be	home	free	then.	Take	a	driver’s	test	and	open	a	bank	account.	He	needed	to get	a	job. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People	were	going	to	ask	questions.	He	had	to	get	his	story	straight,	so	that	he wouldn’t	tell	one	person	one	thing	and	somebody	else	something	different. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	another	Heineken.	He	didn’t	want	to	make	up	a	lot	of	stuff	about	his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>past;	it	was	too	hard	to	remember.	As	long	as	he	didn’t	get	fingerprinted,	he’d	be O.K.	He	probably	wouldn’t	run	into	anyone	who	would	recognize	him.	If	he	did, he	might	see	the	other	person	first	and	be	able	to	turn	around.	He	thought	about dyeing	his	hair	and	growing	a	mustache,	but	it	wasn’t	his	style. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	tell	people	as	little	as	possible	about	his	past.	When	it	was	unavoidable, he’d	stick	close	to	the	truth,	using	first	names	only.	Who	was	going	to	check	up on	him’	He	wasn’t	going	to	apply	for	a	job	with	the	F.B.I. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	let	out	a	deep	breath.	It	was	like	getting	himself	back.	He	was	still	himself; he	just	had	a	different	name.	It	was	a	pain	in	the	ass,	but	he	was	getting	used	to it.	Not	going	home	was	the	tough	part.	Remember	Jimmy’	Three	years	for dealing.	Came	out	forty	pounds	heavier	with	a	mean	look.	He	shook	his	head, finished	his	beer,	paid,	and	walked	into	the	warm	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a><b class="calibre3">11</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Larsen	looked	him	over.	‘This	Walker—he’s	making	us	look	bad.’	Roland nodded	again.	‘You	run	him	down,	it	would	look	good	on	your	record.	I	could justify	a	raise	in	grade.	Probably	you	could	use	the	extra	money.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘For	sure,’	Roland	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Larsen	tapped	his	fingers	together.	‘So,	go	ahead,	put	some	extra	time	in	on	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	need	anything,	let	me	know.	He’s	out	there	somewhere;	he’ll	be	coming back,	getting	in	touch.	They	always	do.	That’s	when	we’ll	get	him.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Right,’	Roland	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later,	he	told	Theresa	at	dinner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	not	saying	we	couldn’t	use	the	money,’	she	said.	‘But	you	can’t	buy	old friends.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Or	me,	either,’	Roland	said.	‘Still—it’s	my	job.	Larsen	thinks	Charley’ll	come back	and	get	caught.	I	don’t	think	so.	I	hope	he’s	having	a	good	time	somewhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Charley’s	worth	three	of	Larsen.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	got	that	right.’	The	kids	were	getting	rowdy.	She	leaned	toward	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Shush	now,	I’m	getting	dessert.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	know	what,	Beautiful—let	me	do	it.	Ice	cream,	coming	up!’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a><b class="calibre3">12</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	stopped	for	breakfast	at	Moody’s	in	Waldoboro,	a	gateway	to	Down	East. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	always	ate	there,	adjusting	to	a	different	pace,	expanding	into	his	other	life where	he	was	Harry,	not	the	George	kid	who	lived	in	Cumberland.	He	was Magnum	Enterprises. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Magnum	Enterprises	was	a	bank	account	in	Grand	Cayman	and	his	Halliburton briefcase.	He	glanced	at	the	dull	shine	of	the	aluminum	briefcase	and	its combination	lock.	Impervious.	Ten	percent	skimmed	from	the	restaurant	and	the convenience	store	added	up	nicely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	for	established	businesses	whose	owners	were	hanging	on	until	they could	retire.	He	offered	them	a	segue	into	retirement,	buying	the	properties	and the	business,	allowing	them	to	stay	on	and	run	the	business	without	worry.	Often they	weren’t	ready	to	give	up	what	they’d	been	doing	for	so	long,	but	the	cash for	the	business	and	the	down	payment	on	the	property	sometimes	closed	the deal.	Magnum	gave	them	half	of	the	profit,	made	the	mortgage	and	insurance payments,	and	kept	the	books.	They	were	working	for	him,	really,	but	it	didn’t feel	like	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mort,	in	Portland,	handled	the	books	and	taxes.	He	was	a	legitimate	accountant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	nobody’s	business	how	much	he	charged	Harry	and	how	much	he	got	in envelopes	twice	a	year.	Harry’s	motto	was:	Everybody	wins	but	the	I.R.S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	pleased	when	he	left	Moody’s.	Thinking	things	over	was	work,	a	kind	of maintenance	that	needed	to	be	done	regularly.	Buying	Jed’s	had	been	a	good deal.	Jed	started	the	place,	built	it	himself	twenty-five	years	ago—first	the	clam shack,	then	the	addition.	Good	view	of	the	marina	and	harbor.	Finest	kind	clams, fried	shrimp,	lobster.	The	drive	up	was	business,	but	it	was	always	good	to	visit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	got	there,	Suzy,	the	waitress,	was	taking	a	smoke	break	in	front.	Four customers	were	lingering	at	a	corner	table.	Jed	was	cleaning	in	the	kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Here’s	for	you,’	Harry	said,	opening	his	briefcase.	He	flipped	an	envelope	onto the	counter	in	front	of	the	toaster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Thanks.’	Jed	put	the	envelope	in	his	back	pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>‘What’s	the	matter’	Hard	day?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Nah,	nothing.	Time	of	year,	I	guess.	Closing	next	week.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	can	kick	back,	man!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Well,	there’s	stuff	to	do	around	the	place.	You	know	how	it	is.	I	like	it	when people	come	in	to	eat.	Five	month	season—you’d	think	I’d	be	used	to	it	by	now.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Maybe	you	should	take	off	for	a	while.	Check	out	Florida	or	somewhere.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘The	missus	wants	to	go	to	Bermuda.	She’s	been	reading.’	He	looked	at	Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What	am	I	going	to	do	in	Bermuda?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Get	some	shorts;	ride	a	bike	around;	play	croquet.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Shorts’	Croquet?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yeah,	it’s	a	game.	You	hit	a	wooden	ball	with	a	mallet.	Try	to	knock	it	through little	hoops	stuck	in	the	ground.	Wickets.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Sounds	exciting.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Brandy	Alexanders,’	Harry	said.	‘Two	or	three	of	those	and	it	gets	exciting.	I wouldn’t	mind.	Tell	you	what’I’ll	go	with	the	missus.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘That	a	promise?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	phone	rang.	‘O.K.,	be	right	there.’	He	hung	up	the	phone	and	wiped	his hands	on	his	apron.	‘I	got	to	go	do	something,	Harry.	Suzy	will	close.	See	you next	time.	The	bills	and	cash	are	in	the	safe.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Good.	Place	looks	good,	Jed.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jed	looked	around	at	the	clean	kitchen	and	nodded.	‘Oh,	I	almost	forgot’Marty wants	to	see	you,	over	at	the	Marina.	He	was	asking	when	you	were	coming	up.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No	problem,	Jed.	See	you	next	trip.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	drove	down	the	slope	to	the	marina.	The	only	person	he	saw	was	working on	a	boat	moored	to	the	main	dock.	Harry	approached	his	back.	‘Marty	around?’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a>A	tall	man	pulled	his	head	out	of	the	engine	compartment	and	cleaned	a	wrench with	a	rag.	‘Was,	last	time	I	knew.’	There	was	a	smudge	on	his	nose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Roomy	in	there,’	Harry	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘They	design	these	things	with	computers.	Might	be,	Marty’s	on	the	bridge.’	He pointed	to	a	large	window	on	the	second	floor.	‘Steps	are	on	the	right.	Bang	on the	door.’	He	adjusted	a	pair	of	small	vise-grips	and	leaned	over	the	engine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	climbed	the	stairs	and	knocked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Come	in,	Harry.’	Marty	was	sitting	at	a	desk	overlooking	the	marina.	‘Saw	you coming.	Have	a	seat.’	Marty	was	burly.	His	eyes	were	dark,	close	together.	He had	a	two	day	growth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Good	view,’	Harry	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Keep	an	eye	on	things.	You	know	how	it	is.	You	want	a	cup	of	coffee	or something’	Shot	of	the	finest’	Beer?’	Harry	poured	himself	coffee	and	sat	on	a leather	couch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘So,	what’s	happening?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Glad	you	came	by,	Harry.	Glad	you	came	by.’	Marty	lowered	his	voice	and leaned	toward	him.	‘I	got	a	deal	for	you.’	Harry	waited.	‘I’m	going	to	expand.	I want	Jed’s.	I’ll	give	you	a	hundred	grand	for	the	business	and	the	property. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here’s	the	kicker—half	cash.	Fucking	idiots	in	Washington	got	enough	of	our money,	know	what	I	mean’	Whaddya	say?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Cash	talks.	What	about	Jed?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	take	care	of	him.	Don’t	worry	about	it.	My	problem.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘One-fifty,	half	cash,	10G	up	front.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What!	You	little	prick.	You’re	going	to	make	me	shell	out	a	hundred	twenty-five	grand	for	that	shack.’	Marty	shook	his	head	admiringly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Make	that	one-sixty,’	Harry	said.	Marty’s	eyes	narrowed.	‘You’ve	got	to	figure,’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	said,	‘which	would	be	happier—telling	me	to	fuck	off	or	owning	this	side</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>of	the	harbor.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Marty	made	up	his	mind.	‘Wait	for	me	downstairs.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	went	down	to	the	first	floor	and	stood	in	the	doorway.	Things	were looking	good.	There	was	a	little	singing	in	his	ears.	Marty	appeared	five	minutes later	and	held	up	a	manila	envelope.	‘One-fifty-four.	Here’s	ten	thousand,	sixty-seven	more	in	cash	when	we	close.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	considered.	He’d	made	his	point.	Always	good	to	let	the	other	guy	have the	last	word.	‘Deal,’	he	said.	‘When	do	you	want	to	close?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	be	in	Portland	a	week	from	Friday.	That	give	you	enough	time?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yep.	The	deed’s	clear.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	know,’	Marty	said.	‘Straight	sale,	as	is—business,	all	assets	and	property, seventy-seven	thousand	on	the	books.’	Harry	gave	him	one	of	Mort’s	cards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Solid.	See	you	here,	at	Mort’s’right	off	Exchange	Street.	One	o’clock,	Friday?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Marty	looked	at	the	card	and	put	it	in	his	wallet.	‘Right.	If’this	doesn’t	go through,	one	of	my	reps	will	be	looking	you	up.’	Fucking	neanderthal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No	problemo.	See	you	next	Friday.’	Marty	went	upstairs,	and	Harry	locked	the cash	in	his	briefcase.	He	drove	past	Jed	who	was	back,	raking	in	front	of	the restaurant.	Jed	straightened,	expecting	to	talk,	but	Harry	smiled,	waved,	and	kept going.	Jed	was	going	to	have	to	work	out	his	own	deal	with	Marty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	way	to	Flat’s	Cove,	Harry	reviewed	the	deal.	There	was	no	pre-payment penalty	in	the	mortgage.	After	closing	costs,	he	was	going	to	have	at	least	ninety thousand,	seventy-seven	under	the	table.	On	paper,	he’d	show	a	small	loss	that would	come	in	handy	at	tax	time.	He’d	put	sixty	into	it	and	skimmed	most	of that	back	off	the	top.	Not	bad	for	a	three	year	investment.	A	little	less	than	three years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	Monday	afternoon,	Harry	had	Marty’s	deal	ready	to	go	and	had	negotiated another	five	thousand	on	an	offer	for	his	house	in	Carrabassett.	He	wasn’t looking	forward	to	the	soup	kitchen,	but	everything	else	was	moving	along	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	put	on	jeans	and	a	green	sweatshirt	and	reported. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>‘You	Dale?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	am.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Community	service	calls.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Just	in	time,	Sweetheart.	You	must	be	Harry,	the	answer	to	my	prayer.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dale	was	six-three,	at	least,	broad	shouldered.	He	pointed	to	a	stainless	steel counter	and	a	heap	of	pots	and	pans	piled	next	to	a	large	sink.	‘If	you	could	start with	those,	it	would	be	marvelous.	There	are	kitchen	gloves	in	the	supply cabinet,	there.’	Harry	looked	at	the	pile.	‘I	know.	I	know,’	Dale	said.	‘You	think, I’ll	never	be	finished.	But	if	you	do	them	one	at	a	time	and	don’t	think	about	it—</p>
<p class="calibre1">after	awhile,	you’re	done.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Jesus,’	Harry	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	play	power	music,’	Dale	said.	‘We’ll	have	some	nice	pie,	after.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	worse	than	Harry	thought;	the	sink,	too,	was	filled	with	baking	pans, mixing	bowls,	long	handled	spoons	and	ladles—anything	that	couldn’t	fit	in	a dishwasher.	He	pulled	on	rubber	gloves,	a	size	too	large,	as	Jimmy	Cliff	and	a reggae	beat	filled	the	kitchen.	The	harder	they	come,	the	harder	they	fall,	one and	all	‘	He	picked	up	a	scouring	pad	and	a	small	frying	pan,	turned	on	the water,	and	began	scrubbing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	worked,	as	Dale	said,	as	long	as	he	didn’t	think	about	it.	When	he	started	to think,	to	talk	to	himself,	he	began	to	panic.	He	was	trapped.	He	wanted	to	run out	the	door.	He	could	claim	some	kind	of	crisis	or	personality	problem	with Dale.	He	could	talk	his	way	into	a	different	community	service,	but—would	it	do any	good’	It	might	be	worse,	although	that	was	hard	to	imagine.	He	set	his	jaw and	became	a	scrubbing	machine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jimmy	Cliff,	Bob	Marley,	two	hours	later,	Harry	rinsed	a	huge	mashed	potato pot	and	took	off	the	gloves.	‘Next	time,’	Dale	suggested,	‘with	that	potato	pot—</p>
<p class="calibre1">start	out	with	cold	water.	Potatoes,	rice,	pasta’cold	first,	then	hot.	Harry,	they	are beautiful,	beautiful.	They	gleam.’	He	brought	a	pie	dish	from	the	cooler	and served	two	pieces	at	a	wooden	table.	‘Billy	makes	a	good	pie.’	Harry	got	a	cup of	coffee	and	adjusted	his	chair	so	that	he	couldn’t	see	the	sink. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>‘I	like	a	cup	of	tea	at	night,’	Dale	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	chewed	and	pointed	at	the	pie	with	his	fork.	‘Pretty	good.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Didn’t	I	tell	you?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘So,	what	do	you	do,	Dale,	besides	work	in	here?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Oh’I	have	my	position	to	uphold.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What	position	is	that?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	the	largest	queen	in	Portland.	And	I	have	my	collections.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Collections?’	Harry	took	another	bite	of	pie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Oh,	yes.	Nothing	much,	really.	Kilims.	And	my	Georgia	O’Keefe	memorabilia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	not	so	much	into	that	now.	Kilims,	God!	I’ve	spent	everything	on	them.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What’s	a	kilim?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘A	small	rug,	hand	woven,	usually	wool.	Unbelievable	colors.	Traditional patterns	from	Turkey,	Iran,	the	Causcasus,	places	like	that.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Where	do	you	buy	them?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Dealers.	I	went	to	Turkey	once	with	Ringo.	We	found	some	beauties.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Do	you	ever	sell	them?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Only	when	I	absolutely	have	to’to	buy	a	better	one.	Sometimes	you	simply can’t	resist.’	Dale	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugs.	Who	would	have	guessed.	Everyone	has	a	weakness,	something	they	want that	will	make	everything	all	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Can	you	get	a	decent	one	for	a	thousand	bucks?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Oh	yes,	if	you	know	what	you’re	doing.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Dale,	I’ve	been	thinking.	I’ve	got	a	lot	to	do	in	the	next	couple	of	months.	A	lot</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>to	do.	I’m	thinking	about	a	deal	here.	If	you	could	find	someone	to	pull	my shifts,	I	could	pay	for	him	and	get	you	something	for	being	the	contractor.	I’m thinking	a	thousand	bucks	for	the	labor	and	a	thousand	for	a	kilim.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dale	leaned	back	in	his	chair.	‘My,	aren’t	you	the	hustler.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘That	would	be	up	front.	Then,	when	you	sign	my	form	in	ten	weeks,	another thousand	for	the	collection.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What	if	Pete	checks	on	you?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘At	night’	Never	happen.	He’s	a	family	man.	Anyway,	if	he	did’a	hundred	to one,	he	won’t’I’m	sick	and	you	got	a	sub.	Just	call	me	and	let	me	know.	How about	it?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Hmm.	I	don’t	know.	Well,	O.K.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘We	have	a	deal’	Good.	Tomorrow	night	I’ll	bring	the	two	thousand.	You	take care	of	the	other	guy;	handle	that	any	way	you	want.	I	see	a	killer	kilim;	it’s waiting	for	you.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yes,	well,	it	is	hard	to	resist	your	enthusiasm.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yeah,	you	got	a	passion	for	kilims;	I	have	passions,	too.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Not	for	dishes,’	Dale	said.	He	was	a	likeable	dude,	really.	Comfortable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Probably	something	to	do	with	being	big.	‘In	the	meantime,’	Dale	went	on,	‘that is	to	say,	until	ten,	there	are	those	potatoes.’	He	pointed	to	a	sack	in	the	corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘If	you	would	peel	them	and	put	them	in	that	blue	tub	with	some	water,	I’ll	make a	few	calls.’	Fair	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dale	went	into	a	small	office	and	emerged	half	an	hour	later.	‘Ringo	is	too	lazy,’</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	said.	‘I	tried	Pele;	she	was	quite	rude.	Larry	said	no,	but	he	suggested	Daniel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marvelous!	Daniel	is	pleased	to	have	the	work.	You’re	a	free	man,	Harry’if you’ll	just	be	good	enough	to	finish	those	potatoes.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	evening,	at	quarter	to	six,	Harry	handed	Dale	a	copy	of	Antique Collectors	Digest	with	an	envelope	jammed	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Where’s	Daniel?’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>‘He’ll	be	here	any	minute.	Daniel	is	very	punctual.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Good	man,’	Harry	said.	‘I’ll	see	you	in	ten	weeks.	Enjoy	the	kilim.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yes,	and	thank	you	for	the	magazine.	Enjoy	your	freedom.’	He	seemed	to	mean it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	mother	was	reading	in	the	living	room.	‘Hello,	Dear,’	she	said,	‘how	was your	day?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	have	prevailed.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘It	is	the	way	of	the	George’s,’	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What’cha	reading?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Balzac.’	She	lifted	the	leather	bound	volume	slightly.	‘Pere	Goriot.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Oh,	good.	Nothing	heavy.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	might	try	Balzac,	Harry.	Your	mind	wouldn’t	wilt.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘It’s	too	late,	Mother.	The	killer	weed.’	She	fought	back	a	smile.	He	seized	the moment.	‘There’s	someone	I’d	like	you	to	meet.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘That	woman	you’ve	been	seeing,	I	suppose.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Lynn.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Lynn.	Very	well.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	was	thinking	about	dinner,	maybe	Friday?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Ethel	is	taking	Friday	off.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Not	here.	The	Galley,	perhaps?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yes.	Well.	That	will	be	very	nice,	Dear.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	make	reservations,’	Harry	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>‘Very	nice.’	She	was	reading	already. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You’d	better	get	back	to	Paris,’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Good	night,	Dear.	Friday.	Yes.	Very	nice.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	went	up	to	his	room	and	called	Lynn.	She	was	excited.	Maybe	it	wouldn’t be	so	bad.	Better	not	to	think	about	it.	He	turned	on	the	TV. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	Friday	he	had	scrounged	enough	cash	to	pay	off	the	mortgage	on	Jed’s.	He was	out	of	cash,	but	Marty	would	make	him	well	in	a	hurry.	Mort	had	the	paper work	under	control.	They	would	slide	the	deed	and	keys	to	Marty;	he	would slide	them	a	check	and	an	envelope.	Mort	would	hand	over	a	file	box	that contained	the	business	records	along	with	a	couple	of	diskettes.	Harry	would walk	to	the	bank	and	make	a	deposit.	Magnum	would	be	primed	for	the	next deal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	went	as	he	expected,	although	Marty	wasn’t	a	bundle	of	laughs.	He	didn’t think	much	about	the	dinner	until	he	picked	up	Lynn.	He	was	surprised	to	see	her in	a	straight	skirt	and	black	cashmere	sweater.	‘Are	those	pearls?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">She	tossed	her	hair.	‘You	like?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Amazing!	Couldn’t	we	skip	dinner	and	just	start	taking	things	off?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	borrowed	the	pearls.’	She	took	a	wool	coat	from	a	closet.	‘I	didn’t	have	a decent	coat.	I	found	this	one	at	Amaryllis.’	It	was	the	color	of	brick	and	fallen leaves,	complementing	her	auburn	hair	and	the	black	sweater. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘We’ll	pick	up	mumsie	on	the	way.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s	mother	was	waiting	and	stepped	outside	as	they	drove	in.	He	and	Lynn got	out	of	the	car,	meeting	her	on	the	walk.	‘Mother’Lynn.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	so	glad	to	meet	you,	Mrs.	George.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Elizabeth,	for	God’s	sake.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Elizabeth.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>‘Mother	is	known	for	getting	to	the	point.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘It	is	true	that	I	am	Mrs.	George,’	she	said,	getting	into	the	back	seat.	‘But	it	is more	true	that	I	am	Elizabeth.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Wouldn’t	you	be	more	comfortable	in	front?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘This	is	perfectly	fine,	Dear.	I’d	ride	in	a	donkey	cart	to	get	to	salmon	and	a	nice drink.’	Dear.	Harry	didn’t	understand	how	it	had	happened,	but	his	mother	and Lynn	seemed	to	have	already	reached	an	understanding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dinner	was	a	female	affair.	His	mother	told	stories	about	the	little	Harry	and desisted	from	discussing	great	literary	works.	There	was	an	uncomfortable moment	after	Lynn	explained	that	she	was	studying	music	history	and	was	asked if	she	played	an	instrument.	‘Piano’but	not	very	well.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">His	mother	paused	as	though	the	answer	didn’t	translate	into	any	of	her languages.	She	brightened.	‘I’m	sure	you	play	very	well.	I	don’t	play	at	all.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	played	the	penny	whistle,’	Harry	said,	‘until	Father	broke	it.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lynn	smiled.	‘How	can	you	break	a	penny	whistle?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Over	your	knee,’	Harry	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Your	father	does	have	a	temper	at	times.	Although	he	has	mellowed’wouldn’t you	say?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	made	a	face.	Yeah,	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lynn	said,	‘I	met’Ben’right	here.	He	was	very	charming.’	Harry	wondered	if	his parents	had	talked	about	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	mother	said,	‘I’m	so	glad	to	get	to	know	you,’	with	over	the	top	sincerity	that made	his	teeth	itch	but	seemed	to	put	Lynn	at	ease. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dessert	went	on	for	some	time.	Harry	made	a	point	of	paying.	His	mother	made a	point	of	thanking	him.	Lynn	and	his	mother	said	their	goodbyes	in	the	car,	and he	walked	his	mother	to	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a>‘She’s	very	nice,	Dear,’	his	mother	said.	‘But	I	will	remind	you	that	you	must	lie in	the	bed	you	make.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Thanks	for	the	reminder.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Good	night,	Dear.	It	was	a	lovely	dinner.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	was	halfway	down	the	drive	before	Lynn	said,	‘Well,	what	did	she	say?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘She	said	you	were	very	nice.’	Lynn	hesitated,	weighing	his	tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	think	she’s	just	fine,’	she	said.	She	put	her	hand	on	his	leg.	‘Guess	who’s	not home	this	weekend?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Mmmm,	maybe	I’ll	stay	awhile,’	he	said,	stopping	in	front	of	her	house.	‘I’ve got	to	get	another	place	one	of	these	days.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘The	house	in	Carrabassett	is	too	far	away,	isn’t	it?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	sold	it.	Closing	the	end	of	this	month.	I	didn’t	go	up	all	that	often,	but	even when	I	rented	it’it	was	still	mine.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Well,	mi	casa,	su	casa’tonight	anyway.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Tough	choice	between	you	and	the	Celtics.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	can	have	both.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">He	watched	the	third	quarter	while	she	changed	and	cleaned	up	in	the	kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	bounced	down	beside	him	on	the	couch,	bathrobe	falling	away	from	one knee	and	leg.	‘How’s	the	game?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘In	the	bag,	Celtics	up	fourteen.’	He	moved	sideways	and	bent	his	head	to	her leg.	He	felt	with	his	teeth	for	the	muscle	along	the	top	while	he	traced	with	a finger	the	soft	underside	of	her	leg.	Her	hand	went	to	the	back	of	his	neck.	He turned	his	head,	resting	his	cheek	on	her	leg.	His	hands	rose	to	her	breasts.	Her bathrobe	opened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	followed	the	long	curve	of	her	body	down	to	her	hips,	his	hands	separating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	move.	His	head	slid	up	her	legs,	into	the	cleft	between	them	and	then</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a>over	the	flat	smooth	swell	of	her	belly	to	one	breast	and	then	the	other.	He	was on	his	knees	now.	He	shut	his	eyes	and	pushed	her	over	on	the	couch;	he	didn’t want	to	see	her	face;	he	wanted	her	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	undid	his	belt	and	pushed	his	pants	down	as	he	moved	over	her.	He	was	hard and	heavy,	pinning	her	to	the	couch,	fucking	her	deliberately.	She	wanted	it.	She was	there	to	be	fucked.	She	was	supposed	to	be	fucked.	She	took	it	and	took	it, digging	fingernails	into	him,	gasping	harder	and	harder	until	he	came,	filling	her with	what	felt	like	his	collapsing	will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stroked	his	back	and	made	soothing	sounds.	He	heard	Johnny	Most,	the Celtics’	announcer,	shouting	in	disbelief	at	a	bad	call.	‘Let’s	go	to	bed,’	Harry said,	pulling	slowly	out	of	her	and	rising	awkwardly.	He	turned	off	the	TV,	went into	her	bedroom,	and	crawled	between	cool	sheets. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a><b class="calibre3">13</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Ray	walked	to	an	address	at	the	intersection	of	Kalakaua	and	Kapiolani,	a	gas station	on	the	Diamond	Head	corner.	A	cream	colored	delivery	van	was	parked at	one	edge	of	the	lot.	Several	Dodge	Darts	with	taxi	roof	lights	were	angled	next to	the	van.	Inside	the	garage,	another	Dart,	white	like	the	others,	was	up	on	a	lift. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	middle-aged	man	was	working	on	the	brakes.	Ray	asked	about	the	cab company.	The	mechanic	pointed	at	the	van.	Ray	nodded	and	walked	over.	He was	getting	used	to	new	ways.	Why	talk	when	you	can	point’	Why	answer	when you	can	nod’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Next	to	the	van	door	was	a	painted	sign:	‘Archer	is.’	Next	to	that,	behind	a	clear plastic	shield,	was	a	card	that	read,	‘In.’	Ray	rapped	on	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Come	in.’	A	large	haole	with	a	pleasant	face	was	sitting	at	a	desk	covered	with papers	and	folders.	He	was	talking	on	a	phone.	‘Just	a	moment.’	The	van	was organized	as	an	office	and	small	meeting	room’a	bookshelf,	a	narrow	counter,	a tape	player,	a	trash	can	nearly	filled	with	empty	coffee	cups,	photographs	and	a map	of	Honolulu	on	the	wall.	‘What	can	I	do	for	you?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	looking	for	a	job.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Have	you	driven	before’	I’m	Archer,	by	the	way.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Ray,	Ray	Jackson.	Not	a	cab.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Archer	looked	him	over.	‘First	time	for	everything.’	He	had	a	tan	and	an	aloha shirt,	the	easy	look	of	the	islands,	but	his	voice	was	mainland,	east	coast	with	the edges	worn	off.	‘We	have	a	good	training	program.	Where	are	you	from?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Maine.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Down	East,’	Archer	said.	‘I	did	summer	stock	in	Maine.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Summer	stock?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Acting’in	the	summer	theaters’off	Broadway.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	were	an	actor.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>‘Of	sorts.	I’m	afraid	I	never	quite	made	it.	And,	it’s	so	cold	in	New	York.	Why do	you	want	to	drive?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	need	the	money.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Ah,’	Archer	said.	‘That’s	why	I	got	into	it.’	He	looked	out	a	window	in	the	end of	the	van.	‘Here’s	Dean.’	He	stood	and	opened	the	door.	A	stocky	guy	about Ray’s	age	came	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Dean,	this	is	Ray.	He	wants	to	drive	with	us.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dean	took	another	look	at	him.	‘Why	not?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Maybe	you	could	take	him	out	for	an	hour,	show	him	our	way	of	doing	things.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Will	do.	21	isn’t	charging.	Belt’s	O.K.,	probably	the	alternator.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘All	right,	I’ll	tell	Muni.	Why	don’t	you	take	32?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Right	on.	Let’s	go.’	He	looked	at	Ray. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Let’s	go,’	Ray	said.	He	got	into	the	front	seat,	and	Dean	waited	for	a	chance	to turn	up	Kalakaua. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘So,	where	you	from?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Maine.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yeah’	I’m	from	Cleveland.	Just	outside	of	Cleveland.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Holiday	Mart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dean	reached	for	a	microphone	under	the	dash.	‘32.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">32,	240	Kaheka. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Ten	four,	240	Kaheka.’	He	hung	up	the	mike	and	backed	across	the	lot	to	the Kapiolani	side.	‘Over	by	the	Pagoda,’	he	said.	A	neatly	dressed	woman	waiting on	the	sidewalk	smiled	at	Dean	as	he	leaped	out	of	the	cab	and	held	the	door	for her.	She	gave	him	an	address. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p63"></a>‘32’</p>
<p class="calibre1">32.	The	dispatcher	had	a	rich	voice	that	left	sweet	echoes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘240	Kaheka	to	2982	Alewa	Drive.	Mahalo.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Oooh,	32.’	Approval	floated	through	the	cab. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Alewa	Heights,’	Dean	said	to	Ray.	He	turned	his	head	to	the	woman.	‘How	are you	today?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Fine,	but	one	half	hour	late.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Traffic	is	light’we	make	good	time.	You	want	I	ask	the	dispatcher	to	call	for you,	say	you	on	your	way?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No	need.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dean	had	a	clipboard	and	a	map	of	the	city	on	the	seat	next	to	him.	While	they waited	at	an	intersection,	he	made	an	entry	on	the	clipboard.	They	drove	across town	and	high	into	a	residential	neighborhood.	From	time	to	time,	the	dispatcher gave	a	location,	followed	a	short	time	later	by	instructions	to	another	driver, closest	to	the	pickup	point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	city	spread	out	behind	them;	the	Pacific	reached	farther	and	farther	as	they climbed.	Dean	slowed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘This	one,’	she	said.	He	turned	off	the	meter	and	stopped	by	a	low	house	with	a tile	roof.	Most	of	the	house	was	hidden	behind	a	stuccoed	wall.	Bougainvillae hung	from	a	wooden	trellis	that	framed	an	entry	in	the	wall.	Dean	opened	the door	for	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	going	to	need	a	ride	back?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Three	o’clock,’	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	be	here.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Better	I	call’in	case	things	change.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘O.K.,	mahalo.’	He	took	the	money,	waved,	and	got	back	in	the	cab.	Ray</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>watched	the	woman	walk	under	the	flowers.	Her	shoulders	seemed	tired.	The flowers,	the	quiet,	the	green	with	the	ocean	beyond,	the	woman	with	some	kind of	problem,	her	back,	her	short	hair	elegantly	cut’time	stopped	for	a	moment.	He felt	that	his	life	could	open,	walking	behind	her	through	that	entry.	Would	open through	some	entry.	With	someone.	‘Good	load,’	Dean	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	they	drove	down	the	mountain,	Dean	explained	the	shifts:	‘Twelve	hours,	six to	six.	You	start	with	a	full	tank;	you	fill	up	at	the	end	of	the	shift.	You	turn	in	an envelope	with	the	beginning	meter	and	the	ending	meter.	You	subtract	them, divide	by	two,	and	write	that	down.	That’s	how	much	you	put	in	the	envelope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	company	gets	half	the	meter.	You	get	half	the	meter	and	all	the	tips.	You	pay to	fill	up	at	Muni’s.	You	turn	in	the	envelope,	and	that’s	it.	You’re	an independent	contractor.	No	taxes,	no	benefits.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	get	it.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Archer’s	good	to	work	for.	Top	three	drivers	every	month	get	a	free	shift.	You get	better	cabs	and	first	choice	of	shifts	after	you’ve	been	here	awhile.	Oh	yeah, if	you	break	down,	he’ll	pay	you	for	the	time	you	lost.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘All	right!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">An	elderly	man	at	a	corner	raised	his	arm.	Dean	hit	the	turn	signal	and	brakes	at the	same	time,	stopping	just	past	the	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Hotel	Street,’	the	man	said,	lowering	himself	into	the	back	seat.	Dean	pulled into	traffic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Downtown’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘32.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">32,	110	Queen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘110	Queen.’	He	put	down	the	mike.	‘We’ll	be	there	in	a	couple	of	minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hotel	Street	is	right	on	the	way.’	He	dropped	the	man	off.	On	Queen	Street,	they picked	up	an	airport	load.	Leaving	the	airport,	a	guy	flagged	them	down	from	the city	bus	stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yes!’	Dean	said.	He	looked	in	the	mirror.	‘We	aren’t	allowed	to	pick	up	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a>airport.	Sometimes	I’ll	take	a	chance.	This	is	a	SIDA	stop.	Only	SIDA	cabs	can pick	up	here.	They’ve	got	the	airport,	most	of	the	big	hotels.’	He	jumped	out	and opened	the	trunk	for	the	guy’s	suitcase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Ilikai,’	the	guy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Let’s	roll.’	Dean	got	in	and	said,	‘Charley’s	got	the	shopping	center,	Holiday Mart,	some	of	the	smaller	hotels,	lots	of	dispatch.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘So,	Archer’s	company	is	part	of	Charley’s?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Right.	We’ve	got	a	training	booklet	that	explains	all	this’how	to	get	your	cab license	and	all.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	passenger	leaned	toward	the	front	seat.	‘You	guys	make	any	money?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Sometimes,’	Dean	said.	‘Slow	now,	but	we’ll	pick	up	after	the	holidays.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	ought	to	quit	and	come	out	here;	that’s	what	I	ought	to	do.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Sure,’	Dean	said.	‘Come	on	out.	Or	just	stay,	throw	away	that	return	ticket.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	got	a	lady	wouldn’t	like	that.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘At	least	you	got	a	lady.	Bring	her,	too.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’d	have	to	bring	half	of	Wisconsin.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Wisconsin,’	Dean	said,	‘Packers,	man.	Green	Bay.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	Ilikai	came	into	sight,	the	man	said,	‘There	she	is.	I’m	ready	for	a	cold one.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Lucky	dog,’	Dean	said.	He	retrieved	the	man’s	suitcase	and	stuffed	bills	in	his pocket.	‘Mahalo.	Enjoy.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">He	got	back	in	the	cab	and	headed	for	Muni’s.	‘It	isn’t	this	good	all	the	time.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Back	in	the	van,	he	told	Archer,	‘Four	loads’Alewa	Heights	and	an	airport.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Dean’s	our	number	one,’	Archer	said	to	Ray.	‘In	fact,	he	wrote	this	booklet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here’s	everything	you	need	to	know.	Come	back	when	you	get	your	license; </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>we’ll	put	you	on	the	road.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ray	took	the	booklet.	‘Thanks.’	There	was	a	friendly	feeling	in	the	van,	a	group of	guys	pulling	something	off,	making	it	on	the	edges	of	the	system.	‘I’ll	be back.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wrote	‘Ray	Jackson’	in	a	new	notebook	and	sketched	Diamond	Head, glowing	green	from	recent	rain.	He	turned	over	a	page	and	laid	down	his ballpoint.	Christmas	was	next	week.	His	mom	would	miss	him.	And	Molly.	He used	to	always	get	Molly	a	good	present.	Ron,	the	kids.	Ron	wasn’t	a	bad	guy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wondered	how	his	father	was	doing.	Last	he’d	heard	was	a	card	saying	that he’d	moved	farther	north	in	Minnesota,	somewhere	up	near	the	border.	He	was still	with	Edna;	that	was	a	good	thing.	She	was	nice,	had	a	sweet	smile.	His father	kept	getting	farther	from	people,	not	like	his	mother.	It	wasn’t	that	he didn’t	like	people,	as	far	as	Ray	could	tell;	he	was	just	happier	in	the	woods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Never	did	talk	much.	He’d	understand,	though’taking	off’staying	free.	It	was	the closest	Ray	could	come	to	a	real	conversation’imagining	his	family,	hearing	their voices	in	his	mind.	He	looked	around.	There	wasn’t	anyone	he	really	wanted	to talk	to.	Time	to	go.	It	was	comfortable	at	the	Moana,	but	he	had	to	get	up	early in	the	morning,	first	day	of	driving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kalakaua	was	crowded	with	tourists	in	groups	of	three	and	four,	carrying shopping	bags,	talking	fast,	having	a	good	time	before	they	got	on	a	big	bird back	to	Tokyo	or	Des	Moines.	A	short	blonde	walked	toward	him	on	the sidewalk.	She	had	leis	hanging	on	one	arm	and	was	giving	them	away.	She	came toward	him	smiling,	forcing	him	to	stop.	She	reached	both	arms	over	and	behind his	head,	almost	a	hug.	Plumeria	brushed	his	cheek.	She	stepped	back.	His	eyes opened	at	the	sweetness	of	the	smell.	‘Aloha,’	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Aloha.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	eyes	lingered	on	his	for	a	moment,	and	then	she	stepped	around	him	and continued	down	the	sidewalk.	He	took	a	few	steps	and	stopped.	His	knees	began to	shake	and	suddenly	he	couldn’t	see.	He	was	crying	on	Kalakaua	Avenue.	He touched	the	plumeria	lei.	The	woman’s	warmth	was	all	over	him.	Last	of	the flower	children,	ten	years	out	of	date.	She	chose	me.	He	walked	unsteadily forward,	regaining	control	of	his	breathing.	He	wiped	his	eyes	and	shook	his head	feeling	weak	but	better,	as	though	a	fever	had	broken.	He	hadn’t	cried	since</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a>junior	high	school.	He	turned	to	look	for	the	woman,	but	she	was	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	morning,	Ray	was	at	Muni’s	by	ten	minutes	to	six.	Cabs	were	pulling in;	drivers	were	pumping	gas	and	turning	in	envelopes.	Archer	said	good morning	and	pointed	to	a	cab	parked	near	the	van.	‘Why	don’t	you	take	48?’	he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Good	deal.’	Ray	got	into	the	cab,	put	his	license	into	the	holder	on	the	sun	visor, and	started	the	engine.	He	adjusted	the	seat	and	mirrors,	turned	the	radio	on,	and headed	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	streets	were	sleepy	in	the	early	light.	The	dispatcher	called	a	location	on	the other	side	of	the	city.	Ray	had	no	idea	what	to	do.	It	was	too	early	to	wait	in	line at	the	shopping	center.	He	drove	down	King	Street	and	then	doubled	back	on Beretania.	A	guy	ran	in	front	of	the	cab	waving	his	arms.	He	jumped	into	the front	seat.	‘Fort	Shafter!	Got	to	get	there	by	6:45!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Where’s	Fort	Shafter?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Jesus,	keep	going!	I’ll	show	you.’	He	was	a	G.I.	who	had	to	be	on	base	in	time for	duty.	Ray	raced	to	Wahiawa,	just	making	it.	The	guy	gave	him	fifteen	bucks and	ran	from	the	cab. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ray	put	the	bills	in	his	shirt	pocket	and	made	an	entry	on	the	trip	sheet.	On	the way	back	to	Honolulu,	he	stopped	for	French	toast	and	sausage.	Not	bad,	he thought.	A	cab	was	a	whole	lot	better	than	jail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nearly	a	year	later,	Jim	Pizza	was	leaning	against	the	fender	of	Ray’s	cab	in front	of	Liberty	House	at	the	shopping	center.	‘So	what’s	the	best	load	you	ever got?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Fort	Shafter,’	Ray	said.	‘Damnedest	thing.	First	load	I	ever	got.	Six	in	the morning.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Not	counting	tours,	I	think	Kaneohe	was	my	best.’	Jim	Pizza	was	his	real	name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	from	New	York.	It	was	November,	a	slow	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What	did	you	do	in	New	York?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	was	a	musician.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>‘Yeah’	What	did	you	play?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Guitar.	Guitar	and	sing.	Used	to	play	on	the	street.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No	shit.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yeah,	it	was	cool.	Better	in	Europe,	though.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Europe?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘They	dig	musicians	over	there.	Stockholm,	Copenhagen’you	can	do	great around	the	holidays.	Good	looking	women.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	can’t	play	anything.	Why	did	you	stop?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	don’t	know’got	tired,	burned	out.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Too	bad.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No,	it	isn’t.	You	gotta	stop	sometimes,	try	new	things,	recharge.	I’m	going back.’	Jim	looked	out	over	the	parking	lot	to	the	line	of	palms	along	the	shore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ocean	was	blue	and	sunny	through	the	trees.	‘I’m	saving.	I’ve	got	my	guitar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	get	a	ticket	and	a	few	bucks,	I’m	gone.’	Ray	had	been	driving	nearly	a year	and	had	heard	plenty	of	drivers’	dreams. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Hope	you	make	it,	man.	Send	me	a	card.’	A	woman	came	out	carrying	a	Liberty House	shopping	bag.	Jim	opened	the	door	for	her,	waved	at	Ray,	and	drove	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ray	moved	to	first	in	line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	weeks	later,	Jim	Pizza	wasn’t	around	any	more.	One	morning	in	February, Archer	said,	‘This	came	in	yesterday.’	He	handed	Ray	a	card’a	photograph	of	a sculpted	mermaid	in	a	harbor.	On	the	other	side,	next	to	the	address,	it	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Made	it!	Playing	every	day.	Come	on	over.	Your	friend,	Jim	Pizza.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Son	of	a	bitch,’	Ray	said.	‘He	did	it.	Jim	Pizza’he’s	in	Copenhagen	playing	his guitar.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘He’s	a	good	driver,’	Archer	said.	‘Shows	up	every	so	often	for	a	while	and	takes off.’	He	raised	his	eyebrows,	smiled,	and	spread	his	arms.	‘The	wild	years.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a>Ray	bought	a	paper	and	coffee	and	drove	to	the	Ala	Moana	Hotel.	It	was	usually a	long	wait,	but	sometimes	you	got	an	airport	load.	Not	much	else	going	on	at six. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	hotel	was	dead.	He	waited	fifteen	minutes,	last	in	line,	and	changed	his mind.	He	cruised	around	the	shopping	center	and	down	Ala	Moana	Boulevard.	A woman	waved	at	him	from	the	entrance	to	the	Ilikai	and	hurried	toward	the sidewalk.	Ray	didn’t	see	any	doormen	or	SIDA	cabs.	He	stopped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	got	in	and	half	collapsed,	half	threw	herself	into	the	back	seat,	letting	out	a long	breath.	Ray	pulled	away	quickly.	‘Where	to’	We’re	not	supposed	to	pick	up here.’	He	saw	her	looking	at	him	in	the	rear	view	mirror.	She	looked	upset,	as though	she	hadn’t	slept.	Shoulder	length	black	hair,	strong	face,	broad cheekbones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Take	me	where	I	can	hear	the	ocean.	I	need	to	just	sit	for	awhile.’	Ray	drove through	Kapiolani	Park	to	Diamond	Head	and	stopped	at	the	lookout.	They rolled	down	the	windows.	Surf	crashed	softly	below.	The	morning	was	still	gray but	beginning	to	brighten. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	sighed	and	was	quiet,	her	head	turned	to	look	out	at	the	Pacific.	The meter	ticked.	Ray	reached	over	and	shut	it	off.	He	adjusted	himself	to	have	a better	view.	Sadness	from	the	back	seat	filled	the	cab.	He	gave	in	to	it.	There	was plenty	to	be	sad	about.	Then	there	was	the	ocean	that	didn’t	care,	that	just	rolled along	the	shore,	ever	changing,	timeless.	The	light.	It	was	the	light	that	made	it bearable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sadness	began	to	dissipate	like	a	fine	mist	burning	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	can	go	back	now,’	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘O.K.’	He	straightened	and	reached	for	the	key.	He	needed	a	moment	before	he could	stand	the	sound	of	the	starter.	‘O.K,’	he	said	again.	They	didn’t	speak	until they	reached	the	Ilikai. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	want	to	come	up	for	a	joint?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Sure.	Of	course.	But	I’m	not	going	to.’	He	surprised	himself.	But	it	was	the right	thing	to	do’he	didn’t	know	why. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p70"></a>‘You’re	an	outlaw,’	she	said	slowly.	He	was	startled.	Their	eyes	met	and	held. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	truth,	or	the	truth	in	him,	seemed	to	satisfy	her,	to	set	rings	expanding	in	her eyes.	She	smiled	for	the	first	time’a	small	proud	possessive	smile.	‘Handsome outlaw.’	She	handed	him	a	twenty.	‘Is	this	enough?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	don’t	need?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘It	doesn’t	matter.’	She	let	herself	out.	Ray	opened	his	door	and	stood	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Aloha,’	he	said.	She	looked	at	him,	wide	open	for	a	moment,	then	her	mouth firmed	and	her	head	rose.	She	had	a	hard	place,	too.	She	raised	one	hand,	turned, and	walked	into	the	hotel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	drove	around	the	corner	to	Tops	for	breakfast.	What	was	that	all	about’	A couple	of	months	ago,	at	the	Hawaiian	Regent,	a	gal	with	a	blonde	pony	tail	and square	shoulders	asked	Tim	in	the	next	cab	if	he	would	help	with	her	luggage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tim	said	he	got	to	her	room	and	she	grabbed	him,	saying	she	didn’t	want	to leave	without	getting	laid.	He	asked	Tim	what	happened.	‘It	was	great.’	Ray	was envious.	Now	it	happens	to	him,	and	what	does	he	do’	Turns	her	down.	Good looking,	too.	Better	than	the	blonde. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	what’ten	years	older’	He	felt	drawn	to	her	past,	a	detour	from	his	future. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	an	outlaw	herself,	or	she	loved	one.	He	imagined	coming	close	enough to	touch	her	cheek	and	stopped	himself	before	he	ran	back	to	the	Ilikai. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	day	that	he	had	off,	he	slept	late	and	walked	to	the	Moana.	He	had	a beer	and	watched	the	wildlife’Japanese	women,	Germans,	Scandinavians, mainland	women,	pacing	up	and	down	the	beach,	some	shy,	some	looking	for company,	some	disinterested.	He	was	uneasy.	Women.	It	wasn’t	as	if	he	were stuck	in	the	woods	somewhere.	Waikiki	beach	for	Christ’s	sake,	in	the	middle	of winter,	no	less. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	walked	toward	the	Sheraton	and	stared	at	a	sharp	looking	blonde	lying	on	a white	towel.	Perfect	body.	She	noticed	him,	and	he	turned	aside,	sitting	on	a	low concrete	wall	by	a	concession	stand.	A	few	minutes	later,	she	stood	and	came slowly	toward	him.	The	line	waiting	for	service	ended	just	in	front	of	him.	She stopped	at	the	end	of	the	line,	stepped	sideways,	and	turned	so	that	the	front	of her	bikini	was	six	inches	from	his	face.	It	was:	you	want	to	look,	look.	Your move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	in	the	line	called	to	her	in	German.	They	had	a	cheerful	exchange.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>added,	in	English,	‘You	can	tell	by	the	accent.’	She	didn’t	move	her	lower	body an	inch.	He	could	see	every	tiny	blonde	hair	on	her	tanned	skin,	every	grain	of sand	along	the	edge	of	her	bikini,	the	compound	curves	and	the	subtle	swell	of her	belly.	He	could	lean	forward	and	kiss	her.	He	could	draw	back	and	look	up	at her,	let	her	laugh.	He	sat,	matching	her	stillness	with	his	while	her	beauty rearranged	his	brain.	She	would	not	move,	and	neither	would	he. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	last,	her	friends	called	her	away.	Someone	handed	her	a	soda.	She	left	as deliberately	as	she	had	come,	walking	back	to	her	towel.	Ray	stayed	still	for several	minutes.	When	he	was	able,	he	took	several	steps	in	her	direction, stopped,	and	bowed	his	head	respectfully.	A	challenge	had	become	an	exchange. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	seemed	to	have	everything,	and	he	felt	as	though	he	had	nothing.	But	on some	level	they	were	equal.	She	wiggled	comfortably	into	the	sand.	Ray	went back	to	the	Moana. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Gilbert,	you	married?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bartender	opened	a	beer	for	him.	‘Twenty-seven	years.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘It’s	a	good	thing,	huh?’	Gilbert	nodded,	wiping	the	bar.	‘You	got	kids?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Two.	Almost	as	old	as	you.	Better	looking,	though.’	Gilbert	went	over	to another	customer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ray	sat	at	his	favorite	table.	He	had	sketched	Diamond	Head	from	there	so	many times	that	it	was	part	of	his	mental	landscape.	The	slopes	were	deep	green	now, but	he	could	see	summer,	the	sagey	brown	beneath	the	green.	Hard	to	believe that	he’d	been	driving	more	than	a	year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Time	was	strange	in	a	taxi’each	day	was	long,	hour	after	hour,	waiting	mostly, but	the	weeks	and	months	went	by	nearly	unnoticed.	It	was	a	kind	of	coma, taxicoma.	Probably,	it	wasn’t	good.	He	wasn’t	making	much	money,	just	enough to	get	by,	but	he	always	had	cash	in	his	pocket;	he	could	stop	any	time	he	wanted for	coffee	and	an	English	muffin.	He	had	a	car.	His	shirt,	white	with	an	orange tapa	collar,	Charley’s	Taxi	embroidered	in	red	over	the	pocket,	labeled	him, made	him	anonymous.	People	saw	the	shirt,	not	him.	Perfect.	For	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	met	drivers	who	had	never	done	anything	else.	Most	of	them	owned	their own	cabs,	renting	them	to	other	drivers	on	days	or	nights	off.	Some	had	two	or three	cabs.	Archer	had	about	thirty,	had	made	a	real	business	of	it.	Archer	treated</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a>people	fairly	and	had	a	steady	flow	of	students,	loners,	artists,	and	people passing	through	who	needed	to	make	a	few	bucks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	moved	from	Bob’s	into	a	studio	on	Piikoi	Street,	not	far	away.	The monthly	rent	was	the	same	as	he	had	paid	Bob	by	the	week,	when	you	added	it up.	The	studio	was	more	private.	It	had	a	small	lanai	that	looked	toward	the mountain.	He	bought	an	hibachi	and	ate	most	of	his	meals	out	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But,	women’	He	couldn’t	get	anywhere.	He’d	even	paid	fifty	bucks	once.	Late one	night	in	a	bar	on	Pauahi	Street,	two	hookers	took	his	money	and	led	him	to	a sagging	four	door	Oldsmobile.	They	drove	him	away,	the	driver	working	with one	hand	to	open	his	pants	while	the	other	leaned	over	from	the	back	seat	and unbuttoned	his	shirt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘C’mon,	Baby,’	she	said	in	his	ear.	‘Let’s	get	it	on.	Let’s	you	and	me	have	a black-white	thing.	C’mon	back	here	with	me.’	The	driver	stopped,	and	the woman	in	back	opened	her	door.	‘C’mon,	Sugar.’	Ray	crawled	out,	pants	half down.	The	gal	in	the	back	seat	hopped	in	front;	the	car	took	off,	the	women howling	with	laughter,	slamming	doors,	leaning	out	the	open	windows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Bye,	bye,	Mother	Fucker!	Stupid	Mother	Fucker!	Believe	that	shit!!’	Ray	pulled up	his	pants	and	began	walking	back	to	Pauahi	Street,	laughing	too,	but	not	as hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	seemed	to	have	been	putting	out	a	stay	away	vibe.	And	now,	twice	in	one week,	women	had	shown	up	and	were	getting	in	close.	He	had	a	beer	for	the road	and	walked	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	days	later,	he	was	driving	through	Moiliili	about	nine	in	the	morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anybody	Manoa’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Two-nine,	University	and	Beretania.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Two-nine,	17	Aalii	Street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Two-nine,	17	Aalii.’	He	turned	up	University	and	pulled	over	at	the	top	of	the hill.	The	map	showed	Aalii,	well	into	the	valley	on	the	Ewa	side,	a	short	street, the	highest	one	before	the	ridge	became	too	steep	for	building.	When	he	got there,	a	woman	was	waiting	at	the	bottom	of	wooden	steps	that	disappeared	in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a>greenery.	Ray	waved	and	turned	the	cab	around.	He	got	out	to	help	with	her suitcase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No	need,’	she	said,	flipping	the	suitcase	into	the	trunk.	She	had	black	hair,	a long	squarish	face,	blue	eyes,	and	an	island	tan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Wooo,’	Ray	said,	raising	his	eyebrows	and	making	a	muscle	with	one	arm	as	he closed	the	trunk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘There’s	nothing	in	it,’	she	said.	‘You	mind	if	I	sit	up	front?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Nope.	Where	to?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Airport.’	Lucky	day.	‘But	first	I’ve	got	to	get	my	stuff.	260	Hobron,	just	off	Ala Moana.	It	won’t	take	five	minutes.	I’m	all	ready	to	go.	I	just	didn’t	have	a suitcase.’	She	was	cheerful	and	sad	at	the	same	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	think	I’ve	seen	you	somewhere,’	Ray	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Could	be.	You	ever	go	in	the	Chart	House?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘That’s	it!’	He	remembered	her	eyes,	now’level.	And	watching	her	walk.	She moved	easily.	‘I	saw	you	there,	once.	But	your	hair	was	pinned	up	or	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes	I	go	in	there,	Fridays,	if	I’m	not	driving.	Good	pupus.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	like	the	shrimp,’	she	said.	‘How	long	have	you	been	driving?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘A	year,	a	little	more.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Do	you	make	any	money?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	get	by.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘About	like	me,’	she	said.	‘But	I	love	it	here.	You	know,	like	they	say,	lucky	you live	Hawaii.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yeah,	it’s	great.	Different.	I	never	knew	I	was	a	haole.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Me	neither.	Irish-American	haole.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘My	grandfather’s	Irish,’	Ray	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a>‘Oh	yeah’	What’s	his	name?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Murphy.	He	died	a	couple	of	years	ago.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Oh,	I	hate	it	when	people	die.’	She	tossed	her	head.	Out	of	the	corner	of	his	eye, Ray	saw	her	hair	settle	back	on	her	shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	Ray,’	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Ray	Murphy?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Jackson.	Ray	Jackson.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	Cait.	Coytleen	Sive	Sullivan,	that’s	how	I’d	say	it	in	Ireland.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Cait’s	a	good	name.	Kiss	me,	Kate.	Cait	the	great.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	bet	you	can’t	spell	Sive.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘How	much?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Five	bucks.	No,	it	isn’t	fair.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘It’s	fair,’	Ray	said.	‘S-A-I-B-H.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Damn	you!	How	did	you	know	that?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Aunt	Sive.	My	grandfather’s	sister.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Wouldn’t	you	know	I’d	get	the	only	cab	driver	in	Honolulu	who	can	spell	my name.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	give	you	five	bucks	if	you	can	spell	Jackson.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No	way.	Probably	some	weird	spelling	with	an	e	or	something.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘J-A-C-K-S-O-N.	I	tried.’	He	braked	and	turned	on	Hobron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	pointed.	‘It’s	the	green	one.’	He	stopped	and	handed	her	the	suitcase.	She was	nearly	as	tall	as	he	was.	Long	legs. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a>When	she	returned,	he	opened	the	trunk	and	she	slid	the	suitcase	in	using	both hands.	She	had	changed	into	a	linen	jacket	and	had	put	on	makeup.	Her	face	was more	focused,	prettier.	‘Quick	work,’	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shrugged	and	sat	in	front	again.	‘Let’s	go.	United.’	She	seemed	sad.	Ray turned	on	Ala	Moana	and	they	were	silent	past	the	shopping	center,	curving	past downtown,	through	the	sharp	smell	of	pineapple	from	the	cannery,	and	nearly	to the	airport.	Tension	gathered	between	them.	Approaching	the	terminal,	Ray swerved	into	the	lane	by	the	lei	stands	and	turned	off	the	motor.	He	jumped	out and	returned	with	a	ginger	lei. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘For	the	trip.’	He	passed	it	to	her	through	the	window.	Cait	placed	it	on	her	lap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	got	behind	the	wheel,	she	put	it	around	her	neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Thank	you.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stopped	at	United,	got	out,	and	retrieved	the	suitcase.	She	paid	him.	‘I	still owe	you	five,’	she	remembered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Maybe	I’ll	come	collect	at	the	Chart	House.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘O.K.’	She	turned	away	and	then	turned	again.	‘I’ll	be	back	in	a	week.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Aloha,’	Ray	said.	She	looked	terrific	in	the	lei.	She	smiled	and	left.	He	felt light-headed	and	strong.	‘Yes,’	he	said	as	she	entered	the	terminal.	He	pumped one	fist.	‘Yes!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">He	headed	downtown	and	turned	on	the	radio.	Van	Morrison.	Louder.	Brown-eyed	Girl	‘	he	started	singing.	Cait’s	eyes	were	blue.	That	didn’t	matter;	it	was the	feeling.	Brown-eyed	Girl	‘</p>
<p class="calibre1">While	he	was	busy,	he	didn’t	think	about	her.	In	the	quiet	times,	she	was	often beside	him	in	the	front	seat.	It	was	good	and	bad.	He	felt	excited,	less	lonely,	but he	was	used	to	controlling	his	situation,	and	this	feeling	wasn’t	quite	like	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wasn’t	out	of	control,	but	he	wasn’t	in	control,	either.	He	tried	to	describe	this to	Dean	while	they	waited	in	Kapiolani	Park	for	the	Eastman	Kodak	show	to	get out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘It’s	love,’	Dean	explained.	‘I	fell	in	love	with	the	housekeeper	when	I	was fifteen.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>‘What	happened?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Things	got	all	fucked	up.’	There	was	an	edge	of	sadness	in	his	smile,	but	Ray didn’t	see	any	regret. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Would	you	do	it	again?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	did	it	again.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">He	got	to	the	Chart	House	around	four,	an	hour	early	for	pupus.	He	took	a	deep breath	to	calm	down	before	he	went	in.	Cait	was	standing	at	the	end	of	the	bar, putting	drinks	on	a	tray.	The	bar	was	half	full.	Neil	Young	was	playing	on	a decent	sound	system.	There	didn’t	seem	to	be	a	hostess.	He	sat	at	a	table	by	open shutters	and	flower	boxes	that	overlooked	clusters	of	masts.	The	place	was expensive	but	worth	it	once	in	awhile	if	you	figured	the	pupus	were	dinner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	soon	as	she	turned	around,	she	saw	him	and	came	over,	smiling.	Neither spoke	for	a	moment.	Amazing.	It	didn’t	seem	to	matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘How	was	your	trip?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘My	mom	is	sick.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Oh.	Bad?’	He	knew	it	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Leukemia.’	She	shrugged,	helpless.	‘You	want	something	to	drink?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Heineken.’	She	brought	the	beer	and	told	him	that	she	could	sit	for	a	minute.	He pulled	out	a	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	sorry	about	your	mom.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cait	looked	out	the	window.	‘It	happens.	Who	knows’	There’s	so	much	shit	in the	air	and	the	food.	Who	knows	how	it	starts?’	Four	or	five	guys	came	in	talking loudly.	‘Here	we	go,’	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Damn,’	Ray	said.	‘You	want	to	get	together	sometime’	Go	for	a	walk,	have coffee	or	something?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	at	him.	‘Yes.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a>‘I	eat	breakfast	at	Tops	a	lot.	That’s	close	to	you.	We	could	meet	there?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Tomorrow?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Tomorrow.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cait	pushed	back	her	chair.	‘Around	nine?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Nine	o’clock.	I’ll	be	there.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Beer’s	on	me,’	she	said.	‘Me	and	Aunt	Saibh.’	She	went	back	to	work.	Ray didn’t	want	to	watch	her	smile	for	the	customers.	He	drank	up,	thought	about leaving	a	note,	decided	against	it,	and	left.	Halfway	down	the	block	he	realized that	the	pupus	hadn’t	even	arrived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stopped	for	a	mahi	burger	at	Zippy’s.	Leukemia,	that	was	cancer,	right’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Heavy.	Where	was	she	from’	He	hadn’t	even	asked.	Sounded	like	the	midwest somewhere.	He’d	find	out	in	the	morning.	He	liked	her	hands’strong.	She	had	a silver	ring	on	one	finger.	Which	one’	He	took	out	his	notebook	and	sketched	her hands	and	wrists.	The	ring	was	on	the	middle	finger	of	her	left	hand.	Her	wrists were	wide	and	flat.	He	made	them	too	thick.	He	tried	again,	but	this	time	he	was too	careful;	the	hands	didn’t	have	any	life	in	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	morning,	he	picked	up	two-nine	at	Muni’s	and	bought	coffee	and	a malasada	to	hold	him	until	breakfast.	It	was	slow’one	load	downtown	and	then	a long	wait	at	Holiday	Mart.	Two	women	came	out	with	many	bags	of	groceries; they	were	probably	shopping	for	the	month.	The	older	one,	perhaps	seventy,	said nothing.	The	younger,	in	her	forties,	gave	an	address	in	Manoa.	She	directed	him down	a	small	street	that	led	into	a	lane	that	ended	at	a	weathered	house	standing by	itself	on	a	small	knoll.	The	house	was	dark	and	quiet.	Ray	carried	bags	to	the lanai	in	silence.	A	line	of	zoris	neatly	aligned	next	to	the	door	seemed untouched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	five	minutes	late	to	Tops	and	apologized	to	Cait	who	was	sitting	in	a booth	by	a	window.	‘I	had	to	carry	a	lot	of	groceries’way	up	in	Manoa.’	He shook	his	shoulders,	remembering.	‘Strange	place.	How	are	you?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Good.	Starving.	What	was	strange?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">He	described	the	women	and	the	house,	the	silent	lanai.	‘It	was	like	a	hundred</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a>years	ago.	No	lights.	Completely	plain.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Do	you	think	it	was	just	the	two	women	living	there?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Seemed	that	way.	It	was	like	life	had	left	them	stranded	there.	Something	about the	house.	They	were	like	museum	keepers.	But	they	were	part	of	the	museum.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘It	sounds	beautiful,	in	a	way.	A	little	scary.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">They	ordered	a	big	breakfast.	Ray	told	her	he’d	grown	up	in	Maine,	played baseball	and	football,	and	dropped	out	of	the	University	his	sophomore	year.	‘I could	have	started,	but’I	don’t	know’it	wasn’t	any	fun.	You	were	supposed	to	do everything	a	certain	way.	The	catching	coach	wasn’t	that	great,	really.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	were	a	catcher?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yep.	We	almost	won	the	states	in	high	school.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘My	dad’s	a	coach.	I	used	to	play	a	lot.	Pitched	softball.	We	had	a	pretty	good team.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘All	we	need	is	a	shortstop,’	Ray	said.	‘Build	on	that.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘A	coed	league,’	she	said.	‘That	would	be	cool.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	checked	out	a	league	here,’	Ray	said.	‘They	were	having	a	good	time,	seemed like	pretty	good	guys.	I	was	ahead	of	them,	though.	I	didn’t	want	to	show anybody	up,	be	the	hot	shot,	you	know.	It	was	better	to	let	it	be.’	She	seemed	to understand.	‘Did	you	go	to	school?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘University	of	Wisconsin.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Did	you	graduate?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Barely.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What	did	you	major	in?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Art’sculpture.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No	shit!’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a>‘Yeah,	I	love	making	stuff.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Do	you	just	make	what	you	feel	like	making,	or	do	you	copy	stuff’	You	know, Michelangelo.	Greek	stuff.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	not	good	enough	to	copy	Michelangelo.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	know	what	you	mean.	I’m	not	good	enough	to	copy	Rembrandt.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cait	started	laughing.	‘What?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	got	a	Rembrandt	book	in	the	bookstore.	Because	of	the	self	portrait.	I	don’t believe	that	painting!	I	tried	to	draw	one	myself,	but	I	kept	screwing	it	up’not even	close.’	She	was	looking	at	him	differently,	not	laughing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘It’s	hard,’	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What,	drawing?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Anything’if	you’re	going	to	do	it	right.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ray	drew	back	and	searched	around	for	their	waitress.	‘Need	more	coffee,’	he said.	Cait	pushed	a	heap	of	rice	from	one	side	of	her	plate	to	the	other,	made	a terrace	with	her	fork	on	one	side,	while	she	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	had	somebody	in	the	cab	last	week.	We	got	talking.	She	called	me	an	outlaw.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stopped	while	the	waitress	filled	their	cups.	The	hard	place	tightened	his cheeks,	put	a	band	across	his	mouth.	But	another	feeling	broke	through	like	lava. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘She	was	right.’	Cait	waited.	‘I	am.	I’m	wanted	for	resisting	arrest	and smuggling	dope.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Grass?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yeah.	Probably	some	other	charges,	too.	I	don’t	know;	I	didn’t	stick	around	to find	out.	You’re	the	first	person	I’ve	told.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Jesus,’	Cait	said,	‘I	find	a	decent	guy	and	he’s	a	drug	dealer.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	not,’	Ray	said.	‘I	just	made	a	couple	of	deliveries	for	a	guy.	Anyway,	I’ve stopped.	It	was	stupid.’	Cait	was	shaking	her	head.	‘It	doesn’t	matter,’	Ray	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>‘except	that	I	can’t	go	back.	Maybe	I	should	have	let	myself	get	arrested,	gone	to jail,	gotten	it	over	with.	I	don’t	know.	I	couldn’t.	I	took	off.	Lucky	I	didn’t	get shot.	My	dog	got	shot.	Damn.’	He	swallowed.	‘He	was	a	good	dog.	I	hate	to remember	it.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cait	spoke	slowly.	‘How	are	you	going	to	keep	from	getting	caught?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Look,’	Ray	pushed	his	chair	back.	‘You	don’t	want	to	know	any	of	this.	I shouldn’t	have	said	anything.	Just	forget	it.	I’m	sorry.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cait	sat	still,	shook	her	head	once.	‘Too	late,’	she	said.	‘I	knew	it.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Knew	what?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘That	you	were	big	trouble.	Let’s’let’s	take	a	walk,	or	something.	Let’s	get	out	of here.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ray	hesitated.	It	was	so	good	to	be	straight	with	her.	‘Yeah,	O.K.	My	cab’s around	back,’	he	remembered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	don’t	have	to	work	until	noon,’	Cait	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	drove	to	Kapiolani	Park	and	walked	along	the	sidewalk	in	the	shade	of	the tall	pines.	He	told	her	how	he’d	gotten	his	new	identity.	‘I’m	all	right	as	long	as no	one	knows	at	home	and	as	long	as	I	don’t	get	arrested	and	get	fingerprinted.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You’ve	been	careful.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Well,	it’s	serious.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘It	must	be	hard	not	to	be	able	to	go	home	or	be	in	touch.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘It	hasn’t	been	too	bad.	I	miss	my	mom	and	my	sister,	Molly,	the	most.	My	mom remarried	when	I	was	a	senior	in	high	school’a	guy	named	Ron,	a	decent	guy.	He has	three	kids	from	another	marriage.’	He	kicked	a	pebble	off	the	sidewalk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Maybe	it	will	blow	over	after	a	while.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ve	got	some	things	to	tell	you.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Oh,	oh.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>‘I’ve	done	some	bad	things,	too.’	She	touched	his	arm	for	a	moment.	‘I	took	my sister’s	boyfriend.	I	made	him	fall	for	me’just	to	show	her	I	could.’	It	was	Ray’s turn	to	wait. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘That	was	bad	enough.	But	he	really	fell	for	me.’	Her	voice	constricted.	‘I	had	to tell	him	that	it	wasn’t	going	to	work.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Too	bad,’	Ray	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘He	shot	himself.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Whoooa.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘So,	I	killed	him.	That’s	worse	than	what	you	did.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	didn’t	kill	him.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	might	as	well	have.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ray	saw	a	hard	light	in	her	face.	Rugged.	He	didn’t	know	what	to	say;	it	didn’t seem	like	a	great	time	to	say	anything.	They	passed	two	guys	playing	congas, one	bare	chested,	one	wearing	an	orange	T-shirt	with	a	blazing	sun	on	the	front. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sound	floated	to	sea	with	the	clouds	and	the	tradewind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘That	was	four	years	ago.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Shit,’	Ray	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘My	sister	still	hates	me.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">They	walked	farther.	Ray	said,	‘He	didn’t	have	to	leave	her.	He	didn’t	have	to kill	himself.’	He	paused.	‘I	wouldn’t	kill	myself.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cait	took	his	hand.	‘Let’s	go	back.	Let’s	go	to	my	place.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ray	drove	along	the	one	way	street,	around	the	park,	and	up	Ala	Wai	Boulevard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	rented	my	parking	space,’	she	said.	‘Maybe	we	can	find	one	close.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘We	can	leave	it	at	Tops	if	we	have	to,’	Ray	said.	They	were	lucky	and	found	a spot	close	to	her	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a>She	led	him	up	a	staircase	to	the	fourth	floor.	‘I	don’t	use	the	elevator	unless	I’ve got	a	lot	of	stuff.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	apartment	was	sunny’one	large	room	with	a	kitchenette	at	the	end,	a	lanai,	a bedroom.	A	table	was	partially	covered	with	tools	and	several	small	figures made	of	clay.	A	large	birdlike	object	stood	on	the	floor	by	the	window.	It	was brightly	painted.	‘Wow!	Is	that	wood?’	He	pointed	at	the	bird. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Laminated,’	she	said.	‘Be	right	back.’	She	went	into	the	bedroom.	He	moved closer	to	the	table	and	looked	at	fingermarks	in	the	clay	figures.	A	toilet	flushed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Ray?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cait	was	standing	in	the	bedroom	doorway	wearing	only	a	T-shirt	and	panties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	raised	her	eyebrows	and	held	out	her	arms.	He	went	to	her	and	put	his	hands on	her	shoulders.	She	stepped	against	him.	His	hands	moved	to	her	back,	and they	stood	together,	rocking	slightly.	She	drew	him	back	and	onto	her	bed	where they	lay	facing	each	other.	She	made	tracings	on	his	chest	with	one	finger.	He was	tense,	tight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	think	I’ll	take	my	shoes	off.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What	a	great	idea!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">He	lay	back	down.	She	rolled	him	away	from	her	and	rubbed	his	back,	moving his	muscles	around	with	circular	motions.	He	began	to	relax.	One	of	her	hands reached	down	along	his	hip.	A	short	sound	escaped	from	his	chest.	A	longer sound	followed	and	turned	him	over	toward	her.	He	buried	his	face	against	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	couldn’t	stop,	a	sound	of	want	and	need.	His	hands	went	around	her	ass.	She nibbled	on	his	face,	lips	soft,	mouth	half	open.	She	tugged	at	his	shirt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	pushed	his	pants	off	and	slowly	pulled	her	panties	down	from	her	hips	and along	her	legs.	She	put	her	hands	under	his	arms	and	pulled	him	up	over	her, opening	her	legs	for	him	as	she	lay	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	no	rush	or	hurry.	She	guided	him	into	her	as	though	they	did	this every	day.	As	he	held	her,	the	force	with	which	she	pressed	against	him	was equal	to	his	but	different.	He	gave	in	to	her,	to	the	doubleness	that	drew	them both	to	slow	waves	of	pleasure,	finally	lifting	and	crashing,	rolling	them	up	on	a beach.	He	fell	asleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a>When	he	opened	his	eyes,	he	saw	her	lying	next	to	him	with	a	sweet	half	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You’re	going	to	be	late,’	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘They’re	going	to	have	to	get	used	to	it.’	Her	eyes	opened	wider,	and	she	said,	‘I need	to	know	your	real	name.	You’ll	always	be	Ray	to	me,	but	I	need	to	know.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Charlie	Walker.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">A	weight	lifted	from	him	when	he	said	it.	He	looked	away	and	then	back.	She was	crying.	‘It’s	O.K.,’	she	said.	‘Ray.’	He	held	her	close.	Their	bodies	were warm	and	wet	with	each	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Ray	loves	Cait,’	he	said	and	held	her	tighter.	She	rolled	her	face	across	his shoulder,	drying	her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Ray	better	not	forget	it,’	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a><b class="calibre3">14</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Four	months	after	the	wedding,	Lynn	announced	that	she	was	pregnant.	Harry had	made	a	low	offer	on	a	good	property	in	the	Foreside.	He	raised	it	forty thousand,	and	it	was	accepted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Time	passed	quickly	as	they	set	up	house.	Lynn	had	a	boy,	Fergus,	who	was healthy	and	seemed	to	take	mostly	after	her.	She	was	glad	to	be	done	with college	and	enjoyed	being	a	full	time	mother,	shopping,	decorating	the	house, and	listening	to	Harry’s	stories	about	the	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	worked	hard.	At	home,	he	watched	sports	on	TV	and	occasionally	looked after	Fergus,	giving	Lynn	a	break.	He	started	his	first	big	money	project’a condominium	development	on	a	wharf	in	the	Old	Port. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	day	that	he	paid	for	an	option	on	the	wharf,	he	stayed	up	late	watching	a game,	eating	leftover	pizza,	and	drinking	beer.	Lynn	was	sound	asleep	when	he got	to	bed.	He	lay	down	next	to	her,	and	for	a	few	moments,	before	he	closed	his eyes,	he	felt	uneasy.	He	didn’t	have	any	problems	that	he	knew	of.	Things	were happening	the	way	they	were	supposed	to.	Too	much	pizza. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fergus	howled	at	first	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Jesus,’	Harry	said	without	opening	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Mommy’s	coming,	Sweetie.	Here	I	am.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What	is	he,	thirty	inches’	Should	have	named	him	Air	Raid.’	He	listened	to Lynn	comforting	the	baby	and	fell	asleep	in	the	blissful	quiet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	woke	up,	Lynn	was	downstairs	moving	around	in	the	kitchen.	He smelled	coffee	and	heard	Robert	J.	Lertsema,	the	NPR	announcer.	They	had considered	buying	a	ranch	house	on	the	water	in	Cape	Elizabeth,	but	Harry wanted	to	go	upstairs	to	bed.	He	liked	sleeping	above	the	fray,	as	his	father would	say.	He	hadn’t	figured	that	the	fray	was	portable	and	would	lie	in	a	crib	in the	next	room.	He	and	Lynn	were	fine	in	the	old	farmhouse.	They	liked	the	field and	woodlot’extra	land	to	sell	if	they	wanted	to	someday.	He’d	paid	a	reasonable price	for	the	location,	a	mile	from	the	coast,	got	the	house	for	nothing,	really; </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a>they	were	paying	for	the	land. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	put	on	his	bathrobe	and	descended	to	the	kitchen.	‘Mornin’,	Mother,’	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Look	at	them	cabinets!’	The	kitchen	remodeling	was	finally	done.	‘Morning, Air	Raid.’	Fergus	ignored	him,	eyes	fixed	on	a	blue	plastic	cup.	It	made	a	great racket	when	Fergus	slammed	it	on	the	tray. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lynn	set	a	mug	of	coffee	on	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Thanks,	Hon.	How	about	a	hug?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">She	came	close,	and	they	held	each	other.	Fergus	crashed	the	cup	and	let	out	a preliminary	cry,	winding	up.	Lynn	rushed	over	and	kissed	him	as	she	picked	the cup	off	the	floor	and	put	it	back	on	the	tray.	‘There,’	she	said.	‘There’s	my	little baby.	Everything’s	all	right.’	She	turned	toward	Harry.	‘What’s	happening today?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Meeting	with	Larsen	about	the	project.	Can’t	do	anything	in	this	town	without his	say	so,	now	that	he’s	on	the	council.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘He’s	been	O.K.	as	police	chief,’	she	said.	‘He	didn’t	lock	you	up.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘True.	And	he	got	a	lot	of	votes	out	of	the	Larsen	Youth	Center.’	Fergus	threw the	cup	to	the	floor.	‘Right,	Son,’	Harry	said,	‘that’s	how	I	feel	about	him.’	He replaced	the	cup	on	the	tray.	‘Have	a	drink.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘He’s	learning,	little	sweetie,’	Lynn	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	going	to	get	going,’	Harry	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	took	a	shower	and	drove	to	Portland.	The	air	was	cold	and	dull.	It	had	been	a colorful	fall,	but	most	of	the	leaves	were	down.	Deer	season	was	just	around	the corner’maniacs	from	Boston	wearing	blaze	orange,	trampling	around,	manfully unshaven,	hungover,	firing	at	dogs,	cows,	sometimes	even	deer.	Stay	out	of	the woods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stopped	at	Mr.	Bagel	and	looked	through	the	paper.	Not	much	happening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	city	would	be	glad	for	the	construction	of	his	building	when	he	got	all	the permits.	He	bought	a	bagel	with	lox	for	Mort	and	parked	in	the	garage	on	Union Street. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a>‘Soul	food,’	he	said,	putting	the	bag	on	Mort’s	desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mort	unwrapped	the	bagel.	‘Ah’there’s	food	and	there’s	food.’	He	chewed	with pleasure.	‘You	know,	Harry,	if	you	were	a	little	smarter,	you’d	make	a	good Jew.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	working	on	it,’	Harry	said.	‘How	smart	is	our	bank	account’	Can	I	write	a check	for	five	hundred	thousand?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Sure.	You’d	have	enough	left	to	buy	me	another	bagel.	That	architect	cost	a bundle.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘O’Malley.	His	wife	is	on	the	council.	Eileen.	I	think	she’s	screwing	Tony Caravalho,	but	I’m	not	sure.	Anyway,	she’s	on	our	side	now.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘So,	if	you	get	Larsen?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Right.	Larsen,	Eileen	O’Malley,	Tony,	we’re	almost	there.	Three	of	the	others usually	vote	with	them.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What	do	we	need,	eight?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yep.	The	Save	the	Harbor	people	have	four	votes.	Larsen	is	key.	He	needs	to	be on	the	winning	side	all	the	time,	the	man	who	gets	things	done.	He’ll	be	running for	Congress	as	soon	as	he	can.’	Harry	shrugged.	‘The	condo	design	is	O.K. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shouldn’t	piss	off	too	many	people.	O’Malley’s	been	doing	this	for	awhile;	he must	have	learned	something.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Where	are	you	going	to	get	the	building	dough?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Not	sure	yet.	I’ll	have	more	leverage	when	I	get	the	permit.	I’ve	got	twelve more	months	on	the	wharf	option.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What’s	it	going	to	take,	five	mil?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Six,	anyway.	Maybe	eight.	Depends	on	how	it	goes.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Interest	rates	are	crazy,’	Mort	said.	‘You	should	be	lending,	not	borrowing.	It’s bond	time,	Baby.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>‘Maybe	next	year.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	went	out	for	a	haircut	and	arrived	at	T’s	Oyster	Bar	a	few	minutes	early.	A short	blonde	waitress	greeted	him	with	a	smile.	She	dropped	a	pen	and	bent	over to	retrieve	it.	She	had	an	eager	body	that	welcomed	the	world,	especially	the young	male	world.	‘Carramba,’	Harry	said,	looking	at	her	breasts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘We	don’t	have	any	of	those.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	think,’	Harry	lifted	his	eyes,	‘I	need	one	of	your	famous	bloody	Marys.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Coming	up.’	She	wrote	on	her	order	pad.	In	an	earlier	time,	she	might	have moistened	her	pencil	with	her	tongue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘There’ll	be	two	of	us.	Chief	Larsen.	You	sure	you’re	twenty-one?’	Her	cheeks reddened.	‘I’m	sorry,’	Harry	said.	‘Sometimes	I’m	such	an	asshole.	What’s	your name?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Angel.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Perfect.	I’m	sorry,	Angel.	I’m	Harry.	I’m	going	to	have	some	steamers,	but	I’ll wait	to	order.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	get	your	drink.’	Outside	the	window,	the	slips	that	once	held	lobster	boats were	filled	with	double	and	triple	decked	power	boats.	A	wooden	schooner, partially	restored,	was	the	last	holdout	against	plastic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Angel	set	his	drink	in	front	of	him.	He	stirred	it	with	the	green	celery	stalk, smelled	the	tomatoes	and	horseradish,	lifted	the	glass	in	her	direction,	and swallowed.	The	vodka	slid	down	his	throat	and	warmed	him.	‘We	have	ignition,’</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	said,	staring	again.	Her	body	was	solid	and	fluid	at	the	same	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Maddy	makes	them	good.	Some	people	don’t	like	so	much	horseradish.’	The expression	around	her	eyes	was	experienced,	cynical	almost,	but	the	eyes themselves	were	an	innocent	almond	color. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Hello,	Harry.’	Larsen	loomed	over	Angel,	rested	a	heavy	hand	on	Harry’s shoulder,	and	patted	him	twice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Hello,	Chief.	This	is	Angel.	Angel,	Chief	Larsen.’	Larsen	extended	his	hand	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a>Angel	shook	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Pleased	to	meet	you,	Chief,’	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Tom.	Call	me	Tom.	Never	mind	the	Chief.	What’cha	got	there,	Harry?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Bloody	Mary.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Looks	damn	good.	I’ll	have	an	iced	tea,	Angel.	Gotta	walk	the	walk.’	Angel wrote	on	her	pad	and	Larsen	sat	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Well,	Harry,	what’s	new?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Not	too	much.	Coming	along	on	some	projects.	The	big	one’s	on	your	desk.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Larsen	looked	around	and	lowered	his	voice.	‘You’ve	got	some	opposition, there.	Some	folks	see	it	as:	Harry	George	wins,	the	waterfront	loses.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘People	don’t	like	change,’	Harry	said,	‘but	it’s	coming	anyway.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Bound	to,’	Larsen	said	mildly.	‘Thanks	Angel.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘It’s	good	for	the	city,’	Harry	said.	‘Besides,	if	I	don’t	do	it,	somebody	else	will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Might	as	well	have	a	project	that	looks	good.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Larsen	drank	his	iced	tea.	He	was	wearing	an	expensive	shirt.	‘I	don’t	see anything	wrong	with	the	plans,’	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Can’t	go	wrong	with	Keenan	O’Malley,’	Harry	said.	‘Nice	shirt,	by	the	way.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	chief’s	eyes	glittered	momentarily.	The	shirt	was	intended	to	impress people,	to	shut	them	up,	not	to	be	pronounced	upon	by	squirts	like	Harry.	Harry set	the	hook.	‘What	do	I	have	to	do	to	get	the	votes?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Larsen	smiled	involuntarily.	‘Well,’	he	said,	thinking,	‘you’re	probably right’somebody’s	going	to	build	on	the	waterfront.	But	you	know,	Harry,	the council	wants	to	feel	they’re	doing	the	right	thing,	that	the	project	is	going	to someone	who	cares	about	the	community,	a	Portland	person.’	Harry	leaned forward	and	tried	to	look	like	a	Portland	person.	‘The	Foundation,	for	instance, The	Youth	Center’don’t	think	those	grants	aren’t	appreciated.’	Angel	approached and	they	ordered	steamers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a>‘You’ve	done	well	since	the	arrest.	Just	off	parole,	aren’t	you?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Two	months,’	Harry	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Good,	good.’	Larsen	wiped	his	mouth.	‘You’re	a	do-er,	Harry.	I	like	that.’	He was	the	judge,	now.	‘You	know,	I’ve	got	a	reputation	in	this	town	for	getting things	done.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yes.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Being	an	effective	Chief	of	Police’I	should	say,	becoming	an	effective	Chief	of Police’has	taught	me	a	lot.’	This	is	painful,	Harry	thought.	He	leaned	closer.	‘A community	is	built	on	trust.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No	pain,	no	gain.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	words	had	flown	out.	‘I	mean,’	Harry	said,	‘your	experience’it	couldn’t	have come	easy.	Must	have	been	some	hard	spots.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Better	believe	it,’	Larsen	said.	Angel	brought	the	steamers.	Harry	wished	she’d been	hanging	around.	Maybe	they	could	have	laughed	about	it	afterward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Anyway,	as	I	was	saying,	a	police	department,	in	particular,	is	one	of	those things	a	community	trusts.	They	trust	that	when	someone	breaks	the	law,	they’re going	to	get	caught.	We’ve	missed	a	few	little	guys,	but	we’ve	gotten	every	high profile	we’ve	gone	after’except	Charles	Walker.’	Larsen	shook	his	head	and rattled	around	in	his	bucket	of	steamers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘He	disappeared	completely,’	Harry	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Pisses	me	off,’	Larsen	said	through	a	mouthful	of	clam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	haven’t	heard	anything,’	Harry	said.	There	was	a	spot	of	butter	on	Larsen’s shirt.	Harry	looked	for	Angel	and	beckoned	her	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Could	I	have	a	glass	of	Chardonnay?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘We	can	do	that.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>‘I’ve	got	a	good	man	on	it,	Roland	Saucier,	but	he’s	come	up	empty.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	know	Roland,’	Harry	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You’re	a	smart	guy,	Harry.	You	may	not	know	where	Walker	is,	but	I’ll	bet	you could	find	him	if	you	really	wanted	to.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘If	I	really	wanted	to’like	I	really	want	this	permit?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Larsen	did	a	quid	pro	quo	with	his	eyebrows.	‘The	community,	Harry.	The community	takes	care	of	its	own.	Remember	that.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Got	it,’	Harry	said.	‘But	I	don’t	know	if	I	can	find	Charley.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	going	to	table	this	application	for	a	couple	of	months,’	Larsen	said.	‘See how	things	develop.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	want	me	to	report	to	you?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘That	won’t	be	necessary.	Any	leads	you	get,	pass	them	on	to	Roland.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘O.K.	You	know’if	I	do	find	Charley,	there’s	no	telling	what	he’d	say	to	make himself	look	better.	Might	not	do	me	much	good	with	the	council.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘If	he	turns	himself	in	and	pleads	guilty,	takes	a	deal,	he	wouldn’t	have	to	say anything.	I	think	we	could	arrange	a	light	sentence	in	that	case.	Say,	eighteen	to twenty	months.	With	time	off	for	good	behavior,	he’d	do	fifteen	or	sixteen months,	something	like	that.	He’d	make	a	public	apology,	agree	to	pay	a fine’maybe	about	the	same	as	yours.’	Larsen	stopped	for	a	clam.	‘What	did	you pay,	ten	grand?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Ten	grand.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yeah,	ten	grand,	then.	Maybe	fifteen.	He	could	say	that	he	knew	he	was	wrong and	that	we,	the	police	department,	were	going	to	get	him	sooner	or	later.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Nice	touch,’	Harry	said.	‘I’ll	see	what	I	can	do.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">They	finished	lunch.	Harry	tried	to	get	information	about	the	other	council members,	but	Larsen	wouldn’t	give.	They	talked	boats	for	a	few	minutes, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a>strolled	outside,	and	parted	with	smiles,	men	of	the	world.	Harry	went	back inside	and	left	an	extra	tip.	Angel	must	have	been	in	the	kitchen;	he	didn’t	see her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	walked	to	the	Eastern	Prom	and	stood	for	a	few	minutes	where	he	and	Lynn used	to	park	and	enjoy	the	view.	Aside	from	Brooklyn	Harbor,	Casco	Bay	was the	best	deep	water	anchorage	on	the	east	coast	and	the	closest	to	Europe.	In sailing	days,	when	distance	mattered	more,	it	was	a	bustling	port,.	Now,	except for	tankers	offloading	to	the	Montreal	pipeline	and	an	occasional	scrap	metal	or container	ship,	the	harbor	belonged	to	the	ferries	and	pleasure	boats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During	World	War	II,	the	yard	in	South	Portland	launched	a	Victory	Ship	every five	days.	Amazing.	They	weren’t	small	either’four	hundred	some	feet,	carried	a lot	of	cargo.	All	gone,	except	for	a	few	museum	ships.	Nothing	left	of	the industry.	Fishing	had	declined	steadily,	especially	since	the	factory	ships	started sucking	up	everything.	A	few	lobster	boats	and	long	liners	hung	on’old	timers who	owned	their	boats	and	houses,	a	few	kids	who	wanted	to	be	like	Dad	or Grandpa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Charley	was	like	that,	he	thought,	a	throwback	to	times	that	no	longer	existed	or mattered.	His	father,	if	Harry	remembered	right,	was	a	trapper	or	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Charley	was	probably	in	a	cabin	up	the	Yukon	or	some	other	god	forsaken	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still,	there	had	to	be	some	way	to	find	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later	that	night,	he	talked	it	over	with	Lynn.	She	thought	that	Charley’s	mother must	know	something.	Surely,	she	would	want	to	know	if	there	was	a	possible deal	that	would	get	Charley	a	lighter	sentence.	You	don’t	have	to	tell	her	about the	project,	Lynn	suggested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	comfortable	lying	next	to	her	in	their	bed,	in	their	house,	Fergus	asleep, dishes	washed,	things	in	their	place.	Since	Fergus	was	born,	he	hadn’t	wanted	to take	Lynn’s	clothes	off	the	way	he	used	to,	but	their	sex	life	was	pleasant enough.	Angel	rose	before	him	like	a	sweet	burglar.	Eyes	and	mouth.	What’s your	last	name’	She	smiled	and	disappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lynn	asked	him	where	Charley	used	to	hang	out.	Harry	could	ask	around.	There must	be	some	rumors.	Well-liked	people	didn’t	just	vanish.	She	was	right.	She was	right	about	a	lot	of	things.	Good	old	Lynn.	He	fell	asleep	and	didn’t	hear	her get	up	for	Fergus. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a>Later	that	week,	he	followed	Lynn’s	advice	and	talked	to	Charley’s	mother.	She was	suspicious,	but	she	listened.	She	might	or	might	not	have	accepted	his reason	for	wanting	to	find	Charley’that	he	wanted	to	close	the	matter,	get	it behind	him,	get	Charley	off	as	lightly	as	possible.	Just	between	us,	he	told	her,	if there’s	a	fine	involved,	Charley	won’t	have	to	worry	about	it.	Her	eyes	narrowed at	that.	She	didn’t	say	that	she’d	tell	Charley;	she	said	that	she	didn’t	know where	he	was.	She	was	telling	the	truth,	he	thought,	but	she	knew	he	was somewhere.	She	was	angry	and	hurt,	but	she	wasn’t	bereaved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	a	few	drinks	in	the	two	local	bars	near	Charley’s	high	school.	When	he asked	about	Charley,	people	looked	at	him	and	looked	away.	They	didn’t	have anything	to	say.	The	only	response	he	got	was	from	a	middle	aged	woman drinking	up	some	divorce	money,	a	redhead	with	chubby	cheeks	and	a	small mouth.	Kids	are	what	it’s	all	about,	she	told	Harry.	The	hell	with	the	rest	of	it.	A couple	of	drinks	later,	when	Harry	got	around	to	Charley,	she	leaned	toward	him and	said,	‘He’s	a	cute	one,	Charley	Walker.	I	wish	he	was	around	right	now.	You know	about	the	trouble	he	got	into’you	a	friend	of	his?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yeah,	in	the	old	days.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Well,	they	say	he	sends	his	mom	roses	every	year,	on	her	birthday.’	She	drank more.	‘I’ve	got	two	boys,’	she	said.	‘That’s	nice,	you	know	what	I	mean.	They say	he	sends	one	more	rose	every	year,	one	more	for	another	year	he	couldn’t	see her.	It’s	so	sad.	Charley	Walker	never	did	anyone	no	harm.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Buy	you	another	one?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">She	accepted	and	Harry	excused	himself	after	the	second	time	she	told	him	that nobody	knew	where	Charley	was	and	how	sad	things	could	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	air	outside	the	tavern	was	refreshingly	cold.	There	were	times	when	Harry liked	to	drink	and	times	that	he	didn’t.	This	was	one	of	the	latter.	He	had	a	bit	of a	buzz	on	and	a	sour	taste	in	his	mouth.	On	impulse,	he	stopped	in	to	see	his mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	coffee	with	her	in	the	library	while	she	sipped	sherry.	She	seemed	older, attractive	still,	but	thinner	at	the	temples.	Fergus	and	Lynn	were	well,	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	made	a	dinner	date.	She	told	him	that	his	father	had	had	a	financial	reversal but	was	hoping	that	things	might	go	his	way	at	the	end.	She	didn’t	seem	worried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	course,	her	money	was	unassailable.	He	talked	about	the	prospects	for	his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a>project	and	went	home	reassured.	His	world	had	slipped	out	of	focus	in	the tavern.	Sadness.	He	didn’t	have	time	for	it.	Life	was	tough.	That	was	all	there was	to	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	a	sunny	morning	with	clouds	off	to	the	southwest.	Winter	was	a	month away.	A	good	time	for	a	drive.	He	had	a	meeting	in	Albany	at	five	with	a	guy named	Sal,	a	cousin	of	Marty’s,	who	might	be	interested	in	the	project.	He needed	two	million,	he	figured,	to	get	started.	Marty	was	in	for	half	a	million	if the	permits	came	through.	The	bank	would	kick	in	the	rest,	once	it	was	a	sure thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	decided	to	take	Route	9	instead	of	the	Massachusetts	Turnpike.	He	could	stop for	lunch	at	the	Royal	Chelsea	Diner	in	West	Brattleboro.	Traffic	was	light.	The trees	were	bare,	the	woods	brown	and	gray’aside	from	evergreens,	color	was gone	for	the	year.	If	you	wanted	color	you	had	to	wear	it	or	go	south. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	the	time	Harry	had	crossed	the	Connecticut	River	into	Vermont,	he	had figured	out	his	best	offer	for	Sal.	It	was	good	to	have	that	fixed	in	your	mind before	you	started	dealing.	Along	with	the	standard	interest,	return	of	principal, and	percentage	of	profit	when	all	the	condos	were	sold,	a	luxury	unit	at	cost	with no	payment	due	for	five	to	ten	years	should	do	it.	Start	with	five	years,	go	up	to ten	if	necessary.	Full	payment	if	Sal	flipped	the	unit,	of	course.	He	could	give	on the	condo	fee	if	he	had	to,	try	to	get	half,	anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	drove	through	Brattleboro	and	stopped	in	the	diner	parking	lot.	He	got	out	of the	car	and	stretched.	Big	white	clouds	were	boiling	over	the	mountain,	but	it was	sunny	in	the	valley,	just	above	freezing.	He	went	inside	and	had	a	raspberry waffle,	bacon,	and	coffee	while	he	watched	mountain	people,	dairy	farmers, students,	and	New	York	intellectuals	come	and	go.	He	bought	a	coffee	mug	for home	on	the	way	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	the	time	Harry	got	to	Marlboro,	a	third	of	the	way	up	the	mountain,	the	sky had	clouded	over	and	flakes	were	falling.	Cars	coming	down	had	snow	on	their windshields	and	their	lights	were	on.	He	switched	on	the	wipers.	As	he	climbed, the	weather	worsened.	He	was	down	to	fifteen	miles	an	hour	in	a	howling	white-out	when	he	came	over	the	top	and	onto	the	high	plateau.	Six	inches	of	wet snow.	Cars	sliding	back	and	forth	in	front	of	him.	A	tractor-trailer	angled	over	in a	deep	ditch. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a>It	was	hard	to	believe	that	it	had	been	sunny	when	he	went	in	to	lunch,	an	hour ago,	not	twenty	miles	away.	He	hadn’t	seen	snow	since	the	winter	before;	he’d forgotten	how	completely	it	covers	a	landscape.	He	was	down	to	ten	miles	an hour,	leaning	forward,	trying	to	see	through	the	hurtling	flakes.	Occasionally	it let	up	enough	so	that	he	could	scan	the	white	emptiness	on	each	side	of	the	road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	like	being	on	the	moon.	Lifeless.	Gusts	battered	the	Audi	from	one	side and	then	the	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	came	to	a	crossroads	town,	the	only	one	in	twenty-five	miles,	and	thought about	stopping,	waiting	it	out.	The	car	in	front	of	him	turned	into	a	deserted parking	lot	by	a	closed	convenience	store.	He	kept	going. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	road	had	been	half	plowed,	but	the	plows	seemed	to	have	given	up	a	mile out	of	town.	He	could	no	longer	see	the	shoulders	of	the	road.	The	wind increased	as	he	began	to	climb	again.	He	might	have	turned	around,	but	he	was afraid	to	lose	his	momentum.	There	were	no	cars	on	the	road.	He	made	it	to	the top	of	a	hill,	crept	down,	and	started	up	again.	The	Audi	slid	to	a	stop	and	would go	no	farther.	He	had	gone	off	the	road	into	a	deeper	patch	and	was	hung	up	on the	frame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	got	out	and	staggered	in	a	blast	of	wind.	He	didn’t	even	have	boots.	There was	a	blanket	in	the	back	seat.	He	wrapped	it	around	him.	The	car	wasn’t	in	the middle	of	the	road,	at	least.	He	probably	wasn’t	going	to	get	rammed	by	a	truck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	felt	like	an	idiot.	Why	didn’t	he	take	the	turnpike’	He’d	been	over	this	road	a dozen	times,	but	always	in	summer.	He	didn’t	know	how	quickly	it	turned	into	a wasteland. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	walked	back	and	forth,	not	wanting	to	get	back	in	the	car	and	be	slowly erased	by	falling	snow.	Stay	with	the	car,	that’s	what	you’re	supposed	to	do.	The snow	eased	for	a	moment,	and	he	thought	he	saw	a	shape	in	front	of	him, something	standing.	He	looked	back,	not	wanting	to	lose	sight	of	the	car,	and moved	cautiously	forward.	It	was	a	mailbox	protruding	from	a	drift.	That’s	why he	hadn’t	gone	into	a	ditch,	he	realized.	He	was	in	the	entrance	to	a	driveway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Has	to	be	a	house	somewhere,	he	thought.	His	feet	were	getting	cold.	He wrapped	the	blanket	tighter.	I’ll	walk	for	five	minutes,	turn	around	if	I	don’t	see anything,	follow	my	tracks	back.	If	I	find	a	house,	I	can	call	Sal.	If	no	one’s</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a>there,	maybe	I	can	break	in.	He	walked	forward.	A	row	of	trees	loomed	blurrily on	his	left.	The	driveway	most	likely	followed	a	line	between	the	trees	and	the empty	white	on	his	right,	probably	a	field.	He	looked	behind	him.	His	tracks were	filling.	He	sped	up.	Five	minutes	later	he	stopped.	Nothing.	He	looked back.	Another	two,	three	minutes	and	that’s	it,	he	told	himself.	He	walked	faster, head	down,	and	stopped	again.	His	feet	hurt.	He	was	turning	around	when	the wind	shifted.	He	lifted	his	head.	Wood	smoke.	Unmistakable.	With	the	wind blowing	the	way	it	was,	it	couldn’t	be	far. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	continued	toward	the	smell.	A	small	house	with	a	porch	appeared	directly	in front	of	him.	There	was	a	light	in	the	window,	softened	by	swirling	snow.	He tramped	loudly	onto	the	porch	and	knocked	on	the	door.	‘Hello’	Anybody	home’</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	stuck	on	the	road.	Anybody	home?’	The	door	opened	and	Harry	looked down	at	a	thin	man	with	a	bald	pointed	head	and	intense	blue	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Come	in.’	He	looked	at	the	blanket	and	down	at	Harry’s	feet.	‘Guess	you’re	not from	around	here.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Maine,’	Harry	said,	stamping	the	snow	off	his	shoes	and	entering.	The	warmth struck	him	in	the	face.	He	wiped	his	eyes.	‘Pretty	nice	in	here.’	He	began	to shiver.	The	man	pointed	to	a	Windsor	chair	by	the	stove.	Harry	sat.	‘Thanks.	I was	colder	than	I	thought.	He	held	his	hands	over	the	stove.	‘Harry,	I’m	Harry.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Jared.	Water’s	hot.	Cup	of	tea	suit	you?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yes,	thank	you.’	The	little	guy	had	a	calming	influence.	He	seemed	to	be	in	a good	mood	for	someone	trapped	in	a	blizzard	on	Pluto.	A	large	orange	cat	on	a wicker	sofa	lifted	its	head	and	regarded	Harry.	Strange,	how	you	don’t	see	cats until	they	want	you	to.	‘Nice	cat.	What’s	his	name?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jared	was	in	the	kitchen	pouring	water	over	a	teabag.	‘Jake.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Big!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘He	came	one	night	and	never	left.	Five	years	ago.	Just	called	from	the	porch and	came	in.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Like	me,	but	don’t	worry,	I’ll	be	leaving	as	soon	as	it	lets	up.	I’ve	got	a	meeting in	Albany	at	five.	Doesn’t	look	too	good.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>‘Here	is	your	tea.	I	have	milk	and	honey.	There’s	a	lemon	in	the	bottom	of	the refrigerator.’	Harry	unwrapped	himself	and	went	into	the	kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Milk,	honey’great.’	Jared	set	the	containers	on	opposite	sides	of	the	mug, equidistant,	and	stepped	back.	Harry	loaded	up	on	honey.	‘Do	you	have	a telephone,	Jared?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Next	to	the	refrigerator.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Oh,	yes.	May	I	use	it	to	call	this	guy	I’m	supposed	to	meet?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Of	course.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	left	a	message,	saying	that	he	was	stuck	in	a	storm	and	wouldn’t	be	in Albany	until	the	next	morning.	He’d	call.	He	took	the	tea	back	by	the	stove	and sat	down.	‘Thanks,	Jared.	It’s	very	comfortable	in	here.	How	long	have	you	been in	this	house?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Eleven	years	this	fall.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Go	through	a	lot	of	wood,	I	bet.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	did	the	first	winter.	The	house	is	well	insulated	now.	Four	cords	are	usually enough.	I	get	a	considerable	amount	of	solar	gain	in	the	back.’	Jared	opened	a door	in	the	far	wall.	Harry	saw	a	large	room	with	tall	windows	and	what	looked like	a	stone	floor.	It	was	filled	with	plants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Nice.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Thank	you.	It	adds	a	great	deal	to	the	place.	I	sleep	there	now.	If	the	storm continues,	you	may	sleep	in	my	old	room.’	He	pointed	to	another	door.	‘But	I think	that	it	may	blow	through	quickly.	We	get	these	quite	often	up	here.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	hope	you’re	right.	Where	were	you	before	you	lived	here,	if	you	don’t	mind my	asking?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Antwerp,	Amsterdam,	Johannesburg,	New	York,	Brazil,	Columbia.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yo!	I’ve	been	to	the	Cayman	Islands,	Bermuda,	London,	Scotland.	That’s	about it.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>‘London	is	a	pleasant	city,’	Jared	said.	‘I’ve	had	very	fine	curry	there	in	the Indian	restaurants.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You’ve	been	all	over	the	place.	What	were	you	doing?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Diamond	cutting,	and	then	I	dealt	a	bit	in	precious	stones.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No	shit’	You	were	one	of	those	guys	who	looks	at	a	big	diamond	and	smacks	it with	a	hammer’brilliant	stone	or	rubble’one	shot?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jared	smiled.	‘I	was	trained	in	the	old	ways,	yes.	It’s	all	diamond	saws	and	fifty-eight	facets	now,	mathematically	determined,	a	function	of	diamond’s	index	of refraction.’	He	stroked	Ben.	‘Looks	and	smacks	doesn’t	quite	describe	it.	There was	a	great	deal	more	looking	than	smacking.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	must	have	had	a	knack	for	it.’	Harry	snapped	his	fingers,	‘A	knack	to	the smack,	knack	to	the	smack.	We’ve	got	a	song	here.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yes,’	Jared	said.	‘It’s	true,	I	suppose,	but	it	all	followed	from	the looking’coming	to	understand	the	grain	of	the	crystal,	its	flaws,	what	could	be made	of	it.	I	did	produce	a	certain	amount	of	rubble.’	My	biggest	mistakes	were from	impatience.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	bet	you	did	all	right,’	Harry	said.	‘Supposed	to	be	big	money	in	that	business.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Money	is	not	important.	Things	are	important.	Things	that	you	can	improve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Money	just	gets	you	there,	that’s	all.	I	regret	several	stones	that	I	ruined.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	into	money,’	Harry	said.	‘It’s	how	you	keep	score.	Real	estate.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	am	in	favor	of	real	estate,’	Jared	said.	‘One	of	the	best	things	to	improve.	I have	had	much	satisfaction	from	this	property.	If	it	weren’t	snowing,	I’d	show you	the	orchard	and	gardens.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	going	to	improve	an	old	wharf	in	Portland,	if	I	get	the	permits	and	the bucks.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Excellent,’	Jared	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘It	should	be.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a>‘You	have	a	difficulty?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘There’s	a	group	that	wants	to	keep	things	the	way	they’ve	been	for	a	hundred years.	Save	the	Harbor.	They’ve	got	some	votes	on	the	council.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Ah.’	Jared	put	his	fingertips	together.	‘Do	they	have	any	worthwhile arguments?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	can	see	why	they	wouldn’t	want	the	whole	waterfront	go	to	condos.	It	is	a beautiful	harbor.	Everybody	should	have	some	kind	of	access,	share	it.	I’m	only talking	about	one	wharf,	but	they’re	acting	like	it’s	the	whole	harbor	gone.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Is	there	a	way	that	your	project	might	further	their	aims?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Bribe	them,	you	mean!	Why	didn’t	I	think	of	that?’	The	room	brightened	as though	the	sky	had	also	had	a	good	idea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘One	must	try	to	work	with	what	is,’	Jared	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	remember	that.	Say,	that	orchard	of	yours,	you	got	apples	right?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Certainly.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Got	any	Macouns?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jared	crossed	the	room	and	took	a	book	from	a	cherry	bookshelf.	‘Macouns.’	He read	in	the	book.	‘Ah.	An	old	variety,	supposedly	a	challenge	to	grow.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Worth	it,’	Harry	said.	‘Best	apples	going.	We’ve	got	some	in	Maine;	I’ll	send you	some	trees.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘That	would	be	a	fine	bribe,	Harry.’	Jared	replaced	the	book.	‘But	it	isn’t necessary.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Wilmington,	Vermont.	Jared,	Jared	what?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Nathan.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Jared	Nathan’hey,	like	me,	two	first	names’Harry	George.	Is	that	sun’	Weird.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘It	sometimes	happens	this	way,’	Jared	said.	‘We	get	a	blizzard	for	a	few	hours, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a>and	down	below	they	get	an	inch.	You	might	get	to	Albany	tonight	after	all.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Maybe,	or	at	least	down	to	Bennington.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You’re	welcome	to	stay.	It	will	be	dark	in	an	hour.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Thanks.	I	need	to	be	getting	along.	I’m	hoping	for	an	early	meeting	tomorrow.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘The	plows	should	be	right	along,’	Jared	said.	He	found	a	pair	of	rubber overshoes	that	Harry	was	able	to	squeeze	into,	wearing	only	his	socks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fields	were	white	and	glistening.	A	breeze	blew	bits	of	snow	around	as	they carried	two	shovels	to	the	main	road.	They	had	the	car	nearly	dug	out	when	a plow	came	by	and	threw	a	three	foot	wall	of	snow	across	the	entrance	to	the driveway.	It	took	them	another	twenty	minutes	to	clear	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	took	off	the	boots	and	put	on	his	wet	shoes.	‘Should	do	it,’	he	said.	‘I	sure appreciate	your	help,	Jared.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jared	nodded.	‘Stop	in	again	sometime.	Good	luck	with	your	project.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘O.K.	Thanks.’	Harry	spun	his	way	out	onto	the	plowed	road.	He	beeped	twice and	gathered	speed,	heading	for	Bennington	as	Jared	walked	into	his	driveway, two	shovels	in	one	hand,	the	boots	in	the	other.	Strange	little	guy.	You	never know	who	you’re	going	to	run	into.	Piece	of	luck,	though. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	going	was	slow,	but	at	least	he	could	see.	Half	an	hour	later,	he	caught	up	to a	sander	at	the	top	of	the	steep	grade	down	to	Bennington.	He	followed	it	all	the way	into	town.	He	got	a	motel	room,	had	a	passable	lasagne	with	a	couple	of glasses	of	Chianti,	and	slept	soundly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	Albany	the	next	morning,	he	laid	out	the	project	for	Sal.	O’Malley’s	drawings were	impressive	when	Harry	looked	at	them	through	Sal’s	eyes.	Worth	the money.	Sal	was	hip	to	Portland’s	potential.	When	he	finished	asking	questions about	the	building,	he	said,	‘So	I	talked	to	Marty.	You’ve	done	business.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Right.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sal	nodded.	‘You	say	you	need	two	mill.	What’s	Marty	in	for?’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a>Harry	hesitated.	‘Seeing	as	you’re	cousins,	I	guess	I	can	say’half	a	mill.’	Sal’s eyes	flickered.	Competition	here.	Jealousy.	Work	with	what	is.	‘He	told	me	to get	back	to	him	after	I	talked	to	you.	I	don’t	know.	Maybe	he’ll	be	in	for	more.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	take	the	rest,	one	point	five.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Supremo!’	Harry	said.	‘You’re	a	smart	man;	that	gets	you	fifteen	percent	of	the profit	along	with	the	rest	of	the	stuff.	Fifteen	for	you,	five	for	Marty.’	That’s what	Sal	wanted	to	hear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘The	condo,’	Sal	said.	‘I	don’t	want	to	be	looking	at	a	dumpster,	know	what	I mean?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No	way.	Top	shelf.	Best	we	got.	You’re	the	man.’	Sal	reached	across	the	table and	picked	up	Harry’s	pen.	He	leaned	over	the	drawing	and	circled	one	of	the end	units.	‘It’s	yours,’	Harry	said.	‘You’re	going	to	love	it.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sal	handed	him	a	card.	‘You	want	front	money?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Nah.	I’ll	send	you	the	papers	tomorrow.’	Sal	reached	in	his	pocket	and	peeled off	five	one	hundred	dollar	bills.	‘Here	you	go,	have	a	good	time	on	the	way home.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘O.K.	All	right!	You’re	the	man.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	don’t	screw	around,’	Sal	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	put	the	money	away.	‘Oh	yeah,	I	forgot	to	mention’no	payment	on	the condo	for	five	years,	but	there’s	a	condo	fee,	starts	after	it’s	built,	same	for everybody.	Takes	care	of	the	maintenance,	keeps	up	the	value	of	the	place.	That going	to	be	a	problem’	I	should	have	said	something	before.	I’m	sorry.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Don’t	worry	about	it.’	Sal	pushed	back	his	chair	and	handed	Harry	his	pen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Nice	pen.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Keep	it,	Sal,	you	like	it.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yeah?’	Sal	put	the	pen	in	his	pocket.	‘I’ll	sign	your	check	with	it.’	He	turned and	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a>Harry	sat	back	and	exhaled.	He	was	excited	but	tired,	too.	These	goons	took	it out	of	you.	He	could	replace	his	Montblanc	and	have	a	hundred	dollars	left	over, but	then’would	he	think	of	Sal	every	time	he	used	it’	It	wasn’t	worth	losing	sleep over.	Maybe	he	should	make	it	a	tradition,	give	a	pen	to	every	major	investor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	thought	of	giving	Marty	a	good	pen	irritated	him.	Bad	idea.	He	gathered	up the	drawings	and	headed	for	the	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a><b class="calibre3">15</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Cait’s	mother	was	getting	worse.	They	flew	to	Wisconsin,	rented	a	car,	and drove	through	Green	Bay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	don’t	usually	get	this	way,	but	I’m	feeling	a	little’I	don’t	know’nervous,’	Ray said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘They’ll	love	you.	Look	there’s	Daddy!’	Cait	braked	and	jumped	out	of	the	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	trim	man,	gray	at	the	temples,	shut	off	the	lawn	mower	he	was	pushing	and took	her	in	his	arms.	Ray	got	out	and	hung	back	by	the	car.	Cait	led	her	father over,	holding	his	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Daddy,	this	is	Ray.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Hi,’	Ray	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Pete	Sullivan.’	He	appraised	Ray	for	a	moment	and	shook	hands.	Solid,	Ray thought.	He	could	see	Cait’s	energy,	channeled,	disciplined.	‘How	was	the	trip?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Good,’	Ray	said.	‘Nice	to	be	here.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Cait,	why	don’t	you	show	Ray	around	while	I	finish	up.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Lot	of	grass,’	Ray	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yep,	this	is	about	going	to	do	it	for	the	year.’	He	left	them	standing	together	and walked	slowly	back	to	the	mower.	Cait	and	Ray	were	silent.	He	was	going	to	be alone,	and	they	weren’t.	Pete	pulled	the	starter	cord	and	continued	toward	the other	end	of	the	yard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Poor	Daddy,’	Cait	said.	Ray	put	one	arm	around	her	shoulder.	She	took	a	deep breath.	‘Let’s	go	see	Mom.’	He	followed	her	into	the	house,	scraping	his	shoes several	times	on	the	door	mat.	After	three	years	in	Hawaii,	it	was	strange	not	to take	them	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cait’s	mother	was	upstairs	in	a	large	airy	bedroom,	resting	against	several pillows.	She	was	thin	and	pale,	smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a>‘Oh	Cait,	it	is	so	good	to	see	you.’	Her	eyes	were	dark	and	bright,	large	above sunken	cheeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cait	made	a	choking	sound	and	hugged	her	as	best	she	could.	‘Mom,	Mom,’	she said.	They	clung	to	each	other	for	a	long	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	have	a	beautiful	tan,’	her	mother	said	when	Cait	straightened.	‘Is	this	Ray?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yes,	oh.’	Cait	turned	to	him	and	he	approached	the	bed.	Her	mother	held	out	a hand.	Her	fingers	were	light	and	dry;	they	closed	around	his	with	surprising firmness,	drawing	him	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Let	me	look	at	you,’	she	said.	He	remembered	waiting	once	while	a	blind woman	felt	his	face	with	her	fingertips.	‘I	see,’	she	said.	‘Don’t	go	to	sleep	mad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pete	and	I	never?’	She	waited	for	a	flash	of	pain	to	subside.	The	mower	stopped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Thank	you,’	Ray	said.	He	put	his	other	hand	on	hers	and	imagined	picking	her up.	‘Do	you	want	to	go	outside?’	It	just	popped	out	of	his	mouth.	Her	eyes opened	wider.	She	smiled	like	a	girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	am	outside.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	mower	started	again.	Her	eyes	closed.	‘I’m	going	to	sleep	a	little,	now.’	Ray returned	her	hand	and	looked	at	Cait.	She	was	biting	one	knuckle.	He	touched her	arm.	They	walked	carefully	out	and	down	the	stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	knew	she	was	in	bad	shape,’	Cait	said	finally,	‘but	I	didn’t	expect’.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	see	where	you	got	your	looks.	Not	the	eyes,	though.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Sullivan	eyes,’	Cait	said.	They	put	their	bags	in	Cait’s	old	room,	a	corner	room shaded	by	a	maple,	and	went	outside.	They	sat	on	the	porch	steps	and	watched Cait’s	father	put	away	the	mower.	When	he	was	done,	he	sat	beside	them	on	a lower	step. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘A	nurse	comes	twice	a	day,’	he	said.	‘She	has	some	good	days	and	some	bad.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Are	you	getting	enough	sleep,	Daddy?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	make	it.’	After	a	time,	he	said,	‘We	owe	God	a	death;	he	that	dies	this	year	is</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a>quit	for	the	next,’	he	told	the	tree.	‘Richard	IV.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	thought	you	were	a	coach,’	Ray	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘They	make	Daddy	teach	English,	sometimes.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Of	course,	if	you’re	a	soldier	you	have	to	expect	a	little	coming	back	at	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Steffie	never	hurt	anybody.	Only	brought	life.	Never	took	it.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘For	sure,’	Cait	said.	‘Unlike	some	of	us.’	Her	father	patted	her	knee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	can’t	beat	yourself	up	forever,	Honey.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	try	and	make	it	up	to	Jenna,	but	she	won’t	talk	to	me.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Jenna’s	got	to	do	things	in	her	own	time.	She	knows	you’re	sorry.	I	guess	Cait’s told	you	about	all	this,’	he	said	to	Ray. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yep.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	am	a	coach.	I	heard	you	played	a	little	ball.	Have	a	catch?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Sure.’	Ray	stood	and	stretched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Not	too	much	time	left	for	grilling	brats	outside,’	Pete	said	to	Cait.	‘You	want	to take	care	of	that’	There’s	potato	salad	in	the	fridge.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘That’s	affirmative,’	Cait	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pete	went	in	the	house	and	came	out	with	a	football.	He	spun	it	a	few	times	and lateraled	to	Ray.	The	ball	felt	good,	solid,	pumped	up,	broken	in.	‘Been	a	while,’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ray	said.	He	moved	his	hand	around	the	ball,	feeling	the	seams	and	laces, shaking	his	wrist.	Pete	walked	into	the	yard	and	caught	a	short	flip.	He	backed up	a	few	steps	and	threw	it	to	Ray. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Great	time	of	year.	Green	Bay	is	something	special	in	football	season.’	He backed	up	a	few	more	steps	and	took	a	soft	pass	from	Ray.	They	threw	back	and forth,	gradually	increasing	the	distance	between	them.	Pete	would	catch	and turn,	jog	a	couple	of	steps.	He	threw	a	harder	pass	to	Ray	and	stepped	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Don’t	be	messing	up	my	tree,	now!’	Ray	threw	another	pass,	harder,	on	a	lower</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a>line,	a	couple	of	feet	beneath	an	overhanging	branch.	Pete	caught	it,	backed	up some	more,	took	a	breath,	and	delivered	another,	just	below	the	branch.	Ray caught	it	and	looked	up.	Pete’s	face	had	gone	hard	behind	his	grin.	It’s	a	test, Ray	realized.	Well	all	right.	Let’s	get	it	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	familiar	coolness	spread	through	him.	Game	time.	He	took	a	five	step	drop, looked	off	the	safety,	pivoted	and	delivered	to	Pete,	right	in	his	hands.	Pete caught	it,	although	it	knocked	him	back	half	a	step.	This	time	he	didn’t	turn	and run	upfield.	He	stood	there,	spun	the	ball	once	in	his	hands	and	then	walked toward	Ray. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Where’d	you	play?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Maine.	High	school.	A	little	college.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘We	could	have	used	you	around	here.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yeah,	I	like	football.	I	was	better	at	baseball.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What	position?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Catcher.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Figures.	Why	did	you	quit?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	don’t	know.	They	wanted	robots’interchangeable	parts.	It	wasn’t	fun	anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	all	about	winning	and	not	about	the	game.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘This	is	Vince	Lombardi	country,’	Pete	said.	‘Winning	is	the	only	thing.	That’s religion	around	here.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Not	my	religion,’	Ray	said.	‘No	disrespect	to	Vince	Lombardi.’	He	shook	his head.	‘What	do	you	call	a	team	that	plays	over	their	heads,	plays	a	great	game, and	comes	up	a	run	short	in	the	ninth’losers?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ve	seen	a	lot	of	players,’	Pete	said.	‘I	could	have	gone	a	long	ways	with	what you’ve	got.	I	had	to	try	to	make	up	with	drills,	practice.	You	know,	outwork	the other	guy.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">They	continued	toward	the	house	in	silence.	‘Maybe	I’m	wrong?’	Pete	spoke	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a>different	tone.	‘But	I’ve	got	the	feeling	you’re	holding	something	back.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	sorry,’	Ray	said.	‘I	got	in	trouble.	I	can’t	go	back	home	right	now.	Nothing serious,	but	they	want	me	to	do	jail	time.	I	can’t	tell	you	anything	else	without putting	you	in	a	bad	spot.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Shit,’	Pete	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘They	can’t	get	me	as	long	as	I	don’t	go	home.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘That	isn’t	good.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	guess	what	it	comes	down	to’do	you	love	Cait?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yes.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pete	made	up	his	mind.	He	tossed	the	ball	to	Ray.	Ray	looked	at	the	ball,	threw	it back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘O.K.,’	Pete	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later,	in	bed,	Ray	said	to	Cait,	‘I	love	being	with	you,	but	I	didn’t	realize’it	isn’t just	you’it’s	your	mom	and	your	dad,	too.	And	I	haven’t	even	met	your	sister.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘She’s	coming	tomorrow.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ray	was	too	tired	to	worry	about	it.	When	he	woke	up	the	next	morning,	Cait was	already	in	the	kitchen	talking	with	Pete.	He	slept	half	an	hour	more	and dressed.	Cait	was	outside	on	the	steps	with	a	cup	of	coffee.	He	poured	himself	a cup	and	joined	her.	The	day	was	clear	and	chilly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Football	weather,’	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Daddy’s	gone	to	practice.	He’ll	be	back	for	lunch.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘So,	what’s	the	plan?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘How	about	we	drive	around’	I’ll	show	you	where	I	went	to	school.	Go	by	the lake.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>‘Don’t	forget	where	you	had	your	first	kiss.’	Cait	put	one	hand	on	each	of	his ears	and	kissed	him	long	and	hard.	‘There,’	she	said.	‘It	was	right	here.	Now	I can’t	remember	it.’	They	rode	through	town,	along	the	lake,	and	out	into	the country.	The	fields	were	large,	the	sky	wide	open.	It	was	good	to	be	in	the	north again,	but	Ray	already	missed	the	Pacific.	Lake	Michigan	seemed	like	a	big bathtub.	‘Daddy	likes	you,’	Cait	said.	‘He’s	worried	about	the	trouble,	though. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	doesn’t	want	me	to	get	hurt.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Me,	neither.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jenna	was	there	when	they	got	back.	She	and	Cait	exchanged	a	quick	formal	hug and	looked	at	each	other.	Jenna	was	as	tall	as	Cait	but	thinner.	Same	blue	eyes, flecked	with	green.	Same	dark	hair,	but	Jenna’s	was	cut	short	and	curled	up	at the	ends,	giving	her	an	older	look.	She	was	a	school	psychologist	in	a	suburb	of Milwaukee.	At	lunch,	she	was	definite,	had	answers.	Ray	kept	quiet.	Jenna	was not	impressed	that	he	drove	a	cab.	Nor	was	she	especially	interested	in	Cait’s	life or	art	work.	She	wasn’t	mean,	he	didn’t	think.	It	was	just	that	she	didn’t	see much	outside	her	world.	Pete	treated	her	with	warmth	and	respect.	When	she left,	in	the	late	afternoon,	Ray	let	out	a	deep	breath.	He	hadn’t	realized	that	he was	holding	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ray	and	Cait	did	the	dishes.	He	was	beginning	to	feel	more	comfortable	in	the house.	Cait’s	mom	was	tired	but	happy	to	have	everyone	together.	They	played cribbage	with	Pete	and	went	to	bed	early. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Overnight,	there	was	frost.	Pete	and	Ray	carried	storm	windows	up	from	the cellar	and	arranged	a	work	place	in	the	garage.	They	were	heavy	old-fashioned wooden	windows,	meant	to	last,	in	need	of	glazing	and	painting.	During	the	next several	days,	Ray	worked	on	them	whenever	something	else	wasn’t	happening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	replaced	two	cracked	panes,	patched	putty,	scraped	and	primed	and	painted each	one	on	both	sides.	Once	he	looked	up	and	saw	Cait	holding	her	mother	by an	upstairs	window.	He	waved	and	they	waved	back,	slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	the	time	he	and	Cait	packed	to	catch	their	plane,	he	felt	good	about	the	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	wasn’t	like	having	another	home,	exactly.	But	it	was	somewhere	he	could come	back	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	long	flight	to	Honolulu,	they	snoozed	and	talked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘She’s	always	been	like	that,’	Cait	said,	about	Jenna.	‘Straight	A’s,	went	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a>University	at	Madison.	She	always	did	the	right	thing.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Pretty	serious,’	Ray	said.	‘She	have	a	boyfriend?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	think	she’s	seeing	somebody.	She	doesn’t	talk	about	him.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Probably	the	principal,’	Ray	said.	Cait	giggled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	can	see	her	sneaking	around.	Dark	glasses	in	Milwaukee.	Mom	likes	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’s	worried	we’re	never	going	to	get	married.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘We	can	take	care	of	that.	You	want	to?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cait	looked	at	him,	eyes	flashing.	‘Yes.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Well,	all	right!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘All	right!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ray	signaled	one	of	the	stewardesses.	‘Couple	of	beers,’	he	said	when	she paused	by	their	seats,	‘we’re	getting	married.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Oooo,	congratulations!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">They	toasted	the	moment	and	fell	into	decision	mode.	Cait	said	that	she	didn’t want	to	make	a	big	deal	about	it,	the	ceremony	and	all.	‘Mother’s	too	tired.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘We	can’t	go	to	Maine.	Let’s	just	do	it.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘This	week?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Why	not’	Do	you	think	we	should	get	a	bigger	place’	My	lease	is	almost	up.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘We	could,	but	maybe	it	would	be	better	to	squeeze	into	my	place	for	awhile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Save	money.’	They	talked	it	over.	Driving	a	cab	and	waiting	on	tables	wasn’t forever.	Maybe	Cait	would	go	back	to	school.	Maybe	he’d	get	some	more	tools and	a	truck.	Whatever	they	did	was	going	to	cost	money.	By	the	time	the	plane banked	over	Diamond	Head,	they	felt	as	though	they	were	already	married. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	warm	scented	air	at	the	terminal	reminded	Ray	of	landing	on	the	island	for the	first	time.	He	heard	a	dove	call	and	felt	grateful’just	to	be	there.	There	with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a>Cait. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	mother’s	birthday	came	around	again,	and	he	went	out	to	the	airport	to	order her	flowers.	He	waited	in	line	behind	a	customer	and	thought	that	his	mother didn’t	even	know	he	was	married.	It	didn’t	seem	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Hello,	Charley.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	voice	froze	him	from	behind.	He	couldn’t	pretend	that	he	was	someone	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	slowly,	his	expression	neutral.	Roland	was	standing	there	in	khakis and	a	new	aloha	shirt.	His	eyes	dropped	to	Roland’s	waist.	He	thought	he	saw	a holster	bulge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	off	duty,	man.’	Charley	waited,	balanced,	unsure.	‘Thought	I’d	see	if	you were	going	to	send	your	mom	any	more	flowers.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Jesus,	Roland.’	Charley	started	to	smile.	‘Hell	of	a	shirt	you	got	there.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	like	it’	Therese	picked	it	out.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Therese!	How’s	she	doing?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Good.	She’s	on	the	beach	right	now	with	the	kids.’	Charley	stepped	away	from the	flower	stall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	put	a	scare	on	me,	Roland.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	see	that.’	Roland	was	pleased	with	himself.	His	moustache	was	shining.	‘I	had vacation	coming.	I	said	to	Therese,	why	not	get	one	of	those	package	deals	to Waikiki’	Live	a	little.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘She	know	I’m	here?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No.	Shit,	I	didn’t	know	you	were	here.	But	I	ran	down	those	flower	orders’right around	this	time	every	year	from	this	location.	I	figured,	what	the	hell,	what have	I	got	to	lose’	I	ain’t	much	for	beaches,	anyway;	I’ll	just	hang	out	and	see	if Charley	shows	up.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Son	of	a	bitch,	Roland.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a>‘Listen,	Larsen	is	still	after	you.	If	I	can	find	you,	maybe	somebody	else	can. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	you	might	be	thinking	about	some	other	way	to	say	hello	to	your	mom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Don’t	use	the	telephone,	though.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Don’t	worry,’	Charley	said.	‘Good	to	see	you,	Roland.	Feels	good	to	be	Charley again.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	got	a	new	name,	I	guess.	New	something	on	your	finger,	too.’	Roland	was grinning	broadly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Oh,	yeah.	I	got	married.	We	got	married.	You	shouldn’t	be	knowing	this	stuff.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Don’t	worry	about	it.	Look’I	try	to	do	my	job;	don’t	get	me	wrong.	But,	being	a good	officer	is	about	using	your	judgement.	If	I	arrested	everybody	who	was OUI	on	Saturday	night,	we’d	need	ten	more	jails.	What	good	is	it	going	to	do	to lock	you	up’	Besides,	Harry	George	got	off.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘How	did	he	do	that?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Money.	The	usual.	Larsen’s	Youth	Center	got	a	big	grant	from	the	George Foundation	a	year,	year	and	a	half,	later.	Harry	paid	a	ten	grand	fine,	apologized, got	off	with	community	service	and	parole.	He	would	have	had	to	do	hard	time, but	they	reduced	the	charges.	His	statement	said	it	was	your	deal,	that	you	just asked	him	to	be	there	in	case	you	needed	money.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Fucking	Harry,’	Charley	said.	‘I	only	made	a	couple	of	deliveries	for	him.	He had	a	house	in	Carrabassett,	up	at	the	end	of	the	valley,	where	he	kept	the	stuff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	three	or	four	dealers	in	different	parts	of	the	state.	He	was	big	time, didn’t	sell	anything	himself.	He	used	to	talk	about	a	place	he	went	to	in	the Cayman	Islands	a	couple	of	times	a	year.	I	think	he	was	stashing	money	down there.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Everybody	knew	it	was	bullshit,’	Roland	said.	‘But’you	weren’t	around.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Charley	looked	at	his	shoes	for	a	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Well,	thanks	for	keeping	quiet,	Roland.	I’m	obliged.’	Roland	shrugged.	‘But	I don’t	know	what	to	do	about	the	flowers.	My	mom	will	be	awful	worried	if	they don’t	come.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘So	will	half	the	town,’	Roland	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>‘That	bad,	huh?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Things	have	a	way	of	getting	out.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	guess	I’ll	send	one	last	bunch	and	figure	out	another	way	to	let	her	know	I’m O.K.	You	got	time	for	a	beer?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Hey,	I’m	on	vacation.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">They	talked	baseball	and	old	times.	Uncle	Jack	was	calling	it	quits,	and	Darlene had	worked	out	a	way	to	buy	the	diner.	The	city	was	growing,	but	otherwise things	were	pretty	much	the	same.	Charley	dropped	Roland	off	at	the	Outrigger Surf	a	couple	of	hours	later.	When	he	got	home,	he	was	full	of	things	to	tell	Cait. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	waited	until	he	was	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	like	him,’	she	said.	‘Now’I	have	something	to	tell	you.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What’s	that?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	pregnant!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What!	No	shit?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No	shit.	I	found	out	this	afternoon.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Whoooa!’	He	took	her	in	his	arms	gently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	won’t	break,’	she	said.	He	swung	her	off	the	floor	and	around.	‘That’s	so great!	There’s	three	of	us.	Look	out	world!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Look	out	world,’	Cait	said	as	he	set	her	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a><b class="calibre3">16</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	stopped	by	T’s	Oyster	Bar	more	often.	Angel	was	usually	working	at happy	hour.	They	joked	around.	When	it	got	crazy,	she	would	raise	her	eyebrows at	him,	and	he	would	nod	sympathetically.	Guys	hit	on	her	constantly.	They didn’t	get	far.	She	was	the	original	mixed	message.	Her	hot	body	concealed	a cool	will	power	that	Harry	understood.	As	the	weeks	went	by,	she	grew	older and	he	felt	younger.	He	was	sometimes	late	for	dinner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Family	life	settled	into	a	routine.	He	and	Lynn	and	Fergus	often	went	to	his mother’s	for	lunch	or	dinner	during	the	weekend.	She	got	along	with	Lynn	better than	Harry	had	expected.	She	was	playful	with	Fergus	and	confided	in	Lynn	that she	might	have	been	a	bit	too	stiff	with	Harry	as	a	child.	‘Mother?’	he	said	in mock	surprise	when	Lynn	told	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Haven’t	heard	much	from	Dad,’	he	observed	at	dinner	one	Saturday	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elizabeth	frowned	delicately	and	wiped	her	mouth	with	a	napkin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	am	sure	things	will	work	out	for	him,	but	I	am	a	bit	worried,’	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What’s	wrong?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	don’t	have	the	details.	Something	to	do	with	a	business	arrangement.	Rather more	serious,	this	time.	When	we	talked	a	few	days	ago,	he	said	that	he	thought he	was	going	to	have	to	sell	his	boat.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Oh,	no!’	Lynn	said.	‘That	beautiful	old	boat?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘En	Garde,’	Harry	said.	‘Never	happen.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Your	father	has	done	well	over	the	years,	but	lately	he	seems	to	be	less’engaged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	will	be	up	next	weekend.	Perhaps	you	can	talk	about	it	with	him,	Dear.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Listen,	you	mean.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Elizabeth	smiled	patiently,	exchanging	a	glance	with	Lynn.	‘It	would	be	very nice	to	see	you.	I	do	hope	you	can	come	over.	Ben	is	quite	around	the	bend	about Fergus.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>The	next	day,	Harry	stopped	in	at	the	marina.	He	asked	a	young	salesman whether	En	Garde	was	for	sale.	To	his	surprise,	she	was	listed	for	$97,500. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘History	afloat,	immaculate	condition,’	the	salesman	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	give	you	ninety	for	it,’	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘She’s	a	hell	of	a	boat.	You	want	to	take	a	look	at	her?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	know	the	boat.	I’ll	give	you	a	check	right	now.	But	there’s	a	condition:	this	is	a private	deal.	No	one	knows	who	bought	it.	Not	the	present	owner,	nobody.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘We	can	do	that.	But,	I	don’t	know	if	the	owner	will	take	ninety.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Offer’s	good	for	48	hours.	I’ll	get	back	to	you	by	Wednesday	noon.	Be	right back	with	the	check.’	Harry	went	to	the	car	and	opened	his	briefcase.	He	could cover	the	check	with	fifty	to	spare.	‘For	purchase	of	En	Garde,	fully	equipped,	as is,’	he	wrote	on	the	check	and	handed	it	to	the	salesman.	‘Enjoy	that commission,	Buddy,’	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Bill,	uh,	Bill,’	the	guy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	call	Wednesday.’	Harry	left	him	holding	the	check	with	a	dazed	expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looked	like	he’d	never	had	a	lucky	day.	Sometimes,	spending	money	was	fun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wednesday,	he	learned	that	his	offer	had	been	refused.	‘Ninety-five,’	Bill	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘The	owner	said	anybody	was	lucky	to	get	it	for	that,	and	he	wouldn’t	take	a dime	less.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘O.K.,’	Harry	said.	‘I’ll	be	there	in	half	an	hour	with	a	check	for	five	grand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Polish	those	keys	for	me.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yes,	Sir,’	Bill	said.	‘Thank	you.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">En	Garde	was	out	of	the	water,	up	on	stands,	and	wrapped.	Harry	walked	around her	twice	and	traded	the	check	for	the	keys	and	the	papers,	pre-signed	by	his father.	When	he	got	home,	he	put	them	in	a	large	manila	envelope.	He	didn’t	tell Lynn.	This	was	something	between	his	father	and	him;	it	didn’t	involve	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Angel	thought	it	was	great	that	he’d	bought	his	father’s	boat.	Harry	didn’t explain	any	of	the	details.	‘Wish	someone	would	buy	me	a	boat,’	she	said.	‘I’d</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a>like	to	just	go	away	on	it,	maybe	see	Florida	and	down	around	there.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	can’t	buy	two	boats	in	one	week,’	Harry	said.	Angel	made	a	pout	face,	but	she was	pleased;	he’d	considered	it.	‘You	like	boats’	We	ought	to	go	out	sometime when	it	warms	up.	Rent	one,	or	maybe	I’ll	pick	one	up	if	I	can	get	a	decent price.’	Her	eyes	fixed	on	his	for	a	moment	and	began	to	yield.	Warm	almond. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yeah,’	she	said,	‘if	it	ever	warms	up	and	I	ever	get	a	day	off.’	Harry	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	didn’t	say	anything	else,	but	they	had	a	date	of	sorts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	was	in	a	good	mood	when	he	got	home.	Fergus	was	crawling	all	over	the place.	Lynn	had	made	a	lemon	meringue	pie.	It	was	cold	and	dark	by	4:30,	but the	days	would	soon	begin	to	lengthen.	Nothing	much	happened	that	evening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	ordinary	night,	really.	But	the	picture	of	it	remained	clear	in	Harry’s	mind when	he’d	forgotten	nearly	everything	else	about	that	winter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	Saturday,	they	arrived	promptly	at	cocktail	hour	for	dinner	with	Harry’s parents.	Ben	had	a	big	smile	for	Lynn	and	made	a	great	show	of	consulting Mickey	on	his	wrist.	‘Definitely	over	the	yard	arm,’	he	said	and	began	making drinks.	Fergus	headed	straight	for	Elizabeth,	soaking	up	attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ben	proposed	a	toast	to	Fergus,	‘the	youngest	George,’	in	a	less	commanding tone	than	usual.	They	drank	and	clapped.	Fergus	sat	up	on	the	Persian	carpet	like a	prairie	dog. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘A	little	bird	told	me	you	had	some	hard	going,’	Harry	said	to	his	father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yes.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Headwinds,’	Harry	suggested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘More	like	a	typhoon,	I’m	afraid.’	Ben	sipped	Laphroiag.	‘I	got	careless.	Made	a couple	of	mistakes.	Then	I	got	mad	and	made	a	big	mistake.	I	went	double	or nothing,	so	to	speak.	You’d	think	I’d	know	better.	Sometimes,	you’ve	got	to	cut your	losses,	take	your	beating,	and	move	on.	I	blew	it.	The	worst	thing	is’I	had to	sell	En	Garde.’	Ben	raised	his	glass.	‘En	Garde?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">They	drank	to	En	Garde.	Harry	went	into	the	hall	and	brought	back	the	manila envelope	he’d	left	with	his	coat.	He	reached	inside	and	tossed	the	keys	onto	the cocktail	table	in	front	of	his	father.	They	landed	with	a	clatter	and	slid	against	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a>silver	cheese	tray.	‘May	she	sail	on,’	Harry	said.	‘I	bought	her	for	you.’	He	put the	envelope	on	the	table	next	to	the	keys.	‘Here’s	the	papers.	We’re	even	for	the court	fine	and	all	that	tuition.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ben	flushed	and	looked,	not	at	Harry,	but	at	his	mother.	Lynn’s	mouth	was slightly	open.	Fergus	swiveled	around,	waiting	for	someone	to	make	noise.	‘You drive	a	hard	bargain,’	Harry	said,	‘knocked	me	up	five	grand.’	His	father	and mother	were	sharing	something	without	words,	something	sad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘They	wouldn’t	tell	me	who	bought	her,’	his	father	said,	finally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yeah,	that	was	part	of	the	deal.	My	corporation	owned	her.	She’s	signed	back over	to	you.’	He	pointed	at	the	envelope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Quite	a	surprise.’	The	air	was	flat	and	heavy,	not	what	Harry	expected.	‘You’ve done	well,’	his	father	said,	the	words	offered	more	as	fact	than	compliment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fergus	made	a	complaining	sound,	and	Lynn	put	him	on	her	lap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Making	progress,’	Harry	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ben	took	another	sip	of	whisky.	‘You	know,’	he	said,	‘she’s	all	wrapped	up	for the	winter.	I	might	just	have	her	trucked	to	Virginia	and	take	her	down	the waterway.	Live	aboard.	Get	back	to	basics.’	He’d	talked	about	this	many	times; it	seemed	like	an	extension	of	earlier	conversation,	except	that	he	sounded	as though	he	meant	it.	There	was	a	quietness	around	the	word	‘basic’	that	was	new to	Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Your	basic	forty-two	footer,’	Harry	said.	Ben	shrugged.	There	wasn’t	any	fight in	him.	Harry	felt	cheated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Perhaps	we	should	move	to	the	dining	room,’	his	mother	suggested.	They proceeded	with	dinner,	but	cheerfulness	had	gone	for	the	evening.	His	father thanked	him	for	the	boat	when	they	left.	He	said	goodbye	in	a	soft	way	that Harry	didn’t	understand,	as	though	he	were	giving	something	to	Harry,	instead of	the	other	way	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Don’t	run	into	any	bridges,’	Harry	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Once	was	enough.	Night,	Lynn.	Night,	Fergus.’	Ben	put	a	big	hand	on	top	of Fergus’s	blue	woolen	watch	cap.	‘So	nice	to	see	you	all.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a>‘Good	night,	Dears,’	his	mother	called. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Thank	you	so	much,’	Lynn	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Halfway	down	the	driveway,	Harry	exploded.	‘What	was	that	all	about!	Jesus!	I save	his	precious	boat,	and	I	get	treated	like	an	axe	murderer.’	Fergus	joined	in, complaining	loudly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘There,	there,	it’s	all	right,	Precious.	You	were	a	very	good	boy,	very	good.	Best in	the	whole	world.	We’re	going	home	now.	You	might	have	told	me,’	Lynn	said, turning	back	to	him.	‘I	felt	a	bit	stupid	being	as	surprised	as	everybody	else.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	guess	I	should	have	said	something.	I	don’t	know.	I	take	care	of	the	money; you	take	care	of	the	house.	I	couldn’t	believe	it.	He	just	sat	there.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘It	was	wonderful	of	you	to	buy	En	Garde	for	him.	Maybe	you	could	have	told him	a	little	differently.	I	mean,	I	can	see	why	you’d	want	to	pay	back	the	fine; that	happened	after	you	were	grown	up.	But,	tuition’	Maybe	he	was	proud	of paying	for	your	education.	Wouldn’t	you	feel	that	way	about	Fergus?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	didn’t	have	to	listen	to	all	his	reminders	over	the	years.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No.’	They	turned	off	the	main	road.	‘People	change	sometimes,’	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Believe	it	when	I	see	it.’	It	was	upsetting	to	think	of	his	father	changing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘He	sounded	serious	about	sailing	south.	What	did	he	say’get	back	to	basics?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘He’s	been	saying	that	for	years.	I	mean,	he’s	a	tough	son	of	a	bitch.	And	so	am I.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Well,	of	course	you	are,’	Lynn	said.	‘Of	the	two	of	them,	I	think	your	mother’s the	tough	one.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘She’s	no	pushover.	It’s	true.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lynn	carried	Fergus	into	the	house	and	put	him	to	bed.	She	told	Harry	that	she was	going	to	read	for	awhile.	‘I’m	going	to	watch	a	game,’	he	said.	‘I’m	feeling a	little	torqued.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a>‘Don’t	stay	up	too	late.’	She	brushed	a	hand	over	his	hair	and	went	to	bed.	Harry sat	in	front	of	the	TV,	not	involved	in	the	game,	thinking	about	his	business deals.	It	was	calming	to	think	about	things	that	he	had	control	over,	or,	if	not control,	at	least	he	could	act.	They	were	his	deals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marty	was	going	to	be	in	town	the	next	day.	They	had	a	meeting	to	talk	about	the project,	2:30	at	T’s,	a	late	lunch	or	an	early	drink.	The	permits	were	still	in process	at	the	city	council.	Funding	from	Marty	and	his	cousin,	Sal,	was contingent	on	project	approval.	He	was	cutting	it	a	little	close.	Buying	En	Garde had	taken	most	of	his	reserve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	opened	his	briefcase	and	made	notes.	He	began	to	feel	better	and	did	not	take it	personally	when	the	Celtics	lost.	Fergus	was	sleeping	like	a	cherub	when	he went	upstairs.	Lynn	turned	over,	mumbled,	and	went	back	to	sleep.	Harry	slid under	the	covers	and	lay	there,	seeing	his	parents	exchange	glances.	You’d	think he	was	twelve	or	something.	He	put	them	out	of	his	mind	and	imagined	Angel on	the	beach.	Much	better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	afternoon,	at	T’s,	Angel	wore	more	than	a	bikini,	not	that	it	made	much difference.	Her	body	always	seemed	ready	to	burst	out	of	her	clothes.	Even heavy	sweaters	had	a	pleading,	take	me	off	quality	when	she	wore	them.	Harry wondered	if	she	were	embarrassed	by	her	body.	She	dressed	plainly,	as	though she	were	trying	to	look	like	her	grandmother.	I’ve	got	enough	trouble,	she seemed	to	be	saying.	Today	she	was	wearing	a	white	cotton	blouse,	rolled	back at	her	wrists,	and	a	chino	skirt	cut	modestly	above	the	knees.	She	leaned	toward him	to	say	hello,	and	he	had	to	stop	his	arms	from	opening	to	receive	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Don’t	you	look	good,’	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled.	‘Do	you	think	my	hair’s	too	long?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No.	No,	longer	is	better.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Angel	ran	the	fingers	of	her	left	hand	slowly	through	her	hair,	adjusting	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Maybe	a	little	longer,’	she	said.	‘What’s	happening	today?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Meeting	somebody	here	in	a	couple	of	minutes.	I	came	early	so	I	could	get	a look	at	you.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	need	a	drink;	that’s	what	you	need.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>‘Good	idea.	It’s	shitty	out	there.’	Sleet	rattled	against	the	large	window	and sliced	into	the	harbor.	‘I	think	it’s	a	rum	kind	of	day.	How	about	a	Planter’s Punch?’	Angel	scribbled	on	her	pad	and	walked	slowly	toward	the	bar.	She	was young	and	strong,	but	there	was	reluctance	in	her	steps,	as	though	she	were	tired of	fighting	gravity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	taste	of	rum	brought	back	the	Cayman	Islands.	Someone	played	a	James Taylor	song,	I’ve	seen	fire,	and	I’ve	seen	rain.	I’ve	seen	sunny	days	that	I thought	would	never	end.	But	I	always	thought	I’d	see	you	one	more	time	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Angel	leaned	over	farther	than	necessary	to	put	a	dish	of	pretzels	in	front	of	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	eyes	rested	between	her	breasts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Well,	well!’	Marty	was	a	shock.	Harry	looked	up	to	see	Marty	grinning	at Angel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Uncle	Marty!’	She	hugged	him	and	he	patted	her	hard	on	the	back,	twice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Good	to	see	you,	Princess,’	he	said.	‘How’s	your	mom?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘She’s	fine.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	see	you	next	week.	You	behaving	yourself?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Always	do.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Marty	knocked	Harry	on	the	shoulder.	‘Harry,	this	is	my	niece,	Angel.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	figured	that	out.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Bring	me	a	beer,	would	you	Princess?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Amstel	light?’	Marty	nodded	and	sat	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘My	sister	Danny’s	only	kid.’	He	lowered	his	voice.	‘I	keep	an	eye	on	her.	Her old	man	is	on	a	long	holiday	in	New	York,	know	what	I	mean’	Five	more	years.	I told	Danny	not	to	marry	that	punk.	What	are	you	going	to	do’	What	are	you going	to	do?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	don’t	know,’	Harry	said.	The	Caymans	had	disappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a>‘Well,	maybe	I	got	some	say	with	Angel.’	Angel	brought	his	beer	and	poured	it into	a	glass	for	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Here’s	to	you,	Sweetheart,’	Marty	said.	Harry	also	raised	his	glass.	Angel	went over	to	a	customer	in	the	far	corner,	and	Marty	turned	to	Harry.	‘I	see	you looking	at	her	when	I	come	in.	She	ain’t	for	you.	Keep	your	fucking	hands	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	get	my	meaning?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Loud	and	clear.	Jesus,	Marty’who	wouldn’t	look,	for	Christ’s	sake?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yeah,’	Marty	said,	leaning	back.	‘Look.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Besides,	I’m	married.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yeah,	and	Santa’s	a	transvestite.’	Harry	laughed	in	spite	of	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘That’s	funny,	Marty.	I	don’t	know	why.	But	it’s	funny.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	a	funny	man,	Harry,	when	I’m	making	money.	How’s	our	little	project?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘The	Save	the	Harbor	people	turned	down	the	contribution	I	had	figured	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Said	it	was	greed	money.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Dumb	asses,’	Marty	said.	‘It’s	going	to	happen	anyway.	They	should	have	taken it.	What	about	the	rest	of	the	council?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘It	keeps	getting	delayed.	Pisses	me	off.	I	had	to	shell	out	for	a	six	month extension	on	the	option.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘When	was	that?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Last	month,’	Harry	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Better	get	on	the	stick.	Don’t	let	‘em	jerk	you	around.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	working	on	it.	I’ve	got	a	pretty	good	connection	with	Larsen.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Let	me	know,’	Marty	said,	pushing	back	his	chair.	‘The	check’s	waiting.	By	the way,	Sal’s	been	telling	me	how	good	his	condo	unit	is.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yours	is	just	as	good,	believe	me,	Marty.	Maybe	better.’	Marty	nodded	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a>dropped	a	twenty	on	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘That’s	for	Angel,’	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yeah,	Marty.	I’ll	get	back	to	you	next	week	or	as	soon	as	I	hear	anything.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Marty	strolled	over	to	Angel,	hugged	her,	said	something	in	her	ear,	and	left.	The sleet	was	changing	to	rain.	Drops	made	tracks	down	the	window,	merged	and slid	faster.	What	a	goon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	minutes	later,	Angel	sat	beside	him.	‘We	got	to	talk,’	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What’s	the	matter’	You	look	pale.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	can’t	tell	you	now;	it’s	getting	busy.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Is	it	your	Uncle	Marty?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yes.’	She	glanced	around	at	the	tables.	‘He’s	kind	of’old-fashioned.	I	can’t	talk now.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	working	tomorrow?’	Angel	nodded,	close	to	tears.	‘I’ll	come	when	it’s slow.	We’ll	talk.	We’ll	talk.’	Christ,	he	was	beginning	to	sound	like	Marty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘O.K.,	Harry.	We’ll	talk.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a><b class="calibre3">17</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">So	far,	it	had	been	an	easy	pregnancy’a	few	days	with	morning	sickness, checkups	perfect,	no	problems.	Ray	kept	driving,	saving	as	much	money	as	he could.	It	felt	increasingly	strange	to	have	his	mother	and	sister	completely outside	his	new	life.	He	wanted	Cait	to	meet	her	and	Molly	and	his	old	friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	also	wanted	to	try	and	find	his	father.	His	father	would	like	Cait,	he	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pressure	built	to	the	level	where	he	had	to	do	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	afraid	to	call.	If	they	were	still	tapping	his	mother’s	line,	they’d	trace	the call.	Even	if	he	flew	to	the	mainland	to	call,	he	wouldn’t	be	able	to	make	any plans.	A	visit	was	the	best	way.	He’d	give	his	mother	a	coded	phone	number	that she	could	use	from	a	pay	phone	if	she	needed	to.	Maybe	they	could	arrange	a vacation	on	the	west	coast	where	she	could	meet	Cait	and	the	baby.	Cait	went along	with	it,	although	she	was	worried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What	if	you’re	caught?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	won’t	get	caught.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">They	had	fun	buying	oversized	sun	glasses	and	a	hat	with	a	large	brim.	He’d always	been	clean	shaven,	so	he	let	his	beard	grow	for	a	few	days.	Stubble	was in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘How	about	a	black	T-shirt	and	a	gold	chain?’	Cait	suggested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Not	good.	I’m	wanted	for	dealing,	remember.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Right.	Bad	idea.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">They	settled	for	a	jogging	outfit	that	he	could	ditch	anywhere’	light	pants, windbreaker,	running	shoes.	‘Like	one	tourist	from	New	York,’	Ray	said	in	the island	way.	‘This	will	work.	It’s	still	cool	there	in	May.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">He	bought	a	round	trip	ticket	to	Pittsburgh.	It	was	a	long	drive	to	Maine,	but	he didn’t	think	that	the	airport	would	be	watched	if	he	were	spotted	and	had	to	run. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	could	get	there	on	back	roads	if	he	had	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>‘What	if	your	mom	isn’t	there?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘She’s	bound	to	be.	Molly’s	graduating	this	year.	They’ll	all	be	there.	Besides, Roland	would	have	told	me	if	there	had	been	any	big	changes,	if	they’d	moved or	anything.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What	will	you	do,	call	when	you	get	there?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	don’t	know.	I	don’t	want	to	chance	the	phone.	Maybe	I’ll	try	to	catch	her	after the	kids	go	to	school	and	Ron’s	at	work.	Wouldn’t	be	much	risk	if	I	just	drove	in, asked	her	to	meet	me	somewhere,	and	left	right	away.’	Cait	put	her	hand	to	her mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘That	would	be	an	awful	shock,’	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Mmm.	I	don’t	know	what	else	to	do.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cait	said.	‘I’m	worried.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘It’s	not	taking	much	of	a	chance	if	I	stay	low	and	don’t	drive	around	too	much in	the	daytime.’	They	put	together	a	traveling	kit.	Ray	took	close-ups	of	Cait	in the	apartment,	making	sure	that	nothing	in	the	background	revealed	their location. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	the	third	week	in	May	when	he	kissed	her	goodbye	at	the	airport.	‘See	you in	a	week.	Take	care	of	yourself.	And	Junior.’	It	was	harder	than	he	thought, leaving	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	be	here.’	He	turned	and	ducked	through	the	metal	detector.	When	he	looked back,	Cait	was	still	standing	there.	He	waved	once	and	went	around	the	corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	walked	to	the	departure	gate	and	sat	near	a	large	Samoan	family. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	on	his	own,	but	he	wasn’t.	It	was	as	though	Cait	were	going	to	show	up any	moment.	He	watched	the	mother	tending	to	her	youngest	children.	A	lot	of work.	She	was	good	at	it.	He	had	more	respect	for	mothers	these	days.	He	wasn’t sure	what	fathers	were	supposed	to	do	with	babies,	but	he	figured	he	could	learn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Samoan	father	was	calm.	Like	that,	maybe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	a	window	seat	on	the	plane.	A	woman	who	looked	like	a	retired	teacher got	up	to	let	him	in	and	then	dove	into	a	book.	He	attached	his	seatbelt	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a>rubbed	his	jaw.	Two	days	without	shaving.	Probably	he	didn’t	look	so	great.	He could	feel	the	woman	ignoring	him.	It	was	good,	really;	the	less	he	talked	on	this trip,	the	better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	plane	climbed,	he	began	to	worry.	For	the	first	time	in	months,	he	felt	the hard	place;	he	put	the	nervousness	away	and	planned	a	route	from	Pittsburgh.	It was	late	in	the	evening	when	he	rented	a	maroon	Ford	and	drove	out	of	the airport.	He	checked	in	at	the	first	cheap	motel	and	went	right	to	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	day,	he	stopped	in	Portsmouth.	He	didn’t	want	to	spend	the	night	in Maine.	He’d	taken	the	slow	way	from	Albany,	through	Vermont.	The	leaves were	out	in	the	valleys	and	just	coming	out	on	the	mountains.	The	greens	were paler	than	in	Hawaii,	deeply	familiar	to	him.	A	couple	of	months	ago	the	woods were	bare	and	the	ground	covered	with	snow,	but	it	was	hard	to	imagine.	In	the north,	you	forget	about	winter	as	fast	as	you	can.	Ray	Jackson,	he	signed	himself in,	effortlessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	up	early	and	on	the	road.	As	he	crossed	over	into	Maine	on	the Piscataqua	River	Bridge,	he	started	becoming	Charley.	He	could	feel	his mother’s	presence	tugging	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stopped	in	her	driveway	at	quarter	to	nine.	The	house	was	quiet,	one	car	in the	garage.	He	walked	quickly	to	the	kitchen	door	and	rapped	on	a	glass	pane. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	mother	appeared,	and	he	saw	her	mouth	say,	‘Charley.’	He	pushed	open	the door	and	put	his	arms	around	her.	She	was	smaller	than	he	remembered.	The smell	of	her	shampoo	was	the	same.	He	had	a	confusion	of	feelings.	She	clung	to him,	crying.	Roles	were	reversed;	he	was	comforting	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stepped	back	and	looked	at	him.	‘You’re	looking	very	well,’	she	said	and wiped	tears	from	her	cheeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	O.K.,	Mom.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	see	that.	I’m	so	happy	to	see	you.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	can’t	stay	too	long.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Oh,	don’t	talk	about	that	now.	Tell	me	about	yourself.	Here,	how	about	a	cup	of coffee?’	She	pulled	out	a	chair.	He	meant	to	set	up	a	meeting	somewhere	else, but	it	was	impossible. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a>‘I	could	use	a	cup.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Charley!’	She	was	looking	at	his	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Oh,	yeah.	I	got	married.	I’m	really	sorry	I	couldn’t	tell	you	about	it.	It’s	one	of the	reasons	I’m	here.’	He	took	the	pictures	of	Cait	from	an	envelope	and	handed them	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘She’s	beautiful!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Cait,’	Charley	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Cait.	I	wish	I	could	have	been	there.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Me,	too.	Well,	nobody	else	was	there,	either.’	He	explained	about	Cait’s	mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘And	there’s	more’you’re	going	to	be	a	grandmother.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘My	goodness.’	Charlotte	sat	down.	‘I	think	I	need	coffee,	too.	When?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Beginning	of	September,	looks	like.’	She	was	speechless.	Charley	got	the coffee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	don’t	know	where	you	live,’	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Hawaii.’	He	gave	her	the	card	with	the	telephone	number.	‘You	have	to	take	1</p>
<p class="calibre1">away	from	each	number’take	1	to	get	Charley	&amp;	Cait.	If	you	call	it	as	it	is,	you get	an	auto	parts	store	in	Winston-Salem.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Molly	has	missed	you	badly.	She	was	pretty	angry	at	you	for	a	year	or	so,	but now	she’s’I	don’t	know’resigned,	I	guess	is	the	word.	She’s	graduating	next month.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	know,’	Charley	said.	He	reached	into	his	pocket	and	put	a	small	box	on	the table.	‘Here’s	a	present	for	her.	Tell	her	I’m	sorry	I	can’t	be	there.’	He	looked	at the	floor	and	then	back	at	his	mother.	‘I	have	to	stay	free.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	already	told	her	that.	Just	like	your	father,	I	said.	He	called,	by	the	way,	after the	blow	up.	I	guess	the	police	tracked	him	down	looking	for	you.	I	told	him what	had	happened.	He	didn’t	say	much.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>‘He	doesn’t	usually,’	Charley	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	could	tell	he	was	worried.	I	said	I’d	let	him	know	if	I	heard	anything.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	want	to	go	see	him.	Is	he	still	in	Minnesota,	up	by	the	border?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yes.	It’s	so	good	to	see	you.	You’re	looking	older.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yeah.	How’s	everyone	else?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Ron’s	fine,	working	hard.	We’ve	got	a	lot	of	expenses	now.	I’ve	got	a	part	time job	at	the	nursery.	It’s	fun	working	with	plants	and	people.	I’ll	call	in,	tell	them	I can’t	make	it	today.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No,	don’t	do	that.	I’m	taking	a	chance	being	here.	I	just	had	to	see	you,	but	I can’t	hang	around.	I	was	hoping	you	could	meet	us	later	on	in	the	fall	or	maybe around	Christmas.	Meet	Cait	and	the	baby.	Maybe	in	Seattle	or	somewhere	on the	west	coast.	I’ve	never	been	in	Seattle.	Maybe	you	could	bring	Molly;	she’s old	enough	to	keep	quiet.	Ron,	too,	but	he	probably	shouldn’t	get	involved.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">His	mother	brightened.	‘I’d	love	to.	We	can	swing	it,	somehow.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	could	call	from	a	pay	phone	sometime;	we	could	get	the	dates	straight then.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	will.	Oh’Harry	George	was	here	a	while	back.	He	said	he	had	a	deal	set	up	for you	that	involved	less	jail	time.	There	was	something	in	it	for	him.	I	don’t	know what.	I	like	to	threw	him	out	of	the	house,	but	I	said	I’d	tell	you	if	I	heard	from you.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Harry	George,’	Charley	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Strange	thing	is,	I	saw	him	just	last	week.	He	said	again	that	you	should	call him.	He	was	in	the	nursery	buying	apple	trees.	Half	a	dozen	Macouns.	Shipped them	to	Vermont,	somewhere.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Maybe	I’ll	call	him.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘He’s	married	now,	has	a	kid,	a	place	over	on	the	foreside.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>Charley	shook	his	head	in	disgust.	‘Harry	George.	What’s	Molly	going	to	do?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘She’s	been	accepted	at	the	University	of	Vermont	at	Burlington.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘She’ll	like	it	up	there,’	Charley	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘We’re	very	excited	for	her.	She	was	all	state	in	basketball	this	year.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No	shit!	All	right,	Molly!’	His	mother	picked	up	Molly’s	present	and	turned	it over	in	her	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Congratulations,	Molly,’	she	read.	‘And	a	drawing	of	a	rose.	What’s	in	it?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Necklace.	Black	coral.	It’s	rare	out	there,	grows	deep.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘She’ll	love	it.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Speaking	of	roses,	I	can’t	send	them	any	more.	I’m	afraid	they’re	going	to	get traced.	But	I’m	hoping	to	see	you	before	your	birthday.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Absolutely.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Charley	finished	his	coffee.	‘Got	to	roll.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Already?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">He	nodded.	She	put	the	phone	number	in	her	pocket.	‘Don’t	let	that	get	away,’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Charley	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	be	careful.	Take	one	for	Charley	and	Cait.	I’ll	call	in	a	couple	of	weeks	from a	pay	phone.’	They	had	a	long	hug	in	the	middle	of	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Take	care	of	yourself,	Charley.	I’m	proud	of	you.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Thanks,	Mom.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">She	followed	him	to	the	car	and	waved	sadly	as	he	drove	away	as	she	waved.	He beeped	twice	at	the	mailbox	and	turned	toward	the	Maine	Mall.	He	drove without	purpose,	upset	and	relieved	at	the	same	time.	She	had	said	just	the	right thing.	Proud	of	him.	He	was	ashamed	of	the	trouble	he’d	given	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a>He	sat	in	the	car	at	the	Mall	parking	lot	for	a	few	minutes	and	then	went	inside	to find	a	bathroom.	On	the	way	out	he	passed	a	phone	and	remembered	Harry George. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Information	gave	him	a	number.	A	woman	answered,	her	voice	faintly	familiar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	might	have	been	the	girlfriend	he’d	met	once’slim,	if	he	remembered,	good looking,	intense,	in	a	quiet	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Harry	around?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘He’s	playing	with	his	new	toy	at	the	boat	yard.	Or	should	be.	He	left	about twenty	minutes	ago.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘O.K.,	thanks.	I’ll	try	and	catch	him	there.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Good	luck.	Who’s	this?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	an	old	friend,’	Charley	said.	‘He’ll	tell	you	all	about	me.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Can’t	wait.’	He	heard	a	small	child	calling	for	her.	‘Whoops,’	she	said,	‘later.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Charley	hung	up	and	walked	to	the	car,	head	down.	He	was	beginning	to	feel that	he’d	been	in	town	too	long,	was	pushing	his	luck.	But	he	needed	to	see Harry.	He	wasn’t	sure	why. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	parked	the	Ford	near	the	boat	yard	and	walked	down	the	hill.	He	didn’t	want Harry	getting	a	look	at	the	license	plate.	The	yard	was	busy.	Boats	suspended	in slings	were	being	lowered	into	the	water.	A	crew	was	adding	to	the	side	of	the marina	building.	No	one	paid	any	attention	to	him,	but	he	felt	exposed,	even with	his	hat	pulled	down	almost	to	his	sun	glasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	found	Harry	near	the	end	of	a	line	of	floats,	sitting	in	the	stern	of	a	white	boat powered	by	large	twin	outboards.	He	stepped	aboard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Hello,	Harry.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What	do	you	know,’	Harry	said.	‘You	could	have	sent	a	check;	you	didn’t	need to	make	a	special	trip.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Fuck	you,	Harry.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>‘Just	kidding.’	Harry	pushed	a	glass	of	juice	away	from	him.	‘You	want	a	beer, juice?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Well,	Charley’you	could	use	a	shave,	but	you’re	looking	good.	Must	have	spent it	wisely.	Forget	about	it.	I	made	it	back.	I	guess	your	mom	told	you	I’ve	got	a good	deal	for	you?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">No	one	else	was	near	them.	Charley	sat	down	carefully,	keeping	his	hat	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Here’s	the	deal:	you	get	caught,	you’re	looking	at	four	to	six	years.	Larsen wants	you	bad.	You’re	like	a	bad	mark	on	his	record.	He’s	big	into	politics	now, on	the	city	council,	likes	to	talk	about	his	effectiveness,	how	he	gets	things	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	trying	to	swing	a	development	permit	on	Commercial	Street,	and	I	need	his backing.	I	told	him	I’d	find	you.	If	you	turn	yourself	in,	he	gets	the	publicity;	I get	the	permit;	and	you	get	twelve	to	fifteen	months’after	time	off	for	good behavior.	There	will	be	a	fine.	I	had	to	pay	ten	grand.	But	that	will	be	taken	care of.	All	you	have	to	do	is	sign	a	statement,	apologize,	and	keep	your	mouth	shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	keep	quiet,	and	there’s	twenty	grand	for	you	when	you	walk	out	the	gate.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Charley	didn’t	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	can	see	where	you’d	be	pissed,’	Harry	said.	‘Doing	hard	time.	I	got	off.	But’a year	would	be	a	whole	lot	better	than	five.	You’d	be	free	of	it,	wouldn’t	have	to stay	on	the	run.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	hear	you	got	married,’	Charley	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yeah.	Twice	the	fun	and	four	times	the	trouble.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Charley	stood	up.	‘See	you,	Harry.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What’	You’re	not	thinking	clearly,	Charley.	My	lawyer	will	handle	everything, Jack	Eagleton,	best	in	the	business.	It’s	all	set	up,	ready	to	go!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	wasn’t	thinking	clearly	when	I	got	mixed	up	with	you	in	the	first	place.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s	eyes	narrowed.	‘I	can	find	you.’	He	made	a	motion	to	get	out	of	his chair.	Charley	had	an	image	of	his	father	stepping	from	behind	a	tree	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>grabbing	a	guy	who	was	robbing	his	traps.	It	was	January.	He’d	thrown	the	guy in	the	creek	and	told	him	he’d	get	worse	next	time.	That	was	the	story	Charley heard.	When	he	asked	his	father	about	it,	his	father	just	nodded	and	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	settled	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Charley	noticed	Harry’s	car	keys	on	the	table.	He	reached	down	and	flipped them	into	the	water.	‘Hate	to	have	you	following	me.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Well,	fuck	you	too.	Why	did	you	come	here,	anyway?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	don’t	know’settle	things,	I	guess.	Close	a	door.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yeah,	well	you’re	getting	the	dumb	prize.	Think	it	over.	If	you	wake	up	smart, call	me.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Charley	left	Harry	sitting	there	and	walked	fast	up	the	hill.	He	looked	back twice;	Harry	wasn’t	following.	When	he	put	his	keys	in	the	Ford	ignition,	he	had a	bad	moment.	What	if	it	didn’t	start’	The	engine	roared	to	life,	and	he	drove away.	It	was	hard	to	stop	looking	in	the	mirror. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	it,	he	thought	and	began	to	breathe	a	little	easier.	Harry	had	a	boat,	sure, and	a	lot	of	other	stuff,	but	he	didn’t	look	too	good.	I’m	the	free	one.	He	slapped the	steering	wheel	a	couple	of	times.	Get	the	hell	out	of	here.	He	passed	the	diner that	Darlene	was	buying	and	had	an	impulse	to	stop.	He	kept	going,	but	when	he came	to	the	Howard	Johnson’s,	he	went	inside	and	called	the	diner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Is	Darlene	there?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Speaking,	Honey.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	thought	it	was	you.	Darlene,	this	is	Charley.	You	come	out	back	in	about	ten minutes,	you’ll	see	a	maroon	Ford.	I’m	on	my	way	out	of	town,	but	it	sure	would be	good	to	see	you.’	She	agreed,	and	he	drove	back	to	the	diner.	He	sat	low	in	the seat	with	his	hat	pulled	down.	She	came	around	from	the	side	door	and	got	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	hugged	hard	and	made	little	noises	that	seemed	to	have	been	trapped	in them	for	years.	She	noticed	his	ring	right	away.	He	told	her	about	Cait	and	the baby.	‘You	look	terrific,’	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	feeling	good.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a>‘Oh	shit!’	Two	state	police	cars	pulled	off	the	road	and	parked	in	front. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘They’re	regulars,’	Darlene	said.	‘They’re	in	most	days	about	now.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	don’t	think	I’ll	stick	around.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	stay	right	here	another	minute;	I’ve	got	something	for	you.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Jesus,	Darlene.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">She	went	back	inside	and	came	right	out	with	a	white	paper	bag.	She	handed	it to	him	through	the	window,	bent	down	and	kissed	him.	‘For	the	trip,’	she	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘wherever	you’re	going.	Darlene’s	famous	muffins.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Thanks,	Darlene.	It’s	great	to	see	you.	Great	to	see	you	looking	happy.’	He started	the	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Bye,	Charley.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Bye.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">He	eased	out	of	the	lot,	his	heart	beating	loudly.	A	mile	down	the	road,	he	turned toward	the	mountains.	As	he	drove	away	from	the	coast,	relief	swept	over	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	tired,	but	he	felt	sure	of	himself.	He	knew	where	he	was	going.	Home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	waited	until	he	got	to	Pittsburgh	to	call	Cait.	The	car	was	returned;	he	was checked	in;	it	was	done.	She	answered	and	that’s	what	he	said:	‘It’s	done.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Oh,	Ray,	I’m	so	glad.	Are	you	all	right?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yep.	I’ll	tell	you	all	about	it	when	I	get	there.	How’s	Junior?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Just	fine.’	Ray,	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a><b class="calibre3">18</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	did	a	slow	burn	as	Charley	walked	out	of	sight.	He	looked	over	the	side	of the	boat.	No	keys.	Pain	in	the	ass.	He	went	over	to	the	marina	pay	phone	to	call Lynn,	who	had	another	set.	It	was	maddening	to	think	of	Charley,	right	there,	so close.	If	he	was	caught,	he’d	have	to	take	the	deal.	Maybe	it	wasn’t	too	late. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	called	the	police	station	and	found	out	that	Roland	was	off	duty.	He	called Roland’s	home	number	and	got	lucky.	‘Roland,	this	is	Harry	George.	Charley Walker’s	in	town.	If	you	get	on	it,	you	might	catch	him.	I	just	saw	him	at	the boat	yard.	I	didn’t	get	a	look	at	his	car.	I	think	he’s	by	himself.	‘</p>
<p class="calibre1">Roland	paused	before	answering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	tell	you	what	I’m	going	to	do,	Harry.	I’m	going	to	try	hard	and	remember some	details	about	a	safe	house	in	Carrabassett,	a	bank	account	in	the	Caymans, a	guy	in	Lewiston	and’where	the	hell	was	it?‘Lowell’	It	isn’t	so	great	getting older,	Harry.	Your	memory	goes.	Sometimes	people	call	me	and	I	forget	all about	it.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Fucking	Charley,’	Harry	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘We’ll	see	you	around,’	Roland	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Right.’	Harry	crashed	the	phone	into	its	cradle.	Goddamnit.	He	picked	up	the telephone	again	to	call	Lynn,	but	his	fingers	pushed	the	numbers	for	Angel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Hello?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Mornin’,	Angel.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Harry!	We	weren’t	going	to	talk	any	more.	Where	are	you?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	couldn’t	help	it,’	he	said.	‘My	fingers	went	crazy.	I’m	at	the	boat	yard.	It’s getting	warm.	Great	day.	You	want	to	come	over’	Take	a	ride	out	to	Jewell’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Check	out	the	boat?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Angel	hesitated.	‘I’m	scared,	Harry.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>‘What,	of	your	Uncle	Marty’	No	way	he’s	going	to	know.	We’ll	just	buzz	out there,	catch	some	rays,	take	it	easy	for	a	while.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Oh,	God,	O.K.	Janie	owes	me	a	shift.	If	she	can’t	do	it,	I’ll	call	in	sick.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Dynamite.	Oh,	Angel,	bring	your	suit.	I’ve	got	a	little	diving	project.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Be	there	in	an	hour.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	walked	to	the	corner	store	at	the	top	of	the	hill	and	bought	a	bottle	of	pre-mixed	pina	coladas,	a	bottle	of	Chardonnay,	ice,	chips,	and	salsa.	He	was	still furious.	How	to	find	Charley’	He	had	a	good	tan;	he	hadn’t	been	in	the	north	all winter,	that’s	for	sure.	Harry	pushed	the	problem	to	the	back	of	his	mind	and cleaned	up	the	boat	while	he	waited	for	Angel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	saw	her	coming	from	a	distance,	walking	tentatively	along	the	line	of	floats, carrying	a	canvas	L.L.	Bean	bag.	She	was	wearing	white	shorts	and	a	caramel colored	T-shirt.	He	waved	and	she	walked	quickly	up	to	the	boat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Welcome	to	the	Jo	Ann,’	he	said,	reaching	for	her	bag.	He	couldn’t	see	much above	her	smile;	she	had	on	a	Red	Sox	hat	and	pricey	sunglasses.	Instead	of giving	him	the	bag,	she	took	his	hand	and	stepped	over	the	rail.	Harry	stared	at her	legs	and	felt	her	weight	as	she	came	all	the	way	aboard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘So,	who’s	Jo	Ann?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Don’t	know’I’m	the	third	owner.	My	father	has	a	fancy	old	boat	named	En Garde.	I	kind	of	like	having	this	little	muscle	job	named	Jo	Ann.	Anyway,	it’s bad	luck	to	change	names.	So,	how	are	you’	You	look	fantastic!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Good.	It’s	a	little	early.	I	worked	last	night.’	Angel	stretched	slowly	and	looked around	the	boat.	‘Not	so	little.’	Harry	had	never	seen	her	bare	legs	before.	They were	trim,	broadening	smoothly	up	into	her	torso.	Her	lower	body	was	all	one piece,	a	torpedo,	a	dolphin,	or	something.	Her	breasts	moved	independently,	had a	more	separate	weight	and	freedom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Big	enough	to	get	around	the	bay.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Well,	I’m	glad	she’s	not	your	wife.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a>‘Who?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Jo	Ann.’	Angel	sat	on	one	of	the	chairs.	‘I	don’t	feel	too	good	about	this.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Hey,	we’re	just	going	for	a	ride.	It’s	too	good	a	day	to	waste.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What’s	the	diving	project?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘My	keys.’	Harry	pointed.	‘Right	about	there.’	Angel	laughed,	kicked	off	her sandals,	and	hung	one	foot	over	the	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Aieee,	it’s	cold.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘We	could	do	it	later.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">She	drew	her	leg	back.	‘Let’s	do	that.	I	want	to	get	out	of	here.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	fired	up	the	engines	and	cast	off.	Away	from	the	marina,	he	told	Angel	to hang	on,	and	he	opened	the	throttles	full	bore.	The	Jo	Ann	roared	and	rose	up	on plane,	accelerating	across	the	tops	of	small	waves,	trailing	a	plume	of	white, shooting	past	a	Casco	Bay	ferry.	The	wind	blew	away	Harry’s	concerns.	Angel stood	beside	him.	‘Wow!’	she	said.	He	could	hardly	hear	her.	He	cut	back,	and the	Jo	Ann	settled	in	the	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘She	moves	right	along,’	he	said.	‘Makes	a	hell	of	a	racket,	though.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Like	a	Harley,’	Angel	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cove	at	Jewell	Island	was	deserted.	Harry	anchored	in	front	of	the	small beach	and	spread	the	canopy	over	the	stern.	They	sipped	pina	coladas	and munched	chips	while	the	Jo	Ann	moved	quietly	up	and	down.	The	tide	was	full. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	thin	cirrus	clouds	floated	high	in	the	sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	got	up	to	get	more	ice.	Angel	tipped	her	head	to	look	at	him	as	he	passed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	eyes	met,	and	he	stopped.	Almond,	honey-colored	eyes.	They	drew	him	in deeper.	Slowly,	without	questioning,	he	bent	toward	her.	When	their	lips	met,	it was	like	the	first	touch	of	water	in	a	slow	motion	dive.	As	his	eyes	closed,	her mouth	opened,	and	he	fell	deeper,	sinking	to	his	knees.	The	deeper	he	went,	the more	he	felt.	Her	hands	went	lightly	to	his	shoulders.	There	was	more	of	her than	there	was	of	him.	There	was	all	of	her	he	wanted.	He	collapsed	against	her</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a>shoulder,	gasping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Angel	took	one	of	his	hands	and	led	it	to	her	breast.	‘Do	something,’	she pleaded.	Her	breast	was	solid	under	the	T-shirt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Wait.’	He	stumbled	below	and	pushed	the	mattress	pads	up	onto	the	deck.	He found	a	pillow	and	pulled	himself	up	the	ladder.	Her	arms	went	around	his	neck as	she	adjusted	her	body	to	his.	His	hands	slid	down	her	back	and	stopped	on	the curve	of	her	ass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Harry?’	He	pushed	her	down	slowly	and	put	his	hand	between	her	legs.	She pressed	against	it	and	reached	for	his	head	with	both	hands.	She	kissed	him	hard, biting	his	lip	once,	breathing	fast	while	he	tried	to	answer	her	lips	and	slide	her shorts	down	over	her	hips.	Her	underwear	came	off	easily.	She	was	wet	and	hot in	his	hand.	He	pushed	off	his	pants.	She	took	her	T-shirt	over	her	head,	and	dug her	nails	into	one	of	his	arms,	pulling	him	onto	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	entered	her	slowly	and	then	deeper.	Again,	she	wanted	more	and	more	of him.	She	made	choking	sounds	and	her	head	rolled	slowly	from	side	to	side.	Her body	went	rigid	and	then	loosened	in	a	long	series	of	catches	and	spasms	and surprised	noises,	falling	through	the	air	like	a	tropical	waterfall,	white	thread, free,	falling	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	she	lay	still	beneath	him.	The	boat	rose	and	fell.	‘Turn	out	the	light,’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Half	an	hour	later,	he	heard	voices.	‘Hey,	it’s	Rocco!	Hey,	ROCCO.’	He	realized that	he	was	naked	on	the	deck,	next	to	Angel,	also	naked,	a	fine	sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Angel?’	He	rubbed	her	shoulder.	‘We’ve	got	company.	You	want	to	scootch down	that	ladder	and	get	dressed?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Ummm,	umm,’	she	said	and	reached	for	her	T-shirt.	Harry	put	his	pants	on	as she	crawled	to	the	ladder	on	hands	and	knees.	He	sat	up	straight,	his	head	above the	rail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Not	Rocco!’	he	yelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Where’s	Rocco’	That’s	his	boat.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>‘No	it	isn’t.	I	bought	it.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	bought	it?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yeah.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Shit.	It	isn’t	Rocco,	guys.	That’s	a	hummer,	the	Jo	Ann.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Sure	is.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘She’ll	get	you	where	you’re	going.’	The	other	boat	turned	away,	and	Harry started	the	engines.	Angel	stayed	below	while	he	pulled	anchor	and	nosed	out	of the	cove	and	around	the	island,	heading	back	across	the	bay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘It’s	safe,’	he	called.	Angel	emerged,	and	they	clung	together.	It	seemed	natural that	there	should	be	no	distance	between	them.	He	kissed	her,	and	as	she responded,	his	knees	weakened	and	his	mind	began	to	swirl.	She	stepped	back with	a	satisfied	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘That’s	a	first,’	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘All	those	orgasms.	I	lost	count	somewhere	around	thirteen.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	were	counting?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘God,	Harry.	We’re	in	deep	shit.’	Harry	managed	to	steer	around	a	buoy.	Angel put	a	warm	arm	around	his	waist.	Their	hips	bumped	and	stayed	together.	She spoke	softly.	‘Nobody	ever	took	me	serious,	before.	Nobody	that	mattered.	I	love you,	Harry.’	Harry’s	tongue	was	welded	to	the	bottom	of	his	mouth.	He	put	his arm	around	her	shoulders	and	squeezed.	‘Do	you	want	your	shirt?’	He	nodded and	adjusted	one	of	the	throttles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	nearly	at	the	marina	when	he	remembered	the	keys.	To	hell	with them.	They	were	probably	sunk	in	the	mud,	anyway.	He	had	another	set	at	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Angel	could	give	him	a	ride	to	his	driveway.	He	didn’t	want	to	bother	about anything;	he	just	wanted	to	keep	touching	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	docked	and	closed	down	the	boat.	Angel	wanted	to	leave	first.	Better	that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a>they	not	be	seen	together.	She	bounced	off	the	Jo	Ann	and	walked	away,	more energetic	than	when	she	had	arrived.	It	was	odd	to	see	her	getting	farther	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	waited	and	then	followed,	getting	quickly	into	her	car	and	slumping	low	in the	seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Angel	drove	up	the	hill	and	paused.	Harry	pointed	to	the	right.	‘I’m	having	a little	trouble	talking,’	he	said.	She	put	her	hand	on	his	leg,	stroking	and reminding.	When	she	reached	his	driveway,	he	got	out	of	the	car	and remembered	the	bag	in	the	back	seat,	the	bottle	of	wine.	Angel	handed	it	to	him through	the	window.	He	didn’t	know	what	to	say.	It	was	all	too	much.	He realized	that	she	was	holding	back	tears.	‘I’ll	see	you	tomorrow’at	T’s,’	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	be	there.’	The	unspoken	for	you	blossomed	in	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Sweet	dreams,’	he	said.	‘Gotta	go.’	Angel	turned	the	car	around	and	drove	off, waving.	Harry	hesitated.	Lynn.	She	wasn’t	two	hundred	yards	away,	probably	in the	kitchen	with	Fergus.	He	was	not	anxious	to	see	her.	If	he’d	had	his	car,	he probably	would	have	gone	for	a	drive,	called	in,	and	come	back	late.	Fucking Charley.	He	walked	slowly	through	the	trees	toward	the	house.	The	trimmers	had done	a	good	job;	it	would	be	four	or	five	years	before	the	drive	would	begin	to be	crowded.	If	you	cut	too	much,	it	looks	like	a	subdivision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	walked	into	the	kitchen	like	a	condemned	man.	Fergus	looked	up	brightly and	hammered	a	spoon	on	his	tray.	‘That’s	my	boy!’	Harry	said.	‘You	wouldn’t believe	what	happened	today,	Hon.	Charley	Walker	showed	up.	Basically,	he told	me	to	fuck	off.	No	deal.	Then	he	tossed	my	keys	over	the	side	and	took	off.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lynn	looked	at	him	and	looked	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	think	he	called	this	morning.	Someone	was	trying	to	find	you.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Well,	he	did.	Son	of	a	bitch.	I	was	so	pissed,	I	went	out	to	Jewell	Island	and drank	pina	coladas	all	afternoon.	Oh,	here.’	He	put	the	bag	on	the	counter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Chardonnay.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	made	a	lasagne.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Thank	God.	A	man	can’t	live	on	chips.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	make	a	salad.	We	can	eat	any	time.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>‘I’ll	just	take	a	shower.	My	man!’	He	patted	Fergus	on	the	head	and	tried	not	to run	out	of	the	kitchen.	He	might	as	well	have	been	wearing	Angel	Carrera’that’s how	he	felt’her	arms	around	his	neck,	legs	wrapped	around	his	waist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	shower	calmed	him	down.	He	changed	clothes	and	stretched	out	on	the	bed for	a	minute,	letting	the	house	reclaim	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Conversation	at	dinner	was	strained,	but	he	got	through	it.	By	the	time	he	went to	bed,	a	distance	had	established	itself	between	them.	Lynn	read,	as	always,	but there	were	no	small	pats	or	rubs.	Let	it	be,	was	the	unvoiced	directive	hanging above	them.	Let	it	be.	He	gave	up	for	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a><b class="calibre3">19</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	long	flight	gave	Ray	plenty	of	time	to	think	things	over.	Too	bad	he	hadn’t seen	Molly	and	Roland	and	a	couple	of	the	guys,	but	it	was	a	good	trip.	He	felt better	about	the	future.	A	get	together	in	the	fall	would	be	fine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	come	a	long	way	since	he	first	flew	to	Honolulu	from	San	Francisco	with no	idea	what	to	expect.	Ray	Jackson,	that	had	been	a	piece	of	luck.	Bob	Wu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lucky	Ray.	Archer,	Jim	Pizza.	Cait.	Everything	had	changed	when	he	met	Cait. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	waiting	in	the	same	spot	where	she	had	waved	goodbye.	It	was	better than	good	to	see	her,	tall	and	straight,	smiling,	her	cheeks	flushed	from pregnancy.	They	had	a	long	hug	and	then	began	to	catch	up,	spending	extra	for	a cab	home.	Ray	told	her	about	his	mother	and	about	Harry.	Cait	had	worked	extra shifts	and	made	money.	She’d	begun	going	to	a	yoga	class	for	pregnant	mothers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	went	up	to	the	apartment	and	directly	to	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	hours	later,	sitting	at	the	table	and	eating	grilled	ahi,	the	trip	seemed	like	a receding	dream.	Cait	was	limiting	herself	to	one	glass	of	wine.	Ray	poured himself	more.	‘Three	for	me,	one	for	you,’	he	said.	‘I	like	this	pregnancy	stuff.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	can’t	tell	you,’	Cait	said,	‘now	you’re	home,	I	feel	so	much	better.	A	couple	of times	I	thought	you	might	get	caught,	and	I	couldn’t	breathe.	Five	years?’	Her face	went	blank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No	way,’	Ray	said.	‘No	way.	I’m	back	now.	And	we’ll	see	Mom	after	the	baby’s born,	maybe	just	before	Christmas.	Where	should	we	go,	Seattle’	San Francisco?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cait	was	silent.	She	took	a	deep	breath.	‘Do	you	think	we	should	take	Harry’s deal?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	in	Ray’s	mind	went	dark.	‘What?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Take	the	offer.	Oh,	Ray,	it	would	be	terrible,	very	hard,	but	it	would	be	hard	for both	of	us’worse	for	you,	I	know.	But	we	could	do	twelve	or	even	fifteen months.	I	know	we	could.	But	five	years?’	Ray	had	trouble	swallowing	his mouthful	of	fish.	‘Maybe	it	would	be	better	to	get	it	over	with.	The	baby	could</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a>have	your	real	name.	We	wouldn’t	have	to	live	our	whole	lives	worrying	about getting	caught.’	Ray	saw	a	group	of	men	in	orange	prison	clothes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	was	thinking	about	a	fake	suicide,’	he	said.	‘I	know	just	the	place	in	San Francisco.	I	could	leave	my	clothes	and	a	note.	I’ve	still	got	my	old	driver’s license.	I	could	leave	a	wallet	with	that	and	a	few	bucks	inside.	I	guess	it wouldn’t	be	the	first	time	somebody	tried	that.	But	it	might	help.	After	a	few years,	they	might	give	up,	close	the	books	on	me.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘They	might,’	Cait	said.	‘Honey,	I’m	with	you	either	way.	If	no	can,	no	can.’	Ray looked	out	the	window.	A	bit	of	the	Ala	Wai	canal	was	visible	past	the	edge	of the	building	across	the	street.	‘I	could	get	a	divorce,’	she	said,	‘and	we	could	get married	again	as	soon	as	you	get	out.	Cait	Walker.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘How	would	you	live?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘We’ve	got	some	saved.	I	can	work	for	another	four	or	five	months.	Daddy would	help.	Food	stamps.’	The	walls	began	closing	in	on	him.	He	got	up	from his	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ve	got	to	go	out	for	awhile.’	He	shook	his	head	negatively	and	said	no	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘O.K.,	Honey.’	Cait	didn’t	move	as	he	walked	out	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a><b class="calibre3">20</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	continued	to	see	Angel	at	T’s.	He	couldn’t	help	himself.	They	planned another	meeting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	week	later,	he	was	watching	a	Red	Sox	game	at	home	when	the	phone	rang. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Harry’	This	is	Charley.	I’ll	take	the	deal.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yo!	You	woke	up	smart.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Cait	did.’	Something	good	was	happening!	About	time.	‘I	wouldn’t	do	this	on my	own,’	Charley	said.	‘But	there’s	three	of	us	to	think	about.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Wait	a	second,’	Harry	said,	‘I’ll	give	you	Jack	Eagleton’s	number.	I’ll	let	him know	you’re	going	to	call.	He’ll	take	care	of	everything.	Hang	on?’	He	found	the number	and	rushed	back.	‘Charley?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yep.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Here	it	is.	I’ll	tell	him	you’re	going	to	call	later	or	maybe	tomorrow.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Listen,	Harry:	Cait	and	I	talked	this	over.	We	don’t	want	your	money.	The fine’O.K.	You	can	pay	the	fine	and	the	legal	expenses.	The	whole	thing’s	an investment	for	you	anyway.	But	the	shut	up	money’we	don’t	want	it.	It	would	be like	I	was	working	for	you.	I’ll	take	the	deal,	but,	if	I	get	more	than	eighteen months,	the	whole	world	is	going	to	know	how	Harry	George	got	started.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘No	problem,’	Harry	said.	‘Don’t	worry	about	it.	Jack	has	it	all	set	up.	You’ll	be out	in	twelve	or	thirteen	months	with	good	behavior;	Larsen	gets	his	good	press, guardian	of	the	community;	I	get	my	permit.	Everybody	wins.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	worry	about	whatever	I	want	to,	Harry.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘There’s	the	Charley	we	know	and	love.’	He	read	out	Eagleton’s	phone	number. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Where	are	you?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	call	him	this	afternoon,’	Charley	said	and	hung	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a>Harry	got	right	on	it.	Jack	was	out	of	his	office,	but	Marianne	took	the	message. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marianne	was	an	elegant	piece	of	work.	Too	old	for	him,	he	thought,	but	he wouldn’t	mind.	There	was	something	amused	behind	her	impeccable	manners. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	was	losing	his	way,	sexually.	He	couldn’t	imagine	sitting	down	to	dinner with	Angel	for	the	rest	of	his	life,	but	neither	could	he	picture	lying	next	to	Lynn every	night.	When	he	was	fourteen,	he	used	to	listen	to	Dylan	albums. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	is	happening	here,	but	you	don’t	know	what	it	IISSS,	DO	YOU,	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JOOONES’	The	heavy	beat	repeated	in	his	mind	like	a	lunatic	pounding	a	bass drum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	left	a	message	for	Larsen	and	drove	to	the	boat	yard.	He	was	beginning	to understand	why	his	father	spent	so	much	time	on	the	En	Garde.	The	Jo	Ann	was a	small	boat,	but	it	was	his.	He	could	think	there,	or	not	think,	without distraction.	It	was	fine,	early	in	the	morning,	to	have	a	cup	of	coffee	on	board and	read	the	paper.	A	few	times,	he’d	gone	out	after	dinner	and	just	drifted	in	the dusk,	watching	the	city	lights	come	to	life.	He	thought	of	taking	Lynn	and Fergus	some	evening,	but	he	couldn’t.	Angel	was	already	aboard.	It	would	have been	a	breach	of	trust,	an	infidelity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	stretched	his	legs	in	front	of	the	deck	chair.	There	was	an	unfamiliar feeling	in	the	pit	of	his	stomach.	For	the	first	time	that	he	could	remember,	he was	scared.	His	father	was	still	south,	in	the	Bahama’s	at	last	word,	showing	no signs	of	remorse	for	having	left	Wall	Street.	If	he	were	sitting	next	to	him holding	a	glass	of	Laphroiag,	Harry	would	have	said	something	about	being scared.	For	better	or	worse,	his	father	would	have	had	an	opinion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry’s	mind	told	him	to	get	to	work,	to	keep	the	pressure	on	Larsen	to	bring	the permits	to	a	vote,	and	to	talk	further	with	the	Save	The	Harbor	group.	He	would have	to	pay	for	another	option	soon	if	the	permits	were	delayed	much	longer, have	to	hit	Mort	up	for	a	second	short-term	loan.	Beneath	these	concerns, another	need	was	building’to	hold	Angel,	to	go	down	to	that	place	where	he	was altogether	wanted	and	used,	where	they	were	joined.	If	he	were	living	in	a cartoon,	she	would	be	the	banana	peel	that	put	his	feet	higher	than	his	head.	But the	fall	was	into	Angel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	gave	up	and	went	to	T’s.	Angel	was	happy	to	see	him.	She	was	wearing	a tight	aqua	blouse,	showing	more	cleavage	than	usual.	‘My	banana	peel,’	Harry said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>‘Huh?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘	You	turn	me	upside	down.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Angel	blushed	and	moved	close.	‘I’d	like	to.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Tomorrow?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">She	made	a	sad	face.	‘I	have	to	work	at	eleven.	I’m	off	on	Thursday.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Thursday,	then,’	Harry	said.	‘Great!	Thursday.’	He	was	smiling	broadly.	Elation banished	fear.	He	had	a	quick	drink,	went	home,	paid	special	attention	to	Fergus, and	talked	with	Lynn	about	the	possible	addition	of	a	sun	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	following	day,	just	before	noon,	he	called	Jack	Eagleton.	Charley	had reported	in	and	hadn’t	changed	his	mind.	‘Walker	was	cooperative,’	Jack	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘He	will	be	arraigned	a	week	from	Wednesday.	He’ll	need	bail,	of	course.	I’m assuming	that	you	want	the	firm	to	take	care	of	it?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Correct.	We	don’t	want	the	world	knowing	that	I’m	covering	his	bail.	When	is the	hearing?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	don’t	have	a	firm	date,	yet.	We	need	to	go	before	Judge	Darter.	It	looks	like the	latter	part	of	July.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Excellent!	Send	me	a	bill.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	try	to	remember,’	Jack	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	was	about	to	hang	up,	when	he	had	a	thought.	‘Hey	Jack,	you	want	to come	out	on	the	bay	sometime’	Check	out	my	boat?’	There	was	a	longish	pause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Jack?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	was	reminding	myself	that	you	are	an	adult	now;	there	is	every	possibility	that you	can	read	a	compass.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Very	funny,	Jack.	We’ll	pick	an	extra	calm	day,	no	fog,	geriatric	seas.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	look	forward	to	it,’	Jack	said	calmly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	found	Larsen	in	his	office.	Larsen	beamed	when	he	heard	the	news.	‘A</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>good	day	for	the	community,’	he	said.	What	a	turkey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘He’s	coming	in	next	Wednesday.	Probably	the	Advertiser	ought	to	know.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Definitely.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘He’s	going	to	cooperate	fully.	Should	be	some	good	press:	the	relentless pressure	of	law	enforcement,	led	by	Police	Chief	Larsen.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Right.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Now	about	those	condos.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Meeting	is	on	Thursday,’	Larsen	said.	‘We’ll	see	what	happens.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Thursday,	shit.	I	forgot.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	should	be	there.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	be	there.’	It	meant	a	shorter	time	with	Angel,	that’s	all.	‘Seven	o’clock’I’ll be	there.’	Harry	walked	down	to	T’s	in	a	good	mood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Day	after	tomorrow,’	he	promised	Angel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	Thursday,	he	woke	to	a	pouring	rain.	He	went	to	a	meeting	with	Mort	and then	drove	to	the	boat	yard	and	waited	for	Angel.	She	showed	up	at	eleven, water	pouring	down	her	yellow	slicker,	eyes	bright.	She	turned	around	once	in the	crowded	space	below	decks	and	took	off	the	dripping	slicker.	‘I’m	making everything	all	wet.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	hung	it	by	the	ladder.	‘Don’t	worry	about	it;	it’s	a	boat.’	She	threw	her arms	around	him.	Her	warm	luxurious	body	was	like	a	reward	for	living.	It’s	all worth	it,	he	thought	as	his	list	of	things	to	do	slipped	away.	‘What’s	that perfume?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	like	it?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Mmmm.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Something	I	bought	at	the	Mall.’	He	brought	his	hands	up	under	the	light sweatshirt	she	was	wearing.	‘I	missed	you,’	she	said,	half	closing	her	eyes.	Harry</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>ran	out	of	words.	He’d	been	waiting	ten	days	for	her.	He	had	to	be	inside	her, claiming	and	claimed.	It	was	a	quick	happy	fuck	on	a	narrow	berth,	her	broad smile,	his	gasping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	half	crawled	to	the	other	berth	and	collapsed.	‘Now	what	do	we	do?’	he asked,	laughing.	Rain	drummed	on	the	deck,	streamed	down	the	porthole. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘We	could	do	it	again,’	Angel	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Mmm,	later.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Harry?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yes?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	love	it	here.	It’s	small,	but	it’s	so	cozy.	I’m	hungry.	Are	you	hungry?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘A	little.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	didn’t	have	any	breakfast.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Hang	on,	I’ll	whip	up	some	eggs	Benedict.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Oooh!	Classy!	I’ll	have	chilled	cantaloupe	first.	I	like	cantaloupe	first.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘So	do	I,’	Harry	remembered.	‘Now	I’m	hungry.	Let’s	go	get	something.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Oh,	goodie.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘But,	could	we	just	lie	here	for	a	few	minutes,	listen	to	the	rain?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Five	minutes,’	Angel	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	breathed	out	and	closed	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Time’s	up.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Urgh,	umm’O.K.,	here	we	go.’	They	dressed	and	drove	to	Cole	Farms	in	Gray where	they	weren’t	likely	to	meet	anyone	they	knew.	They	ate	and	talked	about going	to	a	movie,	but	Angel	was	nervous	about	being	seen	together.	She	wanted to	show	Harry	her	apartment,	so	Harry	followed	her	car	into	the	West	End.	They</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a>parked	two	blocks	away	and	walked	to	her	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	swear,’	she	said,	‘the	next	place	I	get	is	going	to	have	parking.	This	is	such	a pain,	sometimes.	Especially	on	snow	days.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	apartment	was	small	and	surprisingly	neat.	Harry	had	expected	a	messy place,	fertile	with	cast	off	blouses	and	half	read	magazines.	Angel	was	nervous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	like	it	here,’	Harry	said.	‘What’s	the	matter?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘That	guy	in	the	door	of	the	laundromat’I	think	he’s	a	friend	of	Uncle	Marty’s.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yeah?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	scared,	Harry.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	took	her	in	his	arms.	‘To	hell	with	him,’	he	said.	‘What’s	he	going	to	do?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	don’t	want	to	know.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ll	worry	about	it.	You	have	any	music?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Let’s	see?’	They	discovered	her	bed	and	had	a	quiet	afternoon.	Angel	was sexually	deliberate,	tender	and	thorough.	Harry	lost	track	of	time,	rocking	and rocking,	plunging	and	rocking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	slept	and	almost	missed	the	city	council	meeting.	He	made	a	hurried	call	to Lynn	on	the	way,	apologizing	for	missing	dinner.	‘I	got	into	it	at	T’s,’	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	said	something	about	having	to	talk,	and	he	agreed.	He	just	made	it	as Larsen	called	the	meeting	to	order. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	council	worked	through	a	long	series	of	disagreements.	At	ten	o’clock, Larsen	closed	the	meeting.	The	permits	hadn’t	even	been	mentioned.	Harry	was furious.	He	caught	up	to	Larsen	outside	and	asked	what	had	happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Couple	of	the	members	said	they	might	be	late,	so	I	scheduled	it	last.	Couldn’t get	to	it.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Jesus,’	Harry	said.	‘It’s	going	to	cost	me.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Next	month	for	sure.	Guaranteed.	First	order	of	business.’	Larsen	slapped	him</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a>on	the	back	encouragingly.	‘Hey,	Tony!’	He	turned	to	talk	to	Tony	Carvalho. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Goddamnit!	What	a	pain	in	the	ass.	He	was	going	to	have	to	see	Orin	Borders about	the	wharf	option.	Get	more	money	from	Mort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	started	toward	home,	changed	his	mind,	and	parked	in	front	of	T’s.	He	was O.K.	about	being	evasive;	he	was	all	right	with	keeping	things	from	people;	but he	rarely,	if	ever,	told	an	outright	lie.	He	had	lied	to	Lynn.	Having	a	drink	at	T’s would	make	his	excuse	a	little	bit	true,	or,	at	least,	more	believable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	late	crowd	was	different’the	losers	and	the	lost,	a	few	newcomers	who	could go	either	way,	no	Angel,	a	bartender	waiting	on	the	clock.	Harry	tossed	down	a Scotch.	I	can	have	another	one,	or	I	can	go	home,	he	thought.	Not	a	terrific choice.	He	went	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lynn	was	asleep	and	made	no	effort	to	wake	up	when	he	crawled	into	bed.	He was	grateful	and	felt	that	he’d	gotten	away	with	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	morning,	when	he	came	down	for	breakfast,	Lynn	told	him	calmly	that	she was	taking	Fergus	to	visit	with	her	father	for	a	few	days,	maybe	a	week.	‘I	need some	space,’	she	said.	She	was	already	packed.	Harry	barely	had	time	to	say goodbye	to	Fergus	before	she	picked	him	up	and	carried	him	to	her	car.	Harry waved	from	the	doorstep,	still	in	his	bathrobe.	Lynn	looked	different,	distant, almost	like	a	stranger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	surprised	and	troubled.	Also,	relieved.	Whatever	was	happening,	he didn’t	have	to	deal	with	it	for	a	couple	of	days.	A	good	thing.	He	had	a	lot	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	went	back	in	the	house	and	took	a	shower.	First	thing	to	do	was	to	call	Mort, then	find	Orin	Borders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mort	said	that	he	could	come	up	with	half	the	option	money.	Harry	had	just enough	for	the	rest.	He	took	his	checkbook	to	Orin’s	office	and	waited	nearly	an hour	for	him	to	finish	a	meeting.	When	he	was	finally	alone	with	Orin,	he	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Hate	to	do	it,	old	buddy,	but	I’ve	got	to	give	you	some	more	cash.	The	permits are	looking	good,	but	they	were	delayed	again	in	the	council.	I	only	need	another three	months,	but	I’ll	pay	you	for	six.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Orin	leaned	back	in	his	chair,	the	harbor	visible	behind	him.	‘Can’t	do	it,	Harry.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What’	What	do	you	mean’	You	need	more	bucks’	I’ve	made	you	rich	already. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	much	do	you	want?’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a>‘Said	I	can’t	do	it.’	Harry	stared	at	him.	‘I	sold	a	year	option,	beginning	the	first of	the	month.’	Harry	couldn’t	believe	what	he	was	hearing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Who?’	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Not	supposed	to	say,	but	you’re	going	to	find	out	anyway’Empire	Construction, out	of	Albany,	New	York.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Albany’	Guy	named	Sal?’	Orin	shrugged.	A	yes	shrug.	‘Thanks	a	hell	of	a	lot, Orin.	What	have	I	got’	Five	fucking	days?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Midnight,	the	thirty-first,’	Orin	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Son	of	a	bitch.’	Harry	stormed	out.	Now	what’	Larsen.	Fucking	Larsen	had	been squirrelly	after	the	meeting.	Maybe	he’d	been	gotten	to,	bought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	picked	it	up	a	notch.	He	couldn’t	waste	time	pissing	and	moaning;	he needed	five	million	dollars	by	Wednesday.	He	drove	directly	to	his	mother’s	and explained	the	situation.	She	heard	him	out	and	said,	‘Harry,	over	the	years	I	have never	bailed	your	father	out	of	his	business	affairs.	It	has	proven	wise,	and	I	am going	to	follow	the	same	course	with	you.’	Harry	sat,	stunned.	‘In	addition,’	she said,	‘I	have	just	recently	committed	a	sizeable	sum	to	a	trust	for	Fergus.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Fergus!	Why	don’t	you	let	me	triple	the	money	and	then	give	it	to	Fergus?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	sorry	to	disappoint	you,	Dear.	You	will	learn	more	from	your	mistakes	than from	my	largesse.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Oh,	finely	put,	Mother!	Finely	put.’	He	made	a	strangled	sound.	‘There’s	a	word for	you	in	P-Portuguese.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Don’t	sputter,	Harry.	One	must	do	what	one	thinks	best.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	think	it	best	I	leave,’	Harry	said,	getting	to	his	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	am	sorry	for	your	troubles,’	she	said.	He	remembered	Fergus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Thanks	for	thinking	of	Fergus.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘He’s	a	very	special	little	boy,’	she	said.	‘Where	are	you	going’	Won’t	you	stay</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a>for	tea?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘There’s	some	cleaning	to	do	on	the	front	deck	of	the	Titanic;	I’m	going	to	get right	at	it.’	He	thought	he	saw	the	corner	of	her	mouth	twitch,	but	he	didn’t	stick around	to	verify.	Jesus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marty	was	the	last	hope.	He	got	him	on	the	phone	and	asked	for	a	meeting.	‘You know	our	deal’it’s	a	gold	mine,	right’	Well,	I	have	a	cash	flow	situation.	I	think we	can	work	something	out	that	will	make	us	both	healthier.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yeah,’	Marty	said.	‘I’m	tied	up	all	day.	I	got	a	dinner	meeting	in	Camden.	How about	Moody’s,	around	nine?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Good	deal.	I’ll	see	you	at	Moody’s,	nine	tonight.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	went	over	to	T’s	to	say	hello	to	Angel	and	tell	her	that	Lynn	was	gone	for a	few	days.	Angel	wasn’t	there.	He	didn’t	feel	like	going	home,	so	he	drove	out to	the	boat	and	took	a	nap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	nine,	he	was	sitting	at	the	counter	at	Moody’s	finishing	a	piece	of	apple	pie when	someone	tapped	him	on	the	shoulder.	‘Harry	George,	right?’	Harry nodded.	The	guy	put	a	twenty	dollar	bill	on	the	counter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Marty	says,	pay	for	your	dinner,	tell	you	come	outside	where	it’s	cool.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Big	tip,’	Harry	said.	The	guy	turned	and	went	out	the	door.	Harry	took	another bite	and	swallowed	some	coffee.	Edith’s	lucky	day,	he	thought.	He	smiled	at	the waitress,	who	had	been	there	as	long	as	he	could	remember,	and	walked	around to	the	side	parking	lot.	It	was	almost	dark.	The	guy	waved	from	the	far	corner	of the	lot.	He	was	standing	by	a	black	car.	Harry	walked	over	and	bent	toward	the car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	first	blow	exploded	squarely	on	his	mouth,	knocking	him	back	against another	car.	He	straightened	and	coughed	out	blood.	He	brought	his	hand	to	his mouth	and	spit	out	a	tooth.	He	held	it	out	to	the	guy.	‘Here’give	this	to Marty’proof’maybe	he’ll	give	you	a	bonus.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guy	took	the	tooth	in	his	right	hand.	His	right	elbow	twitched,	and	a	left hook	out	of	nowhere	broke	Harry’s	nose,	spinning	him	sideways.	He	dropped	to his	hands	and	knees,	on	the	edge	of	consciousness.	Slowly,	he	pulled	himself	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a>his	feet.	His	legs	were	loose,	wobbly.	Blood	was	streaming	down	his	face.	He swallowed	and	looked	directly	at	the	guy.	His	father’s	words	came	back	to	him in	slow	motion,	‘Sometimes,	sometimes	you	gotta	take	a	beating	and	move	on	?’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a><b class="calibre3">21</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Honolulu	was	bustling	with	summer	visitors.	Construction	was	booming.	Ray and	Cait	made	the	most	of	the	seven	weeks	they	had	before	the	sentencing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	it	came	time	to	part	at	the	airport,	there	was	nothing	left	for	Ray	to	say but’I	love	you.	I’m	sorry.	Aloha.	He	bent	down	and	rubbed	goodbye	on	Cait’s belly.	They	shared	a	long	look.	He	backed	up	two	steps,	one	hand	raised.	Cait raised	her	hand	in	answer,	smiling	sadly.	He	turned	and	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	numb	for	hours	as	the	red-eye	crossed	the	Pacific,	but	an	edge	of	relief crept	in	with	the	early	dawn.	At	least	he	was	on	his	way,	getting	it	over	with.	By the	time	he	reached	Maine,	he	was	resigned,	almost	cheerful,	determined	to	stay positive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	went	straight	to	Eagleton’s	office	in	Portland.	The	hearing	was	the	next	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eagleton	was	calm	and	matter	of	fact	about	the	sentence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘It	is	the	judge’s	discretion,’	he	said.	‘Given	the	circumstances,	we	can	expect sixteen	months	or	less.’	His	eyebrows	lifted	when	he	said	‘circumstances.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eagleton	was	right.	Charley	was	sentenced	to	fifteen	months	in	Thomaston.	The court	accepted	his	apology	and	restitution	in	the	amount	of	fifteen	thousand dollars.	Charley	was	led	away	and	driven	upstate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘It	was	as	good	as	we	could	have	hoped,’	he	wrote	to	Cait.	‘I	should	be	out	for the	baby’s	first	birthday.	The	worst	thing	was	seeing	my	mom	crying	in	the courthouse.	I’m	glad	you	stayed	in	Honolulu.	It’s	better	to	remember	you	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	we	saved	a	bundle.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">She	wrote	back,	‘Dear	Charley,	I’m	going	to	get	used	to	Charley,	starting	now.	I love	you,	Charley.	I	love	you,	Charley.	The	baby	is	kicking.	I’m	going	to	work for	at	least	two	more	weeks.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	write	every	day,	but	three	or	four	times	a	week	Charley	got	a	letter, bringing	him	up	to	date.	He	wrote	back	often,	always	signing,	‘Charley’</p>
<p class="calibre1">followed	by	the	number	of	days	until	he	got	out.	‘Charley	365’	was	a	memorable day. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a>It	was	bad	inside,	but	it	was	bearable.	There	was	a	small	gym	where	he	got	to play	hoops	once	in	awhile.	He	worked	most	days	in	the	woodshop,	making jewelry	boxes	and	miniature	lobster	crates	for	sale	to	tourists.	It	was	better	than sitting	around	watching	TV. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	got	lucky	with	his	cell	mate,	Ray.	‘Strange,	huh,’	he	wrote	Cait.	‘Ray.	Ray Naki.	He’s	Indian,	Native	American.	I	don’t	know	his	Indian	name;	that’s private.	Funny	thing	is’I	played	football	against	him	in	high	school	a	couple	of games.	We	put	two	guys	on	him,	and	he	was	still	chasing	me	around	half	the time.	Couple	of	times	I	couldn’t	get	out	of	the	way.	It	was	like	having	a	barn door	fall	on	you.	We	got	a	laugh	out	of	that.	He’s	good	to	be	around’quiet.	That’s key	around	here.	Keep	your	mouth	shut.	You’d	never	know	it	from	the	outside, but	there’s	an	inner	courtyard.	Ray’s	in	charge	of	a	garden	there,	and	he’s	got	it full	of	flowers,	really	nice.	Nobody	gives	him	any	shit	about	growing	flowers.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">On	September	20th,	he	got	a	note	from	Cait	that	said	only:	‘Baby	Girl!	Kalani.	7</p>
<p class="calibre1">lbs,	1	oz.	She’s	beautiful!	I	love	you.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">He	told	Ray.	‘Good,’	Ray	said.	That	was	like	a	song	and	dance	from	someone else.	‘Good,’	Charley	repeated,	nodding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cait	was	with	her	father	in	Green	Bay.	She	was	planning	to	bring	the	baby	for	a visit	when	she	left	Green	Bay,	taking	a	roundabout	way	back	to	Hawaii.	Her father	wanted	her	to	stay	in	Wisconsin	until	Charley	got	out,	but	she	was	anxious to	get	back	to	her	own	life.	She	told	Charley	that	her	father	understood.	‘Kalani has	your	eyes,’	she	told	him.	‘Maybe	she	takes	a	bit	more	after	your	side	of	the family.	She’s	fairly	quiet,	spends	a	lot	of	time	looking	at	things.	Really,	I	think she’s	more	like	herself	than	anyone	else.	My	father	will	miss	her.	So	will	Jenna. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jenna’s	been	helpful.	She	loves	Kalani,	and	I	think	she’s	mostly	forgiven	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	a	relief.	It’s	nice	for	Kalani	to	have	Aunt	Jenna.	Soon	she’ll	meet	Aunt Molly	and	Grandma!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Charley	didn’t	brag	about	Kalani.	A	lot	of	the	guys	weren’t	going	to	appreciate happy	talk	from	someone	with	things	to	look	forward	to	in	less	than	a	year.	He kept	his	head	down.	He	knew	a	couple	of	the	other	prisoners	and	one	of	the guards.	Word	got	around	that	he	was	O.K.	There	were	a	few	guards	that	got	off on	giving	people	shit,	needling	them,	seeing	if	they	could	get	them	to	lose	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	they	started	in	on	him,	the	hard	place	came	up	and	said,	‘328’	or	‘316.’	He took	it,	silently.	‘It’s	a	wonder	anybody	ever	gets	out,’	he	wrote	to	Cait.	‘It	would</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a>be	so	easy	to	teach	one	of	these	guys	a	lesson.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">On	a	gray	day	in	November,	Cait	put	Kalani	in	his	arms,	and	he	forgot	for	a moment	that	he	was	in	jail.	She	looked	up	at	him,	wondering	who	he	was.	She made	a	gurgling	sound,	and	he	felt	suddenly	connected’his	little	girl!	‘Too much!’	he	said	to	Cait.	‘She’s	got	your	mouth.	Did	you	know	that’	Your	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	reminds	me	a	little	of	my	father,	too.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	have	your	father’s	address.	Your	mom	gave	it	to	me.	Do	you	think	I	should write?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘For	sure.	Send	a	picture.	I	should	write,	too.	I’ve	been	too	embarrassed.	We’ll go	visit.	What	do	you	say,	Kalani,	we’ll	go	see	your	grandpa!’	This	was	fine	with Kalani.	‘I	can’t	believe	how	glad	I	am	to	see	you,’	he	said	to	Cait.	‘You	look tired,	Baby.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	am.	Your	mom	has	been	great.	But	I	need	to	be	home.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	wish	I	could	help.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	are,	Honey.	You’re	doing	the	best	thing	you	could	be	doing	for	us.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">That	night	Charley	lay	awake	for	a	long	time.	Cait	and	Kalani.	They	smelled	like outside.	He	ached	to	be	with	them.	All	winter,	all	summer	to	go.	Cait	was	right about	the	five	years.	He	couldn’t	even	imagine	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	day	he	was	in	a	bad	mood.	One	of	the	guards	sensed	it	and	told	him	to hurry	up	in	line.	‘Move	it,	Walker!’	Charley	looked	up	slowly	and	gathered	his feet	under	him.	‘306.’	‘306.’	He	took	a	deep	breath	and	shook	his	head	at	the guard.	Not	this	time,	Buddy.	He	walked	quickly	ahead.	One	more	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	low	for	a	week.	But	as	the	images	of	Cait	and	Kalani	softened	and	lost their	immediacy,	he	settled	into	the	routine.	Cait	wrote	steadily	from	Honolulu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	divorce	came	through.	Christmas	was	miserable,	but,	slowly,	the	nights	got shorter,	the	days	longer.	Cait	sent	him	a	drawing	of	a	horse	and	rider	climbing	a switchback	trail.	He	remembered	the	scene.	They	had	been	on	a	trip	to	the	Big Island,	hiking	in	Pololu	Valley.	The	horse	and	rider	had	passed	them,	powerful and	surprisingly	fast.	He	remembered	her	talking	about	the	combination,	horse and	rider,	passion	and	purpose,	stronger	as	a	unit	than	they	were	separately.	‘I wanted	to	do	a	sculpture,’	she	wrote,	‘but	it	would	have	had	to	be	ten	feet	high.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a>Charley	sent	her	a	drawing	of	Ray	Naki	sitting	on	his	bunk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	by	one,	the	days	went	by.	Spring	came.	Ray’s	flowers	began	to	bloom.	He was	in	the	courtyard	on	a	warm	afternoon	when	one	of	the	newer	prisoners	came up	to	him.	‘You’re	the	guy	doing	time	for	Harry	George,	right?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Well,	sort	of.	Charley	Walker.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Mike	Brannigan.	Thought	you	might	like	to	know’he	ain’t	as	pretty	as	he	used to	be.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Oh,	yeah’	How’s	that?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mike	told	him	what	happened	at	Moody’s	Diner.	‘So,	he’s	standing	there,	and	I figure	I’ll	pop	him	one	more	time,	finish	the	job	before	he	falls	over,	and	he says,	‘Sometimes	you	just	gotta	take	a	beating.’	Well	I	can	relate	to	that.	I	did some	fighting’you	get	in	there	with	somebody	better	than	you,	and	about	two minutes	into	the	first	round	you	know	it’s	going	to	be	a	long	night.	So,	Harry looks	at	me	and	he	says,	‘You	ever	seen	Angel	Carerra”	I	said,	yeah,	a	couple	of years	ago.	‘You	should	see	her	now,’	he	says.	He’s	weaving	a	little,	blood	all over	him.	He	says,	‘Costing	me	my	marriage,	my	money.	And	I’m	not	feeling too	good	right	now.	But	you	know	what’	We	lit	up	the	fucking	bay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mike	chuckled.	”We	lit	up	the	fucking	bay,’	he	says,	‘so,	do	what	you	have	to do.’	Well,	what	with	one	thing	and	another,	we	got	to	talking	and	ended	up drinking	some	kind	of	fancy	whisky	in	his	car.	Frog	something.	Got	half	shit faced.	Really,	for	a	rich	asshole,	he	wasn’t	that	bad.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Fucking	Harry,’	Charley	said.	‘Hey,	we	get	together	on	the	outside,	beer’s	on me.	All	right?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘All	right.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘What	happened	to	Angel	Carerra?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Her	uncle	fixed	her	up	in	Florida.	Lauderdale,	I	think.	Got	her	out	of	town.	That was	the	end	of	that.’	Mike	flexed	a	long	muscled	arm.	A	good	guy	to	have	on your	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	last	two	months	dragged	on.	The	more	Charley	thought	about	what	he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a>would	do	when	he	got	out,	the	slower	the	days	went.	There	would	be	plenty	of time	to	figure	things	out	when	he	was	back	in	Hawaii,	he	told	himself,	but	it	was hard	to	stop.	He’d	get	a	new	driver’s	license	under	his	real	name,	get	a	tan,	talk things	over	with	Cait.	Maybe	they’d	move	to	the	Big	Island.	He	wouldn’t	drive	a cab.	That	was	the	past.	That	was	Ray.	Better	to	let	that	just	fade	away.	Get married	again.	Cait	wanted	to	do	that	as	soon	as	he	got	back.	Work	with	tools. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	details	didn’t	matter	too	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	told	his	mom	that	he	would	show	up	at	the	house	the	day	he	got	out.	That	he wasn’t	sure	exactly	when	he	would	be	released.	He’d	catch	a	ride,	take	a	bus,	or something.	He	didn’t	want	her	to	pick	him	up;	he	wanted	to	be	on	his	own	from the	first	minute,	although	he	didn’t	say	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cait	bought	him	a	ticket	to	Honolulu.	It	was	waiting	at	the	Portland	airport.	He sent	her	a	final	letter:	‘See	you	soon,	Charley	3!’	On	the	last	day,	he	said goodbye	to	Ray	Naki	and	wished	him	luck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Good,’	Ray	said.	Charley	felt	guilty	leaving	him	there,	two	years	to	go.	He	was a	better	man	than	a	lot	of	people	walking	around	outside;	it	didn’t	seem	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ray	sensed	what	Charley	was	feeling.	‘It’s	O.K.,’	he	said.	He	meant	life.	Charley would	never	forget	the	look	in	his	face,	forgiving	and	free’if	you	can	be	free when	you’re	locked	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Let’s	go,	Walker.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">They	gave	him	his	clothes,	and	he	signed	release	forms.	They	opened	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stepped	outside.	It	was	strangely	silent.	There	was	space	all	around.	It	was like	being	dropped	into	nothing.	A	man	got	out	of	a	police	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Hey,	Charley!’	It	was	Roland.	‘Thought	I’d	give	you	a	ride.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Well,	son	of	a	bitch,	Roland!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	would	have	visited,	but	I	didn’t	want	to	increase	your	popularity	inside.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Good	man.	It’s	weird	to	be	out.	Let’s	get	out	of	here.’	Suddenly	he	was	in	a	rush to	get	down	the	road,	away	from	the	dark	stone	and	brick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Roland	caught	him	up	on	what	had	been	happening.	Darlene	married	Billy McGinnis. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a>‘He	was	what,	two	years	behind	us?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yep.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Pretty	good	hitter,	right’	I	didn’t	think	he	was	up	to	Darlene,	though.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Hard	to	understand,’	Roland	said.	‘No	French	blood	in	him,	as	far	as	I	know.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	seen	Harry	George	around?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Marriage	shot,	what	I	heard.	He	got	knocked	around	pretty	good,	last	year.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	heard	about	it,’	Charley	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	talked	about	getting	together	in	Hawaii	or	the	next	time	Charley	was	in town.	Roland	switched	on	the	flashing	lights	when	he	pulled	into	the	driveway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Aloha,	Roland.	Take	care	of	yourself,	Buddy.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Bon	temps	roulez,’	Roland	said.	And	away	he	went. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Charley’s	mom	cried.	Ron	looked	relieved.	The	kids	teased	him	about	his jailhouse	tan	and	asked	a	lot	of	questions.	Molly	was	in	Vermont,	so	he	didn’t get	to	see	her.	It	was	possible	that	she	might	come	out	with	everybody	during	her Christmas	or	spring	break. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	morning,	they	saw	him	off	at	the	airport,	lots	of	hands	waving.	Charley took	a	look	around.	He	had	the	feeling	that	he	wasn’t	going	to	be	back	for awhile.	He	waved	and	walked	down	the	ramp,	ducking	into	the	narrow	door	of the	plane.	He	had	twelve	hours	to	go,	but	he	was	already	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a><b class="calibre3">22</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">On	a	fresh	summer	morning,	Harry	turned	into	his	old	driveway	and	stopped	in front	of	the	house.	He	took	a	check	from	his	aluminum	briefcase	and	knocked	on the	kitchen	door.	Lynn	opened	the	door	and	returned	to	stirring	dough	in	a stainless	mixing	bowl.	Harry	laid	the	check	on	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Here’s	the	rest	of	it.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Thank	you.	Fergus’	Your	daddy’s	here.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Daddy!	Daddy!’	Fergus	ran	into	the	room	at	full	speed.	Harry	picked	him	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Hey,	Champ!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Daddy,	we	go	on	the	boat?’	This	was	the	hard	part. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Not	today.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Why	not,	Daddy?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’ve	got	to	go	somewhere.	I	have	to	take	a	trip.	I	won’t	see	you	for	awhile.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	want	to	go	to	the	boat,	Daddy.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘We	will,’	Harry	said.	‘I	promise.	But	not	today.’	Lynn	filled	a	muffin	tin, studiously	quiet.	His	problem.	Fergus	pushed	against	his	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Boat,	Daddy.’	Harry	didn’t	want	to	put	him	down.	He	hugged	him	tighter	and whirled	him	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Bye,	Champ,’	he	said.	‘We’ll	go	on	the	boat	when	I	get	back.	What	a	good	boy!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">He	set	Fergus	on	his	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Say	goodbye	to	Daddy,	Fergus,’	Lynn	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Bye,	Daddy.’	Fergus	was	suddenly	sad,	as	though	he	were	soaking	up	the emotion	that	was	welling	over	in	Harry.	It	was	time	to	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a>‘Bye,	Fergus.’	He	walked	outside	and	to	the	car,	blinking	back	tears.	It	was	what it	was.	Sad.	But	he	had	to	get	out	of	town	for	awhile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	drove	to	the	turnpike	and	headed	south.	At	the	first	rest	stop,	twenty	miles past	Portland,	he	pulled	off	and	parked	between	two	semis.	Coffee.	You	have	to start	somewhere.	Start	with	coffee.	He	walked	across	the	parking	lot,	stretching his	legs.	Leaving	Fergus.	He	had	an	ache	in	his	chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	had	been	a	long	winter	after	the	divorce.	The	recession	had	knocked	property prices	down.	Eight	months	it	took	to	sell	the	land	that	he’d	split	off	the	property. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	it	was	done.	Lynn	was	set	for	a	few	years.	After	that,	she	still	had	the	house and	child	support	payments.	A	pretty	good	deal	for	her,	but	she’d	been	good about	Fergus’no	problem	about	seeing	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	usual,	in	their	way,	they	didn’t	talk	about	it	much.	He	had	left	her,	sexually. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	faced	it	and	threw	him	out.	The	divorce	was	right;	they	both	knew	it.	There wasn’t	enough	relationship	to	build	on,	aside	from	Fergus,	and	it	was	the	wrong way	around	to	rest	a	marriage	on	a	child. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	gotten	a	small	apartment	on	Morning	Street,	walked	to	the	Victory	Deli every	morning	for	breakfast,	had	a	couple	of	pints	of	Guinness	at	Dewey’s	in	the late	afternoon,	and	gone	home	to	watch	a	game.	Sometimes	he	stopped	at	the Village	Cafe	for	dinner;	sometimes	he	got	a	sub	to	take	out.	He	didn’t	go	to	T’s any	more.	Angel	was	gone.	Besides,	from	the	parking	lot	he	could	see construction	on	the	wharf	he	almost	bought.	Fucking	Sal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	didn’t	get	it	done,	Buddy,’	is	what	Sal	said.	‘But’never	take	food	off	a man’s	table.	Remember	that.	I’ll	give	you	a	hundred	and	a	half	for	the	plans.	I could	get	new	ones	for	less,	you	know	what	I	mean?’	Yeah,	and	wait	six	months. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	took	the	deal	and	paid	Mort	the	money	he	owed	him.	Eagleton’s	bills	and the	divorce	settlement	took	most	of	what	he	had	left.	He	still	had	deep	reserves in	the	Caymans.	At	some	point	on	this	trip	he’d	duck	in	there	for	cash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	regarded	himself	in	the	mirror	of	the	men’s	room.	His	nose	was	pushed	to one	side,	his	mouth	a	bit	battered.	‘Hard	years,’	he	said.	He’d	put	on	a	few pounds,	but	he	looked	calmer.	‘Handsome	devil.’	Peter	LeBourdais,	in Brunswick,	had	fixed	up	his	teeth	with	a	permanent	bridge.	Good	man,	Pete. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	been	patching	Harry	up	since	his	Bowdoin	hockey	days.	That	was	a	good thing	about	a	hometown’people	knew	you	through	ups	and	downs. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>He	sat	a	table	with	his	coffee,	in	no	particular	hurry.	For	the	first	time	in	his	life, he’d	been	stopped.	He’d	been	flat	on	his	ass	all	winter’not	working,	not	proving anything	to	anybody,	not	going	anywhere.	It	had	been	a	solitary	winter	as	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Don	Youker	had	talked	him	into	joining	a	hockey	league.	Once	a	week,	he	put on	his	gear	and	played	for	a	couple	of	hours.	He	didn’t	care	who	won	especially, but	he	liked	the	sudden	cuts,	a	swoop	into	the	corner,	a	quick	pass,	a breakaway’reminders	of	competence.	He’d	had	a	few	dates	that	didn’t	amount	to much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Angel	wrote	a	tearful	letter	saying	she’d	never	forget	him	(but	don’t	show	up).	It was	a	different	kind	of	divorce,	but	also	right.	Maybe	someday	he’d	have	a relationship	that	was	both	relaxed,	like	his	marriage,	and	total,	in	the	way	he’d been	with	Angel.	Anything	less	wasn’t	worth	the	trouble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	dinner	with	his	mother	every	other	week.	He	read	Pere	Goriot,	mostly	so that	he	could	make	a	joke	about	it	to	her,	and	enjoyed	it,	to	his	surprise.	He	read more	Balzac.	His	father	had	confounded	everyone	by	sailing	to	Africa.	He	was due	back	in	the	Bahamas	soon,	maybe	they	could	hook	up	down	there,	just	a	hop from	the	Caymans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	tossed	the	empty	cup	in	the	trash.	It	was	time	to	leave.	Break	the	habits he’d	settled	into.	Get	rolling.	Figure	out	what	to	do	next. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	took	the	Vermont	route	west,	had	a	late	lunch	at	the	Royal	Chelsea	Diner,	and drove	up	the	mountain.	The	trees	were	full	and	green,	the	air	hot	and	hazy,	but	he knew	what	it	would	be	like	in	a	few	months’white,	deserted,	ferocious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	passed	Wilmington	and	looked	for	the	spot	where	he’d	gone	off	the	road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Strangely,	he	couldn’t	find	it.	When	he	started	climbing	a	long	hill,	he	knew	that he	had	passed	it.	To	satisfy	his	curiosity,	he	turned	around.	He	found	a	driveway at	the	bottom	that	felt	like	the	place,	but	there	was	no	small	cabin	with	an attached	greenhouse	in	sight.	There	was	a	large,	raw,	executive	chalet	where Jared	Nathan’s	house	should	have	been. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	man	was	practicing	short	iron	shots	on	the	grass	in	front	of	the	house.	Harry got	out	of	the	car	and	walked	up	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Excuse	me,	I’m	looking	for	Jared	Nathan.	Didn’t	he	live	here,	or	around	here?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yes	sir,	he	did.	Yes	he	did.	Never	met	him	though.	Bought	the	place	through	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a>realtor.	What	I	heard’he	went	out	to	California,	had	a	daughter	out	there	needed help	some	way.’	Harry	stared	at	the	house.	‘He	had	a	small	place,	there.	We	took it	down.	We	entertain’you	know	how	it	is.	‘	He	extended	a	hand.	‘Bobby	Dale Bender.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Harry	George.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Harry	George	what?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Harry	George.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Oh.’	He	looked	at	Harry	sympathetically.	Life	with	a	truncated	name.	‘The	wife got	into	it,’	he	said.	‘She	was	right	there	with	the	architects	every	step	of	the way.	Lou	Anne,	well?’	Bobby	Dale	smiled	admiringly.	‘When	she	gets going’four	bathrooms,	a	lap	pool	you	can’t	see	from	around	this	side.	LOU</p>
<p class="calibre1">ANNE!’	A	woman	with	a	lot	of	hair	appeared	on	a	second	floor	balcony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Comin’	at	you,	Darlin!’	He	knocked	a	seven	iron	over	the	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Bobby	DALE?’	She	disappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Let	me	show	you,	Harry.	Wait	‘til	you	see	this.’	He	led	Harry	around	the	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	land	behind	the	house	had	been	cleared,	blasted,	and	shaped	for	a	great distance.	‘Eighteen	holes,’	Bobby	Dale	said.	‘Championship	course.	I	got	Jack’s team	designing	the	sucker.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	ever	been	here	in	the	winter?’	Harry	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Winter’	Not	me,	Boy.	Got	me	a	little	business	in	Atlanta.	This	is	for	summer fun.’	He	nudged	Harry’s	arm.	‘Might	even	make	me	some	money.	Fairway Estates	going	in	along	the	far	edge.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	noticed	a	small	group	of	fruit	trees	to	one	side,	two	rows	of	three,	neatly staked	and	taped,	healthy.	He	walked	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	don’t	know	what	they	all	are,’	Bobby	Dale	said.	‘The	wife	said	to	leave	‘em.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘They’re	Macouns,’	Harry	said.	‘Good	eating	apple.	One	of	the	best.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘That	Lou	Anne!’	Bobby	Dale	surveyed	his	burgeoning	golf	course.	‘Y’all	come back	now.	We’ll	have	us	a	round.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a>‘We’ll	do	that,’	Harry	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	got	on	the	road	and	drove	toward	Bennington.	Too	bad	about	the	little	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	could	see	Jared	Nathan,	his	intense	blue	eyes,	alive	and	amused.	He	heard him	saying,	Improve	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	wasn’t	offered	as	a	suggestion	or	advice.	Jared	was	talking	to	the	universe.	It was	a	refrain,	an	utterance	of	a	deep	need.	It	was	a	clue,	a	guide	to	a	way forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	drove	to	Bennington	and	spent	a	couple	of	days	checking	out	real	estate	in the	Bennington-Manchester	area.	On	impulse	one	night,	he	got	Charley’s telephone	number	from	Marianne	at	Jack	Eagleton’s	office.	When	he	called, Charley	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Hey	Charley,	this	is	Harry	George.	I’ve	got	a	delivery	for	you,	if	you	want	to take	it.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Can’t	do	it,’	Charley	said.	‘Too	busy	eating	pineapple.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Tough,’	Harry	said.	‘Look,	I	thought	I’d	call	and	say	hello,	wish	you	luck’umm, apologize.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Well,	thanks.	No	problem,	Harry.	The	way	I	look	at	it,	if	it	weren’t	for	you,	I wouldn’t	be	in	Hawaii	and	I	wouldn’t	have	met	Cait.	Sweet	years,	man.	Strange how	things	work	out.	How’s	your	nose?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You	heard	about	that?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Mike	Brannigan	told	me.	He	was	doing	time	when	I	got	out.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I’m	getting	used	to	it,’	Harry	said.	‘Reminds	me	to	be	a	little	more	careful	about who	I	deal	with.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Live	and	learn,	huh?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Try,	anyway,’	Harry	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘A	lot	happens	in	four	years,’	Charley	said.	‘Give	me	a	call	in	four	more;	we’ll see	what	the	hell	else	has	happened.	I	gotta	roll,	Harry.	Aloha.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a>‘Aloha.’	Harry	hung	up	and	looked	out	the	motel	window.	‘I	am	a	George,’	he said	out	loud.	‘I	will	prevail.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">No	one	clapped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	step	at	a	time,	he	told	himself.	Improve	something.	Improve	something. </p>
