FLOATING WONDER,<br class="calibre1"/>
<span class="xsm">OR</span><br class="calibre1"/>
<span class="sm2">FEMALE SPECTRE</span>.</h2>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="smcap">The</span> bridge over the river Usk, near Caerleon, in Wales, is formed of wood, and very curiously constructed, the tide rising occasionally to the almost incredible height of fifty or sixty feet. The boards which compose the flooring of this bridge being designedly loose, in order to float with the tide, when it exceeds a certain height, are prevented from escaping only by little pegs at the end of them; which mode of fastening does not afford a very safe footing for the traveller, and some awkward accidents have been known to arise from this cause. The following singular adventure occurred about twenty years since to a female of the neighbourhood, as she was passing it at night.</p>
<p class="calibre7"><a id="Page_188" title="[188]"></a></p>
<p class="calibre7">The heroine in question was a Mrs. Williams, who had been to spend a cheerful evening at a neighbour's house on the eastern side of the river, and was returning home at a decent hour. The night being extremely dark, she had provided herself with a lanthorn and candle, by the assistance of which she found her way to the bridge, and had already passed part of the dangerous structure, when she unfortunately trod on a plank that had by some accident lost the tenons originally fixed to the ends of it, and had slipped from its proper situation; the faithless board yielded to the weight of the good lady, who was rather corpulent, and carried her through the flooring, with her candle and lanthorn, into the river. Fortunately, at the moment of falling, she was standing in such a position, as gave her a seat on the plank similar to that of a horseman on his nag. It may be easily imagined, that Mrs. Williams must have been dreadfully alarmed at this change of situation, as well as the difference of element. Blessed, however, with great presence of mind, and a patient endurance of evil, the good lady was not overwhelmed by her fall, but steadily maintained her seat on the board; taking care, at the same time, to preserve her candle lighted, rightly supposing it would serve as a guide to any one who might be able or willing to assist her. Thus bestriding<a id="Page_189" title="[189]"></a> the plank, our heroine was hurried down the river towards Newport, the bridge of which, she trusted, would stop her progress, or that she might alarm the inhabitants with her cries. In both her hopes, however, she was disappointed: the rapidity of a spring tide sent her through the arch with the velocity of an arrow discharged from a bow, and the good people of the town had long been wrapped in slumber. Thus situated, her prospect became each moment more desperate; her candle was nearly extinguished! and every limb so benumbed with cold, that she had the greatest difficulty in <i class="calibre4">keeping her saddle</i>. Already she had reached the mouth of the Usk, and was on the point of encountering the turbulent waves of the British Channel, when the master of a fishing-boat, who was returning from his nightly toils, discovered the gleaming of her taper, and bearing her calls for assistance, though he at first thought her a witch, yet ventured to approach this floating wonder, and happily succeeded in rescuing Mrs. Williams from a watery grave, and bringing her in safety to the shore in his boat.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Thus was the life of a fellow-creature preserved by a poor fisherman's courage, in not being daunted by what he at first conceived a mysterious light proceeding from some sprite or hobgoblin; but, from duly examining into causes, proved himself both a hero and friend.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1"><span class="smcap">Who</span> is she, the poor maniac, whose wildly fix'd eyes<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">Seem a heart overcharg'd to express?<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">She weeps not, yet often and deeply she sighs;<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">She never complains, but her silence implies<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">The composure of settled distress.<br class="calibre12"/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1">No aid, no compassion, the maniac will seek;<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">Cold and hunger awake not her care:<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">Through her rags do the winds of the winter blow bleak<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">On her poor wither'd bosom, half bare; and her cheek<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">Has the deathly pale hue of despair.<br class="calibre12"/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1">Yet cheerful and happy, nor distant the day,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">Poor Mary the maniac has been!<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">The trav'ller remembers, who journey'd this way,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">No damsel so lovely, no damsel so gay,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">As Mary the Maid of the Inn.<br class="calibre12"/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><a id="Page_191" title="[191]"></a> <span class="i1">Her cheerful address fill'd the guests with delight,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">As she welcom'd them in with a smile:<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">Her heart was a stranger to childish affright,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">And Mary would walk by the abbey at night,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">When the wind whistled down the dark aisle.<br class="calibre12"/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1">She lov'd; and young Richard had settled the day,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">And she hoped to be happy for life:<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">But Richard was idle and worthless; and they<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">Who knew him would pity poor Mary, and say,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">That she was too good for his wife.<br class="calibre12"/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1">'Twas in autumn, and stormy and dark was the night,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">And fast were the windows and door;<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">Two guests sat enjoying the fire that burnt bright,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">And, smoking in silence with tranquil delight,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">They listen'd to hear the wind roar.<br class="calibre12"/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1">"'Tis pleasant," cried one, "seated by the fire-side,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">To hear the wind whistle without."<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">"A fine night for the abbey!" his comrade replied,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">"Methinks, a man's courage would now be well tried,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">Who should wander the ruins about.<br class="calibre12"/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><a id="Page_192" title="[192]"></a> <span class="i1">"I myself, like a school-boy, should tremble to hear<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">The hoarse ivy shake over my head;<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">And could fancy I saw, half-persuaded by fear,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">Some ugly old abbot's white spirit appear,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">For this wind might awaken the dead!"<br class="calibre12"/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1">"I'll wager a dinner," the other one cried,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">"That Mary would venture there now."<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">"Then wager and lose!" with a sneer, he replied,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">"I'll warrant she'd fancy a ghost by her side,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">And faint if she saw a white cow."<br class="calibre12"/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1">"Will Mary this charge on her courage allow?"<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">His companion exclaim'd with a smile;<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">"I shall win, for I know she will venture there now,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">And earn a new bonnet by bringing a bough<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">From the elder that glows in the aisle."<br class="calibre12"/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1">With fearless good humour did Mary comply,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">And her way to the abbey she bent;<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">The night it was dark, and the wind it was high,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">And as hollowly howling it swept through the sky,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">She shiver'd with cold as she went.<br class="calibre12"/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1">O'er the path so well known still proceeded the maid,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">Where the abbey rose dim on the sight.<br class="calibre12"/></span> <a id="Page_193" title="[193]"></a> <span class="i1">Through the gate-way she entered, she felt not afraid,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">Yet the ruins were lonely and wild, and their shade<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">Seem'd to deepen the gloom of the night.<br class="calibre12"/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1">All around her was silent, save when the rude blast<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">Howl'd dismally round the old pile;<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">Over weed-cover'd fragments still fearless she past,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">And arriv'd in the innermost ruin at last,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">Where the elder-tree grew in the aisle.<br class="calibre12"/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1">Well pleas'd did she reach it, and quickly drew near,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">And hastily gather'd the bough;<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">When the sound of a voice seem'd to rise on her ear—<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">She paus'd, and she listen'd all eager to hear,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">And her heart panted fearfully now.<br class="calibre12"/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1">The wind blew, the hoarse ivy shook over her head,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">She listen'd—nought else could she hear;<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">The wind ceas'd; her heart sunk in her bosom with dread,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">For she heard in the ruins distinctly the tread<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">Of footsteps approaching her near.<br class="calibre12"/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1">Behind a white column, half breathless with fear,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">She crept to conceal herself there:<br class="calibre12"/></span> <a id="Page_194" title="[194]"></a> <span class="i1">That instant the moon o'er a dark cloud shone clear,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">And she saw in the moon-light two ruffians appear,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">And between them a corpse did they bear.<br class="calibre12"/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1">Then Mary could feel her heart-blood curdle cold!<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">Again the rough wind hurried by—<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">It blew off the hat of the one,<a id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a class="fnanchor1" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a" href="part0004.html#Footnote_C_3">[C]</a> and, behold,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">Even close to the foot of poor Mary it roll'd—<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">She felt, and expected to die.<br class="calibre12"/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1">"Curse the hat!" he exclaims. "Nay, come on, and first hide<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">The dead body," his comrade replies.<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">She beheld them in safety pass on by her side,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">She seizes the hat, fear her courage supplied,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">And fast through the abbey she flies.<br class="calibre12"/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1">She ran with wild speed, she rush'd in at the door,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">She gaz'd horribly eager around:<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">Then her limbs could support their faint burden no more,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">And exhausted and breathless she sunk on the floor,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">Unable to utter a sound.<br class="calibre12"/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1">Ere yet her cold lips could the story impart,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">For a moment the hat met her view—<a id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a class="fnanchor1" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a" href="part0004.html#Footnote_D_4">[D]</a><br class="calibre12"/></span> <a id="Page_195" title="[195]"></a> <span class="i1">Her eyes from that object convulsively start,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">For, oh! God! what cold horror then thrill'd through her heart,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">When the name of her Richard she knew.<br class="calibre12"/></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i1">Where the old abbey stands on the common hard by,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">His gibbet is now to be seen:<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">Not far from the road it engages the eye,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i1">The trav'ller beholds it, and thinks, with a sigh,<br class="calibre12"/></span> <span class="i2">Of poor Mary, the Maid of the Inn.<br class="calibre12"/></span></div>

MAN WITH HIS HEAD ON FIRE,<br class="calibre1"/>
<span class="sm1">AND COVERED WITH BLOOD</span>.</h2>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="smcap">The</span> following singular adventure is related by a military captain.</p>
<p class="calibre7">"I was coming home one night on horseback, from a visit I had been making to a number of the neighbouring villages, where I had quartered my recruits. It happened there had fallen a deal of rain that day, since noon, and during all the evening, which had broken up the roads, and it was raining still with equal violence; but, being forced to join my company next morning, I set out, provided with a lanthorn, having to pass a strait defile between two mountains. I had cleared it, when a gust of wind took off my hat, and carried it so far, that I despaired of getting it again, and therefore gave the matter up. By great good fortune, I had with me my red cloak. I covered my head and shoulders with it, leaving nothing but a little hole to see my way, and breathe through; and, for fear the wind should take a fancy to my cloak, as well as my hat, I passed my right arm round my body to secure it: so that, riding on in<a id="Page_199" title="[199]"></a> this position, you may easily conceive my lanthorn, which I held in my right hand, was under my left shoulder. At the entrance of a village on a hill, I met three travellers, who no sooner saw me than they ran away as fast as possible. For my part, I went on upon the gallop; and when I came into the town, alighted at an inn, where I designed to rest myself a little. Soon after, who should enter, but my three poltroons, as pale as death itself. They told the landlord and his people, trembling as they spoke, that in the road they had encountered a great figure of a man all over blood, whose head was like a flame of fire, and to increase the wonder, placed beneath his shoulder. He was mounted on a dreadful horse, said they, quite black behind, and grey before; which, notwithstanding it was lame, he spurred and whipped right up the mountain with extraordinary swiftness. Here they ended their relation. They had taken care to spread the alarm as they were flying from this wondrous apparition, and the people had come with them to the inn in such a drove, that upwards of an hundred were all squeezed together, opening both their mouths and ears at this tremendous story. To make up in some sort for my dismal journey, I resolved to laugh a little, and be merry at their cost, intending to cure them of such fright, by shewing them their folly in the present<a id="Page_200" title="[200]"></a> instance. With this view, I got upon my horse again, behind the inn, and went round about till I had rode the distance of a mile or thereabouts; when, turning, I disposed of my accoutrements, that is to say, my cloak and lanthorn, as before, and on I came upon a gallop towards the inn. You should have seen the frighted mob of peasants, how they hid their faces at the sight, and got into the passage. There was no one but the host had courage to remain, and keep his eye upon me. I was now before the door, on which I shifted the position of my lanthorn, let my cloak drop down upon my shoulders, and appeared the figure he had seen me by his kitchen fire. It was not without real difficulty, we could bring the simple people who had crowded in for safety from their terror: the three travellers, in particular, as the first impression was still strong within them, they could not credit what they saw. We finished by a hearty laugh at their expence, and by drinking to the man whose head was like a flame of fire, and placed beneath his shoulder."</p>

<span class="sm2">AGREEABLE DISAPPOINTMENT</span>.</h2>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="smcap">The</span> following story is extracted from a letter I received, some time since, from a friend, on the subject of apparitions.</p>
<p class="calibre7">"Returning, one evening in the summer, to my apartments, at a short distance from town, I was invited by my landlady, a brisk young widow, to partake of <i class="calibre4">un petit souper</i>, as she termed it. The invitation, of course, I accepted; and, after a pleasant repast, the cloth being removed, various conversation ensued, and the terminating subject was ghosts and hobgoblins. After my attention had been greatly excited by many dreadful recitals, I thought I perceived something black glide swiftly by my feet. My back at that time being towards the door, I instantly turned round; and, perceiving the same to be shut, I fancied my fear to be only a chimæra arising from the subject we had been conversing on. I therefore replenished my glass; and the subject of spectres was again renewed. In the midst of the discourse, when I was all attention to some dreadful tale, I<a id="Page_202" title="[202]"></a> felt something gently brush the bottom of my chair; when, on looking down, I beheld the most hideous black figure imagination can conceive. It was a monster on all fours, with cloven feet, horns on its head, and a long tail trailing after it as it moved along. My terror, I will acknowledge, was so great, that I instantly jumped up as high as the table, and loudly vociferated, 'Lord have mercy upon me! what is it?' My friendly hostess now begged me to sit down and be a little calm, and she would explain to me the cause of my alarm. The figure having again disappeared, the lady of the ceremonies thus addressed me—'I beg your pardon, Sir, for the fright I have thus occasioned you. It is only a little joke I have been playing off, merely to see whether you were proof against supernatural appearances. A friend of mine having been to a masqued ball in a domino, I prepared the stratagem, by making a head-piece to the dress, with horns, false legs, cloven feet, and a tail. I then instructed my servant, who was by agreement to be in the adjoining room, on hearing a certain part of my story, to open the door as softly as possible, and to make her <i class="calibre4">entré</i>, in this habiliment. This she attempted before the plot was sufficiently ripe, when you turned round towards the door, and she retreated. The second attempt too effectually succeeded; for<a id="Page_203" title="[203]"></a> which I again ask your pardon, and am extremely sorry, though luckily it has had no bad effect. But I will never, while I live, again be induced to act so foolishly.'—"</p>
<div class="calibre10"></div><h2 id="pgepubid00053" class="calibre11"><span class="xsm">THE</span><br class="calibre1"/>
SPECTRE OF THE BROKEN.</h2>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="smcap">The</span> following observations on that singular phenomenon called the Spectre of the Broken, in Germany, is related by Monsieur J. L. Jordan, in the following words.</p>
<p class="calibre7">"In the course of my repeated tours through the Harz (mountains in Germany), I ascended the Broken twelve times: but I had the good fortune only twice (both times about Whitsuntide) to see that atmospheric phenomenon called the Spectre of the Broken, which appears to me so worthy of particular attention, as it must, no doubt, be observed on other high mountains, which have a situation favourable for producing it. The first time I was deceived by this extraordinary phenomenon, I had clambered up to the summit of the Broken very early in the morning, in order to wait for the inexpressibly beautiful view of the sun rising in the east. The heavens were already<a id="Page_204" title="[204]"></a> streaked with red; the sun was just appearing above the horizon in full majesty; and the most perfect serenity prevailed throughout the surrounding country; when the other Harz mountains in the south-west, towards the Worm mountains, &amp;c. lying under the Broken, began to be covered by thick clouds. Ascending at that moment the granite rocks called the Tempelskanzel, there appeared before me, though at a great distance, towards the Worm mountains and the Auchtermanshohe, the gigantic figure of a man, as if standing on a large pedestal. But scarcely had I discovered it, when it began to disappear; the clouds sunk down speedily, and expanded; and I saw the phenomenon no more. The second time, however, I saw this spectre somewhat more distinctly, a little below the summit of the Broken, and near the Heinnichshohe, as I was looking at the sun-rising, about four o'clock in the morning. The weather was rather tempestuous; the sky towards the level country was pretty clear; but the Harz mountains had attracted several thick clouds which had been hovering round them, and which, beginning on the Broken, confined the prospect. In these clouds, soon after the rising of the sun, I saw my own shadow, of a monstrous size, move itself, for a couple of seconds, in the clouds; and the phenomenon disappeared. It is<a id="Page_205" title="[205]"></a> impossible to see this phenomenon, except when the sun is at such an altitude as to throw his rays upon the body in an horizontal direction; for if he is higher, the shadow is thrown rather under the body than before it.</p>
<p class="calibre7">"In the month of September, last year, as I was making a tour through the Harz with a very agreeable party, and ascended the Broken, I found an excellent account and explanation of this phenomenon, as seen by M. Haue on the 23d of May 1797, in his diary of an excursion to that mountain; I shall therefore take the liberty of transcribing it.</p>
<p class="calibre7">"'After having been here for the thirtieth time,' says M. Haue; 'and, besides other objects of my attention, having procured information respecting the above-mentioned atmospheric phenomenon, I was at length so fortunate as to have the pleasure of seeing it; and, perhaps, my description may afford satisfaction to others who visit the Broken through curiosity. The sun rose about four o'clock; and, the atmosphere being quite serene towards the east, his rays could pass without any obstruction over the Heinnichshohe. In the south-west, however, towards the Auchtermaunshohe, a brisk west wind carried before it their transparent vapours, which were not yet condensed into thick heavy clouds. About a quarter past four I went towards <a id="Page_206" title="[206]"></a>the inn, and looked round to see whether the atmosphere would permit me to have a free prospect to the south-west; when I observed, at a very great distance, towards the Auchtermaunshohe, a human figure, of a monstrous size. A violent gust of wind having almost carried away my hat, I clapped my hand to it by moving my arm towards my head, and the colossal figure did the same. The pleasure which I felt on this discovery can hardly be described; for I had already walked many a weary step in the hope of seeing this shadowy image, without being able to satisfy my curiosity. I immediately made another movement by bending my body, and the colossal figure before me repeated it. I was desirous of doing the same thing once more; but my colossus had vanished. I remained in the same position, waiting to see whether it would return; and, in a few minutes, it again made its appearance in the Auchtermaunshohe. I paid my respects to it a second time, and it did the same to me. I then called the landlord of the Broken; and, having both taken the same position which I had taken alone, we looked towards the Auchtermaunshohe, but saw nothing. We had not, however, stood long, when two such colossal figures were formed over the above eminence, which repeated our compliment, by bending their bodies as we did; after which they<a id="Page_207" title="[207]"></a> vanished. We retained our position, kept our eyes fixed upon the same spot; and, in a little time, the two figures again stood before us, and were joined by a third. Every movement that we made by bending our bodies, these figures imitated; but with this difference, that the phenomenon was sometimes weak and faint, sometimes strong and well-defined. Having thus had an opportunity of discovering the whole secret of this phenomenon, I can give the following information to such of my readers as may be desirous of seeing it themselves. When the rising sun (and, according to analogy, the case will be the same at the setting sun) throws his rays over the Broken upon the body of a man standing opposite to fine light clouds floating around or hovering past him, he needs only fix his eye stedfastly upon them, and in all probability he will see the singular spectacle of his own shadow extending to the length of five or six hundred feet, at the distance of about two miles from him. This is one of the most agreeable phenomena I have ever had an opportunity of remarking on the great observations of Germany.'—"</p>

<div class="calibre10"></div><h2 id="pgepubid00054" class="calibre11">SIR HUGH ACKLAND.</h2>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="smcap">The</span> following remarkable fact shews the necessity of minutely examining people after death, prior to interment, and of not giving way to ridiculous fears about supernatural appearances.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The late Sir Hugh Ackland, of Devonshire, apparently died of a fever, and was laid out as dead. The nurse, with two of the footmen, sat up with the corpse; and Lady Ackland sent them a bottle of brandy to drink in the night. One of the servants, being an arch rogue, told the other, that his master dearly loved brandy when he was alive; "and," says he, "I am resolved he shall drink one glass with us now he is dead." The fellow, accordingly, poured out a bumper of brandy, and forced it down his throat. A gurgling immediately ensued, and a violent motion of the neck and upper part of the breast. The other footman and the nurse were so terrified, that they ran down stairs; and the brandy genius, hastening away with rather too much speed, tumbled down stairs head foremost. The noise of the fall, and his cries, alarmed a young gentleman who slept in<a id="Page_209" title="[209]"></a> the house that night; who got up, and went to the room where the corpse lay, and, to his great surprise, saw Sir Hugh sitting upright. He called the servants; Sir Hugh was put into a warm bed, and the physician and apothecary sent for. These gentlemen, in a few weeks, perfectly restored their patient to health, and he lived several years afterwards.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The above story is well known to the Devonshire people; as in most companies Sir Hugh used to tell this strange circumstance, and talk of his resurrection by his brandy footman, to whom (when he really died) he left a handsome annuity.</p>

AGREEABLE EXPLANATION.</h2>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span> of undoubted veracity relates the following story.</p>
<p class="calibre7">"When I was a young man, I took up my residence at a lodging-house, which was occupied by several families. On taking possession of my apartments, I agreed with the old lady of the house, who had two children, to accommodate me with a key to the street-door, to prevent unnecessary trouble to the servant or family, as I<a id="Page_210" title="[210]"></a> should very frequently stay out late in the evening. This was agreed to; and, by way of making things more agreeable, I had always a light left burning for me on the staircase, which was opposite to the outer door. This arrangement being made, things continued very comfortable for some months; till, one night, or rather morning, returning and opening the door as usual, I thought I heard a faint scream—I paused for a few seconds. The cry of 'Murder!' now feebly succeeded. I hesitated how to act, when the cry of 'Murder!' was again more loudly vociferated. This very much alarmed me; and, instead of going forward, I instantly re-opened the street-door, and was in the act of calling the watch, when a tall spare figure, at least six feet high, in a complete white dress, and pointed cap, with a candle in its hand, appeared before me. This unexpected encounter completed my astonishment, and I was about to speak, when the phantom (which proved to be my good old landlady) thus addressed me—'I hope, Sir, I have not alarmed you; but, just before you came to the door, I had a most frightful dream. I thought robbers had broken into my house, and, not content with plunder, had murdered my children, and were about to destroy me; when the noise you made on opening the door increased my agony of mind; and, before I was sufficiently sensible, <a id="Page_211" title="[211]"></a> I screamed out <i class="calibre4">Murder!</i> as you must have heard.' This explanation having taken place, the poor woman retired, and was for several days after extremely ill; and I was not a little pleased myself at finding what I at first supposed a supernatural encounter thus terminate, without having recourse to a divine exorcist."</p>
<div class="calibre10"></div><h2 id="pgepubid00056" class="calibre11"><span class="xsm">THE</span><br class="calibre1"/>
SOMERSETSHIRE DEMONIAC.</h2>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="smcap">On</span> the 13th of June 1788, George Lukins, of Yatton, in Somersetshire, was exorcised in the Temple Church at Bristol, and delivered from the possession of seven devils by the efforts of seven clergymen.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Lukins was first attacked by a kind of epileptic fit, when he was going about acting Christmas plays, or mummeries: this he ascribed to a blow given by an invisible hand. He was afterwards seized by fits; during which he declared with a roaring voice that he was the devil, and sung different songs in a variety of keys. The fits always began and ended with a strong agitation of the right hand; he frequently uttered dreadful execrations <a id="Page_212" title="[212]"></a>during the fits: and the whole duration of this disorder was eighteen years.</p>
<p class="calibre7">At length, <i class="calibre4">viz.</i> in June 1788, he declared, that he was possessed by seven devils, and could only be freed by the prayers, <i class="calibre4">in faith</i>, of seven clergymen. Accordingly, the requisite number was summoned, and the patient sung, swore, laughed, barked, and treated the company with a ludicrous parody on the <i class="calibre4">Te Deum</i>. These astonishing symptoms resisted both hymns and prayers, till a <i class="calibre4">small, faint voice</i> admonished the ministers to adjure. The spirits, after some murmuring, yielded to the adjuration; and the happy patient returned thanks for his wonderful cure. It is remarkable, that, during this solemn mockery, the fiend swore, by his infernal den, that he would not quit his patient; an oath, I believe, no where to be found but in the Pilgrim's Progress, from whence Lukins probably got it.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Very soon after, the first relation of this story was published, a person well acquainted with Lukins, took the trouble of undeceiving the public, with regard to his pretended disorder, in a plain, sensible, narrative of his conduct. He asserts, that Lukins's first seizure was nothing else than a fit of drunkenness; that he always foretold his fits, and remained sensible during their continuance. That he frequently saw Lukins in his fits;<a id="Page_213" title="[213]"></a> in every one of which, except in singing, he performed not more than most active young people can easily do. That he was detected in an imposture with respect to the clenching of his hands. That after money had been collected for him, he got very suddenly well. That he never had any fits while he was at St. George's Hospital, in London; nor when visitors were excluded from his lodgings by desire of the author of the narrative: and that he was particularly careful never to hurt himself by his exertions during the paroxysm.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Is it for the credit of this philosophical age, that so bungling an imposture should deceive seven clergymen into a public act of exorcism? This would not have passed even on the authors of the <i class="calibre4">Malleus Maleficarum</i>; for they required signs of supernatural agency, such as the suspension of the possessed in the air without any visible support, or the use of different languages, unknown to the demoniac in his natural state.</p>

<span class="sm2">FATAL EFFECTS OF WANTON MISCHIEF</span>.</h2>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="smcap">Some</span> years ago, a very intelligent, handsome, and promising youth, whose names is Henry Pargeter Lewis, the son of a respectable attorney, in the town of Dudley, was placed for a probationary time, previously to an intended apprenticeship, with a surgeon and apothecary of the name of Powell, in the immediate neighbourhood of one of our great public schools. He had not been there long, before one of the scholars, who lodged at the surgeon's, in league with the servant-boy of the house, devised the following stratagem to frighten him. One night, during an absence of the master, the servant-boy concealed himself under the bed of Henry, before the latter retired to rest, and remained there till the hour of midnight; when, on a preconcerted signal of three raps at the chamber door, it suddenly opened, and in stalked the school-boy, habited in a white sheet, with his face horribly disguised, and bearing a lighted candle in his hand; the servant-boy, at the same moment, heaving up<a id="Page_215" title="[215]"></a> the bed under Henry with his back. How long this was acted is not known: it was done long enough, however, completely to dethrone the reason of the unfortunate youth; who, it is supposed, immediately covered himself with the bed-clothes, and so continued till the morning. On his not rising at the usual time, some one of the family went to call him; and, not answering, except by incoherent cries, was discovered in the state just described.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The melancholy tidings of his situation were conveyed to his friends, on his removal to them; the facts having been disclosed, partly by the confession of the servant-boy, and partly by the unfortunate youth himself, during the few lucid intervals which occurred in the course of the first year after his misfortune.</p>
<p class="calibre7">His father and mother were then living, but they are now both dead: and the little property they left to support him is now nearly exhausted, together with a small subscription which was also raised to furnish him with necessaries, and to remunerate a person to take care of him. He is perfectly harmless and gentle, being rather in a state of idiotcy than insanity; seldom betraying any symptoms of violent emotion, except occasionally about midnight (the time of his unhappy disaster), when, full of indescribable terror, he<a id="Page_216" title="[216]"></a> exclaims, "<i class="calibre4">Oh! they are coming! they are coming!</i>" All hope of recovery is at an end; more than twenty years having elapsed since the catastrophe happened.</p>
<p class="calibre7">It is sincerely hoped that this pitiable case may prove a warning to inconsiderate youth; by showing them what dreadful effects may follow such wanton acts of mischief.</p>

DOUBLE DREAM,<br class="calibre1"/>
<span class="sm2">Without any Corresponding Event</span>.</h2>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="smcap">The</span> late Reverend Mr. Joseph Wilkins, a dissenting clergyman, at Weymouth, in Dorsetshire, had the following remarkable dream, which is copied verbatim from a short account of his life.</p>
<p class="calibre7">"One night, soon after I was in bed, I fell asleep, and dreamed I was going to London. I thought it would not be much out of my way to go through Gloucestershire, and call upon my friends there. Accordingly, I set out; but remember nothing that happened by the way, till<a id="Page_217" title="[217]"></a> I came to my father's house, when I went to the fore door and tried to open it, but found it fast; then I went to our back door, which I opened and went in: but finding all the family were in bed, I went across the rooms only, and walked up stairs, entered the room where my father and mother were in bed, and as I passed by the side of the bed in which my father lay, I found him asleep, or thought he was so; then I went to the other side, and as I just turned the foot of the bed, I found my mother awake, to whom I said these words, 'Mother, I am going a long journey, and am come to bid you good-bye;' upon which she answered me in a fright—'<i class="calibre4">O! dear son, thee art dead!</i>' with which I awoke, and took no notice of it more than a common dream, only it appeared to me very perfect, as sometimes dreams will. But, in a few days after, as soon as a letter could reach me, I received one by the post from my father; upon the receipt of which I was a little surprised, and concluded something extraordinary must have happened, as it was but a little before I had had a letter from my friends, and all were well: but, upon opening it, I was still more surprised; for my father addressed me as though I was dead, desiring me, if alive, or whose ever hands the letter might fall into, to write immediately. But, if the letter found me living, they concluded I<a id="Page_218" title="[218]"></a> should not live long, and gave this as a reason for their fears—That on such a night (naming it), after they were in bed, my father asleep and my mother awake, she heard somebody try to open the fore door, but finding it fast, he went to the back door, which he opened, and came in, and went directly through the room up stairs, and she perfectly knew it to be my step, come to her bed-side, and spoke to her these words, 'Mother, I am going a long journey, and am come to bid you good-bye,' upon which she answered in a fright, '<i class="calibre4">O! dear son, thee art dead!</i>' (which were the very circumstances and words of <i class="calibre4">my</i> dream); but she heard nothing more, she saw nothing (neither did I in my dream, as it was all dark). Upon this she awoke my father, and told him what had passed, but he endeavoured to appease her, persuading her it was only a dream; but she insisted on it, it was no dream, for that she was as perfectly awake as ever, and had not had the least inclination to sleep since she had been in bed (from which I am apt to think it was at the <i class="calibre4">very same instant</i> with my dream, though the distance between us was about one hundred miles, but of this I cannot speak positively). This affair happened whilst I was at the academy at Ottery, in the county of Devon, and I believe in the year 1754; and at this distance every circumstance is<a id="Page_219" title="[219]"></a> very fresh in my mind. I have since had frequent opportunities of talking over the affair with my mother, and the whole circumstance was as fresh upon her mind as it was upon mine. I have often thought that her sensation as to this matter was stronger than mine; and, what some may think strange, I cannot remember any thing remarkable happened thereon; and that this is only a plain simple narrative of matter of fact."</p>
<p class="calibre7">The above relation must convince credulous people how necessary it is, not to place implicit confidence in dreams, or suffer them to make too great an impression on the mind, as they are most frequently merely the result of our waking thoughts.</p>

POWER OF VISION.</h2>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="smcap">A shepherd</span> upon one of the mountains in Cumberland, was suddenly enveloped with a thick fog or mist, through which every object appeared so greatly increased in magnitude, that he no longer knew where he was. In this state of confusion he wandered in search of some unknown object, from which he might direct his future<a id="Page_220" title="[220]"></a> steps. Chance, at last, brought this lost shepherd within sight of what he supposed to be a very large mansion, which he did not remember ever to have seen before; but, on his entering this visionary castle, to inquire his way home, he found it inhabited by his own family. It was nothing more than his own cottage. But his organs of sight had so far misled his mental faculties, that some little time elapsed before he could be convinced that he saw real objects. Instances of the same kind of illusion, though not to the same degree, are not unfrequent in those mountainous regions.</p>
<p class="calibre7">From these effects of vision, it is evident that the pupil and the picture of an object within the eye, increase at the same time.</p>
<hr class="c"/>
<p class="calibre7">The writer of the above account was passing the Frith of Forth, at Queensferry, near Edinburgh, one morning when it was extremely foggy. Though the water is only two miles broad, the boat did not get within sight of the southern shore till it approached very near it. He then saw, to his great surprise, a large perpendicular rock, where he knew the shore was low and almost flat. As the boat advanced a little nearer, the rock seemed to split perpendicularly into portions, which separated at a little distance from one another. He next saw these perpendicular divisions move; and, upon approaching a little nearer,<a id="Page_221" title="[221]"></a> found it was a number of people, standing on the beach, waiting the arrival of the ferry-boat.</p>
<hr class="c"/>
<p class="calibre7">The following extract of a letter, from a gentleman of undoubted veracity, is another curious instance of the property of vision:—</p>
<p class="calibre7">"When I was a young man, I was, like others, fond of sporting, and seldom liked to miss a day, if I could any way go out. From my own house I set out on foot, and pursued my diversion on a foggy day; and, after I had been out some time, the fog or mist increased to so great a degree, that, however familiar the hedges, trees, &amp;c. were to me, I lost myself, insomuch that I did not know whether I was going to or from home. In a field where I then was, I suddenly discovered what I imagined was a well known hedge-row, interspersed with pollard trees, &amp;c. under which I purposed to proceed homewards; but, to my great surprise, upon approaching this appearance, I discovered a row of the plants known by the name of <i class="calibre4">rag</i>, and by the vulgar, <i class="calibre4">canker weed</i>, growing on a mere balk, dividing ploughed fields: the whole height of both could not exceed three feet, or three feet and a half. It struck me so forcibly that I shall never forget it; this too in a field which I knew as well as any man, could know a field."</p>

<span class="sm2">HAUNTED BED-ROOM</span>.</h2>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="smcap">In</span> one of the letters of this celebrated philosopher, he says, that he was consulted by his friend and patron the Count d'Alais, governor of Provence, on a phenomenon that haunted his bed-chamber while he was at Marseilles on some business relative to his office. The Count tells Gassendi, that, for several successive nights, as soon as the candle was taken away, he and his Countess saw a luminous spectre, sometimes of an oval, and sometimes of a triangular form; that it always disappeared when light came into the room; that he had often struck at it, but could discover nothing solid. Gassendi, as a natural philosopher, endeavoured to account for it; sometimes attributing it to some defect of vision, or to some dampness of the room, insinuating that perhaps it might be sent from Heaven to him, to give him a warning in due time of something that should happen. The spectre still continued its visits all the time that he staid at Marseilles; and some years afterwards, on their return to Aix, the Countess d'Alais<a id="Page_223" title="[223]"></a> confessed to her husband, that she played him this trick, by means of one of her women placed under the bed with a phial of phosphorus, with an intention to frighten him away from Marseilles, a place in which she very much disliked to live.</p>

GHOST ON SHIP-BOARD.</h2>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span> of high respectability in the navy relates the following story.</p>
<p class="calibre7">"When on a voyage to New York, we had not been four days at sea, before an occurrence of a very singular nature broke in upon our quiet. <i class="calibre4">It was a ghost!</i> One night, when all was still and dark, and the ship rolling at sea before the wind, a man sprung suddenly upon deck in his shirt, his hair erect, his eyes starting from their sockets, and loudly vociferating he had seen a ghost. After his horror had a little subsided, we asked him what he had seen?—he said, the figure of a woman dressed in white, with eyes of flaming fire; that she came to his hammock, and stared him in the face. This we treated as an idle dream, and sent the frantic fellow to his bed. The story became the subject of every one; and the succeeding<a id="Page_224" title="[224]"></a> night produced half a dozen more terrified men to corroborate what had happened the first, and all agreed in the same story, that it was a woman. This rumour daily increasing, at length came to the ears of the captain and officers, who were all equally solicitous to discover the true cause of this terrific report. I placed myself night by night beneath the hammocks to watch its appearance, but all in vain; yet still the appearance was nightly, as usual, and the horrors and fears of the people rather daily increased than diminished. A phantom of this sort rather amused than perplexed my mind; and when I had given over every idea of discovering the cause of this strange circumstance, and the thing began to wear away, I was surprised, one very dark night, as seated under the boats, with a stately figure in white stalking along the deck! The singularity of the event struck my mind that this must be the very identical ghost which had of late so much disturbed the ship's company. I therefore instantly dropped down from the place I was in, to the deck on which it appeared, when it passed me immediately very quickly, turned round, and marched directly forwards. I followed it closely, through the gallery, and out at the head-doors, when the figure instantly disappeared, which very much astonished me. I then leaped upon the forecastle, and asked<a id="Page_225" title="[225]"></a> of the people who were walking there, if such a figure had passed them? They replied, No, with some emotion and pleasure, as I had ever ridiculed all their reports on this subject. However, this night-scene between me and the ghost became the theme of the ensuing day. Nothing particular transpired till twelve o'clock, when, as the people were pricking at the tub for their beef, it was discovered Jack Sutton was missing. The ship's company was directly mustered, and Jack was no where to be found. I then inquired of his messmates the character of the man; and, after a number of interrogatories, one of them said, that poor Sutton used to tell him a number of comical jokes about his walking in his sleep. Now the mystery was unravelled; and this terrific ghost, which had so much alarmed all the sailors, now proved to be the poor unfortunate Jack Sutton, who had walked overboard in his dream."</p>
<p class="calibre7">The first fellow who spread this report, and who shewed such signs of horror, was found on inquiry to be a most flagitious villain, who had murdered a woman, who he believed always haunted him, and the appearance of this sleepwalker confirmed in his mind the ghost of the murdered fair one; for, in such cases, conscience is a busy monitor, and ever active to its own pain and disturbance.</p>

A GHOST,</h2>
<p class="chapsub2"><i class="calibre4">Thrice called for, as an Evidence, in a Court of Justice</i>.</p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="smcap">A farmer</span>, on his return from the market at Southam, in the county of Warwick, was murdered. A man went the next morning to his house, and inquired of the mistress, if her husband came home the evening before; she replied, No, and that she was under the utmost anxiety and terror on that account. "Your terror," added he, "cannot equal mine; for, last night, as I lay in bed quite awake, the apparition of your husband appeared to me, shewed me several ghastly stabs in his body; told me that he had been murdered by such a person (naming the man), and his body thrown into such a marl-pit, which he then particularly described. The alarm was given, the pit searched, the body found, and the wounds answered the description given of them. The man whom the ghost had accused was apprehended, and committed, on a violent suspicion of murder. His trial came on at Warwick, before the Lord Chief Justice Raymond; when the jury would have convicted, as rashly as the magistrate<a id="Page_227" title="[227]"></a> had committed him, had not the judge checked them. He addressed himself to them in words to this purpose—"I think, Gentlemen, you seem inclined to lay more stress on the evidence of an apparition than it will bear. I cannot say that I give much credit to these kind of stories: but, be that as it will, we have no right to follow our own private opinions here. We are now in a court of law, and must determine according to it; and I know of no law now in being, which will admit of the testimony of an apparition: not yet, if it did, doth the ghost appear to give evidence. Crier," said he, "call the ghost." Which was <i class="calibre4">thrice</i> done, to no manner of purpose: it appeared not. "Gentlemen of the Jury," continued the Judge, "the prisoner at the bar, as you have heard by undeniable witnesses, is a man of the most unblemished character; nor has it appeared in the course of the examination, that there was any manner of quarrel or grudge between him and the party deceased. I do believe him to be perfectly innocent; and, as there is no evidence against him, either positive or circumstantial, he must be acquitted. But, from many circumstances which have arisen during the trial, I do strongly suspect that the gentleman who saw the apparition was himself the murderer: in which case he might easily ascertain the pit, the wounds, <a id="Page_228" title="[228]"></a>&amp;c. without any supernatural assistance; and on suspicion, I shall think myself justified in committing him to close custody, till the matter can be fairly inquired into. This was immediately done, and a warrant granted for searching his house; when such strong proofs of guilt appeared against him, that he confessed the murder: for which he was executed.</p>
