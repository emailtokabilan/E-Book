<p class="calibre8">I am sorry I cannot devise a key by which to read this book, as well as a Key to the Calories, for sometimes you are to read the title headings and side explanations before the text. Other times you are supposed to read the text and then the headings. It really does not matter much as long as you read them both. Be sure to do that. They are clever. <i class="calibre9">I wrote them myself</i>.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I have been accused of trying to catch you coming and going, because I have included in my book the right methods of gaining weight, as well as those for losing weight. But this is not the reason—though I don't object to doing that little thing—the reason is that the lack of knowledge of foods is the foundation for both overweight and underweight.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I did want my publishers to get this out in a cheaper edition, thinking that more people could have it, and thus it would be doing more good; but they have convinced me that that idea was a false claim of my mortal mind, and that the more you paid for it, the more you would appreciate it. I have received many times, and without grumbling on my part, ten dollars for the same advice given in my office. Perhaps on this line of reasoning we should have ten dollars for the book. Those of you who think so may send the balance on through my publishers.</p>

<h3 class="c" id="pgepubid00014">Are You Thin and Do You Want to Gain?</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">Don't Read This</i></div>
<div class="figright"></div>
<p class="calibre8">Skip this chapter. It will not interest you in the least. I will come to you later. I am not particularly interested in you anyway, for I cannot get your point of view. How any one can want to be anything but thin is beyond my intelligence. However, knowing that there are such deluded individuals, I have been constrained to give you advice. You won't find it spontaneous nor from the heart, but if you follow my directions I will guarantee that you will gain; providing, of course, you have no organic trouble; and the chances are that by giving proper attention to your diet you will gain anyway, and maybe in passing lose your trouble. Who knows?</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">Bad Business</i></div>
<p class="calibre8">In war time it is a crime to hoard food, and fines and imprisonment have followed the exposé of such practices. Yet there are hundreds of thousands of individuals all over America who are hoarding food, and that one of the most precious of all foods! <i class="calibre9">They have vast amounts of this valuable commodity stored away in their own anatomy</i>.</p>
<div class="figcenter"><br class="calibre1"/>
<br class="calibre1"/>
<br class="calibre1"/></div>
<div class="figleft"></div>
<p class="calibre8">Now fat individuals have always been considered a joke, but you are a joke no longer. Instead of being looked upon with friendly tolerance and amusement, you are now viewed with distrust, suspicion, and even aversion! How dare you hoard fat when our nation needs it? You don't dare to any longer. You never wanted to be fat anyway, but you did not know how to reduce, and it is proverbial how little you eat. Why, there is Mrs. Natty B. Slymm, who is beautifully thin, and she eats twice as much as you do, and does not gain an ounce. You know positively that eating has nothing to do with it, for one time you dieted, didn't eat a thing but what the doctor ordered, besides your regular meals, and you actually gained.</p>
<div class="figright"></div>
<p class="calibre8">You are in despair about being anything but fat, and—! how you hate it. But cheer up. I will save you; yea, even as I have saved myself and many, many others, so will I save you.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">Spirituality vs. Materiality</i></div>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">A Long, Long Battle</i></div>
<p class="calibre8">It is not in vain that all my life I have had to fight the too, too solid. Why, I can remember when I was a child I was always being consoled by being told that I would outgrow it, and that when I matured I would have some shape. Never can I tell pathetically "when I was married I weighed only one hundred eighteen, and look at me now." No, I was a delicate slip of one hundred and sixty-five when I was taken.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I never will tell you how much I have weighed, I am so thoroughly ashamed of it, but my normal weight is one hundred and fifty pounds, and at one time there was seventy pounds more of me than there is now, or has been since I knew how to control it. I was not so shameless as that very long, and as I look back upon that short period I feel like refunding the comfortable salary received as superintendent of an hospital; for I know I was only sixty-five per cent efficient, for efficiency decreases in direct proportion as excess weight increases. Everybody knows it.</p>
<h3 class="c" id="pgepubid00015">The Meeting Is Now Open for Discussion</h3>
<p class="calibre8">Jolly Mrs. Sheesasite has the floor and wants some questions answered. You know Mrs. Sheesasite; her husband recently bought her a pair of freight scales.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">Mrs. Sheesasite</i></div>
<p class="calibre8">"Why is it, Doctor, that thin people can eat so much more than fat people and still not gain?"</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">Me Answering</i></div>
<p class="calibre8">"First: Thin people are usually more active than fat people and use up their food.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Second: Thin people have been proved to radiate fifty per cent more heat per pound than fat people; in other words, fat people are regular fireless cookers! They hold the heat in, it cannot get out through the packing, and the food which is also contained therein goes merrily on with fiendish regularity, depositing itself as fat.</p>
<div class="figcenter"><br class="calibre1"/>
<br class="calibre1"/>
<br class="calibre1"/></div>
<p class="calibre8">"And there are baby fireless cookers and children fireless cookers. The same dietetic rules apply to them as to the adult."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"I recognize Mrs. Tiny Weyaton; then you, Mrs. Knott Little."</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">Mrs. Weyaton</i></div>
<p class="calibre8">"We have heard you say that fat people eat too much, and still we eat so little?"</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">Me Again</i></div>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes, you eat too much, <i class="calibre9">no matter how little it is</i>, even if it be only one bird-seed daily, <i class="calibre9">if you store it away as fat</i>. For, hearken; food, and food only (sometimes plus alcohol) maketh fat. Not water—not air—verily, nothing but food maketh fat. (And between you and me, Mrs. Weyaton, just confidential like—don't tell it—we know that the small appetite story is a myth.)"</p>
<div class="figright"></div>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">Mrs. Knott Little</i></div>
<p class="calibre8">"But, Doctor, is it not true that some individuals inherit the tendency to be fat, and can not help it, no matter what they do?"</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">Doctor</i></div>
<p class="calibre8">"Answer to first part—Yes.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Answer to second part—No! It is not true that they cannot help it; they have to work a little harder, that is all. It is true that being fat is a disease with some, due to imperfect working of the internal secretory glands, such as the thyroid, generative glands, etc.; but that is not true fat such as you have. Yours, and that of the other members who are interested, is due to overeating and underexercising.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">Not</i>?</div>
<p class="calibre8">"Those diseased individuals should be under the care of a physician. Probably the secretory glands are somewhat inactive or sluggish in the healthy fat individual. I use the word <i class="calibre9">healthy</i> here in contradistinction to the other type. In reality, individuals very much overweight are not really healthy, and they should also visit their physician."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes, Mrs. Ima Gobbler?"</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">Mrs. Ima Gobbler</i></div>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">Doctor Dear</i></div>
<p class="calibre8">"But, Doctor dear, what's the use of dieting? I only get fatter after I stop."</p>
<p class="calibre8">(Answering delicate like, for I'm fond of her and she is sensitive):</p>
<p class="calibre8">"You fat—! You make me fatigued! <i class="calibre9">You never diet long enough</i> to get out of the fireless cooker class. <i class="calibre9">If you did, you wouldn't."</i></p>
<p class="calibre8">"Is there anyone else who would like to be recognized? No?"</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">Nothing That I Don't Know</i></div>
<p class="calibre8">It is well. I will probably answer more as I go along, for there is nothing that I don't know or haven't studied or tried in the reducing line. I know everything you have to contend with—how you no sooner congratulate yourself on your will power, after you have dragged yourself by the window with an exposure of luscious fat chocolates with curlicues on their tummies, than another comes into view, and you have it all to go through with again, and how you finally succumb.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I hope sometime it will be a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment, to display candy as shamelessly as it is done.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Many fond parents think that candy causes worms. It doesn't, of course, unless it is contaminated with worm eggs, but, personally, I wish every time I ate a chocolate I would get a worm, then I would escape them. The chocolates, I mean. I will tell you more about worms when I discuss meat.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">Vampires</i></div>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">Malicious Animal Magnetism?</i></div>
<p class="calibre8">I know how you go down to destruction for peanuts, with their awful fat content. It is terrible, the lure a peanut has for me. Do you suppose Mr. Darwin could explain that?</p>
<p class="calibre8">Perhaps I was a little too delicate like in my answer to Mrs. Gobbler's question,—What's the use of dieting, she only gets fatter after she stops?</p>
<p class="calibre8">So many ask me that question, with the further pathetic addition,—Will they always have to keep it up? And it ever irritates me.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The answer is,—Yes! You will always have to keep up dieting, just as you always have to keep up other things in life that make it worth living—being neat, being kind, being tender; reading, studying, loving.</p>
<p class="calibre8">You will not have to be nearly so strenuous after you get to normal; <i class="calibre9">but you might as well recognize now, and accept it as a fact, that neither you nor anybody else will be able to eat beyond your needs without accumulating fat or disease, or both.</i></p>
<p class="calibre8">I love Billy Sunday's classical answer to the objection that his conversions were not permanent. He responded: "Neither is a bath!"</p>
<h3 id="pgepubid00016" class="calibre7">WHEN YOU START TO REDUCE</h3>
<p class="calibre8">you will have the following to combat:</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">A Combat</i></div>
<p class="calibre8">First: Your husband, who tells you that he does not like thin women. I almost hate my husband when I think how long he kept me under that delusion. Now, of course, I know all about his jealous disposition, and how he did not want me to be attractive.</p>
<div class="figright"></div>
<p class="calibre8">Second: Your sister, who says, "Goodness, Lou, but you look old today; you looked lots better as you were."</p>
<div class="figright"></div>
<p class="calibre8">Third: Your friends, who tell you that you are just right now; don't lose another pound! And other friends who tell you cheerful tales of people they have known who reduced, and who went into a decline, and finally died.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">To Avoid Slack in Your Neck, Double and Triple Chins, Massage Vigorously Up and Down, Not Crossways</i></div>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">I Am Interesting</i></div>
<p class="calibre8">But you must not mind them. Smile, and tell them that you know all about it, and don't worry. Go serenely on your way, confident in your heart that you will look fully ten years younger when you get down to normal, no matter how you look in the interim. I don't see why women, and men, too, (secretly) worry so much about wrinkles. If the increased wrinkles on the face are accompanied by increased wrinkles in the gray matter, 'tis a consummation devoutly to be wished. I'm sure I am much more interesting with wrinkles than I was without. I am to myself, anyway.</p>
<p class="calibre8">However, you will not be any more wrinkled if you reduce gradually, as I advise, and keep up your exercises at least fifteen minutes daily.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">I Have a Beautiful Complexion</i></div>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">I Attended an Art School Six Months Once</i></div>
<p class="calibre8">Take care of your face, alternate hot and cold water, glycerine one-quarter, rose water three-quarters, cold cream packs, massage gently, a little ice—you know what to do—you<br class="calibre1"/>
<span class="c2">need not fear. You will not only look ten</span><br class="calibre1"/>
years younger and live twenty years longer—I assert it boldly—but your complexion and efficiency will be one hundred per cent better.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">Joy</i>!</div>
<p class="calibre8">If there is anything comparable to the joy of taking in your clothes, I have not experienced it. And when you find your corset coming closer and closer together (I advise a front lace, so this can be watched), and then the day you realize that you will have to stitch in a tuck or get a new one!</p>
<p class="calibre8">But don't be in a hurry to make your clothes smaller now. If they are loose they will show to the world that you are reducing. A fat person in a tight suit, unless it is perfectly new, should be interned.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">Food Only</i></div>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">Impossible</i></div>
<p class="calibre8">I have said that food, and food only, causes fat. That gives you the cue to what you must do to get rid of it. No anti-fat medicines unless under the supervision of your scientific, educated physician. They are dangerous; most of them contain thyroid extract, arsenic, or mercury. Even the vendors of these harmful compounds in their advertisements are now saying to "stop harmful drugging," but urge you to adopt their particular delightful product, and, "without dieting or exercises, you will positively reduce," and so forth.</p>
<p class="calibre8">No drastic purges, no violent exercises, especially at first, and not too frequent nor prolonged Turkish baths. Epsom salts baths have little effect. If salts are used habitually internally, they are harmful. All of these are unscientific and unsuccessful, and the things they bring on are worse than the fat.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Now, if food is the only source of body substance, you see that you must study that question, and that is what I will give you—some lessons on foods and their values.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">Candy Cake, Pie, Rich Meats, Thick Gravy, Bread, Butter, Nuts, Ice Cream</i></div>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">Whipped Cream, Candied Sweet Potatoes</i></div>
<p class="calibre8">Heretofore you have known only in a dumb, despairing sort of way that all the foods you like are fattening, and all the advice you read and hear is that you must avoid them as a pestilence. And you settle down to your joyless fatness, realizing that it is beyond human strength to do that forever, and that you would rather die young and fat, anyway, than to have nothing to eat all your life but a little meat, fish, and sloshy vegetables. Study on, and you will find the reason your favorite foods are fattening.</p>
<p class="calibre8">But cast off your dejection. <i class="calibre9">You don't have to avoid them</i>!</p>
<p class="calibre8">Eat what you like and grow thin? Yes; follow me. I know it will be an exertion, but you must persist and go through with it. Nothing in life worth while is attained without some effort. So begin now; it is the price of liberty.</p>

<div class="center">Definition to learn:</div>
<p class="calibre8">CALORIE; symbol C.; a heat unit and food value unit; is that amount of heat necessary to raise one pound of water 4 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">Pronounced Kal'-o-ri</i></div>
<p class="calibre8">There is a good deal of effort expended by many semi-educated individuals to discredit the knowledge of calories, saying that it is a foolish food science, a fallacy, a fetish, and so forth.</p>
<p class="calibre8">They reason, or rather say, that because there are no calories in some of the very vital elements of foods—the vitamines and the mineral salts—therefore it is not necessary to know about them. They further argue that their grandfathers never heard of calories and they got along all right. That grandfather argument always enrages my mortal mind.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">A Unit of Measure</i></div>
<p class="calibre8">Now you know that a calorie is a unit of measuring heat and food. It is not heat, not food; simply a unit of measure. And as food is of supreme importance, certainly a knowledge of how it should be measured is also of supreme importance.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">Yes, They Are Kosher</i></div>
<p class="calibre8">You should know and also use the word calorie as frequently, or more frequently, than you use the words foot, yard, quart, gallon, and so forth, as measures of length and of liquids. Hereafter you are going to eat calories of food. Instead of saying one slice of bread, or a piece of pie, you will say 100 Calories of bread, 350 Calories of pie.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The following is the way the calorie is determined:</p>
<p class="calibre8">An apparatus known as the bomb calorimeter has two chambers, the inner, which contains the dry food to be burned, say a definite amount of sugar, and an outer, which is filled with water. The food is ignited with an electric connection and burned. This heat is transferred to the water. When one pound of water is raised 4 degrees Fahrenheit, the amount of heat used is arbitrarily chosen as the unit of heat, and is called the Calorie.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Food burned (oxydized) in the body has been proved to give off approximately the same amount of heat or energy as when burned in the calorimeter.</p>

<p class="calibre8">Can you see now why fats are valuable? Why they make fat more than any other food? They give off more than two and one-fourth times as much heat, or energy, as the other foods.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">See Next Chapter for Definitions</i></div>
<p class="calibre8">Notice that protein and carbohydrates have the same food value as to heat or energy, each 113 Calories to the dry ounce. However, they are not interchangeable; that is, carbohydrates will not take the place of protein for protein is absolutely necessary to build and repair tissue, and carbohydrates cannot do that. But fats and carbohydrates are interchangeable as fuel or energy foods.</p>
<h3 class="c" id="pgepubid00020">Calories Needed per Day for Normal Individuals</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">Business of Growing</i></div>
<p class="calibre8">This depends upon age, weight, and physical activities; the baby and the growing child needing many more calories per pound per day than the adult, who has to supply only his energy and repair needs. The aged require still less than the young adult. As to weight; I have told you why overweight individuals need so little. As to physical activities; the more active, obviously the more calories needed, for every movement consumes calories.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">Many Know Nothing of This</i></div>
<p class="calibre8">The Maine lumbermen, for instance, while working during the winter months, consume from 5000 to 8000 Calories per day. But they do a tremendous amount of physical work.</p>
<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre9">Mental work does not require added nourishment.</i> This has been proved, and if an excess be taken over what is needed at rest (if considerable exercise is not taken while doing the mental work) the work is not so well done.</p>

<h3 class="c" id="pgepubid00022">Example of Finding Number of Calories Needed</h3>
<p class="calibre8">1. Determine normal weight by rule.</p>
<p class="calibre8">2. Multiply normal weight by number of calories needed per pound per day.</p>
<p class="calibre8">For example, say you weigh 220 or 125 lbs., but by the rule for your height your weight should be 150 lbs.; then 150 would be the number you would use.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i class="calibre9">Work Out Your Requirements</i></div>
<p class="calibre8">By the rule I have given, adults require 15-20 Calories per pound per day, depending upon activity. For example, if you have no physical activities, then take the lowest figure, 15. 150x15—2250. Therefore your requirement, if your weight should be 150, is 2250 Calories per day.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Now, if you want to lose, cut down 500-1000 Calories per day from that.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Five hundred Calories equal approximately 2 ounces of fat. Two ounces per day would be about 4 pounds per month, or 48 pounds per year. Cutting out 1000 Calories per day would equal a reduction of approximately 8 pounds per month, or 96 pounds per year. These pounds you can absolutely lose by having a knowledge of food values (calories) and regulating your intake accordingly. You can now see the importance of a knowledge of calories.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><span class="c3">1  lb. fat 4000 C</span><br class="calibre1"/>

<p class="calibre8">VITAMINES: Health preservers. Vital substances necessary for growth. The chemistry of these products is at present not thoroughly understood, but their importance has been demonstrated by experiments (not torture) on animals.

Down with animal experimentation! Let us do everything in our power to hamper scientific work of this kind. We are giving up our husbands, fathers, sons, perhaps to die, for the cause of humanity, but a guinea pig! Horrors!</p>
<p class="calibre8">It has been found that the vitamines, like the minerals, are most abundant in the outer coverings and the germ of grains, and in fruits and vegetables. They are also present in fresh milk, butter, meat and eggs. Babies fed pasteurized or boiled milk should have fruit juices and vegetable purees early. Begin with one-half teaspoonful, well diluted, and gradually increase the feeding to an ounce or more between meals once or twice daily.</p>

<p class="calibre8">Mineral oils (refined paraffine) also are not absorbable, and they act with benefit in some cases. About the worst thing to do, in general, is to take physics constantly. These are not physics, however; they act mechanically. Even the C.S. (common-sense?) individual can take these. The agar may be taken two or three heaping teaspoonfuls in a large glass of water before retiring, or in the morning before breakfast, or in lieu of 4 o'clock tea. Drink it down rapidly—for goodness' sake, don't try to chew it.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Mineral oil will make fine mayonnaise dressing. It has little or no food value, so the constipated overweight individual may indulge freely. For faulty elimination, then—</p>
