<h2 id="calibre_toc_9" class="calibre3">Chapter 7</h2>
<p class="calibre1">There was a soft knock at Greg and Cynthia’s bedroom door.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They froze in place, moving only their eyes—to check the glowing numbers on the alarm clock. It was nearly 1:00 AM.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“How late do we have to wait to make sure we don’t get interrupted?” whispered Greg in frustration.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sorry,” whispered Cynthia.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Greg rolled to the side, and Cynthia got up, slipped on her robe, and went to the door.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sorry to bother you, Honey,” said Beverly, “but I’m having trouble going to sleep. Do you have any more of those over-the-counter sleeping pills?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think so, Mom. Just a second.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cynthia went into the bathroom, and checked the medicine cabinet. She found the bottle of pills, and took it to her mother. “Hope this helps.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sure it will. Sorry I woke you up.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s okay, Mom.” Cynthia closed the door, and took off her robe. She slid between the sheets, and snuggled her naked body up against Greg’s. “I’m sorry, Sweetie.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Baby, you know I love your mom, but—”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“—I know. It really spoils the mood when she does that.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not just when she comes to the door. It’s <i class="calibre2">knowing</i> that she could knock at any moment. And as much as you turn me on, it really… “</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cynthia had begun to nibble on his ear.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Greg forced himself to continue. “We’ve got to do something about this… “</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cynthia slung her leg across him, and got on top. Then she gave him a hot, moist kiss.</p>
<p class="calibre1">His senses were overwhelmed by her mouth, her hands, her smooth warm body. He didn’t even care that she had purposely derailed his train of thought.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She whispered into his ear, “I want to have your baby, Greg.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know. I want to <i class="calibre2">give</i> you a baby. But, take it easy—you’re about to make me—”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“—it’s okay. It’s late. Let it go.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh, God, thought Greg. What did I ever do to deserve this amazing woman?</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2"> </i> *</p>
<p class="calibre1">Billy-Eye checked his watch again. It was after 6:00. Why did they have to be late every morning? Especially <i class="calibre2">this</i> morning.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Craig and Lenny walked into <i class="calibre2">The Biscuit</i> with their heads held low. They knew they were going to be chewed out again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Judy saw them coming in late, as usual, and shook her head, but didn’t say a word.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When Billy-Eye looked up and saw his sons standing there at his booth, he jumped up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lenny thought the old man was going to pull a Moe, and slam their two heads together, like Curly and Larry. They deserved it—they were his stooges. Why couldn’t they ever learn to be on time?</p>
<p class="calibre1">But instead, he grabbed one in each arm and bear-hugged the breath out of them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” said Craig, confused.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re alive!” said Billy-Eye.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well… yeah,” said Craig.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come on,” said Billy-Eye. “Sit down. Let’s have a great big breakfast together.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,” said Lenny. Bring on the food.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s going on?” said Craig.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Billy-Eye’s chin quivered slightly as he spoke. He was still not over the thought that one of his sons had been taken from him. “A guy dropped in for some biscuits a few minutes ago, and was saying that his brother-in-law went out early this morning for some fishing, and found a body.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Sabine River.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“A <i class="calibre2">dead</i> body?” said Lenny.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Craig sneered at his brother. “Well, it wouldn’t be much of a story if the man was alive, now would it, Lenny?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, I was worried about you boys,” said Billy-Eye. “I assumed y’all were asleep in your rooms when I left the house this morning. But then I started wondering.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Was it anybody we know?” said Lenny.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Craig punched him in the arm. “Daddy just said he thought it might be one of us. He doesn’t <i class="calibre2">know</i> who it was.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lenny rubbed his arm. “Oh.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Judy brought them each a cup of coffee, and took their breakfast orders.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay, now let’s get down to business,” said Billy-Eye. “Have you got the band auditions all lined up?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, Sir,” said Craig. “We’ve got eleven bands.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, you’ll do the whole thing on Friday night?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, Sir. The first band will start at 6:30, and the last one will finish just before midnight. Then I will decide on the winner and make the announcement.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, Sir,” said Billy-Eye. “<i class="calibre2">I</i> will decide the winner.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">No, thought Craig. What if he doesn’t pick Cindy’s group? Then Craig would <i class="calibre2">never</i> get into her pants. “I thought you were going to leave that up to <i class="calibre2">me</i>.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was,” said Billy-Eye. “But then I started thinking about how easily you’re influenced. I won’t stand for any favoritism. We want the best band.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Craig scowled at his brother. “Lenny—you rat! You told him, didn’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Told me what?” said Billy-Eye.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing,” said Craig.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good. Then it’s understood. You boys will have everything in tip-top shape by the time I get there at around 5:30.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, Sir,” they said in unison.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Craig stomped on Lenny’s foot.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lenny grimaced, but said nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, who’s this girl, Craig?” Billy-Eye took a sip of his coffee.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which one?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Billy-Eye chuckled. His pulsating belly made the booth table shake, spilling a little of Craig’s coffee.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Craig picked up his cup and wiped the sides and bottom with his napkin. “Her name is Cindy. She’s the drummer in an all-girl band.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Blonde, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, Sir.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay. Now I know who will <i class="calibre2">not</i> win.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Daddy!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Billy-Eye laughed so hard that he began to cough. Finally, he regained control. “I’m kidding. The best band will win—even if it ends up being Cindy’s band. I want what’s best for the business. We’re gonna be paying a lot of money for that band. And we’ll be depending on them to develop a following, so we can sell T-shirts and posters and all kinds of souvenirs.” He took another sip from his cup. “We’re gonna make a fortune, Boys.”</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2"> </i> *</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I thought you were gonna just sleep all day,” said Val sarcastically. She was in her recliner, sipping one last cup of coffee before driving over to Wal-Mart to work her shift. Her favorite game show, <i class="calibre2">The Price Is Right</i>, came on at 10:00 AM, fifteen minutes before she had to leave for work.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I needed the rest. We’ve got a long practice session today.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where are y’all practicing?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right here in the living room.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, you’re not!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why not? We won’t hurt anything. And we’ll be done before you get home.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll play too loud, and make my neighbors mad.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Val, I promise—we’ll hold it down.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“And I don’t want any guys using my bathroom. They pee all over the floor.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“There are no <i class="calibre2">guys</i>, Mother. It’s an all-girl band.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Val knew she would regret what she was about to say. “Alright. But you’d better take care of my house and my things.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I will.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“If anything goes wrong—”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“—it won’t.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2"> </i> *</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cindy Banya arrived early, and quickly set up her drums, and began to warm up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">E. Z. Bender was next. She unpacked her guitar, fired up her amp, and began to work on a few riffs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sondra had stepped into the kitchen for a drink of water when Cindy and E. Z. suddenly went silent. She popped her head into the living room to find out why.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Boomer Hertz was standing in the doorway with her bass amp in one hand and her guitar in the other. Cindy and E. Z. were just staring at her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cindy was confused. Sondra had said this would be an all-girl band. Who was this guy in the sleeveless muscle shirt, with long, frizzy brown hair?</p>
<p class="calibre1">The 32-year-old had a stocky build. Her arms bulged, but her chest didn’t. She was clearly not somebody you wanted to mess with.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey, Boomer,” said Sondra. “Glad you could make it.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, well this had better be worth the trouble,” said Boomer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Or what? wondered Cindy. She was afraid of the answer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Boomer sat down her amp, and plugged it into an outlet. She popped the latches on her guitar case as though she were a mechanic opening a monster-sized toolbox. Then she whipped her bass out of its case, and strapped it on like King Arthur’s Excalibur.</p>
<p class="calibre1">E. Z. wouldn’t have been surprised to hear that the she-man had cut a few people down to size with the thing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sondra picked up her guitar. “Let’s warm up with Wilson Phillips’ <i class="calibre2">Impulsive</i>.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">By the end of the song, all four of the women were smiling inside, and thinking the exact same thing: We’re gonna blow ‘em away.</p>
