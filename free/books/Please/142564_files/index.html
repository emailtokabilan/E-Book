<p class="calibre1"><a id="p3"></a>by	Peter	Darbyshire</p>
<p class="calibre1">2002</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	COULDN’T	LIVE	LIKE	THAT</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	WALKED	EVERYWHERE	in	those	days.	I	had	a	car	but	I	couldn’t	always afford	gas.	Sometimes,	at	night,	I	went	up	to	the	windows	of	houses	and	looked inside.	In	the	dark,	you	can	stand	right	on	the	other	side	of	the	glass,	and	no	one ever	knows	you’re	there.	From	the	street,	these	places	always	seem	like	the	kind of	homes	you	see	in	magazine	ads,	all	red	walls	and	leather	furniture.	Close	up, though,	it’s	mostly	just	people	watching	television	or	doing	the	dishes.	Although once	I	saw	a	woman	feeding	soup	to	a	man	with	two	broken	legs.	There	was nothing	wrong	with	his	arms	but	she	fed	him	soup	anyway,	kneeling	beside	him on	the	couch	and	carefully	lifting	the	spoon	to	his	lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	time	I	saw	a	man	putting	on	eyeliner.	I	was	standing	deep	in	a	driveway between	houses	and	looking	into	a	bedroom.	I	could	see	him	through	the	cracks between	the	blinds.	He	was	sitting	at	a	vanity	with	lights	around	the	mirror. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	was	done	with	the	eyeliner	he	put	on	eye	shadow	and	lipstick.	Then	he cleaned	his	face	with	a	tissue	and	blew	himself	a	kiss.	After	that,	he	walked	out of	the	room	and	didn’t	come	back.	I	wondered	whose	makeup	it	was.	His	wife’s? </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	roommate’s? </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	once	I	came	across	another	man	doing	the	same	thing	as	me.	I	started	down a	driveway	and	saw	him	kneeling	on	the	ground	at	the	other	end,	his	face	shining from	the	light	of	the	basement	window	in	front	of	him.	He	never	looked	away from	it,	not	even	when	I	went	back	up	the	driveway.	I	don’t	think	he	ever	knew	I was	there.	I	never	went	back	to	that	house	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	twenty-three	or	twenty-four	at	the	time,	I	can’t	really	remember	anymore.	I hadn’t	worked	in	months.	My	wife	had	left	me.	Sometimes	I	woke	up	with shooting	pains	in	my	stomach,	like	someone	had	stabbed	me	while	I	slept.	The doctors	said	there	was	nothing	wrong	with	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">ON	ONE	OF	THESE	walks	I	met	a	blind	man.	It	was	around	five	or	six	in	the evening.	I	could	tell	he	was	blind	by	the	fact	that	he	wore	those	dark	glasses	and he	was	tapping	around	the	base	of	a	telephone	pole	with	a	long,	white	cane. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	tried	to	walk	around	him,	he	swung	the	cane	into	my	legs.	It	bent	like	it</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p4"></a>was	made	of	rubber.	I	had	to	stop	because	he	kept	the	cane	in	front	of	me.	I couldn’t	move	without	jumping	over	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	a	little	lost,”	he	said,	as	if	I’d	asked	him	how	he	was.	“There’s	not	a newspaper	box	around	here,	is	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	there’s	nothing	but	the	telephone	pole,”	I	told	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	supposed	to	be	a	newspaper	box,”	he	said,	“but	I	guess	my	counting	got thrown	off	somewhere.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	that’s	most	likely	it,”	I	agreed,	even	though	I	didn’t	really	know	what	he was	talking	about.	I	waited	for	him	to	move	the	cane	but	he	didn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	walking	to	the	school,”	he	went	on.	“But	I	should	have	come	across	it	by now.	You	don’t	see	a	school	anywhere,	do	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	around.	We	were	standing	in	front	of	an	old	Victorian	house	with	vines growing	up	the	front	of	it.	A	young	girl	in	white	pajamas	stood	in	the	front window,	watching	us.	There	weren’t	any	lights	on	behind	her.	She	was	just	a white	silhouette	against	the	darkness.	I	wondered	where	her	parents	were. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	I	said,	“there’s	nothing	but	houses	around	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow,”	he	said,	shaking	his	head.	“I’m	really	messed	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girl	didn’t	move	at	all,	didn’t	even	seem	to	blink.	She	looked	like	a	ghost, and	for	some	reason,	that	thought	reminded	me	of	the	last	night	I	ever	saw	my wife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	could	really	use	some	help	here,”	the	blind	man	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	BLIND	MAN	KEPT	his	free	hand	on	my	arm	while	we	walked,	as	if	he was	afraid	I	would	run	away	if	he	didn’t.	All	the	way	down	the	street,	he	tapped the	ground	in	front	of	us	with	his	cane	and	counted	under	his	breath.	Now	that	I was	taking	him	back	the	way	he	had	come,	he	seemed	to	know	exactly	where	we were	at	all	times.	Every	intersection	we	took,	he	guided	me	in	a	different direction.	Soon	I	was	the	one	who	was	lost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	it	all	memorized,”	he	told	me	as	we	went	along.	“I	go	for	the	same	walk, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p5"></a>to	the	school	and	back,	every	night.	Turn	left	out	the	door,	two	hundred	and twenty	steps	to	the	first	right,	four	hundred	and	ten	from	there…”	He	went	on like	that	for	some	time	and	then	ended	with,	“And	that	box	has	always	been there	before,	a	hundred	steps	from	the	intersection,	give	or	take,	after	the	second left	turn.	Always.	I	don’t	understand	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	do	you	know	when	you’re	actually	at	the	school?”	I	wanted	to	know.	“I mean,	even	if	you	take	the	proper	amount	of	steps,	how	do	you	know	it’s	the school	and	not	something	else,	like	a	bank	or	a	high-rise?”	I	pictured	him tapping	his	way	around	a	building,	trying	to	figure	out	what	it	was	just	by	its	size and	shape.	Maybe	counting	taps	like	he	did	steps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	hear	the	kids,”	he	told	me.	“There	are	always	kids	in	the	playground,	even in	the	middle	of	the	night.	It’s	like	they	don’t	know	where	else	to	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later,	he	said,	“You’re	probably	wondering	why	I	go	to	the	school	every	day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	not	really.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	after	any	Lolitas,	if	you	know	what	I	mean.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	don’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">HE	LED	ME	TO	a	large	house	with	a	fence	around	the	front	yard.	The	fence	was taller	than	me	and	had	trees	all	around	the	inside	of	it.	The	address	was	printed on	the	door,	in	red	paint.	It	looked	like	a	child	had	done	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here	we	are,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	do	you	have	such	a	big	fence?”	I	asked.	None	of	the	other	houses	on	the street	had	fences	around	their	front	yards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	so	no	one	can	see	us,”	he	said.	“I	think	the	neighbours	complained	or something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Us?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	kind	of	like	a	group	home,”	he	said.	“For	people	like	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pictured	a	whole	houseful	of	blind	men,	bumping	around	the	halls	and	asking</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p6"></a>each	other	for	help	just	to	get	out	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would	you	like	to	come	in?”	he	asked.	“For	a	coffee	or	something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	so,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	something	to	eat,”	he	said.	“I	can	make	you	a	sandwich.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I’ve	really	got	places	to	be,”	I	told	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	drugs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">HE	LED	ME	THROUGH	the	front	door,	which	wasn’t	locked.	As	soon	as	he opened	the	door	I	heard	a	woman	scream,	then	the	sounds	of	gunshots.	I	was ready	to	run	away,	or	maybe	hide	behind	one	of	the	trees,	but	he	walked	in	like this	was	normal,	so	I	followed	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	inside	the	entranceway	was	a	large	living	room,	and	this	was	where	all	the noise	was	coming	from.	Two	men	were	sitting	on	a	couch	underneath	the window,	watching	a	big-screen	Sony	across	the	room.	On	the	television,	some cops	in	black	body	armor	were	standing	around	a	man	lying	on	the	ground.	He was	wearing	nothing	but	shorts,	and	blood	was	running	out	of	several	bullet holes	in	his	upper	body.	A	woman	was	standing	on	the	porch	of	a	house	in	the background,	and	she	was	the	one	who	was	screaming.	I	wasn’t	entirely	sure,	but I	thought	I	might	have	seen	this	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	two	men	on	the	couch	turned	to	look	at	us	when	we	came	in,	but	they	didn’t say	anything.	One	of	them	raised	a	beer	can	to	his	lips.	“Hello,”	I	said.	They	still didn’t	say	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	mind	them,”	the	blind	man	said.	“They’re	deaf.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	looked	back	at	the	television	when	the	scene	changed	to	an	outdoors	shot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	a	bear	was	mauling	someone	on	the	other	side	of	a	parked	car.	Someone had	videotaped	the	whole	thing	rather	than	help.	The	deaf	men	started	laughing, making	noises	like	barking	dogs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	just	down	this	way,”	the	blind	man	said,	leading	me	deeper	into	the	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">FOR	A	WHILE	during	these	days	I	dated	a	woman	who	had	a	metal	arm.	It	was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a>the	first	woman	I’d	been	with	since	my	wife.	She’d	lost	her	real	arm	in	a	car accident.	She	talked	about	the	accident	like	it	didn’t	mean	anything	to	her.	“We were	going	too	fast	around	a	corner	and	the	car	rolled.	That	was	it,	just	one	of those	stupid,	one-car	accidents.”	She	never	said	who	the	other	person	was,	or which	one	of	them	was	driving.	“Silly	me,	I	had	my	arm	hanging	out	the window	and	it	got	torn	off	when	the	car	rolled	over	it.”	Silly	me.	She	really	said that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	mind	having	a	metal	arm	at	all.	Not	that	it	looked	metal.	When	you put	it	beside	her	real	arm,	you	could	barely	tell	them	apart.	But	when	you touched	this	fake	arm,	it	was	cold	and	hard.	And	it	would	move	on	its	own.	She would	take	it	off	and	lay	it	on	her	dresser,	but	the	fingers	would	twitch	for	hours afterwards,	and	sometimes	the	elbow	would	even	bend.	“It’s	just	going	to	sleep,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	told	me.	But	one	night	she	was	moving	around	and	whimpering	with	some dream,	and	the	arm	matched	all	her	movements.	It	jerked	and	shook	on	the dresser,	and	the	fingers	balled	up	into	a	fist,	and	then	the	whole	thing	fell	on	the floor.	I	wouldn’t	get	out	of	bed	the	next	morning	until	she’d	picked	it	up	and	put it	back	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	lived	in	a	basement	apartment	with	only	one	window.	We	had	to	leave	the bedroom	door	open	while	we	slept	for	fear	we’d	suffocate.	She	couldn’t	afford anything	else	because	all	she	had	was	some	sort	of	disability	pension.	She wanted	to	be	an	actress	but	she	hadn’t	worked	as	anything	but	an	extra	in	years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Who	would	hire	a	woman	with	only	one	arm? </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	liked	to	tour	condos	that	were	for	sale.	Only	the	new	ones,	though,	never anything	that	had	already	been	lived	in.	We’d	walk	through	them	and	make	notes in	a	little	notebook	we’d	bought,	talk	about	the	view,	look	in	the	cupboards.	The salespeople	acted	like	they	believed	we	could	actually	afford	these	places. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	woman	opened	a	bottle	of	wine	for	us	while	we	were	there.	She	gave	it	to	us in	little	plastic	glasses.	“I’m	sorry	about	that,”	she	said,	“but	would	you	believe someone	actually	stole	our	real	wineglasses?”	It	was	the	best	wine	I’d	ever	had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	woman	asked	us	what	we	did,	I	told	her	I	was	a	marketer	for	IBM,	and my	girlfriend	said	she	was	a	nurse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	woman	showed	us	around	the	model	suite.	When	she	brought	us	to	the living	room,	the	sun	was	just	setting,	as	if	she’d	cued	it.	The	entire	place	filled</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>with	a	golden	light,	and	I	held	my	girlfriend’s	hand	—	the	real	one	—	until	it passed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	there’s	a	Kodak	moment	if	I’ve	ever	seen	one,”	the	saleswoman	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	girlfriend	stood	in	the	middle	of	the	smaller	bedroom	and	looked	around.	It was	a	young	boy’s	room,	with	blue	walls	and	a	bed	in	the	shape	of	a	racecar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’d	want	to	paint,	of	course,”	she	said.	“When	we	have	the	children.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	expecting?”	the	saleswoman	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	no,”	my	girlfriend	said.	“But	someday.”	She	looked	at	me	and	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cheers	then,”	the	saleswoman	said	and	refilled	our	glasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	took	us	into	the	kitchen	last	and	sat	us	down	around	a	glass-topped	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	an	espresso	maker	on	the	counter	and	the	fridge	had	an	icemaker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does	the	place	come	with	all	the	appliances?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	yes,”	the	woman	said.	“And	there’s	a	pool	and	a	sauna	in	the	building.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	pool	and	a	sauna,”	I	repeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	we	don’t	have	to	pay	for	that?”	my	girlfriend	asked.	“We	can	just	use	it like	everyone	else?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	gave	us	a	blank	contract	to	look	at,	and	a	pamphlet	full	of measurements	and	costs.	I	looked	at	all	the	numbers	and	said,	“I	don’t	know.	I think	it’s	a	bit	more	than	we	wanted	to	pay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	always	is,”	she	said,	still	smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	mean,	I	don’t	know	if	we	can	afford	a	place	like	this,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	if	we	could,”	my	girlfriend	said	and	shook	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	saleswoman	poured	the	last	of	the	wine	into	our	glasses.	“The	question	you need	to	ask	yourself,”	she	said,	“is	how	can	you	afford	not	to	have	a	place	like</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">MY	GIRLFRIEND	EVENTUALLY	left	me	for	a	man	with	an	artificial	leg, someone	she’d	met	in	her	amputee	support	group.	They’d	been	having	an	affair for	months,	pretty	much	the	whole	time	I’d	been	dating	her.	She	told	me	over breakfast	one	afternoon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	we	going	to	do	now?”	I	asked,	unbelieving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	what	you’re	going	to	do,”	she	said,	watching	the	fingers	of	her fake	hand	flex	on	the	table,	“but	I	know	what	I’m	going	to	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“His	cancer	is	going	to	come	back,	you	know,”	I	told	her.	“It’s	just	growing somewhere	else	in	his	body	right	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	if	my	mind	wasn’t	made	up	about	you	before,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	day	he’s	going	to	start	having	seizures	because	of	a	brain	tumour	or something.	Where	will	you	be	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	hand	spread	itself	out	flat	on	the	table	and	was	still.	She	looked	at	me.	“I won’t	be	sitting	here	having	this	conversation	with	you,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">AFTER	THAT	I	BEGAN	spending	all	my	spare	time	in	movie	theaters.	There was	one	—	a	Cineplex	Odeon	with	eight	screens	and	Starbucks	coffee	—	that	I went	back	to	over	and	over.	It	had	air	conditioning,	and	by	the	time	I	left	my nose	would	be	running,	like	I	had	a	cold.	Whenever	one	movie	ended,	I’d	get	up and	go	to	the	next	one.	Sometimes	I’d	come	in	halfway	through	it,	sometimes	it would	be	just	beginning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once,	a	man	in	dress	pants	and	a	golf	shirt	sat	right	beside	me.	He	held	a	bag	of popcorn	between	his	legs	and	asked	me	if	I	wanted	any.	I	moved	up	several rows,	and	he	didn’t	follow	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	time	an	usher	woke	me	by	shining	a	flashlight	into	my	eyes.	“You’ve been	here	all	day,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	paid,	I	paid,”	I	told	him.	I	looked	at	the	screen,	but	it	was	blank,	the	curtain drawn.	There	was	no	one	else	in	the	theatre. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>“You	paid	for	one	show,”	he	said.	“You’ve	been	here	all	day.”	He	was	young,	a teenager,	with	slicked-back	hair	and	a	thin	moustache. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	fell	asleep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	have	to	leave	before	the	next	movie	starts.”	He	kept	shining	the	flashlight in	my	eyes,	even	though	the	house	lights	were	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	place	is	empty,”	I	said.	“What	difference	does	it	make?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	difference	is	that	you	only	paid	for	one	show.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,”	I	said.	“Help	a	man	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	really	want	me	to	get	the	manager?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">BUT	I	HAVE	TO	tell	you	about	what	happened	in	the	blind	man’s	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	smoked	a	joint	that	tasted	like	cinnamon.	He	told	me	it	was	laced	with	a	mild hallucinogen.	“It’s	the	only	way	I	can	see	these	days,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	were	sitting	on	his	bed,	and	he’d	taken	his	glasses	off.	He	was	staring	at	a spot	two	inches	over	my	head.	Now	that	I	looked	at	him	close,	I	could	see	his eyes	were	all	scarred	and	the	skin	of	his	face	pocked,	like	someone	had	taken	a small	knife	to	him.	I	was	fully	expecting	him	to	make	a	pass	at	me,	but	he	never did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	some	point	in	the	night	I	asked	him,	“What	kind	of	home	is	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	mean,	is	everyone	who	lives	here	blind	or	deaf	or	something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	yeah.	But	none	of	us	were	born	this	way,	we	were	all	normal	once.	You can’t	get	in	here	unless	you’ve	been	in	an	accident	or	something.	Like	the	deaf guys.	One	of	them	blew	his	own	eardrums	out	when	he	shot	himself	in	the head.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	shot	himself	in	the	head	and	he	didn’t	die?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	it	hit	his	skull	and	traveled	around,	went	out	the	back.	Never	even</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>touched	his	brain.	But	it	made	him	deaf	for	some	reason.	The	doctors	couldn’t explain	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	the	other	one?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know.	It	was	some	disease	or	something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jesus,”	I	said.	“I	had	no	idea	there	were	places	like	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	should	see	the	people	upstairs,”	he	said.	“Some	of	them	can’t	even	walk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	just	lie	in	their	rooms	all	day,	watching	television	and	talking	to	God,	if they	can	even	do	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	couldn’t	live	like	that,”	I	told	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	not,”	he	said,	“but	what	else	can	you	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	no	lamps	in	his	room,	but	I	could	still	see	because	there	was	light coming	in	through	the	window,	from	somewhere	close.	I	got	up	and	opened	the blinds.	The	neighbouring	house	was	only	five	or	six	feet	away.	I	was	looking into	someone’s	kitchen.	It	was	a	big	room,	with	an	island	in	the	center	and stainless-steel	pots	hanging	everywhere.	It	looked	like	an	Ikea	display.	There was	a	woman	sitting	on	the	island,	in	between	a	wooden	dish	rack	and	a	stack	of magazines.	Her	skirt	was	pulled	up	around	her	hips,	and	a	man	was	kneeling	in front	of	her,	his	head	and	one	of	his	hands	between	her	thighs.	She	was	looking right	at	me.	I	wasn’t	sure	if	they	were	really	there	or	if	I	was	just	imagining them.	Looking	back	on	it	now,	I’m	pretty	sure	I	imagined	them.	But	back	then,	I just	didn’t	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	your	neighbours	are	fucking,”	I	told	the	blind	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can	see	my	neighbours?”	He	stood	and	came	over	to	the	window,	turned his	head	from	side	to	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	kept	looking	out	her	window	but	didn’t	seem	to	notice	either	one	of us.	She	leaned	back	on	one	hand	and	ran	the	other	through	the	man’s	hair.	He had	a	bald	spot	at	the	back	of	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can	really	see	them?”	he	asked.	“Where	are	they?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>“They’re	in	the	kitchen.	They’re	fucking	right	there	on	the	counter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	me	what	they	look	like,”	the	blind	man	said.	He	had	his	hand	on	my	arm again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	looks	like	the	kind	of	woman	you’d	see	on	television,”	I	said.	“I	don’t know	about	him.	I	can’t	see	his	face	because	he’s	going	down	on	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?”	He	leaned	forward,	until	his	nose	touched	the	glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	got	her	legs	wrapped	around	his	shoulders	and	everything,”	I	told	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow.	What	are	her	tits	like?	Are	they	big?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,	she’s	still	dressed.	She’s	just	pulled	up	her	skirt.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	what	do	they	look	like?	Do	they	look	big?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	all	right,	I	guess.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	her	panties?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know.	I	can’t	see	them.	Maybe	she	wasn’t	wearing	any.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	her	skirt?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	a	red	floral	thing.	And	a	white	shirt.	Some	sort	of	silk	material.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	yeah,”	he	said.	“I	can	see	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	two	of	us	stood	there	in	silence	for	a	moment,	me	watching	this	couple having	sex,	the	blind	guy	staring	in	their	direction	and	not	seeing	anything,	or maybe	seeing	something	only	he	could	see,	and	the	woman	staring	back	at	us.	If she	was	even	there	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	closed	her	eyes	when	she	came.	From	this	close,	I	could	see	the	flush	to	her skin.	The	man	stood	up	and	grabbed	a	dishtowel	from	the	counter,	wiped	his	face with	it.	She	hit	him	lightly	on	the	shoulder	and	laughed	as	she	hopped	off	the counter.	They	went	out	of	the	kitchen	and	didn’t	come	back	again.	I	never	did see	the	man’s	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>“Tell	me	what	they’re	doing	now,”	the	blind	man	said	when	they	were	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">COULD	I	AFFORD	YOU? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>By	Peter	Darbyshire</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	WAS	SITTING	BESIDE	an	actor.	We	were	talking	to	each	other’s	reflections in	the	mirror	behind	the	bar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	had	an	audition	today,”	he	told	me.	“They’re	going	to	pay	me	ten	thousand dollars	to	be	a	body	double.”	He	shook	his	head	like	he	was	disappointed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	it,	some	kind	of	stunt?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	it’s	for	this	sex	scene.	You	don’t	even	get	to	see	my	face.”	He	sipped	his drink,	some	sort	of	martini,	and	sighed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bar	was	empty	except	for	us	and	the	one	waitress	working.	It	was	two	in	the afternoon.	He’d	walked	in	and	sat	on	the	stool	beside	me,	started	talking	like	he was	a	friend	of	mine.	He’d	even	bought	me	a	beer.	For	that	I	had	to	listen	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	should	have	seen	the	audition,”	he	went	on.	“I	thought	it	would	be something	personal,	you	know?	Maybe	me	and	the	director	in	some	locked	room somewhere.	A	lot	of	talk	about	motivation	and	that	kind	of	thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Something	intimate,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly.	Only	it	was	nine	fucking	a.m.	in	this	bright	office,	and	there	were	two other	people	in	there	with	him.	The	director	of	photography	and	some	woman lawyer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why’d	they	have	a	lawyer	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know.	Something	to	do	with	lawsuits.	Anyway,	the	audition	consisted	of me	having	to	act	the	scene	out.	Only	they	made	me	do	it	with	this	blow-up	doll instead	of	with	a	real	person.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	fucked	a	doll?	With	other	people	in	the	room?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	no,	I	didn’t	fuck	it.	I	acted	like	I	was	making	love	to	it.	It	was	an	audition, remember?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	I	said,	“I	don’t	think	I	could	have	done	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>“Oh,	it	wasn’t	so	bad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Was	it	one	of	those	lifelike	dolls?”	I	asked.	“The	kind	with	the	holes	and everything?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	missing	the	point	here,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">WHEN	I	WASN’T	working,	I	spent	most	of	my	time	at	The	Code.	It	was	one	of those	underground	bars,	the	kind	that	no	matter	when	you	leave,	you’re	always walking	up	into	the	light.	The	walls	were	covered	in	old	movie	posters.	Bogart, Dean,	Hepburn.	It	was	always	filled	with	beautiful	people.	There	was	some	sort of	modeling	studio	in	the	building	upstairs	and	a	Club	Monaco	across	the	street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	actor	told	me	that	all	the	movie	stars	drank	there	when	they	were	in	town.	It was	like	I	was	living	in	L.A.	or	someplace	like	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	waitresses	got	to	know	me	by	name.	They	never	charged	me	for	more	than six	or	seven	drinks.	One	of	them	-	she	was	Indian	or	Asian,	I	couldn’t	really	tell	-</p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted	to	be	a	model,	but	she	had	a	lazy	eye,	so	she	was	never	going	to	get	any work.	She	called	herself	Mercedes,	but	I	didn’t	think	that	was	her	real	name.	I was	in	love	with	her	even	though	she	was	going	out	with	the	actor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	night	she	sat	with	me	at	the	bar	after	her	shift	was	done.	There	was	a	man	in a	leather	body	suit	a	few	stools	down,	drinking	a	Scotch.	We	all	watched	one	of those	medical	shows	on	television.	A	team	of	surgeons	was	operating	on	a	baby still	in	the	womb.	They	cut	open	the	mother	and	then	cut	open	the	baby	inside her.	They	were	playing	Vivaldi	in	the	operating	room	to	keep	the	patients	calm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	something	wrong	with	the	baby’s	spine,	but	the	announcer	said	it would	be	okay	after	the	surgery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Imagine	that,”	I	said.	“If	someone	fixed	all	your	problems	before	you	were born.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	wouldn’t	she	just	abort	it	and	try	again?”	Mercedes	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	think	about	it,”	I	told	her.	“What	if	someone	had	fixed	your	eye	before anyone	else	had	a	chance	to	see	it?	Where	would	you	be	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	lit	a	cigarette	and	looked	at	me	through	the	smoke.	“Why	is	it	that	you	never go	home?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>“What	would	I	do	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	do	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	back	to	the	television.	“The	important	thing,”	I	said,	“is	that	the	baby	is all	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	some	point	in	the	night	-	I	don’t	remember	if	it	was	before	or	after	the	surgery show	-	the	man	in	the	leather	suit	came	over	to	us.	“Would	you	like	to	come	into the	back	room	with	me?”	he	asked	Mercedes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	so,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	have	to	do	anything,”	he	said.	“You	can	just	watch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,”	I	said,	but	neither	one	looked	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	a	boyfriend,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bring	him	along.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does	your	wife	know	you	do	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Married?	I’m	not	married.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	see	the	ring	mark	on	your	finger.”	It	was	true	-	there	was	a	thin	band	of scar	tissue	around	his	ring	finger,	as	if	he’d	been	married	for	years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Divorced,”	he	said.	“I	can’t	even	remember	her	name.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	what	they	all	say,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	about	if	I	pay	you?”	he	asked.	“Just	to	watch,	like	I	said.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	couldn’t	afford	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	you?”	he	said,	looking	at	me	for	the	first	time.	“Could	I	afford you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	CODE	HAD	a	room	in	the	back	that	was	only	for	special	events.	The	walls were	painted	black,	and	all	the	furniture	was	covered	in	white	sheets.	There	were</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>no	windows.	When	there	wasn’t	an	event	taking	place,	you	could	only	get	in with	a	key	that	was	kept	behind	the	bar.	Sometimes	the	lights	inside	were	red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every	Monday	there	was	a	fetish	party	in	the	room.	All	night	long	people	would walk	in	wearing	leather	or	latex	or	even	plastic.	Sometimes	men	would	show	up in	heels	or	fishnet	stockings.	Women	with	safety	pins	in	their	cheeks	and	arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	I	saw	a	man	leading	a	woman	by	a	chain	tied	around	her	neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	mainly	it	was	normal	people,	people	in	suits	or	dressed	like	you	and	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	came	in	and	had	a	drink	or	two	at	the	counter	and	then	changed	in	the washroom.	When	they	came	out	they’d	be	wearing	handcuffs	or	corsets	or sometimes	just	leather	underwear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wanted	to	look	inside,	to	see	what	they	did	in	there,	but	you	had	to	pay	ten dollars	at	the	door.	The	man	who’d	asked	Mercedes	to	go	back	there	ran	the parties	and	he	stood	outside	the	door	most	of	the	night	with	a	little	cash	box. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	the	people	inside	all	laughed	and	shouted	at	each	other	like	they	belonged there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once,	though,	no	one	at	all	showed	up.	It	was	raining	so	hard	a	storm	sewer outside	had	overflowed,	and	water	was	trickling	down	the	stairs	into	The	Code. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mercedes	was	out	with	the	actor.	He’d	picked	her	up	after	work,	and	the	two	of them	had	gone	up	into	the	storm,	leaving	me	alone	at	the	bar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	the	man	who	ran	the	fetish	nights	-	he	later	told	me	his	name	was Christopher,	“like	the	saint”	-	was	sitting	beside	me,	drinking	another	Scotch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	time	he	wore	leather	pants	with	a	mesh	shirt	that	had	no	back.	I	could	see his	pierced	nipples	through	the	shirt.	We	were	watching	the	television	above	the bar,	but	something	was	wrong	with	it	-	it	kept	flipping	channels	on	its	own, every	few	seconds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	come	you	haven’t	come	to	any	of	the	parties	yet?”	Christopher	wanted	to know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	really	my	scene,”	I	told	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	know	until	you	try,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>The	television	finally	seemed	to	settle	on	the	Discovery	Channel,	but	then	the screen	went	dead	as	the	power	went	out.	There	was	only	the	light	of	the	candles to	see	by.	I	waited	for	the	power	to	come	back	up	but	it	didn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Someone	must	have	hit	a	line	somewhere,”	Christopher	said.	“We’ll	probably be	this	way	for	a	while.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	about	going	home	and	looked	out	the	front	door.	It	was	raining	harder than	before.	I	didn’t	even	own	an	umbrella. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	could	go	back	there	now,”	he	said.	“While	we’re	waiting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pulled	a	couple	of	candles	closer	and	didn’t	say	anything,	just	looked	up	at	the dead	television. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	won’t	even	charge	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	AIR	IN	THE	back	room	smelled	like	it	had	been	in	there	for	years.	All	the couches	and	chairs	had	been	pulled	up	against	the	walls,	and	the	fetish	gear filled	the	center	of	the	room.	There	were	large	wooden	crosses	you	tied	people to,	and	benches	for	kneeling	on,	and	padded	handcuffs	hanging	from	the	ceiling beams. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Try	anything	you	want,”	Christopher	said.	He	leaned	against	one	of	the	crosses and	watched	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	just	looking,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	more	in	the	corner,”	he	said,	pointing	at	a	stack	of	boxes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	everything	inside	them	-	crumpled	leather	gloves,	plastic	balls	with straps	attached,	wooden	paddles.	I	put	on	a	zippered	face	mask	with	no	mouth hole,	only	openings	for	the	nose	and	eyes.	It	tasted	of	salt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	you,”	Christopher	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	box	held	a	collection	of	whips.	I	pulled	up	the	mask	so	I	could	speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	these	for?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	think	they’re	for?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>I	took	out	a	short	whip	with	a	dozen	leather	straps	the	length	of	my	forearm	and snapped	it	through	the	air	a	couple	of	times.	“You	don’t	actually	hit	each	other with	these	things,	do	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	don’t	you	give	it	a	try?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	so,”	I	said.	“I’m	not	that	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	once,”	he	said.	“You	might	like	it.”	He	turned	around	and	spread	himself against	the	rack.	The	bare	skin	of	his	back	looked	golden	in	the	candlelight.	I walked	up	behind	him	but	didn’t	do	anything.	“I	can’t,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	mind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	hit	him	with	the	whip	as	hard	as	I	could.	It	made	the	same	kind	of	noise	as punches	do	in	movies.	I	was	surprised	to	see	blood	on	his	skin	right	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jesus	Christ!”	He	jumped	away	from	me	and	stumbled	over	one	of	the	benches, fell	to	the	floor.	“You	fucking	maniac!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	I	asked.	“You	said	I	could.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	that	fucking	hard,”	he	shouted.	He	felt	around	behind	his	back	and	then showed	me	his	bloody	fingertips.	“Look	at	that!	I’m	going	to	need	a	doctor now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	they	have	a	first-aid	kit	here,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	the	fuck	is	wrong	with	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	isn’t	this	what	you	all	do	in	here?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	only	waitress	working	came	to	the	door	and	stopped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	know	where	the	first-aid	kit	is?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	at	me	standing	there	with	the	whip	and	the	mask,	looked	at Christopher	writhing	on	the	floor,	and	then	she	closed	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">SOMETIMES	THE	PEOPLE	from	the	modeling	studio	upstairs	used	the	room for	shoots.	It	would	always	be	one	man	-	the	photographer	-	and	a	group	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>women.	They’d	come	in	and	get	the	key	from	whatever	waitress	was	working and	lock	themselves	in	there.	Sometimes	they	wouldn’t	come	out	for	hours.	I imagined	them	having	sex	in	there,	on	the	couches	or	maybe	on	piles	of	the clothes	they	brought	in	with	them,	like	a	scene	out	of	some	movie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	night	I	helped	with	a	shoot.	A	photographer	came	in	with	three	models	from upstairs.	None	of	the	women	looked	over	eighteen,	but	one	of	them	paid	for	a round	of	drinks	with	a	gold	card.	They	sat	at	the	booth	underneath	the	Hepburn poster	and	smoked	cigars	all	night	long.	They	were	sitting	in	the	No	Smoking section,	but	the	waitress	working	that	night	-	a	new	woman	I	didn’t	know,	who charged	me	full	price	for	the	drinks	-	never	said	anything	to	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Around	midnight,	the	photographer	came	over	to	the	bar,	where	I’d	been	sitting all	night.	“You	work	here?”	he	asked.	I	looked	around	for	the	waitress,	but	she was	nowhere	in	sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,”	I	said.	“I	work	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	ready	for	the	back	room	now,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wasn’t	exactly	sure	what	he	meant,	but	I	went	around	the	counter	and	got	the key	anyway.	When	I	opened	the	door,	the	models	all	wandered	into	the	room	and sat	down	on	the	furniture	there.	Each	of	them	carried	a	couple	of	garment	bags that	they	dropped	to	the	floor	once	they	were	inside.	“I	could	use	a	glass	of water,”	one	of	them	said.	She	held	her	foot	up	to	look	at	her	toenails.	I	went	back to	the	bar	and	poured	some	water	into	a	glass,	threw	a	lemon	slice	from	a	bowl into	it,	and	brought	it	to	her.	She	took	it	without	saying	thanks	or	even	looking	at me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	photographer	had	taken	the	sheets	off	the	fetish	equipment	and	was	looking at	it	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	need	this	stuff	brought	out	and,	um,	arranged,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right.”	I	dragged	the	wooden	crosses	out	to	where	he	pointed	and	turned them	around	under	the	lights	until	he	told	me	to	stop.	The	models	watched	in silence.	One	of	them	fell	asleep	for	a	while. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	enough,”	the	photographer	eventually	said	to	me.	I	let	go	of	the aluminum	cage	I’d	pushed	out	of	one	of	the	corners	and	stood	next	to	him,	like	I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>was	his	assistant	or	something.	“Why	don’t	we	start	with	that	black	vest	thing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	said	to	one	of	the	women. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded	and	stood	up,	started	to	take	off	her	shirt.	She	had	on	a	black	lace bra	underneath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	kind	of	shoot	is	this?”	I	asked.	I	imagined	seeing	this	room	and	these models	on	bus	ads,	or	maybe	even	billboards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	nothing	like	that,”	the	photographer	said.	“These	are	just,	ah,	audition photos.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	model	opened	up	one	of	the	garment	bags	and	took	out	a	sleeveless	leather vest,	put	it	on.	It	zipped	up	to	her	throat.	The	photographer	pushed	her	against one	of	the	crosses.	“Could	you	hold	her	hands?”	he	asked.	I	thought	he	meant me	and	I	started	to	step	forward,	but	he	was	talking	to	one	of	the	other	models. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	walked	around	behind	the	cross	and	held	the	first	one’s	wrists.	The	third	one took	a	cell	phone	out	of	her	pocket	and	started	talking	on	it.	“I	won’t	be	making class	tomorrow,”	she	said.	“Can	you	take	notes	for	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	one	of	those	balls	in	her	mouth,”	the	photographer	said,	and	this	time	he looked	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	over	to	the	boxes	and	searched	through	them	until	I	found	what	he wanted,	a	red	plastic	ball	with	a	leather	head	strap	attached.	“You	want	me	to	put it	on	her?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	then	the	waitress	came	in.	“What	are	you	doing	in	here?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	working,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	talking	about?”	she	asked.	“You	don’t	work	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	looked	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	just	for	tonight,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	she	said,	“you	don’t	work	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	photographer	took	the	mouthpiece	from	my	hands.	“Maybe	you	should	lock</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>the	door,”	he	said	to	the	waitress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	come	on,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">NOW	IT	WAS	THE	day	after	that	incident	and	I	was	sitting	alone	at	the	bar again,	watching	television.	Someone	drove	a	Volvo	off	a	cliff.	A	group	of	men and	women	in	white	lab	coats	watched.	The	sky	was	a	shade	of	blue	I’d	never seen	before.	There	was	a	quick	close-up	of	the	driver	of	the	car,	screaming	as	it fell	down	toward	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t	that	your	boyfriend?”	I	asked	Mercedes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	have	a	boyfriend,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	camera	cut	to	the	wrecked	car	at	the	bottom	of	the	cliff.	It	looked	like	it	had been	run	through	a	crusher.	Then	the	door	opened	and	the	driver	stepped	out, waved	at	the	men	and	women	in	lab	coats.	The	Volvo	logo	appeared	on	the screen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	that’s	your	boyfriend,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	at	the	television.	“I	don’t	know	who	that	is,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">BUT	HE	CAME	in	that	very	afternoon.	He	stood	beside	me	and	leaned	against the	bar.	He	was	wearing	a	silver	Rolex	that	looked	new.	Mercedes	was	sitting	at the	end	of	the	bar,	smoking	a	cigarette	and	reading	a	Vogue.	“What	do	you want?”	she	asked	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	want	my	videos	back,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	the	ones	I’m	in,”	she	said.	“No	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	want	those,”	he	said.	“I	want	the	films.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine.	You	can	have	those.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	I	can	have	them.	They’re	mine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	drop	them	off	on	the	weekend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right.”	He	sat	down	beside	me	and	tossed	a	gold	card	on	the	counter.	“In	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>meantime	I	want	a	latte.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	serving	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	at	his	reflection	in	the	mirror.	“I	want	a	latte.	With	cinnamon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	hear	that?”	Mercedes	said	to	me.	“He	wants	a	latte.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	hear	anything,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	to	look	at	me.	“Who	the	fuck	are	you,”	he	asked,	“to	talk	to	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	Mercedes,	but	she	just	kept	on	reading	the	Vogue.	I	reached	behind the	counter	and	grabbed	the	key,	went	to	the	back	room.	I	emptied	the	boxes onto	the	floor	until	I	found	one	of	the	whips.	Then	I	went	back	into	the	main room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mercedes	and	the	actor	both	laughed	when	they	saw	me.	“What	do	you	think you’re	going	to	do	with	that?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stopped	behind	him.	“The	lady	asked	you	to	leave,”	I	said,	meeting	his	gaze	in the	mirror. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,”	Mercedes	said.	“I	think	this	has	gone	far	enough.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	this	what	you’ve	been	reduced	to?”	the	actor	asked,	looking	at	her.	“The lady?	You	sorry	cunt.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	hit	him	with	the	whip.	I	was	careful	not	to	hit	him	hard,	but	the	leather	straps still	made	a	sound	like	a	slap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,”	he	said.	He	covered	his	face	with	his	hands,	even	though	I	hit	him	on	the back.	“Hey	hey	hey	hey!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	kept	hitting	him.	He	got	off	the	stool	and	ran	toward	the	door,	and	I	followed him.	Mercedes	was	laughing	even	harder	now,	and	I	started	laughing	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who’s	the	cunt	now?”	I	asked.	“Huh?	Who’s	the	cunt	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	RAIN	HAD	FINALLY	stopped,	and	now	I	was	sitting	beside	a	table	of three	women	who	looked	like	secretaries.	One	of	them	was	wearing	a	red	silk</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>blindfold,	even	though	it	wasn’t	a	fetish	night.	A	sign	made	of	red	construction paper	hung	from	a	string	around	her	neck.	It	said,	Kiss	Me,	I’m	Getting	Married. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	others	already	wore	wedding	bands.	There	was	no	one	else	in	the	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mercedes	had	stopped	coming	to	work.	I	went	to	The	Code	every	day	for	a week,	sometimes	staying	six	or	eight	hours,	but	she	never	showed	up	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">None	of	the	other	waitresses	knew	what	had	happened	to	her.	That’s	what	they told	me,	anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	are	you	getting	married?”	I	asked	the	blindfolded	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Next	month,”	one	of	the	other	women	said.	She	had	blond	hair	that	was	black	at the	roots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	you’ve	got	plenty	of	time	to	live	a	little	then.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	what	we’re	doing,”	the	blond-haired	woman	said.	They	were	all	smiling and	pushing	their	gold	bracelets	up	and	down	their	arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	what	I	mean,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	we	don’t,”	she	said,	but	she	was	laughing	when	she	said	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	over	to	the	bar	and	ordered	a	round	of	martinis	from	the	waitress,	the	one who	charged	me	full	price	for	everything.	“Put	it	on	my	tab,”	I	told	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	have	a	tab,”	she	said.	“But	I	can	put	it	on	your	bill.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’ll	be	fine,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	are	you	going	to	pay	for	all	this?”	she	asked	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	three	credit	cards,”	I	told	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	you	should	give	me	one	now.	Just	to	make	sure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back	at	the	table,	I	asked	the	blindfolded	woman	what	her	husband	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	not	married	yet,”	she	said.	It	was	the	first	time	I’d	heard	her	speak.	She sounded	like	she’d	been	drinking	for	some	time	before	they	came	in	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>“What’s	your	boyfriend	do	then?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	a	lawyer,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	corporate	lawyer,”	the	blond-haired	woman	put	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	lawyer?”	I	said.	“That	the	best	you	can	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	you?”	the	third	woman	asked.	She	had	a	huge	purple	blemish	on her	cheek,	like	she’d	been	burned	or	punched	hard.	“What	do	you	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me?	I’m	a	doctor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	doctor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	your	specialty,	doc?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	fix	kids.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	martinis	came,	the	two	women	who	could	see	just	stared	at	them.	“We didn’t	order	these,”	the	blond-haired	woman	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	they?”	the	blindfolded	woman	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	from	him,”	the	waitress	said,	nodding	in	my	direction.	The	secretaries all	turned	their	heads	my	way	for	a	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To	marriage,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	sipped	the	martinis	and	started	talking	about	something	to	do	with	the wedding	-	the	colour	of	the	dresses	or	the	flowers	or	something	like	that.	I	got	up and	went	to	the	washroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	came	out,	only	the	blindfolded	woman	was	sitting	at	the	table,	alone with	the	half-finished	martinis.	The	others	were	at	the	bar,	ordering	more	drinks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stopped	and	stood	beside	their	table	for	a	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	blindfolded	woman	turned	her	head	in	my	direction,	like	she	sensed	me there.	I	bent	down	beside	her.	She	licked	her	lips,	flattened	her	hands	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>table.	For	a	moment	I	just	looked	at	her,	watching	the	way	she	strained	against the	silk	covering	her	eyes.	Then	I	kissed	her	gently,	just	brushing	my	lips	against hers.	I	could	taste	mint	on	her	breath.	She	put	her	hand	on	my	chest.	We	only went	on	that	way	for	a	second	or	two,	but	it	was	like	we	had	been	lovers	for years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THIS	ISN’T	WHAT	I	WANTED</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>By	Peter	Darbyshire</p>
<p class="calibre1">DURING	SOME	OF	THIS	TIME,	I	worked	in	a	call	center.	It	was	the	kind	of place	you	see	on	television	-	all	pink	cubicles	and	windowless	walls.	I	worked the	night	shift,	taking	roadside	assistance	calls.	It	was	the	only	job	the	temp agency	could	find	for	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People	phoned	me	for	help	all	night	long.	The	woman	who	trained	me	-	an	older woman	who	wore	bifocals	and	whose	name	was	actually	Hope	-	told	me	to always	act	like	I	cared	about	their	problems.	“Ask	them	if	they’re	all	right	first,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	said.	“Then	make	sure	their	membership	is	still	valid.”	She	told	me	she’d been	a	social	worker	before	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	what	if	their	membership’s	not	valid?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	you	don’t	have	to	pretend	to	care	anymore,”	she	said.	“Get	them	off	the line.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	what	if	they’re	in	real	trouble?”	I	wanted	to	know.	“What	if	they’re	lying	in a	ditch	somewhere,	pinned	inside	the	car	while	water	rises	all	around	them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	you’re	the	last	person	they	should	be	calling	for	help,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">BUT	SOMETIMES	PEOPLE	did	call	when	they	were	in	real	trouble.	Once,	a woman	started	screaming	that	she	was	on	fire	before	I	could	even	say	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	all	right?”	I	asked,	remembering	what	Hope	had	told	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	just	said	I’m	on	fire,”	she	shrieked.	“Does	that	sound	all	right	to	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	part	of	you	is	on	fire?”	I	asked.	“Is	it	your	clothes?	If	it’s	your	clothes, just	take	them	off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	car,”	she	said.	“My	car	is	on	fire.”	I	could	hear	a	horn	go	off	in	the background,	and	what	sounded	like	a	child’s	laughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shouldn’t	you	be	calling	911	or	someone	like	that?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	did,	I	did,”	she	said.	“But	I	need	all	the	help	I	can	get	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>“All	right,”	I	said.	“I	just	need	your	membership	number.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	membership	number?”	I	could	hear	a	car	alarm	going	off	now.	“It’s	…</p>
<p class="calibre1">Don’t	you	even	want	to	know	where	I	am?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	need	the	number	first,”	I	told	her.	“I	have	to	enter	everything	into	the computer	in	the	right	order.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	car	is	on	fire,”	she	shouted,	“and	you’re	talking	to	me	about	order?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	nothing	I	can	do,”	I	told	her.	“It’s	the	system.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	voice	faded.	“Don’t	worry	about	the	damned	groceries,”	I	heard	her	yell	at someone.	“The	car	is	going	to	blow	up!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	cars	actually	blow	up,”	I	said.	“I	think	that’s	only	in	the	movies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	saying?”	she	asked,	back	now.	“Are	you	telling	me	my	car	is	not blowing	up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	just	saying	I	think	that’s	only	in	the	movies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wish	this	was	a	movie.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">MOSTLY,	THOUGH,	it	was	just	sending	out	tow	trucks	for	cars	with	dead batteries	or	empty	gas	tanks.	During	storms,	the	calls	were	back	to	back,	all night	long.	I	couldn’t	take	a	break	until	it	slowed	down,	because	the	system automatically	routed	waiting	calls	to	me.	When	I	did	get	a	break,	I	had	to	sign out	of	my	computer.	The	router	stopped	sending	me	calls	for	exactly	ten minutes,	after	which	it	started	up	again	whether	I	was	in	my	cubicle	or	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once,	I	came	back	to	my	cubicle	late	and	found	the	phone	ringing	and	my supervisor,	Adam,	sitting	in	my	chair,	feet	up	on	the	desk.	His	eyes	were	closed, and	he	was	wearing	a	special	headset	that	let	him	listen	to	anyone’s	call	without them	knowing.	He	was	twenty-two	but	already	going	bald. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	what	you	did	before	this,”	he	told	me,	still	not	opening	his	eyes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“but	you	can’t	do	it	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	only	two	minutes	late,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>“Every	time	you’re	late,	you	get	docked	an	hour’s	pay.	It’s	automatic.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	not	really	fair,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	only	opened	his	eyes	when	he	got	out	of	my	chair	and	stretched.	His	back made	cracking	noises,	and	I	could	hear	distant	voices	coming	from	his	headset. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	has	nothing	to	do	with	fair,”	he	said.	“It	has	to	do	with	the	system.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">NONE	OF	THE	CALLERS	knew	we	could	listen	to	them	when	we	put	them	on hold.	Sometimes	I	did	it	just	to	hear	what	they	would	say.	Once	I	heard	a	man with	a	dead	battery	threaten	his	girlfriend.	“When	we	get	out	of	this,”	he	said,	“I am	going	to	fuck	you	up	so	bad.”	I	could	hear	her	laugh	in	the	background. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	he	said,	“I	mean	it.”	But	she	kept	on	laughing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	man,	this	one	with	a	flat	tire,	seemed	to	be	having	sex	with	someone.	As soon	as	I	put	him	on	hold	he	started	moaning.	“Mmm,”	he	said,	“God!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	came	back	on	the	line.	“Everything	all	right?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everything	except	the	car,”	he	said,	his	voice	back	to	normal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	checking,”	I	said	and	put	him	on	hold	once	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	stop,”	he	groaned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">AND	I	HAD	a	regular	caller,	a	man	named	Jude.	The	first	time	he	called,	he	told me	he’d	run	out	of	gas.	The	info	on	the	computer	said	he	was	from	Yellowknife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How’s	the	weather	up	there?”	I	asked	him	as	I	filled	in	the	forms	on	the	screen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hope	said	to	always	keep	people	talking.	If	they	were	talking,	they	weren’t wondering	what	you	were	doing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	it’s	not	so	bad,”	Jude	said.	“No	worse	than	usual,	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	up	at	the	television	mounted	in	one	corner	of	the	office.	It	was	always tuned	to	one	of	the	weather	channels,	and	right	now	it	was	showing	the	entire state	covered	in	a	snowstorm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	long	do	you	think	it’ll	take	to	get	someone	out	here?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>“Depends	on	how	many	other	people	are	broken	down,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	I	need	to	find	my	girlfriend,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	you	should	call	her	and	let	her	know	you’re	going	to	be	late,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	no,”	he	said,	“I	have	to	find	her.	She	hasn’t	been	home	in	two	days,	and	I really	don’t	know	where	she	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	that’s	not	really	our	business,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	what	to	do,”	he	went	on.	“She’s	usually	only	gone	the	night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have	you	tried	calling	the	police?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	police.”	He	laughed.	“What	are	they	going	to	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	finished	the	forms	and	asked	him	where	to	send	the	driver	with	the	gas.	He gave	me	the	address,	and	I	paused	as	I	looked	at	the	screen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t	that	your	home	address?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	right,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	ran	out	of	gas	at	home?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	technically	it	happened	down	the	street	a	bit,”	he	said,	“but	I	managed	to get	her	back	in	the	driveway	before	she	really	gave	out	on	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	there	anything	else	I	can	help	you	with?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	he	said.	There	was	a	silence,	like	he	was	waiting	for	me	to	say something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	good	luck	with	this	girlfriend	thing,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	luck	I	need,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">HOPE	SAT	IN	THE	cubicle	next	to	mine.	Every	shift	she	received	an	obscene call.	“It’s	always	the	same	guy,”	she	told	me	one	night	while	we	were	waiting	for the	computers	to	come	back	up	after	a	system	crash.	“He	never	says	anything, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>but	I	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	can	you	tell	it’s	him	if	he	doesn’t	say	anything?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	always	comes	at	the	same	time,”	she	said.	She	tapped	her	watch.	“Sixty seconds,	that’s	all	it	takes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	comes	when	he’s	talking	to	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	tell	by	the	breathing,”	she	said.	“You	know,	it	starts	off	slow	and	quiet, and	then,	wham,	it’s	like	he’s	dying.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you	listen	to	this?”	I	asked.	“Why	don’t	you	disconnect?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shrugged.	“It’s	only	sixty	seconds	out	of	my	day,”	she	said.	“And	it’s	a	break from	the	regular	type	of	calls.”	She	leaned	back	in	her	chair	and	folded	her	hands on	her	lap,	stared	at	her	blank	screen.	“But	I	can’t	tell	you	how	glad	I	am	I wasn’t	born	with	a	penis.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once,	she	let	me	listen	to	him.	I’d	just	come	back	from	a	break,	and	she	waved me	over.	I	plugged	my	headset	into	the	extra	jack	on	her	phone	base	in	time	to hear	this	man	gasping	like	he	was	running	a	marathon	or	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello?”	Hope	said.	“Is	anyone	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	made	choking	noises. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	I	help	you?”	Hope	asked,	smiling	at	me.	He	let	out	a	long	sigh,	and	she pointed	at	her	watch.	“Hello?”	she	said	again	and	kept	repeating	it	until	we	heard the	dial	tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	unplugged	my	headset	from	her	phone.	“How	does	he	keep	getting	you?”	I asked.	“I	thought	the	calls	were	all	routed	automatically.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	are,”	she	said.	“So	I	don’t	think	it’s	coming	from	outside.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	mean?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	someone	in	here,”	she	said,	looking	around	the	room.	There	were	maybe	a dozen	men	scattered	around	the	cubicles.	“But	at	least	now	I	know	it’s	not	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>I	ONLY	RECEIVED	one	obscene	call	during	the	time	I	was	there.	It	was	around three	or	four	in	the	morning,	the	quiet	time.	“Bitch,”	the	man	whispered	after	I answered.	“Slut.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,”	I	said.	“You’re	talking	to	a	man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	me	what	you’re	wearing,”	he	went	on.	“I	want	to	know	what	you	look like.”	I	could	hear	soft	slapping	noises	in	the	background. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	got	an	obscene	call,”	I	said	to	Hope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	my	guy,	is	it?”	she	asked,	frowning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Put	me	on	the	speaker	phone,”	he	gasped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	this	one	talks,”	I	told	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	cunt,”	he	sobbed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	if	someone	was	really	in	trouble?”	I	said	to	him.	“What	if	their	car	was	on fire	and	they	were	trying	to	call	right	now,	but	couldn’t	get	through	because	of you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	it,”	he	moaned	and	came. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JUDE	CALLED	ME	two	more	times.	The	first	time,	his	voice	was	low	and thick,	as	if	he	was	thinking	about	each	word.	“I	was	hoping	you	were	working tonight,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	did	you	get	me	again?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	just	kept	trying	until	you	answered,”	he	said.	“It	only	took	three	times.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	me?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	we	developed	a	rapport	the	other	night,”	he	said.	He	pronounced	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">“t”	in	“rapport.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	what	can	I	do	for	you	this	time?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dead	battery,”	he	said.	“I	need	a	boost.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>“Your	car	in	the	driveway	again?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	a	truck,”	he	said.	“And	yeah,	it	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,”	I	said.	I	started	on	the	forms.	“How’s	the	weather	tonight?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	getting	worse,”	he	said.	“I	don’t	think	I’m	going	to	be	able	to	make	it	to work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	up	at	the	television.	The	weather	channel	was	predicting	sunshine	for Yellowknife	all	week. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	I’ll	send	someone	right	away,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’d	be	great,”	he	said.	There	was	a	sound	like	ice	clinking	in	a	glass,	and then	he	said,	“I	couldn’t	find	her.	She	still	hasn’t	come	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	hasn’t	come	back?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	girlfriend,”	he	said.	“It’s	been	a	week	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	this	is	something	I	can	help	you	with,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	she	did	call,”	he	went	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	what	more	do	you	want?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	doesn’t	think	it’s	working	out	between	us,”	he	said.	“Now	what	am	I supposed	to	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have	you	tried	asking	her	what	the	problem	is?”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	yeah,”	he	said.	“She	said	she	wasn’t	really	sure.	It	was	just	a	feeling	she had.	What	am	I	supposed	to	say	to	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	it’s	time	to	move	on,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	can’t	do	that,”	he	said.	“I	just	to	need	to	repair	this,	uh,	situation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	see	why	you’re	telling	me	all	of	this,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>“You	talk	to	people	all	the	time	for	your	job,	right?”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes	…”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	you’re	good	with	communicating.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	mainly	dispatch	tow	trucks,”	I	told	him.	“That	doesn’t	require	too	much communication.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you	help	people,”	he	said.	“That’s	exactly	the	combination	I	need.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	understand,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	get	her	back	here,”	he	said,	“and	we’ll	call	you.	Then	you	can	talk	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	you’ll	fix	everything	for	us.	Right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	say	anything	for	a	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right?”	he	said	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll	take	care	of	us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	take	care	of	you,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	call	was	done,	Adam	came	on	the	line.	“What,”	he	said,	“was	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	around	but	couldn’t	see	him	anywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	a	call	center,”	he	said,	“not	a	distress	line.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	could	I	do?”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	could	have	told	him	to	call	back	only	if	had	a	real	problem.	You	could	have not	said	you’d	help	him	talk	to	his	girlfriend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	was	just	to	get	rid	of	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	he	does	call	back,	I	want	you	to	hang	up	on	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>“All	right,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or	we’ll	be	hanging	up	on	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">AND	ONCE	I	HAD	a	suicide	call.	Before	I	could	even	say	anything,	the	woman on	the	other	end	said,	“I’m	going	to	kill	myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	have	the	wrong	number,”	I	told	her.	“This	is	for	people	whose	cars	have broken	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sitting	in	my	car,”	she	said.	“I’ve	got	a	knife.	And	a	whole	bottle	of sleeping	pills.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	there	anything	wrong	with	the	car?”	I	asked	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	broken,”	she	said.	“I’m	going	to	kill	myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	there’s	nothing	wrong	with	the	car,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	she	said.	“The	car	is	fine.	I	just	had	it	tuned	up,	in	fact.	I’m	driving	it around	as	we	speak.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	what	do	you	want	from	me	then?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	want	you	to	listen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	up,	across	the	room,	and	saw	Adam	standing	outside	his	office,	gazing around	the	floor.	He	was	wearing	his	headset	but	he	wasn’t	looking	at	me.	I disconnected	and	went	outside	for	a	break. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hope	was	standing	on	the	stairs	outside	the	building,	smoking	a	cigarette.	I	told her	about	the	suicide	call. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	always	want	you	to	listen,”	she	said	and	shook	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	trained	for	this,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wouldn’t	worry	about	it,”	she	told	me.	“It’s	best	never	to	believe	anything these	people	say.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	you	don’t	think	she	was	going	to	kill	herself?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>“Well,	what	would	you	be	able	to	do	about	it	if	she	was?”	She	shook	her	head again.	“No,	it’s	really	best	not	to	believe	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	LAST	TIME	Jude	called	was	the	night	I	was	fired.	“I	couldn’t	get	her	to come	back	here,”	he	said,	“so	I’m	just	going	to	call	her	on	my	cell	phone	and we’ll	do	it	that	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can’t	keep	calling	like	this,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	tell	you	what	she	says,”	he	went	on,	“or	I	can	just	put	the	two	phones together	and	you	can	talk	to	her	directly.	Whatever	works	for	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	works	for	me	is	hanging	up	right	now,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you’re	here	to	help	me,”	he	said.	“It	says	so	right	on	my	membership	card.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Goodbye,”	I	told	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	locked	my	baby	in	the	truck,”	he	said	quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	paused	but	didn’t	say	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	truck’s	still	running,”	he	said.	“In	the	garage.	It’s	going	to	fill	up	with carbon	monoxide.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	don’t	you	just	open	the	garage	door,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	stuck,”	he	said.	“Frozen	solid.	You	have	to	help	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	do	this,”	I	told	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you	hang	up	on	me,”	he	said,	“you’ll	be	killing	my	baby.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	even	have	a	baby?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	ours,”	he	said.	“Me	and	my	girlfriend’s.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	say	anything	for	a	moment,	and	he	took	my	silence	for	assent,	started giving	me	the	information	I	needed.	By	the	time	I	was	done	filling	out	the	forms on	the	computer,	I	could	hear	a	distant	ringing.	“I’m	just	calling	her	now,”	he said,	his	voice	distant.	I	realized	he	had	put	the	phones	up	against	each	other	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>was	listening	in	on	both. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	there	was	no	answer.	The	phone	kept	ringing	and	ringing.	There	wasn’t	even voice	mail.	“All	right,”	I	said	after	a	minute	or	so	of	this.	“You	have	to	stop.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	we	call	her	back	later?”	Jude	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	we	can	call	her	back	later,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	tell	her	to	buy	an	answering	machine,”	he	said.	“So	you	can	leave	a message	if	she’s	not	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,”	I	said.	“Sure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Someone	will	be	there	shortly	to	get	your	baby	out	of	the	truck,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,	right,”	he	said	and	hung	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Adam	came	on	the	line	right	away.	“You	can	start	packing	up	your	things	now,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	even	bother	looking	around	for	him.	“What	else	could	I	do?”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	listen	to	the	whole	call?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	why	didn’t	you	say	something	earlier?”	I	asked.	“Why	didn’t	you	just disconnect	the	call?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	wasn’t	my	call,”	he	said.	“It	was	yours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	think	there	really	was	a	baby?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	he	said.	There	was	only	dead	air	for	a	moment,	and	then	he	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	nothing	personal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>OUTSIDE,	HOPE	WAS	standing	on	the	steps	of	the	building,	smoking	a cigarette.	I	told	her	what	had	happened.	She	looked	at	me	for	a	moment,	then	up at	the	sky.	It	was	beginning	to	rain	again.	I	couldn’t	see	the	moon	anywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	got	fired	over	someone	you	don’t	even	know?”	Hope	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	sort	of	knew	him,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	took	one	last	drag	on	the	cigarette	and	then	dropped	it	to	the	ground.	“I	hope he	doesn’t	call	me	next.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	just	needs	someone	to	talk	to,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hope	nodded,	then	said,	“Well,	I’d	better	get	back	inside.	Someone’s	going	to have	to	take	all	your	calls	now.”	But	she	paused	halfway	in	there,	holding	the door	open	as	she	looked	back	at	me.	“I	never	talk	to	them	myself,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I’ve	been	doing	this	a	lot	longer	than	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	say	anything,	just	looked	at	her.	She	closed	the	door	and	disappeared back	into	the	building,	leaving	me	alone	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,”	I	said	and	went	down	the	steps.	“It’s	all	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>PLEASE</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>By	Peter	Darbyshire</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	MET	THE	COMA	WOMAN	at	Kennedy’s	place.	I	went	there	to	talk	to	him about	a	job,	but	he	was	throwing	a	party	when	I	drove	up.	People	were staggering	out	of	his	yard	and	falling	down	in	the	street.	I	drove	around	them	and parked	a	dozen	houses	up,	then	walked	back,	holding	my	jacket	over	my	head	to protect	myself	from	the	rain.	Two	weeks	of	it	had	turned	all	the	lawns	into swamps	and	still	it	came	down,	filling	the	air	like	static.	At	the	end	of	Kennedy’s driveway,	two	women	were	trying	to	lift	a	man	who	was	lying	face	down	in	the street,	his	head	half-submerged	in	the	overflow	from	a	storm	drain.	“He’s	going to	drown,”	one	of	the	women	kept	saying,	but	the	other	was	laughing	so	hard they	couldn’t	even	get	his	face	out	of	the	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kennedy	was	sitting	on	the	swing	set	in	the	front	yard,	smoking	a	joint	with	a woman	who	held	an	umbrella	above	them.	For	some	reason	he	was	wearing	a housecoat	over	his	jeans	and	T-shirt.	“Hey,	glad	you	could	make	it,”	he	said	and offered	me	the	joint.	He	kept	holding	it	out	to	me	even	after	I	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	know	you	were	having	a	party,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	to	celebrate	my	new	job,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	didn’t	invite	me,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wyman	told	me	you	had	a	line	on	a	job.	I	came	here	to	talk	to	you	about	that.	I didn’t	know	anything	about	a	party.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	got	a	job,”	Kennedy	said.	“I	don’t	have	anything	for	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beside	him,	the	woman	reached	out	and	took	the	joint	from	his	hand,	then disappeared	under	the	umbrella. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	rain	was	starting	to	seep	through	my	jacket,	which	I	was	still	holding	over my	head.	Kennedy	kept	on	grinning	at	me,	but	he	had	to	blink	against	the	rain hitting	his	eyes.	Finally,	he	said,	“Well,	the	important	thing	is	that	you’re	here now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>WE	WENT	UP	the	stairs	to	his	apartment	and	into	the	kitchen,	where	half	a dozen	men	and	women	were	playing	cards	at	the	table.	They	all	looked	at	me	for a	moment	and	then	went	back	to	staring	at	their	cards.	I	didn’t	know	any	of them.	Kennedy	took	a	pair	of	Heinekens	from	the	fridge	and	handed	me	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	all	that’s	left,”	he	apologized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Those	are	mine,”	said	one	of	the	card	players,	a	man	with	dreadlocks	and	a beard.	He	hadn’t	looked	away	from	his	cards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	to	Kennedy,	but	he’d	already	wandered	off	into	the	living	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Help	yourself,”	the	other	man	said.	He	threw	out	the	jack	of	spades	and	kept staring	at	his	hand.	“I	just	want	you	to	know	they’re	mine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">THERE	WERE	ANOTHER	dozen	or	so	people	in	the	living	room,	talking	in	the corners	or	dancing	in	the	middle	of	the	room.	All	the	furniture	had	been	pushed to	the	walls.	The	music	was	coming	from	speakers	taped	to	the	ceiling	fan	with duct	tape.	The	television	was	on	in	one	corner	of	the	room,	showing	the aftermath	of	some	bombing	somewhere,	but	the	sound	was	muted.	Kennedy	and I	sat	on	the	couch,	beside	the	coma	woman.	I	thought	she	was	only	sleeping	at first,	but	she	didn’t	wake	up	when	I	pushed	her	legs	aside,	just	moaned	a	little and	wrapped	her	arms	tighter	around	the	cushion	she	was	hugging.	It	looked	like she’d	been	drooling	into	it	heavily	for	some	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	Mia,”	Kennedy	said.	“King	brought	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“King’s	here?”	I	looked	around	the	room	but	I	didn’t	seem	to	know	anyone	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	he	was	the	one	who	stole	my	Tom	Waits	tickets.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	was	here,”	Kennedy	said,	“but	then	he	had	to	go	work	a	party	somewhere.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Took	them	right	out	of	my	wallet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	he	just	left	her	here,”	Kennedy	went	on.	“Without	telling	me.	What	am	I supposed	to	do	with	her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	Mia.	She	was	wearing	cheap	camouflage	pants	and	a	black	hooded sweatshirt,	but	the	Swatch	on	her	wrist	looked	real.	“Is	she	his	girlfriend?”	I asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>“I	don’t	know,”	Kennedy	answered.	“I	thought	so	at	first,	but	then	she	kept	going on	about	her	dead	boyfriend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dead?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Electrocuted.	Got	zapped	by	a	faulty	mike.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	was	a	singer?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	so,”	Kennedy	said.	“Either	that	or	a	roadie.	She	told	me,	but	I	can’t remember	exactly.”	He	shook	his	head.	“She	keeps	his	ashes	on	her	bedside table.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	that’s	love,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	certainly	something,”	Kennedy	said.	He	drained	half	the	Heineken	in	one swallow,	then	smacked	his	lips.	“King’s	always	leaving	his	shit	here.	It’s	got	to stop.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	watched	a	trio	of	women	dance	in	the	center	of	the	room	for	a	while.	Their clothes	were	all	wet,	so	they’d	stripped	down	to	just	pants	and	bras,	but	even their	skin	looked	cold	and	white.	“Who	are	these	people?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	no	idea,”	Kennedy	said.	“They	came	with	some	people	from	the	new job.	But	everyone	I	knew	left	a	long	time	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	watched	the	women	for	a	moment	longer,	and	then	I	said,	“What	kind	of	job is	this	anyway?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	a	broker	kind	of	thing,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	know	about	being	a	broker?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	what	you	know,”	he	said,	“it’s	what	you	act	like	you	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	finished	the	Heineken	and	dropped	the	bottle	to	the	floor,	then	he	got	up	and started	dancing	with	the	women.	They	opened	their	circle	just	enough	that	he could	get	in	but	they	didn’t	speak	to	him.	He	didn’t	seem	to	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	got	up	and	went	into	the	kitchen.	The	card	players	were	all	half-undressed	now, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>a	pile	of	clothes	on	one	side	of	the	table.	I	tried	to	find	my	shoes.	They	weren’t where	I	had	left	them.	“I	think	someone	took	my	shoes,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	exactly	are	you	trying	to	say?”	the	man	with	the	dreadlocks	asked, looking	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	back	to	searching	for	my	shoes	in	the	muddy	pile	without	answering	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	still	looking	for	them	when	Kennedy	dragged	Mia	into	the	kitchen.	She was	still	unconscious.	“Do	me	a	favour,	man,”	he	said,	shoving	her	at	me.	“Take her	with	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	boneless,	arms	and	legs	flopping,	eyes	rolling	sightlessly.	I	pushed	her right	back.	“She’s	not	mine,	I	don’t	want	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	brought	your	car,	though.	You	can	take	her	in	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	the	next	few	seconds	we	bounced	her	back	and	forth	between	us,	the	card players	watching	silently,	until	her	head	slammed	into	my	jaw.	I	caught	her	in my	arms	before	she	hit	the	floor,	but	only	just.	Then	Kennedy	pushed	us	out	the door,	and	we	fell	down	the	stairs.	My	head	hit	the	rail,	and	everything	slid	to	one side	for	a	moment.	When	it	came	back,	I	was	lying	on	the	wet	ground	outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Far	above	my	head,	the	moon	glowed	through	the	clouds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	sat	up,	there	was	wet	newspaper	clinging	to	my	arms	and	legs.	I	tried pulling	it	off	but	it	only	came	away	in	little	strips.	I	pushed	myself	to	my	feet and	started	off	toward	the	street.	The	woman	with	the	umbrella	was	still	pushing herself	back	and	forth	on	the	swing	set,	watching	me	now.	I	remembered	Mia and	went	back	for	her.	She	was	lying	face	down	in	the	muck,	still	unconscious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	head	rolled	like	her	neck	was	broken	when	I	picked	her	up,	but	her	breathing was	regular	at	least.	I	carried	her	to	my	car	and	dropped	her	on	the	hood	while	I looked	for	my	keys.	The	rain	really	came	down	then,	knocking	me	sideways while	I	unlocked	the	doors.	I	jammed	Mia	into	the	passenger	seat	and	covered her	with	an	old	blanket	I	kept	in	the	back.	I	had	no	idea	what	I	was	going	to	do with	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	walked	around	to	the	driver’s	side,	I	noticed	an	old	couple	standing	a few	cars	down,	watching	me.	They	were	wearing	dark	jogging	suits	with reflective	stripes	and	shining	white	running	shoes,	and	their	hair	was	plastered	to their	heads,	like	they’d	been	out	in	the	rain	all	night.	When	they	saw	me	looking at	them,	they	slowly	jogged	away,	glancing	back	over	their	shoulders	every	now</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>and	then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	got	in	the	car	and	started	it.	“Hotel	California”	was	playing	on	the	radio,	and	I reached	for	the	tuning	knob	before	I	remembered	it	had	broken	off	last	week.	I slammed	my	hand	into	the	radio	until	it	stopped,	then	sat	there	for	a	long moment,	watching	the	windshield	fog	up	from	my	breath.	Our	wet	clothes	made the	car	smell	like	some	animal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	clock	in	the	dashboard	said	it	was	one	in	the	morning.	What	were	those people	doing	running	in	the	rain	at	one	in	the	morning? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	DROVE	BLINDLY	around	the	streets	for	maybe	five	minutes,	shivering	and watching	my	skin	turn	white	from	the	street	lamps.	I	didn’t	know	where	to	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	I	should	just	take	you	to	a	hospital,”	I	said	to	Mia.	“What	do	you	think of	that?”	She	didn’t	answer,	didn’t	even	move	under	the	blanket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	out	the	window,	at	the	dark	houses	surrounding	us.	We	were	in	a neighbourhood	I’d	never	seen	before.	Quiet	little	houses	from	the	fifties,	old trees,	children’s	bicycles	left	in	the	front	yards.	No	garbage	in	sight	anywhere.	I had	no	idea	where	I	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	must	be	a	hospital	around	here	somewhere,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	STOPPED	AT	a	7-Eleven	for	directions.	It	took	forever	to	get	from	the	car	to the	doors,	the	rain	beating	down	on	me	the	whole	time	like	a	million	tiny	fists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	as	spotless	as	a	commercial	inside,	everything	in	neat	rows	on	the	shelves, air	freshener	instead	of	air.	The	only	sign	of	life	was	a	thin	trail	of	brownish water	leading	to	the	coffeepot.	Behind	the	counter,	a	man	of	about	forty	or	so was	eating	a	potato	chips	and	flipping	channels	on	a	miniature	television	set.	I saw	the	same	bombing	scene	I’d	seen	at	Kennedy’s	place,	before	he	switched	it to	the	end	of	2001. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	need	to	find	a	hospital,”	I	told	him,	counting	out	pocket	change	for	a	coffee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	that	bad,”	he	said.	“All	you	need	is	a	bandage.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	talking	about?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>He	touched	his	lips	and	pointed	at	me	but	didn’t	say	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	raised	a	hand	to	my	mouth	and	watery	blood	ran	down	my	fingers.	There	was	a small	gash	in	my	lower	lip.	“Jesus,”	I	said.	“When	did	that	happen?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wouldn’t	know,”	he	said,	turning	back	to	the	television.	“But	the	bandages	are in	the	third	aisle,	middle	top	shelf.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	have	time	for	that,”	I	said.	“I’ve	got	a	woman	in	a	coma	outside.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	gave	me	the	directions,	but	only	after	I	paid	for	the	coffee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	HOSPITAL’S	emergency	room	smelled	like	soap.	The	place	was	nearly empty	when	I	carried	Mia	inside,	just	one	couple	and	their	kids	sitting	in	a	circle in	the	corner.	The	parents	glanced	up	at	us,	then	went	back	to	praying	quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	kids	stared	at	the	floor	the	whole	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	dropped	Mia	into	a	chair	at	the	nurses’	station	and	waited.	Behind	the	glass wall	in	front	of	me,	three	nurses	were	talking	about	their	various	ex-husbands.	It sounded	like	the	same	guy	to	me.	I	was	still	waiting	for	them	to	figure	this	out when	one	of	them	came	over	and	asked,	“What’s	the	problem?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	problem,”	I	said.	“I	just	want	to	drop	her	off.”	We	both	looked	at	Mia.	A string	of	drool	slowly	slipped	from	her	chin	to	her	chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Has	she	been	drinking?”	the	nurse	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	really	sure,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	nurse	looked	back	at	me.	“You’re	not	really	sure?	Now	what	does	that mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	I	said.	“I	found	her.	I	thought	maybe	I	could	leave	her	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,	we’ll	just	have	to	fill	out	the	paperwork	for	that,”	the	nurse	said.	She smiled	at	the	other	nurses	when	she	said	it,	and	I	couldn’t	tell	if	she	was	joking or	not.	She	had	me	go	through	Mia’s	pockets,	but	all	I	could	find	was	a	piece	of paper	with	an	address	written	on	it.	Five	Crossings.	I	couldn’t	find	her	ID</p>
<p class="calibre1">anywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>The	nurse	entered	my	name	and	address	on	a	form,	then	took	us	down	the	hall	to another	room.	What	seemed	like	hours	later,	an	old,	red-faced	doctor	finally came	in.	He	glanced	at	Mia	and	then	washed	his	hands	in	the	sink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	the	father	or	the	boyfriend?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Neither,”	I	said.	“I’ve	only	just	met	her.”	I	couldn’t	take	my	eyes	off	the garbage	can	in	the	corner.	It	was	full	of	bloody	bandages.	I	wondered	what	had gone	on	in	there	before	we’d	arrived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	been	drinking?”	the	doctor	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	what	the	nurse	figured.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shone	a	light	in	Mia’s	eyes	and	felt	her	pulse	for	a	moment.	“You	have	pieces of	newspaper	stuck	all	over	you,”	he	told	me	through	a	yawn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I	know	that,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	also	have	no	shoes	on,”	he	pointed	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	that,	too,	thanks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	she’ll	probably	be	all	right,”	he	said,	dropping	Mia’s	hand.	“She	just needs	to	sleep	it	off.	Now	let’s	have	a	look	at	that	lip	and	we	can	get	you	two	on your	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	want	to	leave	her	here,	though,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can’t	do	that,”	he	said.	“There’s	really	nothing	wrong	with	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	don’t	want	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	isn’t	the	pound.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">IT	WAS	STILL	RAINING	when	I	took	Mia	back	to	the	car.	I	dropped	her	in	the passenger	seat	and	sat	there	for	a	moment,	wondering	what	to	do	next.	I	looked at	the	piece	of	paper	with	the	address	again,	then	searched	for	the	map	in	the glove	compartment.	I	had	to	sort	through	a	mess	of	candy	wrappers,	condoms, Wake-Ups,	a	bag	of	chips	I	couldn’t	remember	buying,	and	the	registration</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>papers	-	so	faded	and	water-stained	I	couldn’t	even	read	them	any	more	-	before I	found	it.	Crossings	Street	was	at	the	farthest	edge	of	the	city,	an	area	I’d	never been	to	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“King	had	better	be	there,”	I	told	Mia,	then	started	up	the	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">WHEN	I	FINALLY	found	Crossings	Street,	it	was	only	a	half-built	subdivision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	of	the	houses	were	finished,	but	most	were	still	empty	frames.	You	could have	seen	the	stars	through	them,	if	you	could	actually	see	the	stars	anywhere around	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five	Crossings	was	one	of	the	biggest	houses	I’d	ever	seen.	Two	long	stories	of swirling	stone	and	glass	walls	rising	up	out	of	a	muddy	lot.	Practically	a mansion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	parked	the	car	on	the	empty	street,	under	a	street	lamp	that	kept	turning	on	and off,	and	carried	Mia	to	the	door.	I	knocked	but	no	one	answered.	I	thought	about leaving	her	on	the	doorstep.	Then	I	tried	the	door.	It	was	open.	No	alarms	went off.	I	stepped	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	moment,	I	thought	I’d	walked	into	a	church.	It	was	dark	inside,	but	there was	enough	light	from	the	street	lamp	that	I	could	see	the	place	was	empty,	just one	cavernous	room	after	another.	But	the	walls.	The	walls	were	covered	with giant	murals	of	angels	falling	from	white	clouds,	toward	buildings	in	ruins beneath	them.	It	was	only	when	I	walked	into	the	next	room	and	saw	the	murals there	-	Charles	Manson,	Margaret	Thatcher,	Burt	Reynolds,	all	dancing	together around	a	bonfire	-	that	I	realized	it	was	all	spray	paint.	Graffiti. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	dragged	Mia	through	two	living	rooms	and	into	the	kitchen.	There	were	no appliances	in	here,	just	empty	spaces	in	the	walls.	It	didn’t	look	like	anybody had	ever	lived	here.	There	was	no	sound	but	our	breathing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	out	the	back	window.	There	was	a	huge	yard	but	no	grass.	It	was	all mud.	And	there	was	a	large	hole	that	looked	as	if	it	might	have	been	made	for	a pool	that	had	never	been	put	in,	or	had	been	put	in	and	taken	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	found	some	stairs	leading	to	the	second	floor	and	carried	Mia	up	them.	All	the rooms	up	here	were	empty	too.	I	took	her	into	a	bedroom	bigger	than	my	entire apartment	and	locked	the	door	behind	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>I	lowered	Mia	to	the	floor	and	then	lay	down	beside	her.	I	thought	about	my stolen	Tom	Waits	tickets	again.	When	Mia	started	to	moan	and	shiver,	I	took	off her	wet	sweatshirt.	The	alternating	light	from	the	street	lamp	made	everything look	like	snapshots.	I	could	see	her	bra	had	little	kissing	Mickey	and	Minnie Mouse	figures	all	over	it.	I	thought	about	taking	it	off	as	well,	but	then	she sighed	and	rolled	into	me,	slipped	her	hand	around	my	waist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	her	a	moment	longer,	then	took	off	my	jacket,	the	inside	of	which was	still	more	or	less	dry,	and	wrapped	it	around	her.	I	could	feel	her	breath against	my	chest.	I	laid	my	head	back	on	the	polished	hardwood	floor	and	closed my	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	DREAMED	ABOUT	my	wife,	Rachel,	there.	Only	it	was	more	a	memory	than a	dream.	We	were	in	another	rainstorm,	years	earlier.	We	were	swimming	in	this luxury	condo’s	outdoor	pool.	We’d	just	been	driving	by	when	we	saw	it.	No	one was	in	it.	We	parked	the	car	and	climbed	over	the	fence,	took	off	our	clothes.	It was	sometime	past	midnight.	Sheets	of	lightning	fell	from	the	sky.	Rachel	stood on	the	diving	board,	naked,	her	arms	held	up	to	the	sky	like	she	was	calling	it down.	And	then	an	old	woman	came	out	onto	a	balcony	above	us	and	shouted, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get	out	of	here!	You	don’t	belong	here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	we	do,”	Rachel	shouted	back.	“This	is	all	ours!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	called	the	police,”	the	old	woman	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	where	we	live,”	Rachel	said.	And	then	she	dove	in	and	came	to	me under	the	water,	pulling	me	down	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	WOKE	TO	the	sounds	of	glass	breaking	in	the	distance	and	an	engine	starting up.	For	a	moment	I	thought	my	car	was	being	stolen.	Then	I	heard	something louder,	something	collapsing.	I	got	up	and	went	to	the	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside,	the	rain	had	finally	stopped,	and	the	early	morning	air	had	become	a thin	mist.	My	car	was	still	there,	its	windows	unbroken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	neighbouring	houses	were	nothing	but	dim,	looming	shapes.	I	couldn’t	see where	the	sound	was	coming	from,	but	it	kept	up.	It	sounded	like	tanks	were somewhere	out	there	in	the	mist,	roaming	the	streets,	smashing	into	the	houses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	carried	Mia	down	to	the	car,	my	jacket	still	wrapped	around	her,	and	got	behind</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>the	wheel.	My	stomach	started	to	growl	as	the	first	rays	of	the	sun	began	to	burn holes	through	the	grey.	I	started	the	car	and	drove	slowly	down	the	street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	drove	for	about	a	minute	or	so	before	I	came	across	the	source	of	the	noise.	It was	a	bulldozer,	tearing	down	one	of	the	houses.	I	stopped	the	car	to	watch.	It drove	into	the	front	wall	of	the	house,	smashing	its	blade	through	a	large	picture window.	Then	it	lowered	the	blade	and	tore	apart	the	wall	underneath	the window.	The	bulldozer	reversed	across	the	muddy	yard,	then	drove	into	another part	of	the	wall	a	few	feet	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	flatbed	truck	and	a	couple	of	pickups	were	parked	on	the	street.	Men	with white	hard	hats	were	drinking	coffee	from	thermoses	and	watching	the	bulldozer work.	I	drove	on	when	they	all	turned	to	look	at	me	and	Mia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	kept	on	driving,	past	more	half-built	houses	-	or	half-destroyed,	I	wasn’t	sure now	-	and	then	a	long	field	bordered	by	a	rusted	chain-link	fence	and	filled	with bags	of	garbage.	On	the	other	side	of	the	field	were	more	houses,	but	there	were cars	in	the	driveways,	and	people	walked	up	and	down	the	streets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	drove	until	I	found	a	McDonald’s.	There	was	a	car	stalled	in	the	drive-through line,	so	I	parked	in	the	lot	and	went	inside.	I	ordered	an	Egg	McMuffin	and	a coffee.	When	I	came	back	out,	Mia	was	awake	and	sitting	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	are	we?”	she	asked,	looking	around	as	I	got	into	the	car	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	I	said.	I	cradled	the	coffee	between	my	legs	and	started	on	the Egg	McMuffin.	The	first	bite	burned	my	throat	all	the	way	down,	but	I	didn’t mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	a	friend	of	King’s?”	Mia	asked.	When	I	didn’t	say	anything	she	began to	scrape	the	dried	mud	from	her	face	with	her	fingernails,	then	paused	to	look down	at	herself.	“Where’s	my	shirt?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	a	long	story,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	do	something	to	me	while	I	was	passed	out?”	She	sounded	more curious	than	upset.	“You	could	have	at	least	waited	for	me	to	wake	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wouldn’t	touch	you,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>“Yeah,	right.”	She	slid	her	arms	into	the	sleeves	of	my	jacket,	did	up	the	zipper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	when	you’re	in	love	with	that	dead	guy,”	I	went	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	know	anything	about	it,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	lifted	the	Egg	McMuffin	from	my	hand,	took	a	bite.	“I	saw	this	show	on television	the	other	day,”	she	said.	“This	woman	was	in	a	car	accident	when	she was	pregnant.	The	dashboard	was	pushed	into	her	stomach.	The	doctors	couldn’t hear	a	heartbeat.	They	told	her	the	baby	was	dead	and	said	they’d	have	to	abort it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tried	to	take	the	Egg	McMuffin	back,	but	she	held	it	away	from	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	she	wouldn’t	let	them	take	it.	She	carried	it	through	full-term,	even	though she	thought	it	was	dead.	But	when	it	came	out,	it	was	alive.	She’d	brought	it back	to	life,	just	like	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please,”	I	said	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	that’s	love.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">WHAT	HAPPENED	TO	OUR	BABY? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a>By	Peter	Darbyshire</p>
<p class="calibre1">THIS	IS	THE	STORY	of	how	I	met	Rachel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	working	at	one	of	the	hospitals	downtown	at	the	time.	They	needed	extras for	training	and	disaster	drills	and	the	like.	My	job	was	to	be	a	victim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	my	first	day,	a	nurse	made	me	get	into	a	gown	and	lie	on	a	bed	in	the	hall	-</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	the	rooms	were	full,	she	said	-	and	then	the	doctor	in	charge	of	the	exercise came	to	see	me.	He	was	drinking	coffee	from	a	Starbucks	mug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	the	interns	come,	I	want	you	to	hold	yourself	here,”	he	said,	pointing	to	a spot	on	my	stomach.	“Make	a	lot	of	noise	whenever	anyone	touches	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	wrong	with	me?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	it	could	be	any	number	of	things,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	about	cancer?”	I	said.	“Everybody	gets	cancer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you	like.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	exactly	are	the	symptoms?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	doesn’t	really	matter,”	he	said,	watching	a	passing	nurse	and	sipping	from	his mug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	how	are	they	supposed	to	know	what	I’m	dying	from	if	I	don’t	even	know the	symptoms?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	isn’t	that	kind	of	exercise,”	he	said.	“You	can’t	actually	tell	what’s	wrong with	someone	just	by	feeling	their	stomach.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	why	are	we	doing	this?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	not	testing	them	to	see	if	they	know	what’s	wrong	with	you,”	he	said, looking	at	his	watch.	“We’re	testing	them	to	find	out	if	they	know	the procedure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	WORKED	AT	THE	HOSPITAL	once	or	twice	a	week.	I	was	always	suffering</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>from	some	sort	of	deadly	condition	-	brain	tumors,	strokes,	heart	attacks,	that kind	of	thing.	I	researched	them	all	in	the	library	downtown	so	I	could	perform the	symptoms	properly.	It	was	like	I	actually	was	dying.	I	could	have	been. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	usually	worked	the	same	shifts	as	Rachel.	She	specialized	in	acting	out	mental disorders.	She	told	me	one	day	that	I	was	one	of	the	best	patients	she’d	ever seen.	We	were	lying	in	beds	across	from	each	other	in	a	room	on	the	children’s ward,	which	was	the	only	floor	they	had	space	on	that	day.	“If	they	gave	away Oscars	for	this	business,”	she	said,	“you’d	have	my	vote.”	She	was	chewing	on something	that	made	her	mouth	froth,	and	foam	was	running	down	her	chin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’d	told	me	earlier	that	it	had	something	to	do	with	the	condition	she	was supposed	to	have,	but	I	thought	it	made	her	look	rabid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	doctor	brought	the	interns	in,	Rachel	started	to	shake	and	shudder	in her	bed.	She	spat	more	foam	out	of	her	mouth	and	down	onto	her	breasts,	rolled her	eyes	back	so	I	couldn’t	see	anything	but	white. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	doctor	stepped	aside	and	waved	in	one	of	the	interns,	a	young	man	with glasses	and	a	goatee.	He	bent	down	beside	Rachel	and	slipped	his	finger	into	her mouth.	“Her	airway	seems	to	be	clear,”	he	said	to	the	doctor,	but	that	was	all	he managed	because	then	he	was	swearing	as	Rachel	bit	his	finger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	why	it’s	best	to	use	pens	to	check	airways,”	the	doctor	said	as	the	intern clutched	his	hand	to	his	chest.	“Not	the	plastic	ones,	though.	They	can	bite	them in	half,	and	then	you	get	ink	everywhere.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	intern	took	a	step	toward	the	bed	but	then	stopped	as	Rachel	threw back	her	head	and	let	out	a	long	scream.	It	was	so	loud	I	actually	had	to	cover my	ears	with	my	hands.	The	interns	all	looked	at	each	other,	but	none	of	them stepped	any	closer.	Then	Rachel	curled	up	into	the	fetal	position	and	began	to shake.	She	did	that	for	a	few	seconds,	then	unrolled	her	eyes	and	winked	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	could	I	not	fall	in	love	with	her? </p>
<p class="calibre1">SOMETIMES	I	DID	my	research	at	the	hospital.	I	went	around	the	wards	and watched	patients	in	their	rooms	or	in	the	hallways,	wherever	I	could	find someone	who	had	a	condition	I	wanted	to	learn	about.	I	was	in	there	at	all	hours of	the	day,	but	the	nurses	didn’t	seem	to	mind.	It	was	like	I	was	a	real	patient. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	of	them	even	commented	on	my	acting. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>“You’re	not	dragging	your	legs	enough,”	one	of	them	told	me	when	I	was practicing	my	MS	walk	with	some	crutches	I’d	borrowed	from	a	supply	closet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Try	taking	off	your	clothes,”	another	one	said	when	I	was	sitting	in	the	waiting room,	working	on	my	Alzheimer’s	look.	“They	like	to	take	off	their	clothes when	there	are	nurses	around.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	some	of	the	patients	gave	me	advice.	A	man	who’d	lost	his	legs	in	some sort	of	industrial	press	accident	taught	me	how	to	use	a	wheelchair	like	I’d	been in	it	for	years.	We	spent	the	entire	night	racing	up	and	down	one	of	the	halls, until	I	crushed	the	air	hose	of	a	woman	on	oxygen	who’d	come	out	of	her	room to	complain	about	the	noise.	The	nurses	wouldn’t	let	me	back	onto	that	floor	for a	week,	and	when	I	came	back,	the	man	in	the	wheelchair	was	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once,	the	nurses	left	a	dead	man	on	a	bed	in	the	intensive	care	hallway	because they	were	too	busy	to	take	him	down	to	the	morgue.	Someone	was	having	a heart	attack	or	something	like	that	in	the	room	at	the	end	of	the	hall,	so	they	were all	in	there.	I	lay	down	on	an	empty	bed	across	from	the	dead	man	and	studied him	for	a	while,	then	tried	to	make	myself	look	like	him.	He’d	been	left	with	his eyes	open,	so	I	stared	at	the	ceiling	for	as	long	as	I	could	without	blinking,	tried not	to	move	at	all.	I	only	breathed	when	I	absolutely	had	to.	I	could	actually	feel my	heartbeat	slow	down.	I	wondered	if	this	was	what	meditation	was	like. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	nurses	came	out	of	the	room	at	the	end	of	the	hall	and	rolled	the	dead man	and	his	bed	into	the	elevator.	I	stayed	where	I	was,	not	moving.	A	few minutes	later,	another	nurse	came	out	of	the	room	and	started	pushing	my	bed toward	the	elevator.	She	screamed	and	jumped	away	from	the	bed	when	I	sat	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	I	have	you	fooled?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	you	were	that	dead	guy,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">SOMETIMES,	WHEN	RACHEL	and	I	were	waiting	for	our	shift	to	start,	we’d get	coffees	from	the	cafeteria	and	wander	around	the	hospital.	We	liked	to	make up	stories	about	what	was	wrong	with	the	people	in	the	rooms	we	passed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Flesh-eating	disease,”	I	said	of	a	man	whose	entire	body	was	covered	in bandages.	“The	nurses	are	afraid	to	touch	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>“Cancer,”	Rachel	said	when	we	went	past	a	room	with	a	woman	on	a	lung machine.	“But	she	never	smoked	a	cigarette	in	her	life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Attempted	suicide,”	I	said	of	a	young	woman	who	sat	in	a	wheelchair	by	a window,	drooling.	“She	took	all	the	pills	in	her	apartment	when	her	boyfriend left.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Self-inflicted	gunshot,”	Rachel	said	of	the	same	woman.	“There	was	no boyfriend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	liked	the	intensive	care	ward	the	best.	This	is	where	they	kept	all	the critically	injured	people,	and	we	were	only	allowed	in	there	during	visiting hours.	Most	of	the	people	in	here	were	young,	and	many	of	them	were	dying from	wounds	they’d	sustained	in	accidents	and	that	sort	of	thing.	They	had	a whole	other	wing	for	people	who	were	dying	of	old	age	or	disease. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Imagine,”	Rachel	said	as	we	walked	through	here	one	day,	“the	lives	of	all these	people	are	still	going	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	into	a	room	at	a	man	who	appeared	to	be	in	a	coma.	He’d	been	asleep for	as	long	as	I’d	worked	at	the	hospital,	and	there	were	tubes	going	into	both	his arms.	“I	don’t	know	about	that,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	mean	in	here,”	Rachel	said.	“I	mean	outside.	All	these	people	have	lives waiting	for	them	out	there.	They	have	family,	jobs,	houses,	cars,	money, everything	you	can	think	of,	just	waiting	for	these	people	to	get	better	and	come back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	some	of	them	aren’t	going	to	get	better,”	I	pointed	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Imagine	if	you	could	take	their	place,”	she	said.	“Just	step	into	their	lives	and take	over	from	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	there	are	laws	against	that	sort	of	thing,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	could	be	anybody	you	wanted	to	be.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">ON	ONE	OF	OUR	WALKS,	Rachel	and	I	found	ourselves	in	the	part	of	the hospital	where	they	keep	the	babies.	There	was	a	room	full	of	them	on	the	other side	of	a	glass	wall,	each	one	in	its	little	incubator.	Nurses	wandered	around	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>room,	making	sure	they	were	all	right.	The	babies	closest	to	the	glass	waved their	arms	and	feet	at	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	like	we’re	their	parents	or	something,”	Rachel	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	we’re	not,”	I	pointed	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	it	wasn’t	for	the	nurses,	we	could	just	probably	take	them	and	go,	and	they’d never	know	the	difference.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	are	easier	ways	of	getting	children,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	watched	as	a	nurse	lifted	one	of	the	babies	from	its	incubator	and	took	it	into a	back	room.	There	was	a	woman	in	a	bathrobe	sitting	in	a	wheelchair	back there,	and	before	the	door	closed,	we	saw	her	hold	out	her	arms	for	the	baby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	think	we’d	be	like	if	we	were	the	parents	of	some	of	these	kids?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	mean?”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	pointed	at	the	nearest	baby,	a	dark-haired	thing	with	a	face	that	looked	as	if it	had	been	pushed	down	with	sandpaper.	“Who	would	we	be	if	we	were	this kid’s	parents?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	the	baby	for	a	moment.	“I’d	be	a	lawyer,”	I	finally	said.	“Corporate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’d	be	…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An	accountant,”	she	said.	“We’d	have	a	big	condo	downtown.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	two	cars,”	I	said.	“New	ones.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	a	cottage	on	a	lake	somewhere,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	we’d	vacation	in	the	Caribbean	every	winter,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	pointed	out	a	baby	that	wouldn’t	stop	crying.	“What	about	that	one?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With	lungs	like	that,”	I	said,	“I’d	have	to	be	some	sort	of	musician.	Maybe	even</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>a	rock	star.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	be	your	manager,”	she	said.	“We	started	out	working	together,	and	then	we fell	in	love.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On	a	tour	of	Europe,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	live	in	an	estate	outside	the	city,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	gold	albums	and	everything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	have	maids	and	people	who	do	our	lawns.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	more	money	than	we	can	ever	spend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	pointed	to	a	baby	at	the	back	of	the	room.	This	one	was	tiny,	half	the	size of	the	others,	and	it	was	in	a	different	kind	of	incubator,	one	that	was	all enclosed	in	glass	and	had	tubes	running	into	it	from	machines.	The	nurses checked	on	this	baby	every	few	minutes,	and	they	stopped	smiling	whenever they	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	that	one?”	Rachel	asked.	“Who	would	we	be	if	we	were	that	baby’s parents?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	be	worried,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	WAS	ACTING	OUT	so	many	deadly	diseases	and	conditions	that	I	couldn’t even	tell	when	I	was	acting	and	when	I	was	really	sick.	Once,	I	woke	with	what	I thought	was	a	real	pain	in	my	stomach.	I’d	been	researching	stomach	cancer	that week,	and	I	knew	all	about	the	low	survival	rate,	so	I	mentioned	it	to	the	doctor in	charge	of	the	training	exercises	when	I	went	in	that	afternoon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	she	said,	“I	was	planning	to	test	them	on	head	injuries	today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	think	this	is	a	real	pain,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	sure	it	isn’t	in	your	head?”	she	asked	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	she	brought	the	interns	in,	the	first	one	shone	a	light	in	my	eyes.	“Are	you feeling	any	pain	or	nausea?”	he	asked.	The	question	was	directed	at	me,	but	he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>was	looking	at	the	doctor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	a	pain	in	my	stomach,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	mean	your	head,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	I	said,	“it’s	in	my	stomach.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	at	the	doctor.	“I	thought	we	were	doing	head	injuries	today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I’m	not	acting,”	I	said.	“I’m	really	in	pain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	study	for	abdominal	pains,”	he	went	on.	“This	isn’t	fair.”	One	of	the other	interns	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	doctor	checked	her	watch.	“Let’s	move	on,”	she	suggested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	think	there’s	something	really	wrong	with	me,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	NEXT	TIME	we	went	back	to	the	room	with	all	the	babies,	the	sick	baby was	still	in	its	incubator	with	all	the	tubes	hooked	up	to	machines.	It	didn’t	look any	bigger,	and	it	didn’t	cry	or	wave	its	arms	and	legs	like	the	other	babies.	It just	lay	there,	looking	up	at	the	fluorescent	lights	overhead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	think	it’s	going	to	live?”	Rachel	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	are	its	parents?”	Rachel	asked,	looking	around.	“What	it	needs	are parents.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	they’re	sick	too,”	I	said.	“Maybe	they’re	in	their	own	special	incubators somewhere.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	looked	at	me,	then	back	at	the	baby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’ll	grow	if	it	thinks	it	has	parents,”	she	said.	“It	just	needs	to	feel	loved.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	what	can	you	do,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	be	its	parents,”	she	said.	She	tapped	on	the	glass.	“Hello,	baby,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>“What	are	you	doing?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wave	to	baby,”	she	told	me.	She	kept	on	tapping	the	glass,	and	the	baby	looked in	our	direction,	as	did	one	of	the	nurses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	not	our	baby,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	doesn’t	know	that,”	Rachel	said.	“It’s	still	young	enough	that	maybe	it’ll imprint	on	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	a	chicken,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wave	to	baby,”	she	said,	“or	it’ll	think	you	don’t	care.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	the	baby.	It	stared	back	at	me,	unmoving	except	for	its	shallow breaths.	I	lifted	a	hand	and	waved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	FEW	MONTHS	after	I	started	working	as	a	victim,	a	pharmaceutical	company hired	Rachel	and	me	for	some	drug	trials.	It	took	place	in	an	old	wing	of	the hospital	that	wasn’t	used	any	more.	The	hospital	had	sealed	off	the	wing	because it	had	been	scheduled	for	demolition	and	rebuilding,	but	then	the	funds	for	the project	had	been	cut	off,	and	the	wing	had	been	left	to	collect	dust,	until	they moved	us	in	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	maybe	a	dozen	of	us	in	total,	all	in	one	big	room	so	the	doctors	could keep	an	eye	on	us.	We	lay	in	beds	along	the	walls	and	watched	a	television they’d	put	in	the	middle	of	the	room.	All	it	played	was	commercials.	Some	of the	others	were	normal	people	like	me	and	Rachel,	but	some	were	actually	sick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guy	in	the	bed	beside	me	told	me	he	was	dying	of	cancer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shouldn’t	you	be	in	another	ward	then?”	I	asked	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	can’t	do	anything	about	it,”	he	said.	“It’s	in	my	head.	They’d	have	to	cut out	most	of	my	brain	to	get	at	it.	Then	where	would	I	be?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	that	a	rhetorical	question?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	hoping	maybe	these	new	drugs	might	do	something,”	he	said,	but	then	he sighed	and	shook	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a>The	trial	ran	for	the	weekend,	and	they	gave	us	pills	every	four	hours.	They	even woke	us	up	if	we	were	sleeping	to	make	sure	we	took	them.	The	pills	all	looked the	same,	tiny	and	blue,	but	the	doctor	in	charge	said	that	some	of	them	were placebos. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	don’t	give	me	any	of	those,”	the	man	beside	me	said.	“That’s	the	last thing	I	need.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	take	his	placebos	if	he	doesn’t	want	them,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	not	the	way	it	works,”	the	doctor	said.	“It’s	all	random.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	I	know	that,”	the	man	beside	me	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	water	had	been	turned	off	in	this	part	of	the	hospital,	so	we	had	to	go	back	to one	of	the	other	wings	if	we	wanted	to	use	the	washroom.	One	of	the	women	in our	group	needed	help	walking	there	because	the	drugs	she	took	made	her	fall down,	and	another	guy	lost	control	of	his	bowels	in	his	bed,	but	I	figured	they were	giving	me	placebos	because	there	was	nothing	wrong	with	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	when	I	went	to	the	washroom,	I	couldn’t	find	my	way	back.	I	wandered	the halls	of	the	closed-down	wing	for	what	seemed	like	hours	before	I	finally	gave up.	I	lay	down	on	the	floor	of	one	of	the	empty	rooms	and	tried	to	go	to	sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	soon	as	I	closed	my	eyes,	though,	all	the	commercials	that	I’d	watched	on that	television	in	the	ward	room	started	playing	in	my	head.	Only	now	Rachel and	I	were	in	them.	We	drove	down	a	coastal	highway	in	a	gleaming	new	car,	we met	each	other’s	eyes	across	a	crowded	bar	and	I	slid	a	drink	down	the	counter to	her,	we	played	one-on-one	basketball	against	each	other	in	a	dark	alleyway.	I still	don’t	know	if	it	was	all	caused	by	the	drugs	or	just	a	dream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	security	guards	found	me	around	dawn.	He	shone	a	flashlight	in	my eyes	and	kept	it	there	even	after	I’d	stood	up.	“We’ve	been	looking	all	over	for you,”	he	said.	“We	even	checked	the	morgue	downstairs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	would	I	be	doing	in	the	morgue?”	I	asked	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	doing	here?”	he	asked,	looking	around	the	empty	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	took	me	back	to	the	room	where	I	was	supposed	to	be,	Rachel	was	just</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a>waking	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	were	you?”	she	asked	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	went	to	the	washroom,”	I	told	her,	climbing	back	into	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	had	this	dream,”	she	said,	shaking	her	head.	“We	were	living	together.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	want	your	drugs,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">RACHEL	AND	I	STARTED	checking	on	our	baby	whenever	we	were	in	the hospital.	We’d	stand	on	the	other	side	of	the	glass	and	wave	and	smile	and	make faces.	Once,	Rachel	even	bought	a	silver	helium	balloon	from	the	hospital’s	gift shop.	It	said	Get	Well	Soon	on	one	side,	and	the	nurses	tied	it	to	one	of	the incubator’s	hoses.	The	baby	waved	its	arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,”	Rachel	said.	“It’s	like	baby’s	trying	to	reach	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	getting	better,”	I	said.	I	put	my	arm	around	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	take	her	eyes	off	the	baby.	“It	really	is,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	baby	grew	stronger	with	each	passing	day.	Soon	it	was	waving	its	arms	and legs	together,	and	once	I	thought	it	even	smiled	at	us,	although	Rachel	thought	it was	just	gas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	it’s	going	to	live,”	I	told	her	one	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	what	kind	of	life	is	it	going	to	have?”	she	asked.	“That’s	the	question.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	going	to	be	an	athlete,”	I	said.	“It’s	going	to	overcome	all	the	odds	and	go on	to	become	one	of	those	success	stories	you	see	on	television.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	be	happy	as	long	as	it’s	not	in	a	wheelchair	or	anything	like	that	for	the	rest of	its	life,”	she	said.	“I	couldn’t	stand	it	if	it	was	crippled.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Even	then,	it’d	still	be	a	hero,”	I	said.	“Like	that	guy	who	rode	his	wheelchair all	around	the	world.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Imagine	that,”	Rachel	said,	tapping	her	fingers	on	the	glass.	“Our	baby,	a	hero.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>BUT	ONE	DAY	we	showed	up	and	our	baby	was	gone.	The	special	incubator was	empty,	and	now	the	nurses	didn’t	even	look	at	it.	The	helium	balloon	was still	attached	to	the	hose,	but	it	hung	half-deflated	in	the	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	no,”	Rachel	said,	putting	her	hands	over	her	mouth.	“What’s	happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,”	I	said,	pounding	on	the	glass	to	get	the	nurses’	attention.	“What	have	you done?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	the	other	babies	started	to	cry	at	the	noise,	and	one	of	the	nurses	waved	at	me to	stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	oh	oh,”	Rachel	said,	staring	at	the	empty	incubator. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	okay,”	I	said.	“Don’t	worry,	it’s	all	right.”	I	didn’t	know	what	else	to	do,	so I	pounded	on	the	glass	some	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	nurses	came	through	the	door	that	led	into	the	room.	“Who	do	you think	you	are,”	she	said,	“upsetting	the	babies	like	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	happened	to	it?”	Rachel	asked.	She	put	her	arms	around	me,	and	I	held her.	“Is	it	all	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	happened	to	what?”	the	nurse	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	happened	to	our	baby?”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	LAST	TIME	I	worked	as	a	victim	was	when	the	hospital	staged	a	disaster simulation.	It	took	place	in	the	parking	lot	of	a	mall,	on	a	Sunday	morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	twenty	of	us,	all	made	up	with	different	injuries	by	professional makeup	crews.	We	sat	on	the	asphalt	while	they	painted	wounds	on	us.	I	asked for	a	bullet	in	the	chest,	but	the	woman	who	worked	on	me	said	it	wasn’t	that kind	of	disaster.	“It’s	an	explosion	of	some	sort,”	she	said.	“With	toxic	gas	and all	that.”	She	did	something	to	my	head	that	made	it	look	all	burned	and	black, then	ripped	the	top	of	my	shirt	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Am	I	getting	reimbursed	for	that?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	think	you	can	vomit?”	she	asked,	rubbing	fake	blood	into	my	chest.	Her hands	were	warm	and	strong,	like	a	masseuse’s.	“We	don’t	have	any	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>simulated	vomit	left,	and	they	wanted	everyone	throwing	up	from	the	gas.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	kind	of	gas	is	this	anyway?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	she	said.	“All	they	said	was	gas.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	I	can	vomit,”	I	said.	“Maybe	I	should	just	take	off	my	shirt	and you	can	put	blood	all	over	me	instead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	we’re	about	done	here,”	she	said.	She	turned	to	Rachel	and	worked	on her	for	a	while,	giving	her	a	slashed	throat	and	covering	one	of	her	eyes	with melted	skin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	do	I	look?”	Rachel	asked	me	when	the	makeup	woman	was	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perfect,”	I	told	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	hospital	had	hired	a	professional	film	director,	a	man	by	the	name	of	Eden, to	stage	the	event.	He	listed	off	all	the	films	he’d	worked	on,	but	I’d	never	heard of	any	of	them.	He	arranged	us	around	a	burned-out	tanker	truck	they’d	parked in	one	corner	of	the	lot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	was	in	a	real	accident,”	he	told	us.	“Two	or	three	people	got	killed.	So	try to	play	off	that,	uh,	realistic	feeling.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	put	up	her	hand.	“What	do	you	mean,	‘two	or	three’?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	fire	department	guys	told	me	two	bystanders	died	when	it	blew,”	Eden	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“but	they	never	found	the	driver,	so	they’re	not	sure	what	happened	to	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	the	cab	of	the	truck.	It	was	all	melted,	the	metal	fused	together	so tightly	you	couldn’t	see	inside	it.	I	wondered	if	the	driver	was	still	in	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eden	spread	us	out	around	the	truck	and	told	us	to	lie	down	until	the	ambulances arrived.	He	walked	among	us,	adjusting	people’s	limbs	and	telling	us	to	show more	pain,	that	sort	of	thing.	A	couple	of	times	he	stopped	and	looked	at	the scene	through	a	little	lens	hanging	from	his	neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,”	he	said,	when	he	was	done,	“I’m	going	to	call	the	ambulances	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Try	to	stay	in	character	when	they	get	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p63"></a>Beside	me,	Rachel	lay	back	and	looked	up	at	the	sky,	practised	her	moaning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eden	walked	over	to	the	snacks	table	and	grabbed	a	gasoline	container	from underneath	it.	He	took	it	over	to	the	burned-out	truck	and	poured	gas	all	over	the hood	and	the	cab.	Then	he	tossed	the	can	aside	and	took	a	lighter	from	his pocket,	lit	the	truck	on	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	stopped	her	moaning	and	looked	up.	“There’s	no	gas	left	in	the	truck,	is there?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	there	going	to	be	fire	trucks	too?”	I	called	out,	but	Eden	shook	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	this	is	just	for,	uh,	effect,”	he	said.	“I	thought	it	would	make	things	look more	real.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	thought?”	Rachel	said,	watching	the	smoke	from	the	fire	rise	up	into	the sky.	“Does	the	hospital	know	about	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	no	one’s	going	to	put	out	the	fire?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eden	didn’t	answer,	though,	because	he	was	talking	into	his	cell	phone	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everybody’s	in	places	here,”	he	said.	“We’re	ready	for	the	take.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	around	the	parking	lot.	People	were	pulling	into	parking	spots	around our	taped-in	area	and	getting	out	of	their	cars,	wandering	into	the	mall.	Some	of them	looked	our	way,	but	no	one	actually	stopped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eden	frowned	as	he	put	away	his	phone.	“Attention,	people,”	he	shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	been	a	delay.	It	seems	there’s	been	a	real	disaster	in	a	chemical	plant	on the	other	side	of	the	city,	and	our	ambulances	got	sent	there	by	mistake.	They thought	it	was	the	exercise.”	People	around	Rachel	and	me	groaned,	but	Eden held	up	his	hands.	“I	want	you	all	to	stay	in	position,”	he	said.	“They’re	going	to come	for	us	as	soon	as	they	realize	the	mistake.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	lay	there	for	a	while	longer,	until	the	sun	was	almost	directly	overhead.	I began	to	sweat,	but	I	stayed	in	place.	The	smoke	from	the	fire	drifted	down	over us,	and	everyone	began	to	cough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	if	they	don’t	realize	it’s	a	mistake?”	Rachel	wondered	after	maybe	half	an hour	of	this.	“What	if	they	think	that	other	disaster	is	really	the	exercise	all</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>along?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	they’d	better	figure	it	out	soon,”	I	said,	“because	my	makeup	is	starting	to melt.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	then	we	heard	the	sirens.	“Thank	God,”	Eden	said	and	turned	in	the direction	of	the	mall	entrance.	But	it	wasn’t	ambulances	that	drove	in,	it	was	fire trucks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	no	no,”	Eden	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	three	fire	trucks	in	total,	two	regular	ones	and	one	of	those	smaller kind	that	the	paramedics	drive.	They	wound	their	way	through	the	parking	lot, honking	their	horns	at	the	people	going	in	and	out	of	the	mall	as	they	tried	to find	their	way	to	us.	They	had	to	circle	around	us	once	before	they	discovered	a path	through	the	parked	cars.	They	drove	into	the	exercise	area,	the	lead	truck going	through	the	tape	as	it	did	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,”	Eden	shouted,	running	at	the	truck.	“You’re	breaking	the	scene	integrity.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	trucks	stopped,	and	firemen	in	full	gear	climbed	out.	One	of	them	pushed Eden	out	of	the	way	and	started	shouting	at	a	group	of	others	who	were	unrolling a	hose.	He	pointed	at	the	truck,	which	was	still	burning,	and	they	dragged	the hose	toward	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	this	was	an	exercise	for	the	ambulance	staff,”	I	said	to	Rachel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shrugged.	“As	long	as	we	get	paid,”	she	said.	She	closed	her	eyes	and started	to	moan	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	firemen	turned	on	the	hose	and	began	spraying	the	truck.	“No!”	Eden	cried and	put	his	hands	in	the	air.	And	now	other	firemen	were	kneeling	beside	the closest	victims,	looking	at	their	fake	wounds	and	reaching	into	their	first	aid	kits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	these	guys	know	this	is	an	exercise,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	opened	her	eyes	and	watched	the	firemen	for	a	moment.	Another	group had	unrolled	a	second	hose	and	they	began	spraying	water	on	the	victims	closest to	the	truck.	The	makeup	melted	away	under	the	water,	and	Eden	screamed	and threw	himself	in	the	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a>“Someone	else	must	have	called	them,”	Rachel	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	should	we	be	playing	our	parts	or	not?”	I	wondered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’d	better	ask	Eden,”	Rachel	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	really	think	we	should	break	the	scene?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	she	was	already	on	her	feet	and	walking	over	to	Eden,	so	I	got	up	and followed	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eden	was	on	his	knees	when	we	reached	him,	staring	at	the	firemen	as	they started	loading	people	onto	stretchers.	He	held	his	hands	clasped	to	his	chest, like	he	was	praying.	There	were	more	sirens	in	the	distance	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	should	we	do?”	I	asked	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	we	still	getting	paid	for	this?”	Rachel	asked	at	the	same	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hospital,”	Eden	said,	only	it	came	out	more	like	a	gasp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	it?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take	me,”	he	said,	making	that	same	gasping	noise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	only	then	I	realized	that	he	wasn’t	praying,	he	was	holding	his	chest.	“I think	he’s	having	a	heart	attack,”	I	said	to	Rachel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eden	nodded	and	caught	my	hand	with	one	of	his.	“Hospital,”	he	said	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	so,”	I	said,	trying	to	push	his	hand	off	mine.	“They’ll	take	care	of you	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Help,”	Rachel	called,	waving	her	arms	at	the	firemen.	“We	need	some	help here.”	But	none	of	them	looked	at	us,	because	they	were	all	busy	with	the	other victims. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please,”	Eden	said,	squeezing	my	hand	just	a	little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	victims,	not	…”	I	didn’t	know	how	to	finish. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>“I’ll	pay	you,”	Eden	gasped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">WE	DRAGGED	EDEN	through	the	parking	lot,	to	my	car.	“How	much	exactly are	we	getting	paid	for	this?”	I	wanted	to	know	as	we	drove	around,	looking	for an	exit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hundred	bucks,”	Eden	gasped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Each?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shook	his	head.	“Only	have	hundred,”	he	managed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	hundred	bucks	to	save	your	life?”	I	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	we’re	still	getting	paid	for	the	exercise,	too,	right?”	Rachel	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eden	didn’t	answer,	just	turned	his	head	and	looked	out	the	window	at	the	last bit	of	smoke	rising	from	the	truck.	“Would	have	been	perfect,”	he	sighed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	found	the	way	out	and	went	down	the	street	in	the	direction	of	the	hospital. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More	fire	trucks	drove	past	us,	and	I	could	hear	sirens	in	all	directions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	really	not	a	professionally	run	operation,”	Rachel	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	we	should	start	a	union	or	something,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	we	should	look	for	another	job,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	would	we	do?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Something	with	benefits,”	she	said.	“In	case	we	ever	really	get	sick.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	we	turned	into	the	hospital	entrance,	I	started	to	head	for	the	parking	lot, but	Eden	stopped	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,”	he	moaned	from	the	back	seat.	“Emergency!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	can’t	park	in	Emergency,”	I	said.	“It’s	just	for	ambulances	and	stuff.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Emergency,”	Eden	said	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a>“I	think	you	can	park	long	enough	to	bring	someone	inside,”	Rachel	said.	“You just	can’t	leave	it	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,”	I	said,	“but	I	better	not	get	towed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">None	of	that	mattered,	though,	because	as	I	drove	into	the	Emergency	area,	I collided	head-on	with	an	ambulance	coming	the	other	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	second	before	we	hit,	the	ambulance	driver	and	I	stared	at	each	other through	our	windshields.	He	opened	his	mouth	to	say	something.	Rachel screamed.	Then	the	steering	wheel	came	up	and	hit	me	in	the	face,	and	I	couldn’t open	my	eyes	for	a	while. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	finally	managed	to	force	them	open	once	more,	I	saw	Eden	staggering through	the	Emergency	doors.	In	the	ambulance,	the	driver	was	slumped	back	in his	seat,	unconscious	or	dead,	I	couldn’t	tell.	The	other	paramedic	was	standing in	the	rear	of	the	ambulance,	holding	his	head	with	one	hand	and	the	inside	wall of	the	ambulance	with	the	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’d	better	get	out	of	here,”	I	said,	but	when	I	looked	over	at	Rachel,	I	saw	that she	was	injured	too.	She	was	slumped	back	in	her	seat,	and	the	windshield	was cracked	from	where	her	head	had	hit	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Help!”	I	called	out.	I	tried	to	undo	my	seat	belt,	but	it	was	stuck.	“Help!”	I called	again,	this	time	to	the	paramedic	who	was	conscious.	He	was	out	of	the ambulance	and	stumbling	around	to	the	front	of	the	vehicle	now.	He	looked	my way,	then	opened	the	driver’s	side	door	of	the	ambulance	and	dragged	out	the other	paramedic.	I	pounded	on	the	horn,	but	he	didn’t	look	back	as	he	carried	the other	man	through	the	Emergency	doors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	Rachel	again.	I	couldn’t	even	see	if	she	was	still	breathing	or	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	worry,”	I	said.	“I	won’t	let	you	go.”	I	leaned	across	as	best	I	could	with the	seat	belt	holding	me	back,	and	I	pinched	her	nostrils	shut,	blew	air	into	her mouth.	“I’ll	keep	you	alive	until	someone	can	save	you,”	I	told	her.	I	kept	it	up until	the	nurses	came	out	and	took	her	away	from	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	the	first	time	we	kissed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>JESUS	CURED	MY	HERPES</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a>By	Peter	Darbyshire</p>
<p class="calibre1">AFTER	I	GOT	KICKED	OUT	of	The	Code,	I	started	driving	out	to	the	airport	at night	to	watch	the	planes	take	off.	I’d	find	an	empty	side	street	and	sit	on	the hood	of	my	car	for	hours.	Sometimes	the	planes	passed	right	over	me,	so	low	I could	almost	touch	them.	You	could	watch	them	for	several	minutes	before	they disappeared	into	the	clouds	overhead.	There	were	always	clouds	over	the	airport. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	other	people	out	there	who	watched	the	planes,	too.	Most	just	parked on	the	street	like	me,	but	there	was	one	group	of	men	that	met	in	front	of	a twenty-four	hour	garage.	They	were	always	there	whenever	I	drove	past,	no matter	what	time	of	night.	Five	or	six	of	them	sitting	in	a	circle	of	lawn	chairs	at the	edge	of	the	garage’s	parking	lot,	staring	up	at	the	sky	and	drinking	beer	from cans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once,	I	parked	behind	their	row	of	trucks	and	wandered	over	to	the	edge	of	their circle.	“Mind	if	I	join	you?”	I	asked.	They	all	looked	at	me	for	a	moment	and then	made	noises	like	this	was	okay	with	them.	One	of	them	reached	into	a cooler	at	his	feet	and	pulled	out	a	beer,	tossed	it	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	didn’t	say	anything	at	all	as	they	waited	for	the	next	plane	to	pass,	just	kept staring	up	at	the	empty	sky.	I	looked	over	at	the	garage.	The	doors	were	open, and	inside	I	could	see	two	men	in	grease-stained	overalls	bent	over	the	engine	of a	car.	One	man	would	touch	a	part	of	the	engine	and	shake	his	head,	then	the other	man	would	do	the	same	with	another	part	of	the	engine.	In	the	doorway	of the	garage,	a	woman	was	talking	on	a	cell	phone.	“You	don’t	understand,”	I heard	her	say,	“I’m	stuck	here.	I	can’t	go	anywhere.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	plane	passed	a	couple	of	hundred	feet	over	us	just	then.	Over	the	noise	of	its engines,	the	man	beside	me	shouted,	“DC-10.	Series	10.	General	Electric	CF6-6</p>
<p class="calibre1">engines.	40,000	pounds	takeoff	thrust.	Two	hundred	and	fifty	passengers,	three cockpit	crew.	First	flight	made	in	1970.”	The	other	men	nodded	and	lifted	their beer	cans	to	their	lips.	Nobody	said	anything	else	until	the	next	plane	came. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	the	man	next	to	the	first	one	who	had	spoken	said,	“737.	800	model. </p>
<p class="calibre1">General	Electric	CFM56-7B	engines.	27,300	pounds	thrust.	189	passengers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First	launched	in	1965.”	They	all	nodded	again	and	drank	some	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	mechanics	got	behind	the	wheel	of	the	car	and	tried	to	start	it	up.	The engine	turned	over	and	over	but	didn’t	catch.	The	other	mechanic	looked	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p70"></a>woman	and	shook	his	head.	“I	don’t	even	know	where	I	am,”	she	shouted	into her	phone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	men	went	around	the	circle	until	it	was	my	turn.	When	the	next	plane	passed overhead,	they	all	looked	at	me.	I	looked	up	at	the	plane.	“United	Airlines,”	I said.	“Probably	going	to	New	York.”	They	kept	staring	at	me	until	the	next	plane came,	but	even	then	they	didn’t	say	anything.	They	didn’t	speak	again	the	whole time	I	was	there,	and	they	didn’t	offer	me	another	beer	after	I	finished	the	first one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	garage,	one	of	the	mechanics	closed	the	hood	of	the	car.	The	other	one went	over	to	a	coffeemaker	in	the	corner	and	poured	himself	a	cup.	The	woman put	her	cell	phone	in	her	purse	and	looked	up	and	down	the	street.	Then	she	went over	to	the	car	and	sat	behind	the	wheel,	started	turning	over	the	engine	herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	made	a	slow	grinding	noise,	like	the	engine	was	tearing	itself	apart	underneath the	hood.	I	could	hear	it	all	the	way	back	to	my	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">AND	ONCE	I	SAW	a	plane	struck	by	lightning.	It	was	only	a	hundred	feet	or	so off	the	ground	when	the	lightning	hit	it,	so	quickly	that	all	I	really	saw	was	the afterimage.	There	were	two	bolts	-	one	came	down	from	the	clouds,	while	the other	rose	up	from	the	wet	ground	-	and	they	met	somewhere	in	the	fuselage.	I couldn’t	see	anything	but	white	for	a	moment	because	of	the	lightning,	but	I	felt the	vibration	from	the	thunder	where	I	sat	on	the	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	waited	for	the	plane	to	fall	from	the	sky	but	it	didn’t.	Instead,	it	kept	on	rising into	the	sky,	until	it	disappeared	in	the	clouds.	It	was	as	if	the	lightning	had	never happened,	or	I	had	imagined	it.	For	a	moment	I	thought	that	perhaps	everyone	on board	was	dead,	that	the	lightning	had	electrocuted	them	all	in	their	seats,	and that	the	plane	was	flying	on	its	own	now.	I	had	a	vision	of	it	continuing	to	rise	up into	the	sky,	perhaps	all	the	way	out	of	the	atmosphere	and	into	orbit,	everyone inside	melted	into	their	seats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	went	home	later	that	night,	I	turned	on	the	television	and	watched	for any	stories	about	the	plane.	There	was	nothing,	though,	just	a	few	brief	sound bites	about	the	salvage	operation	of	a	different	plane	that	had	gone	down	in	the ocean	a	few	days	earlier.	Nothing	at	all	about	any	planes	being	struck	by lightning.	It	was	as	if	I	were	the	only	person	in	the	world	who	even	knew	it	had happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>ANOTHER	TIME	I	STOPPED	at	a	twenty-four-hour	coffee	shop	by	the	airport. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	surrounded	by	overgrown	grass	fields,	and	empty	coffee	cups	and	plastic bags	filled	the	ditches	at	the	side	of	the	road.	There	was	a	tractor	trailer	with	a cargo	of	live	cows	in	the	parking	lot.	A	couple	of	them	turned	their	heads	to	look at	me	through	the	slats	of	the	trailer	as	I	went	inside,	but	the	others	just	kept	on staring	at	each	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	driver	of	the	truck	was	inside,	looking	at	a	road	map	spread	out	across	the counter.	He	was	following	lines	on	it	with	a	yellowed	finger	and	shaking	his head.	“I	just	have	no	idea	how	I	got	here,”	he	kept	saying	to	the	woman	behind the	counter,	who	wasn’t	paying	him	any	attention	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	down	with	a	coffee	by	the	window,	where	I	could	still	see	the	lights	of	the planes	taking	off	from	one	of	the	runways.	Every	now	and	then	one	of	the	cows outside	made	a	long,	low	noise,	like	the	sound	of	a	car	horn	slowed	down.	The truck	driver	pushed	his	hat	around	on	his	head	each	time	he	heard	the	noise,	but he	didn’t	look	up	from	the	map. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	while,	two	women	and	a	man	all	wearing	the	same	kind	of	T-shirt	came in.	The	T-shirt	was	black	with	the	word	BLESSING	in	red	across	their	breasts.	I watched	their	reflections	in	the	glass	as	they	went	up	to	the	counter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Last	night	I	started	shaking	all	over	in	bed,”	one	of	the	women	was	saying.	“It went	on	for	ten	minutes.	I	know	because	I	was	looking	right	at	the	clock	the whole	time.	But	I	couldn’t	stop	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	had	that	electrical	feeling	myself,”	the	other	woman	said.	“You	know,	all	the hair	on	my	body	was	standing	on	end.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	like	someone	else	had	taken	me	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	actually	gave	my	cat	a	shock	when	he	came	over	to	see	what	was	going	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	ran	into	the	other	room	and	wouldn’t	come	near	me	all	day	today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	never	felt	a	thing,”	the	man	said.	“Haven’t	for	a	long	time.”	He	was	going bald,	and	the	whole	time	they	were	in	there	he	kept	pushing	the	hair	he	had	over the	bald	spot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stanley	tried	to	climb	on	top	of	me	during	the	middle	of	it,”	the	first	woman said,	shaking	her	head.	“He	pretended	he	was	in	a	rapture	and	couldn’t	control</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a>himself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	man,”	the	other	woman	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	first	woman	bought	an	eclair	and	bit	off	one	end,	began	sucking	the	cream out	from	inside.	“But	don’t	you	worry,”	she	said	through	a	mouthful	of	cream,	“I put	a	stop	to	that	soon	enough.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	like	to	feel	it	again,”	the	man	said,	frowning	into	his	coffee.	“Just	one	more time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both	women	laid	their	hands	on	him.	“Maybe	tonight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	maybe	tonight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe,”	the	man	said,	but	he	kept	on	staring	into	his	coffee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jesus	Christ,”	the	truck	driver	said,	slamming	his	hand	down	on	the	map.	“This doesn’t	make	any	sense	at	all.”	He	stared	out	at	his	truck	and	sighed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	people	in	the	Tshirts	looked	away	from	him	and	didn’t	say	anything	else until	they	were	on	their	way	out.	One	of	the	women	stopped	at	my	table	and	bent over	me.	“I	saw	you	watching	us,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wasn’t,”	I	told	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would	you	like	to	talk	about	God?”	she	asked	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	so,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	would	you	like	to	see	him	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	WENT	OUT	with	them	to	their	car.	The	cows	were	pushing	against	each	other in	the	back	of	the	truck	now,	rocking	the	trailer	from	side	to	side.	The	woman who’d	spoken	to	me	said,	“They	feel	it	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Feel	what?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll	see,”	she	said,	and	for	some	reason	the	others	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	left	my	car	in	the	lot	and	got	in	the	back	of	theirs,	along	with	the	man,	who</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a>introduced	himself	as	Hank.	The	woman	who’d	talked	to	me	first	said	her	name was	Helen.	The	other	woman,	the	driver,	never	introduced	herself	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	went	about	a	mile	or	so	down	the	street,	to	a	building	that	looked	as	if	it	had once	been	a	warehouse,	or	maybe	a	factory.	The	parking	lot	was	already	full	of cars,	and	the	front	doors	of	the	place	were	wide	open,	lighting	up	a	crowd	of people	standing	outside.	“Looks	like	the	non-believers	are	out	again	tonight,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hank	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Atheists?”	I	asked,	looking	at	the	crowd.	They	held	signs	in	their	hands	and were	shouting	at	everyone	that	went	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	no,	they’re	Christians,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	you	were	the	Christians.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	are,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	understand,”	I	told	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	just	jealous,”	Helen	said	from	the	front	seat.	“The	Lord	doesn’t	touch them	like	he	touches	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	so	sure	about	this,”	I	told	them,	but	I	got	out	of	the	car	and	followed them	to	the	building	anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	people	outside	all	wore	the	same	kind	of	T-shirt,	too,	but	this	one	was	white with	a	red	cross	on	the	front.	Other	than	that,	these	people	didn’t	look	any different	from	the	people	I	was	with.	Their	signs	said	things	like	JESUS	DIED</p>
<p class="calibre1">FOR	YOUR	SINS,	NOT	YOUR	SEX	and	GOD	DOESN’T	BARK.	“Satan!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">they	shouted	at	us	as	we	approached.	“Satan!	Satan!	Satan!”	And	one	of	them,	a woman	who	looked	a	little	like	my	dead	grandmother,	sprayed	me	with	a Windex	bottle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey	hey	hey,”	I	said,	but	Hank	took	me	by	the	arm	and	guided	me	through	the doors.	“Don’t	worry	about	it,”	he	said.	“It’s	only	holy	water.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	that	again	and	I’ll	press	charges,”	I	shouted	back	at	her	over	my	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	inside	of	the	building	was	a	large	room	filled	with	folding	metal	chairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a>They	were	spread	out	in	loose	rows,	with	plenty	of	room	between	the	rows	and with	a	large	aisle	running	down	the	middle	of	the	room.	The	aisle	ended	in	a large	open	area	on	the	other	side	of	the	room,	over	which	a	giant	wooden crucifix	and	carved	Christ	hung	from	the	wall.	Christ’s	body	was	all	contorted, like	he	was	having	a	seizure,	and	he	looked	like	he	was	laughing	or	screaming,	I couldn’t	tell	which. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	sat	at	the	back	of	the	room,	because	most	of	the	seats	were	already	taken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	other	people	wearing	the	BLESSING	T-shirt	here,	but	most	were dressed	in	normal	clothes	or	what	I	imagined	passed	for	normal	clothes	with	this crowd.	Everyone	was	smiling	and	talking	to	the	people	around	them.	It	looked like	the	sort	of	religious	rally	you	see	on	television,	but	I’d	always	thought	those things	were	staged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	turnout,”	said	the	woman	whose	name	I	still	didn’t	know.	“God	must have	called	a	lot	of	people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	going	to	be	a	special	night,”	Helen	said,	nodding	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hank	didn’t	say	anything	at	all,	just	stared	at	the	Christ	hanging	over	the	stage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	some	time,	a	couple	of	the	men	in	the	audience	got	up	and	closed	the doors.	I	heard	one	last	“Satan!”	from	outside.	Everyone	seemed	to	stop	talking and	look	at	the	Christ	at	the	same	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	could	hear	my	own	breathing,	my	heartbeat	in	my	ears.	Then	the	women around	me	began	murmuring	softly,	too	low	for	me	to	catch	the	words.	Soon everyone	in	the	crowd	seemed	to	be	talking	softly	to	themselves,	even	Hank	-</p>
<p class="calibre1">everyone	but	me,	that	is.	I	kept	waiting	for	something	else	to	happen.	I	was getting	hungry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	a	woman	stood	up	in	the	middle	of	the	room,	knocking	her	chair	to	the ground.	“Jesus	cured	my	herpes!”	she	shrieked.	She	pushed	her	way	to	the	end of	her	row	and	ran	down	the	aisle.	Once	she	was	underneath	the	Christ	on	the wall,	she	fell	to	the	ground	and	started	rolling	around	on	the	carpet,	still shrieking	the	same	words	over	and	over.	“Jesus	cured	my	herpes!	Jesus	cured	my herpes!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	around	the	room,	but	nobody	else	seemed	to	be	paying	much	attention to	this.	A	pair	of	older	ladies	near	me	were	even	smiling	and	nodding	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a>woman	rolling	around	on	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	man	in	a	suit	near	the	front	stood	up	and	shouted,	“Jesus	turned	my	cavities into	gold	teeth!”	He	fell	to	his	knees	and	started	kissing	the	carpet.	There	were murmurs	of	“Hallelujah”	and	“Amen”	from	the	crowd.	A	few	rows	in	front	of	us, another	man,	this	one	in	a	post-office	uniform,	stood	up	and	started	weeping loudly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	I’m	going	to	leave,”	I	said,	but	Hank	put	his	hand	on	my	leg.	“Not	yet,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	said.	“Not	until	you	feel	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Feel	what?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	wait,”	he	said.	He	didn’t	take	his	hand	off	my	leg. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	murmuring	in	the	crowd	grew	louder,	and	now	I	could	hear	some	of	what the	people	around	me	were	saying.	“Please,	God,	take	me,”	a	woman	sitting directly	in	front	of	me	whispered.	“Just	one	more	year,”	a	man	a	few	chairs down	said.	“Make	it	stop	eating	me,”	someone	behind	me	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	as	if	on	cue,	a	dozen	or	so	people	scattered	around	the	room	all	stood	up	at once	and	began	shrieking	gibberish	at	the	people	around	them.	They	acted	as	if they	were	saying	things	that	made	sense,	but	I	couldn’t	understand	a	word	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	entire	front	row	of	people	fell	to	the	floor	and	started	convulsing	there,	as	if they	were	all	having	simultaneous	fits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	watched	it	spread	through	the	crowd,	like	some	sort	of	virus.	People	ran hollering	to	the	front	of	the	room,	where	they	fell	to	the	ground	and	barked	like dogs.	Others	writhed	up	and	down	the	aisle	like	snakes.	A	man	tore	open	his shirt,	and	the	woman	sitting	beside	him	began	kissing	his	breast,	pecking	at	it like	a	bird.	The	air	filled	with	screams	and	cries	and	hysterical	laughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beside	me,	Helen	began	laughing	and	fell	to	the	floor.	She	caught	hold	of	one	of my	pant	legs	with	a	hand	and	tried	to	pull	me	down	after	her,	but	I	hung	on	to	the chair.	A	few	seconds	later,	Hank	slowly	slid	off	his	chair,	then	started	shaking and	convulsing	on	the	ground.	His	hand	was	still	on	my	other	leg,	stroking	up and	down	it.	I	kept	pushing	it	away,	but	he	kept	putting	it	back.	All	around	us, people	were	falling	to	the	floor,	touching	each	other	all	over,	screaming hysterically. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>Then	the	woman	whose	name	I	didn’t	know	laid	her	hands	on	either	side	of	my head	and	kissed	me	on	the	lips.	I	could	taste	the	cream	from	the	eclair,	could smell	her	perfume.	I	went	to	push	her	away,	but	it	was	too	late.	It	was	as	if someone	else	had	taken	control	of	my	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	fell	to	the	floor	and	felt	myself	shaking,	flopping	around	like	I’d	been	Tazered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	hands	were	everywhere	on	Helen	and	Hank’s	bodies,	their	hands	everywhere on	mine.	The	woman	whose	name	I	didn’t	know	crowed	like	a	rooster.	I	tried	to scream	but	could	only	manage	a	long	sigh.	My	whole	body	was	burning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later,	when	I	was	away	from	that	place	and	back	in	my	car,	I	passed	off	what happened	there	as	some	sort	of	crowd	hysteria.	I’d	read	about	that	sort	of	thing before,	how	a	few	people	in	a	crowd	could	cause	everyone	else	to	act	the	same way.	It	wasn’t	God,	I	decided,	but	some	sort	of	psychological	thing.	Or	maybe some	sort	of	chemical	pumped	in	through	the	air	vents.	Whichever.	The important	thing	was	it	didn’t	last. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	some	point	during	the	night	-	it	could	have	been	hours	or	minutes	after	I	fell to	the	floor,	I	couldn’t	tell	-	the	protestors	from	outside	opened	the	doors	and	ran in.	They	started	spraying	the	people	closest	to	the	doors	with	their	Windex bottles,	all	the	while	shouting,	“Get	thee	hence,	Satan!”	and	“In	the	name	of	God I	evict	thee!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">None	of	the	holy	water	actually	reached	me,	but	once	the	doors	to	outside	were open,	I	suddenly	had	control	of	my	body	again.	I	got	up	and	ran	for	the	doors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hank	reached	after	me,	howling,	but	I	kicked	him	away.	A	protestor	waved	a sign	at	me	-	something	about	one	of	the	passages	in	Luke	-	and	I	pushed	her	to the	ground,	stumbled	outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	raining	out	now,	but	I	didn’t	care.	I	kept	running,	through	the	parking	lot and	down	the	road,	back	to	the	coffee	shop.	Once	a	car	came	from	the	direction of	the	church	or	whatever	it	was,	and	I	hid	in	the	grass	at	the	side	of	the	road, burying	myself	in	the	plastic	bags	there.	For	a	while,	I	could	still	hear	screams and	laughter	from	behind	me,	even	through	the	rain.	My	body	was	still	burning from	whatever	it	was	that	had	happened	in	the	church,	but	it	faded	a	little	more with	the	sound	of	each	plane	that	passed	overhead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	never	felt	that	way	again	in	my	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	SAW	THE	FIRST	of	the	cows	about	fifty	feet	or	so	from	the	coffee	shop.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a>was	lying	in	the	middle	of	the	road,	bellowing	loudly.	All	four	of	its	legs	looked to	be	broken.	It	swung	its	head	wildly	at	me,	so	I	walked	along	the	shoulder	until I	was	past	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	two	more	in	the	coffee	shop’s	parking	lot.	One	lay	just	at	the entrance	to	the	drive-through.	It	was	dead,	its	neck	broken,	head	twisted	around to	lie	along	the	top	of	its	own	spine.	The	other	one	was	lying	on	the	ground behind	my	car.	There	didn’t	seem	to	be	anything	wrong	with	it	-	it	turned	its head	to	look	at	me	as	I	walked	up	-	but	it	was	blocking	my	way	out	of	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	truck	that	had	been	carrying	the	cows	was	parked	about	a	hundred	feet	away from	the	coffee	shop.	The	back	door	of	the	trailer	hung	brokenly	from	its	hinges, and	I	could	see	it	was	empty	inside	now.	The	cows	were	everywhere,	more	lying on	the	asphalt,	others	wandering	up	and	down	the	road	or	grazing	on	the	grass	at the	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	truck	driver	was	standing	by	the	rear	of	his	truck	and	talking	to	the	woman from	the	coffee	shop	as	I	walked	up.	“It’s	the	damnedest	thing	I	ever	saw,”	he said,	running	his	hand	over	the	broken	door.	“They	just	started	going	crazy	in there.	For	a	moment,	I	thought	they	were	going	to	tip	the	trailer.	But	then	they busted	out	the	back.”	He	pushed	his	cap	up	and	down	on	his	head.	“Bolt	in	the door	must	have	rusted	right	through.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	you	can’t	just	leave	them	here,”	the	woman	said.	“It’s	bad	for	business.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	right,”	I	said.	“One	of	those	cows	is	blocking	my	car.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	all	watched	one	of	the	cows	piss	on	the	road	for	a	moment,	and	then	the woman	said,	“You’ll	have	to	round	them	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	how	am	I	supposed	to	do	that?”	the	truck	driver	said.	“Without	getting trampled	to	death,	that	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How’d	you	get	them	in	the	first	time?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	not	my	job,”	he	said,	shaking	his	head.	“They’ve	got	special	places	for that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	could	herd	them	with	my	car,”	I	said,	“if	we	can	move	the	cow	behind	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a>They	both	looked	at	me	for	a	moment,	and	then	the	truck	driver	said,	“No, there’s	a	very	definite	policy	for	moments	like	this.”	He	went	up	to	the	cab	of	the truck	and	came	back	with	a	rifle.	“How’d	you	like	to	make	fifty	bucks?”	he asked	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	all	depends,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	waited	until	a	plane	was	passing	overhead,	then	shot	the	cow	that	had	pissed on	the	road.	It	fell	to	the	ground	without	making	a	noise	and	shook	there	for	a moment.	Several	of	the	grazing	cows	looked	over	their	shoulders	at	us	and	then moved	a	few	feet	deeper	into	the	grass.	For	some	reason,	steam	was	rising	from their	hides	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	going	to	need	help	dragging	them	back	into	the	truck,”	he	said,	chambering another	round.	“I	can’t	move	them	on	my	own.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Make	it	a	hundred	then,”	he	said.	“But	that’s	all	I’ve	got	on	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	going	back	inside,”	the	woman	said.	“I’ve	got	to	make	fresh	coffee.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	could	sure	use	another	coffee	now,”	the	truck	driver	said.	Another	plane passed	over	us,	and	he	shot	one	of	the	cows	lying	on	the	road.	This	one	had	a single	broken	leg.	It	tried	to	get	up	as	the	driver	approached	but	it	couldn’t	stand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Its	eyes	rolled	wildly	as	he	put	the	gun	against	its	head	and	pulled	the	trigger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	killed	three	more	cows	by	the	time	the	woman	came	out	with	coffee	for each	of	us.	“It’s	fresh,”	she	said,	“and	on	the	house.”	She	looked	around	at	the dead	cows	and	shook	her	head.	“Given	the	circumstances	and	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	stood	there	for	a	moment,	blowing	steam	from	our	coffee.	Then	the	truck driver	sighed.	“I’m	never	going	to	make	that	deadline	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shot	one	of	the	grazing	cows	square	in	the	head,	but	this	one	didn’t	go	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	saw	bone	chips	fly	off	into	the	gravel	at	the	side	of	the	road,	and	blood	sprayed as	far	as	my	shoes,	but	the	cow	just	shook	its	head	and	stared	at	the	truck	driver. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“God’s	looking	out	for	that	one,”	the	woman	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a>The	trucker	lifted	his	cap	off	and	then	settled	it	back	on	his	head.	I	saw	that	he was	bald	underneath.	He	fired	another	shot	into	the	cow’s	head,	and	more	blood and	bone	chips	flew.	The	cow	staggered	this	time	but	still	didn’t	go	down.	It started	running	down	the	road.	And	now	the	surviving	cows	started	after	it, bellowing	at	us	as	they	passed.	Even	the	one	that	had	been	lying	behind	my	car got	up	and	went	with	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	truck	driver	aimed	at	the	wounded	cow	once	more,	but	this	time	his	gun jammed.	He	worked	at	it	for	a	moment,	then	swore	and	threw	the	gun	to	the ground.	I	was	half	expecting	it	to	go	off,	but	it	never	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	was	almost	miraculous,”	the	woman	said.	When	the	truck	driver	looked	at her,	she	added,	“For	the	cow,	I	mean.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	wasn’t	anything	but	a	jammed	round,”	the	driver	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	watched	the	cows	go	down	the	road,	leaving	a	trail	of	blood	behind	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">About	two	or	three	hundred	feet	down,	they	suddenly	swerved	into	the	field, heading	towards	the	airport’s	lights.	Even	from	this	distance,	we	could	see	the cloud	of	steam	rising	from	their	hides. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	if	it	wasn’t	a	miracle,”	the	woman	said,	“then	I	think	it’s	as	close	as	we’re going	to	get.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>WHERE	WE	LIVE</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>By	Peter	Darbyshire</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	WENT	BACK	to	The	Code	a	couple	of	months	after	I’d	been	kicked	out.	I	was still	out	of	work	and	almost	out	of	money.	It	was	the	middle	of	the	afternoon, and	the	place	was	almost	empty.	I	was	thinking	about	robbing	it,	but	I	couldn’t see	a	waitress	or	bartender	anywhere,	although	someone	was	laughing	in	the kitchen.	I	sat	at	the	bar	and	dropped	some	of	my	last	quarters	into	the	electronic poker	game	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	only	other	person	in	The	Code	was	Wyman.	He	was	sitting	at	a	table	in	the back	corner,	talking	into	his	cell	phone,	but	when	he	saw	me	he	hung	up	and came	over.	He	sat	on	the	stool	beside	me,	his	eyes	fixed	on	the	television	screen above	the	bar.	There	was	a	football	game	on,	but	I	couldn’t	tell	who	was	playing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	have	anything	to	sell	you	today,”	Wyman	said.	“I’m	all	cleaned	out,	and my	supplier’s	gone	out	of	town.”	This	was	Wyman’s	business:	he	sat	at	that	table in	the	corner	nine-to-five	and	sold	drugs	to	the	regulars	and	anyone	else	who could	afford	it.	He	used	to	work	in	the	movie	business	as	an	extra	or	something, but	I	think	he	was	making	more	money	this	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	all	right,”	I	said,	“because	I’m	broke	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	thought	that	over	for	a	moment.	“Well,	you	want	to	make	some	money then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	just	came	in	here	to	have	a	drink	and	play	this	game,”	I	told	him.	But	I’d already	lost	and	I	didn’t	have	any	more	quarters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wyman	nodded	and	lit	a	cigarette	with	a	silver	Zippo	lighter.	He	kept	flicking	it open	and	shut	while	he	watched	the	football	game.	“I	need	some	help	with	a break	and	enter,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	around	the	bar	again,	but	I	still	couldn’t	see	the	waitress.	I	thought about	going	behind	the	counter	to	pour	myself	a	beer.	“I	didn’t	know	you	were	a burglar,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shook	his	head.	“It’s	not	like	that.	The	stuff	I’m	taking	is	mine.	But	I	have	to break	into	the	place	to	get	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	understand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a>“It’s	my	supplier’s	place.”	He	leaned	closer,	glancing	around	the	empty	bar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	out	of	town,	but	all	my	stuff	is	there.	I’m	going	to	clean	her	out	while she’s	gone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	in	this	for	me?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	give	you	two	hundred	dollars,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	want	me	to	help	rip	off	a	dealer	for	two	hundred	dollars?”	I	laughed.	“I don’t	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	have	to	actually	do	anything,”	he	said.	“I	just	want	somebody	to	go with	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	understand,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Call	it	moral	support.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	him	closer.	He	hadn’t	shaved	in	days,	and	his	upper	lip	was	covered in	little	beads	of	sweat.	“Who	exactly	is	your	dealer,	Wyman?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	ex-wife,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stared	at	him.	“You	were	married?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">WE	WALKED	DOWN	the	street	to	the	coffee	shop	where	Wyman	had	parked his	minivan.	Overhead,	the	clouds	were	racing	past	like	the	entire	sky	was	some sort	of	time-lapse	movie.	There	wasn’t	even	a	breeze	down	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	minivan’s	seats	were	covered	with	boxes	and	garbage	bags	full	of	clothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wyman	had	to	pile	them	in	the	back	to	make	room	for	me.	“What’s	all	this?”	I asked,	sorting	through	some	shirts	that	couldn’t	ever	have	been	in	style. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jesse’s	been	cleaning	the	apartment,”	he	said,	shaking	his	head.	“She’s	making me	get	rid	of	all	the	clothes	other	women	bought	me.	My	closet’s	empty.	It’s	like I’m	eighteen	all	over	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	all	the	boxes	and	bags.	“I’ve	never	had	this	many	clothes	in	my	life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	just	can’t	bear	to	give	them	to	Goodwill	or	someplace	like	that,”	he	went	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a>“I	mean,	can	you	imagine	some	fucking	stranger	wearing	my	clothes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	drove	to	a	subdivision	in	the	north	end	of	the	city,	a	quiet	and	clean	place that	looked	as	if	it	had	been	abandoned	and	sterilized	at	daybreak.	All	the	lawns were	yellow.	Wyman	parked	in	front	of	one	of	the	houses,	in	an	empty	driveway with	dead	grass	sticking	up	through	the	cracks.	There	wasn’t	a	single	person	in sight.	I	waited	for	Wyman	to	tell	me	what	to	do,	but	he	didn’t	say	anything	or	get out.	He	just	kept	turning	in	his	seat	to	look	at	the	other	houses	surrounding	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	never	done	anything	like	this	before,”	he	finally	said,	turning	off	the minivan’s	engine	and	lighting	a	cigarette. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me	neither,”	I	said.	“But	this	was	your	idea,	remember?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	sat	there	a	moment	longer,	the	clouds	still	racing	past	overhead,	and	then Wyman	said,	“All	right	then.”	We	got	out	and	went	to	the	back	of	the	van. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wyman	emptied	out	a	couple	of	the	boxes,	tossing	the	clothes	over	the	back	seat, and	handed	them	to	me.	“Here,”	he	said.	“Take	these	to	the	side	door.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	big	of	a	stash	does	she	have?”	I	asked,	looking	into	the	empty	boxes.	They were	bleach	boxes,	at	least	two	feet	deep	and	reinforced	with	extra	glue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wyman	crawled	into	the	back	of	the	van	for	more	boxes.	“What	are	you	talking about?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	around	the	side	of	the	house,	to	an	old	wooden	door	with	a	stained	glass window.	A	mat	on	the	step	actually	had	the	word	Welcome	painted	on	it,	but	you had	to	look	close	to	see	it	under	the	dirt.	All	the	blinds	were	drawn	in	the windows	of	the	neighbouring	house,	so	I	figured	no	one	was	home	there.	I	put one	of	the	boxes	over	my	fist	and	was	drawing	it	back	to	punch	through	the stained	glass	when	Wyman	walked	around	the	corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	doing?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	we	were	breaking	into	the	place,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	like	that,”	he	said.	He	dropped	the	boxes	he	was	carrying	and	took	a	gold card	out	of	his	wallet.	I	stepped	aside	as	he	inserted	it	between	the	door	and frame.	There	was	a	soft	click,	and	then	he	pushed	the	door	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a>I	looked	around	one	more	time	before	entering	the	house.	In	one	of	the neighbour’s	windows,	a	black-and-white	cat	had	crawled	in	between	the	blinds and	the	glass.	It	sat	on	the	windowsill,	watching	us	with	unblinking	blue	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	went	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	were	in	a	kitchen	that	was	all	wooden	counters	and	shiny	steel	pots	hanging from	the	walls.	A	skylight	ran	its	entire	length,	giving	the	room	a	white	glow.	I could	hear	a	clock	ticking	somewhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks	expensive,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take	off	your	shoes,”	he	said,	bending	down	to	untie	his	own.	“I	don’t	want	to be	leaving	dirt	and	shit	all	over	the	place.	That’s	how	they	always	track	people down	in	the	cop	shows.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	kicked	off	my	shoes.	“What	about	hair	fibers	and	that	sort	of	thing?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	only	do	that	for	murders.	As	long	as	we	don’t	kill	anyone,	we’ll	be	fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	followed	Wyman	down	the	hall,	into	the	living	room.	There	was	an	Ikea	couch and	chair,	a	big-screen	Sony	television,	a	Toshiba	stereo	system,	and	some wooden	bookshelves	holding	nothing	but	videotapes	and	CDs.	The	walls	were covered	with	framed	photographs,	but	when	I	looked	closer,	I	saw	the	photos were	the	ones	that	had	come	with	the	frames. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	is	she	anyway?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who?”	Wyman	said.	He	put	the	empty	boxes	on	top	of	the	Sony	and	started looking	through	the	bookshelves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	ex-wife.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	not	here,”	he	said.	He	began	pulling	videotapes	off	a	bookshelf	and dropping	them	into	the	boxes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	see	that,”	I	said.	I	went	over	and	looked	at	the	tapes	he	was	collecting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	bore	handwritten	labels	such	as	Wedding	Day	and	Disney	World.	“I thought	we	were	here	to	steal	some	drugs,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	go	right	ahead,”	he	said.	“I’ll	be	along	in	a	minute.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a>I	wasn’t	really	sure	where	to	look	first,	so	I	went	upstairs.	There	were	only	three rooms	up	here:	two	bedrooms	and	a	bathroom	smelling	faintly	of	bleach.	I	went through	all	the	cupboards	in	the	bathroom,	but	all	I	found	was	some	toilet	paper and	tampons.	The	room	was	so	clean	I	wasn’t	sure	if	it	had	ever	been	used. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	smaller	bedroom	was	completely	empty,	nothing	but	vacuum	cleaner	marks on	the	carpet.	I	tried	the	master	bedroom	next.	It	was	sparsely	furnished,	just	a carefully	made	futon	bed,	a	black	dresser	and	two	bedside	tables	holding	chrome lamps	with	white	shades.	The	walls	were	completely	bare,	something	I’d	never seen	in	a	bedroom	before.	There	were	only	a	half-dozen	dresses	hanging	in	the closet,	so	I	went	through	the	dresser	drawers.	At	first	I	was	neat,	gently	pushing the	clothes	aside	to	look	underneath	them,	and	then	I	remembered	this	was	a robbery.	I	dumped	all	the	drawers	out	on	the	bed.	I	didn’t	find	any	drugs	but	I did	find	three	hundred-dollar	bills	tucked	inside	a	yellow	sweater.	I	put	them	in my	pocket	and	went	back	downstairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wyman	was	sitting	on	the	couch,	pulling	the	insides	out	of	a	video	tape.	“What are	you	doing?”	I	asked	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	going	to	record	over	them,”	he	said,	“but	there’s	too	many.	We’d	be	here all	day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	you	were	stealing	them,”	I	said,	indicating	the	tapes	in	the	boxes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	the	ones	I’m	in,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	into	the	kitchen	and	tossed	the	contents	of	the	cupboards	onto	the	floor, but	I	couldn’t	find	drugs	anywhere.	I	was	thirsty	by	the	time	I	was	done,	so	I grabbed	a	Heineken	from	the	fridge	and	wandered	back	into	the	living	room.	“I don’t	know,”	I	said.	“Maybe	she	knew	you	were	coming	or	something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wyman	was	still	ripping	the	insides	out	of	the	videos.	He	was	covered	in	ribbons of	the	stuff	now,	and	he’d	somehow	managed	to	cut	one	of	his	fingers,	so	little drops	of	blood	were	dropping	onto	the	carpet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	know	what	to	do,	so	I	finished	the	beer	in	a	couple	of	long	swallows, then	took	the	boxes	he’d	filled	and	went	outside.	There	was	a	bit	of	a	wind	now, but	other	than	that	everything	was	the	same.	The	cat	was	still	in	the	window, watching.	The	day	seemed	like	it	would	never	end.	I	sat	in	the	passenger	seat	of the	van	and	put	the	boxes	at	my	feet,	then	waited.	I	didn’t	want	to	go	back	into</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a>the	house.	It	took	Wyman	nearly	an	hour	to	come	out	with	the	rest	of	the	boxes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	opened	the	back	of	the	van	and	shoved	them	in,	tossing	the	loose	clothes	out on	the	lawn	to	make	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Wyman	got	back	in,	I	asked	him,	“When	do	I	get	my	money?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	just	looked	at	me	for	a	moment,	and	then	he	started	the	minivan.	We	drove away	from	there	slowly,	the	wind	pushing	his	old	clothes	across	the	dried-out lawn	behind	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">WHEN	WE	GOT	TO	Wyman’s	apartment,	his	girlfriend,	Jesse,	was	stretched out	on	their	leather	couch,	watching	Letterman	on	the	television.	She	was wearing	a	translucent	silk	nightgown	and	drinking	something	from	a	blue martini	glass.	The	television	was	a	big-screen	Sony	just	like	the	one	in	Wyman’s ex-wife’s	house.	I	decided	not	to	say	anything	about	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	doing	home	already?”	Jesse	asked	when	we	walked	in,	but Wyman	didn’t	answer	her.	Instead,	he	walked	through	the	living	room	and	down the	hall,	disappearing	into	one	of	the	bedrooms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	put	my	box	down	in	the	entranceway	and	watched	the	television	for	a	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	know	Letterman	was	on	in	the	afternoon,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	a	tape,”	Jesse	said.	She	stood	up	and	came	over	to	look	in	my	box.	This close	to	her,	I	could	see	the	little	flowers	she’d	painted	on	her	toenails	and	the Superman	tattoo	on	her	ankle.	I’d	asked	her	about	the	tattoo	once,	when	we	were dancing	together	at	a	warehouse	party,	but	all	she	told	me	was	that	it	had	cost	her an	acting	gig	in	a	beer	commercial.	Wyman	later	told	me	she’d	never	auditioned for	any	beer	commercial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	this?”	she	asked,	pulling	out	a	tape	with	the	label	Honeymoon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	I	said,	but	she	wasn’t	listening	to	me	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	she	said.	“These	are	not	coming	in	here.	Not	where	we	live.”	She	tossed the	tape	out	onto	the	front	walk	and	kicked	the	box	after	it.	“You	hear	me, Wyman?”	she	called	down	the	hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	didn’t	come	out	of	the	bedroom,	she	asked	me,	“How	could	you	let	him do	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>“I	tried	to	stop	him,”	I	said	in	a	low	voice,	“but	I	think	there’s	something	wrong with	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jesus,	there’s	no	getting	anything	past	you,	is	there?”	she	said.	She	started	to laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wyman	still	hadn’t	come	out	of	the	bedroom.	Outside,	the	wind	had	picked	up, and	now	it	looked	like	the	clouds	were	falling	right	out	of	the	sky	on	top	of	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wyman	said	he	was	going	to	give	me	some	money,”	I	told	Jesse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	she	said,	shaking	her	head.	She	pushed	me	out	onto	the	step	and	kept repeating	the	word	for	the	entire	time	it	took	her	to	close	the	door	and	lock	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	no	no	no	no	no	no	no	no	no.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">IT’S	NOT	MY	RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a>By	Peter	Darbyshire</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	WAS	ON	MY	WAY	to	the	liquor	store	when	I	passed	him	for	the	first	time.	An old	man,	fifty,	maybe	sixty,	hard	to	tell	exactly	because	his	hair	covered	most	of his	face.	He	was	lying	asleep	on	the	sidewalk	outside	the	Happy	Harbour,	a	bar where	the	lights	were	so	dim	it	looked	as	if	the	people	inside	were	underwater. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	right	in	front	of	the	door,	the	way	you	sometimes	see	dogs	outside	a place,	and	drops	of	water	from	an	air	conditioner	in	a	window	overhead	were falling	onto	his	chest.	He	was	wearing	wool	pants	and	two	ski	jackets,	even though	the	day	was	so	hot	it	felt	like	we	were	being	sucked	into	the	sun.	And there	was	a	little	margarine	container	beside	his	hand,	with	some	pieces	of	bread inside	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	liquor	store	was	at	the	end	of	the	street.	People	lay	in	the	passenger	seats	of the	cars	outside,	eyes	closed	like	they	were	unconscious.	I	spent	the	last	of	my money	on	two	six-packs	of	the	most	expensive	beer	they	had.	Kennedy	had called	that	afternoon	to	invite	me	to	his	wedding.	He’d	said	that	Rachel	was going	to	be	there.	I	thought	she	might	call. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	was	still	there	when	I	came	back	from	the	liquor	store,	only	now	there was	a	woman	with	him.	She	was	young,	twenty	or	twenty-two,	and	she	was wearing	amber	sunglasses	and	a	Calvin	Klein	baseball	cap.	When	I	walked	up, she	was	shaking	him	and	saying,	“Are	you	there?	Are	you	there?”	I	tried	to	walk past,	but	she	looked	right	at	me.	“I	can’t	wake	him	up,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	suddenly	felt	guilty,	like	it	was	my	fault	he	was	lying	there,	and	I	stopped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	probably	just	drunk,”	I	told	her.	“I	wouldn’t	worry	about	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	shouldn’t	be	sleeping	in	the	sun,”	she	said.	She	looked	around	and	shook her	head	at	the	passing	cars.	“I	can’t	believe	people	just	let	him	lie	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sure	he’s	all	right,”	I	said.	“Otherwise	someone	would	have	stopped	by now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	she	brushed	the	hair	out	of	his	face,	though,	it	was	clear	he	hadn’t	been	all right	in	some	time.	His	face	was	a	mask	of	broken	blood	vessels,	and	yellowish drool	coated	his	chin.	He	looked	as	if	he’d	exploded	inside.	The	woman	stroked the	side	of	his	face,	but	he	didn’t	even	twitch	an	eyelid.	“Who	knows	how	long he’s	been	lying	here,”	the	woman	said.	“With	people	just	walking	past.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a>“It	looks	like	he’s	breathing	regular,”	I	said.	“If	he’s	breathing	regular,	then	he’s probably	just	sleeping.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	up	at	me	and	squinted	a	little	through	her	sunglasses,	like	she	was concentrating.	Then	she	stared	back	down	at	him.	“We	should	call	someone,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	said.	“Paramedics	or	somebody	like	that.	They’ll	take	him	to	a	shelter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someplace	cool,	where	he	can	sleep	and	not	have	to	worry	about	exposure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	choice	of	words	implied	I	was	in	this	with	her,	so	I	put	my	beer	down	in	the shade	at	the	side	of	the	building	and	squatted	down	on	the	other	side	of	the	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	studied	his	chest	for	a	moment.	It	didn’t	move	much,	but	when	it	did,	it	was regular.	I	thought	about	shaking	him	myself,	but	I	didn’t	really	want	to	touch him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	should	call	someone,”	the	woman	said	again.	When	I	looked	at	her,	I	saw her	skin	was	all	flushed	and	she	was	shaking	a	little.	She	kept	biting	her	lower lip,	like	she	was	actually	worried	about	this	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	about	Rachel	calling,	maybe	right	at	this	very	moment.	And	then	I thought	about	answering	the	phone	and	telling	her	how	I’d	saved	the	life	of someone	I	didn’t	even	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	AIR	INSIDE	the	Happy	Harbour	was	cool	and	wet.	There	were	five	or	six men	sitting	around	a	table	in	the	middle	of	the	room,	with	maybe	two	dozen	beer bottles	occupying	the	spaces	between	them.	I	didn’t	recognize	any	of	the	labels on	the	bottles.	The	men	looked	away	from	the	television	over	the	bar	and	at	us	as we	entered,	and	their	conversation	drifted	away,	if	there	had	been	one	in	the	first place.	Then	one	of	them,	an	old	man	with	no	front	teeth,	took	off	his	John	Deere cap	and	slapped	the	empty	chair	beside	him	with	it.	“Plenty	of	room	here,”	he said.	He	was	looking	directly	at	the	woman.	The	others	didn’t	say	anything,	just looked	at	us	with	eyes	that	reminded	me	of	dead	fish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	went	over	to	the	bar,	where	a	Korean	man	wearing	mirrored	sunglasses	was sitting	on	a	stool,	reading	the	paper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	an	unconscious	man	in	front	of	your	bar,”	I	told	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	he’s	been	there	for	about	half	an	hour,”	he	said.	He	didn’t	look	up	from the	paper. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>“And	you	just	left	him	there?”	the	woman	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	he	stared	at	her.	She	looked	into	his	glasses	for	a	moment,	then	at	me,	then down	at	the	floor.	But	that	look	had	put	me	in	charge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	wasn’t	drinking	here,”	the	Korean	guy	said.	“It’s	not	my	…”	He	searched for	the	word.	“Responsibility.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	he	just	needs	a	kiss,	darling,”	the	man	in	the	John	Deere	cap	said.	“Like Prince	Charming.”	His	laugh	turned	into	a	long	series	of	coughs.	No	one	else	at the	table	made	a	sound.	They	stared	at	us	like	they	were	all	mute.	And	they weren’t	all	old	either.	There	was	a	man	in	a	UPS	uniform	who	looked	like	he was	around	my	age,	and	there	was	another	man	in	shorts	and	a	T-shirt	who looked	like	he	couldn’t	even	have	been	legal	drinking	age	yet.	For	some	reason, he	kept	grinning	at	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	need	to	call	the	police,”	I	told	the	Korean	guy.	“Otherwise	he	could	die	or something.	Because	of	the	heat	and	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	wasn’t	drinking	here,”	the	Korean	guy	said	again	and	returned	to	the	paper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	the	woman.	I	was	hoping	that	she’d	tell	me	to	forget	it,	that	she’d walk	outside	and	down	the	street	without	once	looking	back.	We’d	tried,	at	least. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	she	kept	on	staring	at	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	went	over	to	the	pay	phone	in	the	corner	and	I	dropped	in	a	quarter,	dialed 911.	We	both	watched	the	traffic	outside	as	I	waited	for	someone	to	pick	up.	A postman	walked	past	the	man	outside	without	even	glancing	down	at	him.	A woman	answered	after	the	third	ring.	“911,”	she	said.	She	was	laughing	about something.	“Do	you	need	the	police,	ambulance	or	fire	department?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	need	somebody	to	take	away	an	unconscious	man,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	moment	please.”	I	waited	through	three	more	rings.	A	couple	of	the	men	at the	table	-	the	young	guy	and	an	old	black	guy	who	looked	as	if	he’d	been	a weightlifter	once	but	now	seemed	to	be	the	victim	of	some	sort	of	slow,	flesh-eating	disease	-	were	still	watching	us.	They	were	whispering	back	and	forth	and nodding	at	each	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ambulance	services,”	another	woman	said	in	my	ear.	“How	can	I	help	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a>“There’s	an	unconscious	man	on	the	sidewalk,”	I	said.	“I	tried	to	wake	him	up, but	he’s	out	cold.	He’s	been	there	for	hours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	old	is	he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	he’s	old,	maybe	fifty	or	sixty.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	on	the	other	end	laughed.	“You	call	that	old?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never	mind,”	she	said.	“Just	give	me	the	location.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	told	her	the	address	and	then	hung	up.	“Okay,	help	is	on	the	way,”	I	said.	We went	outside	again	and	waited	by	the	old	man.	The	people	driving	past	looked	at us,	looked	at	him	lying	there,	but	no	one	stopped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	while,	the	black	man	came	out	of	the	bar	and	stretched.	I	could	hear	his joints	popping.	Then	he	gently	took	hold	of	the	old	man’s	arms	and	dragged	him a	few	feet	to	the	side	of	the	doorway,	up	against	the	wall	of	the	neighbouring convenience	store.	“Gus	doesn’t	want	him	on	the	property,”	he	explained	to	us with	a	shy	smile,	before	going	back	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	shouldn’t	have	moved	him,”	the	woman	said.	“You’re	not	supposed	to	move people	when	you	don’t	know	what’s	wrong	with	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	that’s	only	for	people	with	broken	backs	and	stuff	like	that,”	I	said.	“I think	this	guy’s	problems	are	far	different	from	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	heard	sirens	in	the	distance	around	the	same	time	the	young	man	came	outside and	lit	a	cigarette.	Up	close,	I	could	see	his	white	shirt	had	been	washed	so	many times	that	it	was	now	turning	grey.	He	looked	up	and	down	the	street,	but	his eyes	kept	coming	back	to	the	woman.	I	stood	in	between	them,	and	he	smiled, pulled	a	pair	of	sunglasses	from	his	pocket	and	put	them	on.	They	looked	like the	kind	of	sunglasses	you’d	buy	at	a	gas	station. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here	they	come,”	the	woman	said	needlessly	when	the	ambulance	came	around the	corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	started	to	lift	my	hand,	but	the	young	guy	stepped	in	front	of	me	and	pointed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a>the	old	man	with	both	arms,	like	one	of	those	guys	at	the	airport	directing	planes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ambulance	drove	up	onto	the	sidewalk	beside	us,	almost	hitting	the	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	same	time,	a	fire	truck	came	around	the	corner	from	the	other	direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	the	people	driving	past	slowed	their	cars	to	watch	us,	and	a	few	people standing	at	the	traffic	lights	down	the	street	began	walking	our	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	paramedics	came	out	of	the	ambulance	fast	but	slowed	down	when	they	saw the	old	man.	Both	wore	latex	gloves	and	belt	holsters	carrying	scissors.	The	one who	opened	the	back	doors	of	the	ambulance	had	a	grey	beard	even	though	his hair	was	brown.	The	other	one	walked	in	between	us	to	kneel	beside	the	old man.	He	was	wearing	knee	pads	the	same	colour	as	his	uniform. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	been	like	this	for	half	an	hour,”	the	woman	told	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	tried	to	wake	him	up,”	the	young	guy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	tried,”	I	said,	but	the	paramedic	didn’t	pay	attention	to	any	of	us.	He	held the	old	man’s	wrist	loosely	between	his	fingers,	like	he	didn’t	want	to	touch	him either,	and	looked	at	his	watch	for	a	while. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gus	came	out	and	squinted	at	the	fire	truck	as	it	pulled	up	in	front	of	the	bar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	no	fire	here,”	he	said	to	me.	“Why’d	you	call	them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	call	them,”	I	said,	but	he	just	shook	his	head	and	went	back	inside, closing	the	door	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both	paramedics	were	kneeling	on	the	ground	now,	and	the	bearded	one	was shaking	the	old	man	by	the	shoulder.	“I	hate	these	calls,”	he	said.	I	wasn’t	sure who	he	was	talking	to,	though,	because	the	first	paramedic	didn’t	pay	him	any attention	either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	firemen	climbed	down	off	the	fire	truck	and	came	over.	They	were	wearing those	fire-resistant	pants	and	boots	but	no	jackets,	only	Tshirts.	All	these	people to	help	one	man.	I	almost	couldn’t	believe	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	all	right,”	I	told	them.	“We’ve	got	it	under	control.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	glanced	at	me	and	then	looked	down	at	the	old	man.	They	didn’t	say anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a>“You	live	around	here?”	I	heard	the	young	guy	ask	the	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	probably	just	heat-stroked,”	I	said	to	the	watching	crowd,	which	now numbered	six	or	seven	people.	“He	just	needs	to	sleep	it	off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	old	man	chose	that	moment	to	wake	up.	He	half	sat	and	looked	around	at	all of	us,	then	pulled	the	margarine	container	of	bread	to	his	chest	with	both	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	see?”	the	bearded	paramedic	said	to	his	partner,	but	I	didn’t	know	what that	meant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	are	you	feeling?”	the	other	one	asked.	The	old	man	didn’t	answer.	He	kept staring	at	the	gloves	on	their	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bearded	paramedic	sighed	and	went	over	to	the	ambulance,	closed	its	back doors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aren’t	you	taking	him	to	the	hospital?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	firemen	-	a	short,	squat	man	with	a	sunburned	face	and	a	lazy	eye	-</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	over	to	me.	“You	the	one	that	called	this	in?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	glanced	around.	Everyone	was	watching	me.	“That’s	right,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you	couldn’t	wake	him	up?”	The	lazy	eye	drifted	away	from	me,	staring somewhere	over	my	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	we	tried.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	he	appears	to	be	awake	now.”	He	walked	back	to	the	fire	truck,	his partner	following	along	behind	him.	They	climbed	up	into	the	cab	but	then didn’t	move,	just	sat	there	like	they	were	waiting	for	another	call. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bearded	paramedic	had	put	on	a	pair	of	Ray-Bans	now	and	was	leaning against	the	side	of	the	ambulance,	his	arms	folded	across	his	chest.	His	partner was	still	talking	to	the	old	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	been	drinking?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	old	man	shook	his	head	and	smiled,	then	swiped	one	hand	slowly	over	his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a>face,	the	way	a	cat	does	when	it	cleans	itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	been	taking	any	drugs?	Methadone?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	old	man	shook	his	head	and	smiled	again,	did	the	same	thing	with	his	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	got	a	place	to	stay?	Relatives?	Shelter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	old	man	took	a	piece	of	bread	out	of	his	container	and	nibbled	it,	looked around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	going	to	take	him	somewhere,	aren’t	you?”	the	woman	asked	the paramedic.	“Where	he	can	recover?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	paramedic	looked	at	her.	“Recover	from	what?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	old	man	pulled	himself	up	the	wall	to	his	feet,	hid	the	bread	somewhere inside	one	of	his	jackets.	He	smiled	even	wider	now.	He	seemed	to	be	missing every	second	tooth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	black	man	and	the	one	wearing	the	John	Deere	cap	had	come	outside sometime	during	all	of	this.	They	were	still	holding	their	beer	bottles	in	their hands.	“What’s	all	the	commotion?”	the	one	in	the	cap	demanded	of	the paramedics.	“We	have	a	police	state	now?	Man	can’t	even	take	a	nap	when	he feels	the	need?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	not	what’s	going	on	here,”	I	said,	but	he	just	waved	his	bottle	in	my direction	and	went	on	talking.	“You	cops,”	he	said.	“You	just	won’t	leave	a	man alone,	will	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	get	out	of	here,”	the	bearded	paramedic	said,	and	his	partner	finally nodded.	He	put	on	a	pair	of	Ray-Bans	himself,	and	the	two	of	them	got	into	the ambulance.	I	wondered	if	the	city	supplied	their	sunglasses,	if	it	had	some	sort	of contract	with	Ray-Ban,	or	if	they	had	simply	decided	to	buy	matching	pairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	turned	around	again,	the	woman	was	gone,	and	the	other	members	of	the crowd	were	wandering	off,	back	in	the	direction	of	the	traffic	lights.	“Someone could	have	been	dying	somewhere,”	the	black	man	said	to	me,	and	then	he	and the	others	from	the	bar	went	back	inside.	It	was	just	me	and	the	old	man	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a>He	watched	the	ambulance	drive	down	the	street	and,	when	it	turned	the	corner, he	sat	down	again.	He	didn’t	look	at	me,	just	squinted	up	at	the	sun	and	yawned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Started	humming	and	swaying	a	little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stepped	around	the	side	of	the	building	to	get	my	beer.	It	was	gone.	I	looked over	at	the	fire	truck,	but	none	of	the	firemen	looked	my	way	as	it	pulled	into	the traffic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	see	who	took	my	beer?”	I	asked	the	old	man,	but	he	just	shook	his head	and	closed	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	inside	the	Happy	Harbour.	Everyone	was	sitting	around	the	table	again, and	the	man	in	the	John	Deere	cap	was	telling	some	story	about	the	time	he’d gotten	into	the	back	of	a	police	car	because	he	thought	it	was	a	cab.	He	stopped when	I	walked	in,	though,	and	they	all	turned	to	look	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Someone	took	my	beer,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	didn’t	order	a	beer,”	Gus	said	from	behind	the	counter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	right,”	the	man	in	the	cap	said.	“You	just	came	in	to	use	the	phone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Remember?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Someone	took	the	beer	I	put	down	outside,”	I	said.	“Two	six-packs.	I	put	them down	in	the	shade	and	someone	walked	off	with	them.”	I	kept	watching	the young	guy.	He	wouldn’t	stop	smiling	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	bet	it	was	that	drunk	outside,”	the	man	in	the	cap	said.	“He	probably	needed	a drink	to	get	back	to	sleep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	try	and	help	a	man	out,”	I	said,	“and	this	is	the	way	society	treats	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take	it	somewhere	else,”	Gus	said	from	behind	the	bar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	should	grow	up,”	I	told	the	young	guy.	“And	you	should	do	it	fast.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	smile	pulled	back	to	show	all	his	teeth,	“What	are	you	saying,	man?”	he asked.	He	got	to	his	feet.	“What	are	you	saying?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey	hey	hey,”	Gus	said.	“You	get	out	of	here,”	he	told	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>“Maybe	I	should	call	the	cops,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	get	out	of	here	now,”	Gus	told	me,	“or	I’ll	call	the	cops	on	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">HAPPILY	EVER	AFTER,	I	GUESS</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>By	Peter	Darbyshire</p>
<p class="calibre1">THIS	IS	THE	STORY	of	how	Rachel	and	I	got	married. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	we	moved	in	together,	I	had	to	look	for	a	new	job.	The	hospital	had stopped	calling	us	in	after	that	accident	in	their	Emergency	area,	and	we	were almost	out	of	money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	got	up	at	eight	in	the	morning	every	day	and	showered	and	dressed	in	my	nicest clothes.	I	made	myself	a	lunch	and	Rachel	kissed	me	on	the	cheek	as	I	went	out the	door.	It	was	like	I	was	really	going	to	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	a	routine.	I	went	to	the	variety	store	at	the	end	of	the	street	and	bought	a paper	and	a	coffee.	Then	I	went	another	block	over,	to	a	park	between	a	dollar store	and	a	row	of	houses	with	boarded-up	windows.	I	sat	on	a	bench	and	drank my	coffee,	looked	over	the	classifieds.	Rachel	had	given	me	her	lucky	pen	to circle	ads	with,	but	there	was	never	anything	I	was	qualified	for. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	fenced-off	playground	in	one	corner	of	the	park.	There	were	maybe a	dozen	children	that	played	in	there	every	day,	and	a	pair	of	women	who watched	them.	There	were	always	another	five	or	six	people	and	their	dogs	in the	opposite	corner	of	the	park.	The	people	drank	coffee	and	talked	while	the dogs	fought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	there	was	another	man	with	a	paper	who	sat	on	a	bench	near	mine.	He	was there	every	day	by	the	time	I	arrived.	He	wore	a	suit	and	read	the	entire	paper, not	just	the	classifieds.	The	first	day	I	was	there,	he	saved	my	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	dogs	from	the	other	end	of	the	park	-	a	large	Rottweiler	-	came running	over	when	I	sat	down	on	the	bench.	It	stopped	a	few	feet	away	from	me and	started	growling.	I	looked	at	the	people	with	the	rest	of	the	dogs,	but	they were	still	talking	to	each	other	and	waving	their	coffee	cups	in	the	air.	With	each growl,	the	dog	moved	closer	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	doesn’t	know	you,”	the	man	in	the	suit	called	out	to	me.	“It	thinks	you’re	a stranger.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	a	stranger,”	I	said,	and	the	dog	moved	closer.	It	was	almost	touching	me now. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a>“Just	give	it	something	so	it	knows	you’re	friendly,”	the	man	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	have	anything	but	my	lunch,	a	sandwich	in	plastic	wrap.	I	dropped	it	to the	ground.	The	Rottweiler	gave	me	one	last	growl,	then	picked	up	the	sandwich in	its	jaws	and	ran	back	to	the	other	dogs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	was	a	close	one,”	I	said	to	the	man	in	the	suit,	but	he	just	nodded	and turned	to	the	business	section	of	the	paper.	I	watched	the	Rottweiler	eat	my lunch	on	the	other	side	of	the	park,	and	then	I	watched	the	clouds	shift	back	and forth	overhead	for	a	while.	When	I	looked	at	my	watch,	it	wasn’t	even	ten	yet.	I wandered	over	to	the	playground	and	leaned	on	the	fence	there.	The	kids	didn’t notice	me,	but	the	two	women	watching	them	did.	They	stopped	talking	and	kept glancing	my	way,	as	if	I	was	going	to	run	off	with	one	of	the	kids	if	they	stopped looking	at	me	for	even	a	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	made	me	wonder	how	I	would	have	turned	out	if	I’d	had	somebody	like	that watching	out	for	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">DURING	THIS	TIME,	Rachel	began	working	for	a	chat	line,	the	kind	you	see advertised	on	television	after	midnight.	She	told	me	about	it	when	we	were watching	a	movie	in	bed	one	night,	and	I	asked	her	if	it	was	one	of	those phonesex	jobs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	no,	it’s	nothing	like	that,”	she	said.	“I’m	just	going	to	be	talking	to	people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	muted	the	television	and	sat	up.	“You’re	going	to	be	talking	to	people?”	I asked.	“Or	you’re	going	to	be	talking	to	men?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Women	don’t	really	call	these	lines,”	she	said.	“That’s	why	they’re	hiring	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	why	do	the	men	call?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,”	she	said,	taking	the	remote	from	my	hand	and	turning	the	volume	back up,	“one	of	us	has	to	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	worked	the	night	shift	at	the	chat	line.	She	took	the	bus	to	the	call	center, which	was	in	this	old	hotel	at	the	edge	of	downtown.	The	company	she	worked for	had	made	some	deal	to	rent	an	entire	floor,	and	each	of	the	operators	had	a separate	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a>“It’s	like	you’re	a	prostitute	or	something,”	I	said	when	she	told	me	about	it	over breakfast	after	her	first	shift. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	helps	me	get	into	character,”	she	said.	“I	even	have	a	name.	Velma.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	kind	of	name	is	that?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	it’s	supposed	to	be	Russian,”	she	said.	She	spoke	in	a	thick	accent	that didn’t	sound	like	anything	I’d	ever	heard	before.	“Russians	are	in	style	these days.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	everyone	there	Russian?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	we	have	a	couple	of	Asians,	a	German,	an	Australian,	even	a	Brazilian.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed.	“But	everyone	playing	them	is	white.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	to	the	counter	and	poured	myself	a	coffee,	then	went	over	to	the	kitchen window.	It	looked	out	onto	the	street,	and	for	a	while	I	watched	people	go	past	in buses	or	cars,	on	their	way	to	or	from	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	kind	of	calls	do	you	get?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	had	this	one	guy	who	wanted	to	talk	about	his	mother,”	she	said.	“Then	he asked	all	sorts	of	questions	about	mine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	back	to	her.	“What	else	did	he	ask	about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	want	to	know,”	she	said,	shaking	her	head	and	laughing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I	do,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	you	don’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">AFTER	I’D	GONE	to	the	park	another	few	days,	the	man	in	the	suit	offered	me a	cigarette.	I	went	over	and	took	it,	even	though	I	don’t	smoke,	and	sat	on	the corner	of	his	bench.	The	Rottweiler	chased	a	Lab	across	the	park	to	us,	and	for	a moment	both	stopped	to	sniff	at	our	ankles.	I	was	ready	to	give	them	my sandwich,	but	they	moved	on	without	even	growling	at	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	what	do	you	do?”	I	asked	the	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a>He	watched	the	dogs	a	moment	before	answering.	“I’m	a	broker,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stocks?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Something	like	that,”	he	said.	He	looked	at	me.	“What	about	you?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	self-employed,”	I	told	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right	then,”	he	said,	nodding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	sat	there	in	silence	for	a	moment,	him	smoking	and	me	pretending	to	smoke, and	then	I	asked,	“So	how	long	have	you	been	coming	here	for?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	all	around	the	park	now,	and	for	a	moment	he	didn’t	answer.	Then	he said,	“About	a	month.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	she	hasn’t	figured	it	out	yet?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	savings,”	he	said.	“I	can	probably	go	another	month.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	then	what?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	then?”	He	blew	smoke	at	the	sky.	“Then	I	guess	it’s	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	I	can	go	that	long,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	you’ll	be	surprised	what	you’re	capable	of,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	do	when	it	rains?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	drive,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Drive	where?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nowhere.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	didn’t	say	anything	else	until	the	cigarettes	were	finished,	and	then	I	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	of	us	should	bring	a	chess	set	or	something	like	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	would	we	want	to	do	that?”	he	asked,	looking	back	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a>“You	know,	to	pass	the	time,”	I	said.	“We	could	be	like	those	people	you	see	on television,	the	ones	that	play	chess	in	parks	all	day	long.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	this	isn’t	a	permanent	kind	of	thing,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	it	could	be,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	still	working,	in	a	way,”	he	said.	He	patted	the	paper	beside	him.	“I’m keeping	up	with	the	stocks.	In	case	they	call	me	back.”	When	I	didn’t	say anything,	he	added,	“Or	in	case	someone	else	calls	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have	you	applied	for	any	other	jobs?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	doing	lots	of	research,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I	still	think	we	could	play	chess	or	something,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	picked	up	the	paper	again.	“I’m	not	one	of	those	people,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	got	up	and	went	over	to	the	playground	again.	One	of	the	women	came	over	to where	I	leaned	on	the	fence,	but	she	was	careful	to	stay	out	of	arm’s	reach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	I	help	you	with	something?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	looking	for	help?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	mean?”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	need	a	job,”	I	told	her.	“And	I’m	good	with	kids.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	get	back	to	you	on	that,”	she	said	and	walked	back	to	join	the	other	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	boy	of	maybe	five	or	six	went	down	the	slide.	When	he	reached	the	bottom,	he looked	at	me.	I	waved	at	him	and	he	waved	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	talk	to	strangers,”	the	woman	who’d	spoken	to	me	told	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	a	stranger,”	I	called	over	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	boy	stared	at	me	until	the	woman	came	over	to	stand	between	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a>“Ask	the	dogs,”	I	told	her.	“They	know	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you	don’t	leave	now,”	she	said,	“I’m	calling	the	police.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">RACHEL	STARTED	OFF	slow	at	her	new	job,	only	two	or	three	nights	a	week, but	it	wasn’t	long	before	she	was	up	to	five	or	six	nights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“People	have	been	requesting	me,”	she	told	me	as	she	was	getting	ready	for work	one	night.	“They’ve	been	phoning	the	main	line	and	asking	for	my	home number.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	not	going	to	be	calling	here,	are	they?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	just	going	to	work	more	shifts,”	she	said,	putting	on	her	coat.	“We	may even	try	some	different	personalities.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	would	you	do	that?”	I	asked.	“It	sounds	like	enough	men	are	calling	you now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	want	to	get	the	ones	that	aren’t	calling,”	she	said,	kissing	me	on	the	cheek and	walking	out	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	barely	saw	her	at	all.	I	slept	alone	in	the	bed	most	nights,	and	when	she	came home,	I	got	up	to	go	look	for	work.	Once,	she	came	home	and	stood	at	the	foot of	the	bed,	watching	me	until	I	woke	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	doing?”	I	asked,	sitting	up	and	staring	back	at	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	thinking	about	you	last	night	when	I	was	talking	to	this	guy,”	she	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“and	I	forgot	what	you	looked	like.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	maybe	two	weeks	of	this,	I	asked	her	what	kind	of	men	were	calling.	I	was taking	a	bath,	and	she	was	sitting	on	the	edge	of	the	tub.	“Are	they	all unemployed?”	I	asked.	“Are	any	of	them	calling	from	jail	or	anything	like	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	put	a	hand	in	the	water	and	moved	it	around	but	didn’t	touch	me.	“Most	of them	are	businessmen,”	she	said.	“At	least,	that’s	what	they	tell	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	kind	of	businessmen?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a>“Executives	away	from	home	on	business,”	she	said.	“CEOs	taking	a	break	at the	office.	That	sort	of	thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stared	at	her	but	didn’t	say	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“These	calls	are	expensive,”	she	said,	taking	her	hand	out	of	the	water	and drying	it	on	her	pant	leg.	“Not	everybody	can	afford	to	talk	to	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	STOPPED	GOING	to	the	park	after	the	incident	with	the	man	in	the	minivan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	first	time	I	met	him,	he	cruised	around	the	park	twice,	looking	in	at	us, before	he	parked	on	the	side	of	the	street.	He	sat	there	for	another	few	minutes before	he	finally	turned	the	engine	off	and	got	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	walked	right	up	to	me	and	stood	between	me	and	the	sun,	so	that	when	I looked	up	at	him,	I	couldn’t	see	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How’d	you	like	to	make	a	hundred	bucks?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	do	I	have	to	kill?”	I	said,	but	he	didn’t	laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	went	back	to	his	van.	There	was	a	baby	seat	sitting	loose	in	the	back,	and	a couple	of	brightly	coloured	plastic	rings.	The	man	in	the	suit	watched	as	we drove	away.	I	waved	at	him,	but	he	just	looked	back	at	his	paper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	what’s	this	all	about?”	I	asked	the	other	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	just	need	you	to	do	something	for	me,”	he	said.	He	kept	checking	all	his mirrors,	like	he	thought	someone	was	following	us.	“It	won’t	take	long,”	he added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	drove	us	a	few	streets	over,	to	a	postal	station.	He	parked	in	the	lot	and looked	all	around	one	more	time.	Then	he	reached	into	his	pocket	and	took	out	a driver’s	licence.	“I	want	you	to	go	inside	and	open	a	post-office	box,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ll	ask	you	for	ID.	Give	them	this.”	He	handed	me	the	licence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	it	and	looked	at	the	photo.	It	was	a	man	with	a	beard	and	glasses.	I	didn’t look	anything	like	him.	Neither	did	the	other	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	some	sort	of	fraud,	right?”	I	asked	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a>“They	don’t	usually	look	at	the	card	all	that	closely,”	he	said.	“If	they	do,	just	tell them	you	shaved	the	beard	since	you	got	your	licence.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	if	they	don’t	believe	me?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	run,”	he	said.	“But	don’t	run	back	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	inside	and	registered	for	the	post-office	box.	The	woman	who	filled	out the	forms	and	gave	me	the	key	didn’t	even	look	at	the	photo	on	the	licence,	just wrote	down	the	number.	I	was	back	in	the	van	in	under	ten	minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	is	this	guy	anyway?”	I	asked,	handing	over	the	licence	and	the	key.	“Is	he dead?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	no,	it’s	nothing	like	that,”	the	other	man	said,	looking	around	the	parking lot.	“I	just	borrowed	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,”	I	said.	“Whatever.	Where’s	my	money?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	took	out	his	wallet,	which	was	bulging	with	money,	and	paid	me	in	twenties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	looked	like	there	was	a	thousand	dollars	in	there,	and	maybe	a	dozen	credit cards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jesus,”	I	said.	“I	should	just	rob	you	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	he	laughed.	“Where	can	I	drop	you	off?”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	CALLED	THE	CHAT	LINE	Rachel	worked	for.	I	bought	a	phone	card	at	the convenience	store	down	the	street,	so	she	wouldn’t	be	able	to	track	it	to	me.	I turned	off	all	the	lights	in	the	bedroom	and	muted	the	television,	then	called	the number.	When	a	woman	whose	voice	I	didn’t	recognize	answered,	I	hung	up.	I called	back	until	I	got	Rachel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who’s	this?”	she	said	when	she	came	on	the	line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	Jack,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jack,”	she	said,	and	I	could	tell	from	the	tone	of	her	voice	that	she	was	smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	Velma,	Jack.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a>“Hello,	Velma.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	Jack.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	creaking	in	the	background,	which	I	took	to	be	the	springs	of	the bed	in	the	hotel	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	what	do	you	do,	Jack?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	mean?”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	kind	of	job	do	you	have?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	say	anything	for	a	moment.	Then	I	said,	“I’m	a	broker.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	MAN	WITH	THE	VAN	came	back	the	day	after	I	first	worked	for	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	time	he	waited	in	the	van,	its	engine	running.	I	went	over	and	opened	the door.	“Have	you	got	another	job	for	me?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	smiled	but	didn’t	say	anything.	I	got	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	drove	across	the	city,	to	a	discount	mall.	He	parked	in	front	of	an	appliance store	and	took	a	gold	card	from	his	pocket,	handed	it	to	me.	I	looked	at	the	name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Veronica	Young,	it	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here’s	a	list	of	what	I	want,”	he	said,	giving	me	a	slip	of	paper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	it	but	didn’t	look	at	it.	“But	this	is	a	woman,”	I	said,	indicating	the	credit card. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	they	ask,	say	it’s	your	wife,”	he	said.	“But	they	probably	won’t	ask.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	happens	if	I	get	caught	doing	this?”	I	asked.	“Who	exactly	is	breaking	the law	here,	is	it	me	or	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	they	call	anybody,	then	run,”	he	said.	“But	remember,	don’t	run	back	to	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	into	the	store	and	looked	at	the	list.	A	television.	Laptop	computer.	CD</p>
<p class="calibre1">player.	There	was	a	list	of	specs	beside	each	one.	I	found	a	man	who	worked there	in	one	of	the	aisles	and	gave	him	the	list.	“This	is	what	I	need,”	I	said.	“For my	wife.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a>He	helped	me	load	up	a	cart	with	the	boxes	and	I	took	it	to	the	cash	area.	The woman	who	rang	everything	through	didn’t	look	at	me	or	the	card.	I	had	to	leave the	cart	in	the	store,	so	I	carried	everything	just	outside	the	door	and	waited	for the	man	in	the	van	to	pick	me	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	loaded	the	boxes	into	the	back	of	the	van,	beside	the	baby	seat.	“If	you	want me	to	keep	doing	this,”	I	said,	“you’re	going	to	have	to	pay	me	more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	smiled	at	me	again.	“Just	a	couple	of	days	on	the	job,”	he	said,	“and	already you’re	asking	for	a	raise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	PAID	RENT	with	the	money	that	I	made	working	during	the	days.	When Rachel	asked	me	where	the	money	came	from,	I	told	her	I	had	some	money	in savings.	What	I	didn’t	spend	on	rent,	I	spent	on	phone	cards	so	I	could	talk	to	her at	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	liked	to	talk	to	her	about	my	job.	That	is,	I	liked	to	talk	to	her	about	Jack’s	job. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	administer	various	funds,”	I	told	her	when	she	asked	what	was	involved	in being	a	broker.	“I	make	sure	we’re	always	getting	the	highest	returns	on	our investments.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	doesn’t	sound	very	exciting,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not,”	I	said.	“But	with	my	salary,	I	can	buy	whatever	I	want.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	sounds	much	better,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	fact,	I’d	like	to	buy	you	dinner	some	night,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	we	barely	know	each	other,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	better	way,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	would	we	go?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	of	the	places	downtown,”	I	said.	“The	kind	where	you	can	only	get	in	if they	know	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	do	they	know	you?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>“They	all	know	me,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	dress	codes	and	all	that?”	she	said.	“I	don’t	really	have	anything fancy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	buy	you	a	nice	dress,”	I	said.	“Wherever	you	want.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	designer	boutique,”	she	said.	“I’ve	always	wanted	to	shop	at	one	of	those.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine,”	I	said.	“Then	we’ll	go	out	to	dinner.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Someplace	with	martinis,”	she	said.	“If	you’re	in	a	fancy	dress,	you	should	be drinking	martinis.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	people	doing	drugs	in	the	bathroom.	The	good	kind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	we	eat	the	most	expensive	meal	they	have,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	would	that	be?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Something	from	another	country,”	I	said.	“Something	endangered.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	for	dessert,”	she	said,	“something	flaming.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	pay	for	it	all,”	I	said,	“and	then	I	take	you	back	to	your	place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	move	quick,	don’t	you?”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	I	kiss	you	on	the	doorstep,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fresh,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	then	-”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	then	I	go	inside,”	she	said.	“Alone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	have	to	leave	something	for	the	next	date,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a>I	WORKED	EVERY	DAY	for	the	man	with	the	van.	We	bought	things	all	over town	with	his	credit	cards,	opened	more	post-office	boxes,	even	went	into	banks and	cleaned	out	people’s	accounts	with	their	own	bank	cards.	I	was	making	more money	working	for	him	than	any	other	job	I’d	ever	had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	day,	as	we	drove	away	from	a	Wal-Mart	with	a	load	of	vacuum	cleaners,	I asked	him	what	his	wife	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	mean?”	he	asked,	staring	into	the	rear-view	mirror. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does	she	work?	Does	she	stay	at	home	with	the	kids?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	wife?”	he	asked.	“What	kids?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	have	kids?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	makes	you	think	that?”	he	said,	looking	at	me	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	baby	seat	in	the	back,”	I	said.	“I	thought	…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	laughed	and	shook	his	head.	“What	makes	you	think	this	van	is	mine?”	he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">ONE	NIGHT,	WHILE	we	were	eating	dinner	and	watching	television	before Rachel	had	to	go	to	work,	I	asked	her	if	she’d	had	any	interesting	calls	lately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	this	broker	who	keeps	calling	me,”	she	said,	not	taking	her	eyes	off	the television.	“He	asked	me	out	on	a	date	the	other	night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	did	you	tell	him?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	told	him	no,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	she	turned	to	look	at	me.	“Isn’t	that	what	I	should	have	told	him?”	she asked	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	back	at	the	television.	“So,”	she	said,	“how’s	the	job	hunt	going?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a>“It’s	tough	out	there,”	I	said.	“No	one’s	hiring.”	When	she	didn’t	say	anything,	I added,	“I	might	have	some	interviews	next	week.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	would	be	good,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	I	said.	“It	would.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	say	anything	else	for	a	moment.	Then	I	said,	“So	tell	me	what	this	broker is	like.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">BUT	I	HAVEN’T	TOLD	YOU	about	the	incident	with	the	other	man	yet,	the	one that	made	me	stop	working	for	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	picked	me	up	at	the	park	one	morning	but	then	didn’t	take	me	anywhere.	We just	drove	around	the	neighbourhood	again	and	again.	We	went	past	where	I lived	twice,	and	I	imagined	Rachel	inside,	sleeping	in	the	bed	I	had	just	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	not	a	cop,	are	you?”	the	man	asked	after	we’d	been	doing	this	for	maybe twenty	minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“After	all	we’ve	been	through,”	I	said,	“you	could	think	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	had	to	ask,”	he	said.	We	drove	around	in	silence	for	a	few	minutes	more.	Then he	asked,	“So	what	do	you	charge,	anyway?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	mean?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know,”	he	said.	“When	you’re	working.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	I	actually	hear	what	I	think	I’m	hearing?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	all	right,”	he	said.	“I’m	not	a	cop	either.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	did	you	get	the	idea	that	I	was	…”	I	didn’t	know	what	to	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	you	were	in	that	park,”	he	said,	looking	at	me.	“I	thought	you	were working.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wasn’t	working,”	I	said,	“I	was	looking	for	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	the	difference?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a>“Oh,	there’s	a	whole	world	of	difference,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyway,”	he	went	on.	“What	do	you	charge?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	not	what	I	do,”	I	said.	“You	couldn’t	pay	me	enough.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	if	I	gave	you	everything	in	my	wallet,”	he	said.	“Would	that	be enough?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	NEXT	TIME	I	called	Velma,	I	asked	her	to	marry	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	a	bit	sudden,”	she	said.	“We	haven’t	even	met	in	person.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	feel	like	I	know	you,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	I’m	ready	for	marriage,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	even	got	a	ring,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	got	a	ring	already?”	she	asked.	“But	I	haven’t	even	said	yes	yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you	will,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	do	you	know?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	this	is	my	call,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	would	we	do	if	we	were	married?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	I	said.	“Happily	ever	after,	I	guess.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	that	doesn’t	sound	so	bad,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	don’t	we	meet	somewhere?”	I	said.	“In	real	life?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	sure	if	I’m	ready	for	that	kind	of	commitment,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>“When’s	your	next	night	off?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tomorrow,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	meet	you	at	the	mall	downtown,”	I	said.	“The	south	entrance.	Six	o’clock.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	will	you	know	what	I	look	like?”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	know,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,”	she	said.	“Maybe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	don’t	tell	your	boyfriend	about	this,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	said	I	had	a	boyfriend?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	REALLY	DID	have	a	ring.	I’d	bought	it	from	an	old	man	in	the	street.	He’d been	trying	to	sell	it	for	months.	Every	day	he	stood	in	front	of	the	Starbucks	by my	place	and	offered	the	ring	to	anyone	who	walked	past.	He	was	there	even when	it	rained,	wearing	a	black	wool	overcoat	and	cap	despite	the	fact	that	it	was summer	at	the	time.	He	never	spoke,	just	held	the	ring	out	in	his	hand.	It	was	a thick	golden	band	with	no	markings	on	it.	He	looked	as	if	he	hadn’t	talked	to anyone	in	years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once,	an	older	woman	started	yelling	at	him.	“How	dare	you,”	she	said	over	and over.	She	was	leaning	on	a	walker	herself.	The	man	just	stood	there,	holding	the ring	out	to	her.	Together	they	blocked	the	entrance	to	the	Starbucks.	A	crowd formed	around	them,	waiting	to	get	in.	“What	would	your	wife	think?”	the woman	shouted	at	him.	“What	do	you	suppose	she’s	thinking	right	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	bought	the	ring	from	him	a	few	days	later.	I	went	inside,	bought	a	latte,	then went	back	out	and	asked	him	how	much	he	wanted	for	the	ring.	He	still	didn’t speak,	just	shuffled	a	step	closer	to	me.	His	brows	went	up	and	down,	like	he was	signaling	something	to	me	in	code. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	a	ten	out	of	my	wallet.	“Is	this	enough?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	took	another	step	closer.	Now	I	could	smell	his	sweat.	His	mouth	worked	but still	nothing	came	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>I	pressed	the	ten	into	his	hand,	took	the	ring	out.	“All	right?”	I	asked.	He	kept shuffling	toward	me.	I	took	out	another	ten	and	put	it	in	his	hand,	along	with	the first.	His	hand	clenched	into	a	fist	around	the	money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	backed	away	from	him,	but	he	kept	coming.	All	the	way	down	the	sidewalk	he followed	me,	shuffling	at	the	same	pace,	staring	at	the	ring	I	held	in	my	hand.	I crossed	at	the	corner	just	as	the	light	changed,	but	still	he	came	on,	straight	into the	traffic.	That	was	the	last	I	saw	of	him,	standing	there	in	the	middle	of	the street,	amidst	all	those	cars,	hand	still	stretched	after	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">AFTER	I	STOPPED	GOING	to	the	park,	I	spent	a	few	days	at	the	art	gallery downtown.	The	first	morning,	I	stood	in	line	to	see	how	much	it	would	cost	to get	in.	The	woman	behind	the	counter	told	me	it	was	pay-what-you-can. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	if	I	can’t	pay	anything?”	I	asked.	“Do	I	get	in	for	free?”	I	still	had	some money	from	working	for	the	man	with	the	van,	but	I	didn’t	know	when	I’d	work again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	adjusted	her	glasses	before	answering.	“There	are	suggested	minimums,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	said.	“Most	people	pay	five	dollars.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	put	a	dollar	on	the	counter	and	she	stared	at	it.	“It’s	all	I	have,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right	then,”	she	said,	printing	me	a	ticket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	inside	of	the	gallery	was	cool	and	dark.	There	was	hardly	anybody	else	in the	place	at	this	time	of	day.	I	wandered	from	room	to	room	and	looked	at paintings	I	didn’t	understand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	about	an	hour	or	so	of	this,	I	found	myself	in	the	medieval	room.	The	walls were	covered	in	wood	carvings	of	people	in	churches,	and	there	was	a	large Christ	on	a	cross	on	one	wall.	I	sat	on	a	bench	in	front	of	the	Christ.	The	room was	completely	silent.	I	couldn’t	hear	anything	but	my	own	breathing.	It	was	like the	city	outside	of	the	gallery	didn’t	exist	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	lay	down	on	the	bench	and	stared	up	at	the	Christ.	It	was	made	of	some	sort	of painted	wood,	and	it	hung	slightly	off	the	wall,	like	it	was	about	to	fall	on	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	time,	the	overhead	lights	turned	off	and	I	was	in	the	dark,	except	for	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>small	spotlight	in	the	ceiling	that	lit	up	the	Christ’s	face.	It	kept	on	staring	at	me, until	I	closed	my	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	don’t	know	how	I	long	I	slept.	I	was	woken	by	a	woman	in	an	art	gallery uniform.	“There’s	no	sleeping	in	here,”	she	said.	“You	have	to	go	somewhere else	to	do	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wasn’t	sleeping,”	I	said.	I	sat	up	and	rubbed	my	eyes.	The	lights	were	back	on now.	“I	was	praying,”	I	told	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	backed	away	from	me,	putting	a	wooden	altar	covered	by	a	glass	case between	us.	“Don’t	make	me	call	security,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">RACHEL	TOLD	ME	she	had	to	go	to	work	the	night	I	was	supposed	to	meet Velma	at	the	mall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	it	was	your	night	off,”	I	said.	“I	thought	maybe	we’d	do	something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	got	called	in,”	she	said.	“We	need	the	money.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“True,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	someday	you’ll	get	a	job	too,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sure,”	I	said.	“Any	day	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">AFTER	SHE	LEFT,	I	drove	downtown	and	parked	in	the	mall’s	parking	lot.	I went	into	the	coffee	shop	across	the	street	from	the	south	entrance	and	bought	a coffee,	then	sat	in	a	window	seat.	I	watched	for	Velma.	Six	o’clock	came	and went.	Then	seven.	At	eight,	I	gave	up.	Velma	never	came. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	home	and	phoned	the	chat	line	until	I	reached	her.	“What	are	you	doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said.	“We	had	a	date.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can’t	keep	calling	here,”	she	said,	and	now	her	Russian	accent	was completely	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	mean?”	I	asked.	“The	whole	point	is	that	I	keep	calling.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	working,”	she	said.	“Do	you	understand	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a>“So	it’s	over?	Just	like	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	working.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">WHEN	I	WENT	BACK	to	the	art	gallery,	I	didn’t	go	anywhere	near	the medieval	section.	Instead,	I	went	to	the	modern	art	section.	There	was	another man	there,	sitting	on	a	bench	and	drinking	a	coffee	while	he	looked	at	a	life-sized	picture	of	Elvis	dressed	in	a	cowboy	outfit.	Behind	him,	on	the	floor,	was	a pile	of	empty	fast-food	containers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Someone’s	left	some	garbage	here,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	looked	over	his	shoulder.	“That’s	not	garbage,”	he	said.	“That’s	an exhibit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	mean?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	art,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	down	at	the	pile	of	containers.	There	were	even	little	bits	of	food	left	in some	of	them.	“Are	you	sure?”	I	asked.	And	there	were	other	little	bits	of garbage	mixed	in	with	the	containers:	crumpled	photographs,	movie	ticket	stubs, a	doll’s	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	paid	almost	ten	thousand	dollars	for	it,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	paid	ten	thousand	dollars	for	garbage?”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	paid	ten	thousand	dollars	for	art,”	he	said.	When	I	just	stared	at	him,	he added,	“It’s	an	installation	piece.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	never	had	that	much	money	in	my	life,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	has?”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	do	you	know	all	this	stuff?”	I	asked	him,	sitting	beside	him	on	the	bench. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	work	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shook	his	head.	“No,	I’m	more	of	a	collector.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	the	picture	of	Elvis.	Actually,	there	were	four	pictures	of	Elvis,	side</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a>by	side.	He	was	in	the	same	pose	in	each,	pointing	a	gun	at	me,	but	the	colours were	progressively	more	washed	out	as	the	panels	went	along,	until	he	was almost	invisible	in	the	last	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	think	this	one’s	worth?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	one’s	a	Warhol,”	the	man	said.	“It’s	priceless.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stared	at	it.	“I	don’t	understand,”	I	finally	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	moved	closer	on	the	bench.	“It’s	about	commodification	of	the	individual,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	said.	“See	how	Elvis	is	repeated	so	many	times,	until	he	becomes	nothing more	than	a	product?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like	those	soup	can	paintings,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly,”	the	man	said,	nodding	and	smiling	like	he	was	my	teacher. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head.	“I	could	do	this,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you	didn’t,”	the	other	man	said.	He	sipped	from	his	coffee	again	and	then looked	at	me.	“So	what	do	you	do?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	a	broker,”	I	told	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	studied	my	clothes	for	a	moment.	“You	don’t	look	like	a	broker,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	on	vacation,”	I	told	him.	I	looked	at	him.	“What	do	you	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	well,	this	is	where	things	get	awkward,”	he	said.	He	finished	the	coffee	and set	the	cup	down	on	the	floor,	then	stood	up.	“I’m	a	mugger,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stared	at	him	for	a	moment,	until	he	pulled	a	gun	out	of	his	jacket	pocket	and pointed	it	at	me,	much	like	the	Elvii	were	pointing	their	guns	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	this	some	sort	of	art	thing?”	I	asked	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	afraid	not,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	have	any	money,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a>“You’re	a	broker,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	just	making	that	up,”	I	told	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	don’t	you	make	this	easy	on	the	both	of	us,”	he	said,	“and	give	me	your wallet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	around	for	anyone	else	but	there	was	no	one	in	sight.	“Help!”	I	called. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	being	robbed!”	My	voice	echoed	through	the	empty	rooms,	and	then	the man	hit	me	across	the	head	with	the	gun.	Suddenly	I	didn’t	have	control	over	my body	any	more.	I	fell	to	the	floor	and	curled	up	in	the	fetal	position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sorry	about	all	this,”	the	man	said,	“but	I	have	a	wife	and	kids	to	feed.”	He took	my	wallet	from	my	pocket	and	walked	away	with	it,	disappearing	into	the gallery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	don’t	know	how	long	I	lay	there	before	I	could	move	again.	When	I	touched my	forehead,	my	fingers	came	away	with	blood.	I	heard	footsteps	and	sat	up.	An old	couple	with	cameras	around	their	necks	were	wandering	through	the	room, but	they	stopped	when	they	saw	me.	I	tried	to	call	to	them	for	help,	but	I	could only	croak.	I	waved	a	bloody	hand	at	them	instead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Must	be	one	of	those	performance	pieces,”	the	woman	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	grunted.	“Well,	I	don’t	like	it,”	he	said.	“I	don’t	like	it	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">WHEN	RACHEL	CAME	HOME	the	morning	after	I	was	supposed	to	meet Velma,	I	was	waiting	for	her.	I	was	wearing	my	suit,	the	one	I’d	bought	for	all the	job	interviews	I’d	never	had,	and	I	had	the	old	man’s	ring	in	my	pocket.	I’d lit	candles	and	put	them	all	over	the	living	room,	and	put	a	bible	on	top	of	the television. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	stopped	in	the	entrance	to	the	living	room	and	stared.	“What’s	all	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	the	ring	out	of	my	pocket	and	held	it	out	to	her.	She	didn’t	look	surprised to	see	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	that	what	you	really	want?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a>“That’s	what	I	really	want,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	rubbed	her	eyes	for	a	moment.	“All	right	then,”	she	said.	“All	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">ARE	YOU	SURE	YOU	DON’T	WANT	TO	KILL	HIM? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>By	Peter	Darbyshire</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	DROVE	OVER	TO	King’s	place	to	get	back	my	Tom	Waits	tickets,	the	ones he’d	stolen	out	of	my	wallet.	Mia	was	with	me,	using	the	rear-view	mirror	to	put on	her	makeup.	She	kept	having	to	redo	her	lipstick	because	she’d	quit	smoking two	or	three	days	earlier	and	now	her	hands	were	shaking	all	the	time,	like	she had	a	cold.	I’d	turned	up	the	heat	in	the	car	but	she’d	just	rolled	the	window down.	It	turned	out	she’d	never	been	King’s	girlfriend	at	all,	that	she’d	just	gone to	Kennedy’s	party	with	him.	We	were	sometimes	dating	now,	but	that’s	another story.	She’d	come	with	me	because	I’d	promised	to	give	her	one	of	the	tickets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">King	lived	across	the	city,	on	the	top	floor	of	a	warehouse	that	had	been converted	into	studio	apartments.	There	was	no	elevator,	so	we	had	to	take	the stairs.	Mia	ran	all	the	way	up,	even	though	she	was	wearing	a	skirt	and	high heels.	By	the	time	I	got	to	the	top,	she’d	already	gone	into	King’s	place,	but	I had	to	stop	and	catch	my	breath.	There	was	a	band	practising	in	one	of	the	other rooms	on	the	floor,	playing	the	first	few	bars	of	the	same	song	over	and	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	someone	began	whistling	into	a	microphone,	I	followed	Mia	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	room	was	mostly	empty,	just	a	couple	of	leather	chairs,	a	stained	pool	table with	one	cue	lying	across	it,	and	a	couch	that	looked	as	if	it	had	come	from Goodwill.	King’s	roommate,	Payne,	was	sitting	on	it,	wearing	nothing	but	a bathrobe	that	was	open	at	the	front.	He	was	staring	at	Mia,	who	was	pointing	a small	pistol	at	him.	For	some	reason,	he	had	an	erection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	doing?”	I	asked	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“King’s	not	here,”	she	said,	not	taking	her	eyes	off	Payne.	“He’s	already	left.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Payne	looked	at	me	and	licked	his	lips	but	didn’t	say	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	around	the	place.	There	was	another,	smaller	room	off	to	one	side	of	the main	room,	and	I	went	in	there.	The	walls	were	covered	in	peeling	red	velvet wallpaper,	and	there	was	a	bed	with	black	silk	sheets	in	one	corner.	A	framed poster	of	Audrey	Hepburn	hung	over	the	head	of	the	bed.	I	went	over	to	the	bed and	pulled	the	sheets	off,	looked	under	the	mattress.	There	was	nothing	but	some empty	condom	wrappers.	I	emptied	the	drawers	of	the	dresser	onto	the	floor, kicked	through	the	clothes.	Nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a>“He’s	not	here,”	I	said,	walking	back	into	the	other	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	already	told	you	that,”	Mia	said.	She	was	still	pointing	the	gun	at	Payne,	who still	had	the	erection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’s	King?”	I	asked	Payne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	at	me	with	an	almost	grateful	expression.	“He’s	gone	for	the	night.	He was	going	to	the	Rex,	to	hustle	some	guys	he	knew.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	he	take	the	tickets?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	tickets?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	concert	tickets.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	concert?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	THREE	OF	US	were	in	the	car,	Payne	in	the	passenger	seat.	I	didn’t	know where	the	Rex	was,	so	he	was	giving	me	directions.	Mia	sat	in	the	back	seat.	She put	the	gun	against	Payne’s	headrest	whenever	we	stopped	at	a	red	light,	like	he was	going	to	get	out	and	run	or	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	did	you	get	that	thing	anyway?”	I	asked	her.	It	was	shiny	and	small,	the size	of	her	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	bought	it	last	time	I	was	in	New	York.	Everything	is	so	cheap	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	don’t	wave	it	around	in	here,”	I	said.	“What	if	it	goes	off?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	won’t,	it	won’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	if	it	does.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Am	I	some	sort	of	hostage?”	Payne	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	no,	it’s	nothing	like	that,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	just	until	we	find	King,”	Mia	said	at	the	same	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Payne	just	looked	out	the	window.	It	was	growing	dark,	and	the	sky	had	turned	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a>violet	colour.	I	looked	at	my	watch.	It	was	nearly	eight	o’clock.	The	concert started	at	nine,	but	we	still	had	to	find	a	parking	spot	and	get	in	line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	if	he’s	not	there?”	Payne	asked.	“What	if	he’s	left	or	something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’d	better	be	there,”	Mia	warned	him.	“For	your	sake.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">WE	PARKED	ON	one	of	the	side	streets	by	the	Rex	and	walked	back.	The	place was	full	of	people,	every	table	taken	and	people	standing	all	the	way	to	the	pool tables	in	the	back.	The	bouncer	at	the	door	wanted	a	five-dollar	cover	from	each of	us	just	to	get	in.	“It’s	the	experimental	jazz	night,”	he	said,	like	that	explained it	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	just	looking	for	a	friend,”	Mia	said.	“We’ll	only	be	a	minute.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bouncer	shook	his	bald	head.	“It’s	five	dollars	a	night	or	five	dollars	a minute.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mia	looked	at	him	and	then	reached	into	her	purse.	I	didn’t	know	if	she	was going	for	money	or	the	gun,	so	I	stopped	her.	“I’ve	got	it,”	I	said	and	gave	the bouncer	ten	dollars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	him?”	he	asked,	nodding	at	Payne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mia	and	I	both	turned	to	look	at	Payne.	He	stood	on	the	sidewalk	behind	us, arms	folded	across	his	chest,	shivering.	He’d	only	had	time	to	throw	on	jeans and	a	T-shirt	before	Mia	had	forced	him	out	the	door,	and	now	there	was	a	cold breeze	coming	down	the	street.	“Well,	I	don’t	have	any	money,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	gave	the	bouncer	another	five	dollars,	and	he	finally	stepped	out	of	our	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	went	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	must	have	been	a	hundred,	a	hundred	and	fifty	people	in	there,	everyone crowded	shoulder	to	shoulder.	I	started	sweating	from	the	heat	almost	right away.	There	was	a	small	stage	to	one	side	of	the	door,	empty	except	for	a	few stools	and	a	drum	set.	I	got	up	on	it	and	looked	over	the	crowd	but	couldn’t	see King	anywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	probably	at	the	back,”	Payne	said.	“By	the	pool	tables.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a>I	looked	that	way.	I	could	see	the	tables,	but	there	was	too	much	smoke	in	the	air to	make	out	anyone’s	face.	“What’s	he	wearing?”	I	asked	Payne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	should	I	know?	I’m	his	roommate,	not	his	girlfriend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	got	down	from	the	stage	and	started	through	the	crowd.	Mia	pushed	Payne	after me.	She	was	shaking	hard	now,	and	she	looked	like	she	was	holding	her	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	someone	buy	me	a	drink?”	Payne	asked.	“I	think	I	at	least	deserve	a	drink for	all	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	tall,	skinny	man	with	dreadlocks	playing	pool	by	himself	at	the back.	At	his	feet	lay	some	sort	of	giant	grey	dog,	panting	and	watching	us approach.	There	was	a	line	of	drool	running	from	its	mouth	all	the	way	to	the floor.	I	stopped	on	the	other	side	of	the	table	from	the	man	and	watched	him	sink the	five	ball	with	a	bank	shot.	He	called	it	even	though	he	was	the	only	one playing.	He	waited	until	the	cue	ball	stopped	rolling	and	then	looked	up	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	looking	to	play?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually,	I’m	trying	to	find	someone,”	I	said,	but	now	he	was	looking	at	Mia, who	had	pushed	past	me.	“Oh,	look	at	the	puppy!”	she	said,	bending	down	to	pet the	dog. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	you	should	do	that,”	I	said,	but	she	was	already	running	her	hand down	the	long	length	of	its	back.	The	dog	tensed	and	stared	up	at	her	but	didn’t make	a	sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	you	looking	to	find?”	the	dreadlocked	man	asked.	He	was	staring	at	Mia’s legs,	which	were	exposed	all	the	way	to	her	upper	thighs	now	that	she	was	bent over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	doesn’t	look	like	he’s	here,”	Payne	said	to	me.	“So	I	think	I’m	going	to	leave now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	trying	to	find	a	guy	named	King,”	I	said,	ignoring	him.	“He’s	supposed	to be	playing	pool	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“King?”	The	man	swung	his	gaze	back	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>“How’d	you	like	to	come	home	with	me?”	Mia	asked	the	dog.	It	began	to	growl at	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	about	this	high,”	I	said,	holding	up	my	hand,	“and	he’s	got	a	scar	on	his left	cheek.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,”	Payne	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	on	the	right	cheek.	His	scar.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whatever.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	of	his	girlfriends	attacked	him	with	a	knife	one	night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whatever,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	I’ve	seen	him,”	the	dreadlocked	man	said.	He	bent	over	the	pool	table again	and	drove	the	eight	ball	into	one	of	the	pockets	without	calling	it.	“He	just finished	hustling	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	that	was	some	sort	of	cue,	the	dog	launched	itself	at	Mia’s	throat,	snarling and	barking.	She	fell	back,	screaming	and	kicking	at	it.	Somehow	the	dress	had ridden	all	the	way	up	to	her	hips.	She	was	wearing	black	silk	panties.	The	dog grabbed	on	to	one	of	her	feet,	and	she	started	kicking	it	in	the	face	with	her	other foot,	while	at	the	same	time	trying	to	get	her	purse	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	still	wondering	what	to	do	when	Payne	grabbed	one	of	the	pool	cues	from the	wall	and	started	beating	the	dog	across	the	back	with	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey	hey	hey,”	the	dreadlocked	man	said,	coming	around	the	table	with	his	own cue	as	the	dog	turned	to	go	after	Payne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	dragged	Mia	back	and	then	pulled	her	to	her	feet.	She	was	digging	around inside	her	purse	now,	but	I	grabbed	her	hand	before	she	could	find	the	gun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would	you	stop	that?”	I	said.	I	turned	around	to	help	Payne,	and	that’s	when	I saw	him.	King. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stepped	out	of	the	washroom	just	as	someone	started	playing	guitar	onstage. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a>It	wasn’t	any	song	I	recognized,	just	a	bunch	of	random	riffs	and	notes.	He	stood there	for	a	moment,	looking	around,	and	then	glanced	our	way	at	Payne’s	yells. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	face	was	lit	up	from	the	washroom’s	light,	and	I	could	see	his	skin glistening,	like	he’d	just	washed	it.	He	looked	straight	at	me.	Then	he	turned	and ran	for	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	after	him.	Through	the	music,	I	could	hear	the	sounds	of	Mia’s	heels	on the	floor,	following	me.	We	went	past	the	bouncer,	who	was	heading	for	the	pool tables	now,	and	out	into	the	night.	There	was	a	cab	waiting	outside,	like	a getaway	car,	and	King	threw	himself	into	the	back	of	it,	locked	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	hammered	on	the	window	and	the	cabbie	took	one	look	at	me,	then	put	the	car into	gear	and	sped	away,	tires	squealing.	King	looked	back	at	us	and	waved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	get	another	cab,”	Mia	said,	running	out	into	the	street	and	looking	around wildly.	“We’ll	chase	him,	like	in	the	movies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pulled	her	back	to	the	sidewalk	and	out	of	the	way	of	a	yellow	Corvette	with	its top	down.	The	two	men	inside	-	who	were	both	wearing	baseball	caps	-	stared	at her	as	they	drove	past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Relax,”	I	told	her.	“We	know	where	he’s	going.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Corvette	slowed	to	a	stop	in	the	street	and	the	passenger	shouted	something at	us	I	couldn’t	understand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	try	it,”	Mia	shouted	back.	She	pulled	out	the	gun	and	waved	it	at	them.	The driver	hit	the	gas,	and	they	disappeared	around	the	corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	starting	to	get	out	of	control,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	CONCERT	HALL	was	only	a	few	blocks	away.	We	were	almost	there when	Mia	started	laughing.	“Oh	my	God,”	she	said.	“We	forgot	Payne.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	true.	I	hadn’t	even	thought	about	him	since	I’d	seen	King.	“It	doesn’t matter,”	I	said.	“We	didn’t	need	him	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	we	left	him	with	that	dog,”	she	said.	“You	remember	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I	remember.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a>“And	that	Jamaican	guy.	What	if	he	was	some	sort	of	crazy	dealer	or something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	Jamaican	guy?”	I	asked,	confused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	guy	with	the	hair.	And	the	dog.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	wasn’t	Jamaican.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	wasn’t?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	He	just	had	dreadlocks,	that’s	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I	think	he	was	crazy	anyway.	Did	you	see	him	go	after	Payne	with	that pool	cue?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	doesn’t	matter,”	I	said.	“Any	roommate	of	King’s	deserves	what	he	gets.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	he	was	helping	us,”	she	said,	still	laughing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	checked	my	watch.	“There’s	no	way	they’ve	opened	the	doors	yet,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“King’s	going	to	have	to	wait	in	line.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mia	laid	a	hand	on	my	leg.	“And	you,”	she	said,	“you	saved	my	life	back	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	let	me	handle	this,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">WE	PARKED	IN	A	LOT	beside	the	concert	hall.	There	were	maybe	a	hundred people	lined	up	along	the	sidewalk.	A	man	with	a	top	hat	was	slowly	walking	up and	down	the	line,	playing	an	accordion	he	wore	slung	over	his	chest.	King	was nowhere	in	sight,	so	we	went	up	to	the	front	of	the	line.	The	doors	to	the	hall were	closed	and	barred	with	a	velvet	rope.	Two	women	wearing	white	shirts	and headsets	stood	in	front	of	the	rope,	talking	in	low	voices	and	blowing	cigarette smoke	away	from	each	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	haven’t	let	anyone	in	yet,	have	you?”	I	asked	the	women. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	either	of	them	could	answer,	the	first	person	in	line,	a	young	man	wearing a	black	suit	and	with	slicked-back	hair,	said,	“No	budging!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	are	you	talking	to?”	Mia	asked,	looking	at	him	and	frowning. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>“No	one’s	going	in	front	of	me,”	he	said,	pointing	at	us.	“I’ve	been	here	for hours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	looking	for	a	guy	with	a	scar,”	I	told	the	women.	“On	one	of	his	cheeks, I’m	not	sure	which	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	been	standing	here	for	hours?”	Mia	asked.	“In	that	suit?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	a	line,”	he	said,	flushing.	“I	was	here	first.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	haven’t	seen	anyone	with	a	scar,”	one	of	the	women	said.	“Have	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	no,	not	on	my	shift.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	you	go,”	the	first	one	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	I’ve	been	here	as	long	as	this	guy,”	the	other	one	told	me,	nodding	at	the guy	in	the	suit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	one’s	taking	my	seat,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t	it	assigned	seating?”	Mia	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	the	principle	of	the	thing!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	went	to	the	back	of	the	line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	if	he	doesn’t	show?”	Mia	wanted	to	know.	“What	do	we	do	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	he’ll	show,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	what	if	he	doesn’t?	How	do	we	get	in	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	I	said.	“We’ll	buy	some	tickets	from	someone	else	or something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	could	shoot	our	way	in,”	she	said.	“Like	Bonnie	and	Clyde.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wasn’t	listening	to	her	any	more,	though,	because	just	then	King	came	walking down	the	sidewalk,	a	Starbucks	coffee	in	his	hand.	He	stopped	at	the	front	of	the line	and	spoke	to	the	women	there.	I	could	hear	the	man	in	the	suit	say</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>something	about	the	line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	grabbed	Mia	by	the	hand	and	pulled	her	after	me.	“Whatever	you	do,”	I	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“don’t	kill	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,”	she	said	and	giggled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">King	was	walking	down	the	line	now,	looking	at	everyone	in	the	crowd	as	he passed.	“Tickets,”	he	said.	“Who	needs	them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	selling	our	tickets,”	I	said.	“He’s	not	even	going	to	the	concert.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	sure	you	don’t	want	to	kill	him?”	Mia	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	went	past	the	guy	playing	the	accordion.	He	winked	at	Mia	and	nodded	at me.	Then,	as	if	he	sensed	us,	King	looked	our	way.	When	he	saw	me,	he	stopped moving,	stopped	blinking	even.	We	were	still	ten	or	twelve	feet	away	from	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he	was	pushing	through	the	crowd	and	running	into	the	parking	lot, heading	for	the	street	on	the	far	side.	I	could	see	more	cabs	there,	so	I	knew	this was	our	last	chance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shoved	a	woman	reading	a	People	magazine	out	of	the	way	and	went	after	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	fifteen	or	twenty	feet	in	front	of	me,	winding	his	way	through	the	cars.	I jumped	up	on	the	hood	of	a	Lexus	and	ran	across	the	back	of	a	Mercedes	and	a Saab	to	jump	down	five	or	six	feet	behind	him.	He	looked	over	his	shoulder, threw	one	of	the	tickets	back	at	me.	I	stopped	to	grab	it,	and	when	I	looked	up again,	he	was	almost	at	the	other	side	of	the	parking	lot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	Mia	came	around	a	row	of	parked	cars	in	front	of	him,	the	gun	in	her	hand again.	She	was	barefoot	and	breathing	heavily,	but	grinning.	King	stopped	and put	his	hands	up.	She	took	several	steps	toward	him,	the	gun	pointed	at	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	shoot	him,”	I	yelled,	running	up	to	them.	I	was	careful	not	to	step	into	the line	of	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	going	to	shoot	him,”	Mia	said	to	me,	motioning	for	King	to	back	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	with	all	these	people	around.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,”	King	said	weakly.	“Come	on	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a>She	walked	him	behind	a	nearby	trash	bin,	where	no	one	could	see	us.	Overhead, on	the	wall	of	the	building,	was	a	large,	half-finished	mural	of	a	dog	holding	a giant	bone	in	its	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	okay,	okay,”	King	said,	holding	out	the	other	ticket.	“Let’s	not	get	rash here.”	His	face	had	gone	pale	except	for	the	scar,	which	was	a	red	line	against his	left	cheek.	Payne	had	been	wrong.	“It’s	all	a	big	misunderstanding	…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mia	hit	him	across	the	face	with	the	gun.	He	dropped	the	ticket	and	sagged	back against	the	wall,	the	bridge	of	his	nose	spilling	out	blood.	“Wait,”	he	said.	“Just wait	a	minute!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	Mia,”	I	said.	“What	are	you	doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	hit	him	again,	hard,	this	time	cutting	his	unscarred	cheek.	He	went	down, covering	his	head	with	his	arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right	then,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	insane?”	I	asked.	I	looked	around	the	corner	of	the	trash	bin.	A	couple of	people	were	looking	in	our	direction,	but	most	were	still	staring	ahead,	at	the doors	to	the	hall.	Beside	me,	Mia	bent	down	to	pick	up	the	fallen	ticket	and	then she	went	through	King’s	pockets.	She	found	a	pack	of	cigarettes	in	his	jacket	and lit	one.	“Thank	God,”	she	sighed,	leaning	back	against	the	wall	and	closing	her eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	back	at	King.	He	was	still	covering	his	head	with	his	arms,	but	he	kept glancing	around,	like	he	was	trying	to	find	a	way	out	of	this	situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	have	to	get	out	of	here,”	I	told	Mia.	“Before	things	really	get	out	of	hand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	opened	her	eyes	again,	then	stepped	over	to	me	and	took	my	head	in	her hands,	pulled	me	into	a	kiss.	Her	lips	were	wet	and	tasted	of	smoke.	And	she was	still	holding	the	gun	-	it	was	a	cold	line	against	the	side	of	my	head.	I	kissed her	back.	Out	of	the	corner	of	my	eye,	I	saw	King	trying	to	quietly	crawl	away, leaving	a	small	trail	of	blood	on	the	pavement	behind	him.	Then	I	heard	one	of the	women	from	the	concert	hall	yell	that	the	doors	were	now	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	all	I	wanted. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>He’ll	Live	Forever</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>By	Peter	Darbyshire</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	WENT	LOOKING	FOR	EDEN	and	the	hundred	dollars	he	owed	me.	I’d	heard he	was	shooting	a	movie	downtown.	The	sky	had	turned	from	white	to	purple before	I	finally	found	him,	in	a	little	church	with	yellow	police	tape	covering	the doors.	When	I	walked	in,	he	was	talking	to	a	young	woman	with	a	headset	and	a clipboard,	but	he	hurried	over	when	he	saw	me.	For	some	reason	he	was	dressed like	Robert	Duvall	in	Apocalypse	Now,	right	down	to	the	cavalry	hat	and sunglasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	you	were	dead,”	he	greeted	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	so,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	you	were	definitely	dead,”	he	said.	He	took	off	his	sunglasses	to	stare	at me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	dead	or	not,	here	I	am.	And	I’ve	been	looking	for	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	been	away,”	he	said.	“I	was	shooting	a	film	in	Antarctica.	It	was	so	cold my	piss	froze	before	it	hit	the	ground.”	He	shook	his	head	and	put	the	sunglasses back	on.	“It’s	the	edge	of	the	fucking	world	down	there,	man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’s	my	hundred	dollars?”	I	asked	him,	but	just	then	the	woman	with	the clipboard	came	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Time	to	work,”	she	said,	sliding	her	arm	around	his	waist.	She	couldn’t	have been	older	than	nineteen	or	twenty.	She	didn’t	look	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t	talk	now,”	Eden	told	me.	“I’m	in	the	middle	of	a	shoot.”	He	pointed	at the	name	tag	hanging	around	his	neck.	It	read	Second	Assistant	Director.	His whole	life	he	was	never	anything	but	Second	Assistant	Director.	“Thanks	for coming	by,	though,”	he	added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	I’ll	stick	around,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	and	I	sat	together	in	one	of	the	pews.	This	close	I	could	smell	the perfume	she	wore. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a>“You	a	friend	of	his?”	she	asked,	turning	pages	on	her	clipboard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	known	each	other	forever,”	I	said,	but	she’d	stopped	listening	to	me already.	Instead,	she	was	leaning	forward	and	whispering	something	into	her headset. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eden	talked	to	an	actor	leaning	against	the	altar	at	the	back	of	the	church,	then he	went	over	to	the	camera	crew.	A	bank	of	lights	had	been	set	up	outside, shining	through	one	of	the	stained	glass	windows,	and	it	turned	his	skin	golden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	yelled	“Action,”	the	actor,	who	looked	vaguely	like	someone	famous, took	a	half-dozen	steps	in	our	direction.	Then	a	fiery	mushroom	lifted	the	altar up	and	set	it	on	its	side.	Thunder	echoed	through	the	church,	and	I	watched	the flames	rise	up	against	the	ceiling,	where	they	boiled	away	a	painted	angel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	looked	back	down,	the	actor	was	on	fire	and	flailing	away	at	himself, and	Eden	was	grabbing	a	fire	extinguisher	from	the	camera	dolly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	that	really	someone	famous?”	I	asked	the	woman	beside	me,	“or	is	it	just	a double?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	wasn’t	supposed	to	happen,”	she	said,	frowning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	watched	Eden	and	the	cameraman	extinguish	the	actor,	who	was	screaming hysterically	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Was	that	a	real	altar?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	at	me	for	the	first	time.	“Do	you	really	need	to	be	here?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eden	came	over	to	us	and	said,	“That	wasn’t	what	I	wanted	at	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	nodded	and	made	a	note	on	her	clipboard.	“Should	we	do	another take?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does	Bob	look	like	he’s	ready	for	another	take?”	Eden	asked.	We	all	looked	at the	actor,	who	had	walked	over	to	us	with	the	help	of	the	cameraman.	He	looked to	be	badly	burned	only	on	his	arms	and	neck,	but	his	skin	all	over	had	the	same greasy	sheen	as	barbecued	hot	dogs.	Up	close,	he	didn’t	look	anything	like anybody	famous. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a>“My	name’s	Randall,”	he	said.	It	sounded	like	he	was	talking	through	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eden	frowned	at	him.	“No,	it’s	Bob.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	Randall,”	the	woman	with	the	clipboard	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eden	was	always	making	mistakes	like	that.	Years	later,	when	the	cancer	was finally	killing	him,	he	got	out	of	his	hospital	bed	and	started	tearing	down	all	the curtains.	“You’ve	set	up	for	the	wrong	scene,”	he	told	the	nurses	when	they	tried to	stop	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	doctor	told	Eden’s	mother	he	was	delusional.	“It’s	hallucinations	caused	by the	illness,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	that’s	so,”	she	answered,	“then	he’s	been	sick	all	his	life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Randall	started	coughing	from	all	the	smoke,	so	we	went	out	to	the	church	steps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five	or	six	crew	members	were	taking	a	coffee	break	there	but	they	left	when they	saw	Eden.	He	didn’t	notice	because	he	was	taking	Randall	from	the cameraman,	who	seemed	grateful	to	be	rid	of	him.	The	cameraman	went	off	after the	other	crew	members,	who	were	watching	us	from	the	other	side	of	the	police tape	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Was	it	at	least	a	good	take?”	Randall	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	yes,	it	was	very	good,”	the	woman	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	much	about	these	things,”	I	admitted	when	he	looked	at	me,	“but it	certainly	looked	good	from	where	I	was	sitting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	God,”	Randall	said	and	licked	his	lips.	His	tongue	was	a	brilliant	pink against	his	burned	lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I	guess	I’d	better	call	an	ambulance,”	the	woman	said.	She	reached	for	a cell	phone	on	her	belt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eden	put	his	hand	over	hers.	“Do	you	have	any	idea	what	that	would	do	to	our insurance	rates?”	he	asked.	“No,	he’s	not	hurt	that	bad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually,”	Randall	said,	“I	think	I’m	hurt	really	bad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>“I’ll	drive	him	to	the	hospital	myself,”	Eden	went	on.	He	offered	me	his	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	good	seeing	you	again,	but	I	have	to	get	back	to	work	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	my	hundred	dollars?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eden	looked	at	the	woman.	“What	is	this	hundred	dollars	he	keeps	going	on about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	told	me	you’d	give	me	a	hundred	dollars	when	you	had	your	heart	attack,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	that,”	Eden	said.	“It	wasn’t	a	heart	attack.	It	was	just	palpitations.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	may	be,”	I	said,	“but	I	still	drove	you	to	the	hospital.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	it	wasn’t	a	heart	attack,”	Eden	said,	frowning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wrecked	my	car,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	right,”	Eden	said.	“That’s	when	you	got	killed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	had	a	deal,”	I	said.	“I	want	my	hundred	dollars.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eden	looked	up	at	the	sky,	which	was	black	now,	and	pushed	his	hat	back.	There was	a	dark	rash	on	his	forehead.	“I	don’t	have	it	on	me,”	he	said.	“I’ll	have	to	go to	a	bank	machine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	I’ll	come	along.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	went	down	the	street	to	Eden’s	Acura	and	put	Randall	in	the	back	seat.	The parts	of	his	skin	that	were	burned	had	already	begun	to	blister,	and	he	smelled like	burned	rubber.	He	was	still	conscious,	though,	which	I	figured	was	a	good sign. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hang	in	there,	Randy,”	I	said,	tightening	the	seat	belt	around	him.	“You’ll	be	as good	as	new	in	no	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	don’t	touch	me,”	he	said.	“Ah,	Christ.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eden	drove	us	toward	the	hospital.	It	was	just	past	nine	o’clock,	but	the	day	was still	like	a	sauna,	the	air	burning	my	lungs	whenever	I	took	a	breath.	To	make</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a>matters	worse,	the	Acura’s	air	conditioning	was	broken.	Randall	hooked	his fingers	into	the	vent	beside	him.	“Can’t	you	make	this	thing	work?”	he	pleaded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	leaned	out	the	window	to	catch	the	breeze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	hit	a	long	line	of	cars	and	slowed	to	a	stop.	Eden	pounded	the	horn.	“I	hate the	summers	here,”	he	said.	“Every	year	I	think,	maybe	this	is	the	one	where	it gets	better.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	never	does,	though,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	he	agreed.	“But	maybe	someday.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	around	the	car	to	pass	the	time	and	found	some	empty	pill	bottles	by	my feet.	“What	are	these?”	I	asked,	examining	one.	They	were	all	unmarked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	for	my	condition,”	Eden	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	condition?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	nothing,”	Eden	said.	He	pounded	the	horn	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	it	anything	I	could	have?”	Randall	asked.	“I’m	really	hurting	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eden	searched	through	his	pockets	with	one	hand	and	came	up	with	another bottle.	He	passed	it	to	me,	and	I	took	out	one	of	the	yellow	capsules	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	they	do?”	Randall	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	make	you	feel	like	you’re	coming	apart,”	Eden	said.	“But	they	take	care of	the	pain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	reached	back	and	laid	the	capsule	on	Randall’s	tongue,	then	watched	him	as	he tried	to	swallow	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can	have	one,	too,	if	you	like,”	Eden	said	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	thanks,”	I	said.	“I’m	done	with	all	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	then	Randall	caught	sight	of	himself	in	the	rear-view	mirror.	“Is	that	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a>“I’m	afraid	so,”	I	told	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	Christ’s	sake,”	he	said,	raising	his	hands	to	the	burned	parts	of	his	face	and neck.	“Look	at	me!	I’m	ruined!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	that	bad,”	Eden	said.	He	pounded	the	horn	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Randall	looked	like	he	wanted	to	cry,	but	I	think	all	the	moisture	in	his	eyes	had dried	up.	“I’m	supposed	to	work	on	a	fucking	HBO	film	next	month.	How	am	I supposed	to	do	that	with	a	face	like	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“These	things	happen,”	Eden	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	look	like	a	mutant!	Like	the	Elephant	Man	or	something!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll	move	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	fucking	sue!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah	yeah	yeah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	while	the	traffic	started	rolling	again.	We	were	driving	past	the	police station	when	Eden	suddenly	jammed	both	feet	down	on	the	brake	pedal.	“Jesus Christ,	it’s	John	Cusack!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where?”	Randall	and	I	both	asked,	but	Eden	was	already	pulling	a	U-turn	onto the	other	side	of	the	street.	“The	blue	Beamer	two	cars	ahead,”	he	said,	ignoring the	horns	sounding	all	around	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	doing?”	I	said.	“We	have	to	get	my	hundred	dollars.	We	have	to get	Randall	here	to	the	hospital.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	right,”	Randall	sighed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get	the	script,”	Eden	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	script?”	I	looked	around	the	car	until	he	pointed	at	the	glove	compartment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	opened	it,	a	stack	of	water-stained	papers	fell	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	been	trying	to	get	it	to	John	for	years,”	he	said.	“I	wrote	it	with	him	in mind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>“What	is	it?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	an	action	adventure	crossed	with	a	black	comedy.	Like	Grosse	Point	Blank meeting	the	Coen	brothers	in	their	Barton	Fink	stage.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	glanced	at	the	first	few	pages.	Poor	Eden.	Even	back	then	it	was	clear	he	was never	going	to	be	anybody.	“I	don’t	know	about	this,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Eden	wasn’t	paying	attention	any	more.	He’d	managed	to	get	behind	the BMW	and	now	he	stuck	his	head	out	the	window.	“Johnnie!”	he	yelled.	“Hey, Johnnie,	it’s	me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ahead	of	us	the	BMW	driver	stepped	on	it.	Eden	put	both	feet	on	the	gas	pedal and	followed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	really	know	him?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	Eden	admitted,	“but	it	was	worth	a	try.”	He	reached	under	his	seat	and pulled	out	a	camcorder.	“Here,”	he	said,	handing	it	to	me.	“You	might	as	well film	this.	We	might	be	able	to	use	it	later.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	leaned	out	the	window	again,	enjoying	the	wind	now	that	we	were	driving	fast, and	focused	the	camera	on	the	car	ahead	of	us.	“Are	you	sure	it’s	him?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	it’s	John	all	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	chased	the	BMW	through	the	city,	recklessly	passing	cars	in	both	lanes	and running	red	lights.	It	was	like	we	were	in	a	movie	ourselves.	I	turned	the	camera on	Eden.	“So	tell	me,	Eden,”	I	said,	“why	do	you	want	him	to	have	this	script?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	that’s	a	bit	of	a	stupid	question,”	Eden	said.	“I	mean,	if	I	wrote	the	script with	him	in	mind,	then	doesn’t	it	stand	to	reason	I’d	want	him	to	see	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	if	he	doesn’t	take	it?”	I	asked,	but	he	wouldn’t	answer	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	we	were	in	Chinatown,	and	I	was	filming	the	passing	shops.	There	were lights	everywhere,	and	the	rushing	air	smelled	like	bread.	“Can	I	have	a	part	in your	film?”	I	asked.	“You	can	forget	about	the	hundred	bucks	if	you	give	me	a part	in	the	film.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a>But	Eden	didn’t	answer,	because	he	was	hitting	the	brakes.	“Oh	shit!”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Twenty	feet	in	front	of	us,	the	BMW	was	trapped	behind	a	line	of	cars	at	a	red light.	Cusack	got	out,	one	of	those	club	things	for	locking	steering	wheels	in	his hand.	Everything	was	in	slow	motion.	Eden	drove	around	the	side	of	the	BMW</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	stop	from	hitting	it,	and	Cusack	put	up	his	hand.	He	opened	his	mouth	wide just	before	we	drove	into	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shit!”	Eden	said	again	as	Cusack	disappeared	under	the	front	of	the	Acura,	one hand	briefly	clawing	at	the	hood.	We	came	to	a	stop.	“I	just	killed	John	Cusack,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eden	said.	Then	he	jumped	out	and	ran	around	to	the	front	of	the	car.	I	reached over	and	put	the	car	into	park	before	going	after	him.	Most	of	the	people	at	the stalls	beside	us	turned	to	watch,	and	I	made	sure	I	got	a	good	crowd	shot.	The smell	of	bread	was	gone	now,	replaced	by	that	of	rotten	vegetables. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	he	really	dead?”	I	asked,	stopping	beside	Eden	and	turning	the	camera	on	the fallen	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	isn’t	John	Cusack,”	Eden	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	zoomed	in	on	the	other	man.	It	was	true.	He	had	dark	hair,	but	other	than	that he	didn’t	look	anything	like	Cusack.	He	stared	up	at	us,	his	mouth	pushing	out little	pink	bubbles.	His	body	looked	broken	in	ways	I	hadn’t	been	able	to imagine	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	what	I	was	thinking,”	Eden	added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	told	you,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	isn’t	the	time	for	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	should	really	get	out	of	here,”	I	said.	But	it	was	already	too	late.	A	cop pulled	up	then,	parking	behind	the	Acura.	He	had	one	of	those	little	cameras mounted	on	his	dash,	and	I	filmed	it	filming	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cop	talked	into	his	radio	for	a	moment,	then	got	out	and	started	walking toward	us.	He	stopped	for	a	long	moment	to	look	at	Randall,	who’d	passed	out against	the	window.	“What	happened	to	this	guy?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	all	right,”	I	said,	“he’s	an	actor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>The	cop	stared	at	Randall	for	a	moment	longer,	then	came	over	to	stand	beside us.	All	three	of	us	looked	down	at	the	other	man.	An	escaped	crab	scuttled	past our	feet,	under	the	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which	one	of	you	was	driving?”	the	cop	asked.	He	scratched	the	back	of	his neck	and	belched	softly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was,”	Eden	sighed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cop	shook	his	head.	“You’d	be	the	one	in	a	world	of	trouble	then.”	He	took out	his	notepad	and	started	writing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shouldn’t	you	be	doing	something?”	I	asked	him,	pointing	at	the	man	on	the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Somebody	will	be	along	shortly,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eden	sat	on	the	ground	and	tore	off	his	cavalry	hat.	I	saw	his	whole	head	was covered	in	that	rash.	“Why	is	this	always	happening	to	me?”	he	asked,	starting	to cry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	could	I	do?	I	went	over	and	sat	beside	him,	put	my	arm	around	his shoulder.	Together	we	watched	the	other	man.	He	wasn’t	blinking	any	more,	and he	only	took	a	breath	every	now	and	then.	I	turned	off	the	camera	and	put	it	on the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	never	going	to	see	my	hundred	dollars	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later,	when	the	ambulance	had	arrived,	the	cop	made	Eden	get	into	the	back	seat of	his	cruiser. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	think	he’s	going	to	be	all	right?”	Eden	asked,	still	looking	at	the	fallen man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	yeah,”	the	cop	laughed,	just	before	he	shut	the	door.	“He’ll	live	forever.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a>HELL	BELIEVES	IN	YOU</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a>By	Peter	Darbyshire</p>
<p class="calibre1">LOOKING	BACK	ON	IT	NOW,	I	think	it	was	the	Mormons	who	robbed	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	two	of	them	had	been	wandering	around	the	neighbourhood	for	a	couple	of days	before	it	happened,	knocking	on	doors,	seeing	who	was	home	and	who wasn’t.	They	even	had	little	pads	of	paper	that	they	made	notes	on.	I	knew	they were	Mormons	because	they	wore	white	shirts	and	those	black	name	tags. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	morning	they	came	to	my	house.	They	were	both	wearing	sunglasses.	I couldn’t	see	anything	but	my	own	reflection	in	them.	“We’d	like	to	talk	to	you about	Hell,”	the	one	on	the	left	said	when	I	answered	the	door.	He	smiled	like there	wasn’t	anything	else	he’d	rather	be	talking	about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	really	believe	in	Hell,”	I	told	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	over	my	shoulder,	into	my	apartment.	I	could	smell	cigarette	smoke on	him	now.	“If	we	could	just	come	in	for	a	moment,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	just	on	my	way	to	work,”	I	told	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When’s	a	good	time	for	us	to	come	back?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	work	all	the	time,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	started	to	close	the	door,	but	the	other	Mormon	stopped	it	with	his	foot.	“It doesn’t	matter	whether	you	believe	in	Hell,”	he	said.	“Hell	believes	in	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	ACTUALLY	WAS	WORKING	during	this	time,	as	an	enumerator.	It	was	a temporary	sort	of	thing	I	found	through	the	paper.	My	job	was	to	knock	on people’s	doors	and	register	them	to	vote.	I	was	working	with	a	man	named Lincoln.	It	was	the	kind	of	job	one	person	could	do,	but	they	made	us	work	in pairs	anyway.	The	woman	who	hired	me	said	that	people	were	more	willing	to open	the	door	to	pairs	than	to	individuals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes	Lincoln	talked	about	the	neighbourhood	where	he	lived.	“It’s	all students,”	he	told	me	one	time.	“Every	time	I	walk	out	the	door,	I’m	reminded	of all	the	ways	my	life	has	gone	wrong	since	I	left	school.	But	the	rent	is	cheap.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	could	never	live	like	a	student	again,”	I	told	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>“I	don’t	live	like	a	student,”	he	said.	“I	live	in	the	same	neighbourhood	as students.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	the	difference?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	there	are	benefits,”	he	went	on.	“The	woman	who	lives	across	the	street doesn’t	have	any	blinds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	not?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	should	I	know?”	he	said.	“Maybe	she	can’t	afford	them,	or	maybe	she	just likes	people	looking	at	her.	Anyway,	the	point	is	that	I	can	watch	her	any	time	I want.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does	she	change	in	front	of	her	windows?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	it’s	nothing	like	that,”	he	said.	“I	just	watch	her	doing	her	regular	house stuff.	You	know,	cooking	dinner,	talking	on	the	phone,	that	kind	of	thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	you	don’t	watch	her	change?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	sometimes,”	he	admitted,	“but	that’s	not	really	what	I’m	interested	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	something	not	right	with	you,”	I	told	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">WE	MET	ALL	SORTS	working	that	job.	One	man	invited	us	in	for	beer.	He looked	like	the	kind	of	guy	who	played	hockey	every	week.	His	furniture	was	all black	leather.	We	sat	at	his	kitchen	table	and	did	the	paperwork	there.	Some	sort of	Christian	talk	show	was	coming	from	the	radio.	The	voices	were	low	and soothing.	The	table	was	already	covered	with	empty	beer	bottles	even	though	it was	only	noon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	asked	the	man	how	many	people	lived	there,	he	stared	out	the	window, into	his	backyard.	There	was	a	riding	lawn	mower	parked	in	the	middle	of	the yard.	Half	the	lawn	was	cut	and	the	rest	was	overgrown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	sure,”	he	finally	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	know	how	many	people	live	here?”	I	asked	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a>“It	used	to	be	me	and	my	wife,”	he	said,	“but	now	…	I	just	don’t	know	any more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	we	can	only	enter	definite	residents,”	I	told	him,	“so	I’ll	just	put	down one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	didn’t	say	anything	else,	didn’t	even	move	for	a	moment.	Then	he	put	his face	in	his	hands	and	started	to	cry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lincoln	and	I	got	up	and	went	back	outside.	The	man	followed	us,	still	crying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	haven’t	finished	your	beers,”	he	said	through	his	tears.	“You	have	to	stay and	finish	your	beers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	working,”	I	told	him	as	I	went	down	the	steps	of	his	porch.	“We	have jobs	to	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">ANOTHER	TIME	WE	walked	past	a	man	who	was	dying,	although	we	didn’t know	he	was	dying	at	the	time.	He	was	on	the	other	side	of	the	street,	leaning	on the	inside	of	the	white	wooden	fence	surrounding	his	yard.	He	waved	at	us	with a	handful	of	mail,	and	I	waved	back,	kept	on	walking.	It	was	only	when	we	went down	the	other	side	of	the	street,	maybe	fifteen	minutes	later,	that	I	saw	he	was dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	lying	face	down	in	the	grass,	the	letters	scattered	around	him.	The	wind had	blown	a	postcard	underneath	the	fence	and	onto	the	sidewalk	at	our	feet.	I could	see	ants	crawling	around	the	top	of	his	bald	head	already. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	guessing	a	heart	attack,”	Lincoln	said,	looking	down	at	him.	“What	do	you think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	we’d	better	do	something,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	know	CPR?”	Lincoln	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	been	meaning	to	take	one	of	those	courses,”	I	said,	“but	I	just	never	got around	to	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’d	better	not	do	anything	then,”	he	said.	“We	could	make	things	worse.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	not	breathing,”	I	said.	“How	worse	can	it	get?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>“I	meant	worse	for	us,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	we	can’t	just	stand	here,”	I	said.	“We’re	government	employees.	We	have to	do	something.”	I	went	to	walk	through	the	gate,	but	Lincoln	stopped	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	on	private	property,”	he	said.	“Think	of	the	lawsuits.”	He	took	out	his	cell phone	and	called	an	ambulance.	“We’ll	let	someone	else	worry	about	it,”	he	told me	when	he	was	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	reached	down	and	picked	up	the	postcard	while	we	waited	for	the	ambulance	to arrive.	The	front	was	a	picture	of	the	Eiffel	Tower.	On	the	back	someone	had written	in	red	ink:	“Hi	Mom	and	Dad!	Last	stop!	See	you	soon!	Love,	Kathy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	ambulance	arrived,	the	paramedics	didn’t	even	look	at	us.	They	knelt beside	the	man	at	the	same	time	the	door	of	the	house	opened	and	a	woman stepped	out.	She	was	wearing	a	housecoat	and	holding	a	cup	of	coffee	in	her hand.	She	looked	at	the	ambulance,	at	us	standing	there,	and	then	at	the	dead man	and	the	paramedics.	“Oh	my	God,”	she	said	and	dropped	the	coffee	cup.	It broke	at	her	feet,	and	the	coffee	sprayed	as	far	as	the	dead	man.	I	dropped	the postcard	back	to	the	ground.	I	don’t	think	she	noticed	me	reading	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’d	better	come	back	for	this	one	later,”	Lincoln	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IT	WAS	ONLY	AFTER	we’d	done	a	few	more	houses	that	I	remembered.	“Oh my	God,”	I	said.	“I	waved	at	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	talking	about?”	Lincoln	asked,	looking	around	the	street.	“Waved at	who?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	dead	man,”	I	said.	“He	was	trying	to	get	our	attention	and	all	I	did	was wave	at	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	were	you	supposed	to	know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Imagine	that,”	I	said.	“You’re	dying,	and	the	last	thing	you	see	is	me	waving	at you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	sure	not	what	I’d	want	to	see	in	that	situation,”	Lincoln	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	going	to	haunt	me	forever,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>“Well,	don’t	let	it	get	you	down,”	he	said.	“We’re	on	a	schedule	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">IT	WAS	AFTER	THIS	that	the	breakins	started.	I	came	home	one	day	after	work to	find	my	door	unlocked	and	a	half-eaten	sandwich	and	a	cigarette	butt	in	the sink.	Neither	had	been	there	when	I’d	left	that	morning.	And	I	didn’t	smoke anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	around	my	apartment	with	the	only	knife	I	owned,	a	small	steak	knife with	a	broken	tip.	I	looked	in	all	the	rooms	and	closets,	but	I	couldn’t	see	any other	signs	of	anyone	else	having	been	there.	And	nothing	had	been	taken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whoever	it	was	that	had	broken	in	had	made	themselves	a	sandwich,	smoked	the cigarette,	and	then	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	phoned	my	landlord.	He	was	a	lawyer	who	owned	buildings	all	over	the	city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	never	actually	seen	him,	as	he’d	sent	his	secretary	over	to	show	me	around the	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Were	you	in	my	apartment	today?”	I	asked	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	would	I	want	to	go	into	your	apartment?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	someone	was	in	here	today	while	I	was	gone,”	I	told	him.	“They	made	a sandwich	and	had	a	cigarette.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“People	shouldn’t	be	smoking	in	there,”	he	said.	“It	stains	the	walls.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	concerned	someone	might	have	an	extra	key,”	I	said.	“Or	maybe	the	lock	is easy	to	pick.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	guess	you’d	better	change	your	lock	then,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	kind	of	hoping	you’d	do	that,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	in	our	agreement,”	he	pointed	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	much	would	another	lock	cost	me?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	he	said.	“Fifty	or	sixty	bucks,	plus	labour.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	maybe	they	won’t	come	back,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>I	WENT	BACK	to	the	dead	man’s	house	after	work	one	day	and	rang	the doorbell.	The	same	woman	answered	the	door,	still	in	her	housecoat.	Her	eyes were	so	red	it	looked	as	if	all	the	blood	vessels	in	them	had	burst.	She	stared	at me	like	she	had	no	idea	who	I	was	until	I	said,	“I	was	here	when	your	husband died.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	at	me	a	moment	longer,	then	said,	“You	called	the	ambulance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I	was	with	the	man	who	called	the	ambulance,”	I	said,	but	she	was already	walking	back	into	the	house.	“I’ve	just	put	some	coffee	on,”	she	called over	her	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	followed	her	down	the	hall	to	her	kitchen.	The	walls	of	the	hall	were	lined	with framed	family	photographs.	I	tried	not	to	look	at	any	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	sat	me	down	at	a	wooden	table	in	the	kitchen	and	poured	me	a	cup of	coffee.	There	was	a	bowl	of	apples	in	the	middle	of	the	table,	with	unopened letters	piled	around	it.	I	saw	the	postcard	I’d	read	underneath	one	of	the envelopes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	sat	down	across	from	me,	picked	an	apple	out	of	the	bowl	and started	polishing	it	on	her	housecoat.	I	tried	the	coffee.	It	was	strong	and	bitter, but	I	didn’t	say	anything.	Fruit	flies	drifted	around	my	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,”	the	woman	finally	said.	“What	can	I	do	for	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wanted	to	apologize,”	I	said.	“About	your	husband’s	death	…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	very	kind	of	you,”	she	said.	She	put	the	apple	back	in	the	bowl	and	took out	another	one.	They	all	looked	polished	to	me	already. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	that’s	not	what	I	meant,”	I	said.	“I	meant,	I	wish	I	could	have	done	more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	had	a	bad	heart,”	she	said.	“There’s	nothing	anyone	could	have	done.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	waved	at	me,”	I	told	her.	“I	didn’t	know	what	he	wanted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	paused	in	polishing	the	apple	for	a	second,	then	resumed,	but	slower.	“What do	you	mean?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a>“I	just	waved	back,”	I	went	on.	“I	didn’t	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	trying	to	tell	me?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	I	said.	“Maybe	I	could	have	saved	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	put	the	apple	back	in	the	bowl	but	didn’t	take	another	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	I	would	have	known,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	want	from	me?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get	out,”	she	told	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	just	wanted	you	to	know	I	wish	I	could	have	done	more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	got	up	and	came	around	the	table.	I	thought	she	was	going	to	hit	me,	but instead	she	picked	up	my	coffee	cup	and	went	over	to	the	sink	with	it.	“Get	out,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	said	again	and	emptied	the	cup	into	the	sink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">AT	NIGHT	I	DREAMED	about	the	people	we’d	enumerated	that	day.	Only	now they	were	all	dead,	like	zombies.	They	opened	the	doors	to	their	houses	and shuffled	down	the	sidewalk	after	me,	worms	writhing	in	their	eye	sockets.	And when	they	met	each	other	in	the	street	they	fought,	tearing	into	each	other	with their	teeth	and	ripping	each	other’s	limbs	off.	The	streets	ran	with	blood.	It	was so	deep	I	had	to	wade	through	it.	And	the	more	they	killed	each	other,	the	deeper it	got,	until	it	was	flowing	into	their	houses	and	threatening	to	drown	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	the	same	thing	every	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	SECOND	TIME	my	place	was	broken	into,	they	made	sandwiches	again, but	this	time	they	also	took	all	my	CDs	and	videos.	I	went	around	the	apartment but	couldn’t	find	anything	else	missing.	I	called	the	police	this	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	single	cop	showed	up	an	hour	later.	He	wandered	around	the	apartment, making	notes	in	a	little	black	book	and	looking	at	all	the	photos	on	my	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aren’t	you	going	to	dust	for	fingerprints	or	anything	like	that?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a>“For	some	CDs	and	videos?”	he	asked	and	shook	his	head.	He	stopped	by	my bookshelf	and	studied	the	books	on	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	are	you	going	to	catch	these	guys	then?”	I	wanted	to	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	usually	don’t,”	he	admitted.	“Unless	you	have	an	idea	of	who	might	have done	it?”	He	looked	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	I	knew	that,”	I	said,	“do	you	think	I	would	have	called	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	you’ll	probably	want	to	change	your	locks,”	he	said.	“Sometimes	they come	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	me	something	I	don’t	know,”	I	told	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">ONE	OF	THE	HOUSES	in	the	neighbourhood	we	worked	was	home	to	a psychic.	It	was	an	old	Victorian	house	with	a	hand-painted	sign	in	the	window	-</p>
<p class="calibre1">Palms	Read,	Fortunes	Told.	Lincoln	stayed	on	the	porch,	smoking	a	cigarette, while	I	went	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	room	I	walked	into	looked	like	an	office.	There	was	a	white	leather	couch under	the	window	and	a	wooden	desk	and	chairs	on	the	other	side	of	the	room.	A crystal	ball	sat	on	one	corner	of	the	desk.	There	was	another	door	behind	the desk	but	it	was	closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	on	the	couch	and	waited,	but	no	one	came	into	the	room.	After	a	few minutes,	I	got	up	and	went	through	the	closed	door.	There	was	a	kitchen	on	the other	side.	Rows	of	dirty	glasses	sat	on	one	side	of	the	sink,	stacks	of	dirty	plates on	the	other.	Pizza	boxes	covered	the	table,	and	a	man’s	voice	came	from	the radio	on	the	counter.	“The	signs	are	all	there	in	the	Book	of	Revelations,”	he said.	“There’s	a	purging	fire	coming,	my	friends,	but	those	who	do	the	right thing	in	God’s	eyes	will	have	nothing	to	fear.”	The	air	smelled	of	mould	in	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	toilet	flushed	somewhere	nearby,	and	then	a	door	I	hadn’t	noticed	near	the kitchen	table	opened.	A	woman	with	grey	hair	and	jowls	came	out	of	the bathroom.	She	wore	the	kind	of	dress	that	only	old	European	women	wear.	She closed	the	door	behind	her	and	then	stopped,	looked	at	me	standing	in	her kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	need	to	ask	you	some	questions,”	I	told	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a>We	went	back	into	the	other	room	and	filled	out	the	enumeration	forms.	When we	finished,	Lincoln	was	smoking	another	cigarette.	I	kept	sitting	there,	and	the woman	asked,	“Is	there	anything	else?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	having	some	problems	at	home,”	I	said.	“I	was	hoping	you	could	help	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	reached	into	a	drawer	of	the	desk	and	pulled	out	a	deck	of	tarot	cards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Problems	with	your	love	life?	Financial	problems?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	want	to	find	out	who’s	breaking	into	my	apartment,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	put	the	cards	back	in	the	drawer.	“I	can’t	answer	that	with	these,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	that?”	I	asked,	pointing	at	the	crystal	ball.	“Can	you	see	who’s breaking	into	my	apartment	with	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This?”	She	picked	up	the	ball	and	shook	it.	The	inside	of	it	filled	with	snow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	just	a	prop,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	what	can	you	tell	me	then?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	read	fortunes,”	she	said.	“I	can	tell	you	what’s	going	to	happen	to	you	in	the future.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like	if	I’m	going	to	die?”	I	asked.	“That	kind	of	thing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	you’re	going	to	die,”	she	said.	“You	don’t	need	me	to	tell	you	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	THIRD	TIME	they	broke	into	my	apartment,	they	took	everything,	even the	furniture.	The	place	was	completely	empty,	not	even	blinds	for	the	windows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	like	I	had	never	lived	there	at	all.	I	couldn’t	even	call	the	police	because they’d	taken	my	phone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	pamphlet	from	the	Mormons	in	my	mailbox.	Sorry	We	Missed	You. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	words	were	superimposed	over	a	picture	of	a	burning	lake	with	hands sticking	up	through	the	flames. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	WENT	OVER	to	Lincoln’s	place	after	work	one	night	for	a	game	of	poker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	four	of	us	playing:	Lincoln,	myself,	a	man	named	Wylie,	and another,	older	man	named	Butler.	A	fifth	man,	Sinnet,	had	called	and	canceled. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a>“He’s	having	problems	with	his	wife,”	Lincoln	said	when	he	put	down	the phone.	“She	said	she	was	going	to	have	an	affair	if	he	went	out	tonight.”	He laughed,	like	the	idea	pleased	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	were	playing	at	Lincoln’s	kitchen	table.	It	was	low-stakes	poker,	quarter ante.	The	highest	pot	so	far	had	been	five	dollars,	which	I	had	won	on	a	straight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lincoln	had	to	tell	me	I’d	won,	because	I	still	didn’t	know	which	hands	were higher.	I’d	come	over	with	twenty	dollars	and	now	I	had	thirty,	but	most	of	it was	in	change.	Lincoln	had	a	big	jar	full	of	quarters	with	which	he	made	change for	the	bills.	It	looked	like	the	kind	of	jar	they	store	fetuses	and	dead	animals	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	telling	everyone	about	the	dead	man	we’d	seen.	“He	was	just	lying	there,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	“like	he	was	sleeping.	I	was	going	to	give	him	mouth-to-mouth	or something,	but	Lincoln	stopped	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	other	two	men	looked	at	Lincoln.	“The	guy	was	dead,”	he	said,	dealing	a fresh	hand.	“There	was	no	point	wasting	energy	on	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	if	he	was	already	dead,”	Wylie	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	still	wanted	to	try	and	save	him,	though,”	I	said.	“So	then	I	could	say	to people,	well,	at	least	I	didn’t	just	stand	around	and	do	nothing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	would	have	been	sued,”	Lincoln	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	would	someone	sue	me	for	that?”	I	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	wouldn’t	they?”	Wylie	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	I	was	having	a	heart	attack	once,”	Butler	said.	“It	was	just	some	sort of	weird	palpitations,	though.	But	my	wife,	she	didn’t	do	a	damned	thing.	Just sat	there	and	watched.	When	it	stopped,	I	said,	what	the	hell	are	you	doing? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Were	you	waiting	for	me	to	die?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Was	she?”	Wylie	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know.	She	told	me	she	was	paralyzed	with	fright.”	He	shook	his	head.	“I was	the	one	who	was	goddamned	well	paralyzed	with	fright.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which	wife	was	that?”	Wylie	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a>“Does	it	matter?”	Butler	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	in	or	out?”	Lincoln	asked	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	my	cards.	I	had	a	pair	of	tens,	an	ace,	and	a	pair	of	kings.	I	had	no idea	if	that	was	good	or	not.	There	was	ten	dollars	in	the	pot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	in,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	add	your	dollar.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	did,	and	so	did	Butler,	and	now	there	was	twelve	dollars	in	the	pot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	saw	a	cyclist	get	killed	once,”	Wylie	said.	“Had	his	head	down	and	rode straight	into	a	bus	that	was	turning.	Cracked	his	head	wide	open.	You	could	see his	brain.”	He	shook	his	head.	“I’m	not	afraid	of	dying,	but	I	am	afraid	of	dying stupidly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	did	his	brain	look	like?”	Lincoln	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	like	on	television.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	he	have	a	helmet	on?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does	it	sound	like	he	had	a	helmet	on?	Besides,	the	impact	broke	his	neck.	He would	have	been	one	of	those	-	what’s	the	term	for	it?”	He	looked	at	Butler. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	quad,”	Butler	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	at	least	he’d	be	alive,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	sooner	have	people	looking	into	the	inside	of	my	dead	head,”	Wylie	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“than	staring	at	my	drooling,	twitching	face.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	I’ll	call,”	Butler	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	all	laid	our	cards	on	the	table.	Butler	sighed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks	like	you	win	again,”	Wylie	said,	leaning	over	to	look	at	my	cards. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a>“Looks	like	you	need	another	beer,”	Butler	told	me	and	went	over	to	the	fridge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	never	got	the	beer,	though.	Instead,	he	stopped	by	the	kitchen	window	and said,	“Your	neighbour	is	on	fire.”	He	stayed	there,	looking	out	the	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	Lincoln	and	I	asked	at	the	same	time.	Wylie	was	in	the	middle	of lighting	a	cigarette	so	he	didn’t	say	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	place	across	the	street,”	Butler	said.	“It’s	on	fire.”	He	turned	the	kitchen sink	tap	on	and	let	the	water	run,	like	that	would	help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	rest	of	us	stood	up	and	went	over	to	the	window.	We	looked	through	our reflections	at	the	house	across	the	street.	All	the	lights	were	off,	but	there	were flames	shooting	through	the	blinds	in	one	of	the	second-floor	windows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	that	where	the	woman	you	watch	lives?”	I	asked	Lincoln.	He	didn’t	answer, though,	because	he	was	already	running	for	the	door.	The	rest	of	us	followed him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	mean,	the	woman	he	watches?”	Butler	asked	as	we	went	outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	hard	to	explain,”	I	told	him.	“And	I’m	not	really	sure	I	understand	it anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	could	smell	the	smoke	as	soon	as	I	was	outside,	but	I	couldn’t	hear	a	thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fires	always	made	a	lot	of	noise	in	the	movies,	but	this	one	was	so	quiet	I	could hear	someone	laughing	in	one	of	the	houses	next	door.	I	followed	Lincoln	across the	street	and	up	the	house’s	steps,	to	the	front	door.	He	had	his	cell	phone	out and	was	calling	911	now.	I	knocked	on	the	door,	then	tried	the	handle	when	there was	no	answer.	The	door	was	locked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	doing?”	Lincoln	asked,	putting	the	phone	back	into	his	pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	checking	to	see	if	anyone	was	home,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	anyone	was	home,”	he	said,	“I	think	they’d	be	putting	out	the	fire,	not coming	to	see	who	was	at	the	door.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	we	can’t	just	stand	around	doing	nothing	again,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	talking	about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a>“This	is	our	chance	to	do	something	right.”	I	kicked	the	door	just	underneath	the handle	a	couple	of	times,	and	there	was	a	loud	crack	as	the	frame	splintered.	I pushed	the	door	open	and	went	inside,	Lincoln	following	after	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	were	in	a	living	room	with	stairs	running	up	one	wall.	I	could	hear	the	fire now,	burning	somewhere	near	the	top	of	the	stairs,	and	the	air	was	hazy	with smoke.	Lincoln	turned	on	the	light,	and	I	paused	a	moment	to	look	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	framed	Warhol	Marilyn	Monroe	on	one	wall,	dozens	of	framed photographs	along	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello?”	I	called.	“Anyone	home?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	no	one	answered,	Lincoln	asked,	“Now	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Give	me	a	hand	with	this,”	I	said,	going	over	to	the	television.	I	was	coughing from	the	smoke	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	carried	the	television	outside	and	set	it	down	on	the	lawn.	Both	Butler	and Wylie	were	standing	on	the	sidewalk,	watching.	Neither	one	of	them	moved	in our	direction.	“Help	us	out	here,”	I	said,	but	they	just	shook	their	heads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	place	is	on	fire,”	Butler	said.	“I’m	not	going	in	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	safe,”	Wylie	added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	going	for	another	beer,”	Butler	said.	“Anyone	else	want	one?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	might	as	well	bring	them	all,”	Lincoln	said,	coming	out	with	the	telephone and	a	handful	of	CDs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thick	smoke	was	starting	to	flow	down	the	stairs	by	the	time	Lincoln	and	I carried	the	couch	out,	and	we	could	hear	sirens	in	the	distance.	Most	of	the woman’s	living	room	was	scattered	around	the	front	yard	by	this	point.	Wylie and	Butler	were	sitting	on	the	coffee	table,	drinking	the	beer	they’d	brought	from Lincoln’s	place.	There	was	still	no	one	else	on	the	street,	but	I	could	see	faces looking	out	at	us	from	the	neighbouring	houses	now	that	the	flames	were	coming out	of	all	the	upstairs	windows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	it,”	Lincoln	said,	dropping	his	end	of	the	couch	and	sitting	on	it.	He couldn’t	stop	coughing,	and	his	skin	was	black	with	ash	and	sweat.	“I	think	I’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a>reached	my	limit	here,”	he	gasped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	started	moving	the	furniture	around	the	lawn,	dragging	the	couch	and	chairs into	the	same	arrangement	they’d	had	inside	the	house.	That	was	when	the	fire truck	arrived.	Two	firemen	wearing	oxygen	masks	and	carrying	axes	walked over	and	watched	me	for	a	moment.	“What	the	hell	are	you	doing?”	one	of	them asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	just	trying	to	help,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get	the	hell	out	of	here!”	he	shouted,	waving	his	axe	at	me.	I	went	over	to	stand beside	Butler	and	Wylie,	who	had	moved	from	the	coffee	table	to	the	sidewalk when	the	fire	truck	pulled	up.	Lincoln	stood	up	from	the	couch	and	then	bent over,	started	vomiting	on	his	feet.	Wylie	handed	me	a	beer.	“They’re	a	little warm,”	he	said.	“On	account	of	the	fire.”	I	drank	half	of	it	down	in	one	swallow, then	the	three	of	us	watched	the	firemen	drag	hoses	into	the	burning	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	the	time	we’d	finished	the	beer,	the	fire	was	out.	The	firemen	came	out	of	the house	and	sat	on	the	bumpers	of	their	truck	while	a	cop	sealed	off	the	entrance	of the	house	with	yellow	tape.	I	went	over	and	sat	beside	Lincoln	on	the	couch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	I’m	going	to	make	it	into	work	tomorrow,”	he	said.	His	chin	and the	front	of	his	shirt	were	streaked	with	a	mixture	of	vomit	and	soot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	that’s	all	right,”	I	said.	I	put	my	feet	up	on	the	coffee	table	and	looked around	the	yard.	“We	certainly	did	a	good	job	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	did,”	Lincoln	agreed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Redemptive,	even.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	what	that	word	means.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	won’t	even	be	able	to	tell	the	difference	when	she	comes	home,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	so	sure	about	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	for	hours	on	the	couch	after	the	others	went	back	inside	to	finish	the	poker game.	I	was	waiting	for	her	to	come	home,	so	I	could	tell	her	that	I	was	the	one who’d	brought	everything	outside	and	saved	it	from	the	fire.	I	kept	on	waiting</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a>even	after	Butler	and	Wylie	drove	away	with	a	wave	at	me,	and	after	Lincoln’s lights	went	out.	But	she	didn’t	come	home	that	night.	She	never	found	out	what	I did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">HOW	LONG	DOES	THIS	SORT	OF	THING	USUALLY	TAKE? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a>By	Peter	Darbyshire</p>
<p class="calibre1">AND	THIS	IS	THE	STORY	of	the	last	time	I	ever	saw	Rachel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	to	take	her	to	the	clinic.	I	was	watching	television	in	the	living	room	while I	waited	for	her	to	get	dressed.	There	was	a	documentary	on,	something	about	a village	in	Mongolia	where	all	the	women	wore	white	Tshirts	with	Tide	logos	on them.	Boxes	of	Tide	were	everywhere,	in	the	baskets	they	carried,	in	front	of stores,	in	the	doorways	of	huts.	The	narrator	said	they	even	brushed	their	teeth with	the	stuff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Think	of	what	that	would	do	to	your	insides	if	you	swallowed	it,”	I	yelled	to Rachel	in	the	other	room.	When	she	didn’t	answer,	I	added,	“Why	Tide?	Why not	Arm	and	Hammer?	Or	ABC?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	they	worship	Tide,”	she	said,	coming	out	of	the	bedroom.	“Maybe	it’s like	some	sort	of	god	to	them.”	She	was	dressed	in	sweat	pants	and	a	T-shirt,	like she	was	just	going	out	for	a	jog. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	so,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	kind	of	thing	happens	all	the	time,”	she	went	on.	“Remember	that	tribe	in Africa	or	New	Zealand	or	wherever	it	was	that	worshipped	Coke	bottles?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	that	was	a	movie,”	I	said,	“not	real	life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	no,”	she	said,	“it’s	all	real-life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">OUTSIDE,	IT	HAD	RAINED	all	night,	and	now	the	air	was	cold	and	wet,	like the	inside	of	a	forest.	There	were	earthworms	everywhere,	curling	themselves into	little	knots	or	trying	to	dig	their	way	into	the	sidewalk.	I	stepped	over	them carefully,	but	Rachel	put	her	feet	down	without	looking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	once	lived	with	a	Jamaican	guy	who	wouldn’t	go	out	in	rainstorms	because	of the	worms.	“How	can	you	stand	it?”	he’d	asked	me	one	time.	“All	those	maggots coming	out	of	the	ground	like	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Worms,”	I’d	corrected	him.	“They’re	worms,	not	maggots.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a>“What’s	the	difference?”	he’d	asked.	“I	get	sick	just	thinking	about	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	been	living	with	me	because	his	wife	had	kicked	him	out.	He	later	wound up	in	jail	for	hitting	her,	although	I	should	point	out	that	she	had	driven	their	car into	him	first.	He	told	the	judge	at	the	trial	that	he	just	wanted	a	happy	marriage, like	on	television.	He	got	six	months. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	found	my	car	around	the	corner	and	drove	along	the	wet	streets, accompanied	only	by	the	sounds	of	the	engine	and	the	squeal	of	the	brakes whenever	we	took	a	corner.	I	tried	the	radio	after	a	few	minutes,	but	it	was	still broken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	long	does	this	sort	of	thing	usually	take?”	I	asked	after	a	while. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	looked	out	the	side	window	and	didn’t	answer	me	right	away,	and	for	a moment	I	thought	maybe	she	was	crying.	I	looked	closely	at	her,	afraid	I’d	see tears	on	her	cheeks,	but	there	was	nothing	on	her	face	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	she	finally	said.	“I	don’t	do	this	all	that	often.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	LAST	TIME	I’d	been	in	a	clinic	had	been	months	before	I’d	met	Rachel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	gone	because	I’d	woken	up	that	morning	with	an	itching	I	was	convinced was	gonorrhea	or	syphilis	or	something	like	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	doctor	was	less	convinced,	though.	He	didn’t	bother	to	sit	down	when	he came	into	the	examination	room,	just	leaned	against	the	desk	and	stared	over	my head,	at	a	poster	of	internal	organs	taped	to	the	wall.	He	didn’t	look	me	in	the eye	the	whole	time	I	was	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	been	having	sex	recently?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I’ve	given	up	on	all	that,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	coffee	or	alcohol?	You	been	drinking	a	lot	lately?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	guess.	No	more	than	usual,	though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	probably	just	an	infection	then,	but	we’ll	do	some	blood	tests	anyway,”	he said.	He	had	me	lower	my	pants	and	lie	down	on	the	examination	table.	I thought	very	hard	about	not	getting	an	erection	as	he	touched	me,	but	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a>already	too	late. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	at	least	everything’s	working	fine,”	he	commented. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	doesn’t	usually	happen,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	all	right.	Lets	me	see	things	easier.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	about	killing	him	then,	about	knocking	him	to	the	floor	and	searching through	his	drawers	until	I	found	a	hypodermic	or	scalpel	I	could	stab	him	with. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or	maybe	I	could	strangle	him	with	the	cord	of	that	thing	they	use	to	look	in your	ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thinking	about	all	that	just	made	me	harder,	though,	and	I	swore	then	that	I	was never	going	to	set	foot	in	such	a	place	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">RACHEL	AND	I	FOUND	a	walk-in	clinic	by	the	twenty-four-hour	A&amp;P.	Inside the	clinic,	the	walls	were	covered	in	half-finished	murals	of	Winnie	the	Pooh	and Tigger.	No	signs	of	the	others,	though,	no	Piglet	or	Christopher	Robin.	On	the television	in	the	corner,	Oprah	was	talking	to	the	empty	waiting	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	nurse	at	the	reception	desk	was	reading	a	Cosmopolitan	magazine	and	didn’t look	away	from	it	when	we	walked	up.	“Reason	for	visit?”	she	asked,	circling the	answers	to	a	quiz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	need	a	morning-after	pill,”	Rachel	told	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	the	nurse	looked	at	me,	and	I	felt	I	had	to	say	something.	“The	condom broke,”	I	explained.	“But	I	didn’t	notice	until	afterwards.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	should	always	buy	the	extra-strong	ones,”	the	nurse	said.	“Just	in	case.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	gave	Rachel	some	paperwork	to	fill	out	and	then	went	back	to	her	quiz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	sat	in	the	waiting	room	and	watched	Oprah.	It	was	a	rerun	about	parents reuniting	with	the	children	they’d	given	up	for	adoption.	Everybody	was	crying, but	I	couldn’t	concentrate.	I	didn’t	understand	why	we	had	to	wait	when	we	were the	only	people	in	the	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Christ,”	Rachel	said,	shaking	her	head	at	the	television.	“Isn’t	there	anything else	on?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a>I	looked	around	for	the	remote	but	didn’t	see	it	anywhere.	I	went	up	to	the counter	and	asked	the	nurse	if	she	had	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	lost	it,”	she	told	me,	not	looking	up	from	the	magazine	again.	“We	think maybe	one	of	the	patients	stole	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	don’t	you	just	get	a	new	one?”	I	asked	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	was	the	new	one,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	over	to	the	television	to	try	and	turn	the	channel,	but	it	was	too	high	on the	wall	for	me.	I	even	tried	jumping,	which	made	Rachel	laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t	watch	any	more	of	this,”	she	said.	“I’m	going	outside	for	some	air.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	she	didn’t	come	back,	I	began	to	wonder	if	she’d	left,	so	I	followed	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	lying	on	the	trunk	of	my	car,	smoking	a	cigarette.	It	was	starting	to	rain again,	but	she	didn’t	seem	to	care.	She	just	kept	lying	there,	staring	up	at	the	sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	wrong	with	you?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shook	her	head.	“Nothing,”	she	said.	“There’s	nothing	wrong	with	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">LATER,	IN	THE	EXAMINATION	ROOM	down	the	hall,	I	found	a	stack	of brochures	about	pregnancy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	says	here	that	all	the	cells	are	identical	in	the	first	two	weeks,”	I	told	Rachel, showing	her	the	pictures.	“It’s	only	later	that	they	start	changing	into	different parts	of	the	body.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	really	don’t	want	to	hear	this	right	now,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	they	start	growing	right	away.	It	could	be	growing	inside	you	right	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	never	having	sex	with	you	again,”	she	told	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	then	the	doctor	came	in.	She	looked	like	somebody’s	mother,	with	her	gray hair	and	floral	blouse.	She	sat	down	at	the	desk	and	took	a	package	of	pills	from her	pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll	need	to	take	two	right	away,”	she	told	Rachel,	“and	you	can’t	eat</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>anything	for	twenty-four	hours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,	right,”	Rachel	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	sure	about	this?”	I	asked	her,	and	now	the	doctor	looked	at	me	for	the first	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure	about	what?”	Rachel	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	we	should	just	wait	and	see	what	happens,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Out	of	all	our	choices,”	she	said,	“I	think	that’s	about	last	on	the	list.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will	it	at	least	kill	the	baby	fast	then?”	I	asked	the	doctor.	“Before	it	starts growing	a	brain	or	anything?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	we’re	about	done	here,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	dry-swallowed	two	of	the	pills.	She	closed	her	eyes	for	a	moment,	then opened	them	and	smiled	at	me.	“I	can	feel	them	working	already,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	WAITED	IN	THE	CAR	while	Rachel	finished	talking	to	the	doctor.	I	was spending	the	whole	night	waiting.	After	a	while,	I	started	thumping	the	steering wheel	with	my	fists.	I	couldn’t	stop	until	Rachel	finally	came	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stood	in	the	doorway	for	a	moment	and	lit	another	cigarette	before	coming over	to	the	car.	She	opened	the	door	but	didn’t	get	in,	just	stood	there,	smoking and	looking	around	the	empty	lot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everything	okay?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everything’s	fine	now,”	she	said.	She	laughed.	“That	was	a	close	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	there	a	moment	longer	and	then	said,	“What	do	we	do	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	need	groceries,”	she	said,	looking	at	the	A&amp;P. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right.”	I	started	to	get	out	of	the	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	like	to	do	it	on	my	own,”	she	said.	She	flicked	the	cigarette	away	without extinguishing	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a>“I’ll	wait	here,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">ONCE	RACHEL	WAS	INSIDE	THE	A&amp;P,	I	started	the	car	and	drove	a	few streets	over,	to	an	all-night	gas	station	I	knew	about.	The	attendant,	a	young	man named	Phil,	topped	up	the	gas	tank	and	then	leaned	into	my	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	sure	picked	the	right	night,”	he	said,	rubbing	his	nose	with	an	oil-stained finger.	“A	friend	of	mine	who	works	at	the	hospital	just	dropped	off	some	meds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	they	do?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	really	sure,”	he	admitted.	“But	he	told	me	they	use	them	to	calm	down the	crazies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	sounds	just	fine,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	slapped	the	car’s	roof	and	went	back	inside.	I	sat	there	and	watched	the traffic	pass.	A	cop	cruised	past	once	but	he	never	looked	my	way.	Still,	I	was sweating	by	the	time	Phil	finally	came	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	counted	my	money	twice	and	then	handed	over	a	baggie	holding	a	half-dozen yellow-and-black	capsules.	I	dry-swallowed	one	right	away	and	threw	the	rest	in the	glove	compartment.	The	one	I’d	swallowed	scratched	my	throat	all	the	way down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	want	anything	else?”	Phil	asked.	“Oil	checked	or	anything	like	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	that’s	all	I	need.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	got	windshield	washer	fluid	on	sale.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	STARTED	TO	GET	HUNGRY	on	the	way	back	to	the	A&amp;P.	I	took	a	few	more of	the	pills,	but	they	didn’t	help.	I	drove	around	the	area	for	a	while,	looking	for a	coffee	shop	that	was	still	open,	but	there	was	nothing,	just	lit-up,	empty	office buildings.	I	couldn’t	even	find	a	7-Eleven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stopped	at	a	red	light,	and	that’s	when	the	drugs	hit	me.	I	felt	like	I	was	slowly collapsing	inward.	When	the	light	turned	green	again,	I	couldn’t	bring	myself	to touch	the	gas	pedal.	I	couldn’t	even	take	my	foot	off	the	brake.	I	just	sat	there, staring	at	the	light	as	it	changed	colours	what	seemed	once	every	hour	or	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a>After	a	while,	I	noticed	more	lights	flashing	on	and	off	behind	me,	but	I	didn’t see	the	cop	until	he	rapped	on	my	door	with	his	flashlight.	Then	I	saw	the	cruiser in	the	rear-view.	I	somehow	managed	to	roll	down	the	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	doing?”	the	cop	asked	me.	He	was	an	older	man,	tall	and	heavy and	with	a	white	mustache.	The	hand	not	holding	the	flashlight	was	on	his	gun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stared	at	him.	“What	do	you	mean?”	I	finally	managed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	think	I	mean?”	he	asked	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	that	over	for	a	moment	and	then	said,	“I	was	just	on	my	way	to	pick	up my	wife.	She’s	doing	a	little	shopping.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	know	your	lights	are	off?”	he	asked	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	didn’t,”	I	said.	I	looked	around	the	deserted	street.	I	couldn’t	see	what difference	it	made	whether	my	lights	were	on	or	not.	There	were	streetlights everywhere,	after	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	also	know	that	you	haven’t	moved	in	the	last	five	minutes?”	he	went on.	His	voice	was	quiet	and	conversational. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	like	to,”	I	said,	“but	I	really	can’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	mean,	you	can’t?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know.	I	just	can’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	at	me	for	a	moment	longer,	then	said,	“Wait	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,”	I	said.	Where	did	he	think	I	would	go? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	walked	back	to	his	car	and	spoke	into	his	radio	for	a	while.	When	he	came back,	he	opened	my	door	and	reached	in	to	turn	off	the	ignition.	“Seeing	as	you can’t	drive,”	he	said	in	that	same	tone	of	voice,	“I’m	going	to	do	it	for	you.”	I	let him	walk	me	back	to	his	cruiser.	Once	he	had	me	on	my	feet	and	was	guiding me,	I	could	move	just	fine.	But	what	I	really	wanted	to	do	was	sit	down	and	not move	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a>We	waited	for	a	tow	truck	to	come	for	my	car,	and	then	he	took	me	to	a	hospital I’d	never	been	to	before.	I	couldn’t	take	my	eyes	off	the	doctor	who	examined me.	He	was	young	and	clean-shaven,	with	hair	that	shone	under	the	fluorescent lights.	Behind	him,	the	walls	burned	with	more	light,	like	it	was	seeping	through from	the	other	side.	I	understood	then	what	the	cop	had	meant	about	my	lights being	out.	He’d	brought	me	here	so	I	could	shine	like	this	young	doctor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	found	these	in	the	car,”	the	cop	told	the	doctor,	showing	him	the	bag	of	pills.	I hadn’t	seen	him	take	them,	hadn’t	even	noticed	him	searching	the	car,	but	that was	okay.	I	didn’t	want	any	more	of	those	pills. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	many	of	these	did	you	take?”	the	doctor	asked	me,	holding	up	the	bag	and frowning	at	its	contents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	I	said.	“Three	or	four.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jesus,”	the	doctor	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	he	going	to	be	all	right?”	the	cop	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Probably.	Physically,	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	put	me	into	a	room	with	an	old	woman	in	the	bed	opposite	mine.	There were	tubes	sticking	out	of	her	nose	and	arms,	and	she	only	breathed	every	few seconds	or	so.	There	seemed	to	be	a	longer	gap	between	each	breath.	It	occurred to	me	that	she	was	probably	dying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	out	the	window.	Somehow	the	sky	had	already	lightened	into	grey.	I couldn’t	see	the	street	outside,	but	I	could	hear	the	cars	driving	by.	All	those people,	going	on	with	their	lives,	and	there	I	was,	lying	in	a	room	with	a	dying woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	don’t	know	how	long	I	lay	there	before	the	nurse	came	in.	She	looked	at	the	old woman	and	shook	her	head,	then	came	over	to	me.	“And	how	are	you	doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	have	you	done	with	my	car?”	I	asked	her.	It	sounded	like	somebody	else’s voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	you	worry	about	that,”	she	said.	She	put	her	hand	on	my	forehead.	“We’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a>have	you	out	of	here	in	no	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	want	my	car,”	I	said.	I	tried	to	sit	up	but	she	held	me	down.	She	was	stronger than	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	just	have	to	make	sure	you’re	back	to	normal,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	want	my	car!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p163"></a>STILL</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p164"></a>By	Peter	Darbyshire</p>
<p class="calibre1">“CNN,”	THE	VOICE	on	the	phone	said.	“Quick.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	is	this?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	your	mother.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">CNN	was	broadcasting	a	live	car	chase.	Helicopter	shot	from	above.	A	cluster	of black-and-white	cruisers	slowly	following	a	blue	pickup	through	freeway	traffic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sound	was	off	on	my	set,	but	I	could	hear	the	commentator’s	distant	voice coming	from	my	parents’	television.	There	was	a	bit	of	an	echo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello?”	my	mother	asked.	“Still	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	else	would	I	be?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	California,”	my	father	said	on	another	extension.	“We	were	there	just	last year.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	hijacked	the	truck,”	my	mother	said,	“and	went	on	a	rampage.	He	was shooting	at	people	and	running	stop	signs	and	everything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	see	any	of	that,”	my	father	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	happened	earlier,”	she	said.	“The	announcer	told	me	while	you	were	in	the bathroom.”	She	cleared	her	throat.	“Anyway,	I	figure	he’s	one	of	those	typical California	types.	You	know	the	kind	I	mean.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	vegetarian?”	I	asked.	“An	actor?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	druggie,”	she	said,	lowering	her	voice.	“And	after	he	hijacked	the	truck	-” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait,”	I	said.	“Did	he	hijack	the	truck	or	steal	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	the	difference?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	there	someone	in	it	with	him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	He	forced	them	out	at	gunpoint.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p165"></a>“That’s	theft	then,”	I	said.	“Not	hijacking.	Hijacking	would	be	if	he’d	taken	them along,	if	he	had	hostages.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	pretty	sure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	had	no	idea,”	my	mother	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	was	I	for	all	this?”	my	father	muttered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	pickup	tried	to	pass	on	the	shoulder	and	hit	the	guardrail,	bouncing	off	and into	a	white	van.	Both	vehicles	stopped	for	a	moment,	and	the	police	cruisers slowed.	Then	the	pickup	rolled	forward	again.	It	drove	past	one	off-ramp	after another,	hesitating	slightly	at	each	one,	as	if	looking	for	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	I	want	to	know,”	my	mother	said,	“is	where	he’s	going.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	long	pause,	then	she	added,	“So,	how	are	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	you	know,”	I	said.	“The	same.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,	good,”	she	said.	“We’re	fine,	too.”	There	were	another	few	seconds	of dead	air,	during	which	the	truck	finally	took	an	off-ramp	into	a	run-down neighbourhood,	and	then	she	asked,	“How’s	work?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,”	I	said,	even	though	it	had	been	weeks	since	I	worked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	good,”	she	said.	“Because	these	days	…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	hummed	a	little	while	the	truck	drove	through	the	parking	lot	of	a	boarded-up	Kmart.	My	father	belched	softly	and	sighed.	“Crazy	from	the	heat,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Any	new	ladies	in	your	life?”	my	mother	suddenly	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	I	said.	“There’s	no	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	you	never	know	how	it’ll	happen,”	she	said.	“Look	at	your	father	and	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	met	by	accident.	Isn’t	that	right,	hon?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a>“Mm-hm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	already	know	the	story,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	pickup	turned	down	an	alley	between	warehouses.	Zoom	out.	More	cruisers approaching	the	alley’s	opposite	end.	No	place	to	turn	around	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	called	to	talk	to	his	cousin,”	my	mother	went	on,	as	if	she	hadn’t	heard	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only	she	was	in	the	shower.	We’d	just	been	sunbathing	in	the	backyard,	you see,	and	we	had	lotion	all	over	us.	I	showered	later,	when	I	got	home.	But	first	I answered	the	phone,	and	your	father	thought	I	was	his	cousin.	He	started	talking like	he	knew	me,	and	he	was	just	so	nice	and	funny	that	I	went	along	with	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	we	all	had	a	good	laugh	about	it	when	he	found	out,	but	we’d	gotten	on	so that	he	asked	me	out	for	a	date.	I	said	yes,	of	course,	and	the	next	thing	I	knew,	I was	walking	down	the	aisle	with	him.	And	now	here	we	are.	Isn’t	that	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	definitely	where	we	are,”	my	father	agreed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Police	cruisers	blocked	both	ends	of	the	alley	now.	The	pickup	stopped	in	the middle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Things	will	work	out,”	my	mother	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	really	looking	for	anything	right	now,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Still,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zoom	in.	A	man	in	jeans	and	a	white	T-shirt	jumped	out	of	the	pickup.	He	had	a pistol	in	his	hand.	He	started	running	for	one	of	the	warehouses,	and	then	a	little pink	cloud	puffed	from	his	head.	He	fell	to	the	ground.	Nothing	moved	but	the camera. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	gotta	hurt,”	my	father	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	what	things	are	coming	to	when	this	can	happen	here,”	my	mother sighed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	happening	in	California,”	I	pointed	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Still,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a>“Well,	I	should	probably	go,”	I	said.	“Have	to	get	up	for	work	in	the	morning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait!	Your	father	hasn’t	told	you	his	news	yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“News?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black-clad	officers	approached	the	fallen	man	slowly,	guns	leveled,	like	they expected	him	to	rise	at	any	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	father	cleared	his	throat.	“You	remember	my	back	problems?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	crushed	verticals?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	mean	your	vertebrae?”	I	asked.	Three	of	them	were	fused	together	in his	lower	back,	the	result	of	twenty	years	driving	a	truck.	He	hadn’t	been	able	to walk	straight	in	years,	let	alone	work.	The	doctors	had	given	up	on	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,”	he	said,	“they’re	gone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What,	the	vertebrae?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	the	problems.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	mean,	gone?”	I	asked.	“How	could	that	happen?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	that	preacher	we	like	to	watch	on	the	television?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	I	said	slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	cops	nudged	the	man	with	a	foot,	flipping	him	over.	He	stared	up	at the	helicopter,	his	face	a	blur	from	the	distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	were	watching	him	the	other	day,”	my	father	said,	“when	he	told	everyone he’d	been	touched	by	God	just	before	the	show	started.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	not	really	God,”	my	mother	interrupted.	“He	said	it	was	an	angel whispering	in	his	ear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	work	for	God,”	my	father	said.	“That’s	the	same	thing	in	my	book.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	back,”	I	pleaded. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a>“Right.	He	said	that	God	told	him	there’d	be	a	trucker	watching	that	day,	one with	back	problems.	He	told	me	to	touch	the	television	set.	Said	he’d	heal	me	if	I confessed	my	sins	and	believed.	So	I	went	and	kneeled	in	front	of	our	television and	put	my	arms	around	it.	And	I,	ah,	I	talked	about	a	few	different	things.	But the	most	important	thing	is	that	I	was	healed.	I	believed,	son.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	this	vision	then,	of	thousands	of	unemployed	truckers	across	North America	-	the	world,	even	-	kneeling	on	their	shaggy	carpets,	hugging	their television	sets,	confessing	their	sins,	while	their	wives	looked	on	and	wept. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	my	back	problems	are	gone	now,”	my	father	finished.	“Not	so	much	as	an itch	left.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Healed	by	television,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Television	and	God,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well.”	I	didn’t	know	what	else	to	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t	that	something?”	my	mother	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	really	have	to	go	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	cop	handcuffed	the	body,	and	then	another	cop	threw	a	blanket	over	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	there,”	my	mother	said.	“I	saw	it	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">IT	DOESN’T	GET	ANY	BETTER</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p169"></a>By	Peter	Darbyshire</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	WAS	ON	MY	WAY	to	Kennedy’s	wedding,	but	I	couldn’t	find	the	church.	I tried	the	Portuguese	neighbourhood,	the	Italian	neighbourhood,	everywhere.	I drove	all	around	the	city	looking	for	it.	It	was	called	Our	Lady	of	Perpetual Suffering,	but	all	the	churches	I	saw	were	named	after	men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	are	there	so	many	churches?”	I	wanted	to	know.	“I	mean,	who	goes	to these	places?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lane,	my	date,	just	shook	her	head	and	kept	brushing	hair	off	herself.	She	was also	my	hair	stylist,	and	she	was	covered	in	little	pieces	of	hair,	each	of	them	a different	colour.	She	was	still	wearing	the	same	clothes	she’d	had	on	when	she’d cut	my	hair:	white	silk	blouse,	camouflage	pants,	black	military	boots.	I’d originally	asked	Mia	to	be	my	date,	but	I	hadn’t	called	her	since	that	incident with	the	gun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	you	have	directions?”	Lane	asked	at	one	point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	had	the	directions,”	I	explained,	“but	then	I	lost	them	when	my	apartment	was robbed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	took	the	directions?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	took	everything,”	I	told	her.	“My	whole	life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	would	anybody	want	with	directions	to	a	wedding?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	would	anybody	want	with	my	life?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	STOPPED	AT	A	7-ELEVEN	to	look	up	the	address.	Somebody	had	thrown	up in	a	corner	of	the	phone	booth.	The	churches	section	of	the	yellow	pages	had been	ripped	out.	I	looked	in	the	white	pages,	but	there	was	no	listing.	It	started	to rain	again	while	I	was	in	there.	When	I	went	back	to	the	car,	Lane	had	a	bottle	of water	and	a	piece	of	paper	that	she	passed	to	me.	The	directions	to	the	church were	written	on	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’d	you	get	this?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p170"></a>“I	went	in	to	get	some	water,”	she	said,	holding	up	the	bottle.	“The	guy	behind the	counter	was	Hispanic,	so	I	figured	he	might	know	where	the	church	was.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t	that	racial	profiling	or	something	like	that?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	gave	me	the	address,”	she	pointed	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	just	saved	my	life,”	I	said.	I	went	to	hug	her,	but	she	warded	me	off with	the	water	bottle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Remember,”	she	said,	“this	isn’t	that	kind	of	date.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’D	ONLY	ASKED	LANE	to	be	my	date	that	morning,	when	I	was	getting	my hair	cut	for	the	wedding.	My	appointment	was	at	nine.	Lane	was	the	only	person working	in	the	salon,	although	there	was	a	man	sleeping	on	the	couch	beside	the sinks	at	the	back.	The	phone	was	ringing	the	whole	time	I	was	in	there,	but	Lane never	once	looked	at	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	at	this	party	last	night,”	she	said	by	way	of	greeting.	“I	took	these	pills and	now	I	can’t	sleep.”	She	wrapped	the	apron	around	me	like	she	was	tucking in	a	child. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	a	party	to	go	to	myself	tonight,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	so	tired,”	she	went	on.	“I	keep	hallucinating,	like	I’m	dreaming	even though	I’m	awake.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	long	do	these	pills	last?”	I	asked	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	she	said.	“But	if	it	goes	on	much	longer,	I	might	lose	my	mind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed	as	she	began	cutting	my	hair,	but	I	wasn’t	really	sure	why. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	if	you’re	still	up	later,	maybe	you’d	like	to	come	to	this	party,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stopped	cutting	and	looked	at	me	in	the	mirror.	The	man	on	the	couch	let	out a	long	sigh	and	rolled	over,	but	he	didn’t	wake	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	a	wedding	party,”	I	added.	“There’ll	be	lots	of	other	people	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	I’m	a	dyke,	don’t	you?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p171"></a>“That’s	all	right,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	it’s	all	right,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	drinks	will	be	free,”	I	added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	ruffled	my	hair	with	the	hand	that	held	the	scissors.	“As	long	as	we’re straight	on	that,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">WE	FOUND	THE	CHURCH	between	two	abandoned	warehouses	a	few	blocks away	from	the	7-Eleven.	The	building	looked	like	it	had	once	been	a	garage.	The Virgin	Mary	had	been	painted	over	the	front	door,	but	someone	had	spray-painted	out	the	baby	Jesus.	Now	she	just	held	a	black	circle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	went	inside	and	found	the	place	empty	except	for	a	man	in	a	priest’s	robe.	He was	sweeping	piles	of	confetti	across	the	floor,	but	he	paused	long	enough	to look	at	us.	“We’re	closed	for	a	private	event,”	he	said,	“but	we’ll	be	open	again later	tonight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	here	for	the	wedding,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	that.”	He	leaned	on	the	broom	and	gazed	at	Lane.	“You	just	missed	them,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	we’re	not	even	an	hour	late,”	I	said,	pointing	at	my	watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	were	in	and	out	in	half	an	hour,”	he	said.	“But	they	made	an	awful	mess in	that	time.	Someone	was	even	drinking	vodka	in	one	of	the	pews.”	He	nodded at	the	floor,	but	I	didn’t	see	any	bottles	anywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Was	it	a	nice	wedding	at	least?”	Lane	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nice?”	The	priest	looked	up	at	the	ceiling	of	the	church.	There	were	spider webs	in	the	rafters.	“They	called	her	parents	on	a	cell	phone	during	the ceremony.	I	had	to	say	all	the	vows	into	this	phone	so	they	could	hear	me.”	He shook	his	head	and	went	back	to	sweeping.	“I	don’t	know	these	people,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	never	seen	them	before,	and	I	doubt	I’ll	ever	see	them	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lane	lit	a	cigarette	and	looked	around	the	empty	room.	“I	don’t	suppose	they said	where	they	were	going?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p172"></a>“It’s	all	right,”	I	told	her.	“I	know	where	the	reception	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	where	it	is?”	Lane	said.	“Why	didn’t	we	just	go	there	then?	We could	have	skipped	this	whole	church	thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	it	wasn’t	for	the	money,”	the	priest	sighed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Was	there	a	woman	with	them?”	I	asked.	“One	with	a	tattoo	of	Marilyn	Monroe here?”	I	pointed	at	my	stomach,	just	above	my	belly	button. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	were	women,	yes,”	the	priest	said,	sweeping	the	confetti	towards	us,	“but I	don’t	know	about	any	tattoos.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Marilyn	Monroe?”	Lane	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	get	out	of	here,”	I	said	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everyone	always	leaves,”	the	priest	said,	following	us	with	the	broom,	“but nobody	ever	comes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">BACK	IN	THE	CAR,	Lane	laughed	and	brushed	more	hair	from	her	clothes.	“I can’t	believe	it,”	she	said.	“You	ask	me	out	on	a	date,	but	you’re	after	another woman.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	another	woman,”	I	said,	“it’s	my	ex-wife.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	at	me.	“Is	that	supposed	to	be	better?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	heard	she’d	be	here,”	I	said.	“I	haven’t	seen	her	in	a	year.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	this	is	certainly	going	to	be	an	interesting	night,”	Lane	said.	She	took	a long	drink	from	the	water	bottle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	care,	anyway?”	I	asked.	“You’re	a	dyke,	remember?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I	remember,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	what	does	it	really	matter	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	the	principle	of	the	thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p173"></a>THERE	WAS	A	FIGHT	going	on	in	the	parking	lot	of	the	reception	hall	when we	pulled	in.	There	were	three	or	four	men	involved,	I	couldn’t	quite	tell,	and another	three	or	four	standing	around,	watching.	They	all	stopped	what	they were	doing	and	looked	into	the	headlights,	even	the	fighters,	until	we	were	past them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Were	those	your	friends?”	Lane	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	friends	don’t	wear	rented	tuxes,”	I	told	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	parked	beside	an	SUV	with	a	white	dog	in	the	front	seat.	It	was	a	big	dog,	the size	of	a	German	shepherd	but	more	expensive-looking.	It	started	barking	at Lane	as	soon	she	got	out	of	the	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	doggie,”	she	said	in	a	baby	voice	and	put	her	hand	on	the	window.	The dog	bit	at	the	glass,	trying	to	get	at	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	really	don’t	think	you	should	do	that,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	be	mad	too	if	I	was	locked	up	in	this	all	day,”	she	told	the	dog.	She	kicked the	side	door	of	the	SUV,	and	its	alarm	went	off.	The	dog	threw	itself	at	the window	now,	leaving	smears	of	saliva	on	the	glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	probably	thirsty,”	Lane	said.	She	put	the	bottle	of	water	up	to	the	open	crack at	the	top	of	the	window	and	poured	the	rest	of	its	contents	inside.	The	dog lunged	at	it,	snarling	its	way	through	the	water.	“You	see?”	Lane	said,	tossing	the empty	bottle	aside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	went	past	the	fighting	men.	There	were	three	of	them	now,	I	saw,	rolling around	on	the	ground,	in	and	out	of	puddles	formed	by	the	rain.	Each	of	them seemed	to	be	fighting	the	other	two.	And	the	men	around	them	were	dirty	and wiping	blood	from	their	own	faces	and	hands.	One	of	them,	who	had	his	arm around	the	neck	of	the	man	beside	him,	lifted	his	beer	bottle	to	us	as	we	passed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">None	of	them	said	anything,	though,	and	the	only	sound	was	the	grunts	of	the fighting	men.	We	went	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	hall	was	actually	two	large	rooms	separated	by	a	hallway	that	held	the washrooms.	There	seemed	to	be	a	different	wedding	reception	taking	place	in each	room.	I	looked	in	the	room	to	the	right	but	didn’t	recognize	anyone	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bride	was	dancing	in	the	middle	of	the	room	to	an	old	Whitney	Houston</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p174"></a>song.	She	looked	as	if	her	nose	had	been	broken	a	number	of	times.	I	wasn’t sure,	but	I	thought	the	man	she	was	dancing	with	might	have	been	her	father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	also	looked	as	if	she	wouldn’t	be	able	to	stand	up	without	his	help.	Everyone else	was	sitting	at	their	tables,	watching	them	dance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	these	your	friends?”	Lane	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	these	look	like	my	friends?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	really	wouldn’t	know,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“These	don’t	look	like	anybody’s	friends,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	went	into	the	other	room.	All	the	tables	had	been	pulled	to	the	walls	here, and	everyone	was	dancing	in	the	empty	space	in	the	middle	of	the	room.	I	didn’t recognize	the	music,	and	I	also	didn’t	recognize	most	of	the	people	here.	I looked	around	for	Kennedy	and	spotted	him	by	the	gift	table,	taking	photos	of the	crowd	with	a	digital	camera. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	way,”	I	told	Lane. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	I’m	going	to	get	a	drink,”	she	said.	She	pushed	her	way	through	the crowd,	to	the	bar	on	the	other	side	of	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kennedy	was	staring	at	a	picture	of	himself	in	the	camera	when	I	got	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	just	missed	you	at	the	church,”	I	told	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	up	from	the	camera	and	grinned	when	he	saw	me.	“Hey,	I	thought maybe	you	weren’t	going	to	make	it,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	I	know	anyone	here,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“These	things	are	like	high	school	reunions,”	he	said,	nodding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	is	she?”	I	asked,	glancing	around	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	pointed	to	a	woman	on	the	dance	floor.	She	was	in	the	middle	of	the	crowd but	she	was	dancing	alone,	as	everyone	kept	a	few	feet	away	from	her.	Her	eyes were	closed.	She	was	wearing	a	white	bridal	gown.	I	actually	took	a	step	toward her	before	I	realized	she	didn’t	look	anything	like	Rachel. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p175"></a>“Who’s	that?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	my	wife,”	Kennedy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	more	I	stared	at	her,	the	more	familiar	she	looked.	Then	I	remembered	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	one	of	the	women	that	Kennedy	had	danced	with	that	night	I’d	gone over	to	his	place	and	wound	up	with	Mia.	He	didn’t	even	know	her	then,	and now	here	he	was,	marrying	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’s	my	wife?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	talking	about?”	Kennedy	asked,	looking	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	told	me	Rachel	would	be	here,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	where	Rachel	is,”	he	said,	shaking	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	said	she’d	be	here	when	you	invited	me	to	the	wedding,”	I	said.	“You	said you’d	found	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	said	I’d	found	some	photographs	of	Rachel,”	Kennedy	said.	“I	said	I’d	bring them	to	the	wedding.”	He	handed	the	camera	to	me.	“They’re	in	here, somewhere	near	the	beginning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	down	at	the	camera	in	my	hand.	It	was	warm	from	him	holding	it,	and slick	with	sweat.	“So	she’s	not	here?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	never	been	here,”	he	said	and	moved	off	into	the	crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	started	to	go	through	the	pictures	in	the	camera,	looking	for	Rachel,	but	just then	Lane	appeared	at	my	side,	a	gin	and	tonic	in	each	hand.	“You	have	to	pay for	the	drinks	here,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	said	they’d	be	free,”	she	went	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	get	them,”	I	told	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	already	paid	for	these	ones,”	she	said,	“but	you’re	getting	the	rest.”	She took	a	sip	of	one	of	the	drinks,	then	she	saw	Kennedy’s	wife.	She	watched	her</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p176"></a>for	a	moment	and	then	smiled.	“I	think	I’m	going	to	dance	now,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	around	the	edge	of	the	room,	looking	for	a	quiet	place	where	I	could	sit down	and	look	at	the	pictures	in	the	camera.	But	there	were	people	everywhere, standing	or	sitting	in	groups,	talking	and	laughing	and	watching	me	pass.	I	went out	into	the	hall,	just	as	Kennedy	was	coming	out	of	the	restroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	let	me	see	that	for	a	moment,”	he	said,	taking	the	camera	from	me.	He went	up	to	the	door	of	the	other	room	and	started	taking	photos. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	doing?”	I	asked	him.	“That’s	not	your	party.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	you	think	I	know	that?”	he	said.	He	took	a	photo	of	the	other	bride	as	she ran	past	him	and	outside.	She	was	gagging	and	covering	her	mouth	with	one hand,	while	dragging	one	of	the	bridesmaids	behind	her	with	the	other.	“This	is going	to	make	a	great	album,”	Kennedy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be	careful	with	that,”	I	told	him.	“I	haven’t	looked	at	all	the	pictures	yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	didn’t	answer	me,	though,	because	just	then	one	of	the	fighting	men	from outside	came	in	and	saw	him	standing	there	with	the	camera.	“What	the	hell	do you	think	you’re	doing?”	this	man	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kennedy	didn’t	answer	him,	just	grinned	and	took	his	picture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	goddamn	perverts,”	the	other	man	said.	He	lunged	forward,	but	Kennedy stepped	behind	me,	so	the	man	hit	me	instead,	punching	me	in	the	face.	I	fell backward,	into	Kennedy,	who	shoved	me	forward	again,	back	at	the	other	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	caught	me,	holding	me	in	his	arms	for	what	seemed	like	moments,	and	then dropped	me	to	the	wood-tiled	floor.	Down	here,	everything	smelled	like	lemons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	managed	to	lift	my	head	again,	I	saw	Kennedy	wrestling	with	the	other man.	The	camera	had	fallen	to	the	floor,	and	the	other	man	was	stomping	on	it while	holding	Kennedy	in	a	headlock.	Little	pieces	of	the	camera	were	flying everywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	screamed	and	grabbed	hold	of	the	man’s	foot.	He	was	wearing	one	of	those shiny	dress	shoes,	the	kind	you	can	only	get	with	rented	tuxes.	He	screamed back	at	me	and	tried	to	kick	me	with	his	other	foot	but	lost	his	balance	instead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	fell	to	the	floor,	taking	Kennedy	with	him,	and	I	heard	rather	than	saw	his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p177"></a>head	bounce	off	the	floor.	I	got	on	my	knees	and	grabbed	the	camera,	looked	at the	picture	screen.	It	was	black,	a	crack	running	straight	down	the	middle	of	it.	I hit	every	button	I	could	see	on	the	camera.	The	screen	stayed	black. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jesus,”	Kennedy	said	behind	me,	“I	think	you	killed	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	around	and	looked	at	the	other	man.	He	was	spasming	on	the	floor, limbs	jerking	back	and	forth,	his	eyes	rolled	back	so	only	the	whites	were showing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me?”	I	said.	“You	were	the	one	who	started	this.”	I	could	barely	breathe.	I thought	I	was	going	to	faint. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you	were	the	one	who	kicked	his	ass,”	Kennedy	said.	He	pulled	me	to	my feet	and	put	his	arms	around	me.	“This	is	the	best	wedding	I’ve	been	to	yet,”	he said	and	kissed	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	wasn’t	what	I	really	wanted,	but	it	was	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">LATER,	WHEN	THE	other	groom	-	I	knew	he	was	the	other	groom	because	he was	the	only	person	wearing	a	white	jacket	-	came	in	and	started	fighting	with Kennedy,	I	went	back	into	Kennedy’s	reception	room	to	get	Lane.	She	was dancing	with	Kennedy’s	wife,	and	when	I	went	up	to	them	and	told	her	I	was leaving,	she	just	waved	me	away.	I	went	back	into	the	hall	again.	Kennedy	and the	other	groom	were	rolling	around	on	the	floor	and	over	the	guy	having	the seizure,	biting	and	clawing	at	each	other	and	laughing.	I	went	back	out	into	the rain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside,	the	other	bride	was	sitting	in	the	middle	of	the	parking	lot.	Somehow, the	white	dog	from	the	SUV	had	gotten	loose	and	it	was	attacking	her,	trying	to get	underneath	her	wedding	gown	to	bite	at	her	ankles.	She’d	kick	it	away,	and then	it	would	come	back	again,	lunging	underneath	the	gown.	The	white	silk	was torn	all	along	the	bottom	of	the	dress	now	and	stained	from	sitting	on	the	wet ground.	The	woman	was	crying	when	I	walked	past	her.	“I	just	want	to	go home,”	she	kept	saying	to	the	dog.	It	barked	at	her	and	didn’t	pay	any	attention to	me	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stopped	and	watched	this	for	a	moment,	then	said,	“I’ll	give	you	a	ride.”	I helped	her	to	her	feet.	She’d	lost	one	of	her	shoes	somewhere,	so	she	took	my arm	as	I	led	her	to	the	car.	The	dog	followed,	growling	and	biting	at	her	heels. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p178"></a>There	was	a	couple	making	out	in	the	front	seat	of	the	SUV.	I	wasn’t	sure	if	they were	the	owners	or	not,	because	the	car	alarm	was	still	going	off.	I	unlocked	the passenger	door	of	my	car,	and	the	woman	got	in.	The	dog	got	up	on	its	hind	legs and	looked	in	at	her	as	soon	as	I	closed	the	door.	Its	tail	was	wagging	furiously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	are	you	staying?”	I	asked	her	when	I	got	in	on	the	driver’s	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Holiday	Inn,”	she	said.	She’d	stopped	crying	now,	but	she	made	no	move to	wipe	the	mascara	from	her	face.	There	was	still	a	bit	of	vomit	on	her	chin.	She looked	like	a	raccoon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	that	where	your	husband’s	staying?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	that’s	where	he’s	staying,”	she	said.	“Where	else	would	he	go?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	just	want	to	make	sure	he’ll	know	where	to	find	you,”	I	told	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	way	out	of	the	parking	lot,	the	headlights	caught	a	fox	in	the	shrubs.	It looked	like	it	had	a	kitten	in	its	mouth,	but	I	wasn’t	certain	because	it	ran	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	this	your	first	wedding?”	I	asked	the	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	my	only	wedding,”	she	said.	Then,	“Do	you	have	any	cigarettes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	smoke,”	I	said.	“But	I’m	sure	you	can	get	some	from	one	of	the	hotel’s vending	machines.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	have	any	money,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	your	wedding	night,”	I	said.	“Think	of	all	the	money	you	just	made.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	what	I	mean	is	that	this	dress	doesn’t	have	any	pockets.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On	our	wedding	night,”	I	went	on,	“we	piled	all	the	money	we	got	on	the	bed and	made	love	in	it.	We	didn’t	even	count	it	until	we	were	done.	Nearly	six thousand	dollars.	We	left	a	hundred-dollar	tip	for	the	maid.	For	luck,	my	wife said.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’s	your	wife	now?”	she	asked	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	dead,”	I	told	her.	It	was	true.	I	knew	now	I	was	never	going	to	see	Rachel</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p179"></a>again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I’m	sorry,”	the	woman	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head.	“I’ve	never	had	that	much	money	since,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	say	anything	for	a	moment,	just	looked	out	the	side	window.	I	could see	strands	of	the	dog’s	saliva	still	on	the	window,	trapped	in	her	reflection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	it	then,”	she	sighed.	“The	best	night	of	my	life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	doesn’t	get	any	better,”	I	agreed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THERE’S	NOTHING	WRONG	WITH	ME</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p180"></a>By	Peter	Darbyshire</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	WAS	WORKING	as	an	actor.	I	got	the	job	through	a	number	Eden	gave	me after	they	let	him	out	of	jail.	When	I	called	the	number,	the	woman	who answered	told	me	to	come	in	to	the	office	so	she	could	see	what	I	looked	like. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	want	to	know	anything	else	about	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Should	I	bring	a	resum�?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you	like,”	she	said,	“but	it’s	not	really	necessary.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	references?”	I	asked.	“I’m	sure	I	could	find	somebody	to	give	me	a good	reference.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	really	that	kind	of	job,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	don’t	you	need	to	know	about	my	work	experience	and	all	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	I	need	to	know	is	that	you	look	normal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	office	was	a	studio	in	an	east-end	warehouse.	There	were	Asian	men working	behind	computers	in	the	room	next	to	it.	They	stared	at	me	as	I	walked past	but	they	never	stopped	typing.	A	fan	blew	the	smell	of	sweat	out	into	the hallway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	walls	of	the	office	I	went	into	were	lined	with	old	movie	posters	and	black-and-white	photographs	of	people	I	didn’t	recognize.	Half	the	office	was	taken	up with	sealed	packing	boxes.	The	woman	I’d	talked	to	on	the	phone	sat	behind	the desk	that	was	in	the	other	half	of	the	room.	She	was	dressed	in	shorts	and	a	black T-shirt,	and	she	was	playing	solitaire	on	her	computer	when	I	walked	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	just	looked	at	me	for	a	moment	after	I	introduced	myself,	then	nodded	to herself.	“I	guess	you	look	all	right,”	she	said,	“but	I	need	to	ask	you	a	few questions.”	She	motioned	for	me	to	sit	in	one	of	the	two	chairs,	then	pulled	a form	out	of	her	desk.	There	was	a	coffeemaker	with	a	full	pot	of	coffee	sitting	on the	windowsills,	but	she	didn’t	offer	me	anything	to	drink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	have	a	car?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p181"></a>“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have	you	ever	threatened	a	co-worker	with	violence	or	stolen	from	your employer?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	one	question?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	tapped	her	pen	on	the	table	but	didn’t	say	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bondable?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	does	all	this	have	to	do	with	acting?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	should	tell	you	now,”	she	said,	gazing	out	the	window,	“that	this	job	will	not lead	to	any	big	breaks	in	the	movie	industry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bondable,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have	you	ever	tried	to	associate	with	any	actors	against	their	will	or	followed them	without	their	knowledge?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	really,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	really,”	she	repeated,	looking	back	at	me	again.	“Now	what	does	that mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	made	a	few	more	notes,	which	I	couldn’t	see	because	she	shielded	them	with her	hand,	then	put	the	form	back	in	the	desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	do	you	have	a	job	for	me?”	I	asked	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	the	perfect	job	for	you,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	AGENCY	GOT	ME	a	television	commercial	job.	I	was	paid	seventy dollars	and	a	free	breakfast	for	an	hour’s	work.	There	were	fifty	of	us,	all	from different	agencies	around	the	city.	We	were	playing	the	parts	of	business	people on	our	way	to	work.	The	shoot	took	place	in	front	of	the	stock	exchange</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p182"></a>downtown.	The	street	was	blocked	off	at	either	end	with	yellow	tape.	We	walked along	the	sidewalk	in	front	of	the	cameras	in	small	groups,	carrying	briefcases and	bags	the	costumes	woman	had	given	us.	I	was	wearing	the	same	suit	that	I’d worn	the	day	I	married	Rachel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	assistant	director	briefed	us	at	the	beginning	of	the	shoot.	He	was	chewing gum	rapidly	and	his	hands	shook	the	whole	time	he	talked	to	us.	“Look	like	you have	somewhere	important	to	go,”	he	said.	“But	don’t	overact	-	you’re	just	the background	for	the	shot.”	It	was	the	only	direction	anyone	ever	gave	us.	The only	other	people	who	spoke	to	us	were	the	production	assistants,	two	women	in baseball	caps	and	sunglasses	who	stood	at	either	side	of	the	set	and	told	us	when to	walk	in	front	of	the	cameras.	They	kept	coffee	cups	to	their	lips	the	whole time,	breathing	in	the	steam	even	when	they	weren’t	drinking.	It	was	five	in	the morning.	The	buildings	all	around	us	were	lit	up	even	though	no	one	was	in them	yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	watched	the	shooting	from	the	side	of	the	set	while	waiting	my	turn	to	walk	in front	of	the	cameras.	The	stars,	two	men	in	nicer	suits	than	anyone	else’s,	stood talking	at	the	edge	of	the	sidewalk	while	the	extras	walked	at	least	five	feet behind	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	have	to	keep	them	on	a	different	plane,”	one	of	the	other	extras,	a	black man	with	a	French	accent,	told	me.	“Or	the	audience	won’t	know	who’s important.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	stars	was	Mercedes’s	boyfriend,	the	man	that	I’d	whipped	in	The Code	that	day.	I	was	afraid	that	he	would	see	me	and	have	me	kicked	off	the	set. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	he	looked	right	at	me	during	a	break	in	the	filming	and	he	didn’t	even	blink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	garbage	everywhere	on	the	streets	that	morning.	When	it	was	my	turn to	walk	in	front	of	the	camera,	the	wind	carried	a	stray	piece	of	newspaper	into my	leg.	I	tried	to	shake	it	off,	but	it	wrapped	around	my	leg.	There	was	a photograph	of	a	group	of	firemen	standing	around	a	burning	tanker	truck	on	the outside	page.	I	bent	down	to	pull	it	off,	but	the	man	with	the	French	accent bumped	into	me	from	behind.	“Keep	going,”	he	hissed.	I	kept	walking	until	I was	at	the	edge	of	the	set.	The	newspaper	remained	on	my	leg	the	whole	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	real	business	people	began	showing	up	a	few	hours	after	we	began	shooting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	stood	behind	the	tape	at	the	edges	of	the	set,	checking	their	watches	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p183"></a>waiting	for	us	to	finish.	Those	of	us	who’d	already	been	in	the	shoot	stood around	the	food	tables,	eating	muffins	and	drinking	lukewarm	coffees.	While	I watched,	a	pair	of	men	in	tan	overcoats	and	black	briefcases	stepped	around	the tape	and	walked	through	the	set	the	same	way	we	had,	while	the	cameras	were rolling,	and	went	into	the	building.	No	one	seemed	to	notice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	wrapped	the	shoot	a	few	minutes	after	that.	The	production	assistants	took down	the	tape	while	the	camera	crews	cleared	the	street.	Suddenly	there	were young	men	in	shorts	and	baseball	caps	everywhere,	coiling	cables	or	moving lights.	The	costumes	woman	collected	all	the	briefcases	from	the	extras.	Within moments	you	couldn’t	tell	there	had	been	a	film	shoot	there	at	all,	except	for	the trailers	and	the	extras	still	standing	around	in	a	group.	I	had	no	idea	where	the stars	had	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	found	myself	beside	the	man	with	the	French	accent	again.	“Well,	now	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	we	wait	for	the	cheque,”	he	said.	“If	it	takes	any	longer	than	a	week,	call your	agent.	These	guys	may	not	be	in	business	a	month	from	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	do	a	lot	of	this	kind	of	thing?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	all	I	do,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	television	commercials	are	your	job?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Blending	in	is	my	job,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	of	the	other	extras	went	down	the	street	to	catch	the	bus,	but	I	went	over	to where	one	of	the	cameramen	was	pouring	himself	a	cup	of	coffee.	“How	did	I look?”	I	asked	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	squinted	at	me	and	said,	“Who	are	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	one	of	the	extras,”	I	said.	“I	had	the	newspaper	on	my	leg.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	right.”	He	took	a	pill	from	his	pocket	and	ground	it	up	in	his	hand,	dropped the	powder	into	his	coffee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	just	wondering	how	everything	worked	out,”	I	said.	“Did	I	look	real?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p184"></a>“Oh	yeah,”	he	said,	stirring	the	powder	under.	“Better	than	real.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	AGENCY	GOT	ME	all	kinds	of	shoots.	Once,	I	was	hired	to	be	an audience	member	for	a	new	talk	show.	We	shot	it	in	the	middle	of	the	night,	in	a downtown	studio.	I	sat	between	a	woman	doing	a	crossword	puzzle	and	a	man who	looked	under	his	seat	when	he	sat	down.	“Sometimes	the	day	show	puts prizes	there	and	people	forget	to	take	them,”	he	explained	to	me.	“Or	sometimes people	just	forgot	what	they	brought.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	day	show?”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	the	show	the	set	belongs	to,”	he	said,	nodding	at	the	stage.	There	was nothing	up	there	but	a	beige	backdrop	and	four	chairs	that	had	been	taken	from the	back	row	of	the	audience.	“It’s	been	on	for	years.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	they	changed	the	chairs,”	the	woman	on	my	other	side	said.	“The	day	show has	those	upholstered	ones.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	yeah,”	the	man	said.	“They	wouldn’t	want	to	waste	those	on	this	operation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	day	show	is	those	chairs,”	the	woman	added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	host	came	out	of	the	back	just	then	and	started	talking	to	the	one cameraman.	He	still	wore	the	cloth	to	protect	his	suit	from	the	makeup.	His	skin looked	orange. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	many	times	have	you	worked	for	this	show?”	I	asked	the	man	beside	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	the	first	time,”	he	said.	“It’s	the	pilot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you’ve	worked	here	before,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	one	of	these	pilots	every	week,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	how	many	of	them	make	it	to	air?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	haven’t	seen	any	yet,”	he	said.	“But	all	it	takes	is	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	man	wearing	a	headset	and	carrying	a	plastic	bag	walked	over	and	said	to	me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	have	to	take	that	shirt	off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p185"></a>I	looked	down	at	my	shirt.	It	was	a	plain	black	T-shirt.	“But	it’s	all	I	have,”	I said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Too	many	Tshirts	in	the	crowd,”	he	said.	“Everyone	looks	unemployed.	We need	some	professional-type	people.”	He	reached	into	the	bag	and	took	out	a white	button-down,	tossed	it	at	me.	“Just	remember	to	give	that	back	when	the shoot’s	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	off	my	T-shirt	and	dropped	it	under	my	chair,	put	on	the	button-down.	My skin	started	itching	right	away.	I	couldn’t	stop	thinking	of	lice	and	crabs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	host	gave	us	a	speech	before	they	started	the	show.	He	was	still	wearing	his makeup	cloth.	“Remember,”	he	said,	“we’re	the	new	kind	of	talk	show.	We	don’t want	people	sitting	on	their	chairs	clapping	when	the	applause	sign	comes	on and	then	stopping	when	it	goes	off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	they	even	have	the	budget	for	an	applause	sign?”	the	woman	beside	me asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	want	people	throwing	their	chairs,”	the	host	went	on.	“We	want confrontation.	Conflict.	Drama.	Spectacle.	Don’t	be	afraid	to	shout	things	out	or do	something	spontaneous.	If	you’re	exciting	enough,	we	may	even	get	picked up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	gave	the	exact	same	speech	with	the	last	pilot,”	the	man	beside	me muttered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	host	walked	to	the	center	of	the	stage	and	nodded	at	the	camera.	The	man who’d	made	me	change	shirts	ran	up	and	yanked	off	the	host’s	makeup	cloth, then	went	to	the	edge	of	the	stage	and	held	up	a	sign	that	had	Quiet	hand-painted on	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Welcome	to	The	Zone,”	the	host	said	to	the	camera,	“your	new	guide	to	the afternoon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	beside	me	rolled	her	eyes	and	looked	at	the	ceiling.	The	man	on	my other	side	looked	under	my	chair	and	picked	up	a	dime	off	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll	like	today’s	show,”	the	host	said.	“It’s	about	people	who	are	afraid	of	the end	of	the	world.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p186"></a>The	man	with	the	Quiet	sign	yelled	“Cut!”	and	the	host	sat	on	one	of	the	chairs while	the	cameraman	moved	the	camera	into	a	new	position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	a	sorry	fucking	operation,”	the	man	beside	me	sighed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t	everyone	afraid	of	the	end	of	the	world?”	the	woman	on	my	other	side asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	first	guest	was	a	man	in	a	military	uniform.	The	host	told	the	camera	that	he was	a	colonel	in	the	army. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ex-colonel,”	the	other	man	said.	“They	kicked	me	out	on	account	of	me revealing	all	their	dirty	little	secrets.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	secrets	are	those?”	the	host	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ex-colonel	leaned	forward	and	glanced	between	the	host	and	the	camera. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	already	poisoning	us	slowly,”	he	said	in	a	stage	whisper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who’s	poisoning	us?”	the	host	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	government,”	the	ex-colonel	said.	“They’re	putting	chemicals	and	nuclear waste	in	the	water.	Next	it’ll	be	a	nuclear	device	in	one	of	our	cities.	Maybe	not a	full-scale	one,	but	a	dirty	nuke	at	least.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	would	they	do	that?”	the	host	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	they	can	increase	our	taxes,”	the	ex-colonel	said.	“On	account	of	the	threat and	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	exactly	does	all	this	have	to	do	with	the	end	of	the	world?”	the	host asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ex-colonel	leaned	back	in	his	chair.	“Where	there’s	one	nuke,	there’s	more,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	said.	“You	can	make	them	with	intel	from	the	Internet	now.	All	it	takes	is	one to	start,	and	pretty	soon	everyone’s	blowing	one	off	in	the	back	of	a	rental truck.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	the	host	said,	shaking	his	head.	“Let’s	see	what	the	audience thinks.”	He	looked	out	at	us,	and	for	a	moment	no	one	said	anything.	The	ex-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p187"></a>colonel	cleared	his	throat	several	times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	raised	my	hand.	The	host	quickly	pointed	at	me.	“You	have	something	to	say,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	said.	The	man	and	woman	beside	me	turned	and	stared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	you’ve	been	watching	too	much	television,”	I	told	the	ex-colonel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes!”	the	host	said,	nodding.	The	man	who’d	been	holding	the	Quiet	sign	now held	up	a	sign	that	had	Applause	painted	on	it,	and	audience	members	here	and there	clapped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	all	true,”	the	ex-colonel	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	so,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Haven’t	you	been	watching	the	news?”	the	ex-colonel	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	fact,”	I	went	on,	“I	think	I	saw	that	very	movie	last	week.”	The	man	with	the sign	raised	it	over	his	head	and	more	people	applauded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ex-colonel	stood	up,	knocking	his	chair	over	as	he	did	so.	“All	right,”	he said,	“pretend	like	nothing’s	happening.”	He	walked	off	the	stage	and	into	the back	area.	He	paused	just	before	going	around	the	backdrop.	“But	don’t	say	I didn’t	warn	you	when	you’re	nothing	but	a	shadow	burned	into	the	side	of	a building.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	saw	that	show	too,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	wrong	with	you?”	the	man	beside	me	asked	when	the	ex-colonel	was gone	and	the	crew	were	getting	ready	for	the	next	segment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know,	I	know,”	I	said.	“That	guy	has	probably	been	trained	how	to	kill	me	a thousand	different	ways.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	I	went	to	theatre	school	with	him,”	the	woman	on	my	other	side	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	second	segment	of	the	show	was	a	family.	A	balding	husband	in	a	navy blazer,	a	daughter	with	braces,	a	mother	with	black	hair	and	red-framed	glasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	Iris,	although	I	didn’t	know	her	name	at	the	time.	The	host	asked	them what	they	were	afraid	of. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p188"></a>“Asteroids,”	the	husband	said.	“It’s	only	a	matter	of	time	before	a	planet-killer hits	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	seen	that	movie	too,”	the	host	said,	looking	at	the	audience	and	rolling his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	that	to	the	dinosaurs,”	the	husband	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	you,	darling?”	the	host	asked	the	daughter.	“What	are	you	afraid of?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nuclear	meltdown,”	the	girl	said.	“Radioactive	fallout	that	kills	all	the	livestock and	causes	cancer	for	hundreds	of	miles	away	from	the	epicenter.	Firestorms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nuclear	winter.	Entire	cities	abandoned.	Outbreaks	of	disease.	Foot	and	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tuberculosis.	AIDS.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	host	just	looked	at	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like	that	Chernobyl	show,”	the	girl	added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	been	letting	her	watch	A&amp;E,”	the	husband	said,	nodding	and	smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	what	about	you?”	the	host	asked,	turning	to	Iris.	“What	are	you	afraid	of?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“God,”	Iris	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“God,”	the	host	repeated.	He	looked	at	the	camera	and	smiled,	but	it	didn’t	reach his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“God	is	the	atom,”	Iris	said.	“Remember,	when	Oppenheimer	saw	the	atomic bomb	explode	at	Los	Alamos,	he	said,	‘Lo,	I	am	become	God,	destroyer	of worlds.’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who’s	this	Oppenheimer?”	the	host	asked,	frowning.	“Is	he	a	terrorist	or something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“God	is	our	destroyer,”	Iris	went	on,	“and	only	God	can	save	us	from	himself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	dropped	off	her	chair,	to	her	knees.	“Let	us	pray.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	host	didn’t	know	what	to	say.	He	looked	to	us	for	help. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p189"></a>Iris	dragged	her	husband	and	daughter	down	to	the	floor	with	her.	The	little	girl actually	started	to	cry.	“Who	will	join	us?”	Iris	asked.	She	looked	out	over	the audience,	and	our	eyes	met.	She	stared	at	me	for	a	few	seconds,	and	then	I	was up	out	of	my	chair	and	pushing	past	the	woman	beside	me	and	running	up	to kneel	on	the	stage	too.	The	host’s	jaw	actually	dropped	as	I	went	past	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Iris	took	my	hand	and	smiled	at	me.	Then	she	looked	straight	into	the	camera. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Heavenly	father,	destroyer	of	worlds,”	she	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	could	I	not	fall	in	love	with	her? </p>
<p class="calibre1">AS	IT	TURNED	OUT,	Iris	worked	for	the	same	agency	as	me.	Once,	it	got	us work	together	in	a	commercial.	This	one	was	in	a	burned-out	warehouse	across the	city.	The	shoot	took	place	in	the	front	lobby.	It	was	just	one	scene:	Iris	and	I had	to	walk	hand	in	hand	across	the	lobby,	which	the	crew	had	cleaned	and	filled with	fake	potted	plants.	We	were	in	the	background	of	the	shot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	in	the	foreground?”	I	asked	the	woman	in	charge	as	she	directed	the cameramen	where	to	set	up	their	equipment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	she	said.	“They’re	going	to	add	it	in	later	with	computers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	the	product?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shook	her	head.	“I	don’t	know	that	either.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	people	will	still	be	able	to	see	us,	right?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	yeah,”	she	said,	“you’ll	be	stars.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Iris	had	a	son	who	came	to	the	shoot	with	her.	This	was	her	real	son	-	the	family from	the	talk	show	worked	for	our	agency	too.	This	boy	was	in	a	wheelchair,	and when	I	looked	close	I	could	tell	there	was	something	not	quite	right	about	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	the	body	of	a	boy,	but	his	skin	was	all	wrinkled	and	his	hair	was	starting to	fall	out,	like	he	was	an	old	man.	Iris	parked	his	wheelchair	to	the	side	of	one of	the	cameras,	where	he	could	watch	us	work.	He	had	a	camera	of	his	own	-	a digital	one	-	and	he	filmed	the	crew	setting	up	with	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	asked	Iris	what	was	wrong	with	him	while	she	was	doing	her	stretching exercises. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p190"></a>“He’s	got	that	aging	disease,”	she	said,	not	looking	up	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	it	fatal?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aging	usually	is,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	his	name?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Walker,”	Iris	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t	that	a	little	ironic?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	what	you	mean,”	she	said,	doing	the	splits	and	touching	her	head to	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wandered	around	the	place	while	we	were	waiting.	The	rest	of	the	warehouse was	divided	into	large	rooms,	each	holding	different	appliances.	One	room	was full	of	televisions	stacked	on	skids	that	had	been	put	down	in	loose,	winding rows.	Another	room	was	full	of	fridges	and	microwaves,	their	white	exteriors scorched	by	the	fire	that	had	closed	down	the	place.	Another	room	was computers	piled	loosely	on	the	floor.	For	some	reason,	the	monitor	on	each	one had	been	smashed.	Water	dripped	from	the	ceiling	in	each	of	the	rooms,	and	I could	still	smell	smoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back	in	the	lobby,	I	asked	the	woman	in	charge	what	kind	of	warehouse	this was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	she	said,	“I	think	it	was	one	of	those	places	they	stored	things that	nobody	wants	any	more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	wouldn’t	want	all	of	this?”	I	wondered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	mean,	I	think	it’s	stuff	that’s	not	in	fashion	any	more,”	she	said.	“You	know, things	that	got	old	before	people	were	done	with	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I	know	all	about	that,”	I	said,	but	she	didn’t	answer	because	the	cameramen were	yelling	that	they	were	ready	for	the	shot.	Iris	and	I	took	our	places. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	walked	across	the	room,	hand	in	hand.	Iris’s	palm	was	moist	in	mine,	and	I could	feel	her	heartbeat	when	our	wrists	touched.	When	we	were	done,	I	asked</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p191"></a>the	woman	in	charge	how	it	looked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	supposed	to	be	in	love,”	she	said,	shaking	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	we	are,”	I	said.	“See?”	I	was	still	holding	Iris’s	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	try	to	show	it	more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	would	we	do	that?”	Iris	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	look,”	the	other	woman	said.	“A	smile.	Something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	about	a	kiss?”	I	suggested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	not	get	carried	away	here,”	Iris	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	went	over	to	where	Walker	sat	in	his	wheelchair.	He’d	filmed	all	this	but	he put	the	camera	down	when	we	approached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	get	it?”	Iris	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walker	nodded	but	didn’t	say	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	filming	this	for?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	for	the	archives,”	Iris	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	see,”	I	said,	although	I	didn’t.	I	reached	out	and	ruffled	Walker’s	hair,	and when	I	brought	my	hand	away,	there	were	individual	strands	of	hair	clinging	to it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	don’t	do	that,”	Iris	told	me.	“He	needs	all	he’s	got.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	they	were	ready	with	the	cameras	once	more,	Iris	and	I	went	and	did	the shot	again.	This	time	I	looked	over	at	her	and	smiled	as	we	walked.	She	smiled back.	I	squeezed	her	hand.	She	squeezed	mine	back.	It	was	like	we	were	actually a	couple. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	was	better,”	the	woman	in	charge	said	when	we	had	crossed	the	lobby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	more	time,	just	in	case.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p192"></a>Iris	went	to	talk	to	Walker	again,	but	he	was	gone	now.	His	wheelchair	was	still there,	but	it	was	empty	except	for	the	camera	on	the	seat.	“Walker?”	she	called, looking	around.	“Where	are	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	mean	he	can	actually	walk?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	he	can	walk,”	she	said,	pausing	to	look	at	me.	“What	did	you	think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	the	wheelchair	is	just	for	show?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Walker!”	she	cried,	turning	in	a	circle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	in	charge	came	over.	“What’s	the	problem?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our	son	is	missing,”	I	told	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	have	to	find	him,”	Iris	said.	“I	don’t	know	where	I’d	be	without	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	organize	a	search	party,”	I	said	to	the	woman	in	charge.	“We’ll	divide	up into	teams	and	mark	things	off	on	grids	and	stuff.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	go	ahead,”	she	said.	“We’re	going	to	set	up	for	the	shot	again.	Try	to	find him	before	we’re	ready.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Iris	and	I	went	into	the	room	with	all	the	refrigerators	and	microwaves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Walker!”	she	cried	again.	She	opened	a	freezer	and	looked	inside,	like	he	was hiding	in	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	he	was	mad	at	us,”	I	said,	“on	account	of	the	shoot	and	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	talking	about?”	she	asked,	looking	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	saw	this	show	once,”	I	said,	“where	these	kids	were	upset	because	their parents	had	started	dating	after	the	divorce	or	death	or	whatever	it	was	that	had taken	place.	Maybe	Walker’s	upset	because	of	this	couple	thing	we’re	doing here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	we	should	split	up	to	look	for	him,”	Iris	said.	“I’ll	take	that	room	with all	the	computers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	do	you	want	me	to	look?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p193"></a>“Anywhere	but	there,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,”	I	said	to	myself	after	she	was	gone,	looking	around	the	empty	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	would	I	go	if	I	were	lost?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	found	Walker	in	the	room	with	all	the	dead	televisions.	I	heard	him	before	I saw	him.	He	was	making	this	mewling	noise.	I	followed	it	around	the	maze	of televisions.	I	ran	into	several	dead	ends	and	had	to	backtrack	before	I	finally found	him.	He	was	sitting	on	the	floor	in	front	of	a	big-screen	television	with	a broken	screen.	He	was	crying,	but	he	didn’t	stop	when	he	saw	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	you	are,”	I	said.	“We’ve	been	worried	sick	about	you.”	I	put	out	my arms,	but	he	just	looked	at	the	broken	television	and	kept	on	crying.	I	picked	him up	and	carried	him	back	to	the	lobby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	set	up	for	the	shot	again	by	the	time	I	made	it	back	there,	but	now everyone	was	on	a	coffee	break. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	about	time,”	the	woman	in	charge	said	as	I	put	Walker	back	in	his	chair.	“I was	beginning	to	worry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	was	I,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Another	hour	and	we	have	to	pay	the	crew	overtime,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	waited	for	Iris	to	come	back,	but	she	didn’t.	“Maybe	she’s	lost	too,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	I’ll	have	to	rescue	her	as	well.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	in	charge	looked	at	her	watch.	“Maybe	we	should	just	go	with	what we’ve	got.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walker	wouldn’t	stop	crying,	so	I	patted	him	on	the	head.	“You’re	okay,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	nothing	wrong	with	you.”	But	still	he	kept	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	the	camera	from	him	and	rewound	it	until	I	found	a	shot	of	Iris	and	me walking	across	the	lobby	together.	I	paused	it	and	held	the	camera	out	to	Walker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,”	I	said,	“there’s	your	mom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stopped	crying	and	took	the	camera.	He	put	it	in	his	lap	and	stared	down	at the	image. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p194"></a>“You	see?”	I	said.	“Everything’s	all	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">AND	ONCE	THE	AGENCY	got	Iris	and	me	work	as	mannequins	at	the downtown	mall.	One	of	the	department	stores	was	having	a	promotion	and wanted	live	people	modeling	clothes	in	a	display	window.	We	changed	into	their clothes,	and	the	man	in	charge,	Tiff,	walked	us	to	the	display.	“I	have	to	lock	the door	when	you’re	inside,”	he	said,	“on	account	of	store	regulations	and	all,	but I’ll	let	you	out	every	hour	for	a	washroom	break.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	want	us	to	do?”	I	asked	once	we	were	inside	the	display	case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	act	natural,”	Tiff	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	isn’t	exactly	a	natural	setting,”	I	told	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	I	mean	is	that	I	don’t	want	you	to	act	like	mannequins,”	he	said.	“I	want you	to	act	like	people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	do	that,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hope	so,”	he	said,	“because	that’s	why	we	hired	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	been	acting	like	a	person	all	my	life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	display	window	was	where	the	store	met	the	rest	of	the	mall.	The	inside	of	it was	set	up	like	a	living	room	and	kitchen.	There	was	a	couch,	a	television, chairs,	lamps,	a	stove	and	refrigerator,	the	whole	works.	It	was	all	from	the	store. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	the	kind	of	place	I	dreamed	about	living	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Iris	and	I	sat	on	the	couch	and	watched	a	DVD	on	the	television.	It	was	one	of those	expensive	DVD	players,	the	kind	that	held	six	discs,	so	we	could	have	sat there	and	watched	movies	for	the	entire	shift,	but	after	a	half	hour	or	so,	Tiff opened	the	door	to	the	case	and	told	us	we	had	to	be	more	dynamic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	what	you	mean,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Move	around,”	he	said.	“Use	all	the	products.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	got	up	and	went	over	to	the	fridge.	It	was	plugged	in	and	full	of	bottles	of water.	I	opened	one	and	drank	from	it.	Outside,	in	the	mall,	people	stopped	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p195"></a>look	at	us.	I	waved	at	them.	Tiff	pounded	on	the	glass	wall	of	the	display	and shook	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Iris	went	over	to	the	exercise	bike	in	the	corner	and	started	cycling.	She	was	still watching	the	movie.	I	took	a	water	bottle	over	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	doing?”	she	asked,	looking	at	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	bringing	you	water,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?”	she	asked,	looking	at	me	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	trying	to	pretend	like	we’re	a	couple,”	I	said.	“On	account	of	the	display and	all.”	I	leaned	in	and	kissed	her	on	the	cheek. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shook	her	head	but	took	the	water.	“I	need	to	find	another	job,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	the	best	job	I’ve	ever	had,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IRIS	AND	I	WORKED	as	mannequins	for	a	couple	of	weeks.	When	we	were	on break,	I	liked	to	stand	out	in	the	hallway,	looking	in	at	the	display	case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes	I	even	polished	the	window	with	paper	towel	and	glass	cleaner	I	got from	one	of	the	women	who	worked	the	perfume	counters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	few	days,	Iris	started	bringing	Walker	to	work.	She	parked	his	wheelchair in	front	of	the	display	case,	where	he	could	watch	us.	He	filmed	us	all	day	long with	his	digital	camera. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	one	of	our	breaks,	I	tried	talking	to	him.	Iris	was	off	in	the	washroom	or buying	food	or	something,	so	it	was	just	the	two	of	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How’s	it	going,	son?”	I	asked	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	the	camera	on	me	but	didn’t	say	anything.	The	one	eye	I	could	see was	closed	so	he	could	look	through	the	camera’s	viewfinder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	someday	we	can	take	you	in	there	with	us,”	I	said,	indicating	the display.	“Would	you	like	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	still	didn’t	say	anything,	just	kept	on	filming. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p196"></a>“All	right	then,”	I	said	and	looked	back	at	the	case.	Out	of	the	corner	of	my	eye, I	saw	him	turn	the	camera	back	on	it	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Iris	came	back,	she	asked	us	what	we	had	been	doing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	were	bonding,”	I	said,	and	Walker	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	MANNEQUIN	JOB	ENDED	for	us	when	I	lit	the	display	case	on	fire.	I’d brought	in	some	soup	and	I	was	heating	it	in	a	pot	on	the	stove	when	I	smelled something	burning.	I	lifted	the	pot	and	looked	underneath	but	there	was	nothing on	the	element. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	what	have	you	done?”	Iris	asked,	coming	over	from	where	she’d	been doing	jumping	jacks	in	the	middle	of	the	living	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	haven’t	done	anything,”	I	said.	But	when	I	turned	off	the	stove,	the	smell	grew even	stronger.	Then	Walker	rolled	his	wheelchair	over	until	he	was	directly	on the	other	side	of	the	glass	from	us,	and	he	pointed	behind	the	stove.	I	looked back	there.	The	curtains	that	were	framing	the	fake	window	over	the	stove	hung down	where	all	the	electrical	outlets	for	the	display	were,	and	the	bottom	part	of them	was	on	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	did	you	manage	that?”	Iris	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	do	it,”	I	said.	“It	must	be	some	sort	of	wiring	thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	we	should	put	it	out,”	Iris	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	threw	the	soup	on	the	curtains,	but	it	only	put	out	some	of	the	fire.	The	case was	beginning	to	grow	hazy	with	smoke	now,	and	the	people	who	had	been watching	Iris	do	jumping	jacks	started	to	back	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	what?”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	I	think	we	should	leave,”	Iris	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	when	we	went	to	the	door,	it	was	locked.	“Tiff!”	I	shouted,	banging	on	the door,	but	he	was	nowhere	in	sight.	The	only	people	from	the	store	I	could	see were	the	women	from	the	perfume	counter,	and	they	just	stayed	by	their	counter and	stared	at	us.	I	ran	to	the	phone	on	our	end	table,	picked	it	up,	and	dialed	911</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p197"></a>before	I	realized	there	was	no	dial	tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Iris	was	at	the	other	end	of	the	display	case,	shouting	to	Walker	through	the glass.	“Don’t	let	anyone	take	the	camera	away	from	you	if	we	die,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll	need	that	film	for	the	lawsuit.”	He	nodded	and	kept	filming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	the	curtains	were	totally	on	fire,	and	the	flames	had	spread	to	other	things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fake	window	frame	was	burning,	as	was	the	edge	of	the	carpet.	And	there was	a	thick	layer	of	smoke	at	the	top	of	the	case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	isn’t	there	a	fire	extinguisher	in	here?”	I	asked.	“Every	home	should	have a	fire	extinguisher.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Iris	ran	to	my	side.	“Have	you	got	any	ideas	how	to	get	us	out	of	this	mess?”	she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	should	lie	down,”	I	said.	“In	the	movies,	people	always	lie	down	to	get away	from	the	smoke.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	don’t	need	to	get	away	from	the	smoke,”	she	said,	“we	need	to	get	away from	here.	We	need	to	break	the	glass.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	I	said,	looking	at	the	large	windows.	The	display	case	was completely	ringed	by	people	watching	us	now.	“What	if	they	charge	us	for	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	my	God,”	Iris	said	and	ran	to	one	of	the	walls.	“Help!”	she	screamed, pounding	on	the	wall	and	waving	at	the	crowd.	“Someone	help	me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	saw	then	that	it	was	up	to	me.	I	went	over	to	the	television	and	picked	it	up.	It was	a	big-screen	model,	and	I	could	barely	lift	it.	I	staggered	over	to	the	wall that	Iris	was	pounding	on	and	threw	it	at	the	glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	wall	shattered	as	the	television	went	through	it,	and	large	pieces	of	glass	fell out	into	the	mall.	Some	people	in	the	crowd	screamed	and	ran	away,	but	others applauded.	Iris	pushed	past	me	and	jumped	to	the	floor,	then	ran	to	Walker.	I followed	her	but	only	made	it	about	halfway	before	I	collapsed	to	the	floor.	Now that	I	was	in	the	fresh	air	of	the	mall,	I	could	barely	breathe	-	all	I	could	do	was cough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	back	at	the	display	case	in	time	to	see	Tiff	rush	into	it	with	a	fire</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p198"></a>extinguisher.	Everything	was	burning	now	-	the	rug,	the	couch,	even	the	fake flowers	on	the	kitchen	table.	Tiff	sprayed	wildly	with	the	fire	extinguisher	for	a moment,	but	it	ran	out	of	foam	before	he’d	even	put	out	the	couch.	Then	his pants	caught	on	fire.	He	ran	out	of	the	display	case,	burning	and	screaming,	in the	direction	of	the	women	at	the	perfume	counter,	who	scattered	at	his approach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	that	was	all	I	saw,	because	then	I	was	rolling	over	and	throwing	up	on	the floor.	After	I	was	done	throwing	up,	I	passed	out.	At	least,	I	think	I	passed	out, because	the	next	thing	I	knew,	I	was	on	my	back	and	staring	at	the	sign	of	the Starbucks	across	the	hall,	while	people	from	the	crowd	kneeled	all	around	me.	I opened	my	mouth	to	speak	but	couldn’t	get	any	words	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Iris	was	at	my	side,	and	she	rested	her	hand	on	my	forehead.	“You’re	going	to	be all	right,”	she	said.	“I	think	someone’s	called	an	ambulance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	around	at	everyone	staring	down	at	me.	All	those	people	concerned about	me	-	I	almost	couldn’t	believe	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	whole	body	started	to	shake,	and	Iris	moved	her	hand	from	my	forehead	to my	chest,	pressing	me	down	to	the	mall	floor.	“You’re	going	to	be	all	right,”	she said	again,	but	I	couldn’t	stop	shaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walker	rolled	up	on	the	other	side	of	me.	For	a	moment	our	eyes	met,	even	as	I continued	shaking.	Then	he	held	out	the	camera	so	I	could	see	the	image	there.	It was	of	the	time	that	I’d	kissed	Iris	in	the	display	case,	before	the	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	okay,”	he	said.	“There’s	nothing	wrong	with	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	right,”	Iris	said.	“There’s	nothing	wrong	with	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	couldn’t	stop	shaking	but	I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Say	it,”	Iris	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	couldn’t	look	away	from	that	picture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Say	it,”	Iris	said	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	nothing	wrong	with	me,”	I	managed. </p>

You	must	include	a	copy	of,	or	the	Uniform	Resource	Identifier (URI)	for,	this	License	with	every	copy	of	the	Work	You	Distribute	or	Publicly Perform.	You	may	not	offer	or	impose	any	terms	on	the	Work	that	restrict	the terms	of	this	License	or	the	ability	of	the	recipient	of	the	Work	to	exercise	the rights	granted	to	that	recipient	under	the	terms	of	the	License.	You	may	not sublicense	the	Work.	You	must	keep	intact	all	notices	that	refer	to	this	License and	to	the	disclaimer	of	warranties	with	every	copy	of	the	Work	You	Distribute or	Publicly	Perform.	When	You	Distribute	or	Publicly	Perform	the	Work,	You may	not	impose	any	effective	technological	measures	on	the	Work	that	restrict the	ability	of	a	recipient	of	the	Work	from	You	to	exercise	the	rights	granted	to that	recipient	under	the	terms	of	the	License.	This	Section	4(a)	applies	to	the Work	as	incorporated	in	a	Collection,	but	this	does	not	require	the	Collection apart	from	the	Work	itself	to	be	made	subject	to	the	terms	of	this	License.	If	You create	a	Collection,	upon	notice	from	any	Licensor	You	must,	to	the	extent practicable,	remove	from	the	Collection	any	credit	as	required	by	Section	4(c), as	requested. </p>

The	credit required	by	this	Section	4(c)	may	be	implemented	in	any	reasonable	manner; provided,	however,	that	in	the	case	of	a	Collection,	at	a	minimum	such	credit</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p204"></a>will	appear,	if	a	credit	for	all	contributing	authors	of	Collection	appears,	then	as part	of	these	credits	and	in	a	manner	at	least	as	prominent	as	the	credits	for	the other	contributing	authors.	For	the	avoidance	of	doubt,	You	may	only	use	the credit	required	by	this	Section	for	the	purpose	of	attribution	in	the	manner	set	out above	and,	by	exercising	Your	rights	under	this	License,	You	may	not	implicitly or	explicitly	assert	or	imply	any	connection	with,	sponsorship	or	endorsement	by the	Original	Author,	Licensor	and/or	Attribution	Parties,	as	appropriate,	of	You or	Your	use	of	the	Work,	without	the	separate,	express	prior	written	permission of	the	Original	Author,	Licensor	and/or	Attribution	Parties. </p>
