<h2 id="calibre_toc_34" class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">Chapter 3</i>_3_</h2>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s get one thing straight, Carnie,” said Sylvia. “<i class="calibre2">I’m</i> in charge now. And you don’t kill anybody unless I tell you to.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, Ma’am.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jake and Cynthia were amazed at Carnie’s metamorphosis. She had gone from monster to mouse right before their eyes. Greg was still too dazed to notice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take these two and put them over there and handcuff them to beds.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We don’t have any more handcuffs,” said Carnie.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Borrow a couple from those women.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cynthia didn’t want Carnie to grab her, so she walked to the right side of her mother’s bed and stood.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, not there,” said Carnie. “Not by your mother.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It doesn’t matter, Carnie. Just cuff her,” said Sylvia.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jake helped Greg stand up and walked him to the left side of Betsy’s bed—the farthest distance from Cynthia. Greg leaned against the wall and slid to a sitting position on the floor. Jake handcuffed him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was stupid to leave the van in the barn,” said Sylvia.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was planning to dump it,” said Carnie.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, it’s too late for that. But it doesn’t matter now.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sylvia glanced at Cynthia and then at Greg. “I saw your car. Nice hiding place. In fact, I parked in that area too. By the way, I hope you have a good warranty on those tires.” She pulled out a large pocket knife and held it up, smiling.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Carnie stepped in close to her grandmother and whispered, “What’s the plan?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just be patient, My Dear. Now give me a proper greeting.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Carnie hated it—even in private. Now she was being forced to do it in front of other people. She kissed Sylvia on the lips.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But it was just a peck—not nearly enough to satisfy her grandmother. Sylvia took Carnie’s head in her hands and gave her an open-mouth kiss lasting five seconds.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the blink of an eye, Carnie could have unsheathed her knife and gouged out Sylvia’s tongue. And then her eyes. Then she could have cut out her heart and stomped on it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She <i class="calibre2">could</i> have.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2"> </i> *</p>
<p class="calibre1">Macy tossed and turned and thought about Elmo’s eyes and lips and arms. They had both wanted to make love. And they <i class="calibre2">would</i> have—if Carnie hadn’t interrupted. Of course, doing it on a hard floor was not what she had pictured for their first time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She had imagined it thousands of times—waiting naked on a warm bed, under a satin sheet, when he walked out of the steamy bathroom in his robe. They would eye each other with burning desire as he walked toward her. It would be all he could do to restrain himself from running to the bed and leaping on top of her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He would untie his robe and let it fall open, revealing his lean, muscular chest and his firm lower body, already throbbing for her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because Macy had not been with a man in many years, she had trained herself in the art of self-fulfillment. Through graphic visualizations, she could ring her own bell repeatedly—hands free.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But now she really needed to get some sleep. Tomorrow will be a wonderful day, she thought. She got up, put on her robe and went down to the kitchen for a glass of warm milk. When the microwave beeped, she reached to open to door.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why are you still up?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Macy spun around and saw Elmo, standing in the doorway wearing his robe and slippers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I couldn’t sleep,” she said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, me either.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m just so excited.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">He walked to her. “I love you, Macy.” He gave her a quick kiss. “Hey, since we’re both having trouble sleeping, you want to go down and watch a movie?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure.” She smiled. They had watched hundreds of movies and countless TV shows together. And now she could enjoy that with Elmo for the rest of their lives. As well as making love to him any hour of the day or night—any time he wanted her.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2"> </i> *</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who’s this?” said Sylvia to Carnie.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“His name is Jake. He’s a friend of mine.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“And he helped you set this up?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, ma’am.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cynthia interrupted. “Excuse me, but could somebody please tell me what’s going on here? Why have you kidnapped these women and drugged them? And why are you holding us?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sylvia turned to Cynthia. “Lady, I don’t think you understand the precarious situation you’ve gotten yourself into. I have total power over you and everybody in this room. For example: Carnie, go over there and slap Jake in the face. Slap him as hard as you can.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Carnie reluctantly followed her grandmother’s orders.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jake stared at Carnie, dumbfounded.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, that wasn’t good enough. You hesitated. Do it again. Now!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">This time, Jake grabbed Carnie’s hand before she could strike him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You failed, Carnie. Make him pull his pants down. Underwear too.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Forget it,” said Jake to Carnie. “I’m not playing this game.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, but you <i class="calibre2">are</i>, Jake,” said Sylvia. “Now, do what I said, Carnie.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Carnie reached for Jake’s belt bucket, but he pushed her away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay, that’s it,” said Sylvia. “End of game. Kill him, Carnie.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Carnie turned and gave her grandmother a stone cold stare.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kill him, now!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Carnie reached behind her back and pulled out the knife.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jake grabbed the pistol off the couch and pointed it at her. “What are you doing, Carnie? I love you. Put the knife away.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Love?” said Sylvia with a sneer. “Boy, you don’t even know what love is. Just because you got into her panties, you think she loves you? No. Carnie only loves one person and that’s me. Kill him!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Carnie moved toward Jake with demonic look in her eyes that freaked him out. He pulled the trigger. But it didn’t fire. Of course not, he thought. She had never loaded it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jake kicked Carnie back and she took a swipe at his leg and missed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do it!” said Sylvia.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It all happened too fast. The knife was in Carnie’s hand. She raised it above her head and then threw it at him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jake looked down and saw only the handle of the knife. The long blade was buried deeply in his chest. He slumped to the floor and fell over backwards.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Carnie went to his side. She looked as though she had just come out of a trance. “I’m sorry, Jake.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">But it was little consolation. If he’d done the right thing and turned himself in, he would have been wearing a one-piece prison suit.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But now he’d be wearing nothing but a toe tag.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2"> </i> *</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mallie Mae got up to go to the bathroom. Soon Elmo would know just how much his mother cared about him. She had disgraced herself at the restaurant for the sole purpose of keeping Carsie and Elmo apart. And bringing Macy and Elmo together. And she was proud of herself for doing it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But it had not been easy. We are trained as toddlers to only go in the potty. So, after more than 70 years, it took great effort for her to pee in her panties. And not just a little spurt. She needed enough to soak through her clothing and the fabric of the chair, so it would spill over and drip on the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But it had been well worth it. Elmo would now dump Carsie. He was in love with Macy, and always had been. Most of the time Macy and Elmo spent together had been late at night, after Mallie Mae had gone to sleep. She knew they enjoyed watching movies together, but she had never seen the possibility of romance. All three of them had been fools, she thought. But not anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When she came out of the bathroom she decided to check on Macy. She cracked her door and peeked out. Macy’s door was open and a faint light shone through her doorway. Mallie Mae couldn’t resist. She walked to Macy’s doorway and looked in.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Macy?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Macy was not in her bedroom or her bathroom. Maybe they’re watching a movie, she thought. Or maybe they’re <i class="calibre2">in his bed</i>.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She went downstairs and checked Elmo’s study and his bedroom. Both had their doors wide open. They must be in the Media Room, she thought. She tiptoed down the stairs, listening carefully as she went, and was nearly at the bottom of the stairs when she heard Elmo and Macy talking softly. She peeked out and saw them standing at the closed guest bedroom door—Carnie’s door. Bright light shone from the gap under the door.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you really think we should bother her? It’s 1:00 in the morning,” said Macy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, apparently she’s up. And I just want her to know we’re going to be watching a movie. Don’t want her to worry if she hears strange noises.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“And you want to apologize again,” said Macy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. Am I being silly?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No. I understand. I’ll apologize too.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Elmo knocked on the door and waited.</p>
<p class="calibre1">No answer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He tried again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wonder why she’s not answering?” said Macy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Carnie? You okay?” he said through the door.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Still no response.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now I’m getting worried,” he said to Macy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you have a key?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.” He rushed into the Pub Room and opened a cabinet behind the bar and pulled the key off the hook. Then he went back and opened Carnie’s door.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Macy looked at Elmo in shock. “What in the world is this?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mallie Mae gasped, and was surprised that neither Macy nor Elmo heard her and turned around. She knew this day would come.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But why did it have to come now?</p>
