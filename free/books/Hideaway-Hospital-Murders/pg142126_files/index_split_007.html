<h2 id="calibre_toc_7" class="calibre3">Chapter 6</h2>
<p class="calibre1">“Mom decided to take me up on my offer,” said Cynthia as she walked into the living room.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s moving in with you?” Greg had figured this was coming, but he didn’t think it would be this soon. It was Sunday night. Cynthia had just asked her mom the day before.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah. And she said she’d be ready to move next weekend. I’ll go over two or three nights this week and help her pack.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll go with you.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great. Thanks.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“She said she would line up a truck. Would you mind driving it?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No problem.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re wonderful.” She leaned over and gave him quick kiss.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He wanted it to be longer, but that could wait until later.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll make us some popcorn.” She walked into the kitchen.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay, Baby. I’ll get the movie ready.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Greg’s cell phone rang.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m glad you didn’t change your phone number.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Greg wished he had. It was his ex-wife. He had not spoken to her since right after the divorce. And they had been divorced for over five years. Before that, he had been a full-time minister of music. Her cheating and the subsequent divorce had put an end to that job. Fortunately, they never had children.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why are you calling me, Susan?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just wanted to see how you were doing. And I had a dream about you the other night. It was crazy. We were in bed together and—”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“—I don’t want to hear about it. And I’m busy right now. If you really need to talk, I’ll call you tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re with your girlfriend, aren’t you? That cute redheaded banker?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“How did you—”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“—I’ve got friends. They tell me things.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">He didn’t know his ex had any friends in town. He had moved from Longview to Coreyville to get away from her and her backstabbing friends. It was hard to believe that many of them had once been <i class="calibre2">his</i> friends too.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cynthia walked into the living room with the giant bowl of popcorn.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whatever. Look I’ve gotta go,” said Greg.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s right there, isn’t she? Are y’all in bed? Is she on top of you?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Goodbye!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your ex?” said Cynthia.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. Why did she have to ruin my night?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What did she want?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“To harass me.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, but that can’t be the only reason she called you after all this time.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Apparently, she has a friend in Coreyville who told her about us.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“So now she’s jealous?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe. But I don’t know why. Of course, she’s always wanted what she couldn’t have.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or maybe she just can’t stand to see you happy.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, just show her. Be happy.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cynthia gave him a warm, luscious kiss. It was short enough so they would still want to watch the movie, but long enough to make him forget about Susan.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2"> </i> *</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was only 9:00 PM, but Macy couldn’t wait any longer. She had to see what was going on in the Media Room. She prayed that Elmo and Carsie were just watching TV.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At 56, Dr. L.R. ‘Elmo’ Mobley was practically a virgin. He hadn’t had been with a woman in years. Macy had heard the full account from Mallie Mae years ago, when she first moved in to care for her after she broke her leg. Macy was her full-time nurse at first. But Mallie Mae enjoyed her company so much that she asked Macy to stay on, even after the leg had healed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When he was 37, Elmo had been giving every ounce of energy to his patients. But he finally grew tired of having no personal life. So he started dating. She was a nurse at Coreyville General Hospital—a very nice lady. And eventually the two set a wedding date. But Mallie Mae did not approve. And she did everything she could think of to destroy their relationship. But Elmo knew his mother was trying her best to break them up. So all <i class="calibre2">that</i> did was make him more determined to go through with his marriage plans.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then Mallie Mae crafted her most devious scheme ever. She paid off a sleazy private detective to produce porn pictures of Elmo’s fiancé. It was not that difficult to merge shots of her head with graphic sex pictures he found on the internet.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The doctor showed the photographs to his fiancé and she denied she had ever posed for such lurid pictures. He wanted so badly to believe her. But his mother had planted a terrible seed of doubt. And it grew like Dandelions—every time you pull one out of the ground to destroy it, you just scatter more seeds.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ultimately, the couple was doomed. He hated Mallie Mae for it. She had made him miserable while he was in medical school. Now she had destroyed his chance for love and happiness. He swore he would never forgive her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After that, whether consciously or not, he closed himself off to any possibility of a romantic relationship. Because Macy was aware of this, she had never pursued anything but a friendship. But sometimes it was all she could do to keep from telling him how she really felt.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, after so many years of loneliness, Carsie had bumped into him at the grocery store and stolen his heart. He had stopped by Kroger’s at lunchtime for a fix. Not many people knew he was addicted to Brach’s Candy Corn. Couldn’t be any other brand—had to be Brach’s. He kept a supply hidden in a desk drawer. So he went straight to the candy aisle and there she was—buying Brach’s Candy Corn. Supposedly, she was hooked on the stuff too. What were the chances of that?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Macy went downstairs to the basement and started to walk toward the open Media Room door. All she could hear was the TV. What if that woman already had him down on the floor? Macy had to admit that Carsie was hot. She could probably get him to do anything if she really tried.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Macy,” spoke a voice from the darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Macy jumped.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Easy, it’s just me—Carnie. I didn’t mean to startle you.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Carnie moved in closer and now Macy could see her—barely.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, you scared me to death. Don’t do that.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry. But I wanted to ask you something.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” Macy wondered why they needed to have this conversation in the dark. And couldn’t it wait until tomorrow?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Carnie moved in closer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” Macy asked again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Carnie grabbed her by the arms and kissed her on the lips.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Macy pulled back. “What are you doing?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just wanted to see if you were interested.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” As soon as she had said it, she regretted her mean tone. If Carnie was gay, she felt sorry for her. Macy couldn’t understand a woman wanting to be with another woman, but that was <i class="calibre2">thei</i>r business. She didn’t care. As long as they left <i class="calibre2">her</i> alone. “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No problem.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Carnie turned and disappeared into the darkness. Within minutes, she was in her car, driving toward Coreyville.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre2"> </i> *</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi. My name is Jake, and I couldn’t help but notice that nobody’s offered to buy the pretty lady a beer.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I already have a beer,” said Carnie.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I can see that. But you’re gonna finish that one off soon. So good ole Jake is here to buy you another one.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, really. Well, you can tell ‘good ole Jake’ that I don’t like drinking with guys who refer to themselves in third person.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Awe, come on. Have a drink with me.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine. Sit down. And take off your cowboy hat. Have some manners.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay. What’s your name, Honey?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well it’s not ‘Honey.’”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s Jennifer.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Glad to meet you, Jennifer. You’re not from around here, are you?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Carnie judged Jake to be about 6′2″, 220 pounds. She was only 5′6″, weighing in at 120, but she knew she could handle him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope. Just traveling through.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, what kind of work do you do?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m a nurse. Right now I’m in between jobs.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">He took a swig of his Budweiser.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, you like taking care of folks.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">She took care of them, all right. But they were sometimes in worse health after she took care of them. Sometimes dead. “You could say that.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“A man must <i class="calibre2">love</i> being married to a nurse.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wouldn’t know. Never asked. Never been married.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, that’s surprising. Especially considering how beautiful you are.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Normally, that line would have made Carnie want to stab the guy in the heart. But Jake actually sounded sincere. “Hey, you want to get out of here?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh…sure. Wanna go for a ride in my truck?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah. Let’s go.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jake took a dark narrow road and drove for a couple of miles. Carnie didn’t recognize the Country singer on the radio. But then, she hated Country music.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He turned onto a dirt trail that led to nowhere, parked and turned off the lights. They could see each other in the moonlight.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d just love to hold you in my arms,” he said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Really? Is that all you want to do? she thought.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He slid over, put his arm around her and started kissing her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s a good kisser, she thought. But she pushed him away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s the matter? I thought you wanted to make out?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, maybe I do and maybe I don’t. I’ll let you know.” Her hand was already in her skirt pocket. And <i class="calibre2">it</i> was in her hand. Just the flick of her thumb would pop up the razor blade—ready to perform the deadly deed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He backed away a little, and said, “Okay, whatever you want, Honey.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">He had done it again. He had called her ‘Honey.’ But this time she didn’t mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You wanna go back to the bar for a game of pool?” he said.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“And a couple more beers?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure. Let’s go.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">He started the truck.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Carnie liked this dumb cowboy. He was cute, and would take orders. He might just come in handy, she thought.</p>
<p class="calibre1">No need to kill him tonight.</p>
