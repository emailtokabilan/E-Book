    Confirmed worriers will worry about the weather, the past, the present,
the future, about work and about play, about food, clothing and drink,
about those who are present and those who are absent. Nothing escapes
them and they bring sadness and woe in their wake.</p>

<p id="id00191" class="calibre1">Worrying is slow suicide.</p>

<p id="id00192" class="calibre1">Elbert Hubbard says that our most serious troubles are those that never
happen.</p>

<p id="id00193" class="calibre1">Worrying is a very futile employment, for it never does any good, and it
reacts evilly upon the one who indulges in it, and those with whom he
associates. It is a waste of time and energy. The energy thus used could
be directed into useful channels.</p>

<p id="id00194" class="calibre1">Let those who are afflicted with this bad and annoying habit get into
good physical condition. Then many of the worries will take wing. If
they persist, it would be well to face the matter frankly and honestly,
setting down the advantages of worrying on one side and the
disadvantages on the other. Then take into consideration that not one
thing in a thousand worried about happens, and if something disagreeable
does occur, worrying can not prevent it. Besides a disagreeable
happening now and then will not cause half of the discomfort and trouble
that a disturbed mind does.</p>

<p id="id00195" class="calibre1">"And this too shall pass away," is an ancient saying which it would be
well to remember in conjunction with, "And this will probably never
happen."</p>

<p id="id00196" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Anger</i> is a form of temporary insanity. It is an emotion that is
unbecoming in strong men, for it is a sign of weakness, and the women
who indulge in it frequently can not long keep the respect of others.
Those who become angry lay themselves open to wounds of all kinds, for
they partly lose their mental and physical faculties temporarily. An
angry man is easily vanquished in any contest where ready wit is
necessary. As the saying is, he makes a fool of himself. To be high
strung and quick to lose one's temper may sound fine in romantic
rubbish, but in real life it is folly, for much more can be accomplished
by being calm.</p>

<p id="id00197" class="calibre1">Like hatred, anger produces poisons in the system. An angry mother's
milk has been known to kill the nursing child. A fit of anger is so
serious that the evil effects can be felt for several days, and those
who indulge in daily or even weekly loss of temper can not enjoy the
best of health, for the anger produces enough toxins to poison all the
fluids of the body.</p>

<p id="id00198" class="calibre1">Fortunately, anger is one of the emotions that can be conquered in a
reasonable time, if there is a real desire to do so. It should not take
an adult more than one or two years to get himself under control.</p>

<p id="id00199" class="calibre1">During anger there is a tensing of various muscles, those of the face
and hands for instance. If this tensing is not allowed the anger will
not last long. If there is a tendency to become angry, relax and the
mind will ease up. A perfectly relaxed individual can not harbor anger,
for this emotion requires tensing of body and mind. A determination to
control the temper and a whole-hearted apology after each display of
anger will prove very effective in reducing the frequency and force of
the attacks. Mental suggestion is not as powerful as some say, but it is
such a great force for good or evil, depending on its use, that those
who are wise will not neglect it as a means of self-conquest.</p>

<p id="id00200" class="calibre1">People who are easily offended and "stand on their dignity," have a very
poor footing. Those who find it necessary to inform others that they are
ladies or gentlemen, are very apt to be prejudiced in their own favor.
Gentlefolks do not need to advertise, nor do they do so. Others
recognize their worth intuitively.</p>

<p id="id00201" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Fretting</i> is anger on a small scale. It is a habit that is easily
formed. The fretter and those about him are made uncomfortable. Those
who respect themselves and others do not indulge.</p>

<p id="id00202" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Hatred</i> is one of the most harmful and poisonous of emotions.
Fortunately, violent hatred can last but a short time, otherwise it
would prove fatal. Some are chronic haters. He who hates harms himself.
The thoughts weave themselves into one's personality and form the
character.</p>

<p id="id00203" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Jealousy</i> is one of the most disagreeable of emotions. The jealous
person insists on suffering. A jealous woman can convert a home into an
inferno. Jealousy is sure to kill love in time. The jealous individual
often excuses himself on the ground that he loves. That is not true.
There is more fear than love at the base of jealousy. Jealous people are
selfish and too indolent mentally to give their thoughts a positive
direction.</p>

<p id="id00204" class="calibre1">Those who are violently jealous are suffering from mental aberration.
The jealous person loses, for he drives away the object of his
affection.</p>

<p id="id00205" class="calibre1">There are many jealous men, but women suffer most. Bad health and
idleness are two prolific causes of jealousy. It has probably broken up
more homes than any other one thing. It is blighting to all it touches.</p>

<p id="id00206" class="calibre1">Men and women may feel flattered for a time by producing jealousy, but
it is a satisfaction of very short duration. They soon grow weary of the
questions, doubts and reproaches.</p>

<p id="id00207" class="calibre1">Those who are sensible enough to give freely to others the liberty they
crave for themselves do not suffer much from this emotion. It would help
greatly if man and wife would look upon the marriage relation more as a
partnership and less as a form of bondage. One of the partners can not
force the other one to be "good." People do the best by others when full
confidence is given, and even if the confidence should be misplaced, it
would be better than to suffer from this corroding emotion at all times.</p>

<p id="id00208" class="calibre1">It is not an easy task to overcome jealousy, but it can be done within a
reasonable time if there is a real desire. First get physical health.
Then get busy with interesting, useful work. Get something worth while
to occupy the mind and the hands. Determine to be master of yourself and
not a slave to what is often but figments of the imagination.
Unfortunately, jealousy so dwarfs the judgment at times that the
sufferers seek only to rule or ruin. Love and hate are so closely akin
that it is hard to find the dividing line.</p>

<p id="id00209" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Sorrow</i>: Some dedicate their lives to a sorrow. They make martyrs of
themselves. They have suffered a loss and they dwell upon it during all
of their waking hours. It may be that it was a very ordinary or
worthless husband or child. After death the poor real is converted into
a glorious ideal. With the passing years the virtues of the departed
grow. All the love and tenderness are lavished upon the dead and the
living are neglected. It is generally women who suffer from this
peculiar form of mild insanity, but men are not exempt.</p>

<p id="id00210" class="calibre1">It is natural to feel the loss of a dear one, but so long as we are
mortal we must accept these things as matters of course.</p>

<p id="id00211" class="calibre1">Related to this form of sorrow is the regretting or brooding over past
actions, especially in connection with the dead. Perhaps something that
should have been done was neglected, or something was done that should
have been left undone. Over this the sufferer broods by the hour,
leading to a form of sad resignation that is rather irritating to normal
people.</p>

<p id="id00212" class="calibre1">For such people a change of interest and a change of scene will often
prove very beneficial.</p>

<p id="id00213" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Envy</i> and <i class="calibre7">spite</i> are closely akin to jealousy and anger. They have the
same effect in lesser degree.</p>

<p id="id00214" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Vacillation of mind</i> is a common fault. Many small questions have to be
settled and a few important ones. Some are in the habit of deferring
their decisions from time to time, or making and revoking their
decisions. Then they decide over again, after which there is another
revocation. This is repeated until it is absolutely necessary to make a
final decision. By this time the mind is so muddled that the chances are
that the last decision will be inferior to the first one. No one who
leads an active life can be right all the time. He who is right six
times out of ten does pretty well, and he who can make a correct
decision three times out of four can command a fine salary as an
executive or build up a flourishing business of his own, if his mind is
active.</p>

<p id="id00215" class="calibre1">The doubt and uncertainty which result from unsettled questions, which
should be promptly decided, are more harmful than an occasional error.
The untroubled mind works most quickly and truly.</p>

<p id="id00216" class="calibre1">Related to this in minor key is the doubtful condition of mind where the
individual has to do things several times before he is sure they are
properly done. For instance, there is the man who must try the office
door several times to be sure that it is locked and after being
satisfied on this point he is obliged to unlock it and investigate the
condition of the safe door. Then it is necessary to attend to the office
door two or three times again. This kind of doubtfulness takes many
forms. It does no special harm except that it leads to much waste of
time. Such people should teach themselves concentration, thinking about
one thing only at a time, until they learn that when a thing is done it
is properly done.</p>

<p id="id00217" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Judging</i>: Many insist on passing judgment on everything and everybody
that come to their notice. Every individual has to be placed with the
sheep or the goats. This is a great waste of time. Each one of us can
know so little about the majority of individuals we meet and of the vast
volume of knowledge that is to be had that if we try to judge everyone
and everything, our opinions become worthless. Wise people are never
afraid to say, "I don't know." If it is necessary to judge, let there be
kindness.</p>

<p id="id00218" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Volunteering advice</i>: This is another annoying habit. It is very well
to give advice if it is desired and asked for, otherwise it is a waste
of time. Take a person with a cold, for example: If he meets twenty
people he may be told of fifteen different cures for it, ranging from
goose grease on a red rag to suggestive therapeutics. If he were to act
upon all the advice received there would probably be a funeral. It is
best to be sparing with advice. Those who have any that is worth while
will be asked for it and paid for their trouble. Free advice is
generally worth what it costs.</p>

<p id="id00219" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Cranks</i>: Many allow themselves to get into a mental rut with their
thoughts running almost entirely to one subject. This is a mild form of
insanity, for normal people have many interests. These people are the
cranks. They can talk volumes about their favorite topic, often of no
importance. It may be some peculiar religion or ethics; or that Bacon
wrote the plays of Shakespeare; or some health fad, or almost any
subject.</p>

<p id="id00220" class="calibre1">Of all the cranks the diet crank is one of the most annoying, for he has
three good opportunities to air his views each day. With the best
meaning in the world he does more harm to the cause of food reform than
do the advocates of living in the good old way, eating, drinking and
being merry and dying young. When people become possessed of too much
zeal and enthusiasm regarding a subject, they are sure that their
knowledge is the truth and they insist upon trying to enforce their way
upon others, resent having their old habits interfered with forcibly.
Those who are too persistent and insistent produce antagonism and
prejudice in the minds of others, and then it is almost impossible to
impart the truth to them, for they will neither see nor hear.</p>

<p id="id00221" class="calibre1">To be able to influence others for better is a grand and glorious thing,
but it is well to remember that we can not force knowledge which is
contrary to popular thought upon others suddenly. Those who change a
well rooted opinion generally do so gradually. When they first hear the
truth, they say it is ridiculous. After a while they think there may be
something in it. At last they see its superiority over their former
opinions and accept it. It requires infinite patience on the part of the
educators to impart unpopular knowledge to other adults, no matter how
much truth it contains.</p>

<p id="id00222" class="calibre1">The truth about physical well-being is so simple and so self-evident
that it is exceptionally hard to get an unprejudiced audience. From the
time when the ancient heathen priests were the healers until today the
impression has been that health and healing are beyond the understanding
of the common mind, and therefore people are willing to be mystified.
The mysterious has such a strong appeal in this world of uncertainties
that it is more attractive than the simple truth. Mystery simply demands
faith. The truth compels thinking and thoughts are often painful.</p>

<p id="id00223" class="calibre1">By all means, avoid being overinsistent in trying to impart health
knowledge to others. All who have a little knowledge of the fundamentals
of health and growth know that useful men and women are going into
degeneration and premature death constantly, because of violated health
laws. If these people on the brink, who can yet be saved by natural
means, are told how it can be done, they generally either refuse to
believe it, or they have led such self-indulgent lives that it is beyond
their power to change. The knowledge often comes too late.</p>

<p id="id00224" class="calibre1">Those who are anxious to do good in the spreading of health knowledge
among their friends can serve best by getting health themselves. If a
physical wreck evolves into good health there will be considerable
comment and inquiry. This is the opportunity to tell what nature will do
and inform others where to obtain a good interpretation of nature's
workings.</p>

<p id="id00225" class="calibre1">A little practicing is worth more than a great deal of preaching. The
truth is the truth, no matter what the source, but it is more effective
if it comes from one who lives it.</p>

<p id="id00226" class="calibre1">I have gone into the subject of health cranks so deeply because there
are so many of them. They get a little knowledge and then they believe
they are masters of the subject. The right attitude toward proper
living, and especially toward proper eating is: "I shall try to conduct
myself so as to be healthy and efficient. If others desire my help, I
shall try to indicate the way to them. Right living is no sign of
superior goodness or merit, being a matter of higher selfishness, so I
deserve no credit for it. Although health is very important, I shall
refrain from attempting to force my will on others."</p>

<p id="id00227" class="calibre1">After conquering ourselves it is time to begin making foreign conquests,
but by that time the realization comes that in the end it is best to
leave others free to work out their own salvation. The desire is strong
to mould others according to our pattern, but those who size themselves
up honestly soon come to the conclusion that they are so imperfect that
perchance some other pattern is fully as good.</p>

<p id="id00228" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Postponing happiness</i>: One peculiar state of mind is to refuse to be
happy at present. The romantic girl and boy think they can not be happy
until they are married. After marriage they find that they have to gain
a certain amount of wealth before happiness comes. Then they have to
postpone it for social position. They continue postponing happiness from
time to time and the result is that they never attain it. Happiness is
not a great entity that bursts upon us, transforming us into radiant
beings. It is a comfortable feeling that brings peace and places us in
harmony with our surroundings. It can best be gained by doing well each
day the work that is to be done, cheerfully giving in return for what is
received. Happiness is largely a habit. It is as easy to be bright and
cheerful as it is to be sad and doleful, and much more comfortable. If
we look for the best we will find beauty even in the most unpromising
places. If we are looking for tears and woe, we can easily find them.</p>

<p id="id00229" class="calibre1">We can get along without happiness, but it adds so much color and beauty
to life, it makes us so much better, it helps us so much to be useful
that it is folly to do without it. It is not gained by narrow
selfishness. Those who forget themselves most and are kind and
considerate find it. By giving it to others we get it for ourselves.
Ecstasy and rapture are emotions of short duration. They are so
exhilarating that they soon wear out.</p>

<p id="id00230" class="calibre1">We all have our little troubles and annoyances. These we should accept
as inevitable, and neither think nor talk much about them. They help to
wear away the rough edges. We are stupid at times and so are others and
then mistakes are made. These should also be accepted as inevitable, and
we should not be more annoyed by those that others make than by our own.
Those who go into a rage when their subordinates err waste much time and
energy, erring gravely themselves.</p>

<p id="id00231" class="calibre1">It is not necessary to notice every unimportant detail that is not<br class="calibre12"/>

pleasing. Fault-finding, carping and nagging destroy harmony.<br class="calibre12"/>

Disagreements about trifles often lead to broken friendship and enmity.<br class="calibre12"/>

Most quarrels are about trifles.<br class="calibre12"/>
</p>

<p id="id00232" class="calibre1">If mistakes are made, learn the lesson they teach and then forget about
them. All live, active beings make mistakes. Sometimes we make serious
ones and afterwards regrets come, but these must soon be thrust aside.
Brooding has put many into the insane asylums.</p>

<p id="id00233" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Introspection</i>: It is not well to allow the mind to dwell upon one's
self very much. Give yourself enough thought to guide yourself through
life, and then for the rest apply the mind to work and play. Many of
those who are too self-centered end up in believing they are something
or somebody else and then they are shut away from the public.</p>

<p id="id00234" class="calibre1">Introspection is a very useless employment. Individually we are so
small, and the mind has such great possibilities, that if we center it
upon our tiny physical being, things become unbalanced and the mind
ceases to work to good advantage. It is useless to go deeply into
self-analysis, for we are very poor judges of ourselves. One of my
neighbors delved so deeply into his heart and tried so hard to find out
if he was fit to dwell in heaven that he lost his mind and had to be
confined for a long time. He allowed his vision to narrow down to one
subject. There are many subjects that lead to insanity if they are
allowed exclusive possession of the mind.</p>

<p id="id00235" class="calibre1">After we have given ourselves proper care, we should think no more about
ourselves. The best way is to get busy in work and play and forget
ourselves. It is much better to love others than to center our love upon
ourselves. If we conduct ourselves well we shall have all the love from
others that we need. If there is a tendency to be introspective, cure it
by becoming active mentally and physically.</p>

<p id="id00236" class="calibre1">Those who have acquired the bad habit of thinking and talking ill of
others should break themselves of it. First cease talking ill. Then
begin to look for the good points and mention them. By and by the
thoughts will be good. Those who lack a virtue can often cultivate it by
assuming it.</p>

<p id="id00237" class="calibre1">One of the most helpful things is a sense of humor. Laughter brings
about relaxation and relaxation gives ease of body and mind. He who can
see his own weaknesses and smile at them is surely safe and sane. If the
mind is too austere, cultivate a sense of humor. Train yourself to
appreciate the ridiculous appearance you make and instead of being
chagrined, smile. When others laugh at you, join them.</p>

<p id="id00238" class="calibre1">Whatever the mental ill may be, one-half of its cure will be brought
about by getting physical health.</p>

<p id="id00239" class="calibre1">Be charitable, tolerant and kind, and the good things in life will come
to you. Be slow to judge and slower still to condemn others.</p>

<p id="id00240" class="calibre1">Those who give love attract it. Hypatia said: "Express beauty in your
lives and beauty flows to you and through you. To love means to be
loved, and to put hate behind is the sum of all loving that is of any
avail."</p>

<p id="id00241" class="calibre1">The best "New Thought" is the best old thought. If we only would put
some of the beautiful knowledge into common use, what an agreeable
dwelling place this world would be. Marcus Aurelius gave us this pearl
of wisdom: "When you arise in the morning, think what a precious
privilege it is to live, to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love! God's
spirit is close to us when we love. Therefore it is better not to
resent, not to hate, not to fear. Equanimity and moderation are the
secrets of power and peace."</p>

<div class="calibre10"></div><div class="calibre10"></div><h2 id="id00242" class="calibre11">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h5 id="id00243" class="calibre5">FOOD.</h5>

<p id="id00244" class="calibre1">The human body is so wonderfully made that as yet we have only a poor
understanding of it, but we are learning a little each decade, and
perhaps in time we shall have a fair knowledge both of the body and of
the mind. Body and mind can not be considered as two separate entities,
for neither one is of any use without the other.</p>

<p id="id00245" class="calibre1">The body is not a machine. Those who look upon it as such make the
mistake of feeding it as they would an engine, thinking that it takes so
much fuel to keep going. The human organism is perhaps never quite alike
on any two consecutive days, for the body changes with our thoughts,
actions and environment, and the conditions never quite repeat
themselves and therefore we have to readjust ourselves.</p>

<p id="id00246" class="calibre1">The most important single item for gaining and retaining physical health
is proper feeding, yet the medical men of this country pay so little
attention to this subject that in some of our best equipped medical
colleges dietetics are not taught. A total of from sixteen to thirty
hours is considered sufficient to fit the future physicians to guide
their patients in the selection, combination and preparation of food.
Dietetics should be the principal subject of study. It should be
approached both from the scientific and from the empirical side. It is
not a rigid subject, but one which can be treated in a very elastic way.
The scientific part is important, but the practical part, which is the
art, is vastly more important. A part of the art of feeding and fasting
is scientific, for we get the same results every time, under given
conditions.</p>

<p id="id00247" class="calibre1">When we consider the fact that the body is made up of various tissues,
such as connective tissue, blood, nerves and muscles; that these in turn
are made up of billions of cells, as are the various glandular organs
and membranes; that these cells are constantly bathed in blood and
lymph, from which they select the food they need and throw the refuse
away, we must marvel that an organism so complex is so resistant, stable
and strong.</p>

<p id="id00248" class="calibre1">All articles of good quality are made by first-class workmen from fine
materials. However, many people fail to realize that in order to have
quality bodies they must take quality food, properly cooked or prepared,
in the right proportions and combinations. If we feed the body properly,
nature is kind enough to do good constructive work without any thought
on our part.</p>

<p id="id00249" class="calibre1">You will find no rigid rules in these talks on diet, but you will find
information that will enable you to select foods that will agree with
you. People may well disagree on what to eat, for there are so many
foods that a person could do without nine-tenths of them and still be
well nourished. In fact, we consume too great a variety of food for our
physical well-being. Great variety leads to overeating.</p>

<p id="id00250" class="calibre1">A healthy human body is composed of the following compounds, in about
the proportions given:</p>

<p id="id00251" class="calibre1">  Water, 60 to 65 per cent.<br class="calibre12"/>

  Mineral matter, 5 to 6 per cent.<br class="calibre12"/>

  Protein, 18 to 20 per cent.<br class="calibre12"/>

  Carbohydrates, 1 per cent.<br class="calibre12"/>

  Fat, 10 per cent. This is perhaps excessive.<br class="calibre12"/>
</p>

<p id="id00252" class="calibre1">These substances are very complex and well distributed throughout the
body. They are composed of about sixteen or seventeen elements, but a
pure element is very rarely found in the body, unless it be a foreign
substance, such as mercury or lead. About 70 per cent of the body is
oxygen, which is also the most abundant element of the earth. Then in
order of their weight come carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, calcium,
phosphorus, sulphur, sodium, chlorine, fluorine, potassium, iron,
magnesium and silicon.</p>

<p id="id00253" class="calibre1">Because it will be helpful in giving a better idea of the necessity for
proper feeding, I shall devote a few words to each of these elements.</p>

<p id="id00254" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Oxygen</i> is a colorless, tasteless, odorless gas, forming a large part
of the atmospheric air, of water, of the earth's crust and of our foods.
It is absolutely essential to life, for without oxygen there can be no
combustion in the animal tissues, and without combustion there can be no
life. The union of oxygen with fats, carbohydrates and proteins in the
body results in slow combustion, which produces heat and energy. Our
chief supply of oxygen comes directly from the air, but this is
supplemented by the intake in food and water.</p>

<p id="id00255" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Carbon</i> is the chief producer of energy within the body, being the
principal constituent of starches, sugars and fats. It is what we rely
on for internal heat, as well as for heating our dwellings, for the
essential part of coal is carbon. The carbonaceous substances are needed
in greater quantity than any other, but if they are taken pure, they
cause starvation more quickly than if no food were eaten. This has been
proved through experiments in feeding nothing but refined sugar, which
is practically pure carbon. Salts and nitrogenous foods are essential to
life.</p>

<p id="id00256" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Hydrogen</i> is a very light gas, without odor, taste or color. It is a
necessary constituent of all growing, living things. It is plentifully
supplied in water. All acids contain hydrogen and so does the protoplasm
of the body.</p>

<p id="id00257" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Nitrogen</i> is also a colorless, tasteless, odorless gas. It is an
essential constituent of the body, being present in all compounds of
protein. It is abundant in the atmospheric air, from which it is taken
by plants. We get our supply either directly from vegetable foods or
from animal products, such as milk, eggs and meat.</p>

<p id="id00258" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Calcium</i> is needed principally for the bones and for the teeth, but it
is also necessary in the blood, where it assists in coagulation. We get
sufficient calcium salts in fruits, grains and vegetables, provided they
are properly prepared. The conventional preparation of the food often
results in the loss of the various salts, which causes tissue
degeneration. If the supply of calcium in the food is too small, the
bones and the teeth suffer, for the blood removes the calcium from these
structures. Growing children need more calcium proportionately than do
adults. This is without doubt the reason pregnant women suffer so much
from softening of the teeth. They are fed on foods robbed of their
calcium, such as white bread and vegetables that have been drained.</p>

<p id="id00259" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Phosphorus</i> in some forms is a poison whether taken in solid compounds
or inhaled in fumes, producing phossy jaw. In other forms it is
indispensable for bodily development. The compounds of phosphorus are
present in fats, bones and protein. In natural foods they are abundantly
present, but when these foods are unduly refined, or are soaked in water
which is thrown away, much of the phosphorus is lost. We get phosphorus
from milk, eggs, cereals, legumes and other foods. Of course, there is
phosphorus in fish, but those who eat sea food to make themselves brainy
will probably be disappointed. Phosphates are necessary for brain
development, but those who eat natural foods never need to go to the
trouble of taking special foods for the brain. If the rest of the body
is well nourished, the brain will have sufficient food, and if the body
is poorly nourished the brain will suffer.</p>

<p id="id00260" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Sulphur</i> is present in protein and we get a sufficient supply from
milk, meat and legumes. The element sulphur is quite inert and harmless,
but some of its acids and salts are very poisonous. Sulphur dioxide is
freely used in the process of drying fruits, as a bleacher. In this form
it is poisonous, and for that reason it would be well to avoid bleached
dried fruits. We need some sulphur, but not in the form of sulphur
dioxide or concentrated sulphurous acid, both of which are used in the
manufacture of food.</p>

<p id="id00261" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Sodium</i>, in its elementary state, which is not found in nature, is a
white, silvery metal. It is found in great abundance in the succulent
vegetables, and is present in practically all foods. As sodium chloride,
or common table salt, it is taken in great quantities by most people.
Those who have no salt get along well without it, which shows that it is
not needed in large amounts. If but a little is added to the food, it
does no perceptible harm, but when sprinkled on everything that is
eaten, from watermelons to meat, it is without doubt harmful. By soaking
foods, they are deprived of much of their soda: The two sodium salts
that are very abundant are sodium chloride, or common salt, and sodium
carbonate, generally called soda.</p>

<p id="id00262" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Chlorine</i> is ordinarily combined in our foods with sodium or potash,
forming the chlorides. It is essential to life. He who gets enough
sodium also gets enough chlorine. In its elementary form it is an
irritating gas, used for bleaching purposes.</p>

<p id="id00263" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Fluorine</i> is present in small quantities in the body, appearing as
fluorides in the bones and teeth. It is supplied by the various foods.
In its elementary form it is a poisonous gas.</p>

<p id="id00264" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Potassium</i> is found in the body in very small quantities, but it is
very important. It is mostly in the form of potassium phosphate in the
muscles and in the blood. It is necessary for muscular activity. It is
found in most foods in greater abundance than is sodium, which indicates
that it plays an important part in development. Like sodium, it is
easily dissolved out of foods which are soaked in water, and this is one
of the reasons that vegetables should not be soaked and the water thrown
away. It is very peculiar in its metallic state, being a silvery metal,
very light in weight, which burns when thrown upon water. That is, it
decomposes both itself and the water with the liberation of so much heat
that it fires the escaping hydrogen, which burns with a violet flame.
Pure potassium is not found in nature.</p>

<p id="id00265" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Iron</i> is found in very small quantities in the human body, but it is
absolutely essential to life. Animals deprived of iron die in a few
weeks, and people will do the same under similar circumstances. Iron is
obtained principally from fruits and vegetables, but it is also present
in other foods. Man can not make use of inorganic iron. He has to get
his supply from the vegetable and animal kingdoms. The giving of
inorganic iron is folly and helps to ruin the teeth and the stomach of
the one who takes it. In the form of hemoglobin this element is the
chief agent in carrying oxygen from the lungs to the tissues of the
body. In the manufacture of foods, much of the iron is lost. For
instance, whole wheat flour contains about ten times as much iron as
does the white flour. Too little iron causes, among other ills, anemia,
and if the iron is very low, chlorosis or the green sickness may ensue.</p>

<p id="id00266" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Magnesium</i> is found principally as phosphate in the bones. It is
present both in animal and vegetable foods. Its function in the body is
not well understood, but it appears to assist the phosphorus.</p>

<p id="id00267" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Silicon</i> is found in traces in the human body. It is supplied in small
quantities in nearly all of our foods, and therefore we must take it for
granted that it is necessary, although we are in the dark as to its
uses. It is very abundant in various rocks. The cereals are especially
rich in silicon. In wheat it is found in the bran and is removed from
the white flour.</p>

<p id="id00268" class="calibre1">The elements mentioned are the most important in the body, though others
are found in traces. We do not find the elements present as elements,
but in the form of very complex compounds. Under our present conditions
of living, we generally partake of too much carbonaceous and nitrogenous
food, and get too little of the salts, except sodium chloride, which is
taken in too great quantity. Salt, to most people, means but one thing,
sodium chloride or table salt. However, there are thousands of salts,
and when salts are mentioned in this book, all those necessary for the
processes of life are meant, whether they be compounds of fluorine,
sulphur, phosphorus, calcium, iron or magnesium or other metals and
minerals.</p>

<p id="id00269" class="calibre1">Salts are not usually classified as foods, but they are essential to
life. Supply the body with all the protein, sugar, starch and fat that
it requires, but withhold the salts, and it is but a question of a few
weeks before life ceases. This is why it is so important to improve our
methods of cooking. A potato that is peeled, soaked in cold water and
boiled, may lose as much as one-half of its salts, according to one of
the bulletins sent out by the U. S. Department of Agriculture. Other
vegetables not only lose their salts by such treatment, but as high as
30 per cent of their nutritive value.</p>

<p id="id00270" class="calibre1">The lesson we should learn from this is that ordinarily if it is
necessary to soak foods, such as beans, they should be cooked in the
water in which they have been soaked. Furthermore, where possible, as it
is with nearly all succulent vegetables, we should take the fluid in
which the vegetables have been cooked as a part of the meal. If the
vegetables are properly cooked, there will not be much fluid to take. To
pour away the water in which vegetables have been cooked means that
perhaps one-third of the food value and one-third to one-half of the
valuable salts are lost. Why continue impoverishing foods in this way?</p>

<p id="id00271" class="calibre1">Dr. Charles Page deserves much credit for calling our attention to this
fact when most healers neither thought nor talked about it. Now all
up-to-date healers with a knowledge of dietetics realize how important
it is to give good food. For those who wish more detailed information on
the composition of the salts, I insert a table which was compiled by
Otto Carque and published in "Brain and Brawn," February, 1913. Those
who wish still more detailed knowledge can find it in volumes on food
analysis and in some government reports.</p>

<p id="id00273" class="calibre13">Please remember that most of the salts must be worked into organic form
for us by vegetation, and that we are able to take but few elements that
have not been thus elaborated.</p>

<p id="id00274" class="calibre1">We need a moderate amount of food to maintain the body in health, but we
should be careful not to overindulge.</p>

<p id="id00275" class="calibre1">Perhaps the most injurious errors are made by people who eat because
they wish to gain in weight. They consider themselves below weight and
they try to force a gain by overeating. This is a serious mistake and
leads to much suffering.</p>

<p id="id00276" class="calibre1">There is no weight that can be called ideal for all people. To get a
basis, I copy a table from the literature of an insurance company. This
is for people twenty years old:</p>

<p id="id00277" class="calibre1">  Height     Weight<br class="calibre12"/>

    5—0……..114<br class="calibre12"/>

       1……..117<br class="calibre12"/>

       2……..121<br class="calibre12"/>

       3……..124<br class="calibre12"/>

       4……..128<br class="calibre12"/>

       5……..132<br class="calibre12"/>

       1……..167<br class="calibre12"/>

       2……..172<br class="calibre12"/>

       3……..177<br class="calibre12"/>
</p>

<p id="id00278" class="calibre1">If the weight is much above this, it is a sure sign that the individual
is building disease. It may be Bright's disease, fatty heart,
arteriosclerosis, cancer or any other ill. The muscles can not be
increased in size very much by eating and there is a limit to the amount
of fluid that can be stored away. Stout people generally carry about a
great amount of fat.</p>

<p id="id00279" class="calibre1">Excess of fat is a burden. It replaces other tissues and weakens the
muscles. It overcrowds the abdominal and thoracic cavities, thus making
the breath short and the working of the heart more difficult, also
producing a tendency to prolapsus of the various abdominal organs.</p>

<p id="id00280" class="calibre1">People make the mistake of thinking that stoutness indicates health. It
indicates disease. Going into weight is going into degeneration. Women
like to be plump for various reasons, some of which are not the most
creditable to either men or women. Fat people are not good looking.
There is not a statue in the world sculptured on corpulent lines that is
considered beautiful.</p>

<p id="id00281" class="calibre1">It is natural for some people to be slender and for others to be rather
plump, but fatness is abnormal. Rolling double chins and protruding
abdomens are signs of self-abuse in eating and drinking. As a rule women
are at their right weight at twenty and men at twenty-two or
twenty-three. This weight they should retain. If twenty or thirty pounds
are added to it life will be materially shortened.</p>

<p id="id00282" class="calibre1">Perfect health is impossible for obese people, but it is within the
reach of lean ones. In getting well, it is often necessary to become
quite slender, but after the system has cleansed itself, it gains in
weight again. It may take from several months to several years to obtain
a normal weight after the ravages of disease. A healthy body is
self-regulating and will be as heavy as it ought to be.</p>

<p id="id00283" class="calibre1">Those who eat too much in order to gain weight sometimes wreck their
digestive and assimilative powers to such an extent that they lose a
great deal of weight, and the more they eat the more they lose. Then it
is necessary to reduce the food intake until digestion and assimilation
catch up with supply. Then if the eating is right the individual goes to
the proper weight and retains it.</p>

<p id="id00284" class="calibre1">The slender people are in the safest physical condition. The vast amount
of statistics gathered by the life insurance companies bears this out.
Remember that fat is a low grade tissue, which sometimes crowds out high
grade tissue, that an excess indicates degeneration and that obesity is
a disease. All fat people eat too much, even though they consider
themselves small eaters. They should regulate their eating and drinking
so that they will return to a normal weight. This is the only safe way
to reduce.</p>

<p id="id00285" class="calibre1">Pay no attention to underweight. Eat what the body requires and is able
to digest and assimilate, without causing any inconvenience. The
organism will take care of the rest. To attempt to force weight onto a
body at the expense of discomfort, disease, reduced efficiency and
premature death shows poor judgment.</p>

<p id="id00286" class="calibre1">Losing weight does not matter at all if there is no discomfort or
disease. It is all right to be a little lighter during summer than in
winter.</p>

<p id="id00287" class="calibre1">In discussing food and its use, two words are frequently employed,
digestion and fermentation. Strictly speaking, digestion is largely a
process of fermentation, consisting of the breaking down of complex
substances into simple ones, by means of ferments. However, in the
popular mind digestion and fermentation are not synonymous, and will not
be so considered in this book. To make my meaning clear, in this book
the words will have the following meaning:</p>

<p id="id00288" class="calibre1">Digestion—the normal breaking down of food and formation into
substances that can be used by the blood for building, repairing and
producing heat and energy.</p>

<p id="id00289" class="calibre1">Fermentation—the abnormal breaking down of food in the digestive tract,
producing discomfort and health impaired. This process manifests in
various ways, such as the production of much gas in the digestive tract
or hyperacidity of the body.</p>

<p id="id00290" class="calibre1">We will consider digestion as a process conducive to health, but
fermentation, as one that leads to disease, being an early stage of
digestive derangement.</p>

<div class="calibre10"></div><div class="calibre10"></div><h2 id="id00291" class="calibre11">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h5 id="id00292" class="calibre5">OVEREATING.</h5>

<p id="id00293" class="calibre1">All agree that excessive indulgence in alcoholics is harmful physically,
mentally and morally. We condemn the too free use of tea and coffee and
nearly all other excesses. However, intemperate eating is considered
respectable. A large part of our social life consists in partaking of
too much food.</p>

<p id="id00294" class="calibre1">Medical text-books say that we must eat great quantities of food to
maintain strength and health. Humanity views the subject of eating from
the wrong angle, and it will perhaps be many years before the majority
gets the right point of view. We should eat to live, but most of us eat
to die. Benjamin Franklin said that we dig our graves with our teeth.</p>

<p id="id00295" class="calibre1">Men and women band themselves into societies and associations for the
purpose of decreasing or doing away with the use of tobacco and
alcoholic drinks. They advocate temperance and even abstinence in the
use of those things which do not appeal to their own senses; but most of
them are far from temperate in their eating. They have very keen vision
when searching for weaknesses and faults in others, but are quite
near-sighted regarding their own.</p>

<p id="id00296" class="calibre1">Is excessive indulgence in liquor any worse than overeating? Not
according to nature's answer. The inebriate deteriorates and so does the
glutton. Both cause race deterioration. Gluttony is more common than
inebriety and is responsible for more ills. Gluttony is often the cause
of the tea, coffee, alcohol and drug habits. Overeating often causes so
much irritation that food does not satisfy the cravings, and then drugs
are used.</p>

<p id="id00297" class="calibre1">Improper eating, chiefly overeating, causes most of the ills to which
man is heir. If people would learn to be moderate in all things disease
and early death would be very rare.</p>

<p id="id00298" class="calibre1">It is quite important to combine foods properly, but the worst
combinations of food eaten in moderation are harmless, as compared to
the damage done by overeating of the best foods. Overeating is with us
from the cradle to the grave. It shortens our days and fills them with
woe.</p>

<p id="id00299" class="calibre1">There is a hoary belief that a pregnant woman must eat for two. The
mothers have generally obeyed this dictum. The result is that women
suffer greatly during pregnancy and at childbirth. The morning sickness,
the aching back, the headache, the swollen legs and all of the
discomforts and diseases from which civilized woman suffers during this
period are mostly due to improper eating. Pregnancy and childbirth are
physiologic and are devoid of any great amount of discomfort, pain or
danger when women lead normal lives.</p>

<p id="id00300" class="calibre1">The overeating affects both mother and child. The mothers are often
injured or lose their lives during childbirth. Sometimes labor is so
protracted that the child dies and at other times the baby is so large
that it can not be born naturally. The mother's suffering is frequently
very great. In fact, it is at times so great that it is like a
threatening storm cloud to many women, and some of them refuse to become
mothers for this reason.</p>

<p id="id00301" class="calibre1">Babies born of normal mothers, who have lived moderately on a
non-stimulating diet during gestation, are small. They rarely weigh more
than six pounds. Their bones are flexible. The skull can easily be
moulded because the bones are very cartilaginous. The result is that
childbirth is rapid and practically devoid of pain. However, there are
very few normal mothers, and consequently normal babies are also rare.</p>

<p id="id00302" class="calibre1">A heavy baby is never healthy. Its growth has been forced by excessive
maternal feeding. It is no hardier than other growing things which
result from hot-house methods. Such babies show early signs of catarrhal
afflictions, indigestion or skin disease. Their bodies are filled with
poisons before they are born.</p>

<p id="id00303" class="calibre1">Mothers who overeat invariably overfeed their babies. And why should
they do otherwise? Family, friends and physicians give the same advice:
The mother must eat much to be able to feed the child, and the child
must be fed frequently in order to grow. It sounds very plausible, but
it does not work well in practice.</p>

<p id="id00304" class="calibre1">Why are babies cross? Why do they soon show catarrhal symptoms? Why do
they vomit so much? Why are they so subject to stomach and intestinal
disorders? Why do they have skin eruptions? Because they are overfed.</p>

<p id="id00305" class="calibre1">The diseases of babies are almost entirely of digestive origin, and in
nearly every instance overfeeding is the cause. Statistics show that
about one-fifth of the babies born die before they are one year old. In
nearly every instance the parents are to blame. One's intentions may be
good, but good intentions coupled with wrong actions are deadly to
infants. Oscar Wilde wrote, "We kill the thing we love." Parental love
too often takes the form of indulging them and so it happens that
hundreds of thousands of little ones are placed in their coffins
annually through love.</p>

<p id="id00306" class="calibre1">Each year about 280,000 babies under one year of age perish in the
United States, according to estimates based on census figures. Outside
of accidental deaths, which are but a small per cent., the mortality
should be practically nil. It is natural for children to be well, and
healthy children do not die.  If an army of about 280,000 of our men and
women were to perish in a spectacular manner each year it would cause
such sorrow and indignation that a remedy would soon be found. But we
are so accustomed to the procession of little caskets to the grave that
it hardly arouses comment. It costs too much in every way to produce
life to waste it so lavishly.</p>

<p id="id00307" class="calibre1">Why do little children suffer so much from eruptive diseases, whooping
cough, tonsilitis, adenoids, diphtheria and numerous other diseases?
Because they are overfed. The younger the child the greater is the per
cent. of disease due to wrong feeding. In adult life overeating and
eating improperly otherwise are still the principal causes of disease.
But during adult life the causation of disease is more complex than in
childhood, for the senses have been more fully developed and instead of
confining our physical sins to overeating we fall prey to the abuse of
various appetites and passions.</p>

<p id="id00308" class="calibre1">Vigorous adults are often the victims of pneumonia, typhoid fever and
tuberculosis. Overeating is chiefly to blame, not the bacteria which are
given as the principal cause.</p>

<p id="id00309" class="calibre1">Rheumatism, kidney disease and diseases that manifest in hardening of
the various tissues, all being forms of degeneration, are quite common.
Again, the principal cause is overeating.</p>

<p id="id00310" class="calibre1">There are a great number of people who live many years without any
special disease, but who are always on the brink of being ill. They are
full-blooded and too corpulent. Although they are often considered
successful, they are never fully efficient either physically or
mentally. They do not know what good health is, but they are so
accustomed to their state of toleration that they consider themselves
healthy. They are rather proud of their stoutness and their friends
mistake their precarious condition for health. These people often die
suddenly, and friends and acquaintances are very much surprised. No
healthy man dies suddenly and unexpectedly except by accident.</p>

<p id="id00311" class="calibre1">Instead of growing old gracefully, in possession of our senses and
faculties, we die prematurely or go into physical and mental decay.
Bleary eyes, pettiness, childishness and lost mental faculties are no
part of nature's plan for advanced years. Those manifestations result
from man's improvement on nature!</p>

<p id="id00312" class="calibre1">From birth to death we are victims of this terrible ogre of overeating.
It deprives us of friends and relatives. It takes away our strength and
health. It makes us mentally inefficient and cowardly. At last it
deprives us of life when our work is not half done and our days should
not be half run.</p>

<p id="id00313" class="calibre1">How is it possible, you may ask, that this is true? Of course,
overeating is not the only cause, but it is the overwhelming one. It is
the basic cause. Aided by other bad habits it conquers us. We are what
we are because of our parentage, plus what we eat, drink, breathe and
think, and the eating largely influences the other factors of life.</p>

<p id="id00314" class="calibre1">Cholera infantum causes the death of many babies. It never occurs in
babies who are fed moderately on natural, clean food, not to exceed
three or four times a day. The child is cross. The mother thinks that it
is cross because it is hungry and accordingly feeds. The real cause of
the irritability is the overfeeding that has already taken place. The
baby has had so much milk that it is unable to digest all of it. A part
of the milk spoils in the digestive tract. This fermented material is
partly absorbed and irritates the whole system. A part of it remains in
the alimentary tract where it acts as a direct local irritant to the
intestines. When these are irritated, the blood-vessels begin to pour
out their serum to soothe the bowels and the result is diarrhea. The
sick child is fed often. Digestive power is practically absent. The
additional food given ferments and more serum has to be thrown out to
protect the intestinal walls. Soon there is a well established case of
cholera infantum.</p>

<p id="id00315" class="calibre1">If only enough food had been given to satisfy bodily requirements, none
of the milk would have spoiled in the alimentary tract. If all feeding
had been stopped as soon as the child became irritable and pinched
looking about the mouth and nose, and all the water desired had been
given and the child kept warm, there would have been no serious disease.
In these cases, the less food given the quicker the recoveries and the
fewer the fatalities.</p>

<p id="id00316" class="calibre1">Another common disease of childhood is adenoids. To talk of these
maladies as diseases is rather misleading, for they are merely symptoms
of perverted nutrition, but we are compelled to make the best of our
medical language.</p>

<p id="id00317" class="calibre1">Adenoids are due to indigestion. The indigestion is due to overeating.
This is how it comes about: A child eats more than can be digested,
generally bolting the food, which is often of a mushy character. The
excessive amount of food can not be digested, and as the intestines and
the stomach are moist and have a temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit,
fermentation soon takes place. Some of the results of fermentation in
the alimentary tract are acids, gases and bacterial poisons. These
deleterious substances are absorbed into the blood stream and go to all
parts of the body, acting as irritants. We do not know why they cause
adenoids in one child and catarrh in another. It is easy enough to say
that children are predisposed that way, which is no information at all.
It seems that all of us have some weak point, and here disease has a
tendency to localize. What part the sympathetic nervous system plays, we
do not know. Glandular tissue is rather unstable and therefore it
becomes diseased easily and adenoids are therefore quite frequent.</p>

<p id="id00318" class="calibre1">A coated tongue, or an irritated tongue, both due to indigestion, is a
concomitant of adenoids. Such diseases do not merely happen. There are
good reasons for their appearance. They are not reflections on the
child, but they are on the parents who should have the right knowledge
and should take time and pains enough to educate and train the child
into health.</p>

<p id="id00319" class="calibre1">Tuberculosis is one of the results of ruined nutrition. First there is
overeating. This causes indigestion. The irritating products of food
fermenting in the alimentary tract are taken up by the blood. The blood
goes to the lungs where it irritates the delicate mucous membrane. In
self-protection it begins to secrete an excess of mucus and if the
irritation is great enough, pus. The various bacteria are incidental.
The tubercular bacillus is never able to gain a foothold in healthy
lungs, but after degeneration of lung-tissue has taken place the lungs
furnish a splendid home for this bacillus. The tubercular bacillus is a
scavenger and therefore does not thrive in healthy bodies. It is the
result of disease, not the cause.</p>

<p id="id00320" class="calibre1">Tubercular subjects never have healthy digestive organs. Unfortunately,
nearly all of them are persuaded to eat many times more food than they
can digest, and thus they have no opportunity to recover, for the
overfeeding ruins the digestive and assimilative powers beyond
recuperative ability. A large per cent. of the human race perish
miserably from this disease, which results principally from the
ingestion of too much food. The liberal use of such devitalized foods as
sterilized milk, refined sugar and finely bolted wheat flour is
doubtless a great factor in so reducing bodily resistance that the
system falls an easy prey to disease. Too little breathing and poor,
devitalized air are also important factors.</p>

<p id="id00321" class="calibre1">There are many causes of rheumatism, but overeating is the chief and it
is very doubtful if a case of rheumatism can develop without this main
cause. Exposure is often given as the cause, but a healthy man with a
clean body does not become rheumatic.</p>

<p id="id00322" class="calibre1">Rheumatism is due to internal filth. A filthy alimentary tract makes
filthy blood. Some say that the poison in rheumatism is uric acid, and
perhaps it is, but there are no uric acid deposits in the body of a
prudent eater. The elimination in this disease is imperfect. The skin,
the kidneys, the bowels and the lungs do not throw out the debris as
they should. Perhaps only one or two of these organs are acting
inadequately. The debris is stored up in the system.</p>

<p id="id00323" class="calibre1">Why do the organs of elimination fail to act? Because so much work is
thrust upon them that they grow weary and worn; also, a part of the
material furnished them is the product of decay in the alimentary tract,
and they can not thrive on poor material. Too much food is eaten. An
excess of nutritive material, poorly digested, is absorbed. And so we
come back to the principal cause, overeating.</p>

<p id="id00324" class="calibre1">When the eliminative organs fail to perform their function, the waste is
deposited in those parts of the body which are weakened. The irritation
from these foreign substances causes inflammation and the result is
pain. The extent to which this depositing of material will go is well
illustrated in some cases of multiple articular rheumatism, or arthritis
deformans, where the deposits are so great that many of the joints
become fixed (anchylosed).</p>

<p id="id00325" class="calibre1">We could review all the diseases, and nearly every time we would come
back to disturbed nutrition as the principal factor, and this is true of
not only physical ills, but the mental ones as well.</p>

<p id="id00326" class="calibre1">Various foods do not combine well, still if they are eaten in moderation
they do but little harm. If we overeat, the evil results are bound to
manifest, no matter how good the food, though it sometimes takes years
before they are perceptible. The effects are cumulative. Each day there
is a little fermentation with absorption of the poisonous products. Each
day the body degenerates a little. The time always comes when the body
can continue its work no longer, and then the individual must choose
between reform on one hand and suffering or death on the other.</p>

<p id="id00327" class="calibre1">It is very difficult to convince people that they eat too much. Indeed,
the average person is a small eater, in his own estimation. We have been
educated into consuming such vast quantities of food that we hardly know
what moderation is. In the past, physiologists and observers have
watched the amount of food that people could coax down and this they
have called the normal amount of food. This is far from the truth. The
average American eats at least two times as much as he can digest,
assimilate and use to advantage. Many eat three and four times too much.
However, nature is very tolerant for a while. Most of us start out with
a fair amount of resistance and are thus enabled to live to the age of
forty or fifty in spite of abuses. If we could only dispense with our
excesses, we could double or treble our life span, live better, get more
enjoyment out of life and give the world more and better work than we
can under present conditions.</p>

<p id="id00328" class="calibre1">There is much talk of food shortage. The amount of food consumed and
wasted annually in the United States is enough to feed 200,000,000
people. Even with our present knowledge we can easily produce twice as
much per acre as we are averaging, and we are tilling only about
one-fourth of the land that could be made productive. If we use our
brains there is little danger of starving. What is needed now is not
more food, but intelligent distribution and consumption of what we
produce.</p>

<p id="id00329" class="calibre1">We hear of cases of undernourishment. This doubtless occurs at times in
the congested parts of great centers of populations. But there are not
so many cases suffering from want of the proper quantity of food as from
want of quality of food. Bread of finely bolted white flour is
starvation food, no matter how great the quantity, unless other food
rich in organic salts is also eaten.</p>

<p id="id00330" class="calibre1">The overeating habit is so common and comes on so insidiously that the
sufferers do not realize that they are eating to excess. The resultant
discomforts are blamed on other things. Babies are fed every two hours
or oftener. They should be fed but three or at most four times a day,
and never at night. When able to eat solid foods they get three meals a
day and generally two or more lunches. Some children seem to be lunching
at all times. They have fruit or bread and butter with jelly or jam in
the hand almost all the time. They are encouraged to eat much and often
to produce growth and strength. This kind of feeding often does produce
large children, heavy in weight, but they are not healthy. Sad to
relate, the excess causes disease and death.</p>

<p id="id00331" class="calibre1">Such frequent feeding allows the digestive organs no rest. The overwork
imposed upon them and the fermentation cause irritation. This irritation
manifests in a constant and almost irresistible desire for food, as does
the consumption of much alcohol cause a desire for more alcohol, as the
use of morphine or cocaine produces a dominating and ruinous appetite
for more of these drugs. These appetites grow by what they feed upon.
Man ceases to be master and becomes the abject slave of his abnormal
cravings.</p>

<p id="id00332" class="calibre1">Slaves of alcohol and the various habit-forming drugs generally lack the
strength of body and mind to assert themselves and to regain mastery of
themselves. Coffee and tea have their victims, though they are generally
not very firmly enslaved. No one realizes how he is bound by his
cravings for an excessive amount of food until he tries to break the
bonds. Such people may eat moderately for days, perhaps for weeks, and
then the old appetite reasserts itself in all its strength and unless
the sufferer has a very strong will a food debauch follows. I have seen
men go from one restaurant to another, consuming enormous quantities of
food to efface the awful craving, just as men go from one saloon to
another to satisfy their desire for alcohol. The gluttons often look
with the greatest contempt upon the slaves of liquor. But what is the
difference? No matter what appetite, what habit, what passion has gained
the mastery, we are slaves. The important thing is to keep out of
slavery, or break the bonds and regain freedom.</p>

<p id="id00333" class="calibre1">Those who eat to excess often eat more than three times a day. They take
a little candy now, a little fruit then, or they go to the drug store
for a glass of malted milk or buttermilk, which they call drinks, or
they take a dish of ice cream. The housewife nibbles at cake or bread.
If a person is in fair health and wishes to evolve into self-mastery and
good health, he should make up his mind never to eat more than three
times a day. Nothing but plain water should enter his mouth except at
meal times.</p>

<p id="id00334" class="calibre1">Next he should limit the number of articles eaten at a meal. The
breakfast and lunch should each consist of no more than two or three
varieties of food. The dinner should not exceed five or six varieties,
and if that many are eaten, they should be compatible. Less would be
better. The less variety we have, the better the food digests. Also,
eating ten or twelve or more kinds of food, as many people do, always
leads to overeating. A little of this added to a little of that soon
makes a too great total. It is easy to eat all one should of a certain
article of food and feel satisfied, and then change off to something
else and before one is through one has eaten three or four times as much
as necessary. If the meal is to consist of starch there is no great
objection to a small amount of bread, potatoes, rice, macaroni and
chestnuts. However, a normal person does not need to coax food down by
using great variety. Those who mix their foods this way invariably
overeat. Besides, the various starches require different periods for
digestion. Rice is more easily disposed of than bread. Each new item
stimulates the desire for more food. It is best, when having potatoes,
to have no other starchy food in that meal; or when bread is eaten, to
have no potatoes or other starchy food. The habit of eating meat,
potatoes and bread in the same meal is very common and causes much
disease.</p>

<p id="id00335" class="calibre1">Next the searcher for health should teach himself to eat foods that are
natural, cooked simply, and with a minimum amount of seasoning and
dressing. The various spices and sauces irritate the digestive organs
and create a craving for an excessive amount of food. The food should be
changed as little as possible because such denatured foods as white
flour, polished rice, pasteurized milk, and many of the canned fruits
and vegetables are so lacking in the natural salts that they do not
satisfy one's desire for organic salts. Overeating results.</p>

<p id="id00336" class="calibre1">Preserves, jellies and jams are open to the same objection. They cause
an abnormal desire for food. Therefore, they should be used seldom and
very sparingly. So long as apples, oranges, figs, dates, raisins, sweet
prunes and various other fruits can be had, there is no excuse for the
consumption of great quantities of the heavily sugared concoctions which
are now so popular.</p>

<p id="id00337" class="calibre1">Simplicity and naturalness are great aids in breaking away from food
slavery. They are discussed more fully elsewhere. In the next chapter
will be found hints on the solution of the normal amount of food to be
eaten.</p>
