<h5 id="id00339" class="calibre5">DAILY FOOD INTAKE.</h5>

<p id="id00340" class="calibre1">It is generally believed that the more we eat the better. Physicians say
that it is necessary to eat heartily when well to retain health and
strength. When ill it is necessary to consume much food to regain lost
health and strength. "Eat all you can of nourishing food," is a common
free prescription, and it sounds very reasonable. The physicians of
today are not to blame for this belief in overeating, for they were
taught thus at college, and very few men in any line do original
thinking. It has been a racial belief for centuries and no one now
living is responsible. When a physician advocates what he honestly
believes he is doing his best, "and angels can do no more."</p>

<p id="id00341" class="calibre1">When a child loses its appetite, the parents worry, for they think that
it is very harmful for young people to go without food for a few meals.
A lost appetite is nature's signal to quit eating, and it should always
be heeded. If it is, it will prevent much disease and suffering and will
save many lives.</p>

<p id="id00342" class="calibre1">The present-day mode of preparing food leads to overeating. The sense of
taste is ruined by the stimulants put into the food. Dishes are so
numerous and so temptingly made that more is eaten than can be digested
and assimilated. Refined sugar, salt, the various spices, pickles,
sauces and preserves all lead to overeating because of stimulation. The
same is true of alcohol taken immediately before meals. If we only give
nature a chance, and are perfectly frank and honest with ourselves, she
will guard us against the overconsumption of food. Those who eat but few
varieties of plain food at a meal are not sorely tempted to overeat. But
when one savory dish is served after another it takes much will power to
be moderate.</p>

<p id="id00343" class="calibre1">People generally have had more than sufficient before the last course is
served.  However, the various dishes have different flavors and for this
reason the palate is overwhelmed and accepts more food than is good for
us.</p>

<p id="id00344" class="calibre1">Men who like to call their work scientific, figure on the amount of food
we need to furnish a certain number of heat units—calories. Heat, of
course, is a form of energy. Basing the body's food requirements on heat
units expended does not solve the problem. The more food that is
ingested, the more heat units must be manufactured, and often so much
food is taken that the body is compelled to go into the heating
business. Then we have fevers.</p>

<p id="id00345" class="calibre1">A large part of the heat is given off by the skin. Those who overeat are
compelled to do a great deal of radiating. This excessive amount of fuel
taken into the system in the form of food, wears out the body. As
figured by the experts, it gives a result of food need that is at least
twice as great as necessary. Experience is the only correct guide to
food requirements, and each individual has to settle the matter for
himself. The human body is not exactly a chemical laboratory, nor is it
an engine which can be fed so much fuel with the resultant production of
such and such an amount of heat and energy. Some bodies are more
efficient than others. It is among human beings as among the lower
animals, some require more food than others.</p>

<p id="id00346" class="calibre1">We need enough food to repair the waste, to perform our work and to
furnish heat. Every muscle contraction uses up a little energy. Every
breath deprives us of heat and carries away carbon dioxide, the latter
being formed by oxidation of tissues in the body. Every minute we lose
heat by radiation from the skin. Every thought requires a small amount
of food. If we worry, the leak of nervous energy is tremendous, but at
the same time we put ourselves in position where we are unable to
replenish our stock, for worry ruins digestion. All this expenditure of
energy and loss of heat must be made up for by the food intake. Only a
small amount of surplus food can be stored in the body. Some fat can be
stored as fat. Some starch and sugar can be put aside as either
glycogen—animal sugar—or be changed into fat. This storing of excess
food is very limited, except in cases of obesity, which is a disease.</p>

<p id="id00347" class="calibre1">Overeating invariably causes disease. It may take two or three years,
yes even twenty or thirty years, before the overeating results in
serious illness, but the results are certain, and in the meanwhile the
individual is never up to par. He can use neither body nor mind to the
best advantage.</p>

<p id="id00348" class="calibre1">To emphasize and illustrate these remarks, I shall copy a few diet
lists, which their authors consider reasonable and correct for the
average person for one day, and I shall give my comments. The first is
taken from Kirke's Physiology, which has been used extensively as a
text-book in medical colleges:</p>

<p id="id00349" class="calibre1">  340 grams lean uncooked meat,<br class="calibre12"/>

  600   "   bread,<br class="calibre12"/>

   90   "   butter,<br class="calibre12"/>

   28   "   cheese,<br class="calibre12"/>

  225   "   potatoes,<br class="calibre12"/>

  225   "   carrots.<br class="calibre12"/>
</p>

<p id="id00350" class="calibre1">An ounce contains 28.3 grams; a pound, 453 grams. It is easy to figure
these quantities of food in ounces or pounds, which give a better idea
to the average person.</p>

<p id="id00351" class="calibre1">It is self-evident that this is too much food. Over twelve ounces of
lean, uncooked meat, over twenty-one ounces of bread, almost one-half of
a pound each of potatoes and carrots, about an ounce of cheese and over
three ounces of butter make enough food for two days, even for a big
eater. He who tries to live up to a diet of this kind is sure to suffer
disease and early death.</p>

<p id="id00352" class="calibre1">The average loaf of bread weighs about fourteen ounces. Here we are told
to devour one-half of a pound of carrots (for which other vegetables
such as turnips, parsnips, beets or cabbage may be substituted),
one-half of a pound of potatoes, three-fourths of a pound of lean raw
meat, which loses some weight in cooking, a loaf and one-half of bread,
besides butter and cheese. The vast majority of people can not eat more
than one-third of this amount and retain efficiency and health, but many
eat even more.</p>

<p id="id00353" class="calibre1">The next table is taken from Dr. I. Burney Yeo's book on diet, and is
given as the food required daily by a "well nourished worker":</p>

<p id="id00354" class="calibre1">   151.3 grams meat,<br class="calibre12"/>

    48.1   "   white of egg,<br class="calibre12"/>

   450.0   "   bread,<br class="calibre12"/>

   500.0   "   milk,<br class="calibre12"/>

  1065.9   "   beer,<br class="calibre12"/>

    60.2   "   suet,<br class="calibre12"/>

    30.0   "   butter,<br class="calibre12"/>

    70.0   "   starch,<br class="calibre12"/>

    17.0   "   sugar,<br class="calibre12"/>

     4.9   "   salt.<br class="calibre12"/>
</p>

<p id="id00355" class="calibre1">This worker is too well fed. Often those who are so well fed are poorly
nourished, for the excessive amount of food ruins the nutrition, after
which the food is poorly digested and assimilated. This worker eats so
much that he will be compelled to do manual labor all his days, for such
feeding prevents effective thinking.</p>

<p id="id00356" class="calibre1">The following daily average diet is taken from the book, "Diet and
Dietetics," by A. Gauthier, a well known authority on the subject of the
nutritive needs of the body. Mr. Gauthier averaged the daily food intake
of the inhabitants of Paris for the ten years from 1890 to 1899,
inclusive. He takes it for granted that this is the average daily food
requirement for a person:</p>

<p id="id00357" class="calibre1">  420.0 grams bread and cakes,<br class="calibre12"/>

  216.0   "   boned meat,<br class="calibre12"/>

   24.1   "   eggs (weighed with shell),<br class="calibre12"/>

    8.1   "   cheese (dry or cream),<br class="calibre12"/>

   28.0   "   butter, oil, etc.,<br class="calibre12"/>

   70.0   "   fresh fruit,<br class="calibre12"/>

  250.0   "   green vegetables,<br class="calibre12"/>

   40.0   "   dried vegetables,<br class="calibre12"/>

  100.0   "   potatoes, rice,<br class="calibre12"/>

   40.0   "   sugar,<br class="calibre12"/>

   20.0   "   salt,<br class="calibre12"/>

  213.0 C. C. milk,<br class="calibre12"/>

  557.0 C. C. of various alcoholics, containing<br class="calibre12"/>

    9.5 C. C. of pure alcohol.<br class="calibre12"/>
</p>

<p id="id00358" class="calibre1">So long as the Parisians consume such quantities of food they will
continue to suffer and die before they reach one-half of the age that
should be theirs. The French eat no more than do other people, in fact,
they seem moderate in their food intake as compared with some of the
Germans, English and Americans, but they eat too much for their physical
and mental good.</p>

<p id="id00359" class="calibre1">The lists given above are from sources that command the respect of the
medical profession. They are the orthodox and popular opinions. It would
be an easy matter to give many more tables, but they agree so closely
that it would be a waste of time and space.</p>

<p id="id00360" class="calibre1">Quantitative tables from vegetarian sources are not so common. The
vegetarians say that meat eating is wrong, being contrary to nature.
Whether they are right or wrong, they make the same mistakes that the
orthodox prescribers do, that is, they advocate overeating. Medical
textbooks prescribe a too abundant supply of starch and meat in
particular. The vegetarians prescribe a superabundance of starch. Read
the magazines advocating vegetarianism and note their menus, giving
numerous cereals, tubers, peas, beans, lentils, as well as other
vegetables, for the same meal. It is as easy to overeat of nuts and
protein in leguminous vegetables as it is to overeat of meat.</p>

<p id="id00361" class="calibre1">Starch poisoning is as bad as meat poisoning and the results are equally
fatal.</p>

<p id="id00362" class="calibre1">The following are suggestions offered by a fruitarian. They give the
food intake for two days:</p>

<p id="id00363" class="calibre1">   120 grams shelled peanuts, raw,<br class="calibre12"/>

  1000   "   apples,<br class="calibre12"/>

   500   "   unfermented whole wheat bread.<br class="calibre12"/>
</p>

<p id="id00364" class="calibre1">   120 grams shelled filberts,<br class="calibre12"/>

   450   "   raisins,<br class="calibre12"/>

   800   "   bananas.<br class="calibre12"/>
</p>

<p id="id00365" class="calibre1">In the first day's menu it will be noted that over two pounds of apples
and over one pound of whole wheat bread are recommended, also over four
ounces of raw peanuts. The writer says that this food should preferably
be taken in two meals. There are very few people with enough digestive
and assimilative power to care for more than one-half of a pound of
whole wheat bread twice a day, especially when taken with raw peanuts,
which are rather hard to digest. The trouble is made worse by the
addition of more than one pound of apples to each meal, for when apples
in large quantities are eaten with liberal amounts of starch, the
tendency for the food to ferment is so strong that only a very few
escape. Gas is produced in great quantities, which is both unnatural and
unpleasant. Neither stomach nor bowels manufacture any perceptible
amount of gas if they are in good condition and a moderate amount of
food is taken.</p>

<p id="id00366" class="calibre1">Whole wheat bread digests easily enough when eaten in moderation, but it
is very difficult to digest when as much as eight ounces are taken at a
meal. One can accustom the body to accept this amount of food, but it is
never required under ordinary conditions and the results in the long run
are bad.</p>

<p id="id00367" class="calibre1">The food prescribed for the second day is more easily digested, but it
is too much. Raisins are a splendid force food, but no ordinary
individual needs a pound of raisins in one day, in addition to about one
and three-fourths pounds of bananas, which are also a force food and are
about as nourishing as the same amount of Irish potatoes.</p>

<p id="id00368" class="calibre1">In all my reading it has not been my good fortune to find a diet table
for healthy people, giving moderate quantities of food. Diet lists seem
scientific, so they appeal to the mind that has not learned to think of
the subject from the correct point of view. Quantitative diet tables are
worthless, for one person may need more than another. Some are short and
some are tall. Some are naturally slender and others of stocky build.
There is as much difference in people's food needs as there is in their
appearance. To try to fit the same quantity and even kind of food to all
is as senseless as it would be to dress all in garments of identical
size and cut.</p>

<p id="id00369" class="calibre1">If we eat in moderation it does not make much difference what we eat,
provided our diet contains either raw fruits or raw vegetables enough to
furnish the various mineral salts and the food is fairly well prepared.
There are combinations that are not ideal, but they do very little harm
if there is no overeating. People who are moderate in their eating
generally relish simple foods. Unfortunately, there is but little
moderation in eating. From childhood on the suggestion that it is
necessary to eat liberally is ever before us. Medical men, grandparents,
parents and neighbors think and talk alike. If the parents believe in
moderation, the neighbors kindly give lunches to the children. It is
really difficult to raise children right, especially in towns and
cities.</p>

<p id="id00370" class="calibre1">After such training we learn to believe in overeating and we pass the
belief on to the next generation, as it has in the past been handed down
from generation to generation. Finally we die, many of us martyrs to
overconsumption of food. Ask any healer of intelligence who has thrown
off the blinders put on at college and who has allowed himself to think
without fear, and he will tell you that at least nine-tenths of our ills
come from improper eating habits. It is not difficult to make up menus
of compatible foods. No one knows how much another should eat, and he
who prepares quantitative diet tables for the multitude must fail.</p>

<p id="id00371" class="calibre1">However, every individual of ordinary intelligence can quickly learn his
own food requirements and the key thereto is given by nature. It is not
well to think of one's self much or often. It is not well to be
introspective, but everyone should get acquainted with himself, learning
to know himself well enough to treat himself with due consideration. We
are taught kindness to others. We need to be taught kindness to
ourselves. The average person ought to be able to learn his normal food
requirements within three or four months, and a shorter time will often
suffice.</p>

<p id="id00372" class="calibre1">The following observations will prove helpful to the careful reader:</p>

<p id="id00373" class="calibre1">Food should have a pleasant taste while it is being eaten, but should
not taste afterwards. If it does it is a sign of indigestion following
overeating, or else it indicates improper combinations or very poor
cooking. Perhaps food was taken when there was no desire for it, which
is always a mistake. Perhaps too many foods were combined in the meal.
Or it may be that there was not enough mouth preparation. It is
generally due to overeating. Cabbage, onions, cucumbers and various
other foods which often repeat, will not do so when properly prepared
and eaten in moderation, if other conditions are right.</p>

<p id="id00374" class="calibre1">Eructation of gas and gas in the bowels are indications of overeating.
More food is taken than can be digested. A part of it ferments and gas
is a product of fermentation. A very small amount of gas in the
alimentary tract is natural, but when there is belching or rumbling of
gas in the intestines it is a sign of indigestion, which may be so mild
that the individual is not aware of it, or it may be so bad that he can
think of little else. When there is formation of much gas it is always
necessary to reduce the food intake, and to give special attention to
the mastication of all starch-containing aliments. Also, if starches and
sour fruits have been combined habitually, this combination should be
given up. Starch digests in an alkaline medium, and if it is taken with
much acid by those whose digestive powers are weak, the result is
fermentation instead of digestion.</p>

<p id="id00375" class="calibre1">People should never eat enough to experience a feeling of languor. They
should quit eating before they feel full. If there is a desire to sleep
after meals, too much food has been ingested. When drowsiness possesses
us after meals we have eaten so much that the digestive organs require
so much blood that there is not enough left for the brain. This is a
hint that if we have work or study that requires exceptional clearness
of mind, we should eat very moderately or not at all immediately before.
The digestive organs appropriate the needed amount of blood and the
brain refuses to do its best when deprived of its normal supply of
oxygen and nourishment.</p>

<p id="id00376" class="calibre1">Serpents, some beasts of prey and savages devour such large quantities
of food at times that they go into a stupor. There is no excuse for our
patterning after them now that a supply of food is easily obtained at
all times.</p>

<p id="id00377" class="calibre1">A bad taste in the mouth is usually a sign of overeating. It comes from
the decomposition following a too liberal food intake. If water has a
bad taste in the morning or at any other time, it indicates overeating.
It may be due to a filthy mouth or the use of alcohol.</p>

<p id="id00378" class="calibre1">Heartburn is also due to overeating, and so is hiccough; both come from
fermentation of food in the alimentary tract.</p>

<p id="id00379" class="calibre1">A heavily coated tongue in the morning indicates excessive food intake.
If the tongue is what is known as a dirty gray color it shows that the
owner has been overeating for years. The normal mucous membrane is clean
and pink. The mucous membrane of the mouth, stomach and the first part
of the bowels should not be compelled to act as an organ of excretion,
for the normal function is secretory and absorptive. However, when so
much food is eaten that the skin, lungs, kidneys and lower bowel can not
throw off all the waste and excess, the mucous membrane in the upper
part of the alimentary tract must assist. The result is a coated tongue,
but the tongue is in no worse condition than the mucous membrane of the
stomach. A coated tongue indicates overcrowded nutrition and is nature's
request to reduce the food intake. How much? Enough to clean the tongue.
If the coating is chronic it may take several months before the tongue
becomes clean.</p>

<p id="id00380" class="calibre1">A muddy skin, perhaps pimply, is another sign of overeating. It shows
that the food intake is so great that the body tries to eliminate too
many of the solids through the skin, which becomes irritated from this
cause and the too acid state of the system and then there is
inflammation. Many forms of eczema and a great many other skin diseases
are caused by stomach disorders and an overcrowded nutrition. There is a
limit to the skin's excretory ability, and when this is exceeded skin
diseases ensue. Some of the so-called incurable skin diseases get well
in a short time on a proper diet without any local treatment.</p>

<p id="id00381" class="calibre1">Dull eyes and a greenish tinge of the whites of the eyes point toward
digestive disturbances due to an oversupply of food. The green color
comes from bile thrown into the blood when the liver is overworked. The
liver is never overtaxed unless the consumption of food is excessive.</p>

<p id="id00382" class="calibre1">Another very common sign of too generous feeding is catarrh, and it does
not matter where the catarrh is located. It is true that there are other
causes of catarrh, in fact, anything that irritates the mucous membrane
any length of time will cause it, but an overcrowded nutrition causes
the ordinary cases. It is the same old story: The mucous membrane is
forced to take on the function of eliminating superfluous matter, which
has been taken into the system in the form of food. Many people dedicate
their lives to the act of turning a superabundance of food into waste,
and as a result they overwork their bodies so that they are never well
physically and seldom efficient mentally.</p>

<p id="id00383" class="calibre1">Many people, especially women, say that if they miss a meal or get it
later than usual, they suffer from headache. This indicates that the
feeding is wrong, generally too generous and often too stimulating. A
normal person can miss a dozen meals without a sign of a headache.</p>

<p id="id00384" class="calibre1">To repeat: No one can tell how much another should eat, but everyone can
learn for himself what the proper amount of food is. Enough is given
above to help solve the problem. The interpretations presented are not
the popular ones, but they are true for they give good results when
acted upon.</p>

<p id="id00385" class="calibre1">If bad results follow a meal there has been overeating, either at the
last meal or previously. Undermasticating usually accompanies overeating
and causes further trouble. Those who masticate thoroughly are generally
quite moderate in their food intake.</p>

<p id="id00386" class="calibre1">Many say that they eat so much because they enjoy their food so. He who
eats too rapidly or in excess does not know what true enjoyment of food
is. Excessive eating causes food poisoning, and food poisoning blunts
all the special senses. To have normal smell, taste, hearing and vision
one must be clean through and through, and those who are surfeited with
food are not clean internally.</p>

<p id="id00387" class="calibre1">The average individual does not know the natural taste of most foods. He
seasons them so highly that the normal taste is hidden or destroyed.
Those who wish to know the exquisite flavor of such common foods as
onions, carrots, cabbage, apples and oranges must eat them without
seasoning or dressing for a while. To get real enjoyment from food it is
necessary to eat slowly and in moderation.</p>

<p id="id00388" class="calibre1">I know both from personal experience and from the experience of others
that seasoning is not necessary. Instead of giving the foods better
flavor, they taste inferior. A little salt will harm no one, but the
constant use of much seasoning leads to irritation of the digestive
organs and to overeating. Salt taken in excess also helps to bring on
premature aging. It is splendid for pickling and preserving, but health
and life in abundance are the only preservatives needed for the body.
Refined sugar should be classed among the condiments. People who live
normally lose the desire for it. Grapefruit, for instance, tastes better
when eaten plain than when sugar is added.</p>

<p id="id00389" class="calibre1">People who sleep seven or eight hours and wake up feeling unrefreshed
are suffering from the ingestion of too much food. A food poisoned
individual can not be properly rested. To get sweet sleep and feel
restored it is necessary to have clean blood and a sweet alimentary
tract.</p>

<p id="id00390" class="calibre1">Much has been said about overeating. Once in a while a person will
habitually undereat, but such cases are exceedingly rare. To undereat is
foolish. At all times we must use good sense. It is a subject upon which
no fixed rules can be promulgated. Be guided by the feelings, for
perfect health is impossible to those who lack balance.</p>

<p id="id00391" class="calibre1">Those who think they need scientific direction may take one of the
orthodox diet tables. If it contains alcoholics, remove them from the
list. Then partake of about one-third of the starch recommended, and
about one-third of the protein. Use more fresh fruit and fresh
vegetables than listed. Instead of eating bread made from white flour,
use whole wheat bread. Do not try to eat everything given on the
scientific diet list each day. For instance, rice, potatoes and bread
are given in many of these tables. Select one of these starches one day,
another the next day, etc. If one-third of the amount recommended is too
much, and it sometimes is, reduce still further.</p>

<p id="id00392" class="calibre1">Please bear in mind that the orthodox way, the so-called scientific way,
has been tried over a long period of time and it has given very poor
results. Moderation has always given good results and always will.</p>

<div class="calibre10"></div><div class="calibre10"></div><h2 id="id00393" class="calibre11">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h5 id="id00394" class="calibre5">WHAT TO EAT.</h5>

<p id="id00395" class="calibre1">It is very important to eat the right kind of food, but it is even more
important to be balanced and use common sense. Those who are moderate in
their habits and cheerful can eat almost anything with good results. Of
course, people who live almost entirely on such denatured foods as
polished rice, finely bolted wheat flour products, sterilized milk and
meat spoiled in the cooking, refined sugar and potatoes deprived of most
of their salts through being soaked and cooked will suffer.</p>

<p id="id00396" class="calibre1">There are many different diet systems, and some of them are very good.
If their advocates say that their way is the only way, they are wrong.
Many try to force their ideas upon others. They find their happiness in
making others miserable. They are afflicted with the proselyting zeal
that makes fools of people. This is the wrong way to solve the food
problem. Let each individual choose his own way and allow those who
differ to continue in the old way.</p>

<p id="id00397" class="calibre1">Many have changed their dietary habits to their own great benefit. After
this they become so enthused and anxious for others to do likewise that
they wear themselves and others out exhorting them to share in the new
discovery. This does no good, but it often does harm, for it leads the
zealot to think too much of and about himself, and it annoys others.</p>

<p id="id00398" class="calibre1">Many are like my friend who lunched daily on zwieback and raw carrots.
"I think everybody ought to eat some raw carrots every day; don't you?"
she said. We can not mold everybody to our liking, and we should not
try. If we conquer ourselves, we have about all we can do. If we succeed
in this great work, we will evolve enough tolerance to be willing to
allow others to shape their own ends. To volunteer undesired information
does no good, for it creates opposition in the mind of the hearers. If
the information is sought, the chances are that it may in time do good.
It is well enough to indicate how and where better knowledge may be
obtained. We should at all times attempt to conserve our energy and use
it only when and where it is helpful. Such conduct leads to peace of
mind, effectiveness, happiness and health.</p>

<p id="id00399" class="calibre1">The tendency to become too enthusiastic about a dietary regime that has
brought personal benefit is to be avoided, for it brings unnecessary
odium upon the important subject of food reform. People do not like to
change old habits, even if the change would be for the better, and when
an enthusiast tries to force the change his actions are resented. He
makes no real converts, but as pay for his efforts he gains the
reputation of being a crank.</p>

<p id="id00400" class="calibre1">Those who wish to be helpful in an educational way should be patient.
The race has been in the making for ages. Its good habits, as well as
its bad ones, have been acquired gradually. If we ever get rid of our
bad habits it will be through gradual evolution, not through a hasty
revolution. We need a change in dietary habits, but those who become
food cranks, insisting that others be as they, retard this movement.
Only a few will change physical and mental habits suddenly. If those who
know are content to show the benefits more in results than in words,
their influence for good will be great.</p>

<p id="id00401" class="calibre1">What shall we eat? How are we to know the truth among so many
conflicting ideas? We can know the truth because it leads to health.
Error leads to suffering, degeneration and premature death. As the
homely saying goes, "The proof of the pudding is in the eating."</p>

<p id="id00402" class="calibre1">Let us look into some of the diet theories before the public and give
them thoughtful consideration.</p>

<p id="id00403" class="calibre1">The late Dr. J. H. Salisbury advocated the use of water to drink and
meat to eat, and nothing else. The water was to be taken warm and in
copious quantities, but not at or near meal time. The meat, preferably
beef, was to be scraped or minced, made into cakes and cooked in a very
warm skillet until the cakes turned gray within. These meat cakes were
to be eaten three times a day, seasoned with salt and a little pepper.</p>

<p id="id00404" class="calibre1">The doctor had a very successful practice, which is attested by many who
were benefited when ordinary medical skill failed. His diet was not well
balanced. In meats there is a lack of the cell salts and force food.
Especially are the cell salts lacking when the flesh is drained of its
blood. The animals of prey drink the blood and crunch many of the bones
of their victims, thus getting nearly all the salts. But in spite of his
giving such an unbalanced diet, the doctor had a satisfactory practice
and good success. Why? Because his patients had to quit using narcotics
and stimulants and they were compelled to consume such simple food that
they ceased overeating. It is a well known fact that a mono-diet forces
moderation, for there is no desire to overeat, as there is when living
on a very varied diet.</p>

<p id="id00405" class="calibre1">Another fact that the Salisbury plan brings to mind is that starch and
sugar are not necessary for the feeding of adults, although they are
convenient and cheap foods and ordinarily consumed in large quantities.
The fat in the meat takes the place of the starch and sugar. Atomically,
starch, sugar and fat are almost identical, and they can be substituted
one for the other. Nature makes broad provisions.</p>

<p id="id00406" class="calibre1">Dr. Salisbury's career also serves to remind us that a mixed diet is not
necessary for the physical welfare of those who eat to live. Vegetarians
dwell upon the toxicity of meat. But Dr. Salisbury fed his patients on
nothing but meat and water, and the percentage of recoveries in chronic
diseases was considered remarkable. Meat is very easy to digest and when
prepared in the simple manner prescribed by the doctor and eaten by
itself it will agree with nearly everybody. But when eaten with soup,
bread, potatoes, vegetables, cooked and raw, fish, pudding, fruit,
coffee, crackers and cheese, there will be overeating followed by
indigestion and its consequent train of ills. However, it is not fair to
blame the meat entirely, for the whole mixture goes into decomposition
and poisons the body.</p>

<p id="id00407" class="calibre1">The cures resulting from Dr. Salisbury's plan also help to disprove the
much heralded theory of Dr. Haig, that uric acid from meat eating is the
cause of rheumatism. Overeating of meat is often a contributory cause.
We are told that the rheumatics who followed Dr. Salisbury's plan got
well. They regained physical tone. They lost their gout and rheumatism.
They parted company with their pimples and blotches. All of which would
indicate that the blood became clean.</p>

<p id="id00408" class="calibre1">The chief lesson derived from Dr. Salisbury's plan and experience is the
helpfulness of simple living and moderation. An exclusive diet of meat
is not well balanced.  Energy produced from flesh food is too expensive.
The good results came from substituting habits of simplicity and
moderation for the habit of overeating of too great variety of food. The
same results may be obtained by putting a patient on bread and milk.</p>

<p id="id00409" class="calibre1">Dr. Salisbury's patients had unsatisfied longings, doubtless for various
tissue salts. The addition of fresh raw fruits or vegetables would
improve his diet, for apples, peaches, pears, lettuce, celery and
cabbage are rich in the salts in which meats are deficient.</p>

<p id="id00410" class="calibre1">Dr. Emmet Densmore recommended omitting the starches entirely, that is,
to avoid such foods as cereals, tubers and legumes. He believed that it
is best to live on fruits and nuts. He recommended the sweet
fruits—figs, dates, raisins, prunes—instead of the starchy foods. The
doctor did much good, as everyone does who gets his patients to
simplify. He also had good results before discovering that starch is a
harmful food, when he fed his patients bread and milk.</p>

<p id="id00411" class="calibre1">Starch must be converted into sugar before it can be used by the body.
The sugar is what is known as dextrose, not the refined sugar of
commerce. The sweet fruits contain this sugar in the form of fruit
sugar, which needs but little preparation to be absorbed by the blood.
Dr. Densmore reasons thus: Only birds are furnished with mills
(gizzards); hence the grains are fit food for them only. Other starches
should be avoided because they are difficult to digest, the doctor
wrote.</p>

<p id="id00412" class="calibre1">Raw starches are difficult to digest, but when they are properly cooked
they are digested in a reasonable time without overburdening the system,
provided they are well masticated and the amount eaten is not too great
and the combining is correct. Rice, which contains much starch, digests
in a short time.</p>

<p id="id00413" class="calibre1">We can do very nicely without starch. We can also thrive on it if we do
not abuse it. The two chief starch-bearing staples, rice and wheat,
contain considerable protein and salts in their natural state. In fact,
the natural wheat will sustain life for a long time. Man has improved on
nature by polishing the rice and making finely bolted, bleached wheat
flour, deprived of nearly all the salts in the wheat berry. The result
is that both of them have become very poor foods. The more we eat of
these refined products the worse off we are, unless we partake freely of
other foods rich in mineral salts.</p>

<p id="id00414" class="calibre1">Not long ago a lady died in England who was a prominent advocate of a
"brainy diet." Her brainy diet consisted largely of excessive quantities
of meat, pork being a favorite. She died comparatively young, her
friends say from overwork. Such a diet doubtless had a large part in
wearing her out. To overeat of meat is dangerous.</p>

<p id="id00415" class="calibre1">A gentleman is now advocating a diet of nothing but cocoanuts. This is a
fad, for they are not a balanced food. He has published a book on the
subject. Perhaps his advocacy is influenced by his interest in the sale
of cocoanuts.</p>

<p id="id00416" class="calibre1">The vegetarians condemn the use of meat. Some of them are called
fruitarians. It is very difficult to decide who are the most
representative of them. Some advocate the use of nothing but fruit and
nuts. Others add cereals to this. Others use vegetables in addition.
Some even allow the use of dairy products and eggs, that is, all foods
except flesh.</p>

<p id="id00417" class="calibre1">They say that meat is an unnatural food for man and condemn its use on
moral grounds. It is difficult to decide what is natural, for we find
that man is very adaptable, being able to live on fruits in the tropics
and almost exclusively on flesh food, largely fat, in the arctic
regions. In nature the strong live on the weak and the intelligent on
the dull. There is no sentiment in nature. In her domain might, physical
or mental, makes right. Sentiments of right and justice are not highly
developed except among human beings, and even there they are so weakly
implanted that it takes but little provocation for civilized man to bare
his teeth in a wolfish snarl.</p>

<p id="id00418" class="calibre1">With some vegetarianism is largely a matter of esthetics, ethics and
morality. Morality is based on expediency, so it really is a question
whether meat is an advantageous food or not.</p>

<p id="id00419" class="calibre1">Another vegetarian argument is that man's anatomy proves that he was not
intended by nature to eat meat. Good arguments have been used on both
sides, but they are not very convincing nor are they conclusive. It is
hard to draw any lines fairly.</p>

<p id="id00420" class="calibre1">Another objection to meat is that it is unclean and full of poisons,
that these poisons produce various diseases, such as cancer. We are also
informed that refined sugar causes cancer, and the belief in tomatoes as
a causative factor is not dead. Cancer is without doubt caused
principally by dietary indiscretions but it is impossible to single out
any one food.</p>

<p id="id00421" class="calibre1">No matter what foods we eat, we are compelled to be careful or they will
be unclean. Those who wish clean meat can obtain it. The amount of
poison or waste in a proper portion of meat is so small that we need
give it no thought.  Those who eat in moderation can take meat once a
day during cold weather and enjoy splendid health. During warm weather
it should be eaten more seldom.</p>

<p id="id00422" class="calibre1">On the other hand, meat is not necessary. We need a certain amount of
protein, which we can obtain from nuts, eggs, milk, cheese, peanuts,
peas, beans, lentils, cereals and from other food in smaller amounts.
The amount of protein needed is small—about one-fifth of what the
physiologists used to recommend.</p>

<p id="id00423" class="calibre1">Those who think meat eating is wrong should not partake of it. They can
get along very well without it. We are consuming entirely too much meat
in America. The organism can stand it if the life is active in the fresh
air, but it will not do for people who are housed. Much meat eating
causes physical degeneration. The body loses tone. Experiments have
shown that vegetarians have more resistance and endurance than the meat
eaters, but the meat eaters get so much stimulation from their food that
they can speed up in spurts. The excretions of meat eaters are more
poisonous than those of vegetarians.</p>

<p id="id00424" class="calibre1">Eggs produced by hens fed largely on meat scraps do not keep as well as
those laid by hens feeding more on grains. In short, meat eating leads
to instability or degeneration, if carried to excess. Young children
should have none of it and it would be a very easy matter for the rising
generation to develop without using meat, and I believe this would be
better than our present plan of eating. However, let us give flesh food
the credit due it. When meat eaters are debilitated no other food seems
to act as kindly as meat, given with fruits or vegetables. When properly
prepared and taken in moderation meat digests easily and is quite
completely assimilated.</p>

<p id="id00425" class="calibre1">Many make the mistake of living too exclusively on starch and taking it
in excess. The result is fermentation and an acid state of the
alimentary tract. Dr. Daniel S. Sager says that, "About all that we have
to fear in eating is excessive use of proteids." Experience and
observation do not bear out this statement, for it is as easy to find
people injured by starch as by protein. One form of poisoning is as bad
as the other. The doctor also warns against nearly all the succulent
vegetables, saying that on account of the indigestible fibre, most of
them are unfit for human consumption.</p>

<p id="id00426" class="calibre1">Dr. E. H. Dewey condemned the apple as a disease-producer, and
inferentially, other fruits.</p>

<p id="id00427" class="calibre1">Dr. Charles E. Page objects to the use of milk by adults, on the ground
that it is fit food only for the calves for whom nature intended it.
Many writers have repeated this opinion.</p>

<p id="id00428" class="calibre1">Most of the regular physicians have a very vague idea of dietetics and
proper feeding. When asked what to eat they commonly say, "Eat plenty
nourishing food of the kinds that agree with you." They do not point out
the fundamentals to their patients. Sometimes they advise avoiding
combinations of milk and fruits. Sometimes they say that all starches
should be avoided and in the next breath prescribe toast, one of the
starchiest of foods. At times they proscribe pork and pickles but they
are seldom able to give a good diet prescription. What people need is a
fair knowledge of what to do and the don'ts will take care of
themselves.</p>

<p id="id00429" class="calibre1">All foods have been condemned as unfit for human consumption by people
who should know. However, those who look at these matters with open eyes
and open minds will come to the conclusion that man is a very adaptable
animal; that if necessary he can get along without almost all foods,
being able to subsist on a very small variety; that he can live for a
long period on animal food entirely; that he can live all his life
without tasting flesh; that he can live on a mixed diet; that he can
adopt a great many plans of eating and live in health and comfort on
nearly all of them, provided he does not deprive himself of the natural
salts and gets some protein; and finally and most important, that
moderation is the chief factor in keeping well, for the best foods
produce disease in time if taken in excess.</p>

<p id="id00430" class="calibre1">Those who object to flesh, dairy products, cereals, tubers, legumes,
refined sugars, fruits or vegetables, should do without the class which
they find objectionable, for it is easy to substitute from other
classes. Eggs, milk or legumes may be taken in place of flesh foods. The
salts contained in fruits may be obtained from vegetables. The starch,
which is the chief ingredient of cereals, is easily obtained from tubers
and legumes; fats and sugars will take its place. Commercial sugar is
not a necessity. The force and heat derived from it can be obtained from
starches and fats.</p>

<p id="id00431" class="calibre1">Outside of milk in infancy, there is not a single indispensable food.
Some people have peculiarities which prevent them from eating certain
foods, such as pork, eggs, milk and strawberries, but with these
exceptions a healthy person can eat any food he pleases, provided he is
moderate. We eat too much flesh, sugar and starch and we suffer for it.
This does not prove that these foods are harmful, but that overeating is.</p>

<p id="id00432" class="calibre1">Sometimes the food question becomes a very trying one in the home. One
individual has learned the fact that good results are obtained by using
good sense and judgment in combining and consuming food, and he tries to
force others to do as he does. This is unfortunate, for most people
object to such actions, and though the intention is good, it
accomplishes nothing, but prejudices others against sensible living. The
best way is to do right yourself and let others sin against themselves
and suffer until they are weary. Then, seeing how you got out of your
trouble, perhaps they will come to you and accept what you have to
offer.</p>

<p id="id00433" class="calibre1">The attempt to force people to be good or to be healthy is merely wasted
effort.</p>

<p id="id00434" class="calibre1">The chapter devoted to Menus gives definite information regarding the
proper manner in which to combine foods and arrange meals. Such
information is also given in treating of the different classes of food.</p>

<div class="calibre10"></div><div class="calibre10"></div><h2 id="id00435" class="calibre11">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h5 id="id00436" class="calibre5">WHEN TO EAT.</h5>

<p id="id00437" class="calibre1">Three meals a day is the common plan. This is a matter of habit. Three
meals a day are sufficient and should not be exceeded by man, woman or
child. Lunching or "piecing" should never be indulged in. Children who
are fed on plain, nutritious foods that contain the necessary food
elements do not need lunches. Lunching is also a matter of habit, and we
can safely say that it is a bad habit.</p>

<p id="id00438" class="calibre1">If three meals a day are taken, two should be light. He who wishes to
work efficiently can not eat three hearty meals a day. If it is brain
work, the digestive organs will take so much of the blood supply that an
insufficient amount of blood will be left to nourish the brain. The
worker feels the lack of energy. He is not inclined to do thorough work,
that is, to go to the root of matters, and he therefore does indifferent
work. One rule to which there is no exception is that the brain can not
do its best when the digestive organs are working hard. If there is a
piece of work to be done or a problem to be solved that requires all of
one's powers it is best to tackle it with an empty stomach, or after a
very light meal.</p>

<p id="id00439" class="calibre1">If the work is physical, it is not necessary to draw the line so fine.
But it is well to remember that hard physical work prevents digestion.
All experiments prove this. So if the labor is very trying, the eating
should be light. Those who eat much because they work hard will soon
wear themselves out, for hard work retards digestion, and with weakened
digestion the more that is eaten, the less nourishment is extracted from
it. Those who labor hard should take a light breakfast and the same kind
of a noon meal. After the day's work is done, take a hearty meal. Those
who perform hard physical labor, as well as those who work chiefly with
their brains, should relax a while after the noon meal. A nap lasting
ten to twenty minutes is very beneficial, but not necessary if
relaxation is taken.</p>

<p id="id00440" class="calibre1">During sleep the activities of the body slow down. Most people who take
a heavy meal and retire immediately thereafter feel uncomfortable when
they wake in the morning. The reason is that the food did not digest
well. It is always well to remain up at least two hours after eating a
hearty meal.</p>

<p id="id00441" class="calibre1">Most people would be better off if they took but two meals a day. Those
who have sedentary occupations need less fuel than manual laborers, and
could get along very well on two meals a day. However, if moderation is
practiced, no harm will come from eating three times a day.</p>

<p id="id00442" class="calibre1">In olden times many people lived on one meal a day. Some do so today and
get along very well. It is easy to get plenty of nourishment from one
meal, and it has the advantage of not taking so much time. Most of us
spend too much time preparing for meals and eating. Once when it was
rather inconvenient to get more meals, I lived for ten months on one
meal a day. I enjoyed my food very much and was well nourished. For
twelve years I have lived on two meals a day, one of them often
consisting of nothing but some juicy fruit. Many others do likewise, not
because they are prejudiced against three meals per day, but they find
the two meal plan more convenient and very satisfactory.</p>

<p id="id00443" class="calibre1">Meat, potatoes and bread, with other foods, three times a day is a
common combination. No ordinary mortal can live in health on such a
diet. Such feeding results in discomfort and disease, and unless it is
changed, in premature aging and death. The body needs only a certain
amount of material. Sufficient can be taken in two meals. If three meals
is the custom less food at a meal should be eaten. However, the general
rule is that those who eat three meals per day eat fully as large ones
as those who take only two.</p>

<p id="id00444" class="calibre1">As a rule, the meal times should be regular. We need a certain amount of
nourishment, and it is well to take it regularly. This reduces friction,
and is conducive to health, for the body is easily taught to fall into
habits of regularity and works best when these are observed.</p>

<p id="id00445" class="calibre1">There should be a period of at least four and one-half to five hours
between meals. It takes that long for the body to get a meal out of the
way. Stomach digestion is but the beginning of the process, and this
alone requires from two to five hours.</p>

<p id="id00446" class="calibre1">On the two-meal plan it makes very little difference whether the
breakfast or the lunch is omitted. After going without breakfast for a
week or two, one does not miss it. Miss the meal that it is the most
troublesome to get. Dr. Dewey revived interest in the no-breakfast plan
in this country. He considered it very beneficial. The doctor did not
give credit where credit is due, for he insisted on going without
breakfast. Omitting lunch or dinner accomplishes the same thing. He got
his beneficial results from reducing the number of meals, and
consequently the amount of food taken, but it is immaterial which meal
is omitted.</p>

<p id="id00447" class="calibre1">Heavy breakfasts are very common in England and in our country. On the
European continent they do not eat so much for breakfast, a cup of
coffee and one roll being a favorite morning meal there. To eat nothing
in the morning is better than to take coffee and rolls. To eat enough to
steal one's brain away is a poor way to begin the day. Much better work
could be done on some fruit or a glass of milk, or some cereal and
butter than on eggs, steak potatoes, hot bread and coffee, which is not
an uncommon breakfast.</p>

<p id="id00448" class="calibre1">When we consider the best time to eat, we come back to our old friend,
moderation, and find that it is the best solution of the question, for
if the meals are moderate we may with benefit take three meals a day,
but no more, for there is not time enough during the day to digest more
than three meals. However, it is not necessary to eat three times a day.</p>

<div class="calibre10"></div><div class="calibre10"></div><h2 id="id00449" class="calibre11">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h5 id="id00450" class="calibre5">HOW TO EAT.</h5>

<p id="id00451" class="calibre1">It seems that all of us ought to know how to eat, for we have much
practice; yet the individuals who know the true principles of nourishing
the body are comparatively few. Very few healers are able to give full
and explicit directions on this important subject. Some can give partial
instructions, but we need a full working knowledge.</p>

<p id="id00452" class="calibre1">In one period of our racial history there were times when it was
difficult to obtain food, as it is now among some savage people. Then it
was without doubt customary to gorge, as it is among some savages now
when they get a plenteous supply of food, especially of flesh food. Even
among so-called civilized people, the distribution of food is so uneven
that some are in want somewhere, nearly all the time. In parts of
Russia, we are informed, the peasants go into a state of
semi-hibernation during part of the winter, living on very small
quantities of inferior food.</p>

<p id="id00453" class="calibre1">With rapid transportation and the extensive use of power-propelled
machinery, famine should be unheard of in civilized countries. In our
land there is a sufficient quantity of food and people seldom suffer
because they have not enough, but considerable suffering is due to
excessive intake and to poor quality of food. Weight for weight, white
bread is not as valuable as whole wheat bread, though it contains as
much starch. Measure for measure, boiled milk is inferior as a food to
untreated milk, either fresh or clabbered. Such facts make it necessary
for us to know how to eat.</p>

<p id="id00454" class="calibre1">The correct principles of taking nourishment to the best advantage have
been fairly well known for a long time, and perhaps they have been fully
discussed years ago by some author, but so far as I know Dr. E. H. Dewey
is the first one who grouped them and gave them the prominence they
deserve. He employed many pages in explaining clearly and forcibly these
principles, which can be briefly stated as follows:</p>

<p id="id00455" class="calibre1">First, Be guided by the appetite in eating. Eat only when there is
hunger.</p>

<p id="id00456" class="calibre1">Second, During acute illness fast, that is, live on water.</p>

<p id="id00457" class="calibre1">Third, Be moderate in eating.</p>

<p id="id00458" class="calibre1">Fourth, Masticate your food thoroughly.</p>

<p id="id00459" class="calibre1">Dr. J. H. Tilden teaches his patients the same in these words:</p>

<p id="id00460" class="calibre1">"Never eat when you feel badly.</p>

<p id="id00461" class="calibre1">"Never eat when you have no desire.</p>

<p id="id00462" class="calibre1">"Do not overeat.</p>

<p id="id00463" class="calibre1">"Thoroughly masticate and insalivate all your food."</p>

<p id="id00464" class="calibre1">Because these true dietetic principles are so important, probably being
the most valuable information given in this book, let us give them
enough consideration to fix them in the mind. They should be a part of
every child's education. They should be so thoroughly learned that they
become second nature, for if they are observed disease is practically
impossible. Accidents may happen, but no serious disease can develop and
certainly none of a chronic nature if these rules are observed, provided
the individual gives himself half a chance in other ways. When the
eating is correct, it is difficult to fall into bad habits mentally.
Correct eating is a powerful aid to health. Health tends to produce
proper thinking, which in turn leads the individual to proper acting.</p>

<p id="id00465" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">First, Eat only when there is hunger</i>: Hunger is of two kinds, normal
and abnormal. The real or normal hunger was given us by nature to make
us active enough to get food. If it were not for hunger, there would be
no special incentive for the young to partake of nourishment and
consequently many would die comfortably of starvation, perhaps enough to
endanger the life of the race. Normal hunger asks for food, but no
special kind of food. It is satisfied with anything that is clean and
nourishing. It is strong enough to make a decided demand for food, but
if there is no food to be had it will be satisfied for the time being
with a glass of water and will cause no great inconvenience.</p>

<p id="id00466" class="calibre1">Abnormal hunger is entirely different. It is a very insistent craving
and if it is not satisfied it produces bodily discomfort, perhaps
headache. The gnawing remains and gives the victim no rest. Very often
it must be pampered. It calls for beefsteak, or toast and tea, or
sweets, or some other special food. If not satisfied the results may be
nervousness, weakness or headache or some other disagreeable symptom.</p>

<p id="id00467" class="calibre1">When missing a meal or two brings discomfort, it is always a sign of a
degenerating or degenerated body. A healthy person can go a day without
food without any inconvenience. He feels a keen desire for food at meal
times, but as soon as he has made up his mind that he is unable to get
it or that he is not going to take any the hunger leaves. Normal hunger
is a servant. Abnormal hunger is a hard master.</p>

<p id="id00468" class="calibre1">A person in good condition does not get weak from missing a few meals.
One in poor physical condition does, although this is more apparent than
real. In the abnormal person a part of the food is used as nourishment,
but on account of the poor working of the digestive organs, a part
decomposes and this acts as an irritant or a stimulant. The greater the
irritation the more food is demanded. The temporary stimulation is
followed by depression and then the sufferer is wretched. This
depression is relieved by more food. Please note that it is relieved,
not cured. The relief is only temporary.</p>

<p id="id00469" class="calibre1">All food stimulates, but only slightly. It is when the food decomposes
that it becomes stimulating enough to cause trouble. It is well to
remember that considerable alcoholic fermentation can take place in an
abused alimentary tract. The stimulation obtained from too much food is
very much like the stimulation derived from alcohol, tobacco or
morphine. At first there is a feeling of well-being, which is followed
by a miserable feeling of depression that demands food, alcohol, tobacco
or morphine for relief, as the case may be, and no matter which habit is
obtaining mastery, to indulge it is courting disaster. When a habit
begins to assert itself strongly, break it, for later on it will be very
difficult, so difficult that most people lack the will power to overcome
it.</p>

<p id="id00470" class="calibre1">If there is abnormal hunger, reduce the food intake. Instead of eating
five or six times a day, reduce the meals to two or three. It is quite
common for such people to take lunches, which may consist of candies,
ice cream, cakes, milk or buttermilk and various other things which most
people do not look upon as real food. Take two or three meals a day, and
let a large part of them be fresh vegetables and fresh fruits. Eat in
moderation and the troublesome abnormal hunger will soon leave. By
indulging it you increase it.</p>

<p id="id00471" class="calibre1">Many people get into trouble because they believe that they have to have
protein, starch and fat at every meal. This is not necessary, for the
blood takes up enough nourishment to last for quite a while. A supply of
the various food elements once a day is sufficient, which means that
protein needs be taken but once a day, starch once a day and fat once a
day. Starch and fat serve the same purpose and one can be replaced by
the other.</p>

<p id="id00472" class="calibre1">Cultivate a normal hunger, then fix two or three periods in which to
take nourishment, and partake of nothing but water outside of these
periods. If there is no desire for food when meal time comes, eat
nothing, but drink all the water desired and wait until next meal time.</p>

<p id="id00473" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Second, During acute illness fast</i>: This is so obviously correct that
we should expect every normal individual to be guided by it. Even the
lower animals know this and act accordingly.</p>

<p id="id00474" class="calibre1">According to this rule we should go without food when ill, but to do so
is contrary to the teachings of medical men. They teach that when people
are ill there is much waste, which is true, and that for this reason it
is necessary to partake of a generous amount of nourishing food, so they
give milk, broth, meat, toast and other foods, together with stimulants.
Feeding during illness would be all right if the body could take care of
the food, which it can not. In all severe diseases digestion is almost
or quite at a standstill and the food given under the circumstances
decomposes in the alimentary tract and furnishes additional poison for
the system to excrete. Food under the circumstances is a detriment and a
burden to the body. In fevers, the temperature goes up after feeding.
This shows that more poison has entered the blood. In fevers little or
none of the digestive fluids is secreted, but the alimentary tract is so
warm that the food decomposes quickly. Feeding during acute attacks of
disease is one of the most serious and fatal of errors. There is an
aversion to food, which is nature's request that none be taken.</p>

<p id="id00475" class="calibre1">When an animal becomes seriously ill, it wants to fast, and does so
unless man interferes. Here we could with advantage do as the animals
do. Nature made no mistake when she took hunger away in acute diseases,
and if we disregard her desires, we invariably suffer for it.</p>

<p id="id00476" class="calibre1">We should make it a rule to take no food, either liquid or solid, during
acute disease.</p>

<p id="id00477" class="calibre1">Those who have had no opportunity to watch the rapidity with which
people recover from serious illness may take the ground that sick people
would starve to death if they were to be treated thus, for some of these
acute diseases last a long time. Typhoid fever, for instance,
occasionally lasts two or three months. It never lasts that long when
treated by natural means, and it is very mild, as a rule. The fever will
be gone in from seven to fourteen days in the vast majority of cases,
and then feeding can be resumed.</p>

<p id="id00478" class="calibre1">Chronic disease is often due to neglected acute disease, at other times
to the building of abnormality through errors of life which have not
resulted in acute troubles. While acquiring chronic disease, the
individual may be fairly comfortable, but he is never up to par. Most
chronic diseases can be cured quickly by taking a fast, but usually it
is not necessary to take a complete fast. The desire for food is not
generally absent and there is usually fair power to digest. One of the
most satisfactory methods, if not the most satisfactory one, of treating
chronic disease is to reduce the food intake, and instead of giving so
much of the concentrated staples, feed more of the succulent vegetables
and the fresh fruits, cooked and raw, using but small quantities of
flesh, bread, potatoes and sugar. This gives the body a chance to throw
off impurities. There are always many impurities in a deranged body.</p>

<p id="id00479" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Third, Be moderate in your eating</i>: This is often very difficult, for
most people do not know what moderation is. In infancy the too frequent
feeding and the overfeeding begin. The common belief that infants must
be fed every two hours, or oftener, is acted upon. The result is that
the child soon loses its normal hunger, which is replaced by abnormal
hunger. When food is long withheld it begins to fret. The mother again
feeds and there is peace for an hour or so. When mothers learn to feed
their children three times a day and no more there will be a great
decrease in infant ills and a falling off in the infant mortality. The
healthiest children I have seen are fed but three times a day. They
become used to it and expect no more.</p>

<p id="id00480" class="calibre1">Another thing that makes it difficult to be moderate is impoverishing
the food through refinement and poor cooking. These processes take away
a great part of the mineral salts which are present in foods in organic
form. These salts can not be replaced by table salt, for sodium chloride
is but one of many salts that the body needs and an excess of table salt
does not make up for a deficiency in the others.</p>

<p id="id00481" class="calibre1">Children fed on refined, impoverished foods are not satisfied with a
reasonable amount. There is something lacking and this makes itself
known in cravings, which demand more food than is needed to nourish. I
have noticed many times that children are satisfied with less of whole
wheat bread than of white bread, and that the brown unpolished rice
satisfies them more quickly and completely than the polished rice. In
other words, depriving the foods of their salts is one of the factors
that leads to overeating.</p>

<p id="id00482" class="calibre1">Simplicity is a great aid to moderation. It is also necessary to
exercise the conservative measure, self-control. Some writers suggest to
eat all that is desired and then fast at various intervals to overcome
the effects of overeating. In other words, they advise to eat enough to
become diseased and then fast to cure the trouble. This is better than
to continue the eating when the evil results of an excessive food intake
make themselves known, but it does not bring the best results. Such
people have their spells of sickness, which are unnecessary. If they
stop eating as soon as the disease makes itself known, it does not last
long. By exercising self-control sickness will be warded off. By using
will power daily it grows stronger and those who force themselves to be
moderate at first, are in time rewarded by having moderation become
second nature.</p>

<p id="id00483" class="calibre1">People should always stop eating before they are full. Those who eat
until they are uncomfortable are gluttons. They should be classed with
drunkards and drug addicts.</p>

<p id="id00484" class="calibre1">If discomfort follows a meal it is a sign of overeating. It would be
well to read this in connection with the chapter that treats of
overeating.</p>

<p id="id00485" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Fourth, Thoroughly masticate all food</i>: Horace Fletcher has written a
very enthusiastic book on this subject. Enthusiasm is apt to lead one
astray, and even if thorough mastication will not do all that Mr.
Fletcher believed, it is very important, and we owe Mr. Fletcher thanks
for calling our attention to the subject forcibly.</p>

<p id="id00486" class="calibre1">Thorough mastication partially checks overeating.</p>

<p id="id00487" class="calibre1">Our foods have to be finely divided and subdivided or they can not be
thoroughly acted upon by the digestive juices. The stomach is well
muscled and churns the food about, helping to comminute it, but it can
not take the place of the teeth. All foods should be thoroughly
masticated. While the mastication is going on the saliva becomes mixed
with the food. In the saliva is the ptyalin, which begins to digest the
starch. Starch that is well masticated is not so liable to ferment as
that which gets scant attention in the mouth. Starches and nuts need the
most thorough mastication. If thorough mastication were the rule, meat
gluttons would be fewer, for when flesh is well chewed large quantities
cause nausea.</p>

<p id="id00488" class="calibre1">Milk digests best when it is rolled around in the mouth long enough to
be mixed with saliva. To treat milk as a drink is a mistake, for it is a
very nourishing food.</p>

<p id="id00489" class="calibre1">All kinds of nuts must be well masticated. If they are not they can not
be well digested, for the digestive organs are unable to break down big
pieces of the hard nut meats.</p>

<p id="id00490" class="calibre1">The succulent vegetables contain considerable starch. If mastication is
slighted they often ferment enough to produce considerable gas.</p>

<p id="id00491" class="calibre1">Fruits are generally eaten too rapidly, and therefore often produce bad
results. Even green fruits can be eaten with impunity if they are very
thoroughly masticated.</p>

<p id="id00492" class="calibre1">Those who are fond enough of liquors to take an excess should sip their
alcoholic beverages very slowly, tasting every drop before swallowing.
This would decrease their consumption of liquor greatly.</p>

<p id="id00493" class="calibre1">Even water should not be gulped down. It should be taken rather slowly,
especially on hot days. During hot weather many drink too much water.
This tendency can usually be overcome by avoiding iced water and by
drinking slowly.</p>

<p id="id00494" class="calibre1">These four rules should be a part of your vital knowledge. If you forget
everything else in this book, please remember them and try to put them
into practice:</p>

<h5 id="id00497" class="calibre5">CLASSIFICATION OF FOODS.</h5>

<p id="id00498" class="calibre1">Food is anything which, when taken into the body under proper
conditions, is broken down and taken into the blood and utilized for
building, repairing or the production of heat or energy.</p>

<p id="id00499" class="calibre1">There are various forms of foods, which can be divided into two classes:
First, nitrogenous foods or proteins. Second, carbonaceous, foods, under
which caption come the sugars, starches and fats. Salts and water are
not usually classified as foods, though they should be, for life is
impossible without either.</p>

<p id="id00500" class="calibre1">The chief proteins are: First, the albuminoids, which are represented by
the albumin in eggs, the casein in milk and cheese, the myosin of muscle
and the gluten of wheat. Second, the gelatinoids, which are represented
by the ossein of bones, which can be made into glue, and the collogen of
tendons. Third, nitrogen extractives, which are the chief ingredients in
beef tea. They are easily removed from flesh by soaking it while raw in
cold water. They are rich in flavor and are stimulating. They have
absolutely no food value. Beef tea, and other related extracts, are not
foods. They are stimulants. In truth they are of no value, and those who
purchase such preparations pay a high price and get nothing in return.</p>

<p id="id00501" class="calibre1">The sugars and starches are grouped under the name of carbohydrates,
which means that they are a combination of water and carbon. There are
various forms of sugar. About 4 per cent of milk is milk sugar, which
agrees better with the young than any other kind of sugar. It is not so
soluble in water as the refined cane sugar, and therefore not so sweet,
but it is fully as nourishing. Honey is a mixture of various kinds of
sugars. Cane sugar is taken principally from sugar beets and sugar cane.
There is no chemical difference between the products of canes and beets.
Sugars can not be utilized by the blood until it has changed them into
other forms of sugar.</p>

<p id="id00502" class="calibre1">The use of sugar is rapidly increasing. Several centuries ago it was
used as a drug. It was doubtless as effective as a curing agent as our
drugs are today. Until within the last sixty or seventy years it has not
been used as a staple food. Now it is one of our chief foods. Not so
very long ago but ten pounds of sugar per capita were used annually, but
now we are consuming about ninety pounds each annually, that is, about
four ounces per day. Many people look upon sugar as a flavoring, which
it is in a measure, but it is also one of our most concentrated foods.</p>

<p id="id00503" class="calibre1">That this great consumption of sugar is harmful there is no doubt.
Physicians who practiced when the use of sugar was increasing very
rapidly called attention to the increasing decay of teeth. Sugar, as it
appears upon the table is an unsatisfied compound. It does not appear in
concentrated form in nature, but mixed with vegetable and mineral
matters, and when the pure sugar is put into solution it seeks these
matters. It is especially hungry for calcium and will therefore rob the
bones, the teeth and the blood of this important salt, if it can not be
had otherwise. The most noticeable effect is the decay of the teeth.</p>

<p id="id00504" class="calibre1">I have read considerable literature of late blaming sugar for producing
many diseases, among them tuberculosis and cancer. Improper feeding is
the chief cause of these diseases, but to blame sugar for all ills of
that kind is far from arriving at the truth. Cancer and tuberculosis
killed vast numbers of people before sugar was used as a staple. If we
wish to get at the root of any trouble, it is necessary for us to bury
our prejudices and be broad minded.</p>

<p id="id00505" class="calibre1">People who eat much sugar should also partake liberally of fresh raw
fruits and vegetables, in order to supply the salts in which sugar is
deficient. Lump sugar is practically pure, and therefore a poorer
article of diet than any other form of sugar, for man can not live on
carbon without salts.</p>

<p id="id00506" class="calibre1">Grape sugar and fruit sugar are the same chemically. Another name for
them is dextrose, and in the form of dextrose sugar is ready to be taken
up by the blood.</p>

<p id="id00507" class="calibre1">Children like sweets, but it is just as easy to give them the sweet
fruits, such as good figs, dates and raisins, as it is to give them
commercial sugar and candy, and it is much better for their health.
Children who get used to the sweet fruits do not care very much for
candies. The sugar in these fruits is not concentrated enough to be an
irritant and it contains the salts needed by the body. Hence it does not
rob the body of any of its necessary constituents. Because the fruit
sugar, taken in fruit form, is not so concentrated and irritating as the
common sugar, the child is satisfied with less.</p>

<p id="id00508" class="calibre1">Sugar is an irritant of the mucous membrane and therefore stimulates the
appetite. This is true only when it is taken in excess in its artificial
form, and it does not matter whether it is sugar, jelly or jam. For this
reason jellies and jams should be used sparingly, because it is not
necessary to stimulate the appetite. Those who resort to stimulation
overeat. When much sugar is taken, it not only irritates the stomach,
but it even inflames this organ.</p>

<p id="id00509" class="calibre1">Sugar is a preservative, and like all other preservatives it delays
digestion, if taken in great quantities, and four ounces per day make a
great quantity. The digestive organs rebel if they are given as much of
sugar as they will tolerate of starch. When taken in excess sugar
ferments easily, producing much gas, which is followed by serious
results.</p>

<p id="id00510" class="calibre1">Sugar is changed into forms less sweet by acids and heat. The ferment
invertin also acts upon sugars.</p>

<p id="id00511" class="calibre1">Sugar is a valuable food, but we are abusing it, and therefore it is
doing us physical harm. The quantity should be reduced, and families who
are using four ounces per person per day, as statistics indicate that
most are doing, should reduce the intake to about one-third of this
amount. It would be well to take as much of the sugar as possible in the
form of sweet fruits.</p>

<p id="id00512" class="calibre1">It is a fact that sugar is easy to digest and that one can soon get
energy from it, but feeding is not merely a question of giving
digestible aliments, but a question of using foods that are beneficial
in the long run. The moderate use of this food is all right, but excess
is always bad. Starches need more change than sugars before they can be
absorbed by the blood, but they give better results. Chemically there is
but small difference between starch and sugar. The starch must be
changed into dextrose, a form of sugar, before it can be utilized by the
body.</p>

<p id="id00513" class="calibre1">The human body contains a small amount of a substance called glycogen,
which is an animal starch or sugar. This glycogen is burned. Sugar is a
force food. It combines with oxygen and gives heat and energy. The waste
product is carbonic acid gas, which is carried by the blood to the lungs
and then exhaled.</p>

<p id="id00514" class="calibre1">Honey and maple sugar are good foods, but overconsumption is harmful.</p>

<p id="id00515" class="calibre1">Sugar eating is largely a habit. Because the sugar has so much of the
life and so many of the necessary salts removed in its refinement it is
a good food only when taken in small quantities. Nature demands of us
that we do not get too refined in our habits, for excessive refinement
is followed by decay. It is easy to overcome the tendency to overeat of
sugar.</p>

<p id="id00516" class="calibre1">Some spoil the most delicious watermelon by heaping sugar or salt, or
both, upon it. In this way the flavor is lost. There is not a raw fruit
on the market which is as finely flavored after it has been sugared as
it was before. True, those who have ruined their sense of taste object
to the tartness and natural acidity of various foods, but they are not
judges and can not be until they have regained a normal taste, which can
only be done by living on natural foods for a while.</p>

<p id="id00517" class="calibre1">Fats are obtained most plentifully from nuts, legumes, dairy products
and animal foods. They are the most concentrated of all foods, yielding
over twice the amount of heat or energy that we can obtain from the same
weight of pure sugar, starch or protein. Many who think they are
moderate eaters consume enough butter to put them in the glutton class.</p>

<p id="id00518" class="calibre1">Salts are present in all natural foods of which we partake.</p>

<p id="id00519" class="calibre1">Water is indispensable, for the body has to have fluids in order to
perform its functions.</p>

<p id="id00520" class="calibre1">Foods are burned in the body. They are valuable in proportion to the
completeness with which they are digested and assimilated and the ease
with which this process is accomplished. It takes energy to digest food
and if the food is very indigestible it takes too much energy.</p>

<p id="id00521" class="calibre1">The following remarks on digestibility are according to the best
knowledge we have on the subject:</p>

<p id="id00522" class="calibre1">As a general rule, the protein of meat and fish is more completely and
more quickly digested than the protein in vegetable foods. The reason is
that the vegetable protein is found in cells which are protected by the
indigestible cellulose which covers each cell. This covering is not
always broken and then the digestive juices are practically powerless.</p>

<p id="id00523" class="calibre1">The legumes, which are rich in protein, are comparatively hard to
digest. If properly prepared and eaten, they give little or no trouble,
but they are generally cooked soft and the mastication is slighted. The
result is fermentation. Beans, peas and lentils should be very well
chewed, and eaten in moderation, for they are rich both in starch and
protein.</p>
