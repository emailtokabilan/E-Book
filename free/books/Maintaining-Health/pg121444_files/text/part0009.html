    The weakling has been compelled to be careful. Habits of moderation grew
upon him in youth, and his health has improved as he has advanced in
years. He may never be strong, but great physical strength is not
essential to health. Thus the strong often perish and the weak survive.
If both classes lived with equal care the strong would outlive and
outwork the weak every time.</p>

<p id="id01617" class="calibre1">It is necessary to give the skin some care if continued good health is
desired during the latter part of life. The skin has a tendency to grow
hard, which should not be allowed. It will always remain soft if it is
properly cared for. When our ancestors roved forests and plains with
scarcely any attire, the skin exposed to the rain and the sunshine,
there was no need to give it special care. It served its purpose of
protecting their bodies and was exercised through its immediate contact
with the elements in all kinds of weather. Now the skin has little
opportunity to exercise its protective function and the result is that
it is not as active as it should be. The skin must be active to rid
itself of the waste that the blood-vessels leave with it. The best
exercise for this important organ is rubbing. The whole body should be
rubbed every day and it would be well to do this twice a day. An
occasional olive oil rub is also good. The rubbings make the body
hardier. They also help to keep the circulation active and the skin
smooth and soft. The blood is brought near the surface. The tendency as
we grow older is for the circulation to grow less and less near the
surface and in the extremities. This is slow death.</p>

<p id="id01618" class="calibre1">The daily rub is more important than the daily bath. If we have enough
rubbing very little bathing is necessary, for an active skin cleans
itself.</p>

<p id="id01619" class="calibre1">There are many men who have lived in the conventional way until the age
of forty, fifty or sixty. They have been healthy, which means that they
have been able to work most of the time, but have had their share of
ills, which have incapacitated them for work or business at various
times. They find after reaching a certain age that they are surely going
down hill physically and that they are not as active mentally as
previously. The question is, can anything be done under the
circumstances? Very few of these people are in such a bad physical state
that death is inevitable within the next few years. If they seek the
right advice and follow it, they can generally continue to live in
improved health for thirty to sixty years more.</p>

<p id="id01620" class="calibre1">A celebrated case in point is that of Louis Cornaro, an Italian, who
died in the year 1566 at the age of one hundred and two years. In his
youth he was very indiscreet and dissipated. He lived riotously until he
was forty years old, and then he found himself in such poor physical
condition that it was only a question of a few months until the end
would come. He had everything to make life worth living, except health,
so he decided to attempt to regain health and prolong his life. He quit
his old life, began to live simply and instead of being a waster he
became a useful citizen. We are unable to get much definite information
about his habits from what he wrote but we learn that he reduced the
quantity of food taken and used fewer varieties. Also, he drank
sparingly of wine. He did not have any definite ideas regarding diet
except that it is best to eat moderately and avoid the foods that
disagree with one. In his own words: "Little by little I began to draw
myself away from my disorderly life, and, little by little, to embrace
the orderly one. In this manner I gave myself up to the temperate life,
which has not since been wearisome to me; although, on account of the
weakness of my constitution, I was compelled to be extremely careful
with regard to the quality and quantity of my food and drink. However,
those persons who are blessed with strong constitutions may make use of
many other kinds and qualities of food and drink, and partake of them,
in greater quantities, than I do; so that, even though the life they
follow be the temperate one, it need not be as strict as mine, but much
freer."</p>

<p id="id01621" class="calibre1">These sentences were written fifty or sixty years after he changed his
mode of life, and show how well Mr. Cornaro realized the important fact
that all people need not be treated alike. They also show that after
making the change, Mr. Cornaro did not find it difficult to live simply
enough to enjoy health. In nearly every instance it is temporarily
disagreeable to forsake the path that is leading to death and take the
one that leads to life, but after one gets used to the new way, it
appears more beautiful and is more pleasant than the old.</p>

<p id="id01622" class="calibre1">If Cornaro had died at forty, as nearly every person situated as he was
would have done, his life would have been a total loss. A few of those
who were his boon companions and dissipated with him would have thought
of him for a few years and regretted his early passing, for "he was a
jolly good fellow." He lived a useful life, for over sixty years
thereafter, and has left us in his debt for his beautiful exhortations
to be temperate.</p>

<p id="id01623" class="calibre1">Many of the physical wrecks we meet, who will probably live from a few
months to a few years more, if they continue in the old way, are in the
same boat as Mr. Cornaro was at forty. They have had enough experience
to begin to do good work, to be of some benefit to humanity. Instead of
living and giving the world their best, they die. The world has had to
educate these people, and it is expensive. Instead of living on and
doing their work, they leave us when they ought to begin to repay us for
what we have done for them. They are quitters.</p>

<p id="id01624" class="calibre1">Suppose Andrew Carnegie had died at the time he sold out his steel
business. To most people he would have left an unsavory memory, for
though we should have considered him successful from the business
standpoint, many of us would say that the means were not justified by
the end. However, Mr. Carnegie has spent many years since in furthering
the cause of the spread of knowledge and in working for universal peace.
Perhaps when Carnegie, the man of business, is well nigh forgotten,
Carnegie, the educator, will be held in tender and thankful memory. He
is now influencing the times for good and this influence will go down
the ages.</p>

<p id="id01625" class="calibre1">A man has no right to say that he is weary of life and that he wants to
die. The race has a claim on him. We learn through our mistakes. The
race in general has to pay and suffer for every individual's education.
When a man has acquired a measure of wisdom through experience, we have
a right to claim it as our own.</p>

<p id="id01626" class="calibre1">Many men are wise in their own lines, but they have been so busy
attending to the affairs that brought them success that they have
omitted to learn how to have health. These people owe it to themselves
and to humanity to take enough time to learn how to live so that they
can work in health. The better the health the finer their product.
Health and efficiency go hand in hand.</p>

<p id="id01627" class="calibre1">What is a man to do when he has reached middle age and finds himself
degenerating? A man ought to know how to live at forty, but if he does
not he should immediately learn. It may be true that "a man is a fool or
a physician at forty," yet there is time and if a man lacks wisdom at
forty he should immediately acquire some. Such an individual should get
the best health adviser possible, avoiding any man who would have him
take drugs. What he needs is not medicine, but to learn how to live. I
am confident that the careful reader will find enough knowledge in this
book to give him the key to the situation.</p>

<p id="id01628" class="calibre1">If the sufferer uses narcotics and stimulants, they must be stopped
immediately. Even the least harmful of these, such as beer and light
wine, should be avoided until good health has been won. These beverages
need never be used. If they are taken rarely and in moderation they do
no harm.</p>

<p id="id01629" class="calibre1">In every case that has come under my observation it has been necessary
to simplify the food intake, that is, to reduce the quantity and the
number of articles of food taken at each meal, also to simplify the
cooking. The result is that the individual gets less food, but it is of
better quality, for the conventional cooking spoils much of the food.</p>

<p id="id01630" class="calibre1">Most of these men neglect to exercise. It is necessary to be active and
in the open, also to take good care of that important organ, the skin.
Constipation is common, and it is a very annoying symptom, which
disappears in time under proper living. The absorption of poisons from a
constipated lower bowel is one of the factors that causes premature
aging. When the constipation is overcome there are a feeling of physical
well-being and a mental clearness which are impossible in the presence
of constipation.</p>

<p id="id01631" class="calibre1">The treatment of such a condition is very much the same as the treatment
of catarrh or any other curable disease, that is, find the errors of
living and correct them.</p>

<p id="id01632" class="calibre1">It is really surprising how little food people need after they are fifty
or sixty years old. If such people eat enough to be well nourished, but
not enough to produce any bad feelings there will be no disease. People
who die from disease are physical failures, for the natural end does not
come in a physical upheaval. Those who live as they should will pass
away without any pain. The organism simply grows weary and goes into the
last sleep.</p>

<p id="id01633" class="calibre1">There are people who say that there needs be no physical death. Harry
Gaze wrote an entertaining book on the subject some years ago and gave
lectures in this country. It will not convince the average student of
nature that people can live forever, for in nature there is constant
change. The order of life is birth, development, reproduction, decline
and death. It is not likely that man is an exception.</p>

<p id="id01634" class="calibre1">It is believed that in olden times men were larger and lived longer than
they do today. There is not much foundation for such a belief to rest
upon, except in a few cases. The last census shows that there are
several thousand centennarians in the United States. In the Technical
World for March, 1914, appeared an article by Byron C. Utecht, entitled,
"When is Man Old?" This magazine is careful in gathering its facts. I
shall quote a few paragraphs:</p>

<p id="id01635" class="calibre1">"Abraham Wilcox, of Fort Worth, Texas, is one hundred and twelve years
old, but he takes keen enjoyment in life. He walks two miles or more
every day as a constitutional and, occasionally, he even takes a small
glass of beer. He looks forward with all the enthusiasm of a boy to a
visit to the Panama-Pacific Exposition in 1915. Mr. Wilcox reads the
newspapers every day and is interested in everything about him, from the
food being prepared for his dinner to the latest feats by aeroplanes.
This aged man looks forty or fifty years younger than he really is. His
skin is white but not deeply lined. His vision is excellent and he walks
nearly erect. Thirty years ago he gave up smoking, as his doctors warned
him he was near death from old age and that the use of tobacco would
only hasten the end."</p>

<p id="id01636" class="calibre1">"In the Ozark Mountains of Marion County, Arkansas, just across the
Missouri line, lives Mrs. Elmyra Wagoner. She, too, is one hundred and
twelve years old. There are a thousand wrinkles in her face and she
looks her age, but in her actions she is sixty. Up until a very few
years ago, when still past the hundred-year mark, Mrs. Wagoner kept a
large garden and was able to work in the fields. While she has given up
outdoor work, she is still active. On inclement days she sits by the
fireplace in her mountain home and spins. On pleasant days she may be
found walking about the yard. Recently her great-great-granddaughter was
married at Protein, Missouri, six miles from the Wagoner home. This
woman of one hundred and twelve years walked to the wedding, enjoyed it,
and then walked back home, a distance that would tire many persons half
that age. There are scores of persons at Protein who vouch for this and
they tell of similar feats by Mrs. Wagoner showing remarkable physical
power.</p>

<p id="id01637" class="calibre1">"Asked to give the causes of her longevity, the aged woman smiled and
said that she hated to admit she was getting old. 'Clean, honest living,
plenty of work, plenty of good food, and a desire to help others when
sick or in trouble, I think gave me my long lease of life. I was always
so busy caring for others and thinking of them that I never had time to
worry whether I was getting old or not.'"</p>

<p id="id01638" class="calibre1">"Asa Goodwin, of Serrett, Alabama, is one hundred and six years old. His
endurance powers are even more remarkable than those of Mrs. Wagoner or
Abraham Wilcox. He walks five miles every day. He works several hours
daily in his garden, eats anything he likes, and reads without glasses.
His family is probably the largest in the United States. A reunion
recently held in his honor was attended by eight hundred and fifty
persons, three hundred and fifty being blood relatives. Goodwin has been
a hunter all his life and he frequently takes down his rifle and proves
that his aim is still good. He ascribes his length of life and vitality
to his great interest in outdoor sport and hunting, when a young man,
developing a rugged constitution that lasted him many years after he was
forced to quit strenuous work because of 'old age.' He asserts that he
was so busy living that he reached one hundred and six years before he
realized it and wants to live fifty years more if possible. 'I feel as
if I could do it, too,' he declares. 'I now can take my ease and comfort
and the world looks good to me. I have always lived a temperate life,
never drank, never kept late hours, and still have had as much or more
fun than the average man, I think. It is only now when I have nothing to
do that I get to worrying and when I find myself in that condition I
take a walk or weed the garden and then feel better.'"</p>

<p id="id01639" class="calibre1">These people are not in what some call the higher walks of life, but
they have succeeded in living, where almost all fail. They have been
useful members of society, satisfied to take life as it comes, and thus
they have gathered much of the sweet. They have enjoyed life, and those
who enjoy give enjoyment to others. It takes an audience to make even
the best of plays.</p>

<p id="id01640" class="calibre1">Mrs. Wagoner is not rich, but she has a philosophy that is riches
enough. She knows that she receives through giving. She has lived this
knowledge, which has brought blessings upon her.</p>

<p id="id01641" class="calibre1">These people have all led simple lives and they have worked. There is no
secret about growing old gracefully. It means self-control, simple
living, work for body and mind, cleanliness of body and mind, and the
most important part of physical cleanliness is a clean colon. It is
necessary to have a tranquil mind most of the time, for anger and worry
are injurious to health.</p>

<p id="id01642" class="calibre1">The average span of life is lengthening. In the sixteenth century the
average European did not live to be twenty years old. Now he lives to be
about forty. The same increase has taken place in America. In India and
China the average of life is still below twenty-four years. As
civilization advances the tendency is for the average of life to
lengthen, provided life does not grow so complex that knowledge is
antidoted by too great artificiality.</p>

<p id="id01643" class="calibre1">However, it is well to note that it is not the last part of life that is
being lengthened. We are allowing less and less infants to die as the
years roll on. The proportion of the adult population that reaches
advanced age is no greater than in the past. Our mode of life is so
wrong that tuberculosis, typhoid fever, cancer, kidney diseases,
pneumonia and circulatory degeneration carry off immense numbers of
those whom we call middle aged, but who are really young people. These
are diseases of degeneration. It is to our interest to reduce these
diseases. Proper living will do it.</p>

<p id="id01644" class="calibre1">The life expectancy of people over fifty is even less than it was thirty
years ago. Middle aged people die from diseases caused by bad habits,
extended over a period of years. Therefore, these people should learn to
live well if they would live longer.</p>

<p id="id01645" class="calibre1">The diet of the old can be about the same as that of an adult in the
prime of life, except that less should be eaten. Those who live
correctly have no digestive disturbances. It will be noted by those who
are normal that there is not a desire for as much food as earlier in
life, and this should be a guide. Old people get all the nourishment
they need in two moderate meals a day. If the three-meal-a-day plan is
preferred, it is all right, but then less should be taken at each meal.</p>

<p id="id01646" class="calibre1">White flour products are easier to digest than the whole wheat products,
but normal people can digest the latter very well and it is a better
food than white flour. I know one gentleman in his eighth decade of life
who has grown stronger and younger by abandoning the conventional eating
habits and living mostly on moderate meals of milk and whole wheat
biscuits. As Cornaro said, some need more than others, but all should be
moderate.</p>

<p id="id01647" class="calibre1">One meal a day of milk and biscuits is all right. These biscuits should
be well baked and well masticated. The milk should be taken slowly.</p>

<p id="id01648" class="calibre1">Another meal can be meat or eggs or fish with some of the cooked and raw
succulent vegetables.</p>

<p id="id01649" class="calibre1">If a third meal is taken, it may consist of clabbered milk or
buttermilk; or of one of the sweet fruits, and the sweet fruits may be
used any time in place of bread or biscuits. Cottage cheese is a good
food at any time, and may be taken with fruits, either acid or sweet.</p>

<p id="id01650" class="calibre1">As often as desired, in summer, take fruit. Because the very acid, juicy
fruits have a tendency to cause chilliness and to thin the blood, it is
well to take them in moderation during advanced years, but that does not
mean that those who like them should avoid them. In winter time the
sweet fruit is best. Mild apples and bananas may be used as often as
there is a desire for them. Oranges should be taken more rarely, as well
as grapefruit, pineapples and other fruits that are heavily charged with
acid.</p>

<p id="id01651" class="calibre1">As a general rule, the starchy foods should be eaten but once a day, but
those who are very moderate may take them twice a day without bad
results. Vegetarians have eggs and milk to take the place of flesh
foods. They also have lentils, peas, beans and the protein in the whole
wheat and other cereals. Lentils, peas and beans must be taken in
moderation, for they are rich in nutriment and if too much is eaten they
soon cause disease. Nuts, if well masticated, are also all right.</p>

<p id="id01652" class="calibre1">The general basis of feeding should be starch once a day and protein
once a day in moderation. All kinds of starch and all kinds of protein
may be used. Fruits more moderately than during the earlier years of
life is best. All the succulent vegetables that are desired may be
partaken of. By cooking the foods simply, as recommended in this book,
they are rendered easier to digest than under the conventional manner of
cooking. Simple cooking will help to preserve health and prolong life.</p>

<p id="id01653" class="calibre1">Work is one of the greatest blessings of life. Those who would live long
and be useful must exercise both body and mind. Like all other
blessings, if it is carried to excess it is injurious. It is unfortunate
that some people must work too hard because there is a class of people
who do nothing useful, being content to be wasters.</p>

<p id="id01654" class="calibre1">Work has been looked upon as a curse. This is a mistake. Those who live
in the hope and expectation that they may some day cease working in
order to enjoy life, will find when they reach the goal that life
without work is not worth while. Those who can afford it can with
benefit lessen the amount of productive work they do and evolve more
into cultural lines, but it is dangerous to cease working. The human
being is so constituted that without activity of body and mind there is
degeneration. What is sadder than to see a capable individual who has
won a competence and then has retired to enjoy it! He does not enjoy it.
Either he has to get into some line of work, physical or mental, or he
soon dies. We must have a lively interest in something or there is
stagnation.</p>

<p id="id01655" class="calibre1">There are many beautiful things in life, and we should cultivate them
while we are young enough to be able to learn to enjoy them. The
loftiest spirits of the ages have left their inspirations and their
aspirations with us in poetry, prose, music, painting, statuary and in
other forms. We should try to cultivate understanding of these subjects,
not necessarily all of them, but of one or more, for with understanding
come the elevation and broadening of mind that are always present when
there is sympathy, and sympathy is closely related to understanding.
Culture along one or more lines broadens the mind and makes a person
more worth while not only to himself, but to others. We can not estimate
the value of the beauty in life in dollars and cents, but he is poor
indeed who is rich in worldly goods alone.</p>

<p id="id01656" class="calibre1">It is necessary to be interested in the activities about us. Those who
think of nothing or no one except themselves are almost dead to the
world, even though they go through the same physical activities as other
people. The tendency is to get into a rut with advancing years and
remain there. It is easy to keep both a pliable mind and a pliable body
in spite of age, and this can be done by intelligent use. A short time
daily should be spent in becoming informed of what is happening
throughout the world and thinking it over. A mental hobby is most
excellent. A garden or a few birds can furnish an almost inexhaustible
source of interest. Those who doubt this should read of the comedy and
tragedy among such humble beings as the spider, the fly and the beetle.
J. H. Fabre has written charmingly about these, investing them with an
interest rarely to be found in good fiction. This naturalist is a good
example of what can be accomplished when one has years to do it in and
is content to labor along from day to day without giving too much
thought for the morrow. At fifty Mr. Fabre was practically unknown. Now,
at about ninety, he is one of the most admired and best loved of men.
His recognition came late and he has done much of his best work during
his later years. If Mr. Fabre had died at the average age of forty, the
world would have been deprived of his beautiful insight.</p>

<p id="id01657" class="calibre1">Another cause of old age is getting mentally old. An individual begins
to grow old by dwelling on the subject. The girl of thirteen must cease
romping and racing about because it is not lady-like. At twenty-five it
is very, very undignified to run a little. At forty a woman must be
rather sedate, for being natural would mean frivolity. People are
continually growing too old to do this and that, not because they have
lost the desire and the ability, but because it is unbecoming at their
age. This is folly. Keep a young heart all through life. A heartfelt
laugh is one of nature's best tonics. There is no more harm in dancing
at fifty than at fifteen and not so much danger.</p>

<p id="id01658" class="calibre1">The relaxation of muscles and sagging of the face are as much the result
of mental attitude as of loss of tonicity. Thinking young and
associating with children are helpful and healthful. People who are very
stiff and dignified are mentally sterile. The charming people are the
ones who are willing and able to understand and sympathize with the aims
and aspirations of others, and in order to do so it is necessary to thaw
out.</p>

<p id="id01659" class="calibre1">The art of life is delightful if properly developed.</p>

<p id="id01660" class="calibre1">Worry is such a detriment that its victims can neither live nor work as
they should. It is necessary to overcome this bad habit. Most of the
worry is due to narrow selfishness. Much of it is caused by the fact
that others will not do as we do. To try to make others accept our
standards and then worry and fret because they will not is folly. When
force is employed to convert anyone the conversion is but superficial
and lasts only so long as the converted individual's hypocrisy holds
out. To get the best out of life we have to be broad, forbearing,
patient and forgiving.</p>

<p id="id01661" class="calibre1">A normal old age is beautiful. It is the privilege, nay more, the duty
of every intelligent being to attain it. When we adjust ourselves we
shall live longer.</p>

<p id="id01662" class="calibre1">It is with old age as it is with health. We can have it if we wish it.
Accidents alone can deprive us of either. Let us hope that the day will
come when men and women will not be satisfied to die as life is but
beginning, but that they will live as they should and could live, thus
proving a blessing to the race.</p>

<div class="calibre10"></div><div class="calibre10"></div><h2 id="id01663" class="calibre11">CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<h5 id="id01664" class="calibre5">EVOLVING INTO HEALTH.</h5>

<p id="id01665" class="calibre1">By the time most people are twenty years old they have some kind of
disease. It may be only a slight catarrh, a touch of indigestion,
trouble with the eyes, defective hearing, or some other ill. Very seldom
do we meet a person of this age who is perfectly well.</p>

<p id="id01666" class="calibre1">Most people are taught to believe that health is something mysterious
which may come to them or may pass them by, but that they have little or
nothing to do with it. If they are well, they are fortunate, but if they
are ill they are not to blame.</p>

<p id="id01667" class="calibre1">Most of them go to conventional physicians when they are ill, expecting
to be cured. They take medicine or injections of serums or they are
operated upon. When they are through with the doctors they are no wiser
than they were before.</p>

<p id="id01668" class="calibre1">A few have friends who tell them that they must change their mode of
living if they would have health. They are interested enough to go to a
healer who believes in nature. He tells them that they are well or ill
according to their desserts, that they can be well at all times, if they
wish, for if they live as they should health is a natural consequence.</p>

<p id="id01669" class="calibre1">This sounds like nonsense at first. It is different from anything else
they have heard. The sufferer often makes up his mind that the healer is
a fool or a faker. He remembers that when he went to the conventional
physicians they sounded and thumped him and examined all his excretions.
They were very thorough and scientific. The natural healer does not
generally go into so many details. He asks enough and examines enough to
find the trouble and then he stops. This the patient charges against
him, for he takes for granted that the healer is brief from lack of
knowledge.</p>

<p id="id01670" class="calibre1">So he goes back to his old physician. As his trouble is due to deranged
nutrition, he does not get well. He thinks over what the natural healer
said, and the more he thinks about it the more reasonable it sounds, and
he returns again. This time he gets instructions, and he follows them
enough to get benefit, but not faithfully enough to get well. He is
convinced that the conventional physicians are wrong, but still believes
that the natural healer can hardly be right.</p>

<p id="id01671" class="calibre1">After a while he makes up his mind to get down to business and he goes
to the healer for instructions and follows them. The results are
surprising. The trouble he has had for years may disappear within a
month or two, or it may become less and less apparent, but take
considerable time before it leaves entirely.</p>

<p id="id01672" class="calibre1">The healer gives instructions. The most important ones are those
concerning the diet. A plan is given that brings good results. The
healer fails to explain that this is but one correct method of feeding,
that there are other good ones. The patient is enthused over the
benefits derived, he makes up his mind that he is living the only
correct life, and he too often becomes a food crank, trying to force his
ideas upon all about him. Here the healer is at fault, for he should
explain that some method is necessary, but that there is no one and only
method of feeding.</p>

<p id="id01673" class="calibre1">If the patient is fairly intelligent, in time he realizes that it is not
so much what he eats as his manner of eating and moderation that are
helpful, and that any plan in which moderation and simplicity are
followed is better than the ordinary way of eating.</p>

<p id="id01674" class="calibre1">As the patient evolves into health and gets a broader view of the art of
living, he gets a better perspective of life. He learns that under like
conditions like causes always produce like effects, that the law of
compensation is always operative, and we therefore get what we deserve.
He loses his fear of many things that caused him grave concern
previously. He sees in sickness and death the working of natural law,
not of chance.</p>

<p id="id01675" class="calibre1">Some patients realize that healers who work in accordance with nature
are right, at the very start, but most people are not so logically
constructed. It often takes from one to three years before people make
up their mind to order their lives so that they can have health at their
command.</p>

<p id="id01676" class="calibre1">In the old way, the doctor was supposed to cure, which was impossible.
In the new way, the healer educates people and then if they live their
knowledge they get health.</p>

<p id="id01677" class="calibre1">The healer must instruct in the care of all parts of the body, weeding
out bad habits and trying to instill good ones in their place.</p>

<p id="id01678" class="calibre1">Eating according to correct principles is the most helpful and powerful
aid in regaining health. The patient finds that as the years pass his
tastes change, becoming more simple and more moderate. He is well
nourished on one-half to one-third of what he used to consume and
consider necessary.</p>

<p id="id01679" class="calibre1">The following is the last half of a month's record of food intake for a
man in the thirties. Some years ago he changed his manner of living in
order to regain health, in which he succeeded. Now he takes only one or
two meals a day, according to his desires, not that he has any objection
to three meals a day, but he finds it best to eat more seldom. He is in
good physical condition, as heavy as he ought to be, and he has not had
any real physical trouble for a number of years. His work is mental, but
he walks considerably and swims from three to six times a week, besides
taking a few set exercises.</p>

<p id="id01680" class="calibre1">It was taken in spring, the weather averaging cool. This is a little
lighter than usual, because the record was taken during a period of
exceptionally hard mental work. In cold weather heavier foods are taken.</p>

<p id="id01681" class="calibre1">Lunch: Nothing.</p>

<p id="id01682" class="calibre1">Dinner: Three slices of rye toast, very thin, celery, three slices
broiled onion, dish of peas, glass of beer.</p>

<p id="id01683" class="calibre2">Dinner at noon: Roast lamb, dish of spinach, one and one-half dishes
summer squash, lettuce and tomato salad.</p>

<p id="id01684" class="calibre1">Supper: Nothing.</p>

<p id="id01685" class="calibre2">Lunch: Dish of baked lentils, vegetable soup, lettuce.</p>

<p id="id01686" class="calibre1">Dinner: Two small oranges, cottage cheese.</p>

<p id="id01687" class="calibre2">Lunch: Piece of gingerbread, cup of cocoa, two lumps of sugar.</p>

<p id="id01688" class="calibre1">Dinner: Two small oranges, cottage cheese.</p>

<p id="id01689" class="calibre2">Lunch: Dish of stewed prunes, tablespoonful cottage cheese.</p>

<p id="id01690" class="calibre1">Dinner: Two eggs, two slices buttered toast.</p>

<p id="id01691" class="calibre2">Lunch: Small grapefruit.</p>

<p id="id01692" class="calibre1">Dinner: Vegetable soup, dish of stewed turnips, dish of peas.</p>

<p id="id01693" class="calibre2">Lunch: Nothing.</p>

<p id="id01694" class="calibre1">Dinner: Half a grapefruit, three stewed figs, glass of milk.</p>

<p id="id01695" class="calibre2">Lunch: Dish of strawberries, large dish of rhubarb with grapefruit juice
in it and cream on the side; half serving cream cheese.</p>

<p id="id01696" class="calibre1">Dinner: Two small baked apples.</p>

<p id="id01697" class="calibre2">Lunch: Small grapefruit.</p>

<p id="id01698" class="calibre1">Dinner: Two eggs, dish of turnips, dish of spinach, sliced tomatoes.</p>

<p id="id01699" class="calibre2">Lunch: One raw apple.</p>

<p id="id01700" class="calibre1">Dinner: Two shredded wheat biscuits, glass of milk.</p>

<p id="id01701" class="calibre2">Lunch: Dish of rhubarb.</p>

<p id="id01702" class="calibre1">Dinner: Vegetable soup, one egg, a boiled potato.</p>

<p id="id01703" class="calibre2">Lunch: Dish of rhubarb.</p>

<p id="id01704" class="calibre1">Dinner: Sweet potato, dish of parsnips, stewed peas.</p>

<p id="id01705" class="calibre2">Lunch: Dish of ice cream, piece of white cake. Dinner: Cheese cake, dish
of fruit salad.</p>

<p id="id01706" class="calibre2">Lunch: One hard boiled egg, about one and one-half slices white bread,
two big radishes, one young onion, butter.</p>

<p id="id01707" class="calibre1">Dinner: Nothing.</p>

<p id="id01708" class="calibre2">The servings are the ordinary restaurant servings. No dressings were
used except the ones mentioned. This man used to be very fond of sweets
and employed salt freely. Now he finds his foods more agreeable when
taken plain, for they have a better flavor. He rarely uses salt or
pepper. He has simplified his food intake because he finds he feels
better and stronger and is able to think to better advantage than he did
when he partook of a greater variety and amount of food at each meal.</p>

<p id="id01709" class="calibre1">Food scientists say that from two thousand, seven hundred to three
thousand, three hundred calories are needed daily, but you will note
that this man generally keeps below one-half of this, if you are able to
figure food values.</p>

<p id="id01710" class="calibre1">People who are trying to get well are often called fools and cranks when
they treat themselves properly, but this does not matter, for such fools
generally live to see their wise critics prematurely consigned to the
earth.</p>

<p id="id01711" class="calibre1">When taking health advice, try to keep your balance. Get thoroughly well
before you try to guide others.</p>

<h5 id="id01713" class="calibre5">RETROSPECT.</h5>

<p id="id01714" class="calibre1">Several hundred pages have been devoted to those matters which must
receive attention in order to have good physical and mental health, so
as to be able to get the most out of life and give the most, that is, in
order to live fully. The basis of health is internal cleanliness, and to
attain this it is necessary to exercise self-control and moderation, as
well as to cultivate good will and kindliness towards others. Kindness
and love lubricate life and make the running smooth. Envy, spite, hatred
and the other negative emotions act like sand in the bearings, producing
friction in the vital machinery, which they destroy in the end.</p>

<p id="id01715" class="calibre1">Success in life means balance, poise, adjustment. We must adjust
ourselves so as to be in harmony with others, and we must be in harmony
with nature. Our minds will at times be in opposition to the laws of
nature. Then we must exercise enough self-control to bring them into
harmony again, for natural laws are no respecters of persons. It is said
that we break these laws, but that is not true. If we disregard them
often enough they break us. We must realize our unity with nature, our
at-one-ment. We must realize that we are a part of nature, not above it,
and hence that we are governed by the same fixed laws that govern the
rest of nature. These laws are for our good. Attempts to escape from
their workings indicate a lack of understanding.</p>

<p id="id01716" class="calibre1">Discord produces disease and death. Harmony leads to health and long
life.</p>

<p id="id01717" class="calibre1">The adjustment must be both physical and mental.</p>

<p id="id01718" class="calibre1">The physical part means to live or adjust ourselves so that all the
functions of the body are carried on normally. The body is
self-regulating and if we do nothing harmful health will be our portion.
However, life under our present civilization is so complex that the
demands upon our nervous systems are excessive. It is easy to live so
that we can have health, but to do so is not conventional, and hence not
very popular.</p>

<p id="id01719" class="calibre1">In order to have good physical health under present conditions, it is
necessary to make some effort. The effort is not great enough to be
onerous and does not require much time. It is important to get health
knowledge, which the majority lacks today. This knowledge is most
excellent, but it does not benefit the individual unless it is applied.
We all wish to have health, but this is not enough. We must will to have
it. When we say that we cannot, it should generally be interpreted to
mean that we will not.</p>

<p id="id01720" class="calibre1">Some important subjects regarding which special knowledge should be
secured are: Food, drink, exercise, care of the skin, sleep, work and
play, breathing, clothing, and mental attitude.</p>

<p id="id01721" class="calibre1">These subjects, as well as others, have been quite extensively
discussed. It is impossible to give full information in tabloid form. It
is also impossible to read a book of this character once and get all the
information it contains. Those who are in earnest will study the
subject, instead of merely reading it.</p>

<p id="id01722" class="calibre1">Allow me to remind you that nearly all of our diseases are due to faulty
dietary habits. So it was in the time of Hippocrates, according to that
sage, and so it is today. It is a common statement that about 90 per
cent. of our physical ills come from improper diet, and this is the
truth. It follows from this that it is most important to know about
correct feeding habits, and put them in practice. Improper diet results
in faulty nutrition, after which physical and mental ills make their
appearance.</p>

<p id="id01723" class="calibre1">There are many systems of feeding, and nearly all of them will bring
good results if the most important prescription is followed, namely,
moderation. Simplicity leads to moderation.</p>

<p id="id01724" class="calibre1">Those who are reasonable about their food intake often serve as targets
for the shafts of ridicule launched at them by those who are ignorant of
the subject or too self-indulgent to exercise a little self-control.
Ridicule is one of the most deadly of weapons, but it never harms those
who have the hardihood of getting down to basic facts and classifying
things and ideas according to their true value. Why should we be guided
by the wit and sarcasm of indolent voluptuaries who daily desecrate
their bodies through ruinous indulgences?</p>

<p id="id01725" class="calibre1">There is no need of becoming harsh and austere, nor is it necessary to
fall into deadly habits of self-indulgence. Sometimes we can go with the
current with benefit, but at times it is also necessary to paddle
up-stream. Life demands a certain amount of hardihood from those who
would live in health, and this comes not from self-indulgence, but from
self-denial. It is necessary to do almost daily something that we are
not inclined to do.</p>

<p id="id01726" class="calibre1">It is well to remember that if the eating is correct, it is difficult to
become physically deranged, and consequently to become mentally
deranged. Allow me to repeat four short sentences which are helpful and
most important guides, sentences which ought to form a part of every
child's education:</p>

<p id="id01727" class="calibre1">If ill, eat nothing, but live on water.</p>

<p id="id01728" class="calibre1">Eat only when there is a desire for food.</p>

<p id="id01729" class="calibre1">Masticate all foods thoroughly.</p>

<p id="id01730" class="calibre1">Always be moderate in your food intake.</p>

<p id="id01731" class="calibre1">These are the four golden rules regarding eating, and if they were
adhered to, they would save us from an incalculable amount of sin and
suffering. They would increase the duration of life and the joy of
living. They would add to our physical and mental prosperity. Hence they
are worthy of the emphasis given them.</p>

<p id="id01732" class="calibre1">In brief: Physical health is based on internal cleanliness, which can be
attained only through moderation, that is, by not habitually
overburdening the system, especially with food. Our bodies thrive when
used, but not when abused. It is necessary for our physical well-being
to get air, sunshine, water, food, sleep, rest, exercise, work and play
in proper proportion, and in addition cultivate a kindly, balanced
spirit. Drugs, such as alcohol, coffee, morphine, bromine, and hundreds
of others which could be named, are not only unnecessary, but harmful.</p>

<p id="id01733" class="calibre1">The mental side is as important as the physical side. With a healthy
body it is easy to have a happy outlook. Indigestion and biliousness can
make a dreary waste out of the most beautiful landscape. The body and
mind react and interact, one upon the other. When one is poised it is
easy to get the other into balance. It requires a poised body to produce
the best fruitage—a fine spirit.</p>

<p id="id01734" class="calibre1">It is necessary to be honest with one's self. Face life courageously and
honestly. If you do, you will soon realize that the physical and mental
ills from which you suffer are mostly of your own making. Then you can
choose whether to let them continue or to end them, but if you choose to
remain ill, bear your cross uncomplainingly, for you have no right to
afflict others with your self-imposed sufferings.</p>

<p id="id01735" class="calibre1">On the other hand, try to see life from the view point of others, and
you will often find that what you think is the highest good and most
desirable in life does not seem worthy of great effort to them. Variety
adds spice to life. To impose one's own views and ways on others has
always seemed desirable to the majority of people, but it is the height
of folly and stupidity. So long as the race exists there will be many
men of many minds, and it is best so. We can not force any benefit, such
as health or goodness, upon others. Instead of attracting, the process
of forcing repels.</p>

<p id="id01736" class="calibre1">What we can do mentally to benefit ourselves and others is to get
adjusted, to cultivate kindness and charity, to be broad-minded and
forgiving, to be slow to take and give offense, to accept the little
buffetings that fate has in store for us all with good grace, and
through it all to possess our souls in patience.</p>

<p id="id01737" class="calibre1">Physically, be moderate.</p>

<p id="id01738" class="calibre1">Mentally, cultivate equanimity.</p>

<p id="id01774" class="calibre1">1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.</p>

<h5 id="id01775" class="calibre5">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h5>

<p id="id01776" class="calibre1">Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p id="id01777" class="calibre1">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org</p>

<h3 id="id01778" class="calibre9">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p id="id01779" class="calibre1">The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p id="id01780" class="calibre1">The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

<h5 id="id01783" class="calibre5">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h5>

<p id="id01784" class="calibre1">Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p id="id01785" class="calibre1">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<p id="id01786" class="calibre1">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p id="id01787" class="calibre1">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p id="id01788" class="calibre1">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h5 id="id01789" class="calibre5">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h5>

<p id="id01790" class="calibre1">Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p id="id01791" class="calibre1">Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p id="id01792" class="calibre1">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p id="id01793" class="calibre1">This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
