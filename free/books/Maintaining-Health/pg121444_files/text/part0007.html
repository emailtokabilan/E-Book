    Dr. Linda Burfield Hazzard, in the latest edition of her book, Fasting
for the Cure of Disease, states that she has treated almost two thousand
five hundred people by this method, the fasts varying in duration from
eight to seventy five days, many of them being over a month. Sixteen of
her patients have died while fasting and two on a light diet. This is
far from being a mortality of 1 per cent. When the fact is taken into
consideration that the people she treated were of the class for whom the
average medical man can do nothing the mortality is surprisingly small.
However, she has lost a few, and as she is a fighter for her beliefs the
prejudice against her and her method of treating disease have proved
strong enough to cause her to be imprisoned. Dr. Hazzard has perhaps the
widest experience with fasting of any mortal, living or dead. Her book
is well worth reading.</p>

<p id="id01304" class="calibre1">Upton Sinclair has also written a book on this subject, entitled the
Fasting Cure. He writes from the viewpoint of an intelligent layman
whose observations are not very extensive. The book contains many good
ideas. This is from page fifty-seven:</p>

<p id="id01305" class="calibre1">"The longest fast of which I had heard when my article was written was
seventy eight days; but that record has since been broken, by a man
named Richard Fausel. Mr. Fausel, who keeps a hotel somewhere in North
Dakota, had presumably partaken too generously of the good cheer
intended for his guests, for he found himself at the inconvenient weight
of three hundred and eighty-five pounds. He went to a sanatorium in
Battle Creek and there fasted for forty days (if my recollection serves
me), and by dint of vigorous exercise meanwhile, he got rid of one
hundred and thirty pounds. I think I never saw a funnier sight than Mr.
Fausel at the conclusion of this fast, wearing the same pair of trousers
that he had worn at the beginning of it. But the temptations of
hotel-keepers are severe, and when he went back home, he found himself
going up in weight again. This time he concluded to do the job
thoroughly, and went to Macfadden's place in Chicago, and set out upon a
fast of ninety days. That is a new record—though I sometimes wonder if
it is quite fair to call it 'fasting' when a man is simply living upon
an internal larder of fat."</p>

<p id="id01306" class="calibre1">Bernarr Macfadden has also written considerable about fasting. C. C.
Haskell is an advocate and director of such treatment. Many physicians
employ this healing method. Some day the entire medical profession will
realize the worth of fasting as a curative agent.</p>

<p id="id01307" class="calibre1">As a reminder, please allow me to repeat: When reading and studying
about the subject of fasting, do not think of it as a complete cure, for
those who return to their improper mode of living will again build
disease. After the fast, live right.</p>

<p id="id01308" class="calibre1">The efficient body is clean internally. An unclean skin is bad. A foul
alimentary tract is worse. But the worst of all is a foul condition of
all the tissues, including the blood-stream, a condition in which much
of the body's waste is stored up, instead of being excreted.</p>

<p id="id01309" class="calibre1">If such a condition can not be remedied through moderation and
simplicity in eating, the only thing that will prove of value is
temporary abstinence.</p>

<p id="id01310" class="calibre1">It would be an easy matter to enumerate many long fasts, such as that of
Dr. Tanner, who proved to an astonished country that fasting for a month
or more is not fatal, but on the contrary may be beneficial. Or we could
cite cases like the fasts carried on by classes under the direction of
Bernarr Macfadden. Or we could refer to the experiments of Professors
Fisher and Chittenden of Yale.</p>

<p id="id01311" class="calibre1">However, we will only look into one more case, that of Dr. I. J. Eales,
whose fast created considerable interest several years ago. The doctor
was too heavy, so he decided to take a fast to reduce his weight, also
for scientific purposes. For thirty days he lived on nothing but water
with an occasional glass of lemonade and one cup of coffee. At the end
of thirty days he broke his fast on a glass of malted milk.</p>

<p id="id01312" class="calibre1">The doctor worked hard during all this period, losing weight all the
time, being thirty pounds lighter at the end of his fast than at the
beginning. However, he did not lose strength, being able to do as much
work and lift as heavy weights at the end of the fast as at the
beginning. Anyone who is much over weight can with benefit do as the
doctor did, for the body will use the stored up fat to produce heat and
energy. This fast is fully detailed in Dr. Eales' book called
Healthology.</p>

<p id="id01313" class="calibre1">Fasting is the quickest way to produce internal cleanliness, which is
health. When the system is clean the cravings, longings and appetites
are not so strong as when the body is full of poisons. For this reason a
fast is the best way to destroy the cravings for tobacco, coffee, tea,
alcohol and other habit-forming drugs. If, after the fast is over, the
individual lives moderately and simply, and is fully determined not to
return to the use of these drugs, a permanent cure will be the reward.
However, it is very easy to drift back into the old habits. A permanent
cure requires that there be no compromise, no saying, "I shall do it
this time, but never again." Once the old habit is resumed, it is almost
certain to be continued.</p>

<h5 id="id01315" class="calibre5">ATTITUDE OF PARENT TOWARD CHILD.</h5>

<p id="id01316" class="calibre1">Healthy, happy children are the greatest of all rewards. All parents can
have such children, and it is a duty they owe themselves, the children
and the race. It is a most pleasant duty, for the returns are far
greater than the cost.</p>

<p id="id01317" class="calibre1">In order to have first-class children parents must be in good physical
condition and be controlled mentally. Chaotic parents can not have
orderly children. The young people learn quickly from their elders and
they usually take after one of the parents. They intuitively learn what
they can do and what they can not do and how to get their way while we
consider them too young to have any understanding.</p>

<p id="id01318" class="calibre1">Therefore it is important that their first impressions are correct.
Begin to train the child in the way it should go from the day of birth.
The first training will have to do with feeding and sleeping. These
points are covered more fully in the next chapter. They are touched upon
here to give them emphasis.</p>

<p id="id01319" class="calibre1">Feed the child three times a day, but never wake it to be fed. If you
give the three feeds, the child will soon become accustomed to them and
wake when it is time. If the child squirms and frets, it may be
uncomfortable from being overfed or it may be thirsty. Offer it water
but not food.</p>

<p id="id01320" class="calibre1">Let the child alone. Do not bounce it or carry it about. During the
first few months the baby needs heat, nourishment and rest, and should
have no excitement. It should not be treated as a plaything. After a few
months it begins to take notice of things and then you can have much fun
with it.</p>

<p id="id01321" class="calibre1">The right kind of love consists in doing what is necessary for the
infant and no more.</p>

<p id="id01322" class="calibre1">Obedience to the reasonable requests of the parents is of the greatest
importance in the successful raising of children. Parents should realize
this even before the children are born. From the first, be firm, though
gentle, with the little ones. Children should be so trained that when
they are requested to do a thing, they do it immediately without any
repetition. This will save both them and the parents many an unhappy
hour.</p>

<p id="id01323" class="calibre1">The lives of many parents and many children are made miserable from lack
of a little parental firmness at the start.</p>

<p id="id01324" class="calibre1">There are many little graces that are not vital, yet they are important,
and these should be taught children early, for then they become second
nature. Among these are good table manners. Ungainly table manners have
no bearing on the health, but they give an unfavorable impression to
others. We are partly judged by the presence or absence of such little
graces.</p>

<p id="id01325" class="calibre1">Training children is like training trees. A sapling can be made to grow
in the desired way, but after a few years it will not respond to
training. The period of infancy is plastic, and then is the time to
plant the seeds in the child's mind and teach good habits.</p>

<p id="id01326" class="calibre1">It is not difficult to train the children. If the parents are orderly
and firm, instead of wavering, the children almost intuitively fall into
line. Teach them to obey and they will later be able to command
intelligently and considerately.</p>

<p id="id01327" class="calibre1">The babies are helpless at first. This softens the hearts of the parents
toward them until they become very indulgent. Indulging and pampering
children are bad for them. Kindness consists in doing for them what is
for their good, which is not always what they desire.</p>

<p id="id01328" class="calibre1">If the children are properly trained at first, they need very little
training later on.</p>

<div class="calibre10"></div><div class="calibre10"></div><h2 id="id01329" class="calibre11">CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<h5 id="id01330" class="calibre5">CHILDREN.</h5>

<p id="id01331" class="calibre1">Statistics are generally very dry and uninteresting, but at times they
take on a tragic interest, and the importance of the few submitted here
is so great that they should command careful attention.</p>

<p id="id01332" class="calibre1">The definite figures used are taken from the Mortality Statistics,
United States Census, and they cover the year 1912, which is the last
year for which we have definite information. Reliable mortality
statistics are given only in a part of the country, which is not to our
credit. The population is reported in the volume as 92,309,348. The
registration area, which is the area giving mortality statistics,
contains 53,843,896 people. In this area the total deaths are as
follows:</p>

<p id="id01333" class="calibre1">  Under one year………….. 154,373<br class="calibre12"/>

  Under ten years…………. 235,262<br class="calibre12"/>
</p>

<p id="id01334" class="calibre1">Taking it for granted that the infant and child mortality among the
unregistered people is the same, we get the following number of deaths
annually among children in the United States, in round numbers:</p>

<p id="id01335" class="calibre1">  Under one year………….. 280,000<br class="calibre12"/>

  Under ten years…………. 425,000<br class="calibre12"/>
</p>

<p id="id01336" class="calibre1">This is a very conservative estimate and 300,000 is usually given as the
number of deaths annually among babies under the age of one year.</p>

<p id="id01337" class="calibre1">Even under ideal conditions a baby would occasionally die, but the
deaths would be so rare that they would be the cause of surprised
comment. Some become parents who have no right to be, and they bring
children into the world who are not physically fit to survive, and these
generally die within a few days or weeks of birth. However, these babies
are but a small minority and at least ninety-nine out of a hundred
should survive. Not one baby born physically fit would die if
intelligently cared for, and the fact that each year we lose over
one-fourth million infants under one year of age in the United States is
an indictment of our lives and intelligence, and a challenge to better
our ways.</p>

<p id="id01338" class="calibre1">Every child that is brought into the world should be given an
opportunity to live. This is far from the case today. Children are so
handicapped that they are stunted in body and blunted in mind, if they
survive.</p>

<p id="id01339" class="calibre1">Suppose that every ten years an army of 4,250,000 men and women between
the ages of twenty and thirty were destroyed at one time in this
country! The indignation, sorrow and horror would be so great that a
means would soon be found to end the periodic slaughter.</p>

<p id="id01340" class="calibre1">But we allow this many children under ten to be destroyed every ten
years. The slaughter of the innocents does not bring forth much protest,
because we are so used to it, and the babies go one by one, all over the
country. The procession to the grave gives rise to this thought: "The
little one is better off. Now he will suffer no more. It is the will of
Providence." This is a libel on Providence, for this enormous mortality
is due to parental mistakes, mistakes made mostly through ignorance, but
blamable all the same. It behooves parents to obtain knowledge that will
prevent such costly and fatal errors. Nature's law is the same as man's
rule in this that ignorance of the law excuses no one. The results are
the same whether we err knowingly or ignorantly.</p>

<p id="id01341" class="calibre1">It is difficult to teach people to treat their babies properly, because
nearly all the information on the subject is so erroneous. When a
teacher brings forth the truth but few accept it, for the vast majority
are on the other side. Those parents who accept the truth find it
difficult, to put it into practice, for every hand is against them. It
takes more strength of character and moral courage than the average
individual possesses to withstand the criticism of neighbors, friends,
relatives and medical advisers.</p>

<p id="id01342" class="calibre1">The few who have the courage of their convictions and the right
knowledge reap a rich harvest. They have babies who are well. They see
their children grow up with sound bodies and clear minds. They are saved
much of the worry which is the lot of parents of children raised
according to conventional standards. Last, but by no means least, they
have the satisfaction of giving to the race individuals who are better
than their parents or the grandparents. There is much opportunity for
human improvement, and the improvement will take place automatically, if
we do not prevent it by going contrary to nature.</p>

<p id="id01343" class="calibre1">Healthy babies spring from normal, healthy parents. If they can have
normal grandparents, so much the better, but inasmuch as we can not
alter the past, let us give our attention to the present. If we take
care of the present, the future will bring forth a population of healthy
parents and grandparents, and then the babies will have full
opportunity. The past has great influence, for the child of today is
heir of the past, modified by the present. He who influences the present
leaves his mark on the future. As individuals we do not usually
accomplish much during a lifetime, but if we influence our time for the
better it is hard to tell where the improvement will cease or what will
be the aggregate result. A truth imparted to others acts much like a
pebble cast into the water. Its influence is felt in ever widening
circles.</p>

<p id="id01344" class="calibre1">Infancy and youth are plastic. Both body and mind are susceptible to
surrounding influences. If the heredity is unfavorable it can be largely
modified by favorable environments. If a child is born of unhealthy
parents, but without any serious defect, and is intelligently cared for
after birth, it will grow up to be healthy. On the other hand, a child
born of healthy parents that is improperly cared for will become ill and
perhaps die young.</p>

<p id="id01345" class="calibre1">In early years the habits are formed that will largely influence and
control the years of maturity. Most children learn bad habits from
birth. It is as easy to acquire good habits as bad ones, and as people
are largely creatures of habits, every parent should aim to give his
children a good start. Parents seldom do wrong intentionally, but they
are careless and many of the parental habits of the race are bad, and
for this the future generations must suffer.</p>

<p id="id01346" class="calibre1">It is easier and more economical to have healthy babies than to have
sickly ones. The healthy way is the simple way. It merely means
self-control, common sense and constructive knowledge on the part of the
parents.</p>

<h4 id="id01347" class="calibre14">PRENATAL CARE.</h4>

<p id="id01348" class="calibre1">It is commonly believed that a pregnant woman must eat for two. The wise
woman will not increase her food intake. If she is not up to par
physically at the time of conception she will generally find it
advantageous to decrease the food allowance.</p>

<p id="id01349" class="calibre1">A healthy baby should not weigh to exceed six, or at most seven, pounds
at birth. Five pounds would be better. It does not take much food to
nourish an infant of that weight, and the baby does not weigh that much
until shortly before birth. Most of the food is used for fuel but the
amount of fuel required to heat a baby that is kept warm within the
mother's body is almost negligible.</p>

<p id="id01350" class="calibre1">One of the first and most important requisites for having healthy
children is to avoid the eating-for-two fallacy. Most people overeat,
anyway, and there should be no encouragement in this line.</p>

<p id="id01351" class="calibre1">The results of overeating are many and serious. The mother grows too
heavy or else she becomes dyspeptic. Overeating and partaking of food of
poor quality are the chief causes of the ills of pregnancy. Prospective
mothers can be comfortable. Pregnancy and childbirth are physiological.
Normal women suffer very little inconvenience or pain. The suffering
during pregnancy, the pain and accidents at childbirth are measures of
the mother's abnormality. The greater the inconvenience the farther has
the individual strayed from a natural life. The women who live normally
from the time of conception, or before, until the birth of the baby will
be surprised how little inconvenience there is.</p>

<p id="id01352" class="calibre1">For ideal results the father must be kind, considerate and
self-controlled. It is a disagreeable fact that many men are brutal and
inconsiderate of wives and unborn children. The extent of this brutality
can hardly be realized by those who have had no medical experience.
Perhaps the women are partly to blame, for they do not teach their boys
to be considerate and kind and they leave them in ignorance of subjects
that are important and that can best be taught by parents.</p>

<p id="id01353" class="calibre1">A pregnant woman should be mistress of her body. During this period the
husband has morally no marital rights. If boys were educated by their
parents on this subject they would be reasonable later on, and the
average boy of fourteen or fifteen is old enough to receive such
education.</p>

<p id="id01354" class="calibre1">Gestation should be a period of calm. All excitement and passion are
harmful. The mother should be as free from annoyance as possible.
Cheerfulness should be the rule. Those who are not naturally cheerful
should cultivate this desirable state of mind. Gruesome and horrible
topics should not be discussed. The reading should not be along tragic
lines. The study of nature and the philosophy of men who have found life
sweet are among the helpful mental occupations. The mental attitude has
its effect, not only on the mother, but on the unborn babe. That the
seed for good or evil is often planted in the child's brain before
birth, according to the mental and physical condition of the mother, can
hardly be doubted. Mothers who live naturally can dismiss all worry on
the subject of harm coming to themselves through maternity, for there
will be none. The absence of worry has a good effect on both mother and
child.</p>

<p id="id01355" class="calibre1">The various ills from which mothers suffer are largely caused by eating
for two. The overeating causes overweight in those whose nutrition is
above par and indigestion in those who have but ordinary digestive
capacity. Those who are overweight have too high blood pressure and
those who have indigestion absorb some of the poisonous products of
decomposition from the bowels. Headache is a common result. Palpitation
of the heart comes from gas pressure. The abnormal blood pressure may
result in albuminurea, swelling of the lower extremities and overweight
of both mother and child. The morning sickness is nearly always due to
excessive food intake. If this proves troublesome, reduce the amount of
food and simplify the combinations. Instead of taking heavy, rich
dishes, increase the amount of fresh fruits and vegetables.</p>

<p id="id01356" class="calibre1">The birth of a large baby is fraught with danger to mother and child.
Sometimes one or both are injured and sometimes one or both die. Many
women are afraid to become mothers for this reason. It would be
difficult to estimate how often this fear causes law breaking, for all
large cities have their medical men who grow rich through illegal
practices among these women. Sometimes these doctors are among the
respected members of the profession, eminent enough to have a national
reputation. The financial reward is great enough to tempt men to break
the law and they will continue to do so, so long as present conditions
exist.</p>

<p id="id01357" class="calibre1">It is important for the prospective mother to be moderate in her eating.
Three meals a day are sufficient. Between meals nothing but water should
be swallowed. Lunching always leads to overeating.</p>

<p id="id01358" class="calibre1">One meal each day can consist of starchy food, but not more than one
meal. Any one of the starches may be selected, the cereal products,
rice, potatoes, chestnuts. If the digestion is good, take matured beans,
peas or lentils occasionally, but these are so heavy that they should
not be eaten very frequently and always in moderation. With the starchy
food selected, take either butter or milk, or a moderate quantity of
both. Sometimes it is all right to take some fruit with the starchy
food, but this should be the exception, not the rule. Fruit should
generally be eaten by itself or taken with non-starchy foods. Starch
eating should be limited to one meal a day because an excessive amount
of this food causes hardening of the tissues. The baby's bones, which
should be very soft, flexible and yielding at birth, will become too
hard if much starch is eaten.</p>

<p id="id01359" class="calibre1">Once a day some kind of proteid food may be taken, but this should also
be eaten in moderation, for if it is not, degenerative changes will take
place, which will manifest in some one of the disorders common to
pregnancy. Eggs and the lighter kinds of meats, or nuts or fresh fish
may be selected. Whatever kind of protein is taken, it should be as
fresh as possible. Pork should not be used. With the protein, have
either fruit or vegetables, and it does not make much difference which.
No one could ask for a better meal than good apples and pecans.</p>

<p id="id01360" class="calibre1">Be sure to eat enough of the raw salad vegetables and of raw fruits to
supply the salts needed by the body.</p>

<p id="id01361" class="calibre1">For the third meal have fruit. Cottage cheese, sweet or clabbered milk
or buttermilk may be taken with the fruit. Do not take milk twice a day,
for if it is taken twice and other proteid food once a day, too much
protein is ingested.</p>

<p id="id01362" class="calibre1">A glass or two of buttermilk will make a good meal at any time. Dr.
Waugh, who has had over forty years of experience and is well and
favorably known on both sides of the Atlantic, recommends buttermilk
very highly during pregnancy.  Buttermilk and clabbered milk are better
than the sweet milk.  The lactic acid seems to have a sweetening effect
on the alimentary tract. Sweet milk is constipating for many people. The
buttermilk and the clabbered milk are not constipating to the same
degree.</p>

<p id="id01363" class="calibre1">The use of fruit and vegetables has a tendency to prevent constipation.
The only internal remedies for which there is any excuse are cathartics,
and normal people do not need them. However, it is better to take a mild
cathartic or an enema than to allow the colon to become loaded with
waste. Constipation among eaters of much meat is rather a serious
condition, for the waste in the colon of heavy meat eaters is very
poisonous. The colonic waste in vegetarians is not so toxic.</p>

<p id="id01364" class="calibre1">Desserts should be used sparingly and seldom.  They are not a necessity,
but a habit, and if they are consumed daily they are a bad habit.</p>

<p id="id01365" class="calibre1">For the sake of the unborn child, avoid all stimulants and narcotics.
Alcoholics and coffee should not be used. And it is best to avoid strong
spices and rich gravies. A little self-denial and self-control in this
line will pay great dividends in healthy, happy, contented babies, and
there are no greater blessings.</p>

<p id="id01366" class="calibre1">The mother should be active, but should not take any violent exercise.
Light work is good, but no mother should Be asked to do house-cleaning
or to stand over the wash-tub. She should have the opportunity of being
in the open every day, and of this opportunity she should avail herself.
Why some women are ashamed of pregnancy is hard for normal-minded people
to understand, for the praise of motherhood has been sung by the
greatest poets and its glory depicted by the greatest painters of the
world.</p>

<p id="id01367" class="calibre1">This sense of false modesty is responsible for much of the tight lacing
during pregnancy. This is injurious to both the mother and the child,
and is one of the reasons for various uncomfortable sensations. It helps
to bring on the morning sickness. It is nature's intention that the
young should be free and comfortable previous to birth, and for this
reason a double bag is supplied between the walls of which there is
fluid. The baby lies within the inner bag.</p>

<p id="id01368" class="calibre1">The tight lacing prevents the intended freedom, besides weakening the
mother's muscles. It also aggravates any tendency there may be toward
constipation and swelling of the legs. It prolongs childbirth and makes
it more painful. This is too high a price to pay for false modesty and
vanity.</p>

<p id="id01369" class="calibre1">If it is necessary to support the abdomen and the breasts for the sake
of comfort, this can be done without compressing them and the support
should come from the shoulders.</p>

<p id="id01370" class="calibre1">The skin should be given good attention, for an active skin helps to
keep the blood pure and the circulation normal. Take a vigorous dry
rubbing at least once a day, and twice a day would be better.  A quick
sponging off with cool water followed with vigorous dry rubbing is good,
but the rubbing is of greater importance than the sponging. An olive oil
rub is often soothing and may be taken as frequently as desired.</p>

<p id="id01371" class="calibre1">If there is a tendency to be ill and nervous, take a good hot bath,
staying in the water until there is a feeling of ease, even if it should
take more than thirty minutes, provided the heart and the kidneys are
working well. Defective heart and kidney action contraindicate prolonged
hot baths, but such ills will not appear if the mother lives properly.
Under such conditions missing a few meals can only have good results.
When eating is resumed, partake of only enough food to nourish the body,
for anything beyond that builds discomfort and disease.</p>

<p id="id01372" class="calibre1">These hints, simple as they are, contain enough information to rob
gestation and childbirth of their horrors, if they are intelligently
observed. If civilized woman desires to be as painfree as the savage,
she must lead the simple life.</p>

<h4 id="id01373" class="calibre14">INFANCY.</h4>

<p id="id01374" class="calibre1">If the baby lives to be one year old, its chances of surviving are
fairly good, but during the first year the mortality is appalling.
Complete statistics are not available, but in places one-fifth or even
one-fourth of the babies born perish during this time. The mortality is
chiefly due to overfeeding and giving food of poor quality.</p>

<p id="id01375" class="calibre1">The average parent loves his baby. He loves the helpless little thing to
death. In Oscar Wilde's words, "We kill the thing we love." The babies
are killed by too much love, which takes the form of overindulgence.
About thirty years ago the well known physician, Charles B. Page, wrote:</p>

<p id="id01376" class="calibre1">"How many healthy-born infants die before their first year is
reached—babies that for months are mistakenly regarded as pictures of
health—'never knew a sick day until they were attacked' with cholera
infantum, scarletina, or something else. They are crammed with food,
made gross with fat, and for a time are active and cunning, the delight
of parents and friends—and then, after a season of constipation, a
season of chronic vomiting, and a season of cholera infantum, the little
emaciated skeletons are buried in the ground away from the sight of
those who have literally loved them to death. This is the fate of
one-third of all the children born. As a rule, babies are fed as an
ignorant servant feeds the cook-stove—filling the fire-box so full,
often, that the covers are raised, the stove smokes and gases at every
hole, and the fire is either put out altogether, or, if there is
combustion of the whole body of coals, the stove is rapidly burned out
and destroyed. With baby, overheating means the fever that consumes him,
and, in putting out the fire, too often the fire of life goes out also."</p>

<p id="id01377" class="calibre1">Fat babies are thought to be healthy babies. This is a mistake, for the
fatter the baby, the more liable it is to fill an early grave.
Thoughtful, knowing people realize that a child that weighs eight pounds
or more at birth is an indication of maternal law breaking. Both the
mother and the child will have to pay for this sooner or later.
Overweight is a handicap. It prevents complete internal cleansing and
combustion, without which health is impossible.</p>

<p id="id01378" class="calibre1">Because of the false ideas prevalent regarding weight of infants, it is
well to put a little emphasis on the subject. If the mother has lived
right during pregnancy, the child is often light at birth, sometimes
five pounds or less. The average doctor will shake his head and say that
the baby's chance to live is very small. The friends, neighbors and
relatives will say the same. They are wrong. Let the parents remember
that light children are not encumbered with fat, and rarely with
disease. A light baby is generally all healthy baby, and if properly
cared for and not overfed will thrive. Parents of such babies should be
thankful, instead of being alarmed.</p>

<p id="id01379" class="calibre1">It is not natural for babies to weigh nine or ten pounds at birth, and
when they do it is a sign of maternal wrong doing, whether she has been
cognizant of it or not. Babies should not be fat, nor should they be fat
when they grow older, if the best results are desired.</p>

<p id="id01380" class="calibre1">In babies it is better to strive for quality than for quantity.</p>

<p id="id01381" class="calibre1">Every mother who is capable of doing so should nurse her baby. There is
no food to take the place of the mother's milk. The babies build greater
strength and resistance when they are fed naturally than when they are
brought up on the bottle. Babies thrive wonderfully in an atmosphere of
love, and they draw love from the mother's breast with every swallow.</p>

<p id="id01382" class="calibre1">From the information available, which is not as complete and definite as
could be desired, it appears that from six to thirteen bottle-babies die
during the first year where only one breast-fed child perishes. The
bottle-baby does not get a fair start. If a mother is ill and worn out
she should not be asked to nurse the baby. If the mother has fever she
should not risk the baby's health through nursing. Some mothers do not
have enough milk to feed the baby. Nearly all who live properly give
enough milk to nourish their infants at first. If there is not enough
milk, the child should be allowed to take what there is in the breasts
and this should be supplemented with cow's milk.</p>

<p id="id01383" class="calibre1">Dr. Thomas F. Harrington said recently:</p>

<p id="id01384" class="calibre1">"From 80 to 90 per cent. of all deaths from gastrointestinal disease
among infants takes place in the artificially fed; or ten bottle-babies
die to one which is breast-fed. In institutions it has been found that
the death rate is frequently from 90 to 100 per cent. when babies are
separated from their mothers. During the siege of Paris (1870-71) the
women were compelled to nurse their own babies on account of the absence
of cow's milk. Infant mortality under one year fell from 33 to 7 per
cent. During the cotton famine of 1860 women were not at work in the
mills. They nursed their babies and one-half of the infant mortality
disappeared."</p>

<p id="id01385" class="calibre1">These are remarkable facts and bring home at least two truths. First,
they confirm the superiority of natural feeding over that of artificial
feeding. Second, they show that when the mother is not overfed the
infants are healthier. During the siege of Paris food was scarce in that
city. People of all classes had to live quite frugally. They could not
overeat as in the untroubled time of peace and prosperity, and the
result was that both the mothers and the babies were healthier. The
infant mortality was only a little over one-fifth of what it was
previously. If the French people had heeded the lesson the statesmen and
philosophers of that nation would not today have to worry about its
almost stationary population.</p>

<p id="id01386" class="calibre1">It would be much better if fewer children were born and those few were
healthier. What good does the birth of the army of 425,000 children
which perishes annually accomplish? It leaves the nation poorer in every
way. A mother tired and worn with wakeful vigils, and at last left with
an aching heart through the loss of her child, is not worth as much as
she who has a crooning infant to love, and through her mother-love
radiates kindness and good cheer to others. The conditions that weed out
so many of our infants tend to weaken the survivors.</p>

<p id="id01387" class="calibre1">It costs too much to bring children into the world to waste them so
lavishly. This may sound peculiar, but it is enlightened selfishness,
which is the highest good, for it brings blessings upon all.</p>

<p id="id01388" class="calibre1">Artificial feeding lays the foundation for many troubles which may not
manifest for several years. The bottle-fed babies are often plump, even
fat, but they are not as strong as those who are fed naturally. They
take all kinds of children's diseases very quickly. The glandular
system, which is so readily disturbed in children, is more easily
affected in bottle-fed babies. And so it comes about that they often
have swollen salivary glands, or swelling of the glands of the neck or
of the tonsils.</p>

<p id="id01389" class="calibre1">Do not be in a hurry to feed the baby after birth. Nature has so
arranged that the infant does not require immediate feeding. It is a
good plan to wait at least twenty-four hours after birth before placing
the baby at the breast, for then all the tumult and excitement have had
a chance to subside.</p>

<p id="id01390" class="calibre1">Many give the baby a cathartic within a few hours after birth. This is a
mistake. Cathartics are irritants and it is a very poor beginning to
abuse the mucous membrane of the intestinal tract immediately. This
mucous membrane is delicate and in children the digestive apparatus is
easily upset. Before birth there was no stomach or bowel digestion, all
the nutritive processes taking place in the tissues of the little body.
Gentle treatment is necessary to bring the best results. Cathartics with
their harsh action on the delicate membranes are contraindicated. The
mother's first milk is cathartic enough to stimulate the bowels to act,
but it is nature's cathartic and does no harm.</p>

<p id="id01391" class="calibre1">As a rule the baby is fed too often and too much from the time of birth.
If the child appears healthy the physician's recommendation will
probably be to feed every two hours day and night, or every two hours
during the day and every three hours at night. If the little one appears
weakly these feedings are increased in number. From ten to twenty-four
feedings in twenty-four hours are not uncommon and sometimes infants are
nursed or given the bottle two and even three times an hour. The excuse
for this is that the baby's stomach is small and cannot hold much food
at a time and must for this reason be filled often, for the baby has to
grow, and the more food it gets the faster it grows.  The baby's stomach
is small, because the little one needs very little food.  The human
being grows and develops for twenty to twenty-five years. This growth is
slow and during babyhood the amount of nourishment needed is not great.
The child, if properly taken care of, is kept warm. Hence it needs but
little fuel. The ideas on food needs are so exaggerated that it is hard
for parents to realize what moderate amount of food will keep a baby
well nourished.</p>

<p id="id01392" class="calibre1">An adult in the best of health would be unable to stand such frequent
food intake.  He would be ill in a short time. Babies stand it no
better, and the only proof of this fact needed is that in the United
States at least 280,000 babies under one year of age perish annually.
During babyhood nearly all troubles are nutritive ones. With the stomach
and bowels in excellent condition baby defies all kinds of diseases,
provided it is given the simple, commonsense attentions needed
otherwise, such as being kept warm and clean in a well ventilated room.
With a healthy alimentary canal, which comes with proper feeding, the
little one can withstand the attack of the vast horde of germs which so
trouble adult minds, also adult bodies, when people fail to give
themselves proper care.</p>

<p id="id01393" class="calibre1">The results of too frequent feeding and overfeeding are appalling.  The
first ill effect is digestive disturbance. Then one or more of the ills
of childhood make their appearance. These are called diseases, but they
are only symptoms of perverted nutrition, though we insist on giving
them names.</p>

<p id="id01394" class="calibre1">A healthy baby is one that is absolutely normal and well in every way.
However, babies today pass for healthy when they are fat and suffering
from all kinds of troubles, provided these ills can be tolerated. We
need a new standard of health. Perfect health is a gift that every
normal parent can bestow upon his children, and we should be satisfied
with nothing short of this. Babies can and should be raised without
illness, but, sad to relate, babies, who are always healthy are so rare
that they are curiosities.</p>

<p id="id01395" class="calibre1">Many babies show signs of maternal overfeeding within a few hours or
days of birth. One of the common signs is the discharge from the nose.
This is aggravated by overfeeding the infant. And thus is laid the
foundation, perhaps, for a lifelong catarrh. In due time various
diseases such as rickets, swollen glands, formerly called scrofulous,
mumps, measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria, pimples, eczema and cholera
infantum, make their appearance. Parents have been taught to look for
these diseases. They have been told that they belong to childhood. This
is a libel on nature, for she tends in the direction of health.</p>

<p id="id01396" class="calibre1">The prevalent idea at present is that various germs, which are found in
water, food, air and earth, are responsible for these diseases, but they
are not. The fact that infants properly cared for do not develop one of
them is proof enough that germs per se are unable to cause these ills.
The germs play their part in most of these diseases, but it is a kindly
part. They are scavengers, and attempt to rid the body of its debris and
poisons. Through false reasoning they are blamed for causing disease,
when in fact their multiplication is an effect. They are a by-product of
disease. The so-called pathogenic bacteria never thrive in the baby's
body until the infant has been overfed or fed on improper food long
enough to break down its resistance.</p>

<p id="id01397" class="calibre1">The improper feeding not only kills an army of babies each year, but it
handicaps the survivors very seriously. The degenerated condition of the
system leaves every child with some kind of weakness. The foundation may
be laid for indigestion, catarrhal troubles, which may or may not be
accompanied with adenoids and impeded breathing, glandular troubles,
often precursors of tuberculosis, in fact children may be acquiring any
disease during infancy from chronic catarrh to rheumatism.</p>

<p id="id01398" class="calibre1">Mental ills are also results of senseless feeding. A healthy baby is
happy. A sick baby is cross. Crossness and anger are mental perversions.
Anger is temporary insanity. Enough overfeeding often results in mental
perversity, epilepsy and even in real insanity. A healthy body gives a
healthy mind. If people would care for their bodies properly, especially
in the line of eating, the asylums for the insane would not be needed
for their present purposes.</p>

<p id="id01399" class="calibre1">Another serious trouble that takes root from infant overfeeding is an
abnormal craving for stimulants. This craving may later on be satisfied
in many ways. Some use coffee, alcohol, habit-forming drugs. Others try
to satisfy it by overeating. No matter how the sufferer proceeds to
satisfy this craving, he does not cure it, for it grows upon what it is
fed. Morphine calls for more morphine. Tobacco calls for more tobacco.
An oversupply of food calls for more food or alcohol. The victim at last
dies a martyr to his abnormal appetites.</p>

<p id="id01400" class="calibre1">Comparatively few of those who see the error of their ways have the will
power to thrust off the shackles of habit. Very few think clearly enough
and go far enough back to realize that disease and early death are so
largely due to the habits formed for the infant or unborn babe by the
parents. And the parents received the same kind of undesirable legacy
from their parents, and so it goes, the children suffering for the sins
of the parents. The cheerful part of such a retrospect is that there is
much room for improvement, that we need not continue this seemingly
unending chain of physical bondage to the next generation, and that if
the children are not born right or treated right during infancy, there
is still time to make a change for the better. Nature is kind and with
will and determination a change can be made at any time that will result
in betterment, provided such grave diseases have not taken hold of the
body that recuperation is impossible. This is no excuse for making
delays, for the longer errors are permitted the harder they are to
overcome.</p>

<p id="id01401" class="calibre1">Three or four feedings a day are sufficient for any baby. The feedings
should be arranged so that they are evenly distributed during the day,
and nothing is to be given at night except water. Get a nursing bottle
or two. Keep the bottles and the nipples scrupulously clean. These are
to be used as water bottles. The water must also be clean. Heat it to
103 or 104 degrees Fahrenheit, so that it will be from 98 to 100 degrees
warm when it enters the baby's mouth Let the baby have some water three
or four times during the day, and perhaps it will want some once or
twice during the night, but give it no milk at night.</p>

<p id="id01402" class="calibre1">Overfed babies are irritable and cry often. The mothers interpret this
as a sign of hunger. Most babies do not know what hunger is. Like adults
they become thirsty, but instead of getting water to quench their thirst
they are given milk. This satisfies for a little while, then the
irritability due to milk spoiled, in the alimentary tract causes more
restlessness and crying, and they are fed again. The comedy of errors
continues until it is turned into a tragedy.</p>

<p id="id01403" class="calibre1">How much should the baby be fed at a time? When the parents are healthy
and the baby is born right and then fed but three times a day, the food
intake will regulate itself. The child will not usually want more than
it should have of milk, supplemented with water. The best way to begin
is to let the infant take what it desires. That is, let the nursing
continue while the infant manifests great pleasure and zest. When the
child begins to fool with the breast or bottle, the source of
nourishment should be removed immediately. The child will increase its
intake gradually.</p>

<p id="id01404" class="calibre1">Some of the babies will take too much. The evil results will soon be
evident, and then the mother must not compromise, but reduce the intake
at once. The signs of over-consumption of food by the infants are the
same as those shown by adults. They are discomfort and disease. The
former manifests in crossness and irritability. The disease may be of
any kind, ranging from a rash to a high fever.</p>

<p id="id01405" class="calibre1">The baby's stomach is sensitive and resents the excessive amount of food
supplied. So the infant often vomits curdled milk, and some times vomits
before the milk has time to curdle. This is a form of self-protection.
If the mother would heed this sign by withdrawing all food until the
stomach is settled, substituting water in the meanwhile, and then reduce
the baby's food to within digestive capacity, there would be no more
trouble. Vomiting is the infant's way of saying, "Please do not feed me
until my stomach becomes normal again, and then don't give me more than
I need, and that is less than I have been getting." Remember that it is
nature's sign language, which never misleads, and it is so plain that
any one with ordinary understanding should get its meaning, in spite of
the erroneous popular teachings. After the child has vomited, feed
moderately and increase its food supply as its digestive ability
increases.</p>

<p id="id01406" class="calibre1">If the vomiting is wrongly interpreted and overfeeding is continued,
either the baby dies or the stomach establishes a toleration, passing
the trouble on to other parts of the body. One organ never suffers long
alone. The circulation passes the disease on to other parts, assisted by
the sympathetic nerves, which are present in all parts of the body.</p>

<p id="id01407" class="calibre1">When the stomach has established its toleration, several things may
happen, only a few of which will be discussed, for the process is
essentially the same, though the results appear so different. In infants
whose digestive power is not very strong the excessive amount of milk
curdles, as does the part that is digested. The water of the milk is
absorbed, but the curds pass into the colon without being digested and
they are discharged in the stool as curds. They are partly decomposed on
the journey through the alimentary canal, producing poisons, a part of
which is absorbed. A part remains in the colon, making the bowel
discharges very offensive.</p>

<p id="id01408" class="calibre1">The passage of curds in the stool is a danger signal indicating
overfeeding and should be heeded immediately. If it is not, the chances
for a ease of cholera infantum, especially in warm weather, are great.
Cholera infantum is due to overfeeding, or the use of inferior milk, or
both. It is a form of milk poisoning, in which the bowels are very
irritable. As a matter of self-protection they throw out a large
quantity of serum, which soon depletes the system of the poor little
sufferer, and death too often claims another young life. If cholera
infantum makes its appearance the baby is given its best chance to live
if feeding is stopped immediately, warm water given whenever desired,
but not too large quantities at a time. Give no cathartics, for they
irritate an already seriously disturbed mucous membrane, but give a
small enema of blood-warm water once or twice a day. Keep the baby
comfortable, seeing that the feet and abdomen are kept warm, but give
plenty of fresh air. Medicines only aggravate a malady that is already
serious enough. This disease is produced by abuse so grave that in spite
of the best nursing, the baby often dies. It is easily prevented.</p>

<p id="id01409" class="calibre1">Strong babies with great digestive power are often able to digest and
assimilate enormous quantities of milk, several quarts a day. They can
not use all this food. If they could their size would be enormous within
a short time. They do not find it so easy to excrete the excess as to
assimilate it. The skin, kidneys, lungs and the bowels find themselves
overtaxed. Often the mucous membrane of the nose and throat are called
upon to assist in the elimination. These are the babies who are said to
catch cold easily. Their colds are not caught. They are fed to them.
This constant abuse of the mucous membrane results in inflammation,
subacute in nature, or it may be so mild that it is but an irritation.
The result in time may be chronic catarrh or thickening of the mucous
membrane of nose and throat. While the catarrh is being firmly
established adenoids are quite common.</p>

<p id="id01410" class="calibre1">In other cases too much of the work of excretion is thrown upon the
skin. The same thing happens to this structure as happens to the mucous
membrane. It is made for a limited amount of excretion and when more
foreign matter, much of it of a very irritating nature, is deposited for
elimination through the skin, it becomes inflamed. It itches. In a
little while there is an attack of eczema. The baby scratches, digging
its little nails in with a will. The infant soon has its face covered
with sores and the scalp is scaly. The proper thing to do is to reduce
the feeding greatly. Then the acid-producing fermentation in stomach and
bowels will cease, but enough food to nourish the body will be absorbed,
the skin will have but its normal work to perform, the cause of the
irritation is gone and the effects will disappear in a short time. Two
weeks are often sufficient to bring back the smooth, soft skin that
every baby should have. The sufferers from these troubles are almost
invariably overweight, and the parents wonder why their babies, who are
so healthy, should be troubled thus!</p>

<p id="id01411" class="calibre1">Mothers owe it to their nursing babies to lead wholesome, simple lives.
It is not always possible to live ideally, but every mother can eat
simply and control her temper. Wholesome food and equanimity will go far
toward producing healthful nourishment for the child. Stimulants and
narcotics should be avoided. Meat should not be eaten more than once a
day, and it would be better to use less meat and more eggs or nuts.
Fresh fruits and vegetables should be partaken of daily. They are the
rejuvenators and purifiers. The cereal foods should be as near natural
as possible. The bread should be made of whole wheat flour mostly. If
rice is eaten it should be unpolished. Refined sugar should be taken in
moderation, if at all. The potatoes are best baked. Pure milk is as good
for the mother as it is for the child. Highly seasoned foods or rich
made dishes should be avoided. In short, the mother should live as near
naturally as possible.</p>

<p id="id01412" class="calibre1">The importance of cheerfulness can hardly be overestimated. A nervous
mother who frets or worries, or becomes mastered by any of the negative,
depressing passions, poisons her babe a little with each drop of milk
the child takes.</p>

<p id="id01413" class="calibre1">Some mothers are unable to nurse their babies. This is so because of
lack of knowledge principally, for women who give themselves proper care
are nearly always able to furnish nourishment for their infants. It may
be that this function will be largely lost if the present preponderance
of artificial feeding continues, and if various inoculations are not
stopped. Some mothers find it a great pleasure to nurse their babies.
Others refuse to do so for fear of ruining their figures.</p>

<p id="id01414" class="calibre1">No matter what the reason is for depriving the infant of its natural
food, the parents should realize that its chances for health and life
are diminished by this act. If intelligence and care are used in raising
the bottle-fed babies only a few will die, in fact none will die under
the circumstances, provided they were born with a normal amount of
resistance. So it behooves parents of such babies to be extremely
careful. That there are difficulties in the way, or rather
inconveniences, can not be denied, but there are no insurmountable
obstacles.</p>

<p id="id01415" class="calibre1">The best common substitute for mother's milk is cow's milk. If clean and
given in moderation it will agree with the child and produce no untoward
results.</p>

<p id="id01416" class="calibre1">Instead of using the same bottle all the time, there should be a number,
so that there will be plenty of time to clean them. If three feeds are
given each day, there should be six bottles. If four feeds are given,
eight bottles. Use a set every other day. The bottles should be rinsed
out after being used. Then boil them in water containing soda or a
little lye, rinse in several waters and set them aside. If it is sunny,
let them stand in the sun. Before using, rinse again in sterile water.
The nipples should have equally good care. In feeding babies cleanliness
comes before godliness.</p>

<p id="id01417" class="calibre1">Each bottle is to be used for but one feeding, and as many bottles are
to be prepared as there are to be feedings for the day.</p>

<p id="id01418" class="calibre1">If the people live in the country it is easy to get pure milk. If in the
city one should make arrangements with a reliable milk man possessed of
a conscience. It is well to get the milk from a certain cow, instead of
taking a mixture coming from many cows. Select a healthy animal that
does not give very rich milk, such as the Holstein. She should have what
green food she wants every day, grass in summer, and hay of the best
quality and silage in winter. The grain ration should be moderate, for
cows that are forced undergo quick degeneration. They are burned out.
The cow should not be worried or whipped. She should be allowed to be
happy, and animals are happy if they are treated properly. The water
supply should be clean, not from one of the filthy tubs or troughs which
disgrace some farms. The barn should be light and well ventilated. It
should be kept clean and free from the ammonia fumes which are found in
filthy stables. The cow should be brushed and the udder washed before
each milking. The milker should wash his hands and have on clothes from
which no impurities will fall. The first part of the milk drawn should
not be put in with that which is to supply the baby. The milk should be
drawn into a clean receptacle and immediately strained through sterile
surgeon's cotton into glass bottles. These are to be put aside to cool,
the contents not exposed to the dust falling from the air. Or the milk
may be put directly into the nursing bottles and put aside in a cold
place until needed. Then warm milk to 100 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p id="id01419" class="calibre1">Pardon a little repetition: If possible let the child nurse. If there is
not enough milk, let the baby take what there is and give cow's milk in
addition. If it is impossible to feed the baby at the breast, get the
milk from a healthy cow that is kept clean, well fed and well treated.
The cow's milk should be prepared as follows: Take equal parts of milk
and water. Or take two parts of milk and one part of water. Mix, and to
this may be added sugar of milk in the proportion of one level
teaspoonful to the quart. Before feeding raise the temperature of the
milk to about 104 degrees Fahrenheit, so that it will be about 100
degrees when fed. It is best to do the warming in a water bath.</p>

<p id="id01420" class="calibre1">Milk should not be kept long before being used. Limit the age to
thirty-six hours after being drawn from the cow. Twenty-four hours would
be better. The evening milk can safely be given to the infant the next
day, if proper precautions have been taken. Ordinary milk is quite
filthy and upon this babies do not thrive. Make an effort to get clean
milk for the baby.</p>

<p id="id01421" class="calibre1">The composition of human milk and cow's milk is about as follows:</p>

<p id="id01422" class="calibre1">  ====================================================================<br class="calibre12"/>

                    Water     Albumin     Fat     Sugar     Salts<br class="calibre12"/>

  ——————————————————————————————————<br class="calibre12"/>

  Human ……….  87.58        2.01    3.74      6.37       .30<br class="calibre12"/>

  Cow's ……….  87.27        3.39    3.68      4.97       .72<br class="calibre12"/>

  ——————————————————————————————————<br class="calibre12"/>
</p>

<p id="id01423" class="calibre1">The albumin in human milk is largely of a kind which is not coagulated
by souring, while nearly all the albumin in cow's milk coagulates. The
uncoagulated albumin is digested and taken up more easily by the baby's
nutritive system than that which is coagulated. This is one of the
reasons that babies do not thrive so well on cow's milk as on their
natural food.</p>

<p id="id01424" class="calibre1">The sugar of milk is not like refined sugar. Although it is not so
easily dissolved in water, and therefore does not taste as sweet as
refined sugar, it is better for the child. If sugar is added to the
milk, milk sugar should be used. The druggists have it in powder form.</p>

<p id="id01425" class="calibre1">The addition of barley water and lime to the baby's milk is folly. The
various forms of modified milk do not give as good results as the
addition of water and a little milk sugar, as previously described. If
you believe in such modifications as the top milk method and the
addition of starchy substances and lime water, I refer you to your
family physician or text-books on infant feeding.</p>

<p id="id01426" class="calibre1">It is difficult to improve on good cow's milk. It is well to remember
that the human organism is very adaptable, even in infancy. The
principal factors in infant feeding are cleanliness and moderation.</p>

<p id="id01427" class="calibre1">Bottle-fed babies should be given fruit or vegetable juices, or both,
very early and it would be well to give a little of these juices to
breast-fed babies too. The latter do not require as much as the former.
Begin during the first month with a teaspoonful of orange juice put into
the drinking bottle once a day. Increase gradually until at four or five
months the amount may be from one to two tablespoonfuls. Do not be
afraid to give the orange juice because it is acid, for it splits up
quickly in the stomach and is rearranged, forming alkaline salts. It is
the fruit that can be obtained at nearly all seasons. It is best to get
mild oranges and strain the juice. The fruit is to be in prime
condition. Instead of orange juice, the juice of raw celery, spinach,
cabbage, apples, blackberries and other juicy fruits and vegetables may
be employed, but these juices must all come from fruits or vegetables
that are in prime condition. No sugar is to be added to either the fruit
or the vegetable juices.</p>

<p id="id01428" class="calibre1">The mother's milk coagulates in small flakes, easily acted upon by the
digestive juices, after which they are readily absorbed. Cow's milk
coagulates into rather large pieces of albumin which are tough and
therefore rather difficult to digest. This happens when the milk is
taken rapidly and undiluted. However, when diluted and taken slowly this
tendency is overcome to a great degree. For this reason it is best to
get nipples with small perforations.</p>

<p id="id01429" class="calibre1">Either pasteurization or sterilization of milk is almost universally
recommended by medical men. Even those who do not believe in such
procedures generally fail to condemn them without qualifying statements.
For a discussion of this fallacy I refer you to the chapter on milk.</p>

<p id="id01430" class="calibre1">Do not give the little ones any kinds of medicines. They always do harm
and never any good. If any exception is made to this, it is in the line
of laxatives or mild cathartics, such as small doses of castor oil,
cascara segrada or mineral waters, but there is no excuse for giving
metallic remedies, such as calomel. If the babies are fed in moderation
on good foods they will not become constipated. If they are imprudently
handled and become constipated it is necessary to resort to either the
enema or some mild cathartic. Bear in mind that such remedies do not
cure. They only relieve. The cure will come when the errors of life are
corrected so that the body is able to perform its work without being
obstructed.</p>

<p id="id01431" class="calibre1">Inoculations and vaccinations are serious blunders, often fatal. The
animal products that are rubbed or injected into the little body are
poisonous. They are the result of degenerative changes—diseases—in the
bodies of rabbits, horses, cows and other animals. Nature's law is that
health must be deserved or earned. Health means cleanliness, so it
really is absurd to force into the body these products of animal decay.
Statistics can be given, showing how beneficial these agents are, but
they are misleading. In the days of public and official belief in
witchcraft it was not difficult to prove the undoubted existence of
witches. Whatever the public accepts as true can with the utmost ease be
bolstered up with figures.</p>

<p id="id01432" class="calibre1">The use of serums, bacterins, vaccines and other products of the
biologic laboratory is almost an obsession today. Their curative and
preventive values are taken for granted. Most of the time the children
are strong enough to throw off the poisons without showing prolonged or
pronounced effects, but every once in a while a child is so poisoned
that it takes months for it to regain health and too often death is the
end. Sometimes the death takes place a few minutes after the injection,
but we are informed that the medication had nothing to do with it. To
poison the baby's blood deliberately is criminal. Give the little one a
fair chance to live in health. A properly cared for baby will not be ill
for one single day. Knowledge and good care will prevent sickness.</p>

<p id="id01433" class="calibre1">A baby that is able to remain well a month or a week or a day can remain
well every day.</p>

<p id="id01434" class="calibre1">At first a normal baby sleeps nearly all the time, from twenty to
twenty-two hours a day. The infant should not be disturbed. All that
should be done for it is to feed it three times a day, give it some
water from the bottle three or four times a day, and keep it clean, dry
and warm, but not hot.</p>

<p id="id01435" class="calibre1">Most babies are bathed daily. This is all right, but the baths are to be
given quickly. The water should be about 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The
soap should be of the mildest, such as a good grade of castile, and it
should be well rinsed off, for soap permitted to remain in the pores
acts as an irritant. Dry the skin so well with a soft cloth that there
will be no chapping or roughness. Sores, eruptions and inflammations are
signs of mismanagement. Use no powders that are metallic in character,
such as zinc oxide. A dusting powder of finely ground talcum is good. If
the child is kept dry and dean and moderately fed the skin will remain
in good condition.</p>

<p id="id01436" class="calibre1">Babies do not thrive without good air. Keep the room well ventilated at
all times by admitting fresh air from a source that will produce no
draughts. It is not necessary to have the baby's room warm. In fact a
cool room is better. When the child is to be exposed to the air, take it
into a warm room. Soft coverings will keep the infant warm. The limbs
should be free so that exercise can be had through unrestricted
movements.</p>

<p id="id01437" class="calibre1">The baby should not be bothered unnecessarily. Young parents make the
mistake of using the baby for show purposes. For the sake of politeness,
others praise the "only baby in the world" unduly, though there are
millions of others just as good. Let the child alone, thus giving it an
opportunity to become as superior as the parents think it is. The
showing off process creates excitement and lays the foundation for
fretfulness, irritability and nervousness. The child thrives in a
peaceful atmosphere. When it is awake it is well to talk to it quietly
and soothingly, for thus the infant begins to learn its mother's tongue.
Good language should be employed. Those who teach their children
baby-talk are handicapping them, for they will soon have to unlearn this
and learn real language. Baby-talk may be "cute" at eighteen months, but
when children retain that mode of expression beyond the age of four or
five it sounds silly.</p>

<p id="id01438" class="calibre1">At about the age of nine or ten months the breast-fed babe should be
weaned. Gradual weaning is perhaps the best. First give one feeding of
cow's milk a day and two breast feeds; then two feedings of cow's milk
and one at the breast, and at last cow's milk entirely. Between the ages
of nine and twelve months begin giving starchy foods. At first the child
will take very little, and gradually increase. Give bread so stale that
the child has to soak it with its saliva before it can swallow the
bread. Working away this way, sucking the stale bread, the child learns
to go through the motions of chewing, and this is valuable training.
Never give bread soaked in milk and never feed milk while bread is being
eaten. If the meal is to be bread and milk, give the bread either before
any milk is taken, or afterwards. Starches are not to be washed down
with liquids.  Instead of giving stale bread, zwieback may be used.
Occasionally feed a few spoons of very thin and well cooked oatmeal or
whole wheat gruel, but the less sloppy food given the better, for it
does not get the proper mouth treatment. The wheat products fed the
child should be made from whole wheat flour, or at least three-fourths
whole wheat and only one-fourth of the white flour. The refined flour is
lacking in the salts that the child needs for health and growth.</p>

<p id="id01439" class="calibre1">Many mothers begin feeding starches when the baby is four or five months
old. The child is given potatoes, bread or any other starchy food that
may be on the table. This is a mistake, for the child is not prepared to
digest starches at that early age. Some of the digestive ferments are
practically absent during the first few months of life. Such feeding
will invariably cause trouble. The baby should not be taken to the
table.</p>

<p id="id01440" class="calibre1">It is quite generally believed that a baby should cry to exercise its
lungs. A healthy, comfortable baby will do little or no crying, and it
is not necessary. It is not difficult to give the little ones some
exercise to fill their lungs. Babies can hang on to a finger or a thin
rod tenaciously. Elevate the infant that does not cry thus a few times
above the bed and let it hang for a few seconds each time. This throws
the chest forward and exercises the lungs. What is more, this small
amount of gymnastic work is thoroughly enjoyed. It helps to build
strength and good temper. The crying helps to make the baby ill-tempered
and fretful. A little crying now and then is all right, but much
indicates discomfort, disease or a spoiled child. It would surprise most
mothers how good babies are when they have a chance to be good.</p>

<p id="id01441" class="calibre1">After reading this, some are sure to ask how many ounces to feed the
baby. I don't know. No one else knows. Different babies have different
requirements. The key is given above. If the babies become ill it is
nearly always due to overfeeding and poor food, so the proper thing to
do is to reduce the food intake.</p>

<p id="id01442" class="calibre1">A healthy baby is a source of unending joy, while a sick one saps the
mother's vitality. It is too bad that the art of efficient child culture
is so little known.</p>

<h4 id="id01443" class="calibre14">CHILDHOOD.</h4>

<p id="id01444" class="calibre1">Children may roughly be divided into two types, the robust and the more
delicate or nervous ones. The robust children can stand almost all kinds
of abuse with no apparent harm resulting, but the immunity is only
apparent. The growing child naturally throws off disease influences
easily and quickly, but if the handicap is too great the child loses out
in the race.</p>

<p id="id01445" class="calibre1">The nervous type can not be abused with impunity, for the bodies of
these delicately balanced children are easily disturbed. They must have
more intelligent care than is usually bestowed upon the robust type. If
the care is not forthcoming they become weak in body, with an unstable
nervous system, or perish early.</p>

<p id="id01446" class="calibre1">Some parents complain because other people's children can do what their
own can not and they wonder why. No time should be wasted in making such
comparisons, for no two children are exactly alike, as no two leaves and
not even two such apparently similar objects as grains of wheat are
exactly alike. Therefore the care necessary varies somewhat, though it
is basically the same.</p>

<p id="id01447" class="calibre1">If the nervous type is given proper care, good health will be the
result. These children do not tolerate as much exposure or as much food
as do the robust children. The important thing is to learn what they
require and then see that there is no excess, and in this way allow the
child to grow physically strong and mentally efficient.</p>

<p id="id01448" class="calibre1">The delicate children are perhaps more fortunate than the stronger ones,
for they learn early in life that they have limitations. If they commit
excesses the results are so disagreeable that they soon learn to be
prudent. This prudence serves as protection so long as life lasts.</p>

<p id="id01449" class="calibre1">The robust children on the other hand soon learn that they are strong.
They hear their parents boast about it. They get the idea that because
they are strong they will always remain so, that nothing will do them
any serious harm. By living up to this fallacy they undermine their
constitutions. Parents should teach their children about the law of
compensation as applied to health, that is, he has permanent health who
deserves it, and no one else. The children will not always heed true
teachings after they have left the parental influence, but the parents
have at least done the best they could.</p>

<p id="id01450" class="calibre1">The robust children have their troubles, such as chicken-pox, mumps,
fevers and measles, but these are thrown off so quickly and with so
little inconvenience that they are soon forgotten. As a rule the parents
do not realize that these diseases are due to faulty nutrition, and that
faulty nutrition is caused by improper feeding. It is generally believed
that children must have all the so-called children's diseases. Some
mothers expose their infants to all of these that may happen to be in
the neighborhood, hoping that the children will take them and be through
with them.</p>

<p id="id01451" class="calibre1">Every time a child is sick it is a reflection on either the intelligence
or the performance of the parents. It is natural for children to be
perfectly well, and they will remain in that happy state if they are
given the opportunity. If they are properly fed they will not take any
of the children's diseases in spite of repeated exposure. There is not a
disease germ known to medical science strong enough to establish itself
in the system of an uninjured, healthy child and do damage. The child's
health must first be impaired, through poor care, and then the so-called
disease germs will find a hospitable dwelling place. If children are
given natural food in normal quantities they are disease-proof. Feeding
them on refined sugar and white flour products, pasteurized or
sterilized milk, potatoes fried in grease pickled meats, and various
other ruined foods breaks down their resistance and then they fall an
easy prey to disease.</p>

<p id="id01452" class="calibre1">Some parents make the mistake of believing that they can feed their
children improperly and ward off disease by vaccinations or inoculations
of the products of disease taken from various animals. This is contrary
to reason, common sense and nature and it is impossible. Any individual
who is continually abused in any way, be he infant or adult, will
deteriorate. If the disease is not the one that has been feared, it will
be some other one.</p>

<p id="id01453" class="calibre1">The robust children generally develop into careless adults. That is why
so many of them, in fact the vast majority, die before they are fifty
years old, although they are equipped with constitutions that were
intended to last over a century. They are shining marks for typhoid
fever, Bright's disease, various forms of heart and liver troubles,
rheumatism and pneumonia, all of which are largely caused by too hearty
eating. These diseases often come without apparent warning. That is, the
victims have thought themselves healthy. However, they have not known
what real health is. They have been in a state of tolerable health, not
suffering any very annoying aches or pains, but they have lacked the
normal state of body which results in a clear, keen mind. As a rule
there is enough indigestion present to cause gas in the bowels and a
coated tongue. Enough food is generally eaten to produce excessive blood
pressure.</p>

<p id="id01454" class="calibre1">The foundation for such a state of affairs is laid in childhood, yes,
often before the child is born. It can readily be seen how important it
is for parents to impart a little sound health information to the
children. At least, they should teach them what health really is, which
many people do not know.</p>

<p id="id01455" class="calibre1">When these strong people become sick it is often difficult, or even
impossible, to do anything for them, for their habits are so gross and
have gained such a mastery that the patients will not or can not change
their ways.</p>

<p id="id01456" class="calibre1">The weaklings have a better chance to survive to old age, because many
of them learn to be careful early in life. In reading the lives of
eminent men who have lived long it is common to find that they were
never strong.</p>

<p id="id01457" class="calibre1">At the age of one year the baby is generally weaned. The ordinary child
needs the mother's milk no longer, for by this time the digestive power
is great enough to cope with cow's milk and various starches. The most
important problem now is how to feed the child. If no errors of
importance are made it will enjoy uninterrupted growth and health. If
the errors are many and serious there will surely be disease and too
often the abuse is so great that death comes and ends the suffering.</p>

<p id="id01458" class="calibre1">Until the child reaches the age of two years the best foods are milk,
whole wheat products and fruits. No other foods are necessary. The
simpler the baby's food, and the more naturally and plainly prepared,
the better. Adults who overeat until they suffer from jaded appetites,
may think that they need great variety of food, but it is never
necessary for infants or normal adults. Milk, whole wheat and fruits
contain all the elements needed for growth and strength and health. By
all means feed simply. Children are perfectly satisfied with bread and
milk or simply one kind of fruit at a meal, if they are properly
trained. The craving for a great variety of foods at each meal is due to
parental mismanagement.</p>

<p id="id01459" class="calibre1">Children should not be fed more than three times a day. There should be
no lunching. The children will get all that is good for them, all they
need in three meals. Candy should not be given between meals, and fruit
is to be looked upon as a food, not as a dainty to be consumed at all
hours of the day. If they are not accustomed to lunching, there will be
no craving for lunches. If children are used to four or five meals a day
they want them and raise annoying objections when deprived of one or two
of them. It is easy to get children into bad habits. We can not blame
the average mother for giving her children lunches, for she knows no
better and sees other mothers doing the same.</p>

<p id="id01460" class="calibre1">The children who do not get lunches thrive better than those who always
have candy, fruit or bread and jam at their command. It is the same with
adults. In the Dakotas and Minnesota are many Scandinavians and Germans.
During the haying and harvest these people, who are naturally very
strong, eat four and five times a day. The heat, the excessive amount of
food and the great quantities of coffee consumed cause much sickness
during and after the season of hard work and heroic eating. The
so-called Americans in these communities are generally satisfied with
three meals a day, and they are as well nourished and capable of working
as those who eat much more.</p>
