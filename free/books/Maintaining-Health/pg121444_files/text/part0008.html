    Refined sugar made from cane and beets should be given to children
sparingly. Refined sugar is the chemical which is largely responsible
for the perversion of children's tastes. A normal taste is very
desirable, for it protects the possessor. A perverted taste, on the
contrary, leads him into trouble. Sugar is not a good food. It is an
extract. It is easy to cultivate a desire for sugar, but to people who
are not accustomed to it, concentrated sugar has an unpleasant taste.</p>

<p id="id01462" class="calibre1">The perversion of the sense of taste, generally begun with sugar, is
made worse by the use of much salt, pepper and various condiments and
spices. If the child is fed on unnatural food, highly seasoned, at the
age of a few years its taste is so perverted that it does not know how
most of the common foods really taste, and refuses to eat the best of
them when the health-destroying concoctions to which it has been
accustomed can be had.</p>

<p id="id01463" class="calibre1">It is natural for children to relish fruit, but some are so perverted in
taste that they object to a meal of it if they can get pancakes or
waffles with butter and syrup, mushes with sugar and cream, ham or bacon
with fried potatoes, or fresh bread and meat with pickles. Many parents
allow their children to live on this class of food to the exclusion of
all natural foods. Children need a great deal of the natural salts, and
when they live so largely on denatured foods there is always physical
deterioration. It is true that to the average eye such children may
appear healthy, but they are not in one-half as good physical condition
as they could be.</p>

<p id="id01464" class="calibre1">Tea and coffee should never be given to children. They are bad enough
for adults. In children they retard bodily development. The stimulation
and sedation are bad for the nervous system. Coffee is as harmful as
tobacco for the growing child.</p>

<p id="id01465" class="calibre1">To warn against alcohol may seem foolish, but some parents really give
beer and whiskey to their infants. The beer is given as a beverage and
the whiskey as medicine to kill pain and soothe the children. Those who
have not seen children abused in this way may find it difficult to
believe that there is such a profundity of ignorance. These children die
easily.</p>

<p id="id01466" class="calibre1">Others quiet their children with the various soothing syrups. The last
analyses that came under my eyes showed that these remedies contained
considerable opium, laudanum, morphine and other deadly poisons.
Morphine and opium are not well borne by children and these "mother's
friends" have soothed many a baby into the sleep from which there is no
waking. Make it a rule to give the children no medicines, either patent
or those prescribed by physicians. Please remember that any remedy that
quiets a child is poisonous. Children who get proper care require no
medical quieting.</p>

<p id="id01467" class="calibre1">Condiments should not be used. Salt is not necessary despite the popular
belief to the contrary, though a small amount does no harm. Salt eating
is a habit and when carried to excess it is a bad one. Salt is a good
preservative, but there is little excuse for our using preserved foods
extensively. There are so many foods that can be had without being
preserved in this country that it would not be difficult to exclude
these inferior foods from the dietary. Children whose foods are not
seasoned do not desire seasoning, provided they are fed on natural foods
from the start. They want the seasoning because they are taught to eat
their food that way. If they are given fresh fruit every day, such as
apples, oranges, cherries, grapes and berries, they get all the
seasoning they need and they get it in natural form.</p>

<p id="id01468" class="calibre1">The objection is made that such feeding deprives children of many of the
good things of life. This is not true. Natural foods taste better than
the doctored ones every time. Nature imparts a flavor to food products
which man has never been able to equal, to say nothing of surpassing it.
Children are taught to like abnormal foods. What is better, to give
children good foods upon which they thrive, or denatured foods which
taste well to a perverted palate, but are injurious?</p>

<p id="id01469" class="calibre1">Instead of giving sugar or candy, give raisins, figs, dates or sweet
prunes. Small children may be given the strained juices of these fruits,
obtained either by soaking the raw fruits several hours or by stewing
them. Children who are given these fruits do not crave refined sugar.
They like these natural sugars better than the artificial extract. These
sweet fruits take the place of starchy food.</p>

<p id="id01470" class="calibre1">Very few people know anything definite about food values. Those who have
studied foods and their values in order to be able to feed children
properly generally make the mistake of believing that they should have
all the necessary elements at each meal in about the proper proportion.
This is a grave mistake and leads to trouble. The child needs salts,
protein, sugar and fat, and in the absence of sugar some starch. Milk
contains all these substances except starch. Give one fruit meal and two
meals of starch daily. Milk may be given with all the meals or it may be
given but once or twice. Do not overfeed on milk, for it is a rich food.</p>

<p id="id01471" class="calibre1">Until the child is two years old, confine it in its starch eating pretty
much to the products of whole wheat. Give no white bread. White bread is
an unsatisfying form of food. It is so tasteless and insipid and so
deprived of the natural wheat salts that too much has to be eaten to
satisfy. Children who would be satisfied with a reasonable amount of
whole wheat bread eat more white bread and still do not feel satisfied.
The same is true of rice, the natural brown rice being so superior to
the polished article that there is no comparison.</p>

<p id="id01472" class="calibre1">The bread should be toasted in the oven until it is crisp clear through,
or else it should be stale. Let the bread for toast get stale, and then
place it in the oven when this is cooling off. Make the slices
moderately thin. This is an easy and satisfactory way of making toast.
Scorched bread—what is usually called toast—is not fit food for young
children.</p>

<p id="id01473" class="calibre1">After the second year is completed gradually increase the variety of
starch. Some of the better forms of starch that are easy to obtain are:
Puffed rice or puffed wheat; brown, unpolished rice; triscuit or
shredded wheat biscuit; the prepared corn and wheat flakes; baked
potatoes; occasionally well cooked oatmeal or whole wheatmeal gruel.
Mushes are to be given seldom or never. Children seldom chew them well,
and they require thorough mastication. The rice is not to be sugared but
after the child has had enough, milk may be given. A small amount of
butter may be served with either rice or baked potato. The cereal foods
should be eaten dry. Let the children masticate them, as they should,
and as they will not if the starches are moistened with milk. When they
have had sufficient of these starches, and but one kind is to be served
at a meal, give milk, if milk is to be a part of the meal. To observe
the suggestions here given for the manner of feeding starches to
children may mean the difference between success and failure in raising
them. It is the little things that are important in the care of
children.</p>

<p id="id01474" class="calibre1">The acid fruits should not be given in the meals containing starchy
foods. Strong children who have plenty of opportunity to be in the fresh
air and who are very active can stand this combination, but it is
injurious to the nervous type. It is not a good thing to make such
combinations habitually for robust children. A good meal can be made of
fruit followed by milk. Do not slice the fruit, sprinkle it with sugar
and cover it with cream. Give the child the fruit and nothing else.
Neither oranges nor grapefruits are to be sugared. Their flavor is
better without. If the children want sweets, give them a meal of sweet
fruits.</p>

<p id="id01475" class="calibre1">When the child is eighteen months old it should have learned to
masticate well enough to eat various fruits. Apples, oranges,
grapefruits, berries, cherries, grapes and melons are among the foods
that may be given. If the child does not masticate well, either grind
the fruit or scrape it very fine. The sweet fruits require so much
mastication that only their juices should be fed until the child is old
enough to masticate thoroughly. Bananas should also be withheld until
there is no doubt about the mastication. They must be thoroughly ripe,
the skin being dark in spots and the flesh firm and sweet. A green
banana is very starchy, but a ripe one contains hardly any starch and
digests easily.</p>

<p id="id01476" class="calibre1">At first the meal is fruit, followed with milk. Buttermilk or clabbered
milk may be substituted for sweet milk. A little later, begin giving
cottage cheese occasionally in place of milk, if the child likes it.</p>

<p id="id01477" class="calibre1">The succulent vegetables may be given quite early. At the age of two
years stewed onions, green peas, cauliflower, egg plant and summer
squash may be given. Gradually increase the variety until all the
succulent vegetables are used. At first it may be necessary to mash
these vegetables.</p>

<p id="id01478" class="calibre1">The longer children go without meat the better, and if they never
acquired the meat-eating habit it would be a blessing. If the parents
believe in feeding their children meat, they should wait until the
little ones are at least four years old before beginning. Meats are
digestible enough, but too stimulating for young people. Chicken and
other fowls may be used at first, and it is best to use young birds.
Beef and pork should not be on the children's menu. At the age of seven
or eight the variety may be increased. However, parents who wish to do
the best by their children will give them little or no meat. Many of the
sorrows that parents suffer through their wayward children would be done
away with if the young people were fed on less stimulating foods.</p>

<p id="id01479" class="calibre1">Eggs are better for children than meat. However, it is not necessary to
give them. The children get enough milk to supply all the protein they
need. Eggs may be given earlier than meat. At the age of two and
one-half years an egg may be given occasionally. At three they may be
given every other day, one egg at a meal. At five or six years of age,
an egg may be given daily, but not more than one at a time. If they are
soft boiled, three and one-half minutes will suffice. If hard boiled,
cook them fifteen to twenty minutes. An egg boiled seven or eight
minutes is not only hard but tough. Longer boiling makes the albumin
mellow. Always prepare eggs simply without using grease.</p>

<p id="id01480" class="calibre1">Eggs may be given in combination with either fruits or vegetables. Milk
is not to be taken in the egg meal, for if such combinations are made
the child gets more protein than necessary. Eggs are easy to digest and
the chief objection to their free use in feeding children is that the
protein intake will be too great, which causes disease.</p>

<p id="id01481" class="calibre1">Nuts should not be given until the children are old enough to masticate
them thoroughly. The best combination is the same as for eggs. Children
under six years of age should not have much more than one-half of an
ounce of nut meats at a meal. The pecans are the best. Children rarely
chew nuts well enough, so they should seldom be used. They may be ground
very fine and made into nut butter, which may be substituted for
ordinary butter.</p>

<p id="id01482" class="calibre1">Give no butter until the child has completed his second year. The whole
milk contains all the fat necessary. Butter should always be used in
moderation, for although it digests easily, it is a very concentrated
food.</p>

<p id="id01483" class="calibre1">Again the question will be asked: "How much shall I feed my child?" I do
not know, but I do know that most children get at least three times as
much food as is good for them. People can establish a toleration to a
certain poison, and seemingly take it with impunity for a while. Some
arsenic eaters and morphine addicts take enough of their respective
drugs daily to kill a dozen normal men. However, the drugs, if not
stopped, always ruin the user in the end. It is the same way with food.
Children seem to establish a toleration for an excess for a shorter or
longer period of time, but the overeating always produces discomfort and
disease in the end, and if it is continued it will cause premature
death.</p>

<p id="id01484" class="calibre1">About one-third or one-fourth of what children eat is needed to nourish
them. The rest makes trouble. Read the chapters in this book on
overeating and on normal food intake. They give valuable pointers.
Parents know their children best, and the mother can, or should be able
to tell when there are signs of impending danger. If there is a decided
change in the child's disposition it generally denotes illness. Some
children become very sweet when they are about to be ill, but most of
them are so cranky that they make life miserable for the family. A foul,
feverish breath nearly always comes before the attack. A common danger
signal is a white line around the mouth. Another one is a white, pinched
appearance of the nose. A flushed face is quite common. The tongue never
looks normal. Except the abnormal tongue, these symptoms are not all
present before every attack, but one or more of them generally are. No
matter what the signs of trouble may be, stop all feeding immediately.
If this is done, the disease generally fails to develop, but if feeding
is continued there is sure to be illness. These symptoms indicate that
the digestion is seriously disturbed. It is folly to feed when there is
an acute attack of indigestion. Besides, it is very cruel, for it causes
much suffering.</p>

<p id="id01485" class="calibre1">Such symptoms in children are caused by improper eating, and overeating
is generally the chief fault. The remedy is very simple: Feed less.</p>

<p id="id01486" class="calibre1">A coated tongue indicates too much food. A clean tongue shows that the
digestive organs are working well. If the tongue is not smooth and a
pretty pink in color, it means that the child has had too much food and
the meals must be reduced in quantity until the tongue does become
normal, which may take a few months in chronic cases. Peculiar little
protruding spots when red and prominent on the tip and edges of the
tongue indicate irritation of the alimentary tract and call for
reduction of food intake.</p>

<p id="id01487" class="calibre1">The parents can soon learn how much to feed the children if they will be
guided by these hints. Poor health in the children indicates parental
failure, and this is one place where they can not afford to fail.
Parents must be honest with themselves and not put the blame where the
doctors put it—on bacteria, draughts, the weather, etc. Sometimes the
climate is very trying on the babies, but it never kills those who have
intelligent care.</p>

<p id="id01488" class="calibre1">If it is found that the child next door, of the same age, eats three or
four times as much as your child, do not become alarmed about your
little one, but give the neighbor's child a little silent sympathy
because its parents are ignorant enough to punish the little one so
cruelly.</p>

<p id="id01489" class="calibre1">For those who desire more definite hints regarding feeding of children,
an outline has been prepared for several days. This is very simple
feeding, but it is the kind of feeding that will make a rose bloom in
each cheek. The child will be happy and contented and bring joy to the
hearts of the parents.</p>

<p id="id01490" class="calibre1">Breakfast: Whole wheat toast, butter and a glass of milk.</p>

<p id="id01491" class="calibre1">Lunch: A baked apple and a dish of cottage cheese.</p>

<p id="id01492" class="calibre1">Supper: Steamed or boiled brown rice and milk.</p>

<p id="id01493" class="calibre2">Breakfast: Puffed wheat and milk.</p>

<p id="id01494" class="calibre1">Lunch: Oranges and milk.</p>

<p id="id01495" class="calibre1">Supper: An egg, parsnips and onions, both stewed.</p>

<p id="id01496" class="calibre2">Breakfast: Oatmeal or whole wheat porridge and milk.</p>

<p id="id01497" class="calibre1">Lunch: Berries and milk.</p>

<p id="id01498" class="calibre1">Supper: Baked potato, spinach and a plate of lettuce.</p>

<p id="id01499" class="calibre2">Breakfast: Shredded wheat biscuit and milk.</p>

<p id="id01500" class="calibre1">Lunch: Stewed prunes and milk or cottage cheese.</p>

<p id="id01501" class="calibre1">Supper: Whole wheat toast and milk.</p>

<p id="id01502" class="calibre2">These are merely hints. Where one juicy fruit is suggested, another may
be substituted. In place of the succulent vegetables named, others may
be used. Any of the starches may be selected in place of the ones given.
However, no mistake will be made in using the whole wheat products as
the starch mainstay.</p>

<p id="id01503" class="calibre1">Desserts should not be fed to children often. Rich cakes and all kinds
of pies should be omitted from the bill of fare. It is true that some
children can take care of them, but what is the use of taking chances? A
plain custard, lightly flavored, may be given with toast. If ice cream
is above suspicion a moderate dish of this with some form of starch may
be given, but milk is not to be taken in the same meal with either ice
cream or custard.</p>

<p id="id01504" class="calibre1">At the end of the third year it is time enough to begin to feed the
salad vegetables, though they may be given earlier to children who
masticate well. The dressing should be very plain, nothing more than a
little salt and olive oil, or some clabbered cream. No dressing is
necessary. The salad vegetables may be eaten with the meal containing
eggs and the stewed succulent vegetables.</p>

<p id="id01505" class="calibre1">At the age of about seven or eight the child may be put on the same diet
as the parents, provided they live simply. Otherwise, continue in the
old way a little longer. For the best results in raising children,
simplicity is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p id="id01506" class="calibre1">Children who are early put on a stimulating diet develop mental and
sexual precocity, both of which are detrimental to physical welfare. The
first desideratum is to give the children healthy bodies, and then there
will be no trouble in giving them what knowledge they need.</p>

<p id="id01507" class="calibre1">In overfed boys the sex urge is so strong that they acquire secret
habits, and sometimes commit overt acts. Too much protein is especially
to blame. These facts are not understood by many and the result is that
the parents fail in their duty to their children.</p>

<p id="id01508" class="calibre1">It is best not to bring young children to the table, if there is
anything on it that they should not have, for it nearly always results
in improper feeding. The children are curious and they beg for a little
of this and a little of that. Unthinkingly the parents give them little
tastes and bites and before the meal is over they have had from six to
twelve different kinds of food, some of them not fit for adult
consumption. If the child understands that it is not to ask for these
things and abides by this rule, it is all right, but such children are
rare. A child that fretfully begs for this and that at the table upsets
itself and the parents.</p>

<p id="id01509" class="calibre1">Make no sudden changes in the manner of feeding, unless the feeding is
decidedly wrong.</p>

<p id="id01510" class="calibre1">Active children get all the exercise they need. They should spend a
large part of the day in the open, and this is even more important for
the delicate ones. The bedroom should be well ventilated, but the
children must be kept cozy and warm or they do not sleep well.</p>

<p id="id01511" class="calibre1">After the child is old enough not to soil itself, one or two baths a
week are sufficient. There is no virtue in soaking. Swimming is
different, for here the child is active in the water and it does not
weaken him so. Swimming should be a part of every child's education.</p>

<p id="id01512" class="calibre1">Bed time should be early. The children should be tucked in and the light
turned off by 8 o'clock, and 7 o'clock is better for children under
five. If they want to get up early in the morning, let them, but put
them to bed early at night.</p>

<p id="id01513" class="calibre1">Infants should not be exposed long to the direct rays of the summer sun,
for it is liable to cause illness. It upsets the stomach and then there
is a feverish spell. If nothing is fed that will generally be all, but
it is unnecessary to make babies ill in this way. They should not be
chilled either.</p>

<p id="id01514" class="calibre1">Husband and wife do not agree at all times, but they make a mistake when
they disagree in the presence of their children. Young people are quick
to take advantage of such a state of affairs and they begin to play the
parents against each other. When a point comes up where there is a
difference of opinion, the decision of the parent who speaks first
should stand, at least for the time being. Then when they are by
themselves, man and wife can discuss the matter if it is not
satisfactory, and even quarrel about it, if that gives them pleasure.
Parents who do not control themselves can not long retain the full
respect of their children. Lost respect is not very far distant from
lost love.</p>

<p id="id01515" class="calibre1">People often object to a change in methods, for, they say, the new plan
will cause too much trouble. The plan here outlined causes less trouble
than the conventional method of caring for children. It is simpler and
gives better results. If it were followed out the mortality of children
under ten years of age in this country would be reduced from over
400,000 annually to less than 25,000. In spite of everything, a number
of young people will get into fatal pranks.</p>

<p id="id01516" class="calibre1">There are difficulties in the way of raising children properly, but a
healthy child is such a great reward that the efforts are paid for a
hundred times over. Nothing wears the parents out more quickly than a
child who is always fretting and crying, always on the brink of disease
or in its grasp. In raising children the best way is the easiest way.</p>

<h4 id="id01517" class="calibre14">THE CHILD'S MENTAL TRAINING.</h4>

<p id="id01518" class="calibre1">A healthy body is the child's first requirement. However, if the mental
training is poor, giving wrong views of life, a good physique is of but
little service.</p>

<p id="id01519" class="calibre1">It is quite generally agreed among observers that the first seven years
of life leave the mental impressions which guide the whole life, and
that after the age of fourteen the mental trend rarely changes. There
are a few individuals with strength enough to make themselves over
mentally after reaching adult life, but these are so few that they are
almost negligible, and even they are largely influenced by their youth
and infancy. It is as easy to form good mental habits as bad ones. It is
within the power of all parents to give their children healthy bodies
and healthy minds, and this is a duty, which should prove a pleasure.
The reason such heritage is so rare is that it requires considerable
self-control and most parents live chaotic lives.</p>

<p id="id01520" class="calibre1">Upon the mentality depends the success in life. "It is the mind that
makes the body rich." No matter how great an individual's success may
seem in the eyes of the public, if the person lacks the proper
perspective, the proper vision and the right understanding, his success
is an empty thing. Wealth and success are considered synonymous, but I
have found more misery in the homes of the rich than among the poor.
Physical wants can be supplied and the suffering is over, but mental
wants can only be satisfied through understanding, which should be
cultivated in childhood.</p>

<p id="id01521" class="calibre1">"All our problems go back to the child—corrupt politics, dishonesty and
greed in commerce, war, anarchism, drunkenness, incompetence and
criminality."—Moxom.</p>

<p id="id01522" class="calibre1">Given a healthy body and a good mind, every individual is able to become
a useful member of society, and that is all that can be expected of the
average individual. All can not be eminent, and it is not necessary.</p>

<p id="id01523" class="calibre1">Upon the child's mental impressions and the habits formed in infancy and
youth depend the mental workings and the habits of later life. Therefore
it is necessary to nurture the little people in the right kind of
atmosphere. If the child is trained properly from infancy there will be
no serious bad habits to overcome during later years,  and, as all know,
habits are the hardest of all bonds to break. To overcome the coffee and
alcohol habits is hard, but to overcome bad mental habits is even more
difficult.</p>

<p id="id01524" class="calibre1">First of all, let the infant alone most of the time. Some mothers are so
full of love and nonsense that they take their babies up to cuddle and
love them at short intervals, and then there are the admiring relatives
who like to flatter the parents by telling them that the baby is the
finest one they have seen; it is an exceptional baby. So the relatives
have to bother the infant and kiss it. This should not be. The child
should be kept in a quiet room and should not be disturbed. There are no
exceptional babies. They are all much alike, except that some are a
little healthier than others. If they are let alone, they have the best
opportunity to develop into exceptional men and women.</p>

<p id="id01525" class="calibre1">Paying too much attention to babies makes them cross and irritable. They
soon learn to like and then to demand attention. If they do not get it
at once they become ill-tempered and cry until attention is given. Thus
the foundation of bad temper is laid in the very cradle. They gain their
ends in infancy by crying. Later on they develop the whining habit. When
they grow older they fret and worry. Such dispositions are the faults of
the parents.</p>

<p id="id01526" class="calibre1">It does not take long for children to learn how to get their way, and if
they can do it by being disagreeable, you may be sure that they will
develop the worst side of their nature. Let the child understand that
being disagreeable buys nothing, and there will soon be an end of it.
Children who are well and well cared for are happy. They cause their
elders almost no trouble. To lavish an excessive amount of care on a
baby may be agreeable to the mother at first, but it is different when
it comes to caring for an ill-tempered, spoiled child of eight or nine
years.</p>

<p id="id01527" class="calibre1">Many crimes are committed in the name of love. Many babies are killed by
love. Unless love is tempered by understanding it is as lethal as
poison. Many parents think they are showing love when they indulge their
children, but instead they are putting them onto the road that leads to
physical and mental decay. True love is helpful, kind and patient. The
spurious kind is noisy, demonstrative and impatient.</p>

<p id="id01528" class="calibre1">Do what is necessary for children, but do not allow them to cause
unnecessary work. What they can do for themselves they should do. They
can be taught to be helpful very early. They should be taught to be neat
and tidy. They should learn to dress themselves and how to keep their
rooms and personal effects in good order early in life, no matter how
many servants there may be. These little things are reflected in their
later lives. They help to form the individual's character. It is what we
do that largely make us what we are, and every little act and every
thought has a little influence in shaping our lives. An orderly body
helps to make an orderly mind and vice versa.</p>

<p id="id01529" class="calibre1">Many of the rich children are unfortunate indeed. Some times poor
parents have so many children that each one gets scant attention, but
the children of many of the rich get no parental attention. The parents
are too busy accumulating or preserving a fortune and climbing a social
ladder to bother with their children. Their raising is delegated to
servants. At times the little ones are put on display for a few minutes
and then the parents are as proud of them as they are of the expensive
paintings that adorn the walls or the blooded dogs and horses in kennels
and stables. No amount of paid service can compensate for the lack of
parental love.</p>

<p id="id01530" class="calibre1">The ideal today, especially for female children, seems to be to make
ornaments of them, to train them to be useless. Girls, as well as boys,
should be taught to be useful. They should be taught that those who do
not labor are parasites. If some do not work, others have to work too
hard. The story is told of Mark Twain that he dined with an English
nobleman who boasted that he was an earl and did not labor. "In our
country," said Mark Twain, "we do not call people of your class earls;
we call them hoboes."</p>

<p id="id01531" class="calibre1">It does not matter how wealthy parents are, they should teach their
children how to earn a living, and they should instill into them the
ideal of service, for a life of idleness is a failure. The shirkers and
wasters are not happy. The greatest contentment in life comes from the
performance of good work. Ecstatic love and riotous pleasure can not
last. Work with love and pleasure is good. But love and pleasure without
work are corroding.</p>

<p id="id01532" class="calibre1">Children who are waited upon much become selfish. They soon become
grafters, expecting and taking everything and giving nothing. This is
immoral, for life is a matter of compensation, and consists in giving as
well as in taking. Children should be taught consideration for others,
and should not be allowed to order the servants around; not that it
harms the servants, but it has a bad effect on the children.</p>

<p id="id01533" class="calibre1">Because the child's period of development is so long, it is important to
have a proper adjustment in the home between parents and the children.
Lack of adjustment wears out the parents, especially the mother, and
gives false impressions to the young people. To prevent friction and get
good results, children should be taught obedience. Obedience is one of
the stepping stones to ability to command.</p>

<p id="id01534" class="calibre1">In those homes where the words of the parents are law there is but
little friction. Obedience should be taught from the very start. As soon
as the child realizes that the parents mean what they say and that it is
useless to fret and complain about a command, that is the end of the
matter. How different it is with disobedient children! The parents have
to tell them what to do several times and then the bidding often remains
undone.</p>

<p id="id01535" class="calibre1">Begin to teach obedience and promptness as soon as the children
understand, for it is more difficult later. The older the children the
harder it is. Children know so little and are so conceited that they do
not realize that because of lack of experience, observation and
reflection they can not safely guide themselves at all times. When they
are allowed to act so that they are a nuisance to others and harmful to
themselves, they do not give up this license with good grace. There are
times to be firm and then firmness should be used. It is necessary for
the parents to cooperate.</p>

<p id="id01536" class="calibre1">Various parents have different ways of correcting their children, and it
is not difficult to make them realize that obedience is a part of the
plan of early life. To illustrate: If the children are called for a
meal, they should come promptly. If there is a tendency to lag, tell
them that if they do not come when called they will get nothing to eat
until next mealtime, and act accordingly. This is no cruelty, for no one
is harmed by missing a meal. It generally proves very effective.</p>

<p id="id01537" class="calibre1">At the table, serve the children what your experience has told you they
can take with benefit, without saying anything about it. If they ask for
anything else, give it if you think proper. If not, say no. If they
start to beg and whine, tell them that such conduct will result in their
being sent away from the table, and if they still continue, do as you
have said, and let there be no weakening. This may cause a few very
disagreeable experiences at first, but it is much better to have a few
of them and be through, than to continue year after year to have such
trouble. Some children can eat everything with apparent impunity and
their parents usually pay no attention to what they eat. But there are
others who become ill if they are improperly fed. Children who are often
feverish and take all the diseases peculiar to the young, are
maltreated. They are not properly fed. Those who are prone to
convulsions must be fed with great care, or there is danger of their
becoming epileptics. Firmness in such cases generally means the
difference between health and disease or even death.</p>

<p id="id01538" class="calibre1">By all means be firm in such matters. Indulging the children to excess
is invariably harmful. When your children become ill and die, you can
truly say, "Behold my handiwork."</p>

<p id="id01539" class="calibre1">In the same way teach the children to do promptly whatever they are told
to do. If they are told to go to bed, it should be done without delay or
protest. All the little duties that fall to their lot should likewise be
accomplished promptly. However, the parents should be reasonable and
they should avoid bombarding their children with commands to do or not
to do a thousand and one things that do not matter at all. Let the
children alone except when it is really necessary to direct them.</p>

<p id="id01540" class="calibre1">Unfortunately, most of the parents are blind to their own faults, but
see very clearly those of others. The mistakes they make in their own
families open their eyes to those of others, and then they are often
very impatient. I know one gentleman who has excellent knowledge of the
proper training of the young, but as a parent he is a total failure. He
is so explosive and lacking in patience and firmness, perhaps also in
love, that his knowledge has not helped him. It is not what we know, but
what we apply, that makes or mars.</p>

<p id="id01541" class="calibre1">Obedience reduces friction and trains the children into habits of
efficiency. It is not only valuable in preserving the health of the
parents, but in increasing the child's earning capacity when the time
comes to labor in earnest.</p>

<p id="id01542" class="calibre1">Plato said that democracies are governed as well as they deserve to be.
Likewise, parents get as much obedience, respect, affection and love as
they deserve, and the three latter are largely dependent upon the
former. It would be difficult to overemphasize the importance of
obedience.</p>

<p id="id01543" class="calibre1">In nature we find that the animals teach their young how to live
independently as soon as they have the strength to care for themselves.
This is what parents should teach their children. This may cause the
mother pain, for many mothers like to keep their children helpless,
dependent and away from contact with the world as long as possible. Wise
mothers do not handicap their children thus. The best parents are those
who teach their children early how to make their own way.</p>

<p id="id01544" class="calibre1">Doubtless the greatest happiness is to be found in a congenial family,
where the parents understand and love each other and their children.
Those parents who are so busy that they lack the time to become
acquainted with their infants and keep up this intimacy, are losing a
part of life that neither money nor social position can give them. Many
wait until too late to get on intimate terms with their children. When
young, the children are naturally loving and then the beautiful ties
which neither time nor misfortune can sunder are formed. When the
children are grown it is too late to establish such a relation. Then
they look at their parents with as critical eyes as they use toward
other people, and though they may become very good friends, the tender
love is lacking. Love between man and woman is unstable, but the
beautiful love that springs from companionship of children and parents
lasts until the end.</p>

<p id="id01545" class="calibre1">While some mothers neglect their children, many become too absorbed in
them. The children become all of the mother's life. As the young people
become older, their horizon naturally widens. During infancy the parents
can fill the child's whole life, but soon other interests crave
attention. There is always a tragedy in store for the mother who refuses
to see that her children, as they grow older, will demand the human
experience necessary for individual growth and development. If the
mother has no other interest than her children she will one day be left
with a heart as empty as the home from which the children are gone.
There are so many interesting things in this world, and every mother
should have her hobby. She should have at least one hour each day sacred
to herself, in which she can relax and cultivate the mind. This will
help to fill the coming years, which too often prove barren. Loving
parents get all the reward they should expect from the beautiful
intimacy that exists between them and their growing children. So-called
ungrateful children have incompetent parents. Parents have no right to
demand gratitude. They do no more for their children than was done for
themselves in the morning of their lives. The right kind of parents
never want for rewards. They are repaid every day so long as they live.
Children grow under the care of their parents, but the parents also grow
and expand in understanding, sympathy and love through association with
their children.</p>

<p id="id01546" class="calibre1">Today society does not treat the mothers with the proper consideration.
The mothers deserve well, for they have to give many of their best years
to the children. These are the productive years, and generally unfit the
women to go into economic competition with the rest of the world
afterwards. Society owes it to the mothers of the race to see that they
are not made to suffer for fulfilling their destiny. Motherhood today is
as dangerous as the soldier's life, though it ought not to be, and it is
more difficult to raise children than to conduct a successful business.
However, the financial rewards for motherhood are generally nil. The
least society can do is to see that these women do not want for the
necessities of life.</p>

<p id="id01547" class="calibre1">Most children are interrogation points. This is well, for they learn
through curiosity. The questions should be answered honestly, or not at
all. It is common to give untrue answers. This is poor policy, for the
answers are a part of the child's education and untruths make the young
people ignorant and superstitious. It takes considerable patience to
raise a child and he who is unwilling to exercise a little patience has
no right to become a parent.</p>

<p id="id01548" class="calibre1">Whether to use corporeal punishment or not is a question that the
parents must decide for themselves. Many parents are in the habit of
nagging their children. It is, "Don't do this," and "Don't do that,"
until the little ones feel as exasperated as the Americans in Berlin,
where everything that one has an impulse to do is "Verboten." The
children have not yet acquired caution, nor are they able to think of
more than one or two things at a time. Consequently they forget what
they are not to do, and then parental wrath descends upon them. Parents
can well afford to be deaf and blind to many things that happen. Those
mothers who are ever shouting prohibitions soon cultivate a fretful,
irritable tone that is bad for all concerned, and which does not breed
respect and obedience. Make it a rule not to interfere with the children
except when it is necessary, and tell them to do but one thing at a
time.</p>

<p id="id01549" class="calibre1">If too many commands and prohibitions are issued, the children are prone
to forget them all. If they are talked to less, what is said is more
deeply impressed on their minds, and the chances are that they will
remember. Boisterousness is not badness, but indicates a state of
well-being, which results in bodily activity, including the use of the
vocal cords. It is common to all young animals, and the human animal is
the only one that is severely punished for manifesting happiness.</p>

<p id="id01550" class="calibre1">If the parents decide that corporeal punishment is necessary, they
should be sure that it has been deserved, for a child resents being
punished unjustly, and undeserved punishment is always harmful. Many
parents become so angry that they inflict physical punishment to relieve
their own feelings, and this is very wrong. If a parent calmly decides
that his child needs punishment, perhaps this is the case. The
punishment should be given calmly. Nothing can be more cowardly and
disgusting than the brutal assault of an angry parent upon a defenseless
child, and such parents always regret their actions if they have any
conscience, but they are generally of such poor moral fibre and so full
of false pride that they fail to apologize to the children for the
injustice done. These parents inflict suffering upon their children, but
they punish themselves most of all, for they kill filial regard and
love. Children have a very keen sense of fair play.</p>

<p id="id01551" class="calibre1">If it is decided to administer corporeal punishment, it should have
enough sting to it so that it will be remembered. Parents who temper
their justice with patience and love are not compelled to resort to
corporeal punishment often.</p>

<p id="id01552" class="calibre1">Children should never be hit on the head. Pulling or boxing the ears
should not be recognized as civilized warfare. Blows on the head may
partly destroy the hearings and affect the brain.</p>

<p id="id01553" class="calibre1">Another thing that may not come under the head of punishment in the
strictest sense, is lifting children by one of the arms. Women are prone
to do this. Often it partly dislocates the elbow joint. The children
whine and no one knows exactly what is the matter. If one arm is
occupied and the child has to be lifted from curb to street or over a
puddle, stoop and pass the unoccupied arm about the child's body and no
harm will be done.</p>

<p id="id01554" class="calibre1">No one should suggest to the child that it is bad. It is better to dwell
upon goodness. If a child is often told that it is bad, it will soon
begin to live up to its name and reputation, just as adults often do.</p>

<p id="id01555" class="calibre1">Many parents are in the habit of scaring their children. If the little
ones cry or disobey, they are told that the boogy-man is coming after
them, or they are threatened with being put out into the dark, or
perhaps some animal or bad person is coming to get them. Fear is
injurious to everybody, being ruinous to both the body and the mind, and
it is especially bad for growing children. The fear instilled in them
during childhood remains with some people to the end of life. It is not
uncommon to find people who dare not go out alone after dark because
they were scared in childhood. Children like exciting stories that would
naturally inspire fear, but it is not difficult for the reader or story
teller to inform the little ones that there are no big black bears or
bold robbers in the neighborhood, and that now there is nothing to fear
in the darkness.</p>

<p id="id01556" class="calibre1">Many teach the children to be ashamed of their bodies. Every part of the
body has its use and whatever is useful is good. Those who do not abuse
their bodies have nothing of which to be ashamed.</p>

<p id="id01557" class="calibre1">The education of children in the past has been along wrong lines. It has
been the aim to cram them full of isolated facts, many of them untrue.
We are slowly outgrowing this tendency, but too much remains. Thanks
largely to Froebel and Doctor Montessori, our methods are growing more
natural. The adult learns by doing and so does the child. Doctor
Montessori teaches the children to use all their senses. She gives them
fabrics of various textures and objects of different shapes and colors.
Thus they learn colors, forms, smoothness, roughness, etc. She teaches
them how to dress and undress and how to take their baths. She lets them
go about the schoolroom instead of compelling them to sit still at their
desks in cramped positions. In this way they get knowledge that they
never forget. They learn to read and write and figure in playful ways
through the proper direction of their curiosity. Little tots of four, or
even younger, are often able to read, and there has been no forcing. All
has come about through utilizing the child's curiosity.</p>

<p id="id01558" class="calibre1">If children are delicate, they should not be put into a schoolroom with
thirty or forty other children. Keep such children outdoors when the
weather permits and allow them to become strong. The education will take
care of itself later. There is nothing to be gained by overtaxing a
delicate child in the schoolroom, which too often is poorly ventilated,
and having a funeral a little later.</p>

<p id="id01559" class="calibre1">Children should be taught the few simple fundamental rules of nutrition
until they are second nature. A thorough knowledge of the fact that it
is very injurious to eat when there is bodily or mental discomfort is
worth ten thousand times as much to a child as the ability to extract
cube root or glibly recite, "Arma virumque cano Trojae," etc. The
realization that underchewing and overeating will cause mental and
physical degeneration is much more valuable than the ability to
demonstrate that a straight line is the shortest distance between two
points. This knowledge can be given so unobtrusively that the child does
not realize that it is learning, for there are many opportunities.</p>

<p id="id01560" class="calibre1">When a child gets sick and is old enough to understand, instead of
sympathizing with it explain how the illness came about, and please
remember that in explaining you can leave the germs out of the question,
for diseases of childhood are almost entirely due to improper feeding.
The value of education like that is beyond any price, for it is a form
of health insurance. Reforming the race, means that we must begin with
the children.</p>

<p id="id01561" class="calibre1">In parts of Europe cultured people have a working knowledge of two or
three languages. This is certainly convenient. Those who wish their
children to know one or two tongues beside English should remember that
in infancy two tongues are learned as readily as one, if they are
spoken. Those who can use three languages when they are four years old
are not infant prodigies. They have had the opportunity to learn, and
languages are simply absorbed. The language teaching in the public
schools is a joke. After taking several years of French or German the
school children can not speak about the common things of life in those
tongues, though they may know more about the grammar than the natives.
In other words, they know the science of the language, but not the
language itself.</p>

<p id="id01562" class="calibre1">A time comes when the child wants to know about the origin of life. If
the parents have been companions, they can impart this knowledge better
than anyone else. If they are unable to explain, the family doctor
should be able to impart the knowledge with delicacy. I do not believe
that such knowledge should be imparted to mixed classes in the public
schools, as advocated by some. If the parents do their duty, there will
be no need of public education in sex hygiene.</p>

<p id="id01563" class="calibre1">The doctor should be an educator, so he merits consideration here.
Nearly all families have their medical advisers, and these professional
people have it in their power to bring more sunshine into the homes than
their fees will pay for. On the other hand, they can, and too often do,
give both advice and remedies that are harmful They should sow seeds of
truth. If the infant is properly cared for, it is never ill. Inasmuch as
there are but few families with sufficient knowledge to keep their
babies healthy at all times, there are many calls for the doctor.
Parents are generally unduly alarmed about their infants. Nearly always
the trouble is primarily in the alimentary tract, due to improper
feeding, and the doctor with his wide experience can relieve the
parental anxiety, and at the same time tell them where they have made
their mistakes and how they have brought suffering upon their little
ones.</p>

<p id="id01564" class="calibre1">Of course, there should be no dosing with medicine and no injections of
foreign matter into the blood stream. Rest, quiet, cleanliness and
warmth are what the children need to restore them to health. The right
kind of physician when acting as adviser to intelligent parents who wish
to do the best by their children will see to it that there is little or
no disease.</p>

<p id="id01565" class="calibre1">If the parents do not know what to do, the most economical procedure is
to consult a physician who has understanding of and confidence in
nature. Pay no attention to the women of many words who give advice
"because they have had many children and have buried them all."</p>

<p id="id01566" class="calibre1">It is not as difficult to raise healthy children as sickly ones. It is
so simple that it takes many pages to explain it.</p>

<div class="calibre10"></div><div class="calibre10"></div><h2 id="id01567" class="calibre11">CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<h5 id="id01568" class="calibre5">DURATION OF LIFE.</h5>

<p id="id01569" class="calibre1">Old age today brings to mind a picture of decrepitude and decay. This is
because there is practically no natural old age. Those who live so that
they are unhealthy during the early years of life will not be well if
they reach advanced years. Old people can be well in body and sound in
mind. In order to attain this desirable end, it is necessary to live
properly during the first part of life. It is true that people may
dissipate and reform and then live long in comfort, but usually those
who spend too lavishly destroy their capital and go into physical or
mental bankruptcy.</p>

<p id="id01570" class="calibre1">There are many who during their prime say that they do not wish to grow
old. Their desire for a short life can easily be satisfied. All that is
necessary is to live in the conventional manner and the chance of dying
before reaching the age of fifty or sixty is good. A few live to be
seventy or more in spite of dissipation, but these are the exceptions.
They were endowed with excellent constitutions to begin with,
constitutions that were made to last over one hundred years. Where we
find one who has lived long in spite of intemperance, thousands have
died from it.</p>

<p id="id01571" class="calibre1">Most people desire to remain on earth long and they can have their wish.
They can advance in years healthy in body and with growing serenity of
mind. Physical and mental well-being are necessary to attain one's
life's expectancy. Old age should not be considered as apart from the
rest of life. It is but one of the natural phases. Those who do not live
to be old have failed to live completely.</p>

<p id="id01572" class="calibre1">Those who express their desire to die young generally change their mind
when they face death. Man clings to life.</p>

<p id="id01573" class="calibre1">Old age is a desirable condition. The physical tempests have been
subdued, if the life has been well spent. On the other hand, the faults
and foibles of the self-indulgent are accentuated and in such cases old
age is a misfortune.</p>

<p id="id01574" class="calibre1">No one knows what man's natural length of life is. Anatomists and
physiologists compare the human body with the bodies of various animals.
In this they are justified, for we all develop according to the same
laws. Most of the animals, when allowed to live as nature intended them
to live, reach an age of from five to six times the length of the period
of their growth. Human beings, with their ability to control their
environment, should be able to do even better than that. Man reaches
physical maturity between twenty and twenty-five years of age. This
would make his natural age one hundred and twenty-five to one hundred
and fifty years. There are cases on record that have lived longer and it
may be that if man would cease going in the way of self-destruction and
spend more thought and time on the welfare of the race, life would be
prolonged beyond even one hundred and fifty years. R. T. Trall, M. D.,
thought that man should live to be two hundred years old.</p>

<p id="id01575" class="calibre1">"What man has done man can do." If long life is worth while, doubtless a
time will come when long life will be enjoyed. The worry, fretting and
foolish haste of today will doubtless be partly done away with some
time. Then men and women will have time to live, instead of merely
existing, as most people do today. Men have lived long and found life
good. Long life for its own sake is perhaps not to be desired, but the
benefit that can be bestowed upon the race by those advanced in years is
desirable. Occasionally a brilliant individual appears on the scene,
doing superior work in life's morning, but most of the work that has
been found worthy of the consideration of the ages has been done by men
of mature years.</p>

<p id="id01576" class="calibre1">Galen, the famous physician, is said to have lived to a great age. It is
hard to tell exactly how old he was, but he was probably well past the
century mark at his death. His long life gave him time to do work that
is appreciated after the lapse of eighteen centuries. For many hundred
years after his death he dominated the practice of medicine and he is
today spoken of as often as any living medical man.</p>

<p id="id01577" class="calibre1">Thomas Parr, an Englishman, died at the age of one hundred and
fifty-two. He was hale and hearty to the very end. Unfortunately, his
reputation traveled far. He was brought to the English court, where he
was wined and dined, and as a consequence he died. Before this he had
always led the simple life. An autopsy was performed and the physicians
found his organs in excellent condition. The only reason they could give
for his death was his departure from the simple life which he had led in
his home.</p>

<p id="id01578" class="calibre1">Henry Jenkins, also an Englishman, lived to the age of one hundred and
sixty-nine years. He lived very frugally and was always on friendly
terms with nature. His favorite drink was water, though he partook in
moderation of "hop bitters." He was moderate in all things, and it is
said that he was never really ill until near the end of life. He was not
shriveled and shrunken, but a wholesome looking man. King Charles II.
sent a carriage to bring Mr. Jenkins to London, when he was one hundred
and sixty years old. The old gentleman declined to ride and walked the
two hundred miles to the metropolis. The king questioned him regarding
his life and desired to know the reason for his longevity. Mr. Jenkins
replied that he had always been sober and temperate and that this was
the reason for his many years. The Merry Monarch was neither sober nor
temperate, and you may be sure that this reply did not please him. Mr.
Jenkins was wiser than Mr. Parr had been, refusing to dissipate, even
though he was old. Consequently he returned to his home to enjoy life
nine years longer.</p>

<p id="id01579" class="calibre1">These two cases are authentic.</p>

<p id="id01580" class="calibre1">All are familiar with the records given in the Bible. Whether they are
figurative or not it is hard to tell. However, so many cases of
longevity are recorded that they in all probability have a basis in
fact. The Hebrews of old must have been a long-lived people. One hundred
and twenty years was not an extreme age. In Genesis is the record of
many over five hundred years old, and a few over nine hundred years of
age. At the time of the apostles the life span of the Hebrews had grown
shorter and hence the dictum of three score years and ten. Between the
time of Moses and that of the apostles the Hebrews had advanced—or
shall we say degenerated?—from a semi-barbarous people to one that had
the graces and also the vices of a higher civilization. The Hebrews of
old were husbandmen, who lived simply and got their vigor from the soil.</p>

<p id="id01581" class="calibre1">The cause of so much unnecessary suffering and of the premature deaths
has been discussed elsewhere in this book. In short, it is wrong living
and wrong thinking. Impure air and bad food kill no more surely than
does worry.</p>

<p id="id01582" class="calibre1">The bodies of children are composed largely of water. The structures are
flexible and elastic. The bones are made up mostly of cartilaginous
structure. As the children grow older more solids are deposited in the
body and the proportion of solid matter to water grows greater. Lime is
deposited in the bones. When they are limy throughout they are said to
be ossified. After this process is complete no more growth can take
place. Bone formation continues until about the age of twenty-five. At
this age the body is efficient. The fluids circulate without
obstruction. Could this condition be maintained, there would be no
decay.</p>

<p id="id01583" class="calibre1">During the early years of life the food intake in proportion to the
weight of the body is great. The child is active and uses much fuel to
produce power and to repair the waste. Considerable food is required for
body building. At this time a broken bone mends quickly and cuts heal in
a short time. With advancing years come slowness and sluggishness of the
various vital activities. The slowing up can be retarded almost
indefinitely by proper care of the body.</p>

<p id="id01584" class="calibre1">If the circulation could be maintained and the purity of the blood
stream guarded, old age would be warded off. A healthy body is able to
cleanse itself under favorable conditions and so long as the body is
clean through and through there is no opportunity for disease to take
place and there can be no aging. By aging I mean not so much the number
of years one has lived as the amount of hardening and degeneration of
the body that take place.</p>

<p id="id01585" class="calibre1">Some are as old at forty as others are at seventy.</p>

<p id="id01586" class="calibre1">When people have reached physical maturity they should begin to reduce
their food intake. There is no need for building material then. All that
is necessary is enough to repair the waste and to keep up the
temperature. The individual at twenty-seven should eat a little less
than when he was twenty and by the age of thirty-five he should have
reduced his food still more and made his meals very simple. Children
enjoy the gratification of the sense of taste, but at the age of
thirty-five a man has lived enough and experienced enough so that he
should know that the overgratification of appetites is an evanescent and
unprofitable pleasure, always costing more than it is worth. It is best
to grow into good habits while young, for it is difficult to do so after
one has grown old. The man who reforms after fifty is the exception.</p>

<p id="id01587" class="calibre1">Children are fond of cereal foods and sugars. They can eat these foods
two or three times a day and thrive. A man of thirty-five should make it
a general rule to limit his starch eating to once a day. Various
physiologists say that as much as sixteen ounces of dry starch
(equivalent to about thirty ounces of ordinary bread) are necessary each
day. This is entirely too much. Very few people can profitably eat more
than four ounces of dry starch a day, and for many this is too much.
Through eating as much as is popularly and professionally advocated,
early decay and death result.</p>

<p id="id01588" class="calibre1">The arteries are normally pliable and elastic. When too much food is
taken, the system is unable to cleanse itself. Debris is left at various
points. One of the favorite lodging places is in the coats of the
arteries. After considerable deposits have been formed the arteries lose
their elasticity. They become hard and unyielding. A normal radial
artery can easily be compressed with one finger. Sometimes the radial
artery becomes so hard that it is difficult to compress it with three
fingers. As the arteries grow harder they become more brittle and
sometimes they break, often a fatal accident.</p>

<p id="id01589" class="calibre1">This hardness of the arteries impedes the circulation, for the tone and
natural elasticity of the vessel walls is one of the aids to a normal
circulation.</p>

<p id="id01590" class="calibre1">So long as the arteries are normal all parts of the body are bathed in a
constantly changing stream of blood. The muscles, the nerves, the bones,
in fact all parts of the body, remove from the blood stream those
elements that are necessary for repairing or building the various
tissues. They also throw into the blood stream the refuse and waste due
to the constant repair and combustion going on all over the body. The
blood then leaves this refuse with the skin, lungs, kidneys and bowels,
which throw it out of the body.</p>

<p id="id01591" class="calibre1">So long as there are enough fuel and food, but not too much, and so long
as all the debris is carried away, there is health. But let this process
be thrown out of balance and there will be disease. The food intake is
seldom too small, though the digestion is frequently so poor that not
enough good food gets into the blood. Old age is largely due to
overeating and eating the wrong kinds of food. This is how overeating
causes premature aging, when it does not kill more quickly: When too
much food is taken, too much is absorbed into the blood, provided the
nutritive processes are active. Then all the food in the blood can not
be used for repair and fuel. The balance must either be excreted or
stored away in the body as deposits. If this storing takes place in the
joints, the result may be rheumatism or gout and at times even a
complete locking of the joints (anchylosis). If it is stored in the
walls of the blood-vessels they become hard and unyielding. No matter
where deposits take place, some of them will be found in the walls of
the blood-vessels. When these vessels grow hard they decrease in
caliber. The result is that the heart is compelled to work very hard,
but even then enough blood is not forced through the vessels. The
circulation becomes sluggish. The blood in the various parts becomes
stagnant.</p>

<p id="id01592" class="calibre1">Then insufficient good oxygen and first-class nourishment are brought to
the parts and not enough waste is carried away. Now the billions of
cells of which the body is composed are constantly bathed in poisonous
blood. The result is lowering of physical tone, or degeneration, of the
whole body. The hands and the feet suffer most at first from the poor
blood supply and become cold easily. Those who suffer constantly from
cold hands and feet should know that they are aging, although they may
be but twenty years old.</p>

<p id="id01593" class="calibre1">Such a condition as this often gives rise to varicose veins in the legs.
The feet are so far away from the heart, and it is such a long upgrade
return of the blood, that the circulation in the lower extremities
easily becomes sluggish. The flabby, relaxed tissues and the hardened
blood-vessels allow the blood to stagnate. This is why senile gangrene
is so common in the feet and so often fatal.</p>

<p id="id01594" class="calibre1">The brain gets a copious blood supply, yet the hardening of the arteries
often deprives this organ of its necessary nourishment. Then the higher
faculties begin to abdicate. If the hardening is extensive senile
softening of the brain may take place. This is always due to a lack of
pure blood. Sometimes the arteries are brittle enough to break. Baldness
is another symptom of physical decay. The hair follicles are not
properly nourished, for the arteries have become so contracted and the
tissues of the scalp so hardened that there is not enough blood to feed
the hair roots. Baldness begins on top of the head, generally the only
part affected, because it is farthest away from the blood supply.
Baldness is also partly due to man's headwear. Women are rarely bald.
There is a saying that there are no bald men in the poorhouse. Even if
this were true, it would not be very consoling, for the bald heads on
the street cleaning forces are numerous.</p>

<p id="id01595" class="calibre1">Overeating also causes premature aging because if results in
fermentation in the alimentary tract. The acids produced cause
degeneration of various tissues, having an especially bad effect on the
nervous system, which reflects the evil to other parts of the body.</p>

<p id="id01596" class="calibre1">It is well to bear in mind how this comes about: First there is
overeating; too much food improperly prepared is taken into the blood
stream; this makes the blood impure; deposits, causing hardening of the
tissues and reduction of the lumen of the vessels, are formed; the blood
grows more impure and the circulation sluggish; the tissues are
constantly bathed in impure blood, causing further degeneration. When a
certain point is reached nature can tolerate no more and life flits
away.</p>

<p id="id01597" class="calibre1">Those who wish to remain young must give some thought to the selection
of their food, especially if they are hearty eaters. If only sufficient
food is taken to keep the body well nourished it does not make much
difference what is eaten, provided it contains sufficient of fresh
foods, for when only enough food is taken to supply fuel and repairing
material, the food will all be used and none is left to ferment in the
digestive tract and form deposits in the body. The body will then keep
itself clean, or at least the formation of deposits takes place so
slowly that it is hardly perceptible. This can be compared with the
process taking place in the flues of a boiler. Stoke properly and they
remain clean. Choke the firebox with an excess of coal and the
combustion is so incomplete that the flues are soon filled up and the
grates are often burned out. Just so with the body: Feed too heavily and
the digestive organs are burned by the abnormal amount of acid produced
and the blood-vessels are filled with debris.</p>

<p id="id01598" class="calibre1">As most people lack the self-control to eat a normal amount of food,
they should select foods that are compatible and that are not too
concentrated. Too much meat causes degeneration of all parts of the body
and hardening. Too much starch causes acidity and hardening. The fruits
and the light vegetables have a tendency to overcome these degenerating
processes.</p>

<p id="id01599" class="calibre1">Starch is surely the chief offender in aging people. It is such a
concentrated food that overeating is easy, especially when it is taken
in the soft forms, such as mushes, fresh bread, griddle cakes and mashed
potatoes. If people would masticate their starchy foods thoroughly it
would greatly reduce the danger of overeating. It is common to eat bread
three times a day and in addition to take potatoes once or twice a day.
Those who consume so much starch carry into the system more food than
can be used and more of the mineral salts than can be excreted. The
result is the formation of deposits, chiefly of  lime carbonate and lime
phosphate; fatty deposits are also common.</p>

<p id="id01600" class="calibre1">In order to live long and comfortably it would be well to reduce the
starch intake to once a day. The meats also are objectionable when taken
in excess. To them can be attributed the chief blame for the formation
of gelatinous deposits in the body. However, they do not carry so much
earthy matter into the blood stream as do the starches. It is best to
partake of meat but once a day, or even more seldom. Meat should
certainly not be taken more than twice a day even by those who are
advanced in years. People who care enough for starch to take it three
times a day, or are compelled to live chiefly upon it, grow old and
homely more quickly than do those who are able to partake more
plentifully of the more expensive proteins. The flesh obtained from
young animals and birds is not so heavily charged with earthy matters as
is that which is obtained from old animals and birds.</p>

<p id="id01601" class="calibre1">Fruits and nuts do not carry so much earthy matter as do the starches
and meats. The sweet fruits could with profit partly take the place of
the starchy foods. The sugar they contain, which has the same nutritive
value as starches, needs very little preparation before entering the
blood stream. Thus a large part of the energy required for starch
digestion is saved. On the other hand, the use of too much refined sugar
is even worse than an excessive intake of starch. Nuts are not difficult
to digest if they are well masticated..</p>

<p id="id01602" class="calibre1">The objection to acid fruits during the latter years of life is that
they thin the blood and cause chilliness. This is true if they are
partaken of too liberally. It is not necessary to refrain from eating
acid fruits, but they should be taken in moderation and the mild ones
should be selected. Pears, mild apples and grapes are better than
oranges, grapefruits and apricots. Those who have learned moderation can
eat all the fruit desired, for they will not be harmed by what a normal
appetite craves.</p>

<p id="id01603" class="calibre1">Vegetables carry considerable earthy matter, but on account of their
helpfulness in keeping the blood sweet they should be eaten several
times a week.</p>

<p id="id01604" class="calibre1">Those who think that overeating of starch is too harshly condemned are
referred to the horse. When he is allowed to roam about and partake of
his natural food, grass, he stays well and lives to be forty or more
years old. When compelled to eat great quantities of corn and oats,
which are very rich in starch, the horse becomes listless and slow at an
early age. He is old at fifteen and before twenty he is generally dead.
When horses suffer from stiffness in the joints a few weeks spent in
pasture, where they have nothing but green grass and water, remove the
stiffness and make them younger. This shows what partaking of nature's
green salad does for them. Any good stock man will tell you that feeding
too much grain "burns a cow out." It does exactly the same for a human
being, burns him out and fills him with clinkers. Many people think that
it is a hardship to be moderate in eating and drinking, but it is not.
It brings such a feeling of well-being and comfort that it is
unbelievable to those who have not experienced it.</p>

<p id="id01605" class="calibre1">Many envy the rich, thinking that they can and do live riotously. Rich
men must live as simply as though they were poor or else they soon lose
the mental efficiency that brought them their fortunes, for when health
is gone mental power is reduced.</p>

<p id="id01606" class="calibre1">According to information in the Saturday Evening Post, the eating habits
of many of our most influential business men are very simple and the
amount of food partaken of small. John D. Rockefeller could hardly live
more simply and plainly than he does. William Rockefeller, George F.
Baker, James Stillman, Otto H. Kahn, Thomas Fortune Ryan, George W.
Perkins, J. Ogden Armour, John H. Patterson, Jacob H. Schiff and Andrew
Carnegie, all business giants with money enough to subsist on the most
expensive delicacies, are said to live more plainly than does the
average American who is complaining of the high cost of living. It is
the price they have had to pay for success and it is the price that you
and I will have to pay to live successfully, though our success may not
take the form of financial power.</p>

<p id="id01607" class="calibre1">The one conspicuous exception among the financially great to the rule of
simplicity was J. P. Morgan. His eating habits were somewhat gross, but
on account of his rugged constitution he lived to be more than
seventy-five years old. If he had given himself just a little more care
he would be alive today. They say that his strong black cigars did him
no apparent harm, but those who read of his last illness understandingly
cannot agree to that statement. Mr. Morgan started with enough vitality
to live and work far beyond the century mark. John D. Rockefeller was
not physically strong when young. He has been compelled to take good
care of himself and to be moderate. Now he is past seventy and enjoying
good health.</p>

<p id="id01608" class="calibre1">John W. Gates died a martyr to excess, partly excess of food. He lacked
balance. His son followed in his footsteps and died young.</p>

<p id="id01609" class="calibre1">Frank A. Vanderlip, who is looming large on the financial horizon takes
but two meals a day, from which he gets enough sustenance to do good
work and he says that this plan makes for efficiency. Perhaps now that
such men as Mr. Vanderlip live well on two meals a day, it is time to
cease calling those who live thus faddists. Eating three meals a day is
a habit and many can and do get along very well on two meals, and a few
take only one meal daily.</p>

<p id="id01610" class="calibre1">E. H. Harriman also lived simply. He illustrates the evil of a poorly
controlled mind. He died when but little past sixty, probably because
his frail body was too weak to harbor his great ambition. He took his
business wherever he went. When ill and business was forbidden by his
physician, Mr. Harriman had a telephone concealed in his bedroom and as
soon as the doctor was gone, he was on the wire.</p>

<p id="id01611" class="calibre1">Another cause of premature aging is the drinking of very hard water. The
earthy matter is absorbed into the blood stream with the water, and a
part of it is deposited in the various tissues. People beyond middle age
should drink water containing only a small portion of salts. Those who
partake of fresh fruits or fresh vegetables daily get all the salts that
the system needs. Even the young should not drink water that is
exceedingly hard. We can well illustrate the harm that comes from the
excessively hard water by referring to the disease known as cretinism.
This disease is quite prevalent in some parts of Europe. They say that
the disease is hereditary, which is questionable. What is inherited is
the environment and the habits of the parents. The chief cause is
without doubt the superabundance of earthy matter in the drinking water.
The cretins are ill-favored in face and figure. They do not reach normal
mental or physical maturity. They are old long before the normal person
has reached his prime. They die young, rarely living to be over thirty
years old. The bones are completely ossified early, which is the cause
of their small stature and their stupidity. The bones of the skull
harden so early that the brain has no room to expand.</p>

<p id="id01612" class="calibre1">There is no need of suffering, even in a mild degree, from the disease
of cretinism. If the water is very hard it is easy to distill what is
needed for drinking purposes. Such water should at least be boiled. It
is much better to have a teakettle lined with earthy matters than to
have such a lining in our arteries.</p>

<p id="id01613" class="calibre1">The excessive use of table salt is another cause of early aging. It is a
good preservative and pickles meat very well. People have long used salt
as a preservative and perhaps they got the salt-eating habit in this
way, first using it on the foods to be preserved, and then on nearly all
foods. Salts to excess, especially table salt, help to mummify or pickle
those who partake of them too liberally. The addition of sodium chloride
to foods is unnecessary. We get all we need of this salt in our fruits,
vegetables and cereals. Salt should be used in moderation.</p>

<p id="id01614" class="calibre1">Alcohol, tobacco and coffee are harmful. However, it will be found that
most of the old people have used one or more of these drugs for many
years and this is often largely responsible for their reaching old age.
Overeating causes more deaths than any other single factor. The use of
tobacco, coffee or alcohol has a tendency to reduce the desire for food
and thus these drugs at times prove to be conservers of individual
lives, though they are undoubted racial evils. They never can or will
take the place of self-control. The senses were given us to use for our
protection, but most people abuse them for temporary gratification, and
thus they go in the way of self-destruction.</p>

<p id="id01615" class="calibre1">Other things being equal, a healthy child will live longer than a weakly
one. But other things are not equal, so it often happens that a weakling
has as much chance to survive as a healthy person. Strong people
frequently squander their inheritance by the time they are forty or
fifty years old. Healthy people are very imprudent. They are well so
they think they will always remain well. What a surprise it is when
after thirty they discover that they cannot do with impunity what they
could do before with apparently no bad results! When warned about their
eating habits they boast that they can "eat tacks". Smoking and drinking
are harmless, they say! But the day of reckoning always comes and the
account is often so great that under the conventional treatment of today
they die.</p>
