    Nuts are as a rule not as completely digested as meats and animal fats,
and the principal reason is that they are eaten too rapidly and
masticated too little. Nuts properly masticated, taken in correct
combinations and amounts agree very well. It is not necessary, as many
believe, to salt them in order to prevent indigestion.</p>

<p id="id00525" class="calibre1">In the following pages will be found a number of diet tables, giving
compositions and fuel values of various foods which have been grouped
for the sake of convenience, for the foods in each group are quite
similar. These tables are not complete, for to list every food would
take too much space. I have simply selected a representative list from
the various classes of foods. Under flesh are given fish, meats and
eggs. Under succulent vegetables are given both root and top vegetables,
because of their similarity. Nuts, cereals, legumes, tubers and fruits
are each grouped because it is easy to gain an understanding of them in
this way. Milk is given a rather long chapter of its own because of its
great importance in the morning of life.</p>

<p id="id00526" class="calibre1">Allow me to repeat that it is impossible to figure out the calories in a
given amount of food and then give enough food to furnish so many
calories and thus obtain good results. I have already given the key to
the amount of food to eat, and it is the only kind of key that works
well. However, it is very helpful to have a knowledge of food values.</p>

<p id="id00527" class="calibre1">The calorie is the unit of heat, and heat is convertible into energy. A
calorie is the heat required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of
water one degree C. To translate into common terms, it is the heat
required to raise one pound of water four degrees F.</p>

<p id="id00528" class="calibre1">  One pound of protein produces 1,860 calories.<br class="calibre12"/>

  One pound of sugar produces 1,860 calories.<br class="calibre12"/>

  One pound of starch produces 1,860 calories.<br class="calibre12"/>

  One pound of oil or fat produces 4,220 calories.<br class="calibre12"/>
</p>

<p id="id00529" class="calibre1">For the scientific facts regarding foods I have consulted various works,
especially the following: Diet and Dietetics, by Gauthier; Foods, by
Tibbles; Food Inspection and Analyses, by Leach; Foods and their
Adulteration, by Wiley; Commercial Organic Analysis, by Allan. However,
I am most indebted to the numerous bulletins issued by the U. S.
Department of Agriculture. All who make a study of foods and their value
owe a great debt to W. O. Atwater and Chas. D. Wood, who have worked so
long and faithfully to increase our knowledge regarding foods.</p>

<p id="id00530" class="calibre1">As we consider the various groups of foods, directions are given for the
best way of cooking, but no fancy cooking is considered. Those who wish
fancy, indigestible dishes should consult the popular cook books.</p>

<p id="id00531" class="calibre1">The women have it in their power to raise the health standard fifty to
one hundred per cent by cooking for health instead of catering to
spoiled palates, and by learning to combine foods more sensibly than
they have in the past. The art of cooking has made its appeal almost
entirely to the palate. This art is not on as high level as the science
of cooking, which gives foods that build healthy bodies. The right way
of cooking is simpler, quicker and easier than the conventional method,
and gives food that is superior in flavor. After the normal taste has
been ruined, it takes a few months to acquire a natural taste again so
that good foods will be enjoyed.</p>

<p id="id00535" class="calibre1">The food value of meat depends on the amount of fat and protein it
contains. Lean meat may contain less than four hundred calories per
pound, while very fat meat may contain more than one thousand five
hundred calories.</p>

<p id="id00536" class="calibre1">These foods are eaten because they are rich in protein. Protein is the
great builder and repairer of the body. It forms the framework for both
bone and muscle. We can get along very well without starch or sugar or
fat, but it is absolutely necessary to have proteid foods. They are the
only ones that contain nitrogen, which is essential to animal life.</p>

<p id="id00537" class="calibre1">Nitrogenous foods are used not only to build and repair, but in the end
they are burned, supplying as much heat as the same weight of sugar or
starch.</p>

<p id="id00538" class="calibre1">Proteid foods are generally taken to excess. To most people they are
very palatable, and they are generally prepared in a manner that renders
rapid eating easy. Besides, meats contain flavoring and stimulating
principles, called extractives, which increase the desire for them. The
consequence is that those who eat meat often have a tendency to eat too
much. Excessive meat eating often leads to consumption of large
quantities of liquor. Stimulants crave company.</p>

<p id="id00539" class="calibre1">As will be noted, most fish and meat contain about 20 per cent. of
protein, while about 75 per cent. is water. The fatter the meat, the
less water it contains, and the more fuel value it has. The leaner the
meat, the more watery the animal, and the more easily is the flesh
digested. Beef is fatter than veal and harder to digest. Also, the flesh
of old animals is more highly flavored than that of the young ones,
because it contains more salts. For this reason people who have a
tendency to the formation of foreign deposits, as is the case with those
who have rheumatism and gout or hardening of the arteries, should take
the flesh of young animals when it is obtainable.</p>

<p id="id00540" class="calibre1">In the past we have been taught to partake of excessive amounts of
protein. The prescribed amount for the average adult has been about five
ounces. If we were to obtain all the protein from meat, this would
necessitate eating about twenty-five ounces of meat daily. However,
inasmuch as there is considerable protein in the cereals and milk, and a
little in most fruits and vegetables, a pound of meat would probably
suffice under the old plan. A few physicians have known that such an
intake of protein is excessive, and now the physiologists are learning
the same. It has lately been determined experimentally that the body
needs only about an ounce of protein daily, which will be supplied by
about five ounces of flesh. Three or four ounces of flesh daily make a
liberal allowance, for it is supplemented by protein in other foods.</p>

<p id="id00541" class="calibre1">Workers eat large quantities of flesh because they think they need a
great deal. The fact is that very little more protein is needed by those
who do hard physical labor than by brain workers. The extra energy
needed calls for more carbohydrates, not for protein.</p>

<p id="id00542" class="calibre1">When the organism is supplied with sugar, starch and fat, or one of
these, the protein of the body is saved, only a very small amount being
used to replace the waste through wear and tear. Though protein can be
burned in the body, it is not an economical fuel, either from a
physiological or financial standpoint. The energy obtained from flesh
costs much more than the same amount of energy obtained from
carbonaceous foods. Ten acres of ground well cultivated can raise enough
cereals and vegetables to support a number of people, but if this amount
of land is used for raising animals, it will support but a few. The
protein obtained from peas, beans and lentils is cheap, but these foods
do not appeal to the popular palate as much as flesh.</p>

<p id="id00543" class="calibre1">Meat immediately after being killed is soft. After a while it goes into
a state of rigidity known as rigor mortis. Then it begins to soften
again. This third stage is really a form of decay, called ripening. It
is believed that the lactic acid formed is one of the principal agents
producing this softening. Some people enjoy their meats, especially that
of fowls and game, ripe enough to deserve the name of rotten. The
ripening produces many chemical changes in the meat, which give the
flesh more flavor. Consequently those who indulge are very apt to
overeat. It is a fact that those who eat much flesh go into degeneration
more quickly than those who are moderate flesh eaters and depend largely
on the vegetable kingdom for food.</p>

<p id="id00544" class="calibre1">If an excess of good meat causes degeneration, there is no reason to
doubt that partaking of overripe foods is even worse.</p>

<p id="id00545" class="calibre1">All meat contains waste. If the flesh comes from healthy animals and is
eaten in moderation this waste is so small that it will cause no
inconvenience, for a healthy body is able to take care of it. If too
much is eaten, the results are serious. Overeating of flesh is followed
by excessive production of urea and uric acid products. Some of these
may be deposited in various parts of the body, while the urea is mostly
excreted by the kidneys. The kidneys do not thrive under overwork any
more than other organs. The vast majority of cases of diabetes and
Bright's disease are caused by overworking the digestive organs. Too
much food is absorbed into the blood and the excretory organs have to
work overtime to get rid of the excess.</p>

<p id="id00546" class="calibre1">Meats are easily spoiled. They should be kept in a cold place and not
very long. Fresh meat and fish are more easily digested than those which
are salted, or preserved in any other way. Pickled meats should be used
rarely The same is true of fish.</p>

<p id="id00547" class="calibre1">Ptomaines, or animal poisons, form easily in flesh foods. These are very
dangerous, and it is not safe to eat tainted flesh, even after it is
cooked. Fish decomposes quickly and fish poisoning is probably even more
severe than meat poisoning. Fish should be killed immediately after it
is caught, for experiments have shown that the flesh of fish kept
captive after the manner of fishers degenerates very rapidly. Fish
should be eaten while fresh. Even when the best precautions have been
taken, it is somewhat risky to partake of fish that has been shipped
from afar.</p>

<p id="id00548" class="calibre1">Flesh foods are more easily and completely digested than the protein
derived from the vegetable kingdom.</p>

<p id="id00549" class="calibre1">From the table it will be noted that some fish is fat and some is lean.
The ones containing more than 5 per cent of fat should be considered fat
fish. These are somewhat harder to digest than the lean ones, but they
are more nutritious.</p>

<p id="id00550" class="calibre1">Shell fish is generally low in food value and if taken as nourishment is
very expensive. However, most people eat this food for its flavor.</p>

<h4 id="id00551" class="calibre14">COOKING.</h4>

<p id="id00552" class="calibre1">Cooking is an art that should be learned according to correct
principles. Every physician should be a good cook. He should be able to
go into the kitchen and show the housewife how to prepare foods
properly. Medical men who are well versed in food preparation and able
to make good food prescriptions have no need of drugs.</p>

<p id="id00553" class="calibre1">The flesh of animals is composed of fibres. These fibres are surrounded
by connective tissue which is tough. The cooking softens and breaks down
these tissues, thus rendering it easier for the digestive juices to
penetrate and dissolve them. That is, proper cooking does this. Poor
cooking generally renders the meats indigestible.</p>

<p id="id00554" class="calibre1">The simpler the cooking, the more digestible will be the food. Flavors
are developed in the process, but these are hidden if the meats are
highly seasoned.</p>

<p id="id00555" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Boiling</i>: When meats are boiled they lose muscle sugar, flavoring
extracts, organic acids, gelatin, mineral matters and soluble albumin.
That is, they lose both flavor and nourishment. Therefore the liquid in
which they are cooked should be used.</p>

<p id="id00556" class="calibre1">The proper way to boil meat is to plunge it into plain boiling water.
Allow the water to boil hard for ten or fifteen minutes. This coagulates
the outer part of the piece of meat. Then lower the temperature of the
water to about 180 degrees F. and cook until it suits the taste. If it
is allowed to boil at a high temperature a long time, it becomes tough,
for the albumin will coagulate throughout.</p>

<p id="id00557" class="calibre1">Salt extracts the water from meat. Therefore none of it should be used
in boiling. The meat should be cooked in plain water with no addition.
No vegetables and no cereals are to be added. All meats contain some
fat, and this comes into the water and acts upon the vegetables and
starches, making them indigestible. Season the meat after it is cooked,
or better still, let everyone season it to suit the taste after serving.</p>

<p id="id00558" class="calibre1">Meats that are to be boiled should never be soaked, for the cold water
dissolves out some of the salts and some of the flavoring extracts, as
well as a part of the nutritive substances. It is better to simply wash
the meat if it does not look fresh and clean enough to appeal to the
eye, which it always should be.</p>

<p id="id00559" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Stewing</i>: If meat is to be stewed, cut into small pieces and stew or
simmer at a temperature of about 180 degrees F. until it is tender. It
is to be stewed in plain water. If a meat and vegetable stew is desired,
stew the vegetables in one dish, and the meat in another. When both are
done, mix. By cooking thus a stew is made that will not "repeat" if it
is properly eaten. Foods should taste while being eaten, not afterwards.</p>

<p id="id00560" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Broths</i>: If a broth is desired, select lean meat. Either grind it or
chop it up fine. There is no objection to soaking the meat in cold
water, provided this water is used in making the broth. Use no
seasoning. Let it stew or simmer at about 180 degrees F. until the
strength of the meat is largely in the water.</p>

<p id="id00561" class="calibre1">When the broth is done, set it aside to cool. Then skim off all the fat
and warm it up and use. One pound of lean meat will produce a quart of
quite strong broth.</p>

<p id="id00562" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Broiling</i>: Cut the meat into desired thickness. Place near intense
fire, turning occasionally, until done. Be careful not to burn the
flesh. An ordinary steak should be broiled in about ten minutes. Of
course, the time depends on the thickness of the cut and whether it is
desired rare, medium or well done, and in this let the individual suit
himself, for he will digest the meat best the way he enjoys it most.</p>

<p id="id00563" class="calibre1">Beefsteak smothered in onions is a favorite dish. It is not a good way
to prepare either the onions or the steak. A better way is to broil both
the steak and the onions, or broil the steak, cut the onions in slices
about one-half to three-fourths of an inch thick, add a little water and
bake them. Beefsteak and onions prepared in this way are both palatable
and easy to digest.</p>

<p id="id00564" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Roasting</i> is just like broiling, that is, cooking a piece of meat
before an open fire. Here we use a larger piece of meat and it therefore
takes longer. Of old roasting was quite common, but now we seldom roast
meat in this country.</p>

<p id="id00565" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Baking</i>: Here we place the meat in an enclosed oven. Most of our
so-called roast meats are baked. The oven for the first ten or fifteen
minutes should be very hot, about 400 degrees F. This heat seals the
outside of the meat up quite well. Then let the heat be reduced to about
260 degrees F. If it is kept at a high temperature it will produce a
tough piece of meat. The time the meat should be in the oven depends
upon the size of the piece of meat and how well done it is desired.</p>

<p id="id00566" class="calibre1">While baking, some of the juices and a part of the fat escape. About
every fifteen minutes, baste the meat with its own juice. A few minutes
before the meat is to be removed from the oven it may be sprinkled with
a small amount of salt, and so may broiled and roasted meats a little
while before they are done. However, many prefer to season their own
foods or eat them without seasoning and they should be allowed to do so.</p>

<p id="id00567" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Steaming</i>: This is an excellent way of cooking. None of the food value
is lost. Put the meat in the steamer and allow it to remain until done.
The cheapest and toughest cuts of meat, which are fully as good as the
more expensive ones and often better flavored, can be rendered very
tender by steaming. Tough birds can be treated in the same way. An
excellent way to cook an old hen or an old turkey is to steam until
tender and then put into a hot oven for a few minutes to brown. Some
birds are so tough that they can not be made eatable by either boiling
or baking, but steaming makes them tender.</p>

<p id="id00568" class="calibre1">It is best to avoid starchy dressings, in fact dressings of all kinds. A
well cooked bird needs none, and dressing does not save a poorly cooked
one. Most dressings are very difficult to digest.</p>

<p id="id00569" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Fireless cooking</i>: Every household should have either a good steamer or
a fireless cooker. Both are savers of time and fuel and food. They
emancipate the women. Those who have fireless cookers and plan their
meals properly do not need to spend much time in the kitchen.</p>

<p id="id00570" class="calibre1">Place the meat in the fireless cooker, following the directions which
accompany it. However, if they tell you to season the meat, omit this
part.</p>

<p id="id00571" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Smothering</i> is a modification of baking. Any kind of meat may be
smothered, but it is especially fine for chickens. Take a young bird,
separate it into joints, place into a pan, add a pint of boiling water.
If chicken is lean put in a little butter, but if fat use no butter.
Cover the pan tightly and place in oven and let it bake. A chicken
weighing two and one-half pounds when dressed will require baking for
one hour and fifteen minutes. Keep the cover on the baking pan until the
chicken is done, not raising it even once. Gravy will be found in the
pan.</p>

<p id="id00572" class="calibre1">Pressed chicken is very good. Get a hen about a year old. Place it into
steamer or fireless cooker until so tender that the flesh readily falls
from the bones. Remove the bones, but keep the skin with the meat. Chop
it up. Place in dish or jar, salting very lightly. Over the chopped-up
meat place a plate and on this a weight, and allow it to press over
night. Then it is ready to slice and serve. This is very convenient for
outings.</p>

<p id="id00573" class="calibre1">Fish should preferably be baked or broiled. It may also be boiled, but
it boils to pieces rather easily and loses a part of its food value. It
must be handled with great care. No seasoning is to be used. When served
a little salt and drawn butter or oil may be added as dressing.</p>

<p id="id00574" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Frying</i> is an objectionable method of cooking. It is generally held,
and with good reason, that when grease at a high temperature is forced
into flesh, it becomes very indigestible. In fact the crust formed on
the outside of the flesh can not be digested. It is folly to prepare
food so that it proves injurious.</p>

<p id="id00575" class="calibre1">However, there is a way of using the frying pan so that practically no
harm is done. Grease the pan very lightly, just enough to prevent the
flesh from sticking. Make the pan very hot and place the meat in it.
Turn the meat frequently. Fries (young chickens) may be cooked in this
way with good results. The same is true of steaks and chops.</p>

<p id="id00576" class="calibre1">Avoid greasy cooking. It is an abomination that helps to kill thousands
of people annually.</p>

<p id="id00577" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Paper bag cooking</i> is all right if it is convenient. Those who have
good steamers or fireless cookers will not find it of special advantage.</p>

<p id="id00578" class="calibre1">Brown flour gravies are not fit to eat. If there is any gravy serve it
as it comes from the pan without mixing it with flour or other starches.
It may be put over the meat or used as dressing for the vegetables. Milk
gravies are also to be avoided. Use only the natural gravies.</p>

<p id="id00579" class="calibre1">Oysters may be eaten raw or stewed. Stew the oysters in a little water.
Heat the milk and mix. Eat with cooked succulent vegetables and with raw
salad vegetables. It is best to leave the crackers out. The oysters
themselves contain very little nourishment, but when made into a milk
stew the result is very nutritious.</p>

<p id="id00580" class="calibre1">Eggs should be fresh. Some bakers buy spoiled eggs and use them for
their fancy cakes and cookies. This is a very objectionable practice and
may be one of the reasons that bakers' cookies never taste like those
"mother used to make." Eggs take the place of fish, meat or nuts, for
they are rich in protein. They may be taken raw, rare or well done.</p>

<p id="id00581" class="calibre1">Eggs may be boiled, poached, steamed or baked. Soft boiled eggs require
about three and one-half minutes. Hard boiled ones require from fifteen
to twenty minutes. The albumin of an egg boiled six or seven minutes is
tough. When boiled longer it becomes mellow. Eggs may be made into
omelettes or scrambled, but the pan should be lightly greased and quite
hot so that the cooking will be quickly done. Eggs are variously treated
for an omelette. Some cooks add nothing but water and this makes a
delicate dish. Others use milk, cream or butter, and beat.</p>

<p id="id00582" class="calibre1">Bacon is a relish and may be taken occasionally with any other food. It
should be well done, fried or broiled until quite crisp. This is one
place where frying is not objectionable.</p>

<p id="id00583" class="calibre1">Pork should rarely be used. It is too fat and rich and requires too long
to digest. When eaten it should be taken in the simplest of
combinations, such as pork and succulent vegetables or juicy fruits,
either cooked or raw, and nothing else.</p>

<p id="id00584" class="calibre1">Flesh may be eaten more freely in winter than in summer. Meat especially
should be eaten very sparingly during hot weather, for it is too
stimulating and heating. Nuts, eggs and fish are then better forms in
which to take protein.</p>

<h4 id="id00585" class="calibre14">COMBINATIONS.</h4>

<p id="id00586" class="calibre1">Flesh foods combine best with the succulent vegetables and the salad
vegetables or with juicy fruits. It is more usual to take vegetables
with flesh than to take fruit, but those who prefer fruit may take it
with equally as good results. Both fruits and vegetables are rich in
tissue salts, in which flesh foods are rather deficient. The succulent
vegetables contain some starch and the juicy fruits some sugar, but not
enough to do any harm. They both act as fillers.</p>

<p id="id00587" class="calibre1">Flesh is quite concentrated and it is customary to take it with other
concentrated foods, such as bread and potatoes. As a result too much
food is ingested. It would be a splendid rule to make to avoid bread and
potatoes when flesh food is taken, but if this seems too rigid, make it
a rule never to eat all three at the same meal. It is best to eat the
flesh foods without bread or potatoes, but if starch is desired, take
only one kind at a time.</p>

<p id="id00588" class="calibre1">Most people crave a certain amount of food as filler, and they have
fallen into the habit of using bread and potatoes for this purpose. This
is a mistake. Use the juicy fruits and the succulent vegetables for
filling purposes and thus get sufficient salts and avoid the many ills
that come from eating great quantities of concentrated foods.</p>

<p id="id00589" class="calibre1">When possible, have a raw salad vegetable or two with the meat or fish
meal.</p>

<p id="id00590" class="calibre1">Eat only one concentrated albuminous food at a meal. If you have meat,
take no fish, eggs, nuts or cheese.</p>

<p id="id00594" class="calibre1">Nuts vary a great deal in composition. They are generally the seeds of
trees, enclosed in shells, but other substances are also called nuts.
The representative nuts are rich in fat and protein, containing some
carbohydrate (sugar or starch.)</p>

<p id="id00595" class="calibre1">A few nuts, such as the acorn, cocoanut and chestnut, are very rich in
starch, and these should be classified as starchy foods. Very few foods
contain as high per cent of starch as the dry chestnut. In southern
Europe chestnuts are made into flour, and this is made into bread or
cakes. An inferior bread is also made of acorn flour. Chestnuts may be
boiled or roasted. They are very nutritious.</p>

<p id="id00596" class="calibre1">The more representative nuts are pecans, filberts, Brazil nuts and
walnuts. These may be used in place of flesh foods, for they furnish
both protein and fats. If the kernel is surrounded by a tough membrane,
as is the case in walnuts and almonds, it should be blanched, which
consists in putting the kernel in very hot water for a little while and
then removing this membrane. The pecan, though it does not contain very
much protein, is one of the best nuts, one which can be eaten often
without producing dislike.</p>

<p id="id00597" class="calibre1">Nuts have the reputation of being hard to digest. If they are not well
masticated they are very hard to digest indeed, but when they are well
masticated they digest almost as completely as do flesh foods and they
produce no digestive troubles.</p>

<p id="id00598" class="calibre1">One reason that nuts have obtained a bad reputation is that they are
often eaten at the end of a heavy meal, when perhaps two or three times
too much food has already been ingested. The result is indigestion and
the sufferer swears off on nuts. If he had sense enough to reduce his
intake of bread, potatoes, meat, pudding and coffee, the benefit would
be very great. The tendency is for the sufferer from indigestion to pick
out a certain food and blame all the trouble on that, when in truth the
combinations and the quantity of food are to blame.</p>

<p id="id00599" class="calibre1">Some vegetarians make nuts one of their principal foods. We can easily
get along without flesh, for we can obtain all the protein needed from
milk, eggs, nuts and legumes. However, people who are used to flesh are
able to digest it when they can take hardly anything else. The foods
which we prefer are taken largely because we have become accustomed to
them and have formed a liking for them, not because they are the very
best from which to select.</p>

<h4 id="id00600" class="calibre14">COOKING.</h4>

<p id="id00601" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Nut butter</i>: Take the nut meats, clean away all the skins and grind
fine in a nut mill. Then form into a pasty substance with or without the
addition of oil or water, to suit the individual taste. Most nut butters
are very agreeable in flavor. Sometimes the nuts are roasted and
sometimes they are not. Almond butter is very good. The nut butters soon
spoil if left exposed to the air, for the oils they contain turn rancid.</p>

<p id="id00602" class="calibre1">Peanut butter can be made by taking clean kernels of freshly roasted
peanuts and grinding fine. Some are very fond of this butter. Cocoanut
and cocoa butters are not made in this way. They are purified fats, the
former from cocoanuts, the latter from the cocoa bean.</p>

<p id="id00603" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Nut milk</i>: Take nut butter and mix with water until it is of the
desired consistency. Cocoanuts contain a sweet liquid which is called
cocoanut milk. However, the artificial cocoanut milk is made by pouring
a pint of boiling water over the flesh of a freshly grated cocoanut. Let
it stand until cold and strain. If it is allowed to stand some hours the
fat will rise to the top and form cream. This milk is used by some who
object to the use of animal products.</p>

<p id="id00604" class="calibre1">Various meals are made from nuts and made into food for the sick. This
does no harm, nor does it do any special good. These meals contain more
or less starch and the action of starches is much the same, no matter
what the source. Please remember that there are no health foods.</p>

<h4 id="id00605" class="calibre14">COMBINATIONS.</h4>

<p id="id00606" class="calibre1">Nuts are especially fine in combination with fruits. Fresh pecan meats
and mild apples make a meal fit for the gods. Nuts may be used in any
combination in which flesh is used, that is, they take the place of
flesh foods. The starchy nuts take the place of starchy foods.</p>

<p id="id00607" class="calibre1">A good meal is made of a fruit salad, consisting of two or three kinds
of fresh fruits and nuts.</p>

<p id="id00608" class="calibre1">Nuts or nut butter with toast also make a good meal.</p>

<p id="id00609" class="calibre1">Nuts have such fine flavor that cooks should think twice before spoiling
them. It is very difficult to use them in cookery and get a product that
is as finely flavored as the original nuts. The vegetarians use them in
compounding what they call roasts, cutlets, steaks, etc. My experience
with these imitation products has not been of the best, for though my
digestive organs are strong, they do not take kindly to these mixtures.
Some of my friends report the same results, in spite of thorough
mastication and moderation. These imitation roasts and cutlets usually
contain much starch and there is no reason to believe that it is better
to cook nut oils into starchy foods than it is to use any other form of
fat for this purpose. Those who like starch and nuts can make a splendid
meal of nut meats and whole wheat biscuits or zwieback.</p>

<p id="id00610" class="calibre1">In eating nuts, always remember that the mastication must be thorough.
It takes grinding to break up the solid nut meats and the stomach and
bowels have no teeth. Those who can not chew well should use the nuts in
the form of butter.</p>

<p id="id00611" class="calibre1">Ordinarily two ounces of nut meats, or less, are sufficient for a meal.</p>

<p id="id00612" class="calibre1">At present prices, nuts are not expensive, as compared with meat. Meat
is mostly water. Lean meat produces from five to seven hundred calories
to the pound. Nut meats produce from twenty-seven to thirty-three
hundred calories per pound. In other words, a pound of nut meats has the
same fuel value as about five pounds of lean meat, but not as great
protein value.</p>

<p id="id00613" class="calibre1">Those who are not used to nuts have a tendency to overeat, but this is
largely overcome as soon as people become accustomed to them.</p>

</p>

<p id="id00619" class="calibre1">Analyses of all foods are approximate. The food value varies with the
conditions under which the foods are grown and is not always even
approximately the same.</p>

<p id="id00620" class="calibre1">The fresh young legumes may be classed with the succulent vegetables.
The matured, dried legumes are to be classed both as starchy and proteid
foods. They are very easily raised and consequently cheap. They are the
cheapest source of protein that we have. Peas and beans are very
important foods in Europe. In this country we consume enormous
quantities of beans. In Mexico they use a great deal of frijoles, the
poor people having this bean at nearly every meal. In China they make
the soy beans into various dishes. The lentil is much used in Europe and
is gaining favor here, as it should, for it is splendid food, with a
flavor of its own. Peanuts, which are really not nuts, but leguminous
plants growing their seeds under the ground, are used extensively as
food for man and beast.</p>

<p id="id00621" class="calibre1">These foods are much alike in composition, the soy bean being
exceptionally rich in protein.</p>

<p id="id00622" class="calibre1">These foods have the undeserved reputation of being indigestible and of
producing flatulence. They are a little more difficult to digest than
some other foods, but they cause no trouble if they are taken in simple
combinations and in moderation, provided they have been properly
prepared.</p>

<p id="id00623" class="calibre1">It is necessary to masticate these foods very well, and avoid
overeating. They are generally so soft that they are swallowed without
proper mouth preparation. The result is that too much is taken of these
rich foods, after which there is indigestion accompanied by gas
production.</p>

<p id="id00624" class="calibre1">One rather peculiar food belonging to the legumes is the locust bean or
St. John's bread, which we can sometimes obtain at the candy stores. It
grows near the Mediterranean and is used in places for cattle feed. It
is so sweet that it is eaten as a confection. Its name is due to the
fact that they say St. John lived on this bean and wild honey. If he did
he must have had a sweet tooth. Others say that the saint really
devoured grasshoppers. It is not easy to decide, but I prefer to believe
that he was a vegetarian.</p>

<h4 id="id00625" class="calibre14">COOKING.</h4>

<p id="id00626" class="calibre1">The fresh young legumes are to be considered in the same class as
succulent vegetables, which are dealt with in the next chapter.</p>

<p id="id00627" class="calibre1">Ripe peas, beans and lentils may be cooked alike.</p>

<p id="id00628" class="calibre1">In cooking ripe legumes, try to get as soft water as possible. Hard
water contains salts of lime and magnesia and these prevent the
softening of the legumes.</p>

<p id="id00629" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Bean soup</i>: Clean the beans and wash them. Let them soak over night.
Cook them in the same water in which they have been soaked, until
tender. They are to be cooked in plain water without any seasoning and
with the addition of neither fats, starches nor other vegetables. When
the beans are done, meat stock and other vegetables may be added, if
desired. Pea soup is made in the same way.</p>

<p id="id00630" class="calibre1">The reason for not draining away the water in which the beans are soaked
is that it takes up some of the valuable salts, the phosphates for
instance. The addition of seasoning or fat while they are cooking makes
the beans indigestible.</p>

<p id="id00631" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Baked beans</i>: Clean and wash well. Soak them over night. Let them boil
about three and one-half to four hours, using the water in which they
were soaked. Then put them into the oven to bake. They are to be cooked
plain and no fat or seasoning is to be added while they are baking.
After they are done you may add some form of fatty dressing, such as
bacon, which has been stewed in a separate dish, or you may dress them
with butter and salt when they are served. Cooked this way they digest
much more easily than when cooked in the ordinary way with tomatoes and
grease. Some prefer to add either sugar or molasses to the beans when
they are put into the oven. Avoid too much sweetening. Lentils may be
baked in the same way.</p>

<p id="id00632" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Boiled beans</i>: The same as bean soup, except that less water is used.
Dressing may be the same as for baked beans. Lentils and peas may be
treated in the same way.</p>

<p id="id00633" class="calibre1">Beans and corn may be cooked together.</p>

<h4 id="id00634" class="calibre14">COMBINATIONS.</h4>

<p id="id00635" class="calibre1">The legumes are so very rich that they should be eaten in very simple
combinations. It is best to take them with some of the raw salad
vegetables and nothing else, or with the raw salad vegetables and one of
the stewed succulent vegetables. The legumes contain all the protein and
all the force food the body needs, so it is useless to add meat, bread
and potatoes. Tomatoes and other acid foods should not be used in the
same meal, yet beans and tomatoes or beans and catsup are very common
combinations.</p>

<p id="id00636" class="calibre1">A plate of bean soup makes a good lunch. Bean soup or baked or boiled
beans with succulent vegetables, raw and cooked, give all the
nourishment needed in a dinner.</p>

<p id="id00637" class="calibre1">Pea and bean flours can be purchased on the market. These flours can not
be made into dough, but they may be used for thickening. They contain
more protein than ordinary flour.</p>

<p id="id00638" class="calibre1">Both peas and beans may be roasted, but they are rather difficult to
masticate. Roasted peas have a fine flavor. Roasted peanuts are a
nutritious food, and may be taken in place of peas or beans.</p>

<p id="id00639" class="calibre1">More legumes and less flesh foods will help to reduce the cost of
living. Taken in moderation and well masticated, the legumes are
excellent foods.</p>

<p id="id00643" class="calibre1">Lima beans and shelled peas are generally included in this list, though
the young lima beans contain about 20 per cent. starch.</p>

<p id="id00644" class="calibre1">Look at the cabbage analysis for kale and Brussels sprouts. They are
much alike.</p>

<p id="id00645" class="calibre1">Most of the vegetables contain from one-half of one per cent. to two per

rich in protein, fat and carbohydrates, but they have considerable
salts, which are given in the tables as ash. Their juices help to keep
the blood alkaline, and it would be well for people to get into the
habit of eating these foods, not only cooked, but some of them raw. The
salts are very easily disturbed and in cooking they are somewhat
changed. The best salts we get when we consume natural foods, such as
raw fruits and raw vegetables and milk.</p>

<p id="id00648" class="calibre1">Another function of the succulent vegetables is to take up space in the
stomach. Many like to eat until they feel comfortably full, but if they
indulge in concentrated foods to this extent they overeat. The succulent
vegetables have the merit of taking up much space without furnishing
very much nourishment and they should, therefore, be used as
space-fillers. However, they contain enough nourishment to be well worth
eating, and most of them are excellent in flavor. This flavor is not
appreciated by those who eat much meat and drink much alcohol.</p>

<p id="id00649" class="calibre1">The liberal use of these cooked vegetables has a tendency to prevent
constipation, and some of them are called laxative foods, such as stewed
onions and spinach.</p>

<h4 id="id00650" class="calibre14">PREPARATION.</h4>

<p id="id00651" class="calibre1">These vegetables may be either steamed or prepared in a fireless cooker.</p>

<p id="id00652" class="calibre1">The usual way is to cook them in water. Clean the vegetables. Then put
them on to cook in enough water to keep from burning, but use no
seasoning. When the vegetables are tender there should be only a little
fluid left and those who eat of the vegetables should take their share
of this fluid, for it may contain as high as one-half to two-thirds of
the salts. When served, let each one season to taste. Avoid the use of
vinegar and all other products of fermentation as much as possible.
Lemon juice will furnish all the acid needed for dressing.</p>

<p id="id00653" class="calibre1">The vegetables may be dressed with salt, or salt and butter, or salt and
olive oil, and at times with cream, or with the natural gravy from
meats, but avoid the use of flour and milk dressings, usually called
cream gravy. These vegetables may also be eaten without any dressing.</p>

<p id="id00654" class="calibre1">The water is drained off from corn on the cob, asparagus, artichokes and
unpeeled beets.</p>

<p id="id00655" class="calibre1">Vegetables should not be soaked in water, for they lose a part of their
value if this is done. Cucumbers may be soaked in water to remove a part
of the rank flavor, before being peeled.</p>

<p id="id00656" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Spinach</i> is prepared as follows: Wash thoroughly. Put about two
tablespoonfuls of water in the bottom of the kettle. Put over the fire
and let the spinach wilt. Its juice will then begin to pour out and the
spinach will cook in its own juice. Let it cook slowly until tender.
Serve the spinach with its proportion of the juice. At first this will
taste rather strong, but after a while a person will not want the dry,
tasteless mess that is drained, usually served in hotels and
restaurants. If some of the roots are left on the spinach, it tastes
milder. The roots contain sugar.</p>

<p id="id00657" class="calibre1">Some of these vegetables, such as summer squash, onions and parsnips may
be baked. Onions are very good sliced and broiled, but they should never
be fried. Beets are good baked, and especially is this true of sugar
beets. Radishes are very delicate and delicious when peeled and boiled,
but their preparation is tedious. Egg plant is to be stewed, but not
fried. As usually served, dipped in egg, rolled in crumbs and fried it
is very indigestible.</p>

<p id="id00658" class="calibre1">Beet greens are excellent. They are best if the beets are pulled very
young and both the roots and the leaves are used. Turnip tops,
dandelion, mustard and Swiss chard are other greens that are good. All
of them are prepared like spinach, except that more water is necessary.
However, do not use much water.</p>

<p id="id00659" class="calibre1">Those who say that the various vegetables are unfit to eat and act
accordingly are missing some good food. The vegetables all contain crude
fibre, but they hurt the stomach and intestinal walls no more than they
hurt the mucous membrane of the tongue. They furnish some bulk for the
intestines to act upon, which is good and proper. All animals need some
bulky food, otherwise they become constipated.</p>

<p id="id00660" class="calibre1">Tomatoes are best raw. If they are stewed they are to be cooked plain.
Adding crackers and bread crumbs is a mistake. They taste all right
without sugar, but a little may be used as dressing.</p>

<p id="id00661" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Vegetable soup</i>: Take equal parts of about four vegetables, any that
you like. Slice and cook in plain water until tender. When done add
enough water or hot milk to make it of the right consistency. Season to
taste. One of the constituents may be starchy, such as potatoes, barley
or rice, but the rest should be succulent vegetables.</p>

<h4 id="id00662" class="calibre14">COMBINATIONS.</h4>

<p id="id00663" class="calibre1">The succulent vegetables may be combined with all other foods. They go
well with flesh or milk or nuts or starchy foods. With flesh or nuts
they make a very satisfying meal. They may be taken with fruit. The
tomato grows as a vegetable, but for practical purposes it is a fruit.
The tomato combines well with protein, but not so well with the starchy
foods.</p>

<h4 id="id00664" class="calibre14">SALAD VEGETABLES.</h4>

<p id="id00665" class="calibre1">If possible, salads should be made entirely of raw vegetables and raw
fruits. The chief salad vegetables are celery, lettuce, tomatoes,
cucumbers, cabbage, onions and garlic, the two last mentioned being used
for flavoring.</p>

<p id="id00666" class="calibre1">Dr. Tilden, who has done much to popularize raw vegetable salads, has a
favorite, which he calls by his own name. It is equal parts of lettuce,
tomatoes and cucumbers, with a small piece of onion. Chop up coarse and
dress with salt and olive oil and lemon juice. This is all right for
those who like it, but many do not care for such a complex salad with
such dressing. Some of the combination salads that are served are
wonderful mixtures, containing as many as seven or eight vegetables and
a complex dressing.</p>

<p id="id00667" class="calibre1">Raw onions are too irritating to use in large quantities, and the same
is true of garlic. The best salads contain but two or three ingredients.
Take any two of the vegetables mentioned, such as lettuce and tomatoes;
lettuce and cucumbers; cabbage and celery; celery and tomatoes, or eat
simply one of these green vegetables raw. It is a good thing to eat some
of those salad vegetables daily. If your  digestion is excellent, you
may occasionally take raw carrots or turnips, and a few raw spinach
leaves are tasty for a change. Never mind if people tease you about
eating grass, for it helps you to keep well.</p>

<p id="id00668" class="calibre1">Dress the raw vegetables as your taste allows. Most people want some
salt, or salt and lemon juice, or a little sugar, or cream, or salt and
olive oil, or salt, olive oil and lemon juice, or mayonnaise on their
salad vegetables. Some eat them without any dressing and the flavor is
excellent. Tasty salad can be made of fruit and vegetables, using no
dressing, but strewing some nuts over the dish. On warm days, such a
salad makes a satisfactory lunch.</p>

<p id="id00669" class="calibre1">It is all right to make a fruit and vegetable salad. Instead of using
tomatoes, take strawberries, apples, grapes, or any other acid fruit.
These fruits may be combined with cabbage, lettuce, celery or cucumbers.
Do not mix too many foods in a meal, for to do so is indicative of poor
taste. Those with refined palates like simple meals, and there is no
reason for making salads so complex, when simplicity is a requirement
for building health. However, a complex salad made of raw vegetables and
raw juicy fruits does not play so much havoc as a mixture of
concentrated foods.</p>

<p id="id00670" class="calibre1">Lettuce and celery are the most satisfactory salad vegetables to mix
with fruits.</p>

<p id="id00671" class="calibre1">People who eat raw fruits do not need to eat the raw salad vegetables,
for fruits and vegetables supply the same salts. Those who avoid both
raw fruits and raw vegetables are not treating their bodies fairly.</p>

<p id="id00672" class="calibre1">The vegetable salads are most satisfactory when taken in combination
with flesh, nuts or eggs, together with cooked succulent vegetables.
They may be eaten with starchy foods, but then they should contain
little or no acid.</p>

<p id="id00676" class="calibre1">The cereal foods are important because of their wide distribution and
the ease with which they can be prepared and utilized as food. They are
very productive and need but little care and hence are a cheap food. The
body can digest and absorb sugar and starch more completely than any
other kind of food.</p>

<p id="id00677" class="calibre1">All civilized people have a favorite cereal. The Chinese and Japanese
use rice very extensively, and this grain is growing in favor with us.
White people generally prefer wheat, which is an excellent grain that
has been used by man for thousands of years. It has been found in
ancient Egyptian tombs, and it is so retentive of life that it has
started to grow after lying dormant for several thousand years. Truly it
is a worthy food for man.</p>

<p id="id00678" class="calibre1">The table of cereals should be carefully studied. It will be seen that
the grains contain much starch, a little fat, and considerable protein.
They also carry sufficient of salts, but only a small amount of water.</p>

<p id="id00679" class="calibre1">Please note further that patent flour loses nearly all of its salts.
Patent flour is the product that is left after all the bran and
practically all of the germ have been removed from the wheat. Whole
wheat flour, or entire wheat flour, is the name given to the flour that
has had a great part of the outer covering of the wheat kernel removed.
It is a misnomer. Graham flour, named after Dr. Graham, is the product
of the whole wheat kernel, and it will be noted that it is richer in
salts and protein than the white flour and the whole wheat flour. The
whole wheat flour and Graham flour we find on the market are often the
result of blending, which is also true of the patent flour.</p>

<p id="id00680" class="calibre1">As we would expect, the various breads are rich or poor in salts
according to the flours from which they are made.</p>

<p id="id00681" class="calibre1">All the cereals are good foods, but inasmuch as wheat and rice are used
most extensively, they will receive more attention than the rest.</p>

<p id="id00682" class="calibre1">Wheat is perhaps the best and most balanced of all our cereals. The
whole wheat with the addition of a little milk is sufficient to support
life indefinitely. It is one of the foods of which people never seem to
tire. Tiring of food is often an indication of excess. It is with food
as with amusement, if we get too much we become blase. Those who eat in
moderation are content with simple foods, but those who eat too much
want a great variety, as a rule. There are beef gluttons, who are
satisfied with their flesh and liquor, but this is because the meats are
so stimulating.</p>

<p id="id00683" class="calibre1">Inasmuch as we use so much wheat, it is important that we use it
properly. Today people want refined foods, and in refining they spoil
many of our best food products. Sugar is too refined for health, rice
suffers through refinement, and so does wheat. The wheat kernel contains
all the elements needed to support life. In making fine white flour of
it, at least three-fourths of the essential salts are removed. This robs
the wheat of a large part of its life-imparting elements, and makes of
it starvation food. If much white bread is consumed it is necessary to
supplement it by taking large quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables,
not necessarily in the same meal, in order to get the salts that have
been removed in the process of milling.</p>

<p id="id00684" class="calibre1">The salts are found principally in the coats of the wheat, and in
removing these coats and the germ, not only the salts, but considerable
protein is lost. In other words, we remove most of the essential salts
and a considerable part of the building material of the wheat, and then
we eat the inferior product. The finer and whiter the flour, the poorer
it is.</p>

<p id="id00685" class="calibre1">White flour has a very high starch content. The products made from it
are quite tasteless and lacking in flavor, unless flavoring is added.
Those who are used to whole wheat products find the white bread flat. It
is possible to consume large quantities of white bread, and yet not be
satisfied. There is something lacking. Whole wheat bread is more
satisfying and therefore the danger of overeating of it is not so great.</p>

<p id="id00686" class="calibre1">The advocates of white flour say that the bran is too irritating for the
bowels and for this reason it should be rejected. There is no danger in
eating the entire kernel, after it is ground up. The particles of bran
are so fine that they do no harm. The intestines were evidently intended
for a little roughage, and it might as well come partly from wheat as
from other sources. The gentle stimulation produced by the bran helps to
keep the intestines active. It is noticeable that consumption of very
refined foods leads to constipation.</p>

<p id="id00687" class="calibre1">Bran bread and bran biscuits are prescribed for constipation. This is
just as bad as removing the bran entirely. Man has never been able to
improve on the composition of the wheat berry. When an excess of bran is
eaten, it causes too great irritation and in the end the individual is
worse off than before. The after effect of irritation is always
depression and sluggishness. Recent experiments seem to show that it is
not the coarseness of the bran that causes activity of the bowels, but
that some of the contained salts are laxative, for the same results have
been obtained by soaking the bran in water and drinking the liquid.</p>

<p id="id00688" class="calibre1">The products of refined flour are more completely and easily digested
than the whole wheat products. However, by eating in moderation and
masticating well every normal person is able to take good care of whole
wheat products, and the benefit of using the entire grain is so great
that we should hesitate about continuing the use of the refined flours
and white breads.</p>

<p id="id00689" class="calibre1">In the French army it has been found that when the soldiers are fed on
refined flour products they are not so well nourished as when they have
whole wheat products, and that they must have more of other foods to
supplement the impoverished breadstuffs. It is difficult to get people
to realize how important it is to give the tissue salts with the foods.
Salts are absolutely essential to vital activity, and a lack of salts
always results in mental and physical depression and even in disease.</p>

<p id="id00690" class="calibre1">No matter what adults are given, children should not be fed on white
flour products. They need all the salts in the wheat. Depriving them of
salts retards their development and results in decaying teeth and poor
bone formation, among other things. They do not feel satisfied with
their white flour foods. Therefore they overeat and get indigestion,
catarrh, adenoids and various other ills. It is not difficult for people
with observing eyes to note the difference in satisfaction of children
after they get impoverished foods and the natural foods.</p>

<p id="id00691" class="calibre1">Anemia is very common among children, especially among the girls. The
chief reason is impoverished foods. Salts can be used by the animal
organism only after they have been elaborated by the vegetable kingdom.
To remove all the iron from wheat and then give inorganic iron, which
can not be assimilated, in its stead, is the height of folly. By all
means, use less of the white flour and more of the entire wheat flour.
If the white flour habit can not be given up, take enough raw fruit and
vegetables to make up for the loss of salts in milling.</p>

<p id="id00692" class="calibre1">When rice is properly prepared it digests very easily. It is a little
poor in protein, but this can be remedied by taking some milk in the
same meal.</p>

<p id="id00693" class="calibre1">The rice we ordinarily get is inferior to the natural product. First
they remove the bran. Then the flour is taken off. Then it is coated
with a mixture of glucose and talcum and polished. All this trouble is
taken to make it appeal to the eye. This impoverished rice is lacking in
salts. It will not support people in health. In the countries where
polished rice is fed in great quantities, they suffer a great deal from
degenerative diseases. One of these is beri-beri, in which there are
muscular weakness and degeneration, indigestion, disturbances of the
heart and often times anasarca. When people suffering from this disease
are given those parts of the rice grain lost in making polished rice,
they recover. This is proof enough that the cause of the disease is the
impoverished food.</p>

<p id="id00694" class="calibre1">The rice that should be used is brown and unpolished. When it is cooked
it looks quite white. It is very satisfying.</p>

<p id="id00695" class="calibre1">Rye is extensively used in some lands. The bread is very good. Oats are
largely devoured in Scotland. Corn bread is a favorite food in the
southern part of our country. The negroes are fond of corn and pork with
molasses, which is far from an ideal combination in warm climates.</p>

<h4 id="id00696" class="calibre14">PREPARATIONS.</h4>

<p id="id00697" class="calibre1">Wheat makes the best bread because it contains gluten. Among proteins
gluten is unique, because it is so elastic and after it has stretched it
has a tendency to retain its place. This is what makes bread so porous.
There are various meals or flours that can not be made into bread, or
even dough, because they lack compounds which will act as frame work.</p>

<p id="id00698" class="calibre1">Bread can be made in many ways. The chief question for the housewife to
decide is whether to make the bread from entire wheat flour or from
patent flour. They are so different in value that a decision should not
be difficult. It is also necessary to decide whether to use yeast bread
or some other kind.</p>

<p id="id00699" class="calibre1">Yeast bread is made essentially from flour, water and yeast in the
presence of heat. There are so many ways of making bread of this kind
that a recipe is not necessary. The amount of salt to be added depends
upon individual taste. Some like to set their yeast working in part
potato, part flour. Others use milk instead of water. Some add
shortening. And nearly all women believe that their own bread is the
best.</p>

<p id="id00700" class="calibre1">Yeast is made up of myriads of little plants or fungi, which thrive on
the sugary part of the flour. They convert this into alcohol and
carbonic acid gas. The alcohol is practically all gone before the bread
is brought to the table. The gas raises the bread, assisted by the
expansion of the water in the dough when it is placed in a hot oven.</p>

<p id="id00701" class="calibre1">The yeast consumes a great deal of the nutritive part of the flour. This
may amount to from 5 to 8 per cent. of the food value, and I have read
that sometimes it is as high as 20 per cent. Liebig said that the
fermentation destroyed enough food material daily in Germany to supply
400,000 people with bread. However, yeast bread is very agreeable to the
taste and therefore is probably worth more than the unfermented product.</p>

<p id="id00702" class="calibre1">One objection to yeast bread is that all the yeast is not killed in
baking, and the alcoholic fermentation may start again in the stomach.
If the bread is turned into zwieback this is remedied. Fresh bread is
not fit to eat, for it is very rarely properly masticated and if it is
merely moistened and converted into a soggy mass in the mouth it is hard
to digest.</p>

<p id="id00703" class="calibre1">Unleavened bread is made by making the flour into a paste, rolling out
thin and baking well. Any kind of flour may be used. This is the
passover bread of the Jews.</p>

<p id="id00704" class="calibre1">Dr. Graham's bread was made by mixing Graham flour with water, without
any leavening, mixing the dough thoroughly, putting this aside several
hours and baking.</p>

<p id="id00705" class="calibre1">Macaroni and spaghetti are made by mixing durum wheat flour with water,
without any leavening. With the addition of eggs we get commercial
noodles. The paste is moulded as desired.</p>

<p id="id00706" class="calibre1">All bread stuffs should be well baked.. The baking turns part of the
starch into dextrine, which is easy to digest. Biscuits should be placed
into a hot oven, but bread should be put into an oven moderately heated,
otherwise the crust forms too quickly.</p>

<p id="id00707" class="calibre1">Whenever a light product is desired, whether it is bread, biscuit or
cake, sift the flour over and over again to get it well impregnated with
air. The more air it contains the more porous will be the finished
product. Five or six siftings will suffice.</p>

<p id="id00708" class="calibre1">Unleavened breads of excellent flavor can be made by using either cream
or butter as shortening, rolling the bread very thin, like crackers, and
baking thoroughly.</p>

<p id="id00709" class="calibre1">Shredded wheat biscuits, puffed wheat and puffed rice, flaked wheat and
flaked corn are some of the good foods we can purchase ready made. Most
of them should be placed in a warm oven long enough to crisp. Masticate
thoroughly and take them with either butter or milk, or both. It is best
to take the milk either before or after eating the cereal. Sugar should
not be added to these foods. Those who are not hungry enough to eat them
without sugar should fast until normal hunger returns.</p>

<p id="id00710" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Baking powder bread</i> is very good. The essentials are well sifted
flour, liquid, good baking powder, quick mixing and a hot oven. The
following recipe, recommended by Dr. Tilden, is good: To a quart of very
best flour, which has been sifted two or three times, add a little salt
and a heaping teaspoonful of baking powder. Sift again three times. Then
add one or two tablespoonfuls of soft butter. Mix rapidly into a rather
stiff dough with unskimmed milk. The dough should be rolled thin, and
cut into small biscuits or strips. Put into a pan and bake in a hot oven
until there is a crisp crust on bottom and top, which will take about
twenty minutes. The more thoroughly and quickly the dough is mixed, the
better the result.</p>

<p id="id00711" class="calibre1">These biscuits or bread sticks are good, always best when made rather
thin, not to exceed an inch in thickness after being baked. When an
attempt is made to bake in the form of a fairly thick loaf it is
generally a failure. Use the proportions of white and whole wheat flours
desired.</p>

<p id="id00712" class="calibre1">If more butter or some cream is added and it is rolled out thin, it
serves very well for the bread part of shortcake.</p>

<p id="id00713" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Toast</i>: Slice any kind of bread fairly thin, preferably stale bread.
Place the slices into a moderately hot oven and let them remain there
until they are crisp through and through. The scorched bread that is
generally served as toast is no better than untoasted bread.</p>

<p id="id00714" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Whole wheat muffins</i>: One cup whole wheat flour; one cup white flour;
one-fourth cup sugar; one teaspoonful salt; one cup milk; one egg; two
tablespoonfuls melted butter; four teaspoonfuls baking powder. Mix dry
ingredients; add milk gradually, then eggs and melted butter. Put into
gem pans and bake in hot oven for twenty-five minutes.</p>

<p id="id00715" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Ginger bread</i>: One cup molasses; one and three-fourths teaspoons soda;
one-half cup sour milk; two cups flour; one-half teaspoon salt;
one-third cup butter; two eggs; two teaspoonfuls ginger. Put butter and
molasses in sauce pan and heat until boiling point is reached. Remove
from fire, add soda and beat vigorously. Then add milk, egg well beaten,
and remaining ingredients mixed and sifted. Bake twenty-five minutes in
buttered, shallow pan in moderate oven.</p>

<p id="id00716" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Custard</i>: Three cups milk; three eggs; one-half cup sugar; one-half
teaspoonful vanilla; pinch of salt. Beat eggs, add sugar and salt; then
add scalded milk and vanilla; mix well. Pour into cups, place them in a
pan of hot water in oven and bake twenty to twenty-five minutes. Serve
cold.</p>

<p id="id00717" class="calibre1">Custard may also be cooked in double boiler or baked in a large pan.</p>

<p id="id00718" class="calibre1">This is not a cereal dish, but the next one is.</p>

<p id="id00719" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Rice custard</i>: To well cooked rice add a few raisins and a small amount
of sugar. The raisins can be cooked with the rice or separately. Place
the rice and raisins in a baking dish, pour over an equal amount of raw
custard and bake as directed for custard. Bake in either individual cups
or pan. When done the layer of custard is on top and the rice and
raisins on the bottom.</p>

<p id="id00720" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Macaroni and cheese</i>: Three-fourths cup macaroni broken in pieces; two
quarts boiling water; one-half table-spoonful salt. Cook macaroni in
salted water twenty minutes, or longer if necessary to make it tender;
drain. Put layer of macaroni in buttered baking dish; sprinkle with
cheese, and repeat, making the last or top layer of cheese. Pour in milk
to almost cover. Put into oven and bake until the top layer of cheese is
brown.</p>

<p id="id00721" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Corn bread</i>: Two cups corn meal; one-half cup wheat flour; one
tablespoonful sugar; one-half teaspoonful salt; two teaspoonfuls baking
powder; two eggs; one and three-fourths cups milk. Sift corn meal,
flour, baking powder, salt and sugar together four or five times; add
eggs and milk; stir well, pour into a hot buttered pan; smooth the top
with a little melted butter to crisp the crust. Bake a good brown in hot
oven.</p>

<p id="id00722" class="calibre1">Another recipe for corn bread is: To one cup of wheat flour, add two
cups of corn flour; two eggs; one heaping teaspoonful butter or
cottolene; one heaping teaspoonful baking powder; one pinch soda, a
scant fourth teaspoonful; one-half teaspoonful salt. Prepare and make
into batter with milk and bake as directed in first recipe.</p>

<p id="id00723" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Corn mush</i>: Cook corn meal in plain water until it is done. It may be
cooked over the fire, in a fireless cooker or in a double boiler. Serve
with rich milk; add a little salt if desired.</p>

<p id="id00724" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Oatmeal</i>: Put into a double boiler and let it cook until it is very
tender. It can also be cooked in a fireless cooker over night. It
requires several hours cooking before it is fit to eat. All foods of
this nature should be thoroughly cooked, and they may all be made into
porridge, which is better.</p>

<p id="id00725" class="calibre1">The objection to all mushy foods is that they are hardly ever properly
masticated. The result is that they ferment in the alimentary tract,
especially when they are eaten with sugar, as they generally are. It is
best to take the  mushy foods with milk and a little salt or with
butter. Eaten in this way there is not such tendency to overeat as when
sugar is used. Children especially eat more of these foods than is good
for them if they are allowed to take them with sweets. Porridge is more
diluted than the mushes and hence the danger of overeating is not so
great.</p>

<p id="id00726" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Boiled rice</i>: The best way to cook it is in a double boiler or a
fireless cooker. Every grain should be tender. Cook it in plan water. It
is not necessary to stir, but if the rice becomes dry add some more
water. If rice and milk are desired, warm the milk and add when the rice
is done. Serve like oatmeal. Putting sugar on cereals is nonsense. They
are very rich in starch and sugar is about the same as starch. Sugar
stimulates the appetite, and consequently people who use it on cereals
overeat of this concentrated food.</p>

<p id="id00727" class="calibre1"><i class="calibre7">Rice and raisins</i>: This is prepared the same as boiled rice, except
that raisins are added to the rice and water when first put on to cook.
With milk this makes a good breakfast or lunch.</p>
