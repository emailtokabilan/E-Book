<p class="calibre1"><a id="p3"></a>—R.W.C. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	bullet	entered	here,”	said	Max	Fortin,	and	he	placed	his	middle	finger	over a	smooth	hole	exactly	in	the	centre	of	the	forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	down	upon	a	mound	of	dry	seaweed	and	unslung	my	fowling	piece. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	little	chemist	cautiously	felt	the	edges	of	the	shot-hole,	first	with	his	middle finger,	then	with	his	thumb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	me	see	the	skull	again,”	said	I. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Max	Fortin	picked	it	up	from	the	sod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	like	all	the	others,”	he	observed.	I	nodded,	without	offering	to	take	it	from him.	After	a	moment	he	thoughtfully	replaced	it	upon	the	grass	at	my	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	like	all	the	others,”	he	repeated,	wiping	his	glasses	on	his	handkerchief.	“I thought	you	might	care	to	see	one	of	the	skulls,	so	I	brought	this	over	from	the gravel	pit.	The	men	from	Bannalec	are	digging	yet.	They	ought	to	stop.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	many	skulls	are	there	altogether?”	I	inquired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	found	thirty-eight	skulls;	there	are	thirty-nine	noted	in	the	list.	They	lie piled	up	in	the	gravel	pit	on	the	edge	of	Le	Bihan’s	wheat	field.	The	men	are	at work	yet.	Le	Bihan	is	going	to	stop	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	go	over,”	said	I;	and	I	picked	up	my	gun	and	started	across	the	cliffs, Fortin	on	one	side,	Môme	on	the	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	has	the	list?”	I	asked,	lighting	my	pipe.	“You	say	there	is	a	list?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	list	was	found	rolled	up	in	a	brass	cylinder,”	said	the	little	chemist.	He added:	“You	should	not	smoke	here.	You	know	that	if	a	single	spark	drifted	into the	wheat—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	but	I	have	a	cover	to	my	pipe,”	said	I,	smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fortin	watched	me	as	I	closed	the	pepper-box	arrangement	over	the	glowing bowl	of	the	pipe.	Then	he	continued:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p4"></a>“The	list	was	made	out	on	thick	yellow	paper;	the	brass	tube	has	preserved	it.	It is	as	fresh	to-day	as	it	was	in	1760.	You	shall	see	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	that	the	date?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	list	is	dated	‘April,	1760.’	The	Brigadier	Durand	has	it.	It	is	not	written	in French.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nor	written	in	French!”	I	exclaimed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	replied	Fortin	solemnly,	“it	is	written	in	Breton.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,”	I	protested,	“the	Breton	language	was	never	written	or	printed	in	1760.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Except	by	priests,”	said	the	chemist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	heard	of	but	one	priest	who	ever	wrote	the	Breton	language,”	I	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fortin	stole	a	glance	at	my	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	mean—the	Black	Priest?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fortin	opened	his	mouth	to	speak	again,	hesitated,	and	finally	shut	his	teeth obstinately	over	the	wheat	stem	that	he	was	chewing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	the	Black	Priest?”	I	suggested	encouragingly.	But	I	knew	it	was	useless; for	it	is	easier	to	move	the	stars	from	their	courses	than	to	make	an	obstinate Breton	talk.	We	walked	on	for	a	minute	or	two	in	silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	is	the	Brigadier	Durand?”	I	asked,	motioning	Môme	to	come	out	of	the wheat,	which	he	was	trampling	as	though	it	were	heather.	As	I	spoke	we	came	in sight	of	the	farther	edge	of	the	wheat	field	and	the	dark,	wet	mass	of	cliffs beyond. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Durand	is	down	there—you	can	see	him;	he	stands	just	behind	the	Mayor	of	St. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gildas.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	see,”	said	I;	and	we	struck	straight	down,	following	a	sun-baked	cattle	path across	the	heather. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p5"></a>When	we	reached	the	edge	of	the	wheat	field,	Le	Bihan,	the	Mayor	of	St.	Gildas, called	to	me,	and	I	tucked	my	gun	under	my	arm	and	skirted	the	wheat	to	where he	stood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thirty-eight	skulls,”	he	said	in	his	thin,	high-pitched	voice;	“there	is	but	one more,	and	I	am	opposed	to	further	search.	I	suppose	Fortin	told	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	hands	with	him,	and	returned	the	salute	of	the	Brigadier	Durand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	opposed	to	further	search,”	repeated	Le	Bihan,	nervously	picking	at	the mass	of	silver	buttons	which	covered	the	front	of	his	velvet	and	broadcloth jacket	like	a	breastplate	of	scale	armour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Durand	pursed	up	his	lips,	twisted	his	tremendous	mustache,	and	hooked	his thumbs	in	his	sabre	belt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	for	me,”	he	said,	“I	am	in	favour	of	further	search.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Further	search	for	what—for	the	thirty-ninth	skull?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Le	Bihan	nodded.	Durand	frowned	at	the	sunlit	sea,	rocking	like	a	bowl	of molten	gold	from	the	cliffs	to	the	horizon.	I	followed	his	eyes.	On	the	dark glistening	cliffs,	silhouetted	against	the	glare	of	the	sea,	sat	a	cormorant,	black, motionless,	its	horrible	head	raised	toward	heaven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	is	that	list,	Durand?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	gendarme	rummaged	in	his	despatch	pouch	and	produced	a	brass	cylinder about	a	foot	long.	Very	gravely	he	unscrewed	the	head	and	dumped	out	a	scroll of	thick	yellow	paper	closely	covered	with	writing	on	both	sides.	At	a	nod	from Le	Bihan	he	handed	me	the	scroll.	But	I	could	make	nothing	of	the	coarse writing,	now	faded	to	a	dull	brown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come,	come,	Le	Bihan,”	I	said	impatiently,	“translate	it,	won’t	you?	You	and Max	Fortin	make	a	lot	of	mystery	out	of	nothing,	it	seems.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Le	Bihan	went	to	the	edge	of	the	pit	where	the	three	Bannalec	men	were	digging, gave	an	order	or	two	in	Breton,	and	turned	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	came	to	the	edge	of	the	pit	the	Bannalec	men	were	removing	a	square	piece</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p6"></a>of	sailcloth	from	what	appeared	to	be	a	pile	of	cobblestones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look!”	said	Le	Bihan	shrilly.	I	looked.	The	pile	below	was	a	heap	of	skulls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	moment	I	clambered	down	the	gravel	sides	of	the	pit	and	walked	over	to the	men	of	Bannalec.	They	saluted	me	gravely,	leaning	on	their	picks	and shovels,	and	wiping	their	swearing	faces	with	sunburned	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	many?”	said	I	in	Breton. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thirty-eight,”	they	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	glanced	around.	Beyond	the	heap	of	skulls	lay	two	piles	of	human	bones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beside	these	was	a	mound	of	broken,	rusted	bits	of	iron	and	steel.	Looking closer,	I	saw	that	this	mound	was	composed	of	rusty	bayonets,	sabre	blades, scythe	blades,	with	here	and	there	a	tarnished	buckle	attached	to	a	bit	of	leather hard	as	iron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	picked	up	a	couple	of	buttons	and	a	belt	plate.	The	buttons	bore	the	royal	arms of	England;	the	belt	plate	was	emblazoned	with	the	English	arms,	and	also	with the	number	“27.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	heard	my	grandfather	speak	of	the	terrible	English	regiment,	the	27th Foot,	which	landed	and	stormed	the	fort	up	there,”	said	one	of	the	Bannalec men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh!”	said	I;	“then	these	are	the	bones	of	English	soldiers?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	said	the	men	of	Bannalec. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Le	Bihan	was	calling	to	me	from	the	edge	of	the	pit	above,	and	I	handed	the	belt plate	and	buttons	to	the	men	and	climbed	the	side	of	the	excavation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,”	said	I,	trying	to	prevent	Môme	from	leaping	up	and	licking	my	face	as	I emerged	from	the	pit,	“I	suppose	you	know	what	these	bones	are.	What	arc	you going	to	do	with	them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	was	a	man,”	said	Le	Bihan	angrily,	“an	Englishman,	who	passed	here	in	a dog-cart	on	his	way	to	Quimper	about	an	hour	ago,	and	what	do	you	suppose	he wished	to	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a>“Buy	the	relics?”	I	asked,	smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly—the	pig!”	piped	the	mayor	of	St.	Gildas.	“Jean	Marie	Tregunc,	who found	the	bones,	was	standing	there	where	Max	Fortin	stands,	and	do	you	know what	he	answered?	He	spat	upon	the	ground,	and	said:	‘Pig	of	an	Englishman,	do you	take	me	for	a	desecrator	of	graves?’	“</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knew	Tregunc,	a	sober,	blue-eyed	Breton,	who	lived	from	one	year’s	end	to	the other	without	being	able	to	afford	a	single	bit	of	meat	for	a	meal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	much	did	the	Englishman	offer	Tregunc?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Two	hundred	francs	for	the	skulls	alone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	of	the	relic	hunters	and	the	relic	buyers	on	the	battlefields	of	our	civil war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Seventeen	hundred	and	sixty	is	long	ago,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Respect	for	the	dead	can	never	die,”	said	Fortin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	the	English	soldiers	came	here	to	kill	your	fathers	and	burn	your	homes,”	I continued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	were	murderers	and	thieves,	but—they	are	dead,”	said	Tregunc,	coming up	from	the	beach	below,	his	long	sea	rake	balanced	on	his	dripping	jersey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	much	do	you	earn	every	year,	Jean	Marie?”	I	asked,	turning	to	shake hands	with	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Two	hundred	and	twenty	francs,	monsieur.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Forty-five	dollars	a	year,”	I	said.	“Bah!	you	are	worth	more,	Jean.	Will	you	take care	of	my	garden	for	me?	My	wife	wished	me	to	ask	you.	I	think	it	would	be worth	one	hundred	francs	a	month	to	you	and	to	me.	Come	on,	Le	Bihan—come along,	Fortin—and	you,	Durand.	I	want	somebody	to	translate	that	list	into French	for	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tregunc	stood	gazing	at	me,	his	blue	eyes	dilated. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>“You	may	begin	at	once,”	I	said,	smiling,	“If	the	salary	suits	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	suits,”	said	Tregunc,	fumbling	for	his	pipe	in	a	silly	way	that	annoyed	Le Bihan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	go	and	begin	your	work,”	cried	the	mayor	impatiently;	and	Tregune started	across	the	moors	toward	St.	Gildas,	taking	off	his	velvet-rib-boned	cap	to me	and	gripping	his	sea	rake	very	hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	offer	him	more	than	my	salary,”	said	the	mayor,	after	a	moment’s contemplation	of	his	silver	buttons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pooh!”	said	I,	“what	do	you	do	for	your	salary	except	play	dominoes	with	Max Fortin	at	the	Groix	Inn?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Le	Bihan	turned	red,	but	Durand	rattled	his	sabre	and	winked	at	Max	Fortin,	and I	slipped	my	arm	through	the	arm	of	the	sulky	magistrate,	laughing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	a	shady	spot	under	the	cliff,”	I	said;	“come	on,	Le	Bihan,	and	read	me what	is	in	the	scroll.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	a	few	moments	we	reached	the	shadow	of	the	cliff,	and	I	threw	myself	upon the	turf,	chin	on	hand,	to	listen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	gendarme,	Durand,	also	sat	down,	twisting	his	mustache	into	needlelike points.	Fortin	leaned	against	the	cliff,	polishing	his	glasses	and	examining	us with	vague,	near-sighted	eyes;	and	Le	Bihan,	the	mayor,	planted	himself	in	our midst,	rolling	up	the	scroll	and	tucking	it	under	his	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“First	of	all,”	he	began	in	a	shrill	voice,	“I	am	going	to	light	my	pipe,	and	while lighting	it	I	shall	tell	you	what	I	have	heard	about	the	attack	on	the	fort	yonder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	father	told	me;	his	father	told	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	jerked	his	head	in	the	direction	of	the	ruined	fort,	a	small,	square	stone structure	on	the	sea	cliff,	now	nothing	but	crumbling	walls.	Then	he	slowly produced	a	tobacco	pouch,	a	bit	of	flint	and	tinder,	and	a	long-stemmed	pipe fitted	with	a	microscopical	bowl	of	baked	clay.	To	fill	such	a	pipe	requires	ten minutes’	close	attention.	To	smoke	it	to	a	finish	takes	but	four	puffs.	It	is	very Breton,	this	Breton	pipe.	It	is	the	crystallization	of	everything	Breton. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>“Go	on,”	said	I,	lighting	a	cigarette. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	fort,”	said	the	mayor,	“was	built	by	Louis	XIM	and	was	dismantled	twice by	the	English.	Louis	XV	restored	it	in	1739.	In	1760	it	was	carried	by	assault	by the	English.	They	came	across	from	the	island	of	Groix—three	shiploads—and they	stormed	the	fort	and	sacked	St.	Julien	yonder,	and	they	started	to	burn	St. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gildas—you	can	see	the	marks	of	their	bullets	on	my	house	yet;	but	the	men	of Bannalec	and	the	men	of	Lorient	fell	upon	them	with	pike	and	scythe	and blunderbuss,	and	those	who	did	not	run	away	lie	there	below	in	the	gravel	pit now—thirty-eight	of	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	the	thirty-ninth	skull?”	I	asked,	finishing	my	cigarette. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	mayor	had	succeeded	in	filling	his	pipe,	and	now	he	began	to	put	his tobacco	pouch	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	thirty-ninth	skull,”	he	mumbled,	holding	the	pipestem	between	his defective	teeth—“the	thirty-ninth	skull	is	no	business	of	mine.	I	have	told	the Bannalec	men	to	cease	digging.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	what	is—whose	is	the	missing	skull?”	I	persisted	curiously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	mayor	was	busy	trying	to	strike	a	spark	to	his	tinder.	Presently	he	set	it aglow,	applied	it	to	his	pipe,	took	the	prescribed	four	puffs,	knocked	the	ashes out	of	the	bowl,	and	gravely	replaced	the	pipe	in	his	pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	missing	skull?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	said	I	impatiently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	mayor	slowly	unrolled	the	scroll	and	began	to	read,	translating	from	the Breton	into	French.	And	this	is	what	he	read:</p>
<p class="calibre1">”	‘ON	THE	CLIFFS	OF	ST.	GILDAS,	“‘April	13,	1760. </p>
<p class="calibre1">”	‘On	this	day,	by	order	of	the	Count	of	Soisic,	general	in	chief	of	the	Breton forces	now	lying	in	Kerselec	Forest,	the	bodies	of	thirty-eight	English	soldiers	of the	27th,	50th,	and	72d	regiments	of	Foot	were	buried	in	this	spot,	together	with their	arms	and	equipments.”’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>The	mayor	paused	and	glanced	at	me	reflectively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	on,	Le	Bihan,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">”	‘With	them,’	”	continued	the	mayor,	turning	the	scroll	and	reading	on	the	other side,	”	‘was	buried	the	body	of	that	vile	traitor	who	betrayed	the	fort	to	the English.	The	manner	of	his	death	was	as	follows:	By	order	of	the	most	noble Count	of	Soisic,	the	traitor	was	first	branded	upon	the	forehead	with	the	brand	of an	arrowhead.	The	iron	burned	through	the	flesh,	and	was	pressed	heavily	so	that the	brand	should	even	burn	into	the	bone	of	the	skull.	The	traitor	was	then	led out	and	bidden	to	kneel.	He	admitted	having	guided	the	English	from	the	island of	Groix.	Although	a	priest	and	a	Frenchman,	he	had	violated	his	priestly	office to	aid	him	in	discovering	the	password	to	the	fort.	This	password	he	extorted during	confession	from	a	young	Breton	girl	who	was	in	the	habit	of	rowing across	from	the	island	of	Groix	to	visit	her	husband	in	the	fort.	When	the	fort fell,	this	young	girl,	crazed	by	the	death	of	her	husband,	sought	the	Count	of Soisic	and	told	how	the	priest	had	forced	her	to	confess	to	him	all	she	knew about	the	fort.	The	priest	was	arrested	at	St.	Gildas	as	he	was	about	to	cross	the river	to	Lorient.	When	arrested	he	cursed	the	girl,	Marie	Trevec—’	“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What!”	I	exclaimed,	“Marie	Trevec!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">”	‘Marie	Trevec,’	”	repeated	Le	Bihan;	”	‘the	priest	cursed	Marie	Trevec,	and	all her	family	and	descendants.	He	was	shot	as	he	knelt,	having	a	mask	of	leather over	his	face,	because	the	Bretons	who	composed	the	squad	of	execution	refused to	fire	at	a	priest	unless	his	face	was	concealed.	The	priest	was	l’Abbé	Sorgue, commonly	known	as	the	Black	Priest	on	account	of	his	dark	face	and	swarthy eyebrows.	He	was	buried	with	a	stake	through	his	heart.’	“</p>
<p class="calibre1">Le	Bihan	paused,	hesitated,	looked	at	me,	and	handed	the	manuscript	back	to Durand.	The	gendarme	took	it	and	slipped	it	into	the	brass	cylinder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,”	said	I,	“the	thirty-ninth	skull	is	the	skull	of	the	Black	Priest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	said	Fortin.	“I	hope	they	won’t	find	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	forbidden	them	to	proceed,”	said	the	mayor	querulously.	“You	heard	me, Max	Fortin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rose	and	picked	up	my	gun.	Môme	came	and	pushed	his	head	into	my	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>“That’s	a	fine	dog,”	observed	Durand,	also	rising. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	don’t	you	wish	to	find	his	skull?”	I	asked	Le	Bihan.	“It	would	be	curious to	see	whether	the	arrow	brand	really	burned	into	the	bone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	is	something	in	that	scroll	that	I	didn’t	read	to	you,”	said	the	mayor grimly.	“Do	you	wish	to	know	what	it	is?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course,”	I	replied	in	surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Give	me	the	scroll	again,	Durand,”	he	said;	then	he	read	from	the	bottom:</p>
<p class="calibre1">”	‘I,	l’Abbé	Sorgue,	forced	to	write	the	above	by	my	executioners,	have	written it	in	my	own	blood;	and	with	it	I	leave	my	curse.	My	curse	on	St.	Gildas,	on Marie	Trevec,	and	on	her	descendants.	I	will	come	back	to	St.	Gildas	when	my remains	are	disturbed.	Woe	to	that	Englishman	whom	my	branded	skull	shall touch!’	“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	rot!”	I	said.	“Do	you	believe	it	was	really	written	in	his	own	blood?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	going	to	test	it,”	said	Fortin,	“at	the	request	of	Monsieur	le	Maire.	I	am	not anxious	for	the	job,	however.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See,”	said	Le	Bihan,	holding	out	the	scroll	to	me,	“it	is	signed,	‘l’Abbé	Sorgue.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	glanced	curiously	over	the	paper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	must	be	the	Black	Priest,”	I	said.	“He	was	the	only	man	who	wrote	in	the Breton	language.	This	is	a	wonderfully	interesting	discovery,	for	now,	at	last,	the mystery	of	the	Black	Priest’s	disappearance	is	cleared	up.	You	will,	of	course, send	this	scroll	to	Paris,	Le	Bihan?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	said	the	mayor	obstinately,	“it	shall	be	buried	in	the	pit	below	where	the rest	of	the	Black	Priest	lies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	him	and	recognised	that	argument	would	be	useless.	But	still	I	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	will	be	a	loss	to	history,	Monsieur	Le	Bihan.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘All	the	worse	for	history,	then,”	said	the	enlightened	mayor	of	St.	Gildas. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>We	had	sauntered	back	to	the	gravel	pit	while	speaking.	The	men	of	Bannalec were	carrying	the	bones	of	the	English	soldiers	toward	the	St.	Gildas	cemetery, on	the	cliffs	to	the	east,	where	already	a	knot	of	white-coiffed	women	stood	in attitudes	of	prayer;	and	I	saw	the	sombre	robe	of	a	priest	among	the	crosses	of the	little	graveyard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	were	thieves	and	assassins;	they	are	dead	now,”	muttered	Max	Fortin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Respect	the	dead,”	repeated	the	Mayor	of	St.	Gildas,	looking	after	the	Bannalec men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	written	in	that	scroll	that	Marie	Trevec,	of	Groix	Island,	was	cursed	by the	priest—she	and	her	descendants,”	I	said,	touching	Le	Bihan	on	the	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	was	a	Marie	Trevec	who	married	an	Yves	Trevec	of	St.	Gildas—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	the	same,”	said	Le	Bihan,	looking	at	me	obliquely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh!”	said	I;	“then	they	were	ancestors	of	my	wife.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	fear	the	curse?”	asked	Le	Bihan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	I	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	was	the	case	of	the	Purple	Emperor,”	said	Max	Fortin	timidly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Startled	for	a	moment,	I	faced	him,	then	shrugged	my	shoulders	and	kicked	at	a smooth	bit	of	rock	which	lay	near	the	edge	of	the	pit,	almost	embedded	in gravel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	suppose	the	Purple	Emperor	drank	himself	crazy	because	he	was descended	from	Marie	Trevec?”	I	asked	contemptuously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	not,”	said	Max	Fortin	hastily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	not,”	piped	the	mayor.	“I	only—	Hello!	what’s	that	you’re	kicking?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	said	I,	glancing	down,	at	the	same	time	involuntarily	giving	another kick.	The	smooth	bit	of	rock	dislodged	itself	and	rolled	out	of	the	loosened gravel	at	my	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>“The	thirty-ninth	skull!”	I	exclaimed.	“By	jingo,	it’s	the	noddle	of	the	Black Priest!	See!	there	is	the	arrowhead	branded	on	the	front!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	mayor	stepped	back.	Max	Fortin	also	retreated.	There	was	a	pause,	during which	I	looked	at	them,	and	they	looked	anywhere	but	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	like	it,”	said	the	mayor	at	last,	in	a	husky,	high	voice.	“I	don’t	like	it! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	scroll	says	he	will	come	back	to	St.	Gildas	when	his	remains	are	disturbed.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">—I	don’t	like	it,	Monsieur	Darrel—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bosh!”	said	I;	“the	poor	wicked	devil	is	where	he	can’t	get	out.	For	Heaven’s sake,	Le	Bihan,	what	is	this	stuff	you	are	talking	in	the	year	of	grace	1896?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	mayor	gave	me	a	look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	he	says	‘Englishman.’	You	are	an	Englishman,	Monsieur	Darrel,”	he announced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	better.	You	know	I’m	an	American.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	all	the	same,”	said	the	Mayor	of	St.	Gildas,	obstinately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	it	isn’t!”	I	answered,	much	exasperated,	and	deliberately	pushed	the	skull till	it	rolled	into	the	bottom	of	the	gravel	pit	below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cover	it	up,”	said	I;	“bury	the	scroll	with	it	too,	if	you	insist,	but	I	think	you ought	to	send	it	to	Paris.	Don’t	look	so	gloomy,	Fortin,	unless	you	believe	in were-wolves	and	ghosts.	Hey!	what	the—what	the	devil’s	the	matter	with	you, anyway?	What	are	you	staring	at,	Le	Bihan?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come,	come,”	muttered	the	mayor	in	a	low,	tremulous	voice,	“it’s	time	we	got out	of	this.	Did	you	see?	Did	you	see,	Fortin?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	saw,”	whispered	Max	Fortin,	pallid	with	fright. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	two	men	were	almost	running	across	the	sunny	pasture	now,	and	I	hastened after	them,	demanding	to	know	what	was	the	matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Matter!”	chattered	the	mayor,	gasping	with	exasperation	and	terror.	“The	skull is	rolling	uphill	again!”	and	he	burst	into	a	terrified	gallop.	Max	Fortin	followed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>close	behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	watched	them	stampeding	across	the	pasture,	then	turned	toward	the	gravel	pit, mystified,	incredulous.	The	skull	was	lying	on	the	edge	of	the	pit,	exactly	where it	had	been	before	I	pushed	it	over	the	edge.	For	a	second	I	stared	at	it;	a	singular chilly	feeling	crept	up	my	spinal	column,	and	I	turned	and	walked	away,	swear starting	from	the	root	of	every	hair	on	my	head.	Before	I	had	gone	twenty	paces the	absurdity	of	the	whole	thing	struck	me.	I	halted,	hot	with	shame	and annoyance,	and	retraced	my	steps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	lay	the	skull. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	rolled	a	stone	down	instead	of	the	skull,”	I	muttered	to	myself.	Then	with	the butt	of	my	gun	I	pushed	the	skull	over	the	edge	of	the	pit	and	watched	it	roll	to the	bottom;	and	as	it	struck	the	bottom	of	the	pit,	Môme,	my	dog,	suddenly whipped	his	tail	between	his	legs,	whimpered,	and	made	off	across	the	moor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Môme!”	I	shouted,	angry	and	astonished;	but	the	dog	only	fled	the	faster,	and	I ceased	calling	from	sheer	surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	the	mischief	is	the	matter	with	that	dog!”	I	thought.	He	had	never	before played	me	such	a	trick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mechanically	I	glanced	into	the	pit,	but	I	could	not	see	the	skull.	I	looked	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	skull	lay	at	my	feet	again,	touching	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	heavens!”	I	stammered,	and	struck	at	it	blindly	with	my	gunstock.	The ghastly	thing	flew	into	the	air,	whirling	over	and	over,	and	rolled	again	down	the sides	of	the	pit	to	the	bottom.	Breathlessly	I	stared	at	it,	then,	confused	and scarcely	comprehending,	I	stepped	back	from	the	pit,	still	facing	it,	one,	ten, twenty	paces,	my	eyes	almost	starting	from	my	head,	as	though	I	expected	to	see the	thing	roll	up	from	the	bottom	of	the	pit	under	my	very	gaze.	At	last	I	turned my	back	to	the	pit	and	strode	out	across	the	gorse-covered	moorland	toward	my home.	As	I	reached	the	road	that	winds	from	St.	Gildas	to	St.	Julien	I	gave	one last	hasty	glance	at	the	pit	over	my	shoulder.	The	sun	shone	hot	on	the	sod	about the	excavation.	There	was	something	white	and	bare	and	round	on	the	turf	at	the edge	of	the	pit.	It	might	have	been	a	stone;	there	were	plenty	of	them	lying about. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a><b class="calibre4">II</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	entered	my	garden	I	saw	Môme	sprawling	on	the	stone	doorstep.	He eyed	me	sideways	and	flopped	his	tail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	not	mortified,	you	idiot	dog?”	I	said,	looking	about	the	upper	windows for	Lys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Môme	rolled	over	on	his	back	and	raised	one	deprecating	forepaw,	as	though	to ward	off	calamity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	act	as	though	I	was	in	the	habit	of	beating	you	to	death,”	I	said, disgusted.	I	had	never	in	my	life	raised	whip	to	the	brute.	“But	you	are	a	fool dog,”	I	continued.	“No,	you	needn’t	come	to	be	babied	and	wept	over;	Lys	can do	that,	if	she	insists,	but	I	am	ashamed	of	you,	and	you	can	go	the	devil.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Môme	slunk	off	into	the	house,	and	I	followed,	mounting	directly	to	my	wife’s boudoir.	It	was	empty.	“Where	has	she	gone?”	I	said,	looking	hard	at	Môme, who	had	followed	me.	“Oh!	I	see	you	don’t	know.	Don’t	pretend	you	do.	Come off	that	lounge!	Do	you	think	Lys	wants	ran-coloured	hairs	all	over	her	lounge?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rang	the	bell	for	Catherine	and	‘Fine,	but	they	didn’t	know	where	“madame” </p>
<p class="calibre1">had	gone;	so	I	went	into	my	room,	bathed,	exchanged	my	somewhat	grimy shooting	clothes	for	a	suit	of	warm,	soft	knickerbockers,	and,	after	lingering some	extra	moments	over	my	toilet—for	I	was	particular,	now	that	I	had	married Lys—I	went	down	to	the	garden	and	took	a	chair	out	under	the	fig-trees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	can	she	be?”	I	wondered.	Môme	came	sneaking	out	to	be	comforted, and	I	forgave	him	for	Lys’s	sake,	whereupon	he	frisked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	bounding	cur,”	said	I,	“now	what	on	earth	started	you	off	across	the	moor? </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	you	do	it	again	I’ll	push	you	along	with	a	charge	of	dust	shot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	yet	I	had	scarcely	dared	think	about	the	ghastly	hallucination	of	which	I	had been	a	victim,	but	now	I	faced	it	squarely,	flushing	a	little	with	mortification	at the	thought	of	my	hasty	retreat	from	the	gravel	pit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To	think,”	I	said	aloud,	“that	those	old	woman’s	tales	of	Max	Fortin	and	Le</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>Bihan	should	have	actually	made	me	see	what	didn’t	exist	at	all!	I	lost	my	nerve like	a	schoolboy	in	a	dark	bedroom.”	For	I	knew	now	that	I	had	mistaken	a round	stone	for	a	skull	each	time,	and	had	pushed	a	couple	of	big	pebbles	into the	pit	instead	of	the	skull	itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	jingo!”	said	I,	“I’m	nervous;	my	liver	must	be	in	a	devil	of	a	condition	if	I see	such	things	when	I’m	awake!	Lys	will	know	what	to	give	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	felt	mortified	and	irritated	and	sulky,	and	thought	disgustedly	of	Le	Bihan	and Max	Fortin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	after	a	while	I	ceased	speculating,	dismissed	the	mayor,	the	chemist,	and	the skull	from	my	mind,	and	smoked	pensively,	watching	the	sun	low	dipping	in	the western	ocean.	As	the	twilight	fell	for	a	moment	over	ocean	and	moorland,	a wistful,	restless	happiness	filled	my	heart,	the	happiness	that	all	men	know—all men	who	have	loved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowly	the	purple	mist	crept	out	over	the	sea;	the	cliffs	darkened;	the	forest	was shrouded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly	the	sky	above	burned	with	the	afterglow,	and	the	world	was	alight again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cloud	after	cloud	caught	the	rose	dye;	the	cliffs	were	tinted	with	it;	moor	and pasture,	heather	and	forest	burned	and	pulsated	with	the	gentle	flush.	I	saw	the gulls	turning	and	tossing	above	the	sand	bar,	their	snowy	wings	tipped	with	pink; I	saw	the	sea	swallows	sheeting	the	surface	of	the	still	river,	stained	to	its	placid depths	with	warm	reflections	of	the	clouds.	The	twitter	of	drowsy	hedge	birds broke	out	in	the	stillness;	a	salmon	rolled	its	shining	side	above	tide-water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	interminable	monotone	of	the	ocean	intensified	the	silence.	I	sat	motionless, holding	my	breath	as	one	who	listens	to	the	first	low	rumour	of	an	organ.	All	at once	the	pure	whistle	of	a	nightingale	cut	the	silence,	and	the	first	moonbeam silvered	the	wastes	of	mist-hung	waters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	raised	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lys	stood	before	me	in	the	garden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	we	had	kissed	each	other,	we	linked	arms	and	moved	up	and	down	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>gravel	walks,	watching	the	moonbeams	sparkle	on	the	sand	bar	as	the	tide	ebbed and	ebbed.	The	broad	beds	of	white	pinks	about	us	were	atremble	with	hovering white	moths;	the	October	roses	hung	all	abloom,	perfuming	the	salt	wind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sweetheart,”	I	said,	“where	is	Yvonne?	Has	she	promised	to	spend	Christmas with	us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	Dick;	she	drove	me	down	from	Plougar	this	afternoon.	She	sent	her	love	to you.	I	am	not	jealous.	What	did	you	shoot?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	hare	and	four	partridges.	They	are	in	the	gun	room.	I	told	Catherine	not	to touch	them	until	you	had	seen	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	I	suppose	I	knew	that	Lys	could	not	be	particularly	enthusiastic	over	game or	guns;	but	she	pretended	she	was,	and	always	scornfully	denied	that	it	was	for my	sake	and	not	for	the	pure	love	of	sport.	So	she	dragged	me	off	to	inspect	the rather	meagre	game	bag,	and	she	paid	me	pretty	compliments	and	gave	a	little cry	of	delight	and	pity	as	I	lifted	the	enormous	hare	out	of	the	sack	by	his	ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’ll	eat	no	more	of	our	lettuce,”	I	said,	attempting	to	justify	the	assassination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Unhappy	little	bunny—and	what	a	beauty!	O	Dick,	you	are	a	splendid	shot,	are you	not?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	evaded	the	question	and	hauled	out	a	partridge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Poor	little	dead	things!”	said	Lys	in	a	whisper;	“it	seems	a	pity—doesn’t	it, Dick?	But	then	you	are	so	clever—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	have	them	broiled,”	I	said	guardedly;	“tell	Catherine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Catherine	came	in	to	take	away	the	game,	and	presently	‘Fine	Lelocard,	Lys’s maid,	announced	dinner,	and	Lys	tripped	away	to	her	boudoir. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stood	an	instant	contemplating	her	blissfully,	thinking,	“My	boy,	you’re	the happiest	fellow	in	the	world—you’re	in	love	with	your	wife!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	walked	into	the	dining	room,	beamed	at	the	plates,	walked	out	again;	met Tregunc	in	the	hallway,	beamed	on	him;	glanced	into	the	kitchen,	beamed	at Catherine,	and	went	up	stairs,	still	beaming. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>Before	I	could	knock	at	Lys’s	door	it	opened,	and	Lys	came	hastily	out.	When she	saw	me	she	gave	a	little	cry	of	relief,	and	nestled	close	to	my	breast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	is	something	peering	in	at	my	window,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What!”	I	cried	angrily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘A	man,	I	think,	disguised	as	a	priest,	and	he	has	a	mask	on.	He	must	have climbed	up	by	the	bay	tree.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	down	the	stairs	and	out	of	doors	in	no	time.	The	moonlit	garden	was absolutely	deserted.	Tregunc	came	up,	and	together	we	searched	the	hedge	and shrubbery	around	the	house	and	out	to	the	road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jean	Marie,”	said	I	at	length,	“loose	my	bulldog—he	knows	you—and	take your	supper	on	the	porch	where	you	can	watch.	My	wife	says	the	fellow	is disguised	as	a	priest,	and	wears	a	mask.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tregunc	showed	his	white	teeth	in	a	smile.	“He	will	not	care	to	venture	in	here again,	I	think,	Monsieur	Darrel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	back	and	found	Lys	seated	quietly	at	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	soup	is	ready,	dear,”	she	said.	“Don’t	worry;	it	was	only	some	foolish	lout from	Bannalec.	No	one	in	St.	Gildas	or	St.	Julien	would	do	such	a	thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	too	much	exasperated	to	reply	at	first,	but	Lys	treated	it	as	a	stupid	joke, and	after	a	while	I	began	to	look	at	it	in	that	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lys	told	me	about	Yvonne,	and	reminded	me	of	my	promise	to	have	Herbert Stuart	down	to	meet	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	wicked	diplomat!”	I	protested.	“Herbert	is	in	Paris,	and	hard	at	work	for the	Salon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	you	think	he	might	spare	a	week	to	flirt	with	the	prettiest	girl	in Finistère?”	inquired	Lys	innocently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Prettiest	girl!	Not	much!”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>“Who	is,	then?”	urged	Lys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	laughed	a	trifle	sheepishly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	suppose	you	mean	me,	Dick,”	said	Lys,	colouring	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	I	bore	you,	don’t	I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bore	me?	Ah,	no,	Dick.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	coffee	and	cigarettes	were	served	I	spoke	about	Tregunc,	and	Lys approved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Poor	Jean!	he	will	be	glad,	won’t	he?	What	a	dear	fellow	you	are!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nonsense,”	said	I;	“we	need	a	gardener;	you	said	so	yourself,	Lys.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Lys	leaned	over	and	kissed	me,	and	then	bent	down	and	hugged	Môme,	who whistled	through	his	nose	in	sentimental	appreciation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	a	very	happy	woman,”	said	Lys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Môme	was	a	very	bad	dog	to-day,”	I	observed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Poor	Môme!”	said	Lys,	smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	dinner	was	over	and	Môme	lay	snoring	before	the	blaze—for	the	October nights	are	often	chilly	in	Finistère—Lys	curled	up	in	the	chimney	corner	with her	embroidery,	and	gave	me	a	swift	glance	from	under	her	drooping	lashes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	look	like	a	schoolgirl,	Lys,”	I	said	teasingly.	“I	don’t	believe	you	are sixteen	yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	pushed	back	her	heavy	burnished	hair	thoughtfully.	Her	wrist	was	as	white as	surf	foam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have	we	been	married	four	years?	I	don’t	believe	it,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	gave	me	another	swift	glance	and	touched	the	embroidery	on	her	knee, smiling	faintly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>“I	see,”	said	I,	also	smiling	at	the	embroidered	garment.	“Do	you	think	it	will fit?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fit?”	repeated	Lys.	Then	she	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And,”	I	persisted,	“are	you	perfectly	sure	that	you—er—we	shall	need	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perfectly,”	said	Lys.	A	delicate	colour	touched	her	cheeks	and	neck.	She	held up	the	little	garment,	all	fluffy	with	misty	lace	and	wrought	with	quaint embroidery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	very	gorgeous.”	said	I;	“don’t	use	your	eyes	too	much,	dearest.	May	I smoke	a	pipe?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course,”	she	said,	selecting	a	skein	of	pale	blue	silk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	while	I	sat	and	smoked	in	silence,	watching	her	slender	fingers	among	the tinted	silks	and	thread	of	gold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Presently	she	spoke:	“What	did	you	say	your	crest	is,	Dick?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	crest?	Oh,	something	or	other	rampant	on	a	something	or	other—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dick!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dearest?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	be	flippant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	really	forget.	It’s	an	ordinary	crest;	everybody	in	New	York	has	them.	No family	should	be	without	‘em.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	are	disagreeable,	Dick.	Send	Josephine	upstairs	for	my	album.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Are	you	going	to	put	that	crest	on	the—the—whatever	it	is?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am;	and	my	own	crest,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	of	the	Purple	Emperor	and	wondered	a	little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	didn’t	know	I	had	one,	did	you?”	she	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>“What	is	it?”	I	replied	evasively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	shall	see.	Ring	for	Josephine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rang,	and,	when	‘Fine	appeared,	Lys	gave	her	some	orders	in	a	low	voice,	and Josephine	trotted	away,	bobbing	her	white-coiffed	head	with	a	“Bien,	madame!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	few	minutes	she	returned,	bearing	a	tattered,	musty	volume,	from	which the	gold	and	blue	had	mostly	disappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	the	book	in	my	hands	and	examined	the	ancient	emblazoned	covers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lilies!”	I	exclaimed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fleur-de-lis,”	said	my	wife	demurely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh!”	said	I,	astonished,	and	opened	the	book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	have	never	before	seen	this	book?”	asked	Lys,	with	a	touch	of	malice	in her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	I	haven’t.	Hello!	what’s	this?	Oho!	So	there	should	be	a	de	before Trevec?	Lys	de	Trevec?	Then	why	in	the	world	did	the	Purple	Emperor—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dick!”	cried	Lys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘All	right,”	said	I.	“Shall	I	read	about	the	Sieur	de	Trevec	who	rode	to	Saladin’s tent	alone	to	seek	for	medicine	for	Sr.	Louis?	or	shall	I	read	about—what	is	it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh,	here	it	is,	all	down	in	black	and	white—about	the	Marquis	de	Trevec	who drowned	himself	before	Alva’s	eyes	rather	than	surrender	the	banner	of	the	fleur-de-lis	to	Spain?	It’s	all	written	here.	But,	dear,	how	about	that	soldier	named Trevec	who	was	killed	in	the	old	fort	on	the	cliff	yonder?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	dropped	the	de,	and	the	Trevecs	since	then	have	been	Republicans,”	said Lys—“all	except	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	quite	right,”	said	I;	“it	is	time	that	we	Republicans	should	agree	upon some	feudal	system.	My	dear,	I	drink	to	the	king!”	and	I	raised	my	wine-glass and	looked	at	Lys. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>“To	the	king,”	said	Lys,	flushing.	She	smoothed	out	the	tiny	garment	on	her knees;	she	touched	the	glass	with	her	lips;	her	eyes	were	very	sweet.	I	drained the	glass	to	the	king. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	silence	I	said:	“I	will	tell	the	king	stories.	His	Majesty	shall	be	amused.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“His	Majesty,”	repeated	Lys	softly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or	hers,”	I	laughed.	“Who	knows?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	knows?”	murmured	Lys,	with	a	gentle	sigh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	some	stores	about	Jack	the	Giant-Killer,”	I	announced.	“Do	you,	Lys?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I?	No,	not	about	a	giant-killer,	but	I	know	all	about	the	were-wolf,	and	Jeanne-la-Flamme,	and	the	Man	in	Purple	Tatters,	and—O	dear	me!	I	know	lots	more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	are	very	wise,”	said	I.	“I	shall	reach	his	Majesty	English.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	I	Breton,”	cried	Lys	jealously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	shall	bring	playthings	to	the	king,”	said	I—“big	green	lizards	from	the	gorse, little	gray	mullets	to	swim	in	glass	globes,	baby	rabbits	from	the	forest	of Kerselec—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	I,”	said	Lys,	“will	bring	the	first	primrose,	the	first	branch	of	aubepine,	the first	jonquil,	to	the	king—my	king.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our	king,”	said	I;	and	there	was	peace	in	Finistère. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	lay	back,	idly	turning	the	leaves	of	the	curious	old	volume. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	looking,”	said	I,	“for	the	crest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	crest,	dear?	It	is	a	priest’s	head	with	an	arrow-shaped	mark	on	the	forehead, on	a	field—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	up	and	stared	at	my	wife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dick,	whatever	is	the	matter?”	she	smiled.	“The	story	is	there	in	that	book.	Do you	care	to	read	it?	No?	Shall	I	tell	it	to	you?	Well,	then:	It	happened	in	the	third</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>crusade.	There	was	a	monk	whom	men	called	the	Black	Priest.	He	turned apostate,	and	sold	himself	to	the	enemies	of	Christ.	A	Sieur	de	Trevec	burst	into the	Saracen	camp,	at	the	head	of	only	one	hundred	lances,	and	carried	the	Black Priest	away	out	of	the	very	midst	of	their	army.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	that	is	how	you	come	by	the	crest,”	I	said	quietly;	but	I	thought	of	the branded	skull	in	the	gravel	pit,	and	wondered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	said	Lys.	“The	Sieur	de	Trevec	cut	the	Black	Priest’s	head	off,	but	first	he branded	him	with	an	arrow	mark	on	the	forehead.	The	book	says	it	was	a	pious action,	and	that	the	Sieur	de	Trevec	got	great	merit	by	it.	But	I	think	it	was	cruel, the	branding,”	she	sighed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	ever	hear	of	any	other	Black	Priest?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	There	was	one	in	the	last	century,	here	in	St.	Gildas.	He	cast	a	white shadow	in	the	sun.	He	wrote	in	the	Breton	language.	Chronicles,	too,	I	believe.	I never	saw	them.	His	name	was	the	same	as	that	of	the	old	chronicler,	and	of	the other	priest,	Jacques	Sorgue.	Some	said	he	was	a	lineal	descendant	of	the	traitor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	course	the	first	Black	Priest	was	bad	enough	for	anything.	But	if	he	did	have a	child,	it	need	not	have	been	the	ancestor	of	the	last	Jacques	Sorgue.	They	say this	one	was	a	holy	man.	They	say	he	was	so	good	he	was	not	allowed	to	die,	but was	caught	up	to	heaven	one	day,”	added	Lys,	with	believing	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	he	disappeared,”	persisted	Lys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	afraid	his	journey	was	in	another	direction,”	I	said	jestingly,	and thoughtlessly	told	her	the	story	of	the	morning.	I	had	utterly	forgotten	the masked	man	at	her	window,	but	before	I	finished	I	remembered	him	fast	enough, and	realized	what	I	had	done	as	I	saw	her	face	whiten. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lys,”	I	urged	tenderly,	“that	was	only	some	clumsy	clown’s	trick.	You	said	so yourself.	You	are	not	superstitious,	my	dear?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	eyes	were	on	mine.	She	slowly	drew	the	little	gold	cross	from	her	bosom and	kissed	it.	But	her	lips	trembled	as	they	pressed	the	symbol	of	faith. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a><b class="calibre4">III</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">About	nine	o’clock	the	next	morning	I	walked	into	the	Groix	Inn	and	sat	down	at the	long	discoloured	oaken	table,	nodding	good-day	to	Marianne	Bruyère,	who in	turn	bobbed	her	white	coiffe	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	clever	Bannalec	maid,”	said	I,	“what	is	good	for	a	stirrup-cup	at	the	Groix Inn?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Schist?”	she	inquired	in	Breton. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With	a	dash	of	red	wine,	then,”	I	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	brought	the	delicious	Quimperlé	cider,	and	I	poured	a	little	Bordeaux	into	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marianne	watched	me	with	laughing	black	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	makes	your	cheeks	so	red,	Marianne?”	I	asked.	“Has	Jean	Marie	been here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	are	to	be	married,	Monsieur	Darrel,”	she	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah!	Since	when	has	Jean	Marie	Tregunc	lost	his	head?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“His	head?	Oh,	Monsieur	Darrel—his	heart,	you	mean!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	I	do,”	said	I.	“Jean	Marie	is	a	practical	fellow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	all	due	to	your	kindness—”	began	the	girl,	but	I	raised	my	hand	and	held up	the	glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	due	to	himself.	To	your	happiness,	Marianne,”	and	I	took	a	hearty	draught of	the	schist.	“Now,”	said	I,	“tell	me	where	I	can	find	Le	Bihan	and	Max	Fortin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Monsieur	Le	Bihan	and	Monsieur	Fortin	are	above	in	the	broad	room.	I	believe they	are	examining	the	Red	Admiral’s	effects.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To	send	them	to	Paris?	Oh,	I	know.	May	I	go	up,	Marianne?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	God	go	with	you,”	smiled	the	girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>When	I	knocked	at	the	door	of	the	broad	room	above	little	Max	Fortin	opened	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dust	covered	his	spectacles	and	nose;	his	hat,	with	the	tiny	velvet	ribbons fluttering,	was	all	awry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	in,	Monsieur	Darrel,”	he	said;	“the	mayor	and	I	are	packing	up	the effects	of	the	Purple	Emperor	and	of	the	poor	Red	Admiral.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	collections?”	I	asked,	entering	the	room.	“You	must	be	very	careful	in packing	those	butterfly	cases;	the	slightest	jar	might	break	wings	and	antennae, you	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Le	Bihan	shook	hands	with	me	and	pointed	to	the	great	pile	of	boxes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	all	cork	lined,”	he	said,	“but	Fortin	and	I	are	putting	felt	around	each box.	The	Entomological	Society	of	Paris	pays	the	freight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	combined	collections	of	the	Red	Admiral	and	the	Purple	Emperor	made	a magnificent	display. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	lifted	and	inspected	case	after	case	set	with	gorgeous	butterflies	and	moths, each	specimen	carefully	labelled	with	the	name	in	Latin.	There	were	cases	filled with	crimson	tiger	moths	all	aflame	with	colour;	cases	devoted	to	the	common yellow	butterflies;	symphonies	in	orange	and	pale	yellow;	cases	of	soft	gray	and dun-coloured	sphinx	moths;	and	cases	of	garish	nettle-bred	butterflies	of	the numerous	family	of	Vanessa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	alone	in	a	great	case	by	itself	was	pinned	the	purple	emperor,	the	Apatura Iris,	that	fatal	specimen	that	had	given	the	Purple	Emperor	his	name	and	quietus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	remembered	the	butterfly,	and	stood	looking	at	it	with	bent	eyebrows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Le	Bihan	glanced	up	from	the	floor	where	he	was	nailing	down	the	lid	of	a	box full	of	cases. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	settled,	then,”	said	he,	“that	madame,	your	wife,	gives	the	Purple Emperor’s	entire	collection	to	the	city	of	Paris?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Without	accepting	anything	for	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>“It	is	a	gift,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Including	the	purple	emperor	there	in	the	case?	That	butterfly	is	worth	a	great deal	of	money,”	persisted	Le	Bihan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	suppose	that	we	would	wish	to	sell	that	specimen,	do	you?”	I answered	a	trifle	sharply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	I	were	you	I	should	destroy	it,”	said	the	mayor	in	his	high-pitched	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	would	be	nonsense,”	said	I—“like	your	burying	the	brass	cylinder	and scroll	yesterday.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	not	nonsense,”	said	Le	Bihan	doggedly,	“and	I	should	prefer	not	to discuss	the	subject	of	the	scroll.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	Max	Fortin,	who	immediately	avoided	my	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	are	a	pair	of	superstitious	old	women,”	said	I,	digging	my	hands	into	my pockets;	“you	swallow	every	nursery	tale	that	is	invented.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	of	it?”	said	Le	Bihan	sulkily;	“there’s	more	truth	than	lies	in	most	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘em.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh!”	I	sneered,	“does	the	Mayor	of	St.	Gildas	and	Sr.	Julien	believe	in	the Loup-garou?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	not	in	the	Loup-garou.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	what,	then—Jeanne-la-Flamme?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That,”	said	Le	Bihan	with	conviction,	“is	history.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	devil	it	is!”	said	I;	“and	perhaps,	monsieur	the	mayor,	your	faith	in	giants	is unimpaired?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	were	giants—everybody	knows	it,”	growled	Max	Fortin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you	a	chemist!”	I	observed	scornfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen,	Monsieur	Darrel,”	squeaked	Le	Bihan;	“you	know	yourself	that	the Purple	Emperor	was	a	scientific	man.	Now	suppose	I	should	tell	you	that	he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>always	refused	to	include	in	his	collection	a	Death’s	Messenger?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	what?”	I	exclaimed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	what	I	mean—that	moth	that	flies	by	night;	some	call	it	the	Death’s Head,	but	in	St.	Gildas	we	call	it	‘Death’s	Messenger.’	“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh!”	said	I,	“you	mean	that	big	sphinx	moth	that	is	commonly	known	as	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘death’s-head	moth.’	Why	the	mischief	should	the	people	here	call	it	death’s messenger?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	hundreds	of	years	it	has	been	known	as	death’s	messenger	in	St.	Gildas,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said	Max	Fortin.	“Even	Froissart	speaks	of	it	in	his	commentaries	on	Jacques Sorgue’s	Chronicles.	The	book	is	in	your	library.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorgue?	And	who	was	Jacques	Sorgue?	I	never	read	his	book.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jacques	Sorgue	was	the	son	of	some	unfrocked	priest—I	forget.	It	was	during the	crusades.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	Heavens!”	I	burst	our,	“I’ve	been	hearing	of	nothing	but	crusades	and priests	and	death	and	sorcery	ever	since	I	kicked	that	skull	into	the	gravel	pit, and	I	am	tired	of	it,	I	tell	you	frankly.	One	would	think	we	lived	in	the	dark	ages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Do	you	know	what	year	of	our	Lord	it	is,	Le	Bihan?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eighteen	hundred	and	ninety-six,”	replied	the	mayor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	yet	you	two	hulking	men	are	afraid	of	a	death’s-head	moth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	care	to	have	one	fly	into	the	window,”	said	Max	Fortin;	“it	means	evil	to the	house	and	the	people	in	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“God	alone	knows	why	he	marked	one	of	his	creatures	with	a	yellow	death’s head	on	the	back.”	observed	Le	Bihan	piously,	“but	I	take	it	that	he	meant	it	as	a warning;	and	I	propose	to	profit	by	it,”	he	added	triumphantly</p>
<p class="calibre1">“See	here,	Le	Bihan,”	I	said;	“by	a	stretch	of	imagination	one	can	make	out	a skull	on	the	thorax	of	a	certain	big	sphinx	moth.	What	of	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	a	bad	thing	to	touch,”	said	the	mayor,	wagging	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>“It	squeaks	when	handled,”	added	Max	Fortin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some	creatures	squeak	all	the	time,”	I	observed,	looking	hard	at	Le	Bihan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pigs,”	added	the	mayor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	and	asses,”	I	replied.	“Listen,	Le	Bihan:	do	you	mean	to	tell	me	that	you saw	that	skull	roll	uphill	yesterday?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	mayor	shut	his	mouth	tightly	and	picked	up	his	hammer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	be	obstinate,”	I	said;	“I	asked	you	a	question.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	I	refuse	to	answer,”	snapped	Le	Bihan.	“Fortin	saw	what	I	saw;	let	him talk	about	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	searchingly	at	the	little	chemist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	say	that	I	saw	it	actually	roll	up	out	of	the	pit,	all	by	itself,’	said	Fortin with	a	shiver,	“but—but	then,	how	did	it	come	up	out	of	the	pit	if	it	didn’t	roll	up all	by	itself?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	didn’t	come	up	at	all;	that	was	a	yellow	cobblestone	that	you	mistook	for	the skull	again,”	I	replied.	“You	were	nervous,	Max.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A—a	very	curious	cobblestone,	Monsieur	Darrel,”	said	Fortin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	also	was	a	victim	to	the	same	hallucination,”	I	continued,	“and	regret	to	say that	I	took	the	trouble	to	roll	two	innocent	cobblestones	into	the	gravel	pit, imagining	each	time	that	it	was	the	skull	I	was	rolling.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was,”	observed	Le	Bihan	with	a	morose	shrug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	just	shows,”	said	I,	ignoring	the	mayor’s	remark,	“how	easy	it	is	to	fix	up	a train	of	coincidences	so	that	the	result	seems	to	savour	of	the	supernatural.	Now, last	night	my	wife	imagined	that	she	saw	a	priest	in	a	mask	peer	in	at	her window—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fortin	and	Le	Bihan	scrambled	hastily	from	their	knees,	dropping	hammer	and nails. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>“W-h-a-t—what’s	that?”	demanded	the	mayor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	repeated	what	I	had	said.	Max	Fortin	turned	livid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	God!”	muttered	Le	Bihan,	“the	Black	Priest	is	in	St.	Gildas!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“D-don’t	you—you	know	the	old	prophecy?”	stammered	Fortin	“Froissart quotes	it	from	Jacques	Sorgue:</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘When	the	Black	Priest	rises	from	the	dead,	St.	Gildas	folk	shall	shriek	in	bed; When	the	Black	Priest	rises	from	his	grave,	May	the	good	God	St.	Gildas	save!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aristide	Le	Bihan,”	I	said	angrily,	“and	you,	Max	Fortin,	I’ve	got	enough	of this	nonsense!	Some	foolish	lout	from	Bannalec	has	been	in	St.	Gildas	playing tricks	to	frighten	old	fools	like	you.	If	you	have	nothing	better	to	talk	about	than nursery	legends	I’ll	wait	until	you	come	to	your	senses.	Good-morning.”	And	I walked	our,	more	disturbed	than	I	cared	to	acknowledge	to	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	day	had	become	misty	and	overcast.	Heavy,	wet	clouds	hung	in	the	east.	I heard	the	surf	thundering	against	the	cliffs,	and	the	gray	gulls	squealed	as	they tossed	and	turned	high	in	the	sky.	The	tide	was	creeping	across	the	river	sands, higher,	higher,	and	I	saw	the	seaweed	floating	on	the	beach,	and	the	lançons springing	from	the	foam,	silvery	threadlike	flashes	in	the	gloom.	Curlew	were flying	up	the	river	in	twos	and	threes;	the	timid	sea	swallows	skimmed	across	the moors	toward	some	quiet,	lonely	pool,	safe	from	the	coming	tempest.	In	every hedge	field	birds	were	gathering,	huddling	together,	twittering	restlessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	reached	the	cliffs	I	sat	down,	resting	my	chin	on	my	clenched	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Already	a	vast	curtain	of	rain,	sweeping	across	the	ocean	miles	away,	hid	the island	of	Groix.	To	the	east,	behind	the	white	semaphore	on	the	hills,	black clouds	crowded	up	over	the	horizon.	After	a	little	the	thunder	boomed,	dull, distant,	and	slender	skeins	of	lightning	unravelled	across	the	crest	of	the	coming storm.	Under	the	cliff	at	my	feet	the	surf	rushed	foaming	over	the	shore,	and	the lançons	jumped	and	skipped	and	quivered	until	they	seemed	to	be	but	the reflections	of	the	meshed	lightning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	to	the	east.	It	was	raining	over	Groix,	it	was	raining	at	Sainte	Barbe,	it was	raining	now	at	the	semaphore.	High	in	the	storm	whirl	a	few	gulls	pitched;	a nearer	cloud	trailed	veils	of	rain	in	its	wake;	the	sky	was	spattered	with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>lightning;	the	thunder	boomed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	rose	to	go,	a	cold	raindrop	fell	upon	the	back	of	my	hand,	and	another,	and yet	another	on	my	face.	I	gave	a	last	glance	at	the	sea,	where	the	waves	were bursting	into	strange	white	shapes	that	seemed	to	fling	out	menacing	arms toward	me.	Then	something	moved	on	the	cliff,	something	black	as	the	black rock	it	clutched—a	filthy	cormorant,	craning	its	hideous	head	at	the	sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowly	I	plodded	homeward	across	the	sombre	moorland,	where	the	gorse	stems glimmered	with	a	dull	metallic	green,	and	the	heather,	no	longer	violet	and purple,	hung	drenched	and	dun-coloured	among	the	dreary	rocks.	The	wet	turf creaked	under	my	heavy	boots,	the	black-thorn	scraped	and	grated	against	knee and	elbow.	Over	all	lay	a	strange	light,	pallid,	ghastly,	where	the	sea	spray whirled	across	the	landscape	and	drove	into	my	face	until	it	grew	numb	with	the cold.	In	broad	bands,	rank	after	rank,	billow	on	billow,	the	rain	burst	out	across the	endless	moors,	and	yet	there	was	no	wind	to	drive	it	at	such	a	pace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lys	stood	at	the	door	as	I	turned	into	the	garden,	motioning	me	to	hasten;	and then	for	the	first	time	I	became	conscious	that	I	was	soaked	to	the	skin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	ever	in	the	world	did	you	come	to	stay	out	when	such	a	storm threatened?”	she	said.	“Oh,	you	are	dripping!	Go	quickly	and	change;	I	have	laid your	warm	underwear	on	the	bed,	Dick.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	kissed	my	wife,	and	went	upstairs	to	change	my	dripping	clothes	for	something more	comfortable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	returned	to	the	morning	room	there	was	a	driftwood	fire	on	the	hearth, and	Lys	sat	in	the	chimney	corner	embroidering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Catherine	tells	me	that	the	fishing	fleet	from	Lorient	is	out.	Do	you	think	they are	in	danger,	dear?”	asked	Lys,	raising	her	blue	eyes	to	mine	as	I	entered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	is	no	wind,	and	there	will	be	no	sea,”	said	I,	looking	out	of	the	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Far	across	the	moor	I	could	see	the	black	cliffs	looming	in	the	mist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	it	rains!”	murmured	Lys;	“come	to	the	fire,	Dick.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	threw	myself	on	the	fur	rug,	my	hands	in	my	pockets,	my	head	on	Lys’s	knees. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>“Tell	me	a	story,”	I	said.	“I	feel	like	a	boy	of	ten.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lys	raised	a	finger	to	her	scarlet	lips.	I	always	waited	for	her	to	do	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will	you	be	very	still,	then?”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Still	as	death.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Death,”	echoed	a	voice,	very	softly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	speak,	Lys?”	I	asked,	turning	so	that	I	could	see	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No;	did	you,	Dick?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	said	‘death’?”	I	asked,	startled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Death,”	echoed	a	voice,	softly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sprang	up	and	looked	about.	Lys	rose	too,	her	needles	and	embroidery	falling	to the	floor.	She	seemed	about	to	faint,	leaning	heavily	on	me,	and	I	led	her	to	the window	and	opened	it	a	little	way	to	give	her	air.	As	I	did	so	the	chain	lightning split	the	zenith,	the	thunder	crashed,	and	a	sheet	of	rain	swept	into	the	room, driving	with	it	something	that	fluttered—something	that	flapped,	and	squeaked, and	beat	upon	the	rug	with	soft,	moist	wings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	bent	over	it	together,	Lys	clinging	to	me,	and	we	saw	that	it	was	a	death’s-head	moth	drenched	with	rain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	dark	day	passed	slowly	as	we	sat	beside	the	fire,	hand	in	hand,	her	head against	my	breast,	speaking	of	sorrow	and	mystery	and	death.	For	Lys	believed that	there	were	things	on	earth	that	none	might	understand,	things	that	must	be nameless	forever	and	ever,	until	God	rolls	up	the	scroll	of	life	and	all	is	ended. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	spoke	of	hope	and	fear	and	faith,	and	the	mystery	of	the	saints;	we	spoke	of the	beginning	and	the	end,	of	the	shadow	of	sin,	of	omens,	and	of	love.	The	moth still	lay	on	the	floor,	quivering	its	sombre	wings	in	the	warmth	of	the	fire,	the skull	and	ribs	clearly	etched	upon	its	neck	and	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	it	is	a	messenger	of	death	to	this	house,”	I	said,	“why	should	we	fear,	Lys?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Death	should	be	welcome	to	those	who	love	God,”	murmured	Lys,	and	she</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>drew	the	cross	from	her	breast	and	kissed	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	moth	might	die	if	I	threw	it	out	into	the	storm,”	I	said	after	a	silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	it	remain,”	sighed	Lys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Late	that	night	my	wife	lay	sleeping,	and	I	sat	beside	her	bed	and	read	in	the Chronicle	of	Jacques	Sorgue.	I	shaded	the	candle,	but	Lys	grew	restless,	and finally	I	took	the	book	down	into	the	morning	room,	where	the	ashes	of	the	fire rustled	and	whitened	on	the	hearth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	death’s-head	moth	lay	on	the	rug	before	the	fire	where	I	had	left	it.	At	first	I thought	it	was	dead,	but,	when	I	looked	closer	I	saw	a	lambent	fire	in	its	amber eyes.	The	straight	white	shadow	it	cast	across	the	floor	wavered	as	the	candle flickered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	pages	of	the	Chronicle	of	Jacques	Sorgue	were	damp	and	sticky;	the illuminated	gold	and	blue	initials	left	flakes	of	azure	and	gilt	where	my	hand brushed	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	not	paper	at	all;	it	is	thin	parchment,”	I	said	to	myself;	and	I	held	the discoloured	page	close	to	the	candle	flame	and	read,	translating	laboriously:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I,	Jacques	Sorgue,	saw	all	these	things.	And	I	saw	the	Black	Mass	celebrated	in the	chapel	of	St.	Gildas-on-the-Cliff.	And	it	was	said	by	the	Abbé	Sorgue,	my kinsman:	for	which	deadly	sin	the	apostate	priest	was	seized	by	the	most	noble Marquis	of	Plougastel	and	by	him	condemned	to	be	burned	with	hot	irons,	until his	seared	soul	quit	its	body	and	fly	to	its	master	the	devil.	But	when	the	Black Priest	lay	in	the	crypt	of	Plougastel,	his	master	Satan	came	at	night	and	set	him free,	and	carried	him	across	land	and	sea	to	Mahmoud,	which	is	Soldan	or Saladin.	And	I,	Jacques	Sorgue,	travelling	afterward	by	sea,	beheld	with	my	own eyes	my	kinsman,	the	Black	Priest	of	St.	Gildas,	borne	along	in	the	air	upon	a vast	black	wing,	which	was	the	wing	of	his	master	Satan.	And	this	was	seen	also by	two	men	of	the	crew.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	the	page.	The	wings	of	the	moth	on	the	floor	began	to	quiver.	I	read	on and	on,	my	eyes	blurring	under	the	shifting	candle	flame.	I	read	of	battles	and	of saints,	and	I	learned	how	the	great	Soldan	made	his	pact	with	Satan,	and	then	I came	to	the	Sieur	de	Trevec,	and	read	how	he	seized	the	Black	Priest	in	the midst	of	Saladin’s	tents	and	carried	him	away	and	cut	off	his	head,	first	branding</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>him	on	the	forehead.	“And	before	he	suffered,”	said	the	Chronicle,	“he	cursed the	Sieur	de	Trevec	and	his	descendants,	and	he	said	he	would	surely	return	to St.	Gildas.	‘For	the	violence	you	do	to	me,	I	will	do	violence	to	you.	For	the	evil I	suffer	at	your	hands,	I	will	work	evil	on	you	and	your	descendants.	Woe	to	your children,	Sieur	de	Trevec!”’	There	was	a	whirr,	a	beating	of	strong	wings,	and my	candle	flashed	up	as	in	a	sudden	breeze.	A	humming	filled	the	room;	the great	moth	darted	hither	and	thither,	beating,	buzzing,	on	ceiling	and	wall.	I flung	down	my	book	and	stepped	forward.	Now	it	lay	fluttering	upon	the window	sill,	and	for	a	moment	I	had	it	under	my	hand,	but	the	thing	squeaked and	I	shrank	back.	Then	suddenly	it	darted	across	the	candle	flame;	the	light flared	and	went	out,	and	at	the	same	moment	a	shadow	moved	in	the	darkness outside.	I	raised	my	eyes	to	the	window.	A	masked	face	was	peering	in	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quick	as	thought	I	whipped	out	my	revolver	and	fired	every	cartridge,	but	the face	advanced	beyond	the	window,	the	glass	melting	away	before	it	like	mist, and	through	the	smoke	of	my	revolver	I	saw	something	creep	swiftly	into	the room.	Then	I	tried	to	cry	our,	but	the	thing	was	at	my	throat,	and	I	fell	backward among	the	ashes	of	the	hearth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">When	my	eyes	unclosed	I	was	lying	on	the	hearth,	my	head	among	the	cold ashes.	Slowly	I	got	on	my	knees,	rose	painfully,	and	groped	my	way	to	a	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	floor	lay	my	revolver,	shining	in	the	pale	light	of	early	morning.	My mind	clearing	by	degrees,	I	looked,	shuddering,	at	the	window.	The	glass	was unbroken.	I	stooped	stiffly,	picked	up	my	revolver	and	opened	the	cylinder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every	cartridge	had	been	fired.	Mechanically	I	closed	the	cylinder	and	placed the	revolver	in	my	pocket.	The	book,	the	Chronicles	of	Jacques	Sorgue,	lay	on the	table	beside	me,	and	as	I	started	to	close	it	I	glanced	at	the	page.	It	was	all splashed	with	rain,	and	the	lettering	had	run,	so	that	the	page	was	merely	a confused	blur	of	gold	and	red	and	black.	As	I	stumbled	toward	the	door	I	cast	a fearful	glance	over	my	shoulder.	The	death’s-head	moth	crawled	shivering	on	the rug. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a><b class="calibre4">IV</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sun	was	about	three	hours	high.	I	must	have	slept,	for	I	was	aroused	by	the sudden	gallop	of	horses	under	our	window.	People	were	shouting	and	calling	in the	road.	I	sprang	up	and	opened	the	sash.	Le	Bihan	was	there,	an	image	of helplessness,	and	Max	Fortin	stood	beside	him,	polishing	his	glasses.	Some gendarmes	had	just	arrived	from	Quimperlé,	and	I	could	hear	them	around	the corner	of	the	house,	stamping,	and	rattling	their	sabres	and	carbines,	as	they	led their	horses	into	my	stable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lys	sat	up,	murmuring	half-sleepy,	half-anxious	questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	I	answered.	“I	am	going	out	to	see	what	it	means.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	like	the	day	they	came	to	arrest	you,”	Lys	said,	giving	me	a	troubled	look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	kissed	her,	and	laughed	at	her	until	she	smiled	too.	Then	I	flung	on	coat and	cap	and	hurried	down	the	stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	first	person	I	saw	standing	in	the	road	was	the	Brigadier	Durand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello!”	said	I,	“have	you	come	to	arrest	me	again?	What	the	devil	is	all	this fuss	about,	anyway?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	were	telegraphed	for	an	hour	ago,”	said	Durand	Briskly,	“and	for	a sufficient	reason,	I	think.	Look	there,	Monsieur	Darrel!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	pointed	to	the	ground	almost	under	my	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	heavens!”	I	cried,	“where	did	that	puddle	of	blood	come	from?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	what	I	want	to	know,	Monsieur	Darrel.	Max	Fortin	found	it	at	daybreak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">See,	it’s	splashed	all	over	the	grass,	too.	A	trail	of	it	leads	into	your	garden, across	the	flower	beds	to	your	very	window,	the	one	that	opens	from	the morning	room.	There	is	another	trail	leading	from	this	spot	across	the	road	to	the cliffs,	then	to	the	gravel	pit,	and	thence	across	the	moor	to	the	forest	of	Kerselec. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	are	going	to	mount	in	a	minute	and	search	the	bosquets.	Will	you	join	us? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bon	Dieu!	but	the	fellow	bled	like	an	ox.	Max	Fortin	says	it’s	human	blood,	or	I should	not	have	believed	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>The	little	chemist	of	Quimperlé	came	up	at	that	moment,	rubbing	his	glasses with	a	coloured	handkerchief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	it	is	human	blood,”	he	said,	“but	one	thing	puzzles	me:	the	corpuscles	are yellow.	I	never	saw	any	human	blood	before	with	yellow	corpuscles.	But	your English	Doctor	Thompson	asserts	that	he	has—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	it’s	human	blood,	anyway—isn’t	it?”	insisted	Durand,	impatiently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ye-es,”	admitted	Max	Fortin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	it’s	my	business	to	trail	it,”	said	the	big	gendarme,	and	he	called	his	men and	gave	the	order	to	mount. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	hear	anything	last	night?”	asked	Durand	of	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	heard	the	rain.	I	wonder	the	rain	did	not	wash	away	these	traces.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	must	have	come	after	the	rain	ceased.	See	this	thick	splash,	how	it	lies over	and	weighs	down	the	wet	grass	blades.	Pah!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	a	heavy,	evil-looking	clot,	and	I	stepped	back	from	it,	my	throat	closing	in disgust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	theory,”	said	the	brigadier,	“is	this:	Some	of	those	Biribi	fishermen, probably	the	Icelanders,	got	an	extra	glass	of	cognac	into	their	hides	and quarrelled	on	the	road.	Some	of	them	were	slashed,	and	staggered	to	your	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	there	is	only	one	trail,	and	yet—and	yet,	how	could	all	that	blood	come	from only	one	person?	Well,	the	wounded	man,	let	us	say,	staggered	first	to	your house	and	then	back	here,	and	he	wandered	off,	drunk	and	dying,	God	knows where.	That’s	my	theory.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘A	very	good	one,”	said	I	calmly.	“And	you	are	going	to	trail	him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At	once.	Will	you	come?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>“Not	now.	I’ll	gallop	over	by-and-by.	You	are	going	to	the	edge	of	the	Kerselec forest?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes;	you	will	hear	us	calling.	Are	you	coming,	Max	Fortin?	And	you,	Le Bihan?	Good;	take	the	dog-cart.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	big	gendarme	tramped	around	the	corner	to	the	stable	and	presently	returned mounted	on	a	strong	gray	horse;	his	sabre	shone	on	his	saddle;	his	pale	yellow and	white	facings	were	spotless.	The	little	crowd	of	white-coiffed	women	with their	children	fell	back,	as	Durand	touched	spurs	and	clattered	away	followed	by his	two	troopers.	Soon	after	Le	Bihan	and	Max	Fortin	also	departed	in	the mayor’s	dingy	dog-cart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Are	you	coming?”	piped	Le	Bihan	shrilly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	a	quarter	of	an	hour,”	I	replied,	and	went	back	to	the	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	opened	the	door	of	the	morning	room	the	death’s-head	moth	was	beating its	strong	wings	against	the	window.	For	a	second	I	hesitated,	then	walked	over and	opened	the	sash.	The	creature	fluttered	out,	whirred	over	the	flower	beds	a moment,	then	darted	across	the	moorland	toward	the	sea.	I	called	the	servants together	and	questioned	them.	Josephine,	Catherine,	Jean	Marie	Tregunc,	not one	of	them	had	heard	the	slightest	disturbance	during	the	night.	Then	I	told	Jean Marie	to	saddle	my	horse,	and	while	I	was	speaking	Lys	came	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dearest,”	I	began,	going	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	must	tell	me	everything	you	know,	Dick,”	she	interrupted,	looking	me earnestly	in	the	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	there	is	nothing	to	tell—only	a	drunken	brawl,	and	some	one	wounded.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you	are	going	to	ride—where,	Dick?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	over	to	the	edge	of	Kerselec	forest.	Durand	and	the	mayor,	and	Max Fortin,	have	gone	on,	following	a—a	trail.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	trail?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some	blood.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>“Where	did	they	find	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Out	in	the	road	there.”	Lys	crossed	herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does	it	come	near	our	house?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	near?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	comes	up	to	the	morning-room	window,”	said	I,	giving	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	hand	on	my	arm	grew	heavy.	“I	dreamed	last	night—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	did	I—”	but	I	thought	of	the	empty	cartridges	in	my	revolver,	and	stopped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	dreamed	that	you	were	in	great	danger,	and	I	could	not	move	hand	or	foot	to save	you;	but	you	had	your	revolver,	and	I	called	out	to	you	to	fire—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	did	fire!”	I	cried	excitedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You—you	fired?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	her	in	my	arms.	“My	darling,”	I	said,	“something	strange	has	happened—</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	that	I	cannot	understand	as	yet.	But,	of	course,	there	is	an explanation.	Last	night	I	thought	I	fired	at	the	Black	Priest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah!”	gasped	Lys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	that	what	you	dreamed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	yes,	that	was	it!	I	begged	you	to	fire—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	I	did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	heart	was	bearing	against	my	breast.	I	held	her	close	in	silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dick,”	she	said	at	length,	“perhaps	you	killed	the—the	thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	it	was	human	I	did	not	miss,”	I	answered	grimly.	“And	it	was	human,”	I	went on,	pulling	myself	together,	ashamed	of	having	so	nearly	gone	to	pieces.	“Of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>course	it	was	human!	The	whole	affair	is	plain	enough.	not	a	drunken	brawl,	as Durand	thinks;	it	was	a	drunken	lout’s	practical	joke,	for	which	he	has	suffered.	I suppose	I	must	have	filled	him	pretty	full	of	bullets,	and	he	has	crawled	away	to die	in	Kerselec	forest.	It’s	a	terrible	affair;	I’m	sorry	I	fired	so	hastily;	but	that idiot	Le	Bihan	and	Max	Fortin	have	been	working	on	my	nerves	till	I	am	as hysterical	as	a	schoolgirl,”	I	ended	angrily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	fired—but	the	window	glass	was	not	shattered,”	said	Lys	in	a	low	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	the	window	was	open,	then.	And	as	for	the—the	rest—I’ve	got	nervous indigestion,	and	a	doctor	will	settle	the	Black	Priest	for	me,	Lys.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	glanced	out	of	the	window	at	Tregunc	waiting	with	my	horse	at	the	gate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dearest,	I	think	I	had	better	go	to	join	Durand	and	the	others.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	will	go	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	no”’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	Dick.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t,	Lys.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	shall	suffer	every	moment	you	are	away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	ride	is	too	fatiguing,	and	we	can’t	tell	what	unpleasant	sight	you	may	come upon.	Lys,	you	don’t	really	think	there	is	anything	supernatural	in	this	affair?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dick,”	she	answered	gently,	“I	am	a	Bretonne.”	With	both	arms	around	my neck,	my	wife	said,	“Death	is	the	gift	of	God.	I	do	not	fear	it	when	we	are together.	But	alone—oh,	my	husband,	I	should	fear	a	God	who	could	take	you away	from	me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	kissed	each	other	soberly,	simply,	like	two	children.	Then	Lys	hurried	away to	change	her	gown,	and	I	paced	up	and	down	the	garden	waiting	for	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	came,	drawing	on	her	slender	gauntlers.	I	swung	her	into	the	saddle,	gave	a hasty	order	to	Jean	Marie,	and	mounted. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>Now,	to	quail	under	thoughts	of	terror	on	a	morning	like	this,	with	Lys	in	the saddle	beside	me,	no	matter	what	had	happened	or	might	happen,	was impossible.	Moreover,	Môme	came	sneaking	after	us.	I	asked	Tregunc	to	catch him,	for	I	was	afraid	he	might	be	brained	by	our	horses’	hoofs	if	he	followed,	but the	wily	puppy	dodged	and	bolted	after	Lys,	who	was	trotting	along	the	high-road.	“Never	mind,”	I	thought;	“if	he’s	hit	he’ll	live,	for	he	has	no	brains	to lose.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lys	was	waiting	for	me	in	the	road	beside	the	Shrine	of	Our	Lady	of	St.	Gildas when	I	joined	her.	She	crossed	herself,	I	doffed	my	cap,	then	we	shook	out	our bridles	and	galloped	toward	the	forest	of	Kerselec. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	said	very	little	as	we	rode.	I	always	loved	to	watch	Lys	in	the	saddle.	Her exquisite	figure	and	lovely	face	were	the	incarnation	of	youth	and	grace;	her curling	hair	glistened	like	threaded	gold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	of	the	corner	of	my	eve	I	saw	the	spoiled	puppy	Môme	come	bounding cheerfully	alongside,	oblivious	of	our	horses’	heels.	Our	road	swung	close	to	the cliffs.	A	filthy	cormorant	rose	from	the	black	rocks	and	flapped	heavily	across our	path.	Lys’s	horse	reared,	but	she	pulled	him	down,	and	pointed	at	the	bird with	her	riding	crop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	see,”	said	I;	“it	seems	to	be	going	our	way.	Curious	to	see	a	cormorant	in	a forest,	isn’t	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	a	bad	sign,”	said	Lys.	“You	know	that	Morbihan	proverb:	‘When	the cormorant	turns	from	the	sea,	Death	laughs	in	the	forest,	and	wise	woodsmen build	boats.’	“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wish,”	said	I	sincerely,	“that	there	were	fewer	proverbs	in	Brittany.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	were	in	sight	of	the	forest	now;	across	the	gorse	I	could	see	the	sparkle	of gendarmes’	trappings,	and	the	glitter	of	Le	Bihan’s	silver-buttoned	jacket.	The hedge	was	low	and	we	rook	it	without	difficulty,	and	trotted	across	the	moor	to where	Le	Bihan	and	Durand	stood	gesticulating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	bowed	ceremoniously	to	Lys	as	we	rode	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	trail	is	horrible—it	is	a	river,”	said	the	mayor	in	his	squeaky	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Monsieur	Darrel,	I	think	perhaps	madame	would	scarcely	care	to	come	any</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>nearer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lys	drew	bridle	and	looked	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	horrible!”	said	Durand,	walking	up	beside	me;	“it	looks	as	though	a bleeding	regiment	had	passed	this	way.	The	trail	winds	and	winds	about	there	in the	thickets;	we	lose	it	at	times,	but	we	always	find	it	again.	I	can’t	understand how	one	man—no,	not	twenty—could	bleed	like	that!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	halloo,	answered	by	another,	sounded	from	the	depths	of	the	forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	my	men;	they	are	following	the	trail,”	muttered	the	brigadier.	“God	alone knows	what	is	at	the	end!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shall	we	gallop	back,	Lys?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No;	let	us	ride	along	the	western	edge	of	the	woods	and	dismount.	The	sun	is	so hot	now,	and	I	should	like	to	rest	for	a	moment,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	western	forest	is	clear	of	anything	disagreeable,”	said	Durand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very	well,”	I	answered;	“call	me,	Le	Bihan,	if	you	find	anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lys	wheeled	her	mare,	and	I	followed	across	the	springy	heather,	Môme	trotting cheerfully	in	the	rear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	entered	the	sunny	woods	about	a	quarter	of	a	kilometre	from	where	we	left Durand.	I	took	Lys	from	her	horse,	flung	both	bridles	over	a	limb,	and,	giving my	wife	my	arm,	aided	her	to	a	flat	mossy	rock	which	overhung	a	shallow	brook gurgling	among	the	beech	rrees.	Lys	sat	down	and	drew	off	her	gauntlers.	Môme pushed	his	head	into	her	lap,	received	an	undeserved	caress,	and	came	doubtfully toward	me.	I	was	weak	enough	to	condone	his	offence,	but	I	made	him	lie	down at	my	feet,	greatly	to	his	disgust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rested	my	head	on	Lys’s	knees,	looking	up	at	the	sky	through	the	crossed branches	of	the	trees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	suppose	I	have	killed	him,”	I	said.	“It	shocks	me	terribly,	Lys.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	could	not	have	known,	dear.	He	may	have	been	a	robber,	and—if—nor—</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>Did—have	you	ever	fired	your	revolver	since	that	day	four	years	ago,	when	the Red	Admiral’s	son	tried	to	kill	you?	But	I	know	you	have	not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	said	I,	wondering.	“It’s	a	fact,	I	have	nor.	Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	don’t	you	remember	that	I	asked	you	to	let	me	load	it	for	you	the	day	when Yves	went	off,	swearing	to	kill	you	and	his	father?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I	do	remember.	Well?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I—I	took	the	cartridges	first	to	St.	Gildas	chapel	and	dipped	them	in	holy water.	You	must	not	laugh,	Dick,”	said	Lys	gently,	laying	her	cool	hands	on	my lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Laugh,	my	darling!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Overhead	the	October	sky	was	pale	amethyst,	and	the	sunlight	burned	like orange	flame	through	the	yellow	leaves	of	beech	and	oak.	Gnats	and	midges danced	and	wavered	overhead;	a	spider	dropped	from	a	twig	halfway	to	the ground	and	hung	suspended	on	the	end	of	his	gossamer	thread. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	sleepy,	dear?”	asked	Lys,	bending	over	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am—a	little;	I	scarcely	slept	two	hours	last	night,”	I	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	may	sleep,	if	you	wish,”	said	Lys,	and	touched	my	eyes	caressingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	my	head	heavy	on	your	knees?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	Dick.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	already	in	a	half	doze;	still	I	heard	the	brook	babbling	under	the	beeches and	the	humming	of	forest	flies	overhead.	Presently	even	these	were	stilled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	thing	I	knew	I	was	sitting	bolt	upright,	my	ears	ringing	with	a	scream, and	I	saw	Lys	cowering	beside	me,	covering	her	white	face	with	both	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	sprang	to	my	feet	she	cried	again	and	clung	to	my	knees.	I	saw	my	dog	rush growling	into	a	thicker,	then	I	heard	him	whimper,	and	he	came	backing	out, whining,	ears	flat,	tail	down.	I	stooped	and	disengaged	Lys’s	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>“Don’t	go,	Dick!”	she	cried.	“O	God,	it’s	the	Black	Priest!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	a	moment	I	had	leaped	across	the	brook	and	pushed	my	way	into	the	thicker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	empty.	I	stared	about	me;	I	scanned	every	tree	trunk,	every	bush. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly	I	saw	him.	He	was	seared	on	a	fallen	log,	his	head	resting	in	his	hands, his	rusty	black	robe	gathered	around	him.	For	a	moment	my	hair	stirred	under my	cap;	sweat	started	on	my	forehead	and	cheekbone;	then	I	recovered	my reason,	and	understood	that	the	man	was	human	and	was	probably	wounded	to death.	Ay,	to	death;	for	there,	at	my	feet,	lay	the	wet	trail	of	blood,	over	leaves and	stones,	down	into	the	little	hollow,	across	to	the	figure	in	black	resting silently	under	the	trees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	saw	that	he	could	not	escape	even	if	he	had	the	strength,	for	before	him,	almost at	his	very	feet,	lay	a	deep,	shining	swamp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	stepped	forward	my	foot	broke	a	twig.	At	the	sound	the	figure	started	a little,	then	its	head	fell	forward	again.	Its	face	was	masked.	Walking	up	to	the man,	I	bade	him	tell	where	he	was	wounded.	Durand	and	the	others	broke through	the	thicket	at	the	same	moment	and	hurried	to	my	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	are	you	who	hide	a	masked	face	in	a	priest’s	robe?”	said	the	gendarme loudly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	no	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See—see	the	stiff	blood	all	over	his	robe!”	muttered	Le	Bihan	to	Fortin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	will	not	speak,”	said	I. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	may	be	too	badly	wounded,”	whispered	Le	Bihan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	saw	him	raise	his	head,”	I	said;	“my	wife	saw	him	creep	up	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Durand	stepped	forward	and	touched	the	figure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Speak!”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Speak!”	quavered	Fortin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Durand	waited	a	moment,	then	with	a	sudden	upward	movement	he	stripped	off</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>the	mask	and	threw	back	the	man’s	head.	We	were	looking	into	the	eye	sockets of	a	skull.	Durand	stood	rigid;	the	mayor	shrieked.	The	skeleton	burst	out	from its	rotting	robes	and	collapsed	on	the	ground	before	us.	From	between	the	staring ribs	and	the	grinning	teeth	spurred	a	torrent	of	black	blood,	showering	the shrinking	grasses;	then	the	thing	shuddered,	and	fell	over	into	the	black	ooze	of the	bog.	Little	bubbles	of	iridescent	air	appeared	from	the	mud;	the	bones	were slowly	engulfed,	and,	as	the	last	fragments	sank	out	of	sight,	up	from	the	depths and	along	the	bank	crept	a	creature,	shiny,	shivering,	quivering	its	wings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	a	death’s-head	moth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wish	I	had	time	to	tell	you	how	Lys	outgrew	superstitions—for	she	never	knew the	truth	about	the	affair,	and	she	never	will	know,	since	she	has	promised	not	to read	this	book.	I	wish	I	might	tell	you	about	the	king	and	his	coronation,	and how	the	coronation	robe	fitted.	I	wish	that	I	were	able	to	write	how	Yvonne	and Herbert	Stuart	rode	to	a	boar	hunt	in	Quimperlé,	and	how	the	hounds	raced	the quarry	right	through	the	town,	overturning	three	gendarmes,	the	notary,	and	an old	woman.	But	I	am	becoming	garrulous,	and	Lys	is	calling	me	to	come	and hear	the	king	say	that	he	is	sleepy.	And	his	Highness	shall	not	be	kept	waiting. </p>
