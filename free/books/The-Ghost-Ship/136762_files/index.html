<p class="calibre1">The	sun	sank	below	the	horizon	that	evening	in	a	blaze	of	ruby	and	gold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 flooded	 the	 whole	 ocean	 to	 the	 westward,	 right	 up	 to	 the	 very	 zenith, with	a	wealth	of	opalescent	light	that	transformed	sea	and	sky	alike	into	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">living	 glory,	 so	 grand	 and	 glorious	 was	 the	 glowing	 harmony	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">kaleidoscopic	colouring	which	lit	up	the	arc	of	heaven	and	the	wide	waste</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 water	 beneath,	 stretching	 out	 and	 afar	 beyond	 ken.	 Aye,	 and	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">colouring,	too,	that	changed	its	hue	each	instant	with	marvellous	rapidity, </p>
<p class="calibre1">tint	alternating	with	tint,	and	tone	melting	into	tone	in	endless	succession</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	variety! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Throughout	the	day	the	weather	had	looked	more	than	threatening.	From</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	 early	 hour	 of	 the	 morning	 the	 wind	 had	 been	 constantly	 veering	 and shifting,	 showing	 a	 strong	 inclination	 to	 back;	 and	 now	 the	 sea	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">getting	up	and	the	white	horses	of	Neptune	had	already	begun	to	gambol</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	 the	 crests	 of	 the	 swelling	 billows,	 which	 heaved	 up	 and	 down	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 rolled	 onward	 with	 a	 heavy	 moaning	 sound,	 like	 one	 long,	 deep-</p>
<p class="calibre1">drawn	sigh! </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 looked	 as	 if	 the	 old	 monarch	 below,	 angered	 by	 the	 teasing	 of	 the frolicsome	 zephyrs,	 was	 gradually	 working	 himself	 up	 into	 a	 passion, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which	 would	 vent	 itself,	 most	 probably,	 ere	 long	 in	 a	 much	 more	 telling fashion	than	by	this	melancholy	moan,	so	different	to	the	sea-god’s	usual</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice	of	thunder! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes,	it	looked	threatening	enough	in	all	conscience! </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	brisk	breeze	had	been	blowing	from	the	nor’-east	before	breakfast,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	had	subsequently	shifted	to	the	nor’ard	at	noon,	veering	back	again, </p>
<p class="calibre1">first	 to	 the	 nor’-east	 and	 then	 to	 due	 east	 in	 the	 afternoon.	 The	 wind</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p5"></a>freshened	as	the	hours	wore	on,	being	now	accompanied	towards	sunset by	frequent	sharp	gusts,	a	sign	betokening	plainly	enough	to	a	seaman’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">eye	that	something	stiffer	was	brewing	up	for	us	by-and-by. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Glancing	 over	 the	 side,	 I	 noticed	 that	 our	 brave	 vessel,	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Star	 of	 the</i> <i class="calibre4">North</i>,	was	becoming	very	uneasy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 was	 running	 under	 her	 jib	 and	 foresail,	 with	 fore-topsail	 and	 fore-topgallantsail,	 being	 only	 square	 rigged	 forwards,	 like	 most	 ocean</p>
<p class="calibre1">steamers;	but,	in	order	to	save	coals	and	ease	the	engines,	the	skipper</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	set	the	fore	and	main	trysails	with	gaff-topsails	and	staysails	as	well, </p>
<p class="calibre1">piling	on	every	rag	he	could	spread. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 this	 press	 of	 canvas	 topping	 her	 unaccustomed	 hull,	 the	 poor	 old</p>
<p class="calibre1">barquey	 heeled	 over	 more	 and	 more	 as	 the	 violent	 gusts	 caught	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">broadside-on	at	intervals,	rolling,	too,	a	bit	on	the	wind	fetching	round	aft; </p>
<p class="calibre1">while,	her	stern	lifting	as	some	bigger	roller	than	usual	passed	under	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">keel,	 the	 screw	 would	 whiz	 round	 aimlessly	 in	 mid	 air,	 from	 missing	 its grip	 of	 the	 water,	 “racing,”	 as	 sailors	 say	 in	 their	 lingo,	 with	 a	 harsh grating	jar	that	set	my	teeth	on	edge,	and	seemed	to	vibrate	through	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	 spinal	 marrow	 as	 I	 stood	 for	 a	 moment	 on	 the	 line	 of	 deck</p>
<p class="calibre1">immediately	over	the	revolving	shaft. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 the	 same	 time	 also	 that	 the	 afterpart	 of	 the	 vessel	 rose	 up	 on	 the breast	 of	 one	 billowy	 mountain,	 her	 forefoot	 in	 turn	 would	 come	 down</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 a	 resonant	 “thwack”	 into	 the	 valley	 intervening	 between	 this	 roller and	the	next,	the	buoyant	old	barquey	dipping	her	bows	under	and	giving</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 star-crowned	 maiden	 with	 golden	 ringlets,	 that	 did	 duty	 for	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">figurehead,	 an	 impromptu	 shower	 bath	 as	 she	 parted	 the	 indignant</p>
<p class="calibre1">waves	with	her	glistening	black	hull,	sending	them	off	on	either	hand	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 contemptuous	 “swish”	 on	 their	 trying	 in	 mad	 desperation	 to	 leap	 on</p>
<p class="calibre1">board,	first	to	port	and	then	to	starboard,	as	the	ship	listed	in	her	roll. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was,	however,	but	a	vain	task	for	these	mad	myrmidons	of	Neptune	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">attempt,	strive	as	recklessly	as	they	might	in	their	wrath,	for	the	good	ship</p>
<p class="calibre1">spurned	 them	 with	 her	 forefoot	 and	 the	 star-crowned	 maiden	 bowed</p>
<p class="calibre1">mockingly	to	them	from	her	perch	above	the	bobstay,	laughing	in	her	glee</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	she	rode	over	them	triumphantly	and	sailed	along	onward;	and	so	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">baffled	 roysterers	 were	 forced	 to	 fall	 back	 discomforted	 from	 their	 rash</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p6"></a>onslaught,	 swirling	 away	 in	 circling	 eddies	 aft,	 where,	 anon,	 the	 cruel propeller	 tossed	 and	 tore	 them	 anew	 with	 its	 pitiless	 blades—ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">whirling	 round	 with	 painful	 iteration	 to	 the	 music	 of	 their	 monotonous</p>
<p class="calibre1">refrain,	“Thump-thump,	Thump-thump,”	and	ever	churning	up	the	already</p>
<p class="calibre1">seething	sea	into	a	mass	of	boiling,	brawling,	bubbling	foam	that	spread</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	astern	of	us	in	a	broad	shimmering	wake	in	the	shape	of	a	lady’s	fan, </p>
<p class="calibre1">stretching	backward	on	our	track	as	far	as	the	eye	could	see	and	flashing</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	sparks	of	fire	as	it	glittered	away	into	the	dim	distance,	like	an	ever-</p>
<p class="calibre1">widening	belt	of	diamonds	fringed	with	pearls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 SS	  <i class="calibre4">Star	 of	 the	 North</i>	 was	 a	 large	 schooner-rigged	 cargo	 steamer, strongly	 built	 of	 iron	 in	 watertight	 compartments,	 and	 of	 nearly	 two</p>
<p class="calibre1">thousand	 horsepower,	 but	 working	 up,	 under	 pressure,	 of	 nearly	 half	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	again	on	a	pinch,	having	been	originally	intended	for	the	passenger</p>
<p class="calibre1">trade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	belonged	to	one	of	the	great	ocean	lines	that	run	between	Liverpool</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 New	 York,	 and	 was	 now	 on	 her	 last	 outward	 trip	 for	 the	 year	 and rapidly	 nearing	 her	 western	 goal—the	 Fastnet	 light—and,	 according	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	reckoning	when	we	took	the	sun	at	noon,	in	latitude	42°	35	minutes</p>
<p class="calibre1">North,	and	longitude	50°	10	minutes	West,	that	is,	just	below	the	banks	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Newfoundland,	our	course	to	our	American	port	having	been	a	little	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">southerly	than	usual	for	the	season.	This	was	in	consequence	of	Captain</p>
<p class="calibre1">Applegarth,	 our	 skipper,	 wishing,	 as	 I	 said	 before,	 to	 take	 advantage	 of the	 varying	 winds	 of	 the	 northern	 ocean	 as	 much	 as	 possible,	 so	 as	 to economise	his	steam-power	and	limit	our	consumption	of	fuel;	for	freights</p>
<p class="calibre1">“across	 the	 herring-pond,”	 as	 the	 Yankees	 call	 it,	 are	 at	 a	 very	 low	 ebb nowadays,	 and	 it	 is	 naturally	 a	 serious	 consideration	 with	 shipowners</p>
<p class="calibre1">how	to	make	a	profit	out	of	the	carrying	trade	without	landing	themselves</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 bankruptcy	 court.	 So,	 they	 have	 to	 cut	 down	 their	 working</p>
<p class="calibre1">expenses	 to	 the	 lowest	 point	 practicable	 with	 efficiency,	 where	 “full</p>
<p class="calibre1">speed”	 all	 the	 way	 is	 not	 a	 vital	 necessity—as	 in	 the	 case	 of	 the	 mail steamers	and	first-class	passenger	ships	of	enormous	steam-power	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">corresponding	speed,	which,	of	course,	run	up	a	heavy	coal	bill,	for	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">always	 “carry	 on”	 all	 they	 can	 to	 and	 fro	 across	 the	 Atlantic, </p>
<p class="calibre1">accomplishing	the	passage	now	between	Queenstown	and	Sandy	Hook, </p>
<p class="calibre1">veritable	 greyhounds	 of	 the	 ocean	 that	 they	 are,	 within	 the	 six	 days,	 all told,	from	land	to	land.	Aye,	and	even	this	“record”	promises	to	be	beaten</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	near	future. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a>Prior	 to	 our	 leaving	 Liverpool	 on	 this	 voyage,	 the	 very	 day	 before	 we sailed,	 in	 fact,	 greatly	 to	 my	 surprise	 and	 satisfaction,	 as	 may	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagined,	 I	 was	 made	 fourth	 officer,	 the	 owners	 having	 unexpectedly</p>
<p class="calibre1">promoted	me	from	the	position	of	“apprentice,”	which	I	had	filled	up	to	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">last	run	home	without	any	thought	of	so	speedy	a	“rise.”	Of	course	I	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 thank	 my	 old	 friend	 Captain	 Applegarth	 for	 my	 good	 fortune,	 though</p>
<p class="calibre1">why	the	skipper	thus	spoke	up	for	me	I’m	sure	I	cannot	say,	for	I	was	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">young	 to	 hold	 such	 a	 subordinate	 post,	 having	 only	 just	 turned	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">seventeenth	 year,	 besides	 being	 boyish	 enough	 in	 all	 conscience,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">beardless,	 too,	 at	 that!	 But,	 be	 that	 as	 it	 may,	 fourth	 officer	 I	 was	 at	 the time	of	which	I	write. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	recollect	the	evening	well	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 on	 the	 seventh	 of	 November,	 the	 anniversary	 of	 my	 birthday,	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">circumstance	 which	 would	 alone	 suffice	 to	 imprint	 the	 date	 on	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">memory	were	I	at	all	disposed	to	forget	it.	But	that	is	not	very	likely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No,	I	can	assure	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	would	be	impossible	for	me	to	do	that,	as	you	will	readily	believe	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	come	to	know	my	story;	for,	on	this	eventful	evening	there	happened</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	which,	somehow	or	other,	thenceforth,	whether	owing	to	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">visionary	 folk	 term	 “Destiny,”	 or	 from	 its	 arising	 through	 some	 curious conjuncture	 of	 things	 beyond	 the	 limits	 of	 mere	 chance,	 appeared	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">exercise	a	mysterious	influence	on	my	life,	affecting	the	whole	tenor	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">course	of	my	subsequent	career. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	better	tell	you,	however,	what	occurred,	and	then	you	will	be	able	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">judge	for	yourself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Two. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">“Sail	Ho!” </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Away	 forward,	 I	 remember,	 the	 ship’s	 bell	 under	 the	 break	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">forecastle,	 or	 “fo’c’s’le,”	 as	 it	 is	 pronounced	 in	 nautical	 fashion,	 was	 just striking	“two	bells”	in	the	first	day	watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>In	 other	 words,	 more	 suited	 to	 a	 landsman’s	 comprehension,	 it	 was	 five o’clock	 in	 the	 afternoon	 when	 I	 came	 on	 deck	 from	 my	 spell	 of	 leisure below,	 to	 relieve	 Mr	 Spokeshave,	 the	 third	 officer,	 then	 on	 duty,	 and	 the sight	I	caught	of	the	heavens,	across	the	gangway,	was	so	beautiful	that	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">paused	 a	 moment	 or	 two	 to	 look	 at	 the	 sunset	 before	 going	 up	 on	 the bridge,	 where	 Mr	 Spokeshave,	 I	 had	 no	 doubt,	 was	 anxiously	 awaiting</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	and,	equally	certainly,	grumbling	at	my	detaining	him	from	his	“tea!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 gentleman,	 however,	 was	 not	 too	 particular	 as	 to	 time	 in	 relieving others	 when	 off	 watch,	 and	 I	 did	 not	 concern	 myself	 at	 all	 about	 Master</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Conky,”	as	all	of	us	called	him	aboard,	on	account	of	a	very	prominent, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and,	so	to	speak,	striking	feature	of	his	countenance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Otherwise,	 he	 was	 an	 insignificant-looking	 little	 chap,	 as	 thin	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">threadpaper	and	barely	five	feet	high;	but	he	was	always	swelling	himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">out,	 and	 trying	 to	 look	 a	 bigger	 personage	 than	 he	 was,	 with	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">exception	 that	 is,	 of	 his	 nose,	 which	 was	 thoroughly	 Napoleonic	 in	 size and	contour.	Altogether,	what	with	the	airs	he	gave	himself	and	his	selfish</p>
<p class="calibre1">disposition	and	nasty	cantankerous	temper,	Master	Spokeshave	was	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	general	favourite	on	board,	although	we	did	not	quarrel	openly	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	beggar	or	call	him	by	his	nickname	when	he	was	present,	albeit	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	very	hard	to	bear	with	sometimes! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	 not	 thinking	 of	 him	 or	 his	 tea	 or	 that	 it	 was	 time	 for	 me	 to	 go	 on watch,	 but	 awed	 by	 the	 majesty	 of	 God’s	 handiwork	 in	 the	 wonderful</p>
<p class="calibre1">colouring,	of	the	afterglow,	which	no	mortal	artist	could	have	painted,	no, </p>
<p class="calibre1">none	 but	 He	 who	 limns	 the	 rainbow,	 I	 stood	 there	 so	 long	 by	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">gangway,	 gazing	 at	 the	 glorious	 panorama	 outspread	 before	 me,	 that	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">declare	I	clean	forgot	Spokeshave’s	very	existence,	all-important	though</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	considered	himself,	and	I	was	only	recalled	to	myself	by	the	voice	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr	Fosset,	our	first	officer,	who	had	approached	without	my	seeing	him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">speaking	close	beside	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ah,	 he	 was	 a	 very	 different	 sort	 of	 fellow	 to	 little	 Spokeshave,	 being	 a nice,	 jolly,	 good-natured	 chap,	 chubby	 and	 brown-bearded,	 and	 liked	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1">every	one	from	the	skipper	down	to	the	cabin	boy.	He	was	a	bit	obstinate, </p>
<p class="calibre1">though,	 was	 Mr	 Fosset;	 and	 “as	 pigheaded	 as	 a	 Scotch	 barber,”	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Applegarth	would	say	sometimes	when	he	was	arguing	with	him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 the	 first	 mate	 would	 always	 stick	 to	 his	 own	 opinion,	 no	 matter	 if	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>were	right	or	wrong,	nothing	said	on	the	other	side	ever	convincing	him	to the	contrary	and	making	him	change	his	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	caught	sight	of	me	now	leaning	against	the	bulwarks	and	looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	the	side	amidships,	just	abaft	the	engine-room	hatch,	as	he	passed</p>
<p class="calibre1">along	 the	 gangway	 towards	 the	 bridge	 which	 he	 was	 about	 to	 mount	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	a	look	at	the	standard	compass	and	see	what	course	the	helmsman</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	steering,	on	his	way	from	the	poop,	where	I	had	noticed	him	talking</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 the	 skipper	 as	 I	 came	 up	 the	 booby-hatch	 from	 below.	 “Hullo, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haldane!”	he	cried,	shouting	almost	in	my	ear,	and	giving	me	a	playful	dig</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	ribs	at	the	same	time;	this	nearly	knocked	all	the	breath	out	of	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">body.	“Is	that	you,	my	boy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	aye,	sir,”	I	replied,	hesitating,	for	I	was	startled,	alike	by	his	rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">too	 demonstrative	 greeting	 as	 well	 as	 his	 unexpected	 approach.	 “I—I—</p>
<p class="calibre1">mean,	yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr	Fosset	laughed;	a	jolly,	catching	laugh	it	was—that	of	a	man	who	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	 dined	 comfortably	 and	 enjoyed	 his	 dinner,	 and	 did	 not	 have, </p>
<p class="calibre1">apparently,	 a	 care	 in	 the	 world.	 “Why,	 what’s	 the	 matter	 with	 you, </p>
<p class="calibre1">youngster?”	said	he	in	his	chaffing	way.	“Been	having	a	caulk	on	the	sly</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	dreaming	of	home,	I	bet?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	sir,”	I	answered	gravely;	“I’ve	not	been	to	sleep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you	look	quite	dazed,	my	boy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 made	 no	 reply	 to	 this	 observation,	 and	 Mr	 Fosset	 then	 dropped	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">bantering	manner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	 me,”	 said	 he	 kindly,	 “is	 there	 anything	 wrong	 with	 you	 below?	 Has that	cross-grained	little	shrimp,	Spokeshave,	hang	him!	been	bullying	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">again,	like	he	did	the	other	day?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	 no,	 sir;	 he’s	 on	 the	 bridge	 now,	 and	 I	 ought	 to	 have	 relieved	 him before	 this,”	 I	 replied,	 only	 thinking	 of	 poor	 “Conky”	 and	 his	 tea	 then	 for the	first	time.	“I	wasn’t	even	dreaming	of	him;	I’m	sure	I	beg	his	pardon!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	you	were	dreaming	of	some	one	perhaps	‘nearer	and	dearer’	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spokeshave,”	 rejoined	 Mr	 Fosset,	 with	 another	 genial	 laugh.	 “You	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>quite	 in	 a	 brown	 study	 when	 I	 gave	 you	 that	 dig	 in	 the	 ribs.	 What’s	 the matter,	my	boy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 was	 looking	 at	 that,	 sir,”	 said	 I	 simply,	 in	 response	 to	 his	 question, pointing	 upwards	 to	 the	 glory	 in	 the	 heavens.	 “Isn’t	 it	 grand?	 Isn’t	 it glorious?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 was	 a	 poser;	 for	 the	 first	 mate,	 though	 good-natured	 and	 good-</p>
<p class="calibre1">humoured	enough,	and	probably	a	thinking	man,	too,	in	his	way,	was	too</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter-of-fact	 a	 person	 to	 indulge	 in	 “dreamy	 sentimentalities,”	 as	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 have	 styled	 my	 deeper	 thoughts!	 A	 sunset	 to	 him	 was	 only	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sunset,	 saving	 in	 so	 far	 as	 it	 served	 to	 denote	 any	 change	 of	 weather, which	aspect	his	seaman’s	eye	readily	took	note	of	without	any	pointing</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	 on	 my	 part;	 so	 he	 rather	 chilled	 my	 enthusiasm	 by	 his	 reply	 now	 to me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	yes,	it’s	very	fine	and	all	that,	youngster,”	he	observed	in	an	off-hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">manner	that	grated	on	my	feelings,	making	me	wish	I	had	not	spoken	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">gushingly.	“I	think	that	sky	shows	signs	of	a	blow	before	the	night	is	over, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which	will	give	you	something	better	to	do	than	star-gazing!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t	very	well	do	that	now,	sir,”	said	I	slily,	with	a	grin	at	catching	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">tripping.	“Why,	the	stars	aren’t	out	yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	may	be,	Master	Impudence,”	replied	Mr	Fosset,	all	genial	again	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">laughing	too;	“but	they’ll	soon	be	popping	out	overhead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,	 sir,	 it	 is	 quite	 light	 still,”	 I	 persisted.	 “See,	 it	 is	 as	 bright	 as	 day	 all round,	just	as	at	noontide!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	 but	 it’ll	 be	 precious	 dark	 soon!	 It	 grows	 dusk	 in	 less	 than	 a	 jiffey after	the	sun	dips	in	these	latitudes	at	this	time	o’	year,”	said	he.	“Hullo!	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">say,	though,	that	reminds	me,	Haldane—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	 what,	 sir?”	 I	 asked	 as	 he	 stopped	 abruptly	 at	 this	 point.	 “Anything	 I can	do	for	you,	Mr	Fosset?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	my	boy,	nothing,”	he	replied	reflectively,	and	looking	for	the	moment</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 be	 in	 as	 deep	 a	 brown	 study	 as	 he	 accused	 me	 of	 being	 just	 now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop,	though,	I	tell	you	what	you	can	do.	Run	forwards	and	see	what	that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>lazy	 lubber	 of	 a	 lamp-trimmer	 is	 about.	 He’s	 always	 half	 an	 hour	 or	 so behind	 time,	 and	 seems	 to	 get	 later	 every	 day.	 Wake	 him	 up	 and	 make</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	hoist	our	masthead	lantern	and	fix	the	side	lights	in	position,	for	it’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">soon	 be	 dark,	 I	 bet	 ’ee,	 in	 spite	 of	 all	 that	 flare-up	 aloft	 over	 there,	 and we’re	 now	 getting	 in	 the	 track	 of	 the	 homeward-bounders	 crossing	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Banks,	 and	 have	 to	 keep	 a	 sharp	 look-out	 and	 let	 ’em	 know	 where	 we</p>
<p class="calibre1">are,	to	avoid	any	chance	of	collision.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	aye,	sir,”	I	cried,	making	my	way	along	the	gangway	by	the	side	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	deckhouse	towards	the	fo’c’s’le,	which	was	still	lit	up	by	the	afterglow</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 if	 on	 fire.	 “I’ll	 see	 to	 it	 all	 right,	 and	 get	 our	 steam	 lights	 rigged	 up	 at once,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	 saying,	 in	 another	 minute	 or	 so,	 scrambling	 over	 a	 lot	 of	 empty	 coal sacks	and	other	loose	gear	that	littered	the	deck,	besides	getting	tripped</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	 by	 the	 tackle	 of	 the	 ash	 hoist,	 which	 I	 did	 not	 see	 in	 time	 from	 the glare	 of	 the	 sky	 coming	 right	 in	 my	 eyes,	 I	 gained	 the	 lee	 side	 of	 the cook’s	 galley	 at	 the	 forward	 end	 of	 the	 deckhouse.	 Here,	 as	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">conjectured,	I	found	old	Greazer,	our	lamp-trimmer.	This	worthy,	who	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">quite	a	character	in	his	way,	was	a	superannuated	fireman	belonging	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	line,	whom	age	and	long	years	of	toil	had	unfitted	for	the	rougher	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	 arduous	 duties	 of	 his	 vocation	 in	 the	 stoke-hold,	 and	 who	 now, </p>
<p class="calibre1">instead	 of	 trimming	 coals	 in	 the	 furnaces	 below,	 trimmed	 wicks	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">attended	 to	 the	 lamps	 about	 the	 ship,	 on	 deck	 and	 elsewhere.	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">managed,	I	may	add,	to	make	his	face	so	dirty	in	the	carrying	out	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lighter	duties	to	which	he	was	now	called,	probably	in	fond	recollection	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 byegone	 grimy	 task	 in	 the	 engine-room,	 that	 his	 somewhat	 personal</p>
<p class="calibre1">cognomen	was	very	appropriate,	his	countenance	being	oily	and	smutty</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	a	degree! </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 was	 a	 very	 lazy	 old	 chap,	 however;	 and,	 in	 lieu	 of	 attending	 to	 his work,	 was	 generally	 to	 be	 found	 confabulating	 with	 our	 mulatto	 cook, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Accra	Prout,	as	I	discovered	him	now,	more	bent	on	worming	out	an	extra</p>
<p class="calibre1">lot	 of	 grog	 from	 the	 chef	 of	 the	 galley	 in	 exchange	 for	 a	 lump	 of	 “hard” </p>
<p class="calibre1">tobacco,	 than	 thinking	 of	 masthead	 lanterns	 or	 the	 ship’s	 side	 lights, </p>
<p class="calibre1">green	and	red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 are	 you	 about,	 lamp-trimmer?”	 I	 called	 out	 sharply	 on	 catching</p>
<p class="calibre1">sight	 of	 him	 palavering	 there	 with	 the	 mulatto,	 the	 artful	 beggar	 furtively</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>slipping	the	tin	pannikin	out	of	which	he	had	been	drinking	into	the	bosom of	his	jumper.	“Here’s	two	bells	struck	and	no	lights	up!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Two	bells,	sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	two	bells,”	I	repeated,	taking	no	notice	of	his	affected	air	of	surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	 the	 ship’s	 bell	 right	 over	 your	 head	 where	 you	 stand,	 and	 you must	have	heard	it	strike	not	five	minutes	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lor’,	Master	Dick,	may	I	die	a	foul	death	ashore	if	I	ever	heard	a	stroke,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 replied	 as	 innocently	 as	 you	 please.	 “Howsomdever,	 the	 lamps	 is	 all right,	sir.	I	ain’t	’ave	forgot	’em.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 all	 right,	 then,	 Greazer,”	 I	 said,	 not	 being	 too	 hard	 on	 him,	 and excusing	the	sly	wink	he	gave	to	Prout	as	he	told	his	barefaced	banger</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	not	hearing	the	bell,	in	memory	of	his	past	services.	“Come	along</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	and	rig	them	up	smart,	or	you’ll	have	Mr	Fosset	after	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Making	him	hoist	our	masthead	light	on	the	foremast,	twenty	feet	above</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	deck,	according	to	the	usual	Board	of	Trade	regulations	for	steamers</p>
<p class="calibre1">under	way	at	sea,	I	then	marched	him	before	me	along	the	deck	and	saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	 place	 our	 side	 lights	 in	 their	 proper	 position,	 the	 green	 one	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">starboard	and	the	red	on	our	port	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Old	Greazer	then	mounted	the	bridge-ladder,	in	advance	of	me,	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">binnacle	lamp	in	his	hand	to	put	that	in	its	place,	and,	as	I	followed	slowly</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	his	slow	footsteps,	for	the	ex-fireman	was	not	now	quick	of	movement, </p>
<p class="calibre1">an	accident	in	the	stoke-hold	having	crippled	him	years	ago,	I	half-turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">round	as	I	ascended	the	laddering	to	have	a	look	again	at	the	horizon	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">leeward	 over	 our	 port	 quarters,	 when	 I	 fancied,	 when	 advancing	 a	 foot</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	lamp-trimmer,	I	had	seen	something	to	the	southward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	another	instant	my	fancy	became	a	certainty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes,	there,	in	the	distance,	sailing	at	an	angle	to	our	course,	right	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 wind,	 was	 a	 large	 full-rigged	 ship.	 Everything,	 though,	 was	 not	 right with	her,	as	I	noted	the	moment	I	made	her	out,	with	her	white	canvas	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">crimson	 from	 a	 last	 expiring	 gleam	 of	 the	 afterglow;	 for	 I	 could	 see	 that her	sails	were	tattered	and	torn,	with	the	ragged	ends	blowing	out	loose</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	boltropes	in	the	most	untidy	fashion,	unkempt,	uncared	for! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>Besides,	 she	 was	 flying	 a	 signal	 of	 distress,	 patent	 to	 every	 sailor	 that has	ever	crossed	the	seas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 flag	 was	 hoisted	 half-mast	 high	 from	 the	 peak	 halliards.	 Half-mast</p>
<p class="calibre1">high! </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	did	not	wait,	nor	did	I	want,	to	see	anything	further.	No,	that	was	enough</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	me;	and,	springing	on	to	the	bridge	with	a	bound	that	nearly	knocked</p>
<p class="calibre1">poor	 old	 Greazer	 down	 on	 his	 marrowbones	 as	 he	 stopped	 to	 put	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lantern	into	the	binnacle,	I	shouted	out	in	a	ringing	voice	that	echoed	fore</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 aft,	 startling	 everybody	 aboard,	 even	 myself,	 “Sail	 ho!	 A	 ship	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">distress!	Sail	ho!” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Did	I	Dream	It? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	 away,	 Haldane?”	 cried	 Mr	 Fosset,	 the	 first	 to	 notice	 my	 shout, </p>
<p class="calibre1">catching	up	a	telescope	that	lay	handy	on	the	top	of	the	wheel-house	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 bridge;	 and,	 in	 his	 hurry,	 eagerly	 scanning	 every	 portion	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">horizon	but	the	right	one.	“I	don’t	see	her!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	she	is,	sir,	away	to	the	right!”	said	I,	equally	flurried,	pointing	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	lee	rail	in	the	direction	where	I	had	observed	the	ship	only	a	second</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	as	I	mounted	the	bridge-ladder,	although	I	could	not	actually	make</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	out	distinctly	at	the	moment	now,	on	account	of	the	smoke	from	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">funnels,	which,	just	then,	came	belching	forth	in	a	thick,	black	cloud	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">streamed	 away	 to	 leeward,	 athwart	 our	 starboard	 beam,	 obscuring	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">outlook. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	away,	sir;	out	there!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I	can’t	see	anything!”	ejaculated	Mr	Fosset	impatiently,	rising	to	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">feet	 after	 stooping	 down	 to	 the	 level	 of	 the	 bridge	 cloth,	 trying	 to	 get	 a sight	 of	 the	 strange	 vessel	 as	 best	 he	 could	 under	 the	 cloud	 of	 smoke, which	was	now	trailing	out	along	the	horizon,	blown	far	away	to	leeward</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	the	strong	wind	across	our	beam.	“I’m	sure	I	can’t	see	anything	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">there,	youngster;	you	must	have	dreamt	it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>“Yes,	when	you	were	lolling	about	in	the	waist	below	there,	just	now,”	put in	 my	 friend,	 Master	 Spokeshave,	 who	 had	 been	 pretending	 to	 look-out</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	his	end	of	the	bridge	because	he	thought	he	ought	to	do	so	as	Mr</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fosset	 was	 there,	 although	 he	 really	 couldn’t	 possibly	 see	 anything	 aft from	 that	 position	 on	 the	 port	 side,	 on	 account	 of	 the	 wheel-house	 and funnel,	 which	 were	 of	 course	 abaft	 the	 bridge,	 blocking	 the	 view.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">cantankerous	little	beggar	sniffed	his	beak	of	a	nose	in	the	air	as	if	trying</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	look	down	on	me,	though	he	was	half	a	head	shorter,	and	spoke	in	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">nasty	 sneering	 way	 of	 his	 that	 always	 made	 me	 mad.	 He	 did	 enjoy</p>
<p class="calibre1">growling	at	any	one	when	he	had	the	chance;	and	so	he	went	on	snarling</p>
<p class="calibre1">now,	like	a	cat	behind	an	area	railing	at	a	dog	which	couldn’t	get	at	it	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">stop	its	venomous	spitting.	“I	saw	you,	my	joker,	star-gazing	down	there, </p>
<p class="calibre1">instead	of	coming	up	here	to	relieve	me	at	the	proper	time!	I	believe	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	sang	out	about	the	ship	to	cover	your	laziness	and	take	a	rise	out	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">us!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	did	nothing	of	the	sort,	Mr	Spokeshave,”	I	answered	indignantly,	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	 beast	 sniggered	 away	 and	 grinned	 at	 Mr	 Fosset	 as	 if	 he	 had	 said something	uncommonly	smart	at	my	expense.	I	saw,	however,	where	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoe	 pinched.	 He	 was	 angry	 at	 my	 having	 kept	 him	 waiting	 for	 his	 tea, and	 hence	 his	 spiteful	 allusion	 to	 my	 being	 late	 coming	 on	 watch;	 so	 I was	just	going	to	give	him	a	sharp	rejoinder,	referring	to	his	love	for	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	stomach,	a	weak	point	with	him	and	a	common	joke	with	us	all	below</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	meal-times,	when,	ere	I	could	get	a	word	out	of	the	scathing	rebuke	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">intended	 for	 him,	 the	 smoke	 trail	 suddenly	 lifted	 a	 bit	 to	 leeward	 and leaving	the	horizon	clear,	I	caught	sight	again	of	the	ship	I	had	seen	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	rail.	This,	of	course,	at	once	changed	the	current	of	my	thoughts;	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">so,	 without	 troubling	 my	 head	 any	 further	 about	 “Conky,”	 I	 sang	 out	 as eagerly	as	before	to	the	first	mate,	all	the	more	anxious	now	to	prove	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	been	right	in	the	first	instance,	“There	she	is,	Mr	Fosset,	there	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">is!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	on	earth	are	you	squinting	now,	boy?”	said	he,	a	bit	huffy	at	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">making	 her	 out	 and	 apparently	 inclined	 to	 Spokeshave’s	 opinion	 that	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	not	really	seen	her	at	all.	“Where	away?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There,	sir,	away	to	leeward,”	cried	I,	almost	jumping	over	the	bridge	rail</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	my	excitement.	“She’s	nearly	abreast	of	our	mizzen	chains	and	not	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">mile	off.	She	seems	coming	up	on	the	port	tack,	sir!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>For,	strangely	enough,	although	we	were	going	ten	knots	good	by	the	aid of	the	wind	that	had	worked	round	more	abeam,	so	that	all	our	fore	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">aft	sail	drew,	while	the	ship,	which,	when	I	saw	her	before,	seemed	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">running	with	the	nor’-easter	and	sailing	at	a	tangent	to	our	course	so	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 ought	 really	 to	 have	 increased	 her	 distance	 from	 us,	 now,	 on	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">contrary,	appeared	ever	so	much	nearer,	as	if	she	had	either	altered	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">helm	 or	 drifted	 closer	 by	 the	 aid	 of	 some	 ocean	 current	 in	 the	 interim; albeit,	barely	five	minutes	at	the	best,	if	that,	had	only	elapsed	since	I	first</p>
<p class="calibre1">sighted	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But,	 stranger	 still,	 Mr	 Fosset	 could	 not	 see	 her,	 when	 there	 she	 was	 as plain	as	the	sun	setting	in	the	west	awhile	ago—at	least	to	my	eyes;	and, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	she	approached	nearer	yet	in	some	unaccountable	way,	for	her	bows</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 pointed	 from	 us	 and	 the	 wind,	 of	 course,	 was	 blowing	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">opposite	direction,	she	being	on	our	lee,	I	declare	I	could	distinctly	see	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">female	figure,	like	that	of	a	young	girl	with	long	hair,	on	the	deck	aft;	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">beside	her	I	also	noticed	a	large	black	dog,	jumping	up	and	down! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sure	I	can’t	see	any	ship,	youngster,”	said	Mr	Fosset	at	the	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	while	he	was	actually	speaking,	I	observed	the	sailing	vessel	to	yaw</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 her	 course,	 her	 ragged	 canvas	 flattening	 against	 the	 masts	 as	 if	 she were	 coming	 about,	 although	 from	 the	 way	 her	 head	 veered	 about,	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1">did	not	seem	to	be	under	any	control.	“There’s	nothing	in	sight,	Haldane, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 tell	 you.	 What	 you	 perhaps	 thought	 was	 a	 ship	 is	 that	 big	 black	 cloud rising	to	the	southward.	It	looks	like	one	of	those	nasty	sea	fogs	working</p>
<p class="calibre1">up,	and	we’ll	have	to	keep	a	precious	sharp	look-out	to-night,	I	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	no	ship	there,”	echoed	my	friend	“Conky,”	tapping	his	forehead</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	a	very	offensive	way	to	intimate	that	I	had	“a	screw	loose	in	the	upper</p>
<p class="calibre1">storey,”	as	the	saying	goes,	grinning	the	while	as	I	could	see	very	well	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	dim	light	and	poking	his	long	nose	up	in	the	air	in	supreme	contempt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	boy	is	either	mad,	or	drunk,	or	dreaming,	as	you	say,	sir.	It	is	all	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">cock	 and	 a	 bull	 yarn	 about	 his	 sighting	 a	 vessel,	 and	 he	 only	 wants	 to brave	it	out.	There’s	no	ship	there!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	 you	 see	 anything,	 Atkins?”	 asked	 Mr	 Fosset	 of	 the	 man	 steering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	away	to	leeward,	I	mean.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	sir,”	answered	the	sailor;	“not	a	speck,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>“Do	you	see	anything,	lamp-trimmer?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No;	can’t	say	I	does,	sir,”	replied	old	Greazer,	after	a	long	squint	over	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">lee	 in	 the	 direction	 pointed	 out,	 “Not	 a	 sight	 of	 a	 sail,	 nor	 a	 light,	 nor nothink!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	curious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For,	 at	 that	 very	 moment,	 when	 the	 first	 mate	 and	 Spokeshave	 and	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">helmsman	and	lamp-trimmer,	standing	on	the	bridge	beside	me,	one	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	 said	 they	 could	 see	 nothing,	 I	 declare	 to	 you	 I	 saw	 not	 only	 the	 ship and	the	figures	on	her	deck,	but	I	noticed	that	the	girl	on	the	poop	waved</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	scarf	or	handkerchief,	as	if	imploring	our	assistance;	and,	at	the	same</p>
<p class="calibre1">time,	 the	 dog	 near	 her	 bounded	 up	 against	 the	 bulwarks,	 and	 I	 can</p>
<p class="calibre1">solemnly	 assert	 from	 the	 evidence	 of	 my	 ears	 that	 I	 heard	 the	 animal</p>
<p class="calibre1">distinctly	 bark,	 giving	 out	 that	 joyous	 sort	 of	 bark	 with	 which	 a	 well-dispositioned	dog	invariably	greets	a	friend	of	his	master	or	mistress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	could	not	make	it	out	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	most	mysterious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,	look,	Mr	Fosset!”	I	cried	excitedly.	“There	she	is	now!	There	she	is, </p>
<p class="calibre1">coming	up	on	our	lee	quarter!	Why,	you	must	be	all	blind!	I	can	not	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	the	ship	distinctly,	but	also	right	down	on	to	her	deck!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nonsense,	 boy;	 you’d	 better	 go	 below!”	 said	 the	 first	 mate	 brusquely, </p>
<p class="calibre1">while	 Spokeshave	 sniggered	 and	 whispered	 something	 to	 the	 lamp-</p>
<p class="calibre1">trimmer	 and	 man	 at	 the	 wheel	 that	 made	 them	 both	 laugh	 out	 right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	something	wrong	with	you	to-night,	Haldane,	for	you	seem	quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	your	chump,	so	you’d	better	go	below	and	sleep	it	off.	There’s	no	ship</p>
<p class="calibre1">near	us,	I	tell	you!	What	you	imagined	to	be	a	sailing	vessel	is	that	dark</p>
<p class="calibre1">cloud	 there,	 coming	 up	 from	 the	 leeward,	 which	 is	 fast	 shutting	 out	 the horizon	 from	 view.	 It’s	 a	 sea	 fog,	 such	 as	 are	 frequently	 met	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">hereabouts	below	the	Banks,	as	we	are	now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 true	 enough	 about	 the	 cloud,	 or	 mist,	 or	 fog,	 or	 whatever	 it	 was; for,	as	Mr	Fosset	spoke,	the	darkness	closed	in	around	us	like	a	wall	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 ship	 that	 I	 swear	 I	 had	 seen	 the	 moment	 before	 vanished,	 sky	 and sea	 and	 everything	 else	 disappearing	 also	 at	 the	 same	 instant,	 leaving</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>us,	as	it	were,	isolated	in	space,	the	veil	of	vapour	being	impenetrable! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Four. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A	Conflict	of	Authority. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	then	Captain	Applegarth	appeared	on	the	scene. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	gone	down	by	the	companion-way	into	the	saloon	below,	after	Mr</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fosset	had	left	the	poop,	to	look	at	the	barometer	in	his	cabin,	and	now</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	along	the	upper	deck	and	on	to	the	bridge	amidships,	startling	us</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	his	sudden	presence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	skipper	had	a	sharp	eye,	which	was	so	trained	by	observation	in	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">sorts	of	weather	that	he	could	see	in	the	dark,	like	a	cat,	almost	as	well</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	he	could	by	daylight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking	 round	 and	 scanning	 our	 faces	 as	 well	 as	 he	 could	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">prevailing	gloom,	he	soon	perceived	that	something	was	wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh!”	he	exclaimed.	“What’s	the	row	about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	 no	 row,	 sir,”	 explained	 the	 first	 mate	 in	 an	 off-hand	 tone	 of bravado,	 which	 he	 tried	 to	 give	 a	 jocular	 ring	 to,	 but	 could	 not	 very successfully.	 “This	 youngster	 Haldane	 here	 swears	 he	 saw	 a	 full-rigged</p>
<p class="calibre1">ship	on	our	lee	quarter	awhile	ago,	flying	a	signal	of	distress;	but	neither</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr	Spokeshave,	who	was	on	the	watch,	nor	myself,	could	make	her	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	Haldane	said	he	saw	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Indeed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 sir,”	 continued	 Mr	 Fosset;	 “nor	 could	 the	 helmsman	 or	 old	 Greazer here,	 who	 came	 up	 with	 the	 binnacle	 lamp	 at	 the	 time.	 Not	 one	 of	 us could	see	this	wonderful	ship	of	Haldane’s,	though	it	was	pretty	clear	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">round	then,	and	we	all	looked	in	the	direction	to	which	he	pointed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	strange,”	said	Captain	Applegarth,	“very	strange.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>“Quite	so,	sir,	just	what	we	all	think,	sir,”	chimed	in	Master	Spokeshave, putting	in	his	oar.	“Not	a	soul	here	on	the	bridge,	sir,	observed	anything	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	 ship	 of	 any	 sort,	 leastways	 one	 flying	 a	 signal	 of	 distress,	 such	 as Dick	Haldane	said	he	saw.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Humph!”	ejaculated	the	skipper,	as	if	turning	the	matter	over	in	his	mind</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 the	 moment;	 and	 then	 addressing	 me	 point	 blank	 he	 asked	 me</p>
<p class="calibre1">outright,	“Do	you	really	believe	you	saw	this	ship,	Haldane?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 sir,”	 I	 answered	 as	 directly	 as	 he	 had	 questioned	 me;	 “I’ll	 swear	 I did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 I	 don’t	 want	 you	 to	 do	 that;	 I’ll	 take	 your	 word	 for	 it	 without	 any swearing,	Haldane,”	said	the	skipper	to	this,	speaking	to	me	quietly	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	kindly	as	if	he	had	been	my	father.	“But	listen	to	me,	my	boy.	I	do	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">doubt	 your	 good	 faith	 for	 a	 moment,	 mind	 that.	 Still,	 are	 you	 sure	 that what	 you	 believe	 you	 saw	 might	 not	 have	 been	 some	 optical	 illusion</p>
<p class="calibre1">proceeding	from	the	effects	of	the	afterglow	at	sunset?	It	was	very	bright</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 vivid,	 you	 know,	 and	 the	 reflection	 of	 a	 passing	 cloud	 above	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">horizon	or	its	shadow	just	before	the	sun	dipped	might	have	caused	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	 appearance	 which	 you	 took	 to	 be	 a	 ship	 under	 sail.	 I	 have	 myself been	 often	 mistaken	 in	 the	 same	 way	 under	 similar	 atmospheric</p>
<p class="calibre1">surroundings	and	that	is	why	I	put	it	to	you	like	this,	to	learn	whether	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	quite	certain	you	might	not	be	mistaken?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quite	 so,”	 shoved	 in	 Spokeshave	 again	 in	 his	 parrot	 fashion;	 “quite	 so, sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 didn’t	 ask	 your	 opinion,”	 growled	 the	 skipper,	 shutting	 him	 up	 in	 a twinkling;	 and	 then,	 turning	 to	 me	 again,	 he	 looked	 at	 me	 inquiringly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	Haldane,	have	you	thought	it	out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 captain,	 I	 have,”	 I	 replied	 firmly,	 though	 respectfully,	 the	 ill-timed interference	 of	 the	 objectionable	 Mr	 Spokeshave	 having	 made	 me	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">obstinate	 as	 Mr	 Fosset.	 “It	 was	 no	 optical	 illusion	 or	 imagination	 on	 my part,	 sir,	 or	 anything	 of	 that	 sort,	 I	 assure	 you,	 sir.	 I	 am	 telling	 you	 the truth,	 sir,	 and	 no	 lie.	 I	 saw	 that	 ship,	 sir,	 to	 leeward	 of	 us	 just	 now	 as clearly	as	I	can	see	you	at	this	moment;	aye,	clearer,	sir!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	that	settles	the	matter.	I’ve	never	had	occasion	to	doubt	your	word</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>before	 during	 the	 years	 you’ve	 sailed	 with	 me,	 my	 boy,	 and	 I	 am	 not going	to	doubt	it	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	 saying,	 Captain	 Applegarth,	 putting	 his	 arm	 on	 my	 shoulder,	 faced</p>
<p class="calibre1">round	 towards	 the	 first	 mate	 and	 Spokeshave,	 as	 if	 challenging	 them</p>
<p class="calibre1">both	to	question	my	veracity	after	this	testimony	on	his	part	in	my	favour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	ship,	you	say,	Haldane,”	then	continued	the	skipper,	proceeding	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">interrogate	me	as	to	the	facts	of	the	case,	now	that	my	credulity	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">established,	in	his	sharp,	sailor-like	way,	“was	flying	a	signal	of	distress, </p>
<p class="calibre1">eh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,”	I	answered	with	zest,	all	animation	and	excitement	again	at	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">encouragement.	 “She	 had	 her	 flag,	 the	 French	 tricolour,	 I	 think,	 sir, </p>
<p class="calibre1">hoisted	 half-mast	 at	 her	 peak;	 and	 she	 appeared,	 sir,	 a	 good	 deal</p>
<p class="calibre1">battered	 about,	 as	 if	 she	 had	 been	 in	 bad	 weather	 and	 had	 made	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">worst	of	it.	Besides,	cappen—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	hesitated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Besides	what,	my	boy?”	he	asked,	on	my	pausing	here,	almost	afraid	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">mention	 the	 sight	 I	 had	 noticed	 on	 the	 deck	 of	 the	 ill-fated	 ship	 in	 the presence	 of	 two	 such	 sceptical	 listeners	 as	 Mr	 Fosset	 and	 my	 more</p>
<p class="calibre1">immediate	superior,	the	third	officer,	Spokeshave.	“You	need	not	be	afraid</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	saying	anything	you	like	before	me.  <i class="calibre4">I’m</i>	captain	of	this	ship.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 sir,”	 said	 I,	 speaking	 out,	 “just	 before	 that	 mass	 of	 clouds	 or	 fog bank	came	down	on	the	wind,	shutting	out	the	ship	from	view,	she	yawed</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	bit	off	her	course,	and	I	saw	somebody	on	her	deck	aft.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What!”	cried	the	skipper,	interrupting	me.	“Was	she	so	close	as	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 sir,”	 said	 I.	 “She	 did	 not	 seem	 to	 be	 a	 hundred	 yards	 away	 at	 the moment,	if	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you	saw	somebody	on	the	deck?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	cap’en,”	I	answered;	“a	woman.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	again	interrupted	me,	all	agog	at	the	news. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>“A	woman?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,”	said	I.	“A	woman,	or	rather,	perhaps	a	girl,	for	she	had	a	lot	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">long	hair	streaming	over	her	shoulders,	all	flying	about	in	the	wind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	was	she	doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	appeared	to	be	waving	a	white	handkerchief	or	something	like	that, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	if	to	attract	our	attention—asking	us	to	help	her,	like.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	skipper	drew	himself	up	to	his	full	height	on	my	telling	this	and	turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">round	on	Mr	Fosset,	his	face	blazing	with	passion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	ship	in	distress,	a	woman	on	board	imploring	our	aid,”	he	exclaimed	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">keen,	 cold,	 cutting	 tones	 that	 pierced	 one	 like	 a	 knife,	 “and	 you	 passed her	 by	 without	 rendering	 any	 assistance,—a	 foreigner	 too,	 of	 all.	 We</p>
<p class="calibre1">Englishmen,	 who	 pride	 ourselves	 on	 our	 humanity	 above	 all	 other</p>
<p class="calibre1">nations.	What	will	they	think	of	us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 tell	 you,	 sir,	 we	 could	 not	 see	 any	 ship	 at	 all!”	 retorted	 the	 first	 mate hotly,	in	reply	to	this	reproach,	which	he	felt	as	keenly	as	it	was	uttered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	if	we	couldn’t	see	the	ship,	how	could	we	know	there	was	a	woman</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	anybody	aboard?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quite	 so,”	 echoed	 Spokeshave,	 emphasising	 Mr	 Fosset’s	 logical</p>
<p class="calibre1">argument	in	his	own	defence.	“That’s	exactly	what	I	say,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	would	not	have	had	it	happen	for	worlds.	We	flying	the	old	Union	jack, </p>
<p class="calibre1">too,	that	boasts	of	never	passing	either	friend	or	foe	when	in	danger	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">asking	aid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	spoke	still	more	bitterly,	as	if	he	had	not	heard	their	excuses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	hang	it,	cap’en,”	cried	Mr	Fosset,	“I	tell	you—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Applegarth	waved	him	aside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	 did	 you	 last	 sight	 the	 ship,	 Haldane?”	 he	 said,	 turning	 round</p>
<p class="calibre1">abruptly	to	me.	“How	was	she	heading?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>“She	bore	about	two	points	off	our	port	quarter,”	I	replied	as	laconically.	“I think,	sir,	she	was	running	before	the	wind	like	ourselves,	though	steering</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	little	more	to	the	southwards.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	skipper	looked	at	the	standard	compass	in	front	of	the	wheel-house</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	bridge,	and	then	addressed	the	helmsman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	are	we	steering	now,	quartermaster?	The	same	course	as	I	set	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">noon,	eh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	aye,	sir,”	replied	Atkins,	who	still	stood	by	the	steam	steering	gear</p>
<p class="calibre1">singlehanded.	If	it	had	been	the	ordinary	wheel,	unaided	by	steam-power, </p>
<p class="calibre1">it	would	have	required	four	men	to	move	the	rudder	and	keep	the	vessel</p>
<p class="calibre1">steady	in	such	a	sea	as	was	now	running.	“We’ve	kept	her	pretty	straight, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sir,	since	eight	bells	on	the	same	course,	west	by	south,	sir,	half	south.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very	good,	quartermaster.	Haldane,	are	you	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 sir,”	 said	 I,	 stepping	 up	 to	 him	 again,	 having	 moved	 away	 into	 the shadow	 under	 the	 lee	 of	 the	 wheel-house	 whilst	 he	 was	 speaking	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Atkins.	“Here	I	am,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Was	 that	 vessel	 dropping	 us	 when	 we	 passed	 her,	 or	 were	 we	 going</p>
<p class="calibre1">ahead	of	her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	 was	 running	 before	 the	 wind,	 sir,	 at	 a	 tangent	 to	 our	 course,	 and more	to	the	southwards,	moving	through	the	water	quicker	than	we	were, </p>
<p class="calibre1">until	she	luffed	up	just	before	that	mist	or	fog	bank	shut	her	out	from	view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 think,	 sir,”	 I	 continued,	 “that	 was	 done	 merely	 to	 speak	 us;	 and	 if	 she bore	away	again,	as	she	was	probably	forced	to	do,	being	at	the	mercy	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	gale,	she	must	be	scudding	even	more	to	the	southwards,	almost	due</p>
<p class="calibre1">south,	I	should	fancy,	as	the	wind	has	backed	again	more	to	the	nor’ard</p>
<p class="calibre1">since	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 fancy	 the	 same,	 my	 boy.	 I	 see	 you	 have	 a	 sailor’s	 eye	 and	 have	 got your	wits	about	you.	Quartermaster?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>“Aye,	aye,	sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	her	off	a	point	or	two	gradually	until	you	bring	her	head	about	sou’-</p>
<p class="calibre1">sou’-west,	and	keep	her	so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	aye,	sir,”	responded	Atkins,	easing	her	off	as	required.	“Sou’-sou’-</p>
<p class="calibre1">west	it	shall	be,	sir,	in	a	minute.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 will	 bring	 us	 across	 her,	 I	 think,”	 said	 the	 skipper	 to	 me.	 “But	 we must	go	a	little	faster	if	we	want	to	overtake	her.	What	are	we	doing	now, </p>
<p class="calibre1">eh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 don’t	 quite	 know,	 sir,”	 I	 answered	 to	 this	 question.	 “I	 was	 only	 just coming	 up	 on	 the	 bridge	 to	 relieve	 Mr	 Spokeshave	 when	 I	 sighted	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ship	and	have	not	had	time	to	look	at	the	indicator.	I	should	think,	though, </p>
<p class="calibre1">we’re	going	eight	or	nine	knots.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 didn’t	 satisfy	 the	 skipper,	 so	 he	 turned	 to	 the	 first	 mate,	 who	 had remained	moodily	aloof	with	Spokeshave	at	the	end	of	the	bridge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr	Fosset,”	he	sang	out	abruptly,	“what	are	the	engines	doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About	thirty	revolutions,	sir;	half	speed,	as	nearly	as	possible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	much	are	we	going	altogether?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ten	knots,	with	our	sails,”	replied	the	other.	“The	wind	is	freshening,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	I	see,”	said	Captain	Applegarth	laconically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	it’ll	freshen	still	more	by-and-bye	if	I’m	not	mistaken!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	it	looks	as	if	we’re	going	to	have	a	bit	of	a	blow.	The	scud	is	flying</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	 over	 us	 now	 that	 we	 are	 running	 before	 the	 wind.	 I	 really	 think	 we ought	to	ease	down,	sir,	for	the	screw	races	fearfully	as	she	dips	and	I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">afraid	of	the	shaft.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 responsible	 for	 that,	 Mr	 Fosset,”	 answered	 the	 skipper	 as,	 moving</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 handle	 of	 the	 gong	 on	 the	 bridge	 communicating	 with	 the	 engine-</p>
<p class="calibre1">room,	 he	 directed	 those	 in	 charge	 below	 to	 put	 on	 full	 speed	 ahead.	 “I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>never	yet	abandoned	a	ship	in	distress,	and	I’m	not	going	to	do	so	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’re	on	the	right	course	to	overhaul	her,	now,	I	think,	eh,	Haldane?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,”	I	replied.	“I	hope,	though,	we	won’t	pass	her	in	the	fog,	sir,	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">run	into	her,	perhaps.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	fear	of	that,	my	boy:	The	fog	is	lifting	now	and	the	night	will	soon	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	clear	as	a	bell,	for	the	wind	is	driving	all	the	mists	away.	Besides,	we’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">take	precautions	against	any	accident	happening.	Mr	Fosset?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	aye,	sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Put	a	couple	of	lookouts	on	the	fo’c’s’le.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	aye,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps,	too,	we’d	better	send	up	a	rocket	to	let	’em	know	we’re	about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr	Spokeshave?	Mr	Spokeshave?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	 answer	 came	 this	 time,	 however,	 from	 my	 friend,	 Master	 “Conky,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">though	 he	 had	 been	 ready	 enough	 just	 now	 with	 his	 aggravating	 “quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think,	sir,”	said	I,	“Mr	Spokeshave	has	gone	below	to	his	tea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very	 likely,”	 replied	 the	 skipper	 drily;	 “he’s	 precious	 fond	 of	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">breadbasket,	that	young	gentleman.	I	don’t	think	he’ll	ever	starve	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">there’s	 any	 grub	 knocking	 about.	 Fancy	 a	 fellow,	 calling	 himself	 a	 man, thinking	 of	 his	 belly	 at	 such	 a	 moment!	 Go,	 Haldane,	 and	 call	 him	 up again	and	tell	him	I	want	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 started	 to	 obey	 Captain	 Applegarth’s	 order,	 but	 I	 had	 hardly	 got	 three steps	 down	 the	 ladder	 when	 Spokeshave	 saved	 me	 further	 trouble	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1">coming	 up	 on	 the	 bridge	 again	 of	 his	 own	 accord,	 without	 waiting	 to	 be summoned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	skipper,	therefore,	gave	him	instructions	to	let	off,	every	quarter	of	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">hour,	a	couple	of	signal	rockets	and	burn	a	blue	light	or	two	over	our	port</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	starboard	quarter	alternately	as	we	proceeded	towards	the	object	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	quest. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>“All	 right,	 sir;	 quite	 so!”	 said	 “Conky,”	 as	 well	 as	 he	 could	 articulate,	 his mouth	 being	 full	 of	 something	 he	 had	 hurriedly	 snatched	 from	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">steward’s	 pantry	 when	 he	 had	 gone	 below,	 and	 brought	 up	 with	 him	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">eat	on	deck,	knowing	that	the	skipper	would	be	sure	to	sing	out	for	him	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	remained	long	away	at	so	critical	a	juncture.	“All	right,	sir;	quite	so!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	skipper	laughed	as	he	went	down	again	to	get	the	rockets	and	blue</p>
<p class="calibre1">lights	which	were	kept	in	a	spare	cabin	aft	for	safety. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	a	rum	chap,	that	little	beggar,”	he	observed	to	Mr	Fosset,	who	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	forward	to	set	the	look-out	men	on	the	forecastle	and	had	returned</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	bridge.	“I	think	if	you	told	him	he	was	the	laziest	loafer	that	ever	ate</p>
<p class="calibre1">lobscouse,	he	couldn’t	help	saying	‘Quite	so!’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	about	right,	sir.	I	think,	though,	he	can’t	help	it;	he’s	got	so	used	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 phrase,”	 replied	 the	 other,	 joining	 in	 the	 skipper’s	 laugh.	 “But,	 hullo, here	 comes	 old	 Stokes,	 panting	 and	 puffing	 along	 the	 gangway.	 I	 hope</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing’s	wrong	in	the	engine-room.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 hope	 not,”	 said	 the	 skipper.	 “We	 want	 to	 go	 all	 we	 can	 just	 now,	 to overhaul	that	ship	Haldane	saw.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">If</i>	he	saw	it,”	muttered	the	first	officer,	under	his	breath	and	glowering	at me.	“A	pack	of	sheer	nonsense,	I	call	it,	this	going	out	of	our	course	on	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">wild-goose	chase	and	tearing	away	full	speed	on	a	wild	night	like	this,	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 howling	 sea,	 with	 a	 gale,	 too,	 astern;	 and	 all	 because	 an	 ass	 of	 a youngster	fancies	he	saw	the	 <i class="calibre4">Flying	Dutchman</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 daresay	 the	 captain	 heard	 him,	 but	 the	 appearance	 just	 then	 of	 Mr</p>
<p class="calibre1">Stokes,	our	chief	engineer,	who	had	now	reached	the	bridge,	panting	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">puffing	at	every	step,	as	Mr	Fosset	had	said,	he	being	corpulent	of	habit</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 short-winded,	 stopped	 any	 further	 controversy	 on	 the	 point	 as	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">whether	I	had	seen,	or	had	not	seen,	the	mysterious	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cap’en,	 Cap’en	 Applegarth!”	 cried	 out	 the	 chief	 engineer	 asthmatically</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 soon	 as	 he	 got	 within	 hail,	 speaking	 in	 a	 tearful	 voice	 and	 almost crying	in	his	excitement.	“Are	you	there,	sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	 here	 I	 am,	 Mr	 Stokes,	 as	 large	 as	 life,	 though	 not	 quite	 so	 big	 a man	as	you,”	answered	the	skipper	jocularly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>“I	am	here	on	the	bridge,	quite	at	your	service.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr	Stokes,	however,	was	in	no	jocular	mood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cap’en	Applegarth,”	said	he	solemnly,	“did	you	really	mean	to	ring	us	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">full	speed	ahead?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	did,”	replied	the	skipper	promptly.	“What	of	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 of	 that?”	 repeated	 the	 old	 engineer,	 dumbfounded	 by	 this	 return</p>
<p class="calibre1">shot.	“Why,	sir,	the	engines	can’t	stand	it.	That	is	all,	if	you	must	have	it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can’t	stand	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	can’t	stand	all	this	driving	and	racing,	with	the	propeller	blades	half</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	of	water	every	second	revolution	of	the	shaft.	No	engines	could	stand</p>
<p class="calibre1">it,	with	such	a	heavy	sea	on	and	the	ship	rolling	and	pitching	all	the	time</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	 a	 merry-go-round	 at	 Barnet	 Fair.	 The	 governor	 is	 no	 good;	 and, </p>
<p class="calibre1">though	Grummet	or	Links	have	their	grip	on	the	throttle	valve	all	the	while</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	check	the	steam,	and	I’ve	every	stoker	and	oiler	on	duty,	the	bearings</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	 getting	 that	 heated	 that	 I’m	 afraid	 of	 the	 shaft	 breaking	 at	 any</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment.	Full	speed,	sir?	Why,	we	can’t	do	it,	sir,	we	can’t	do	it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nonsense,	Stokes,”	said	the	skipper	good-humouredly.	“You	must	do	it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">old	fellow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,	 I	 tell	 you,	 Cap’en	 Applegarth,	 the	 engines	 can’t	 stand	 it	 without breaking	down,	and	then	where	will	you	be,	I’d	like	to	know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	risk	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 cap’en,”	 snorted	 the	 old	 chief,	 doggedly.	 “I’m	 responsible	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">owners	for	the	engines,	and	if	anything	happened	to	the	machinery	they’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">blame	me.	I	can’t	do	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	skipper	flew	up	to	white	heat	at	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,	Mr	Stokes,	recollect	I	am	responsible	for	the	ship,	engines	and	all, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sir.	The	greater	includes	the	less,	and,	as	captain	of	this	ship,	I	intend	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 my	 orders	 carried	 out	 by	 every	 man-jack	 on	 board.	 Do	 you	 hear</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,	I	hear,”	replied	Mr	Stokes	grumblingly	as	he	backed	towards	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bridge-ladder.	“But,	sir—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	skipper	would	not	give	him	time	to	get	out	another	word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	heard	what	I	said,”	he	roared	out	in	a	voice	that	made	the	old	chief</p>
<p class="calibre1">jump	 down	 half	 a	 dozen	 steps	 at	 once.	 “I	 ordered	 you	 to	 go	 full	 speed ahead	and	I	mean	to	go	full	speed	ahead	whether	the	boilers	burst,	or	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">propeller	 races,	 or	 the	 screw	 shaft	 carries	 away;	 for	 I	 won’t	 abandon	 a ship	in	distress	for	all	the	engineers	and	half-hearted	mollicoddles	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	 ship	 in	 distress?”	 gasped	 old	 Mr	 Stokes	 from	 the	 bottom	 rung	 of	 the ladder.	“I	didn’t	hear	about	that	before.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 you	 hear	 it	 now,”	 snapped	 out	 the	 skipper	 viciously,	 storming	 up and	down	the	bridge	in	a	state	of	great	wrath.	“But	whether	it’s	a	ship	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">distress	or	not,	I’ll	have	you	to	know,	Mr	Stokes,	once	for	all	that	if	I	order</p>
<p class="calibre1">full	speed	or	half	speed	or	any	speed,	I	intend	my	orders	to	be	obeyed; </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	if	you	don’t	like	it	you	can	lump	it.	I’m	captain	of	this	ship!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Five. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The	Gale	Freshens. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Presently	 a	 cloud	 of	 thick	 black	 smoke	 again	 pouring	 forth	 from	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">funnels	showed	that	Mr	Stokes	had	set	the	engine-room	staff	vigorously</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	work	to	carry	out	the	skipper’s	orders;	while	the	vibration	of	the	upper</p>
<p class="calibre1">deck	 below	 our	 feet	 afforded	 proof,	 were	 such	 needed,	 that	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">machinery	was	being	driven	to	its	utmost	capacity,	the	regular	throbbing</p>
<p class="calibre1">motion	 caused	 by	 the	 revolving	 shaft	 being	 distinctly	 perceptible	 above</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 rolling	 of	 the	 vessel	 and	 the	 jar	 of	 the	 opposing	 waves	 against	 her bow	plates	when	she	pitched	more	deeply	than	usual	and	met	the	sea	full</p>
<p class="calibre1">butt-end	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	surface	fog,	or	mist,	which	had	lately	obscured	the	view,	rising	from</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>the	 water	 immediately	 after	 the	 last	 gleams	 of	 the	 sunset	 had disappeared	from	the	western	sky,	had	now	cleared	away,	giving	place	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	pale	spectral	light	of	night,	an	occasional	star	twinkling	here	and	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 dark	 vault	 overhead,	 like	 a	 sign-post	 in	 the	 immensity	 of	 space, making	the	wild	billowy	waste,	through	which	we	tore	with	all	the	power	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">wind	and	steam,	seem	all	the	wilder	from	contrast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 had	 carried	 on	 like	 this	 for	 about	 an	 hour,	 steering	 steadily	 to	 the southwards,	 without	 catching	 sight	 again	 of	 the	 strange	 ship,	 though</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spokeshave	 and	 I	 had	 continued	 to	 let	 off	 signal	 rockets	 and	 burn	 blue lights	 at	 intervals,	 the	 gale	 increasing	 in	 force	 each	 instant,	 and	 the waves	growing	bigger	and	bigger,	so	that	they	rose	over	the	topsail	as	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">raced	 along,	 when,	 all	 at	 once,	 a	 great	 green	 sea	 broke	 amidships, </p>
<p class="calibre1">coming	aboard	of	us	just	abaft	of	the	engine-room	hatchway,	flooding	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 waist	 on	 either	 side	 of	 the	 deckhouse	 and	 rolling	 down	 below	 in	 a regular	cataract	of	tumid	water,	sweeping	everything	before	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	pretty	lively,”	exclaimed	Captain	Applegarth,	clutching	hold	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rail	 to	 preserve	 his	 balance	 as	 he	 turned	 to	 the	 quartermaster	 at	 the wheel.	“Steady	there,	my	man!	Keep	her	full	and	by!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	 aye,	 sir,”	 answered	 Atkins.	 “But	 she	 do	 yaw	 so,	 when	 she	 buries her	bows.	She’s	got	too	much	sail	on	her,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	that,”	said	the	skipper.	“But	I’m	going	to	carry	on	as	long	as	I	can, </p>
<p class="calibre1">all	the	same,	my	man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	 as	 he	 spoke,	 however,	 a	 second	 sea	 followed	 the	 first,	 nearly</p>
<p class="calibre1">washing	us	all	off	the	bridge,	and	smashing	the	glass	of	the	skylight	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	engine-room,	besides	doing	other	damage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	Captain	Applegarth’s	directions,	a	piece	of	heavy	tarpaulin	was	lashed</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	 the	 broken	 skylight,	 securing	 the	 ends	 to	 ringbolts	 in	 the	 deck;	 but hardly	 had	 the	 covering	 been	 made	 fast	 ere	 we	 could	 see	 the	 chief</p>
<p class="calibre1">engineer	 picking	 his	 way	 towards	 us,	 struggling	 through	 the	 water	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	lay	a	foot	deep	in	the	waist	and	looking	as	pale	as	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hullo,	 Mr	 Stokes,”	 cried	 the	 skipper,	 when	 the	 old	 chief	 with	 great</p>
<p class="calibre1">difficulty	had	gained	the	vantage	of	the	bridge-ladder.	“What’s	the	matter</p>
<p class="calibre1">now,	old	fellow?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>He	was	too	much	exhausted	at	first	to	reply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	the	matter?”	he	echoed	ironically	when	able	at	last	to	speak.	“Oh, </p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing	at	all	worth	mentioning;	nothing	at	all.	I	told	you	how	it	would	be, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sir,	 if	 you	 insisted	 on	 going	 ahead	 full	 speed	 in	 such	 weather	 as	 we’re having!	 Why,	 Cap’en	 Applegarth,	 the	 stoke-hold’s	 full	 of	 water	 and	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bilgepump’s	choked,	that’s	all;	and	the	fires,	I	expect,	will	be	drowned	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	another	minute	or	two.	That’s	what’s	the	matter,	sir,	believe	me	or	not!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	that	the	poor	old	chap,	who	was	quite	overcome	with	the	exertions</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 had	 gone	 through	 and	 his	 pent-up	 emotion,	 broke	 down	 utterly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">bursting	into	a	regular	boohoo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dear	 me,	 Mr	 Stokes;	 Mr	 Stokes,	 don’t	 give	 way	 like	 that,”	 said	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">skipper	 soothingly,	 patting	 him	 on	 the	 back	 to	 calm	 him	 down,	 being	 a very	 good-hearted	 man	 at	 bottom,	 in	 spite	 of	 his	 strict	 discipline	 and insistence	on	being	“captain	of	his	own	ship,”	as	he	termed	it.	“Don’t	give</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	like	that,	old	friend!	Things	will	come	all	right	by-and-bye.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“O-o-h,	will	they?”	snivelled	the	old	chap,	refusing	to	be	comforted,	like	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">veritable	 Rachel	 mourning	 for	 her	 children.	 “We	 may	 possibly	 get	 rid	 of the	 water	 below,	 but	 the	 crosshead	 bearings	 are	 working	 loose,	 and	 I’d like	to	know	who’s	going	to	give	me	a	new	gudgeon	pin?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hang	your	gudgeon	pin!”	cried	the	skipper	irascibly,	not	perhaps	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment	attaching	the	importance	it	demanded	to	this	small	but	essential</p>
<p class="calibre1">part	of	the	engines,	uniting	the	connecting	rod	of	the	crank	shaft	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">piston	which	he	thus	irreverently	anathematised;	and	then,	struck	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">comic	 aspect	 of	 the	 situation,	 with	 the	 waves	 breaking	 over	 us	 and	 the elements	in	mad	turmoil	around	us,	while	the	fat	old	chief	was	blubbering</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	like	a	boy	about	his	gudgeon	pin	as	if	bewailing	some	toy	that	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	taken	from	him,	that	he	burst	out	with	a	roar	of	laughter,	which	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	 contagious	 that,	 in	 spite	 of	 the	 gloomy	 outlook	 and	 our	 perilous</p>
<p class="calibre1">surroundings,	 Mr	 Fosset	 and	 all	 of	 us	 on	 the	 bridge	 joined	 in,	 even	 the quartermaster	 not	 being	 able	 to	 prevent	 a	 grin	 from	 stealing	 over	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">crusty	weatherbeaten	face,	though	the	man	at	the	wheel	on	board	ship, </p>
<p class="calibre1">when	on	duty,	is	technically	supposed	to	be	incapable	of	expressing	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">emotion	 beyond	 such	 as	 may	 be	 connected	 with	 the	 compass	 card	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 coursing	 of	 the	 ship.	 “Wha—wha—what’s	 the	 matter	 with	 that	 now, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>old	chap?	One	would	think	it	was	a	whale	and	not	a	gudgeon,	you	make such	a	fuss	about	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	 course	 the	 captain’s	 joke	 set	 us	 all	 off	 cackling	 again;	 Mr</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spokeshave’s	 “he-he-he”	 sounding	 out,	 high	 in	 the	 treble,	 above	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">general	cachination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	exasperated	Mr	Stokes,	making	the	old	fellow	quite	furious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 is	 no	 laughing	 matter,	 Cap’en	 Applegarth,”	 said	 he	 with	 great</p>
<p class="calibre1">dignity,	standing	up	as	erectly	as	he	could	and	puffing	his	corpulent	figure</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	to	such	an	extent	that	I	thought	he	would	burst.	“I’ll	have	ye	to	know</p>
<p class="calibre1">that,	sir.	Nor	did	I	come	on	deck,	sir,	at	the	peril	of	my	life	almost,	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">made	a	jeer	block	of,	though	I’m	only	the	chief	engineer	of	the	ship	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’re	the	ca’p’en.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	spoke	with	so	stately	an	air	that	I	confess	I	felt	sorry	I	had	given	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 any	 merriment	 at	 his	 expense,	 while	 the	 others	 grew	 serious	 in	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment;	 and	 as	 for	 Atkins,	 his	 whilom	 grinning	 face	 seemed	 now	 to	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">carved	 out	 of	 some	 species	 of	 wood	 of	 a	 particularly	 hard	 and	 fibrous nature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,	 don’t	 get	 angry,	 Stokes,	 old	 fellow,”	 cried	 the	 skipper	 shoving	 out his	fist	and	gripping	that	of	the	chief	in	the	very	nick	of	time,	for	the	vessel</p>
<p class="calibre1">gave	a	lurch	just	then	and,	still	“standing	on	his	dignity,”	as	the	poor	old</p>
<p class="calibre1">chap	 was,	 without	 holding	 on	 to	 anything,	 he	 would	 have	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">precipitated	over	the	rail	to	the	deck	below,	but	for	the	skipper’s	friendly</p>
<p class="calibre1">aid.	“Don’t	be	angry	with	me,	old	chum.	I’m	sorry	I	laughed;	but	you	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	been	shipmates	too	long	together	for	us	to	fall	out	now.	Why,	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 devil	 has	 got	 over	 you,	 Stokes?	 You’ve	 never	 been	 so	 huffy	 since	 I first	sailed	with	you,	and	I	should	have	thought	you	one	of	the	last	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world	to	take	offence	at	a	little	bit	of	harmless	chaff.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	well,	Cap’en	Applegarth,	let	it	bide,	let	it	bide,”	replied	the	old	chief, coming	round	at	once,	his	rage	calming	down	as	quickly	as	it	had	risen.	“I</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t	 mind	 your	 laughing	 at	 me	 if	 you	 have	 a	 mind	 too.	 I	 daresay	 it	 all seemed	very	funny	to	you,	my	being	anxious	about	my	engines,	but	I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">hanged	if	I	can	see	the	fun	myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 it	 was	 funny,	 Stokes;	 deuced	 funny,	 I	 tell	 you,	 ‘ho-ho-ho!’”	 rejoined</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>the	skipper,	bursting	out	into	a	regular	roar	again	at	the	recollection	of	the scene,	 his	 jolly	 laugh	 causing	 even	 the	 cause	 of	 it	 to	 smile	 against	 his will.	“However,	there’s	an	end	of	it,	gudgeon	pin	and	all.	Now,	about	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">stoke-hold	of	yours.	It’s	flooded,	you	say?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye;	 there’s	 eighteen	 inches	 of	 water	 there	 now,	 right	 up	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">footplates,”	 said	 the	 engineer	 with	 a	 grave	 air.	 “The	 bilge-pumps	 won’t act,	 and	 all	 my	 staff	 of	 stokers	 are	 so	 busy	 keeping	 up	 the	 steam	 that	 I can’t	spare	a	man	to	see	to	clearing	out	the	suctions,	though	if	the	water</p>
<p class="calibre1">rises	 any	 higher,	 it	 will	 soon	 be	 up	 to	 the	 furnace	 bars	 and	 put	 out	 the fires.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Humph,	that’s	serious,”	answered	the	skipper	meditatively.	“I’ll	see	what	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	do	to	help	you.	I	say,	Fosset?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	aye,	sir!	Want	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	replied	the	skipper.	“Mr	Stokes	is	shorthanded	below	and	says	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bilge-pumps	are	choked.	Can	you	spare	him	a	man	or	two	to	help	clear</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 suctions?	 I	 daresay	 there’s	 a	 lot	 of	 stray	 dunnage	 washing	 about</p>
<p class="calibre1">under	 the	 stoke-hold	 plates.	 You	 might	 go	 down	 and	 bear	 a	 hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">yourself,	as	I	won’t	leave	the	bridge.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly,	 sir;	 I’ll	 go	 at	 once	 with	 Mr	 Stokes	 and	 take	 some	 of	 the starboard	watch	with	me.	It’s	close	on	seven	bells	and	they’d	soon	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	turn	out,	anyway,	to	relieve	the	men	now	on	deck.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’ll	do	very	well,	Fosset,”	said	the	skipper,	and,	raising	his	voice,	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">shouted	over	the	rail	forwards—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bosun,	call	the	watch!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bill	 Masters,	 who	 had	 been	 waiting	 handy	 on	 the	 deck	 amidships, </p>
<p class="calibre1">immediately	below	the	bridge,	expecting	some	such	order	with	the	need, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 he	 thought,	 of	 the	 skipper	 reducing	 sail,	 at	 once	 stuck	 his	 shrill boatswain’s	pipe	to	his	lips	and	gave	the	customary	call:	Whee-ee-oo-oo</p>
<p class="calibre1">—whee-ee-ee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Starboard	watch,	ahoy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>The	 men	 came	 tumbling	 out	 of	 the	 fo’c’s’le	 at	 the	 sound	 of	 the	 whistle and	the	old	seadog’s	stentorian	hail;	whereupon	the	first	mate,	selecting</p>
<p class="calibre1">six	 of	 the	 lot	 to	 accompany	 him,	 he	 followed	 Mr	 Stokes	 towards	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">engine-room	hatchway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	disappearing	below,	however,	the	engineer	made	a	last	appeal	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	skipper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 say,	 cap’en,”	 he	 sang	 out,	 stopping	 half-way	 as	 he	 toddled	 aft, </p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhat	disconsolately	in	spite	of	the	assistance	given	him,	“now	won’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	ease	down,	sir,	just	to	oblige	me?	The	engines	won’t	stand	it,	sir;	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">it’s	my	duty	to	tell	you	so,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	 right,	 Stokes;	 you’ve	 told	 me,	 and	 may	 consider	 that	 you’ve	 done</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	 duty	 in	 doing	 so,”	 replied	 the	 skipper,	 grimly	 laconic.	 “But	 I’m	 not going	to	ease	down	till	seven	bells,	my	hearty,	unless	we	run	across	Dick</p>
<p class="calibre1">Haldane’s	 ship	 before,	 when	 we’ll	 go	 as	 slow	 as	 you	 like	 and	 bear	 up again	on	our	course	to	the	westwards.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very	good,	sir,”	answered	the	old	chief	as	he	lifted	his	podgy	legs	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 coaming	 of	 the	 hatchway,	 prior	 to	 burying	 himself	 in	 the	 cimmerian darkness	 of	 the	 opening,	 wherein	 Mr	 Fosset	 and	 his	 men	 had	 already</p>
<p class="calibre1">vanished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	 make	 things	 all	 snug	 below,	 sir,	 and	 bank	 the	 fires	 as	 soon	 as	 you give	the	signal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	that,	he,	too,	was	lost	to	sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	skipper,	I	could	see,	was	not	very	easy	in	his	mind	when	left	alone; </p>
<p class="calibre1">for	he	paced	jerkily	to	and	fro	between	the	wheel-house	and	the	weather</p>
<p class="calibre1">end	of	the	bridge	as	well	as	he	was	able,	the	vessel	being	very	unsteady, </p>
<p class="calibre1">rolling	 about	 among	 the	 big	 rollers	 like	 a	 huge	 grampus	 and	 pitching</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost	 bows	 under	 water	 sometimes,	 though	 the	 old	 barquey	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">buoyant	enough,	notwithstanding	the	lot	of	deadweight	she	carried	in	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">bowels,	rising	up	after	each	plunge	as	frisky	as	a	cork,	when	she	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">shake	herself	with	a	movement	that	made	her	tremble	all	over,	as	if	to	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">rid	of	the	loose	spray	and	spindrift	that	hung	on	to	her	shining	black	head, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 which	 the	 wind	 swept	 before	 it	 like	 flecks	 of	 snow	 into	 the	 rigging, spattering	and	spattering	against	the	almost	red-hot	funnels	up	which	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>steam	blast	was	rushing	mingled	with	the	flare	of	the	funnels	below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	continuing	his	restless	walk	for	a	minute	or	two,	the	skipper	stopped</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	 the	 binnacle,	 looking	 at	 the	 compass	 card,	 which	 moved	 about	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">restlessly	as	the	old	barquey	and	himself,	oscillating	in	every	direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 ought	 to	 have	 come	 up	 with	 her	 by	 now,	 Haldane,”	 he	 said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">addressing	 me,	 as	 I	 stood	 with	 Spokeshave	 on	 the	 other	 side	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wheel-house.	 “Don’t	 you	 think	 so	 from	 the	 course	 she	 was	 going	 when</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	sighted	her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,”	I	answered,	“if	she	hasn’t	gone	down!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hope	not,	my	boy,”	said	he;	“but	I’m	very	much	afraid	she	has,	or	else</p>
<p class="calibre1">we’ve	passed	ahead	of	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	not	likely,	sir,”	I	replied.	“She	looked	as	if	crossing	our	track	when	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">last	saw	her;	and,	though	we	were	going	slower	then,	we	must	be	gaining</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	her	now,	I	should	think.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 ought	 to	 be,”	 said	 he.	 “We	 must	 be	 going	 seventeen	 knots	 at	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">least	with	wind	and	steam.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	aye,	sir,	all	that,”	corroborated	old	Masters,	the	boatswain,	who	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">come	up	on	the	bridge	unnoticed.	“Beg	pardon,	sir,	but	we	can’t	carry	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	longer	with	all	that	sail	forrad.	The	fore-topmast	is	a-complainin’	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">anythink,	 I	 can	 tell	 ye,	 sir.	 Chirvell,	 the	 carpenter,	 and	 me’s	 examinin’	 it and	we	thinks	it’s	got	sprung	at	the	cap,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	that’s	the	case,	my	man,”	said	Captain	Applegarth	to	this,	“we’d	better</p>
<p class="calibre1">take	in	sail	at	once.	It’s	a	pity,	too,	with	such	a	fine	wind.	I	was	just	going</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	spare	the	engines	and	ease	down	for	a	bit,	trusting	to	our	sails	alone, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 if	 there’s	 any	 risk	 of	 the	 spars	 going,	 as	 you	 say,	 wrong,	 we	 must reduce	our	canvas	instead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	no	help	for	it,	sir,”	returned	the	boatswain	quickly.	“Either	one	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">t’other	must	go!	Shall	I	pass	the	word,	sir,	to	take	in	sail?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	take	in	the	rags!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>“Fo’c’s’le,	 ahoy	 there!”	 yelled	 Masters	 instantly,	 taking	 advantage	 of	 the long-desired	permission.	“All	hands	take	in	sail!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 had	 hauled	 the	 trysails	 and	 other	 fore	 and	 aft	 canvas,	 which	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">comparatively	useless	to	a	steamer	when	running	before	the	wind	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	 we	 had	 altered	 course	 towards	 the	 south,	 in	 quest	 of	 the	 ship	 in distress,	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Star	 of	 the	 North</i>	 speeding	 along	 with	 only	 her	 fore-topsail and	 fore-topgallantsail	 set	 in	 addition	 to	 her	 fore-topmast	 staysail	 and mizzen	staysail	and	jib. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 gale,	 however,	 had	 increased	 so	 much,	 the	 wind	 freshening	 as	 it</p>
<p class="calibre1">shifted	more	and	more	to	the	north	that	this	sail	was	too	much	for	her,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">canvas	 bellying	 out,	 and	 the	 upper	 spars	 “buckling”	 as	 the	 vessel</p>
<p class="calibre1">laboured	in	the	heavy	sea,	the	stays	taut	as	fiddle-strings	and	everything</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	the	utmost	tension. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	skipper	perceived	this	now,	when	almost	too	late. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	 go	 your	 topgallant	 bowline,	 and	 lee	 sheet	 and	 halliards,”	 he	 roared out,	 holding	 on	 with	 both	 hands	 to	 the	 rail	 and	 bending	 over	 the	 bridge cloth	 as	 he	 shouted	 to	 the	 men	 forward	 who	 had	 tumbled	 out	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">forecastle	on	the	boatswain’s	warning	hail.	“Stand	by	your	clewlines	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	your	boat	lines!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	men	sprang	to	the	ropes	with	a	will,	but	ere	they	had	begun	to	cast</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	 off	 from	 the	 cleats	 an	 ominous	 sound	 was	 heard	 from	 aloft,	 and, </p>
<p class="calibre1">splitting	from	clew	to	earring,	our	poor	topgallantsail	blew	clean	out	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">boltropes	with	a	loud	crack	as	if	a	gun	had	been	fired	off,	the	fragments</p>
<p class="calibre1">floating	 away	 ahead	 of	 us,	 borne	 on	 the	 wings	 of	 the	 wind	 like	 a	 huge kite,	 until	 it	 disappeared	 in	 the	 dark	  <i class="calibre4">chiaraoscura</i>	 of	 the	 distant	 horizon, where	heaven	and	sea	met	amid	the	shadows	of	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	then	a	most	wonderful	thing	happened	to	startle	us	further! </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	all	of	us	gazed	at	the	wreck	aloft,	expecting	the	topsail	to	follow	suit</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	it	could	be	pulled,	though	the	hands	were	racing	up	rigging	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">purpose,	the	halliards	having	been	at	once	let	go	and	the	yard	lowered,	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">strange	light	over	the	topsail	made	us	look	aft,	when	we	saw	a	huge	ball</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	fire	pass	slowly	across	the	zenith	from	the	east	to	the	west,	illuminating</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 only	 the	 northern	 arc	 of	 the	 sky,	 but	 the	 surface	 of	 the	 water	 also, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>immediately	 beneath	 its	 path,	 and	 making	 the	 faces	 of	 the	 men	 in	 the rigging	 and	 indeed	 any	 object	 on	 board,	 stand	 out	 in	 relief,	 shining	 with that	corpse-like	glare	or	reflection	produced	by	the	electric	light,	the	effect</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	weird	and	unearthly	in	the	extreme! </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 the	 same	 instant	 one	 of	 the	 lookouts	 in	 the	 bows	 who	 had	 still</p>
<p class="calibre1">remained	 at	 his	 post	 and	 had	 probably	 been	 awakened	 from	 a	 quiet</p>
<p class="calibre1">“caulk”	by	the	awful	portent,	suddenly	shouted	out	in	a	ringing	voice,	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">thrilled	through	every	heart	on	board—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sail	ho!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Applegarth	and	the	rest	of	us	on	the	bridge	faced	round	again	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	away,	where	away,	my	man?”	cried	the	skipper	excitedly.	“Where</p>
<p class="calibre1">away?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right	 ahead	 of	 us,	 sir,”	 replied	 the	 man	 in	 an	 equally	 eager	 tone.	 “And not	half	a	cable’s	length	away!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	 God!”	 exclaimed	 old	 Masters,	 the	 boatswain,	 whose	 grey	 hair</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	 to	 stand	 on	 end	 with	 terror	 as	 we	 all	 now	 looked	 in	 the	 new</p>
<p class="calibre1">direction	 indicated	 and	 saw	 a	 queer	 ghost-like	 craft	 gliding	 along</p>
<p class="calibre1">mysteriously	in	the	same	direction	as	ourselves,	and	so	close	alongside</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	I	could	have	chucked	a	biscuit	aboard	her	without	any	difficulty.	“That</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	 be	 no	 mortal	 vessel	 that	 ever	 sailed	 the	 seas.	 Mark	 my	 words, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cap’en	 Applegarth,	 that	 there	 craft	 be	 either	  <i class="calibre4">The	 Flying	 Dutchman</i>,	 as I’ve	 often	 heard	 tell	 on,	 but	 never	 seen	 meself,	 or	 a	 ghost-ship;	 and—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord	help	us—we	be	all	doomed	men!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Six. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A	Chapter	of	Accidents. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nonsense,	man!”	cried	Captain	Applegarth.	“Don’t	make	such	an	ass	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">yourself!  <i class="calibre4">Flying	 Dutchman</i>	 indeed!	 Why,	 that	 cock	 and	 bull	 yarn	 was exploded	 years	 ago,	 and	 I	 didn’t	 think	 there	 was	 a	 sailor	 afloat	 in	 the present	day	ass	enough	to	believe	in	this	story!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 may	 be	 a	 hass,	 sir;	 I	 know	 I	 am	 sometimes,”	 retorted	 old	 Masters, evidently	 aggrieved	 by	 the	 skipper	 speaking	 to	 him	 like	 this	 before	 the men.	 “But,	 sir,	 seein’	 is	 believin’.	 There’s	 this	 ship	 an’	 there’s	 that	 there craft	a-sailin’	alongside	in	the	teeth	o’	the	gale.	Hass	or	no	hass,	I	sees</p>
<p class="calibre1">that,	captain!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hang	it	all,	man,	can’t	you	see	that	it	is	only	the	mirage	or	reflection	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	own	vessel,	produced	by	the	light	of	the	meteor	throwing	her	shadow</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	to	the	mass	of	cloud	leeward?	Look,	there	are	our	two	old	sticks	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	funnels	between,	with	the	smoke	rushing	out	of	them!	Aye,	and	there, </p>
<p class="calibre1">too,	you	can	see	this	very	bridge	here	we’re	standing	on,	and	all	of	us,	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">large	as	life.	Why,	bo’sun,	you	can	see	your	own	ugly	mug	reflected	now</p>
<p class="calibre1">opposite	us,	just	as	it	would	be	in	a	looking	glass.	Look,	man!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	I	sees,	sir,	plain	enuff,	though	I’m	a	hass,”	said	Masters	at	length. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	it	ain’t	nat’rel,	sir,	anyhow;	an’	I	misdoubts	sich	skeary	things.	I	ain’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	to	sea	forty	years	for	nothin’,	Captain	Applegarth,	an’	I	fears	sich	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sight	as	that	betokens	some	danger	ahead	as	’ill	happen	to	us	some	time</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	other	this	voyage.	Even	started	on	a	Friday,	sir,	as	you	knows	on,	sir!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rubbish!”	cried	the	skipper,	angry	at	his	obstinacy.	“See,	the	mirage	has</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappeared	 now	 that	 the	 meteor	 light	 has	 become	 dispersed.	 Look</p>
<p class="calibre1">smart	there,	aloft,	and	furl	that	topsail!	It’s	just	seven	bells	and	I’m	going</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	ease	down	the	engines	and	bear	up	on	our	course	again.	Up	with	you, </p>
<p class="calibre1">men,	and	lay	out	on	the	yard!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	hands	who	had	stopped	half-way	up	the	fore-rigging,	spell-bound	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 sight	 of	 the	 mirage,	 now	 bestirred	 themselves,	 shaking	 off	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1">superstitious	fears;	old	Masters,	in	the	presence	of	something	to	be	done, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>also	 working,	 and	 soon	 the	 sail	 was	 furled,	 the	 bunt	 stowed,	 and	 the gaskets	passed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	no	use	our	keeping	on	any	longer	after	that	ship	of	yours,	Haldane,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">observed	the	skipper,	turning	to	me	when	the	men	had	all	come	in	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 topsail	 yard	 and	 scrambled	 down	 on	 deck	 again	 after	 making</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything	 snug	 aloft.	 “If	 she	 were	 still	 afloat	 we	 must	 have	 overhauled her	before	this.	I	really	think,	youngster,	she	must	have	been	only	a	sort</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	will-o’-the-wisp,	like	that	we	saw	just	now—an	optical	illusion,	as	I	told</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	at	the	time,	recollect,	caused	by	some	cross	light	from	the	afterglow</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	sunset	thrown	upon	the	white	mist	which	we	noticed	subsequently</p>
<p class="calibre1">rising	off	the	water.	Eh,	my	boy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	 no,	 captain,”	 I	 replied	 earnestly.	 “The	 ship	 I	 saw	 presented	 a	 very different	appearance	to	that	reflection	of	ours!  <i class="calibre4">She</i>	was	full-rigged,	I	told you,	 sir,	 and	 though	 her	 canvas	 was	 torn	 and	 she	 looked	 a	 bit	 knocked about	 in	 the	 matter	 of	 her	 tophamper,	 she	 was	 as	 unlike	 our	 old	  <i class="calibre4">Star	 of</i> <i class="calibre4">the	North</i>	as	a	sailing	vessel	is	unlike	a	steamer!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	might	have	been	a	derelict.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	saw	a	girl	on	her	deck	aft,	sir,	with	a	dog	beside	her,	as	distinctly	as	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	you,	sir,	now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	well,	be	that	as	it	may,	my	lad,	though	I’m	very	sorry	for	the	poor</p>
<p class="calibre1">young	thing,	if	she	is	still	in	the	land	of	the	living,	I	can’t	carry	on	like	this for	ever!	If	she	were	anywhere	in	sight	it	would	be	quite	another	matter; </p>
<p class="calibre1">but,	as	it	is,	not	knowing	whether	we’re	on	her	right	track	or	not,	we	might</p>
<p class="calibre1">scud	 on	 to	 the	 Equator	 without	 running	 across	 her	 again.	 No,	 no;	 it</p>
<p class="calibre1">wouldn’t	be	fair	to	the	owners	or	to	ourselves,	indeed,	to	risk	the	ship	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">well	as	the	lives	of	all	on	board	by	continuing	any	longer	on	such	a	wild-</p>
<p class="calibre1">goose	chase.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very	 good,	 sir,”	 said	 I,	 on	 his	 pausing	 here,	 as	 if	 waiting	 for	 me	 to	 say something.	“We’ve	tried	our	best	to	come	up	with	her,	at	any	rate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 have	 that,	 and	 I	 daresay	 a	 good	 many	 would	 call	 us	 foolhardy	 for carrying	 on	 as	 we’ve	 done	 so	 long.	 However,	 I’m	 going	 to	 abandon	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">chase	 now	 and	 bear	 up	 again	 on	 our	 proper	 course,	 my	 boy,	 and	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">devil	of	a	job	that	will	be,	I	know,	in	the	teeth	of	this	gale!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>So	saying,	the	skipper,	grasping	the	handle	of	the	engine-room	telegraph, which	led	up	through	a	tube	at	the	end	of	the	bridge,	signalled	to	those	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">charge	below	to	slow	down	to	half	speed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Down	 with	 the	 helm,	 quartermaster!”	 he	 cried	 to	 the	 man	 at	 the	 wheel, and,	at	the	same	moment	holding	up	his	hand	to	attract	the	attention	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">old	 Masters,	 who	 had	 returned	 to	 his	 station	 on	 the	 fo’c’s’le,	 greatly exercised	 in	 his	 mind	 by	 what	 had	 recently	 occurred,	 he	 sang	 out	 in	 a voice	 of	 thunder	 that	 reached	 the	 knightheads	 and	 made	 the	 boatswain</p>
<p class="calibre1">skip:	 “Haul	 in	 your	 jib	 sheet	 and	 flatten	 those	 staysails	 sharp!	 I	 want	 to bring	 her	 round	 to	 the	 wind	 handsomely,	 to	 prevent	 taking	 in	 another	 of those	green	seas	aboard	when	we	get	broadside-on.	Look	smart,	bo’sun, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	keep	your	eye	on	her.	Keep	your	eye	on	her,	d’you	hear?	It’s	ticklish</p>
<p class="calibre1">work,	you	know.	Look-out	sharp	or	she’ll	broach	to!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Far	 as	 the	 eye	 could	 reach,	 the	 storm-tossed	 surface	 of	 the	 deep	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">white	with	foam,	white	as	a	snowfield,	and	boiling	with	rage	and	fury. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 bank	 of	 blue-black	 cloud	 that	 had	 rested	 along	 the	 horizon	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">leeward	had	now	melted	away	in	some	mysterious	fashion	or	other,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	sky	became	as	clear	as	a	bell,	only	some	wind-driven	scrap	of	semi-</p>
<p class="calibre1">transparent	 white	 vapour	 sweeping	 occasionally	 across	 the	 face	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pale,	sickly-looking	moon	that	looked	down	on	the	weird	scene	in	a	sort</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	menacing	way;	while,	in	lieu	of	the	two	or	three	odd	sentinels	that	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">previously	 peeped	 out	 from	 the	 firmament,	 all	 the	 galaxies	 of	 heaven</p>
<p class="calibre1">were,	 at	 this	 moment,	 in	 their	 myriads	 above,	 spangling	 the	 empyrean</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	zenith	to	pole. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	the	gale! </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	 running	 before	 the	 wind,	 the	 wind,	 although	 it	 had	 ballooned	 our sails	out	to	bursting	point,	brushing	us	along	at	a	wild,	mad-cap	rate,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">buffeting	 the	 boisterous	 billows	 on	 either	 hand,	 scooping	 them	 up	 from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 depths	 of	 the	 ocean	 and	 piling	 them	 in	 immense	 waves	 of	 angry</p>
<p class="calibre1">water	that	rolled	after	us,	striving	to	overwhelm	us,	we	could	hardly,	even</p>
<p class="calibre1">while	taking	advantage	of	it,	appreciate	its	awful	and	tremendous	force. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 coming	 about,	 however,	 and	 facing	 it,	 the	 case	 was	 vastly	 different, the	wind	increasing	tenfold	in	its	intensity. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>Where	it	had	sung	through	the	rigging	it	now	shrieked	and	howled,	as	if the	 air	 were	 peopled	 with	 demons,	 while	 the	 waves,	 lashed	 into	 fury, </p>
<p class="calibre1">dashed	against	our	bows	like	battering	rams,	rising	almost	to	the	level	of</p>

<p class="calibre1">Round	came	the	old	barquey’s	head	slowly,	and	more	slowly	still	as	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">staggered	against	the	heavy	sea,	until,	all	at	once,	she	stopped	in	stays, </p>
<p class="calibre1">unable	 apparently,	 though	 struggling	 all	 she	 could,	 to	 face	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">remorseless	foe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Luff	 up,	 quartermaster!”	 roared	 the	 skipper	 to	 the	 top	 of	 his	 voice	 and dancing	up	and	down	the	bridge	in	his	excitement.	“Luff,	you	beggar,	luff!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t,	sir,”	yelled	the	man	in	desperation—a	fresh	hand	who	had	come</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 duty	 to	 relieve	 Atkins	 at	 six	 bells.	 “The	 steam	 steering	 gear	 has</p>
<p class="calibre1">broken-down,	sir,	and	I	can’t	make	her	move.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	 Jingo,	 that’s	 a	 bad	 job,”	 cried	 the	 skipper,	 but	 he	 was	 not	 long	 at	 a nonplus.	 “Run	 aft,	 Haldane,	 and	 you	 too,	 Spokeshave.	 Loosen	 the	 bunt</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	mizzen-trysail	and	haul	at	the	clew.	That’ll	bring	her	up	to	the	wind</p>
<p class="calibre1">fast	enough,	if	the	sail	only	stands	it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	 hear	 was	 to	 obey,	 and	 both	 Spokeshave	 and	 I	 scuttled	 down	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bridge-ladder	as	quickly	as	we	could	and	away	along	the	waist	of	the	ship</p>
<p class="calibre1">aft,	 the	 urgency	 of	 our	 errand	 hastening	 our	 movements	 if	 we	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">needed	any	spur	beyond	the	skipper’s	sharp,	imperative	mandate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But,	 speedily	 as	 we	 had	 hurried,	 on	 mounting	 the	 poop-ladder	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">rushing	 towards	 the	 bitts	 at	 the	 foot	 of	 the	 mizzenmast	 to	 cast	 off	 the bunt-lines	 and	 clewlines	 of	 the	 trysail	 we	 found	 we	 had	 been	 already</p>
<p class="calibre1">forestalled	by	an	earlier	arrival	on	the	scene	of	action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 was	 Mr	 O’Neil,	 the	 second	 officer,	 whom	 I	 had	 left	 below	 asleep	 in his	cabin	when	I	came	up	at	two	bells	from	the	saloon,	he	having	been	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">duty	 all	 the	 afternoon	 and	 his	 services	 not	 being	 required	 again	 until night,	when	he	would	have	to	go	on	the	bridge	to	take	the	first	watch	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">eight	to	midnight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feeling	 the	 bucketing-about	 we	 were	 having	 in	 the	 trough	 of	 the	 sea</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	we	came	about,	and	probably	awakened	by	the	change	of	motion, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>just	 as	 a	 miller	 is	 supposed	 to	 be	 instantaneously	 roused	 by	 his	 mill stopping,	 though	 he	 may	 be	 able	 to	 sleep	 through	 all	 the	 noise	 of	 its grinding	when	at	work,	Garry	O’Neil	had	at	once	shoved	himself	into	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">boots	 and	 monkey	 jacket	 and	 rushed	 up	 on	 the	 poop	 through	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">companion	and	booby-hatch	that	led	up	directly	on	deck	from	the	saloon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arrived	 here,	 he	 had	 evidently	 noted	 the	 vessel’s	 insecurity,	 and, </p>
<p class="calibre1">seamanlike,	had	hit	upon	the	very	same	way	out	of	the	difficulty	that	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">suggested	itself	to	the	skipper,	having,	ere	we	reached	his	side,	cast	off</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	ropes	confining	the	folds	of	the	trysail	and	trying	singlehanded	to	haul</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	the	clew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Begorrah,	me	bhoys,	ye’ve	come	in	the	very	nick	o’	time!”	he	exclaimed</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	seeing	us.	“Here,	Spoke,	me	darlint,	hang	on	to	the	end	of	this	sheet</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 you,	 Dick,	 step	 on	 to	 the	 tail	 of	 it,	 whilst	 I	 take	 a	 turn	 of	 the	 slack round	that	bollard!	Faith,	it’s	blo’in’	like	the	dievle,	and	we’ll	have	our	work</p>
<p class="calibre1">cut	 out	 for	 us,	 me	 bhoys,	 to	 git	 a	 purchase	 on	 it	 anyhow.	 Now,	 all</p>
<p class="calibre1">together,	yo-heave-ho!	Pull	baker,	pull	dievle!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 that,	 bending	 our	 backs	 to	 it,	 we	 all	 hauled	 away	 at	 the	 sheet, succeeding	by	a	great	endeavour	in	stretching	the	clew	of	the	sail	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">end	 of	 the	 boom,	 which	 we	 then	 secured	 amidships	 as	 best	 we	 could, </p>
<p class="calibre1">though	 the	 spar	 and	 sail	 combined	 jerked	 to	 such	 an	 extent	 that	 it</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	 as	 if	 the	 mizzenmast	 would	 be	 wrenched	 out	 of	 the	 ship	 each</p>
<p class="calibre1">instant,	the	heavy	fold	of	the	canvas	that	hung	loosely	under	the	jaws	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	gaff	shaking	and	banging	about	with	a	noise	like	thunder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	 the	 small	 amount	 of	 canvas	 exposed	 to	 the	 wind,	 however,	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">sufficient	 to	 supply	 the	 additional	 leverage	 required	 aft;	 and	 the	 engines working	at	half	speed,	with	the	headsails	flattened,	the	ship’s	bows	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">presently	brought	up	to	the	wind,	when	we	lay-to	under	easy	steam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well	 done,	 my	 lads!”	 sang	 out	 the	 skipper	 from	 the	 bridge,	 when	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ship’s	 head	 was	 round	 and	 the	 peril	 of	 her	 broaching-to	 in	 the	 heavy</p>
<p class="calibre1">seaway	 been	 fortunately	 averted;	 the	 wind	 was	 blowing	 aft,	 of	 course, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 bringing	 his	 voice	 to	 us	 as	 if	 he	 stood	 by,	 and	 shouting	 in	 our	 very ears,	 “Now	 look	 sharp	 and	 come	 here	 under	 the	 bridge;	 I	 want	 you	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">cast	 off	 the	 lashings	 of	 the	 big	 wheel	 amidships	 and	 see	 that	 the	 yolk lines	 run	 clear.	 We	 shall	 have	 to	 manhandle	 the	 helm	 and	 steer	 from</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>below,	 as	 the	 steam	 gear	 up	 here	 in	 the	 wheel-house	 is	 hopelessly jammed	and	will	take	a	month	of	Sundays	to	get	right!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	aye,	sir,”	we	made	answer,	under	his	nose,	having	been	scurrying</p>
<p class="calibre1">forwards	 while	 he	 was	 speaking,	 the	 Irish	 mate	 adding	 in	 his	 native</p>
<p class="calibre1">vernacular,	 “Begorrah,	 we’ll	 rig	 up	 the	 whole,	 sir,	 in	 the	 twinkling	 of	 a bedpost,	sure!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hullo!”	exclaimed	the	skipper,	“is	that	you,	O’Neil?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith,	all	that’s	lift	of	me,	sir!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How’s	that?—I	was	just	going	to	send	down	to	your	cabin	to	rouse	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Begorrah,	 its	 moighty	 little	 rousin’	 I	 want,	 sor!	 The	 ould	 barquey’s	 that lively	that	she’d	wake	a	man	who’d	been	d’id	for	a	wake,	sure!	I’ve	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	 rowled	 about	 in	 me	 burth	 and	 banged	 agin’	 the	 bulkheads	 that	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">bones	 fell	 loike	 jelly	 and	 I’m	 blue-mouldy	 all	 over.	 But	 what	 d’ye	 want, cap’en?	Sure,	I’m	helping	the	youngster	with	this	whale	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	jingo!”	cried	the	skipper,	“you’re	the	right	man	in	the	right	place!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith,	that’s	what	the	gaolor	s’id	to	the	burghlor,	sor,	when	he	fixed	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	noicely	on	the	treadmill!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	skipper	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	you	fix	up	your	job	all	right,	and	you’ll	be	as	good	as	your	friend	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">gaoler,”	he	said.	“When	we	have	the	helm	all	alaunto	again,	we	can	bear</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	on	our	course	and	jog	along	comfortably.	I	think	we	are	lucky	to	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">got	 off	 so	 lightly,	 considering	 the	 wind	 and	 sea,	 with	 this	 steering	 gear breaking	down	at	such	an	awkward	moment!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	we	ain’t	seed	the	worse	on	it	yet,	and	you’d	better	not	holler	till	ye’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	 o’	 the	 wood!”	 muttered	 old	 Masters	 under	 his	 breath,	 in	 reply	 to	 this expression	 of	 opinion	 of	 the	 skipper,	 the	 boatswain	 having	 come	 to	 our assistance	 with	 all	 the	 hands	 he	 could	 muster,	 so	 as	 to	 get	 the	 wheel below	the	bridge	in	working	order	as	soon	as	possible.	“I	knowed	that	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">ghost-ship	meant	sumkin’	and	we	ain’t	come	to	the	end	o’	the	log	yet!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>Almost	 as	 he	 uttered	 the	 words,	 Mr	 Fosset	 came	 up	 the	 engine-room hatchway	and	made	his	way	hurriedly	towards	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	jingo,	Fosset,	here	you	are	at	last!”	exclaimed	the	skipper	on	seeing</p>
<p class="calibre1">him.	“I	thought	you	were	never	coming	up	again,	finding	it	so	jolly	warm</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	comfortable	below!	Are	things	all	right	there	now,	and	are	the	bilge-</p>
<p class="calibre1">pumps	working?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Applegarth	spoke	jocosely	enough,	everything	being	pretty	easy</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	deck	and	the	ship	breasting	the	gale	like	a	duck,	but	Mr	Fosset’s	face, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 noticed,	 looked	 grave	 and	 he	 answered	 the	 other	 in	 a	 more	 serious</p>
<p class="calibre1">fashion	 than	 his	 general	 wont,	 his	 mouth	 working	 nervously	 in	 the	 pale moonlight	 that	 lent	 him	 a	 more	 pallid	 air	 as	 the	 words	 dropped	 from	 his lips,	making	his	countenance,	indeed,	almost	like	that	of	a	corpse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	what,	 man!”	 exclaimed	 the	 skipper	 impatiently,	 interrupting	 his	 slow speech	before	Mr	Fosset	could	get	any	further.	“Anything	wrong,	eh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 sir,	 I’m	 sorry	 to	 say	 something	 is	 very	 wrong,	 I	 fear—very	 wrong below,”	 replied	 the	 other	 sadly.	 “There	 has	 been	 a	 sad	 accident	 in	 the stoke-hole!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Old	Masters,	whose	ears	had	been	wide	open	to	the	conversation,	here</p>
<p class="calibre1">nudged	 me	 with	 his	 elbow	 as	 I	 stood	 beside	 him,	 and	 at	 the	 same	 time giving	forth	a	grunt	of	deep	and	heartfelt	significance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	knowed	summet	’ud	happen,”	he	whispered	in	a	sepulchral	voice	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">sounded	 all	 the	 more	 gruesome	 from	 the	 attendant	 circumstances,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shrieking	 wind	 tearing	 through	 the	 riggings,	 the	 melancholy	 wash	 of	 the waves	 alongside,	 the	 moaning	 and	 groaning	 of	 the	 poor	 old	 barquey’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">timbers	as	if	she	were	in	grievous	pain,	while	at	that	very	moment	the	bell</p>
<p class="calibre1">under	the	break	of	the	fo’c’s’le	struck	eight	bells	slowly,	as	if	tolling	for	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">passing	soul.	“<i class="calibre4">You</i>	seed	the	ghost-ship,	Mr	Haldane,	the	same	as	me,	for</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I</i>	saw	it,	that	I	did!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Seven. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Disaster	on	Disaster. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>“Accident	in	the	stoke-hold!”	repeated	the	skipper,	who	of	course	did	not overhear	 the	 old	 boatswain’s	 aside	 to	 me.	 “Accident	 in	 the	 stoke-hold!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">again	repeated	the	skipper;	“anybody	hurt?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 sir,”	 replied	 the	 first	 mate	 in	 the	 same	 grave	 tone	 of	 voice.	 “Mr Stokes	and	two	of	the	firemen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Seriously?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	 all,	 sir,”	 said	 the	 other,	 glancing	 round	 as	 if	 looking	 for	 some	 one specially.	 “The	 chief	 engineer	 has	 one	 of	 his	 arms	 broken	 and	 a	 few</p>
<p class="calibre1">scratches,	but	the	firemen	are	both	injured,	and	one	so	badly	hurt	that	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">fear	he	won’t	get	over	it,	for	his	ribs	have	been	crushed	in	and	his	lower</p>
<p class="calibre1">extremities	seem	paralysed!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	heavens!”	exclaimed	the	skipper.	“How	did	the	accident	happen?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	were	searching	under	the	stoke-hold	plates	to	get	out	some	cotton</p>
<p class="calibre1">waste	 that	 had	 got	 entangled	 about	 the	 rosebox	 of	 the	 suctions,	 which, as	 we	 found	 out,	 prevented	 the	 bilge-pumps	 from	 acting,	 when,	 all	 in	 a moment,	just	when	all	the	stray	dunnage	had	been	cleared	out,	the	ship</p>
<p class="calibre1">gave	 a	 lurch	 and	 the	 plates	 buckled	 up,	 catching	 the	 lot	 of	 them,	 Mr Stokes	 and	 all,	 in	 a	 sort	 of	 rat	 trap.	 Mr	 Stokes	 tumbled	 forwards	 on	 his face	 in	 the	 water	 and	 was	 nearly	 drowned	 before	 Stoddart	 and	 I	 could</p>
<p class="calibre1">pull	 him	 out,	 the	 poor	 old	 chap	 was	 so	 heavy	 to	 lift,	 and	 he	 nearly squashed	 Blanchard,	 the	 stoker,	 by	 falling	 on	 top	 of	 him	 as	 we	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying	 to	 raise	 him	 up,	 cutting	 his	 head	 open	 besides,	 against	 the	 fire bars.	 Poor	 Jackson,	 however,	 the	 other	 fireman,	 was	 gripped	 tight</p>
<p class="calibre1">between	 two	 of	 the	 plates	 and	 it	 was	 all	 we	 could	 do	 to	 release	 him, Stoddart	having	to	use	a	jack-saw	to	force	the	edges	of	the	plates	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	 God!	 horrible,	 horrible!”	 ejaculated	 the	 skipper,	 terribly	 upset	 and concerned.	 “Poor	 fellows;	 Jackson,	 too,	 was	 the	 best	 hand	 Stokes	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">below!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	sir,	and	as	good	a	mechanic,	too,	I’ve	heard	them	say,	as	any	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">engineers,”	agreed	Mr	Fosset,	with	equal	feeling.	“But,	sir,	I’m	losing	time</p>
<p class="calibre1">talking	like	this!	I	only	came	up	for	assistance	for	the	poor	fellows	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">others	who	are	wounded.	Where’s	Garry	O’Neil?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>“Why,	 he	 was	 here	 under	 the	 bridge	 a	 moment	 ago,”	 cried	 the	 skipper eagerly.	 “Hullo,	 O’Neil?	 Pass	 the	 word	 up,	 men,	 for	 Mr	 O’Neil.	 He’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted	at	once!	Sharp,	look	alive!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	 second	 officer,	 it	 should	 be	 explained,	 was	 not	 only	 a	 sailor	 but	 a surgeon	as	well.	He	had	run	away	to	sea	as	a	boy,	and,	after	working	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	 up	 before	 the	 mast	 until	 he	 had	 acquired	 sufficient	 seamanship	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">obtain	a	mate’s	certificate,	he	had,	at	his	mother’s	entreaty,	she	having	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">holy	 horror	 of	 salt	 water,	 abandoned	 his	 native	 element	 and	 studied	 for the	 medical	 profession	 at	 Trinity	 College,	 Dublin.	 Here,	 after	 four	 years’</p>
<p class="calibre1">practice	in	walking	the	hospitals,	he	graduated	with	full	honours,	much	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 mother’s	 delight.	 The	 old	 lady,	 however,	 dying	 some	 little	 time	 after, he,	 feeling	 no	 longer	 bound	 by	 any	 tie	 at	 home,	 and	 having	 indeed</p>
<p class="calibre1">sacrificed	 his	 own	 wishes	 for	 her	 sake,	 incontinently	 gave	 up	 his	 newly-fledged	 dignity	 of	 “Doctor”	 Garry	 O’Neil,	 returning	 to	 his	 old	 love	 and embracing	once	more	a	sea-faring	life,	which	he	has	stuck	to	ever	since. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 had	 sailed	 with	 us	 in	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Star	 of	 the	 North</i>	 now	 for	 over	 a twelvemonth,	 in	 the	 first	 instance	 as	 third	 officer	 and	 for	 the	 last	 two voyages	 as	 second	 mate,	 the	 fact	 of	 his	 being	 a	 qualified	 surgeon</p>
<p class="calibre1">standing	 him	 in	 good	 stead	 and	 making	 him	 even	 a	 more	 important</p>
<p class="calibre1">personage	 on	 board	 than	 his	 position	 warranted,	 cargo	 steamers	 not</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	 in	 the	 habit	 of	 carrying	 a	 medical	 man	 like	 passenger	 ships,	 and sailorly	qualities	and	surgical	skill	interchangeable	characteristics! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hitherto	we	had	been	fortunate	enough	to	have	no	necessity	for	availing</p>
<p class="calibre1">ourselves	 of	 his	 professional	 services,	 but	 now	 they	 came	 in	 handy</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough	in	good	sooth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr	O’Neil?”	sang	out	the	men	on	the	lower	deck,	passing	on	his	name	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">obedience	to	the	skipper’s	orders	from	hand	to	hand,	till	the	hail	reached</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	after	hatchway,	down	which	Spokeshave	roared	with	all	the	power	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	lungs,	being	anxious	on	his	own	account	to	be	heard	and	so	released</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 his	 watch	 so	 that	 he	 could	 go	 below.	 “Mr	 O’Neil?”	 he	 again	 yelled out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Spokeshave	must	have	shouted	down	the	Irishman’s	throat,	for	the	next</p>
<p class="calibre1">instant	he	poked	his	head	up	the	hatchway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here	I	am,	bedad!”	he	exclaimed,	shoving	past	Master	“Conky,”	to	whom</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>he	had	a	strong	dislike,	though	“Garry,”	as	we	all	called	him,	was	friendly with	every	one	with	whom	he	was	brought	in	contact,	and	was,	himself,	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">great	 favourite	 with	 all	 the	 hands	 on	 board.	 Now,	 as	 he	 made	 his	 way towards	 the	 bridge,	 where	 some	 of	 the	 men	 were	 still	 singing	 out	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">name,	he	cried	out,	“Who	wants	me,	sure?	Now,	don’t	ye	be	all	spaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	once;	one	at	a	time,	me	darlints,	as	we	all	came	into	the	wurrld!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why,	 where	 did	 you	 get	 to,	 man?”	 said	 the	 skipper,	 somewhat	 crossly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	been	hunting	all	over	the	ship	for	you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,	I	wint	down	into	the	stowage	to	say	if	the	yolklines	and	chains	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 wheel	 were	 all	 clear,	 and	 to	 disconnect	 the	 shtame	 stayrin’	 gear,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">replied	 our	 friend	 Garry.	 “But	 you’ll	 find	 it	 all	 right	 now,	 with	 the	 helm amidships,	and	you	can	steer	her	wheriver	you	like;	only	you’ll	want	four</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands	at	least	to	hauld	the	spokes	steady	if	she	breaks	off,	as	I	fear	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">will,	in	this	say!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 all	 right,”	 cried	 the	 skipper,	 appeased	 at	 once,	 for	 he	 evidently thought	 that	 Garry	 had	 gone	 back	 to	 his	 cabin	 and	 left	 us	 in	 the	 lurch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I’ve	bad	news,	and	sorry	to	say,	O’Neil,	we	want	your	services	as	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">doctor	now.	There’s	been	a	bad	accident	in	the	stoke-hold	and	some	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	poor	fellows	are	sadly	hurt.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Indade,	now!”	ejaculated	the	other,	all	attention.	“What’s	the	matter?	Any</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	scalded	by	the	shtame,	sure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	not	that,”	said	Mr	Fosset,	taking	up	the	tale.	“Mr	Stokes	has	had	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">arm	broken	and	another	poor	fellow	been	almost	crushed	to	death.	He’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	insensible,	or	was	when	I	came	on	deck	so	you’d	better	take	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">stimulant	as	well	as	splints	with	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith,	 I	 understand	 all	 right	 and	 will	 follow	 your	 advice	 in	 a	 brace	 of shakes,”	 replied	 the	 second	 mate,	 as	 he	 rushed	 off	 towards	 the	 saloon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’d	better	go	on	ahead,	Fosset,	and	say	I’m	coming!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 these	 parting	 words	 both	 he	 and	 the	 first	 officer	 disappeared	 from view,	 the	 latter	 hastening	 back	 to	 the	 engine-room,	 while	 the	 captain</p>
<p class="calibre1">slowly	 mounted	 the	 bridge-ladder	 again	 and	 resumed	 his	 post	 there	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	binnacle,	after	placing	four	of	the	best	hands	at	the	wheel	amidships</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	old	Masters,	the	boatswain,	in	charge. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>“Ah,	 what	 d’ye	 think	 o’	 that	 now?”	 observed	 the	 latter	 to	 me,	 as	 I	 stood there	 awaiting	 my	 orders	 from	 the	 skipper,	 or	 to	 hear	 anything	 he	 might have	 to	 say	 to	 me.	 “I	 said	 as	 how	 summut	 was	 sure	 to	 happen.	 That</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	ship—the	ghost-ship—didn’t	come	athwart	our	hawser	for	nothink,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowed!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	then	there	was	a	call	up	the	voicepipe	communicating	between	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wheel-house	on	the	bridge	and	the	engine-room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	skipper	bent	his	ear	to	the	pipe,	listening	to	what	those	below	had	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">say,	and	then	came	to	the	top	of	the	ladder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Below	there!”	he	sang	out.	“Is	Mr	Spokeshave	anywhere	about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	sir,”	I	answered.	“He	went	off	duty	at	eight	bells.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 devil	 he	 did,	 and	 me	 in	 such	 a	 plight,	 too,	 with	 that	 awful	 accident below!”	 cried	 Captain	 Applegarth	 angrily.	 “I	 suppose	 he’s	 thinking	 of	 his belly	again,	the	gourmandising	little	beast!	He	isn’t	half	a	sailor	or	worth	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">purser’s	 parings!	 I’ll	 make	 him	 pay	 for	 his	 skulking	 presently,	 by	 Jingo! </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,	 I	 can’t	 waste	 the	 time	 now	 to	 send	 after	 him,	 and	 you’ll	 do	 as well,	Haldane—better,	indeed,	I	think!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	sir,”	said	I,	eager	for	action.	“I’m	ready	to	do	anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	a	willing	lad,”	cried	the	skipper.	“Now	run	down	into	Garry	O’Neil’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">cabin	and	get	some	lint	bandages	he	says	he	forgot	to	take	with	him	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 hurry,	 leaving	 them	 on	 the	 top	 of	 his	 bunk	 by	 the	 doorway;	 and	 tell Weston,	 the	 steward,	 to	 have	 a	 couple	 of	 spare	 bunks	 ready	 for	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">injured	men—in	one	of	the	state	rooms	aft	will	be	best.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	 right,	 sir,”	 said	 I,	 adding,	 as	 he	 seemed	 to	 hesitate,	 “anything	 else, sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	my	boy;	take	down	a	loose	hammock	with	you,	and	some	lashings, </p>
<p class="calibre1">so	as	to	make	a	sort	of	net	with	which	to	lift	and	carry	poor	Jackson.	He’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 only	 chap	 badly	 hurt	 and	 unable	 to	 shift	 for	 himself,	 so	 O’Neil	 says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Look	sharp,	Haldane,	there’s	no	time	to	lose;	the	poor	fellow’s	in	a	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">ticklish	state	and	they	want	to	get	him	up	on	deck	in	order	to	examine	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">injuries	better	than	they	can	below	in	the	stoke-hold!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>“Aye,	 aye,	 sir!”	 I	 answered,	 darting	 aft	 immediately,	 to	 avoid	 further debation,	towards	the	saloon	door	under	the	poop.	“I’m	 <i class="calibre4">off</i>,	sir,	at	once!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here	 I	 soon	 got	 what	 the	 Irishman	 had	 asked	 for	 out	 of	 his	 cabin,	 and, giving	 Weston	 his	 order	 about	 the	 state	 room,	 unslinging	 the	 while	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">own	hammock	from	its	hooks	and	rolling	it	up,	blankets	and	all,	in	a	roll,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">kicked	it	before	me	as	I	made	my	way	down	the	engine-room	hatchway</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	quickly	as	I	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	machinery,	I	noticed	when	passing	through	the	flat	to	the	stoke-hold, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which	 was,	 of	 course,	 on	 a	 still	 lower	 level,	 was	 working	 away	 pretty easily,	 the	 piston	 in	 the	 cylinder	 moving	 steadily	 up	 and	 down,	 and	 the eccentric,	which	always	appeared	to	me	as	a	sort	of	bandy-legged	giant, </p>
<p class="calibre1">executing	its	extraordinary	double-shuffle	in	a	more	graceful	fashion	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	 we	 were	 going	 at	 full	 speed,	 as	 it	 performed	 its	 allotted	 task	 of curvetting	the	up-and-down	motion	of	the	piston	into	a	circular	one,	thus</p>
<p class="calibre1">making	 the	 shaft	 revolve;	 while	 Grummet,	 the	 third	 engineer,	 who	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	 watching	 the	 throttle	 valve,	 hand	 on	 lever,	 had	 a	 far	 easier	 job	 than previously,	 when	 we	 were	 running	 with	 full	 power	 before	 wind	 and	 sea, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	rolling	and	pitching	at	every	angle	every	minute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 even	 in	 the	 fleeting	 glance	 I	 had	 passing	 by,	 the	 screw	 still	 went round	 in	 a	 dangerous	 way	 when	 the	 stern	 of	 the	 vessel	 lifted,	 as	 some big	wave	passed	under	her	keel,	in	spite	of	all	Grummet’s	precautions	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">turning	 off	 steam	 and	 I	 could	 not	 help	 wondering	 how	 long	 the	 engines would	 stand	 the	 strain,	 which	 was	 all	 the	 more	 perilous	 from	 being</p>
<p class="calibre1">intermittent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	reaching	my	destination	below,	however,	all	thought	of	the	machinery</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 any	 possible	 damage	 to	 the	 ship	 was	 instantly	 banished	 from	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind	by	the	sight	that	met	my	gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	narrow	stoke-hold,	lit	up	by	the	ruddy	glare	of	the	furnace	fires,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">light	 from	 which	 enabled	 me	 to	 see	 the	 brackish	 bilge	 water	 washing</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	beneath	the	hole	in	the	flooring	and	gurgling	up	through	the	broken</p>
<p class="calibre1">portplates	 there,	 I	 saw	 that	 a	 group	 of	 half-naked	 firemen,	 and	 others, were	 bending	 over	 a	 pile	 of	 empty	 coal	 sacks	 heaped	 up	 against	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">further	 bulkhead,	 dividing	 the	 occupied	 apartments	 from	 the	 main	 hold, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 far	 away	 as	 possible	 from	 the	 blazing	 fires,	 on	 which	 one	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>stokers	on	duty	pitched	occasionally	a	shovelful	of	fuel,	or	smoothed	the surface	of	the	glowing	embers	with	a	long-toothed	rake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 couldn’t	 distinguish	 at	 first	 any	 one	 in	 particular,	 the	 backs	 of	 all	 being towards	 me	 as	 I	 came	 down	 the	 slippery	 steel	 ladder,	 carrying	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hammock,	for	I	had	taken	the	precaution	of	hoisting	it	on	my	shoulders	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaving	the	engine-flat	above,	in	order	to	prevent	its	getting	wet,	while	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">noise	 of	 the	 machinery	 overhead	 and	 the	 roar	 of	 the	 furnaces,	 coupled</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	washing	of	the	water,	prevented	my	hearing	any	distant	sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Presently	 however,	 I	 recognised	 Garry	 O’Neil’s	 voice	 above	 the	 general</p>
<p class="calibre1">din. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Clear	 off,	 ye	 murthorin’	 divvles!”	 he	 cried,	 waving	 his	 arms	 above	 the heads	 of	 the	 crowd	 of	 onlookers,	 as	 I	 could	 now	 see.	 “The	 poor	 chap</p>
<p class="calibre1">wants	air,	and	ye’re	stayling	the	viry	br’ith	out	of	his	nosshrils!	Away	wid</p>
<p class="calibre1">ye	 all,	 ye	 spalpeens!	 or	 by	 the	 powers,	 it’s	 a-pizening	 the	 howl	 batch	 of ye	I’ll	be	doin’	the	next	toime	ye	comes	to	me	for	pill	or	powdher!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	men	clustering	round	him	spread	out,	moving	nearer	to	me;	and	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">laughed	 at	 his	 comical	 threat—which	 sounded	 all	 the	 more	 humorous</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 the	 Irishman’s	 racy	 brogue,	 which	 became	 all	 the	 more	 prominent</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	 Garry	 was	 at	 all	 excited.	 God	 knows,	 though,	 their	 merriment, </p>
<p class="calibre1">untimely	 as	 it	 might	 have	 sounded	 to	 outside	 ears,	 betrayed	 no	 want	 of sympathy	 with	 their	 comrade.	 They	 laughed,	 as	 sailors	 will	 do</p>
<p class="calibre1">sometimes,	 holding	 their	 lives	 in	 their	 hands,	 as	 is	 the	 practice	 of	 those who	have	to	brave	the	manifold	dangers	of	the	deep	below	and	aloft	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">shipboard,	even	when	standing	on	the	brink	of	eternity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	they	moved	away,	the	fierce	light	from	one	of	the	open	furnace	doors</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	beating	on	their	bare	bodies	and	making	them	look,	indeed,	the	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">devils	to	whom	the	Irishman	had	jocularly	likened	them;	the	latter	looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	quickly,	saw	me,	and	beckoned	me	to	approach	nearer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Arrah,	come	along,	man,	with	those	bandages!”	he	said.	“Sure	ye	moight</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 made	 ’em	 in	 the	 toime	 since	 I	 called	 up	 to	 the	 skipper.	 Where	 are they	now,	me	darlint?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	produced	the	roll	of	lint	at	once	from	the	pocket	of	my	monkey	jacket. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>“Hullo!”	 said	 he	 as	 he	 took	 and	 deftly	 proceeded	 to	 unroll	 the	 bundle	 of bandages,	“what’s	that	you’ve	got	on	your	shoulders—a	rick?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	hammock,	sir,”	I	replied.	“Cap’en	Applegarth	told	me	to	bring	one	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	lifting	the	poor	chap	who’s	so	hurt,	and	so	I	took	my	own,	which	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">blankets	already	in	it,	thinking	it	would	be	warmer	for	him,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Begorrah,	 the	 skipper’s	 got	 his	 head	 screwed	 on	 straight,	 and	 you	 the same,	 too,	 Haldane,”	 said	 he	 approvingly,	 with	 a	 sagacious	 nod	 as	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">bent	over	the	pile	of	sacks	in	the	corner.	“Come	and	see	the	poor	fellow, </p>
<p class="calibre1">me	bhoy.	There	doesn’t	seem	much	loife	lift	in	him,	sure,	hay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	certainly	did	not;	to	me	he	looked	already	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stretched	 out	 on	 the	 pile	 of	 dirty	 sacking,	 in	 a	 half-sitting,	 half-reclining position,	 lay	 the	 recumbent	 figure,	 or	 rather	 form,	 of	 the	 unfortunate</p>
<p class="calibre1">fireman	 Jackson,	 his	 face	 as	 ghastly	 as	 that	 of	 a	 corpse,	 while	 his	 rigid limbs	and	the	absence	of	all	appearance	of	respiration	tended	to	confirm</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	belief	that	the	spark	of	life	had	fled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stoddart,	 the	 second	 engineer,	 was	 kneeling	 beside	 the	 poor	 fellow, </p>
<p class="calibre1">rubbing	 his	 hands	 and	 holding	 every	 now	 and	 then	 to	 his	 nose	 what</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	to	me	a	bottle	of	ammonia	or	some	very	pungent	restorative,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">powerful	 fumes	 of	 which	 overcame	 the	 foetid	 atmosphere	 of	 the	 stoke-</p>
<p class="calibre1">hold,	 Mr	 Stokes,	 looking	 almost	 as	 pale	 as	 the	 unconscious	 man, </p>
<p class="calibre1">assisting	 with	 his	 unwounded	 arm,	 with	 which	 he	 lifted	 Jackson’s	 head, </p>
<p class="calibre1">his	broken	one	being	already	set	in	splints	by	our	doctor-mate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blanchard,	 the	 other	 sufferer	 from	 the	 accident,	 was	 sitting	 down	 on	 a bench	near	by,	evidently	recovering	from	the	shock	he	had	experienced, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which	really	was	not	so	serious	as	at	first	anticipated,	a	rather	stiff	glass</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 brandy	 and	 water	 which	 Garry	 had	 given	 him,	 having	 pretty	 soon</p>
<p class="calibre1">brought	him	to	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	our	attention,	therefore,	concentrated	on	Jackson,	who,	as	yet,	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	sign	of	amendment,	in	spite	of	every	remedy	tried	by	O’Neil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	 George!”	 exclaimed	 Mr	 Stokes,	 a	 few	 minutes	 later	 when	 we	 all</p>
<p class="calibre1">began	to	despair	of	ever	bringing	him	back	to	life	again.	“I’m	sure	I	felt	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">head	move	then!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>“Aye,	 sir,”	 corroborated	 Stoddart,	 pressing	 his	 hand	 gently	 on	 Jackson’s chest,	 to	 feel	 his	 heart,	 where	 a	 slight	 convulsive	 movement	 became</p>
<p class="calibre1">perceptible,	 at	 first	 feeble	 and	 uncertain	 enough,	 as	 you	 may	 suppose, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 then	 more	 and	 more	 sustained	 and	 regular,	 as	 if	 the	 lungs	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">getting	to	work	again.	“Look	alive!	he’s	beginning	to	breathe	again—and</p>
<p class="calibre1">—yes—his	heart	beats,	I	declare,	quite	plain!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hurray!”	 shouted	 Garry	 O’Neil,	 hastily	 putting	 to	 his	 patient’s	 lips	 a medicine	 glass,	 into	 which	 he	 dropped	 something	 out	 of	 a	 small	 vial, </p>
<p class="calibre1">filling	 up	 the	 glass	 with	 water.	 “I’ve	 got	 something	 here	 shtrang	 enough, begorrah,	to	make	a	dead	man	spake!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	effect	of	the	drug,	whatever	it	was,	seemed	magical.	In	an	instant	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">previously	 motionless	 figure	 moved	 about	 uneasily,	 the	 pulsation	 of	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">chest	 grew	 more	 rapid	 and	 pronounced,	 and	 then,	 stretching	 out	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">clenched	 hands	 with	 a	 jerk,	 as	 if	 he	 were	 suddenly	 galvanised	 into	 life, thereby	 displaying	 the	 magnificent	 proportions	 of	 his	 torso,	 he	 being</p>
<p class="calibre1">stripped	 to	 the	 waist,	 Jackson	 opened	 his	 eyes,	 drawing	 a	 deep	 breath</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	while,	a	breath	something	between	a	sob	and	a	sigh! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where—where	 am	 I?”	 he	 said,	 looking	 round	 with	 a	 sort	 of	 far-away, </p>
<p class="calibre1">dreamy	 stare,	 but	 meeting	 Mr	 Stokes’	 sympathetic	 gaze,	 he	 at	 once</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	to	recover	his	consciousness.	“Ah,	I	know,	sir.	I	found	out	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	the	matter	with	the	suction	before	that	plate	buckled	and	gripped	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 have	 cleared	 the	 rose	 box,	 too,	 sir,	 and	 you	 can	 connect	 the	 bilgepumps	again	as	soon	as	you	like,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	course	all	this	took	him	some	time	to	get	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	my	man,”	answered	the	old	chief,	greatly	overcome	at	the	fact</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 old	 sailor,	 wounded	 to	 the	 death,	 thinking	 of	 his	 duty	 in	 the	 first moment	of	his	recovery.	“Never	mind	that,	man!	How	do	you	feel	now,	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">poor	fellow—better,	I	trust?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why,	 just	 a	 little	 pain	 here,	 sir,”	 said	 Jackson,	 pressing	 his	 hand	 to	 his right	side.	“I’m	thankful,	though,	my	legs	escaped,	sir.	I’ve	no	pain	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Garry	O’Neil	looked	grave	and	shook	his	head	at	this,	and	looking	too	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	cast	down	his	eyes	over	the	lower	part	of	the	unfortunate	man’s	body, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 saw	 that	 the	 cruel	 edges	 of	 the	 iron	 plates	 had	 torn	 away	 part	 of	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>canvas	overalls	from	the	thigh	to	the	knee	of	one	leg,	peeling	off	with	the covering,	the	flesh	from	the	bone;	while	the	foot	of	the	other—boot	and	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">—was	crushed	into	a	shapeless	bloody	mass	horrible	to	behold,	the	sight</p>
<p class="calibre1">making	one	feel	sick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 a	 bad	 sign	 his	 having	 no	 fayling	 there,	 Haldane,”	 whispered	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irishman	to	me	very	low,	so	that	Jackson	could	not	hear.	“It’s	jost	what	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought,	sure.	God	may	help	him,	but	I	can’t.	He’ll	niver	recover,	do	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	moight	for	him,	niver	in	this	worruld.	The	poor	misfortunate	fellow	has</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 spoine	 injured,	 and	 he	 can’t	 live	 forty-eight	 hours,	 if	 as	 long	 as	 that, sure!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 did	 not	 tell	 him	 this,	 however;	 nor	 did	 he	 lead	 any	 of	 the	 others	 to understand,	either,	that	Jackson’s	case	was	hopeless! </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	contrary,	when	he	spoke	aloud,	as	he	did	immediately	afterwards, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	seemed	in	the	best	of	spirits,	as	if	everything	was	going	on	as	well	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible,	though	I	noticed	a	tear	in	his	eye	and	a	quiver	in	his	voice	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">touched	me	to	the	heart,	making	me	turn	away	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	 you	 mustn’t	 talk	 now,	 old	 fellow,	 for	 we	 want	 you	 to	 husband	 all your	strength	to	get	up	the	hatchway	to	a	foine	cabin	of	yer	own	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">upper	deck,	where	we’re	goin’	to	nurse	ye,	me	darlint,	till	ye’re	all	roight, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sure!”	 he	 said	 cheerfully.	 “Here,	 now,	 just	 dhrink	 another	 drop	 of	 the craythur,	 me	 bhoy,	 to	 kape	 yer	 spirits	 up,	 and	 you,	 Master	 Haldane,	 jist hand	 over	 that	 hammock	 ye’ve	 got	 storved	 away	 on	 ye	 shulder,	 so	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	can	fix	up	Jackson	comfortable	like	for	his	trip	to	the	upper	reggins!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	 saying,	 the	 good-hearted	 Irishman	 busied	 himself,	 with	 the	 help	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Stoddart,	who	was	equally	gentle	in	handling	the	poor	fellow,	getting	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">ready	 for	 removal;	 and	 when	 he	 had	 been	 carefully	 placed	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hammock	 and	 covered	 with	 the	 blanket,	 the	 two	 of	 them,	 both	 being</p>
<p class="calibre1">strong	 and	 powerful	 men,	 they	 lifted	 their	 burden	 with	 the	 utmost</p>
<p class="calibre1">tenderness	and	carried	him	upward	to	the	main	deck,	where	he	was	put</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	a	berth	in	one	of	the	state	rooms	that	the	steward	had	prepared,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">every	attention	paid	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr	 Fosset	 and	 I	 helped	 up	 Blanchard,	 the	 other	 fireman,	 he,	 luckily,	 not requiring	to	be	carried;	and	we	then	went	down	for	Mr	Stokes,	who	had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a>refused	to	leave	the	stoke-hold	until	his	men	had	been	attended	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Propping	 up	 the	 stout	 old	 chap	 behind	 so	 that	 he	 could	 not	 slip	 back down	the	slippery	steel	ladder,	as	he	only	had	the	one	arm	now	to	hold</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	by,	the	three	of	us	reached	the	level	of	the	engine-room	all	right,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">chief,	 resting	 here	 a	 moment	 to	 give	 a	 look	 round	 and	 a	 word	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Grummet,	who	of	course	was	still	in	charge,	telling	him	to	slow	down	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">further	 and	 use	 all	 his	 spare	 steam	 for	 clearing	 the	 bilge,	 as	 the	 sluice valves	 had	 been	 opened	 to	 prevent	 the	 fires	 being	 flooded	 out,	 and	 the pumps	were	in	good	working	order	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grummet	 promised	 to	 attend	 carefully	 to	 these	 directions,	 and	 a	 host	 of others	I	cannot	now	recollect,	poor	Mr	Stokes	being	as	fussy	and	fidgetty</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 he	 was	 fat,	 and	 in	 the	 habit	 of	 unintentionally	 worrying	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">subordinates	a	good	deal	in	this	way,	and	the	three	of	us	again	started	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	 way	 upwards,	 the	 old	 chief	 leading,	 as	 before,	 and	 Mr	 Fosset	 and	 I bringing	 up	 the	 rear	 very	 slowly,	 so	 as	 to	 prevent	 accident,	 when	 all	 at once	there	was	a	fearful	crash	that	echoed	through	my	brain,	followed	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	violent	concussion	of	the	air	which	nearly	threw	us	all	down	the	engine-</p>
<p class="calibre1">room	ladder,	though	Mr	Fosset	and	I	were	both	hanging	on	to	it	like	grim</p>
<p class="calibre1">death	and	supporting	the	whole	weight	of	Mr	Stokes	between	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	same	instant,	too,	the	crank	shaft	stopped	revolving,	all	motion	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 machinery	 ceased,	 and	 the	 hatchway,	 with	 all	 the	 space	 around	 us, </p>
<p class="calibre1">was	filled	by	a	dense	cloud	of	hot	steam! </p>

<p class="calibre1">Nor	was	this	the	worst,	for	hardly	had	we	begun	to	draw	breath	again	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 stifling	 vapour-bath-like	 atmosphere	 surrounding	 us,	 ere	 we	 could</p>
<p class="calibre1">utter	a	cry,	indeed,	or	exchange	a	word	of	speech	with	reference	to	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 just	 occurred,	 there	 arose	 a	 sudden	 and	 violent	 oscillation	 of	 the vessel,	which	pitched	and	rolled,	and	then	heeled	over	suddenly	to	port, </p>
<p class="calibre1">while	an	avalanche	of	water	came	thundering	down	the	hatchway	on	top</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	our	heads. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>“Good	 Lord,	 we’re	 lost!”	 gulped	 out	 Mr	 Stokes	 as	 we	 all	 floundered together	 on	 the	 grating	 forming	 the	 floor	 of	 the	 engine-room,	 where</p>
<p class="calibre1">fortunately	 the	 flood	 had	 washed	 us,	 instead	 of	 hustling	 us	 down	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">stoke-hold	below,	where	all	three	of	us	would	most	inevitably	have	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">killed	by	the	fall.	“A	boiler’s	burst	and	the	ship	broached-to!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	 quite	 so	 bad	 as	 that,	 sir,”	 sang	 out	 the	 voice	 of	 Grummet	 in	 the distance,	 the	 thick	 vapour	 lending	 it	 a	 far-away	 sound.	 “The	 vessel	 is recovering	 herself	 again,	 and	 the	 cylinder	 cover’s	 blown	 off,	 sir—that’s all!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">All</i>,	indeed!”	exclaimed	the	old	chief	in	a	despairing	tone	as	he	staggered to	his	feet,	enabling	Mr	Fosset	and	myself	to	rise	up	too—an	impossibility</p>
<p class="calibre1">before,	as	he	was	right	on	top	of	us,	and	had	served	us	out	worse	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	water	had	done.	“Quite	enough	damage	for	me,	and	all	of	us,	I	think!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How’s	 your	 arm,	 Mr	 Stokes?”	 asked	 Mr	 Fosset	 as	 the	 atmosphere</p>
<p class="calibre1">cleared	 a	 little	 and	 the	 engine-room	 lights	 glimmered	 through	 the	 misty darkness	 that	 now	 enveloped	 the	 place.	 “I	 hope	 it	 hasn’t	 been	 hurt	 by your	tumble?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 damn	 my	 arm!”	 cried	 the	 other	 impatiently,	 evidently	 more	 anxious</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	the	machinery	than	his	arm.	“Have	you	shut	off	the	steam?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,”	replied	his	subordinate	calmly.	“I	closed	all	the	stop	valves	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">here	the	moment	I	knew	what	had	happened;	and	the	men	below	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">stoke-hold	have	cut	off	the	supply	from	the	main	pipe,	while	Mr	Links	has</p>
<p class="calibre1">gone	into	the	screw	well	to	disconnect	the	propeller.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very	good,	Grummet.	So	they	be	all	right	down	below?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	God	for	that!	How	about	the	fires?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Drowned	 out,	 sir,	 all	 but	 the	 one	 under	 the	 fire	 boiler	 on	 the	 starboard side.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’d	better	look	after	that,	to	keep	the	bilge-pumps	going,	or	else	it’ll	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	 drowned	 out,	 with	 this	 lot	 of	 water	 coming	 down	 the	 hatchway	 every</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>time	the	ship	rolls!	I	do	hope	the	skipper	will	lie-to	and	keep	her	head	to sea	until	we	can	get	the	engines	going	again,	though	I’m	afraid	that’ll	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	long	job!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	Grummet	could	reply	to	this,	Stoddart,	the	second	officer,	or	rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">engineer,	 came	 scrambling	 down	 from	 the	 saloon,	 where	 he	 had	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">assisting	Garry	O’Neil	in	making	poor	Jackson	comfortable,	the	escape	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	steam	having	evidently	told	its	own	tale	to	an	expert	like	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although	 a	 younger	 man	 than	 Mr	 Stokes,	 his	 brains	 were	 considerably</p>
<p class="calibre1">sharper	and	he	was	a	better	mechanic	in	every	way;	so	now,	when,	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">examining	 the	 damage	 done	 to	 the	 cylinder,	 he	 made	 light	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">accident,	instead	of	groaning	over	it	like	the	old	chief.	Mr	Fosset,	I	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">see,	and	with	him	myself	also,	who	shared	his	belief,	saw	that	the	injury</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	not	irreparable	and	that	it	might	certainly	have	been	worse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	it	can’t	be	done	in	a	day!”	Stoddart	said;	“still	it	can	be	patched</p>
<p class="calibre1">up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 all	 very	 well,”	 interposed	 Mr	 Stokes,	 holding	 to	 his	 despondent view	 of	 the	 situation.	 “But	 I’d	 like	 to	 know	 how	 you’re	 going	 to	 get	 that cracked	cover	off	the	cylinder	with	the	vessel	rolling	like	this!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 I’ll	 manage	 that	 easy	 enough,”	 said	 the	 energetic	 fellow	 in	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">confident	 way.	 “I’ve	 done	 worse	 jobs	 than	 that	 in	 a	 heavy	 sea.	 Why,	 I’ll lash	myself	to	the	cylinder	if	it	comes	to	the	worse	and	unscrew	the	cover</p>
<p class="calibre1">nut	by	nut,	shifting	my	berth	round	till	I	have	it	off.	Then	if	Grummet	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	to	getting	the	portable	forge	ready,	and	some	old	sheet	iron	or	boiler</p>
<p class="calibre1">plates	for	working	and	making	into	a	patch,	and	if	Links	will	turn	out	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">new	 bolts	 and	 screws	 with	 the	 lathe,	 we’ll	 have	 everything	 in	 working</p>
<p class="calibre1">order	before	we	know	where	we	are!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bravo,	 my	 hearty!”	 cried	 Mr	 Fosset,	 lending	 Stoddart	 a	 hand	 to	 lash</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself	 to	 the	 cylinder,	 while	 Grummet	 held	 a	 screw-wrench	 and	 other</p>
<p class="calibre1">tools	up	to	him.	“You	ought	to	be	a	sailor,	you’re	so	smart!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	prefer	my	own	billet,”	retorted	the	other	with	an	air	of	conscious	power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	an	engineer!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr	Fosset	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>“All	right!”	said	he	good-humouredly.	“Every	one	to	his	trade!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Humph!”	 groaned	 Mr	 Stokes,	 who	 was	 leaning	 against	 the	 bulkhead, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“looking	 very	 white	 about	 the	 gills,”	 as	 Grummet	 whispered	 to	 me.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">steam	gradually	dispersing	and	the	lights	burning	more	brightly,	enabled</p>
<p class="calibre1">us	to	see	his	face	better.	“I	suppose	there’s	nothing	I	can	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 nothing,	 sir,”	 answered	 Stoddart,	 busy	 at	 the	 moment	 with	 the	 first nut	of	the	cylinder	cover.	“You	can	very	safely	leave	matters	to	Grummet</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	me!	And	Mr	O’Neil	told	me	as	I	left	the	maindeck	that	you	ought	to	go</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	your	cabin	and	lie	down,	so	as	to	rest	your	arm,	or	it	might	mortify,	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">says,	when	he	would	not	answer	for	the	consequences,	you	understand, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	that	settles	the	matter;	I	won’t	give	our	amateur	sawbones	a	chance</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	lopping	it	off,	as	I	daresay	he’d	like!”	said	poor	Mr	Stokes,	with	a	feeble</p>
<p class="calibre1">attempt	at	a	joke.	“Yes,	I’d	better	go	to	my	cabin,	for	I	see	I’m	not	wanted</p>
<p class="calibre1">here;	and,	to	tell	the	truth,	I’ve	an	aching	all	over	me,	and	feel	rather	tired</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	faint.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	off	you	go	to	the	doctor	at	once,”	cried	Mr	Fosset,	catching	hold	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	 by	 his	 uninjured	 arm	 and	 leading	 him	 towards	 the	 hatchway	 again, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	ship	being	pretty	steady	for	the	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	and	I,	too,	Haldane,	ought	to	be	on	deck	helping	the	skipper	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rest,	instead	of	stopping	here,	hindering	these	smart	fellows	at	their	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Come	along	with	me,	my	lad!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leaving	 Mr	 Stokes	 at	 the	 door	 of	 the	 saloon	 in	 charge	 of	 Weston,	 the steward,	 the	 first	 mate	 and	 I	 proceeded	 along	 the	 waist	 to	 the	 bridge, where	 we	 found	 Captain	 Applegarth	 pacing	 up	 and	 down	 in	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">customary	 jerky,	 impatient	 way,	 like	 the	 Polar	 bear	 in	 the	 Zoological</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gardens,	as	I	always	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,”	he	said	to	Mr	Fosset,	bringing	himself	up	short	in	front	of	the	rail</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	our	approach,	“how	are	matters	getting	on	below—badly,	I’m	afraid?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 first	 mate	 explained.	 Spokeshave,	 who	 was	 at	 the	 other	 end	 of	 the bridge,	coming	up	to	listen,	as	usual,	to	the	conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>“That’s	 good	 news,	 indeed!”	 said	 the	 skipper	 on	 hearing	 how	 Stoddart had	 set	 to	 work	 to	 repair	 the	 damage.	 “I	 thought	 the	 engines	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">completely	 broken-down.	 If	 it	 weren’t	 for	 poor	 Jackson,	 who,	 O’Neil	 told me	just	now,	was	in	a	bad	way,	I	think	we’d	got	out	of	the	scrape	pretty</p>
<p class="calibre1">well,	for	the	old	barquey	is	comfortable	enough	now,	and,	though	there’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	heavy	sea	running	and	it	is	still	blowing	stiff	from	the	north’ard	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">west’ard,	the	sky	is	clearer	than	it	was,	and	I	fancy	we’ve	seen	the	worst</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	gale,	eh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sure	I	hope	so,	sir,”	replied	Mr	Fosset,	not	committing	himself	to	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">definite	expression	of	opinion	in	the	matter.	“It	has	given	us	a	rare	good</p>
<p class="calibre1">doing	all	round	while	it	was	about	it,	at	an	rate!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	 it	 has	 that,”	 said	 the	 skipper.	 “The	 old	 barquey,	 though,	 has	 come through	 it	 better	 than	 any	 one	 would	 have	 supposed,	 with	 all	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">deadweight	amidships,	considering	that	she	broached-to	awhile	ago	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">got	caught	in	the	trough	of	the	sea	the	very	moment	the	machinery	below</p>
<p class="calibre1">gave	 out.	 By	 George,	 Fosset,	 we	 had	 a	 narrow	 squeak	 then,	 I	 can	 tell you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	quite	believe	that,	sir,”	said	the	other,	looking	round	about	and	aloft, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sailor-like,	 as	 he	 spoke.	 “For	 my	 part	 I	 feared	 the	 worst,	 I’m	 sure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,	all’s	well	that	ends	well,	and	the	old	barquey	looks	first	rate,	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	say,	sir,	in	spite	of	all	she’s	gone	through.	She	rides	like	a	cork.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 certainly	 was	 a	 capital	 seaboat	 and	 lay-to	 now	 as	 easily	 as	 if	 she were	at	anchor	in	the	Mersey,	though	the	wind	was	whistling	through	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rigging	and	the	ocean	far	and	wide	white	with	foam,	bowing	and	scraping</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	big	waves	that	rolled	in	after	her	like	an	old	dowager	duchess	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">ball	room,	curtseying	to	her	partner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During	 the	 long	 time	 the	 first	 mate	 and	 I	 had	 been	 down	 below	 in	 the stoke-hold,	the	skipper	had	lowered	the	upper	yards	and	housed	her	topmasts,	 getting	 her	 also	 under	 snugger	 canvas,	 the	 fore	 and	 mizzen</p>
<p class="calibre1">topsails	being	set	“scandalised,”	as	we	call	it	aboard	ship,	that	is,	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">heads	of	the	sails	hauled	up,	and	their	sheets	flattened	taut	as	boards,	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	to	expose	as	little	surface	as	possible	to	the	wind,	only	just	sufficient</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	keep	the	vessel	with	her	head	to	sea,	like	a	stag	at	bay. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>Opportunity	had	also	been	taken,	I	noticed,	to	secure	the	broken	engine-room	 skylight	 in	 a	 more	 substantial	 way	 than	 formerly,	 and	 so	 prevent</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	 more	 green	 seas	 from	 flooding	 the	 hold,	 the	 opening	 having	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">planked	 over	 by	 the	 carpenter,	 and	 heavy	 bars	 of	 railroad	 iron,	 which</p>
<p class="calibre1">formed	 part	 of	 our	 cargo,	 laid	 across,	 instead	 of	 the	 tarpaulin	 that	 was deemed	good	enough	before	and	had	given	way	when	Mr	Stokes—poor</p>
<p class="calibre1">man—and	the	first	mate	and	myself	got	washed	down	the	hatchway	by	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">wave	that	came	over	the	side,	crumpling	the	flimsy	covering	as	if	it	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">tissue	paper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Altogether,	 the	 outlook	 was	 more	 reassuring	 than	 when	 I	 had	 gone</p>
<p class="calibre1">below;	 for	 although	 a	 fierce	 northerly	 gale	 was	 howling	 over	 the	 deep, making	it	heave	and	fret	and	lashing	it	up	into	wild	mountainous	billows, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	heaven	overhead	was	clear	of	all	cloud,	and	the	complaisant	moon, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which	 was	 at	 the	 full,	 but	 shining	 with	 a	 pale,	 peaceful	 light,	 while numerous	stars	were	twinkling	everywhere	in	the	endless	expanse	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">firmament	above,	gazing	down	serenely	at	the	riot	of	the	elements	below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	now	close	on	midnight	and	Garry	O’Neil	came	on	deck	to	take	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">middle	watch,	it	being	his	turn	of	duty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 doctor,”	 said	 the	 skipper,	 anxious	 to	 hear	 something	 about	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">invalids,	“how’re	your	patients?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Both	going	on	capitally;	Jackson	sleeping	quietly,	sir,	though	he	can’t	last</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	long,	poor	fellow!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	Mr	Stokes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith,	 he’s	 drivin’	 his	 pigs	 to	 market	 in	 foine	 stoil;	 you	 should	 only	 hear him,	cap’en!”	answered	the	Irishman,	looking	out	to	windward.	“Begorrah, </p>
<p class="calibre1">ain’t	 it	 blowin’,	 though,	 sir!	 Sure,	 as	 we	 used	 to	 say	 at	 ould	 Trinity,  <i class="calibre4">de</i> <i class="calibre4">gustibus	 non	 est	 disputandum</i>,	 which	 means,	 Mister	 Spokeshave,	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">yo’re	cockin’	up	your	nose	to	hear	what	I’m	after	sayin’,	it’s	moighty	gusty, </p>
<p class="calibre1">an’	there’s	no	denyin’	it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 skipper	 laughed,	 as	 he	 generally	 did	 at	 Garry’s	 nonsensical,	 queer</p>
<p class="calibre1">sayings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	George,	O’Neil!	I	must	go	down	and	have	a	glass	of	grog	to	wash	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>taste	 of	 that	 awful	 pun	 out	 of	 my	 mouth!”	 he	 cried,	 turning	 to	 leave	 the bridge	for	the	first	time	since	he	had	come	up	there	at	sunset.	“You	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">call	me	if	anything	happens	or	should	it	come	to	blow	worse,	but	I	shall</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	up	and	down	all	night	to	see	how	you’re	getting	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Och!	 the	 divvle	 dout	 ye!”	 muttered	 the	 Irishman	 in	 his	 quizzing	 way,	 as the	 skipper	 went	 down	 the	 ladder,	 giving	 a	 word	 to	 the	 boatswain	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	at	the	wheel	below	as	he	passed	them	on	his	way	up.	“Ye	niver	give</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	chap	the	cridit	of	keeping	a	watch	to	himself!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon	after	this	I,	too,	left	the	deck	and	turned	in,	Garry	O’Neil	telling	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	did	not	want	me	on	the	bridge	and	that	I	had	better	sleep	while	I	could, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 permission	 I	 readily	 availed	 myself	 of,	 tired	 out	 with	 all	 I	 had	 gone through	and	the	various	exciting	episodes	of	the	evening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 no	 change	 in	 the	 weather	 the	 following	 morning,	 the	 wind</p>
<p class="calibre1">even	blowing	with	greater	force	and	the	sea	such	as	I	had	never	seen	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">before,	and	such	a	sea	as	I	hope	never	to	experience	again;	so,	in	order</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 the	 ship	 might	 ride	 the	 more	 easily	 and	 those	 below	 in	 the	 engine-room	better	able	to	go	on	with	the	repair	of	the	cylinder	than	they	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 the	 old	 barquey	 pitching	 her	 bows	 under	 and	 then	 kicking	 up	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">heels	sky	high,	varying	her	performances	by	rolling	side	to	side	violently, </p>
<p class="calibre1">like	 a	 pendulum	 gone	 mad,	 the	 skipper	 had	 all	 our	 spare	 spars	 lashed</p>
<p class="calibre1">together,	 and	 attaching	 a	 stout	 steel	 wire	 hawser	 to	 them,	 launched	 the lot	overboard	through	a	hole	in	the	bulwarks,	where	one	of	the	waves	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">made	 a	 convenient	 clean	 sweep,	 veering	 the	 hawser	 ahead	 with	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1">“jetsam”	to	serve	as	a	floating	anchor	for	us,	and	moor	the	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	this	means	we	all	had	a	more	comfortable	time	of	it,	the	old	barquey</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	 longer	 shipping	 water	 in	 any	 considerable	 quantity	 and	 there	 being</p>
<p class="calibre1">less	 work	 below	 in	 the	 way	 of	 clearing	 it,	 all	 of	 the	 bilge-pumps, </p>
<p class="calibre1">fortunately	 for	 us	 all,	 Stoddart	 and	 the	 engine-room	 staff	 were	 able	 to keep	going;	otherwise	we	must	have	foundered	long	since! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 gale	 continued	 without	 abatement	 all	 that	 day	 and	 the	 next,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">second	since	our	mishap,	when,	late	in	the	afternoon	the	wind	began	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">go	down,	veering	from	the	north-west	to	the	north,	and	so	on,	back	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">eastern	quadrant. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>Soon	 after	 this,	 just	 before	 it	 got	 dark,	 an	 English	 man-of-war	 hove	 in sight,	 and,	 seeing	 our	 disabled	 condition,	 signalled	 to	 ask	 whether	 we</p>
<p class="calibre1">required	any	assistance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through	the	clumsiness	of	Mr	Spokeshave,	who	had	charge	of	our	signal</p>
<p class="calibre1">department	 and	 showed	 his	 cleverness	 by	 hoisting	 the	 very	 numbers	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 flags	 giving	 the	 skipper’s	 reply,	 that,	 though	 our	 engines	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">temporarily	 broken-down,	 they	 were	 fast	 being	 repaired,	 the	 captain	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 man-of-war	 could	 not	 understand	 him;	 and	 so,	 fearing	 the	 worst, </p>
<p class="calibre1">ranged	up	under	our	stern	to	see	what	help	he	could	render	in	what	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">evidently	 considered,	 from	 Spokeshave’s	 “hoist,”	 to	 be	 a	 pressing</p>
<p class="calibre1">emergency. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ship	 ahoy!”	 he	 shouted	 through	 a	 speaking	 trumpet	 from	 his	 quarter-</p>
<p class="calibre1">deck	 aft,	 which	 was	 on	 a	 level	 with	 our	 bridge,	 the	 vessel,	 a	 splendid cruiser	 of	 the	 first-class,	 towering	 over	 the	 comparatively	 puny</p>
<p class="calibre1">dimensions	 of	 the	 poor,	 broken-down	  <i class="calibre4">Star	 of	 the	 North</i>.	 “Shall	 I	 send	 a boat	aboard	with	assistance?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 thank	 you	 very	 much,”	 replied	 our	 skipper,	 taking	 off	 his	 cap	 and returning	the	greeting	of	the	naval	officer.	“We’ve	got	over	the	worst	of	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">now,	sir,	and	will	be	soon	under	weigh	again,	as	the	weather	is	breaking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Glad	to	hear	it,”	returned	the	other,	who	could	read	our	name	astern	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	lay	athwart	us.	“Where	are	you	bound	to?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“New	 York,	 sir,”	 sang	 out	 the	 skipper.	 “Twelve	 days	 out	 from	 England. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’ve	been	disabled	forty-eight	hours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hope	 your	 engines	 will	 soon	 be	 in	 working	 order,”	 sang	 out	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">handsome	 officer	 from	 the	 deck	 of	 the	 man-of-war,	 giving	 some	 other</p>
<p class="calibre1">order	 at	 the	 same	 minute,	 for	 I	 heard	 the	 shrill	 sound	 of	 a	 boatswain’s pipe	 and	 the	 rattle	 of	 feet	 along	 her	 deck.	 “Please	 report	 us	 when	 you reach	your	destination.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	name,	sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Her	Majesty’s	ship	 <i class="calibre4">Aurora</i>,	on	passage	from	Bermuda	to	Halifax.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 that	 he	 waved	 his	 hand,	 and	 her	 white	 ensign,	 whose	 blood-red</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a>cross	of	Saint	George	stood	out	in	bold	relief,	dipped	in	parting	salute	to our	 vessel,	 which	 reciprocated	 the	 compliment	 as	 the	 man-of-war	 bore</p>
<p class="calibre1">away	on	her	course	to	the	northward,	a	group	of	officers	rollicking	round</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 captain	 on	 her	 deck	 aft	 and	 gazing	 at	 us	 as	 she	 moved	 off	 rapidly under	a	full	pressure	of	steam,	evidently	admiring	our	skipper’s	wonderful</p>
<p class="calibre1">sea	anchor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	noble	ship	glided	away	through	the	still	tempestuous	sea	against	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">strong	 headwind,	 a	 thing	 of	 beauty	 and	 of	 might—such	 a	 contrast	 to	 us lying	there,	almost	at	the	mercy	of	the	seas—I	could	not	help	thinking	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 wondrous	 power	 of	 mind	 over	 matter	 displayed	 in	 our	 grand	 ocean</p>
<p class="calibre1">steamers,	and	what	a	responsibility	rests	upon	their	engineers! </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	 little	 do	 the	 thousands	 of	 passengers	 who	 yearly	 go	 to	 and	 fro</p>
<p class="calibre1">across	the	Atlantic	know,	or,	indeed,	care	to	know,	that	their	comfort	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	rate	at	which	they	travel	through	the	water—they	who	talk	so	glibly	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">making	 the	 passage	 in	 such	 and	 such	 a	 time,	 be	 the	 sea	 smooth	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1">rough,	 and	 the	 wind	 fine	 or	 contrary—that	 all	 this	 depends	 on	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">unceasing	 vigilance	 of	 the	 officers	 in	 charge	 of	 the	 vessel	 in	 which	 they voyage! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Do	 they	 even	 think,	 I	 wondered,	 that	 while	 they	 are	 sleeping,	 eating, </p>
<p class="calibre1">enjoying	 themselves	 and	 doing	 what	 they	 please	 on	 board,	 even</p>
<p class="calibre1">grumbling	 at	 some	 little	 petty	 defect	 or	 shortcoming	 which	 they	 think</p>
<p class="calibre1">might	be	prevented,	the	engineers	below,	in	an	atmosphere	in	which	 <i class="calibre4">they</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 not	 breathe,	 are	 incessantly	 watching	 the	 movements	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">machinery	 and	 oiling	 each	 part	 at	 almost	 every	 instant	 of	 time,	 moving this	slide	and	that,	adjusting	a	valve	here	and	tightening	a	nut	there,	ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">cooling	the	bearings	and	raking	at	the	furnaces	and	putting	on	fresh	coal, </p>
<p class="calibre1">this	being	done	every	hour	of	the	day	and	night	through	the	passage	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">land	 to	 land?	 Have	 any	 of	 them	 realised	 the	 fact	 that	 these	 same</p>
<p class="calibre1">engineers	 and	 their	 able	 assistants,	 the	 firemen	 and	 oilmen	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">trimmers,	 the	 whole	 stoke-hold	 staff,	 so	 to	 speak,	 run	 a	 greater	 risk	 of their	 lives,	 in	 the	 event	 of	 an	 accident	 happening,	 than	 any	 one	 else	 in the	 ship,	 as,	 should	 a	 boiler	 or	 cylinder	 burst	 they	 may	 be	 scalded	 to death	 before	 the	 noise	 of	 the	 explosion	 could	 reach	 those	 above?	 Or</p>
<p class="calibre1">again,	 should	 the	 vessel	 strike	 on	 a	 rock,	 the	 compartment	 below	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	 perforce	 they	 are	 compelled	 to	 work	 deep	 down	 in	 the	 vessel’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">bowels	 will	 fill,	 from	 the	 very	 weight	 of	 the	 engines,	 quicker	 than	 any</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a>other	 part	 of	 the	 ship,	 most	 probably,	 when	 those	 confined	 below	 must necessarily	 be	 liable	 to	 be	 drowned,	 like	 rats	 in	 a	 hole,	 without	 the chances	of	escape	possessed	by	the	passengers	and	hands	on	board. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	don’t	suppose	any	one	even	thinks	of	such	things,”	said	I	to	myself</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	I	left	the	bridge	and	went	towards	the	saloon	to	ask	how	poor	Jackson</p>
<p class="calibre1">was,	 uttering	 my	 thoughts	 unconsciously	 aloud	 as	 I	 reflected,	 and	 now</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 I	 considered	 their	 responsibility,	 thought	 how	 much	 poor	 old	 Mr</p>
<p class="calibre1">Stokes,	with	his	broken	arm,	and	Stoddart	and	the	others	must	have	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	minds!	“Hullo,	who	is	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	Weston,	the	steward,	who	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 wish	 you’d	 come	 and	 look	 at	 Jackson,	 sir,”	 he	 said.	 “The	 poor	 chap wore	all	right	when	Mr	O’Neil	comed	down	jist	now,	and	a	sleepin’	still	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	 you	 seed	 him	 awhile	 ago.	 But	 all	 of	 a	 suddink	 he	 starts	 up	 as	 he hears	you	a	comin’	down	the	companion-way,	sir,	and	is	jabbering	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	anythink!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	but,”	I	exclaimed,	“why	did	you	leave	him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wor	afeard	he’d	jump	overboard,	or	try	to	do	somethink	awful!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nonsense!	the	very	thing	you	are	there	for	to	prevent,”	said	I,	going	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	cabin,	where	I	saw	the	poor	fellow	trying	to	get	out	of	the	cot.	Turning</p>
<p class="calibre1">angrily	to	Weston	I	repeated	again,	“You	shouldn’t	have	left	him	for	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment	in	this	state!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,	sir,	I	wanted	to	hail	Mr	O’Neil	or	somebody;	I	thought	I	oughter	’ave</p>
<p class="calibre1">summun	by	to	’elp	me,	in	case	he	becomed	desperate-like,	and	I	couldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">make	no	one	hear	on	deck,	and	that’s	why	I	comed	when	I	knowed	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	a-passing	along,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	unanswerable	logic,	though	Weston	always	had	an	answer	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything	and	everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poor	Jackson,	though,	did	not	look	as	if	he	would	be	“desperate”	again	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	shape	or	form. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 he	 was	 delirious	 I	 could	 see	 at	 a	 glance,	 for	 his	 eyes,	 great	 wild</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>eyes,	 were	 wide	 open,	 staring	 at	 vacancy,	 fixed	 on	 the	 bulkhead	 that divided	the	cabin	from	the	captain’s,	which	was	just	beyond;	and	he	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	 much	 excited,	 sitting	 up	 in	 the	 cot	 and,	 gesticulating	 violently	 with both	 his	 hands,	 and	 waving	 his	 arms	 about	 as	 he	 repeated	 some</p>
<p class="calibre1">unintelligible	gibberish	over	and	over	again,	that	I	could	not	make	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Presently	 he	 looked	 at	 me	 very	 straight	 as	 if	 he	 recognised	 me,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">afterwards	spoke	a	little	more	coherently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	yes,	sir,	I	recollect	now,”	he	said	at	last.	“You’re	Mr	Haldane,	I	know; </p>
<p class="calibre1">but—where’s	the	little	girl	and	the—the—dog?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why,	Jackson,	old	man,”	I	said,	speaking	soothingly	to	him,	“what’s	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter	with	you?	There’s	no	girl	or	dog,	you	know,	here.	Don’t	you	know</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	you	are,	my	poor	fellow?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	got	quite	savage	at	this.	There’s	no	reason	in	delirium! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	 course	 I	 know	 where	 I	 am,”	 he	 screamed	 out,	 making	 a	 grab	 at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Weston,	 as	 he	 writhed	 in	 torture	 from	 the	 internal	 and	 violent</p>
<p class="calibre1">inflammation	which	must	have	set	up.	“I’m	in—hell.	I—can—feel—I—am</p>
<p class="calibre1">—I	am—burning—all	over—inside	me—here.	And	you?	Oh,	yes—I	know</p>
<p class="calibre1">you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 paroxysm	 left	 him	 again	 after	 a	 moment,	 and	 he	 lay	 back	 on	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">pillows,	only	to	sit	up	the	next	minute	again,	however. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	now	pointed	his	finger	in	the	direction	of	the	sea	through	the	porthole, </p>
<p class="calibre1">gazing	earnestly	as	if	he	saw	something	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 ship	 has	 come	 for	 me	 again—as—it	 did	 t’other	 night—you	 know—</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	know?”	he	said	in	agonised	whispers.	“There—there,—can’t	you	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 now?	 sailing—along—as—Mister—Haldane—said,—there	 with	 a—a—</p>
<p class="calibre1">signal—of—distress—flying—the—flag—half-mast	 high!	 Why,—there	 it</p>
<p class="calibre1">is,—now,	as	plain	as—plain—can	be;	and,	see—see	they’re—lowering—</p>
<p class="calibre1">a—boat,—look,—for	me,—to	take	me	aboard.	Lend	us	a	hand,—mate.	I</p>

<p class="calibre1">—I’m—coming—I’m—comi-ing.	I’m—” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>Then,	 raising	 his	 eyes	 to	 heaven,	 and	 drawing	 a	 long	 deep	 breath, something	 between	 a	 sob	 and	 a	 sigh,	 a	 breath	 that	 was	 his	 last,	 poor Jackson	fell	back	on	the	pile	of	pillows	behind	him,	stone	dead! </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">We	Sight	the	Strange	Craft	again. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	number	one!”	said	old	Masters,	the	boatswain,	meeting	me	at	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">as	I	made	my	way	forward	to	the	bridge	to	inform	Captain	Applegarth	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	others	of	what	had	happened,	I	could	not	help	thinking	how	strange	it</p>

<p class="calibre1">Mr	Fosset,	or	some	of	the	hands	who	accompanied	him,	must	have	taken</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	the	yarn	to	the	stoke-hold,	only	just	before	the	unfortunate	man	met</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	his	terrible	accident,	though	I	had	no	doubt	that	he	must	have	seen</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 man-of-war	 through	 the	 port	 hole	 of	 the	 cabin,	 which	 was	 right</p>
<p class="calibre1">opposite	 his	 bunk,	 as	 she	 brought	 up	 under	 our	 stern	 to	 speak	 to	 us</p>
<p class="calibre1">earlier	 in	 the	 afternoon,	 and	 the	 sight	 of	  <i class="calibre4">HMS	 Aurora</i>	 had,	 somehow	 or other,	 amid	 the	 wanderings	 of	 his	 unconscious	 brain,	 got	 mixed	 up	 with the	remembrance	of	what	he	had	previously	heard	concerning	the	vessel</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	seen	at	sunset	the	two	days	prior. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	now	getting	dark,	the	evening	closing	in	quickly,	and,	what	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dying	 man’s	 queer	 talk	 and	 the	 boatswain	 harping	 on	 the	 same	 theme</p>
<p class="calibre1">immediately	 afterwards,	 I	 confess	 I	 felt	 far	 from	 comfortable,	 my	 nerves being	 in	 a	 state	 of	 constant	 tension	 from	 the	 painful	 scene	 in	 the	 cabin that	I	had	just	witnessed,	while	the	gloomy	shades	of	the	night	that	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">fast	 enwrapping	 us,	 the	 dull	 roar	 of	 the	 ever-breaking	 sea	 and	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">groaning	of	the	ship	as	she	rolled,	like	a	living	creature	in	pain,	all	worked</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	my	overtried	fancy	and	made	me	almost	afraid	of	my	own	shadow	as	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">slipped	 and	 stumbled	 along	 the	 sloppy	 deck,	 my	 mind	 being	 in	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">complete	whirl	till	I	reached	my	goal—the	bridge. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>“What’s	the	matther,	me	bhoy?”	asked	Garry	O’Neil,	who	was	speaking	to the	skipper,	the	two	examining	a	chart	in	the	wheel-house,	the	light	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 doorway	 of	 which	 fell	 on	 my	 face.	 “Faith,	 ye	 look	 quite	 skeared, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haldane,	jist	as	if	ye’d	sane	a	ghoast,	sure!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 mentioned	 what	 had	 happened,	 however,	 and	 he	 at	 once	 dropped	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">chaffing	manner,	looking	as	grave	as	a	judge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Begorrah,	 it’s	 moighty	 sorry	 I	 am	 to	 hear	 that,	 now!”	 said	 he	 in	 a	 more serious	tone.	“Sure,	and	he	was	a	foine,	h’ilthy	man	entirely,	barrin’	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">accident,	 bad	 cess	 to	 it!	 He	 moight	 have	 lived	 till	 a	 hundred,	 an’	 then aunly	 died	 of	 auld	 age;	 for	 he’d	 the	 constitution	 of	 an	 illiphent.	 Faith,	 I never	saw	such	a	chist	and	thorax	on	a	chap	in	me	loife	before!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Poor	fellow!”	observed	the	skipper.	“He	seems	to	have	gone	off	awfully</p>
<p class="calibre1">sudden	 at	 the	 last.	 I	 thought	 you	 said	 he	 was	 getting	 on	 well	 when	 you went	down	to	see	him	awhile	ago?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bedad,	I	did	that,	sir;	father’s	no	denyin’	it,”	answered	the	Irishman,	off-</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand.	 “But	 I	 niver	 s’id	 he’d	 git	 over	 it,	 cap’en.	 I	 tuld	 ye	 from	 the	 first	 he couldn’t	 reciver,	 for	 he	 was	 paralysed,	 poor	 craytur’,	 from	 the	 waist</p>
<p class="calibre1">downwards,	and	had	a	lot	of	internal	injury	besides.	It	was	aunly	bekase</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 was	 sich	 a	 shtrang	 man	 that	 he’s	 lasted	 so	 long,	 sir.	 Any	 one	 else would	 have	 died	 directly	 outright	 afther	 the	 accident,	 for	 he	 was	 pretty well	smashed	to	pieces!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Strange!”	 muttered	 Captain	 Applegarth,	 who,	 although	 hasty	 of	 temper</p>
<p class="calibre1">sometimes,	 was	 a	 man	 of	 deep	 feeling.	 “Sunday	 night	 again	 and	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	dead!	Only	a	week	ago,	this	very	evening,	he	came	up	to	me	here</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	I	was	standing	by	the	binnacle	to	ask	about	some	carpenter’s	stores</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 were	 wanted	 in	 the	 engine-room.	 He	 and	 I	 then	 got	 talking,	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">recollect,	 it	 being	 Sunday,	 I	 suppose,	 of	 religious	 matters.	 He	 imagined himself—poor	 chap—a	 ‘materialist,’	 as	 they	 call	 themselves,	 but	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">arguments	 on	 the	 point	 were	 very	 weak.	 He	 argued	 that	 there	 was	 no</p>
<p class="calibre1">hereafter,	no	future	state;	the	heaven	and	hell	spoken	of	in	Scripture,	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">suggested,	being	the	happiness	or	punishment	we	meet	with	below	here, </p>
<p class="calibre1">while	living,	in	accordance	with	our	own	lives.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith!”	 said	 Garry	 O’Neil,	 who	 was	 not	 a	 deep	 thinker,	 not	 troubling</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a>himself	 much	 about	 anything	 beyond	 the	 present.	 “That’s	 a	 puzzling question;	but	I,	for	one,	wouldn’t	care	to	be	of	that	way	of	thinkin’,	sure, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	question	however,	poor	Jackson	has	solved,	long	ere	this!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 Captain	 Applegarth	 uttered	 these	 words,	 solemnly	 enough,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fireman’s	ravings,	when	in	the	agonies	of	death,	came	back	to	me,	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought	that,	if	confident	in	his	materialism	when	in	health	and	strength, </p>
<p class="calibre1">his	creed	had	not	altogether	eased	his	mind	at	the	last,	when	I	saw	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">raise	his	eyes,	for	a	few	minutes,	to	heaven	in	prayer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 night	 the	 gale,	 which	 had	 moderated	 considerably	 during	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">afternoon,	 assailed	 us	 again	 with	 renewed	 vigour,	 as	 if	 old	 Boreas	 had put	a	fresh	hand	to	the	bellows,	as	sailor	folk	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 began	 in	 the	 middle	 watch,	 when	 the	 wind	 suddenly	 veered	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">southwards,	and	it	came	on	to	blow	great	guns,	causing	the	skipper	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">utmost	 uneasiness,	 as	 he	 feared	 we	 would	 break	 away	 from	 our	 spar</p>
<p class="calibre1">anchor,	when,	disabled	as	we	were,	a	steamer	in	a	storm	without	the	use</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 engines	 being	 no	 better	 off	 than	 a	 baby	 in	 arms	 deprived	 of	 its nurse,	it	seemed	almost	impossible	to	prevent	the	vessel	from	broaching-to,	in	which	case	she	would	more	than	likely	founder	with	all	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consequently,	 not	 a	 soul	 turned	 in	 the	 livelong	 night,	 the	 port	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">starboard	watches	 both	 remaining	 on	 duty,	 with	 Captain	 Applegarth	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr	Fosset	on	the	bridge,	while	Garry	O’Neil	relieved	the	boatswain,	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	had	eight	men	under	him	in	charge	of	the	wheel,	where	the	utmost</p>
<p class="calibre1">caution	 and	 the	 greatest	 vigilance	 were	 necessary	 to	 keep	 the	 old</p>
<p class="calibre1">barquey’s	 head	 to	 the	 sea.	 I	 had	 fearfully	 hard	 work,	 too,	 for	 the	 big waves	 ever	 and	 anon	 leapt	 up	 over	 her	 bows,	 burying	 the	 fo’c’s’le	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">clouds	 of	 spray	 and	 spent	 water	 that	 came	 pouring	 down	 into	 the	 waist and	 rushing	 aft,	 flooding	 the	 whole	 deck	 almost	 up	 to	 the	 gunwhales</p>
<p class="calibre1">taking	 everything	 movable	 overboard,	 the	 boats	 being	 lifted	 off	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">chocks	 amidships	 even	 and	 swept	 away,	 and	 the	 cook’s	 galley	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward	part	of	the	deckhouse	got	badly	damaged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	in	the	height	of	the	storm,	just	before	daybreak,	about	two	bells</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	morning	watch,	or	five	o’clock	AM. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>Our	 poor	 old	 barquey	 then	 rolled	 so	 much	 that	 the	 skipper	 thought	 the wire	 hawser	 attached	 to	 the	 spars	 had	 parted	 and	 that	 we	 were	 at	 the very	mercy	of	the	tempest.	So	certain,	indeed,	was	he,	that	he	yelled	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 all	 hands	 to	 make	 sail,	 with	 the	 idea	 of	 trying	 one	 last	 desperate venture	and	beard	the	winds	with	our	puny	canvas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fortunately,	 however,	 there	 was	 no	 need	 for	 us	 to	 essay	 this	 futile</p>
<p class="calibre1">expedient,	 breaking	 the	 force	 of	 the	 billows	 as	 they	 reared	 up	 in	 their colossal	 grandeur	 to	 annihilate	 us	 and	 keeping	 us	 steadily	 facing	 their attack;	and	presently,	shortly	after	six	bells,	when	we	really	experienced</p>
<p class="calibre1">pretty	 nearly	 the	 worst	 of	 it,	 there	 was	 a	 muttered	 growl	 of	 thunder, accompanied	 by	 a	 lightning	 flash	 that	 illuminated	 the	 whole	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">heavens	 from	 pole	 to	 pole,	 and	 then	 rain	 came	 down	 in	 a	 deluge,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wind	dropping,	as	suddenly,	with	a	wild,	weird	shrill	shriek	of	disappointed</p>
<p class="calibre1">rage	 that	 wailed	 and	 whistled	 through	 the	 rigging,	 and	 then	 quietly	 died away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	course	the	sea	did	not	quiet	down	all	at	once,	old	Neptune	not	being</p>
<p class="calibre1">easily	pacified	after	being	stirred	up	to	so	great	an	extent,	and	the	waves</p>
<p class="calibre1">ran	high	most	of	the	day,	while	the	sky	was	overcast	and	the	ocean	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">dull	leaden	colour;	but	towards	evening	it	cleared	up	and,	the	water	being</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	bit	calmer,	the	captain	thought	it	a	fitting	time	to	bury	poor	Jackson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 the	 hands	 were	 mustered	 on	 deck,	 the	 engineers	 and	 stokers</p>
<p class="calibre1">stopping	 their	 busy	 repairing	 work	 below,	 which	 they	 had	 kept	 at	 night and	 day	 without	 intermission	 ever	 since	 our	 breakdown,	 and	 coming	 up</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	rest	of	the	crew	to	pay	the	last	tribute	of	respect	to	their	departed</p>
<p class="calibre1">comrade,	 even	 Mr	 Stokes,	 though	 he	 was	 still	 in	 a	 very	 weak	 state	 of health	and	had	his	head	and	broken	arm	bandaged	up,	insisting	on	being</p>
<p class="calibre1">present,	Garry	O’Neil	and	Stoddart	supporting	him	between	them	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">purpose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 the	 body	 of	 the	 unfortunate	 fireman,	 enclosed	 in	 a	 hammock</p>
<p class="calibre1">covered	by	the	ship’s	ensign	and	having	a	pig	of	ballast	tied	to	the	feet	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">ensure	 its	 submersion,	 was	 brought	 up	 from	 the	 cabin	 where	 he	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">died,	 and	 placed	 on	 a	 plank	 by	 the	 gangway	 where	 the	 waves	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">washed	away	our	bulwarks,	leaving	a	wide	open	space. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	 Applegarth	 read	 over	 the	 remains	 the	 beautiful	 prayers	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a>Church	Service	appointed	for	the	burial	of	those	who	die	at	sea,	all	of	us standing	bareheaded	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	faint	gleam	of	light	from	the	setting	sun,	away	on	our	port	bow,	shone</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	 a	 mist	 of	 cloud	 that	 obscured	 the	 horizon	 to	 windward;	 and,	 as this	disappeared,	the	skipper	came	to	the	end	of	the	viaticum,	when,	at	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">signal	from	the	boatswain,	the	plank	was	tipped	and	poor	Jackson’s	body</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	committed	to	the	deep	with	a	sigh	of	regret	at	his	untimely	end,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 devout	 hope	 that	 though	 his	 earthly	 voyage	 had	 been	 cut	 short,	 he might	yet	reach	that	haven	where	there	are	no	accidents	nor	shipwrecks, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	where	seas	swallow	not	up,	or	stormy	winds	blow! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	little	while	after	this	a	slight	breeze	sprang	up	from	the	southward</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	westward,	bringing	a	cool	feeling	with	it,	and	I	shivered	as	I	stood	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 bridge	 looking	 out	 over	 the	 dark	 waste	 of	 waters,	 feeling	 rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">melancholy,	if	the	truth	be	told. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 a	 bad	 sign,	 Master	 Haldane,”	 said	 old	 Masters	 close	 to	 my	 ear, making	me	jump,	for	I	did	not	know	he	was	there.	“They	say	that	when	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">ship	chap	shivers	like	that	there,	it	be	meaning	that	somebody	or	summit</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	a-walking	over	his	grave!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stave	that,	bo’sun!”	I	cried	impatiently.	“You’re	a	regular	old	Jonah,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough	to	give	a	fellow	the	creeps!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	 you	 may	 try	 to	 laugh	 it	 off,	 Mister	 Haldane,”	 he	 retorted	 in	 his lugubrious	 way.	 “But,	 as	 I	 says	 to	 ye	 last	 night,	 says	 I,	 when	 that	 poor chap	 kicked	 the	 bucket	 as	 we’ve	 just	 been	 a-burying	 on,	 we	 ain’t	 seen the	end	on	it	yet.	I	misdoubts	the	weather,	too,	sir.	There’s	a	great	bank</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	cloud	now	rising	up	to	win’ard,	and	I	fancies	I	heard	jist	now	the	sound</p>
<p class="calibre1">o’	thunder	ag’in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thunder?”	I	exclaimed.	“Nonsense!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 Mister	 Haldane,	 it	 ain’t	 no	 nonsense,”	 said	 the	 old	 fellow	 solemnly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 ain’t	 known	 me	 to	 croak	 afore	 without	 re’sin,	 and	 I	 tells	 ye	 I	 don’t likes	 the	 look	 o’	 things	 to-night.	 There’s	 summit	 a-brewin’	 up	 over	 there, or	I’m	a	Dutchman!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	 that,	 bo’sun?”	 cried	 the	 skipper,	 coming	 up	 on	 the	 bridge	 at	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>moment	to	look	for	the	chart	of	the	North	Atlantic,	which	he	had	left	in	the wheel-house	 the	 night	 before,	 and	 overheard	 the	 old	 growler’s	 remark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Got	the	 <i class="calibre4">Flying	Dutchman</i>	on	the	brain	again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 sir,	 I	 weren’t	 talking	 o’	 that,”	 replied	 Masters.	 “I	 was	 a-saying	 to Master	 Haldane	 that	 it	 were	 precious	 misty	 and	 thick	 to	 win’ard	 and	 I feared	thunder	over	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thunder!	thunder	your	grandmother!”	cried	the	skipper	testily.	“I’ve	pretty</p>
<p class="calibre1">sharp	ears,	bo’sun,	and	I	have	heard	none	to-night.	Have	you,	Haldane?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“N–n–o,	sir,	not	thunder,”	I	answered,	listening	attentively	for	a	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stay,	 sir,	 though.	 I	 do	 hear	 something	 now,	 but	 the	 sound	 seems	 more like	firing	in	the	distance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What,	guns?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	sir,	more	like	rifle	shots,	or	the	discharge	of	a	revolver	firing	quickly	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">intervals.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	 Applegarth	 thereupon	 listened	 attentively,	 too,	 in	 his	 turn,	 while Masters	went	out	to	the	end	of	the	bridge	and	peered	out	over	the	side	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">windward	with	rapt	gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	George,	yes,	you’re	right,	boy!”	cried	the	skipper	the	next	moment.	“I</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	 hear	 the	 shots	 quite	 plainly,	 I	 do	 believe.	 Hullo,	 there!	 What	 the deuce	is	going	on	over	there,	I	wonder?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	reason	for	exclamation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	that	instant	the	dark	mass	of	cloud	on	the	horizon,	towards	which	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	all	looking,	was	rent	by	a	flash,	and	we	could	see,	standing	against</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 black	 background	 in	 vivid	 relief,	 the	 masts	 and	 spars	 of	 a	 large	 full-rigged	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 was	 evidently	 burning	 a	 “flare-up”	 to	 attract	 attention,	 and,	 ere	 the light	waned,	I	noticed	that	her	yards	were	all	a	cock-bill	and	her	sails	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">rigging	torn	and	disordered;	while,	stranger	still,	she	had	her	flag	astern</p>
<p class="calibre1">hoisted	half-mast	high—the	French	tricolour,	too! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a>Both	 the	 boatswain	 and	 I,	 simultaneously,	 involuntarily,	 uttered	 a	 cry	 of dismay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 vessel	 in	 sight	 was	 the	 very	 identical	 ship	 I	 had	 seen	 three	 nights before,	flying	the	same	signal	of	distress;	and	here	she	was	now,	sailing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 then,	 four	 points	 off	 our	 weather	 bows	 and	 eight	 before	 the	 wind, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which	 was,	 as	 I’ve	 already	 said,	 blowing	 a	 light	 breeze	 from	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">southward	and	westward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	new	calamity	did	this	second	appearance	of	the	“ghost-ship,”	as	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">old	boatswain	called	her,	portend	to	all	of	us? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aye,	what,	indeed! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Time	alone	could	tell. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Ten. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Mystification. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Old	 Masters	 turned	 his	 face	 towards	 me	 as	 the	 fleeting	 vision	 became</p>
<p class="calibre1">swallowed	 up	 in	 the	 darkness	 that	 now	 obscured	 the	 sky	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">westwards,	 and	 I	 saw	 that	 he	 looked	 horror-struck,	 staring	 into	 space</p>
<p class="calibre1">spell-bound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	for	me,	I	cannot	express	what	I	felt,	because	I	am	unable	to	describe	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">fully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There,	 there!”	 I	 exclaimed,	 clutching	 Captain	 Applegarth’s	 arm	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">nervous	horror.	“There	she	is	again!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 the	 skipper,	 although	 startled	 by	 the	 sudden	 appearance	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mysterious	 vessel	 in	 the	 first	 instance,	 as	 his	 ejaculation	 on	 catching sight	of	her	showed,	evidently	did	not	regard	her	in	the	same	light	as	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">boatswain	and	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why,	Haldane,	what’s	the	matter	with	you,	my	lad?”	he	said	in	a	joking</p>
<p class="calibre1">way,	“You	seem	all	of	a	tremble;	and,	by	George,	you	grip	tight!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p70"></a>“I	 beg	 your	 pardon,	 sir,	 I’m	 sure,”	 I	 stammered	 out,	 trying	 to	 pull	 myself together	 as	 I	 released	 his	 arm.	 “But—but—did	 you—did	 you—see	 her, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See	 that	 ship	 just	 now?	 Yes,	 of	 course	 I	 did.	 I	 suppose	 she	 sighted	 us lying	 here	 like	 a	 log	 and	 wanted	 us	 to	 report	 her	 or	 something,	 though why	 they	 lit	 that	 flare-up	 over	 her	 stern	 I	 am	 sure	 I	 can’t	 imagine.	 They couldn’t	 expect	 us	 to	 read	 her	 name	 at	 that	 distance.	 She	 must	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	close	on	five	miles	off!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,	sir,”	I	cried	out	quickly.	“She’s	the	same!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	same	what,	Haldane?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why,	the	ship	in	distress,	sir,	that	I	sighted	at	sunset	on	Friday	night	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	our	breakdown.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Applegarth	whistled	through	his	teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	good	lad,”	he	said	incredulously,	“that’s	simply	impossible!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	sir,	you	may	not	believe	me,”	I	urged,	rather	nettled	that	he	should</p>
<p class="calibre1">put	me	down	in	this	way,	“but	I	declare	to	you	she	is	the	identical	vessel	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">saw	that	evening,	as	I	told	you	at	the	time,	and	of	which	we	went	in	chase</p>
<p class="calibre1">till	 the	 gale	 stopped	 us	 and	 our	 machinery	 gave	 out!	 I	 cannot	 doubt	 the evidence	of	my	own	eyes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	dear	boy,”	replied	the	skipper,	in	kinder	tones	than	I	expected	to	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">outburst,	for	he	was	a	hot-tempered	man	generally,	and	disliked	anything</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	argument	from	his	officers	when	he	had	once	said	his	say,	being	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 opinion	 that	 his	 word	 should	 be	 last.	 “Just	 reflect	 a	 moment	 and	 let your	 own	 natural	 good	 sense	 decide	 the	 point.	 How	 can	 it	 be	 likely	 that the	vessel	you	asserted	you	saw	on	Friday	night,	hundreds	of	miles	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 here,	 should	 come	 across	 us	 now	 under	 precisely	 similar</p>
<p class="calibre1">circumstances,	considering	all	that	has	happened	since?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	the	same	ship,	sir,	nevertheless,”	I	maintained	stubbornly,	though	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 a	 bit	 puzzled	 on	 my	 own	 account,	 mind,	 by	 his	 putting	 the	 case	 so strongly.	“The	vessel	I	saw	on	Friday	night	was	a	full-rigged	ship,	with	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">sails	 knocked	 about	 and	 had	 her	 ensign	 hoisted	 half-mast	 high	 at	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>peak,	and	this	one	seemed	the	same	in	every	particular.	I	did	not	notice all	 that	 when	 she	 burnt	 the	 flare-up	 just	 now.	 The	 light	 only	 lasted	 an instant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	 is	 something	 in	 that,	 certainly,	 Haldane,”	 answered	 the	 skipper, </p>
<p class="calibre1">wavering	 a	 little,	 I	 thought,	 in	 his	 ideas.	 “Still,	 when	 one	 is	 inclined	 to believe	 in	 a	 thing,	 the	 imagination	 is	 often	 a	 great	 aid	 in	 turning	 a	 wish into	a	certainty.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Besides,	 sir,”	 I	 continued,	 wishing	 to	 clench	 my	 argument,	 “if	 we	 were driven	 out	 of	 our	 course	 by	 the	 gale,	 she	 might	 have	 been	 similarly</p>
<p class="calibre1">affected,	 and	 the	 winds	 and	 currents	 might	 have	 brought	 us	 together</p>
<p class="calibre1">again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	possible,	but	not	probable,”	he	rejoined.	“I’ve	known	two	bottles	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 same	 weight	 dropped	 overboard	 from	 the	 same	 ship	 at	 the	 same</p>
<p class="calibre1">hour,	and—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	was	found	landed	on	the	Lofoden	Isles,	off	the	coast	of	Norway:	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">other	came	ashore	at	Sandy	Point,	in	the	Straits	of	Magellan!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	laughed	when	he	said	this,	apparently	thinking	he	had	utterly	settled</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	matter,	but	I	checkmated	him	with	his	own	theory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 very	 uncertainty	 of	 the	 action	 of	 the	 currents	 of	 the	 Atlantic	 which you	instance,	sir,”	I	said,	“shows	that	what	you	think	impossible	might	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	possible,	and	the	strange,	weird	vessel	that	I	saw	three	nights	ago</p>
<p class="calibre1">might	have	come	within	sight	of	us	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 one	 for	 you,	 Haldane,”	 acknowledged	 the	 skipper	 very	 good-</p>
<p class="calibre1">naturedly,	 for	 he	 was	 a	 fair	 man	 when	 anything	 was	 laid	 clearly	 before him.	“But,	recollect,	no	one	saw	this	ship	distinctly	but	yourself.	I	couldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">say	of	my	own	knowledge	what	rig	she	was,	and	I	certainly	didn’t	see	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">flag	 or	 sign	 of	 distress.	 I	 only	 saw	 something	 that	 looked	 like	 a	 ship burning	a	flare-up	in	the	distance—that’s	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Beg	 pardon,	 sir,”	 whispered	 old	 Masters,	 stepping	 up	 and	 touching	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">cap	ere	he	addressed	the	skipper,	“but	I	seed	the	ghost-ship,	too,	sir,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a>same	as	Master	Haldane,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	skipper	wheeled	round	and	stared	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ghost-ship,	man!	What	do	you	mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	means	that	there	ghost-ship	that	hove	in	sight	jist	now	and	which	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">passed	us	afore,	sir.	She	be	sent	as	a	warning	to	us,	I	knows,	and	as	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christian	man,	Cap’en	Applegarth,	I	takes	it	as	sich!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 old	 seaman	 spoke	 so	 earnestly	 that	 the	 skipper,	 although	 he	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">hard	 work	 to	 keep	 himself	 in,	 answered	 him	 without	 ridiculing	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">extraordinary	delusion,	as	he	held	it	to	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	a	Christian	man,	too,	I	hope,	bo’sun,”	he	said.	“I	believe	in	a	divine</p>
<p class="calibre1">power	 above,	 and	 put	 my	 trust	 in	 a	 merciful	 providence;	 but	 I	 can’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe	in	any	of	your	queer	supernatural	visitations,	whether	as	warnings</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	what	not!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	if	you	seed	the	same	blessed	thing	three	times?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No;	not	if	I	saw	it	a	hundred	times!”	he	roared	out	impatiently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	seein’	is	believin’,	I	says,”	whined	old	Masters,	not	a	whit	shaken	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 point,	 in	 spite	 of	 the	 skipper’s	 scepticism.	 “Master	 Haldane	 seed	 it, and	I	seed	it,	and	poor	Jackson	seed	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Indeed?”	cried	the	skipper.	“I	did	not	know	he	had	been	on	deck	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	accident.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 wore	 arter	 that,	 sir,	 that	 he	 seed	 the	 ghost-ship,”	 said	 the	 old</p>
<p class="calibre1">boatswain	in	reply	to	the	implied	question.	“It	were	jist	afore	he	died.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	 before	 he	 died!”	 repeated	 Captain	 Applegarth	 indignantly,	 as	 if	 he thought	he	was	being	made	a	fool	of.	“Why,	man,	the	poor	fellow	was	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	his	mind	then,	and	besides,	never	stirred	out	of	his	cabin!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	but	he	had	the	warnin’	jist	the	same,	for	Weston,	it	was,	told	me	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">how	 Jackson	 seed	 the	 ship	 and	 cried	 out	 when	 he	 lay	 there	 a-dyin’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bulkheads	can’t	keep	sperrits	out,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a>“Nor	 in,	 either,	 as	 I	 know	 to	 my	 cost,”	 returned	 the	 skipper	 drily.	 “Your friend	Weston	is	pretty	familiar	with	them,	if	they	come	in	his	way,	I	fancy! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stuff	 and	 nonsense,	 bo’sun;	 how	 can	 you	 believe	 such	 rubbish?	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">other	 night	 you	 imagined	 the	 reflection	 of	 our	 own	 vessel,	 when	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">meteor	 came	 by,	 to	 be	 a	 ghost-ship,	 as	 you	 call	 it	 in	 your	 absurd	 folly; and	to-night,	when	that	craft	to	win’rd	passed	and	lit	a	flare-up,	hanged	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	aren’t	at	it	again	with	your	ghost-ship!	By	George,	it	makes	me	sick, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Masters,	 to	 think	 that	 a	 grown	 man	 and	 a	 good	 seaman	 like	 yourself</p>
<p class="calibre1">should	be	such	a	confounded	ass!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hass	or	no	hass,	there	she	wer’,”	said	the	old	fellow	doggedly.	“But	here</p>
<p class="calibre1">comes	Mr	Fosset,	sir.	He	were	on	the	poop	aft	when	that	vessel	passed</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	I	speaks	on.	Ax	him	what	he	thinks	of	her	and	if	she	weren’t	the	same</p>
<p class="calibre1">full-rigged	ship	as	Master	Haldane	and	all	of	us	seed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 will,”	 replied	 Captain	 Applegarth	 promptly;	 and	 on	 the	 first	 mate</p>
<p class="calibre1">approaching	 nearer,	 he	 hailed	 him.	 “I	 say,	 Fosset,	 what	 did	 you	 think	 of that	ship	just	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	other’s	answer,	however,	bewildered	the	skipper	more	than	Masters</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I	had	done	previously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ship!”	said	the	first	mate.	“What	ship?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	vessel	that	lit	the	flare-up	awhile	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 didn’t	 see	 any	 flare-up!”	 replied	 Mr	 Fosset,	 “and	 certainly	 no	 ship	 has passed	us	to	my	knowledge	since	I’ve	been	on	deck.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	 George,	 I	 don’t	 know	 who	 or	 what	 to	 believe,”	 exclaimed	 Captain</p>
<p class="calibre1">Applegarth,	looking	from	the	one	to	the	other	of	us.	“You’ve	set	my	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">brains	 wool-gathering	 between	 you,	 with	 your	 ‘vessels	 in	 distress’	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘ghost-ships’;	I’m	hanged	if	I	won’t	go	down	to	the	engine-room	and	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 little	 practical	 common	 sense	 knocked	 into	 me,	 as	 well	 as	 see	 how</p>
<p class="calibre1">they’re	getting	on	with	the	repairs	to	the	machinery!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	 saying,	 the	 skipper	 went	 below,	 and,	 as	 there	 was	 nothing	 particular for	me	to	do	on	deck,	I	followed	his	example.	Instead	of	proceeding	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 engine-room,	 however,	 I	 only	 went	 as	 far	 as	 my	 bunk	 and	 turned in,	wondering	what	the	morrow	would	bring	forth.	I	was	haunted,	though, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a>by	strange	dreams	all	through	the	night,	continually	waking	up	and	then getting	 to	 sleep	 again	 in	 snatches,	 only	 to	 wake	 up	 again	 immediately</p>
<p class="calibre1">after	I	had	dropped	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Eleven. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">In	the	Gulf	Stream. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 a	 dead	 calm,	 sir!”	 I	 heard	 Mr	 Fosset	 sing	 out	 next	 morning	 outside the	 door	 of	 the	 skipper’s	 state	 room,	 which	 opened	 out	 of	 the	 saloon, close	to	my	berth,	when	he	went	to	call	him	at	four	bells,	in	obedience	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">orders	 given	 overnight.	 “The	 gale	 has	 completely	 blown	 itself	 out,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">there’s	only	a	little	cat’s-paw	of	a	breeze	from	the	south’ard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Humph!”	 yawned	 the	 skipper	 from	 within.	 “That’s	 a	 good	 job,	 Fosset.	 I think	we’ve	had	enough	wind	to	last	us	for	a	blue	moon!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	say	I,	sir,”	agreed	the	other	with	much	heartiness.	“I	wouldn’t	like	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">go	through	the	same	experiences	again,	by	Jingo!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nor	I,”	came	from	the	other,	evidently	about	to	turn	out	from	his	bunk.	“I’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	on	deck	in	five	minutes	or	so,	Fosset.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 first	 mate,	 however,	 would	 not	 take	 this	 for	 a	 dismissal,	 having</p>
<p class="calibre1">apparently	 further	 important	 information	 to	 give	 and	 which	 he	 at	 once</p>
<p class="calibre1">proceeded	to	disclose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	 you	 know,	 sir,	 I	 think	 we’re	 in	 the	 Gulf	 Stream,”	 he	 said	 in	 an impressive	 tone.	 “There’s	 a	 lot	 of	 the	 weed	 knocking	 about	 round	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ship.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gulf-weed?”	 exclaimed	 the	 skipper’s	 voice	 again	 from	 the	 cabin, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sounding	a	bit	muffled	as	if	he	were	in	the	act	of	pulling	his	shirt	over	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">head.	“Are	you	certain?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,”	affirmed	the	other.	“There’s	not	the	slightest	doubt	about	it.	It’s	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">plain	as	a	pike	staff,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a>“The	 deuce	 it	 is!”	 said	 the	 skipper	 in	 a	 louder	 key,	 showing	 that	 my surmise	 had	 been	 correct	 as	 to	 the	 progress	 of	 his	 toilet,	 and	 that	 his head	 was	 now	 unloosed	 from	 its	 bag-like	 envelope.	 “By	 George,	 I	 can’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">make	it	out	at	all!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	 no	 getting	 over	 the	 fact,	 sir,”	 persisted	 the	 first	 mate.	 “We’re quite	surrounded	by	the	weed.	I	saw	it	well	the	first	streak	of	light	at	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">bells,	on	suddenly	looking	over	the	side,	sir.	There’s	Mr	O’Neil	up	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bridge	now,	and	he	has	noticed	it	too!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 skipper,	 to	 judge	 from	 the	 voice	 that	 came	 from	 his	 cabin	 and	 the way	 he	 was	 banging	 his	 boots	 and	 other	 things	 about,	 was	 as	 much</p>
<p class="calibre1">mystified	by	Mr	Fosset’s	unexpected	announcement	as	he	had	been	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">previous	evening	by	the	sight	he	and	I	and	the	boatswain	had	seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	also	angry,	I	know,	so	I	thought	it	good	for	me	to	turn	out	likewise</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 my	 bunk	 as	 speedily	 as	 possible,	 it	 not	 being	 advisable	 under	 the circumstances	to	be	“caught	napping.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	George,	 I	 can’t	 understand	 it!”	 repeated	 Captain	 Applegarth	 crossly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	 we’re	 in	 the	 Gulf	 Stream,	 all	 I	 can	 say	 is,	 we	 must	 have	 drifted	 a wonderful	distance	in	the	last	two	or	three	days.	Why,	man,	the	current	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">seldom	perceptible	above	the	fortieth	parallel!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	that,	sir,”	replied	the	first	mate;	“but	if	you	recollect,	sir,	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lunar	observation	Mr	O’Neil	took	on	the	night	of	the	breakdown,	we	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">then	as	far	south	as	41°	30	minutes,	and	we’ve	been	drifting	south-east</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	east	ever	since.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 Fosset,	 I’m	 hanged	 if	 I	 know	 where	 we	 are,	 after	 the	 bucketting-about	we’ve	had	since	last	Friday!”	said	the	skipper,	who	now	came	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 saloon,	 where	 I,	 already	 dressed,	 was	 hurriedly	 having	 a	 cup	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">cocoa	and	bite	of	biscuit	Weston	had	just	brought	me	in	from	the	pantry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	feel	half	inclined	to	believe	now	in	the	old	superstition	about	it	being	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">unlucky	day,	though	I	always	used	to	laugh	at	the	notion!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	are	plenty	aboard	who	believe	queerer	things	than	that!”	said	Mr</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fosset	drily,	with	a	meaning	glance	in	my	direction,	eyeing	my	cocoa	as	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	rather	fancied	a	cup	himself.	“I	say,	Haldane,	that	cocoa	smells	good!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>“It’s	 not	 half	 bad,	 sir,”	 I	 replied	 grinning.	 “Perhaps	 you	 would	 like	 some too,	 sir.	 Weston’s	 got	 a	 lot	 more	 inside	 here,	 hot,	 just	 fetched	 from	 the galley!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	mind	if	I	do	have	a	cup,”	said	he.	“Will	you	join	me,	cap’en?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 thanks;	 I’m	 too	 worried.	 I’ll	 wait	 till	 breakfast,”	 said	 the	 skipper, turning	to	go	up	on	deck	by	the	companion-way	and	hitching	his	cap	off</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	hook	by	his	cabin	door.	“You	won’t	be	long,	I	hope,	eh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	follow	you	up	in	a	jiffey,	sir,	as	soon	as	I	have	swallowed	a	toothful	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	warm	stuff	to	keep	out	the	cold.	Hi,	steward?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	 aye,	 sir?”	 answered	 Weston,	 promptly	 putting	 his	 head	 out	 of	 his pantry,	where	he	had	been	listening.	“Cup	of	cocoa,	sir?—yezzir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 say,	 Fosset,”	 said	 the	 captain,	 who	 had	 lingered	 near	 awhile,	 as	 if	 in deep	 thought,	 as	 he	 stood	 with	 one	 foot	 on	 the	 lower	 step	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">companion	 as	 if	 he	 were	 trying	 to	 recollect	 something,	 “I	 say,	 we	 must make	some	points	to-day	on	the	chart,	you	know!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.	I	don’t	think	there’ll	be	any	difficulty	about	that.	Do	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No;	 the	 sun	 ought	 to	 be	 pretty	 clear	 at	 noon	 with	 a	 morning	 like	 this—</p>
<p class="calibre1">clear	enough,	at	all	events,	for	us	to	find	out	the	latitude	and	longitude.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	 what	 I	 said	 to	 Spokeshave,	 sir,	 before	 I	 came	 down	 to	 call	 you awhile	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quite	so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	‘quite	so,’	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whereupon	 both	 sniggered	 at	 the	 skipper’s	 apt	 mimicry	 of	 Master</p>
<p class="calibre1">Conky’s	 pet	 phrase,	 which	 Captain	 Applegarth	 pronounced	 in	 the	 little</p>
<p class="calibre1">beggar’s	 exact	 tone	 of	 voice,	 so	 like	 indeed	 being	 the	 imitation	 that	 I nearly	 choked	 myself	 while	 swallowing	 the	 balance	 of	 my	 cocoa,	 as	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">hastily	drained	my	cup	and	rose	to	follow	the	skipper	up	the	companion-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ladder	to	the	deck. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a>As	Mr	Fosset	had	said,	there	was	a	dead	calm	on	the	bosom	of	the	deep, for	the	slight	swell	that	remained	after	the	gale	on	the	previous	evening, </p>
<p class="calibre1">even	up	to	the	time	of	my	going	down	below,	had	quite	disappeared,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">surface	of	the	water	being	as	smooth	as	glass	as	far	as	the	horizon	line</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	all	aflash	now	with	the	rosy	hue	of	sunrise	to	the	eastward.	The	sky</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	preserved,	however,	the	pale	neutral	tints	of	night	in	the	west,	and	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	zenith,	where	it	merged	into	a	faint	and	beautiful	seagreen	that	lost</p>
<p class="calibre1">itself	 imperceptibly	 in	 the	 warm	 colouring	 of	 the	 orient,	 which	 each</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment	became	more	and	more	intense	in	hue,	heralding	the	approach</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	morn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 last,	 up	 jumped	 the	 glorious	 orb	 of	 day,	 proudly,	 from	 his	 ocean	 bed, came	with	one	bound	as	it	were,	a	veritable	globe	of	liquid	fire,	flooding</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	vast	distant	heaven	and	sea	with	a	wealth	of	light	and	radiance	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	to	give	life	to	everything	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There,	Haldane,”	said	Captain	Applegarth,	pointing	over	the	taffrail	at	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">lot	 of	 straggling	 masses	 of	 quasi-looking	 stringy	 stuff	 that	 came	 floating on	 top	 of	 the	 water	 close	 by	 the	 ship,	 resembling	 vegetable	 refuse</p>
<p class="calibre1">discarded	 from	 Neptune’s	 kitchen	 garden.	 “That’s	 the	 gulf-weed	 Mr</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fosset	was	just	speaking	about	to	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Indeed,	 sir,	 I	 can’t	 say	 much	 for	 its	 appearance.	 It	 looks	 more	 like	 a parcel	of	cauliflowers	run	to	seed	than	anything	else,	sir!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	that’s	not	a	bad	simile	of	yours,	my	lad,”	he	replied,	moving	nearer</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	side	and	sending	his	keen	sailorly	glance	alow	and	aloft,	examining</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	old	barquey	to	see	how	she	fared	after	the	storm.	“If	I	can	remember</p>
<p class="calibre1">rightly,	I	think	one	of	our	best	naturalists	has	given	a	similar	description	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">it.	 Yes,	 that’s	 the	 gulf-weed,	 or	 sargassum,	 or	  <i class="calibre4">fucus	 natans</i>,	 as	 the	 big guns	variously	call	it	in	their	Latin	lingo.	A	rum	sort	of	tackle,	isn’t	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 it	 does	 look	 funny,	 queer	 stuff,	 sir,”	 said	 I,	 for	 I	 had	 never	 had	 the opportunity	 of	 noticing	 it	 before,	 all	 my	 voyages	 hitherto	 backwards	 and forwards	 across	 the	 Atlantic	 having	 been	 outside	 the	 limits	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">uncanny	looking	gulf-weed.	“Does	it	grow	in	the	sea,	sir?	It	looks	so	fresh</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	green.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	that	depends	how	you	take	it,	my	lad,”	returned	the	skipper	rather</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a>absently,	his	attention	being	fixed	on	something	forward,	about	which	he evidently	could	not	quite	make	up	his	mind,	as	there	was	a	slight	puzzled</p>
<p class="calibre1">expression	 on	 his	 face.	 “You	 see,	 it	 is	 all	 through	 those	 long-winded</p>
<p class="calibre1">chaps	who	won’t	be	content	with	what	the	Creator	gives	them,	but	must</p>
<p class="calibre1">put	 a	 cause	 and	 reason	 for	 everything	 beyond	 God’s	 own	 will	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleasure,	and	who	lay	down	arbitrary	rules	of	their	own	for	the	guidance</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	Dame	Nature,	though,	between	you	and	I	and	the	binnacle,	Haldane, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	old	lady	got	on	well	enough	for	a	good	many	scores	of	years—I’d	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">sorry	 to	 say	 how	 many—without	 their	 precious	 help!	 Now	 these</p>
<p class="calibre1">gentlemen,	 who	 know	 everything,	 will	 have	 it	 that	 the	 gulf-weed	 grows</p>
<p class="calibre1">deep	 down	 at	 the	 bottom	 of	 the	 sea	 and	 that	 only	 the	 branches	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">tendrils,	or	leaves,	so	to	speak,	float	on	the	top	and	are	visible	to	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	strange,	sir,”	said	I.	“Just	like	an	aquarium	plant.	It	is	strange!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 would	 be,	 if	 true,	 for	 they	 would	 have	 to	 possess	 uncommonly	 long stems,	 as,	 in	 the	 Sagossa	 Sea,	 in	 the	 centre	 of	 the	 Gulf	 Stream,	 where the	 weed	 is	 most	 plentiful	 and	 to	 be	 seen	 at	 its	 freshest	 and	 most</p>
<p class="calibre1">luxuriant	growth,	the	recorded	depth	of	the	water	is	over	four	miles!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	is	not	likely,	then,”	I	observed	in	reply	to	this—“I	mean,	sir,	the	fact</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	its	growing	up	from	the	bottom	of	the	sea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly	 not,	 my	 boy.	 Another	 wise	 man,	 of	 the	 same	 kidney	 as	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">long-winded	 chap	 of	 the	 theory	 I’ve	 just	 explained,	 says	 that	 the	 gulf-weed	 in	 its	 natural	 and	 original	 state	 grows	 on	 the	 rocky	 islets	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">promontories	of	the	Florida	coast	and	that	it	is	torn	thence	by	the	action</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 great	 Atlantic	 current	 that	 bears	 it	 many	 miles	 from	 its	 home; though,	 strangely	 enough,	 I	 have	 never	 seen	 any	 gulf-weed	 growing	 on</p>
<p class="calibre1">rocks	 in	 the	 Gulf	 of	 Florida	 or	 in	 any	 of	 the	 adjacent	 seas,	 nor	 has	 any one	else	to	my	knowledge!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	you	do	not	believe	it	grows	to	anything	at	all,	do	you,	sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 I	 don’t.	 My	 opinion	 is	 that	 it	 is	 a	 surface	 plant	 of	 old	 Neptune’s rearing	 and	 that	 the	 warm	 water	 of	 the	 Gulf	 Stream	 breeds	 it	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">nourishes	it,	for	at	certain	times	it	seems	partly	withered,	and	this	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	be	due	to	accident.	The	weed,	I	believe,	is	a	sailor,	like	you	and	I,	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">lad,	 and	 lives	 and	 has	 its	 being	 on	 the	 sea,	 no	 matter	 what	 your</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a>longshore	 naturalists,	 who	 don’t	 know	 much	 about	 it	 from	 personal observation,	 may	 say	 to	 the	 contrary.	 Hullo!	 though,	 my	 boy,	 look	 forrad there!	 Where	 has	 our	 spar	 anchor	 gone?	 I	 thought	 I	 noticed	 something</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 could	 not	 make	 out	 at	 first	 what	 it	 was.	 Look,	 youngster,	 and	 see whether	you	can	see	it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	equally	puzzled	for	the	moment,	for	although	our	good	ship	rested</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 peacefully	 on	 the	 bosom	 of	 the	 deep	 as	 if	 she	 were	 moored,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">raftlike	 bundle	 of	 spars,	 to	 which	 she	 had	 been	 made	 fast	 the	 night</p>
<p class="calibre1">before,	 was	 now	 no	 longer	 to	 be	 seen	 bobbing	 up	 ahead,	 athwart	 our</p>
<p class="calibre1">hawser	as	then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where	could	our	wonderful	floating	anchor	have	gone? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	moment,	however,	I	saw	what	had	happened,	the	mystery	being</p>
<p class="calibre1">easily	explained	by	the	calm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ve	floated	alongside,	sir,”	I	said.	“I	can	see	them	under	the	counter</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	port	side,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 of	 course,	 there	 they	 are,	 exemplifying	 the	 attraction	 of	 gravitation or	 some	 other	 long-winded	 theory	 of	 your	 scientific	 gentlemen,”	 replied</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	skipper,	who	seemed	to	have	got	science	on	the	brain	this	morning, </p>
<p class="calibre1">being	violently	antagonistic	to	it,	somehow	or	other.	“Ah,	Fosset,	see,	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">anchor’s	 come	 home	 without	 weighing.	 I	 think	 you’d	 better	 have	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">spars	 hauled	 on	 board	 and	 rig	 up	 the	 sticks	 again,	 now	 that	 they’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">served	our	time	in	another	way—aye,	and	served	it	well,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	aye,	sir,”	said	the	first	mate,	who	had	come	up	after	us	on	the	poop, </p>
<p class="calibre1">looking,	 I	 couldn’t	 help	 noticing,	 all	 the	 better	 for	 the	 good	 and	 early breakfast	he	had	just	finished.	“I	thought	of	getting	them	in	just	now,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">waited	to	call	you	first.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 you	 needn’t	 wait	 any	 longer,	 Fosset,”	 rejoined	 the	 skipper.	 “Pass the	word	for	the	bo’sun	forrad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	yes,	sir.	Quartermaster,	call	Masters!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bo’sun,	pipe	all	hands	to	hoist	spars	aboard!”	These	orders	were	roared</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	 by	 Mr	 Fosset	 in	 rapid	 succession,	 and	 then	 in	 equally	 rapid</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>sequences	 came	 the	 boatswain’s	 whistle	 and	 hail	 to	 the	 men	 down	 the hatchway	just	along	the	deck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	had	a	rare	time	of	it,	and	an	amount	of	“yoho-hoes-hoing”	went	round</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	it	would	have	done	anybody’s	heart	good	to	hear;	the	first	mate	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">bellowing	out	his	orders	and	old	Masters	seeing	to	their	proper	execution</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	the	busy	hands	and	active	feet,	the	skipper	meanwhile	standing	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">poop,	 superintending	 matters	 with	 his	 keen	 eye,	 and	 woe	 to	 the	 lubber</p>
<p class="calibre1">who	bungled	at	a	hitch	or	left	a	rope’s	end	loose	or	brace	slack! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Twelve. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Boat	Ahoy! </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">By	the	time	the	sun	was	near	the	meridian	our	top-masts	were	up	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">upper	 yards	 swayed	 aloft	 and	 crossed,	 making	 the	 old	 barquey	 all</p>
<p class="calibre1">ataunto	 again	 and	 pretty	 nearly	 her	 old	 self,	 our	 broken	 bulwarks	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">smashed	skylight	betraying	the	only	damage	done	by	the	storm,	on	deck, </p>
<p class="calibre1">at	all	events. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	‘calculate,’	Fosset,	as	our	Yankee	friends	would	say,	we	may	now	cry</p>
<p class="calibre1">spell	O!”	observed	the	skipper,	who	was	highly	pleased	with	the	progress</p>
<p class="calibre1">made	in	refitting	the	ship.	“Tell	the	bo’sun	to	pipe	the	hands	to	dinner,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	and	I	had	better	go	up	on	the	bridge	and	see	what	we	can	do	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	 of	 determining	 our	 position	 on	 the	 chart.	 That	 gulf-weed	 must	 have lost	its	bearings,	I’m	sure.	It	seems	impossible	to	me	that	we	could	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">drifted	so	far	to	the	south	as	to	bring	us	in	the	Stream!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An	 observation	 will	 soon	 settle	 the	 point,	 sir,”	 replied	 the	 first	 mate, passing	the	word	to	Masters	to	knock	off	work.	“Run	down,	Haldane,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	my	sextant	for	me,	there’s	a	good	chap!	I	left	it	on	the	cabin	table,	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">ready.	You’ll	find	it	there!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Belay,	 there!”	 sang	 out	 the	 skipper,	 as	 I	 started	 off	 towards	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">companion-way.	“You	may	as	well	bring	mine,	too,	while	you’re	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	heads	are	better	than	one,	eh,	Fosset?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 sir,	 perhaps	 so,”	 rejoined	 the	 other,	 before	 I	 got	 out	 of	 earshot.	 “It</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>seems,	though,	as	if	we’re	going	to	have	three	on	the	job;	for	here	comes Mr	 O’Neil	 with	 his	 sextant	 under	 his	 arm,	 evidently	 bent	 on	 the	 same</p>
<p class="calibre1">errand!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	soon	was	back	with	the	instruments	for	the	other	two,	and	presently	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">three	were	at	work	taking	the	sun’s	altitude	and	measuring	off	the	angle</p>
<p class="calibre1">made	by	the	luminary	with	the	horizon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	short	delay	ensued	from	our	clocks	being	fast	on	account	of	our	having</p>
<p class="calibre1">drifted	to	the	eastward	of	where	they	had	last	been	set. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	all	at	once	Mr	Fosset	sang	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	just	noon,	sir,	now.	The	sun’s	crossing	the	meridian!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	make	it	so,”	replied	the	skipper.	“Bos’un,	strike	eight	bells.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	 aye,	 sir,”	 came	 back	 from	 old	 Masters	 away	 forward,	 and	 then</p>
<p class="calibre1">followed	 the	 melodious	 chime	 of	 the	 ship’s	 bell	 that	 hung	 immediately</p>
<p class="calibre1">under	the	beak	of	the	fo’c’s’le.	“Ting-ting,	ting-ting,	ting-ting,	ting-ting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,”	 going	 into	 the	 wheel-house,	 “let	 us	 look	 at	 the	 chronometer	 and see	what	Greenwich	time	says,	and	then	tot	up	our	reckonings!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 two	 others	 followed	 him	 into	 the	 little	 room	 on	 the	 bridge,	 sitting down	to	a	table	in	which	the	track	chart	of	the	ship’s	course	lay,	and	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	busy	for	some	few	moments	calculating	and	working	out	our	latitude</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	longitude. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 was	 standing	 by	 the	 doorway	 after	 bringing	 up	 the	 correct	 time	 of	 the chronometers,	 which	 the	 skipper	 kept	 locked	 up	 in	 his	 own	 cabin	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">prevent	 their	 being	 meddled	 with,	 and	 I	 could	 see	 he	 looked	 puzzled, </p>
<p class="calibre1">adding	 up	 and	 subtracting	 his	 figures	 over	 and	 over	 again,	 as	 if	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought	 he	 must	 have	 made	 some	 error,	 though	 he	 found	 that	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">invariably	came	to	the	same	result. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 Fosset,”	 he	 cried	 at	 length,	 unable	 to	 restrain	 himself	 any	 longer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	make	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“39°	20	minutes	north	latitude	sir,	and	47°	15	minutes	west	longitude.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a>“Faith,	 an’	 I	 make	 it	 the	 same,	 sir,”	 also	 put	 in	 Garry	 O’Neil,	 the	 twain having	worked	out	the	reckoning	long	before	the	poor	skipper.	“Both	of	us</p>
<p class="calibre1">agree	to	the	virry	minnit,	sure,	lavin’	out	the	sicconds,	sir!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	George!”	exclaimed	the	skipper.	“It’s	even	worse	than	I	thought.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How,	sir?”	asked	Mr	Fosset	with	a	smile	on	his	face,	no	doubt	chuckling</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 himself	 at	 being	 cleverer	 and	 wiser	 than	 Captain	 Applegarth,	 who</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	not	believe	we	were	in	the	Gulf	Stream.	“Don’t	you	think	us	right, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	yes,	Fosset;	I	agree	with	you	myself.	The	 <i class="calibre4">reckoning</i>	is	right	enough, but	father’s	the	devil	to	pay!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	skipper	couldn’t	sacrifice	the	joke,	though	he	was	terribly	put	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See	 here,”	 he	 continued,	 “jabbing,”	 with	 great	 noise	 and	 force	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">compasses	with	which	he	was	measuring	off	our	position,	into	the	chart, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	if	that	was	in	fault,	while	Fosset	and	O’Neil	laughed.	“Look	where	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">are!	I	shouldn’t	have	thought	it	possible	for	us	to	have	been	driven	so	far</p>
<p class="calibre1">south,	right	into	the	Gulf	Stream,	as	we	are,	for	the	current	generally	runs</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	nor’-east’ards	below	the	Banks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	stream	has	done	it,	though,	sure	enough,”	said	Mr	Fosset;	“that	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	gale,	for	the	one	has	drifted	us	to	the	coast	and	the	other	pressed	us</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	southwards;	and	between	the	two	we’re	just	fetched	where	we	are, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sir!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,”	 replied	 the	 skipper,	 shrugging	 his	 shoulders,	 “you	 were	 right, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fosset,	and	I	was	wrong	this	morning.	Let	me	see,	though,	how	we	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">fetched	 here,	 if	 we	 can	 trace	 our	 course	 so	 far,	 from	 when	 we	 last	 took the	sun.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,	an’	that	was	Friday,	that	baste	of	a	day!”	interposed	Garry	O’Neil, </p>
<p class="calibre1">pointing	 to	 a	 place	 on	 the	 chart.	 “I	 worked	 at	 the	 rickonin’	 and	 I	 put	 it down	meself,	marking	it	with	a	red	pencil.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes;	 here	 it	 is,	 42°	 35	 minutes	 north	 latitude,	 and	 longitude	 50°	 10</p>
<p class="calibre1">minutes	 west,”	 said	 the	 skipper.	 “I	 worked	 it	 out	 also,	 on	 my	 own	 hook, and	you	and	I	tallied,	if	you	recollect?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a>“Of	course	we	did,	the	divvil	doubt	it,	sir,”	answered	the	second	mate	in his	usual	Irish	fashion.	“Thin,	sor,	we	ran	for	five	hours	from	that	p’int	on	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">west	by	south	course,	going	between	ten	and	twelve	knots;	for,	though	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t	say	it	meself,	Mister	Fosset	tould	me	the	wind	was	freshinin’	all	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">toime,	so	that	we	must	have	travelled	about	sixty	miles,	more	or	less.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	that	brings	us	to	this	blue	mark	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sor,	to	42°	28	minutes	north,	and	51°	12	minutes	west.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	we	sailed	right	before	the	wind,	due	south?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,	 an’	 we	 did	 that	 same	 afther	 Mister	 Haldane’s	 will-o’-the-wisp	 for three	hours,	bedad!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	Mr	O’Neil,”	I	pleaded,	“please	leave	me	out	of	it.	I’m	sure	I’ve	seen</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	heard	enough	of	the	ship	already!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be	 aisy,	 me	 darlint!	 It’s	 only	 me	 fun,	 sure;	 and	 I	 mean	 ye	 no	 harrum,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said	he	in	his	jocular	way.	“Arrah	how	can	I	lave	ye	out	of	the	story	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">ye’re	the	howl	h’id	and	tail	of	it,	sure,	and	without	ye	there’d	be	none	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">tile.	Yes,	cap’en,	dear,	sure,	an’	as	I	was	a-saying	when	Haldane	broke	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon	me	yarn,	thray	hours	on	this	southerly	course	brought	us	here	right</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	ye	see	me	little	finger,	now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About	 51°	 5	 minutes	 west	 longitude	 and	 41°	 40	 minutes	 north	 latitude. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	did	you	get	this,	eh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith,	sor,	the	ould	moon	looked	so	moighty	plisint	that	night	that	I	took	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">lunar	or	two,	jist	to	divart	mesilf	with,	when	Spokeshave	wint	below	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	was	nobody	lift	to	poke	fun	at,	sure!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	very	useful	sort	of	amusement,”	said	the	skipper	drily.	“And	I	see,	too, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you’ve	 put	 in	 the	 distance	 we’ve	 run,	 by	 dead	 reckoning,	 as	 about</p>
<p class="calibre1">another	fifty	miles	or	so?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sor.	The	bo’sun	hove	the	log	ivery	half	hour	till	the	engines	stopped, </p>
<p class="calibre1">an’	he	made	out	we	were	going	sixteen	knots	an’	more,	bedad,	so	he	s’id, </p>
<p class="calibre1">whin	we	were	running	before	the	wind	with	full	shtame	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a>“That	 was	 very	 likely,	 O’Neil,”	 replied	 the	 skipper,	 “but,	 after	 that,	 we altered	course	again,	you	know!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	course	we	did,	sor,	an’	you’ll	say	it	marked	roight	down	there	on	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">line!	 We	 thin	 sailed	 west,	 a	 quarter	 south	 by	 compass,	 close-hauled	 on the	starboard	track,	for	two	hours	longer	after	you	altered	course	ag’in	an’</p>
<p class="calibre1">bore	up	to	the	west’ard,	keeping	on	till	the	ingines	bhroke	down,	bad	cess</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	’em!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	was	that?”	asked	the	skipper	slowly.	“I	was	so	worried	and	flurried</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	the	moment	that	I	forgot	to	take	the	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Four	 bells	 in	 the	 first	 watch,	 sor,”	 replied	 the	 Irishman	 quickly.	 “It	 was after	 we’d	 brought	 up	 poor	 Jackson	 from	 below,	 as	 Stoddart,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">engineer,	faith,	was	a	sittin’	near,	jist	before	me,	attindin’	on	the	poor	chap</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	cabin,	whin	the	rush	of	shtame	came	flyin’	up	the	hatchway,	faith, </p>
<p class="calibre1">an’	the	sekrew	stopped.	We	both	of	us	looked	at	the	saloon	clock	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">instant,	sure,	an’	saw	the	toime,	sor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	is	the	last	mark	on	the	chart,	then?”	said	the	old	skipper	meaningly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">pencil	and	compass	in	hand,	and	still	bending	over	the	tell-tale	track	map</p>
<p class="calibre1">spread	 out	 on	 the	 wheel-house	 table.	 “Since	 that,	 nobody	 knows	 how</p>
<p class="calibre1">we’ve	drifted!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith,	 no	 one,	 sor,”	 returned	 Garry	 O’Neil,	 thinking	 the	 question	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">addressed	 to	 him.	 “Only,	 perhaps,	 the	 Pope,	 God	 bless	 him,	 or	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Imporor	of	Chainy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	laughed	at	this,	Captain	Applegarth	now	losing	his	preoccupied	air	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	there	were	nothing	to	be	gained,	he	thought,	by	dwelling	any	longer	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 wonderful,	 though,	 how	 we	  <i class="calibre4">had</i>	 drifted	 in	 the	 short	 interval, comparatively,	that	had	elapsed	since	we	became	disabled! </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Mr	Fosset	had	been	the	first	to	find	out	in	the	morning	the	Gulf	Stream</p>
<p class="calibre1">—that	 great	 river	 that	 runs	 a	 course	 of	 some	 two	 thousand	 miles	 in	 the middle	of	the	ocean,	keeping	itself	perfectly	distinct	from	the	surrounding</p>
<p class="calibre1">water	 through	 which	 it	 flows,	 from	 its	 inception	 as	 a	 current	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Caribbean	Sea	to	its	final	disposal	in	the	North	Atlantic—had	first	carried</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a>us	in	an	easterly	direction	after	we	had	broken-down	so	utterly;	while	the strong	 nor’-westerly	 gale,	 aided	 probably	 by	 the	 Arctic	 current,	 running due	south	from	the	Polar	regions	and	which	disputes	the	right	of	way	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Gulf	Stream	some	little	distance	to	the	southwards	of	the	great	Banks</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 Newfoundland,	 had	 pressed	 upon	 the	 helpless	 hull	 of	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Star	 of	 the</i> <i class="calibre4">North</i>,	bearing	her	away	whither	they	pleased. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	unable	to	resist	either	the	winds	or	the	waves,	these	combined	forces</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 driven	 her	 off	 her	 course	 at	 an	 oblique	 angle,	 thus	 converting	 the nor’-easterly,	or	easterly	drift	proper,	of	the	Gulf	Stream	into	a	true	sou’-</p>
<p class="calibre1">westerly	one,	taking	us	from	latitude	41°	30	minutes	north	and	longitude</p>
<p class="calibre1">51°	40	minutes	west,	where	we	were	on	the	previous	Friday	night,	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	were	forced	to	lie-to,	to	our	present	position	on	the	chart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	put	the	case	more	concisely,	the	 <i class="calibre4">Star	of	the	North</i>	had	been	carried	for the	distance	of	 <i class="calibre4">four	degrees	and	a	half</i>	exactly	of	longitude	backward	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	outward	track	to	New	York	and	some	 <i class="calibre4">two	degrees</i>	or	thereabouts	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 southwards,	 placing	 us	 as	 nearly	 as	 possible	 in	 the	 position	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">skipper	 had	 already	 indicated,	 a	 direction	 of	 some	 five	 hundred	 miles</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	 or	 less	 from	 our	 proper	 course	 and	 about	 midway	 between</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bermuda	and	the	Azores,	or	Western	Islands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	 Captain	 Applegarth	 was	 explaining	 this,	 as	 much	 for	 my	 benefit</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	instruction,	I	believe,	as	anything,	a	thought	occurred	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	we	not	now,	sir,	in	the	track	of	all	the	homeward-bound	ships	sailing</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	great	circle	from	the	West	Indies	and	South	American	ports?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	skipper	looked	at	me	steadily,	“smelling	a	rat”	at	once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 suppose,	 Haldane,”	 he	 said	 somewhat	 sternly,	 “you	 want	 to	 get	 me</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	to	that	infernal	ship	again?	Not	if	I	know	it,	my	lad.	As	you	told	Mr</p>
<p class="calibre1">O’Neil	just	now,	we’ve	all	had	enough	and	to	spare	of	that	vessel	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wild-goose	 chase	 she	 has	 led	 us	 from	 first	 to	 last.	 I	 won’t	 hear	 another word	about	her,	by	Jingo!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	then	old	Masters,	who	had	gone	up	in	the	foretop	to	set	something</p>
<p class="calibre1">right	which	had	struck	his	sailor	eye	as	not	being	altogether	as	it	should</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	aboard	the	 <i class="calibre4">Star	of	the	North</i>,	raised	his	arm	to	attract	the	attention	of those	on	deck	below	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a>“Hullo,	 there,	 bo’sun!”	 called	 out	 the	 skipper,	 seeing	 him,	 for	 he	 seldom kept	 his	 glasses	 away	 from	 the	 rigging	 of	 the	 ship	 and	 things	 aloft. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	the	row,	eh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	sees	summit	to	win’ard,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	George!”	exclaimed	the	skipper	in	a	tone	that	made	every	one	laugh</p>
<p class="calibre1">who	 heard,	 all	 but	 Masters;	 the	 coincidence	 was	 so	 comical	 after	 what</p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	 Applegarth	 had	 said	 only	 a	 minute	 before.	 “Not	 another	 ‘ghost-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ship,’	I	hope!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	sir,”	growled	the	boatswain	rather	savagely.	“It	bean’t	no	ghost-ship</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	time,	though	 <i class="calibre4">she</i>	ain’t	far	off,	I	knows,	to	my	thinkin’!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 added	 the	 last	 words	 as	 if	 speaking	 to	 himself,	 but	 I	 heard	 him,	 and his	remark	stopped	my	mirth	instanter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	it,	bo’sun,	that	you	 <i class="calibre4">do</i>	see,	then?”	cried	the	skipper	impatiently; </p>
<p class="calibre1">“that	 is,	 if	 you	 see	 anything	 at	 all	 beyond	 some	 vision	 of	 your	 own</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagination!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 ain’t	 dreaming,”	 hailed	 back	 old	 Masters,	 not	 quite	 catching	 what	 he said.	 “I	 sees	 summit	 as	 plain	 as	 possible	 out	 to	 win’ard.	 Aye,	 it	 be	 a-driftin’	down	athawt	our	hawser,	too,	cap’en.	Why,	hullo!	I’m	blessed.	Boat</p>
<p class="calibre1">ahoy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Thirteen. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">In	the	Nick	of	Time. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	 boat!”	 exclaimed	 Captain	 Applegarth,	 his	 jesting	 manner	 changing</p>
<p class="calibre1">instantly	to	one	of	earnest	attention.	“Where	away?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On	our	starboard	beam,	sir,”	sang	out	Masters	from	the	foretop.	“About</p>
<p class="calibre1">two	points	off,	I	fancies,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 can’t	 see	 her,”	 said	 the	 skipper,	 looking	 in	 the	 direction	 the	 boatswain had	indicated.	“I	thought	she	was	close-to	from	your	hailing	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>“She’s	further	away	now	than	I	thought,	sir!”	shouted	old	Masters	in	reply to	 this,	 after	 having	 another	 squirm	 over	 the	 topsail	 yard.	 “I’m	 blessed, though,	 if	 I	 ain’t	 lost	 her,	 with	 the	 ship’s	 head	 bobbing	 all	 round	 the compass.	No;	there	she	be	ag’in,	sir.	No—yes—yes.	There	she	is,	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	mile	or	so	off,	sir,	I’m	thinkin’.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	 George,	 Masters,	 you	 think	 too	 much,	 I	 think!”	 the	 skipper	 retorted angrily.	“You	don’t	seem	to	know	what	you’re	saying,	and	I	believe	you’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">gone	off	your	chump	since	you	saw	that	‘ghost-ship,’	as	you	called	it!	Go</p>
<p class="calibre1">aloft,	Haldane,	and	see	what	you	can	make	of	this	blessed	boat	he	says</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	sighted!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 was	 already	 in	 the	 weather	 shrouds	 before	 the	 skipper	 gave	 me	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1">order,	and	in	another	minute	I	was	on	the	top	beside	the	boatswain,	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">pointed	 out	 silently	 to	 me	 a	 little	 black	 speck	 in	 the	 distance	 apparently dancing	 about	 amid	 the	 waves,	 which	 were	 beginning	 to	 curl	 before	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">approaching	breeze	that	was	evidently	springing	up	from	the	westwards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fortunately,	 I	 had	 a	 pair	 of	 binoculars	 in	 my	 jacket	 pocket,	 and	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">immediately	levelled	the	glasses	at	the	object	in	view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	Haldane!”	at	last	sang	out	the	skipper	impatiently	from	the	end	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	bridge,	where	he	still	stood,	looking	up	at	me	with	his	chin	cocked	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	air.	“What	do	you	make	it	out	to	be,	eh,	my	lad?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 a	 boat	 sure	 enough,	 sir,”	 I	 shouted	 down	 to	 him,	 without	 taking	 my eyes	 off	 it.	 “She’s	 a	 long	 way	 off,	 though,	 sir,	 and	 I	 think	 she’s	 drifting further	away,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	deuce!”	exclaimed	Captain	Applegarth.	“Can	you	see	any	one	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">boat?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No—no—not	distinctly,	sir,”	I	replied	after	another	searching	look.	“Stay; </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 do—I	 do	 think	 there’s	 a	 figure	 at	 one	 end!	 and,	 yes—yes—I’m	 sure	 I noticed	something	that	appeared	like	a	movement,	but	it	might	have	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">caused	by	the	rocking	of	the	sea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	don’t	you	see	anybody,	or	can’t	you	make	anything	else	out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only	 the	 boat,	 sir,	 and	 that	 a	 breeze	 seems	 coming	 up	 from	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">westward.	 I	 see	 a	 white	 line	 on	 the	 water	 along	 the	 horizon.	 That’s	 all	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a>can	see,	sir!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 that’s	 not	 much	 use	 to	 us,”	 he	 growled	 below,	 beginning	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">customary	“quarter-deck	walk”	up	and	down	the	bridge.	“I	wish	some	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 come	 up	 from	 the	 engine-room	 to	 say	 they	 had	 repaired	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cylinder	and	that	we	could	go	ahead	again!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Almost	as	soon	as	he	spoke	thus	I	noticed	Mr	Stokes,	who	I	thought	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">lying	down	in	his	cabin,	coming	towards	the	forepart	of	the	ship	where	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">were,	from	the	direction	of	the	engine-room	hatchway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hullo,	 Stokes,”	 said	 the	 skipper,	 catching	 sight	 of	 him	 at	 once	 with	 his eagle	 eye	 that	 seemed	 to	 take	 in	 everything	 that	 went	 on,	 whether	 his back	 was	 turned	 or	 not.	 “I	 thought	 you	 were	 on	 the	 sick	 list	 still,	 and	 ill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	 oughtn’t	 to	 be	 bustling	 about	 so	 soon	 after	 your	 accident,	 my	 dear fellow!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	but	I	feel	better!”	replied	the	old	chief,	who,	although	he	was	still	pale</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 shaky,	 had	 a	 more	 cheerful	 look	 on	 his	 face	 than	 the	 day	 before, when	 he	 appeared	 decidedly	 ill.	 “I’ve	 been	 down	 below	 and	 I’m	 glad	 to say	 Stoddart	 and	 the	 other	 artificers,	 who	 I	 must	 say	 have	 worked	 well without	 me,	 you	 will	 be	 glad	 to	 know,	 have	 got	 the	 cylinder	 cover	 on again.	They’ve	made	a	splendid	job	of	it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stoddart	 himself	 is	 a	 splendid	 fellow,”	 said	 the	 skipper	 enthusiastically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	and	the	rest	of	your	staff,	too,	my	dear	Stokes.	By	George,	you’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">brought	us	good	news!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	that	isn’t	all,	cap’en,”	cried	the	old	fellow,	beaming	over	with	a	broad</p>
<p class="calibre1">smile	 of	 quiet	 enjoyment	 at	 the	 surprise	 the	 skipper	 showed.	 “They	 say below	 that	 they’ll	 be	 able	 to	 start	 the	 engines	 as	 soon	 as	 there’s	 a	 full head	 of	 steam	 on!	 Now	 what	 do	 you	 think	 of	 that,	 sir?	 Isn’t	 that	 good news?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 skipper	 looked	 ready	 to	 embrace	 our	 fat	 chief,	 and	 I	 believe	 only refrained	 from	 giving	 this	 expression	 of	 his	 joy	 by	 the	 sight	 of	 poor	 Mr Stokes’	bandaged	arm,	which	was	still	in	a	sling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 contented	 himself,	 therefore,	 with	 patting	 him	 tenderly	 on	 the	 back</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 walking	 round	 him	 admiringly,	 like	 a	 cat	 purring	 round	 a	 saucer	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a>cream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	 George!”	 he	 cried.	 “I	 feel	 as	 pleased	 as	 if	 my	 grandmother	 had	 left me	five	thousand	pounds!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wish	she	had,”	laughed	the	old	chief.	“I	would	ask	to	go	shares!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 so	 you	 should,	 my	 boy;	 so	 you	 should,”	 repeated	 the	 skipper	 with much	heartiness,	and	as	if	he	really	meant	it.	“How	soon	do	you	think	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">shall	be	able	to	start,	eh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very	 soon,	 I	 think,	 sir.	 The	 after-boiler	 fires	 were	 lit	 early	 this	 morning and	they’ve	been	getting	up	steam	ever	since.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	good!”	cried	the	skipper,	stopping	in	his	excited	walk	up	and	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	bridge,	which	he	had	again	resumed,	being	unable	to	keep	still,	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	looked	up,	caught	sight	of	me	and	hailed	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	say,	Haldane?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	 aye,	 sir?”	 I	 sang	 out	 from	 the	 top,	 where	 I	 had	 remained	 with	 the boatswain	 on	 the	 look-out,	 and	 hearing	 likewise	 all	 that	 transpired</p>
<p class="calibre1">beneath.	“What	do	you	want,	sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hope	you’re	keeping	your	eye	on	that	boat,	my	lad.	If	she	is	there	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">may	be	able	to	overhaul	her	yet,	if	you	don’t	lose	sight	of	her!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	 fear	 of	 that,	 sir,”	 I	 shouted	 back,	 pointing	 with	 my	 finger	 in	 the distance.	“There	she	is,	still	to	win’ard,	pretty	nearly	flush	with	the	water.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	she	really	is	there	all	right,	my	lad.	Keep	your	eye	on	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 funnels	 had	 been	 emitting	 smoke	 for	 some	 time	 without	 our	 having</p>
<p class="calibre1">paid	 much	 attention	 to	 the	 fact,	 the	 fires	 of	 the	 fore-boilers	 having	 been kept	 in	 and	 banked	 ever	 since	 our	 breakdown,	 in	 order	 to	 work	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pumps	and	capstan	gear	when	required;	but	now	steam,	I	noticed,	came</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	 as	 well	 as	 smoke,	 and	 I	 could	 hear	 it	 plainly	 roaring	 up	 the	 waste pipe,	besides	making	a	fearful	row. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Presently	another	sound	greeted	my	ears	and	made	me	jump. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>It	 was	 that	 of	 the	 electric	 bell	 in	 the	 wheel-house,	 giving	 warning	 that those	below	in	the	emporium	wished	to	make	some	communication. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr	Stokes	went	to	the	voice-tube	that	led	down	thither	from	the	bridge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	the	matter?”	he	roared	into	the	mouthpiece	so	loud	that	I	heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">every	word	he	uttered,	although	a-top	of	the	mast.	“Anything	wrong?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	couldn’t	of	course	catch	the	reply	that	came	up	the	pipe;	and	it	certainly</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 not	 a	 satisfactory	 one,	 for	 Mr	 Stokes	 turned	 round	 at	 once	 to	 the skipper,	who	immediately	stopped	his	quarter-deck	walk	to	hear	what	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">chief	had	to	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ve	 corrected	 the	 propeller,	 sir,”	 he	 exclaimed	 with	 a	 chuckle	 that made	his	fat	form	shake	all	over;	“and	Stoddart	says	he’s	only	waiting	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	signal	to	close	the	stop	valves	and	let	the	steam	into	the	cylinder.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	 George,	 he	 shan’t	 wait	 a	 minute	 longer!”	 cried	 Captain	 Applegarth, </p>
<p class="calibre1">moving	the	engine-room	telegraph.	“Go	ahead,	my	hearties,	as	soon	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	 please!	 Hullo,	 there,	 forrad,	 I	 want	 a	 hand	 here	 at	 the	 wheel.	 I suppose	the	steam	steering	gear	is	all	right	again	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 yes,	 sir,”	 replied	 Mr	 Stokes	 to	 this.	 “Grummet	 fixed	 that	 up	 on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sunday	afternoon,	he	told	me.	I	am	sure	it	was	done.	I	remember	he	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">doing	it	when	that	man-of-war	came	alongside	and	spoke	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Strange	I	didn’t	see	him	at	the	job;	he	must	have	been	pretty	smart	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">it!”	replied	the	skipper.	“But	I’m	very	glad	it	is	done,	though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	answer	to	the	skipper’s	signal	a	sudden	blast	of	steam	rushed	up	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">funnel	 abaft	 the	 wheel-house,	 and	 I	 could	 feel	 the	 ship	 tremble	 as	 the shaft	 began	 to	 revolve	 and	 the	 propeller	 blades	 splashed	 the	 water</p>
<p class="calibre1">astern	with	the	familiar	“thump-thump,	thump-thump.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	hands	joined	in	a	hearty	cheer,	to	which	Masters	and	I	in	the	top	lent</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	aid	our	lungs	could	give. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Steady	amidship,	there,”	sang	out	the	skipper	as	the	old	barquey	forged</p>
<p class="calibre1">ahead	once	more.	“Steady,	my	man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a>“Aye,	aye,	sir,”	answered	the	foremost	hand,	Parrell,	who	had	come	from the	 fo’c’s’le	 to	 take	 the	 first	 “trick”	 at	 the	 steering	 wheel	 on	 the	 bridge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Steady	it	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	does	the	boat	bear	now,	Haldane?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Two	points	off	our	starboard	bow,	sir,”	I	replied	to	this	hail	of	the	skipper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	about	three	miles	off,	I	think,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,”	he	shouted	back	to	me.	“Port	your	helm,	there!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	aye,	sir,”	repeated	Parrell.	“Port,	sir,	it	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	rising	her	fast	now,	sir,”	I	called	out	after	a	short	interval.	“There’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	man	in	the	boat;	yes,	a	man,	sir.	I	can	see	him	quite	plainly	now,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	sure	I’m	not	mistaken!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	quite	sure,	my	lad?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quite	sure,	sir.	And	he’s	alive,	too,	I’m	certain.	Yes,	sir;	he	moved	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">distinctly.	I	could	see	him	plainly.	Why,	the	boat	is	so	near	now	that	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">ought	to	see	it	from	the	deck.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	so	I	can,	by	Jingo,	Haldane!”	replied	the	captain,	peering	out	ahead</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself	with	a	telescope	from	the	end	of	the	bridge.	“I	fancy	I	can	see	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">second	figure,	and	it	looks	like	another	man,	too,	lying	down	in	the	bows</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 boat,	 as	 well	 as	 the	 figure	 at	 the	 stern,	 who	 seems	 to	 me	 to	 be holding	up	an	oar	or	something!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	there	is,	sir,”	I	called	out,	stopping	on	my	way	down	the	rigging	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 another	 look.	 After	 a	 pause	 I	 exclaimed,	 “I	 can	 see	 both	 of	 them, and	with	my	naked	eye.	I	can	see	them	now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 then,	 you’d	 better	 come	 down	 from	 aloft.	 Tell	 your	 friend,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">boatswain,	 to	 come	 down	 as	 well.	 He’ll	 be	 wanted	 at	 the	 fo’c’s’le	 when we	presently	come	up	to	the	boat,	as	I	trust	we	shall!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lucky	Masters	saw	the	boat,	sir,”	said	I	when	I	reached	the	deck	and	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 skipper’s	 side	 again.	 “But	 even	 more	 fortunate	 it	 is	 for	 the	 poor fellows	that	our	engines	are	working	again,	sir,	for	otherwise	we	could	not</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a>have	been	able	to	get	up	to	the	boat	and	save	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 isn’t	 luck,	 my	 boy,”	 observed	 Mr	 Stokes,	 whom	 the	 death	 of	 poor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jackson	 and	 his	 own	 narrow	 escape	 from	 a	 like	 fate	 had	 led	 to	 think	 of other	matters	besides	those	connected	with	his	mundane	profession.	“It’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">Providence!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Fourteen. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">An	Appeal	For	Aid. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	that’s	the	better	way	of	looking	at	it,”	chimed	in	the	skipper,	raising</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	arm	at	the	same	time	from	his	station	at	the	end	of	the	bridge,	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 was	 conning	 the	 ship.	 He	 then	 called	 out	 sharply,	 to	 enforce	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">signal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Luff	up,	you	lubber,	luff!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Luff	it	is,	sir,”	rejoined	the	helmsman,	rapidly	turning	round	the	spokes	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	little	steam	steering	wheel.	“It’s	hard	over	now,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Steady	there,”	next	sang	out	the	captain.	“Steady,	my	man!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	 aye,	 sir,”	 repeated	 the	 parrot-like	 Tom	 Parrell,	 bringing	 the	 helm amidships	again.	“Steady	it	is!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	George,	we’re	nearing	the	boat	fast!”	cried	the	skipper	after	another</p>
<p class="calibre1">short	 pause,	 during	 which	 we	 had	 been	 going	 ahead	 full	 speed,	 with	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">quick	 “thump-thump,	 thump-thump”	 of	 the	 propeller	 and	 the	 water</p>
<p class="calibre1">foaming	past	our	bows.	“Starboard,	Parrell!	Starboard	a	bit	now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	 aye,	 sir,”	 came	 again	 the	 helmsman’s	 answering	 cry	 from	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wheel-house.	“Starboard	it	is,	sir!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Keep	her	so.	A	trifle	more	off.	Steady!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Steady	it	is,	sir!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	 down	 with	 it,	 Parrell!”	 sang	 out	 the	 skipper,	 bringing	 his	 hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">instanter	 on	 the	 handle	 of	 the	 engine-room	 gong,	 which	 he	 sounded</p>
<p class="calibre1">twice,	 directing	 those	 in	 charge	 below	 to	 reduce	 speed,	 while	 he	 hailed old	 Masters	 on	 the	 fo’c’s’le.	 “Hi,	 bo’sun!	 Look-out	 there	 forrad	 with	 your rope’s	end	to	heave	to	the	poor	fellows!	We’re	just	coming	alongside	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">boat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a>“Aye,	aye,	sir!”	replied	Masters	promptly,	keeping	one	eye	on	the	skipper on	 the	 bridge	 and	 the	 other	 directed	 to	 the	 little	 craft	 we	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">approaching,	and	now	close	to	our	port	bow.	“We’re	all	ready	forrad,	sir. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mind	you	don’t	run	her	down,	sir.	She’s	nearly	under	our	forefoot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	bo’sun,”	returned	the	skipper.	“Port,	Parrell!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Port	it	is,	sir,”	repeated	Tom	Parrell.	“Two	points	off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Steady,	man,	steady,”	continued	the	skipper,	holding	his	hand	up	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Boat	ahoy!	Stand	by.	We’re	going	to	throw	you	a	rope!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 the	 same	 instant	 Captain	 Applegarth	 sounded	 the	 engine-room	 gong</p>
<p class="calibre1">again,	bringing	the	 <i class="calibre4">Star	of	the	North</i>	to	a	dead	stop	as	we	steamed	up	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 boat	 slanting-wise,	 the	 steamer	 having	 just	 sufficient	 way	 on	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	the	screw	shaft	ceased	revolving,	to	glide	gently	up	to	the	very	spot</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	the	little	floating	waif	was	gently	bobbing	up	and	down	on	the	wave</p>
<p class="calibre1">right	ahead	of	us,	and	barely	half	a	dozen	yards	away,	drifting,	at	the	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 wind,	 without	 any	 guidance	 from	 its	 occupants,	 who	 seemingly</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	unaware	of	our	approach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Boat	ahoy!”	shouted	the	skipper	once	more,	raising	his	voice	to	a	louder</p>
<p class="calibre1">key.	“Look-out,	there!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	men	in	the	bows	of	the	boat	still	remained	in	the	same	attitude,	as	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">unconscious	or	dead;	but	the	other	in	the	stern-sheets	appeared	to	hear</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	skipper’s	hail,	for	he	half-turned	his	head	and	uttered	a	feeble	sort	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">noise	and	made	a	feeble	motion	with	one	of	his	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now’s	 your	 time,	 bo’sun!”	 cried	 Captain	 Applegarth.	 “Heave	 that	 line, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sharp!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	 aye,	 sir,”	 roared	 out	 Masters	 in	 his	 gruff	 tones.	 “Stand	 by,	 below there!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	that	the	coil	of	half-inch	rope	which	he	held	looped	on	his	arm	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	circling	whirl	through	the	air,	the	end	falling	right	across	the	gunwales	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 boat,	 close	 to	 the	 after	 thwart,	 where	 sat	 the	 second	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">castaways,	who	eagerly	stretched	out	his	hand	to	clutch	at	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a>But,	 unfortunately,	 he	 failed	 to	 grasp	 it,	 and	 the	 exertion	 evidently	 being too	much	for	him,	for	he	tumbled	forward	on	his	face	at	the	bottom	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">boat,	 while	 the	 rope	 slipped	 over	 the	 side	 into	 the	 water,	 coming	 back home	 to	 us	 alongside	 the	 old	 barquey	 on	 the	 next	 send	 of	 the	 sea,	 the heavy	roll	of	our	ship	when	she	brought	up	broadside-on,	as	well	as	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">weight	of	the	line	saturated	with	water,	fetching	it	in	to	us	all	the	sooner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Poor	 fellows;	 they	 can’t	 help	 themselves!”	 cried	 the	 skipper,	 who	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">watched	 the	 boatswain’s	 throw	 and	 its	 unsatisfactory	 result	 with	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">deepest	interest.	“Bear	a	hand	there,	some	one	forrad,	and	have	another</p>
<p class="calibre1">try	to	reach	them.	The	boat’s	drifting	past,	and	we’ll	have	to	go	astern	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">board	her	in	another	minute,	if	you	don’t	look	sharp!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having	climbed	into	the	fore-rigging,	however,	so	as	to	have	a	good	look</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	the	boat	and	its	occupants	as	we	neared	them,	I	was	quite	as	quick	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 skipper	 to	 notice	 what	 had	 happened,	 having,	 indeed,	 foreseen	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">contingency	before	it	occurred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	ere	Masters	or	any	of	the	other	men	could	stir	a	hand,	having	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	my	mind	what	to	do,	I	had	seized	hold	of	part	of	the	slack	of	the	line</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 remained	 inboard	 and,	 plunging	 into	 the	 sea,	 swam	 towards	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">boat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 couple	 of	 strokes,	 combined	 with	 the	 forward	 impetus	 of	 my	 leap</p>
<p class="calibre1">overboard,	took	me	up	to	the	little	craft,	and	in	a	jiffey	I	had	grasped	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">gunwale	aft	and	clambered	within	her,	securing	the	end	of	the	line	I	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">round	one	of	the	thwarts	at	once,	amid	the	ringing	cheers	of	the	skipper</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 my	 shipmates	 in	 the	 old	 barquey,	 who	 proceeded	 to	 haul	 us	 up</p>
<p class="calibre1">alongside	without	further	delay,	tugging	away	at	the	tar	rope	I	had	hitched</p>
<p class="calibre1">on,	 yo-heave-hoing	 and	 hurrahing	 in	 one	 and	 the	 same	 breath	 right</p>
<p class="calibre1">lustily! </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	smart	were	they,	so	instantaneous	had	been	the	action	of	the	moment</p>
<p class="calibre1">during	the	episode,	that	we	were	close	in	to	the	ship’s	side	and	under	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">conning,	immediately	below	the	port	end	of	the	bridge,	where	the	skipper</p>
<p class="calibre1">stood	 leaning	 over	 the	 rail	 and	 surveying	 operations,	 before	 I	 had	 time actually	to	look	round	so	as	to	have	a	nearer	view	of	the	unfortunate	men</p>
<p class="calibre1">whom	we	had	so	providentially	rescued. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>When	I	did	though,	one	glance	was	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	horror	stricken	at	the	sight	that	met	my	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 man	 whom	 I	 had	 observed	 when	 we	 were	 yet	 some	 distance	 off	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	lying	huddled	up	in	the	bows	motionless,	as	if	dying	or	already	dead,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	saw	had	received	a	horrible	wound	on	the	top	of	his	head	that	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	nearly	smashed	in	the	skull,	besides	almost	severing	one	of	his	ears</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	 was	 hanging	 from	 the	 cheek	 bone,	 attached	 by	 a	 mere	 scrap	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">skin,	the	bottom	boards	of	the	boat	near	him	being	stained	with	blood	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	flowed	from	the	cut,	and	his	hair	likewise	matted	together	with	gore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh,	it	was	horrible	to	see!	He	was	not	dead,	however,	as	I	had	thought, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 only	 in	 a	 state	 of	 stupor,	 breathing	 heavily	 and	 making	 a	 strange stertorous	sound	as	if	snoring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 fellow-sufferer	 aft,	 who	 did	 not	 appear	 to	 have	 suffered	 so	 much	 as his	 comrade,	 had	 seemingly	 swooned	 from	 exhaustion	 or	 exposure;	 as, </p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 my	 putting	 my	 arm	 round	 him	 and	 lifting	 up	 his	 bent	 head,	 the	 man opened	his	eyes	and	murmured	something	faintly	in	some	foreign	lingo—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spanish,	I	think	it	was;	at	any	rate	a	language	I	did	not	understand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	was	unable	to	notice	anything	beyond	these	details,	which	I	grasped</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 that	 one	 hurried	 glance;	 for	 as	 I	 was	 in	 the	 act	 of	 raising	 up	 the	 poor chap	in	the	stern-sheets,	the	skipper	hailed	me	from	the	bridge	above. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Below	 there!”	 he	 sang	 out.	 “How	 are	 the	 poor	 fellows?	 Are	 they	 alive, Haldane?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	are	in	a	bad	way,	sir,”	I	replied.	“They’ve	got	the	life	left	in	them	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">that’s	all,	I’m	afraid!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Neither	dead,	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bravo!	 ‘whilst	 there’s	 life	 there’s	 hope,’”	 cried	 the	 skipper	 in	 a	 cheery tone.	 “Are	 they	 quite	 helpless,	 do	 you	 think,	 Haldane—I	 mean	 quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">unable	to	climb	up	the	side?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quite	unable,	sir,”	I	answered.	“One’s	unconscious,	and	I	don’t	think	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>other	could	move	an	inch	if	he	tried!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	we	must	haul	’em	up,”	said	Captain	Applegarth,	turning	to	Masters, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who	had	popped	his	head	over	the	bulwarks	and	was	now	looking	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	the	boat,	like	the	rest	of	the	hands	on	board.	“I	say,	bo’sun,	can’t	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">rig	up	a	chair	or	something	that	we	can	lower	down	for	the	poor	fellows?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	 aye,	 sir,”	 responded	 old	 Masters,	 drawing	 in	 his	 head	 from	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bulwarks	 and	 disappearing	 from	 my	 view	 as	 I	 looked	 upwards	 from	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">stern-sheets,	where	I	was	still	holding	up	the	slowly-recovering	man.	“I’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">rig	up	a	whip	from	the	foreyard	and	we	can	let	down	a	hammock	for	’em, </p>
<p class="calibre1">tricing	up	one	at	a	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stay,	 cap’en,”	 cried	 Mr	 Fosset	 as	 the	 boatswain	 went	 bustling	 off,	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">suppose,	though	of	course	from	my	position	I	could	not	see	him,	to	carry</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	this	plan	of	his.	“The	davits	here	amidship	are	all	right,	as	well	as	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tackle	of	our	cutter	that	had	got	washed	away	in	the	gale.	Wouldn’t	it	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">easier	to	let	down	the	falls,	sir,	and	run	up	the	boat	all	standing	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">poor	fellows	in	her	as	they	are?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	George,	the	very	thing,	Fosset!”	exclaimed	the	skipper,	accepting	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">suggestion	with	alacrity.	“It	will	save	the	poor	fellows	a	lot	of	jolting,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 all	 the	 easier	 for	 us,	 as	 you	 say.	 Besides,	 the	 little	 craft	 will	 come	 in handy	for	us,	as	we’re	rather	short	of	boats	just	now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Short	of	boats,	sir!”	repeated	the	first	mate	ironically	as	he	set	to	work	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">once,	 with	 the	 help	 of	 a	 couple	 of	 the	 hands	 who	 jumped	 to	 his	 side	 to assist	him	the	moment	he	spoke,	casting	off	the	lashings	of	the	davits	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	to	rig	them	outwards,	letting	go	at	the	same	time	the	hooks	of	the	fall</p>
<p class="calibre1">blocks	and	overhauling	the	running	gear.	“Why,	sir,	we	haven’t	even	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dinghy	 left	 intact	 after	 that	 clean	 sweep	 we	 had	 from	 the	 wave	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">pooped	us!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	aye,	I	know	that	well	enough,”	said	the	skipper	drily.	“But,	look	alive</p>
<p class="calibre1">now,	Fosset,	with	that	tackle,	and	don’t	be	a	month	of	Sundays	over	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">job!	 Send	 down	 two	 of	 the	 cutter’s	 crew	 to	 overrun	 the	 falls	 and	 drop down	into	the	boat.	They	can	help	Haldane	in	holding	up	that	poor	chap</p>
<p class="calibre1">astern	and	also	bear	a	hand	in	hoisting	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	sir;	we’re	just	ready,”	shouted	back	the	first	mate	as	he	gave	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a>word	to	let	go.	“Lower	away	there	with	the	slack	of	those	falls.	Easy,	my man,	gently	does	it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 another	 instant	 down	 came	 the	 fall	 blocks,	 with	 one	 of	 the	 hands</p>
<p class="calibre1">hanging	 on	 to	 each,	 the	 men	 alighting	 “gingerly”	 on	 the	 thwarts	 of	 the boat	 in	 the	 bow	 and	 stern	 of	 the	 little	 craft,	 which	 became	 immersed</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost	up	to	the	gunwales	with	the	additional	weight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 was	 only	 for	 a	 moment,	 for	 the	 next	 minute	 Mr	 Fosset	 gave	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">signal	 to	 “hoist	 away,”	 the	 falls	 having	 been	 hooked	 on	 beneath	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">thwarts	in	a	jiffey,	and	up	we	all	went	in	mid	air,	“between	the	devil	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	deep	sea,”	as	we	say	afloat	sometimes! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bravo!”	cried	the	skipper	when	we	reached	the	level	of	the	gangway	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	all	able	to	step	out	on	to	the	deck.	“That’s	very	handsomely	done, </p>
<p class="calibre1">my	lads!	Now	let	us	see	about	lifting	the	poor	fellows	out.	That	chap	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 bows	 seems	 in	 a	 very	 bad	 way!	 You’d	 better	 carry	 him	 into	 the cuddy	at	once	and	let	Mr	O’Neil	look	after	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Indade,	I	will,	sor,”	said	our	doctor-mate,	who	was	standing	near	by	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	spirit	flask	in	one	hand	and	a	medicine	glass	in	the	other,	ready	to	give</p>
<p class="calibre1">immediate	succour	to	the	rescued	men.	“Carry	the	poor	beggar	along	an’</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ll	be	afther	ye	in	a	minnit;	for	this	other	misfortunate	gossoon	here	looks</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	if	he	wouldn’t	be	the	worst	for	a	dhrop	of	good	brandy,	an’	faith,	I’ll	say</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	him	fourst,	avic!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	saying	the	Irishman	poured	some	of	the	contents	of	the	spirit	flask	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 glass,	 which	 he	 held	 to	 the	 lips	 of	 the	 man.	 Mr	 Fosset	 and	 I	 were supporting	him	in	our	arms	against	the	side	of	the	boat,	whence	we	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	removed	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 poor	 fellow’s	 strength	 returned	 to	 him	 almost	 as	 soon	 as	 he	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">sipped	a	drop	or	two	of	the	brandy,	and,	starting	away	from	the	first	mate</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	myself,	as	if	no	longer	needing	our	aid,	he	stood	erect	on	the	deck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Mil	 gracias,	 amigos</i>,”	 he	 said,	 with	 a	 polite	 inclination	 of	 his	 head,	 in apology	like	for	shaking	himself	free	from	us.	“<i class="calibre4">Estoy	major</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Applegarth	stepped	up	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a>“I	 am	 sorry	 I	 can’t	 speak	 Spanish,	 sir,	 though	 I	 understand	 you	 to	 say you’re	 better.	 We’re	 Englishmen	 all	 on	 board	 this	 ship,	 sir,	 and	 I’m	 glad we’ve	been	able	to	pick	you	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 eyes	 of	 the	 man	 glistened	 and	 a	 pleased	 expression	 stole	 over	 his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What!	 You	 are	 English!	 he	 exclaimed	 excitedly.	 But—but	 I’m	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">American!	Only	I’ve	been	so	long	in	Venezuela	amongst	Spaniards	that	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">sometimes	forget	my	own	language.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	skipper	was	equally	delighted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	George!”	he	said.	“I	was	sure	you	were	no	blessed	foreigner,	in	spite</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	your	lingo,	sir!	Welcome	on	board	 <i class="calibre4">the	Star	of	the	North</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 stranger	 looked	 round	 and	 his	 manner	 changed	 at	 once,	 and	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">pointed	towards	our	funnels	anxiously	and	their	escaping	steam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	steam	vessel,	eh!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 sir,”	 said	 the	 skipper.	 “I	 command	 her,	 sir.	 Cap’en	 Applegarth,	 at your	service!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	deuce!	I	was	forgetting.	We	passed	you	last	night,	I	remember	now! </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	you’re	the	captain?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye!”	replied	the	skipper,	not	quite	making	out	what	the	other	was	driving</p>
<p class="calibre1">at.	“I’m	captain	of	this	ship!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Merciful	 Heavens!”	 cried	 the	 rescued	 man,	 falling	 on	 his	 knees	 on	 the deck	and	bursting	into	a	passion	of	sobs.	“Thanks	be	to	God!	Yes,	thanks</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	to	God!	You	will	save	her,	captain.	You	will	save	her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 skipper	 thought	 the	 evident	 suffering	 he	 had	 gone	 through	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned	his	brain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Save	 who?”	 he	 asked,	 adding	 in	 a	 kinder	 tone:	 “Of	 course,	 we’ll	 do</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything	 and	 everything	 we	 can	 for	 you,	 but	 I	 must	 know	 my	 bearings</p>
<p class="calibre1">first,	my	friend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a>The	man	was	on	his	feet	at	once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 am	 not	 mad,	 captain,	 as	 you	 appear	 to	 think.	 I	 can	 see	 from	 your manner	 you	 think	 so,”	 he	 said.	 “I	 want	 you	 to	 save	 my	 Elsie,	 my	 only child,	 my	 little	 daughter,	 whom	 those	 villains,	 those	 black	 devils,	 are carrying	off!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	 only	 child,	 your	 daughter—black	 devils,”	 echoed	 Captain</p>
<p class="calibre1">Applegarth,	 astonished	 at	 the	 poor	 man’s	 speech	 and	 at	 his	 wild	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">agonised	look.	“What	do	you	mean,	sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Heavens!	 We’re	 losing	 time	 while	 those	 scoundrels	 are	 getting	 away</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	ship!”	exclaimed	the	other	frantically	and	walking	to	and	fro	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">most	excited	state.	“Fire	up	the	engines,	pile	on	the	coals	and	steam	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 devil!	 and	 go	 in	 chase	 of	 her,	 my	 good	 captain,	 you	 will?	 For</p>
<p class="calibre1">Heaven’s	 sake,	 captain,	 for	 the	 love	 of	 God,	 start	 at	 once	 in	 chase	 of her!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	 chase	 of	 whom?”	 asked	 Captain	 Applegarth,	 still	 believing	 him	 to	 be out	of	his	mind.	“In	chase	of	whom?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 man	 uttered	 a	 heart-rending	 cry,	 in	 which	 anger,	 grief	 and	 piteous appeal	were	alike	blended. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	chase	of	a	band	of	black	miscreants	who	have	committed	murder	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">piracy	on	the	high	seas!”	he	ejaculated	in	broken	accents.	“The	blood	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">number	 of	 white	 men	 massacred	 by	 treacherous	 negroes	 calls	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1">vengeance,	the	safety	of	a	young	girl	and	the	lives	of	your	brother	sailors</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	on	board	the	ship	calls	to	you	for	help	and	rescue!	Great	Heaven!	Will</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	stand	idly	by	and	not	render	the	aid	you	can?	Think,	captain,	a	little</p>
<p class="calibre1">girl	like	your	own	daughter—my	Elsie,	my	little	one!	Yes,	and	white	men, </p>
<p class="calibre1">your	brothers,	and	sailors,	too,	like	yourselves,	at	the	mercy	of	a	gang	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">black	ruffians!	Sir,	will	you	help	them	or	not?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Fifteen. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">We	start	in	Chase	of	the	Ship. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a>The	effect	of	this	appeal	was	electrical,	not	only	on	the	skipper,	but	on	all of	us	standing	by. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great	 heavens,	 man!”	 cried	 the	 captain,	 staring	 at	 the	 other	 in	 wild</p>
<p class="calibre1">astonishment.	 “What	 do	 you	 mean?	 I	 cannot	 understand	 you,	 sir.	 Your</p>
<p class="calibre1">ship,	you	say—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	words	are	plain	enough,	captain,”	said	the	stranger,	interrupting	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">skipper.	 “Our	 ship,	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Saint	 Pierre</i>,	 is	 in	 the	 possession	 of	 a	 gang	 of Haytian	 negroes	 who	 rose	 on	 us	 while	 we	 were	 on	 the	 high	 seas	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">murdered	 most	 of	 the	 officers	 and	 the	 crew.	 They	 then	 threw	 poor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	 Alphonse,	 who	 commanded	 her,	 overboard,	 after	 they	 had	 half</p>
<p class="calibre1">killed	 him,	 and	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 unfortunate	 sailors	 and	 passengers, </p>
<p class="calibre1">amongst	 them	 my	 little	 daughter,	 are	 now	 at	 the	 mercy	 of	 the	 black</p>
<p class="calibre1">devils!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	 God!”	 exclaimed	 the	 skipper,	 confounded	 by	 this	 lucid	 statement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you,	sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	an	American!”	said	the	other	with	a	proud	air,	drawing	himself	up	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	full	height	of	six	feet	and	more	and	with	his	eyes	flashing,	while	a	red</p>
<p class="calibre1">flush	mounted	to	his	cheeks,	which	had	formerly	been	deadly	pale.	“I’m	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">white	man,	captain,	and	it’s	not	likely	I	would	stand	by	and	see	people	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 own	 colour	 butchered!	 Of	 course,	 sir,	 I	 went	 to	 the	 poor	 captain’s assistance,	 but	 then	 the	 murderers	 served	 me	 almost	 as	 badly	 as	 they</p>
<p class="calibre1">did	him,	chucking	me	overboard	after	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	beg	your	pardon,	sir,	I’m	sure,	for	appearing	to	doubt	your	story,”	cried</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	skipper,	stretching	forward	his	hand,	which	the	other	eagerly	grasped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	fact	is,	sir,	I	thought	at	first	your	sufferings	had	set	your	head	wrong; </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	now	I	need	hardly	say	I	believe	thoroughly	every	word	you’ve	told	us, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	you	may	rely	on	my	aid	and	that	of	every	man	aboard	here	to	help</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	 and	 yours.	 There’s	 my	 hand	 on	 it,	 sir,	 and	 my	 word	 you’ll	 find	 as good	as	my	bond,	so	sure	as	my	name	is	Jack	Applegarth!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 mine,	 captain,	 is	 Vereker,	 Colonel	 Vereker,	 at	 your	 service,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">returned	the	other,	reciprocating	the	skipper’s	cordiality	as	he	looked	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">straight	in	the	face,	holding	his	hand	the	while	in	a	firm	grip.	He	let	go	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">skipper’s	fist,	however,	the	next	moment	and	a	puzzled	expression	came</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a>into	 his	 eyes	 as	 he	 glanced	 round	 occasionally,	 apparently	 in	 search	 of some	one	or	other.	“Heavens!	Where’s	my	unfortunate	comrade	who	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	boat	with	me—poor	Captain	Alphonse?	Alas,	I	had	forgotten	him!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 have	 not	 forgotten	 him,	 though,	 colonel,”	 said	 the	 skipper	 smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	 has	 been	 carried	 below	 to	 the	 saloon	 on	 the	 maindeck,	 where	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">second	mate,	Mr	O’Neil,	who	is	a	qualified	surgeon,	is	now	attending	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	injuries.	He	has	been	terribly	mauled,	poor	fellow;	we	could	see	that!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	terribly!”	repeated	the	other	with	a	shudder,	as	if	the	recollection	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	he	and	his	fellow-sufferers	had	gone	through	suddenly	came	back	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	 at	 the	 moment.	 “But,	 great	 Heavens!	 captain,	 we’re	 losing	 time	 and that	 accursed	 ship	 with	 those	 scoundrels	 and	 our	 remaining	 comrades, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	with	my	darling	child	on	board,	is	speeding	away	while	we’re	talking</p>
<p class="calibre1">here.	 You	 will,	 will	 you	 not,	 Señor	 Applegarth,	 go	 in	 pursuit	 of	 her,	 my friend?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	George	I	will,	colonel;	I	will	at	once—immediately—if	you’ll	tell	me	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">bearings,”	 cried	 the	 skipper	 excitedly.	 “When	 was	 it	 this	 terrible	 affair happened?	When	did	you	leave	the	ship,	and	where?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	revolt	of	the	blacks,	or	mutiny,	I	should	call	it,	captain,	broke	out	four</p>
<p class="calibre1">days	 ago,	 on	 last	 Friday,	 indeed,	 sir,”	 said	 the	 American	 promptly	 in	 his deep	musical	voice,	and	whose	foreign	accent	obliterated	all	trace	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">unmelodious	 Yankee	 twang.	 “But	 we	 kept	 the	 rascals	 at	 bay	 until	 last</p>
<p class="calibre1">night,	 soon	 after	 sundown,	 when	 they	 made	 an	 ugly	 rush	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">overpowered	 us.	 Captain	 Alphonse	 had	 just	 sighted	 your	 vessel	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">distance	 and	 was	 burning	 a	 blue	 light	 over	 the	 stern	 to	 attract	 your</p>
<p class="calibre1">attention,	so	as	to	get	assistance	at	the	time	this	happened.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Was	yours	a	large,	full-rigged	ship?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,	the	 <i class="calibre4">Saint	Pierre</i>	is	of	good	size	and	had	all	her	sails	set,”	replied the	 other	 to	 the	 skipper’s	 question.	 “We	 were	 running	 before	 the	 wind</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	our	helm	lashed	amidship,	as	it	had	been	since	the	previous	Friday, </p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 we	 were	 all	 too	 busy	 defending	 our	 lives	 to	 think	 of	 attending	 to	 the ship.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Steering	about	nor’-east,	I	suppose?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a>“Confound	it,	captain!”	said	the	colonel	impatiently.	“We	were	drifting,	I	tell you,	 sir,	 at	 the	 mercy	 of	 the	 elements,	 and	 heaven	 only	 knows	 how	 we were	 going!	 Fortunately,	 the	 weather	 was	 pretty	 fair,	 save	 the	 very	 day the	 mutiny	 broke	 out,	 when	 it	 blew	 heavily	 and	 our	 canvas	 got	 split	 to pieces	as	there	was	no	one	to	go	aloft	and	take	it	in.	Otherwise	we	must</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	gone	to	the	bottom!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	 George!”	 exclaimed	 the	 skipper,	 turning	 round	 to	 old	 Masters	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself,	 who	 were	 still	 standing	 by	 with	 the	 hands	 who	 had	 come	 aft	 to haul	up	the	boat.	“Then	my	bo’sun	here,	and	this	young	officer	were	right</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	they	declared	they	saw	a	large	full-rigged	ship	to	the	westward	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">us,	though	I	only	noticed	the	light	of	your	flare-up.	You	were	too	far	off	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	to	make	you	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Ojala</i>!”	 ejaculated	 the	 American,	 reverting	 again	 to	 the	 familiar	 Spanish tongue	in	his	emotion.	“Would	to	God,	captain,	you	 <i class="calibre4">had</i>	seen	us!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 would	 have	 been	 useless	 if	 I	 had,	 my	 friend,”	 said	 the	 skipper</p>
<p class="calibre1">soothingly.	“We	couldn’t	move	to	come	to	your	assistance	if	every	soul	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">board	 had	 seen	 you	 and	 known	 your	 peril,	 sir;	 for	 our	 engines	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">broken-down	and	we	were	not	able	to	get	up	steam	again	until	late	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">afternoon,	when	we	ran	down	to	pick	you	up!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,	 sir,”	 hastily	 whispered	 the	 colonel,	 suppressing	 a	 sob	 of	 emotion, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“you	can	and	will	steam	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	 ask?”	 replied	 the	 skipper.	 “The	 moment	 we	 know	 where	 to	 go	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">search	of	your	ship,	that	very	moment	we’ll	start	and	try	to	overhaul	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	say	you	quitted	her	last	night?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quitted	her?	We	were	 <i class="calibre4">thrown</i>	overboard,	sir,	by	the	black	devils!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Applegarth	in	reply	said	calmly,	“Yes,	yes,	of	course,”	accepting</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	correction	and	trying	by	his	manner	to	soothe	the	infuriated	man.	“But</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	time	was	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 can’t	 say	 the	 exact	 hour,”	 replied	 the	 American,	 whose	 vexed	 tone</p>
<p class="calibre1">showed	 that	 the	 captain’s	 methodical	 mode	 of	 setting	 to	 work	 did	 not</p>
<p class="calibre1">quite	harmonise	with	the	excited	state	of	his	feelings.	“I	think,	however,	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">must	have	been	nearly	seven	o’clock,	as	well,	sir,	as	I	can	remember.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a>Then	 I	 chimed	 in.	 “Ah!”	 I	 exclaimed	 quickly,	 “that	 was	 just	 the	  <i class="calibre4">very	 time</i> that	 Masters	 and	 I	 heard	 the	 shooting	 in	 the	 distance	 to	 win’ard,	 and	 it was	six	bells	in	the	second	dog	watch!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	 it	 were,	 Master	 Haldane;	 so	 it	 were,”	 agreed	 the	 old	 boatswain, </p>
<p class="calibre1">looking	 from	 me	 to	 the	 skipper	 and	 then	 at	 Colonel	 Vereker.	 “Well,	 I’m blowed!	and	I’m	glad,	then,	for	that	there	ghost-ship	wor	a	rael	ship	arter</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	said	and	done.	Now	who	was	right,	I’d	like	to	know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	it	was	a	real	ship,	you	old	dotard!”	said	the	skipper	gruffly	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking	 angrily	 at	 him.	 “Of	 course	 it	 was,”	 he	 added,	 while	 our	 new</p>
<p class="calibre1">acquaintance	looked	 at	 us,	 unable,	 naturally,	 to	 understand	 the	 mystical</p>
<p class="calibre1">allusion;	 but	 Captain	 Applegarth	 soon	 turned	 his	 roving	 thoughts	 into</p>
<p class="calibre1">another	 direction	 by	 asking	 him	 a	 second	 question.	 “How	 long	 did	 you</p>
<p class="calibre1">keep	in	sight	of	your	vessel	after	leaving	her,	colonel,	do	you	think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	was	in	full	view	of	us	at	sunrise	this	morning,”	replied	the	American. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 boat	 in	 which	 we	 were	 adrift	 kept	 near	 her	 all	 night	 as	 there	 was very	little	wind,	if	any.	A	slight	breeze	sprang	up	shortly	after	the	sun	rose</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	she	then	steadily	increased	her	distance	from	us	as	the	day	wore	on, </p>
<p class="calibre1">finally	 disappearing	 from	 my	 gaze	 about	 noon,	 and	 taking	 with	 her	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	darling,	my	pet,	my	Elsie.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 poor	 fellow	 broke	 down	 again	 at	 this	 point	 throwing	 up	 his	 hands</p>
<p class="calibre1">passionately	 and	 burying	 his	 face	 in	 them,	 his	 whole	 frame	 convulsed</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 sobs,	 though	 not	 a	 man	 present	 thought	 his	 emotion	 a	 thing	 to	 be ashamed	 of,	 all	 of	 us	 being	 deeply	 interested	 in	 his	 narrative	 and	 as anxious	 as	 himself	 for	 the	 skipper	 to	 start	 off	 in	 pursuit	 of	 the	 black mutineers	and	pirates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	were	not	long	kept	in	suspense,	the	colonel’s	last	words	and	violent</p>
<p class="calibre1">burst	of	emotion	apparently	touching	our	“old	man’s”	feelings	deeply,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">hastening	his	decision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cheer	 up,	 sir,	 cheer	 up,”	 said	 he	 to	 the	 other,	 whose	 shoulders	 still shook	with	his	deep	hysterical	sobs.	“And	we’ll	find	your	little	girl	yet	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	 all	 right,	 and	 restore	 her	 to	 you,	 and	 we’ll	 settle	 matters	 too,	 with those	scoundrels,	I	promise.	Now	tell	me	how	far	off	do	you	think	the	ship</p>
<p class="calibre1">must	have	drifted	from	us	by	now,	Mr	Fosset.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a>“Between	 twenty	 and	 thirty	 miles,	 sir,”	 replied	 the	 first	 mate.	 “She	 was lighter	than	us,	and	of	course	she	had	the	advantage	of	what	wind	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">has	been,	though,	thank	goodness,	that	has	been	little	enough!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Away	to	the	nor’-east,	I	suppose?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	 aye,	 sir,”	 said	 Mr	 Fosset.	 “The	 breeze,	 what	 there	 was,	 has	 been from	the	sou’-east	and	the	current	trends	in	the	same	direction.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	if	we	steer	east-nor’-east	we	ought	to	pick	her	up	soon?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	a	doubt	of	it,	sir.	We	have	four	good	hours	of	daylight	left	yet!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Precisely	 my	 opinion,”	 cried	 the	 skipper.	 “Mr	 Stokes,	 will	 the	 engines stand	full	speed	now,	do	you	think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	yes,	sir,”	replied	the	old	chief,	who	with	the	rest	of	us	was	all	agog	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 after	 the	 strange	 ship	 again,	 now	 that	 he	 had	 heard	 the	 colonel’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">explanation	 of	 her	 true	 character,	 “if	 you’ll	 send	 some	 one	 below	 to	 tell Stoddart	what	you	want.	I	would	go	myself,	but	I’m	rather	shaky	in	getting</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	the	hatchway	as	yet.	I	twisted	my	arm	just	now	when	I	went	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 all	 right.	 Stoddart,	 I	 am	 sure,	 will	 excuse	 you,”	 said	 the	 skipper kindly,	 and	 turning	 to	 me	 he	 added:	 “You,	 Haldane,	 run	 down	 and	 tell</p>
<p class="calibre1">Stoddart	we	want	all	the	steam	we	can	get.	He	won’t	spare	the	engines,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">know,	when	he	knows	the	circumstances	of	the	case,	and	you	will	explain</p>
<p class="calibre1">matters!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	saying,	the	skipper	started	off	forwards	in	the	direction	of	the	bridge, </p>
<p class="calibre1">while	 I	 dived	 down	 the	 engine-room	 hatchway,	 reaching	 the	 machinery-</p>
<p class="calibre1">flat	 just	 as	 the	 “old	 man”	 sounded	 the	 gong	 to	 put	 on	 full	 speed	 ahead, the	telegraph	working	quick	as	if	he	were	in	a	great	hurry! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ere	I	could	tell	my	story	Stoddart	sent	an	answering	blast	up	the	steam</p>
<p class="calibre1">pipe	to	let	the	skipper	know	his	signal	was	being	attended	to;	and	then, </p>
<p class="calibre1">pulling	back	the	lever	of	the	throttle	valve,	the	piston	began	to	go	up	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">down,	 the	 cylinder	 oscillated	 from	 side	 to	 side	 and	 the	 crank	 shaft</p>
<p class="calibre1">revolved	at	first	slowly,	but	presently	faster	and	faster	until	we	were	now</p>
<p class="calibre1">going	to	the	utmost	of	our	pace. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a>All	this	while	I	was	yarning	away,	though	I	had	to	shout	to	the	top	of	my voice	in	order	to	overcome	the	noise	of	the	machinery,	as	I	described	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	had	occurred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	did	not	speak	to	unheeding	ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	Jove,	Haldane!”	cried	Stoddart,	who	was	a	man	of	action	if	ever	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	one.	“The	cylinder	is	all	right	again	and	will	bear	any	pressure	now, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 I	 tell	 you	 what	 it	 is,	 the	 old	 barquey	 shall	 steam	 along	 in	 pursuit	 of those	 demons	 faster	 than	 she	 ever	 went	 in	 her	 life	 since	 she	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">launched	and	engined!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 am	 with	 you	 there,	 old	 fellow,”	 said	 Grummet,	 our	 third	 engineer, </p>
<p class="calibre1">hastening	towards	the	stoke-hold.	“I’ll	go	down	and	see	the	firemen	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">stir	 them	 up	 and	 put	 some	 more	 oilers	 to	 work	 in	 the	 screw	 well,	 to lubricate	the	shaft	so	as	to	prevent	the	bearings	from	overheating.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	your	sort,	my	hearty,”	said	Stoddart.	“So	you	can	return	on	deck, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haldane,	and	tell	the	skipper	and	Mr	Stokes	that	everything	shall	be	done</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	here	by	us	to	overhaul	your	‘ghost-ship.’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	laughed	as	he	uttered	this	little	piece	of	chaff	at	my	expense,	the	story</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	 now	 the	 common	 property	 of	 everybody	 on	 board,	 and	 I	 laughed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">too,	 as	 I	 ran	 up	 the	 hatchway	 with	 my	 clothes	 nearly	 dry	 again,	 even drying	in	the	short	space	of	time	I	had	been	in	the	hot	atmosphere	below, </p>
<p class="calibre1">although,	goodness	knows,	they	had	been	wet	enough	when	I	had	gone</p>
<p class="calibre1">down,	 having	 had	 no	 time	 or	 opportunity	 to	 shift	 them	 after	 my	 dip</p>
<p class="calibre1">overboard	when	taking	the	line	to	the	drifting	boat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	reaching	the	main	deck	I	met	Spokeshave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 was	 coming	 out	 from	 the	 saloon,	 and	 from	 his	 puffy	 face	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">corpulent	 appearance	 generally,	 he	 looked	 as	 if	 he	 had	 been	 making	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">haul	on	the	steward’s	pantry,	although	he	had	not	long	had	his	dinner	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	was	a	good	way	off	tea	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hullo!”	 he	 cried	 out	 on	 seeing	 me.	 “I	 say,	 that	 chap	 O’Neil	 is	 having	 a fine	go	of	it	playing	at	doctoring.	He	has	got	a	lot	of	ugly	long	knives	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">saws	 laid	 out	 on	 the	 cuddy	 table	 and	 I	 think	 he’s	 going	 to	 cut	 off	 the chap’s	leg!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>“Which	chap	do	you	mean?”	I	asked;	“not	the	colonel?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,”	said	he.	“The	chap	with	the	moustache	and	long	hair,	like	Hamlet, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you	know!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	 good	 chap,”	 said	 I,	 “you	 seem	 to	 know	 a	 good	 deal	 about	 other</p>
<p class="calibre1">chaps,	 or	 think	 you	 do,	 but	 I	 never	 heard	 before	 of	 Hamlet	 having	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">moustache	like	a	life-guardsman!	Irving	doesn’t	wear	one	when	he	takes</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	part,	if	I	recollect	right,	my	joker.	You	think	yourself	mighty	knowing!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quite	 so,”	 replied	 Master	 Spokeshave,	 using	 his	 favourite	 phrase	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">usual.	“But	you	don’t	call	Irving	Shakespeare,	Haldane,	do	ye?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	anything	of	the	matter,	old	boy.	I	am	not	so	well	informed	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	 are	 concerning	 the	 dramatic	 world,	 Spokeshave.	 I	 know	 you’re	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">regular	 authority	 or	 ‘toffer,’	 if	 you	 like,	 on	 the	 subject.	 Don’t	 you	 think, however,	you’re	a	bit	hard	on	poor	Irving,	who,	I’ve	no	doubt,	would	take</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 word	 of	 advice	 from	 you	 if	 you	 spoke	 kindly	 to	 him	 and	 without	 that cruel	sarcasm	which	you’re	apt	to	use?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 little	 beggar	 actually	 sniggered	 over	 this,	 being	 of	 the	 opinion	 that	 I was	paying	a	just	tribute	to	his	histrionic	acumen	and	judgement	in	things</p>
<p class="calibre1">theatrical,	on	which	he	prided	himself	on	account	of	his	having	appeared</p>
<p class="calibre1">once	behind	the	footlights	in	a	theatre	in	Liverpool,	as	a	“super,”	I	believe, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	in	a	part	where	he	had	nothing	to	say! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quite	 so,	 Haldane;	 quite	 so,”	 chuckled	 Spokeshave,	 as	 pleased	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Punch	 at	 the	 imaginary	 compliment.	 “<i class="calibre4">I	 do</i>	 believe	 I	 could	 teach	 Irving	 a thing	or	two	if	I	had	the	mind	to!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	you	donkey,	if	you	 <i class="calibre4">had</i>	the	mind	to,”	said	I	witheringly,	by	giving	an emphasis	he	did	not	mean	to	his	own	words.	“‘Very	like	a	whale,’	as	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">old	friend	Polonius	says	in	the	play,	the	real	 <i class="calibre4">Hamlet</i>,	I	mean,	my	boy,	not your	version	of	it.	‘Very	like	a	whale,’	indeed!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sure,	Mr	Haldane,”	he	answered	loftily,	cocking	his	long	nose	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">air	with	a	supercilious	sniff,	“I	don’t	know	what	ye	mean.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	I’ve	no	time	to	waste	telling	you	now,”	returned	I. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a>At	that	moment	we	emerged	on	the	open	deck	from	under	the	back	of	the poop,	 where	 we	 had	 been	 losing	 our	 time	 and	 talking	 nonsense;	 and, </p>
<p class="calibre1">looking	 towards	 the	 bridge	 forward,	 I	 saw	 Colonel	 Vereker,	 the	 very</p>
<p class="calibre1">person	 about	 whom	 we	 had	 been	 speaking,	 standing	 by	 the	 side	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">skipper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“O,	Lor’,	Spokeshave,	what	a	crammer!”	I	cried.	“You	said	not	a	moment</p>
<p class="calibre1">ago	that	Garry	O’Neil	was	about	to	cut	off	the	colonel’s	leg,	while	there	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	standing	there,	all	right!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	say	he	had	cut	it	off	yet,”	he	retorted;	“I	said	he	was	going	to	cut	it off.	O’Neil	told	me	so	himself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then,”	 said	 I,	 “instead	 of	 cutting	 off	 the	 poor	 colonel’s	 leg,	 he	 was	 only</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘pulling	your	leg,’	my	joker!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 cross-grained	 little	 beggar,	 however,	 did	 not	 seem	 to	 quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand	the	term	I	employed	thus	in	joke,	though	it	was	used	at	sea	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">express	the	fact	of	“taking	a	rise”	out	of	any	one,	and	a	common	enough</p>
<p class="calibre1">saying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 not	 the	 only	 fellow	 who	 tells	 crammers,”	 he	 grimly	 muttered.	 “How about	 that	 yarn	 of	 yours	 of	 the	 blessed	 ‘ghost-ship’	 you	 saw	 the	 other night,	I’d	like	to	know.	I	believe,	too,	that	the	colonel,	as	you	call	him,	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	an	impostor	and	that	the	skipper	is	going	on	just	such	a	wild-goose</p>
<p class="calibre1">chase	after	this	ship	of	his,	which	he	says	was	captured	by	pirates,	as	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">did	that	Friday	hunting	your	 <i class="calibre4">Flying	Dutchman</i>!	wasting	our	time	with	your</p>
<p class="calibre1">idiotic	 story.	 Pirates	 and	 niggers,	 indeed!	 Why,	 this	 chap,	 I’ll	 bet,	 is	 a nigger	himself,	and	more	of	a	pirate	than	any	one	we’ll	come	across	if	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">steam	 from	 here	 to	 the	 North	 Pole.	 Put	 that	 in	 your	 pipe	 and	 smoke	 it, Dick	Haldane;	you	and	your	confounded	‘ghost-ship’	together!	Such	utter</p>
<p class="calibre1">humbug	and	nonsense,	and	thinking	you	take	people	in	with	such	yarns</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	these	days!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Sixteen. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Full	Speed	Ahead. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a>I	was	so	indignant	at	what	the	spiteful	little	brute	said	that	I	incontinently turned	 on	 my	 heel	 and	 left	 him	 without	 another	 word,	 going	 forwards</p>
<p class="calibre1">towards	the	bridge	to	give	the	skipper	Stoddart’s	message. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here,	 the	 sight	 of	 Colonel	 Vereker’s	 grand	 figure—one	 that	 would	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">remarkable	anywhere,	towering	above	the	rail	and	almost	herculean	in	its</p>
<p class="calibre1">massive	 proportions,	 coupled	 with	 the	 sad	 look	 in	 his	 noble	 face,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	 reminded	 me	 somehow	 or	 other	 of	 one	 of	 the	 pictures	 of	 the	 old Cavaliers	 of	 the	 Stuart	 days,	 made	 me	 resent	 the	 more	 the	 baseless</p>
<p class="calibre1">imputation	of	his	being	an	imposter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 idea	 of	 such	 a	 thing	 being	 possible	 could	 only	 have	 occurred	 to	 an ignoble	 mind	 like	 that	 of	 Spokeshave;	 for	 one	 single	 glance	 at	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">distinguished-looking	 gentleman’s	 speaking	 countenance,	 with	 its	 finely-</p>
<p class="calibre1">chiselled	 features	 and	 lofty	 open	 brow,	 would	 have	 satisfied	 any</p>
<p class="calibre1">unprejudiced	 person	 that	 his	 was	 a	 nature	 incompatible	 with	 deceit	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">meanness,	even	in	the	most	remote	degree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 young	 Haldane!”	 exclaimed	 old	 Mr	 Stokes,	 whom	 I	 found	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Applegarth	and	the	colonel	when	I	reached	the	wheel-house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	those	smart	chaps	of	mine	down	below	say,	hey,	my	boy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	face	beamed	as	he	spoke	and	he	looked	as	if	he	would	have	liked	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 rubbed	 his	 hands	 together	 in	 his	 old	 way	 when	 he	 felt	 particularly jolly,	 but	 unfortunately	 his	 crippled	 arm,	 which	 was	 still	 in	 a	 sling, prevented	that! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	that’s	all	right,	sir,”	I	replied	in	an	equally	cheery	tone,	the	old	chief’s genial	 address	 making	 me	 forget	 at	 once	 my	 anger	 at	 Spokeshave’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">contemptible	 nonsense.	 “Mr	 Stoddart	 directed	 me	 to	 tell	 the	 cap’en	 that he	may	go	on	ahead	as	usual,	as	he	likes,	for	everything	has	been	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">taut	and	secure	below	and	there	need	be	no	fear	of	another	mishap.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">says	 he	 intends	 driving	 the	 engines	 as	 they	 were	 never	 driven	 before, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	he	has	put	every	fireman	and	oiler	in	the	stoke-hold	on	the	job.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bravo!”	cried	the	skipper,	sounding	the	gong	again	and	yelling	down	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice-tube	that	led	below	like	one	possessed.	“Fire	up,	below	there,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">let	her	rip!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a>“Dear,	 dear,”	 panted	 Mr	 Stokes,	 whose	 fears	 for	 his	 engines,	 which	 he regarded	 with	 the	 affection	 which	 a	 young	 mother	 might	 bestow	 on	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">first	 baby,	 began	 to	 overcome	 his	 interest	 in	 the	 chase	 after	 the	 black pirates.	“I	hope	you	and	Stoddart,	between	you,	won’t	be	rash,	cap’en.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">hope—I	do	hope	you	won’t!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nonsense,	 Stokes,	 you	 old	 croker;	 just	 you	 shut	 up!”	 said	 the	 skipper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Keep	 her	 steady,	 east-nor’-east,	 helmsman!	 Now,	 my	 dear	 colonel,	 at</p>

<p class="calibre1">nightfall,	I’ll	wager!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hope	to	heaven	we	will,	Señor	Applegarth,”	replied	the	other	sadly,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">eagerly.	“But,	alas!	the	ocean	is	wide,	and	we	may	miss	the	ship.	I	cannot</p>
<p class="calibre1">bear	to	think	of	it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	but	we	won’t	miss	her!”	said	the	skipper	confidently,	and	he	was	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">last	man	to	give	up	hope.	“Take	my	davy	for	that,	sir.	She	must	be	within</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 radius	 of	 from	 twenty	 to	 thirty	 miles	 of	 our	 present	 bearings	 on	 the chart,	somewhere	here	away	to	the	eastwards,	sir;	and	if	we	make	a	long</p>
<p class="calibre1">leg	to	leeward	and	then	bear	up	to	the	north’ard	and	west’ard	again,	we’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">overhaul	 her—I’m	 sure	 of	 it—yes,	 sure	 of	 it,	 in	 no	 time.	 Look,	 colonel, look	how	we’re	going	now.	By	George,	ain’t	that	a	bow	wave	for	you,	sir, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	just	see	our	wake	astern!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 old	 barquey	 was	 certainly	 steaming	 ahead	 at	 a	 great	 rate,	 the	 sea coming	up	before	her	in	a	high	ridge	that	nearly	topped	the	fo’c’s’le,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">welling	 under	 her	 counter	 on	 either	 hand	 in	 undulating	 furrows	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">spread	out	beneath	her	stern	in	the	form	of	a	broad	arrow,	widening	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">distance	 apart	 as	 she	 moved	 onward,	 while	 the	 space	 between	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">frosted	as	if	with	silver	by	the	white	foam	churned	up	by	the	ever-whirling</p>
<p class="calibre1">propeller	blades,	beating	the	water	with	their	rhythmical	iteration,	thump-</p>
<p class="calibre1">thump,	thump-thump,	thump-thump! </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 no	 “racing”	 of	 the	 screw	 now,	 for	 Neptune	 was	 in	 one	 of	 his quiet	 moods	 and	 there	 were	 no	 big	 rollers	 to	 surmount,	 or	 deep	 wave</p>
<p class="calibre1">valleys	to	descend	into;	consequently	the	old	barquey	had	no	excuse	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">giving	 way	 to	 any	 gambolling	 propensities	 in	 the	 water	 of	 pitching	 and tossing,	steaming	away	on	an	even	keel	and	using	every	inch	of	power	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>her	engines,	with	not	an	ounce	to	waste	in	the	way	of	mis-spent	force! </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 so	 on	 we	 went,	 tearing	 through	 the	 water,	 a	 blue	 sky	 overhead</p>
<p class="calibre1">unflecked	by	a	single	cloud,	a	blue	sea	around	that	sparkled	in	sunshine</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 reflected	 harmonies	 of	 azure	 and	 gold,	 save	 where	 the	 bright	 fresh western	 breeze	 rippled	 its	 surface	 with	 laughing	 wavelets	 that	 chuckled</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	they	splashed	the	spray	into	each	other’s	faces,	or	where	we	passed</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 stray	 scrap	 of	 gulf-weed	 with	 its	 long	 yellow	 filaments	 spread	 out	 like fingers	vainly	clutching	at	the	wavelets	as	if	imploring	them	to	be	still,	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	again	the	dense	black	smoke	from	our	funnels	made	a	canopy	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	sky	athwart	our	track,	obscuring	the	shimmering	surface	of	the	deep</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 a	 grim	 path	 of	 shadow	 that	 checked	 the	 mirth	 of	 the	 lisping	 young wavelets	 and	 even	 awed	 the	 sunshine	 when	 it	 came	 in	 closer	 contact</p>
<p class="calibre1">anon,	as	the	wind	waved	it	this	way	and	that	at	its	will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi,	bo’sun!”	shouted	out	the	skipper	presently,	after	carrying	on	like	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	a	goodish	spell,	the	deck	working	beneath	our	feet	and	the	 <i class="calibre4">Star	of	the</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">North</i>	 seeming	 to	 be	 flying	 through	 water	 and	 air	 alike	 by	 a	 series	 of leaps	and	bounds,	quivering	down	to	her	very	kelson	with	the	sustained</p>
<p class="calibre1">motion	and	the	ever-driving	impulse	of	her	masterful	engines	spurring	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">onward.	“How	is	she	going	now,	eh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Old	 Masters	 was	 away	 aft	 on	 the	 poop	 hauling	 in	 the	 patent	 log,	 which had	 been	 hove	 over	 the	 side	 on	 our	 beginning	 the	 run,	 and	 the	 next</p>
<p class="calibre1">minute,	as	soon	as	he	was	able	to	look	at	the	index	of	the	instrument,	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">answered	the	skipper’s	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sixteen	knots,	sir!”	he	sang	out,	and	then	we	could	hear	the	old	sea	dog</p>
<p class="calibre1">add	 his	 customary	 comment,	 whether	 of	 approval	 or	 discontent,	 “Well, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	blowed!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	George,	colonel!”	cried	Captain	Applegarth	to	our	melancholy-looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">guest	at	his	side.	“We’re	going	sixteen	knots,	sir;	just	think	of	that!	I	didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe	the	dear	old	barquey	had	it	in	her!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	a	good,	wonderful	speed,	captain,”	replied	the	other,	who,	I	noticed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">was	looking	even	more	exhausted	now	than	when	we	removed	him	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 boat.	 “Remember,	 though,	 sir,	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Saint	 Pierre</i>	 is	 sailing	 on	 all	 this time	before	the	wind,	as	she	was	this	morning	and	must	be	miles	ahead</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>of	us!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	I	know	she’s	going;	or	at	least,	I	suppose	so,	and	I’ve	made	every</p>
<p class="calibre1">allowance	 for	 that	 in	 my	 calculation	 of	 her	 whereabouts,”	 returned	 our</p>
<p class="calibre1">skipper,	 in	 nowise	 daunted	 by	 the	 colonel’s	 argument.	 “But	 if	 she	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">every	rag	set	that	she	could	carry,	she	couldn’t	go	more	than	three	or	four</p>
<p class="calibre1">knots	at	the	most,	in	this	light	breeze;	and	for	every	foot	she	covers	we’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">going	five!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 is	 true,”	 said	 the	 American,	 with	 a	 very	 weary	 and	 absent	 look	 on his	 face.	 “But—but	 I’m	 afraid	 we	 may	 be	 too	 late	 after	 all!	 I—I’m—God protect—my—my—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 fact	 is,	 my	 dear	 sir,”	 cried	 the	 skipper	 abruptly,	 interrupting	 him	 as the	other	hesitated	in	his	speech,	turning	a	deadly	white	and	clutching	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	bridge	rail	in	front	of	him,	as	if	to	save	himself	from	falling	or	fainting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	 completely	 worn	 out	 and	 your	 nerves	 shaken!	 Why,	 you	 can’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 had	 much,	 if	 any,	 sleep	 the	 last	 three	 or	 four	 days—not	 since	 that rumpus	broke	out	aboard	your	ship,	eh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Heavens!”	 ejaculated	 the	 other.	 “I	 don’t	 think	 I	 have	 closed	 my	 eyes, señor,	 since	 Friday,	 excepting	 when	 I	 was	 drifting	 in	 the	 boat,	 part	 of which	time	I	must	have	been	senseless;	for	though	I	recollect	seeing	your</p>
<p class="calibre1">vessel	 and	 trying	 to	 signal	 her	 by	 holding	 up	 a	 piece	 of	 the	 bottom</p>
<p class="calibre1">planking	 of	 the	 boat,	 as	 we	 hadn’t	 oar	 or	 sail	 in	 her,	 I	 have	 no</p>
<p class="calibre1">remembrance	 of	 seeing	 your	 vessel	 steaming	 up	 to	 help	 us,	 or	 of	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1">brave	young	gentleman	here	jumping	into	the	water	and	swimming	to	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">assistance,	as	you	tell	me,	captain,	that	he	gallantly	did.	Believe	me,	sir,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">shall	never	forget	you,	and	I	shall	be	ever	and	eternally	grateful	to	you	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	noble	act	of	yours!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 half-turned	 and	 bowed	 to	 me	 politely	 as	 he	 said	 this,	 but	 I	 was	 too much	 confused	 by	 his	 exaggerated	 estimate	 of	 what	 I	 had	 done	 to	 say</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything	at	the	moment	in	reply.	And,	after	all,	it	was	only	a	very	simple</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing	 to	 do,	 to	 swim	 with	 a	 line	 to	 a	 boat;	 any	 other	 fellow	 could	 have done	the	same,	and	would	have	done	it	under	the	same	circumstances. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	skipper,	however,	spoke	for	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come,	come,	sir,”	he	said.	“Haldane	only	did	his	duty,	like	the	brave	lad</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>he	 is;	 and	 I’m	 sure	 you	 only	 make	 him	 uncomfortable	 by	 your	 thanks.	 I want	 you,	 colonel,	 to	 go	 below	 and	 have	 a	 little	 rest	 and	 some</p>
<p class="calibre1">refreshment.	 Besides,	 I	 promised	 Mr	 O’Neil	 to	 send	 you	 down	 to	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	wounded	leg	dressed	and	seen	to	more	than	half	an	hour	ago,	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	came	up	on	deck	after	attending	to	that	other	poor	chap,	and	yet	here</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	are	still,	talking	and	exciting	yourself.	How	is	your	leg	now,	colonel? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Easier?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Confound	 it!	 No,	 no!”	 replied	 the	 other,	 with	 a	 writhe	 of	 torture	 as	 he changed	 his	 position	 so	 as	 to	 relieve	 the	 strain	 on	 the	 wounded	 limb, which	 I	 had	 quite	 forgotten	 about,	 the	 brave	 follow	 having	 stoically</p>
<p class="calibre1">repressed	 all	 indication	 of	 pain	 while	 urging	 on	 the	 pursuit	 of	 the	 black mutineers.	“It’s	hurting	me	like	the	devil!	But,	sir,	I	cannot	rest	or	leave	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">deck	 till	 we	 come	 up	 to	 that	 accursed	 ship	 and	 save	 my	 poor	 child,	 my little	darling—if	we	be	not	too	late,	too	late!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 is	 nonsense,	 sir,”	 said	 the	 skipper	 bluntly,	 and	 rather	 angrily,	 I thought,	and	he	continued:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	ship,	we	know,	must	be	a	goodish	bit	ahead	of	us	still,	and	we	can’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">possibly	overhaul	her	for	an	hour	or	more	at	the	earliest.	So	come,	cheer</p>
<p class="calibre1">up,	 and	 come	 along	 with	 me	 and	 have	 your	 leg	 attended	 to	 at	 once.	 I insist,	colonel;	come.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,”	persisted	Colonel	Vereker,	evidently	trying	to	make	out	the	time	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">arguing,	and	loth	to	leave	the	scene	of	action,	though	apparently	ready	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">drop	now	from	sheer	pain	and	exhaustion	combined,	“Who	will—who	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	 first	 officer	 here,	 Mr	 Fosset,	 will	 remain	 on	 the	 bridge	 during	 our absence	 below,”	 interposed	 Captain	 Applegarth,	 anticipating	 his	 last, </p>
<p class="calibre1">unuttered	 objection.	 “He’s	 quite	 competent	 to	 take	 charge,	 and	 I’m	 sure will	 let	 us	 know	 the	 moment	 the	 ship	 comes	 in	 sight,	 if	 she	 appears</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	we	return	on	deck.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	that	I	will,	sir,”	cried	out	Mr	Fosset.	“I’ll	keep	a	sharp	look-out,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ll	 hail	 you,	 sir,	 sharp	 enough,	 as	 soon	 as	 she	 heaves	 in	 sight	 on	 the horizon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There!”	 exclaimed	 the	 skipper	 in	 an	 exultant	 tone,	 taking	 hold	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a>colonel’s	 reluctant	 arm	 and	 placing	 it	 within	 his	 own,	 so	 as	 to	 lead	 him away	 and	 to	 give	 him	 the	 benefit	 of	 his	 support	 down	 the	 bridge-ladder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Won’t	that	satisfy	you	now,	sir,	and	you	see	you’ll	lose	nothing	by	going</p>
<p class="calibre1">below	for	a	spell?	Come,	come,	my	good	friend,	have	the	leg	seen	to	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">eat	something,	for	you	must	require	it.	Why,	colonel,	unless	you	keep	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	strength	and	spur	yourself	up	a	bit	you	won’t	be	able	to	tackle	those</p>
<p class="calibre1">black	 scoundrels	 when	 we	 get	 up	 to	 the	 ship	 and	 catch	 them	 and	 it</p>
<p class="calibre1">comes	 to	 a	 fight,	 as	 I	 expect	 it	 will.	 So	 come	 along,	 my	 hearty;	 rouse yourself	and	come!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 concluding	 remark	 of	 the	 old	 skipper	 affected	 more	 than	 all	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">previous	 persuasion,	 the	 colonel	 at	 once	 allowing	 himself	 to	 be	 helped</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	the	laddering	without	further	demur,	and	so	along	the	gangway	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	upper	deck,	towards	the	lower	entrance	to	the	saloon	under	the	beak</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	poop,	I	lending	the	aid	of	my	shoulder	for	the	crippled	man	to	lean</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	as	he	limped	painfully	onward,	having	to	pause	at	almost	every	step, </p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 wounded	 leg	 dragging	 now	 so	 much,	 now	 that	 excitement	 no	 longer</p>
<p class="calibre1">sustained	his	flagging	frame;	the	skipper	gave	aid	too,	his	arm	propping</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	up	on	the	other	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Seventeen. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Doctor	and	Patient. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith,	it’s	moighty	glad	I	am,	sor,	to	say	you	at	last!”	cried	Garry	O’Neil, </p>
<p class="calibre1">starting	up	from	his	seat	at	the	cuddy	table,	on	our	ultimately	reaching	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">saloon,	 where	 the	 Irish	 mate	 was	 having	 a	 rather	 late	 lunch	 with	 Mr</p>
<p class="calibre1">Stokes,	 who	 had	 preceded	 us	 below.	 “I	 was	 jist	 comin’	 after	 ye	 ag’in, colonel,	 whin	 I	 had	 snatched	 a	 bit	 mouthful	 to	 kape	 the	 divvil	 out	 of	 me stomach,	sure.	I	want	to	inspict	that	game	leg	o’	yours,	sor,	now	that	I’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">sittled	your	poor	f’ind’s	h’id.	Begorrah,	colonel,	somebody	gave	him	a	tidy</p>
<p class="calibre1">rap	on	the	skull	whin	they	were	about	it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	done	with	a	hand-spike,”	explained	the	other,	groaning	with	pain</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 we	 assisted	 him	 to	 a	 seat	 at	 the	 further	 end	 of	 the	 table,	 where	 the skipper’s	armchair	was	drawn	out	for	him	to	fix	him	up	more	comfortably. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	of	those	treacherous	niggers	came	behind	his	back	and	dealt	him	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a>terrific	blow	that	landed	on	the	side	of	his	head	partly,	nearly	cutting	his ear	off!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	 I	 saw	 that,	 sor,	 of	 course,”	 put	 in	 Garry,	 pouring	 out	 some	 brandy into	a	tumbler	which	he	proceeded	to	fill	up	with	water—“<i class="calibre4">aqua	pura</i>,”	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">called	it.	“I’ve	shtrapped	it	on	ag’in	now,	and	it	looks	as	nate	as	ninepins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 jist	 dhrink	 this,	 colonel,	 dear.	 It’ll	 warrm	 the	 cockles	 of	 your	 heart, sure,	an’	put	frish	loife	into	you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	American	took	a	sip	first	at	the	glass	proffered	him,	and	then	drained</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	the	contents	with	a	deep	sigh	of	satisfaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah!”	 he	 exclaimed,	 “I	 feel	 a	 little	 better.	 But	 how	 is	 poor	 Captain</p>
<p class="calibre1">Alphonse	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bedad,	 he’s	 gitting	 on	 illegantly,”	 replied	 Garry,	 sniffing	 at	 a	 soup	 plate containing	 some	 steaming	 compound	 which	 Weston,	 the	 steward,	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	 brought	 in,	 and	 directing	 that	 worthy	 to	 place	 it	 in	 front	 of	 our	 poor invalid	 guest.	 “There	 was	 a	 nasty	 paice	 of	 bone	 sphlinter	 sticking	 in	 the crayture’s	 brainpan;	 but,	 first,	 I	 trepanned	 him	 an’	 raymoved	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">impiddimint,	 an’	 the	 poor	 chap’s	 now	 slayping	 as	 swately	 as	 a	 babby, </p>
<p class="calibre1">slayping	in	the	cap’en’s	cot	over	yonder!	But	come,	colonel,	I	want	ye	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">take	 some	 of	 this	 pay	 soup	 here	 afore	 I	 set	 to	 work	 carving	 ye	 about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Begorrah,	it’s	foine	stuff,	an’ll	set	ye	up	a	bit	to	roights!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	 you	 a	 thousand	 times,”	 returned	 he,	 taking	 a	 mouthful	 or	 two	 of the	 soup	 which	 Weston	 had	 placed	 before	 him,	 eating	 very	 sparingly	 at</p>
<p class="calibre1">first	like	one	who	had	been	deprived	of	food	for	some	time.	“I’m	not	afraid</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	your	handling	me,	sir.	I	have	undergone	too	many	operations	for	that!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith,	colonel,”	cried	the	Irishman,	laughing	in	his	usual	good-tempered</p>
<p class="calibre1">racy	manner,	“you’d	best	spake	well	of	the	craft	or	I’ll	be	afther	payin’	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">out,	 sure,	 alannah,	 whin	 I	 get	 your	 leg	 in	 me	 grip!	 Jist	 you	 stow	 some more	o’	that	illigint	soup	inside	your	belt,	sor,	before	I	start	on	the	job,	an’</p>
<p class="calibre1">while	ye’re	aitin’	I’ll	tell	you	how	I	once	sarved	out	an	old	woman	whom	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	called	in	to	docther,	whin	I	was	at	ould	Trinity,	larnin’	the	profession, </p>
<p class="calibre1">in	faith!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 right,	 O’Neil,”	 said	 the	 skipper,	 seeing	 his	 motive	 in	 trying	 to	 set our	 sad	 guest	 at	 his	 ease	 and	 to	 try	 and	 distract	 his	 thoughts	 from	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a>awful	anxiety	and	grief	under	which	he	was	labouring.	“Have	I	heard	the yarn	before,	eh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith,	not	that	I	know	of,	cap’en,”	returned	the	doctor	 <i class="calibre4">pro	tem</i>	in	his	free and	easy	manner.	“Begorrah,	the	joke’s	too	much	ag’inst	meself,	sor,	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	to	be	afther	tillin’	the	story	too	often!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never	 mind	 that;	 it	 will	 make	 it	 all	 the	 more	 interesting	 to	 us,”	 said	 the skipper	with	a	knowing	wink	to	Mr	Stokes,	both	of	them	knowing	Garry’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">old	 stories	 only	 too	 well,	 but	 at	 such	 a	 time	 as	 this	 they	 would	 have listened	 to	 anything	 if	 it	 would	 only	 serve	 to	 distract	 the	 poor	 colonel’s thoughts	for	a	few	minutes,	and	they	chuckled	in	recollection	of	the	many</p>
<p class="calibre1">jokes	 against	 himself	 that	 Garry	 had	 perpetrated.	 “Fire	 away	 with	 your</p>
<p class="calibre1">yarn.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bedad,	 then,	 here	 goes,”	 began	 O’Neil	 with	 a	 grin.	 “Ye	 must	 know, </p>
<p class="calibre1">colonel,	 if	 you	 will	 have	 it,	 that	 I	 was	 only	 a	 ‘sucking	 sawbones,’	 so	 to spake,	at	the	toime.	Faith,	I	was	a	medical	studint	in	my	first	year,	having</p>
<p class="calibre1">barely	mastered	the	bones.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 bones!”	 interrupted	 the	 skipper.	 “What	 the	 deuce	 do	 you	 mean, </p>
<p class="calibre1">man?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,	 the	 inthroductory	 study	 of	 anatomy,	 sor,”	 explained	 Garry	 rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">grandiloquently,	 going	 on	 with	 his	 yarn.	 “Well,	 one	 foine	 day	 whin	 I	 an’</p>
<p class="calibre1">another	 fellow	 who’d	 kept	 the	 same	 terms	 as	 mesilf	 were	 walking	 the</p>

<p class="calibre1">We	 were	 all	 very	 much	 amused	 and	 had	 a	 good	 laugh	 at	 this	 naïve</p>

<p class="calibre1">understand	beforehand	that	it	would	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	 George!”	 cried	 the	 skipper,	 after	 having	 his	 laugh	 out,	 “you’ll	 be	 the death	of	me	some	day	with	your	queer	yarns	if	you	can’t	manage	to	do</p>

<p class="calibre1">“No	fear	of	that,	cap’en;	you’re	too	tough	a	customer,”	rejoined	the	doctor</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	a	knowing	look	in	the	direction	of	Mr	Stokes,	who	had	made	himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">purple	 in	 the	 face	 and	 was	 panting	 and	 puffing	 on	 his	 seat,	 trying	 to recover	his	breath.	“Faith,	though,	sor,	talkin’	of	medical	skill,	the	sooner	I</p>

<p class="calibre1">“With	 the	 best	 of	 wills,”	 assented	 the	 colonel,	 who	 had	 finished	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">luncheon	 by	 this	 time	 and	 certainly	 presented	 a	 much	 improved</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>“Belay	 that,	 colonel;	 none	 o’	 your	 chaff	 about	 the	 ould	 leddy,	 if	 you	 love me,	sure!”	growled	Garry,	pretending	to	be	indignant	as	he	knelt	down	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	cabin	floor	and	slit	up	the	leg	of	the	colonel’s	trousers	so	as	to	inspect</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 wound.	 His	 nonsensical,	 quizzing	 manner	 changed	 instantly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">however,	 on	 seeing	 the	 serious	 state	 of	 the	 injured	 limb,	 and	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">ejaculated	in	a	subdued	tone	of	voice,	“Holy	Moses!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why,	sir,”	said	the	patient	quietly,	“what’s	the	matter	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	 an’	 ye	 are	 axin’	 what’s	 the	 mather?”	 cried	 Garry	 in	 a	 still	 more astonished	 tone.	 “Faith,	 it’s	 wantin’	 to	 know	 I	 am	 how	 the	 divvle	 you’ve iver	been	able	to	move	about	at	all,	at	all,	colonel,	with	that	thing	there. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It	 was,	 in	 truth,	 a	 fearful-looking	 object,	 being	 swollen	 to	 the	 most</p>
<p class="calibre1">abnormal	proportions	from	the	ankle	joint	to	the	thigh,	while	the	skin	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 a	 dark	 hue,	 save	 where	 some	 extravasated	 blood	 clustered	 about	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">small	punctured	orifice	just	above	the	knee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Colonel	Vereker	laughed	and	shrugged	his	shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	fortune	of	war,”	he	explained.	“One	of	those	brutes	shot	me	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	mark	is,	but	I	think	the	bullet	travelled	all	round	my	thigh	and	lodged</p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhere	in	the	groin,	I	fancy,	for	I	feel	a	lump	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,	I	wonder	you	can	fale	anythin’!”	cried	Garry,	who	was	probing	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	missile	all	the	time.	“A	man	that	can	walk	about,	faith,	loike	an	opera</p>
<p class="calibre1">dancer,	with	a	blue-mouldy	leg	loike	that,	can’t	have	much	faling	at	all,	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">all,	I’m	thinkin’!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah!”	 groaned	 his	 patient	 at	 last,	 on	 his	 touching	 the	 obnoxious	 bullet near	 the	 spot	 the	 colonel	 had	 indicated.	 “Whew!	 that	 hurts	 at	 any	 rate, doctor!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	be	aisy	a	minnit,	me	darlint,”	said	the	other	soothingly,	exchanging</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	probe	for	a	pair	of	forceps	and	proceeding	deftly	to	extract	the	leaden</p>
<p class="calibre1">messenger.	“An’	if	ye	can’t	be	aisy,	faith,	try	an’	be	as	aisy	as	ye	can!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	another	second	he	had	it	out	with	a	triumphant	and	gleeful	shout. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a>“Ah!”	ejaculated	the	colonel,	the	excessive	pain	causing	him	to	clench	his teeth	with	an	audible	snap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith,	you	may	say	‘ah’	now	as	much	as	you	please,”	said	Garry,	as	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">held	 out	 the	 villainous-looking	 bullet	 gripped	 in	 his	 forceps.	 “For	 there’s the	baste	that	did	you	all	the	damage,	an’	we’ll	soon	pull	you	up,	alannah, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with	that	ugly	paice	of	mischief	out	of	the	way,	sure!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh!	 dear	 me!”	 the	 poor	 colonel	 exclaimed	 as	 the	 doctor	 went	 on</p>
<p class="calibre1">dressing	 the	 wound	 and	 afterwards	 set-to	 to	 bandage	 the	 whole	 leg, </p>
<p class="calibre1">swathing	it	round	like	a	mummy	with	lint,	and	then	saturating	it	with	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">liniment	to	allay	the	swelling.	“Would	to	God	all	the	mischief	could	be	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">easily	made	good!	Oh,	my	little	Elsie,	my	darling	little	girl!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cheer	up,	colonel,	cheer	up,”	whispered	the	skipper,	coming	in	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">state	 room	 on	 the	 starboard	 side	 of	 the	 saloon,	 whither	 he	 had	 gone	 to hunt	 up	 some	 special	 cigars	 while	 Garry	 O’Neil	 was	 accomplishing	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">surgical	operation.	“We’re	going	ahead	as	fast	as	steam	and	a	good	ship</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Certainly!”	 said	 Colonel	 Vereker,	 leaning	 back	 in	 his	 easy	 chair	 when</p>
<p class="calibre1">Garry	O’Neil	had	made	an	end	of	bandaging	his	leg,	and	accepting	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 choice	 cigars	 the	 skipper	 offered	 him.	 “I	 will	 tell	 you	 willingly, captain,	 and	 you,	 gentlemen,	 turning	 round	 and	 bowing	 to	 us,	 the	 sad</p>
<p class="calibre1">story	of	our	thrice	ill-fated	voyage.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thrice	 ill-fated?”	 repeated	 Mr	 Stokes	 inquiringly,	 the	 chief	 being	 rather argumentative	by	nature	and	possessing	what	he	called	a	strictly	logical</p>
<p class="calibre1">turn	of	mind.	“But	how’s	that,	sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	colonel	had	his	answer	quite	ready. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	said	‘thrice	ill-fated’	advisedly,	sir,”	he	replied,	removing	his	cigar	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 lips	 to	 emit	 a	 cloud	 of	 perfumed	 smoke,	 and	 then	 restoring	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fragrant	roll	of	tobacco	to	the	mouth	again.	“In	the	first	place,	sir,	from	my</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a>having	 been	 unlucky	 enough	 ever	 to	 start	 upon	 the	 voyage	 at	 all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Secondly,	 from	 the	 fact	 of	 a	 calm	 delaying	 us	 when	 passing	 between</p>
<p class="calibre1">Puerto	 Rico	 and	 San	 Domingo,	 thereby	 enabling	 those	 treacherous</p>
<p class="calibre1">negro	scoundrels	to	see	our	ship	in	time	to	put	out	for	us	from	the	shore; </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	thirdly,	because	Captain	Alphonse	would	not	take	my	advice	and	use</p>
<p class="calibre1">strong	measures	when	the	mutiny	originally	broke	out,	which	might	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">prevented	the	terrible	events	that	afterwards	occurred!	But,	sir,	if	you	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">allow	me,	I	shall	get	along	better	by	telling	you	what	happened	just	in	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">own	way!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly,	 sir,”	 immediately	 replied	 Mr	 Stokes,	 profuse	 in	 his	 apologies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pray	pardon	my	interruption!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 colonel	 bowed	 in	 token	 of	 his	 forgiveness	 and	 then	 resumed	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">yarn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our	ship,	the	 <i class="calibre4">Saint	Pierre</i>,	of	Marseilles,	Jacques	Alphonse	master	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">part	owner,	sailed	from	La	Guayra	on	October	25,	barely	a	fortnight	ago!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said	he.	“In	addition	to	her	captain,	of	course,	she	carried	two	mates	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 crew	 of	 twenty-five	 hands	 all	 told,	 and	 she	 was	 bound	 for	 Liverpool, with	 a	 general	 cargo	 of	 cocoa,	 coffee	 and	 hides,	 besides	 a	 mixed</p>
<p class="calibre1">assortment	 of	 indigo,	 orris	 root,	 sarsaparilla	 and	 other	 raw	 drugs	 for	 the English	market.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Were	you	and	your	little	daughter	the	only	passengers?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 Señor	 Applegarth,”	 replied	 the	 other.	 “There	 were	 also	 on	 board</p>
<p class="calibre1">Monsieur	and	Madame	Boisson,	from	Caracas,	returning	home	to	Europe</p>
<p class="calibre1">after	 a	 lengthened	 residence	 in	 the	 Venezuelan	 capital,	 where	 they	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">carried	on	a	large	millinery	business,	supplying	the	dusky	 <i class="calibre4">señoritas</i>	of	the hybrid	 Spanish	 and	 native	 republic	 with	 the	 latest	 Parisian	 modes;	 Don</p>
<p class="calibre1">Miguel,	the	proprietor	of	an	extensive	estancia	in	the	interior;	and	little	Mr</p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnson,	a	Britisher,	of	not	much	account	in	your	country,	I	guess,	not	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">gentleman—at	 all	 events,	 in	 my	 humble	 opinion.	 He	 was	 travelling	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	 mercantile	 house	 in	 London	 connected	 with	 the	 manufactory	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">chocolates	 or	 sweets,	 or	 something	 of	 that	 sort.	 I	 cannot	 say	 I	 cared much	for	the	lot,	as	they	were	not	people	of	my	class,	so	I	did	not	allow</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	Elsie,	my	darling,	my	pet,	to	associate	with	them	more	than	could	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">helped,	 save	 with	 Madame	 Boisson,	 who	 was	 a	 kind,	 good-natured	 sort</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>of	woman,	though	decidedly	vulgar.	Oh	dear	me!	It	was	a	thousand	pities we	ever	started	on	that	disastrous	voyage.	It	was	unlucky	from	the	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">first!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith!”	interposed	Garry	O’Neil.	“But	how	was	that,	sor?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 were	 too	 late	 in	 reaching	 La	 Guayra	 in	 the	 first	 instance,”	 replied Colonel	 Vereker.	 “I	 had	 planned,	 my	 friend,	 to	 take	 the	 French	 steamer for	 Brest,	 but	 on	 arriving	 at	 the	 port	 I	 found	 she	 had	 already	 left,	 and while	 deliberating	 about	 what	 I	 should	 do	 under	 the	 circumstances—for</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	 would	 not	 be	 another	 mail	 boat	 for	 a	 fortnight	 at	 least—I	 met</p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	 Alphonse.	 He	 was	 an	 old	 friend	 of	 mine,	 a	 friend	 of	 long</p>
<p class="calibre1">standing,	 so,	 on	 his	 telling	 me	 that	 his	 vessel	 was	 going	 to	 sail	 on	 the following	day	and	would	probably	convey	me	to	Brest,	where	he	said	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 have	 to	 report	 himself	 prior	 to	 proceeding	 to	 Liverpool	 with	 his cargo,	quite	as	soon	as	I	should	arrive	if	I	waited	for	the	next	steamer,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">made	up	my	mind	to	accompany	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,	 colonel,”	 suggested	 Captain	 Applegarth,	 “you	 might	 have	 gone</p>
<p class="calibre1">direct	to	England	by	one	of	the	West	India	mail	steamers	which	touch	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">La	Guayra	on	their	route	homeward	from	Colon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	that,	my	friend,”	said	the	other.	“I	could	have	caught	one	of	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	following	week.	This	would	not	have	suited	my	purpose,	however,	sir. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 wished	 to	 proceed	 direct	 to	 Brest,	 for	 I	 could	 get	 easily	 on	 to	 Paris, where	 I	 intended	 placing	 my	 little	 Elsie	 at	 school	 in	 the	 convent	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">L’enfant	Jesu,	at	Neuilly,	under	the	guardianship	of	some	good	nuns,	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">whom	her	poor	mother	was	educated	and	brought	up.	It	was	a	promise, </p>
<p class="calibre1">my	friend,	to	the	dead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 see,	 colonel,”	 rejoined	 the	 skipper	 apologetically,	 lighting	 his	 cigar again,	having	allowed	it	to	go	out	while	listening	to	the	other;	“I	see,	sir. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Go	on;	I’m	all	attention.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 then,”	 continued	 the	 colonel,	 “these	 preliminaries	 being	 all</p>
<p class="calibre1">arranged,	 Elsie	 and	 I	 went	 aboard	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Saint	 Pierre</i>,	 a	 full-rigged	 sailing ship	of	some	eight	hundred	tons,	the	morning	of	the	twenty-eighth	of	last</p>
<p class="calibre1">month;	and	on	the	evening	of	the	same	day,	as	I	have	already	told	you, </p>
<p class="calibre1">we	made	sail	and	quitted	the	anchorage	where	the	ship	had	been	loading</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>—abreast	 of	 San	 Miguel,	 a	 port	 that	 guards	 the	 roadstead	 to	 the eastward,	where	it	is	open	to	the	sea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	 I	 know	 La	 Guayra	 well,	 colonel,”	 put	 in	 the	 skipper	 at	 this	 point, showing	that	he	was	following	every	detail.	“I	was	in	the	Royal	Mail	Line</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	I	was	a	nipper,	before	joining	my	present	company.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	recollect	the	night	we	sailed,”	resumed	the	other,	paying	no	attention	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Applegarth’s	remark,	but	speaking	with	his	eyes	fixed,	as	if	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">dream	 and	 seeing	 mentally	 before	 him	 the	 scenes	 he	 described.	 “The</p>
<p class="calibre1">moon	 was	 shining	 brightly	 when	 we	 got	 under	 way,	 lighting	 up	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Trinchera	 bastion	 and	 making	 the	 mountains	 in	 the	 background	 seem</p>
<p class="calibre1">higher	 than	 they	 were	 from	 the	 deep	 shadows	 they	 cast	 over	 the	 town</p>
<p class="calibre1">lying	 below.	 This	 latter	 lay	 embosomed	 amid	 a	 mass	 of	 tall	 cocoanut</p>
<p class="calibre1">trees	and	gorgeous	palms,	with	other	tropical	foliage,	and	had	a	shining</p>
<p class="calibre1">beach	of	white	sand	immediately	in	its	front,	stretching	round	the	curling</p>
<p class="calibre1">bay,	 on	 which	 the	 surf	 broke	 in	 the	 moonlight,	 with	 a	 phosphorescent</p>
<p class="calibre1">glow	and	a	hollow	sound	as	if	beating	over	a	grave.	Heavens!	It	was	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">grave	of	all	my	dearest	hopes	and	plans,	for	that,	sir,	was	one	of	the	few</p>
<p class="calibre1">last	 peaceful	 nights	 I	 have	 of	 late	 known,	 and	 very	 probably	 ever	 shall know	again!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith,	 don’t	 say	 that	 now,	 sir,”	 cried	 out	 Garry	 at	 this.	 “You’ll	 have	 a peaceful	one	to-night,	sure,	or	I’m	no	prophet.	Begorrah,	though,	I	niver</p>
<p class="calibre1">was,	so	far	as	that	goes!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 skipper	 grinned	 at	 this	 sympathetic	 interpolation,	 and	 the	 colonel’s sombre	 face	 lighted	 up	 a	 bit	 as	 he	 turned	 his	 pathetic	 eyes	 on	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">speaker,	as	if	wishing	to	share	his	hopefulness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	 doctor,	 you	 do	 not	 know	 what	 grief	 and	 anguish	 are	 like!”	 he	 said mournfully.	 “But	 to	 go	 on	 with	 my	 story.	 I	 may	 tell	 you	 that,	 had	 our voyage	 progressed	 like	 our	 start,	 I	 should	 have	 nothing	 to	 deplore,	 for, the	 land	 breeze	 filling	 our	 sails,	 we	 bore	 away	 buoyantly	 from	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Venezuelan	coast,	the	ship	shaping	a	course	north	by	west	towards	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mona	 passage,	 as	 the	 channel	 way	 is	 called,	 from	 a	 rock	 in	 its	 centre, lying	between	Hayti	and	Puerto	Rico.	This	route	is	held	to	be	the	best,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe,	 for	 passing	 out	 into	 the	 open	 Atlantic	 from	 the	 labyrinthine</p>
<p class="calibre1">groups	of	islands	and	innumerable	islets	that	gem	the	blue	waters	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a>Caribbean	 Sea.	 It	 is	 a	 course,	 too,	 which	 by	 its	 directness	 and	 the northerly	 current	 and	 westerly	 wind	 there	 to	 be	 met,	 saves	 a	 lot	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">useless	 tacking	 about	 and	 beating	 to	 windward,	 as	 you,	 no	 doubt, </p>
<p class="calibre1">captain,	very	well	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	skipper	nodded	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	 quite	 a	 sailor,	 colonel,”	 he	 said	 approvingly.	 “Where	 did	 you</p>
<p class="calibre1">manage	to	pick	up	your	knowledge	of	navigation	and	sea-faring	matters, </p>
<p class="calibre1">if	I	may	ask	the	question,	sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	the	many	voyages	I	have	made	during	a	somewhat	adventurous	life,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">replied	the	other.	“I	have	invariably	kept	my	ears	and	eyes	open,	captain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 are	 many	 things	 thus	 to	 be	 learnt,	 I	 have	 found	 out	 from</p>
<p class="calibre1">experience,	 which,	 although	 seemingly	 unimportant	 in	 themselves, </p>
<p class="calibre1">frequently	 turn	 out	 afterwards	 to	 be	 of	 very	 great	 use	 to	 us,	 sometimes, indeed,	almost	unexpectedly	so!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	 aye,	 colonel.	 My	 opinion,	 sir,	 right	 down	 to	 the	 ground,”	 said	 the skipper,	 looking	 towards	 me.	 “Just	 you	 put	 that	 in	 your	 pipe,	 Dick</p>
<p class="calibre1">Haldane,	and	smoke	it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 young	 sir,”	 added	 Colonel	 Vereker,	 emphasising	 this	 piece	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">advice.	 “That	 rule	 of	 life	 has	 stood	 me	 in	 good	 stead	 on	 more	 than	 one occasion,	both	on	land	and	on	shipboard.	Had	I	not	learnt	something	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	ways	of	your	sailors,	for	instance,	I	might	not	have	thought	of	lashing</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 <i class="calibre4">Saint	Pierre’s</i>	helm	amidships	on	the	breaking	out	of	the	mutiny,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	prevented	all	our	going	to	the	bottom	subsequently,	when	it	came	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	blow;	for	all	of	us	were	then	fighting	for	our	lives	and	no	one	had	time</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 attend	 to	 the	 ship,	 save	 in	 the	 way	 of	 letting	 go	 what	 ropes	 were handiest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	that	may	be	well	enough,	colonel,”	observed	the	skipper	in	his	dry</p>
<p class="calibre1">fashion.	 “But	 your	 argument	 cuts	 both	 ways.	 If	 your	 helm	 hadn’t	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">lashed	 down,	 remember,	 the	 ship	 would	 have	 been	 yawing	 about	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">drifting	 in	 this	 direction	 and	 that,	 and	 we	 should	 probably	 have	 come</p>
<p class="calibre1">across	her	long	ago,	like	that	boat	from	which	we	picked	you	up,	instead</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	her	bearing	away	right	before	the	wind	and	our	having	to	go	in	chase</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	her,	sir,	as	we	are	now	doing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>“It	 is	 true!	 I	 did	 not	 think	 of	 that!”	 returned	 the	 colonel	 impulsively,	 half-starting	 from	 his	 seat	 in	 his	 excitement.	 “We	 must	 be	 near	 her	 now, </p>
<p class="calibre1">captain,	 though,	 surely.	 We	 must	 find	 them,	 and	 I	 must	 see	 my	 little	 girl again!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kape	 aisy,	 me	 darlint;	 kape	 aisy,”	 here	 interposed	 Garry	 O’Neil,	 before Captain	 Applegarth	 could	 answer	 the	 question.	 “Sure,	 Mr	 Fosset</p>
<p class="calibre1">promised	 to	 give	 us	 the	 worrd	 whin	 she	 hove	 in	 sight,	 an’	 you’re	 only distarbin’	 yoursilf	 for	 nothing,	 colonel!	 More’s	 the	 pity,	 too,	 mabruchal, whin	 your	 leg	 is	 progressin’	 so	 illigantly	 an’	 the	 swillin’	 goin’	 down	 as swately	 as	 possible.	 Now	 kape	 aisy,	 if	 only	 to	 oblige	 me.	 Faith,	 colonel, me	profissional	reputation’s	at	shtake!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 Irishman	 all	 the	 time	 he	 was	 talking	 was	 carefully	 attending	 to	 the injured	 limb,	 loosening	 a	 bandage	 here,	 tightening	 another	 there,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">keeping	 the	 lint	 dressing	 moist	 the	 while	 with	 a	 lotion	 which	 he	 applied gently	to	the	surface	by	means	of	a	sponge.	So,	impressed	alike	by	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">tender	solicitude	thus	practically	shown	on	his	behalf	as	much	as	by	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">opportune	admonition,	the	colonel	was	forced	to	remain	quiet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 wish	 he’d	 be	 quick	 about	 it!”	 he	 muttered	 to	 himself.	 “Well,	 doctor,	 as you	 will	 not	 let	 me	 move,	 I	 suppose	 you	 will	 let	 me	 go	 on	 with	 my	 tale; that	is,	if	it	interests	you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	 aye;	 I	 want	 to	 hear	 everything,”	 said	 the	 skipper.	 “And	 fire	 away, colonel;	 there’s	 plenty	 of	 time	 for	 you	 to	 reel	 off	 your	 yarn	 before	 we overhaul	the	chase.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,—then,	I	will	proceed,”	replied	the	other.	“All	went	well	with	us	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 voyage	 until	 the	 afternoon	 of	 the	 third	 day	 after	 sailing	 from	 La Guayra,	 when,	 unfortunately,	 the	 weather	 changed	 and	 the	 westerly</p>
<p class="calibre1">wind,	 which	 had	 favoured	 us	 so	 far,	 suddenly	 failed	 us	 after	 wafting	 us through	 the	 Mona	 Passage,	 and	 we	 became	 becalmed	 off	 Cap	 San</p>
<p class="calibre1">Engaño,	to	the	northward	of	Hayti.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hayti!”	 exclaimed	 old	 Mr	 Stokes,	 waking	 up	 from	 a	 short	 nap	 he	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 having	 on	 the	 sly,	 and	 pretending	 to	 be	 keenly	 alive	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">conversation.	“That’s	the	famous	black	republic,	ain’t	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Famous	 black	 pandemonium,	 you	 mean!”	 retorted	 the	 colonel	 fiercely, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>his	 eyes	 flashing	 at	 once	 with	 fire.	 “Excuse	 me,	 sir,	 but	 I	 have	 seen	 so much	of	these	negro	brutes,	who	ape	the	airs	of	civilisation	and	yet	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	century	of	freedom	are	more	uncivilised	in	their	habits	and	mode	of	life</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	 the	 African	 slaves,	 their	 forefathers	 whom	 Toussaint-L’Overture,	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 styled	 himself,	 their	 leader,	 freed	 from	 the	 yoke	 of	 their	 French</p>
<p class="calibre1">masters	 a	 hundred	 years	 ago,	 that	 I	 feel	 the	 glorious	 name	 ‘republic’	 to be	 dishonoured	 when	 associated	 with	 such	 vile	 wretches,	 wretches	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">thousand	 times	 worse	 than	 the	 Fantees	 of	 the	 West	 Coast	 from	 whom</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	originally	sprang!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	dear	sir,”	said	Mr	Stokes,	aghast	at	the	tempest	he	had	raised	by	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">innocent	remark,	“you	surprise	me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Heavens!	 you	 would	 be	 surprised,	 sir,	 if	 you	 knew	 these	 Haytians	 as	 I know	them	to	be,”	continued	the	colonel,	his	indignation	still	struggling	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	mastery—“a	race	of	devil	worshippers	and	cannibals,	who	confound</p>
<p class="calibre1">liberty	 with	 license,	 and	 have	 added	 all	 the	 vices	 of	 civilisation	 to	 the inherent	savagery	of	their	innate	animal	nature.	Ah,	sir,	I	should	like	to	tell</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	 a	 great	 deal	 more,	 but	 have	 not	 the	 time	 now.	 I	 am	 afraid	 I	 am forgetting	myself.	Where	was	I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Becalmed	 off	 Cape	 San	 Engaño,”	 promptly	 replied	 the	 skipper,	 sailor</p>
<p class="calibre1">fashion—“at	least,	so	you	said,	colonel;	but	I	fancy	you	must	have	had	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	rougher	weather	in	that	latitude	than	you	mentioned	at	first!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 had,”	 said	 Colonel	 Vereker	 meaningly.	 “Towards	 nightfall	 we	 drifted</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	current	more	inshore,	Captain	Alphonse	not	dropping	our	anchor, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	we	expected	the	land	breeze	would	spring	up	at	sunset.	This	did	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">come	 for	 an	 hour	 later,	 however,	 for	 already	 darkness	 had	 begun	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">surround	us	and	we	could	see	the	fireflies	illuminating	the	brush	beyond</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	beach.	But	this	wasn’t	all	observed,	sir.	Just	as	our	sails	filled	again</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	the	ship	slowly	drew	out	into	the	offing,	we	heard	the	splash	of	oars</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	water	astern.	It	was	a	boat	coming	after	us,	propelled	by	a	dozen</p>
<p class="calibre1">oars	at	least,	pulling	as	hard	as	those	handling	them	knew	how,	a	shot	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">two	 from	 the	 shore	 and	 the	 sound	 of	 musket	 balls	 ripping	 the	 water</p>
<p class="calibre1">explaining,	 in	 some	 way,	 the	 reason	 for	 their	 anxiety	 to	 get	 beyond	 the range	of	the	firing,	on	which	account	they	sought	the	shelter	of	the	 <i class="calibre4">Saint</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Pierre</i>,	of	course—at	least,	so	we	thought! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a>“‘Who	 goes	 there?’	 shouted	 out	 Captain	 Alphonse,	 who	 was	 standing alone	with	me,	close	to	the	taffrail.	‘Poor	devils!	there	is	probably	another</p>
<p class="calibre1">insurrection	at	Port	au	Prince,	and	President	Salomon	up	or	down	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 is	 always	 one	 or	 the	 other	 every	 year	 or	 so,	 and	 these	 poor	 fellows may	be	flying	to	save	their	miserable	necks.	Who	goes	there?	Who	goes</p>
<p class="calibre1">there?’	 But,	 whether	 wanting	 all	 their	 energy	 for	 their	 oars	 or	 for	 some other	 reason	 known	 to	 themselves,	 those	 in	 the	 boat	 made	 no	 reply	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	 hail,	 and	 the	 next	 moment,	 ere	 the	 ship	 gathered	 way	 sufficient	 to gain	 on	 them,	 they	 were	 alongside,	 their	 long	 unwieldy	 craft	 grating</p>
<p class="calibre1">against	the	ship’s	timbers	beneath	her	counter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Look-out	 there,	 forrads!’	 cried	 Captain	 Alphonse,	 seeing	 the	 boat</p>
<p class="calibre1">making	 apparently	 for	 our	 bows,	 but	 before	 a	 hand	 could	 be	 raised	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">prevent	 them,	 without	 asking	 permission	 in	 any	 way	 or	 offering	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">slightest	 apology	 or	 excuse	 in	 advance	 for	 their	 conduct,	 a	 number	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">negroes	jumped	out	of	her	and	began	climbing	aboard	the	 <i class="calibre4">Saint	Pierre</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Heavens!	gentlemen,	clad	in	little	beyond	Nature’s	own	covering,	as	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">“A	pretty	kettle	of	fish	that!”	exclaimed	the	skipper,	pitching	the	butt-end	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 cigar	 through	 one	 of	 the	 stern	 ports	 as	 he	 got	 up	 from	 his	 seat	 and began	to	pace	up	and	down	the	saloon	in	his	usual	quarter-deck	fashion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 must	 have	 been	 mad,	 colonel,	 to	 let	 them	 come	 aboard	 so	 quietly</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Stay,	 you	 have	 not	 heard	 all,”	 said	 the	 other.	 “As	 the	 black	 rascals tumbled	 over	 the	 side,	 one	 of	 them	 called	 out	 something	 in	 the	 French tongue.	This,	sir,	at	once	disarmed	Captain	Alphonse,	who	had	prevented</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	 from	 teaching	 them	 good	 manners,	 which	 I	 otherwise	 should	 have</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a>always	prepared	for	any	such	little	unpleasantness	by	my	experiences	in Venezuela,	where	a	man	often	carries	his	life	in	his	own	hands! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	Captain	Alphonse	would	not	let	me	fire,	though,	by	heavens!	I	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 accounted	 for	 half	 a	 dozen	 of	 them,	 I	 know,	 before	 they	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">advanced	beyond	the	precincts	of	the	ship! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘No,	 no,	 be	 quiet!’	 cried	 he,	 knocking	 my	 arm	 up	 to	 prevent	 my	 taking aim	 at	 the	 leader	 of	 the	 gang,	 whom	 I	 had	 spotted	 dead	 in	 the	 eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘These	are	my	countrymen!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	no	use	my	talking	after	that,	sir.	The	sound	of	the	French	tongue, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which	these	blacks	of	Hayti	speak	with	a	better	accent	than	the	gamins	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Paris,	 gained	 over	 Captain	 Alphonse;	 while	 Madame	 Boisson	 declared</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 whole	 episode	 truly	 charming,	 her	 fat	 husband,	 who	 was	 entirely</p>

<p class="calibre1">ringleader,	 a	 plausible	 scoundrel	 who	 described	 himself	 as	 the	 ‘Marquis</p>

<p class="calibre1">black	peerage	of	Hayti,	to	which	I	did	not	give	heed	at	the	time,	beyond	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	own	mind	thinking	it	ridiculous	and	that	it	was	probably	a	name	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	for	the	occasion,	this	man	came	up	to	Captain	Alphonse	with	a	smile</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 his	 black	 face	 and	 told	 a	 wonderful	 story	 which	 he	 had	 calculated</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	excite	our	pity	while	allaying	our	fears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	had	been	another	revolution	at	Port	au	Prince,	he	said,	as	Captain</p>
<p class="calibre1">Alphonse	had	surmised.	A	band	of	patriots,	of	whom	he,	the	speaker,	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	honour	to	be	the	chief,	had	attempted	to	depose	the	reigning	despot</p>
<p class="calibre1">Salomon	 from	 his	 post	 of	 president,	 but	 that	 that	 astute	 gentleman	 got wind	of	the	conspiracy	in	time,	and	as	he	had	a	very	efficacious	mode	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">quickly	dealing	with	those	opposed	to	him	in	political	matters,	the	nigger</p>
<p class="calibre1">marquis	and	his	fellow-plotters	thought	it	best	to	seek	refuge	in	flight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Salomon,	of	course,	at	once	despatched	his	myrmidons	after	them,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">having	 a	 few	 hours’	 start	 of	 the	 pursuers	 the	 runaway	 revolutionists</p>
<p class="calibre1">contrived	 to	 clear	 off	 from	 Port	 au	 Prince,	 concealing	 themselves	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>mountain	fastnesses	at	the	eastern	end	of	the	island. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here,	 while	 in	 hiding,	 they	 saw	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Saint	 Pierre</i>	 rounding	 Cape	 San Engaño.	Subsequently	observing	that	she	was	becalmed,	they	waited	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">nightfall,	 when	 they	 stole	 a	 boat	 that	 lay	 on	 the	 shore	 and	 pulled	 out towards	our	ship,	just	avoiding	capture	in	the	nick	of	time;	the	regiment	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">black	soldiers	Salomon	had	sent	after	them	having	hit	upon	their	trail	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	so	close	up	behind	that	they	were	able	to	open	fire	on	them	ere	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">boat	 got	 into	 deep	 water,	 two	 of	 the	 fugitive	 patriots	 being	 struck	 by	 the bullets	that	came	whistling	in	their	rear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 ‘marquis’	 was	 of	 the	 belief	 that	 we	 were	 bound	 for	 Cuba,	 so	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">declared	 at	 all	 events	 at	 the	 moment,	 and	 he	 asked	 Captain	 Alphonse</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 the	 utmost	 indifference	 to	 give	 him	 and	 his	 companions	 a	 passage</p>
<p class="calibre1">thither,	assuring	him	that	he	would	be	handsomely	rewarded	for	so	doing</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	some	of	their	friends	belonging	to	the	Haytian	revolutionary	party,	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	established	their	headquarters	at	Havana. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	 reply	 to	 this	 request	 Captain	 Alphonse	 declared	 he	 was	 ‘desolated,’</p>
<p class="calibre1">but	that,	unfortunately,	the	 <i class="calibre4">Saint	Pierre</i>	was	bound	for	Europe	and	not	to the	greater	Antilles;	but,	strange	to	say,	for	I	was	watching	him	keenly	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">while,	our	friend	the	‘marquis’	did	not	appear	either	surprised	or	dismayed</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	his	supposition	as	to	our	destination	turning	out	to	be	so	erroneous,	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	would	have	been,	so	I	thought,	had	he	been	speaking	the	truth	in	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">original	narrative	and	acting	in	good	faith	towards	us! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“From	 that	 moment,	 sir,	 something	 in	 my	 mind	 seemed	 to	 warn	 me</p>
<p class="calibre1">against	 the	 black	 villain,	 though	 I	 had	 been	 previously	 rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">prepossessed	 in	 his	 favour	 by	 his	 manner	 and	 bearing,	 in	 spite	 of	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">strong	antipathy	to	republicans	of	his	complexion!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	 colonel,”	 whispered	 the	 skipper.	 “I	 suppose	 it	 comes	 from	 living</p>
<p class="calibre1">amongst	them	too	much,	but	I	see	you	don’t	like	negroes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No;	you	mistake	my	meaning	greatly	if	you	think	that,	Señor	Applegarth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black,	 white	 or	 yellow,	 the	 colour	 makes	 no	 difference	 to	 me,	 providing the	individual	I	may	have	to	deal	with	be	a	man	in	the	true	sense	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">word!	 In	 the	 old	 days,	 before	 our	 war,	 I	 had	 a	 good	 deal	 to	 do	 with niggers,	for	my	father	and	his	father	before	him	owned	a	large	plantation</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a>in	 Louisiana,	 and	 long	 before	 President	 Lincoln	 issued	 his	 proclamation of	emancipation	every	hand	on	our	estate	was	a	free	man;	so,	you	see, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sir,	 I	 do	 not	 advocate	 slavery	 at	 all	 events.	 But	 between	 slavery	 and unbridled	liberty	there	is,	Señor	Applegarth,	a	wide	margin;	and	though	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	 not	 look	 upon	 a	 nigger	 in	 the	 abstract	 as	 either	 a	 brute	 beast	 or	 a human	 chattel,	 still	 I	 do	 not	 consider	 him	 quite	 fit	 to	 govern	 himself,	 nor do	I	regard	him	in	the	light	of	my	brother,	sir,	nor	even	as	my	equal	in	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">way!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	skipper	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘What’s	bred	in	the	bone,’	colonel—you	know	the	rest!”	said	he.	“Your	old</p>
<p class="calibre1">experience	in	the	Southern	States	prejudices	you	against	the	race.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pardon	me,”	rejoined	Colonel	Vereker	warmly,	“I	don’t	dislike	them	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	contrary,	I	have	found	some	negroes	more	faithful	than	any	white</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	 of	 my	 acquaintance,	 being	 true	 to	 the	 death;	 and	 I	 know	 that	 if	 I came	 across,	 to-morrow,	 any	 of	 the	 old	 hands	 on	 our	 Louisianian</p>
<p class="calibre1">plantation	whom	my	father	made	free,	I	should	be	as	glad	to	see	them	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	would	be	to	meet	me.	But,	sir,	at	the	same	time,	allowing	all	this,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">cannot	 admit	 the	 negro	 to	 be	 on	 an	 equality	 with	 the	 white	 races.	 They are	inferior,	I	am	certain,	alike	in	intelligence,	disposition	and	nature,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	hold	him	as	little	qualified	for	self-government	on	the	European	system</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	a	child	is	fit	to	be	entrusted	with	a	case	of	razors	for	playthings.	Hayti</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	an	illustration	of	this,	sir!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	my	dear	sir,”	said	the	skipper	good-humouredly,	glad	to	see	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">colonel	 taken	 out	 of	 himself	 and	 forgetting	 his	 grief	 about	 his	 little daughter	 for	 the	 moment	 in	 the	 discussion.	 “Carry	 on;	 we’re	 listening	 to you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	enthusiasm,	however,	did	not	last	very	long. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Heavens!	Señor	Applegarth,	and	you,	too,	gentlemen,”	he	went	on	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">changed	tone.	“I	have	cause	to	love	those	Haytian	scoundrels	well,	I	tell</p>
<p class="calibre1">you!	Well,	sirs,	to	proceed	with	my	story,	the	terrible	end	of	which	I	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">nearly	reached,	this	dog	of	a	black	rascal,	the	so-called	marquis,	seemed</p>
<p class="calibre1">quite	content,	much	to	my	surprise,	when	Captain	Alphonse	told	him	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	not	bound	for	Cuba,	but	for	Liverpool. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a>“It	 was	 all	 the	 same	 to	 him,	 he	 said,	 and	 as	 they	 were	 going	 the	 longer voyage,	perhaps	Captain	Alphonse	would	allow	him	and	his	companions</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 work	 out	 their	 passage	 by	 assisting	 the	 crew	 in	 the	 navigation	 of	 the ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain	 Alphonse	 was	 delighted	 at	 this,	 for	 we	 had	 only	 half	 a	 dozen good	 seamen	 on	 board,	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 hands	 being	 a	 lot	 of	 half-bred mulattoes	 and	 niggers—some	 of	 the	 scourings	 of	 South	 America	 whom</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 had	 picked	 up	 at	 La	 Guayra,	 most	 of	 whom	 knew	 how	 to	 handle	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">cutlass	 better	 than	 a	 rope—so	 the	 proposed	 addition	 to	 the	 strength	 of our	 ship’s	 company	 was	 a	 very	 acceptable	 one,	 particularly	 as	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Marquis’	pointed	out	two	of	his	companions	as	being	expert	sailors	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">qualified	pilots	and	navigators.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ha!	You	kept	your	eye	on	those	gentry,	colonel,	I	bet	you	did?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 sir.	 They	 were	 the	 first	 I	 spotted	 when	 the	 row	 began;	 but	 I’m anticipating	matters.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 divvle	 a	 bit,	 sor,”	 interposed	 Garry	 O’Neil.	 “Let	 me	 jist	 change	 the dressin’	of	your	leg,	an’	ye	can	polish	off	the	rist	of	the	rascals	as	soon	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">ye	plaize.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	thousand	thanks,”	returned	the	other,	shifting	his	position	to	allow	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">leg	 to	 be	 attended	 to.	 “They	 did	 not	 disclose	 their	 purpose,	 though,	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘show	 their	 hand,’	 as	 they	 say	 at	 the	 game	 of	 monte,	 all	 at	 once;	 for, moved	 by	 their	 voluntary	 offer	 to	 help	 work	 the	 ship,	 Captain	 Alphonse promised	the	‘marquis,’	who	when	making	this	offer	had	urged	a	request</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 that	 effect,	 calculating	 on	 the	 captain’s	 generosity	 to	 put	 in	 and	 leave the	lot	at	Bermuda,	should	they	make	a	fair	passage	up	to	the	parallel	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 island,	 but	 in	 the	 event	 of	 their	 being	 delayed	 by	 foul	 winds	 or	 the voyage	 appearing	 as	 if	 it	 must	 be	 a	 long	 one,	 the	 Haytians	 must	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">contented	to	cross	the	ocean. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	bargain	was	struck	at	once,	this	proviso	being	accepted	with	alacrity</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 it	 just	 suited	 their	 purpose,	 and	 never	 saw	 I	 men	 work	 as	 those</p>
<p class="calibre1">Haytians	 worked	 in	 the	 way	 of	 tumbling	 up	 at	 all	 hours	 and	 pulling	 and hauling,	shaking	out	reefs	and	setting	fresh	sail,	the	next	day	or	two	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 weather	 was	 contrary,	 and	 we	 had	 to	 tack	 about	 a	 good	 deal	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>windward	in	getting	out	into	the	open	Atlantic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Heavens!	How	they	exerted	themselves;	so	much	so	that	I	quite	shared</p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Alphonse’s	admiration	for	them,	but,	unlike	him,	I	watched	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I	noticed	that	they	and	the	coloured	men	of	our	crew	who	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">picked	 up	 at	 La	 Guayra	 seemed	 on	 a	 more	 friendly	 footing	 than	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">altogether	warranted	by	the	short	time	they	had	been	on	board.	Captain</p>
<p class="calibre1">Alphonse	and	the	other	passengers,	however,	would	not	see	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,	sir,	I	had	an	old	negro	servant	on	board	with	me,	who	had	followed</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 fortunes	 from	 the	 States	 to	 Venezuela	 after	 the	 war,	 Louisiana	 then being	 no	 longer	 a	 fit	 place	 for	 a	 white	 man	 to	 live	 in.	 Poor	 old	 Cato;	 he was	the	most	faithful	soul	the	Almighty	ever	put	breath	into! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Him	 I	 acquainted	 with	 my	 suspicions,	 and	 sent	 amongst	 the	 blacks,	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">gather	 what	 information	 he	 could	 of	 their	 designs,	 for	 I	 was	 confident, sirs,	they	had	not	boarded	us	for	nothing,	and	were	hatching	some	deep</p>
<p class="calibre1">plot	with	a	view,	very	probably,	of	getting	possession	of	our	ship	in	order</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	better	to	further	the	interests	of	the	revolutionary	party	to	which	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">belonged	that	was	opposed	to	Salomon,	the	president	in	power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whatever	their	object	might	be,	however,	I	distrusted	them	in	every	way, </p>
<p class="calibre1">believing	them,	indeed,	actuated	by	other	motives	than	such	as	might	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">prompted	by	their	political	aspirations,	my	suspicions	being	confirmed	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	looks	and	bearing	of	the	gang,	who	seemed	capable	of	any	atrocity, </p>
<p class="calibre1">judging	 them	 by	 their	 villainous	 faces	 and	 generally	 hang-dog</p>
<p class="calibre1">appearance,	 besides	 which	 they	 were	 continually	 whispering	 together</p>
<p class="calibre1">amongst	 themselves	 and	 consorting	 and	 confabbing	 with	 the	 mulattoes</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	other	coloured	men	belonging	to	the	crew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	addition	to	that,	Señor	Applegarth,	and	you	too,	gentlemen,	I	noticed</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 our	 friend	 ‘the	 marquis,’	 although	 he	 gave	 himself	 great	 airs	 on</p>
<p class="calibre1">account	 of	 the	 aristocratic	 blood	 and	 descent	 to	 which	 he	 lay	 claim, </p>
<p class="calibre1">pretending	 to	 think	 himself	 much	 superior	 in	 position	 to	 both	 Captain</p>
<p class="calibre1">Alphonse	and	myself,	and	regarding	poor	Cato,	my	servant,	as	mere	dirt</p>
<p class="calibre1">under	his	feet,	albeit	the	faithful	negro	was	of	a	like	colour	to	himself—did</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The	Seventh	of	November. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	faithful	negro,	however,”	continued	the	colonel,	pausing	at	this	point</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	puff	out	another	cloud	of	smoke	from	his	fragrant	cigar,—“well,	he	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">unable	to	learn	anything	of	the	Haytians,	though	he	tried	to	make	friends</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 them,	 for	 they	 always	 stopped	 their	 talk	 amongst	 themselves	 on	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">approach,	 and	 would	 only	 reply	 to	 his	 overtures	 in	 monosyllables</p>
<p class="calibre1">expressive	 of	 distrust,	 accompanied	 by	 contemptuous	 gestures	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">angered	poor	Cato	greatly,	for	as	he	considered	that	he	belonged	to	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	felt	the	insult	to	be	directed	not	only	at	himself	but	at	the	whole	family. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Golly,	massa!’	he	said	to	me	after	a	couple	or	so	of	attempts	that	proved</p>
<p class="calibre1">fruitless	 to	 ingratiate	 himself	 into	 the	 confidence	 of	 the	 gang,	 ‘you	 just wait;	 I	 catch	 dem	 black	 raskils	 nappin’	 by-an’-bye,	 you	 see,	 massa.	 You see,	“speshly	dat	tarn	markiss!”’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	managed	this	sooner	than	he	thought,	and	pretty	smartly	too,	for	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">aversion,	walking	off	with	a	pair	of	pistols	from	Captain	Alphonse’s	cabin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 Cato	 coming	 up	 and	 stopping	 him	 in	 the	 very	 act,	 the	 ‘marquis’	 put down	 the	 pistols	 quickly,	 saying	 in	 his	 off-hand	 manner	 that	 he	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">merely	 examining	 the	 locks,	 remarking	 how	 well	 they	 were	 made.	 ‘But,’</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	Cato,	‘guess	he	no	bamboozle	dis	chile!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 following	 day,	 sirs,	 was	 the	 seventh	 of	 November,	 last	 Friday,	 that awful,	that	terrible	day! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cato,	who	had	been	away	forward	early	in	the	morning	to	see	about	our</p>

<p class="calibre1">“‘Yay,	 massa,’	 said	 he,	 ‘guess	 dose	 tam	 niggars	 up	 to	 sumfin’!	 I’se	 hear um	say	dey	smell	de	lan’	an’	de	time	was	’rive	to	settle	de	white	trash,	dat</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Of	 course	 on	 hearing	 this	 I	 put	 Captain	 Alphonse	 immediately	 on	 his</p>

<p class="calibre1">pistols,	 which	 we	 served	 out	 to	 the	 two	 mates	 and	 the	 boatswain,	 all	 of whom	 were	 good	 men	 and	 brave	 Frenchmen.	 Monsieur	 Boisson,	 when</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Jingo!	 The	 emergency	 we	 dreaded	 came	 soon	 enough,	 sir;	 indeed, </p>

<p class="calibre1">“It	 was	 just	 after	 the	 noontide	 hour,	 I	 recollect	 that	 well,	 for	 Captain Alphonse	had	just	taken	the	altitude	of	the	sun	to	ascertain	our	position, </p>
<p class="calibre1">when,	 as	 he	 came	 up	 from	 his	 cabin	 where	 he	 had	 gone	 to	 consult	 his chronometers	and	work	out	‘the	reckoning,’	as	you	sailors	call	it,	that	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">black	devil	the	‘marquis’	mounted	the	poop	with	a	simpering	and	fawning</p>
<p class="calibre1">air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Ah	well,	captain,’	said	he,	with	a	very	polite	bow,	‘where	do	you	make	us</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	to	be,	monsieur?	Near	the	Bermudas	yet?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘My	word,	yes,’	replied	Captain	Alphonse.	‘We	are	some	ten	leagues	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	the	westward	of	the	islands,	but	we’re	bearing	up	now,	as	you	see,	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">reach	them.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘And	 what	 time,	 monsieur,’	 said	 the	 ‘marquis,’	 speaking	 louder	 so	 that some	of	the	other	niggers	who	were	on	the	deck	below	could	hear	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	said.	‘Do	you	think	it	will	be	possible	for	us	to	land?	My	companions</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	myself,	monsieur,	as	you	can	well	imagine,	are	most	anxious	to	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">ashore	as	soon	as	possible,	so	that	we	may	procure	a	ship	to	take	us	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	Havana.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘But,	 yes,	 your	 anxiety	 is	 natural	 enough,’	 responded	 poor	 Captain</p>
<p class="calibre1">Alphonse,	suspecting	nothing	from	this.	‘I	hope	to	approach	near	enough</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	Port	Saint	George	to	put	you	ashore	some	time	in	the	afternoon.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a>“‘ <i class="calibre4">Ohe</i>,	below	there!’	cried	out	the	Haytian	in	reply	to	this,	addressing	his companions	 in	 the	 waist,	 who,	 I	 noticed,	 were	 gradually	 edging</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves	 more	 and	 more	 aft.	 ‘Do	 you	 hear	 that,	 my	 brave	 boys?	 We</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	going	to	land	at	last.	Get	the	boat	ready!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 was	 evidently	 a	 signal,	 for	 he	 shouted	 out	 the	 last	 words	 in	 a	 still higher	key	than	that	in	which	he	had	been	speaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘You	need	not	hurry,	my	friend!’	said	the	captain,	surprised	at	this	order</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 smiling	 at	 the	 Haytian’s	 impulsiveness,	 as	 he	 thought	 it.	 ‘There	 will be	plenty	of	time	for	lowering	the	boat	when	we	come	in	sight	of	land.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘I	think	differently,	monsieur,’	rejoined	the	other,	scowling	and	assuming</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	arrogant	tone	for	the	first	time.	‘I	say	the	time	is	 <i class="calibre4">Now</i>!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	he	yelled	out	at	the	top	of	his	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Instantly	 the	 gang	 of	 blacks	 made	 a	 rush	 at	 the	 poop	 on	 both	 sides	 at once,	and	Captain	Alphonse	clutched	at	his	revolver,	which	he	had	in	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">pocket,	but	was	unable	to	get	it	out	in	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mine,	however,	was	in	my	hand	and	ready	cocked.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Houly	 Moses!”	 ejaculated	 Garry	 O’Neil,	 his	 Irish	 blood	 making	 him	 all</p>
<p class="calibre1">attention	 now	 at	 the	 mere	 mention	 of	 fighting.	 “I	 hope	 ye	 let	 ’em	 have	 it hot,	sor! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Guess	I	did!”	replied	Colonel	Vereker	grimly,	dropping	unconsciously	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 native	 vernacular,	 which	 up	 to	 now	 he	 had	 almost	 seemed	 to	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">forgotten	 from	 his	 long	 residence	 amongst	 a	 Spanish-speaking	 race. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	may	bet	your	bottom	dollar	on	that,	sir!	I	aimed	at	that	scoundrel	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘marquis,’	 but	 he	 jumped	 backward	 in	 his	 fright	 and	 his	 foot	 catching	 in one	 of	 the	 ringbolts,	 he	 tumbled	 right	 over	 the	 poop-rail	 on	 to	 the	 deck below;	 the	 shot	 I	 had	 intended	 for	 him	 dropping	 the	 black	 pilot,	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">constant	 companion,	 and	 who	 was	 invariably	 behind	 him.  <i class="calibre4">He</i>	 dropped down	as	dead	as	a	herring! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don	Miguel,	who	luckily	had	just	come	up	from	the	saloon,	being	handy</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	his	revolver	from	the	rough	times	he	had	experienced,	like	myself,	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Venezuela,	 settled	 another	 darkie;	 while	 little	 Johnson,	 the	 Englishman, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a>caught	 up	 a	 long	 hand-spike,	 bigger	 than	 himself,	 and	 with	 it	 knocked down	two	of	the	Haytians	to	his	own	cheek. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Madame	 Boisson,	 meanwhile,	 was	 screaming	 for	 her	 husband,	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">brave	 Hercules,	 to	 come	 to	 the	 rescue;	 but	 the	 ‘brave	 Hercules’	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">locked	 himself	 in	 his	 cabin,	 as	 my	 little	 Elsie	 told	 me	 afterwards;	 for fortunately	 the	 poor	 child	 was	 not	 feeling	 well	 and	 I	 had	 desired	 her	 to remain	below	during	the	hot	noontide	heat	of	the	sun;	and,	she	also	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	could	hear	him	crying	and	sobbing	and	calling	down	imprecations	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">everybody,	 including	 ‘my	 wife’	 and	 himself	 for	 both	 being	 in	 such	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">position,	Madame	Boisson	hammering	at	the	door	all	the	time,	and,	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">finding	he	would	not	reopen	to	her	appeal	for	help,	apostrophising	him	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	coward!	a	pig! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“During	 this	 time	 we	 were	 pretty	 busy	 on	 deck,	 the	 second	 mate, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Basseterre,	 and	 another	 French	 seaman,	 who	 was	 with	 him	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">crossjack	 yard,	 having	 come	 down	 from	 aloft	 to	 our	 assistance.	 Captain</p>
<p class="calibre1">Alphonse	got	his	revolver	out,	when	he	and	Don	Miguel	and	I	giving	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	volley	altogether,	and	the	others	supporting	us	with	what	weapons	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">had,	we	rushed	the	rascals	off	the	poop	quicker	than	they	came	up,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lot	 returning	 to	 the	 forecastle	 along	 with	 the	 ‘marquis,’	 who,	 I	 was	 very glad	to	see,	had	cut	his	face	considerably	by	his	tumble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain	Alphonse	thereupon,	seeing	the	coast	clear,	sang	out	for	Housi, </p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 second	 officer,	 and	 the	 boatswain,	 who	 he	 thought	 were	 away</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward,	to	come	up	aft	and	join	us,	so	that	we	might	all	be	together,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">instead	of	these	men,	Cato,	my	own	black	servant	ran	up	the	poop-ladder</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	told	us	in	much	trepidation	that	Monsieur	Housi,	with	the	boatswain</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rigault	 and	 one	 of	 the	 French	 sailors,	 were	 imprisoned	 in	 the	 forepeak, while	 the	 two	 white	 sailors	 and	 the	 steward	 were	 hard	 and	 fast	 in	 the main	 hold,	 whither	 they	 had	 descended	 to	 get	 some	 provisions,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mutineers	 slipping	 on	 the	 hatchway	 cover	 over	 them,	 on	 the	 ‘marquis,’</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	devil,	giving	the	signal!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	my	poor	fellows!”	cried	Captain	Alphonse.	“That,	then,	means	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	only	ourselves	left.	Good	heavens!	What	shall	we	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why,	 hoist	 a	 signal	 of	 distress,”	 I	 suggested	 at	 once.	 “We	 are	 near</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bermuda,	on	the	cruising	ground	of	the	English	men-of-war;	and	as	these</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>scoundrels	have	no	friends	or	assistance,	I	daresay	we’ll	be	able	to	hold out	here	until	some	vessel	bears	up	to	our	aid!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Good,	 my	 friend,’	 replied	 Captain	 Alphonse,	 who	 with	 Basseterre,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">second	 mate,	 and	 Don	 Miguel,	 remained	 to	 keep	 guard	 with	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1">revolvers,	 both	 seated	 on	 top	 of	 the	 skylight	 hatchway,	 which</p>
<p class="calibre1">commanded	 the	 approaches	 to	 the	 poop	 by	 way	 of	 the	 ladders,	 while	 I, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 the	 last	 of	 the	 white	 sailors,	 ran	 aft.	 Then	 I	 called	 out,	 ‘Hoist	 the French	flag!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	knew	that	the	locker	with	the	flags	was	in	the	wheel-house,	close	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">taffrail,	 and	 there	 being	 no	 one	 to	 interfere	 with	 us,	 the	 negro	 who	 had been	 attending	 the	 helm	 having	 bolted	 the	 moment	 I	 pulled	 out	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">revolver	at	the	first	alarm,	the	traitor	flying	to	join	the	other	mutineers,	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">sailor	and	I	soon	ferretted	out	an	old	ensign,	the	Tricolour;	when,	binding</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 on	 to	 the	 signal	 halliards,	 we	 hoisted	 it	 about	 half-way	 up	 the	 peak	 of our	spanker,	whence	it	could	best	be	seen	by	a	passing	ship.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	know	what	that	signal	meant,	colonel?”	said	Captain	Applegarth</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	an	inquiring	tone,	“that	you	had	a	death	aboard,	eh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Si,	 señor.	 Oh	 yes,	 of	 course,”	 repeated	 the	 colonel,	 correcting	 himself almost	as	soon	as	he	spoke	for	his	lapse	again	into	the	Spanish	tongue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	 were	 half	 a	 dozen	 dead	 Haytians	 there,	 whom,	 by	 the	 way, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Alphonse	and	I	presently	pitched	over	the	side!	But,	beyond	that, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sir,	I	believe	all	sailors	regard	a	flag	hoisted	in	that	way,	‘half-mast	high,’</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	it	is	termed,	to	be	a	signal	of	distress! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Without	 doubt,	 sir,”	 answered	 the	 skipper.	 “I	 was	 only	 testing	 your</p>
<p class="calibre1">nautical	experience,	that’s	all!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	glad	then,	I	did	not	make	a	blunder	about	it,	as	I	thought	I	had	done</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 your	 question,”	 returned	 Colonel	 Vereker,	 quite	 seriously,	 not</p>
<p class="calibre1">noticing	that	the	skipper	was	only	poking	fun	at	him	in	his	way	and	did	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">mean	anything	beyond	a	bit	of	chaff.	“Well,	sir,	after	hoisting	the	flag	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">French	sailor	and	I	seized	the	opportunity	to	lash	the	helm	amidships	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	to	keep	the	 <i class="calibre4">Saint	Pierre</i>	on	her	course,	for	we	could	not	spare	him	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	 the	 steering,	 and	 Captain	 Alphonse	 and	 Don	 Miguel,	 with	 the	 plucky</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	 Englishman	 and	 myself,	 had	 all	 our	 work	 to	 do	 watching	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a>mutineers	with	our	revolvers! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“After	a	time,	as	the	rascals	kept	pretty	quiet	in	their	part	of	the	ship,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	my	poor	little	daughter	Elsie	had	been	a	long	time	now	shut	up	below, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	she	might	come	up	on	the	poop	to	get	a	breath	of	fresh	air	while</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 was	 still	 light;	 there	 being	 no	 fear	 of	 the	 blacks	 assailing	 us	 again	 so long	as	they	knew	we	could	see	to	shoot	straight	and	had	our	weapons</p>
<p class="calibre1">handy! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	 I	 sent	 Cato	 down	 to	 fetch	 her	 on	 deck,	 and	 she	 came	 up	 the	 next moment,	all	full	of	curiosity	and	alarm,	as	you	may	imagine,	the	little	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">wanting	 to	 know	 what	 had	 occurred;	 for	 the	 reports	 of	 my	 revolver	 and the	 subsequent	 stillness	 had	 occasioned	 her	 great	 fright,	 Madame</p>
<p class="calibre1">Boisson	 and	 her	 husband,	 the	 ‘brave	 Hercules,’	 being	 but	 poor</p>
<p class="calibre1">comforters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	at	once,	while	I	was	explaining	to	her	about	the	flag,	telling	her	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	had	hoisted	it	in	order	to	summon	any	passing	ship	to	our	assistance, </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	suddenly	went	to	the	side	and	looked	over	the	bulwarks	towards	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">north. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	next	moment	she	gave	vent	to	a	cry	of	joy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Oh,	my	father,’	she	suddenly	exclaimed.	‘You	have	only	just	hoisted	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">flag	in	time.	There’s	a	big	steamer!	Look,	look!	there	it	is,	and	coming	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	help	us!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Where?	 where?	 Where	 is	 it?	 I	 cannot	 see	 it.	 Nonsense,	 Elsie;	 you	 are dreaming,	my	child!’	I	said,	looking	out	eagerly	to	where	she	pointed,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	see	nothing.	‘There’s	no	ship	there,	little	one!’	and	I	felt	angry	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">false	alarm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘But,	my	father,	you	are	wrong,’	still	insisted	the	child,	as	positive	as	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">please.	‘I	can	see	the	vessel	there	in	the	distance	quite	plainly.	See	how</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	black	smoke	comes	puffing	out	of	the	chimneys.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	laughed	at	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Little	darling,’	said	I,	‘there	was	no	ship,	and	there	are	no	“chimneys”	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">board	ships	at	sea.	Sailors	call	them	funnels,	my	dearest	one.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>“She	pretended	to	pout	on	my	thus	catching	her	tripping	in	her	talk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Well,	my	father,’	said	she,	with	a	shrug	of	her	shoulders,	as	is	her	habit</p>
<p class="calibre1">sometimes,	 ‘I	 may	 be	 wrong	 about	 the	 chimneys,	 but	 I	 am	 not	 wrong</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	seeing	a	ship.	Why,	my	father,	there	she	is	now,	coming	closer	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">closer,	and	quite	near;	so	near	that	I	can	see—yes,	I	can	see—I	am	quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">sure—a	big	boy	there.	Look,	look,	father,	dear!	There	he	is	in	front	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">smoke.	He	has	quite	a	pleasant	face.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Elsie	turned	in	my	direction	as	she	spoke,	and,	though	I	was	still	gazing</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	 the	 while,	 I	 could	 see	 nothing,	 and	 I	 was	 vexed,	 very	 vexed	 with	 my little	girl	for	her	persistency	in	the	matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Why,	it	has	gone—quite	disappeared!’	she	cried	out	the	instant	after,	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">rushing	 to	 the	 side	 and	 looking	 over.	 ‘What	 does	 it	 mean?	 Why	 did	 she not	come	and	help	if	she	saw	the	flag?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘You	have	dreamt	it,	little	one,’	I	replied	shortly,	as	I	had	done	before.	‘It’s a	freak	of	the	imagination,	and	you	fancied	it,	you	funny	little	woman.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	it	was	a	curious	incident,	though,	sir,	was	it	not,	at	such	a	time,	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	hearts	all	full	of	expectancy	and	hope?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	 Applegarth	 was	 greatly	 excited	 by	 the	 narrative,	 and	 so,	 it	 may readily	be	believed,	was	I. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	asked	abruptly,	“When	did	this	happen?	Tell	me,	colonel,	at	once.	It	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">strange—very	so!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 other	 looked	 up	 with	 surprise,	 while	 Mr	 Stokes	 stared	 at	 him	 with wonder,	and	the	Irishman	opened	his	big	blue	eyes	wide	to	the	full. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 have	 already	 told	 you,	 sir,”	 replied	 Colonel	 Vereker	 very	 quickly.	 “As	 I told	you	before,	it	was	the	seventh	of	November—last	Friday.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes;	but	I	mean	what	time	of	the	day,	sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 I	 should	 think	 about	 five	 o’clock	 in	 the	 afternoon.	 Perhaps	 a	 little later,	as	the	sun	was	going	down,	I	recollect,	at	the	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>I	could	not	restrain	my	astonishment	at	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	must	be	the	very	ship	I	saw!”	I	thought	to	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	the	young	lady	slight	in	figure,	and	has	she	long	golden-coloured	hair</p>
<p class="calibre1">hanging	loose	about	her	head,	sir?”	I	eagerly	asked,	almost	breathless	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 excitement.	 “And,	 tell	 me	 too,	 did	 she	 have	 a	 large	 black</p>
<p class="calibre1">Newfoundland	or	retriever	dog	by	her	side	that	same	evening,	sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Colonel	Vereker	seemed	even	more	astonished	by	this	question	of	mine</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	I	had	been	by	his	reply	to	Captain	Applegarth	the	moment	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	brave	young	sir,”	said	he,	using	this	somewhat	grandiloquent	form	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">addressing	 me,	 I	 suppose,	 in	 remembrance	 of	 the	 slight	 service	 I	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">done	him	by	swimming	with	the	line	to	the	drifting	boat	when	we	picked</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	 him	 and	 his	 companion.	 “My	 little	 Elsie	 is	 tall	 and	 slight	 for	 her	 age, and	 her	 hair	 is	 assuredly	 of	 a	 golden	 hue,	 ah,	 yes!	 like	 liquid	 sunshine; though,	how	you,	my	good	young	gentleman,	who,	to	my	knowledge,	can</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">never</i>	have	seen	her	face	to	face	in	this	life,	can	know	the	colour	of	her hair	or	what	she	is	like,	I	must	confess	that	passes	my	comprehension!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	the	dog,	sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 is	 stranger	 still,”	 remarked	 Colonel	 Vereker.	 “I	 had	 forgotten	 to mention	 that	 I	 brought	 with	 me	 on	 board	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Saint	 Pierre</i>	 from	 my	 old home	at	Caracas	a	splendid	Russian	wolf-hound,	as	faithful	a	creature	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	poor	negro	servant	Cato.	His	name	is	Ivan,	and	he	is	now,	I	sincerely</p>
<p class="calibre1">hope	 and	 trust,	 guarding	 my	 little	 darling	 girl,	 as	 I	 would	 have	 done	 if	 I had	remained	with	her,	for	not	a	living	soul	would	dare	to	touch	her	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	there.	Ivan	would	tear	them	limb	from	limb	first.	He	is	a	large	greyish-</p>
<p class="calibre1">black	dog,	with	a	rough	shaggy	coat,	and	in	reply	to	your	enquiry,	I	must</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell	 you	 he	  <i class="calibre4">was</i>	 on	 the	 poop	 of	 the	 ship,	 by	 the	 side	 of	 my	 child,	 at	 the very	time	that	she	declared	she	saw	that	steamer,	which	I,	myself,	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	see	anywhere!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 the	 moment	 I	 was	 unable	 to	 speak.	 I	 was	 so	 overcome	 at	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1">unexpected	 confirmation	 of	 the	 sight	 I	 had	 seen	 on	 that	 eventful	 Friday night,	though	I	had	afterwards	been	inclined	to	disbelieve	the	evidence	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 own	 senses,	 as	 everybody	 else	 had	 done,	 even	 the	 skipper	 at	 last</p>
<p class="calibre1">joining	 in	 with	 the	 opinion	 of	 Mr	 Fosset	 and	 all	 the	 rest,	 save	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>boatswain,	 old	 Masters.	 Yes,	 yes;	 every	 one	 them	 imagined	 that	 I	 had dreamt	 of	 “the	 ghost-ship”	 as	 they	 called	 my	 vision,	 and	 that	 I	 had	 not seen	it	at	all! </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	this	statement	from	the	colonel	absolutely	staggered	the	skipper,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 looked	 from	 me	 to	 the	 American	 and	 back	 again	 at	 me	 in	 the	 most</p>
<p class="calibre1">bewildering	manner	possible;	the	old	chief,	Mr	Stokes,	and	Garry	O’Neil</p>
<p class="calibre1">staring	at	the	pair	of	us	with	equal	amazement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	George,	the	girl	and	the	dog,	the	girl	and	the	dog.	Why,	it’s	the	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">same	ship,	as	you	say,	Haldane;	it	must	be	so,	and,	by	George,	my	boy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you	 were	 right	 after	 all!	 By	 George,	 you	 were!”	 at	 length	 exclaimed	 the skipper	in	a	voice,	the	genuineness	of	whose	astonishment	could	not	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">doubted.	 “Colonel	 Vereker,	 I	 would	 not	 have	 credited	 this	 had	 any	 one</p>
<p class="calibre1">told	it	me	and	sworn	to	the	truth	of	it	on	oath,	but	the	proof	is	so	strong</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	I	cannot	possibly	disbelieve	it,	sir,	though	it	is	to	my	mind	a	downright</p>
<p class="calibre1">impossibility	 according	 to	 every	 argument	 of	 common	 sense.	 It	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">certainly	the	most	wonderful	thing	that	has	ever	happened	to	me,	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">most	wonderful	thing	that	I	have	ever	heard	of	since	I	have	been	at	sea!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Heavens!”	cried	the	other.	“But	why?	You	surprise	me,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	colonel,”	rejoined	the	skipper.	“But	I	am	going	to	surprise	you	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	don’t	laugh	at	me,	and	don’t	think	me	an	idiot	and	gone	off	my	head, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sir,	when	I	tell	you	that	this	lad,	Dick	Haldane,	here,	whether	by	reason	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	 mirage	 or	 other	 I	 cannot	 tell,	 for	 it’s	 beyond	 my	 understanding</p>
<p class="calibre1">altogether,	 distinctly	 saw	 your	 ship	 with	 her	 signal	 of	 distress,	 and	 says he	 saw	 your	 little	 daughter	 with	 the	 dog	 by	 her	 side,	 aboard	 her,	 last Friday	night	at	sunset.	More	than	that,	sir,	he	described	to	me	at	the	time, </p>
<p class="calibre1">exactly	 as	 you	 have	 done	 now,	 colonel,	 everything	 he	 saw,	 even	 to	 the very	hue	of	the	young	girl’s	hair	and	the	colour	and	texture	of	the	dog’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">coat!	It	is	altogether	marvellous	and,	indeed,	incredible!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 but—”	 said	 Colonel	 Vereker	 slowly,	 and	 pausing	 between	 every</p>
<p class="calibre1">word	as	if	trying	to	comprehend	it	all.	“Why,	how	is	that,	sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	ship,	colonel,	must	have	been	more	than	five	hundred	miles	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	ours	at	the	time—that	is	all!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Twenty	One. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Butchered. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dios!”	exclaimed	Colonel	Vereker.	“Are	you—certain	of	this,	sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Applegarth	shrugged	his	shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ask	Mr	Stokes	here	and	your	doctor	there,	Mr	O’Neil,	whether	they	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 hear	 Haldane’s	 yarn	 about	 your	 ship	 five	 days	 ago,	 sir,	 before	 we ever	clapped	eyes	on	you,”	said	he	in	a	slightly	aggrieved	tone,	as	if	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought	 his	 word	 was	 being	 doubted.	 “Why,	 colonel,	 this	 poor	 lad	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">becoming	the	butt	for	everybody’s	chaff	on	board	on	account	of	it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gracious!”	cried	the	other.	“This	is	indeed	really	wonderful!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	colonel,	and	more	than	that!	But	for	the	lad	seeing	this	mirage,	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatever	else	it	was,	and	telling	me	about	it,	we	would	not	have	gone	off</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	 course	 in	 search	 of	 you	 to	 render	 what	 assistance	 we	 could—yours</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	 the	 ‘ship	 in	 distress’	 Haldane	 reported	 having	 sighted	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">southward.	This	divergence	from	our	track,	sir,	took	us	into	the	very	teeth</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 gale	 which	 we	 encountered	 later	 on,	 that	 same	 evening,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">conduced	to	our	breaking	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith,”	put	in	Garry	O’Neil,	“that’s	thrue	for	sure,	sor!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	breakdown	of	ours,	colonel,	led	to	our	drifting	to	the	southward	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 trail	 of	 the	 Gulf	 Stream,”	 continued	 the	 skipper,	 following	 up	 the strange	sequence	of	events	as	they	occurred,	one	by	one.	“Your	ship—</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 real	 ship,	 I	 mean—was	 drifting	 north	 and	 east	 meanwhile,	 carried</p>
<p class="calibre1">along	 by	 the	 same	 current,	 and	 then	 it	 came	 about	 that,	 although</p>
<p class="calibre1">apparently	going	in	opposite	directions	and	acted	on	by	different	causes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">our	tracks	 <i class="calibre4">crossed	each	other	on	the	chart	last	night</i>—at	least,	that	is	my opinion.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 see,	 I	 see,”	 cried	 Colonel	 Vereker	 quickly,	 interrupting	 him,	 and	 in	 a state	of	great	excitement.	“Thank	God!	But	for	that	you	would	never	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">sighted	 our	 drifting	 boat	 and	 picked	 up	 myself	 and	 poor	 Captain</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a>Alphonse!	Thank	God,	Señor	Haldane	saw	us	in	that	mysterious	way.	It seems	 to	 have	 been	 an	 interposition	 of	 heaven	 to	 warn	 you	 of	 our	 peril and	bring	you	to	our	aid!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	 so,	 colonel;	 that’s	 what	 I	 think	 myself	 now,”	 said	 the	 skipper</p>
<p class="calibre1">impressively,	taking	off	his	cap	and	looking	upward	with	a	grave	reflective</p>
<p class="calibre1">air.	“Aye,	and	I	thank	God,	too,	for	putting	us	in	the	way	of	helping	you, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with	all	my	heart,	sir!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah!”	 observed	 old	 Mr	 Stokes,	 who	 had	 remained	 silent	 the	 while.	 “The</p>
<p class="calibre1">ways	of	Providence	are	as	wonderful	as	they	are	mysterious!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 a	 pause	 after	 this	 in	 our	 conversation	 which	 no	 one	 seemed</p>
<p class="calibre1">anxious	to	break	till	Garry	O’Neil	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith,	 sor,	 you	 haven’t	 tould	 us	 yit	 how	 ye	 come	 by	 this	 wound	 in	 your leg,	an’	about	that	poor	chap	in	yander,”	he	said	to	the	colonel,	nodding</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	head	in	the	direction	of	Captain	Applegarth’s	inner	state	cabin,	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	French	captain	was	lying	in	his	cot.	“Sure,	we’re	dyin’	to	hear	the	end</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	your	scrimmage	with	those	black	divvles!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Colonel	Vereker	heaved	a	sigh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 I	 ought	 not	 to	 doubt	 that	 the	 good	 God	 is	 watching	 over	 my	 little, darling	 daughter	 after	 what	 I	 have	 just	 learnt,	 my	 friends,”	 said	 he	 in	 a more	hopeful	tone	than	his	depressed	manner	indicated,	looking	round	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">us	with	his	large,	melancholy,	dark	eyes.	“I	ought	not	to	despair!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly	not,	sir;	I	dare	say	we’ll	soon	overhaul	the	ship	now,	for	we’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	than	an	hour	and	a	half	in	chase	of	her	at	full	speed,”	remarked	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">skipper,	 recovering	 himself	 from	 his	 fit	 of	 abstraction	 and	 looking	 at	 his watch	to	see	the	time.	“Go	on,	colonel;	go	on,	please,	and	tell	us	the	end</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	your	story.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	is	little	more	for	you	to	hear,	sir,”	replied	the	other,	settling	himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	in	his	seat	again,	after	Mr	O’Neil	had	once	more	dressed	the	wound</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	his	leg.	“Before	it	was	dark	that	terrible	night	I	sent	Elsie	below,	while</p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Alphonse	with	myself	stayed	up	on	the	poop	for	the	first	watch, </p>
<p class="calibre1">each	 of	 us	 with	 a	 loaded	 revolver,	 besides	 having	 a	 box	 of	 cartridges handy	 on	 the	 skylight	 near	 by,	 should	 we	 want	 to	 replenish	 our</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a>ammunition.	But	the	Haytians,	sir,	had	evidently	had	enough	of	us	for	that evening,	making	no	further	attempts	to	attack	us	as	the	hours	wore	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	were	as	watchful	as	ourselves,	though,	for	as	Cato,	anon,	trying	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">creep	 forwards	 so	 as	 to	 release	 the	 French	 sailors	 confined	 under	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">main	 hatchway,	 had	 a	 narrow	 escape	 of	 his	 life,	 a	 heavy	 spar	 being</p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly	let	down	by	the	run	almost	on	top	of	his	head	when	he	ventured</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	on	the	exposed	deck.	This	was	at	midnight,	when	the	second	mate, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Basseterre,	 and	 Don	 Miguel,	 with	 the	 French	 sailor	 Duval,	 relieved</p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Alphonse	and	me,	taking	the	middle	watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Next	morning,	however,	soon	after	Captain	Alphonse	and	I,	with	the	little</p>
<p class="calibre1">Englishman,	 had	 resumed	 charge	 of	 the	 poop	 and	 the	 others	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">resting—alas,	 my	 friends,	 without	 my	 knowledge	 or	 sanction,	 poor	 Cato</p>
<p class="calibre1">made	 another	 attempt	 to	 reach	 the	 hatchway,	 which,	 unfortunately</p>
<p class="calibre1">resulted	in	his	death! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hearing	 Ivan	 growl	 and	 my	 little	 daughter	 cry	 out	 as	 if	 something	 had frightened	her,	I	had	gone	down	to	the	cabin	shortly	after	daylight	to	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	 was	 the	 matter,	 cautioning	 Captain	 Alphonse,	 who	 hardly	 needed</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	caution,	not	to	leave	his	post	for	a	moment,	and	not	thinking	of	Cato, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who	had	disappeared	from	the	top	of	the	companion-way	and	had	gone</p>
<p class="calibre1">below	 to	 Elsie—heard	 her	 cry,	 I	 thought,	 and	 gone	 to	 her	 even	 before</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	 was	 not	 in	 the	 cabin,	 however;	 nor	 did	 I	 find	 anything	 much	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter	with	my	child,	who	had	evidently	unconsciously	cried	out	in	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">dream	she	had,	Ivan,	of	course,	gushing	in	sympathy	and	waking	her	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	 telling	 Elsie	 to	 compose	 herself	 and	 go	 off	 to	 sleep	 again,	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything	 was	 going	 on	 all	 right	 and	 there	 was	 nothing	 to	 be	 alarmed about,	 beyond	 the	 snoring	 of	 Monsieur	 and	 Madame	 Boisson	 at	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">further	end	of	the	cabin,	I,	feeling	greatly	relieved,	returned	on	deck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 looked	 round	 for	 Cato	 at	 once,	 naturally,	 for	 our	 forces	 were	 not	 so strong	that	one	would	not	be	missed,	especially	such	a	one	as	he! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	my	faithful	negro	was	nowhere	in	sight!	Captain	Alphonse	said,	too, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	had	not	seen	him	during	my	absence	below,	nor	indeed,	for	some	time</p>
<p class="calibre1">prior	to	my	going	down	to	the	cabin. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a>“I	then	searched	the	wheel-house	aft	without	discovering	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Cato!’	I	called	out,	‘where	are	you?	Come	here	immediately!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	 poor	 servant	 did	 not	 answer,	 but	 that	 black	 fiend,	 the	 pseudo</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘marquis’	advanced	from	the	forepart	of	the	deck,	sheltering	himself,	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">may	be	sure,	from	my	aim	in	the	rear	of	the	windlass	bitts,	which	were	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	line	between	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘You	will	have	to	call	louder,’	he	cried	with	a	mocking	laugh	like	that	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">hyena,	 and	 full	 of	 devilish	 glee.	 ‘I	 assure	 you,	 much	 louder,	 my	 friend, before	that	spy	slave	of	yours	will	ever	be	able	to	answer	you	again!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Heavens!	 I	 feared	 the	 worst	 then.	 Poor	 Cato!	 They	 had	 caught	 him</p>
<p class="calibre1">reconnoitring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘What	 have	 you	 done	 with	 him,	 you	 son	 of	 Satan?’	 I	 yelled	 out,	 full	 of rage	and	anger,	and	with	a	terrible	foreboding.	‘If	you	have	hurt	a	hair	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	head	I	will	make	you	pay	dearly	for	it,	I	can	tell	you,	you	fiend!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 malicious,	 murdering	 wretch	 only	 replied	 to	 my	 threat	 with	 another mocking	laugh,	which	his	companions	echoed,	as	if	enjoying	a	joke,	while</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 noticed	 them	 dragging	 at	 a	 shapeless	 mass	 from	 the	 forecastle</p>
<p class="calibre1">forwards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Kick	the	carrion	aft!’	I	heard	the	inhuman	brute	say	to	his	followers.	‘Let</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	“white	trash”	see	the	dog’s	carcass!	He	will	then	believe	what	I	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">said,	Name	of	God!	and	know	what	is	in	store	for	himself!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	 God!	 Señor	 Applegarth	 and	 you,	 gentlemen,	 I	 can	 hardly	 tell	 you</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	followed.	It	is	all	too	horrible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	sight	of	what	I	saw	will	haunt	me	to	my	grave! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	the	shapeless	mass	I	had	observed	slowly	raised	itself	up	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">deck,	and	I	saw	that	it	was	my	poor	Cato.	The	savages	had	hacked	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">unfortunate	man	to	pieces	with	their	knives! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	recognised	me,	poor	creature,	and	appeared	to	try	to	speak,	but	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">made	 an	 inarticulate	 noise	 between	 a	 sob	 and	 a	 groan	 that	 rings	 in	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a>ears	 now,	 while	 the	 blood	 gushed	 from	 his	 mouth	 as	 he	 fell	 forwards, facing	me,	dead,	huddled	up	in	a	heap	again	upon	the	deck! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Those	 devils	 incarnate,	 besides	 mutilating	 his	 limbs,	 had,	 would	 you</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe	it,	cut	out	his	tongue	as	they	had	before	threatened,	for	warning</p>
<p class="calibre1">us	of	their	treachery!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“God	 in	 heaven!”	 exclaimed	 Captain	 Applegarth,	 stopping	 in	 his	 quick</p>
<p class="calibre1">walk	up	and	down	the	saloon	and	bringing	his	fist	down	on	the	table	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	bang	that	made	the	glasses	in	the	swinging	tray	above	jump	and	rattle, </p>
<p class="calibre1">two	of	them	indeed	falling	over	and	smashing	into	fragments	on	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	infernal	demons!	Can	such	things	be?	It	is	dreadful!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 of	 us	 were	 equally	 horror	 stricken	 and	 indignant	 at	 the	 colonel’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">terrible	recital,	even	old	Mr	Stokes	waking	up	and	stretching	out	his	hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	skipper	as	if	pledging	himself	to	what	he	wished	to	urge	before	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Horrible,	 horrible,	 sir!”	 he	 panted	 out,	 his	 anger	 taking	 away	 his	 breath and	 affecting	 his	 voice.	 “But	 we’ll	 avenge	 the	 poor	 fellow	 and	 kill	 the rascals	when	we	come	up	with	them,	won’t	we,	sir?	There’s	my	hand	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">it,	anyway!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	did	not	and	could	not	say	anything;	no,	I	couldn’t;	but	you	can	pretty	well</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagine	the	oath	I	mentally	registered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	so	Garry	O’Neil,	though. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Irishman’s	face	flamed	with	rage	and	anger.	“Kill	them,	sor!”	cried	he, </p>
<p class="calibre1">springing	 to	 his	 feet	 from	 the	 chair	 in	 which	 he	 had	 been	 seated</p>
<p class="calibre1">alongside	the	colonel,	whose	injured	limb	he	had	been	carefully	attending</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	again	all	the	while,	his	reddish	beard	and	moustache	bristling,	and	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">steel-blue	 eyes	 flashing	 out	 veritable	 sparks,	 it	 seemed	 of	 fire.	 “Faith, killin’s	too	good	for	’em,	sure,	the	haythen	miscreants!	I’d	boil	’em	alive, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sor,	 or	 roast	 ’em	 in	 the	 stoke-hold,	 begorrah,	 if	 I	 had	 me	 own	 way	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">’em.	I	would,	sor,	so	hilp	me	Moses,	if	all	the	howly	saints,	whose	names</p>

<p class="calibre1">the	murtherin’	bastes,	the	daymans,	the	divvles!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 was	 almost	 beside	 himself	 in	 his	 rage	 and	 passionate	 invective.	 So</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a>much	 so,	 indeed,	 that	 Mr	 Stokes,	 despite	 his	 own	 hearty	 sympathy	 with the	 like	 cause,	 looked	 at	 the	 infuriated	 Irishman	 in	 great	 trepidation,	 for his	face	was	flushed,	and	his	hair	seemed	actually	to	stand	on	end,	while</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	words	tumbled	out	of	his	mouth	pell-mell,	jostling	each	other	in	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">eagerness	to	find	utterance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	chief	really	fancied,	I	believe,	that	he	had	suddenly	gone	mad,	as	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">literally	fumed	with	fury. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 a	 few	 moments,	 however,	 Garry	 cooled	 down	 a	 bit,	 restraining</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself	 by	 a	 violent	 effort,	 and	 he	 turned	 to	 his	 whilom	 patient	 with	 an apologetic	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith,	sor,	I	fancied	I	had	that	divvle,	your	fri’nd,	the	markiss,	sure,	be	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">throat,”	said	he,	with	a	feeble	attempt	at	a	grin	and	biting	his	lips	to	keep</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 his	 feelings	 while	 he	 dropped	 his	 arms,	 which	 he	 had	 been	 whirling round	his	head	like	a	maniac	only	just	before.	“By	the	powers,	wouldn’t	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">throttle	the	baste	swately,	if	I	had	hould	of	him	once	in	these	two	hands	of</p>

<p class="calibre1">Colonel	Vereker	stretched	out	both	his	impulsively,	and	gripped	those	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Garry	O’Neil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Heavens!”	 he	 cried,	 with	 tears	 in	 his	 eyes.	 “You	 are	 a	 white	 man,	 sir.	 I can’t	say	more	than	that,	and	I	am	proud	to	know	you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Och,	 niver	 moind	 that,	 colonel,”	 said	 the	 Irishman,	 putting	 aside	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">compliment,	 the	 highest	 the	 colonel	 thought	 he	 could	 give.	 “Till	 us	 what you	 did,	 sure,	 afther	 the	 poor	 maimed	 crayture	 was	 murthered	 by	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Haytian	 divvle.	 Faith,	 I	 loathe	 the	 baste.	 I	 hate	 him	 like	 pizen,	 though	 I haven’t	sane	him	yit,	more’s	the	pity;	but	it’ll	be	a	bad	job	for	him	when	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	clap	my	peepers	on	him!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	could	not	do	much,”	said	the	other,	proceeding	with	his	account	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">struggle	 with	 the	 mutineers	 on	 board	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Saint	 Pierre</i>,	 “but	 Captain Alphonse	and	myself	emptied	our	revolvers	at	the	scoundrels	and	floored</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Niver	 you	 fear,	 sor,”	 put	 in	 Garry,	 in	 answer	 to	 this	 remark.	 “His	 father, ould	Nick,	is	keepin’	him	for	somethin’	warm	whin	I	git	hould	of	him.	Faith, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sor,	you	can	bet	your	boots	on	that,	sure!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Colonel	 Vereker	 smiled	 sadly	 at	 the	 impulsive	 Irishman’s	 remark.	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 see	 that	 he	 had	 moved	 every	 fibre	 of	 his	 feeling	 heart	 and	 warm nature	 and	 that	 he	 was	 following	 every	 incident	 of	 his	 terrible	 story	 of atrocities	and	sufferings	with	an	all-engrossing	interest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	rushed	to	the	poop-ladder	to	make	for	the	mocking	brute,	intending	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">grip	 him	 by	 the	 neck,	 as	 you	 have	 suggested,	 sir,”	 said	 he,	 “when,	 by heavens,	I	would	have	choked	the	life	out	of	his	vile	carcass! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	Captain	Alphonse	prevented	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘My	God!	dear	friend,’	he	cried,	catching	hold	of	me	round	the	body	in	his</p>

<p class="calibre1">herself,	will	never	bring	back	the	breath	to	the	brave	lad’s	body!	No,	no, </p>
<p class="calibre1">colonel,	 I	 promise	 you,’	 said	 he,	 at	 the	 same	 time	 kissing	 the	 tips	 of	 his fingers	 and	 elevating	 his	 shoulders,	 in	 his	 French	 fashion,	 ‘We	 will	 do something	 better	 than	 that.	 Only	 wait;	 be	 patient.	 We	 will	 avenge	 him, you	will	see,	but	I	pray	you	do	nothing	rash,	for	the	sake	of	the	little	one.’” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	colonel,”	sang	out	the	skipper,	as	if	in	response	to	these	words	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	French	captain,	“to	avenge	him;	that’s	what	all	of	us	here	have	sworn</p>

<p class="calibre1">Yes,	 and	 so	 we	 will,	 too.	 We’ll	 avenge	 him—the	 poor	 fellow	 whom	 they</p>
<p class="calibre1">butchered.	We	will,	by	George!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a>“Begorrah!”	 exclaimed	 Garry	 O’Neil.	 “You	 can	 count	 on	 me	 for	 one	 on that	 job,	 as	 I	 tould	 ye	 before,	 and	 I	 don’t	 care	 how	 soon	 we	 begin	 it, cap’en!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 me	 too,”	 put	 in	 old	 Mr	 Stokes,	 again	 becoming	 very	 enthusiastic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	whole	lot	must	be	punished,	sir,	when	we	catch	them!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 thought	 so,”	 said	 the	 skipper,	 looking	 round	 at	 us	 and	 then	 turning	 to the	colonel	with	a	proud	air.	“You	see,	sir,	we’re	all	unanimous;	for	I	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">answer	for	this	lad	Haldane,	here,	though	the	poor	chap’s	too	bashful	to</p>

<p class="calibre1">“I	know	what	the	gallant	youth	can	do	already,”	said	the	other,	looking	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	 kindly	 as	 I	 held	 up	 my	 head	 like	 the	 rest,	 but	 with	 a	 very	 red	 face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	 you,	 gentlemen	 all,	 for	 your	 promises.	 Well,	 then,	 on	 my	 friend Captain	Alphonse	putting	the	matter	in	the	way	he	did,	to	make	an	end	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 story,	 I	 held	 back,	 and	 all	 that	 day—it	 was	 last	 Saturday—we</p>
<p class="calibre1">remained	on	the	defensive,	we	five	holding	the	after	part	of	the	ship,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Haytians	and	mutineers	of	our	crew	the	forecastle.	All	of	us,	though, </p>
<p class="calibre1">kept	 on	 the	 watch;	 they	 looking	 out	 for	 land,	 we	 for	 help	 in	 response	 to our	signal	flag	half-mast	high. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	neither	party	saw	what	they	looked	out	and	longed	for;	no	corner	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">land	on	the	horizon	gratified	the	desire	of	their	eyes,	no	ship	hove	in	sight</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	bless	ours	with	the	promise	of	relief! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	next	morning,	Sunday,	it	came	on	to	blow,	and	our	vessel	was	taken</p>
<p class="calibre1">aback	 and	 nearly	 foundered.	 Fortunately,	 though,	 the	 mutineers	 not</p>
<p class="calibre1">interfering,	 most	 of	 them	 being	 seasick	 forwards,	 Captain	 Alphonse	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Basseterre	 started	 down	 into	 the	 waist	 to	 cast	 off	 all	 the	 sheets	 and halliards	 they	 could	 reach,	 letting	 everything	 fly;	 whereupon	 we	 drove</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	 the	 wind	 and	 so	 escaped	 any	 mishap	 from	 this	 source,	 at	 all</p>
<p class="calibre1">events! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Probably	on	account	of	their	prostration	from	the	effects	of	sea-sickness, </p>
<p class="calibre1">our	 enemies	 did	 not	 molest	 us	 in	 any	 way	 throughout	 the	 day;	 but</p>
<p class="calibre1">towards	 the	 morning	 my	 little	 Elsie	 came	 up	 the	 companion-way	 in	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">state	 of	 great	 terror,	 saying	 she	 heard	 a	 sort	 of	 scratching	 in	 the	 hold below,	 and	 that	 Ivan,	 her	 dog,	 was	 growling	 as	 if	 he	 smelt	 somebody</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a>trying	to	get	in,	though	we	could	not	hear	the	dog	on	deck	from	the	noise of	the	wind	and	sea,	and	a	lot	of	loose	ropes	and	swinging	spars	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	making	a	terrible	row	aloft. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 went	 down	 at	 once	 with	 her,	 and	 without	 even	 taking	 the	 trouble	 to listen	 I	 could	 clearly	 distinguish	 the	 sound	 of	 tapping	 beneath	 the	 cabin deck,	despite	the	confused	jabbering	of	Monsieur	Boisson,	and	the	shrill</p>
<p class="calibre1">tones	of	his	wife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 knelt	 down	 then	 and	 put	 my	 ear	 to	 the	 planking,	 Monsieur	 Boisson</p>
<p class="calibre1">watching	me	with	his	bottle-brush	sort	of	hair	standing	straight	up	on	end</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 fright,	 and	 Madame,	 who	 I	 thought	 had	 more	 courage	 than	 he, </p>
<p class="calibre1">though	 such,	 evidently,	 I	 now	 saw	 was	 not	 the	 case—well,	 she	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">rolling	 on	 one	 of	 the	 saloon	 settees	 in	 a	 fit	 of	 hysterics,	 screaming	 and yelling	at	the	top	of	her	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Who’s	there?’	I	called	out	in	French.	‘Are	you	one	of	those	Haytians,	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	friend	and	one	of	us?	Answer!	I	will	know	who	it	is	when	you	speak!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘I	 am	 a	 friend!’	 came	 back	 instantly	 in	 Spanish.	 ‘Let	 me	 out,	 sir;	 I	 am nearly	 stifled	 down	 here.	 The	 three	 of	 us	 who	 were	 locked	 in	 the	 main hatch	 have	 worked	 through	 the	 cargo	 and	 broken	 the	 after	 bulkhead, </p>
<p class="calibre1">making	our	way	here,	but	we	can’t	get	out	of	this,	for	the	trap	is	fastened</p>
<p class="calibre1">down,	sir!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	Pedro	Gomez,	the	steward,	who	had	gone	down	into	the	hold	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">two	 of	 the	 white	 sailors	 just	 before	 the	 outbreak	 of	 the	 mutiny	 to	 obtain some	salt	pork	and	other	food	for	the	use	of	the	very	scoundrels	who	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">imprisoned	them,	and	who,	probably,	believed	they	had	all	three	died	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	 time,	 like	 poor	 Cato,	 only	 through	 suffocation,	 instead	 of	 being</p>
<p class="calibre1">murdered	as	he	was! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Needless	 to	 say,	 I	 immediately	 drew	 back	 the	 bolts	 of	 the	 hatchway</p>
<p class="calibre1">cover	leading	down	into	the	after-hold,	which	was	just	under	the	flooring</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	little	Elsie’s	cabin,	and	released	the	three,	overjoyed	not	only	at	finding</p>
<p class="calibre1">alive	those	whom	we	had	thought	dead,	but	doubly	so	at	having	such	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">welcome	 addition	 to	 our	 small	 force	 of	 five—I	 couldn’t	 rely	 upon	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">coward	Boisson—opposed	as	we	were	to	the	thirty,	whom	the	enemy	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">mustered,	after	deducting	those	we	shot. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a>“Why,	with	this	adventitious	aid,	we	could	now	attack	the	cursed	wretches in	 their	 stronghold,	 instead	 of	 our	 merely	 remaining	 on	 the	 defensive, </p>
<p class="calibre1">waiting	for	them	to	assail	us,	as	we	had	been	forced	to	do	all	along! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	it	best,	however,	not	to	let	the	Haytian	scoundrels	know	of	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">increase	 to	 our	 strength	 until	 the	 morrow,	 believing	 that	 if	 we	 waited	 till daylight	we	might	be	able	to	take	them	more	completely	then	by	surprise</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	ensure	a	victory;	for	in	the	dark	we	might	get	mixed	up	and,	firing	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">random,	 hit	 our	 friends	 as	 well	 as	 our	 foes.	 So	 I	 went	 up	 above	 and spoke	 to	 Captain	 Alphonse,	 who	 agreed	 with	 me	 about	 it,	 and	 we</p>
<p class="calibre1">planned	a	pleasant	little	fête	for	the	morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	broke	auspiciously	enough,	the	sun	rising	on	a	tolerably	calm	sea, </p>
<p class="calibre1">while	 the	 strong	 wind	 of	 the	 previous	 evening	 had	 graduated	 down	 to	 a gentle	breeze	from	the	south-west. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 hardly	 had	 we	 made	 all	 our	 arrangements	 as	 to	 the	 distribution	 of arms	 and	 settling	 our	 form	 of	 attack,	 when	 our	 plans	 were	 upset	 by	 the villainous	‘marquis’	advancing	aft	with	a	pistol	in	his	hand,	supported	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">another	of	the	scoundrels,	a	negro	like	himself	from	Port	au	Prince,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">black	 as	 a	 coal,	 but	 a	 regular	 giant	 in	 size,	 and	 who	 likewise	 held	 a revolver. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Heavens!	 They	 had	 previously	 been	 without	 firearms,	 wherein	 lay	 our</p>
<p class="calibre1">superiority	in	spite	of	numbers;	but	these	weapons	now	put	us	almost	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">level	terms,	notwithstanding	the	reinforcement	we	had	received. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Where	 could	 they	 have	 got	 ’em,	 sir?’	 said	 little	 Mr	 Johnson	 to	 me,	 he and	Captain	Alphonse	and	myself	being	in	counsel	together	at	the	time,	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	 the	 watch	 below	 of	 Don	 Miguel	 and	 Basseterre	 and	 the	 sailor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Duval,	 all	 three	 of	 whom	 were	 asleep	 in	 the	 wheel-house,	 recruiting	 for their	 night	 duty.	 ‘They	 didn’t	 have	 no	 firearms	 yesterday,	 colonel,	 I’ll swear.	Do	you	think	they’ve	murdered	the	mate	and	bo’sun	forrads,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">robbed	’em?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	 a	 similar	 idea	 flashed	 through	 my	 mind,	 that	 devil,	 the	 ‘marquis,’</p>
<p class="calibre1">answered	the	little	Englishman’s	question	as	I,	too,	had	feared! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Oh!	my	friend,’	he	called	out,	as	I	covered	him	with	my	revolver	from	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">rampart	 behind	 the	 poop-rail	 on	 the	 top	 of	 the	 ladder,	 where	 a	 roll	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a>tarpaulin	 served	 us	 for	 shelter.	 ‘Don’t	 be	 too	 handy	 with	 your	 pistol.	 We have	got	firearms	too,	now.	Stop	a	minute.	I	have	got	something	to	say	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">you.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘You	had	better	make	haste	with	your	speech,	then,’	said	I.	‘My	finger	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">itching	to	pull	the	trigger,	and	you	know,	to	your	cost,	I’m	a	dead	shot!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘You	will	not	do	much	good	by	killing	me,’	he	retorted	with	that	mocking</p>
<p class="calibre1">hyena	laugh	of	his,	which	always	exasperated	me	so	much.	‘I	want	to	tell</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	that	we	know	you	have	got	three	more	men	with	you	now	than	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	yesterday,	for	we	searched	the	hold	this	morning	and	found	the	nest</p>
<p class="calibre1">empty	and	the	birds	flown.	But	recollect,	my	friend,	we	can	get	to	you	aft</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	the	cargo,	in	the	same	way	as	those	white-livered	wretches	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">done!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Bah!	 I’m	 not	 afraid	 of	 your	 threats,	 you	 black	 devil,’	 I	 replied,	 although my	heart	went	down	to	my	boots	at	the	thought	of	my	darling	child	being</p>
<p class="calibre1">caught	unawares	and	being	left	to	the	mercy	of	such	demons.	‘We	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">scuttled	 the	 after	 part	 of	 the	 ship,	 and	 at	 the	 least	 noise	 being	 heard	 in the	hold	we	will	let	in	the	water	and	drown	you	all	like	rats	in	a	hole,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	how	you	like	that!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 idea,	 which	 occurred	 to	 me	 on	 the	 spur	 of	 the	 instant,	 evidently impressed	 the	 scoundrel,	 for	 I	 could	 see	 a	 change	 come	 over	 his	 ugly</p>
<p class="calibre1">face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Let	us	make	a	compromise,’	he	suggested	after	a	pause,	during	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 whispered	 to	 his	 companion,	 the	 giant	 negro,	 both	 keeping	 much</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind	the	mainmast.	‘You	can	take	that	boat	you	have	there	at	the	stern, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	lot	of	you,	if	you	like,	and	leave	us	the	ship.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘My	word,	that’s	a	very	good	proposal,	marquis,’	said	Captain	Alphonse, </p>
<p class="calibre1">coming	to	my	side.	‘You	won’t	interfere	with	us,	I	suppose,	if	we	go	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	give	you	absolute	power	to	do	what	you	please	with	the	 <i class="calibre4">Saint	Pierre</i>, </p>
<p class="calibre1">eh?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Assuredly	 not,	 my	 friend;	 we	 promise	 that,’	 eagerly	 replied	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">scoundrel,	 deceived	 by	 the	 manner	 of	 my	 poor	 friend.	 ‘You	 can	 take</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything	you	like	of	your	personal	effects	too;	you	and	the	other	whites.’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a>“‘Ah,	 but	 my	 friend,	 you	 are	 too	 good!’	 said	 Captain	 Alphonse,	 firing quickly	 as	 he	 spoke	 at	 the	 ‘marquis,’	 who	 had	 incautiously	 exposed</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself,	thinking	we	had	been	gulled	by	his	proposal	and	were	ready	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">fall	into	the	trap	he	had	cunningly	prepared	for	us.	‘Take	that,	you	pig,	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	answer!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“His	revolver	gave	out	a	sharp	crack,	and	simultaneously	with	the	report, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	other’s	pistol	fell	from	his	hand,	the	scoundrel’s	elbow	being	shattered</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	the	shot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ere	 I	 could	 send	 a	 shot	 in	 the	 same	 direction	 to	 finish	 him	 off,	 the	 big negro,	who	had	accompanied	him	to	the	front,	instantly	dragged	back	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘marquis,’	howling	with	rage	and	pain,	behind	the	shelter	of	the	mainmast; </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	then,	picking	up	his	revolver	for	him,	the	two	of	them	blazed	amongst</p>
<p class="calibre1">us	pretty	securely	from	that	retreat,	without,	however,	doing	any	damage</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	our	side.	A	bullet	of	mine,	though,	flattened	the	big	negro’s	nose	a	little</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	 than	 Nature	 had	 already	 done	 for	 him,	 and	 which	 did	 not	 improve</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	beauty,	as	you	can	well	believe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	kept	on	popping	away	at	them	whenever	we	saw	we	had	a	shot,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">whole	of	this	day;	well,	that	was	only	yesterday,	but	appears	ages	ago	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">me,	 sirs!	 We	 kept	 on	 firing	 without	 materially	 diminishing	 their	 strength, but	 they	 only	 replied	 feebly	 to	 our	 fire,	 with	 an	 occasional	 shot	 fired	 at intervals,	 making	 up	 by	 their	 shouting	 and	 demoniacal	 yells	 for	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1">failure	to	harm	us	more	effectively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“From	this	we	became	convinced	that	they	were	obliged	to	husband	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">ammunition,	 having	 no	 more	 cartridges	 beyond	 those	 still	 remaining	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 chambers	 of	 the	 revolvers	 they	 were	 using,	 which	 had	 been	 loaded</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	 served	 out	 to	 Monsieur	 Henri	 and	 the	 boatswain,	 to	 whom	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">weapons	originally	belonged.	There	was,	likewise,	little	doubt	but	that	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mutineers	had	robbed	those	poor	fellows,	after	murdering	them	like	poor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cato,	in	the	forecastle,	as	the	little	Englishman	had	surmised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Towards	 sunset,	 later	 on	 in	 the	 afternoon—last	 night	 that	 was—Señor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Applegarth,	remember,	we	sighted	your	vessel	in	the	distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Heavens!	She	looked	to	us	in	our	desperate	strait	as	an	angel	of	mercy</p>
<p class="calibre1">might	 appear	 to	 the	 spirits	 of	 the	 damned	 in	 hell;	 and,	 at	 once,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a>thought	 of	 abandoning	 our	 accursed	 ship,	 which	 that	 fiend	 of	 a	 black</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘marquis’	unwillingly	suggested,	rapidly	matured	itself	into	a	resolve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	our	intentions	in	carrying	out	this	determination	were	very	different	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his,	for	we	believed	that	with	your	help	we	should	the	sooner	be	able	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">overcome	 the	 rascally	 gang,	 and	 re-conquer	 the	 vessel	 we	 might	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">compelled	ere	long	to	surrender,	all	of	us	now	being	pretty	well	worn	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	struggle! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘This	 is	 grand!	 this	 is	 magnificent!’	 cried	 Captain	 Alphonse,	 when	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">unfolded	this	scheme	to	him;	for,	sirs,	I	may	say	with	pardonable	pride,	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	my	plan	entirely.	‘It	is	good	tactique	to	beat	the	retreat	sometimes	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">war.	They	retreat	that	they	may	the	more	easily	advance!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don	Miguel	was	also	of	a	like	opinion,	and	so	was	the	little	Englishman, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr	 Johnson,	 whose	 snobbishness	 had	 by	 this	 time	 been	 completely	 put</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 shade	 by	 his	 manly	 pluck	 and	 straightforwardness;	 while,	 as	 for Basseterre,	 the	 mate,	 and	 the	 French	 sailors,	 they	 implicitly	 believed	 all that	Captain	Alphonse	approved	of	must	infallibly	be	right! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our	 first	 idea	 was	 to	 attract	 your	 attention	 without	 letting	 the	 Haytians see	what	we	were	up	to,	as,	to	the	best	of	our	belief,	they	had	no	inkling</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	your	proximity;	so	we	were	puzzling	our	brains	how	to	let	you	learn	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">need	in	some	quiet	way,	when	little	Mr	Johnson	suggested	our	burning	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">devil,	 composed	 of	 wet	 gunpowder	 piled	 up	 in	 the	 form	 of	 a	 cone.	 This was	 accordingly	 done,	 and	 the	 ‘devil,’	 when	 lit,	 placed	 on	 the	 top	 of	 the wheel-house,	 all	 the	 rest	 of	 those	 around	 discharging	 their	 revolvers	 in rapid	succession	at	the	rascals	on	the	forecastle	to	take	off	their	attention</p>
<p class="calibre1">while	the	firework	fizzed	and	flared	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 signal,	 however,	 sirs,	 did	 not	 appear	 to	 be	 observed	 by	 your</p>
<p class="calibre1">vessel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was,	though,”	interposed	the	skipper.	“We	thought	you	were	burning	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">blue	 light	 to	 let	 us	 read	 your	 name	 astern,	 but	 you	 were	 too	 far	 off	 for that!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah!	 we	 did	 not	 know	 that,	 and	 the	 failure	 discouraged	 us,”	 replied	 the colonel.	“Still,	whether	we	were	observed	or	not,	we	noticed	your	steamer</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	lying-to,	and	we	made	up	our	minds	to	try	and	reach	her	if	possible, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>should	 we	 be	 able	 to	 get	 out	 of	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Saint	 Pierre</i>	 before	 those	 rascally blacks	got	wind	of	our	scheme	and	tried	to	prevent	our	leaving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	we	set	about	our	preparations	forthwith. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 four	 French	 sailors	 were	 ordered	 to	 prepare	 the	 boat	 which	 hung</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 the	 stern	 davits	 and	 to	 get	 it	 ready	 for	 lowering,	 it	 being	 now	 dark enough	 to	 conceal	 their	 movements,	 while	 Captain	 Alphonse	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Basseterre	 kept	 guard	 over	 the	 approach	 to	 the	 poop	 on	 our	 side,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Don	 Miguel	 and	 the	 Englishman	 defended	 the	 other	 ladder	 leading	 up</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	lower	deck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Leaving	 these	 at	 their	 respective	 stations,	 I	 went	 down	 into	 the	 saloon, accompanied	 by	 Pedro	 Gomez,	 the	 steward,	 to	 procure	 some	 tinned</p>
<p class="calibre1">meats	 and	 biscuits,	 with	 some	 barricoes	 of	 water	 and	 other	 things	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">provision	the	boat,	intending	also	to	warn	Monsieur	and	Madame	Boisson</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 our	 contemplated	 departure;	 not	 forgetting	 also,	 you	 may	 be	 sure,	 to make	 every	 arrangement	 for	 the	 safety	 of	 my	 child,	 who,	 with	 the	 dog, her	constant	companion,	had	remained	below	with	the	ex-milliner	and	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">husband,	though	these	two	had	retired	to	their	cabin,	whence	I	could	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	them	to	stir,	either	by	threat	of	being	left	behind	or	any	entreaty.	No, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they	were	both	as	obstinate	as	mules	in	their	cowardice	and	foolish	fears! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Madame	 declared	 they	 had	 been	 ‘betrayed,’	 and	 asserted	 they	 could</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘die	 but	 once’;	 while	 monsieur,	 ‘le	 brave	 Hercule,’	 on	 his	 part,	 said	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘washed	his	hands	of	all	responsibility.’	It	was	not	his	affair,	he	considered</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself	 perfectly	 satisfied,	 and	 gave	 me	 to	 understand	 he	 would	 not</p>
<p class="calibre1">interfere	on	either	side,	except,	I	expect,	the	victorious	one! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Finding	 all	 remonstrances	 in	 vain,	 I	 was	 just	 going	 to	 force	 them	 away against	their	will,	when	suddenly	there	came	a	loud	shout	from	the	deck</p>
<p class="calibre1">above,	 and	 the	 hasty	 tramp	 of	 feet	 overhead,	 which	 was	 at	 once</p>
<p class="calibre1">responded	 to	 by	 Madame	 Boisson	 with	 a	 shriek	 at	 the	 top	 of	 her	 voice, while	monsieur	cursed	everybody	in	a	whining	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Telling	 Elsie	 to	 stop	 where	 she	 was	 until	 I	 returned	 for	 her,	 I	 rushed	 up the	companion-way,	followed	by	Pedro	Gomez,	only	to	find	everything	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">but	lost! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	French	sailors,	it	seems,	so	Mr	Johnson	told	me	afterwards	in	a	few</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a>hurried	words	of	explanation,	had	‘got	into	a	fog’	over	the	falls	of	the	boat they	 had	 been	 sent	 to	 lower,	 and	 seeing	 the	 clumsy	 way	 they	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">setting	 to	 work	 at	 the	 job,	 both	 Basseterre	 and	 Captain	 Alphonse</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughtlessly	 left	 their	 post	 to	 show	 the	 men	 the	 proper	 way	 to	 do	 the task	 ordered.	 Alas!	 though,	 in	 a	 second,	 while	 the	 whole	 lot	 of	 them	 all had	 their	 backs	 turned	 to	 the	 Haytians,	 these	 demons,	 grasping	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">opportunity	in	a	moment,	rushed	up	on	the	poop	by	the	port-ladder	way, </p>
<p class="calibre1">now	unguarded! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain	 Alphonse,	 hearing	 the	 noise	 of	 their	 approach,	 faced	 about, </p>
<p class="calibre1">fronting	his	foes	like	a	tiger	at	bay,	and	drew	his	revolver	from	his	belt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,	sir,	he	was	too	late! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ere	he	could	put	up	his	hand	to	guard	himself,	for	I	could	see	it	all	in	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">instant,	 as	 I	 emerged	 from	 the	 companion-hatchway,	 the	 giant	 negro, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who	had	abandoned	his	pistol	for	a	hand-spike,	brought	down	this	fearful</p>
<p class="calibre1">weapon	with	a	tremendous	thwack	on	the	side	of	my	poor	friend’s	head</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	result	you	have	seen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	 faith,”	 said	 Garry	 O’Neil.	 “It	 must	 have	 been	 a	 terrible	 blow,	 sure, sor!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 was,”	 replied	 the	 colonel	 grimly.	 “It	 knocked	 him	 down	 like	 a	 bullock, and	 then,	 before	 I	 could	 interfere,	 the	 big	 brute	 took	 up	 Captain</p>
<p class="calibre1">Alphonse,	all	bleeding	and	senseless	as	he	was,	but	still	breathing,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">chucked	him	into	the	sea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 was	 the	 negro’s	 last	 act,	 however;	 for	 as	 he	 broke	 into	 a	 huge guffaw	of	triumph	over	the	ghastly	deed	I	fired	my	revolver,	the	barrel	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	I	shoved	almost	into	his	mouth	and	blew	his	brains	out!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hooray!”	exclaimed	the	impulsive	Garry	O’Neil	on	hearing	this.	“Faith,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">ounly	 wish,	 colonel,	 I	 had	 been	 there	 with	 ye.	 Begorrah,	 I’d	 have	 made</p>
<p class="calibre1">’em	hop	at	it,	sure,	I	bet,	sor! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“After	 that,”	 continued	 the	 narrator,	 we	 had	 some	 stiff	 work	 for	 five</p>
<p class="calibre1">minutes	or	so,	but	by	keeping	the	skylight	between	us,	the	continuous	fire</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	our	four	revolvers	at	such	short	range	proved	too	much	for	them,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	 succeeded	 in	 driving	 the	 blacks	 off	 the	 poop.	 The	 whole	 lot	 of	 them</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a>retreated	back	to	the	forecastle,	leaving	five	of	their	number	dead	about the	decks,	besides	half	a	dozen	or	so	of	the	others	badly	wounded;	all	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">us,	 fortunately,	 escaping	 with	 only	 a	 few	 slight	 bruises	 from	 blows	 from the	Haytian’s	clubs	and	hand-spikes—the	only	weapons	they	used. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	 save	 poor	 Captain	 Alphonse,	 that	 is;	 for	 it	 was	 only	 when	 the	 coast was	 clear	 of	 the	 scoundrels	 and	 the	 poop	 safe	 again	 that	 I	 had	 time	 to think	of	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pedro	 Gomez,	 remaining	 with	 Basseterre	 and	 one	 of	 the	 sailors,	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">guard	 the	 port-ladder	 way	 with	 their	 six-shooters	 loaded	 and	 levelled	 in front,	 commanding	 all	 approach	 aft,	 in	 the	 same	 way	 as	 the	 mate	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">poor	 Captain	 Alphonse	 had	 done	 in	 the	 first	 instance,	 I	 went	 off	 with	 all haste	 to	 the	 stern	 gallery	 to	 see	 what	 had	 become	 of	 my	 unfortunate</p>
<p class="calibre1">friend,	taking	the	other	three	sailors	with	me,	for	though	taking	part	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">general	 scrimmage	 when	 the	 blacks	 invaded	 the	 poop	 so	 unexpectedly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Don	Miguel	and	Johnson	had	stuck	valiantly	to	their	post	by	the	starboard</p>
<p class="calibre1">rail,	and	so	I	had	no	fear	of	another	surprise	on	now	proceeding	aft. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	still	light	enough	to	distinguish	objects	near,	and	as	I	looked	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 side,	 what	 was	 my	 astonishment	 to	 see	 his	 body	 yet	 afloat,	 not	 far from	the	ship.	Aye,	sir,	there	he	was;	and,	stranger	still,	as	my	eye	caught</p>
<p class="calibre1">sight	 of	 him,	 the	 poor	 fellow,	 unconsciously,	 no	 doubt,	 raised	 one	 hand out	 of	 the	 dark	 water	 with	 a	 quick,	 convulsive	 action,	 just	 as	 though	 he were	beckoning	to	me	and	imploring	me	to	save	him! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On	noticing	this—a	fact,	of	course,	which	showed	plainly	enough	that	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 still	 alive—without	 thinking	 of	 what	 I	 was	 doing,	 I	 jumped	 on	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">projecting	bollard	and	dived	from	the	deck	of	the	ship	into	the	sea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 soon	 rose	 to	 the	 surface,	 when,	 swimming	 up	 to	 the	 almost	 lifeless body	 in	 a	 few	 strokes,	 I	 caught	 hold	 of	 a	 portion	 of	 the	 poor	 fellow’s clothing	 and	 commenced	 turning	 it	 towards	 the	 stern	 of	 the	 vessel	 just underneath	 the	 davits,	 whence	 the	 boat	 we	 had	 been	 preparing	 for	 our</p>
<p class="calibre1">flight	 was	 suspended	 all	 ready	 for	 lowering,	 and	 with	 the	 French	 sailors standing	by	above. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Look	 sharp!’	 I	 sang	 out	 to	 them	 from	 the	 water.	 ‘Look	 sharp,	 there! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lower	away!’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a>“In	 their	 haste	 and	 flurry,	 however,	 the	 men	 mistook	 my	 order,	 and thinking	 I	 had	 said	 ‘cut	 away,’	 instead	 of	 ‘lower	 away,’	 one	 of	 the	 fools, who	held	a	cutlass	he	had	caught	up	to	defend	himself	with	when	those</p>
<p class="calibre1">infernal	niggers	rushed	at	us,	the	confounded	idiot	made	a	sweeping	cut</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	the	falls	from	which	the	boat	hung,	severing	them	at	one	blow! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Down	came	the	little	craft	at	once	with	a	splash,	almost	on	the	top	of	me; </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 though	 she	 managed	 to	 ship	 some	 water	 through	 her	 sudden</p>
<p class="calibre1">immersion,	she	quickly	righted	herself	on	an	even	keel,	right	side	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	 George,	 I’d	 have	 keel-hauled	 ’em	 wrong	 side	 down!”	 cried	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">skipper,	out	of	all	patience	at	hearing	of	this	piece	of	gross	stupidity.	“The</p>
<p class="calibre1">damned	awkward	lubbers!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir;	French	sailors	are	not	like	English	ones,	nor	do	they	resemble</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	 American	 shellbacks,	 who	 do	 know	 a	 thing	 or	 two!”	 replied	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">colonel.	“Well,	gentlemen,	to	make	an	end	of	my	story,	I	may	tell	you	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	some	difficulty	in	lifting	the	body	of	poor	Captain	Alphonse	into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">boat	 when	 I	 had	 clutched	 hold	 of	 the	 gunwale;	 but	 after	 a	 time	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">succeeded	in	getting	him	into	the	bows,	rolling	him	over	the	side	anyhow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	I	tried	to	get	in	myself	by	the	stern,	and	had	just	flung	one	of	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">legs	over	when	that	villain	the	black	‘marquis,’	catching	sight	of	me	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	forecastle,	ahead	of	which	the	boat	somehow	or	other	had	drifted	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	 time,	 fired	 at	 me	 with	 probably	 the	 last	 cartridge	 he	 had	 left	 in	 his pistol,	and	which	the	devil	no	doubt	had	reserved	for	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be	 jabers!”	 exclaimed	 Garry	 O’Neil,	 unable	 to	 keep	 silent	 any	 longer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 baste!	 An’,	 sure,	 that’s	 how	 you	 came	 by	 that	 wound	 in	 the	 groin, faith?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,	doctor.	The	shot	struck	me	when	I	was	all	of	a	heap,	and	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 went	 heaven	 only	 knows,	 till	 you	 probed	 the	 wound	 and	 extracted	 the bullet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 must	 have	 tumbled	 into	 the	 boat	 while	 in	 a	 state	 of	 insensibility,	 like poor	 Captain	 Alphonse,	 for	 I	 do	 not	 recollect	 anything	 that	 occurred</p>
<p class="calibre1">immediately	after	I	felt	the	sting	of	the	shot	as	I	was	hit,	and	when	I	came</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	myself	again	I	was	horrified	to	find	I	was	far	away	from	the	ship,	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	could	only	dimly	discern	in	the	distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a>“But	 this	 did	 not	 daunt	 me	 at	 first,	 for	 I	 thought	 I	 should	 be	 able	 to	 row alongside	again	and	get	taken	aboard	through	one	of	the	stern	ports;	but, </p>
<p class="calibre1">will	 you	 believe	 it,	 when	 I	 came	 to	 search	 the	 boat	 for	 the	 oars,	 which Basseterre	 had	 expressly	 told	 those	 clumsy	 sailors	 in	 my	 hearing	 to	 be sure	to	put	into	the	boat	the	very	first	thing	of	all,	can	you	credit	it?	lo	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">behold,	 not	 a	 scull	 nor	 oar	 was	 in	 her;	 not	 a	 stick	 of	 any	 sort	 or	 kind whatever!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 lubbers!”	 said	 Captain	 Applegarth,	 indignant	 again	 as	 he	 paced</p>
<p class="calibre1">backwards	 and	 forwards	 impatiently,	 casting	 an	 occasional	 hurried</p>
<p class="calibre1">glance	at	the	“tell-tale”	suspended	from	the	deck	above	the	saloon	table, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 shifting	 dial	 of	 which	 showed	 we	 were	 now	 changing	 course	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">westward.	“The	damned	lubbers;	the	damn—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	colonel	here	broke	in	with—	“This	discovery,	I	think,	broke	my	heart,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">cried	he,	heaving	a	heavy	sigh.	“It	took	the	last	flickering	gleam	of	hope</p>
<p class="calibre1">away	from	me,	and	I	sank	back	again	to	the	bottom	of	the	boat,	appalled</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 terrified	 in	 my	 mind	 by	 the	 reflections	 and	 thoughts	 of	 what	 might happen	to	my	darling	child	and	those	others	whom	I	had	left	on	board	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Saint	 Pierre</i>,	 deprived	 at	 one	 fell	 blow	 of	 both	 Captain	 Alphonse	 and myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	daylight	dawned	after	a	night	that	seemed	a	century	long,	so	full</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	pain	and	awful	thought	it	was	to	me,	I	saw	the	 <i class="calibre4">Saint	Pierre</i>	 low	 down on	 the	 horizon	 to	 the	 westward	 of	 where	 I	 and	 my	 poor	 friend,	 Captain Alphonse,	 were	 drifting	 on	 the	 desert	 sea.	 The	 sight	 of	 the	 ship	 again, even	 in	 the	 distance,	 and	 the	 warmth	 of	 the	 sun’s	 bright	 beams,	 which made	the	stagnant	blood	circulate	in	my	veins	once	more,	gave	me	hope</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 renewed	 courage,	 for	 I	 recollected	 and	 thought	 that	 after	 all,	 there were	 eight	 white	 men	 still	 left	 on	 board	 the	 ill-fated	 vessel	 to	 keep possession	of	her	and	defend	my	little	one—eight	good	men	and	true,	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">counting	that	dastardly	coward	Boisson,	who	was	skulking	below! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,	 sir,	 the	 wind	 and	 tide	 wafted	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Saint	 Pierre</i>	 away	 beyond	 my vision;	 and—and—sirs,	 the—the	 end	 of	 it	 all	 you	 all	 know	 better	 than	 I can	tell	you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,”	put	in	the	skipper,	“we	saw	your	boat	adrift—at	least,	old	Masters</p>
<p class="calibre1">did—I’ll	give	him	the	credit	for	that.	Then	we	picked	you	up,	and	here	you</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p163"></a>are!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hardly	 had	 the	 skipper	 uttered	 these	 words,	 completing	 the	 colonel’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">story,	when	Mr	Fosset	suddenly	poked	his	head	through	the	skylight	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	after	end	of	the	saloon,	the	hatch	of	which	opened	out	on	the	deck	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	poop	above. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nor	 was	 the	 first	 mate	 merely	 satisfied	 with	 the	 abrupt	 intrusion	 of	 his figurehead	into	our	midst,	for	he	rattled	the	glass	of	the	skylight	in	no	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">gentle	 fashion	 at	 the	 same	 time,	 the	 better,	 I	 suppose,	 to	 attract	 our attention,	 though	 we	 were	 all	 staring	 open-mouthed	 at	 him	 already,	 all</p>
<p class="calibre1">startled	by	his	unexpected	appearance	on	the	scene. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 he	 rattled	 the	 glass	 all	 the	 same	 as	 he	 looked	 down	 upon	 us,	 none the	less;	aye,	all	the	more,	rattled	it	with	a	will,	frightening	us	all! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi!	Cap’en,	Cap’en	Applegarth!”	he	sang	out	at	the	very	top	of	his	voice, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	excited	as	you	please.	“That	ship’s	in	sight!	the	ship’s	in	sight,	at	last, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sir.	 She’s	 hull	 down	 to	 leeward	 about	 seven	 miles	 off!	 But	 we’re</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Twenty	Three. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Within	Hail. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	 George!	 is	 that	 so?”	 ejaculated	 the	 skipper,	 starting	 off	 with	 a	 mad clutch	at	his	cap,	which	he	had	thrown	off	on	to	a	locker	close	by	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">heat	of	his	excitement	during	the	colonel’s	yarn.	“I’ll	be	on	the	bridge	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">jiffey!	Thank	God	for	that	news!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hooray!”	 shouted	 Garry	 O’Neil,	 as	 we	 all	 immediately	 jumped	 from	 our</p>
<p class="calibre1">seats	 on	 hearing	 this	 joyful	 intelligence,	 long	 though	 it	 had	 been	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">coming,	even	the	poor	colonel,	sliding	his	bandaged	leg	off	its	supporting</p>
<p class="calibre1">chair	 and	 standing	 on	 his	 feet,	 prepared	 to	 follow	 the	 skipper	 on	 deck without	 a	 moment’s	 delay.	 “Be	 the	 powers!	 I	 knew	 we’d	 overhaul	 them</p>
<p class="calibre1">divvles	 before	 sundown!	 Faith,	 an’	 I	 tould	 ye	 so,	 colonel;	 I	 tould	 ye	 so, you	know	I	did!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p164"></a>But	 just	 then	 an	 unexpected	 interruption	 arrested	 us	 as	 we	 all	 moved towards	the	companion-way	to	regain	the	deck	above. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look	 here,	 colonel,”	 cried	 a	 voice	 from	 the	 skipper’s	 state	 room	 aft, where	the	commander	of	the	 <i class="calibre4">Saint	Pierre</i>	 was	 supposed	 to	 be	 reposing</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 an	 almost	 insensible	 condition.	 “Get	 out	 of	 here!	 you	 are	 not	 worth being	angry	with.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Begorrah,	it’s	your	poor	fri’nd	in	there!”	said	Garry	O’Neil	to	the	colonel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	 the	 poor	 crayture	 parleyvooing	 about,	 instid	 of	 slaypin’	 loike	 a Christian	whin	he’s	got	the	chance?	Sure,	I’ll	have	to	stop	his	jaundering</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Stay	 a	 moment;	 he’s	 beginning	 again,	 poor	 fellow,”	 remarked	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">colonel,	holding	up	his	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	villains!	take	that!”	called	out	the	Frenchman	in	a	louder	key	and	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">tone	of	anger,	as	if	battling	with	the	blacks	on	board	the	 <i class="calibre4">Saint	Pierre</i>	over again;	and	then,	after	a	pause	we	heard	a	piteous	cry.	“My	God!	they	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">going	to	shoot	me!	Look!	Look!	To	the	rescue,	colonel,	quickly,	quickly,	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	rescue.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bedad,	he’s	in	a	bad	way	entoirely!”	said	Garry,	as	he	and	the	colonel, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with	myself	at	their	heels,	entered	the	after	cabin,	where	we	saw	Captain</p>
<p class="calibre1">Alphonse	sitting	up	in	the	skipper’s	cot	and	gesticulating	frantically.	“What</p>

<p class="calibre1">“He	is	going	over	the	boat	scene	on	the	poop	of	our	unfortunate	vessel, </p>

<p class="calibre1">explained	the	colonel.	“He’s	calling	out	for	help,	as	I	suppose	he	did	then, </p>

<p class="calibre1">“It	 sounds	 moighty	 queer,	 anyhow,”	 continued	 the	 Irishman.	 “Whisht! </p>

<p class="calibre1">can’t	make	h’id	nor	tale	of	it,	sor!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hoist	 the	 flag	 immediately!	 Close	 furl	 the	 main	 topsail!”	 exclaimed	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p165"></a>poor	 wounded	 man	 in	 short	 jerky	 sentences,	 as	 he	 sat	 up	 there	 in	 the swinging	 cot,	 with	 his	 hands	 tearing	 at	 the	 bandage	 that	 was	 bound</p>
<p class="calibre1">round	 his	 head,	 looking	 as	 if	 he	 had	 just	 risen	 from	 the	 dead,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">reminding	me	of	a	picture	I	once	saw	depicting	the	raising	of	Lazarus.	His</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes	were	rolling,	too,	in	wild	delirium,	and	after	gazing	at	us	fixedly	for	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">second	or	two	without	a	sign	of	recognition	on	his	pallid	face,	he	fell	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">prostrate	again	on	the	mattress,	crying	out	in	a	pitiful	wail,	“Alas,	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ship!	Too	late,	too	late,	too	late.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Heavens!”	said	the	colonel,	turning	to	Garry.	“Can’t	you	do	anything	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	put	somethin’	coolin’	on	the	dressin’,	an’	that’ll	make	the	poor	chap’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">h’id	aisier,”	replied	the	other,	suiting	the	action	to	the	word.	“Ice,	sure,	’ud</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	betther;	but,	faith,	there	isn’t	a	morsel	aboard!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whatever	he	did	apply,	however,	had	a	quieting	influence,	and	presently, </p>
<p class="calibre1">after	tossing	from	side	to	side	convulsively,	Captain	Alphonse	closed	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">great	staring	eyes	and	began	to	snore	stertorously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Heaven	be	praised!”	cried	Colonel	Vereker.	“He’s	sleeping	again,	now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith,	an’	a	good	job,	too,	for	him,	poor	crayture,”	said	Garry.	“He’s	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bad	way,	I	till	you,	sor!	an’	he’d	betther	die	aisy	whin	he’s	about	it,	sure, </p>
<p class="calibre1">than	kickin’	up	a	row	that	won’t	help	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What!”	returned	the	colonel.	“Do	you	think	he’s	going	to	die?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Begorrah,	all	the	docthers	in	the	worrld	wouldn’t	save	him!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	 poor	 friend,	 my	 poor	 friend!”	 cried	 the	 colonel.	 “I	 will	 stay	 with	 him then,	to	the	end,	so	as	to	soothe	his	last	moments!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 evidently	 a	 struggle	 going	 on	 in	 Colonel	 Vereker’s	 mind</p>
<p class="calibre1">between	his	desire	to	do	his	duty,	as	he	thought,	to	the	dying	man,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	natural	anxiety	to	be	on	deck	participating	in	all	the	excitement	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">chase	 after	 the	 runaway	 ship	 and	 the	 coming	 fight	 with	 the	 Haytians, </p>
<p class="calibre1">when	 the	 black	 rascals	 would	 be	 called	 to	 a	 final	 account	 for	 all	 the misery	and	bloodshed	they	had	caused. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a>Garry	O’Neil	saw	this,	and	pooh-poohed	the	idea	of	the	colonel	remaining below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith,	 there	 ain’t	 the	 laste	 bit	 of	 good,	 sor,	 in	 yer	 stoppin’	 down	 here	 at all,	 at	 all,”	 said	 he	 in	 his	 brisk,	 energetic	 way.	 “The	 poor	 chap	 won’t	 be afther	stirrin’	ag’in	for	the	next	two	hours	or	more;	an’	if	he	does,	bedad, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	won’t	ricognise	ye,	or	any	one	ilse	for	that	matther!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,	sir	doctor—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Houly	 Moses!	 I	 till	 you,	 colonel,	 there	 ain’t	 no	 use	 in	 your	 stoppin’</p>
<p class="calibre1">another	minnit!”	impatiently	cried	the	good-natured	Irishman,	interrupting</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	half-hearted	expostulator.	“Jist	you	clear	out	of	this	at	once,	an’	go	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">deck	an’	say	the	foightin’	with	those	murtherin’	bleyguards.	I’ll	moind	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">paychant	now	till	that	old	thaife	Weston’s	finished	all	the	schraps	lift	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">plates	 an’	 bottles	 from	 lunch;	 an’	 thin,	 faith,	 he	 shall	 take	 charge	 of	 him an’	 I’ll	 come	 up	 too,	 to	 say	 the	 foon.

There,	now	off</p>
<p class="calibre1">ye	both	go.	Away	wid	ye!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	saying,	he	fairly	pushed	us	out	of	the	cabin;	and,	the	colonel	limping</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	 my	 side	 and	 using	 my	 shoulder	 as	 a	 crutch,	 as	 he	 had	 previously</p>
<p class="calibre1">done,	we	both	went	up	the	companion-ladder,	and	gained	the	poop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	scene	here	presented	a	striking	contrast	to	that	we	had	just	left,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fresh	air,	bright	sun,	and	sparkling	sea	all	speaking	of	life	and	movement, </p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 exchange	 for	 the	 stuffy	 atmosphere	 of	 the	 darkened	 saloon	 and	 its</p>
<p class="calibre1">association	of	illness	and	approaching	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	stiff	breeze	was	blowing	now	from	the	southward,	and	running,	as	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">were,	 to	 the	 northward,	 right	 before	 it,	 the	 skipper	 had	 ordered	 all	 our square	sails	forward	to	be	set	so	as	to	take	every	advantage	of	the	wind, </p>
<p class="calibre1">in	addition	to	our	steam-power,	the	old	barquey	prancing	away	full	speed</p>
<p class="calibre1">ahead,	 with	 her	 topsails	 and	 fore	 canvas	 bellied	 out	 to	 their	 utmost</p>
<p class="calibre1">extent,	 their	 leech	 lifting	 occasionally	 with	 a	 flicker	 as	 she	 outran	 the breeze	 and	 the	 clew-gallant	 blocks	 rattling	 as	 the	 sheets	 slackened	 and grew	taut	again,	while	the	wind	hummed	through	the	canvas	aloft	like	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">thousand	bees	buzzing	about	the	rigging. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a>The	 black	 smoke,	 too,	 was	 rushing	 up	 the	 funnel	 and	 whirling	 in	 the	 air overhead,	uncertain	which	direction	to	take,	from	the	speed	of	the	vessel</p>
<p class="calibre1">inclining	 it	 to	 trail	 away	 aft,	 while	 the	 stiff	 southerly	 breeze	 blew	 it forwards;	so	we	carried	it	all	along	with	us,	hung	up	above	our	dog	vane</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	an	awning	as	we	careered	onwards,	raising	a	deep	furrow	of	swelling</p>
<p class="calibre1">water	 on	 either	 side	 as	 we	 cut	 through	 the	 dancing	 sunlit	 waves,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaving	 a	 long	 white	 wake	 astern	 that	 shone	 through	 the	 blue,	 far	 away behind	 in	 the	 distance,	 to	 where	 sea	 and	 sky	 melted	 into	 one,	 far	 away on	the	horizon	line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Old	 Masters,	 the	 boatswain,	 was	 on	 the	 poop	 when	 the	 colonel	 and	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	 up	 from	 below,	 in	 the	 very	 act	 of	 hauling	 in	 the	 patent	 log	 to ascertain	our	speed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,”	 said	 I,	 as	 he	 looked	 at	 the	 index	 of	 the	 ungainly	 thing,	 which	 is something	 of	 a	 cross	 between	 a	 shark	 hook	 and	 a	 miniature	 screw</p>
<p class="calibre1">propeller.	“What’s	she	doing,	bo’sun?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Doing?	Wot	she’s	a-doing	on,	sir?”	he	replied,	repeating	my	own	words</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	mouthing	them	over	with	much	gusto.	“Why,	sir,	she’s	going	sixteen</p>
<p class="calibre1">knots	 still,	 and	 the	 bloomin’	 old	 grampus	 has	 been	 keeping	 it	 up	 since four	bells.	She	carries	the	wind	with	her,	too;	for	jist	as	we	bore	up	north</p>
<p class="calibre1">awhile	ago,	astern	the	chase,	I’m	blessed	if	the	breeze	didn’t	shift	round</p>
<p class="calibre1">likewise	to	the	south’ard,	keepin’	astern	of	us	as	before!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	is	the	chase?”	I	asked,	not	being	able	to	see	forwards	on	account</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 swelling	 foresail	 and	 other	 intervening	 objects.	 “I	 suppose	 she’s right	ahead,	eh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 sir.	 Jist	 come	 here	 alongside	 o’	 me	 at	 the	 taffrail,”	 said	 he.	 “Now foller	my	finger,	sir.	Look,	there	she	is,	two	points	off	our	starboard	bow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	hull	down	jist	now,	but	we’re	rising	her	fast,	sir.	See,	there	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	right	under	the	foreyard	there!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 looked	 in	 the	 direction	 he	 indicated,	 and	 could	 very	 faintly	 in	 the distance	see	something	white	like	a	sail,	almost	out	of	sight	on	the	ocean</p>
<p class="calibre1">ahead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,	 Masters,”	 said	 I,	 having	 no	 glass	 with	 me	 to	 bring	 her	 nearer,	 and seeing	she	was	too	far	off	for	me	to	distinguish	her	with	the	naked	eye, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a>“are	you	certain	she’s	the	same	craft?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	 sartin,	 Master	 Haldane,”	 he	 answered	 solemnly,	 “aye,	 as	 sartin	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	when	we	goes	aboard	her,	as	go	aboard	her	we	must,	we	shall	both</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 a-goin’	 to	 our	 death!	 That’s	 the	 ‘ghost-ship,’	 Master	 Haldane,	 as	 you and	I’ve	seed	three	times	afore.	May	I	die	this	minute	if	she	ain’t!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Die!	don’t	talk	such	nonsense,	Masters.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 ain’t	 no	 nonsense,	 Master	 Haldane,”	 he	 retorted,	 and	 looking	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">picture	 of	 misery	 and	 unhappiness.	 “That	 there	 ship	 means	 no	 good	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	nor	me,	nor	to	none	of	them	as	seed	her	afore,	I	knows.	It’s	her,	sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">enuff.	No	mortal	ship	could	sail	on	like	that	continually	since	Friday,	right</p>
<p class="calibre1">afore	 the	 wind,	 and	 still	 allers	 be	 a-crossin’	 our	 hawser,	 though	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">canvas	 be	 tore	 to	 ribbings	 and	 never	 a	 man	 aboard,	 as	 we’ve	 seed.	 It ain’t	 nat’ral,	 nohow.	 Aye,	 she	 be	 the	 ‘ghost-ship’	 and	 no	 mistake,—and</p>
<p class="calibre1">God	help	us	all!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 noticed	 at	 the	 moment	 a	 telescope	 lying	 on	 the	 top	 of	 the	 saloon</p>
<p class="calibre1">skylight,	which	Mr	Fosset	must	have	left	behind	him	in	his	haste,	when	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	 from	 the	 bridge	 to	 hail	 the	 skipper	 and	 then	 hurried	 back	 to	 his post;	so,	quickly	catching	up	the	glass,	I	scanned	the	distant	sail,	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">grew	more	perceptible	every	minute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes,	there	was	no	doubt	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	a	full-rigged	ship	running	before	the	wind,	but	going	a	bit	every</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	 and	 then	 off	 her	 course	 as	 if	 under	 no	 proper	 guidance	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1">management,	while	all	her	sails	were	torn	and	hanging	anyhow,	and	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">spars	 and	 rigging	 apparently	 at	 sixes	 and	 sevens,	 as	 though	 she	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	terribly	mauled	by	the	weather. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	Heaven’s	sake,	tell	me!”	cried	the	colonel,	who	had	approached	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">unobserved	 while	 I	 was	 looking	 through	 the	 telescope.	 “Tell	 me,	 is	 she there?	Can	you	see	her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 sir,”	 said	 I.	 “I	 can	 see	 her,	 and	 it’s	 the	 same	 ship	 I	 saw	 the	 other night.	It	is	the	 <i class="calibre4">Saint	Pierre</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ha!”	he	exclaimed,	his	black	eyes	flashing	into	a	passion	that	made	him</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p169"></a>forget	his	lameness,	as	he	strode	to	the	side	of	the	vessel,	where,	resting one	hand	on	the	rail,	he	shook	the	other	menacingly	at	the	ill-fated	craft, </p>
<p class="calibre1">now	 with	 her	 hull	 well	 above	 the	 horizon.	 “Ah,	 you	 black	 devils,	 we’ll settle	you	at	last!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile,	the	skipper,	who	had	gone	up	to	join	Mr	Fosset	on	the	bridge</p>
<p class="calibre1">after	leaving	us	below	so	suddenly,	was	making	his	way	aft	again;	and	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	colonel	turning	round	from	the	rail	he	found	him	at	his	back,	looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	his	shoulder	at	the	ship	we	were	approaching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	skipper	was	all	agog	with	excitement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	George!”	he	exclaimed.	“We’re	closing	on	her	fast	now,	colonel!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	 soon,	 Señor	 Applegarth,	 do	 you	 think	 we’ll	 be	 before	 we’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">alongside	her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	about	half	an	hour	at	the	outside,	sir,	unless	something	gives	way.	We</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 have	 been	 up	 to	 her	 before	 if	 she	 had	 been	 lying-to;	 but	 she’s going	 ahead	 too,	 like	 ourselves,	 and	 not	 making	 bad	 way	 either, </p>
<p class="calibre1">considering	the	state	she’s	in	aloft,	and	her	yawing	this	way	and	that.	It	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">wonderful	how	she	keeps	on!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	 dear!	 oh	 dear!	 she’s	 possessed,	 as	 your	 companion	 here	 said	 just</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	to	the	young	Señor	Haldane.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	you	mustn’t	mind	what	the	bo’sun	says,”	observed	the	skipper.	“He’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">chock	full	of	the	old	superstitions	of	the	sea,	and	makes	mountains	out	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">molehills.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	deuce!	he’s	not	far	wrong	about	the	 <i class="calibre4">Saint	Pierre</i>,	though,	for	if	ever a	 ship	 had	 the	 devil	 aboard,	 I’m	 sure	 she	 has,	 in	 the	 shape	 of	 that villainous	black	‘marquis’!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	 the	 sooner	 the	 better	 for	 us	 to	 see	 about	 ‘Scotching’	 your	 de’il,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">cried	 the	 skipper	 with	 a	 laugh	 that	 meant	 business,	 I	 knew.	 “I’m	 now</p>
<p class="calibre1">going	to	call	the	hands	aft	and	prepare	for	the	fight,	and	they	shall	have	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">hot,	I	can	tell	you,”	said	he. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have	 you	 got	 arms	 enough	 for	 them,	 sir?	 Those	 rascals	 will	 make	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p170"></a>stubborn	 resistance,	 and	 there’s	 a	 big	 lot	 of	 them	 still	 left	 in	 the	 ship, remember!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	skipper	laughed	outright	at	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lord	bless	you,	colonel!”	said	he,	“the	steamers	of	our	line	are	fitted	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	their	way	very	like	men-of-war;	and	I	have	enough	rifles	and	cutlasses</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	arm	chest	below	to	rig	out	more	than	twice	the	number	of	the	crew</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	carry,	besides	revolvers	for	all	the	officers.	This,	however,	will	be	short</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	sharp	work,	as	we’re	going	to	run	your	black	devils	by	the	beard;	so	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">shall	only	serve	out	cutlasses.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you’ll	spare	me	a	revolver,	Señor	Applegarth?	I	left	mine,	as	you	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">aware,	 behind	 me,”	 said	 he	 with	 a	 smile,	 “and	 I	 should	 like	 to	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">another	shot	or	two	at	my	friend,	the	‘marquis’!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	aye,	colonel,	you	shall	have	one,	and	a	good	one	too,	and	so	shall</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	 those	 who	 know	 how	 to	 use	 a	 pistol	 properly;	 but,	 for	 close	 hand-to-hand	fighting,	I	prefer	cold	steel	myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Colonel	 Vereker	 joined	 in	 the	 skipper’s	 grim	 chuckle,	 which	 suited	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">mood	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,	that’s	true,”	he	rejoined;	“but	a	revolver	isn’t	to	be	sneezed	at,	all the	same!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	colonel,	your	leg’ll	bear	witness	to	that,”	said	the	skipper	as	he	turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	me.	“Run	down	quickly,	Haldane,	to	the	arm	chest	in	my	state	room—</p>
<p class="calibre1">here	 are	 the	 keys—and	 pick	 out	 a	 dozen	 or	 so	 cutlasses	 and	 boarding-</p>
<p class="calibre1">pikes,	with	a	revolver	apiece	for	all	on	the	quarter-deck,	and	half	a	dozen</p>
<p class="calibre1">rounds	of	ammunition.	You	can	get	Weston	to	help	you	to	bring	the	lot	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">here.	Look	smart;	I	want	to	serve	them	out	at	once,	as	we’re	now	coming</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	with	the	chase,	and	there’s	no	time	to	lose.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Down	 I	 scuttled	 into	 the	 saloon	 with	 the	 skipper’s	 bunch	 of	 keys;	 and, calling	 the	 steward	 to	 help	 me,	 went	 into	 the	 after	 cabin,	 where	 Garry O’Neil	still	remained,	wetting	the	bandage	round	the	head	of	the	French</p>
<p class="calibre1">captain,	 and	 doing	 it	 too	 with	 greater	 delicacy	 of	 touch	 than	 the	 most experienced	and	flippant	of	hospital	nurses. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p171"></a>Garry	was	delighted	when	I	told	him	what	I	came	about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Houly	Moses!”	he	ejaculated;	“why	that’s	the	virry	job	for	me,	sure.	Here, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weston,	you	ugly	thaife	of	a	son	of	a	gun,	come	here!	There’s	going	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	 rare	 foightin’	 on	 deck	 prisintly;	 an’	 as	 I	 know	 ye	 don’t	 loike	 to	 be afther	spoilin’	that	beautiful	mug	o’	yours,	you	jist	sit	down	there,	alannah, </p>
<p class="calibre1">an’	 moind	 this	 poor	 chap	 here	 till	 I	 come	 below	 ag’in,	 whilst	 I	 help Musther	 Haldane,	 too,	 with	 thim	 murtherin’	 arms	 that	 give	 one	 a	 could</p>
<p class="calibre1">chill,	faith,	to	look	at,	bad	cess	to	’em.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 gave	 me	 a	 sly	 wink	 as	 he	 said	 this,	 which	 was	 unperceived	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1">Weston,	who	accepted	the	proposed	change	of	duty	with	an	alacrity	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">showed	he	had	no	stomach	for	warfare	procedure,	and	Garry	and	I	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">speedily	took	up	a	bundle	of	weapons	each	on	to	the	poop,	laying	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	close	beside	the	skipper,	who	stood	against	the	rail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	 doctor,”	 said	 the	 colonel,	 who	 was	 sitting	 down	 near	 by	 on	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">skylight	 hatchway,	 resting	 himself	 before	 the	 battle	 should	 begin,	 on</p>
<p class="calibre1">seeing	Garry	come	up	the	companion,	“how’s	my	poor	friend	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith,	he’s	still	unconshus,”	replied	he,	handing	him	a	big	revolver	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">cartridge	belt	attached;	“ah,	sure,	I	’spect	he’ll	remain	so,	too,	colonel,	till</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’ve	 had	 toime	 to	 polish	 off	 the	 rest	 of	 thim	 schoindrels	 we’re	 afther. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indade,	it’s	going	off	loike	that	the	poor	crayture	will	be,	I’m	afeard,	whin	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">comes	 to	 the	 ind.	 I	 don’t	 think	 he’ll	 ayther	 spake	 or	 move	 ag’in	 in	 this loife.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Garry	was	mistaken	in	this	diagnosis	of	his,	as	events	turned	out;	but, </p>
<p class="calibre1">ere	 he	 could	 say	 another	 word,	 just	 then	 as	 the	 colonel	 was	 going	 to make	a	reply	to	him,	the	skipper	hammered	on	the	deck	with	a	marling-spike	to	attract	attention	and	give	a	hail	at	the	very	top	of	his	voice	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">made	us	all	jump,	it	was	so	loud	and	unexpected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ahoy	there,	forrad!”	he	shouted	in	stentorian	tones	that	rang	fore	and	aft</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	a	trumpet.	“Bo’sun,	send	the	hands	aft.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Say,	 cap’en,”	 sang	 out	 Mr	 Fosset	 from	 the	 bridge,	 “shall	 I	 call	 up	 the fellows	down	below	in	the	stoke-hold,	sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye.	Ring	the	engine-room	gong.	I	want	every	man-jack	on	deck	that	Mr</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p172"></a>Stokes	can	spare;	tell	him	so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	old	Masters	was	sounding	his	boatswain’s	pipe	and	while	busy	feet</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 tramping	 aft,	 the	 men	 were	 beginning	 to	 cluster	 in	 the	 waist</p>
<p class="calibre1">immediately	 below	 the	 back	 of	 the	 poop.	 And	 here	 Captain	 Applegarth</p>
<p class="calibre1">stood	stern	and	erect	like	an	old	lion,	his	cap	off	and	his	wavy	grey	hair</p>
<p class="calibre1">fluffed	out	over	his	head	by	the	wind.	While	this	was	happening	we	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear	 the	 distant	 sound	 of	 the	 engine-room	 bell,	 and	 then	 there	 came	 a hail	from	Mr	Fosset. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr	 Stokes	 is	 sending	 up	 every	 one	 from	 below,	 sir,”	 yelled	 out	 the	 first mate.	 “He	 says	 he	 can	 manage	 by	 himself	 now	 that	 we’re	 nearly	 up	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 chase,	 with	 the	 help	 of	 a	 couple	 of	 the	 other	 firemen;	 and	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">engineers	and	stokers,	the	whole	lot	of	them	in	a	batch,	have	volunteered</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	come	on	deck	and	join	the	boarding	party.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 your	 sort,	 my	 hearty,”	 cried	 the	 skipper	 enthusiastically,	 looking down	 at	 the	 sea	 of	 excited	 faces	 below	 gazing	 up	 expectantly	 at	 his, </p>
<p class="calibre1">awaiting	the	stirring	words	they	knew	to	be	coming,	all	having	got	wind	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 approaching	 fray.	 “Now,	 men,	 I	 have	 summoned	 the	 lot	 of	 you	 aft</p>
<p class="calibre1">because—well,	because	I’ve	got	something	to	say	to	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bully	for	you,	old	man,”	exclaimed	one	of	the	men,	amidst	a	grand	roar, </p>
<p class="calibre1">while	 I	 could	 distinguish,	 distinctly	 above	 the	 other	 voices	 of	 the	 crew, Accra	Prout,	the	mulatto	cook’s	laugh	as	he	called	out	approvingly,	“Golly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">dat	so,	sonny!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Heavens!”	 ejaculated	 Colonel	 Vereker,	 seemingly,	 like	 myself,	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognise	the	voice	at	once,	“who’s	that?”	said	he	sharply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Accra	Prout,	who	stood	a	head	taller	than	any	other	of	the	men	clustered</p>
<p class="calibre1">round	 him,	 caught	 sight	 of	 the	 colonel	 as	 the	 latter	 cast	 his	 eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">downwards,	 rising	 from	 his	 seat	 and	 coming	 to	 the	 side	 of	 the	 skipper; and	the	mulatto’s	eyes	grew	as	large	as	saucers,	while	his	eyeballs	rolled</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	delight	and	his	wide	mouth	extended	itself	from	ear	to	ear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bress	 de	 Lor’!”	 he	 cried	 out,	 with	 all	 a	 darkey’s	 emphatic	 enthusiasm, breaking	 into	 a	 huge	 guffaw	 that	 was	 almost	 hysterical—“bress	 de	 Lor’! </p>
<p class="calibre1">it’s	de	massa;	it’s	Mass’	Vereker	from	de	plantation,	for	surh!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p173"></a>“Yes,	it’s	me,	myself,	sure	enough,	Prout;	and	I’m	right	glad	to	see	you,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said	the	colonel,	equally	delighted.	“There,	Señor	Applegarth,	didn’t	I	tell</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	any	of	my	old	Louisianian	hands	would	like	to	see	me	again,	in	spite</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	what	I	said	about	those	infernal	niggers	who	seized	our	ship?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	 you	 did,	 colonel,	 you	 did,”	 replied	 the	 skipper,	 waving	 his	 hand	 in the	air;	“but	never	mind	that	now—I’m	going	to	speak	to	the	crew.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,	 me	 bhoys,	 altogether,”	 cried	 Garry	 O’Neil,	 looking	 over	 the	 top	 of the	 booby-hatch	 over	 the	 companion-way,	 “three	 cheers	 for	 the	 cap’en, </p>
<p class="calibre1">horray!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Horray!”	 roared	 the	 lot	 below	 with	 a	 kindred	 enthusiasm,	 “Horray! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Horray!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	almost	within	hail	now	of	the	chase,	sir,”	sang	out	Mr	Fosset	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	bridge	when	the	echo	of	the	last	deafening	cheer	had	died	away;	“I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">going	to	slow	down,	so	that	we	can	sheer	up	alongside.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 just	 what	 I	 was	 waiting	 for,”	 said	 the	 skipper	 in	 answer	 to	 this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,	men,	you	see	that	ship	ahead	of	us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,”	 called	 out	 the	 foremost	 hand,	 who	 had	 before	 spoken—the	 usual</p>
<p class="calibre1">leader,	and	the	wit	of	the	fo’c’s’le—“the	ghost-ship,	cap’en.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 ghost-ship,	 devil-ship,	 or	 whatever	 she	 may	 be,	 my	 lads,	 we’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">going	to	board	her	and	rescue	a	young	lady,	a	child	in	age,	the	daughter</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 my	 friend,	 Colonel	 Vereker	 here,	 and	 a	 lot	 of	 white	 men	 like</p>
<p class="calibre1">yourselves,	 who	 are	 now	 at	 the	 mercy	 of	 a	 gang	 of	 black	 demons	 who</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 murdered	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 passengers	 and	 crew	 and	 taken</p>
<p class="calibre1">possession	of	the	vessel.	Are	you	going	to	stand	by	me,	lads?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	answer	was	another	deafening	cheer,	heartier	and	louder	even	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	I	thought	I	could	reckon	on	your	help,”	cried	the	skipper	in	a	tone	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">proud	 satisfaction,	 glancing	 round	 at	 the	 colonel.	 “I	 have	 got	 your	 tools handy	for	you,	too,	my	lads;	and	if	you	will	come	up	to	the	poop	in	single</p>
<p class="calibre1">file	by	the	port-ladder,	going	down	again	by	the	starboard	gangway,	each</p>
<p class="calibre1">shall	 be	 supplied	 in	 turn.	 Mr	 O’Neil,	 please	 serve	 out	 the	 cutlasses	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p174"></a>boarding-pikes.	 Now,	 my	 men,	 way	 aloft	 there!	 Single	 file,	 and	 no crushing,	mind,	and	we’ll	get	the	job	done	all	the	quicker!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ere	he	had	finished	speaking	the	arming	of	the	men	had	already	begun, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	within	a	very	few	minutes	the	cutlasses	and	long	boarding-pikes	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	been	distributed,	every	man	having	some	weapon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,	bo’sun,	pipe	the	men	to	their	stations,”	sang	out	the	skipper,	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared	 to	 have	 already	 matured	 his	 plan	 of	 action.	 “Starboard	 watch</p>
<p class="calibre1">forrad,	 port	 watch	 aft,	 and	 all	 the	 stokers	 and	 firemen	 amidships,	 under the	bridge.	Have	a	couple	of	hands,	too,	in	the	forechains,	with	a	hawser</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 grapnel,	 ready	 to	 make	 fast	 to	 the	 ship	 when	 we	 come	 alongside</p>
<p class="calibre1">her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	 aye,	 sir,”	 hailed	 back	 Masters.	 “Starboard	 watch	 ahoy!	 Away</p>
<p class="calibre1">forrads	with	you	along	o’	me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	 engines	 had	 already	 slackened	 speed;	 and,	 the	 helm	 being	 put</p>
<p class="calibre1">down,	 we	 came	 up	 to	 the	 wind,	 to	 leeward	 of	 the	 ship	 and	 not	 a	 half cable’s	length	away	from	her,	broadside-on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stand	 by	 there,	 forrad,”	 shouted	 the	 skipper.	 “Ship	 ahoy	 there! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Surrender,	or	we’ll	run	you	aboard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 wild	 savage	 yell	 came	 back	 in	 reply	 from	 a	 number	 of	 half-naked</p>
<p class="calibre1">negroes	who	were	mustered	on	the	after	part	of	the	vessel,	as	well	as	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 forecastle,	 not	 a	 single	 white	 man	 being	 visible,	 while	 her	 Tricolour flag—so	conspicuous	before,	and	which	I	fancied	having	seen	but	half	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">hour	 or	 so	 previously	 when	 looking	 at	 her	 through	 the	 telescope—was</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	no	longer	to	be	seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Could	our	worst	fears	have	been	realised? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	savage	yell	almost	confirmed	the	thought.	“Heavens!”	exclaimed</p>
<p class="calibre1">Colonel	 Vereker,	 rendered	 almost	 frantic	 with	 grief	 and	 excitement,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">noticing	the	appalling	evidences	of	the	Haytians’	triumph,	while	we	stared</p>
<p class="calibre1">aghast	at	each	other.	“My	poor	darling	child,	and	those	brave	fellows	I	left</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind,	 where	 are	 they	 all;	 where	 are	 they?	 For	 God’s	 sake	 find	 them! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alas!	alas!	those	black	devils	have	murdered	them	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p175"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Twenty	Four. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A	Free	Fight. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 hardly	 had	 the	 colonel	 given	 vent	 to	 his	 despairing	 exclamation, </p>
<p class="calibre1">expressive	alike	of	his	own	dismay	and	ours	also,	when	the	bitter	feeling</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 disappointment	 at	 being	 too	 late,	 that	 had	 for	 the	 moment	 weighed</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	upon	us,	crushing	our	enthusiasm,	was	suddenly	banished	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hearts	of	all	filled	with	renewed	hope	and	fierce	determination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	were	not	too	late	after	all! </p>
<p class="calibre1">No. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	as	we	gazed	in	blank	surprise	at	the	howling	mob	of	Haytians,	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared	 to	 have	 gained	 complete	 possession	 of	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Saint	 Pierre</i>,	 and were	 dancing	 about	 and	 gesticulating	 in	 their	 wild,	 devilish	 fashion, </p>
<p class="calibre1">calling	 out	 to	 us	 with	 wild	 derisive	 cries,	 as	 if	 mocking	 at	 our	 efforts	 to save	 those	 whom	 they	 had	 already	 butchered,	 a	 bright	 flame	 of	 fire</p>
<p class="calibre1">flashed	 out	 from	 the	 skylight	 hatch	 of	 the	 doomed	 ship,	 followed	 by	 the sharp	crack	of	a	revolver;	and	at	the	same	instant	one	of	the	half-naked</p>
<p class="calibre1">devils	 massed	 on	 the	 poop	 leaped	 into	 the	 air	 and	 then	 fell	 on	 his	 face flat	 on	 the	 deck,	 uttering	 a	 yell	 of	 agony	 as	 he	 writhed	 his	 limbs	 in	 the throes	of	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	exulting	cheer	broke	from	all	of	us	in	the	 <i class="calibre4">Star	of	the	North</i>	on	seeing this,	 every	 man	 gripping	 his	 weapon	 tightly,	 and	 setting	 his	 teeth	 hard, ready	for	action,	as	the	two	vessels	sidled	up	nearer	and	nearer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	if	word	were	wanted	to	spur	us	on,	the	skipper	gave	that	word	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	vengeance! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	 George!	 my	 lads,	 we’re	 in	 time	 yet	 to	 save	 the	 child	 and	 our	 other white	 comrades!”	 he	 cried	 out	 loudly,	 at	 the	 same	 time	 jumping	 into	 the mizzen	 rigging,	 where	 he	 hung	 on	 the	 shrouds	 with	 one	 hand,	 while	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 other	 he	 held	 a	 cutlass	 which	 he	 had	 hastily	 clutched	 up,	 whirling	 it round	his	lionlike	old	grey	head.	“See,	men,	they’ve	retreated	to	the	cabin</p>
<p class="calibre1">below,	 where	 they’re	 fighting	 for	 their	 lives	 to	 the	 last.	 Tumble	 up,	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p176"></a>lads,	 and	 save	 them,	 like	 the	 British	 sailors	 that	 you	 are!	 Boarders, away!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 he	 said	 this,	 Mr	 Fosset,	 who	 was	 still	 on	 the	 bridge	 conning	 the	 old barquey,	 having	 at	 once	 ported	 our	 helm,	 on	 the	 skipper	 holding	 up	 his cutlass,	taking	this	for	a	signal,	we	came	broadside-on,	slap	against	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hull	of	the	other	ship	with	a	jolt	that	shook	her	down	to	her	very	kelson, </p>
<p class="calibre1">rolling	 a	 lot	 of	 the	 darkies,	 who	 were	 grouped	 aft,	 off	 their	 legs	 like	 so many	 ninepins.	 At	 the	 same	 moment,	 before	 the	 two	 craft	 had	 time	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">glide	apart,	both	having	way	upon	them,	old	Masters	forward,	and	Parrell, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 quartermaster,	 who	 was	 stationed	 in	 the	 waist	 of	 our	 vessel,	 just</p>
<p class="calibre1">under	the	break	of	the	poop,	hooked	on	grapnels,	with	hawsers	attached, </p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 weather	 rigging	 of	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Saint	 Pierre</i>;	 and	 ere	 the	 skipper’s	 rallying cry	and	our	answering	cheer	had	died	away,	drowned	by	the	voice	of	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">escaping	steam	rushing	up	the	funnels	on	the	engines	coming	to	a	stop, </p>
<p class="calibre1">now	that	their	duty	for	the	nonce	was	done,	there	we	were	moored	hard</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	fast	together,	alongside	the	whilom	dreaded	“ghost-ship!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	with	another	wild	hurrah	that	made	the	ringbolts	in	the	deck	jingle, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	swamped	the	sound	of	the	rushing	steam	and	everything,	the	men, </p>
<p class="calibre1">closing	up	behind	the	skipper,	who	led	us	so	gallantly	over	the	side,	far	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">advance,	 brave-hearted	 old	 sea	 dog	 that	 he	 was,	 bounded	 across	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">intervening	 bulwarks,	 and	 were	 the	 next	 instant	 engaged	 in	 all	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">maddening	 excitement	 of	 a	 hand-to-hand	 tussle	 with	 the	 black	 villains, </p>
<p class="calibre1">pistol	 shot,	 sword	 cut	 and	 pike	 thrust	 coming	 in	 turn	 into	 play,	 amid	 a babel	 of	 hoarse	 shouts	 of	 rage	 and	 cheers	 and	 savage	 yells—mingled</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	swish	of	blows	from	capstan	bars,	the	loud	reports	of	revolvers</p>
<p class="calibre1">fired	 off	 at	 close	 range	 and	 the	 heavy	 thud	 of	 falling	 bodies	 as	 they tumbled	headlong	on	the	deck	ever	and	anon,	accompanied	by	some	cry</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	agony	or	groan	of	pain	too	deep	for	utterance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aye,	 it	 was	 a	 discord	 of	 devilry	 that	 must	 have	 appeared	 a	 veritable</p>
<p class="calibre1">pandemonium	to	the	spirits	of	the	air,	were	any	such	looking	down	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrathful,	sanguinary	scene	from	the	clear	blue	heavens	above,	all	radiant</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	with	a	golden	glow	that	came	from	the	west,	where	the	declining	sun</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	just	beginning	to	sink	below	the	horizon! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fuaghaballah,	 may	 the	 divvle	 take	 the	 hindmost!”	 cried	 Garry	 O’Neil, </p>
<p class="calibre1">leaping	after	the	skipper	on	to	the	poop	of	the	 <i class="calibre4">Saint	Pierre</i>,	a	revolver	in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p177"></a>his	right	fist	and	a	cutlass	in	his	left,	laying	about	him	with	a	will	amongst the	mass	of	infuriated	negroes	who	tried	to	resist	his	rush,	clutching	at	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">legs	 and	 arms	 in	 vain,	 for	 he	 seemed	 bewitched.	 “Come	 on	 wid	 ye,	 me</p>
<p class="calibre1">darlints,	an’	let	us	make	mincemate	of	’em,	faith!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	followed	in	his	wake,	but	a	crowd	of	our	men,	some	of	whom	had	served</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	navy	and	were	accustomed	to	the	work,	pushed	me	on	one	side, </p>
<p class="calibre1">going	into	the	thick	of	the	fight	themselves,	and	all	was	such	a	jumble	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">confusion	that	I	hardly	knew	where	I	was	until	“a	pretty	tidy	tap	on	the	top</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	my	head,”	as	Garry	would	have	said,	brought	back	my	recollection	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	effective	manner,	when	I	found	myself	right	in	front	of	an	extremely</p>
<p class="calibre1">ugly-looking	 negro,	 whose	 appearance	 was	 not	 improved	 by	 a	 slice</p>
<p class="calibre1">having	 been	 taken	 off	 the	 side	 of	 his	 face,	 and	 from	 which	 blood	 was streaming	down	all	over	his	black	body,	and	that	destitute	of	clothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 noticed	 that	 this	 gentleman	 had	 a	 long	 piece	 of	 wood	 like	 a	 boat</p>
<p class="calibre1">stretcher	 in	 his	 hands,	 with	 which	 he	 had	 evidently	 given	 me	 the	 gentle reminder	 I	 have	 mentioned,	 being	 brought	 to	 this	 conclusion	 by	 the	 fact that	the	rascal	had	it	raised	ready	to	deal	another	blow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Putting	 up	 my	 arm	 instinctively	 to	 ward	 off	 the	 impending	 stroke	 that	 I saw	coming,	I	cocked	and	levelled	my	revolver	at	him	in	an	instant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	 I	 could	 fire,	 however,	 some	 one	 behind	 me	 shoved	 me	 aside</p>
<p class="calibre1">again,	and	crash	came	a	heavy	capstan	bar	down	upon	the	negro’s	skull, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which	I	heard	crack	like	a	walnut	shell	as	he	dropped	dead	on	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Golly,	 Mass’	 Hald’n,”	 exclaimed	 Accra	 Prout,	 our	 stalwart	 mulatto	 cook, whose	 sinuous	 arm	 had	 thus	 incontinently	 settled	 the	 dispute	 between</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	sable	opponent	and	myself.	“I’se	guess	dis	chile	gib	dat	black	debble</p>
<p class="calibre1">goss,	noh	ow!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 ere	 I	 could	 say	 a	 word	 to	 him	 for	 his	 timely	 aid,	 Accra	 Prout	 had bounded	 onward	 in	 front,	 and	 I	 then	 saw	 he	 was	 following	 Colonel</p>
<p class="calibre1">Vereker,	who	had	managed	somehow	or	other,	in	spite	of	his	lameness, </p>
<p class="calibre1">to	gain	the	deck	of	his	old	ship	along	with	the	rest	of	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crack,	 crack,	 crack,	 went	 his	 revolver	 with	 venomous	 iteration	 from	 the other	side	of	the	vessel,	where	he	was	standing	by	the	bulwarks,	close	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	hatchway	of	the	companion-ladder	leading	to	the	cabin	below,	which</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p178"></a>he	 was	 apparently	 endeavouring	 to	 reach,	 while	 a	 crowd	 of	 Haytians barred	his	further	progress	towards	those	imprisoned	in	the	cabin,	whom</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	thus	prevented	his	releasing,	a	fresh	foe	starting	up	for	every	one	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">disposed	of,	and	a	rough	and	terrible	fight	going	on	all	round	him	all	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“’Top	 a	 minnit,	 Mass’	 V’reker!”	 shouted	 Accra	 Prout,	 darting	 into	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">middle	of	the	throng,	clearing	a	pathway	for	himself	with	the	capstan	bar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’se	here;	I’se	come	help	you	soon!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	 thousand	 devils!”	 hissed	 a	 tall	 black	 near	 by—a	 man	 with	 a	 large, </p>
<p class="calibre1">crinkly,	ink-black	moustache,	and	certainly	with	the	most	satanic	visage	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 ever	 beheld	 before.	 “A	 thousand	 devils!”	 repeated	 he,	 giving	 him	 a thrust	 with	 a	 large	 knife	 that	 pierced	 poor	 Accra’s	 arm,	 and	 making	 him drop	the	capstan	bar.	“Take	care	of	yourself—beast!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	cry	from	the	colonel	told	me	who	this	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	villain,	villain!”	he	sang	out,	looking	him	full	in	the	face	and	grinding</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	teeth	and	trying	with	all	his	might,	but	vainly,	to	get	at	him	through	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">press	 of	 struggling	 figures	 by	 whom	 he	 was	 surrounded.	 “I’ve	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking	for	you,  <i class="calibre4">Marquis	des	Coupgorges</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 black	 scoundrel	 gave	 out	 a	 shrill	 laugh	 like	 that	 of	 a	 hyena,	 as Colonel	Vereker	had	described	it	to	us	when	telling	his	yarn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pardon	me,	sir,	I	am	here,”	he	yelled	out	mockingly.	“I	am	here.	I	do	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">run	away	like	your	white	trash!	Why	don’t	you	come	and	fight	me?	Bah!	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">spit	on	you,	my	fine	plantation	colonel.	When	I	get	at	you	I	will	serve	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	 as	 I	 did	 your	 sly	 slave	 the	 other	 day,	 whom	 you	 sent	 to	 betray	 us, though	you,	yourself,	were	too	great	a	coward	to	come	amongst	us,	yes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">to	come	amongst	us	yourself.	Aha!	colonel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	said	this	in	plain	English,	which	language	he	spoke	as	fluently	as	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">did	French,	the	native	language	of	Hayti,	uttering	his	abusive	threats	loud</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough	for	us	to	hear	every	syllable;	but	though	I	aimed	at	him	while	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 speaking	 twice	 point	 blank,	 and	 my	 revolver	 spoke	 out	 quite	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">loudly	as	he,	while	the	colonel	likewise	shot	at	him	and	the	skipper	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 slash	 in	 his	 direction	 with	 his	 cutlass,	 the	 miscreant	 escaped	 all	 our attacks	without	a	single	wound,	dodging	away	from	us	amongst	his	dusky</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p179"></a>compatriots,	 who	 were	 now	 pretty	 thickly	 mixed	 up	 with	 our	 men	 in	 a fierce	 <i class="calibre4">mêlée</i>,	at	the	further	end	of	the	poop,	overlooking	the	waist	below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	midst	of	this	awful	scrimmage	there	came	a	wild	rush	aft	of	all	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">remaining	 blacks	 who	 had	 been	 engaged	 with	 some	 of	 the	 hands</p>
<p class="calibre1">amidships,	pursued	by	our	second	boarding	party,	led	by	Mr	Fosset	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Stoddart,	 who	 had	 made	 their	 way	 over	 the	 bows	 and	 cleared	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fo’c’s’le,	fighting	onward	step	by	step	along	the	upper	deck;	and	hemmed</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	fast	thus,	between	two	fires,	the	black	desperadoes	made	a	last	stand, </p>
<p class="calibre1">refusing	to	surrender,	or	throw	down	their	arms	in	spite	of	all	promises	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">quarter	on	our	part. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 of	 them	 could	 see	 for	 themselves	 how	 completely	 overmatched	 they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were,	 and	 must	 have	 known	 the	 utter	 uselessness	 of	 attempting	 any</p>
<p class="calibre1">further	 resistance	 to	 us;	 but	 the	 mutineers	 of	 the	 negro	 portion	 of	 the <i class="calibre4">Saint	Pierre’s</i>	crew,	who	were	now	in	the	majority,	feared	to	give	in	owing to	the	fact	of	their	believing	they	would	be	ultimately	hanged	if	taken	alive</p>
<p class="calibre1">after	the	atrocities	they	had	committed;	so	being	of	the	opinion	they	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">bound	 to	 be	 killed	 in	 any	 case,	 they	 determined	 apparently,	 if	 die	 they must,	they	would	die	fighting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whatever	might	be	their	motive	or	conviction,	I	will	give	them	the	credit	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	 plucky,	 and	 must	 say	 that	 they	 fought	 bravely,	 though	 with	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">ferocity	that	was	more	than	savage,	to	the	bitter	end,	their	last	rally	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">break	of	the	poop	being	the	fiercest	episode	of	the	fray,	several	hand-to-</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand	 combats	 going	 on	 at	 one	 and	 the	 same	 time	 with	 hand	 pikes	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">capstan	 bars	 whirling	 about	 over	 the	 heads	 of	 those	 engaged,	 where</p>
<p class="calibre1">cutlass	cuts	were	met	with	knife-thrusts	from	the	formidable	long-bladed</p>
<p class="calibre1">weapons	the	negroes	carried	in	their	hands	only	to	sheathe	them	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bodies	of	their	white	antagonists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 brain	 got	 dizzy	 as	 I	 watched	 the	 mad	 turmoil	 and	 my	 blood	 was	 at fever	heat,	taking	part	in	the	fight	too,	you	may	be	sure,	whenever	I	saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	 opening,	 and	 dealing	 a	 blow	 here	 or	 parrying	 one	 there,	 as	 chance</p>
<p class="calibre1">arose,	 with	 the	 best	 of	 them,	 young	 though	 I	 was,	 and	 totally</p>
<p class="calibre1">inexperienced	in	such	matters! </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	coming	near	to	the	finish,	being	too	warm	work	to	continue	much</p>
<p class="calibre1">longer,	and	I	think	all	of	us	had	had	pretty	well	enough	of	it,	when,	looking</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p180"></a>round	 for	 Colonel	 Vereker,	 whom	 I	 suddenly	 missed	 from	 among	 the combatants,	 I	 saw	 him	 struggling	 with	 one	 of	 the	 blacks	 in	 a	 regular</p>
<p class="calibre1">rough	and	tumble	tussle	on	the	deck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	two	were	rolling	about	close	to	the	after	skylight	from	whence	we	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">observed	 the	 flash	 of	 the	 pistol	 shot	 as	 we	 approached	 the	 ship,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	 the	 colonel	 had	 been	 trying	 to	 get	 near	 to	 ever	 since	 he	 boarded her,	 but	 had	 been	 prevented	 from	 reaching	 by	 one	 obstacle	 or	 another</p>
<p class="calibre1">until	 now,	 when	 this	 negro	 clutched	 hold	 of	 him	 and	 forced	 him	 back</p>
<p class="calibre1">again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 and	 the	 Haytian	 were	 tightly	 locked	 in	 a	 deadly	 embrace,	 the	 negro gripping	 him	 with	 both	 arms	 round	 the	 body,	 and	 the	 colonel</p>
<p class="calibre1">endeavouring	to	release	his	revolver	hand,	the	two	rolling	over	and	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	deck	towards	the	rail	forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ha!”	muttered	the	colonel,	who	was	hard	pressed,	through	his	set	teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only	let	me	get	free.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Strangely	enough,	the	glass	of	the	skylight	above	the	spot	where	the	pair</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 struggling	 was	 instantly	 shattered	 from	 within,	 as	 if	 in	 response	 to his	muttered	cry;	and	with	a	loud	bark	that	could	have	been	heard	a	mile</p>
<p class="calibre1">off,	a	big	dog	burst	forth	from	the	opening,	making	straight	for	the	colonel</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	his	relentless	foe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 there	 came	 a	 startled	 yell	 from	 the	 negro,	 who,	 releasing	 his	 late antagonist,	staggered	to	his	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Holy	name	of—”	he	screamed	out	in	wild	affright,	but	he	had	not	time	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">reach	the	concluding	word	of	his	sentence—the	name	of	his	patron	saint, </p>
<p class="calibre1">no	doubt—“the	devil!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 before	 he	 could	 get	 so	 far,	 giving	 a	 fierce	 growl,	 the	 dog	 at	 once sprang	 up	 at	 him,	 his	 fangs	 meeting	 in	 the	 Haytian’s	 throat,	 whereupon the	latter,	toppling	backwards	over	the	poop-rail,	fell	into	the	waist	below, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 the	 dog	 hanging	 on	 to	 him;	 and	 I	 noticed	 presently	 that	 both	 were dead,	 the	 brave	 animal	 who	 had	 come	 so	 opportunely	 to	 the	 rescue	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 colonel,	 his	 master,	 being	 stabbed	 to	 the	 heart	 by	 a	 knife	 which	 the negro	still	held	in	his	lifeless	hand,	while	his	own	neck	had	been	torn	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">pieces	by	the	dog	whom	death	could	not	force	to	relinquish	his	grip! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p181"></a>Immediately	running	up	to	the	colonel,	who	was	feebly	trying	to	rise,	his wrestle	with	the	black	having	crippled	his	wounded	leg	and	arm,	I	helped</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	 to	 his	 feet	 as	 quickly	 as	 I	 could,	 while	 others	 clustered	 round	 to shelter	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Poor	Ivan,	true	as	steel	in	death	as	in	life!”	he	faintly	muttered,	glancing</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	break	of	the	poop	on	the	two	bodies	huddled	together	below,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">blood	of	the	faithful	dog	flowing	with	that	of	his	ruthless	foe	into	a	crimson</p>
<p class="calibre1">pool	that	was	gradually	extending	its	borders	from	the	middle	of	the	deck</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 lee	 scuppers.	 “He	 has	 defended	 my	 little	 Elsie,	 I	 am	 sure,	 to	 the last,	likewise,	even	as	he	defended	me.	I	hope	and	trust	my	child	is	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">safe	in	the	cabin.	Help	me	aft,	my	lad,	to	see;	quick,	quick!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	course	I	assisted	him	as	well	as	I	could	under	the	circumstances,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 he	 limped	 along	 towards	 the	 companion-hatchway,	 the	 leader	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">desperadoes,	 that	 villainous	 “marquis,”	 who	 I	 thought	 had	 met	 with	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	 deserts	 long	 since,	 not	 having	 seen	 him	 for	 some	 little	 time	 among the	other	fighters,	most	unexpectedly	jumped	from	the	rigging	in	front	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	colonel	and	aimed	a	vindictive	blow	at	him	with	a	marline-spike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	must	have	settled	the	colonel	if	it	had	fallen	on	his	uncovered	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fortunately	 though,	 dropping	 quickly	 the	 colonel’s	 arm,	 I	 fended	 off	 the blow	 with	 the	 revolver	 I	 held	 in	 my	 hand,	 while	 at	 the	 same	 time	 I	 gave the	 scoundrel	 a	 drive	 in	 the	 face	 that	 must	 have	 astonished	 his	 black lordship	a	good	deal,	for	my	clenched	fist	met	him	square	on	the	mouth</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	shook	his	teeth,	making	them	rattle,	as	well	as	disarranging	the	twist</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	his	crinkly	moustache! </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 came	 at	 me	 with	 a	 snarl	 like	 an	 angry	 tiger,	 and	 then,	 hugging	 me tight,	 with	 his	 hideous	 black	 face	 thrust	 close	 against	 mine,	 and	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">muscular	arms	pressed	tightly	around	my	ribs,	he	squeezed	every	ounce</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	breath	out	of	my	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	my	last	hour	had	come. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	help	came	to	my	aid	from	a	most	unlooked-for	quarter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah!	 you	 blackguard,”	 cried	 a	 voice	 that	 sounded	 dimly	 in	 my	 ears,	 my head	at	the	time	seeming	to	be	whirling	round	like	the	arms	of	a	windmill</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	sense	of	suffocation	and	the	rush	of	blood	to	the	brain.	“Coward! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p182"></a>miscreant!	you	are	here	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Breathless	though	I	was,	I	was	so	surprised,	and	indeed	frightened	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice	and	accent	of	the	speaker,	which	I	immediately	recognised,	that	I	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">once	came	to	myself	and	opened	wide	my	half-closed	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Good	 heavens!	 Shall	 I	 ever	 forget	 the	 sight?	 Yes;	 it	 was	 Captain</p>
<p class="calibre1">Alphonse,	whom	I	had	last	seen	only	half	an	hour	or	so	previously	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">skipper’s	cot	on	board	the	 <i class="calibre4">Star	of	the	North</i>,	 when	 Garry	 O’Neil	 said	 he would	 probably	 never	 wake	 to	 consciousness	 again	 in	 this	 life,	 or	 move out	of	the	skipper’s	state	room! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here	 he	 was	 though,	 all	 the	 same,	 looking	 like	 an	 apparition	 from	 the dead,	wild,	ghastly,	awful,	but	quite	sufficiently	in	his	senses	to	recognise</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	terrible	enemy,	the	pseudo	“marquis.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	a	scene	I	shall	never	forget,	as	I	remarked	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	poor	Ivan,	and	with	equal	ferocity,	the	Frenchman	sprang	at	the	ugly</p>
<p class="calibre1">villain’s	 throat,	 the	 whole	 lot	 of	 us	 tumbling	 headlong	 on	 the	 deck</p>
<p class="calibre1">together,	 which	 caused	 the	 wretch	 to	 release	 me	 in	 order	 to	 protect</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself	 from	 Captain	 Alphonse,	 who,	 kneeling	 on	 the	 top	 of	 him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">hammered	him	against	the	bulwarks	as	though	trying	to	beat	the	life	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Making	 a	 last	 desperate	 effort,	 the	 Haytian	 “marquis”	 gripped	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">antagonist	 round	 the	 waist	 as	 he	 previously	 gripped	 me,	 dragging	 him</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	 beside	 him	 again;	 and	 then,	 as	 the	 two	 came	 with	 all	 their	 might against	 the	 side	 of	 the	 ship	 where	 the	 port	 flap	 was	 loose,	 the	 whole	 of the	 planking	 gave	 way,	 and	 poor	 Captain	 Alphonse,	 with	 that	 scoundrel</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	black	“marquis,”	crashed	through	the	splintering	wood	together,	falling</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	a	heavy	splash	overboard	into	the	sea	beneath,	going	to	the	bottom</p>
<p class="calibre1">locked	 in	 each	 other’s	 arms—a	 terrible	 ending	 to	 the	 terrible	 episode	 of this,	their	last	meeting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 the	 minute	 the	 colonel	 seemed	 overwhelmed	 with	 grief	 at	 this	 awful and	sudden	termination	of	poor	Captain	Alphonse’s	life,	and	we	would	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">sooner	 have	 seen	 him	 die	 unconsciously	 if	 not	 quietly,	 in	 his	 bed;	 but such	are	the	ways	of	Providence,	and	we	cannot	control	them! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p183"></a>But	this	day	certainly	witnessed	a	series	of	surprises,	so	it	seemed	to	me, the	most	wonderful	things	happening	every	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Colonel	 Vereker	 had	 dragged	 himself	 as	 well	 as	 he	 could	 up	 to	 where	 I lay	 on	 the	 deck,	 after	 being	 set	 free	 from	 the	 bearlike	 hug	 of	 the	 negro, helping	me	up	on	my	legs	in	the	same	Good	Samaritan	way	in	the	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	saved	him	shortly	before;	and	we	were	both	looking	over	the	side, </p>
<p class="calibre1">talking	excitedly	of	the	dreadful	catastrophe	that	had	just	happened,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">wondering	 whether	 the	 poor	 captain’s	 body	 would	 rise	 to	 the	 surface</p>
<p class="calibre1">again,	 when	 all	 of	 a	 sudden,	 something	 bright	 crossing	 the	 deck	 caught my	 eye	 like	 a	 flash	 of	 light,	 and	 I	 heard	 the	 sound	 of	 light	 and	 hurried footsteps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wheeling	round	hastily	I	was	amazed	at	the	beautiful	object	that	met	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">gaze,	for	I	saw	standing	there,	only	a	pace	or	two	off,	a	lovely	young	girl, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with	a	profusion	of	long	silky	hair	of	a	bright	golden	hue,	that	streamed	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 tangled	 mass	 over	 her	 shoulders,	 and	 reaching	 down	 almost	 to	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	father,	my	dear	father!”	she	exclaimed	in	broken	and	ecstatic	tones, </p>
<p class="calibre1">her	voice	sounding	to	me	like	the	soft	cooing	of	a	dove,	as	she	flew	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">nestled	 herself	 into	 the	 outstretched	 arms	 of	 the	 colonel,	 who	 had	 also turned	 round	 at	 her	 approach,	 some	 sympathetic	 feeling	 having	 warned</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	of	her	coming,	telling	him	who	it	was	even	before	he	saw	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	my	father!	my	father!	At	last,	at	last!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then,	 unable	 to	 control	 herself	 longer,	 she	 burst	 into	 a	 passion	 of tears	and	sobs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Colonel	Vereker,	on	his	part,	was	equally	overcome. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“God	be	thanked!”	cried	he,	raising	his	face	to	heaven,	clasping	her	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same	 time	 fondly	 to	 his	 heart	 and	 kissing	 her	 trembling	 lips	 again	 and again.	“My	darling	one,	my	own	little	daughter,	whom	I	thought	I	had	lost</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	ever,	but	whom	the	good	God	has	preserved	to	be	the	delight	of	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes	again,	my	little	one,	my	precious!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 a	 few	 minutes	 I	 too	 had	 a	 lump	 in	 my	 throat,	 but	 turned	 aside,	 and then,	 not	 wishing	 to	 appear	 to	 be	 observing	 them,	 I	 left	 them	 alone	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p184"></a>went	off	to	another	part	of	the	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Twenty	Five. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Hors	de	Combat. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 grand	 hurrah	 just	 then	 burst	 forth	 from	 the	 deck	 below	 us,	 where	 the skipper	 and	 most	 of	 the	 men	 were	 massed,	 telling	 as	 plainly	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">triumphant	cheer	could	tell,	that	the	fight	was	ended	and	that	victory	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">crowned	our	arms	with	success.	I	rushed	back	to	tell	the	colonel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 hearing	 my	 footsteps,	 however,	 little	 Elsie	 turned	 round	 and	 caught</p>
<p class="calibre1">sight	of	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	my	father!”	said	she,	untwining	herself	from	the	colonel’s	embrace, </p>
<p class="calibre1">though	she	still	nestled	up	close	to	him,	as	she	stared	at	me	shyly,	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">puzzled	 look	 on	 her	 mignonne	 face.	 “Why,	 who	 is	 this	 young	 sir,	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">father?	I	seem	to	know	him,	and	yet	I	do	not	remember	having	ever	seen</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	before!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look	at	him	again,	darling	one,”	said	her	father,	petting	her	caressingly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">while	 another	 hearty	 cheer	 went	 up	 from	 the	 hands	 in	 the	 waist.	 “He	 is Señor	 Dick	 Haldane,	 a	 gallant	 young	 gentleman	 whom	 you	 must	 thank, </p>
<p class="calibre1">my	little	daughter,	for	having	saved	my	life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 this	 the	 graceful	 young	 girl	 advanced	 a	 step	 or	 two	 towards	 me,	 and catching	hold	of	my	hand,	before	I	could	prevent	her,	kissed	it,	greatly	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 confusion;	 as	 albeit	 it	 was	 an	 act	 expressive	 amongst	 the	 Spanish</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 whom	 she	 had	 been	 brought	 up,	 of	 deferential	 courtesy	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">gratitude,	but	it	made	me	blush	up	to	my	eyes	and	feel	hot	all	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	 thousand	 thanks,	 sir,”	 she	 began;	 but	 as	 she	 raised	 her	 eyes	 to	 my face	in	thus	giving	utterance	to	her	thanks	for	having,	as	the	colonel	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">told	 her,	 saved	 her	 father’s	 life,	 a	 flood	 of	 recollection	 seemed	 to	 come upon	her,	and	she	exclaimed:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	 I	 remember	 now!	 My	 father,	 yes,	 he	 is	 like	 the	 gentleman	 whom	 I saw	on	the	deck	of	the	steamer	that	awful	night	when	the	negroes	rose</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p185"></a>up	 against	 us—last	 Friday,	 was	 it	 not?	 But	 it	 seems	 so	 long	 ago	 to	 me! </p>
<p class="calibre1">You,	 you	 naughty	 papa,	 would	 not	 believe	 that	 your	 little	 girl	 had	 seen anything	 at	 all,	 not	 even	 a	 ship,	 but	 that	 I	 only	 fancied	 it	 in	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">foolishness.	However,	there	is	the	same	steamer	that	I	saw	(pointing	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	finger	to	the	 <i class="calibre4">Star	of	the	North</i>),	and	here	is	the	same,	for	I	am	sure	he is	the	same,	the	very	same	young	officer.	Am	I	not	right?”	And	looking	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	her	father,	she	exclaimed,	“Your	little	girl	told	the	truth	after	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 you,	 young	 lady,”	 said	 I,	 smiling	 at	 her	 recognition	 of	 me,	 strange coincidence	 as	 it	 was,	 corroborating	 my	 own	 experience	 of	 the	 same</p>
<p class="calibre1">eventful	night,	“yes;	you	are	the	same	little	girl	I	saw	on	board	the	‘ghost-</p>
<p class="calibre1">ship,’	as	all	the	men	here	called	your	vessel,	not	believing,	likewise,	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">story	 that	 I	 had	 seen	 her	 or	 you	 either.	 Yes,	 I	 would	 have	 known	 you anywhere.	You	are	the	girl	whom	I	saw	with	the	dog!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 next	 moment	 I	 could	 have	 bitten	 my	 tongue	 out,	 though,	 for	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughtlessness	 in	 alluding	 to	 the	 poor	 dog;	 for	 at	 the	 bare	 mention	 of him	Elsie’s	face,	which	had	a	sort	of	absent,	wandering	look	about	it	still, </p>
<p class="calibre1">at	once	lighted	up,	and	she	glanced	round	in	all	directions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	 I	 declare	 I	 had	 quite	 forgotten	 Ivan	 in	 the	 joy	 and	 happiness	 of seeing	you	again,	my	father,”	she	exclaimed	excitedly.	“Where	is	he,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">brave	 fellow?	 Ivan,	 Ivan,	 you	 dear	 old	 dog.	 Come	 here;	 come	 here,	 sir, directly!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 looked	 round	 again,	 with	 a	 half	 smile	 playing	 about	 the	 corners	 of her	 pretty	 rosebud	 of	 a	 mouth	 and	 a	 joyous	 light	 in	 her	 eyes,	 expecting her	 faithful	 friend	 and	 companion	 would	 come	 bounding	 up	 to	 her	 side; </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 she	 now	 waited	 and	 watched	 and	 listened	 in	 vain,	 there	 being	 no</p>
<p class="calibre1">response	to	her	summons	either	by	bark	or	bound	or	wag	of	poor	Ivan’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">bushy	tail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nor	would	there	be	any	more,	for	his	ringing	bark	was	hushed,	his	body</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	tail	alike	stiff	and	cold,	while	his	noble	heart	which	only	throbbed	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">affection	 for	 those	 whom	 he	 loved	 when	 living,	 had	 stopped	 beating	 for aye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	dear	child,	poor	Ivan	is	dead!”	said	Colonel	Vereker	tenderly	after	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">short	pause,	drawing	the	young	girl	up	to	him	so	that	she	might	not	see</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p186"></a>the	gruesome	sight	on	the	deck	below.	“The	brave	dog	sacrificed	his	life for	mine,	and	but	for	his	help,	little	one,	I	should	not	now	be	by	your	side.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 account	 of	 the	 poor	 animal’s	 heroic	 end,	 however,	 did	 not	 comfort little	Elsie,	who	gave	a	startled	glance	at	her	father’s	face;	where,	seeing</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	 there	 that	 made	 her	 comprehend	 her	 loss,	 she	 buried	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">golden	head	on	his	breast,	sobbing	as	though	her	heart	would	break. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Poor,	poor,	dear	Ivan;	he	never	left	me	once,	never,	my	father,	since	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">—you	went	out	of	the	cabin	that	last	night	and	told	him	to	watch	me!”	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">exclaimed	 presently,	 in	 halting	 accents	 between	 her	 convulsive	 sobs, </p>
<p class="calibre1">neither	the	colonel	or	myself	dry-eyed	as	we	listened	to	her	tale,	you	may</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	sure.	“But—but	all	at	once,	after	all	the	noise	and	that	dreadful	firing</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 seems	 now	 to	 go	 through	 my	 ears,	 I—I	 heard	 your	 voice	 quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">distinctly	on	the	deck;	and	so,	too,	did	poor	Ivan,	for	I	saw	him	instantly</p>
<p class="calibre1">put	up	his	ears,	while	he	whined	and	looked	beseechingly	at	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 after	 that,	 my	 child,”	 said	 the	 colonel,	 on	 her	 stopping	 for	 the moment,	overcome	with	emotion,	“what	happened	next?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	 made	 a	 dash	 at	 the	 cabin	 table	 and	 jumped	 up	 on	 it,	 and	 then	 the poor	 fellow	 growled	 savagely	 at	 some	 one	 outside.	 Then—then	 before	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	hold	him	back	he	made	a	most	desperate	spring	and	sprung	right</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	 through	 the	 glass	 roof	 on	 the	 top	 of	 the	 sky—skylight,	 and	 he	 must have	cut	himself	very	very	much.	Poor,	poor	doggie!	And	now	you	say	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">poor	 Ivan	 is	 dead,	 and	 that	 I	 shall	 never	 see	 the	 dear	 good	 faithful creature	again.	Oh,	my	father!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	this	point	the	young	girl	again	broke	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nor	were	her	tears	a	mere	passing	tribute	of	grief.	For,	though	dead,	Ivan</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 not	 forgotten,	 like	 some	 people,	 the	 remembrance	 of	 whom	 is	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">evanescent	 as	 the	 scent	 of	 the	 flowers	 that	 hypocritical	 mourners	 may</p>
<p class="calibre1">ostentatiously	scatter	upon	their	graves;	his	little	mistress,	little	no	longer, </p>
<p class="calibre1">preserving	 his	 memory	 yet	 green	 in	 her	 heart	 of	 hearts,	 close	 to	 which she	wears	always	a	small	locket	containing	likenesses	of	her	father	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother,	together	with	a	miniature	of	Ivan—her	father’s	preserver—with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">tiny	lock	added	from	the	brave	dog’s	curly	black	coat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	 ultra-sanctimonious	 persons	 may	 feel	 inclined	 to	 cavil	 with	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p187"></a>association	 on	 Elsie’s	 part	 of	 “immortal	 beings,”	 as	 they	 would	 style	 her parents,	 and	 the	 recollection	 she	 cherishes	 of	 a	 “dead	 brute,”	 because, forsooth,	 they	 hold	 that	 her	 four-footed	 favourite	 had	 no	 soul;	 but	 were these	 gentry	 to	 broach	 the	 subject	 before	 her,	 being	 a	 somewhat</p>
<p class="calibre1">outspoken	 young	 lady	 from	 her	 foreign	 bringing	 up,	 which	 puts	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">beyond	the	pale	of	boarding-school	punctiliousness,	she	would	probably</p>
<p class="calibre1">urge	that	she	estimated	poor	Ivan’s	sagacious	instinct	combined	with	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">courage	 and	 noble	 self-sacrifice,	 at	 a	 far	 higher	 level	 than	 the	 paltry apology	for	a	soul	that	passes	current	for	the	genuine	article	with	matter-of-fact	religionists	of	the	stamp	of	her	questioner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Elsie	was	“little	Elsie”	still,	at	the	time	of	which	I	am	speaking,	and	too</p>
<p class="calibre1">young,	 perhaps,	 for	 such	 thoughts	 to	 occur	 to	 her	 mind,	 which	 at	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment	was	too	full	of	her	loss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cheering	that	had	followed	the	last	tussle	of	our	men	with	the	black</p>
<p class="calibre1">mutineers	 had	 now	 ceased,	 and	 all	 these	 things	 happening,	 you	 must</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand,	 much	 more	 rapidly	 than	 I	 can	 talk	 or	 attempt	 to	 chronicle</p>
<p class="calibre1">them,	the	skipper,	with	Mr	Fosset	and	Garry	O’Neil,	came	hurriedly	up	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	poop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both	expressed	their	unbounded	delight	at	seeing	the	child	was	safe	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	care	of	her	father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sure,	 an’	 what’s	 the	 little	 colleen	 cryin’	 for?	 eagerly	 inquired	 Garry,	 his smoke-begrimed	 face,	 which	 bore	 ample	 evidence	 of	 the	 desperate</p>
<p class="calibre1">struggle	 in	 which	 he	 had	 been	 so	 gallantly	 engaged,	 wearing	 a	 look	 of deep	commiseration	as	he	gazed	from	her	father	to	me,	and	then	again</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	her.	“Faith,	I	hope	she’s	not	been	hurt	or	frightened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 thank	 God!”	 replied	 the	 colonel	 huskily.	 “Grieving	 for	 her	 poor	 dog Ivan,	who—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Och	 yes,	 I	 saw	 the	 noble	 baste,”	 interrupted	 Garry	 in	 his	 quick, </p>
<p class="calibre1">enthusiastic	 way.	 “Begorrah,	 colonel,	 he	 fought	 betther	 than	 any	 two-</p>
<p class="calibre1">legged	Christian	amongst	us,	an’	I	can’t	say	more	than	that	for	him,	sure, </p>
<p class="calibre1">paice	to	his	name!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	he	could	say	anything	further,	and	you	know	he	was	a	rare	one	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">talk	when	once	he	commenced,	the	skipper	advanced	again,	holding	out</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p188"></a>his	hand	to	the	colonel	exclaiming—	“Yes,	thank	God	you	are	all	right	and that	 your	 little	 child	 is	 safe,	 and	 escaped	 any	 harm	 from	 those</p>
<p class="calibre1">scoundrels,	except	her	nerves	probably	being	much	shaken,	but	that	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	 soon	 recover	 at	 her	 age—and	 I	 told	 you	 she	 should	 be	 restored	 to you,	 you	 know.	 By	 George!	 Though,	 we’ve	 paid	 them	 out	 at	 last	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1">demon’s	work	aboard	here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	devils!”	ejaculated	Colonel	Vereker	savagely,	his	mood	changing	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 recollected	 all	 he	 had	 seen	 and	 suffered	 at	 their	 hands.	 “Have	 you killed	them	all?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	 but	 half	 a	 dozen	 of	 the	 rascals,	 whom	 we	 had	 a	 rare	 hunt	 after through	the	hold	and	fo’c’s’le	before	we	could	collar	them.	They	are	fast</p>
<p class="calibre1">bound	now,	though,	lashed	head	and	feet	to	the	mainmast	bitts;	and	it	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">puzzle	 them	 to	 wriggle	 themselves	 loose	 from	 old	 Masters’	 double</p>
<p class="calibre1">hitches,	I	know.	Besides	which,	two	of	our	men	are	guarding	there,	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">boarding-pikes	in	their	hands	and	orders	to	run	’em	through	the	gizzard	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	offer	to	stir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith,”	 observed	 Garry	 O’Neil	 reflectively,	 “It	 was	 as	 purty	 a	 bit	 of foighting	as	I	ivver	took	a	hand	in,	whilst	it	lasted!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 let	 us	 go	 and	 see	 what	 has	 become	 of	 all	 those	 chaps	 below—all</p>
<p class="calibre1">those	you	mentioned	as	belonging	to	the	French	crew,	whom	you	left	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">board	 with	 your	 daughter,”	 went	 on	 the	 skipper.	 “We	 saw	 the	 flash	 of	 a pistol,	you	remember,	when	we	came	up	alongside,	and	somebody	must</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	prevented	those	villains	from	getting	into	the	cabin,	or	else—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stopped	here	and	looked	meaningly	at	Elsie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Heavens!”	exclaimed	the	colonel,	attempting	to	rise,	but	falling	back	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 hen-coop	 along	 the	 side	 of	 the	 bulwarks	 he	 had	 been	 using	 for	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">temporary	 seat,	 he	 seemed	 so	 utterly	 exhausted.	 “Ah,	 those	 brave</p>
<p class="calibre1">fellows,	I	was	almost	forgetting	them;	but	I	can’t	move,	Señor	Applegarth, </p>
<p class="calibre1">or	 I	 should	 have	 gone	 down	 before	 this	 to	 see	 what	 had	 become	 of	 my old	comrades;	but	I’m	helpless,	as	you	see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elsie	now	lifted	her	head,	looked	up	and	turned	towards	the	skipper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	are	all	wounded,”	said	she,	clasping	her	hands	together	and	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p189"></a>look	of	fright	on	her	face.	“Two	of	the	men—the	French	sailors,	I	mean—</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	the	English	gentleman.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	the	little	Britisher	I	told	you	about,	who	was	so	plucky,”	explained</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	colonel—“Mr	Johnson.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	my	father,”	continued	the	young	girl,	“these	three	rushed	down	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">stairs	into	the	cabin,	shortly	before	the	steamer	thumped	against	the	side</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	our	ship,	when	I	thought	we	were	all	going	down	to	the	bottom	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 my	 child,”	 said	 the	 colonel	 encouragingly,	 “go	 on	 and	 tell	 us	 what happened	next.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 English	 gentleman	 spoke	 to	 me	 and	 said	 that	 the	 terrible	 negroes</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	conquered	them	all	on	deck,	but	that	he	and	the	two	Frenchmen	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">escaped	 from	 them	 in	 time,	 and	 were	 going	 to	 barricade	 the	 doorway</p>
<p class="calibre1">leading	 down	 from	 above	 to	 prevent	 the	 black	 men	 from	 coming	 below</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	murdering	us	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	 told	 me,	 though,	 did	 the	 kind	 English	 gentleman,	 that	 I	 must	 not	 be frightened	and	all	would	come	right	in	the	end,	for	that	they	had	seen	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	large	steamer	approaching,	coming	quite	close	to	us,	and	that	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 be	 able,	 he	 thought,	 to	 hold	 out	 until	 we	 were	 all	 rescued.	 They then	 piled	 up	 heaps	 and	 heaps	 of	 things	 against	 the	 door	 at	 the	 foot	 of the	stairs	where	the	sailors	remained;	then	the	Englishman	stood	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">table,	under	the	skylight,	to	keep	the	negroes	from	getting	through	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	the	Englishman	who	fired	at	them	through	the	glass,	for	he	was	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	one	who	had	a	pistol,	and	he	made	a	hole	and	then	through	that	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">heard	 all	 the	 shrieks	 and	 the	 noise	 of	 the	 pistols;	 and	 your	 voice,	 my father,	 Ivan	 heard,	 and	 then	 he	 jumped	 up	 through	 the	 hole,	 making	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	bigger	one,	and	ran	to	your	rescue,	my	dear,	dear	father.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 what	 has	 become	 of	 Monsieur	 Boisson,	 and	 Madame	 all	 this	 time; </p>
<p class="calibre1">where	 were	 they?”	 asked	 the	 colonel,	 on	 Elsie	 thus	 concluding	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">account	 of	 what	 had	 occurred	 under	 her	 immediate	 notice,	 a	 little	 sob</p>
<p class="calibre1">escaping	her	involuntarily	at	the	mention	of	her	poor	dog’s	name,	and	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	recollection	of	what	she	had	just	witnessed.	“Did	they	do	anything,	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">dear	child	to	help	themselves,	or	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p190"></a>“No,	my	father,”	she	replied,	apparently	surprised	at	the	question.	“They are	 still	 in	 the	 big	 cabin	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 saloon	 where	 you	 left	 them when	 you	 went	 away,	 and,	 I’m	 afraid	 they	 are	 very	 ill	 indeed,	 for	 all	 the time	 the	 firing	 was	 going	 on	 overhead	 Madame	 was	 screeching	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">screaming,	 and	 I	 am	 sure	 I	 heard	 Monsieur	 groaning	 a	 good	 deal.	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 doing	 so	 again	 just	 now,	 before	 I	 found	 my	 way	 upstairs	 to	 you,	 to find	 you,	 and	 to	 see	 what	 had	 happened,	 everything	 had	 become	 so</p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly	still	after	all	the	noise,	and—and—those—awful	horrible	yells	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	negroes—oh!	I—I—can	hear	them	still!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 turned	 quite	 pale	 when	 uttering	 the	 last	 words,	 words	 spoken	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">visible	effort,	shuddering	all	over	and	hiding	her	face	again	on	her	father’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith,	 sor,	 don’t	 ask	 her	 any	 more	 questions,”	 cried	 Garry,	 “but	 we’d betther	be	sayin’	afther	those	poor	fellows	ourselves,	an’	at	once,	too!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	 quickly,	 sir	 doctor,”	 said	 the	 colonel,	 “and	 I	 only	 wish	 I	 could	 come with	you!	but—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	jist	you	shtop	where	ye	are,	me	friend,”	rejoined	Garry,	putting	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 hand	 to	 prevent	 his	 stirring	 from	 his	 seat.	 “Sure	 the	 cap’en	 an’	 me, with	Dick	Haldane	here,	will	be	enough	to	look	afther	’em	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	this	he	made	for	the	companion-way	and	descended	the	“stairs,”	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Elsie,	 ignorant	 of	 nautical	 nomenclature,	 called	 the	 ladder,	 the	 skipper following	close	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 getting	 to	 the	 bottom	 we	 found	 the	 panels	 of	 the	 door	 smashed	 in, though	 of	 hard	 oak,	 strengthened	 with	 cross	 battens	 of	 the	 same	 stout</p>
<p class="calibre1">wood,	 which	 showed	 to	 what	 fierce	 assault	 it	 had	 been	 subjected,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">furniture	piled	up	against	it	from	within	having	duly	prevented	the	negroes</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	finally	forcing	an	entrance,	as	well,	no	doubt,	as	our	appearance	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	scene. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	barricade	had,	however,	been	now	partly	removed,	probably	to	allow</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 little	 Elsie’s	 exit,	 and,	 quickly	 pitching	 the	 remaining	 obstacles	 aside, the	 three	 of	 us	 managed	 to	 squeeze	 ourselves	 inside	 the	 cabin,	 which</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	in	such	a	state	of	confusion,	with	the	long	table	overturned	to	serve</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 a	 breastwork	 for	 the	 gallant	 defenders	 and	 the	 settees	 and	 lockers</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p191"></a>turned	 away	 from	 the	 deck,	 as	 well	 as	 the	 glass	 of	 the	 skylight	 all smashed,	that	it	looked	like	a	veritable	“Hurrah’s	vest”	as	we	sailors	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 a	 pile	 of	 cushions	 belonging	 to	 the	 lounge	 aft—the	 only	 piece	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">furniture	 that	 was	 left	 intact	 in	 the	 place,	 I	 believe—lay	 the	 brave	 men who	had	stubbornly	held	the	ship	to	the	last	against	the	mutineers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 were	 covered	 with	 blood	 and	 blackened	 by	 powder	 and	 so	 utterly</p>
<p class="calibre1">worn	 out	 from	 fatigue	 in	 battling	 throughout	 the	 night	 and	 day	 that	 had almost	elapsed	since	the	colonel	had	left	them,	besides	being	crippled	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	injuries	they	had	received	in	the	fray,	that	they	hardly	moved	on	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">entrance,	though	one—a	little	chap	whom	I	judged	to	be	the	Englishman</p>
<p class="calibre1">spoken	of	by	the	colonel	and	Elsie—brightened	up	as	we	bent	over	him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 look	 of	 satisfaction	 and	 content	 stealing	 over	 his	 drawn	 and	 haggard face,	 as	 we	 cauld	 see	 from	 the	 rays	 of	 the	 setting	 sun	 streaming	 down through	the	broken	skylight,	exposing	the	utter	desolation	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	the	first	to	speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	afeard	you’ve	come	too	late	for	us,	sirs,”	said	he	slowly,	with	a	deep</p>
<p class="calibre1">groan	 of	 pain.	 “Those	 damned	 niggers	 have	 done	 for	 me,	 one	 of	 them</p>
<p class="calibre1">giving	 me	 a	 dig	 of	 his	 knife	 in	 the	 ribs—did	 it	 through	 the	 doorway	 just now,	when	the	fight	were	nearly	over.	You	might	do	summat,	though,	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	companions	here,	who	stood	up	to	the	darkies	like	Britons,	in	spite	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	 being	 only	 Frenchmen,	 though	 that	 ain’t	 their	 fault.	 But	 how’s	 the little	 girl?	 I	 hope	 she’s	 all	 right.	 Tell	 her	 father,	 if	 he’s	 alive—and	 I	 feel almost	sure	I	heard	his	voice	awhile	ago	up	on	deck—tell	him	that	I	kept</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	word,	sirs,	and	fought	for	her	to	the	last.	I	think	I’m	dying	now,	and—I</p>
<p class="calibre1">—must—leave—off.	 But	 listen	 while	 I’ve	 a	 little	 breath,	 for	 I	 want	 to	 say something.	 My	 name	 is	 Robert	 Johnson,	 and	 my	 old	 mother,	 God	 bless</p>
<p class="calibre1">her,	 lives	 at	 Camberwell,	 near	 London.	 You’ll	 find	 all	 my	 papers	 in	 my pocket	 and	 a	 letter	 with	 the	 address,	 and	 if	 any	 of	 you	 chances	 to	 be going	back	to	England	as	I	were,	worse	luck,	you’d	be	doing	a	favour	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">seein’	her	and	letting	her	know	why	I	didn’t	turn	up	home	this	Christmas</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	I	promised	her.	I	know	you	will.	I’m	going	now,	I’m	so	tired.	Good-night</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	you	all—good-night—good—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 he	 said	 this	 he	 gradually	 fell	 back	 on	 the	 cushion	 he	 was	 resting against,	and	his	eyes	closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p192"></a>Captain	Applegarth	and	I	both	thought	him	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	so,	however,	Garry	O’Neil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,	 he’s	 ounly	 fainted,”	 exclaimed	 the	 Irishman;	 “run,	 Dick,	 me	 bhoy, an’	 say	 if	 there’s	 sich	 a	 thing	 as	 a	 stooard’s	 pantry	 knockin’	 about</p>
<p class="calibre1">anywheres	in	those	latituodes,	wid	a	dhrop	of	water	convanient.	That	an’</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 taste	 of	 this	  <i class="calibre4">aqua	 vitae</i>	 here,	 which,	 the	 saints	 be	 praised,	 I	 took	 the precawshin	 to	 put	 in	 me	 pocket	 afore	 we	 shtarted	 on	 this	 blissid	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">excoitin’	 skermoish,	 this	 will	 very	 soon	 fetch	 back	 a	 little	 loife	 into	 the plucky	little	beggar	ag’in!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	no	difficulty	in	finding	the	steward’s	pantry	and	a	breaker	of	water, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with	a	tin	dipper	attached,	speedily	carrying	some	back	and,	by	our	joint</p>
<p class="calibre1">ministrations,	 and	 with	 it	 bathing	 his	 face	 and	 hands	 and	 pouring	 some between	his	lips,	little	Mr	Johnson	at	last	opened	his	eyes	and	began	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">breathe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	time	and	a	certain	amount	of	patience	he	opened	his	eyes	wider, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 became	 conscious,	 and	 later	 on	 was	 induced	 to	 swallow	 down	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">mixture	 out	 of	 his	 own	 special	 bottle	 that	 Garry	 carried,	 and	 we	 were	 at last	 delighted	 to	 see	 quite	 a	 broad	 grin	 spread	 over	 his	 round	 good-natured	and	somewhat	comical	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	 Jingo,	 sir!”	 said	 he,	 after	 a	 pause	 and	 rather	 long	 silence,	 and	 after he	had	drained	off	the	last	drop	of	the	elixir,	with	a	sigh	of	gratitude	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">evidently	 came	 from	 his	 heart,	 “you’ve	 saved	 my	 life	 this	 time,	 and	 no mistake.	 I	 never	 thought	 I	 should	 taste	 a	 drop	 of	 good	 brandy	 again	 in this	world.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Twenty	Six. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">We	part	Company. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">While	 Garry	 O’Neil	 and	 I	 were	 attending	 to	 the	 two	 French	 sailors	 who, though	 they	 had	 been	 a	 good	 bit	 knocked	 about	 in	 the	 course	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">protracted	 struggle,	 were	 not	 seemingly	 very	 seriously	 hurt,	 suffering</p>
<p class="calibre1">more,	 indeed,	 from	 want	 of	 proper	 food	 and	 rest	 than	 from	 the	 slight</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p193"></a>wounds	 they	 had	 received,	 we	 heard	 loud	 cries	 and	 a	 sort	 of	 dull moaning	that	appeared	to	proceed	from	the	after	part	of	the	saloon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Going	 thither	 at	 once,	 Captain	 Applegarth	 knocked	 with	 his	 knuckles	 on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 panel	 of	 the	 closed	 door	 of	 one	 of	 the	 larger	 state	 rooms,	 running athwart	the	ship	from	whence	the	sounds	proceeded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hullo,	 within	 there!”	 he	 shouted,	 “what’s	 the	 matter?	 What’s	 the	 row? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Come	out!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	shrill	scream	was	the	only	response	to	his	inquiries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	 the	 matter?”	 repeated	 the	 skipper,	 speaking	 in	 a	 gentler	 tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	have	nothing	to	fear.	We’re	all	friends	here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 cries	 and	 confused	 noises	 continued,	 however,	 and	 the	 skipper</p>
<p class="calibre1">thereupon	 resumed	 his	 knocking,	 this	 time	 more	 forcibly,	 and	 with	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">fists	aided	by	a	kick	from	his	heavy	boot	against	the	lower	part	of	the	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">closed	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	this	imperative	summons	the	shrieking	ceased,	and	we	heard	a	feeble</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice	 within,	 calling	 out	 in	 French—	 “Mercy!	 for	 the	 love	 of	 God!”	 we could	 distinguish	 amidst	 a	 plentitude	 of	 sobs	 and	 violent	 groans	 in	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">deeper	key.	“Ah!	brave	Haytians!	Have	pity,	and	spare	our	lives!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hang	 it	 all,	 you	 cowards,	 we’re	  <i class="calibre4">not</i>	 those	 cursed	 Haytians,	 and	 I	 wish you	 could	 have	 been	 left	 to	 their	 mercy!	 It	 is	 only	 what	 you	 deserve!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">roared	 the	 skipper,	 infuriated	 and	 out	 of	 all	 patience	 at	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Frenchwoman’s	 mistake	 and	 her	 appealing	 in	 such	 terms	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">murderous	 scoundrels	 of	 whom	 we	 had	 made	 so	 summary	 an	 end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	 Englishmen;	 we’re	 your	 friends,	 I	 tell	 you,	 true-hearted	 British</p>
<p class="calibre1">sailors,	who	have	come	to	rescue	you,	so	open	the	door!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 Madame	 Boisson,	 who,	 of	 course,	 was	 his	 interlocutrice	 behind	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">door,	remained	obdurate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah!	the	false	English,”	she	cried,	“down	with	the	pigs!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	this	the	skipper	laughed	grimly,	and	all	standing	near	him	were	much</p>
<p class="calibre1">amused. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p194"></a>“She’s	 a	 good	 specimen	 of	 her	 race,”	 cried	 the	 captain.	 “They	 always abuse	 other	 nations	 and	 cry	 out	 that	 they	 are	 betrayed	 when	 ill	 luck</p>
<p class="calibre1">comes	 to	 them,	 instead	 of	 trying	 to	 help	 themselves,	 as	 we	 perfidious</p>
<p class="calibre1">Englishmen	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finding	 it	 impossible	 to	 persuade	 her,	 though,	 to	 open	 the	 door	 of	 the cabin,	which	was	bolted	and	barred	within,	the	skipper	sang	out	to	me	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">go	on	deck	and	ask	Elsie	Vereker	to	come	down	and	try	what	she	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">do,	 thinking	 that	 the	 obstinate	 prisoner	 would	 doubtless	 recognise	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">girl’s	 voice	 and	 so,	 through	 her	 means,	 be	 made	 more	 amenable	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">reason. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	sooner	said	than	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Up	 I	 went	 and	 down	 the	 companion-way.	 I	 returned	 anon	 accompanied</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 only	 by	 Miss	 Elsie,	 but	 by	 the	 colonel	 as	 well,	 Garry	 O’Neil,	 who hurried	 up	 the	 ladder	 after	 me	 with	 that	 intent,	 insisting	 on	 his	 coming below	 so	 that	 he	 could	 the	 better	 attend	 to	 his	 wounded	 leg,	 which	 had broken	 out	 again	 and	 needed	 fresh	 dressing,	 and	 after	 some	 little</p>
<p class="calibre1">difficulty	Garry	got	him	down	in	safety. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thanks	 to	 Elsie’s	 pleadings,	 Madame	 Boisson	 at	 length	 capitulated, </p>
<p class="calibre1">promising	 to	 come	 out	 of	 her	 retreat	 as	 soon	 as	 she	 had	 had	 time,	 “to make	her	toilet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	George!”	exclaimed	the	skipper,	overhearing	this	and	turning	with	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">ironical	 grin	 to	 the	 colonel,	 who	 had	 his	 leg	 upon	 a	 chair,	 and	 Garry bustling	about	him,	busy	with	bandages,	“she’s	a	true	Frenchwoman,	as	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	at	the	first.	Fancy,	after	being	imprisoned	there	in	that	stuffy	cabin	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">four	 and	 twenty	 hours	 and	 imagining	 herself	 and	 husband	 might	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">murdered	 every	 minute	 by	 a	 lot	 of	 pirate	 scoundrels,	 thinking	 of	 nothing but	titifying	herself,	instead	of	thanking	God	for	their	escape	and	rushing</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	at	the	very	first	opportunity,	eager	to	be	free.	Strange	creatures!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Heavens!”	 exclaimed	 the	 colonel,	 smiling	 at	 the	 other’s	 outburst.	 “It	 is true,	but	they’re	all	alike,	and	I’ve	seen	a	good	many	of	them,	my	friend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Presently	out	sailed	Madame	Boisson,	who	I	noticed	was	a	middle-aged</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	well-preserved	woman,	attired	in	an	elaborate	dressing	gown	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">profusion	of	bows	and	ribbons	fluttering	about	it,	and	with	a	good	deal	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p195"></a>pearl	 powder	 or	 some	 other	 cosmetic	 of	 that	 sort	 on	 her	 face,	 and	 her cheeks	tinted	here	and	there	with—well,	colour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	her	screams	and	hysterics,	however,	there	was	no	trace	of	a	tear</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 her	 twinkling	 black	 eyes,	 although	 her	 fat	 little	 husband,	 who	 ambled meekly	 in	 her	 train,	 betrayed	 signs	 of	 great	 emotion,	 his	 red	 face	 all swollen	from	crying,	and	otherwise	looking	like	a	whipped	cur. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Madame	made	a	most	gracious	salute	to	us	all,	and,	glancing	at	me	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	spice	of	coquetry,	to	which	she	was	evidently	not	unaccustomed,	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleased	to	observe,	that	I	was	“<i class="calibre4">un	beau	garçon</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 returning	 the	 skipper’s	 polite	 bow	 she	 happened	 to	 notice	 the	 poor</p>
<p class="calibre1">wounded	sailors	lying	on	the	cushions	by	the	companion,	and	the	blood</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	 sprinkled	 about—a	 sight	 at	 which	 she	 turned	 up	 her	 nose,	 declaring very	volubly	that	the	place	was	like	a	“pigsty,”	unfit	for	any	lady	to	enter, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	expressing	her	surprise	at	those	“common	seamen”	being	attended</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 and	 allowed	 to	 remain	 in	 the	 saloon,	 she	 having	 always	 understood</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	that	apartment	was	only	for	“the	use	of	the	first-class	passengers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	skipper,	who	understood	her	well	enough,	as	I	did	too,	having	learnt</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 language	 at	 a	 French	 school	 near	 Rouen,	 was	 very	 angry	 at	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">remarks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Those	men,”	said	he	in	his	best	Parisian,	“are	your	own	countrymen,	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 are	 left	 of	 those	 who	 died	 to	 preserve	 the	 lives	 of	 you	 and	 your husband	 there,	 who	 ought	 to	 be	 ashamed	 of	 himself	 for	 skulking	 below</p>
<p class="calibre1">while	they	were	fighting	on	deck.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Monsieur	looked	foolish,	but	said	nothing	in	reply	to	this.	Madame	sniffed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	flashed	her	glittering	black	eyes,	as	if	she	could	annihilate	him	at	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">glance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	brave	Hercules!”	she	cried	indignantly,	“be	easy.	You	have	been	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	Bois	and	have	established	your	reputation	as	a	hero	and	have	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">need	to	notice	the	insulting	remarks	of	this	Englishman.	But	for	you,”	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">added,	turning	angrily	to	the	colonel,	“this	would	not	have	happened.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I?	Good	Heavens!”	exclaimed	Colonel	Vereker,	greatly	astonished	at	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">turning	 on	 him	 thus.	 “Why,	 it	 was	 I	 who	 did	 all	 in	 my	 power	 to	 prevent</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p196"></a>Captain	Alphonse	from	allowing	those	cursed	blacks	on	board	the	ship	in the	first	instance,	but	you	and	Monsieur	Boisson,	both	of	you,	persuaded</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	to	the	contrary.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	 God!	 dear	 Hercules,	 see	 how	 we	 are	 calumniated,”	 said	 the	 irate</p>
<p class="calibre1">Frenchwoman,	 rather	 illogically,	 turning	 to	 her	 miserable	 atom	 of	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">husband,	who	gesticulated	and	shrugged	his	shoulders	in	response,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking	 over	 the	 skipper	 and	 Colonel	 Vereker	 as	 if	 neither	 existed,	 she went	 on	 to	 remark	 to	 Elsie,	 who,	 however,	 did	 not	 appear	 to	 relish	 very much	 her	 conversation	 or	 endearments,	 that,	 “some	 persons	 whom	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 not	 condescend	 to	 name,	 were,	 of	 monsters,	 the	 most	 infamous</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 ungrateful—men,	 indeed,	 of	 the	 gutter—but	 that	 she,	 the	 little	 one, was	an	angel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here	the	skipper	put	an	end	to	the	interview.	He	had	evidently	seen	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 enough	 of	 the	 Boissons,	 husband	 and	 wife,	 and,	 ascending	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">companion-ladder	 at	 the	 same	 time	 as	 Garry	 and	 myself,	 I	 heard	 him</p>
<p class="calibre1">muttering	 to	 himself	 as	 he	 went	 along	 and	 just	 caught	 the	 following</p>
<p class="calibre1">words:	 “To	 think—brave	 men—lose—valuable—save	 such—theirs—too</p>
<p class="calibre1">dreadful.	She	frivolous—he—a—damned	coward!”	laying	a	rather	strong</p>
<p class="calibre1">emphasis	on	the	last	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	afterwards	went	down	again,	Garry	and	I,	and	managed	between	us</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 bring	 up	 little	 Mr	 Johnson,	 the	 brave	 fellow	 having	 picked	 up</p>
<p class="calibre1">wonderfully	after	the	attention	we	had	given	him,	and	the	knife-thrust	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	received	from	the	negro	was	found	to	have	only	grazed	his	ribs,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 was	 anxious	 for	 fresh	 air,	 after	 his	 long	 imprisonment	 below,	 and	 to see	 and	 judge	 for	 himself	 how	 things	 were	 looking	 on	 deck	 after	 our</p>
<p class="calibre1">scrimmage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here	the	light	was	waning	and	there	was	a	good	deal	to	be	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think,	Fosset,”	said	the	skipper	to	our	worthy	first	mate,	who	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">ordering	 matters	 forward	 while	 the	 former	 had	 come	 aft,	 “we	 had	 better muster	the	hands	first	so	as	to	know	who’s	missing.	I’m	afraid	several	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	poor	fellows	have	lost	the	number	of	their	mess	in	the	fight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aye,	sir,	they	have,”	replied	Mr	Fosset.	“Poor	Stoddart’s	gone,	for	one!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Poor	 fellow,	 I	 am	 sorry,”	 exclaimed	 the	 captain	 with	 much	 feeling.	 “We</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p197"></a>couldn’t	 have	 lost	 a	 better	 man,	 for	 he	 was	 about	 the	 best	 we	 had	 on board,	 poor	 fellow—a	 good	 engineer,	 a	 good	 mess-mate,	 and	 good	 at</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything	 he	 handled,	 besides	 being	 the	 finest	 fellow	 that	 ever	 wore</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoe	leather.	How	did	it	happen?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	was	knifed	by	one	of	those	black	devils,	sir,	as	he	led	the	boarders</p>
<p class="calibre1">forrad!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Poor	 Stoddart!	 I	 am	 sorry	 to	 lose	 you!	 Well,	 there’s	 no	 use	 crying	 over spilt	 milk,	 and	 all	 my	 words	 will	 never	 bring	 him	 back	 again.	 Mr	 O’Neil, just	muster	the	men	in	the	waist	and	let	us	know	the	worst	at	once!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith,	ye’re	roight,	sor;	we’d	betther	count	noses	an’	have	the	job	over,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">returned	Garry,  <i class="calibre4">sotto	voce</i>,	singing	out	in	a	louder	key	to	the	survivors	of the	 fray,	 who	 were	 grouped	 in	 the	 waist	 about	 the	 mainmast,	 where	 the remaining	Haytians	who	had	not	been	killed	outright	were	tied	up	feet	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 wrists,	 as	 the	 skipper	 had	 told	 Colonel	 Vereker	 when	 he	 came	 up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	 all	 you	  <i class="calibre4">Star	 of	 the	 Norths</i>	 that	 are	 still	 alive	 come	 over	 here	 to starboard;	the	chaps	that	are	d’id,	sure,	can	shtop	where	they	are!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 hands	 laughed	 at	 this	 Hibernian	 way	 of	 putting	 the	 matter	 to	 them, and	 answered	 their	 names	 readily	 on	 Garry	 proceeding	 to	 read	 out	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">muster	roll	from	a	paper	he	had	drawn	out	of	his	pocket—all,	that	is,	save</p>
<p class="calibre1">those	 that	 had	 fallen,	 eight	 in	 number,	 including	 poor	 Stoddart,	 our</p>
<p class="calibre1">energetic	second	engineer,	and	one	of	his	firemen	who	had	volunteered</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	swell	the	boarding	party,	as	well	as	six	of	our	best	sailors	amongst	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">foremast	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	the	rest	of	the	crew	four	were	badly	hurt	and	a	few	slightly	wounded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Spokeshave	was	one	of	these	latter,	having,	unfortunately,	the	end	of	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">nose—that	 prominent	 feature	 of	 his—cut	 clean	 off	 by	 a	 slash	 from	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">cutlass;	 but	 the	 majority,	 we	 were	 glad	 to	 find,	 mostly	 escaped</p>
<p class="calibre1">unscathed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing	 old	 Masters	 all	 right,	 I	 thought	 of	 his	 morbid	 forebodings	 before we	came	up	with	the	ship,	and	determined	to	take	a	rise	out	of	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	awfully	sorry	about	the	old	bo’sun,”	I	said	with	a	wink	to	Garry,	right</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind	 his	 back.	 “He	 wasn’t	 a	 bad	 seaman,	 but	 an	 awful	 old	 grumbler, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	so	superstitious	that	he	funked	his	own	shadow	and	daren’t	walk	up</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p198"></a>a	 hatchway	 in	 the	 dark.	 Poor	 old	 chap,	 though,	 it’s	 a	 pity	 he’s	 dead;	 I shall	miss	him	if	only	from	not	hearing	his	continued	growling	over	things</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 <i class="calibre4">might</i>	happen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well	 I’m	 blessed!”	 cried	 old	 Masters,	 completely	 flabbergasted	 at	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1">exordium	 of	 mine;	 “I	 never	 thought,	 Mister	 Haldane,	 to	 hear	 you	 speak</p>
<p class="calibre1">ag’in	me	like	that.	I	allays	believed	you	was	a	friend,	that	I	did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pretended	not	to	see	him,	and	so	too	did	Garry	O’Neil,	“tumbling	to	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">game,”	as	the	saying	goes,	while	I	went	on	with	my	chaff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	did	he	die?”	I	asked.	“Was	he	killed	at	the	first	rush?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith,	 I	 can’t	 say	 corrictly,”	 replied	 Garry	 in	 a	 very	 melancholy	 tone	 of voice.	“I’m	afeard	care	carried	him	off,	somehow	or	other,	as	it	killed	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cat,	for	he	war	the	most	disconsolate,	doleful,	down-hearted	chap	I	ivver</p>
<p class="calibre1">saw	 piping	 the	 hands	 to	 dinner.	 An’	 so	 he’s	 d’id!	 Poor	 old	 bo’sun!	 we’ll nivver	see	his	loike	ag’in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lord	 bless	 you!”	 cried	 old	 Masters	 angrily,	 stepping	 up	 nearer	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">confronting	 us,	 “I’m	 not	 dead	 at	 all,	 I	 tell	 you—I	 tell	 you	 I’m	 not—I’m blessed	if	I	am.	Can’t	you	see	me	here	alive	and	hearty	afore	you?	Look</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	it’s	his	ghost!”	I	said,	with	an	affected	and	tremulous	start.	“He	told</p>
<p class="calibre1">me,	poor	fellow,	he	felt	himself	doomed,	and	nothing	could	save	him;	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 suppose	 his	 spirit	 wants	 to	 prove	 to	 me	 he	 wasn’t	 a	 liar,	 as	 I	 always thought	he	was,	the	old	sinner!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	too	much	for	Garry,	and	he	couldn’t	hold	in	any	longer,	and	both</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 us	 roared	 at	 Masters,	 who	 looked	 scared;	 and,	 though	 angry	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">highly	incensed	with	us	at	first,	was	only	too	glad	at	its	being	but	a	joke, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	not	a	fact	that	he	was	dead,	to	bear	us	any	ill-feeling	long. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	were	horrified	when	we	were	told	later	on,	while	we	were	committing</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 deep	 the	 corpses	 of	 those	 slain—negroes	 and	 white	 men</p>
<p class="calibre1">impartially	 sharing	 the	 same	 grave	 beneath	 the	 placid	 sea,	 at	 rest	 like themselves,	the	breeze	having	died	away	again	soon	after	sunset—that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Etienne	Brago	and	François	Terne,	the	two	wounded	sailors	we	had	left</p>
<p class="calibre1">below	with	the	Boissons,	and	little	Mr	Johnson	and	the	colonel	and	Elsie</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p199"></a>of	 course,	 that	  <i class="calibre4">these</i>	 were	 the	 only	 ones	 left	 of	 the	 thirty	 odd	 souls	 on board	the	 <i class="calibre4">Saint	Pierre</i>	when	she	sailed	from	La	Guayra	a	fortnight	before! </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 all	 the	 bodies	 had	 been	 buried	 in	 their	 watery	 tomb,	 not	 forgetting that	 of	 poor	 Ivan,	 who	 we	 all	 thought	 merited	 an	 honoured	 place	 by	 the side	of	his	biped	brethren	of	valour—well,	after	all	this	had	been	done	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">skipper	had	the	pumps	rigged	and	the	decks	sluiced	down	to	wash	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	traces	of	the	fray. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	council	of	war	was	then	held	between	us	all	on	the	poop,	the	skipper	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">course	presiding,	and	the	colonel	coming	up	from	the	cabin	to	take	part	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 proceedings,	 as	 well	 as	 old	 Mr	 Stokes	 from	 our	 ship,	 where	 he	 had remained	 attending	 singlehanded	 to	 the	 duties	 of	 the	 engine-room, </p>
<p class="calibre1">denying	himself,	as	Garry	O’Neil	remarked,	“all	the	foin	of	the	foighting!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	conclave	had	been	called	for	the	purpose	of	deciding	what	was	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">done	with	the	 <i class="calibre4">Saint	Pierre</i>	and	the	captured	black	pirates	from	whom	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 salvaged	 her,	 and	 without	 much	 deliberation	 it	 was	 pretty	 soon</p>
<p class="calibre1">decided,	 on	 the	 colonel’s	 suggestion,	 to	 send	 the	 ship	 to	 her	 destined port,	 Liverpool,	 taking	 the	 negroes	 in	 her,	 so	 that	 they	 could	 be	 tried before	a	proper	court	in	England	for	the	offence	they	had	committed.	“It’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 no	 use	 your	 fetching	 them	 up	 to	 New	 York,”	 said	 the	 colonel,	 “for though	 I’m	 an	 American	 myself	 and	 am	 proud	 of	 my	 nationality,	 I	 must</p>
<p class="calibre1">confess	those	Yanks	of	the	north	mix	up	dollars	and	justice	in	a	way	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">puzzles	folk	that	are	not	accustomed	to	their	way	of	holding	the	scales.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	skipper	was	of	the	same	opinion	as	Colonel	Vereker;	so,	the	matter</p>
<p class="calibre1">having	 been	 settled,	 a	 navigating	 party	 was	 selected	 to	 work	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Saint</i> <i class="calibre4">Pierre</i>	across	the	Atlantic,	with	Garry	O’Neil	as	chief	officer.	The	skipper was	 unable	 to	 spare	 Mr	 Fosset,	 and	 Garry	 was	 all	 the	 more	 fit	 in	 every way	for	the	part,	as	he	would	be	able	to	look	after	the	wounded	French</p>
<p class="calibre1">sailors,	 who	 would	 naturally	 go	 in	 the	 ship	 as	 they	 were	 the	 principal witnesses	 against	 the	 blacks	 on	 the	 charges	 that	 would	 be	 brought</p>
<p class="calibre1">against	them	of	“piracy	on	the	high	seas.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	dark	when	all	these	details	were	finally	arranged,	and	all	of	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">went	back	aboard	on	our	vessel	for	rest	and	refreshment,	the	colonel	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	daughter,	of	course,	accompanying	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p200"></a>Madame	 and	 Monsieur	 Boisson,	 however,	 could	 not	 be	 made	 to	 leave the	ship,	saying	they	would	not	do	so—Madame,	that	is,	said	it,	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">brave	 Hercule</i>,	 following	 her	 lead	 as	 usual,	 “would	 not	 leave,”	 said	 she repeatedly,	 “until	 they	 once	 more	 touched	  <i class="calibre4">terra	 firma</i>,”	 and	 not	 wishing they	should	be	starved	for	their	obstinacy,	the	skipper	ordered	Weston	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">look	after	the	happy	pair	and	provide	them	with	food	at	the	same	time	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	did	the	wounded	and	prisoners. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 two	 vessels	 remained	 for	 the	 night,	 still	 lashed	 alongside	 for	 better security,	 all	 hands	 being	 too	 tired	 out	 besides	 to	 be	 able	 to	 do	 anything further	 beyond	 “turning	 in”	 and	 getting	 as	 much	 rest	 and	 sleep	 as	 they could	after	the	fatigue	and	excitement	of	the	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next	morning	at	sunrise	Garry	O’Neil	went	back	to	his	ship	with	his	crew</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 eight	 men—all	 the	 skipper	 was	 able	 to	 spare	 him—and	 by	 breakfast</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	they	had	made	her	all	atauto,	bending	new	sails,	which	they	found</p>
<p class="calibre1">below	in	the	forepeak,	in	place	of	the	tattered	rags	that	hung	from	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	yards,	and	otherwise	making	good	defects,	preparing	the	vessel	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	passage	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	were	all	sorry	to	part	with	Garry	even	for	the	short	period	that	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">elapse	before	he	would	rejoin	the	old	barquey,	for	he	was	the	life	of	all	us</p>
<p class="calibre1">aboard;	but	the	same	regret	was	not	felt	for	Master	Spokeshave	when	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">saw	him	go	over	the	side	to	accompany	the	Irishman,	the	skipper	having</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	 decreed,	 as	 his	 assistant	 navigator,	 the	 damage	 to	 his	 nose	 not</p>
<p class="calibre1">necessarily	 affecting	 his	 “taking	 the	 sun,”	 though	 it	 might	 interfere	 with the	little	beggar’s	altitudes	of	another	character. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	 eight	 bells	 all	 the	 details	 necessary	 under	 the	 circumstances	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">satisfactorily	 arranged,	 including	 the	 transfer	 of	 the	 effects	 belonging	 to the	colonel	and	Miss	Elsie,	these	two	preferring	to	voyage	with	us,	unlike</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 whilom	 passengers,	 the	 Boissons,	 who	 remained	 in	 their	 old</p>
<p class="calibre1">quarters,	going	with	“Captain	Garry,”	as	we	all	dubbed	our	mess-mate	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 promotion	 to	 a	 separate	 command;	 and	 half	 an	 hour	 or	 so	 later	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">splendid	 breeze	 just	 then	 springing	 up	 from	 the	 westwards	 and	 flecking</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	still	blue	water	with	buoyant	life,	the	two	ships	parted	company	amid</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 round	 of	 enthusiastic	 cheers	 that	 only	 grew	 faint	 as	 the	 distance</p>
<p class="calibre1">widened	them	apart,	the	 <i class="calibre4">Saint	Pierre</i>	sailing	off	right	before	the	wind,	with everything	set	below,	and	aloft,	across	the	ocean	on	her	course	for	Saint</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p201"></a>George’s	 Channel,	 while	 we	 braced	 our	 yards	 sharp	 up	 and	 bore	 away full	 speed	 ahead	 in	 the	 opposite	 direction,	 bound	 for	 New	 York,	 which</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">I	go	to	Venezuela. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’d	better	stick	to	us,”	said	the	skipper	to	Colonel	Vereker,	who	talked</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	taking	the	next	Cunard	steamer,	which	was	advertised	to	leave	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">morrow,	 as	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Star	 of	 the	 North</i>	 was	 being	 berthed	 in	 our	 company’s dock	 on	 the	 East	 River.	 “I’m	 only	 going	 to	 stop	 here	 long	 enough	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">discharge	our	cargo	and	ship	a	fresh	one;	which	is	all	ready	and	waiting</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	us;	and	then,	sir,	we’ll	‘make	tracks,’	as	our	friends	the	Yankees	say, </p>
<p class="calibre1">right	away	over	the	‘herring-pond’	to	Liverpool	as	fast	as	steam	and	sail</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	carry	the	old	barquey.	Better	stick	to	us,	colonel,	and	see	the	voyage</p>
<p class="calibre1">out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	Señor	Applegarth,”	replied	the	colonel,	who	could	not	drop	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spanish	phraseology	all	at	once,	though	otherwise	gradually	returning	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	and	our	own	native	tongue	and	becoming	less	of	a	foreigner	in	every</p>
<p class="calibre1">way,	“I	will	return	with	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both	were	as	good	as	their	word,	he	and	little	Elsie	coming	home	with	us, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	the	skipper	making	the	passage	from	Sandy	Hook	to	the	Mersey	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">eight	 days	 from	 land	 to	 land,	 the	 fastest	 run	 we	 had	 ever	 yet	 achieved across	the	Atlantic,	whether	outward	or	homeward-bound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But,	 quick	 as	 we	 were,	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Saint	 Pierre</i>	 managed	 to	 reach	 Liverpool before	 we	 did,	 the	 pilot	 who	 boarded	 us	 off	 the	 Skerries	 bringing	 the news	that	she	had	gone	up	the	river	a	tide	ahead	of	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	piece	of	intelligence	was	confirmed	beyond	question	by	Garry	O’Neil</p>
<p class="calibre1">coming	 off	 in	 the	 company’s	 tug	 that	 sheered	 alongside	 as	 we	 dropped</p>
<p class="calibre1">anchor	in	the	stream	later	on,	midway	between	the	Prince’s	landing-stage</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 the	 Birkenhead	 shore,	 the	 manager	 of	 our	 line	 being	 anxious	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">compliment	the	skipper	on	his	successful	rescue	of	the	French	ship,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">percentage	on	whose	valuable	cargo	for	bringing	her	safely	to	port,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">thus	 saving	 all	 loss	 to	 the	 underwriters,	 would	 more	 than	 repay	 any</p>
<p class="calibre1">damage	 done	 for	 the	 detention	 of	 our	 vessel	 when	 engaged	 on	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">errand	of	mercy	and	justice	that	took	her	off	her	course. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p203"></a>In	 addition	 likewise	 to	 the	 thanks	 of	 the	 company	 and	 the	 underwriters, the	 skipper	 was	 also	 presented	 with	 a	 handsome	 gold	 chronometer</p>
<p class="calibre1">watch	 by	 the	 committee	 of	 Lloyds,	 besides	 participating	 in	 the	 amount</p>
<p class="calibre1">awarded	by	the	charterers	of	the	 <i class="calibre4">Saint	Pierre</i>	for	the	salvage	of	the	ship, though	in	this	latter	apportionment	it	was	only	fair	to	mention	that	we	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">shared,	 officers	 and	 crew	 alike,	 I	 for	 my	 part	 coming	 into	 the	 sudden possession	 of	 such	 a	 tidy	 little	 sum	 of	 ready	 money	 that	 I	 felt	 myself	 a comparative	millionaire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 talking	 with	 Garry,	 whom	 it	 is	 almost	 needless	 to	 say	 all	 hands</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 glad	 to	 see	 again,	 the	 men	 cheering	 him	 lustily	 as	 he	 crossed	 the gangway	 from	 the	 tug,	 he	 told	 us	 that	 though	 otherwise	 they	 had	 had	 a fairly	 pleasant	 voyage	 after	 parting	 company	 with	 us	 off	 the	 Azores,	 the Boissons	gave	him	a	good	deal	of	trouble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Madame,	 he	 said,	 worried	 his	 life	 out	 by	 “making	 eyes”	 at	 him	 when	 he went	below	at	meal-times,	while	on	deck	he	was	never	safe	for	a	moment</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	her	embarrassing	attentions	unless,	in	desperation,	as	he	was	often</p>
<p class="calibre1">forced	to	do,	he	went	aloft	to	get	out	of	her	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith,	an’	sure,	that	warn’t	the	worst	of	it	nayther,”	complained	Garry	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 humorous	 way.	 “Though	 the	 vain,	 silly	 ould	 crayture	 bate	 Banagher</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	flirtin’—an’,	indade,	bates	ivviry	other	of	her	sex,	God	bless	’em,	that</p>

<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Ah,	non,	non,	mon	Dieu,	non</i>,	note	yat	vay!”	sez	he,	joompin’	away	from</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Why,”	inquired	the	skipper,	when	we	had	both	a	good	laugh	at	Garry	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 account	 of	 the	 Boisson	 episode,	 “have	 they	 left,	 then,	 the	 ship	 for good?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith,	 yis,	 sor,	 bag	 an’	 baggage,	 the	 blissid	 pair	 of	 ’em,	 an’	 moighty pleased	I	wor	to	say	the	backs	of	’em!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 how	 about	 the	 trial	 of	 those	 black	 devils,	 those	 pirates,	 then;	 won’t they	be	required	as	witnesses	against	the	murderers?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	sor,”	replied	Garry.	“The	polis	officers	that	came	aboard	whin	we	got</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Oh!”	 said	 the	 skipper,	 “have	 these	 men	 been	 brought	 up	 before	 the</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p205"></a>All	 happened	 as	 Garry	 O’Neil	 informed	 us,	 the	 Haytians	 and	 mutineer blacks	 of	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Saint	 Pierre’s</i>	 crew	 being	 brought	 up	 again	 before	 the magistrates	the	week	following	our	arrival	home,	when,	after	hearing	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">additional	 evidence	 against	 them	 given	 by	 Colonel	 Vereker	 and	 the</p>

<p class="calibre1">month,	on	the	charge	of	“piracy	and	murder	on	the	high	seas.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	colonel	took	advantage	of	the	interval	that	would	necessarily	have	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">elapse	 before	 his	 presence	 would	 again	 be	 required	 in	 court	 to	 escort</p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	 Elsie	 to	 Paris,	 and	 place	 her	 under	 the	 care	 of	 the	 sisters	 at	 the convent	 at	 Neuilly,	 where,	 I	 think	 I	 told	 you	 before,	 he	 said	 her	 mother had	 been	 brought	 up	 and	 educated;	 while	 the	 skipper	 and	 others	 of	 us</p>
<p class="calibre1">belonging	 to	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Star	 of	 the	 North</i>,	 being	 compelled	 to	 remain	 within handy	reach	of	the	authorities,	in	case	our	presence	at	the	trial	might	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">required,	the	opportunity	was	seized	to	lay	the	old	barquey	up	in	dry	dock</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	give	her	a	thorough	overhaul	within	and	without,	though	the	engines, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 proved	 by	 our	 rapid	 passage	 here,	 were	 none	 the	 worse	 for	 our</p>

<p class="calibre1">Stoddart	and	the	rest	of	old	Mr	Stokes’	staff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	 of	 us	 in	 this	 way	 got	 a	 short	 holiday	 while	 awaiting	 the	 assizes, which	I	spent	with	my	mother	and	sister,	taking	home	with	me	the	money</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	been	awarded	as	my	share	of	the	 <i class="calibre4">Saint	Pierre’s</i>	salvage,	which	had</p>

<p class="calibre1">Alas,	 though,	 the	 sum,	 large	 though	 it	 was	 for	 a	 young	 fellow	 to	 find unexpectedly	 in	 his	 pocket,	 went	 but	 a	 very	 short	 step	 in	 satisfying	 the rapacious	 wolf	 I	 found	 at	 my	 mother’s	 door	 when	 I	 reached	 the	 little</p>

<p class="calibre1">A	 bubble	 company,	 whose	 directors	 had	 all	 been	 selected	 for	 their</p>

<p class="calibre1">The	 devout	 rogue	 who	 had	 “managed”	 the	 concern	 to	 his	 own	 worldly</p>

<p class="calibre1">to	render	him,	Colonel	Vereker	was	kind	enough	to	notice	me	much	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	 my	 subordinate	 position	 on	 board	 would	 have	 seemed	 to	 warrant; </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	in	a	conversation	we	had	together	during	the	voyage	home	from	New</p>
<p class="calibre1">York,	after	asking	me	what	my	prospects	were,	he	made	me	an	offer	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">accompany	him	back	to	Venezuela	on	his	return,	promising	me,	should	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">accept,	a	good	salary	to	start	with,	and	a	fair	chance	of	ultimately	making</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	fortune. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Loving	 the	 sea	 and	 my	 profession,	 however,	 with	 all	 a	 sailor’s	 love, </p>
<p class="calibre1">besides	being	attached	to	my	old	ship	and	her	officers,	I	felt	no	inclination</p>
<p class="calibre1">then	 to	 give	 up	 what	 I	 had	 learnt	 to	 look	 upon	 as	 my	 legitimate	 calling, and	 turn	 landsman;	 so,	 although	 I	 had	 the	 highest	 admiration	 for	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">colonel,	coupled	with	more	than	a	liking	for	his	young	daughter,	between</p>
<p class="calibre1">whom	 and	 myself	 there	 seemed	 such	 a	 mysterious	 sympathy	 on	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">evening	 of	 my	 sighting	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Saint	 Pierre</i>,	 when	 the	 captain	 declared	 we were	some	hundreds	of	miles	apart,	I	reluctantly	and,	so	it	seemed	to	me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">ungraciously,	declined	his	proposal,	telling	him	I	preferred	“sticking”	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">skipper	and	the	old	barquey! </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	the	colonel	very	kindly	would	not	take	my	refusal	at	first	as	final;	and, </p>
<p class="calibre1">when	setting	out	for	Paris	to	take	Elsie	to	her	convent	school,	she	taking</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p207"></a>leave	 of	 me	 with	 many	 tears	 and	 assurances	 that	 under	 any circumstances	 she	 would	 always	 remain	  <i class="calibre4">mio	 amiquito</i>	 (my	 little	 friend) pledging	 herself,	 too,	 to	 be,	 if	 allowed	 at	 the	 school,	 a	 constant</p>
<p class="calibre1">correspondent	if	I	would	write	to	her	sometimes	to	let	her	know	where	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was.	 Well,	 the	 kind,	 good-hearted	 man,	 taking,	 as	 he	 said,	 a	 deep</p>
<p class="calibre1">interest	in	my	welfare	for	Elsie’s	sake	as	well	as	for	my	own,	assured	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	he	would	keep	his	generous	offer	open	until	the	period	arrived	for	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">ultimate	departure	for	South	America,	on	the	termination	of	the	trial	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Haytian	pirates	and	their	mutineer	accomplices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	 recollecting	 all	 this,	 in	 my	 hour	 of	 need,	 I	 naturally	 turned	 to	 the colonel	 and	 told	 him	 of	 my	 trouble	 on	 his	 return	 to	 Liverpool	 for	 the assizes,	at	which,	by	the	way,	the	black	scoundrels	and	their	allies	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">sentenced	to	five	years’	penal	servitude,	the	judge	regretting	his	inability</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 impose	 a	 heavier	 punishment	 from	 the	 fact	 of	 proof	 being	 wanted	 of the	active	participation	of	the	prisoners	in	the	atrociously	cruel	murder	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cato	and	the	other	diabolical	work	perpetrated	on	board	the	ill-fated	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 were	 all	 glad	 when	 this	 matter,	 with	 the	 examination	 and	 sickening</p>
<p class="calibre1">details	 that	 it	 entailed,	 was	 finally	 settled,	 and	 we	 were	 at	 liberty	 to	 go where	we	liked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Colonel	Vereker	more	than	justified	my	confidence	in	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Heavens!	my	boy,	you	must	and	shall	be	as	my	son,”	he	said,	wringing</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 hand	 in	 a	 grip	 that	 I	 knew	 would	 be	 faithful	 unto	 death.	 “Come	 with me	and	I	will	make	a	man	of	you,	and	a	rich	one,	too,	Dick	Haldane!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 how	 shall	 I	 manage	 about	 my	 mother	 and	 sister,	 sir?”	 said	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">hesitatingly.	“How	shall	I	manage	about	them	during	my	absence?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 can	 make	 over	 your	 salary	 to	 them,	 for	 you	 will	 not	 want	 anything while	 at	 Caracas,	 as	 you	 will	 live	 with	 me	 as	 my	 private	 secretary,”	 he replied,	with	another	hearty	shake	of	my	hand.	“The	money	shall	be	paid</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 your	 mother	 regularly	 by	 my	 agent	 here,	 so	 that	 you	 need	 have	 no</p>
<p class="calibre1">fears	 on	 that	 score	 as	 to	 her	 support.	 But	 I	 do	 not	 want	 you	 to	 decide such	 an	 important	 change	 in	 your	 life	 without	 proper	 consideration,	 and the	 advice	 of	 your	 friends,	 my	 boy.	 Go	 and	 consult	 Señor	 Applegarth, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who	 I	 know	 is	 an	 old	 friend	 of	 yours	 as	 well	 as	 being	 your	 captain;	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p208"></a>then,	if	he	and	your	other	friends	advise	your	acceptance	of	my	offer,	and your	mother	and	sister	are	willing	to	part	with	you—why	then,	Dick,	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">may	consider	the	matter	settled,	and	you,	some	day,	will	be	very	thankful</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	accepted	my	offer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	skipper	did	not	hesitate	for	one	moment	in	giving	his	opinion,	though, </p>
<p class="calibre1">like	 most	 of	 my	 mess-mates,	 he	 was	 good	 enough	 to	 say	 how	 sorry	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	be	to	part	with	me,	and	how	he	would	miss	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	by	all	means,	my	lad,”	said	he.	“By	George!	it’s	a	chance	that	doesn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">come	 twice	 in	 a	 fellow’s	 lifetime,	 and	 you	 may	 consider	 your	 fortune	 as good	as	made!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr	Fosset	and	Garry	O’Neil	were	equally	enthusiastic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith,	 now,	 sor!”	 observed	 the	 latter,	 with	 a	 comical	 air	 of	 assured</p>
<p class="calibre1">deference	 at	 my	 future	 dignified	 position,	 as	 he	 imagined	 it	 would	 be,	 “I hope	ye’ll	remember	ye’r	humble	ould	fri’nd	Garry	whim	ye’re	Prisidint	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 Venezuelan	 Raypublic,	 mid	 a	 lot	 of	 yaller	 divvles	 for	 lackeys,	 an’	 so many	dollars	that	ye	won’t	know	what	to	do	wid	’em.	Begorrah,	it’s	wishin’</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 am,	 I	 stood	 in	 ye’r	 shoes,	 alannah,	 an’	 I	 wouldn’t	 care	 for	 to	 call	 the Pope	me	ouncle,	God	bless	him!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Spokeshave,	though,	sneered	at	my	success	in	gaining	so	good	a	friend</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 the	 colonel;	 but	 owing	 to	 the	 accident	 to	 the	 top	 of	 his	 nose,	 which being	still	bandaged,	or	rather	court-plastered	up,	and	not	tending	to	add</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	his	beauty,	he	was	not	able	to	turn	it	up	and	sniff	in	his	former	irritating</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	that	always	exasperated	me	so	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	for	old	Masters,	his	face	became	the	picture	of	woe	when	I	informed</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	I	was	leaving	the	ship	and	the	company’s	service. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 mark	 my	 words,	 Master	 Haldane,”	 said	 he	 in	 his	 most	 sepulchral</p>
<p class="calibre1">manner,	“many	a	one	afore	you	has	throwed	up	the	sea,	and	what	good</p>
<p class="calibre1">has	 it	 done	 ’em?	 No	 good!	 Them	 that	 goes	 to	 sea	 oughter	 stick	 to	 the sea,	that’s	what	I	says;	and	if	they	throws	it	up,	though	I	hopes	you	won’t, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 allus	 live	 to	 repent	 it.	 I	 be	 truly	 sorry	 you	 be	 goin’,	 and	 ah,	 Master Haldane,	I	sed	as	how	summet	’ud	come	of	our	seein’	that	there	blessed</p>
<p class="calibre1">ghost-ship!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p209"></a>“And	 so	 something	  <i class="calibre4">has</i>	 happened,	 bo’sun,	 and	 a	 precious	 lot	 too,	 my hearty!”	 said	 I,	 jokingly,	 as	 I	 stood	 on	 the	 gangway	 preparatory	 to	 going over	the	side.	“But	never	mind	that	now,	old	shipmate!	Good-bye	to	you, </p>
<p class="calibre1">men,	and	thank	you	all	for	your	kindness	to	me	from	the	time	I	first	sailed</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	you	as	a	youngster.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	really	believe	I	could	see	a	tear	in	the	old	bo’sun’s	eye	as	he	wished	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">farewell	with	the	rest	of	them,	the	crew	manning	the	rigging	to	give	me	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">hearty	cheer	and	“send	off”	that	could	be	heard	across	the	Mersey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus	 it	 was	 that	 I	 took	 leave	 of	 the	 old	 barquey,	 and,	 my	 mother’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">consent	having	been	obtained	before	I	finally	settled	with	the	colonel,	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">further	 arrangements	 had	 to	 be	 perfected	 beyond	 obtaining	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">preparing	my	kit,	and	a	hasty	run	to	the	cottage	to	pay	a	last	visit	to	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">old	 mother	 and	 sister	 Janet,	 and	 wish	 them	 farewell	 for	 a	 few	 years, </p>
<p class="calibre1">when	I	looked	forward	to	returning	to	England	and	finding	them	both	well</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	happy,	and	in	more	comfortable	and	prosperous	circumstances. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 same	 afternoon	 Colonel	 Vereker	 and	 I	 started	 off	 by	 train	 from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Liverpool	 for	 Southampton,	 at	 which	 latter	 port	 we	 embarked	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">outward	 bound	 West	 India	 mail	 steamer,	 sailing	 for	 Colon,  <i class="calibre4">en	 route</i>	 to Venezuela. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Twenty	Eight. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">During	Seven	Years. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 reached	 La	 Guayra,	 and	 from	 thence	 Caracas,	 safely	 enough,	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">spite	of	the	country	just	then	passing	through	the	acute	stage	of	one	of	its</p>
<p class="calibre1">periodical	 revolutions	 that	 had	 supervened	 on	 the	 top	 of	 an	 earthquake; which	 convulsions	 of	 nature	 and	 society	 are	 characteristic	 features	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Venezuela,	 like	 as	 the	 chief	 products	 of	 its	 fertile	 soil	 are	 cocoa	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">“patriots,”	 the	 latter	 being	 almost	 as	 great	 an	 article	 of	 export	 as	 the former,	 especially	 after	 a	 political	 crisis,	 and	 consisting	 of	 all	 sorts	 and conditions	of	men	who,	whether	born	subjects	or	alien	intriguers,	are	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">desirous	 of	 serving	 their	 natural	 or	 adopted	 mother	 country	 for	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">consideration! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p210"></a>Colonel	 Vereker	 was	 largely	 interested	 in	 an	 extensive	 gold	 mine	 in	 the interior,	where	he	put	me	as	his	overseer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	not	an	unwise	measure	for	his	own	sake,	apart	from	any	motive</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	had	in	advancing	my	welfare—his	real	reason	for	appointing	me	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">post;	for,	with	the	exception	of	the	captain	of	the	mine,	a	Frenchman,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">majority	 of	 those	 employed	 were	 half-caste	 Spaniards	 and	 Portuguese, </p>
<p class="calibre1">all	 of	 whom	 studied	 their	 several	 individual	 pockets	 rather	 than	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">interest	 of	 their	 employer,	 while	 the	 main	 body	 of	 workers	 were	 péons</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	mezites,	bastard	mulattoes,	with	a	large	intermixture	of	negro	blood, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who	 valued	 their	 own	 lives	 as	 little	 as	 they	 did	 the	 lives	 of	 those	 with whom	they	had	to	deal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	plenty	of	work	to	do	here,	looking	after	all	these	scoundrels,	having</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	keep	my	eyes	open	as	much	as	possible	in	order	to	prevent	wholesale</p>
<p class="calibre1">robbery	 as	 far	 as	 I	 could,	 although	 it	 was	 utterly	 impossible	 to	 prevent petty	 pilfering	 of	 the	 ore	 on	 its	 way	 from	 the	 mine	 to	 Puerto	 Cabello,	 its general	port	for	transhipment	to	Europe,	to	swell	the	treasure	chest	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">exiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,	by	adopting	the	old	Latin	maxim,  <i class="calibre4">Suaviter	in	modo,	fortiter	in	re</i>, treating	all	without	hauteur,	which	some	of	the	insolent	half-caste	Spanish</p>
<p class="calibre1">creoles	 affected,	 and	 yet	 keeping	 my	 revolver	 ready,	 with	 “my	 powder</p>
<p class="calibre1">dry,”	 so	 as	 to	 be	 prepared	 for	 any	 emergency,	 I	 managed	 to	 get	 along very	well	with	the	mixed	lot	I	was	set	over,	winning	golden	opinions	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">every	one	but	a	few	of	the	worst	characters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 sounds	 as	 if	 I	 were	 boasting,	 but	 this	 is	 something	 for	 a	 young</p>
<p class="calibre1">Englishman	to	be	able	to	say	in	a	country	which,	though	it	is	the	veritable</p>
<p class="calibre1">El	 Dorado	 of	 poor	 Drake’s	 dreams,	 and	 has	 possibly	 a	 future	 of	 wealth and	prosperity	before	it	when	it	comes	under	the	rule	of	the	Anglo-Saxon</p>

<p class="calibre1">much	matter,	for	we	are	all	of	the	same	race	and	enterprising	spirit—can</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	better	described	in	respect	of	its	present	condition	by	a	shorter	and	far</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	expressive	word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amongst	 my	 other	 duties	 I	 had	 charge	 of	 all	 the	 colonel’s	 voluminous</p>
<p class="calibre1">correspondence,	 he	 having	 a	 mortal	 hatred	 to	 all	 letter	 writing	 in	 any shape	 or	 form,	 and	 in	 addition	 to	 my	 good	 patron’s	 business</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p211"></a>communications,	 was	 entrusted	 with	 the	 task	 of	 despatching	 a	 lengthy epistle	every	other	mail—they	went	fortnightly	from	La	Guayra	to	France</p>
<p class="calibre1">—informing	 Miss	 Elsie	 of	 our	 doings,	 the	 colonel	 himself	 adding	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">briefest	 of	 postscripts	 to	 his	  <i class="calibre4">pequiña	 niña</i>,	 as	 he	 invariably	 termed	 her and	always	enclosing	some	remembrance	for	his	little	daughter,	to	show</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 his	 love	 exceeded	 any	 epistolary	 proof	 of	 the	 same,	 as	 well	 as	 a more	substantial	token	of	a	handsome	cheque	for	her	maintenance	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">education,	forwarded	to	the	care	of	the	mother	superior	of	the	convent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	all	my	manifold	duties	this	was	the	pleasantest	I	had	to	perform,	being</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	grateful	as	water	poured	on	the	parched	soil	of	my	exile	amongst	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">alien	 people,	 antagonistic	 to	 me	 in	 everything,	 and	 with	 whom	 I	 had	 to shape	 a	 steady	 course,	 and	 preserve	 a	 “stiff	 weather	 helm,”	 as	 sailors say,	to	 avoid	 open	 rupture	 and	 assassination,	 the	 Venezuelese	 “sticking</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	nothing,”	especially	when	that	“nothing”	happened	to	be	one	whom,	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	 sufficient	 reason	 to	 their	 minds,	 they	 deemed	 an	 enemy	 and	 they</p>
<p class="calibre1">chanced	to	be	behind	his	back—and	as	I	told	you	before,	I	steered	clear</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	many	enemies,	but	I	could	never	learn	to	trust	them	as	a	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes,	my	happiest	hours	at	San	Félipe	were	spent	in	writing	to	little	Elsie, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who	answered	my	own	letters,	as	well	as	those	I	despatched	on	behalf	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 colonel,	 with	 unvarying	 punctuality,	 holding	 to	 the	 promise	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1">spontaneously	gave	in	England	when	we	parted	on	her	going	to	school, </p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 which	 time	 she	 had	 no	 idea	 of	 my	 ever	 accompanying	 her	 father	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">South	America. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Similarly,	the	saddest	task	that	could	have	been	laid	on	my	shoulders	fell</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	my	lot	five	years	later,	when	the	mysterious	attraction	by	which	I	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 drawn	 towards	 her	 as	 a	 boy	 had	 grown	 into	 the	 most	 absorbing</p>
<p class="calibre1">affection—a	love	that	filled	my	heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 I	 had	 to	 write	 and	 tell	 her—I,	 who	 would	 cheerfully	 have	 laid	 down my	life	to	save	her	a	pang—to	tell	her	of	her	dear	father’s	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	occurred	just	as	poor	Colonel	Vereker	had	arranged	for	my	returning</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	him	to	the	capital	of	the	State,	where	another	revolution—the	sixth,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe,	since	I	had	been	in	the	country—had	broken	out,	with	the	object, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	the	object	of	all	these	explosions	of	the	mob	invariably	was,	to	depose</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 reigning	 party	 in	 power,	 and	 put	 the	 leaders	 of	 “the	 popular</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p212"></a>movement”	for	the	time	being,	in	the	power	of	the	deposed	authorities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 colonel,	 who	 had	 a	 good	 deal	 staked	 on	 the	 issue	 of	 the	 struggle, took	 up	 arms	 on	 the	 side	 of	 the	 cause	 he	 esteemed	 just—that	 to	 which the	 most	 respectable	 of	 the	 inhabitants	 to	 a	 man	 adhered—as	 he	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">taken	 up	 arms	 before	 for	 the	 party	 of	 law	 and	 order,	 amongst	 whom	 he was	looked	up	to,	not	only	as	a	skilled	soldier	and	tactician,	but	a	stalwart</p>
<p class="calibre1">partisan,	his	very	name	being	a	tower	of	strength. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alas!	though,	no	opportunity	was	afforded	him	now	to	display	his	valour</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	battlefield	and	lead	his	hosts	to	victory;	for	while	we	were	 <i class="calibre4">en	route</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">for	Caracas,	a	dastardly	hound	of	a	creole,	whose	blood	was	a	mixture	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 beast	 elements—part	 Spaniard,	 part	 Portuguese,	 part	 negro—well, </p>
<p class="calibre1">this	 treacherous	 brute	 assassinated	 Colonel	 Vereker	 in	 the	 most</p>
<p class="calibre1">cowardly	fashion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	by	and	saw	it	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 vile	 murderer	 came	 up	 to	 my	 poor	 friend	 as	 we	 were	 resting	 in	 a <i class="calibre4">posada</i>	 on	 the	 road	 from	 San	 Félipe;	 and,	 while	 engaging	 him	 in	 an apparently	 friendly	 conversation	 respecting	 the	 political	 points	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rising,	 he	 suddenly	 stabbed	 the	 dear	 old	 man	 in	 the	 back	 with	 a	 long stiletto	which	he	had	hidden	up	his	wide	shirt	sleeves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fortunately,	I	was	there,	and	I	had	time	to	send	a	bullet	through	his	brain</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 my	 revolver	 before	 the	 wretch	 could	 stir	 a	 yard	 from	 the	 spot;	 but this	 could	 not	 save	 my	 noble-hearted,	 kind,	 generous	 protector,	 a	 man</p>
<p class="calibre1">who	had	been	more	than	a	father	to	me,	and	for	whom	I	had	the	utmost</p>
<p class="calibre1">affection	and	respect.	No;	the	death	of	the	scoundrel	could	not	save	him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">for	the	wound	the	cowardly	scoundrel	had	inflicted	was	mortal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	dear	friend	and	companion	only	survived	long	enough	to	confide	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">daughter	 to	 my	 care	 and	 give	 me	 his	 blessing	 ere	 he	 died,	 drawing	 his last	breath	in	my	arms,	a	smile	on	his	face	and	dauntless	to	the	end,	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	pressed	my	hand	and	uttered	the	usual	parting	phrase	he	had	learnt</p>

<p class="calibre1">morrow!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	a	long	to-morrow,	indeed! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p213"></a>After	seeing	the	last	tribute	of	respect	paid	to	the	colonel’s	remains,	the gallant	fellow	being	buried	close	to	the	 <i class="calibre4">posada</i>	where	he	had	met	with	his untimely	end,	and	a	cross	which	I	carved	myself	placed	above	his	lonely</p>

<p class="calibre1">living,	 a	 monument	 of	 nature’s	 handiwork,	 I	 resumed	 my	 journey	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Caracas,	in	order	to	carry	out	my	lost	friend’s	last	directions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	  <i class="calibre4">alcalde</i>,	 who	 acted	 as	 the	 colonel’s	 agent	 and	 was	 largely	 in	 his confidence,	being	an	acquaintance	of	many	years’	standing,	produced	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">copy	 of	 Colonel	 Vereker’s	 will	 for	 my	 inspection,	 assuring	 me	 that	 this had	been	drawn	up	during	his	last	visit	to	the	State	capital,	while	all	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">affairs	 were	 in	 the	 most	 perfect	 order,	 “the	 poor	 gentleman,”	 as	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">alcalde</i>	 expressed	 it,	 “being	 under	 the	 opinion	 that	 he	 would	 not	 have long	to	live,”	a	presentiment	of	death	I	have	often	found	many	people	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Generous	and	thoughtful	for	others	to	the	end,	he	had	not	forgotten	me	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	his	last	testament,	showing	that	the	regard	he	had	already	displayed</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	my	welfare	was	no	mere	temporary	fancy! </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 the	 contrary,	 much	 to	 my	 astonishment,	 he	 had	 bequeathed	 to	 me</p>
<p class="calibre1">quite	half	his	fortune—all	his	share,	indeed,	in	the	Gondifera	mine—while</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	 his	 realised	 property,	 which	 was	 invested	 in	 good	 English	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">American	 securities,	 out	 of	 the	 reach	 of	 the	 grasping	 hand	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hungerful	Venezuelan	patriots—all	this	he	left	to	his	daughter	Elsie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	 a	 codicil,	 too,	 appended	 to	 the	 document,	 more	 in	 the	 form	 of	 a sacred	 charge	 than	 a	 legal	 instrument,	 “reading	 between	 the	 lines,”	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 perceive	 that	 the	 large-hearted	 man	 had	 fathomed	 the	 secret</p>
<p class="calibre1">desire	of	my	heart,	though	secret	it	evidently	was	not	to	him,	loving	Elsie</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 he	 did,	 albeit	 in	 a	 different	 fashion;	 for	 after	 enjoining	 upon	 me	 to regard	 his	 little	 daughter’s	 interests	 even	 as	 he	 had	 studied	 mine,	 he added	 that	 should	 fate	 bring	 us	 together	 in	 the	 future	 as	 had	 happened so	 strangely	 in	 the	 past,	 his	 dearest	 wish	 would	 be	 gratified,	 for	 he	 had already	learnt	to	care	for	me	and	to	look	upon	me	as	his	son! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	course	nothing	of	this	was	mentioned	when	writing	to	tell	Elsie	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">awful	event	and	dreadful	calamity	that	had	befallen	her,	although	later	on, </p>
<p class="calibre1">before	 I	 was	 able	 to	 return	 to	 England,	 when	 her	 education	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p214"></a>completed	 and	 the	 good	 nuns	 wrote	 to	 me,	 as	 her	 father’s	 executor,	 to say	the	time	had	arrived	for	taking	her	away	from	the	convent	unless	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">wished	 to	 change	 her	 religion	 and	 join	 the	 sisterhood,	 to	 both	 of	 which courses	I	was,	of	course,	bitterly	opposed,	and,	as	you	may	imagine,	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">delighted	when	Elsie	herself	requested	to	be	allowed	to	leave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	must,	however,	have	accidentally	have	shown	my	feelings	towards	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 have	 “let	 the	 cat	 out	 of	 the	 bag”	 in	 the	 letter	 I	 sent	 home	 to	 my mother,	 in	 answer	 to	 the	 last	 communication	 from	 Neuilly,	 asking	 her	 to take	charge	of	my	darling	Elsie	until	I	came	home	to	win	and	claim	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	imagined	this	from	something	that	leaked	out	afterwards,	and	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhat	 altered	 tone	 of	 Elsie’s	 letters	 to	 me	 from	 the	 date	 of	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaving	 France	 to	 live	 with	 my	 mother;	 for,	 though	 affectionate	 enough, they	 had	 a	 certain	 little	 air	 of	 constraint	 about	 them,	 and	 though	 she spoke	of	various	objects	of	interest	to	both	of	us,	and	of	different	persons</p>
<p class="calibre1">whom	she	and	I	knew,	and	places	she	went	to,	she	never	by	any	chance</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever	mentioned	herself,	never	after	the	letters	she	sent	me	containing	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">passionate	 outpouring	 of	 her	 inmost	 heart	 on	 receiving	 the	 news	 of	 her father’s	death,	albeit	all	this	she	would	feel	perfectly	certain	was	to	me	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sacred	confidence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slight	as	the	change	was	in	her	subsequent	correspondence,	I	noticed	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	it	worried	me,	and	determined	me	to	have	the	matter	cleared	up	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">soon	as	I	possibly	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile,	however,	I	had	to	fulfil	the	colonel’s	last	trust,	and	as	I	knew</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	his	intentions	had	been	in	regard	to	the	crisis	in	Venezuelan	affairs</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	the	time	when	an	assassin’s	hand	prevented	him	from	acting	the	part</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 intended	 to	 play	 in	 the	 existing	 revolution,	 I	 thought	 I	 should	 be	 only carrying	out	his	wishes	in	putting	myself	in	his	place,	as	far	as	it	lay	in	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">power	to	do	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	soon	after	coming	to	Caracas	and	settling	the	details	of	the	colonel’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">last	 depositions,	 making	 my	 own	 will	 in	 my	 turn	 in	 case	 of	 accidents, though	in	what	way	is	best	known	to	myself,	I	went	to	the	headquarters	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Government	troops	and	joined	the	army	of	General	Gomez. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under	 this	 able	 leader	 I	 fought	 in	 several	 engagements	 that	 were	 fierce</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p215"></a>and	sanguinary	as	all	such	fratricidal	contests	are	and	ever	have	been	in the	 annals	 of	 civil	 war,	 at	 San	 Sebastien,	 Carapana,	 Tarasca,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">elsewhere,	 our	 guerilla	 struggle	 extending	 over	 the	 whole	 extensive</p>
<p class="calibre1">country	 in	 almost	 every	 direction,	 where	 there	 was	 a	 town	 to	 sack	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1">property	 to	 plunder,	 until	 at	 last	 the	 insurgent	 “patriots”	 were	 conquered and	peace	restored. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 this	 took	 a	 long	 time;	 and	 then,	 having	 had	 enough	 and	 to	 spare	 of fighting	and	bloodshed,	and	tired	of	mining	too,	I	disposed	of	my	interest</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	Gondifera	mine,	and	at	last	sailed	for	Europe,	bidding	a	long	adieu</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 Venezuela	 and	 everything	 belonging	 to	 it,	 my	 journey	 home	 being</p>
<p class="calibre1">hastened	by	a	somewhat	tenderer	letter	than	usual	from	Elsie,	who	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">read	 a	 paragraph	 in	 the	 papers	 about	 my	 having	 been	 wounded	 at	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">battle	of	San	Sebastien,	though,	of	course,	I	had	not	mentioned	anything</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	the	affair	to	her	or	my	mother,	as	it	was	a	mere	flea	bite	and	of	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">consequence,	 and	 I	 feared	 to	 have	 alarmed	 them	 needlessly	 had	 I	 said</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything	about	it	in	my	letters	to	them	at	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Twenty	Nine. </b></p>

<p class="calibre1">I	 had	 scarcely	 stepped	 into	 the	 train	 from	 Southampton,	 bound</p>
<p class="calibre1">Londonwards,  <i class="calibre4">en	 route</i>	 for	 Liverpool,	 having	 only	 landed	 from	 the	 mail steamer	that	brought	me	direct	all	the	way	from	Colon	that	very	morning, </p>
<p class="calibre1">when	 whom	 should	 I	 see	 looking	 at	 me	 from	 the	 opposite	 corner	 of	 the railway	carriage	but	a	big,	bushy-haired,	brown-bearded	man	whom	I	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	know	from	Adam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith,”	exclaimed	this	gentleman,	after	a	moment’s	scrutiny,	a	broad	grin</p>
<p class="calibre1">lighting	up	his	face	and	his	eyes	twinkling	with	a	comical	expression	that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p216"></a>would	alone	have	made	me	recognise	him,	had	I	not	heard	his	delightful, to	me	at	any	rate,	Irish	brogue,	“ye’re	ayther	Dick	Haldane	or	the	divvle!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">stretching	out	both	hands	to	grasp	mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 was	 as	 pleased	 to	 see	 him,	 as	 may	 readily	 be	 believed,	 as	 the	 genial Irishman	was	to	see	me,	I	was	sure,	even	without	his	telling	me	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,”	 said	 I,	 after	 we	 had	 pretty	 nigh	 wrung	 each	 other’s	 hands	 off	 in friendly	 greeting,	 “and	 how	 are	 you	 all	 getting	 on	 aboard	 the	 dear	 old barquey?	I	want	to	hear	about	everybody.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Begorrah,	Dick,	give	me	toime	to	recover	me	bre’th,	me	bhoy,	an’	thin	I’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">till	ye	ivverythin’,”	and	then	he	continued	in	a	bashful	sort	of	way,	unlike</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 usual	 off-hand	 manner,	 “I’ve	 lift	 the	 say	 for	 good,	 an’	 sit	 up	 for	 a docther	ashore	on	me	own	hook,	faith.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why!”	I	exclaimed	in	great	surprise,	“how’s	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bedad,	you’d	betther	axe	y’r	sister.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What!	my	sister	Janet?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith,	yis;	the	very	same	little	darlint	of	a	colleen.	Dick,	ye	spalpeen,	jist</p>
<p class="calibre1">lit	me	shake	y’r	fist	agin,	lad.	I’m	the	happiest	man	in	the	wurrld!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whee-e-e-e-eew,”	 I	 whistled	 through	 my	 teeth.	 “This	 is	 indeed	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">surprise!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 it	 all	 came	 out,	 Garry	 telling	 a	 long	 yarn	 about	 his	 calling	 at	 my mother’s	 house	 to	 ask	 about	 me	 some	 few	 months	 back,	 and	 meeting</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	Elsie,	whom	he	had	no	difficulty	in	identifying,	he	said,	as	“the	little</p>
<p class="calibre1">girl	 of	 the	 ghost-ship,”	 though	 she	 had	 grown	 a	 bit	 taller	 and	 was	 more good-looking	 than	 he	 remembered	 her	 at	 the	 time	 he	 saw	 her	 on	 board</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 <i class="calibre4">Saint	Pierre</i>.	But,	good-looking	as	she	was,	he	did	not	think	her	to	be compared	to	my	sister	Janet,	with	whom	he	had	evidently	fallen	in	love	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">first	sight	and	very	deeply	so,	too! </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 his	 subsequently	 declaring	 his	 passion,	 impetuous	 as	 usual,	 after	 a</p>

<p class="calibre1">his	 suit	 that	 he	 should	 leave	 the	 sea,	 as	 he	 had	 another	 profession	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p217"></a>which	he	was	quite	capable	of	supporting	a	wife	as	well	as	himself,	if	he so	pleased. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Faith,	 and	 I	 wint	 an’	 bought	 a	 practis’	 at	 onst,	 havin’	 a	 snig	 little	 sum stowed	away	in	the	bank,”	continued	Garry,	“the	savin’s	of	me	pay	for	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">To	 avoid	 such	 a	 terrible	 contingency	 I	 there	 and	 then	 gave	 my	 hearty</p>
<p class="calibre1">consent	to	the	arrangement	he	and	Janet,	with	my	mother’s	concurrence, </p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 thus	 planned	 without	 my	 knowledge;	 although,	 really,	 if	 I	 had	 been inclined	 to	 grumble	 at	 not	 being	 informed	 previously	 of	 what	 now	 so</p>
<p class="calibre1">unexpectedly	 transpired,	 I	 had	 only	 time	 and	 distance	 to	 blame,	 not	 the parties	concerned,	for	the	engagement	was	of	so	recent	a	date	that	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">news	 of	 it,	 though	 on	 the	 way	 through	 the	 post,	 had	 not	 reached</p>
<p class="calibre1">Venezuela	when	I	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	I	had	answered	a	lot	of	Garry	O’Neil’s	questions	concerning	myself</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Begorrah,	ye’ll	laugh	an’	be	amused,	but	he’s	marri’d	to	a	wife	as	big	as</p>

<p class="calibre1">brides	being	given	away	respectively	by	the	skipper,	who	managed	to	run</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	  <i class="calibre4">Star	 of	 the	 North</i>	 home	 in	 time	 for	 the	 wedding,	 and	 old	 Mr	 Stokes, the	 chief	 engineer	 of	 the	 old	 barquey,	 who	 had	 only	 to	 cross	 the	 road, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p220"></a>instead	of	the	Atlantic,	to	get	to	our	house,	as	he	lived	near	to	us	now—</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 also	 was	 present.	 Captain	 Applegarth,	 who	 was	 a	 very	 old	 friend	 of my	 mother’s	 and	 a	 kind	 one	 too,	 likewise,	 lived	 in	 a	 good	 substantial house	 surrounded	 by	 a	 lovely	 garden	 in	 our	 pretty,	 picturesque,	 old</p>
<p class="calibre1">village. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	all	whom	it	may	concern,	it	may,	in	conclusion,	be	mentioned	that	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">double-barrelled	 affair	 took	 place	 in	 the	 quaint,	 old-fashioned,	 non-</p>

<p class="calibre1">few	remain	now	in	England,	situated	close	to	our	cottage,	and	where	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">widowed	mother	had,	in	our	childhood,	taught	us	to	lisp	our	first	prayers</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 heaven,	 our	 dead	 father	 resting	 in	 the	 ivy-grown	 and	 flower-adorned</p>
<p class="calibre1">graveyard	 adjoining.	 The	 nuptial	 knot	 was	 tied	 by	 Parson	 Goldwire,	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">everybody	called	him	in	the	neighbourhood,	assisted	by	Matthew	Jacon, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 equally	 elderly	 parish	 clerk,	 without	 whose	 joint	 ministration	 on	 the occasion	 neither	 Janet	 nor	 myself	 would	 have	 believed	 the	 marriage</p>
<p class="calibre1">ceremony	 had	 been	 properly	 solemnised,	 both	 my	 sister	 and	 myself</p>
<p class="calibre1">standing	in	much	awe	of	the	learned	divine	and	his	inseparable	“double,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 holding	 to	 the	 creed	 that	 the	 austere	 pair	 represented	 the	 very</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A	Presentment	of	the	Past. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 Elsie	 and	 I	 got	 “spliced,”	 to	 use	 the	 old	 familiar	 language	 of	 my boyhood,	the	expressive	 <i class="calibre4">argot</i>	of	the	sea,	for	which	I	shall	always	retain	a passionate	love,	only	second	to	that	I	bear	towards	my	dear	wife,	we	set</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	for	the	Continent,	having	determined	to	spend	the	happy	period	of	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">honeymoon	abroad,	like	the	fine	folk	of	the	fashionable	world	with	whom, </p>
<p class="calibre1">though,	 there	 is	 little	 in	 common	 between	 us,	 their	 ways	 otherwise	 not being	 our	 ways,	 nor	 their	 thoughts,	 ambitions,	 hopes	 or	 desires	 in	 any respect	akin	to	ours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First	 we	 went	 up	 the	 Seine	 to	 Rouen,	 where	 I	 had	 passed	 a	 couple	 of years	of	my	school	life,	studying	French	and	teaching	the	young	scions	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Gallic	race	with	whom	I	was	associated	for	the	time	the	exigencies	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p221"></a>football,	 as	 we	 play	 the	 game	 in	 Lancashire,	 varied	 by	 an	 occasional illustrative	exhibition	explanatory	of	the	merits	of	 <i class="calibre4">la	boxe	Anglaise</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Time	 passed	 swiftly	 with	 so	 sweet	 and	 sympathetic	 a	 companion;	 our</p>
<p class="calibre1">tastes	 were	 similar,	 both	 taking	 the	 greatest	 delight	 in	 ancient	 buildings and	 lovely	 scenery;	 the	 weather,	 too,	 was	 charming,	 and	 altogether	 we</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	as	happy	as	two	mortals	can	be	on	this	earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elsie	 and	 I	 saw	 all	 that	 was	 to	 be	 seen	 in	 the	 old	 city	 we	 first	 visited, which,	 in	 addition	 to	 its	 architectural	 beauties,	 should	 have	 a	 special charm	for	all	Englishmen	from	the	fact	of	the	dauntless	Richard	Coeur	de</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lion	having	such	an	affection	for	the	town	that	he	bequeathed	it	his	lion</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart,	 and	 then	 we	 journeyed	 on	 through	  <i class="calibre4">la	 belle	 Normandie</i>,	 loitering here	and	there	at	those	historic	spots,	woven	into	the	life	of	our	country, </p>
<p class="calibre1">spots	where	artists	of	all	nations	love	to	linger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	stayed	anon	at	slow,	sedate	Caen,	as	still	as	the	stone	for	which	it	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">celebrated,	 and	 that	 furnished	 the	 building	 material	 of	 Winchester</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cathedral;	 Bayeux,	 boastful	 of	 its	 antique	 tapestry;	 and	 Dol	 and	 Saint</p>
<p class="calibre1">Servan,	and	away	beyond,	Sainte	Michel,	so	like	and	yet	unlike	the	like-</p>
<p class="calibre1">named	Saint	Michael’s	Mount	of	Cornwall,	in	our	own	sea-girt	isle	that	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">might	 have	 been	 chipped	 out	 of	 the	 same	 block	 by	 its	 grand</p>
<p class="calibre1">handycraftsman	to	serve	as	a	replica;	until,	entering	brighter	Bretaigne,	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 sunny	 south	 of	 France,	 where	 the	 landmarks	 of	 the	 past	 seem	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">stand	out	in	bolder	relief,	we	visited	Nantes	and	other	places	of	interest, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	jogging	on	thence	through	Angouleme	and	Poictiers,	halting	a	day	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Poictiers	to	fight	our	Plantagenet	battles	o’er	again,	we	finally	ended	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">pilgrimage	at	Bordeaux. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 this	 wonderfully	 picturesque	 port,	 whose	 semi-ancient,	 quaintly</p>
<p class="calibre1">modern	 aspect	 strangely	 attracted	 us	 both,	 we	 anchored	 awhile, </p>
<p class="calibre1">remaining	many	weeks	in	excess	of	the	customary	limit	of	the	traditional</p>
<p class="calibre1">honeymoon,	 ours	 being	 an	 indefinite	 one	 and	 only	 to	 be	 completed	 we</p>
<p class="calibre1">trust,	when	Elsie	and	I	cease	to	breathe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Late	in	the	autumn,	when	the	leaves	had	begun	to	turn	russet	and	brown, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	the	air	of	a	morning	assumed	a	crisper	and	more	bracing	tone,	telling</p>
<p class="calibre1">us	plainly	as	these	signs	tell	that	summer	had	fled	for	good	and	aye,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">winter	was	coming	by-and-by,	we	bade	adieu	to	dear	old	Bordeaux,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p222"></a>taking	 a	 steamer	 there	 bound	 for	 the	 Thames,	 having	 had	 enough	 of railways	 and	 land	 travel,	 we	 started	 to	 voyage	 home	 by	 sea,	 my	 native element. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	evening	of	the	second	day	that	had	elapsed	since	losing	sight	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pointe	de	Graves	at	the	mouth	of	the	Garonne,	towards	sunset,	we	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">weathered	Ushant	and	were	shaping	a	course	up	Channel,	north	east,	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	to	clear	the	dangerous	Casquettes	rocks	of	Guernsey,	when	I	noticed</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	large	ship,	close-hauled	on	the	starboard	tack,	steaming	inwards	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">French	coast,	as	if	heading	for	Brest,	her	nearest	port. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	that	moment	the	tired	sun,	which	previously	appeared	to	linger	above</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 horizon,	 uncertain	 whether	 to	 go	 or	 to	 stay,	 dipped	 suddenly	 as	 we were	 looking	 at	 him,	 a	 pale,	 yellow	 radiance	 succeeding	 the	 dazzling</p>
<p class="calibre1">beams	 that	 had	 well-nigh	 blinded	 us,	 shining	 straight	 in	 our	 eyes,	 while the	 afterglow,	 mounting	 rapidly	 into	 the	 western	 sky,	 became	 more	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	 vivid	 each	 moment,	 two	 purple	 islands	 of	 cloud	 which	 floated</p>
<p class="calibre1">across	 this	 refulgent	 background	 having	 the	 lower	 edges	 dyed	 of	 a	 rich crimson	that	seemed	to	set	the	sea	on	fire	and	tipped	the	spars	and	sails</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	passing	ship	with	flame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	flying	the	French	Tricolor,	and	as	our	steamer	went	by,	saluting</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	with	a	couple	of	blasts	from	her	steam	whistle	in	friendly	greeting,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">stranger	vessel	as	a	return,	in	accordance	with	the	time-honoured	rule	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">nautical	 etiquette	 always	 observed	 on	 such	 occasions,	 dipped	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">ensign. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	action,	coupled	with	the	similarity	of	the	scene	and	its	surroundings, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 ship	 in	 the	 distance	 with	 her	 flag	 half	 on	 the	 hoist,	 the	 sunset	 glow, and	the	fact	of	my	being	on	board	a	steamer	then	as	now,	brought	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	my	mind	at	once	the	incidents	of	that	memorable	evening	of	the	past, </p>
<p class="calibre1">more	 than	 seven	 years	 ago	 now,	 the	  <i class="calibre4">vraisemblance</i>	 between	 the	 two being	simply	astounding! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Elsie,	 dearest	 Elsie!”	 I	 cried	 with	 a	 start,	 as	 the	 strange	 coincidence	 of the	 presentment	 struck	 me,	 the	 date	 being	 even	 identical.	 “Do	 you</p>
<p class="calibre1">remember	what	day	of	the	month	this	is,  <i class="calibre4">querida	mia</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why,	 of	 course,	 Dick,	 I	 do,”	 she	 answered,	 nestling	 up	 to	 my	 side	 as	 if</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p223"></a>for	 protection,	 for	 we	 were	 sitting	 in	 a	 warm	 corner	 by	 the	 taffrail,	 just abaft	the	wheel-house,	and	screened	from	the	observation	of	the	rest	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 passengers	 who	 were	 walking	 up	 and	 down	 the	 deck	 as	 usual	 after</p>
<p class="calibre1">dinner.	“Why,	Dick,	dear,	it’s	the	seventh	of	November,	your	birthday,	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">know;	surely	you	have	not	already	forgotten	the	little	present	I	gave	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	 morning,	 my	 likeness	 in	 a	 locket	 for	 your	 watch	 chain,	 a	 miniature done	by	that	clever	artist	at	Orleans,	and	you	told	me	you	would	always</p>
<p class="calibre1">wear	it	for	my	sake.	Dick,	my	husband,	where	is	your	memory?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	my	little	one,	I	have	not	forgotten	it,”	said	I,	kissing	her,	thinking	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	going	to	cry	at	what	she	thought	was	forgetfulness	on	my	part.	“Here</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	is	next	my	heart,	like	yourself,”	said	I	laughingly.	“But,	Elsie,  <i class="calibre4">alma	mia</i>,	I was	thinking	of	another	anniversary,	and	a	Friday	evening	too,	to	make	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	the	more	wonderful!	Don’t	you	recollect	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	Dick,	my	dear	husband,”	she	whispered,	seizing	my	arm	and	gazing</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	 over	 the	 taffrail	 at	 the	 ship,	 all	 ablaze	 now	 from	 the	 reflection	 of	 the sky,	 and	 nearly	 hull	 down	 to	 leeward.	 “I	 see,	 I	 see.	 What	 a	 strange</p>
<p class="calibre1">coincidence.	It	is	really	wonderful!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 is,	 my	 darling,”	 said	 I.	 “But	 it	 was	 more	 extraordinary	 still	 that	 you should	 have	 seen	 me	 that	 memorable	 evening,	 now	 more	 than	 seven</p>
<p class="calibre1">years	ago,	and	when	I	too	saw	the	 <i class="calibre4">Saint	Pierre</i>	with	you	on	her	deck,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	wonderful	still,	when	the	captain	and	some	of	the	crew	even	to	 <i class="calibre4">this</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">day	insist	we	were	actually	several	hundreds	of	miles	apart!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	but	you	are	near	me	now,	though,	thank	God!”	she	cried,	looking	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	my	face	with	the	most	charming	expression	of	delight,	causing	me	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 foolish	 in	 bestowing	 another	 little	 kiss	 on	 her	 upturned	 face.	 “I	 don’t know	how	it	was,	but	whether	the	ships	were	as	far	apart	as	the	captain</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	the	others	say,	or	whether	they	were	not,	I	did	see	your	ship	and	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	her,	as	I	told	my	dear,	dear	father	at	the	time,	and	he	himself	did	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe	it.	Dick,	dear,	it	must	have	been	the	gift	of	‘second	sight,’	as	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scotch	 people	 call	 it.	 There	 was	 a	 nun	 at	 the	 convent	 who	 had	 it,	 and could	tell,	so	she	said,	when	anything	was	about	to	happen	to	any	of	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">family,	though	she	couldn’t	predict	events	concerning	persons	who	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	‘blood	relations,’	as	she	termed	them.	Don’t	be	frightened	Dick,	but	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	think	that	I	must	really	possess	the	same	faculty!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p224"></a>“Well,	 if	 that	 is	 the	 case,	 sweetheart,”	 said	 I,	 “there	 must	 be	 some psychological	 affinity	 between	 us,	 and	 we	 are	 both	 endowed	 with	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same	 weird	 gift,	 although	 the	 possession	 of	 the	 same	 has	 never	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">brought	to	the	knowledge	of	us	except	on	that	one	memorable	occasion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	cannot	be	otherwise	explained;	but	the	fact	of	the	two	ships	meeting</p>
<p class="calibre1">afterwards	 may	 very	 readily	 be	 accounted	 for	 under	 the	 circumstances. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 winds	 and	 currents	 of	 the	 ocean	 drifted	 them	 together,	 like	 as	 they did	us,	dear.	Don’t	you	think	so?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	did	not	answer	for	a	moment,	and,	as	our	steamer	speeded	on	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">way,	the	glow	in	the	sky	gradually	faded	and	darkness	crept	over	the	face</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	sea,	the	flashing	light	of	Ushant	whirling	its	luminous	arms	round	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">rapid	rotation,	like	some	spectral	windmill,	away	in	the	distance	over	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">lee,	where	the	French	ship	had	long	since	disappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Presently	 my	 Elsie,	 who	 had	 been	 looking	 down	 into	 the	 now	 gloomy</p>
<p class="calibre1">depths	 alongside,	 musing	 over	 the	 bitter-sweet	 memories	 of	 the	 past, </p>
<p class="calibre1">lifted	her	eyes	to	mine,	glancing	heavenwards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 Dick,	 my	 dearest,”	 said	 she,	 speaking	 at	 last,	 a	 certain	 hesitation and	 catch	 in	 her	 throat	 and	 a	 tear	 in	 the	 broken	 intonation	 of	 her	 voice, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dick,	 I’ve	 been	 thinking	 and—and—it	 was	 a	 power	 greater	 than	 that	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	winds	and	seas	that	brought	us	together.	It	was	God!” </p>
