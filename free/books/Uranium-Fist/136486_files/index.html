<p class="calibre1">A	Fist	In	Time</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p3"></a><b class="calibre3">Preface	To	Uranium	Fist1</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">EVERY	book	that	was	ever	written	is	a	product	of	its	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	begin	life	as	an	idea	in	the	author’s	mind:	a	seed	that	takes	root,	a	quantum particle	that	detonates	into	a	universe-creating	Big	Bang.	They	take	on	a	life	of their	own,	so	that	the	author	begins	as	the	progenitor	and	ends	as	portal	for something	else	that	is	extruding	its	existence	into	our	world.	From	Mind,	to paper	through	the	medium	of	the	author’s	nervous	system	and	fingers,	books	are made	flesh	from	our	flesh	but	are	rooted	in	the	reality	and	influences	of	the	times in	which	they	are	conceived	and	gestated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	includes	works	of	science	fiction	set	in	the	future.	It	also	includes	books that	are	somehow	ahead	of	their	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently,	I	did	that	with	my	first	novel,	Uranium	Fist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	breathed	life	into	the	sheets	of	wood-pulp	and	ink,	I	was	also	creating something	written	for	the	day,	but	waiting	fallow	for	the	future	resonance	that would	beat	in	time	to	its	own	inner	tempo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	never	set	out	to	do	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	fact,	I	am	still	sceptical	that	I	did	this	in	the	first	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	frequently,	it’s	not	the	author	that	determines	such	things;	the	readers	do	that when	they	bring	themselves	to	the	words	and	read	between	the	lines	and	add their	own	interpretations	to	the	author’s	vision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	me,	Uranium	Fist	was	an	adventure	and	an	experiment.	Up	until	that	time,	I had	never	written	a	work	of	novel	proportions.	I	had	no	idea	if	I	even	possessed the	stamina	for	such	an	involved	project.	So,	the	misgivings	coupled	with	the desire	to	make	the	attempt,	played	their	part	in	the	selection	of	the	project chosen	to	be	my	first	book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	other	influences,	of	course,	that	played	their	part	in	the	idea	that would	become	Uranium	Fist.	And	they	are	essential	ingredients	to	the	story	of how	I	allegedly	penned	something	ahead	of	its	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p4"></a>In	the	early	90s,	I	was	a	student	studying	political	theory	at	Liverpool	University. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	only	been	a	writer	for	a	couple	of	years	when	I	opted	to	begin	my	first book.	Politically	idealistic,	and	attracted	to	the	hard	Left	I	wanted	to	write something	that	expressed	my	politics	as	well	as	my	literary	aspirations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	First	Gulf	War	ended,	I	longed	to	write	a	story	that	expressed	my opposition	to	that	war,	but	I	could	not	come	up	with	something	that	quite	fitted that	scenario.	Instead,	I	changed	track	and	came	up	with	a	working	class revolution	on	a	distant	Earth	colony	world.	I	chose	to	write	the	story	as	a correspondent’s	article	about	the	defeat	and	destruction	of	that	revolution.	A	kind of	John	Reed	in	space.2</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Unbeknown	to	me	at	the	time,	my	correspondent’s	surname	was	Reid.	If	that was	deliberate,	then	it	was	only	unconsciously	so.	I	didn’t	see	it	until	some	time later.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	short	story	was	an	experiment	and	didn’t	work,	but	it	was	to	this	story	that	I returned	when	I	wrote	the	novel.	That	was	in	1992.	I	continued	the	experiment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	novel	was	to	be	a	book	written	by	the	corespondent	ten	years	on	from	the revolution’s	defeat,	recounting	her	experiences	and	the	experiences	of	those involved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	followed	a	kind	of	journalistic	format,	that	was	again	experimental3	for	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	book	progressed	it	become	more	focused	on	the	correspondent,	as	she became	drawn	into	the	drama	of	which	she	was	covering	and	came	to	relate	to the	people	and	their	hopes	and	dreams. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inevitably,	the	book	was	flabby	and	over-written.	It	was	a	first	attempt	after	all, but	it	formed	the	draft	that	I	revised	some	years	later	to	develop	the	book	as	it	is now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	days	when	I	wrote	the	book,	the	Soviet	Union	had	only	just	passed	into the	dustbin	of	history.	The	Anti-Capitalist	movement	that	exploded	onto	the scene	at	Seattle	in	1999	was	still	an	unknown,	unsuspected	future	development. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	me,	it	seemed	that	I	had	to	write	a	novel	in	which	the	revolution	was destroyed.	In	part	this	was	a	reflection	of	the	time.	Added	to	that	was	a	notion	I wished	to	express	in	the	book:	that	the	capitalist	class	is	armed	to	the	teeth	with nuclear	weapons.	I	was	playing	with	the	notion	that	threatened	with	a	revolution, they	would	use	these	weapons	as	a	desperate	attempt	to	crush	any	revolutionary</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p5"></a>uprising.	Hence,	the	revolution	on	my	colony	world	of	Greyermede	was	nuked4. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among	my	influences	there	was	also	my	readings	about	the	Bolshevik Revolution.	That	revolution	was	crushed	(though	not	so	intensely	as	my	fictional one)	and	rotted	into	the	bureaucratic	state	capitalist	regime	established	under Stalin.	That	one	that	had	so	recently	collapsed	before	I	began	my	book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	also	been	influenced	by	reading	the	Iron	Heel	by	Jack	London,	and	this added	a	certain	simplistic	heroic	adventurism	to	the	tone	of	the	novel.	I	never worried	about	the	simplistic	nature	of	the	politics	of	the	book.	For	one	thing,	I had	never	written	novel,	for	another	I	was	young	and	idealistic	and	there	is nothing	inherently	wrong	with	that.	The	book	set	out	to	do	what	I	wanted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mostly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	I	forgot	about	the	book	and	moved	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	did	the	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Until	1999. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	sooner	had	I	done	the	re-write,	than	the	international	anti-capitalist movement	burst	into	the	open	at	Seattle.	The	twentieth	century	ended	with	an unprecedented	revolt	against	global	capitalism.	Suddenly	socialism	was	no longer	‘dead’;	but	a	vibrant	part	of	an	amalgam	of	opposition	that	was challenging	all	the	precepts	and	pinnacles	of	a	global	economic	system	that	was said	to	have	been	validated	beyond	all	doubt	by	the	collapse	of	‘communism’	in the	Soviet	Union. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly	radical	social	change	was	back	on	the	agenda.	And	it	followed through,	across	the	globe,	with	a	resurgence	in	radical	politics	not	seen	since	the Sixties	and	in	many	ways	never	before	seen.	The	world	was	rocking,	if	still	a long	way	from	revolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	the	world	is	still	a	long	way	from	the	kind	of	revolution	seen	in	my	book (and	of	course	it	was	fictional	and	will	bear	no	relation	to	one	in	reality),	but revolutions	grow	from	such	political	and	social	soil	as	is	being	ploughed	today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	that	brought	the	comment	that	Uranium	Fist	was	ahead	of	its	time.	It	might have	focused	on	but	one	strand	in	the	current	anti-capitalist	mood,	but	I	hinted within	that	book	at	many	more	strands.	It	has	reflected,	in	a	simple	and	perhaps</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p6"></a>naive	form,	the	anti-capitalist	movement	that	has	emerged	so	dramatically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Uranium	Fist	was	and	is	an	anti-capitalist	novel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	that	sense,	I	guess	it’s	true	that	it	was	ahead	of	its	time,	though	I	will	forever remain	sceptical	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	said,	I	trust	that	one	part	at	least	will	never	be	ahead	of	its	time	nor contemporary,	but	remain	a	fantasy	—	and	that	is	that	nuclear	weapons	will never	be	used	to	suppress	humanity’s	desire	for	social	justice	and	freedom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	they	all	too	easily	could	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here’s	to	the	future.	Here’s	to	being	ahead	of	times.	Here’s	to	a	better	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	by	some	miracle,	Uranium	Fist	can	play	a	part,	however	small	and	trivial,	then I	shall	be	pleased.	But	I	must	emphasis	it	remains	what	it	always	was	—	a	novel and	(I	hope)	a	damn	good	story. </p>

<p class="calibre1">COMING	SOON…</p>
<p class="calibre1">Presented	By	Writers	of	Worlds:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	Novels	By	Mark	Cantrell</p>
<p class="calibre1">CITIZEN	ZERO</p>
<p class="calibre1">SINCE	the	early	decades	of	the	21st	Century,	when	society	was	scarred	by	the traumas	of	globalisation	and	a	protracted	war	on	terror,	Britain	has	become	a peaceful	and	prosperous	consumer	society. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Historians	are	already	talking	of	a	Golden	Age,	but	under	the	security-driven authoritarian	regime	of	Alexander	Carlisle	-	Britain’s	longest	serving	PM	-	they know	not	to	say	anything	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	this	Golden	Age	masks	a	rotten	core	-	and	it	is	about	to	come	crashing down. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a>On	the	fringes	of	society	are	the	‘zeros’	-	the	poor,	the	unemployed,	the	destitute</p>
<p class="calibre1">-	who	paid	the	price	for	society’s	affluence.	Lurking	in	their	midst	is	Clute,	one of	Carlisle’s	former	comrades-in-arms	who	helped	him	seize	power.	He	has turned	self-styled	prophet	of	revolution,	but	behind	his	rhetoric	of	a	better	world is	a	nihilistic	vision	of	apocalyptic	proportions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clute	is	about	to	destroy	the	technological	chains	of	social	control	by	attacking its	weakest	point.	In	so	doing,	the	zeros	will	be	unleashed	to	rampage	through the	consumer	citadels	in	an	orgy	of	violent	rage.	So	will	begin	a	catastrophic struggle	between	society	and	those	it	exiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">David	Mills	is	about	to	become	a	central	player	in	this	world-shattering	power struggle.	He	is	a	zero,	ordered	to	take	part	in	the	JobNet	global	recruitment scheme.	To	begin	with,	it	seems	to	fulfil	all	its	promise	as	he	finds	a	woman	to love	and	prospects	for	a	better	life	through	this	artificial	world,	then	it	all	goes insane	and	he	is	struggling	to	save	both	his	sanity	and	his	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unbeknown	to	him,	he	was	used	to	carry	a	deadly	virus	into	the	heart	of	the global	network’s	weakest	link	-	JobNet.	Now	the	virus	is	spreading,	corrupting, destroying	all	the	technology	that	kept	the	zeros	down	throughout	the	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	Mills	is	struggling	to	exist	all	over	again,	the	real	world	is	burning	in	civil war	and	he	has	become	the	focus	of	a	desperate	manhunt	by	Government	forces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	they	can	find	his	‘kidnapped’	body	or	his	projection	in	AR,	then	they	hope	to destroy	the	virus	at	source.	It	is	a	desperate	gambit	in	a	desperate	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet	again,	Mills	is	the	victim	of	forces	beyond	his	control	or	knowledge,	but	this time	-	if	he	survives	-	he	can	be	a	force	for	change.	From	being	nothing,	Mills has	become	everything;	he	can	save	the	world.	There’s	only	one	problem	-	he might	have	to	destroy	it	first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">SILAS	MORLOCK</p>
<p class="calibre1">TERAPOLIS	is	an	urban	sprawl	of	global	proportions;	its	flesh	and	bone	towers breach	even	the	oceans’	restless	barriers	and	forever	shield	humanity	from	the light	of	day.	The	city	has	subsumed	the	great	conurbations	of	history,	absorbed whole	nations,	embalmed	entire	continents…</p>
<p class="calibre1">Here,	in	the	neon-lit	avenues	and	shaded	alleys,	the	populace	pursues	the	endless and	morbid	pursuit	of	fleshly	pleasures:	anything	that	drowns	the	spark	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>Selfhood	until	it	can	be	released	into	the	mysterious	and	much-craved	Gestalt-state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	chimerical	technology	is	the	gift	of	Silas	Morlock,	the	enigmatic	and reclusive	head	of	MorTek.	Now,	as	Morlock	contemplates	the	completion	of	his life’s	work,	he	is	disturbed	to	learn	of	the	return	of	an	ancient	scourge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hiding	in	the	shadows	of	his	city,	an	organisation	known	only	as	the	Incunabula has	resurrected	an	ancient	and	powerful	drug.	Slowly,	its	malign	influence	is spreading	like	a	plague	-	and	it	is	literally	a	poison	to	the	Gestalt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	is	hope	yet	in	the	form	of	Adam,	one	of	the	dealer	Caxton’s	prime contacts.	He	is	a	misfit	and	a	dreamer,	an	unlikely	saviour	indeed,	torn	between the	cravings	for	the	Gestalt	and	his	burning	addiction	to	Caxton’s	merchandise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	Adam	is	destined	to	become	a	pawn	played	by	both	sides	in	an	ancient struggle,	for	Caxton	is	more	than	just	a	dealer;	he	knows	the	true	nature	of	the Gestalt	and	he	knows	Morlock.	The	two	share	an	old	enmity	that	transcends even	life	and	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	conflict	will	take	Adam	into	the	heart	of	darkness,	where	he	is	doomed	to learn	the	secret	of	the	Gestalt	for	himself.	The	discovery	could	cost	him	his	Soul, but	if	he	can	overcome	the	horror	then	he	might	just	save	Humanity	from itself…</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	shadows	at	the	heart	of	darkness,	Adam	must	find	himself…	or	be	worse than	Damned.	So	begins	the	final	battle	for	possession	of	the	Human	Soul. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a><b class="calibre3">Prologue</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">WHEN	Edward	Wilton	stepped	out	of	his	front	door,	there	was	nothing	to	show that	the	day	would	be	anything	but	ordinary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	a	fine	summer’s	day.	The	air	tasted	good,	with	the	morning’s	first ejaculation	of	pollen.	The	wind	brought	with	it	the	heavy	tang	of	a	summer storm,	of	moisture	laden	air,	but	the	clouds	were	still	brooding	over	the	distant hills	that	overlooked	the	city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	might	take	that	broiling	mass	of	highly	charged	air	as	a	bad	sign.	Not Edward.	Ever	since	he	could	remember,	he	loved	the	exhilaration	of	a	good thunderstorm.	Even	now,	he	could	feel	that	energy	building	up	inside	his	own body,	crackling	down	his	nerves	to	power	up	his	own	sense	of	excitement.	And when	the	clouds	unleashed	their	pent	up	rage,	it	brought	a	sense	of	euphoria,	of revelry	in	the	power	of	nature;	storms	were	a	heavenly	symphony	of	the elements. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Daddy!	Daddy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rebecca	hurled	herself	towards	him	with	the	tempestuous	enthusiasm	that	only	a six-year-old	can	muster.	She	slammed	into	his	knees	with	a	force	that	almost knocked	him	to	the	ground,	but	he	used	that	childish	momentum	to	sweep	his little	girl	into	his	arms	and	lift	her	high.	She	giggled	and	wriggled,	and	released the	laughter	from	his	own	heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	followed	at	a	more	sedate	pace	from	the	cool	interior	of	the	house.	She folded	her	arms,	leaned	against	the	doorframe	and	smiled.	“Careful,	darling! </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s	not	as	young	as	he	used	to	be.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	as	old,	surely,”	he	said,	adopting	a	mock	frown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled	with	a	mischievous	twinkle	in	her	eyes	and	mouthed	her	love	for him.	He	pulled	his	daughter	close	and	moved	to	put	his	free	arm	around	Sara’s waist.	She	felt	good	as	she	moved	closer,	and	the	smell	of	her	showered	and perfumed	body	added	nuance	to	the	passionate	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	kissed	her	with	a	lingering	motion.	“Love	you!”	Then	he	turned	and	pecked</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>his	daughter	on	the	cheek.	“And	you!”	Rebecca	giggled	loudly	and	wriggled until	she	was	in	her	mother’s	arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Part	of	his	mind	whispered	that	he	was	too	old	for	this	kind	of	display.	The warmth	inside	his	heart	said	otherwise.	Meeting	Sara	was	the	best	thing	that	ever happened	to	him.	Rebecca’s	arrival	completed	the	entirety	of	his	newfound happiness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Until	he	met	Sara,	he	never	realised	there	was	a	gap	in	his	life,	or	that	he	was unhappy.	As	a	young	man,	he	had	always	felt	awkward	around	women,	never sure	how	to	handle	himself.	Quite	unlike	the	self-assured	man	he	was	in	business and	commercial	circles</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	result	was	he	never	found	anyone,	and	eventually	concluded	he	never would.	Unlike	his	peers	-	who	married,	divorced	and	grew	bitter	-	he	threw himself	into	his	career,	and	climbed	the	ranks.	Then	-	unexpectedly	-	he	met Sara.	She	was	one	of	the	young	analysts.	She	worked	for	him	in	a	distant	kind	of way,	and	he	never	knew	of	her	existence	until	they	met	in	a	lift	of	all	places,	both going	to	their	respective	departments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which	floor?”	she	politely	enquired,	taking	him	for	just	another	of	the	middle managers.	When	he	told	her,	she	became	obviously	nervous.	How	often	had	she accompanied	senior	management,	let	alone	the	vice	president	of	the	bank	-	as	he was	then	-	on	their	way	to	the	upper	echelons	of	power? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	about	her	manner	amused	him	and	he	found	himself	automatically trying	to	make	her	feel	at	ease.	It	proved	difficult	to	prise	conversation	out	of her;	not	that	she	wasn’t	talking,	quite	the	contrary.	He	recognised	the	interview-speak	immediately,	the	well	considered	words,	chosen	to	convey	a	striking image	of	the	speaker,	without	saying	anything	that	might	be	turned	around	and thrown	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	they	arrived	at	her	floor,	he	held	the	lift	for	a	while	so	he	could	continue the	conversation.	It	was	innocent	enough,	but	he	still	had	his	position	to consider.	Offices	were	terrible	rumour	machines.	He	kept	their	conversation	as business-like	as	possible,	trying	to	convey	the	image	of	management	taking	a friendly	-	but	platonic	interest	-	in	a	new	staff	member.	Yet,	he	knew	there	was something	more.	He	was	amazed	to	find	himself	assessing	Sara	at	more	than	the professional	level.	What’s	more,	he	felt	her	assessing	him	in	the	same	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>On	impulse,	he	asked	her	to	lunch.	She	turned	him	down,	with	what	seemed	like a	trivial	excuse.	After	the	initial	dismay,	he	found	himself	both	amused	and intrigued.	Later,	he	found	an	invitation	to	lunch	on	his	internal	mail.	For	the	look of	it,	he	left	the	reply	for	a	couple	of	days	before	accepting	the	proposal.	Sara’s voice	was	filled	with	a	mixture	of	surprise	and	nervousness.	Edward	discovered an	entirely	new	avenue	in	life	-	what’s	more	he	found	himself	enjoying	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	really	must	be	going,	Sir.”	Jenkins	suddenly	pulled	him	from	the	depths	of fond	memories,	snapping	smartly	to	attention.	Edward	sighed	inwardly.	Duty called.	Irksome	to	be	so	reminded	by	the	staff.	He	casually	acknowledged	his chauffeur	and	turned	to	kiss	Sara	goodbye.	She	murmured	her	appreciation, while	her	wandering	hands	promised	him	a	warm	welcome	on	his	return. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reluctantly,	he	broke	off	and	strolled	towards	the	car.	Jenkins	held	the	door	for him.	He	took	his	usual	glance	back	to	his	young	family	before	sliding	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bye,	bye,	Daddy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bye,	Darling.	See	you	soon!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	waved	back	until	the	smoked	glass	window	obscured	him	from	his	family’s view.	He	continued	to	watch	them	through	the	glass.	Sara	took	hold	of	Rebecca’s hand	and	took	her	back	into	the	house	to	get	ready	for	school.	Rebecca	hopped and	skipped	by	her	mother’s	side	and	Edward	felt	the	smile	warm	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	smooth	interior	of	the	limousine	felt	cool	and	refreshing.	The	faint	scent	of leather	tantalised	his	nose,	adding	nuance	to	the	summer	flavours	still	lingering in	the	air	from	outside.	He	settled	into	the	seat	and	flicked	open	his	briefcase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rebecca’s	latest	painting	from	school	greeted	him	with	its	childish	hues	and	a six-year-old’s	strange	perception	of	the	human	body.	Lifting	the	picture,	he	held it	up	to	the	light	and	gently	nodded	his	head.	It	would	make	a	good	addition	to the	gallery	developing	in	his	office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Edward	felt	the	car	rock	slightly	with	the	chauffeur’s	weight	and	he	sighed	at	the prospect	of	another	day	in	the	office.	Perhaps	he	would	phone	home	later,	and arrange	to	meet	Sara	for	an	extended	lunch.	They	could	take	in	a	gallery	or	two, or	go	to	the	theatre.	Edward	reached	out	to	close	his	briefcase;	his	movement synchronised	with	the	driver’s	motion	to	touch	the	ignition	stud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	very	last	thing	Edward	saw	was	the	light	rushing	to	engulf	him	as	an</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>explosion	smothered	the	two	human	occupants	in	a	ball	of	fire.	The	pressure mingled	the	two	men’s	remains	over	the	neighbourhood.	Only	close	forensic examination	ensured	the	right	remains	ended	up	in	the	right	graves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rebecca	and	Sara	came	running	out	of	the	house	to	find	burning	debris	scattered on	the	lawn.	The	child	stared	at	the	dying	embers	of	her	father’s	life	and	asked where	Daddy	had	gone.	Sara	couldn’t	answer,	only	scream	as	she	took	in	the wreckage	of	her	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Days	later,	they	found	the	charred	drawing	lodged	in	the	branches	of	a	tree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">TO	this	day,	nobody	knows	who	planted	the	bomb	that	killed	Edward	Wilton. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	mystery	is	how	the	assassins	managed	to	penetrate	the	security	that	was an	ever	present	and	largely	invisible	shield	around	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	aftermath	of	the	bombing,	Martial	Law	was	hurriedly	declared.	The	police and	the	local	militia	brutally	cracked	down	on	all	forms	of	opposition.	A	wave	of fear	gripped	Greyermede,	already	depressed	share	values	slumped	even	further, and	the	whole	planet	held	its	breath	as	it	pondered	what	-	or	who	-	would	be next. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perpetrators	needed	to	be	found.	That	was	the	only	certainty.	Politics	played	its part,	and	an	enemy	was	quickly	found	and	accused.	A	hitherto	little	known political	party	shot	to	the	front	pages.	For	the	first	time,	much	of	Middle Greyermede	heard	the	name	of	the	Greyermede	Communist	Party	(GCP). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Assassinations	were	nothing	new.	There	had	been	a	spate	of	them	in	recent years.	None	of	them	had	involved	such	high	profile	figures	as	Edward	Wilton; the	slaying	of	the	President	of	the	Central	Bank	sent	shockwaves	that	would inevitably	be	felt	throughout	the	colonies	to	reach	the	Mother	World	itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	it	began,	but	just	then,	nobody	knew	what	was	about	to	engulf	humanity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">WHAT	erupted	on	Greyermede	and	further	afield,	is	merely	a	chapter	in	the	age-old	human	story.	It	began	long	ago	on	a	distant	world	on	the	rim	of	the	galaxy we	call	the	Milky	Way.	Ten	millennia	of	civil	war	took	humanity	to	the	stars;	and to	new	worlds	on	which	to	enact	this	Trans-millennial	drama. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Too	long	in	the	distant	past	for	this	book.	We	must	start	much	later.	The beginning	could	be	said	to	have	arrived	before	Edward’s	untimely	demise; </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>emerging	from	the	economic	turbulence	sweeping	the	advanced	worlds	and	the political	tremors	that	followed	in	its	wake.	Even	that	is	far	too	early	for	our	story to	begin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	end	of	Edward	Wilton	must	be	our	beginning.	His	assassination	was	a	point of	change,	a	qualitative	shift	in	the	pattern	of	events	that	would	touch	everybody on	this	world	-	and	many	more	beyond.	The	storm	had	broken,	in	an	unexpected place,	and	it	was	the	tempest	of	an	age-old	human	dream	leaping	into	flesh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tempest	Rising</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	1</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">THEY	were	waiting	for	me	by	the	time	I	arrived.	Rob	Nidel	looked	up	as	I approached	the	table.	David	Carter	was	deep	in	conversation	with	Omar	Nkruma and	didn’t	notice	me	until	I	sat	down	and	pulled	the	ashtray	towards	me.	He smiled	half-heartedly,	and	then	turned	back	to	his	conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Angela	looked	up	from	whatever	private	thoughts	were	occupying	her	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	Sue,”	she	said	quietly.	There	was	little	enthusiasm	in	her	voice.	I wondered	if	she	was	having	second	thoughts	about	the	interview. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nkruma	played	with	his	lighter	and	watched	me	with	his	unfathomable	dark eyes.	His	were	the	most	inexpressive	features	I	have	ever	seen.	Quite	unlike Carter,	dwarfed	by	Nkruma’s	bear-like	frame,	who	had	an	animated	-	if	gaunt	-</p>
<p class="calibre1">face	when	he	got	going.	With	David,	a	recorder	was	essential	-	no	journalist’s shorthand	was	ever	designed	to	keep	up	with	him	in	full	flow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today	he	was	not	so	expressive.	His	conversation	with	Nkruma	was	low	and half-hearted.	They	all	seemed	reticent	to	talk.	The	atmosphere	around	the	table was	subdued	as	they	all	explored	memories,	some	joyful,	others	they	preferred	to forget.	Seeing	me	to	talk	about	their	experiences	was	difficult.	I	appreciated	their pain,	but	I	don’t	think	I	ever	really	told	them	how	grateful	I	was	that	they	agreed to	see	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	presence	in	that	quiet	little	cafe	in	Mars	Central	was	a	testimony	to	the inner	strength	that	took	them	through	a	difficult	period.	That	same	strength enabled	them	to	face	the	memories,	and	share	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	of	them	-	David	and	Angela	for	instance	-	I	knew	from	my	time	on Greyermede.	That	helped	them	to	take	me	into	their	confidence.	Others	I’d	met while	researching	this	book,	but	they	extended	the	same	trust	as	the	others.	To look	at,	they	didn’t	seem	like	people	who	once	shook	the	stars	to	their	cores,	or gripped	by	the	throat	a	system	that	had	wrought	the	iron	chains	of	capitalism across	interstellar	distances.	They	look	like	ordinary	people,	because	that’s exactly	what	they	are. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ordinary	people,	however,	that	have	seen	-	and	sometimes	participated	in	-</p>
<p class="calibre1">terrible	things.	None	of	them	were	keen	to	talk	about	what	they	have	seen	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>done.	In	that,	they	share	something	in	common	with	soldiers	down	the	ages.	A kind	of	modesty,	perhaps,	or	a	reluctance	to	dwell	on	things	that	the	human	mind was	never	truly	built	to	comprehend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	found	plenty	of	boasters	while	researching	this	book.	Or	more	accurately,	they found	me.	They’d	been	there,	done	that,	seen	this.	But	there	was	nothing	very convincing	about	their	ebullience,	and	it	quickly	became	apparent	that	these people	were	just	living	a	dream,	some	fantasy	to	bolster	their	own inconsequential	lives.	Eventually,	I	could	spot	these	time	wasters	before	they even	opened	their	mouths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	people	in	the	cafe	were	different.	It	took	me	months	to	gain	their	trust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	it	all	started,	I	was	another	jobbing	hack,	earning	my	keep	by	writing about	the	strange	and	the	unusual	on	the	colonies.	I	was	a	planet-hopper,	moving from	one	world	to	the	next	in	search	of	a	story.	I	worked	for	the	liberal	Martian Chronicle,	a	vaguely	left-leaning	publication	that	had	a	reputation	for	pissing	off the	rich	and	powerful.	Like	most	reputations,	it	was	overblown,	but	its	pages	had room	for	the	radical.	It	made	it	a	good	home	for	my	work,	and	I	owe	it	a	lot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	least,	I	owe	it	for	sending	me	to	Greyermede	when	the	story	really	exploded and	nobody	could	fail	to	hear	about	a	world	that	was	once	an	unheard	of backwater	outside	of	the	trade	papers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	as	a	reporter,	excited	by	a	great	story	-	a	career	maker	for	sure	-	but	no more.	I	left	with	much	more.	For	one	thing,	I	was	no	longer	that	distant	hack, aloof	and	unconcerned	about	the	lives	I	touched.	The	people	and	the	events	I went	to	witness	as	a	passive	bystander	moved	me	more	than	anything	else	I	ever witnessed.	The	drama	drew	me	in,	until	I	became	one	with	the	hopes	and aspirations	of	the	human	race.	No	longer	was	I	the	wandering	dilettante.	I	found a	metaphorical	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	a	hard	lesson	for	a	reporter	to	learn;	that	we	touch	and	affect	the	lives	that	we record.	To	say	we	are	not	involved	is	a	cop	out.	We	are	involved.	Our	capacity	to shape	perceptions	is	powerful,	and	we	bear	a	terrible	duty	to	dig	out	the	truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	is	our	self-proclaimed	conviction,	our	honour	and	our	prestige.	We	have made	the	truth	our	raison	d’?tre	-	but	how	many	of	us	really	practice	what	we preach? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Truth	is	not	a	neutral	force.	Objectivity	and	a	lack	of	bias	mean	dealing	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>truth,	sifting	out	those	trails	and	following	them	wherever	they	lead.	Once	we reach	that	goal,	or	as	close	to	it	as	we	can	possibly	get,	as	objective	reporters	we have	a	duty	to	report	it,	to	share	it,	to	spread	the	word.	Truth	takes	sides.	To stand	aside	as	an	‘objective’	observer	is	to	stand	aside	from	the	truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knew	all	this,	and	yet	I	knew	nothing.	On	Greyermede,	I	was	taught	this	lesson anew.	The	message	was	rammed	home,	and	it	changed	me	forever.	My	life would	never	be	the	same	again,	just	as	those	who	struggled	around	me	would also	never	be	the	same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	people	sat	around	this	table	helped	me	to	find	myself,	even	as	they	struggled to	find	themselves.	Every	one	of	them	had	risen	together	to	transform	their world,	and	in	the	process	had	changed	themselves.	Humanity	unbound	is	a powerful	force	for	change;	together	we	can	shake	the	heavens	and	make	the worlds	anew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">WHEN	the	heavens	first	rumbled,	however,	I	was	elsewhere.	On	Calisto,	if memory	serves	me	right,	then	Proxima.	Greyermede	was	a	place	I	had	never heard	of.	When	it	exploded,	the	entire	galaxy	suddenly	awoke	to	discover	the importance	of	this	relatively	prosperous,	but	quiet	little	colony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	missed	the	beginning.	Carter,	Nkruma,	Nidel	and	the	others	were	to	take	me back	to	that	fateful	beginning,	and	give	a	sense	of	what	it	was	like	to	be	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking	out	my	recorder,	I	set	it	down	on	the	table.	They	all	stared	at	it,	as	if	the thing	was	a	grenade	that	might	go	off	at	any	moment.	In	a	way	it	was;	a	bomb	of ideas	waiting	to	detonate	in	the	collective	human	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	an	uncomfortable	silence,	they	reluctantly	began	to	talk. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	2</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">UNUSUALLY,	Angela	broke	the	silence	first.	“The	morning	after	they	declared Martial	Law,	Firsthaven	was	a	hive	of	activity,”	she	said.	“We’d	expected	the city	to	be	quiet,	but	when	we	walked	through	Commerce	Square	during	lunch, Colony	House	looked	ready	for	a	siege,	and	by	the	looks	of	the	crowd	gathered outside,	that’s	just	what	was	going	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	were	they	doing?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	much,	just	standing	around.	It	all	looked	so	relaxed,	though	we	couldn’t	see a	lot	from	across	the	square.	Some	of	the	crowd	was	chanting	and	waving placards,	but	most	of	the	people	there	were	just	curious	bystanders.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">ANGELA	paused,	as	if	having	second	thoughts,	or	just	to	take	stock.	She	took	a sip	of	water	and	then	turned	to	face	Nkruma.	“Got	any	of	those	going	spare?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	at	the	cigarette	packet	in	his	hand,	and	then	silently	offered	it	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	Angela	took	one	of	the	cigarettes,	he	took	one	himself	and	both	lit	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Angela	exhaled	the	smoke	in	satisfaction,	she	looked	as	though	she’d needed	a	cigarette	for	some	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	supposed	to	be	quitting,”	she	said,	glancing	at	the	glowing	tip	and shrugging.	“But	what	the	Hell?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	took	another	long,	thoughtful	drag	and	continued	with	her	tale.	“The	crowd turned	out	to	be	journalists.	They	were	protesting	against	the	media	restrictions the	Government	imposed.	There	must	have	been	about	fifty	of	them	altogether. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	could	see	the	guards	better	now.	They	were	militiamen,	and	they	seemed uneasy	about	the	situation.	I	don’t	think	they	knew	what	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Dutton’s	attempt	to	control	the	media	is	a	direct	attempt	to	control	public thought,’	one	of	the	demonstrators	yelled.	‘He’s	trying	to	monopolise	debate	and stamp	out	the	desire	for	independence.	But	let	me	tell	you	this	-	he	won’t succeed!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	crowd	cheered. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>“‘I	have	letters	of	support	from	the	union	Federation,	and	from	the	important opposition	groups.	They	too	are	opposed	to	these	media	restrictions,	and	support us	in	our	campaign.	They’re	all	feeling	the	heel	of	Colonial	tyranny,	but	they	are fighting	on	and	are	working	to	form	a	multi-party	committee	to	discuss	the election	of	a	-‘</p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	riot	cop	appeared	from	nowhere	and	grabbed	the	man	in	a	headlock.	More black-clad	cops	swarmed	through	the	crowd.	Confusion	erupted.	Screams echoed	from	the	buildings.	Angry	shouts.	People	were	clubbed	to	the	ground.	It didn’t	matter	if	they	were	demonstrators	or	passers	by,	the	police	smashed	into them	all.	Others	ran	in	panic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	didn’t	take	long	to	smash	the	demonstration.	We	joined	the	last	of	the stragglers	in	the	run	for	safety.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“TRAFALGAR	was	little	better,”	Nkruma	said.	“The	militia	was	out	on	the streets.	We	treated	them	warily.	Nobody	was	sure	about	their	attitude	towards independence,	but	I	know	that	some	people	tried	to	draw	them	out	them	in conversation.	It	wasn’t	something	I	could	do;	the	police	are	bad	enough,	but soldiers	really	scare	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	were	you	doing	at	the	time?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Avoiding	the	police!”	he	laughed.	“I’d	been	made	redundant	about	three months	before	all	this	happened.	I	had	time	on	my	hands,	and	in	the	political climate	I	gravitated	towards	the	Workers’	Democratic	Front	(WDF).	After	the announcement	of	Martial	Law,	I	was	scared	and	wanted	to	know	what	we	should be	doing,	so	I	hurried	to	the	WDF	party	offices.	The	new	paper	had	just	come out	and	we	were	going	to	try	to	sell	as	many	as	we	could	before	the	police stopped	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Before	I	got	to	our	party	office,	I	could	already	hear	a	commotion.	Voices argued.	People	were	screaming,	I	couldn’t	tell	if	it	was	in	fear	or	anger,	but	I	was tempted	to	turn	back	and	go	home.	I	didn’t	fancy	being	caught	up	some	kind	of police	action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An	unmarked	van	skidded	round	the	corner	and	tumbled	on	its	side.	Sirens suddenly	echoed	through	the	urban	canyons.	I	stood	stunned,	not	knowing	what to	do.	Moments	later,	the	driver	crawled	out	of	the	wrecked	vehicle.	He	was covered	in	blood	and	swayed	groggily.	Then	a	patrol	car	skidded	round	a	corner</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>and	slammed	into	the	concussion-drunk	man.	The	car	skidded	to	a	halt,	rolling the	man	underneath	it	like	a	broken	doll. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	scared.	They’d	just	killed	a	man.	They	must	have	seen	me.	I	ducked	into the	cover	of	a	factory	doorway	anyway,	and	cowered	on	the	ground.	I	was shaking,	my	teeth	were	chattering,	and	the	noise	seemed	terribly	loud.	Car	doors banged.	Glass	crunched	under	booted	feet,	then	I	heard	something	thrown	onto the	road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Carefully,	I	peered	round	the	wall.	The	ruined	van	was	being	ransacked.	One	of the	officers	threw	bundles	of	newspapers	onto	the	ground.	The	other	stacked them	in	a	pile	before	setting	light	to	the	lot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	watched	-	still	shaking	-	from	the	cover	of	the	doorway	until	the	cops	left, then	I	crept	cautiously	to	the	junction	with	the	next	street.	The	office	was	being ransacked,	its	display	windows	shattered.	Amongst	the	shards	of	glass	was	a broken	word-processor	and	the	desk	that	the	police	must	have	thrown	through the	plate-glass.	Then	I	saw	Sara,	one	of	my	comrades,	as	she	was	dragged	out	of the	building	and	thrown	to	the	ground.	She	landed	on	the	glass	shards	and	was badly	cut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Drop	that	or	I’ll	drop	you!’	a	cop	barked	at	a	man	in	an	office	worker’s	cheap suit.	He	held	a	lump	of	broken	paving	stone	and	was	about	to	throw	it.	Others followed	his	lead.	More	flagstones	were	ripped	up	to	provide	ammunition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘I	warned	you!’	The	cop	pulled	out	a	tazer	and	fired.	The	office	worker	dropped to	the	ground	in	spasm,	silencing	the	enraged	crowd.	I	didn’t	know	if	they	were going	to	disperse,	or	riot,	but	the	atmosphere	was	intense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘All	of	you,	go	home!	This	office	has	been	closed	by	order	of	the	Government’s emergency	powers.	If	you	don’t	disperse	you	will	be	arrested.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“More	police	came	to	the	door	and	stared	at	the	angry	crowd.	One	them	began	to speak	into	his	radio,	I	knew	that	meant	riot	cops,	but	the	rest	of	the	crowd ignored	it.	One	of	the	cops	walked	a	few	paces	towards	us.	With	one	hand resting	on	a	hip,	legs	apart,	he	pointed	his	baton	at	the	crowd	and	angrily	told them	to	disperse.	The	crowd	ignored	him.	That	pose	of	authority	made	no impression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Cops	go	home!’	someone	cried,	followed	by	the	rest	of	the	crowd	as	they	took</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>up	the	chant.	Someone	threw	a	stone	at	the	leader.	He	went	down,	the	side	of	his face	smeared	with	blood.	Everything	went	crazy.	Stones	pelted	the	police.	They tried	to	duck	into	the	building	for	cover,	but	the	crowd	surged	forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	distant	wailing	made	itself	heard	above	the	noise	of	the	fighting.	Two	black vans	clad	in	steel	mesh	slammed	into	the	body	of	the	riot.	People	fell	through	the air	and	writhed	on	the	tarmac.	Hordes	of	black-uniformed,	amour-clad	cops rushed	out	of	the	vans	and	without	a	word	they	charged	at	us.	I	was	caught	in	the middle	of	a	pitch-battle	as	the	police	hammered	anyone	in	their	way.	With	club and	shield	they	smashed	people	to	the	ground.	People	were	dragged	away, bruised	and	bleeding,	to	be	thrown	into	the	waiting	vans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	the	crowd	fought	back.	It	was	getting	too	dangerous	there.	Hastily	I	pushed my	way	through	the	struggling	figures	and	tried	to	get	clear	of	the	fighting.	A riot	cop	appeared	in	front	of	me.	He	grinned	like	a	madman,	the	gleam	of	joy	in his	eyes	truly	frightening.	With	a	blow	from	his	riot	shield	he	knocked	me	to	the ground	and	I	felt	a	hefty	kick.	I	curled	into	a	ball	to	protect	myself	from	the expected	beating,	but	nothing	more	came.	The	tables	had	turned	and	the	cop	was no	longer	smiling.	I	crawled	away	quickly,	frightened	that	I	would	be	trampled in	the	confusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“After	some	effort	I	managed	to	push	my	way	through	to	the	pavement,	where	I leaned	heavily	against	a	wall.	Once	I	got	my	breath	back	I	started	to	make	my way	down	the	street,	desperately	trying	to	avoid	the	attentions	of	any	more	cops. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	old	man	appeared	for	a	moment	in	a	gap	in	the	crowds,	he	looked	terrified	-	a passer-by	that	stopped	to	watch	the	commotion	and	then	found	himself	caught up	as	things	turned	ugly.	I	looked	on	in	outrage	as	a	cop	appeared	and	punched him	savagely	in	the	face.	Down	he	fell,	and	the	cop	kicked	him	in	the	stomach.	I rushed	over	to	the	old	man	as	fast	as	I	could.	He	was	babbling	where	he	lay,	‘I’m not	involved…’	he	said,	‘I’m	an	old	man.	I’m	not	involved.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	tried	to	pick	him	up	and	help	him	away	but	a	gloved	hand	grabbed	the	collar of	my	jacket	and	I	was	roughly	dragged	to	my	feet.	Another	cop	rushed	over	and grabbed	me	in	a	headlock	before	I	could	do	anything.	Screaming	abuse,	the	cops dragged	me	towards	a	waiting	van	and	roughly	manhandled	me	into	the	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	last	thing	I	saw	before	they	slammed	the	door	was	a	group	of	young militiamen.	They	were	frightened	youths,	called	up	for	routine	compulsory service.	They	didn’t	know	what	to	make	of	the	situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>“As	for	the	old	man,	he	was	left	to	bleed	on	the	street!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	3</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">OVER	the	next	few	days,	these	ugly	scenes	were	repeated	all	over	Greyermede as	the	police	ransacked	party	offices	and	shut	down	opposition	newspapers.	Not all	these	actions	produced	riots.	For	the	most	part	crowds	gathered	round	to abuse	the	police.	Otherwise,	the	police	were	little	hindered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	was	striking	about	the	riots	that	did	occur	was	their	cross-class	nature.	All social	groups	were	united	together	to	resist	the	government	clampdown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whatever	their	differences,	working	class	and	middle	class,	small	businessman, and	Greyermede	capitalist,	all	united	against	a	common	foe:	Terran	capital,	the Colonial	regime,	and	its	machinery	of	oppression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Revolutions	often	begin	with	such	a	honeymoon	period.	When	all	classes	are united	against	their	immediate	enemy.	During	such	a	period,	the	class	struggle	is focused	on	the	governmental	machinery	of	the	old	order.	Not	until	this	has	been dealt	with	does	the	class	struggle	boil	over	between	the	different	factions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Greyermede	had	not	yet	reached	this	phase.	The	working	class	and	the	middle class	organisations	began	to	come	together	in	alliance	against	the	Government, temporarily	forgetting	their	differences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	working	class	did	not	trust	their	middle	class	allies,	while	the	latter	hoped	to nullify	what	they	considered	the	excesses	of	working	class	aims,	and	bring	them into	line	behind	an	independent	capitalist	programme.	But	for	now	the	different class	interests	were	submerged	beneath	the	need	to	deal	with	an	oppressive Terran-backed	state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	developing	Opposition	Coalition	lost	little	time	in	taking	to	the	streets	to demonstrate	against	martial	law,	while	strike	activity	escalated	across	the	planet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet,	there	were	no	clashes	with	the	militia.	These	armed	troops	assumed	a	more prominent	position,	but	they	did	little	more	than	assist	the	police	in	their mundane	duties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	riot	cops	and	the	CIS5	conducted	most	of	the	counter-insurgency	operations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	militia	was	an	unknown	quantity.	What	were	its	views	-	would	it	remain loyal	to	the	government?	Would	it	open	fire	on	the	people?	These	were	the	sort of	questions	being	discussed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>“BY	May,	the	Government	was	as	isolated	as	ever,”	Carter	said.	“They’d increased	the	guards	outside	Colony	House	and	strengthened	the	fortifications. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Machine	guns	covered	the	approaches	to	the	building	and	Terran	troops	could	he seen	mingling	with	the	militia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Behind	those	fortifications	it	seemed	they	continued	in	the	belief	that	they	were the	sole	authority	on	the	planet,	but	whatever	was	going	on	in	there	the	people regarded	as	irrelevant.	Preparations	were	still	being	made	for	the	election	of	a Colonial	Assembly,	in	secret	since	political	activity	was	now	illegal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Otherwise	life	went	on	as	normal.	People	went	to	work,	the	transport	systems were	running,	shops	and	cafes	still	did	trade.	Art	galleries,	cinemas,	theatres	still opened	their	doors	to	the	paying	public.	Politically	things	seemed	quiet.	Until	a few	days	later,	when	the	demonstrations	began.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“THOUSANDS	of	people	gathered	at	Trafalgar	Central	Station	for	the demonstration,”	Nidel	said.	“Some	of	the	Coalition	leaders	were	caught	in	a dawn	raid	and	arrested	the	week	before.	They	were	being	held	somewhere	in	the city,	but	the	police	hadn’t	disclosed	the	position.	The	other	Opposition	leaders still	at	liberty	organised	the	protest	to	demand	their	release. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“New	Station	Road	was	crowded	with	people.	Banners	and	placards	were stacked	everywhere,	waiting	to	be	handed	out.	The	air	was	filled	with	the	babble of	excited	voices,	discussing	politics,	the	wave	of	arrests,	and	the	prospects	for the	march. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maxwell	Steadman	had	been	arrested.	It	was	widely	rumoured	that	the	leaders of	the	Opposition	Coalition	had	tipped	him	as	the	first	President	of	a	free Greyermede.	He	was	one	of	the	founder	members	of	the	Independence	Party.	As one	of	Greyermede’s	few	industrialists	able	to	compete	with	Terran	capital,	his wealth	helped	get	the	party	off	the	ground.	Arresting	him	was	pure	provocation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Someone	started	handing	out	the	placards;	the	preparations	well	under	way.	It was	a	confusing	time.	People	were	wandering	back	and	forth,	giving	out	hurried instructions,	unfurling	banners	and	so	on.	People	were	shuffling	into	place, forming	ragged	lines	under	the	guidance	of	the	official	stewards,	marked	by yellow	vests	for	identification. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘What	do	you	reckon	the	cops’ll	do’?’	someone	asked	me	nervously. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>“‘I	don’t	know.	Don’t	worry,	we’ll	be	okay.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘But	I’ve	never	been	arrested	before.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘You	won’t	be	arrested,	trust	me!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“AFTER	about	fifteen	minutes	the	march	organisers	finally	had	everything ready.	We	slowly	headed	off	down	the	road,	gathering	speed	towards	the	city centre.	Waving	placards	branded	with	slogans	such	as	‘Prisoners	Out	Now’	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Dutton	Go	Home’,	we	walked	down	New	Station	Road.	Traffic	was	halted	and diverted	along	the	route	of	the	march	by	other	stewards	and	volunteers;	and people	stopped	to	watch	as	the	march	went	by.	There	were	about	five	thousand people	there	that	day.	It	was	quite	an	event. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	passed	into	the	business	district,	just	outside	the	city	centre.	For	some reason	the	march	came	to	a	halt,	but	we	still	stood	there	chanting	and	shouting.	I looked	around,	trying	to	see	through	the	ranks	of	people.	On	my	left,	I	saw	a	few riot	cops	standing	idly	by.	One	casually	tapped	his	baton	against	his	leg,	his helmet	visor	raised	to	reveal	an	impassive	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">”’	Oh	shit!’	someone	said	behind	me.	I	had	to	agree.	Things	didn’t	look	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handing	my	placard	to	someone	beside	me,	I	pushed	my	way	through	the	crowd in	an	attempt	to	get	nearer	the	front.	Suddenly	I	found	I	couldn’t	move	anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	crowd	had	compressed	together,	then	it	surged	backwards.	I	was	knocked	to the	ground	as	people	fled	screaming	and	dropping	placards	everywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	nearly	trampled	under	that	stampede,	but	someone	kept	their	head.	They hastily	dragged	me	to	my	feet	and	pulled	me	along	for	a	few	metres	before	we became	separated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	screaming	grew	louder	as	people	struggled	to	get	away.	Riot	police appeared	in	droves,	clubbing	the	people	to	the	ground	and	kicking	them	where they	lay.	A	riot	cop	barged	past	me	to	club	a	young	woman	to	the	ground.	She was	dragged	off	by	her	hair,	screaming	and	swearing	at	the	cop.	I	turned	around in	dismay	as	more	police	appeared,	and	just	missed	being	clubbed	to	the	ground myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	seemed	to	be	a	whole	army	of	them.	They	were	dressed	in	their	black riot-armour,	their	faces	hidden	by	long	tinted	visors.	They	didn’t	have	shields, only	batons	and	riot	guns.	I	ran	as	fast	as	I	could	as	more	vans	came	skidding	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>a	halt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	familiar	face	appeared	through	the	crowds	about	ten	metres	away.	I	ran towards	him	waving	madly.	Then	I	saw	him	go	down.	Holding	his	face	as though	he	had	been	clubbed.	Yet	there	had	been	nobody	near	him.	I	covered	the distance	in	seconds	and	kneeled	down	to	help	him.	The	man’s	face	was	dripping in	blood,	and	was	badly	bruised.	It	was	then	I	knew	the	bastards	were	using plastic	bullets.	Two	more	people	came	up	to	help,	and	we	half-carried,	half dragged	my	friend	away	to	safety.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">DEMONSTRATION	after	demonstration	fell	this	way.	Smashed	apart	by	well-organised,	well	equipped	armies	of	riot	police.	Thousands	were	arrested wherever	they	tried	to	organise.	The	city	streets	belonged	to	the	State. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whenever,	wherever,	the	Opposition	Coalition	attempted	to	demonstrate	they found	the	police	waiting	for	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	situation	seemed	in	hand.	The	middle	class	opposition	was	wavering	in	the face	of	this	strong	state	machinery.	Thousands	of	their	best	members	languished in	Dutton’s	prisons,	hundreds	of	thousands	more	were	becoming	too	frightened to	resist.	Days	passed,	and	Dutton	and	his	Government	began	to	breathe	more easily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Until	the	workers	came	out	on	strike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Trade	Union	Federation	had	completed	negotiations	with	the	faltering Opposition	Coalition.	A	wave	of	strikes	shook	the	planet,	like	nothing	seen	so far.	Factories	closed	down.	Communications	workers,	transport	and	many	others came	out	in	protest.	The	cities	were	crippled.	Nothing	functioned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Police	resources	became	stretched	to	breaking	point.	The	Government	managed to	keep	essential	functions	running	by	stationing	militia	and	police	personnel	in charge	of	their	operations.	In	so	doing,	Dutton	drastically	weakened	his	counter-insurgency	forces	out	in	the	field. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heartened	by	this	turn	of	events,	the	Opposition	Coalition	organised	more demonstrations	and	marches.	Even	more	boldly	they	organised	mass	pickets	and rallies	outside	Colony	House	itself.	There	were	still	clashes	with	the	security forces,	and	some	marches	were	dispersed,	but	the	police	had	lost	control.	Too much	unrest	had	broken	out.	The	People	controlled	the	streets. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>In	this	heated	situation,	the	demonstrators	came	to	clash	more	often	with	the militia.	This	was	a	more	serious	turn	of	events.	This	was	a	body	of	men	and women	armed	with	automatic	weapons	and	other	serious	military	hardware.	The middle	class	leaders	could	not	slow	events	down.	The	working	class	pushed them,	not	to	mention	their	own	rank	and	file.	But	they	needn’t	worry.	In	clash after	clash,	ordinary	people	disarmed	the	militia	threat;	arguing	with	them,	and appealing	to	them	not	to	fire	on	their	fellow	citizens.	In	case	after	case,	the militia	was	defused,	and	brought,	if	not	onto	the	side	of	the	people,	at	least	into neutrality;	to	the	outrage	of	its	Terran	officer	corps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Days	turned	into	weeks,	then	months.	Strikes,	demonstrations	and	clashes	with the	police	increased.	The	working	class	organisations	expanded	their	scope;	from strike	committees	grew	embryonic	workers’	councils,	which	soon	began	to	take control	of	factories	and	administer	their	operations.	Greyermede	was	gripped	in a	power	vacuum,	waiting	for	one	side	or	the	other	to	fill	the	void	of	authority. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	felt	Dutton	and	his	Terran	bosses	would	be	forced	to	yield	to	so	much popular	pressure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK	OCTOBER	AND	BEYOND</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	4</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	power	vacuum	continued	until	October.	In	terms	of	anti-Government action,	the	working	class	was	tied	to	the	Opposition	Coalition	by	the	trade unions.	Underneath	this	alliance,	however,	the	working	class	moved	steadily	in its	own	direction.	This	drift	towards	independent	action	worried	both	the Coalition	and	the	leadership	of	the	colony’s	trade	union	movement,	but	there was	little	they	could	do	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Greyermede	Communist	Party	(GCP)	was	increasing	its	support	within	the working	class	by	its	words	and	by	its	deeds.	They	fought	alongside	the	workers in	their	struggles	against	austerity	measures.	In	that	way,	the	party	gained	the kind	of	respect	that	the	mainstream	parties	only	dreamed	of. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	city	after	city,	factory	after	factory,	the	workers	voted	a	resounding	yes	to	the GCP,	and	millions	surged	to	join	the	party.	The	Opposition	leaders	were horrified,	but	they	hoped	the	workers	could	be	persuaded	to	see	sense	once	the planet	was	theirs.	For	the	moment,	they	needed	the	strength	of	the	workers	to carry	their	own	revolution	forward.	While	the	GCP	fast	became	a	sizeable majority	amongst	the	industrial	and	rural	workers,	the	Coalition	was	still confident	in	the	millions	of	office	workers	that	gave	support,	and	in	the	many professionals	and	businessmen	that	threw	their	weight	behind	the	Coalition.	The Trade	Union	Federation	also	retained	a	lot	of	influence	over	its	members.	It	was hoped	that	these	factors	would	be	enough	to	dampen	any	further	revolutionary fervour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	meantime,	the	Coalition	wasted	no	opportunity	to	denigrate	the	GCP	and the	other	working	class	revolutionary	parties.	The	honeymoon	period	was	fast breaking	down;	the	class	struggle	was	reaching	a	head,	before	even	the	Old Regime	had	toppled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	power	vacuum	continued	nonetheless.	The	Coalition	was	unprepared	to confront	the	Government	in	a	direct	bid	for	power.	It	preferred	to	bide	its	time until	the	election	of	the	Colonial	Assembly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	working	class	wasn’t	ready	to	seize	power.	Workers’	councils	had	arisen across	the	planet,	but	they	were	still	little	more	than	strike	committees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Relatively	few	had	taken	the	step	towards	running	their	own	enterprises.	Yet,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>workers	were	moving	forward	at	a	rapid	pace.	They	needed	to.	Under	such intense	strike	activity,	the	workers	had	to	take	things	under	their	own	guidance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Otherwise,	Dutton	would	have	starved	them	out.	The	webs	of	proletarian	power were	fast	being	spun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">MEANWHILE,	Dutton	released	a	great	deal	of	political	prisoners.	The	pressure of	popular	revolt	forced	his	hand.	In	order	to	appease	the	angry	populace	and buy	himself	some	time,	he	released	thousands	from	the	overcrowded	prisons.	To the	delight	of	the	Opposition	Coalition,	Maxwell	Steadman	also	gained	his freedom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	a	hero	of	the	Revolution.	His	face	appeared	on	the	front	pages	of	every opposition	paper	there	was.	Even	Dutton’s	media	carried	interviews	with	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	image	of	a	future	interplanetary	statesman	was	carefully	managed,	and Steadman’s	rise	to	Presidency	was	assured. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	5</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	police	learned	a	great	deal	of	information	from	the	unfortunates	that	fell into	the	hands	of	their	interrogators.	A	massive	sweep	was	planned	to	arrest those	whose	names	and	addresses	were	revealed	by	the	torture	victims.	These people	were	saved	by	Dutton’s	proclamation	that	released	the	prisoners	before the	police	could	act. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	being	thwarted	by	the	turn	of	events,	they	learned	valuable	intelligence from	their	captives,	and	from	CIS	agents	embedded	in	the	population	itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile	the	police	and	the	militia	still	clashed	with	strikers.	Time	after	time they	tried	to	break	the	strikes	by	physical	force.	Sometimes	they	succeeded, mostly	they	failed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Events	were	building	to	a	head.	The	power	vacuum	couldn’t	last	much	longer with	the	working	class	building	up	its	strength.	The	turning	point	of	the Revolution	was	coming,	and	I	had	only	just	stepped	off	the	shuttle	at	Copernicus Spaceport,	completely	unaware	of	what	was	unfolding	a	hundred	miles	away	in Trafalgar…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	small	group	of	us	gathered	in	Peterloo	Square	on	the	morning	of	the	9th,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nidel	said.	“There	wasn’t	a	soul	about,	which	was	good,	because	what	we	were doing	was	illegal.	I	was	part	of	a	group	of	volunteers	preparing	the	square	for	the rally	later	that	day.	It	was	planned	to	be	the	biggest	yet	-	about	half	a	million people	were	expected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	square	echoed	with	the	sound	of	our	hammers	as	we	prepared	the	platform from	where	the	speakers	would	address	the	crowd.	We’d	placed	it	in	front	of	the Opera	House	steps,	so	that	it	commanded	a	view	of	the	whole	square.	When	the platform	was	ready,	we	began	to	decorate	it	with	banners	and	flags.	The	new	flag of	Greyermede	had	just	been	hung	from	the	front	of	the	opera	house;	it	was	blue, emblazoned	with	the	continents	of	the	planet	in	mimicry	of	the	Terran	flag.	We finished	off	by	setting	up	the	PA	system.	That	was	something	I	didn’t	know	how to	do,	so	I	was	standing	by	with	a	couple	of	my	friends	from	university, supposedly	keeping	a	look	out.	Instead,	we	just	talked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Who’re	you	going	to	vote	for,’	I	was	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>“‘I	dunno,	Paul,	what	about	you?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘It	doesn’t	really	matter,	the	Reds	will	probably	get	the	majority!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘I	doubt	it,’	my	other	friend	said.	‘Anyway,	I’ve	heard	the	Coalition	isn’t	going to	let	extreme	parties	stand	candidates,	isn’t	that	right,	Rob?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘So	I’ve	heard,’	I	replied.	I	didn’t	really	know,	or	care	at	that	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘I’ll	bet	the	Reds	don’t	like	that!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘They	don’t,	but	who	cares?	They	don’t	represent	any	legal	voice	of	the workers	-	the	only	authoritative	voice	there	are	the	unions,	and	they’re	behind the	Coalition	one	hundred	per	cent!	Once	there’s	a	democratic	government,	then just	let	them	try	their	insurrectionary	antics!’	Michael	added.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	was	nothing	I	could	say	to	that.	I	just	nodded	my	head	and	wondered	if anything	could	ever	be	that	easy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	one	of	the	GCP	stewards	at	Central	Station,”	Carter	said,	taking	up	the tale.	“The	rail-workers	had	already	taken	control	of	the	network.	They	were running	the	trains	themselves.	Thousands	of	people	were	gathered	outside	the station.	Trainloads	more	were	being	shipped	in	from	as	far	away	as	three hundred	miles,	just	for	this	march.	With	so	many	people	gathering	in	one	place, you	can	imagine	the	confusion.	It	was	important	to	prevent	the	platforms	being clogged	up	with	people,	so	I	and	several	comrades	were	instructed	to	move	the new	arrivals	outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There,	the	crowds	were	getting	themselves	into	ragged	lines;	arranged according	to	party,	city,	or	regional	organisation.	The	ranks	stretched	on	for about	half	a	mile.	Yellow	vested	stewards	mingled;	sorting	out	the	lines,	giving hurried	instructions,	or	chatting	with	comrades	from	their	own	organisations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	of	the	stewards	were	shouting	instructions	to	the	assembled	ranks	through megaphones,	producing	a	weird	echo-like	effect,	as	the	instructions	were repeated	further	down	the	line.	The	combined	noise	of	thousands	of	chattering voices,	and	the	harsh,	amplified	speech	of	the	megaphones	was	almost deafening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	walked	back	into	the	station,	passing	groups	of	people	excitedly	discussing politics.	Beyond	them	were	some	members	of	the	Independence	Party;	middle</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>class	socialites	dressed	in	expensive	clothes,	we	greeted	each	other	with	sour looks.	They	didn’t	want	the	GCP	present,	but	we	had	turned	up	as	party	cadres, rather	than	union	branches,	and	they	weren’t	prepared	to	turn	us	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	went	to	my	assigned	post	on	Platform	Three.	‘The	Teliote	train’s	coming!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">someone	shouted.	I	looked	down	the	track,	I	could	just	see	the	train	beginning	to slow.	As	it	pulled	into	the	station,	the	driver	waved	a	greeting.	It	came	to	a	halt smoothly	and	a	horde	of	people	flooded	out:	workers,	students,	well-dressed professionals,	and	office	workers	in	their	typically	bland	uniform	of	grey	suit and	white	shirt.	From	some	of	the	carriages	people	were	hastily	passing	out bundles	of	placards	and	folded	up	banners.	Chaos	it	seemed,	but	within	that chaos	there	was	order	as	people	proceeded	to	carry	out	previously	allotted	tasks as	quickly	as	they	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Make	your	way	outside	please!’	I	shouted	above	the	noise	of	the	crowd.	People began	to	move	towards	the	exits.	There	was	none	of	the	grumbling	and	pushing you	would	have	got	before.	The	atmosphere	was	joyful	and	optimistic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everybody	was	excited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	job	in	the	station	was	finished,	so	I	followed	the	crowd	outside	and watched	the	confused	mingling	of	the	newcomers	as	they	assembled.	The important	Coalition	groups	were	at	the	front	-	those	of	the	‘respectable’	middle class	in	other	words.	The	union	branches	followed	behind	them.	Bringing	up	the rear	were	all	the	members	of	the	revolutionary	parties	that	were	taking	part.	The organisers	wanted	us	to	know	precisely	what	they	thought	of	us.	At	the	same time,	they	wanted	to	make	sure	that	onlookers	saw	their	organisations	in	the prominent	positions.	We	weren’t	bothered.	We	knew	we’d	out-shout	them anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	could	see	Maxwell	Steadman	loitering	around	the	entrance	to	the	station	with a	few	of	his	cronies;	Don	Bentham	of	the	Liberal	Party,	Stephen	Northcote deputy	of	the	Independence	Party	and	a	few	others	I	didn’t	recognise.	They	were going	to	lead	the	march,	these	heroes	of	the	Revolution,	while	the	‘proles’</p>
<p class="calibre1">brought	up	the	rear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“IT	took	about	fifteen	minutes	to	get	the	new	arrivals	into	place,	and	another fifteen	minutes	for	stewards	with	megaphones	to	run	down	the	final	outline	of the	day’s	events.	Then	the	march	slowly	got	underway. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>“The	marchers	walked	at	a	steady	pace	down	New	Station	Road.	Crowds	of shoppers	stopped	to	watch	as	we	went	past,	and	the	office	windows	were	filled with	cheering	people.	The	atmosphere	was	electric.	We	Chanted	and	shouted	and sing	songs	of	defiance;	the	confidence	of	those	there	that	day	was insurmountable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	we	turned	onto	High	Gate	Street	we	began	to	see	the	riot	cops.	Vans	were parked	here	and	there,	the	drivers	peering	out	with	undisguised	hatred.	The pavements	were	lined	with	cops	watching,	shouting	abuse,	but	otherwise	doing little.	There	were	hundreds	of	thousands	of	us.	Too	many	for	them.	We	weren’t afraid	and	we	made	sure	they	knew	by	singing	and	chanting	with	greater ferocity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	an	amazing	feeling	to	be	walking	amongst	those	same	cops	that	so viciously	smashed	previous	marches.	As	a	steward,	I	was	walking	on	the	edge, closest	to	the	cops.	I	could	feel	their	hot	gaze	on	my	back	as	I	walked	by.	Several times,	I	almost	started	laughing,	but	I	thought	better	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	march	was	headed	by	a	huge	banner	made	from	the	new	Greyermede	flag, it	billowed	in	the	breeze	like	a	sail	pulling	the	People	behind	it.	Emblazoned	on the	banner	in	gold	letters	on	a	red	background	was	the	slogan,	‘Smash	the	face	of Tyranny:	Independence,	Freedom,	Democracy,	NOW’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	the	march	began,	representatives	issued	an	historic	broadcast	to	the planet.	It	was	Greyermede’s	Declaration	of	Independence,	issued	from	a	hidden</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘pirate’	transmitter,	but	a	direct	call	for	Earth’s	puppet	regime	to	dissolve	itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Steadily	the	march	progressed	on	its	course	without	hindrance.	At	last,	we	were approaching	Peterloo	Square,	only	to	be	met	by	lines	of	armed	militia	troops. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	stared	at	us	nervously.	They	were	in	full	battle	gear	and	toyed	uncertainly with	automatic	weapons.	From	a	troop	carrier,	the	vehicle’s	commander	gazed	in wonder	at	the	sea	of	people	that	halted	before	the	militia	lines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	militia	Colonel	with	a	strong	Terran	accent	strode	from	behind	the	lines	and stopped	a	metre	from	the	first	rank	of	our	march.	Brent,	the	city’s	Chief	of	Police stood	by	his	side,	in	his	dress	uniform.	The	marchers	eyed	them	warily,	but	from the	mutterings	around	me,	I	knew	they	weren’t	going	to	back	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘This	is	an	illegal	march!’	the	Colonel	bellowed	in	his	best	parade-ground voice.	‘You	people	shall	disperse	by	order	of	the	civil	and	military	authorities. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>We	cannot	tolerate	anarchy	and	lawlessness	in	the	streets!	I	have	orders	to	use force	if	you	fail	to	comply.’	Only	angry	murmurs	answered	his	demand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘I’m	saddened	to	see	a	respectable	man	like	yourself	amongst	this	rabble,	Sir,’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Commissioner	Brent	said	to	Steadman.	He	merely	smiled,	and	then	turned	to face	the	crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘The	heel	of	Terran	tyranny	wants	us	to	disperse!’	he	cried.	‘What	say	you? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shall	we	disperse	like	frightened	rabbits,	or	shall	we	walk	on	into	the	future	of	a free	and	prosperous	Greyermede?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	crowd	gave	out	a	great	roar,	as	thousands	of	voices	answered	Steadman:</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘GO	ON!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Steadman	turned	to	face	the	militia,	‘You’ve	heard	our	answer.	In	the	pursuit	of the	higher	ideals	of	freedom	and	democracy,	we	are	prepared	to	die!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	Steadman	turned	his	attentions	to	the	lines	of	the	militia.	‘Fellow	citizens of	Greyermede!’	he	bellowed.	‘Why	do	you	follow	the	enemies	of	Freedom?	Put down	your	weapons,	you	have	no	reason	to	shoot	and	kill	your	brothers	and sisters.	Such	an	act	would	only	re-forge	the	chains	that	have	linked	us	to	the despot	of	the	colonised	galaxy!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“People	began	to	approach	the	troops	and	engage	them	in	argument.	The	militia looked	uncertain	as	their	officers	barked	orders	at	them	and	told	them	to	arrest the	people	that	entered	their	ranks,	but	they	ignored	them,	and	some	listened intently	to	the	arguments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Comrades!’	A	young	woman	cried,	climbing	onto	the	bonnet	of	the	police chief’s	car.	‘You	must	choose	whose	side	you	are	on.	Are	you	the	slaves	of Earth,	stained	with	the	blood	of	innocents	who	believe	only	in	democracy	and freedom?	Or	are	you	citizens	of	Greyermede,	armed	and	trained	to	defend	us, your	people,	from	aggression	and	tyranny?	If	you	are	slaves	then	you	must	fire on	us.	If	not	then	you	must	join	us.	Put	down	your	weapons.	Do	not	commit	the murder	of	so	many	unarmed	and	defenceless	people!	Support	us!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	officer	in	charge	didn’t	like	the	turn	of	events.	He	dragged	the	woman	from the	car	and	threw	her	to	the	ground.	‘Don’t	listen	to	these	agitators!	They	would turn	you	away	from	your	legal	government	and	lead	you	into	mutiny	if	you listened.	Earth	is	the	friend	of	Greyermede	and	always	has	been.	I	order	you	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>disperse	these	subversives	-‘</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	march	began	to	move	once	more,	closing	on	the	lines	of	the	militia.	As	we drew	closer,	Steadman	and	his	cronies	began	to	sing	the	Internationale	-	the ancient	song	of	the	revolutionary.	It	filled	my	heart	with	loathing	to	hear	the likes	of	Steadman	sing	that	song,	but	the	crowds	took	up	the	words,	and	thus singing	we	passed	through	the	militia:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Arise	ye	starvelings	from	your	slumbers</p>
<p class="calibre1">Arise	ye	prisoners	of	want</p>
<p class="calibre1">For	reason	in	revolt	now	thunders</p>
<p class="calibre1">And	at	last	ends	the	age	of	cant</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	away	with	all	your	superstitions</p>
<p class="calibre1">Servile	masses	arise!	arise! </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’ll	change	forthwith	the	old	conditions</p>
<p class="calibre1">And	spurn	the	dust	to	win	the	prize</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	comrades	come	rally</p>
<p class="calibre1">And	the	last	fight	let	us	face</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Internationale</p>
<p class="calibre1">Unites	the	human	race</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	harsh	voice	of	the	commander	was	drowned	out	in	the	tumultuous	voice	of the	masses.	The	militia	troops	looked	on,	a	few	raised	their	weapons	but	then	let them	fall	once	more.	They	lacked	the	heart	to	fire	on	their	own	people.	The whole	ethos	of	the	militia	was	based	on	defending	the	citizens	of	Greyermede, and	in	the	crunch,	they	could	not	open	fire.	The	forces	of	Dutton’s	state	machine looked	on,	either	helpless	or	in	silent	sympathy	as	we	marched	triumphantly through	them	to	swarm	into	Peterloo	Square.	“</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	6</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“BANNERS	and	flags	flapped	madly	in	the	wind	as	though	they	would	be	torn away	from	the	platform.	A	forest	of	placards	swung	in	the	air	above	the	heads	of half	a	million	people	as	the	Coalition	leaders	mounted	the	platform. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	combined	noise	of	thousands	of	people	shouting	and	chanting	was	ear shattering.	I	felt	sure	that	collective	voice	was	shaking	the	Colonial	regime	to	its very	foundations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	crowd	looked	on	expectantly	as	Don	Bentham	mounted	the	rostrum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Waving	his	arms	in	the	air	in	a	call	for	silence,	he	leaned	towards	the microphone	and	spoke	a	few	words,	which	were	lost	in	a	whine	of	feedback. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bentham	grimaced	and	stood	back	from	the	microphone	until	the	noise	subsided. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘I	want	to	thank	you	all	for	coming	today!’	he	said	at	last.	‘You	have	sent	a message	to	the	colonised	galaxy	saying	Greyermede	is	no	longer	an	enslaved world.	Today	we	have	taken	our	place	in	the	community	of	free	worlds!’	The crowd	greeted	the	statement	with	a	loud	burst	of	cheers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	the	cheering	subsided,	Bentham	spoke	again,	‘Behind	me	are	seated	the leaders	of	the	opposition	groups	that	have	fought	Terran	tyranny	and	brought	us to	the	brink	of	a	new	democratic	age.	They	will	be	talking	to	you	here	today,	on this	great	occasion;	the	birth	of	a	new	era.	As	of	today,	Dutton	is	merely	the leader	of	a	provisional	government.	Empowered	by	us,	the	representatives	of	the people,	to	administer	our	world	until	the	formation	of	a	new	government	after the	elections	in	November.’	He	paused	for	breath,	and	produced	a	slip	of	paper from	the	pocket	of	his	designer	suit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘This	fax	was	today	delivered	to	Governor	Dutton	informing	him	of	the situation.	It	does	not	list	demands,	it	lists	our	orders:	the	orders	of	a	People united	towards	the	goal	of	freedom!’	More	cheers	interrupted	Bentham.	‘But we’re	not	fools.	We	knew	Dutton	would	try	to	stop	us	in	our	march	to democracy.	On	our	way	here	you	saw	that,	and	this	very	day	we	showed	Dutton that	the	coercive	arms	of	Terran	tyranny	no	longer	work.	The	militia	is	with	us, in	spirit	if	not	in	body!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Dutton	has	been	shown	the	hopelessness	of	his	position,	he	has	no	choice	but</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>to	comply.	The	future	waits	with	baited	breath,	which	way	shall	you	vote?	The future	government	of	our	world	is	in	your	hands!’	Bentham	left	the	stand	to applause	and	many	cheers,	Steadman	approached	now,	smiling	benevolently	for the	benefit	of	the	media. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Citizens	of	free	Greyermede!’	he	began,	bellowing	in	his	loud,	deep	voice.	‘In a	month,	we	go	to	the	polling	booths,	for	the	first	time	in	the	hundred-year history	of	our	world.	It	is	a	great	day	for	Greyermede.	Indeed,	it	is	a	great	day for	this	galaxy,	when	an	oppressed	world	throws	off	its	shackles	and	reaches	out for	democracy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘As	to	your	voting	choice,	I	hope	you	will	vote	for	my	colleagues	and	I	in	the Independence	Party…	but	let	us	not	forget	the	other	parties	in	our	Coalition.	We are	all	committed	to	the	new	Greyermede.	Not	a	world	in	which	a	few	dictate	to the	many,	but	a	world	in	which	we	all	co-operate	to	build	a	better	world.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	great	cheer	cut	Steadman	off,	and	placards	waved	triumphantly	in	the	air.	At the	back	of	the	square,	someone	unfurled	a	huge	banner	proclaiming	‘Steadman for	President!’.	The	Coalition	had	turned	the	affair	into	a	pre-election	rally.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">NIDEL	continued:	“Of	course	it	was	being	used	for	electoral	reasons,	the election	was	only	a	month	away.	It’s	what	we’d	campaigned	for	all	that	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	so	many	people	had	suffered	and	fought	for	-	a	democratic	world.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	a	democracy	that	lives	by	selling	out	the	masses!”	Carter	interrupted bitterly.	“Democracy	on	the	terms	of	domestic	capitalism!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ignoring	the	interruption,	Nidel	went	on,	“The	atmosphere	was	ecstatic.	It	felt like	a	celebration.	At	the	front	of	the	rally,	people	began	to	chant.	‘Steadman	for President,’	they	cried	loudly,	repeatedly.	The	chant	caught	on	and	spread	like wildfire	through	the	crowd.	Steadman	just	stood	there,	arms	held	high,	beaming at	the	crowds,	lapping	up	the	attention.	This	was	his	hour,	his	popularity	was undeniable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	stood	there	chanting	and	shouting,	I	was	completely	caught	up	in	the	mood	of the	crowd.	Suddenly	I	noticed	that	the	people	on	the	platform	seemed	agitated, hurriedly	they	were	leaving	their	seats.	Someone	dragged	Steadman	away	from the	rostrum,	another	shouted	into	the	PA,	‘SOLDIERS!	The	soldiers	are coming!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>“Confusion	spread	through	the	crowds.	Hadn’t	the	militia	refused	to	act?	Then the	first	shots	sounded	above	the	noise	of	the	crowd.	Sharp	reports,	echoed rudely	through	the	square. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“People	around	me	began	to	panic.	Near	the	centre	we	couldn’t	see	a	thing,	but we	could	hear	the	gunshots	and	the	screams.	The	crowd	began	to	separate	as groups	of	panic-stricken	people	ran	this	way	and	that.	The	frightened	screams were	as	intense	as	the	exuberant	cheering	that	went	before.	A	stampede	began	as thousands	of	people	tried	to	flee	the	square	by	streets	that	were	now	so	many bottlenecks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	pushed	my	way	towards	the	platform.	It	seemed	a	good	place	to	get	my bearings.	The	platform	was	empty,	seats	scattered,	flags	and	banners	torn	and disarrayed.	I	caught	sight	of	Steadman	and	some	of	his	cronies	scurrying	into	the Opera	House,	escorted	by	two	armed	policemen.	I	thought	they’d	been	arrested but	I	later	found	the	police	escorted	him	to	safety. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	platform	commanded	a	good	view	of	the	square.	I	saw	our	assailants	for the	first	time.	They	weren’t	militia,	but	Terran	troops.	They’d	entered	the	square from	the	Bank	Street	access.	I	could	see	their	vehicles	parked	askew	on	the	road, troop	carriers	bearing	the	Terran	flag.	The	soldiers	themselves	swarmed	in squads	of	four	or	five	across	the	square.	Ahead	of	them,	the	square	was	littered with	bloodstained	bodies,	and	more	were	falling	before	that	indiscriminate	hail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	suddenly	realised	I	had	a	better	chance	of	survival	in	numbers.	Out	there	I	was increasingly	standing	out	as	a	target.	Fear	squeezing	my	heart,	I	raced	madly	for the	opera	house	doors,	hoping	to	follow	Steadman’s	route,	but	the	doors	were locked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Bastards!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	fresh	rattle	of	gunfire.	More	of	these	armour-clad	combat	troops	stormed	the square	from	the	South	side.	Suddenly	I	was	surrounded	by	kicking,	pushing	and screaming	people	as	they	fought	to	escape	these	fresh	killers.	A	man	stumbled	in front	of	me,	but	I	couldn’t	stop,	I	was	being	carried	by	the	flow.	He	was	trampled underfoot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	people	around	me	slowly	dispersed	as	they	fled	for	the	Oak	Tree	Lane	exit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	found	myself	in	the	open	once	more.	I	didn’t	like	that	feeling	of	exposure	and	I hastily	ran	towards	High	Gate	Road,	braving	the	gunfire,	since	it	was	the	least</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>crowded	exit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wasn’t	completely	alone	as	I	ran	the	gauntlet	of	gunmen.	A	group	of	about	ten or	twenty	people	followed	behind	me,	and	began	to	overtake.	I	saw	one	man’s chest	explode	and	something	wet	splashed	my	face.	He	went	down,	a	gaping hole	where	his	heart	should	have	been,	a	few	shattered	ribs	glistened	wetly.	I	ran all	the	harder,	keeping	low.	The	exit	was	up	ahead,	just	ten	metres	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	else	was	shot	behind	me.	The	victim	was	cannoned	into	me	by	the force	of	the	bullet’s	impact	and	I	fell	to	the	ground	under	the	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	near	hysteria	I	untangled	myself	from	the	corpse.	It	was	Paul,	one	of	my friends	who	helped	prepare	the	speaker’s	platform.	The	back	of	his	head	was gone.	I	didn’t	want	to	leave	him	there	like	that,	but	I	had	no	choice.	The	tears streamed	down	my	face	and	I	couldn’t	see,	but	I	cleared	the	final	ten	metres	and ran	down	High	Gate	Road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	free	of	that	killing	ground	at	last.	Free	that	is	until	several	armed	men stepped	into	view…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“THE	chatter	of	those	Terran	guns	cut	across	the	sounds	of	the	chanting,”	Carter said.	“I	was	near	the	edge	and	amongst	the	first	to	see	them.	We	ran	quickly,	or at	least	as	quickly	as	we	could	when	so	many	others	were	in	our	way.	We	left	a lot	of	good	comrades	behind	that	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Terran	troops	were	swarming	in	from	Bank	Street.	The	rest	of	the	crowd prevented	us	from	running	the	opposite	way.	In	terror	we	ran	towards	the	South side	of	the	square,	hoping	to	escape	down	that	road.	By	the	time	we	got	there, more	Terran	troops	arrived.	I	saw	at	least	ten	people	ahead	of	me	go	down,	cut	to pieces	by	the	Terran	bullets.	There	must	have	been	hundreds	of	others	who veered	away	from	the	troops.	Many	went	back	north	and	west,	but	I	found myself	in	a	group	that	was	trapped	against	the	entrance	to	a	high-class department	store.	It	had	a	columned,	neo-futurist	facade	that	offered	us	some cover	from	the	Terrans	as	they	stormed	by,	but	the	people	behind	us	were	less fortunate.	The	troops	cut	them	down	where	they	ran,	or	where	they	cowered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	girl	was	wailing	and	pulling	at	the	corpse	of	a	young	man,	maybe	the	girl’s boyfriend	or	brother.	A	gun	roared	and	small	explosions	of	blood	erupted	across her	back.	Crying	out,	she	arched	in	agony	before	slumping	across	her companion’s	corpse.	She	couldn’t	have	been	more	than	seventeen.	Another</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>group	of	people	was	cornered	by	the	troops.	They	fell	to	their	knees	and	pleaded for	their	lives,	but	the	soldiers	shot	them	one	by	one,	leaving	the	bodies	in	a pathetic	heap.	While	this	was	happening	more	people	fled	to	our	hiding	place, and	with	them	they	brought	the	killers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Three	soldiers	opened	fire	on	our	position.	The	bullets	bounced	dangerously	off the	concrete	facade.	A	man	next	to	me	crumpled	to	the	ground	with	a	gaping hole	in	his	forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	of	the	soldiers	turned	his	gun	on	a	crowd	of	fleeing	people	nearby.	The	gun chattered	eagerly,	dealing	out	death	until	the	magazine	clicked	empty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Desperately,	the	soldier	struggled	with	a	fresh	magazine,	but	before	he	could complete	the	reload,	the	fear	of	these	people	turned	to	hatred.	The	soldier	found himself	surrounded	by	angry	men	and	women	who	dragged	him	to	the	ground where	he	was	beaten.	His	gun	appeared	waving	in	the	air	a	moment,	then	it disappeared.	A	shot	sounded	a	moment	later	and	the	crowd	dispersed,	leaving the	soldier	sprawled	in	a	pool	of	blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Another	burst	cut	through	the	air	and	suddenly	we	found	ourselves	free	of	that hail	of	lead.	Cautiously	I	looked	out.	The	two	other	soldiers	were	slumped	on	the floor	in	twisted	heaps,	their	guns	discarded.	Fear	turned	to	anger	as	I	looked	out over	the	square.	It	was	littered	with	placards	and	the	bodies	of	the	dead	or	dying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Papers	blew,	scattering	in	the	breeze.	Soldiers	were	running	amok	among	the fleeing	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	ran	down	the	steps	and	picked	up	one	of	the	fallen	weapons.	A	woman	did	the same	-	one	of	many	anonymous	heroes	the	Revolution	produced.	Two	more soldiers	appeared	in	my	field	of	vision	so	I	opened	fire,	feeling	my	whole	body vibrate	as	the	gun	chattered.	They	fell	to	the	ground.	I	couldn’t	hear	the	sounds of	the	slaughter	anymore.	Only	this	terrible	roaring	sound	in	my	ears.	I	was angry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	fresh	burst	of	gunfire	tore	across	the	flagstones	ahead	of	us,	alerting	me	to more	Terran	troops.	A	squad	was	running	towards	us.	There	was	no	way	of escape	other	than	the	department	store	so	I	rushed	madly	back	up	the	steps.	A burst	shattered	the	glass	doors,	and	the	people	around	me	rushed	into	the	store. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	inside	the	woman	fired	at	the	troops,	while	the	rest	of	us	ran	through	the ground	floor,	stumbling	in	the	darkness	and	crashing	through	displays	of expensive	designer	clothes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>“The	soldiers	entered	the	building	cautiously.	On	seeing	us	they	opened	fire	and killed	at	least	three	people.	The	woman	fired	again	as	I	kicked	open	the emergency	doors	on	the	far	side	of	the	floor.	At	least	two	soldiers	fell,	the	others fled	the	building	as	we	filed	out	into	safety. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Once	outside	we	slumped	to	the	ground,	exhausted	and	suffering	from	shock, but	relieved	to	be	alive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	stopped	in	terror	as	armed	men	came	into	view.	They	regarded	me impassively	as	the	others	approached.	Seeing	the	armed	newcomers,	the	people behind	me	moaned,	and	several	fell	to	their	knees	to	plead	for	their	lives.	I	was exhausted,	my	breath	was	coming	in	gasps	and	my	heart	was	thumping.	I thought	I	was	going	to	die,	but	a	voice	cut	through	the	fatigue-haze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Quick,	get	inside	the	truck.	We’ll	hide	you!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	dawned	on	me	that	these	were	militia.	A	wave	of	relief	swept	through	me, and	we	hastily	clambered	into	their	truck.	I	stumbled	over	a	body	as	I	climbed in.	Shock	quickly	faded	to	surprise	as	I	saw	that	it	bore	the	marks	of	a	militia officer.	In	exhausted	fear,	we	sat	in	the	truck	and	tried	to	ignore	the	Terran’s accusing	stare.	A	few	people	were	crying	faintly,	and	being	comforted	by	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	outside	I	could	here	the	sounds	of	a	debate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Are	we	just	going	to	sit	here?’	a	voice	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘It’s	nothing	to	do	with	us.	We’re	militia,	not	politicians	or	revolutionaries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’ve	got	to	stay	neutral!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Neutral!’	another	voice	exclaimed.	‘We’ve	just	shot	the	Lieutenant	and	you want	neutrality?	We’re	in	it	up	to	our	necks	now!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Listen,	damn	you!	We’re	supposed	to	defend	our	people,	and	what	are	we doing?	Skulking	in	side	streets!’	The	first	voice	exclaimed.	An	uncomfortable silence	followed,	then	a	voice	demanded	a	vote	be	taken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“From	inside	the	truck	we	heard	the	sound	of	a	heavy	engine.	With	a	screech	of brakes	the	vehicle	stopped.	I	peered	through	the	canvas	cover	of	the	truck	to	see what	was	going	on.	Outside,	there	was	a	Terran	jeep	with	three	soldiers.	An officer	stood	beside	it	and	he	regarded	the	militia	coldly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>“‘What	are	you	men	doing	here?’	the	Terran	officer	growled.	The	militia	lounged against	the	truck,	eyeing	the	Terrans	morosely.	‘Where	is	your	officer,	Sergeant?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Sergeant	didn’t	reply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Must	I	repeat	myself,	man?’	the	Terran	asked	angrily.	‘Damned	ignorant colonials!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	officer	pulled	out	his	sidearm	and	pointed	the	muzzle	towards	the	Sergeant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I	order	you	to	engage	the	terrorists.	Failure	to	obey	an	officer	is	mutiny	-‘</p>
<p class="calibre1">A	gun	chattered	hungrily.	The	officer	fell	against	the	jeep	and	slumped	to	the ground.	The	other	Terrans	raised	their	weapons,	but	the	militia	sprayed	the	jeep and	its	occupants	in	a	deadly	hail	of	gunfire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	roar	of	their	automatic	weapons	ceased.	The	air	reeked	of	gunsmoke,	blood and	diesel	fumes.	In	silence,	the	militia	stared	at	the	dead,	realising	what	it meant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Look’s	like	a	unanimous	vote,’	the	Sergeant	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	7</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">OCTOBER	9th	was	the	blackest	day	of	the	Revolution.	It	became	known	as Black	October.	Nearly	three	thousand	people	were	killed	by	Terran	troops. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thousands	more	were	injured.	Similar	attacks	took	place	all	over	Greyermede. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Government	was	determined	to	restore	order,	by	any	means	necessary,	but this	massacre	was	by	far	the	worst. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Troops	ransacked	the	square	and	the	surrounding	streets	for	several	hours,	but they	didn’t	get	everything	their	own	way.	People	resisted,	fought	back,	dared	to take	on	the	Terrans.	It	was	unthinkable,	unheard	of,	but	they	did	it	all	the	same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	they	were	unable	to	seize	automatic	weapons	from	soldiers	who	fell	to	a	mob, then	they	hurled	stones	or	petrol	bombs.	Those	that	escaped	the	killing	ground, were	then	faced	by	the	vicious	onslaught	of	the	riot	police.	Attacked	with	shield, club,	riot	gun,	electro-prod,	and	gas.	Thousands	were	arrested,	but	many thousands	also	escaped.	Thanks	to	the	militia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several	units	engaged	the	Terrans.	Having	shot	their	officers	in	the	face	of	the massacre,	they	had	committed	mutiny,	but	they	found	themselves	unable	to	stand aside	while	people	were	slaughtered.	Many	of	these	militiamen	and	women	fell defending	Peterloo	Square,	but	they	killed	many	Terran	troops	and	allowed thousands	of	people	to	escape	who	otherwise	would	have	been	brutally murdered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	the	militia’s	intervention,	the	day	still	belonged	to	the	Terrans.	The massacre,	Dutton	believed,	finally	rid	the	Government	of	the	threat.	Steadman lost	his	popularity,	once	it	became	common	knowledge	that	the	police	escorted him	to	safety.	The	Opposition	Coalition	was	in	disarray.	The	planet	was	in shock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	day	after	the	massacre	Dutton	followed	up	this	operation	with	mass	arrests. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Offices	were	again	closed.	Papers	suppressed.	Over	the	next	few	days,	trials	took place	of	lesser	Opposition	leaders	and	those	involved	in	the	rally.	Then,	many these	victims	of	Terran	justice	were	executed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	horror	that	followed	Black	October,	nobody	asked	where	the	Terran	troops came	from.	The	workers	had	taken	control	of	the	rail	networks.	The	arterial roads	entering	the	city	had	been	watched	on	the	day	of	the	march.	It	was	later</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>discovered	that	the	troops	were	airlifted	in	several	days	before.	For	that	time, they	kept	themselves	hidden	in	empty	warehouses	by	the	airport.	From	there, they	drove	towards	Peterloo	Square.	Dutton’s	death	squads	were	already	in	the city	when	the	march	took	place.	It	was	clear	that	this	was	a	carefully	planned operation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“AS	the	days	passed	it	became	obvious	that	the	Opposition	Coalition	was broken,”	Carter	said.	“The	mass	arrests	broke	their	organisations,	and	their papers	were	shut	down,	as	it	turned	out	permanently.	They	had	been	so	confident</p>
<p class="calibre1">-	over-confident	in	fact.	The	Coalition	groups	operated	openly,	once	the	people took	control	of	the	streets.	Because	of	that,	the	Government	knew	all	about	them and	where	to	find	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Many	of	their	best	people	were	killed	or	arrested.	Many	others	were	too frightened	to	take	on	the	Government	anymore.	Yet	Dutton	wasn’t	in	the	clear yet.	The	middle	class	parties	were	smashed,	the	workers’	organisations	were hurt,	but	we	still	hadn’t	given	up	the	fight!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	took	several	days	to	regroup,	but	again	we	came	out	on	strike.	We concentrated	on	those	areas	important	to	administering	the	planet.	We	took	the rail	networks,	communication	links,	ports	and	so	on.	The	planet	was	crippled again,	as	the	working	class	wiped	the	smug	grin	off	Dutton’s	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	want	to	know	another	thing?”	Carter	asked.	“The	office	workers	began to	flock	to	the	working	class	parties.	With	their	assistance,	we	squeezed	our enemies	hard.	Government	departments	were	closed,	the	offices	of	big	business came	to	a	halt.	Only	the	security	forces	were	able	to	operate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">NIDEL	sat	silently	as	he	listened	to	Carter.	For	him	the	Revolution	ended	at	this point.	Dutton	did	what	the	workers	thought	they	would	need	to	do.	The	Terran troops	swept	aside	the	middle	class	opposition,	leaving	the	field	clear	for	a	clash between	Terran	capitalism	and	the	Greyermede	proletariat.	The	middle	ground withered	and	perished	in	the	heat	of	class	struggle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“OUR	own	organisations	remained	underground,	except	to	operate	in	the factories	and	workplaces,”	Carter	said.	“Here	the	security	forces	found	it	damn hard	to	suppress	us,	unless	they	first	smashed	the	workers	who	gathered	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Opposition	Coalition	possessed	few	such	points	of	union.	They	sought	the alliance	of	all	social	groups,	and	so	operated	outside	in	the	cities	-	a	very</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>vulnerable	place	to	be	as	they	found	out	to	their	cost.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">STILL	in	hiding,	Karl	Minsky	made	his	first	open	broadcast	to	the	planet.	From one	of	a	growing	number	of	‘pirate’	television	stations	controlled	by	ordinary people,	he	publicly	laughed	in	the	face	of	the	Government.	‘Comrades!	People of	Greyermede!’	he	greeted	the	colony.	‘The	bloody	fist	of	counter-revolution has	struck	the	face	of	our	struggle	for	liberation.	Dutton	and	Earth	have	revealed their	true	colours	to	us.	There	can	be	no	compromise	with	such	a	bloodthirsty opponent.	Either	capitalist	tyranny	crushes	us,	in	which	case	the	bloodshed	of the	9th	will	seem	insignificant	by	contrast,	or	we	take	the	power	for	ourselves, and	end	the	poverty,	the	repression	and	the	violence	of	capitalism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘This	is	no	idle	dream,	as	our	opponents	call	it.	Daily	the	workers	have	proved their	readiness	for	such	a	step.	Many	factories	and	offices	are	now	in	the	hands of	the	workers.	It	is	only	a	matter	of	these	elected	councils	broadening	their scope	to	take	on	the	civil	functions	of	the	discredited	Colonial	regime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘A	spark,	that	is	what	our	movement	represents.	A	spark	that	will	ignite	a revolutionary	fire	throughout	the	colonised	galaxy.	Today	capitalism	trembles.	It sees	with	horrible	clarity	that	its	days	are	numbered.	The	workers	are	coming, and	we	shall	build	socialism	on	the	bones	of	the	giant	corporations.	Greyermede has	shown	the	way	forward.	The	proletariat	of	other	worlds	will	surely	follow.’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Minsky	issued	an	ultimatum	calling	for	the	Government	to	step	down,	an ultimatum	the	workers	knew	would	not	be	realised	without	a	struggle.	Of peaceful	roads	to	their	goal,	they	knew	of	none.	Any	such	road	would	have ended	in	a	one-sided	slaughter	as	the	middle	class	opposition	groups	discovered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Government	needed	to	be	deposed	by	force,	they	wouldn’t	go	without	a fight.	Yet,	the	workers	were	largely	unarmed,	while	their	enemies	were	bolstered by	heavily	armed	Terran	troops.	Uncertainty	was	rife.	Could	the	workers,	with all	their	growing	organisation	and	their	bravery,	defeat	the	most	skilled	military force	in	the	galaxy? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	question	rested	on	the	militia.	What	would	they	do?	What	were	they thinking?	Then	thousands	of	faxes	and	e-mails	began	to	be	received	in	offices and	workplaces	all	over	the	city:</p>
<p class="calibre1">TO	THE	REVOLUTIONARY	WORKERS	OF	TRAFALGAR. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>Comrades!	The	criminal	acts	of	the	Colonial	Government	have	shown	it	to	be the	enemy	of	the	people.	After	great	debate,	the	militia	of	the	Holton	Garrison has	arrested	its	officer	corps	and	elected	its	own	Militia	Revolutionary Committee.	We	offer	our	protection	to	the	workers	of	the	city	against	counter-revolution,	and	we	call	upon	the	working	class	to	take	the	political	as	well	as	the economic	power. </p>

<p class="calibre1">THE	STORM	BREAKS</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	8</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">OCTOBER	was	passing	into	November	and	Greyermede	was	gripped	in	civil war.	All	over	the	planet	the	people	were	arming;	assisted	by	militia	regiments that	defected	to	the	Revolution.	The	cities	became	battlegrounds	as	the	security forces	of	the	old	order	fell	under	siege. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	only	was	the	colony	gripped	by	the	bloody	ferment	of	civil	war,	but	also remnants	of	the	old	Opposition	Coalition,	resurrected	in	the	guise	of	shadowy terrorist	organisations.	Gone	were	the	old	‘respectable’	party	leaders	and	would-be	professional	politicians.	These	new	organisations	were	filled	with	the bloodthirsty	zeal	of	younger,	extreme	activists.	Many	students,	their	heads	filled with	romantic	nonsense	about	the	heroism	of	a	liberation	struggle,	and	guided	by the	more	militant	section	of	the	intelligentsia,	besieged	the	Government	with assassinations	and	bombings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	most	prominent	of	these	terrorist	groups	named	itself	‘Black	October’.	It swore	vengeance	on	those	that	‘killed’	Greyermede’s	glorious	revolution,	and handed	the	world	to	the	Communists.	The	Government	found	itself	in	an impossible	situation,	but	still	it	clung	to	its	power,	such	as	it	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	ever,	the	heart	of	the	Revolution	was	to	be	found	in	Trafalgar	and	I	still hadn’t	been	able	to	leave	Firsthaven.	This	was	the	only	city	that	was	fully	in Government	control.	As	a	city	under	siege,	it	was	difficult	to	get	into.	It	was	also damn	difficult	to	leave.	The	authorities	didn’t	seem	to	want	to	lose	our	presence, thus	we	journalists	were	trapped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">News	did	filter	through	to	us	from	outside.	The	reports	told	of	street	battles between	armed	workers	and	the	Terran	military.	The	workers	stormed government	and	police	buildings.	Thousands	of	the	old	regime’s	functionaries were	arrested	and	languished	in	gaols	that	previously	incarcerated revolutionaries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	so	frustrating	being	stuck	inside	Firsthaven.	I	wanted	out	badly,	but	I	had to	bide	my	time	along	with	the	rest	of	the	journalists.	We	made	ourselves	busy by	filing	humdrum	reports	of	events	in	the	city,	or	the	hearsay	from	the	rest	of the	colony.	We	even	interviewed	Government	officials	when	they	deigned	to make	themselves	available. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>The	official	reason	for	our	forced	internal	exile	was	protection.	Outside	the	city, the	Government’s	spin	doctors	said,	the	Government	couldn’t	guarantee	us	any degree	of	personal	safety.	So	we	should	be	grateful	and	make	full	use	of	the doctored	reports	issued	to	us	by	the	Press	Office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	thing	the	Government’s	propaganda	cronies	couldn’t	cover	up	was	the	aura of	the	city.	It	felt	under	siege.	One	could	feel	the	tension	of	a	Government	whose forces	and	authority	were	daily	under	squeeze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	face	of	the	armed	people,	the	Government	was	sinking	deeper	into	the quagmire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">ALAN	Cohen	was	a	Sergeant	in	the	militia,	one	of	those	elected	by	his	comrades to	sit	on	the	Holton	Garrison’s	Militia	Revolutionary	Committee.	Life	in	the militia	was	tough,	but	he	never	thought	it	would	get	tougher	-	until	he	was elected.	There	was	a	lot	for	him	to	do,	it	was	hard	work,	stressful,	but	it	was	for	a worthwhile	cause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	barracks	had	such	an	intense	electric	aura.	The	officers	were	gone.	The rank	and	file	didn’t	have	to	obey	arrogant	fools,	but	took	orders	from	their	own elected	representatives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	was	a	lot	to	organise	now	we	commanded	ourselves.	Some	of	my comrades	on	the	committee	were	in	negotiation	with	the	GCP	leaders	about	the defence	of	the	city.	I	was	involved	with	organising	the	barracks.	Faxes	and	other communiqu�s	were	arriving	from	all	over	the	region,	telling	us	about	the massing	of	counter-revolutionary	forces.	Not	that	we	needed	telling	about	the dangers	they	posed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Soon	after	we	elected	our	committee,	there	was	a	brief	fight	with	the	Terran troops	responsible	for	Black	October.	They	were	stationed	at	our	garrison,	while they	awaited	reassignment.	Once	the	Terrans	found	out	what	was	happening	they tried	to	put	a	stop	to	it.	Arguments,	and	attempts	to	give	us	orders,	descended into	gunplay.	Several	people	were	killed	on	both	sides.	The	Terrans	were outnumbered,	and	outgunned	on	this	occasion;	they	took	to	their	vehicles	and stormed	out	of	the	compound,	guns	blazing.	That	victory	heartened	my comrades,	I	can	tell	you,	but	there	was	remorse,	too,	over	our	dead	friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	big	issue	in	those	days	was	arming	the	workers	of	the	city.	Some	were worried	about	the	disorder	and	the	violence	that	may	occur	if	weapons	were</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>handed	out	to	just	anybody.	Despite	this	debate,	it	needed	sorting	quickly.	Only if	the	people	were	armed	could	the	threat	of	counter-revolution	be	tackled,	but those	in	charge	of	the	armoury	refused	to	budge,	despite	the	heated	debates	and the	appeals	of	the	workers’	representatives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	the	end	it	took	the	intervention	of	Howard	Kramer6	to	sort	the	issue	out.	In	a heated	mass	meeting	he	argued	bluntly	for	the	arming	of	the	workers.	Militiamen and	women	were	packed	into	the	mess	hall	to	hear	the	debate.	I	was	seated	at	the head	of	the	hall,	with	the	rest	of	the	Militia	Revolutionary	Committee.	The	hall was	thick	with	the	stench	of	cigarette	smoke,	and	filled	with	the	excited	babble of	many	voices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Comrades!’	Private	Hussain,	the	Chairman,	cried	to	the	assembled	ranks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘We’ve	gathered	here	to	discuss	a	crucial	question	for	the	Revolution.	As	you know	the	forces	of	counter-revolution	are	gathering,	yet	there	are	those	who oppose	the	arming	of	the	workers.	The	situation	is	becoming	dire.	So	Howard has	asked	to	speak	to	you.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hussain	opened	the	floor	to	the	ranks.	The	Armoury	Sergeant	leapt	to	his	feet	to address	the	meeting.	‘We	didn’t	elect	our	own	leaders	to	appoint	an	irresponsible power!’	he	cried.	“Arm	the	workers	and	we	arm	the	forces	of	anarchy.	I	was against	joining	the	side	of	the	GCP,	I	was	for	neutrality	until	the	establishment	of a	constitutional	authority,	as	you	all	know.’	Jeers	and	insults	met	his	words,	but the	Sergeant	was	unperturbed	by	his	reception. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘You	have	voted	to	join	forces	with	the	workers,	and	I	respect	that	decision	as	a believer	in	democracy.	However	I	cannot	allow	the	workers	to	be	armed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Already	the	streets	are	filled	with	lawlessness,	how	much	worse	would	that become	if	the	streets	were	flooded	with	guns?	We	are	the	militia.	It	is	our	duty	to defend	the	people,	and	so	we	must	be	the	defenders	of	the	Revolution!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Sergeant	sat	down,	in	a	huff.	Another	soldier	sprang	up.	‘Comrades!’	he began.	‘I	am	a	member	of	the	GCP,	and	a	worker	at	heart,	although	I	was	forced to	wear	this	uniform.	I	say	the	workers	must	be	armed.	They	are	the	builders	of this	Revolution,	and	they	must	defend	it.	We	have	weapons,	and	we	cannot	hold onto	them!	If	we	do,	we	set	ourselves	up	as	a	separate	power	above	the	heads	of the	people.’	The	soldier	sat	down	to	cheers,	and	a	few	insults.	More	uniformed men	and	women	stood	up,	arguing	for	the	arming	of	the	workers,	or	against.	At last	Hussain	stood	up	once	more	to	address	the	ranks. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>“‘Comrade	Kramer	has	come	here	to	discuss	just	these	points,’	he	said	evenly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘The	vote	to	support	the	Revolution	means	we	must	co-operate	with	the revolutionary	workers.	If	they	require	arms,	we	should	provide	them.	We	are	no longer	a	force	separate	from	the	revolutionary	masses.	That	is	the	view	of	the Committee.	But	it	is	for	you	to	decide.	Are	there	any	objections	to	Kramer speaking?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	few	of	the	militia	raised	their	voices	in	objection.	Those	who	opposed	the arming	of	the	workers	and	many	that	wanted	the	militia	to	remain	neutral.	But the	combined	voice	of	the	rest	drowned	them	out	until	they	fell	into	silence.	The meeting	would	hear	what	Kramer	had	to	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kramer	approached	the	stand,	walking	calmly	down	the	central	aisle	of	the mess	hall.	Looking	tired	he	approached	the	podium	and	gazed	down	at	the packed	hall,	studying	the	hundreds	of	faces	wreathed	in	the	clouds	of	cigarette smoke.	Kramer	was	something	different	to	what	these	militia	troops	had	seen	or heard	before.	They	expected	a	media-compatible	personality	like	the	middle class	leaders.	Instead	they	got	a	tired,	unshaven	worker	wearing	jeans,	a	grubby shirt	and	a	battered	jacket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Comrades!’	his	nervous	voice	began.	‘I	represent	the	revolutionary	workers	of Trafalgar.	I	need	not	tell	you	that	the	forces	of	counter-revolution	are	gathering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	beat	them	the	workers	must	be	armed,	as	you’ve	heard	so	often	now.	I	hear words	of	caution	here	tonight,	that	the	workers	are	no	more	than	a	mob.	Well that	mob	has	pulled	down	the	mighty	towers	of	capitalism,	and	today	runs	things for	its	own	needs.	Would	you	set	yourselves	above	that? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Would	you	turn	your	backs	on	your	revolutionary	comrades?	Once,	many	of you	were	workers,	before	you	were	forced	into	those	uniforms.	Today	you	are workers	again.	When	you	voted	to	join	the	Revolution,	you	ceased	to	be	militia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	you	are	revolutionaries.	And	your	fellow	revolutionaries	need	your assistance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘I	understand	your	fears	about	lawlessness	and	anarchy	on	the	streets.	Since	the state	power	began	to	crumble,	anti-social	elements	have	descended	to	make	the most	of	their	opportunities.	But	look	to	the	factories	and	the	workplaces,	where revolutionary	order	is	in	place.	The	workers	have	displayed	only	the	best	of revolutionary	discipline. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a>“‘Let	me	tell	you	that,	even	as	I	speak,	delegates	of	all	the	revolutionary	parties are	meeting	to	discuss	the	election	of	a	city	council	to	be	composed	of representatives	from	all	the	workplaces	and	communities.	The	militia	is	also invited	to	join	this	city’s	new	governing	body.	It	will	restore	order	to	Trafalgar and	in	co-operation	with	your	own	committee	will	wage	the	fight	against counter-revolution.	Only	by	disciplined	action	will	we	beat	our	enemies,	but	we won’t	do	it	without	arms.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	appeal	finished,	Kramer	slowly	stepped	down	and	walked	back	down	the aisle.	Pausing	briefly	to	light	a	cigarette,	he	left	the	mess	hall	in	a	tumultuous uproar.	He	had	said	his	piece,	now	the	militia	would	decide	one	way	or	the	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Vote!’	people	shouted.	Others	said	the	issue	had	not	been	discussed sufficiently.	Everybody	present	was	clamouring	to	be	heard,	or	talking	it	over amongst	friends	and	associates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Haven’t	we	argued	enough?’	a	militia-woman	shouted	above	the	racket.	‘It’s time	to	vote!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Private	Hussain	stood	up	and	called	for	the	meeting	to	be	silent.	‘I	think	the general	feeling	is	for	the	vote,’	he	said.	‘Those	in	favour	of	opening	the armoury?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	mighty	roar	met	the	question,	beyond	a	doubt	the	majority.	The	‘nay-sayers’</p>
<p class="calibre1">simply	scowled	at	the	rest	as	they	sat	in	their	little	groups,	like	conspirators plotting	some	dark	deed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘I	think	that’s	the	issue	decided.	The	keys,	Sergeant?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Armoury	Sergeant	looked	as	though	he	was	about	to	argue,	but	then	he unclipped	his	keycard	and	handed	it	to	the	chairman.	‘On	your	head	be	it!’” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	9</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">ON	a	hot	and	bright	October	morning,	I	stood	in	my	hotel	room,	overlooking	the financial	sector	of	the	city.	Firsthaven	was	quiet	as	it	always	was	at	that	time during	the	civil	war.	The	streets	were	empty,	though	later	they	would	fill	with people.	The	city	may	have	been	under	virtual	siege,	but	life	still	went	on	as normally	as	possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Occasionally	a	truck	roared	past,	loaded	with	Terran	troops	fully	equipped	for war.	Officers	in	blue	berets	stared	sullenly	from	windows	that	had	been	opened to	let	in	the	breeze.	Police	helicopters	patrolled	the	skies,	sometimes accompanied	by	military	gunships. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	another	typical,	boring	day.	The	planet	had	erupted	in	flames.	Stories	were occurring	all	around	me,	but	I	was	trapped	in	the	city	by	the	authorities.	I	wanted to	taste	the	Revolution	for	myself,	rather	than	languish	in	my	hotel	room,	which was	fast	becoming	a	prison. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	flatscreen	was	blared	aloud,	but	I	ignored	it	and	continued	staring	out	of	the window.	The	glass	towers	of	colonial	capitalism	glistened	in	the	sun.	Two	blocks away,	I	could	see	the	stock	exchange	building,	empty	ever	since	the	markets	fell, and	no	chance	of	them	improving	while	the	Revolution	raged.	If	it	was victorious	then	there	would	never	again	be	a	stock	market	for	greedy	speculators to	make	a	packet	through	that	form	of	high-class	gambling;	where	the	chips	were company	shares	and	the	lives	of	millions	of	innocent	people	were	gambled	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	attention	was	suddenly	pulled	to	the	flatscreen	by	the	flat,	nasal	tones	of Governor	Dutton.	The	colony’s	unelected	leader	was	standing	at	a	podium behind	a	number	of	microphones	displaying	labels	such	as	NBS7,	MNN8,	RNS9</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	so	on.	Behind	him	there	was	a	huge	Terran	flag,	with	the	Greyermede colonial	emblem	hanging	from	a	stand	on	either	side.	Dutton	himself	was dressed	in	his	usual	expensive	suit,	with	a	rather	loud	tie	adorning	his	crisp, white	shirt.	He	looked	tired,	and	there	was	a	shadow	of	stubble	on	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir!”	one	of	the	journalists	cried	out.	“Penny	Marshall,	Martian	News	Network. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	are	you	responding	to	the	threat	from	the	terrorists?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dutton	turned	to	face	the	woman,	and	smiled	briefly.	“Everything	is	in	hand, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>Penny,”	he	replied.	“You	can	rest	assured	that	the	militia,	with	the	assistance	of our	friends	from	Home,	are	doing	their	best	to	bring	order	back	to	the	colony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Government	is	sure	that	the	situation	will	be	dealt	with	soon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	isn’t	it	true	that	much	of	the	militia	has	defected?”	a	fat,	perspiring journalist	asked	in	a	strong	Terran	accent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dutton	looked	sharply	at	the	man,	and	hesitated	before	replying.	“There	has	been mutiny	and	desertion	in	the	militia,	yes.	But	most	regiments	have	remained loyal.	Let	me	assure	you:	the	Communists	will	not	be	taking	this	world	from	its hard-working	citizens!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	camera	zoomed	in	on	Dutton’s	sincere,	but	hurt	looking	face.	“But	to	those who	have	deserted	I	will	say	this,	you	have	been	duped	by	demagogues	and trouble-makers	hell	bent	on	disrupting	our	once	ordered	world.	Return	to	your barracks.	Release	your	officers	and	hand	over	the	ringleaders	and	no	more	will be	said	of	this	affair.	You	have	my	personal	word	of	honour.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	camera	zoomed	out	and	panned	to	focus	on	another	of	the	journalists gathered	in	the	conference	room.	“Ben	Saunders,	Reuters	News	Service.	A	lot	of people	in	the	rest	of	the	galaxy	are	worried	about	the	situation.	It’s	had	quite	an effect	on	the	stock	markets,	will	the	situation	be	resolved	soon?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	I	can	tell	you	is	that	we	are	working	hard	to	resolve	this	crisis.	Nobody	likes bloodshed	and	violence,	but	we	didn’t	start	this	war.	We	will	certainly	finish	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	because	a	few	thugs	and	trouble-makers	want	to	run	riot	isn’t	going	to	put	a stop	to	efficient	government,	or	prevent	hard-working	businessmen	from creating	the	wealth	that’s	made	this	colony	so	prosperous	-” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	switched	off	the	television	in	disgust.	That	display	wasn’t	news,	it	was propaganda	pure	and	simple.	Though	isn’t	that	the	role	of	the	media?	That millions	of	toiling	fingers	were	reaching	out	for	freedom	and	democracy	didn’t warrant	a	column	inch.	A	few	greedy	plutocrats	were	losing	a	fortune	on	the stock	markets	and	pandemonium	broke	loose,	decrying	anarchy,	lawlessness	and theft. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’D	had	enough	of	being	cooped	up	in	my	hotel.	I	got	my	jacket	and	left	the room.	On	the	way	through	the	lobby,	I	caught	sight	of	some	of	the	other	hacks lounging	about	in	the	bar.	They	were	watching	Dutton’s	press	conference	on	a flatscreen	dominating	one	whole	side	of	a	wall.	Cynical	comments	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>observations	met	some	of	Dutton’s	comments.	I	ignored	them	and	walked	out into	the	bright	sunlight,	pausing	briefly	to	put	on	some	shades.	After	a	lifetime under	the	Martian	sky,	it	takes	some	time	to	get	used	to	bright,	blue	skies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	a	lonely	walk	through	the	city	streets.	Not	many	people	were	about,	but some	of	the	shops	had	opened	their	doors	in	the	forlorn	hope	of	doing	some trade.	Firsthaven	was	an	eerie	place.	It	seemed	desolate	and	deserted.	Workers here	were	also	on	strike	and	no	amount	of	threats	managed	to	get	them	back	to work.	Those	helicopters	that	patrolled	the	skies	and	the	troop	carriers	raging through	the	streets	were	a	stark	reminder	to	the	good	citizens	of	Trafalgar	-	the enemy	was	within	as	well	as	without	and	they	worked	in	the	factories	and	the shops	and	the	offices	of	this	very	city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stopped	briefly	by	the	Law	Courts	to	enjoy	the	shade	beneath	the	trees	that decorated	the	forecourt.	The	building	was	fortified.	Behind	coils	of	razor	wire and	sandbagged	machine	gun	emplacements,	bleary-eyed	troops	watched	the street.	Lawyers	and	the	occasional	judge	strolled	in	and	out	of	the	building.	The presence	of	the	troops	seemed	to	trouble	them	little,	although	even	they	needed	a pass	to	enter	the	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	sentries	began	to	regard	me	curiously.	I	took	that	as	my	cue	to	leave and	I	hurried	down	the	street.	A	police	helicopter	flew	overhead,	its	rotors making	that	distinctive	chopping	noise	as	they	sliced	through	the	air.	The helicopter’s	distorted	reflection	moved	over	the	surface	of	the	glittering	glass fingers	as	it	flew	low	over	its	patrol	route,	occasionally	lost	as	a	window	caught the	direct	reflection	of	the	sun’s	glare.	A	truck	roared	around	the	corner,	its	radio blaring	loudly	as	it	transported	its	cargo	of	militia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	all	beginning	to	make	me	feel	like	a	fugitive.	I	longed	to	see	just	one	other person	out	on	the	streets,	other	than	the	authorities.	Through	these	empty	streets, I	continued	to	walk	until	I	came	across	a	police	patrol	car	parked	on	a	quiet corner.	The	car	seemed	innocent	enough,	or	so	it	would	in	normal	times.	Now	it looked	sinister,	and	the	feelings	of	random	guilt	began	to	pound	in	my	chest.	I didn’t	know	where	to	look	for	fear	of	attracting	unwanted	attention.	So,	I	chose to	look	straight	ahead.	Difficult	under	the	gaze	of	the	shadows	occupying	the	car</p>
<p class="calibre1">-	until	I	got	close	enough	to	see	the	bullet	holes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	radio	squawked	loudly	with	some	police	controller	trying	to	raise	the occupants.	They	ignored	it	as	only	dead	men	can.	Flies	buzzed	around	the	car	as</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>the	two	occupants	sat	and	stared	ahead.	Their	uniforms	were	drenched	in	blood, already	congealing	around	ugly	holes	in	their	chests. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	footsteps	crunched	loudly	as	I	ground	the	fragments	of	the	shattered windscreen	underfoot.	A	metallic	noise	caused	me	to	look	down,	revealing	spent bullet	cases.	On	the	ground,	I	noticed	a	card.	Curious,	I	picked	it	up	and	saw	the image	of	the	Grim	Reaper.	It	was	a	tarot	card	of	Death,	the	adopted	sign	of	Black October.	Yes,	the	enemy	was	within	as	well	as	without. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	time	to	leave	before	more	police	arrived,	or	soldiers	asking	awkward questions	about	why	I	was	there.	They	wouldn’t	be	too	concerned	about arresting	an	innocent	passer-by.	I	hurried	away	down	the	street,	leaving	the	flies to	their	feast,	and	the	cops	to	their	silent	vigil	in	the	next	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">AFTER	my	grisly	discovery,	I	decided	to	take	a	more	direct	route	towards Commerce	Square,	where	the	main	government	buildings	are	located.	The	area was	a	virtual	fortress.	Razor	wire	and	military	vehicles	barricaded	the	streets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	could	only	enter	by	showing	identification	to	the	police	that	watched	over the	fortifications. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	my	place	in	a	short	queue	of	people	waiting	to	enter	the	square.	The ominous	bulk	of	a	Terran	troop	carrier	loomed	above	us.	The	vehicle’s	steely-eyed	commander	watched	us,	with	one	arm	resting	on	a	mounted	machine	gun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Papers!”	Hastily	I	showed	the	sentry	my	passport,	removing	my	sunglasses	so he	could	get	a	good	look	at	my	face.	The	officer	regarded	my	passport	for	a	long time,	and	then	switched	his	focus	to	stare	at	me	with	fierce	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	your	business?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	want	papers	out	of	the	city.	I’ve	got	a	job	to	do,	after	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	officer	said	nothing.	His	expression	was	unreadable,	but	I	sensed	his boredom.	Without	a	word,	he	returned	my	documents	and	I	entered	the	square.	It was	ominous	with	activity.	Military	vehicles	were	parked	in	corners,	mostly troop	carriers,	but	by	the	statue	of	Nigel	Chamberlain10	I	saw	a	tank	parked askew.	The	vehicle’s	commander	barked	orders	at	a	group	of	soldiers	standing beneath	its	menacing	bulk.	At	its	rear,	a	group	of	grimy	engineers	investigated the	machine’s	engine. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>The	air	was	filled	with	the	sound	of	shrieked	orders.	NCOs	mercilessly	drilled the	rank	and	file	troops.	Heavy	boots	thundered	on	the	flagstones	in	perfect unison,	and	the	diesel	engines	added	to	the	sounds	of	a	fortress	under	war footing.	A	gunship	roared	overhead,	downdraft	whipping	at	the	litter	on	the flagstones,	the	thrashing	of	its	rotors	bombarding	my	ears.	It	came	in	to	land	on the	eastern	side	of	the	square,	and	heavily	armed	troops	leapt	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	approached	the	Board	of	Colonial	Affairs,	a	young	militia	sentry	stopped me	and	asked	for	my	papers.	Sighing,	I	dug	out	my	passport	and	handed	it	to him.	He	studied	it	even	more	closely	than	the	police	officer	at	the	entrance	to	the square	until	I	began	to	feel	pangs	of	random	guilt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	heard	about	the	defections,”	I	asked,	more	to	break	my	tension	than anything	else,	“what	do	you	think	of	it	all?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	traitors!	They’ve	turned	their	backs	on	the	Motherworld	for	some foolish	dream,	but	we’ll	give	them	a	dose	of	reality.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anybody	you	know	gone	over,	any	friends?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	soldier	stared	at	me	and	the	anger	in	the	boy’s	eyes	was	truly	frightening.	“If they’ve	gone	over,	they’re	not	my	friends!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	left	the	soldier.	Rich	powermongers	on	a	distant	world	he	had	never	seen, would	spend	his	life	without	a	second	thought	in	the	defence	of	their	privileges.	I shook	my	head	in	pity	for	this	young	lad,	barely	18,	who	clung	indignantly	to	his sense	of	duty,	and	never	once	questioned	what	he	was	told.	It	was	one	small tragedy	in	a	swelling	ocean. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside	the	building,	the	air	was	cooler,	but	it	was	crawling	with	people.	Civil servants	hurried	about	on	their	business,	stumbling	and	cursing	as	they	struggled through	the	crowds	of	soldiers	billeted	there.	Windows	were	heavily sandbagged,	reducing	the	light	to	a	depressing	gloom.	Every	available	space	was stacked	with	arms	and	ammunition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	important-looking	official	in	a	smart	business	suit	stormed	angrily	out	of	a room,	proclaiming	to	the	world	in	general	his	opposition	to	the	conference	room being	turned	into	a	makeshift	field	hospital.	Nobody	paid	him	any	attention	and he	stomped	off	in	a	huff. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>Stumbling	between	the	soldiers,	I	made	my	way	to	the	lift.	A	sign	suggested	it was	for	officers’	use	only.	I	ignored	it	and	took	the	lift	up	to	the	second	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	doors	opened	onto	another	corridor	packed	with	soldiers.	The	stench	of	so many	sweating	bodies	was	very	nearly	overpowering,	despite	the	building’s	air conditioning	being	turned	on	full	blast.	I’m	glad	I	didn’t	have	to	work	there.	It was	stifling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowly	I	made	my	way	to	the	office	dealing	with	transport	passes.	I	wasn’t surprised	by	the	lack	of	a	queue,	and	I	sat	down	at	a	desk	where	a	harassed looking	official	was	busy	flicking	through	papers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hahem!”	I	coughed,	to	make	my	presence	known.	The	official	looked	up	and abruptly	slipped	the	papers	into	a	drawer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	morning,	what	can	I	do	for	you?”	she	asked	with	forced	politeness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perspiration	beaded	her	forehead,	and	her	eyes	suggested	fatigue	behind	her	thin glasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	showed	her	my	passport	before	speaking.	“I’m	Sue	Reid,	of	the	Martian Chronicle.	I’d	like	passes	for	myself	and	several	of	my	colleagues.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sorry	Ms	Reid,	but	we	can’t	allow	foreign	journalists	beyond	the	city	limits, safety	reasons	you	understand	-” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	understand	certain	reporters	have	been	allowed	to	leave	the	city.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only	under	very	special	circumstances.	And	at	the	understanding	that	the Government	of	Greyermede	would	hold	no	responsibility	for	their	safety.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled	and	slid	my	press	credentials	over.	“But	mine	is	a	special circumstance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	official	looked	at	the	hundred	Yen	note	I	had	slipped	beneath	my	card.	She stared	at	it	for	some	time,	then	casually	-	a	well-practised	movement	in	fact	-	she slipped	the	money	into	her	pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I	understand.	How	many	passes	will	you	need?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	half	a	dozen,”	I	replied	casually.	The	woman	took	out	a	number	of	pre-printed	cards	signed	with	the	Police	Minister’s	name,	and	countersigned	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>Then	she	slipped	them	over	towards	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	get	your	colleagues	to	sign	these	passes,	and	they	can	be	used	right	away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you!”	I	hastily	pocketed	the	passes.	Then	I	made	my	way	out	of	the building	as	quickly	as	I	could.	As	I	left,	I	wished	I’d	lubricated	the	wheels	of bureaucracy	a	little	earlier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">MANY	of	the	journalists	were	still	in	the	lobby-bar	when	I	returned.	I	walked	in feeling	hot	and	tired	but	eager	to	get	underway.	A	few	of	the	journalists	shouted a	greeting.	I	just	strode	up	to	the	centre	of	the	bar	waving	the	passes	in	my	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	you	armchair	newshounds,	who	wants	to	leave	the	city?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	must	admit	I’d	hoped	for	a	better	response.	“What,	go	out	into	bandit	country?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">someone	said.	Most	of	the	others	declined	my	offer.	They	were	too	comfortable claiming	their	drinks-expenses,	and	going	through	the	press	releases	to	bother going	anywhere	else.	Let	the	Revolution	come	to	them,	seemed	to	be	the	general attitude. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	passes	did	attract	some	interest,	though.	Chris	Harding,	the	Chronicle photographer	I	was	working	with,	jumped	at	the	chance	to	leave	Firsthaven.	So did	a	couple	of	others.	That	left	two	passes	spare	with	no	takers.	I	threw	them down	on	a	beer	stained	table	and	walked	out.	No	snide	comments	followed.	That surprised	me,	maybe	I’d	struck	a	few	consciences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">TWO	hours	later	Chris	and	I	were	on	the	road.	We	had	a	car	at	our	disposal, courtesy	of	the	Press	Office,	and	were	heading	for	the	M286	to	Teliote.	The	city-exit	was	guarded	by	militia	troops.	Machine	guns	had	been	mounted	on	either side	of	the	road,	covering	both	approaches	to	and	from	the	city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	stopped	the	car	as	one	of	the	militiamen	flagged	us	down.	“Passes!”	he bellowed.	I	handed	the	documents	to	Chris,	who	then	handed	them	to	the	guard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	studied	them	for	a	few	moments	before	returning	them.	With	a	wave	of	his arm,	the	militiaman	signalled	the	barrier	to	be	opened	and	waved	us	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gratefully	we	drove	through	the	barrier.	We	were	in	Red	territory	now,	and	a brief	shiver	of	fear	did	pass	through	my	body.	Here	Government	authority	was worth	little,	even	to	Government	troops. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a>Thankfully,	the	journey	was	uneventful.	We	passed	kilometres	of	swaying	cereal crops	to	the	north.	There	was	little	traffic	on	the	road.	After	about	two	hours,	the city	of	Teliote	loomed	ahead.	This	was	one	of	many	regions	contested	by	both sides.	We	would	be	watching	as	they	struggled	to	take	the	city.	It	would	be interesting	to	see	who	conquered. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	10</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">TRAFALGAR	was	beset	by	class	struggle,	white	hot	and	furious.	Armed	by	the militia,	the	workers	engaged	the	Terran	troops	and	armed	police.	Untrained	and inexperienced	the	workers	of	the	city	were	doing	the	seemingly	impossible:	they were	defeating	one	of	the	most	terrible	killing	machines	in	the	galaxy.	All	their state-of-the-art	hardware	did	not	help	the	Terran	military	put	down	the	armies	of the	workers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	street	battle	after	street	battle,	the	soldiers	fled,	leaving	the	dead	and	scores	of weapons	to	further	arm	the	builders	of	the	Revolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	fighting	progressed,	order	was	slowly	restored	to	the	districts	under	Red control.	Volunteer	bands	of	workers,	under	the	control	of	the	newly	elected workers’	Council,	worked	to	keep	the	peace	and	stop	the	looting	and	anarchy that	had	befallen	since	the	collapse	of	the	Colonial	state’s	authority.	The	Council took	over	the	running	of	the	city;	electricity,	communications,	transport, distribution	of	food	and	other	necessary	goods,	co-ordination	of	the	hospitals	and medical	facilities,	and	a	host	of	other	essential	services. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	the	Militia	Revolutionary	Committee	was	charged	the	defence	of	the Revolution.	Under	its	elected	high	command,	a	more	than	adequate	job	of combating	the	Terran	troops	was	executed.	The	city	was	fast	falling	to	the	Reds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“WE	were	waiting,”	Carter	said.	“The	fear	and	apprehension	was	a	physical presence.	You	could	smell	it	in	the	air,	hear	it	in	the	strange	silence	of	the	city, feel	its	cold	tentacles	slithering	down	the	spine.	Life	was	on	hold	as	the	future waited	for	the	dawn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“After	days	of	hard	fighting,	the	Red	Guard	and	the	militia	were	gathered	in	the streets	around	the	Central	Police	Station.	Here	the	counter-revolutionary	forces awaited	their	last	stand.	They	knew	they	were	lost,	but	futile	pride	-	or	perhaps deadly	fear	-	demanded	they	stay	and	fight	to	the	last. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	minutes	passed	by	like	years.	The	moons	sank	beneath	the	level	of	sight, behind	the	dark	towers	of	the	city.	Slowly	the	sun	rose	behind	the	buildings, highlighting	them	ever	more	starkly	as	tall	silhouettes.	As	dawn	progressed	our vision	extended.	Cautiously	I	looked	down	Vernon	Drive,	casting	my	eyes	over</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>the	fortified	structure	of	the	police	station	at	its	far	end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	street	was	barricaded	with	abandoned	cars.	Coils	of	razor	wire	further protected	the	approaches,	leaving	only	a	small	gap	by	which	vehicles	and	troops could	come	and	go.	The	barricades	and	sandbagged	fortifications	of	the	police station	could	just	be	made	out	in	the	dull	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thousands	of	workers	and	militia	troops	waited	nervously	for	the	attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nobody	uttered	a	word.	They	just	sat	staring	into	space	or	toyed	nervously	with the	weapons	they	were	only	just	beginning	to	get	used	to	handling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	the	sun	came	into	view,	a	jeep	drove	towards	our	positions.	A	white	flag	was tied	to	the	radio	aerial,	which	fluttered	in	the	breeze.	Howard	Kramer,	and Ahmed	Hussain	of	the	city	Council	and	Militia	Revolutionary	Committee	sat	in the	vehicle.	Hussain	chewed	his	lower	lip,	Kramer’s	forehead	glistened	in	the poor	light,	and	his	eyes	held	a	distant	look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Comrades!’	Kramer	shouted	as	the	jeep	came	to	a	halt.	‘As	representatives	of the	revolutionary	masses	we	are	going	to	try	one	last	time	and	avoid	this senseless	slaughter!	We	go	under	a	flag	of	truce	to	demand	that	our	enemies	lay down	their	arms.	Let	us	hope	that	they	see	the	sense	in	this	course	of	action.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Good	luck!’	somebody	shouted.	It	was	well	meant,	but	at	the	same	time contained	little	hope.	Nobody	really	believed	the	enemy	would	lay	down	their arms	without	a	fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kramer	sat	down	again,	his	face	almost	as	pale	as	the	flag.	The	vehicle	jerked into	motion	and	drove	slowly	down	Vernon	Drive.	We	watched	in	apprehension as	it	stopped	a	little	way	towards	the	barricades.	Kramer	was	a	little	figure	in	the distance,	dwarfed	by	the	enormity	of	the	buildings	and	the	barricade,	and perhaps	by	the	events	that	had	swept	us	all	up,	even	as	we	created	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	caught	the	distant	sounds	of	his	voice,	amplified	and	made	harsh	by	a megaphone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Followers	of	Earth!’	he	cried.	‘We,	the	representatives	of	the	revolutionary masses	of	this	city,	have	come	to	grant	you	one	last	chance.	Lay	down	your	arms and	surrender.	Your	safety	is	guaranteed	if	you	give	up	your	hopeless	position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	is	no	need	for	this	senseless	-‘</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>The	sharp	crack	of	a	rifle	drowned	out	his	words.	Kramer	collapsed	into	his	seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	jeep	swung	round	and	raced	madly	towards	our	positions.	Gunfire	followed in	its	wake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘There’s	our	answer,’	someone	said	to	me.	I	nodded	in	reply.	There	had	been little	likelihood	of	any	other	outcome.	The	jeep	screeched	to	a	halt,	and	the driver	screamed	for	a	medic.	Kramer	sat	in	his	seat	moaning.	Blood	stained	his shirt.	The	bullet	had	struck	him	in	the	shoulder	but	he	was	lucky	that	he	had come	out	so	lightly	from	his	attempt	to	avert	a	fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	time	had	come.	Behind	me	I	heard	the	muttered	words	of	someone	in prayer.	Fear	spread	through	us,	but	also	a	grim	determination.	By	nightfall	the city	would	be	ours,	but	we	knew	there	would	be	many	dead	to	bury	afterwards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	the	order	came	to	attack,	breaking	the	tension	in	a	rush	of	adrenaline. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	militia	troop	carrier	rumbled	down	the	street,	its	mounted	guns	chattering	as it	advanced.	Behind	it	the	armed	workers	and	militia	advanced.	Down	the	street, points	of	light	flashed	as	our	enemy	returned	fire.	Gouts	of	dust	erupted	as bullets	tore	down	the	street,	and	smashed	into	the	Terran	barricades,	sometimes finding	a	human	mark.	Comrades	fell	around	me,	crying	in	agony	as	a	bullet found	its	target.	From	further	away	came	the	sounds	of	fresh	gunfire	as revolutionaries	assaulted	the	enemy	position	from	other	streets	bordering	the police	station. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Soldiers	appeared	on	our	flank	as	we	approached.	Guns	flared	and	several	of my	comrades	went	down.	The	fire	was	returned.	I	squeezed	the	electronic	trigger of	my	assault	rifle,	feeling	it	kick	into	life.	Explosions	of	blood	ripped	across	the bodies	of	several	of	our	attackers	as	the	armour-piercing	bullets	bit	eagerly	into flesh.	The	remaining	troops	fled	into	the	cover	of	the	building,	pursued	by detachments	of	Red	Guard	and	militia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	barricades	were	coming	closer	when	the	sound	of	a	heavy	diesel	engine emerged	above	the	noise	of	battle.	A	Terran	tank	turned	the	corner	and	came towards	us.	The	muzzle	of	its	gun	spat	flames	and	roared.	The	armoured personnel	carrier	erupted	in	flame	and	lazily	crashed	through	a	shop	front. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cries	of	terror	erupted	all	around	me.	The	tank	turned	its	attention	to	us.	Heavy machine	guns	tore	great	holes	in	our	ranks	as	we	ran	for	cover	behind	abandoned cars	and	shop	fronts.	Slowly	it	came	ever	forward.	Behind	it	were	the	shadowy</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p63"></a>figures	of	troops	and	armed	police,	shrouded	in	smoke	from	the	fire.	The	tank was	beyond	our	small	arms,	but	we	engaged	those	soldiers	in	a	bitter	fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Two	militiamen	ran	up	to	a	car	opposite	me.	The	tank	was	coming	closer, grinding	the	dead	under	its	armoured	tracks.	One	man	cradled	a	shoulder-launched	anti-tank	missile	in	his	arms.	On	the	other	side	of	the	street	the militiaman	left	his	cover,	and	crouched	in	the	armoured	monster’s	path	as	we distracted	the	enemy’s	attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	missile	fired,	leaving	a	trail	of	dense,	white	smoke.	The	shell	struck	and	a terrible	boom	echoed	down	the	street	as	the	warhead	exploded.	A	great	ball	of flame	blossomed,	thick	black	smoke	billowed	at	its	edge.	As	the	smoke	cleared the	tank	emerged	from	its	dark	veil,	unharmed.	The	militiaman	was	cut	down	in the	street	as	the	tank	opened	fire	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	this	tank	would	defeat	us,	but	then	fragments	of	glass	cascaded	onto the	street	and	the	roar	of	many	guns	blasted	from	the	first	floor	windows.	The troops	behind	fled	in	disarray.	Then	Red	Guard	and	militia	leapt	from	the window	and	landed	on	top	of	the	tank.	Several	were	killed	by	gunfire	but	enough kept	coming,	braving	the	bullets	to	bind	the	tank’s	intakes	in	oily	rags.	Even	a tank	such	as	that	needed	to	breathe.	Impervious	to	chemical	and	biological weaponry,	protected	against	nuclear	fallout,	it	was	not	impervious	to	air.	That was	its	Achilles	Heel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	tank	stopped	as	its	engines	failed.	Its	guns	fell	silent.	Hatches	began	to open	and	its	crew	desperately	gasped	for	air.	A	hail	of	lead	met	them	as	they abandoned	their	vehicle,	and	the	revolutionaries	stormed	past	the	machine’s	iron corpse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Another	troop	carrier	roared	by,	blasting	the	barricades	with	its	guns	and smashing	through	the	defences.	Hordes	of	Red	Guard	and	militia	flooded through	in	its	wake.	Sweeping	the	barricades	in	bullets,	we	found	only	corpses as	we	breached	their	outer	defences.	Across	the	grounds	we	saw	more	of	our comrades	as	they	broke	through.	Swept	up	on	this	tide,	the	Terran	troops	and police	were	retreating	to	the	court	building	and	the	police	station.	Many	were consumed	in	the	Red	Tide,	and	many	more	fell	as	they	ran. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	enemy’s	last	haven	was	battered	by	a	revolutionary	storm.	The	buildings were	surrounded	by	Red	Guard	and	militia,	taking	cover	behind	abandoned</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>military	vehicles	and	the	troop	carriers	of	the	militia.	Shots	were	exchanged,	but we	made	no	moves	to	assault	the	buildings.	They	were	well	fortified.	Many would	have	been	killed	in	the	attempt	to	clear	our	enemies	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	leaned	against	a	troop	carrier.	Exhausted,	I	wondered	what	would	happen next.	As	I	waited	I	looked	about	the	grounds,	searching	for	those	I	knew.	The place	was	littered	with	the	dead.	Smoke	drifted	in	misty	coils	on	the	breeze	and the	air	was	thick	with	the	smell	of	gunsmoke	and	blood.	The	pool	outside	the courthouse	was	filled	with	bodies	and	the	fountains	sprayed	pink.	The	water	was drawn	from	the	pool,	and	much	blood	had	polluted	it.	On	the	edge	of	the	pool the	body	of	a	Terran	officer	rested.	One	arm	trailed	lifelessly	into	the	water,	the officer’s	eyes	were	staring	blankly	at	me.	The	side	of	his	skull	had	been	blown away,	the	tattered	remnants	of	his	crimson-stained	beret	floated	in	the	water	as	it lapped	the	edges. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	thoughts	pondered	who	the	man	might	have	been;	was	he	really	a	savage killer,	what	lies	led	him	to	die	so	far	away	from	home	and	his	loved	ones, wouldn’t	he	rather	have	been	with	them?	I	shivered	and	pushed	the	thoughts away.	A	battlefield	is	no	place	for	such	introspection.	At	home,	with	my	loved ones,	that	would	be	the	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	voice	was	raised	suddenly,	echoing	about	the	square	in	a	sharp	counterpoint to	the	earlier	sounds	of	the	fighting.	One	last	attempt	was	being	made	to	end	the fighting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Lay	down	your	arms!’	the	speaker	was	shouting,	I	didn’t	know	who	he	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘This	is	your	last	chance.	If	you	don’t	give	up	this	pointless	struggle	then	we’ll take	steps	to	blast	you	out!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	was	no	reply	to	his	words,	but	a	strange	silence	descended.	The	words	of the	speaker	quickly	became	clear	as	militiamen	cautiously	approached	our positions,	carrying	heavy	boxes	between	them.	In	a	dreadful	silence	the	boxes were	broken	open	and	the	graceful	forms	of	anti-tank	missiles	were	revealed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	score	of	militiamen	and	women	raised	the	weapons	and	sighted	down	their computer-targeting	systems.	Five	rockets	were	fired	through	the	glass	doors	of the	courthouse,	which	shattered	in	a	glittering	cascade	as	the	sun	caught	the fragments.	Seconds	later	a	series	of	explosions	ripped	through	the	building.	A ball	of	orange	flame	gushed	from	the	ruined	doors,	part	of	the	roof	was	torn</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a>away	as	flame	and	smoke	and	debris	was	blasted	over	the	grounds.	The	shock waves	smashed	through	the	air	in	a	dreadful	boom.	Another	salvo	was	sent	into the	ravaged	building.	More	flames	and	smoke	engulfed	the	ruin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	the	courts	were	bombarded	so	was	the	police	station.	Rocket	salvos	blasted through	the	main	doors.	They	too	blew	outwards	in	a	cascade	of	glass	fragments as	flame	and	smoke	gushed	out.	The	entire	glass	facade	of	the	upper	floors	burst out	as	a	ball	of	flame	engulfed	the	building’s	innards,	showering	the	grounds with	a	hail	of	shattered	glass	and	twisted	metal.	Fire	began	to	greedily	consume the	rest	of	the	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	revolutionaries	looked	on	as	figures	began	to	emerge	from	the	smoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grimy	and	bloodstained,	the	survivors	began	to	leave	the	building.	Moaning hideously,	injured	men	were	helped	by	their	comrades	as	the	defeated	enemy filed	out	slowly,	fearfully.	Arms	raised	in	surrender	they	threw	themselves	on	the mercy	of	the	revolutionary	masses	and	expected	none. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Surging	triumphantly	forward,	the	armies	of	the	workers	herded	away	the prisoners	and	stormed	the	building.	Five	minutes	later	the	building	was	clear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	last	haven	of	old	Trafalgar	was	routed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	prisoners	were	taken	away;	the	injured	to	the	hospitals,	the	others	to	the	old prisons	where	they	were	held,	awaiting	the	outcome	of	the	World	Revolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“After	a	hard,	desperate	fight,	the	revolutionary	masses	won	the	day.	Many	were dead	or	injured.	There	was	a	lot	to	do	but	the	rebuilding	of	the	city	could	now begin.	For	that	moment	though,	the	victory	had	not	yet	sunk	in.	By	nightfall	the city	would	be	in	celebration.	We	were	all	a	long	way	from	that	tragic	day	in October.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	RED	TIDE</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	11</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">FROM	all	over	the	world	we	heard	news	of	cities	falling	to	the	workers,	of	the old	regime	crumbling.	The	remnants	of	the	broadcasting	services	still	in Government	hands	were	hard-pressed	to	counter	the	Red	message.	In	fact,	they had	lost	the	battle	to	control	the	airwaves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Already	party	organisations	were	discussing	the	formation	of	the	first	workers’</p>
<p class="calibre1">government.	These	people	didn’t	even	needed	to	leave	their	own	cities.	With	the assistance	of	the	capitalists’	old	conferencing	systems,	party	delegates	talked	to one-another	over	the	divide.	The	elected	representatives	of	the	world’s	working class	‘gathered’	to	form	a	historic	new	form	of	government.	In	thousands	of buildings	scattered	across	the	colony,	merged	into	one	unit	through	the	aid	of satellite	communication	networks,	a	new	democratic	era	was	being	forged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IN	the	meantime	Dutton	and	the	old	Government	remained	cooped	up	inside Firsthaven.	Still	they	plotted	and	planned	their	conspiracies	against	the Revolution.	Somehow	deluded	as	to	the	real	situation	they	faced.	The	media services	that	remained	to	them	pumped	out	horror	story	after	horror	story concerning	the	‘atrocities’	of	the	revolutionaries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	Trafalgar,	they	were	accused	of	mass	murder.	The	soldiers	and	police	were rounded	up	and	killed	en	masse,	the	allegation	ran.	The	Government	poured abuse	on	the	Revolution,	its	tone	shocked	and	full	of	moral	outrage.	Seemingly, it	forgot	the	massacres	of	unarmed	civilians	its	own	security	forces	conducted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	in	Trafalgar	by	the	time	these	accusations	surfaced.	More	Government	lies, I	suspected,	and	I	resolved	to	find	the	truth.	The	task	didn’t	prove	as	difficult	as	I expected.	The	revolutionaries	were	eager	to	counter	these	allegations.	They begged	me	to	visit	the	old	SecurCom	Correction	Centre	where	the	uninjured prisoners	were	held.	The	place	was	way	outside	the	city,	but	I	agreed	to	go.	The city’s	ex-mayor	came	along,	since	he	made	the	initial	accusation.	Listening	to	his wittering	hardly	made	the	journey	any	more	pleasant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside	the	prison	I	was	presented	to	the	prisoners.	“This	is	Sue	Reid,	a	journalist from	Mars.	She	has	asked	to	see	how	we	treat	our	prisoners,	so	we	agreed	to	her coming	here	to	speak	to	you,”	the	militia	Corporal	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a>I	was	allowed	to	roam	freely	amongst	the	prisoners	in	the	exercise	yard.	One	of the	inmates	approached	me	urgently.	“My	family	think	I’m	dead.	Please,	can	you deliver	this?”	The	man	quickly	pushed	a	folded	envelope	into	my	hand	before	I could	answer.	Then	he	disappeared	into	the	crowd	of	prisoners.	The	letter	was addressed	to	Montreal,	Canada,	Earth.	The	revolutionaries	couldn’t	inform	his family	of	his	well	being.	The	Government	wouldn’t	for	the	sake	its	own propaganda. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well?	What	about	your	accusation	now?”	I	asked	the	ex-mayor	of	the	city, when	we	stood	outside	the	prison	gates	once	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	be	a	fool!”	he	retorted	angrily.	“Those	are	communists	wearing	the uniforms	of	their	victims.	Are	you	really	so	easily	fooled	Ms	Reid?”	The Corporal	in	charge	of	the	prison	just	rolled	his	eyes	before	escorting	us	to	our car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	next	day	I	publicised	my	findings	in	a	report	on	the	revolutionaries’</p>
<p class="calibre1">broadcasting	network.	Still	shots	taken	by	Chris	Harding	were	published	in	the city’s	press	and	distributed	through	the	press	agencies	all	over	the	planet.	Yet, the	Government	still	insisted	these	men	were	all	rotting	in	a	hidden	grave.	The prisoner’s	letter	I	posted	to	the	Martian	News	Network	press	office	in	Trafalgar, for	delivery	off	world.	I	never	found	out	if	it	was	delivered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	course,	the	Government	was	right	in	a	way.	The	revolutionaries	did	commit the	worst	form	of	atrocity	the	Terran	mind	could	envisage.	The	people	of Greyermede	seized	‘their’	property.	And	more	than	that,	they	assumed production	for	their	own	needs	rather	than	offworld	profit.	A	terrible	atrocity indeed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">TIME	was	finally	running	out	for	the	old	Government	in	Firsthaven.	Every	day since	the	fall	of	Trafalgar,	Minsky	and	other	revolutionary	leaders	were	on	the television,	appealing	to	the	workers	to	overthrow	the	Revolution’s	enemies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Members	of	the	city	Council	issued	proclamations	and	reports	to	the	inhabitants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handbills	flooded	the	city	streets,	flysheets	were	posted	on	every	available space,	and	communications	networks	buzzed	with	messages	and	information	as the	city	organised	for	the	conquest	of	Firsthaven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	City	Hall,	the	Council	and	the	Militia	Revolutionary	Committee exchanged	frenzied	faxes	and	phone	messages	with	workers’	organisations</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>active	in	the	capital,	organising	the	final	insurrection	that	would	bring Greyermede	fully	into	workers’	control. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	19th	December,	everything	was	ready.	Revolutionaries	in	Firsthaven were	preparing.	The	Government’s	end	was	nigh. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	12</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“AN	urgent	hammering	woke	me	up,”	Angela	said.	“Bleary-eyed,	I	groped	for my	alarm	clock,	the	time	was	10	a.m.	I	swore,	and	slowly	crawled	out	of	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	hammering	pounded	against	the	door	again,	I	thought	it	would	be knocked	off	its	hinges. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘All	right,	I’m	coming!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	opened	to	reveal	Jenny	and	Clare,	a	couple	of	friends	from	work.	They lived	a	few	streets	away	from	me,	but	I	hadn’t	seen	them	for	some	time.	Vaguely I	wondered	what	they	wanted	that	was	so	urgent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Christ!	You’re	not	even	dressed	yet!’	Jenny	said	as	she	walked	through	the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Why?	What’s	wrong?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘It’s	started,’	Clare	said.	‘The	revolutionaries	are	coming!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘What?	When	did	all	this	happen?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Never	mind,	just	get	dressed.	We’ve	got	to	hurry.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Clare	pushed	me	towards	the	stairs.	I	didn’t	know	what	was	going	on,	but	I went	along	with	them.	Once	dressed	Jenny	sat	down	on	the	settee	and	told	me	all about	the	morning’s	events.	The	revolutionaries	were	coming	to	town;	the	final showdown	with	the	Government	was	due	sometime	in	the	afternoon.	The	whole city’s	working	population	was	turning	out	to	support	the	revolutionaries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Come	on,	let’s	go,’	Clare	said.	We	left	my	house	and	climbed	into	Jenny’s	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	streets	were	uncannily	quiet	on	the	way	into	the	city	centre.	The	car	passed by	rows	of	lifeless	houses	and	empty	streets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Where	is	everybody?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Just	about	everybody’s	in	town.	Like	I	said,	it’s	the	big	day!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	car	turned	into	the	main	road	leading	down	into	the	city	centre.	The	tall</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p70"></a>buildings	could	now	be	seen,	covered	in	a	faint	heat-haze.	Jenny	sped	down	the road	and	soon	we	were	in	the	town	centre. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	difference	was	incredible.	The	streets	suddenly	filled	with	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thousands	upon	thousands	milling	about	or	wandering	on	some	errand.	It	was	as though	every	single	shop	had	opened	their	doors	for	some	monumental	sale.	Of course	they	hadn’t.	Every	shop	we	passed	was	closed	or	boarded	up.	From behind	windows	we	caught	sight	of	shop-owners	or	management	staring	out	at the	crowds	with	unconcealed	hostility. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Soon	the	roads	themselves	were	packed	with	people.	On	street	corners,	crowds gathered	to	listen	to	speakers.	Party	activists	or	just	ordinary	citizens	proclaimed news	of	the	Revolution	to	an	eager	audience.	Nowhere	could	we	see	a	cop	or soldier.	The	Government	forces	had	melted	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	roads	became	too	crowded	for	the	car	to	go	on	any	further.	Jenny	parked and	we	immersed	ourselves	in	the	crowd.	A	wall	of	noise	pummelled	my	ears	as thousands	of	chattering	voices	and	shouted	debates	filled	the	air.	People	eagerly discussed	politics.	People	who	once	upon	a	time	would	have	only	been interested	in	the	latest	sports	results	or	the	trivial	rubbish	in	the	latest	tabloid	rag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Where	are	we	going,	anyway?’	I	asked.	I	didn’t	know	why	they’d	brought	me, but	I	was	glad	they	did.	The	atmosphere	was	great.	It	felt	like	one	big	party,	and I	could	feel	myself	getting	caught	up	in	the	excitement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘The	station!’	Angela	replied.	But	she	didn’t	say	why. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Slowly	we	made	our	way	towards	the	city’s	main	station.	The	closer	we	got	the more	activity	emerged.	Open	air	rallies.	Heated	debates	between	revolutionary workers	and	some	of	the	middle	class	who	turned	up	to	see	what	was	going	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amidst	the	teeming	sea	of	humanity	I	caught	sight	of	people	I	vaguely recognised.	I	didn’t	know	them	but	I’d	seen	them	before.	Harassed	looking individuals	trying	to	sell	papers,	while	keeping	an	eye	out	for	cops,	in	calmer times	before	the	Revolution.	Now	they	were	harassed	again,	but	for	different reasons.	Hordes	of	people	beset	them,	eager	to	buy	the	publications	of	any revolutionary	party	that	happened	to	be	around.	Everybody	was	hungry	for	news from	the	rest	of	the	colony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Someone	pushed	a	handbill	into	my	hand.	Briefly,	I	scanned	through	it.	It	was hurriedly	prepared	and	of	poor	quality,	but	it	did	the	job	of	spreading</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>information	about	the	proposals	for	the	first	workers’	government	of	the	planet.	I threw	it	aside	when	I’d	finished	with	it.	It	drifted	on	the	breeze	with	the thousands	of	other	handbills,	like	flakes	of	oversized	snow,	collecting	in	great drifts	of	paper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	great	mass	of	people	seemed	to	be	going	our	way	towards	the	station.	Jenny, Clare	and	I	joined	the	teeming	throng.	The	crowd	turned	a	corner	in	the	street and	there	before	us	stood	the	huge,	utilitarian	facade	of	Firsthaven	Station.	I gasped	in	shock	as	I	saw	the	building.	It	was	draped	in	flags	and	banners. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everywhere	I	looked,	red	fists	billowed	in	the	breeze.	Banners	emblazoned	with the	GCP’s	initials	adorned	windows	and	doors,	lampposts	and	walls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	station	was	filled	with	people.	Outside,	a	police	riot	van	and	a	Terran	APC</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	parked.	Their	crews	were	gathered	outside,	positioned	as	though	to	attack the	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An	officer	yelled	orders	to	those	inside,	but	on	our	arrival	he	turned	and	gazed fearfully	in	our	direction.	For	a	moment,	I	thought	they’d	fire	on	us.	Yet,	the people	around	me	displayed	no	fear.	The	officer	barked	orders	at	the	men	under his	command.	Clambering	hastily	into	their	vehicles,	they	fled,	rumbling	down the	next	street	intersecting	with	the	station’s	entrance.	Behind	them	the	station workers	laughed	and	threw	insults	in	their	wake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	became	clear	what	this	crowd	had	gathered	for.	It	was	part	of	a	planned objective	to	take	the	main	station	into	the	city.	The	crowd	assembled	outside	the station,	while	others	filed	inside.	Seemingly	they	were	all	waiting	for	something to	happen,	but	I	didn’t	know	what.	GCP	activists	began	to	race	around organising	the	masses.	One	of	them	addressed	the	crowd	with	a	megaphone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Your	attention	please!’	he	shouted.	‘The	station	is	now	in	the	hands	of	the revolutionary	workers.	There	is	still	no	sign	of	the	counter-revolutionaries anywhere	in	the	city	other	than	around	the	haven	of	the	tyrant,	Dutton.	Please spread	the	word	for	the	people	to	be	vigilant.	The	enemy	of	socialism	could strike	at	any	time!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Let’s	go	inside,’	Clare	said	to	me.	I	followed	my	two	friends	into	the	station’s main	concourse.	The	display	boards	were	blank.	There	had	been	no	traffic	for several	days.	Inside,	the	building	was	a	hive	of	activity.	Party	activists	from several	revolutionary	parties	hurried	to-and-fro,	performing	allotted	tasks	that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a>were	a	complete	mystery	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Clare!	Jenny!’	someone	shouted	from	across	the	concourse.	We	looked	about for	the	speaker.	A	man	waved	from	a	cafe	and	approached	us.	His	face	was	split in	a	grin	and	his	eyes	shone	with	excitement.	On	his	arm	was	a	band	of	red	cloth signifying	him	as	one	of	the	GCP’s	organisers.	From	his	shoulder	a	machine pistol	dangled	heavily.	I	shivered	at	the	sight	of	it,	the	only	weapon	in	Red	hands I’d	seen	all	that	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Gary!’	Jenny	cried.	‘How	are	things	going?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Good.	Very	good	in	fact.	The	roads	into	the	city	have	been	cleared.	The	few troops	that	were	around	earlier	have	been	dispersed.	Seems	they’re	gathered around	Dutton	like	drones	around	a	queen	bee!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gary	noticed	me	gazing	at	his	gun.	‘Don’t	worry	about	this,	Angela.	I	sneaked into	the	city	this	morning	with	a	few	others.	There	are	still	counter-revolutionaries	out	there	so	we	need	to	protect	ourselves,	but	we	won’t	be	using these	unless	we	have	to!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘You	seem	to	know	a	lot	about	what’s	going	on.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘We	got	involved	a	few	weeks	ago.	We’ve	been	helping	to	get	this	off	the ground.	Not	like	you,	lounging	around	the	house	all	day!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Like	I	said.	Today	is	the	big	day!	Firsthaven’s	the	only	place	still	in Government	hands.	We’re	finally	going	to	kick	those	capitalist	bastards	right	off our	world!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Anything	we	can	do	to	help?’	Clare	asked.	Gary	bit	his	lip	in	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘You	could	help	with	the	paper	selling,	if	you	like.	They’re	a	little	rushed	off their	feet.	But	come	and	have	a	coffee	first.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Casually	we	walked	over	towards	the	cafe,	passing	groups	of	workers discussing	politics,	or	arguing	over	the	best	way	to	do	their	allotted	tasks.	Gary chattered	enthusiastically;	about	his	‘secret’	journey	into	Firsthaven,	the prospects	for	the	Revolution	expanding	beyond	Greyermede. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Attention!	Attention!	An	unscheduled	train	has	just	passed	the	three-kilometre</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a>safety	limit.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gary	cocked	his	head	at	the	synthesised	message.	‘Shit!	They’re	early.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘What’s	all	that	about?	Who’s	early?’	I	asked.	I	followed	as	my	companions hastily	made	their	way	to	platform	four. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘That’s	the	station’s	monitoring	computer.	It’s	still	running	to	the	old	timetable,’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gary	explained	on	the	way.	‘This	train’s	not	scheduled	on	any	computer’s timetable,	so	as	far	as	it	knows	there’s	a	possible	train	crash	about	to	happen.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“People	crowded	onto	platform	four,	but	station	workers	kept	many	back, keeping	the	platform	as	clear	as	possible.	Curious,	I	looked	down	the	track,	past the	monorail	pylons	that	disappeared	into	the	distance.	An	eerie	resonant	noise whirred	from	the	track	above	our	heads,	the	air	stank	of	burnt	grease	and	ozone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	distance	a	small	dot	appeared	on	the	track	and	soon	grew	larger	as	it rattled	on	towards	its	destination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	dot	became	a	train.	Its	bullet	nose	draped	in	the	flag	of	the	Revolution,	a huge	red	fist	punching	its	way	into	Firsthaven.	The	resonant	whirring	from	the tracks	grew	louder	as	the	train	approached.	The	whistling	rush	of	air	from	the train’s	slipstream	reached	my	ears	as	it	hurtled	along.	Then	its	brakes	screeched hideously	as	it	began	to	slow,	still	a	mile	from	the	platform.	Slowly	it	edged closer	until	it	finally	shuddered	to	a	halt	with	a	sharp	hiss	of	compressed	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	train	looked	damaged.	Bullet	holes	perforated	some	of	the	cabins	and several	windows	had	been	put	through.	But	that	hadn’t	dampened	the	enthusiasm of	those	on	board.	Hundreds	of	grinning,	excited	faces	peered	out	from	the windows.	Men	and	women	in	civilian	clothing	mingled	with	militia	uniforms, and	all	were	armed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Gary,	you	old	bastard!’	someone	cried	in	joy.	The	man	stepped	down	from	the first	cabin.	Behind	him	the	hordes	of	armed	people	were	disembarking	from	the train. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Rough	trip?’	Gary	asked	the	newcomer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘So	so,’	he	replied.	‘We	ran	into	a	few	counter-revolutionaries	about	thirty	miles back.	But	we	took	care	of	them!’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a>“‘How	are	things	in	Trafalgar?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Great!	We’re	starting	to	put	things	back	together	again.	I’d	be	there	now,	but we	heard	you	lot	needed	some	help!	I	always	said	people	in	the	capital	were soft.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	two	men	laughed	as	they	walked	back	into	the	concourse.	We	followed.	I looked	back	and	saw	the	ugly	boxes	of	guns	and	bullets	being	unloaded	from	the train.	A	shiver	of	fear	ran	through	my	body.	There	was	no	going	back;	it	wasn’t	a game	anymore,	it	was	reality.	The	people	of	Firsthaven	were	being	armed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	13</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">ABOUT	an	hour	after	the	first	train	pulled	into	Firsthaven	Station,	a	convoy	of militia	trucks	broke	through	the	M286	roadblock.	The	small	detachment	of troops	scattered	at	our	approach	without	so	much	as	a	shot	being	fired.	Those trucks	were	loaded	with	determined	bands	of	Red	Guard.	There	was	also	a journalist	hitching	a	ride. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	reached	the	city	centre	the	trucks	slowed	to	a	snail’s	pace.	The	streets were	so	crowded.	The	driver	in	the	lead	truck	blasted	at	the	crowds	with	the horn,	impatiently	cursing	under	his	breath.	The	crowds	broke	to	allow	the	trucks through,	albeit	slowly,	to	reform	like	a	thick	fluid	at	the	rear	of	the	convoy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually	the	trucks	reached	the	station	and	screeched	to	a	grateful	halt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	militia	and	Red	Guard	climbed	wearily	out	of	the	trucks.	Stretching	their tired	limbs,	they	shouted	greetings	to	comrades	whom	they	hadn’t	seen	for	some time.	Many	were	embracing	like	family,	others	chattering	and	laughing	loudly, not	caring	who	heard	them.	I	detached	myself	from	the	group	and	looked around.	What	most	concerned	me	then	was	finding	somewhere	to	eat:	I	was starved	and	dehydrated	from	the	journey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	there	a	cafe	around	here?”	I	asked	someone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Inside	the	station.”	I	let	the	woman	hurry	away	on	whatever	task	she	was	there to	do,	and	wandered	over	towards	the	station.	I	soon	caught	sight	of	the	cafe through	the	teeming	throng.	Once	inside,	I	ordered	a	coffee	and	a	sandwich	and sat	down	to	enjoy	the	first	food	I’d	had	since	early	morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cafe	was	full	of	people;	I’d	been	lucky	to	get	a	seat.	From	the	many conversations	that	were	going	on	around	me	I	caught	fragments	of	the	day’s events	so	far.	About	the	first	train	that	had	been	shot	at	by	Dutton’s	forces.	How the	counter-revolutionaries	had	been	keeping	out	of	the	way.	About	a detachment	of	Red	Guard	and	militia	that	had	gone	off	to	clear	out	what	was	left of	the	Terran	military	garrison	outside	the	city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Raised	voices	sounded	from	the	main	concourse.	I	looked	out	to	see	what	the commotion	was.	Luggage	trolleys	were	being	used	to	carry	boxes	outside	the station.	The	boxes	were	green	and	grey,	stencilled	with	harsh	white	lettering. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>Everything	about	them	suggested	a	military	purpose.	I	hastily	drained	the	rest	of my	coffee	and	left	the	cafe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside,	there	was	an	even	greater	commotion.	Two	trucks	were	parked	in	front of	the	building.	As	I	stood	and	watched,	the	boxes	were	broken	open	to	reveal guns	and	ammunition.	Under	the	guidance	of	the	militia	the	people	were	armed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	at	a	time	they	approached	the	first	truck,	where	they	were	handed	one	of	a number	of	different	firearms.	From	the	next	truck	they	were	handed	magazines for	the	type	of	weapon	they	carried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	scene	seemed	one	of	confusion,	but	the	affair	proceeded	orderly	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	thousands	of	volunteers,	but	the	militia	made	a	quick	enough	job	of arming	them	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sound	of	gunfire	cut	above	the	noise	of	the	crowds.	I	nearly	jumped	out	of my	skin,	but	every	one	else	seemed	to	ignore	it.	The	source	came	from	Wharfe Street,	running	alongside	the	station’s	main	building,	under	the	shadow	of	some warehouses.	I	walked	up	to	investigate,	and	found	myself	observing	a	militia Sergeant	as	he	showed	some	nervous	looking	volunteers	how	to	use	their	guns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Militia	personnel	were	similarly	engaged	all	over	the	area,	hurriedly	showing workers	who	had	never	held	a	gun	before	just	how	to	use	them.	Military weapons	are	designed	for	simplicity	of	use,	which	was	a	good	thing	for	the revolutionaries.	They	would	never	have	been	able	to	teach	all	the	volunteers	how to	use	them.	Only	those	who	felt	especially	unsure	of	the	weapons	were	given hasty	tuition,	and	even	then	the	militia	tutors	were	nearly	overwhelmed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	left	the	Sergeant	to	his	lesson	and	returned	to	the	station.	The	arming	of	the workers	was	still	going	on.	A	job	that	would	take	another	couple	of	hours	at least.	There	was	not	a	lot	for	me	to	do.	The	waiting	was	dull,	but	I	had	to	grit	my teeth	and	put	up	with	it.	This	was	the	worst	part,	waiting	for	the	last	stage	of	the seizure	of	power	to	take	place.	I’m	sure	many	others	felt	the	same	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet	how	would	Dutton	and	the	Terran	troops	cornered	around	Commerce	Square feel?	If	we	felt	bad	then	surely	their	feelings	were	a	thousand-fold	greater	as	they waited	to	fight	their	last	stand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IN	the	late	afternoon,	with	the	hot	sun	overhead,	that	last	stand	finally	arrived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jeeps	roared	along	the	streets	towards	the	government	buildings,	passing	the dead	structures	of	Greyermede’s	financial	institutions.	Behind	the	jeeps	marched</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a>the	Red	Guard	and	the	militia,	their	numbers	swollen	by	the	thousands	of volunteers	from	the	city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	deep-throated	roar	of	the	military	vehicles	was	drowned	out	in	the	cry	of that	great	mass	of	people.	The	streets	echoed	to	the	sounds	of	the	Internationale, sang	with	great	emotion.	At	last	Greyermede	belonged	to	the	workers.	This	last confrontation	seemingly	won	already. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	the	hindmost	jeep	leading	the	revolutionary	army,	I	smiled	as	I	watched	a torrent	of	humanity	pour	through	the	streets.	Looking	around	I	saw	other journalists.	Camera	crews	raced	alongside	the	road,	trying	to	keep	pace	with	the teeming	masses.	I	waved	and	smiled	as	we	drove	by. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fumbling	with	a	camera	I	borrowed	from	Chris,	I	checked	the	memory	card	and snapped	away.	Up	ahead,	Amar	Konate,	leading	the	assault,	sat	in	the	first	jeep, wondering	where	the	Terrans	were.	They	hadn’t	shown	themselves	for	some time.	The	Law	Courts	went	by.	Abandoned	and	forlorn.	The	fortifications	left	in place	but	the	soldiers	and	police	had	long	since	departed.	The	confident	masses surged	down	the	street,	reaching	the	end	they	turned	the	corner	into	Hawthorne Lane,	under	the	shadow	of	the	great	glass	buildings	that	so	dominated	the	city skyline. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	thrashing	sound	caught	my	attention.	I	looked	about	for	the	source	of	the noise,	but	could	see	nothing.	Then	someone	grabbed	my	arm	and	pointed towards	the	sky.	I	looked	up	and	saw	a	dot	in	the	air,	a	bright	light	flashing	from it.	The	dot	quickly	resolved	into	a	police	helicopter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Flying	low	it	soared	down	the	street.	I	pointed	my	camera	at	the	flying	machine and	adjusted	the	zoom.	On	either	side	of	the	airborne	monster	great	bulbous radar	domes	were	bolted	in	place.	Its	white	skin	gleamed	in	the	sunlight	as	it headed	forward	with	determined	purpose,	the	visored	visage	of	the	pilot	staring ahead	grimly	through	the	tinted	windshield.	The	door	on	its	side	had	been	slid back.	Strapped	to	a	safety	harness	sat	a	Terran	soldier	adorned	in	a	black	flight-suit,	over	which	he	wore	green-mottled	battle-armour.	His	head	was	hidden	in	an eerily	insectile	flight-helmet,	cables	leading	from	the	visor	to	the	ugly	form	of	a high-powered	assault	rifle	crudely	bolted	onto	the	helicopter’s	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pressed	the	shutter,	but	the	viewfinder	flashed	the	message,	‘New	Card’.	I lowered	the	camera	and	struggled	to	replace	the	old	memory	card.	The	new	one</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a>slotted	into	place,	enough	memory	for	another	thirty-six	frames.	I	raised	the camera	for	the	shot,	but	at	that	moment	the	driver’s	head	exploded.	The	sound	of the	shot	followed	in	the	bullet’s	wake	as	the	jeep	spun	out	of	control	and	crashed to	a	halt	on	the	roadside,	its	engine	still	revving	madly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	revolutionaries	scattered	as	the	soldier	fired	again.	The	bullet	smashed	a small	crater	in	the	tarmac	and	whined	into	space.	The	helicopter	came	closer, weeving	to	avoid	the	revolutionaries’	counter-fire.	The	soldier	fired	again,	his shots	coming	in	random	succession.	Several	more	people	were	killed	as	the revolutionaries	took	cover. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bullets	bounced	harmlessly	off	the	helicopter’s	belly.	Greyermede	police helicopters	were	often	used	in	riot-control	and	possessed	armoured	undersides. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	those	with	higher-velocity	weapons,	the	pilot’s	skilful	manoeuvring	defeated their	often	wild	shooting.	The	noise	of	the	gunfire	went	on	for	some	time;	the revolutionaries	pinned	down	by	that	gleaming	angel	of	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shards	of	glass	rained	down	onto	the	road,	followed	by	an	office	chair.	Guns opened	fire	in	a	hideous	roar.	Bullets	peppered	the	helicopter’s	body	and	the gunman	writhed	as	bullets	tore	through	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	smoke	pouring	from	its	engine	cowling	and	the	body	of	the	Terran dangling	lifelessly	from	his	safety	harness,	the	helicopter	veered	away	from	the street	at	a	steep	angle.	Unsteadily	its	injured	pilot	fought	for	control	as	it descended	from	the	zenith	of	its	arc,	only	to	crash	through	the	glass	facade	of	a high	office	block.	A	great	ball	of	flame	erupted	from	the	building	as	the chopper’s	fuel	ignited,	scattering	glass	and	debris	over	the	road.	The	gutted frame	of	the	ruined	helicopter	remained	embedded	in	the	steel	and	glass structure,	hanging	like	the	desiccated	remains	of	some	obscene	insect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several	militiamen	smiled	coolly	from	second	floor	windows	as	the revolutionaries	crawled	out	of	whatever	cover	they	had	found.	The	way	was clear.	But	the	Terrans	had	several	more	helicopters	at	their	disposal.	Gunships too.	Where	were	they? </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	advance	got	under	way	once	more.	I	followed,	on	foot	this	time,	as	the revolutionaries	turned	into	Haven	Road	and	advanced	on	Commerce	Square. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Down	the	pleasant,	tree-lined	boulevard,	the	entrance	to	the	square	was	visible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barricades	blocked	the	road	and	the	guns	of	Terran	troops	flashed	as	they	opened</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a>fire	on	the	advancing	army. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	jeeps	sped	forward	ahead	of	the	militia	and	Red	Guard.	Mounted	machine guns	burst	into	life	and	the	barricades	were	riddled	with	a	deadly	fire.	Spouts	of dust	and	smoke	erupted	in	the	air	as	the	bullets	blasted	into	stone	and	concrete. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several	Terrans	fell	as	the	rest	fled.	Then	an	anti-tank	rocket	blasted	a	great	hole in	the	defences	and	before	the	dust	and	smoke	could	settle	the	jeeps	raced forward	to	penetrate	Commerce	Square. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	revolutionary	masses	surged	triumphantly	through	the	breech	in	the	Terran defences.	A	flood	of	humanity	swept	past,	pushing	back	everything	in	its	path. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	great	flow	was	no	place	for	me.	I	took	cover	in	the	shade	of	a	bullet-scarred tree	as	shots	continued	to	be	exchanged.	For	ten	minutes	that	great	ocean	of revolutionary	fervour	stormed	by.	At	last	it	had	cleared	enough	for	me	to	follow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	square	was	a	battleground.	The	revolutionaries	were	beset	by	gunfire	from the	fortified	structures	of	Colony	House	and	the	adjacent	Board	of	Colonial Affairs.	Windows	not	already	put	through	by	Terran	soldiers	shattered	in	the	lead storm.	From	sandbagged	positions	soldiers	and	police	unleashed	a	deadly	fire	on the	revolutionaries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	white	vapour	trail	appeared	in	the	air	above	my	hiding	place	as	a	rocket blasted	the	fortified	entrance	to	Colony	House.	Another	explosion	rolled	over	the square	as	a	machine	gun	nest	was	destroyed,	its	luckless	crew	thrown	through the	air	like	broken	dolls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guns	fell	silent.	The	crackling	of	flames	and	the	moans	of	the	injured suddenly	audible.	A	great	cry	broke	from	the	revolutionary	ranks.	Low	at	first,	it built	up	in	intensity	until	it	was	a	dreadful	roar.	Breaking	cover,	the	tide	of humanity	surged	forward,	guns	firing	once	more,	as	they	surrounded	the government	buildings	and	began	to	blast	their	way	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Colony	House	seemed	to	swallow	the	Red	Guard	and	militia,	a	seemingly impossible	number	penetrated	the	buildings	as	the	defence	faltered.	The	shooting reduced	in	intensity	until	at	last	only	occasional	shots	broke	the	deathly	silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	inside	the	building	battle-stained	figures	emerged,	their	hands	held	high	in surrender.	The	Terran	troops	and	colonial	police	had	at	last	given	up	their hopeless	defence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	revolutionary	army	waited	outside	the	ruined	building	for	fifteen	minutes</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>while	the	government	buildings	were	cleared.	The	prisoners	were	rounded	up	on the	edge	of	the	square	and	then	left.	To	my	astonishment,	and	certainly	theirs’, the	revolutionaries	no	longer	gave	them	heed.	The	defeated	defenders	were	left to	slink	away	or	remain	as	they	saw	fit.	It	was	for	Dutton	and	his	government cronies	that	the	armed	citizens	of	Greyermede	waited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	the	smoke-filled	gloom	of	its	upper	floor,	two	Red	Guard	appeared	at	the balcony.	They	draped	a	great	piece	of	cloth	over	the	parapet.	Flapping	in	the breeze	the	flag	of	the	Revolution,	the	Red	Fist,	at	last	hung	over	Commerce Square. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Smoke-blackened,	looking	weary,	but	smiling	triumphantly,	Amar	Konate appeared	at	the	balcony,	waving	to	the	crowds.	Behind	him	appeared	the	smaller, older	figure	of	Karl	Minsky.	Looking	down	at	the	crowds	a	moment,	he	turned his	gaze	on	the	smoking	buildings	that	once	housed	the	old	colonial	state.	A smile	stole	across	his	face	as	he	raised	his	arms	to	beckon	for	attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	seems	the	Rats	have	fled!	But	no	matter.	Greyermede	is	ours.	The	Red	Fist	of the	Revolution	is	poised	to	crush	the	capitalist	tyrant	forever!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	crowds	threw	their	arms	in	the	air	and	cheered.	Minsky	declared Greyermede	to	be	history’s	first	worker’s	planet.	The	cheering	and	cries	of	joy rocked	Commerce	Square	to	its	very	foundations	as	the	masses	celebrated	their victory.	Around	me	grown	men	burst	into	tears	of	joy;	rough	workmen,	their bodies	ruined	by	a	lifetime	toiling	in	the	colony’s	harsh	factories	wept	and hugged	each	other	like	brothers	or	even	lovers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	grimy	looking	militiaman	offered	me	a	bottle	of	whiskey	with	a	grin	on	his tired	looking	face.	I	took	the	bottle	and	swallowed	a	mouthful	of	the	bitter	fluid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	laughed	in	pure	joy	as	I	returned	it	and	then	downed	a	great	gulp himself.	Hope,	joy,	great	confidence	crackled	through	the	thousands	gathered	in the	square.	The	whole	city,	the	whole	planet,	was	in	celebration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">GREYERMEDE	belonged	to	the	workers	now.	It	was	no	longer	a	world	for	the rich	and	powerful	plutocrat.	It	was	a	world	for	the	person	in	the	street;	old	Joe Bloggs	Nobody.	But	where	in	all	this	turbulent	excitement	was	the	deposed Governor	Dutton? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	14</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	pleasant	breeze	shifted	over	the	spaceport	that	day,	bringing	with	it	the	sharp scent	of	the	seas	beyond	the	port’s	distant	perimeter,”	Simon	Niczyperowicz	told me	at	a	quiet	pub	one	afternoon	in	downtown	Mars	Field.	“I’m	sure	everyone was	grateful	for	the	breeze	on	such	a	hot	day,	but	it	was	little	consolation	to	the crowds	gathered	from	all	over	the	region. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	an	air-traffic	controller	at	Copernicus	Spaceport.	Refugees	from	all	over the	continent	were	waiting	for	the	shuttles	to	take	them	to	liners	in	orbit	around Greyermede.	Businessmen,	politicians,	bureaucrats	in	the	state	ministries,	trade union	bosses,	all	the	stalwarts	of	the	old	regime,	and	many	of	their	supporters huddled	together	in	the	departure	lounges,	waiting	to	be	processed	and transported	to	the	distant	shuttles	five	miles	on	the	other	side	of	the	port. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	incoming	traffic	had	stopped	by	now.	We	knew	that	Firsthaven	was	falling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nobody	else	could	reach	Copernicus.	The	air	was	laden	with	a	dull	fear.	Could all	these	refugees	be	evacuated	before	the	Reds	arrived?	Rumour	said	that revolutionary	forces	were	little	more	than	an	hour	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Standing	on	an	outbuilding	beneath	the	airport’s	control	tower,	I	could	see much	of	Copernicus	spread	out	below.	Behind	me,	the	runways	and	hangars were	hidden	behind	the	bulk	of	the	tower,	but	before	me	I	could	see	the	squat buildings	of	the	rail	and	coach	terminus.	Here	more	refugees	were	billeted	while the	military	processed	their	details.	To	my	right	the	huge	hotels	stood	empty	and lifeless.	To	my	left,	down	a	great	stretch	of	roadway,	warehouses,	and	a	variety of	other	buildings,	I	could	see	the	shuttle	bays.	The	shuttles	themselves	gleamed white	in	the	sun,	shimmering	slightly	in	the	haze.	A	microwave	dish	spun	slowly on	the	roof	of	the	Launch	Control	building,	a	dark	silhouette	in	the	distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	looked	across	at	the	car-park.	On	the	fifth	story,	slightly	above	my	position,	a tired-looking	militiaman	leant	on	the	parapet.	A	cigarette	dangled	from	his mouth	as	he	looked	down	at	the	ground,	lost	in	his	dejected	thoughts.	A	gunship flew	overhead,	its	guns	bristling	with	menace.	A	distant	roar	signalled	the	rise	of one	of	the	shuttles,	taking	its	cargo	into	reluctant	exile	as	its	mighty	engines struggled	against	Greyermede’s	gravitational	pull. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Terran	troops	had	deployed	their	forces	to	defend	the	whole	port.	Hoping</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a>to	hold	off	the	Reds	until	the	last	of	the	refugees	was	safely	in	orbit.	Jeeps patrolled	most	of	the	perimeter,	but	the	majority	of	their	forces	were concentrated	on	the	main	entrance.	The	car	park	was	a	fortress	since	it overlooked	the	likeliest	point	of	attack.	The	nearer	hotels	held	nervous	troops and	loyal	militia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Below	me	jeeps	hurried	along	the	spaceport’s	road	network.	Troops	were drilled	mercilessly	or	hurriedly	transported	military	equipment	to	bolster	the defences.	Coaches	transported	frightened	refugees	to	the	distant	shuttles	and ultimately	exile.	From	confident	order,	Greyermede’s	elite	had	fallen	into anarchy	and	chaos. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“AS	I	contemplated	the	hive	of	activity	below	me	a	distant	shrieking	noise	broke over	the	sounds	of	the	chaos.	It	quickly	grew	louder.	I	looked	up,	studying	the skies.	The	noise	didn’t	sound	like	any	engine	I’d	ever	heard	before.	The	car	park across	from	where	I	stood	suddenly	shuddered	as	a	great	boom	rolled	across	the port.	Smoke	and	broken	concrete	erupted	over	the	grounds	as	an	explosion ripped	through	its	structure;	the	shockwaves	threw	me	to	the	floor	even	at	that distance.	The	hideous	wailing	of	an	injured	man	emerged	from	the	wreckage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Terran	troops	burst	into	a	frenzy	of	activity.	Another	shrieking	wail	broke through	the	skies.	A	truck	roared	around	the	corner	of	a	warehouse	and	suddenly erupted	in	flames,	the	blast	flipping	it	onto	its	side.	The	ramp	leading	into	the	car park	suffered	a	direct	hit	and	collapsed,	crushing	a	jeep	and	several	soldiers under	shattered	concrete.	More	shells	landed	in	the	port.	The	explosions	shook the	earth	and	the	structures	built	upon	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sirens	whined	and	the	troops	ran	to	and	fro.	I	fled	back	into	the	control	tower, stumbling	as	more	explosions	rocked	the	building.	‘The	Reds	are	coming!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">someone	shouted	as	I	raced	up	the	steps,	taking	them	in	twos	and	threes,	towards the	control	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Crashing	through	the	doors,	I	found	the	control	room	in	turmoil.	What	civilian staff	who	hadn’t	fled	still	manned	their	stations,	operating	radar	terminals	and communications	equipment.	Officers	and	soldiers	barked	orders,	bustling	each other	to	organise	the	resistance.	The	commander	gazed	out	across	the	compound; his	eyes	fixed	on	the	roads	approaching	Copernicus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Following	his	gaze,	I	watched	as	a	great	convoy	steadily	progressed	towards</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a>Copernicus.	Jeeps,	trucks,	troop	carriers,	even	a	coach	and	several	cars,	all	laden with	revolutionary	workers	and	militia.	Beyond	them,	in	the	far	distance,	flashes of	light	briefly	flared	as	militia	artillery	continued	to	bombard	the	defences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Little	could	be	heard	of	the	battle	in	that	confused	control	room,	but	the	distant roar	of	the	cannon	and	the	muffled	chattering	of	small-arms	as	the	two	sides fought	for	control	of	the	port’s	entrances.	I	stood	transfixed,	ignored	amidst	the chaos	of	shouting,	worried	people.	Held	in	awe	by	the	sight	of	the	proletariat	on the	march	I	walked	towards	the	tinted	windows	and	gazed	at	the	battle	raging below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“From	makeshift	positions	of	defence,	troops	blasted	the	revolutionaries	with heavy	machine	guns	and	assault	rifles.	Soldiers	fell	as	bullets	found	their	mark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blood	drenched	the	roads	and	the	pavements.	A	jeep	sped	up	to	bolster	the defending	infantry.	A	mounted	machine-gun	roaring	distantly.	A	hail	of	lead from	some	unseen	assassin	rattled	the	jeep,	its	occupants	collapsing	as	the bullets	penetrated	light	battle-armour.	A	squad	of	soldiers	ran	towards	fresh positions,	desperately	seeking	cover	as	a	trail	of	dusty	explosions	ripped	across the	tarmac	in	front	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Three	dots	appeared	low	in	the	horizon	to	the	south-west.	I	watched	them	in	an almost	hypnotic	trance	as	they	silently	flew	closer.	In	minutes	they	resolved	into three	sleek	metallic	darts	-	the	graceful	lines	of	Militia	Air	Corps	atmospheric fighters.	Light	flared	under	the	wings	of	the	lead	craft	and	two	vapour	trails	shot forth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Panic	finally	hit	me.	Almost	hysterical	with	terror	I	ran	towards	the	door	and wrenched	them	open.	Stumbling	in	my	haste,	I	raced	down	the	stairs.	Halfway down,	the	building	suddenly	filled	with	bright	light	and	heat.	Some	force	picked me	up	as	a	terrible	bang	reverberated	through	the	control	tower	and	I	was	thrown down	the	stairs.	I	hit	the	bottom	hard	and	blacked	out,	I	didn’t	remember anything	else	for	some	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	15</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“WHEN	I	woke,	the	smell	of	burning	was	thick.	Smoke	filled	my	throat	and	my eyes	watered	so	I	couldn’t	see	clearly.	Fire	crackled	from	above	me	and	I guessed	that	the	control	room	had	been	gutted	in	the	explosion.	I	was	lucky	to	be alive,	but	I	ached	all	over	and	my	head	was	bleeding.	Vaguely	I	wondered	if	the fighting	was	over,	but	then	an	explosion	rocked	the	building	and	I	knew	it wasn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Groggy	from	the	fall,	I	stumbled	down	the	stairs,	almost	falling	all	the	way down	but	I	managed	to	grab	the	handrail.	Feeling	numb	with	shock	I	limped down	the	stairs	and	slipped	out	of	a	maintenance	access.	Leaning	against	the wall,	gasping	for	breath	to	clear	my	lungs	of	smoke	I	saw	that	the	fighting	had spread	to	the	rest	of	the	compound.	The	grounds	below	the	control	tower	were	a battlefield. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everywhere	I	looked	there	were	running	and	fighting	figures.	Many	uniformed Terran	troops,	laden	with	all	their	hi-tech	battle-garb,	many	more	in	civilian clothes;	grey	suits,	work	clothes,	jeans	and	casual	jackets.	Still	more	in	militia uniforms,	impossible	to	tell	on	whose	side	they	were	on	if	it	wasn’t	for	the	red bands	of	cloth	adorning	their	arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	thing	was	certain	in	this	confusion	of	warring	humanity,	only	the	victors could	be	certain	as	the	revolutionary	tide	swept	the	Terrans	before	them.	The soldiers	ran,	pushed	back	towards	the	East	Side	of	the	port. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Through	this	battlefield	I	crawled,	desperately	hunting	for	safety.	My	ears	were assaulted	by	a	dreadful	symphony	of	chattering	gunfire,	the	dull	roar	of explosions,	and	the	screaming	of	the	injured	and	the	dying.	Bullets	whined through	the	air	as	they	bounced	off	stone	or	metal.	From	the	air	came	the	distant thrashing	of	rotor	blades	as	gunships	fought	to	stem	the	flow	of	humanity overwhelming	their	comrades	on	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At	last	I	reached	the	warehouses	across	from	the	control	tower,	to	the	east	of	the ruined	car-park.	A	squad	of	soldiers	ran	round	the	corner	of	the	building,	passing my	cowering	form.	Their	expressions	were	a	mixture	of	fear	and	grim determination.	Their	equipment	rattling	in	time	to	heavy	footfalls.	For	some reason	they	ignored	me.	Perhaps	they	had	seen	I	was	unarmed	and	thus	no	threat. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a>“Gunfire	chattered	and	several	of	the	soldiers	fell	to	the	tarmac,	one	screamed hideously	as	blood	poured	from	a	wound	in	his	leg.	Revolutionaries	stormed through	the	gaps	between	the	warehouses	and	maintenance	sheds.	Battle	raged around	me	once	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	gunship	roared	over	head.	The	downdraft	from	its	blades	whipped	up	the	dust and	smoke	in	terrible	choking	eddies.	Its	guns	roared,	finding	targets	below.	In the	confusion	the	aerial	beast	killed	Terrans	as	much	as	revolutionaries.	It	flew off	towards	the	gates,	its	sleek	shell	glistening	darkly	in	the	sunlight.	Suddenly	it flared	with	a	different	light.	Something	destructive	impacted	and	the	sleek	death-machine	crashed	to	the	ground	in	flames. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“From	where	I	lay,	panting	for	breath	and	bitterly	scared,	I	could	see	the runways	beyond	the	control	tower.	More	gunships	blazed	on	the	ground.	Several airliners	also	were	on	fire,	their	broken	bodies	jamming	the	runways.	I	crawled down	the	road	between	the	warehouses.	Glad	to	be	clear	of	the	fighting	for	that moment,	but	I	knew	it	could	catch	up	at	any	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	next	road	beckoned	and	I	leaned	against	the	warehouse	wall	as	I	took	in	the scene.	The	vast	tarmac	plain,	criss-crossed	with	roads	and	low	buildings stretched	out	before	me	once	more.	Fighting	figures	filled	that	plain	as	the Terrans	were	swept	up.	Behind	that	raging	battlefront	the	revolutionaries	fought to	mop	up	pockets	of	Terran	resistance,	while	the	rest	battled	to	win	ground.	The Terrans	fought	dearly	for	every	metre.	Fighting	even	more	viciously	as	they became	ever	more	hard	pressed.	I	was	too	frightened	to	wonder	why	they	didn’t just	flee	or	surrender	instead	of	fighting	on,	allowing	the	casualties	to	increase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	watched	as	a	gunship	soared	through	the	skies,	black	smoke	trailing	from	its engine,	its	guns	still	blasting	at	the	fighting	figures	below.	Fire	engulfed	the insectoid	killing	machine	as	it	exploded;	no	longer	a	sinister	angel	of	death,	it streaked	across	the	sky	like	a	blazing	comet,	its	rotors	still	impotently	thrashing at	air	that	would	no	longer	support	its	bulk.	The	gunship	arced	into	the impounded	imports	building	where	it	ended	its	mechanical	life	in	a	further brilliant	explosion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	position	by	that	wall	was	horribly	exposed.	Thankfully,	better	cover	lay	just a	few	feet	away.	With	a	quick,	frightened	glance	around,	I	hobbled	to	the	next warehouse	and	hid	myself	behind	a	number	of	crates	that	should	have	been stored	in	the	building	itself.	Fortunately	for	me	they	hadn’t	been	moved	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a>time	the	attack	came.	From	this	cover	I	cautiously	looked	out	across	the	battle-scarred	tarmac. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fifty	metres	away	the	main	customs	offices	stood:	deserted	apart	from	some refugees	billeted	there	earlier.	In	bewilderment,	I	watched	as	soldiers	ceased their	bitterly	fought	retreat	and	began	to	form	defensive	positions	around	the building.	A	truck	appeared	round	the	corner,	parking	with	its	cabin	pointing	east, its	engine	still	revving	impatiently.	It	seemed	that	the	refugees	were	to	be evacuated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Appearing	low	in	the	horizon,	five	dots	rapidly	flew	towards	the	soldiers.	They quickly	became	visible	as	helicopters,	four	gunships	and	one	police	transport. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	gunships	did	not	fire,	and	this	seemed	to	add	to	the	urgency	of	their	flight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Great	clouds	of	chaff	scattered	through	the	air	in	a	defence	against	anti-aircraft weapons,	and	I	felt	sure	their	ECM11	systems	would	be	blaring	loudly	on	every electro-magnetic	frequency	used	by	military	weaponry.	The	police	helicopter hovered	above	the	road	and	quickly	touched	down.	The	gunships	hovered	a	little distance	away,	their	weapons	laying	down	covering	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	the	police	helicopter	figures	began	to	emerge.	I	recognised	the	hunched figure	of	ex-Governor	Dutton,	behind	him	toiled	Dmitri	Korolev,	Micheal Hartmann	and	several	more	of	the	deposed	executive.	A	blue-bereted	officer	met them	and	hastily	saluted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Agents	in	civilian	clothes	gathered	around	to	protect	the	deposed	government as	a	distant	crash	came	from	the	customs	building.	Struggling	against	a	cordon of	troops,	the	refugees	fought	to	leave	the	planet.	At	last	they	overpowered	the soldiers	and	surged	towards	the	waiting	vehicle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dutton	and	his	colleagues	were	hastily	escorted	to	the	waiting	vehicle, surrounded	by	troops	and	CIS	agents.	As	they	were	assisted	into	the	truck	a	be-suited	agent	raised	a	machine	pistol	and	opened	fire	on	the	refugees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	truck	burst	into	life	and	rumbled	down	the	tarmac,	urgently	heading towards	the	shuttle	bays.	Behind	it	the	soldiers	and	the	CIS	agents	continued	to fight	as	the	revolutionaries	surged	forward.	Holding	off	the	tide	until	the	truck was	clear.	At	last	only	three	remained;	guns	empty	they	threw	down	their weapons	and	raised	their	hands	as	revolutionaries	overwhelmed	the	last resistance. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>“Armed	jeeps	hurried	after	the	truck	in	a	desperate	race	to	prevent	the	old regime’s	escape.	The	vehicles	disappeared	in	the	distance.	Only	the	distant sound	of	gunshots	brought	news	of	the	race,	and	that	was	inconclusive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Minutes	later,	as	a	calm	silence	descended	over	Copernicus,	a	bright	light	flared beneath	one	of	the	shuttles.	Mists	of	freezing	cold	air	dispersed	from	its	shell	as it	pushed	its	way	from	the	surface.	Slowly	it	gained	altitude,	the	glare	of	its motors	hiding	the	gleaming	skin	of	the	shuttle	so	that	only	a	dart	of	bright	flame could	be	seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	shuttle	roared	into	the	sky,	shooting	spaceward.	Aboard	it	fled	the	last colonial	government	of	Greyermede.	On	the	very	wings	of	the	revolutionary storm	they	fled	into	exile,	finally	safe	from	the	reach	of	the	avenging	proletariat. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	16</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">BY	nightfall	Greyermede	was	wholly	in	the	hands	of	the	working	class.	The	last pockets	of	Terran	and	Colonial	resistance	surrendered	after	the	news	of	Dutton’s flight	spread	across	the	world.	By	the	morning	of	the	21st,	it	was	all	over.	Peace descended	on	the	troubled	colony.	The	sun	rose	upon	a	world	looking	into	the future	with	hope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	next	few	days	the	final	clearing	up	was	performed.	Terran	troops	were imprisoned	until	arrangements	could	be	made	for	their	deportation.	The	militia units	that	remained	loyal	to	the	old	regime	were	disarmed	and	soon	released.	As this	was	going	on,	other	Red	Guard	and	militia	units	rounded	up	the	old government	figures	that	failed	to	escape.	Not	all	passed	without	incident. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thomas	Franklin,	the	Terran	Ambassador	was	found	hanging	from	the	gates	of his	official	country	residence.	Simon	McCrowley,	the	planet’s	now	ex-Chief	of Police	and	Minister	for	Public	Order,	was	shot	dead	in	counter-fire	as	his bodyguards	opened	fire	on	the	militia	sent	to	arrest	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Other	members	of	the	old	elite	were	killed	also.	But	in	the	main	they	were	taken into	custody	with	little	mishap.	The	killings	were	considered	tragic	but	nobody lost	any	sleep	over	the	deaths.	Given	half	the	chance	their	retribution	against	the Revolution	would	have	been	terrible.	Besides,	there	was	much	else	for	the revolutionaries	to	consider. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	last	Firsthaven	took	its	place	alongside	its	revolutionary	comrades.	From	its workers’	committees	and	party	organisations	that	had	so	long	been	forced	to operate	in	the	shadows,	a	city	council	was	elected.	Both	Amar	Konate	and	James O’Brien	were	elected	to	this	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Terrans	were	defeated.	Greyermede	had	finally	achieved	independence, though	not	in	the	form	envisaged	by	the	old	Opposition	Coalition:	exploitation and	poverty	had	no	place	in	Greyermede’s	future.	This	future	looked	bright,	but the	revolutionaries	had	forgotten	the	terrorist	organisations	that	had	sprung	up from	the	horror	of	‘Black	October’.	Not	powerful	enough	to	be	a	serious	threat to	the	revolutionaries,	they	nevertheless	made	their	presence	known	in	a	number of	bombings	and	assassinations.	Despite	their	lack	of	power,	the	terrorists managed	to	strike	a	terrible	blow	to	the	Revolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a>On	the	27th	December	2238	Karl	Minsky	was	gunned	down	in	a	Firsthaven street.	Black	October	later	claimed	responsibility. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Minsky	had	been	on	a	walkabout	tour	of	the	city.	Surrounded	by	Red	Guards	he hadn’t	wanted	but	was	forced	to	tolerate	by	his	party	comrades,	he	undertook	a tour	of	the	city.	Security	was	made	nonsensical	by	the	thousands	of	people	eager to	see	him.	Minsky	hadn’t	helped	by	his	own	eagerness	to	mingle	with	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps	he	could	be	forgiven	this.	With	the	Terrans	gone	there	seemed	to	be	no danger,	only	the	great	task	of	reconstruction.	But	Black	October	struck	from	the Opposition	Coalition’s	grave	and	robbed	the	Revolution	of	one	of	its	most popular	figures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	NEW	DAWN</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	17</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">MANY	brave	men	and	women	gave	their	lives	so	that	the	Revolution	could	live. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	people	grieved	at	their	passing,	but	took	consolation	from	the	fact	that	they were	free.	That	those	who	perished	sacrificed	their	lives	for	a	better	future.	Yet, there	was	no	such	consolation	for	Minsky’s	death,	gunned	down,	as	he	was,	by enemies	within. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hurt	by	this	needless	loss,	the	colony	mourned.	It	was	a	bitter	reminder	that	all was	not	yet	safe.	Greyermede	was	won,	but	the	Revolution	was	far	from	secure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	surrounded	by	enemies	and	was	forced	to	ponder	the	reactions	of	the	rest of	the	galaxy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	anything	else,	the	Revolution	needed	to	bury	those	who	fell	to	give	it	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	streets	of	Firsthaven	swelled	with	people	once	more.	Thousands	upon thousands	turned	out	to	say	their	last	farewells	to	the	fallen.	In	silence,	they marched	towards	Commerce	Square,	their	sombre	faces	written	with	anguish and	grief.	Leading	this	great	funeral	procession	was	Minsky	himself.	Laid	to	rest in	a	red	casket,	the	coffin	draped	in	the	flag	of	the	Revolution.	Members	of	the party	Central	Committee	and	the	Firsthaven	Council	bore	Minsky	towards	his final	resting-place.	Behind	them	marched	a	detachment	of	Red	Guard	and militia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Offworld	camera	crews	followed	the	march.	Never	the	subtlest	of	professions, the	media	nevertheless	kept	to	the	background	for	this	mass	outpouring	of	grief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	procession	swarmed	into	Haven	Street,	at	last	heading	for	Commerce Square	-	a	vastly	different	place	to	what	it	had	been	little	more	than	a	week	ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	funeral	march	passed	into	the	square,	thousands	more	gathered	to	line	the outskirts.	Discreetly	placed	camera	crews	calmly	recorded	the	funeral.	The	great statue	that	once	dominated	the	square	was	gone,	a	great	pit	excavated	in	its place.	Already	hundreds	of	red	coffins	lined	its	bottom,	waiting	to	take	their	last comrade	into	their	embrace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carefully	the	coffin	bearers	descended	into	the	pit	and	there	they	placed	Karl Minsky	finally	to	rest	amongst	his	comrades.	The	great	procession	that	marched behind	him	gathered	around	the	grave	in	a	teeming	circle	of	weeping	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a>The	leaders	of	the	Revolution	stood	before	the	mass	grave,	their	gaunt	faces turned	towards	the	crowd.	Amar	Konate	looked	long	at	the	gathered	people, tears	streaming	down	his	face	as	he	prepared	to	speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Karl	Minsky	was	a	revolutionary	all	his	adult	life!”	he	began,	his	voice	cracked with	emotion.	“Never	would	he	rest	until	Greyermede	was	free,	until	the proletariat	ruled	this	world.	Karl	was	taken	from	us	too	soon,	before	he	could	see the	great	things	the	proletariat	will	achieve.	But	he	can	at	last	rest	in	peace.	The task	to	which	he	dedicated	his	life	has	at	last	been	realised,	for	now	the proletariat	rules	Greyermede.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	our	brave	comrades	lie	here,	at	rest	but	not	forgotten.	Let	their	bones	and the	memory	of	their	bravery	be	the	foundation	from	which	our	hope	will	flourish into	a	great	future!”	James	O’Brien	cried.	“Our	memorial	to	them	will	be	the new	society	we	have	started	to	build.	They	have	bequeathed	socialism	to	us,	let us	make	sure	they	didn’t	die	in	vain!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Speaker	after	speaker	addressed	the	crowd.	At	last,	Amar	Konate	spoke	up	once more.	“Let	us	remember	those	to	whom	we	say	goodbye.	We	owe	them	so much…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tears	staining	his	face,	his	voice	unsteady,	Amar	Konate	began	to	read	out	a	list of	names.	All	those	interred	in	the	grave.	Hundreds	of	names,	a	long	list	of	the fallen	but	mercifully	shorter	than	it	might	have	been.	The	crowds	wept	as	the names	were	read	out.	Wails	and	grief-ridden	sobs	erupting	as	family	and	friends heard	particular	names.	In	front	of	me	the	tears	streamed	down	the	rough	face	of an	old	worker,	heedless	of	who	saw	them	as	he	cried	out	his	grief.	I	looked	away, uncomfortable,	feeling	like	a	cold	intruder	at	that	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	time	for	words	was	over.	The	square	was	quiet	but	for	the	sobs	of	the	living. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowly	the	mourners	filed	up	to	the	grave	to	throw	in	a	handful	of	earth	onto	the coffins	below.	Flowers,	both	single,	and	in	bundles	were	thrown	into	the	grave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	wreaths.	Wreaths	were	for	the	dead;	and	while	those	in	the	grave	had	passed away,	they	still	lived	in	the	memories	of	those	remaining,	and	in	what	would	be built	in	the	revolutionary	aftermath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	what	seemed	an	age,	the	last	of	the	mourners	returned	to	the	future	that now	held	far	greater	promise	than	it	did	under	old	Greyermede. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	great	outpouring	of	emotion	was	done.	A	funeral	without	priests.	Without</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a>the	false,	empty	consolation	of	religion.	Greyermede	no	longer	needed	religion, that	prison	of	the	freethinking	mind.	It	was	dissolved	with	the	rest	of	the	chains tying	the	workers	to	capitalism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind	the	departing	mourners,	workers	began	to	shovel	earth	into	the	grave, covering	their	lost	ones	forever,	their	faces	sad	but	the	tears	now	gone.	The emotion	had	got	to	me.	I	had	tried	to	be	the	cold,	passive	witness,	but	the Revolution	got	under	my	skin.	Watching	the	funeral	made	me	realise	just	how much.	I	walked	up	to	the	lip	of	that	grave.	Stooped	to	pick	up	a	handful	of	earth and	threw	it	into	the	pit.	I	watched	in	silence	as	it	pattered	onto	the	coffins below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	days	after	the	funeral,	the	grave	was	planted	with	flowers	and	tended	as	a memorial	to	the	revolutionary	dead.	In	the	centre	of	the	garden	they	placed	a great	monument.	On	a	block	of	white	marble,	engraved	with	the	names	of	those interred,	was	placed	a	huge	clenched	fist;	the	symbol	of	the	Revolution	carved	in red	granite. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	18</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">SO	much	grief,	but	also	so	much	hope.	There	was	much	to	do	and	the revolutionaries’	minds	were	turned	from	their	loss.	Now	they	concentrated	on building	the	future	free	from	the	slavery	of	the	capitalist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	most	urgent	tasks	facing	the	Revolution	was	the	formation	of	the	first workers’	government.	For	weeks,	the	cities	and	regions	functioned	under	the guidance	of	their	elected	city	councils.	Now	it	was	time	for	these	to	be	co-ordinated	by	a	central	authority.	That	was	just	what	the	revolutionary	leaders	had been	negotiating	for	weeks,	and	now	it	was	time	to	put	it	into	practice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	last,	Greyermede	elected	its	first	government,	independent	from	Earth	finally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	it	wasn’t	the	government	dreamed	of	by	the	old	Opposition	Coalition.	It	was the	product	of	the	workers’	struggle,	crystallising	from	their	long	labours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing	in	the	entire	galaxy	could	be	more	democratic	than	this	new	proletarian government;	the	Directorate	as	they	called	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Regional	and	planetary	government	was	modelled	on	the	workers’	councils	of the	cities	and	work	places;	it	was	to	these,	which	the	new	government organisations	answered.	Delegates	were	elected	to	the	new	Directorate	from	all over	the	planet.	The	government	was	housed	in	Trafalgar	by	common	consent: that	city	was	ever	the	heart	of	the	Revolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	steering	committee	-	the	delegates	if	you	like	-	elected	the	executive.	They had	no	greater	power	than	their	comrades	did.	Their	role	was	merely	to administer	the	various	departments	necessary	to	run	the	planet,	and	to	guide	the meetings	of	the	new	body.	With	Karl	Minsky	gone,	the	Directorate	granted Howard	Kramer	the	honour	of	being	its	first	Chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Directorate	was	no	parliamentary	body,	nor	were	the	delegates parliamentarians	as	they	are	in	the	Metropolitan	Worlds.	This	was	to	be	a working	body,	fusing	the	roles	of	executive	and	assembly.	Ad	hoc	committees discussed	and	thrashed	out	specialist	matters,	but	then	put	their	findings	and proposals	to	all	the	delegates.	Once	matters	had	been	decided,	the	delegates themselves	were	involved	in	executing	these	decisions.	They	did	not	leave	it simply	to	unelected	career	bureaucrats. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a>The	old	bureaucracies	still	lingered,	of	course.	But	where	they	couldn’t	be replaced,	their	obstructionist	tendencies	were	countered	with	the	metaphorical gun	to	the	head.	Attempts	at	sabotaging	the	new	workers’	state	were	not tolerated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These	delegates	could	be	recalled	at	any	time	should	they	prove	incapable	of	the tasks	granted	to	them,	or	indeed,	if	they	attempted	to	accrue	power	in	their	own hands.	No	hidden	party	caucuses	existed	to	ratify	their	positions.	No	party mechanisms	to	protect	their	backs	should	they	offend	the	workers.	The	majority party	was	the	GCP	and	the	great	majority	of	the	workers	made	up	its	ranks,	not passively,	but	actively.	The	GCP’s	Central	Committee	was	subject	to	democratic election	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Directorate	handled	the	affairs	that	were	too	great	for	the	regional	and	city councils	to	handle.	The	communications	link	simplified	the	ties	holding	the workers’	state	together.	Authority	rested	on	these	workers’	councils,	and	these bodies	formed	the	backbone	of	workers	power,	based	upon	collective	control	of industry	and	agriculture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	these	elected	delegates,	and	members	of	the	city	councils	were	paid	no	more than	an	average	wage.	All	were	held	responsible	to	the	workers.	In	the	cities,	the workers	could	participate	in	the	decision	making	process,	and	many	did	in packed	out	meetings.	For	planetary	government,	this	involvement	had	to	be channelled	through	the	delegates	simply	because	of	the	distance	of	the government	from	most	workers.	But	this	government	body	belonged	to	the proletariat.	It	was	their	democratic	institutions	based	on	their	own	control	of industry	that	now	ruled	the	planet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	the	dictatorship	of	the	proletariat	made	flesh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	what	was	this	dictatorship?	The	opposite	of	the	dictatorship	of	the bourgeoisie,	of	the	capitalist.	It	was	society	ordered	in	the	interests	of	the	vast majority,	not	the	profits	of	a	tiny	few.	Class	society	inverted,	but	not	negated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	the	proletariat	oppressing	the	old	ruling	class.	Denying	them	their	old</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘right’	to	exploit	and	oppress	society.	It	would	go	on	until	all	the	old	social rubbish	of	capitalism	was	finally	weeded	out,	until	there	was	no	longer	any social	class,	until	such	terminology	was	meaningless.	Greyermede	had	entered the	socialist	phase,	in	transition	to	communism,	the	proletariat	no	longer	a passive	object	of	history,	but	cutting	a	new	course	to	the	future. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	19</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	new	government	supervised	the	rebuilding	of	the	colony.	Billions	of	eager hands	took	to	the	task	of	constructing	socialism.	In	the	general	euphoria	of	those hope-filled	days	the	government	issued	decree	after	decree.	Greyermede’s decades-old	death	penalty	was	abolished.	Steps	were	taken	to	improve	women’s position	in	society,	a	position	already	greatly	improved	by	the	active	role	many women	took	in	the	Revolution.	Nina	Sanchez,	Firsthaven’s	delegate	to	the Directorate,	was	placed	in	charge	of	women’s	affairs.	Promptly	abortion	was fully	legalised	after	decades	of	being	a	sensitive	issue	in	Greyermede	politics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Divorce	was	made	available	to	either	partner	on	demand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Experiments	in	education	were	carried	out,	as	the	planet’s	educational	system was	opened	up	for	all,	involving	massive	schemes	of	adult	education. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Homophobia,	sexism,	racism	were	all	old	social	ills	that	the	new	education reforms	were	intended	to	combat,	alongside	other	efforts	to	eradicate	these	forms of	social	injustice.	In	the	new	liberated	atmosphere,	thousands	of	homosexual couples	were	able	to	marry	for	the	first	time	free	of	any	fears	of	persecution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	proletariat	worked	hard	in	constructing	their	new	order.	They	had	only	just begun	the	long	task,	but	nobody	doubted	it	would	be	completed.	In	the	days following	the	election	of	the	government,	Greyermede’s	orbital	facilities	were taken	into	the	hands	of	the	workers.	The	last	elements	of	loyalty	to	the	old regime	were	returned	to	the	planet	or	deported.	At	last,	Greyermede	was	no longer	cut	off	from	the	rest	of	the	galaxy	and	messages	greeting	the	workers	of the	industrialised	worlds	were	transmitted	to	the	stars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Down	below,	on	the	now	peaceful	colony,	the	long	task	of	regenerating	the	cities began.	A	massive	house	building	programme	started	in	Trafalgar.	It	quickly spread	as	the	rest	of	the	world	followed	the	initiative.	Hospital	facilities	were greatly	expanded	and	improved,	and	made	available	to	all.	Trees	and	gardens were	planted	in	the	cities	in	an	attempt	to	beautify	their	somewhat	bland,	cold architecture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	amazement	I	looked	on	as	the	streets	of	Firsthaven	sprouted	statues	and sculptures,	forming	new	perches	for	the	doves	released	in	a	symbolic	gesture	of peace.	The	works	of	art	commissioned	by	the	council	from	young	artists	and	the art	workshops	that	sprung	up	as	workers	minds’	exploded	in	a	great	creative</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>impulse.	The	old,	sanitised	culture	of	the	deposed	ruling	class	was	absorbed	and regenerated	in	an	explosion	of	proletarian	culture.	Worker	controlled	television stations,	theatres,	papers,	publishing	houses,	cinema,	all	mushroomed	in	the wake	of	the	Revolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Greyermede	buzzed	with	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">AS	the	weeks	became	months,	the	Directorate	considered	the	likely	reactions	of the	capitalist	worlds.	On	this	issue,	the	government	was	divided.	Everybody	felt they	would	face	some	kind	of	retribution	from	the	outraged	frightened	worlds that	had	not	yet	fallen	under	the	Red	Tide,	but	what	form	that	would	take	was unclear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	GCP	argued	for	the	active	extension	of	the	Revolution,	and	assistance	to workers	beyond	Greyermede.	Others	felt	that	this	would	provoke	the	capitalist worlds	still	further,	and	that	the	colony	should	try	to	weather	the	storm	by	itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	consensus	emerged	that	they	would	face	only	some	form	of	economic	sanction and	possibly	a	blockade.	It	was	also	felt	that	soon	other	worlds	would	follow Greyermede’s	lead,	ending	the	planet’s	isolation.	Indeed,	this	was	crucial	to	the survival	of	the	Revolution,	as	the	GCP	leadership	constantly	told	the	planet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	Earth	would	attack	was	a	possibility	they	discounted.	Earth	was	too	far away.	The	Revolution	would	have	triggered	too	much	unrest,	more	revolts	on other	Terran-dominated	worlds.	In	other	words,	Earth	would	be	too	over-stretched	to	launch	an	attack	over	such	a	distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	Revolution	debated	the	issue,	it	concentrated	on	building	socialism.	After all,	events	on	the	distant	Metropolitan	Worlds	were	beyond	their	control.	They could	only	wait	and	see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	to	the	capitalist	worlds:	had	the	Directorate	possessed	access	to	the Metropolitan	Worlds’	media	they	would	have	gained	some	insight	into	the	minds of	their	enemies,	but	that	was	two	weeks	away…</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	METROPOLITAN	WORLDS</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	20</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A	dark,	angry	sky.	Beneath	it	stretches	a	twisted	barren	plain.	Ravaged	by	war, the	buildings	stand	in	defiance	of	the	destructive	forces	wreaked	upon	them.	No more	than	gutted	shells,	their	windows	and	doors	are	smashed,	girders	and supports	reaching	into	the	sky	like	blackened	skeletons.	Here	and	there	stand	a few	charred	trees,	little	more	than	stumps.	The	plain	disappears	into	the	horizon, mud	and	rubble	extending	in	all	directions,	and	over	all	blows	a	cold,	hard	wind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	distance,	figures	appear,	grey	and	splattered	in	mud.	Hardly	visible	until they	come	closer,	the	figures	are	men.	They	are	soldiers	wearing	dark,	ragged uniforms.	On	their	arms	are	dirty	red	rags.	As	they	come	nearer,	they	suddenly transform.	No	longer	men,	they	have	become	something	bestial,	something hideous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	view	zooms	in	on	one	as	it	searches	the	wastes.	It	snarls	viciously	at	the viewer.	Its	face	like	that	of	an	animal:	a	pig-like	snout,	tusks	protruding	from	a hideous	mouth,	the	face	covered	in	dark,	course	hair.	It	finds	what	it	was searching	for	and	stares	at	the	nursery,	already	blazing,	children	running	in mortal	terror.	A	caricature	of	a	grin	spreads	across	its	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Guns	blaze,	the	hideous	chatter	roaring	across	the	deathly	landscape.	Children scream,	then	fall,	rendered	pathetic,	bloodstained	heaps	amidst	the	mud	and	the filth.	The	beasts	emit	cruel	laughter.	Then	a	child’s	laugh	cuts	through	the hideous	mirth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	creatures	stop,	looking	about	in	anger	and	hate.	They	see	a	young	child, oblivious	to	the	death	and	destruction	about	her.	She	sits	on	a	patch	of	grass,	an oasis	in	Hell.	All	around	her	are	dolls	and	the	girl	sits	talking	to	them,	brushing the	hair	of	one	that	sits	upon	her	lap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	creatures	gather	about	her,	their	very	presence	causing	the	grass	to	wither and	die.	The	girl	looks	up,	her	jade	eyes	wide	with	sudden	terror.	Her	pretty	pink dress	is	splattered	with	dark	mud.	The	girl	opens	her	mouth	to	scream	as	a	cruel knife	glistens	in	the	weak	light	of	the	sun.	A	boot	crushes	a	doll	into	the	mud	as they	gather	round	her	innocent,	defenceless	form. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly	a	creature	falls,	blood	pouring	from	its	open	mouth.	The	rest	flee,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a>gunfire	cuts	them	down	in	mid-stride.	They	fall	into	the	mud	to	be	sucked	down into	the	hidden	depths,	like	demons	returning	to	the	underworld.	The	clouds break	and	the	sun	shines	down,	its	warming	gaze	restoring	life	to	the	ruined plain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	little	girl	gazes	up	at	a	soldier	and	smiles.	The	newcomer’s	uniform	is spotless.	Beneath	a	blue	beret,	blond	hair	is	visible.	When	the	soldier	looks	down at	the	girl	his	blue	eyes	glisten	in	the	light.	Teeth	revealed	in	a	comforting	smile shine	whitely	as	the	soldier	stoops	to	lift	the	little	girl.	Together,	the	child	and	the soldier	look	across	the	reviving	plain,	to	a	point	on	the	distant	horizon.	The	view fades,	and	a	new	one	comes	into	focus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	pleasant	park.	Flowerbeds	border	a	pond,	which	glistens	brightly	in	the	sun.	A child	sits	with	her	mother,	she	laughs	happily.	Around	them	play	other	children and	their	laughter	fills	the	park. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly	the	view	zooms	out.	A	great	wall	is	revealed	in	the	distance.	Dark silhouettes	patrol	its	ramparts	while	helicopters	patrol	the	skies	about	it.	The zoom	pulls	out	further.	Gradually	the	view	of	the	walled	garden	pulls	out	into space.	The	fortified	garden	is	Earth.	Cradle	of	Humanity.	Cradle	of	Civilisation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Spinning	slowly	in	the	blackness	of	solar	space,	it	is	protected	in	its	innocence by	the	golden	haired	warriors,	surrounded	on	all	sides	by	enemies	determined	to lay	it	to	waste. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	the	darkness	of	space	steps	a	man.	He	is	smartly	dressed	in	an	expensive suit.	Corporate	in	style,	exuding	authority.	The	man’s	face	is	white,	his	grey	hair combed	smoothly	over	a	high	forehead.	Piercing	grey	eyes	stare	at	the	viewer	as he	smiles	slightly.	Benevolent,	paternal,	reassuring.	The	Corporate	Patriarch,	nay the	Corporate	Deity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	man	is	Emile	Laurent.	Leader	of	the	Christian	Democrat	Coalition	Party, and	incumbent	Terran	President.	The	message	in	the	earlier	computer-graphic display	was	a	much-used	theme,	but	revolution	on	one	of	Earth’s	distant	colonies added	a	new	twist	to	the	election	broadcast.	Now	those	hideous,	bestial	monsters were	no	longer	shadowy,	ill-defined	enemies.	They	had	been	identified.	They were	communists.	In	Terran	propaganda	they	reared	up	from	obsolescence	to destroy	-	and	only	to	destroy.	It	was	only	this	fortress,	this	ring	of	golden	haired, gleaming	toothed	heroes	that	kept	the	enemies	from	ravaging	the	beautiful	Eden that	was	Earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a>And	it	was	the	CDCP	that	was	most	committed	to	defence.	The	other	parties,	of course,	were	backsliders.	Uncommitted	to	defence,	and	thus	to	the	liberties	that needed	such	defence.	Vote	for	the	CDCP	and	that	garden	of	tranquillity	would	be preserved	for	all	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">AS	news	broke	across	the	galaxy	concerning	Greyermede’s	fall,	Earth	was running	up	to	an	election.	The	parties	seized	upon	the	event	as	a	weapon	against their	political	opponents.	Only	the	CDCP’s	mismanagement	could	have	allowed such	a	thing	to	happen,	it	was	said.	While	the	CDCP	claimed	to	be	the	only	party resolute	enough	to	handle	matters	of	guarding	democracy	and	liberty.	As	much as	they	feared	the	Revolution,	they	used	it	to	suit	their	own	ends.	Candidates proclaimed	ever	more	hysterically	how	their	party	would	combat	the	Red	Tide once	they	were	in	office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	public	relations	companies	and	the	ad-men	working	for	the	parties’</p>
<p class="calibre1">campaign	offices	had	a	field	day	conjuring	up	ever	more	dramatic	images	of	the threat	posed	by	socialism.	Cynical	media	manipulation	designed	to	terrify	the electorate	into	voting	this	way	or	that.	The	propaganda	against	the	Revolution spiralled	into	increasingly	hysterical	imagery.	In	a	fantastic	phantasmagoria	of untruth,	the	Revolution	was	the	demon	knocking	at	the	door,	the	monster	in	the closet,	waiting	to	leap	out	and	devour	Terran	liberty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IN	the	Revolution’s	wake,	a	storm	of	class	struggle	erupted	through	the Metropolitan	Worlds.	All	this	brought	increased	worry	to	the	Terran Government,	beset	by	problems:	Attacks	on	its	record	in	handling	the	economy, its	short	sighted	social	policies,	and	most	damning,	it	had	been	in	office	when Greyermede	fell.	Why	hadn’t	they	foreseen	this?	Why	hadn’t	they	taken	steps earlier?	How	could	they	have	let	this	evil	happen? </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	the	parties	bickered	over	who	should	next	govern	Earth,	others	screamed for	action.	The	Corporate	Barons,	fearing	for	their	financial	fiefdoms, bombarded	Laurent’s	administration	for	action.	Their	property	had	been	stolen under	their	very	noses.	The	stock	markets	were	falling	and	companies	were losing	billions.	Why	wasn’t	the	Government	doing	anything?	Why? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daily	the	media	poured	forth	more	images	of	horror.	Crying	out	in	ever	more vicious	tones,	the	threat	facing	all	that	was	democratic,	all	that	was	free,	all	that was	sacred.	They	worded	their	diatribes	in	the	language	of	universal	humanity, when	in	fact	they	meant	their	capitalist	paymasters.	While	some,	less	subtle</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a>perhaps,	cut	through	the	mystifying	veil	of	middle	class	politics.	They	went straight	for	the	heart.	If	the	workers	will	rebel,	they	said,	then	why	should	we	not crush	them?	Are	we	not	the	masters?	Shall	we	suffer	to	be	questioned	in	our	own house?	And	these	commentators	spoke	the	very	thoughts	of	the	capitalists, voicing	what	their	paymasters	would	not	dream	of	admitting,	for	fear	of destroying	the	illusion	of	democracy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[A]	Red	Tide	is	sweeping	through	our	civilisation.	Ignored	it	threatens	to	engulf us.	This	disease	of	communism	is	infecting	the	hearts	and	minds	of	billions, eating	away	at	the	foundations	of	our	proud	corporate	citadels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet,	this	is	no	utopian	fancy.	It	lives	in	the	heart	and	minds	of	these	billions.	This heart	must	be	savagely	cut	out.	There	can	be	no	question	as	to	who	rules	the stars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Gauntlet	of	class	war	has	been	thrown	down	to	us,	and	we	would	be	fools	to ignore	the	challenge.	We	must	take	up	the	Gauntlet.	We	must	meet	our	ancient class	enemies	head	on	and	crush	them	utterly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	the	socialists	desire	class	war	then	we	shall	give	them	class	war.	War	unending until	the	last	perpetrator	of	this	disease	is	destroyed.	War	without	mercy.	Without limit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Red	Fist	of	the	Revolution	flies	free	over	Greyermede.	An	affront	to	every civilised	value.	But	we	too	have	our	fist.	A	brutal	fist	as	befits	these	perilous times.	A	fist	of	deadly	uranium.	With	this,	our	Uranium	Fist,	we	can	and	we must	smite	the	followers	of	the	Red	Fist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	revolution	must	be	drowned	in	blood.	The	blood	of	its	creators	spilled	in great	torrents	until	all	the	edifices	of	communism	are	flushed	down	the	drain	of history…12</p>
<p class="calibre1">NOT	all	the	newspapers	were	quite	so	melodramatic,	but	one	way	or	another they	all	screamed	for	the	Revolution’s	blood.	They	all	attacked	the Government’s	seeming	inaction.	In	the	meantime,	Laurent	addressed	the	Earth, appeasing	his	detractors	with	smooth	promises. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Friends!	Citizens	of	Earth!”	Laurent	said.	“The	enemy	has	struck.	Thieves	have stolen	the	colony	of	Greyermede	from	its	rightful	owners,	and	even	now,	they threaten	the	rest	of	civilisation	with	their	darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a>“I	fear	for	the	law-abiding	people	of	that	stricken	colony.	I	grieve	at	the	thought of	what	hardship,	what	terror	they	must	be	going	through	right	now.	I	suffer	with them,	every	injustice	that	these	vile	communists…	these	criminals,	carry	out against	the	innocent	multitudes,	but	they	are	not	forgotten.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Laurent’s	grave	face	stared	at	the	cameras	a	while.	His	grey	eyes	catching	the gleam	of	the	lights.	Behind	his	reassuring,	sincere	form	stretched	the	metropolis of	Paris,	the	lights	of	that	great	city	shining	like	multi-coloured	jewels	on	black velvet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rest	assured,	our	friends	on	that	raped	colony	will	be	assisted.	The	Government of	Earth	shall	not	let	them	languish	in	their	suffering	a	moment	longer	than	they must.	Nor	will	the	screaming	hordes	of	communists	tear	down	the	freedoms	that, perhaps,	we	have	taken	too	much	for	granted.	We	must	be	vigilant	against	these jealous,	mindless	wreckers.	For	of	course	they	exist	within,	as	well	as	without. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	are	under	siege,	but	we	shall	weather	the	storm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	friends!	I	ask	you	to	be	calm,	but	vigilant.	Together	we	can	defeat	this	Red menace.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">AS	the	press	screamed	for	blood,	as	the	political	parties	continued	their	back stabbing	and	mud-slinging,	as	capitalism	trembled	on	a	cliff-edge,	the	Laurent government	began	to	act.	They	acted	in	great	swiftness,	in	fact,	but	as	ever,	they operated	behind	the	scenes.	To	the	planet’s	population,	Laurent	seemed	to fumble	as	civilisation	tottered.	There	was	no	indecision	of	course.	There	had never	been	any	decision	to	take.	Laurent,	and	the	corporations	he	represented, knew	exactly	what	they	must	do.	It	was	Laurent’s	fait	acompli,	to	be	announced to	world	once	it	was	underway.	More	than	just	a	strike	at	the	Revolution,	it	was	a blow	aimed	at	his	political	rivals. </p>

<p class="calibre1">WHILE	Earth’s	ruling	class	felt	the	chill	winds	of	revolution,	Mars	regarded	the news	of	Greyermede’s	fall	in	silence.	The	Martian	Government	was	in something	of	a	state	of	shock.	In	the	days	of	the	Opposition	Coalition,	they supported	the	colony’s	claims	for	independence.	Such	scorn	they	poured	upon Earth;	calling	her	the	bastion	of	reaction	and	the	enemy	of	democracy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Greyermede	was	a	means	to	continue	a	war	of	words	against	Earth,	his	major rival.	Just	another	potential	weakness	to	exploit.	In	so	doing,	they	pumped	aid	to the	opposition	parties.	Some	companies,	it	is	said,	even	provided	assistance	to the	terrorist	organisations.	As	for	the	Martian	Intelligence	Service,	there	is	no doubt	that	they	provided	aid	to	these	groups.	In	combating	the	terrorists,	the revolutionaries	discovered	many	caches	of	Martian-made	weapons.

An	independent	capitalist	Greyermede	posed	no	threat	to Mars.	It	would	be	yet	another	world	for	them	to	dominate	through	their	financial influence,	another	tool	in	their	rivalry	with	Earth.	A	communist	Greyermede	was dangerous	beyond	their	worst	nightmares. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	if	the	Martian	proletariat	became	too	deeply	infected	with	this	disease,	as they	saw	it?	The	Martian	Government	trembled	as	mightily	as	their	Terran counterparts	at	that	awful	spectre.	While	the	Revolution	lived	it	would	stand	as	a monument	to	their	impending	doom	and	inspire	hope	in	the	workers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	determination	to	hold	their	territory	forever	had	endangered	the	whole	of	the civilised	galaxy.	Because	of	Earth’s	shortsighted	greed,	the	enemy	of	everything that	was	free,	and	just,	and	peace	loving	was	poised	to	plunge	the	galaxy	into	a nightmare	of	totalitarian	despotism.	By	Earth’s	failure	to	capitulate	to	reason, Greyermede	gave	birth	to	an	unreasonable,	virulent	evil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	thus	interstellar	capitalism	trembled	in	fear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">BEHIND	the	accusations,	Mars	and	Earth	joined	forces.	The	two	pillars	of</p>

<p class="calibre1">From	across	the	widest	reaches	of	the	galaxy,	Earth	began	to	assemble	its	war machine.	Weeks	passed	as	they	returned	to	the	Central	System.	In	orbit	around Deimos,	the	great	ships	of	war	gathered.	Battleships,	carriers,	destroyers, hospital	ships,	troop	carriers,	command	ships,	all	met	at	Mars’	main	offworld military	base. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	month	it	took	to	gather	these	instruments	of	mass	destruction.	Two	weeks more	to	prepare.	Then	all	was	ready.	In	April	2239	the	joint	Terran/Martian	fleet left	orbit	around	Deimos	and	travelled	out	into	the	extra-solar	deeps.	Beyond Pluto’s	distant	orbit,	the	fleet	plunged	into	hyperspace. </p>

<p class="calibre1">NEW	Tokyo	is	the	oldest	and	the	greatest	of	Martian	cities.	Resting	on	the	site	of the	first	settler	colony	established	two	hundred	years	ago,	it	has	become	a teeming	metropolis	where	every	race,	nationality	and	creed	from	neighbouring Earth	has	gathered.	Constantly	swollen	by	immigration,	it	is	now	the	capital	of	a thriving	republic,	independent	for	nearly	a	hundred	and	fifty	years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	city	is	a	strange	jumble	of	architectural	styles.	Traditional	Japanese13</p>
<p class="calibre1">architecture	stands	side	by	side	with	neo-classical	designs;	even	a	scaled-down gothic	cathedral	exists	for	the	benefit	of	the	city’s	Catholic	population,	but	by	far the	most	dominant	is	the	typically	bland	architecture	of	corporate	capitalism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	taxi	took	me	down	East	98th	Street.	The	road	was	bordered	with	luxurious trees,	those	genetically	engineered	breeds	that	thrive	on	the	strange	Martian light,	and	tolerate	the	ozone	‘smog’	from	heavy	traffic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike	Mars	Field,	New	Tokyo	has	a	little	character.	It	is	more	crowded	for	one thing,	more	cosmopolitan.	Colonial	cities	are	usually	drab	in	design,	but	New Tokyo	is	old	enough	to	have	developed	a	degree	of	unpredictability.	Its	different building	styles	are	a	token	of	this:	the	city	has	outgrown	the	original	bland	layout of	the	planetary	engineers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">AT	last	my	taxi	stopped	on	Hiroshima	Boulevard,	I	paid	the	driver	and	stepped out	into	the	crowded	street.	Pushing	through,	I	made	my	way	towards	the	New Tokyo	Art	Gallery.	The	great	building	was	designed	to	resemble	a	Shinto	temple. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside,	the	air	was	much	cooler,	a	pleasant	relief	from	the	stifling	atmosphere outside.	My	footsteps	creaked	over	the	imported	oak	floor	as	I	walked	through the	foyer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wandered	into	the	main	gallery,	ignoring	the	strange	sculptures	that	rested	on the	floor;	bizarre	shapes	that	looked	like	the	mutated	offspring	of	industrial machinery,	or	idealised	statues	of	the	early	colonists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walking	around	the	borders	of	a	particularly	ugly	display;	all	bricks	and	beer cans	and	twisted	copper	wire,	under	the	title	‘Red	Planet	Dawning’,	I	saw	those	I had	come	to	meet.	The	two	men	were	waiting	for	me	at	the	far	end	of	the	gallery and	I	hastened	to	meet	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a>Yousef	Zabir	looked	up	at	a	great	mural	that	decorated	the	wall.	It	depicted	a scene	of	the	city’s	early	construction.	The	image	was	a	bizarre	setting	of	two planetary	engineers,	dressed	in	smart	suits,	leaning	over	a	rough	trestle	table	that contained	a	layout	design	of	the	city.	Compass,	slide-rule	and	pencils	littered	the blueprint.	Behind	them	a	city	was	taking	shape.	An	unformed	dome	rose	to	the skies,	its	uppermost	edges	rough	and	unfinished.	Within	the	dome’s	structure stood	the	skeletal	images	of	half-formed	buildings.	Smaller	figures	of spacesuited	men	toiled	beneath	them.	Working	with	block	and	tackle,	hammer and	chisel.	Not	a	single	piece	of	modern	construction	machinery	appeared anywhere	in	the	picture.	The	artist	had	painted	the	impression	of	ancient	builders constructing	a	modern	domed	city	on	the	barren	plains	of	Mars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	image	belied	the	reality	in	more	than	the	technological	anachronisms.	No colonist	built	these	cities,	just	hard	pressed	construction	workers	recruited	from the	poorest	regions	of	Earth.	The	mural	didn’t	tell	the	tale	of	the	thousands	who died	to	build	the	city.	Or	of	the	handful	who	made	a	fortune	from	the	tendered construction	contracts.	It	displayed	hopeful	colonists	working	together	for	the benefit	of	all	mankind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Crap!”	was	Zabir’s	verdict,	a	view	that	would	no	doubt	shock	New	Tokyo’s	art devotees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Together	we	sat	down	on	an	imported-marble	bench,	positioned	by	an	ornate bonsai	display.	Harper	took	out	a	cigarette	and	lit	up,	ignoring	the	no	smoking sign	on	the	wall	just	a	few	feet	away.	Shrouded	in	the	cigarette	smoke,	Harper leaned	back	against	the	backrest,	closed	his	eyes	in	thought,	and	began	to	speak. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“IT	was	a	quiet	evening.	There	wasn’t	much	traffic.	We’d	been	severed	from	the main	shipping	routes	after	we	seized	control	of	our	world.

<p class="calibre1">We	were	blind	now.	We	couldn’t	help	any	further.	I	jumped	as	I	heard	a	loud buzzing.	I	was	surprised	to	find	I	was	trembling,	but	I’d	never	handled	an emergency	crash	down	before. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“‘Tom?	Our	cripple’s	in	sight.	She’s	just	come	in	over	the	horizon.	It’s approaching	damn	fast	and…	Good	God!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘What	is	it?	Steve?	What’s	happening	up	there?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Sweet	Jesus!’	The	sudden	exclamation	took	me	by	surprise.	Before	I	could speak	a	terrible	grinding	noise	ripped	through	the	tower.	It	was	accompanied	by an	intense	shuddering,	like	a	powerful	moonquake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Steve!	Steve!’	There	was	no	response	from	the	other	end.	The	line	was completely	dead.	Then	a	cry	of	amazement	from	one	of	the	monitoring	staff caught	my	attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Oh	my	God!	Blips!’	he	shouted.	‘Five,	ten,	fifteen…	they’re	filling	the	whole screen!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	heart-stopping	sound	of	klaxons	prevented	further	thought.	‘Everybody out!’	I	cried	above	the	awful	noise.	My	crew	didn’t	need	telling	twice;	pale-faced they	rushed	out	of	the	room.	I	followed	right	behind	them,	no	less	frightened than	they	were.	In	all	my	time	on	Gateway	the	city	had	never	been	evacuated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Outside,	the	corridors	were	crowded	with	people.	All	the	staff	from	the	port control	facilities	jostled	to	get	into	the	main	complex	and	from	there	to	the shuttle	bays.	I	pushed	my	way	through	the	people,	going	against	the	flow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally	I	grabbed	hold	of	someone’s	arm	as	they	rushed	for	the	stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Where’s	the	control	room	staff?’	I	yelled	over	the	noise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘What?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘WHERE’S	THE	CONTROL	ROOM	STAFF?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘The	emergency	bulkheads	are	sealed.	They’re	all	dead!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	news	stunned	me.	I	didn’t	notice	as	the	man	pulled	away	from	my	grip	and disappeared	into	the	rush.	The	cripple	must	have	hit	the	tower,	but	with	the	doors sealed	what	was	the	emergency? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a>“Too	many	questions.	And	I	didn’t	have	the	answers.	All	I	knew	was	the complex	was	being	evacuated.	My	daughter	would	have	been	in	the	education block.	My	wife	at	work…	no,	it	was	her	day	off.	She’d	make	her	way	to	collect Emma,	my	daughter.	I	had	to	get	them	before	heading	for	the	shuttles.	I	rushed for	the	stairs,	becoming	part	of	that	chaotic	rush. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“OUT	in	the	main	administration	block	the	rush	was	less.	The	corridors	were wider,	and	most	of	the	people	had	already	made	their	way	into	the	main complex.	Gateway’s	Red	Guard	and	militia	scoured	the	complex.	One	saw	me and	waved	me	towards	the	exits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Please,	clear	the	complex!’	The	man	was	wearing	a	pressure	suit,	his	helmet dangling	from	a	suit	strap.	I	noticed	he	carried	his	gun	in	a	ready	position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Why	are	we	being	evacuated?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	militiaman	looked	troubled	for	a	moment.	‘I’m	sorry	comrade;	there’s	no time	for	that	now.	You	have	to	get	to	the	shuttles!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Something	occurred	to	me	and	I	ran	towards	one	of	the	windows	looking	over the	city.	The	complex	stretched	beneath	me;	an	oasis	of	regular	shaped	structures and	gleaming	domes	surrounded	by	the	barren	greyness	of	the	moon’s	surface.	I looked	to	the	lunar	wastes	beyond.	Nothing	could	have	prepared	me	for	what	I saw.	About	a	mile	from	the	city’s	perimeter,	a	ship	was	parked	on	the	plain.	And it	wasn’t	a	freighter	either.	It	was	a	Terran	attack	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	gaze	went	up	to	space.	The	bright	crescent	that	was	my	homeworld	looked so	fragile	in	the	darkness	of	space.	I	saw	another	bright	point	of	light,	a blossoming	fire	that	burned	brilliantly	for	a	few	seconds	before	fading	to blackness.	A	fighter	streaked	across	my	field	of	vision	like	a	shooting	star. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind	me	the	militiaman	approached	and	placed	his	gloved	hand	on	my shoulder.	“‘Yes,’	he	softly	said,	‘the	Terrans	are	here.’” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	24</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	running	through	the	complex	again.	Behind	me,	the	militiaman	struggled to	keep	up.	I	wondered	if	anyone	else	knew	we	were	under	attack.	Then	an explosion	sounded	from	somewhere,	followed	by	the	sharp	crack	of	gunfire	and terrified	screams.	That	was	my	answer.	The	Terrans	were	already	in	the	complex. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘You	can’t	go	that	way!’	my	companion	cried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘I’ve	got	to	find	my	family!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	turned	down	into	another	corridor.	The	militiaman	struggled	to	keep	up, protesting	all	the	way.	A	burst	of	gunfire	and	a	blood-curdling	scream	echoed down	the	corridor.	I	stopped	in	fear	as	the	militiaman	raised	his	rifle.	A	squad	of Red	Guard	appeared	round	the	corner.	Two	dragged	an	injured	comrade	between them,	their	smoke-stained	faces	were	full	of	terror. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Get	back!’	one	of	them	yelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Terran	troops	followed	behind	them.	I	cried	out	a	warning	as	I	saw	them	turn the	corridor.	Terror	gripped	my	heart	at	the	sight	of	their	inhuman	forms.	These weren’t	the	troops	that	fought	so	hard	on	Greyermede.	These	were	Colonial Marines,	Earth’s	elite	fighting	force.	They	were	dressed	in	grey	and	black mottled	pressure	suits.	Battle	armour	covered	their	suits	as	did	grey	camouflage netting	to	break	up	the	shape	of	their	bodies.	Their	heads	were	encased	in	sleek helmets,	features	hidden	behind	black	tinted	visors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	cry	alerted	the	Red	Guard.	Several	turned	around	to	give	covering	fire while	the	rest	of	us	fled.	Looking	back,	I	saw	one	marine	go	down,	the	sinister visor	no	more	than	crazy	fracture	lines	around	a	blood-rimmed	hole.	The marines	returned	fire,	cutting	the	rearguard	down.	We	escaped	round	the	corner as	the	marines	silently	advanced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	ran	down	more	corridors.	Gunfire	sounded	from	some	of	the	junctions	we passed.	Several	times	I	almost	stumbled	over	bodies.	I	turned	yet	another	corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	end	of	the	passage,	a	scrabbling	heap	of	people	struggled	to	escape	a squad	of	marines.	Unarmed	civilians	pleaded	and	died	as	the	marines	mercilessly cut	them	down.	Bullets	slammed	into	the	walls	near	me.	We	hastily	retraced	our</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>steps,	but	several	more	encounters	with	marines	convinced	us	we	were	trapped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Make	for	the	main	dome!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘We	can’t!	It’s	against	evacuation	procedure!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Was	the	procedure	devised	for…	for	this?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	militiaman	didn’t	answer.	He	couldn’t	really.	We	ran	for	the	main	dome, the	centre	of	the	whole	complex.	I	ran	into	the	dome	without	thinking,	suddenly bereft	of	what	little	cover	the	corridors	had	offered.	I	cursed	at	my	stupidity,	but I	was	thankful	that	the	dome	wasn’t	yet	under	attack.	I	started	towards	the corridor	leading	towards	the	accommodation	blocks,	but	the	militiaman	stopped me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘I	can’t	let	you	down	there,	I	mean	it!’	he	yelled,	almost	hysterically.	‘It’s crawling	with	Terrans!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘But	my	family,	they’ll	be	in	there!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘You	can’t	reach	them.	You’ll	be	killed	in	minutes.	If	they’re	still	alive	they	can still	reach	the	shuttles.	How’s	getting	yourself	killed	going	to	help	them?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	could	see	his	logic,	but	I	was	frightened	for	them.	I	placed	my	hands	on	his arms	to	remove	his	grip	from	my	shoulders.	As	I	did	so	he	was	thrown	against me.	I	felt	something	wet	covering	my	shirt	as	he	stared	into	my	face,	his	mouth open,	his	eyes	wide	in	shock.	Blood	dribbled	from	his	mouth	as	be	sank	to	the ground,	his	weight	pulling	me	with	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gunfire	rattled	through	the	dome	as	marines	stormed	in.	I	looked	up	and	saw them	streaming	in	through	the	corridor	we	had	used	only	minutes	before.	I glanced	down	at	my	companion.	He	was	dead.	My	shirt	was	drenched	in	the man’s	blood.	It	occurred	to	me	then	that	I	didn’t	know	his	name.	Now	I	never would. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Panic	gripped	me.	Terrified	people	jostled	me	as	I	ran	across	the	concourse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dark	figures	merged	with	the	crowd,	killing	as	they	ran.	Something	tripped	me in	my	blind	haste.	I	moaned	in	horror	when	I	saw	what	I	had	fallen	over:	a corpse	lay	beneath	me.	One	blue	eye	stared	mournfully	into	my	own.	The	other eye	was	gone,	along	with	one	whole	side	of	the	victim’s	face.	Nothing	was	left</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>but	a	gaping,	blood-soaked	hole.	I	fought	to	prevent	myself	from	throwing	up	as the	massacre	continued	above	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Red	Guard	and	militia	battled	with	the	marines	and	several	Terrans	fell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	there	were	too	many	of	them,	I	could	see	that.	The	defenders	couldn’t	stem the	tide.	Nor	were	they	experienced	in	such	combat.	The	Colonial	Marines	were renowned	for	their	experience	in	low-gravity,	zero-pressure	assaults. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	the	battle	raged,	I	crawled	along	the	deck.	Soon	I	risked	climbing	to	my	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	woman	died	in	front	of	me,	her	chest	erupting	in	a	red	shower	as	a	bullet struck	her	in	the	back.	With	a	soft	moan	she	fell	to	the	deck.	The	sight	didn’t really	register	in	my	numbed	brain.	It	was	just	one	more	horror	in	a	world	of horrors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	possibility	of	the	dome	being	punctured	dominated	my	mind.	Just	one	stray bullet	and	we	could	have	all	died.	Sucked	out	into	vacuum.	It	made	me	quicken my	pace	towards	the	exit.	Even	so,	exertion	was	beginning	to	tell.	My	breathing was	heavy	and	my	limbs	felt	like	lead.	A	dull	roaring	sounded	in	my	ears, partially	drowning	out	the	screams	and	the	gunfire.	I	was	grateful	for	that.	I couldn’t	stand	the	sounds	of	the	terror,	of	the	death	that	surrounded	me.	I	just wanted	to	get	out.	To	live. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	militiaman	fired	on	a	squad	of	marines.	Two	went	down,	but	another	aimed his	weapon	and	let	off	a	burst.	The	militiaman	twisted	in	agony	as	the	bullets thudded	into	his	body.	His	finger	jerked	on	the	trigger	of	his	assault	rifle	and erratic	shots	whined	through	the	air	as	he	completed	his	twisting	fall.	Several bullets	punctured	the	dome. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Air	began	to	trickle	into	space,	then	it	gushed	out	as	the	pressure	pushed	out	the shattered	glass	fragments	around	the	bullet	holes.	My	heart	began	to	pound	in	a fresh	rush	of	adrenaline	and	I	raced	madly	for	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Attention!	Attention!’	proclaimed	the	calm	tones	of	a	synthesised	voice, strangely	cutting	through	the	sounds	of	the	carnage.	‘Persistent	pressure	loss	in the	main	dome	requires	all	personnel	to	evacuate	the	area	immediately.	There	is a	projected	three-minute	safety	margin	before	the	dome	fails…’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	computer	got	that	wrong.	With	a	loud	boom,	the	ruptured	panels	blew	out into	space.	A	wind	blew	through	the	dome	as	the	air-loss	increased.	The	terrible howling	drowned	out	all	other	noise	as	the	air	relentlessly	vacated	the	dome.	A</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>marine	was	sucked	through	the	hole,	his	body	slammed	against	the	intact	edges before	being	ejected	into	space,	his	broken	body	tossed	like	a	rag	doll.	Others followed.	The	howling	wind	ripped	at	my	hair,	at	my	clothes.	Loose	debris blasted	through	the	dome. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gunshots	still	continued	to	be	exchanged	as	the	survivors	fought	against	the winds	to	reach	the	exits.	Terran	bullets	killed	many	at	the	back	as	they	struggled to	escape.	In	a	daze	brought	about	by	shock	and	fear	I	joined	the	crowds, fighting	and	struggling	to	get	through	the	door.	A	thrill	of	desperate	fear	tickled my	spine.	I	wasn’t	going	to	make	it.	I	wasn’t	going	to	make	it!	I	pushed	forward all	the	harder,	driving	others	before	me.	At	last	I	was	in	the	corridor.	The	air	was noticeably	thinner	and	I	began	to	gasp	for	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	never	more	grateful	for	anything	when	I	heard	the	crash	door	slam	into place	behind	me.	Finally	preventing	the	air’s	escape,	it	also	shut	out	the	horrible sounds	of	the	carnage	left	behind.	Safe	for	the	moment,	I	thought	vaguely	of	my family.	I	hoped	they	had	been	able	to	reach	the	shuttles.	But	at	that	moment	my own	survival	beckoned,	I	tried	to	block	everything	out	of	my	mind, concentrating	only	on	reaching	the	safety	of	the	escape	ships. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Soon	the	comforting	sight	of	those	shuttles	appeared;	relief	swept	through	my weary	body.	It	wasn’t	long	before	I	was	sat	aboard	one	of	those	ships.	Within minutes	the	vibrations	of	the	shuttle’s	great	engines	rumbled	through	the	cabin and	took	us	away	from	the	horror.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“THE	shuttle	was	filled	with	survivors	huddling	tightly	in	the	passenger	cabin, their	minds	and	bodies	succumbing	to	shock.	Whimpering	and	crying	were	the only	sounds.	The	noise	of	take-off	had	faded	away	to	a	dull	rumble,	more	felt than	heard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	man	sat	next	to	me,	his	head	scabbed	with	drying	blood.	Tears	stained	his cheeks	as	he	rocked	back	and	forth.	His	arms	held	a	bloody	bundle:	a	baby	that caught	a	stray	bullet.	It	was	obviously	dead.	I	looked	away,	remembering	my own	family.	I	didn’t	know	what	had	become	of	them.	I	only	hoped	they	had made	it	out	of	the	city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	shuttle	veered	suddenly.	The	motion	caused	several	people	to	moan	in	fear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	out	of	the	porthole	by	my	head.	The	shuttle	was	orbiting	around Greyermede	and	the	sun	was	coming	into	view	over	the	planet’s	Eastern Hemisphere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	shuttle	shifted	to	avoid	the	wreckage	of	some	innocent	freighter.	The	ruin tumbled	in	an	unstable	orbit,	ravaged	by	fire	fuelled	by	the	ship’s	internal	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Part	of	a	docking	arm	trailed	from	the	vessel’s	hull.	Beyond	it	the	shattered wreckage	of	one	of	the	orbital	docks	drifted.	I	saw	another	dock	beyond	that wreck.	Small	darting	objects	surrounded	it.	Brief	flashes	of	light	appeared	as they	fired	on	the	orbital	installation	and	explosions	erupted	from	its	hull. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	freighter	blasted	off,	its	flight-path	erratic	as	it	struggled	to	leave	the	killing zone.	Fighters	pursued	the	freighter,	firing	mercilessly	at	its	retreating	bulk.	A bright	glare	heralded	its	complete	destruction.	The	wreckage	tumbled	away,	like a	dandelion	clock	scattered	on	the	wind.	Then	it	was	lost	in	the	blackness	of space. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	shuttle	travelled	further,	preparing	to	take	us	into	atmosphere	where	we would	be	safe	from	the	reach	of	those	vicious	fighters.	I	tried	to	rest,	to	blot	out the	images	of	destruction	from	my	mind,	but	they	wouldn’t	leave	me	in	peace.	I couldn’t	forget	the	horrible	screaming,	the	gunshots,	and	the	terror	of	the	dome depressurising.	I	closed	my	eyes,	and	then	opened	them.	Better	to	see	the terrified,	bloodstained	figures	of	those	around	me,	than	those	horrible	images	of destruction	that	filled	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a>“The	shuttle	began	to	shake	violently.	I	gripped	the	arms	of	my	seat	tightly, thinking	we	were	hitting	atmosphere.	But	then	I	caught	a	stroboscopic	glare flickering	in	through	the	porthole.	My	eyes	were	drawn	to	the	view	outside.	I stared	wide-eyed	in	horror	at	the	tiny	points	of	light	streaking	past	our	vessel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	shuttle	veered	wildly	and	began	to	spin	a	desperate	dance	for	survival. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	fighter	streaked	past,	its	underside	gleaming	in	the	light	of	the	sun.	I	saw	it fade	to	a	point	of	light	only	to	turn	once	more	and	fly	at	our	ship,	its	weapons blazing	in	a	horrible	fire.	Closer,	ever	closer	the	fighter	flew,	until	I	thought	it would	hit	the	shuttle.	Then	it	soared	overhead.	I	didn’t	know	what	was	keeping us	from	destruction.	The	skill	of	our	pilot,	luck,	maybe	the	Terran	pilot	was playing	a	terrible	game	with	us.	I	didn’t	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	shuttle	changed	course	suddenly,	the	movement	taking	me	completely	by surprise	so	that	I	knocked	my	head	on	the	cabin	wall.	Blood	oozed	out	of	a	gash and	stained	my	shirt	collar.	I	could	see	the	fighter	again	as	it	moved	in	for	the kill,	or	maybe	it	was	another	one.	My	heart	began	to	race	until	I	thought	it	would burst.	I	couldn’t	take	my	eyes	from	the	porthole	as	I	saw	Death	coming	for	me.	I wanted	to	scream	but	for	some	reason	I	couldn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At	last	I	did	scream	as	a	terrible	explosion	rocked	the	shuttle.	But	I	wasn’t	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wasn’t	sucking	vacuum,	as	the	shuttle’s	hull	ripped	open.	As	the	glare	faded,	I saw	a	Customs	patrol	craft	veering	away	from	Greyermede,	the	wreckage	of	the Terran	fighter	drifted	in	its	newfound	orbit.	Then	the	shuttle	began	to	shake	once more.	But	this	time	it	was	the	honest	shaking	of	turbulence.	Of	a	shuttle	entering atmosphere	at	a	desperate,	too-steep	angle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	were	safe.	We	were	beyond	the	reach	of	those	fighters.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">HARPER	stopped	as	a	tear	trickled	down	his	cheek.	His	cigarette	had	become	a long	cylinder	of	ash	in	between	his	fingers.	I	looked	away	a	while,	wondering	if I	should	ask	what	was	on	my	mind.	Then	I	took	a	deep	breath	and	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	happened	to	your	family?	Did	they	escape?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harper	stared	into	space	for	a	few	moments.	Then	he	flicked	away	the	dead cigarette.	I	didn’t	think	he	would	reply,	but	then	he	quietly	spoke	up.	Not	looking at	me,	only	at	the	floor	beneath	his	booted	feet,	his	voice	was	so	quiet;	I	only	just heard	it. </p>

<p class="calibre1">THE	attack	on	Gateway	City	was	designed	to	sever	Greyermede	from	the	rest	of the	colonised	galaxy.	Sixty	seconds	after	the	attack	ship	touched	down	a	mile from	the	complex,	waves	of	Terran	fighters	swept	into	the	planet’s	orbital	space. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	targets	were	the	communication	satellites	that	ringed	the	unsuspecting world.	The	intention	was	to	destroy	all	intra-planetary	communications,	and effectively	dismember	the	revolutionary	body.	Once	the	satellites	were destroyed,	the	fighters	turned	their	attention	to	creating	as	much	carnage	as possible.	Orbital	docks,	freighters,	passenger	liners,	the	fleeing	shuttles themselves	were	all	destroyed	under	the	weapons	of	the	Terran	pilots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fighters	met	a	brave	resistance	from	commandeered	Customs	patrol	craft, and	several	were	destroyed.	Yet	these	lightly	armed	vessels	could	do	little	more than	hinder	the	enemy.	They	were	no	match	for	the	heavily	armed	TLA14</p>
<p class="calibre1">Vixens,	or	their	experienced	pilots.	None	survived	the	one-sided	dogfight, though	their	actions	certainly	saved	many	of	the	refugees The	Colonial	Marines	also	encountered	brave	resistance	as	they	stormed	the base.	The	small	detachments	of	Red	Guard	and	militia	stationed	in	the	complex were	outnumbered,	but	they	made	Earth	pay	dearly	for	every	section	to	be captured.	The	task	was	a	hopeless	one,	and	the	militia	fighters	knew	it.	The resistance	was	intended	solely	to	buy	time	for	the	city’s	inhabitants	to	escape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	fortunate	that	these	men	and	women	were	present	on	Gateway.	For	the Terran	assault	was	more	than	just	an	operation	to	retake	a	‘captured’	installation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	an	act	of	retribution	for	those	who	sought	to	overthrow	the	chains	of oppression.	To	this	end,	the	marines	unleashed	a	terrible	wave	of	bloodshed, slaughtering	man,	woman	and	child	as	they	surged	through	the	base. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had	these	men	and	women	not	been	present	to	provide	such	a	stiff	resistance few	people	would	have	escaped	the	slaughter,	and	perhaps	there	would	have been	no	witnesses	to	provide	an	account	of	the	Gateway	assault. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	it	was	only	a	thousand	or	so	survivors	managed	to	reach	the	surface	of Greyermede.	Nearly	two	thousand	were	killed,	not	including	those	victims aboard	the	orbiting	ports	and	the	wrecked	vessels. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>The	revolutionary	defenders	steadily	succumbed	to	Earth’s	military	might.	The final	confrontation	took	place	around	the	beleaguered	Exchange,	where interplanetary	communications	passed	in	and	out.	It	was	from	here	that	a desperate	message	was	continually	broadcast	to	the	stars.	No	coded,	standardised transmission,	but	persistent	pleas	for	help	from	the	galaxy’s	proletariat.	The message	ended	dramatically	and	ominously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	last	transmission	from	Greyermede,	picked	up	by	ships	across	the	sector, was	a	short	burst	of	gunfire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">GREYERMEDE	was	cut	off	from	the	rest	of	the	galaxy.	The	Terran	fleet controlled	the	world’s	orbital	approaches.	The	planet	lacked	the	sophisticated hardware	needed	to	mount	any	serious	defence.	All	its	people	could	do	was	wait until	the	Terrans	came	within	their	reach.	In	other	words	the	revolutionaries could	do	nothing	until	troops	were	landed	on	their	world. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Miniature	suns	a	mile	across	and	burning	at	three	million	degrees	seared	the surface.	In	the	immediate	blast	vicinity	everything	was	reduced	to	its	component atoms	as	the	intense	burst	of	heat	vaporised	steel,	stone,	glass,	flesh	and	blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Further	out	the	heat,	dissipated,	but	no	less	violent,	ignited	everything combustible.	Fuel	erupted	in	tanks.	Gas	mains	exploded.	Lakes	and	rivers	boiled to	nothing.	Human	beings	screamed	as	their	flesh	ignited	on	the	bones.	Houses, office	blocks,	shops,	men	and	women,	all	consumed	in	a	raging	conflagration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	those	fleeting	seconds	an	eternity	of	pain	and	death	swept	the	colony	of Greyermede.	For	miles	beyond	the	detonations,	the	destruction	was	total. </p>

<p class="calibre1">More	destruction	followed	in	the	wake	of	fire.	Fierce	winds	swept	the	ruination as	the	shock-fronts	followed	in	the	aftermath	of	their	creators.	Buildings shattered	in	the	intense	pressure.	Stone	and	concrete	flew	through	the	air,	deadly missiles	adding	to	the	death	and	destruction.	Fused	and	buckled	office	blocks exploded	into	lethal	shards	of	glass.	Even	vehicles	were	thrown	through	the	air in	that	awesome	force,	burning	as	they	pursued	their	angry	trajectory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Above	the	destruction,	the	raging	fireballs	sucked	up	dust	and	ash	from	the ruination.	Dragged	from	the	surface	by	the	terrible	convection	currents	powered by	the	dying	mini-suns,	columns	of	dark	filth	leapt	into	the	sky.	Meeting	with	the incandescent	furnaces	they	billowed	into	the	dreadful	form	of	a	gigantic mushroom.	An	angry	form	brooding	over	the	ravaged	surface,	a	symbol	of Earth’s	terrible	wrath.	As	the	fireballs	finally	consumed	themselves,	the mushroom	clouds	continued	to	convulse	with	ruined	matter.	Poisoning	it. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“I	was	weeping	in	the	darkness,”	Yousef	Zabir	began,	“huddled	up	in	a	ball	in the	corner	of	some	basement	just	crying	my	eyes	out.	I’d	never	known	such terror	as	I	did	when	the	earthquake	rocked	the	basement,	when	the	walls	cracked</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a>and	this	terrible	rumbling	sound	came	from	the	world	above.	I	clamped	my hands	over	my	ears	but	I	couldn’t	shut	it	out.	The	noise	and	the	quakes	seemed to	last	for	hours,	but	then	it	passed	and	I	opened	my	eyes	to	the	darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	mind	wandered	back	to	normality.	It	was	only	minutes	ago,	yet	it	felt	like years.	I’d	got	off	the	bus	on	my	way	to	work	and	was	walking	towards	the	city centre.	The	streets	were	crowded	with	people.	It	was	a	warm	day,	bright	skies, brilliant	clouds,	the	kind	of	day	where	you’d	rather	just	sit	on	the	grass	and	soak up	the	sun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	were	no	sirens	to	herald	the	disaster.	We	didn’t	have	any,	we’d	never needed	any.	Only	the	bells	warned	of	the	coming	destruction.	The	bells	of	a multitude	of	different	religions	that	still	lingered.	But	we	only	heard	them	with	a sense	of	curiosity,	looking	at	each	and	shrugging,	asking	ourselves	what	was	the occasion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	the	panic	hit.	The	news	of	mass	destruction	surged	through	the	crowd	in	a chain-reaction	of	horror.	The	source	was	probably	radio	broadcasts.	Portable radios,	car	stereos,	mobile	phones	whatever,	the	people	learned	that	death	was imminent	and	reacted	as	only	they	could	-	in	mortal	terror. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hundreds	of	people	ran	blindly,	without	direction,	not	knowing	where	to	go.	In the	midst	of	this	chaos	I	just	watched,	wondering	what	was	going	on	but	gnawed by	an	unformed	fear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	man	collided	with	me	and	knocked	me	to	the	pavement.	We	both	fell entangled	in	one	another’s	limbs.	Before	he	could	get	away	I	grabbed	hold	of him	and	shouted	at	him	to	tell	me	what	was	happening.	He	struggled	desperately. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Bombs!	Oh	my	God!	Oh	my	God!	I	kept	saying	repeatedly,	like	a	mantra	that would	somehow	prevent	the	Armageddon	if	I	just	said	it	often	enough.	I	looked around,	my	body	drenched	in	a	sudden	cold	sweat.	An	empty	office	block towered	above	me.	Without	thinking	I	ran	up	the	steps	towards	the	doors	and forced	my	way	inside.	I	couldn’t	hear	the	screaming	anymore,	just	the	thumping of	my	own	heart	and	the	blood	rushing	through	my	ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	world	became	a	white	glare	as	I	toppled	down	the	stairs	to	the	basement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lying	secure	in	the	bowels	of	the	earth,	I	huddled	up	in	a	corner,	my	mind tortured	with	horrible	images.	I	screamed,	but	I	couldn’t	hear	my	own	terror</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a>above	that	roar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“After	that,	a	horrible	silence.	I	just	sat	and	stared	into	the	darkness.	I	don’t know	how	long	I	sat	like	that.	Time	meant	nothing	in	that	black	pit.	I	wondered vaguely	if	I	was	dead,	that	the	blackness	around	me	was	some	nether	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Foolish	thoughts	for	a	confirmed	atheist,	but	I	wasn’t	exactly	in	a	rational	frame of	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	knew	I	couldn’t	stay	down	there.	For	one	thing,	I	had	to	know	that	the basement	hadn’t	become	my	tomb.	It	was	a	sudden	feeling	of	claustrophobia	that urged	me	to	get	out	into	the	open	air	again,	even	if	that	meant	stepping	out	into Hell	itself.	Rubble	partially	blocked	the	stairwell	making	it	a	difficult	climb	but at	last,	I	came	out	to	what	should	have	been	the	foyer.	Now	I	stood	in	the	open air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	light	was	too	much	to	bear	for	some	time.	Eventually,	when	my	eyes	got used	to	the	light,	I	looked	around.	What	I	saw	sapped	the	strength	from	my knees.	Great	piles	of	rubble	surrounded	me,	littered	with	twisted	girders	and shattered	glass.	Two	columns	from	the	building’s	facade	still	stood,	truncated	but still	recognisable.	The	remains	of	the	glass	front	lay	in	a	twisted	heap	before	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	realised	that	the	blast	had	hit	the	building	at	the	front,	thrusting	the	shattered remains	away	from	the	entrance.	If	it	hadn’t	been	for	that,	I	would	have	been entombed	alive	in	the	bowels	of	the	dead	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	took	some	time	for	my	senses	to	fully	digest	the	devastation.	The	ordered streets	with	their	tall	buildings	were	gone.	Trees,	lamp	posts,	and	cars	had	all been	picked	up	by	the	blast	and	scattered	over	the	ruined	plain.	The	road	that	had been	so	full	of	terrified	people	such	a	short	time	before	was	now	littered	with rubble.	No	trace	of	the	road	remained.	Only	the	battered	wrecks	of	cars	and buses	poked	through	the	piles	of	concrete	and	dust.	The	buildings	across	from me	were	low	mounds	of	rubble.	There	were	no	people.	Not	even	the	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	the	distance	I	saw	the	remnants	of	an	office	block.	The	glass	tower	still gleamed	in	the	diffused	light.	Inexplicably	much	of	the	building	still	stood,	only its	top	floors	sheared	away.	The	rest	of	the	tower	was	twisted	and	bent,	the	glass and	steel	fused	and	distorted	in	the	heat.	It	looked	as	though	the	architect	had taken	a	bad	trip	when	he	designed	it.	Beyond	the	tower	rose	a	horrible	sight;	a huge	billowing	cloud	of	dust	cascaded	high	into	the	air	and	dwarfed	the	ruined plain	beneath	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>“Slowly	visibility	worsened.	A	warm	breeze	brought	drifting	clouds	of	dust,	ash and	smoke	to	veil	the	landscape.	With	it	came	the	scent	of	cooked	meat.	The smell	went	to	my	stomach,	stimulating	pangs	of	hunger.	That	was	too	much	for me;	I	threw	up,	because	I	knew	that	‘cooked	meat’	could	only	be	human	flesh: living	breathing,	feeling	human	beings	baked	alive	within	the	ruins	of	their dying	city.	I	wept	again.	A	solitary	survivor	hidden	by	the	rubble,	burdened	by such	terrible	feelings	of	loneliness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">”	The	city	bore	no	relation	to	what	I	knew;	I	was	lost	in	a	barren	desert.	I	left	the ruin	that	had	been	my	salvation	and	stumbled	across	the	ravaged	city.	I	didn’t know	where	I	was	going,	or	what	I	was	looking	for.	My	vague	intention	was	to head	for	the	outskirts	of	the	city,	though	I	no	longer	knew	if	I	was	going	the	right way.	Every	landmark	that	I	knew	had	vanished	into	dust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	my	wandering	I	came	across	no	living	thing.	Yet,	the	dead	were	legion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hundreds	of	corpses	were	gathered	in	twisted	and	broken	heaps.	Charred cadavers	piled	high	against	mounds	of	rubble,	or	against	the	remains	of	some intact	structure.	They	were	all	swept	into	each	other’s	arms	like	leaves	on	a breeze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sometimes	I	stumbled	on	individual	corpses.	Many	were	no	more	than	charred husks,	the	carbon	broken	in	places	revealing	red	meat	beneath	the	crisp	shell.	At one	point,	I	found	a	body	that	still	resembled	something	of	the	human	form.	It was	charred,	but	the	carbonisation	had	been	perfect.	The	face	looked	up	at	me from	its	prone	position;	the	expression	on	the	face	was	still	readable	as	one	of intense	fear.	It	was	like	seeing	the	ink	on	a	written	page	when	the	flames	have just	consumed	the	paper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Later,	while	climbing	a	pile	of	rubble,	I	dislodged	an	old	door.	Beneath	it	was	a body.	I	slipped	and	tumbled	down	the	slope,	the	body	falling	with	me.	We	landed at	the	bottom,	the	corpse	on	top	of	me,	that	horrible	charred	face	only	an	inch from	mine.	I	threw	it	away	screaming	hysterically.	Even	today,	I	wake	up	at nights	seeing	that	face	-	and	it	asks	why	it	had	to	die. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“After	hours	of	roaming	the	waste,	finding	no	living	soul,	I	finally	came	across an	uncovered	entrance	to	the	city’s	underground	system.	Down	in	those	depths,	I finally	came	across	other	living	beings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dull	emergency	lighting	cast	deep,	eerie	shadows	over	the	listless	forms	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a>survivors.	Carefully	descending	the	lifeless	escalators,	I	made	my	way	onto	one of	the	platforms	far	below	ground.	Hundreds	of	people	were	gathered	there	for some	safety.	Isolated	individuals	like	me,	withdrawn	into	their	own	private worlds	of	horror	and	despair.	I	didn’t	see	a	single	soul	who	had	not	suffered some	kind	of	injury. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	stench	of	blood	and	even	burnt	flesh	and	hair	was	strong.	I	turned	my	eyes away	from	the	figure	of	a	child,	cradled	in	the	arms	of	its	mother.	Boy	or	girl	I couldn’t	say,	its	hair	was	frazzled	to	nothing,	the	skin	a	mass	of	ruptured	blisters that	glistened	wetly	in	the	light.	The	child’s	eyes	stared	into	space.	The	mother herself	was	badly	burned,	as	catatonic	as	the	child. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	stepped	over	the	body	of	a	man.	Dead.	The	corpse	glittered	with	glass fragments	embedded	deep	within	the	flesh.	How	this	unfortunate	got	there,	I	had no	idea.	Perhaps	he	crawled	in	agony	into	the	depths,	only	to	die	of	his	terrible injuries,	or	helped	by	some	lost	comrade.	All	the	same,	it	was	a	forlorn	sight, this	man	who	died	so	far	from	his	loved	ones,	alone,	in	this	forsaken	crypt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Blood	smeared	the	walls,	and	even	the	floor	was	slippery	with	it.	More	grim sights	assaulted	my	senses,	until	I	felt	like	Dante	descending	ever	deeper	through the	levels	of	the	underworld.	But	I	would	not	find	Judas	at	the	very	bottom.	Only cold,	manipulating	corporate	officials	lay	behind	this	inferno. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At	last	I	could	go	no	further.	I	found	a	clear	space	by	a	wall	and	slumped	to	the ground.	Surrounded	by	the	damned,	I	tried	to	shut	out	their	moans,	their whimpering,	and	their	pain.	I	knew	then	that	we	were	finished.	It	filled	me	with such	anger;	I	felt	I	would	explode	like	one	of	those	cursed	bombs.	There	was nothing	I	could	do.	Not	a	damned	thing.“15</p>

<p class="calibre1">UNDER	the	brooding	forms	of	the	nuclear	mushrooms,	the	Revolution	perished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	died	alongside	the	countless	men,	women	and	children	that	once	formed	its lifeblood.	In	the	name	of	democracy,	a	great	experiment	in	democracy	was destroyed	in	the	most	bloodthirsty	fashion,	by	the	most	awesome	assemblage	of military	might	ever	seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only	a	few	cities	were	spared	the	horrible	onslaught.	Cities	such	as	Firsthaven and	Trafalgar	where	Earth	planned	to	install	its	new	servile	minions.	Otherwise, the	destruction	was	terrible.	The	cities	were	flattened.	Industrial	estates	were reduced	to	so	much	scrap.	Agriculture	was	scorched	from	the	surface.	Millions of	people	perished	in	the	flames	of	Terran	wrath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	escaped	the	nuclear	attack	was	destroyed	in	the	second	orbital	barrage.	A conventional	bombardment	but	just	as	destructive	as	the	first.	Under	this	more people	died,	surviving	components	of	the	planet’s	infrastructure	were	destroyed, and	the	final	links	holding	the	Revolution	together	were	severed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fabric	of	the	proletarian	dictatorship	had	been	torn	asunder.	The	final threads	would	be	destroyed	almost	at	leisure.	With	the	nuclear	strike,	the	unified, central	administration	of	the	planet	was	brought	to	a	conclusive	end.	The working	class	no	longer	reigned.	Anarchy	and	chaos	ruled	over	this	once	proud, hopeful	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only	in	Firsthaven	and	Trafalgar	did	any	semblance	of	order	remain.	Here	were the	leaders	of	the	Revolution,	such	as	were	left.	Their	commitment	was undoubted,	but	there	was	no	longer	any	Revolution	in	which	to	be	committed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless,	they	desperately	sought	to	prepare	for	the	coming	invasion.	What other	choice	did	they	have,	even	if	it	was	to	hold	on	to	the	fragments? </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	over	Greyermede,	the	people	who	worked	so	hard	to	build	the	Revolution cowered	in	their	hiding	places.	Wounded,	ravaged	people	sought	shelter	from	the radiation,	from	the	bombing.	Defenceless	against	these	sorts	of	attacks	they watched	helplessly	as	their	New	World	was	torn	down	around	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">LIKE	a	pack	of	hyenas,	the	fleet	surrounding	Greyermede	closed	in	to	tear	the carrion	of	Greyermede	apart.	Scores	of	attack	ships	left	the	carriers.	Orbiting	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>ravaged	world	they	descended	into	atmosphere	and	plunged	groundwards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	people	were	forced	from	their	hiding	places	time	after	time.	Flushed	out	by a	rabid	enemy,	half-starved,	weakened	by	injuries	and	radiation	poisoning	the remaining	inhabitants	were	forced	to	defend	their	homes,	to	defend	their	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	was	left	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet,	the	Terrans	encountered	little	in	the	way	of	determined	resistance.	The people	were	too	weakened	by	their	ordeals.	They	lacked	the	means	to	order	the defence,	or	the	weapons	with	which	to	resist.	Any	mass	resistance	was	quickly crushed	and	dictatorship	resumed	where	once	there	was	freedom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Across	the	colony,	long-lived	resistance	fell	to	the	old	terrorist	groups,	or	to small	groups	of	isolated	revolutionaries	who	still	possessed	the	strength	to organise	and	fight	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Terran	counter-revolutionary	force	quickly	spread	throughout	the	devastated world.	But	around	the	Trafalgar/Firsthaven	axis	they	found	their	stiffest resistance.	Here	they	were	at	last	put	to	a	severe	test.	This	last	remnant	of	the revolutionary	order	was	better	equipped	and	better	organised.	Here	the	taste	of Terran	orbital	destruction	was	less;	here	was	the	old	heart	of	the	Revolution,	its most	fervent	defenders	and	its	old	leadership.	They	fought	a	most	determined resistance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Terrans	learned	this	to	their	cost	when	the	attack	ships	first	swarmed	into	the planet’s	atmosphere.	The	ships	assigned	to	this	sector	met	stiff	resistance.	Before even	they	poured	forth	their	battalions	of	troops	and	armoured	might,	the revolutionaries	attacked.	No	sooner	had	they	touched	down	and	the	defenders’</p>
<p class="calibre1">artillery	rained	a	heavy	bombardment	on	the	ships. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	shelling	was	merciless,	so	intense	even	the	armoured	hulls	were	no	defence from	the	explosions.	In	the	vicious	battle,	the	Terrans	suffered	their	only	real defeat	in	this	intervention.	So	angered	by	the	destruction	already	suffered,	the hastily	formed	Red	Army	was	barely	controllable	by	the	Revolution’s	besieged leadership.	In	any	case,	they	failed	to	prevent	the	massacre	of	every	Terran soldier	that	set	foot	on	their	territory.	Perhaps	they	never	really	tried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	so,	the	inevitable	was	only	postponed.	As	the	days	passed	and	the	Terrans swarmed	over	the	world,	the	Trafalgar/	Firsthaven	axis	was	surrounded.	With little	food	stores	and	dwindling	strength,	the	territory	left	to	the	Revolution	was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>slowly	nibbled	away.	Soon	the	battle	was	on	the	very	borders	of	these	cities themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	the	remaining	revolutionaries	there	was	nowhere	left	to	run. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	30</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	salvo	of	shells	blasted	the	streets	nearby.	I	hugged	the	pile	of	rubble	I	was hiding	behind.	Fragments	of	stone	and	brick	showered	down.	When	the	dust settled	I	saw	a	couple	of	my	comrades	sprawled	in	the	rubble.	The	grief	gnawed my	heart,	but	only	slightly.	I’d	seen	too	many	friends	die	over	the	past	few	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	while,	it	numbs	the	feelings.	Maybe	later	I’d	have	time	for	mourning	the fallen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	were	fighting	for…	for	what?	I	didn’t	know,	any	more.	There	was	no	longer any	democracy.	No	socialism.	It	perished	with	the	lives	of	millions	of	our comrades.	I	suppose	we	were	fighting	to	spite	Earth,	because	we	couldn’t	let them	waltz	in	without	a	fight.	We	still	hoped	the	Revolution	would	sweep	across the	galaxy	and	rescue	us	all	at	the	last	minute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Surrounded	by	broken	houses,	squatting	amongst	the	dead	and	the	dying,	with shells	falling	by	the	minute,	this	seemed	an	impossible	dream.	I	was	just	fighting to	stay	alive,	and	that	was	looking	like	an	impossible	dream	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Peering	through	the	smoke	and	the	dust,	I	strained	to	see	the	Terran	troops. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	out	there	somewhere,	slowly	advancing.	Scores	of	Red	Army	units had	been	flushed	out	already.	Where	the	resistance	was	too	stiff,	or	too	well entrenched,	they	called	up	gunships	to	blast	us	out.	We	had	been	slowly	giving ground	all	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	looked	down	at	my	weapon,	my	trusty	friend	these	past	few	days.	The	thing weighed	heavily	in	my	arms.	I	hated	it.	When	we	won	our	Revolution,	I	thought I	would	never	need	to	touch	a	gun	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Dave!’	I	turned	to	look	in	his	direction.	The	radio	transceiver	was	in	his	hand, offered	towards	me.	Quickly	I	crawled	over	towards	him,	keeping	low	to	avoid coming	in	sight	of	the	infrared	scopes	of	Terran	snipers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Hallo?’	I	said,	then	I	remembered	the	normal	mode	of	address	for	radio communication.	‘Fifty-first	unit.	Lieutenant	Carter	here.	Receiving	you.	Over!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	listened	to	the	garbled	communication	from	the	other	end.	Finally,	I	handed the	transceiver	back	to	my	radio	operator. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>“‘We’re	pulling	out’	My	expression	gave	away	our	orders	-	a	mix	of	relief	and shame.	He	nodded	in	acceptance.	‘Pass	the	word.	We’ve	got	ten	minutes	before the	artillery	lays	down	a	covering	fire.	They’ll	be	using	the	last	of	their ammunition,	so	we’ve	only	got	one	chance.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Leaning	back	and	closing	my	eyes,	I	listened	to	the	sharp	crack	of	gunfire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	the	distance,	I	heard	the	low	boom	of	Terran	artillery	shells	pounding	the city.	From	some	way	off	I	heard	the	scream	of	a	jet	engine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At	last,	I	heard	what	I	was	waiting	for;	a	high-pitched	shriek,	gradually	getting closer.	Our	covering	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Let’s	get	out	of	here!’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rising	to	my	feet,	I	turned	my	gun	down	the	street	and	opened	fire	blindly.	I	ran, the	survivors	of	my	detachment	following	and	firing	behind	them	as	they retreated.	I	reached	the	junction	with	the	next	street	and	looked	back.	Dim figures	began	to	emerge	through	the	smoke,	their	weapons	shuddering	in	their hands	and	spitting	flame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	Terran	went	down,	spinning	in	agony	as	bullets	penetrated	his	battle	armour, his	rifle	clattered	soundlessly	to	the	ground.	More	soldiers	appeared	from	the broken	shells	of	houses,	advancing	slowly,	methodically.	Then	the	shells	struck and	obliterated	them	from	sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	houses	erupted	in	fragments	of	broken	stone	and	brick.	Huge	splinters	of wood	went	spinning	through	the	air.	A	gunship	appeared	through	the	smoke,	its guns	blazing.	A	missile	left	its	underside	to	blast	a	ruined	house	to	rubble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several	of	my	fleeing	comrades	were	shredded	as	they	ran. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	ground	rocked	as	another	salvo	detonated.	The	gunship	disappeared	in	the blast,	only	to	reappear	once	more	like	an	angry	hornet.	But	this	time	it	slumped to	the	ground	and	exploded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	jeep	sped	round	the	corner	of	an	adjoining	street,	it	stopped	just	long enough	for	me	to	leap	aboard.	Other	vehicles	appeared	for	my	detachment	-	what remained	of	it.	Then	we	left	the	battle	and	all	our	hopes	behind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	dull	thud	of	artillery	reached	my	ears.	The	windows	rattled	ominously.	I	sat in	my	hotel	room,	back	in	Firsthaven	again,	and	tried	to	ignore	the	fear. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>I	only	ventured	out	into	the	city	a	few	times.	It	was	too	risky	to	tread	the	streets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	of	the	battle	was	concentrated	on	the	outskirts,	but	Colonial	Airforce	jets buzzed	the	city.	They	destroyed	in	an	apparently	random	fashion,	the	pilots confident	of	their	air	superiority.	The	outdated	anti-aircraft	defences	only managed	to	bring	down	a	few	of	these	swift	harbingers	of	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	city	centre	was	home	now	to	thousands	of	refugees	from	the	outskirts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People	driven	from	their	homes	by	the	fighting.	Shopping	centres,	hospitals	and office-buildings	formed	their	new	havens.	Even	here,	the	tentacles	of	the	Terran military	machine	reached	out	for	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Red	Army	was	fighting	a	desperate	battle	to	hold	off	the	Terrans.	Almost	by the	hour,	they	were	succumbing.	Firsthaven	would	not	remain	in	the revolutionary	hands	much	longer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	war	was	hopeless,	and	I’m	sure	the	revolutionaries	knew	it.	But	could	they really	give	up	without	a	fight?	Rumours	were	filtering	through	from	occupied territories	of	Reds	being	rounded	up,	of	mass	executions	and	a	host	of	atrocities committed	by	the	new	regime	that	was	forming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THERE	was	movement	in	the	streets	below.	Jeeps,	trucks	and	other	vehicles began	to	pass	beneath	the	hotel.	A	great	column	of	tired	looking	vehicles, occupied	by	tired	looking	men	and	women.	Hundreds	more	passed	on	foot, carrying	weapons	and	equipment	of	every	description.	The	Red	Army	was	on the	move.	Firsthaven	was	falling	before	my	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crowds	of	people	gathered	on	the	roadside,	begging	the	army	not	to	leave,	not	to abandon	them	to	the	Terrans.	With	shoulders	slumped	and	backs	bent	they couldn’t	comfort	those	left	behind.	They	were	going	to	Trafalgar,	to	reinforce	the resistance	in	that	city.	One	last	stand	before	the	inevitable.	Just	as	the	colonial regime	had	done	before	them.	And	behind	them,	the	terrified	people	just	cried their	grief,	their	fear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	couldn’t	watch	anymore.	I	left	my	room	and	wandered	towards	the	lobby	bar.	I decided	to	get	drunk	and	so	try	to	shut	out	the	terrible	noise	of	the	shelling	that continued	to	ravage	the	city.	The	other	offworld	journalists	were	gathered	in	the bar.	One	or	two	chatted	quietly	in	corners,	but	otherwise	there	wasn’t	much conversation.	Too	much	fear	filled	the	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	a	bottle	of	whiskey	in	my	hand	I	found	a	table	in	the	corner	and	sat	down.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a>broke	the	seal,	spun	off	the	cap	and	took	the	first	swig	from	the	bottle.	I	screwed my	face	up	at	the	harsh	taste.	I	can’t	stand	whiskey,	but	it	ends	sobriety	in	a satisfyingly	quick	manner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	half	an	hour,	I	still	wasn’t	drunk.	I	could	feel	the	warmth	of	the	liquor inside	me,	yet	it	was	not	having	sufficient	effect	to	shut	my	mind	off	from	what was	happening	around	me.	I	was	too	caught	up	in	my	own	thoughts.	Brooding too	much	on	what	was	happening	to	really	lay	into	the	bottle.	That’s	the	only reason	why	I	can	remember	the	arrival	of	the	Terran	troops. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	further	ten	minutes’	wait,	they	burst	into	the	bar.	The	soldiers	stared	at	us for	a	while	then	they	lowered	their	weapons.	They	were	suited	in	protective clothing.	Olive	coloured	NBC16	suits	covered	their	regular	battle-dress.	With their	faces	hidden	behind	hideous	respirator	masks,	they	resembled	huge	man-shaped	insects. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	soldiers	pulled	off	his	respirator	to	reveal	a	perspiring	face.	The	skin was	flushed	red	and	glistened	damply,	while	the	man’s	piercing	eyes	examined the	occupants	of	the	bar.	Then	he	spoke	up	in	a	calming,	but	authoritative	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	Captain	Faulkner,	of	the	Terran	Liberation	Force.	The	city	is	now	in	the hands	of	the	military,”	he	said.	“Is	everyone	all	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	journalists	replied	by	crying	out	in	joy,	several	rose	unsteadily	to	their	feet and	embraced	some	of	the	soldiers.	My	colleagues	behaved	like	rescued hostages,	when	not	one	had	been	held	captive.	The	forces	of	‘law	and	order’	had rescued	the	offworld	media.	Of	course,	they	were	all	right…	Now! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	31</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">WITH	the	fall	of	Firsthaven	only	Trafalgar	remained	to	resist	Terran	domination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	counter-revolutionary	forces	were	concentrated	around	that	ravaged	city, once	the	heart	of	the	Revolution.	Outside	this	battleground,	war	of	a	different nature	was	waged	-	counter-insurgency	warfare. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though	the	planet	was	all	but	conquered,	there	still	remained	isolated	pockets	of resistance,	and	the	old	terrorist	organisations	made	sure	the	new	Terran	military junta	could	not	relax	for	a	minute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	offworld	journalists	threw	themselves	eagerly	into	sorting	through	the military	press	releases.	They	were	particularly	looking	for	sensationalist	horror stories	about	the	Revolution.	They	found	plenty	to	feed	the	bigotry	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘chattering	classes’	across	the	galaxy.	Mass	executions	of	loyalist	militia.	Torture of	old	government	officials,	and	of	course	execution.	The	discovery	of	mass graves,	labour	camps,	death	camps,	the	works.	I	discovered	one	that	caused particular	amusement.	The	old	Mayor	of	Trafalgar,	Douglas	Morant,	was	found hanging	from	a	lamppost	on	the	outskirts	of	the	city	with	his	throat	cut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wrote	him	an	obituary.	He	laughed	when	I	handed	it	to	him	at	the	bar	of	this very	hotel,	though	I	wasn’t	around	to	see	his	reaction	when	he	actually	read	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	plenty	of	other	reports	that	were	most	likely	accurate.	Stories	of terrorist	attacks	on	Terran	patrols,	bombings	and	ambushes.	I	found	several alleging	outbreaks	of	cannibalism.	In	the	post-nuclear	waste	that	now	covered much	of	Greyermede,	I	found	it	easy	to	believe.	Food	in	the	city	was	subject	to rationing,	and	tightly	controlled	by	the	military.	So	too	was	water.	If	this	was	the situation	in	the	capital,	then	what	was	it	like	in	the	provinces? </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	no	news	of	Trafalgar	other	than	that	the	fighting	continued.	I suspected	the	Red	Army	had	broken	up,	that	only	local	factions	and	gangs	were holding	the	troops	at	bay	now.	There	were	a	few	reports	from	refugees	that indicated	this.	If	it	was	true	then	the	last	remnant	of	the	Revolution	had	been purged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	also	rumours	of	Terran	atrocities,	though	no	press	release	made mention	of	these.	I	didn’t	expect	they	would.	Plenty	described	routine</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>dispensation	of	‘justice’;	trials	before	fair	and	unbiased	military	tribunals, humane	executions,	all	reasonable	and	above	board,	but	none	of	these	reports covered	the	real	human	suffering.	Every	single	one	was	cold	and	clinical, brushing	over	death	and	destruction	with	calculated	corporate	double-speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet,	we	now	know	something	of	what	happened	under	Terran	rule.	This impartial	treatment	of	captives	was	anything	but.	Prisoners	taken	in	Gateway were	flushed	into	space	without	pressure	suits.	In	the	Galena	Valley	tens	of thousands	of	captives	-	Red	Army	and	civilians	-	were	rounded	up	and slaughtered	in	one	mass	execution.	The	bodies	were	dumped	in	a	disused	mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	Firsthaven	itself,	people	were	disappearing	without	trace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	all	of	these	horror	stories	mounted,	I	began	to	wonder	how	long	before	the military	came	after	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">AFTERMATH</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	32</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">IT	was	early	May.	The	Revolution	was	crushed,	but	still	Earth	waged	its	bitter war	against	the	people	of	Greyermede.	The	world	was	groaning	under	the	heel	of Martial	Law.	Not	that	of	the	old	Colonial	regime,	but	that	of	Earth	itself.	White hot	and	fresh	in	its	contempt,	and	in	its	anger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	every	face	the	Terrans	saw	potential	guilt.	Behind	every	pair	of	Greyermede eyes	they	saw	the	glimmer	of	subversion.	Fresh	from	the	field	of	conquest	Earth still	feared	and	mistrusted	its	vanquished	foe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	the	journalists	in	Firsthaven,	many	found	their	‘liberators’	were	now	their captors.	After	enjoying	great	freedom	of	movement	under	the	Directorate,	we found	ourselves	subject	to	even	greater	restrictions	than	under	the	old	Colonial Government.	For	days	we	would	have	nothing	to	do.	Kept	in	virtual	detention, we	were	anxious	to	be	let	off	the	leash.	But	that,	of	course,	wasn’t	to	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many	journalists	accepted	this	virtual	detention.	Contenting	themselves	with sorting	through	press	releases,	they	accepted	fully	the	framework	justifying	the media	restrictions.	Occasionally	a	select	few	of	our	number	would	be	allowed	to cover	some	story	outside	the	city.	Flanked	by	military	minders,	and	rapidly escorted	to	the	story	and	back	again	in	a	transport	helicopter,	they	were constantly	hemmed	in	by	a	military	authority	eager	to	keep	the	lid	on	the	real stories	unfolding	on	this	wretched	colony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	frustrating.	The	press	liaison	office	regarded	my	requests	for	access	to stories	coldly.	I	hated	my	captivity	as	intensely	as	I	did	under	Dutton’s	old government.	But	here	I	was	again:	in	the	same	room	of	the	same	hotel.	Someone had	a	sense	of	humour.	Black	humour!	A	lot	of	people	died	since	I	was	last	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	course,	I	knew	why	I	was	receiving	the	cold	shoulder	treatment.	I	was sympathetic	to	the	Revolution.	I	covered	it	favourably	-	but	fairly.	By	doing	so,	I earned	the	trust	and	the	respect	of	the	revolutionaries,	and	the	distrust	of	the military.	Now	I	was	an	undesirable,	but	the	junta	had	no	reason	for	kicking	me off-planet	-	and	they	still	felt	they	needed	one.	So	I	was	careful	not	to	provide any	such	excuse,	but	I	knew	eventually	they	would	find	some	way	to	deport	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	days	on	Greyermede	were	numbered. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a>In	the	meantime	I	consoled	myself	with	the	usual	dull	routine	of	sorting	through the	press	releases;	thousands	of	bits	of	paper	and	computer	readouts,	swamping the	journalists	who	tried	to	make	sense	of	them.	Occasionally	I	would	wander through	the	shattered	streets,	trying	to	dig	something	up.	Then	there	were	the verbal	battles	with	the	officials,	trying	to	persuade	-	or	bribe	-	them	to	let	me loose.	Sometimes	I	just	sat	in	the	bar,	spending	more	of	my	paper’s	money	on drinks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	lonely.	My	photographer	and	friend,	Chris,	had	been	kicked	off-planet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	found	him	photographing	‘sensitive’	military	operations.	What	this	meant	I had	no	idea,	but	he	was	gone.	For	the	other	journalists,	few	would	talk	to	me.	I was	the	‘commie’,	an	outsider	and	they	were	terrified	of	‘guilt	by	association’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	my	other	associates	-	and	friends	-	were	involved	in	the	Revolution.	And they	too	were	gone.	Either	dead,	or	in	hiding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">ONE	morning	I	was	in	the	bar,	the	day	getting	down	to	its	usual	routine.	It proved	to	be	different	as	a	commotion	from	the	foyer	disturbed	us:	a	man shouting	obscenities	at	the	top	of	his	voice.	Several	journalists	wandered	over	to see	what	was	going	on	and	I	followed,	my	curiosity	aroused	by	the	man’s	Terran accent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	small,	balding	man	was	being	dragged	out	of	the	hotel	by	two	grim-faced military	policemen.	One	of	the	press	liaison	officers	followed	the	trio,	while	a porter	carrying	the	man’s	luggage	brought	up	the	rear.	The	little	man,	whom	I vaguely	recognised	as	one	of	the	journalists	billeted	in	the	hotel,	continued	to scream	abuse	at	his	manhandlers.	They	ignored	him,	dragged	him	outside,	and roughly	bundled	him	into	a	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">David	Sanderson	of	MNN	was	standing	nearby.	“What	was	all	that	about?”	I asked.	He	turned	and	regarded	me	a	little	contemptuously.	I	could	smell	alcohol on	his	breath	and	he	swayed	unsteadily.	He	was	drunk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	deporting	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Deporting…?	What	on	Earth	for?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	caught	him	trying	to	elude	his	minders,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>It	was	amazing	how	one	word	could	completely	throw	him	off	track.	It	may	have been	the	alcohol,	but	I	suspect	the	question	would	have	had	that	effect	anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	brow	wrinkled	as	he	opened	his	mouth	to	reply,	but	then	he	failed	to	say anything.	Stammering	for	a	few	seconds,	he	at	last	found	his	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,	the	authorities	give	us	these	minders	for	our	own	protection.	It’s	crawling with	bandits,	terrorists	and	looters	out	there.	If	he’s	going	to	disregard	his	own safety,	and	maybe	that	of	others,	then	I	think	they’re	right	to	kick	him	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	you	thing	it’s	rather	convenient	that	this	protection	gives	them	complete control	of	what	we	see	and	hear,	let	alone	what	their	censors	allow	us	to	report?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sanderson	looked	irritated.	Maybe	I’d	struck	some	journalistic	sensibilities.	“Of course	they’re	controlling	access	to	stories.	Unless	they	know	what	we’re	doing, or	where	we	are,	how	can	they	protect	us?	There	is	matter	of	security,	which	we must	respect.	It’s	a	matter	of	co-operation	for	the	well-being	of	everyone concerned.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	the	well-being	of	the	inhabitants?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sanderson	opened	his	mouth	to	reply,	but	instead	said	nothing.	With	a	sharp glare,	he	turned	around	and	stomped	off.	I	heard	his	raised	voice	ordering another	drink	as	he	returned	to	the	bar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	seethed	inside,	though	I	don’t	know	why	I	let	Sanderson	get	to	me.	He	was little	different	to	most	of	the	others,	typical	of	the	media	would-be-celebrities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	accepted	the	security	blanket	that	allowed	who	knew	what	atrocities	to	take place,	because	not	to	do	so	would	have	endangered	‘our	boys’.	And	the	people of	Greyermede?	Forget	them.	They	weren’t	worth	considering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead,	the	Sanderson-types	preferred	to	be	seen	talking	with	the	troops	or mingling	with	the	high-ups	in	charge.	Good	for	their	careers.	You	wouldn’t	have seen	them	in	the	trouble	spots,	except	to	descend	like	vultures	in	the	aftermath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">AFTER	that	brief	exchange,	I	felt	I	had	to	get	out	of	the	hotel.	The	atmosphere was	beginning	to	get	me	down;	I	was	tired	of	the	cold	shoulder	treatment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside,	the	sun	was	shining.	It	was	the	first	time	the	city	had	seen	good	honest sunshine	since	before	the	bombs	fell.	Ever	since,	thick	clouds	had	choked	the skies.	Dust	and	ash	and	smoke	merged	with	the	great	vaporous	clouds	of	water sucked	into	the	air	by	the	heat	of	the	explosions.	After	a	week’s	heavy</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a>downpour,	those	clouds	had	broken	at	last. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	rain	and	the	brooding,	angry	clouds	sapped	the	spirit	from	the	survivors	as surely	as	radiation	sickness	sapped	their	strength.	Now	the	sun	brought	back	a reviving	brightness	to	life.	The	rain	also	brought	one	consolation;	the	radioactive fallout	was	mostly	washed	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	change	in	the	weather	brought	crowds	of	people	onto	the	streets.	People were	tired	of	cowering	in	the	gloom,	so	they	came	out	to	enjoy	the	warmth	of	the sun.	The	large	numbers	had	a	visibly	unnerving	effect	on	the	troops,	but	they kept	their	cool	well	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sun	glinted	off	the	glass-fronted	towers	that	dominated	the	city’s	skyline. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sky	with	its	collection	of	huge	cumulo-nimbus	clouds	was	reflected	in	the glass.	It	was	a	perfect	inversion	of	the	sky	above,	in	all	its	fiery	colours.	The coloration	reminded	me	of	Mars.	The	sky	glowed	a	dull	pink,	deeper	closest	to the	sun.	The	cloud	base	was	tinted	a	deep,	angry	red.	The	high,	billowing	forms of	the	clouds	faded	to	pinks	and	bright,	golden	yellows.	It	was	an	angry	sky, stained	by	the	fine	dust	that	still	floated	high	in	the	stratosphere.	It	looked	as though	it	was	smouldering,	ready	to	burst	into	a	great	inferno	at	any	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	great	barbaric	beauty	to	that	sky.	A	beauty	sourced	from	so	much ugliness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	city	seemed	at	peace.	Deceptively	so	as	the	aftermath	of	war	could	not	be ignored.	Despite	escaping	much	damage,	Firsthaven	still	bore	the	scars	of	its ordeals.	Terran	shelling	had	damaged	many	buildings.	Windows	were	broken	or punctured	by	ugly	bullet	holes.	Gashes	and	holes	in	the	sides	of	buildings formed	vulgar	intrusions	to	the	reflected	image	of	the	fiery	sky.	Many	office blocks	stood	empty,	looking	forlorn	and	gloomy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	fingers	ready	at	the	trigger,	Terran	troops	watched	the	city’s	inhabitants	as intensely	as	the	inhabitants	watched	them.	Both	wary	of	the	other.	As	for	the people	themselves,	their	faces	were	inscribed	with	suffering.	Eyes	were	deep pools	of	torment	and	ruined	hope.	The	people	were	fearful	for	the	future; whereas	only	a	few	short	weeks	before,	this	world,	and	the	future	belonged	to them.	Now	it	had	been	snatched	back	by	greedy,	bloodstained	fingers	and	all they	could	do	was	wait	and	see	what	their	lot	would	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wandered	through	the	city	streets	for	about	an	hour,	just	another	face	lost</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>amongst	the	anonymous,	tremulous	population.	With	an	almost	detached	air	I absorbed	the	sights	around	me;	damaged	buildings,	patrolling	troops,	military vehicles	rumbling	along	the	roads,	gunships	flying	overhead.	Despite	the	slight relaxation	in	the	tension	brought	about	by	the	welcome	change	in	the	weather,	I could	still	feel	the	intense	agitation.	I	could	almost	taste	the	dull	sense	of	fear and	apprehension.	I	tried	to	remember	the	feel	of	the	city	when	the	Colonial Government	fell,	but	I	couldn’t.	That	feeling	was	gone	forever.	Already	the Revolution	felt	like	a	dream,	and	a	nightmare	had	taken	its	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	about	to	head	back	to	the	hotel	when	I	remembered	that	I	needed	to	get	my press	permits	renewed.	The	permits	were	yet	another	way	of	controlling	the media.	About	once	every	six	days	journalists	had	to	apply	to	the	resurrected Board	of	Colonial	Affairs	to	have	this	renewed.	No	pass,	no	residence	-	you’d	be on	the	next	shuttle	out	damn	quick.	And,	of	course,	the	authorities	could	revoke these	passes	at	a	moment’s	notice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet,	we	didn’t	complain.	We	couldn’t.	One	word	of	opposition	and	our	passes would	be	revoked.	The	authorities	wouldn’t	mind	losing	our	presence.	It	would be	one	less	irritation	for	them.	Without	the	offworld	journalists	to	keep	occupied, they	could	merely	issued	press	releases	to	media	agencies	Earthside,	without having	to	worry	about	some	over-eager	newshound	trying	to	verify	the	contents, or	inadvertently	letting	the	truth	slip	through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	it	was	with	great	reluctance	that	I	headed	off	towards	Haven	Road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Commerce	Square	had	changed	since	I	was	last	there.	True,	the	fortifications controlling	access	to	the	square	had	not	been	replaced,	but	Colony	House	and	the adjacent	government	buildings	had	been	re-fortified	and	hastily	repaired.	The statue	marking	the	final	resting-place	of	the	Revolution’s	dead	had	been	smashed to	pieces.	Fragments	of	the	red	granite	littered	the	flowerbed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	walked	across	the	square,	doing	my	best	to	ignore	the	desecration	of	what	once witnessed	so	much	heartfelt	grief.	The	square	was	alive	with	keen-eyed	Terran troops.	The	buildings	fortified	with	sandbags	and	razor	wire	once	more.	My passport	was	checked	thoroughly	by	a	Terran	guard	before	I	was	let	into	the Colonial	Affairs	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	building	hadn’t	changed	much.	It	still	showed	the	damage	from	the fighting.	Windows	were	boarded	up	instead	of	reglazed.	Woodwork	and furniture	was	still	scarred	by	fire	and	bullet	damage.	Despite	this,	the	building</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a>was	operating	again.	The	bureaucratic	machine	of	the	old	state	had	been resurrected	and	returned	to	its	old	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Getting	the	permit	proved	to	be	the	usual	bureaucratic	farce.	I	was	sent	from	one department	to	another	before	I	had	the	forms	signed	and	countersigned.	But	at last,	I	had	my	pass	renewed.	I	was	secure,	well	relatively	secure,	for	the	next	six days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">ON	the	way	back	to	the	hotel,	I	encountered	a	patrol	of	Colonial	troops	gathered by	the	corner	of	Hawthorne	Lane.	I	could	hear	them	shouting	and	laughing	at something,	but	I	couldn’t	see	beyond	their	closely	gathered	forms.	Then,	above the	shouts	and	jeers,	I	heard	the	unmistakable	cries	of	a	small	boy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	numb	with	shock	when	I	finally	saw	what	was	happening.	I	watched	in disbelief	as	a	heavily	built	Sergeant	punched	the	child	in	the	face.	The	boy	fell	to the	ground	and	the	soldier	kicked	him	savagely	in	the	back.	A	wave	of	anger shook	my	body,	I	was	sickened	to	see	soldiers	laughing	and	joking	at	this spectacle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	a	rush	of	blood	to	the	head,	I	unthinkingly	pushed	through	the	soldiers	and screamed	at	the	Sergeant	to	stop.	He	did.	I	remember	quite	vividly	the	feeling	of icy	fear	that	rushed	down	my	spine	when	his	cold	eyes	locked	onto	mine.	The Sergeant’s	face	was	set	hard;	there	was	a	fierce	gleam	in	his	brown	eyes.	Behind me	the	other	soldiers	crowded	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Desperately	I	looked	around	for	help,	but	there	was	nobody	else	in	sight.	Then	I noticed	their	commanding	officer.	I	could	tell	by	the	blue	beret	folded	under	one epaulette	that	he	was	Terran.	The	young	man	slouched	against	a	shopfront	with an	air	of	total	indifference.	Hastily	I	pushed	past	the	Sergeant	and	kneeled	down to	help	the	boy.	He	was	weeping	and	an	ugly	swelling	closed	one	eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	the	hell	do	you	think	you’re	doing?”	I	screamed	in	barely	controlled	rage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	officer	continued	to	roll	himself	a	cigarette,	ignoring	me	completely	until	he had	finished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	martial	law	you	snoop-nosed	bitch!”	he	said	contemptuously,	in	a	North-American-Earth	accent.	“So	why	don’t	you	fuck	off?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	helped	the	boy	to	his	feet	as	the	officer	lit	his	roll-up,	a	cloud	of	smoke	floated away	on	the	breeze.	Then	the	Terran	looked	at	the	boy	and	me	coldly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a>“Why	pick	on	a	child?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	officer	shrugged	and	took	a	drag	on	his	cigarette.	“The	little	bastard’s	a looter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	that,	moment	the	boy	cried	out	as	the	Sergeant	pulled	him	from	my	grasp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get	lost	you	whore!”	he	snarled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get	your	hands	off	him	you	bastard!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	too	angry	to	be	frightened	anymore.	Foolishly,	I	reached	for	my	inside pocket,	for	the	credentials	they	contained.	The	movement	was	rather	too	quick for	comfort,	and	I	found	myself	staring	down	the	muzzles	of	at	least	five	high-velocity	assault	rifles.	I	backed	away,	my	heart	racing	in	panic.	Slowly,	very slowly,	I	removed	my	credentials	and	handed	them	to	the	officer	under	the distrustful	glare	of	his	men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	officer	studied	my	papers	for	a	few	moments.	Then	he	looked	me	up	and down,	an	expression	of	disgust	evident	on	his	face.	“A	reporter?	Should’ve known.	Who	else	would	have	been	stupid	enough	to	interfere?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	his	signal,	the	troops	lowered	their	weapons.	The	boy	was	staring	at	the	adults around	him,	his	uninjured	eye	wide	with	fear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	right!	And	I	happen	to	be	well	in	with	the	junta,	too,	so	I	could	have your	ass	for	this!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lies.	But	I	could	see	the	flicker	of	worry	in	the	man’s	eyes.	The	Terran	eyed	me suspiciously,	then	he	looked	at	my	papers,	and	finally	at	the	boy.	My	heart	was beating	rapidly,	and	my	breaths	were	trying	to	come	at	once.	I	had	to	fight	hard to	control	my	fear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mount	UP!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir!	What	about	the	looter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	officer	ground	his	cigarette	in	the	floor	with	a	brightly	polished	boot	and looked	down	at	the	boy.	“Screw	him!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	soldiers	leapt	aboard	their	jeeps.	The	engines	roared	into	life	and	I	watched</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>in	relief	as	they	disappeared	down	the	road.	The	boy	tore	away	from	my	grip	and quickly	took	off	in	the	opposite	direction.	“WAIT!”	I	cried	after	the	boy,	but	he was	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	this	was	the	sort	of	thing	happening	in	the	capital,	what	was	going	on	outside? </p>
<p class="calibre1">More	than	ever	I	was	determined	to	get	out	of	the	city	and	see	what	was	going on	for	myself.	But	just	then	I	needed	a	stiff	drink	to	settle	my	nerves. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	33</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	jeep	hit	a	pothole	at	seventy	miles	an	hour	with	a	particularly	bone-jarring shudder.	The	vehicle’s	suspension	handled	the	jolt,	unlike	its	three	human occupants.	I	had	confided	my	frustrations	to	Kate	McKenzie	and	Sean	Campbell, Kate	a	fellow	Martian	journalist,	Sean	a	freelance	from	Lunar.	Both	shared	my desire	to	leave	the	city	and	so,	together,	we	‘borrowed’	an	army	jeep	and	left	the city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	something	exciting	about	bucking	authority,	and	escaping	the	city without	official	permission.	At	first	it	was	touch	and	go.	Sean	displayed	a	certain flair	for	bypassing	the	computerised	security	system	on	the	jeep’s	ignition.	After that,	we	only	needed	to	negotiate	the	military	roadblock	on	the	M286	exit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	wasn’t	like	before.	I	didn’t	have	any	passes	bribed	from	the	authorities	this time,	but	bribery	proved	a	useful	lubricant	yet	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	leave	the	city	cost	the	equivalent	of	two	thousand	Martian	Yen,	made	up	of	a variety	of	Terran	currencies;	Japanese	Yen,	British	Sterling,	German	Marks,	and American	Dollars.	The	money	we	scraped	up	between	us	from	our	meagre	petty cash,	and	the	Colonial	troops	guarding	the	city	took	it	without	a	second	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	the	battered	Firsthaven	skyline	was	receding	from	view,	swallowed	up	in perspective	as	we	hurried	along	the	motorway.	This	wasn’t	a	repeat	of	my	earlier journey	to	Teliote	with	Chris	Harding.	That	journey	was	long	and	dull	with nothing	but	rippling	cereal	crops	for	company	and	the	occasional	passing motorist.	It	was	greatly	different	now;	much	more	depressing	for	one	thing	and much	more	lonely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	the	destruction	wreaked	upon	Firsthaven	was	shocking,	but	I	had	seen nothing	in	that	city.	For	the	first	time	I	saw	with	my	own	eyes	the	terrible	reality of	Uranium	Fist.	Those	cereal	crops	bordering	the	road	to	the	north	were	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kilometres	of	agricultural	land	lay	burned	and	barren,	the	crops	scorched	from the	earth.	Not	even	charred	stalks	remained.	For	the	first	time,	I	could	see	the distant	hills,	enshrouded	in	grey	mists;	the	blackened	plain	stretching	out	to	meet them.	Over	the	sound	of	the	jeep’s	engine,	the	wind	wailed	for	the	damned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clouds	of	black	dust	swept	across	the	windscreen,	only	the	wipers	keeping	the view	clear.	Spiralling	eddies	of	ash	whipped	across	the	plain,	moving	like	angry</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>ghosts	over	the	ravaged	landscape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes	we	came	across	burnt-out	vehicles.	For	the	most	part,	they	were agricultural	machinery,	but	occasionally	we	saw	the	vehicles	of	the revolutionaries’	last	defence.	At	one	point	the	jeep	sped	past	the	twisted	remains of	an	aircraft.	Too	small	to	have	been	an	airliner,	it	must	have	been	a	Militia	Air Corps	machine.	We	couldn’t	be	positive	though	-	the	craft	no	longer	had	any visible	markings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	motorway	itself	had	suffered	its	share	of	damage.	The	tarmac	and	concrete surface	was	cracked	and	broken	by	the	convulsions	from	the	bombardments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Craters	and	potholes	pocked	its	surface.	For	the	most	part	our	jeep	handled	the ruined	road,	but	sometimes	the	destruction	was	too	much	even	for	this	tough machine.	At	these	times	we	had	to	bypass	the	road	and	drive	on	the	blackened plain	beside	it.	Doing	so	was	the	most	nerve-wracking	of	times.	The	great	plume of	ash	thrown	up	by	our	tyres	must	have	been	visible	to	helicopter	patrols	for miles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	damage	wasn’t	the	only	thing	that	forced	us	to	bypass	the	road	at	various intervals.	Other,	more	grisly,	obstacles	choked	the	road.	Cars	and	trucks	were found	in	great	numbers.	Sometimes	we	came	across	these	vehicles	in	solitary isolation.	Burnt	out	and	black.	Metal	bodies	twisted	where	fuel	tanks	exploded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many	still	contained	the	rotted	remains	of	their	drivers.	Ghastly	near-skeletons, the	putrid	flesh	clinging	to	the	bones	like	melted	wax,	they	sat	in	their	vehicles as	though	stuck	in	a	traffic	jam	on	the	way	to	Hell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Conversation	ended.	The	sights	we	witnessed	suppressed	any	desire	for	speech. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	drove	on	in	silence,	until	Sean	asked	for	a	cigarette.	Without	a	word	I	placed one	in	his	mouth	and	lit	it	for	him.	He	grunted	his	thanks	without	taking	his	eyes off	the	road.	I	think	he	was	glad	of	the	need	to	concentrate	on	the	treacherous route,	but	I	doubt	he	could	fully	ignore	the	grisly	sites.	There	was	no	such	thing to	take	my	mind	off	the	destruction.	I	could	only	sit	and	watch	the	horror. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sky	gradually	became	darker	as	we	travelled	further	from	Firsthaven,	until we	found	ourselves	immersed	in	an	eerie	twilight	world.	The	sky	was	choked with	rolling	clouds	of	thick,	black	smoke.	Slowly,	the	smoke	thickened	until	at last	it	seemed	we	were	driving	through	the	night,	yet	our	watches	told	us	it	was only	two	o’clock.	In	the	gloom,	we	could	now	see	little.	The	vehicle’s	headlights revealed	more	pockets	of	grisly	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>I	glanced	around,	testing	the	extent	of	visibility.	To	the	Southeast,	I	could	see	a dull	red-orange	glow	on	the	horizon.	The	darkness	seemed	to	be	thicker	there too.	The	barrage	had	ignited	the	OlMec	Oilfields.	The	thick	combustion	products of	burning	crude	blotted	out	the	sun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	journey	to	Teliote	should	have	taken	two	hours.	Instead,	it	took	about	five. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	metal	ruins	blocking	the	road	hindered	our	journey.	The	destruction	was greater	than	our	worst	fears.	We	knew	the	devastation	was	terrible	all	over Greyermede,	but	we	had	no	idea	it	was	so	great	this	close	to	the	capital. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	failed	to	find	any	sign	of	life.	In	hope	of	finding	survivors,	we	drove	through the	ruins	of	previously	inhabited	towns.	Some	were	no	more	than	ruined	ghost towns,	but	others	were	littered	with	the	silent	dead.	Rotted	corpses	lay	in	the rubble,	eaten	by	maggots	and	oversized	rats.	No	sign	of	life	anywhere.	The Terrans	were	too	efficient. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	more	depressed	and	hopeless,	we	left	these	ruins	behind.	After	a	while	the broken	structures	of	Teliote	appeared	through	the	inky	murk.	We	had	little	hope of	finding	anything	but	corpses	here	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	34</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">MORE	nightmare	images	appeared	in	the	jeep’s	headlights,	but	we	were	used	to them	by	now.	There	was	still	no	sign	of	the	living	as	we	penetrated	deeper	into the	ruined	city,	yet	every	so	often	I	caught	sight	of	furtive	movement	on	the	edge of	the	light.	Too	dim	to	be	seen	clearly,	yet	bright	enough	to	know	that something	was	there.	The	brief	blurs	were	little	more	than	otherworldly; uncertain,	but	enough	to	raise	my	hackles,	and	my	hopes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	buildings	were	little	more	than	burnt	out	shells,	shattered	under	the	impact of	high	explosives.	The	city	looked	nothing	like	its	former	self.	Gone	were	the ordered	streets.	Gone	were	its	landmarks	that	would	have	given	me	some	idea	of where	we	were.	I	was	lost.	This	may	as	well	have	been	my	first	trip	to	the	city.	In fact,	I	wish	it	had	been	my	first	visit,	because	then	my	mind	wouldn’t	have superimposed	images	of	the	living	city	over	the	bones	of	its	lifeless	corpse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Was	it	only	a	few	short	months	since	this	city’s	inhabitants	overthrew	the government?	Such	a	short	time	before	that	it	was	gripped	by	such	dizzying euphoria?	Now	it	seemed	a	millennium	ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	huge	department	store	loomed	ahead.	The	structure	stood	open	to	the elements,	its	goods	strewn	over	the	rubble-choked	streets.	The	remains	of	the building’s	plate-glass	facade	glittered	in	the	headlights	as	Sean	drove	past	the ruin,	and	the	display	mannequins	watched	us	leave	in	eerie	proxy	for	the	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	road	opened	before	us	to	reveal	a	wide	pedestrian	zone.	This	too	was	littered with	rubble,	but	it	was	somewhat	clearer	than	the	rest	of	the	city	streets.	Perhaps because	of	their	very	narrowness,	the	other	streets	concentrated	the	destruction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	jeep	drove	past	the	ravaged	structures	of	shopping	arcades,	fast	food	outlets, and	the	odd	bar.	In	the	centre	of	the	square	stood	a	small	garden,	shrubs	and flowers	squashed	by	blocks	of	concrete	and	twisted	steel.	Out	of	the	garden	a tree	reared	up	into	the	darkness.	Scorched	in	places	it	still	held	a	few	leaves,	but these	were	black,	coated	in	the	soot	that	had	blown	over	the	city	from	the	distant oilfields. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beyond	the	square	our	jeep	rumbled	along	a	tree-lined	boulevard.	Bordered	with once-fashionable	stores,	it	was	now	a	barren	ruin.	The	shops	were	open	to	the elements,	roofs	and	walls	collapsed.	Not	a	single	window	was	intact,	but	mounds</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a>of	glass	fragments	could	be	seen	piled	against	the	walls,	like	great	lumps	of crushed	ice.	The	trees	survived	the	damage	with	little	harm.	Bark	was	charred,	or scarred	by	flying	debris	and	the	leaves	were	stripped	away,	but	still	they	stood	in defiance	of	Terran	malice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	end	of	the	street,	the	row	of	buildings	ended	in	a	huge	mound	of	rubble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blocks	of	concrete	and	mortared	bricks	reared	up	in	a	slope	against	the neighbouring	structure.	Huge	beams	of	splintered	wood	and	twisted	girders pointed	skywards,	like	a	tombstone.	Beyond	the	mound,	blocking	off	access	to the	next	street	we	found	a	wide	crater,	filled	with	water	from	a	broken	main. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	middle	of	the	stagnant	pool,	the	battered	wreck	of	a	gunship	wallowed lifelessly.	Its	hull	glistened	in	the	headlights	like	the	carapace	of	some	primordial hunter-insect;	its	rotors	buckled	like	the	wings	of	a	dying	dragonfly.	The	thing was	a	testimony	to	the	revolutionaries’	defence,	but	even	in	death,	the	gunship brooded	with	a	deadly	menace.	Sean	span	the	jeep	around	the	corner,	the headlights	swinging	away	from	the	gunship	which	was	quickly	reclaimed	by	the gloom.	Soon	it	was	lost	to	sight	behind	us,	abandoned	once	more	to	its	watery grave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More	destruction.	The	city	seemed	to	frown	down	upon	us.	It	was	a	chilling time.	My	companions’	faces	were	bleached	white	in	horror	and	I’m	sure	my	face matched	theirs.	Everywhere	we	journeyed	in	that	city	we	found	more	of	the same.	Ruination.	Death.	Hopelessness.	The	city	was	dead;	we	despaired	of finding	any	living	creature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“STOP!”	Kate	yelled	suddenly	as	we	drove	down	yet	another	anonymous demolition	site.	Sean	slammed	the	brakes	down	hard,	and	the	jeep	skidded	to	a halt	with	little	regard	for	its	human	occupants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jesus!”	I	exclaimed,	startled.	“What’ve	we	stopped	for?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	saw	something	out	there!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?	Where	was	it?”	Sean	asked	hurriedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	a	light,	it	was	moving	back	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kate	pointed	back	the	way	the	jeep	had	come.	Muttering	under	his	breath,	Sean reversed	the	vehicle.	He	stopped	about	ten	metres	further	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a>We	stared	into	the	gloom,	but	failed	to	see	anything,	just	more	rubble	and	ruined buildings.	Then	a	brief	flare	of	light	appeared	for	a	moment	before	disappearing behind	a	wall.	I	looked	hard	at	the	spot	where	the	light	had	appeared	but	again	I could	see	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There!”	Sean	suddenly	shouted,	excitement	in	his	voice.	He	turned	the	jeep around	so	that	the	headlights	bathed	the	rubble-strewn	buildings	in	a	bright glare.	Two	figures	were	revealed	in	the	light.	Two	women	in	long	flowing dresses.	One	carried	a	burning	torch,	crudely	made	from	a	few	rags	and	a	length of	wood.	Both	covered	their	faces	to	protect	their	eyes	from	the	blinding	glare. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	they	thought	of	fleeing,	we	leapt	out	of	the	jeep	and	ran	up	towards	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These	were	the	first	living	beings	we	had	seen;	we	didn’t	want	to	lose	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	three	of	us	drew	closer,	I	was	able	to	get	a	better	look	at	the	pair.	There was	something	wrong.	Then	I	understood	as	they	walked	down	to	meet	us.	They weren’t	women	at	all.	They	were	men.	The	‘dresses’	were	the	robes	of	Gaian monks,	green,	but	stained	with	filth	and	ash.	Both	men’s	heads	were	bare,	except for	a	few	days	unshaven	growth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	greet	you	Children	of	Gaia,”	the	first	monk	said	in	a	monotone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	we	glad	to	see	someone	alive	in	this	place,”	Kate	said,	breaking	into	a	grin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	there	any	more	survivors?”	Sean	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	second	monk	stirred,	as	though	he	had	awoken	from	a	trance.	His	grey	eyes stared	at	Sean	before	he	replied.	“We	are	the	only	survivors	of	our	order,”	he said,	“there	is	no-one	else.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	you	should	go	on	your	way	now,”	the	first	monk	suggested.	“There	is nothing	for	you	here.	Gaia	has	punished	her	wayward	children.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	mean	by	that?”	I	asked.	The	monk	looked	surprised	by	my	query. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Communists.	They	have	been	destroyed.	They	sought	to	take	nourishment from	the	Mother,	and	so	she	sent	her	warriors	to	punish	those	who	went	against her.	They	are	dying	now,	the	hive	is	being	purged!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	mean	there	are	others	left	alive?”	Sean	asked	in	outrage.	“Why	didn’t	you say	so?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a>“Yes,	there	are	others.	They	have	sought	shelter	in	our	temple.	Defiling	its holiness!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	is	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	pointed	the	torch	in	the	direction	of	a	building	at	the	end	of	the	street.	It didn’t	look	much	like	a	typical	Gaian	temple,	but	then	not	much	in	the	city looked	as	it	should.	Sean	had	had	enough	of	this	mad	pair.	So	had	I.	We	began	to walk	towards	the	indicated	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	cannot	help	them!	You	mustn’t!	Do	you	want	to	incur	the	wrath	of	Gaia? </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	this	is	the	Mother’s	will!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	I	replied	quietly,	sadly.	“This	is	just	the	will	of	a	few	power-crazed politicians	and	businessmen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	first	monk	grabbed	hold	of	Sean’s	arm	and	tried	to	keep	him	from approaching	the	temple.	Sean	pushed	him	off	angrily.	The	monk	fell	to	the ground	and	regarded	us	with	a	mixture	of	hatred	and	fear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	cannot	interfere	with	Gaia’s	will!”	the	second	monk	cried	after	us.	But	his words	were	ignored.	We	left	the	mad	pair	behind,	uttering	curses	and	vulgar deprecations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fragments	of	stone	and	concrete	crunched	beneath	our	feet	as	we	picked	our way	over	the	rubble.	I	pulled	the	jacket	I	had	found	in	the	jeep	tighter	around	me to	keep	out	the	chill	breeze	as	the	temple	loomed	overhead.	It	was	a	dark, brooding	form	that	seemed	horribly	lifeless.	As	we	approached	the	door	I	heard a	quiet	whimper	from	within,	and	then	I	saw	the	faint	flicker	of	a	candle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hopefully	we	passed	through	the	door	and	into	the	main	chamber. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	God!”	Kate	whispered.	The	chamber	was	poorly	lit,	flickering	candles casting	deep	shadows	over	the	chamber’s	furthest	corners.	Shadows	danced madly	with	the	breeze	that	filtered	through	breaches	in	the	structure.	We	ignored the	surviving	icons	of	Gaian	imagery.	They	were	lost	to	us	within	the	sphere	of human	suffering	that	spread	out	before	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	temple	was	filled	with	people.	Men,	women	and	children	lay	in	a	haphazard manner	over	the	cold	stone	floor,	or	rested	on	rows	of	crude	wooden	benches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	room	was	almost	silent,	except	for	a	few	groans	and	fearful	whimpering. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a>The	air	stank	of	human	blood	and	waste	and	decay.	The	human	smells	mixed	in a	sickening	aroma	with	the	odour	of	candle	wax	and	damp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Corpses	at	every	stage	of	decay	rested	on	the	floor,	so	close	to	the	living	it	was sickening.	How	could	they	stand	it	I	asked	myself?	But	looking	at	those unfortunates	who	still	had	life,	I	knew	the	awful	torment	had	caused	them	to retreat	from	reality.	They	had	no	awareness	of	what	went	on	around	them.	Shock had	numbed	their	brains.	Perhaps	they	were	gripped	in	some	terrible	waking nightmare,	a	mental	virtual	reality	in	which	they	constantly	relived	the destruction	of	their	city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	range	of	injuries	was	frightening.	Faces	and	bodies	badly	burned,	a	mass	of grisly	open	blisters.	Crushed	limbs,	gashes,	broken	bones,	pulped	flesh.	Horrible to	behold.	Many	were	covered	with	makeshift	bandages	-	torn	and	filthy	cloth adding	infection	and	disease	to	the	list	of	suffering.	I	saw	a	man	dully	watching us,	one	side	of	his	face	was	badly	burned,	an	eye	pulped	to	a	crusty	mush. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	rested	by	a	pillar	about	five	metres	from	where	we	stood,	both	legs	gone above	the	knee,	the	stumps	covered	in	stained	and	filthy	rags.	A	body	by	the door,	its	stomach	ripped	open,	exposing	the	entrails	and	crawling	with	bloated maggots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Resting	against	the	back	of	a	bench,	a	young	mother	sat	staring	into	space.	I couldn’t	tell	if	she	was	dead	or	catatonic.	Her	ashen	face	stared	at	the	wall opposite,	no	awareness	registering	in	her	eyes.	In	her	limp	arms	a	baby	rested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thin	and	shrunken,	it	wailed	weakly	for	attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	get	out	of	here…”	Kate	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!	We	can’t	leave	these	poor	bastards!”	Sean	said	angrily.	Kate	looked	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	scene	of	human	suffering	too	much	for	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	can’t	help	them,	Sean,”	I	said,	gripping	his	arm	and	squeezing	it	slightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	too	many.	They	need	professional	help.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	started	to	drag	Sean	out	of	the	building,	trying	to	forget	what	I	had	seen.	I	felt so	callous,	so	inhuman	leaving	these	victims	to	their	suffering,	and	to	eventual death.	There	was	nothing	we	could	do.	It	was	beyond	our	resources,	I	knew	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	it	didn’t	ease	my	conscience	one	little	bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	three	of	us	made	for	the	exit.	Then	we	heard	a	sound	from	the	door.	A	small</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a>figure	appeared.	A	young	girl.	Dressed	in	filthy	jeans	and	a	ragged	T-shirt	she stopped	short	and	stared	at	us	in	fear.	Her	face	was	white,	streaked	with	dirt,	and her	short	blond	hair	was	knotted	with	scabs	of	dry	blood.	Her	small	hands	held	a bulging	shopping	bag,	stuffed	with	food	and	medicines	looted	from	the	city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	a	gasp	of	fear	she	dropped	the	bag	and	ran	out	of	the	door.	“Don’t	go!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kate	called.	All	of	us	raced	for	the	door,	eager	to	catch	up	with	her.	Outside	I saw	the	girl	running	between	ruined	cars	and	up	a	pile	of	rubble.	Sean	raced	after her,	but	stumbled	and	fell	to	the	ground.	He	cursed	as	a	sharp	piece	of	metal drew	blood.	The	girl	disappeared	into	a	ruined	building.	We	had	lost	her,	but Kate	continued	to	shout. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Forget	it,	she’s	gone,”	I	said	as	I	knelt	down	to	look	at	Sean’s	leg.	There	was	a shallow	gash	and	his	jeans	were	stained	crimson,	but	the	wound	looked	worse than	it	actually	was.	I	tied	his	handkerchief	tightly	around	his	leg;	it	helped	to stop	the	bleeding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	the	wound,	Sean	was	still	able	to	walk,	albeit	with	a	painful	limp.	Kate returned	from	the	foot	of	the	rubble-heap	and	together	we	helped	Sean	back	to the	jeep.	It	took	about	ten	minutes	to	get	back,	carefully	picking	our	way	over the	rubble.	At	last,	the	jeep	was	in	sight,	illuminated	in	a	bright	sphere	of	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	else	was	also	visible.	Standing	in	the	light	were	three	figures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indistinct,	they	stood	in	silhouette.	Feet	apart.	Unseen	eyes	watching	us.	One held	an	assault	rifle,	pointing	in	the	air,	the	butt	resting	against	the	figure’s	hip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	held	a	machine	pistol,	resting	it	against	a	shoulder,	finger	loose	on	the trigger.	The	third	allowed	its	weapon	to	dangle	from	a	shoulder	strap,	hand lightly	clasping	the	pistol	grip.	All	three	exuded	deep	menace.	And	all	three regarded	us	in	absolute	silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	a	voice	spoke	from	behind	us,	“Shoot	them!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	35</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">TWO	more	figures	stood	on	the	rubble-heap	where	we	encountered	the	monks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	was	short,	but	well	built	with	long,	greasy	black	hair	reaching	to	his shoulders.	An	assault	rifle	dangled	harmlessly	from	his	shoulder,	but	the	man regarded	us	with	undisguised	hatred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	should	kill	them,”	he	said,	this	time	in	more	subordinate	tones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!	We	haven’t	the	ammunition	to	waste	-” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	don’t	need	to	waste	bullets!”	The	shorter	man	pulled	out	a	butcher’s	knife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Put	that	away!	They’re	not	Terrans.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	leader	stepped	down	from	the	rubble-heap	and	into	the	light.	He	had	dark, haunted-looking	eyes	that	were	set	in	a	gaunt	face.	Despite	that,	they	held	a wary,	intelligence,	and	what	I	hoped	was	a	residue	of	humanity.	An	ugly	red	scar traced	a	line	in	his	right	cheek,	forming	a	bald	patch	in	his	scruffy	beard.	He wore	the	filthy	remains	of	a	militia	uniform.	On	his	left	arm	was	a	red	armband, so	grimed	it	almost	blended	in	with	the	drab	colour	of	his	jacket.	A	pistol	was stuffed	under	a	webbing	belt,	ammo	pouches	at	his	hips.	As	he	walked	towards us	he	slung	his	machine	pistol	over	a	shoulder	and	slipped	his	thumb	under	the strap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Welcome	to	Teliote,”	he	said.	“My	name’s	Jimmy,	and	who	might	you	be?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">None	of	us	answered.	We	were	too	frightened.	Huddled	together	pathetically between	the	menacing	figures,	we	could	only	stare	at	Jimmy’s	companion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	mind	my	friend.	He	talks	tough,	but	he’s	harmless	really.	Now	who	are you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	name’s	Sean	Campbell,	that’s	Kate	McKenzie,	and	this	is	Sue	Reid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jimmy	let	out	a	short	laugh.	“See	who	you	wanted	to	kill?”	he	shouted	back	to his	friend	on	the	rubble-heap.	“None	other	than	Suzanne	Reid	herself.	A respected	friend	of	the	Revolution!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a>The	short	man	came	down	from	the	rubble,	his	expression	had	changed.	“Sue Reid?	Really?	I	read	all	your	stuff	in	The	Worker…	before…	before…”	The	man fell	silent,	his	brow	creased	with	the	effort	of	recollection.	Then	he	shook	his head	and	turned	despondently	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Follow	us.	You	must	join	us	at	our	camp.	It’s	not	far,”	Jimmy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	three	figures	guarding	our	jeep	came	up	behind	us.	Two	of	them	took	hold of	Sean	and	helped	him	up	the	rubble-heap.	The	third	figure,	a	woman	with	a blistered	scalp,	brought	up	the	rear.	As	I	stumbled	across	the	wastes,	Jimmy came	up	to	my	side	and	placed	his	hand	on	my	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	seems	you’ve	stirred	a	memory	in	my	friend	there,”	he	whispered	in	my	ear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	doesn’t	know	who	is.	He’s	lucky	in	a	way,	he	can’t	remember	what	he’s	lost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	tends	to	make	him	a	little	more	aggressive,	you	know,	the	frustration	of	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jimmy	looked	away	towards	his	friend	for	a	moment,	a	wave	of	sadness sweeping	his	face.	“I	think	he	was	a	communist,	before,”	he	added.	“Sometimes, in	his	sleep,	he	utters	things	I’ve	only	ever	heard	from	the	GCP.	I	don’t understand	it	all.	I	was	never	a	communist,	but	when	the	Revolution	came	we shot	our	officer	and	joined	in.	But	my	friend	there,	he	knew	all	about	it…	once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s	forgotten	it	all	now,	except	in	his	nightmares…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	dog	howled	mournfully	in	the	distance.	Jimmy	led	us	through	a	maze	of ruined	streets	and	gutted	buildings.	We	crept	carefully	around	a	creaking	office block,	its	upper	floors	were	blown	away	and	one	side	had	tumbled	onto	the	road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Office	furniture	and	sodden	paper	littered	the	street	amongst	the	broken	glass and	masonry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	tattered	escort	led	us	through	the	dead	city	for	twenty	minutes	before	we came	to	their	camp.	The	broken	facade	of	a	once	high-class	shopping	mall appeared	ahead.	A	hoarse	voice	greeted	our	escort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jimmy!	Brought	us	anything	interesting?”	The	speaker	appeared	at	a	first	floor window	and	waved.	The	woman	was	as	filthy	as	her	comrades.	She	too	wore	the remains	of	a	militia	uniform,	the	sleeves	ripped	out,	revealing	slender	but	grimy arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a>“We	have	guests!	Journalists!	Go	tell	the	others	we’re	coming	in.”	With	a	mock salute	the	woman	disappeared	inside	the	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	mall’s	doors	were	jammed	open;	the	glass	littered	the	marbled	floor	and scraped	underfoot.	We	passed	through	in	silence.	The	darkness	suddenly retreated	under	the	dull	glow	of	crude	torches	placed	around	the	building.	In	the centre	of	the	concourse,	a	fire	glowed	a	dull	orange,	casting	deep	shadows	over the	depths	of	the	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon	we	caught	sight	of	more	men	and	women	lounging	about	in	corners, watching	us	with	interest,	or	merely	sitting	by	the	fire	talking	quietly.	I	quickly counted	thirty	men	and	women,	mostly	young.	Many	wore	a	variety	of	civilian clothing,	but	several	wore	the	remains	of	militia	uniforms.	One	man	wore	Terran battle	dress	and	body	armour,	a	couple	of	bullet	holes	in	the	chest	testified	to	the previous	owner’s	untimely	end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Places	were	made	for	us	by	the	fire.	The	three	of	us	sat	down,	glad	for	the warmth	it	offered.	The	air	was	unnaturally	chilly	outside.	“Ishmael!	We	have	an injured	man	here!”	Jimmy	shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	thin	man	wearing	cracked,	gold-rimmed	spectacles	approached	and	kneeled down	by	Sean.	The	man	began	to	examine	the	gash	in	Sean’s	leg,	ignoring	his protests	that	it	was	nothing.	With	a	knife	he	ripped	Sean’s	jeans	and	coolly studied	the	torn	flesh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	too	bad,”	he	said,	“looks	worse	than	it	is.	Dirty	though.”	With	that,	he reached	into	a	grubby	bag	and	pulled	out	a	bottle	of	disinfectant.	Liberally pouring	some	over	the	wound,	and	then	onto	a	cloth,	he	cleaned	the	ripped	flesh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	gash	bled	again	as	Sean	winced	in	pain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	could	stitch	it	up	for	you,	but	I	think	it’s	best	that	any	infection	is	allowed	to seep	out.	I’ll	bandage	it	instead…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jimmy	approached	and	sat	down	beside	me.	He	stared	into	the	fire	awhile	in thought.	Nobody	spoke	a	word;	we	were	regarded	with	great	curiosity	by	the filthy	band	around	us.	Our	walk	through	the	ruins	had	left	us	dirty,	but	compared to	these	people	we	looked	like	something	fresh	out	of	civilisation.	In	a	way,	I suppose	we	were.	I	think	we	must	have	sat	in	that	uncomfortable	silence	for	a good	half-hour.	At	last,	I	had	to	break	the	silence.	I	asked	Jimmy	about	other survivors. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a>“There	are	others,”	he	slowly	replied,	his	voice	quiet.	“Even	the	Terrans	can’t quite	manage	to	kill	off	an	entire	city.	There’s	other	bands	of	survivors	roaming about,	like	us,	taking	what	they	can	find	to	survive	and	dodging	the	Terran patrols.	Most	of	the	people	have	left	though.	I	don’t	know	where	they’ve	gone.	I gather	it’s	pretty	much	the	same	beyond	Teliote.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	in	confirmation,	remembering	the	destruction	we’d	seen	on	our	way	to the	city.	“There’s	only	a	few	people	left	in	the	city	now,	mostly	those	who wouldn’t,	or	couldn’t	leave.	We	tried	to	help	the	survivors	at	first,	but	we couldn’t	do	it.	It’s	all	we	can	do	to	keep	ourselves	alive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	fell	silent	once	more.	The	fire	cracked	and	popped	as	sparks	were	carried	up to	the	ceiling.	Jimmy	stared	into	the	glowing	embers,	flickering	shadows highlighting	his	gaunt	face,	giving	him	a	sinister	appearance.	I	wondered	what he	saw	in	the	flames.	Family,	friends,	comrades,	the	city	itself	consumed	in	fire? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly	he	was	staring	at	me	again.	Anger	tinged	his	eyes,	even	while	his	face held	a	hopeless	expression.	“Why?”	he	asked	in	a	low	voice.	“Why	did	it happen?	How	could	our	comrades	have	let	this	happen	to	us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	away	as	a	tear	trickled	down	his	cheek.	I	had	no	answer.	I	had	no	idea of	the	mistakes,	the	inexperience	that	led	to	the	failure	of	the	Revolution elsewhere.	No	knowledge	of	the	betrayal	by	entrenched	labour	leaders	who talked	of	socialism,	but	preferred	the	crumbs	they	received	from	selling	out	the working	class.	Individuals,	who	procrastinated,	lied	obstructed	the	Revolution	in the	name	of	socialism,	allowing	the	capitalists	to	strike	first.	In	so	doing,	they abandoned	Greyermede	to	the	rising	storm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	others	in	earshot	said	nothing.	They	merely	looked	sadly	at	the	fire, avoiding	each	other’s	eyes.	I	wanted	to	ask	so	much,	but	my	questions	died	on my	lips.	In	the	face	of	so	much	destruction,	did	it	all	really	matter?	What	was	the quest	of	three	offworld	journalists	worth	now?	Would	the	galaxy	care	to	know about	the	suffering,	wouldn’t	it	rather	sweep	away	an	embarrassing	episode? </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	last,	Jimmy	spoke	up	again,	“Where	were	you	headed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Trafalgar.	Any	idea	what	it’s	like	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jimmy	shook	his	head.	“If	I	were	you	I’d	go	home	right	now,”	he	said,	looking at	the	three	of	us	in	turn.	“Go	home	to	Mars,	or	wherever	you	come	from,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a>get	the	hell	out	of	it.	There’s	nothing	left	here	now,	nothing	but	memories.	Take the	good	memories	with	you…	remember	the	Revolution	we	built,	but	forget this…”	he	finished,	sweeping	his	hand	round	to	indicate	the	devastated	city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	can’t	go	home,	Jimmy.	People	have	to	know	what	Earth	has	done	here.	We can’t	let	them	pretend	this	didn’t	happen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jimmy	just	shrugged,	then	laughed	quietly,	bitterly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">WITH	his	leg	tended,	Sean	could	walk	unaided.	Jimmy	and	his	amnesiac	friend escorted	us	back	to	our	car.	We	walked	in	silence.	No	one	felt	like	speaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	while	we	were	back	at	our	jeep.	With	one	last	warning	to	be	careful	of Terran	patrols,	the	two	men	disappeared	into	the	ruins.	They	were	ragged	ghosts returning	to	haunt	the	city.	We	were	left	alone	again,	surrounded	by	the	dead streets.	Already	our	discovery	of	survivors	seemed	unreal,	and	only	death surrounded	us	as	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	glare	of	the	jeep’s	headlights	I	looked	down	at	the	gift,	Jimmy’s	friend	had given	me.	It	was	a	dog-eared	copy	of	The	Worker,	dated	21	December	2238.	The cover	headline	announced	the	triumphant	proletarian	victory. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	36</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">TELIOTE	was	far	behind.	We	were	on	the	road	again,	racing	towards	our	final destination.	Around	and	within	Trafalgar,	Terran	forces	were	fighting	to	crush the	last	outpost	of	serious	resistance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually,	the	oily	clouds	dispersed	to	reveal	the	sunlight	of	early	evening.	The sun	was	already	close	to	the	horizon.	In	the	far	distance,	some	reflective structure	glinted	red	in	the	dying	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	engine	was	a	low	buzz	as	the	jeep	cruised	along	the	motorway,	the monotone	breaking	every	so	often	as	the	onboard	electronics	detected	the	need for	a	gear-change.	Another	ten	miles	on	and	the	road	cut	through	a	ruined industrial	estate.	On	either	side,	factories	and	warehouses	stretched	into	the distance.	All	ruined;	flattened	by	the	orbital	bombardment.	Miles	of	tangled	steel and	shattered	concrete.	Warehouses	were	little	more	than	skeletal	arrangements of	girders	and	scaffolding.	Trucks	were	burnt	out	ruins	in	the	remains	of	their loading	bays.	In	the	near	distance,	some	kind	of	silo	stood	rusting.	Isolated amidst	the	wreckage,	its	nearest	intact	neighbours	were	a	couple	of	cooling towers	on	the	very	horizon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	scene	changed	as	we	drove	by	the	remains	of	a	great	oil-refinery.	On	either side,	the	motorway	was	bordered	with	a	plain	of	tangled	pipes	and	tanks.	A forest	of	steel	blown	apart	by	high	explosives	and	reduced	to	little	more	than	a plain	of	tangled	metal.	Here	and	there	a	distillation	column	still	stood,	pipes	and conduits	severed	from	the	rest	of	the	plant.	Storage	tanks	lay	ruptured, surrounded	by	pools	of	unburned	oil,	steel	coated	in	thick	soot	from	the	burning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pipes	as	thick	as	our	jeep	still	straddled	the	motorway,	linking	the	two	halves	of the	ruined	refinery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	places,	the	ruin	still	smouldered.	Plumes	of	smoke	drifted	on	the	wind.	Tiny cousins	to	the	thick	cloud	that	dominated	the	distant	horizon	where	the	oil	fields blazed.	The	whole	place	was	a	smoking	memorial	to	Greyermede’s	petro-chemicals	industry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	ruined	industrial	estate	quickly	sped	past.	Soon	the	broken	structures	of Trafalgar	reared	up	on	the	horizon.	A	cluster	of	ravaged	towers	reached	into	the sky.	A	haze	of	dust	and	smoke	shrouded	the	city.	As	we	left	the	motorway, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a>ruined	streets	surrounded	us	once	more.	Houses	and	shops	pummelled	into rubble.	A	ruin	forged	by	the	hammer	blows	of	Terran	artillery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	artillery	could	be	heard	above	the	noise	of	the	engine.	Dull	explosions	from the	heart	of	Trafalgar,	plumes	of	smoke	and	dust	marked	the	target’s	destruction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Points	on	the	horizon	glowed	orange	in	the	dull	light	of	dusk,	as	fires	raged	in the	city.	In	the	distance	small	dots	hovered	in	the	air.	They	could	only	have	been gunships	rooting	out	pockets	of	resistance.	We	were	at	the	very	edge	of	the	war-zone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THERE	is	little	more	to	tell	of	the	events	on	Greyermede.	We	had	finally reached	our	destination,	but	not	our	ultimate	objective.	The	destruction	was	far greater	than	we	anticipated.	The	carnage	and	confusion	left	us	unsure	of	the	next step.	We	had	no	idea	of	how	to	make	contact	with	the	rebels	still	holding	out,	or how	to	avoid	the	military. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Surrounded	by	those	wind-swept	ruins	we	stopped.	I	killed	the	engine	allowing silence	to	fall	upon	those	ravaged	streets.	Kate,	Sean	and	I	climbed	out	of	the jeep	to	stretch	our	legs,	and	to	get	a	better	view	of	the	war-torn	structures dominating	the	skyline.	The	distant	sounds	of	battle	reached	my	ears	as	the sunlight	glinted	red	from	the	glass	facades	of	the	more	intact	of	Trafalgar’s buildings.	A	breeze	brought	the	faint	scent	of	burning	and	gunsmoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	I	caught	the	sound	of	rotors.	The	sound	grew	louder	as	a	gunship	became visible	from	the	ruins.	The	grim	looking	machine	steadily	closed	in	on	us,	until at	last	it	began	to	land	twenty	metres	away	from	us.	Terran	troops,	the mercenaries	of	a	hate-filled	ruling	class,	leapt	out	and	advanced	on	us,	weapons at	the	ready.	This	was	the	end.	We	could	not	escape	the	Terran	patrol. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	troops	disturbed	something	as	they	marched	towards	us.	A	bird	flapped madly	from	behind	a	block	of	broken	concrete.	My	eyes	followed	it	as	best	they could	until	it	alighted	on	the	charred	branch	of	a	defoliated	tree.	It	was	a	dove, one	of	many	released	by	the	revolutionaries	as	a	symbol	of	socialist	peace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somehow	seeing	that	creature,	alive	amongst	so	much	death,	raised	my	hopes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knew	then,	they	couldn’t	conquer	forever.	The	gravediggers	will	gather	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	next	time	they’ll	be	here	for	the	capitalists. </p>

<p class="calibre1">POLITICAL	ORGANISATIONS</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	following	organisations	were	some	of	the	more	important	political	actors	in Greyermede’s	affairs	right	through	the	revolutionary	phase.	Not	all	have	been mentioned	in	the	text	of	this	book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">BLACK	OCTOBER:	Formed	in	2238.	This	organisation	was	a	self-proclaimed socialist	party	(though	non-Marxist),	with	anarchist	tendencies.	Its	principle source	of	support	was	found	within	the	middle	class,	especially	students	and	the intelligentsia.	It	appeared	following	the	Black	October	massacre	of	2238,	when</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a>Terran	troops	slaughtered	protestors	gathered	in	Peterloo	Square,	Trafalgar.	It was	a	shadowy,	conspiratorial	group	renowned	for	its	terrorist	tactics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[THE]	COLONIAL	INTELLIGENCE	SERVICE	(GREYERMEDE):	The division	of	the	Terran	combined	secret	service	organisations,	dedicated	to intelligence	gathering	and	counter-insurgency	throughout	Earth’s	vast	territorial holdings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[THE]	COMMUNIST	UNIVERSAL:	An	interplanetary	organisation encompassing	the	major	revolutionary	and	non-revolutionary	left-wing	parties.	It was	formed	in	2105	to	aid	communication	and	co-operation	between	the member	organisations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">FREE	PEOPLES’	LEAGUE:	A	terrorist	organisation	that	emerged	from	the bones	of	the	smashed	opposition	parties.	This	group	carried	out	terrorist	attacks against	the	Colonial	Government,	and	later	turned	its	hatred	against	the	young workers’-planet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">FRIENDS	OF	EARTH:	Formed	in	2234.	A	front	organisation	for	factions	within the	political	elite	opposed	to	independence.	FOE	received	considerable	financial backing	from	a	number	of	offworld	sources.	It	was	dedicated	to	propagating	pro-Terran	propaganda	amongst	the	population.	It	proved	incapable	of	combating	the anti-Terran	sentiments	espoused	by	the	intelligentsia	and	the	media.	The organisation	collapsed	after	leaked	documents	revealed	the	sources	of	its financial	support. </p>
<p class="calibre1">GREYERMEDE	COMMUNIST	PARTY:	Formed	in	2215.	Marxist, revolutionary	party.	Affiliated	to	the	Communist	Universal	in	2223.	This organisation	won	extensive	support	and	membership	within	the	working	class	in the	years	running	up	to	the	Revolution.	They	then	formed	the	leadership	of	the Revolution.	It	was	destroyed	as	a	result	of	the	counter-revolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">GREYERMEDE	LIBERATION	FRONT:	Formed	in	2236.	Another	of	the middle	class	opposition	groups.	This	one	only	possessed	a	minority	of	support.	It was	dedicated	to	an	independent,	capitalist	Greyermede.	This	was	another terrorist	organisation.	Though	not	proved,	it	is	rumoured	to	be	responsible	for the	killing	of	Edward	Wilton	in	2238.	It	is	also	rumoured	they	had	Martian	aid	in carrying	out	this	assassination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">GREYERMEDE	MILITANT	LABOUR	PARTY:	Formed	in	2163.	The	leading</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a>workers’	party	in	Greyermede’s	early	history.	An	umbrella	for	many	political tendencies.	Because	of	a	split,	the	party	gave	birth	to	two	major	parties,	the	GCP</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	the	WDF.	The	ZMLP	lasted	another	five	years	following	this	split. </p>
<p class="calibre1">INDEPENDENCE	PARTY:	Formed	in	2233.	The	main	opposition	party	of	the colony’s	middle	class.	As	its	name	suggests,	its	aim	was	for	complete independence	from	Earth.	Initially	it	favoured	peaceful	means	to	secession,	but later	came	to	favour	more	confrontational	means. </p>
<p class="calibre1">ORDER	OF	GAIA:	A	semi-religious	body	with	only	a	minority	of	support	in	the population.	It	was	extensively	supported	in	the	early	trans-world	expansion phase	by	Terran	capitalists	but	abandoned	soon	after.	The	organisation proclaimed	Earth	to	be	a	‘supra-entity’	consisting	of	all	life	on	Earth.	Man	was its	consciousness,	and	its	gatherers.	The	capitalist	corporations	were	presented	as the	mechanisms	by	which	Gaia	gathered	its	sustenance.	It	was	a	complex argument	justifying	working	class	exploitation	as	a	necessary	sacrifice	of	the individual	for	the	needs	of	the	greater	organism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">OPPOSITION	COALITION:	As	its	name	signifies,	this	was	a	coalition	of	the main	opposition	parties	pursuing	independence.	The	parties	involved	were	all	of the	middle	class,	capitalist	orientated	bodies.	‘Extremist’	parties	were	not allowed	to	enter.	This	organisation	began	the	work	to	establish	a	Colonial Assembly,	but	its	aims	and	its	organisation	were	smashed	in	the	aftermath	of Black	October. </p>
<p class="calibre1">PATRIOTIC	FRONT:	A	neo-Nazi	group	that	gained	little	headway	within	any sector	of	Greyermede	society.	It	received	some	backing,	however,	from	Terran, and	later	colonial,	capitalist	and	government	agencies	to	combat	the	rise	of socialism.	It	was	broken	as	a	political	force	by	the	working	class	organisations’</p>
<p class="calibre1">resistance,	and	turned	to	terrorism	against	the	young	workers’-planet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[THE]	POPULIST	PARTY	OF	GREYERMEDE:	One	of	the	many	middle	class parties	that	formed	to	promote	independence.	The	PPZ,	however,	was	a	long-standing	party,	with	backing	from	colonial	capital.	It	received	a	massive	boost	in support	following	the	recession	in	2232.	Maxwell	Steadman,	one	time	pretender to	the	Presidency,	was	once	a	member,	but	later	switched	to	the	Independence Party,	which	he	helped	to	found. </p>
<p class="calibre1">PROLETARIAN	POWER:	A	minority	organisation	within	the	working	class.	Its</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a>main	area	of	support	was	found	in	the	grain	belts	of	the	colony,	from	the	rural proletariat.	The	party	had	slight	anarchist	tendencies,	but	worked	alongside	the GCP	in	the	workers’	councils,	and	in	the	workers’	state	that	developed	from these. </p>
<p class="calibre1">TRADE	UNION	FEDERATION:	The	collective	by	which	the	colony’s	trade union	movement	was	co-ordinated.	Every	important	union	was	federated	within this	organisation.	Following	negotiations,	the	TUF	joined	the	Opposition Coalition,	bringing	the	support	of	the	workers	to	the	middle	class	parties,	via their	respective	unions.	The	unions	and	the	TUF	were	officially	illegal,	but	they had	long	been	tolerated	by	the	Colonial	regime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">WORKERS’	DEMOCRATIC	FRONT:	Formed	2215.	The	other	major	workers’</p>
<p class="calibre1">party	formed	because	of	a	split	in	the	ZMLP.	A	quasi-Marxist	party	with reformist	leanings.	The	party	was	a	major	rival	of	the	GCP	until	it	outstripped their	support	because	of	the	revolutionary	unrest.	The	party’s	left	wing	worked closely	with	the	GCP	during	the	Revolution. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Biography</p>
<p class="calibre1">FOR	years	Mark	Cantrell	has	lounged	around	in	the	bars	and	caf�s	of	his	native Bradford,	searching	for	his	elusive	literary	chic;	he	never	quite	found	it,	so	he had	to	make	do	with	penning	poems,	short	stories	and	novels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	of	these	have	made	it	into	the	meme-pool,	courtesy	of	his	own	self-published	chapbooks	and	various	small	press	fiction	and	poetry	magazines,	such as	The	Asphalt	Jungle,	Sci-Fright,	Alternaties,	Decanto,	and	others.	His	work has	also	appeared	in	anthologies	such	as	Spirit	of	Darkness	(1998),	Love,	Sex, Death	&amp;	Carrots	(2000),	and	Sundoves,	Bumblebees	&amp;	Bluestreak	Bananas (2002). </p>
<p class="calibre1">These	days,	he	flits	between	Stoke-on-Trent,	where	he	lives,	and	Manchester where	he	works	as	a	journalist	for	trade	magazines.	He	has	also	written	for Writers’	News,	chronicling	the	activities	of	his	fellow	Yorkshire	scribes.	In	a similar	vein,	he	edited	the	monthly	Tyke	Writer	newsletter	for	three	years.	It gained	something	akin	to	a	cult	following	before	he	had	to	put	it	on	long	term hold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mark	studied	political	theory	at	Liverpool	University	before	training	to	be	a journalist	at	the	City	University,	London.	Even	then,	he	was	hooked	on	the literary	drug	-	so	it	took	a	while	before	he	finally	sauntered	into	an	editorial office. </p>
