<p class="calibre1">THE	ESSENTIAL	FALLACIES	OF	MALTHUSIAN	TEACHING</p>
<p class="calibre1">Section	1.	MALTHUS	AND	THE	NEO-MALTHUSIANS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Birth	control,	in	the	sense	of	the	prevention	of	pregnancy	by	chemical, mechanical,	or	other	artificial	means,	is	being	widely	advocated	as	a	sure	method of	lessening	poverty	and	of	increasing	the	physical	and	mental	health	of	the nation.	It	is,	therefore,	advisable	to	examine	these	claims	and	the	grounds	on which	they	are	based.	The	following	investigation	will	prove	that	the	propaganda throughout	Western	Europe	and	America	in	favour	of	artificial	birth	control	is based	on	a	mere	assumption,	bolstered	up	by	economic	and	statistical	fallacies; that	Malthusian	teaching	is	contrary	to	reason	and	to	fact;	that	Neo-Malthusian practices	are	disastrous	alike	to	nations	and	to	individuals;	and	that	those practices	are	in	themselves	an	offence	against	the	Law	of	Nature,	whereby	the Divine	Will	is	expressed	in	creation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(a)	 <i class="calibre4">Malthus</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Rev.	Thomas	Malthus,	M.A.,	in	1798	published	his	 <i class="calibre4">Essay	on	the	Principle</i> <i class="calibre4">of	Population</i>.	His	pamphlet	was	an	answer	to	Condorcet	and	Godwin,	who	held that	vice	and	poverty	were	the	result	of	human	institutions	and	could	be remedied	by	an	even	distribution	of	property.	Malthus,	on	the	other	hand, believed	that	population	increased	more	rapidly	than	the	means	of	subsistence, and	consequently	that	vice	and	poverty	were	always	due	to	overpopulation	and not	to	any	particular	form	of	society	or	of	government.	He	stated	that	owing	to the	relatively	slow	rate	at	which	the	food	supply	of	countries	was	increased,	a high	birthrate	[1]	inevitably	led	to	all	the	evils	of	poverty,	war,	and	high	death-rates.	In	an	infamous	passage	he	wrote	that	there	was	no	vacant	place	for	the superfluous	child	at	Nature’s	mighty	feast;	that	Nature	told	the	child	to	be	gone; and	that	she	quickly	executed	her	own	order.	This	passage	was	modified	in	the second,	and	deleted	from	the	third	edition	of	the	Essay.	In	later	editions	he maintained	that	vice	and	misery	had	checked	population,	that	the	progress	of society	might	have	diminished	rather	than	increased	the	“evils	resulting	from	the principle	of	population,”	and	that	by	“moral	restraint”	overpopulation	could	be prevented.	As	Cannan	has	pointed	out,	[2]	this	last	suggestion	destroyed	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>force	of	the	argument	against	Godwin,	who	could	have	replied	that	in	order	to make	“moral	restraint”	universal	a	socialist	State	was	necessary.	In	order	to avoid	the	evils	of	overpopulation,	Malthus	advised	people	not	to	marry,	or,	if they	did,	to	marry	late	in	life	and	to	limit	the	number	of	their	children	by	the exercise	of	self-restraint.	He	reprobated	all	artificial	and	unnatural	methods	of birth	control	as	immoral,	and	as	removing	the	necessary	stimulus	to	industry;	but he	failed	to	grasp	the	whole	truth	that	an	increase	of	population	is	necessary	as	a stimulus	not	only	to	industry,	but	also	as	essential	to	man’s	moral	and	intellectual progress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(b)	 <i class="calibre4">The	Neo-Malthusians</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Malthusian	League	accept	the	theory	of	their	revered	teacher,	but,	curiously enough,	they	reject	his	advice	“as	being	impracticable	and	productive	of	the greatest	possible	evils	to	health	and	morality.”	[3]	On	the	contrary,	they	advise universal	early	marriage,	combined	with	artificial	birth	control.	Although	their policy	is	thus	in	flat	contradiction	to	the	policy	of	Malthus,	there	are	two	things common	to	both.	Each	is	based	on	the	same	fallacy,	and	the	aim	of	both	is	wide of	the	mark.	Indeed,	the	Neo-Malthusian,	like	Malthus,	has	“a	mist	of speculation	over	his	facts,	and	a	vapour	of	fact	over	his	ideas.”	[4]	Moreover,	as will	be	shown	here,	the	path	of	the	Malthusian	League,	although	at	first	glance an	easy	way	out	of	many	human	difficulties,	is	in	reality	the	broad	road	along which	a	man	or	a	nation	travels	to	destruction;	and	as	guides	the	Neo-Malthusians	are	utterly	unsafe,	since	they	argue	from	(a)	false	premises	to	(b) false	deductions.	We	shall	deal	with	the	former	in	this	chapter. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	2.	TEACHING	BASED	ON	FALSE	PREMISES</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	theory	of	Malthus	is	based	on	three	errors,	namely	(a)	that	the	population increases	in	geometrical	progression,	a	progression	of	1,	2,	4,	8,	16,	and	so	on upwards;	(b)	that	the	food	supply	increases	in	arithmetical	progression,	a progression	of	1,	2,	3,	4,	5,	and	so	on	upwards;	and	(c)	that	overpopulation	is	the cause	of	poverty	and	disease.	If	we	show	that	 <i class="calibre4">de	facto</i>	there	 <i class="calibre4">is</i>	no	overpopulation it	obviously	cannot	be	a	cause	of	anything,	nor	be	itself	caused	by	the	joint operation	of	the	first	two	causes.	However,	each	of	the	errors	can	be	severally refuted. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>(a)	In	the	first	place,	it	is	true	that	a	population	 <i class="calibre4">might</i>	increase	in	geometrical progression,	and	that	a	woman	 <i class="calibre4">might</i>	bear	thirty	children	in	her	lifetime;	but	it	is wrong	to	assume	that	because	a	thing	 <i class="calibre4">might</i>	happen,	it	therefore	does	happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	population,	as	a	matter	of	fact,	does	not	increase	in	geometrical	progression, because	Nature	[5]	places	her	own	checks	on	the	birthrate,	and	no	woman	bears all	the	children	she	might	theoretically	bear,	apart	altogether	from	artificial	birth control. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(b)	Secondly,	the	food	supply	does	not	of	necessity	increase	in	arithmetical progression,	because	food	is	produced	by	human	hands,	and	is	therefore increased	in	proportion	to	the	increase	of	workers,	unless	the	food	supply	of	a country	or	of	the	world	has	reached	its	limit.	The	food	supply	of	the	world	 <i class="calibre4">might</i> reach	a	limit	beyond	which	it	could	not	be	increased;	but	as	yet	this	event	has	not happened,	and	there	is	no	indication	whatsoever	that	it	is	likely	to	happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Human	life	is	immediately	sustained	by	food,	clothing,	shelter,	and	fuel.	Food and	clothing	are	principally	derived	from	fish,	fowl,	sheep,	cattle,	and	grain,	all of	which	 <i class="calibre4">tend</i>,	more	so	than	man,	to	increase	in	 <i class="calibre4">geometrical</i>	ratio,	although actually	their	increase	in	this	progression	is	checked	by	man	or	by	Nature.	As regards	shelter	there	can	be	no	increase	at	all,	either	arithmetical	or	geometrical, apart	from	the	work	of	human	hands.	Again,	the	stock	of	fuel	in	or	on	the	earth cannot	increase	of	itself,	and	is	gradually	becoming	exhausted.	On	the	other hand,	within	living	memory,	new	sources	of	fuel,	such	as	petroleum,	have	been made	available,	and	old	varieties	of	fuel	have	been	used	to	better	advantage,	as witness	the	internal-combustion	engine	driven	by	smoke	from	sawdust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover,	in	the	ocean	tides	is	a	vast	energy	that	one	day	may	take	the	place	of fuel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(c)	Thirdly,	before	anyone	can	reasonably	maintain	that	overpopulation	is	the cause	of	poverty	and	disease,	it	is	necessary	to	prove	that	overpopulation actually	exists	or	is	likely	to	occur	in	the	future.	By	overpopulation	we	mean	the condition	of	a	country	in	which	there	are	so	many	inhabitants	that	the	production of	necessaries	of	livelihood	is	insufficient	for	the	support	of	all,	with	the	result that	many	people	are	overworked	or	ill-fed.	Under	these	circumstances	the population	can	be	said	to	 <i class="calibre4">press	on	the	soil</i>:	and	unless	their	methods	of production	could	be	improved,	or	resources	secured	from	outside,	the	only possible	remedy	against	the	principle	of	diminishing	returns	would	be	a reduction	of	population;	otherwise,	the	death-rate	from	want	and	starvation would	gradually	rise	until	it	equalled	the	birthrate	in	order	to	maintain	an</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>unhappy	equilibrium. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	3.	THE	ROOT	FALLACY</p>
<p class="calibre1">According	to	Malthusian	doctrine	overpopulation	is	the	cause	of	poverty, disease,	and	war:	and	consequently,	unless	the	growth	of	population	is	artificially restrained,	all	attempts	to	remedy	social	evils	are	futile.	Malthusians	claim	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">“if	only	the	devastating	torrent	of	children	could	be	arrested	for	a	few	years,	it would	bring	untold	relief.”	They	hold	that	overpopulation	is	the	root	of	all	social evil,	and	the	truth	or	falsehood	of	that	proposition	is	therefore	the	basis	of	all their	teaching.	Now,	when	Malthusians	are	asked	to	prove	that	this	their	basic proposition	is	true,	they	adopt	one	of	two	methods,	not	of	proof,	but	of	evasion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	first	method	of	evading	the	question	is	by	asserting	that	the	truth	of	their proposition	is	self-evident	and	needs	no	proof.	To	that	we	reply	that	the	falsity	of the	proposition	can	and	will	be	proved.	Their	second	device	is	to	put	up	a barrage	of	facts	which	merely	show	that	all	countries,	and	indeed	the	earth	itself, would	have	been	overpopulated	long	ago	if	the	increase	of	population	had	not been	limited	by	certain	factors,	ranging	from	celibacy	and	late	marriages	to famines,	diseases,	wars,	and	infanticide.	The	truth	of	these	facts	is	indisputable, but	it	is	nevertheless	a	manifest	breach	of	logic	to	argue	from	the	fact	of	poverty, disease,	and	war	having	checked	an	increase	of	population,	that	therefore poverty,	disease,	and	war	are	due	to	an	increase	of	population.	It	would	be	as reasonable	to	argue	that,	because	an	unlimited	increase	of	insects	is	prevented	by birds	and	by	climatic	changes,	therefore	an	increase	of	insects	accounts	for	the existence	of	birds,	and	for	variations	of	climate.	Nor	is	it	of	any	use	for Malthusians	to	say	that	overpopulation	 <i class="calibre4">might</i>	be	the	cause	of	poverty.	They cannot	prove	that	it	 <i class="calibre4">is</i>	the	cause	of	poverty,	and,	as	will	be	shown	in	the following	chapter,	more	obvious	and	probable	causes	are	staring	them	in	the face.	For	our	present	purpose	it	will	suffice	if	we	are	able	to	prove	that overpopulation	has	not	occurred	in	the	past	and	is	unlikely	to	occur	in	the	future. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In	the	first	place,	the	meaning	of	the	word	“overpopulation”	should	be	clearly understood.	The	word	does	not	mean	a	very	large	number	of	inhabitants	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>country.	If	that	were	its	meaning	the	Malthusian	fallacy	could	be	disproved	by merely	pointing	out	that	poverty	exists	both	in	thinly	populated	and	in	thickly populated	countries.	Now,	in	reality,	overpopulation	would	occur	whenever	the production	of	the	necessities	of	life	in	a	country	was	insufficient	for	the	support of	all	the	inhabitants.	For	example,	a	barren	rock	in	the	ocean	would	be overpopulated,	even	if	it	contained	only	one	inhabitant.	It	follows	that	the	term</p>
<p class="calibre1">“overpopulation”	should	be	applied	only	to	an	economic	situation	in	which	the population	presses	on	the	soil.	The	point	may	be	illustrated	by	a	simple	example. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let	us	assume	that	a	fertile	island	of	100	acres	is	divided	into	10	farms,	each	of 10	acres,	and	each	capable	of	supporting	a	family	of	ten.	Under	these	conditions the	island	could	support	a	population	of	1,000	people	without	being overpopulated.	If,	however,	the	numbers	in	each	family	increased	to	20	the population	would	 <i class="calibre4">press	on	the	soil</i>,	and	the	island,	with	2,000	inhabitants,	would be	an	example	of	overpopulation,	and	of	poverty	due	to	overpopulation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	other	hand,	let	us	assume	that	there	are	only	1,000	people	on	the	island, but	that	one	family	of	ten	individuals	has	managed	to	gain	possession	of	eight farms,	in	addition	to	their	own,	and	that	the	other	nine	families	are	forced	to	live on	one	farm.	Obviously,	900	people	would	be	attempting	to	live	under conditions	of	dire	poverty,	and	the	island,	with	its	population	of	1,000,	would now	offer	an	excellent	example,	not	of	overpopulation,	but	of	human	selfishness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	contentions	are	that	poverty	is	neither	solely	nor	indeed	generally	related	to economic	pressure	on	the	soil;	that	there	are	many	causes	of	poverty	apart altogether	from	overpopulation;	and	that	in	reality	overpopulation	does	not	exist in	those	countries	where	Malthusians	claim	to	find	proofs	of	social	misery	due	to a	high	birthrate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	overpopulation	in	the	economic	sense	occurred	in	a	closed	country,	whose inhabitants	were	either	unable	or	unwilling	to	send	out	colonies,	it	is	obvious that	general	poverty	and	misery	would	result.	This	 <i class="calibre4">might</i>	happen	in	small islands,	but	it	is	of	greater	interest	to	know	what	does	happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	5.	NO	EVIDENCE	OF	OVERPOPULATION</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	a	closed	country,	producing	all	its	own	necessities	of	life	and	incapable	of expansion,	a	high	birthrate	would	eventually	increase	the	struggle	for	existence</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>and	would	lead	to	overpopulation,	always	provided	that,	firstly,	the	high	birthrate is	accompanied	by	a	low	death-rate,	and	secondly,	that	the	high	birthrate	is maintained.	For	example,	although	a	birthrate	was	high,	a	population	would	not increase	in	numbers	if	the	death-rate	was	equally	high.	Therefore,	a	high birthrate	does	not	of	necessity	imply	that	population	will	be	increased	or	that overpopulation	will	occur.	Again,	if	the	birthrate	fell	as	the	population	increased, the	danger	of	overpopulation	would	be	avoided	without	the	aid	of	a	high	death-rate.	For	a	moment,	however,	let	us	assume	that	the	Malthusian	premise	is correct,	that	a	high	birthrate	has	led	to	overpopulation,	and	that	the	struggle	for existence	has	therefore	increased.	Then	obviously	the	death-rate	would	rise;	the effect	of	the	high	birthrate	would	be	neutralised;	and	beyond	a	certain	point neither	the	population	nor	the	struggle	for	existence	could	be	further	increased. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	these	grounds	Neo-Malthusians	argue	that	birth-control	is	necessary precisely	to	obviate	that	cruel	device	whereby	Nature	strives	to	restore	the balance	upset	by	a	reckless	increase	of	births;	and	that	the	only	alternative	to frequent	and	premature	deaths	is	regulation	of	the	source	of	life.	As	a	corollary to	this	proposition	they	claim	that,	if	the	death-rate	be	reduced,	a	country	is bound	to	become	overpopulated	unless	the	births	are	artificially	controlled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fortunately	it	is	possible	to	test	the	truth	of	this	corollary,	because	certain definite	observations	on	this	very	point	have	been	recorded.	These	observations do	not	support	the	argument	of	birth	controllers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(a)	 <i class="calibre4">In	the	Suez	Canal	Zone</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	Suez	Canal	Zone	there	was	a	high	death-rate	chiefly	owing	to	fever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">According	to	Malthus	it	would	have	been	a	great	mistake	to	lower	this	death-rate,	because,	if	social	conditions	were	improved,	the	population	would	rapidly increase	and	exceed	the	resources	of	the	country.	Now,	in	fact,	the	social conditions	were	improved,	the	death-rate	was	lowered,	and	the	subsequent events,	utterly	refuting	the	above	contention,	are	thus	noted	by	Dr.	Halford	Ross, who	was	medical	officer	in	that	region:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“During	the	years	1901	to	1910,	health	measures	in	this	zone	produced	a very	considerable	fall	in	the	death-rate,	from	30.2	per	thousand	to 19.6	per	thousand;	the	infant	mortality	was	also	reduced	very	greatly, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>and	it	was	expected	that,	after	a	lapse	of	time,	the	reduction	of	the death-rate	would	result	in	a	rise	of	the	birthrate,	and	a corresponding	increase	of	the	population.  <i class="calibre4">But	such	was	not	the	case</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	death-rate	fell,	the	birthrate	fell	too,	and	the	number	of	the population	remained	the	same	as	before,	even	after	nearly	a	decade	had passed,	and	notwithstanding	the	fact	that	the	whole	district	had	become much	healthier,	and	one	town,	Port	Said,	was	converted	from	an unhealthy,	fever-stricken	place	into	a	seaside	health	resort.”	[6]</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover,	Dr.	Halford	Ross	has	told	me	that	artificial	birth	control	was	not practised	in	this	region,	and	played	no	part	in	maintaining	a	stationary population.	The	majority	of	the	people	were	strict	Mohammedans,	amongst whom	the	practice	of	birth	control	is	forbidden	by	the	Koran. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(b)	 <i class="calibre4">In	“Closed	Countries”	like	Japan</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">But	a	much	more	striking	example	of	the	population	in	a	closed	country remaining	stationary	without	the	practice	of	birth	control,	thus	refuting	the contention	of	our	birth	controllers,	is	to	be	found	in	their	own	periodical,  <i class="calibre4">The</i> <i class="calibre4">Malthusian</i>.	[7]	It	would	appear	that	in	Japan	from	1723	to	1846	the	population remained	almost	stationary,	only	increasing	from	26,065,422	to	26,907,625.	In 1867	the	Shogunate	was	abolished,	the	Emperor	was	restored,	and	Japan	began to	be	a	civilised	power.	Now	from	1872	the	population	increased	by	10,649,990</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	twenty-seven	years,	and	“during	the	period	between	1897	and	1907	the population	received	an	increment	of	11.6	per	cent.,	whereas	the	food-producing area	increased	by	only	4.4	per	cent….	According	to	Professor	Morimoro,	the cost	of	living	is	now	so	high	in	Japan	that	98	per	cent,	of	the	people	do	not	get enough	to	eat.”	From	these	facts	certain	obvious	deductions	may	be	made.	So long	as	Japan	was	a	closed	country	her	population	remained	stationary.	When she	became	a	civilised	industrial	power	the	mass	of	her	people	became	poorer, the	birthrate	rose,	and	the	population	increased,	this	last	result	being	the	real problem	to-day	in	the	Far	East.	In	face	of	these	facts	it	is	sheer	comedy	to	learn that	our	Malthusians	are	sending	a	woman	to	preach	birth	control	amongst	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>Japanese!	Do	they	really	believe	that	for	over	a	hundred	years	Japan,	unlike	most semi-barbaric	countries,	practised	birth	control,	and	that	when	she	became civilised	she	refused,	unlike	most	civilised	countries,	to	continue	this	practice? </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	is	surely	a	limit	to	human	credulity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	truth	appears	to	be	that	in	closed	countries	the	population	remains	more	or less	stationary,	that	Nature	herself	checks	the	birthrate	without	the	aid	of artificial	birth	control,	and	that	birthrates	and	death-rates	are	independently related	to	the	means	of	subsistence. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	6.	A	NATURAL	LAW	CHECKING	FERTILITY</p>
<p class="calibre1">During	the	past	century	the	population	of	Europe	increased	by	about 160,000,000,	but	it	is	utterly	unreasonable	to	assume	that	this	rate	of	increase will	be	maintained	during	the	present	century.	It	would	be	as	sensible	to	argue that	because	a	child	is	four	feet	high	at	the	age	of	ten	he	will	be	eight	feet	high	at the	age	of	twenty.	Moreover,	there	is	evidence	that,	apart	altogether	from	vice, the	fertility	of	a	nation	is	reduced	at	every	step	in	civilisation.	The	cause	of	this reduction	in	fertility	is	unknown.	It	is	probably	a	reaction	to	many	complex influences,	and	possibly	associated	with	the	vast	growth	of	great	cities.	This decline	in	the	fertility	of	a	community	is	a	natural	protection	against	the possibility	of	overpopulation;	but,	on	the	other	hand,	there	is	a	point	beyond which	any	further	decline	in	fertility	will	bring	a	community	within	sight	of depopulation	and	of	extinction. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	7.	OVERPOPULATION	IN	THE	FUTURE</p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	a	fallacy	to	say	that	overpopulation	is	the	cause	of	poverty	and	disease,	and that	for	the	simple	reason	that	overpopulation	has	not	yet	occurred.	For	the growth	of	a	nation	we	assume	that	the	birthrate	should	exceed	the	death-rate	by from	10	to	20	per	thousand,	and	it	is	obvious	that	in	a	 <i class="calibre4">closed</i>	country	the	evil	of overpopulation	might	appear	in	a	comparatively	short	time.	The	natural	remedies in	the	past	have	been	emigration	and	colonisation.	According	to	the	birth controllers	these	remedies	are	only	temporary,	because	sooner	or	later	all colonies	and	eventually	the	earth	itself	will	be	overpopulated.	At	the	British Association	Meeting	in	1890	the	population	of	the	earth	was	said	to	be	1,500</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>millions,	and	it	was	calculated	that	only	6,000	millions	could	live	on	the	earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	means	that	if	the	birthrate	throughout	the	world	exceeded	the	death-rate	by only	8	per	thousand,	the	earth	would	be	overpopulated	within	200	years.	It	is probable	that	in	these	calculations	the	capacity	of	the	earth	to	sustain	human	life has	been	underestimated;	that	the	earth	could	support	not	four	times	but	sixteen times	its	present	population;	and	that	the	latter	figure	could	be	still	further increased	by	the	progress	of	inventions.	But,	apart	altogether	from	the	accuracy of	these	figures,	the	danger	of	overpopulation	is	nothing	more	or	less	than	a myth.	Indeed,	the	end	of	the	world,	a	philosophic	and	scientific	certitude,	is	a more	imminent	event	than	its	overpopulation. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	8.	HOW	NATIONS	HAVE	PERISHED</p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	speculating	on	what	might	happen	in	the	future,	it	is	well	to	recollect what	has	happened	in	the	past.	The	earth	has	been	inhabited	for	thousands	of years,	and	modern	research	has	revealed	the	remains	of	many	ancient civilisations	that	have	perished.	For	example,	there	were	the	great	nations	of Cambodia	and	of	Guatemala.	In	Crete,	about	2000	B.C.,	there	existed	a civilisation	where	women	were	dressed	as	are	this	evening	the	women	of London	and	Paris.	That	civilisation	perished,	and	even	its	language	cannot	now be	deciphered.	Why	did	these	civilisations	perish?	Surely	this	momentous question	should	take	precedence	over	barren	discussions	as	to	whether	there	will be	sufficient	food	on	the	land	or	in	the	sea	for	the	inhabitants	of	the	world	in	200</p>
<p class="calibre1">years’	time.	How	came	it	about	that	these	ancient	nations	did	not	double	their numbers	every	fifty	years	and	fill	up	the	earth	long	ago? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	answer	is	that	they	were	overcome	and	annihilated	by	the	incidence	of	one or	other	of	two	dangers	that	threaten	every	civilisation,	including	our	own.	These dangers	are	certain	physical	and	moral	catastrophes,	against	which	there	is	only one	form	of	natural	insurance,	namely,	a	birthrate	that	adequately	exceeds	the death-rate.	They	help	to	illustrate	further	the	fallacy	of	the	overpopulation	scare. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	following	is	a	general	outline	of	these	dangers,	and	in	a	later	chapter	(p.	70) (see	[Reference:	Dangers])	I	shall	quote	an	example	of	how	they	have	operated in	the	past. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>Section	9.	PHYSICAL	CATASTROPHES</p>
<p class="calibre1">Deaths	from	famine,	floods,	earthquakes,	and	volcanic	eruptions	are	confined	to comparatively	small	areas,	and	the	two	physical	catastrophes	that	may	seriously threaten	a	civilisation	may	be	reduced	to	endemic	disease	and	war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(a)	 <i class="calibre4">Disease</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Disease,	in	the	form	of	malaria,	contributed	to	the	fall	of	ancient	Greece	and Rome.	In	the	fourteenth	century	25,000,000	people,	one-quarter	of	the population	of	Europe,	were	exterminated	by	plague,	the	“Black	Death,”	and	in the	sixteenth	century	smallpox	depopulated	Spanish	America.	Although	these particular	diseases	have	lost	much	of	their	power	owing	to	the	progress	of medical	science,	we	have	no	right	to	assume	that	disease	in	general	has	been conquered	by	our	civilisation,	or	that	a	new	pestilence	may	not	appear.	On	the contrary,	in	1805,	a	new	disease,	spotted	fever,	appeared	in	Geneva,	and	within half	a	century	had	become	endemic	throughout	Europe	and	America.	Of	this fever	during	the	Great	War	the	late	Sir	William	Osler	wrote:	“In	cerebro-spinal fever	we	may	be	witnessing	the	struggle	of	a	new	disease	to	win	a	place	among the	great	epidemics	of	the	world.”	There	was	a	mystery	about	this	disease, because,	although	unknown	in	the	Arctic	Circle,	it	appeared	in	temperate climates	during	the	coldest	months	of	the	year.	As	I	was	able	to	prove	in	1915, </p>
<p class="calibre1">[8]	it	is	a	disease	of	civilisation.	I	found	that	the	causal	organism	was	killed	in thirty	minutes	by	a	temperature	of	62�F.	It	was	thus	obvious	that	infection could	never	be	carried	by	cold	air.	But	in	overcrowded	rooms	where	windows are	closed,	and	the	temperature	of	warm,	impure,	saturated	air	was	raised	by	the natural	heat	of	the	body	to	80�F	or	over,	the	life	of	the	microorganism,	expelled from	the	mouths	of	infected	people	during	the	act	of	coughing,	was	prolonged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Infection	is	thus	carried	from	one	person	to	another	by	warm	currents	of	moving air,	and	at	the	same	time	resistance	against	the	disease	is	lowered.	Cold	air	kills the	organism,	but	cold	weather	favours	the	disease.	In	that	paradox	the	aetiology of	cerebro-spinal	fever	became	as	clear	as	the	means	of	prevention.	The	story	of spotted	fever	reveals	the	forces	of	nature	fighting	against	the	disease	at	every turn,	and	implacably	opposed	to	its	existence,	while	man	alone,	of	his	own	will and	folly,	harbours	infection	and	creates	the	only	conditions	under	which	the malady	can	appear.	For	example,	during	two	consecutive	winters	cerebro-spinal fever	had	appeared	in	barracks	capable	of	housing	2,000	men.	A	simple	and effective	method	of	ventilation	was	then	introduced.	From	that	day	to	this	not	a single	case	of	cerebro-spinal	fever	has	occurred	in	these	barracks,	although	there</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>have	been	outbreaks	of	this	disease	in	the	town	in	which	the	barracks	are situated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	are	many	other	diseases	peculiar	to	civilisation,	and	concerning	the wherefore	and	the	why	an	apposite	passage	occurs	in	the	works	of	Sir	William Gull. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Causes	affecting	health	and	shortening	life	may	be	inappreciable	in the	individual,	but	sufficiently	obvious	when	their	effect	is multiplied	a	thousandfold.	If	the	conditions	of	society	render	us liable	to	many	diseases,	they	in	return	enable	us	to	establish	the general	laws	of	life	and	health,	a	knowledge	of	which	soon	becomes	a distributive	blessing.	The	cure	of	individual	diseases,	whilst	we	leave open	the	dark	fountains	from	which	they	spring,	is	to	labour	like Sisyphus,	and	have	our	work	continually	returning	upon	our	hands.	And, again,	there	are	diseases	over	which,	directly,	we	have	little	or	no control,	as	if	Providence	had	set	them	as	signs	to	direct	us	to	wider fields	of	inquiry	and	exertion.	Even	partial	success	is	often	denied, lest	we	should	rest	satisfied	with	it,	and	forget	the	_truer	and	better means_	of	prevention.”	[9]</p>
<p class="calibre1">Medical	and	sanitary	science	have	made	great	progress	in	the	conquest	of	enteric fever,	diphtheria,	scarlet	fever,	measles,	and	whooping	cough.	The	mortality from	bronchitis	and	from	pulmonary	tuberculosis	has	also	been	reduced,	but nevertheless	tuberculosis	still	claims	more	victims	in	the	prime	of	life	than	any other	malady.	It	is	a	disease	of	civilisation	and	is	intimately	associated	with economic	conditions.	The	history	of	tuberculosis	has	yet	to	be	written.	On	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>other	hand,	deaths	from	certain	other	diseases	are	actually	increasing,	as	witness the	following	figures	from	the	Reports	of	the	Registrar-General	for	England	and Wales:</p>

<p class="calibre1">In	view	of	these	figures	it	is	folly	to	suppose	that	the	final	conquest	of	disease	is imminent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(b)	War</p>
<p class="calibre1">War,	foreign	or	civil,	is	another	sword	hanging	over	civilisations,	whereby	the fruits	of	a	long	period	of	growth	may	be	destroyed	in	a	few	years.	After	the Thirty	Years	War	the	recovery	of	Germany	occupied	a	century	and	a	half.	During the	fourteen	years	of	the	Taiping	rebellion	in	China	whole	provinces	were devastated	and	millions	upon	millions	of	people	were	killed	or	died.	In	spite	of the	Great	War	during	the	past	decade,	there	are	some	who	would	delude themselves	and	others	into	the	vain	belief	that,	without	a	radical	change	in international	relations	and	a	determined	effort	to	neutralise	its	causes,	there	will</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>be	no	more	war;	but	unless	the	nations	learn	through	Christianity	that	justice	is higher	than	self-interest	the	following	brilliant	passage	by	Devas	is	as	true	to-day as	when	it	was	written	in	1901:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“True	that	the	spread	of	humanitarianism	and	cosmopolitanism	made	many people	think,	towards	the	end	of	the	nineteenth	century,	that	bloodshed was	at	an	end.	But	their	hopes	were	dreams:	the	visible	growth	of national	rivalry	and	gigantic	armaments	can	only	issue	in	desperate struggles;	while	not	a	few	among	the	nations	are	troubled	with	the growth	of	internal	dissensions	and	accumulations	of	social	hatred	that point	to	bloody	catastrophes	in	the	future;	and	the	tremendous	means	of destruction	that	modern	science	puts	in	our	hands	offer	frightful possibilities	of	slaughter,	murderous	anarchical	outrages,	and	rivers of	blood	shed	in	pitiless	repression.”	[10]</p>
<p class="calibre1">Malthusians	may	inveigh	against	wars	waged	to	achieve	the	expansion	of	a nation,	but	so	long	as	international	rivalry	disregards	the	moral	law	their	words will	neither	stop	war	nor	prevent	a	Malthusian	country	from	falling	an	easy	prey to	a	stronger	people.	On	the	contrary,	a	low	birthrate,	by	reducing	the	potential force	available	for	defence,	is	actually	an	incentive	to	a	declaration	of	war	from an	envious	neighbour,	because	it	means	that	he	will	not	hesitate	so	long	when attempting	to	count	the	cost	beforehand.	In	1850	the	population	of	France	and Germany	numbered	practically	the	same,	35,500,000;	in	1913	that	of	France	was 39,600,000,	that	of	Germany	67,000,000.	[11]	The	bearing	of	these	facts	on	the Great	War	is	obvious.	In	1919	the	new	Germany,	including	Silesia,	had	a population	of	just	over	60,000,000;	whereas,	in	1921,	France,	including	Alsace-Lorraine,	had	a	population	of	39,200,000.	Thus,	despite	her	victory	in	the	war, the	population	of	France	is	less	to-day	than	it	was	seven	years	ago. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Section	10.	MORAL	CATASTROPHES</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	view	of	past	history	only	an	ostrich	with	its	head	in	the	sand	can	profess	to believe	that	there	will	be	no	calamities	in	the	future	to	reduce	the	population	of the	earth.	And	apart	from	cataclysms	of	disease	or	of	war,	empires	have	perished by	moral	catastrophe.	A	disbelief	in	God	results	in	selfishness,	and	in	various moral	catastrophes.	In	the	terse	phrase	of	Mr.	Bernard	Shaw,	“Voluptuaries prosper	and	perish.”	[12]	For	example,	during	the	second	century	B.C.	the disease	of	rationalism,	[13]	spread	over	Greece,	and	a	rapid	depopulation	of	the country	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	facts	were	recorded	by	Polybius,	[14]	who	expressly	states	that	at	the	time of	which	he	is	writing	serious	pestilences	did	not	occur,	and	that	depopulation was	caused	by	the	selfishness	of	the	Greeks,	who,	being	addicted	to	pleasure, either	did	not	marry	at	all	or	refused	to	rear	more	than	one	or	two	children,	lest	it should	be	impossible	to	bring	them	up	in	extravagant	luxury.	This	ancient historian	also	noted	that	the	death	of	a	son	in	war	or	by	pestilence	is	a	serious matter	when	there	are	only	one	or	two	sons	in	a	family.	Greece	fell	to	the conquering	Romans,	and	they	also	in	course	of	time	were	infected	with	this	evil canker.	There	came	a	day	when	over	the	battlements	of	Constantinople	the blood-red	Crescent	was	unfurled.	Later	on	all	Christendom	was	threatened,	and the	King	of	France	appealed	to	the	Pope	for	men	and	arms	to	resist	the	challenge to	Europe	of	the	Mohammedan	world.	The	Empire	of	the	Turk	spread	over	the whole	of	South-Eastern	Europe.	But	once	more	the	evil	poison	spread,	this	time into	the	homes	in	many	parts	of	Islam,	and	to-day	the	once	triumphant	foes	of Christianity	are	decaying	nations	whose	dominions	are	the	appanage	of	Europe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	face	of	these	facts	it	is	sheer	madness	to	assume	that	all	the	Great	Powers	now existing	will	maintain	their	population	and	prove	immune	from	decay.	Indeed, the	very	propaganda	against	which	this	Essay	is	directed	is	in	itself	positive proof	that	the	seeds	of	decay	have	already	been	sown	within	the	British	Empire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet,	in	an	age	in	which	thought	and	reason	are	suppressed	by	systematised confusion	and	spiritless	perplexity,	the	very	simplicity	of	a	truth	will	operate against	its	general	acceptance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	the	theological	point	of	view,	the	myth	of	overpopulation	is	definitely	of anti-Christian	growth,	because	it	assumes	that,	owing	to	the	operation	of	natural instincts	implanted	in	mankind	by	the	Creator,	the	only	alternative	offered	to	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">THE	FALSE	DEDUCTIONS	CONCERNING	POVERTY</p>
<p class="calibre1">From	the	original	root-fallacy	Malthus	argued	that	poverty,	prostitution,	war, disease,	and	a	high	death-rate	are	necessary	in	order	to	keep	down	the population:	and	from	the	same	false	premises	birth	controllers	are	now	arguing that	a	high	birthrate	causes	(1)	poverty,	and	(2)	a	high	death-rate.	The	steps	in	the argument	whereby	these	amazing	conclusions	are	reached	are	as	follows.	Before the	death-rate	can	be	lowered	the	social	conditions	of	the	people	must	be improved;	if	social	conditions	are	improved	there	will	be	an	enormous	increase of	population	in	geometrical	progression;	the	food	supply	of	the	country	and even	of	the	world	cannot	be	increased	at	the	same	rate;	and	therefore	there	will be	greater	poverty	and	a	higher	death-rate	unless	the	birthrate	is	lowered.	Thus Malthusians	argue.	In	view	of	the	false	premises	on	which	their	argument	is based,	it	is	not	surprising	to	find	that	their	deductions	are	erroneous	and	contain many	economic	and	statistical	fallacies,	to	the	consideration	of	which	we	may now	devote	our	attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	1.	BIRTHRATE	AND	POVERTY</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	first	false	deduction	of	birth	controllers	is	that	a	high	birthrate,	by intensifying	the	struggle	for	existence,	increases	poverty.	In	order	to	bolster	up this	contention,	Malthusians	quote	three	arguments	concerning	(a)	famines,	(b) abundance,	and	(c)	wages,	and	each	of	these	arguments	is	fallacious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(a)	 <i class="calibre4">Famines</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	prevalence	of	famines	is	quoted	as	a	proof	of	reckless	overpopulation.	Now a	famine	may	occur	from	several	different	causes,	some	within	and	others beyond	the	control	of	man,	but	a	failure	of	crops	has	never	yet	been	caused	by pressure	on	the	soil.	On	the	contrary,	famine	is	less	likely	to	arise	in	a	country whose	soil	is	intensively	cultivated,	because	intensive	cultivation	means	a variety	of	crops,	and	therefore	less	risk	of	all	the	crops	failing.	Moreover,	during the	past	century	famine	has	occurred	in	Bengal,	where	population	is	dense;	in Ireland,	where	population	is	moderate,	and	in	Eastern	Russia,	where	population</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>is	scanty.	The	existence	of	famine	is	therefore	no	proof	that	a	country	is overpopulated,	although	it	may	indicate	that	a	country	is	badly	governed	or under-developed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">(b)	 <i class="calibre4">Abundance</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Malthusians	also	claim	that	by	means	of	artificial	birth	control	we	could	live	in	a land	of	abundance.	They	point	out	that,	as	the	population	of	a	new	colony increases,	the	colonists,	by	applying	the	methods	of	civilisation	to	the	rich	soil, become	more	and	more	prosperous.	Eventually	there	comes	a	time	when	capital or	labour	applied	to	the	soil	gives	a	 <i class="calibre4">maximum</i>	return	 <i class="calibre4">per	head</i>	of	population. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	that	point	has	been	reached	any	further	capital	or	labour	applied	to	the	soil will	produce	a	smaller	return	per	head	of	population.	This	“law	of	diminishing returns”	may	be	illustrated	by	a	simpler	example.	Let	us	suppose	that	during	one year	a	market	garden	worked	by	one	man	has	produced	vegetables	to	the	value of	�10.	During	the	second	year	the	garden	is	worked	by	ten	men	and	produces vegetables	to	the	value	of	�200.	It	is	obvious	that	the	work	of	ten	men	has produced	twice	as	much	per	head	as	the	work	of	one	man,	because	each	man	has produced	not	�10	but	�20.	During	the	third	year	the	garden	is	worked	by twenty	men	and	yields	vegetables	to	the	value	of	�300.	The	total	yield	is greater,	but	the	yield	per	head	is	less,	because	each	man	has	produced	not	�20</p>
<p class="calibre1">but	�15.	The	point	of	maximum	production	per	head	has	been	passed,	and	the law	of	diminishing	returns	is	operating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	restricting	the	birthrate	Malthusians	would	limit	the	population	to	the	number necessary	for	maximum	production	per	head.	Now,	in	the	first	place,	it	would	be very	difficult,	if	not	impossible,	in	the	case	of	a	country	with	various	industries, to	decide	when	the	line	of	maximum	production	had	been	passed	at	any	given time.	Moreover,	it	would	be	utterly	impossible	to	fix	this	line	permanently.	In	the case	of	our	market	garden	the	introduction	of	intensive	horticulture	might	mean that	maximum	production	per	head	required	the	work	of	forty	men.	Again,	the very	phrase	“maximum	production	per	head”	implies	sterling	moral	qualities	in the	workers,	and	an	absence	of	drones;	and	sterling	moral	qualities	have	never been	prominent	in	any	nation,	once	the	practice	of	artificial	birth	control	has been	adopted.	Lastly,	the	Christian	ideal	requires	for	its	realisation,	not	a maximum,	but	an	adequate	supply	of	food,	clothing,	shelter,	and	fuel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Christianity	teaches	that	to	seek	after	the	maximum	enjoyment	of	material	things</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>is	not	the	chief	end	of	man,	because	the	life	of	a	man	in	this	world	is	very	short compared	with	his	life	in	eternity. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">(c)	 <i class="calibre4">Wages</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Wages	Fund	Theory	is	an	economic	reflection	of	the	Malthusian	myth.	This theory	assumes	that	a	definite	fixed	sum	is	available	every	year	for	distribution as	wages	amongst	labourers,	so	that	the	more	numerous	the	labourers	the	less wages	will	each	one	receive.	From	this	theory	Malthusians	argue	that	the	only remedy	for	low	wages	is	artificial	birth	control.	They	carefully	refrain	from telling	the	working	classes	the	other	aspect	of	this	Wages	Fund	theory—namely, that	if	the	workers	in	one	trade	receive	a	rise	in	wages,	a	corresponding reduction	must	be	made	in	the	wages	of	others,	so	that	a	rise	in	wages	here	and there	confers	no	real	benefit	on	the	labouring	classes	as	a	whole.	That	is	merely one	illustration	of	capitalist	bias	in	the	Malthusian	propaganda.	In	any	case, economic	science	has	discarded	the	Wages	Fund	Theory	as	a	pure	fiction.	No fixed	or	definite	sum	is	available	for	wages,	because	the	wages	of	a	labourer	are derived	from	the	produce	of	his	work.	Even	in	the	case	of	making	a	railway, where	wages	are	paid	before	the	work	is	completed,	the	money	is	advanced	by shareholders	on	the	security	of	the	proceeds	that	will	eventually	accrue	from	the produce	of	the	labourers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	2.	POVERTY	IN	GREAT	BRITAIN	DUE	TO	OTHER	CAUSES</p>
<p class="calibre1">(a)	 <i class="calibre4">Under-development</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	if	the	theory	of	birth	controllers,	that	a	high	birthrate	increases	poverty, were	as	true	as	it	is	false,	it	could	not	possibly	apply	to	Great	Britain	or	to	any other	country	open	to	commercial	intercourse	with	the	world;	because	there	is	no evidence	that	the	supply	of	food	in	the	world	either	cannot	or	will	not	be increased	to	meet	any	actual	or	possible	demand.	Within	the	British	Empire alone	there	was	an	increase	of	75	per	cent.	in	the	production	of	wheat	between 1901	and	1911.	[15]	In	Great	Britain	there	has	been	not	only	an	increase	of population	but	also	an	increased	consumption	of	various	foods	per	head	of	the population.	Moreover,	if	Britain	were	as	well	cultivated	as	is	Flanders	we	could produce	all	or	nearly	all	our	own	food.	[16]</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>The	truth	is	that	in	countries	such	as	England,	Belgium,	and	Bengal,	usually cited	by	Malthusians,	as	illustrating	the	misery	that	results	from	overpopulation, there	is	no	evidence	whatsoever	to	prove	that	the	population	is	pressing	on	the soil.	On	the	contrary,	we	find	ample	physical	resources	sufficient	to	support	the entire	population,	and	we	also	find	evidence	of	human	injustice,	incapacity,	and corruption	sufficient	to	account	for	the	poverty	and	misery	that	exist	in	these countries.	This	was	especially	so	in	Ireland	during	the	first	half	of	the	nineteenth century.	[17]	Moreover,	so	far	from	high	birthrates	being	the	cause	of	poverty, we	shall	find	that	poverty	is	one	of	the	causes	of	a	high	birthrate	(p.	69). </p>
<p class="calibre1">(b)	 <i class="calibre4">Severance	of	the	Inhabitants	from	the	Soil</i> It	was	not	a	high	birthrate	that	established	organised	poverty	in	England.	In	the sixteenth	century	the	greater	part	of	the	land,	including	common	land	belonging to	the	poor,	was	seized	by	the	rich.	They	began	by	robbing	the	Catholic	Church, and	they	ended	by	robbing	the	people.	[18]	Once	machinery	was	introduced	in the	eighteenth	century,	the	total	wealth	of	England	was	enormously	increased; but	the	vast	majority	of	the	people	had	little	share	in	this	increase	of	wealth	that accrued	from	machinery,	because	only	a	small	portion	of	the	people	possessed capital.	More	children	came,	but	they	came	to	conditions	of	poverty	and	of child-labour	in	the	mills.	In	countries	where	more	natural	and	stable	social conditions	exist,	and	where	there	are	many	small	owners	of	land,	large	families, so	far	from	being	a	cause	of	poverty,	are	of	the	greatest	assistance	to	their parents	and	to	themselves.	There	are	means	whereby	poverty	could	be	reduced, but	artificial	birth	control	would	only	increase	the	total	poverty	of	the	State,	and therefore	of	the	individual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	early	down	to	Tudor	times,	the	majority	of	the	inhabitants	of	England	lived on	small	holdings.	For	example,	in	the	fifteenth	century	there	were	twenty-one small	holdings	on	a	particular	area	measuring	160	acres.	During	the	sixteenth century	the	number	of	holdings	on	this	area	had	fallen	to	six,	and	in	the seventeenth	century	the	160	acres	became	 <i class="calibre4">one</i>	farm.	Occasionally	an	effort	was made	to	check	this	process,	and	by	a	statute	of	Elizabeth	penalties	were	enacted against	building	any	cottages	“without	laying	four	acres	of	land	thereto.”	On	the other	hand,	acres	upon	acres	were	given	to	the	larger	landowners	by	a	series	of Acts	for	the	enclosure	of	common	land,	whereby	many	labourers	were	deprived of	their	land.	From	the	reign	of	George	I	to	that	of	George	III	 <i class="calibre4">nearly	four</i> <i class="calibre4">thousand	enclosure	bills</i>	were	passed.	These	wrongs	have	not	been	righted. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">“To	urge,”	wrote	Professor	Bain,	“that	there	is	sufficient	poverty	and toil	in	the	world	without	bringing	in	more	to	share	it	than	can	be provided	for,	implies	either	begging	the	question	at	issue—a	direct imputation	that	the	world	is	at	present	very	badly	managed—or	that	all persons	should	take	it	upon	themselves	to	say	how	much	poverty	and	toil will	exist	in	any	part	of	the	world	in	the	future,	or	limit	the productiveness	of	any	race,	because	inadequate	means	of	feeding, clothing,	or	employing	them	may	be	adopted	in	that	part	of	time sometimes	called	unborn	eternity.	As	a	rule,	the	result	usually	has been:	limit	the	increase	of	population	without	adequate	cause,	and	the reaction	causes	deterioration	or	annihilation.”	[19]</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lastly,	there	is	evidence	that	poverty	has	existed	in	thinly	populated	countries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard	Cobden,	writing	in	1836,	of	Russia,	states:	“The	mass	of	the	people	are sunk	in	poverty,	ignorance,	and	barbarism,	scarcely	rising	above	a	state	of nature,	and	yet	it	has	been	estimated	that	this	country	contains	more	than 750,000	square	miles	of	land,	of	a	quality	not	inferior	to	the	best	portions	of Germany,	and	upon	which	a	population	of	200,000,000	might	find	subsistence.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>As	will	be	shown	in	Chapter	V,	poverty	is	generally	the	cause	and	not	the	result of	a	high	birthrate.	The	Malthusian	doctrine	has	been	and	is	to-day	a	barrier	to social	reform,	because	it	implies	that	humane	legislation,	by	encouraging population,	will	of	necessity	defeat	the	aim	of	those	who	desire	to	improve	the conditions	of	the	poor	by	methods	other	than	the	practice	of	artificial	birth control.	To	a	very	great	extent	Malthusian	teaching	was	responsible	for	the	Poor Law	of	1834,	the	most	severe	in	Europe,	the	demoralising	laxity	of	the	old	Poor Law	being	replaced	by	degrading	severity.	Again,	as	recently	as	1899,	a Secretary	of	State	reiterated	the	Malthusian	doctrine	by	explaining	that	great poverty	throughout	India	was	due	to	the	increase	of	population	under	the	 <i class="calibre4">pax</i> <i class="calibre4">Britannica</i>.	Now	the	truth	is	that	if	the	social	conditions	of	the	poor	were improved,	we	have	every	reason	to	believe	that	their	birthrate	would	be	reduced, because	as	civilisation	in	a	community	progresses	there	is	a	natural	decline	in fertility.

<p class="calibre1">From	this	false	law	he	argued	that,	as	population	increases	too	rapidly,	the newcomers	cannot	hope	to	find	a	sufficiency	of	good	things;	that	the	poverty	of the	masses	is	not	due	to	conditions	created	by	man,	but	to	a	natural	law;	and	that consequently	this	law	cannot	be	altered	by	any	change	in	political	institutions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	new	doctrine	was	eagerly	adopted	by	the	rich,	who	were	thus	enabled	to argue	that	Nature	intended	that	the	masses	should	find	no	room	at	her	feast;	and that	therefore	our	system	of	industrial	capitalism	was	in	harmony	with	the	Will of	God.	Most	comforting	dogma!	Most	excellent	anodyne	for	conscience	against acceptance	of	those	rights	of	man	that,	being	ignored,	found	terrible	expression in	the	French	Revolution!	Without	discussion,	without	investigation,	and	without proof,	our	professors,	politicians,	leader-writers,	and	even	our	well-meaning socialists,	have	accepted	as	true	the	bare	falsehood	that	there	is	always	an insufficient	supply	of	the	necessities	of	life;	and	to-day	this	heresy	permeates	all our	practical	politics.	In	giving	this	forged	law	of	nature	to	the	rich,	Malthus robbed	the	poor	of	hope.	Such	was	his	crime	against	humanity.	In	the	words	of Thorold	Rogers,	Malthusianism	was	part	and	parcel	of	“a	conspiracy,	conceived by	the	law	and	carried	out	by	parties	interested	in	its	success,	to	cheat	the English	workman	of	his	wages,	to	tie	him	to	the	soil,	to	deprive	him	of	hope,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>to	degrade	him	into	immediate	poverty.”	When	Malthusians	enter	a	slum	for	the purpose	of	preaching	birth	control,	it	is	right	that	the	people	should	be	told	what is	written	on	the	passports	of	these	strangers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(b)	 <i class="calibre4">A	Hindrance	to	Reform</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	teaching	of	birth	control	amongst	the	poor	is	in	itself	a	crime,	because,	apart from	the	evil	practice,	the	people	are	asked	to	believe	a	lie,	namely,	that	a	high birthrate	is	the	cause	of	poverty	and	that	by	means	of	birth-control	their circumstances	will	be	improved.	By	one	advocate	of	birth	control	this	weak reasoning	and	inconsequential	sentimentality	have	actually	been	crowded	into the	compass	of	a	single	sentence:	“We	must	no	longer	be	content	to	remain indifferent	and	idle	witnesses	of	the	senseless	and	unthinking	procreating	of countless	wretched	children,	whose	parents	are	diseased	and	vicious.”	[22]	It	is true	that	disease,	vice,	and	wretched	children	are	the	saddest	products	of	our industrial	system;	it	is	also	true	that	a	helpless	baby	never	yet	was	guilty	of expropriating	land,	of	building	slums,	of	under-paying	the	workers,	or	of	rigging the	market.	Therefore	instead	of	preventing	the	birth	of	children	we	should	set about	to	rectify	the	evil	conditions	which	make	the	lives	of	children	and	adults unhappy.	Like	many	other	policies	advocated	on	behalf	of	the	poor,	birth	control is	immoral	if	only	on	this	account,	that	it	distracts	attention	from	the	real	causes of	poverty.	In	Spain	birth	control	is	not	practised.	I	do	not	say	there	is	no	poverty in	that	country,	but	there	is	no	poverty	that	resembles	the	hopeless	grinding poverty	of	the	English	poor.	For	that	strange	disease,	artificial	birth	control	is	a worthless	remedy;	and	it	were	far	better	that	we	should	turn	our	attention	to	the simple	words	of	Cardinal	Manning:	“There	is	a	natural	and	divine	law,	anterior and	superior	to	all	human	and	civil	law,	by	which	men	have	the	right	to	live	of the	fruits	of	the	soil	on	which	they	are	born,	and	in	which	they	are	buried.”	[23]</p>
<p class="calibre1">(c)	 <i class="calibre4">A	Quack	Remedy	for	Poverty</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Artificial	birth	control	is	one	of	the	many	quack	remedies	advertised	for	the	cure of	poverty,	and	G.K.	Chesterton	has	given	the	final	answer	to	the	Malthusian assertion	that	some	form	of	birth	control	is	essential	 <i class="calibre4">because	houses	are	scarce</i>:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Consider	that	simple	sentence,	and	you	will	see	what	is	the	matter with	the	modern	mind.	I	do	not	mean	the	growth	of	immorality;	I	mean</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>the	genesis	of	gibbering	idiocy.	There	are	ten	little	boys	whom	you wish	to	provide	with	ten	top-hats;	and	you	find	there	are	only	eight top-hats.	To	a	simple	mind	it	would	seem	not	impossible	to	make	two more	hats;	to	find	out	whose	business	it	is	to	make	hats,	and	induce him	to	make	hats;	to	agitate	against	an	absurd	delay	in	delivering hats;	to	punish	anybody	who	has	promised	hats	and	failed	to	provide hats.	The	modern	mind	is	that	which	says	that	if	we	only	cut	off	the heads	of	two	of	the	little	boys,	they	will	not	want	hats;	and	then	the hats	will	exactly	go	round.	The	suggestion	that	heads	are	rather	more important	than	hats	is	dismissed	as	a	piece	of	mystical	metaphysics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	assertion	that	hats	were	made	for	heads,	and	not	heads	for	hats savours	of	antiquated	dogma.	The	musty	text	which	says	that	the	body	is more	than	raiment;	the	popular	prejudice	which	would	prefer	the	lives of	boys	to	the	mathematical	arrangement	of	hats,—all	these	things	are alike	to	be	ignored.	The	logic	of	enlightenment	is	merciless;	and	we duly	summon	the	headsman	to	disguise	the	deficiencies	of	the	hatter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	it	makes	very	little	difference	to	the	logic	of	the	thing,	that	we are	talking	of	houses	and	not	of	hats….	The	fundamental	fallacy remains	the	same;	that	we	are	beginning	at	the	wrong	end,	because	we have	never	troubled	to	consider	at	what	end	to	begin.”	[24]</p>

<p class="calibre1">A	modern	writer	is	burdened	by	many	words	that	carry	an	erroneous	meaning, and	one	of	these	is	the	word	“civilisation.”	Intended	to	mean	“The	Art	of Living,”	this	word,	by	wrong	usage,	now	implies	that	our	method	of	combining mental	culture	and	bodily	comfort	is	the	highest,	noblest,	and	best	way	to	live. </p>

<p class="calibre1">HIGH	BIRTHRATES	NOT	THE	CAUSE	OF	HIGH	DEATH-RATES</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	1.	POVERTY	AS	NOW	EXISTING</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	second	contention	of	birth	controllers	is	that	a	high	birthrate,	by	increasing poverty,	causes	a	high	death-rate.	In	the	first	place,	there	is	no	doubt	that poverty,	necessary	features	of	which	are	mal-nutrition	or	insufficient	food	and bad	housing,	is	directly	associated	with	a	high	death-rate,	although	this	view	was once	shown	by	the	 <i class="calibre4">Lancet</i>	to	need	important	qualifications. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“With	respect	to	the	greater	mortality	amongst	the	poor	than	the	rich, we	have	yet	to	learn	that	the	only	hope	of	lessening	the	death-rate lies	in	diminishing	the	birthrate.	We	have	no	 <i class="calibre4">proof</i>	as	yet	that	the majority	of	the	evils	at	present	surrounding	the	poor	are	necessarily attendant	upon	poverty.	We	have	yet	to	see	a	poor	population	living	in dry,	well-drained,	well-ventilated	houses,	properly	supplied	with	pure water	and	the	means	of	disposal	of	refuse.	And	we	have	yet	to	become acquainted	with	a	poor	population	spending	their	scant	earnings entirely,	or	in	a	very	large	proportion,	upon	the	necessities	of	life; for	such	is	not	the	case	when	half	the	earnings	of	a	family	are	thrown away	to	provide	adulterated	alcoholic	drinks	for	one	member	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Until	reforms	such	as	these	and	others	have	been	carried	out,	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>poor	are	able	and	willing	to	conform	to	known	physiological	laws,	it	is premature	to	speak	of	taking	measures	to	lessen	the	birthrate—a proposal,	be	it	said,	which	makes	the	humiliating	confession	of	man’s defeat	in	the	battle	of	life.”	[25]</p>
<p class="calibre1">It	will	be	seen	that	the	qualifications	practically	remove	the	question	from dispute.	[26]	If	the	conditions	of	the	poor	were	thus	altered,	poverty,	as	it	exists to-day,	would	of	course	disappear.	As	things	are,	we	find	that	a	high	death-rate	is related	to	poverty,	as	is	proved,	for	example,	by	the	death-rate	from	tuberculosis being	four	times	greater	in	slums	than	in	the	best	residential	quarters	of	a	city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	correct	answer	to	the	birth	controllers	is	that	a	high	birthrate	is	not	the	cause of	a	high	death-rate,	because	high	birthrates,	as	shown	in	the	previous	chapter, are	not	the	cause	of	poverty,	but	vice	versa.	Moreover,	all	the	statistical	evidence goes	to	prove	that	in	this	matter	we	are	right	and	that	Malthusians	are	wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	2.	HIGH	BIRTHRATE	NOT	THE	CAUSE	OF	HIGH	DEATH-RATE: PROVED	FROM	STATISTICS</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	China,	where	there	is	said	to	be	a	birthrate	of	over	50	per	1,000,	and	where over	70	per	cent.	of	infants	are	helped	to	die,	the	high	death-rate	is	due	clearly	to degraded	social	customs.	In	the	slums	of	Great	Britain	the	high	death-rate	is	also due	to	degraded	social	conditions.	It	is	not	due	to	the	birthrate.	Of	this	the	proof is	simple,	(a)	Among	the	French	Canadians,	where	the	average	family	numbers about	nine,	this	high	birthrate	is	not	associated	with	a	high	death-rate,	but	with the	increase	of	a	thrifty,	hard-working	race.	In	Ontario	the	birthrate	went	up	from 21.10	in	1910	to	24.7	in	1911,	and	the	death-rate	 <i class="calibre4">fell</i>	from	14	to	12.6.	(b)	Again, in	1911	the	corrected	birthrate	for	Connaught	was	45.3	as	against	a	crude	rate	of 24.7	for	England	and	Wales;	and	in	Connaught,	where	there	is	no	need	for Societies	for	preventing	Parents	being	Cruel	to	their	Children,	the	infant mortality	rate	[27]	is	very	much	lower	than	in	England,	although	the	birthrate	is much	higher	and	the	poverty	much	greater.	In	Bradford,	a	prosperous	English town	which	pays	particular	attention	to	its	mothers	and	children,	the	infant mortality	in	1917	was	132	per	1,000	and	the	birthrate	13.2.	In	Connaught,	where there	are	no	maternity	centres	or	other	aids	to	survival,	but	on	the	contrary	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>great	dearth	of	the	means	of	well-being,	the	infant	mortality	was	only	50,	whilst the	birthrate	was	actually	45!	[28]	So	untrue	is	it	to	say	that	a	high	death-rate	is due	to	a	high	birthrate. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	3.	A	LOW	BIRTHRATE	NO	GUARANTEE	OF	A	LOW	DEATH-RATE</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again,	birth	controllers	claim	that	a	low	birthrate	leads	to	a	low	infant	mortality rate.	Now,	it	is	really	a	very	extraordinary	thing	that,	whatever	be	the	statement made	by	a	Malthusian	on	the	subject	of	birth-control,	the	very	opposite	is	found to	be	the	truth.	During	the	last	quarter	of	last	century	a	 <i class="calibre4">falling</i>	birthrate	in England	was	actually	accompanied	by	a	 <i class="calibre4">rising</i>	infant	mortality	rate!	During 1918	in	Ireland	[29]	the	crude	birthrate	was	19.9,	with	an	infant	mortality	rate	of 86,	whereas	in	England	and	Wales	[30]	the	crude	birthrate	was	17.7	with	an infant	mortality	rate	of	97,	and	in	the	northern	boroughs	the	appalling	rate	of 120.	In	England	and	Wales	the	lowest	infant	mortality	rate	was	found	to	be	in	the southern	rural	districts,	where	the	rate	was	63,	but	in	Connaught	the	rate	was 50.5.	This	means	that	in	England	a	low	birthrate	is	associated	with	a	high	infant mortality	rate,	whereas	in	Ireland	a	high	birthrate	is	associated	with	a	low	infant mortality	rate.	[31]	These	cold	figures	prove	that	in	this	matter	at	least	the poorest	Irish	peasants	are	richer	than	the	people	of	England. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	4.	VITAL	STATISTICS	OF	FRANCE</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Malthusian	claim	that	a	low	birthrate	leads	to	a	low	death-rate	is	also disproved	by	the	vital	statistics	of	France. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“The	death-rate	of	France	has	not	declined	at	the	same	rate	as	the birthrate	has,	and,	while	the	incidence	of	mortality	in	France	was equal	to	that	of	England	in	the	middle	of	the	seventies,	the	English mortality	is	now	only	five-sevenths	of	the	French.	England	thus</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>maintains	a	fair	natural	increase,	although	the	birthrate	has	declined at	an	even	faster	pace	than	has	been	the	case	in	France…. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“The	French	death-rate	is	higher	than	is	the	case	with	most	of	her neighbours,	and	it	can	quite	well	be	reduced.	The	reasons	for	her fairly	high	mortality	are	not	to	be	found	in	climatic	conditions, racial	characteristics,	or	other	unchangeable	elements	of	nature,	nor even	in	her	occupations,	since	some	of	the	most	industrial	regions	have a	low	mortality.”	[32]</p>

<p class="calibre1">The	following	table,	covering	two	periods	of	five	years	in	twenty	Departments, proves	that	 <i class="calibre4">the	death-rate	was	lower</i>	in	the	ten	Departments	having	the	highest birthrate	in	France	than	in	the	ten	Departments	having	the	lowest	birthrate. </p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	5.	COEFFICIENTS	OF	CORRELATION</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>As	birth	controllers	rely	very	much	upon	statistics,	and	as	figures	may	very easily	mislead	the	unwary,	it	is	necessary	to	point	out	that	the	Malthusian contention	that	a	high	birthrate	is	the	cause	of	a	high	death-rate	is	not	only contrary	to	reason	and	to	facts,	but	is	also	contrary	to	the	very	figures	which	they quote.	A	high	birthrate	is	often	associated	with	a	high	death-rate,	but	a	general	or uniform	correspondence	between	birthrates	and	death-rates	has	never	been established	by	modern	statistical	methods.	To	these	methods	brief	reference	may be	made.	A	coefficient	of	correlation	is	a	number	intended	to	indicate	the	degree of	similarity	between	two	things,	or	the	extent	to	which	one	moves	with	the other.	If	this	coefficient	is	unity,	or	1,	it	indicates	that	the	two	things	are	similar in	all	respects,	while	if	it	be	zero,	or	0,	it	indicates	that	there	is	no	resemblance between	them.	The	study	of	correlation	is	a	first	step	to	the	study	of	causation, because,	until	we	know	to	what	extent	two	things	move	together,	it	is	useless	to consider	whether	one	causes	the	movement	of	the	other;	but	in	itself	a	coefficient of	correlation	does	not	necessarily	indicate	cause	or	result.	Now	in	this	country, between	1838	and	1912	the	birthrate	and	the	death-rate	show	a	correlation	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">.84;	but	if	that	period	be	split	into	two,	the	correlation	from	1838	to	1876,	when the	birthrate	was	fluctuating,	is	 <i class="calibre4">minus</i>	.12,	and	in	the	period	after	1876	the correlation	is	 <i class="calibre4">plus</i>	.92.	This	means	that	the	whole	of	the	positive	correlation	is due	to	the	falling	of	the	death-rate,	and	that	birthrates	and	death-rates	do	not	of necessity	move	together.	[33]</p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	careful	examination	of	the	vital	statistics	for	France,	Knud	Stouman concludes	as	follows:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“In	France	no	clear	correlation	exists	between	the	birthrate	and	the death-rate	in	the	various	Departments.	The	coefficient	of	correlation between	the	birthrate	and	the	general	death-rate	by	Departments (1909-1913)	was	0.0692�0.1067,	and	including	Alsace	and Lorraine—0.0212�0.1054,	indicating	no	correlation	whatsoever.	A somewhat	different	and	more	interesting	table	is	obtained	when	the correlation	is	made	with	the	mortality	at	each	age	class:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">TABLE	II</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Under	1	year	0.3647	�	0.0986</p>
<p class="calibre1">1-19	years	0.4884	�	0.0816</p>
<p class="calibre1">20-39	years	0.6228	�	0.0656</p>
<p class="calibre1">40-59	years	0.5028	�	0.0801</p>
<p class="calibre1">60	years	and	over	0.2577	�	0.1001</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“A	peculiar	configuration	is	observed	in	these	coefficients	in	that	a quite	pronounced	positive	correlation	exists	at	the	central	age group,	but	disappears	with	some	regularity	towards	both	extremities of	life.	If	the	mortality	has	any	influence	upon	the	natality	this cannot	be	in	the	form	of	replacement	of	lost	infants	and	deceased	old people,	therefore,	as	has	frequently	been	suggested.	That	a	high death-rate	at	the	child-bearing	age	should	be	conducive	to	increased fertility	is	absurd,	neither	does	it	seem	likely	that	a	large	number of	children	should	make	the	parents	more	liable	to	diseases	which	are prevalent	at	this	period	of	life.	The	reasons	must,	then,	be	looked for	in	a	common	factor. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>“Now	the	only	disease	of	importance	representing	the	same	age-curve	as do	the	correlation	coefficients	is	tuberculosis.	This	disease	causes	in France	2	per	cent.	of	the	deaths	under	one	year,	24	per	cent.	of	the deaths	from	1	to	19	years	of	age,	not	less	than	45	per	cent.	from	20	to 39,	18	per	cent.	at	ages	40	to	59,	and	less	than	2	per	cent.	at	the ages	over	60.	Will	a	high	tuberculosis	mortality,	then,	be	conducive	to great	fertility,	or	do	we	have	to	fear	that	a	decrease	of	the	natality will	be	the	result	of	energetic	measures	against	tuberculosis?	Hardly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	death-rate	may	be	reduced,	then,	without	detrimental	effects	upon the	birthrate. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“What	can	the	factor	be	which	influences	both	the	tuberculosis incidence	and	the	birthrate?	We	know	that	the	prevalence	of tuberculosis	is	conditioned	principally	by	poverty	and	ignorance	of hygiene.	The	Parisian	statistics,	as	compiled	by	Dr.	Bertillon	and recently	by	Professor	L.	Hersch,	show	a	much	higher	birthrate	in	the poor	wards	than	in	the	richer	districts,	and	the	high	birthrates	may be	furnished	largely	by	the	poorer	elements	of	the	population.	A comfortable	degree	of	wealth	does	not	imply	a	low	birthrate,	as	is abundantly	shown	elsewhere,	and	one	of	the	important	questions	which suggest	themselves	to	the	French	statistician	and	sociologist	is</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>evidently	the	following:	How	can	the	intellectual	and	economic	standard of	the	masses	be	raised	without	detriment	to	the	natality? </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“We	believe	that	the	time	is	opportune	for	solving	this	question.	The past	half-century	has	been	lived	under	the	shadow	of	defeat	and	with	a sense	of	limitations,	and	of	impotence	against	fate.	This	nightmare	is now	thrown	off,	and,	the	doors	to	the	world	being	open	and	development free,	the	French	people	will	learn	that	new	initiative	has	its	full recompense	and	that	a	living	and	a	useful	activity	can	be	found	for	all the	sons	and	daughters	they	may	get.	The	habit	of	home-staying	is broken	by	the	war,	and	new	and	great	undertakings	are	developing	in	the ruined	north-east	as	well	as	in	the	sunny	south.”	[34]</p>

<p class="calibre1">HOW	RELIGION	AFFECTS	THE	BIRTHRATE</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	1.	FRENCH	STATISTICS	MISINTERPRETED	BY	MALTHUSIANS</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fact	that	Malthusians	are	in	the	habit	of	citing	the	birthrate	in	certain Catholic	countries	as	a	point	in	favour	of	their	propaganda	is	only	another instance	of	their	maladroit	use	of	figures:	because	for	that	argument	there	is	not the	slightest	justification.	The	following	paragraph	from	a	recent	speech	[35]	in the	Anglican	Church	Congress	by	Lord	Dawson,	Physician	to	the	King,	is	a good	example	of	their	methods	in	controversy:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Despite	the	influence	and	condemnations	of	the	Church,	it	(artificial birth	control)	has	been	practised	in	France	for	well	over	half	a century,	and	in	Belgium	and	other	Catholic	countries	is	extending.	And if	the	Roman	Catholic	Church,	with	its	compact	organisation,	its	power of	authority,	and	its	discipline,	cannot	check	this	procedure,	is	it likely	that	Protestant	Churches	will	be	able	to	do	so?	For	Protestant religions	depend	for	their	strength	on	_the	conviction	and	esteem	they establish	in	the	heads	and	hearts	of	their	people_.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	have	italicised	the	closing	words	because	it	would	be	interesting	to	know,	in passing,	whether	anyone	denies	that	these	human	influences	also	contribute	to the	strength	of	the	Catholic	Church.	Among	recent	converts	to	the	Faith	in	this country	are	many	Protestant	clergymen	who	may	be	presumed	to	have	known what	claims	“on	their	conviction	and	esteem”	their	communion	had.	Moreover, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>in	France,	amongst	recent	converts	are	some	of	the	great	intellects	of	that country.	If	it	be	not	“conviction	and	esteem”	in	their	“heads	and	hearts,”	what other	motive,	I	ask,	has	induced	Huysmans,	Barr�s,	and	others	to	make submission	to	Rome? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Secondly,	it	is	true	that	for	over	half	a	century	the	birthrate	of	France	has	been falling,	and	that	to	some	extent	this	decline	is	due	to	the	use	of	contraceptives; but	it	is	also	true	that	during	the	past	fifty	years	the	Government	of	France	has made	a	determined	but	unsuccessful	effort	to	overthrow	the	Catholic	Church; and	that	it	is	in	so	far	as	the	Government	has	weakened	Catholic	influence	and impeded	Catholic	teaching	that	the	birthrate	has	fallen.	The	belief	of	a	nation will	not	influence	its	destiny	unless	that	belief	is	reflected	in	the	actions	of	the citizens.	Father	Herbert	Thurston,	S.J.,	[36]	thus	deals	with	the	argument implied:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Catholicism	which	is	merely	Catholicism	in	name,	and	which	amounts	to no	more	in	the	supposed	believer	than	a	vague	purpose	of	sending	for	a priest	when	he	is	dying,	is	not	likely	to	have	any	restraining	effect upon	the	decline	of	the	birthrate.	Further,	it	is	precisely	because	a really	practical	Catholicism	lays	such	restrictions	upon	freedom	in this	and	in	other	matters,	that	members	of	the	educated	and	comfortable classes,	the	men	especially,	are	prone	to	emancipate	themselves	from all	religious	control	with	an	anti-clerical	rancour	hardly	known	in Protestant	lands.	Had	it	not	been	for	these	defections	from	her teaching,	the	Catholic	Church,	in	most	countries	of	mixed	religion, would	soon	become	predominant	by	the	mere	force	of	natural	fertility. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	as	it	is,	we	believe	that	a	country	like	France	owes	such	small</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>measure	of	natural	increase	as	she	still	retains	almost	entirely	to	the religious	principle	of	the	faithful	few.	Where	the	Catholic	Church preserves	her	sway	over	the	hearts	of	men	the	maintenance	of	a	vigorous stock	is	assured.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	first	place,	it	is	noteworthy	that	the	birthrate	varies	with	practical Catholicism	in	France,	being	much	higher	in	those	Departments	where	the Church	is	more	flourishing.	As	was	shown	by	Professor	Meyrick	Booth	in	1914, there	are	certain	districts	of	France	where	the	birthrate	is	 <i class="calibre4">higher</i>	than	in	the	usual English	country	districts.	For	example,	the	birthrate	in	Finist�re	was	27.1,	in Pas-de-Calais	26.6,	and	in	Morbihan	25.8.	On	the	other	hand,	in	many Departments	the	birthrate	was	lower	than	the	death-rate.	This	occurred,	for example,	in	Lot,	Haute	Garonne,	Tarn-et-Garonne,	Lot-et-Garonne,	and	in	Gers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	two	last-named	Departments	the	birthrates	were	13.6	and	13.0</p>
<p class="calibre1">respectively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	following	table	I	have	tabulated	more	recent	figures	concerning	the	vital statistics	in	these	two	groups	of	Departments,	and	rates	for	the	two	periods	of five	years,	1909-1913,	and	1915-1919,	in	each	group	are	compared. </p>

<p class="calibre1">there	is	a	high	birthrate,	and	moreover	that	in	these	Departments	both	the	death-rate	and	the	infant	mortality	rate	is	 <i class="calibre4">lower</i>	than	in	the	five	Departments	with	the lowest	birthrate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor	Meyrick	Booth’s	comments	are	as	follows:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“The	above	five	departments	(in	which	the	decline	of	population	has been	most	marked)	are	adjacent	to	one	another	in	the	fertile	valley	of the	Garonne,	one	of	the	wealthiest	parts	of	France;	and	we	may	well ask:	Why	should	the	birthrate	under	such	favourable	conditions	be	less than	half	that	which	is	noted	for	the	bleak	district	of	Finist�re?	The noted	statistician,	M.	Leroy-Beaulieu,	has	some	interesting</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>observations	to	offer	upon	this	paradoxical	state	of	things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Considering	the	country	in	general,	and	these	districts	in	particular, he	notes	that	the	most	prolific	parts	of	France	are	those	in	which	the people	have	retained	their	allegiance	to	the	traditional	Church	(in	the case	of	the	Pas-de-Calais	we	have	a	certain	degree	of	adherence	to	the orthodox	faith	combined	with	the	presence	of	a	large	mining population).	M.	Leroy-Beaulieu	expresses	the	opinion	that	the	Catholic Church	tends,	by	means	of	its	whole	atmosphere,	to	promote	a	general increase	of	population;	for,	more	than	other	types	of	Christianity,	it condemns	egoism,	materialism,	and	inordinate	ambition	for	self	or family;	and,	moreover,	it	works	in	the	same	direction	through	its uncompromising	condemnation	of	modern	Malthusian	practices.	He	draws our	attention,	further,	to	the	new	wave	of	religious	life	which	has swept	over	the	 <i class="calibre4">haute-bourgeoisie</i>	of	France	during	the	last	few decades;	and	he	does	not	hesitate	to	connect	this	with	the	fact	that this	class	is	now	one	of	the	most	prolific	(perhaps	the	most	prolific) in	the	nation.	Space	forbids	my	taking	up	this	subject	in	detail,	but it	appears	from	a	considerable	body	of	figures	which	have	been collected	that,	while	the	average	number	of	children	born	to	each marriage	in	the	English	Protestant	upper	middle	class	is	not	more	than about	2.0	to	2.5,	the	number	born	to	each	marriage	in	the	corresponding</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>class	in	France	is	between	3.0	and	4.0.	Taking	the	foregoing	facts	into consideration,	it	would	appear	that	Roman	Catholicism—even	in France—is	very	considerably	more	prolific	(where	the	belief	of	the people	is	at	all	deep)	than	English	Protestantism.	This	applies	both	to the	upper	and	lower	classes.”	[37]</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	all	probability	Lord	Dawson	was	unaware	of	the	foregoing,	but	there	is	one fact	which,	as	a	Neo-Malthusian,	he	ought	to	have	known,	because	the	omission of	this	fact	in	his	address	is	a	serious	matter.	When	referring	to	France	as	a country	where	birth	control	had	come	to	stay,  <i class="calibre4">Lord	Dawson	did	not	tell	his</i> <i class="calibre4">audience	that	the	Government	of	France	has	now	suppressed	the	only</i> <i class="calibre4">Malthusian	periodical	in	that	country,	and	has	proposed	a	law,	whereby	those</i> <i class="calibre4">who	engage	in	birth	control	propaganda	shall	be	imprisoned</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	2.	EVIDENCE	FROM	HOLLAND</p>
<p class="calibre1">As	regards	other	countries,	Holland	is	usually	described	as	the	Mecca	of Malthusians,	being	“the	only	country	where	Neo-Malthusianism	has	been	given the	opportunity	of	diminishing	the	excessive	birthrate	on	eugenic	lines,  <i class="calibre4">i.e. </i>	in	the reduction	of	the	fertility	of	the	poorest	classes,”	[38]	and	where	a	“considerable rise	in	the	wages	and	general	prosperity	appears	to	have	taken	place	side	by	side with	an	unprecedented	increase	of	population.”	When	we	come	to	investigate this	claim	we	find	that,	of	the	eleven	provinces	of	Holland,	two	are	almost entirely	Catholic,	these	being	North	Brabant,	with	649,000	inhabitants,	and Limburg,	with	358,000	inhabitants.	On	the	other	hand,	in	Friesland,	with 366,000	inhabitants,	not	more	than	8	per	cent,	are	Catholics.	The	vital	statistics for	1913	are	quoted	by	Father	Thurston,	S.J.:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“…	We	find	that	in	Limburg	the	crude	birthrate	is	33.4,	in	North Brabant	it	is	32.5,	but	in	Friesland	it	is	24.3.	Of	course,	this	is	not</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>the	beginning	and	end	of	the	matter.	In	North	Brabant	the	death-rate	is 16.36,	in	Limburg	it	is	15.28,	in	Friesland	it	is	only	11.21,	but	the fact	remains	that	in	the	two	Catholic	provinces	the	natural	increase	is 16.17	and	18.15,	while	in	the	non-Catholic	province	of	Friesland	it	is 13.15.	Further,	no	one	can	doubt	that	in	such	densely	populated districts	as	North	and	South	Holland	and	Gelderland	the	Catholics,	who number	more	than	25	per	cent,	of	the	inhabitants,	exercise	a perceptible	influence	in	raising	the	birth	figures	for	the	whole kingdom.	The	results	would	be	very	different	if	the	entire	country adopted	Neo-Malthusian	principles.”	[39]</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	3.	THE	UNITED	STATES	OF	AMERICA</p>
<p class="calibre1">As	was	proved	by	the	census	of	religions	in	1906,	the	United	States	of	America is	becoming	a	great	stronghold	of	the	Faith.	In	Massachusetts	the	Catholic Church	numbered	1,100,000	members,	whereas	the	total	membership	of	all	the Protestant	Churches	was	450,000.	In	Illinois	there	were	about	300,000</p>
<p class="calibre1">Methodists	and	1,000,000	Catholics.	There	were	2,300,000	Catholics	in	the	State of	New	York,	and	about	300,000	Methodists,	while	no	other	Protestant	Church numbered	more	than	200,000.	The	New	England	States,	once	the	home	of American	Puritanism,	are	now	great	centres	of	Catholicism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor	Meyrick	Booth	[40]	explains	this	remarkable	change	as	being	due	to two	causes:	(1)	The	influx	of	large	numbers	of	European	Catholics,	who	cling tenaciously	to	their	religion;	(2)	the	greater	fertility	of	these	stocks	as	compared with	the	native	population.

<p class="calibre1">In	these	States	the	birthrate	is	very	much	higher	than	in	the	former.	Furthermore, a	New	York	paper	[40]	investigated	the	birthrate	in	that	city	with	special reference	to	religious	belief,	and	concluded	that	the	different	bodies	could	be graded	as	follows	with	respect	to	the	number	of	children	per	marriage:	(1)	Jews, (2)	Catholics,	(3)	Protestants	(Orthodox),	(4)	Protestants	(Liberal),	and	(5) Agnostic.	Professor	Meyrick	Booth,	who	is	himself	a	Protestant,	concludes	his survey	of	the	evidence	as	follows:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“looking	at	the	situation	as	a	whole,	there	is	good	reason	to	think that	the	Protestant	Anglo-Saxons	are	not	only	losing	ground <i class="calibre4">relatively</i>,	but	must,	at	any	rate	in	the	East	and	middle	East,	be suffering	an	actual	decrease	on	a	large	scale.	For	it	has	been	shown	by more	than	one	sociologist	(see,	for	example,	the	statement	in	_The Family	and	the	Nation_)	that	no	stock	can	maintain	itself	with	an average	of	less	than	about	four	children	per	marriage,	and	from	all available	data	(it	has	not	been	found	possible	to	obtain	definite figures	for	most	of	the	Western	and	Southern	States)	we	must	see	that the	average	fertility	of	each	marriage	in	this	section	of	the	American people	falls	far	short	of	the	requisite	four	children.	Judging	by	all the	figures	at	hand,	the	modern	Anglo-Saxon	American,	with	his	high standard	of	comfort,	his	intensely	individualistic	outlook	on	life,	and his	intellectual	and	emancipated	but	child-refusing	wife,	is	being gradually	thrust	aside	by	the	upgrowth	of	new	masses	of	people	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>simpler	tastes	and	hardier	and	more	natural	habits.	And,	what	is	of peculiar	interest	to	us,	this	new	population	will	carry	into	ascendancy those	religious	and	moral	beliefs	which	have	moulded	its	type	of	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“The	victory	will	be,	not	to	those	religious	beliefs	which	most	closely correspond	to	certain	requirements	of	the	abstract	intellect,	but	to those	which	give	rise,	in	practice,	to	a	mode	of	life	that	is	simple, natural,	unselfish,	and	adequately	prolific—in	other	words,	to	a	mode of	life	that	 <i class="calibre4">works</i>,	that	is	 <i class="calibre4">Lebensf</i>� <i class="calibre4">hig</i>.”	[41]</p>
<p class="calibre1">As	things	are,	the	original	Protestant	stock	of	America	is	being	swamped	by	the growth	of	the	Catholic,	the	Jewish,	and	the	Negro	population.	Moreover,	the United	States	is	faced	by	the	grave	problem	of	a	rapidly	increasing	coloured race.	Despite	this	fact	the	American	Malthusians	are	now	demanding	that	a National	Bureau	should	be	established	to	disseminate	information	regarding contraceptives	throughout	their	country!	And	what	of	the	other	reformers?	They also	are	very	busy.	They	have	already	abolished	those	cheering	beverages	from grapes	and	grain,	or	rather	they	have	made	alcohol	one	of	the	surreptitious privileges	of	the	rich.	They	are	seeking	to	enforce	the	Sabbath	as	a	day	of absolute	rest,	not	for	the	glory	of	God	but	in	order	that	tired	wage-slaves	may have	their	strength	renewed	for	another	week	of	toil	in	the	factories	and	the mills.	Again,	they	would	uproot	from	the	homely	earth	that	pleasant	weed	whose leaves	have	made	slaves	of	millions	since	the	days	of	Sir	Walter	Raleigh.	All these	things	would	they	do.	There	are	some	things	the	reformers	have	not	done, and	these	things	are	recounted	by	an	American	writer,	Dr.	Anthony	M.	Benedik:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“The	divorce	peril,	the	race-suicide	evil,	the	greed	for	ill-gotten gold,	things	like	these	the	reformers	touch	not.	And	these	things	it	is</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>which	harm	the	soul.	Abolishing	the	use	of	alcoholic	drinks	and	of tobacco,	putting	the	blue	laws	into	effect,	suppressing	all	rough sports,	may	make	a	cleaner,	more	sanitary,	more	hygienic,	a	quieter world.	And	yet	there	keep	recurring	to	mind	those	words	of	the	Master of	mankind,	‘What	doth	it	profit	a	man	if	he	gain	the	world	and	suffer the	loss	of	his	soul?’	What	worthy	exchange	can	a	man	make	for	his soul?”	[42]</p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	other	hand,	it	is	good	to	read	that	the	Governor	of	New	York	has	recently signed	a	bill	making	it	a	misdemeanour	for	landlords	to	refuse	to	rent	apartments to	families	in	which	there	are	children.	In	that	State	children	thus	regain	equal rights	with	dogs,	cats,	and	canaries.	Is	it	too	much	to	ask	of	the	House	of Commons	that	they	should	pass	a	similar	law?	We	shall	see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	dangers	of	birth	control	were	apparent	to	that	great	American,	Theodore Roosevelt,	when	he	said:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“The	greatest	of	all	curses	is	the	curse	of	sterility,	and	the	severest of	all	condemnations	should	be	that	visited	upon	wilful	sterility.	The first	essential	in	any	civilisation	is	that	the	man	and	the	woman	shall be	the	father	and	the	mother	of	healthy	children,	so	that	the	race shall	increase	and	not	decrease.”	[43]</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	4.	THE	SAME	RESULTS	IN	ENGLAND</p>
<p class="calibre1">On	a	smaller	scale	the	position	is	the	same	in	England	and	Wales,	where Catholicism	has	probably	checked	to	some	extent	the	general	decline	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>birthrate.	In	1919	there	were	only	six	towns	in	England	[44]	with	a	birthrate	of over	25	per	1,000,	these	being	St.	Helens	(25.6),	Gateshead	(25.9),	South	Shields (26.9),	Sunderland	(27.1),	Tynemouth	(25.9),	and	Middlesbrough	(26.7).	Now	in these	towns	the	Catholic	element	is	very	strong.	During	the	same	year	in	the	four registration	counties	in	which	these	towns	are	situated,	a	larger	proportion	of marriages	were	celebrated	according	to	the	rites	of	the	Church	of	Rome	than	in the	other	counties	of	England	and	Wales.	[45]	The	actual	proportion	of	Catholic marriages	per	1,000	of	all	marriages	in	these	four	counties	was:	Lancashire	116, Durham	99,	Northumberland	92,	and	the	North	Riding	of	Yorkshire	92.	That gives	a	fair	index	of	the	strength	of	the	Catholic	population.	Again	in	1919	we find	that	Preston,	a	textile	town,	has	a	birthrate	of	17.1,	whereas	two	other	textile towns,	Bradford	and	Halifax,	have	rates	of	13.4	and	13.1	respectively:	and	there can	be	little	doubt	that	the	relative	superiority	of	Preston	is	mainly	owing	to	her large	Catholic	population. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	actual	birthrate	amongst	Catholics	in	England	may	be	estimated	from information	contained	in	 <i class="calibre4">The	Catholic	Directory</i>	for	1914.	As	that	work	gives the	Catholic	population	and	the	number	of	infant	baptisms	during	the	previous year	in	each	diocese	of	Great	Britain,	and	as	Catholic	children	are	always baptized	soon	after	birth,	it	is	possible	to	estimate	the	birthrate	of	the	Catholic population.	Working	on	these	figures	Professor	Meyrick	Booth	[46]	has published	the	following	table:</p>
<p class="calibre1">TABLE	VI</p>

<p class="calibre1">During	the	same	period	the	general	birthrate	amongst	the	whole	population	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>England	and	Wales	was	about	24	per	1,000.	And	figures	that	are	even	more remarkable	have	been	published	by	Mr.	W.C.D.	Whetham	and	Mrs.	Whetham. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[47]	These	writers,	having	investigated	the	number	of	children	in	the	families	of the	landed	gentry,	show	that	the	birthrate	amongst	the	aristocracy	has	declined. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“A	hundred	fertile	marriages	for	each	decade	from	1831	to	1890	have been	taken	consecutively	from	those	families	who	have	held	their	title to	nobility	for	at	least	two	preceding	generations,	thus	excluding	the more	modern	commercial	middle-class	element	in	the	present	Peerage, which	can	be	better	dealt	with	elsewhere.	We	then	get	the	full	effect of	hereditary	stability	and	a	secure	position,	and	do	away	with	any disturbing	influence	that	might	occur	from	a	sudden	rise	to prosperity.”	[48]</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	results	were	as	follows:	[Reference:	Population]</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Year.	Number	of	children	to	each</p>

<p class="calibre1">1881-90	3.13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	birthrate	amongst	thirty	families	of	the	landed	gentry,	who	were	known	to be	definitely	Catholic,	was	also	investigated,	with	the	following	results: Years.	Number	of	children	to	each</p>
<p class="calibre1">fertile	marriage. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">1871-90	6.6</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">(as	compared	with	3.74	for	the	landed	families	as	a	whole	during	the same	period.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	interpretation	of	these	figures	is	not	a	matter	of	faith,	but	of	reason.	I	submit that	the	facts	are	 <i class="calibre4">prima	facie</i>	evidence	that	by	observance	of	the	moral	law,	as taught	by	the	Catholic	Church,	even	a	highly	cultured	community	is	enabled	to escape	those	dangers	of	over-civilisation	that	lead	to	diminished	fertility	and consequently	to	national	decline. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	truth	of	this	statement	has	been	freely	acknowledged	by	many	Anglicans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">According	to	Canon	Edward	Lyttelton:	“The	discipline	of	the	Roman Communion	prohibits	the	artificial	prevention	of	conception,	hence	Ireland	is	the only	part	of	the	United	Kingdom	in	which	the	birthrate	has	not	declined,	and	the decline	is	least	in	places	like	Liverpool	and	those	districts	where	Roman Catholics	are	most	numerous.”	As	we	have	already	seen,	there	are	also	other reasons	why	Catholicism	preserves	the	fertility	of	a	nation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	wishing	to	hurt	the	feelings	of	the	most	sensitive	materialist,	it	is necessary	to	point	out	that,	apart	altogether	from	the	question	as	to	whether	the chief	or	immediate	cause	of	a	declining	birthrate	is	the	practice	of	artificial	birth control,	or,	as	seems	to	be	possible,	a	general	lowering	of	fertility,	birthrates	are more	dependent	on	morals	and	religion	than	on	race	and	country.	During	the	past</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a>century	irreligion	spread	throughout	France,	and	the	birthrate	fell	from	32.2, during	the	first	decade	of	the	nineteenth	century,	to	20.6,	during	the	first	ten years	of	the	twentieth	century.	In	America,	amongst	the	descendants	of	the	New England	Puritans	a	decay	of	religion	and	morals	has	also	been	accompanied	by	a dwindling	birthrate.	The	decline	of	the	original	New	England	stock	in	America has	been	masked	to	some	extent	by	the	high	birthrate	amongst	the	immigrant population;	but	nevertheless	it	is	apparent	in	the	Census	Returns	for	1890,	when a	population	of	65,000,000	was	expected	and	only	62,500,000	was	returned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover,	there	is	ample	evidence	in	history	that,	wherever	the	Christian	ideal	of a	family	has	been	abandoned,	a	race	is	neither	able	to	return	to	the	family	life	of healthy	pagan	civilisations	nor	to	escape	decay.	During	the	past	fifty	years	in England	family	life	has	been	definitely	weakened	by	increased	facilities	for divorce	amongst	the	rich,	by	the	discouragement	of	parental	authority	amongst the	poor,	and	by	the	neglect	of	all	religious	teaching	in	the	schools.	And	thus,	in the	words	of	Charles	Devas,	“We	have	of	late	years,	with	perverse	ingenuity, been	preparing	the	way	for	the	low	birthrate	of	irreligion	and	the	high	death-rate of	civil	disorder.”	[49]	The	birthrate	in	England	and	Wales	reached	its	highest point,	36.3,	in	1876,	and	has	gradually	fallen	to	18.5	in	1919.	During	the	first two	quarters	of	that	year	the	rate	was	the	lowest	yet	recorded.	During	the	pre-war	year,	1913,	the	rate	was	24.1. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	conclusion,	the	following	statements	by	a	Protestant	writer	are	of	interest:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Judging	from	a	number	of	figures	which	cannot	be	quoted	here,	owing	to considerations	of	space,	it	would	seem	that	the	English	middle-class birthrate	has	fallen	to	the	extent	of	 <i class="calibre4">over	50	per	cent</i>.	during	the last	forty	years;	and	we	have	actual	figures	showing	that	the well-to-do	artisan	birthrate	has	declined,	_in	the	last	thirty	years, by	52	per	cent.!_	Seeing	that	the	Protestant	Churches	draw	their members	mainly	from	these	very	classes,	we	have	not	far	to	seek	for	an explanation	of	the	empty	Sunday	Schools….” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Under	these	circumstances	it	is	not	in	the	least	necessary	for Protestant	ministers	and	clergymen	to	cast	about	them	for	evidence	of Jesuit	machinations	wherewith	to	explain	the	decline	of	the	Protestant Churches	in	this	country!	Let	them	rather	look	at	the	empty	cradles	in the	homes	of	their	own	congregations!”	[50]</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	author	of	the	above-quoted	paragraphs	thus	attributes	the	decline	both	of	the birthrate	and	of	the	Protestant	Churches	to	the	general	adoption	of	artificial	birth control.	With	that	explanation	I	disagree,	because	it	puts	the	horse	behind	the cart.	When	the	Protestant	faith	was	strong	the	birthrate	of	this	country	was	as high	as	that	of	Catholic	lands.	The	Protestant	Churches	have	now	been overshadowed	by	a	rebirth	of	Rationalism,	a	growth	for	which	they	themselves prepared	the	soil:	and	diminished	fertility	is	the	natural	product	of	a	civilisation tending	towards	materialism.	Although	the	practice	of	artificial	birth	control must	obviously	contribute	towards	a	falling	birthrate,	it	is	neither	the	only	nor the	ultimate	cause	of	the	decline.	The	ultimate	causes	of	a	falling	birthrate	are more	complex,	and	the	decline	of	a	community	is	but	the	physical	expression	of a	moral	change.	That	is	my	thesis. </p>

<p class="calibre1">IS	THERE	A	NATURAL	LAW	REGULATING	THE	PROPORTION	OF</p>
<p class="calibre1">BIRTHS	AND	DEATHS? </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	1.	THE	THEORY	OF	THOMAS	DOUBLEDAY	REVIVED</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	1837	Thomas	Doubleday	[51]	maintained	that	the	rising	birthrate	of	his	own time	was	closely	connected	with	the	fall	in	the	standard	of	living,	and	his argument	implied	that,	in	order	to	check	the	excessive	birthrate,	it	was	necessary to	improve	the	condition	of	the	mass	of	the	people.	Four	years	later	he	published <i class="calibre4">The	True	Law	of	Population</i>,	wherein	he	stated	that	when	the	existence	of	a species	is	endangered—</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“A	corresponding	effort	is	invariably	made	by	Nature	for	its preservation	and	continuance	by	an	increase	of	fertility,	and	that	this especially	takes	place	whenever	such	danger	arises	from	a	diminution	of proper	nourishment	or	food,	so	that	consequently	the	state	of	depletion or	the	deplethoric	state	is	favourable	to	fertility,	and	that,	on	the other	hand,	the	plethoric	state,	or	state	of	repletion,	is	unfavourable to	fertility	in	the	ratio	of	the	intensity	of	each	state.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	a	series	of	experiments	on	plants	Doubleday	discovered	that	“whatever	might be	the	principle	of	manure,  <i class="calibre4">an	overdose</i>	of	it	invariably	induced	sterility	in	the plant.”	Although	his	formula	is	deficient	in	that	food	is	selected	as	the	one	factor in	environment	which	influences	fertility,	and	although	it	may	be	an overstatement	to	claim	that	fertility	varies	in	exact	proportion	to	abundance	or	to scarcity,	nevertheless	his	formula	contains	an	important	truth	which	literally</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p63"></a>knocks	the	bottom	out	of	the	whole	Malthusian	case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	a	sad	reflection	that,	while	the	falsehoods	of	Malthus	have	been	blindly accepted	for	the	greater	part	of	a	century,	the	work	of	Doubleday	was	almost	lost in	oblivion.	His	shade	has	now	been	recalled	to	the	full	centre	of	the	stage,	and for	this	the	credit	is	due	to	Mr.	C.E.	Pell.	His	recent	book	[52]	is	a	stimulating essay	on	the	declining	birthrate,	and	contains	much	evidence	that	supports	the main	contention	of	Doubleday.	Although	it	is	impossible	to	agree	with	all	the deductions	made	by	Mr.	Pell,	he	has	nevertheless	done	a	public	service	by restating	the	problem	of	the	birthrate	in	a	new	way,	by	effectively	bursting	the Malthusian	bubble,	and	by	tabulating	fresh	evidence	against	the	birth-controllers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	2.	MR.	PELL’S	GENERALISATIONS	CRITICISED</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Pell	defines	the	law	of	births	and	deaths	in	two	generalisations.	The	first	is:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	have	seen	that	it	is	a	necessary	condition	of	the	success	of	the	evolutionary scheme	that	the	variation	of	the	inherited	potential	degree	of	fertility	between species	and	species	must	bear	an	inverse	proportion	to	their	capacity	for survival.”	[53]	At	first	glance	this	statement	appears	hard	to	be	understood;	but	it is	obviously	true—because	it	means	that	a	species	that	is	well	adapted	to	its environment	can	survive	with	a	low	degree	of	fertility,	whereas	a	species	that	is not	well	adapted	to	its	environment	requires	a	high	degree	of	fertility	in	order	to survive.	Mr.	Pell	considers	that	a	“capacity	for	survival”	is	synonymous	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">“nervous	energy”;	but,	as	our	total	knowledge	of	nervous	energy	is	limited	to	the fact	that	it	is	neither	matter	nor	any	known	force,	the	change	in	words	does	not mark	a	real	advance	in	knowledge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	second	generalisation	is	that	“the	variation	of	the	degree	of	animal	fertility in	response	to	the	direct	action	of	the	environment	shall	bear	an	inverse proportion	to	the	variation	of	the	survival	capacity	under	that	environment.”	[54]</p>
<p class="calibre1">Here	Mr.	Pell	and	I	part	company.	I	have	already	(Chapter	III)	disputed	the causal	connection	between	birthrate	and	death-rate	which	Mr.	Pell	here	asserts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	generalisation	is	made	by	assuming	that	birthrates	and	death-rates	rise	and fall	together:	that	conditions	which	produce	a	high	death-rate	will	also	produce	a high	birthrate	and	that	conditions	which	cause	a	low	death-rate	will	also	cause	a low	birthrate;	that	the	increase	or	decline	of	a	population	is	due	to	the	direct</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>action	of	the	environment;	and	finally	that	“the	 <i class="calibre4">actual</i>	degree	of	fertility	is decided	by	the	direct	action	of	the	environment.”	[55]	On	that	last	rock	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pell’s	barque	sinks.	The	mistake	here	is	analogous	to	the	old	Darwinian	fallacy, abandoned	by	Huxley	and	by	Romanes,	that	natural	selection	is	a	creative	cause of	new	species.	Even	if	the	hypothesis	of	evolution—and	it	is	merely	a hypothesis—be	accepted,	the	only	view	warranted	by	reason	is	that	variation	of species	and	their	actual	degree	of	fertility	may	be	produced,	not	by	the	direct action	of	environment,	but	by	the	 <i class="calibre4">reaction</i>	of	species	to	their	environment—a very	different	story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	is	no	statistical	evidence	to	prove	a	uniform	correspondence	between birthrates	and	death-rates,	and	it	is	improbable	that	there	should	be	a	physical law	of	nature	whose	operations	cannot	be	demonstrated	by	mathematical	proof. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover,	we	know	that	the	same	conditions	which	cause	a	high	birthrate	may cause	a	low	death-rate.	In	the	case	of	the	first	settlers	in	a	new	country	the	death-rate	is	low	because	the	diseases	of	civilisation	are	absent	and	the	settlers	are usually	young,	whereas	the	birthrate	is	high.	If	fifty	young	married	couples	settle on	the	virgin	soil	of	a	new	country	it	is	probable	that	for	many	years	an enormous	birthrate,	of	over	100,	will	coexist	with	a	low	death-rate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	reality	a	high	birthrate	may	coexist	with	a	low	death-rate,	or	with	a	high death-rate.	For	example,	there	is	a	difference	between	natural	and	artificial poverty,	the	first	being	brought	about	by	God,	or,	if	any	reader	prefers	to	have	it so,	by	Nature,	and	the	second	being	made	by	man.	Under	conditions	of	natural poverty	small	groups	of	people	in	an	open	country	are	surrounded	by	land	not yet	cultivated:	whereas	artificial	poverty	means	a	population	overcrowded	and underfed,	living	in	dark	tenements	or	in	back-to-back	houses,	breathing	foul	air in	ill-ventilated	rooms	seldom	lit	by	the	sun,	working	long	hours	in	gas-lit workshops	for	a	sweated	wage,	buying	the	cheapest	food	in	the	dearest	market, and	drugged	by	bad	liquor.	In	either	case	their	existence	is	threatened,	although for	very	different	reasons,	and	the	birthrate	rises;	but	under	conditions	of	natural poverty	the	death-rate	is	low,	whereas	in	slums	the	death-rate	is	high. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	3.	THE	LAW	OF	DECLINE</p>
<p class="calibre1">It	would	appear,	then,	that	under	conditions	of	hardship	the	birthrate	tends	to rise,	and	that	in	circumstances	of	ease	the	birthrate	tends	to	fall.	If	the	existence</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a>of	the	inhabitants	in	a	closed	country	is	threatened	by	scarcity,	the	birthrate	tends to	rise.	For	example,	“In	some	of	the	remote	parts	of	the	country,	Orkney	and Shetland,	the	population	remained	practically	stationary	between	the	years	1801</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	1811,	and	in	the	next	ten	years,	still	years	of	great	scarcity,	it	increased	15</p>
<p class="calibre1">per	cent.”	[56]</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	governing	principle	may	be	expressed	in	the	following	generalisation.	When the	existence	of	a	community	is	threatened	by	adversity	the	birthrate	tends	to rise;	but	when	the	existence	of	a	community	is	threatened	by	prosperity	the birthrate	tends	to	fall.	By	adversity	I	mean	war,	famine,	scarcity,	poverty, oppression,	an	untilled	soil,	and	disease:	and	by	prosperity	I	mean	wealth, luxury,	idleness,	a	diet	too	rich—especially	in	flesh	meat—and	over-civilisation, whereby	the	physical	laws	of	nature	are	defied.	Now	the	danger	of	national decline	owing	to	prosperity	can	be	avoided	by	a	nation	that	observes	the	moral law,	and	this	is	the	most	probable	explanation	of	the	fact	that	in	Ireland,	although the	general	prosperity	of	the	people	has	rapidly	increased	since	George Wyndham	displaced	landlordism	over	a	large	area	by	small	ownership,	the birthrate	has	continued	to	rise.	Moreover,	the	danger	to	national	existence,	as	we have	already	indicated	(Chapter	I,	Section.	10)	is	greater	from	moral	than	from physical	catastrophes,	and	when	both	catastrophes	are	threatened	the	ultimate issue	depends	upon	which	of	the	two	is	the	greater.	Furthermore,	it	would	appear that	moral	catastrophes	inevitably	lead	to	physical	catastrophes.	This	is	best illustrated	by	the	fate	of	ancient	Greece. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	4.	ILLUSTRATED	FROM	GREEK	HISTORY	[Reference:	Dangers]</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	appositeness	of	this	illustration	arises	from	the	fact	that	ancient	Greece reached	a	very	high	level	of	material	and	intellectual	civilisation,	yet	perished owing	to	moral	and	physical	disasters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(a)	 <i class="calibre4">Moral	Catastrophe	in	Ancient	Greece</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	evidence	of	the	moral	catastrophe	is	to	be	found	in	the	change	that	occurred in	the	Greek	character	most	definitely	after	the	fourth	century	before	Christ.	Of this	Mr.	W.H.S.	Jones	has	given	the	following	account:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>“Gradually	the	Greeks	lost	their	brilliance,	which	had	been	as	the bright	freshness	of	early	youth.	This	is	painfully	obvious	in	their literature,	if	not	in	other	forms	of	art.	Their	initiative	vanished; they	ceased	to	create	and	began	to	comment.	Patriotism,	with	rare exceptions,	became	an	empty	name,	for	few	had	the	high	spirit	and energy	to	translate	into	action	man’s	duty	to	the	State.	Vacillation, indecision,	fitful	outbursts	of	unhealthy	activity	followed	by	cowardly depression,	selfish	cruelty,	and	criminal	weakness	are	characteristic of	the	public	life	of	Greece	from	the	struggle	with	Macedonia	to	the final	conquest	by	the	arms	of	Rome.	No	one	can	fail	to	be	struck	by	the marked	difference	between	the	period	from	Marathon	to	the	Peloponnesian War	and	the	period	from	Alexander	to	Mummius.	Philosophy	also	suffered, and	became	deeply	pessimistic	even	in	the	hands	of	its	best	and	noblest exponents.	‘Absence	of	feeling,’	‘absence	of	care’—such	were	the highest	goals	of	human	endeavour. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“How	far	this	change	was	due	to	other	causes	is	a	complicated	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	population	may	have	suffered	from	foreign	admixture	during	the troubled	times	that	followed	the	death	of	Alexander.	There	were, however,	many	reasons	against	the	view	that	these	disturbances	produced any	appreciable	difference	of	race.	The	presence	of	vast	numbers	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a>slaves,	not	members	of	households,	but	the	gangs	of	toilers	whom	the increase	of	commerce	brought	into	the	country,	pandered	to	a	foolish pride	that	looked	upon	many	kinds	of	honourable	labour	as	being shameful	and	unbecoming	to	a	free	man.	The	very	institution	that	made Greek	civilisation	possible	encouraged	idleness,	luxury,	and	still worse	vices.	Unnatural	vice,	which	in	some	States	seems	to	have	been positively	encouraged,	was	prevalent	among	the	Greeks	to	an	almost incredible	extent.	It	is	hard	not	to	believe	that	much	physical	harm was	caused	thereby;	of	the	loss	to	moral	strength	and	vigour	there	is no	need	to	speak.	The	city-state,	again,	however	favourable	to	the development	of	public	spirit	and	a	sense	of	responsibility,	was	doomed to	fail	in	a	struggle	against	the	stronger	Powers	of	Macedon	and	Rome. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	growth	of	the	scientific	spirit	destroyed	the	old	religion.	The more	intellectual	tried	to	find	principles	of	conduct	in	philosophy; the	ignorant	or	half-educated,	deprived	of	the	strong	moral	support that	always	comes	from	sharing	the	convictions	of	those	abler	and	wiser than	oneself,	fell	back	upon	degrading	superstitions.	In	either	case there	was	a	serious	loss	of	that	spirit	of	self-sacrifice	and	devotion which	a	vigorous	religious	faith	alone	can	bestow.	Without	such	a spirit,	as	history	proves	conclusively,	no	nation	or	people	can survive.”	[57]</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>(b)	 <i class="calibre4">The	Physical	Catastrophe	induced	by	Selfishness</i> One	of	the	physical	catastrophes	that	probably	most	accelerated	the	fall	of	Greek civilisation	was	malarial	fever.	The	parasite	of	this	disease	is	carried	from	man	to man	by	Anopheline	mosquitoes.	These	insects,	during	the	stage	of	egg,	larva, and	nympha,	live	in	water,	and	afterwards,	as	developed	insects,	in	the	air.	The breeding-grounds,	where	the	eggs	are	laid,	are	shallow	pools	of	stagnant	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	that	reason	the	disease	is	most	common	in	marshy	country,	and	tends	to disappear	when	the	land	is	properly	drained.	Of	this	we	have	an	example	in England,	whence	malaria	disappeared	as	the	marshes	were	drained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	Homer	there	is	a	disputed	reference	to	malaria,	but	it	is	not	possible	to ascertain	whether	the	disease	was	present	during	the	rise	of	Greek	civilisation, and	there	are	no	references	to	this	disease	in	the	literature	from	700	B.C.	to	550</p>
<p class="calibre1">B.C.	[58]	From	this	date	references	to	malaria	gradually	become	more	frequent, and	Hippocrates	stated	that	“those	who	live	in	low,	moist,	hot	districts,	and	drink the	stagnant	water,	of	necessity	suffer	from	enlarged	spleen.	They	are	stunted and	ill-shaped,	fleshy	and	dark,	bilious	rather	than	phlegmatic.	Their	nature	is	to be	cowardly	and	adverse	from	hardship;	but	good	discipline	can	improve	their character	in	this	respect.”	[59]	After	an	exhaustive	study	of	the	literature,	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jones	concludes	“that	malaria	was	endemic	throughout	the	greater	part	of	the Greek	world	by	400	B.C.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Concerning	the	causes	of	a	malarial	epidemic,	Sir	Ronald	Ross	writes:	[60]</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Suppose	that	the	Anophelines	have	been	present	from	the	first,	but	that	the number	of	infected	immigrants	has	been	few.	Then,	possibly,	some	of	these people	have	happened	to	take	up	their	abode	in	places	where	the	mosquitoes	are rare;	others	may	have	recovered	quickly;	others	may	not	have	chanced	to	possess parasites	in	suitable	stages	when	they	have	been	bitten.	Thus,	the	probability	of their	spreading	infection	would	be	very	small.	Or,	supposing	even	that	some	few new	infections	have	been	caused,	yet,	by	our	rough	calculations	in	section	12, <i class="calibre4">unless	the	mosquitoes	are	sufficiently	numerous</i>	in	the	locality,	the	little	epidemic may	die	out	after	a	while—for	instance,	during	the	cool	season.”	The	italics	are mine,	because	some	writers	have	suggested	that	the	decline	of	Greece	was	 <i class="calibre4">due</i>	to malaria,	whereas	I	submit,	as	the	more	logical	interpretation	of	the	facts,	that	a moral	catastrophe	led	to	the	neglect	of	agriculture,	whereby	the	area	of	marshy land	became	more	extensive,	mosquitoes	more	numerous,	and	the	fever	more prevalent. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a>In	view	of	the	foregoing	facts,	the	following	Malthusian	statement,	although groundless,	is	nevertheless	an	amusing	example	of	the	errors	that	arise	from	lack of	a	little	knowledge:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“The	difficulty	of	providing	for	a	high	birthrate	in	a	settled community	was	appreciated	by	the	ancient	Greeks,	notably	by	Plato	and Aristotle;	but	their	conclusions	were	swept	aside	by	the	warlike	spirit of	Rome,	and	the	sentimentality	of	Christianity,	so	that	only	a	few isolated	thinkers	showed	any	appreciation	of	them.”	[61]</p>

<p class="calibre1">Birth	controllers	claim	that	the	fall	in	the	English	birthrate,	which	began	to decline	in	1876,	is	mostly	due	to	the	use	of	contraceptives:	but	the	very	fact	that this	claim	is	made	by	these	reckless	propagandists	makes	it	imperative	that	we should	scrutinise	the	evidence	very	carefully. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Section	1.	NOT,	AS	MALTHUSIANS	ASSERT,	DUE	MAINLY	TO</p>
<p class="calibre1">CONTRACEPTIVES</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	support	of	the	Malthusian	contention,	Dr.	C.V.	Drysdale,	who	is	not	a	doctor of	medicine	but	a	doctor	of	science,	has	published	the	following	statements:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“…	We	might	note	that	a	recent	investigation	of	the	records	of	the Quakers	(the	Society	of	Friends)	reveals	the	fact	that	family limitation	has	been	adopted	by	them	to	a	most	astonishing	extent.	Their birthrate	[_sic_]	stood	at	20	per	thousand	in	1876,	and	has	now actually	fallen	to	about	8	per	thousand.	The	longevity	of	Quakers	is well	known,	and	the	returns	of	deaths	given	by	their	Society	show	that the	great	majority	live	to	between	seventy	and	ninety	years.	Infantile mortality	is	practically	unknown	among	them,	although	none	of	the special	steps	so	dear	to	most	social	reformers	have	been	taken	for	the protection	of	infant	life.	The	Quakers	are	well	known	to	be	very</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>earnest	Christians,	and	to	give	the	best	example	of	religious	morality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	probity	in	business	and	their	self-sacrifice	in	humanitarian	work of	all	kinds	are	renowned.	Yet	it	would	seem	that	they	have	adopted family	restriction	to	a	greater	extent	than	any	other	body	of	people, and,	since	the	decline	of	their	birthrate	only	began	in	1876,	that	it is	due	to	adoption	of	preventive	methods.”	[62]</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again,	he	translates	the	following	quotation	from	a	Swiss	author:</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Comment	on	the	above	is	superfluous,”	adds	Dr.	C.V.	Drysdale,	and	with	that remark	most	people	will	cordially	disagree.	The	obvious	interpretation	of	the foregoing	figures	is	that	there	has	been	a	decline	in	natural	fertility	amongst</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a>highly	educated	and	civilised	people.	But	that	interpretation	does	not	suit	Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drysdale’s	book,	and	hence	we	have	the	disgraceful	spectacle	of	a	writer	who,	in order	to	bolster	up	an	argument	which	is	rotten	from	beginning	to	end,	does	not hesitate	to	launch	without	a	particle	of	evidence	a	charge	of	gross	hypocrisy against	the	Quakers	of	England,	a	body	of	men	and	women	who	in	peace	and	in war	have	proved	the	sincerity	of	their	faith,	and	against	four	hundred	and seventy	respected	citizens	of	Paris.	Further	comment	on	 <i class="calibre4">that</i>	is	superfluous.	At the	same	time	it	is	obvious	that,	in	so	far	as	their	pernicious	propaganda	spreads and	is	adopted,	Malthusians	may	claim	to	contribute	to	the	fall	of	the	birthrate, and	towards	the	decline	of	the	Empire. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	2.	DECLINE	IN	FERTILITY	DUE	TO	SOME	NATURAL	LAW</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	course	of	an	inquiry	on	the	fertility	of	women	who	had	received	a	college education,	the	National	Birth	Rate	Commission	[63]	attempted	to	discover	to what	extent	birth	control	was	practised	amongst	the	middle	and	professional classes.	Of	those	amongst	whom	the	inquiry	was	made	477	gave	definite answers,	from	which	it	was	ascertained	that	289,	or	60	per	cent.,	consciously limited	their	families,	or	attempted	to	do	so;	and	that	188,	or	40	per	cent.	made no	attempt	to	limit	their	families.	Amongst	those	who	limited	their	families	183</p>
<p class="calibre1">stated	the	means	employed,	and	of	these,	105,	or	57	per	cent.,	practised continence,	whilst	78,	or	43	per	cent.,	used	artificial	or	unnatural	methods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	comes	a	most	extraordinary	fact.	Dr.	Major	Greenwood,	[64]	a	statistician whose	methods	are	beyond	question,	discovered	that	there	was	no	real mathematical	difference	between	the	number	of	children	in	the	“limited” </p>
<p class="calibre1">families	and	the	number	in	the	unlimited	families.	In	both	groups	of	families	the number	of	children	was	smaller	than	the	average	family	in	the	general population,	and	in	both	groups	there	were	fewer	children	than	in	the	families	of the	preceding	generation	to	which	the	parents	belonged.	Dr.	Greenwood	states that	this	is	 <i class="calibre4">prima	facie</i>	evidence	that	deliberate	birth	control	has	produced	little effect,	and	that	the	lowered	fertility	is	the	expression	of	a	natural	change. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless,	he	holds	that	the	latter	explanation	cannot	be	accepted	as	wholly proved	on	the	evidence,	owing	to	certain	defects	in	the	data	on	which	his calculations	were	based. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a>“I	am	of	opinion	that	we	should	hesitate	before	adopting	that interpretation	in	view	of	the	cogent	indirect	evidence	afforded	by other	data	that	the	fall	of	the	birthrate	is	differential,	and	that the	differentiation	is	largely	economic.	There	are	at	least	two considerations	which	must	be	borne	in	mind	in	connection	with	these schedules.	The	first	is,	that	all	the	marriages	described	as	unlimited may	not	have	been	so.	I	do	not	suggest	that	the	answers	are intentionally	false,	but	it	is	possible	that	many	may	have	considered that	limitation	implied	the	use	of	mechanical	means;	that	marriages	in which	the	parties	merely	abstained	from,  <i class="calibre4">or	limited	the	occasions	of</i>, sexual	intercourse	may	have	frequently	entered	as	of	unrestricted fertility.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	above	italics	are	mine,	because,	if	that	surmise	be	correct,	it	goes	to	prove that	the	restriction	of	intercourse	to	certain	periods,	which	restriction	the	married may	lawfully	practise,	is	as	efficacious	in	limiting	the	size	of	a	family	as	are those	artificial	methods	of	birth	control	contrary	both	to	natural	and	to	Christian morality.	Dr.	Major	Greenwood	continues	as	follows:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“In	the	second	place,	the	schedules	do	not	provide	us	with	information as	to	when	limitation	was	introduced.	We	are	told,	for	instance,	that the	size	of	the	family	was	five	and	that	its	number	was	limited.	This may	mean	 <i class="calibre4">either</i>	that	throughout	the	duration	of	the	marriage preventive	measures	were	adopted	from	time	to	time,  <i class="calibre4">or</i>	that	 <i class="calibre4">after</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a>five	children	had	been	born	fertile	intercourse	was	stopped.	In	the absence	of	detailed	information	on	this	point	it	is	plainly	impossible to	form	an	accurate	judgment	as	to	the	effect	of	limitation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	are,	therefore,	no	accurate	figures	to	indicate	the	extent	to	which	birth control	has	contributed	to	the	decline	in	the	birthrate. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	3.	AND	TO	CHARACTER	OF	OCCUPATION</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover	the	claim	of	birth	controllers,	that	the	decline	in	the	English	birthrate is	mainly	due	to	the	use	of	contraceptives,	is	rendered	highly	improbable	by	the fact	that	the	Registrar-General	[65]	has	shown	that	in	1911	the	birthrate	in different	classes	varied	according	to	the	occupation	of	the	fathers.	The	figures are	these:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Births	per	1,000	married</p>
<p class="calibre1">Social	Class.	males	aged	under	55,	including</p>
<p class="calibre1">retired. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">1.	Unskilled	workmen	213</p>
<p class="calibre1">2.	Intermediate	class	158</p>
<p class="calibre1">3.	Skilled	workmen	153</p>
<p class="calibre1">4.	Intermediate	132</p>
<p class="calibre1">5.	Upper	and	middle	class	119</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus,	ascending	the	social	scale,	we	find,	in	class	upon	class,	that	as	the	annual income	increases	the	number	of	children	in	the	family	diminishes,	until	we	come</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>to	the	old	English	nobility	of	whom,	according	to	Darwin,	19	per	cent.	are childless.	These	last	have	every	reason	to	wish	for	heirs	to	inherit	their	titles	and what	land	and	wealth	they	possess,	and,	as	their	record	in	war	proves	them	to	be no	cowards’	breed,	it	would	be	a	monstrous	indictment	to	maintain	that	their childlessness	is	mostly	due	to	the	use	of	contraceptives.	If	 <i class="calibre4">all</i>	these	results	arose from	the	practice	of	birth	control,	it	would	imply	a	crescendo	of	general	national selfishness	unparalleled	in	the	history	of	humanity.	No,	it	is	not	possible	to	give Neo-Malthusians	credit,	even	for	all	the	evil	they	claim	to	have	achieved. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	4.	AGGRAVATED	DOUBTLESS	BY	MALTHUSIANISM</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless,	artificial	birth	control	is	an	evil	and	too	prevalent	thing.	My contention	is	that	the	primary	cause	of	our	falling	birthrate	is	over-civilisation; one	of	the	most	evil	products	of	this	over-civilisation,	whereby	simple,	natural, and	unselfish	ideals,	based	on	the	assumption	that	national	security	depends	on the	moral	and	economic	strength	of	family	life,	have	been	replaced	largely	by	a complicated,	artificial,	and	luxurious	individualism;	and	that	diminished	fertility, apart	from	the	practice	of	artificial	birth	control,	is	a	result	of	luxurious individualism.	Even	if	it	be	so,	one	of	the	most	evil	products	of	over-civilisation is	the	use	of	contraceptives,	because	this	practice,	more	than	any	other	factor	in social	life,	hastens,	directly	and	indirectly,	the	fall	of	a	declining	birthrate;	and artificial	birth	control,	to	the	extent	to	which	it	is	practised,	therefore	aggravates the	consequences	of	a	law	of	decline	already	apparent	in	our	midst.	I	have already	said	that	restriction	of	intercourse,	as	held	lawful	by	the	Catholic Church,	is	possibly	as	efficacious	in	limiting	the	size	of	a	family	as	are	artificial methods.	If	any	man	shall	say	that	therefore	there	is	no	difference	between	these methods,	let	him	read	the	fuller	explanation	given	in	another	connection	on	p. </p>
<p class="calibre1">153.	(See	[Reference:	Explanation])	The	method	which	reason	and	morality alike	permit	is	devoid	of	all	those	evils,	moral,	psychological,	and	physiological, that	follow	the	use	of	contraceptives. </p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	1.	NOT	A	PHYSICAL	BENEFIT</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Birth	control	is	alleged	to	be	beneficial	for	men	and	women,	and	these	“benefits” </p>
<p class="calibre1">are	no	less	amazing	than	the	fallacies	on	which	this	practice	is	advocated.	At	the Obstetric	Section	of	the	Royal	Society	of	Medicine	in	1921	the	leading physicians	on	diseases	of	women	condemned	the	use	of	contraceptives.	[66]</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">A	Cause	of	Sterility</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	R.A.	Gibbons,	Physician	to	the	Grosvenor	Hospital	for	Women,	said that	nowadays	it	was	common	for	a	young	married	woman	to	ask	her medical	man	for	advice	as	to	the	best	method	of	preventing	conception. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	test	of	relative	sterility	was	the	rapidity	with	which	conception takes	place.	He	had	made	confidential	inquiries	in	120	marriages.	In 100	cases	preventive	measures	had	been	used	at	one	time	or	another,	and the	number	of	children	was	well	under	2	per	marriage.	In	Paris	some time	ago	the	birthrate	was	104	per	1,000	in	the	poorer	quarters	and only	34	in	a	rich	quarter	of	the	city;	in	London	comparative	figures</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a>had	been	given	as	195	and	63	in	poor	and	in	rich	quarters.	These	and similar	figures	showed	that	women	living	in	comfort	and	luxury	did	not want	to	be	bothered	with	confinements.	It	had	been	said	that	the	degree of	sterility	could	be	regarded	as	an	index	to	the	morals	of	a	race. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Congenital	sterility	was	rare,	but	the	number	of	children	born	in England	was	decreasing.	It	had	been	estimated	that	one-third	of	the pregnancies	in	several	great	cities	abroad	aborted.	Dr.	Gibbons	then quoted	figures	given	by	Douglas	Wight	and	Amand	Routh	to	show	the	high percentage	of	abortions	and	stillbirths.	In	his	opinion	it	was	the	duty of	medical	men	to	point	out	to	the	public	that	physiological	laws	could not	be	broken	with	impunity.	It	had	been	observed	that	if	the	doe	were withheld	from	the	buck	at	oestral	periods	atrophy	of	the	ovary	took place.	In	this	connection	Dr.	Gibbons	recalled	a	large	number	of patients	who	had	used	contraceptives	in	early	married	life,	and subsequently	had	longed	in	vain	for	a	child.	This	applied	also	to	those who	had	decided,	after	the	first	baby,	to	have	no	more	children,	and had	subsequently	regretted	their	decision. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Neuroses</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Professor	McIlroy,	of	the	London	School	of	Medicine	for	Women,	deplored</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a>the	amount	of	time	spent	on	attempting	to	cure	sterility	when contraceptives	were	so	largely	used.	The	fact	that	neuroses	were largely	the	result	of	the	use	of	contraceptives	should	be	made	widely known,	and	also	that	in	women	the	maternal	passion	was	even	stronger, though	it	might	develop	later,	than	sexual	passion,	and	would ultimately	demand	satisfaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Fibroid	Tumours</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Arthur	E.	Giles,	Senior	Surgeon	to	the	Chelsea	Hospital	for	Women, endorsed	Dr.	Gibbons’s	remarks	as	to	the	great	unhappiness	resulting from	deliberately	childless	marriages,	and	he	added	that	he	had	always warned	patients	of	this.	He	believed	that	quinine	had	a	permanently	bad effect.	Those	who	waited	for	a	convenient	season	to	have	a	child	often laid	up	trouble	for	themselves.	On	the	question	of	fibroid	tumours	he had	come	to	the	conclusion	that	these	were	not	a	cause	but	in	a	sense	a consequence	of	sterility.	Women	who	were	subjected	to	sexual	excitement with	no	physiological	outlet	appear	to	have	a	tendency	to	develop fibroids.	He	would	like	the	opinion	to	go	forth	from	the	section	that the	use	of	contraceptives	was	a	bad	thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	these	authorities	are	agreed	that	the	practice	of	artificial	sterility	during	early</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>married	life	is	the	cause	of	many	women	remaining	childless,	although	later	on these	women	wish	in	vain	for	children.	To	meet	this	difficulty	one	of	the advocates	of	birth	control	advises	all	young	couples	to	make	sure	of	some children	before	adopting	these	practices;	thus	demanding	of	young	parents,	at	the very	time	when	it	is	most	irksome,	that	very	sacrifice	of	personal	comfort	and prosperity	to	prevent	which	is	the	precise	object	of	the	vicious	practice.	Nor	is sterility	the	only	penalty.	The	disease	known	as	neurasthenia	arises	both	in women	 <i class="calibre4">and	in	men</i>	in	consequence	of	these	methods.	Dr.	Mary	Sharlieb,	[67]</p>
<p class="calibre1">after	forty	years’	experience	of	diseases	of	women,	writes	as	follows:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,	on	the	surface	of	things,	it	would	seem	as	if	a	knowledge	of	how to	prevent	the	too	rapid	increase	of	a	family	would	be	a	boon	to over-prolific	and	heavily	burdened	mothers.	There	are,	however,	certain reasons	which	probably	convert	the	supposed	advantage	into	a	very	real disadvantage.	An	experience	of	well	over	forty	years	convinces	me	that the	artificial	limitation	of	the	family	causes	damage	to	a	woman’s nervous	system.	The	damage	done	is	likely	to	show	itself	in	inability to	conceive	when	the	restriction	voluntarily	used	is	abandoned	because the	couple	desire	offspring. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	for	many	years	asked	women	who	came	to	me	desiring	children whether	they	have	ever	practised	prevention,	and	they	very	frequently tell	me	that	they	did	so	during	the	early	days	of	their	married	life because	they	thought	that	their	means	were	not	adequate	to	the	support of	a	family.	Subsequently	they	found	that	conception,	thwarted	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>time	that	desire	was	present,	fails	to	occur	when	it	becomes convenient.	In	such	cases,	even	although	examination	of	the	pelvic organ	shows	nothing	abnormal,	all	one’s	endeavours	to	secure	conception frequently	go	unrewarded.	Sometimes	such	a	woman	is	not	only	sterile, but	nervous,	and	in	generally	poor	health;	but	the	more	common occurrence	is	that	she	remains	fairly	well	until	the	time	of	the	change of	life,	when	she	frequently	suffers	more,	on	the	nervous	side,	than does	the	woman	who	has	lived	a	natural	married	life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	late	Dr.	F.W.	Taylor,	President	of	the	British	Gynaecological	Society,	wrote as	follows	in	1904:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Artificial	prevention	is	an	evil	and	a	disgrace.	The	immorality	of	it, the	degradation	of	succeeding	generations	by	it,	their	domination	or subjection	by	strangers	who	are	stronger	because	they	have	not	given way	to	it,	the	curses	that	must	assuredly	follow	the	parents	of decadence	who	started	it,—all	of	this	needs	to	be	brought	home	to	the minds	of	those	who	have	thoughtlessly	or	ignorantly	accepted	it,	for	it is	to	this	undoubtedly	that	we	have	to	attribute	not	only	the diminishing	birthrate,	but	the	diminishing	value	of	our	population. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“It	would	be	strange	indeed	if	so	unnatural	a	practice,	one	so</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a>destructive	of	the	best	life	of	the	nation,	should	bring	no	danger	or disease	in	its	wake,	and	I	am	convinced,	after	many	years	of observation,	that	both	sudden	danger	and	chronic	disease	may	be produced	by	the	methods	of	prevention	very	generally	employed….	The natural	deduction	is	that	the	artificial	production	of	modern	times, the	relatively	sterile	marriage,	is	an	evil	thing,	even	to	the individuals	primarily	concerned,	injurious	not	only	to	the	race,	but	to those	who	accept	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	the	opinion	of	a	distinguished	gynaecologist,	who	also	happened	to	be a	Christian.	The	reader	may	protest	that	the	latter	fact	is	entirely	irrelevant	to	my argument,	and	that	the	value	of	a	man’s	observations	concerning	disease	is	to	be judged	by	his	skill	and	experience	as	a	physician,	and	not	by	his	religious beliefs.	A	most	reasonable	statement.	Unhappily,	the	Neo-Malthusians	think otherwise.	They	would	have	us	believe	that	because	this	man	was	a	Christian	his opinion,	as	a	gynaecologist,	is	worthless.	C.V.	Drysdale,	O.B.E.,	D.	Sc.,	after quoting	Dr.	Taylor’s	views,	adds	the	following	foot-note:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	since	learnt	that	Dr.	Taylor	was	a	very	earnest	Christian,	and the	author	of	several	sacred	hymns	and	of	a	pious	work,	_The	Coming	of the	Saints_.”	[68]</p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore,	in	1905,	the	South-Western	Branch	of	the	British	Medical Association	passed	the	following	resolution:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“That	this	Branch	is	of	opinion	that	the	growing	use	of	contraceptives and	ecbolics	is	fraught	with	great	danger	both	to	the	individual	and	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a>the	race.	That	this	Branch	is	of	opinion	that	the	advertisements	and sale	of	such	appliances	and	substances,	as	well	as	the	publication	and dissemination	of	literature	relating	thereto,	should	be	made	a	penal offence.”	[69]</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	2.	A	SCANDALOUS	SUGGESTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	foregoing	opinions	are	very	distasteful	to	Neo-Malthusians,	and	these people,	being	unable	apparently	to	give	a	reasoned	answer,	do	not	hesitate	to suggest	that	medical	opposition,	when	not	due	to	religious	bias,	is	certainly	due to	mercenary	motives. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“As	the	Church	has	a	vested	interest	in	souls,	so	the	medical profession	has	a	vested	interest	in	bodies.	Birth	is	a	source	of revenue,	direct	and	indirect.	It	means	maternity	fees	first;	it generally	presupposes	preliminary	medical	treatment	of	the	expectant mother;	and	it	provides	a	new	human	being	to	be	a	patient	to	some member	of	the	profession,	humanly	certain	to	have	its	share	of infantile	diseases,	and	likely,	if	it	survives	them,	to	produce children	of	its	own	before	the	final	death-bed	attendance	is reached.”	[70]</p>
<p class="calibre1">That	scandalous	suggestion	has	recently	been	repeated	by	the	President	of	the Society	for	Constructive	Birth	Control	and	Racial	Progress	under	the	following circumstances.	On	October	31,	1921,	the	 <i class="calibre4">Sussex	Daily	News</i>	published	the following	paragraph	from	its	London	correspondent. </p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Reverberations	of	Lord	Dawson’s	recent	sensational	address	to	the Church	Congress	on	birth	control	are	still	being	felt	as	well	in medical	as	in	clerical	circles.	Indeed,	the	subject	has	been	discussed by	the	lawyers	at	Gray’s	Inn.	The	London	Association	of	the	Medical Women’s	Federation	had	so	animated	a	discussion	on	it	that	it	was decided	to	continue	it	at	the	next	meeting.	It	is	quite	evident	that Lord	Dawson	did	not	speak	for	a	united	medical	profession.	Indeed, quite	a	number	of	doctors	of	all	creeds	are	attacking	the	new	Birth Control	Society.	A	London	physician	has	a	pamphlet	on	the	subject	in the	Press,	and	the	controversy	rages	fiercely	in	the	neighbourhood	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘birth-control’	clinics.	Much	is	likely	to	be	made	of	the	example	of France,	where	the	revolt	against	the	practices	advocated	is	now	in	full swing,	and	strong	legal	measures	have	been	taken	and	are	in contemplation.	French	medical	opinion	is	said	to	be	very	pronounced	on the	subject,	and	it	has,	of	course,	a	great	deal	of	clinical	experience to	back	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	November	8,	a	second	paragraph	appeared:</p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“My	remark	recently	that	‘a	number	of	doctors	of	all	creeds	are attacking	the	new	Birth-Control	Society’	has	been	challenged	by	the hon.	secretary	of	the	body	in	question,	who	observes	that	I	am misinformed.	I	must	adhere	to	my	statement,	which	was	a	record	of personal	observation.	Many	doctors	have	spoken	to	me	on	the	subject, and	their	opinions	on	the	ethics	of	birth	control	differ	widely;	but	I can	only	remember	one	who	did	not	attack	this	particular	society.	The secretary	suggests	that	I	am	confusing	what	his	society	advocates	with something	else.	As	a	matter	of	fact,	the	whole	question	of	birth control	has	been	discussed	more	than	once	by	medical	bodies.	A	doctor who	attended	one	such	discussion	shortly	after	the	opening	of	the clinic	in	Holloway	told	me	that,	while	there	was	division	of	opinion	on the	general	subject,	the	feeling	of	the	meeting	was	overwhelming against	the	particular	teaching	given	at	the	clinic,	as	undesirable	and actively	mischievous.	The	subject	is	controversial,	and	I	profess	to	do no	more	than	record	such	opinions	as	are	current.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“CONSTRUCTIVE	BIRTH	CONTROL</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,—Your	recent	paragraph	of	‘opinions’	about	the	Mothers’	Clinic and	the	Society	for	Constructive	Birth	Control	and	Racial	Progress	is not	only	extremely	unrepresentative,	but	grossly	misleading.	Your writer	says	that	he	can	only	remember	one	doctor	who	did	not	attack this	particular	society.	This	implies	that	the	medical	profession	is against	it,	which	is	absolutely	untrue,	as	is	quite	evident	from	the fact	that	we	have	three	of	the	most	distinguished	medical	men	in	Great Britain	on	our	list	of	Vice-Presidents;	four	others,	also	very distinguished,	on	our	Research	Committee;	and	that	Dr.	E.B.	Turner,	in a	Press	interview	after	the	recent	Church	Congress,	singled	out Constructive	Birth	Control	as	the	only	‘Control’	which	was	not mischievous. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“_That	there	may	be	medical	men	who	do	not	approve	of	birth	control	is natural,	when	one	remembers	that	a	doctor	has	to	make	his	living,	and can	do	so	more	easily	when	women	are	ailing	with	incessant	pregnancies than	when	they	maintain	themselves	in	good	health	by	only	having children	when	fitted	to	do	so.	Opinions	of	medicals,	therefore,	must	be sifted.	The	best	doctors	are	with	us;	the	self-seeking	and	the	biassed may	be	against	us_. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“MARIE	C.	STOPES, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“President	Society	for	Constructive	and	Racial	Progress.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	italics	are	mine,	and	they	draw	attention	to	a	disgraceful	statement concerning	the	medical	profession.	As	the	reader	is	aware,	certain	members	of our	profession	approve	of	artificial	birth	control.	What,	I	ask,	would	be	the opinion	of	the	general	public,	and	of	my	friends,	if	I	were	so	distraught	as	to suggest	that	these	men	approved	of	birth	control	because	they	had	a	financial interest	in	the	sale	of	contraceptives?	That	suggestion	would	be	as	reckless	and as	wicked	as	the	statement	made	by	Dr.	Marie	C.	Stopes.	In	the	 <i class="calibre4">British	Medical</i> <i class="calibre4">Journal</i>	of	November	26	I	quoted,	without	comment,	the	above	italicised paragraph	as	her	opinion	of	the	medical	profession,	and	on	December	10	the following	reply	from	the	lady	appeared:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	two	correspondents,	Dr.	Halliday	Sutherland	and	Dr.	Binnie Dunlop,	by	quoting	paragraphs	without	their	full	context,	appear	to lend	support	to	views	which	by	implication	are,	to	some	extent, detrimental	to	my	own.	This	method	of	controversy	has	never	appealed	to me,	but	in	the	interests	of	the	society	with	which	I	am	associated,	I must	be	allowed	to	answer	the	implications.	The	paragraph	quoted	by	Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sutherland	is	not,	as	would	appear	from	his	letter,	a	simple	opinion	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a>mine	on	the	medical	profession,	but	was	written	in	reply	to	a	rather scurrilous	paragraph	so	worded	as	to	lead	the	public	to	believe	that the	medical	profession	as	a	whole	was	against	the	Society	for Constructive	Birth	Control	and	Racial	Progress.	My	answer,	which appeared	not	only	in	the	papers	quoted	but	in	others,	contained	the following	statement:	‘We	have	three	of	the	most	distinguished	medical men	in	Great	Britain	on	our	list	of	Vice-Presidents;	four	others,	also very	distinguished,	on	our	Research	Committee.’	Reading	these	words before	the	paragraph	your	correspondent	quotes,	and	taking	all	in conjunction	with	an	attack	implying	that	the	entire	medical	profession was	against	us,	it	is	obvious	that	the	position	is	rather	different from	what	readers	of	Dr.	Sutherland’s	letter	in	your	issue	of	November 26	might	suppose.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	will	be	noted	that	Dr.	Stopes	does	not	withdraw	but	attempts	to	justify	her scandalous	suggestion	by	stating,	firstly,	that	the	full	context	of	her	letter	was	not quoted	by	me,	and	secondly,	that	her	original	letter	was	written	“in	reply	to	a rather	scurrilous	paragraph.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	have	now	quoted	in	full	her	original	letter,	excepting	the	address	of	her society,	and	the	two	paragraphs	from	the	 <i class="calibre4">Sussex	Daily	News</i>,	my	readers	may form	their	own	judgment	on	the	following	points:	Is	it	possible	to	maintain	that the	whole	context	of	her	original	letter	puts	a	different	complexion	on	her remarks	concerning	the	medical	profession?	Can	either	of	the	paragraphs	from the	 <i class="calibre4">Sussex	Daily	News</i>	be	truthfully	described	as	“rather	scurrilous,”	or	are	they fair	comment	on	a	matter	of	public	interest?	Moreover,	even	if	a	daily	paper	 <i class="calibre4">had</i> published	a	misleading	paragraph	about	this	society,	surely	that	is	not	a	valid reason	why	its	President	should	make	a	malignant	attack,	not	on	journalists,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a>on	the	medical	profession? </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	3.	A	CAUSE	OF	UNHAPPINESS	IN	MARRIAGE</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nor	does	birth	control	lead	to	happiness	in	marriage.	On	the	contrary,	experience shows	that	the	practice	is	injurious	not	only	to	the	bodies	but	also	to	the	minds	of men	and	women.	As	no	method	of	contraception	is	infallible,	the	wife	who allows	or	adopts	it	may	find	herself	in	the	truly	horrible	position	of	being secretly	or	openly	suspected	of	infidelity.	Again,	when	a	family	has	been	limited to	one	or	two	children	and	these	die,	the	parents	may	find	themselves	solitary and	childless	in	old	age;	and	mothers	thus	bereaved	are	often	the	victims	of profound	and	lasting	melancholy.	The	mother	of	a	large	family	has	her	worries, many	of	them	not	due	to	her	children,	but	to	the	social	evils	of	our	time:	and	yet she	is	less	to	be	pitied	than	the	woman	who	is	losing	her	beauty	after	a	fevered life	of,	vanity	and	self-indulgence,	and	who	has	no	one	to	love	her,	not	even	a child. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover,	these	practices	have	an	influence	on	the	relation	between	husband	and wife,	on	their	emotions	towards	each	other	and	towards	the	whole	sexual	nisus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Bernard	Shaw	recently	stated	[71]	that	when	people	adopt	methods	of	birth control	they	are	engaging,	not	in	sexual	intercourse,	but	in	reciprocal masturbation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	is	the	plain	truth	of	the	matter.	Or,	from	another	point	of	view,	it	may	be said	that	the	man	who	adopts	these	practices	is	simply	using	his	wife	as	he would	use	a	prostitute,	as	indeed	was	said	long	ago	by	St.	Thomas	Aquinas.	[72]</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	excuse	offered	for	illicit	sexual	intercourse	is	not	usually	pleasure,	but	that the	sex	impulse	is	irresistible:	and	the	same	argument	is	used	for	conjugal	union with	prevention.	In	both	cases	the	natural	result	of	union	is	not	desired,	and positive	means	are	taken	to	prevent	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	what	of	the	results	on	the	mutual	love,	if	an	old-fashioned	word	be	not	now out	of	place,	and	on	the	self-respect	of	two	people	so	associated?	Birth	control cannot	make	for	happiness,	because	it	means	that	mutual	love	is	at	the	mercy	of an	animal	instinct,	neither	satisfied	nor	denied.	It	is	an	old	truth	that	those	who seek	happiness	for	itself	never	find	it.	And	yet	the	advocates	of	birth	control have	the	temerity	to	claim	that	these	practices	lead	to	happiness.	I	presume	that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>of	the	bliss	following	marriage	with	contraceptives	the	crowded	lists	of	our divorce	courts	are	an	index.	The	marriage	bond	is	weakened	when	a	common lasting	interest	in	the	care	of	children	is	replaced	by	transient	sexual	excitement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	pregnancy	is	abolished	there	is	no	natural	check	on	the	sexual	passions	of husband	or	wife,	for	they	have	learnt	how	sexual	desire	may	be	gratified	without the	pain,	publicity,	and	responsibility	of	having	children.	In	the	experience	of	the world	marriages	based	merely	on	passion	are	seldom	happy,	and	artificial	birth control	means	passion	uncontrolled	by	nature.	These	methods	are	not	practised by	nations	such	as	Ireland	and	Spain,	who	accept	the	moral	rule	of	the	natural law	expressed	in	God’s	commandments	and	sanctioned	by	His	judgments;	and no	man	who	has	ever	lived	in	these	countries	could	truthfully	maintain	that	the people	there,	on	whom	the	burdens	of	marriage	press	as	elsewhere,	are	in	reality anxious	to	obtain	facilities	for	divorce.	On	the	other	hand,	there	are	many	who allege	that	the	people	of	England	are	shouting	out	for	greater	facilities	for divorce	than	they	now	possess.	At	any	rate,	it	is	obvious	enough	that	there	are those	amongst	us	who	are	straining	every	nerve	to	force	such	facilities	upon them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	4.	AN	INSULT	TO	TRUE	WOMANHOOD</p>
<p class="calibre1">It	has	been	said	that	patriotism	is	the	last	refuge	of	a	scoundrel;	and	apparently chivalry	is	the	last	refuge	of	a	fool.	Some	of	the	advocates	of	birth	control	who have	never	thought	the	matter	out,	either	passionately	or	dispassionately,	claim to	speak	on	behalf	of	women.	They	protest	that	“many	women	of	the	educated classes	revolt	against	the	drudgery,	anxieties,	inconveniences,	disease,	and disfigurements	which	attend	the	yearly	child-bearing	advocated	by	the	moralist.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">[73]</p>
<p class="calibre1">What	moralist?	Who	ever	said	it?	Again,	they	plead	for	women	who	“revolt” </p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	“disfigurement”	of	the	gestation	period.	The	great	artist	Botticelli	did not	think	this	was	disfigurement.	What	true	women	do?	Are	they	not	those	of whom	Kipling	writes,	“as	pale	and	as	stale	as	a	bone”?	And,	if	so,	are	these unworthy	specimens	of	their	sex	worth	tears?	The	vast	majority	of	women	bear the	discomforts	of	gestation	and	the	actual	perils	and	pangs	of	birth	with exemplary	fortitude:	and	it	is	a	gross	slander	for	anyone	to	maintain	that	a	few cowardly	and	degenerate	individuals	really	represent	that	devoted	sex.	But	these writers	are	indeed	well	out	of	the	ruck	of	ordinary	humanity,	because	they	tell	us</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a>that	“whatever	the	means	employed,	and	whether	righteous	or	not,	the propensity	to	limit	the	highest	form	of	life	operates	silently	and	steadily	amongst the	more	thoughtful	members	of	all	civilized	countries,”	and	yet	add	that	“it	is not	perhaps	good	taste	to	consider	the	means	employed	to	this	end.”	While	they thus	approve	and	commend	the	practice	of	birth	control	as	natural	to	“the	more thoughtful	members,”	they	nevertheless	question	the	“good	taste”	of	discussing the	very	methods	of	which	they	approve,	even	in	the	columns	of	a	medical journal!	Again,	they	tell	us	that	“assuredly	continence	is	not,	and	never	will	be, the	principal”	method.	That	may	be	possibly	true,	so	long	as	Christianity	is	more professed	than	practised;	God	knows	we	are	all	lacking	enough	in	self-control. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	yet	throughout	the	ages	moralists	have	preached	the	advantages	of	self-control,	and	we	ordinary	men	and	women	know	that	we	could	do	better,	and	that others	who	have	gone	before	us	have	done	better;	but	it	is	the	self-styled</p>
<p class="calibre1">“thoughtful	members”	who	proclaim	to	the	world	that	self-control	in	matters	of sex	is	an	impossibility,	and	therefore	not	to	be	even	attempted.	They	are	no common	people—these	epicureans,	selfish	even	in	their	refinement.	In	addition to	losing	their	morals,	they	have	certainly	lost	their	wits. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	5.	A	DEGRADATION	OF	THE	FEMALE	SEX</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	Neo-Malthusian	propaganda	there	is	yet	another	fact	which—should	be seized	by	every	married	woman,	because	it	is	a	clear	indication	of	a	tendency	to reduce	women	to	degrading	subjection.	No	recommendations	of	limited intercourse	or	of	self-restraint	according	to	the	dictates	of	reason	or	of	affection are	to	be	found	in	the	writings	of	birth	controllers.	Unrestrained	indulgence, without	the	risk	of	consequences,	is	their	motto.	To	this	end	they	advocate certain	contraceptive	methods,	and	the	reader	should	note	that	these	methods require	precautions	to	be	taken	solely	by	the	woman.	If	she	fails	to	take	these precautions,	or	if	the	precautions	themselves	fail,	all	responsibility	for	the occurrence	of	conception	rests	on	her	alone;	because	her	Malthusian	masters have	decided	that	she	alone	is	to	be,	made	responsible	for	preventing	the	natural or	possible	consequences	of	intercourse.	Why?	That	is	a	very	interesting question,	and	one	to	which	a	leading	Neo-Malthusian	has	given	the	answer. </p>

In	the Preface	to	the	first	edition,	[74]	the	anonymous	author	states:	“Had	it	not	been the	fear	of	causing	pain	to	a	relation,	I	should	have	felt	it	my	duty	to	put	my name	to	this	work;	in	order	that	any	censure	passed	upon	it	should	fall	upon myself	alone.”	The	relation	appears	to	have	had	a	long	life,	because	anonymity was	preserved	for	fifty	years,	presumably	out	of	respect	for	his,	or	her,	feelings: and	he,	or	she,	must	have	lived	as	long	as	the	author,	who	died	in	1904	at	the	age of	seventy-eight;	because	the	author’s	name	was	not	revealed	until	a	posthumous edition,	the	thirty-fifth,	appeared	in	1905,	from	which	we	learn	that	the	book	was written	by	the	late	Dr.	George	Drysdale,	brother	of	the	first	President	of	the Malthusian	League,	and	uncle	of	the	present	incumbent.	The	last	edition,	in recompense	for	its	smudgy	type,	contains	a	most	welcome	announcement	by	the publisher:</p>

<p class="calibre1">“PUBLISHER’S	NOTE.—…	It	is	due	alike	to	the	reader	and	the	publisher to	explain	why	the	present	edition	is	printed	(in	the	main)	from stereotypes	that	have	seen	fifty	years’	service.

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“The	first	of	these	modes	[_coitus	interruptus_]	is	physically injurious,	and	is	apt	to	produce	nervous	disorder	and	sexual</p>

The second,	namely	the	sheath,  <i class="calibre4">dulls	the	enjoyment</i>,	and	frequently produces	impotence	in	the	man	and	disgust	in	both	parties;	so	that	it also	is	injurious”	(p.	349)….	“Any	preventive	means,	to	be satisfactory,	must	be	used	by	the	woman,	as	_it	spoils	the	passion	and the	impulsiveness_	of	the	venereal	act	_if	the	man	have	to	think	of them_”	(p.	350). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	italics	are	mine,	but	the	following	comments	are	by	a	woman,	who	was moreover	the	first	woman	to	qualify	in	medicine—the	late	Dr.	Elizabeth Blackwell. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Here,	in	this	chief	teacher	of	the	Neo-Malthusians,	the	cloven	foot	is fully	revealed.	This	popular	author,	who	in	many	parts	of	his	book denounces	marriage	as	the	enslavement	of	men	and	women,	who	sneers	at continence,	and	rages	at	Christianity	as	a	vanishing	superstition—all under	a	special	pretence	of	benevolence	and	desire	for	the	advancement of	the	human	race,	here	clearly,	shows	what	he	is	aiming	at,	and	what his	doctrines	lead	to.	Male	sexual	pleasure	must	not	be	interfered with,	male	lust	may	be	indulged	in	to	any	extent	that	pleasure	demands, but	woman	must	take	the	entire	responsibility,	that	male	indulgence	be not	disturbed	by	any	inconvenient	claims	from	paternity.

<p class="calibre1">“Morally,	the	doctrine	is	indefensible—it	follows	the	line	of	least resistance,	and	sacrifices	the	spirit	to	the	flesh.	Materially,	it	is fraught	with	grave	danger	to	the	home	and	to	our	national	existence.

Now	it is	in	these	homes	that	the	moral	sense	has	already	but	little	chance	of development,	where	the	child	of	eight	or	ten	already	knows	far	more than	is	good	for	the	health	of	either	body	or	mind,	and,	though	we	may succeed	in	reducing	the	size	of	the	family,	yet	the	means	we	employ</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a>will	militate	against	the	raising	of	the	moral	tone	of	the	household, and	the	children	will	not	be	any	less	precocious	than	before.”	[76]</p>
<p class="calibre1">That	danger	is	ignored	by	the	advocates	of	birth-control.	“But	he	that	shall scandalise	one	of	these	little	ones	that	believe	in	Me,	it	were	better	for,	him	that	a mill-stone	were	hanged	about	his	neck,	and	that	he	were	drowned	in	the	depth, of	the	sea.”	[77]</p>
<p class="calibre1">(b)	 <i class="calibre4">Exposing	the	Poor	to	Experiment</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Secondly,	the	ordinary	decent	instincts	of	the	poor	are	against	these	practices, and	indeed	they	have	used	them	less	than	any	other	class.	But,	owing	to	their poverty,	lack	of	learning,	and	helplessness,	the	poor	are	the	natural	victims	of those	who	seek	to	make	experiments	on	their	fellows.	In	the	midst	of	a	London slum	a	woman,	who	is	a	doctor	of	German	philosophy	(Munich),	has	opened	a Birth	Control	Clinic,	where	working	women	are	instructed	in	a	method	of contraception	described	by	Professor	McIlroy	as	“the	most	harmful	method	of which	I	have	had	experience.”	[78]	When	we	remember	that	millions	are	being spent	by	the	Ministry	of	Health	and	by	Local	Authorities—on	pure	milk	for necessitous	expectant	and	nursing	mothers,	on	Maternity	Clinics	to	guard	the health	of	mothers	before	and	after	childbirth,	for	the	provision	of	skilled midwives,	and	on	Infant	Welfare	Centres—all	for	the	single	purpose	of	bringing healthy	children	into	our	midst,	it	is	truly	amazing	that	this	monstrous	campaign of	birth	control	should	be	tolerated	by	the	Home	Secretary.	Charles	Bradlaugh was	condemned	to	jail	for	a	less	serious	crime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(c)	 <i class="calibre4">Tending	towards	the	Servile	State</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Thirdly,	the	policy	of	birth	control	opens	the	way	to	an	extension	of	the	Servile State,	[79]	because	women	as	well	as	men	could	then	be	placed	under	conditions of	economic	slavery.	Hitherto,	the	rule	has	been	that	during	child-bearing	age	a woman	must	be	supported	by	her	husband,	and	the	general	feeling	of	the community	has	been	opposed	to	any	conditions	likely	to	force	married	women on	to	the	industrial	market.	In	her	own	home	a	woman	works	hard,	but	she	is working	for	the	benefit	of	 <i class="calibre4">her</i>	family	and	not	directly	for	the	benefit	of	a stranger.	If,	instead	of	bearing	children,	women	practise	birth	control,	and	if children	are	to	be	denied	to	the	poor	as	a	privilege	of	the	rich,	then	it	would	be very	easy	to	exploit	the	women	of	the	poorer	classes.	If	women	have	no	young</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>children	why	should	they	be	exempt	from	the	economic	pressure	that	is	applied to	men?	And	indeed,	where	birth	control	is	practised	women	tend	more	and	more to	supplant	men,	especially	in	ill-paid	grades	of	work.	One	of	the	birth controllers	has	suggested	that	young	couples,	who	otherwise	could	not	afford	to marry,	should	marry	but	have	no	children,	and	thus	continue	to	work	at	their respective	employments	during	the	day.	As	the	girl	would	have	little	time	for cooking	and	other	domestic	duties,	this	immoralist	is	practically	subverting	the very	idea	of	a	home!	The	English	poor	have	already	lost	even	the	meaning	of	the word	“property,”	and	if	the	birth	controllers	had	their	way	the	meaning	of	the word	“home”	would	soon	follow.	The	aim	of	birth	control	is	generally	masked by	falsehood,	but	the	urging	of	this	policy	on	the	poor	points	unmistakably	to	the Servile	State.	When	a	nation,	or	a	section	of	a	nation,	is	oppressed,	their	birthrate rises.	That	is	the	immutable	law	of	nature	as	witnessed	in	history.	Thus,	the Israelites	increased	under	the	oppression	of	the	Pharaohs.	Thus,	the	Irish,	from the	Union	to	the	Famine,	multiplied	prodigiously	under	the	oppression	of	an iniquitous	political	and	land	system.	By	the	operation	of	this	law	the	oppressed grow	in	numbers,	and	break	their	chains. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Section	7.	A	MENACE	TO	THE	NATION</p>
<p class="calibre1">(a)	 <i class="calibre4">There	is	a	Limit	to	lowering	the	Death-rate</i> Birth	controllers	believe	that	a	high	birthrate	is	the	cause	of	a	high	death-rate, and	that	overpopulation	is	the	cause	of	poverty.	Yet,	in	spite	of	their	beliefs,	they make	the	following	statement:	“Neo-Malthusians	have	not	aimed	at	reducing population,	but	only	at	reducing	unnecessary	death,	which	injures	the community	without	adding	to	its	numbers.”	[80]	In	defence	of	this	statement they	argue	that	if	the	death-rate	falls	people	will	live	longer,	and	therefore	the population	will	not	decrease,	although	the	birthrate	is	lowered.	There	are	two fallacies	in	their	argument.	They	overlook	the	fact	that	every	one	of	us	must	die, and	that	therefore	there	is	a	limit	beyond	which	a	death-rate	cannot	possibly	fall, whereas	there	is	no	limit,	except	zero,	to	the	possible	fall	in	a	birthrate.	If	a birthrate	fell	to	nothing	and	no	children	were	born,	it	is	obvious	that	the population	would	eventually	vanish.	The	second	fallacy	is	that	a	low	birthrate will	permanently	lower	the	death-rate.	At	first	a	falling	birthrate	increases	the proportion	of	young	adults	in	the	population,	and,	as	the	death-rate	during	early adult	life	is	relatively	low,	the	total	death-rate	tends	to	fall	for	a	time.	Sooner	or</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>later	there	is	an	increase	in	the	proportion	of	old	people	in	the	population,	and,	as the	death-rate	during	old	age	is	high,	the	total	death-rate	tends	to	rise.	That	is now	happening	in	England,	and	these	are	the	 <i class="calibre4">actual	facts</i>	as	recorded	by	the Registrar-General:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“It	may	be	pointed	out	that,	though	the	effect	of	the	fall	in	the birthrate	has	hitherto	been	an	a	sense	advantageous	in	that	it	has increased	the	proportions	living	at	the	working	ages,	a	tendency	to	the reversal	of	this	fact	has	already	set	in,	and	may	be	expected	to develop	as	time	goes	on…. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“The	general	characteristics	of	the	figures	indicate	very	clearly	the effects	of	the	long-continued	decline	in	the	birthrate	of	this country,	and	show,	by	the	example	of	France,	the	type	of age-distribution	which	a	further	continuance	of	the	decline	is	likely to	produce.	The	present	age-distribution	of	the	English	population	is still	favourable	to	low	death-rates,	but	is	becoming	less	so	than	it was	in	1901.	The	movements	along	the	curve	of	the	point	of	maximum heaping	up	population,	referred	to	on	page	61	(See	[Reference: Population]),	has	shifted	this	from	age	20-25	to	a	period	ten	years later,	when	mortality	is	appreciably	higher.”—Census	of	England	and Wales,	1911.	General	Report,	with	Appendices,	pp.	62	and	65. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a>Of	these	facts	the	birth	controllers,	would	appear	to	be	ignorant.	That	is	a charitable	assumption;	but,	in	view	of	the	vital	importance	of	this	question	their ignorance	is	culpable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(b)	 <i class="calibre4">Birth	Control	tends	to	extinguish	the	Birthrate</i> Whatever	may	be	the	nebulous	aim	of	birth	controllers,	the	actual	results	of	birth control	are	quite	definite.	We	have	no	accurate	information	regarding	the	extent to	which,	birth	control	is	practised,	for,	needless	to	say,	the	Malthusians	can provide	us	with	no	exact	figures	bearing	on	this	question;	but	we	do	know	that birth	control,	when	adopted,	is	mostly	practised	amongst	the	better	paid	artisans and	wealthier	classes.	After	full	examination	of	the	evidence;	the	National Birthrate	Commission	were	unanimously	agreed	“That	the	greater	incidence	of infant	mortality	upon	the	less	prosperous	classes	does	not	reduce	their	effective fertility	to	the	level	of	that	of	the	wealthier	classes.”	[81]	It	is	probable	that	this Commission	overestimated	the	extent	to	which	birth	control	has	contributed	to the	declining	birthrate;	but,	even	so,	this	does	not	alter	the	obvious	fact	that artificial	birth	control,	when	adopted,	reduces	fertility	to	a	lower	level	than Nature	intended.	If	language	has	any	meaning,	birth	control	means	a	falling birthrate,	and	a	falling	birthrate	means	depopulation.	Here	and	there	this	evil practice	may	increase	the	material	prosperity	of	an	individual,	but	it	lowers	the prosperity	of	the	nation	by	reducing	the	number	of	citizens.	Moreover,	as	birth control	is	not	a	prevailing	vice	amongst	semi-civilised	peoples,	the	adoption	of this	practice	by	civilised	nations	means	that	the	proportion	of	civilised	to uncivilised	inhabitants	of	the	world	will	be	reduced.	If	birth	control	had	been extensively	practised	in	the	past	the	colonisation	of	the	British	Empire	would have	been	a	physical	impossibility;	and	to-day,	in	our	vast	overseas	dominions, are	great	empty	spaces	whose	untilled	soil	and	excellent	climate	await	a population.	Is	that	population	to	be	white,	or	yellow?	A	question	which	to-day fills	the	Australian	with	apprehension. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Many	people	are	honestly	perplexed	by	Neo-Malthusian	propaganda,	and	are honestly	ignorant	of	the	truth	concerning	the	population	and	the	food	supply	of the	British	Empire.

They apply	to	that	propaganda	the	ordinary	test	of	the	world,	namely,	‘Will	it	work?’</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a>rather	than	that	other	test	which	asks,	‘Is	it	right?’	The	question	I	would	put	to people	who	reason	in	that	way,	and	they	are	many,	is	a	very	simple	one.	If	it	can be	proved	that	Neo-Malthusian	propaganda	is	based	on	an	absolute	falsehood, will	it	not	follow	that	the	chief	argument	in	favour	of	artificial	birth	control	has been	destroyed?	Let	us	put	this	matter	to	the	proof.	Neo-Malthusians	state	that the	population	of	the	Empire	is	increasing	more	rapidly	than	the	food	supply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	is	a	definite	statement.	It	is	either	true	or	false.

They	are	unmoved	by	the	story	of sacrifice,	of	thrift,	and	of	patient	trust	in	God	that	is	told	for	instance	in	the history	of	the	Protestant	manses	of	Scotland,	where	ministers	on	slender	stipends brought	up	families	of	ten	and	twelve,	where	the	boys	won	scholarships	at	the universities,	and	where	women	were	the	mothers	of	men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These	days	have	been	recalled	by	Norman	Macleod:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“The	minister,	like	most	of	his	brethren,	soon	took	to	himself	a	wife, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>the	daughter	of	a	neighbouring	‘gentleman	tacksman,’	and	the grand-daughter	of	a	minister,	well	born	and	well	bred;	and	never	did man	find	a	help	more	meet	for	him.	In	that	manse	they	lived	for	nearly fifty	years,	and	there	were	born	to	them	sixteen	children;	yet	neither father	nor	mother	could	ever	lay	hand	on	a	child	and	say,	‘We	wish	this one	had	not	been.’	They	were	all	a	source	of	unmingled	joy….”	[90]</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“A	‘wise’	neighbour	once	remarked,	‘That	minister	with	his	large	family will	ruin	himself,	and	if	he	dies	they	will	be	beggars.’	Yet	there	has never	been	a	beggar	among	then	to	the	fourth	generation.”	[91]</p>
<p class="calibre1">How	did	they	manage	to	provide	for	their	children?	In	this	pagan,	spoon-fed	age, many	people	will	laugh	when	they	read	the	answer—in	a	family	letter,	written more	than	a	hundred	years	ago	by	a	man	who	was	poor:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“But	the	thought—I	cannot	provide	for	these!	Take	care,	minister,	the anxiety	of	your	affection	does	not	unhinge	that	confidence	with	which the	Christian	ought	to	repose	upon	the	wise	and	good	providence	of God!	What	though	you	are	to	leave	your	children	poor	and	friendless? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Is	the	arm	of	the	Lord	shortened,	that	He	cannot	help?	Is	His	ear heavy,	that	He	cannot	hear?	You	yourself	have	been	no	more	than	an instrument	in	the	hand	of	His	goodness;	and	is	His	goodness,	pray, bound	up	in	your	feeble	arm?	Do	you	what	you	can;	leave	the	rest	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a>God.	Let	them	be	good,	and	fear	the	Lord,	and	keep	His	commandments, and	He	will	provide	for	them	in	His	own	way	and	in	His	own	time.	Why, then,	wilt	thou	be	cast	down,	O	my	soul;	why	disquieted	within	me? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trust	thou	in	the	Lord!	Under	all	the	changes	and	the	cares	and	the troubles	of	this	life,	may	the	consolations	of	religion	support	our spirits.	In	the	multitude	of	thoughts	within	me,	Thy	comforts	O	my God,	delight	my	soul!	But	no	more	of	this	preaching-like	harangue,	of which,	I	doubt	not,	you	wish	to	be	relieved.	Let	me	rather	reply	to your	letter,	and	tell	you	my	news.”	[92]</p>
<p class="calibre1">That	letter	was	written	by	Norman	Macleod,	ordained	in	1774,	and	minister	of the	Church	of	Scotland	in	Morven	for	some	forty	years.	His	stipend	was	�40, afterwards	raised	to	�80.	He	had	a	family	of	sixteen.	One	of	his	sons	was minister	in	Campbelltown,	and	later	in	Glasgow.	He	had	a	family	of	eleven.	His eldest	son	was	Chaplain	to	Queen	Victoria,	and	wrote	the	 <i class="calibre4">Reminiscences	of	a</i> <i class="calibre4">Highland	Parish</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	birth	controllers	ask	why	we	should	bring	up	children	at	great	cost	and trouble	to	ourselves,	and	they	have	been	well	answered	by	a	non-Catholic	writer, Dr.	W.E.	Home.	[93]</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“One	of	my	acquaintances	refuses	to	have	a	second	child	because	he could	not	then	play	golf.	Is	there,	then,	no	pleasure	in	children	which shall	compensate	for	the	troubles	and	expenses	they	bring	upon	you?	I notice	that	the	penurious	Roman	Catholic	French	Canadian	farmers	are spreading	out	of	Quebec	and	occupying	more	and	more	of	Ontario.	I	fancy</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a>these	hard-living	parents	would	think	their	struggles	to	bring	up	their large	(ten	to	twenty)	families	worth	while	when	they	see	how	their group	is	strengthening	its	position.	If	a	race	comes	to	find	no instinctive	pleasure	in	children	it	will	probably	be	swept	away	by others	more	virile.	One	man	will	live	where	another	will	starve; prudence	and	selfishness	are	not	identical. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“In	her	book,  <i class="calibre4">The	Strength	of	a	People</i>,	Mrs.	Bosanquet,	who	signed the	Majority	Report	of	the	Poor	Law	Commission,	tells	the	story	of	two girls	in	domestic	service	who	became	engaged.	One	was	imprudent, married	at	once,	lived	in	lodgings,	trusted	to	the	Church	and	the parish	doctor	to	see	her	through	her	first	confinement,	had	no foresight	or	management,	every	succeeding	child	only	added	to	her worries,	and	her	marriage	was	a	failure.	The	other	was	prudent,	did	not marry	till,	after	six	months,	she	and	her	fianc�	had	chosen	a	house	and its	furniture.	Then	she	married,	and	their	house	was	their	own	careful choice;	every	table	and	chair	reminded	them	of	the	afternoon	they	had had	together	when	it	was	chosen;	they	were	amusement	enough	to themselves,	and	they	saved	their	money	for	the	expenses	of	her confinement.	He	had	not	to	seek	amusement	outside	his	home,	did	his work	with	a	high	sanction	and	got	promoted,	and	each	child	was	only	an</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a>added	pleasure.	Idyllic;	yes,	but	sometimes	true.	One	of	the	happiest men	I	have	known	was	a	Marine	sergeant	with	ten	children,	and	a	bed	in his	house	for	stray	boys	he	thought	he	should	help. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“One	of	my	friends	married	young	and	had	five	children;	this	required management.	He	certainly	could	not	go	trips,	take	courses	and	extra qualifications,	but	he	did	his	work	all	right,	and	his	sons	were	there to	help	in	the	war,	and	one	of	them	has	won	a	position	of	Imperial usefulness	far	above	that	of	his	father	or	me.	Is	that	no	compensation to	his	parents	for	old-time	difficulties	they	have	by	now	almost forgotten?	A	bad	tree	cannot	bring	forth	good	fruit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	W.E.	Home	is	right,	and	the	Neo-Malthusian	golfer	is	wrong.	Moreover,	he	is wrong	as	a	golfer.	Golf	requires	skill,	a	fine	co-ordination	of	sight	and	touch, much	patience	and	self-control:	and	many	unfortunate	people	lack	these	qualities of	mind	and	body,	and	are	therefore	unable	to	play	this	game	with	pleasure	to themselves	or	to	others.	Consequently	every	golfer,	no	matter	whether	he	accepts the	hypothesis	of	Spencer	or	that	of	Weismann	concerning	the	inheritance	of acquired	characteristics,	should	rejoice	to	see	his	large	family	in	the	links	as	a good	omen	for	the	future	of	this	game,	although	there	be	some	other	reasons	that also	justify	the	existence	of	children. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">(d)	The	Dangers	of	Small	Families</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In	a	Malthusian	leaflet,	written	for	the	poor	Dr.	Binnie	Dunlop	states:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“You	must	at	least	admit	that	there	would	be	nothing	like	the	usual poverty	if	married	couples	had	only	one	child	for	every	20s.	or	so,	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>week	of	wages.	Yet	the	population	would	continue	to	increase	rapidly, because	very	few	of	the	children	of	small	families	die	or	grow	up weakly;	and	it	would	become	stronger,	richer,	and	of	course	much happier.”	[94]</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	false	suggestion	contained	in	his	first	sentence,	namely	that	a	high	birthrate is	the	cause	of	poverty,	has	already	been	exposed	(Chap.	II),	and	apparently	Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Binnie	Dunlop	has	never	considered	 <i class="calibre4">why</i>	so	many	of	the	English	people	should be	so	poor	as	to	enable	him	to	make	use	of	their	very	poverty	in	order	to	tempt them	to	adopt	an	evil	method	of	birth	control.	Moreover,	his	second	contention, that	a	small	family	produces	a	higher	type	of	child,	better	fed,	better	trained,	and healthier,	than	is	found	amongst	the	children	of	large	families	is	contrary	to	the following	facts,	as	stated	by	Professor	Meyrick	Booth:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“1.	A	civilisation	cannot	be	maintained	with	an	average	of	less	than about	four	children	per	marriage;	a	smaller	number	will	lead	to	actual extinction. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“2.	Much	information	exists	tending	to	show	that	heredity	strongly favours	the	third,	fourth,	fifth,	and	subsequent	children	born	to	a given	couple,	rather	than	the	 <i class="calibre4">first	two</i>,	who	are	peculiarly	apt	to inherit	some	of	the	commonest	physical	and	mental	defects	(upon	this important	point	the	records	of	the	University	of	London	Eugenics Laboratory	should	be	consulted).	A	population	with	a	low	birthrate thus	naturally	tends	to	degenerate.	_It	is	the	normal,	and	not	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>small	family,	that	gives	the	best	children_. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“3.	The	present	differential	birthrate—high	amongst	the	less intelligent	classes	and	low	amongst	the	most	capable	families—so	far from	leading	upwards,	is	causing	the	race	to	breed	to	a	lower	type. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“4.	The	small	family	encourages	the	growth	of	luxury	and	the development	of	what	M.	Leroy-Beaulieu	calls	 <i class="calibre4">l’esprit	arriviste</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“5.	The	popular	idea	that	 <i class="calibre4">childbirth	is	injurious</i>	to	a	woman’s	health is	probably	 <i class="calibre4">quite	erroneous</i>.	Where	the	_birth-rate	is	high	the	health of	the	woman	is	apparently	better_	than	where	it	is	artificially	low. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“6.	A	study	of	history	does	not	show	that	nations	with	low	birthrates have	been	able	to	attain	to	a	higher	level	of	civilisation.	Such nations	have	been	thrust	into	the	background	by	their	hardier neighbours.”	[95]</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover,	M.	Leroy-Beaulieu,	in	 <i class="calibre4">La	Question	de	la	Population</i>	[96]	states	that those	districts	of	France	which	show	an	exceptionally	low	birthrate	are distinguished	by	a	peculiar	atmosphere	of	materialism,	and	that	their	inhabitants exhibit,	in	a	high	degree,	an	attitude	of	mind	well	named	 <i class="calibre4">l’esprit	arriviste</i>—the desire	to	concentrate	on	outward	success,	to	push	on,	to	be	climbers,	to	advance themselves	and	their	children	in	fashionable	society.	This	spirit	means	the willing	sacrifice	of	all	ideals	of	ethics	or	of	patriotism	to	family	egoism.	To	this</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>mental	attitude,	and	to	the	corresponding	absence	of	religion,	he	attributes	the decline	of	population.	In	conclusion	the	following	evidence	is	quoted	by Professor	Meyrick	Booth:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 <i class="calibre4">Revue	des	Deux	Mondes</i>	for	July	1911	contains	a	valuable	account, by	a	doctor	resident	in	Gascony,	of	the	state	of	things	in	that	part	of France	(where,	it	will	be	remembered,	the	birthrate	is	especially low).	He	expresses	with	the	utmost	emphasis	the	conviction	that	the Gascons	are	deteriorating,	physically	and	mentally,	and	points	out,	at the	same	time,	that	the	decline	of	population	has	had	an	injurious effect	upon	the	economic	condition	of	the	country.	‘L’hyponatalit�	est une	cause	pr�cise	et	directe	de	la	d�g�n�rescence	de	la	race,’	he writes.	And,	dealing	with	the	belief	that	a	low	birthrate	will	result in	the	development	of	a	superior	type	of	child,	he	says:	‘C’est	une illusion	qui	ne	r�siste	pas	�	la	lumi�re	des	faits	tels	que	les	montre l’�tude	d�mographique	de	nos	villages	gascons.	Depuis	que	beaucoup	de bancs	restent	vides	�	la	petite	�cole,	les	�coliers	ne	sont	ni	mieux dou�s,	ni	plus	travailleurs,	et	ils	sont	certainement	moins	vigoureux.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">And	again,	‘La	quantit�	est	en	g�n�ral	la	condition	premi�re	et souveraine	de	la	qualit�.’”	[97]</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	8.	THE	PLOT	AGAINST	CHRISTENDOM</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a>All	purposive	actions	are	ultimately	based	on	philosophy	of	one	sort	or	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If,	for	example,	we	find	a	rich	man	founding	hospitals	for	the	poor,	we	may assume	that	he	believes	in	the	principle	of	Charity.	It	is,	therefore,	of	prime importance	to	determine	what	kind	of	philosophy	underlies	Neo-Malthusian propaganda.	The	birth	controllers	profess	to	be	actuated	solely	by	feelings	of compassion	and	of	benevolence	towards	suffering	humanity;	and	it	is	on	these grounds	that	they	are	appealing	to	the	Church	of	England	to	bless	their	work,	or at	least	to	lend	to	their	propaganda	a	cloak	of	respectability.	Now,	the	very	fact that	Neo-Malthusians	are	sincere	in	their	mistaken	and	dangerous	convictions makes	it	all	the	more	necessary	that	we	should	discover	the	doctrines	on	which their	propaganda	was	originally	based;	because,	although	their	economic fallacies	were	borrowed	from	Malthus,	their	philosophy	came	from	a	different source. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	philosophy	is	to	be	found,	naked	and	unashamed,	in	a	book	entitled	 <i class="calibre4">The</i> <i class="calibre4">Elements	of	Social	Science</i>.	I	have	already	referred	to	this	work	as	the	Bible	of Neo-Malthusians,	and	its	teaching	has	been	endorsed	as	recently	as	1905	by	the official	journal	of	the	Malthusian	League,	as	witness	the	following	eulogy, whose	last	lines	recall	the	happy	days	of	Bret	Harte	in	the	Far	West,	and	the eloquent	periods	of	our	old	and	valued	friend	Colonel	Starbottle:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“This	work	should	be	read	by	all	followers	of	J.S.	Mill,	Garnier,	and the	Neo-Malthusian	school	of	economists.	We	could	give	a	long	criticism of	the	many	important	chapters	in	this	book;	but,	as	we	might	be considered	as	prejudiced	in	its	favour	because	of	our	agreement	with its	aims,	we	prefer	to	cite	the	opinion	given	by	the	editor	of	that widely	circulated	and	most	enlightened	paper	_The	Weekly	Times	and Echo_,	which	appears	in	its	issue	of	October	8.”	[98]</p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	quoting	from	the	book	an	explanation	is	due	to	my	readers.	I	do	not suggest	that	all	of	those	who	are	to-day	supporting	the	propaganda	for	artificial birth	control	would	agree	with	its	foolish	blasphemies	and	drivelling</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a>imbecilities;	but	it	is	nevertheless	necessary	to	quote	these	things,	because	our birth	controllers	are	too	wise	in	their	day	and	generation	to	reveal	to	the	public, still	less	to	the	Church	of	England,  <i class="calibre4">the	philosophy	on	which	Neo-Malthusianism</i> <i class="calibre4">was	originally	based,	and	from	which	it	has	grown</i>.	Moreover,	the	Malthusians claim	that	it	was	the	author	of	the	 <i class="calibre4">Elements	of	Social	Science</i>	“who	interested Mr.	Charles	Bradlaugh	and	Mrs.	Annie	Besant	in	the	question.”	[99]	Four quotations	from	the	last	edition	of	the	book	will	suffice:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“But	this	is	a	certain	truth,	that	any	human	being,	any	one	of	us, no	matter	how	fallen	and	degraded,	is	an	infinitely	more	glorious and	adorable	being	than	any	God	that	ever	was	or	will	be conceived”	(p.	413). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	justice	to	the	memory	of	John	Stuart	Mill,	whom	Malthusians	are	ever quoting,	it	should	be	noted	that	the	foregoing	blasphemy	is	nothing	more	nor	less than	a	burlesque	of	Positivism	or	of	Agnosticism.	The	teaching	of	Mill,	Bain, and	of	Herbert	Spencer	was	that	the	knowledge	of	God	and	of	His	nature	is impossible,	because	our	senses	are	the	 <i class="calibre4">only</i>	source	of	knowledge.	Their reasoning	was	wrong—because	a	primary	condition	of	all	knowledge	is	memory, in	itself	an	intuition,	because	primary	mathematical	axioms	are	intellectual intuitions,	and	because	mind	has	the	power	of	abstraction;	but,	even	so,	not	one of	these	men	was	capable	of	having	written	the	above-quoted	passage.	The	next quotation	refers	to	marriage. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Marriage	is	based	upon	the	idea	that	constant	and	unvarying	love	is the	only	one	which	is	pure	and	honourable,	and	which	should	be recognised	as	morally	good.	But	there	could	not	be	a	greater	error	than this.	Love	is,	like	all	other	human	passions	and	appetites,	subject	to change,	deriving	a	great	part	of	its	force	and	continuance	from	variety</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a>in	its	objects;	and	to	attempt	to	fix	it	to	an	invariable	channel	is	to try	to	alter	the	laws	of	its	nature”(p.	353). </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	quotation	is	an	example	of	how	evil	ideas	may	arise	from	muddled thinking:	because	if	the	word	“lust”	be	substituted	for	the	word	“love”	in	the third	sentence,	the	remaining	forty-five	words	would	merely	convey	a	simple truth,	expressed	by	Kipling	in	two	lines:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“For	the	more	you	‘ave	known	o’	the	others</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	less	will	you	settle	to	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Very	few	people,	I	suppose,	are	so	foolish	as	to	believe	that	man	is	by	nature either	a	chaste	or	a	constant	animal,	and	indeed	in	this	respect	he	appears	to	his disadvantage	when	compared	with	certain	varieties	of	birds,	which	are	 <i class="calibre4">by	nature</i> constant	to	each	other.	On	the	other	hand,	millions	of	people	believe	that	man	is able	to	overcome	his	animal	nature;	and	for	the	past	two	thousand	years	the civilised	races	of	the	world	have	held	that	this	is	a	goal	towards	which	mankind should	strive.	In	the	opinion	of	Christendom	chastity	and	marriage	are	both morally	good,	but,	according	to	the	philosophy	of	our	Neo-Malthusian	author, they	are	morally	evil. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Chastity,	or	complete	sexual	abstinence,	so	far	from	being	a	virtue, is	invariably	a	great	natural	sin”	(p.	162). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Is	it	not	obvious	that	to	the	writers	of	such	passages	love	is	synonymous	with animalism,	with	lust?	It	is	by	no	means	necessary	to	go	to	saints	or	to	moralists for	a	refutation	of	this	Neo-Malthusian	philosophy.	Does	any	decent	ordinary man	or	woman	agree	with	it?	Ask	the	man	in	the	street.	Turn	the	pages	of	our literature.	Refer	to	Chaucer	or	Spenser,	to	Shakespeare	or	Milton,	refer	to Fielding	or	Burns	or	Scott	or	Tennyson.	Some	of	these	men	were	very	imperfect; but	they	all	knew	the	difference	between	lust	and	love;	and	it	is	because	they	can tell	us	at	least	something	of	that	which	is	precious,	enduring,	ethereal,	and	divine in	love	that	we	read	their	pages	and	honour	their	names.	Not	one	of	these	men</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a>could	have	written	the	following	sentence:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Marriage	distracts	our	attention	from	the	real	sexual duties,	and	this	is	one	of	its	worst	effects”	(p.	366). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	it	is	certain	that	if	“the	real	sexual	duties”	are	represented	by	promiscuous fornication,	then	both	marriage	and	chastity	are	evil	things.	That	philosophy	is very	old.	From	time	immemorial—it	has	been	advocated	by	one	of	the	most powerful	intelligences	in	the	universe.	Such	is	the	soil	on	which	the	Neo-Malthusian	fungus	has	grown—a	soil	that	would	rot	the	foundations	of	Europe. </p>

<p class="calibre1">THE	RELIGIOUS	ARGUMENT	AGAINST	BIRTH	CONTROL</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	1.	AN	OFFENCE	AGAINST	THE	LAW	OF	NATURE</p>
<p class="calibre1">Birth	control	is	against	the	law	of	nature,	which	Christians	believe	to	be	the reflection	of	the	divine	law	in	human	affairs,	and	any	violation	of	this	law	was held	to	be	vicious	even	by	the	ancient	pagan	world.	To	this	argument	an advocate	of	birth	control	has	made	answer:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“We	interfere	with	nature	at	every	point—we	shave,	cut	our	hair,	cook our	food,	fill	cavities	in	our	teeth	(or	wear	artificial	teeth),	clothe ourselves,	wear	boots,	hats,	and	wash	our	faces,	so	why	should	birth alone	be	sacred	from	the	touch	and	play	of	human	moulding?”	[100]</p>
<p class="calibre1">Why?	For	a	very	simple	reason.	Birth	control	belongs	to	the	moral	sphere;	it essentially	affects	man’s	progress	in	good,	whereas	all	the	other	things	that	he mentions	have	no	more	moral	significance	than	has	the	practice	of	agriculture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Regarded	in	the	light	of	the	law	of	nature	they	are	neutral	actions,	neither	good nor	bad	in	themselves,	raising	no	question	of	right	or	wrong,	and	having	no	real bearing	on	the	accomplishment	of	human	destiny.	To	make	no	distinction between	the	merely	physical	law	of	nature	(expressed	in	the	invariable	tendency of	everything	to	act	according	to	its	kind)	and	the	natural	moral	law	which governs	human	conduct,	is	to	pronounce	oneself	a	materialist.	Yet	even	a materialist	ought	to	denounce	the	practice	of	birth	control,	as	it	violates	the	laws of	nature	which	regulate	physical	well-being.	“But,”	says	the	materialist,	“it	is not	possible	for	anyone	to	act	against	nature,	because	all	actions	take	place	 <i class="calibre4">in</i> nature,	and	therefore	every	act	is	a	natural	act.”	Quite	so:	in	that	sense	murder	is a	natural	act;	even	unnatural	vice	is	a	natural	act.	Will	any	one	defend	them? </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	is	a	natural	law	in	the	physical	world,	and	there	is	a	natural	law	in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a>conscience—a	law	of	right	conduct.	Certain	actions	are	under	the	control	of	the human	will,	which	is	able	to	rebel	against	the	moral	law	of	nature,	and	the	pagan poet	Aeschylus	traces	all	human	sorrow	to	“the	perverse	human	will omnipresent.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	birth	control	means	the	deliberate	frustration	of	a	natural	act	which	might have	issued	in	a	new	life,	it	is	an	unnatural	crime,	and	is	stigmatised	by theologians	as	a	sin	akin	to	murder.	To	this	charge	birth	controllers	further	reply that	millions	of	the	elements	of	procreation	are	destroyed	by	Nature	herself,	and that	“to	add	one	more	to	these	millions	sacrificed	by	Nature	is	surely	no	crime.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	attempt	at	argument	is	pathetic.	If	these	people	knew	even	the	A.B.C.	of biology,	they	would	know	that	millions	of	those	elements	are	allowed	to	perish by	Nature	for	a	definite	purpose—namely,  <i class="calibre4">to	make	procreation	more	certain</i>.	It is	in	order	that	the	one	may	achieve	the	desired	end	that	it	is	reinforced	by millions	of	others.	Moreover,	although	millions	of	deaths	in	the	world	occur every	year	from	natural	causes,	it	would	nevertheless,	I	fear,	be	a	crime	if	I	were to	cause	one	more	death	by	murdering	a	birth	controller. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	2.	REFLECTED	IN	THE	NORMAL	CONSCIENCE</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	common	with	irrational	animals	we	have	instincts,	appetites,	and	passions; but,	unlike	the	animals,	we	have	the	power	to	reflect	whether	an	action	is	right	or wrong	in	itself	apart	from	its	consequences.	This	power	of	moral	judgment	is called	conscience;	and	it	is	conscience	which	reflects	the	natural	law	(the	Divine Nature	expressed	in	creation).	As	conscience,	when	violated,	can	and	does	give rise	to	an	unpleasant	feeling	of	shame	in	the	mind,	we	have	good	reason	to believe	that	it	exists	for	the	purpose	of	preventing	us	from	doing	shameful actions,	just	as	our	eyes	are	intended,	amongst	other	things,	to	prevent	us	from walking	over	precipices.	Moreover,	if	the	conscience	is	active,	instructed,	and unbiassed,	it	will	invariably	give	the	correct	answer	to	any	question	of	right	or wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	possible	to	assert,	without	fear	of	contradiction,	that	no	ordinary	decent	man or	woman	approaches	or	begins	the	practice	of	artificial	birth	control	without experiencing	at	first	unpleasant	feelings	of	uneasiness,	hesitation,	repugnance, shame,	and	remorse.	Later	on	these	feelings	may	be	overcome	by	habit,	for	the voice	of	conscience	will	cease	when	it	has	been	frequently	ignored.	This	does</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>not	alter	the	fact	that	at	first	the	natural	moral	instincts	of	both	men	and	women do	revolt	against	these	practices.	To	the	conscience	of	mankind	birth	control	is	a shameful	action. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	3.	EXPRESSED	IN	THE	SCIENCE	OF	ETHICS</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	dictates	of	conscience	go	to	form	the	science	of	ethics.	According	to	ethics, the	practice	of	birth	control	means	the	doing	of	an	act	whilst	at	the	same	time frustrating	the	object	for	which	the	act	is	intended.	It	is	like	using	language	to conceal	the	truth,	or	using	appetite	so	as	to	injure	rather	than	to	promote	health. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During	the	decline	of	the	Roman	Empire	men	gorged	themselves	with	food,	took an	emetic,	vomited,	and	then	sat	down	to	eat	again.	They	satiated	their	appetite and	frustrated	the	object	for	which	appetite	is	intended.	The	practice	of	birth control	is	parallel	to	this	piggishness.	No	one	can	deny	that	the	sexual	impulse has	for	aim	the	procreation	of	children.	The	birth	controllers	seek	to	gratify	the impulse,	yet	to	defeat	the	aim;	and	they	are	so	honest	in	their	mistaken convictions	that,	when	faced	with	this	argument,	they	boldly	adopt	an	attitude which	spells	intellectual	and	moral	anarchy.	They	say	that	it	is	simply	a	waste	of time	to	discuss	the	moral	aspect	of	this	practice.	Without	being	able	to	dispute the	truth	that	birth	control	is	against	nature,	conscience,	and	ethics,	they	attempt to	prove	that	at	any	rate	the	results	of	this	practice	are	beneficial,	or	in	other words	that	a	good	end	justifies	the	use	of	evil	means.	This	is	a	doctrine	that	has been	universally	repudiated	by	mankind.	[101]	Nevertheless,	if	birth	control,	in spite	of	its	being	an	offence	against	moral	and	natural	law,	was	really	beneficial to	humanity,	then	birth	controllers	would	be	able	to	claim	pragmatic	justification for	the	practices,	and	to	argue	that	what	actually	and	universally	tends	to	the good	of	mankind	cannot	be	bad	in	itself.	Birth	control,	as	I	have	already	shown, does	not	conform	to	these	conditions;	therefore	that	argument	also	fails. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	4.	BIRTH	CONTROL	CONDEMNED	BY	PROTESTANT	CHURCHES</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Protestants,	at	the	time	of	the	Reformation,	retained	and	even	exaggerated certain	beliefs	of	the	undivided	Catholic	Church.	None	of	them	doubted,	for instance,	that	the	Bible	was	the	Word	of	God	and	therefore	a	guide	to	moral conduct.	They	knew	that	artificial	birth	control	is	forbidden	by	the	Bible,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a>that	in	the	Old	Testament	the	punishment	for	that	sin	was	death.	[102]	In	1876, when	Charles	Bradlaugh	advocated	in	a	notorious	pamphlet	the	practice	of	birth control,	his	views	were	denounced	from	every	Protestant	pulpit	in	the	land,	and were	widely	repudiated	by	the	upper	and	middle	classes	of	England.	But	it would	seem	that	Protestant	morality	is	now	disappearing	with	the	spread	of indifferentism,	and	the	Protestant	Churches	have	no	longer	the	same	influence on	the	public	and	private	life	of	the	nation.	Protestantism	has	lasted	for	400</p>
<p class="calibre1">years,	but	though	it	has	lasted	longer	than	any	other	form	of	belief	which	took rise	in	the	sixteenth	century,	it	is	now	also	dying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	1919	the	number	of	people	over	seven	years	of	age	in	England	who	professed belief	in	 <i class="calibre4">any</i>	church	was	10,833,795	(out	of	40,000,000),	and	the	church attendance	equalled	7,000,000,	or	about	1	out	of	every	5	people.	[103]</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again,	a	Commission	appointed	by	the	Protestant	Churches	to	inquire	into	the religious	beliefs	held	in	the	British	armies	of	the	Great	War	has	endorsed	the following	statements:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Everyone	must	be	struck	with	the	appalling	ignorance	of	the	simplest religious	truths.	Probably	80	per	cent,	of	these	men	from	the	Midlands had	never	heard	of	the	sacraments….	It	is	not	only	that	the	men	do not	know	the	meaning	of	‘Church	of	England’;	they	are	ignorant	of	the historical	facts	of	the	life	of	our	Lord.	Nor	must	it	be	assumed	that this	ignorance	is	confined	to	men	who	have	passed	through	the elementary	schools.	The	same	verdict	is	recorded	upon	those	who	have been	educated	in	our	public	schools….	The	men	are	hopelessly perplexed	by	the	lack	of	Christian	unity.”	[104]</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	my	opinion	these	statements	are	exaggerations,	but	that	was	not	the	view	of the	Commission.	As	regards	Scotland,	it	has	recently	been	stated	at	the	Lothian</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a>Synod	of	the	United	Free	Church	that	in	1911	at	least	37	per	cent.	of	the	men	and women	of	Scotland	were	without	church	connection.	[105]</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	1870,	of	every	1,000	marriages,	760	were	according	to	the	rites	of	the Established	Church,	but	in	1919	the	proportion	had	fallen	to	597.	During	the same	period	civil	marriages	without	religious	ceremonial	increased	from	98	to 231	per	1,000.	[106]	These	figures	are	an	index	of	the	religious	complexion	of the	country.	The	Protestant	Churches	are	being	strangled	by	the	development	of a	germ	that	was	inherent	in	them	from	the	beginning,	and	that	growth	is Rationalism.	The	majority	of	the	upper,	professional,	and	artisan	class	can	no longer	be	claimed	as	staunch	Protestants,	but	as	vague	theists;	and	amongst	these educated	people,	misled	by	false	ideas	of	pleasure	and	by	pernicious	nonsense written	about	self-realisation,	the	practice	of	birth	control	has	spread	most alarmingly.	This	is	an	evil	against	which	all	religious	bodies	who	retain	a	belief in	the	fundamental	facts	of	Christianity	might	surely	unite	in	action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	a	Catholic	country	there	would	be	no	need,	in	the	furtherance	of	public welfare,	to	write	on	the	evils	of	birth	control.	The	teaching	of	the	Catholic Church	would	be	generally	accepted,	and	a	moral	law	generally	accepted	by	the inhabitants	of	a	country	gives	strength	to	the	State.	But	Great	Britain,	no	longer Catholic,	is	now	in	some	danger	of	ceasing	to	be	even	a	Christian	country.	In 1885	it	was	asserted,	“England	alone	is	reported	to	contain	some	seven	hundred sects,	each	of	whom	proves	a	whole	system	of	theology	and	morals	from	the Bible.”	[107]	Each	of	these	that	now	survives	gives	its	own	particular explanation	of	the	law	of	God,	which	it	honestly	tries	to	follow,	but	at	one	point or	another	each	and	every	sect	differs	from	its	neighbours.	On	account	of	these differences	of	opinion	many	people	say:	“The	Churches	cannot	agree	amongst themselves	as	to	what	is	truth;	they	cannot	all	be	right;	it	is,	therefore,	impossible for	me	to	know	with	certainty	what	to	believe;	and,	to	be	quite	honest,	it	may save	me	a	lot	of	bother	just	at	present	to	have	no	very	firm	belief	at	all.”	This means	that	in	Great	Britain	 <i class="calibre4">there	is	no	uniform	moral	law	covering	all	human</i> <i class="calibre4">conduct	and	generally	accepted	by	the	mass	of	the	people</i>.	As	the	practice	of artificial	birthrate	control	is	not	only	contrary	to	Christian	morality,	but	is	also	a menace	to	the	prosperity	and	well-being	of	the	nation,	the	absence	of	a	uniform moral	law,	common	to	all	the	people	and	forbidding	this	practice,	is	a	source	of grave	weakness	in	the	State. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>APPENDIX	TO	CHAPTER	VIII</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">A	NEO-MALTHUSIAN	ATTACK	ON	THE	CHURCH	OF	ENGLAND</p>
<p class="calibre1">As	was	proved	in	a	previous	chapter	(p.	120)	artificial	birth	control	was originally	based	on	Atheism,	and	on	a	philosophy	of	moral	anarchy.	Further proof	of	this	fact	is	to	be	found	in	the	course	of	a	most	edifying	dispute	between two	rival	Neo-Malthusians.	This	quarrel	is	between	Dr.	Marie	C.	Stopes, President	of	the	Society	for	Constructive	Birth	Control	and	Racial	Progress,	who is	not	a	Doctor	of	Medicine	but	of	Philosophy,	and	Dr.	Binnie	Dunlop,	who	is	a Bachelor	of	Medicine:	and	when	birth	controllers	fall	out	we	may	humbly	hope that	truth	will	prevail.	Dr.	Stopes	maintains	that	artificial	birth	control	was	not	an atheistic	movement,	whereas	Dr.	Binnie	Dunlop	contends	that	the	pioneers	of	the movement	were	Atheists.	The	beginning	of	the	trouble	was	a	letter	written	by Dr.	Stopes	to	the	 <i class="calibre4">British	Medical	Journal</i>,	in	which	she	made	the	following statement:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Dr.	Martindale	is	reported	in	your	pages	to	have	given	an	address	to medical	women	in	which	she	pointed	out	that	the	birth	control	movement in	England	dated	from	the	Bradlaugh	trial	in	1877.	Had	she	attended	the presidential	address	of	the	Society	for	Constructive	Birth	Control	she would	have	learned	that	there	was	a	very	flourishing	movement,	centring round	Dr.	Trall	in	1866,	years	before	Bradlaugh	touched	the	subject, and	also	a	considerable	movement	earlier	than	that.	This	point	is important,	as	‘birth	control’	has	hitherto	(erroneously)	been	much prejudiced	in	popular	opinion	by	being	supposed	to	be	an	atheistical movement	originated	by	Bradlaugh.”	[108]</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>Dr.	Stopes,	who	has	been	working	overtime	in	the	attempt	to	obtain	some religious	sanction	for	her	propaganda,	is	ready	not	only	to	throw	the	Atheists overboard,	but	also	to	assert	that	a	flourishing	movement	for	artificial	birth control	centred	round	the	late	Dr.	Trall,	who	was	a	Christian.	Her	letter	was answered	by	Dr.	Binnie	Dunlop	as	follows:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Dr.	Marie	C.	Stopes,	whose	valuable	books	I	constantly	recommend, protests	(page	872)	against	the	statement	that	the	birth	control movement	in	England	dated	from	the	trial	of	Charles	Bradlaugh	in 1877—for	re-publishing	Dr.	Knowlton’s	pamphlet,	_The	Fruits	of Philosophy_	because	the	Government	had	interdicted	it.	She	must	admit, however,	that	there	was	no	 <i class="calibre4">organised</i>	movement	anywhere	until Bradlaugh	and	the	Doctors	Drysdale,	immediately	after	the	trial, founded	the	Malthusian	League,	and	that	the	decline	of	Europe’s birthrate	began	in	that	year.	It	may	now	seem	unfortunate	that	the pioneers	of	the	contraceptives	idea,	from	1818	onwards	(James	Mill, Francis	Place,	Richard	Carlile,	Robert	Dale	Owen,	John	Stuart	Mill,	Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Knowlton,	Dr.	George	Drysdale,	Dr.	C.R.	Drysdale,	and	Charles Bradlaugh),	were	all	Free-thinkers;	and	Dr.	Stopes	harps	on	the religious	and	praiseworthy	Dr.	Trall,	an	American,	who	published <i class="calibre4">Sexual	Physiology</i>	in	1866.	But	Dr.	Trall	was	not	at	all	a	strong advocate	of	contraceptive	methods.	After	a	brief	but	helpful	reference to	the	idea	of	placing	a	mechanical	obstruction,	such	as	a	sponge, </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Let	it	be	distinctly	understood	that	I	do	not	approve	any	method	for preventing	pregnancy	except	that	of	abstinence,	nor	any	means	for producing	abortion,	on	the	ground	that	it	is	or	can	be	in	any	sense physiological.	It	is	only	the	least	of	two	evils.	When	people	will	live physiologically	there	will	be	no	need	of	preventive	measures,	nor	will there	be	any	need	for	works	of	this	kind.”	[109]</p>
<p class="calibre1">That	is	a	most	informative	letter.	In	simple	language	Dr.	Binnie	Dunlop	tells	the remarkable	story	of	how	in	1876	three	Atheists,	merely	by	forming	a	little Society	in	London,	were	able	to	cause	an	immediate	fall	in	the	birthrate	of Europe.	When	you	come	to	think	of	it,	that	was	a	stupendous	thing	for	any	three men	to	have	achieved.	I	am	very	glad	that	Dr.	Binnie	Dunlop	has	defended	the Atheists	and	has	painted	the	late	Dr.	Trail,	despite	that	“brief	but	helpful reference,”	in	his	true	colours	as	a	Christian.	Nevertheless,	Dr.	Stopes	had	the last	word:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“As	regards	Dr.	Dunlop,	he	now	shifts	the	Atheists’	position	by	adding the	word	‘organised.’	The	Atheists	never	tire	of	repeating	certain definite	misstatements,	examples	of	which	are:	‘If	it	were	not	for	the fact	that	the	despised	Atheists,	Charles	Bradlaugh	and	Annie	Besant, faced	imprisonment,	misrepresentation,	insult,	and	ostracism	for	this cause	forty-four	years	ago,	she	[Dr.	Stopes]	would	not	be	able	to conduct	her	campaign	to-day’	(_Literary	Guide_,	November,	1921);	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>‘Before	the	Knowlton	trial,	neither	rich	nor	poor	knew	anything	worth counting	about	contraceptive	devices’	(_Malthusian_,	November	15, 1921).	Variations	of	these	statements	have	been	incessantly	made,	and	I dealt	with	their	contentions	in	the	presidential	address	for	the	C.B.C. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile	to	them	I	reply	that:	‘There	has	never	been	in	this	country any	law	against	the	dissemination	of	properly	presented	birth	control information,	and	 <i class="calibre4">before,	during,	and	after</i>	the	Bradlaugh	trial properly	presented	information	on	birth	control	was	extending	its	range with	full	liberty.’	My	address	is	now	in	the	press,	and	when	published will	make	public	not	only	new	matter	from	manuscript	letters	of	very early	date	in	my	possession,	but	other	overlooked	historical	facts.	I have	already	told	Dr.	Dunlop	I	refuse	to	be	drawn	into	a	discussion	on facts	an	account	of	which	is	still	in	the	press.”	[110]</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lady,	by	her	dissertation	on	the	Laws	of	England,	makes	a	clumsy	effort	to evade	the	point	at	issue,	which	is	quite	simple,	namely,	whether	it	was	Atheists or	Christians	who	initiated	the	Neo-Malthusian	movement,	organised	or unorganised.	Dr.	Binnie	Dunlop	has	here	proved	his	case.	I	also	do	maintain	that in	this	matter	all	credit	must	be	given	to	the	Atheists;	and	that	it	would	be	truly contemptible	to	deny	this	fact	merely	in	order	to	pander	to	a	popular	prejudice against	Atheism.	Nor	am	I	shaken	in	this	opinion	when	Dr.	Stopes	points	out	that there	was	a	Neo-Malthusian	movement	prior	to	1876.	Of	course	there	was	a movement,	but	it	was	always	an	atheistic	movement.	In	the	past	no	Christian doctor,	and	indeed	no	Christian	man	or	woman,	advocated	artificial	birth	control. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let	us	give	the	Neo-Malthusian	his	due. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Until	recently	both	the	Church	of	England	and	the	medical	profession	presented practically	a	united	front	against	Neo-Malthusian	teaching;	and,	as	late	as	1914, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>the	Malthusian	League	did	not	hesitate	to	make	use	of	the	following	calumnies, very	mean,	very	spiteful,	very	imbecile:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Take	the	clergy.	They	are	the	officers	of	a	Church	that	has	made marriage	a	source	of	revenue	and	of	social	control;	they	preach	from	a sacred	book	that	bids	the	chosen	people	of	God	‘multiply	and	replenish the	earth’;	they	know	that	large	families	generally	tend	to	preserve clerical	influence	and	authority;	and	they	claim	that	every	baby	is	a new	soul	presented	to	God	and,	therefore,	for	His	honour	and	glory,	the greatest	possible	number	of	souls	should	be	produced.”	[111]</p>
<p class="calibre1">That	feeble	attempt	to	poison	the	atmosphere	was	naturally	ignored	by intelligent	people;	and	more	than	once	Lambeth	has	ruled	that	artificial	birth control	is	sin.	Unfortunately,	within	the	Church	of	England,	in	spite	of	the Lambeth	ruling,	there	is	still	discussion	as	to	whether	artificial	birth	control	is	or is	not	sin,	the	Bishops,	as	a	whole,	making	a	loyal	effort	to	uphold	Christian teaching	against	a	campaign	waged	by	Malthusians	in	order	to	obtain	religious sanction	for	their	evil	propaganda.	Although	many	Malthusians	are	rationalists, they	are	well	aware	that	without	some	religious	sanction	their	policy	could	never emerge	from	the	dim	underworld	of	unmentioned	and	unrespected	things,	and could	never	be	advocated	openly	in	the	light	of	day.	To	this	end	birth	control	is camouflaged	by	pseudo-poetic	and	pseudo-religious	phraseology,	and	the Anglican	Church	is	asked	to	alter	her	teaching.	Birth	controllers	realise	that	it	is useless	to	ask	this	of	the	Catholic	Church,	a	Rock	in	their	path,	but	“as	regards the	Church	of	England,	which	makes	no	claim	to	infallibility,	the	case	is different,	and	discussion	is	possible.”	[112]</p>
<p class="calibre1">Let	us	consider,	firstly,	the	teaching	of	the	Church	of	England	on	this	matter.	At the	Lambeth	Conference	of	1908	the	Bishops	affirmed	“that	deliberate tampering	with	nascent	life	is	repugnant	to	Christian	morality.”	In	1914	a Committee	of	Bishops	issued	a	Memorandum	[113]	in	which	artificial	birth control	is	condemned	as	“dangerous,	demoralising,	and	sinful.”	The</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a>memorandum	was	approved	by	a	large	majority	of	the	Diocesan	Bishops, although	in	the	opinion	of	Dean	Inge	“this	is	emphatically	a	matter	in	which every	man	and	woman	must	judge	for	themselves,	and	must	refrain	from	judging others.”	[114]	The	Bishops	also	held	that	in	some	marriages	it	may	be	desirable, on	grounds	of	prudence	or	of	health,	to	limit	the	number	of	children.	In	these circumstances	they	advised	the	practice	of	self-restraint;	and,	as	regards	a	limited use	of	marriage,	they	added	the	following	statement:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“It	seems	to	most	of	us	only	a	legitimate	application	of	such self-restraint	that	in	certain	cases	(which	only	the	parties’	own judgment	and	conscience	can	settle)	intercourse	should	be	restricted	by consent	to	certain	times	at	which	it	is	less	likely	to	lead	to conception.	This	is	only	to	use	natural	conditions;	it	is	approved	by good	medical	authority;	it	means	self-denial	and	not	self-indulgence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	we	believe	it	to	be	quite	legitimate,	or	at	least	not	to	be condemned.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 <i class="calibre4">small</i>	minority	of	Bishops	held	that	prolonged	or	even	perpetual	abstinence from	intercourse	is	the	only	legitimate	method	of	limiting	a	family.	Finally,	in Resolution	68	of	the	Lambeth	Conference	in	1920,	the	Bishops	stated	that:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“We	utter	an	emphatic	warning	against	the	use	of	unnatural	means	for the	avoidance	of	conception,	together	with	the	grave dangers—physical,	moral,	and	religious—thereby	incurred,	and	against the	evils	with	which	the	extension	of	such	use	threatens	the	race.	In opposition	to	the	teaching	which,	under	the	name	of	science	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a>religion,	encourages	married	people	in	the	deliberate	cultivation	of sexual	union	as	an	end	in	itself,	we	steadfastly	uphold	what	must always	be	regarded	as	the	governing	consideration	of	Christian marriage.	One	is	the	primary	purpose	for	which	marriage exists—namely,	the	continuation	of	the	race	through	the	gift	and heritage	of	children;	the	other	is	the	paramount	importance	in	married life	of	deliberate	and	thoughtful	self-control.”	[115]</p>
<p class="calibre1">And	the	Committee	on	“Problems	of	Marriage	and	Sexual	Morality”	felt	called upon	“to	utter	an	earnest	warning	against	the	use	of	any	unnatural	means	by which	conception	is	frustrated.”	[116]</p>
<p class="calibre1">If	Resolution	68	be	read	in	conjunction	with	the	Memorandum	of	1914,	the teaching	of	the	Church	of	England	is	plain	to	any	sane	man	or	woman;	it	is	one with	the	teaching	of	the	Church	Catholic.	Artificial	birth	control	is	condemned as	sin,	but,	under	certain	circumstances,	the	limitation	of	a	family	by	continence or	by	 <i class="calibre4">restricted	intercourse</i>	is	permitted.	As	this	teaching	forbids	Neo-Malthusian	practices,	birth	controllers	have	tried	to	make	the	Church	alter	her teaching	to	suit	their	opinions.	Although	their	methods	in	controversy	against	the Church	must	be	condemned	by	everyone	who	values	intellectual	honesty,	the reader,	of	his	charity,	should	remember	that	Malthusians	are	unable	to	defend their	policy,	either	on	logical	or	on	moral	grounds.	Without	attempting	to	prove that	the	teaching	of	the	Church	is	wrong,	birth	controllers	began	the	attack	by	 <i class="calibre4">a</i> <i class="calibre4">complete	misrepresentation</i>	of	what	that	teaching	actually	is.	This	unenviable task	was	undertaken	by	Lord	Dawson	of	Penn,	at	the	Birmingham	Church Congress	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">1921. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">After	quoting	Resolution	68,	Lord	Dawson	said:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>“Now	the	plain	meaning	of	this	statement	is	that	sexual	union	should take	place	for	the	sole	purpose	of	procreation,	that	sexual	union	as <i class="calibre4">an</i>	end	in	itself—not,	mind	you,  <i class="calibre4">the</i>	only	end—(there	we	should	all agree),	but	sexual	union	as	 <i class="calibre4">an</i>	end	in	itself	is	to	be	condemned. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“That	means	that	sexual	intercourse	should	rightly	take	place	 <i class="calibre4">only</i> for	the	purpose	of	procreation. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Quite	a	large	family	could	easily	result	from	quite	a	few	sexual unions.	For	the	rest	the	couple	should	be	celibate.	Any	intercourse	not having	procreation	as	its	intention	is	‘sexual	union	as	an	end	in itself,’	and	therefore	by	inference	condemned	by	the	Lambeth Conference. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Think	of	the	facts	of	life.	Let	us	recall	our	own	love—our	marriage, our	honeymoon.	Has	not	sexual	union	over	and	over	again	been	the physical	expression	of	our	love	without	thought	or	intention	of procreation?	Have	we	all	been	wrong?	Or	is	it	that	the	Church	lacks that	vital	contact	with	the	realities	of	life	which	accounts	for	the gulf	between	her	and	the	people? </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a>“The	love	envisaged	by	the	Lambeth	Conference	is	an	invertebrate, joyless	thing—not	worth	the	having.	Fortunately	it	is	in	contrast	to the	real	thing	as	practised	by	clergy	and	laity. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Fancy	an	ardent	lover	(and	what	respect	have	you	for	a	lover	who	is not	ardent?)—the	type	you	would	like	your	daughter	to	marry—virile, ambitious,	chivalrous—a	man	who	means	to	work	hard	and	love	hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fancy	putting	before	these	lovers—eager	and	expectant	of	the	joys before	them—the	Lambeth	picture	of	marriage.	Do	you	expect	to	gain their	confidence?”	[117]</p>
<p class="calibre1">That	sort	of	appeal	is	not	very	effective,	even	as	rhetoric;	but	it	is	very	easy	to give	an	exact	parallel.	Fancy	a	fond	father	(and	what	respect	have	you	for	a father	who	is	not	fond?)	being	told	by	his	daughter’s	suitor	that	he,	his prospective	son-in-law,	looked	forward	to	the	physical	joys	of	marriage,	but intended	to	insist	on	his	wife	using	contraceptives.	Would	any	father	regard	such a	one	as	the	type	he	would	like	his	daughter	to	marry? </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	is,	unfortunately,	another	answer	to	Lord	Dawson,	and	I	put	it	in	the	form of	a	question.	Can	any	intelligent	man	or	woman,	Catholic,	Protestant,	or rationalist,	maintain	that	Lord	Dawson	has	given	a	fair,	a	true,	or	an	honest statement	of	the	teaching	of	the	Church	of	England?	Moreover,	it	is	past	all understanding	how	a	gross	libel	on	Anglican	doctrine	has	been	overlooked	by those	most	concerned.	The	address	is	actually	hailed	as	“wise,	bold,	and	humane in	the	highest	sense	of	the	word”	by	 <i class="calibre4">The	Spectator</i>,	[118]	and	that	amazing journal,	“expert	as	ever	in	making	the	worse	appear	the	better	cause	in	a	way	that appeals	to	clergymen,”	goes	on	to	say:	“Lord	Dawson	fearlessly	and	plainly opposed	the	teachings	of	the	Roman	Church	and	the	alleged	teachings	of	the Anglican.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having	by	a	travesty	of	truth	created	a	false	theological	bogey,	bearing	little</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a>resemblance	either	to	Catholic	or	to	Anglican	teaching,	Lord	Dawson	proceeds to	demolish	his	own	creation	by	a	somewhat	boisterous	eulogy	of	sex-love.	Now sex-love	is	an	instinct	and	involves	no	question	of	good	or	evil	apart	from	the circumstances	in	which	it	is	either	gratified	or	denied;	but,	in	view	of	the freedom	with	which	Lord	Dawson	discussed	this	topic,	it	is	only	right	to	note that	it	was	left	to	the	Rev.	R.J.	Campbell	to	add	to	the	gaiety	of	nations	by	his subsequent	protest	that	the	 <i class="calibre4">Marriage	Service</i>	“contains	expressions	which	are offensive	to	modern	delicacy	of	feeling.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	protest	is	also	a	first-rate	example	of	the	anarchical	state	of	the	modern mind.	The	Rev.	R.J.	Campbell	is	a	modern	mind,	so	is	Mr.	George	Bernard Shaw;	but	the	latter	refers	to	“the	sober	decency,	earnestness,	and	authority” </p>
<p class="calibre1">[119]	of	those	very	passages	to	which	the	former	objects. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord	Dawson’s	eulogy	of	sexual	intercourse	was	but	a	prelude	to	his	plea	for	the use	of	contraceptives:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	will	next	consider	Artificial	Control.	The	forces	in	modern	life which	make	for	birth	control	are	so	strong	that	only	convincing	reasons will	make	people	desist	from	it.	It	is	said	to	be	unnatural	and intrinsically	immoral.	This	word	‘unnatural’	perplexes	me.	Why? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Civilisation	involves	the	chaining	of	natural	forces	and	their conversion	to	man’s	will	and	uses.	Much	of	medicine	and	surgery consists	of	means	to	overcome	nature.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	paragraph	illustrates	precisely	the	confused	use	of	the	word	“natural,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">which	I	have	already	criticised	(p.	124).	Lord	Dawson	says	he	is	perplexed,	and	I agree	with	him.	Civilisation,	he	says,	involves	the	conversion	of	natural	forces	to man’s	will.	So	does	every	crime.	Is	that	any	defence	of	crime?	Even	if	physical nature	be	described	as	non-moral,	that	description	cannot	be	applied	to	the inward	nature	of	will	and	conscience.	That	I	will	an	act	may	show	it	is	in accordance	with	nature	in	a	certain	sense,	but	the	fact	of	its	being	in	accordance</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>with	physical	nature	does	not	justify	my	act.	Does	Lord	Dawson	agree?	Or	does he	think	that	any	action	in	accordance	with	the	physical	laws	of	nature,	which means	any	action	whatsoever,	is	justified;	and	does	he	approve	therefore	of	mere moral	anarchy?	His	confusion	of	thought	concerning	the	use	of	the	word</p>
<p class="calibre1">“natural”	is	followed	by	the	inevitable	sequence	of	false	analogies:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“When	anaesthetics	were	first	used	at	childbirth	there	was	an	outcry on	the	part	of	many	worthy	and	religious	people	that	their	use	under such	circumstances	was	unnatural	and	wicked,	because	God	meant	woman	to suffer	the	struggles	and	pains	of	childbirth.	Now	we	all	admit	it	is right	to	control	the	process	of	childbirth,	and	to	save	the	mother	as much	pain	as	possible.	It	is	no	more	unnatural	to	control	conception	by artificial	means	than	to	control	childbirth	by	artificial	means. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Surely	the	whole	question	turns	on	whether	these	artificial	means	are for	the	good	or	harm	of	the	individual	and	the	community. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Generally	speaking,	birth	control	before	the	first	child	is inadvisable.	On	the	other	hand,	the	justifiable	use	of	birth	control would	seem	to	be	to	limit	the	number	of	children	when	such	is desirable,	and	to	spread	out	their	arrival	in	such	a	way	as	to	serve their	true	interests	and	those	of	their	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Once	more,	careful	distinction	needs	to	be	made	between	the	use	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a>the	bad	effects	of	the	abuse	of	birth	control.	That	its	abuse	produces grave	harm	I	fully	agree—harm	to	parents,	to	families,	and	to	the nation.	But	abuse	is	not	a	just	condemnation	of	legitimate	use. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over-eating,	over-drinking,	over-smoking,	over-sleeping,	overwork	do not	carry	condemnation	of	eating,	drinking,	smoking,	sleeping,	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">These	long	extracts	are	here	quoted	because,	as	 <i class="calibre4">The	Spectator</i>	has	remarked,	“an attempt	at	a	detailed	summary	might	destroy	the	careful	balance	which	is essential	to	Lord	Dawson’s	purpose.”	It	might	indeed;	and	many	a	true	word	is written	inadvertently	and	despite	the	wisdom	of	the	serpent.	As	Lord	Dawson believes	that	Malthusian	practice	is	not	of	necessity	sinful,	and	as	he	is	urging the	Church	to	remove	a	ban	on	that	practice,	it	is	necessary	for	him	to	prove	in the	first	place	that	his	opinion	is	right	and	that	the	teaching	of	the	Church	is wrong.	Elsewhere	in	these	pages	I	have	stated	 <i class="calibre4">the	reasons	why</i>	Christian morality	brands	the	 <i class="calibre4">act</i>	of	artificial	birth	control	as	intrinsically	a	sin,	a	 <i class="calibre4">malum	in</i> <i class="calibre4">se</i>,	and	those	reasons	have	never	been	disproved	by	Lord	Dawson	or	by	anyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	comparison	between	the	use	of	contraceptives	and	eating	or	drinking	is	a false	analogy.	Eating	is	a	natural	act,	not	in	itself	sinful,	whereas	the	use	of contraceptives	is	an	unnatural	act,	in	itself	a	sin.	The	extent	to	which	artificial birth	control	is	practised	neither	increases	nor	diminishes	the	sinful	nature	of	the act,	but	merely	indicates	the	number	of	times	the	same	sin	is	committed.	Lord Dawson	admits	the	danger	of	Neo-Malthusian	methods	being	carried	to	excess, and	counsels	that	these	practices	be	used	in	moderation;	but	is	it	likely	that	those who	have	discarded	the	teaching	of	a	Church	and	the	dictates	of	the	moral	law will	be	seriously	influenced	by	what	he	calls	“an	appeal	to	patriotism”? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	there	is	one	appeal	to	patriotism	which	Lord	Dawson	could	have	made	but did	not	make.	He	might	have	pleaded	that	for	the	sake	of	the	nation	all	attempts at	unnatural	birth	control	amongst	the	wealthier	and	more	leisured	citizens should	be	abandoned	forthwith,	and	that	the	lawful	form	should	be	confined	to those	few	cases	where	limitation	of	the	family	is	justified	on	genuine	medical grounds.	But	he	refrained	from	making	that	appeal,	and	his	plea	for	the	use	of contraceptives	in	moderation	is	more	likely	to	be	quoted	with	approval	in	the boudoirs	of	Mayfair	than	in	humbler	homes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord	Dawson’s	grave	error	in	failing	to	anticipate	the	inevitable	consequences	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>his	deplorable	speech	is	becoming	more	and	more	apparent.	In	the	columns	of <i class="calibre4">The	Daily	Herald</i>,	cheek	by	jowl	with	advertisements	concerning	“Herbalists,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Safe	and	Sure	Treatment	for	Anaemia,	Irregularities,	etc.,”	“Knowledge	for Young	Wives,”	and	“Surgical	Goods	and	Appliances,”	there	appears	the following	notice:</p>

<p class="calibre1">Lord	Dawson’s	advice	was	indeed	perilous	because	“the	British	Empire	and	all its	traditions	will	decline	and	fall	if	the	Motherland	is	faithless	to	motherhood”; </p>

<p class="calibre1">All	Lord	Dawson’s	arguments	are	hoary	fallacies.	“Once	more,	careful distinction	needs	to	be	made	between”—anaesthetics	and	contraceptives. </p>

<p class="calibre1">THE	TEACHING	OF	THE	CATHOLIC	CHURCH	ON	BIRTH	CONTROL</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	1.	A	FALSE	VIEW	OF	HER	DOCTRINE</p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	marks	of	the	Catholic	Church,	whereby	she	may	be	distinguished from	all	other	Churches,	is	that	her	teaching	is	always	clear	and	above	all logical.	Yet	this	fact	has	not	saved	her	teaching	from	misrepresentation	in	the hands	of	Malthusians.	For	example,	Dr.	C.	Killick	Millard	writes	as	follows:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Churches	have	taught	that	it	was	the	divine	wish	that	human	beings should	multiply	and	population	increase—the	more	rapidly	the	better; the	traditional	authority	for	this	being	the	instruction	given	to	Noah and	his	family,	after	the	Deluge,	to	‘be	fruitful	and	multiply	and replenish	the	earth.’	The	Churches	have	continued	to	teach	that	the duty	of	man	was	 <i class="calibre4">to	obey	the	divine	command</i>	and	still	_to	increase	and multiply_,	and	until	recently	any	attempt	by	married	couples	to restrict	or	regulate	the	birthrate	was	denounced	as	sinful. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	still	the	orthodox	attitude,	I	believe,	of	the	Roman	Catholic Church,	with	its	celibate	priesthood;	but,	as	it	is	clearly	useless	to reason	with	those	who	claim	infallibility,	it	is	unnecessary	to	discuss</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>the	question	further	so	far	as	Roman	Catholicism	is	concerned.”	[122]</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now,	although	it	may	be	unnecessary	for	Dr.	Millard	to	discuss	the	question further,	he	will,	I	am	sure,	regret	having	inadvertently	misstated	the	truth.	The Catholic	Church	has	never	denounced	as	sinful	“<i class="calibre4">any</i>	attempt	by	married	couples to	restrict	or	regulate	the	birthrate.”	On	the	contrary,	the	Catholic	Church	has taught,	by	her	greatest	doctor,	St.	Thomas	Aquinas,	“that	the	essence	of	marriage is	not	primarily	in	the	begetting	of	offspring,	but	in	the	indissoluble	union between	husband	and	wife.”	[123]</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	2.	THE	ESSENCE	AND	PURPOSE	OF	MARRIAGE</p>
<p class="calibre1">There	is	an	obvious	distinction	between	the	 <i class="calibre4">essence</i>	of	a	thing	and	the	 <i class="calibre4">ends</i>	or purposes	for	which	the	thing	exists.	For	example,	in	a	business	partnership	the <i class="calibre4">essence</i>	of	the	partnership	is	a	legal	instrument,	whereas	the	 <i class="calibre4">purposes</i>	or	 <i class="calibre4">ends</i>	of the	partnership	are	various	commercial	projects.	The	following	is	a	clear statement,	by	Father	Vincent	McNabb,	O.P.,	[124]	of	Catholic	teaching concerning	the	nature	and	end	of	marriage:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Marriage	is	an	indissoluble	state	of	life	wherein	a	man	and	a	woman agree	to	give	each	other	power	over	their	bodies	for	the	begetting, birth,	and	upbringing	of	offspring.	The	natural	and	primary	end	of marriage	is	this	duty	towards	offspring.	But,	as	sin	has	despoiled	the human	will	and	disturbed	human	relations,	marriage	has	now	the secondary	end	of	allaying	sexual	lust. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“But	it	is	a	principle	of	ethics	that	what	is	primary	cannot	be	set aside	as	if	it	were	secondary,	nor	can	the	secondary	be	sought	as	if	it</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>were	primary.	To	invert	the	ethical	order	is	to	bring	in	that	disorder which	is	called	sin.	If	the	human	act	brings	in	a	slight	disorder,	it is	venial	sin;	if	the	human	act	brings	in	a	grievous	disorder	it	is	a grievous	or	mortal	sin. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	a	grievous	disorder,	and,	therefore,	a	grievous	sin,	to	desire satisfaction	in	such	sexual	intercourse	as	could	not	result	in	the begetting	of	offspring. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“As	the	wedded	pair	have	given	each	other	power	over	their	bodies	it would	be	a	grave	sin	for	one	to	refuse	either	altogether	or	for	a considerable	time	the	fulfilment	of	the	marriage	debt.	But	it	is	not	a sin	if	by	mutual	agreement	the	wedded	pair	refrain	from	the	marriage debt	for	a	time,	or	for	ever.	As	a	rule,	and	speaking	objectively,	it would	be	heroic	virtue	for	a	wedded	pair	to	abstain	for	a	long	time, and	still	more	for	ever,	from	the	marriage	debt.	To	counsel	such	a practice	indiscriminately	would	be	a	sinful	want	of	prudence,	and,	in	a confessor,	of	professional	knowledge. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	quite	clear	that	by	mutual	consent,	even	without	any	further motive,	the	wedded	pair	can	abstain	from	marital	intercourse.	Still</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>more	may	they	abstain	for	a	time	or	for	ever,	for	a	good	motive,  <i class="calibre4">e.g. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">in	order	to	have	time	for	prayer,	for	good	works,	for	bringing	up	such family	as	they	already	have	to	support.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	3.	ARTIFICIAL	STERILITY	WHOLLY	CONDEMNED</p>
<p class="calibre1">Artificial	birth	control	is	an	offence	against	the	law	of	God,	and	is	therefore forbidden	by	the	Catholic	Church.	Any	Catholic	who	wilfully	adopts	this practice	violates	the	law	of	God	in	a	serious	matter,	and	is	therefore	guilty	of mortal	sin,	an	outrageous	and	deliberate	insult	offered	by	a	human	creature	to	the Infinite	Majesty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Catholic	Church	teaches	that	men	and	women	should	control	the	sex impulse	just	as	they	should	control	their	appetite	for	food	or	drink.	The	principal end	of	marriage,	as	we	have	seen,	is	the	purpose	of	its	institution,	the	procreation and	bringing	up	of	children.	The	secondary	end	of	marriage	is	mutual	assistance and	companionship,	and	a	remedy	against	concupiscence.	Where	it	is	advisable, owing	to	the	health	of	the	mother	or	owing	to	reasons	of	prudence	as	distinct from	selfishness,	to	limit	the	number	of	children,	the	Catholic	Church	points	out that	this	should	be	done	by	the	exercise	of	self-control,	or	by	restricted	use.	As those	who	deny	the	possibility	or	even	the	wisdom	of	self-restraint	are	not	likely to	pay	the	slightest	attention	to	the	teaching	of	the	Church,	I	will	quote	the opinions	of	two	clear-thinking,	non-Catholic	writers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	George	Bernard	Shaw	has	said:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	no	prejudices.	The	superstitious	view	of	the	Catholic	Church	is that	a	priest	is	something	entirely	different	from	an	ordinary	man.	I know	a	great	many	Catholic	priests,	and	they	are	men	who	have	had	a great	deal	of	experience.	They	have	at	the	back	a	Church	which	has	had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a>for	many	years	to	consider	the	giving	of	domestic	advice	to	people.	If you	go	to	a	Catholic	priest	and	tell	him	that	a	life	of	sexual abstinence	means	a	life	of	utter	misery,	he	laughs.	And	obviously	for	a very	good	reason.	If	you	go	to	Westminster	Cathedral	you	will	hear voices	which	sound	extremely	well,	and	very	differently	from	the	voices of	the	gentlemen	who	sing	at	music-halls,	and	who	would	not	be	able	to sing	in	that	way	if	they	did	not	lead	a	life	extremely	different	from the	Catholic	priest…. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	may	say	that	I	am	in	favour	of	birth	control.	I	am	in	favour	of	it for	its	own	sake.	I	do	not	like	to	see	any	human	being	absolutely	the slave	of	what	we	used	to	call	‘Nature.’	Every	human	action	ought	to	be controlled,	and	you	make	a	step	in	civilisation	with	something	which has	been	uncontrollable.	I	am	therefore	in	favour	of	control	for	its own	sake.	But	when	you	go	from	that	to	the	methods	of	control,	that	is a	very	different	thing.	As	Dr.	Routh	said,	we	have	to	find	out	methods which	will	not	induce	people	to	declare	that	they	cannot	exist	without sexual	intercourse.”	[125]</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	course	the	use	of	contraceptives	is	the	very	negation	of	self-control. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	late	Sir	William	Osier,	speaking	of	venereal	disease,	says:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a>“Personal	purity	is	the	prophylaxis	which	we	as	physicians	are especially	bound	to	advocate.	Continence	may	be	a	hard	condition	…</p>
<p class="calibre1">but	it	can	be	borne,	and	it	is	our	duty	to	urge	this	lesson	upon	young and	old	who	seek	our	advice	on	matters	sexual.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	4.	THE	ONLY	LAWFUL	METHOD	OF	BIRTH	CONTROL</p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 <i class="calibre4">are</i>	methods	of	control	whereby	people	are	enabled	to	exist,	and	to	exist happily,	without	being	slaves	to	the	sex	impulse.	These	methods	are	those	of	the Catholic	Church.	Her	people	are	encouraged	to	take	a	higher	and	a	nobler	view of	marriage,	to	overcome	their	egoism	and	selfishness,	and	to	practise moderation	and	self-restraint	in	the	lawful	use	of	marital	rights.	The	Church urges	her	people	to	strengthen	their	self-restraint	by	observing	the	penitential seasons,	especially	Lent;	by	fasting	or	by	abstaining	from	flesh	meat	at	other times,	if	necessary	by	abstaining	from	alcohol;	and	by	seeking	that	supernatural help	which	comes	to	those	who	receive	the	Sacraments	worthily.	When	all	other deterrents	fail,	it	is	lawful,	according	to	the	teaching	of	the	Church,	for	married people	to	limit	intercourse	to	the	mid-menstrual	period,	when,	although conception	may	occur,	it	is	less	likely	to	occur	than	at	other	times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	other	methods	are	absolutely	and	without	exception	forbidden.	This	limited use	of	marriage,	which,	as	we	have	seen,	is	within	the	rights	of	the	married, differs	from	all	methods	of	artificial	birth-control	as	day	differs	from	night, because:	[Reference:	Explanation]</p>
<p class="calibre1">(1)	No	positive	or	direct	obstacle	is	used	against	procreation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(2)	The	intercourse	is	natural,	in	contradistinction	to	what	is	equivalent	to	self-abuse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(3)	Self-restraint	is	practised	in	that	the	intercourse	is	limited	to	certain	times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(4)	There	is	no	risk	to	mental	or	physical	health. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(5)	There	is	no	evil	will	to	 <i class="calibre4">defeat</i>	the	course	of	nature;	at	worst	there	is	merely	an</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a>absence	of	heroism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	if	the	question	be	considered	solely	as	a	matter	of	physiology	the difference	between	these	methods	is	apparent.	Physiologists	and	gynaecologists believe	that	in	natural	intercourse	there	is,	apart	from	fertilisation,	an	absorption of	certain	substances	into	the	system	of	the	woman.	The	r�le	of	this	absorption is	at	present	obscure,	but	it	obviously	exists	for	a	purpose;	and	it	is	permissible to	speculate	whether,	under	natural	conditions	of	intercourse,	there	is	not	a mutual	biological	reaction	that	makes,	amongst	other	things,	for	physical compatibility.	Whatever	be	its	purpose	or	explanation	in	the	marvellous mechanism	of	nature,	this	absorption	of	vital	substances	is	either	hindered	or	is absolutely	prevented	by	artificial	methods	of	birth	control;	whereas,	in	the method	permitted	by	the	teaching	of	the	Catholic	Church	there	is	no	interference with	a	physiological	process.	Even	those	who	fail,	from	their	lack	of	training,	to comprehend	moral	distinctions	in	this	matter	should	be	able	to	appreciate	the difference	between	a	method	that	is	physiological	and	one	that	is unphysiological. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	are	thousands	who	know	little	of	the	Catholic	or	of	any	other	faith,	and thousands	who	believe	the	Catholic	Church	to	be	everything	except	what	it	is. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These	people	have	no	infallible	rule	of	faith	and	morals,	and	when	confronted,	as they	now	are,	by	a	dangerous,	insidious	campaign	in	favour	of	birth	control,	they do	not	react	consistently	or	at	all.	It	was	therefore	thought	advisable	to	issue	this statement	in	defence	of	the	position	of	the	Catholic	Church;	but	the	reader should	remember	that	the	teaching	of	the	Church	on	this	matter	is	held	by	her members	to	be	true,	not	merely	because	it	agrees	with	the	notions	of	all	right-thinking	men	and	women,	not	because	it	is	in	harmony	with	economic, statistical,	social,	and	biological	truth,	but	principally	because	they	know	this teaching	to	be	an	authoritative	declaration	of	the	law	of	God.	The	Ten Commandments	have	their	pragmatic	justification;	they	make	for	the	good	of	the race;	but	the	Christian	obeys	them	as	expressions	of	the	Divine	Will. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Section	5.	CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	declining	birthrate	is	a	fact	of	the	utmost	gravity,	and	a	more	serious position	has	never	confronted	the	British	people.	Here	in	the	midst	of	a	great nation,	at	the	end	of	a	victorious	war,	the	law	of	decline	is	working,	and	by	that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a>law	the	greatest	empires	in	the	world	have	perished.	In	comparison	with	that single	fact	all	other	dangers,	be	they	of	war,	of	politics,	or	of	disease,	are	of	little moment.	Attempts	have	already	been	made	to	avert	the	consequences	by	the partial	endowment	of	motherhood	and	by	a	saving	of	infant	life.	Physiologists are	now	seeking	among	the	endocrinous	glands	and	the	vitamines	for	a	substance to	assist	procreation.	“Where	are	my	children?”	was	the	question	shouted yesterday	from	the	cinemas.	“Let	us	have	children,	children	at	any	price,”	will	be the	cry	of	to-morrow.	And	all	these	thoughts	were	once	in	the	mind	of	Augustus, Emperor	of	the	world	from	the	Atlantic	to	the	Euphrates,	from	Mount	Atlas	to the	Danube	and	the	Rhine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Catholic	Church	has	never	taught	that	“an	avalanche	of	children”	should	be brought	into	the	world	regardless	of	consequences.	God	is	not	mocked;	as	men sow,	so	shall	they	reap,	and	against	a	law	of	nature	both	the	transient amelioration	wrought	by	philanthropists	and	the	subtle	expediences	of	scientific politicians	are	alike	futile.	If	our	civilisation	is	to	survive	we	must	abandon	those ideals	that	lead	to	decline.	There	is	only	one	civilisation	immune	from	decay,	and that	civilisation	endures	on	the	practical	eugenics	once	taught	by	a	united Christendom	and	now	expounded	almost	solely	by	the	Catholic	Church. </p>
