<p id="id_Toc435357619" class="block_37">JanWoo-Corriboo Knows Things</p>
	<p class="block_39">The afternoon sun was warm and a dry wind rustled the cottonwood leaves as Helga strode through the bustling crowd to fill her plate again. But she soon stopped. The WooSheep were packed so tightly around the serving tables that Helga saw little hope of getting close soon.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Hmm, this might take us a little while,” she said aloud, thinking that Burwell was at her elbow as he had been earlier.</p>
	<p class="block_39">A different, strange voice answered instead. “A little while? Well, at least it isn’t one of those huge monster ‘whiles’ that eat small children for breakfast!”</p>
	<p class="block_39">Helga, startled by the strange answer, whirled around to see who had spoken. There were Burwell and Bwellina standing with bemused looks, and next to them a young female Fox dressed in khaki-colored shirt and breeches. Slightly built, and delicately-boned, the Fox appeared lithe and athletic. The reddish-blonde hair on her head was braided in rows of small cornrow braids running out from under the floppy cap she wore. Her eyes darted actively as she gazed at Helga through broad-lensed eyeglasses with wire frames.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“JanWoo-Corriboo, and pleased to meet you, I’m sure!” the Fox said, speaking so rapidly the Helga could hardly keep up. Moving constantly, pulsating with some internal rhythmic beat, she continued, “You’re looking for the ‘Mountain That Moves But Stands Still’ I hear.” JanWoo-Corriboo paused, looking at Helga, then concluded simply, “I know where it is.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">Helga’s eyes widened in surprise and then she looked seriously at the strange young Fox. “You do? Where is it?” she asked with cautious excitement.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“JanWoo-Corriboo knows a few things,” she replied mysteriously. “She knows the hills and canyons all around. She knows the names of the Ancient Ones whose remains lie in the Bone Forest. She knows the story of the WooSheep. She knows how to make hot chocolate and brownies...” She stopped and grinned at Helga. “And she knows about the ‘Mountain That Moves But Stands Still.’”</p>
	<p class="block_39">JanWoo-Corriboo was a prodigy. Barely eleven years-old, she was a brilliant explorer and prospector in the lands around WooSheep Bottoms. “The Bottoms are boring,” she said, with a snort. “Too comfortable. Too nicey-wicey. Too safe. Not enough danger and adventure. I like Rattlesnakes myself,” she said, noticeably twisting a necklace she was wearing. “This is made from the rattles of a twelve-foot-long Rattler I wrestled last summer,” she explained. “I didn’t hurt the poor old fellow, but he did lose a bet I made with him. I bet him his rattles that I could beat him at wrestling. I won. That’s the sort of thing I like.” She grinned at her new friends.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“I’m not too partial to Rattlesnakes, especially big ones! Yep! Yep! Yep!” Burwell stammered. “How about you all go right ahead and tramp around with the Rattlesnakes and I’ll stay here and enjoy the nicey-wicey, boring ol’ Bottoms?” They all roared with laughter as Burwell spoke with a quaver in his voice. Helga knew that Burwell was a brave and reliable friend. The old Bayou Dog would be at her side whenever she was in danger.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“But, Burwell,” Helga said, looking surprised, “I thought you were the one who wanted to see the Ancient Ones! I’ll bet JanWoo-Corriboo can take you to the best places.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Yes, that’s all well and good,” Burwell replied, “but I just don’t want to join the Ancient Ones!”</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Not to worry,” JanWoo-Corriboo commented. “Where we’re going, there will be plenty of adventure without any Rattlesnakes!”</p>
	<p class="block_39">Burwell looked soberly at Helga. “Uh, Helga, do you think that’s good news, or bad news?” he asked.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“It’s neither,” JanWoo-Corriboo was quick to reply, “whether it’s good news or bad news depends on what we find. That’s the adventure part that I like!”</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Ohhhh...I’m not going to like this!” Burwell sighed.</p>
	<p class="block_39">The three friends learned a great deal about the WooSheep that afternoon as they planned their trip to find the ‘Mountain That Moves But Stands Still.’</p>
	<p class="block_39">JanWoo-Corriboo told them that the WooSheep had lived in the Bottoms for untold generations. The WooSheep were descendents of refugees escaping from another group of WooSheep that lived deep underground in caves.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“The other WooSheep claim to be the only WooSheep,” she said, shaking her head. “They don’t acknowledge that we even exist! The first stories of our folk tell of a great whirlpool in the far off mountains that sucked all things in its power into underground caves. That was the origin of the first WooSheep. Finding themselves unable to escape, the early WooSheep learned to survive underground and made a life for themselves there. They still searched for a way out, but gradually became more and more content with their lot. As the years went by, the WooSheep society became increasingly close-minded. A few brave and free-thinking WooSheep managed to find a passage out of the caves—through the ‘Mountain That Moves But Stands Still’—and they tried to get the other WooSheep to follow them out. But the traditions of the ‘WooPeace’ as they called it were, by then, too strong. No one would listen.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">Helga and her friends were amazed. “There are WooSheep living below the ground?” Helga asked incredulously. “How can that be possible?” </p>
	<p class="block_39">“Oh, you can live there, all right,” JanWoo-Corriboo responded. “There is plenty of fresh water because the big river up in the mountains flows through there. There are fish, crawdads, frogs, and salamanders to eat, and they have bred flightless birds for eggs and feathers and long-haired mice that they shear to make wool for cloth. They are quite self-sufficient.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Isn’t there any contact between the WooSheep in the Bottoms and those that live underground?” Helga asked. “Don’t you communicate, at least?”</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Not in the least!” JanWoo-Corriboo said fiercely. “They are lost souls...fools who allow their WooZans to rule over them like tyrants! They get what they deserve. Once in a while, some beast will find an escape route and reach the Bottoms. We welcome these refugees, but beyond this we don’t care what the WooSheep underground do. We do not exist to them, and they do not exist to us!”</p>
	<p class="block_39">Helga’s head was spinning. It was too astonishing to comprehend.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“O.K...Well, let’s see...” Helga looked at Burwell in bewilderment. For once, Helga was speechless.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“What about the ‘Mountain That Moves But Stands Still?’” he asked. “Where is it and why does it have such a strange name?”</p>
	<p class="block_39">JanWoo-Corriboo was silent. Thinking that perhaps she had not heard him, Burwell repeated the question. “Where is the ‘Mountain That Moves But Stands Still’?”</p>
	<p class="block_39">“I cannot tell you,” JanWoo-Corriboo said.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“What?” Burwell said. “But you said you know where it is!”</p>
	<p class="block_39">“I do know where it is,” JanWoo-Corriboo replied, “but I can’t tell you where it is—it is the WooSheep law that no one talks about it. All contact with the WooPeace clan is forbidden. They are a dead people to us. And besides, they have Venom Bats guarding the entrance to the ‘Mountain That Moves But Stands Still.’ No one goes there, it is too dangerous.” JanWoo-Corriboo smiled happily, as if she were excited about something. </p>
	<p class="block_39">Burwell, Bwellina, and Helga looked at one another. They knew why she was excited. “And that’s exactly why you’re so happy and excited to take us there!” Burwell sighed, looking at JanWoo-Corriboo. She smiled back, nodding her head happily.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Ohhh...Woe is us!” Burwell moaned. “No Rattlesnakes, but now we’ve got Venom Bats. What an improvement! Yep! Yep! Yep!”</p>
	<p class="block_45"> </p>
