<p id="id_Toc435357613" class="block_37">In the Path of the Gateless Wolf</p>
	<p class="block_39">Ola paddled skillfully through some of the most tangled parts of the Drownlands swamps. Weaving his canoe in and out among the enormous trees, following an endless maze of bayous, Ola confused his pursuers and soon felt certain that King Stuppy’s thugs were hopelessly lost somewhere to his rear. Despite feeling safe, Ola paddled on and on, at last heading into the Everlost region of the Drownlands—a trackless area of thick reed forests. Thin, resiliant reeds towered eight to twelve feet above the surface of the water. Flexible and light, the grasslike reeds moved in the breeze like waves. Ola loved the Everlost because of the great enigma it represented. “Now, if yorn be’in Ever Lost, the creature must o’known he’s not lost at least once, or he wouldn’t know he be’in lost!” </p>
	<p class="block_39">But Ola also knew the Everlost was a dangerous place. With no solid ground or trees to be found, a creature had to stay in a boat. But in the boat, nothing could be seen except gently waving reeds on all sides. In places, the reeds were so tall and dense that they obscured most of the sky, leaving the traveler to ‘burrow’ through the reeds in a canoe. Ola freely went in and out of the Everlost, relying on the power of Enigma: “If yor be’in in the Everlost, follow the way of those that not be’in lost! Follow those on the way to somewhere!”</p>
	<p class="block_39">Ola listened and observed the signs of flocks of birds overhead. The patterns of flight that he could glimpse through the reeds and the sound of the bird calls gave him a direction to follow. “The birds know where they be go’in,” Ola thought, “so I can go the same place they be go’in.” By such a method Ola always successfully traversed the Everlost, although he never knew exactly where he would come out! But, being a Gateless Wolf, Ola typically did not care where he ended up. It was an adventure to explore new places. Living in his canoe for as long as it took to leave the Everlost behind, Ola did not mind the slowness of this progress through the reeds. There were plenty of fish and fresh water to sustain him until he found his way.</p>
	<p class="block_39">When he at last did emerge from the Everlost, he was in unfamiliar terrain. He saw rolling grassy hills before him, mottled here and there with small fields of corn and vegetables. Pulling his canoe up on dry land for the first time in several days, Ola slowly worked the cramps of the long confinement in his canoe out of his legs, arms, and back. Spying a tall oak tree nearby, he took his flute pouch and headed off to hang by his feet and play his flute for a while. It was that time of the day when the sun is just beginning to set. Ola planned to hang and play his flute until just before dark and then make a simple camp for the night.</p>
	<p class="block_39">He had just climbed the tree and was stepping out on a branch to get settled into position, when he saw something off in the distance that startled him. A large male Wood Cow was working in a corn field! Could it be Breister? Ola was so overjoyed at the possibility that he dropped from the tree clumsily and ran off to investigate.</p>
	<p class="block_39">As he approached the muscular creature busily hoeing weeds, he could see that he was definitely dressed in a manner and style similar to Helga. Clearly, he was of the same clan. Grinning widely, Ola called out, “Yor be’in Breister? Yor know’in a Wood Cow named Helgy?”</p>
	<p class="block_39">Dropping his hoe, the beast ran to meet Ola. “Breister? Helga? Do you know such creatures, friend? Have you seen them?”</p>
	<p class="block_39">Disappointed that the Wood Cow obviously was not Helga’s lost father, Ola still retained his happy smile. At least the stranger seemed to know who Breister and Helga were.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Who yor be’in?” Ola asked. “Yor be’in a friend of Breister and Helgy?”</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Aye, my friend,” his new acquaintance answered. “My name is Emil. If you are talking about Helga of the Hedgelands, then that is a Wood Cow I know. She is my sister.” </p>
	<p class="block_39">“Breister’s son!” Another member of Helga’s family! Perhaps he might know how to locate Breister. </p>
	<p class="block_39">Unfortunately, however, Emil had no news about Breister. In fact, Ola knew more about Breister and Helga than Emil did. Emil had not heard the news of the expulsion of the Wood Cows. After he had escaped from <i class="calibre7">Maev Astuté,</i> he had been completely unable to steer the balloon and traveled far beyond the Hedgelands. </p>
	<p class="block_39">“I tried desperately to pilot the balloon,” Emil explained, “but I had no time to learn. When I jumped on the bicycle in the High One’s Throne Room, I had no idea it was a launch vehicle! The launch completely surprised me, and with my Coyote friend draped over my shoulders, I could not handle the controls. I attempted to direct the balloon, but failed.” </p>
	<p class="block_39">Emil shook his head in disbelief as the memory of the balloon launch came back. “The wind was ferocious. It threw the balloon wildly this way and that. All I could do was keep us from being tossed overboard! Although I felt nauseous, I did manage to accidentally flip a lever that popped open an enclosure to form a passenger basket around the bicycle. With that small shelter available, we both collapsed in the bottom of the basket and rode the winds. It was very cold. The basket enclosure was fairly well closed at the top, but at the bottom there were so many gears, wheels, and other machinery that it was quite open. I had no idea where we were carried. Low-hanging clouds made it impossible to see the ground, and we sailed far past the limits of the Forever End. The balloon traveled on far into the night, in what direction I could not guess.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Yor came down near’s about, I take it?” Ola inquired.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Aye, the balloon landed not far from here,” Emil replied. “I tell you, Ola, that balloon just suddenly dropped like a rock! A seam split open. We were fortunate that the split was relatively small. We dropped rapidly, but the balloon lost gas slowly enough that, although we crashed hard, we were not badly hurt.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Yorn Coyote friend is here?” Ola asked.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Aye,” Emil answered. “His name is PorNart-1604. He’s with me at Mar-Marie and Ord’s house.” Noting Ola’s quizzical look, Emil continued. “Mar-Marie and Ord are Norder Wolves who live with their four daughters and three sons in a house just on the other side of this cornfield.  </p>
	<p class="block_39">“Norder Wolves!” Ola exclaimed. “Here?”</p>
	<p class="block_39">Emil looked at Ola with a pitying look. “And just exactly where do you think ‘Here’ might be?”</p>
	<p class="block_39">Ola did not reply. He realized that he could not be sure where he was, but he was very surprised to find Norder Wolves. His wide wanderings in the wilderness gave him a broad understanding of where the homelands of different folk lay, and what patterns of movement different adventurers, traders, and rogues tended to follow. Norder Wolves near the Everlost? He had never heard that. He was puzzled. Then he realized the problem. “Enigma!” he breathed softly to himself. “The more a creature be’in sure he knows stoof, the more likely it be’in that he don’t know it all.” Drawing on the power of Enigma, Ola regained his composure. He was ready to meet the Norder Wolves.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Come on, Ola,” Emil invited, “I’ll introduce you to Mar-Marie and Ord.” Picking up his hoe, Emil motioned for Ola to follow. As they walked around the cornfield, Emil related more of his story.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“See that low hill right over there? That’s where the balloon crashed. When we came down, it wasn’t easy for us. PorNart-1604 was in terrible shape—frostbite, maybe some broken bones, shallow breathing. I was very worried. But from the hillside, I could see the faint light of the farmhouse and felt hope. Although very weak and exhausted, I picked up PorNart-1604 and carried him to the farmhouse. When we reached it, I managed to knock once. When Ord opened the door, I toppled over into the house. Mar-Marie nursed me and the Coyote back to health.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">Ola was fascinated by the story. His mind raced. Norder Wolves were distant ancestors of Ola’s folk. So, there was some special interest in his anticipation of meeting Mar-Marie and Ord.</p>
	<p class="block_39">As they approached the farmhouse, Ola could see a heavy set female Wolf in a plaid apron sweeping the dirt path in front of the house.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Hullo! Mar, we’ve got a visitor! Call Ord! It’s a friend of my sister!” </p>
	<p class="block_39">Mar-Marie stopped her sweeping and looked curiously at Ola. She, too, was apparently surprised to meet another Wolf. She gave a warm and welcoming smile.</p>
	<p class="block_39">The beautiful weather, warm and mild, and the bright red and green plaid Mar-Marie wore made the welcome seem especially lovely to Ola. </p>
	<p class="block_39">“Nar, sweets! Just hold there a moment,” Mar-Marie greeted them. “The dust is deep in the path. It’s not fitting as a welcome. Hold just there a moment, while I finish my sweeping.” The female Wolf swept the dirt path furiously, setting up great clouds of dust, stripping off every speck of dust that could be removed. </p>
	<p class="block_39">When she stopped sweeping at last, she smiled again at her visitors. “So sorry, sweets, but you caught me in my evening sun-making. I dare not delay it,” she said, as if they would certainly understand. “Nar, sweets, forgive me a bit more, if you would. Stay there while I get Ord and bring you some water to drink.” As friendly as the Wolf’s welcome had been, she still made it clear they were not to approach the house yet.</p>
	<p class="block_39">Ola looked to Emil questioningly. Emil, understanding Ola’s bewilderment, grinned at him. “Aye, it seems odd, does it not?” he remarked. “But there’s a beautiful reason that we are asked to respect.” </p>
	<p class="block_39">Soon, Mar-Marie returned with a crockery pitcher of water and cups. She offered some to Ola and Emil. “If you’ll be so kind as to sit over there while you drink your water, I’ll finish up my sun-making in a stitch. Ord is down in the root cellar doing some work. Now, if you’ll just excuse me a bit, I’ll finish up and we can welcome you proper.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">Carrying the pitcher and cups over to a bench Mar-Marie had indicated, Ola and Emil sat down to wait. Ola noticed that the Wolf was now sprinkling the area she had swept with water, making it damp but not muddy. Then she came back with her broom and swept the sprinkled area furiously. Ola had never seen such a thing. </p>
	<p class="block_39">“It’s a kind of ritual that Mar does every day just at sunset,” Emil explained. “She calls it sun-making. She believes that if she does not leave the path in front of her house spotless and easy to travel in the dark each day, that the sun will not be able to find its way to her door...Mar says that the new day will not come if her path is not clean and easy to walk in the dark.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">Ola gave Emil a broad smile. He liked Mar already! She understood the power of Enigma! “Emil, Mar be’in a wise creature. Yor find’in the brightest light only by clean’in the places that can’t be cleaned! Yor mak’in a path in the dark for the brightest light!” Emil, still not fully acquainted with Ola, gave his new friend an appreciative, but uncertain look.</p>
	<p class="block_39">When Mar-Marie had finished sweeping, the path in front of her house was extremely smooth; the dirt surface hard-packed and clean. Without a doubt, Ola could see that the stretch of path going past Mar-Marie’s house clearly stood out from the rest of the path. He found it hard to imagine the sun walking along in the dark and needing a special surface to find its way, but he respected the belief of his host. If nothing else, her efforts did make the path beautiful and easy to walk. And who really knew what made the sun rise? He certainly didn’t. Maybe she was right!</p>
	<p class="block_39">“So, come on into our house, sweets,” Mar-Marie invited. “You’ve found a lost traveler, I see, Emil?” she said, looking at Ola.</p>
	<p class="block_39">Walking into the house, Ola saw a male Wolf, dressed in rough dark clothes; like legends Ola had once heard of voyagers on the distant seas. The Wolf had long ashes-gray hair. Ola judged that he was perhaps forty years old, similar to what he guessed Mar’s age to be. The Wolf was heavy set, like his wife. Although his rough coat bulged with a bit of a paunch, he was nevertheless strongly muscular, with thick arms, broad shoulders, and clear eyes circled by wizened rings. </p>
	<p class="block_39">“Ord,” Mar-Marie said to the Wolf as he ascended the last stair or two out of what was apparently a cellar under the house, “you must leave your work and welcome a new friend.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">The Wolf walked quickly over to Ola, holding out both his paws to him. “Greetings, take peace in our humble house,” he said, grasping Ola’s paw in both of his own in a warm pawclasp. “What business brings you?” he asked. </p>
	<p class="block_39">“My business?” Ola repeated, pausing. “I am a Gateless Wolf, a follower of the path of Enigma.” </p>
	<p class="block_39">“Seeing your outfit, there’s no question what you are,” Ord replied. “We’re well-acquainted with the path of the Gateless Wolf. But what’s your business?” </p>
	<p class="block_39">“I be’in a wanderer in search o’ the lost and trooubled,” Ola answered. “I roam the wilds hop’in to find travelers need’in help. I be’in in yorn lands in service to a missing Wood Cow, late of the Hedgelands, family of Emil, and now unknown.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">A shadow passed briefly across Ord’s happy face. “This Wood Cow—the Hedgelands, you say? There’s many a missing beast that’s n’er seen again in the Hedgelands,” he said, looking grim. “You came out of the Everlost,” Ord observed, “that means you’re likely either escaping from someone, or hunting someone. No one goes into the Everlost on a lark. So, what’s your business?” Ord’s words were now cool and hard.</p>
	<p class="block_39">Ola was confused. “Why, I be’in a wander’in beast, no moore, no less. A help’in creature. I be only escap’in King Stuppy’s rouges and cutthroats. Why do yor welcome a stranger with such questions? Yorn own good beast sense knows well that what I say be’in true.” Ola suddenly leaped up and swung into the rough-hewn rafters of the farmhouse. Hanging by his feet he looked at Ord with twinkling eyes. “If yor need’in more proouf that I be’in a true Gateless Wolf, I’ll just be’in play’in yor a tune on my flute,” Ola said, putting this flute to his lips.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Now, you're a feisty one,” Ord returned, shaking his head with a renewed affection. “I'm glad you’re full of spirit, a feisty one! But don’t hold it hard against me...I had to test you. We’d be sorry later if you weren’t what you say.” Then, to Ola’s astonishment, Ord himself swung up onto the rafter and hung by his feet too!</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Yor be’in a Gateless Wolf!” Ola exclaimed. “No other creature knows how to be hang’in like that.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">“And what did you think?” Ord replied. “Did you imagine that all the Gateless Wolves are wandering youngsters like yourself?”</p>
	<p class="block_39">There was no need to say more. Ola and Ord both dropped to the floor and embraced like long-lost brothers. Pulling up chairs before the fire, they fell into animated conversation. Talking far into the night, they barely stopped for the dinner that Mar-Marie and Emil prepared.</p>
	<p class="block_39">Emil listened with interest as he and Mar worked on the other side of the room. Much of the talk bore no special interest for him. But a change in his manner of disinterested attention occurred when Ord explained how he and Mar had chosen to settle in the remote unsettled lands along the crest of the Everlost.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“We are pioneers of a sort,” Ord said. “Mar and I made our homestead here nearly thirty years ago. I grew up in a clan of sea-faring Norder Wolves, and for a long time the wanderlust of that life carried me along. I sailed for some years as a young rip,” he continued. “But later I grew tired of the sea, and followed the Gateless Wolf path. Although I loved the practice of Enigma and the rest of the Gateless Wolf ways, the lonely life of wandering from place to place did not satisfy me. I could not ignore the promptings of my heart that something was missing. Especially when I first laid eyes on Mar-Marie! Seeing her made me feel like the Gateless Wolf life would be so much more wonderful if she would go along with me. So, I asked her to take to the Gateless Wolf path with me.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Yor did what?” Ola exclaimed. “Yor asked Mar to take to the Gateless Wolf ways?” Ola’s head was spinning. Such a thing had never been heard of before. A female following the way of the Gateless Wolf? </p>
	<p class="block_39">Seeing that Ola was speechless, Ord continued. “Calm yourself, Ola,” he said. “Keep listening! If you wonder at what I did, I hope you see how it might be possible to be even stronger on the path, even though I have left the path.” Ord paused, looking fondly at Ola, as if waiting for something.</p>
	<p class="block_39">Ola looked puzzled for a moment, then exploded: “Enigma!” he laughed. “Yor an old Gateless Wolf still!” Ola cried. </p>
	<p class="block_39">Ord told Ola that Mar-Marie had said that the Gateless Wolf path was not for her. “She said that the Gateless Wolf life was fine for me, but she wanted to do something that helped more folk than one traveler here or there.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Now, don’t get me wrong,” Mar chimed in from where she and Emil were preparing dinner, “What I actually told him was that wandering around helping creatures you happen to stumble over is fine, but what I wanted was to help the masses of creatures you know are in trouble without waiting to stumble over them!”</p>
	<p class="block_39">“And how are yor do’in that?” Ola asked.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“We’ve been farming here all these years,” Mar replied. “We’re about the only creatures out in this land, but a few other pioneers are beginning to come.” </p>
	<p class="block_39">“I’m glad to hear it,” Ola responded.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Oh, don’t be too glad of it,” Ord said. “Our whole service to the Gateless Wolf path depends on not too many people being around. We’d rather not have too many neighbors!”</p>
	<p class="block_39">“How does farm’in—here all by yorn lonesome—follow the Gateless Wolf path?” Ola asked.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Well,” Ord replied slowly, looking to Mar to see how far he should go in his explanation. Seeing her nod, he went on, “Well, you see, Ola, we help slaves escape from the Hedgelands!”</p>
	<p class="block_39">“How?” Ola asked in astonishment.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Ah! Well, that’s a long story,” Ord replied. “The sort of story where you end up hanging on the gallows if you happen to tell the wrong person.” He sipped some hot tea that Emil had poured for him, got up, and stood at the side of the fire, with his heavy paw on the mantel.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Could I make a guess, I wonder?” Ola asked. Ord allowed as how Ola could guess all he wanted.</p>
	<p class="block_39">With his heart beating rapidly, Ola rose out of his chair, and walked over to where Mar-Marie’s broom rested in the corner of the room. Holding the broom like he had seen Mar do when she swept the path in front of their house, Ola began sweeping as he had seen Mar do earlier.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Say, for instance,” Ola said slowly, as he continued the sweeping motion, “that a group of escaped slaves happen’in to be pass’in down yorn path under cover of darkness. Say they carry’in no lamps for fear of call’in eyes upon them. Say they are stumbl’in along in the dark and need’in a place of refuge. Say they find an unusually clean and smooth place in the path.” Ola paused, looking from Ord to Mar with excitement in his eyes. “Say that such an unusually clean and smooth spot in the path is a signal that yorn house is a safe-house for those same escaped slaves!”</p>
	<p class="block_39">Electrified looks passed between each person in the room. Ord smiled. “Well done, Ola!” he said. “You are now eligible to swing on the gallows with the rest of us.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Well, some honors depend on the company,” Ola laughed.  </p>
	<p class="block_39">“Yes, Ola, dear friend, we’ve made a way for crowds of troubled creatures to find their way to safety. This is our lifework in the path of the Gateless Wolf!” Again he took both Ola’s paws in his own. Mar-Marie and Emil came over and joined with Ola and Ord. Ola’s eyes filled with tears as he realized the extreme danger these dear friends were surely in each day.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Don’t you mind us, Ola,” Ord said, sensing his concern. “We’ve carried on these thirty years by ourselves and will carry on as long as we can. Don’t fear for us.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Is there no one else?” Ola asked.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Oh, there be others, all right,” Mar replied. “But it’s that line we will not cross with you tonight. Too many count on our silence about them. We trust you completely,” Mar continued, “but even the most trusted of us make mistakes. The more people, the more possibility of mistake. We cannot risk it with you. At least not yet.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">A new thought suddenly occurred to Ola. The Coyote was missing. He had not seen a sign of PorNart-1604 or any of Mar and Ord’s children since he had arrived. “I thought yor had a Coyote guest,” Ola commented, “and some reputed children as well.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">No one responded to the question, so Ola answered his own question. “Yorn don’t really have all those children. Those are yorn helpers. Creatures who lead the escapees along to freedom. PorNart-1604 is one of them.” Ola looked to Ord and Mar for confirmation.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Close to the mark, Ola, but wide of the heart of the matter,” Mar smiled. “We do have children, but they are all grown. We are not young anymore. Yes, some lead those escaping to safety. Some have other reasons to be gone just now. Some live elsewhere. PorNart-1604 is not an escaped slave. Emil no doubt told you how he came to be here.” Mar paused, looking fondly at Ord. “We’re better people than when we came here. We’re better because of the creatures that have visited. We learn from each of them. PorNart-1604 is rebuilding the balloon. He thinks he can repair it and improve it. We hope to use it to carry on our work!”</p>
	<p class="block_39">“How do you mean?” Ola asked.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Well, let’s just say it’s a very long walk from the Hedgelands,” Ord said with a wink. “PorNart-1604 is up in the hills for a time. He’s building a workshop and forge to make new parts.” Mar put a finger to her husband’s lips. </p>
	<p class="block_39">“No more just now, Ord. We’ve trusted this new friend with a great deal tonight. Let us see how it goes on for a while. Caution is necessary.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">So saying, the talk on this subject ended for the night, with conversation moving on to happier topics. All told jokes and laughed until their jaws hurt. Gradually the night slipped away. Ola was thoughtful. He resolved to stay with Mar and Ord for a time to see what other new things he might learn.</p>
