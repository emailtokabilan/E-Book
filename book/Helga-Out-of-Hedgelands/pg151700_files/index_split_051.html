<p id="id_Toc435357626" class="block_37">A Parting of Ways</p>
	<p class="block_39">When the travelers arrived, dusty and road weary, at the Cutoff station, they moved quickly toward bed. They hoped to get an early start the next day. As the three friends unloaded their bags, Breister talked pleasantly for a few minutes with Zeke, the station-master, telling him a bit about his travels. A few days later, Zeke, in turn, would entertain a Bayou Dog named Burwell with his stories about the strange trio he had met. But, as he drifted off to sleep, all Breister knew was that he felt a growing sense that he was, at last, somehow close to Helga’s trail.</p>
	<p class="block_39">Breister, Annie, and Toshty set out early the next morning in the bladder canoe. “We paddle for several days through the backwaters of the Drownlands,” Toshty explained, “then we travel for a few days up a stream that runs into WooSheep Bottoms. From there, it’s just a short hike to my cabin.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">The next several days brought a closer sense of friendship among the travelers. Something wonderful had happened to break through the icy loneliness that had long sent Toshty and Annie off on their isolated paths. Breister, for his part, felt a sense of relief and comfort to feel that he could trust these friends. Together, they were all happier and stronger than any of them had been apart.</p>
	<p class="block_39">On the fourth day of their voyage up the creek toward WooSheep Bottoms, Breister sensed that Annie was agitated. Toshty, too, seemed ill at ease. Something was up, Breister knew, but his friends were not saying what was bothering them.</p>
	<p class="block_39">The next morning, Breister was roasting some fresh frog legs on a spit for their breakfast, when Annie cleared her throat to get his attention. He looked up at her expectantly, continuing to turn the roasting spit over the campfire. </p>
	<p class="block_39">Annie smiled at him. She was holding Toshty’s wing in her paw. “Breister,” she began, “Toshty and I have something to tell you.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">Looking at the joy in the eyes of his friends, Breister felt that he did not really have to be told what they were going to say, but he replied, “I’m all ears. Go ahead.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">Annie pulled Toshty forward as she moved closed to Breister. “I’m not going any further with you, Breister.” He looked at her questioningly. “As you know, some of my past is not very pleasant. I’m not proud of that. I want to leave that behind me and start a new life. I know there are Grizzly Bear trackers all over the Bottoms looking for me. If I go to the Bottoms, my life will be over...” She stopped and looked at Toshty.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“I’ve asked Annie to marry me,” Toshty grinned. “And she seems to like crazy old Owls!” He hugged Annie’s shoulder with one of his wings. “So, we’re taking the long route back to the cabin,” Toshty said, with a look of contentment. “We’ll see you there later, perhaps, but don’t wait for us. We’re going back to the Rounds to get married first. Annie can’t go to WooSheep Bottoms, and we don’t want to go to the Drownlands or the WooPeace, so that leaves the Rounds.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">Breister nodded and smiled at his friends. “I wish you the best...in making your unbroken circle of friends stronger,” he said with a loving look at his happy companions. “Now, I just need to find the rest of my circle!”</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Don’t worry, Breister,” Toshty replied. “We’re not leaving you in the lurch! I can give you directions to my cabin. When you get there, make yourself at home...” He paused, looking embarrassed. “I actually need you to do something for me there,” he continued. “I have some art lessons scheduled for tomorrow. There will be a couple of Otters and a Fox who will come to the cabin expecting me to teach them to paint,” he laughed. “I’d be much obliged if you would be there to tell them that, well, uh,” he smiled at Annie, “that art lessons are postponed until further notice!”</p>
	<p class="block_39">Breister smiled, but felt a bit annoyed. His friends were leaving him. Not only that, but helping Toshty might delay his own search for Helga.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“And, Breister,” Toshty said, “the young Fox I mentioned—name’s JanWoo-Corriboo—she’s one of the most amazing young beasts you’ll ever meet. She can take you to the ‘Mountain That Moves But Stands Still’—you can trust her completely and she’s as brilliant as they come. You’ll be in good hands with her. If your Helga is anywhere to be found, JanWoo-Corriboo can help you find her.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">Breister’s annoyance evaporated. He was happy for his friends and felt confident of his path forward. If all was not yet well for him, he felt somehow that things were improving.</p>
	<p class="block_39">The three friends loaded their belongings back in the bladder canoe and set off again. “We’ll paddle with you a bit further toward the Bottoms,” Toshty said. “There’s a little sandspit that is covered with trees, bushes, and reeds. We’ll drop you off there. It’s not far from my cabin. Then we’ll paddle back to the Drownlands Cutoff to catch the running-wagon back to the Rounds. The next time you see us, we’ll be husband and wife.” Toshty beamed.</p>
	<p class="block_39">A few hours later, Toshty beached the canoe among some dense reeds. As Breister got out of the canoe, he was well concealed by vegetation. Only the faint rustle of leaves and the gurgling of the stream broke the silence. It was as if they were in a small pocket of life in a vast and barren land.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Don’t be fooled by what you see,” Toshty advised. “Just around that bend up ahead lies WooSheep Bottoms. Unless I miss my guess, you’ll start hearing the wild screams of young beasts at the swimming hole as soon as you get out of these trees. But don’t go to the swimming hole. Follow the directions I gave you. You’ll get to the cabin just fine.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">The friends enjoyed a last round of farewells. Then, Toshty and Annie paddled away. Breister watched their progress for a while until Toshty’s voice came wafting back across the water. “Tell JanWoo-Corriboo that I told her to show you the painting she calls <i class="calibre7">Eye Of The All</i>,” Toshty yelled. “She’ll know what I mean.” With that, the canoe floated around the bend and Breister was alone.</p>
	<p class="block_39">Breister sat watching the place where the canoe had disappeared. He half-expected Toshty and Annie to reappear. But, no, he didn’t really expect that at all. He just hoped with all his heart that this would not be the last time he would see his friends. Slowly, he reached down and picked up his pack. He took out a piece of Bison bread and, munching on it with a special pleasure coming from his growing connections with the Rounds, he walked away from the river.</p>
	<p class="block_39">He had not walked more than a few minutes, following the directions that Toshty had given him, when a large squad of Grizzly Bear trackers stepped out of the brush and surrounded him. Although Breister had nothing to fear from the trackers himself, his heart beat wildly. </p>
	<p class="block_39">Grizzly Bear trackers were specially trained officers of the law, whose task it was to track down the worst rogues and bandits and bring them to justice. They were renowned for their bravery and skill against the most dangerous desperadoes.</p>
	<p class="block_39">A particularly large Grizzly Bear, with part of his ear gone, and a long scar on his nose, stepped toward Breister. Showing his law badge, he growled, “Where ya been, and where ya goin’?”</p>
	<p class="block_39">“I’ve been in the Rounds and I’m on my way to see some friends near the Bottoms,” Breister replied. The Grizzly Bear looked him over closely, peering directly into his face, looking for any hint of dishonesty.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“What’s yer business, and who ya seen?” the Grizzly Bear growled again, fingering a long stout coil of rope that hung from his belt, next to a long Bowie knife. “We’re looking for some Cougar bandits that are in need of this rope,” the tracker snarled unpleasantly. “There’s two nasties that especially need this rope,” he continued. “One’s called Broken Eye, and the other’s Slasher Annie. They’s been terrorizing the innocents in the Bottoms. We tracked them up into the mountains and lost ’em...” The Grizzly Bear ran his finger along the scar on his nose. “This here’s the calling card of those dirtbags,” he declared angrily. “Ya seen anyone?”</p>
	<p class="block_39">“I hope you get that Broken Eye fellow,” Breister replied calmly. “I hope that scalawag gets just what he deserves,” Breister added. “He attacked me up in the mountains, so I’m glad to see you’re after him.” Breister felt happy. Maybe he could keep them away from the subject of Annie.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Who ya seen,” the Grizzly Bear repeated. He obviously was determined to be thorough.</p>
	<p class="block_39">“I saw an old Owl and his wife,” Breister replied simply. “That’s all I’ve seen in days.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">“An old Owl and his wife,” the Grizzly Bear repeated, looking intently at Breister. “Ya sure that’s all ya seen?”</p>
	<p class="block_39">“Yes,” Breister replied with conviction, “I can assure you that that is all I’ve seen—an old Owl and his wife.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">The Grizzly Bear reached into the pocket of his barkskin coat. He handed Breister a blue pebble. “This is our trackin’ stone,” he explained. “We leave it with ya. You see a sign of Broken Eye and his gang and you show that stone to any law officer and they’ll know that’s our team. They’ll know how to find us.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">Breister thanked them. “If I see that old scoundrel or his gang,” Breister assured the trackers, “I’ll use the tracking stone. You can be sure of that.”</p>
	<p class="block_39">Satisfied, the Grizzlies moved on. Breister walked on a few steps and prepared to leave the stream behind, as he turned inward toward Toshty’s cabin. “Well,” he said to himself looking at the tracking stone, “Broken Eye and his gang are no more. There’s no need for this.” Saying this, Breister skipped the blue stone out across the stream, where it sank to the bottom.</p>
	<p class="block_39">He continued on his way, reaching Toshty’s cabin in the middle of the afternoon. He made a cheerful fire in the hearth, ate a modest meal of Bison bread, and settled in to wait for Toshty’s students. He was especially looking forward to meeting JanWoo-Corriboo. Perhaps she could help him find Helga.</p>
