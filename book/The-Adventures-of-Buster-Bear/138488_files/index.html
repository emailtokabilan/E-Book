<p class="calibre1">Buster	Bear	yawned	as	he	lay	on	his	comfortable	bed	of	leaves	and	watched	the first	early	morning	sunbeams	creeping	through	the	Green	Forest	to	chase	out	the Black	 Shadows.	 Once	 more	 he	 yawned,	 and	 slowly	 got	 to	 his	 feet	 and	 shook himself.	 Then	 he	 walked	 over	 to	 a	 big	 pine-tree,	 stood	 up	 on	 his	 hind	 legs, reached	as	high	up	on	the	trunk	of	the	tree	as	he	could,	and	scratched	the	bark with	his	great	claws.	After	that	he	yawned	until	it	seemed	as	if	his	jaws	would crack,	and	then	sat	down	to	think	what	he	wanted	for	breakfast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	 he	 sat	 there,	 trying	 to	 make	 up	 his	 mind	 what	 would	 taste	 best,	 he	 was listening	to	the	sounds	that	told	of	the	waking	of	all	the	little	people	who	live	in the	 Green	 Forest.	 He	 heard	 Sammy	 Jay	 way	 off	 in	 the	 distance	 screaming, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thief!	Thief!"	and	grinned.	"I	wonder,"	thought	Buster,	"if	some	one	has	stolen Sammy's	breakfast,	or	if	he	has	stolen	the	breakfast	of	some	one	else.	Probably he	is	the	thief	himself." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	heard	Chatterer	the	Red	Squirrel	scolding	as	fast	as	he	could	make	his	tongue go	 and	 working	 himself	 into	 a	 terrible	 rage.	 "Must	 be	 that	 Chatterer	 got	 out	 of bed	the	wrong	way	this	morning,"	thought	he. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 heard	 Blacky	 the	 Crow	 cawing	 at	 the	 top	 of	 his	 lungs,	 and	 he	 knew	 by	 the sound	 that	 Blacky	 was	 getting	 into	 mischief	 of	 some	 kind.	 He	 heard	 the	 sweet voices	 of	 happy	 little	 singers,	 and	 they	 were	 good	 to	 hear.	 But	 most	 of	 all	 he listened	 to	 a	 merry,	 low,	 silvery	 laugh	 that	 never	 stopped	 but	 went	 on	 and	 on, until	he	just	felt	as	if	he	must	laugh	too.	It	was	the	voice	of	the	Laughing	Brook. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 as	 Buster	 listened	 it	 suddenly	 came	 to	 him	 just	 what	 he	 wanted	 for breakfast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	 going	 fishing,"	 said	 he	 in	 his	 deep	 grumbly-rumbly	 voice	 to	 no	 one	 in particular.	"Yes,	Sir,	I'm	going	fishing.	I	want	some	fat	trout	for	my	breakfast." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 shuffled	 along	 over	 to	 the	 Laughing	 Brook,	 and	 straight	 to	 a	 little	 pool	 of which	 he	 knew,	 and	 as	 he	 drew	 near	 he	 took	 the	 greatest	 care	 not	 to	 make	 the teeniest,	weeniest	bit	of	noise.	Now	it	just	happened	that	early	as	he	was,	some one	was	before	Buster	Bear.	When	he	came	in	sight	of	the	little	pool,	who	should</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>he	see	but	another	fisherman	there,	who	had	already	caught	a	fine	fat	trout.	Who was	it?	Why,	Little	Joe	Otter	to	be	sure.	He	was	just	climbing	up	the	bank	with the	fat	trout	in	his	mouth.	Buster	Bear's	own	mouth	watered	as	he	saw	it.	Little Joe	 sat	 down	 on	 the	 bank	 and	 prepared	 to	 enjoy	 his	 breakfast.	 He	 hadn't	 seen Buster	Bear,	and	he	didn't	know	that	he	or	any	one	else	was	anywhere	near. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Buster	 Bear	 tiptoed	 up	 very	 softly	 until	 he	 was	 right	 behind	 Little	 Joe	 Otter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Woof,	woof!"	said	he	in	his	deepest,	most	grumbly-rumbly	voice.	"That's	a	very fine	looking	trout.	I	wouldn't	mind	if	I	had	it	myself." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	 Joe	 Otter	 gave	 a	 frightened	 squeal	 and	 without	 even	 turning	 to	 see	 who was	 speaking	 dropped	 his	 fish	 and	 dived	 headfirst	 into	 the	 Laughing	 Brook. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Buster	Bear	sprang	forward	and	with	one	of	his	big	paws	caught	the	fat	trout	just as	it	was	slipping	back	into	the	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Here's	your	trout,	Mr.	Otter,"	said	he,	as	Little	Joe	put	his	head	out	of	water	to see	who	had	frightened	him	so.	"Come	and	get	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="#p6">Illus</a>	Here's	your	trout,	Mr.	Otter,	said	he	</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">Page	5. </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Little	Joe	wouldn't.	The	fact	is,	he	was	afraid	to.	He	snarled	at	Buster	Bear and	called	him	a	thief	and	everything	bad	he	could	think	of.	Buster	didn't	seem to	 mind.	 He	 chuckled	 as	 if	 he	 thought	 it	 all	 a	 great	 joke	 and	 repeated	 his invitation	 to	 Little	 Joe	 to	 come	 and	 get	 his	 fish.	 But	 Little	 Joe	 just	 turned	 his back	and	went	off	down	the	Laughing	Brook	in	a	great	rage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	too	bad	to	waste	such	a	fine	fish,"	said	Buster	thoughtfully.	"I	wonder	what I'd	 better	 do	 with	 it."	 And	 while	 he	 was	 wondering,	 he	 ate	 it	 all	 up.	 Then	 he started	down	the	Laughing	Brook	to	try	to	catch	some	for	himself. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a><b class="calibre3">II</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">LITTLE	JOE	OTTER	GETS	EVEN	WITH</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">BUSTER	BEAR</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Joe	Otter	was	in	a	terrible	rage.	It	was	a	bad	beginning	for	a	beautiful	day and	Little	Joe	knew	it.	But	who	wouldn't	be	in	a	rage	if	his	breakfast	was	taken from	him	just	as	he	was	about	to	eat	it?	Anyway,	that	is	what	Little	Joe	told	Billy Mink.	Perhaps	he	didn't	tell	it	quite	exactly	as	it	was,	but	you	know	he	was	very badly	frightened	at	the	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	was	sitting	on	the	bank	of	the	Laughing	Brook	beside	one	of	the	little	pools," </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	told	Billy	Mink,	"and	was	just	going	to	eat	a	fat	trout	I	had	caught,	when	who should	 come	 along	 but	 that	 great	 big	 bully,	 Buster	 Bear.	 He	 took	 that	 fat	 trout away	from	me	and	ate	it	just	as	if	it	belonged	to	him!	I	hate	him!	If	I	live	long enough	I'm	going	to	get	even	with	him!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	 course	 that	 wasn't	 nice	 talk	 and	 anything	 but	 a	 nice	 spirit,	 but	 Little	 Joe Otter's	temper	is	sometimes	pretty	short,	especially	when	he	is	hungry,	and	this time	he	had	had	no	breakfast,	you	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Buster	 Bear	 hadn't	 actually	 taken	 the	 fish	 away	 from	 Little	 Joe.	 But	 looking	 at the	matter	as	Little	Joe	did,	it	amounted	to	the	same	thing.	You	see,	Buster	knew perfectly	well	when	he	invited	Little	Joe	to	come	back	and	get	it	that	Little	Joe wouldn't	dare	do	anything	of	the	kind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where	is	he	now?"	asked	Billy	Mink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	somewhere	up	the	Laughing	Brook.	I	wish	he'd	fall	in	and	get	drowned!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">snapped	Little	Joe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Billy	Mink	just	had	to	laugh.	The	idea	of	great	big	Buster	Bear	getting	drowned in	the	Laughing	Brook	was	too	funny.	There	wasn't	water	enough	in	it	anywhere except	 down	 in	 the	 Smiling	 Pool,	 and	 that	 was	 on	 the	 Green	 Meadows,	 where Buster	had	never	been	known	to	go.	"Let's	go	see	what	he	is	doing,"	said	Billy Mink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	first	Little	Joe	didn't	want	to,	but	at	last	his	curiosity	got	the	better	of	his	fear, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>and	he	agreed.	So	the	two	little	brown-coated	scamps	turned	down	the	Laughing Brook,	taking	the	greatest	care	to	keep	out	of	sight	themselves.	They	had	gone only	a	little	way	when	Billy	Mink	whispered:	"Sh-h!	There	he	is." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sure	enough,	there	was	Buster	Bear	sitting	close	beside	a	little	pool	and	looking into	it	very	intently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's	he	doing?"	asked	Little	Joe	Otter,	as	Buster	Bear	sat	for	the	longest	time without	moving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	 then	 one	 of	 Buster's	 big	 paws	 went	 into	 the	 water	 as	 quick	 as	 a	 flash	 and scooped	out	a	trout	that	had	ventured	too	near. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	fishing!"	exclaimed	Billy	Mink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	that	is	just	what	Buster	Bear	was	doing,	and	it	was	very	plain	to	see	that	he was	 having	 great	 fun.	 When	 he	 had	 eaten	 the	 trout	 he	 had	 caught,	 he	 moved along	to	the	next	little	pool. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They	 are	  <i class="calibre4">our</i>	 fish!"	 said	 Little	 Joe	 fiercely.	 "He	 has	 no	 business	 catching	  <i class="calibre4">our</i> fish!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	see	how	we	are	going	to	stop	him,"	said	Billy	Mink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	do!"	cried	Little	Joe,	into	whose	head	an	idea	had	just	popped.	"I'm	going	to drive	all	the	fish	out	of	the	little	pools	and	muddy	the	water	all	up.	Then	we'll	see how	many	fish	he	will	get!	Just	you	watch	me	get	even	with	Buster	Bear." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Joe	slipped	swiftly	into	the	water	and	swam	straight	to	the	little	pool	that Buster	 Bear	 would	 try	 next.	 He	 frightened	 the	 fish	 so	 that	 they	 fled	 in	 every direction.	 Then	 he	 stirred	 up	 the	 mud	 until	 the	 water	 was	 so	 dirty	 that	 Buster couldn't	have	seen	a	fish	right	under	his	nose.	He	did	the	same	thing	in	the	next pool	and	the	next.	Buster	Bear's	fishing	was	spoiled	for	that	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="#p4">Contents</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a><b class="calibre3">III</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">BUSTER	BEAR	IS	GREATLY	PUZZLED</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Buster	Bear	hadn't	enjoyed	himself	so	much	since	he	came	to	the	Green	Forest	to live.	His	fun	began	when	he	surprised	Little	Joe	Otter	on	the	bank	of	a	little	pool in	 the	 Laughing	 Brook	 and	 Little	 Joe	 was	 so	 frightened	 that	 he	 dropped	 a	 fat trout	he	had	just	caught.	It	had	seemed	like	a	great	joke	to	Buster	Bear,	and	he had	 chuckled	 over	 it	 all	 the	 time	 he	 was	 eating	 the	 fat	 trout.	 When	 he	 had finished	it,	he	started	on	to	do	some	fishing	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Presently	he	came	to	another	little	pool.	He	stole	up	to	it	very,	very	softly,	so	as not	to	frighten	the	fish.	Then	he	sat	down	close	to	the	edge	of	it	and	didn't	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Buster	learned	a	long	time	ago	that	a	fisherman	must	be	patient	unless,	like	Little Joe	Otter,	he	is	just	as	much	at	home	in	the	water	as	the	fish	themselves,	and	can swim	fast	enough	to	catch	them	by	chasing	them.	So	he	didn't	move	so	much	as an	eye	lash.	He	was	so	still	that	he	looked	almost	like	the	stump	of	an	old	tree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps	that	is	what	the	fish	thought	he	was,	for	pretty	soon,	two	or	three	swam right	in	close	to	where	he	was	sitting.	Now	Buster	Bear	may	be	big	and	clumsy looking,	but	there	isn't	anything	that	can	move	much	quicker	than	one	of	those big	paws	of	his	when	he	wants	it	to.	One	of	them	moved	now,	and	quicker	than	a wink	had	scooped	one	of	those	foolish	fish	out	on	to	the	bank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Buster's	little	eyes	twinkled,	and	he	smacked	his	lips	as	he	moved	on	to	the	next little	pool,	for	he	knew	that	it	was	of	no	use	to	stay	longer	at	the	first	one.	The fish	 were	 so	 frightened	 that	 they	 wouldn't	 come	 back	 for	 a	 long,	 long	 time.	 At the	next	little	pool	the	same	thing	happened.	By	this	time	Buster	Bear	was	in	fine spirits.	It	was	fun	to	catch	the	fish,	and	it	was	still	more	fun	to	eat	them.	What finer	 breakfast	 could	 any	 one	 have	 than	 fresh-caught	 trout?	 No	 wonder	 he	 felt good!	But	it	takes	more	than	three	trout	to	fill	Buster	Bear's	stomach,	so	he	kept on	to	the	next	little	pool. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	this	little	pool,	instead	of	being	beautiful	and	clear	so	that	Buster	could	see right	to	 the	 bottom	of	 it	 and	so	 tell	 if	 there	were	 any	 fish	there,	 was	 so	muddy that	he	couldn't	see	into	it	at	all.	It	looked	as	if	some	one	had	just	stirred	up	all the	mud	at	the	bottom. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>"Huh!"	said	Buster	Bear.	"It's	of	no	use	to	try	to	fish	here.	I	would	just	waste	my time.	I'll	try	the	next	pool." </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	he	went	on	to	the	next	little	pool.	He	found	this	just	as	muddy	as	the	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 he	 went	 on	 to	 another,	 and	 this	 was	 no	 better.	 Buster	 sat	 down	 and scratched	his	head.	It	was	puzzling.	Yes,	Sir,	it	was	puzzling.	He	looked	this	way and	he	looked	that	way	suspiciously,	but	there	was	no	one	to	be	seen.	Everything was	 still	 save	 for	 the	 laughter	 of	 the	 Laughing	 Brook.	 Somehow,	 it	 seemed	 to Buster	as	if	the	Brook	were	laughing	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	 very	 curious,"	 muttered	 Buster,	 "very	 curious	 indeed.	 It	 looks	 as	 if	 my fishing	is	spoiled	for	to-day.	I	don't	understand	it	at	all.	It's	lucky	I	caught	what	I did.	It	looks	as	if	somebody	is	trying	to—ha!"	A	sudden	thought	had	popped	into his	head.	Then	he	began	to	chuckle	and	finally	to	laugh.	"I	do	believe	that	scamp Joe	Otter	is	trying	to	get	even	with	me	for	eating	that	fat	trout!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then,	 because	 Buster	 Bear	 always	 enjoys	 a	 good	 joke	 even	 when	 it	 is	 on himself,	 he	 laughed	 until	 he	 had	 to	 hold	 his	 sides,	 which	 is	 a	 whole	 lot	 better than	 going	 off	 in	 a	 rage	 as	 Little	 Joe	 Otter	 had	 done.	 "You're	 pretty	 smart,	 Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Otter!	 You're	 pretty	 smart,	 but	 there	 are	 other	 people	 who	 are	 smart	 too,"	 said Buster	Bear,	and	still	chuckling,	he	went	off	to	think	up	a	plan	to	get	the	best	of Little	Joe	Otter. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">LITTLE	JOE	OTTER	SUPPLIES	BUSTER</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">BEAR	WITH	A	BREAKFAST</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Getting	even	just	for	spite</p>
<p class="calibre1">Doesn't	always	pay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fact	is,	it	is	very	apt</p>
<p class="calibre1">To	work	the	other	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 is	 just	 how	 it	 came	 about	 that	 Little	 Joe	 Otter	 furnished	 Buster	 Bear	 with the	best	breakfast	he	had	had	for	a	long	time.	He	didn't	mean	to	do	it.	Oh,	my, no!	The	truth	is,	he	thought	all	the	time	that	he	was	preventing	Buster	Bear	from getting	 a	 breakfast.	 You	 see	 he	 wasn't	 well	 enough	 acquainted	 with	 Buster	 to know	that	Buster	is	quite	as	smart	as	he	is,	and	perhaps	a	little	bit	smarter.	Spite and	selfishness	were	at	the	bottom	of	it.	You	see	Little	Joe	and	Billy	Mink	had had	all	the	fishing	in	the	Laughing	Brook	to	themselves	so	long	that	they	thought no	one	else	had	any	right	to	fish	there.	To	be	sure	Bobby	Coon	caught	a	few	little fish	 there,	 but	 they	 didn't	 mind	 Bobby.	 Farmer	 Brown's	 boy	 fished	 there	 too, sometimes,	and	this	always	made	Little	Joe	and	Billy	Mink	very	angry,	but	they were	so	afraid	of	him	that	they	didn't	dare	do	anything	about	it.	But	when	they discovered	 that	 Buster	 Bear	 was	 a	 fisherman,	 they	 made	 up	 their	 minds	 that something	had	got	to	be	done.	At	least,	Little	Joe	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He'll	try	it	again	to-morrow	morning,"	said	Little	Joe.	"I'll	keep	watch,	and	as soon	as	I	see	him	coming,	I'll	drive	out	all	the	fish,	just	as	I	did	to-day.	I	guess that'll	teach	him	to	let	our	fish	alone." </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	the	next	morning	Little	Joe	hid	before	daylight	close	by	the	little	pool	where Buster	 Bear	 had	 given	 him	 such	 a	 fright.	 Sure	 enough,	 just	 as	 the	 Jolly Sunbeams	began	to	creep	through	the	Green	Forest,	he	saw	Buster	Bear	coming straight	over	to	the	little	pool.	Little	Joe	slipped	into	the	water	and	chased	all	the fish	out	of	the	little	pool,	and	stirred	up	the	mud	on	the	bottom	so	that	the	water was	so	muddy	that	the	bottom	couldn't	be	seen	at	all.	Then	he	hurried	down	to the	next	little	pool	and	did	the	same	thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	 Buster	 Bear	 is	 very	 smart.	 You	 know	 he	 had	 guessed	 the	 day	 before	 who</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>had	spoiled	his	fishing.	So	this	morning	he	only	went	far	enough	to	make	sure that	if	Little	Joe	were	watching	for	him,	as	he	was	sure	he	would	be,	he	would see	 him	 coming.	 Then,	 instead	 of	 keeping	 on	 to	 the	 little	 pool,	 he	 hurried	 to	 a place	way	down	the	Laughing	Brook,	where	the	water	was	very	shallow,	hardly over	his	feet,	and	there	he	sat	chuckling	to	himself.	Things	happened	just	as	he had	 expected.	 The	 frightened	 fish	 Little	 Joe	 chased	 out	 of	 the	 little	 pools	 up above	 swam	 down	 the	 Laughing	 Brook,	 because,	 you	 know,	 Little	 Joe	 was behind	them,	and	there	was	nowhere	else	for	them	to	go.	When	they	came	to	the place	where	Buster	was	waiting,	all	he	had	to	do	was	to	scoop	them	out	on	to	the bank.	It	was	great	fun.	It	didn't	take	Buster	long	to	catch	all	the	fish	he	could	eat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he	saved	a	nice	fat	trout	and	waited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	 and	 by	 along	 came	 Little	 Joe	 Otter,	 chuckling	 to	 think	 how	 he	 had	 spoiled Buster	 Bear's	 fishing.	 He	 was	 so	 intent	 on	 looking	 behind	 him	 to	 see	 if	 Buster was	coming	that	he	didn't	see	Buster	waiting	there	until	he	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm	much	obliged	for	the	fine	breakfast	you	have	given	me,"	said	Buster	in	his deepest,	most	grumbly-rumbly	voice.	"I've	saved	a	fat	trout	for	you	to	make	up for	the	one	I	ate	yesterday.	I	hope	we'll	go	fishing	together	often." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he	went	off	laughing	fit	to	kill	himself.	Little	Joe	couldn't	find	a	word	to say.	He	was	so	surprised	and	angry	that	he	went	off	by	himself	and	sulked.	And Billy	Mink,	who	had	been	watching,	ate	the	fat	trout. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">GRANDFATHER	FROG'S	COMMON-SENSE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 is	 nothing	 quite	 like	 common	 sense	 to	 smooth	 out	 troubles.	 People	 who have	plenty	of	just	plain	common	sense	are	often	thought	to	be	very	wise.	Their neighbors	look	up	to	them	and	are	forever	running	to	them	for	advice,	and	they are	very	much	respected.	That	is	the	way	with	Grandfather	Frog.	He	is	very	old and	very	wise.	Anyway,	that	is	what	his	neighbors	think.	The	truth	is,	he	simply has	a	lot	of	common	sense,	which	after	all	is	the	very	best	kind	of	wisdom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	 when	 Little	 Joe	 Otter	 found	 that	 Buster	 Bear	 had	 been	 too	 smart	 for	 him and	that	instead	of	spoiling	Buster's	fishing	in	the	Laughing	Brook	he	had	really made	it	easier	for	Buster	to	catch	all	the	fish	he	wanted,	Little	Joe	went	off	down to	the	Smiling	Pool	in	a	great	rage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Billy	 Mink	 stopped	 long	 enough	 to	 eat	 the	 fat	 fish	 Buster	 had	 left	 on	 the	 bank and	then	he	too	went	down	to	the	Smiling	Pool. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Little	Joe	Otter	and	Billy	Mink	reached	the	Smiling	Pool,	they	climbed	up on	the	Big	Rock,	and	there	Little	Joe	sulked	and	sulked,	until	finally	Grandfather Frog	asked	what	the	matter	was.	Little	Joe	wouldn't	tell,	but	Billy	Mink	told	the whole	 story.	 When	 he	 told	 how	 Buster	 had	 been	 too	 smart	 for	 Little	 Joe,	 it tickled	 him	 so	 that	 Billy	 had	 to	 laugh	 in	 spite	 of	 himself.	 So	 did	 Grandfather Frog.	So	did	Jerry	Muskrat,	who	had	been	listening.	Of	course	this	made	Little Joe	angrier	than	ever.	He	said	a	lot	of	unkind	things	about	Buster	Bear	and	about Billy	Mink	and	Grandfather	Frog	and	Jerry	Muskrat,	because	they	had	laughed at	the	smartness	of	Buster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's	nothing	but	a	great	big	bully	and	thief!"	declared	Little	Joe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Chug-a-rum!	 He	 may	 be	 a	 bully,	 because	 great	 big	 people	 are	 very	 apt	 to	 be bullies,	and	though	I	haven't	seen	him,	I	guess	Buster	Bear	is	big	enough	from all	I	have	heard,	but	I	don't	see	how	he	is	a	thief,"	said	Grandfather	Frog. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Didn't	he	catch	my	fish	and	eat	them?"	snapped	Little	Joe.	"Doesn't	that	make him	a	thief?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>"They	were	no	more	your	fish	than	mine,"	protested	Billy	Mink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,  <i class="calibre4">our</i>	fish,	then!	He	stole	 <i class="calibre4">our</i>	 fish,	 if	 you	 like	 that	 any	 better.	 That	 makes him	just	as	much	a	thief,	doesn't	it?"	growled	Little	Joe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grandfather	 Frog	 looked	 up	 at	 jolly,	 round,	 bright	 Mr.	 Sun	 and	 slowly	 winked one	of	his	great,	goggly	eyes.	"There	comes	a	foolish	green	fly,"	said	he.	"Who does	he	belong	to?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nobody!"	snapped	Little	Joe.	"What	have	foolish	green	flies	got	to	do	with	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">—I	mean	 <i class="calibre4">our</i>	fish?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothing,	 nothing	 at	 all,"	 replied	 Grandfather	 Frog	 mildly.	 "I	 was	 just	 hoping that	he	would	come	near	enough	for	me	to	snap	him	up;	then	he	would	belong	to me.	As	long	as	he	doesn't,	he	doesn't	belong	to	any	one.	I	suppose	that	if	Buster Bear	 should	 happen	 along	 and	 catch	 him,	 he	 would	 be	 stealing	 from	 me, according	to	Little	Joe." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	 course	 not!	 What	 a	 silly	 idea!	 You're	 getting	 foolish	 in	 your	 old	 age," </p>
<p class="calibre1">retorted	Little	Joe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can	you	tell	me	the	difference	between	the	fish	that	you	haven't	caught	and	the foolish	green	flies	that	I	haven't	caught?"	asked	Grandfather	Frog. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Joe	couldn't	find	a	word	to	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	take	my	advice,	Little	Joe	Otter,"	continued	Grandfather	Frog,	"and	always make	friends	with	those	who	are	bigger	and	stronger	and	smarter	than	you	are. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You'll	find	it	pays." </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">LITTLE	JOE	OTTER	TAKES	GRANDFATHER</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">FROG'S	ADVICE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Who	makes	an	enemy	a	friend, </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	fear	and	worry	puts	an	end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	 Joe	 Otter	 found	 that	 out	 when	 he	 took	 Grandfather	 Frog's	 advice.	 He wouldn't	have	admitted	that	he	was	afraid	of	Buster	Bear.	No	one	ever	likes	to admit	being	afraid,	least	of	all	Little	Joe	Otter.	And	really	Little	Joe	has	a	great deal	 of	 courage.	 Very	 few	 of	 the	 little	 people	 of	 the	 Green	 Forest	 or	 the	 Green Meadows	would	willingly	quarrel	with	him,	for	Little	Joe	is	a	great	fighter	when he	has	to	fight.	As	for	all	those	who	live	in	or	along	the	Laughing	Brook	or	in the	Smiling	Pool,	they	let	Little	Joe	have	his	own	way	in	everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	having	one's	own	way	too	much	is	a	bad	thing.	It	is	apt	to	make	one	selfish and	thoughtless	of	other	people	and	very	hard	to	get	along	with.	Little	Joe	Otter had	 his	 way	 too	 much.	 Grandfather	 Frog	 knew	 it	 and	 shook	 his	 head	 very soberly	when	Little	Joe	had	been	disrespectful	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Too	 bad.	 Too	 bad!	 Too	 bad!	 Chug-a-rum!	 It	 is	 too	 bad	 that	 such	 a	 fine	 young fellow	as	Little	Joe	should	spoil	a	good	disposition	by	such	selfish	heedlessness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Too	bad,"	said	he. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	though	he	didn't	let	on	that	it	was	so,	Grandfather	Frog	really	was	delighted when	he	heard	how	Buster	Bear	had	been	too	smart	for	Little	Joe	Otter.	It	tickled him	so	that	he	had	hard	work	to	keep	a	straight	face.	But	he	did	and	was	as	grave and	solemn	as	you	please	as	he	advised	Little	Joe	always	to	make	friends	with any	 one	 who	 was	 bigger	 and	 stronger	 and	 smarter	 than	 he.	 That	 was	 good common	sense	advice,	but	Little	Joe	just	sniffed	and	went	off	declaring	that	he would	get	even	with	Buster	Bear	yet.	Now	Little	Joe	is	good-natured	and	full	of fun	 as	 a	 rule,	 and	 after	 he	 had	 reached	 home	 and	 his	 temper	 had	 cooled	 off	 a little,	he	began	to	see	the	joke	on	himself,—how	when	he	had	worked	so	hard	to frighten	 the	 fish	 in	 the	 little	 pools	 of	 the	 Laughing	 Brook	 so	 that	 Buster	 Bear should	 not	 catch	 any,	 he	 had	 all	 the	 time	 been	 driving	 them	 right	 into	 Buster's paws.	 By	 and	 by	 he	 grinned.	 It	 was	 a	 little	 sheepish	 grin	 at	 first,	 but	 at	 last	 it</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>grew	into	a	laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	 believe,"	 said	 Little	 Joe	 as	 he	 wiped	 tears	 of	 laughter	 from	 his	 eyes,	 "that Grandfather	Frog	is	right,	and	that	the	best	thing	I	can	do	is	to	make	friends	with Buster	Bear.	I'll	try	it	to-morrow	morning." </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	very	early	the	next	morning	Little	Joe	Otter	went	to	the	best	fishing	pool	he knew	of	in	the	Laughing	Brook,	and	there	he	caught	the	biggest	trout	he	could find.	It	was	so	big	and	fat	that	it	made	Little	Joe's	mouth	water,	for	you	know	fat trout	 are	 his	 favorite	 food.	 But	 he	 didn't	 take	 so	 much	 as	 one	 bite.	 Instead	 he carefully	 laid	 it	 on	 an	 old	 log	 where	 Buster	 Bear	 would	 be	 sure	 to	 see	 it	 if	 he should	come	along	that	way.	Then	he	hid	near	by,	where	he	could	watch.	Buster was	late	that	morning.	It	seemed	to	Little	Joe	that	he	never	would	come.	Once	he nearly	lost	the	fish.	He	had	turned	his	head	for	just	a	minute,	and	when	he	looked back	again,	the	trout	was	nowhere	to	be	seen.	Buster	couldn't	have	stolen	up	and taken	 it,	 because	 such	 a	 big	 fellow	 couldn't	 possibly	 have	 gotten	 out	 of	 sight again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Joe	darted	over	to	the	log	and	looked	on	the	other	side.	There	was	the	fat trout,	and	there	also	was	Little	Joe's	smallest	cousin,	Shadow	the	Weasel,	who	is a	great	thief	and	altogether	bad.	Little	Joe	sprang	at	him	angrily,	but	Shadow	was too	 quick	 and	 darted	 away.	 Little	 Joe	 put	 the	 fish	 back	 on	 the	 log	 and	 waited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	time	he	didn't	take	his	eyes	off	it.	At	last,	when	he	was	almost	ready	to	give up,	he	saw	Buster	Bear	shuffling	along	towards	the	Laughing	Brook.	Suddenly Buster	stopped	and	sniffed.	One	of	the	Merry	Little	Breezes	had	carried	the	scent of	that	fat	trout	over	to	him.	Then	he	came	straight	over	to	where	the	fish	lay,	his nose	wrinkling,	and	his	eyes	twinkling	with	pleasure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now	I	wonder	who	was	so	thoughtful	as	to	leave	this	fine	breakfast	ready	for me,"	said	he	out	loud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Me,"	said	Little	Joe	in	a	rather	faint	voice.	"I	caught	it	especially	for	you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank	you,"	replied	Buster,	and	his	eyes	twinkled	more	than	ever.	"I	think	we are	going	to	be	friends." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I—I	hope	so,"	replied	Little	Joe. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a><b class="calibre3">VII</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">FARMER	BROWN'S	BOY	HAS	NO	LUCK</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">AT	ALL</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Farmer	 Brown's	 boy	 tramped	 through	 the	 Green	 Forest,	 whistling	 merrily.	 He always	 whistles	 when	 he	 feels	 light-hearted,	 and	 he	 always	 feels	 light-hearted when	he	goes	fishing.	You	see,	he	is	just	as	fond	of	fishing	as	is	Little	Joe	Otter or	 Billy	 Mink	 or	 Buster	 Bear.	 And	 now	 he	 was	 making	 his	 way	 through	 the Green	 Forest	 to	 the	 Laughing	 Brook,	 sure	 that	 by	 the	 time	 he	 had	 followed	 it down	 to	 the	 Smiling	 Pool	 he	 would	 have	 a	 fine	 lot	 of	 trout	 to	 take	 home.	 He knew	every	pool	in	the	Laughing	Brook	where	the	trout	love	to	hide,	did	Farmer Brown's	 boy,	 and	 it	 was	 just	 the	 kind	 of	 a	 morning	 when	 the	 trout	 should	 be hungry.	So	he	whistled	as	he	tramped	along,	and	his	whistle	was	good	to	hear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	reached	the	first	little	pool	he	baited	his	hook	very	carefully	and	then, taking	the	greatest	care	to	keep	out	of	sight	of	any	trout	that	might	be	in	the	little pool,	he	began	to	fish.	Now	Farmer	Brown's	boy	learned	a	long	time	ago	that	to be	a	successful	fisherman	one	must	have	a	great	deal	of	patience,	so	though	he didn't	 get	 a	 bite	 right	 away	 as	 he	 had	 expected	 to,	 he	 wasn't	 the	 least	 bit discouraged.	 He	 kept	 very	 quiet	 and	 fished	 and	 fished,	 patiently	 waiting	 for	 a foolish	trout	to	take	his	hook.	But	he	didn't	get	so	much	as	a	nibble.	"Either	the trout	 have	 lost	 their	 appetite	 or	 they	 have	 grown	 very	 wise,"	 muttered	 Farmer Brown's	boy,	as	after	a	long	time	he	moved	on	to	the	next	little	pool. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	the	same	thing	happened.	He	was	very	patient,	very,	very	patient,	but	his patience	brought	no	reward,	not	so	much	as	the	faintest	kind	of	a	nibble.	Farmer Brown's	boy	trudged	on	to	the	next	pool,	and	there	was	a	puzzled	frown	on	his freckled	face.	Such	a	thing	never	had	happened	before.	He	didn't	know	what	to make	 of	 it.	 All	 the	 night	 before	 he	 had	 dreamed	 about	 the	 delicious	 dinner	 of fried	trout	he	would	have	the	next	day,	and	now—well,	if	he	didn't	catch	some trout	pretty	soon,	that	splendid	dinner	would	never	be	anything	but	a	dream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	 I	 didn't	 know	 that	 nobody	 else	 comes	 fishing	 here,	 I	 should	 think	 that somebody	 had	 been	 here	 this	 very	 morning	 and	 caught	 all	 the	 fish	 or	 else frightened	them	so	that	they	are	all	in	hiding,"	said	he,	as	he	trudged	on	to	the next	little	pool.	"I	never	had	such	bad	luck	in	all	my	life	before.	Hello!	What's</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>this?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">There,	 on	 the	 bank	 beside	 the	 little	 pool,	 were	 the	 heads	 of	 three	 trout.	 Farmer Brown's	 boy	 scowled	 down	 at	 them	 more	 puzzled	 than	 ever.	 "Somebody	  <i class="calibre4">has</i> been	 fishing	 here,	 and	 they	 have	 had	 better	 luck	 than	 I	 have,"	 thought	 he.	 He looked	up	the	Laughing	Brook	and	down	the	Laughing	Brook	and	this	way	and that	 way,	 but	 no	 one	 was	 to	 be	 seen.	 Then	 he	 picked	 up	 one	 of	 the	 little	 heads and	 looked	 at	 it	 sharply.	 "It	 wasn't	 cut	 off	 with	 a	 knife;	 it	 was	 bitten	 off!"	 he exclaimed.	"I	wonder	now	if	Billy	Mink	is	the	scamp	who	has	spoiled	my	fun." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thereafter	he	kept	a	sharp	lookout	for	signs	of	Billy	Mink,	but	though	he	found two	or	three	more	trout	heads,	he	saw	no	other	signs	and	he	caught	no	fish.	This puzzled	 him	 more	 than	 ever.	 It	 didn't	 seem	 possible	 that	 such	 a	 little	 fellow	 as Billy	Mink	could	have	caught	or	frightened	all	the	fish	or	have	eaten	so	many. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Besides,	he	didn't	remember	ever	having	known	Billy	to	leave	heads	around	that way.	 Billy	 sometimes	 catches	 more	 fish	 than	 he	 can	 eat,	 but	 then	 he	 usually hides	 them.	 The	 farther	 he	 went	 down	 the	 Laughing	 Brook,	 the	 more	 puzzled Farmer	Brown's	boy	grew.	It	made	him	feel	very	queer.	He	would	have	felt	still more	queer	if	he	had	known	that	all	the	time	two	other	fishermen	who	had	been before	 him	 were	 watching	 him	 and	 chuckling	 to	 themselves.	 They	 were	 Little Joe	Otter	and	Buster	Bear. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">FARMER	BROWN'S	BOY	FEELS	HIS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">HAIR	RISE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">'Twas	just	a	sudden	odd	surprise</p>
<p class="calibre1">Made	Farmer	Brown's	boy's	hair	to	rise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's	a	funny	thing	for	hair	to	do—rise	up	all	of	a	sudden—isn't	it?	But	that	is just	what	the	hair	on	Farmer	Brown's	boy's	head	did	the	day	he	went	fishing	in the	Laughing	Brook	and	had	no	luck	at	all.	There	are	just	two	things	that	make hair	rise—anger	and	fear.	Anger	sometimes	makes	the	hair	on	the	back	and	neck of	 Bowser	 the	 Hound	 and	 of	 some	 other	 little	 people	 bristle	 and	 stand	 up,	 and you	know	the	 hair	on	the	 tail	of	Black	 Pussy	stands	on	 end	 until	 her	 tail	 looks twice	as	big	as	it	really	is.	Both	anger	and	fear	make	it	do	that.	But	there	is	only one	thing	that	can	make	the	hair	on	the	head	of	Farmer	Brown's	boy	rise,	and	as it	isn't	anger,	of	course	it	must	be	fear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	never	had	happened	before.	You	see,	there	isn't	much	of	anything	that	Farmer Brown's	boy	is	really	afraid	of.	Perhaps	he	wouldn't	have	been	afraid	this	time	if it	hadn't	been	for	the	surprise	of	what	he	found.	You	see	when	he	had	found	the heads	of	those	trout	on	the	bank	he	knew	right	away	that	some	one	else	had	been fishing,	and	that	was	why	he	couldn't	catch	any;	but	it	didn't	seem	possible	that little	Billy	Mink	could	have	eaten	all	those	trout,	and	Farmer	Brown's	boy	didn't once	think	of	Little	Joe	Otter,	and	so	he	was	very,	very	much	puzzled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	turning	it	all	over	in	his	mind	and	studying	what	it	could	mean,	when	he came	 to	 a	 little	 muddy	 place	 on	 the	 bank	 of	 the	 Laughing	 Brook,	 and	 there	 he saw	 something	 that	 made	 his	 eyes	 look	 as	 if	 they	 would	 pop	 right	 out	 of	 his head,	and	it	was	right	then	that	he	felt	his	hair	rise.	Anyway,	that	is	what	he	said when	he	told	about	it	afterward.	What	was	it	he	saw?	What	do	you	think?	Why, it	was	a	footprint	in	the	soft	mud.	Yes,	Sir,	that's	what	it	was,	and	all	it	was.	But it	was	the	biggest	footprint	Farmer	Brown's	boy	ever	had	seen,	and	it	looked	as	if it	had	been	made	only	a	few	minutes	before.	It	was	the	footprint	of	Buster	Bear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	 Farmer	 Brown's	 boy	 didn't	 know	 that	 Buster	 Bear	 had	 come	 down	 to	 the Green	 Forest	 to	 live.	 He	 never	 had	 heard	 of	 a	 Bear	 being	 in	 the	 Green	 Forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>And	so	he	was	so	surprised	that	he	had	hard	work	to	believe	his	own	eyes,	and he	had	a	queer	feeling	all	over,—a	little	chilly	feeling,	although	it	was	a	warm day.	Somehow,	he	didn't	feel	like	meeting	Buster	Bear.	If	he	had	had	his	terrible gun	 with	 him,	 it	 might	 have	 been	 different.	 But	 he	 didn't,	 and	 so	 he	 suddenly made	up	his	mind	that	he	didn't	want	to	fish	any	more	that	day.	He	had	a	funny feeling,	 too,	 that	 he	 was	 being	 watched,	 although	 he	 couldn't	 see	 any	 one.	 He <i class="calibre4">was</i>	 being	 watched.	 Little	 Joe	 Otter	 and	 Buster	 Bear	 were	 watching	 him	 and taking	the	greatest	care	to	keep	out	of	his	sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 the	 way	 home	 through	 the	 Green	 Forest,	 Farmer	 Brown's	 boy	 kept	 looking behind	 him,	 and	 he	 didn't	 draw	 a	 long	 breath	 until	 he	 reached	 the	 edge	 of	 the Green	Forest.	He	hadn't	run,	but	he	had	wanted	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Huh!"	said	Buster	Bear	to	Little	Joe	Otter,	"I	believe	he	was	afraid!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	Buster	Bear	was	just	exactly	right. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">LITTLE	JOE	OTTER	HAS	GREAT	NEWS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">TO	TELL</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	 Joe	 Otter	 was	 fairly	 bursting	 with	 excitement.	 He	 could	 hardly	 contain himself.	He	felt	that	he	had	the	greatest	news	to	tell	since	Peter	Rabbit	had	first found	 the	 tracks	 of	 Buster	 Bear	 in	 the	 Green	 Forest.	 He	 couldn't	 keep	 it	 to himself	a	minute	longer	than	he	had	to.	So	he	hurried	to	the	Smiling	Pool,	where he	was	sure	he	would	find	Billy	Mink	and	Jerry	Muskrat	and	Grandfather	Frog and	Spotty	the	Turtle,	and	he	hoped	that	perhaps	some	of	the	little	people	who live	in	the	Green	Forest	might	be	there	too.	Sure	enough,	Peter	Rabbit	was	there on	 one	 side	 of	 the	 Smiling	 Pool,	 making	 faces	 at	 Reddy	 Fox,	 who	 was	 on	 the other	side,	which,	of	course,	was	not	at	all	nice	of	Peter.	Mr.	and	Mrs.	Redwing were	there,	and	Blacky	the	Crow	was	sitting	in	the	Big	Hickory-tree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	 Joe	 Otter	 swam	 straight	 to	 the	 Big	 Rock	 and	 climbed	 up	 to	 the	 very highest	part.	He	looked	so	excited,	and	his	eyes	sparkled	so,	that	every	one	knew right	away	that	something	had	happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hi!"	cried	Billy	Mink.	"Look	at	Little	Joe	Otter!	It	must	be	that	for	once	he	has been	smarter	than	Buster	Bear." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	 Joe	 made	 a	 good-natured	 face	 at	 Billy	 Mink	 and	 shook	 his	 head.	 "No, Billy,"	said	he,	"you	are	wrong,	altogether	wrong.	I	don't	believe	anybody	can	be smarter	than	Buster	Bear." </p>

<p class="calibre1">Reddy	Fox	rolled	his	lips	back	in	an	unpleasant	grin.	"Don't	be	too	sure	of	that!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	snapped.	"I'm	not	through	with	him	yet." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>"Boaster!	Boaster!"	cried	Peter	Rabbit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reddy	glared	across	the	Smiling	Pool	at	Peter.	"I'm	not	through	with	you	either, Peter	Rabbit!"	he	snarled.	"You'll	find	it	out	one	of	these	fine	days!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>"Reddy,	Reddy,	smart	and	sly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Couldn't	catch	a	buzzing	fly!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">taunted	Peter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Chug-a-rum!"	 said	 Grandfather	 Frog	 in	 his	 deepest,	 gruffest	 voice.	 "We	 know all	 about	 that.	 What	 we	 want	 to	 know	 is	 what	 Little	 Joe	 Otter	 has	 got	 on	 his mind." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's	news—great	news!"	cried	Little	Joe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	can	tell	better	how	great	it	is	when	we	hear	what	it	is,"	replied	Grandfather Frog	testily.	"What	is	it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	 Joe	 Otter	 looked	 around	 at	 all	 the	 eager	 faces	 watching	 him,	 and	 then	 in the	slowest,	most	provoking	way,	he	drawled:	"Farmer	Brown's	boy	is	afraid	of Buster	Bear." </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	minute	no	one	said	a	word.	Then	Blacky	the	Crow	leaned	down	from	his perch	in	the	Big	Hickory-tree	and	looked	very	hard	at	Little	Joe	as	he	said:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	don't	believe	it.	I	don't	believe	a	word	of	it.	Farmer	Brown's	boy	isn't	afraid	of any	 one	 who	 lives	 in	 the	 Green	 Forest	 or	 on	 the	 Green	 Meadows	 or	 in	 the Smiling	Pool,	and	you	know	it.	We	are	all	afraid	of	him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Joe	glared	back	at	Blacky.	"I	don't	care	whether	you	believe	it	or	not;	it's true,"	he	retorted.	Then	he	told	how	early	that	very	morning	he	and	Buster	Bear had	been	fishing	together	in	the	Laughing	Brook,	and	how	Farmer	Brown's	boy had	been	fishing	there	too,	and	hadn't	caught	a	single	trout	because	they	had	all been	caught	or	frightened	before	he	got	there.	Then	he	told	how	Farmer	Brown's boy	 had	 found	 a	 footprint	 of	 Buster	 Bear	 in	 the	 soft	 mud,	 and	 how	 he	 had stopped	fishing	right	away	and	started	for	home,	looking	behind	him	with	fear	in his	eyes	all	the	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now	tell	me	that	he	isn't	afraid!"	concluded	Little	Joe.	"For	once	he	knows	just how	 we	 feel	 when	 he	 comes	 prowling	 around	 where	 we	 are.	 Isn't	 that	 great news?	Now	we'll	get	even	with	 <i class="calibre4">him</i>!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll	believe	it	when	I	see	it	for	myself!"	snapped	Blacky	the	Crow. </p>

<a id="p29"></a><b class="calibre3">X</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">BUSTER	BEAR	BECOMES	A	HERO</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 news	 that	 Little	 Joe	 Otter	 told	 at	 the	 Smiling	 Pool,—how	 Farmer	 Brown's boy	had	run	away	from	Buster	Bear	without	even	seeing	him,—soon	spread	all over	 the	 Green	 Meadows	 and	 through	 the	 Green	 Forest,	 until	 every	 one	 who lives	 there	 knew	 about	 it.	 Of	 course,	 Peter	 Rabbit	 helped	 spread	 it.	 Trust	 Peter for	 that!	 But	 everybody	 else	 helped	 too.	 You	 see,	 they	 had	 all	 been	 afraid	 of Farmer	 Brown's	 boy	 for	 so	 long	 that	 they	 were	 tickled	 almost	 to	 pieces	 at	 the very	 thought	 of	 having	 some	 one	 in	 the	 Green	 Forest	 who	 could	 make	 Farmer Brown's	boy	feel	fear	as	they	had	felt	it.	And	so	it	was	that	Buster	Bear	became	a hero	right	away	to	most	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	doubted	Little	Joe's	story.	One	of	them	was	Blacky	the	Crow.	Another	was Reddy	Fox.	Blacky	doubted	because	he	knew	Farmer	Brown's	boy	so	well	that he	 couldn't	 imagine	 him	 afraid.	 Reddy	 doubted	 because	 he	 didn't	 want	 to believe.	 You	 see,	 he	 was	 jealous	 of	 Buster	 Bear,	 and	 at	 the	 same	 time	 he	 was afraid	of	him.	So	Reddy	pretended	not	to	believe	a	word	of	what	Little	Joe	Otter had	 said,	 and	 he	 agreed	 with	 Blacky	 that	 only	 by	 seeing	 Farmer	 Brown's	 boy afraid	could	he	ever	be	made	to	believe	it.	But	nearly	everybody	else	believed	it, and	 there	 was	 great	 rejoicing.	 Most	 of	 them	 were	 afraid	 of	 Buster,	 very	 much afraid	of	him,	because	he	was	so	big	and	strong.	But	they	were	still	more	afraid of	 Farmer	 Brown's	 boy,	 because	 they	 didn't	 know	 him	 or	 understand	 him,	 and because	in	the	past	he	had	tried	to	catch	some	of	them	in	traps	and	had	hunted some	of	them	with	his	terrible	gun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	now	they	were	very	proud	to	think	that	one	of	their	own	number	actually	had frightened	him,	and	they	began	to	look	on	Buster	Bear	as	a	real	hero.	They	tried in	ever	so	many	ways	to	show	him	how	friendly	they	felt	and	went	quite	out	of their	way	to	do	him	favors.	Whenever	they	met	one	another,	all	they	could	talk about	was	the	smartness	and	the	greatness	of	Buster	Bear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now	 I	 guess	 Farmer	 Brown's	 boy	 will	 keep	 away	 from	 the	 Green	 Forest,	 and we	won't	have	to	be	all	the	time	watching	out	for	him,"	said	Bobby	Coon,	as	he washed	 his	 dinner	 in	 the	 Laughing	 Brook,	 for	 you	 know	 he	 is	 very	 neat	 and particular. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>"And	he	won't	dare	set	any	more	traps	for	me,"	gloated	Billy	Mink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah	wish	Brer	Bear	would	go	up	to	Farmer	Brown's	henhouse	and	scare	Farmer Brown's	boy	so	that	he	would	keep	away	from	there.	It	would	be	a	favor	to	me which	Ah	cert'nly	would	appreciate,"	said	Unc'	Billy	Possum	when	he	heard	the news. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's	all	go	together	and	tell	Buster	Bear	how	much	obliged	we	are	for	what	he has	done,"	proposed	Jerry	Muskrat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's	a	splendid	idea!"	cried	Little	Joe	Otter.	"We'll	do	it	right	away." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Caw,	 caw	 caw!"	 broke	 in	 Blacky	 the	 Crow.	 "I	 say,	 let's	 wait	 and	 see	 for ourselves	if	it	is	all	true." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of	course	it's	true!"	snapped	Little	Joe	Otter.	"Don't	you	believe	I'm	telling	the truth?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Certainly,	certainly.	Of	course	no	one	doubts	your	word,"	replied	Blacky,	with the	utmost	politeness.	"But	you	say	yourself	that	Farmer	Brown's	boy	didn't	see Buster	Bear,	but	only	his	footprint.	Perhaps	he	didn't	know	whose	it	was,	and	if he	had	he	wouldn't	have	been	afraid.	Now	I've	got	a	plan	by	which	we	can	see for	ourselves	if	he	really	is	afraid	of	Buster	Bear." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What	is	it?"	asked	Sammy	Jay	eagerly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blacky	the	Crow	shook	his	head	and	winked.	"That's	telling,"	said	he.	"I	want	to think	 it	 over.	 If	 you	 meet	 me	 at	 the	 Big	 Hickory-tree	 at	 sun-up	 to-morrow morning,	and	get	everybody	else	to	come	that	you	can,	perhaps	I	will	tell	you." </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">BLACKY	THE	CROW	TELLS	HIS	PLAN</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Blacky	is	a	dreamer! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blacky	is	a	schemer! </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	voice	is	strong; </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	things	go	wrong</p>
<p class="calibre1">Blacky	is	a	screamer! </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's	a	fact.	Blacky	the	Crow	is	forever	dreaming	and	scheming	and	almost	always it	is	of	mischief.	He	is	one	of	the	smartest	and	cleverest	of	all	the	little	people	of the	 Green	 Meadows	 and	 the	 Green	 Forest,	 and	 all	 the	 others	 know	 it.	 Blacky likes	 excitement.	 He	 wants	 something	 going	 on.	 The	 more	 exciting	 it	 is,	 the better	he	likes	it.	Then	he	has	a	chance	to	use	that	harsh	voice	of	his,	and	how	he does	use	it! </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	now,	as	he	sat	in	the	top	of	the	Big	Hickory-tree	beside	the	Smiling	Pool	and looked	 down	 on	 all	 the	 little	 people	 gathered	 there,	 he	 was	 very	 happy.	 In	 the first	 place	 he	 felt	 very	 important,	 and	 you	 know	 Blacky	 dearly	 loves	 to	 feel important.	 They	 had	 all	 come	 at	 his	 invitation	 to	 listen	 to	 a	 plan	 for	 seeing	 for themselves	 if	 it	 were	 really	 true	 that	 Farmer	 Brown's	 boy	 was	 afraid	 of	 Buster Bear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	Big	Rock	in	the	Smiling	Pool	sat	Little	Joe	Otter,	Billy	Mink,	and	Jerry Muskrat.	On	his	big,	green	lily-pad	sat	Grandfather	Frog.	On	another	lily-pad	sat Spotty	 the	 Turtle.	 On	 the	 bank	 on	 one	 side	 of	 the	 Smiling	 Pool	 were	 Peter Rabbit,	Jumper	the	Hare,	Danny	Meadow	Mouse,	Johnny	Chuck,	Jimmy	Skunk, Unc'	 Billy	 Possum,	 Striped	 Chipmunk	 and	 Old	 Mr.	 Toad.	 On	 the	 other	 side	 of the	Smiling	Pool	were	Reddy	Fox,	Digger	the	Badger,	and	Bobby	Coon.	In	the Big	Hickory-tree	were	Chatterer	the	Red	Squirrel,	Happy	Jack	the	Gray	Squirrel, and	Sammy	Jay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blacky	 waited	 until	 he	 was	 sure	 that	 no	 one	 else	 was	 coming.	 Then	 he	 cleared his	throat	very	loudly	and	began	to	speak.	"Friends,"	said	he. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everybody	 grinned,	 for	 Blacky	 has	 played	 so	 many	 sharp	 tricks	 that	 no	 one	 is really	 his	 friend	 unless	 it	 is	 that	 other	 mischief-maker,	 Sammy	 Jay,	 who,	 you</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>know,	is	Blacky's	cousin.	But	no	one	said	anything,	and	Blacky	went	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Little	Joe	Otter	has	told	us	how	he	saw	Farmer	Brown's	boy	hurry	home	when he	 found	 the	 footprint	 of	 Buster	 Bear	 on	 the	 edge	 of	 the	 Laughing	 Brook,	 and how	 all	 the	 way	 he	 kept	 looking	 behind	 him,	 as	 if	 he	 were	 afraid.	 Perhaps	 he was,	 and	 then	 again	 perhaps	 he	 wasn't.	 Perhaps	 he	 had	 something	 else	 on	 his mind.	 You	 have	 made	 a	 hero	 of	 Buster	 Bear,	 because	 you	 believe	 Little	 Joe's story.	Now	I	don't	say	that	I	don't	believe	it,	but	I	do	say	that	I	will	be	a	lot	more sure	 that	 Farmer	 Brown's	 boy	 is	 afraid	 of	 Buster	 when	 I	 see	 him	 run	 away myself.	Now	here	is	my	plan:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"To-morrow	morning,	very	early,	Sammy	Jay	and	I	will	make	a	great	fuss	near the	edge	of	the	Green	Forest.	Farmer	Brown's	boy	has	a	lot	of	curiosity,	and	he will	 be	 sure	 to	 come	 over	 to	 see	 what	 it	 is	 all	 about.	 Then	 we	 will	 lead	 him	 to where	Buster	Bear	is.	If	he	runs	away,	I	will	be	the	first	to	admit	that	Buster	Bear is	as	great	a	hero	as	some	of	you	seem	to	think	he	is.	It	is	a	very	simple	plan,	and if	you	will	all	hide	where	you	can	watch,	you	will	be	able	to	see	for	yourselves	if Little	Joe	Otter	is	right.	Now	what	do	you	say?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Right	away	everybody	began	to	talk	at	the	same	time.	It	was	such	a	simple	plan that	 everybody	 agreed	 to	 it.	 And	 it	 promised	 to	 be	 so	 exciting	 that	 everybody promised	 to	 be	 there,	 that	 is,	 everybody	 but	 Grandfather	 Frog	 and	 Spotty	 the Turtle,	who	didn't	care	to	go	so	far	away	from	the	Smiling	Pool.	So	it	was	agreed that	Blacky	should	try	his	plan	the	very	next	morning. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">BEAR	GROW	CURIOUS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Ever	since	it	was	light	enough	to	see	at	all,	Blacky	the	Crow	had	been	sitting	in the	 top	 of	 the	 tallest	 tree	 on	 the	 edge	 of	 the	 Green	 Forest	 nearest	 to	 Farmer Brown's	 house,	 and	 never	 for	 an	 instant	 had	 he	 taken	 his	 eyes	 from	 Farmer Brown's	back	door.	What	was	he	watching	for?	Why,	for	Farmer	Brown's	boy	to come	 out	 on	 his	 way	 to	 milk	 the	 cows.	 Meanwhile,	 Sammy	 Jay	 was	 slipping silently	through	the	Green	Forest,	looking	for	Buster	Bear,	so	that	when	the	time came	he	could	let	his	cousin,	Blacky	the	Crow,	know	just	where	Buster	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	 and	 by	 the	 back	 door	 of	 Farmer	 Brown's	 house	 opened,	 and	 out	 stepped Farmer	 Brown's	 boy.	 In	 each	 hand	 he	 carried	 a	 milk	 pail.	 Right	 away	 Blacky began	to	scream	at	the	top	of	his	lungs.	"Caw,	caw,	caw!"	shouted	Blacky.	"Caw, caw,	caw!"	And	all	the	time	he	flew	about	among	the	trees	near	the	edge	of	the Green	 Forest	 as	 if	 so	 excited	 that	 he	 couldn't	 keep	 still.	 Farmer	 Brown's	 boy looked	 over	 there	 as	 if	 he	 wondered	 what	 all	 that	 fuss	 was	 about,	 as	 indeed	 he did,	but	he	didn't	start	to	go	over	and	see.	No,	Sir,	he	started	straight	for	the	barn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blacky	didn't	know	what	to	make	of	it.	You	see,	smart	as	he	is	and	shrewd	as	he is,	Blacky	doesn't	know	anything	about	the	meaning	of	duty,	for	he	never	has	to work	excepting	to	get	enough	to	eat.	So,	when	Farmer	Brown's	boy	started	for the	barn	instead	of	for	the	Green	Forest,	Blacky	didn't	know	what	to	make	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 screamed	 harder	 and	 louder	 than	 ever,	 until	 his	 voice	 grew	 so	 hoarse	 he couldn't	scream	any	more,	but	Farmer	Brown's	boy	kept	right	on	to	the	barn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'd	like	to	know	what	you're	making	such	a	fuss	about,	Mr.	Crow,	but	I've	got	to feed	the	cows	and	milk	them	first,"	said	he. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	 all	 this	 time	 the	 other	 little	 people	 of	 the	 Green	 Forest	 and	 the	 Green Meadows	had	been	hiding	where	they	could	see	all	that	went	on.	When	Farmer Brown's	boy	disappeared	in	the	barn,	Chatterer	the	Red	Squirrel	snickered	right out	 loud.	 "Ha,	 ha,	 ha!	 This	 is	 a	 great	 plan	 of	 yours,	 Blacky!	 Ha,	 ha,	 ha!"	 he shouted.	 Blacky	 couldn't	 find	 a	 word	 to	 say.	 He	 just	 hung	 his	 head,	 which	 is something	Blacky	seldom	does. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>"Perhaps	 if	 we	 wait	 until	 he	 comes	 out	 again,	 he	 will	 come	 over	 here,"	 said Sammy	 Jay,	 who	 had	 joined	 Blacky.	 So	 it	 was	 decided	 to	 wait.	 It	 seemed	 as	 if Farmer	 Brown's	 boy	 never	 would	 come	 out,	 but	 at	 last	 he	 did.	 Blacky	 and Sammy	 Jay	 at	 once	 began	 to	 scream	 and	 make	 all	 the	 fuss	 they	 could.	 Farmer Brown's	 boy	 took	 the	 two	 pails	 of	 milk	 into	 the	 house,	 then	 out	 he	 came	 and started	straight	for	the	Green	Forest.	He	was	so	curious	to	know	what	it	all	meant that	he	couldn't	wait	another	minute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	there	was	some	one	else	with	a	great	deal	of	curiosity	also.	He	had	heard the	screaming	of	Blacky	the	Crow	and	Sammy	Jay,	and	he	had	listened	until	he couldn't	stand	it	another	minute.	He	just	 <i class="calibre4">had</i>	to	know	what	it	was	all	about.	So	at the	 same	 time	 Farmer	 Brown's	 boy	 started	 for	 the	 Green	 Forest,	 this	 other listener	started	towards	the	place	where	Blacky	and	Sammy	were	making	such	a racket.	He	walked	very	softly	so	as	not	to	make	a	sound.	It	was	Buster	Bear. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">FARMER	BROWN'S	BOY	AND	BUSTER</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">BEAR	MEET</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">If	you	should	meet	with	Buster	Bear</p>
<p class="calibre1">While	walking	through	the	wood, </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	would	you	do?	Now	tell	me	true, </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I'd</i>	run	the	best	I	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	is	what	Farmer	Brown's	boy	did	when	he	met	Buster	Bear,	and	a	lot	of	the little	 people	 of	 the	 Green	 Forest	 and	 some	 from	 the	 Green	 Meadows	 saw	 him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 Farmer	 Brown's	 boy	 came	 hurrying	 home	 from	 the	 Laughing	 Brook without	 any	 fish	 one	 day	 and	 told	 about	 the	 great	 footprint	 he	 had	 seen	 in	 a muddy	 place	 on	 the	 bank	 deep	 in	 the	 Green	 Forest,	 and	 had	 said	 his	 was	 sure that	 it	 was	 the	 footprint	 of	 a	 Bear,	 he	 had	 been	 laughed	 at.	 Farmer	 Brown	 had laughed	and	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why,"	said	he,	"there	hasn't	been	a	Bear	in	the	Green	Forest	for	years	and	years and	 years,	 not	 since	 my	 own	 grandfather	 was	 a	 little	 boy,	 and	 that,	 you	 know, was	a	long,	long,	long	time	ago.	If	you	want	to	find	Mr.	Bear,	you	will	have	to go	 to	 the	 Great	 Woods.	 I	 don't	 know	 who	 made	 that	 footprint,	 but	 it	 certainly couldn't	have	been	a	Bear.	I	think	you	must	have	imagined	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he	had	laughed	some	more,	all	of	which	goes	to	show	how	easy	it	is	to	be mistaken,	 and	 how	 foolish	 it	 is	 to	 laugh	 at	 things	 you	 really	 don't	 know	 about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Buster	Bear	 <i class="calibre4">had</i>	come	to	live	in	the	Green	Forest,	and	Farmer	Brown's	boy	 <i class="calibre4">had</i> seen	his	footprint.	But	Farmer	Brown	laughed	so	much	and	made	fun	of	him	so much,	that	at	last	his	boy	began	to	think	that	he	must	have	been	mistaken	after all.	So	when	he	heard	Blacky	the	Crow	and	Sammy	Jay	making	a	great	fuss	near the	edge	of	the	Green	Forest,	he	never	once	thought	of	Buster	Bear,	as	he	started over	to	see	what	was	going	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Blacky	and	Sammy	saw	him	coming,	they	moved	a	little	farther	in	to	the Green	Forest,	still	screaming	in	the	most	excited	way.	They	felt	sure	that	Farmer Brown's	 boy	 would	 follow	 them,	 and	 they	 meant	 to	 lead	 him	 to	 where	 Sammy had	 seen	 Buster	 Bear	 that	 morning.	 Then	 they	 would	 find	 out	 for	 sure	 if	 what</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>Little	Joe	Otter	had	said	was	true,—that	Farmer	Brown's	boy	really	was	afraid	of Buster	Bear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	all	around,	behind	trees	and	stumps,	and	under	thick	branches,	and	even	in tree	 tops,	 were	 other	 little	 people	 watching	 with	 round,	 wide-open	 eyes	 to	 see what	 would	 happen.	 It	 was	 very	 exciting,	 the	 most	 exciting	 thing	 they	 could remember.	 You	 see,	 they	 had	 come	 to	 believe	 that	 Farmer	 Brown's	 boy	 wasn't afraid	 of	 anybody	 or	 anything,	 and	 as	 most	 of	 them	 were	 very	 much	 afraid	 of him,	they	had	hard	work	to	believe	that	he	would	really	be	afraid	of	even	such	a great,	big,	strong	fellow	as	Buster	Bear.	Every	one	was	so	busy	watching	Farmer Brown's	boy	that	no	one	saw	Buster	coming	from	the	other	direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	see,	Buster	walked	very	softly.	Big	as	he	is,	he	can	walk	without	making	the teeniest,	 weeniest	 sound.	 And	 that	 is	 how	 it	 happened	 that	 no	 one	 saw	 him	 or heard	him	until	just	as	Farmer	Brown's	boy	stepped	out	from	behind	one	side	of a	thick	little	hemlock-tree,	Buster	Bear	stepped	out	from	behind	the	other	side	of that	same	little	tree,	and	there	they	were	face	to	face!	Then	everybody	held	their breath,	even	Blacky	the	Crow	and	Sammy	Jay.	For	just	a	little	minute	it	was	so still	there	in	the	Green	Forest	that	not	the	least	little	sound	could	be	heard.	What was	going	to	happen? </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a><b class="calibre3">XIV</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A	SURPRISING	THING	HAPPENS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Blacky	the	Crow	and	Sammy	Jay,	looking	down	from	the	top	of	a	tall	tree,	held their	 breath.	 Happy	 Jack	 the	 Gray	 Squirrel	 and	 his	 cousin,	 Chatterer	 the	 Red Squirrel,	looking	down	from	another	tree,	held	 <i class="calibre4">their</i>	breath.	Unc'	Billy	Possum, sticking	his	head	out	from	a	hollow	tree,	held	 <i class="calibre4">his</i>	breath.	Bobby	Coon,	looking through	a	hole	in	a	hollow	stump	in	which	he	was	hiding,	held	 <i class="calibre4">his</i>	breath.	Reddy Fox,	lying	flat	down	behind	a	heap	of	brush,	held	 <i class="calibre4">his</i>	breath.	Peter	Rabbit,	sitting bolt	 upright	 under	 a	 thick	 hemlock	 branch,	 with	 eyes	 and	 ears	 wide	 open,	 held <i class="calibre4">his</i>	breath.	And	all	the	other	little	people	who	happened	to	be	where	they	could see	did	the	same	thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	see,	it	was	the	most	exciting	moment	ever	was	in	the	Green	Forest.	Farmer Brown's	boy	had	just	stepped	out	from	behind	one	side	of	a	little	hemlock-tree and	Buster	Bear	had	just	stepped	out	from	behind	the	opposite	side	of	the	little hemlock-tree	 and	 neither	 had	 known	 that	 the	 other	 was	 anywhere	 near.	 For	 a whole	minute	they	stood	there	face	to	face,	gazing	into	each	other's	eyes,	while everybody	watched	and	waited,	and	it	seemed	as	if	the	whole	Green	Forest	was holding	its	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 something	 happened.	 Yes,	 Sir,	 something	 happened.	 Farmer	 Brown's	 boy opened	his	mouth	and	yelled!	It	was	such	a	sudden	yell	and	such	a	loud	yell	that it	startled	Chatterer	so	that	he	nearly	fell	from	his	place	in	the	tree,	and	it	made Reddy	Fox	jump	to	his	feet	ready	to	run.	And	that	yell	was	a	yell	of	fright.	There was	no	doubt	about	it,	for	with	the	yell	Farmer	Brown's	boy	turned	and	ran	for home,	as	no	one	ever	had	seen	him	run	before.	He	ran	just	as	Peter	Rabbit	runs when	he	has	got	to	reach	the	dear	Old	Briar-patch	before	Reddy	Fox	can	catch him,	which,	you	know,	is	as	fast	as	he	can	run.	Once	he	stumbled	and	fell,	but	he scrambled	to	his	feet	in	a	twinkling,	and	away	he	went	without	once	turning	his head	 to	 see	 if	 Buster	 Bear	 was	 after	 him.	 There	 wasn't	 any	 doubt	 that	 he	 was afraid,	very	much	afraid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everybody	leaned	forward	to	watch	him.	"What	did	I	tell	you?	Didn't	I	say	that he	 was	 afraid	 of	 Buster	 Bear?"	 cried	 Little	 Joe	 Otter,	 dancing	 about	 with excitement. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>"You	 were	 right,	 Little	 Joe!	 I'm	 sorry	 that	 I	 doubted	 it.	 See	 him	 go!	 Caw,	 caw, caw!"	shrieked	Blacky	the	Crow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	minute	or	two	everybody	forgot	about	Buster	Bear.	Then	there	was	a	great crash	which	made	everybody	turn	to	look	the	other	way.	What	do	you	think	they saw?	Why,	Buster	Bear	was	running	away	too,	and	he	was	running	twice	as	fast as	Farmer	Brown's	boy!	He	bumped	into	trees	and	crashed	through	bushes	and jumped	over	logs,	and	in	almost	no	time	at	all	he	was	out	of	sight.	Altogether	it was	the	most	surprising	thing	that	the	little	people	of	the	Green	Forest	ever	had seen. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Sammy	 Jay	 looked	 at	 Blacky	 the	 Crow,	 and	 Blacky	 looked	 at	 Chatterer,	 and Chatterer	 looked	 at	 Happy	 Jack,	 and	 Happy	 Jack	 looked	 at	 Peter	 Rabbit,	 and Peter	 looked	 at	 Unc'	 Billy	 Possum,	 and	 Unc'	 Billy	 looked	 at	 Bobby	 Coon,	 and Bobby	 looked	 at	 Johnny	 Chuck,	 and	 Johnny	 looked	 at	 Reddy	 Fox,	 and	 Reddy looked	 at	 Jimmy	 Skunk,	 and	 Jimmy	 looked	 at	 Billy	 Mink,	 and	 Billy	 looked	 at Little	Joe	Otter,	and	for	a	minute	nobody	could	say	a	word.	Then	Little	Joe	gave a	funny	little	gasp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why,	 why-e-e!"	 said	 he,	 "I	 believe	 Buster	 Bear	 is	 afraid	 too!"	 Unc'	 Billy Possum	 chuckled.	 "Ah	 believe	 yo'	 are	 right	 again,	 Brer	 Otter,"	 said	 he.	 "It cert'nly	 does	 look	 so.	 If	 Brer	 Bear	 isn't	 scared,	 he	 must	 have	 remembered something	impo'tant	and	has	gone	to	attend	to	it	in	a	powerful	hurry." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	everybody	began	to	laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="#p4">Contents</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a><b class="calibre3">XV</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">BUSTER	BEAR	IS	A	FALLEN	HERO</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A	fallen	hero	is	some	one	to	whom	every	one	has	looked	up	as	very	brave	and then	proves	to	be	less	brave	than	he	was	supposed	to	be.	That	was	the	way	with Buster	Bear.	When	Little	Joe	Otter	had	told	how	Farmer	Brown's	boy	had	been afraid	at	the	mere	sight	of	one	of	Buster	Bear's	big	footprints,	they	had	at	once made	a	hero	of	Buster.	At	least	some	of	them	had.	As	this	was	the	first	time,	the very	first	time,	that	they	had	ever	known	any	one	who	lives	in	the	Green	Forest to	make	Farmer	Brown's	boy	run	away,	they	looked	on	Buster	Bear	with	a	great deal	of	respect	and	were	very	proud	of	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	now	they	had	seen	Buster	Bear	and	Farmer	Brown's	boy	meet	face	to	face; and	while	it	was	true	that	Farmer	Brown's	boy	had	run	away	as	fast	as	ever	he could,	 it	 was	 also	 true	 that	 Buster	 Bear	 had	 done	 the	 same	 thing.	 He	 had	 run even	faster	than	Farmer	Brown's	boy,	and	had	hidden	in	the	most	lonely	place	he could	 find	 in	 the	 very	 deepest	 part	 of	 the	 Green	 Forest.	 It	 was	 hard	 to	 believe, but	 it	 was	 true.	 And	 right	 away	 everybody	 lost	 a	 great	 deal	 of	 the	 respect	 for Buster	 which	 they	 had	 felt.	 It	 is	 always	 that	 way.	 They	 began	 to	 say	 unkind things	 about	 him.	 They	 said	 them	 among	 themselves,	 and	 some	 of	 them	 even said	them	to	Buster	when	they	met	him,	or	said	them	so	that	he	would	hear	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	 course	 Blacky	 the	 Crow	 and	 Sammy	 Jay,	 who,	 because	 they	 can	 fly,	 have nothing	 to	 fear	 from	 Buster,	 and	 who	 always	 delight	 in	 making	 other	 people uncomfortable,	never	let	a	chance	go	by	to	tell	Buster	and	everybody	else	within hearing	 what	 they	 thought	 of	 him.	 They	 delighted	 in	 flying	 about	 through	 the Green	 Forest	 until	 they	 had	 found	 Buster	 Bear	 and	 then	 from	 the	 safety	 of	 the tree	tops	screaming	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Buster	Bear	is	big	and	strong; </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	teeth	are	big;	his	claws	are	long; </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	spite	of	these	he	runs	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">And	hides	himself	the	livelong	day!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	dozen	times	a	day	Buster	would	hear	them	screaming	this.	He	would	grind	his teeth	and	glare	up	at	them,	but	that	was	all	he	could	do.	He	couldn't	get	at	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>He	 just	 had	 to	 stand	 it	 and	 do	 nothing.	 But	 when	 impudent	 little	 Chatterer	 the Red	Squirrel	shouted	the	same	thing	from	a	place	just	out	of	reach	in	a	big	pine-tree,	Buster	could	stand	it	no	longer.	He	gave	a	deep,	angry	growl	that	made	little shivers	 run	 over	 Chatterer,	 and	 then	 suddenly	 he	 started	 up	 that	 tree	 after Chatterer.	 With	 a	 frightened	 little	 shriek	 Chatterer	 scampered	 to	 the	 top	 of	 the tree.	He	hadn't	known	that	Buster	could	climb.	But	Buster	is	a	splendid	climber, especially	 when	 the	 tree	 is	 big	 and	 stout	 as	 this	 one	 was,	 and	 now	 he	 went	 up after	Chatterer,	growling	angrily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	Chatterer	did	wish	that	he	had	kept	his	tongue	still!	He	ran	to	the	very	top of	the	tree,	so	frightened	that	his	teeth	chattered,	and	when	he	looked	down	and saw	 Buster's	 great	 mouth	 coming	 nearer	 and	 nearer,	 he	 nearly	 tumbled	 down with	terror.	The	worst	of	it	was	there	wasn't	another	tree	near	enough	for	him	to jump	to.	He	was	in	trouble	this	time,	was	Chatterer,	sure	enough!	And	there	was no	one	to	help	him. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">CHATTERER	THE	RED	SQUIRREL	JUMPS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">FOR	HIS	LIFE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It	isn't	very	often	that	Chatterer	the	Red	Squirrel	knows	fear.	That	is	one	reason that	 he	 is	 so	 often	 impudent	 and	 saucy.	 But	 once	 in	 a	 while	 a	 great	 fear	 takes possession	of	him,	as	when	he	knows	that	Shadow	the	Weasel	is	looking	for	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	see,	he	knows	that	Shadow	can	go	wherever	he	can	go.	There	are	very	few of	 the	 little	 people	 of	 the	 Green	 Forest	 and	 the	 Green	 Meadows	 who	 do	 not know	fear	at	some	time	or	other,	but	it	comes	to	Chatterer	as	seldom	as	to	any one,	because	he	is	very	sure	of	himself	and	his	ability	to	hide	or	run	away	from danger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	now	as	he	clung	to	a	little	branch	near	the	top	of	a	tall	pine-tree	in	the	Green Forest	and	looked	down	at	the	big	sharp	teeth	of	Buster	Bear	drawing	nearer	and nearer,	 and	 listened	 to	 the	 deep,	 angry	 growls	 that	 made	 his	 hair	 stand	 on	 end, Chatterer	was	too	frightened	to	think.	If	only	he	had	kept	his	tongue	still	instead of	saying	hateful	things	to	Buster	Bear!	If	only	he	had	known	that	Buster	could climb	a	tree!	If	only	he	had	chosen	a	tree	near	enough	to	other	trees	for	him	to jump	across!	But	he	 <i class="calibre4">had</i>	said	hateful	things,	he	 <i class="calibre4">had</i>	chosen	to	sit	in	a	tree	which stood	 quite	 by	 itself,	 and	 Buster	 Bear	  <i class="calibre4">could</i>	 climb!	 Chatterer	 was	 in	 the	 worst kind	of	trouble,	and	there	was	no	one	to	blame	but	himself.	That	is	usually	the case	with	those	who	get	into	trouble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nearer	and	nearer	came	Buster	Bear,	and	deeper	and	angrier	sounded	his	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chatterer	gave	a	little	frightened	gasp	and	looked	this	way	and	looked	that	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	 should	 he	 do?	 What	  <i class="calibre4">could</i>	 he	 do!	 The	 ground	 seemed	 a	 terrible	 distance below.	If	only	he	had	wings	like	Sammy	Jay!	But	he	hadn't. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gr-r-r-r!"	 growled	 Buster	 Bear.	 "I'll	 teach	 you	 manners!	 I'll	 teach	 you	 to	 treat your	betters	with	respect!	I'll	swallow	you	whole,	that's	what	I'll	do.	Gr-r-r-r!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh!"	cried	Chatterer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gr-r-r-r!	 I'll	 eat	 you	 all	 up	 to	 the	 last	 hair	 on	 your	 tail!"	 growled	 Buster, scrambling	a	little	nearer. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>"Oh!	 Oh!"	 cried	 Chatterer,	 and	 ran	 out	 to	 the	 very	 tip	 of	 the	 little	 branch	 to which	 he	 had	 been	 clinging.	 Now	 if	 Chatterer	 had	 only	 known	 it,	 Buster	 Bear couldn't	 reach	 him	 way	 up	 there,	 because	 the	 tree	 was	 too	 small	 at	 the	 top	 for such	a	big	fellow	as	Buster.	But	Chatterer	didn't	think	of	that.	He	gave	one	more frightened	 look	 down	 at	 those	 big	 teeth,	 then	 he	 shut	 his	 eyes	 and	 jumped—</p>
<p class="calibre1">jumped	straight	out	for	the	far-away	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	a	long,	long,	long	way	down	to	the	ground,	and	it	certainly	looked	as	if such	a	little	fellow	as	Chatterer	must	be	killed.	But	Chatterer	had	learned	from Old	Mother	Nature	that	she	had	given	him	certain	things	to	help	him	at	just	such times,	and	one	of	them	is	the	power	to	spread	himself	very	flat.	He	did	it	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	spread	his	arms	and	legs	out	just	as	far	as	he	could,	and	that	kept	him	from falling	 as	 fast	 and	 as	 hard	 as	 he	 otherwise	 would	 have	 done,	 because	 being spread	out	 so	 flat	that	 way,	 the	air	 held	 him	 up	a	 little.	 And	then	 there	 was	his tail,	that	funny	little	tail	he	is	so	fond	of	jerking	when	he	scolds.	This	helped	him too.	It	helped	him	keep	his	balance	and	keep	from	turning	over	and	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Down,	down,	down	he	sailed	and	landed	on	his	feet.	Of	course,	he	hit	the	ground pretty	hard,	and	for	just	a	second	he	quite	lost	his	breath.	But	it	was	only	for	a second,	 and	 then	 he	 was	 scurrying	 off	 as	 fast	 as	 a	 frightened	 Squirrel	 could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Buster	Bear	watched	him	and	grinned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	didn't	catch	him	that	time,"	he	growled,	"but	I	guess	I	gave	him	a	good	fright and	taught	him	a	lesson." </p>

<p class="calibre1">Now	Buster	Bear	had	lived	by	himself	in	the	Great	Woods	so	long	that	this	habit of	 talking	 to	 himself	 had	 grown	 and	 grown.	 He	 did	 it	 just	 to	 keep	 from	 being lonesome.	Of	course,	when	he	came	down	to	the	Green	Forest	to	live,	he	brought all	 his	 habits	 with	 him.	 That	 is	 one	 thing	 about	 habits,—you	 always	 take	 them with	 you	 wherever	 you	 go.	 So	 Buster	 brought	 this	 habit	 of	 talking	 to	 himself down	to	the	Green	Forest,	where	he	had	many	more	neighbors	than	he	had	in	the Great	Woods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let	me	see,	let	me	see,	what	is	there	to	tempt	my	appetite?"	said	Buster	in	his deep,	grumbly-rumbly	voice.	"I	find	my	appetite	isn't	what	it	ought	to	be.	I	need a	 change.	 Yes,	 Sir,	 I	 need	 a	 change.	 There	 is	 something	 I	 ought	to	have	at	this time	of	year,	and	I	haven't	got	it.	There	is	something	that	I	used	to	have	and	don't have	now.	Ha!	I	know!	I	need	some	fresh	fruit.	That's	it—fresh	fruit!	It	must	be about	berry	time	now,	and	I'd	forgotten	all	about	it.	My,	my,	my,	how	good	some berries	 would	 taste!	 Now	 if	 I	 were	 back	 up	 there	 in	 the	 Great	 Woods	 I	 could have	 all	 I	 could	 eat.	 Um-m-m-m!	 Makes	 my	 mouth	 water	 just	 to	 think	 of	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	ought	to	be	some	up	in	the	Old	Pasture.	There	ought	to	be	a	lot	of	'em	up there.	If	I	wasn't	afraid	that	some	one	would	see	me,	I'd	go	up	there." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Buster	sighed.	Then	he	sighed	again.	The	more	he	thought	about	those	berries	he felt	sure	were	growing	in	the	Old	Pasture,	the	more	he	wanted	some.	It	seemed to	 him	 that	 never	 in	 all	 his	 life	 had	 he	 wanted	 berries	 as	 he	 did	 now.	 He wandered	about	uneasily.	He	was	hungry—hungry	for	berries	and	nothing	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	and	by	he	began	talking	to	himself	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>"If	I	wasn't	afraid	of	being	seen,	I'd	go	up	to	the	Old	Pasture	this	very	minute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seems	as	if	I	could	taste	those	berries."	He	licked	his	lips	hungrily	as	he	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	his	face	brightened.	"I	know	what	I'll	do!	I'll	go	up	there	at	the	very	first peep	 of	 day	 to-morrow.	 I	 can	 eat	 all	 I	 want	 and	 get	 back	 to	 the	 Green	 Forest before	there	is	any	danger	that	Farmer	Brown's	boy	or	any	one	else	I'm	afraid	of will	see	me.	That's	just	what	I'll	do.	My,	I	wish	to-morrow	morning	would	hurry up	and	come." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	though	Buster	didn't	know	it,	some	one	had	been	listening,	and	that	some one	 was	 none	 other	 than	 Sammy	 Jay.	 When	 at	 last	 Buster	 lay	 down	 for	 a	 nap, Sammy	flew	away,	chuckling	to	himself.	"I	believe	I'll	visit	the	Old	Pasture	to-morrow	morning	myself,"	thought	he.	"I	have	an	idea	that	something	interesting may	happen	if	Buster	doesn't	change	his	mind." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sammy	 was	 on	 the	 lookout	 very	 early	 the	 next	 morning.	 The	 first	 Jolly	 Little Sunbeams	 had	 only	 reached	 the	 Green	 Meadows	 and	 had	 not	 started	 to	 creep into	the	Green	Forest,	when	he	saw	a	big,	dark	form	steal	out	of	the	Green	Forest where	it	joins	the	Old	Pasture.	It	moved	very	swiftly	and	silently,	as	if	in	a	great hurry.	Sammy	knew	who	it	was:	it	was	Buster	Bear,	and	he	was	going	berrying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sammy	waited	a	little	until	he	could	see	better.	Then	he	too	started	for	the	Old Pasture. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="#p4">Contents</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a><b class="calibre3">XVIII</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">SOMEBODY	ELSE	GOES	BERRYING</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Isn't	it	funny	how	two	people	will	often	think	of	the	same	thing	at	the	same	time, and	neither	one	know	that	the	other	is	thinking	of	it?	That	is	just	what	happened the	day	that	Buster	Bear	first	thought	of	going	berrying.	While	he	was	walking around	 in	 the	 Green	 Forest,	 talking	 to	 himself	 about	 how	 hungry	 he	 was	 for some	berries	and	how	sure	he	was	that	there	must	be	some	up	in	the	Old	Pasture, some	one	else	was	thinking	about	berries	and	about	the	Old	Pasture	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Will	 you	 make	 me	 a	 berry	 pie	 if	 I	 will	 get	 the	 berries	 to-morrow?"	 asked Farmer	Brown's	boy	of	his	mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	 course	 Mrs.	 Brown	 promised	 that	 she	 would,	 and	 so	 that	 night	 Farmer Brown's	boy	went	to	bed	very	early	that	he	might	get	up	early	in	the	morning, and	 all	 night	 long	 he	 dreamed	 of	 berries	 and	 berry	 pies.	 He	 was	 awake	 even before	 jolly,	 round,	 red	 Mr.	 Sun	 thought	 it	 was	 time	 to	 get	 up,	 and	 he	 was	 all ready	 to	 start	 for	 the	 Old	 Pasture	 when	 the	 first	 Jolly	 Little	 Sunbeams	 came dancing	across	the	Green	Meadows.	He	carried	a	big	tin	pail,	and	in	the	bottom of	it,	wrapped	up	in	a	piece	of	paper,	was	a	lunch,	for	he	meant	to	stay	until	he filled	that	pail,	if	it	took	all	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	 the	 Old	 Pasture	 is	 very	 large.	 It	 lies	 at	 the	 foot	 of	 the	 Big	 Mountain,	 and even	extends	a	little	way	up	on	the	Big	Mountain.	There	is	room	in	it	for	many people	to	pick	berries	all	day	without	even	seeing	each	other,	unless	 they	 roam about	a	great	deal.	You	see,	the	bushes	grow	very	thick	there,	and	you	cannot	see very	far	in	any	direction.	Jolly,	round,	red	Mr.	Sun	had	climbed	a	little	way	up	in the	 sky	 by	 the	 time	 Farmer	 Brown's	 boy	 reached	 the	 Old	 Pasture,	 and	 was smiling	 down	 on	 all	 the	 Great	 World,	 and	 all	 the	 Great	 World	 seemed	 to	 be smiling	back.	Farmer	Brown's	boy	started	to	whistle,	and	then	he	stopped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	I	whistle,"	thought	he,	"everybody	will	know	just	where	I	am,	and	will	keep out	of	sight,	and	I	never	can	get	acquainted	with	folks	if	they	keep	out	of	sight." </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	 see,	 Farmer	 Brown's	 boy	 was	 just	 beginning	 to	 understand	 something	 that Peter	 Rabbit	 and	 the	 other	 little	 people	 of	 the	 Green	 Meadows	 and	 the	 Green Forest	learned	almost	as	soon	as	they	learned	to	walk,—that	if	you	don't	want	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>be	seen,	you	mustn't	be	heard.	So	he	didn't	whistle	as	he	felt	like	doing,	and	he tried	not	to	make	a	bit	of	noise	as	he	followed	an	old	cow-path	towards	a	place where	he	knew	the	berries	grew	thick	and	oh,	so	big,	and	all	the	time	he	kept	his eyes	wide	open,	and	he	kept	his	ears	open	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	is	how	he	happened	to	hear	a	little	cry,	a	very	faint	little	cry.	If	he	had	been whistling,	 he	 wouldn't	 have	 heard	 it	 at	 all.	 He	 stopped	 to	 listen.	 He	 never	 had heard	a	cry	just	like	it	before.	At	first	he	couldn't	make	out	just	what	it	was	or where	it	came	from.	But	one	thing	he	was	sure	of,	and	that	was	that	it	was	a	cry of	 fright.	 He	 stood	 perfectly	 still	 and	 listened	 with	 all	 his	 might.	 There	 it	 was again—"Help!	 Help!	 Help"—and	 it	 was	 very	 faint	 and	 sounded	 terribly frightened.	 He	 waited	 a	 minute	 or	 two,	 but	 heard	 nothing	 more.	 Then	 he	 put down	his	pail	and	began	a	hurried	look	here,	there,	and	everywhere.	He	was	sure that	it	had	come	from	somewhere	on	the	ground,	so	he	peered	behind	bushes	and peeped	behind	logs	and	stones,	and	then	just	as	he	had	about	given	up	hope	of finding	where	it	came	from,	he	went	around	a	little	turn	in	the	old	cow-path,	and there	right	in	front	of	him	was	little	Mr.	Gartersnake,	and	what	do	you	think	he was	doing?	Well,	I	don't	like	to	tell	you,	but	he	was	trying	to	swallow	one	of	the children	 of	 Stickytoes	 the	 Tree	 Toad.	 Of	 course	 Farmer	 Brown's	 Boy	 didn't	 let him.	 He	 made	 little	 Mr.	 Gartersnake	 set	 Master	 Stickytoes	 free	 and	 held	 Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gartersnake	until	Master	Stickytoes	was	safely	out	of	reach. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a><b class="calibre3">XIX</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">BUSTER	BEAR	HAS	A	FINE	TIME</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Buster	Bear	was	having	the	finest	time	he	had	had	since	he	came	down	from	the Great	 Woods	 to	 live	 in	 the	 Green	 Forest.	 To	 be	 sure,	 he	 wasn't	 in	 the	 Green Forest	 now,	 but	 he	 wasn't	 far	 from	 it.	 He	 was	 in	 the	 Old	 Pasture,	 one	 edge	 of which	touches	one	edge	of	the	Green	Forest.	And	where	do	you	think	he	was,	in the	 Old	 Pasture?	 Why,	 right	 in	 the	 middle	 of	 the	 biggest	 patch	 of	 the	 biggest blueberries	 he	 ever	 had	 seen	 in	 all	 his	 life!	 Now	 if	 there	 is	 any	 one	 thing	 that Buster	Bear	had	rather	have	above	another,	it	is	all	the	berries	he	can	eat,	unless it	be	honey.	Nothing	can	quite	equal	honey	in	Buster's	mind.	But	next	to	honey give	 him	 berries.	 He	 isn't	 particular	 what	 kind	 of	 berries.	 Raspberries, blackberries,	or	blueberries,	either	kind,	will	make	him	perfectly	happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Um-m-m,	 my,	 my,	 but	 these	 are	 good!"	 he	 mumbled	 in	 his	 deep	 grumbly-rumbly	 voice,	 as	 he	 sat	 on	 his	 haunches	 stripping	 off	 the	 berries	 greedily.	 His little	eyes	twinkled	with	enjoyment,	and	he	didn't	mind	at	all	if	now	and	then	he got	 leaves,	 and	 some	 green	 berries	 in	 his	 mouth	 with	 the	 big	 ripe	 berries.	 He didn't	try	to	get	them	out.	Oh,	my,	no!	He	just	chomped	them	all	up	together	and patted	his	stomach	from	sheer	delight.	Now	Buster	had	reached	the	Old	Pasture just	as	jolly,	round,	red	Mr.	Sun	had	crept	out	of	bed,	and	he	had	fully	made	up his	mind	that	he	would	be	back	in	the	Green	Forest	before	Mr.	Sun	had	climbed very	far	up	in	the	blue,	blue	sky.	You	see,	big	as	he	is	and	strong	as	he	is,	Buster Bear	 is	 very	 shy	 and	 bashful,	 and	 he	 has	 no	 desire	 to	 meet	 Farmer	 Brown,	 or Farmer	 Brown's	 boy,	 or	 any	 other	 of	 those	 two-legged	 creatures	 called	 men.	 It seems	funny	but	he	actually	is	afraid	of	them.	And	he	had	a	feeling	that	he	was	a great	deal	more	likely	to	meet	one	of	them	in	the	Old	Pasture	than	deep	in	the Green	Forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	 when	 he	 started	 to	 look	 for	 berries,	 he	 made	 up	 his	 mind	 that	 he	 would	 eat what	he	could	in	a	great	hurry	and	get	back	to	the	Green	Forest	before	Farmer Brown's	boy	was	more	than	out	of	bed.	But	when	he	found	those	berries	he	was so	hungry	that	he	forgot	his	fears	and	everything	else.	They	tasted	so	good	that he	just	had	to	eat	and	eat	and	eat.	Now	you	know	that	Buster	is	a	very	big	fellow, and	 it	 takes	 a	 lot	 to	 fill	 him	 up.	 He	 kept	 eating	 and	 eating	 and	 eating,	 and	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>more	he	ate	the	more	he	wanted.	You	know	how	it	is.	So	he	wandered	from	one patch	 of	 berries	 to	 another	 in	 the	 Old	 Pasture,	 and	 never	 once	 thought	 of	 the time.	 Somehow,	 time	 is	 the	 hardest	 thing	 in	 the	 world	 to	 remember,	 when	 you are	having	a	good	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jolly,	 round,	 red	 Mr.	 Sun	 climbed	 higher	 and	 higher	 in	 the	 blue,	 blue	 sky.	 He looked	 down	 on	 all	 the	 Great	 World	 and	 saw	 all	 that	 was	 going	 on.	 He	 saw Buster	Bear	in	the	Old	Pasture,	and	smiled	as	he	saw	what	a	perfectly	glorious time	Buster	was	having.	And	he	saw	something	else	in	the	Old	Pasture	that	made his	 smile	 still	 broader.	 He	 saw	 Farmer	 Brown's	 boy	 filling	 a	 great	 tin	 pail	 with blueberries,	and	he	knew	that	Farmer	Brown's	boy	didn't	know	that	Buster	Bear was	 anywhere	 about,	 and	 he	 knew	 that	 Buster	 Bear	 didn't	 know	 that	 Farmer Brown's	boy	was	anywhere	about,	and	somehow	he	felt	very	sure	that	he	would see	something	funny	happen	if	they	should	chance	to	meet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Um-m-m,	 um-m-m,"	 mumbled	 Buster	 Bear	 with	 his	 mouth	 full,	 as	 he	 moved along	to	another	patch	of	berries.	And	then	he	gave	a	little	gasp	of	surprise	and delight.	 Right	 in	 front	 of	 him	 was	 a	 shiny	 thing	 just	 full	 of	 the	 finest,	 biggest, bluest	 berries!	 There	 were	 no	 leaves	 or	 green	 ones	 there.	 Buster	 blinked	 his greedy	little	eyes	rapidly	and	looked	again.	No,	he	wasn't	dreaming.	They	were real	berries,	and	all	he	had	got	to	do	was	to	help	himself.	Buster	looked	sharply at	the	shiny	thing	that	held	the	berries.	It	seemed	perfectly	harmless.	He	reached out	 a	 big	 paw	 and	 pushed	 it	 gently.	 It	 tipped	 over	 and	 spilled	 out	 a	 lot	 of	 the berries.	 Yes,	 it	 was	 perfectly	 harmless.	 Buster	 gave	 a	 little	 sigh	 of	 pure happiness.	 He	 would	 eat	 those	 berries	 to	 the	 last	 one,	 and	 then	 he	 would	 go home	to	the	Green	Forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="#p4">Contents</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a><b class="calibre3">XX</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">BUSTER	BEAR	CARRIES	OFF	THE	PAIL</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">OF	FARMER	BROWN'S	BOY</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	question	is,	did	Buster	Bear	steal	Farmer	Brown's	boy's	pail?	To	steal	is	to take	something	which	belongs	to	some	one	else.	There	is	no	doubt	that	he	stole the	berries	that	were	in	the	pail	when	he	found	it,	for	he	deliberately	ate	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	knew	well	enough	that	some	one	must	have	picked	them—for	whoever	heard of	blueberries	growing	in	tin	pails?	So	there	is	no	doubt	that	when	Buster	took them,	he	stole	them.	But	with	the	pail	it	was	different.	He	took	the	pail,	but	he didn't	mean	to	take	it.	In	fact,	he	didn't	want	that	pail	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	 see	 it	 was	 this	 way:	 When	 Buster	 found	 that	 big	 tin	 pail	 brimming	 full	 of delicious	berries	in	the	shade	of	that	big	bush	in	the	Old	Pasture,	he	didn't	stop	to think	whether	or	not	he	had	a	right	to	them.	Buster	is	so	fond	of	berries	that	from the	very	second	that	his	greedy	little	eyes	saw	that	pailful,	he	forgot	everything but	the	feast	that	was	waiting	for	him	right	under	his	very	nose.	He	didn't	think anything	 about	 the	 right	 or	 wrong	 of	 helping	 himself.	 There	 before	 him	 were more	berries	than	he	had	ever	seen	together	at	one	time	in	all	his	life,	and	all	he had	to	do	was	to	eat	and	eat	and	eat.	And	that	is	just	what	he	did	do.	Of	course he	upset	the	pail,	but	he	didn't	mind	a	little	thing	like	that.	When	he	had	gobbled up	 all	 the	 berries	 that	 rolled	 out,	 he	 thrust	 his	 nose	 into	 the	 pail	 to	 get	 all	 that were	left	in	it.	Just	then	he	heard	a	little	noise,	as	if	some	one	were	coming.	He threw	 up	 his	 head	 to	 listen,	 and	 somehow,	 he	 never	 did	 know	 just	 how,	 the handle	of	the	pail	slipped	back	over	his	ears	and	caught	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 was	 bad	 enough,	 but	 to	 make	 matters	 worse,	 just	 at	 that	 very	 minute	 he heard	a	shrill,	angry	voice	shout,	"Hi,	there!	Get	out	of	there!"	He	didn't	need	to be	told	whose	voice	that	was.	It	was	the	voice	of	Farmer	Brown's	boy.	Right	then and	 there	 Buster	 Bear	 nearly	 had	 a	 fit.	 There	 was	 that	 awful	 pail	 fast	 over	 his head	 so	 that	 he	 couldn't	 see	 a	 thing.	 Of	 course,	 that	 meant	 that	 he	 couldn't	 run away,	which	was	the	thing	of	all	things	he	most	wanted	to	do,	for	big	as	he	is	and strong	as	he	is,	Buster	is	very	shy	and	bashful	when	human	beings	are	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 growled	 and	 whined	 and	 squealed.	 He	 tried	 to	 back	 out	 of	 the	 pail	 and couldn't.	He	tried	to	shake	it	off	and	couldn't.	He	tried	to	pull	it	off,	but	somehow</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>he	couldn't	get	hold	of	it.	Then	there	was	another	yell.	If	Buster	hadn't	been	so frightened	 himself,	 he	 might	 have	 recognized	 that	 second	 yell	 as	 one	 of	 fright, for	that	is	what	it	was.	You	see	Farmer	Brown's	boy	had	just	discovered	Buster Bear.	When	he	had	yelled	the	first	time,	he	had	supposed	that	it	was	one	of	the young	cattle	who	live	in	the	Old	Pasture	all	summer,	but	when	he	saw	Buster,	he was	just	as	badly	frightened	as	Buster	himself.	In	fact,	he	was	too	surprised	and frightened	even	to	run.	After	that	second	yell	he	just	stood	still	and	stared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Buster	 clawed	 at	 that	 awful	 thing	 on	 his	 head	 more	 frantically	 than	 ever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly	 it	 slipped	 off,	 so	 that	 he	 could	 see.	 He	 gave	 one	 frightened	 look	 at Farmer	 Brown's	 boy,	 and	 then	 with	 a	 mighty	 "Woof!"	 he	 started	 for	 the	 Green Forest	as	fast	as	his	legs	could	take	him,	and	this	was	very	fast	indeed,	let	me	tell you.	He	didn't	stop	to	pick	out	a	path,	but	just	crashed	through	the	bushes	as	if they	were	nothing	at	all,	just	nothing	at	all.	But	the	funniest	thing	of	all	is	this—</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	took	that	pail	with	him!	Yes,	Sir,	Buster	Bear	ran	away	with	the	big	tin	pail	of Farmer	Brown's	boy!	You	see	when	it	slipped	off	his	head,	the	handle	was	still around	 his	 neck,	 and	 there	 he	 was	 running	 away	 with	 a	 pail	 hanging	 from	 his neck!	 He	 didn't	 want	 it.	 He	 would	 have	 given	 anything	 to	 get	 rid	 of	 it.	 But	 he took	it	because	he	couldn't	help	it.	And	that	brings	us	back	to	the	question,	did Buster	steal	Farmer	Brown's	boy's	pail?	What	do	you	think? </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">SAMMY	JAY	MAKES	THINGS	WORSE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">FOR	BUSTER	BEAR</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thief,	thief,	thief!	Thief,	thief,	thief!"	Sammy	Jay	was	screaming	at	the	top	of his	lungs,	as	he	followed	Buster	Bear	across	the	Old	Pasture	towards	the	Green Forest.	 Never	 had	 he	 screamed	 so	 loud,	 and	 never	 had	 his	 voice	 sounded	 so excited.	 The	 little	 people	 of	 the	 Green	 Forest,	 the	 Green	 Meadows,	 and	 the Smiling	Pool	are	so	used	to	hearing	Sammy	cry	thief	that	usually	they	think	very little	 about	 it.	 But	 every	 blessed	 one	 who	 heard	 Sammy	 this	 morning	 stopped whatever	he	was	doing	and	pricked	up	his	ears	to	listen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sammy's	cousin,	Blacky	the	Crow,	just	happened	to	be	flying	along	the	edge	of the	 Old	 Pasture,	 and	 the	 minute	 he	 heard	 Sammy's	 voice,	 he	 turned	 and	 flew over	to	see	what	it	was	all	about.	Just	as	soon	as	he	caught	sight	of	Buster	Bear running	for	the	Green	Forest	as	hard	as	ever	he	could,	he	understood	what	had excited	Sammy	so.	He	was	so	surprised	that	he	almost	forgot	to	keep	his	wings moving.	 Buster	 Bear	 had	 what	 looked	 to	 Blacky	 very	 much	 like	 a	 tin	 pail hanging	from	his	neck!	No	wonder	Sammy	was	excited.	Blacky	beat	his	wings fiercely	and	started	after	Sammy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	so	they	reached	the	edge	of	the	Green	Forest,	Buster	Bear	running	as	hard as	ever	he	could,	Sammy	Jay	flying	just	behind	him	and	screaming,	"Thief,	thief, thief!"	at	the	top	of	his	lungs,	and	behind	him	Blacky	the	Crow,	trying	to	catch up	and	yelling	as	loud	as	he	could,	"Caw,	caw,	caw!	Come	on,	everybody!	Come on!	Come	on!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poor	Buster!	It	was	bad	enough	to	be	frightened	almost	to	death	as	he	had	been up	 in	 the	 Old	 Pasture	 when	 the	 pail	 had	 caught	 over	 his	 head	 just	 as	 Farmer Brown's	 boy	 had	 yelled	 at	 him.	 Then	 to	 have	 the	 handle	 of	 the	 pail	 slip	 down around	his	neck	so	that	he	couldn't	get	rid	of	the	pail	but	had	to	take	it	with	him as	he	ran,	was	making	a	bad	matter	worse.	Now	to	have	all	his	neighbors	of	the Green	Forest	see	him	in	such	a	fix	and	make	fun	of	him,	was	more	than	he	could stand.	 He	 felt	 humiliated.	 That	 is	 just	 another	 way	 of	 saying	 shamed.	 Yes,	 Sir, Buster	 felt	 that	 he	 was	 shamed	 in	 the	 eyes	 of	 his	 neighbors,	 and	 he	 wanted nothing	so	much	as	to	get	away	by	himself,	where	no	one	could	see	him,	and	try</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>to	get	rid	of	that	dreadful	pail.	But	Buster	is	so	big	that	it	is	not	easy	for	him	to find	a	hiding	place.	So,	when	he	reached	the	Green	Forest,	he	kept	right	on	to	the deepest,	 darkest,	 most	 lonesome	 part	 and	 crept	 under	 the	 thickest	 hemlock-tree he	could	find. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 it	 was	 of	 no	 use.	 The	 sharp	 eyes	 of	 Sammy	 Jay	 and	 Blacky	 the	 Crow	 saw him.	They	actually	flew	into	the	very	tree	under	which	he	was	hiding,	and	how they	did	scream!	Pretty	soon	Ol'	Mistah	Buzzard	came	dropping	down	out	of	the blue,	blue	sky	and	took	a	seat	on	a	convenient	dead	tree,	where	he	could	see	all that	went	on.	Ol'	Mistah	Buzzard	began	to	grin	as	soon	as	he	saw	that	tin	pail	on Buster's	 neck.	 Then	 came	 others,—Redtail	 the	 Hawk,	 Scrapper	 the	 Kingbird, Redwing	the	Blackbird,	Drummer	the	Woodpecker,	Welcome	Robin,	Tommy	Tit the	 Chickadee,	 Jenny	 Wren,	 Redeye	 the	 Vireo,	 and	 ever	 so	 many	 more.	 They came	from	the	Old	Orchard,	the	Green	Meadows,	and	even	down	by	the	Smiling Pool,	for	the	voices	of	Sammy	Jay	and	Blacky	the	Crow	carried	far,	and	at	the sound	 of	 them	 everybody	 hurried	 over,	 sure	 that	 something	 exciting	 was	 going on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Presently	Buster	heard	light	footsteps,	and	peeping	out,	he	saw	Billy	Mink	and Peter	Rabbit	and	Jumper	the	Hare	and	Prickly	Porky	and	Reddy	Fox	and	Jimmy Skunk.	 Even	 timid	 little	 Whitefoot	 the	 Wood	 Mouse	 was	 where	 he	 could	 peer out	and	see	without	being	seen.	Of	course,	Chatterer	the	Red	Squirrel	and	Happy Jack	the	Gray	Squirrel	were	there.	There	they	all	sat	in	a	great	circle	around	him, each	where	he	felt	safe,	but	where	he	could	see,	and	every	one	of	them	laughing and	making	fun	of	Buster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thief,	thief,	thief!"	screamed	Sammy	until	his	throat	was	sore.	The	worst	of	it was	Buster	knew	that	everybody	knew	that	it	was	true.	That	awful	pail	was	proof of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I	wish	I	never	had	thought	of	berries,"	growled	Buster	to	himself. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">BUSTER	BEAR	HAS	A	FIT	OF	TEMPER</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>A	temper	is	a	bad,	bad	thing</p>
<p class="calibre1">When	once	it	gets	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There's	nothing	quite	at	all	like	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">To	spoil	a	pleasant	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Buster	Bear	was	in	a	terrible	temper.	Yes,	Sir,	Buster	Bear	was	having	the	worst fit	of	temper	ever	seen	in	the	Green	Forest.	And	the	worst	part	of	it	all	was	that all	his	neighbors	of	the	Green	Forest	and	a	whole	lot	from	the	Green	Meadows and	the	 Smiling	 Pool	were	 also	 there	to	 see	 it.	 It	is	 bad	 enough	to	 give	 way	 to temper	when	you	are	all	alone,	and	there	is	no	one	to	watch	you,	but	when	you let	 temper	 get	 the	 best	 of	 you	 right	 where	 others	 see	 you,	 oh,	 dear,	 dear,	 it certainly	is	a	sorry	sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	ordinarily	Buster	is	one	of	the	most	good-natured	persons	in	the	world.	It takes	 a	 great	 deal	 to	 rouse	 his	 temper.	 He	 isn't	 one	 tenth	 so	 quick	 tempered	 as Chatterer	the	Red	Squirrel,	or	Sammy	Jay,	or	Reddy	Fox.	But	when	his	temper	is aroused	and	gets	away	from	him,	then	watch	out!	It	seemed	to	Buster	that	he	had had	all	that	he	could	stand	that	day	and	a	little	more.	First	had	come	the	fright back	 there	 in	 the	 Old	 Pasture.	 Then	 the	 pail	 had	 slipped	 down	 behind	 his	 ears and	held	fast,	so	he	had	run	all	the	way	to	the	Green	Forest	with	it	hanging	about his	neck.	This	was	bad	enough,	for	he	knew	just	how	funny	he	must	look,	and besides,	 it	 was	 very	 uncomfortable.	 But	 to	 have	 Sammy	 Jay	 call	 everybody within	hearing	to	come	and	see	him	was	more	than	he	could	stand.	It	seemed	to Buster	as	if	everybody	who	lives	in	the	Green	Forest,	on	the	Green	Meadows,	or around	 the	 Smiling	 Brook,	 was	 sitting	 around	 his	 hiding	 place,	 laughing	 and making	fun	of	him.	It	was	more	than	any	self-respecting	Bear	could	stand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	a	roar	of	anger	Buster	Bear	charged	out	of	his	hiding	place.	He	rushed	this way	 and	 that	 way!	 He	 roared	 with	 all	 his	 might!	 He	 was	 very	 terrible	 to	 see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those	 who	 could	 fly,	 flew.	 Those	 who	 could	 climb,	 climbed.	 And	 those	 who were	swift	of	foot,	ran.	A	few	who	could	neither	fly	nor	climb	nor	run	fast,	hid and	lay	shaking	and	trembling	for	fear	that	Buster	would	find	them.	In	less	time than	it	takes	to	tell	about	it,	Buster	was	alone.	At	least,	he	couldn't	see	any	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="#p6">Illus	</a>Those	who	could	fly,	flew.	Those	who	could	climb,	climbed. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Those	who	could	fly,	flew.	Those	who	could</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">climb,	climbed.  <i class="calibre4">Page	112. </i></b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>Then	he	vented	his	temper	on	the	tin	pail.	He	cuffed	at	it	and	pulled	at	it,	all	the time	growling	angrily.	He	lay	down	and	clawed	at	it	with	his	hind	feet.	At	last the	 handle	 broke,	 and	 he	 was	 free!	 He	 shook	 himself.	 Then	 he	 jumped	 on	 the helpless	 pail.	 With	 a	 blow	 of	 a	 big	 paw	 he	 sent	 it	 clattering	 against	 a	 tree.	 He tried	to	bite	it.	Then	he	once	more	fell	to	knocking	it	this	way	and	that	way,	until it	was	pounded	flat,	and	no	one	would	ever	have	guessed	that	it	had	once	been	a pail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	and	not	till	then,	did	Buster	recover	his	usual	good	nature.	Little	by	little, as	he	thought	it	all	over,	a	look	of	shame	crept	into	his	face.	"I—I	guess	it	wasn't the	fault	of	that	thing.	I	ought	to	have	known	enough	to	keep	my	head	out	of	it," </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	said	slowly	and	thoughtfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	got	no	more	than	you	deserve	for	stealing	Farmer	Brown's	boy's	berries," </p>
<p class="calibre1">said	Sammy	Jay,	who	had	come	back	and	was	looking	on	from	the	top	of	a	tree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You	ought	to	know	by	this	time	that	no	good	comes	of	stealing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Buster	 Bear	 looked	 up	 and	 grinned,	 and	 there	 was	 a	 twinkle	 in	 his	 eyes.	 "You ought	to	know,	Sammy	Jay,"	said	he.	"I	hope	you'll	always	remember	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thief,	thief,	thief!"	screamed	Sammy,	and	flew	away. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">FARMER	BROWN'S	BOY	LUNCHES	ON</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">BERRIES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">When	things	go	wrong	in	spite	of	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">To	smile's	the	best	thing	you	can	do—</p>
<p class="calibre1">To	smile	and	say,	"I'm	mighty	glad</p>
<p class="calibre1">They	are	no	worse;	they're	not	so	bad!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	is	what	Farmer	Brown's	boy	said	when	he	found	that	Buster	Bear	had	stolen the	berries	he	had	worked	so	hard	to	pick	and	then	had	run	off	with	the	pail.	You see,	 Farmer	 Brown's	 boy	 is	 learning	 to	 be	 something	 of	 a	 philosopher,	 one	 of those	people	who	accept	bad	things	cheerfully	and	right	away	see	how	they	are better	 than	 they	 might	 have	 been.	 When	 he	 had	 first	 heard	 some	 one	 in	 the bushes	where	he	had	hidden	his	pail	of	berries,	he	had	been	very	sure	that	it	was one	of	the	cows	or	young	cattle	who	live	in	the	Old	Pasture	during	the	summer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 had	 been	 afraid	 that	 they	 might	 stupidly	 kick	 over	 the	 pail	 and	 spill	 the berries,	 and	 he	 had	 hurried	 to	 drive	 whoever	 it	 was	 away.	 It	 hadn't	 entered	 his head	that	it	could	be	anybody	who	would	eat	those	berries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 he	 had	 yelled	 and	 Buster	 Bear	 had	 suddenly	 appeared,	 struggling	 to	 get off	the	pail	which	had	caught	over	his	head,	Farmer	Brown's	boy	had	been	too frightened	to	even	move.	Then	he	had	seen	Buster	tear	away	through	the	brush even	 more	 frightened	 than	 he	 was,	 and	 right	 away	 his	 courage	 had	 begun	 to come	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If	he	is	so	afraid	of	me,	I	guess	I	needn't	be	afraid	of	him,"	said	he.	"I've	lost	my berries,	but	it	is	worth	it	to	find	out	that	he	is	afraid	of	me.	There	are	plenty	more on	the	bushes,	and	all	I've	got	to	do	is	to	pick	them.	It	might	be	worse." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	walked	over	to	the	place	where	the	pail	had	been,	and	then	he	remembered that	when	Buster	ran	away	he	had	carried	the	pail	with	him,	hanging	about	his neck.	He	whistled.	It	was	a	comical	little	whistle	of	chagrin	as	he	realized	that	he had	 nothing	 in	 which	 to	 put	 more	 berries,	 even	 if	 he	 picked	 them.	 "It's	 worse than	 I	 thought,"	 cried	 he.	 "That	 bear	 has	 cheated	 me	 out	 of	 that	 berry	 pie	 my mother	 promised	 me."	 Then	 he	 began	 to	 laugh,	 as	 he	 thought	 of	 how	 funny</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>Buster	Bear	had	looked	with	the	pail	about	his	neck,	and	then	because,	you	know he	 is	 learning	 to	 be	 a	 philosopher,	 he	 once	 more	 repeated,	 "It	 might	 have	 been worse.	Yes,	indeed,	it	might	have	been	worse.	That	bear	might	have	tried	to	eat me	instead	of	the	berries.	I	guess	I'll	go	eat	that	lunch	I	left	back	by	the	spring, and	then	I'll	go	home.	I	can	pick	berries	some	other	day." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chuckling	happily	over	Buster	Bear's	great	fright,	Farmer	Brown's	boy	tramped back	to	the	spring	where	he	had	left	two	thick	sandwiches	on	a	flat	stone	when he	started	to	save	his	pail	of	berries.	"My,	but	those	sandwiches	will	taste	good," </p>
<p class="calibre1">thought	 he.	 "I'm	 glad	 they	 are	 big	 and	 thick.	 I	 never	 was	 hungrier	 in	 my	 life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hello!"	This	he	exclaimed	right	out	loud,	for	he	had	just	come	in	sight	of	the	flat stone	where	the	sandwiches	should	have	been,	and	they	were	not	there.	No,	Sir, there	wasn't	so	much	as	a	crumb	left	of	those	two	thick	sandwiches.	You	see,	Old Man	 Coyote	 had	 found	 them	 and	 gobbled	 them	 up	 while	 Farmer	 Brown's	 boy was	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 Farmer	 Brown's	 boy	 didn't	 know	 anything	 about	 Old	 Man	 Coyote.	 He rubbed	 his	 eyes	 and	 stared	 everywhere,	 even	 up	 in	 the	 trees,	 as	 if	 he	 thought those	 sandwiches	 might	 be	 hanging	 up	 there.	 They	 had	 disappeared	 as completely	 as	 if	 they	 never	 had	 been,	 and	 Old	 Man	 Coyote	 had	 taken	 care	 to leave	no	trace	of	his	visit.	Farmer	Brown's	boy	gaped	foolishly	this	way	and	that way.	Then,	instead	of	growing	angry,	a	slow	smile	stole	over	his	freckled	face.	"I guess	some	one	else	was	hungry	too,"	he	muttered.	"Wonder	who	it	was?	Guess this	Old	Pasture	is	no	place	for	me	to-day.	I'll	fill	up	on	berries	and	then	I'll	go home." </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	Farmer	Brown's	boy	made	his	lunch	on	blueberries	and	then	rather	sheepishly he	started	for	home	to	tell	of	all	the	strange	things	that	had	happened	to	him	in the	Old	Pasture.	Two	or	three	times,	as	he	trudged	along,	he	stopped	to	scratch his	 head	 thoughtfully.	 "I	 guess,"	 said	 he	 at	 last,	 "that	 I'm	 not	 so	 smart	 as	 I thought	I	was,	and	I've	got	a	lot	to	learn	yet." </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 is	 the	 end	 of	 the	 adventures	 of	 Buster	 Bear	 in	 this	 book	 because—guess why.	Because	Old	Mr.	Toad	insists	that	I	must	write	a	book	about	his	adventures, and	Old	Mr.	Toad	is	such	a	good	friend	of	all	of	us	that	I	am	going	to	do	it. </p>
