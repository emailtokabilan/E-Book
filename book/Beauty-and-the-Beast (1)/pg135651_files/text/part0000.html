<h1 class="tei14" id="pgepubid00001"><span class="calibre7">BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.</span></h1>

<p class="tei7">Once upon a time, in a very far-off country, there lived a merchant
who had been so fortunate in all his undertakings that he was
enormously rich. As he had, however, six sons and six daughters, he
found that his money was not too much to let them all have everything
they fancied, as they were accustomed to do.</p>

<p class="tei7">But one day a most unexpected misfortune befell them. Their house
caught fire and was speedily burnt to the ground, with all the splendid
furniture, the books, pictures, gold, silver, and precious goods it contained;
and this was only the beginning of their troubles. Their father,
who had until this moment prospered in all ways, suddenly lost every
ship he had upon the sea, either by dint of pirates, shipwreck, or fire.
Then he heard that his clerks in distant countries, whom he trusted entirely,
had proved unfaithful; and at last from great wealth he fell into
the direst poverty.</p>

<p class="tei7">All that he had left was a little house in a desolate place at least a
hundred leagues from the town in which he had lived, and to this he was
forced to retreat with his children, who were in despair at the idea of
leading such a different life. Indeed, the daughters at first hoped that
their friends, who had been so numerous while they were rich, would
insist on their staying in their houses now they no longer possessed one.
But they soon found that they were left alone, and that their former
friends even attributed their misfortunes to their own extravagance, and
showed no intention of offering them any help. So nothing was left for
them but to take their departure to the cottage, which stood in the midst of
a dark forest, and seemed to be the most dismal place upon the face of the
earth. As they were too poor to have any servants, the girls had to work
hard, like peasants, and the sons, for their part, cultivated the fields to
earn their living. Roughly clothed, and living in the simplest way, the<span class="tei13" id="page003">[pg 003]</span><a class="tei8"></a>
girls regretted unceasingly the luxuries and amusements of their former
life; only the youngest tried to be brave and cheerful. She had been as
sad as anyone when misfortune first overtook her father, but, soon recovering
her natural gaiety, she set to work to make the best of things, to
amuse her father and brothers as well as she could, and to try to persuade
her sisters to join her in dancing and singing. But they would do
nothing of the sort, and, because she was not as doleful as themselves,
they declared that this miserable life was all she was fit for. But she
was really far prettier and cleverer than they were; indeed, she was so
lovely that she was always called Beauty. After two years, when they
were all beginning to get used to their new life, something happened to
disturb their tranquillity. Their father received the news that one of his
ships, which he had believed to be lost, had come safely into port with a
rich cargo. All the sons and daughters at once thought that their poverty
was at an end, and wanted to set out directly for the town; but their
father, who was more prudent, begged them to wait a little, and, though
it was harvest-time, and he could ill be spared, determined to go himself
first, to make inquiries. Only the youngest daughter had any doubt but
that they would soon again be as rich as they were before, or at least rich
enough to live comfortably in some town where they would find amusement
and gay companions once more. So they all loaded their father
with commissions for jewels and dresses which it would have taken a fortune
to buy; only Beauty, feeling sure that it was of no use, did not ask
for anything. Her father, noticing her silence, said: "And what shall I
bring for you, Beauty?"</p>

<p class="tei7">"The only thing I wish for is to see you come home safely," she answered.</p>

<p class="tei7">But this reply vexed her sisters, who fancied she was blaming them
for having asked for such costly things. Her father, however, was
pleased, but as he thought that at her age she certainly ought to like
pretty presents, he told her to choose something.</p>

<p class="tei7">"Well, dear father," she said, "as you insist upon it, I beg that you
will bring me a rose. I have not seen one since we came here, and I
love them so much."</p>

<p class="tei7">So the merchant set out and reached the town as quickly as possible,
but only to find that his former companions, believing him to be dead,<span class="tei13" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a class="tei8"></a>
had divided between them the goods which the ship had brought; and
after six months of trouble and expense he found himself as poor as
when he started, having been able to recover only just enough to pay
the cost of his journey. To make matters worse, he was obliged to leave
the town in the most terrible weather, so that by the time he was within
a few leagues of his home he was almost exhausted with cold and fatigue.
Though he knew it would take some hours to get through the forest, he
was so anxious to be at his journey's end that he resolved to go on; but
night overtook him, and the deep snow and bitter frost made it impossible
for his horse to carry him any further. Not a house was to be seen;
the only shelter he could get was the hollow trunk of a great tree, and there
he crouched all the night, which seemed to him the longest he had ever
known. In spite of his weariness the howling of the wolves kept him
awake, and even when at last the day broke he was not much better off,
for the falling snow had covered up every path, and he did not know
which way to turn.</p>

<a></a><div class="tei11">Illustration</div>

<p class="tei7">At length he made out some sort of track, and though at the beginning<span class="tei13" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a class="tei8"></a>
it was so rough and slippery that he fell down more than once, it presently
became easier, and led him into an avenue of trees which ended in a
splendid castle. It seemed to the merchant very strange that no snow
had fallen in the avenue, which was entirely composed of orange trees,
covered with flowers and fruit. When he reached the first court of the
castle he saw before him a flight of agate steps, and went up them, and
passed through several splendidly furnished rooms. The pleasant warmth
of the air revived him, and he felt very hungry; but there seemed to
be nobody in all this vast and splendid palace whom he could ask to give
him something to eat. Deep silence reigned everywhere, and at last,
tired of roaming through empty rooms and galleries, he stopped in a room
smaller than the rest, where a clear fire was burning and a couch was
drawn up cosily close to it. Thinking that this must be prepared for
someone who was expected, he sat down to wait till he should come, and
very soon fell into a sweet sleep.</p>

<p class="tei7">When his extreme hunger wakened him after several hours, he was
still alone; but a little table, upon which was a good dinner, had been drawn
up close to him, and, as he had eaten nothing for twenty-four hours, he
lost no time in beginning his meal, hoping that he might soon have an
opportunity of thanking his considerate entertainer, whoever it might be.</p>

<p class="tei7">But no one appeared, and even after another long sleep, from which he
awoke completely refreshed, there was no sign of anybody, though a
fresh meal of dainty cakes and fruit was prepared upon the little table at
his elbow. Being naturally timid, the silence began to terrify him, and
he resolved to search once more through all the rooms; but it was of no
use. Not even a servant was to be seen; there was no sign of life in the
palace! He began to wonder what he should do, and to amuse himself
by pretending that all the treasures he saw were his own, and considering
how he would divide them among his children. Then he went down into
the garden, and though it was winter everywhere else, here the sun
shone, and the birds sang, and the flowers bloomed, and the air was soft
and sweet. The merchant, in ecstacies with all he saw and heard, said
to himself:</p>

<p class="tei7">"All this must be meant for me. I will go this minute and bring my
children to share all these delights."</p>

<p class="tei7">In spite of being so cold and weary when he reached the castle, he had<span class="tei13" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a class="tei8"></a>
taken his horse to the stable and fed it. Now he thought he would saddle
it for his homeward journey, and he turned down the path which led
to the stable. This path had a hedge of roses on each side of it, and the
merchant thought he had never seen or smelt such exquisite flowers.
They reminded him of his promise to Beauty, and he stopped and had
just gathered one to take to her when he was startled by a strange noise
behind him. Turning round, he saw a frightful Beast, which seemed to be
very angry and said, in a terrible voice:</p>

<a></a><div class="tei11">Illustration</div>

<p class="tei7">"Who told you that you might gather my roses? Was it not enough
that I allowed you to be in my palace and was kind to you? This is the
way you show your gratitude, by stealing my flowers! But your insolence
shall not go unpunished." The merchant, terrified by these furious words,
dropped the fatal rose, and, throwing himself on his knees, cried: "Pardon
me, noble sir. I am truly grateful to you for your hospitality, which was
so magnificent that I could not imagine that you would be offended by<span class="tei13" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a class="tei8"></a>
my taking such a little thing as a rose." But the Beast's anger was not
lessened by this speech.</p>

<p class="tei7">"You are very ready with excuses and flattery," he cried; "but that
will not save you from the death you deserve."</p>

<p class="tei7">"Alas!" thought the merchant, "if my daughter Beauty could only
know what danger her rose has brought me into!"</p>

<p class="tei7">And in despair he began to tell the Beast all his misfortunes, and the
reason of his journey, not forgetting to mention Beauty's request.</p>

<p class="tei7">"A king's ransom would hardly have procured all that my other daughters
asked," he said; "but I thought that I might at least take Beauty her
rose. I beg you to forgive me, for you see I meant no harm."</p>

<p class="tei7">The Beast considered for a moment, and then he said, in a less furious
tone:</p>

<p class="tei7">"I will forgive you on one condition--that is, that you will give me
one of your daughters."</p>

<p class="tei7">"Ah!" cried the merchant, "if I were cruel enough to buy my own life
at the expense of one of my children's, what excuse could I invent to
bring her here?"</p>

<p class="tei7">"No excuse would be necessary," answered the Beast. "If she comes
at all she must come willingly. On no other condition will I have her. See
if any one of them is courageous enough, and loves you well enough to
come and save your life. You seem to be an honest man, so I will trust
you to go home. I give you a month to see if either of your daughters
will come back with you and stay here, to let you go free. If neither of
them is willing, you must come alone, after bidding them good-bye for
ever, for then you will belong to me. And do not imagine that you can hide
from me, for if you fail to keep your word I will come and fetch you!"
added the Beast grimly.</p>

<p class="tei7">The merchant accepted this proposal, though he did not really think
any of his daughters would be persuaded to come. He promised to return
at the time appointed, and then, anxious to escape from the presence of
the Beast, he asked permission to set off at once. But the Beast answered
that he could not go until the next day.</p>

<p class="tei7">"Then you will find a horse ready for you," he said. "Now go and
eat your supper, and await my orders."</p>

<p class="tei7">The poor merchant, more dead than alive, went back to his room, where<span class="tei13" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a class="tei8"></a>
the most delicious supper was already served on the little table which was
drawn up before a blazing fire. But he was too terrified to eat, and only
tasted a few of the dishes, for fear the Beast should be angry if he did not
obey his orders. When he had finished he heard a great noise in the
next room, which he knew meant that the Beast was coming. As he
could do nothing to escape his visit, the only thing that remained was to
seem as little afraid as possible; so when the Beast appeared and asked
roughly if he had supped well, the merchant answered humbly that he had,
thanks to his host's kindness. Then the Beast warned him to remember
their agreement, and to prepare his daughter exactly for what she had to
expect.</p>

<p class="tei7">"Do not get up to-morrow," he added, "until you see the sun and hear
a golden bell ring. Then you will find your breakfast waiting for you
here, and the horse you are to ride will be ready in the courtyard. He
will also bring you back again when you come with your daughter a
month hence. Farewell. Take a rose to Beauty, and remember your
promise!"</p>

<p class="tei7">The merchant was only too glad when the Beast went away, and though
he could not sleep for sadness, he lay down until the sun rose. Then,
after a hasty breakfast, he went to gather Beauty's rose, and mounted his
horse, which carried him off so swiftly that in an instant he had lost sight
of the palace, and he was still wrapped in gloomy thoughts when it stopped
before the door of the cottage.</p>

<p class="tei7">His sons and daughters, who had been very uneasy at his long absence,
rushed to meet him, eager to know the result of his journey, which, seeing
him mounted upon a splendid horse and wrapped in a rich mantle, they
supposed to be favorable. But he hid the truth from them at first, only
saying sadly to Beauty as he gave her the rose:</p>

<p class="tei7">"Here is what you asked me to bring you; you little know what it has
cost."</p>

<p class="tei7">But this excited their curiosity so greatly that presently he told them
his adventures from beginning to end, and then they were all very unhappy.
The girls lamented loudly over their lost hopes, and the sons declared that
their father should not return to this terrible castle, and began to make
plans for killing the Beast if it should come to fetch him. But he reminded
them that he had promised to go back. Then the girls were very angry<span class="tei13" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a class="tei8"></a>
with Beauty, and said it was all her fault, and that if she had asked for
something sensible this would never have happened, and complained
bitterly that they should have to suffer for her folly.</p>

<p class="tei7">Poor Beauty, much distressed, said to them:</p>

<p class="tei7">"I have indeed caused this misfortune, but I assure you I did it innocently.
Who could have guessed that to ask for a rose in the middle of
summer would cause so much misery? But as I did the mischief it is
only just that I should suffer for it. I will therefore go back with my
father to keep his promise."</p>

<p class="tei7">At first nobody would hear of this arrangement, and her father and
brothers, who loved her dearly, declared that nothing should make them
let her go; but Beauty was firm. As the time drew near she divided all
her little possessions between her sisters, and said good-bye to everything
she loved, and when the fatal day came she encouraged and cheered her
father as they mounted together the horse which had brought him back.
It seemed to fly rather than gallop, but so smoothly that Beauty was not
frightened; indeed, she would have enjoyed the journey if she had not
feared what might happen to her at the end of it. Her father still tried to
persuade her to go back, but in vain. While they were talking the night
fell, and then, to their great surprise, wonderful colored lights began to
shine in all directions, and splendid fireworks blazed out before them; all
the forest was illuminated by them, and even felt pleasantly warm,
though it had been bitterly cold before. This lasted until they reached
the avenue of orange trees, where were statues holding flaming torches,
and when they got nearer to the palace they saw that it was illuminated
from the roof to the ground, and music sounded softly from the courtyard.</p>

<p class="tei7">"The Beast must be very hungry," said Beauty, trying to laugh, "if he
makes all this rejoicing over the arrival of his prey."</p>

<p class="tei7">But, in spite of her anxiety, she could not help admiring all the wonderful
things she saw.</p>

<p class="tei7">The horse stopped at the foot of the flight of steps leading to the terrace,
and when they had dismounted her father led her to the little room
he had been in before, where they found a splendid fire burning, and the
table daintily spread with a delicious supper.</p>

<p class="tei7">The merchant knew that this was meant for them, and Beauty, who was
rather less frightened now that she had passed through so many rooms<span class="tei13" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a class="tei8"></a>
and seen nothing of the Beast, was quite willing to begin, for her long ride
had made her very hungry. But they had hardly finished their meal
when the noise of the Beast's footsteps was heard approaching, and
Beauty clung to her father in terror, which became all the greater when she
saw how frightened he was. But when the Beast really appeared, though
she trembled at the sight of him, she made a great effort to hide her horror,
and saluted him respectfully.</p>

<p class="tei7">This evidently pleased the Beast. After looking at her he said, in a
tone that might have struck terror into the boldest heart, though he did
not seem to be angry:</p>

<p class="tei7">"Good-evening, old man. Good-evening, Beauty."</p>

<p class="tei7">The merchant was too terrified to reply, but Beauty answered sweetly:</p>

<p class="tei7">"Good-evening, Beast."</p>

<p class="tei7">"Have you come willingly?" asked the Beast. "Will you be content
to stay here when your father goes away?"</p>

<p class="tei7">Beauty answered bravely that she was quite prepared to stay.</p>

<p class="tei7">"I am pleased with you," said the Beast. "As you have come of
your own accord, you may stay. As for you, old man," he added, turning
to the merchant, "at sunrise to-morrow you will take your departure.
When the bell rings get up quickly and eat your breakfast, and you will
find the same horse waiting to take you home; but remember that you
must never expect to see my palace again."</p>

<p class="tei7">Then turning to Beauty, he said:</p>

<p class="tei7">"Take your father into the next room, and help him to choose everything
you think your brothers and sisters would like to have. You will
find two traveling-trunks there; fill them as full as you can. It is only
just that you should send them something very precious as a remembrance
of yourself."</p>

<p class="tei7">Then he went away, after saying, "Good-bye, Beauty; good-bye, old
man;" and though Beauty was beginning to think with great dismay of
her father's departure, she was afraid to disobey the Beast's orders; and
they went into the next room, which had shelves and cupboards all round
it. They were greatly surprised at the riches it contained. There were
splendid dresses fit for a queen, with all the ornaments that were to be
worn with them; and when Beauty opened the cupboards she was quite
dazzled by the gorgeous jewels that lay in heaps upon every shelf.<span class="tei13" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a class="tei8"></a>
After choosing a vast quantity, which she divided between her sisters--for
she had made a heap of the wonderful dresses for each of them---she
opened the last chest, which was full of gold.</p>

<p class="tei7">"I think, father," she said, "that, as the gold will be more useful to you,
we had better take out the other things again, and fill the trunks with it."
So they did this; but the more they put in, the more room there seemed
to be, and at last they put back all the jewels and dresses they had taken
out, and Beauty even added as many more of the jewels as she could
carry at once; and then the trunks were not too full, but they were so
heavy that an elephant could not have carried them!</p>

<p class="tei7">"The Beast was mocking us," cried the merchant; "he must have
pretended to give us all these things, knowing that I could not carry them
away."</p>

<p class="tei7">"Let us wait and see," answered Beauty. "I cannot believe that he
meant to deceive us. All we can do is to fasten them up and leave them
ready."</p>

<p class="tei7">So they did this and returned to the little room, where, to their
astonishment, they found breakfast ready. The merchant ate his with a
good appetite, as the Beast's generosity made him believe that he might
perhaps venture to come back soon and see Beauty. But she felt sure
that her father was leaving her for ever, so she was very sad when the
bell rang sharply for the second time, and warned them that the time was
come for them to part. They went down into the courtyard, where two
horses were waiting, one loaded with the two trunks, the other for him to
ride. They were pawing the ground in their impatience to start, and the
merchant was forced to bid Beauty a hasty farewell; and as soon as he
was mounted he went off at such a pace that she lost sight of him in an instant.
Then Beauty began to cry, and wandered sadly back to her own
room. But she soon found that she was very sleepy, and as she had nothing
better to do she lay down and instantly fell asleep. And then she
dreamed that she was walking by a brook bordered with trees, and lamenting
her sad fate, when a young prince, handsomer than anyone she had
ever seen, and with a voice that went straight to her heart, came and said
to her, "Ah, Beauty! you are not so unfortunate as you suppose. Here
you will be rewarded for all you have suffered elsewhere. Your every
wish shall be gratified. Only try to find me out, no matter how I may be<span class="tei13" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a class="tei8"></a>
disguised, as I love you dearly, and in making me happy you will find
your own happiness. Be as true-hearted as you are beautiful, and we shall
have nothing left to wish for."</p>

<p class="tei7">"What can I do, Prince, to make you happy?" said Beauty.</p>

<p class="tei7">"Only be grateful," he answered, "and do not trust too much to your
eyes. And, above all, do not desert me until you have saved me from
my cruel misery."</p>

<p class="tei7">After this she thought she found herself in a room with a stately and
beautiful lady, who said to her:</p>

<p class="tei7">"Dear Beauty, try not to regret all you have left behind you, for you
are destined to a better fate. Only do not let yourself be deceived by
appearances."</p>

<a></a><div class="tei11">Illustration</div>

<p class="tei7">Beauty found her dreams so interesting that she was in no hurry to
awake, but presently the clock roused her by calling her name softly
twelve times, and then she got up and found her dressing-table set out
with everything she could possibly want; and when her toilet was finished
she found dinner was waiting in the room next to hers. But dinner
does not take very long when you are all by yourself, and very soon she
sat down cosily in the corner of a sofa, and began to think about the
charming Prince she had seen in her dream.</p>

<p class="tei7">"He said I could make him happy," said Beauty to herself.</p>

<span class="tei13" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a class="tei8"></a>

<p class="tei7">"It seems, then, that this horrible Beast keeps him a prisoner. How
can I set him free? I wonder why they both told me not to trust to appearances?
I don't understand it. But, after all, it was only a dream, so
why should I trouble myself about it? I had better go and find something
to do to amuse myself."</p>

<p class="tei7">So she got up and began to explore some of the many rooms of the
palace.</p>

<p class="tei7">The first she entered was lined with mirrors, and Beauty saw herself
reflected on every side, and thought she had never seen such a charming
room. Then a bracelet which was hanging from a chandelier caught her
eye, and on taking it down she was greatly surprised to find that it held
a portrait of her unknown admirer, just as she had seen him in her
dream. With great delight she slipped the bracelet on her arm, and
went on into a gallery of pictures, where she soon found a portrait of the
same handsome Prince, as large as life, and so well painted that as she
studied it he seemed to smile kindly at her. Tearing herself away from
the portrait at last, she passed through into a room which contained every
musical instrument under the sun, and here she amused herself for a long
while in trying some of them, and singing until she was tired. The
next room was a library, and she saw everything she had ever wanted to
read, as well as everything she had read, and it seemed to her that a
whole lifetime would not be enough even to read the names of the books,
there were so many. By this time it was growing dusk, and wax candles
in diamond and ruby candlesticks were beginning to light themselves
in every room.</p>

<p class="tei7">Beauty found her supper served just at the time she preferred to have
it, but she did not see anyone or hear a sound, and, though her father
had warned her that she would be alone, she began to find it rather dull.</p>

<p class="tei7">But presently she heard the Beast coming, and wondered tremblingly
if he meant to eat her up now.</p>

<p class="tei7">However, as he did not seem at all ferocious, and only said gruffly:</p>

<p class="tei7">"Good-evening, Beauty," she answered cheerfully and managed to
conceal her terror. Then the Beast asked her how she had been amusing
herself, and she told him all the rooms she had seen.</p>

<p class="tei7">Then he asked if she thought she could be happy in his palace; and
Beauty answered that everything was so beautiful that she would be very<span class="tei13" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a class="tei8"></a>
hard to please if she could not be happy. And after about an hour's talk
Beauty began to think that the Beast was not nearly so terrible as she
had supposed at first. Then he got up to leave her, and said in his
gruff voice:</p>

<p class="tei7">"Do you love me, Beauty? Will you marry me?"</p>

<p class="tei7">"Oh! what shall I say?" cried Beauty, for she was afraid to make the
Beast angry by refusing.</p>

<p class="tei7">"Say 'yes' or 'no' without fear," he replied.</p>

<p class="tei7">"Oh! no, Beast," said Beauty hastily.</p>

<p class="tei7">"Since you will not, good-night, Beauty," he said. And she answered:</p>

<p class="tei7">"Good-night, Beast," very glad to find that her refusal had not provoked
him. And after he was gone she was very soon in bed and
asleep, and dreaming of her unknown Prince. She thought he came
and said to her:</p>

<p class="tei7">"Ah, Beauty! why are you so unkind to me? I fear I am fated to be
unhappy for many a long day still."</p>

<p class="tei7">And then her dreams changed, but the charming Prince figured in them
all; and when morning came her first thought was to look at the portrait
and see if it was really like him, and she found that it certainly was.</p>

<p class="tei7">This morning she decided to amuse herself in the garden, for the sun
shone, and all the fountains were playing; but she was astonished to find
that every place was familiar to her, and presently she came to the brook
where the myrtle trees were growing where she had first met the Prince
in her dream, and that made her think more than ever that he must be
kept a prisoner by the Beast. When she was tired she went back to the
palace, and found a new room full of materials for every kind of work--ribbons
to make into bows, and silks to work into flowers. Then there
was an aviary full of rare birds, which were so tame that they flew to
Beauty as soon as they saw her, and perched upon her shoulders and her
head.</p>

<p class="tei7">"Pretty little creatures," she said, "how I wish that your cage was
nearer to my room, that I might often hear you sing!"</p>

<p class="tei7">So saying she opened a door, and found to her delight that it led into
her own room, though she had thought it was quite the other side of the
palace.</p>

<span class="tei13" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a class="tei8"></a>

<a></a><div class="tei11">Illustration</div>

<p class="tei7">There were more birds in a room farther on, parrots and cockatoos
that could talk, and they greeted Beauty by name; indeed, she found
them so entertaining that she took one or two back to her room, and
they talked to her while she was at supper; after which the Beast paid
her his usual visit, and asked the same questions as before, and then with
a gruff "good-night" he took
his departure, and Beauty
went to bed to dream of her
mysterious Prince. The
days passed swiftly in different
amusements, and after
a while Beauty found out another
strange thing in the
palace, which often pleased
her when she was tired of
being alone. There was one
room which she had not
noticed particularly; it was
empty, except that under
each of the windows stood
a very comfortable chair;
and the first time she had
looked out of the window it
had seemed to her that a
black curtain prevented her
from seeing anything outside.
But the second time
she went into the room, happening
to be tired, she sat
down in one of the chairs,
when instantly the curtain was rolled aside, and a most amusing pantomime
was acted before her; there were dances and colored lights, and
music, and pretty dresses, and it was all so gay that Beauty was in ecstacies.
After that she tried the other seven windows in turn, and there
was some new and surprising entertainment to be seen from each of them,
so that Beauty never could feel lonely any more. Every evening after<span class="tei13" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a class="tei8"></a>
supper the Beast came to see her, and always before saying good-night
asked her in his terrible voice:</p>

<p class="tei7">"Beauty, will you marry me?"</p>

<p class="tei7">And it seemed to Beauty, now she understood him better, that when
she said, "No, Beast," he went away quite sad. But her happy dreams
of the handsome young Prince soon made her forget the poor Beast, and
the only thing that at all disturbed her was to be constantly told to
distrust appearances, to let her heart guide her, and not her eyes, and
many other equally perplexing things, which, consider as she would, she
could not understand.</p>

<p class="tei7">So everything went on for a long time, until at last, happy as she was,
Beauty began to long for the sight of her father and her brothers and
sisters; and one night, seeing her look very sad, the Beast asked her
what was the matter. Beauty had quite ceased to be afraid of him. Now
she knew that he was really gentle in spite of his ferocious looks and his
dreadful voice. So she answered that she was longing to see her home
once more. Upon hearing this the Beast seemed sadly distressed, and
cried miserably.</p>

<p class="tei7">"Ah! Beauty, have you the heart to desert an unhappy Beast like this?
What more do you want to make you happy? Is it because you hate me
that you want to escape?"</p>

<p class="tei7">"No, dear Beast," answered Beauty softly, "I do not hate you, and I
should be very sorry never to see you any more, but I long to see my father
again. Only let me go for two months, and I promise to come back to
you and stay for the rest of my life."</p>

<p class="tei7">The Beast, who had been sighing dolefully while she spoke, now
replied:</p>

<p class="tei7">"I cannot refuse you anything you ask, even though it should cost me
my life. Take the four boxes you will find in the room next to your own,
and fill them with everything you wish to take with you. But remember
your promise and come back when the two months are over, or you may
have cause to repent it, for if you do not come in good time you will find your
faithful Beast dead. You will not need any chariot to bring you back.
Only say good-bye to all your brothers and sisters the night before you
come away, and when you have gone to bed turn this ring round upon
your finger and say firmly: 'I wish to go back to my palace and see my<span class="tei13" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a class="tei8"></a>
Beast again.' Good-night, Beauty.  Fear nothing, sleep peacefully, and
before long you shall see your father once more."</p>

<p class="tei7">As soon as Beauty was alone she hastened to fill the boxes with all the
rare and precious things she saw about her, and only when she was tired
of heaping things into them did they seem to be full.</p>

<p class="tei7">Then she went to bed, but could hardly sleep for joy. And when at
last she did begin to dream of her beloved Prince she was grieved to see
him stretched upon a grassy bank sad and weary, and hardly like himself.</p>

<p class="tei7">"What is the matter?" she cried.</p>

<p class="tei7">But he looked at her reproachfully, and said:</p>

<p class="tei7">"How can you ask me, cruel one? Are you not leaving me to my
death perhaps?"</p>

<p class="tei7">"Ah! don't be so sorrowful," cried Beauty; "I am only going to assure
my father that I am safe and happy. I have promised the Beast faithfully
that I will come back, and he would die of grief if I did not keep my
word!"</p>

<p class="tei7">"What would that matter to you?" said the Prince. "Surely you
would not care?"</p>

<p class="tei7">"Indeed I should be ungrateful if I did not care for such a kind Beast,"
cried Beauty indignantly. "I would die to save him from pain. I assure
you it is not his fault that he is so ugly."</p>

<p class="tei7">Just then a strange sound woke her--someone was speaking not very
far away; and opening her eyes she found herself in a room she had
never seen before, which was certainly not nearly so splendid as those
she was used to in the Beast's palace. Where could she be? She got
up and dressed hastily, and then saw that the boxes she had packed the
night before were all in the room. While she was wondering by what
magic the Beast had transported them and herself to this strange place
she suddenly heard her father's voice, and rushed out and greeted him
joyfully. Her brothers and sisters were all astonished at her appearance,
as they had never expected to see her again, and there was no end to the
questions they asked her. She had also much to hear about what had
happened to them while she was away, and of her father's journey home.
But when they heard that she had only come to be with them for a short
time, and then must go back to the Beast's palace for ever, they lamented<span class="tei13" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a class="tei8"></a>
loudly. Then Beauty asked her father what he thought could be
the meaning of her strange dreams, and why the Prince constantly begged
her not to trust to appearances. After much consideration he answered:
"You tell me yourself that the Beast, frightful as he is, loves you dearly,
and deserves your love and gratitude for his gentleness and kindness; I
think the Prince must mean you to understand that you ought to reward
him by doing as he wishes you to, in spite of his ugliness."</p>

<p class="tei7">Beauty could not help seeing that this seemed very probable; still,
when she thought of her dear Prince who was so handsome, she did not
feel at all inclined to marry the Beast. At any rate, for two months she
need not decide, but could enjoy herself with her sisters. But though
they were rich now, and lived in a town again, and had plenty of acquaintances,
Beauty found that nothing amused her very much; and she often
thought of the palace, where she was so happy, especially as at home she
never once dreamed of her dear Prince, and she felt quite sad without
him.</p>

<p class="tei7">Then her sisters seemed to have got quite used to being without her, and
even found her rather in the way, so she would not have been sorry
when the two months were over but for her father and brothers, who
begged her to stay, and seemed so grieved at the thought of her departure
that she had not the courage to say good-bye to them. Every
day when she got up she meant to say it at night, and when night came
she put it off again, until at last she had a dismal dream which helped
her to make up her mind. She thought she was wandering in a lonely
path in the palace gardens, when she heard groans which seemed to come
from some bushes hiding the entrance of a cave, and running quickly to
see what could be the matter, she found the Beast stretched out upon his
side, apparently dying. He reproached her faintly with being the cause
of his distress, and at the same moment a stately lady appeared, and said
very gravely:</p>

<p class="tei7">"Ah! Beauty, you are only just in time to save his life. See what
happens when people do not keep their promises! If you had delayed
one day more, you would have found him dead."</p>

<p class="tei7">Beauty was so terrified by this dream that the next morning she announced
her intention of going back at once, and that very night she
said good-bye to her father and all her brothers and sisters, and as soon<span class="tei13" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a class="tei8"></a>
as she was in bed she turned her ring round upon her finger, and said
firmly:</p>

<p class="tei7">"I wish to go back to my palace and see my Beast again," as she had
been told to do.</p>

<p class="tei7">Then she fell asleep instantly, and only woke up to hear the clock
saying, "Beauty, Beauty," twelve times in its musical voice, which told
her at once that she was really in the palace once more. Everything
was just as before, and her birds were so glad to see her! but Beauty
thought she had never known such a long day, for she was so anxious to
see the Beast again that she felt as if supper-time would never come.</p>

<a></a><div class="tei11">Illustration</div>

<p class="tei7">But when it did come and no Beast appeared she was really frightened;
so, after listening and waiting for a long time, she ran down into the
garden to search for him. Up and down the paths and avenues ran
poor Beauty, calling him in vain, for no one answered, and not a
trace of him could she find; until at last, quite tired, she stopped for a
minute's rest, and saw that she was standing opposite the shady path she
had seen in her dream. She rushed down it, and, sure enough, there
was the cave, and in it lay the Beast--asleep, as Beauty thought. Quite
glad to have found him, she ran up and stroked his head, but to her
horror he did not move or open his eyes.</p>

<p class="tei7">"Oh! he is dead; and it is all my fault," said Beauty, crying bitterly.</p>

<p class="tei7">But then, looking at him again, she fancied he still breathed, and, hastily<span class="tei13" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a class="tei8"></a>
fetching some water from the nearest fountain, she sprinkled it over his
face, and to her great delight he began to revive.</p>

<p class="tei7">"Oh! Beast, how you frightened me!" she cried. "I never knew how
much I loved you until just now, when I feared I was too late to save
your life."</p>

<p class="tei7">"Can you really love such an ugly creature as I am?" said the Beast
faintly. "Ah! Beauty, you only came just in time. I was dying because
I thought you had forgotten your promise. But go back now and rest,
I shall see you again by-and-by."</p>

<p class="tei7">Beauty, who had half expected that he would be angry with her, was
reassured by his gentle voice, and went back to the palace, where supper
was awaiting her; and afterwards the Beast came in as usual, and talked
about the time she had spent with her father, asking if she had enjoyed
herself, and if they had all been very glad to see her.</p>

<p class="tei7">Beauty answered politely, and quite enjoyed telling him all that had
happened to her. And when at last the time came for him to go, and he
asked, as he had so often asked before:</p>

<p class="tei7">"Beauty, will you marry me?" she answered softly:</p>

<p class="tei7">"Yes, dear Beast."</p>

<p class="tei7">As she spoke a blaze of light sprang up before the windows of the
palace; fireworks crackled and guns banged, and across the avenue of
orange trees, in letters all made of fire-flies, was written: "Long live the
Prince and his Bride."</p>

<p class="tei7">Turning to ask the Beast what it could all mean, Beauty found that
he had disappeared, and in his place stood her long-loved Prince! At
the same moment the wheels of a chariot were heard upon the terrace,
and two ladies entered the room. One of them Beauty recognized as the
stately lady she had seen in her dreams; the other was also so grand and
queenly that Beauty hardly knew which to greet first.</p>

<p class="tei7">But the one she already knew said to her companion:</p>

<p class="tei7">"Well, Queen, this is Beauty, who has had the courage to rescue your
son from the terrible enchantment. They love one another, and only
your consent to their marriage is wanting to make them perfectly happy."</p>

<p class="tei7">"I consent with all my heart," cried the Queen. "How can I ever thank
you enough, charming girl, for having restored my dear son to his natural
form?"</p>

<p class="tei7">And then she tenderly embraced Beauty and the Prince, who had meanwhile
been greeting the Fairy and receiving her congratulations.</p>

<p class="tei7">"Now," said the Fairy to Beauty, "I suppose you would like me to
send for all your brothers and sisters to dance at your wedding?"</p>

<p class="tei7">And so she did, and the marriage was celebrated the very next day with
the utmost splendor, and Beauty and the Prince lived happily ever after.</p>
