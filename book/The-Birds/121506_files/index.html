<p class="calibre1"><a id="p5"></a><b class="calibre3">INTRODUCTION</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">'The	 Birds'	 differs	 markedly	 from	 all	 the	 other	 Comedies	 of	 Aristophanes which	 have	 come	 down	 to	 us	 in	 subject	 and	 general	 conception.	 It	 is	 just	 an extravaganza	 pure	 and	 simple—a	 graceful,	 whimsical	 theme	 chosen	 expressly for	the	sake	of	the	opportunities	it	afforded	of	bright,	amusing	dialogue,	pleasing lyrical	 interludes,	 and	 charming	 displays	 of	 brilliant	 stage	 effects	 and	 pretty dresses.	 Unlike	 other	 plays	 of	 the	 same	 Author,	 there	 is	 here	 apparently	 no serious	political	MOTIF	underlying	the	surface	burlesque	and	buffoonery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	 critics,	 it	 is	 true,	 profess	 to	 find	 in	 it	 a	 reference	 to	 the	 unfortunate Sicilian	 Expedition,	 then	 in	 progress,	 and	 a	 prophecy	 of	 its	 failure	 and	 the political	downfall	of	Alcibiades.	But	as	a	matter	of	fact,	the	whole	thing	seems rather	an	attempt	on	the	dramatist's	part	to	relieve	the	overwrought	minds	of	his fellow-citizens,	 anxious	 and	 discouraged	 at	 the	 unsatisfactory	 reports	 from before	 Syracuse,	 by	 a	 work	 conceived	 in	 a	 lighter	 vein	 than	 usual	 and	 mainly unconnected	with	contemporary	realities.	The	play	was	produced	in	the	year	414</p>
<p class="calibre1">B.C.,	just	when	success	or	failure	in	Sicily	hung	in	the	balance,	though	already the	outlook	was	gloomy,	and	many	circumstances	pointed	to	impending	disaster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover,	 the	 public	 conscience	 was	 still	 shocked	 and	 perturbed	 over	 the mysterious	 affair	 of	 the	 mutilation	 of	 the	 Hermae,	 which	 had	 occurred immediately	before	the	sailing	of	the	fleet,	and	strongly	suspicious	of	Alcibiades' </p>
<p class="calibre1">participation	 in	 the	 outrage.	 In	 spite	 of	 the	 inherent	 charm	 of	 the	 subject,	 the splendid	outbursts	of	lyrical	poetry	in	some	of	the	choruses	and	the	beauty	of	the scenery	 and	 costumes,	 'The	 Birds'	 failed	 to	 win	 the	 first	 prize.	 This	 was acclaimed	 to	 a	 play	 of	 Aristophanes'	 rival,	 Amipsias,	 the	 title	 of	 which,	 'The Comastoe,'	 or	 'Revellers,'	 "seems	 to	 imply	 that	 the	 chief	 interest	 was	 derived from	 direct	 allusions	 to	 the	 outrage	 above	 mentioned	 and	 to	 the	 individuals suspected	to	have	been	engaged	in	it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 this	 reason,	 which	 militated	 against	 its	 immediate	 success,	 viz.	 the absence	 of	 direct	 allusion	 to	 contemporary	 politics—there	 are,	 of	 course, incidental	 references	 here	 and	 there	 to	 topics	 and	 personages	 of	 the	 day—the play	 appeals	 perhaps	 more	 than	 any	 other	 of	 our	 Author's	 productions	 to	 the modern	reader.	Sparkling	wit,	whimsical	fancy,	poetic	charm,	are	of	all	ages,	and can	 be	 appreciated	 as	 readily	 by	 ourselves	 as	 by	 an	 Athenian	 audience	 of	 two thousand	 years	 ago,	 though,	 of	 course,	 much	 is	 inevitably	 lost	 "without	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p6"></a>important	 adjuncts	 of	 music,	 scenery,	 dresses	 and	 what	 we	 may	 call	 'spectacle' </p>
<p class="calibre1">generally,	which	we	know	in	this	instance	to	have	been	on	the	most	magnificent</p>
<p class="calibre1">scale." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	plot	is	this.	Euelpides	and	Pisthetaerus,	two	old	Athenians,	disgusted	with the	 litigiousness,	 wrangling	 and	 sycophancy	 of	 their	 countrymen,	 resolve	 upon quitting	 Attica.	 Having	 heard	 of	 the	 fame	 of	 Epops	 (the	 hoopoe),	 sometime called	Tereus,	and	now	King	of	the	Birds,	they	determine,	under	the	direction	of a	raven	and	a	jackdaw,	to	seek	from	him	and	his	subject	birds	a	city	free	from	all care	 and	 strife.	 Arrived	 at	 the	 Palace	 of	 Epops,	 they	 knock,	 and	 Trochilus	 (the wren),	in	a	state	of	great	flutter,	as	he	mistakes	them	for	fowlers,	opens	the	door and	 informs	 them	 that	 his	 Majesty	 is	 asleep.	 When	 he	 awakes,	 the	 strangers appear	 before	 him,	 and	 after	 listening	 to	 a	 long	 and	 eloquent	 harangue	 on	 the superior	 attractions	 of	 a	 residence	 among	 the	 birds,	 they	 propose	 a	 notable scheme	of	their	own	to	further	enhance	its	advantages	and	definitely	secure	the sovereignty	of	the	universe	now	exercised	by	the	gods	of	Olympus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 birds	 are	 summoned	 to	 meet	 in	 general	 council.	 They	 come	 flying	 up from	 all	 quarters	 of	 the	 heavens,	 and	 after	 a	 brief	 mis-understanding,	 during which	they	come	near	tearing	the	two	human	envoys	to	pieces,	they	listen	to	the exposition	of	the	latters'	plan.	This	is	nothing	less	than	the	building	of	a	new	city, to	 be	 called	 Nephelococcygia,	 or	 'Cloud-cuckoo-town,'	 between	 earth	 and heaven,	to	be	garrisoned	and	guarded	by	the	birds	in	such	a	way	as	to	intercept all	 communication	 of	 the	 gods	 with	 their	 worshippers	 on	 earth.	 All	 steam	 of sacrifice	will	be	prevented	from	rising	to	Olympus,	and	the	Immortals	will	very soon	 be	 starved	 into	 an	 acceptance	 of	 any	 terms	 proposed.	 The	 new	 Utopia	 is duly	constructed,	and	the	daring	plan	to	secure	the	sovereignty	is	in	a	fair	way	to succeed.	 Meantime	 various	 quacks	 and	 charlatans,	 each	 with	 a	 special	 scheme for	improving	things,	arrive	from	earth,	and	are	one	after	the	other	exposed	and dismissed.	 Presently	 arrives	 Prometheus,	 who	 informs	 Epops	 of	 the	 desperate straits	 to	 which	 the	 gods	 are	 by	 this	 time	 reduced,	 and	 advises	 him	 to	 push	 his claims	 and	 demand	 the	 hand	 of	 Basileia	 (Dominion),	 the	 handmaid	 of	 Zeus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next	 an	 embassy	 from	 the	 Olympians	 appears	 on	 the	 scene,	 consisting	 of Heracles,	 Posidon	 and	 a	 god	 from	 the	 savage	 regions	 of	 the	 Triballians.	 After some	disputation,	it	is	agreed	that	all	reasonable	demands	of	the	birds	are	to	be granted,	 while	 Pisthetaerus	 is	 to	 have	 Basileia	 as	 his	 bride.	 The	 comedy	 winds up	with	the	epithalamium	in	honour	of	the	nuptials. </p>

<p class="calibre1">EUELPIDES	That	Philocrates,	the	bird-seller,	played	us	a	scurvy	trick,	when</p>

<p class="calibre1">f(1)	 A	 king	 of	 Thrace,	 a	 son	 of	 Ares,	 who	 married	 Procne,	 the	 daughter	 of Pandion,	 King	 of	 Athens,	 whom	 he	 had	 assisted	 against	 the	 Megarians.	 He violated	 his	 sister-in-law,	 Philomela,	 and	 then	 cut	 out	 her	 tongue;	 she nevertheless	 managed	 to	 convey	 to	 her	 sister	 how	 she	 had	 been	 treated.	 They both	 agreed	 to	 kill	 Itys,	 whom	 Procne	 had	 borne	 to	 Tereus,	 and	 dished	 up	 the limbs	of	his	own	son	to	the	father;	at	the	end	of	the	meal	Philomela	appeared	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>threw	the	child's	head	upon	the	table.	Tereus	rushed	with	drawn	sword	upon	the princesses,	but	all	the	actors	in	this	terrible	scene	were	metamorph(o)sed.	Tereus became	an	Epops	(hoopoe),	Procne	a	swallow,	Philomela	a	nightingale,	and	Itys</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	goldfinch.	According	to	Anacreon	and	Apollodorus	it	was	Procne	who	became</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	nightingale	and	Philomela	the	swallow,	and	this	is	the	version	of	the	tradition followed	by	Aristophanes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">f(2)	An	Athenian	who	had	some	resemblance	to	a	jay—so	says	the	scholiast, </p>

<p class="calibre1">PISTHETAERUS	It	says	that,	by	dint	of	gnawing,	it	will	devour	my	fingers. </p>

He	is	not	a	citizen, and	 would	 fain	 be	 one	 at	 any	 cost;	 we,	 on	 the	 contrary,	 born	 of	 an	 honourable tribe	and	family	and	living	in	the	midst	of	our	fellow-citizens,	we	have	fled	from our	country	as	hard	as	ever	we	could	go.	'Tis	not	that	we	hate	it;	we	recognize	it to	be	great	and	rich,	likewise	that	everyone	has	the	right	to	ruin	himself;	but	the crickets	 only	 chirrup	 among	 the	 fig-trees	 for	 a	 month	 or	 two,	 whereas	 the Athenians	 spend	 their	 whole	 lives	 in	 chanting	 forth	 judgments	 from	 their	 law-courts.(2)	That	is	why	we	started	off	with	a	basket,	a	stew-pot	and	some	myrtle boughs(3)	 and	 have	 come	 to	 seek	 a	 quiet	 country	 in	 which	 to	 settle.	 We	 are going	to	Tereus,	the	Epops,	to	learn	from	him,	whether,	in	his	aerial	flights,	he has	noticed	some	town	of	this	kind. </p>

<p class="calibre1">And	 what	 important	 services	 do	 not	 the	 birds	 render	 to	 mortals!	 First	 of	 all, they	 mark	 the	 seasons	 for	 them,	 springtime,	 winter,	 and	 autumn.	 Does	 the screaming	crane	migrate	to	Libya,—it	warns	the	husbandman	to	sow,	the	pilot	to</p>

<p class="calibre1">PISTHETAERUS	Oh!	by	the	gods!	how	he	is	cajoling	you.	Step	aside,	that	I</p>

<p class="calibre1">f(1)	Heracles,	the	god	of	strength,	was	far	from	being	remarkable	in	the	way</p>

<p class="calibre1">PISTHETAERUS	 Why,	 certainly;	 are	 you	 not	 born	 of	 a	 stranger	 woman? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Besides,	is	not	Athene	recognized	as	Zeus'	sole	heiress?	And	no	daughter	would</p>

<p class="calibre1">HERACLES	And	I	get	nothing	whatever	of	the	paternal	property? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>PISTHETAERUS	 Absolutely	 nothing.	 But	 tell	 me,	 has	 your	 father	 had	 you entered	on	the	registers	of	his	phratria?(1)</p>
<p class="calibre1">f(1)	The	poet	attributes	to	the	gods	the	same	customs	as	those	which	governed</p>

<p class="calibre1">HERACLES	No,	and	I	have	long	been	surprised	at	the	omission. </p>

<p class="calibre1">POSIDON	 Why	 no,	 he	 does	 not	 say	 anything	 of	 the	 sort,	 that	 he	 gives	 her; else	I	cannot	understand	any	better	than	the	swallows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">PISTHETAERUS	 Exactly	 so.	 Does	 he	 not	 say	 she	 must	 be	 given	 to	 the</p>
